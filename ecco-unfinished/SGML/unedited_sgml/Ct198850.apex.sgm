<HEAD TYPE="sub">JOURNEY I.</HEAD>
<P>_I BEGAN my Travels, where I purpo&s;e to end them, viz. at the city of London, and there|fore my account of the city it&s;elf will come la&s;t; that is to &s;ay, at the latter end of my Southern progre&s;s; and as in the cour&s;e of this journey, I &s;hall have many occa&s;ions to call it a Circuit, if not a Circle, &s;o I cho&s;e to give it the title of Circuits, in the plural, becau&s;e I do not pretend to have travel|led it all in one journey, but in many, and &s;ome of them many times over; the better to inform my&s;elf of every thing I could find worth taking notice of.</P>
<P>I hope it will appear that I am not the le&s;s, but the more capable of giving a full account of things, by how much the more deliberation I have taken in the view of them: and by how much the oftner I have had opportunity to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>I &s;et out the 3d of April, 1722, going fir&s;t Ea&s;tward, and took what I think&punc; I may very hone&s;tly call a Circuit in the very journey of it; for I went down by the coa&s;t of the Thames thro' the Mar&s;hes or Hundreds, on the South|&s;ide of the County of E&s;&s;ex, till I came to Malden&punc; Colche&s;ter, and Harwich; thence continuing on the coa&s;t of Suf|folk to Yarmouth; thence round by the edge of the Sea, on the North and We&s;t|&s;ide of Norfolk, to Lynn, Wiesbich&punc; and the Wa&s;h; thence back again on the North-&s;ide of Suffolk and E&s;&s;ex, to
<PB REF="4" MS="Y">
the We&s;t, ending it in Middle&s;ex, near the place where I began it; re&s;erving the middle or center of the &s;everal coun|ties to &s;ome little excur&s;ions, which I made by them&s;elvs.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing Bow-Bridge, where the coun|ty of E&s;&s;ex begins the fir&s;t ob&s;ervation I made was, That all the villages, which may be called the neighbourhood of the city of London on this, as well as on the other &s;ides thereof, which I &s;hall &s;peak of in their order; I &s;ay, all tho&s;e villages are increa&s;ed in buildings to a &s;trange degree, within the compa&s;s of a|bout twenty or thirty years pa&s;t at the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The village of Stratford, the fir&s;t in this county from London, is not only in|crea&s;ed, but, I believe, more than dou|bled in that time; every vacancy filled up with new hou&s;es, and two little towns, or hamlets, as they may be call|ed, on the fore&s;t &s;ide of the town, en|tirely new, namely, Mary-land&punc;Point, and the Gravel-Pits, one facing the road to Woodford, and Epping, and the other facing the road to Illford: And as for the hither part, it is almo&s;t joined to Bow, in &s;pite of rivers, canals, mar&s;hy grounds, &amp;c. Nor is this increa&s;e of building the ca&s;e only, in this and all other villages round London; but the increa&s;e of the value and rent of the hou&s;es formerly &s;tanding, has, in that compa&s;s of years afore-mentioned, advanced to a very great degree, and I may venture to &s;ay at lea&s;t a fifth part; &s;ome think a third part above what they were before.</P>
<P>This is indeed mo&s;t vi&s;ible, &s;peaking of Stratford in E&s;&s;ex; but it is the &s;ame thing in proportion in other villages ad|jacent, e&s;pecially on the fore&s;t-&s;ide; as at Low-Layton, Layton-&s;tone, Waltham|&s;tow, Woodfo$d, Wan&s;ted, and the rowns of We&s;t-Ham&punc; Plai&s;tow, Upton, &amp;c. In all which places, or near them (as the inhabitants &s;ay$) above a thou&s;and new foundations have been erected be&s;ides old hou&s;es repaired, all &s;ince the revolu|tion: And this is not to be forgotten too, that this increa&s;e is, generally &s;peaking, of hand&s;ome large hou&s;es, from 20l. a year to 60l. very few under 20l. a year, being chiefly for the habitations of the riche&s;t citizens, &s;uch as either are able to keep two hou&s;es, one in the country, and one in the city; or for &s;uch citizens as being rich, and having left off trade, live altogether in the&s;e neighbouring vil|lages, for the plea&s;ure and health of the latter part of their days.</P>
<P>The truth of this may at lea&s;t appear, in that they tell me there are no le&s;s than two hundred coaches kept by the inha|bitants within the circumference of the&s;e few villages named above, be&s;ides &s;uch as are kept by accidental lodgers.</P>
<P>This increa&s;e of the inhabitants, and the cau&s;e of it, I &s;hall inlarge upon when I come to &s;peak of the like in the counties of Middle&s;ex, Surry, &amp;c Where it is the &s;ame, only in a much greater degree: But this I mu&s;t take notice of here, that this increa&s;e cau&s;es tho&s;e vil|lages to be much plea&s;anter and more &s;o|ciable than formerly, for now people go to them, not for retirement into the country, but for good company&punc; of which, that I may &s;peak to the ladies as well as other authors do, there are in the&s;e villages, nay, in all, three or four excepted, excellent conver&s;ation, and a great deal of it, and that without the mixture of a&s;&s;embles, gaming-hou&s;es, and publick foundations of vice and de|bauchery, and particularly, I find none of tho&s;e incentives kept up on this &s;ide the country.</P>
<P>Mr. Camden, and his learned conti|nuator, bi&s;hop Gip&s;on, have ran&s;acked this country for its antiquities&punc; and have left little un&s;earched; and, as it is not my pre&s;ent de&s;ign to &s;ay much of what has been &s;aid already&punc; I &s;hall touch very lightly where to &s;uch excellent antiqua|ries have gone before me; except it be to add what may have been &s;ince di&s;|covered, which as to the&s;e parts is only this, that there &s;eems to be lately found out, in the bottom of the mar&s;hes (ge|nerally called Hackney-Mar&s;h, and be|ginning near about the place now called) the Wyck, between Old-Ford and the &s;aid Wyck, the remains of a great &s;tone
<PB REF="5">
cau&s;eway, which, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, was the highway, or great road from London in|to E&s;&s;ex, and the &s;ame, which goes now over the great bridge between Bow and Stratford.</P>
<P>That the great road lay this way, and that the great cau&s;eway landed again ju&s;t over the river, where now the Tem|ple-Mills &s;tand, and pa&s;&s;ed by Sir Tho. Hickes's hou&s;e at Ruckolls, all this is not doubted; and that it was one of tho&s;e famous highways made by the Ro|mans, there is undoubted proof, by the &s;everal marks of Roman work, and by Roman coins, and other antiquities found there &s;ome of which are &s;aid to be de|po&s;ited in the hands of the Reverend M. Strype, vica&punc; of the pari&s;h of Low-Layton.</P>
<P>From hence the great road pa&s;&s;ed up to Layton-&s;tone, a place by &s;ome known, now as much, by the &s;ign of the Green-Man, formerly a lodge upon the edge of the Fore&s;t; and cro&s;&s;ing by Wan&s;ted hou&s;e, formerly the dwelling of Sir Jo|&s;iah Child, now of his &s;on the lord Ca&s;tle|main, (of which, hereafter) went over the &s;ame river which we now pa&s;s at Ilford; and pa&s;&s;ing that part of the great Fore&s;t which we now call Henault Fore&s;t, came into that which is now the great road, a little on this &s;ide the Whalebone, a place on the road &s;o called, becau&s;e a rib-bone of a great Whale, which was taken in the river of Thames the &s;ame year that Oliver Cromwell died, 1658, was fixed there for a monument of that mon&s;trous creature, it being at fir&s;t about eight and-twenty $oot long.</P>
<P>According to my fir&s;t intention of ef|fectually viewing the Sea-coa&s;t of the&s;e three counties, I went from Stratford to Barking, a large market-town, but chief|ly inhabited by Fi&s;hermen, who&s;e Smacks ride in the Thames, at the mouth of their river, from whence their Fi&s;h is &s;ent up to London, to the market at Billin&s;gate, by &s;mall boats, of which I &s;hall &s;peak by it&s;elf in my de&s;cription of London.</P>
<P>One thing I cannot omit in the men|tion of the&s;e Barking Fi&s;her-Smacks, viz. That one of tho&s;e Fi&s;hermen, a very &s;ub|&s;tantial and experienced man, convinced me, that all the pretences to bringing Fi&s;h alive to London market from the North Seas, and other remote places on the coa&s;t of Great Britain, by the new|built &s;hips called Fi&s;h-Pools, have not been able to do any thing, but what their Fi&s;hing-Smacks are able on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion to perform. The&s;e Fi&s;h|ing-Smacks are very u&s;eful ve&s;&s;els to the publick upon many occa&s;ions; as particu|larly, in time of war they are u&s;ed as Pre&s;s-Smacks running to all the North|ern and We&s;tern coa&s;ts to pick up Sea|men to mann the Navy, when any expe|dition is at hand that requires a &s;udden equipment: At other times, being ex|cellent Sailors, they are tenders to parti|cular Men of War; and on an expedition they have been made u&s;e of as machines, for the blowing up fortified Ports and Havens, as at Calais, St. Maloes, and other places.</P>
<P>This pari&s;h of Barking is very large; and by the improvement of lands taken in, out of the Thames, and out of the river which runs by the town, the tithes, as the town&s;men a&s;&s;ured me, are worth above 600 l. per annum, including &s;mall tithes. Note, This pari&s;h has two or three chapels of ca&s;e, viz. One at Ilford, and one on the &s;ide of Henault Fore&s;t, called New Chapel.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Fan&s;haw, of an ancient Roman Catholick family, has a very good e&s;tate in this pari&s;h: A little beyond the town, on the road to Dagenham, &s;tood a great hou&s;e, ancient, and now almo&s;t fallen down, where tradition &s;ays, the $unpowder Trea&s;on Plot was at fir&s;t con|triv'd, and that all the fir&s;t con&s;ultations about it were held there.</P>
<P>This &s;ide of the county is rather rich in land than in inhabitants, occa&s;ioned chiefly by the unhealthine&s;s of the air; for the&s;e low Mar&s;h Grounds, which, with all the South &s;ide of the county, have been &s;aved out of the river Thames, and out of the Sea, where the river is wide enough to be call'd &s;o, begin here, or rather begin at We&s;t Ham, by Strat|ford and continue to extend them&s;elves.
<PB REF="6">
From hence Ea&s;tward, growing wider and wider, till we come beyond Tilbu|ry, when the &s;lat country lies &s;ix, &s;even, or eight miles broad, and is ju&s;tly &s;aid to be both unhealthy, and unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>However the lands are rich, and, as is ob&s;ervable, it is very good farming in the Mar&s;hes, becau&s;e the landlords let good pennyworths&punc; for it being a place where every body cannot live; tho&s;e that venture it, will have encourage|ment, and indeed it is but rea&s;onable they &s;hould.</P>
<P>Several little ob&s;ervations I made in this part of the county of E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;aw, pa&s;&s;ing from Barking to Dagenham, the famous Breach, made by an inundation of the Thames, which was &s;o great, as that it laid near 5000 acres of land under water, but which after near 10 years lying under water, and being &s;everal times blown up, has been at la&s;t effectually &s;topped, by the application of captain Perry; the gen|tleman, who for &s;everal years had been employed, in the Czar of Mu&s;covy's works, at Veronitza, on the river Don This Breach appeared now effectually made up, and they a&s;&s;ured us, that the new work, where the Breach was, is by much e&s;teemed the &s;tronge&s;t of all the &s;ea walls in that level.</P>
<P N="2">2 It was ob&s;ervable, that great part of the lands in the&s;e levels, e&s;pecially tho&s;e on this &s;ide Ea&s;t Tilbury, are held by the Farmers, Cow-keepers, and gra|$ing Butchers, who live in and near London, and that they are generally &s;tocked (all the winter half year) with large fat Sheep, viz.) Lincoln&s;hire and Leice&s;ter&s;hire wethers, which they buy in Smithfield, in September and Octo|ber, when the Lincoln&s;hire and Leice&s;|ter&s;hire Gra&s;iers &s;ell off their &s;tock, and are kept here till Chri&s;tmas, or Candle|mas, or thereabouts, and though they are not made at all fatter here, than they were when bought in, yet the Farmer, or Butcher, finds very good anvantage in it, by the difference of the price $word$ Mutton between Michaelmas when it if cheape&s;t, and Candlemas when 'tis dear|e&s;t; this is what the Butchers value them&s;elves upon, when they tell us at the Market, that it is right March-Mutton.</P>
<P N="3">3 In the bottom of the&s;e Mar&s;hes, and clo&s;e to the edge of the river, &s;tands the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Tilbury, called Tilbury Fort, which may ju&s;tly be look|ed upon, as the Key of the river of Thames, and con&s;equently the Key of the city of London: It is a regular for|tification, the de&s;ign of it was a Penta|gon, but the water Ba&s;tion, as it would have been called, was never built; the Plan was laid out by Sir Martin Beck|man, chief engineer to king Charles II. who al&s;o de&s;igned the works at Sheer|ne&s;s. The E&s;planade of the fort is very large, and the Ba&s;tions, the large&s;t of any in England, the foundation is laid &s;o deep, and piles under that, driven down two an end of one another, &s;o far, till they were a&s;&s;ured they were below the channel of the river, and that the piles, which were &s;hod with Iron, en|tered into the &s;olid Chalk-Rock adjoin|ing to, or reaching from the Chalk-hills on the other &s;ide. The&s;e Ba&s;tions &s;ettled con&s;iderably at fir&s;t, as did al&s;o part of the Curtain, the great quantity of Earth that was brought to fill them up, nece&s;|&s;arily, requiring to be made &s;olid by Time; but they are now firm as the Rocks of Chalk which they came from, and the filling up one of the&s;e Ba&s;tions, as I have been told by good hands, co&s;t the Government 6000 l. being filled with Chalk-Rubbi&s;h, fetched from the Chalk-Pits at North fleet, ju&s;t above Grave&s;end.</P>
<P>The works to the land &s;ide are com|pleat; the Ba&s;tions are faced with Brick. There is a double Ditch, or Moat, the innermo&s;t part of which is 180 foot broad, there is a good Counter&s;carp, and a covered way marked out, with Rave|lins, and Tenailles, but they are not rai&s;|ed a &s;econd time after their fir&s;t &s;ettling.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
On the land &s;ide there are al&s;o two &s;mall redoubts of Brick, but of very little &s;trength, for the chief &s;trength of this Fort on the land &s;ide con&s;i&s;ts in this, that they are able to lay the whole level under water, and &s;o make it impo&s;&s;ible for an enemy to make any approaches to the Fort that way.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide next the river, there is a very &s;trong curtain, with a noble gate called the water-gate in the middle, and the ditch is pal$i&s;aded. At the place where the water-ba&s;tion was de&s;igned to be built, and which by the plan &s;hould run wholly out into the river&punc; &s;o to flank the two curtains on each &s;ide: I &s;ay, in the place where it &s;hould have been, &s;tands a high tower, which they tell us was built in queen Elizabeth's time, and was called the block-hou&s;e, the &s;ide next the water is vacant.</P>
<P>Before this curtain above and below the &s;aid vacancy, is a platform in the place of a counter&s;carp, on which are planted 106 pieces of cannon, generally all of them carrying from 24 to 46 pound ball; a battery, &s;o terrible, as well im|ports the con&s;equence of that place: Be|&s;ides which, there are &s;maller pieces planted between, and the ba&s;tions and curtain al&s;o are planted with guns; &s;o that they mu&s;t be bold fellows who will venture in the bigge&s;t &s;hips the world has heard of, to pa&s;s &s;uch a battery, if the men appointed to &s;erve the guns, do their duty like &s;tout Fellows, as becomes them.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent government of this impor|tant place is under the prudent admini|&s;tration of the Right Honourable the lord Newbrugh.</P>
<P>From hence, there is nothing for many miles together remarkable, but a conti|nued level of unhealthy Mar$hes&punc; called, the Three Hundreds, till we come be|fore Leigh, and to the mouth of the river Chelmer, and Black-water. The&s;e rivers united make a large Frith, or In|let of the Sea, which by Mr. Camden is called Idumanum Fluvium; but by our Fi&s;hermen and Seamen, who u&s;e it as a port, 'tis called Malden-Water.</P>
<P>In this Inlet of the Sea is O&s;ey or O&s;yth I&s;land, commonly called Oo&s;y I&s;land, &s;o well known by our London men of plea&s;ure, for the infinite number of Wild-Fowl, that is to &s;ay, Duck, Mallard, Teal and Widgeon, of which there are &s;uch va&s;t flights, that they tell us the I&s;|land, namely the Creek, &s;eems covered with them, at certain times of the year, and they go from London on purpo&s;e for the plea&s;ure of &s;hooting; and indeed often come home very well loaden with game. But it mu&s;t be remembred too, that tho&s;e gentlemen who are &s;uch lov|ers of the &s;port, and go &s;o far for it, of|ten return with an E&s;&s;ex Ague on their backs, which they find a heavier load than the fowls they have &s;hot.</P>
<P>'Tis on this &s;hoar, and near this Creek, that the g eate&s;t quantity of fre&s;h fi&s;h is caught, which &s;upplies not this country only, but London markets al&s;o. On the &s;hoar beginning a little below Candy I&s;land, or rather below Leigh road, there lies a great &s;hoal o$ &s;and called the Black Tayl, which runs out near three leagues into the Sea due Ea&s;t; at the end of it, &s;tands a pole o$ ma&s;t, &s;et up by the Trinity-Hou&s;e men of London, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is, to lay buoys, and &s;et up Sea marks for the di|rection of the Sailors; this is called Shoo-Bacon&punc; from the point of land $here this &s;and begins, which is call'd Shooberry-Ne&s;s, and that from the town of Shoober|ry&punc; which &s;tands by it. From this &s;and, and on the edge of Shooberry, before it, or South-We&s;t of it, all along&punc; to the mouth of Colche&s;ter water, the &s;hoar is full of &s;hoals and &s;ands, which &s;ome deep channels between; all which are &s;o full of fi&s;h, that not only the Ba$king fi&s;hing-Smacks come hither to fi&s;h, but the whole &s;hoar is full of &s;mall fi&s;her-Boats in very great numbers, belonging to the villages and to $ns on the coa&s;t, who come in every tide with what they take, and &s;elling the &s;maller fi&s;h in the country, &s;end the be&s;t and large&s;t away upon hor&s;es, which go night and day to London market.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">
N. B. I am the more particular in my remark on this place, becau&s;e in the cour&s;e of my travels the $word$ will meet with the like in almo&s;t every place of note through the whole I&s;land, where it will be &s;een how this whole kingdom, as well the People, as the Land, and even the Sea, in every part of it, are em|ploy'd to furni&s;h &s;omething, and I may add, the be&s;t of every thing, to &s;upply the city of London with provi&s;ions; I m an by provi&s;ions, Corn, Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, Butter, Chee&s;e, Salt, Fewel, Timber, &amp;c. and Cloths al&s;o; with every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary for building, and furniture for their own u&s;e, or for trade; of all which in their order.</P>
<P>On this Shoar al&s;o are taken the be&s;t and nice&s;t, though not the large&s;t Oy&s;ters in England; the &s;pot from whence they have their common appellation is a little bank called Woelfleet, &s;carce to be call|ed an I&s;land, in the mouth of the river Crouch, now called Crook&s;ea Water; but the chief place where the &s;aid Oy&s;ters are now had, is from Wyvenhoo and the Shoars adjacent, whither they are brought by the Fi&s;hermen, who take them at the mouth of, that they call, Colche&s;ter Water, and about the &s;and they call the Spits, and carry them up to Wyvenhoo, where they are laid in beds, or pits, on the &s;hoar to feed, as they call it, and then being barrelled up, and car|ried to Colche&s;ter, which is but three miles off, they are &s;ent to London by land, and are, from thence, called Col|che&s;ter Oy&s;ters.</P>
<P>The chief &s;ort of other Fi&s;h which they carry from this part of the &s;hoar to London, are Soals, which they take &s;ometimes exceeding large, and yield a very good price at London market: Al|&s;o &s;ometimes middling Turbet, with Whitings, Codling, and large Flounders; the &s;mall Fi&s;h as above, they &s;ell in the Country.</P>
<P>In the &s;everal creeks and openings, as above, on this &s;hoar, there are al&s;o other I&s;lands, but of no particular note, except Mer&s;ey, which lies in the middle of the two openings, between Malden and Colche&s;ter water; being of the mo&s;t difficult acce&s;s, &s;o that 'tis thought a thou&s;and men well provided, might keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it again&s;t a great force, whether by land or &s;ea; on this account, and becau&s;e if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an enemy, it would &s;hut up all the navigation and fi&s;hery on that &s;ide: The government formerly built a Fort on the South-East point of it: And generally, in ca&s;e of a Dutch war, there is a &s;trong body of troops kept there to defend i$.</P>
<P>At this place may be &s;aid to end what we call the Hundreds of E&s;&s;ex; that is to &s;ay, the three hundreds or divi&s;ions, which include the mar&s;hy country, viz. Barn&s;table hundred, Rochford hundred, and Dengy hundred.</P>
<P>I have one remark more, before I leave this damp part of the world, and which I cannot omit on the womens ac|count; namely, that I took notice of a &s;trange decay of the Sex here, in&s;omuch, that all along this county it was very fre|quent to meet with men that had had from five or &s;ix, to fourteen or fifteen wives; nay, and &s;ome more; and I was inform'd that in the Mar&s;hes on the other &s;ide the river over-again&s;t Candy I&s;land, there was a Farmer, who was then liv|ing with the five and twentieth wi&s;e, and that his &s;on who was but about 35 years old, had already had about four|teen; indeed this part of the &s;tory, I only had by report, tho' from good hands too; but the other is well known, and ea&s;y to be inquired into, about Fobbing, Curringham, Thunder&s;ly, Ben&s;leet, Prit|tlewell, Wakering, Great Stambridge, Crick&s;ea, Burnham, Dengy, and other towns of the like &s;ituation: The rea&s;on, as a merry follow told me, who &s;aid he had had about a dozen and half of wives, (tho' I found afterwards he fibb'd a little) was this; That they being bred in the Mar&s;hes them&s;elves, and &s;ea&s;on'd to t he place, did pretty well with it; but that they always went up into the hilly country, or to &s;peak their own

language into the Uplands for a wife: That when they took the young la&s;&s;es out of the whole&s;ome and fre&s;h air, they were healthy, fre&s;h, and clear, and well; but when they came out of their native air into the Mar&s;hes, among the fogs and damps, there they pre&s;ently chang'd their complection, got an Ague or two, and &s;eldom held it above half a year, or a year at mo&s;t; and then, &s;aid he, we go to the Uplands again, and fetch another; &s;o that marrying of wives was reckon'd a kind of good farm to them: it is true, the fellow told this in a kind of drollery, and mirth; but the fact, for all that, is certainly true; and that they have abun|dance of wives by that very means: Nor is it le&s;s true, that the inhabitants in the&s;e places do not hold it out, as in other counties, and as fir&s;t you &s;eldom meet with very ancient people among the poor, as in other places we do, &s;o, take it one with another, not one half of the inhabitants are natives of this place; but &s;uch as from other countries, or in other parts of this county &s;ettle here for the advantage of good farms&punc; forwhich I appeal to any impartial enquiry, having my&s;elf examin'd into it critically in &s;everal places.</P>
<P>From the Mar&s;hes, and low grounds, being not able to travel without many windings, and indentures, by rea&s;on of the c$eeks, and waters, I came up to the town of Malden, a noted market town &s;ituate at the conflux or joyning of two principal rivers in this county, the Chelm or Chemler, and the Blackwater, and where they enter into the Sea. The Channel, as I have noted, is call'd by the &s;ailors Malden-Water, and is naviga|ble up to the town, where, by that means, is a great trade for carrying Corn by water to London; the county of E&s;&s;ex being (e&s;pecially on all that &s;ide) a great Corn country.</P>
<P>When I have &s;aid this, I think I have done Malden ju&s;tice, and &s;aid all of it that there is to be &s;aid, unle&s;s I &s;hould run into the old &s;tory of its antiquity, and tell you it was a Roman Colony in the time of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, and that it was called Ca|molodunum. How the Britons under queen Boadicia, in revenge for the Ro|mans ill u&s;age of her $span$ u&s;ed her maje&s;ty ill; they &s;tripp'd the naked, and whipped her publickly thro' their &s;treets for &s;ome affront &s;he had given them. I &s;ay, how for this, &s;he rais'd the Britons round the country, over-powered, and cut in peices the tenth legion, killed above eighty thou&s;and Ro|mans, and de&s;troy'd the Colony; but was afterwards over-thrown again in a great Battle, and &s;ixty thou&s;and Britons &s;lain. I &s;ay, unle&s;s I &s;hould enter into this &s;tory, I have nothing more to &s;ay of Malden, and as for that &s;tory, it is &s;o fully related by Mr. Camden, in his hi&s;tory of the Romans in Britain, at the beginning of his Britannia, that I need only refer the reader to it, and go on with my journey.</P>
<P>Being obliged to come thus far into the Uplands, as above, I made it my road to pa&s;s thro' Witham, a plea&s;ant well &s;itu|ated market-town, in which, and in its neighbourhood, there are as many gen|tlemen of good fortunes, and families, as I believe can be met with in &s;o narrow a compa&s;s in any of the three counties, of which I make this Circuit.</P>
<P>In the town of Wi ham dwels the lord Pa&s;ely, elde&s;t &s;on of the earl of Abercorne of Ireland, (a b anch of the noble family of Tamilton, in Scotland:) his lord&s;hip has a &s;mall, but a neat well built new hou&s;e, and is fini&s;hing his gardens in &s;uch a manner, as few in that part of England will exceed them.</P>
<P>Nearer Chelmsford, hard by Boreham, lives the lord vi&s;count Barrington, who tho' not born to the title or e&s;tate or name which he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, had the honour to be twice made heir to the e&s;tates of gentlemen, not at all related to him, at lea&s;t one of them as is very much to his honour mention'd in his pa|tent of Creation. His name was Shute&punc; his father a linnen draper in London, and &s;erv'd Sheriff of the $word$ city, in very trouble&s;ome times. He chang'd the name of Shute, for that of Barrington, by an act of parliament, obtain'd for that purpo&s;e, and had the dignity of a Baron of the kingdom conferred on him by the $avour of king George. His lord|&s;hip is a $span$
<PB REF="10">
He was a member of parlia|ment for the town of Berwick upon Tweed.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of Witham, at Fau|burn, an ancient man&s;ion hou&s;e, built by the Romans, lives Mr. Bullock, who&s;e father married the daughter of that emi|nent citizen, Sir Jo&s;iah Child of Wan|&s;ted, by whom &s;he had three &s;ons, the elde&s;t enjoys the e&s;tate, which is con|derable.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that in this part of the country, there are &s;everal very con&s;idera|ble e&s;tates purchas'd, and now enjoy'd by citizens of London, merchants, and trade&s;men, as Mr. We&s;tern an Iron mer|chant, near Kelendon, Mr. Cre&s;nor, a whole&s;ale Grocer, who was, a little be|fore, he died, nam'd for Sheriff at Earls Coln, Mr. Ol$mus, a merchant at Brain|tree, Mr. We&s;tcomb, near Malden, Sir Thomas Web&s;ter at Copthall, near Wal|tham, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>I mention this to ob&s;erve how the pre&s;ent encrea&s;e of wealth in the city of London, &s;preads it&s;elf into the country, and plants families and fortunes, who in another age will equal the families of the ancient gentry, who perhaps were brought out. I &s;hall take notice of this in a general head, and when I have run thro' all the counties, collect a li&s;t of the families of citizens and trade&s;men thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;everal counties, e&s;pe|cially round London.</P>
<P>The product of all this part of the coun|try is Corn, as that of the Mar&s;hy feeding grounds mention'd above is Gra&s;s, where their chief bu&s;ine&s;s is breeding of Calves, which I need not &s;ay are the be&s;t and fatte&s;t and the large&s;t Veal in England, if not in the world; and as an in&s;tance, I eat part of a Veal or Calf, fed by the late Sir Jo&s;iah Child at Wan&s;tead, the Loyn of which weigh'd above 30 l. and the fle&s;h exceeding white and fat.</P>
<P>From hence I went on to Colche&s;ter: The &s;tory of Kill Dane, which is told of the town of Kelvedon, three miles from Witham, namely, That this is the place where the ma&s;&s;acre of the Danes was begun by the Women, and that there|fore it was call'd Kill-Dane. I &s;ay of it, as we generally &s;ay of improbable news, it wants confirmation. The true name of the town is Kelvedon, and has been &s;o for many hundred years. Neither does Mr. Camden, or any other writer I meet with worth naming, in&s;i&s;t on this piece of empty tradition the town is commonly called Keldon.</P>
<P>Colche&s;ter is an antient corporation; the town is large, very populous; the &s;treets fair and beautiful; and though it may not be &s;aid to be finely built, yet there are abundance of very good and well built hou&s;es in it: It &s;till mourns, in the ruins of a Civil War; during which, or rather after the heat of the War was over, it &s;uffered a &s;evere &s;iege; which, the Garri&s;on making a re&s;olute defence, was turned into a Blockade, in which the garri&s;on and inhabitants al&s;o, &s;uffered the utmo&s;t extremity of hunger, and were at la&s;t obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, when their two chief officers, Sir Charles Lucas, and Sir George Li&s;le, were &s;hot to death under the ca&s;tle-wall. The inhabitants had a Tradition, that no Gra&s;s would grow upon the &s;pot where the blood of tho&s;e two gallant gentlemen was &s;pilt; and they &s;hewed the place bare of Gra&s;s for many years, but whether for this rea&s;on I will not affirm; the &s;tory is now dropp'd, and the Gra&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e, grows there as in other places.</P>
<P>However, the battered Walls, the breaches in the Turrets, and the ruined Churches &s;till remain, except that the church of St. Mary's (where they had the royal Fort) is rebuilt; but the &s;teeple, which was two thirds batter'd down, becau&s;e the be&s;ieged had a large Culve|$ine upon it, that did much execution, remains &s;till in that condition.</P>
<P>There is another church which bears the marks of tho&s;e Times, namely, on the South &s;ide of the town, in the way to the Hithe, of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>The lines of Contravallation, with the Forts built by the be&s;iegers, and
<PB REF="11" MS="Y">
which &s;urrounded the whole town, re|main very vi&s;ible in many places; but the chief of them are demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The river Coln, which pa&s;&s;es through this Town, compa&s;&s;es it on the North and Ea&s;t &s;ides, and &s;erved in tho&s;e times for a compleat defence on tho&s;e &s;ides. They have three bridges over it, one called North bridge, at the North gate, by which the road leads into Suffolk; one called Ea&s;t bridge, at the foot of the high &s;treet, over which lies he road to Harwich, and one at the Hithe, as a|bove.</P>
<P>The river is navigable wi hin three miles of the town for &s;hips of large bur|then; a little lower it may receive even a royal Navy: And up to that part cal|led the Hithe, clo&s;e to the hou&s;es, it is navigable for Hoys and &s;mall Barks. This Hithe is a long &s;treet, pa&s;&s;ing from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, on the South &s;ide of the town; at the We&s;t end of it, there is a &s;mall intermi&s;&s;ion of the buildings, but not much; and towards the river it is very populous; (it may be called the Wapping of Colche&s;ter) there is one church in that part of the town, a large Key to the river, and a good Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The town may be &s;aid chiefly to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t by the trade of making Bays, which is known over mo&s;t of the trading parts of Europe, by the name of Colche&s;ter Bays, though indeed all the towns round carry on the &s;ame tade namely, Kel|vedon, Whittham, Cogg&s;hall, Braintree, Bocking, &amp;c. and the whole county, large as it is, may be &s;aid to be employ|ed, and in part maintained, by the &s;pin|ning of Wool for the Bay trade of Col|che&s;ter, and its adjacent towns. The Account of the &s;iege, Anno 1648, with a DIARY of the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;|&s;ages, are as follows, which I had from &s;o good a Hand, as that I have no rea&s;on to que&s;tion its being a true Relation.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>A DIARY: Or, an Account of the Siege and Blockade of Colche&s;ter, Anno 1648.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 4th of June, we were alarmed in the town of Col|che&s;ter, that the lord Goring, the lord Capel, and a body of 2000 of the loyal party, who had been in arms in Kent, having left a great bo|dy of an army in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Roche&s;ter Bridge, where they re&s;olved to fight $he lord Fairfax, and the parliament ar|my; had given the &s;aid General Fairfax the &s;lip, and having pa&s;s'd at Greenwich, were con$ to Stratford, and were ad|vancing this way: Upon which new$, Sir Charles Lucas, Sir George Li&s;le, Col. Cook, and &s;everal gentlemen of the loyal army, and all that $ad commi&s;&s;ions from the king, with a gallant appearance of gentlemen volunteers, drew together from all parts of the country, to join with them.</P>
<P>The 8th we were further informed, that they were advanc'd to Chelmsford, to New-Hall hou&s;e, and to Witham; and the 9th, &s;ome of the hor&s;e arrived in the town, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gates, and having ingeneers wi$h them, told us, that General Goring had re&s;olv'd to make this town his head quarters, and would cau&s;e it to be well fortified; they al&s;o cau&s; d the drums to beat for volunteers; and a good number of the poor Bay-Weavers, and &s;uch like people, wanting employment, li&s;ted: So that they com|pleated Sir Charles Lucas's regiment, which was but thin, to near eight hun|dred men.</P>
<P><PB REF="12">
On the 10th we had news, that the lord Fairfax having beaten the Royali&s;ts at Maid&s;tone, and re-taken Roche&s;ter, had pa&s;s'd the Thames at Grave&s;end, though with great difficulty, and with &s;ome lo&s;s, and was come to Horndon on the Hill, in order to gain Colche&s;ter be|fore the Royali&s;ts; but that hearing Sir Charles Lucas had prevented him, had ordered his Rendezvous at Billerecay, and intended to po&s;&s;e&s;s the pa&s;s at Mal|den on the 11th, where Sir Thomas Ho|neywood, with the county trained bands, was to be the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>The &s;ame evening the lord Goring, with all his forces, making about 5600 men, hor&s;e and foot, came to Colche&s;|ter and encamping without the &s;uburbs, under command of the Cannon of St. Mary's fort, made di&s;po&s;ition to fight the Parliament forces, if they came up.</P>
<P>The 12th, the Lord Goring came in|to Colche&s;ter, viewed the fort in St. Ma|ry's church-yard ordered more cannon to be planted upon it; po&s;ted two regi|ments in the &s;uburbs, without the head gate; let the town know he would take them into his Maje&s;ty s protection; and that he would fight the enemy in that &s;ituation. The &s;ame evening, the lord Fairfax, with a &s;trong party of 1000 hor&s;e came to Lexden, at two &s;mall miles di&s;tance, expecting the re&s;t of his army there, the &s;ame night.</P>
<P>The lord Goring brought in pri&s;oners the &s;ame day, Sir William Ma&s;ham, and &s;everal other gentlemen of the county, who were &s;ecured under a &s;trong guard; which the parliament hearing, order'd twenty pri&s;oners of the royal party to be &s;ingl'd out, declaring, that they &s;hould be u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as the lord Goring u&s;ed Sir William Ma&s;ham, and the gentlemen pri&s;oners with him.</P>
<P>O$ the 13th early in the morning, our &s;pies brought intelligence, that the lord Fairfax, all his forces being come up to him, was making di&s;po&s;itions for a march, re&s;olving to attack the royali&s;ts in their camp: Upon which, the lord Go$ing drew up all his forces together, re&s;olving to fight. The ingeneers had offered the night before to intrench his camp, and to draw a line round it in one night's time, but his lord&s;hip declined it, and now there was no time for it: Whereupon the general, lord Goring, drew up his army in order of battle&punc; on both &s;ides the road, the hor&s;e in the o|pen fields on the wings; the foot were drawn up, one regiment in the road, one regiment on each &s;ide, and two regiments for re&s;erve in the &s;uburb, ju&s;t at the en|trance of the town, with a regiment of voluntiers, advanced as a forlorn hope, and a regiment of hor&s;e at the head gate, ready to &s;upport the re&s;erve, as occa&s;ion &s;hould require.</P>
<P>About nine in the morning we heard the enemies drums beat a march, and in half an hour more their fir&s;t troops appeared on the higher grounds towards Lexden; immediately the cannon from St. Mary's fired upon them, and put &s;ome troops of hor&s;e into confu&s;ion, do|ing great execution; which, they not being able to &s;hun it, made them quick|en their pace, fall on, when our cannon were obliged to cea&s;e firing, left we &s;hould hurt our own troops, as well as the enemy: Soon after, their foot ap|peared, and our cannon &s;aluted them in like manner, and killed them a great many men.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t line of foot was led up by col. Bark&s;tead, and con&s;i&s;ted of three re|giments of foot, making about $word$ men, and the&s;e charged our regiment in the lane, commanded by Sir George Li&s;le, and Sir William Campton: They fell on with great fury, and were received with as much gallantry, and three times re|pul&s;ed, nor could they break in here, though the lord Fairfax &s;ent fre&s;h men to &s;upport them, till the Royali&s;ts hor&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed with numbers on the left, were obliged to retire, and at la&s;t, to come full gallop into the &s;treet, and &s;o on into the town: Nay, &s;till the foot &s;tood firm, and the voluntiers, being all gentlemen, kept their ground with the greate&s;t re|&s;olution: But the left wing being rout|ed, as above, Sir William Camton was obliged to make a front to the left; and
<PB REF="13">
lining the hedge with his mu&s;quereers, made a &s;tand with a body of pikes again&s;t the enemy's Hor&s;e, and prevented them entering the lane. Here that gallant gentleman was kill'd with a Carabine &s;hot; and after a very gallant re&s;i&s;tance, the Hor&s;e on the right being al&s;o over|power'd, the word was given to retreat; which however was done in &s;uch good order, the regiments of re&s;erve &s;tanding drawn up at the end of the &s;treet, ready to receive the enemy's Hor&s;e upon the points of their pikes, that the Royal Troops came on in the openings be|tween the regiments, and entered the town with very little lo&s;s, and in very good order.</P>
<P>By this, however, tho&s;e regiments of re&s;erve, were brought, at la&s;t, to &s;u&s;tain the efforts of the enemy's whole army, till being overpower'd by numbers, they were put into di&s;order, and forced to get into the town in the be&s;t manner they could; by which means near 200 men were kill'd or made pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, the enemy pu&s;h'd on, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould enter the town pelmel with the re&s;t; nor did the Royali&s;ts hinder them, but let good part of Bark&s;ted's own regiment enter the head gate; but then &s;allying from St. Mary's with a choice body of Foot on the left, and the Hor&s;e rallying in the High-&s;treet, and charging them again in the front, they were driven back quite into $word$ &s;treet of the &s;uburb, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e that had &s;o ra&s;hly enter'd, were cut in pieces.</P>
<P>Thus they were repul&s;ed at the South entrance into the town; and tho' they attempted to &s;torm three times after that with re&s;olution, yet they were as often beaten back, and that with great ha|vock of their men; and the Cannon from the Fort all the while did execution upon tho&s;e who &s;tood drawn up to &s;upport them: So at la&s;t &s;eeing no good to be done, they retreated, having &s;mall joy of their pretended victory.</P>
<P>They lo&s;t in this action Colonel Need|ham, who commanded a negiment call'd the Tower Guards, and who fought very de&s;perately; Capt. Cox, an old ex|perienc'd Hor&s;e officer, and &s;everal others officers of note, with a great many pri|vate men, tho' as they had the field they concealed their number, giving out, they lo&s;t but an hundred, when we were a&s;&s;ured, they lo&s;t near a thou&s;and men be&s;ides the wounded.</P>
<P>They took &s;ome of our men pri&s;oners, occa&s;ion'd by the regiment of Colonel Farr, and two more, &s;u&s;taining the &s;hock of their whole army, to &s;ecure the retreat of the main body, as above.</P>
<P>The 16th, the lord Fairfax finding he was not able to carry the town by &s;torm, without the formality of a &s;iege, took his head quarters at Lexden, and &s;ent to London, and to Suffolk for more forces; al&s;o he order'd the Trained Bands to be rai&s;ed, and po&s;ted on the roads, to pre|vent &s;uccours; notwith&s;tanding which, divers gentlemen, with &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance of men and arms, found means to get in|to the town.</P>
<P>The very &s;ame night they began to break ground; and particularly, $o rai&s;e a Fort between Colche&s;ter and Lexden, to cover the Generals quarter from the &s;alleys from the town; for the Royali&s;ts having a good body of Hor&s;e, gave them no re&s;t, but &s;cour'd the fields every day, and falling upon all that were found &s;traggling from their po&s;ts, and by this means kill'd a great many.</P>
<P>The 17th, Sir Charles Lucas having been out with twelve hundred Hor&s;e, and detaching parties towards the Sea|&s;ide, and towards Harwich, they brought in a very great quantity of provi&s;ions, and abundance of Sheep and Black Cattle, &s;ufficient for the town for a con&s;iderable time; and had not the Suf|folk forces advanced over Cataway-Bridge to prevent it, a larger &s;upply had been b ought in that way; for now it appeared plainly, that the lord Fairfax finding the garri&s;on &s;trong and re&s;olute, and that he was not in a condition to reduce them by force, at lea&s;t without the lo&s;s of much blood,
<PB REF="14" MS="Y">
had re&s;olved to turn his &s;iege into a blockade, and reduce them by hunger; their troops being al&s;o wanted to oppo&s;e &s;everal other parties, who had, in &s;eve|ral parts of the kingdom, taken arms, for King's cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;ame day General Fairfax &s;ent in a Trumpet, to propo&s;e exchanging pri&s;oners, which the lord Goring rejected, expecting a reinforcement of Troops, which were actually coming to him, and were to be at Linton in Cambridg&s;hire as the next day.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day two &s;hips brought in a quantity of Corn and provi&s;ions, and 56 men from the &s;hore of Kent with &s;everal gentlemen, who all landed, and came up to the town, and the greate&s;t part of the Corn was with the utmo&s;t applica|tion unloaded the &s;ame night into &s;ome Hoys, which brought it up to the Hithe, being apprehen&s;ive of the parliaments &s;hips which lay at Harwich, who ha|ving intelligence of the &s;aid &s;hips, came the next day into the mouth of the river, and took the &s;aid two &s;hips, and what Corn was left in them. The be&s;ieg'd &s;ent out a party to help the &s;hips, but ha|ving no boats they could not a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P N="18">18. Sir Charles Lucas &s;ent an an&s;wer about exchange of pri&s;oners, accepting the conditions offer'd, but the parliaments General returned that he would not treat with Sir Charles, for that he Sir Charles being his pri&s;oner upon his parole of honour, and having appear'd in arms contrary to the rules of war, had forfeited his honour and faith, and was not capable of command or tru&s;t in martial affairs: To this Sir Charles &s;ent back an an&s;wer, and his excu&s;e for the breach of his pa|role, but it was not accepted, nor would the lord Fairfax enter upon any treaty with him.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;econd me&s;&s;age, Sir William Ma&s;ham, and the parliament committee and other gentlemen, who were pri&s;on|ers in the town, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age in writ|ing under their hands to the lord Fairfax, intreating him to enter into a treaty for peace; but the lord Fairfax returned, he could take no notice of their reque&s;t, as &s;uppo&s;ing it forced from them under re&s;traint; but, that, if the lord Goring de&s;ir'd peace, he might write to the par|liament, and he would cau&s;e his me&s;&s;en|ger to have a &s;afe conduct to carry his letter: There was a paper &s;ent enclo&s;ed in this paper, &s;ign'd Capel, Norwich, Charles, Lucas, but to that the General would return no an&s;wer, becau&s;e it was &s;ign'd by Sir Charles, for the rea&s;ons above.</P>
<P>All this while, the lord Goring, finding the enemy &s;trengthning them&s;elves, gave order for fortifying the town, and draw|ing lines in &s;everal places, to &s;ecure the entrance, as particularly without the Ea&s;t bridge, and without the North gate and bridge, and to plant more Cannon upon the works: To which end, &s;ome great Guns were brought in from &s;ome &s;hips at Wevenhoe.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, our men &s;ally'd out in three places, and attack'd the be&s;iegers, fir&s;t at their Fort, call'd Effex; then at their new works, on the South of the town; a third party &s;allying at the Ea&s;t bridge, brought in &s;ome booty from the Suffolk troops, having killed &s;everal of their &s;traglers on the Harwich road: They al&s;o took a Lieutenant of Hor&s;e pri|&s;oner, and brought him into the town.</P>
<P N="19">19. This day we had the unwelcome news, that our friends at Linton were de|&s;eated by the enemy, and Major Mu&s;|champ, a loyal gentleman, kill'd.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night, our men gave the enemy alarm at their new E&s;&s;ex Fort, and the$eby drew them out as if they would fight, till they brought them with|in reach of the Cannon of St. Mary's, and then our men retiring, the great Guns let fly among them, and made them run: Our men &s;houted after them; &s;e|veral of them were kill d on this occa&s;ion, one &s;hot having kill'd three Hor&s;emen in our &s;ight.</P>
<P N="20">20. We now found the enemy in order to a perfect blockade, re&s;olv'd to draw a line of circumvallation, round the town; having receiv'd a train of forty pieces of heavy Cannon from the tower of Lon|don.</P>
<P><PB REF="15" MS="Y">
This day the Parliament &s;ent a me&s;|&s;enger to their pri&s;oners, to know how they far'd, and how they were u&s;ed; who returned word, that they far'd in|differently well, and were very civilly u&s;ed, but that provi&s;ions were &s;carce and therefore dear.</P>
<P>This day a party of hor&s;e with 300 foot, &s;ally'd out, and marched as far as the fort on the I&s;le of Mer&s;ey, which they made a &s;hew of attacking, to keep in the garri&s;on; mean while the re&s;t took a good number of cattle from the coun|try, which they brought &s;afe into the town, with five waggons loaden with corn: This was the la&s;t they could bring in that way, the lines being &s;oon fini&s;h|ed on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>This day the lord Fairfax &s;ent in a trumpet to the Earl of Norwich, and the lord Goring, offering honourable conditions to them all; allowing all the gentlemen their lives and arms, exemp|tion from plunder, and pa&s;&s;es, if they de&s;ired to go beyond &s;ea; and all the pri|vate men pardon, and leave to go peace|ably to their own dwellings; but the lord Goring, and the re&s;t of the gentle|men rejected it, and laughed at them: Upon which the lord Fairfax made pro|clamation, that his men &s;hould give the private &s;oldiers in Colche&s;ter free leave to pa&s;s through their camp, and go where they plea&s;ed without mole&s;tation, only leaving their arms, but that the gentle|men &s;hould have no quarter: This was a great lo&s;s to the Royali&s;ts, for now the men, fore&s;eeing the great hard&s;hips they were like to &s;uffer, began to &s;l$p away, and the lord Goring was obliged to for|bid any to de&s;ert on pain of pre&s;ent death, and to keep parties of hor&s;e continually patroling to prevent them; notwith|&s;tanding which many got away</P>
<P N="21">21. The town de&s;ired the lord Gore|ing to give them leave to &s;end a me&s;|&s;age to lord Fairfax, to de&s;ire they might have liberty to carry on their trade and &s;ell their Bays and Says, which lord Gor|ing granted; but the enemy's general returned, that they &s;hould have con&s;i|dered that before they let the rovali&s;ts into the town: That to de&s;ire a free trade from a town be&s;ieged, was never heard of or at lea&s;t, was &s;uch a motion, as was never yer granted: That howe|ver, he would give the Baymakers leave to bring their Bays and Says, and other goods, once a week, or oftener, if they de&s;ire it, to Lexden Heath, where they &s;hould have a free market, and might &s;ell them or carry them back again, if not &s;old, as they found occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="22">22. The be&s;ieged &s;ally'd out in the night with a &s;trong party, and di&s;tur$|ed the enemy in their works, and partly ruined one of their forts, called Ewer's &s;ort, where the be&s;iegers were laying a bridge over the river Coln. Al&s;o they &s;ally'd again at Ea&s;t-bridge, and faced the Suffolk troops, who were now de|clared enemies, the&s;e brought in &s;ix and fifty good bullocks, and &s;ome cows, and they took and killed &s;everal of the ene|my.</P>
<P N="23">23. The be&s;iegers began to fire with their cannon from E&s;&s;ex fort, and from Bark&s;ted's fort, which was built upon the Malden road, and finding that the be&s;ieged had a party in Sir Harbottle Grim&s;ton's hou&s;e, called, The Fryery, they fired at it with their cannon, and battered it almo&s;t down, and then the &s;oldiers &s;et it on fire.</P>
<P>This day, upon the town&s;men's treaty for the freedom of the Bay trade, the lord Fairfax &s;ent a &s;econd offer of condi|tions to the be&s;ieged, being the &s;ame as before, only excepting lord Goring, lord Capel, Sir George Li&s;le, and Sir Charles Lucas.</P>
<P>This day we had News in the town, that the Suffolk forces were advanced to a&s;&s;i&s;t the be&s;iegers, and that they began a fort called Fort Suffolk, on the North &s;ide of the town, to &s;hut up the Suffolk road towards Stratford This day the be&s;ieged &s;ally'd out at North-bridge, at|tacked the out guards of the Suffolk men on Mile-End Heath, and drove them in|to their &s;ort in the woods.</P>
<P>This day the lord Fairfax &s;ent a trum|pet, complaining of chew'd and poi&s;on'd bullets being &s;hot from the town, and
<PB REF="16" MS="Y">
threatning to give no quarter if that practice was allowed; but lord Goring returned an&s;wer, with a prote&s;tation, that no &s;uch thing was done by his or|der or con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="25">25. They fir'd hard from their cannon again&s;t St. Mary's &s;teeple, on which was planted a large calvery, which annoyed them even in the general's head quarters at Lexden. One of the be&s;t gunners the garri&s;on had&punc; was killed with a cannon bullet. This night the be&s;ieged &s;ally'd towards Audly, on the Suffolk road, and brought in &s;ome cattle.</P>
<P N="35">35. Lord Capell &s;ent a trumpet to the Parliament general, but the rogue ran away, and came not back, nor &s;ent any an&s;wer; whether they receiv'd his me&s;&s;age or not, was not known.</P>
<P N="26">26. This day having fini&s;h'd their new Bridge, a party of their Troops pa&s;s'd that Bridge, and took po&s;t on the hill over-again&s;t Mile-End Church, where they built a Fort, call'd Fothergall's Fort, and another on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Road, call'd Rainsbro's Fort &s;o that the town was entirely &s;hut in, on that &s;ide, and the Royali&s;ts had no place free but over Ea&s;t-Bridge, which was afterwards cut off by the enemy's bringing their line from the Hithe within the River to the &s;tone cau&s;e|way leading to the Ea&s;t bridge.</P>
<P>July 1. From the 26th ult. to the 1&s;t, the be&s;iegers continu'd fini&s;hing their works, and by the 2d the whole town was &s;hut in; at which the be&s;iegers gave a general Salvo from their Cannon at all their Forts, but the be&s;ieged gave them a return, for they &s;ally'd out in the night, attack'd Bark&s;tead's fort, &s;carce fini&s;h'd, with &s;uch fury, that they twice enter'd the work &s;word in hand, kill'd mo&s;t part of the defendant's, and &s;poil'd part of the &s;orts ca&s;t up; but fre&s;h forces coming up, they retir'd with little lo&s;s, bringing eight pri&s;|oners, and having &s;lain, as they reported, above 100.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd, lord Fairfax, offer'd exchange for Sir William Ma&s;ham in par|ticular, and afterwards for other pri&s;oners but the lord Goring refus'd.</P>
<P N="5">5. The be&s;ieged &s;ally'd with two Re|giments, &s;upported by &s;ome hor&s;e, at midnight; they were commanded by Sir George Li&s;le; they fell on with &s;uch fury, that the enemy were put into con|fu&s;ion, their works at Ea&s;t-Bridge ruin'd, and two pieces of cannon taken, Lieute|nant Col. Sambrook, and &s;everal other Officers, were kill'd, and our Men retir'd into the town, bringing the Captain, two Lieutenants, and about 50 men wi$h them pri&s;oners into the town, but having no hor&s;e, we could not bring off the cannon, but they &s;pik'd them, and made them unfit for &s;ervice.</P>
<P>From this time to the 11th, the be|&s;ieged, &s;ally'd almo&s;t every night, being encourag'd by their &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and they con&s;tantly cut off &s;ome of the Enemy, but not without lo&s;s al&s;o on their own &s;ide.</P>
<P>About this time we receiv'd by a &s;py, the bad news of defeating the King's friends almo&s;t in all parts of England, and particularly &s;everal parties which had good wi&s;hes to our gentlemen, and intended to relieve them.</P>
<P>Our Batteries from St. Mary's Fort and Steeple, and from the Narth-bridge, great|ly annoy'd them, and kill'd mo&s;t of their Gunners and Fire-men. One of the me&s;|&s;engers who brought news to lord Fairfax of the defeat of one of the Parties in Kent, and the taking of Weymer Ca&s;tle, &s;lip'd into the Town, and brought a letter to the lord Goring, and li&s;ted in the Reigiment of the lord Capel'&punc; hor&s;e.</P>
<P N="14">14. The be&s;iegers attack'd and took the Hithe Church, with a &s;mall work the be|&s;ieged had there, but the defenders retir'd in time; &s;ome were taken pri&s;oners in the church, but not in the fort: Sir Charles Lucas's hor&s;e was attack'd by a great bo|dy of the be&s;iegers; the be&s;ieged defend|ed them&s;elves with good re&s;olution for &s;ome time, but a hand-grenado thrown in by the a&s;&s;ailants, having fir'd the ma|gazine, the hou&s;e was blown up, and mo&s;t of the gallant defenders buried in the ruines. This was a great blow to the Royali&s;ts, for it was a very &s;trong pa&s;s, and always well guarded.</P>
<P N="15">15. The Lord Fairfax &s;ent offers of hon|ourable
<PB REF="17" MS="Y">
conditions to the &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on, if they would &s;urrender, or quit the &s;ervice; upon which the Lords Goring and Capel, and Sir Charles Lu|cas, returned an an&s;wer &s;igned by their hands, that it was not honourable or agreeable to the u&s;age of war, to offer conditions &s;eparately to the &s;oldiers, exclu&s;ive of their officers, and therefore civilly de&s;ir'd his Lord&s;hip to &s;end no more &s;uch me&s;&s;ages or propo&s;als, or if he did, that he would not take it ill if they hang'd up the me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>This evening all the gentlemen vo|luntiers, with all the Hor&s;e of the garri|&s;on, with Sir Charles Lucas, Sir Geo. Li&s;le, and Sir Bernard Ga&s;coign at the head of them, re&s;olved to break through the enemy, and foreing a pa&s;s to advance into Suffolk by Nayland Bridge; to this purpo&s;e, they pa&s;s'd the river near Mid|dle Mill; but their guides having mi&s;|lead them the enemy took the alarm; upon which their guides, and &s;ome pio|neers which they had with them, to open the Hedges, and level the banks, for their pa&s;&s;ing to Boxted, all run away; &s;o the Hou&s;e were obliged to retreat; the enemy pretended to pur&s;ue, but thinking they had retreated by the North Bridge, they mi&s;s'd them; upon which being enraged, they fir'd the &s;ub|urbs without the Bridge, and burn'd them quire down.</P>
<P N="18">18. Some of the Hor&s;e attempted to e&s;cape the &s;ame way; and had the whole body been there as before, they had effected it; but there being but two Troops, they were obliged to retire. Now the town began to be greatly di&s;tre&s;s'd, provi&s;ions &s;ailing; and the towns people, which were numerous, being very unea&s;y, and no way of break|ing through being found practicable, the gentlemen would have joined in any attempt wherein they might die gallantly with their &s;words in their hands, but nothing pre&s;ented, they often &s;ally'd and cut off many of the enemy, but their numbers were continually &s;up|plied, and the be&s;i$gsd dimini&s;hed; their Hor&s;e al&s;o &s;unk and became unfit for &s;er|vice, having very little Hay, and no Corn; and at length they were forced to kill them for food; &s;o that they began to be in a very mi&s;erable condition, and the &s;oldiers de&s;erted every day in great numbers, not being able to bear the want of food, as being almo&s;t &s;tarved with hunger.</P>
<P N="22">22. The Lord Fairfax offered a$ain an exchange of pri&s;oners, but the Lo d Goring rejected it, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed conditions to the chief gentlemen of the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>During this time, two Troops of the Royal Hor&s;e &s;allied out in the night, re&s;olving to break out or die: The fir&s;t rode up full gallop to the enemy's Hor&s;e-Guards on the &s;ide of Malden road, and exchanged their pi&s;tols with the advanced Troops, and wheeling, made as if they would retire to the town; but finding they were not immediately pur&s;ued, they wheeled about to the right and pa&s;&s;ing another guard at a di&s;tance, without being perfectly di&s;covered, they went clean off, and pa&s;&s;ing towards Tiptree Heath, and having good guides, they made their e&s;cape towards Cam|bridge&s;hire, in which length of way they way they found means to di&s;per&s;e wi h|out being attack d, and went every man his own way as fate directed; nor did we hear that many of them were taken; they were led, as we are informed, by Sir Bernard Ga&s;coigne.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e attempts of the Hor&s;e to break out, the enemy built a &s;mall Fort in the Meadow right again&s;t the Ford, in the river, at the middle Mill, and once &s;et that Mill on fire but it was extin|gui&s;hed without much damage; how|ever the Fort prevented any more attempts that way.</P>
<P N="22">22. The Parliament General &s;ent in a Trumpet, to propole again the exchange of pri&s;oners, offering the Lord Capel's &s;on for one, and Mr. A&s;hburnham, for Sir William Ma&s;ham; but the Ld. Capel, Ld. Goring, and the re&s;t of the loyal gen|tlemen rejected it; and Ld. Capel in parti|cular &s;ent the Ld. Fairfax word, it was in|human to &s;urprize his &s;on, who was not
<PB REF="18" MS="Y">
in arms, and offer him to in&s;ult a fa|ther's affection, but that he might mur|der his &s;on if he plea&s;ed, he would leave his blood to be revenged as Heaven &s;hould give opportunity; and the lord Goring &s;ent word, that as they had re|duced the King's &s;ervants to eat Hor&s;e|fle&s;h, the pri&s;oners &s;hould feed as they fed.</P>
<P>The enemy &s;ent again to complain of the Royali&s;ts &s;hooting poi&s;on'd bullets, and &s;ent two affidavits of it made by two de&s;erters, &s;wearing it was done by the lord Norwich's direction: The Ge|nerals in the town returned under all their hands, that they never gave any &s;uch command or direction; that they di&s;own'd the practice; and that the fel|lows who &s;wore it, were perjured before in running from their colours, and the &s;ervice of their King, and ought not to be credited again: But they added, that for &s;hoo ing rough-ca&s;t &s;lugs they mu&s;t excu&s;e them, as things &s;tood with them at that time.</P>
<P>About this time a porter in a &s;ol|dier's habit got through the enemy's leaguer, and pa&s;&s;ing their out-guards in the d rk, got into the town, and brought letters from London, a&s;&s;uring the Royal|i&s;ts, that there were &s;o many &s;trong par|ties up in arms for the King, and in &s;o many places, that they would be very &s;uddenly reliev'd: This they caus'd to be read to the &s;oldiers to encourage them; and particularly it relating to the ri&s;ing of the Earl of Holland, and the Duke of Buckingham, who with 500 Hor&s;e were got$en together in arms about $i$g&s;ton in Surrey; but we had notice i$ a few days after, that they were def$ated, and the Earl of Hol|land taken, who was afterwards be|he$ded.</P>
<P N="26">26. The enemy now began to batter the walls, and e&s;pecially on the We&s;t|&s;ide, from St. Mary's towards the North Ga$e; and we were a&s;&s;ured they intended a $o m; on which the Engineers were directed to make Trenches behind the walls where the breaches &s;hould be made, that in ca&s;e of a &s;torm, they might meet with a warm reception: Upon this, they gave over the de&s;ign of &s;torming. The Lord Goring finding that the enemy had &s;et the &s;uburbs on fire right again&s;t the Hithe ordered the remaining hou&s;es, which were empty of inhabitants, from whence their Mu&s;|keters fir'd again&s;t the town, to be burn'd al&s;o.</P>
<P N="31">31. A body of Foot &s;ally'd out at midnight, to di&s;cover what the enemy were doing at a place where they thought a new Fort was rai&s;ing; they fell in among the workmen, and put them to flight, cut in pieces &s;everal of the guard, and brought in the officer who command|ed them pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Aug. 2. The town was now in a mi&s;erable condition, the &s;oldiers &s;earched rifled the hou&s;es of the inhabitants for victuals; they had liv'd on Hor&s;e-fle&s;h &s;everal weeks, and mo&s;t of that al&s;o was lean as Carrion, which not being well &s;alted bred Wens; and this want of diet made the &s;oldiers &s;ickly, and many died of Fluxes, yet they boldly rejected all offers of &s;urrender, unle&s;s with &s;afety to their officers: However, &s;everal hundreds got out, and either pa&s;s'd the enemy's guards, or &s;urrender'd to them, and took pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Aug. 7. The town's people became very unea&s;y to the &s;oldiers, and the Mayor of the town, with the Alder|men, waited upon the General, de&s;i$ing leave to &s;end to the lord Fairfax, for leave to all the inhabitants to come out of the town, that they might not peri&s;h: to which the lord Goring con&s;ented; but the lord Fairfax refu&s;ed them.</P>
<P N="12">12. The Rabble got together in a va&s;t crowd about the lord Goring's quar|ters, clamouring for a &s;urrender, and they did this every evening, bringing women and children, who lay howling and crying on the ground for bread; the &s;oldiers beat off the $ len, but the women and children would not &s;tir, bidding the &s;oldiers kill them, &s;aying they had rather be &s;hot than be &s;tarv'd.</P>
<P N="16">16. The general moved by the cries and di&s;tre&s;s of the poor inhabitants, &s;ent
<PB REF="19" MS="Y">
out a trumpet to the Parliament general, demanding leave to &s;end to the prince, who was with a fleet of 19 men of war in the mouth of the Thames, offering to &s;urrender, if they were not relieved in 20 days. The lord Fairfax refu&s;ed it, and &s;ent them word, he would be in the Town in per&s;on, and vi&s;it them in le&s;s than 20 days, intimating that they were preparing for a &s;torm. Some tart me&s;&s;a|ges and an&s;wers were exchanged on this occa&s;ion. The lord Goring &s;ent word, they were willing, in compa&s;&s;ion to the poor town's people, and to &s;ave the ef|fu&s;ion of blood, to &s;urrender upon ho|nourable terms, but that as for the &s;torm|ing them, which was threatened, they might come on when they thought fit, for that they (the Royali&s;ts) were ready for them. This held to the 19th:</P>
<P N="20">20. The lord Fairfax returned, what he &s;aid, was his la&s;t an&s;wer, and &s;hould be the la&s;t offer of mercy: The condi|tions offered were, That upon a peace|able &s;urrender, all &s;oldiers and officers un|der the degree of a captain, in commi&s;|&s;ion, &s;hould have their lives, be exempt|ed from plunder, and have pa&s;&s;es to go to their re&s;pective dwellings: All the captains and &s;uperior officers, with all the lords and gentlemen, as well in com|mi&s;&s;ion as voluntiers, to &s;urrender pri&s;o|ners at di&s;cretion, only that they &s;hould not be plundered by the &s;oldiers.</P>
<P N="21">21. The generals rejected tho&s;e offers; and when the people came about them again for bread, &s;et open one of the gates, and bid them go out to the enemy, which a great many did willingly; up|on which the lord Goring ordered all the re&s;t that came about his door, to be turned out after them: But when the people came to the lord Fairfax's camp, the outguards were ordered to fire at them, and drive them all back again to the gate; which the lord Goring &s;eeing, he ordered them to be received in again. And now, although the generals and &s;oldiers al&s;o, were re&s;olute to die with their &s;words in their hands, rather than yield, and had maturely re&s;olved to a|bide a &s;torm; yet the mayor and alder|men having petitioned them, as well as the inhabitants, being wearied with the importunities of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people, and pitying the deplorable condition the were reduced to, they agreed to en|ter into a treaty, and accordingly, &s;ent out &s;ome officers to the lord Fairfax, they Parliament general, to treat; and with them was &s;ent two gentlemen of the pri|&s;oners, upon their parole to return.</P>
<P>Upon the return of the &s;aid me&s;&s;en|gers with the lord Fairfax's terms, the lord Goring, &amp;c. &s;ent out a letter, de|claring they would die with their &s;words in their hands, rather than yield with|out quarter for life, and &s;ent a paper of articles, on which they were willing to &s;urrender: But in the very intrim of this treaty, news came, that the Scots army under duke Hamilton, which was enter|ed into Lanca&s;hire, and was joined by the Royali&s;ts in that county, making 21,000 men, were entirely defeated. Af|ter this, the lord Fairfax would not grant any abatement of articles, viz. To have all, above Lieutenants, &s;urrender at mer|cy.</P>
<P>Upon this the lord Goring and the ge|neral refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit again, and pro|po&s;ed a general fally, and to break th$o' or die, but found, upon preparing for it, that the &s;oldiers, who had their lives offered them, declined it, &s;caring the gentlemen would e&s;cape, and they &s;hould be left to the mercy of the Par|liament &s;oldiers; and that upon this they began to muitny, and talk of &s;urrender|ing the town, and their officers too. Things being brought to this pa&s;s, the Lords and General laid a&s;ide that de&s;ign, and found them&s;elves oblig'd to &s;ubmit: And &s;o the town was &s;urrendred the 28th of Augu&s;t, 1648, upon condition, as follows:</P>
<P>The Lords and Gentlemen all pri&s;on|ers at mercy.</P>
<P>The common &s;oldiers had pa&s;&s;es to go home to their &s;everal dwell|ings, but without arms, and an oath not to &s;erve again&s;t the Parliament.</P>
<P><PB REF="20" MS="Y">
The town to be pre&s;erv'd from pil|lage, paying 14000 l. ready money.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, a council of war being called about the pri&s;oners of war, it was re&s;olved, That the lords &s;hould be left to the di&s;po&s;al of the Parliament. That Sir Charles Lucas, Sir George Li&s;le, and Sir Marm$duke Ga&s;$oign, &s;hould be &s;hot to death, and the other officers pri&s;oners, to remain in cu&s;tody till farther order.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t of the three gentlemen were &s;hot to death, and the third re|&s;pited.</P>

<P>The town of Colche&s;ter has been &s;up|po&s;ed to contain about 40,000 people, including the out-villages which are within its liberty, of which there are a great many, the liberty of the town be|ing of a great extent: One &s;ad te&s;timo|ny of the town being &s;o populous is, that they bury'd upwards of 5259&punc; peo|ple in the Plague year, 1665. But the town was &s;everely vi&s;ited indeed, ever more in proportion than any of its neigh|bours, or than the city of London.</P>
<P>The government of the town is by a Mayor, high Steward, a Recorder, or his deputy, eleven Aldermen, a Chamber|lain, a town-clerk, a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and eigh|teen common council men. Their high|&s;teward (this yea, 1722.) is Sir I&s;aac Rebow, a gentleman of a good family and known character, who has general|ly, for above 30 years, been one of their repre&s;entatives in Parliament: He has a very good hou&s;e at the entrance in at the South, or head gate of the town, where he has had the honour, &s;everal times to lodge and entertain the late king William, of glorious memory, in his return|ing from Holland, by way of Harwich, to London. Their recorder is Ea$l Cow|per, who has been twice lord high cha$|cellor of England: But his lord&s;hip n$$ re&s;iding in tho&s;e parts, has put in his deputy,&mdash;Price, E&s;q; barri&s;ter at Law, and who dwells in the town. There are in Colche&s;ter eight churches, be&s;ides tho&s;e which are damaged, and five meeting-hou&s;es, whereof two for Q$$|kers; be&s;ides a Dutch church, and a French church.</P>

<P N="1">1. Bay-Hall, an ancient &s;ociety kept up for a&s;certaining the manufactures of Bays; which a e, or ought to be, all brought to this hall, to be viewed and &s;ealed according to their goodne&s;s, by the ma&s;ters; and to this practice has been owing the great reputation of the Colche&s;ter Bays in foreign marke$s; where to open the &s;ide of a bale and &s;how the &s;eal, has been enough to give the buyer a character of the value a&s; the goods, without any farther &s;earch; and &s;o far as they abate the integrity and exactne&s;s of their method, which, I am told, o$ late is much omitted; I &s;ay, &s;o far, that reputation will certainly abate in the markets they go to, which are princi|pally in Portugal and Italy. This cor|poration is governed by a particular fe$ of men, who are called Governors of the

The Work-hou&s;e, being lately en|larg'd, and $o which belongs a Corpo a|tion, or Body of inhabitants, con&s;i&s;ting of Sixty Per&s;ons incorporated by Act of Parliament Anno 1698, for taking Care of the Poor: They are incorporated by the Name and Title of The Gover or, Deputy Governor, A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and Guardi|ans, of the Poor of the Town of Col he&s;ter. They are in Number Eight and Forty; to whom are added the Mayor and Aldermen for the time being who are always Guar|dians by the &s;ame Charter: The&s;e make the Number of Sixty, as above.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a Grammar Free-School, with a good Allowance to the Ma&s;ter, who is cho&s;en by the Town.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Ca&s;tle of Colche&s;ter is now be|come only a Monument &s;hewing the An|tiquity of the Place, it being built as the Walls of the Town al&s;o are, with Roman Bricks; and the Roman Coins dug up here, and ploughed up in the Fields ad|joining, confirm it. The Inhabitants boa&s;t much, that Helena, the Mother of Con&s;tantine the Great, fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Em|peror of the Romans, was born there; and it may be &s;o for ought we know; I only ob&s;erve what Mr. Camden &s;ays of the Ca&s;tle of Colche&s;ter, viz.</P>
<P>In the middle of this City &s;tands a Ca|&s;tle ready to fall with Age.</P>
<P>Tho' this Ca&s;tle has &s;tood an hundred and twenty Years from the Time Mr. Camden wrote that Account, and it is not fallen yet; nor will another hundred and twenty Years, I believe, make it look one jot the older: And it was ob|&s;ervable, that in the late &s;iege of this Town, a common Shot, which the be|&s;iegers made at this old Ca&s;tle, were &s;o far from making it fall, that they made little or no Impre&s;&s;ion upon it; for which Rea&s;on, it &s;eems, and becau&s;e the Garri|&s;on made no great u&s;e of it again&s;t the be&s;iegers, they fir'd no more at it.</P>
<P>There are two Charity Schools &s;et up here, and carried on by a generous Sub&s;cription, with very good Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The Title of Colche&s;ter is in the Fami|ly of the Earl ivers; and the elde&s;t Son of that Family, is called Lord Colche&s;ter; tho', as I under&s;tand, the Title is not &s;ettled by the Creation, to the elde&s;t Son, till he enjoys the Title of Earl with it; but that the other is by the Courte&s;y of England; however this I take <HI>ad re|ferendum.</HI></P>
<P>From Colche&s;ter, I took another &s;tep do n to the coa&s;t, the Land running out a g eat way into he Sea, South, and S. E. makes that Promontory of Land called the Na&s;e, and well known to Seamen, u&s;ing the Northern Trade. Here one &s;ees a Sea open as an Ocean, without any oppo&s;ite &s;hore, tho' it be no more than the Mouth of the Thames. This Point call'd the Na&s;e, and the N. F. Point of Kent, near Margate, call'd the North Foreland, making (what they call) the mouth of the River, and the Port of London, tho' it be here above 60 Miles over.</P>
<P>At Walton, under the Na&s;e, they find on the Shoar, Copperas-Stone in great Quantities; and there are &s;everal $$ge Work, call'd Copperas Hou&s;es, where they make it with great expence.</P>
<P>On this Promonto$y is a new Mark, erected by the Trinity-Hou&s;e Men, and at the Publick Expence, being a round Brick Tower, near 80 Foot high. The Sea gains &s;o much upon the Land here, by the continual Winds at S. W. that within the memory of &s;ome of the Inha|bitants there&punc; they have lo&s;t above 30 Acres of Land in one Place</P>
<P>From hence we go back into the County about four Miles, becau&s;e of the Creeks which lie between; and then turning Ea&s;t again, come to Harwich, on the utmo&s;t Ea&s;tern Point of this large coun|try.</P>
<P>Harwich is a Town &s;o well known, and &s;o perfectly de&s;crib'd by many Writers, I need &s;ay little of it: 'Tis &s;trong by Situation, and may be made more &s;o
<PB REF="22" MS="Y">
by Art. But 'tis many Years &s;ince the Government of England have had any occa&s;ion to fortify Towns to the Land|ward, 'tis enough that the Harbour or Road, which is one of the be&s;t and &s;ecu|re&s;t in England, is cover'd at the Entrance by a &s;trong Fort, and a Battery of Guns to the Seaward, ju&s;t as at Tilbury, and which &s;ufficiently defend the Mouth of the River: And there is a particular Felicity in this Fortification, viz. That tho' the Entrance or Opening of the River into Sea, is very wide, e&s;pecially at High-wa|ter, at lea&s;t two Miles, if not three over; yet the Channel which is deep, and in which the Ships mu&s;t keep and come to the Harbour is narrow, and lies only on the &s;ide of the Fort; &s;o that all the Ships which come in, or go out, mu&s;t come clo&s;e under the Guns of the Fort; that is to &s;ay, under the command of their Shot.</P>
<P>The Fort is on the Suffolk &s;ide of the Bay, or Entrance, but &s;tands &s;o far into the Sea upon the Point of a Sand or Shoal, which runs out toward the E&s;&s;ex-&s;ide, as it were, laps over the Mouth of that Ha|ven like a Blind to it; and our Surveyors of the country affirm it to be in the Coun|ty of E&s;&s;ex. The making this Place, which was formerly no other than a Sand in the Sea, &s;olid enough for the Foundation of &s;o good a Fortification, has not been done but by many Years Labour, often Repairs, and an infinite Expence of Mo|ney, but 'tis now &s;o firm, that nothing of &s;torms and high Tides, or &s;uch Things, as make the Sea dangerous to the&s;e kind of Works, can effect it.</P>
<P>The Harbour is of a va&s;t Extent; for, as two Rivers empty them&s;elves here, viz. S$ou$ from Maningtree, and the Orwel from Ip&s;wich; the Channels of both are large and deep, and &s;afe for all weathers; to where they joyn they make a large Bay or Road, able to receive the bigge&s;t Ships, and the greate&s;t Number that ever the World &s;aw together; I mean Ships of War. In the old Dutch War, great U&s;e has been made of this Harbour; and I have known that there has been 100 Sail of Men of War and their Attendants, and between three and four hundred Sail of Collier Ships, all in this Harbour at a time and yet none of them crowding, or riding in danger of one another.</P>
<P>Harwich is known for being the Port where the Packet-Boats, between England and Holland, go out and come in: The in|habitants are far from being fam'd for good U&s;age to Strangers, but on the contrary, are blamed for being extravagant in their Reckonings, in the Publick Hou&s;es, which has not a little encourag'd the &s;etting $word$ of Sloops, which they now call Pa&s;&s;age-Boats, to Holland, to go directly $word$ the River of Thames; this, 'tho it may be &s;omething the longer pa&s;&s;age, yet a$ they are &s;aid to be more obliging to Pa&s;&s;engers, and more rea&s;onable in the Expence, and as &s;ome &s;ay al&s;o the Ve&s;&s;els are better Sea Boats, has been the Rea|&s;on why &s;o many Pa&s;&s;engers do not $span$ come by the way of Harwich, as $word$ were wont to do; in&s;omuch, that the Stage Coaches; between this Place and London, which ordinarily went twice o$ three times a Week, are now entirely laid down, and the Pa&s;&s;engers are left to hire Coaches on purpo&s;e, take Po&s;t-Hor&s;es or hire Hor&s;es to Colche&s;ter, as they find mo&s;t convenient.</P>
<P>The account of a petrifying quality $word$ the Earth here, tho' &s;ome will have it to $word$ in the Water of a Spring hard $span$ very &s;trange: They boa&s;t that their $word$ is Wall'd, and their Streets pav'd with Clay, and yet, that one is as &s;trong, and the other as clean as tho&s;e that are built or pav'd with Stone: The Fact is indeed true for there is a &s;ort of Clay in the Cliff, be|tween the Town and the Beacon-Hill ad|joining, which when it falls down into the Sea, where is is beaten with the Waves and the Weather, turns gradually into Stone: But the chief Rea&s;on $word$ is from the Water of a certain Spring or Well, which ri&s;ing in the &s;aid Cliff, $uns down into the Sea among tho&s;e pieces of Clay, and petrifies them as it runs; and the Force of the Sea often &s;tirring, and perhaps, turning the lumps of Clay, when &s;torms of Wind may give force enough to the Water, cau&s;es them to $word$ every where alike; tho&s;e that were not
<PB REF="23" MS="Y">
quite &s;unk in the Water of the Spring would be petrify'd but in part. The&s;e Stones are gathered up to pave the Streets, and build the Hou&s;es, and are indeed very hard: 'Tis al&s;o remarkable, that &s;ome of them taken up before they are thoroughly petrify'd, will, upon breaking them, appear to be hard as a Stone without, and &s;oft as Clay in the Middle; whereas others, that have lain a due Time, &s;hall be thorough Stone to the Center, and as exceeding hard with|in as without: The &s;ame Spring is &s;aid to turn Wood into Iron: But this I take to be no more or le&s;s than the Quality which, as I mentioned of the Shoar at the Ne$s, is found to be in much of the Stone, all along this Soar, (viz.) of the Copperas kind, and 'tis certain, that the Copperas Stone (&s;o called&punc; is found in all that Cliff, and even where the Water of this Spring has run; and I pre&s;ume, that tho&s;e, who call the harden'd Pieces of wood, which they take out of this Well by the Name of Iron, never try'd the Quality of it with the Fire or Ham|mer; if they had, perhaps they would have given &s;ome other Account of it.</P>
<P>On the Promontory of Land&punc; which they call Beacon-Hill, and which lies beyond, or behind the Town, towards the Sea, there is a Light-Hou&s;e, to give the Ships Directions in their &s;ailing by, as well as their coming into the Harbour in the Night. I &s;hall take Notice of the&s;e again all together, when I come to &s;peak of the Society of Trinity-Hou&s;e, as they are called, by whom they are all directed upon this Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>This Town was erected into a Mar|qui$ate, in Honour of the truly glorious Family of Schomberg, the elde&s;t Son of Duke Schomberg, who landed with King William 3d, being &s;tiled Marquis of Har|wich; but that Family (in England at lea&s;t) being extinct, the $itle dies al&s;o.</P>
<P>Harwich is a Town of Hurry and Bu&s;ine&s;s, not much of Gaiety and Plea|&s;ure; yet the Inhabitants &s;eem warm in their Ne&s;ts, and &s;ome of them are very Wealthy: There are not many (if any) Gentlemen, or Families of Note, either in the Town, or very near it. They &s;end two Members to Parliament; the pre&s;ent are, Sir Peter Parker, and Hum|phrey Par&s;ons, E&s;q;</P>
<P>And now, being at the Extremity of the County of E&s;&s;ex, of which I have given you &s;ome View, as to that &s;ide next the Sea only; I &s;hall break off this Part, by telling you that I will take the Towns which lie more towards the Cen|ter of the County, in my Return by the North and We&s;t Part only, that I may give you a few Hints of &s;ome Town; which were near me in my Rout this way, and of which being &s;o well known, there is but little to &s;ay.</P>
<P>On the Road from London to Colche&s;|ter, before I came into it at Witham, lie four good Market Towns at equal Di|&s;tance from one another; namely, Rum|ford, noted for two Markets, viz. one for Calves and Hogs, the other for Corn and other Provi&s;ions; mo&s;t, if not all, bought up for London Market. At the farther End of the Town, in the middle of a &s;tately Park &s;tood Guldy Hall, vul|garly Giddy Hall, an ancient Seat of one Coke, &s;ome Time Lord Mayor of Lon|don, but $orfeited on &s;ome Occa&s;ion, to the Crown: It is &s;ince pulled down to the Ground, and there now &s;tands a no|ble &s;tately Fabrick, or Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, built upon the Spot by Sir John Eyles, a wealthy Merchant of London, and cho&s;en Sub Governor of the South Sea Company, immediately after the Ruin of the former Sub Governor and Direc|tors, who&s;e Overthrow makes the Hi&s;to|ry of tho&s;e Times famous.</P>
<P>Brent-Wood and Ingar&s;tone, and even Chelmsford it&s;elf, have very little to be &s;aid of them, but that they are large thorough-$air Towns, full of good Inns, and chiefly maintained by the exce&s;&s;ive Multitude of Carriers and Pa&s;&s;engers, which are con&s;tantly pa&s;&s;ing this way to London, with Droves of Cattle, Pro|vi&s;ions, and Manufactures for London.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the&s;e Towns is indeed the County Town, where the County Jail is kept, and where the A&s;&s;ize$ are very often held; it &s;tands on the Conflux
<PB REF="24" MS="Y">
of two Rivers, the Chelmer, whence the Town is called and the Cann.</P>
<P>At Lees, or Lee's Priory, as &s;ome call it, is to be &s;een an ancient Hou&s;e, in the middle of a beautiful Park, formerly the Seat of the late Duke of Manche&s;ter, but &s;ince the death of the Duke, it is &s;old to the Duche&s;s Dowager of Bucking|ham&s;hire; the pre&s;ent Duke of Manche|&s;ter, retiring to his ancient Family Seat at Kimbolton in Huntingdon&s;hire, it be|ing a much finer Re&s;idence. His Grace is lately married to a Daughter of the Duke of Montagu, by a Branch of the Hou&s;e of Ma$lborough</P>
<P>Four Market Towns fill up the re&s;t of this Part of the Country; Dunmow, Braintree, Thaxted, and Cogg$hall; all noted for the Manufacture of Bays, as above, and for very little el&s;e, except I &s;hall make the Ladies laugh, at the fa|mous old Story of the Flitch of Bacon at Dunmow, which is this:</P>
<P>One Robert Fitz Walter, a powerful Baron in this County, in the Time of Henry III. on &s;ome merry Occa&s;ion, which is not pre&s;erved in the re&s;t of the Story, in&s;tituted a Cu&s;tom in the Priory here: <Q>&startq;That whatever married Man did not Repent of his being marry'd, or Quarrel, or Differ or Di&s;pute with his Wife within a Year and a Day after his Marriage, and would Swear to the Truth of it, kneeling upon two hard pointed Stones in the Church Yard, which Stones he cau&s;ed to be &s;et up in the Priory Church Yard, for that Purpo&s;e. The Prior and Convent, and as many of the Town as would, to be pre&s;ent, &s;uch Per&s;on &s;hould have a Flitch of Bacon.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I do not remember to have read, that any one ever came to demand it; nor do the People of the Place pretend to &s;ay, of their own Knowledge, that they remember any that did &s;o; a long Time ago &s;everal did demand it, as they &s;ay, but they know not who; neither is there any Record of it; nor do they tell us, if it were now to be demanded, who is obliged to deliver the Flitch of Bacon, the Priory being di&s;&s;olved and gone.</P>
<P>The Fore&s;t of Epping and Henalt, &s;preads a great Part of this Country &s;till: I &s;hall &s;peak again of the former in my return from this Circuit Former|ly ('tis thought) the&s;e two Fore&s;ts took up all the We&s;t and South Part of the County; but particularly we are a&s;&s;ured, that it reach'd to the River Chelmer, and into Dengy Hundred; and from thence again We&s;t to Epping and Wal|tham, where it continues to be a Fore&s;t &s;till.</P>
<P>Probably this Fore&s;t of Epping has been a Wild, or Fore&s;t, ever &s;ince this I&s;land was inhabited, and may &s;hew us, in &s;ome Parts of it, where Enclo&s;ures and Tillage has not broken in upon it, what the Face of this I&s;land was befo e the Romans Time; that is to &s;ay, before their landing in Britain.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution of this Fore&s;t is be&s;t &s;een, I mean as to the Antiquity of it, by the merry Grant of it from Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, before the Norman Con|que&s;t, to Randolph Peperking, one of his Favourites, who was after called $ e|verell, and who&s;e Name remains &s;till in &s;everal Villages in this County; as par|ticularly that of Hatfield Pevereli, in the Road from Chelmsford to Witham, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be originally a Park, which they called a Field in tho&s;e Days&punc; and Hartfield may be as much as to &s;ay a Park for Deer; for the Stags were in tho&s;e Days called Harts; &s;o that this was neither more nor le&s;s than Randolph Pe|perking's Hartfield; that is to &s;ay, Ralph Peverell's Deer-Park.</P>
<P>N B. This Ralp Randolph, or Ralph Peverell, (call him as you plea&s;e) had, it &s;eems, a mo&s;t beautiful Lady to his Wife, who was Daughter of Ingelrick, one of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or's Noble|men: He had two Sons by her, William Peverell, a fam'd Soldier, and Lord or Governor of Dover-Ca&s;tle; which he &s;urrendered to William the Conqueror, after the Battle in Su&s;&s;ex: and Pain Pe|verell, his younge&s;t, who was Lord of Cambridge: When the elde&s;t Son deli|vered up the Ca&s;tle, the Lady his Mo|ther, above-named, who was the cele|brated
<PB REF="25" MS="Y">
Beauty of the Age, was it &s;eems there; and the Conqueror fell in Love with her, and whether by Force, or by Con&s;ent, took her away, and &s;he became his Mi&s;tre&s;s, or what el&s;e you plea&s;e to call it: By her he had a Son, who was call'd William, after the Conqueror's Chri&s;tian Name, but retain'd the Name of Peverell, and was afterwatds created by the Conqueror, Lord of Nottingham.</P>
<P>This lady afterwards, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, by way of Penance, for her yielding to the Conqueror, founded a Nunnery at the Village of Hatfield-Peverel, men|tioned above, and there &s;he lies buried in the Chapel of it, which is now the Pari&s;h Church, where her Memory is pre&s;erv'd by a Tomb-&s;tone under one of the windows.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;everal Towns, where any ancient Parks have been plac'd, call'd by the Name of Hatfield on that very Account.</P>
<P>As Hatfield Broad Oak in this County, Bi&s;hop's Hatfield in He$tford&s;hire, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>But I return to King Edward's merry Way, as I call it, of granting this Fore&s;t to this Ralph Peperking, which I find in the ancient Records, in the very Words it was pa&s;s'd in, as follows: Take my Explanations with it, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e that are not us'd ro the ancient Engli&s;h.</P>

There are many Gentlemen's Seats on this &s;ide the Country, and a great A&s;&s;em|bly &s;et up at New Hall, near this Town much re&s;orted to by the Neighbouring Gentry. I &s;hall next proceed to the Coun|ty of Suffolk, as my fir&s;t de&s;ign directed me to do.</P>
<P>From Harwich therefore, having a mind to view the Harbour, I &s;ent my Hor&s;es round by Maningtree, where there is a Timber Bridge over the Stour called Ca|taway-Bridge, and took a Boat up the Ri|ver O$well for Ip&s;wich: A Traveller will hardly under&s;tand me, e&s;pecially a Seaman, when I &s;peak of the River Stour and the River Orwell at Harwich, for they know them by no other Names than tho&s;e of Maningtree-Water, and Ip&s;wich-Water; &s;o while I am on &s;alt Water, I mu&s;t &s;peak as ho&s;e who u&s;e the Sea may under&s;tand me, and when I am up in the Country among the In-land Towns again, I &s;hall call them out of their Names no more.</P>
<P>It is twelve Miles from Harwich up the Water to Ip&s;wich: Before I come to the Town, I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething of it, becau&s;e &s;peaking of the River requires it: In for|mer times, that is to &s;ay &s;ince the Writer of this remembers the Place very well, and particularly ju&s;t before the late Dutch Wars, Ip&s;wich was a Town of very good Bu&s;ine&s;s; particulary it was the greate&s;t Town in England for large Colli$rs or Coal-&s;hips, employed between New Ca|&s;tle and London: Al&s;o they built the big|ge&s;t Ships and the be&s;t, for the &s;aid fetch|ing of Coals of any that were employ'd in that Trade: They built al&s;o there &s;o pro|digious &s;trong, that it was an ordinary thing for an Ip&s;wich Collier, if no Di&s;a&s;ter happen'd to him, to reign (as Seamen call it) forty or fifty Years, and more.</P>
<P>In the Town of Ip&s;wich the Ma&s;ters of the&s;e Ships generally dwelt, and there were, as they then told me, above a hun|dred Sail of them, belonging to the Town at one time, the lea&s;t of which carried Fif|teen-&s;core, as they compu e it, that is, 300 Chaldron of Coals; this was about the Year 1668 (when I fir&s;t knew the Place) This made the Town be at that time &s;o populous, for tho&s;e Ma&s;ters, as they had good Ships at Sea, &s;o they had large Fa|milies, who liv'd plentifully, and in very good Hou&s;es in the Town, and &s;everal Streets were chiefly Inhabited by &s;uch.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s o$ decay of this Trade, ac|counts for the pre&s;ent pretended decay of the Town of Ip&s;wich, of which I &s;hall &s;peak more pre&s;ently: The Ships wore out, the Ma&s;ters died off, the Trade took a new Turn, Dutch Flyboats taken in the War, and made free Ships by Act of Par|liament, th$u&s;t them&s;elves into the Coal-Trade for the Intere&s;t of the Captors, &s;uch as the Yarmouth and London Merchants, and others; and the Ip&s;wich Men dropt gradually out of it&punc; being di&s;couraged by tho&s;e Dutch Flyboats: The&s;e Dutch Ve&s;|&s;els which co&s;t nothing but the Caption, were bought cheap, carried great Bur|thens, and the Ip&s;wich building fell off for want of Price, and &s;o the Trade de|cay'd, and the Town with it, I believe this will be own'd for the true beginning of their decay, if I mu&s;t allow it to be call'd a decay.</P>
<P>But to return to my Pa&s;&s;age up the Ri|ver. In the Winter-time tho&s;e great Col|lier-Ships, abovemention'd, are always laid up, as they call it: This is to &s;ay, the Coal Trade abates at London, the Citizens are generally furni&s;h'd, their Stores taken in, and the Demand is over; &s;o that the great Ships, the Northern Seas and Coa&s;t being al&s;o dangerous, the Nights long, and the Voyage hazardous, go to Sea no more, but lie by, the Ships are unrigg'd, the Sails, &amp;c. carry,d a Shore, the Top-Ma&s;ts &s;truck, and they ride Moor'd in the River, under the ad|vantages and &s;ecurity of found Ground, and a high Woody Shore, where they lie as &s;afe as in a wet Dock; and it was a very agreeable &s;ight to &s;ee, perhaps two Hun|dred Sail of Ships&punc; of all &s;izes lie in that Po&s;ture every Winter: All this while, which was u&s;ually from Michelmas to La|dy Day, The Ma&s;ters liv'd calm and &s;e|cure with their Families in Ip&s;wich; and enjoying plentifully, what in the Summer they got laboriou&s;ly at Sea, and this made the Town of Ip&s;wich very Populous in the Winter; for as the Ma&s;ters&punc; &s;o mo&s;t of the Men, e&s;pecially their Mates, Boat&s;wains, Carpenters, &amp;c. were of the &s;ame Place, and liv d in their Proportions, ju&s;t as the Ma&s;ters did: &s;o that in the $word$ $word$
<PB REF="27" MS="Y">
might be perhaps a Thou&s;and Men in the Town more than in the Summer, and perhaps a gretter Number.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tify what I advance here, that this Town was formerly very full of Peo|ple, I ask leave to refer to the Account of Mr. Camden. and what it was in his Time, his Wo d$ are the&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Ip&s;wich has a commodious Harbour, has been fortified with a Ditch and Rampart, has a great Trade, and is very Populous; being adorned with 14 Churches, and large private Buildings.</Q></P>
<P>This confirms what I have mentioned of the former State of this Town; but the pre&s;ent State is my proper Work; I there|fore return to my Voyage up the River.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of the&s;e &s;hips thus laid up in the River, as I have &s;aid, was very agree|able to me in my Pa&s;&s;age from Harwich, about 35 Years before the pre&s;ent Jour|ney; and it was in its Proportion equal|ly Melancholy to hear, that there were now &s;earce 40 Sail of good Colliers that belonged to the whole Town</P>
<P>In a creek in this River, call'd Laving|ton-creek, we &s;aw at low Water, &s;uch Shoals, or Hills rather, of Mu&s;cles, that great Boats might have loaded with them, and no mi&s;s have been made of them. Near this creek Sir Samuel Barnadi&s;ton had a very fine Seat as al&s;o a Decoy for wild Ducks and a very noble E&s;tate; but it is divided into many Branches &s;ince the death of the ancient Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; but I pro|ceed to the Town, which is the fir&s;t in the County of Suffolk of any note this Way.</P>
<P>Ip&s;wich is &s;eated, at the di&s;tance of 12 Miles from Harwich, upon the edge of the River, which taking a &s;hort turn to the We&s;t, the Town forms, there, a kind of Semi circle, or half Moon upon the Bank of the River: It is very remarka|ble, that tho' Ships of 500 Tun may, up|on a Spring Tide, come up very near this Town, and many Ships of that Burthen have been built there; yet the River is not Navigable any farther than the Town it&s;elf, or but very little; no not for the &s;malle&s;t Boats, nor does the Tide which ri&s;es &s;ometimes 13 or 14 Foot, and gives them 24 foot Water very near the Town, flow much farther up the River than the Town, or not &s;o much as to make it worth &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>He took little notice of the Town, or at lea&s;t of that part of Ip&s;wich, who pub|li&s;hed in his wild Ob&s;ervations on it, that Ships of 200 Tun are built there: I affirm, that I have &s;een a &s;hip of 400 Tun launch d at the Building-yard, clo&s;e to the Town, and I appeal to the Ip&s;wich Colliers (tho&s;e few that remain) belonging to this Town&punc; if &s;everal of them carrying 17 &s;core of Coals, which mu&s;t be upward of 400 Tun, have not formerly been built here; but &s;uperficial Ob&s;ervers mu&s;t be &s;uperfi|cial Writers, if they write at all; and to this Day, at John's Ne&s;s, within a Mile and half of the Town it&s;elf, Ships of a|ny Burthen may be built and launched, even at neap Tides.</P>
<P>I am much mi&s;taken too, if &s;ince the Revolution, &s;ome very good &s;hips have not been built at this Town, and particu|larly the Melford or M$lford-gally, a &s;hip of 40 Guns; as the Greyhound Frigate, a Man of War of 36 to 40 Guns, was at John's Ne&s;s. But what is this toward's le&s;&s;ening the Town of Ip&s;wich, any more than it would be to &s;ay, they do not build Men of War or Ea&s;t-Indi $ &s;hips, or &s;hips of 500 Tun Burthen at St. Catherines, or at Battle-Bridge in the Thames, when we know that a Mile or two lower, viz. at Rateliffe, Limehou&s;e, or Deptford, they build Ships of 1000 Ton, and might build fir&s;t rate Men of War too, if there was occa&s;ion; and the like might be done in this River of Ip&s;wich, within about two or three Miles of the Town; &s;o that it would not be at all an out of the way &s;peaking to &s;ay, &s;uch a &s;hip was built at Ip&s;wich, any more than it is to &s;ay, as they do, that the Royal Prince, the great Ship lately built for the South-Sea Com|pany, was London built, becau&s;e &s;he was built at Limehou&s;e.</P>
<P>And why then is not Ip&s;wich capable of building and receiving the greate&s;t Ships in the Navy, &s;eeing they may be built and brought up again Loaden, with|in a Mile and half of the Town?</P>
<P><PB REF="28" MS="Y">
But the neighbourhood of London, which &s;ucks the Vitals of Trade in this I&s;land to it&s;elf, is the chief Rea&s;on of a|ny decay of Bu&s;ine&s;s in this Place; and I &s;hall in the cour&s;e of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, hint at it, where many good Sea-Ports, and large Towns, tho' farther off than Ip&s;wich, and as well fitted for Com|merce, are yet &s;wallow'd up by the im|men&s;e Indra$t of Trade to the City of London; and more decay'd beyond all Compari&s;on, than Ip&s;wich is &s;uppo&s;ed to be; as Southampton, Weymouth, Dartmouth, and &s;everal others which I &s;hall &s;peak to in their Order: And if it be otherwi&s;e at this Time, with &s;ome other Towns, which are lately encreas'd in Trade and Navigation, Wealth, and People, while their Neighbours decay, it is becau&s;e they have &s;ome particular Trade, or accident to Trade, which is a kind of <HI>No&s;trum</HI> to them, in&s;eparable to the Place, and which fixes there by the Nature of the Thing; as the Her|ring-Fi&s;hery to Yarmouth; the Coal-Trade to New-Ca&s;tle; the Leeds Cloath|ing-Trade; the export of Butter and Lead, and the great Corn-Trade for Hol|land, is to Hull; the Virginia and We&s;t India Trade at Liverpool; the Iri&s;h Trade at Bri&s;tol, and the like: Thus the War has brought a flux of Bu&s;ine&s;s and People, and con&s;equently of Wealth, to &s;everal Places, as well as to Port&s;mouth, Chatham, Plymouth, Falmouth, and o|thers; and were any Wars like tho&s;e, to continue 20 Years with the Dutch, or any Nation who&s;e Fleets lay that way, as the Dutch do, it would be the like, perhaps, at Ip&s;wich in a few Years, and at other Places on the &s;ame Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>But at this pre&s;ent Time an Occa&s;ion offeers to &s;peak in favour of this Port; namely, the Greenland Fi&s;hery, lately propo&s;ed to be carry'd on by the South-Sea Company: On which Account I may freely advance this, without any Compliment to to the Town of Ip&s;wich, no Place in Britain&punc; is equally quallified like Ip&s;wich&punc; whether we re&s;pect the Cheapne&s;s of building and fitting out their Ships and Shalloups; al&s;o furni&s;h|ing, victualling and providing them with all kind of Stores; convenience for laying up the Ships after the Voyage; room for erecting their Magazines, Ware Hou&s;es, Rope-Walks, Cooperages, &amp;c. on the ea&s;ie&s;t Terms; and e&s;pecial|ly for the noi&s;ome Cookery, which at|tends the boiling their Blubber, which may be on this River (as it ought to be) remote from any Places of re&s;ort; then their nearne&s;s to the Market for the Oil when 'tis made; and which a|bove all, ought to be the chief thing con&s;idered in that Trade, the ea&s;ine&s;s of their putting out to Sea when they be|gin their Voyage, in which the &s;ame Wind that carries them from the Mouth of the Haven, is fair to the very Seas of Greenland.</P>
<P>I could &s;ay much more to this Point, if it were needful, and in few Words could ea&s;ily prove, that Ip&s;wich mu&s;t have the preference of all the Port-Towns of Britain, for being the be&s;t Center of the Greenland Trade, if ever that Trade fall into the Management of &s;uch a People as perfectly under&s;tand, and have a due hone&s;t regard to its be|ing managed with the be&s;t Husbandry, and to the Pro&s;perity of the Undertak|ing in general: But whether, we &s;hall e|ver arrive at &s;o happy a Time, as to re|cover &s;o u&s;eful a Trade to our Country, which our Ance&s;tors had the Honour to be the fir&s;t Undertakers of, and which has been lo&s;t only thro' the Indolence of others, and the encrea&s;ing Vigilance of our Neighbours, that is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s here to di&s;pute.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid, is only to let the World &s;ee, what improvement this Town and Port is capable of: I cannot think, but that providence, which made nothing in vain, cannot have re&s;erv'd &s;o u&s;eful, &s;o convenient a Port to lie vacant in the World; but that the Time will &s;ome time or other come (e&s;pecially con&s;ider|ing the improving Temper of the pre|&s;ent Age) when &s;ome peculiar beneficial Bu&s;ine&s;s may be found out, to make the Port of Ip&s;wich as u&s;eful to the $word$ and the Town as flouri&s;hing, as $word$
<PB REF="29">
ture has made it proper and capable to be.</P>
<P>As for the Town, it is true, it is but Thinly inhabited, in compari&s;on of the Extent of it; but to &s;ay, there are hardly any People to be &s;een there, is far from be|ing true in Fact; and whoever thinks fit to look into the Churches and Meeting-Hou&s;es on a Sunday, or other publick Days, will find there are very great Num|bers of people there: Or if he thinks fit to view the Market; and &s;ee how the large Shambles, call'd Cardinal Wol&s;ey s Butchery, are furni&s;h'd with Meat, and the re&s;t of the Market &s;tock'd with other Provi&s;ions mu&s;t acknowledge that it is not for a few People that all tho&s;e Things are provided: A Per&s;on very Curious, and on who&s;e Veracity I think I may depend, going thro' the Market in this Town, told me, that he rec|koned upwards of 600 Country People on Hor&s;eback and on Foot, with Bas|kets and other Carriage, who had all of them brought &s;omething or other to Town to &s;ell, be&s;ides the Butchers, and what came in Carts and Waggons.</P>
<P>It happen'd to be my Lot to be once at this Town at the time when a very fine new Ship, which was built there, for &s;ome Merchants of London, was to be launched; and if I may give my gue&s;s at the Numbers of People which appeared on the Shore, in the Hou&s;es, and on the River, I believe I am much within Compa&s;s, if I &s;ay there were 20,000 People to &s;ee it; but this is only a Gue&s;s, or they might come a great way to &s;ee the Sight, or the Town may be declin'd farther &s;ince that: But a View of the Town is one of the &s;ure&s;t Rules for a gro&s;s E&s;timate.</P>
<P>It is true, here is no &s;ettled Manu|facture: The French Refugees, when they fir&s;t came over to England, began a little to take to this Place, and &s;ome Mer|chants attempted to &s;et up a Linnen Manu|facture in their favour; but it has not met with &s;o much Succe&s;s as was expected, and at pre&s;ent I find very little of it. The poor people are however employ'd as they are all over the&s;e Counties, in &s;pin|ning Wool for other Towns where Manu|factures are &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The Country round Ip&s;wich, as are all the Counties &s;o near the Coa&s;t, is applied chiefly to Corn, of which a very great Quantity is continually &s;hip|ped off for London; and &s;ometimes they load Corn here for Holland, e&s;pe|cially if the Market abroad is encourag|ing They have 12 Pari&s;h-Churches in this Town, with three or four Meet|ings; but there are not &s;o many Quakers here as at Colche&s;ter, and no Anabap|ti&s;ts, or Anti-poedo Bapti&s;ts, that I could hear of, at lea&s;t there is no Meeting-hou&s;e of that Denomination: There is one Meeting-Hou&s;e for the Presbyteri|ans, one for the Independants, and one for the Quakers; the fir&s;t is as large and as fine a Building of that kind as mo&s;t on this &s;ide of England, and the in&s;ide the be&s;t fini&s;hed of any I have &s;een, Lon|don excepted; that for the Indepen|dants is a hand&s;ome new-built Building, but not &s;o gay, or &s;o large as the other.</P>
<P>There is a great deal of very good Company in this Town; and tho' there are not &s;o many of the Gentry here as at Bury, yet there are more here than in auy other Town in the County; and I ob&s;erv'd particularly, that the Company you meet with here, are generally per|&s;ons well informed of the World, and who have &s;omething very &s;olid and entertaining in their Society: This may happen, perhaps, by their frequent con|ver&s;ing with tho&s;e who have been abroad, and by their having a Remnant of Gen|tlemen and Ma&s;ters of Ships among them, who have &s;een more of the World than the people of an Inland Town are likely to have &s;een. I take this Town to be one of the mo&s;t agreeable places in England, for Families who have liv'd well, but may have &s;uffered in our late Calamities of Stocks and Bubbles, to retreat to, where they may live within their own Compa&s;s; and &s;everal things indeed recommend it to &s;uch;</P>
<P N="1">1. Good Hou&s;es at very ea&s;ie Rents.</P>
<P N="2">2. An airy, clean, and well-govern'd Town.</P>
<P N="3"><PB REF="30">
3. Very agreeable and improving Com|pany almo&s;t of every Kind.</P>

<P N="5">5 Tho&s;e Provi&s;ions very Cheap; &s;o that a Family may live cheaper here, than in any Town in England of its bigne&s;s, within &s;uch a &s;mall di&s;tance from London.</P>
<P N="6">6. E$&s;ie Pa&s;&s;age to London, either by Land or Water, the Coach going through to London in a Day.</P>
<P>The Lord Vi&s;count Hereford, has a very fine Seat and Park in this Town; the Hou&s;e indeed is old built, but very commodious; 'tis call'd Chri&s;t Church, having been as 'tis &s;aid, a Priory, or Re|ligious Hou&s;e in former Times: The Green and Park is a great addition to the Plea&s;antne&s;s of this Town, the Inhabi|tants being allowed to divert them&s;elves there with Walking, Bowling, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The large Spire Steeple which former|ly &s;tood upon that they call the Tower Church, was blown down by a great Storm of Wind many Years ago, and in its Fall did much damage to the Church.</P>
<P>The Government of this Town is by two Bailiffs, as at Yarmouth: Mr. Cam|den &s;ays they are cho&s;en out of twelve Burge&s;&s;es called Portmen, and two Ju&s;ti|ces out of twenty four more. There has been lately a very great Struggle between the two Parties for the choice of the&s;e two Magi&s;trates, which had this amicable Conclu&s;ion, namely, that they cho&s;e one of either &s;ide; &s;o that neither Party ha|ving the Victory, 'tis to be hoped it may be a Means to allay the Heats and un-neighbourly Feuds, which &s;uch things breed in Towns &s;o large as this is They &s;end two Members to Parliament, where|o$ tho&s;e at this time, are Sir William Thomp&s;on, Recorder of London, and Colonel Negus, Deputy-Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to the King.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Things very curious to be &s;een here, however &s;ome &s;uperficial Writers have been ignorant of them. Dr. Bee&s;ton, an emi ent Phy&s;ician, be|gan, a few Years ago, a Phy&s;ick Gar|den adjoining to his Hou&s;e in this Town, and as he is parcularly Curious, and as I was told, exqui&s;itely skill'd in Botanick Knowledge, &s;o he has been not only very diligent, but &s;ucce&s;sful too, in ma|king a Collection of rare and exotick Plants, &s;uch as are &s;carce to be equall'd in England.</P>
<P>One M. White, a Surgeon, re&s;ides al&s;o in this Town: But before I &s;peak of this gentleman, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that I &s;ay nothing from Per&s;onal Knowledge; tho' if I did, I have too good an Opi|nion of his Sen&s;e to believe he would be plea&s;ed with being flattered, or compli|mented in Print; but I mu&s;t be true to matter of Fact: This Gentleman has be|gun a Collection, or Chamber of Rarities, and with good Succe&s;s too. I acknow|ledge I had not the Opportunity of &s;eeing them: But I was told there are &s;ome things very Curious in it, as particu|larly a Sea Hor&s;e carefully pre&s;erv'd, and perfect in all its Parts; two Roman URNS full of A&s;hes of Human Bodies, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be above 1700 Years old; be&s;ides a great many valuable Me|dals, and ancient Coins. My Friend who gave me this Account, and of whom I think I may &s;ay he &s;peaks without Bya&s;s, mentions this Gentleman, Mr. White, with &s;ome Warmth, as a very valuable Per&s;on in his particular Employ, of a Surgeon, I only repeat his Words: <Q>&startq;Mr. White, &s;ays he, to whom the whole Town and Country are greatly in|debted and obliged to pray for his Life, is our mo&s;t skilfull Surgeon.&endq;</Q> The&s;e I &s;ay are his own Words, and I add nothing to them but this, that 'tis happy for a Town to have &s;uch a Sur|geon, as it is for a Surgeon to have &s;uch a Character.</P>
<P>The Country round Ip&s;wich, as if qualify'd on purpo&s;e to accommodate the Town for building of Ships, is an inexhau&s;table Sto$e-Hou&s;e of Timber, of which now their Trade of building Ships is abated, they &s;end very great Quanti|ties to the King's Building-yards at Chat|ham, which by Water is &s;o little a way, that they often run to it, from the Mouth
<PB REF="31">
of the River at Harwich, in one Tide.</P>
<P>From Ip&s;wich I took a Turn into the Country to Hadley, principally to &s;atis|fy my Curio&s;ity, and &s;ee the Place where that famous Martyr and Pattern of Cha|rity and Religious Zeal in Queen Mary's Time, Dr. Rowland Taylor, was put to Death; the Inhabitants, who have a wonderful Veneration for his Memory, &s;hew the very Place where the Stake which he was bound to was &s;et up, and they have put a Stone upon it, which no body will remove; but it is a more la&s;ting Monument to him, that he lives in the Hearts of the People; I &s;ay, more la&s;ting than a Tomb of Marble would bee, for the Memory of that good Man will certainly never be out of the poor People's Minds, as long as this I&s;land &s;hall retain the Prote&s;tant Religion a|momong them; how long that may be, as things are going, and if the dete&s;ta|ble Con&s;piracy of the Papi&s;ts now on Foot, &s;hould &s;ucceed, I will not pretend to &s;ay.</P>
<P>A little to the left is Sudbury, which &s;tands upon the River Stour, mentioned above; a River which parts the Coun|ties of Suffolk and E&s;&s;ex, and which is within the&s;e few Years made Navigable to this Town, tho' the Navigation does not (it &s;eems) an&s;wer the Charge, at lea&s;t not to Advantage.</P>
<P>I know nothing for which this Town is remarkable, except for being very Po|pulous and very Poor. They have a great Manufacture of Says and Perpetu|ana's; and multitudes of poor People are employ'd in working them; but the Number of the Poor is almo&s;t ready to eat up the Rich: However, this Town &s;ends two Members to Parliament, tho' it is under no form of Government par|ticularly to it&s;elf, other than as a Vil|lage, the Head Magi&s;trate whereof is a Con&s;table.</P>
<P>Near adjoining to it, is a Village cal|led Long-Melfort, and a very long one it is, from which I &s;uppo&s;e it had that addition to its Name; it is full of very good Hou&s;es, and, as they told me, is $icher, and has more wealthy Ma&s;ters of the Manufacture in it, than in Sud|bury it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here, and in the Neighbourhood, are &s;ome ancient Families of good Note; particularly here is a fine Dwelling, the ancient Seat of the Cordells, whereof Sir William Cordell was Ma&s;ter of the Rolls in the Time of Queen Elizabeth; but the Family is now extinct; the la&s;t Heir, Sir John Cordell, being killed by a Fall from his Hor&s;e, died unmarry'd, leaving three Si&s;ters, Co-heireffes to a very noble E&s;tate, mo&s;t of which, if not all, is now center'd in the only &s;urviving Si&s;ter and with her, in Marriage, is gi|ven to Mr. Firebra&s;s, elde&s;t Son of Sir Ba&s;il Fi$ebra&s;s, formerly a flouri&s;hing Merchant in London, but reduc'd by many Di&s;a&s;ters. His Family now ri&s;es by the good Fortune of his Son, who proves to be a Gentleman of very agree|able Parts, and well e&s;teemed in the Country.</P>
<P>From this part of the Country I return|ed North We&s;t by Lenham, to vi&s;it St. Edmund's Bury, a Town of which other Writers have talk'd very largely, and perhaps a little too much. It is a Town fam'd for its plea&s;ant Situation and whol|&s;ome Air, the Montpelier of Suffolk, and perhaps of England; this mu&s;t be attributed to the Skill of the Monks of tho&s;e Times, who cho&s;e &s;o beautiful a Situation for the Seat of their Retire|ment; and who built here the greate&s;t and, in its Time, the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Mona&s;tery in all the&s;e Parts of England, I mean the Mona&s;tery of St. Edmund the Martyr: It was, if we believe Antiqui|ty, a Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure in more ancient Times; or to &s;peak more properly, a Court of &s;ome of the Saxon or Ea&s;t-An|gle Kings; and, as Mr. Camden &s;ays, was even then called a Royal Village&punc; tho' it much better merits that Name now; it being the Town of all this Part of England, in proportion to its bigne&s;s&punc; mo&s;t thronged with Gentry, People of the be&s;t Fa&s;hion, and the mo&s;t polite Conver&s;ation: This beauty and healthi|ne&s;s of its Situation, was, no doubt, the Occa&s;ion which drew the Clergy to &s;ettle

here, for they always cho&s;e the be&s;t Places in the Country to build in, either for richne&s;s of Soil, or for Health and Plea&s;ure, in the Situation of their Reli|gious Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>For the like Rea&s;on, I doubt not, they tran&s;lated the Bones of the Martyr'd King St. Edmund, to this Place; for it is a vulgar Error to &s;ay, he was mur|thered here; his Martyrdom, it is plain, was at Hoxon or Henil&s;don, near Harl|&s;ton, on the Wavenry, in the farthe&s;t Northern Verge of the County; but Se|gebert, King of the Ea&s;t Angles, had built a religious Hou&s;e in this plea&s;ant $i$h Part of the County; and as the Monks began to ta&s;te the Plea&s;ure of the Place they procured the Body of this Saint to be removed hither, which &s;oon encreased the Wealth and Revenues of their Hou&s;e, by the Zeal of that Day, in going on Pilgrimage to the Shrine of the ble&s;&s;ed St. Edmund.</P>
<P>We read however, that after this, the Danes under King Sweno, over-running this part of the Country, de&s;troy'd this Mona&s;tery and burnt it to the Ground, with the Church and Town: But &s;ee the Turn Religion gives to Things in the World, his Son, King Canutus, at fir&s;t a Pagan and a Tyrant, and the mo&s;t cruel Ravager of all that Crew, coming to turn Chri&s;tian; and being touch'd in Con&s;cience for the Soul of his Father, in having robb'd God, and his Holy Mar|tyr St. Edmund, &s;acrilegiou&s;ly de&s;troying the Church, and plundering the Mona|&s;tery; I &s;ay, touch'd with Remor&s;e, and as the Monks pretend, terrify'd with a Vi&s;ion of St. Edmund appearing to him, he rebuilt the Hou&s;e, the Church, and the Town al&s;o, and very much added to the Wealth of the Abbot and his Fra|ternity, offering his Crown at the Feet of St. Edmund, giving the Hou&s;e to the Monks, Town and ill; &s;o that they were ab&s;olute Lords of the Town, and govern|ed it, by their Steward, for many Ages. He al&s;o gave them a great many good Lord&s;hips, which they enjoyed till the general Suppre&s;&s;ion of Abbies, in the Time of Henry VIII.</P>
<P>But I am neither writing the Hi&s;tory, or &s;earching the Antiquity, of the Ab|bey, or Town, my Bu&s;ine&s;s is the pre|&s;ent State of the Place.</P>
<P>The Abbey is demoli&s;h'd; its Ruins are all that is to be &s;een of its Glory: Out of the old Building, two very beau|tiful Churches are built, and &s;erve the two Pari$$es, into which the Town is divided, and they &s;tand both in one Church, yard. Here it was, in the Path|way between the&s;e two Churches, that a Tragical and almo&s;t unheard of Act of Barbarity was committed, which made the Place le&s;s plea&s;ant for &s;ome Time, than it us'd to be, when Arundel Coke, E&s;q; a Barri&s;ter at Law, of a very an|cient Family, attempted, with the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a barbarous A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, to Mur|ther in cold Blood, and in the Arms of Ho&s;pitality, Edward Cri&s;p, E&s;q; his Bro|ther-in-Law, leading him out from his own Hou&s;e, where he had invited him, his Wife and Children, to Supper; I &s;ay, leading him out in the Night&punc; on pre|tence of going to &s;ee &s;ome Friend that that was known to them both; but in this Church-yard, giving a Signal to the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in he had hired, he attack'd him with a Hedge-Bill, and cut him, as one might &s;ay, almo&s;t in Pieces, and when they did not doubt of his being Dead, they left him: His Head and Face was &s;o mangled, that it may be &s;aid to be next to a Miracle that he was not quite killed: Yet &s;o Providence directed for the exemplary Puni&s;hment of the A&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins, that the Gentleman recover'ed to detect them, who (tho' he out-lived the A&s;&s;ault) were both Executed, as they de&s;erv'd, and Mr. Cri&s;p is yet alive. They were Condemned on the Statute for Defacing and Di&s;membring, called the Coventry Act.</P>
<P>But this Accident does not at all le&s;|&s;en the Plea&s;ure and agreeable delightful &s;hew of the Town of Bury; it is croud|ed with Nobility and Gentry, and all Sorts of the mo&s;t agreeable Company; and as the Company Invites, &s;o there is the Appearance of Plea&s;ure upon the Situation; and tho&s;e that live at Bury,
<PB REF="33">
are &s;uppo&s;ed to live there for the &s;ake of it.</P>
<P>The Lord Jermin, afterwards Lord Dover, and &s;ince his Lord&s;hip's Decea&s;e, Sir Robert Davers, enjoy'd the mo&s;t delicious Seat of Ru&s;hbrook, near this Town.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Members of Parliament for this Place are, Jermyn Davers, and James Reynolds, E&s;qrs.</P>
<P>Mr. Harvey, afterwards created Lord Harvey, by King William, and &s;ince that, made Earl of Bri&s;tol by King George, liv'd many Years in this Town, leav|ing a noble and plea&s;antly &s;ituated Hou&s;e in Lincoln&s;hire, for the more agreeable living on a Spot &s;o compleatly quali|fied for a Life of Delight as this of Bury.</P>
<P>The Duke of Gra&s;ton, now Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, has al&s;o a &s;tately Hou&s;e at Eu&s;ton, near this Town, which he enjoys in Right of his Mother, Daugh|$$$ to the Earl of Arlington, one of the $word$ Mini&s;ters of State in the Reign of $$$g Charles II. and who made the &s;econd Letter in the Word CABAL; a Word form'd by that famous Sati$e|re&s;t Andrew Marvell, to repre&s;ent the five Heads of the Politicks of that time, as the Word SMECTYMNUS was on a former Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of this Town con&s;i&s;ts in the number of Gentry who dwell in and near it, the Polite Conver&s;ation among them, the Affluence and Plenty they live in; the &s;weet Air they breathe in, and the plea&s;ant Country they have to go abroad in.</P>
<P>Here is no Manufacturing in this Town, or but very little, except Spinning; the chief Trade of the Place depending up|on the Gentry who live there, or near it, and who cannot fail to cau&s;e Trade enough by the Expence of their Families and Equipages, among the People of a County Town. They have but a very &s;mall River, or rather but a very &s;mall Branch of a &s;mall River, at this Town, which runs from hence to Milden-Hall, on the edge of the Fens. However&punc; the Town and Gentlemen about, have been at the Charge, or have &s;o encourag'd the Engineer who was at the Charge, that they have made this River Navigable to the &s;aid Milden-Hall, from whence there is a Navigable Dyke, call'd Milden-Hall Dreyn, which goes into the River Ou&s;e, and &s;o to Lynn; &s;o that all their Coal and Wine, Iron, Lead, and other heavy Goods, are brought by Water from Lynn, or from London, by the way of Lynn to the great Ea&s;e of the Trade&s;men.</P>
<P>This Town is famous for two great Events: One was that in the Year 1447, in the 25th Year of Henry the VIth, a Parliament was held here.</P>
<P>The other was, That at the Meeting of this Parliament, the Great Humphry, Duke of Gloce&s;ter, Regent of the King|dom, during the Ab&s;ence of King Hen y the Vth, and the Minority of Henry the VIth, and to his la&s;t Hour, the Safeguard of the whole Nation, and Darling of the People, was ba&s;ely murdered here; by who&s;e Death, the Gate was opened to that dreadful War between the Hou&s;es of Lanca&s;ter and York, which ended in the Confu&s;ion of that very Race, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have contrived the murder</P>
<P>From St. Edmund's Bury I returned by Stow-Market and Needham, to Ip&s;|wich, that I might keep as near the Coa&s;t as was proper to my de&s;ign'd Cir|cuit or Journey; and from Ip&s;wich, to vi&s;it the Sea again, I went to Wood|bridge, and from thence to Orford, on the Sea-&s;ide.</P>
<P>Woodbridge has nothing remarkable, but that it a con&s;iderable Market for But|ter and Corn to be exported to London; for now begins that Part which is or|dinarily called High Suffolk; which be|ing a rich Soil, is for a long tract of ground, wholly employed in Daries; and they again famous for the be&s;t Butter, and per|haps the wor&s;t Chee&s;e, in England: The Butter is Barrelled, or often pickled up in &s;mall Casks, and &s;old, not in London only, but I have known a Firkin of Suf|folk Butter &s;ent to the We&s;t Indies, and brought back to England again, and has been perfectly Good and Sweet, as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Port for the Shipping off their Suffolk Butter is chiefly Woodbridge,
<PB REF="34" MS="Y">
which for that Rea&s;on is full of Corn-Factors, and Butter-Factors, and &s;ome of whom are very con&s;iderable Mer|chants.</P>
<P>From hence turning down to the &s;hore, we &s;ee Or$ord Ne&s;s, a noted Point of Land for the Guide of the Colliers and Coa&s;ters, and a good &s;helter for them to ride under, when a &s;trong North-Ea&s;t Wind blows and makes a foul Shoar on the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>South of the Ne&s;s is orfo$d Haven, be|ing the Mouth of two little Rivers meet|ing together; 'tis a very good Harbour fo$ $mall Ve&s;&s;els, but not capable of re|$eiving a Ship of Burthen.</P>
<P>Orford was once a good Town, but is decay'd, and as it &s;tands on the Land|&s;ide of the River, the Sea daily throws up more Land to it, and falls off i$&s;elf f$om it, as if it was re&s;olved to di&s;own the Place, and that it &s;hould be a Sea-Port no longer.</P>
<P>A little farther lies Albro', as thriv|ing, tho' without a Port, as the other is decaying, with a good River in the Front of it.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Gentlemen's Seats up far her f$om the Sea, but very few upon the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>From Albro' to Dunwich, there are no Towns of Note; even this Town &s;eems to be in Danger of being &s;wallow|ed up; for Fame reports, that once they had fifty Churches in the Town; I &s;aw but one left, and that not hal$ full of People.</P>
<P>This Town is a Te&s;timony of the decay of publick Things&punc; Things of the mo&s;t durable Nature; and as the old Poet expre&s;&s;es it:
<Q><L>By numerous Examples we may &s;ee,</L>
<L>That Towns and Cities Die, as well as we.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Ruins of Carthage, of the great City of Jeru&s;alem, or of antient Rome are not at all Wonderful to me; the Ruins of Ninev$h, which are &s;o en|tirely &s;unk, as that 'tis doubt$ul where the City &s;tood: The Ruins of Babylon, or the Great Per&s;epolis, and many Capital Cities, which Time and the Change of Monarchies have Overthrown; the&s;e, I &s;ay, are not all Wonderful, be|cau&s;e being the Capitals of great and flouri&s;hing Kingdoms, where tho&s;e King|doms were Overthrown, the Capital Cities nece&s;&s;arily &s;ell with them: But for a private Town, a Sea-Port, and a Town of Commerce, to decay, as it were of it&s;elf ($or we never read of Dunwich being plundered, or ruin'd, by any Di&s;a&s;ter, at lea&s;t not of late Years); this I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;eems ow|ing to nothing but to the Fate of Things, by which we &s;ee that Towns, Kings, Countries Families, and Per&s;ons, have all their Elevation, their Medium, their Declination, and even their De&s;truction in the Womb of Time, and the Cour&s;e of Nature. It is true, this Town is ma|nife&s;tly decayed by the inva&s;ion of the Waters, and as other Towns &s;eem &s;uf|ferers by the Sea, or the Tide withdraw|ing from their Ports, &s;uch as Orford, ju&s;t now named; Winchel&s;ea and Kent, and the like: So this Town is, as it were, eaten up by the Sea, as above; and the &s;till encroaching Ocean &s;eems to threa|ten it with a fatal Immer&s;ion in a few Years more.</P>
<P>Yet Dunwich, however ruin'd, retains &s;ome &s;hare of Trade, as particularly for the &s;hipping off Butter, Chee&s;e, and Corn, which is &s;o great a Bu&s;ine&s;s in this County, that it employs a great ma|ny People and Ships al$o; and this $ort lies right again&s;t the particular part of the County for Butter, as to Framling|ham, Hal&s;ted, &amp;c. Al&s;o a very great Quantity of Corn is bought up here-about for the London Market; for I &s;hall &s;till touch that Point, how all the Counties in England contribute &s;omething towards the Sub&s;i&s;tence of the Great City of London, of which the Butter here is a very con&s;iderable Article; as al&s;o coar$e Chee&s;e, which I mention'd before, us'd chiefly.</P>
<P>Hereabouts they begin to talk of Herrings and the Fi&s;hery; and we find in the ancient Records that the Town, which was then equal to a la$ge City&punc;
<PB REF="35" MS="Y">
paid, among other Tribute to the Go|vernment, 50000 of Herrings. Here al&s;o, and at Swole, or Southole, the next Seaport, they Cure Sprats in the &s;ame manner as they do Herrings at Yarmouth; that is to &s;ay, &s;peaking in their own Language, they make red Sprats; or to &s;peak good Engli&s;h, they make Sprats red.</P>
<P>It is Remarkable, that this Town is now &s;o much wa&s;hed away by the Sea, that what little Trade they have, is car|ry'd on by Walder&s;wick, a little Town near Swole, the Ve&s;&s;els coming in there, becau&s;e the Ruins of Dunwich make the Shore there un&s;afe to the Boats, from whence the Northern Coa&s;ting Seamen, a rude Ver&s;e of their own u&s;ing, and I &s;uppo&s;e of their own making; as follows,
<Q><L>Swoul and Dunwich, and Walder&s;wick,</L>
<L>All go in at one lou&s;ie Creek.</L></Q>
This lou&s;ie Creek, in &s;hort, is a little River at Swoul, which our late famous Atlas-maker calls a good Harbour for Ships, and Rendezvous of the Royal Navy; but that by the bye; the Author, it &s;eems, knew no better.</P>
<P>From Dunwich, we came to South|wold, the Town above-named; this is a &s;mall Port-Town upon the Coa&s;t, at the Mouth of a little River call'd the Bli$h: I found no Bu&s;ine&s;s the People here were employ'd in, but the Fi&s;hery, as above, for Herrings and Sprats; which they Cure by the help of Smoak, as they do at Yarmouth.</P>
<P>There is but one Church in this Town, but it is a very large one and well built, as mo&s;t of the Churches in this County are, and of impenetrable Flint; indeed there is no Occa&s;ion for its being &s;o large, for &s;taying there one Sabbath-Day, I was &s;urprized to &s;ee an extraordinary large Church, capable of receiving five or &s;ix thou&s;and People, and but Twenty &s;even in it be&s;ides the Par&s;on and the Clerk; but at the &s;ame Time, the Meeting-hou&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters was full to the very Doors, having, as I gue&s;s'd, from 6 to 800 People in it.</P>
<P>This Town is made famous for a very great Engagement at Sea, in the Year 1672, between the Engli&s;h and Dutch Fleets, in the Bay oppo&s;ite to the Town; in which, not to be partial to our&s;elves, the Engli&s;h Fleet was wor&s;ted; and the brave Montague Earl of Sandwich, Ad|miral under the Duke of Y ork, lo&s;t his Life: The Ship Royal Prince, carrying 100 Guns, and which was, under him, commanded by Sir Edward Spragg, was Burnt, and &s;everal other Ships loft, and about 600 Seamen; part of tho&s;e killed in the Fight were, as I was told, brought on Shore here and buried in the Church|yard of this Town, as others al&s;o were at Ip&s;wich.</P>
<P>At this Town in particular, and &s;o at all the Towns on this Coa&s;t from Orford-Ne&s;s to Yarmouth, is the ordinary Place where our Summer Friends the Swallows, fir&s;t Land when they come to vi&s;it us; and here they may be &s;aid to embark for their Return&punc; when they go back into warmer Climates; and, as I think the following Remark, tho' of &s;o trifling a Circum&s;tance, may be both In&s;tructing as well as Diverting, it may be very pro|per in this Place. The Ca&s;e is this, I was &s;ome Years before at this Place, at the latter end of the Year, viz about the beginning of October, and in a Hou&s;e that looked into the Church-yard, I ob|&s;erv'd, in the Evening, an unu&s;ual mul|titude of Birds &s;itting on the Leads of the Church; Curio&s;ity led me to go near|er to &s;ee what they were, and I found they were all Swallows; that there was &s;uch an infinite Number that they cover|ed the whole Roof of the Church, and of &s;everal Hou&s;es near, and perhaps might of more Hou&s;es which I did not &s;ee; this led me to enquire of a grave Gentleman whom I &s;aw near me, what the Meaning was of &s;uch a prodigious Multitude of Swallows &s;itting there? O Sir, &s;ays he, turning towards the Sea, you may &s;ee the Rea&s;on, the Wind is off Sea. I did not &s;eem fully informed by that Expre&s;&s;ion; &s;o he goes on: I perceive, Sir, &s;ays he, you are a Stran|ger to it; you mu&s;t then under&s;tand,
<PB REF="36">
fir&s;t, that this is the Sea&s;on of the Year when the Swallows, their Food here fail|ing, begin to leave us, and return to the Country, where-ever it be, from whence I &s;uppo&s;e they came; and this being the neare&s;t to the Coa&s;t of Holland, they come here to Embark; this he &s;aid Smi|ling a little; and now Sir, &s;ays he, the Weather being too calm, or the Wind contrary, they are waiting for a Gale, for they are all Wind-bound.</P>
<P>This was more evident to me, when in the Morning I found the Wind had come about to the North-we&s;t in the Night, and there was not one Swallow to be &s;een, of near a Million, which I be|lieve was there the Night before.</P>
<P>How tho&s;e Creatures know that this Part of the I&s;land of Great-Britain is the Way to their Home, or the way that they are to go; that this very Point is the neare&s;t Cut over, or even that the near|e&s;t Cut is be&s;t for them, that we mu&s;t leave to the Naturali&s;ts to determin, who in&s;i&s;t upon it, that Brutes cannot Think.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the Swallows nei|ther come hither for warm Weather, nor retire from Cold, the thing is of quite a|nother Nature; they, like the &s;hoals of Fi&s;h in the Sea, pur&s;ue their Prey; they are a voracious Creature, they feed fly|ing; their Food is found in the Air, viz. the In&s;ects; of which in our Summer Evenings, in damp and moi&s;t Places, the Air is full; they come hither in the Sum|mer, becau&s;e our Air is fuller of Fogs and Damps than in other Countries, and for that Rea&s;on, feeds great Quantities of In&s;ects, if the Air be hot and dry, the Gnats die of them&s;elves, and even the Swallows will be found fami&s;h'd for Want, and fall down dead out of the Air, their Food being taken from them: In like manner, when cold Weather comes in, the In&s;ects all die, and then of Nece&s;&s;ity, the Swallows quit us, and fol|low their Food where-ever they go, this they do in the manner I have men|tioned above; for &s;ometimes they are &s;een to go off in va&s;t Flights like a Cloud; and &s;ometimes again, when the Wind grows fair, they go away a few and a few, as they come, not &s;taying at all up|on the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Note, This pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing of the Swallows, is ob&s;erv'd no where &s;o much, that I have heard of, or in but few other Places, except on this Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t; namely, from above Harwich to the Ea&s;t Point of Norfolk, called Win|terton Ne&s;s North; which is all right again&s;t Holland, we know nothing of them any farther North, the Pa&s;&s;age of the Sea being, as I &s;uppo&s;e, too broad from Flambro' Head, and the Shoar of Holderne&s;s in York&s;hire, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I find very little remarkable on this &s;ide of Suffolk, but what is on the Sea-Shoar as above; the Inland Country is that which they properly call High $word$ folk, and is full of rich feeding $word$ and large Farms, mo&s;tly employ'd $word$ Dayries for making the Suffolk $word$ and Chee&s;e, of which I have &s;poken $word$ ready: Among the&s;e rich Grounds, &s;tand &s;ome Market-Towns, tho' not of very con&s;iderable Note&punc; &s;uch as Framlingham, where was once a Royal Ca&s;tle, to which Queen Mary retir'd, when the Northumberland Fraction, in behalf of the Lady Jane, endeavoured to &s;upplant her: and it was this part of Suffolk where the Go&s;pellers, as they were then called, prefer'd their Loyalty to their Religion, and complimented the Popi&s;h Line at Expence of their Share of the Reformation; but they paid dear for it, and their Succe&s;&s;ors have learned better Politicks &s;ince.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Parts are al&s;o feveral good Market-Towns, &s;ome in this County, and &s;ome in the other, as Becles, Bun|gay, Harl&s;ton &amp;c. all on the Edge of the River Waveney, which parts here the Counties of Suffolk and Norfolk: And here in a Bye-Place, and out of Common Remark, lies the antient Town of Hoxon, famous for being the Place where St. Edmund was mar$yr$d, for whom &s;o many Cells and Shrines have been &s;et up, and Mona&s;teries built; and in Honour of whom, the famous Mona&s;|tery of St. Edmund's Bury above-men|tioned,
<PB REF="37" MS="Y">
tioned, was Founded, which mo&s;t Peo|ple erroneou&s;ly think was the Place where the &s;aid Murder was committed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Towns mention'd above, there are Hale&s;worth, Saxmundham, De|benham, Aye, or Eye, all &s;tanding in this Ea&s;tern &s;ide of Suffolk; in which, as I have &s;aid, the whole Country is employ'd in Dairies, or in feeding of Cattle.</P>
<P>This part of England is al&s;o remark|ble for being the fir&s;t where the feeding and fattening of Cattle, both Sheep as well as black Cattle with Turnips, was fir&s;t Practis'd in Edgland, which is made a very great part of the Improvement of their Lands on this Day; and from whence the Practice is &s;pread over mo&s;t of the Ea&s;t and South Parts of England, to the great Enriching of the Farmers, and encrea&s;e of &s;at Cattle: And tho' &s;ome have objected again&s;t the good|ne&s;s of the Fle&s;h thus fed with Turnips, and have fan&s;ied it would ta&s;te of the Root, yet upon Experience itis found, that at Market there is no difference nor can they that buy, &s;ingle out one Joynt of Mutton from another by the Ta&s;te: So that the Complaint which our nice Palates are fir&s;t made, begins to cea&s;e of it&s;elf, and a very great Quan|tity of Bee&s;, and Mutton al&s;o, is brought every Year, and every Week to Lon|don, from this &s;ide of England, and much more than was formerly known to be &s;ed there.</P>
<P>I can't omit, however little it may &s;eem, that this County of Suffolk is par|ticularly famous for furni&s;hing the City of London, and all the Counties round, with Turkeys, and that 'tis thought, there are more Turkeys bred in this County, and the Part of Norfolk that adjoins to it, than in all the re&s;t of England, e&s;pecially for Sale; tho' this may be rec|kon'd, as I &s;ay above, but a trifling thing to take notice of in the&s;e Remarks; yet, as I have hinted, that I &s;hall ob&s;erve, how London is in general &s;upplied with all its Provi&s;ions from the whole Body of the Nation, and how every Part of the I&s;land is engaged in &s;ome degree or other of that Supply: On this Account I could not omit it; nor will it be found &s;o incon&s;ider|able an Article as &s;ome may imagine, if this be true which I receiv'd an account of from a Per&s;on living on the Place, (viz.) That they have counted 300 Droves of Turkeys (for they drive them all in Droves on Foot) pa&s;s in one Sea&s;on over Stratford-Bridge on the River Stour, which parts Suffolk from E&s;&s;ex, about &s;ix Miles from Colche&s;ter, on the Road from Ip&s;wich to London. The&s;e Droves, as they &s;ay, generally contain from three Hundred to a Thou&s;and each Drove; &s;o that one may &s;uppo&s;e them to contain 500 one with another, which is 150000 in all; and yet this is one of the lea&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, the Numbers which travel by New Market-Heath, and the open Coun|try and the Fore&s;t; and al&s;o the Numbers that come by Sudbury, and Clare being many more.</P>
<P>For the further Supplies of the Markets of London with Poultry, of which the&s;e Countries particularly abound: They have within the&s;e few Years found it practica|ble to make the Gee&s;e Travel on Foot too, as well as the Turkeys; and a pro|digious Number are brought up to Lon|don in Droves from the farthe&s;t Parts of Norfolk; even from the Fenn Country, about Lynn, Downham, Wiesbich, and the Wa&s;hes; as al&s;o from all the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of Norfolk and Suffolk, of whom 'tis very frequent now to meet Droves, with a Thou&s;and, &s;ometimes two Thou&s;and in a Drove: They begin to drive them ge|nerally in Augu&s;t, by which time the Harve&s;t is almo&s;t over, and the Gee&s;e may feed in the Stubbles as they go. Thus they hold on to the end of October, when the Roads begin to be too &s;tiff and deep for their broad Feet and &s;hort Legs to march in.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Methods of driving the&s;e Creatures on Foot, they have of late al&s;o invented a new Method of Cariage, be|ing Carts form'd on purpo&s;e, with four Sto|ries or Stages, to put the Creatures in one above another, by which Invention one Cart will carry a very great number; and for the &s;mother going, they drive with two Hor&s;es a-brea&s;t, like a Coach, &s;o quartering the Road for the Ea&s;e of the Gentry that
<PB REF="38" MS="Y">
thus ride; changing Hor&s;es they travel Night and Day: &s;o that they bring the Fowls 70, 80, or 100 Miles in two Days and one Night: The Hor&s;es in this new|fa&s;hion'd Voiture go two a-Brea&s;t, as above, but no Perch below as in a Coach, but they are fa&s;ten'd together by a piece of Wood lying Cro&s;s-wi&s;e upon their Necks, by which they are kept even and together&punc; and the Driver &s;its on the Top of the Cart, like as in the publick Car|riages for the Army, &amp;c</P>
<P>In this manner they hurry away the Creatures alive, and infinite Numbers are thus carried to London every Year. This Method is al&s;o particular for the carrying young Turkeys, or Turkey-poults in their Sea&s;on, which are Valuable, and yield a good Price at Market; as al&s;o for live Chickens in the dear Sea&s;ons; of all which a very great Number are brought in this manner to London, and more prodigiou&s;|ly out of this Country than any other part of England, which is the Rea&s;on of my &s;peaking of it here.</P>
<P>In this Part, which we call High Suf|folk, there are not &s;o many Families of Gentry or Nobility plac'd, as in the other &s;ide of the Country: But 'tis ob&s;erv'd, that tho' their Seats are not &s;o frequent here, their E&s;tates are; and their plea&s;ure of We&s;t Suffolk is much of it &s;upported by the Wealth of High Suffolk; for the rich|ne&s;s of the Lands, and application of the People to all kinds of Improvement, is &s;carce credible; al&s;o the Farmers are &s;o very con&s;iderable, and their Farmsand Dai|ries &s;o large, that 'tis very frequent for a Farmer to have a thou&s;and Pounds Stock upon his Farm in Cows al&s;o.</P>

<P>When we come into Norfolk, we &s;ee a Face of Diligence &s;pread over the whole Country; the va&s;t Manufactures carry'd on (in chief) by the Norwich Weav|ers, employs all the Country round in &s;pinning Yarn for them; be&s;ides many thou&s;and Packs of Yarn which they receive from other Countries, even from as far as York&s;hire, and We&s;tmoreland, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in its Place.</P>
<P>This &s;ide of Norfolk is very populous, and throng'd with great and &s;pacious Market-Towns, more and larger than any other Part of England &s;o far from London, except Devon&s;hire, and the We&s;t-riding of York&s;hire; for Example, between the Frontiers of Suffolk and the City of Norwich on this &s;ide, which is not above 22 Miles in breadth, are the following Market-Towns, viz. Thet|ford, Dis, Harling, Bucknam, Hingham, We&s;t Deerham, Attleboro', Windham, Harle&s;ton, E. Deerham, Watton, Lod|don, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e Towns are very popu|lous
<PB REF="39" MS="Y">
and large; but that which is mo&s;t remarkable is, that the whole Country round them is &s;o inter&s;pers'd with Villa|ges, and tho&s;e Villages &s;o large, and &s;o full of People, that they are equal to Market-Towns in other Countries; in a Word, they render this Ea&s;tern part of Norfolk exceeding full of Inhabitants.</P>
<P>An eminent Weaver of Norwich, gave me a Scheme of their Trade on this Occa&s;ion, by which, calculating from the number of Looms at that time em|ployed in the City of Norwich only, be|&s;ides tho&s;e employ'd in other Towns in the &s;ame County, he made it appear ve|ry plain, that there were 120000 Peo|ple employ'd in the Woollen and Silk and Wool Manufactures of that City only; not that the People all lived in the City, tho' Norwich is a very large and populous City too: But I &s;ay, they were employ'd for &s;pinning the Yarn u&s;ed for &s;uch Goods as were all made in that City. This Acconnt is Curious enough, and very exact, but it is too long for the compa&s;s of this Work.</P>
<P>This &s;hews the Wonderful Extent of the Norwich Manufacture, or Stuff-weav|ing Trade, by which &s;o many thou&s;ands of Families are maintained. Their Trade indeed felt a very &s;en&s;ible Decay, and the Cries of the Poor began to be very loud, when the wearing of painted Cal|licoes was grown to &s;uch an height in England, as was &s;een about two or three Years ago; but an Act of Parliament having been obtained, tho' not with|out great Struggle, in the Years 1720, and 1721, for prohibiting the u&s;e and wearing of Callico's, the Stuff Trade reviv'd incredibly; and as I pa&s;s'd this part of the Country in the Year 1723, the Manufacturers a&s;&s;ured me, that there was not in all the Ea&s;tern and middle part of Norfolk, any Hand unemploy'd, if they would Work; and that the very Children after four or five Years of Age, could every one earn their Bread. But I return to &s;peak of the Villages and Towns in the re&s;t of the County; I &s;hall come to the City of Norwich by it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>This throng of Villages continues thro' all the Ea&s;t part of the Country, which is of the greate&s;t Extent, and where the Manufacture is chiefly carry'd on: If any part of it be wa&s;te and thin of Inhabitants, it is the We&s;t Part, draw|ing a Line from about Brand or Bran|don, South to Wal&s;ingham, North. This part of the Country indeed is full of open Plains, and &s;omewhat Sandy and Barren, and feeds great Flocks of good Sheep: But put it all together, the County of Norfolk has the mo&s;t People in the lea&s;t Tract of Land of any County in England, except about London, and Ex|on, and the We&s;t-Riding of York&s;hire, as above.</P>
<P>Add to this, that there is no &s;ingle County in England, except as above, that can boa&s;t of three Towns &s;o Popu|lous, &s;o Rich, and &s;o famous for Trade and Navigation, as in this County: By the&s;e three Towns, I mean the City of Norwich, the Towns of Yarmouth and Lynn; be&s;ides, that it has &s;everal other Sea Ports of very good Trade, as Wisbich, Wells, Burnham, Clye, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Norwich is the Capital of all the County, and the Center of all the Trade and Manufactures which I have ju&s;t mention'd; an ancient large, rich, and populous City: If a Stranger was only to ride thro' or view the City of Nor|wich for a Day, he would have much more Rea&s;on to think there was a Town without Inhabitants, than there is really to &s;ay &s;o of Ip&s;wich; but on the contrary, if he was to view the City, either on a Sabbath-day, or on any publick Occa&s;ion, he would wonder where all the People could dwell, the Multitude is &s;o great: But the Ca&s;e is this: The Inhabitants being all bu&s;ie at their Manufactures, dwell in their Garrets at their Looms, and in their Combing-&s;hops, &s;o they call them, Twi&s;ting Mills, and other Work-Hou&s;es; almo&s;t all the Works they are employ'd in, being done within Doors. There are in this City thirty-two Pa|ri&s;hes be&s;ides the Cathedral, and a great many Meeting-Hou&s;es of Di&s;&s;enters of all Denominations. The publick Edifices
<PB REF="40" MS="Y">
are chiefly the Ca&s;tle, antient and de|cayed, and now for many Years pa&s;t made u&s;e of for a Jayl. The Duke of Norfolk's Hou&s;e was formerly kept well, and the Gardens pre&s;erved for the plea|&s;ure and Diver&s;ion of the Citizens, but &s;ince feeling too &s;en&s;ibly the &s;inking cir|cum&s;tances of that once glorious family, who were the fir&s;t Peers and Hereditary Earl-Mar&s;hals of England.</P>
<P>The Walls of this City are reckon'd three Miles in Circumference, taking in more Ground than the City of London; but much of that Ground lying open in Pa&s;ture-fields and Gardens, nor does it &s;eem to be, like &s;ome antient places, a decayed declining Town and that the Walls mark out its antient Dimen&s;ions; for we do not &s;ee Room to &s;uppo&s;e that it was ever larger or more populous than it is now: But the Walls &s;eem to be placed, as if they expected that the City would in time encrea&s;e &s;ufficiently to fill them up with Buildings.</P>
<P>The Cathedral of this City is a fine Fabrick, and the Spire-Steeple very high and beautiful; it is not antient, the Bi&s;h|op's See having been fir&s;t at Thetford; from whence it was not tran&s;lated hither till the Twelfth Century; yet the Church has &s;o many Antiquities in it, that our late great Scholar and Phy&s;ician, Sir Tho. Brown, thought it worth his while to write a whole Book to collect the mo|numents and In&s;criptions in this Church, to which I refer the Reader.</P>
<P>The River Yare runs through this Ci|ty, and is navigable thus far without the help of any Art, (that is to &s;ay, without Locks or Stops) and being encreas'd by other Waters, pa&s;&s;es afterwards thro' a long Tract of the riche&s;t Meadows, and the large&s;t, take them altogether, that are any where in England, lying for thirty Miles in length, from this City to Yar|mouth, including the return of the &s;aid Meadows on the Bank of the Wavency South, and on the River Thyrn, North.</P>
<P>Here is one thing indeed &s;trange in it|&s;elf, and more &s;o, in that Hi&s;tory &s;eems to be quite ignorant of the Occa&s;ion of it. The River Waveney is a con&s;iderable Ri|ver, and of a deep and full Channel, Navigable for large Barges as high as Beccles, it runs for a Cour&s;e of about fifty Miles, between the two Counties of Suffolk and Norfolk, as a boundary to both, and pu&s;hing on, tho' with a gen|tle Stream, towards the Sea, no one would doubt, but, that when they &s;ee the River growing broader and deeper, and going directly towards the Sea, even to the Edge of the Beach; that is to &s;ay, within a Mile of the main Ocean; no Stranger, I &s;ay, but would expect to &s;ee its Entrance into the Sea at that place, and a noble Harbour for Ships at the Mouth of it; when on a &s;udden, the Land ri&s;ing high by the Sea-&s;ide, cro&s;&s;es the head of the River, like a Dam, checks the whole Cour&s;e of it, and it returns, bending its Cour&s;e We&s;t, for two Miles, or thereabouts; and then turning North, thro' another long Cour&s;e of Meadows (joining to tho&s;e ju&s;t now mention'd) &s;eeks out the River Yare, that it may join its Water with her's, and find their way to the Sea together.</P>
<P>Some of our Hi&s;torians tell a long Fa|bulous Story of this River's being once open, and a famous Harbour for Ships belonging to the Town of Leo&s;tof ad|joining: But that the Town of Yarmouth envying the Pro&s;perity of the &s;aid Town of Leo&s;tof, made War upon them; and that after many bloody Battles, as well by Sea as by Land, they came at la&s;t to a Deci&s;ive Action at Sea with their re|&s;pective Fleets, and the Victory fell to the Yarmouth Men, the Leo&s;tof Fleet being Overthrown and uttely de&s;troyed; and that upon this Victory, the Yarmouth Men either actually did &s;top up the Mouth of the &s;aid River, or oblig'd the vanqui&s;h'd Leo&s;tof Men to do it them|&s;elves, and bound them never to attempt to open it again.</P>
<P>I believe my &s;hare of this Story, and I recommend no more of it to the Reader; adding, that I &s;ee no Authority for the Relation, neither do the Relators agree either in the Time of it, or in the Parti|culars of the Fact; that is to &s;ay, in who&s;e reign, or under what Govern|ment
<PB REF="41">
all this happened, in what Year, and the like: So I &s;atisfy my&s;elf with tran&s;cribing the Matter of Fact, and then leave it as I find it.</P>
<P>In this va&s;t Tract of Meadows are fed a prodigious number of black Cattle, which are &s;aid to be &s;ed up for the fat|te&s;t Beef, tho' not the large&s;t in Eng|land; and the Quantity is &s;o great, as that they not only &s;upply the City of Norwich, the Town of Yarmouth, and County adjacent, but &s;end great Quanti|ties of them Weekly in all the Winter Sea&s;on, to London.</P>
<P>And this in particular is worthy Re|mark, That the gro&s;s of all the Scots Cattle which come yearly into England, are brought hither, being brought to a &s;mall Village lying North of the City of Norwich, call'd St. Faiths, where the Norfolk Gra&s;iers go and buy them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Scotch Runts, &s;o they call them, coming out of the cold and barren Moun|tains of the Highlands in Scotland, feed &s;o eagerly on the rich Pa&s;ture in the&s;e Mar&s;hes, that they thrive in an unu&s;ual manner, and grow mon&s;trou&s;ly Fat; and the Beef is &s;o delicious for Ta&s;te, that the Inhabitants prefer 'em to the Eng|li&s;h Cattle, which are much larger and fairer to look at, and they may very well do &s;o: Some have told me, and I I believe with good Judgment, that there are above 40,000 of the&s;e Scots Cattle &s;ed in this County every Year, and mo&s;t of them in the &s;aid Mar&s;hes between Nor|wich, Beccles, and Yarmouth.</P>
<P>Yarmouth is an antient Town, much older than Norwich; and at pre&s;ent, tho' not &s;tanding on &s;o much Ground, yet better built; much more compleat; for number of Inhabitants, not much inferior; and for Wealth, Trade, and advantage of its Situation, &s;uperior to Norwich.</P>
<P>It is plac'd on a Penin&s;ula between the River Yare and the Sea; the two la&s;t ly|ing Parallel to one another, and the Town in the middle: The River lies on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the Town, and being grown very large and deep, by a conflux of all the Rivers on this &s;ide the County, forms the Haven; and the Town facing to the We&s;t al&s;o, and open to the River, makes the fine&s;t Key in England, if not in Europe, not inferior even to that of of Mar&s;eilles it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Ships ride here &s;o clo&s;e, and as it were, keeping up one another, with their Head-fa&s;ts on Shore, that for half a Mile together, they go cro&s;s the Stream with their Bow&s;prits over the Land, their Bows, or Heads, touching the very Wharf; &s;o that one may walk from Ship to Ship as on a floating Bridge, all along by the Shore-&s;ide: The Key reach|ing from the Draw-Bridge almo&s;t to the South Gate, is &s;o &s;pacious and wide, that in &s;ome Places 'tis near One hun|dred $ards f om the Hou&s;es to the Wharf. In this plea&s;ant and agreeable range of Hou&s;es are &s;ome very magnificent Build|ings, and among the re&s;t, the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e and Town-Hall, and &s;ome Mer|chants Hou&s;es, which look like little Pa|laces, rather than the Dwelling Hou&s;es of private Men.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Defect of this beautiful Town, &s;eems to be, that tho' it is very rich and encrea&s;ing in Wealth and Trade, and con&s;equently in People, there is not Room to enlarge the Town by Build|ing; which would be certainly done much more than it is, but that the River on the Land-&s;ide pre&s;cribes them, except at the North End without the Gate; and even there the Land is not very agreeable: But had they had a larger Space within the Gates, there would before now, have been many &s;pacious Streets of noble fine Buildings erected, as we &s;ee is done in &s;ome other thriving Towns in England, as at Liverpool, Man|che&s;ter, Bri&s;tol, Frome, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Key and the Harbour of this Town during the Fi&s;hing-Fair, as they call it, which is every Michaelmas, one &s;ees the Land cover'd with People, and the River with Barks and Boats, bu&s;y Day and Night, laying and carrying off the Herrings, which they catch here in &s;uch Quantities, that it is incredible. I happen'd to be there during their Fi&s;hing Fair, when I told, in one Tide, 100 and ten Barks and fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els coming
<PB REF="42">
up the River, all loaden with Herrings, and all taken the Night before; and this was be&s;ides what was brought on Shore on the Dean, (that is the Sea&s;ide of the Town) by open Boats, which they call Cobles, and which often bring in two or three La&s;t of Fi&s;h at a time. The Barks often bring in Ten La&s;t a peice.</P>
<P>This Fi&s;hing-Fair begins on Michael|mas day, and la&s;ts all the Month of Octo|ber, by which time the Herrings draw off to Sea, &s;hoot their Spawn, and are no more fit for the Merchants Bu&s;ine&s;s; at lea&s;t not tho&s;e that are taken there abouts.</P>
<P>The Quantity of Herrings that are catch'd in this Sea&s;on are diver&s;ly ac|counted for; &s;ome have &s;aid, that the Towns of Yarmouth and Leo&s;tof only, have taken Forty thou&s;and La&s;t a Sea&s;on: I will not venture to confirm that Re|port; but this I have heard the Mer|chants them&s;elves &s;ay, (viz.) That they have Cur'd, that is to &s;ay, Hang'd and Dry'd in the Smoak, 40,000 Barrels of merchantable Red-Herrings in one Sea|&s;on, which is in it&s;elf (tho' far &s;hort of the other) yet a very con&s;iderable Ar|ticle; and it is to be added, that this is be&s;ides all the Herrings con&s;um'd in the Country Towns of both tho&s;e populous Counties, for thirty Miles from the Sea, whither very great Quantities are carry'd every Tide during the whole Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>But this is only one Branch of the great Trade carry'd on in this Town: Another Part of this Commerce, is in the exporting the&s;e Herrings after they are Cur'd; and for this their Merchants have a great Trade to Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, Me&s;&s;ina, and Venice; as al&s;o to Spain and Portugal, al&s;o exporting with their Herrings very great Quantities of Wor&s;ted Stuffs, and Stuffs made of Silk and Wor&s;ted; Camblets &amp;c. the Manu|factures of the neighbouring City of Nor|wich, and of the Places adjacent.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, they carry on a very con|&s;iderable Trade with Holland, who&s;e oppo&s;ite Neighbours they are; and a va&s;t Quantity of Woollen Manufactures they $word$ to the Dutch every Year. Al&s;o they have a Fi&s;hing-Trade to the North-Seas for White Fi&s;h, which from the Place are called the North Sea God.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a con&s;iderable Trade to Norway, and to the Baltick, from whence they bring back Deals, and Fir-Timber, Oaken Plank Baulks, Sparrs, Oars, Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax Spruce Canvas, and Sail-Cloth; with all man|ner of Navel Stores' which they gene|rally have a con&s;umption for in their own Port, where they build a very great Number of Ships every Year, be&s;ides re|fitting and repairing the old</P>
<P>Add to this Coal Trade between New|ca&s;tle and the River of Thames, in which they are &s;o improv'd of late Years, that they have now a greater &s;hare of it than any other Town in England; and have quite work'd the Ip&s;wich Men out of it, who had formerly the chief &s;hare of the Colliery in their Hands.</P>
<P>For the carrying on all the&s;e Trades, they mu&s;t have a very great Number of Ships, either of their own, or employ'd by them; and it may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be judg'd of by this, That in the Year 1697, I had an account from the Town Regi|&s;ter, that there was then 1123 &s;ail of Ships u&s;ing the Sea, and belong'd to he Town, be&s;ides &s;uch Ships as the Mer|chants of Yarmouth might be concern'd in, and be Part-Owners of, belonging to any other Ports.</P>
<P>To all this I mu&s;t add, without Com|pliment to the Town, or to the People, that the Merchants, and even the ge|nerality of Traders of Yarmouth, have a very good Reputation in Trade, as well Abroad as at Home, for Men of fair and honourable Dealing punctual and ju&s;t in their performing their Engage|ments, and in di&s;charging Commi&s;&s;ions; and their Seamen, as well Ma&s;ters as Ma|riners, are ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd among the able&s;t and mo&s;t expert Navigators in England.</P>
<P>This Town however populous and large was ever contained in one Pari&s;h, and had but one Church; but within the&s;e two Years they have built another very fine Church, near the South-end of the
<PB REF="43">
$own. The old Church is dedicated to $t. Nicholas, and was built by that fa|$ous Bi&s;hop of Norwich, William Her|$ert, who flouri&s;hed in the Reign of William II, and Henry I. William of Malmsbury calls him <HI>Vir Pecunio&s;us;</HI> he might have called him <HI>Vir Pecunio|$$&s;imus,</HI> con&s;idering the Times he lived $n, and the Works of Charity and Mu|$ificence, which he has left as Witne&s;|$es of his immen&s;e Riches; for he built $he Cathedral Church, the Priory for Sixty Monks, the Bi&s;hop's Palace, and $he Pari&s;h-Church of St. Leonard, all in Norwich; this great Church at Yar|mouth, the Church of St Margaret at Lynn, and of St Mary at Elmham. He removed the Epi&s;copal See from Thet|ford to Norwich, and in&s;tituted the Clu|niack Monks at Thetford, and gave them, or built them a Hou&s;e. This old Church is very large, and has a high Spire, which is a u&s;eful Sea-Mark.</P>
<P>Here is one of the fine&s;t Market-pla|ces, and the be&s;t &s;erv'd with Provi&s;ions, in England, London excepted, and the Inhabitants are &s;o multiplied in a few Years, that they &s;eem to want room in their Town, rather than People to fill it, as I have ob&s;erved above.</P>
<P>The Streets are all exactly &s;trait from North to South, with Lanes or Alleys, which they call Rows, cro&s;&s;ing them in &s;trait Lines al&s;o from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; &s;o that it is the mo&s;t regular built Town in England, and &s;eems to have been built all at once; Or, that the Dimen&s;ions of the Hou&s;es, aud the Extent of the Streets, were laid out by Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>They have particular Priviledges in this Town, and a Juri&s;diction by which they can Try, Condemn, and Execute in E&s;pecial Ca&s;es, without waiting for a Warrant from Above; and this they ex|erted once very &s;martly, in Executing a Captain of one of the King's Ships of War, in the Reign of King Charles II, for a Murther committed in the Street, the Circum&s;tance of which did indeed call for Ju&s;tice, but &s;ome thought they would not have ventur'd to exert their Power as they did; however, I never never heard that the Government re|&s;ented it, or blamed them for it.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a very well overn'd Town and I have no where, in England, ob|&s;erved the Sabbathday &s;o exactly kept, or the Breach &s;o continually puni&s;hed as in this Place, which I name to their Honour.</P>
<P>Among all the&s;e Regularities, it is no Wonder if we do not find abundance of Revelling, or that there is little Encou|ragement to A&s;&s;emblies, Plays, and Ga|ming-Meetings at Yarmouth, as in &s;ome other Places; and yet I do not &s;ee that the Ladies here come behind any of the neighbouring Counties, either in Beauty, Breeding, or Behaviour; to which may be added too, not at all to their Di&s;ad|vantage, that they generally go beyond them in Fortunes.</P>
<P>From Yarmouth I re&s;olved to pur&s;ue my fir&s;t De&s;ign, viz. To view the Sea|&s;ide on this Coa&s;t, which is particularly Famous for being one of the mo&s;t dan|nerous and mo&s;t fatal to the Sailors in all England, I may &s;ay in all Britain; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e of the great Number of Ships which are continually going and coming this Way, in their Pa&s;&s;age between London and all the Nor|thern Coa&s;ts of Great-Britain. Matters of Antiquity are not my Enquiry, but principally Ob&s;ervations of the pre&s;ent State of Things worthy of Recording, as have never been ob&s;erved before; and this leads me the more directly to men|tion the Commerce and the Navigation when I come to Towns upon the Coa&s;t, as what few Writers have yet medled with.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of the Dangers of this particular Coa&s;t, are found in the Situa|tion of the County, and in the Cour&s;e of Ships failing this way, which I &s;hall de&s;cribe as well as I can, thus, the Shoar from the Mouth of the River of Thames to Yarmouth Road, lies in a &s;trait Line from S. S. E. to N. N. W. the Land be|ing on the W. or Larboard Side.</P>
<P>From Winterton Ne&s;s, which is the utmo&s;t Northerly Point of Land in the County of Norfolk, and about four Miles
<PB REF="44">
beyond Yarmouth, the Shoar falls off for near &s;ixty Miles to the We&s;t, as far as Lynn and Bo&s;ton, till the Shoar of Lincoln&s;hire tends North again for about &s;ixty Miles more, as far as the Humber, whence the Coa&s;t of York&s;hire, or Hol|derne&s;s, which is the Ea&s;t Riding, &s;hoots out again into the Sea, to the Spurn, and to Flambro' Head, as far Ea&s;t al|mo&s;t as the Shoar of Norfolk had given back at Winterton making a very deep Gulph or Bay, between tho&s;e two Points of Winterton and the Spurn Head; &s;o that the Ships going North, are obliged to &s;tretch away to Sea, from Winterton Ne&s;s, and leaving the Sight of Land in that deep Bay which I have mentioned, that reaches to Lynn, and the Shoar of Lincoln&s;hire, they go, I &s;ay, N. or &s;till N. N. W. to meet the Shoar of Holder|ne&s;s, which I &s;aid runs out into the Sea again at the Spurn, this they leave al&s;o, and the fir&s;t Land they make, or de&s;ire to make, is called Flambro' Head; &s;o that Winterton Ne&s;s and Flambro' Head, are the two Extremes of this Cour&s;e, there is, as I &s;aid, the Spurn Head in|deed between; but as it lies too far in towards the Humber, they keep out to the North to avoid coming near it.</P>
<P>In like manner the Ships which come from the North, leave the Shoar at Flam|bro' Head, and &s;tretch away S. S. E. for Yarmouth Roads; and the fir&s;t Land they make is Winterton Ne&s;s (as above.) Now, the Danger of the Place is this; if the Ships coming from the North are taken with a hard Gale of Wind from the S. E. or from any Point between N. E. and S. E. &s;o that they cannot as the Seamen call it, weather Winterton Ne&s;s, they are thereby kept in within that deep Bay, and if the Wind blows hard, are often in Danger of running on Shoar upon the Rocks about Cromer, on the North Coa&s;t of Norfolk, or &s;trand|ing upon the flat Shoar between Cron|mer and Wells; all the Relief they have is good Ground Tackle to ride it out, which is very hard to do there, the Sea coming very high upon them; or if they cannot ride it out then, to run into the Bottom of the great Bay I mentioned&punc; to Lynn, or Bo&s;ton, which is a very dif|ficult and de&s;perate Pu&s;h: So that &s;ome|times, in this Di&s;tre&s;s, whole Fleets have been lo&s;t here all together</P>
<P>The like is the Danger to Ships going Northward, if after pa&s;&s;ing by Winter|ton they are taken &s;hort with a North-Ea&s;t Wind, and cannot put back into the Roads, which very often happens, then they are driven upon the &s;ame Coa&s;t&punc; and Embay'd ju&s;t as the latter. The Danger on the North part of this Bay is not the &s;ame, becau&s;e if Ships going or coming &s;hould be taken &s;hort on this &s;ide Flambro', there is the River Humber open to them, and &s;everal good Roads to have recour&s;e to, as as Bur|lington Bay, Grimsby Road, and the Spurn Head, and others, where they ride under &s;helter.</P>
<P>The Dangers of this Place being thus con&s;idered, 'tis no wonder, that upon the Shoar beyond Yarmouth, there are no le&s;s than four Light-Hou&s;es kept flam|ing every Night, be&s;ides the Lights at Ca&s;tor, North of the Town, and at Goul&s;ton S, all which are to direct the Sailors to keep a good Offing, in Ca&s;e of bad Weather, and to prevent their running into Cromer Bay, which the Seamen call the Devils Troat.</P>
<P>As I went by Land from Yarmouth Northward, along the Shoar towards Cromer afore&s;aid, and was not then ful|ly Ma&s;ter of the Rea&s;on of the&s;e things, I was &s;urprized to &s;ee, in all the Way from Winterton, that the Farmers, and Country People had &s;carce a Barn, or a Shed, or a Stable, nay, not the Pales of their Yards, and Gardens, not a Hog|&s;tye, not a nece&s;&s;ary-hou&s;e, but what was built of old Planks, Beams, Wales and Timbers, &amp;c. the wrecks of Ships, and Ruins of Mariners and Merchants fortunes; and in &s;ome Places were $hole Yards fill'd, and piled up very high with the &s;ame Stuff lay'd up, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, to &s;ell for the like building Purpo&s;es, as there &s;hould be occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>About the year 1692, (I think it was that year) there was a Melancholy $word$
<PB REF="45">
the Man&s;ion of the Family, were not form'd with &s;o much Art in vain, or to to die with the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>After this we &s;aw Brently, the Seat of the Earl of Dy&s;ert, and the ancient Palace of my Lord Cornwallis, with &s;e|veral others of exqui&s;ite Situation, and adorn'd with the Beauties both of Art and Nature; &s;o that I think, any Tra|veller from Abroad, who would de&s;ire to &s;ee how the Engli&s;h Gentry live, and what Plea&s;ures they enjoy, &s;hould come into Suffolk and Cambridge&s;hire, and take but a light Circuit among the Country Seats of the Gentlemen on this &s;ide only, and they would be &s;oon con|vinc'd, that not France, no not Italy it|&s;elf, can out-do them, in Proportion to the Climate they liv'd in.</P>
<P>I had &s;till the County of Cambridge to vi&s;it, to compleat this Tour of the Ea&s;tern Part of England, and of that I come now to &s;peak.</P>
<P>We enter Cambridge&s;hire out of Suf|folk with all the Advantage in the world; the County beginning upon tho&s;e agree|able Plains call'd New Market-Heath, where pa&s;&s;ing the Devil's Ditch, which has nothing worth Notice but its Name, and that but fabulous too, from the Hills call'd Gogmagog, we &s;ee a rich and plea&s;ant Vale We&s;tward, cover'd with Corn Fields, Gentlemen's Seats, Villages, and at a Di&s;tance, to crown all the re&s;t, that anciently and truly famous Town and Univer&s;ity of Cambridge; Capital of the County, and receiving its Name from, if not as &s;ome &s;ay, giving Name to it; for if it be true, that the Town takes its Name of Cambridge from its Bridge over the River Cam; then certainly the Shire or County, upon the Divi&s;ion of England into Counties had its Name from the Town, and Cam|bridge&s;hire &s;ignifies no more or le&s;s than the County of which Cambridge is the Capital Town.</P>
<P>As my Bu&s;ine&s;s is not to lay out the Geographical Situation of Places, I &s;ay nothing of the Buttings and Boundings of this County: It lies on the Edge of the great Level, call'd by the People $line$ if not all the I&s;le of Ely, lies in this County and Norfolk: The re&s;t of Cam|bridge&s;hire is almo&s;t wholly a Corn Country; and of that Corn five Parts in &s;ix, of all they &s;ow, is Barly, which is generally &s;old to Ware and Roy&s;ton, and other great Malting Towns in Hert|ford&s;hire, and is the Fund from whence that va&s;t Quantity of Malt, call'd Hert|ford&s;hire Malt, is made, which is e&s;teem'd the be&s;t in England. As E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, are taken up in Manu|factures, and fam'd for Indu&s;try, this County has no Manufacture at all; nor are the Poor, except the Husband-men, fam'd for any thing &s;o much as idlene&s;s and &s;loth, to their Scandal be it &s;poken; what the Rea&s;on of it is, I know not.</P>
<P>It is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to talk of any thing in Cambridge&s;hire but Cambridge&s;hire it&s;elf; whether it be that the County has &s;o little worth &s;peaking of in it, or that the Town has &s;o much, that I leave to others; however, as I am making Mo|dern Ob&s;ervations, not writing Hi&s;tory, I &s;hall look into the County as well as into the Colleges, for what I have to &s;ay.</P>
<P>As I &s;aid, I fir&s;t had a view of Cam|bridge from Gogmagog Hills; I am to add, that there appears on the Moun|tain that goes by this Name, an antient Camp, or Fortification, that lies on the Top of the Hill, with a double, or rather treble Rampart and Ditch, which mo&s;t of our Writers &s;ay, was neither Ro|man nor Saxon, but Briti&s;h: I am to add, that King James II cau&s;ed a &s;pa|cious Stable to be built in the Area of this Camp, for his Running Hor&s;es, and made old Mr. Frampton, whom I mention'd above, Ma&s;ter or In&s;pector of them: The Stables remain &s;till there, tho' they are not often made u&s;e of. As we de&s;cend|ed We&s;tward, we &s;aw the Fenn Coun|try on our Right, almo&s;t all cover'd with Water like a Sea, the Michaelmas Rains having been very great that Year, they had &s;ent down great Floods of Water from the Upland Countries, and tho&s;e Fenns being as may be very pro|perly &s;aid, the &s;ink of no le&s;s than $word$ $line$
<PB REF="46">
the Water, or mo&s;t part of the Water of thirteen Counties, falls into them, they are often thus overflow'd. The Rivers which thus empty them&s;elves into the&s;e Fenns, and which thus carry off the Water, are the Cam or Grant, the Great Ou&s;e, and Little Ou&s;e, the Nene, the Welland, and the River which runs from Bury to Milden-Hall; the Counties which the&s;e Rivers drain, as above, are as follows,</P>
<P>Lincoln, * Cambridge, * Hunting|don, * Bedford, Buckingham, Warwick, Oxford Leice&s;ter, * Northampton, * Rut|land, Norfolk, Suffolk, E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>Note, Tho&s;e Mark'd with (*) empty all their Waters this Way, the re&s;t but in Part.</P>
<P>In a Word, all the Water of the mid|dle Part of England which does not run into the Thames or the Trent, comes down into the&s;e Fenns.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Fenns are abundance of tho&s;e admirable Pieces of Art call'd Duckoys; that is to &s;ay, Places &s;o adapted for the harbour and &s;helter of Wild-Fowl, aud then furni&s;h'd with a Breed of tho&s;e they call Decoy-Ducks, who are taught to allure and entice their Kind to the Places they belong to, that it is incredi|ble what Quantities of Wild-fowl of all &s;orts, Duck, Mallard, Teal, Widgeon, &amp;c. they take in tho&s;e Duckoys every Week, during the Sea&s;on; it may in|deed be gue&s;s'd at a little by this, that there is a Duckoy not far from Ely, which pays to the Landlord, Sir Thomas Hare 500 l. a Year Rent, be&s;ides the Charge of maintaining a great number of Servants for the Management; and from which Duckoy alone they a&s;&s;ured me at St. Ives, (a Town on the Ou&s;e&punc; where the Fowl they took was always brought to be &s;ent to London;) that they gene|rally &s;ent up three thou&s;and Couple a Week.</P>
<P>There are more of the&s;e about Peter|borow who &s;end the Fowl up twice a Week in Waggon Loads at a time, who&s;e Waggons before the late Act of Parlia|ment to regulate Carries, I have &s;een drawn by ten, and twelve Hor&s;es a piece they were loaden &s;o heavy.</P>
<P>As the&s;e Fenns appear cover'd with Water, &s;o I ob&s;erv'd too, that they gene|rally at this latter part of the Year appear al&s;o cover'd with Foggs, &s;o that when the Downs and higher Grounds of the adjacent Country were gilded with the Beams of the Sun, the I&s;le of Ely look'd as if wrapp'd up in Blankets, and no|thing to be &s;een, but now and then, the Lanthorn or Cupola of Ely Min&s;ter.</P>
<P>One could hardly &s;ee this from the Hills and not pity the many thou&s;ands of Families that were bound to or confin'd in tho&s;e Foggs, and had no other Breath to draw than what mu&s;t be mix'd with tho&s;e Vapours, and that Steam which &s;o univer&s;ally over&s;pread the Country: But notwith&s;tanding this, the People, e&s;|pecially tho&s;e that are u&s;ed to it, live un|concern'd and as Healthy as other Folks, except now and then an Ague, which they make light of, and there are great Numbers of very antient People among them.</P>
<P>I now draw near to Cambridge, to which I fan&s;y I look as if I was afraid to come, having made &s;o many Circum|locutions beforehand; but I mu&s;t yet make another Digre&s;&s;ion before I enter the Town; (for in my way, and as I came in from New Market, about the beginning of September;) I cannot omit, that I came nece&s;&s;arily through Sturbridge Fair, which was then in its height.</P>
<P>If it is a Diver&s;ion worthy a Book to treat of Trifles, &s;uch as the Gayety of Bu|ry Fair, it cannot be very unplea&s;ant, e|&s;pecially to the Trading part of the World, to &s;ay &s;omething of this Fair, which is not only the greate&s;t in the whole Nation, but in the World; nor, if I may believe tho&s;e whg have &s;een them all, is the Fair at Leip&s;ick in Saxony the Mart at Frank|fort on the Main, or the Fairs at Neu|remberg, or Ausburg, any way to com|pare to this Fair at Sturbridge.</P>
<P>It is kept in a large Corn-field, near Ca&s;terton, extending from the Side of the River Cam, towards the Road, for about half a Mile Square.</P>
<P><PB REF="47">
If the Husbandmen who rent the Land, do not get their Corn off before a certain Day in Augu&s;t, the Fair-Keepers may trample it under Foot, and &s;poil it, to build their Booths, or Tents, for all the Fair is kept in Tents, and Booths: On the other Hand, to ballance that Severi|ty, if the Fair-Keepers have not done their Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Fair, and removed and cleared the Field by another certain Day in September, the Plowmen may come in again, with Plow and Cart, and overthrow all, and trample it into the Dirt; and as for the Filth, Dung Straw, &amp;c. nece&s;&s;arily left by the Fair-Keepers, the Quantity of which is very great, it is the Farmers Fees, and makes them full amends for the trampling, riding, and carting upon, and hardening the Ground</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe all the Parts and Circum&s;tances of this Fair exactly; the Shops are placed in Rows like Streets, whereof one is called Cheap&s;ide; and here, as in &s;everal other Streets, are all $orts of Trades, who &s;ell by Retale, and who come principally from London with their Goods; &s;carce any Trades are omit|ted, Gold&s;miths, Toy&s;hops, Bra&s;iers, Mer|ters, Drapers, Pewterers, China-Ware|hou&s;es, and, in a Word, all Trades that can be named in London; with Coffee|hou&s;es, Taverns, Brandy-Shops, and Eating-Hou&s;es innumerable, and all in Tents, and Booths, as above.</P>
<P>This great Street reaches from the Road, which, as I &s;aid, goes from Cam|bridge to New-Market, turning &s;hort out of it to the Right towards the River, and holds, in a Line, near half a Mile, quite down to the River-&s;ide. In another Street, parallel with the Road, are like Rows of Booths, but larger, and more $ntermingled with Whole&s;ale Dealers, and one Side, pa&s;&s;ing out of this la&s;t Street $word$ the left Hand, is a formal great Square, $orm'd by the large&s;t Booths, built in $hat Form, and which they call the $uddery; whence the Name is derived, $nd what its Signification is, I could ever yet learn, though I made all po&s;$ble &s;earch into it. The Area of this Square is about 80 to 100 Yards, where the Dealers have Room, before every Booth, to take down, and open their Packs, and to bring in Waggons to load and unload.</P>
<P>This Place is &s;eparated, and peculiar to the Whole&s;ale Dealers in the Woollen Manufacture. Here the Booths, or Tents, are of a va&s;t Extent, have different A|partments, and the Quantities of Goods they bring are &s;o Great, that the In&s;ides of them look like another Blackwell-Hall, being as va&s;t Ware-Hou&s;es piled up with Goods to the Top. In this Drud|dery, as I have been informed, there have been Sold one Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds worth of Woollen Manufactures in le&s;s than a Week's Time; be&s;ides the prodigious Trade carry'd on here, by Whole&s;ale-Men, from London, and all Parts of England, who tran&s;act their Bu|&s;ine&s;s wholly in their Pocket Books, and meeting their Chapmen from all Parts, make up their Accompts, receive Mo|ney chiefly in Bills, and take Orders: The&s;e, they &s;ay, exceed, by far, the Sales of Goods actually brought to the Fair&punc; and delivered in kind; it being fre|quent for the London Whole&s;ale Men to carry back Orders from their Dealers for ten Thou&s;and Pounds worth of Goods a Man, and &s;ome much more. This e|&s;pecially, re&s;pects tho&s;e People who deal in heavy Goods, as Whole&s;ale Grocers, Salters, Bra&s;iers, Iron-Merchants&punc; Wine-Merchants, and the like; but does not exclude the Dealers in Woollen Manu|factures, and e&s;pecially in Mercery Goods of all Sorts&punc; the Dealers in which gene|rally manage their Bu&s;ine&s;s in this Man|ner</P>
<P>Here are Clothiers from Hallifax, Leeds. Wakefield and Huthersfield, in York&s;hire, and from Rochdale, Bury, &amp;c. in Lanca&s;hire, with va&s;t Quantities of York&s;hire Cloths, Ker&s;eys, Penni&s;tons, Cottons, &amp;c. with all Sorts of Manche|&s;ter Ware, Fu&s;tians, and Things made of Cotton Wool; of which the Quanti|ty is &s;o great, that they told me there were near a Thou&s;and Hor&s;e-Packs of $line$
<PB REF="48">
and the&s;e took up a &s;ide and half of the Duddery at lea&s;t; al&s;o a part of a Street of Booths were taken up with Up|hol&s;terer's Ware, &s;uch as Tickings, Sack|ings, Kiddermin&s;ter Stuffs, Blankets, Rugs, Quilts, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the Duddery I &s;aw one Ware-hou&s;e, or Booth, with &s;ix Apartments in it, all belonging to a Dealer in Norwich Stuffs only, and who they &s;aid had there a|bove Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds value, in tho&s;e Goods, and no other.</P>
<P>We&s;tern Goods had their Share here al&s;o, and &s;everal Booths were fill'd as full with Serges, Duroys, Druggets, Shal|loons, Cantaloons, Devon&s;hire Ker&s;ies, &amp;c. from Exeter, Taunton, Bri&s;tol, and other Parts We&s;t, and &s;ome from London al&s;o.</P>
<P>But all this is &s;till outdone at lea&s;t in &s;how, by two Articles, which are the peculiars of this Fair, and do not begin till the other part of the Fair, that is to &s;ay for the Wollen Manufacture begins to draw to a Clo&s;e: The&s;e are the Wooll, and the Hops; as for the Hops, there is &s;carce any Price fix'd for Hops in Eng|land, till they know how they &s;ell at Sturbridge Fair; the Quantity that ap|pears in the Fair is indeed prodigious, and they, as it were, po&s;&s;e&s;s a large Part of the Field on which the Fair is kept, to them&s;elves; they are brought directly from Chelmsford in E&s;&s;ex, from Canterbury and Maid&s;tone in Kent, and from Farnham in Surrey, be&s;ides what are brought from London, the growth of tho&s;e, and other Places.</P>
<P>Enquiring why this Fair &s;hould be thus, of all other Places in England, the Cen|ter of that Trade; and &s;o great a Quan|tity of &s;o bulky a Commodity be carried thither &s;o far: I was an&s;wered, by one thoroughly acquainted with that Matter, thus: The Hops, &s;aid he, for this Part of England, grow principally in the two Counties of Surrey and Kent, with an exception only to the Town of Chelms|ford in E&s;&s;ex, and there are very few planted any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>There are indeed, in the We&s;t of $word$ $line$ Wilton, near Salisbury; at Hereford and Broom&s;grove, near Wales, and the like but the Quantity is incon&s;iderable, and the Places remote, &s;o that none of them come to London.</P>
<P>As to the North of England, they for|merly u&s;ed but a few Hops there, their Drink being pale &s;mooth Ale, which re|quir'd no Hops, and con&s;equently they planted no Hops in all that part of Eng+land, North of Trent; nor did I ever &s;ee an Acre of Hop-Ground, planted beyond Trent, in my Ob&s;ervations; but as for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, they not only brew great Quantities of Beer in the North but al&s;o u&s;e Hops, in the brewing their Ale, much more than they did before &s;o they all come South of Trent to buy their Hops; and here being va&s;t Quan|tities brought, 'tis great Part of their back Carriage into York&s;hire, and North|ampton&s;hire, Derby&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire and all tho&s;e Counties; nay, of late &s;ince the Union, even to Scotland it&s;elf for I mu&s;t not omit here al&s;o to mention that the River Grant, or Cam, which runs clo&s;e by the N. W. &s;ide of the Fair, in its way from Cambridge to Ely is Navigable, and that by this means all heavy Goods are brought even to the Fair-Field, by Water Carriage from London, and other Parts; fir&s;t to the Port of Lynn, and then in Barges up the Ou&s;e, from the Ou&s;e into the Cam and &s;o, as I &s;ay, to the very Edge of the Fair.</P>
<P>In like manner great Quantities of hea|vy Goods, and the Hops among the re&s;t are &s;ent from the Fair to Lynn, by Wa|ter, and &s;hipped there for the Humber to Hull, York, &amp;c. and for New-Ca&s;tle upon Tyne, and by New-Ca&s;tle, even to Scotland it&s;elf Now as there is &s;till no planting of Hops in the North, though a great Con&s;umption, and the Con&s;ump+tion increa&s;ing Daily, this, &s;ays my Friend, is one Rea&s;on why at Sturbridge Fair there is &s;o great a Demand for the Hops. He added, that be&s;ides this there were very few Hops, if any word naming, growing in all the Counties even on this &s;ide Trent, which were a
<PB REF="49">
above forty Miles from London; tho&s;e Counties depending on Sturbridge Fair for their &s;upply, &s;o the Counties of Suf|folk, Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Northampton, Lincoln, Leice&s;ter, Rut|land, and even to Stafford, Warwick and Worce&s;ter&s;hire, bought mo&s;t if not all their Hops at Sturbridge Fair.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Rea&s;ons why &s;o great a Quantity of Hops are &s;een at this Fair, as that it is incredible, con&s;idering too, how remote from this Fair the Growth of them is, as above.</P>
<P>This is likewi&s;e a Te&s;timony of the prodigious re&s;ort of the Trading People of all Parts of England to this Fair; the Quantity of Hops that have been &s;old at one of the&s;e Fairs is diver&s;ly reported, and &s;ome affirm it to be &s;o great, that I dare not copy after them; but without doubt it is a &s;urpri&s;ing Account, e&s;peci|ally in a cheap Year.</P>
<P>The next Article brought hither, is Wooll, and this of &s;everal &s;orts, but prin|cipally Fleece Wooll out of Lincoln&s;hire, where the longe&s;t Staple is found; the Sheep of the&s;e Countries being of the large&s;t Breed.</P>
<P>The Buyers of this Wooll, are chiefly indeed the Manufactures of Norfolk and Suffolk, and E&s;&s;ex, and it is a prodigious Quantity they buy.</P>
<P>Here I &s;aw what I have not ob&s;erv'd in any other Country of England, namely, a Pocket of Wooll. This &s;eems to be fir&s;t call'd &s;o in Mockery, this Pocket being &s;o big, that it loads a whole Waggon, and reaches beyond the mo&s;t extream Parts of it hanging over both before, and behind, and the&s;e ordinarily weigh a Ton or 25 Hundred weight of Wooll, all in one Bag.</P>
<P>The Quantity of Wooll only, which has been &s;old at this Place at one Fair, has been &s;aid to amounty to fifty or &s;ixty Thou&s;and Pounds in value &s;ome &s;ay a great deal more.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Articles a Stranger may make &s;ome gue&s;s, at the immen&s;e Trade car|ried on at this Place; what prodigious Quantities of Goods are bought, and &s;old here, and what a confluence of Peo|ple are &s;een here from all Parts of England.</P>
<P>I might go on here to &s;peak of &s;everal other &s;orts of Engli&s;h Manufactures, which are brought hither to be &s;old; as all &s;orts of wrought Iron, and Bra&s;s Ware from Birmingham; Edg'd Tools, Knives, &amp;c. from Sheffield; Gla&s;s Wares, and Stock|ings, from Nottingham, and Leice&s;ter and an infinite Throng of other things of &s;maller, value, every Morning.</P>
<P>To attend this Fair, and the prodigi|ous conflux of People, which come to it, there are &s;ometimes no le&s;s than fifty Hackney Coaches, which come from London, and ply Night and Morning to carry the People to and from Cam|bridge; for there the Gro&s;s of the Peo|ple lodge; nay, which is &s;till more &s;trange, there are Wherries brought from London on Waggons to plye upon the little River Cam, and to row People up and down from the Town, and from the Fair as Occa&s;ion pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>It is not be wondered at, if the Town of Cambridge cannot receive, or entertain the Numbers of People that come to this Fair; not Cambridge only, but all the Towns round are full; nay, the very Barns, and Stables are turn'd into Inns, and made as fit as they can to Lodge the meaner &s;ort of People: As for the People in the Fair, they all univer&s;ally Eat, Drink and Sleep in their Booths, and Tents&punc; and the &s;aid Booths are &s;o intermingled with Taverns, Coffee-Hou&s;es, Drinking-Hou&s;es, Eating-Hou&s;es, Cooks-Shops, &amp;c. and, all in Tents too, and &s;o many Butch|ers, and Higlers from all the Neighbour|ing Counties come into the Fair every Morning with Beef, Mutton, Fowls, Butter, Bread, Chee&s;e, Eggs, and &s;uch things; and go with them from Tent to Tent, from Door to Door, that there's no want of any Provi&s;ions of any kind, either dre&s;s'd, or undre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>In a Word, the Fair is like a well for|tify'd City, and there is the lea&s;t Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion (I believe) that can be &s;een any where, with &s;o great a Concour&s;e of People.</P>
<P>Towards the latter End of the Fair, and when the great Hurry of Whole&s;ale

Bu&s;ine&s;s begins to be over, the Gentry come in, from all Parts of the County $ound; and tho' they come for their Diver&s;ion; yet &punc;tis not a little Money, they lay out, which generally falls to the &s;hare of the Retailers, &s;uch as Toy|&s;hops, Gold&s;miths, Bra&s;iers, Ironmong|ers, Turners, Milleners, Mercers, &amp;c. and &s;ome loo&s;e Corns, they re&s;erve for the Pupput Shows, Drolls, Rope Dan|cers, and &s;uch like; of which there is no want, though not con&s;iderable like the re&s;t: The la&s;t Day of the Fair is the Hor&s;e Fair, where the whole is clos'd with both Hor&s;e and Foot Races, to divert the meaner &s;ort of People only, for no|thing con&s;iderable is offer'd of that Kind: Thus Ends the whole Fair, and in le&s;s than a Week more, there is &s;carce any Sign left that there has been &s;uch a thing there; except by the Heaps of Dung and Straw, and other Rubbi&s;h which is left behind, frod into the Earth, and which is as good as a Summer's fallow for Dunging to the Land; and as I have &s;aid above, pays the Husbandman well for the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mention'd, that here is a Court of Ju&s;tice always open, and held every Day in a Shed built on pur|po&s;e in the Fair; this is for keeping the Peace, and deciding Controver&s;ies in i$ matters Deriving from the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Fair: Magi&s;trates of the Town of Cambridge are Judges in this Court, as being their Juri&s;diction, or they holding it by &s;pecial Priviledge: Here they deter|mine Matters in a Summary way, as is practis'd in tho&s;e we call Pye-Powder Courts in other Places, or as a court of Con|&s; ience; and they have a final Authority wi hout Appeal.</P>
<P>I come now to the Town, and Uni|ver&s;ity of Cambridge: I &s;ay the Town and Univer&s;ity, for tho' they are Blend|ed together in the Situation, and the Colleges, Halls, and Hou&s;es for Litera|ture are promi&s;cuou&s;ly &s;catter'd up and down among the other Parts, and &s;ome even among the meane&s;t of the other Buildings; as Magdalen College over the Bridge, is in particular; yet they are all Encorporated together, by the Name of the Univer&s;ity, and are govern'd apart and di&s;tinct from the Town, which they are &s;o intermix'd with.</P>
<P>As their Authority is di&s;tinct from the Town, &s;o are their Priviledge,, Cu&s;toms, and Government; they choo&s;e Repre&s;en|tatives, or Members of Parliament for them&s;elves, and the Town does the like for them&s;elves al&s;o apart.</P>
<P>The Town is govern'd by a Mayor, and Aldermen. The Univer&s;ity by a Chancellor, and Vice-Chancellor, &amp;c. Tho' their Dwellings are mix'd and &s;eem a little confus'd, their Authority is not &s;o; in &s;ome Ca&s;es the Vice Chancellor may concern him&s;elf in the Town, as in &s;earching Hou&s;es for the Scholars at im|proper Hours, removing &s;candalous Wo|men, and the like.</P>
<P>But as the Colleges are many, and the Gentlemen entertain'd in them are a very great Number, the Trade of the Town very much depends upon them, and the Trade&s;men may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to get their Bread by the Colleges; and this is the &s;ure&s;t hold the Univer&s;ity may be &s;aid to have of the Town&s;men, and by which they &s;ecure the Depen|dence of the Town upon them, and con|&s;equently their Submi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I remember &s;ome Years ago a Brewer, who being very rich and popular in the Town, and one of their Magi&s;trates, had in &s;everal things &s;o much oppos'd the U|niver&s;ity, and in&s;ulted their Vice Chan|cellor, or other Heads of Hou&s;es, that in &s;hort the Univer&s;ity having no other way to exert them&s;elves, and &s;how their Re|&s;entment, they made a By-Law or Order among them&s;elves, that for the future they would not Trade with him, and that none of the Colleges, Halls, &amp;c. would take any more Beer of him; and what follow'd&punc; The Man indeed brav'd it out a while but when he found he cou'd not obtain a Revocation of the Order, he was fain to leave off his Brewhou&s;e, and if I remem|ber right, quitted the Town.</P>
<P>Thus I &s;ay, Intere&s;t gives them Autho|rity; and there are abundance of Rea&s;ons why the Town &s;hou'd not di&s;oblige the Univer&s;ity, as there are &s;ome al&s;o o$
<PB REF="51">
the other Hand, why the Univer&s;ity &s;hould not differ to any Extremity with the Town; nor, &s;uch is their Prudence, do they let any Di&s;putes between them run up to any Extremities, if they can avoid it. As for Society; to any Man who is a lover of Learning, or of learn|ed Men, here is the mo&s;t agreeable un|der Heaven; nor is there any want of Mirth and good Company of other Kinds. But 'tis to the Honour of the Univer&s;ity to &s;ay, that the Governors &s;o well under|&s;tand their Office, and the Governed their Duty, that here is very little En|couragement given to tho&s;e Seminaries of Crime the A&s;&s;emblies, which are &s;o much boa&s;ted of in other Places.</P>
<P>Again, as Dancing, Gaming, Intrieg|ing, are the three principal Articles which recommend tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, and that generally the Time for carrying on Af|fairs of this Kind, is the Night, and &s;ometimes all Night; a Time as Un&s;ea|&s;onable as Scandalous; add to this, that the Orders of the Univer&s;ity admit no &s;uch Exce&s;&s;es: I therefore &s;ay, as this is the Cafe, 'tis to the Honour of the whole Body of the Univer&s;ity, that no Encou|ragement is given to them here.</P>
<P>As to the Antiquity of the Univer&s;ity in this Town, the Originals and Foun|ders of the &s;everal Colleges, their Reve|nues, Laws, Government and Governors, they are &s;o effectually and &s;o largely treat|ed of by other Authors, and are &s;o fo|reign to my De&s;ign, that I refer my Rea|ders to Mr. Camden's Britannia, and the Author of the Antiquities of Cambridge, and other &s;uch learned Writers, by whom they may be fully informed.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Vice-Chancellor is Dr. Snape, formerly Ma&s;ter of Eaton School near Wind&s;or; and famous for his Di&s;|pute with, and evident Advantage over the late Bi&s;hop of Bangor, in the time of his Government; the Di&s;pute between the Univer&s;ity and the Ma&s;ter of Trinity Colledge has been brought to a Head, &s;o as to employ the Pens of the learned on both &s;ides; but at la&s;t pro&s;ecuted in $ judicial Way, &s;o as to deprive Dr. Bent|$ey of all his Dignities and Offices in the Univer&s;ity; but the Doctor flying to the Royal Protection, the Univer&s;ity is under a Writ of Mandamus, to &s;hew Cau&s;e why they do not re&s;tore the Dr. again, to which it &s;eems they demur, and that Demur has not, that we hear, been argued, at lea&s;t when the&s;e Sheets were wrote; what will be the I&s;&s;ue Time mu&s;t &s;hew.</P>
<P>From Cambrdge the Road lies North We&s;t, on the Edge of the Fenns, to Huntingdon, where it joins the great North Road; on this &s;ide, 'tis all an agreeable Corn Country, as above; adorn'd with &s;everal Seats of Getlemen, but the Chief is the noble Hou&s;e, Seat, or Man&s;ion of Wimple, or Wimple Hall, formerly built at a va&s;t Expence, by the late Earl of Radnor; adorn'd with all the natural Beauties of Situation; and to which was added, all the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Contrivances which the be&s;t Heads could Invent, to make it artificially as well as naturally Plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>However, the Fate of the Radnor Family &s;o directing, it was bought, with the whole E&s;tate about it, by the late Duke of Newca&s;tle; in a Partition of who&s;e immen&s;e E&s;tate, it fell to the Right Honourable the Lord Harley, (Son and Heir apparent of the pre&s;ent Earl of Oxford and Mortimer) in Right of the Lady Harriot Cavendi&s;h, only Daughter of the &s;aid Duke of New|ca&s;tle, who is married to his Lord&s;hip, and brought him this E&s;tate, and many other, &s;ufficient to demon&s;trate her the riche&s;t Heire&s;s in great Britain.</P>
<P>Here his Lord&s;hip re&s;ides, and has already &s;o recommended him&s;elf to this Country, as to be, by a great Majority cho&s;en Knight of the Shire for the County of Cambridge.</P>
<P>From Cambridge, My De&s;ign obliging me, and the direct Road in part coacur|ing, I came back through the We&s;t part of the County of F&s;&s;ex, and at Saffron Walden I &s;aw the Ruins of the once large&s;t and mo&s;t magnifinent Pile in all this Part of England, viz. Audley End, built by, and decaying with, the noble Dukes and Earls of Suffolk.</P>
<P><PB REF="52" MS="Y">
A little North of this Part of the Country ri&s;es the River Stour, which, for a Cour&s;e of fifty Miles or more, parts the two Counties of Suffolk and E&s;|&s;$x; pa&s;&s;ing through or near Haveril, Clare, Cavendi&s;h, Hal&s;ted, Sudbury, Buers, Nayland, Stretford, Dedham, Man|ningtree, and into the Sea at Harwich; a&s;&s;i&s;ting by its Waters to make one of the be&s;t Harbours for Shipping that is in Great Britain: I mean Orwell Haven, or Harwich, of which I have &s;poken largely already.</P>
<P>As we came on this Side we &s;aw, at a Di&s;tance, Braintree and Bocking, two Towns, large, rich, and Populous, and made &s;o Originally by the Bay Trade, of which I have &s;poken at large at Col|che&s;ter, and which flouri&s;hes &s;till among them.</P>
<P>The Manor of Braintree I found de|&s;cended by Purcha&s;e, to the Name of Olmeus, the Son of a London Merchant of the &s;ame Name; making good what I had ob&s;erved before, of the great Num|ber of &s;uch who have purcha&s;ed E&s;tates in this County</P>
<P>Near this Town is Fel&s;ted, a &s;mall Place, but noted for a Free School, of an ancient Foundation, for many Years under the Ma&s;ter&s;hip of the late Reve|rend Mr. Lydiat, and brought by him to the Meridian of its Reputation: 'Tis now &s;upplied, and that very worthily, by the Reverend Mr Hutchins.</P>
<P>Near to this is the Priory of Lees, a delicious Seat of the late Duke of Man|che&s;ter, but Sold by the pre&s;ent Duke to the Duche&s;s Dowager of Bucks; his Grace the Duke of Manche&s;ter remov|ing to his yet finer Seat of Kimbol|ton iu Northampton&s;hire, the ancient Man&s;ion of the Family. From hence, keeping the London Road, I came to Chelmsford, mentioned before, and In|ger&s;tone, five Miles We&s;t, which I men|tion again; becau&s;e, in the Pari&s;h Church of this Town, are to be &s;een the ancient Monuments of the noble Family of Pe|tre, who&s;e Seat, and a large E&s;tate, lie in the Neigbourhood; and who&s;e whole Family, by a con&s;tant Series of Benefi|cent Actions to the Poor, and Bounty upon all charitable Occa&s;ions, have gain|ed an affectionate E&s;teem through all that Part of the Country, &s;uch as no preju|dice of Religion could wear out, or per|haps ever may; and I mu&s;t co$&s;els, I think, need not; for good and great Ac|tions command our re&s;pect let the Opi|nions of the Per&s;ons be otherwi&s;e what they will.</P>
<P>From hence we cro&s;s'd the Country to the great Fore&s;t, called Epping $span$ reaching almo&s;t to London, $span$ try that &s;ide of E&s;&s;ex is called the $word$ I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e there are no le&s;s than ten Towns almo&s;t together, called by the Name of Rooding, and is famous for good Land, good Malt and dirty Roads; the latter indeed, in the Winter, are &s;carce pa&s;&s;able for Hor&s;e or Man. In the mid&s;t of this we &s;ee Chipping On|ger, Hatfield Broad-Oak, Epping, and many Fore&s;t-Towns, fam'd, as I have &s;aid, for Husbandy and good Malt; but of no other Note. On the South-&s;ide of the County is Waltham-Abby; the Ruins of the Abby remain; and though Anti|quity is not my proper Bu&s;ine&s;s, I could not but ob&s;erve, that King Harold, &s;lain in the great Battle in Suffex, again&s;t William the Conqueror, lies buried here; his Bo|dy being begg'd by his Mother the Con|queror allow'd it to be carried hither; but no Monument was as I can find, built for him, only a flat Grave-&s;tone, on which was Engraven, <HI>Harold Infaelix.</HI></P>
<P>From hence I came over the Fore&s;t again, that is &s;o &s;ay, over the Lower or We&s;tern Part of it, where it is &s;pangled with fine Villages, and the&s;e Villages fill'd with fine Seats, mo&s;t of them built by the Citizens of London, as I ob&s;erved before; but the Lu&s;tre of them &s;eems to be entirely &s;wallow'd up in the magni|ficent Palace of the Lord Ca&s;tlemain, who&s;e Father, Sir Jo&s;iah Child, as it were, prepared it in his Life for the De|&s;ign of his Son, though altogether un|fore&s;een; by adding to the Advantage of its Situation innumerable rows of Trees, planted in rurious Order for Avenues and Vi&s;to's, to the Hou&s;e, all leading up to
<PB REF="53">
the Place where the old Hou&s;e &s;tood, as to a Center.</P>
<P>In the place adjoining, his Lord&s;hip, while he was Sir Richard Child only, and &s;ome Years before he began the Founda|tion of his New Hou&s;e, laid out the mo&s;t delicious as well as mo&s;t &s;pacious pieces of Ground for Gardens that is to be &s;een in all this part of England. The Green-Hou&s;e is an excellent Building fit to en|tertain a Prince; 'tis furni&s;h'd with Stoves and artificial Places for Heat from an Apartment, in which is a Bagnio, and other Conveniencies, which render it both u&s;eful and plea&s;ant; and the&s;e Gar|dens have been the ju&s;t Admiration of the World, that it has been the general Diver&s;ion of the Citizens to go out to &s;ee them, till the Crowds grew too great, and his Lord&s;hip was oblig'd to re&s;train his Serva$s from &s;hewing them, ex|cept on one or two Days in a Week only.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e is built &s;ince the&s;e Gar|dens have been fini&s;h'd: The Building is all of Portland Stone, in the Front, which makes it look extremely Glorious and magnificent at a di&s;tance; it being the particular property of that Stone, ex|cept in the Streets of London, where it is tainted and ting'd with the Smoak of the City, to grow Whiter and Whiter the longer it &s;tands in the open Air.</P>
<P>As the Front of the Hou&s;e opens to a long row of Trees, reaching to the great Road at Leighton-Stone; &s;o the Back-Face, or Front, if that be proper, re|&s;pects the Gardens, and with an ea&s;y De&s;cent lands you upon the Terras, from whence is a mo&s;t beautiful Pro|&s;pect to the River, which is all form'd into Canals and Openings, to an&s;wer the Views from above, and beyond the Ri|ver, the Walks and Wilderne&s;&s;es go on to &s;uch a Di&s;tance, and in &s;uch a manner up the Hill, as they before went down, that the Sight is lo&s;t in the Woods adjoining, and it looks all like one planted Garden as far as the Eye can &s;ee.</P>
<P>I &s;hall cover as much as po&s;&s;ible the melancholy part of a Story, which touches too &s;en&s;ibly, many, if not mo&s;t of the great and flouri&s;hing Families in England: Pity and matter of Grief it is, to think that Families, by E&s;tate, able to appear in &s;uch a glorious Po&s;ture as this, &s;hould ever be Vulnerable by &s;o mean a Di&s;a&s;ter as that of Stock-Jobbing: But the Gene|ral Infatuation of the Day is a Plea for it; &s;o that Men are not now blamed on that Account: South Sea was a general Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion; and if my Lord Ca&s;tlemain was wounded by that Arrow &s;hot in the Dark, 'twas a Misfortune: But 'tis &s;o much a Happine&s;s, that it was not a mortal wound, as it was to &s;ome Men, who once &s;eem'd as much out of the reach of it; and that Blow, be it what it will, is not remember'd for joy of the E&s;cape; for we &s;ee this noble Family, by Prudence and Management ri&s;e out of all that Cloud, if it may be allow d &s;uch a Name, and &s;hining in the &s;ame full Lu&s;ter as before.</P>
<P>This cannot be &s;aid of &s;ome other Fa|milies in this County, who&s;e fine Parks and new-built Palaces are fallen under Forfeitures and Alienations by the Mis|fortunes of tho&s;e Times, and by the Ruin of their Ma&s;ters Fortunes in that South Sea Deluge.</P>
<P>But I de&s;ire to throw a Veil over the&s;e Things, as they come in my way; 'tis enough that we write upon them as was written upon King Harold's Tomb at Waltham-Abbey, INFAELIX, and let all the re&s;t &s;leep among Things that are the fitte&s;t to be forgotten.</P>
<P>From my Lord Ca&s;tlemain's Hou&s;e, and the re&s;t of the fine Dwellings on that Side of the Fore&s;t, for there are &s;everal very good Hou&s;es at Wan&s;tead, only that they &s;eem all &s;wallow'd up in the Lu&s;ter of his Lord&s;hip's Palace; I &s;ay, from thence I went South, towards the great Road over that part of the Fore&s;t call'd the Flatts, where we &s;ee a very beau|tiful, but retired and rural Seat of Mr$ Lethulier's, elde&s;t Son of the late Sir John Lethulier, of Lu&s;um in Kent, of who&s;e Family I &s;hall &s;peak when I come on that Side.</P>
<P><PB REF="54" MS="Y">

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER travels, as I do, over England, and writes the Account of his Ob&s;ervations, will, as I noted before, always leave &s;omething, altering or undertaking, by &s;uch a growing, improving Nation as this; or &s;omething to di&s;cover in a Na|tion, where &s;o much is hid, &s;ufficient to employ the Pens of tho&s;e that come after him, or to add, by way of Appendix to what he has already ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>This is my Ca&s;e, with re&s;pect to the Particulars which follow: 1. Since the&s;e Sheets were in the Pre&s;s, a noble Palace of Mr. Walpole's, at pre&s;ent&punc; Fir&s;t Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, Privy-Coun|&s;ellor, &amp;c. to King George, is, as it were, ri&s;en out of the Ruins of the an|cient Seat of the Family of Walpole, at Houghton, about 8 Miles di&s;tant from Lynn, and on the North Coa&s;t of Nor|folk, near the Sea.</P>
<P>As the Hou&s;e is not yet fini&s;hed, and when I pa&s;s'd by it, was but newly de|&s;ign'd; it cannot be expected that I &s;hould be able to give a particular De&s;cription of what it will be: I can do little more than mention, that it appears already to be exceeding magnificent, and &s;uitable to the Genius of the Great Founder.</P>
<P>But a Friend of mine, who lives in that County, has &s;ent me the following Lines, which as he &s;ays, are to be plac'd upon the Building; whether on the Frize of the Corni&s;h, or over the Portico, or on what Part of the Build|ing of that I am not as yet certain: The In&s;cription is as follows, viz.</P>

<P>A &s;econd Thing proper to be added here, by way of Appendix, relates to what I have mention'd of the Port of London, being bounded by the Naze on the E&s;&s;ex Shore, and the North Fore|land on the Kenti&s;h Shore, which &s;ome People, guided by the pre&s;ent U&s;age of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, may pretend is not &s;o, to an&s;wer &s;uch Objectors: The true State of that Cau&s;e &s;tands thus.</P>
<P N="1"><Q>&startq;&endq;I. The Clau&s;e taken from the Act of Parliament e&s;tabli&s;hing the Extent of the Port of London, and publi&s;h'd, in &s;ome of the Books of Rates, is this:</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;To prevent all future Differences and Di&s;putes touching the Extent and Limits of the Port of London, the &s;aid Port is declared to extend, and be accounted, from the Promentary, or Point, call'd the North Foreland, in the I&s;le of Thanet, and from thence Northward, in a right Line, to the Point called the Naze, beyond the Gunfleet, upon the Coa&s;t of E&s;&s;ex; and &s;o continued We&s;tward through|out the River Thames, and the &s;eve|ral Chanels, Streams and Rivers fall|ing into it, to London Bridge; &s;aving

the u&s;ual and known Rights, Liber|ties and Priviledges of the Ports of Sandwich, and Ip&s;wich, and either of them, and the known Members there|of, and of the Cu&s;tomers, Comptro|lers, Searchers, and their Deputies, of and within the &s;aid Ports of Sandwich and Ip&s;wich, and the &s;everal Creeks, Harbours and Havens to them, or either of them, re&s;pectively belong|ing&punc; within the Counties of Kent and E&s;&s;ex.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Notwith&s;tanding what is above written, the Port of London, as in U&s;e &s;ince the &s;aid Order, is under&s;tood to reach no farther than Grave&s;end in Kent, and Tilbury Point in E&s;&s;ex&punc; and the Ports of Roche&s;ter, Milton, and Fever&s;ham, belong to the Port of Sandwich.</Q></P>
<Q>&startq;In like Manner the Ports of Har|wich, Colche&s;ter, Wevenhoe, Malden, Leigh, &amp;c. are &s;aid to be Members of the Port of Ip&s;wich.&endq;</Q>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation may &s;uffice for what is needful to be &s;aid upon the &s;ame Sub|ject, when I moy come to &s;peak of the Port of Sandwich, and its Members, and their Privileges, with re&s;pect to Ro|che&s;ter, Milton, Fever&s;ham, &amp;c. in my Circuit through the County of Kent.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY II.</HEAD>
<P>AS in my fir&s;t Journey I went o|ver the Ea&s;tern Counties of Eng|land, viz. E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk, Nor|folk, and Cambridge, and took Cour&s;e on that Side the River Thames, to view the Sea-coa&s;ts Harbours, &amp;c. &s;o being now to travel the Southern Counties, I begin the other &s;ide of the Thames, and &s;hall &s;urround the Sea|coa&s;t of Kent, as I did that of Norfolk, Suffolk, and perhaps it is as fruitful of In&s;tructing and Diverting Ob&s;ervations as any of the other.</P>
<P>I took Boat at Tower Wharf, &s;ending my Hor&s;es round by Land to meet me at Greenwich, that I might $ begin my Journey at the beginning of the County, $nd here I had the Advantage of making my fir&s;t Step into the County of Kent, which is the mo&s;t delightful Spot of Ground in Great Britain; Plea&s;ant by Si|$uation, tho&s;e Plea&s;ures encrea&s;s'd by Art, and all made compleatly agreeable $y the accident of fine Buildings, the $ontinual pa&s;&s;ing Fleets of Ships up and $own the mo&s;t beautiful River in Europe; the be&s;t Air, be&s;t Pro&s;pect, and the be&s;t Conver&s;ation in England.</P>
<P>The Royal Ho&s;pital for Seamen, tho' not yet fini&s;hed; the Park, the Queen's Hou&s;e, the Ob&s;ervatory on the Hill, com|monly called Dr. Halley's Hou&s;e, are all things &s;o well known, they need no par|ticular De&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Ground, part of this Ho&s;pital now &s;tands upon, and is to &s;tand upon, is the &s;ame on which formerly &s;tood the Royal Palace of our Kings. Here Hen|ry VIII held his Royal Fea&s;ts with Jou&s;ts and Tournaments; and the Ground which was called toe Tilt-Yard, is the Spot on which the Ea&s;termo&s;t Wieg of the Ho&s;pital is built; the Park &punc;for it was even then a Park al&s;o was enlarg'd, wall'd about, and planted with beauti|ful Rows, or Walks of Trees by King Charles II. &s;oon after the Re&s;toration; and the De&s;ign or Plan of a Royal Pa|lace was then laid out, one Wing of which was fini&s;hed and covered, in a mo&s;t magnificent Manner, and makes now the fir&s;t Wing of the Ho&s;pital as
<PB REF="56" MS="Y">
you come to it from London: The Build|ing is regular, the lower Part a &s;trong Dorick, the middle Part a mo&s;t beautiful Corinthian, with an Attick above all, to compleat the Height; the Front to the Water-&s;ide is exteramly Magnificent and Graceful; embelli&s;hed with rich carved Work and fine Devices, &s;uch as will hardly be outdone in this, or any Age, for Beauty or Art.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t be very ignorant of our Engli&s;h Affairs, who have publi&s;h'd very lately that Queen Elizabeth built the Royal Palace of Greenwich; whereas it is evident, that it was the Palace of K. Henry VIII. her Father, before &s;he was Born; and this is prov'd beyond Con|tradiction by this particular Circum|&s;tance, that her Maje&s;ty was Born in this very Palace which &s;he is there &s;aid to have built.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of Greenwich is owing to the Lu&s;ter of its Inhabitants, where there is a kind of Collection of Gentle|men, rather than Citizens, and of Per&s;ons of Quality and Fa&s;hion, different from mo&s;t, if not all, the Villages in this Part of England.</P>
<P>Here &s;everal of the mo&s;t active and u&s;eful Gentlemen of the late Armies, after having grown Old in the Service of their Country, and covered with the Honours of the Field, are retired to en|joy the remainder of their Time, and reflect with Plea&s;ure upon the Dangers t$ey have gone through, and the faithful Services they have performed both A|broad and at Home.</P>
<P>Several Generals, and &s;everal of the inferior Officers, I &s;ay, having thus cho|&s;en this calm Retreat, live here in as much Honour and Delight as this World can give.</P>
<P>Other Gentlemen &s;till in Service, as in the Navy, Ordnance, Docks, Yards, &amp;c. as well while in Bu&s;ine&s;s, as after laying down their Employments, have here planted them&s;elves, in&s;omuch, that the Town of Greenwich begins to out-&s;well its Bounds, and extends it&s;elf not only on this &s;ide the Park to the Top of the Heath, by the way call'd Crump-Hill, but now &s;tretches out on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, where Sir John Vanbrug has built a Hou&s;e Ca|&s;tle-wi&s;e, and where in a little time 'tis probable, &s;everal Streets of like Buildings will be erected, to the enlarging and beautifying the Town, and encrea&s;ing the Inhabitants; who, as I have &s;aid, are already the chief Beauty and Ornament of the Place: We are told al&s;o, that Leave will be obtained to build a new Church on that &s;ide; the Parti&s;h-Church, though new rebuilt&punc; and very large and beautiful, not being &s;ufficient to receive the Inhabitants, much le&s;s will it be &s;o, if the Buildings go on to encrea&s;e; as they have done, and as they now &s;eem to do.</P>
<P>The River of Thames is here very broad, and the Chanel deep, and the Water, at &s;ome very high Spring Tides is Salt; but in Ordinary Tides, is very &s;weet and fre&s;h, e&s;pecially at the Tide of Ebb.</P>
<P>The Country behind Greenwich adds to the Plea&s;ure of the Place: Black-Heath both for Beauty of Situation, and an ex|cellent Air, is not out-done by any &s;pot of Ground &s;o near the River and &s;o near Land in England</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t-&s;ide &s;tands an Ho&s;pital ve|ry particular for its Foundation or De|&s;ign, though through the Misfortunes o$ the Times, the Generous De&s;ign of th$ Founder has been much &s;traiten'd, an$ in great part defeated.</P>
<P>It was built by Sir John Morden, $word$ Turkey Merchant of London, wh$ lived in a great Hou&s;e at the going o$ from the Heath, a litle South of th Ho&s;pital on the Road to Eltham; hi fir&s;t De&s;ign, as I had it from his ow Mouth the Year before he began $ build, was to make Apartments for fort decay'd Merchants, to whom he re&s;ol$|ed to allow 40 l. per Annum each; wit Coals, a Gown (and Servants to loo after their Apartments) and many oth$ Conveniencies, &s;o as to make their Liv$ as comfortable as po&s;&s;ible, and that, $word$ they had liv'd like Gentlemen, they mig$ dye &s;o.</P>
<P><PB REF="57">
Sir John Morden and his Lady lie bu|ried in a Vault in the Chancel of the Chapel of this Ho&s;pital: The Chapel is a very great Building facing the Entrance into the Courrt: The Lodgings for the Merchants, are on either &s;ide; two A|partments in each Stai$-Ca&s;e, with Cel|lars for their Conveni$ncies, Coals, Beer, &#38;$. and each Apartment con&s;i&s;ts of a Bed-Chamber and a Study, or large $word$ for their Retreat, and to divert $word$ in with Books, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They have a Publ$ck Kitchen, a Hall to Dine in, and over the Hall is a large Room for the Tru&s;tees (who manage the whole) to meet in; there is al&s;o a very good Apartment for the Chaplain, who&s;e Salary is 50l. a Year; there are al&s;o Dwellings for the Cooks, Butlers, Por|ter, the Women and other Servants, and rea&s;onable Salaries allow'd them: And behind the Chapel is a hand&s;ome Burying-Ground wall'd in; there are al&s;o very good Gardens; in a Word, it is the no|ble&s;t Foundation, and mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;ingle Piece of Charity that has been erected in England &s;ince Sutton's Ho&s;pital in London: I call it &s;ingle, becau&s;e it has been built and endow'd by one &s;ingle Hand; the Situation is very plea&s;ant, and the Air very Healthy and Good.</P>
<P>There is erected over the Gate, &s;ince Sir John's Death, his Statue in Stone, &s;et up by his Lady, and &s;ince her Death, her own is &s;et up near it, by the Tru&s;tees; &s;he having been a Benefactre&s;s to the Foundation many Ways &s;ince his Decea&s;e</P>
<P>There is a Velvet Pall given, by her Lady&s;hip in particular, to be laid up in the Chapel for the U&s;e of the Gentlemen; as al&s;o a large Quantity of Communion-Plate, and the Chaplain is oblig'd to read Prayers twice every Day, viz. At Eleven a Clock, and at Three; at which all the Pen&s;ioners are oblig'd to attend.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the Heath, North# is Charleton, a Village famous, $r rather infamous, for that yearly col|$ected Rabble of Mad-People, at Horn-Fair; the Rudene&s;s of which I cannot but think, is &s;uch as ought to be &s;up|pre&s;s'd, and indeed in a civiliz'd well govern'd Nation, it may well be &s;aid to be un&s;ufferable. The Mob indeed at that Time take all kinds of Liberties, and the Women are e&s;pecially Impuden$ for that Day; as if it was a Day that ju&s;ti|fy'd the giving them&s;elves a Loo&s;e to all manner of Indecency and Immode&s;ty, without any Reproach, or without &s;uf|fering the Cen&s;ure which &s;u$h Behaviour would de&s;erve, at another Time.</P>
<P>Th$ Introduction of this rude A&s;&s;embly or the Occa&s;ion of it, I can meet with very little A count of, in Antiquity; and $word$ recommend i$ to the pvblick Ju&s;|ti e to be &s;uppre&s;s'd, as a Nu&s;ance and Offence to all &s;ober People&punc; than to &s;pend any Time to enquire into its Original.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome very good Hou&s;es late+ly built in this Town, and abating the Rabble and Hurry of the 19th of Octo|ber as above, 'tis indeed a very plea&s;ant Village, &s;tanding on the Top of a nigh Hill, yet &s;helter'd on one Side by Shoot|er's-Hill, which is much higher, and on the other Side, over-looking the Mar&s;hes and the River Thames, on which it has a very agreeable Pro&s;pect from London almo&s;t to Grave&s;end.</P>
<P>Thro' this Town lies the Road of Woolwich, a Town on the Bank to the &s;ame River, wholly taken up by, and in a manner rai&s;ed from, the Ya$ds and publick Works, erected there for the publick Service. Here, when the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Royal Navy en$rea&s;ed, and Queen Elizabeth built larger and greater Ships of War than were u&s;ually employ'd before, new Docks and Launches were erected, and Places prepared, for the building and repair|ing Ships of the large&s;t Size; becau&s;e, as here was a greater Depth of Water and a freer Channel than at Deptford,; (where the chief Yard in the River of Thames was before) &s;o there was le&s;s Ha|zard in the great Ships going up and
<PB REF="58" MS="Y">
down; the Crowd of Merchant-Ships at Deptford, being always &s;uch, as that it could not be &s;o &s;afe to come up thither, as to put in at Woolwich.</P>
<P>At this Dock the Royal Sovereign was built, once the large&s;t Ship in the whole Royal Navy, and in particular e&s;teem'd, for &s;o large a Ship, the be&s;t Sailor in the World. Here al&s;o was rebuilt the Royal Prince, now call'd the Queen, a Fir&s;t Rate, carrying a hundred Guns, and &s;everal others: Clo&s;e under the South Shore from the We&s;t End of Woolwich, the Thames is very deep, and the Men of War lie there moor'd, and as we call it, laid up; their Top-ma&s;ts and all their &s;mall Rigging taken down and laid in Warehou&s;es; this reaches as high as the Point over-again&s;t Bow River, and is call'd Bugby's Hole.</P>
<P>The Docks, Yards, and all the Build|ings belonging to it, are encompa&s;&s;ed with a high Wall, and are exceeding &s;pacious and convenient; and are al&s;o prodigious full of all manner of Stores of Timber, Plank, Ma&s;ts, Pitch, Tar, and all manner of Naval Provi&s;ions to &s;uch a Degree, as is &s;carce to be calcu|lated.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Building-Yards, here is a large Rope-Walk, where the bigge&s;t Ca|bles are made for the Men of War; and on the Ea&s;t or lower Part of the Town is the Gun-yard or Place &s;et apart for the great Guns belonging to the Ships, com|monly call'd the Park, or the Gun-Park; where is a prodigious Quantity of all manner of Ordnance-Stores, &s;uch as are fit for Sea-Service, that is to &s;ay, Cannon of all &s;orts for the Ships of War, every Ship's Guns by them&s;elves; heavy Can|non for Batteries, and Mortars of all Sorts and Sizes; in&s;omuch that, as I was inform'd, here has been &s;ometimes laid up at one time between &s;even and eight Thou&s;and Pieces of Ordnance, be&s;ides Mortars and Shells without Number.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o is the Hou&s;e where the Firemen and Engineers prepare their Fireworks, charge Bombs, Carca&s;&s;es, and Grenades for the publick Service, in time of War; and here, (if I remem|ber right, it was, in the time of a Dutch War) by Mi&s;chance, the Fire in their Lab'ratory took hold of &s;ome Combu$$i|bles, which &s;preading, fir'd fir&s;t a Bomb or Shell, and the bur&s;ting of that $word$ blew up all the Works with &s;uch a $span$ Bla&s;t and Noi&s;e, as $span$ &s;hatter'd the Town of Woolwich $span$ in pieces, and terrify'd the $span$ la&s;t degree, but kill'd no $span$ heard of, except about Eleven $span$ were in or near the Fireworking $span$ where it fir&s;t took hold.</P>
<P>In this Park, clo&s;e on the South $span$ of the River, a large Battery of $span$ Pieces of heavy Cannon was $span$ have &s;aluted the Dutch, if they $span$ thought fit to have ventur'd up the $word$ in 1667. as was given out they would when they burnt our Ships at Cha$ham; and large Furnaces and Forges were ere$|ted to have furni&s;h'd the Gunners with red hot Bullets for that Service; but the Dutch had no De&s;ign that way, and did their Bu&s;ine&s;s with far le&s;s Hazard, and as much to our Di&s;grace in another Place.</P>
<P>Here is u&s;ually a Guard&s;hip Riding, e&s;pecially in time of Service; al&s;o here is a large Hulk made of the Carca&s;s of an old Man of War, &s;ufficiently large for &s;etting the Ma&s;ts of the bigge&s;t Ships in the Navy. The Thames is here at high Water near a Mile over, and the Water Salt upon the Flood; and as the Channel l$es &s;trait Ea&s;t and We&s;t for a|bout Three Miles, the Tide runs very &s;trong; 'tis entirely free from Shoals and Sands, and has &s;even or eight Fathom Water&punc; &s;o that the bigge&s;t Ships, and a great many of them, might ride here with &s;afety even at low Water.</P>
<P>From this Town there is little remark|able upon the River, till we come to Grave&s;end&punc; the whole Shore being low, and &s;pread with Mar&s;hes and unhealthy Grounds, except with &s;mall intervals, where the land bends inward as at Erith, Greenhith, North Fleet, &amp;c. in which pla|ces the Chalk Hills come clo&s;e to the River
<PB REF="59">
and from thence the City of London, the adjacent Counties, and, even Hol|land and Flanders, are &s;upply'd with Lime for their Building, or Chalk to make Lime, and for other U&s;es.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Chalky Cliff&punc; on the River &s;ide, the Rubbi&s;h of the Chalk, which crumbles away when they dig the larger Chalk for Lime or, (as we might call it) the Chips of the Chalk, and which they mu&s;t be at the Charge of removing to be out of their way is bought and fetch d away by Lighters and Hoys, and carry'd to all the Ports and Creeks in the oppo&s;ite County of E&s;&s;ex&punc; and even to Suffolk and Norfolk, and &s;old there o the Country Farmers to lay up|on their Land, and that in prodigious $word$; and &s;o it is valued by the farmers of tho&s;e Counties, that they not only give from two Shillings and &s;ix Pence, to four Shillings a Load for it, according to the Di&s;tance the Place is from the &s;aid Chalk Cliffs; but they fetch it by Land Carriage Ten Miles, nay Fifteen Miles up into the Country.</P>
<P>This is the Practice in all-the Creeks and Rivers in E&s;&s;ex, even to Malden, Colche&s;ter, the Na&s;e, and into Har|wich Harbour up to Maningtree, and to Ip&s;wich; as al&s;o in Suffolk, to Albro', Orford, Dunwich, Swold, and as high as Yarmouth in Norfolk.</P>
<P>Thus the barren Soil of Kent, for &s;uch the Chalky Grounds are e&s;teemed, make the E&s;&s;ex Lands Rich and Fruitful, and the mixture of Earth fooms a Compo&s;i|tion, which, out of two barren Ex|treams, makes one prolifick Medium; the &s;trong Clay of E&s;&s;ex and Suffolk is made Fruitful by the &s;oft meliorating melting Chalk of Kent, which fattens and enriches it.</P>
<P>On the back-&s;ide of the&s;e Mar&s;hy-Grounds in Kent, at a &s;mall Di&s;tance, lies the Road from London to Dover, and on that Highway, or near it, &s;eve|ral good Towns; for Example, Eltham, formerly a Royal Palace, when the Court was kept at Greenwich; and Queen $word$ who (as before) was Born at $span$ was often carry'd, as they &s;ay, to Eltham by her Nur&s;es, to &s;uck in the whole&s;ome Air of that agreeable Place; but at pre&s;ent there are few or no Signs of the old Palace to be &s;een.</P>
<P>It is now a plea&s;ant Town, very hand|&s;omely built, full of good Hou&s;es; and many Families of rich Citizens inhabit here: (As I ob&s;erv'd of the Villages ad|jacent to London in other Counties) So it is here, they bring a gre t deal of good Company with them: Al&s;o, abun|dance of Ladies of very good Fortunes dwell here, and one &s;ees at the Church &s;uch an Appearance of the Sex, as is &s;urprizing; but 'tis complain'd of, that the Youths of the&s;e Families where tho&s;e Beauties grow, are &s;o generally o$ almo&s;t univer&s;ally bred Abroad, either in Tur|key, Italy, or Spain, as Merchants, or in the Army or Court as Gentlemen; that for the Ladies to live at Eltham, is, as it were, to live Reclu&s;e, and out of Sight; &s;ince to be kept where the Gentlemen do not come, is all one as to be kept where they cannot come. This they &s;ay threatens Eltham with a fatal Turn, un|le&s;s the Scene alters in a few Years, and they tell us, that all the Ladies will aban|don the Place.</P>
<P>In the Neighbourhood of this Place at Lu&s;um, Sir John Lethulier, a Turkey Merchant, liv'd for many Years, and to a great Age, and has e&s;tabli&s;h'd his Fa|mily in the &s;eparate Hou&s;es of three or four &s;everal Sons, to all which he has left plentiful E&s;tates in this Country, but e&s;pecially in E&s;&s;ex, where his elde&s;t Son has a very noble Seat, and E&s;tate near Barking.</P>
<P>From this Side of the Country, all plea&s;ant and gay, we go over Shooter's-Hill where the Face of the World &s;eems quite alter'd; for here we have but a Chalky Soil and indifferently Fruitful, far from Rich; much overgrown with Wood, e&s;pecially Coppice-Wood, which is cut for Faggots and Bavins, and &s;ent up by Water to London. Here they make tho&s;e Faggots which the Wood-mongers call O&s;trey-Wood, and here in particular tho&s;e &s;mall light Bavins which are u&s;ed in Taverns in London to light
<PB REF="60" MS="Y">
their Faggots, and are call'd in the Ta|verns a Bru&s;h, the Wood-men call them Pimps; 'tis incredible what va&s;t Quanti|ties of the&s;e are lay'd up at Woolwich, Erith, and Dartford; but &s;ince the Ta|verns in London are come to make Coal-Fires in their Upper Rooms, that Cheat of a Trade declines; and tho' that Ar|ti$le would &s;eem to be trifling in it&s;elf, 'tis not trifling to ob&s;erve what an Altera|tion it makes in the Value of tho&s;e We $word$ in $ent, and how many more of them than u&s;ual are yearly $iubb'd up, and the Land made $word$ for the Plow.</P>
<P>As I pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;aw Grave&s;end from the Hills, but having been often in the Town, I know enough to be able to &s;ay, that there is nothing con&s;iderable in it; except fir&s;t that it is the Town where the great Ferry (as they call it) is kept up between London and Ea&s;t Kent: It is hardly credible what Numbers of People pa&s;s here every Tide, as well by Night as by Day, between this Town and Lon|don: Almo&s;t all the People of Ea&s;t Kent, when they go for London, go no farther by Land than this Town, and then for Six-pence in the Tilt-Boat, or One Shilling in a &s;mall Boat or Wherry, are carried to London by Water.</P>
<P>About 25 Years ago one of the&s;e Tilt-Boats was ca&s;t away, occa&s;ion'd by the de&s;perate Ob&s;tinaey and Rudene&s;s of the Steer&s;man, or Ma&s;ter, as they call him, who would tack again, and &s;tand over upon a Wind, in the Reach call'd Long-Reach, contrary to the Advice and In|treaties, not of the Pa&s;&s;engers only, but of his own Rowers, who told him it blew a Storm, and &s;he would founder; but he call'd them Fools, bid the Wind Blow Devil, (a rude Sailor's Proverb) the more Wind the better Boat, till com|ing into the Channel where the Sea ran very high, he took in a Wave, or a Sea, as they call it, which run her down, and founder'd her, as was foretold; and him|&s;elf and three and fifty Pa&s;&s;engers were all drown'd, only about five e&s;caping by Swimming.</P>
<P>The other Thing for which this Town is worth Notice, is, that all the Ships which go to Sea from London, take, as we &s;ay, their Departure from hence; for here all Outward-bound Ships mu&s;t &s;top, come to an Anchor, and &s;uffer what they call a &s;econd Clearing, (viz.) Here a Searcher of the Cu&s;toms comes on board, looks over all the Coquets or Entries of the Cargo, and may, if he plea&s;es, rum|mage the whole Loading, to &s;ee if there are no more Goods than are enter'd which however they &s;eldom do, tho' they forget not to take a Compliment for their Civility, and, be&s;ides being well treated on Board, have generally three or five Guns fir'd in Honour to them when they go off.</P>
<P>The Method of cau&s;ing all Ships to &s;top here before they go, is worth ob|&s;erving, and is as follows:</P>
<P>When a Merchant-Ship comes down from London, (if they have the Tide of Ebb under Foot, or a fre&s;h Gale of Wind from the We&s;t, &s;o that they have, what they call Fre&s;h-Way, and the Ships come down apace,) they generally hand &s;ome of their Sails, haul up a Fore-Sail or Main Sail, or lower the Fore-Top-Sail, &s;o to &s;lacken her Way, as &s;oon as they come to the Old Man's Head; when they open the Reach, which they call Grave&s;end Reach which begins about a Mile and Half above the Town, they do the like, to &s;ignify that they intend to bring too, as the Sailors call it, and come to an Anchor.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they come among the Ships that are riding in the Road, (as there are always a great many) the Centinel at the Block-Hou&s;e, as they call it, on Grave&s;|end Side, fires his Musket, which is to tell the Pilot he mu&s;t bring too; if he comes on, as &s;oon as the Ship pa&s;&s;es B$oad-&s;ide with the Block-Hou&s;e, the Centinel fires again, which is as much as to &s;ay, why don't you bring too? If he drives a little farther, he fires a third Time, and the Language of that is, Bring too immediately, and let go your Anchor, or We will make you.</P>
<P>If the Ship continues to drive down, and does not let go her Anchor, the Gunner of the Fort is fetch'd, and he
<PB REF="61" MS="Y">
fi$$s a Piece of Cannon tho' without Ball; and that is &s;till a Threat, tho' with &s;ome Patience, and is to &s;ay, Will you come $o an Anchor or won't you? If he &s;till ventures to go on, by which he gives them to under&s;tand he intends to run for it; then the Gunner fires again, and with a Shot, and that Shot is a $ignal to the Fortre&s;s over the River, viz. Tilbury Fort, which I de&s;cribed in my Account of E&s;&s;ex) and they immediately let fly at the Ship from the Guns on the Ea&s;t Ba|&s;tion; and after from all the Guns they can being to bear upon her; it is very &s;eldom that a Ship will venture their Shot becau&s;e they can reach her all the way unto the Hope&punc; and round to Hope-Point almo&s;t to Hole-Haven.</P>
<P>Yet I happen'd once to be upon the Shore ju&s;t by Tilbury Fort, when a Ship ventu$$d to run off in &s;pite of all tho&s;e Fireings; and it being ju&s;t at the fir&s;t Shoot of the Ebb, and when a great Fleet of light Colliers and other Ships were under Sail too; by that time, the Ship e&s;caping came round the Hope-Point, &s;he was &s;o hid among the other Ships, that the Gunners on the Ba&s;tion hardly knew who to &s;hoot at; upon which they Mann'd out &s;everal Boats with Soldiers, in hopes to overtake her, or to make Signals to &s;ome Men of War at the Nore, to Man out their Boats, and &s;top her, but &s;he laugh'd at them all; for as it blew a fre&s;h Gale of Wind at South We&s;t, and a Tide of Ebb &s;trong under her Foot, &s;he went three Foot for their one, and by that time the Boats got down to Hole-Haven, the Ship was beyond the Nore, and as it grew Dar$, they &s;oon lo&s;t Sight of her, nor could they ever hear to this Day what &s;hip it was, or on what Account &s;he ventur'd to run &s;uch a Ri&s;que.</P>
<P>Another time I was with &s;ome Mer|chants in a large Yacht, bound to France; they had a great Quantity of Block Tin $word$ $span$ other Goods, which had not been enter'd at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; and the Ma&s;ter or Captain told us, he $word$ not $word$ but he would pa&s;s by $span$ coming to $word$ $word$ he lay, when this Thought came into his Head, at an Anchor in Gray&punc;s Reach, ju&s;t above the Old Man's Head, men|tion'd above, which is a Point or Head of Land on the $&s;&s;ex Shore, which makes the bottom of Gray's Reach, and the up|per End of Grave&s;end Reach: He ob|&s;erv'd that the Mornings were likely to be exceeding Foggy; particularly on the Morning next after his Re&s;olution of trying there was &s;o thick a Fog, that it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee from the Main-Ma&s;t to the Bow&s;prit, even of a Hoy; is being High-water, he re&s;olv'd to weigh a$d $ive, as he call'd it, and &s;o he did: $word$ he came among the other Ships a$d over again&s;t the Town, his greate&s;t Danger was running foul of them, to prevent which he kept a Man lying on his Belly at the Bow&s;prit End, to look out, and &s;o tho' not without &s;ome Danger too, he went clear: As for Grave&s;end or Tilbury Fort, they could &s;ee no more of us than they could of London-Bridge; and we drove in this Fog undi&s;cern'd by the Forts or Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Men, as low as Hole-Haven, and went afterwards clear away for Caen in Normandy without being vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>But &s;uch attempts as the&s;e, are what would very hardly be brought to pa&s;s again now, nor is the Ri&s;que worth any body's running if the value be con&s;ide|rable that may be lo&s;t; and therefore one may venture to &s;ay, that all the Ships which go out of the River from London, are fir&s;t cleared here, even the empty Col|liers and Coa&s;ters go on &s;hore, and give an Account who they are, and take a Signal from the Cu&s;tom hou&s;e Office and pay Sixpence, and then pa&s;s on: As for Ships coming in, they all go by here without any notice taken of them, unle&s;s it be to put Waiters on board them, if they are not &s;upply'd before.</P>
<P>From Grave&s;end we &s;ee nothing re|markable on the Road but Gad's Hill, a noted Place for robbing of Seamen after they have receiv'd their pay $t Chatham. Here it was that Famous Robbery

was committed in the Year 1676, or thereabouts; it was about Four a Clock in the Morning when a Gentleman was robb'd by one Nicks on a Bay Mare, ju&s;t on the declining part of the Hill, on the We&s;t &s;ide, for he &s;wore to the Spot and to the Man; Mr. Nicks, who rob|bed him, came away to Grave&s;end, im|mediately ferry'd over, and, as he &s;aid, was &s;top'd by the difficulty of the Boat, and of the Pa&s;&s;age, near an Hour; which was a great di&s;couragement to him, but was a kind of Bait to his Hor&s;e: From thence he rode cro&s;s the County of E&s;&s;ex, thro' Tilbury, Hornden, and Bilerecay to Chelmsford: Here he &s;topp'd about half an Hour to refre&s;h his Hor&s;e, and gave him &s;ome Balls; from thence to Braintre, Bocking, Wethersfield; then over the Downs to Cambridge, and from thence keeping &s;till the cro&s;s Roads, he went by Fenny Stanton to Godmanche&s;ter and Huntington, where he baited him&s;elf and his Mare about an Hour; and, as he &s;aid him&s;elf, &s;lept about half an Hour, then holding on the North Road, and keeping a full large Gallop mo&s;t of that way, he came to York the &s;ame After|noon; put off his Boots and riding Cloths, and went dre&s;s'd as if he had been an Inhabitant of the Place, not a Traveller, to the Bowling Green, where among other Gentlemen was the Lord Mayor of the City; he &s;ingling out his Lord&s;hip, &s;tudied to do &s;omething particular that the Mayor might remember him by, and accordingly lays &s;ome odd Bett with him concerning the Bowls then running, which &s;hould cau&s;e the Mayor to remember it the more particularly; and then takes Occa&s;ion to ask his Lord&s;hip what a Clock it was&punc; who pulling out his Watch, told him the Hour, which was a quarter be|fore, or a quarter after Eight at Night.</P>
<P>Some other Circum&s;tances it &s;eems he carefully brought into their Di&s;cour&s;e, which &s;hould make the Lord Mayor re|member the Day of the Month exactly, as well as the Hour of the Day.</P>
<P>Upon a Pro&s;ecution which happen'd afterwards for this Robbery, the whole Merit of the Ca&s;e turn'd upon this &s;ingle Point: The Per&s;on robb'd &s;wore as above to the Man, to the Place, and to the Time, in which the Fact $word$ committed: Namely, That he was $span$ on Gad's Hill in Kent, on &s;uch a $word$ and at &s;uch a Time of the Day, and $word$ &s;uch a Part of the Hill, and that the Pri&s;on|er at the Bar was the Man that $span$ him: Nicks, the Pri&s;oner de$$$ the Fact, call'd &s;everal Per&s;ons to $word$ Reputation, alledg'd that he was as $word$ off as York&s;hire at that Time, and $word$ particularly the Day whereon the Pro|&s;ecutor &s;wore he was robb'd, $word$ was at Bowls on the publick $word$ in the City of York; and to $word$ this, he produced the Lord Mayor York to te&s;tify that he was &s;o, a$d he the Mayor acted &s;o and &s;o $word$ there as above.</P>
<P>This was &s;o po&s;itive, and &s;o $span$ te&s;ted, that the Jury acquitted $span$ a bare Suppo&s;ition, that it was $word$ the Man could be at two Places &s;o remote on one and the &s;ame day. There are more Particulars related of this Story, &s;uch as I do not take upon me to af|firm; namely, That King Charles II. pre|vailed on him on A&s;&s;urance of Pardon, and that he &s;hould not be brought into any farther Trouble about it, to confe&s;s the Truth to him privately, and that he own'd to his Maje&s;ty that he com|mitted the Robbery, and how he rode the Journey after it, and that upon this the King gave him the Name or Title of Swift Nicks, in&s;tead of Nicks; but the&s;e Things, I &s;ay, I do not relate as certain: I return to the Bu&s;ine&s;s in Hand.</P>
<P>From Gad's Hill we come to Roche|&s;ter Bridge the large&s;t, the highe&s;t, and the &s;tronge&s;t built of all the Bridges in England, except London Bridge; &s;ome in|deed &s;ay, the Bridge of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, exceeds all the Bridges in England for &s;trength; $and it is indeed very firm and wide, and has a Street of Hou|&s;es upon it like London-Bridge, and a Gate in the middle as large as a little Ca&s;tle, of which in its Place; but then it is neither &s;o high nor &s;o long as this Bridge at Roche&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB REF="65" MS="Y">
Roche&s;ter, Stroud, and Chatham, are three di&s;tinct Places, but Contiguous, except the Interval of the River be|tween the two fir&s;t, and a very &s;mall Mar&s;h of Vacancy between Roche&s;ter and Chatham.</P>
<P>There is little remarkable in Roche|&s;ter, except the Ruins of a very old Ca&s;tle, and an ancient, but not extra|ordinary Cathedral; but the River, and its Appendices, are the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble of the kind in the World. This be|ing the chief Ar&s;enal of the Royal Na|vy of Great Britain. The Buildings here are indeed like the Ships them|&s;elves, &s;urpri&s;ingly large, and in their &s;everal kinds Beautiful: The Ware-Hou|&s;es, or rather Streets of Ware-Hou&s;es, and Store Hou&s;es for laying up the Na|val Trea&s;ures, are the large&s;t in Dimen|&s;ion, and the mo&s;t in Number that are any where to be &s;een in the World: The Rope-Walks for making Cables, and the Forges for Anchors, and other Iron Work, bear a Proportion to the re&s;t; as al&s;o the Wet-Dock for keeping Ma&s;ts and Yards of the greate&s;t Size, where they lie &s;unk in the Water to pre|&s;erve them; the Boat-Yard, the Anchor-Yard; all like the whole mon&s;trou&s;ly great and exten&s;ive, and are not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>We come next to the Stores them|&s;elves, for which all this Provi&s;ion is made; and fir&s;t, To begin with the Ships that are laid up there: The Sails, the Rigging, the Ammunition, Guns, great and &s;mall Shot, &s;mall Arms, Swords, Cutla&s;&s;es, Half-Pikes, with all the other Furniture belonging to the Ships that Ride at their Moorings in the River Medway: The&s;e take up one Part of the Place, having &s;eparate Buildings, and Store-Hou&s;es appropriated to them, where the Furniture of every Ship lies in particular Ware-Hou&s;es by them&s;elves, and may be taken out on the mo&s;t ha&s;ty Occa&s;ion without Confu&s;ion, Fire ex|cepted</P>
<P>N. B. The Powder is generally car|ry'd away to particular Magazins, to a|void Di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are Store-Hou&s;es for laying up the Furniture, and Stores for Ships; but which are not appropri|ated, or do not belong (as it is expre&s;|&s;ed by the Officers) to any particular Ship, but lie ready to be delivered out for the Furni&s;hing other Ships to be Built, or for Repairing and Supplying the Ships already there, as Occa&s;ion may require.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e there are &s;eparate and re&s;pective Magazines of Pitch, Tarr, Hemp, Flax, Tow, Ro&s;in, Oyl, Tallow; al&s;o of Sail Cloth, Canvas, Anchors, Cables, Standing and Running Rigging, ready fitted, and Cordage not fitted; with all kinds of Ship Chandlery Ne|ce&s;&s;aries, &s;uch as Blocks, Tackles, Run|ners, &amp;c. with the Cooks, Boat&s;wains, and Gunners Stores, and al&s;o Anchors of all &s;izes, Grapnells, Chains, Bolts, and Spikes, Wrought and Unwrought Iron, Ca&s;t Iron Work, &s;uch as Potts, Caldrons, Furnaces, &amp;c. al&s;o Boats, Spare Ma&s;ts and Yards; with a great Quan ity of Lead, and Nails, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, (too many to be enumerated) who&s;e Store looks as if it were inexhau&s;tble.</P>
<P>To ob&s;erve the&s;e Things deliberately, one would almo&s;t wonder what Ships they were, and where they &s;hould be found, which could either for Building, or Repairing, Fitting, or Refitting, call for &s;uch a Quantity of all tho&s;e Things; but when, on the other hand, one fees the Ships, and con&s;iders their Dimen&s;i|on and con&s;equently the Dimen&s;ion of all Things which belong to them; how Large, how Strong every Thing mu&s;t be; how much of the Material, mu&s;t go to the making every Thing propor|tionable to the Occa&s;ion, the Wonder would change its Pro&s;pect, and one would be as much amaz'd to think how, and where, they &s;hould be &s;upply'd.</P>
<P>The particular Government of the&s;e Yards, as they are called, is very Re|markable, the Commi&s;&s;ioners, Clerks, Accomptants, &amp;c. Within Doors, the Store-Keepers, Yard-Keepers, Dock-Keepers, Watchmen, and all other Of|ficers without Doors, with the Subordi|nation
<PB REF="66" MS="Y">
of all Officers one to another re|&s;pectively, as their Degrees and Offices require, is Admirable. The Watchmen are &s;et duly every Night at &s;tared and certain Places, within the &s;everal Yards, with every one a Bell over his Head, which they Ring, or Toll, every Hour, giving &s;o many Strokes as the Hour reckons, and then one taking it from a|nother through every Part of the Yard, and of all the Yards, makes the Watch|ing Part be performed in a very exact and regular Manner. In the River there is a Guard Boat, which, as the Main-Guard in a Garri&s;on, goes the Grand Rounds at certain Times, to &s;ee that e|very Centinel does his Duty on Board the Ships; the&s;e go by every Ship in the River, and &s;ee that the People on board are at their Po&s;t: If the Ship does not Challenge, that is to &s;ay, if the Man placed to look out does not call, Who comes there? the Guard-Boat boards them immediately, to examin who is deficient in their Duty.</P>
<P>They told us an odd Story of a Guard-Boat, which having not been challenged by the Per&s;on who ought to have been walking on the Foreca&s;tle of the Ship, boarded them on the Bow, and as the Boat's Crew was entering the Ship by the Fore-Chains, they found a Man fal|len over-board, but the Lap of his Coat catching in a Block, was drawn &s;o hard in by the running of the Rope in the Block, that it held the Man fa&s;t, but he was fallen &s;o low, that his Head and Arms hung in the Water, and he was almo&s;t drowned: However, it &s;eems he was not quite Dead; &s;o that catching hold of him, and pulling him out of the Water, they &s;aved his Life: But they added, as the main part of the Story, that the Man could never give any Ac|count of his Di&s;a&s;ter, or how he came to fall over-board&punc; only &s;aid, That it mu&s;t be the Devil that threw him over|board, for nothing el&s;e could do it. How true this Pa&s;&s;age may be, I do not un|dertake to enter upon the Debate of.</P>
<P>The Expedition that has been &s;ome|times u&s;ed here in fitting out Men of War, is very great, and as the Workmen relate it, 'tis indeed incredible; particu|larly, they told us, That the Royal So|vereign, a Fir&s;t Rate of 106 Guns, was riding at her Moorings, entirely unrig|ged, and nothing but her three Ma&s;ts &s;tanding, as is u&s;ual when a Ship is lay'd up and that &s;he was compleatly rigg'd, all her Ma&s;ts up, her Yards put too, her Sails bent, Anchors and Cables on Board, and the Ship failed down to Black Stakes in three Days, Sir Cloude&s;ly Shovell being then her Captain.</P>
<P>I do not vouch the Thing, but when I con&s;ider, fir&s;t, that every thing lay ready in her Store-Hou&s;es, and wanted nothing but to be fetch'd out and car|ry'd on Board, a Thou&s;and or fifteen Hundred Men to be employ'd in it, and more if they were wanted; and every Man knowing his Bu&s;ine&s;s perfectly well, Boats, Carriages, Pullies, Tackles, Cranes, and Hulk all ready, I do not know, but it might be done in one Day, if it was try'd; certain it is, the Dexte|rity of the Engli&s;h Sailors in tho&s;e things, is not to be match'd by the World.</P>
<P>The Building Yards, Docks, Timber Yard, Deal Yard, Ma&s;t Yard, Gun Yard, Rope Walks; and all the o her Yards and Places, &s;et apart for the Works belonging to the Navy, are like a well ordered City; and though you &s;ee the whole Place, as it were, in the utmo&s;t Hurry, yet you &s;ee no Confu&s;ion, every Man knows his own Bu&s;ine&s;s&punc; the ma|&s;ter Builders appoint the Working or Converting, as they call it, of every Piece of Timber, and give to the o$$er Head Workmen, or Foreman, their Moulds for the Squaring and Cutting out of every Piece, and placing it in its proper Birth (&s;o they call it) in the Ship that is in Building, and every Hand is bu&s;y in pur&s;uing tho&s;e Directions, and &s;o in all the other Works.</P>
<P>It is about Sixteen or Eighteen Miles from Roche&s;ter Bridge to Sheerne&s;s $word$ by Water, on the River $span$ this it is about Fourteen Miles $span$ Stakes; the Chanel is &s;o deep $span$ Way, the Banks &s;o &s;oft, and $span$
<PB REF="67">
of the River &s;o &s;hort, that in a Word, 'tis the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t Harbour in the World; and we &s;aw two Ships of Eighty Guns, each riding a float at low Water, within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of Roche&s;ter Bridge. The Ships riding as in a Mill-Pond, or a wet Dock, except that being moor'd at the Chains, they &s;wing up and down with the Tide; but as there is room enough, &s;o they are moor'd in &s;uch manner, that they cannot &s;wing &s;oul of one another; 'tis as &s;afe (I &s;ay) as in a wet Dock, nor did I ever hear of any Accident that befel any of the King's Ships here, I mean by Storms, and 'tis hoped the like may never be known again.</P>
<P>There are two Ca&s;tles on the Shore of this River, the one at Upmo$e, where there is a good Platform of Guns, and which guards two Reaches of the Ri|ver, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to defend all the Ships which ride above, between that $nd the Bridge; al&s;o on the other Shore is Gillingham Ca&s;tle, form'd for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, and well furni&s;h'd with Guns which command the River, be&s;ides which there is a Fort or Platform of Guns at a Place call'd the Swamp, and another at Cockham Wood. But all the&s;e are added, or at lea&s;t Additions made to them, &s;ince the time that the Dutch made that memorable Attempt upon the Royal Navy this Year (viz.) on the 22d of June, in the Year 1667; for at that time all was left unregarded, and, as it were, &s;ecure; there were but four Guns Guns that could be u&s;ed at Upnor, and &s;carce &s;o many at Gillingham, the Car|riages being rotten and broke; and in a Word, every thing concurring to invite the enemy. There were about Twelve Guns at the I&s;le of Shepey, where &s;ince, Sheerne&s;s Fort is built, but the Dutch &s;oon beat them from tho&s;e Guns, and made the Place top hot for them di&s;|mounting al&s;o mo&s;t of the Guns, after which they went boldly up to Black-Stakes with their who&s;e Squadron; and after that Seven of their bigge&s;t Men of War went up as high as Upnor, where they did what Mi&s;chief they could, and went away again, carried off the Royal Charles, a Fir&s;t Rate Ship of 100 Guns, and burning the London, and &s;everal others, be&s;ides the damaging mo&s;t of the Ships which were within their reach; and all things con&s;ider'd, it was a Victory, that they went away without ruining all the re&s;t of the Navy that was in that River.</P>
<P>But as this is a dull Story in it&s;elf, &s;o it is none of my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s, farther than to introduce what follows; namely, That this Alarm gave England &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Con&s;equence of the River Medway, and of the Docks and Yards at Chatham, and of the Danger the Royal Navy lay expo&s;ed to there, that all the&s;e Doors which were open then, are lock'd up and &s;ufficient barr'd &s;ince that time; and 'tis not now in the Power of any Nation under Heaven, no, tho' they &s;hould be Ma&s;ters at Sea, unle&s;s they were Ma&s;ters at Land too at the &s;ame time, to give us &s;uch another Affront; for be&s;ides all the Ca&s;tles, Lines of Guns, and Platforms on each &s;ide the River Medway, as we go up, as above; there is now a Royal Fort built at the Point of the I$$e of Shepey, call'd Sheerne&s;s, which guards that Entrance into the River: This is a regular, and &s;o compleat a Fortification, and has &s;uch a Line of heavy Cannon commanding the Mouth of the River, that no Man of War, or Fleet of Men of War would attempt to pa&s;s by as the Dutch did; or at lea&s;t cou'd not effect it without hazard of being torn to pieces by tho&s;e Bat|teries.</P>
<P>Sheerne&s;s is not only a Fortre&s;s, but a kind of Town with &s;everal Streets in it, and Inhabitants of &s;everal &s;orts&punc; but chiefly &s;uch who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s obliges them to re&s;ide here: The Officers of the Ordnance have here Apartments, and an Office; they being often oblig'd to be here many Days together; e&s;peci|ally in time of War, when the Rendez|vous of the Fleet is at the Nore to &s;ee to the furni&s;hing every Ship with Mili|tary Stores as need requires, and to Cheque, the Officers of the Ships in
<PB REF="68" MS="Y">
their Demands of tho&s;e Stores, and the like.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a Yard for building Ships, with a Dock; the rea&s;on of which, is to repair any Ship &s;peedily that may meet with any Accident, either riding at the Nore, or in any Service at Sea near the River. But then 'tis to be ob&s;erv'd, that tho&s;e are but for Fifth and Sixth Rate Ships, &s;mall Frigats, Yatchts, and &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els; at bigge&s;t, nothing above a Fourth Rate can $ome in here. The Sheerne&s;s Galley, as I am told, was built here, and had her Name on that Occa&s;i|on. This Yard is a late thing al&s;o, and buil$ many Years &s;ince the Fort.</P>
<P>This Fort Commands only the En|trance into the Medway, or that Branch of the Medway, properly, which they call the We&s;t Swale. The Ea&s;t Swale, not Navigable by Ships of Force, goes in by the Town of Queenborough, pa&s;&s;es Ea&s;t, makes the I&s;le of Shepey, parting it on the South &s;ide, and opens to the Sea, near Fover&s;ham, and Swale Cliff, and is therefore of &s;mall Con&s;equence: As for the Expre&s;&s;ion of a certain Author, that Sheerne&s;s divides the Mouth of the Two Rivers, Thames and Medway, 'tis not &s;aid for want of Ignorance, and cannot be true in fact; the Mouth of the Med|way opening into the Thames, and the Mouth of the Thames, not being with|in Twenty Mile of it, (viz.) from the Na&s;e and North Foreland.</P>
<P>At the South-We&s;t Point of the I&s;le of Shepey, where the Ea&s;t-Swale parts from the We&s;t, and pa&s;&s;es on, as above, &s;tands a Town memorable for nothing, but that which is rather a di&s;honour to our Country than otherwi&s;e: Namely, Queenborough; a mi&s;erable dirty, de|cay'd, poor, pitiful, fi&s;hing Town; yet ve&s;ted with Corporation Privileges, has a Mayor, Aldermen, &amp;c. and his Wor|&s;hip the Mayor has his Mace carry'd be|fore him to Church, and attended in as much State and Ceremony as the Mayor of a Town Twenty times as good: I re|member, when I was there, Mr. Mayor was a Butcher, and brought us a Shoulder of Mutton to our Inn him&s;elf in Per&s;on, which we be&s;poke for our Dinner, and afterwards he &s;at down and drank a Bot|tle of Wine with us.</P>
<P>But that which is &s;till wor&s;e and which I meant in what I &s;aid before, is, that this Town &s;ends two Burge&s;&s;es to Parliament, as many as the Burrough of Southwark, or the City of We&s;tmin&s;te$&punc; Tho' it may be pre&s;umed all the Inhabi|tants are not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of E&s;tates an&s;wer|able to the Rent of one good Hou&s;e in either of tho&s;e Places I la&s;t mentioned: The chief Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Town, as I could under&s;tand, con&s;i&s;ts in Ale-Hou&s;es, and Oy&s;ter-Catchers.</P>
<P>Here we took Boat, and went up the Ea&s;t Swale to a Town, which lies as it were hid in the County, and among the Creeks; for 'tis out of the way, and al|mo&s;t out of &s;ight, as well by Water as by Land, I mean Milton; it lyes up &s;o many Creeks and Windings of the Water, that no body $ees it by Water, but they who go on purpo&s;e ou$ of the way to it; and as to the Road&punc; it lyes al&s;o about a Mile on the Left-Hand of the Great Road, as we pa&s;s thro' $span$ no body &s;ees it on that &s;ide neither&punc; unle&s;s they go on purpo&s;e out of the Road to it; and yet it is a large Town, has a con&s;iderable Market, and e&s;pecially for Corn, and Fruit, and Provi&s;ions, which they &s;end to London by Water.</P>
<P>From hence following the Coa&s;t, and the Great Road together, for they are &s;till within view of one another, we come to Fever&s;ham, a large Populous; and as &s;ome &s;ay, a rich Town: Tho' here is no particular remarkable Trade, either for Manufacture or Navigation; the prin|cipal bu&s;ine&s;s we found among them, was Fi&s;hing for Oy&s;ters, which the Dutch fetch hence in &s;uch extraordinary quanti|ties, that when I was there, we found Twelve large Dutch Hoys and Doggers lying there to load Oy&s;ters; and &s;ome|times, as they told us, there are many more: This is greatly to the Advantage of the Place, as it employs abundance of Men and Boats in Drudging for the Oy&s;|ters, which they Catch in great plenty, in the Mouth of the Ea&s;t Swale; which,
<PB REF="69">
as I &s;aid above, enters in this Part of the Country into the Sea, and opens very wide.</P>
<P>It was at the Mouth of this Swale, namely at Shell-Ne&s;s, &s;o call'd from the abundance of Oy&s;ter-Shells always lying there, that the Smack in which the late King James II. was em|bark'd for his E&s;cape into France, ran on &s;hoar and being boarded by the Fi&s;her|men, the King was taken Pri&s;oner; and I mu&s;t mention it to the Reproach of the People of Fever&s;ham, let the Conduct of that Unfortunate Prince be what it will, that the Fi&s;hermen and Rabble can ne|ver be excus'd, who treated the King, even after they were told who he was, with the utmo&s;t indecency, u&s;'d his Maje&s;ty; (for he was then their Sove|reign, even in the acknowledged Sen&s;e of his Enemies) I &s;ay, u&s;ing him with &s;uch Indignity in his Per&s;on, &s;uch In&s;o|$ence in their Behaviour, and giving him &s;uch Opprob$ious and bu&s;ive Language, and &s;earching him in the rude&s;t and mo&s;t indecent manner, and indeed rifling him; that the King him&s;elf &s;aid, he was never more apprehen&s;ive of his Life than at $hat time. He was afterwards carried $y them up to the Town, where he was $ot much better treated for &s;ome time, $ll &s;ome Neighbouring Gentlemen in $e County came in, who under&s;tood $heir Duty better, by whom he was at $a&s;t pre&s;erv'd from farther Violence till $oaches and a Guard came from Lon|$on, by the Prince of Orange's Order, bring him with Safety and Freedom London; where he was at lea&s;t for e pre&s;ent much better received, as in $e Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times is to be &s;een. While I was near this Town &s;ome ars ago, a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing Accident ppen'd, namely, the $lowing up of a wder Mill, which &s;tood upon the Ri|r, clo&s;e to the Town; the Bla&s;t was t only frightful, but it &s;hatter'd the $ole Town, broke the Windows, $ down Chimneys, and Gable-ends $ a few; al&s;o &s;everal People were $word$ at the Powder-Hou&s;e it&s;elf, tho' not $word$ as I remember, in the Town: But what was mo&s;t remarkable in it all, was, that the Elde&s;t Son of the Ma&s;ter of the Powder-Mill, a Youth of about Fif een Years of Age, who was not in the Mill, or near it, when it blew up; but in a Boat upon the River, row$$$ cro&s;s for his Diver&s;ion, was kill'd by a Piece of the building of the Mill, which blew up into the Air by the Force of the Pow|der, and fell down upon him in the Boat: I know nothing el&s;e this Town is remarkable for, except the mo&s;t notorious Smuggling Trade, carried on partly by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Dutch, in their Oy&s;ter-Boats, and partly by other Arts, in which they &s;ay, the People herea|bouts are ar$i$'d to &s;uch a Proficiency, that they are grown mon&s;trous Rich by that wicked Trade; nay, even the Owl|ing Trade (&s;o they call the Clande&s;tine Exporting of Wool) has &s;eem'd to be tran&s;po&s;ed from Rum$ey Mar&s;h to this Coa&s;t, and a great deal of it has been carried on between the Mouth of the Ea&s;t Swale and the North Foreland.</P>
<P>As to the landing Goods here from Holland and France, &s;uch as Wine and Brandy from the latter, and Pepper, Tea, Coffee, Callicoes, Tobacco, and &s;uch Goods, (the Duties of which being very high in England, had fir&s;t been drawn back by Debentures) that black Trade has not only been carried on here, as I was informed, but on both &s;ides the Re|ver, on the E&s;&s;ex as well as the Ke$$i&s;h Shores, of which I &s;hall &s;peak again in its place.</P>
<P>From this Ea&s;t-Swale, and particu|larly from the&s;e la&s;t Three Towns, Queenborough, Mil on, and Fever&s;ham, the Fi&s;h-Market at Billing&s;gate is &s;up|ply'd with &s;everal &s;orts of Fi&s;h; but par|ticularly with the be&s;t and large&s;t Oy&s;|ters, &s;uch as they call Stewing Oy&s;ters; which are generally call'd Melton Oy&s;ters; &s;ome of which are exceeding large, as al&s;o with a very great quantity of others of a le&s;&s;er &s;ize, as they are from the E&s;&s;ex Side, with a &s;maller and greener &s;ort, call'd Wallfleet; &s;o that the whole City of London is chiefly &s;upplied with Oy&s;|ters from this Part of the Thames.</P>

From hence al&s;o are &s;ent by Water to London very great quantities of Fruit; that is to &s;ay Apples, and Cherries; which are produc'd in this County, more than in any County in England, e&s;pecially Cherries; and this leads me to cro&s;s the Hills from Milton to Maid&s;tone, a Town on the River Medway, about Ten Miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>This is a con&s;iderable Town, very po|pulons, and the Inhabitants generally wealthy; 'tis the County Town, and the River Medway is Navigable to it by large Hoys, of 50 to 60 Tuns Burthern, the Tide flowing quite up to the Town; round this Town are the large&s;t Cherry Orchards, and the mo&s;t of them that are in any Part of England; and the Gro&s;s of the quantity of Cherries, and the be&s;t of them which &s;upply the whole City of London come f om hence, and are therefore call'd Kenti&s;h Cherries.</P>
<P>Here likewi&s;e, and in the Country adjacent, are great quantities of Hops planted, and this is call'd the Mother of Hop Grounds in England; being the fir&s;t Place in England, where Hops were planted in any quantity, and long before any were planted at Canterbury, tho' that be now &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Chief Place in England, as &s;hall be ob&s;erv'd in its Place: The&s;e were the Hops, I &s;uppo&s;e, which were planted at the be|ginning of the Reformation, and which gave occa&s;ion to that Old Di&s;tich&punc;</P>
<Q><L>Hops, Reformation, Bays, and Beer,</L>
<L>Came into England all in a Year.</L></Q>
<P>Maid&s;tone is eminent for the Plenty of Provi&s;ions, and richne&s;s of Lands in the Country all around it, and for the be&s;t Market in the County, not Roche&s;ter, no not Canterbury excepted.</P>
<P>From this Town, and the Neighbour|ing Parts, London is &s;upplied with more Particulars than from any &s;ingle Market Town in England; which I mention in pur&s;uance of my fir&s;t Re&s;olution of ob|&s;erving, how every Part of England fur|ni&s;hes &s;omething to the City of Lon|don.</P>

<P N="2">2. From the &s;ame Country are brought great quantites of the large&s;t Timber for &s;upply of the King's Yards at Cha$ham and often to London; mo&s;t of which comes by Land Carriage to Maid&s;tone.</P>
<P N="3">3. From the Country adjoining to Maid|&s;tone, al&s;o is a very great quantity of Corn brought up to London, be&s;ides Hops and Cherries, as above.</P>
<P N="4">4. Al&s;o a kind of Paving Stone, about Eight to Ten Inches quare, &s;o durable that it &s;carce ever wears out, 'tis u&s;ed to pave Court-yards, and Pa&s;&s;ages to Gentlemens Hou&s;es, being the &s;ame $word$ Royal Exchange at London is $span$ which has never yet wanted the $word$ Repair.</P>
<P N="5">5. Al$o fine white Sand for the Gla&s;s|hou&s;es, e&s;teem'd the be&s;t in England for melting into Flint-Gla&s;s, and Looking Gla&s;s-Plates; and for the Stationer's u&s;e al&s;o, vulgarly call'd Writing Sand.</P>
<P N="6">6. Al&s;o very great quantities of Fruit, &s;uch as Kenti&s;h Pipi$s, Runetts, &amp;c. which come up as the Cherries do, whole Hoy-Loads at a time to the Wharf, call'd the Three Cranes, in London; which is the greate&s;t Pipin Market per|haps in the World.</P>
<P>At Maid&s;tone you begin to Conver&s;e with Gentlemen, and Per&s;ons of Rank of both Sexes, and &s;ome of Quality: All that &s;ide of the County which I have mentioned already, as it is Mar&s;hy, and unhealthy, by its Situation among the Waters; &s;o is it embara&s;s'd with Bu&s;ine&s;s and inhabited chiefly by Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uch as Ship Builders; Fi&s;hermen, Sea|faring-Men, Husbend-Men, or &s;uch as

depend upon them, and very few Fami|ies of Note are found among them. But os &s;oon as we come down Boxley-Hill from Roche&s;ter, or Hollingbourn-Hill, from Milton, and de&s;cend from the poor chalky Downs, and deep foggy Mar&s;hes, to the whole&s;ome rich Soil, the well-wooded, and well watered Plain on the Banks of the Medway, we find the Country every where &s;pangled with populous Villages, and delicious Se ts of the Nobility and Gentry; and e&s;pecially in the North-&s;ide of the River, begin|ning at Aylesford, on the Medway, and lo king Ea&s;t towards th Sea: I his Ayles|ford was form rly the Seat of Sir John B$nk$, and &s;ince de&s;cended, by his Daugh|ter, to Heneage Lord Fench, Brother to the Earl of Not$ingham, and created Earl of Aylesford, which E&s;tate he came to in Right of his &s;aid Lady: The Gen|try this way, I $ &s;ay, is $ull of Gentle|&s;mens Hou&s;es, reckoning from this Ayles|ford, below Maid&s;tone, o$ the Medway to Ea&s;twell, near A&s;hf rd, the Seat of $he Earl of Winchel&s;ea, another Noble Family of the Name of Finch al&s;o; tho' not nearly allied to the Not ingham Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e are the ancient Families of Fane, Colepeper, Deerham, Hony|wood, Watt$n, Roberts, Hales, and others, with &s;ome good Families exti$ct and gone, who&s;e Names however remain in Memo y.</P>
<P>This Neighbourhood of Per&s;ons of Figure and Quality, makes Maid&s;tone a very agreeable Place to live in, and where a Man of Letters, and Manners, will always find &s;uitable Society, both to divert and imp$ove him&s;elf; &s;o that here is, what is not often found, namely, a town of very great Bu&s;ine&s;s and Trade, and yet full of Gentry, of Mirth, and of good Company.</P>
<P>It is to be recorded h$re for the Ho|nour of the Gentry in this Part of Eng|land; that tho' they are as &s;ociable and entertaining as any People are, or can be de&s;ired to be, and as much famed for good Manners, and good Humour; yet the new Mode of forming A&s;&s;emblies &s;o much, and &s;o fatally now in Vogue, in other Parts of England, could never pre|vail here; and that tho' there was an Attempt made by &s;ome l$o&s;e Per&s;ons, and the Gentlemen, and Ladies, did for a little while appear there; yet they ge|nerally di&s;lik'd the practice, &s;oon de|clin'd to give their Company, as to a Thing &s;candalous, and &s;o it drop'd of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>There is not much Manufacturing in this County; what is left, is chiefly at Canterbury, and in this Town of Maid&s;tone, and the Neighbourhood; the M$nu$act re of this Town is principally in Thread, $hat is $o &s;ay, Linnen Thread, which they make to pr$t$y good per ec|tion, tho` not extraordinary fine. At C$o rock, Teuterden, Goudhur&s;t, and other Villages thereabout, which are al&s;o on in the Neighbourhood of this Par$, on the oth r fi$e the Medway, there was once a very con&s;iderable Cloath|ing Trade carry'd on, and the Yeomen of Kent, of which &s;o much has been famed, were generally the inhabitants &s;ide, and who were much enrich'd by that Cloathing Tr de; but th$t Trade is now quite decay'd, and &s;carce Ten Clothiers left in all the County.</P>
<P>The Clothiers and Farmers, and the re|mains of them, upon the General Elect$ons of M$mbers of Parli ment for the Coun|ty, &s;hows them&s;elves &s;till there, being ordin rily 4 or 1500 Freeholders brought from this &s;ide of the County; and who for the plainne&s;s of their appearance, are cal'd the Grey Coats of Cent; but ore &s;o con&s;id$rable, that who ever they Vote for is always &s;ure to carry it, and there|fore the Gentlemen are very carefull to prefere their Intere&s;t among them.</P>
<P>$ This Town of Maid&s;tone is a pecu+$ar of the Archbi&s;hoprick of Ca$terbury&punc; and the Archbi&s;hop for the time being, is the proper Incumbent, or Per&s;on of the Pa|ri&s;h, and puts in a Curate to off$cia e for him. Here is the C$unty Goal al&s;o

and generally the A&s;&s;izes, and always the Elections are held here: Here was a hot Action in the Time of the Civil Wars, between a Party of Gentlemen who took Arms for the King, and who being defeated here, march'd boldly to|wards London, as if they had intended to go directly thither, but turn'd &s;hort, and to their Enemies &s;urpri&s;e, unexpect|edly cro&s;s'd the Thames, and joining &s;ome E&s;&s;ex Gentlemen of the &s;ame Party, went to Colche&s;ter, where they &s;uffered a fu|rious Siege and Blockade; and defended the Town to the la&s;t Extremity, as you have &s;een in my Account of that Place,</P>
<P>In Pro&s;ecution of my Journey Ea&s;t&punc; I went from hence to Canterbury; of which Town and its Antiquities &s;o much has been &s;aid, and &s;o accurately, that I need do no more then mention it by Recapitu|lation; for, as I have &s;aid, the Antiqui|ties, and Hi&s;tories of particular Places is not my bu&s;ine&s;s here, &s;o much as the p e&s;ent State of them, However I ob|&s;erve here,</P>
<P N="1">1.

This Gregory it &s;eems was a true Pri|mitive Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop of Rome; not &s;uch as &s;ince are called &s;o, long before they a&s;&s;um'd the Title of Popes, or that u&s;urp'd Honour of Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P N="2">2. That, &s;even Bi&s;hops of Canterbury, from St. Augu&s;tine, inclu&s;ive of him&s;elf, lie bury'd here in one Vault.</P>
<P N="3">3. That Thomas Becket, or Thomas a Becket, as &s;ome call him Archbi&s;hop of this See, and &s;everal Archbi&s;hops be|fore him, Plagued, In&s;ulted, and Tyran|niz'd over the King's of England, their Soveraigns, in an un&s;ufferable manner.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the fir&s;t of the&s;e, having made him&s;elf intolerable to King Henry II. by his Ob&s;tinacy, Pride and Rebellion was here murder'd by the Connivance, and as &s;ome &s;ay, by the Expre&s;s Order of the King, and that they &s;hew his Blood upon the Pavement to this day.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P N="6">6. That the bodies of King Henry IV and of Edward the black Prince a $word$ here, and the magnificent Effigie&punc; of the latter very curiou&s;ly Carv'd $word$ Engrav'd, lies on his Tomb, o$ M$nu|ment; al&s;o that King Stephen &s;hould have lain here, but on &s;ome &s;cruple of the Monks, the Corp&s;e was &s;top$ $span$ the Road, and was afterwards $word$ at Fever&s;ham, about &s;even Mile&punc; off. What the Monks objected or whether they had no Money offered them, is not Re|corded with the re&s;t of the S$o$y.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the Immen&s;e Wealth offer'd by Votaries, and Pilgrims, for &s;everal Ages to the Altar, or Shrine of this Mock Saint, Thomas Becker, was &s;uch, that Era&s;mus Roterdamus, who was in the Repo&s;itory and &s;aw it, relates of it, That the whole Place glitter'd and &s;hone with Gold and Diamonds.</P>
<P N="8">8.

<P>The Church is a Noble Pile of build|ing indeed, and looks Venerable and Maje&s;tick at a di&s;tance, as well as when we come nearer to it. The old Mona&s;tery of all&punc; with the Church there, dedicated to St. Augu&s;tine, and in the Porch of
<PB REF="73" MS="Y">
which St. Augu&s;tine him&s;elf, with the $ix Bi&s;hops above mention'd lye buried, $ands at, or rather &s;tood at a di&s;tance, $nd the Ruins of it &s;hew the place &s;uffi|$iently; what remains of the Old Build|$ngs about Chri&s;t-Church, or the Cathe|$ral, are principally the Cloy&s;ter, and $he Bi&s;hop's Palace, which however is $ather to be call'd a Building rai&s;ed from $he Old Hou&s;e, than a Part of it.</P>
<P>Under the Church is a large Prote&s;tant $rench Church, given fir&s;t by Queen Eli|$abeth to the Walloons, who fled hither $rom the Per&s;ecution of the Duke D' Al|$a, and the King of France; and who&s;e Number has been &s;ince very much en|$rea&s;ed by the particular Cruelty of Lewis XIV.</P>
<P>The Clo&s;s or Circumvallation, where $he Hou&s;es of the Prebendaries, and other Per&s;ons belonging to this Cathedral &s;tand, $s ve y &s;pacious and fair, and a great ma|$y very good Hou&s;es are Built in it, and $ome with good Gardens; where tho&s;e Gentlemen live at large, and among whom a very good Neighbour-hood is kept up; as for the Town, its Antiquity &s;eems to be its greate&s;t Beauty: The Hou&s;es are truly Antient, and the many Ruins of Churches, Chapels, Oratories, and &s;maller Cells of Religious People, makes the Place look like a general Ruin a little recover'd.</P>
<P>The City, will &s;carce bear being call'd Populous, were it not for Two or Three Thou&s;and French Prote&s;tants, which, in|cluding Men, Women and Children, they &s;ay there are in it, and yet the$ tell me the Number of the&s;e decrea&s;es Daily.</P>
<P>The Employment of tho&s;e Refugees was chiefly Broad Silk Weaving; but that Trade was &s;o decay'd before the fir&s;t Act for Prohibiting the Wearing of Ea&s;t $ndia Silks pa&s;s'd, that there were not Twenty Broad Looms left in the City, of near Three Hundred that had the Ci|ty, of near Three Hundred that had formerly been there; upon the Pa&s;&s;ing that Act, the Trade reviv'd again, and the Number of Ma&s;ter Work Men en|crea&s;$$ and the Ma&s;ters en$r$a&s;ed; and the $span$ which were there before, encrea&s;ing their Works al&s;o, the Town fill'd again, and a great many Looms were employ'd; but after this by the encroaching of the Printed Callicoes, Chints, &amp;c. and the prevailing of the Smuggling Trade as above, the Silk T$ade decay'd a Second time. But now the U&s;e and Wear of printed Callicoes and Chints, being by Act of Parliament &s;everely prohibited, 'tis expected the Silk Trade at Canterbury will revive a Third time, and the Inhabitants promi&s;e them&s;elves much from it.</P>
<P>But the great Wealth and Encrea&s;e of the City of Canterbury, is from the &s;$r|prizing Encrea&s;e of the Hop Grounds all round the Place; it is within the Me|mory of many of the Inhabitants now living, and that none of the olde&s;t nei|ther, that there was not an Acre of Ground planted with Hops in the whole Neighbourhood, or &s;o few as not to be wor$h naming; whereas I was a&s;&s;ured that there are at this time near Six Thou|&s;and Acres of Ground &s;o planted, within a very few Miles of the City; I do not vouch the Number, and I confe&s;s it &s;eems incredible, but I deliver it as I receiv'd it.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erv'd that the Ground round this City proves mo$e particularly fruitful for the growth of Hops than of any other production, which was not at fir&s;t known, but which, upon its being di&s;cover'd, &s;et all the World, &s;peaking in the Language of a Neighbourhood, a digging up their Grounds and Planting; &s;o that now they may &s;ay without boa&s;ting, there is at Canterbury the greate&s;t Plantation of Hops in the whole I&s;land.</P>
<P>The River Stour was made Navigable to this City, by virtue of an Act of Par|liament in the Reign of King Henry VIII. but the Per&s;on who undertook i$, not meeting with Encouragement, and fail|ing in the carrying it on, the Locks and Sluices are all run to decay, and the Citi|zens are oblig'd to fetch all their heavy Goods, either from Fordwich. Three Miles off, or from Whit&s;table Seven Miles off; the latter they chu&s;e for &s;uch heavy Goods as come from London; as
<PB REF="74" MS="Y">
Oyl, Wine, Grocery, &amp;c. becau&s;e 'tis the le&s;s hazard by Sea; but as for Coals, Deals, &amp;c. they come by way of Sand|wich, and are brought up the River to Fordwich, as a$ove.</P>
<P>In $word$ Neighbourhood of this City are &s;ome Antient Families as Sir Tho Hale$, the Lord Strangford, Sir Henry Oxen|den, and &s;evera$ others, the two former Roman; al&s;o Sir George Rook, famous for his Services at Sea again$$ the French; the la&s;t of which was in the S$reights, where the French Fleet was Command|ed by the Count de Tou$ville, Admiral of France; where both &s;ides Fought with &s;uch equal Gallantry, and Re&s;olu|tion, and the Strength of the F$eets were &s;o equal, tho' the French the mo&s;t in Number of the two, tha$ neither &s;eem'd to &s;eek a &s;econd Engagement; and of which the following Lines were made by &s;ome of the Merry Wits of that Time.</P>
<LG>
<L>The Great Tourville Sir George did Beat,</L>
<L>The Great Sir George Beat him;</L>
<L>But if they chance again to meet,</L>
<L>George will his Jacket trim:</L>
<L>They both did Fight, they both did Beat,</L>
<L>They both did run away;</L>
<L>They both did &s;trive again to meet,</L>
<L>The clean contrary way.</L>
</LG>
<P>The Shore from Whit&s;table, and the Ea&s;t-Swale, affords nothing remarkable but Sea-Marks and &s;mall Towns on the Coa&s;t, 'till we come to Margate and the North Foreland; the Town of Margate is Eminent for nothing that I know of, but for King William's frequently Land|ing here in his returns from Holland, and for Shipping a va&s;t quantity of Corn for London Market, mo&s;t, if not all of it, the Product of the I&s;le of Thanes, in which it &s;tands.</P>
<P>On the North-Ea&s;t Point of this Land, is the Promontory, or Head-land which I have often mentioned, call'd the North Foreland; which, by a Line drawn due North to the Na&s;e in E&s;&s;ex, about Six Miles &s;hort of Harwich, makes the Mouth of the River Thames, and the Port of London: As &s;oon as any Ve&s;&s;els pa&s;s this Foreland from London, they are properly &s;aid to be in the open Sea; if to the North they enter the German Ocean, if to the South, the Chanel, as it is called, that is, the Narrow Seas between D$gland and France; and all the Towns or Harbours before we c$me this Length, whether on the Ken$i&s;h or E&s;&s;ex Shoar, are called Members of the Port of London.</P>
<P>From this Point We&s;tward, the fir&s;t Town of Note is Ram&s;gate, a &s;mall Port, the Inhabitants are mighty fond of having us call it Roman's-Gate, pretend|ing that the Romans, under Julius Cae|&s;ar, made teeir fir&s;t Attempt to l$nd here, when he was driven back by a Storm; but &s;oon returned, and coming on Shore with a good Body of Troops beat back the Britains, and fortify d his Camp ju&s;t at the Entrance of the Creek, where the Town now &s;tands; all which may be true, for ought any one knows, $ut is not to be proved, either by the$ or any one el&s;e; and is of &s;o $$$le Concern to us, that it matters nothing whether here or at Deal, where others pretend it was.</P>
<P>It was from this Town of Ram&s;gate, that a Fellow of Gagantick Strength, though not of extraordinary Stature, came abroad in the World, and was called the Engli&s;h Samp&s;on, and who &s;uffered Men to fa&s;ten the &s;tronge&s;t Hor&s;e they could find, to a Rope, and the Rope round his Loins, &s;itting on the Ground, with his Feet &s;trait out again&s;t a Po&s;t, and no Hor&s;e could &s;tir him; &s;everal other Proofs of an incredible Strength, he gave before the King, and abundance of the Nobility, at Ken&s;ington, which no other Man could equal; but his Hi&s;tory was very &s;hort, for in about a Year he di&s;appeared, and we heard no more of him &s;ince</P>
<P>Sandwich is the next Town, lying in the bottom of a Bay, at the Mouth of the River Stour, an old, decay'd, poor, mi&s;erable Town, of which when I have
<PB REF="75" MS="Y">
&s;aid that it is an Antient Town, one of the Cinque Ports, and &s;ends two Mem|bers to Parliament: I have &s;aid all that I think can be worth any bodies reading of the Town of Sandwich.</P>
<P>From hence to Deal is about&mdash;Miles. This Place is famous for the Road for Shipping, &s;o well known all over the Trading World, by the Name of the Downs, and where almo&s;t all Ships which arrive from Foreign Parts for London, or go from London to Foreign Parts, and who pa&s;s the Cannel&punc; gene$|ally &s;top; the Homewa d bound to di&s;|patch Letters&punc; &s;e d their Merchants and Owners the good News of their arrival, and $et their Pa&s;&s;engers on Shoar, and the like; and the Out-ward-bound to re|ceive their la&s;t Orders, Letters, and fare|wells from Owners, and Friends, take in re&s;h Provi&s;ions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sometimes, and when the Wind pre|&s;ents fair, Ships do come in here, and pa&s;s thro' at once, without coming $o an Anc$or; for they are not oblig'd to &s;top, but for their own Convenience: This Place would be a very Wild and Den|gerous Road for Ships, were it not for the South Foreland, a Head of Land forming the Ea&s;t Point of the Kenti&s;h Shoar; and is called, the South, as its Situation re&s;pects the North Foreland; and which breaks the Sea off, whi$h would otherwi&s;e come rowling up from the We&s;t, this and a Flat, or the Bank of Sands, which for Three Leagues toge|ther, and at about a League, or League and half di&s;tance run parallel with the Shore, and are dry at low Water, the&s;e two, I &s;ay, break all the Force of the Sea, on the Ea&s;t and South, and South-We&s;t; &s;o that the Downs is counted a very good Road.</P>
<P>And yet on &s;ome particular Winds, and e&s;pecially, if they over-blow, the Downs proves a very wild Ro$d, Ships are driven f om their An ho$s, and often run o$ Shoar or are forced on the &s;aid Sands, or into S$$dwich-Bay or Ram$|gate-Peer, as above, in grea$ di&s;tre&s;s; this is particula$ly when the Wind blows hard at S. E or at E. by N. or E. N. E and &s;ome other $oints; and terrible ha|vock has been made in the Downs at &s;uch times.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t unhappy Account that can be given of any Di&s;a&s;ter in the Downs, is in the time of that terrible Tempe&s;t, which we call by way of di&s;|tinction, The great Storm, being on 27th of November 1703, unhappy in particular; for that there chanced ju&s;t at that time to be a great part of the Royal Navy under Sir Cloude&s;ly Shovel, ju&s;t come into the Downs, in their way to Chatham, to be l$id up</P>
<P>Five of the bigge&s;t Ships had the good hap o pu&s;h th$o the Downs the Day before, finding the Wind then blow $ery hard, and were come to an Anchor at the Gun&s;heet; and had they had but one fair Day more, they had been all &s;afe at at the Nore, or in the River Medway at Black&s;takes.</P>
<P>There remain'd in the Downs about Twelve Sail when this terrible bla&s;t be|gan, at which time England may be &s;aid to have received the greate&s;t Lo&s;s that ever happen'd to the Royal Navy at onetime; either by Weather, by Ene|mies, or by any Accident what&s;oever; the &s;hort account of it, as they &s;hewed it me in the Town, I mean of what hap|pened in the Downs, is as follows</P>
<P>The Northumberland, a Third Rate, carrying 70 Guns, and 353 Men; the Re&s;toration a Second Rate, carrying 76 Guns, and 386 Men; the Sterling-Ca&s;|tle, a Second Rate, carrying 80 Guns, and $00 Men, but had but 349 Men on board; and the Mary, a Third Rate, of 64 Guns, having 273 Men on board; the&s;e were all Lo&s;t, with all their M$n, high and low; except only one Man, out of the Mary, and 70 Men out of the Sterling-Ca&s;tle, who were taken up by Boats from Deal.</P>
<P>All this was be&s;ides the Lo&s;s of Mer|chants Ships, which was exceeding great, not here only, but in almo&s;t all the Por$$ in the South, and We&s;t of England; and
<PB REF="76" MS="Y">
al&s;o in Ireland, which I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to mention again in another Place.</P>
<P>From hence we pa&s;s over a plea&s;ant Champian Country, with the Sea, and the Coa&s;t of France, clear in your view, and by the very Gates of the ancient Ca&s;tle (to the Town) of Dover: As we go we pa&s;s by Deal Ca&s;tle, and Sandown Ca&s;tle, two &s;mall Works, of no Strength by Land, and not of &s;o much u&s;e by Sea; but however maintain'd by the Government for the Ordinary Servi|ces of Salutes, and protecting &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, which can lie &s;afe under their Cannon from Picaroons, Privateers, &amp;c. in time of War.</P>
<P>Neither Dover nor its Ca&s;tle has any Thing of Note to be &s;aid of them, but what is in common with their Neigh|bours: the Ca&s;tle is old, u&s;ele&s;s decay'd, and &s;erves for little; but to give the Ti|tle and Honour of Government to Men of Quality, with a Salary, and &s;ometimes to tho&s;e that want one.</P>
<P>The Town, is one of the Cinque Ports, &s;ends Members to Parliament, who are call'd Barons, and has it&s;elf an ill repair'd, dangerous, and good for little Harbour and Peir, very chargeable and little worth. The Packets for France go off here as al&s;o tho&s;e for Nieuport, with the Mails for Flanders, and all tho&s;e Ships which carry Freights from New York to Holland, and from Virginia to Holland, come ge|nerally hither, and unlade their Goods, Enter them with, and &s;how them to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers, pay the Duties, and then Enter them again by Certifi|cate, Reload them, and draw back the Duty by Debenture, and &s;o they go away for Holland.</P>
<P>In the time of the late War with France, here was a large Victualling. Office keps for the Navy, and a Com|mi&s;&s;ioner appointed to manage it, as there was al&s;o at Chatham, Port&s;mouth, other Places; but this is now unem|ploy'd: The Duke of Queensberry in Scotland, who was Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner to the Parliament there, at the time of making the Union, was after the &s;aid Union created Duke of Dover, which Title is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd now by his So$.</P>
<P>From this Place the Coa&s;t affords no|thing of Note; but &s;ome other &s;mall Cinque Ports, &s;uch as Hi$h and R$m|ney, and Rye, and as we pa&s;s to them Folk&s;tone, eminent chiefly for a multi|tude of Fi&s;hing Boats belonging to it, which are one part of the Year em|ploy'd in catching Mackarel for $he City of London: The Folk$to$e Men catch them, and the London and B$$|ing Mackarel Smacks, of which $span$ &s;poken at large in E&s;&s;ex&punc; come $span$ buy them&punc; and fly up $o $span$ them, with &s;uch a $span$ &s;o high that one wou$d $span$ &s;mall Boats cou'd bear it $span$ not over&s;et: About $span$ Folk&s;tone Barks, among others $word$ Sho$eham, Brigh$helm&s;ton and $span$ away to Yarmouth, and L$o&s;tof$, $word$ the Coa&s;t of Suffolk and No$folk, to the Fi&s;hing Fair, and catch Herrings for the Merchants the$e, of which I have &s;po|ken at large in my Di&s;cour&s;e on th$t Subject.</P>
<P>As I rode along this Coa&s;t I per|ceiv'd &s;everal Dragoons, riding Offi ers, and others arm'd and on Hor&s;$ba k, riding always about as if they were Hu$$$|men beating up their Game; upo$ in|quiry I found their diligence w$s em|ploy'd in que&s;t of the Owlers, as $word$ call them, and &s;ometimes they catch &s;ome of them; but when I c$me to enquire farther, I found too, $span$ times the&s;e are attack'd in the Night, with &s;uch Numbers, that they da$e not re&s;i&s;t, or if they do, they are wound$d and beaten, and &s;ometimes kill'd; and and at other times are oblig'd as it were, to &s;tand &s;till, and &s;ee the W$$ll carry'd off before their Faces, n$t dar|ing to meddle; and the Boats taking it in from the very Hor&s;es backs, go im|mediately off, and are on the Coa&s;t of France, before any Notice can be give$ of them, while the other are as $imble to return with their Hor&s;es to their Haunts and Retreats, where they are not ea&s;ily found out.</P>
<P><PB REF="77" MS="Y">
But I find &s;o many of the&s;e de&s;perate Follows are of late taken up, by the Courage and Vigilance of the Soldiers, that the Knots are very much broken, and the Owling-Trade much abated, at lea&s;t on that &s;ide; the French al&s;o find|ing means to be &s;upply'd from Ireland with much le&s;s Hazard, and at very lit|tle more Expence.</P>
<P>From Rumney-Mar&s;h the Shoar $word$ it &s;elf a great way into the Sea, and $word$ that Point of Land, call'd Dengey-N$$; between this Point of Land and Beachy, it was that the French in the height of their Naval glory took the Engli&s;h and Dutch Fleets at &s;ome di&s;advantage, offering them Battle, when the French were &s;o &s;uperior in Number, that it was not con&s;i&s;tent with Humane Prudence to venture an Engagement, the French being Ninety to Ships of the Line of Battle, and the Engli&s;h and Dutch, put together, not Sixty Sail; the French Ships al&s;o generally bigger: yet &s;uch was the eagerne&s;s of both the Engl&s;h and Dutch Seamen, and Commanders, that it was not withont Murmurings, that Admiral Herbert &s;tood $way, and call'd off the Dutch, who had the Van, from Engaging; the Engli&s;h it &s;eems be|liev'd them&s;elves &s;o &s;uperiour to the French when they came to lye Broad-&s;ide and Broad-&s;ide, Yard-arm and Yard-arm, as the Seamen call it in an En|gagement, that they would admit of no Excu&s;e for not Fighting; tho' according to all the Rules of War, no Admiral could ju&s;tify hazarding the Royal Navy on &s;uch Terms; and e&s;pecialy the Cir|cum&s;tances of the Time then con&s;idered, for the King was in Ireland, and King James ready in France, if the Engli&s;h and Dutch Fleets had received a blow, to have Embark'd with an Army for England, which perhaps would have hazarded the whole Revolution; &s;o that Wi&s;e Men afterwards, and as I have been told, the King him&s;elf upon a full hear|ing ju&s;tify'd the Conduct of Admiral Herbert, and afterwards Created him Earl of Torrington.</P>
<P>Here, or rather a little farther, we &s;ay the Bones of one of the Dutch Men of War, which was Burnt and Strand|ed by the French in that Action; the Towns of Rye, Winc$e$&s;ea, and Ha&s;t|ings, have little in them to de&s;erve more than a bare mention; Rye would flouri&s;h again, if her Harbour, which was once able to receive the Royal Navy, cou'd be re&s;tor'd; but as it is, the Bar is &s;o loaded with Sand ca&s;t up by the Sea, that Ships nf 200 Tun chu&s;e to ride it out under De$gey or Beachy&punc; tho' with the greate&s;t danger, rather than to run the hazard of going into Rye for &s;hel|ter: It is true, ther is now an Act of Parliament pa&s;s'd for the re&s;toring this Port to its former State, when a Man of War of 70 Guns might have &s;afely gone in; but 'tis very doubtful, whether it will be effectual to the main End or no, after &s;o long a time.</P>
<P>Indeed our Merchant Ships are often put to great Extremity hereabout, for there is not one &s;afe Place for them to run into, between Port&s;mouth and the Downs; whereas in former Days, Rye-Bay was an A&s;ylum, a &s;afe Harbour, where they could go boldly in, and ri$e &s;afe all Weathers, and then go to Sea a|gain at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I rom a little beyond Ha&s;tings to Bourn, we ride upon the Sands in a &s;trait Line for eighteen Miles, all upon the Coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex, pa&s;&s;ing by Pem&s;ey, or Peven&s;ey Haven, and the Mouth of the River, which cometh from Battle, without &s;o much as knowing that there was a River, the Tide being out, and all the Water of the ordinary Chanel of the River &s;inking away in the Sand: This is that famou$ Strand, where William the Norman lan|ded with his whole Army; and near to which, namely, at the Town of Battle above-named, which is about nine Miles off, he fought that memorable Fight with Harold then King of England; in which the Fate of this Nation was determined, and where Victory gave the Crown to the Conqueror and his Race; of the Par|ticulars of all which, our Hi&s;torians are full.</P>
<P><PB REF="78" MS="Y">
This Town of Battle is remarkable for little now, but for making the fine&s;t Gun-Powder, and the be&s;t perhaps in Europe. Near this Town of Battle, they &s;how us a Hill with a Beacon upon it, which &s;ince the Beacon was &s;et up in|deed has been call'd Beacon Hill, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es; but was before that call'd Standard&punc;Hi$l, being the place where William the Conqueror &s;et up his Great Standard of Defiance, the Day before the great Battle with Harold and the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>From the beginning of Rumney Mar&s;h, that is to &s;ay, at Sandgate, or Sand$oot Ca&s;tle near Hith, to this Place, the Coun|try is a rich Fertile Soil, full of feeding Grounds, and where an infinite number of large Sheep are fed every Year, and &s;ent up to London Market; the&s;e Rum|ney Mar&s;h Sheep, are counted rather lar|ger than the Leice&s;ter-&s;hire and Lincoln|&s;hire Sheep, of which &s;o much is &s;aid el&s;e-where.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the va&s;t quantity of Sheep as above, abundance of large Bullocks are fed in this part of the Country; and e&s;|pecially tho&s;e they call Stall'd Oxen, that is, Hou&s;e fed, and kept within the Far|mers Sheds or Yards, all the latter Sea|&s;on, where they are fed for the Winter Market. This I noted, becau&s;e the&s;e Oxen are generally the large&s;t Beef in England.</P>
<P>From hence it was that, turning North, and traver&s;ing the deep, dirty, but rich Part of the&s;e two Counties, I had the curio&s;ity to &s;ee the great Foun|daries, or Iron-Works, which are in this County, and where they are carrv'd on at &s;uch a prodigious Expence of Wood, that even in a Country almo&s;t all over|run with Timber, they began to com|plain of the con&s;uming it fot tho&s;e Fur|naces, and leaving the next Age to want Timber for building their Navies; I mu&s;t own however, that I found that Com|plaint perfectly groundle&s;s, the Three Countries of Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, and Hamp|&s;hire, (all which lye contiguous to one another) being one in-exhau&s;tible Store-Hou&s;e of Timber never to be de&s;troy'd, but by a general Conflagration, and able at this time to &s;upply Timber to rebuild all the Royal Navies in Europe, if hey were all to be de&s;troy'd, and &s;et about the building them together.</P>
<P>After I had fatigued my &s;elf i$ p$&s;&s;$ng this deep and heavy part of the Country, I thought it would not be Foreign to my de&s;ign, if I refre&s;$'d my &s;elf with a view of Tunbridge Wells, which were $word$ then above Twelve Miles out of $y way.</P>
<P>When I came to the wells, which $span$ Five Miles nearer to me than $span$ &s;uppo&s;ing me then at Ba$tle to $span$ ward of them; I found a $span$ good Company the$e, an$ $span$ was more particular, was $span$ to be at the ti$e $span$ Highne&s;s the Prince of W$les was $span$ with abundance of the Nobility, $word$ Gentry of the Country, who to Honour the Prince's coming, or &s;atisfy their own Curio&s;ity, throng'd to that Place; &s;o that at fir&s;t I found it very difficult to get a Lodging.</P>
<P>The Prince appeared upon the Walks, went into the Raffling Shops, and $o e|very body &s;ee him, and went away, with the Duke of Dor&s;et, and o h$r of his Attendance for Por$&s;mouth; &s;o in two or three Days, things retu$$ed all to their Antient Chan I, and Tunbridge was ju&s;t what it u&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>The Ladies that appear here, are in|deed the glory of the Place, the coming to the Wells to drink the Water is a meet matter of Cu&s;tom; &s;ome drink, more do not, and few drink Phi&s;ically: But Com|pany and Diver$on $s in &s;hort the main bu&s;ine&s;s of the Place; and tho&s;e People who have nothing to do any where $word$, &s;eem to be the only People who have a$y thing to do at Tunbridge.</P>
<P>After the Appearance is over at the Wells, (where the Ladies are all undre&s;|&s;ed) and at the Chapel, the Company go home; and as if it was an ther Species of People, or a Collection from another Place, you are &s;urpriz'd t$ &s;$e the Walks covered with Ladies compl$atly dre&s;s'd and gay to profu&s;ion; where rich Cl$ths, Jewels,
<PB REF="79" MS="Y">
and Beauty not to be &s;et out out by (but infinitely above) Ornament, dazzles the Eyes from one end of the Range to the other.</P>
<P>Here you have all Liberty of Con|ver&s;ation in the World, and any thing that looks like a Gentleman, has an ad|dre&s;s agreeable, and behaves with de|cency and good Manners, may &s;ingle out whom he plea&s;es, that does not ap|pear engag'd, and may talk, rally, be merry, and &s;ay any decent thing to to them; but all this makes no Acquain|tance, nor is taken &s;o, or under&s;tood to mean &s;o; if a Gentleman de&s;ires to be more intimate, and enter into any Acquaintance particular he mu&s;t do it by proper Application, not by the Ladies will ask no Gentleman there, to go off of the Walk, or invite any one to their Lodgings, except it be a &s;ort of Ladies of whom I am not now &s;peaking</P>
<P>As for Gaming, Sharping, Intriegu|ing; as al&s;o Fops; Fools, Beaus, and the like, Tunbridge is as full of the&s;e, as can be de&s;ired, and it takes off much of the Diver&s;ion of tho&s;e Per&s;ons of Honour and Virtue, who go there to be inno|cently recreated: However a Man of Character, and good behaviour cannot be there any time, but he may &s;ingle out &s;uch Company as may be &s;uitable to him, and with whom he may be as merry as Heart can wi&s;h.</P>
<P>The Air here is excellent good, the Country Healthful, and the Provi&s;ions of all &s;orts very rea&s;onable, Particular|ly, they are &s;upply'd with excellent Fi&s;h, and that of almo&s;t all &s;orts, from Rye, and other Towns on the Sea-Coa&s;t; and I &s;aw a Turbut of near 20 l. weight told there for 3 s.: In the Sea&s;on of Mack|arel, they have them here from Ha&s;t|ings, within three Hours of their being taken out of the Sea, and the difference which that makes in their goodne&s;s, I need not mention.</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e here abundance of Wild-Fowl, of the be&s;t &s;orts; &s;uch as Phea&s;ant, Partridge, Woodcock, Snipe, Quails, Duck, Mallard, Teal &amp;c. par|ticularly they have from the South-Dows, the Bird call'd a Wheatear, or as we may call them, the Engli&s;h Ortolans, the mo&s;t delicious Ta&s;te for a Creature of one Mouthful, for 'tis little more, that can be imagin'd; but the&s;e are very dear at Tunbridge, they are much Cheaper at Seaford, Lewis, and that &s;ide of the Country.</P>
<P>In a word, Tunbridge wants nothing that can add to the Felicities of Life, or that can make a Man or Woman com|pleatly happy, always provided they have Money; for without Money a Man is no-body at Tunbridge, any more than at any other Place; and when any Man finds his Pockets low, he has nothing left to think of but to be gone, for he will have no Diver&s;ion in &s;taying there any longer.</P>
<P>And yet at Tunbridge al&s;o is a Place in which a Lady however Virtuous, yet for want of good Conduct may as &s;oon Shipwreck her Character as in any part of England, and where, when &s;he has once injur'd her Reputation, 'tis as hard to re&s;tore it; nay, &s;ome &s;ay no Lady ever recover'd her Character at Tunbride, if &s;he fir&s;t wounded it there: But this is to be added too, that a Lady very &s;eldom &s;uffers that way at Tunbridge, without &s;ome apparent Folly of her own; for that they do not &s;eem &s;o apt to make havock of one another's Reputation here, by Tattle and Slander, as I think they do in &s;ome other Places in the World; par|ticularly at Ep&s;ome, Hamp&s;tead, and &s;uch like Places; which I take to be be|cau&s;e the Company who frequent Tun|bridge, &s;eem to be a Degree or two a|bove the Society of tho&s;e other Places, and therefore are not &s;o very apt, either to meddle with other Peoples Affairs, or to Cen&s;ure if they do; both which are the Properties of that more Go&s;&s;iping Part of the World.</P>
<P>In this I &s;hall be much mi&s;under&s;tood, if it is thought I mean the Ladies only, for I mu&s;t own I look ju&s;t the other way; and if I may be allow'd to u&s;e my own Sex &s;o Cour&s;ly, it is really among them that the Ladies Characters fir&s;t, and oftne&s;t receive unju&s;t Wounds; and I
<PB REF="80" MS="Y">
mu&s;t con$$&s;s the Malice, the Reflections, the bu&s;y Meddling the Cen&s;uring, the Tatling from Place to Place, and the making havock of the Characters of in|nocent Women, is found among the Men Go&s;&s;ips more then among their own Sex, and at the Coffee-hou&s;es more than at the Tea-Table; then among the Women them&s;elves, what is to be found of it there, is more among the Cham|ber-Maids, than among their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; &s;lander is a meane&s;s below Per&s;ons of Honour and Quality, and $o do inju&s;tice to the Ladies, e&s;pecially, is a Degree below tho&s;e who have any &s;hare of Breeding and Sen&s;e: On this account you may ob&s;erve, 'tis more practis'd a|mong the Citizens than among the Gentry, and in Country Towns and Vil|leges more than in the City, and &s;o on, till you come to the meer Canail, the common Mob of the Street, and there, no Reputation, no Character can &s;hine without having Dirt thrown upon it every Day: But this is a digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I left Tunbridge, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on that I give, why others &s;hould leave it, when they are in my Condition; namely, that I found my Money almo&s;t gone; and tho' I had Bills of Credit to &s;upply my &s;elf in the Cour&s;e of my intended Journey; yet I had none there; &s;o I came away, or as they call it there, I retir'd; and came to Lewis, through the deepe&s;t, dir|tie&s;t, but many ways the riche&s;t, and mo&s;t profitable Country in all that part of England.</P>
<P>The Timber I &s;aw here was prodigi|ous, as well in quantity as in bigne&s;s, and &s;eem'd in &s;ome Places to be &s;uffer'd to grow, only becau&s;e it was &s;o far off of any Navigation, that it was not worth cutting down and carrying away; in dry Summers, indeed a great deal is car|ry'd away to Maid&s;tone, and other Pla|ces on the Medway; and &s;ometimes I have &s;een one Tree on a Carriage, which they call there a Tug, drawn by Two and Twenty Oxen, and even then, 'tis carry'd &s;o little a way, and then thrown down, and left for other Tugs to take up and carry on, that &s;ometimes 'tis Two or Three Years before it gets to Chat|ham; for if once the Rains come in, it &s;tirs no more that Year, and &s;ometimes a whole Summer is not dry enough to make the Roads pa&s;&s;able: Here I had a &s;ight, which indeed I never &s;aw in any other Part of England: Namely, that going to Church at a Church at a Coun|try Village, not far from Lewis, I &s;aw an ancient Lady, and a Lady of very good Quality, I a&s;&s;ure you, drawn to Church in her Coach with Six Oxen; nor was it done in Frolick or Humour, but meer Nece&s;&s;ity, the Way being &s;o &s;tiff and deep, that no Hor&s;es could go in it.</P>
<P>Lewis is a fine plea&s;ant Town, well built, agreeably &s;ituated in the middle of an open Champaign Country and on the Edge of the South Downs, the plea&s;ante&s;t, and mo&s;t delightful of their kind in the Nation; it lies on the Bank of a little whol&s;om fre&s;h River, within Twelve Miles of the Sea; but that which adds to the Character of this Town, is, that both the Town and the Country adja|cent, is full of Gentlemen of good Fa|milies and Fortunes of which the Pel|hams may be named with the fir&s;t, who&s;e Chief was by King William made a Baron, and who&s;e elde&s;t Son &s;ucceed|ing to the greate&s;t part of the E&s;tate of that Engli&s;h Cra&s;&s;us, the late Duke of Newca&s;tle, has &s;ince brought the Title and Honour of Newca&s;tle to the Hou&s;e; of Pelham. Here are al&s;o the ancient Families of Gage, Sh$$y, &amp;c. formerly Roman, but now Prote&s;tant, wi$h many others</P>
<P>From this Town, following &s;till the Range of the South Downs, We&s;t; we ride in view of the Sea, and on a fine Carpet Ground, for about Twelve Miles to Bright Helm&s;ton, commonly call'd Bredhem&s;ton, a Poor fi&s;hing Town old Built, and on the very edge of the Sea: Here again, as I mention'd at Folk&s;tone and Dover, the Fi&s;hermen having large Barks go away to Yarmouth, on the Coa&s;t of Norfolk, to the Fi&s;hing $air there, and hire them&s;elves &s;ot the Sea&s;on to Catch Herrings for the Merchants; and
<PB REF="81" MS="Y">
they tell us, that the&s;e make a very good Bu&s;ine&s;s of it.</P>
<P>The Sea is very unkind to this Town, and has, by its continual Encroachments, &s;o gain'd upon them, that in a little Time more, they might rea&s;onably ex|pect it would eat up the whole Town, above a Hundred Hou&s;es having been devoured by the Water in a few Years pa&s;t; they are now obliged to get a Brief granted them, to beg Money all over England, to rai&s;e Banks again&s;t the Water; the Expence of which, the Brief expre&s;sly &s;ays, will be eight Thou&s;and Pounds; which if one were to look on the Town, would &s;eem to be more than all the Hou&s;es in it are worth.</P>
<P>From thence, &s;till keeping the Coa&s;t clo&s;e on the Town, we come to S$ore|ham, a Sea-faring Town, and chiefly in|habitted by Ship Carpenters, Ship Chand|lers, and all the &s;everal Trades depend|ing upon the Building and Fitting up of Ships, which is their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s; and they are fam'd for neat Building, $nd for Building good Sea-Boats; that $s to &s;ay, Ships that are whole&s;ome in $he Sea, and good Sailors; but for &s;trong Building, they do not come up to Yar|nouth, Ip&s;wich, and the North.</P>
<P>The Builders of Ships &s;eemed to plant $ere, chiefly, becau&s;e of the exceeding Quantity and Cheapne&s;s of Timber in $he Country behind them; being the $ame wooded Country I mentioned a|$ove, which &s;till continues through this County, and the next al&s;o: The River his Town &s;tands upon, though not Na|igable for large Ve&s;&s;els, yet &s;erves them $o bring down this large Timber in Floats $om Bramber, Stenning, and the Coun|$y adjacent; which is as it were all co|$ered with Timber</P>
<P>Here, in the Compa&s;s of about &s;ix $iles, are three Borough Towns, &s;end|$g Members to Parliament, viz. Shore|$m, Bramber, and Stennings: Shore|$m and Stenning are tollerable little $arket-Towns; but Bramber (a little $uin of an old Ca&s;tle excepted) hardly $&s;erves the Name of a Town, having $t above 15 or 16 Families in it, and of them not many above asking you an Alms as you ride by; the chiefe&s;t Hou&s;e in the Town is a Tavern, and here, as I have been told, the Vintner, or Ale-Hou&s;e-Keeper rather, for he hardly de|&s;erves the Name of a Vintner, boa&s;ted, that upon an Election (ju&s;t then over) he had made 300 l. of one Pipe of Ca|nary.</P>
<P>This is the &s;econd Town in this Coun|ty, where the Elections have been &s;o &s;candalou&s;&s;y Mercenary; and of whom it is &s;aid, there was, in one King's Reign, more Money &s;pent in Elections, than all the Lands in the Pari&s;hes were worth, at Twenty Years Purcha&s;e; the other Town, I mean, is Winchel&s;ea, a Town, if it de&s;erves the Name of a Town, which is rather the Skeleton of an antient City than a real Town, where the antient Gates &s;tand near three Miles from one another over the Fields, and where the Ruins are &s;o bury'd that they have made good Corn Fields of the Streets, and the Plow goes over the $oundations, nay, over the fir&s;t Floo$s of the Hou&s;e, and where nothing of a Town but the De&s;truction of it &s;eems to remain; yet at one Election for this Town the Strife was &s;uch, between Sir John Banks, Father-in-Law to the Earl of Aylesford, and Colonel Draper, a neighbouring Gentleman, that I was told in the Country, the latter &s;pent 11000 l. at one Election, and yet lo&s;t it too; what the other &s;pent who oppo&s;ed him, may be gue&s;&s;ed at, &s;eeing he that &s;pent mo&s;t was always &s;ure to carry it in tho&s;e Days.</P>
<P>Bramber is the very Exemplification of this, with this difference only, namely, that at the former they have given it over, at the latter it &s;eems to be rather wor&s;e than ever.</P>
<P>Near Stenning, the famous Sir John Fagg had a no$le antient Seat, now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, with a va&s;t E&s;t$te, by his Grand&s;on, Sir Rober Fagg, but I men|tion the antient Gentleman on this occa|&s;ion, that being entertained at his Hou&s;e, in the Year 1697, he &s;howed me, in his Park, &s;ome Bullocks of his own
<PB REF="82" MS="Y">
Breeding, and of his own Feeding, of &s;o prodigious a &s;ize, and &s;o exce&s;&s;ively over-grown by Fat, that I never &s;aw any thing like them; and the Bullock which Sir Edward Blacket, in York&s;hire, near Rippon, Fed, and cau&s;ed to be &s;hew'd about for a Sight at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, was not any way equal to the lea&s;t of them, nor had it &s;o much Fle&s;h on it by near Twenty Stone a Quar|ter.</P>
<P>While I continu'd at Sir John's, &s;ome London Butchers came down to &s;ee them, and in my hearing offer'd Sir John Six and Twenty Pound a Head for them, but he refu&s;ed it; and when I mov'd him afterward to take the Money, he &s;aid No, he was re&s;ov'd to have them to Smithfield him&s;elf, that he might &s;ay he had the four bigge&s;t Bullocks in Eng|land at Market.</P>
<P>He continued po&s;itive, and did go up to Smithfield Market with them; but whether it was that they &s;unk a little in the driving, or that the Butchers play'd a little upon him, I cannot tell; but he was obliged to &s;ell them for Twenty Five Pound a Head when he came there: I knew one of the Butchers that bought them, and on a particular Occa&s;ion en|quir'd of him what they weigh'd when kill'd, and he a&s;&s;ur'd me that they weigh'd eighty Stone a Quarter, when kill'd and cut out; which is &s;o incredible, that if I had not been well a&s;&s;ur'd of the Truth of it, I &s;hould not have ventur'd thus to have record it: But by this may be judg'd &s;omething of the largene&s;s of the Cattle in the Wild of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex, for it is all the &s;ame, of which I men|tion'd &s;omething before, and for this rea&s;on I tell the Story.</P>
<P>From hence we come to Arundel, a decay'd Town al&s;o; but &s;tanding near the Mouth of a good River, call'd Arun, which &s;ignifies, &s;ays Mr. Cambden, the &s;wift, tho' the River it &s;elf is not &s;uch a Rapid Current as merits that Name; at lea&s;t it did not &s;eem to be &s;o to me.</P>
<P>The principal advantage to the Coun|try from this River, is the Shipping off great quantities of large Timber here which is carry'd up the Thames to Wool|wich and Deptford, and up the Med|way to Chatham; as al&s;o We&s;tward to Port&s;mouth, and even to Plymouth, to the New Dock there, this is to &s;ay, it goes to all the King's Yards, where the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Navy is carry'd on: The Timber &s;hipped off here is e&s;teem'd the be&s;t, as it is al&s;o the large&s;t that is brought by Sea from any part of England; al&s;o great quantities of Knee Timber is had here, which is valuable in its kind above the &s;trait Timber, being not only nece&s;&s;ary, but &s;carce, I mean that which is very large.</P>
<P>This River, and the old decay'd, once famous Ca&s;tle as Arundel, which are &s;till belonging to the Family of Howards, Earl of Arundel, a Branch of the Norfolk Family, is all that is remrrkable here; except it be that in this River are catch'd the be&s;t Mullets, and the large&s;t in Eng|land, a Fi&s;h very good in it &s;elf, and of|ten up to London.</P>
<P>From hence to the City of Chiche|&s;ter Twelve Miles, and the mo&s;t plea|&s;ant beautiful County in England, whe|ther we go by the Hill, that is the Downs, or by the Plain (viz.) the en|clo&s;ed Country. To the North of A|rundel, and at the bottom of the Hills, and con&s;equently in the Wild, is the Town of Petworth, a large hand&s;ome Country Market Town, and very popu|lous, and as it &s;tands upon an A&s;cent, and is dry and healthy, it is full of Gen|tlemens Families, and good well built Hou&s;es both in the Town and Neigh|bourhood; but the beauty of Petworth, is the ancient Seat of the old Family of Peircy, Earls of Northumberland now extinct; who&s;e Daughter, the &s;ole Heire&s;s of all his va&s;t E&s;tates, marry'd the pre&s;ent Duke of Somer&s;et; of the noble and ancient Family of S$ymou$ and among other noble Seats brough his Grace this of Petworth.</P>
<P>The Duke pull'd down the ancie$ Hou&s;e, and on the &s;ame Spot has bui$ from the Ground, one of the fine&s;t Pile of Building, and the be&s;t model'd Hou&s;e
<PB REF="83" MS="Y">
then in Britain: It has had the Misfor|tune to be once almo&s;t demoli&s;h'd by Fire, but the damage is fully repair'd; but another Di&s;a&s;ter to the Family can never be repaired which has happen'd to it, even while the&s;e Sheets were writ|ing: Namely, the Death of the Dutche&s;s, who dy'd in November 1722, and lies buried in the Burying Place of the Fa|mily of Seymour, Dukes of Some$$et, in in the Cathedral Church of Salisbury.</P>
<P>Her Grace was happy in a numerous I&s;&s;ue, as well as in a noble E&s;tate; and be&s;ides two Sons and one Daughter, which lie bury d with her, has left one Son and&mdash;Daughters &s;till living. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention the Nor|thumberland E&s;tate again, when I come to &s;peak of the other fine Seats, which the Duke enjoys in right of his late Dutche&s;s, and the old Ca&s;tles which were formerly part of that Northumberland E&s;tate.</P>
<P>The Duke's Hou&s;e at Petworth is certainly a compleat Building in it&s;elf, and the Apartments are very noble, well contriv'd, and richly furni&s;h'd, but it cannot be &s;aid, that the Situation of the Hou&s;e is equally de&s;ign'd, or with equal Judgment as the re&s;t; the Avenues to the Front went &s;pace, the Hou&s;e &s;tands as it were with its Elbow to the Town its Front has no Vi&s;to an&s;werable, and the We&s;t Front look'd not to the Parks on fine Gardens, but to the old Stables.</P>
<P>To rectify this, when it was too late $o order it any other way, the Duke was $blig'd to pull down tho&s;e noble Build|$ngs: I mean the $$ws, or Stables, the $ne&s;t of their kind in all the South of England and equal to &s;ome Noblemens $hole Hou&s;es, and yet even the demo|$&s;hing the Pile has done no more than pen'd a Pro&s;pect over the Country, $hereas had the Hou&s;e been &s;et on the $&s;ing Ground, on the &s;ide of the Park, ver-again&s;t the North Wing of the $ou&s;e, and a little more to the We&s;t|$ard, the Front had been South to the $own, the back Front to the Parks, $hich were capable of Fountains, Ca|nals, Vi&s;tos, and all the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Pieces of Art, that &s;ets out the fine&s;t Gardens, whereas all now lies on one Angle, or oppo&s;ite to one Wing of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But with all the&s;e di&s;advantages, the Hou&s;e it&s;elf is a noble Pile of Building, and by far the fine&s;t in all this Part of Britain. From Petwo th We&s;t, the Coun|try is a little le&s;s Woody than the Wild, and there begin to &s;how their Heads above the $$ees, a great many fine Seats of the Nobility and Gentlemen of the Country, as the Duke of Richmond's Seat at Goodwood, near Chiche&s;ter, (This Family al&s;o is in Tears, at the writing the&s;e Sheets, for the Death of her Grace the Dutche&s;s, who dyed the beginning of the Month of December, and is bury'd in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey; and here the Year clo&s;ing I think 'tis very remarkable, that this Year 1722, no l$$s than five Dukes and two Dutche&s;|&s;es are dead (viz) The Dukes of Bucks, Bolton, Ru land Manche&s;ter, and Marl|borough and the Dutche&s;&s;es of Somer&s;et and Richmond; be&s;ides Earls, viz. the Earl of Sunderland, of Stamford, Exeter, and others; and &s;ince the above was written to the Pre&s;s, the Duke of Rich|mond is al&s;o Dead.) The Seats of the late Earl of Tankerville, and the Earl of Scarboro$gh, the ancient Hou&s;e of the Lord Montacu e at Midhur&s;t, an ancient Family of the Sirname of Brown, the elde&s;t Branch of the Hou&s;e. There and a great many more lying &s;o near toge|ther, make the Country hereabout much more &s;ociable and plea&s;ant then the re&s;t of the Woody Country, call'd The Wild, of which I have made mention &s;o often; and yet I cannot &s;ay much for the City of Chiche&s;ter, in which, if Six or Seven good Families were removed, there would not be much Conver&s;ation, except what is to be found among the Canons, and Dignitaries of the Cathedral.</P>
<P>The Cathedral here is not the fine&s;t in England, but is far from being the mo&s;t ordinary: The Spire is a Piece of excel|lent Wor man&s;hip, but it received &s;uch
<PB REF="84" MS="Y">
a &s;hock &s;ome Years ago, that it was next to miraculous, that the whole Stee|ple did not fall down; which in &s;hort, if it had, would almo&s;t have demoli&s;h'd the whole Church.</P>
<P>It was a Fire-Ball, if we take it from the Inhabitants, or, to &s;peak in the Lan|guage of Nature, the Lightning broke upon the Steeple, and &s;uch was the ir|re&s;i&s;tible force of it, that it drove &s;everal great Stones out of the Steeple, and car|ry'd them clear off, not from the Roof of the Church only, but of the adjacent Hou&s;es al&s;o, and they were found at a prodigious di&s;tance from the Steeple, &s;o that they mu&s;t have been &s;hot out of the places where they &s;tood in the Stee|ple, as if they had been $$ot out of a Can|non, or blown out of a Mine: One of the&s;e Stones of at lea&s;t a Ton weight&punc; by E&s;timation, was blown over the South &s;ide, or row of Hou&s;es in the We&s;t &s;treet, and fell on the Ground in the Street at a Gentleman's Door, on the other &s;ide of the way; and another of them almo&s;t as big was blown over both &s;ides of the &s;aid We&s;t &s;treet, into the &s;ame Gentle|man's Garden, at who&s;e Door the other Stone lay, and no hurt was done by either of them; whereas if either of tho&s;e Stones had fallen upon the &s;tronge&s;t built Hou&s;e in the Street, it would have da&s;h'd it all to pieces, even to the Foun|dation: This account of the two Stones, I relate from a Per&s;on of undoubted Cre|dit, who was an Eye-Witne&s;s, and &s;aw them, but had not the Curio&s;ity to mea&s;ure them, which he was very &s;orry for. The breach it made in the Spire, tho' within about Forty Five Foot of the top, was &s;o large, that as the Work|men &s;aid to me, a Coach and Six Hor&s;es might have driven through it, and yet the Steeple &s;tood fa&s;t, and is now very &s;ub&s;tantially repair'd; withal, &s;howing that it was before, an admirable &s;ound and well fini&s;hed piece of Workman|&s;hip.</P>
<P>They have a Story in this City, that whenever a Bi&s;hop of that Dioce&s;e is to Dye, a Heron comes and &s;its upon the Pinnacle of the Spire of the Cathedral; This accordingly happen d, about&mdash;when Dr.&mdash;Williams was Bi&s;hop; A Butcher &s;tanding at his Shop-Door, in the South-&s;treet, &s;aw it, and ran in for for his Gun, and being a good Marks. Man &s;hot the Heron, and kill'd it, at which his Mother was very angry with him, and &s;aid, he had kill'd the Bi&s;hop, and the next Day News came to the Town that Dr. Williams, the la&s;t Bi&s;hop was dead; this is affirm'd by many Peo|ple Inhabi$ants of the Place.</P>
<P>This City is not a Place of much Trade, nor is it very Populous; but they are lately fal$en into a very particular way of managing the Corn Trade here which it is &s;aid turns $ery well to account, the Country round it is very Fruitful, and par$$ ularly in good Wneat, and the $word$ generally &s;p$aking carry'd all $word$ $word$ t $o $word$ o M$ke$ which is ve$y nea$ forty Mil$ by $$nd C$$$iage, and from &s;ome $word$ of the Country more than forty Miles.</P>
<P>But &s;ome Money'd Men of Chi$he&s;ter, Em&s;wo$ h, and o$he$ Places ad$$cent, have join'd their S$ocks together built large Granaries near the C$ook, where the Ve&s;&s;e$s come up&punc; and here they buy and lay up all the Corn which the Coun|try on that &s;ide can &s;pare; and having good Mills in the Neighbourhood, they grind and dre&s;s the Corn, and &s;end it to London in the Meal about by Long Sea, as they call it; nor now the War is over do they make the Voyage &s;o tedious as to do the Meal any hurt, as at fir&s;t in the time of War was &s;ometimes the Ca&s;e for want of Convoys.</P>
<P>It is true, this is a great le&s;&s;ening to Farnham Market, but that is of no con|&s;ideration in the Ca&s;e; for, if the Mar|ket at London is &s;upply'd, the coming by Sea from Chiche&s;ter is every jot as much a publick good, as the encouraging of Farnham Market, which is of it&s;elf the greate&s;t Corn Market in England, Lon|don excepted. Notwith&s;tanding all the decrea&s;e from this &s;ide of the Country, this carrying of Meal by
<PB REF="85">
Sea met with &s;o ju&s;t an Encouragement from hence, that it is now practi&s;ed from &s;everal other Places on this Coa&s;t, even as far as Hampton.</P>
<P>From Chiche&s;ter, the Road lying &s;till We&s;t, pa&s;&s;es in View of the Earl of Scar|borough's fine Seat at Stan&s;ted, a Hou&s;e &s;eeming to be a retreat, being &s;urround|ed with thi k Woods, through which there are the mo&s;t plea&s;ant agreeable Vi|&s;to's cut that are to be &s;een any where in England, particularly, becau&s;e through the We&s;t opening, which is from the Front of the Hou&s;e they &s;i$ in the Din+ing Room of the Hou&s;e, and &s;ee the Town and Harbour of Port&s;mouth, the Ships Spithead, and al&s;o at St. Helens; which, when the Royal Navy happens to be there, as often happened during the late War, is a mo&s;t glorious Sight.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e was fatal to Dr. Williams, mentioned above, Bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, who having been here to make a Vi&s;it to the late Earl of Scarborough, was thrown out of his Coach, or rather threw him&s;elf out, being frighted by the unru|line&s;s of his Hor&s;es, and broke his Leg in the Fall, which, his Lord&s;hip being in Years, was Mortal to him: He dy'd in a few days after.</P>
<P>From hence we de&s;cend gradually to Port&s;mouth, the large&s;t Fortification, be|yond compari&s;on, that we have in Eng|$and but it was not with any Con&s;idera|$sion, that the Author before recited could &s;ay, it was the only regular Fortification in England; e&s;pecially the &s;ame Writer owning afterwards that Shirene&s;s, Lan|guardfort, and Tilbury, were all regu|lar Fortifications, as they really are.</P>
<P>The Situation of this Place is &s;uch, hat it is cho&s;en, as may well be &s;aid, or the be&s;t Security to the Navy above ll the Places in Britain; the Entrance nto the Harbour is &s;afe, but very nar|ow, guarded on both Sides by terrible latforms Cannon, particularly on the oint; which is a Suburb of Port&s;mouth $operly &s;o called, where there is a Brick latform built with two Tire of Guns, $e over another, and which can Fire in Cover, that the Gunners cannot be beaten from their Guns, or their Guns ea&s;ily di&s;mounted; the other is from the Point of Land on the &s;ide of Go&s;port, which they call Gilkicker, where al&s;o they have two Batteries.</P>
<P>Before any Ships attempt to enter this Port by Sea, they mu&s;t al&s;o pa&s;s the Cannon of the main Platform of the Garri&s;on, and al&s;o another at South-Sea-Ca&s;tle, &s;o that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible that any Ships could match the Force of all tho&s;e Cannon, and be able to force their way into the Harbour; in which I &s;peak the Judgment of Men well ac|quainted with &s;uch Matters, as well as my own Opinion, and of Men who&s;e Opinion leads them to thin$ the be&s;t of the Force of Naval Batteries too; and who have talk'd of making no Difficulty to Force their way through the Thames in the Teeth of the Line of Guns at Tilbury; I &s;ay, they have talk'd of it, but it was but talk, as any one of Judg|ment would imagin, that knew the Works at Tilbury, of which I have &s;po|ken in its Place: The rea&s;on however, which they give for the Difference, have &s;ome Force in them, as they relate to Port&s;mouth, though not as they relate to Tilbury; viz. That the Mouth, or Entrance into Port&s;mouth is narrow, and may be locked up with Boombs, which before the Ships could break, and while they were lying at them to break them away, they would be torn in Pieces by the Battery at the Point: (next) That the Guns on the &s;aid Battery at the Point at Port&s;mouth, are defended as above with Ambruziers, and the Gun|ners &s;tand cover'd, &s;o that they cannot &s;o &s;oon be beaten from their Guns, or their Guns &s;o &s;oon di&s;mounted by the warm Quarter of a three Deck Ship, as at Tilbury, where all the Gunners and Guns too mu&s;t &s;tand open, both to &s;mall and great Shot: Be&s;ides, at Tilbury, while &s;ome of the Ships lay Battering the Fort, others would pa&s;s behind them, clo&s;e under the Town, and if one or more received Damage from the Fort, the re&s;t would pa&s;s in the Cloud of Smoke, and perhaps might compa&s;s their
<PB REF="86" MS="Y">
De&s;ign, as is the Ca&s;e in all Places, where the Entrance is broad: whereas at Port&s;mouth, they would be battered within little more than Pi&s;tol &s;hot, and from both &s;ides of the Way, whereas at Tilbury there are very few Guns on the Grave&s;end &s;ide of the River</P>
<P>But to avoid comparing of Strengths, or &s;aying what may be done in one Place, and not done in another; 'tis e|vident, in the Opinion of all that I have met with, that the greate&s;t Fleet of Ships that ever were in the Hands of one Nation at a Time, would not pre|tend, if they had not an Army al&s;o on Shoar, to attack the whole Work, to force their Entrance into the Harbour of Port&s;mouth.</P>
<P>As to the Strength of the Town by Land, the Works are very large and numerous, and be&s;ides the Battery at the Point afore&s;aid, there is a large Horn|work on the South-&s;ide, running out towards South Sea Ca&s;tle; there is al o a good Counter&s;carp, and double Mote, with Ravelins in the Ditch, and double Palli&s;adoes, and advanc'd Works to co|ver the Place from any approach, where it may be practicable. The Strength of the Town is al&s;o con&s;iderably augment|ed on the Land &s;ide, by the Fortifica|tions rai&s;ed in King William's Time, about the Docks and Yards, which are now perfected, and tho&s;e Parts made a particular Strength by them&s;elves; and though they are indeed, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, independent one of another, &s;o at that they cannot be &s;eparately atracked on that &s;ide, while they are both in the &s;ame Hands.</P>
<P>The&s;e Docks and Yards are now like a Town by them&s;elves, and are a kind of Marine Corporation, or a Govern|ment of their own kind within them|&s;elves; there being particular large rows of dwellings, built at the publick Charge, within the New Works, for all the prin|cipal Officers of the Place; e&s;pecially the Commi&s;&s;ioner, the Agent of the Victu|alling, and &s;uch as the&s;e; the Trade&s;|men likewi&s;e have Hou&s;es here, and many of the Labourers are allowed to live in the bounds as they can get Lodg|ing.</P>
<P>The Town of Port&s;mouth, be&s;ides its being a Fortification, is a well inhabited thriving, pro&s;perous Corporation; and hath been greatly enrich'd of late by the Fleet's having &s;o often and &s;o long lain there, as well as large Flee s of Merchant Men, as the whole Navy $word$ the late War; be&s;ides the $word$ fitting out of Men here, and he of $word$ paying them at Port&s;mouth, h s m d a great Confluence of People t $ $er on their private Bu&s;ine&s;s, with other things, which the Attendance on tho&s;e Fleets hath required: The&s;e things have not only been a great Advantage to the Town, but has really made the whole Place Rich&punc; and the Inhabitants of Port&s;|mouth are quite another fort of People than they were a few Years before the Revolution; this is what Mr. Camden takes notice of, even &s;o long ago as the Reign of Queen Elizabeth&punc; that Port&s;|mouth was Populous in time of War; but not &s;o in time of Peace. But now the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Navy is &s;o much en|crea&s;ed, and &s;o much of it always done here, that it may be &s;aid, there is as much to do at Port&s;mouth now in time of Peace, as there was then in time of War, and more too.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o this Note to be put upon the two great Ar&s;enals of England, Port&s;|mouth, and Chatham; namely, That they thrive by a War, as the War re&s;pects their Situation, viz. That wh n a War with France happens, or with Spain, h$n Port&s;mouth grows Rich, and when a War with Holland, or any of the Powers of the North, then Ch tham, and $ool|wich, and Deptfort, are in reque&s;t; but of this I &s;hall &s;peak again, when I came to &s;peak of the like Antithe&s;is between Plymouth and the Humber, or Port&s;mouth and the Firth of Ed nburgh.</P>
<P>The Government of the Place is by a Mayor and Aldermen, &amp;c. as in other Corporations, and the Civil Government is no more interrup ed by the Military, th n if there was no Garri&s;on there, &s;uch is the good Conduct of the Governors, and
<PB REF="87">
&s;uch it has always been &s;ince our Sove|reigns have ceas'd to encourage the Sol|diery to in&s;ult the Civil Magi&s;trates: And we have very &s;eldom had any Com|plaint on either &s;ide, either of want of Di&s;cipline among the Soldiers, or want of Prudence in the Magi&s;trates. The In|habitants indeed nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubmit to &s;uch Things as are the Con&s;equence of a Garri&s;on Town, &s;uch as being examin'd at the Gates, &s;uch as being obliged to keep Garri&s;on Hours, and not be let out, o$ let in after Nine a Clock at Night, and the like; but the&s;e are Things no People will count a Burthen, where they get their Bread by the very Situation of the Place, as is the ca&s;e here</P>
<P>Since the encrea&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s at this Place by the long continuance of the War, the Confluence of People has been &s;o great, and the Town not admitting any enlargement for Buildings, that a kind of a Suburb, or rather a new Town has been built on the healthy Ground adjoining to the Town, which is &s;o well built, and &s;eems to encrea&s;e &s;o fa&s;t, that in time it threatens to outdo for Num|bers of inhabitants, and beauty of Build|ings, even the Town it&s;elf; and parti|cularly by being unconfined by the Laws of the Garri&s;on, as above, and unencum|bered with the Corporation Burthens, Freedoms, Town Duties, Services, and the like.</P>
<P>From Port&s;mouth We&s;t, the Country lies low and &s;lat, and is full of Creeks and Inlets of the Sea and Rivers, all the way to Southampton, &s;o that we Ferry over three times in about eighteen Miles; be&s;ides going over one Bridge, namely, at Ti$hfield, The fir&s;t of the&s;e Ferries is that at Port&s;mouth it&s;elf, viz. cro&s;s the Mouth of the Harbour, from the Point above-mention'd, to Go&s;port; from then$e we ride to I'ichfield, as above, where we pa&s;s the River Alre, which ri&s;es in the &s;ame Coun$y at Al|resfo$d, or$nea it, which is not above twenty-two Miles off; and yet it is a large River here, and makes a good Road below, call Tichfield Bay: Thence at about Four Miles we pa&s;s another Ri|ver at Bu&s;&s;el$on, narrow in Breadth but exceeding Deep and eminent for its being able to carry the bigge&s;t Ships: Here is a Building-Yard for Ships of War, and in King William's Time two Eighty Gun Ships were Launch'd here I &s;eems the Safety of the Creek, and the Plenty of Timber in the Country behind it, is the rea&s;on of Building &s;o much in this Place.</P>
<P>From hence when we come oppo&s;ite to Southampton, we pa&s;s another Creek, being the Mouth of the River&mdash;which comes down from Winche&s;ter, and is both very broad and deep, and the Ferrymen having a very &s;orry Boat, we found it dangerous enough pa&s;&s;ing it: On the other Bank &s;tands the an|cient Town of Southampton and on the other &s;ide of Southampton comes done another large River, entring South|ampton Water by Red-Bridge; &s;o that the Town of Southampton &s;tands up|on a Point running out into the Sea, between two very fine Rivers, both Navigable, up &s;ome length into the Country, and particularly u&s;eful for the bringidg down Timber out of one of the be&s;t Wooded Counties in Britain; for the River on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Town in particular comes by the edge of the great Fore&s;t, call'd New Fore&s;t; here we &s;aw a prodigious quantity of Timber, of an uncommon &s;ize, va&s;tly large, ly|ing on the Shoar of the River, for above two Miles in length, which they told us was brought thither from the Fore&s;t, and left there to be fetch'd by the Builders at Port&s;mouth Dock, as they had occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>In riding over the South Part of Hamp|&s;hire, I made this ob&s;ervation about that growth of Timber, which I mention in Supplement to what I &s;aid before concern|ing our Timber being wa&s;ted and decay'd in England, viz that notwith&s;tanding the very great Con&s;umption of Timber in K. William's Reign, by building or rebuilding almo&s;t the whole Navy; and norwith&s;land|ing &s;o many of the King's Ships were built hereabouts, be&s;ides abundance of

large Merchant Ships, which were about that time built at Southampton, at Red|bridge, and at Bur&s;leton, &amp;c. yet I &s;aw the Gentlemens E&s;tates, within &s;ix, eight, or ten Miles of Southampton, &s;o over|grown with Wood, and their Woods &s;o full of large full grown Timber, that it &s;eem'd as if they wanted Sale for it, and that it was of little worth to them. In one E&s;tate at Hur&s;ely in particular near Winche&s;ter, the E&s;tate &s;ince bought by Mr. Cardonell, late Manager for the Duke of Marlborough, and formerly be longing to Mr. Cromwell, Grand&s;on to Oliver Cromwell, the whole E&s;tate not above 800 l. per Ann in Rent, they might have cut Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds worth of Timber down, and yet have left the Woods in a thriving Condition; in an|other E&s;tate between that and Petersfield, of about 1000 l. per Ann. they told me they could Fella Thou&s;and Pounds a Year in good large Timber fit for Building, for twenty Years together, and do the Woods no harm: Colonel Norton al&s;o, a known Gentleman, who&s;e Seat at Southwick, is within &s;ix Miles of Port&s;mouth, and within three Miles of the Water Carriage; this Gentleman they told me had an immen&s;e quantity of Timber, &s;ome grow|ing within &s;ight of the very Docks in Port&s;mouth: Farther We&s;t it is the like, aud as I rode through New Fore&s;t, I cou'd &s;ee the ancient Oaks of many hun|dred Years &s;tanding, peri&s;hing with their wither'd Tops advanc'd up in the Air, and grown White with Age, and that could never yet get the favour to be cut dow, and made &s;erviceable to their Country.</P>
<P>The&s;e in my Opinion are no &s;igns of the decay of our Woods, or of the dan|ger of our wanting Timber in England; on the contrary, I take leave to mention it again, that if we were employ'd in England, by the re&s;t of the World, to build a Thou&s;and Sail of Three Deck Ships, from 80 to 100 Guns, it might be done to our infinite Advantage, and without putting us in any danger of ex|hau&s;ting the Nation of Timber.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give other hints of the like, when I come to &s;peak of Hertford&s;hire Buckingham&s;hire, Berk&s;hire, and the Counties which we call Inland, where the Timber is really of &s;mall Value, for want of Water Carriage to carry it away likewi&s;e again in the Counties North ward, bordering upon the Humber, and upon all the Northern Rivers, not to &s;ay a Word of Ireland; which is &s;till a Store|hou&s;e of Timber, more inexhau&s;tible if po&s;&s;ible than England.</P>
<P>Southampton is a truly ancient Town, for 'tis in a manner dying with Age; the decay of the Trade is the real decay of the Town; and all the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mo|ment that is tran&s;acted there, is the Trade between us and the I&s;lands of Jer&s;ey and Guern&s;ey, with a little of the Wine Trade, and much Smuggling: The build|ing of Ships al&s;o is much &s;top'd of late; however, the Town is, large, has many People in it, a noble fair High-&s;treet, a &s;pacious Key; and if it's Trade &s;hould revive, is able to entertain great num|bers of People: There is a French Church and no incon&s;iderable Congregation, which was a help to the Town and there are &s;till &s;ome Merchants who Trade to Newfoundland, and to the Streights with Fi&s;h; but for all other Trade, it may be &s;aid of as of other Towns, Lon|don has eaten it up. The Situation of the Town between two Rivers was to its advantage formerly in point of Strength, and the Town was Wall'd with a very &s;trong Wall, &s;trengthen'd with a Ram|part, and a double Ditch; but I do not hear that they ever were put to make much u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Whatever the Fable of Bevis of South|ampton, and the Gyants in the Woods thereabouts may deriv'd from, I found the People mighty willing to have tho&s;e Things pa&s;s for true; and at the North Gate of the Town, the only Entrance from the Land &s;ide, they have the Figures of two eminent Champions, who might pa&s;s for Gyants if they were alive now, but they can tell us very little of their His&s;tory, but what is all Fabulous like the re&s;t, &s;o I &s;ay no more of them</P>

I was now at the extent of my intend|ed Journey We&s;t, and thought of looking no farther this way for the pre&s;ent, &s;o I came away North Ea&s;t, leaving Win|che&s;ter a little on the Left, and came into the Port&s;mouth Road at Petersfield, a Town Eminent for little, but its being full of good Inns, and &s;tanding in the middle of a Country, &s;till over-grown with a prodigious quantity of Oak-Tim|ber. From hence we came to Alton, and in the Road thither, began a little to ta&s;te the Plea&s;ure of the We&s;tern Downs, which reach from Winche&s;ter almo&s;t to Alton.</P>
<P>The Duke of Bolton has two very No|ble Seats in this Country&punc; one be ween Alton and Alresford, and one at Ba&s;ing, of which hereafter. Alton is a &s;mall Market-Town, of no Nore, neither is there any con&s;iderable Manufacture in all this part of England, except a little Drugget and Shalloon making, whi h begins hereabouts, otherwi&s;e the w o&s;e Counties of Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, Su$ey, and Hamp&s;hire, are not employ'd in any con|$$derable Woollen Manufacture; what here is, I have &s;poken of a our Cran|$rook in Kent, $uilford, and Farnham Surrey, and a little in the North Part $ Bark&s;hire, all which put together, $ not equal to one ordinary Manufactu|$ng Village in E&s;&s;ex or Norfolk.</P>
<P>From Alton we came to Farnham of $hich I can only &s;ay, that it is a large $pulous Market-Town, the arthe&s;t that $ay in the County of Surrey, and with|ut exception the greate&s;t Corn-Market England, London excepted; that is &s;ay, particularly for Wheat, of which va&s;t a quan$iry is brought every Mar|$t-Day to this Market, that Gentle|$n told me, he once counted on a $arket-Day Eleven Hundred Teams of $r&s;e, all drawing Waggons, or Carts, den with Wheat at this Market; $ery Team of which is &s;uppo&s;ed to $ng what they call a Load, that is to $ Forty Bu&s;hel of Wheat to Market, $ich is in the whole, Four and Forty ou&s;and Bu&s;hel; but I do not take up|on me to affirm this Relation, to &s;ay whether it be a probable Opinion or not; I know &s;ome have thought the quantity has been much more; but this al&s;o was, I &s;uppo&s;e, before the People of Chiche&s;|ter and Em&s;worth on one &s;ide, and South|ampton Tichfield, and Redbridge on the other, took to the Trade of &s;ending their Wheat in Meal to London by Sea, as is mentioned above.</P>
<P>At this Town is a Ca&s;tle Eminent for this, that it was built by a Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; and tho' its Antiquity is evident, as far back as King Stephen; yet it remains to the Bi&s;hops of Winche&s;|ter to this Day. Here the &s;aid Bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter u&s;ually keep their ordina|ry Re&s;idence, and tho' the County of Surrey, be generally &s;peaking within the Dioce&s;s, they may be truly &s;aid to Re&s;ide in the middle of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Do|minion. The Farnham People it &s;eems, or &s;ome of the Country Folks, notwith|&s;tanding the Liberality and Bounty of the &s;everal Bi&s;hops, who, if &s;ome People may be believ'd, have been very good Benefactors to the Town; I &s;ay, not|with&s;tanding all this, have of late been very unkind $o the Bi&s;hop, in pulling down the Pale of his Park, and plunder|ing it of the Deer, Killing, Wounding, and Di&s;abling, even tho&s;e they cou'd not carry away.</P>
<P>From Farnham, that I might take in the whole County of Surrey, I took the Coach-Road, over Bag&s;hot-Heath, and that great Fore&s;t, as 'tis call'd of Wind|&s;or; Tho&s;e that de&s;pi&s;e Scotland, and the North Part of England, for being full of Wa&s;t and Barren Land, may take a view of this part of Surrey, and look upon it as a Foil to the Beauty of the the re&s;t of England; or a Mark of the ju&s;t re&s;entment &s;hew'd by Heaven upon the Engli&s;hmen's Pride; I mean the-Pride they&s;hew in boa&s;ting of their Coun|try, its Fruitfulne&s;s, Plea&s;antne&s;s, Rich|ne&s;s, the Fertility of the Soil, &amp;c. where as here is a va&s;t Tract of Land, &s;ome of it within &s;eventeen or eighteen Miles of the Capital City; which is not only
<PB REF="90" MS="Y">
Poor, but even quite &s;teril, given up to Barrenne&s;s, horrid and frightful to look on, not only good for little, but good for nothing; much of it is a Sandy De|&s;ert, and one may frequently be put in Mind here of Arabia De&s;erta, where the Winds rai&s;e the Sands, &s;o as to over|whelm whole Caravans of Travellers, Cattle and People together; for in pa&s;|&s;ing this Heath, in a Windy Day, I was &s;o far in danger of fmothering with the Clouds of Sand, which were rai&s;ed by the Storm, that I cou'd neither keep it out of my Mouth, No&s;e or Eyes; and when the Wind was over, the Sand ap|pear'd &s;pread over the adjacent Fields of the Fore&s;t &s;ome Miles di&s;tant, &s;o as that it ruins the very Soil. This Sand indeed is check'd by the Heath, or Hea|ther, which grows in it, and which is the common product of Barren Land, even in the very Highlands of Scotland; but the Ground is otherwi&s;e &s;o Poor and Barren, that the Product of it &s;eeds no Creatures, but &s;ome very &s;mall Sheep, who &s;eed chiefly on the &s;aid Heather, and but very few of the&s;e, nor are there any Villages, worth mentioning, and but few Hou&s;es, or People for many Miles far and wide; this De&s;art lyes extended &s;o much, that &s;ome &s;ay, there is not le&s;s than a Hundred Thou&s;and Acres of this Barren Land that lyes all together, reaching out every way in the Three Counties of Surrey, Hamp&s;hire and Berk|&s;hire; be&s;ides a great quantity of Land, almo&s;t as bad as that between Godal|ming and Petersfield, on the Road to Port&s;|mouth, including &s;ome Hills, call'd the Hind Head and others.</P>
<P>Thro' this De&s;art, for I can call it no le&s;s, we come into the great We&s;term Road, leading from London to Salisbu|ry, Exeter, &amp;c. and pa&s;s the Thames at Stanes; and here I could not but call to mind' upon viewing the Beautiful Pro&s;|pect of the River, and of the Meadows, on the Banks of the River, on the Left Hand of the Road, I &s;ay, I cou'd not but call to mind tho&s;e two Excellent Lines of Sir John Denhan$, in his Poem, call'd Cooper's-Hill, Viz.</P>
<Q><L>Tho' Deep, yet Clear, tho' Gentle, yet not Dull,</L>
<L>Strong without Rage, without oe'rflow|ing full.</L></Q>
<P>Here I remember'd that I had yet left the Inland Towns o the $word$ o Kent $nd Su&s;&s;ex, and almo&s;t all the County of Surrey out of my Account, and that having as it were taken a cir|cuit round the Coa&s;t only; I had a great many Places worth Viewing to g$ve an Account of; I therefore left $word$ which was within my View on out $word$ other, as bring the Subject of another Part; and re&s;olv d t fin$h $n pre$eat View, in the Order I had b gun i$&punc; That is to &s;ay, to give an Ac ount of the whole Country as I come on; that I may make no in ongruous $word$ from one remote Park of Edgland to ano|ther, at lea&s;t as few as may be.</P>
<P>From Stanes therefore I turn'd $word$ S. E. to Chert&s;ey, another Market-Town, and where there is a Bridge over the Thames: This Town was $word$ famous, by being $he Burial Place of Henry VI. till his Bones were after re|moved to Windfor by Henry VII. al&s;o by being the retreat of the $$comparable <HI>Cowley,</HI> where he liv'd withd a$$ f om the Hurries of the Court and Town, and where he dy'd &s;o much a reclu&s;e, as to be almo&s;t wholly take up in Country bu&s;ine&s;s, Farming and Hu ba dry&punc; for his Diver&s;ion, not for Bread, according to the publick flight of his ow Fancy.</P>
<P>From this Town wholly employ'd either in Malting, or in Barges $o $ar|ry it down the River to London; I went away South to Woking, a private Coun|try Market-Town, &s;o out of all Road or Thorough-fare, as we call it, that 'tis very little heard of in England $word$ claims however &s;ome Honour, from in being once the Re&s;idence of a Roya$ Branch of the Family o$ Plantagenet, th$ Old Counte&s;s of Richmond.

or rather repair'd, an Old Royal Hou&s;e, on purpo&s;e for her Re&s;idence, and where &s;he ended her Days in much Honour and Peace; the former Part of her Life having been &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed to the Storms and Dangers of the Times; e&s;pe|cially under the Tyranny and Turbulent Reign of the Two precedent Monarchs.</P>
<P>From hence we came to Guilford, a well known and con&s;iderable Market-Town: It has the Name of being the County Town, tho' it cannot properly be call'd &s;o; neither the County Goal being here, or the A&s;&s;izes, any more than in common with other Towns: But the Election indeed for Parliament Men for the County is always held here. The River which according to Mr. Cam|den is call'd the Wey, and which falls into the Thames at Oatlands, is made Navigable to this Town, which adds greatly to its Trade; and by this Na|vigation a very great quantity of Timber is brought down to London, not from the Neighbourhood of this Town only, but even from the Woody parts of Su&s;|fex and Hamp&s;hire above Thirty Miles from it, the Country Carriages bringing it hither in the Summer by Land. This Navigation is al&s;o a mighty &s;upport to the great Corn Market at Farnham, which I have mentioned &s;o often: For as the Meal-Men and other Dealers buy the Corn at that Market, much of it is brought to the Mills on this River; which is not above Seven Miles di&s;tant, and be|ing fir&s;t Ground and Dre&s;s'd, is then &s;ent down in the Meal by Barges to Lon|don; the Expence of which is very &s;mall&punc;, as is practi&s;ed on the other &s;ide of the Thames, for above Fifty Miles di&s;tance from London.</P>
<P>Here, as I ob&s;erv'd in its Place, is a &s;mall remainder of an Old Manufacture, that is to &s;ay, of the Clothing Trade, and it extends it &s;elf to Godalming, Ha&s;elmeer, and the Vale Country, on the &s;ide of the Holmwood; a Place of which I &s;hall &s;peak on another Occa&s;ion quite to Darking: The&s;e Cloths of a middling Price, have formerly been in great Repute, and then again were al|mo&s;t quite decay'd, but by the Applica|tion and Skill of the Clothiers, main|tain'd the Credit of their Make, and are encourag d, and indeed revived in Re|putation of late Years, when the Clothi|ers of Cranbrook and Tenterden in Kent, who&s;e Goods are of the &s;ame kind, are almo&s;t &s;unk to nothing, as I have alrea|dy ob&s;erved</P>
<P>This Clothing Trade, however &s;mall, is very a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Poor of this Part of the Country, where the Lands, as I have noted, are but indifferent; except ju&s;t above the great Towns, and where abundance of the Inhabitants are, what we call Cottagers, and live chiefly by the Benefit of the large Commons and Heath Ground, of which the quantity is &s;o very great</P>
<P>From this Town of Guilford, the Road to Farnham is very remarkable, for it runs along We&s;t from Guilford, upon the ridge of a high Chalky Hill, &s;o narrow that the breadth of the Road takes up the breadth of the Hill&punc; and the de$li|vity begins on either Hand, at the very Hedge that bounds the Highway, and is very &s;teep, as well as very high; from this Hill is a Pro&s;pect either way, &s;o far that 'tis &s;urpri&s;ing; and one &s;ees to the North, or N. W. over the great Black De&s;art, call'd Bag&s;hot&punc;Heath, mention|ed above, one way, and the other way South Ea&s;t into Su&s;&s;ex, almo&s;t to the South Downs, and We&s;t to an unbound|ed length, the Horizon only re&s;training the Eyes: This Hill being all Chalk, a Traveller feels the effect of it in a Hot Summer's Day, being &s;corch'd by the Reflection of the Sun from the Chalk, &s;o as to make the Heat almo&s;t in&s;upport|able, and this I &s;peak by my own Ex|perience: This Hill reaches from Guil|ford Town's End to within a Mile and half of Farnham.</P>
<P>The Hill, or the going up to it from Guilford rather, is call'd St. Katharine's-Hill, and at the Top of the A&s;cent from the Town &s;tands the Gallows, which is &s;o placed, re&s;pecting the Town, that the
<PB REF="92" MS="Y">
Towns People from the High-&s;treet may &s;it at their Shop Doors, and &s;ee the Cri|minals executed.</P>
<P>The great Road from London to Chiehe&s;ter, and from London to Port&s;|mouth, lying thro' this Town; it is con|&s;equently a Town very well furni&s;h'd wi$h Inns for Accommodation of Tra|vellers, as is Godalming, al&s;o the next Town within three Miles of it.</P>
<P>From Guildford there lies a $word$ as i$ may be call'd, to, London, $word$ frequented by Coaches or Carriers, or the ordinary Pa&s;&s;engers to London; tho' 'tis by &s;ome reckon'd the neare&s;t way, and is wi hout que&s;tion much the $word$ $word$ if it is not the $word$ in this Part of England, viz From this Town $o Letherhead, ten Miles from Letherhead to $o$don, over Ban&s;tead Downs fifteen Miles, o$ if you plea&s;e by Ep$om &s;eventeen Miles; which, tho' it is call'd the $word$ way, makes amends abundantly by the goodne&s;s of the Way, and the advantage and plea&s;antne&s;s of the Road.</P>
<P>The ten Miles from Guildford to Le|therhead make one continued Line of Gentlemens Hou&s;es, lying all, or mo&s;t of them, on the We&s;t $word$ of the Road, and their Parks o$ Gardens almo&s;t touch|ing one another: Here are plea&s;antly &s;eated $word$ very con&s;iderable Per&s;ons, as the P$&s;terity of $span$ Bludworth, once Lord Mayor of London, a Per&s;on famous for the $word$ Pa&s;&s;ion he put the People of London in, by one $a$n Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, at the time of the great Fire: viz. That it was nothing, and they might Pi&s;s it out; which was only &s;poken at the beginning of the Fire, when neither Sir Thomas or the Citizens them&s;elves cou'd fore&s;ee the length it would go; and without any de&s;ign to le&s;&s;en their endeavours to quench it: But this they nev$$ forgot, or forgave to him, or his Family after him; but fix'd the Expre&s;|&s;ion on him, as a Mark of Indelible Re|proach, even to this Day: Among the o$her fi$e S$a$s in this Row, is that of A$$hu$ Moo e, E q; at Fetch$m, where no Co&s;t has been &s;par'd to make a mo&s;t beautiful and delicious Situation, be|holden to Art, and which is &s;et out at an immen&s;e Charge: Near to Guilford, at the We&s;t End of this line of fine seats, is the antient Man&s;ion of the On&s;low'$&punc; The Father of the pre&s;ent Lord, was Sir Richard On&s;low, Bart. &s;everal Years one of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury of Admiralty; and created Baron On&s;low by K. George.</P>
<P>The Seat is old, and the E&s;tate is old too (but the latter is much the better for its Age) for it has been many Years in the Family, as appears in Mr. Camden, and has gone on encrea&s;ing from Hand to Hand. The la$e Lord Or&s;low im|prov'd and beautify'd both the Hou&s;e and the E&s;tate too very much. The Hou&s;e has &s;everal times been honour'd with the Pre&s;ence of both King William and King George; the former erected an Annual Race for a Royal Plate of 100 Guineas, call'd the King's Gold plate, to be run for every Year, and the latter has been &s;o good, as twice at lea&s;t to Honour the Diver&s;ion with his Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>At the like di&s;tance North from Guil|ford, and on the Banks of the Way, is a fine Seat, every way as fit for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Peer as is Clendon Park; and belonging to a Branch of the &s;ame Family. viz. to Dengil On&s;low, $word$ U$$le to the pre&s;ent Lord On&s;l$w, you$g|er Brother to his, F$$ther the f$$&s;t Lord&punc; This $span$ exceed|ing plea&s;ant $word$ for the mo&s;t beautiful $word$ of Wood, and Water in the P$rk, and Gardens, and Grounds $word$ by which the $o&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or, $span$ lay wonderfully in improving Lands, and making Things more plea&s;ant, brought Py$ford to &s;uch a Perfection, as to be inferior to very few, if any, of the fine&s;t Hou&s;es in Surrey; particularly in one thing, which is nor found in all that Part of England; namely, a Du$koy, which adjoins to his Park, and which makes the re&s;t inimita|bly agreeable.</P>
<P>At the North Ea&s;t End of this Range of &s;ine Seats, is Letherhead, a little Thorough-fare Town, with a Stone.
<PB REF="93" MS="Y">
Bridge over the River Mole; this Ri|ver is called the Mole, from its remark|able &s;inking into the Earth, at the foot of Box-Hill, near a Village call'd Mick|lehand, and working its way under Ground like a Mole, ri&s;ing again at or near this Town of Letherhead, where wandering, its Streams are united again, and f$$m a pretty large River, as they were before, running together under Leatherhead Bridge, and from thence to Cobham, and &s;o i$ pur&s;ues its Cour&s;e to the Thames, which it joins at Mole&s;y, which takes its Name to be &s;ure from the Name of the River Mole.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but ta$e notice of an unaccountable Error, which all the Writers I have met with fall un|warily into, on account of this little Ri|ver hiding it&s;elf in the Earth, and find+ing its way under Ground, from the Foot of Beechwood&punc; more properly Bet&s;worth Ca&s;tle, near Box Hill, and then ri&s;ing again at Letherhead, as above, as if the Water had at once ingulph d i$&s;elf in a Cha&s;m of the Earth, or &s;$$k in a Whirl|$it, as is &s;aid of the Ca&s;pian Sea which they &s;ay ri&s;es again in the Per&s;ian Gulph with the &s;ame Violence that it ingulphs $&s;elf.

The Right Reverend and Learned Editor of the Additions to Mr. Camden, makes it yet wor&s;e, &s;peaking of Beechworth Ca&s;tle, which is a Mile before we come to Darking; and 'tis at the Foot of this Ca&s;tle here, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, that the River Mole being nigh to the c$ipi$s of Box Hill is &s;wallow'd up.</Q></P>
<P>Now 'tis &s;omething &s;trange for me to take upon me, after two &s;uch Authori|ties, to &s;ay, that neither of the&s;e is righ$ The Accounts are &s;o $word$, that ma|ny curious People have $id $word$ to $$e this Place, called Swallow, and to &s;$e this Beechworth Ca&s;tle&punc; at the Foot of which the River is &s;wallowed up, not doubting but they &s;hould &s;ee &s;ome won|derful Gulph, in which a whole Ri|ver &s;hould be at once, as it were b$|ried alive; for Mr. Camden $word$, Swal|low is the Place: The Bi&s;hop $word$ $word$ Beechworth-Ca&s;tle the River $word$ $w$l$ow|ed up; nay&punc; and to make the W$$der appear more conformable to the Rela|ti$n, the Map of the County of S$$rey, placed in Mr. Camden, makes a large Blank between the River at Swallowed up, a little off of Darking, and i$s $word$ again as at $span$, breaking the River off abruptly, $s if pouring its Wa|ters all at once into a $span$ of the Common-Shores of the Streets of London, and $word$ it out a$ in at once, ju&s;t as the Water of the $word$ running into Fl$et $word$ $word$ out from under $word$ $word$.</P>

and runs cro&s;s the Road which leads from Darking to Leatherhead, where it is ap|parently rapid and &s;trong; and then fetches a Circuit round a Park, formerly belonging to Sir Richard Studdolph, and which is part of it, within &s;ight of Lea|therhead, and &s;o keeps a continued Cha|nel to the very Town of Leatherhead; &s;o that there is no &s;uch thing as a na|tural Bridge, or a River lo&s;t, no, not at all; and in the Winter, in time of Floods the Stream will be very large, and rapid all the way above Ground, which I af|firm of my own Knowledge, having &s;een it &s;o, on many Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But the true State of the Ca&s;e is this, the Current of the River being much ob&s;tructed by the Interpo&s;ition of tho&s;e Hills, called Box-Hill, which though de|&s;cending in a kind of Vale, as if parted to admit the River to pa&s;s, and making that De&s;cent &s;o low as to have the ap|pearance of a Level, near a Village call|ed Mickleham; I &s;ay, the&s;e Hills yet in|terrupting the free Cour&s;e of the River, it forces the Waters as it were to find their Way through as well as they can; and in order to this, beginning, I &s;ay, where the River comes clo&s;e to the Foot of the Precipice of Box-Hill, called the Stomacher, the Waters &s;ink in&s;en&s;ibly away, and in &s;ome Places are to be &s;een (and I have &s;een them) little Chanels which go out of the &s;ides of the River, where the Water in a Stream not &s;o big as would fill a Pipe of a quarter of an Inch Diameter, trills away out of the River, and &s;inks in&s;en&s;ibly into the Ground.</P>
<P>In this manner it goes away, le&s;&s;ening the Stream for above a Mile, near two, and the&s;e they call the Swallows; and the whole Ground on the Bank of the River, where it is flat and low, is full of the&s;e &s;ubterraneous Pa&s;&s;ages; &s;o that if on any &s;uden rain the River &s;wells over Banks, it is ob&s;erv'd not to go back into the Chanel again when the Flood abates, but to &s;ink away into the Earth in the Meadows, where it &s;preads; a remark|able Proof of which I &s;hall give pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>But now take this with you as you go, that the&s;e Swallows, for they are many, and not one call'd the Swallow, as is &s;aid in Mr. Camden; the&s;e Swal|lows (I &s;ay) tho' they dimini&s;h the Stream much, do not &s;o drink it up as to make it di&s;appear. But that, where it cro&s;&s;es the Road near Mickleham, it runs, as I have &s;aid, very &s;harp and broad, nor did I ever know it dry in the drye&s;t Summer in that Place, tho' I liv'd in $he Neighbourhood &s;everal Years: On the contrary I have known it &s;o deep, that Waggons and Carriages have not dar'd to go $hro'&punc; but never knew it, I &s;ay, dry in the greate&s;t time of Drought.</P>
<P>Below this Place the Hills ri&s;e again on the other &s;ide very high, and parti|cularly on the Ridge, which the Coun|try People call the A&s;hcom-Hills, and they &s;eem to force the River again We&s;t; &s;o it &s;urrounds mo&s;t of the Park I menti|oned above, and has &s;everal Bridges up|on it, and by this time indeed, &s;o much of it is &s;un away&punc; that in a very dry Summer the Chanel, tho' full of Water in Pits and Holes cannot be perceiv'd to run, but this mu&s;t be, I &s;ay, in a very dry Sea&s;on, and &s;till there is the Chanel vi&s;ible where it runs at other times fiercely enough.</P>
<P>This part which I &s;ay has the lea&s;t Water, continuing about half a Mile, we then perceive the Chanel in&s;en&s;ibly to have more Water than before: That is to &s;ay, that as it &s;unk in gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly, &s;o it takes vent again in the like manner in Thou&s;ands of little Springs and un&s;een Places, very few in any quan+tity, till in another half Mile, it is a ful River again, and pa&s;&s;es in full Stream under Leatherhead Bridge, above, an$ for the truth of this, I apeal to the Know+ledge of the Inhabitants of Darking Mickleham, Leatherhead, and all th$ Country round.</P>
<P>A farther Proof of this, and which $word$ the Account which I promi&s;ed abov$ relating to the gradual &s;inking away $word$ the Water, take as follows: It was $word$

the Year 1676, in the Month of Octo|ber, or thereabouts, that there happen d a very &s;udden ha&s;ty Land Flood, which &s;welled the River to a very great height; and particularly &s;o high, that at Beech|worth-Ca&s;tle, and other Gentlemen's Seats near the River, where they had Fi&s;h-Ponds that were fed by the River, i$ overflowed their Ponds, and carry'd o$f all their Fi&s;h, or at lea&s;t they thought for Sir Adam Brown lived then at Beech|worth-Ca&s;tle, a Gentleman in tho&s;e days well known in the Country, for he was many Years Knight of the Shire, of the F$$$ly of Brown, a Branch of the $ou$e of Montacute's at Midhur&s;t, mentioned before, but a Collateral Line; another of the Brown's lived at Bueknal, another at Darking, &s;hhich I mention chiefly, becau&s;e &s;ome ignorant Wri$ers particu|larly the late Atlas, has confounded the Title of Montacute with the Sirname of Montague, which is quite another Fa|mily and Generation, not at all ally'd, and nothing near &s;o Ancient; but this by the by.</P>
<P>Sir Adam Brown's Son, and the young Gentlemen of the&s;e and other neigbour|ing Families, di&s;turbed at the lo&s;s of their Fi&s;h and moved by the Report, came all down to Darking, where they rai&s;ed a little Troop of the young Fellows and Boys of the Town, and all went toge|ther, to that part of the River which runs by the Foot of the Stomacher, as I &s;aid they call it, Box-Hill.</P>
<P>There was a low flat piece of Mea|dow Ground, l$ing clo&s;e to the River on one &s;ide&punc; ju&s;t oppo&s;i$e to which, the Hill lying al&s;o clo&s;e to the River, made up the Bank on the other: This piece of Ground might contain about four or five Acres, and lying hollow in the middle, like the &s;hape of a Dripping-Pan, was, by the overflowing of the River, full of Water, and &s;o full, that the Bank, which lay clo&s;e to the River, though higher than the re&s;t, was not to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen &s;et them&s;el$es and all their little Army at work, to r$i&s;e this Bank which. I &s;ay, lay between the Ri+ver and the hollow of the Field, &s;o as to &s;eparate the Water in the hollow part of the Field from that in the River, and having &s;o many Hands, they effected that Part the fir&s;t Day, and made a &s;o|lid Dam, or Bank, &s;o that they could walk upon it dry &s;ooted; then they made a return to it, at the upper or Ea&s;t End of the Field; &s;o that in &s;hort, no more Water could run into $he Field from any part of the River.</P>
<P>When this was done, they built Huts, o$ Boots, and made Fires, and &s;ent for Victuals and Drink to treat their young Company, and there they encamped as if they waited &s;ome great Event; and &s;o indeed the$ did, for in about two Nights and a Day, exclu&s;ive of the time they took in making their Dams, the Water &s;unk all away in the Field; and the Con|&s;equence of that was, that the Fi&s;h be|ing &s;urrounded, were catched, as it were in a Trap, for they could not be &s;wal|&s;owed up with the Water; and the Pur|cha&s;e fully recompenced their Labour, for the like Quantity of Fi&s;h; great and &s;mall, I believe, was never taken at once in this Kingdom, out of &s;o &s;mall a Ri|ver.</P>
<P>This Story would have nothing in it wonder&s;ul, or to make it worth accor|ding, were it not &s;o evident a Demon|&s;tration of the manner of this River lo&s;ing it&s;elf under Ground, or being &s;wallowed up, as they call it; for this Field where the Water funk away is ju&s;t at the Place, which Mr. Cambden calls the Swallows, n$ar the Village of Mic&s;$leham; and under the Precipiece of the Hill, and yet the Water was two Nights and a Day, as I &s;ay, &s;inking lei|&s;urely off; and in this manner, and in no other, does the whole River, or &s;o much of it as pa&s;&s;es under Ground, &s;ink away.</P>
<P>The Town of Darking is eminent for &s;everol little Things worth Ob&s;erva|tion; as fir&s;t, for the great Roman High|way, call'd S$onny &s;treet, which Mr. Camden &s;ays, pa&s;&s;es through the very Church-Yard of his Town. Secondly

for a little Common or Heath, call'd the Cottman Dean, or the Dean or Heath of Poor Cottagers, for &s;o the Word &s;ig|nifies, belonging to the Town; and where their Alms-Hou&s;e &s;tands; which &s;ome learned Phy&s;icians have &s;ingled out for the be&s;t Air in England: Thirdly, for Mr. Howard's Hou&s;e and Garden, call d Deaden, the Garden is &s;o naturally mounded with Hills, that it makes a com|pleat Amphitheatre, being an Oblong Square, the Area about Eighty Yards by Forty, and the Hills unpa&s;&s;able &s;teep, &s;erve in&s;tead of Walls, and are hand|&s;omely planted with Trees, who&s;e Tops ri&s;ing above one another gradually, as the Hill ri&s;es at their Roots, make a mo&s;t beautiful Green Wall, of perhaps Fifty or Sixty Foot high; at the North End, which is the Entrance, is the Hou&s;e, which clo&s;es it wholly, and at the South End, the ancient Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;er, Mr. Howard, by what we call Perforation, cau&s;ed a Vault or Cave to be made quite through the Hill, which came out again into a fine Vineyard, which he planted the &s;ame Year, on the South &s;ide, or &s;lope of the Hill, and which they &s;ay has produced &s;ince mo&s;t excellent good Wines, and a very great quantity of them.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard was an Honourable and Ancient Gentleman, younger Brother to the Duke of Norfolk, then living; viz. In the Year 1676, for in that Year, or the Year before, was that Vineyard plant|ed, and tho' Mr. Howard was then upwards of Sixty Years of Age, he en|joy'd that plea&s;ant Seat near Thirty Years after.</P>
<P>At this Town liv'd another ancient Gentleman and his Son, of a very good Family; viz. Augu&s;tin Bell&s;on, E&s;q; or as &s;ome write it Bel&s;chon, the Father was mea&s;ur'd &s;even Foot and half an Inch high, allowing all that he might have &s;unk, for his Age, being Seventy One Years old; and the Son mea&s;ur'd Two Inches Taller than his Father.</P>
<P>The&s;e Families were Roman, as were &s;everal others thereabouts at that time; but were &s;oon after, upon the breaking out of the Popi&s;h Plot, di&s;pers'd&punc; &s;ome one way, and &s;ome another, as the Fate of tho&s;e Times oblig'd them to do: tho' I do not remember that any part of the Scenes of Trea&s;on were lay'd about Darking, or that any of the Romi&s;h Gen|tlemen thereabout were charg'd with be|ing concern'd with them.</P>
<P>The Market of Darking cannot be o|mitted, as it relates to my de&s;ign of giving an Account of the &s;everal Parts of England; from whence this great City of London, and all the Dai$ty Di&s;hes, which are to be &s;een there, as to Eating, is &s;upply'd with Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>This Market is of all the Markets in England famous for Poultry; and par|ticularly for the fa&s;te&s;t Gee&s;e, and the large&s;t Capons, the Name of a Darking Capon being well known among the Poulterers in Leadenhall Market&punc; in a Word, they are brought to this Market from as far as Hor&s;ham in Su&s;&s;ex; and 'tis the Bu&s;ine&s;s of all the Country, on that &s;ide for many Miles, to breed and fatten up, in&s;omuch, that 'tis like a Ma|nufacture to the Country People; and &s;ome of the&s;e Capons are &s;o large, as that they are little inferior to Turkeys: and I have &s;een them &s;old for 4 s. to $ s. 6d. each and weighing from 4 $ to 5 or 6$. a piece.</P>
<P>Once a Year here is al&s;o a Fair, viz. on Holy Thur&s;day, chiefly for Lambs, and the greate&s;t F ir in England of that kind: I have pa&s;s'd over the &s;o much celebrated Hou&s;e of Mr. Fvelyn at Wo$|ton near Darking&punc; not that it is not wor$h Notice, but becau&s;e &s;o many other Wri|ters have &s;aid &s;o much of it.</P>
<P>On the Top of Box-Hill, and in view of this Town, grows a very great Beech-Tree, which by way of di&s;tinction is call'd The great Beech, and a very great Tree it is; but I mention it on the following account, under the Shade of this Tree, was a little Vaul$ or Ca$e, and here every Sunday, during the Summer Sea&s;on, there u&s;ed to be a Ren|dezvous of Coaches and Hor&s;emen with abundance of Gentlemen and Ladies from Ep&s;om to take the Air, and in the Bo$-Woods; and in a word, Divert, or De|bauch,

or perhaps both, as they thought fit, and the Game encrea&s;ed &s;o much, that it began almo&s;t on a &s;udden to make a great Noi&s;e in the Country.</P>
<P>A Vintner who kept the King's-Arms-Inn, at Darking&punc; taking Notice of the con&s;tant and unu&s;ual Flux of Company thither, took the Hint from the Pro&s;pect of his Advantage, which offered, and obtaining leave of Sir Adam Brown, who&s;e Mannor and Land it was f$$|ni&s;h'd this little Cellar or Vault with Tables, Chairs, &amp;c. and with Wine and Eatables to entertain the Ladies and Gentlemen on Sundays Nights, as above; and this was &s;o agreeable to them as that it encrea&s;ed the Company exceed|ingly; in a Word, by the&s;e means, the Concour&s;e of Gentry, and in con&s;equence of the Country People, became &s;o great, that the Place was a little Fair; &s;o that at length the Country began to take Notice of it, and it was very offen&s;ive, e&s;pecially to the be&s;t governed People; this la&s;ted &s;ome Years, I think Two or Three, and tho' Complaint was made of it to Sir Adam Brown, and the Neigh|bouring Ju&s;tices; alledging the Revell|ing, and the indecent Mirth that was among them, and on the Sabbath Day too, yet it did not obtain a &s;uitable Re+dre&s;s; whereupon a certain &s;et of young Men, of the Town of Darking, and perhaps prompted by &s;ome others, re|&s;enting the Thing al&s;o&punc; made an unwel|come Vi&s;it to the Place once on a Sa|turday Night, ju&s;t before the u&s;ual Time of their wicked Mirth, and behold when $he Coaches and Ladies, &amp;c. from Ep|$om appear'd the next Afternoon, they $ound the Cellar or Vault, and all that was in it, blown up with Gun-Powder; $nd &s;o &s;ecret was it kept, that upon the $tmo&s;t enquiry it cou'd never be heard, $r found out who were the Per&s;ons that $id it: That Action put an End to their $evels for a great while; nor was the $lace ever repair'd that I heard of, at $a&s;t it was not put to the &s;ame wicked $&s;e that it was employ'd in before.</P>
<P>From this Hill, and particularly from his part of it, is a fair View in clear Weather quite over the Wild of Su&s;&s;ex, to the South Downs; and by the help of Gla&s;&s;es, tho&s;e who know where Things are &s;ituated, may plainly &s;ee the Town of Hor&s;ham, A&s;hdown Fore&s;t, the Duke of Somer&s;et's Hou&s;e at Petworth, and the South Downs, as they range be|tween Brighthelm&s;ton and Arundel; be|&s;ides an unbounded Pro&s;pect into Kent.</P>
<P>The Vale beneath this Hill is for many Miles Ea&s;t and We&s;t, call'd the Holmwa$d, by &s;ome the Holm-Wood, others Holm&s;dale&punc; but more vulgarly the Homeward: In the Woody Part of which are often found outlying red Deer, and in the Davs of K. James I$. or while he was Duke of York, they have hunted the large&s;t Stags here that have been &s;een in England; the Duke took great Care to have them pre&s;erv'd for his own Sport, and they were &s;o pre&s;erv'd for many Years; but have &s;ince that been mo&s;t of them de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>This Homeward, or Holmwood, is a Vale, which is now chiefly grown with Furz, famous for the Country People, gathering &s;uch quantities of Strawberries, as they car y them to Market by Hor&s;e-Loads: I &s;aw neither Town or Village, for many Miles on it, much le&s;s any Gen|tlemen's Seats, only Cottages and &s;ingle Hou&s;es; but va&s;t quantities of Gee&s;e and Poultry, which as &s;aid above employs all the Country in breeding them up: There has been large Timber here, (they &s;ay) but mo&s;t of it is cut down and gone, except that where there are any Woods &s;tanding, the Timber is &s;till exceeding good and large.</P>
<P>It is &s;ugge&s;ted that this Place was in ancient Times &s;o unpa&s;&s;able a Wild, or overgrown Wa&s;te, the Woods &s;o thick, and the extent &s;o large, reaching far into Su&s;&s;ex, that it was the Retreat for many Ages of the Native Britons, who the Romans cou'd never drive out; and after that it was the like to the Saxons, when the Danes harra&s;s'd the Nation with their Troops, and Ravag'd the Country wherever they came; and on this Account they retain here in Me|mory the following Lines.</P>

<P>Keeping at the Bottom of the&s;e Hills, and yet not entered into this Vale, the Country is dry, and rather &s;andy or gra|vel, and is full of Gentlemen's Hou&s;es, and of good Towns, but if we go but a little to the Right Hand South into the &s;aid wild Part, 'tis a deep, &s;trong, and in the wet Sea&s;on, an unpa&s;&s;able Clay.</P>
<P>Here travelling Ea&s;t at the Foot of the Hills, we came to Rygate, a large Market-Town with a Ca&s;tle, ann a Man|&s;ion-Hou&s;e, inhabited for &s;ome Years by Sir John Par&s;ons, once Lord Mayor of London, and who&s;e Son, an Alderman, has likewi&s;e &s;ucceeded to that high Po&s;t.</P>
<P>Here are two mi&s;erable Borough Towns too, which neverthele&s;s &s;end each of them two Members to Parliament, to wit, Gatton under the &s;ide of the Hill, almo&s;t at Rygate; and Bleechingly, more Ea&s;tward on the &s;ame Cro&s;s-Road, which we were upon before: In the fir&s;t of there Sir John Thom&s;on, (afterwards Lord Haver&s;ham) having purcha&s;ed the Mannor, was always elected; as Mr. Paul Docminique, an Italian Merchant, has been &s;ince: The la&s;t was for many Years, the E&s;tate of Sir Robert Claytou, a known Citizen, and Benefactor to the City of London, who&s;e Po&s;terity &s;till enjoy it: And at either Town the Pur|cha&s;ers &s;eem to buy the Election with the Property</P>

<P>From hence, cro&s;&s;ing &s;till all the Roads leading from London into Su&s;&s;ex, we come to a Village called God&s;tone, which lies on the Road from London to Lewis; and keeping on Ea&s;t we come to We&s;|terham, the fir&s;t Market Town in Rent on that &s;ide: This is a neat hand&s;ome well built Market Town, and is full of Gentry, and con&s;equently of good Com|pany. The late Ea$l of Jer&s;ey built, or rather fini$$ed, for it was begun by a private Gentleman, a ve y $oble Hou&s;e here, which &s;till remains in the Fam$ly, and is every Year made finer and finer.</P>

a very hone&s;t Gentleman, if Fame lies not, was &s;o addicted to Gaming, and &s;o unfortunately over-match'd in his Play, that he lo&s;t this noble Seat and Parks, and all the fine Addenda which were then about it, at one Night's Play, &s;ome &s;ay, at one ca&s;t of Dice, to Mr. Harvey of Comb, near King&s;ton: What Mi&s;ery had befallen the Family, if the Right of the Winner had been pro&s;ecuted with Rigour, as by what I have heard it would have been, is hard to Write: But God had better Things in &s;tore for the Gentleman's Po&s;terity than he took thought for him&s;elf; and the E&s;tate being Entail'd upon the Heir, the Lo&s;er dy'd before it came into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Winner, and &s;o it has been pre&s;erv'd, and the pre&s;ent Gentleman has not reco|ver'd the Di&s;a&s;ter, but as above, has ex|ceedingly improv'd it all.</P>
<P>From hence it is but a little Mile to Ca&s;halton, a Country Village &s;ituate among innumerable Springs of Water, which all together, form a River in the very Street of the Town, and join|ing the other Springs which $word$ from Croyden and Bedington, $span$ Stream which are called the River Wandell. This Village &s;eated among &s;uch delight|ful Springs, is yet all &s;tanding upon firm Chalk; and having the Downs clo&s;e ad|joining, makes the mo&s;t agreeable Spot on all this &s;ide of London, as is abun|dantly te&s;tify'd by it&punc; being, as it were, crowded with fine Hou&s;es of the Citizens of London; &s;ome of which are built with &s;uch a Profu&s;ion of Expence, that they look rather like Seats of the Nobility, than the Country Hou&s;es of Citizens and Merchants; particularly tho&s;e of Sir William Sca$en, lately decea&s;ed; who be&s;ides an immen&s;e E&s;tate in Money has left, as I was told, one Article of Nine Thou&s;and Pounds a Year to his Heir; and was him&s;elf &s;ince the Fire of London, only Mr. Seawen, a Ham|borough Merchant, dealing by Com|mi&s;&s;ion, and not in any view of &s;uch an en$$ea&s;e of Wealth, or any thing like it.</P>
<P>The other Hou&s;e is that of Sir John Fellows, late Sub-Governor of the South-Sea Company, who having the Misfor|tune to fall in the general Calamity of the late Directors, lo&s;t all his unhappy Wealth, which he had gain'd in the Company, and a good and hone&s;tly got|ten E&s;tate of his own into the Bargain: I cannot dwell on the De&s;cription of all the fine Hou&s;es in this and the neigh|bouring Villages; I &s;hall &s;peak of them again in bulk with their Neighbours, of Mitcham, Stretham, Tooting, Claph$m, and others; but I mu&s;t take a Trip here cro&s;s the Downs to Ep$om.</P>
<P>Ban&s;tead Downs needs no De&s;cription other than this, that their being &s;o near London, and &s;urrounded as they are with plea&s;ant Villages, and being in them&s;elves perfectly agreeable, the Ground &s;mooth, &s;oft, level and d y; (even in but a few Hou$s $word$ Rai$) they con&s;pire o make the m &s;t delightful Spot of G$ound, of that kind in all this Part of Britain.</P>
<P>When on the Publick Race Days they are cover'd with Coaches and Ladies, and an innumerable Company of Hor&s;e|men, as well Gentlemen as Citizens, at|tending the Sport; and then adding to the Beauty of the Sight, the Racers fly|ing over the Cour&s;e, as if they either touch'd not, or felt not the Ground they run upon; I think $o Sight, except that of a Victorious Army, under the Com|mand of a Prote&s;tant King of Great Bri|tain could exceed it.</P>
<P>About four Miles, over th$&s;e delicious Downs, brings us to Ep&s;om, and if you will &s;uppo&s;e me to come the e in the Month of July, or thereabouts $word$ may think me to come in the middle of the Sea&s;on, when the Town is full of Com|pany, and all di&s;po&s;ed to Mirth and Plea|&s;antry; for abating one u$h$ppy Sto$k Jobbing Year, when England took leave to act the Frantick, for a little while; and when every Body's Heads we e turn'd with Projects and S o$ks, I &s;ay, except this Year, we &s;ee nothing of Bu&s;ine&s;s in the whole Conver&s;ation of Ep$om; even the Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, who are really &s;o when in London; whether
<PB REF="101" MS="Y">
it be at the Exchange, the Alley, or the Trea&s;ury Office, and the Court, yet here they look as if they had left all their London Thoughts behind them, and had &s;eparated them&s;elves to Mirth and good Company; as if they came hither to un|bend the Bow of the Mind, and to give them&s;elves a loo&s;e to their innocent Plea|&s;ures; I &s;ay, innocent, for &s;uch they may enjoy here and &s;uch any Man may make his being here, if he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>As, I &s;ay&punc; this Place &s;eems adapted wholly to Plea&s;ure, &s;o the Town is &s;uited to it; tis all Rural, the Hou&s;es are built at large, not many together, with Gar|dens and Ground about them; that the People who come out of their confin'd Dwellings in London, may have Air and Liberty, &s;uited to the De&s;ign of Country Lodgings.</P>
<P>You have no &s;ooner taken Lodgings, and $n$e$'d the Apartments, but if you are $word$ thing known, youwalk out, to &s;eewho and who's together; for 'tis the general Language of the Place, Come let's go &s;ee the Town, Folks don't come to Ep&s;om to &s;tay within Doors.</P>
<P>The next Morning you are welcom'd with the Mu&s;ick under your Chamber Window; but for a Shilling or Two you get rid of them, and prepare for going to the Wells.</P>
<P>Here you have the Compliment of the Place, are enter'd into the Li&s;t of the plea&s;ant Company, &s;o you become a Ci|tizen of Ep&s;om for that Summer; and this co&s;ts you another Shilling, or if you plea&s;e, Half a Crown: Then Drink the Waters, or walk about as if you did; Dance with the Ladies, tho' it be in your Gown and Slippers, have Mu&s;iek and Company of what kind you like, for every Man may &s;ort him&s;elf as he plea&s;es; the grave with the grave, and the gay with the gay, the bright, and the wicked; all may be match'd if they &s;eek for it, and perhaps &s;ome of the la&s;t may be over-match'd, if they are not upon their Guard.</P>
<P>After the Morning Diver&s;ions are over, and every one are walk'd home to their Lodgings, the Town is perfectly quiet again; nothing is to be &s;een, the Green, the great Room, the Raffling-Shops all are (as if it was a Trading Town on a Holiday) &s;hut up; there's little &s;tirring, except Footmen, and Maid Servants, go to and fro of Errands, and Higlers and Butchers, carrying Provi&s;ions to People's Lodgings.</P>
<P>This takes up the Town till Dinner is over, and the Company have repos'd for two or three Hours in the heat of the Day; then the fir&s;t thing you ob&s;erve is, that the Ladies come to the &s;hady Seats, at their Doors, and to the Benches in the Groves, and cover'd Walks; (of which, every Hou&s;e that can have them, is generally &s;upply'd with &s;everal.) Here they refre&s;h with cooling Liquors, a|greeable Conver&s;ation, and innocent Mirth.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that have Coaches, or Hor&s;es (as &s;oon as the Sun declines) take the Air on the Downs, and tho&s;e that have not, content them&s;elves with &s;taying a little later, and when the Air grows cool, and the Sun low, they walk out under the Slaer, of the Hedges and Trees, as they find it for their Diver&s;ion: In the mean time, towards Evening the Bowl|ing Green begins to fill, the Mu&s;ick &s;trikes up in the great Room, and Com|pany draws together a pace: And here they never fail of abundance of Mirth, every Night being a kind of Ball; the Gentlemen Bowl, the Ladies Dance, others Raffle, and &s;ome Rattle; Conver|&s;ation is the general Plea&s;ure of the Place, till it grows late, and then the Company draws off, and generally &s;peaking, they are pretty well as to keeping good Hours; &s;o that by Eleven a Clock the Dancing generally ends, and the Day clo&s;es with good wi&s;hes, and appoint|ments to meet the next Morning at the Wells, or &s;omewhere el&s;e.</P>
<P>The retir'd part of the World, of which al&s;o there are very many here, have the Waters brought home to their Apart|ments in the Morning where they Drink and Walk about a little, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Phy&s;ical Operation, till near Noon, then dre&s;s Dinner, and repo&s;e for the Heat as
<PB REF="102" MS="Y">
others do; after which they Vi&s;it, drink Tea, walk Abroad, come to their Lodg|ings to Supper, then walk again till it grows dark, and then to Bed: The greate&s;t part of the Men, I mean of this Grave &s;ort, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, who are at London up|on Bu&s;ine&s;s all the Day, and thronging to their Lodgings at Night, make the Families, generally &s;peaking, rather pro|vide Suppers than Dinners for 'tis very frequent for the Trading part of the Company to place their Families here, and take their Hor&s;es every Morning to London, to the Exchange, to the Alley, or to the Ware hou&s;e, and be at Ep&s;ome again at Night; and I know one Citizen that practis'd it for &s;everal Years toge|ther, and &s;carce ever lay a Night in London during the whole Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, makes the good Wives &s;atisfy them&s;elves with providing for the Family, rather at Night than at Noon, that their Husbands may eat with them; after which they walk Abroad as above, and the&s;e they call the &s;ober Citizens, and tho&s;e are not much at the $$lls, or at the Green; except &s;ometimes, when they give them&s;elves a Holiday, or when they get &s;ooner home than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e which I call the more retir'd part the Company, the lea&s;t part of tho&s;e that fill up the Town of Ep&s;om, nor is their way of living &s;o retir'd, but that there is a great deal of Society, Mirth, and good Manners, and good Company among the&s;e too.</P>
<P>The fine Park of the late Earl of Berke|ley, near Ep&s;om, was formerly a great addition of the plea&s;ure of the Place, by the fine Walks and cool Retreats there; but the Earl finding it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for a known Rea&s;on, to &s;hut it up, and not permit any walking there, that Relief to the Company was abated $$r &s;ome Years; but the Plea&s;ures of Na|ture are &s;o many round the Town, the &s;hady Frees &s;o every where planted, and now generally well grown, that it makes Ep&s;om like a great Park fill'd with lit|tle Groves, Lodges and Retrears for $ool $word$ of Air, and Shade from $word$ Sun; and I believe, I may &s;ay, it is not to be match'd in the World, on that account; at lea&s;t, not in &s;o little a &s;pace of Ground.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd too, that for &s;hady Walks, and innumerable Numbers of Trees planted before the Hou&s;es, Ep&s;om differs much from it &s;elf, that is to &s;ay, as it was twenty or thirty Years ago, for then tho&s;e Trees that were planted, were generally young, and not grown; a d now not only all the Trees then young, are grown large a d fair, but Thou&s;ands are planted &s;ince; &s;o that the Town, an and &s;tance, loo s like a great Wood full of Hou&s;es, &s;catter'd every where, all over it.</P>
<P>In the Winter this is no Place for Plea|&s;ure indeed; as it is full of Mirth and Caiery in the Summer, &s;o the Pro&s;pect in the Winter, pre&s;eurs you with little, but good Hou&s;es &s;hut up, and Windows fa&s;ten'd; the Furniture taken down, the Families remov'd, the Walks out of Re|pair, the Leaves off of the Trees, and the People out of the Town; and which is &s;till wor&s;e, the ordinary Ronds both to it, and near it, except only on the the &s;ide of the Downs, are deep, &s;tiff, full of Sloughs, and, in a Word, unpa&s;|&s;able; for all the Country the &s;ide of the Downs, as I have &s;aid, only excepted, is a deep &s;tiff Clay; &s;o that there's to riding in the Winter with$u$ $he $$mo&s;t Fatigue, and &s;ome hazard, and this is the Rea&s;on that Ep&s;om is not ($word$ Hamp|&s;tead or Richmond) fu$l of Company in Winter as well as Summer.</P>
<P>From Ep&s;om that I might tho oughly vi&s;it the County of Surrey, I rode over tho&s;e Clays, and through very bad Roads to King&s;ton and from thence keeping the Bank of the River on my $i$$|hand, I had a fine view of Ham$$o$ Court, at a di&s;tance, but had re&s;erv'd it for another Journey; and was bound now in &s;earch of a piece of Aeriquity &s;o &s;atisfy my own Curio&s;ity, this was to Oatl$$d, that I might &s;ee the famous Place where Julius $word$ pa&s;$'d the Ricer $word$ in the $span$ of the B$i$i&s;h Army, and no$wit$&s;tanding they had
<PB REF="103" MS="Y">
&s;tuck the River full of &s;harp Stakes for Three Miles together.</P>
<P>The People &s;aid &s;everal of tho&s;e Stakes were &s;till to be &s;een in the Bottom of the River, having &s;tood there for now above 1760 Years; but they cou'd &s;how me none of them, tho' they call the Place Coway Stakes to this Day; I cou'd make little Judgment of the thing, only from this, that it really &s;eems probable, that this was the fir&s;t Place where Cae&s;ar at that time cou'd find the River Fordable, or any way Pa&s;&s;able to him, who had no Boats, no Pontons, and no way to make Bridges over, in the Teeth of &s;o Powerful, and &s;o Furious an Enemy; but the Ro|man Valour and Di&s;cipline &s;urmounted all Difficulties, and he pa&s;$'d the Army, routing the Britons; who&s;e King and Ge|neral, Ca&s;&s;ibellanus, never offer'd a pitch'd Battle to the Romans afterward.</P>
<P>Satisty'd with what little I cou'd &s;ee here, which indeed was nothing at all, but the meer Place, &s;aid to be &s;o; and which it behov'd me to believe only be|cau&s;e it was not unlikely to be true; I &s;ay, &s;atisfy'd with this, I came back directly to King&s;tone&punc; a good Market-Town, but remarkable for little, only that they &s;ay, the Antient Briti&s;h and Saxon Kings were u&s;ually Crown'd here in former Times, which I will neither a&s;&s;ert or deny.</P>
<P>But keeping the River now on my Left, as I did before on my Right-Hand, draw|ing near to London, we came to Hame and Peter&s;on, little Villages; the fir&s;t, famous for a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Pallace of the late Duke of Lauderdale, clo&s;e by the River; a Hou&s;e King Charles II. u&s;ed to be frequently at, and be exceedingly plea&s;ed with; the Avenues of this fine Hou&s;e to the Land &s;ide, come up to the end of the Village of Peter&s;on, where he Wall of New Park comes al&s;o clo&s;e $o the Town, on the other &s;ide; in an Angle of which &s;tood a mo&s;t delicious Hou&s;e, built by the late Earl of Roche&s;|er, Lord High Trea&s;urer in King James I's Reign, as al&s;o in part of Queen Ann's $eign, which Place he di&s;charg'd &s;o well, that we never heard of any any mi&s;ap|plications, &s;o much as &s;ugge&s;ted much le&s;s inquir'd after.</P>
<P>I am oblig'd to &s;ay only, that this Hou&s;e &s;tood here; for even while this is writing the Place &s;eems to be but Smoaking with the Ruins of a mo&s;t unhappy Di&s;a&s;ter, the whole Hou&s;e being a few Months ago burnt down to the Ground with a Fire, &s;o &s;udden, and &s;o furious&punc; that the Fami|ly who were all at home, had &s;carce time to &s;ave sheir Lives.</P>
<P>Nor was the Hou&s;e, tho' &s;o exqui&s;itely fini&s;hed, &s;o Beautiful within and without, the greate&s;t Lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained; the rich Fur|niture, the curious Collection of Paint|ings; and above all, the mo&s;t curious Collection of Books, being the Library of the Fir&s;t Earl of Clarendon, Lord Chancellor of England and Author of that mo&s;t excellent Hi&s;tory of the Rebel|lion, of which the World knows &s;o much; I &s;ay this Library, as I am a&s;&s;ur'd, was here wholly con&s;um'd; a Lo&s;s irreparable, and not to be &s;ufficiently regretted by all Lovers of Learning, having among other valuable Things, &s;everal Manu&s;cripts re|lating to tho&s;e Times, and to Things tra$&s;$cted by him&s;elf, and by the King his Ma&s;ter, both at Home and Abroad; and of other Antient Things, Collected by that Noble and Learned Author in Foreign Count$ies; which both for their Variety, Antiquity, and Authority, were of an ine&s;timable Value.</P>
<P>From hence we came to Ri$hmond, the delightful Retreat of their Royal Highne&s;&s;es, the Prince and Prince&s;s of Wales, and where they have &s;pent the fine Sea&s;on every Summer for &s;ome Years; The Prince's Count being &s;o near mu&s;t needs have fill d Richmond, which was before a mo&s;t agreeable Retreat, for the Fir&s;t and Second rate Gentry, with a great deal of the be&s;t Company in Eng|land: This Town and the Country adja|cent, encrea&s;e daily in Buildings, many no|ble Hou&s;es for the Accomodation of &s;uch, being lately rais'd and more in P$o&s;pect: But 'tis fear'd &s;hould the Prince come, for any Cau&s;e that may happen, to quit that &s;ide of the Country, tho&s;e nume|rous Buildings mu&s;t abate in the Value which is now &s;et upon them: The Com|pany
<PB REF="104" MS="Y">
however, at Richmond, is very great in the Winter, when the Prince's Court is not there; becau&s;e of the Neigh|bourhood of &s;o many Gentlemen, who live con&s;tantly there, and thereabouts; and of its nearne&s;s to London al&s;o: And in this it has the advantage both of Ep|&s;ome and Tunbridge.</P>
<P>Here are Wells likewi&s;e, and a Mine|ral-Water, which tho' not &s;o much us'd as that at Ep&s;om and Tunbridge, are yet &s;ufficient to keep up the forms of the Place, and bring the Company together in the Morning, as the Mu&s;ick does in the Evening; and as there is more of Qua|lity in and about the Place than is ordina|rily to be &s;een at Ep&s;ome, the Company is more &s;hining, and &s;ometimes even Il|lu&s;triou&s;ly bright.</P>
<P>Mr. Temple created Baron Temple, of the Kingdom of Ireland, even &s;ince this Circuit was perform'd; and who is the Son and Succe&s;&s;or to the Honour, E&s;tate, and great part of the Character of the Great Sir William Temple, has a fine Seat and Gardens (hard by) at Shene; The Gardens are indeed exqui&s;itely fine, being fini&s;hed, and even contriv'd by the Great Genius of Sir William, his Father; and as they were his la&s;t Delight in Life, &s;o they were every way &s;uited to be &s;o, to a Man of Sen&s;e and Capacity, who knew what kind of Life was be&s;t fitted to make a Man's la&s;t Days happy.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the Beauty with which the Banks of the Thames &s;hine on either &s;ide of the River, from hence to London, much more than our Ance&s;tors, even of but one Age ago, knew any thing of: If for plea&s;ant Vil|lages, great Hou&s;es, Palaces, Gardens, &amp;c. it was true in Queen Elizabeth's Time, according to the Poet, that</P>
<P>The Thames with Royal Tyber may compare.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, if this were true at that time, What may be &s;aid of it now; When for one fine Hou&s;e that was to be &s;een then, there are a Hundred; nay for ought I know, Five Hundred to be &s;een now, even as you &s;it &s;till in a Boat, and pa&s;s up and down the River?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t beginning from Ham-Hou&s;e, above, the Prince's Palace &s;alutes the Eye, being formerly no more than a Lodge in the Park, and by that means belonging to the Ranger, who was then, the (&s;ince unhappy) Duke of Ormond, and who, with other Branches of a Noble E&s;tate, lo&s;t this among the re&s;t by his Precipitate Retreat from the Parliamentary Ju&s;tice: I have &s;een many of the Seats of the No|bility in France, and &s;ome larger, but none finer than this, except &s;uch as had been lay'd out at the Royal Expence.</P>
<P>From Richmond to London, the River, &s;ides are full of Villages, and tho&s;e Vil|lages &s;o full of Beautiful Buildings, Charming Gardens, and rich Habitations of Gentlemen of Quality, that nothing in the World can imitate it; no, not the Country for Twenty Miles round Paris, tho' that indeed is a kind of Prodigy.</P>
<P>To enumerate the Gentlemen's Hou&s;es in their view, would be too long for this Work to de&s;cribe them, would fill a large Folio; it &s;hall &s;uffice to ob&s;erve &s;ome|thing concerning the Original of the &s;trange Pa&s;&s;ion, for fine Gardens, which has commendably po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Engli&s;h Gentlemen of late Years, for 'tis evident it is but of late Years.</P>
<P>It is &s;ince the Revolution that our Eng|li&s;h Gentlemen, began &s;o univer&s;ally, to adorn their Gardens with tho&s;e Plants, we call Ever Greens, which leads me to a particular Ob&s;ervation that may not be improper in this Place; King William and Queen Mary introduced each of them Two Cu&s;toms, which by the People's imi|tating them became the Two Idols of the Town, and indeed of the whole King|dom; the Queen brought in (1.) the love of fine Ea&s;t-India Callicoes, &s;uch as were then call'd Mi&s;lapatan Chints, Atla&s;&s;es, and fine painted Callicoes, which after|wards de&s;cended into the Humours of the Common People &s;o much, as to make them Greivous to our Trade, and Ruin|ing to our Manufacturies and the Poor; &s;o that the Parliament were oblig'd to make Two Acts at &s;everal times to Re|&s;train, and at la&s;t Prohibit the u&s;e of them: (2.) The Queen brought in the Cu&s;tom
<PB REF="105" MS="Y">
or Humour, as I may call it, of furni&s;hing Hou&s;es with China Ware, which increa&s;ed to a &s;trange degree afterwards, piling their China upon the Tops of Cabinets, Scrutores, and every Chimney-Piece, to the tops of the Ceilings, and even &s;etting up Shelves for their China Ware, where they wanted &s;uch Places, till it became a Grievan e in the Expence of it, and even injurious to their Families and E|&s;tates.</P>
<P>The good Queen far from de&s;i$ning any injury to the Country where &s;he was &s;o entirely belov'd, little thought &s;he was in either of the&s;e laying a Foundation for &s;uch fatal exce&s;&s;es, and would no doubt have been the fir&s;t to have reform'd them had &s;he lived to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>The King on his part introdac'd (1.) the love of Gardening; and (2.) of Paint+ing: In the fir&s;t his Maje&s;ty was parti|cularly delighted with the Decocation of Ever-Greens, as the greate&s;t a$d$ ion to the Beauty of a Garden, pre&s;erving the Figure of the Place, even in the rough|e&s;t part of an inclement and tempe&s;tuous Winter.</P>
<P>Sir Stephen Fox's Gardens at I&s;tle worth, and Sir William Temple's at Ea&s;t&s;hene, mentioned above were the only two Gardens where they had entirely per&s;ued this Method at that time, and of Sir Stephen's Gardens this was to be &s;aid, that almo&s;t all his fine Ever-Greens were rai&s;ed in the places where they &s;tood; Sir Stephen taking as much delight to &s;ee them ri&s;e gradually, and form them into what they were to be, as to buy them of the Nur&s;ery Gardiners fini&s;h'd to his Hand; be&s;ides, that by this Me|thod his Greens, the fine&s;t in England, co&s;t him nothing but the Labour of his Servants, and about ten Years Patience; which if they were to have been pur|cha&s;ed, would not have co&s;t &s;o little as Ten Thou&s;and Pounds, e&s;pecially at that time. It was here that K. William was &s;o plea&s;ed, that according to his Maje&s;ty's u&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ion, when he lik'd a Place very well, he &s;tood, and looking round him from the Head of one of the Canals, Well, &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, I cou'd dwell here five Days; every thing was &s;o exqui&s;itely centriv'd, fini&s;h'd, and well kept, that the King, who was al|low'd to be the be&s;t judge of &s;uch Things then living in the World, did not &s;o much as once &s;ay, this or that thing cou'd have been better.</P>
<P>With the particular judgment of the King, all the Gentlemen in England began to fall in; and in a few Years fine Gardens, and fine Hou&s;es began to grow up in every corner; the King be|gan with the Gardens at Hampton Court and Ken&s;ington, and the Gentlemen fol|low'd every where, with &s;uch a Gu&s;t that the Alteration is indeed wonderful thro' the whole Kingdom; but no where more than in the two Counties of Mid|dle&s;ex and Surrey, as they border on the River Thames; the Beauly and Expence of which are only to be wonder'd at, not de&s;crib'd; they may indeed be gue&s;s'd at, by what is &s;een is One or Two &s;uch as the&s;e nam'd: But I think to enter into a particular of them would be an intoller|able Task, and tedious to the Reader.</P>

<P>But I find none has &s;poken of what I call the di&s;tant Glory of all the&s;e Buildings: There is a Beauty in the&s;e Things at a di&s;tance, taking them en Pa&s;&s;ans, and in Per&s;pective, which few People value, and fewer under&s;tand; and yet here they are more truly great, than in all their private Beauties what&s;oever: Here they reflect Beauty, and Magnificence upon the whole Country, and give a kind of a Character to the I&s;land of Creat Britain in general.

<P>In a Word&punc; nothing can be more beau|tiful; here is a plain and plea&s;ant Coun|try, a rich fertile Soil, c$ltivated and en|clo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t Perfect$on of Husban|dry, then be&s;pangled with Villages; tho&s;e Villages fill'd with th$&s;e Hou&s;es, and the Hou&s;es &s;urrounded with Gard ns, Walks, Vi&s;t s, Avenues, repre&s;enting all the Beau|ties of Building, and all the Plea&s;ures $f Planting: It is impo&s;&s;ible to view the&s;e Cou$tries from any ri&s;ing Ground, and not be ravi&s;h'd with the delightful Pro&s;pect: For Example, &s;uppo&s;e you take your view from the little ri&s;ing Hills about Clapham, if you look to the Ea&s;t, there you &s;ee the $le$&s;ant Villages of Peckham and Camberwell, with &s;ome of the fine&s;t Dwel|lings about London; as (1) the Lord Powis's $t Peckham: (2) a Hou&s;e built by a Merchant, one Collins, but now, &s;tand ng empty at Camberwell, but ju&s;tly call'd a Picture of a Hou&s;e, and &s;everal others. Then turning South, we &s;ee Loughborough-Hou&s;e near Kennington, Mr. Howland's, now the Dutche&s;s of Bedford's, at Stretham; Sir Rich&punc; Tem|ple's Hou&s;e near Croydon; a whole Town of fine Hou&s;es at C &s;halton; Sir Nicholas Carew's, and Sir J hn Lake's at Beding|ton; Sir Theodore Jan&s;&s;en another Sou h-Sea Forfeitnre at Wimbleton; Sir James Bateman's at Too$ing; be&s;ides an innume|rable number in Clapham it&s;elf: On the South We&s;t al&s;o you have Mr. Harvey's at Comb, formerly the Palace of a King; with all the Villages mentioned above, and the Country adjoining fill'd with the Palaces of the Briti&s;h Nobility and Gen|try already &s;poken of; looking North, behold, to crown all, a fair Pro&s;pect of the whole City of London it$elf; the mo&s;t glorious Sight without exception, that the whole World at pre&s;ent can &s;how, or perhaps ever cou'd &s;how &s;ince the &s;a$king of Rome in the European, and the burn$ the Temple of Jeru&s;alem in the A&s;ian part of the World.</P>
<P>Add to all this, that the fine Hou&s;$s a$d innumerable more, which cannot be &s;poken of here, are n$t, at lea&s;t very few of $hem, the Man&s;ion Hou&s;es of Fa nilies, the ancient Re&s;iderces of A ce&s;tors, the Cap$tal Me&s;&s;uag$s of the E&s;tates; $or have the rich Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors any La$ds to a co &s;i$erable Value about them&punc; but the&s;e are all Hou&s;es of Ret$eat, like the Ba&s;tides of M$r&s;eil es, Gentlemen's Summer Hou&s;es, or Cirizen's Country Hou&s;es; w$ither they retire from the hurries of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and from g$tting Money, to draw their Preadth in a clear A$r, and to divert them|&s;elves and Families in the hot Weather; and that they are &s;hut up, and as it were &s;trip'd of their Inhabitants in the Win|ter, who return to Smoak and Dirt, Sin and Seacoal, (as it was cour&s;l$ expre$s'd) in the bu&s;y C ty; &s;o that in &s;hort all this Variety, this Beauty, this glorious Show of Wealth and Plenty, is really a view of the Luxuriant Age which we live in, and of the overflowing Riches of the Ci|tizens, who in their Abundance make the&s;e gay Excur&s;ions, and live thus deliciou&s;ly all the Summer retiring within them&s;elves in the Winter the be$ter to lay up for the next Summer's Expence.</P>
<P>If this then is produc'd from the gay part of the Town only, What mu&s;t be the immen&s;e Wealth of the City it &s;elf where &s;uch a Produce is brought forth? where &s;uch prodigious E&s;tates are rai&s;ed in one Man's Age; in&s;tances of which we have &s;een in tho&s;e of S r Jo&s;iah Ch ld, Sir John Lethulier, Sir James Batewan, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir William Scawen, and hundreds more; who&s;e Beginnings were &s;mall, or but &s;mall compar'd, and who have exceeded even the greate&s;t Part of the Nobility of England in Wealth, at their Death, and all of their own get|ting.</P>

It is impo&s;&s;ible in one Journey to de|&s;cribe effectually this part of the County of Surrey lying from King&s;ton to Lon|don and Greenwich, where I &s;et out: That is, including the Villages of Rich|mond, Peter&s;ham, Ea&s;t&s;hene, Mortlock, Putney, Wand&s;worth, Barn-Elms, Bat|ter&s;ey, Wimbleton, Tooting, Clapham, Camberwell, Peckham and Deptford; the De&s;cription would &s;well with the Stories of Private Families, and of the Rea&s;ons of the&s;e opulent Foundations, more than with their Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>It would al&s;o take up a large Chapter in this Book, to but mention the over|throw, and Cata&s;trophe of innumerable Wealthy City Families, who after they have thought their Hou&s;es e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and $word$ built their Magnificent Country $word$ as well as others, have &s;unk un|$er the Misfortunes of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Di&s;a&s;ters of Trade, after the World has thought them pa&s;s'd all po&s;&s;ibility of Dan|ger &s;uch as Sir Jo&s;eph Hodges, Sir Ju&s;tus Beck, the Widow Cock at Camberwell, and many others; be&s;ides all the late South-Sea Directors, all which I chu&s;e to have forgotten, as no doubt they de&s;ire to be, in Recording the Wealth and Opu|lence of this Part of England, which I doubt not to convince you infinitely out does the whole World.</P>
<P>I am come now to Southwark, a Sub|urb to, rather than a Part of London; But of which this may be &s;aid with Ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>A Royal City were not London by.</P>
<P>To give you a brief De&s;cription of South-wark, it might be call'd a long Street, of about Nine Miles in length, as it is now built on Ea&s;tward; reaching from Vaux-Hall to London-Bridge, and from the Bridge to Deptford, and up to Deptford-Bridge, which parts it from Greenwich, all the way winding and turning as the River winds and turns; ex|cept only in that Part, which reaches winds more than the River does.</P>
<P>In the Center, which is oppo&s;ite to the Bridge, it is thicken'd with Buildings, and may be reckon'd near a Mile broad, (Viz) from the Bridge to the End of Kent-&s;treet and Blackman-&s;treet, and a|bout the Mint; but el&s;e the whole Build|ing is but narrow, nor indeed can it be otherwi&s;e; con&s;idering the length of it.</P>
<P>The Principal Beauty of the Burrough of Southwark, con&s;i&s;ts in the prodigious Number of its Inhabitants, Take it as it was Antiently bounded, it contain'd Nine Pari&s;hes; but as it is now extended, and, as I &s;ay, joins with Deptford, it contains Eleven large Pari&s;hes: Accord|ing to the Weekly-Bills, for the Year 17$2, the Nine Pari&s;hes only bury'd 4166, which is about one Sixth Part of the whole Body, call'd London; the Bill of Mortallity for that Year, amounting in all to 25750.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing we meet with con&s;i|derable, is at the Spring-Garden, ju&s;t at the Corner, where the Road turns away to go from Vauxs-Hall Turnpike, towards Newington, there are the Remains of the Old Lines ca&s;t up in the Times of the Rebellion, to Fortify this Side of the Town; and at that Corner was a very large Ba&s;tion, or rather a Fort, and &s;uch indeed they call it; which Commanded all the Pa&s;s on that Side, and farther on, where the Openings near St. George's-Fields are&punc; which they now call the Ducking-Pond, there was another; the Water they call the Ducking Pond, is evidently to this Day the Moat of the Fort, and the Lines are &s;o high, and &s;o undemoli&s;h'd &s;till, that a very little mat|ter would Repair and perfect them a|gain.</P>
<P>From hence they turn'd South Ea&s;t, and went to the Windmill, at the End of Blackman &s;treet, where they cro&s;s'd the Road, and going to the End of Kent-&s;treet, we &s;ee another great Ba&s;tion; and then turning S. E. $ill they come to the End of Barnaby-&s;treet, or rather beyond, among the Tanners, and there you &s;ee another Fort, &s;o plain, and &s;o undemo|li&s;h'd

the Gra&s;s growing now over the Works, that it is as plain at it was, even when it was thrown down.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o another Remain of Anti|tiquity, the Ve&s;$igies of which are ea&s;y to be traced; viz. the Place where by &s;trength of Men's Hands, they turn'd the Channel of this great River of Thames, and made a new Cour&s;e for the Wa|ters, while the great Bridge, which is now &s;tanding, was built: Here it is evident they turn'd the Waters out, viz. About a Place call'd Nine Elms, ju&s;t beyond Vaux-Hall, where now a little Brook, from the Wa&s;h-way at Kenning|ton, and which they once attempted to make Navigable, enters the Thames, from thence it cro&s;s'd the great Road, a little beyond the end of the Hou&s;es in Newington; between which and Ken|nington Common, on the left of the Road, as you go South, there is a very large Pond, or Lake of Water, part of the Channel not fill'd up to this Day; from thence it enter'd the Mar&s;hes between Rotheriff and Deptford, where &s;o many Years after there remained a Drain for the Water, upon which was a large Mill Pond and Dam, and where &s;ince was built the &s;econd great Wet Dock, &s;aid to belonging to the Duke of Bedford's E&s;tate, and call'd at fir&s;t Snell|grove's Dock, becau&s;e built by one Mr. Snellgrove, a Shipwright, who&s;e Build|ing Yards adjoin'd it. A farther De|&s;cription of Southwark, I refer till I come to London, as one general Appellation for the two Cities of London and We&s;t|min&s;ter; and all the Borough of South|wark, and all the Buildings and Villages included within the Bills of Mortality, make but one in London, in the general Appellation, of which in its Order</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY III.</HEAD>
<P>I Find &s;o much left to &s;peak of, and &s;o many Things to &s;ay in every Part of England, that my Journey cannot be barren of Intelligence, which way &s;oever I turn; no, tho' I were to oblige my&s;elf to &s;ay nothing of any Time that had been &s;poken of before.</P>
<P>I intended once to have gone due We&s;t this Journey; but then I &s;hould have been obliged to croud my Ob&s;ervations &s;o clo&s;e, to bring Hampton Court, Wind&s;or, Blenheim, Oxford, the Bath and Bri&s;tol, all into one Journey; all tho&s;e remarkable Places lying in a Line, as it were in one Point of the Company; as to have my Journey too long, or my Ob&s;ervations too light and &s;uperficial, as others have done before me.</P>
<P>This Journey will divide the weighty Task, and con&s;equently make it &s;it light|er on the Memory, be plea&s;anter to the Reader, and make my Progre&s;s the more regular. I &s;hall therefore take in Hamp|ton Court and Wind&s;or in this Journey; the fir&s;t at my &s;etting out, and the la&s;t at my return, and the re&s;t as their Situation demands.</P>
<P>As I came down from King&s;ton, in my la&s;t Journey, by the South Bank of
<PB REF="109" MS="Y">
the Thamea, on the Surrey Side of the River; &s;o I go up to Hampton-Court, now, on the North Bank, and on the Middle&s;ex Side, which I mention, be|cau&s;e as the Sides ef the Country border|ing on the River, lie parallel, &s;o the Beauty of the Country, the plea&s;ant Si|tuations, the Glory of innumerable fine Buildings, Noblemens and Gentlemens Hou&s;es, and Citizens Retreats, are &s;o equal a Match to what I had de&s;cribed on the other Side, that one knows not which to give the Pref rence to: But as I mu&s;t &s;peak of them again, when I come to write of the County of Middle&s;ex, which I have now purpo&s;ely emitted; &s;o I pa&s;s them over here, except the Pa|l ce of Hamp on only, which I mention'd in Middl$&s;ex, for the Rea&s;ons above.</P>
<P>Hampton Court lyes on the North Bank of the River Thames, about two &s;mall Miles from King&s;ton, and on the Road from Stanes to Kin&s;ton Bridge; &s;o that the Road &s;traightening the Parks a lit le, they were obliged to pa t the Parks, and le$ve the Paddock&punc; and the great Park, part on the other Side the Road; a Te&s;ti|mony of that ju&s;t Regard that the Kings of England always had, and &s;till have, to the common Good, and to the Service of the Country, that they would not in terrupt the Cour&s;e of the Road, or cau&s;e the poor People to go out of the Way of their Bu&s;ine&s;$, to or from the Markets and F irs, for any Plea&s;ure of their own what&s;oeber.</P>
<P>The Palace of Hampton-Court was fir&s;t founded, and built from the Ground, by that great State&s;man, and Favorite of King Henry VIII. Cardinal Wool&s;ey; aS$ if it be a ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation any where, as is made from the Situation of the old Ab|bies and Mona&s;tries, the Clergy were ex|cellent Judges of the Beauty and Plea&s;ant|ne&s;s of the Country, and cho&s;e always to plant in the b$&s;t; I &s;ay, if it was a ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation in any Ca&s;e, it was in this; $word$ if there be a Situation on the whole River between $tanes-Bridge and Wind&s;or-Bridge, plea&s;anter than anoth$r, it is this of Hampton; clo&s;e to the River, yet not offended by the ri&s;ing of its Waters in Floods, or S$orms, near to the Reflux of the Tides, but not quite &s;o near as to be affected with any Foulne&s;s of the Wa|ter&punc; which the flowing of the Tides ge|nerally is the Occa&s;ion of. The Gardens extend almo&s;t to the Bank of the River&punc; yet are never overflowed; nor are there any Mar&s;hes on either Side the River to make the Waters &s;tagnate, or the Air unwhole|&s;ome on that account. The River is high enough to be navigable, and low enough to be a little plea&s;antry rapid; &s;o that the Stream looks always che$rful, not &s;low and &s;leeping, like a Pond. This keeps the Waters always clear and clean, the bot|tom in View, it has ev$ry thing that can make an Inland; or, as I may call it, a Country River, plea&s;ant and agreeable.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ing you no Songs here of the River in the fir&s;t Per&s;on of a Water Nymph, a Godde&s;s (and I know not what) according to the Humour of the ancient Poets. I &s;hall talk nothing of the Marriage of old I&s;is, the Male River, with the beau iful Thame, the Female Ri|ver, a Whim&s;y as &s;imple as the Subject was empty, but I &s;hall &s;peak of the River as Occa&s;ion pre&s;ents, as it really is made glo|rious by the Splendor of its Shores, gilded with noble Palaces, &s;trong Fortifications, large Ho&s;pitals, and publick Buildings; with the greate&s;t Bridge, and the greate&s;t City in the Wo$ld, made famous by the Opulence of its Merchants, the Encrea&s;e and Exten&s;ivene&s;s of its Commerce; by invincible Navies, and by the innumerable Fleets of Ships failing upon it, to and from all Parts of the World.</P>
<P>As I meet with the River upwards in my Travels thro' the Inland Country, I &s;hall &s;peak of it, as it is the Chanel for conveying an infinite Quantity of Provi|&s;ions from remote Counties to London, and enriching all the Counties again that lye near it, by the return of Wealth and Trade from the City; and in de&s;cribing the&s;e Things I expect both to inform and divert my Readers, and &s;peak, in a more ma&s;culine Mann r, m re to the Dignity of the Subject, and al&s;o more to their
<PB REF="110" MS="Y">
Satisfacti n, than I could do any other way.</P>
<P>There is little more to be &s;aid of the Thames, relating to Hampton-Court, than that it adds, by its Neighbourhood, to the Plea&s;ure of the Situation; for as to pa&s;&s;ing by Water too and from Lon|don, though in Summer, 'tis exceeding plea&s;ant, yet the Pa&s;&s;age is a little too long to make it ea&s;y to the Ladies, e&s;pe|cially to be crowded up in the &s;mall Boats, which u&s;ually go on the Thames for Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Prince and Prince&s;s, indeed, I re|member, came once down by Water, upon the Occa&s;ion of her Royal High|ne&s;s's being great with Child, and near her Time; &s;o near, that &s;he was deli|ver'd within two or three Days after. But this Pa&s;&s;age being in the Royal Barg|es, with &s;trength of Oars, and the Day exceeding fine, the Pa&s;&s;age, I &s;ay, was made very plea&s;ant, and &s;till the more &s;o, for being &s;hort. Again, this Pa&s;&s;age is all the Way with the Stream, whereas, in the common Pa&s;&s;age, upwards, great Part of the Way is again&s;t the Stream, which is &s;low and heavy.</P>
<P>But be the going and coming how it will by Water, 'tis an exceeding plea|&s;ant Pa&s;&s;age by Land, whether we go by the Surrey &s;ide or the Middle&s;ex &s;ide of the Water, of which I &s;hall &s;ay more in its place.</P>
<P>The Situation of Hampton-Court be|ing thus mentioned, and its Founder, 'tis to be mentioned next, that it fell to the Crown in the Forfeiture of his Eminence the Cardinal, when the King &s;eiz'd his Effectts and E&s;tate, by which this and Whitehall, another Hou&s;e of his own building al&s;o, came to King Henry VIII. two Palaces fit for the Kings of England, erected by one Cardinal, are &s;tanding Monuments of the exce&s;&s;ive Pride, as well as the immen&s;e Wealth of that Prelate, who knew no Bounds of his In&s;olence and Ambition, 'till he was o|verthrown at once by the Di&s;plea&s;ure of his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Whoever knew Hampton-Court before it was begun to be Rebuilt, or altered, by the late King William, mu&s;t acknow|ledge, it was a very compleat Palace before, and fit for a King; and though it might not, according to the modern Method of Building, or of Gardening, pa&s;s for a Thing exqui&s;itely fine; yet it had this remaining to it&s;elf, and perhaps peculiar; namely, that it &s;hewed a Situ|ation exceedingly capable of Improve|ment, and of being made one of the mo&s;t delightful Palaces in Europe.</P>
<P>This her Maje&s;ty Queen Mary was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of, that while the King had ordered the pulling down the old Apart|ments, and building it up in that mo&s;t beautiful Form, which we &s;ee them now appear in, her Maje&s;ty, impatient of en|joying &s;o agreeable a Retreat, fix'd upon a building formerly made u&s;e of chiefly for landing from the River, and there|fore called the Water Galley; and here&punc; as if &s;he had benn con&s;cious that &s;he had but a few Years to enjoy it, &s;he ordered all the little neat curious Things to be done, which &s;uited her own Convenien|ces, and made it the plea&s;ante&s;t little Thing within Doors that could po&s;&s;ibly be made, tho' its Situation being &s;uch, as it could not be allowed to &s;tand after the great Building was fini&s;hed; we now &s;ee no remains of it.</P>
<P>The Queen had here her Gallery of Beauties, being the Pictures, at full Length of the principal Ladies attending her Maje&s;ty, or who were frequently i$ her Retinue; and this was the mor$ beautiful Sight, becau&s;e the Original were all in Being, and often to be com+pared with their Pictures Her Majesty had here a fine Apartment, with a S$ of Lodgings for her private Retreat on+ly, but mo&s;t exqui&s;itely furni&s;hed; parti+cularly a fine Chints Bed, then a gre$ Curio&s;ity; another of her own Wo$$ while in Holland, very Magnifice&punc; and &s;everal others; and here was all her Maje&s;ty's fine Collection of De$$ Ware&punc; which indeed was very large an
<PB REF="111" MS="Y">
fine; and here was al&s;o a va&s;t Stock of fine China Ware, the like whereof was not then to be &s;een in England; the long Gallery, as above, was fill'd with this China, and every other place, where it could be plac'd, with advantage.</P>
<P>The Queen had here al&s;o a &s;mall Bath&punc;ing-room, made very fine, &s;uited either to hot or cold Bathing, as the Sea&s;on &s;hould invite; al&s;o a Dai$y, with all its Conveniencies, in which her Maje&s;ty took great Delight: All the&s;e things were fini&s;hed with expedition, that here their Maje&s;ties might repo&s;e while they &s;aw the main Building go forward. While this was doing, the Gardens were laid out, the Plan of them devi&s;ed by the King him&s;elf; and e&s;pecially the Amendments and Alterations were made by the King, or the Queen's particular &s;pecial Com|mand, or by both; for their Maje&s;ties a|greed &s;o well in their Fancy, and had both &s;o good Judgment in the ju&s;t Pro|portion of things, which are the princi|pal Beauties of a Garden, that it may be &s;aid, they both ordered every thing that was done.</P>
<P>Here the fine Parcel of Limes, which form the Semi circle, on the South-front of the Hou&s;e, by the Iron Gates, looking into the Park, were, by the dextrous Hand of the head Gardener removed, after &s;ome of them had been almo&s;t thirty Years planted in other places, tho not far off. I know the King of France, in the Decoration of the Gardens of Ver&s;ailles, had Oaks removed, which, by their Di|men&s;ions mu&s;t have been above an hun|dred Years old, and yet were taken up with &s;o much Art, and by the Strength of &s;uch Engines, by which &s;uch a mon&s;te rous Quantity of Earth was rai&s;ed with them, that the Trees could not feel their remove; that is to &s;ay, their Growth was not at all hinder'd. This, I confe&s;s, makes the Wonder much the le&s;s in tho&s;e Trees at Hampton-Court Gardens; but the Performance was not the le&s;s diffi+cult or nice, however, in the&s;e, and they thrive perfectly well.</P>
<P>While the Gardens were thus laid out the King al&s;o directed the laying the Pipes for the Fountain and Jette d'Eau's; and particularly the Dimen&s;ions of them, and what Quantity of Water they &s;hould ca&s;t up, and encreas'd the Number of them after the fir&s;t De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Ground on the Side of the other Front, has receiv'd &s;ome Alterations &s;ince the taking down the Water Gallery; but not that Part immediately next the Lodg|ings: The Orange Trees and fine Dutch Bays, are plac'd within the Arches of the Building under the fir&s;t Floor: &s;o that the lower Part of the Hou&s;e was all one as a Green Hou&s;e for &s;ome Time: Here &s;tands advanced, on two Pede&s;tals of Stone, two Marble Va&s;es, or Flower|pots, of mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Workman&s;hip; the one done by an Engli&s;hman, and the other by a German: 'Tis hard to &s;ay which is the be&s;t Performance, tho' the doing of it was a kind of Tryal of Skill between them; but it gives us Room, without any Partiality, to &s;ay they were both Ma&s;ters of their Art.</P>
<P>The Parterre on that Side de&s;cends from the Terra&s;s Walk by Steps, and on the Left a Terra&s;s goes down to the Water-&s;ide, from which the Garden on the Ea&s;tward Front is over-looked, and gives a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The fine Scrolls and Bordure of the&s;e Gardens were at fir&s;t edged with Box; but on the Queen's di&s;liking the Smell, tho&s;e Edgings were taking up, but have &s;ince been planted again, at lea&s;t in many Places, nothing ma$ing &s;o fair and regu|lar an Edging as Box, or is &s;o &s;oon brought to its er$ection.</P>
<P>On the North Side of the Hou&s;e, where the Gardens &s;eemed to want skreening from the Weather, or the View of the Chapel, and &s;ome part of the old Building required to be covered from the Eye; the vacant Ground, which was large, is very happily ca&s;t into a Wilder|ne&s;s, with a Labyrinth, and E&s;paliers &s;o high, that they effectually take off all that part of the old Building, which would have been offen&s;ive to the Sight. This Labyrinth, and Wilderne&s;s is not only well de&s;ign'd, and compleatly fini&s;hed, but is perfectly well kept and the E&s;paliers fill'd exactly, at Bottom to the very G ound, and
<PB REF="112" MS="Y">
are led up to proportion'd Heights on the Top; &s;o that nothing of that kind can be more beautiful.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e it&s;elf is every way an&s;wer|able on the out&s;ide to the beautiful Pro&s;pect, and the two Fronts are the large&s;t, and, beyond Compari&s;on, the fine&s;t of the Kind in England: The great Stairs go up from the &s;econd Court of the Palace on the Right Hand, and lead you to the South P$o&s;pect.</P>
<P>I hinted in my la&s;t that King Wil|liam brought into England the Love of fine Paintings, as well as that of fine Gardens; and you have an Example of it in the Cartoons, as they are call'd, being five Pieces of &s;uch Paintings, as, if you will believe Men of nice Judgment and great Travelling are not to be match'd in Europe: The Stories are known, but e&s;pecially two of them, viz. that of St. Paul preaching on Mars Hill to the &s;elf-wi&s;e Athenians, and that of St. Peter pa&s;&s;ing Sentence of Death on A|nanias; I &s;ay, the&s;e two &s;trike the Mind with the utmo&s;t Surprize; the Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o drawn to the Life, A&s;toni&s;hment, Terror and Death in the Face of Ananias; Zeal and a &s;acred Fire in the Eyes of the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle; Fright and Surprize upon the Countenances of the Beholders in the Piece of Ananias; all the&s;e de|&s;cribe them&s;elves &s;o naturally, that you cannot but &s;eem to di&s;cover &s;omething of the like Pa&s;&s;ions, even in &s;eeing them.</P>
<P>In the other, there is the Boldne&s;s and Courage with which St. Paul under|took to talk to a &s;ett of Men, who he knew de&s;pis'd all the World, as think-them&s;elves able to teach them any thing: In the Audience, there is anticipating Pride and Conceit in &s;ome, a Smile or Fleer of Contempt in others, but a kind of &s;en&s;ible Conviction, tho' cru&s;h&punc;d in its beginning, on the Faces of the re&s;t; and all together appear con&s;ounded, but have little to &s;ay, and know nothing at all of it, they gravely put him off to hear here him another Time; all the&s;e are &s;een in the very Dre&s;s of the Face; that is, $span$ Countenances which they hold while they li&s;ten to the new Doctrine which the Apo&s;tle preached to a People at that Time ignorant of it.</P>
<P>The other of the Cartoons are exceed|ing fine; but I mention the&s;e as the par|ticular two which are mo&s;t lively, which &s;trike the Fancy the &s;oone&s;t at fir&s;t view 'Tis reported, but with what Truth, know not, that the late French King of fer'd an hundred thou&s;and Louis d'On for the&s;e Pictures; but this, I &s;ay, is but a Report: The King brought a great many other fine Pieces to England, and with them the Love of fine Painting &s;o univer&s;ally &s;pread it&s;elf among the Nobi|lity and Per&s;ons of Figure all over the Kingdom, that it is incredible what Col|lections have been made by Engli&s;h Gentlemen &s;ince that Time; and how all Europe has been rumag'd, as we may &s;ay, for Pictures to bring over h$ ther, where, for twenty Years, they yielded the Purcha&s;ers, &s;uch as collected them for Sale, immen&s;e Profit. But the Rates are abated &s;ince that, and we begin to be glutted with the Copies and Frauds of the Dutch and Flemi&s;h Painters, who have impo&s;ed gro&s;ly upon us. But to return to the Palace of Hamp|ton Court; Queen Mary liv'd not to &s;ee it compleatly fini&s;h'd; and her Death with the other Difficulties of that Reign put a &s;top to the Works for &s;ome Time till the King reviving his good liking of the Place, &s;et them to work again as we &s;ee it: But I have been a&s;&s;u$$ that had the Peace continu'd, and the King liv'd to enjoy the Continuance of it, his Maje&s;ty had re&s;olv'd to have pull'd down all the Remains of the old Building; &s;uch as the Chapel, and the large Court within the fir&s;t Gate, an$ to have built up the whole Palace after the manner of tho&s;e two Fronts already done. In the&s;e would have been a$ entire &s;ett of Rooms of State for the re|ceiving, and, if Need had been, l$$dg&punc;ing, and entertaining any foreign Prince, with his Retinue; al&s;o Offices for all the Secretaries of State, Lords of the Trea&s;u$, and of Trade; to have repair'd to for
<PB REF="113" MS="Y">
the Di&s;patch of &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s, as it might be nece&s;&s;ary to have done there upon the Kings longer Re&s;idence there than ordi|nary; as al&s;o Apartments for all the great Officers of the Hou&s;hold; &s;o that had the Hou&s;e had two great Squares added, as was de&s;ign'd, there would have been no Room to &s;pare, or that would not have been very well fill'd: But the King's Death put an end to all the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>Since the Death of K. William Hamp|ton Court &s;eem'd abandon'd of its Pa+tron: They have gotten a kind of Pro|verbial &s;aying relating to Hampton Court, viz. That it has been generally cho&s;en by every other Prince, &s;ince it became a Hou&s;e of Note. K. Charles was the fir&s;t tha$ delighted in it &s;ince Queen Eliza|beth's Time; as for the Reigns before, it was but newly forfeited to the Crown, and was not made a Royal Hou&s;e till King Charles I. who was not only a Prince that delighted in Country Retire|ments, but knew how to make Choice of them by the Beauty of their Situation, the Goodne&s;s of the Air, &amp;c. he took great Delight here, and had he liv'd to enjoy it in Peace, had purpos'd to make it another&punc; Thing than it was. But we all know what took him off from that Felicity, and all others; and this Hou&s;e was at la&s;t made one of his Pri|&s;ons by his Rebel&s;ious Subjects.</P>
<P>His Son, K. Charles II. may well be &s;aid to have an Aver&s;ion to the Place, for the Rea&s;on ju&s;t mention'd&punc; namely, the Treatment his Royal Father met with there; and particularly that the Rebel and Murderer of his Father, Cromwell, after|wards po&s;&s;e&s;s'd this Palace, and revel'd here in the Blood of the Royal Party, as he had done in that of his Sovereign King. Charles II&punc; therefore cho&s;e Wind&s;or, and be&s;tow'd a va&s;t Sum in beautifying the Ca&s;tle there, and which brought it to the Perfection we &s;ee it in at this Dry; &s;ome few Alterations excepted, done in the Time of Ki$g William.</P>
<P>King William, for King James is not to be named as to his Choice of retir'd Palaces, his Delight running quite ano|ther way; I &s;ay, King William fix'd up|on Hampton-Court; and it was in his Reign that Hampton Court put on new Cloaths, and being dre&s;s'd gay and glo|rious, made the Figure we now &s;ee it in.</P>
<P>The late Queen, taken up for Part of her Reign in her kind Regards to the Prince her Spou&s;e, was obliged to re&s;ide where her Care of his Health confin'd her, and in this Ca&s;e kept, for the mo&s;t Part at Ken&s;ington, where he died; but her Maje&s;ty always di&s;covered her Delight to be at Wind&s;or, where &s;he cho&s;e the little Hou&s;e, as 'twas called, oppo&s;ite to the Ca&s;tle, and took the Air in her Chai&s;e in the Parks and Fore&s;t, as &s;he &s;aw Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now Hampton-Court, by the like al|ternative&punc; is come into Reque&s;t again; and we find his late Maje&s;ty, who was a good Judge too of the Plea&s;antne&s;s and Situation of a Place of that Kind, did take Hampton-Court into his Favour, and made it much his Choice for the Summer's Retreat of the Court, and where they did then enjoy the Diver|&s;ions of the Sea&s;on; When Hampton-Court will find &s;uch another favourable Juncture as in King William's Time, when the remainder of her A&s;hes &s;hall be &s;wept away, and her compleat Fabric, as de&s;ign'd by King William &s;hall be fi|ni&s;h'd, I cannot tell; but if ever that &s;hall be, I know no Palace in Europe, Verfailles excepted, which can come up to her, either for Beauty or Magnifi|cence, or for Extent of Building, and the Ornaments attending it.</P>
<P>From Hampton Court I directed my my Cour&s;e for a Journey into the South We&s;t Part of England; and, to take up my Beginning where I concluded my la&s;t, I cro&s;s'd to Che$t&s;ey on the Thames, a Town I mention'd before; from whence cro&s;&s;ing the Black De&s;ert, as I call'd it, of Bag&s;hot Heath, I directed my Cour&s;e for Hamp&s;hire, or Hant&s;hire, and particular|ly for Ba&s;ing&s;toke; that is to &s;ay, that a little before I pa&s;s'd into the great we|&s;tern Road upon the Heath, &s;omewhat we&s;t of Bag&s;hot, at a Village call'd Black|water,
<PB REF="114" MS="Y">
and enter'd Hamp&s;hire, near Hart|leroe.</P>
<P>Before we reach Ba&s;ing&s;toke, we get rid of that unplea&s;ant Country, which I &s;o often call a De&s;art, and enter into a plea&s;ant fertile Country, enclo&s;ed and cul|tivated like the re&s;t of England; and pa&s;|&s;ing a Village or two, we enter Ba&s;ing|&s;toke, in the mid&s;t of Woods and Pa&s;tures, rich and fertile, and the Country accord|ingly &s;pread with the Hou&s;es of the No|bility and Gentry, as in other Places: On the Right Hand, a little before we come to the Town, we pa&s;s at a &s;mall Di&s;tance the famous Fortre&s;s, &s;o it was then, of Ba&s;ing, being a Hou&s;e belonging then to the Marqu&s;s of Winche&s;ter, the great An|ce&s;tor of the pre&s;ent Family of the Dukes of Bolton.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e, garri&s;on'd by a re&s;olute Band of old Soldiers, was a great Curb to the Rebels of the Parliament Party, al|mo&s;t thro' that whole War; till it was, after a vigorous Defence, yielded to the Conquerors, by the inevitable Fate of Things at that Time. The old Hou&s;e is indeed demoli&s;h'd; but the Succe&s;&s;or of the Family, the fir&s;t Duke of Bolton, has erected a very noble Fabrick in the &s;ame Place, or near it, which, however, is not equal to the Magnificence which Fame gives to the ancient Hou&s;e, who&s;e Strength of Building only, be&s;ides the Out-works, with&s;tood the Battery of Can|non in &s;everal Attacks, and repul&s;ed the Round-heads, three or four times, when they attempted to be&s;iege it: 'Tis in|credible what Booty the Garri&s;on of this Place picked up, lying as they did, ju&s;t on the We&s;tern Road, where they inter|cepted the Carriers, plunder'd the Wag|gons, and &s;uffered nothing to pa&s;s; to the great Interruption of the Trade of the City of London.</P>
<P>Ba&s;ing&s;toke is a large populous Market Town, has a good Market for Corn, and lately, within a very few Years, is fallen into a Manufacture, viz. Of making Druggets and Shallons, and &s;uch &s;light Goods, which, however, employs a good Number of the poor People, and enables them to get their Bread, which knew not how to get it before.</P>
<P>From hence the great We&s;tern Road goes on to Whitchurch and Andover, two Market Towns, and &s;ending Members to Parliament; at the la&s;t of which, the Downs, or open Country, begins, which we in general, tho' fal&s;ly, called Sali$|bury-Plain: But my Re&s;olution being to take in my view what I had pa&s;&s;ed by before; I was obliged to go off to the Left Hand, to Alresford and Winche|&s;ter.</P>
<P>Alresford was a flouri&s;hing Market Town, and remarkable for this; That tho' it had no great Trade, and particu|larly very little, if any Manufactures, yet there was no Collection in the Town for the Poor, nor any Poor low enough to take Alms of the Pari&s;h, which is what I do not think can be &s;aid of any Town in England be&s;ides.</P>
<P>But this unhappy Circum&s;tance, which &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed Alresford from all her Neighbours, was brought to an End in the Year&mdash;, when, by a &s;udden and &s;urprizing Fire, the whole Town, with both the Church and the Market-Hou&s;e, was reduc'd to a heap of Rubbi&s;h; and, except a few poor Hutts at the remo|te&s;t Ends of the Town, not a Hou&s;e left &s;tanding: The Town is &s;ince that very hand&s;omely rebuilt, and the neighbour|ing Gentlemen contributed largely to the Relief of the People, e&s;pecially, by &s;end|ing Timber towards their Building: al&s;o their Market hou&s;e is hand&s;omely built, but the Church not yet, tho' we hear there is a Fund rai&s;ing likewi&s;e for that.</P>
<P>Here is a very large Pond, or Lake of Water, kept up to a Head, by a &s;tro$$ Batterd'eau, or Dam, which the People tell us was made by the Romans; and that it is to this Day part of the great Roman Highway, which leads from Win|che&s;ter to Alton, and, as 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed went on to London, tho' we no where &s;ee any Remains of it, except between Winche&s;ter and Alton, and chiefly be|tween this Town and Alton.</P>
<P>Near this Town, a little North-We&s;t, the Duke of Bolton has another Seat, which, tho' not large, is a very hand&s;ome beautiful Palace, and the Gardens not only
<PB REF="115" MS="Y">
very exact, but very finely &s;ituate, the Pro&s;pect and Vi&s;to's Noble and Great, and the whole very well kept.</P>
<P>From hence, at the End of &s;even Miles over the Downs, we come to the very ancient City of Winche&s;ter; not only the great Church, which is &s;o famous all over Europe, and has been &s;o much talk'd of, but even the whole City has, at a Di&s;tance&punc; the Face of Venerable, and looks ancient a far off; and yet here are many modern Buildings too, and &s;ome very hand&s;ome; as the College Schools; with the Bi&s;hop's Palace, built by Bi&s;hop Morley, &s;ince the late Wars; the old Palace of the Bi&s;hop having been ruin'd by that known Church Incendiary, Sir William Waller, and his Crew of Plunderers; who, if my Information is not wrong, as I believe it is not, de|&s;troy'd more Monuments of the Dead, and defac'd more Churches, than all the Round-heads in England be&s;ide.</P>
<P>This Church, and the Schools, al&s;o are accurately de&s;crib'd by &s;everal Writers, e&s;pecially by the Mona&s;ticon, where their Antiquity and Original is fully &s;et forth: The Out&s;ide of the Church is as plain and Cour&s;e, as if the Founders and abhor'd Ornaments, or that William of Wickham had been a Quaker, or at $a&s;t a Quieti&s;t: There is neither Statue, or a Nich for a Statue, to be &s;een on all the Out&s;ide; no carv'd Work, no Spires, Towers, Pinacles, Balu&s;trades, or any Thing; but meer Walls, Buttre&s;&s;es, Win|dows, and Coins, nece&s;&s;ary to the Sup|port and Order of the Building. It has no Steeple, but a &s;hort Tower cover'd flat, as if the top of it had fallen down, and it had been cover'd in ha&s;te to keep the Rain out, till they had time to build it up again.</P>
<P>But the In&s;ide of the Church has many very good things in it, and worth Ob&s;er|vation; it was for &s;ome Ages the Burying Place of the Engli&s;h Saxon Kings; who&s;e Reliques, at the repair of the Church, were collected by Bi&s;hop Fox, and, be|ing put together into large Wooden Che&s;ts, lin'd with Lead were again in|terr'd at the Foot of the great Wall in the Choir, three on one Side, and three on the other; with an Account who&s;e Bones are in each Che&s;t, whether the Divi&s;ion of the Reliques might be depended upon, has been doubted, but is not thought ma|terial, &s;o that we do but believe they are all there.</P>
<P>The Choir of the Church appears very magnificent; the Roof is very high, and the Gothick Work in the arch d Part is very fine, tho' very old; the Painting in the Windows is admirably good, and ea&s;y to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by tho&s;e that un|der&s;tand tho&s;e Things: The Steps a&s;cend|ing to the Choir make a very fine Show, having the Statues of King James&punc; and his Son King Charles, in Copper, finely ca&s;t; the fir&s;t on the Right Hand&punc; and the other on the Left, as you go up to the Choir.</P>
<P>The Choir is &s;aid to be the longe&s;t in England; and as the Number of Preben|daries, Canons, &amp;c. are many, it re|quir'd &s;uch a length The Ornaments of the Choir are the Effects of the Boun|ty, of &s;everal Bi&s;hops; the fine Altar, (the noble&s;t in England by much&punc; was done by Bi&s;hop Morley; the Roof and the Coat of Arms of the Saxon and Norman K ngs, were done by Bi&s;hop Fox; and the fine Throne, for the Bi&s;hop in the Choir, was given by Bi&s;hop Mew, in his Life-time; nd it was well it was; for if he had order'd it by Will, there is Rea&s;on to believe it had never been done: That Reverend Prelate, notwith&s;tanding he enjoy'd &s;o rich a Bi&s;hoprick, &s;$arce leaving Money enough behind him, to pay for his Coffin.</P>
<P>There are a great many Per&s;ons of Rank bury'd in this Church, be&s;ides the Saxon Kings, mention'd above; and be&s;ides &s;e|veral of the mo&s;t eminent Bi&s;hops of the See: Ju&s;t under the Altar lyes a Son of William the Conqueror&punc; without any Monument; and behind the Altar, under a very fine and venerable Monument, lyes the famous Lord Trea&s;urer, We&s;ton, late Earl of Portland, Lord High Trea&s;urer of England under King Charles I. His Effigy is in Copper Armour, at full length, with his Head rais'd on three Cu&s;hions of the
<PB REF="116" MS="Y">
&s;ame, and is a very magnificent Work: There is al&s;o a very fine Monument of Cardinal Beaufort, in his Cardinal's Robes and Hat.</P>
<P>The Monument of Sir John Cloberry is extraordinary, but more, becau&s;e it puts Strangers upon enquiring into his Story, than for any thing wonderful in the Figure, it being cut in a modern Dre&s;s; the Habit Gentlemen wore in tho&s;e Times, which, being now &s;o much out of Fa&s;hion, appears mean enough: But this Gentleman's Story is particular, being the Per&s;on &s;olely entru&s;ted with the Secret of the Re&s;toration of K. Charles II. as the Me&s;&s;enger that pa&s;s'd between General Monk on one Hand, and Mr. Montague, and others entru&s;ted by King Charles II. on the other Hand: which he manag'd &s;o faithfully, as to effect that memorable Event, to which Eng|land owes the Felicity of all her happy Days &s;ince that Time, by which faithful Service, Sir John Cloberry, then a pri|vate Mu&s;queteer only, rais'd him&s;elf to the Honour of a Knight, with the Re|ward of a good E&s;tate from the Bounty of the King.</P>
<P>Every Body that goes into this Church, and reads what is to be read there, will be told, that the Body of the Church was built by the famous William of Wickham; who&s;e Monument, intimat|ing his Fame, lies in the middle of that Part, which was built at his Ex|pence.</P>
<P>He was a Courtier before a Bi&s;hop; and, tho' he had no great Share of Learn|ing, he was a great Promoter of it, and a Lover of learned Men&punc; His natural Ge|nius was much beyond his acquir'd Parts, and his Skill in Politicks beyond his Eccle|&s;ia&s;tick Knowledge. He is &s;aid to have put his Ma&s;ter. King Edward III. to whom he was Secretary of State, upon the two great Projects which made his Reign &s;o glorious, viz. Fir&s;t, Upon &s;et|ting up his Claim to the Crown of France, and pu&s;hing that Claim by Force of Arms, which brought on the War with France, in which that Prince was three times victorious in battle. (2.) Upon &s;etting up, or in&s;tituting the Order of the Garter; in which he (being before that made Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter) ob|tain'd the Honour for the Bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter, of being always Prelates of the Order, as an Appendix to the Bi|&s;hoprick; and he him&s;elf was the fir&s;t Prelate of the Order, and the En&s;igns of that Honour are join'd with his Epi&s;|copal Ornaments, in the robing of his Effigy on the Monument above.</P>
<P>To the Honour of this Bi&s;hop, there are other Foundations of his, as much to his Fame as that of this Church, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in their Order; but particularly the College in this City, which is a noble Foundation indeed: The Building con&s;i&s;ts of two large Courts, in which are the Lodgings for the Ma|&s;ters and Scholars, and in the Center a very noble Chapel; beyond that, in the &s;econd Court, are the Schools, with a large Cloy&s;ter beyond them, and &s;ome Enclo&s;ures laid open for the Diver&s;ion of the Scholars. There al&s;o is a great Hall, where the Scholars dine: The Funds for the Support of this College are very con|&s;iderable; the Ma&s;ters live in a very good Figure, and their Maintenance is &s;ufficient to &s;upport it: They have all &s;eparate Dwellings in the Hou&s;e and all po&s;&s;ible Conveniencies appointed them.</P>
<P>The Scholars have Exhibitions at a cer|tain Time of Countinuance $word$, if they plea&s;e to &s;tudy&punc; in the new College at Oxford, built by the &s;ame noble Bene|factor, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in its $word$</P>
<P>The Clergy here live at large, and ve+ry hand&s;omely, in the Clo&s;e belonging to the Cathedral; where, be&s;ides the Bi+&s;hop's Palace, mention'd above, are $word$ good Hou&s;es, and very hand&s;omely built for the Prebendaries, Canons, and othe$ Dignitaries of this Church. The Dea$$$ is a very plea&s;ant Dwelling, the Garden very larg, and the River running that them, but the Floods in Winter &s;ome times incommode the Gardens very much.</P>
<P>This School has fully an&s;wer'd the $word$ of the Founder, who, tho' he was no grea$
<PB REF="117" MS="Y">
Scholar, re&s;olv'd to erect a Hou&s;e for the $aking the Ages to come more learned $an tho&s;e that went before; and it has, $ay, fully an&s;wer'd the End, for many $arned and great Men have been rais'd $ere, &s;ome of whom we &s;hall have Oc|$&s;ion to mention as we go on.</P>
<P>Among the many private In&s;criptions $ this Church, we found one made by $word$. Over, once an eminent Phy&s;ician in $is City, on a Mother and Child who, $eing his Patients, died together, and $ere bury'd in the &s;ame Grave, and $hich intimate, that one died of a Fever, $nd the other of a Drop&s;y.</P>
<P>$urrepuit natum $ebris matrem Ab&s;tulit Hydrops, Igne Prior fatis, altera Ce$$$t Aqua.</P>
<P>As the City it &s;elf &s;tands in a Vale on $he Bank, and at the Conju$ction of two $mall Rivers, &s;o the Country $i&s;ing every Way, but ju&s;t as the Cour&s;e of the Wa|$er keeps the Valley open, you m$&s;t ne|$e&s;&s;arily, as you go out of the Gates, go $p Hill every Way: But when on$e a&s;|$ended, you come to the mo&s;t charming Plains, and mo&s;t plea&s;ant Country of that kind in England; which continues, with very &s;mall Inter&s;ections of Rivers $nd Valleys, for above fifty Miles, as &s;hall $ppear in the &s;equel of this Journey.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t-Gate of this City was an|tiently a Ca&s;tle, known to be &s;o by the Ruins, more than by an extraordinary Notice taken of it in Hi&s;tory: What they &s;ay of it, that the Saxon Kings kept their Court here, is doubtful, and mu&s;t be meant of the We&s;t Saxons only; and as to the Tale of King Arthur's round $a|$le, which, they prerend, was kept here $or him, and his two Dozen of Knights; which Table hangs up &s;till, as a Piece of Antiquity, to the Tune of 1200 Years, and has, as they pretend, the Names of the &s;aid Knights in Saxon Characters, and yet &s;uch as no Man can read. All this Story I &s;ee &s;o little Ground to give the $ea&s;t Credit to, that I look upon it, and't &s;hall plea&s;e you, to be no better than a Fib$.</P>
<P>Where this Ca&s;tle &s;tood, or whateve el&s;e it was, for &s;ome &s;ay there was no Ca&s;tle there, the late King Charles II. mark'd out, a very noble De&s;ign; which had he liv'd, would certainly have made that Part of the Country, the New Mar|ket of the Ages to come; for the Coun|try hereabout far excels that of New-Market Heath, for all kinds of Sport and Diver&s;ion, fit for a Prince, no Body can di&s;pute; and a$ the De&s;ign included, a noble Palac$, &s;ufficient like Wind&s;or, for a Summer Re&s;idence of the whole Court, it would certainly have diverted the King from his Cur&s;ory Journeys to New-Mar|ket.</P>
<P>The Plan of this Hou&s;e has receiv'd &s;everal Alterations; and as it is never like to be fini&s;h d, 'tis &s;carce worth recording the Va$iety: The Building is begun, and the Front next the City carry'd up to the $word$, and $word$, but the remainder is not begun: There was a Street of Hou&s;es $span$ from the Gate of the Palace $span$ Town, but it was n$ver $span$ the Park mark: out $span$ large ne$ ten Miles in $word$, and ended We&s;t upon the $word$ Downs, in view of the Town of Stockbridge.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e was afterwards &s;ettled with a Royal Revenue al&s;o, as an Ap|penage, e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Parliament upon Prince $eo$ge of Denmark for his Life, in ca&s;e he had out-liv'd the Queen: But his Royal Highne&s;s dying before $er Ma|je&s;ty, all hope of &s;eein this De&s;ign per|fected, or the Hou&s;e fini&s;h'd, is now va|ni&s;h$d.</P>
<P>I cannot omit that the$e are &s;everal publick Edifices in this $ity, and in the Neighbour hood; as the Ho&s;pitals, and the Building adjoining near the Ea&s;t G$te; and towards the North, a Piece of an old Mona&s;try undemoli&s;h'd, and which is &s;till pre&s;erv'd to the Religion, being the Re&s;idence of &s;ome private Roman Ca|tholick Gentlemen, where they have an Oratory, and, as they &s;ay, live &s;till ac|cording to the Rule of St. Benedict. This Building is call'd Hide Hou&s;e; and, as they live very u&s;efully and, to the highe&s;t

<P>Winche&s;ter is a Place of no Trade, o|ther than is naturally occa&s;ion'd by the Inhabitants of the City and neighbouring Villages, one with another: Here is no Manufacture, no Navigation; there was indeed an Attempt to make the River navigable from Southampton, and it was once made practicable; but it never an&s;wered the Expence, &s;o as to give Encouragement to the Undertakers.</P>
<P>Here is a great deal of good Compa|ny; and abundance of Gentry being in the Neighbourhood, it adds to the &s;ociable|ne&s;s of the Place: The Clergy al&s;o here are, generally &s;peaking very rich, and very numerous.</P>
<P>As there is &s;uch good Company, &s;o they are gotten into that new-fa&s;hion'd Way of conver&s;ing by A&s;&s;emblies: I &s;hall do no more than mention them here; they are plea&s;ant and agreeable to the young People, and &s;ome times fatal to them, of which, in its Place; Win|che&s;ter has its Share of the Mirth: May it e&s;cape the ill Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The Ho&s;pital on the South of this City, at a Miles di&s;tance on the Road to Southampton, is worth Notice: 'Tis &s;aid to be founded by King William Ru|fus, but was not endow'd or appointed till later Times by Cardinal Beaufort. Every Traveller that knocks at the Door of this Hou&s;e, in his Way, and asks for it, claims the Relief of a piece of white Bread and a cup of Beer; and this Do|nation is &s;till continued; a Quantity of good Beer is &s;et apart every Day to be given away; and what is left, is di&s;tri|buted to other Poor, but none of it kept to the next Day.</P>
<P>How the Revenues of this Ho&s;pital, which &s;hould maintain the Ma&s;ter and thirty private Gentlemen, who they call Fellows, but ou ht to call Brothers, is now reduc'd to maintain only fourteen, while the Ma&s;ter lives in a Figure equal to the be&s;t Gentleman in the Country, would be well worth the Enquiry of a proper Vi&s;itor, if &s;uch can be nam'd: 'Tis a Thing worthy of Complaint, whe$ publick Charities, de&s;ign'd for the Relie$ of the Poor, are embezzel'd and depre+dated by the rich, and turn'd to the Support of Luxury and Pride.</P>
<P>From Winche&s;ter, is about 25 Miles and over the mo&s;t charming Plains that can any where be &s;een, (far in my Opi|nion) excelling the Plains of Mecca, we come to Salisbury; the va&s;t Flocks of Sheep, which one every where &s;ees up&punc;upon the&s;e Downs, and the great Num|ber of tho&s;e Flocks, is a Sight truly worth Ob&s;ervation; 'tis ordinary for the&s;e Flocks to contain from 3 to 5000 in a Flock; and &s;everal private Farmers hereabouts have two or three &s;uch Flocks.</P>
<P>But 'tis mo&s;t remarkable &s;till; how a great part of the&s;e Downs comes by a new Method of Husbandry, to be not only made Arable, which they never were in former days, but to bear excellent Wheat, and great Crops tho' otherwi&s;e poor barren Land, and never known to our Ance&s;tors to $e capable of any &s;uch Thing; nay, they would perhaps have laugh'd at any one that would have gone about to plough up the wild Downs and Hills, where the Sheep were wont to go: But Experience has made the pre&s;e$t Age wi|&s;er, and more skilful in Husbandry; for by only folding the Sheep upon the plow'd Lands, tho&s;e Lands, wh ch otherwi&s;e are barren, and where the Plow goes within three or four Inches of the &s;olid Rock of Chalk, are made fruitful, and bear very good Wheat, as well as Rye and Barley: I &s;hall &s;ay more of this when I come to &s;peak of the &s;ame Practice farther in the Country.</P>
<P>This plain Country conti ues in length from Winche&s;ter to Salisbury 25 Miles, from thence to Dorche&s;ter 22 Miles, thence to Weymouth 6 Miles, &s;o that they lie near 50 Miles in leng h, and breadth; they r ach al&s;o in &s;ome Places 35 to 40 Miles: They who would make any prac|ticable Gue&s;s at the Number of Sheep u&s;ually fed on the&s;e Downs, may take it from a Calculation made, as I was told, at Do$che&s;ter, that there were 600000 Sheep fed within &s;ix Miles of that Town,
<PB REF="119">
mea&s;uring every Way round, and the Town in the Center.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;s'd this plain Country, we &s;ay a great many old Camps, as well Roman as Briti&s;h, and &s;everal Remains of the ancient Inhabitants of this King|dom, and of their Wars, Battles, En|trenchments, Encampments, which are indeed very agreeable to a Traveller, that has read any thing of the Hi&s;tory of the Country. Old Sarum is as re|markable as any of the&s;e, where there is a double Entrenchment, with a deep Gra$$e, or Ditch, to either of them; the Area about 100 Yards in Diameter, tak|ing in the whole Crown of the Hill, and thereby rendering the A&s;cent very difficult: Near this, there is one Farm Hou&s;e, which is all the Remains I could &s;ee of any Town in or near the Place, for the Encampment has no Re&s;emblance of a Town; and yet this is call'd the Borough of old Sarum, and &s;ends two Members to Parliament, who, tho&s;e Members can ju&s;tly &s;ay, they repre&s;ent, would be hard for them to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Some will have it, that the old City of Sorbiodunum, or Salisbury, &s;tood here, and was afterwards, for I know not what Rea&s;ons, remov'd to the low mar&s;hy Grounds, among the Rivers, where at now &s;tands: But as I &s;ec no Authority for it, other than mere Tradition. I be|lieve my Share of it, and take it ad re|ferendum.</P>
<P>Salisbury it&s;elf is indeed a large and plea&s;ant City; tho' I do not think it all the plea&s;anter for that which they boa&s;t &s;o much of; namely, the Water running th$o' the middle of every Street, or that it adds any thing to the Beauty of the Place, but ju&s;t the contrary; it keeps the Streets always dirty, full of Wet and Filth, and Weeds, even in the middle of Summer.</P>
<P>The City is plac'd upon the Conflu|ence of two large Rivers, the Avon and the Willy, either of them con&s;iderable Rivers, but very large, when joyn'd to|gether, and yet larger when they receive a third River&punc; viz the N$ddi$, which $oy$s them $word$ Claren$on Park, about three Miles below the City; then, with a deep Channel, and a Current le&s;s rap|pid, they run down to Chri&s;t Church, which is their Port, and where they empty them&s;elves into the Sea from that Town upwards, towards Salisbury, they are made navigable too within two Miles, and might be &s;o quite into the City, where it not for the Strength of the Stream.</P>
<P>As the City of Winche&s;ter is a City without Trade, that is to &s;ay, without any particular Manufactures; &s;o this Ci|ty of Salisbury, and all the County of Wilts, of which it is the Capital, are full of great Variety of Manufactures; and tho&s;e &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able in England; namely, the Clo$th|ing Trade, and the Trade of Flan$els, Druggets, and &s;everal other &s;orts of Ma|nufactures, of which in their Order.</P>
<P>The City of Salisbury has two re|markable Manufactures carried on in it, and which employ the Poor of great Part of the Country round: namely, fine Flan|nels, and long Cloths for the Turkey Trade, call'd Salisbury Whites: The People of Salisbury are gay and rich, and have a flouri&s;hing Trade; and there is a great deal of good Manners and good Company among them; I mean, among the Citizens, be&s;ides what is found among the Gentlemen; for there are many good Families in Salisbury, be&s;ides the Citi|zens.</P>
<P>This Society has a great Addition from the Clo&s;s&punc; that is to &s;ay, the Circle of Ground wall'd in adjacent to the Cathe|dral; in which the Families of the Pre|bendaries and Commons, and others of the Clergy belonging to the Cathedral have their Hou&s;es, as is u&s;ual in all Ci|ties where there are Cathedral Churches. The&s;e are &s;o con&s;iderable here, and the Place &s;o large, that it is (as it is call'd in general) like another City</P>
<P>The Cathedral is famous for the height of its Spire, which is without Exception the highe&s;t and the hand&s;ome&s;t in Eng|land, being from the Ground 410 Foo$, and yet the Walls &s;o exceeding Thin, that at t$e upper Part of the Spire up|on

a View made by the late Sir Chri&s;to|pher Wren, the Wall was found to be le&s;s than five Inches thick; upon which a Con|&s;ultation was had, whether Spire, or at lea&s;t the upper Part of it &s;hould be taken down, it beyond being &s;uppo&s;ed to have received &s;ome Damage by the great Storm in the Year 1703; but it was re&s;olved in the Negative, and Sir Chri&s;topher order'd it to be &s;o &s;trengthen'd with B$nds of of Iron Plates, as has effectually &s;ecured it; and I have heard &s;ome of the be&s;t Ar|chitects &s;ay, it is &s;tronger now than when it was fir&s;t built.</P>
<P>They tell us here long Stories of the great Art u&s;ed in laying the fir&s;t Founda|tion of this Church; the Ground being mar&s;hy and wet, occa&s;ioned by the Chan|nels of the Rivers; that it was laid upon piles occording to &s;ome, and upon Wool|packs according to others; but this is not &s;uppo&s;ed by tho&s;e who know, that the whole Country is one Rock of Chalk, even from the Tops of the highe&s;t Hills to the Bottom of the deepe&s;t Rivers.</P>
<P>They tell us, this Church was forty Years a building, and co&s;t an immen&s;e Sum of Money, but it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged that the in&s;ide of the Work is not an&s;werable in the Decoration of Things, to the Workman&s;hip without; the Paint|ing in the Choir is mean, and more like the ordinary Method of common Drawing Room, or Tavern painting, than that of a Church; the Carving is good, but very little of it, and it is rather a fine Church than finely &s;et off.#</P>
<P>The ordinary Boa&s;t of this Building, that there were as many Gates as Months, as many Windows as Days, as many m$r|ble Pillars as H$urs in the Year, is now no Recommendation at all. However the menti n of it mu&s;t be pre&s;erved.</P>
<LG>
<L>As many Days as in One Year there be,</L>
<L>So many Windows in One Church we &s;ee;</L>
<L>As many Marble Pillars there appear,</L>
<L>As there are Hours throughout the fleet-Year;</L>
<L>As many Gates as Moons one Year do View:</L>
<L>Strange Tale to tell, yet not mo$$ &s;trange than true.</L>
</LG>
<P>There are however &s;ome very fine Monuments in this Church; particularly one belonging to the Noble Family of Seymours, &s;ince Dukes of Somer&s;et, (and Ance&s;tors of the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing Fa|mily,) which on a mo&s;t melancholly Oc|ca&s;ion has been now lately open'd again to receive the Body of the late Dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et, the happy Con&s;ort for almo&s;t 40 Years of his Grace the pre&s;ent Duke; and only Daughter and Heire&s;s of the antient and Noble Family of Piercy, Earls of Northumberland, who&s;e great E&s;tate &s;he brought into the Family of Somer&s;et, who now enjoy it.</P>
<P>With her was bury'd at the &s;ame time her Graces Daughter the Marchione&s;s of Caermarthen, being married to the Mar|quis of Caermarthen, Son and Heir ap|parent to the Lord of Leeds, who dy'd for Grief at the lo&s;s of the Dutche&s;s her Mother, and was buried with her; al&s;o her &s;econd Son the Duke Pier$y Somer|&s;et, who died a few Months before, and had been buried in the Abbey Church of We&s;tmin&s;ter, but was order'd to be re|mov'd and laid here with the Ance&s;tors of his Hou&s;e; and I hear his Grace de|&s;igns to have a yet more magnificent Monument erected in this Cathedral for them, ju&s;t by the other, which is there already.</P>
<P>How the Dukes of Somer&s;et c$me to quit this Church for thir bur$ing Place, and be laid in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, that I know not; but 'tis certain that the pre&s;ent Duke has cho&s;en to have his Family $$d here with their Ance&s;tors, and to that End has cau&s;ed the Corp&s;e of his Son the Lord P$ercy, as above, and one of his Daughters who had been buried in the Ab|bey, to be remov'd and brought down to this Vault, which lies in that they call the Virgin Mary's Chappel behind the Altar. There is, as above, a noble Mo|nument for a late Duke and Dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et in the Place already; with their Pourtraits at full Length, their Heads lying upon Cu&s;hions, the whole
<PB N="119" REF="123">
perfectly well wrought in fine poli&s;h'd $word$ Marble, and their Sons kneeling by them; tho&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e to be the Fa|ther of the Great Duke of Somer&s;et, U$|cle to King Edward IV. but after this the Family lay in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, where there is al&s;o a fine Monument for that very Duke who was beheaded by Edward VI. and who was the great Patron of the Reformation.</P>
<P>Among other Monuments of Noble Men in this Cathedral they &s;how you one that is very extraordinary, and to which there hangs a Tale: There was in the Reign of Philip and Mary a very unhappy Murder committed by the then Lord Sturton, or Stourton, a Family &s;ince Extinct, but well known till within a few Years in that Country.</P>
<P>This Lord Stourton being guilty of the &s;aid Murder, which al&s;o was aggravated with very bad Circum&s;tances, could not obtain the u&s;ual Grace of the Crown, viz to be beheaded, but Queen Mary po&s;itively ordered that like a common Malefactor he &s;hould die at the Gallows: After he was hang'd his Friends de&s;iring to have hi$ bury'd at Salisbury, the Bi|&s;hop would not Con&s;ent that he &s;hould be buried in the Cathedral&punc; unle&s;s as a farther Mark of Infamy, his Friends would &s;ubmit to this Condition, viz. That the &s;ilken Halter in which he was hang'd &s;hould be hanged up over his Grave in the Church, as a Monument of his Crime; which was accordingly done, and there it is to be &s;een to this Day.</P>
<P>The putting this Halter up here, was not &s;o wonderful to me as it was, that the Po&s;terity of that Lord, who remain'd in good Rank &s;ometime after, &s;hould never prevail to have that Mark of Infamy taken off from the Memory of their An|ce&s;tor.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other Monuments in this Cathedral, as particularly of two No|blemen of antient Families in Scot|land, one of the Name of Hay, and one of the Name of Gordon; but they give us nothing of their Hi&s;tory, &s;o that we mu&s;t be content to &s;ay there they lie, and that's all.</P>
<P>The Cloy&s;ter, and the Chapter-Hou&s;e adjoining to the Church, are the fine&s;t here of any I have &s;een in England; the latter is Octogon, or Eight Square, and is 250 Foot in its Circumference; the Roof bearing ll upon one &s;mall Marble Pillar in the Center, which you may &s;hake with your Hand; and it is hardly to be imagin'd it can be any great Sup|port to the Roof, which makes it the more curious it is not indeed to be match'd I believe in Europe.</P>
<P>From hence directing my Cour&s;e to the Sea &s;ide in Pur&s;$it of my fir&s;t De&s;ign, viz. of viewing the whole Coa&s;t of England. I left the great Road, and went down the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the River towards New For|re&s;t, and Lymington; and he$e I &s;aw the ancient Hou&s;e and Seat of Clarendon the Man&s;ion of the ancient of Hide, An|ce&s;tors of the great Earl of Clarendon, and from whence his Lord&s;hip was hon|our'd with that Title, or the Hou&s;e erected into an Honour in favour of his Family.</P>
<P>But this being a large County, and full of memorable Branches of Antiquity, and modern Curio&s;ity, <HI>I</HI> cannot quit my Ob|&s;ervations &s;o &s;oon, but being happily fix'd by the Favour of a particular Friend at &s;o beautiful a Spot of Ground as this of Clarendon Park I made &s;everal little Excur&s;ions from hence to view the Nor|thern Parts of this County; a County &s;o fruitful of Wonders, that tho' I do not make Antiquity my chief Search, yet I mu&s;t not pa&s;s it over inti$ely&punc; where &s;o much of it, and &s;o well worth Ob&s;erva|tion is to be found, which would look as if I either under&s;tood not the value of the Study, or expected my Readers &s;hould be &s;atisfy'd with a total Omi&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>I have mention'd that this County is generally a va&s;t continu'd Body of high Chalky Hills, who&s;e Tops &s;pread them|&s;elves into fruitful and plea&s;ant Downs and Plains, upon which great Flo$ks of Sheep are fed, &amp;c. But the Reader is de&s;ir'd to ob&s;erve the&s;e Hills and Plains are mo&s;t beautifully Inter&s;ected, and cut thro' by the Cou$&s;e of divers plea&s;ant
<PB REF="124" MS="Y">
and profitable Rivers; in the Cour&s;e, and near the Banks, of which there always is a Chain of fruitful Meadows, and rich Pa&s;tures, and tho&s;e inter&s;pers'd with in|numerable plea&s;ant Towns, Villages, and Hou&s;es, and among them many of con|&s;iderable Magnitude; &s;o that while you view the Downs, and think the Country wild and uninhabited; yet when you come to de&s;cend into the&s;e Vales you are &s;urpris'd with the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fer|tile Country in England.</P>
<P>There are no le&s;s than four of the&s;e Rivers which meet all together, at, or near the City of Salisbury, e&s;pecially the Waters of thr$e of them run thro' the Streets of the City; the Nadder and the Willy. and the Avon, and the Cour&s;e of the&s;e three lead us thro' the whole Mountainous Part of the County, the two fir&s;t joyn their Waters a$ Wilton; the Shire-Town, tho' a Place of no great Notice now; and the&s;e are the Waters which run thro' the Canal, and the Gar|dens of Wilton-Hou&s;e, the Seat of that Ornament of Nobility, and Learning the Earl of Pembroke.</P>
<P>One cannot be &s;aid to have &s;een any thing that a Man of Curio&s;ity would think worth &s;eeing in this County, and not have been at Wilton Hou&s;e; but not the beautiful Building not the antient Trophy of a great Family, not the noble Scituation, not all the Plea&s;ures of the Gardens, Parks, Fountains, Hare-War|ren, or of whatever is Rare; either in Art or Nature are equal to, that yet more glorious Sight, of a noble Princely Palace, con&s;tantly filled with its noble and proper Inhabitants; viz. the Lord and Proprietor, who is indeed a true Pa|triarchal Monarch, reigns here with an Authority agreeable to all his Subjects (Family); and his reign is made agree|able, by his fir&s;t practi&s;ing the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite Government of him&s;elf, and then guiding all under him by the Rules of Honour and Vertue; being al&s;o h$$&s;elf perfectly Ma&s;ter of all the needful Arts of Family Government; I mean needful to make that Government, both Ea&s;y, and Plea&s;ant to tho&s;e who are under it, and who therefore willingly, and by Choice conform to it.</P>
<P>Here an exhaulted Genius is the In|&s;tructor, a glorious Example the Guide, and a Gentle well directed Hand the Governour and Law giver to the whole; and the Family like a well govern'd City appears Happy, Flouri&s;hing and Regular, groaning under no Grievance, pleas'd with what they Enjoy, and Enjoying every Thing which they ought to be pleas'd with.</P>
<P>Nor is the ble&s;&s;ing of this noble Re|&s;ident extended to the Family only, but even to all the Country round, who in their Degree feel the Effects of the ge|neral Beneficence; and where the Neigh|bourhood, however Poor receive all the good they can Expect, and are &s;ure to have no Injury, or Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Canal before the Hou&s;e lyes Pa|rallel with the Road, and receives into it the whole River Willey, or at lea&s;t is able to do &s;o; it may indeed be &s;aid that the River is made into a Canal; when we come into the Court-Yards be|fore the Hou&s;e there are &s;everal peice, of Antiquity to entertain the curious; as particularly, a noble Column of Porphy|ry, with a Marble State of Venus on the Top of i$. In Italy, and e&s;pecially at Rome and Naples, we &s;ee a great Va|riety of fine Columns, and &s;ome of them of excellent Workman&s;hip, and Antiqui|ty, and at &s;ome of the Courts of the Princes of Italy the like is &s;een; as e&s;pe|cially at the Court of Florence; but i$ England I do not remember to have &s;een any thing like this, which as they told me is Two and Thirty Foot high, and of excellent Workman&s;hip, and that it came la&s;t from Candia, but formerly from Alexandri, what may belong to the Hi&s;tory of it any further, I &s;uppo&s;e is not known, at lea&s;t they could tell me no more of it, who &s;hew'd it me.</P>
<P>On the left of the Court was former|ly a large Grotto, and curious Water-Works, and in a Hou&s;e, or Shed, or Part of the Building, which open'd with two Doors like a Coach-hou&s;e, a large E|que&s;trian Statue of one of the Ance&s;tors
<PB REF="125" MS="Y">
of one of the Ance&s;tors of the Family in compleat Armour, as al&s;o another of a Roman Emperor in Bra&s;s, but the la&s;t time I had the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee this Hou&s;e, I mi&s;t that Part; &s;o that I &s;uppos'd they were remov'd.</P>
<P>As the pre&s;ent Earl of Pembroke, the Lord of this fine Palace, is a Nobleman of great Per&s;onal Merit, many other Ways; &s;o he is a Man of Learning, and Reading, beyond mo&s;t Men of his Lord|&s;hip's high Rank in this Nation, if not in the World; and as his Reading has made him a Ma&s;ter of Antiquity and Judge of &s;uch peices of Antiquity, as he has had Opportunity to meet with in his own Travels, and otherwi&s;e in the World; $o it has given him a love of the Study, and made him a Collector of valuable Things, as well $word$ Painting as in Sculp|ture, and other Excellencies of Ar$&punc; as al&s;o of Nature; in &s;o much that Wil-on-Hou&s;e is now a meer Mu&s;oeum, $r a Chamber of Raritres, and we meet with &s;everal Things there which are to be found no were el&s;e in the World</P>
<P>As his Lord&s;hip is a great Collector of fine Paintings, &s;o I know no Nobleman's Hou&s;e in England, &s;o prepar'd, as if built on purpo&s;e to receive them, the large&s;t and the fine&s;t Peices that can be imagin'd extant in the World, might have found a Place here capable to receive them, I &s;ay, they might have found&punc; as if they could not now, which is in part true; for at pre&s;ent the whole Hou&s;e is &s;o compleat|ly fill'd, that I &s;ee no room for any new peice to crowd in, without Di&s;placing &s;ome other fine Peice that hung there be|fore; as for the value of the Peice, that might &s;o offer to &s;ucceed the Di&s;plac'd, that the great Judge of the whole Col|lection, the Earl him&s;elf mu&s;t Determine, and as his Judgment is perfectly good. the be&s;t Picture would be &s;ure to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Place. In a Word. Here is without doubt the be&s;t, if nor the greate&s;t Col|lection of Rarities, and Paintings that are to be &s;een together, in any one Noble|man's, or Gentleman's Hou&s;e in England. The peice of our Saviour wa&s;hing his Di&s;ciple Feet, which they &s;hew you in one of the fir&s;t Rooms you go into, mu&s;t be &s;poken of by every body that has any Knowledge of Painting, and is an ad|mirable peice indeed.</P>
<P>You a&s;cend the great Stair Ca&s;e, at the Upper End of the Hall, which is very Large&punc; at the Foot of the Stair-ca&s;e you have a Bacchus large as the Life, done with fine Pelopone&s;ian Marble; carrying a young Bacchus on his Arm, the young one eating Grapes, and letting you &s;ee by his Countenance, that he is pleas'd with the Ta&s;t of them&punc; nothing can be done finer, or more lively Repre&s;ent the $hing intended; namely, the Gu&s;t of the Ap|petite, which if i be nor a Pa&s;&s;ion, '$is an Affection, which is as much &s;een in the Countenance, perhaps more than any other. One ought to &s;top every two Steps of this Stair ca&s;e as we go up to $on|template the va&s;t Varie $word$ of Pictures, that Cover the Walls, and of &s;$me of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters in Europe, and yet this is but an Introduction to what is beyond them.</P>
<P>When you are enter'd the Appart|ments, &s;uch Variety &s;eizes you every way that you &s;car&s;e know to which hand to turn your elf Fir&s;t, on one $span$ you &s;ee &s;everal Rooms $ill'd with Paintings, as before, all &s;o curious, and the Va iety &s;uch, that 'tis with Reluctance, that you can turn from them: while looking ano|ther way, you are call'd off by a va&s;t Collection of Bu&s;to's, and Peices of the greate&s;t Antiquity of the Kind both Greek, and Romans; among the&s;e, there is one of the Roman Empe or, Marcus Aurelius in Ba&s;&s;o Relievo&punc; I never &s;aw any thing like what Appears here ex|cept in the Chamber of Rarieties a$ Mun|ick in Bavaria.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e, you come into &s;everal large Rooms, as if contriv'd for the Re|ception of the beautiful Gue&s;s that take them up; one of the&s;e is near 70 Foot long and the Ceiling 26 Foot high, with another adjoyning of the &s;ame Height, and Breadth, but not &s;o long.

<P>This Peice fills the farther End of the Great Room which I ju&s;t now mention|ed, it contains the Earl of Montgomery, Ance&s;tor of the Hou&s;e of Herbert, not then Earls of Pembroke, and his Lady, fitting, and as big as the Life; there are about them, their own five Sons, and one Daughter, and their Daughter-in-Law, who was Daughter of the Duke of Buckingham, marry'd to the elder Lord Herbert, their elde&s;t Son; it is enough to &s;ay of this Peice, 'tis worth the La|bour of any lover of Art to to 500 Miles to &s;ee it; and I am inform'd &s;everal Gen|tlemen of Quality have come from France almo&s;t on purpo&s;e; It would be Endle&s;s to de&s;cribe the whole Set of the Family Pictures, which take up this Room, un|le&s;s we would enter into the Roof-tree of the Family, and &s;et down a Genealogical Line of the whole Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>After we have &s;een this fine range of Beauties, for &s;uch indeed they are; far from being at an End of your Surprize, you have three or four Rooms &s;till upon the fame Floor, fill'd with Wonders, as before: Nothing can be finer than the Pictures them&s;elves, nothing more Sur|pri&s;ing than the Number of them; at length you De&s;cend the Back-Stairs, which are in them&s;elves large, tho' not like the other: However, not a Hands Breadth is left to crowd a Picture in of the &s;mal|le&s;t Size, and even the Upper Rooms, which might be call'd Garrets, are not naked, but have &s;ome very good Peices in them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Genius of the noble Collector may be &s;een in this glo|rious Collection, than which, take them together, there is not a finer in any pri|vate Hand in Europe, and in no Hand at all in Britain, Private or Publick.</P>
<P>The Gardens are on the South of the Hou&s;e, and extend them&s;elve beyond the River, a Branch of which runs thro' one Part of them, and &s;till South of the Gardens in the Great Park, which ex|tending beyond the Vale, Mounts the Hill opening at the la&s;t to the Great Down, which is properly call'd by way of Di&s;tinction, Salisbury-Plain, and leads from the City of Salisbury, to Shaftsbu|ry; here al&s;o his Lord&s;hip has a Hare-Warren (as 'tis call'd) tho' improperly; it has indeed been a Sanctury for the Hares for many Years; but the Gentle|men complain that it marrs their Game, for that as &s;oon as they put up a Hare for their Sport, if it be any where with|in two or three Miles, away &s;he runs for the Warren, and there is an End of their Pur&s;uit; on the other Hand, it makes all the Countrymen turn Poachers, and de&s;troy the Hares, by what means they can; but this is a &s;maller Matter, and of no great Import one way or o|ther.</P>
<P>From this Plea&s;ant and agreeable Days work, I return'd to Clarendon, and the next Day took another &s;hort Tour to the Hills, to &s;ee that celebrated peice of An|tiquity, the wonderful Stone-Henge, be|ing &s;ix Miles from Salisbury, North, and and upon the Side of the River Avon, near the Town of Amesbury: 'Tis need|le&s;s, that I &s;hould enter here into any part of the Di&s;pute about, which our learned Antiquaries have &s;o puzzl'd them|&s;elves, that &s;everal Books, and one of them, in Folio, has been yubli&s;h'd about it; &s;ome alleding it to be a Heathen, or Pagan Temple, and Altar, or Place of Sacrifice, as Mr. Jones; others, a Monu|ment or Trophy of Victory; others a Monument for the Dead, as Mr. Aubury, and the like: Again, &s;ome will have it be Briti&s;h, &s;ome Dani&s;h, &s;ome Saxon, &s;ome Roman, and &s;ome before them all, Phenician.</P>
<P><PB REF="127" MS="Y">
I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e it, as the Majority of all Writers do, to be a Monument for the Dead, and the rather, becau&s;e Mens Bones have been frequently dug up in the Ground near them. The common Opinion that no Man could ever count them, that a Baker carry'd a Basket of Bread, and laid a Loaf upon every Stone, and yet could never make out the &s;ame Number twice. This I take, as a meer Country Fiction, and a Ridiculous one too; the Rea&s;on why they cannot ea&s;ily $word$ told, is that many of them lie half, or part buried in the Ground, and a peice here, and a piece there, only appearing above the Gra&s;s, it cannot be known ea|&s;ily, which belong to one Stone, and which to another, or which are &s;eparate Stones, and which are joined under Ground to another; otherwi&s;e, as to tho&s;e which appear, they are ea&s;ie to be told, and I have &s;een them told four Times af|ter one another, beginning every Time at $ different Place, and every Time they amounted in 72 in all; but then this was counting every piece of a Stone of bulk, which appear'd at above the Surface of $he Earth, and was not evidently part of, and adjoining to another, to be a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate Body, or Stone by $t &s;elf.</P>
<P>The form of this Monument is not only de&s;crib'd but delineated in mo&s;t Au|thors, and indeed 'tis hard to know the $r&s;t, but by the la&s;t; the Figure was at $r&s;t Circular, and there were at lea&s;t our Rows or Circles, within one another; $e main Stones were placed upright, $nd they were join'd on the Top by Cro&s;s $tones, laid from one to another, and a&s;tn'd with va&s;t Mortices and Tenants: $ength of time has &s;o decay'd them, $at not only mo&s;t of the cro&s;s Stones which lay on the Top are fallen down, $ut many of the Upright al&s;o, notwith|standing the weight of them is &s;o prodi+$ious great: How they came thither, or $om whence, no Stones of that Kind $ing now to be found in any Part of Eng|nd near it, is &s;till the Mi&s;tery, for they $e of &s;uch immen&s;e Bulk that no Engines, or Carriages which we have in u&s;e in this Age could &s;tir them.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s they had &s;ome Method in former Days in foreign Counties, as well as here, to move heavier Weights then we find practicable now: How el&s;e did Solomon's Workmen build the Battlement or additional Wall to Support the Preci|peice of Mount Moriah, on which the Temple was built? which was all built of great Stones of Parian Marble, each Stone being forty Cubits long, and four|teen Cubits broad, and eight Cubits high, or thick, which reckoning each Cubit at two Foot and a half of our Mea&s;ure, as the Learned agree to do, was 100 Foot long, 35 Foot broad, and 20 Foot thick.</P>
<P>The&s;e Stones at Stonehenge, as Mr. Cambden de&s;cribes them, and in which others agree, were very large, tho' not &s;o large, the upright Stones 24 Foot high, 7 Foot broad; 16 Foot round, and weight 12 Ton each; and the cro&s;s Stone on the Top, which he calls Coronets, were 6 or 7 Ton, but this does not &s;eem equal, for if the cro&s;s Stones weigh'd &s;ix, or &s;even Ton, the others, as they appear now, were at 5 or 6 Times as big, and mu&s;t in proportion; and therefore, I mu&s;t think their Judgment much nearer the Ca&s;e who judge the upright Stones at 16 Ton, or thereabouts, &s;uppo&s;ing them to &s;tand a great way into the Earth, as 'tis not doubted but they do; and the Coronets, or cro&s;s Stones, at about two Ton, which is very large too, and as much as their Bulk can be thought to allow.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we mu&s;t take them as our Ance&s;tors have done; Namely, for an Erection, or Building &s;o antient, that no Hi&s;tory has handed down to us the Original, as we find it then uncertain, we mu&s;t leave it &s;o: 'Tis indeed a Reve|rend peice of Antiquity, and 'tis a great lo&s;s that the true Hi&s;tory of it is not known; But &s;ince it is not, I think the making &s;o many Conjectures at the Reali|ty, when they know none can but gue&s;s at it, and above all the in&s;i&s;ting &s;o long, and warmly on their private Opinions, is
<PB REF="128" MS="Y">
amu&s;ing them&s;elves and us with a Doubt, which perhaps lies the deeper for their Search into it,</P>
<P>The Downs and Plains in this part of England being &s;o open, and the Surface &s;o little Subject to Alteration, there are more Remains of Antiquity to be &s;een upon them, than in other Places; for Ex|ample, I think they tell us there are three and fifty ancient Encampments, or For|tifications to be &s;een in this one County, &s;ome whereof are exceeding plain to be &s;een, &s;ome of one form, &s;ome of another; &s;ome of one Nation, &s;ome of another, Briti&s;h, Dani&s;h, Saxon, Roman, as at Ebb$down, Burywood, Oldburgh Hill, Cummerford, Roundway Down, St. Ann's Hill, Bratton Ca&s;tle, Clay Hill, Stourn|ton Park, Whitecole Hill, Battlebury, Scrathbury, Yanesbury, Frippsbury, Suth|bury Hill, Amesbury, Great Bodwyn, Ea&s;terley, Merdon, Aubery, Marten&s;cil Hill, Barbury Ca&s;tle, and many more.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Barrows&punc; as we all agree to call them, are very many in Number in this County, and very obvious, ha|ving &s;uffer'd very little Decay, the&s;e are large Hillocks of Earth ca&s;t up&punc; as the antients agree, by the Soldiers over the Bodies of their dead Comrades &s;lain in Battle; &s;everal Hundreds of the&s;e are to be &s;een, e&s;pecially in the North part of this County, about Marlbro' and the Downs, from thence to St. Ann's Hill, and even every way, the Downs are full of them.</P>
<P>I have done with Matters of Antiqui|ty for this County, unle&s;s you will ad|mit me to mention the famous Parlia|ment in the Reign of Henry II. held at Clarendon, where I am now writing, and another intended to be held there in Richard the 2d's Time, but prevented by the Barons, being then up in Arms again&s;t the King.</P>
<P>Near this Place at Farlo was the Birth-place of the late Sir Stephen Fox, and where the Town &s;haring in his good Fortune, &s;hews &s;everal Marks of his Bounty, as particularly, the Building a new Church from the Foundation, and getting an Act of Parliament pa&s;t, for making it Parochial, it being but a Chappel of Ea&s;e before to an adjoin|ing Pari&s;h: Al&s;o Sir Stephen Built and Endow'd an Alms-Hou&s;e here for &s;ix poor Women, with a Ma&s;ter and a Free-School; the Ma&s;ter is to be a Clergy|man, and to officiate in the Church, that is to &s;ay, is to have the Living, which including the School is very &s;uf|ficient.</P>
<P>I am now to pur&s;ue my fir&s;t De&s;ign, and &s;hall take the We&s;t part of Wil$&s;hi$e in my Return, where are &s;everal Things &s;till to be taken notice of, and &s;ome very well worth ou$ &s;tay. In the mean time I went on to Langbro' a fine Seat of my Lord Colerain, which is very well kept, tho' the Family it &s;eems is not much in this Country, having another E&s;tate, and Dwelling at Tottenham High-Cro&s;s near London.</P>
<P>From hence I my way to the Sea &s;ide I came to New Fore&s;t, of which I have &s;aid &s;omething already with Relation to the great Extent of Ground, which lies Wa&s;t, and in which there is &s;o a great a Quantity of large Timber, as I have &s;po|ken of already.</P>
<P>This wa&s;t and wild Part of the Coun|try was, as &s;ome Record, lay'd open, and wa&s;t for a Fore&s;t, and for Game, by that violent Tyrant William the Conqueror, and for which purpo&s;e he unpeopled the Country, pull'd down the Hou&s;es, and which was wor&s;e, the Churche&punc; of &s;e|veral Pari&s;hes or Towns, and of abun|dance of Villages, turning the poor Peo|ple out of their Habitations, and Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions. and laying all open for his Deer: The &s;ame Hi&s;tories likewi&s;e Re|cord that two of his Blood and Po&s;terity, and particularly his immediate Succe&s;&s;or William Ru&s;us lo&s;t their Lives in this Fore&s;t One (viz.) the &s;aid, William Ru&s;us being &s;hot with an Arrow directed at a Deer, which the King, and his Com|pany were Hunting, and the Arrow glancing on a Tree, chang'd his Cour&s;e and &s;truck the King full on the Brea&s;t, and kill'd him: This they relate as a ju&s;t Judgment of God on the cruel Deva&s;ta|tion made here by the Conqueror: Be

it &s;o or not, as Heaven plea&s;es; butt that the King was &s;o kill'd, is certain, and they &s;how the Tree, on which the Ar|row glanc'd to this Day; in King Chrles II. Time, it was ordered to be &s;urround|ed with a Pale, but as great part of the Paleing is down with Age; whether the Tree be really &s;o old, or not, is to me a great Que&s;tion; the Action being near 700 Year ago.</P>
<P>I cannot omit to mention here a Pro|po&s;al made a few Years ago to the late Lord Trea&s;urer, Godolphin, for Re peop|ling this Fore&s;t, which for &s;ome Rea&s;ons I can be more particular in, than any Man now left alive, becau&s;e I had the Honour to Draw up the Scheme, and ar|gue it before that Noble Lord, and &s;ome others who were principally concern'd at that time in bringing Over, or rather providing for when they were come Over, the poor Inhabitants of the P la|$inate; a Thing in it&s;elf Commendable, but as it was managed, made Scandalous to England, and Mi&s;erable to tho&s;e poor People.</P>
<P>Some Per&s;ons being ordered by that Noble Lord, above mention'd, to con&s;ider of Mea&s;ures, how the &s;aid poor People &s;hould be Provided for, and whether they could be provided for, or no, without Injury to the Publick. The an&s;wer was grounded upon this Maxim, that the Number of Inhabitants is the Wealth and Strength of a Kingdom, provided tho&s;e Inhabitants were &s;uch, as by hone&s;t In|du&s;try applied them&s;elves to live by their Labour, to what&s;oever Trades, or Em|ployments they were brought up. In the next Place it was inquir'd, what Employments tho&s;e poor People were brought up to? It was an&s;wer'd, there were Husbands, and Artificers of all Sorts, upon which the Propo&s;al was as follows.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>New Fore&s;t in Hamp&s;hire was &s;ignl'd out to be the Place.</HEAD>
<P>Here it was propos'd to draw a great Square-Line, containing four Thoun&s;and Acres of Land, marking out two lage High ways, or Roads thro&punc; the Center, cro&s;&s;ing both Ways, &s;o that there &s;hould be a Thou&s;and Acres in each Divi&s;ion, exclu&s;ive of the Land contained in the &s;aid cro&s;s Roads.</P>
<P>Then it was propo&s; d to &s;ingle out twenty Men, and their Families, who &s;hould be recommended as hone&s;t in|du&s;trious Men, expert in, or at lea&s;t ca|pable of being in&s;tructed in Husbandry, curing and cultivating of Land, breed|ing and feeding Cattle, and the like; to each of the&s;e &s;hould be parcell'd out in equal Di&s;tributions, two Hundred Acres of this Land, &s;o that the whole Four Thou&s;and Acres &s;hould be fully di&s;tri|buted to the &s;aid Twenty Families, for which they &s;hould have no no Rent to pay, and be liable to no Taxes, but &s;uch as provided for their own Sick or Poor, repairing their own Roads, and the like: This Exemption from Rent and Taxes, to continue for twenty Years, and then to pay each So l. a Year to the Queen; that is to &s;ay, to the Crown.</P>
<P>To each of the&s;e Families, who I would now call Farmers, it was propo&s;ed to advance 200 l. in ready Money, as a Stock to &s;et them to Work, to furni&s;h them with Cattle, Hor&s;es, Cows, Hogs, &amp;c. and to Hire and pay Labourers, to Enclo&s;e, Clear, and Cure the Land; which it would be &s;uppos'd the fir&s;t Year would not be &s;o much $o their Advantage as afterwards; allowing them Timber out of the Fore&s;t to build them&s;elves Hou&s;es, and Barns, Sheds, and Offices, as they &s;hould have Occa&s;ion; al&s;o for Carts, Waggons, Ploughs, Harrows, and the like nece&s;&s;ary Things, Care to be taken, that the Men and their Families, went to work forthwith according to the De|&s;ign.</P>
<P>Thus twenty Families would be im|mediately &s;upplyed, and provided for, for there would be no doubt, but the&s;e Families with &s;o much Land given them Gratis, and &s;o much Money to work with, would live very well; but what would this do for the Support of the re&s;t?
<PB REF="130" MS="Y">
who were &s;uppos'd to be to every 20 Farmers, forty or fifty Families of other People; &s;ome of one Trade, &s;ome of an|other, with Women and Children? to this it was an&s;wer'd, that the&s;e twenty Farmers would by the Con&s;equence of their own Settlements, provide for, and employ &s;uch a Proportion of others of their own People, That by thus provid|ing for twenty Families in a Place, the whole Number of Palatinates would have been provided for, had they been 20000 more in Number than they were, and that without being any Burthen upon, or Injury to the People of England; on the centrary, they would have been an Advantage, and an Addition of Wealth and Strength to the Nation, and to the Country in particular where they &s;hould be thus Seated: For Example:</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Land was mark'd out the Farmers put in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and the Money given them, they &s;hould be oblig'd to go to Work, in order to their Settlement; &s;uppo&s;e it then to be in the Spring of the Year, when &s;uch Work was mo&s;t proper; Fir&s;t all hands would be requir'd, to Fence, and Part off the Land, and clear&punc; it of the Timber, or Bu&s;hes, or what ever el&s;e was upon it, which requir'd to be remov'd: The fir&s;t Thing therefore which the Farmer would do, would be to &s;ingle out from the re&s;t of their Number, every one three Ser|vants, that is to &s;ay, two Men, and a Maid; le&s;s cou'd not an&s;wer the Prepa|rations they would be oblig'd to make, and yet work hard them&s;elves al&s;o; by the help of the&s;e, they would with good Management &s;oon get &s;o much of their Land Cur'd, Fenc'd oft, Plow'd, and Sow'd, as &s;hould yield them a &s;ufficiency of Corn and Kitchin Stuff, the very fir&s;t Year, both for Hor&s;e-meat, Hog-meat, Food for the Family, and &s;ome to carry to Market too, by which to bring in Money to go farther on, as above.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t Entrance&punc; they were to have the Tents allow'd them to live in, which they then had from the Tower; but as &s;oon as Lei&s;ure, and Conveniences admitted, every Farmer was oblig'd to begin to Build him a Farm-hou&s;e, which he would do gradually, &s;ome and &s;ome, as he could &s;pare Time from his other Works, and Money from his little Stock.</P>
<P>In order to furni&s;h him&s;elf with Carts&punc; Waggons, Plows, Harrows, Wheel-Bar|rows, Hurdles, and all &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary U|ten&s;ils of Husbandry; there would be an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of Wheelwrights, or Cartwrights, one at la&s;t to each Di|vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus by the Way, there would be Em|ploy'd three Servants to each Farmer, that makes &s;ixty Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Four Families of Wheelwrights, one to each Divi&s;ion; which, &s;uppo&s;e five in a Family, makes 20 Per&s;ons; &s;uppo&s;e four Head Carpenters, with each three Men, and as at fir&s;t all would be building toge|ther, they would to every Hou&s;e build|ing have at lea&s;t one Labourer, four Fa|milies of Carpenters five to each Families of Carpenters, five to each Family, and three Servants, is thirty two Per&s;ons, one Labourer to each Hou&s;e building, is twenty Per&s;ons more.</P>
<P>Thus here would be Nece&s;&s;arily brought together in the very fir&s;t of the Work 132 Per&s;ons, be&s;ides the head Farmers, who at five, al&s;o to each Family are #an Hundred more, in all two Hundred Thirty two.</P>
<P>For the nece&s;&s;ary Supply of the&s;e with Provi&s;ions, Cloaths, Hou&s;hold Stuff, &amp;$. for all &s;hould be done among them&s;elves; fir&s;t, they mu&s;t have at lea&s;t four Butchers with their Families; twenty Per&s;ons, four Shoemakers with their Families, and each Shoemaker two Journeymen for every Trade; would Encrea&s;e the Num|ber of Cu&s;tomers to every Trade: This is twenty eight Per&s;ons more.</P>
<P>They would then require a Hat$aler&punc; a Glover, at lea&s;t two Ropemakers, four Taylors, three Weavers of Woollen, and three Weavers of Linnen, two Basket|makers&punc; two common Brewers, ten or twelve Shop-keepers to furni&s;h Chand|lery and Grocery Wares; and as many for Drapery and Mercery, over and a|bove what they could Work, this makes
<PB REF="131" MS="Y">
two and forty Families more, each at five in a Family, which is two hundred and ten Per&s;ons; all the labouring Part of the&s;e mu&s;t have at lea&s;t two Servants, the Brewers more, which I ca&s;t up at forty more.</P>
<P>Add to the&s;e two Mini&s;ters, one Clerk, one Sexton, or Grave-digger with their Families, two Phy&s;icians, three Apothe|caries, two Surgeons, le&s;s there could not be, only that for the beginning it might be &s;aid the Phy&s;icians &s;hould be Su geons, and I take them &s;o; this is forty five Per&s;ons, be&s;ides Servants; &s;o that in &s;hort, to omit many Trade&s;men more who would be wanted among them, there would nece&s;&s;arily, and voluntarily $ollow, to the&s;e twenty Families of Far|mers at lea&s;t &s;ix hundred more of their own People.</P>
<P>It is no difficult thing to &s;hew that the ready Money of 4000 l. which the Go|vernment was to advance to tho&s;e twenty Farmers, would Employ and Pay, and con&s;equently Subli&s;t all the&s;e numerous Dependants, in the Works which mu&s;t $everally be done for them, for the fir&s;t Year; after which the Farmers would begin to receive their own Money back again; for all the&s;e Trade&s;men mu&s;t $ome to their own Market to buy Corn, $le&s;h, Milk, Butter, Chee&s;e, Bacon, &amp;c. which after the fir&s;t Year the Farmers having no Rent to pay, would have to pare &s;ufficiently, and &s;o take back their own Money with Advantage; I need $ot go on to mention. how by con&s;e|quence Provi&s;ions encrea&s;ing, and Money $irculating, this Town &s;hould Encrea&s;e in very little Time.</P>
<P>It was Propos'd al&s;o that for the En|couragement of all the Handicra&s;t&s;men, $nd Labouring Poor, who either as Ser|vants, or as Labourers for Day work, $&s;&s;i&s;ted the Farmers or other Trade&s;men, $hey &s;hould have every Man three Acres $f Ground given them, with leave to $uild Cottages upon the &s;ame, the Al|lotments to be upon the Wa&s;te, at the $nd of the Cro&s;s Roads where they en|$red the Town.</P>
<P>In the Center of the Square was laid out a Circle of twelve Acres of Ground, to be ca&s;t into Streets for Inhabitants to build on, as their Ability would permit; all that would Build to have Ground gratis for twenty Years, Timber out of the Fore&s;t, and convenient Yards, Gardens and Orchards allotted to every Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Great Streets near where they Cro&s;s each other, was to be Built a hand|&s;ome Market-ho&s;e, with a Town-Hall for Pari&s;h or Corporation Bu&s;ine&s;s, doing Ju&s;tice and the like; al&s;o Shambles, and in a hand&s;ome Part of the Ground men|tion'd to be laid out for Streets, as near the Center as might be, was to be Ground laid $ut for the building a Church, which every Man &s;hould either Contri|bute to the Building of in Money, or give every tenth Day of his Time to a&s;&s;i&s;t in Labouring at the Building.</P>
<P>I have omitted many Trade&s;men, who would be wanted here, and would find a good Livel hood among their Coun|try Folks; only to get accidental Work, as Daymen, or Labourers; of which $span$ Town would con&s;tantly Employ many, as al&s;o poor Women for A&s;&s;i&s;tance in Families, &s;uch as Midwives Nur&s;es, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Adjacent to to the Town was to be a certain Quantity of Common Land, for the Benefit of the Cottages; that the Poor might have a few Sheep, or Cows as their Circum&s;tances requir'd, and this to be appointed at the &s;everal Ends of the Town.</P>
<P>There was a Calculation made of what Encrea&s;e here would be, both of Wealth and People in twenty Years in this Town, what a va&s;t Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions they would cau&s;e, more than the four thou&s;and Acres of Land given them would produce; by which Con|&s;umption, and encrea&s;e &s;o much Advan|tage would accrue to the publick Stock, and &s;o many Subjects be added to the many Thou&s;ands of Great Britain; who in the next Age would be all True born Engli&s;h-men, and forget both the Lan|guage, and Nation from whence they
<PB REF="132" MS="Y">
came; and it was in order to this that two Mini&s;ters were appointed, one of which &s;hould officiate in Engli&s;h, and the other in High Dutch; and withal to have them oblig'd by a Law to Teach all their Children both to Speak, Read and Write the Engli&s;h Language.</P>
<P>Upon their Encrea&s;e they would al&s;o want Barbers, and Gla&s;iers, Painters al&s;o and Plumbers; a Windmill or two, and the Mille$s and their Families, a Fulling|mill, and a Cloth-Worker; as al&s;o a Ma&s;ter Clothier, or two, for making a Manufacture among them for their own Wear, and for employing the Women and Children; a Dyer or two, for Dy|ing their Manufactures; and, which a|bove all, is not to be omitted, four Fa|milies at lea&s;t of Smiths with every one two Servants; con&s;idering that be&s;ides all the Family work, which continually employs a Smith, all the Shoeing of Hor&s;es, aa the iron-work of Plows, Carts, Waggons, Harrows, &amp;c. mu&s;t be wrought by them.</P>
<P>There was no Allowance made for Inns, and Alehou&s;es, &s;eeing it would be frequent that tho&s;e who kept Publick Hou&s;es of any &s;ort would likewi&s;e have &s;ome other Employment to carry on.</P>
<P>This was the Scheme for &s;ettling the Palatinates, by which Means twenty Fa|milies of Farmers, hand&s;omely &s;et up, &s;upported, would lay a Foundation, as I have &s;aid, for &s;ix or &s;even hundred of the re&s;t of their People; and as the Land in New Fore&s;t is undoubtedly good, and capable of Improvement by &s;uch Cul|tivation, &s;o other Wa&s;tes in England are to be found as fruitful as that; and twenty &s;uch Villages might have been erected, the poor Strangers maintained, and the Nation evidently be better'd by it, as to the Money to be advanc'd, which in the Ca&s;e of twenty &s;uch Settle|ments, at 4000 l. each, would be 80000 l. two Things were an&s;wer'd to it</P>
<P N="1">1. That the annual Rent to be receiv'd for all tho&s;e Lands after twenty Years, would abundantly pay the Publick for the fir&s;t Disbur&s;&s;es on the S$deme above, that Rent being then to amount to 40000 l per Ann.</P>
<P N="2">2. More Money than would have don$ thi, was expended, or r ther thro$$ away upon them here, to keep them it &s;u&s;p n&s;e and afterwards &s;tar$e them; &s;end|ing th m a begging all over the Nation and &s;hipping them off to peri&s;h in othe$ Countries: Where the Mi&s;take lay, i$ none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire.</P>
<P>I re&s;erv'd this Account for this place, becau&s;e I pa&s;s'd in this Journey over the very Spot where the De&s;ign was laid out; namely, near Lindhur&s;t, in the Ro d from Rum&s;ey to Lunington, whether I now directed my Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Limington is a little, but populous Se$ Port, &s;tanding oppo&s;ite to the I&s;le of Wight, in the narrow Part of the Streigh$, which Ships &s;ometimes pa&s;s thro' in fair Weather, call'd the Needles; and right again&s;t an ancient Town of that I&s;land call'd yar|mouth, and which, in Di&s;tinction from the great Town of Yarmouth in Norfolk, is c ll'd South Y rm uth. This Town of Limington is chiefly noted for making fine Salt, which is indeed exceilent good; and from whence all South Parts of Eng|land are &s;upply'd, as well by Water as by Land Carriage; and &s;ometimes, tho' not often, they &s;e d Salt to London, when contrary Winds having kept the Northern Fleets back, the Price at Lon|don has been very high; but this is very &s;eldom and uncertain. Limingt n &s;ends two Members to Parliament, and this and her Salt Trade is all I can to her, for tho' &s;he is very well &s;ituated, as to the Convenience of Shipping, I do not find they have any Foreign Commerce; except it be what we Smuggling, a d Rogueing; which, I may &s;ay, is the reigning Commerce of all this Part of th$ Engli&s;h Co &s;t, from the Mouth of the Thames to the Land's End of Com|wall.</P>
<P>From hence there are but few Towns on the S a Coa&s;t We&s;t, tho' there are &s;everal con&s;iderable Rivers empty them|&s;elves into the Sea, nor are there any Harbours, or Sea Ports o$ any Note, ex|cept Pool: As for Chri&s;t Church, tho' it

&s;tands at the Mouth of the Avon, which, as I have &s;aid, comes down from Salis|bury, and brings with it all the Waters of the South and Ea&s;t Parts of Wilt&s;hire; and receives al&s;o the Stour and Piddle, two Dor&s;et&s;hire Rivers, which bring with them all the Waters of the North Part of Dor&s;et&s;hire; yet it is a very in|con&s;iderable poor place, &s;earce worth &s;eeing, and le&s;s worth mentioning in this Account; only, that it &s;ends two Members to Parliament, which many Poor Towns in this part of England do, as well as that.</P>
<P>From hence I &s;tept into the Coun|try North We&s;t, to &s;ee the ancient Town of Wimburn, or Wimburnmin|&s;ter: There I found nothing remarkable, but the Church, which is indeed a very great one, ancient, and yet very well built, with a very firm &s;trong &s;quare Tower high; but was, without doubt, much finer, when on the Top of it, &s;tood a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Spire finer and taller, if Fame lies not, than that at Salisbury, and, by its Situation, in a planer, flatter Country, vi&s;ible, no que&s;|tion, much farther: But this mo&s;t beau|tiful Ornament was blown down by a &s;udden Tempe&s;t of Wind, as they tell us, in the Year 1622.</P>
<P>The Church remains a venerable Piece of Antiquity, and has in it the Remains of a Place, much more in Re|que&s;t than it is now; for here are the Monuments of &s;everal noble Families; and in particular of one King, viz King Etheldred, who was &s;lain in Battle by the Danes: He was a Prince fam'd for Piety and Religion, and, according to the Zeal of the&s;e Times, was e&s;teem'd as a M$$tyr; becau&s;e venturing his Life again&s;t the Danes, who were Heathens, he died &s;ighting for his Religion and his Country. The In&s;cription upon his Grave is pre&s;erv'd, and has been care fully repair d, &s;o as to be ea&s;ily read, and is as follows:</P>
<P>In hoe loco quie&s;$it Corpus S. Ethel|dredi, Regis We&s;t Saxonum, Marryris, qui Anno Dom&punc; DCCCLXXII. xxiii. Aprilis per Manos Danorum Paga no|rum Occubuit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>In Engli&s;h thus:</HEAD>
<P>Here re&s;ts the Body of Holy Ethel|dred, King of the We&s;t Saxons, and Martyr, who fell in by the Hands of the Pagan Danes, in the Year of our Lord 872, the 23d of April.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o the Monuments of the great Marchione&s;s of Exeter, Mother of Edward Courtney, Earl of Devon&s;hire, and la&s;t of the Family of Courtneys who enjoy'd that Honour; as al&s;o of John de Beaufort, Duke of Somer&s;et, and his Wife, Grandmother of K. Henry VII. by her Daughter Margaret Counte&s;s of Richmond.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Lady I mention becau&s;e &s;he was Foundre&s;s of a very fine Free School, which has &s;ince been enlarg'd, and had a new Benefactre&s;s in Queen Elizabeth, who has enlarg'd the Stipend, and an|nex'd it to Foundation: The famous Car|dinal Pool was Dean of this Church be|fore his Exaltation.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this of the Church, I have &s;aid all that is worth naming of the Town; except that the Inhabitants, who are many, and poor, are chiefly main|tain'd by the Manufacture of knitting Stockings, which employs great Part indeed of the County of Dor&s;et of which this is the fir&s;t Town Ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>South of this Town, over a Sandy wild and barren Country, we came to Pool, a con&s;iderable Sea Port, and indeed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in all this part of England; for here I found &s;ome Ships, &s;ome Merchants, and &s;ome Trade; e&s;|pecially, here were a good Number of Ships fitted out every Year to the Newfoundland Fi&s;hing, in which the Pool Men were &s;aid to have been par|ticularly &s;ucce&s;sful for many Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Town &s;i$s in the Bottom of a great Bay, or Inlet of the Se$, which entring at one narrow Mouth opens $o a very great Shoar of this Town; it runs al&s;o We&s;t up almo&s;t to the Town of War$ham, a little below which it re|ceives
<PB REF="136" MS="Y">
the Rivers Froom and Piddle, the two principle Rivers of the County.</P>
<P>This Place is famous for the be&s;t, and bige&s;t Oy&s;ters in all this Part of England, which the People of Pool pretend to be famous for pickling, and they are Bar|rell'd up here, and &s;ent not only to Lon|don, but to the We&s;t Indies, and to Spain, and Italy, and other Parts 'Tis ob&s;erv'd more Pearl are found in the Pool Oy&s;ters, and larger than in any other Oy&s;ters a|bout England.</P>
<P>As the Entrance into this large Bay is Narrow, &s;o it is made narrower by an I&s;land, call'd Brank&s;ey, which lying in the very Mouth of the Pa&s;&s;age, divides it into two, and where there is an old Ca&s;tle, call'd Brank&s;ey Ca&s;tle built to defend the Entrance, and this Strength was very great advantage to the Trade of this Port, in the time of the late War with France.</P>
<P>Wareham is a neat Town, and full of People, having a &s;hare of Trade with Fool it &s;elf it &s;ho$'s the Ruins of a large Town, and 'tis apparent has had eight Churches, of which they have three re|maining.</P>
<P>South of Wareham, and between the Bay I have mention'd and the Sea, lyes a larke Tract of Land, which being &s;ur|rounded by the Sea, except on one Side is call'd an I&s;land, tho' it is really what &s;hould be called a Penin&s;ula; this Tract of Land is better inhabited than the Sea Coa&s;t of this We&s;t End of Dor&s;et&s;hire generally is, and the Manufactue of Stock|ings is cartyed on there al&s;o; it is called the I&s;le of Purbeck, and has in the Mid|dle of it a large Market-Town, called Corf, and from the famous Ca&s;tle there. The $hole Town is now call'd Corf-Ca&s;tle, it is a Corporation, &s;ending Members to Parliaments.</P>
<P>This part of the Country is eminent for va&s;t Quareys of Stone, which is cut out Flat, and us'd in London in great Quantities for Paving Court-Yards, Al|leys, Avenues to Hou&s;es, Kitchins, Foot|ways on the Sides of the High Streets, and the like; and is very profitable to the Place, as al&s;o in the Numbe$ of Shipping employed in bringing it to London. There are al&s;o &s;everal Rocks of very good Marble, only that the Veins in the Stone are not Black and White, as the Italian, but Grey, Red, and other Colours.</P>
<P>From Hence to Weymouth, which is&mdash;Miles we Rod in view of the Sea; the Country is open, and in &s;ome re&s;pects plea&s;ant, but not like the Northern Parts of the County, which are all fine Carpet Ground, &s;oft as Velvet, and the Herbage, &s;weet as Garden Herbs, which makes their Sheep be the be&s;t in England, if not in the World, and their Wool fine to an extrem.</P>
<P>I cannot omit here a &s;mall Adventure, which was very &s;urprizing to me on this Journey; pa&s;&s;ing this plain Country, we came to an open Peice of Ground where a Neighbouring Gentleman had at a great Expence laid out a proper peice of Land for a Decoy, or Du$k-coy, as &s;ome call it; the Works were but newly done, the Planting young the Ponds very large, and well made; but the proper Places for &s;helter of the Fowl not cover'd, the Trees not being grown, and Men were &s;till at work improving, and enlarging, and planting on the adjoyning Heath, or Common. Near the Decoy Keeper's Hou&s;e, were &s;ome Places where y $$g Decoy-Ducks were hatch'd, or $word$ wi&s;e kept to fit them for their Work&punc; To pre&s;erve them from Vermin, Pole|cats, Kites, and &s;uch like; they had &s;et Traps, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es, and a Gibbet by it, where abundance of &s;uch Creatures as were taken were hang d up for &s;how.</P>
<P>While the Decoy Man was bu&s;y &s;how|ing the New works, he was alarm'd with a great Cry about this Hou&s;e for Help, help, and away he run, like the Wind, gue&s;&s;ing, as we puppos'd that &s;omething was catched in the Trap.</P>
<P>It was a good big Boy about 13 or 1$ Year old, that cry'd out, for coming to
<PB REF="137" MS="Y">
the Place, he found a great Fowl catch'd by the Leg in the Trap, which yet was &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o outrageous, that the Boy going too near him, he flew at him, and frighted him, bit him, and beat him with his Wings, for he was too &s;trong for the Boy; as the Ma&s;ter ran from the De|coy, &s;o another Man-Servant run from the Hou&s;e, and finding a &s;t$ange Crea|ture fa&s;t in the Trap, not knowing what it was, laid at him with a great Stick; the Creature fought him a good while, but at length he &s;truck him an un|lucky Blow, which quieted him; after this we all came up to &s;ee what was the matter, and found a mon&s;truous Eagle caught by the Leg in the Trap, and kill'd by the Fellow's Cudgel, as above.</P>
<P>When the Ma&s;ter came to know what it was, and that his Man had kill'd it, $e was ready to kill the Fellow for his pains, for it was a noble Creature indeed, and would have been worth a great deal to the Man to have it &s;hown about the Country, or to have &s;old to any Gentle|man curious in &s;uch Things; but the Eagle was dead, and there we left it; 'Tis probable this Eagle had flown over the Sea from France, either there, or at the I&s;le of Weight, where the Channel is not &s;o wide; for we do not find that any Eagle are known to breed in tho&s;e Parts of Britain.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd up to Dorche&s;+ter, the County Town, tho' not the la ge&s;t Town in the County; Dorche&s;ter is in|deed a plea&s;ant agreeable Town to live in, and where I thought the People &s;eem|ed le&s;s divided into Factions and Parties, than in other Places; for though there are Divi&s;ions and the People are not all of one Mind, either as to Religion, or Po|liticks, yet they did not &s;eem to &s;eparate with &s;o much Animo&s;ity as in other Places: Here I &s;aw the Church of England Cler|gymen, and the Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter, or P$e$che$ drinking Tea together, and Con|ver&s;ing with Civility and good Neigh|bourhood, like Catholick Chri&s;tians, and Men of a Catholick, and exten&s;ive Cha|rity: The Town is populous, tho' not large, the Streets broad, but the Build|ings old, and low; however, there is good Company and a good deal of it; and a Man that coveted a retreat in this World might as agreeably, &s;pend his time, and as well in Dorche&s;ter, as in any Town $ know in England.</P>
<P>The Downs round this Town are ex|ceeding plea&s;ant, and come up on every Side, even to the very Streets end; and here it was that they told me, that there were 600 thou&s;and Sheep fed on the Downs, within &s;ix Miles of the Town; that is, &s;ix Miles every way, whi h is Twelve Miles in Circumference. This I &s;ay I was told, I do not affirm it to be true; but when I viewed the Country. I confe&s;s I could not but in$line to be|lieve it.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable of the&s;e Sheep, that they are exceeding Fruitful and the Ews generally b inging two Lambs, and they are for that Rea&s;on bought by all the Far|mers th$o' the Ea&s;t Part of England, who come to Burford Fair in this Country to buy them, and carry them into Kent and Surry Ea&s;tward and into Buckingham|&s;hire, and Bedford&s;hire, and Oxford&s;hire North even our Ban&s;ted Downs in Surrey, &s;o fam'd for good Mutton, is &s;upply'd from this Place: The Gra&s;s, or Herbage of the&s;e Downs is full of the &s;weere&s;t, and the mo&s;t Aromatick Plants, &s;uch as Nouri&s;h the Sheep to a &s;trange degree, and the Sheeps Dung again Nouri&s;hes that Herbage to a &s;trange degree; &s;o that the Valleys are render'd extreamly Fruit|ful, by the wa&s;hing of the Water in ha&s;ty Showers from off the&s;e Hills.</P>
<P>An eminent In&s;tance of this is &s;een at Amesbury in Wilt&s;hire, the next County to this, for it is the &s;ame thing in pro|portion over this whole County: I was told that at this Town there was a Mea|dow on the Bank of the River Avon&punc; which $uns thence to Salisbury, which was let for 12 l a Year per Acre for the Gra&s;s only: This I enquir'd particularly after, at the Place, and was a&s;&s;urd by the Inhabitants as one Man, that the Fact was true, and was &s;hew'd the Meadows; the Gra&s;s which gre$ on them was &s;uch as grew to the length of Ten or Twelve
<PB REF="138" MS="Y">
Foot, ri&s;ing to a good Height, and then taking Root again, and was of &s;o rich a Nature as to an&s;wer very well &s;uch an extravagant Rent.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on they gave for this, was the extraordinary richne&s;s of the &s;oil, made &s;o, as above, by the falling, or wa&s;hings of the Rains from the Hills adjacent, by which tho' no other Land thereabouts had no &s;uch a kind of Gra&s;s, yet all other Meadows, and low Grounds of the Valley were extreamly rich in Proportion.</P>
<P>There are abundance of good Families, and of very antient Lines of the Neigh|bourhood of this Town of Dorche&s;ter, as the Napiers, the Courtneys, S range|ways, Seymours, Banks, Tregonills, Se|denhams, and many others &s;ome of which have very great E&s;tates in the County, and in particular Col. Strange|ways, Napier, and Courtney. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is Ma&s;ter of the famous Swan|nery, or Nur&s;ery of Swans, the like of which I believe is not in Europe; I wonder any Man &s;hould pretend to Tra|vel over this Country, and pa&s;s by it too, and then write his Account, and take take no Notice of it.</P>
<P>From Dorche&s;ter it is &s;ix Miles to the Sea &s;ide South, and the Ocean in view almo&s;t all the Way: The fir&s;t Town you come to is Weymouth, or Weymouth and Melcomb, two Towns lying at the Mouth of a little Rivulet, which they call the Wey, buti&s;carce claims the Name of a River; however, the Entrance makes a very good, tho' &s;mall Harbour, and they are join'd by a wooden Bridges &s;o that nothing but the Harbour parts them; yet they are &s;eperate Corporati|ons, and cho&s;e each of them two Mem|bers of Parliament, ju&s;t as London and Southwark.</P>
<P>Weymouth is a &s;weet, clean, agree|able Town, con&s;idering its low Situa|tion, and clo&s;e to the Sea; 'tis well built, and has a great many good &s;ub|&s;tantial Merchants in it; who drive a con&s;iderable Trade, and have a good Number of Ships belonging to the Town: They carry on now, in Time of Peace, a Trade with France; but be|&s;ides this, they trade al&s;o to Portugal, Spain, Newfoundland, and Virginia $ and they have a large Corre&s;pondence al&s;o up in the Country for the Con|&s;umption of their Returns; e&s;pecially the Wine Trade, and the Newfoundland Trade are con&s;iderable here.</P>
<P>Without the Harbour is an old Ca|&s;tle, call'd Sandfoot Ca&s;tle, and over|again&s;t them, where there is a good Road for Ships to put in on Occa&s;ions of bad Weather, is Portland Ca&s;tle and the Road is call'd Portland Road: While $ was here once, there came a Merchant Ship into that Road, call'd Portland Road under a very hard S$orm of Wind; &s;he was homeward bound from Oporto for London, laden with Wines, and as &s;he came in, &s;he made Signals of Di&s;tre&s;s to the Town, firing Guns for Help, and the like, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch C$&s;e;$ it was in the Dark of the Night that the Ship came in and, by the Help of her own Pilot, found her Way into the Road, where &s;he came to an An|chor, but as I &s;ay, fir'd Guns for Help.</P>
<P>The venterous Weymouth-Men went off, even before it was light, with two Boats to &s;ee who &s;he was, and what Condition &s;he was in, and found &s;he was come to an Anchor and had &s;truck her Top Ma&s;ts; but $hat &s;he had been in bad Weather, had lo&s;t an Anchor and Cable before, and had but one Cabero tru&s;t to, which did hold her, but was weak; and as the Storm continued to blow, they expected every Hour to go on Shore, and &s;plit to pieces.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Weymouth Boats came back with &s;uch Diligence, that, in le&s;s than three Hours, they were on board them again with an Anchor and Cable, which they immediately bent in its place, and let go to a&s;&s;i&s;t the other, and thereby &s;ecur'd the Ship: 'Tie true, that they took a good Price of the Ma&s;ter for the Help they gave him, for they made him draw a Bill on his Owners at London for 12 l. for the U&s;e of the An|chor, Cable, and Boat, be&s;ides &s;ome
<PB REF="139">
Gratuities to the Men: But they &s;av'd&punc; $he Ship and Cargo by it, and in three or four Days the Weather was calm, and $e proceeded on his Voyage, returning the Anchor and Cable again; &s;o that, upon the whole, it was not &s;o extrava|gant at fir&s;t as I thought it to be.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of Portland, on which the Ca&s;tle I mention'd &s;tands, lies right a|gain&s;t this Port of Weymouth: Hence it $s, that our be&s;t and white&s;t free Store comes, with which the Cathed$al of St. Pauls, the Monument, and all the pub|lick Edifices in the City of London, are chiefly built; and 'tis wonde ful, and well worth the Ob&s;ervation of a Travel$er to &s;ee the Quarries in the Rocks, from whence they are cut out, what Stones, and of what prodigious a Size are cut out there</P>
<P>The I&s;land is indeed little more than $o$e continued Rock of free Stone, and the height of the Land is &s;uch, that from this I&s;land they &s;ee, in clear Weather, above half over the Channel to France, tho' the Channel here is very broad; the Sea off of this I&s;land e&s;pecially to the We&s;t of it, is counted the mo&s;t dangerous Part of the Briti&s;h Channel: Due South, there is almo&s;t a continued Di&s;turbance in the Waters, by Rea&s;on of what they call two Tides meeting, which I take to be no more than the Setts of the Currents from the French Coa&s;t, and from the Engli&s;h Shore meeting: This they call Portland Race; and &s;everal Ships, not aware of the&s;e Currents, have been em|bay'd to the We&s;t of Portland, and been driven on Shore on the Breach, (of which I &s;hall &s;peak pre&s;ently) and there lo&s;t.</P>
<P>To prevent this Danger, and guide the Mariner in the&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, they have, within the&s;e few Months, &s;et up two $ight-Hou&s;es on the two points of that $&s;land; and they had not been many Months &s;et up, with the Directions given to the Publick for their Bearings, but we found three outward-bound Ea&s;t-India Ships which were in Di&s;tre&s;s in the Night, in a hard extream Gale of Wind, were &s;o directed by tho&s;e Lights, that they avoided going on Shore by it, which, if the Lights had no$ been there, would in|evitably happen'd to their De&s;truction.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, tho' &s;eemingly mi&s;erable, and thinly inhabited, yet the Inhabitants being almo&s;t all Stone-cutters, we found there was no very poor People among them; and when they collected Money for the rebuilding St. Paul's, they got more in this i&s;land than in the great Town of Dorche&s;ter, as we were told.</P>
<P>Tho' Portland &s;tands a League off from the main Land of Britain, yet it is almo&s;t joyn'd by a prodigous Riffe of Beach, that is to &s;ay, of &s;mall Stone$ ca&s;t up by the Sea, which runs from the I&s;land &s;o near the Shore of England, that $hey fer|ry over with a Bo$t and a Rope, the Water not being above half a Stones throw over; and the &s;aid Riffe of Beach ending, as it we e, at that Inlet of Water, turns away We&s;t and runs paralled with the Sho e quite to Abbotsbury, which is a Town about &s;even Miles beyond Wey|mouth.</P>
<P>I name this for two Rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, to explain again what I &s;aid before, of Ships being embay'd and lo&s;t here. This is when Ships coming from the We&s;tward omit to k ep a good O$$ing, or are t$k n &s;hort by $ ntrar&punc; Winds, $nd c$n$ot Wea|ther the high Land of Portland, but are driven between Portland and the main Land; if th$y $m come to Anch$r, $nd ride it $ut, w$ll and good and if no$, they run $n Shore on that va&s;t Beach, a d are lo&s;t without $word$.</P>
<P>On the I$&s;ide $f this Be$$h, $$d between it, and the Land, there is, a$$ have &s;aid, an Inlet of Water, whi h the$ $$$ry over, as above, to pa&s;$ an$ repa&s;s to a$d from Portl$n$: This Inl$t op$ns at abou two Miles W &s;t, and $rows very b o$d, a$d $akes a kind of L$ke within the Land $f a and a half broad, and near three Mile in length, the Breadth un$qual. At Miles the farth$&s;t End We&s;t of this Water is a large Du$k-co, and the Verge of the W$|ter well gr$wn with Wood, and proper Gr$ves of Tr$es for Cover for the Foul; in the open L ke, o$ bro$d Part, is a con|tinual
<PB REF="140" MS="Y">
A&s;&s;embly of Swans: Here they live, feed and breed, and the Number of them is &s;uch, that, I believe, I did not &s;ee &s;o few as 7 or 8000. Here they are protected, and here they breed in abundance; we &s;aw &s;everal of them upon the Wing, very high in the Air, whence we &s;uppo&s;ed, that they flew over the Riffe of Beach, which parts the Lake from the Sea to feed on the Shores as they thought &s;it, and &s;o came home again at their Lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>From this Duck-coy We&s;t, the Lake narrows, and at la&s;t almo&s;t clo&s;es, till the Beach joyns the Shore; and &s;o Portland may be &s;aid not be an I&s;land, but part of the Continent; and now we came to Abbotsbury, a Town anciently famous for a great Mona&s;tery, and now eminent for nothing but its Ruins.</P>
<P>From hence we went on to Brid|port, a pretty large Corporation Town on the Sea Shore, tho' without a Har|bour: Here we &s;aw Boats all the way on the Shore fi&s;hing for Mackerell, which they take in the ea$$e&s;t Manner imagina|ble; for they fix one End of the Net to a Pole, &s;et deep into the Sand, then the Net being in a Boat, they row right out into the Water &s;ome Length, then turn, and row parallel with the Shore, vering out the Net all the while, till they have let go all Net, except the Line at the End, and then the Boat rows on Shore, when the Men haling the Net to the Shore at both Ends, bring to Shore with it &s;uch Fi&s;h, as they &s;ur|rounded in the little Way they rowed; this, at that time, proved to be an in|credible Number, in&s;omuch, that the Men could hardly draw them on Shore: As &s;oon as the Boats had brought their Fi&s;h on Shore, we ob&s;erved a Guard, or Watch, placed on the Shore in &s;everal Places, who we found had their Eye not on the Fi&s;hermen, but on the Coun|try People, who came down to the Shore to buy their Fi&s;h; and very &s;harp we &s;ound they were; and &s;ome that came with &s;mall Carts were obliged to go back empty, without any Fi&s;h. When we came to enquire into the Particu|lars of this, we found, that the&s;e were Officers placed on the Shore by the Ju&s;|tices and Magi&s;trates of the Towns about, who were order'd to prevent the Coun|try Farmers buying the Mackerell to dung their Land with them, which was thought to be dangerous, as to infection: In &s;hort, &s;uch was the plenty of Fi&s;h that Year, that the Mackerell, the fine&s;t and large&s;t I ever &s;aw, were &s;old at the Sea &s;ide a hundred for a Penny.</P>
<P>From Bridport, a Town in which we &s;ee nothing remarkable, we came to Lime, the Town particularly made fa|mous by the landing the Duke of Mon|mouth, and his unfortunate Troop, in the Time of King James II. of which I need &s;ay nothing, the Hi&s;tory of it being &s;o recent in the Memory of &s;o many living.</P>
<P>This is a Town of good Figure, and has in it &s;everal eminent Merchants, who carry on a con&s;iderable Trade to France, Spain, Newfoundland, and the Streights; and tho' they have neither Creek or Bay, Road, or River, they have a good Harbour; but 'tis &s;uch a one as is not in all Britain be&s;ides, if there is &s;uch a one in any Part of the World.</P>
<P>It is a ma&s;&s;y Pile of Building, con&s;i&s;ting of high and thick Walls of Stone, rais'd, at fir&s;t, with all the Methods that Skill and Art could devi&s;e. but maintain'd now with very little Difficulty: The Walls are rais'd in the main Sea, at a good Di&s;tance from the Shore; it con|&s;i&s;ts of one main and &s;olid Wall of Stone, large enough for Carts and Carriages to pa&s;s on the Top, and to admit Hou&s;es and Warehou&s;es to be built on it; &s;o that it is broad as a Street; oppo&s;ite to this, but farther into the Sea, is another Wall of the &s;ame Workman&s;hip, which cro&s;&s;es the End of the fir&s;t Wall, and comes about with a Tail, parallel to the fir&s;t Wall.</P>
<P>Between the Point of the fir&s;t or main Wall, is the Entrance into the Port, and the &s;econd, or oppo&s;ite Wall, breaking the Violence of the Sea from the En|trance, the Ships go into the Ba&s;in, as
<PB REF="141" MS="Y">
$to a Peer, or Harbour, and ride there $ &s;ecure as in a Mill Pond, or as in a Wet $ock.</P>
<P>The Town's People have the Benefit $ this wonderful Harbour, and it is care|$lly kept in repair, as indeed it behoves $em to do; but they could give me no|$ing of the Hi&s;tory of it nor do they, I could perceive, know any thing of $e Original of it, or who built it; it $s lately almo&s;t beaten down by a Storm, $t is repaired again.</P>
<P>This Work is call'd the Cobb: The $&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers have a Lodge and $arehou&s;e upon it, and there were &s;e|$al Ships of very good Force, and rich Value, in the Ba&s;in of it when I was $re: It might be &s;trengthen'd with a $t, and the Walls them&s;elves are firm $ugh to carry what Guns they plea&s;e $lant upon it; but they did not &s;eem $hink it needful; and as the Shore is $venient for Batteries, they have &s;ome $s planted in proper Places, both for Defence of the Cobb, and the $own $.</P>
<P>This Town is under the Government $ Mayor and Aldermen, and may pa&s;s a Place of Wealth, con&s;idering the $e&s;s of it: Here we found the Mer|$ts began to Trade in the Pitchard $ing, tho' not to &s;o con&s;iderable a De|$ as they do farther We&s;t, the Pitch|$ &s;eldom coming up &s;o high Ea&s;tward $ortland, and not very often &s;o high $ime.</P>
<P>$ was in &s;ight of the&s;e Hills that Queen $beth's Fleet, under the Command $e Lord Howard of Effingham, then $iral, began fir&s;t to engage in a Clo&s;e, re&s;olv'd fight with the invincible $i&s;h Amada, in 1588: Maintaining Fight, the Spaniards making Ea&s;t|$, till they came the Length of Port-Race, where they gave it over; the $ards having receiv'd con&s;iderable age&punc; and keeping then clo&s;er toge|$ Off of the &s;ame Place was a de&s;|$ Engagement in the Year 1672, be|$ the Engli&s;h and Dutch, in which $utch were wor&s;ted, and driven over to the Coa&s;t of France, and then glad to make home to refit and repair.</P>
<P>While we &s;tay'd here &s;ome Time view|ing this Town and Coa&s;t, we had Op|portunity to ob&s;erve the plea&s;ant Way of Conver&s;ation, as it is manag'd among the Gentlemen of this County, and their Familes, which are without Reflection &s;ome of the mo&s;t polite and well bred People in the I&s;le of Britain: As their Ho&s;pitality is very Great, and their Boun|ty to the Poor remarkable, &s;o their gener|ous friendly way of living with Vi&s;iting, and A&s;&s;ociating one with another is as hard to be de&s;crib'd, as it is really to be admir'd; they &s;eem to have a mutual Confidence in, and Friend&s;hip with one another, as if they were all Relations; nor did I ob&s;erve the &s;harping tricking Temper, which is too much crept in a|mong the Gameing and Hor&s;e-racing Gen|try in &s;ome Parts of England, to be &s;o much known among them, any other|wi&s;e than to be abhorr'd; and yet they &s;ometimes Play too, and make Matches, and Hor&s;e-races, as they &s;ee occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Ladies here do not want the help of A&s;&s;emblies to a&s;&s;i&s;t in Match-making; or Halfpay Officers to run away with their Daughters, which the Meetings, call'd A&s;&s;emblies in &s;ome other Parts of Eng|lang, are recommended for: Here's no Bury Fair, where the Women are &s;can|dalou&s;ly &s;aid to carry them&s;elves to Mar|ket, and where every Night they meet at the $lay, or at the A&s;&s;embly for In|treagne, and yet I ob&s;erv'd that the Wo|men do not &s;eem to &s;tick on Hand &s;o much in this Country, as in tho&s;e Coun|tries, where tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies are &s;o late|ly Set up; the Rea&s;on of which I can, not help &s;aying, if my Opinion may bear any weight, is, that the Dor&s;et&s;hire Ladies are equal in Beauty, and may be Superi|our in Reputation; In a Word, their Re|putation &s;eems here to better kept; guard|ed by better Conduct, and manag'd with more Prudence, and yet the Dor&s;et&s;hire Ladies, I a&s;&s;ure you, are not Nuns, they do not go vail'd about Streets, or hide them&s;elves when Vi&s;ited; but a general

f eedom of Conver&s;ation, agreeable, Mannerly, Kind, and Good runs thro' the whole body of Gentry of both Sexes, mix'd with the be&s;t of Behaviour, and yet govern'd by Prudence and Mode|&s;ty; &s;uch as I no where &s;ee better in all my Ob&s;ervation, thro' the whole I&s;le of Britain. In this little Interval al&s;o I vi&s;ited &s;ome of the bigge&s;t Towns in the North We&s;t Part of this Coun|try, as Blandford, a Town on the Ri|ver Stour in the Road between Salis|bury and Dorche&s;ter, a hand&s;ome well|built Town, but chiefly famous for ma|king the fine&s;t Bonelace in England, where they &s;hew'd me &s;ome &s;o exqui|&s;itely fine; as I think I never &s;aw bet|ter in Flanders, France or Italy, and which they &s;aid, they rated at above 30l. Sterling a Yard; but I &s;uppo&s;e there was not much of this to be had, but 'tis mo&s;t certain, that they make exceeding rich Lace in that County, &s;uch as no Part of England can equal.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Stourbride, vulgarly call d Sturbridge; the Town, and the Country round is employ'd in the Manufacture of S ockings, and which was once famous for making the fine&s;t, be&s;t, and highe&s;t Priz'd Knit Stockings in England; but that Trade now is much decay'd by the enerea&s;e of the Knitting Stocking Engine, or Frame, has de&s;troyed the hand Knitting-Trade for fine Stockings thro&punc; the whole King|dom, of which I &s;hall &s;peak more in its Place.</P>
<P>From hence I came to Shireburn, a large and populous Town, with one Collegiate, or Conventual Church, and may properly Claim to have more in it than any Town in Dor&s;et&s;hire, tho' it is neither the County Town, or does it &s;end Members to Parliament; the Church is &s;till a Reverend Pile, and &s;hews the Face of great Antiqui|ty. Here begins the Wilt&s;hire Medley $loathing; tho' this Town be in Dor&s;et|&s;hire; of which I &s;hall &s;peak at large in its Place, and therefore I omit any Di&s;|$our&s;e of it here.</P>
<P>Shaftsbury is al&s;o on the edge of this County, adjoining to Wilt&s;hire and D$ &s;et&s;hire, being 14 Mil s from Sa$s$ur over that fine Down or Carpet $word$ which they call particularl$, or $word$ Salisbury-Plain.

I cannot pa&s;s my Ob&s;ervation here, that when we are come this Length from Lon|don, the Dialect of the Engli&s;h Tongue, or the Country way of Expre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves is not ea&s;ily under&s;tond, it is &s;o $t&punc; angely altered; it is true, that it is &s;o in many Parts of England be&s;ides, but in none in &s;o gro&s;s a Degree as in this Part; This way of $oori&s;h Country Speech, as in Ireland, it is called the Brogue upon $he Tongue; &s;o here 'tis call'd Jouring, $nd 'tis certain, that tho&punc; the Tongue be $ll meer natural Engli&s;h yet tho&s;e that $re but a little acquainted with them, annot under&s;tand one half of what they $ay: It is not po&s;&s;ible to Explain this ful|$y by writing, becau&s;e the Difference is ot &s;o much in the Orthography of Words, $s in the Tone, and Diction; their abridg|$g the Speech, cham f r I am, chil for I $ill, don, for put on, and Doff, for put $word$ and the like.

<P>There liv'd a good &s;ub&s;tantial Family in the Town, not far from the Angel Inn, a well known Hou&s;e, which was then, and I &s;uppo&s;e is &s;till the chief Inn of the Town. This Family had a Dog&punc; which among his other good Qualities, for which they kept him (for he was a mo&s;t notorious Thie&s;f; but wi$hal, &s;o cunning a Dog, and managed him&s;elf &s;o warily, that he pre&s;erved a mighty good Repu|tation among the Neighbourhood; as the Family was well beloved in the Town, &s;o was the Dog; he was known to be a very u&s;eful Servant to them, e&s;pecially in the Night, when he was fierce as a Lion, but in the Day the gentle&s;t, lovinge&s;t Creature that could be, a$d as they &s;aid, all the Neighbours had a good Word for this Dog.</P>
<P>It happen'd that the good Wi&s;e, or Mi&s;tre&s;s at the Angel I$n, had frequently mi&s;&s;ed &s;everal peices of Meat out of the Pail, as they &s;ay, or Powdering-tub, as we call it; and that &s;ome very large peice; 'tis al&s;o to be ob&s;erv'd the Dog did not &s;tay to eat (what he took) upon the Spot, in which Ca&s;e &s;ome Peices, $r Bones, or Fragments might be left, and &s;o it might be di&s;cover'd to be a Dog; but he made cleaner Work, and when he fa&s;ten'd up|on a peice of Meat he was &s;ure to carry it quite a way&punc; to &s;uch Retreats as he knew he could be &s;afe in, and &s;o fea&s;t upon it at lei&s;ure.</P>

very large, and the Tide flows 10 or 12 $word$ at the Bridge. Here we had the $ver&s;ion of &s;eeing them catch Fi&s;h, $word$ the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Dogs.

<P>This Exce&s;&s;ive plenty of &s;o good Fi$h, and other Provi&s;ions being likewi&s;e very Cheap in proportion, makes the $own of Totne&s;s, a very good Place to live in, e&s;pecially for &s;uch as have large Families, and but &s;mall E&s;tates, and many &s;u$h are &s;aid to come into tho&s;e Parts on purpo&s;e for &s;aving Money, and to live in Pro|portion to their Income</P>
<P>From hence we ent &s;till South about &s;even Miles, (all in view of this River) to Dartmouth, a Town of note, &s;cated at the Mouth of the River Da$t, and where it enters into the Sea at a ve y narrow, but &s;afe Entrance. $he openi$g into Dartmouth Harbour is not B oad, but the Channel d$ep enough $or the b$gge&s;t Ship in the Royal N$$y; the Sides of the Entrance are $word$ the $word$ $$r|$owing of the P$&s;&s;age, $span$ &s;trong Fort without a Platform of Guns, which commands the $ort.</P>
<P>The narrow entrance is no$ mu$h a|bove Half a Mile, when it opens and make a Ba&s;in, or Harbour $ble to receive 500 Sail of Ships of any Size, and where they may ride with the greate&s;t S$f$ty, even as in a Mill pond, or Wet Do $word$ I had the Curio&s;ity here with the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a Merchant of the Town to go out to the Mouth of the Haven in a $oat to &s;ee the Entrance, and Ca&s;tle, or Fort that Commands it; and coming ba$k with the Tide of Flood I oberved &s;ome &s;mall Fi&s;h to skip, and play upon the Surface of the Water, upon whi h I asked my Friend what Fi&s;h they were; immedi|ately one of the Rowers or Seamen &s;t$rts up in the Boat, and throwin his Arms abroad, as if he had been be itch'd, $$ies out as loud as he could B$ul, a S$ool, a Scool. The Word was taken to the Sho$e as ha&s;t$ly as it would have been on $and if he h$d cry'd Fire, and by that time we rea$h'd the Keys, the Town was all in a kind of an Uproar.</P>
<P>The matter was, that a great Sho$l, or as they call it a Scool of Pilchard, came
<PB REF="148" MS="Y">
&s;wimming with the Tide of Flood di|rectly, out of the Sea into the Harbour. My Friend who&s;e Boat we were in, told me this was a Surprize which he would have been very glad of, if he could but have had a Day or two's Warning, for he might have taken 200 Tun of them, and the like was the Ca&s;e of other Merchants in Town; for in &s;hort, no body was ready for them, ex|cept a &s;mall Fi&s;hing Boat, or two; one of which went out into the middle of the Harbour, and at two or three Hawls, took about 40000 of them. We &s;ent our Servant to the Key to buy &s;ome, who for a Halfpenny, brought us &s;eventeen, and if he would have taken them, might have had as many more for the &s;ame Money; with the&s;e we went to Dinner; the Cook at the Inn broil'd them for us, which is their way of dre&s;|&s;ing them, with Pepper and Salt, which co&s;t us about a Farthing; &s;o that two of us, and a Servant din'd, and at a Ta|vern too, for three Farthings, Dre&s;&s;ing and all, and this is the Rea&s;on of tell|ing the Tale: What Drink, Wine, or Beer we had, I do not remember, but whatever it was, that we paid for by it&s;elf; but for our Food we really din'd for three Farthings, and very well too: Our Friend treated us next Day with a Di&s;h of large Lob&s;ters, and I being cu|rious $o know the Value of &s;uch Things, and having freedom enough with him to enquire; I found that for 6d. or 8d. they bought as good Lob&s;ters there, as would have co&s;t in London 3s. to 3s. 6d. each.</P>
<P>In ob&s;erving the coming in of tho&s;e Pilchards, as above, we found that out at Sea, in the Offing, beyond the Mouth of the Harbour the$e was a whole Ar|my of Porpu&s;es, which as they told us pur&s;ued the Pilchards, and 'tis proba|ble drove them into the Harbour, as above. The Scool it &s;eems drove up the River a great way, even as high as Totne&s;s Bridge, as we heard after|wards; &s;o that the Country People who had Boats, and Nets, catch'd as many as they knew what to do wit$ and perhaps liv'd upon Pilchards $word$ &s;everal Days; but as to the Merchan$ and Trade, their coming was &s;o$ den, that it was no Advantage $ them.</P>
<P>Round the We&s;t &s;ide of this $word$ or Harbour in a kind of a Semi $word$ lies the Town of Dartmouth, a ver$ large and populous Town, tho' $word$ meanly built, and &s;tanding on the $word$ of a &s;teep Hill; yet the Key is large and the Street before it &s;pacious. $word$ are &s;ome very flouri&s;hing Merchants who trade very pro&s;perou&s;ly, and to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Trading Ports of Spain Portugal, I$aly, and the Plantation$ but e&s;pecially, they are great Trade$ to Newfoundland, and f$om thence $word$ Spain, and Italy with Fi&s;h, and the$ drive a good Trade al&s;o, in their ow$ Fi&s;hery of Pilchards, whi h is here$bou$ carried on with the greate&s;t Number $word$ Ve&s;&s;els of any Port, in the We&s;t, excep$ Falmouth.</P>
<P>A little to the Southward of th$ Town, and to the Ea&s;t of ths Port, i$ Torbay, of which I know no$hing pro|per to my Ob&s;ervation, $span$ it is a very good Road for S$$p$ $word$ &s;ometimes, e&s;pecially with a $word$ or S. E. Wind, Ships have been oblig$ to quit the Bay, and put to Sea, or $word$ into Dartmouth for Shelter.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e I need not mention, $word$ they had from the Hilly part of $word$ Town, and e&s;pecially from the $word$ oppo&s;ite to it, the noble Pro&s;pect $word$ at that time particularly delightful, $word$ the Prince of Oranges's F$$er, when $word$ came to that Coa&s;t, and as they enter$$ into Torbay, to Land; the P$ince an$ his Army being in Fleet of abo$t $word$ Sail of Tran&s;port Ships, be&s;ides 50 Sail $word$ Men of War of the Line&s;, all which with a fair Wind, and fine Weather came $word$ an Anchor there at once.</P>
<P>This Town as mo&s;t of the Towns $word$ Devon&s;hire are, is full of Di&s;&s;enters, and a very large Meeting hou&s;e they hav$ here; how they act here with $word$
<PB REF="149" MS="Y">
of the great Di&s;pute about the Doctrine $word$ the Trinity, which has caus'd &s;uch a Breach among tho&s;e People at Exce&s;ter, and other Parts of the County I cannot give any account of. This Town &s;ends two Members to Parliament.</P>
<P>From hence we went to Plympton, a poor and thinly Inhabited Town, tho' ble&s;t with the like Privilege of &s;ending Members to the Parliament of which I have little more to &s;ay, but that from thence the Road lyes to Plymouth, di&s;|tance about &s;ix Miles,</P>
<P>Plymouth, is indeed a Town of Con|&s;ideration, and of great Importance to the Publick. The Situation of it between two very large Inlets of the Sea, and in the Bottom of a large Bay, which is very remarkable for the Advantage of Navi|gation. The Sound or Bay is compa&s;s'd on every Side with Hills, and the Shoar generally Steep and Rocky, tho' the An|chorage is good, and it is pretty &s;$f$ rid|$ng: In the Entrance to $his B$y, lyes a $arge and mo&s;t dangerous Rock, which $t High-water is cover'd, but at Low-Tide $yes bare, where many a good Ship $as been lo&s;t, even in the view of Safety, $nd many a Ships Crew drown'd in the Night, before help could be had for them.</P>
<P>Upon this Rock, which was call'd the $dy&s;tone, from its Situation, the famous Mr. Win&s;tanley undertook to build a $ight-Hou&s;e for the Direction of Sailors, $nd with great Art, and Expedition fini&s;h|$d it; which Work con&s;idering its Height, $e Magnitude of its Building, and the $ttle Hold there was, by which it was o&s;&s;ible to Fa&s;ten it to the Rock, &s;tood $ Admiration, and bore out many a bit|$r Storm.</P>
<P>Mr. Win&s;tanly, often vi&s;i&s;ted, and fre|$ently &s;trengthen'd the Building, by new $orks, and was &s;o Confident of its fi$m|$&s;s, and Stability, that he u&s;ually &s;aid, $ only de&s;ir'd to be in it when a S orm ould happen, for many People had told $m, it $ould certainly fall, if it came to $$w a little harder than ordinary.</P>
<P>But he happen'd at la&s;t to be in it once $word$ often; Namely, when that dreadful Tempe&s;t blew, Nov. the 27, 1703. This Tempe&s;t began on the Wedne&s;day before, and Blew with &s;uch Violence, and &s;hook the Light-hou&s;e &s;o much, that as they told me there, Mr. Win&s;tanly would fain have been on Shoar, and made Signals for help, but no Boats dur&s;t go off to him; to fini&s;h the Tragedy, on the Friday, Nov. 26, when the Tempe&s;t was &s;o redoubled, that it became a Terror to $he whole Na|tion; the fir&s;t Sight there Seaward, that the People of Plymouth, were pre&s;ented with in the Morning after the Storm, was the bare Eddy&s;tone, the Light-hou&s;e be|ing gone; in which Mr. Win&s;tanly&punc; and all that were with him peri&s;h'd, and were never &s;een, or heard of &s;ince: But that which was a wor&s;e lo&s;s &s;till, was&punc; that a few Days after a Merchant's Ship $all'd the Winchel&s;ea homeward bou$d from Vir|gina, nor knowing the Eddy$$$ne Light-Hou&s;e was down; for want of the Light that &s;hould have been $span$ of $he Ro$k it&s;elf&punc; and was lo$$ $word$ $word$ her Lading, and mo&s;t of her Men, but $$$$e is now another Light-hou&s;e bu$$t on the &s;ame Rock.</P>
<P>What other Di&s;&s;$&s;te$s happen'd at the &s;ame Time, in the Sound, $$d in the Roads about Plymouth is no$ my B$&s;i|ne&s;s: They are al&s;o publi&s;h'd in other Books, to which I $word$.</P>
<P>One Thing, which I was a Witne&s;s too, on a former Journey to this Plane, I cannot omit: It was the next Year after that great &s;torm&punc; and but a little &s;ooner in the Year, being in Augu&s;t, I was at $lymou h $nd wa$$ing on the Hoo, which is a Plain on the Edge of the Sea, looking to the Road, I ob&s;erv'd the Evening &s;o serene, &s;o calm, &s;o bright, and the Sea &s;o &s;mooth, that a finer Sight, I think, I never &s;aw; there was very lit|tle Wind, but what was, &s;eem'd to be We&s;terly; and, about an Hour after, it blew a little Breeze at South We&s;t, with which Wind there came into the Sound, that Night and the next Morning, a &s;leet of fourteen Sail of Ships, from Barbadoes; richly loaden, for London; having been long at Sea, mo&s;t of the Captains and
<PB REF="150" MS="Y">
P&s;&s;engers came on Shore to refre&s;h th$$&s;elves, as s u&s;ual, after &s;uch tedi|ous Vo$ages, and the Ships rode all i$ $he Sound on that Side next to Cat|water: As is $u&s;tomary upon &s;afe arriv&punc;ing to their na$ive Country, there was a general Joy and Rejoycing, both on board and on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The next Day the Wind began to fre&s;hen, e&s;pecially in the Afternoon, and the &s;ea to be di&s;turb'd, and very hard it blew at Night, but all was well for that time; but the Night after it blew a d ead$ul Sto m, not much infe$ior, for the time it la&s;ted, to the Storm mention'd above, which blew down the Light-Hou&s;e on the Eddy S$one; about Midnight the Noi&s;e indeed was very d eadful, what with the roa ing of the Sea, and o$ the Wind, intermix'd with the fi$ing of Guns for Help from the Ships, the Cries of the Seamen and People on Shore, and, which was wor&s;e, the Cries of tho&s;e, which were driven on Shore by the Tempe&s;t and d$$h'd in Pieces. In a Word, all $he $leet except three, or thereabouts, were da&s;h'd to $ieces again&s;t the Rocks, and &s;unk in the Sea, mo&s;t of the Men b$ing drowned: Tho&s;e three, who were &s;av'd, receiv'd &s;o much damage, that their Lading was almo&s;t all &s;poil'd: One Ship in the Dark of the Night, the Men not knowing where they were, run into Catwater, and run on Shore there, by which &s;he was however &s;av'd from Ship|wreck, and the Lives of her Crew were &s;aved al&s;o.</P>
<P>This was a melancholy Morning in&punc;deed; nothing was to be &s;een but Wrecks of the Ships, and a fo$ming fu$ious Sea, in that very Place where they rode all in Joy and Triumph, but the Evening before: The Captains, Pa&s;&s;engers and Office$s who were, as I have &s;aid gone on Shoar, between the Joy of &s;aving their Lives, and the Affliction of ha|ving lo&s;t their Ships, their Cargoes, and their Friends, were Obj$cts indeed worth our Compa&s;&s;ion; and there was a great Variety of the Pa&s;&s;ions to be ob&s;erv'e in them: Now lamenting their Lo&s;&s;e then giving Thanks for their Deliv$$ ance, many of the Pa&s;&s;engers had $word$ their All, and were, as they expre&s;s'd them&s;elves, utterly undo$e; they were, I &s;ay, now lamenting their Lo&s;&s;es, with violent Exce&s;&s;es of Grief; then giving Thanks for their Lives, and that they &s;hould be brought on Shore, as it were, on purpo&s;e to be &s;av'd f$em Death&punc; then again in Tears for &s;uch as were drowned; the various Ca&s;es were in|deed very affecting, and, in many Things, very in&s;tructing</P>
<P>As, I &s;ay, Plymouth lies in the bot|tom of this Sound, in the center be|tween he two Waters, &s;o there lies again&s;t it, in the &s;ame Po&s;ition, an I$|land, which they call St. Nicholas, on which there is a Ca&s;tle, which Com|mands the entrance into Ham Oze, and indeed that al&s;o into Catawar in &s;ome Degree: In this I&s;land the famous Ge|neral Lambert one of Cromwell's great Agents, or Officers in the Rebellion was impri&s;on'd for Life, and liv'd many Years there.</P>
<P>On the Shore, over-again&s;t this I&s;land, is the $$itadel of Plymouth, a &s;mall but regular For ification, i$a$ce&s;&s;ible by Sea, but not exceeding &s;trong by Land, ex|cept that they &s;ay the Works are of a Stone, hard as Marble, and would not &s;oon yield to the Batteries of an Ene|my: But that is a language our modes Engineers now laugh at.</P>
<P>The Town &s;tands above this, upon the &s;ame Rock, and lies &s;loping on the &s;ide of it, towards the Ea&s;t; the Inlet of the Sea, which is call'd Catwa|ter, and which is a Harbour, capable of receiving any Number of Ships, and of any &s;ize, wa&s;hing the Ea&s;tern Sho$e of the Town where they have a kind of natural Mole, or Haven, with a Key, and all other Conveniencies for bringing in Ve&s;&s;els for loading and un|loading; nor is the Trade carried on here incon&s;iderable in it&s;elf, or the number of Merchants &s;mall.</P>
<P><PB REF="151" MS="Y">
The other Inlet of the Sea, as I term it, on the other &s;ide of the Town, and is $lled Ham-Oze, being the Mouth of $e River Tamar, a con&s;iderable River, $hich parts the two Counties of Devon $d Cornwall: Here the War with France $aking it nece&s;&s;ary that the Ships of War $ould have a Retreat nearer Hand than Port&s;mouth, the late King William $der'd a wet Dock, with Yards, dry $cks, Launches, and Conveniencies of kinds for Building, and repairing of $ips to be built; and with the&s;e $word$ nece&s;&s;arily the building of Store|$u&s;es and Ware-hou&s;es, for the Rigging, $ls, naval and military Stores, &amp;c. of $h Ships as may be appointed to be laid there, as now &s;everal are, with very $nd&s;ome Hou&s;es for the Commi&s;&s;ioners, $d Offi$ers of all kinds u&s;ual in the $ng's Yards, to dwell in: It is in &s;hort, $w become as compleat an Ar&s;enal, or $rd, for building and fitting Men $f War any the Government are Ma&s;ters of, $word$ perhaps much more Convenient than $ne of them, tho' not &s;o large.</P>
<P>The building of the&s;e things, with the $dition of Rope-walks, and Ma&s;t-yards, $word$ as it brought abundance of Trades|$ple, and Workmen to the Place, &s;o $y began by little and little to build $u&s;es on the Lands adjacent, till at $word$ there appeared a very hand&s;ome $eet, &s;pacious and large, and as well $abited, and &s;o many Hou&s;es are &s;in$e $ed, that it is become a con&s;iderable $wn, and mu&s;t of Co$&s; quence in time $w abundance of People from Plymouth $word$</P>
<P>$owever, the Town of Plymouth is, will always be a very con&s;iderable $wn, while that excellent Harbour $es it &s;uch a general Port for the re|$ing all the Fleets of Merchants Ships $n the Southward, as from Spain, Italy, We&s;t-Indies, &amp;c. who generally make $e fir&s;t Port to put in at for Refre&s;h|$t, or &s;afety, from either Weather or $word$.</P>
<P>$he Town is populous and wealthy, $word$ as above, &s;everal con&s;iderable Mer+chants, and abundance of wealthy Shop|keepers, who&s;e Trade depends upon &s;up|plying the Sea-faring People, that upon &s;o many Occa&s;ions put into that Port; as for Gentlemen, I mean tho&s;e that are &s;uch by Family, and Birth, and way of living, it cannot be expected to find many &s;uch in a Town, meerly dep$nding on Trade, Shipping and Sea faring Bu&s;ine&s;s, yet I found here &s;ome Men of Value, Per&s;ons of liberal Education, general Knowledge, and excellent Behaviour, who&s;e Society obliges me to &s;ay, that a Gentleman might find very agreeable Company in Ply|mouth.</P>
<P>From Plymouth we pa&s;s the Tamar, over a Ferry to Salta&s;h, a little poor &s;hat|ter'd Town, the fi$&s;t we &s;at Foot on in the County of Cornwall.

<P>S$lta&s;h &s;eems to be the Ruins of a lar|ger Place, and we &s;aw many Hou&s;es as it were falling down, and I doubt not but the Mice and Rats have abandoned many more a$ they &s;ay they will, when they are likely to $$il; yet this Town is govern'd by a $span$ has many Privileges &s;ends $word$ $word$ Par|liament, take $oll of all V$&s;&s; l$ that pa&s;s the River, and have the &s;ole Oy&s;ter Fi&s;h|ing in the whole River, which is con|&s;iderable Mr. Carew, Author of the Survey of Cornwall&punc; tells us a &s;trange Story of a Dog in this Town, of whom it was ob&s;erved, that if they gave him any large Bone, or piece of Meat he immediately went out of Doors with it, and after having di&s;appeared for &s;ome time, would return again, upon which after &s;ome time they watch'd him, when to their great Surpri&s;e they found that the poor charitable Creature carryed what he &s;o got to an old de$rip'd Ma$$i$f, which lay in a Ne&s;t that he had made among the Brakes a little way out of the Town, and was blind; &s;o that he could not help him|&s;elf, and there this Creature fed him; he adds, al&s;o, that on Sundays, or Hol|lydays,
<PB REF="152" MS="Y">
when he found they made good Chear in the Hou&s;e, where he liv'd, he would go out, and bring this old blind Dog to the Door, and feed him there till he had enough, and then go with him back to his Habitation in the Country a|gain, and &s;ee him &s;afe in; if this Story is true, it is very Remarkable indeed, and I thought it worth telling, becau&s;e the Aurhor was a Per&s;on, who they &s;ay might be credited.</P>
<P>This Town has a kind of Juri&s;diction upon the River Tamar do$n to the Mouth of the $ort, &s;o that they claim Anchorage o$ all &s;mall Ships that enter the River, their Coroner &s;its upon all derd Bodies that are found drown'd in the River, and the like, but they make not much Profit of them. There is a Market here, and that is the be&s;t thing to be &s;aid of the Town, it is al&s;o very encrea&s;ed &s;ince the Number of the Inha|bitants are encrea&s;ed at the New Town, as $ menti ned, as near the Dock at the Mouth of Ham Oaze, for tho&s;e People choo&s;e rather to go to Salta&s;h to Market by Water, then to walk to Plymouth by Land for their Provi&s;ions; becau&s;e, fir&s;t, as they go in the Town Boat, the &s;ame B$at brings home what they buy; &s;o that it is much le&s;s Trouble, (&s;econd,) becau&s;e Provi&s;ions are bought much chea|per at Salta&s;h, than at Plymouth: This I &s;ay, is like to be a very great Advantage to the Town of Salta&s;h, and may in time put a new Face of Wealth upon the Place.</P>
<P>They talk of &s;ome Merchants begin|ning to Trade here, and they have &s;ome Ships that $&s;e the Newfoundland Fi&s;hery; but I could not hear of any thing con|&s;iderable they do in it, there is no other con&s;iderable Town up the Tamar, till we come to Lan$e$$on, the County Town, which I &s;hall take in my Return, &s;o I turn'd We&s;t, keeping the South Shore of the County, to the Lands End.</P>
<P>F$om Salta&s;h I went ot Liskard, about 7 Miles.

<P>This Town of Li$kard was once Emi|nent, had a good $a$tle&punc; and a $word$ Hou&s;e, where the antient Dukes of $word$ wall kept their Court in tho&s;$ $word$ al&s;o it enjoy'd &s;everal Privileges $&s;p$$i|ally by the Favour of the Black P$$n$e, who, as Prince of Wales, and Duke of Cornwall re&s;ided here; and in return, they &s;ay this Town, and the Country round it, rais'd a great Body of &s;tout young Fellows, who enter'd into his Ser|vice, and followed his Fortunes in his Wars in France, as al&s;o in Spain: But the&s;e Buildings are &s;o decay'd, that there are now &s;carce any of the Ruins of the Ca&s;tle, or of the Prince's Court remain|ing</P>
<P>The only publick Edifices they have now to &s;how, are the Guild, or $$wn-Hall, on which there is a $span$ fine Clock; a very good Free $word$ we$$ provided; a very fi$e Condu$$ in the Market-place; an anient lage Church, and which is &s;omething $are, for the County of Cornwall, a large new bui$$ $eeting-hou&s;e for the Diffente$s, which I name, becau&s;e they a&s;&s;u$'d me $word$ was but three more, and tho&s;e very in|con&s;iderable in all the County of Corn|wall; whereas in Devon&s;hire, which is the next County, there are $word$ a|bout &s;eventy, &s;ome of which are exceed|ing large and fine.</P>

<P>On the Hills North of Liskard, and the way between Liskard and Lance on, there are many Tin Mines, and they told us &s;ome of the riche&s;t Veins that Metal are found there, that are the whole County; the Metal when $word$ at the blowing Hou&s;es into Blocks, $word$ as above, carry'd to Liskard to Coin'd.</P>

<P>On this South &s;ide we c$me to Foy, or Fowey, an ancient Town, and for|merly very large; nay, not large only, but Powerful and $ o$ent, lo$ the $ovens, as they were then call'd, were able to fit out out large Flee$s, not only for Merchants Ship, but even of Men of War; and with the&s;e not only &s;ought with, but &s;everal times vanqui&s;hed, and routed the Squ$dron of the Cinque Port Men, who in tho&s;e Days were thought very powerful.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden ob&s;erves, that the Town of Foy Quarters &s;ome part of the Arms of every one of t$eir Cinque Ports with their own; intimating, that they had at &s;everal times trampled over them all; certain it is, they did often beat them, and $ook their Ship, and brought them as good Prizes into their Haven of Foy, and carry'd it &s;o high, that they fitted out their Fleets again&s;t the French, and took &s;everal of their Men of War when they were at War wi$h Eng|land, and e$$ich'd their Town by the &s;poil of their Enemies.</P>
<P>Edward $V. favour'd them much, and becau&s;e the French threaten'd them, to come up their River with a powerful Navy to burn their Town, he caus'd two Forts to be built at the publick Charge, for &s;ecurity of the Town and River, which Forts at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;how of thom remain there &s;till, but the &s;ame King Edward was &s;ome time after &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted at the Town&s;men for offi i|ou&s;ly falling upon the French after a Truce was made, and proclaim'd, that he effectually di$arm'd them, took away their whole Fleet, Ships, Tackle, Ap|parel and Furniture; and &s;ince that time we do not read of any of their Naval exploits nor that they ever re$over'd, or attempted to recover their Strength at Sea: However, Foy, at this time, is a very fair Town, it lies extended on the

Ea&s;t &s;ide of the River for above a Mile the Buildings fair; and there are a great many flouri&s;hing Merchants in it, who have a great &s;hare in the Fi&s;hing Trade e&s;pecially for Pilchards, of which they take a great quantity hereabouts In this Town&punc; is al&s;o a Coinage for the Tian, of which a great Quantity is dug up in the Country, North and We&s;t of the Town.</P>
<P>The River Fowey, which is very Broad and Deep here, was formerly Navigable by Ships of good Burthen as high as Le&s;twithiel an ancient, and once a floari&s;hing, but now a decay'd Town, and as to Trade and Navigation quite de&s;titute, which is occa&s;ioned by the River being fill'd up with Sands, which &s;ome &s;ay, the Tides drive up in Sto$m$ Weather from the Sea; others &s;ay 'tis by Sands wa&s;h'd from the Lead Mines in the Hills; the la&s;t of which (by the way) I take to be a Mi&s;take, the Sand from the Hills being not of Quantity &s;ufficient to fill up the Chan|nel of a Navigable River, and if it had, might ea&s;ily have been &s;topped by the Towns People from falling into the River; but that the Sea has choak'd up the River with Sand, is not only pro|bable but true, and there are other Rivers which &s;uffer in the like manner in this &s;ame Country.</P>
<P>This Town of Le&s;twithiel, retains however &s;everal Advantages, which &s;up|port its Figure, as fir&s;t, that it is one of the Coinage Towns, as I call them, or Stanuary Towns, as others call them. (2.) The common Goal for the whole Stanuary is here, as are al&s;o the County Courts for the whole County of Corn|wall.</P>
<P>There is a mock Cavalcade kept up at this Town, which is very remarkable, the Particulars, as they are related by Mr Carew in his Survey of Cornwall, take as follows.</P>
<P>Upon little Ea&s;ter Sunday, the Free|holders of this Town and Mannor by them&s;elves, or their Deputies, did there A&s;&s;emble: Among&s;t whom, one (as it fell to his Lot by turn) bravely appara$ led, gallantly mounted, with a Craw on his Head, a Scepter in his Hand an a Sword borne before him, and d$$ fully attended by all the re&s;t al&s;o o$ Hor&s;eback, rode thro' the principal St$$$ to the Church: The Curate in his be Be&s;een &s;olemnly received him at th$ Church-yard Stile, and conducted hi$ to hear divine Service: After whi$$ he repaired with the &s;ame Pomp, $word$ a Hou&s;e provided for that purpo&s;e mad$ a Fea&s;t to his Attendants kept the T$+bles and him&s;elf, and was &s;erved wit kneeling A&s;&s;ay, and all other Right due to the E&s;tate of a Prince: Wit which Dinner, the Ceremony ende$ and every Man returned Home ag$$ The Pedigree of this U&s;age is deri$$ from &s;o many De&s;cents of Ages th$ the Cau&s;e and Author out-reach the R$+membrance: Howbeit, the&s;e Circum&s;ta$+ces afford a Conjecture, that it &s;hould be token Royalties appertaining to the Ho$+our of Cornwall.</P>

<P>But let this be as it will, the Trade is now in a manner wholly gone to Falmouth, the Trade at Truro, being now chiefly if not only for the Shipping off of Block $in and Copper Oar, the latter being lately found in large Quan|tities in &s;ome of the Mountains be|tween Truro, and St. Michaels, and which is much improv'd &s;ince the &s;e|veral Mills, are erected at Bri&s;tol, and other Parts, for the Manufactures of Battery were, as 'tis call'd, Bra&s;s, or which is made out of Engli&s;h Copper, mo&s;t of it dug in the&s;e Parts; the Oar it&s;elf al&s;o being found very Rich and Good.</P>
<P>Falmouth is well built, has abun|dance of Shipping belonging to it, is full of rich Merchants, and has a flou|ri&s;hing and encrea&s;ing Trade. I &s;ay encrea&s;ing, becau&s;e by the late &s;etting up the Engli&s;h Packets between this Port and Lisbon, there is a new Com|merce between Portugal and this Town, carried on to a very great Value.</P>
<P>It is true, Part of this Trade was founded in a clande&s;tine Commerce, carried on by the &s;aid Packets at Lis|bon, where being the King's Ships and claiming the Privilege of not bei$g &s;earched, or vi&s;ited by the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers, they found means to carry off great Quantities of Briti&s;h Manufactures, which they &s;old on Board to the Por|tugue&s;e Merchants, and they convey'd them on Shoar, as 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed without paying Cu&s;tom</P>
<P>But the Government there, getting Intelligence of it, and Complaint being made in England al&s;o, where it was found to be very prejudicial to the fair Merchant, that Trade has been effec|tually &s;topp'd; but the Falmouth Mer|chants having by this Means gotten a Ta&s;te of the Portugue&s;e Trade, have maintain'd it ever &s;ince&punc;in Ships of their own: The&s;e Packets bring over &s;u$$ va&s;t Quantities of Gold in Specie ei her in Moidores, which is the Portugal Coin, or in Bars of Gold, that I am very credible inform'd the Carrier from Fal|mouth, brought by Land from thence to London, at one time in the Month of January, 1722, or near it&punc; Eight Thou&s;and Moidores in Gold&punc; whi$$ came from Li bon in the $span$ for Account of the Me chan$s a$ Lon|don, and that it was atte$ded wi$h a Guard of 12 Hor&s;emen $span$ which the &s;aid Carrier had H lf pe$ Ce $ for his Hazard.</P>
<P>This is a Spe$ime$ of the $word$ Trade, and how co$&s;ide$abl$ $span$ its &s;elf, as well as how Advantageon $word$ England, but as that is n$$ to th p$$+&s;ent Ca&s;e, I p$oceed; the $word$ for all the Towns in this $o$, and the Head Collector E&s;tabli&s;$$d at $$is Town, where the Duties in$luding&punc; the other Ports is very con&s;ide$$ble: $word$ is al&s;o a very g$eat Fi&s;hing for Pil|chards, and the M rchants for Fal|mouth, have the chief Stroke in that gainful Trade.</P>
<P>Truro is however a very con&s;iderable Town too; it &s;tands up the Water North and by Ea&s;t from Falmou$$ in the utmo&s;t extended Branch of the H$|ven, in the middle, between the Con|flux of two Rivers, which tho' not of any long Cour&s;e have a very g$od p$|pearance $or a Port, and m$ke $ $word$ Wharf between them in the Front of the Town; and the Water here $word$ a good Port for &s;mall Ships, tho' $span$ at the Influx, but not for Ship&punc; of Bu$|then.

<P>About 8 a Clo k in the Evening the Commander, who&s;e Name was A$$$ony Jenkins, went on Board with his Mate to &s;ee that every Thing was &s;afe, and to give Orders, but went both on &s;hoar a gain, leaving only a Man and two Boys on Bord, not apprehending any Danger, they being in &s;afe Ha bour; howeve$, he ordered them, that if i$ &s;hould blow hard, they &s;hould carry out the &s;mall Bower Anchor, and &s;o to Moo$ the Ship by two Anchors, and then giving what other Orders he thought to be need|ful, he went a&s;hore, as above.</P>
<P>About 9 o'Clock, the Wind begi ni g to blow harder, they carryed out the Anchor according to the Ma&s;ter's Order but the Wind encrea&s;ing about 10, the Ship beg$n to drive, &s;o they carry$d out their be&s;t Bower, which having a good new Cable, brought the Ship up. $he Storm &s;till encrea&s;ing they let go the

<P>But between 11 and 12 a Clock, the Wind came about We&s;t and by South, and blew in &s;o violent and terrible a manner, that tho' they ride under the Lee of a high Shore, yet the Ship was driven from all her Anchors and about Midnight drove quite out of the Har|bour (the opening of the Harbour ly|ing due Ea&s;t and We&s;t) i $o the open Sea, the Men having nei her Anchor or Cable, or Boat to help them&s;elves</P>
<P>In this dreadful Condition, they d$iv|ing, I &s;ay, out of the Harbour: Their fir&s;t and chief care was to go clear of the Rocks, which lie on $ither &s;ide the Harbour's $ outh, and which they per form'd pretty well; then &s;eeing no Remedy, they con&s;ulted what to do next. They could carry no Sail at fir&s;t, no not a Knot, nor do any thing but run away afore it: The only thing they had to think on, was to keep ner out at Sea as far as the could, for fear of a Po$ of Land, called The Dead Man's $ead, which lyes to the Ea&s;tward of Falmouth Haven, and then if they could e&s;cape the Land, thought to run in for Plymouth, next Morning, $&s;o If po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ave their Lives.</P>
<P>In this frighted Condition they drove a|way at a prodigious Rate, h$ving &s;ome|times the Bonnet of their Fore&s;ail a little out, but the Yard lower'd almo&s;t to the Deck; &s;ometimes the Ship al|mo&s;t under Water, and &s;ometimes above, keeping &s;till in the Offing, for fear of the Land, till they might &s;ee Day light; but when the Day brake they found they werre far enough beyond it, and the fir&s;t Land they made was Pever$l Point, being the Southe mo&s;t Land of the I&s;le of Purbeck in Dor&s;et&s;hire, and a little to the We&s;tward of the I&s;le of Wight; &s;o that now they were in a terrible Con&s;ternation, and driving &s;till at a prodigious Rate, by 7 a Clock they &s;ound them&s;elves B o$d Side of the I&s;le of Wight.</P>
<P>Here they con&s;ult$d again wh$ do to &s;ave their Lives; one $word$ Boys was for running her $word$ Downs, but the $word$ objected having no Anchor o $span$ to go on Shore wi h&punc; and $span$ blowing off Shore, in the $span$ they &s;hould be $span$ and lo&s;t upon the $span$ win, which $span$ been once $span$,</P>

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX</HI> TO JOURNEY III.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE ended this Account at the utmo&s;t Extent of the I&s;land of Great Britain We&s;t, without vi&s;iting tho&s;e Excre&s;&s;ences of the I&s;land&punc; as I think I may call them, viz. the Rocks of Scilly, of which, what is mo&s;t famous, is their infamy, or Re|proach: Namely, How many good Ships are, almo&s;t continually da&s;h'd in pieces there, and how many brave Lives lo&s;t, in &s;pight of the Mariners be&s;t Skill or the Light-Hou&s;es, and other Sea Marks of be&s;t Notice.</P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands lie &s;o in the middle be|tween the two va&s;t openings of the North and South narrow Seas, or as the Sailors call then the Bri&s;tol Channel, and the Channel, (&s;o call'd by way of Eminence) that it cannot, or perhaps never will be avoided, but that &s;everal Ships in the dark of the Night, and in &s;tre&s;s of Wea|ther may by being out in their Reckon|ings, or other unavoidable Accidents mi|&s;take, and if they do, they are &s;ure, as the Sailors call it, to run bump a Shore upon Scilly, where they find no Quarter among the Breakers, but are beat to pieces, without any po&s;&s;ibili|lity of E&s;cape.</P>
<P>One can hardly mention the Bi&s;hop and his Clerks, as they are call'd, or the Rocks of Scilly, without $span$ to the Memory of Sir Cloud$&s;$ $word$ and all the gallant Spirits that were with him at one Blow, and without a moments Warning d$&s;t'd into a State $word$ Imm$$|lity; the Admiral with $span$ War, and all their Men $word$ upon the&s;e Rocks right afore the Wind, and in a dark Nigh$$ being lo&s;t there and not a Man &s;aved But all o$$ $word$ and Hi&s;tories are full of this&punc; &s;o I need &s;ay no more.</P>
<P>They tell us of eleven ail of Merchan$ Ships homeward-bou$d, and $ich y $word$ from the Southward, who ha$ the like Fate, in the &s;ame Place, $word$ great many Year$ ago; and that &s;ome of them coming from Spa$$, $word$ having a great Quantity of $word$ $word$ Pieces of Eight on Board, the $word$ frequently drives on &s;hore &s;till, $span$ in good Quantities, e&s;pecially after from my Weather.</P>
<P>This may be the Rea&s;on why as $word$ ob&s;erved during our &s;hort &s;tay here, &s;e|veral Mornings after, it had blown &s;ome|thing hard in the Night, the Sands $$$|cover'd with Country People $word$ too and fro' to &s;ee if the Sea had $word$ up any thing of value.

<P>Nor is it &s;eldom that the voracious Country People &s;cuffle and fight about the Right to what they find, and that in a de&s;perate manner, &s;o that this Part of Cornwall may truly be &s;aid to be inha|bited by a fierce and ravenous People; $span$ are &s;o greedy, and eager for the $word$, that they are charged with &s;trange, $word$, and cruel Dealings, even &s;ome|times with one another, but e&s;pecially with po$ di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Sea-men when they come on Sho$e by force of a Tempe&s;t, and &s;eek help for their Lives, and where they find the Rocks them&s;elves not more mercile&s;s than the People who range a|bout them for their Prey.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o, as a farther Te&s;timony of the immen&s;e Riches which have been lo&s;t at &s;everal tim s upon this Coa&s;t, we found &s;everal Engineers, and Projectors; &s;ome with one &s;ort of diving Engine, add &s;ome with another; &s;ome claiming &s;uch a wreck, and &s;ome &s;uch and &s;uch others; where they alledg'd, they were a&s;&s;ured there were g eat Quantitie of Money; and &s;trange unpre$edented Ways were u&s;ed by them to come at it; Some, I &s;ay, with one kind of Engine, and &s;ome ano|ther; and tho' we thought &s;everal of them very &s;trange impracticable Me|thods, yet, I was a&s;&s;ur'd by the Country People, that they had done Wonders with them under Water, and that &s;ome of them had taken up things of great Weight, and in a great Depth of Water; others had &s;plit open the Wrecks they had found, in a manner one would have thought not po&s;&s;ible to be done, &s;o far under Water, and had taken out things from the very Holds of the Ships; but we could not learn, that they had come at any pieces of Eight, which was the thing they &s;eemed mo&s;t to aim at, and depend up on; at lea&s;t they had not found any great Quantity, as they &s;aid they expected.</P>
<P>However, we left them as bu&s;y as we found them, and far f om being di&s;courag|ed, and if half the Golden Mountains, or Silver Mountains either, which they promi&s;e them&s;elves, &s;hould appear, they will be very well paid for their Labour.</P>
<P>From the Tops of the Hills, on this Extremity of the Land, you may &s;ee out into that they call the Chop, of the Chan|nel, whi h, as it is the greate&s;t Inlet of Commerce, and the mo&s;t frequenced by Merchant Ships of any Place in the World; &s;o one &s;eldom looks out to Sea|ward, but &s;omething, new pre&s;ents; that is to &s;ay, of Ships pa&s;&s;ing or repa&s;&s;ing, either on the great or le&s;&s;er Cannel.</P>
<P>Upon a former accidental Journey into this $a$t of the Country, during the War with France, it was with a mixture of Plea&s;ure and Ho$or that we &s;aw from the Hills at the Lizard, which is the Souther|mo&s;t Point of this Land an ob&s;tinate Fight between three French-men of War, and two Engli&s;h, wi h a Privateer, and three Merchant-Ships in their Company&punc; the Engli&s;h had the Misfortune, not only to be fewer Ships of War in Number, but of le&s;s Force; &s;o that while the two bigge&s;t French Ships engaged the Engli&s;h, the Third in the mean time took the two Merchant-Ships, and went off with them; as to the Piccaroo$, or Privateer, &s;he was able to do little in the Matter, $$t dur|ing to come &s;o ne r the Men of War, as to take a B oad&s;ide, which her thin Side&punc;would not have been able to $ear, but would have &s;ent her to the Bottom at once; &s;o that the Engli&s;h Men of War had no A&s;&s;i&s;tance f om her, nor o$ld &s;he prevent the taking the two Merchant Ships; yet we ob&s;erved that the Engli&s;h Captains managed their F ght &s;o well, and their Seamen behaved &s;o briskly, that in about three Hou s $word$ the French|men &s;tood off and being &s;uffi iently bang'd, let us &s;ee that they had no more Stomach to Fight; after whi h the Eng|li&s;h, having Damage enough too no doubt,

&s;tood away to the Ea&s;tward, as we &s;up|pos'd, $o R$fit</P>
<P>This Point of the Lizard, which runs out to the Southward, and the other Promontory mention'd above, make the two Angles, or Horns, as they are call'd, from whence 'tis &s;uppos'd this County re|ceiv'd its fir&s;t Name of Cornwall, or as Mr. Cambden &s;ays, Cornubia in the Lat|in, and in the Briti&s;h Kernaw, as running out in two va&s;tly extended Horns; and indeed it &s;eems, as if Nature had form'd this $ituation for the Direction of Mari|ners, as foreknowing of what Importance it &s;hould be, and how in future Ages the&s;e Seas &s;hould be thus throng'd with Mer|chant Ships&punc; the Protection of whole Wealth, and the Safety of the People; navigating them, was &s;o much her early Care, that &s;he &s;tretched out the Land &s;o very many ways, and extended the Points and $omon$o$ies &s;o for, and in &s;o many diffe ent places into the Sea, that the Land might be more ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd at a due Di&s;tance, which way &s;oever the Ships &s;hould come.</P>
<P>Nor is the Lizard Point le&s;s u&s;eful (tho' not &s;o far We&s;t) than the other, which is more properly call'd the Land's End; but if we may Credit our Mariners, it is more frequently, fir&s;t di&s;cover'd f om the Sea; for as our Mariners knowing by the Soundings when they are in the Mouth of the Channel, do then mo&s;t na|turally &s;tand to the Southward, to avoid mi&s;taking the Channel, and to $word$ un the Seven Sea, or Bri&s;tol Channel, but &s;till more to avoid running upon Scilly, and the Rocks about it, as is ob&s;erved before: I &s;ay, as they carefully keep to the South|ward, till they think they are fair with the Channel, and then &s;tand to the Northward again, or North Ea&s;t, to make the Land; this is the Rea&s;on why the Lizard is generally &s;peaking, the fir&s;t Land they make, and not the Land's-End.</P>
<P>Then having made the Lizard, they either (fi &s;t) run in for Falmouth, which is the next Port, if they are taken &s;hort with Ea&s;terly Winds, or are in want of Provi&s;ions and Refre&s;hment, or have any thing out of Order, &s;o that they care not to keep the Sea, or, (2dly) &s;tand a|way for the Ram Head, and Ply $outh Sound, or (3dly) keep an Offing to run up the Channel.</P>
<P>So that the Lizard is the general Guide, and of more u&s;e in the&s;e Ca&s;es than the other point, and is $word$ the Land, which the Ships choo&s;e to make fir&s;t, for then al&s;o they are &s;ure that they are pa&s;t Scilly, and all the dan|gers of that part of the I&s;land</P>
<P>Nature has fortify'd this part of the I&s;land of Britain in a &s;trange manner, and &s;o as &s;he is worth a Traveller's Ob|&s;ervation, as if &s;he new the Force and Violence of the mighty Ocean, which beats upon it; and which indeed, it the Land was not made firm in Propo$ti$$, could not with&s;tand, but would have been wa&s;h'd away long ago,</P>
<P>Fi &s;t, there are the $&s;land, of Scill$ and the Rocks about them, the&s;e $word$ placed like Out-works to re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t A&s;&s;aults of this Enemy, and &s;o break the Force of it; as the Piles, or Sta$lings ($word$ they are called) are placed before the &s;olid Stone work of London-Bridge, $$|fence off the Force, either of the Water&punc; or Ice, or any thing el&s;e that might be dangerous to the Work.</P>
<P>Then there are a va&s;t Number of $word$ Rocks, (&s;o the Seamen call them,) be|&s;ides &s;uch as are vi&s;ible, and above Water&punc; which gradually le&s;&s;on the Quan$i y o$ Water, that would otherwi&s;e lye $word$ infinite Weight and Force upon the Land; 'tis ob&s;erved, that the&s;e Rocks lye under Water for a great way off into the $word$ on every Side the &s;aid two Horns $word$ Points of Land; &s;o breaking the $word$ of the Water, and as above le&s;&s;ening the Weight of it.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, the whole Terra $word$, or Body of the Land, which makes this Part of the I&s;le of Britain, &s;eems to be one &s;olid Rock, as if it was formed by $ature to re&s;i&s;t the otherwi&s;e irre&s;i&s;ti|ble Power of the Ocean, and indeed $word$ one was to ob&s;erve with what Fury $word$
<PB REF="163" MS="Y">
Sea comes on &s;ometimes again&s;t the &s;hore there, e&s;pecially at the Lizard Point, where there are but few, if any Out|works, (as I call them to re&s;i&s;t it, How high the Waves come rowling forward, &s;torming on the Neck of one another; particularly when the Wind blows off Sea, one would wonder, that even the &s;tronge&s;t Rocks them&s;elves &s;hould be able to re&s;i&s;t, and repel them. But, as I &s;aid, the Country &s;eems to be as it were one great Body of Stone, and pre|par'd &s;o on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And yet, as if all this was not enough, Nature has p ovided another &s;trong $ence, and that is, that the&s;e va&s;t Rocks $re, as it were, cemented together by $he &s;olid and weighty Oar of Tin and Copper, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, which is $lentifully found upon the very utmo&s;t $dge of the Land, and with which the $tones may be &s;aid to be Soder'd together, $&s;t the Force of the Sea &s;hould &s;eparate $$d disjoint them, and &s;o break in upon $$&s;e Fortifications of the I&s;land, to de|$roy its chief Security.</P>
<P>This is certain, that there is a more $an ordinary Quantity of Tin, Copper, $d Lead al&s;o placed by the great Di|$ctor of Nature in the&s;e very remote $ngles; and, as I have &s;aid above, the $$r is found upon the very Surface of $word$ Rocks a good way into the Sea, and $t it does not only lie, as it were, $on, or between the Stones among $word$ Earth, which in that Ca&s;e might be $&s;hed from it by the Sea, but that it $even blended or mix'd in with the $nes them&s;elves, that the Stones mu&s;t &s;plit into pieces to come at it; by this $ture the Rocks are made infinitely Weighty and Solid, and thereby &s;till the more qualified to repel the Force of the Sea.</P>
<P>Upon this remote part of the I&s;land we &s;aw great Numbers of that famous kind of Crows, which is known by the Name of the Corni&s;h Cough, or Chough, &s;o the Country People call them: They are the &s;ame kind, which are found in Switzerland among the Alph, and which Pliny pretended, w re peculiar to tho&s;e Mountains, and calls the Pyrrhocorax; the Body is Black, the Legs, Feet, and Bill of a deep Yellow; almo&s;t to a Red; I could not fi d that it was affected for and good quality it had, nor is the Fle&s;h good to eat, for it &s;eeds much on Fi&s;h and Carrion, it is counted little better than a Kite, for it is of ra|venous Quality, and is very mi&s;chievous; it will &s;teal and carry away any thing it finds about the Hou&s;e, that is not too heavy, tho' fit not for its Food, as Knives, Forks Spoons and Linnen Cloths, or whatever it can fly away with, &s;ometimes they &s;ay it has &s;tolen bits of Firebrands, or lighted Candles, and lodged them in the Stacks of $orn, and the Thatch of B$rns and Hou&s;es, and &s;et them on fire; but this I only had by oral Tradition.</P>
<P>I might take up many Sheets in de|&s;cribing the valuable Curio&s;ities of this little Chero&s;one&s;e, or Ne$k Land, call'd the Land's End, in which there lies an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure, and many Things worth Notice, I mean be&s;ides tho&s;e to be found upon the Surface: But I am too near the End of this Letter.

<HEAD>JOURNEY IV.</HEAD>
<P>MY Account of the la&s;t Journey ended where Nature ended her Account, when &s;he meet|ed out the I&s;land, and where &s;he fix'd the utmo&s;t We&s;tern Bounds of Britain; and, being re&s;olved to &s;ee the very Extremity of it, I &s;et my Foot into the Se$, as it were, beyond the farthe&s;t Inch of dry Land We&s;t, as I had done before near the Town of Dover, at the Foot of the Rocks of the South-Fore|land in Kent, which I think, is the far|the&s;t Point Ea&s;t in a Line; and as I had done, al&s;o, at Leo&s;toff in Suffolk, which is another Promontory on the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t, and is reckoned the farthe&s;t Land Ea&s;tward of the I&s;land in General: Like|wi&s;e, I had u&s;ed the &s;ame Ceremony at Sel&s;y, near Colche&s;ter, which I take to be the farthe&s;t Land South&punc; except at Portland only, which, as it is not really an I&s;land, may be called, The farthe&s;t Land South; &s;o, in its Place, I &s;hall giae you an Account of the &s;ame Curio|&s;itv at John a Grot's Hou&s;e in Caithne&s;s, thy farthe&s;t Piece of Ground in Great-Bretain, North.</P>
<P>$word$ had once, indeed, re&s;olved to have coa&s;ted the whole Circuit of Britain by Sea, as 'tis &s;aid, Agricola the Roman General did; and in this Voyage I would have gone about every Promontory, and i$$o the Bottom of every Bay, and had provided my&s;elf a good Yatcht, and an able Commander for that Purpo&s;e; but I found at would be too hazardous an Undertaking for any Man to ju&s;tify him|&s;elf in the doing it upon the mee$ Foun|dation of Curio&s;ity, and having no other Bu&s;ine&s;s at all, &s;o I gave it over.</P>
<P>There was another Difficulty al&s;o&punc; up|on which any Navigator, or Comman|der, as I called him, who was an old experienced Seaman, di&s;&s;uaded me from that Undertaking; and that wa$$ the Nece&s;&s;ity of getting Pilots to every Part, of the Coa&s;t, and to every Port, River, and Creek, and the Danger of not get|ting them: The Nece&s;&s;ity was plain; For that, as I propo&s;ed to keep all the Way near, or under the Shore to en|ter into all the Bayes, and Mouths of Rivers, and Creeks, as above; 1. It would be impracticable to find any &s;ingle Man that knew &s;o perfectly the whole Coa&s;t, as to venture in without Pilots. 2. Pi|lots would not always be found, e&s;pe|cially on the North and We&s;t Coa&s;ts of Scotland; &s;o I laid it a&s;ide, I &s;ay, as a hopele&s;s, and too dangerous Ad|venture, and &s;atisfied my&s;elf to make the Circuit very near as perfect by Land, which I have done with much $word$ Hazard, though with much more Pa$s and Expence; the Fruit of which, you have, in Part, communicated in the&s;e Letters</P>

<P>Pad&s;tow is a large Town, and &s;tands on a very good Harbour for &s;uch Ship|ping as u&s;e that Coa&s;t, that is to &s;ay, for the Iri&s;h Trade: The Harbour is the Mouth of the River Camel, or Camal, which ri&s;ing at Camelford, runs down by Bodwyn to Wodbridge or Wardbridge, a large Stone Bridge of Eight Acres, or thereabouts, built by the general good Will of the Country Gentlemen? but at the Motion of a religious Man, named Lovibond, moved in mere Charity; the Pa&s;&s;age over the River there, before, be|ing very dangerous, and having been the Lo&s;s of &s;ome Lives, as well as Goods. The Pa&s;&s;age from this Town of Pad&s;tow to Ireland, is called, by Wri$ers, to be no more than Twenty-four Hours, but not ju&s;tly: It is true, that Pad&s;tow being the fir&s;t, and be&s;t, if not the only Haven on this Shore, the Trade from Ireland &s;ettled here of Cour&s;e, and a great many Ships in this Harbour, are imploy'd in the Commerce; but to &s;ay, they make the Voyage in Four and Twenty Hours, is to &s;ay, it has been &s;o, or, on extraordinary Gales of fair Wind, it may be done; but not One in Twenty four Ships makes its Voyage in twenty four Hours; and, I believe, it may be &s;aid, they are oftener Five or Six Days in the Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>A little way with in the Land S.

<P>As we are ju&s;t entered Devon&s;hire, as I &s;aid above, it &s;eems, at fir&s;t Sight a wild, barren poor Country; but we ride but a few Miles, 'till we find an Alterati|on in &s;everal Things: 1. More People; 2. Larger Towns; 3. The People all bu&s;y and in full Employ upon their Manufac|$ures.</P>
<P>At the uppermo&s;t, and extreme Part of the County, N. W. there runs a huge Promontory, a Mountain like Probo&s;cis, into the Sea, beyond all the Land on ei|ther Side, whether of Devon&s;hire, or of Cornwall. This they would fain have called Hercules's Promontory, and Mr. Cambden, in his Writing&punc; and his Map|maker al&s;o, calls it Herculis Promontori|um; but the hone&s;t Sailors, and after them, the plain Country People, call it&punc; in down right modern Engli&s;h&punc; Hartland Point, or, Hearty Point, from $he Town of Hartland, which &s;tands ju&s;t within the Shore, and is on the very utmo&s;t Edge of the County of Devon: It is a Market Town, though &s;o remote, and of good Re&s;ort too, the People coming to it out of Cornwall, as well as out of Devon|&s;hire; and particularly the Fi&s;her-Boats of Barn&s;table Biddiford, and other Towns on the Coa&s;t lying often under the Lee&punc; as they call it, of the&s;e Rocks, for Shel|ter from the S. W or S. E. Winds, the Seamen go on Shore here and &s;upply them&s;elves with Provi&s;ions; nor is the Town unconcerned in that gainful Fi&s;h|ing Trade, which is carried on for the Herrings on this Coa&s;t&punc; many Seamen and Fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els belonging to the Town.</P>
<P>From this Point or Promontory, the Land, falling away for &s;ome Miles, makes a Gulph or Bay, which, reachin g to the Head Land, or Point of Barn&s;table River or Haven, is called from thence, Barn|&s;table Bay; into this Bay, or at the W. E$d of this Bay, the Rivers Taw and Tower empty them&s;elves at one Mouth, that is to &s;ay, in one Channel; and it is very particular, that as two Rivers join in one Channel, &s;o here are two great Trading Towns in one Port, a thing which
<PB REF="168">
as it is not u&s;ual, &s;o I cannot &s;ay 'tis any Advantage to either of them; for it na|turally follows, that they rival one ano|ther, and le&s;&s;en both; whereas, had they been join'd together in one Town, or where it po&s;&s;ible to join them, they would make the mo&s;t con&s;ide able Town, or City rather, in all this Part of Eng|land.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Towns of Barn&s;table and Biddiford, or, as &s;ome write it, Bedi|ford; the fir&s;t of the&s;e is the Antient, the la&s;t the mo&s;t Flouri&s;hing; the Harbour or River is in its Entrance the &s;ame to both, and when they part, the Tower turning to the Right, or South We&s;t, and the Taw to the S E. yet they &s;eem to be both &s;o &s;afe, &s;o ea&s;y in the Chan|nel&punc; &s;o equally good with re&s;pect to Ship|ping, fo equi-di&s;tant from the Sea, and &s;o equally advantageous, that neither Town complains of the Bounty of the Sea to them, o$ their Situation by Land; and yet, of late Years, the Town of Bid|di&s;ord has flouri&s;hed, and the Town of Barn&s;table rather declin'd.</P>
<P>Biddiford is plea&s;ant, clean, well-built Town; the more antient Street which lies next the River, is very plea&s;ant, where is the Bridge, a very noble Key, and the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; this Part al&s;o is very well built and populous, and fr$nts the River for above three quarters of a Mile: But be&s;ides this, there is a new &s;pacious Street, which runs N. and S. or rather N. W. and S E. a great length, broad as the high Street of Exce&s;ter, well-built, and, which is more than all, well inhabited, with con&s;iderable and wealthy Merchants who trade to mo&s;t Porrs of the trading World.</P>
<P>Here, as is to be &s;een in almo&s;t all the Market Towns of Devon&s;hire, is a very large, well-built, and well-&s;ini&s;h'd Meet|ing hou&s;e, and, by the Multitude of eo|ple which I &s;aw come out of it, and the Appearance of them, I thought all the Town had gone thither, and began to enquire for the Church: But when I came to the Church, I found that al&s;o, large&punc; &s;pacious, and well filled too, and that with People of the be&s;t Fa&s;hion. The Per&s;on who officiates at the Meet|ing hou&s;es in this Town, I happened to have &s;ome Conver&s;ation with, and found him to be not only a learned Man, and Ma&s;ter of good Reading; but a mo&s;t ac|ceptable Gentlemanly Per&s;on, and one, who, contrary to our receiv'd Opinion of tho&s;e People, had not only good Learn|ing, and good Sen&s;e, but abundance of good Manners, and good Humour&punc; no|thing Soure, Cynical or Moro&s;e in him, and, in a Word, a very valuable Man: And as &s;uch a Character, always re$om|mends a Man to Men of Sen&s;e and good Breeding; &s;o I found this Gen$lem$n was very well received in the Place, even by tho&s;e who he differ'd from in Matters o$ Religion, and tho&s;e Differences did $word$ to as is u&s;ual, make any Breach in their conver&s;ing with him. His Name&punc; as I remember was Bartlet But this is a Digre&s;&s;ion: I wi&s;h I could &s;ay the like of all the re&s;t of his B$e$hren.</P>
<P>The Trade of this Town being very much in Fi&s;h as it is al&s;o of all the Towns on this Coa&s;t, I ob&s;erved here&punc; that &s;everal Ships were employ'd to $word$ to Leverpool, and up the River $word$ to Warrington, to fetch the Rock $word$ which is found in that County (and $word$ which I &s;hall &s;ay more in my $word$ $word$ tho&s;e Parts) which Rock Salt they b$i$g to Biddiford and Barn&s;table and he$e they di&s;&s;olve it into Brine in the Se$ W$|ter, joyning the &s;trength of two Bodies into one, and then boil it up again $word$ a new Salt, as the Dutch do by the French and Portugue&s;e Salt: This is ju$t|ly call'd Salt, and with this they $word$ their Herrings; and as this is a Trade which can be but of a few Years $word$ becau&s;e the Rock it&s;elf has not be$$ di&s;cover'd in England much above $word$ Years; &s;o the Difference in curing the Fi&s;h has been &s;uch, and it has &s;o recom|mended their Herrings in $o$$ign Mar|kets, that the Demand for them has co$|&s;iderably increa&s;ed, and con&s;equently $word$ Trade.</P>

Pa&s;&s;age over it is &s;o narrow, and they $re &s;o chary of it, that few Carriages $o over it; but as the Water ebbs quite $word$ of the River every low Water, $he Carts and Waggons go over the and with great Ea&s;e and Safety; the $word$ of the Bridge are beautiful and $word$ but as for &s;aying one of them $word$ big, that a Ship of 60 Tons may $word$ under it, &amp;c. as a la$e Author $word$ I leave that where I find it, for $word$ People of Bidiford to laugh at: If it $$d been &s;aid the Hull of &s;uch a Ship $ight pa&s;s under the Bridge, it $ight have been let go: But, as he &s;ays, may Sail under it, which mu&s;t &s;up|$&s;$ &s;ome or one of its Ma&s;ts &s;tanding $word$ this puts it pa&s;t all po&s;&s;ibility of $word$ at lea&s;t to tho&s;e who judge of &s;uch $word$ by Rules of Mechani&s;m, or by $word$ is to be &s;een in other parts of the $$rld, no &s;uch Thing being practicable $word$ at London Bridge, Roche&s;ter $word$ or even at York, where the $word$ Arch in England is &s;uppo&s;ed to $word$</P>

<P>Biddiford has a $ine Bridge over Tower or Tow$idge, &s;o $word$ $word$ very noble Bridge over the Taw, $hough not longer, is counted larger $word$ than the other.

<P>Biddiford has a greater Number $$rchants, Barn&s;table has a greater $word$ within Land, by its great $word$ for Iri&s;h Wooll and Yarn, &amp;c. with the Serge-Makers of Tiverton and Exce&s;ter, who come up hither to buy. So that, in a Word$ Barn&s;table, though it has lo&s;t Ground to Biddiford, yet, take it all in its Trade compleatly, is full as con&s;iderable as Biddiford&punc; only, that perhaps, it was formerly far &s;uperior to it, and the other has ri&s;en up to be a Match to it.</P>
<P>Barn&s;table is a large, &s;pacious, well|built Town, more populous than Biddi|ford, but not better built, and &s;tands lower; $$&s;omuch, that at high Water in Spring Tides, it is, as it were, &s;ur|rounded with Water; the Bridge here, was built by the generous Gift of one Stamford, a Citizen and Merchant of London, who, it &s;eems, was not a Na|tive of this Place, but by Trading here to his Gain, had Kindne&s;s enough for the the Town, to offer &s;uch a Benefaction to them as they enjoy the Benefit of to this Day.</P>
<P>The Bridge at Biddiford as above, was likewi&s;e a Gift: but was, as they &s;ay, done by C$$lections among the Clergy, by Grant of Indulgences and the like Church Management. But be it how it will&punc; both the Towns are in|finitely obliged to the Benefactors.</P>
<P>Behind Biddiford, that is as we come from Launce&s;ton, are &s;everal good Towns though I ob&s;erv'd that the Country was wild and barren; as Tavi&s;tock, belonging to the Hou&s;e of Bedford, and giving the Title of Marquis, to the el|de&s;t Son of that illu&s;trious Ducal Fami|ly; the Town of Torrington, on the &s;ame River Towridge that Biddiford &s;tands on; the Title of Earl of Torring|ton, was fir&s;t given to the late General Monk, Duke of Albemarle, in Honour, and for a Reward of his Loyalty, in re&s;toring King Charles II. and the Line being extinct in his Son, it was given by King William III. to Admiral Her|bert, who came over with him, and was immediately made Admiral of the Briti&s;h Fleet, to defend the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown in the Per&s;on of that Prince;

<P>Another Town in this part of the Country is Okehampton, vulgarly O|kington, a good Market Town, which gave Title of Baron to the Lord Mo|hun, and &s;ends two Members to Par|liament; it is a Manufacturing Town, as all the Towns this Way now are, and pretty rich; and having &s;aid this, I have &s;aid all, unle&s;s it be, that in the Records of Antiquity, it appears to have been much more con&s;iderable than it is now, having 92 Knights Fees belonging to it.

<P>A little above Barn&s;table, North-Ea&s;t upon the Coa&s;t, &s;tands a good Market and Port Town, call'd Ilfar Comb, a Town of good Trade, populous and rich, all which is owing to its having a very good Harbour and Road for Ships, and where Ships from Ireland often put in, when, in bad Weather, they cannot, without the extreme&s;t Hazard, run into the Mouth of the Taw, which they call Barn&s;table Water; and this is one Rea&s;on, which cau&s;es the Merchants at Barn&s;ta|ble, to do much of their Bu&s;ine&s;s at this Port of Ilfar-Comb.</P>
<P>Antiquity tells us long Stories, of the Danes landing on this Coa&s;t; of Hubba, the Dani&s;h King, being &s;lain here, that is at Kennith Ca&s;tle, between this Place and the Mouth of the Taw and Tow|ridge, and that the Place was call'd Hubbe&s;tow ever after, from the Bury|ing of this Prince there: All this may be true, for ought we know, but I could neither find or hear of this Ca&s;tle of Kennith, or Burial Place, Hubbe&s;tow or any thing of the Ruins or Remain of them in the Country, &s;o I &s;hall $word$ you no farther about them.</P>

<P>Leaving the Coa&s;t, we came, in our going Southward, to the great River Ex, or I&s;ca, which ri&s;es in the Hills on this North &s;ide of the $word$ and that &s;o far, as, like the Tamar, it be|gins within Four or Five Miles of the Severn Sea, the Country it ri&s;es i$, $word$ called Exmore, Cambden calls it a filthy barren Ground, and, indeed, &s;o it is&punc; but as &s;oon as the Ex comes off from the Moors, and hilly Country, and de|&s;cends into the lower Grounds, we $ound the Alteration; for then we &s;aw De|von&s;hire in its other Countenance, viz. Cultivated, Populous, and Fruitful; a$d continuing &s;o till we came to Tiver|ton, a Town which I mention'd before, but did not fully de&s;cribe</P>
<P>Next to Exce&s;ter, this is the greate&s;t manufacturing Town in the County, and, of all the inland Towns, is next to it in Wealth, and in Numbers of Peo|ple; it &s;tands on the River $word$ $word$ has over it, a very fine Bridge, with another over the little River $word$ which, immediately after, falls into the Ex ju&s;t before the Town: An$$quity &s;ays, before tho&s;e Bridges were built, there were two Fords here, one through each River, and that the Town was from thence called Twyford-ton, that is, the Town upon the two Fords, and &s;o by abbreviating the Sounds Twy|&s;or ton, then Tiverton; but that I leave to the learned Searchers into an|tient Things.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of Tiverton is the Free-School, at the Ea&s;t Entrance into
<PB REF="171">
the Town, a noble Building, but a much nobler Foundation; it was erected by one Peter Blundel, a Clothier and a Lover of Learning, who u&s;ed the &s;aying of William of Wickham to the King when he found|ed the Royal School at Winche&s;ter, viz. That if he was not him&s;elf a Scholar, he would be the Occa&s;ion of making more Scholars, than any Scholar in England; to which End he founded this School: He has endowed it with &s;o liberal a Main|tenance, that, as I was informed, the School-ma&s;ter has, at lea&s;t, Sixty Pounds per Annum, be&s;ides a very good Hou&s;e to live in, and the Advantage of Scholars not on the Foundation, and the U&s;her in Proportion; and to this he added Two Fellow&s;hips, and Two Scholar&s;hips, which he gave the Maintenance for to Sydney College in Cambridge, and one Fellow|&s;hip, and Two Scholar&s;hips, to Baliol-Col|lege in Oxford, all which are appointed for the Scholars bred up in this School, and the pre&s;ent reverend Ma&s;ter, was a Scholar upon the Foundation in the &s;ame School.</P>
<P>As this is a manufacturing Country, as above, we found the People, here, all ful|ly employ'd, and very few, if any, out of Work, except &s;uch as need not be un|employ'd, but were &s;o from mere Sloth and Idlene&s;s, of which, &s;ome will be found every where.</P>
<P>From this Town, there is little belong|ing to Devon&s;hire, but what has been &s;poken of, except what lies in the Road to T$unton, which we took next, where we meet with the River Columb, a River ri&s;ing al&s;o in the utmo&s;t Limits of the Shire towards Somer&s;et&s;hire, and giving Name to &s;o many Towns on its Banks, as leaves no Room to doubt of its one Name being right, &s;uch as Columb David's, Ufcolumbe, Colum&s;tock, and Columbron; the la&s;t is a Market Town, and they are all full of Manufacturers, depending much on the Ma&s;ter Manufacturers of Tiver|ton.</P>
<P>With this Town, we leave the County of Devon, and entering Somer&s;et&s;hire, have really a Ta&s;te of a different Country from Devon&s;hire; for entering Willing|ton, the fir&s;t Town we came at in Somer|&s;et&s;hire, though partly employ'd in manu|facturing too, we were immediately &s;ur|rounded with Beggars, to &s;uch a Degree, that we had &s;ome Difficulty to keep them from under our Hor&s;e Heels.</P>
<P>It was our Misfortune at fir&s;t, that we threw &s;ome Farthings, and Halfpence, &s;uch as they had, among them; for thinking by this to be rid of them, on the con|trary, it brought out &s;uch a Croud of them, as if the whole Town was come out into the Street, and they r$n in this Manner after us through the whole Street, and a great way after we were quite out of the Town; &s;o that we were glad to ride as fa&s;t as we could through the Town to get clear of them; I was, indeed, a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch a Sight, in a Country where the People were &s;o generally full of Work, as they were here; for in Corn: wall, where there are hardly any Manu|facturers, and where there are, indeed, abundance of Poor, yet we never found any thing like this.</P>
<P>Before I quite leave Devon&s;hire, I mu&s;t mention one Thing, which I ob&s;erved at my fir&s;t &s;etting out; namely, That I would take Notice how every County in England furni&s;h'd &s;omething of its Pro|duce towards the Supply of the City of London: Now I mu&s;t allow, that Corn|wall is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, an Exception to this Rule, becau&s;e, though it is fruitful enough for the Supply of its own Inha|bitants, yet, in the fir&s;t Place, the wa&s;te Grounds are &s;o many, the Inhabitants &s;o numerous, and the County &s;o narrow, that, except the Herrings, a few of which may be brought to London for Sale, they have not much Overplus to furni&s;h other Parts with; but then they make us A|mends by &s;ending up an immen&s;e Wealth in their Tin, Lead, and Copper, from the Bowels of their barren Mountains, and the Export of the Pilchards, and Herrings, from both their Shores to Spain and Italy, from whence much of the Re|turns are again brought to London for their Vent and Con&s;umption.</P>
<P><PB REF="172">
In like Manner, the County of Devon has been rich in Mines of Tin and Lead, though they &s;eem at pre&s;ent, wrought out; and they had their Stannary Towns and Coinage, as well as in Cornwall; nay, &s;o numerous were the Miners or Tinners, as they are called in this Coun|ty, that they were, on occa&s;ion of a Na|tional Mu&s;ter, or Defence, regimented by them&s;elves, arm'd, and officer'd by them&s;elves, and were, in &s;hort, a &s;eparate Militia from the Trained Bands, or Mili|tia of the County; but now we &s;ee the Tin Works in Devon&s;hire is quite laid a|&s;ide, not One Tin Mine being at work in the whole County; There are, indeed, &s;ome Copper&punc;works undertaken on the North Side, as we were told; but I do not find, that they are yet brought to any Perfection, and about Ilfarcomb, Comb Mertin, al&s;o at Delverton, in the North Part of the County, they have been at Work to &s;ee if they can recover &s;ome Sil|ver Mines, which, in the Time of King Edward III. were &s;o large, that they em|ployed Three hundred Miners, be&s;ides other Workmen, and brought that Prince great Sums of Money for the carrying on his Wars again&s;t France: What Pro+gre&s;s they are now like to make in it, I cannot yet learn.</P>
<P>But there is one Article in the Produce of Devon&s;hire, which makes good what I have written before, That every Coun|ty contributes &s;omething towards the Sup|ply of London; and this is, the Cyder which I have mentioned already, and which takes up the South Part of the Coun|ty, between Top&s;ham and Axmen&s;ter, where they have &s;o va&s;t a Quantity of Fruit, and &s;o much Cyder made, that &s;ometimes they have &s;ent Ten, or Twen|ty thou&s;and Hog&s;heads of it in a Year to London, and at a very rea&s;onable rate too.</P>
<P>The County of Somer&s;et joins to the N. W. Part of Devon&s;hire. I touched only upon One Point of the County in my la&s;t, as I went We&s;t. The whole County is worth a more particular Ac|count, than can be given within the Space of a Letter.</P>
<P>I entered the County, as I ob&s;erved a|bove, by Wellington, where we had the Entertainment of the Beggars, from whence we came to Taunton, vulgarly cal|led Taunton Dean upon the River Ton, this is a large, wealthy, and exceedingly populous, Town: One of the chief Ma|nufacturers of the Town told us, That there was at that Time &s;o good a T$ade in the Town, that they had then eleven hundred Looms going for the weaving of Sagathies Du Roys, and &s;uch kind of Stuffs, which are made there; and that which added to the Thing very much, was, that not one of tho&s;e Looms want|ed Work: He farther added, That there was not a Child in the Town, or in the Villages round it, of above Five Years old, but, if it was not neglected by its Parents, and untaught, could earn its own Bread. This was what I never met with in any Place in England, except at Col|che&s;ter in E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>This Town choo&s;es Two Members of Parliament, and their Way of choo&s;ing is, by tho&s;e who they call Pot-Walloners, that is to &s;ay, Every Inhabitant, whether Hou&s;e-keeper or Lodger, that dre&s;&s;es their own Victuals; to make out which, &s;everal Iumares, or Lodgers, will, &s;ometime be|fore the Election, bring out their Pots, and make Fires in the Street, and boil their Victuals in the &s;ight of their Neigh|bours, that their Votes may not be cal|led in Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>There are Two large Pari&s;h Churches in this Town, and Two or Three Meet|ing-Hou&s;es, whereof one, is &s;aid to be the large&s;t in the County: The Inhabi|tants have been noted for the Number of Di&s;&s;enters; for among them it was al|ways counted a Seminary of &s;uch: They &s;uffered deeply in the Duke of Mon|mouth's Rebellion, but paid K. James home for the Cruelty exerci&s;ed by Jef|fries among them; for when the Prince of Orange arrived, the whole Town $word$ in to him, with &s;o univer&s;al a Joy, that
<PB REF="173">
'twas thought, if he had wanted it, he might have rai&s;ed a little Army there, and in the adjacent Part of the Coun|try.</P>
<P>There was, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, is &s;till, a private College, or Academy, for the Di&s;&s;enters in this Town; the Tntor, who then managed it, was named Warren, who told me, that there were Three|&s;core and Twelve Mini&s;ters then Preach|ing, whereof Six had conformed to the Church, the re&s;t were among the Di&s;|&s;enters, who had been his Scholars, whereupon, One of his own Sort had, it $eems, &s;tiled him the Father of the Faithful: The Academy, &s;ince his Death, is continued, but not kept up to the Degree it was, in the Days of the &s;aid Mr. Warren.</P>
<P>From this Town of Taunton, which is by far the greate$t $word$ all this Part of the Country, and $word$ more People in it than the City of York, we went North to take a View of the Coa&s;t. $$$ere, of which mention was made $word$ where the River EX ri&s;es, lies $n the Way, Part of it in this Country, $span$ to the Sea Side: It gives, $span$ a melancholy View, being a $span$ of barren, and de&s;olate Lands; $span$ the Coa&s;t, there are &s;ome very o$ Sea Ports. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Porlock, on the very utmo&s;t Extent $f the Country; it has a &s;mall Harbour, $ut $f no Importance, nor has it any thing of Trade, &s;o I need but name it.</P>
<P>Mi$chead, the be&s;t Port, and &s;afe&s;t $$bour, in all the&s;e Counties, at lea&s;t, a this Side: No Ship is &s;o big, but it ay come in, and no Weather &s;o bad, it the Ships are &s;afe when they are $ and they told me, that in the great $orm Anno 1703. when in all the Har|$rs and Rivers in the County, the Ships $re blown on Shore, wreck'd, and lo&s;t, $y &s;uffered little or no Damage in this $$$our.</P>
<P>The Trade of this Town lies chiefly $word$ Ireland, and this was, for many ars, the chief Port in this Part of England, where Wool from Ireland was allowed to be imported; but that Liber|ty is &s;ince inlarged to &s;everal other Ports by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>This Corporation &s;ends Two Members to the Parliament, which are cho&s;en al|&s;o, as at Taunton, by the Pot Wallon|ers; the Town is well built, is full of rich Merchants, and has &s;ome Trade al&s;o to Virginia, and the We&s;t-Indies: They corre&s;pond much with the Merchants of Baru&s;table, and Bri&s;tol, in their Foreign Trade.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome very good Families, and of very ancient &s;tanding, in this part of the County, among which, the Fami|lies of Seymour, of Portman, of Or|chard, Wyndham, Popham of Welling|ton, Mallet, an ancient Family of Nor|man Extraction, Mohun, Beauchamp, and &s;ome others, are mo&s;t eminent; the Mo|huns in particular were anciently Lords of Dun&s;tar Ca&s;tle, at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from the Sea, and very &s;trong. Here former|ly was the ancient Man&s;ion, or Inheri|tance, of the Lords Mohun, who, as a|bove, long enjoy'd it: Who it will now de&s;cend to, that ancient Family being ex|tinct in the Per&s;on of the late unhappy Lord Mohun, who was kill'd in a Du$$ with Duke Hamilton, I could not learn</P>
<P>From hence the Coa&s;t bear back Wed to Watchet, a &s;mall Port al&s;o, but of no Importance, that is to &s;ay, 'tis of no Im|portance now; for if we may calculate Things pre&s;ent, by Things pa&s;t, the Towns of Porlock and Watchet, which were once important Places; and the Rea&s;on is clear, &s;ince the Increa&s;e of Shipping and Trade, and the Improve|ment of the navigating Skill, bigger Ships being brought into U&s;e, than were for|merly built; acordingly, larger Ports, and deeper Water, were requi&s;ite to la|bour &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els, than would &s;erve for that Purpo&s;e before; and the Harbour at Minchead being fairer, and much deeper, than tho&s;e at Watchet and Porlock, and therefore able to &s;ecure tho&s;e grea$|er Ships, which the others were not,
<PB REF="174">
the Merchants removed to it; and thus, in Time, the Town grew up, to what we now find it to be.</P>
<P>From hence the winding Shore brings us to Bridgewater. This is an ancient and very con&s;iderable Town and Port, it &s;tands at the Mouth of the River Par|rat, or Perot, which comes from the South, after having received the River Tone from the We&s;t, which is made na|vigable up to Taunton, by a very fine Channel, cut at the Expence of the Peo|ple of Taunton, and which, by the Na|vigation of it, is infinitely advantageous to that town and well worth all their Expence, fir&s;t by bringing up Coals, which are brought from Swanzey in Wales by Sea to Bridgewater, and thence by Barges up this River to Taunton; al&s;o for bringing all heavy Goods and Merchandizes from Bri&s;tol, &s;uch as Iron, Lead, Oyl, Wine, Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tar, Grocery, and Dye Stuffs, and the like; their Tobacco they generally re|ceived from Barn&s;table by Land, which is about &s;ixteen Miles We&s;t.</P>
<P>This Town of Bridgewater, is a po|pulous, trading Town, is well built, and as well inhabited, and has many Fami|lies of good Fa&s;hion dwelling in it, be|&s;ides Merchants. The famous Admiral Blake, was a Native of this Town. Here it was, that the Duke of Monmouth, finding him&s;elf defeated in his Expecta|tion of the City of Bri&s;tol, and repuls'd at the City of Bath, and pre&s;s'd by the Approach of the King's Troops, who endeavou$'d to &s;urround him, made his Retreat; where, finding the King's Troops followed him, and &s;eem'd re&s;olved to attack him, he went up to the Top of the Steeple, with &s;ome of his Officers, and viewing the Situation of the King's Army, by the Help of Per&s;pectives, re&s;olved to make an Attempt upon them the &s;ame Night, by way of Prevention, and accordingly march'd out of the Town in the Dead of the Night to at|tack them, and had he not, either by the Treachery, or Mi&s;take of his Guides, been brought to an unpa&s;&s;able Ditch, where he could not get over, in the In|terval of which, the King's Troops took the Alarm, by the firing a Pi&s;tol among the Duke's Men, whether, al&s;o, by Ac|cident, or Treachery, was not known; I &s;ay, had not tho&s;e Accidents, and his own Fate, con&s;pired to his Defeat, he had certainly cut the Lord Fever&s;ham's Army (for he commanded them) all to Pieces; but by the&s;e Circum&s;tances, he was brought to a Battle on unequal terms, and defeated: the re&s;t I need not mention.</P>
<P>This Town was regularly fortified in the late Civil Wars, and &s;u&s;tain'd two &s;ieges, if not more; the &s;ituation of it renders it ea&s;iy to be fortified, the River and Haven taking one chief Part of the Circumference; over the River, they have a very good Bridge of &s;tone, and the tide ri&s;es here, at High Water, near &s;ix Fathoms, whereof, &s;ometimes it comes in with &s;uch furious Ha&s;te, as to come two Fathoms deep at a time, and when it does &s;o, by &s;urprize, it often does great damage to &s;hips, driving them foul of one ano|ther, and oftentimes over&s;etting them. This &s;udden Rage of the Tide, is called, the Boar, and is frequent in all the Ri|vers of this Channel, e&s;pecially in the Severn it&s;elf; 'tis al&s;o known in the North, particularly in the Trent, and the Oule, at their Entrance into Humber, and &s;everal other Places.</P>
<P>In this Town of Bridgewater, be&s;ides a very large Church, there is a fine new&punc; built Meeting hou&s;e, that is to &s;ay, built &s;ince the Toleration, in which 'tis remark|able, that they have an advanc'd Seat for the Mayor and Aldermen, when any of the Magi&s;trates &s;hould be of their Com|munion, as &s;ometimes has happened. Here, al&s;o, is a College, or private A|cademy, for the Di&s;&s;enters to breed up their preaching Youth; the Tutor was one Mr. Moor, a Man who it is own'd, was a ma&s;ter of Learning, that makes a good In&s;tructor of others, as I &s;hall ob|&s;erve on &s;ome other Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>From Bridgewater, there is a Road to Bri&s;tol, which they call the Lower Way&punc; the Upper Way, and which is the more
<PB REF="175">
frequented Road, being over Mendip hills. This Lower Way al&s;o is not always pa&s;|&s;able, being &s;ubject to Floods, and dan|gerous Inundations, I mean, dangerous to travel through, e&s;pecially for Strangers: All this Part of the Country, viz. be|tween Bridgewater, and the Sea, and on Northward upon the Coa&s;t, lies low, and is wholly imployed in breeding and feed|ing of Cattle, as are al&s;o the Moors, or Mar&s;h Grounds, which extend them&s;elves up the Rivers Perrot, and Ivill, into the Heart of the Country; of which in its Place.</P>
<P>This Low Part of the Country, be|tween Bridge-water and Bri&s;tol, &s;uffered exceedingly in that terrible Inundation of the Sea, which was occa&s;ioned by the Vio|lence of the Wind in the great Storm, Anno 1703. and the Country People have &s;et up marks upon their Hou&s;es and Trees, with this Note upon them, Thus high the Waters came in the great Storm: Thus far the great Tide flowed up in the la&s;t violent Tempe&s;t, and the like.</P>
<P>And in one Place they &s;hewed us, where a Ship was, by the Force of the Water, and the Rage of the Tempe&s;t, driven up upon the Shore, &s;everal hund|red Yards from the ordinary high Water Mark, and was left in that &s;urprizing Con|dition upon dry Land.</P>
<P>As this Country is all a grazing, rich, feeding Soil, &s;o a great Number of large Oxen are fed here, which are &s;ent up to London; &s;o that now we come into the Reach of my former Ob&s;ervation, viz. That every County furni&s;hes &s;omething for the Supply of London, and no County in England furni&s;hes more effectual Pro|vi&s;ions, nor, in Proportion, a greater value than this. The&s;e Supplies are in Three Articles.</P>
<P N="1">1. Far Oxen (as above) as large, and good, as any in England.</P>
<P N="2">2. Large Cheddar Chee&s;e, the greate&s;t, and be&s;t of kind in England.</P>
<P N="3">3. Colts bred in great Numbers in the Moors, and &s;old into the Northern Coun|ties, where the Hor&s;e Copers, as they are called, in Stafford&s;hire, and Leice&s;ter&s;hire, buy them again and fell them at London for Carr Hor&s;es, and Coach Hor&s;es, the Breed being very large.</P>
<P>As the low Part of this County is thus imployed in grazing and feeding Cattle&punc; &s;o all the re&s;t of this large extending Country is imployed in the Woollen Ma|nufactures, and in the be&s;t, and mo&s;t pro|fitable Part of it, viz.</P>
<P>In Taunton, The Serges, Druggets, &amp;c. and &s;everal other kinds of Stuffs.</P>
<P>In Wells, Shepton, Gla&s;tenbury, &amp;c. Knitting of Stockings, principally for the Spani&s;h Trade.</P>
<P>In Bri&s;tol, and many Towns on the Somer&s;et&s;hire $ de&mdash;Druggets Canta|loons, and other Stuffs.</P>
<P>In Froom, Philips-Norton, and all the Country bordering upon Wilt&s;hire, Fine Spani&s;h Medley Cloths, e&s;pecially on that Part of the County from Wincanton, and Meer, to Warmin&s;ter, Bruton, Ca&s;tlecary, Temple Comb, down to Gillingham, and Shaftsbury, in Dor&s;et&s;hire.</P>
<P>I mention this at lage, becau&s;e this Trade of fine Spani&s;h Medley Cloth, be|ing the mix'd Colours and Cloths, with which all the Gentlemen and Per&s;ons of any Fa&s;hion in England, are clothed, and va&s;t Quantities of which are exported to all Parts of Europe, is &s;o very con&s;ider|able, &s;o va&s;t an Advantage to England, maintains and &s;upports &s;o many poor Fa|milies, and makes &s;o many rich ones, that no Man can be ju&s;t in the De&s;cripti|on of Things, and in a Sarv$y of this Part of England, and nor enter into a parti|cular De&s;cription of it; the above you may take as an Introduction to it, only I &s;hall add but a little more, concerning this County of Some$&s;et, and &s;hall, upon my entering into the North we&s;t and We&s;t Parts of W$l$&s;hire, where the Center of this Prodigy of a Trade is &s;um it all up together, and $hew you the Extent of Land which it &s;preads it&s;elf upon, and give you Room, at lea&s;t, to make &s;ome

Gue&s;s at the Numbers of poor People, who are &s;u&s;tain'd and inrich'd by it.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t fir&s;t go back again a little while into Somer&s;et&s;hire: The Northern Part of the County, I did not vi&s;it in this Journey, which, as I hinted before, is only a Return from my long Travel to the Land's End. In omitting this Part, I, of cour&s;e, leave the Two Cities of Bri&s;tol and Bath, and that high Part of the Country called Mendip Hall, to my next We&s;tern Journey, which will in|clude all the Counties due We&s;t from London; for the&s;e now &s;poken of&punc; though ordinarily called the We&s;t Country, are rather N. W. than We&s;t.</P>
<P>But as I made a little Trip from Bridgewater North, into the Body of the County, I mu&s;t take Notice of what I ob&s;erved in that Part of it: The fir&s;t Place I came to was Gla&s;tonbury, where, indeed, the venerable Marks of Antiquity, however I have declin'd the Ob&s;ervation of them, &s;truck me with &s;ome unu&s;ual Awe, and I re&s;olved to hear all that could be told me upon that Subject; and fir&s;t they told me (for there are two Piecee of Antiquiry, which were to be inquired of in this Place) that K. Arthur was buried here, and that his Coffin had been found here.</P>
<P>Secondly, That Jo&s;eph of Arimathea was here, and that when he fix'd his Staff in the Ground, which was on Chri&s;tmas Day, it immediately took Root, budded, put forth White thorn Leaves, and the next Day, was in full Blo&s;&s;om, white as a Sheet, and that the Plant is pre&s;erved, and blows eve|ry Chri&s;tmas Day, as at fir&s;t, to this very Day.</P>
<P>I took all this <HI>ad Re&s;erendum,</HI> but took Guides afterward, to &s;ee what De|mon&s;trations there could be given of all the&s;e Things; they went over the Ru|ins of the Place with me, telling me, which Part every particular Piece of Building had been; and as for the White|thorn, they carried me to a Gentleman's Garden in the Town, where it was pre|&s;erved, and I brought a Piece of it away in my Hat, but took it upon their Hon|our, that it really does blow in &s;uch Manner, as above, on Chri&s;tmas Day. However it mu&s;t be confs&s;s'd, that it is univer&s;ally atte&s;ted.</P>
<P>Where I had the &s;ight of the White|thorn Tree, I obtained a &s;ight of Mr. Cambden, and his Continuator, and was, fir&s;t, a little concern'd, that a Per&s;on of Mr. Cambden's Judgment, gave &s;uch an Account of the Legendary Part of the Hi&s;tory of this Place, with a Ta&s;te of his crediting the whole Story; and from him I began to believe al&s;o, that Jo&s;eph of Arimathea, was really here, and that the Chri&s;tian Religion was preached in this I&s;land within 37 Years after the death of our Saviour.</P>
<P>This, however, prompted me to far|ther Inquiry, and the following Account occur'd, which is to be found, as they &s;ay, in the Manu&s;cript Hi&s;tory of the Church of Gla&s;tenbury, now depo&s;ited in the Cottonian Library, and taken from it by Mr. Dugdale, in his Mona|&s;ticon. Fol. 1, 2.</P>

<P>IN the Year 31 after the Pa&s;&s;ion of our Lord, Twelve of St. Philip the Apo&s;tle's Di&s;ciples (the chief of whom was Jo&s;eph of Arimathea) came into this Country, and Preached the Chri&s;|tian Faith to Arviragus, who refu&s;ed to embrace it, and yet granted them this Place, with Twelve Hides of Land; where they made Walls of Wattles, and erected the fir&s;t Church in this King|dom, which Chri&s;t per&s;onally dedicated to the Honour of his Mother, and the Place for Burial of his Servants, as is &s;aid in the Manu&s;cript Hi&s;tory of the Mona&s;tery of Gla&s;tonbury in the Cot|ton Library. The&s;e Twelve, and their Succe&s;&s;ors, continuing long the &s;ame Number, and leading an er$m$tical Life, converted a great Multitude of Pagans to the Faith of Chri&s;t.

holy Men Phaganus and Diruvianus, co|ming into the&s;e Parts, and baptizing King Lucius and his People, had the a|fore&s;aid Hides confirm'd to them and their Succe&s;&s;ors, the &s;ame Number of Twelve being kept up till the coming of St. Patrick, who in&s;tructing them in the Mona&s;tical Life, became their Abbot: After whom, the holy Fathers Benignus Kolumkil, and Gildas, led a mo&s;t holy Life there. Next came St. David Arch|bi&s;hop of Menevia, now called St. Da|vid's, who added a new Chapel to the Church, dedicating it to the ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin, and erected a rich Altar; and near the &s;aid Chapel, Jo&s;eph of Arimethea, and other holy Men, are &s;aid to have been buried. Tho' the Church was af|terwards &s;everal Times rebuilt, this Place &s;till remained under the former Con&s;ecration, and was held in &s;uch Ve|neration, that Kings, Bi&s;hops, and all the greate&s;t Per&s;ons, thought them&s;elves happy in adding &s;omething to its Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, or being buried with any &s;mall Parcel of its Earth. St. Dun&s;tan, and other holy Abbots, always pre&s;erving the Number of Twelve Monks added to them &s;everal Clergymen, that &s;ung well.</P>
<P>This Church, by Rea&s;on of its An|tiquity, was by the Engli&s;h called Eald|church, that is, Old Church; and the People of the Country about it, thought no Oath more &s;acred, than to &s;wear by the Old Church; as being the fir&s;t, and olde&s;t Church in England, and held in &s;uch Veneration, that it was called a &s;econd Rome, for Sanctity; becau&s;e, as Rome was honoured with a Multitude of Martyrs, &s;o this Place was renowned for many Confe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, in which this Church &s;tands, was, by the Britons, fir&s;t called Y$$wyrtryn, that is, the Gla&s;s I&s;land, by Rea&s;on of the River, as it were of the Colour of Gla&s;s, incompa&s;&s;ing the Mar&s;h. It was called an I&s;land, becau&s;e inclo&s;ed about by a deep Mar&s;h. It was called Avallonia, either from the Briti&s;h Word Aval, &s;ignifying an Apple, as be|ing full of Fruit Trees, or from Aval|lon, who was once Lord of that Ter|ritory. The Saxons gave it the Name of Gla&s;tingebury, that is, the Town of Gla&s;s. There are &s;everal I&s;lands about this, all belonging to it, all which toge|ther were reduced to make up the Twelve Hides above-mentioned&punc; the Bounds whereof may be &s;een in Dug|dale, p. 2. and 3. All the Places with|in tho&s;e Bounds enjoy all &s;orts of Im|munities, from the fir&s;t Times of Chri&s;|tianity, granted and confirmed to the Church of Gla&s;tonbury by the Briti&s;h, Engli&s;h, and Norman Kings.</P>

<P>Many Holy Relicks were al&s;o pre&s;erved in this Church. Of tho&s;e relating to the Old Te&s;tament, Part of Rachel's Tomb; of the Altar on which Mo&s;es pour'd out Oyl; of his Book; of the Tomb of I&s;aiah; &s;ome Manna: Relicks of the Prophet Daniel; of the three Children delivered from the Fiery Furnace; &s;ix gilt Stones of the Pavement of the Temple, and &s;ome of the Gate.

<P>On this Account, Gla&s;tonbury was eve|ry where held in the greate&s;t Veneration; and, as has been &s;aid, the greate&s;t Per|&s;ous coveted to be buried there; mo&s;t of who&s;e Names have been lo&s;t, and of &s;ome, mention has been made above.</P>
<P>A few Feet from the Old Church &s;tood Two Pyramids; that next to the Church Twenty-&s;ix Feet high, on which were many Antiquities worn out by Age. On the uppermo&s;t Story of it, was a Ponti|fical Image; on the Second, the Image of a King, with the&s;e Letters, Heri, Sexi, and Bli&s;ier; on the Third, were the&s;e Words, Wemere&s;t, Bantomp, Wineweng on the Fourth. Hate, Wulfred, and Eam|fled; on the Fifth, and lowe&s;t, an Image, and this In&s;cription, Logior, We&s;licas, Bregden, Swelves, Hwingendes, Bera. The other Pyramid was Eighteen Feet high, and had Four Stages, on which was to be read, Hedde Bi&s;hop Bregored, and Breorward. What the&s;e Words &s;ignify is not known; but it is gue&s;s'd, they were the Names of the Per&s;ons depo&s;ited with|in the Pyramid. So great was the Re&s;pect paid by our Ance&s;tors to this Place, that they dur&s;t not utter any idle Words, nor &s;o much as &s;pit in the Church, or Church|yard, unle&s;s compelled by the utmo&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity, and even then with the utmo&s;t Reluctancy and Remor&s;e: Neither dur&s;t any Man bring a Hawk, Hor&s;e, or Dog into the Church, becau&s;e it had been often ob&s;erved, that &s;uch as had been acciden|tally brought in, immediately died. Even from foreign Countries the Earth of this Church yard was &s;ent for, to bury with the greate&s;t Per&s;ons; and it is reported, that even a Mahometan Sultan, having taken an Engli&s;h Gentleman in the holy Land, gave him his Liberty, upon Pro|mi&s;e, that he would bring him a Gantlet full of that Earth, which was accord|ingly performed, and the Gentleman re|turning to Gla&s;tonbury, declared the &s;ame upon Oath.</P>
<P>As to the Burial of King Arthur, Mr. Cambden makes no doubt of it, and gives us from Giraldus Cambren&s;is, an Account how King Henry II. cau&s;ed Search to be made for his Tomb, and before they had dug Seven Foot, they came to a great Stone, having a Cro&s;s of Lead on the In&s;ide of it, and the &s;ub&s;equent Letters, or In&s;cription upon it, and in the follow|ing rude Character; which the &s;aid Gir|al$us Cambren&s;is, Mr Cumbden &s;ays, was an Eye Witne&s;s of as well as of a Coffin of hollow'd Oak, which they &s;ound by digging Nine Foot deeper than the In&s;cription, wherein were depo&s;$$d the Bones of that ga$at Prince,</P>
<P><PB REF="179">
On the Top of a high Hill, near a Mile from the Town, &s;tands an old Tower, which the People vulgarly call the Torr; what it was, we are not certain; but it made famous by one Thing in particular; that here King Henry VIII. cau&s;ed Rich. Whitingus, the la&s;t Abbot of Gla&s;tonbury, to be hanged for refu&s;ing to &s;urrender the Mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I cannot &s;o much blame the Catholicks in tho&s;e early Days, for reverencing this Place as they, or, at lea&s;t, 'till they came to found Idolatry up|on their Re&s;pect, if they really belief the&s;e Things; but my Bu&s;ine&s;s is to relate, ra|ther than Remark.</P>
<P>Four Miles from Gla&s;tonbury, lies the little City of Wells, where is one of one of the neare&s;t, and, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, the mo&s;t beautiful, Cathedrals in complete Draught of Imagery, very fine, and yet very antient.</P>
<P>This is a neat, clean City, and the Clergy, in particular, live very hand&s;om|$y; the Clo&s;s, or Part of the City, where $he Bi&s;hop's Palace is, is very properly $alled &s;o; for it is walled in, and lock'd $p like a little Fortification, and has a $$tch round it.</P>
<P>The dignified Clergy live in the In&s;ide of it, and the Prebendaries, and Canons which are very numerous, have very a|$$ble Dwellings, and live very plea&s;ant|$. Here are no le&s;s than Seven and $wenty Prebends, and Nineteen Canons, $longing to this Church, be&s;ides a Dean, Chancellor, a Pr$$$utor, and Three $ch $eacons; a Number which very $word$ Cathedrals in England have, be&s;ides $s.</P>
<P>Dag$ale, in his Mona&s;ticon, tells us $t the Church of Wells has given to the $gdom, One Cardinal, Six High Chan|$ors, Five high Trea&s;urers, one Lord Pri|$ Seal, One Lord Pre&s;ident of Wales, $word$ Secretary of State, all of them Bi&s;hops this Dioce&s;s; the County is the Dio|$, and contains Three hundred Eeigh|$ight Pari&s;hes, and the Arch Deaconries of Wells, Bath, and Taunton.</P>
<P>The City lies ju&s;t at the Foot of the Mountains called Mendip Hills, and is it|&s;elf built on a Stony Foundation. Its Manufacture is chiefly of Stocking, as is mentioned already; 'tis well built, and po|pulous, and has &s;everal good Families in it; &s;o that there is no Want of good Company there.</P>
<P>Near this City, and ju&s;t under the Hills, is the famous, and &s;o much talk'd of Wo|key Hole, which, to me, that had been in Pool's Hole, in the Peak of Derby, has nothing of Wonder o$ Curio&s;ity in it; the chief Thing I ob&s;erv'd in th s, is, what is generally found in all &s;uch &s;ub$erran$ous Caverns; namely, That the Water drop|ping from the Roof of the Vault, petri|fies, and hangs in long Pieces like I$icies as if it would, in Time, turn into a Co|lumn to &s;upport the Arch, As to the Stories of a Witch dwelling here, as of a Gyant dwelling in the other (I mean in Pool's Hole) I take them to be equally fabulous, and worth no Notice.</P>
<P>In the low Country, on the other Side Mendip Hills, lies Chedde a Village plea|&s;antly &s;ituated under the very Ridge of the Mountains; before the Village is a large Green, or Common, a Piece of Ground, in which the whole herd of the the Cows, belonging to the Town, do feed; the Ground is exceeding rich, and as the whole Village are Cow-keepers, they take care to keep up the Goodne&s;s of the Soil by agreeing to lay on large Quantities of Dung for manuring and in|$iching the Land.</P>
<P>The Milk of all the Town Cows, is brought together every Day into a com|mon Room, where the Per&s;ons appoint|ed, or tru&s;ted for the management, mea&s;ure every Man's Quantity, and &s;et it down in a Book; when the Quantities are ad|ju&s;ted, the Milk is all put together, and every meal's Milk makes one Chee&s;e, and no more; &s;o that the Chee&s;e is bigger, or le&s;s, as the Cows yield more, or le&s;s, Milk. By this method, the goodne&s;s of the Chee&s;e is pre&s;erved, and, without all Di&s;pute, it is the be&s;t Chee&s;e that England
<PB REF="180">
affords, if not, that the whole World af|fords.</P>
<P>As the Chee&s;es are, by this means, ve|ry l$$ge for they often weigh a Hundred Weight&punc; &s;ometimes much more, &s;o the poorer Inhabitants, who have but few Cows, are obliged to &s;tay the longer for the Return of their milk; for no Man has any &s;uch Return, 'till his Share comes to a whole Chee&s;e, and then he has it; and if the Quantity of his Milk deliver|ed in, comes to above a Chee&s;e, the over|plus re&s;ts in Account to his Credit, 'till another Chee&s;e comes to his &s;hare; and thus every Man has equal Ju&s;tice, and though he &s;hould have but one Cow, he &s;hall, in Time, have one whole Chee&s;e. This Chee&s;e is often &s;old for &s;ix Pence to eight Pence per Pound, when the Che|&s;h$re Chee&s;e is &s;old but for two Pence to two Pence Halfpenny.</P>
<P>Here is a deep, frightful Cha&s;m in the Mountain, in the hollow of which, the Road goes, by which they travel towards Bri&s;tol; and out of the &s;ame hollow, &s;prings a little River, which flolws with &s;uch a full Stream, that, it is &s;aid, it drives twelve Mills within a Quarter of a Mile of the Spring; but this is not to be un|der&s;tood, without &s;uppo&s;ing it to fetch &s;ome winding Reaches in the Way; there would not, otherwi&s;e, be room for twelve Mills to &s;tand, and have any Head of Wa|ter above the Mill, within &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace of Ground. The Water of this Spring, g$ows quickly into a River, and runs down into the Ma$&s;hes, and joins ano|ther little River called Axe, about Ax|bridge, and thence into the Bri&s;tol Chan|nel, or Severn Sea.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now turn Ea&s;t, and South-Ea&s;t, for I re&s;olved not to go up the $ills of Mendip at all, this Journey, leaving that Part to another Tour, when I &s;hall give an Account of the&s;e Mountains, as al&s;o of the Cities of Bath and Bri&s;tol, to which they are very near, all in one Letter.</P>
<P>I come now to that Part of the Coun|try, which joins it&s;elf to Wilt&s;hire, which I re&s;erved, in particular, to this Place, in order to give &s;ome Account of the Brood cloth Manufacture, which I &s;evera Times mentioned in my fir&s;t Journey and which is carried on here, and that to &s;uch a Degree, as de&s;erves a Places in all the De&s;criptions, or Hi&s;tories, which &s;hall be given of this Country.</P>
<P>As the Ea&s;t, and South Parts of Wilt|&s;hire are, as I have already ob&s;erved, all Hilly, &s;preading them&s;elves far and wide, in Plains, and Gra&s;&s;y Downs, for breed|ing, and feeding, va&s;t Flocks of $word$ and a prodigious Number of ther$: And as the We&s;t and North Parts of Somer$$t|&s;hire are, on the contrary. Low, and Mar&s;hy, or Moori&s;h, for feeding, and breeding, of black Cattle, and Hor$es, or for Lead-mines, &amp;c. So all the South-we&s;t Part of Wilt&s;hire, and the Ea&s;t Part of Somer&s;et&s;hire, are low and &s;lat, be|ing a rich, inclo&s;ed Country, full of Ri|vers and Towns, and infinitely populous, in&s;omuch, that &s;ome of the Market Towns are equal to Cities in Bigne&s;s, and &s;uperi|or to them in Numbers of People.</P>
<P>This low, flat Country, contains Part of the Three Counties of Somer&s;et, Wilts, and Glouce&s;ter, and that the Extent of it may be the ea&s;ier under&s;tood by tho&s;e who know any thing of the Situation of the Country, it reaches from Cire$c$&s;ter in the North, to Sherburn on the Edge of Dor&s;et&s;hire South, and from the De|vizes Ea&s;t, to Bri&s;tol We&s;t, which may take in about Fifty Miles in lenght where longe&s;t, and Twenty in breadth where narrowe&s;t.</P>
<P>In this Extent of Country, we have the following Market Towns, which are principally employ'd in the Clothing Trade, that is to &s;ay, in that Part of it, which I am now &s;peaking of; namely, Fine Medley, or mix'd Cloths, &s;uch as are u&s;ually worn in England by the bet|ler Sort of People; and, al&s;o, exported in great Quantities to Holland, Ham|burgh, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, &amp;c. The principal Clothing Towns in this Part of the Country, are the&s;e.</P>
<P>Somer&s;et&s;hire&punc; Frome, Pensford, Phi|lip's Norton, Bruton, Shepton Mallet, Ca&s;tle-carey, and Wincanton.</P>

<P>The&s;e Towns, as they &s;tand thin, and at con&s;iderable Di&s;tance from one ano|ther; for, except the two Towns of Bradford and Trabridge, the other &s;tand at an unu&s;ual Di&s;tance; I &s;ay the&s;e Towns are interlpers'd with a very great Number of Villages, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, innumera|ble Village, Hamblets, and &s;cattered Hou&s;es, in which, generally &s;peaking, the &s;pinning Work of all this Manufacture is performed by the poor People; the Ma|&s;ter Clothiers, who generally live in the greater Towns, &s;ending out the Wooll Weekly to their Hou&s;es, by their Ser|vants and Hor&s;es, and, at the &s;ame time, bringing back the Yarn that they have &s;pun and fini&s;hed, which then is fitted for the Loom.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ing and &s;louri&s;hing Circum|&s;tances of this Trade, are happily vi&s;ible by the great concour&s;e of People to, and increa&s;e of Buildings and Inhabitants in the&s;e principal clothing Towns where this Trade is carried on, and the Wealth of the Clothiers. The Town of Frome, or, as is it is written in our Maps, Frome Sellwood, is a Specimen of this which is &s;o prodgiou&s;ly increa&s;ed within the&s;e la&s;t twenty or thirty Years, that they have built a New Church, and &s;o many New Streets of Hou&s;es, and tho&s;e Hou&s;es are &s;o full of Inhabitants, that Frome is now reckoned to have more People in it, than the City of Bath, and &s;ome &s;ay, than even Salisbury it&s;elf, and if their Trade continues to increa&s;e for a few Years more, as it has done for tho&s;e pa&s;t, it is very likely to be one of the greate&s;t and wealthie&s;t Inland Towns in England.</P>
<P>I call it an Inland Town, becau&s;e it is particularly di&s;tingui&s;h'd as &s;uch, be|ing, not only no Sea Port, but not near any Sea Port, having no manner of Com|munication by Water, no Navigable Ri|ver at it, or near it. Its Trade is wholly Clothing, and the Cloths they make, are, generally &s;peaking, all conved to London: Black well Hall is their Market, and thi|ther they &s;end up the Gro&s;s of their Clothing Product; and, if we may be|lieve common Fame, there are above ten thou&s;and People in Frome now, more than live in it twenty Years ago, and yet it was a con&s;iderable Town then too.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o, &s;everal large Meeting-Hou&s;es, as well as Churches, as there are, generally in all the manufacturing Towns in England, e&s;pecially in the We&s;tern Counties.</P>
<P>The Devizes is, next to this, a large and important Town, and full of weal|thy Clothiers; but this Town has, late|ly, run pretty much into the Drugget|making Trade; a Bu&s;ine&s;s, which has made &s;ome Inva&s;ion upon the Broad-Cloth Trade, and great Quantities of Druggets are worn in England, as al&s;o, exported beyond the Seas, even in the Place of our Broad Cloths, and where they u&s;ually were worn and exported&punc; but this is much the &s;ame as to the Trade &s;till; for as it is all a Woollen Manufacture, and that the Druggets may properly be called Cloth, though narrow, and of a different make, &s;o the makers are all called Clothiers.</P>
<P>This River Avon, a noble and large fre&s;h River, branching it&s;elf into many Parts, and receiving almo&s;t all the Ri|vers on that Side the Hills, waters this whole fruitful Vale; and the Water of this River &s;eems particularly qualified for the U&s;e of the Clothiers; that is $o &s;ay, for dying the be&s;t Colours, and for full|ing and dre&s;&s;ing the Cloth, &s;o that the Clothiers generally plant them&s;elves up|on this River, but e&s;pecially the Dyers, as at Trubridge, and Bradford, which are the two mo&s;t eminent Cloathing
<PB REF="182">
Towns in that Part of the Vale for the marking fine Spani&s;h Cloths, and of the nice&s;t Mixtures.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Towns South, to War|min&s;ter, the &s;ame Trade continues, and the fine&s;t Medley Spani&s;h Cloths, not in England only, but in the whole World, are made in this Part. They told me at Bradford, That it was no extraordinary Thing to have Clothiers in that Country worth, from Ten Thou&s;and, to Forty Thou&s;and Pounds a Man, and many of the great Families who now pa&s;s for Gentry in tho&s;e Counties, have been Originally rai&s;ed from, and built up by this truly noble Manufacture.</P>
<P>If I may &s;peak here from the Au|thority of the ancient Inhabitants of the Place, and who have been curious Ob|&s;ervers upon this Subject, the Country which I have now de&s;cribed, as princi|pally imploy'd in, and maintained by this Prodigy of a Trade, contains Two Mil|lions, Three Hundred and Thirty Thou|&s;and Acres of Land, who has in it Seven hundred Eighty Eight Pari&s;hes, and Three Hundred and Seventy Four Thou&s;and People. It is true, that this is all gue&s;s|work; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s my&s;elf very willing to believe, that the Reckoning is far &s;hort of the Account; for the County is exceeding large and popu|lous.</P>
<P>It may be worth Enquiry, by the curious, how the Manufactures, in &s;o va&s;t a Con&s;umption of the Wool, as &s;uch a Trade mu&s;t take up, can be &s;up|plied with Wool for their Trade; and, indeed, it would be &s;omething &s;trange, if the An&s;wer were not at Hand.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may rea&s;onable conclude, that this Manufacture was at fir&s;t &s;eated in this County, or as we may &s;ay, planted it&s;elf here at fir&s;t, becau&s;e of the infinite Numbers of Sheep, which were &s;ed at that Time upon the Downs and Plains of Dor&s;et, Wilts, and Hamp&s;hire, all adjoining, as a $$ding Town, is &s;eated, or ri&s;es gradually&punc; upon &s;ome large River becau&s;e of the Benefit of the Navigation&punc; and as Gentlemen place the Man&s;$$&punc; Hou&s;es of their E&s;tates. and Seats $word$ their Families, as near the plea&s;ant Ri|vers, Woods, and &s;ine Pro&s;pects as po&s;|&s;ible, for the Delight of their Living&punc; &s;o the fir&s;t Planters of the Clothing Ma|nufacture, doubtle&s;s, cho&s;e this delight|ful Vale for its Seat, becau&s;e of the Neighbourhood of this Plains, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Fund of Wool for the carrying it on. Thus the Manu|facture of white Cloth was planted in Stround water in Glouce&s;ter, for the &s;ake of the excellent water there for the dy|ing Scarlets, and all Colours that are dyed in Grain, which are better dyed there, than in any other Place of Eng|land, &s;ome Towns near London excepted. Hence, therefore, we fir&s;t ob&s;erve, they are &s;upplied Yearly with the Fleeces of two or three Millions of Sheep.</P>
<P N="2">2. But as the Number of Sheep fed on there Downs is le&s;&s;ened, rather than $word$ becau&s;e of the many thou|&s;and Acres of the Carpet Ground being, of late Years, turned into Arable Land and &s;owed with Wheat; which, by the way, has made Warmin&s;ter a Market Town, on the Edge of Somer&s;et&s;hire, as it now is, without Exception&punc; the great|e&s;t Market for Wheat in England&punc; with this Exception only, viz. Where none of it is brought to &s;end to London.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, The Number of Sheep, and con&s;equently the Quantity of Wool, de|crea&s;ing, and at the &s;ame time the Ma|nufacture, as has been &s;aid, prodigiou&s;ly encrea&s;ing, the Manufactures applied them&s;elves to other Parts for a Supply, and hence began the Influx of North-Country Wool to come in from the Counties of Northampton, Leice&s;ter, and Lincoln, the center of which Trade, is about Tetbury and Cirence&s;ter, where are the Markets for the North-country Wool are &s;old every week, for the &s;up|ply of this prodigious con&s;umption.</P>

3 From London, they have great Quantities of Wooll, which is generally called Kenti&s;h Wooll, in the Fleece, which is brought up from thence by the Farmers, &s;ince the late &s;evere Acts again&s;t their &s;el|ling it within a certain Number of Miles of the Sea, al&s;o Fell Wooll for the Combers, bought of the Wooll-Staplers in Barnaby-&s;treet, and &s;ent back by the Carriers, which bring up the Cloths to Market.</P>
<P N="4">4 They have al&s;o, &s;ometimes, large Quantities of Iri&s;h Wooll, by the way of Bri&s;tol, or of Mynhead, in Somer&s;et&s;hire; but this is uncertain, and only on extra|ordinary Occa&s;ions. I omit the Spani&s;h Wooll, as being an Article by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus, in &s;hort, as tho&s;e that &s;ee the Numbers of Sheep fed on the Downs and Plains, as above, and that &s;ee the Quan|tity of Wooll brought to the Markets of Tetbury, and other Towns, and the Quantity &s;ent from London, all into this One Vale, would wonder how it was po&s;&s;ible to be con&s;umed, manufactured, and wrought up; &s;o on the other Hand, tho&s;e that &s;aw the Numbers of People $mploy'd, and the va&s;t Quantity of Goods made in this Part of England, would wonder where the whole Nation &s;hould be able to &s;upply them with Wooll.</P>
<P>And yet, notwith&s;tanding the whole Country is thus imploy'd in the Broad-Cloth Manufacture, as above, I mu&s;t not $word$ to mention, that here is a very great Application to another Trade or Two, which I am obliged, by my fir&s;t Scheme, not to forg t to mention, viz. The &s;up|plying the City of London with Provi|&s;ions; though it is true, that the general $mployment of the People in all this County, is in the Woollen Manufacture; yet, as the Spiuning is generally the Work of the Women and Children, and and that the Land is he exceeding rich and fertile, &s;o it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, but that here are Farmers in great Numbers, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to cultivate the Land, and &s;upply the re&s;t of the Inhabitants with Provi&s;ions; and this they do &s;o well, that notwith&s;tanding the County is &s;o exceed|ing populous, yet Provi&s;ions of all Sorts are very cheap, the Quantity very great, and a great Overplus &s;ent every Day to London for the Supply of their Demand, which, as I &s;aid before, is great enough to exhau&s;t a whole Nation.</P>
<P>All the lower Part of this County, and al&s;o of Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, adjoining, is full of large feeding Farms, which we call Dairies, and the Chee&s;e they make, as it is excellent good of its Kind, &s;o being a different Kind from the Che&s;hire, being &s;oft and thin, is eaten newer than that from Che&s;hire. Of this, a va&s;t Quantity is every Week &s;ent up to London, where, though it is called Glouce&s;ter&s;hire Chee&s;e, yet a great Part of it is made in Wilt|&s;hire, and the greate&s;t Part of that which comes to London, the Glouce&s;ter&s;hire Chee&s;e being more generally carried to Bri&s;tol, and Bath, where a very great Quantity is con&s;umed, as well by the In|habitants of Two populous Cities, as al&s;o for the Shipping off to our We&s;t India Colonies, and other Places.</P>
<P>This Wilt&s;hire Chee&s;e is carried to the River of Thames, which runs through Part of the County, by Land Carriage, and &s;o by Barges to London.</P>
<P>Again, in the Spring of the Year, they make a va&s;t Quantity of that we call Green Chee&s;e, which is a thin, and very &s;oft Chee&s;e, re&s;embling Cream Chee&s;es, only thicker, and very rich. The&s;e are brought to Market New and eaten &s;o, and the Quantity is &s;o great, and this Sort of Chee&s;e is &s;o univer&s;ally liked and ac|cepted in London, that all the low, rich Lands of this County, are little enough to &s;upply the Market; but then this holds only for the Two fir&s;t Summer Months of the Year, May and June, or little more.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the Farmers in Wil$&s;hire, and the Part of Glouce&s;ter&s;hire adjoining, &s;end a very great Quantity of Bacon up to London, which is e&s;teemed as the be&s;t Ba|con in England, Hamp&s;hire only excepted: This Bacon is rai&s;ed in &s;uch Quantities
<PB REF="184">
here, by rea&s;on of the great Dairies, as above; the Hogs being fed with the va&s;t Quantity of Whey, and skim'd Milk, which &s;o many Farmers have to &s;pare, and which mu&s;t, otherwi&s;e, be thrown away.</P>
<P>But this is not all, for as the North Part of Wil$&s;hire, as well the Downs, as the V$l$s, $word$ upon the River Thames and, in &s;ome $laces, comes up even to the Banks of it; &s;o mo&s;t of that Part of the County being Arable Land, th y low a very great Quantity of Barley, which is carried to the Markets at Ab$gdon, at Farrington, and &s;uch Places, where it is made into Malt, and carried to London. This imploys all the Hill Country from above Malmsbury to Marlbro', and on the Side of the Vale of White Hor&s;e, as 'tis called, which is in Bark&s;hire, and the Hills adjoyning&punc; a Tra$t of Ground, able to furni&s;h, con&s;idering its Fertility, a pro|digious Quantity of Barley, and does &s;o.</P>
<P>Thus Wil$&s;hire it&s;elf helps to &s;upply London with Chee&s;e, Bacon, and Malt, three very con&s;iderable Articles, be&s;ides that va&s;t Manufacture of $ine Spani&s;h Cloths, which I have &s;aid &s;o much of and I may, without being partial, &s;ay, that it is thereby rendered one of the mo&s;t im|portant Counties in England, that is to &s;ay, important to the Publick Wealth of the Kingdom. The bare Product is in it&s;elf prodigious great; the Downs are an $span$ of Wooll, and of $word$ and the Valley, or low Part of it, is $span$ and Bacon.</P>
<P>One Thing here is worth while to mention, for the Ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e Counties in England, where they are not yet arrived to that Perfection of Ilus|bandry, as in this County, and I have purpo&s;ely re&s;erved it to this $ace: The Cale is this&punc; The Downs or Plains, which are generally called Salisbury Plain; but, particularly, extend them&s;elves over the Counties of Southampton, Wilts, and Do$&s;et, were formerly all left open to be fed by the large Flocks of Sheep &s;o often mentioned; but now, &s;o much of the&s;e Downs are plowed up, as has in|crea&s;ed the Quantity of Corn $word$ in this County, in a prodigious $word$ and le&s;&s;ened their Quantity of $word$ above, all which his been done by $word$ their Sheep upon the plowed $span$ moving the Fold every $span$ Place, 'till the whole Piece $span$ has been folded on; this, and $span$ has made the&s;e Lands, which $span$ &s;elves are poor, and where, in $span$ the Earth is not above Six $span$ the &s;olid Chalk Rock, able $span$ good Wheat, as any of the $span$ in the Vales, $span$ I &s;ay this $span$ he &s;o remo$e $span$ and up $uch high Hills, for $word$ live always in the Valleys, $word$ Rivers, that it could not be $word$ while to carry $word$ from $word$ Hou&s;es, to tho&s;e remo$e Lands; $span$ the Draught up $span$ and the Ways &s;o $word$ that it $span$ all their $word$.</P>

<P>Having &s;poken of what is m$&s;t re|markable, or at lea&s;t, what mo&s;t occur|red to my Ob&s;ervation from the Land's End to Newbery in Bark&s;hire, I mu&s;t here take the Liberty to $$ok round upon &s;ome Pa&s;&s;$$&punc; $word$ in $word$ Times, which have made this Part of the Coun|try more famous than befo e. 1. On the Hills on this $word$ the Devi$es, is Roundway Down, where the Lord Wil|mot, and the King's Forces, beat, and intirely routed, the famous Sir William Waller, in the late Rebellion, or Civil War; from whence this Place $word$ called, by &s;ome, Runaway Down $word$ this Day. A little $earer towards Marlborough, is St. Ann's Hill, where, notwith&s;tanding &s;everal high Hills between and the Di|&s;tance of twenty two Miles, or more, is a fair View of Salisbury Steeple, or Spire, which i$, without all Di&s;pate, the h ghe&s;t in England. The Defe$t of S r W ll am Waller, take in the few words of one of the mo&s;t impartial Hi&s;torians of tho&s;e Times.&mdash;The Action was, in &s;hort, thus&punc;</P>
<P>Waller had always the Misfortune to $e beaten when he $word$ his Enemy to force a Fight. This was his Ca&s;e now: He heard that the Lord Wilmor, with a Body of the King's Forces, were marched into the We&s;t to join Colonel Greenville: Sir Arthur S$inning, and the Loyal Troops in $word$: Upon this he makes long matches to overtake, and intercept them, pretending to light them, join'd, or not join'd; but $ y $word$. Wilmot advancing with 150$ Hor&s;e of the King's be&s;t troops, join'd the We&s;|tern Forces at the Devizes, and facing about upon Waller, met him upon Round|way-Down,
<PB REF="186">
not far from St. Ann's Hill, mentioned above.</P>
<P>As I &s;aid, he who was &s;eeking out his enemy, mu&s;t him&s;elf be ea&s;y to be found, and therefore they &s;oon came together; for though Waller &s;eeing too late, that he was in an Error, would have been glad to have got off without fighting, yet &s;eeing the King's troops advance in full march to attack him, boldly drew up in Order of Battle, and marched forward to meet them: Upon which en&s;ued an ob&s;tinate, and very bloody Fight; for Waller was brave, and his Men had been enur'd to Victory, e&s;pecially his Infan|try, and though they were gallantly at|tack'd by Colonel Slanning, and Green|ville, the latter of whom was &s;lain, yet they &s;tood their ground, and could not be brokeu, but rather gain'd upon the Royali&s;ts: But the Lord Wilmot charg|ing with an irre&s;i&s;table Fury at the Head of the Cavalty, the Rebel Hor&s;e were broken, and put into confu&s;ion, a body of Wilmot's Hor&s;e pu&s;hing them quite out of the Field: Lord Wilmot then falling with rhe like Fury upon the Rear of the Foot, while the King's Foot lay hard upon them in the Front. They were, at la&s;t, broken al&s;o; and, in a word, quite overthrown: And there being no way to e&s;cape the Hor&s;e, upon an open wild Down, as that is, they were mo&s;t of them cut in Pieces, or taken Pri&s;on|ers. All their Cannon and Baggage were al&s;o taken, with their Ammunition; and Waller him&s;elf, with great Difficulty, e&s;caped. This was in the Month of Augu&s;t, 1643.</P>
<P>From this Action, as I &s;aid, this place was ever called Runaway-Down, in&s;tead of Rounway Down.</P>
<P>At Newbery there was another, or ra|ther a double Scene of Blood; for here were Two ob&s;tinate, and hard &s;ought, Battles, at two &s;everal Times, between the King's Army, and the Parliament's, the King being pre&s;ent at them both, and both fought almo&s;t upon the &s;ame Spot of Ground. In the&s;e Two Battles, &s;aid an Old experienced Soldier, that &s;erved in the King's Army, there was more Gene|ral&s;hip &s;hewn on both Sides, than in any other Battle through the whole Cour&s;e of the War; his meaning was, That the Generals, on both Sides, &s;hewed the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Skill in the managing, po&s;ting, bringing up, and drawing of their Troops; and as the Men fought with great Bravery on both Sides, &s;o the Generals, and their Officers, &s;hewed both their Bravery, and their Judgment. In the Fir&s;t of the&s;e Battles, the Succe&s;s was doubtful, and both Sides pretended to the Advantage: In the La&s;t, the King$ Army had apparently the work of it, and yet the King, in a very few Days, with a great Body of Hor&s;e, fetch'd off his Cannon, which he had, in the Clo&s;e of the Battle thru&s;t into Dunington Ca&s;tle, and carried them away to Oxford, the Head Quarter of his A my, or his Place of Arms, as it would be called now; and this he did in the Sight of the victo|rious Army, facing them at the &s;ame Time, with a Body of Six thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and they, on the other Hand, did not think fit to draw out to attack him. That Retreat, in point of Ho$our, was equal to a Victory, and gave new Cou|rage, as well as Reputation, to the King's Troops. Indeed the Parliament's nrmy was out-General d in that Part; for as they had beaten the King's Army out of the Field&punc; and obliged them to $word$ their Train of Artillery and Carriages in the Ca&s;tle, whioh was in it&s;elf a Place o$ no great Strength; they ought immedia|ly, even the &s;ame Night, to have inve&s;t|ed the Place, and po&s;ted their Army &s;o, as to cover the Siege; in which Ca&s;e, the Cannon, and all that was in the Ca&s;tle, had been their own; for though the King had indeed, a gallant Body of Hor&s;e, and &s;uperiot to the Parliament Cavalry by almo&s;t Three thou&s;and, yet hit be&s;t Regiments of Foot had been roughly handled in the Battle, and &s;ome of them quite cut in Pieces; &s;o that his Maje&s;ty would not have been in Conditi|on to have attacked them in their Po&s;ts, in order to have rai&s;ed the Siege.</P>
<P><PB REF="187">
But this is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s: This Town of Newbery is an antient cloath|ing Town, though, now, little of that $art remains to it; but it retains &s;till a manufacturing Genius, and the People are $enerally imployed in making Shalloons, $word$ kind of Stuff, which, though it be u&s;ed $nly for the Lineing and In&s;ides of Mens Cloaths, for Women u&s;e but little of it, $or the Men for any thing but as above, $et it becomes &s;o generally worn, both $t Home and Abroad, that it is increa&s;ed $o a Manufacture by it&s;elf, and is more $on&s;iderable, than any &s;ingle Manufacture $f Stuffs in the Nation. This imploys $he Town of Newbery, as al&s;o, Ando|ver, another Town on the &s;ide of Wilt|$ire, about Twelve Miles from it, and $bundance of other Towns, in other Counties of England, of which I &s;hall $peak in their Place.</P>
<P>And, having mentioned Andover, tho' $word$ of the Road that I was in, I mu&s;t di|$g$$s to tell you, that the Town of An|dover lies on the very Edge of the Downs $word$ I have to often mentioned, and is $word$ the Road from Newbery to Salisbury, $word$ it is from London to Taunton, and all $e manufacturing Part of Somer&s;et&s;hire$ $is a hand&s;om Town, well built, popu|lous, and much inriched by the Manu|facture, as above, and may be called a $riving Town: It &s;ends Two Members $word$ Parliament, and is an antient Corpora|tion.</P>
<P>But the chief Rea&s;on of my making his Digre&s;&s;ion, is to mention, that with|$ a Mile, or thereabouts, of this Town, $word$ the Place where the open Down Coun|try begins, is Wey hill, where the great|e&s;t Fair for Sheep is kept, that this Nati|on can &s;hew. I confe&s;s, though I once $w the Fair, yet I could make no E&s;ti|mate of the Number brought thither for $le; but asking the Opinion of a Gra&s;i|$ who had u&s;ed to buy Sheep there, he $ldly an&s;wered, There were many hun|dred thou&s;ands. This being too general, pre&s;s'd him farther; at length he &s;aid, e believed there were five hundred ou&s;and Sheep &s;old there in one Fair. Now, tho' this might, I believe, be too many, yet 'tis &s;ufficient to note, that there are a prodigious Quautity of Sheep &s;old here; nor can it be otherwi&s;e, if it be con&s;idered, that the Sheep &s;old here, are not for immediate killing, but are generally Ewes for &s;tore Sheep for the Farmers, and they &s;end for them from all the following Counties, Berks, Oxford, Bucks, Bedford, Hertford, Middle&s;ex, Kent, Surrey, and Su&s;&s;ex: The Cu&s;tom of the&s;e Farmers, is, to &s;e$d One Far|mer in behalf of (perhaps) Twenty, and &s;o the Sheep come up together, and they part them when they come home. The&s;e Ewes have al&s;o this Property, that they generally bring Two Lambs at a Time. What Weathers are bought here, are car|ried off by the Farmers who have feed|ing Grounds, in order to &s;$t them for kil|ling; but they are but few compared to the Ewes.</P>
<P>But to go back to Newbery: Not to in&s;i&s;t upon the famous Jack of Newbery, who was &s;o great a Clothier, tha$ when King James met his Waggons lo$de$ with Cloths going to London and inquiring who&s;e they were, was an&s;wered by them all&punc; They were Jack of Newbery's&punc; the King returned, if the Story be true, Th$$ this Jack of Newbery was $i$her then he But not to in&s;i&s;t upon this Man's St$$y which is almo&s;t grown fabulous, yet a|nother Story is Fact, and to be proved, viz. That this is one of the Two Legatee Towns (as they were called) in the Wall of the late famous Mr Kentick, who be|ing the Son of a Clothier of Newbery, and afterwards a Merchant in London, left Four thou&s;and Pounds to Newbery, and Seven thou&s;and Five hundred Pounds to Reading, to incourage the Cloathing Trade, and &s;et the Poor at Work, be&s;ides other Gifts of extraordinary Value to the Poor, as &s;uch. This Gentleman I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to mention again, and therefore I &s;ay no more now, only, that his E$$igie, or Picture, was to be &s;een, before the Fire in 1666, in S. Chri&s;topher's Church in Thread Needle-&s;treet, London, where he is buried, and where the Benefact on

he left for Prayers every Morning at &s;ix a Clock, Winter and Summer, in that Church, is &s;till injoyed, and the Prayers performed there accordingly: As likewi&s;e, it is at Reading, and at Newbery.</P>
<P>This extraordinary Will is to be &s;een at large in Stow's Survey of London, to which I refer, and which it is well worth the Reader's while to look over, the like not being heard of in England, before. It &s;eems he died a Batchelor, or, at lea&s;t, without Children, and his Legacies, all in ready Money, cannot amount to le&s;s, than forty thou&s;and or fifty thou&s;and Pounds, be&s;ides what might be included in the ge|neral Clau&s;e of leaving all the re&s;t of his E&s;tate to him who he made his univer&s;al Heir; which E&s;tate, as I have heard, amounted to a very great Value. That forty or fifty thou&s;and Pounds al&s;o, be|ing con&s;idered at the Time it was left, might well be rated at four times the Value, as the Rate of Things goes now, it being in the Year 1624 What Im|provement the Town of Newbery, or the Town of Reading, has made of the great Sums he left to their Management, that I did $ot inquire into.</P>
<P>Near this Town of Newbery, the late $arl of Craven built a very &s;tately Pile of Buildings for his own Dwelling, called Spine; but as it was never quite fini&s;hed, &s;o I do not under&s;tand, that his Lord&s;hip ever came to live in it, and, within the&s;e few Years, it was, by a &s;udden Fire, which no-body can, or no-body will, tell how it began, burnt down to the Ground. It was reported, the old Lord built this magnificent Palace, for &s;uch it was at a Time when he (&s;latter'd him&s;elf, at lea&s;t, with Expectation, and) had Hopes of marrying Madam Royal, as &s;he was then called, the Queen of Bohemia, Si&s;ter to King Charles I. who was then a Widow, and lived under the Shadow of the Eng|li&s;h Court; but being fru&s;trated afterwards in that View, his Lord&s;hip went no far|ther in his Building.</P>
<P>Here is was that the Vanguard, or fir&s;t Line of the Prince of Orange's Army, was po&s;ted, when the Iri&s;h Dragoons, who were po&s;ted in Reading, finding they &s;hould be attacked in a few Days, had pu the Town's People into &s;uch a Fright, by threatening to burn and plunder the Town and cut all the Peoples Throats, that they &s;ent expre&s;s Me&s;&s;engers to the Dutch Ge|neral Officer Grave Van Na&s;&s;au for Help who &s;ent them a Detachment of but Two hundred and Eighty Dragoons, though the Troops in the Town were near &s;even hundred Men.

<P>The next Town of Note, I &s;ay, i Reading,&punc; a very large and wealthy Town hand&s;omly built, the Inhabitants rich and driving a very great Trade. The Town lies on the River Kennet, but &s;$ near the Thames, that the large&s;t Barge$ which they u&s;e, may come up to th$ Town Bridge, and there they have Wharfs to load, and unload them. Thei$ chief Trade is by this Water-Navigati$$ to and from London, though they h$$ nece&s;&s;arily a great Trade into the Coun|try, for the Con&s;umption of the Go$ which they bring by their Barges fr$ London, and particularly $oa&s;s&punc;, Sa$$ Grocery Wares, Tobacco, Oyls, and all heavy Goods.</P>
<P>They &s;end form hence to London by the&s;e Barges, very great Quantities o$ Malt, and Meal, and the&s;e are the Two principal Articles of their Loadings, o$ which, &s;o large are tho&s;e Barges, that &s;ome of them, as I was told, bring a Thou|&s;and, or Twelve hundred Quarters o$ Malt at a Time, which, according to the ordinary Computation of Tonnage in the Freight of other Ve&s;&s;els, is from a hun|dred, to an hundred and twenty $word$ dead Weight.</P>

During the Civil Wars in England, this Town was &s;trongly For|ified, and the Remains of the Ba&s;tions, nd other works are &s;till to be &s;een; $ut the Royali&s;ts abandoning it after|wards, it was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Parliament, $on after the Battle at Newbery.</P>
<P>There are three Churches, and two $ge Meeting-hou&s;es in this Town, be|$es that of the Quakers; and the Town, ambden calls it a little City, is &s;aid to $ntain about Eight thou&s;and People, in|$uding a little Hamlet at the Bridge over $e Thames.</P>
<P>Here was once a mo&s;t famous Mo|&s;tery, founded by King Henry I. young Son of William the Conqueror, who s buried in it with his Queen, and his $ughter Maud; of whom it was &s;aid, e was a King's Daughter, but her&s;elf Queen; this is made out, in that $ was Daughter to Henry I. Wife to the Emperor of Germany, and Mo|ther to King Henry II. &s;o &s;he was an Empre&s;s, but not a Queen. This Ab|bey is now &s;o demoli&s;hed, that &s;carce any Remains of it are found, or the Place of it known.</P>
<P>As I have noted above, it was here that the Dutch with two hundred and eighty Hor&s;e and Dragoons, attacked the Forces of the late King James, in Aid of the di&s;tre&s;s'd Town's men, who they threatned to murder and plunder that very Day. It was on a Sunday morning, that the Iri&s;h Dragoons had re&s;olved on the de&s;ign'd Mi&s;chief, if they really in|tended it: In order to it, they po&s;ted a Guard at the principal Church in the Piazza there, and might, indeed, ea&s;ily have lock'd all the People in, and have cut their Throat$ $span$ they placed a Company of $span$ in the Church-yard of another Church, over again&s;t the $span$ that if they really did not in|tend to ma&s;&s;acre the People, as their Officers &s;aid they did not, yet that way of potting $span$ to the loud Oaths and Prote&s;tations, that they would do it, made it look as like &s;uch a $word$ as any thing unexecuted, or unattempted, could do.</P>
<P>In this Po&s;ture Things &s;tood when the Dutch entred the Town: The Iri&s;h had placed a Centinel on the Top of the Steeple of the great Church, with Orders, if he &s;aw any Troops advance, to fire his Peice, and ring the Bell; the Fellow, being &s;urprized with the Sight, for he di&s;cover'd the Dutch but a little before they reached the Town, fired his Mu&s;quet, but forgot to ring the Bell, and came down. However, his firing gave the Alarm &s;ufficiently, and the Troops in the Town, who were all under Arms before, whether for the de&s;ign'd Execution, or not, I will not determine; but, I &s;ay, being under Arms before, they had little more to do, but to po&s;t their Troops, which they did with Skill enough, being commanded by Sir John Lanier, an experienced Officer, and Co|lonel of a Regiment of Hor&s;e in King
<PB REF="190">
James's Army; and had the Men done their Duty, they might ea&s;ily have re|puls'd the few Troops that attack'd them; but the Dutch entering the Town in two Places, one by the ordinary Road from Newbery, and the other by the Broad Street near where the Hor&s;e-Fair is kept, forc'd both the Po&s;ts, and en|tered the Market Place, where the main Body of the Iri&s;h Troops were drawn up.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Party of the Dutch found a Company of Foot drawn up in the Church-yard over again&s;t the Bear-Inn, and a Troop of Dragoons in the Bear-Inn-Yard, the Dragoons hearing the Dutch were $word$ Hand, their Officer bravely drew them out $word$ the Inn Yard, and faced the Dutch in $word$ open Road, the Church-yard Wall being $word$ with Mu&s;quetiers to flank the Street&punc; the Dutch, who came on full Gallop fe$$ $word$ upon the Dragoons, Sword in Hand, a$$ $span$ &s;uch irre&s;i&s;table Fury, that the Iri&s;h were immediately put into Confu&s;ion, and af|ter three or four Minutes bearing the Charge, they were driven clear out of the Street. At the very &s;ame in&s;tant, another Party of the Dutch Dragoons, di&s;mounting, entered the Church yard, and the whole Body po&s;ted there, fled al&s;o, with little or no Re&s;i&s;tance, not &s;ufficient, indeed, to be called Re&s;i&s;tance. After this, the Dragoons, mounting again, forced their Squadrons, and entered the Market place.</P>
<P>Here, the Troops being numerous, made two or three regular Di&s;charges; but finding them&s;elves charged in the Rear by the other Dutchmen, who had by this time entered the &s;aid Broad Street, they not knowing the Strength, or Weakne&s;s of their Enemy, pre&s;ently broke, and fled by all the ways po&s;&s;ible, Sir John Lanier, having a Cala&s;h and Six Hor&s;es, got away with the fir&s;t, though he was twice headed by a Dutch Trooper, who endeavoured to &s;hoot one of the Hor&s;es, but mi&s;s'd his Shot, &s;o the Colonel got away.</P>
<P>The Dutch having cleared the Town&punc; pur&s;ued &s;ome of them as far as Twyford&punc; and &s;uch was the terror that they were in, that a Per&s;on, from whom I had this Part of the Relation, told me, he &s;aw one Dutch Trooper cha&s;e twelve of the Iri&s;h Dragoons to the River near Twy|ford, and ride into the Water a good way after them; nor dur&s;t Sir John Lanier's Regiment of Hor&s;e, and Sir John Fenwick's, and a third, who&s;e Colonel I do not remember, advanc$ to relieve their Friends, though they having had the Alarm, &s;tood drawn up upon the Hill on Twyford &s;ide of the River, where they might &s;ee by what a contemptible Number their numerou Party was pur&s;ued; for there were no$ above Five and Forty, or Fifty at mo&s;t of the Dutch, that pur&s;ued about thre$ hundred of the $ri&s;h Dragoons to Twyford</P>
<P>Thus the town of Reading was de|livered from the Danger they $word$ threatned with, and which they as reall $span$ the $word$ would ri&s;e. It is true, the $word$ $span$ denied afterwards, that there was any &s;uch De&s;ign, or that they intended to offer the People any Violence; but it is as true, that &s;everal of their Soldiers confe&s;s'd it, and gave private intimations of it, to the People in the Hou&s;es where they quartered, e&s;pecially &s;ome that had been kindly treated in their Quarters, and had a little Gratitude and Humanity than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I cannot omit to ob&s;erve one thing here, to which I was an Eye-Witne&s;s, and which will re&s;olve a Difficutly th t to this Day has puzzled the Under|&s;tandings of a great many People, if not of the whole Nation; namely, That here began the univer&s;al Alarm that &s;pread over the whole Kingdom (almo&s;t at the &s;ame Time) of the Iri&s;h being coming to cut every bodies Throats: The brief Account of which, becau&s;e it has &s;omething curious in it, I believe will be agreeable to you. The State of it is thus:</P>
<P><PB REF="191">
As the terror which the threatnings of the&s;e Iri&s;hmen had brought upon the whole town of Reading, obliged the Magi&s;trates, and chief of the inhabi|tants, to apply to the Prince of Orange's Army for immediate help, &s;o you can|not doubt, but that many of the inha|bitants fled for their Lives by all the ways that they could; and this was $word$ in the Night; for in the Day, the Soldiers, who had their Eyes every where, &s;topped them, and would not permit them to &s;tir, which &s;till increa&s;ed th$$$ terror.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that got away, you may be &s;ure, were in the utmo&s;t Fright and A|mazement, and they had nothing le&s;s in their Mouths, but that the Iri&s;h would (and by that time had) burnt the town, and cut the Throats of all the People, Men Women, and Children. I was then at Wind&s;or, and in the very interval of all this fright, King James being gone, and the Army retreated from Salisbury, the Lord Fever&s;ham calls the Troops to|gether, and cau&s;ing them to lay down their Arms, disbands them, and gives them leave, every Man, to go whither they would.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h Dragoons, which had &s;led from Reading, rallied at Twyford, and $aving not lo&s;t many of their Number (for there were not above twelve Men killed) they mar$hed on for Maiden $word$ &s;wearing and cur&s;ing, after $word$ mo&s;t $oldierly Manner, that they would burn $word$ the towns where ever they came, $word$ cut the Throats of all the People. $owever, whether it was, that they $hought them&s;elves too near the Dutch $word$ Maidenhead, or what el&s;e was the $atter, they did not offer to take Quar|$$rs at Maidenhead, the town al&s;o being $ll of King James's troops, &s;o they $arched on for Colebrook, blu&s;tering in $word$ &s;ame Manner, of what they would $word$ when they came there. The town $word$ Colebrook had Notice of their $word$ and how they had publickly threaten|$ to burn the town, and murder all $word$ People; but, happily for thom, they had quartered there a Regiment of Scots Foot, of tho&s;e Regiments which King James had cau&s;ed to march from Scot|land, to his Aid on this Occa&s;ion; and they had with them, as was the U&s;age of all the Foot in tho&s;e times, two Pieces of Cannon, that is to &s;ay, Field-Pieces, and they &s;tood ju&s;t in the Market-Place, pointing We&s;tward to the Street where the&s;e Gentlemen were to come.</P>
<P>The People of Colebrook applied im|mediately to the Scots Colonel, who&s;e Name I am very &s;orroy I cannot re|member, becau&s;e it is to his honour that I &s;hould mention i$, and begged his Protection. The Colonel calling a Council of his Officers, immediately re|&s;olved, they would make good their Quarters, unle&s;s they received Orders from their &s;uperior Officers to quit them, and that they would de&s;$nd the town from Plunder; and upon this, immediate|ly the Drums beat to Arms, and the Regiment came together in a few Mo|ments: It was in the Depth of Winter, and, by Con&s;equence, was Night, and being a wet day, the Evening was ex|ceeding dark, when &s;ome advanced Cen|tinels gave Notice, that they heard the Drums beat the Dragoons March, at &s;ome di&s;tance upon the Road.</P>
<P>Upon this the Colonel ordered a Lieutenant, with thirty Mu&s;queteers, to make an advanced Guard at the extreme Part of the town, and he was &s;upported by another Party of forty Men, mo&s;t Pikes, at a &s;mall Di&s;tance, who were to advance upon a Signal; and if the&s;e la&s;t &s;hould ingage, the Drums of the whole Regiment were to beat a March, and half the Battalion, to advance with the two Pieces of Cannon.</P>
<P>It was near ten a Clock at Night before the Dragoons reached the town, when the two advanced Dragoons, which, by the di&s;cipline at that time, always rode at a di&s;tance from the Regiment, were challenged by the Centinels placed by the Lieutenant, as above; upon which they gave Notice to the Regiment, who immediately halted, and an Officer, with
<PB REF="192">
&s;ome Dragoons (they could not tell how many, becau&s;e it was dark) came up, and demanded, Who they were that challenged) the Centinel called his Cor|poral, and he the Serjeant, with three Files of Mu&s;queteers, and they told the Officer what Regiment they belong'd to, and that they had Orders to &s;top any troops from entering the town, till their Colonel &s;hould be acquainted with it, and give farther Orders.</P>
<P>The Dragoons, as the Ground would admit drew up in Front, and their Of|ficers began to huff and threaten, that they were the King's troops, and within the Line of the army; that they mu&s;t have quarters in the town, and ought not to be refu&s;ed by their own &s;ide.</P>
<P>By this time the Lieutenant came up al&s;o: He gave the Officer of Dragoons very good Words, and told him, He know too well what belonged to the Duty of a &s;ubaltern Officer, to blame him for doing his Duty; but that the Regiment was under Arms, and the Co|lonel at the Head of them in the Mar|ket-Hou&s;e, and he would immedi$$$ly &s;end to him for Orders, and doubted no$, but that the Colonel would give them Quarters in the town. The Dra|goons not &s;atisfied with this civil U&s;age, threatened, &s;wore, rag'd, and damning the Colonel, and the Regiment, though not pre&s;ent, &s;aid they would have Quar|ters without asking Leave of any Man, and the Officer turning about to a Ser|geant, bid him go back, and cau&s;e the Regiment to advance.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant told him calmly, He was &s;orry to &s;ee him act $o; but if that was his Re&s;olution, he was ready for him, and immediately called out to his Ser|geant to give the Signal to the next Party to advance, and told the Officer of Dra|goons, that if he &s;tirred one Foot forward, or any of his Men, he would fire upon them immediately. The Forty Men ad|vanced, and in two Minutes after, they heard the Drums of the Regiment beat the Scots March.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Dragoons halted again, and the Major of the Dragoons advanc|ing to the Parlee, the Lieutenant-Colonel of the Foot, was al&s;o come up to the Lieutenant's Party, with the forty Men, and with the Colonel's An&s;wer to the De|mand of Quarters; namely, That if the Dragoons had any Orders in Writing from the General for quartering in the Town, or for marching that Way, he was very ready to give them $word$ but if not, they were his Quarters, and he would defend them to the le&s;t Man&punc; and No body &s;hould come in there, e&s;peci|ally at that Time of Night.</P>
<P>The Dragoons, however, in&s;ulted and menac'd the Major al&s;o, and that at &s;uch a Rate, that he gave Orders immediately to acquaint the Colonel with it, who in|&s;tantly advanced, in full March, with the whole Regiment, having about two hundred Links lighted to let them &s;ee the Way, the Night being exceeding dark</P>
<P>When the Dragoons &s;aw this, and having no Stomach to engage&punc; they de|&s;i&s;ted; but raged and &s;tormed at &s;uch a Rate, as I cannot expre&s;s, and taking the Road to Stanes, &s;wore, they &s;hould go thither, aud burn the Town, and kill Man, Wo|man and Child.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Blu&s;ters were &s;o loud, and the Fellows, by Nation, &s;uch as from whom it might be expected, as put the People of C$lebrook, the Fright they had been in for them&s;elves being a little over, into a &s;econd Concern for their Neighbour|hood at Stanes, and &s;ome of them &s;hewed the Concern to be &s;o real, that they &s;ent Expre&s;s upon Expre&s;s to Stanes, to ac|quaint the People there of their Danger, knowing there was, at that Time, only Two Companies of Foot, of Colonel Regiment, in the Town. When the&s;e Me&s;&s;engers came there, they found the Poople already alarmed by others, who had come from the &s;ame Town of Colebrook, in the fir&s;t Fright, with the News, that the Iri&s;h were co|ming to burn the &s;aid Town of Colebrook, and that, by that Time, they did not que&s;tion but that they had done it, and they were &s;urprized to hear now, that it
<PB REF="193">
was not done; but upon the arriving of the&s;e Me&s;&s;engers, bringing Word, that they had burnt Colebrook, but for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Scots Regiment; and that they were coming to Stanes, and $wore, they would kill Man, Woman and Child; it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Con|$ternation of the People: Away they run $ut o$ the Town, Dark and Rainy, and M$d$ight as it was, &s;ome to King&s;ton, $me over the Heath to Hownflow, and $word$ a$ford, &s;ome to Egham, and &s;ome to $word$ with the dreadful News; and $y that time they reached tho&s;e Places. $eir Fears had turned their Story from $ying, they would burn and kill, to they $word$ burned and killed, and were coming $ter you to do the like,</P>
<P>The &s;ame Alarm was carried by others $word$ Colebrook to Uxbridge; for thither $word$ Dragoons were for marching at fir&s;t; $word$ thus, &s;ome one Way, and &s;ome ano|ther, it &s;pread like the Undulations of e Water in a Pond, when a flat Stone $word$ upon the Surface: From Brentford $ King&s;ton, and from Uxbridge, it came erally, and by different Roads, to Lon|n, and &s;o, as I may &s;ay, all over Eng|$d; nor is it wonderful, that it &s;eemed be all over the Nation in one Day, ich was the next after this Beginning; $t gave Wings to the News, no Po&s;t $id carry it as it fl$w from Town to wn, and &s;till every Me&s;&s;enger had two $cles with him. 1. Not that &s;uch and $ Towns were to be burnt and plun|$d by them; but that they were alrea|$burnt; and 2. That the Iri&s;h were at $t Heels to do the like.</P>
<P>This, I think, is a clear Account of Alarm, and what can be more $word$ Colebrook was not the Ca&s;e, for $re ever the Colebrook Men came, $word$ were asked, If their Town was $word$ I rode the next Morning to $word$ At Slough they told me, $word$ was burnt, and U$bridge, and $word$ and I know not how many more, de&s;troy'd; and when I came to $word$ they told me, Maidenhead and Ok|$n were burnt, and the like. From thence I went to Henley, where the Prince of Orange, with the &s;econd Line of his Army, entered that very After|noon, and there they had had the &s;ame Account, with the News of King James's Flight; and thus it &s;pread every Way in|&s;en&s;ibly. The Manner is too recent in Memory, to need my giving any De&s;crip|tion of it.</P>
<P>My next Stage from Reading, was to Great Marlow in Buckingham&s;hire, which, though not in the direct Road, yet lying on the Banks of the River of Thames&punc; is, in my Cour&s;e, proper enough to be &s;pok|en of and is particularly worth Notice for &s;everal Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a Town of very great Embarka|tion on the Thames, not &s;o much for Goods wrought here, (for the Trade of the Town is chiefly in Bone Lace) but for Goods from the neighbouring Towns, and particularly, a very great Quantity of Malt, and Meal, is brought hither from High-Wickham, a large Market Town, about Miles off, which is one of the greate&s;t Corn Markets on this &s;ide of England, and lies on the Road from London to Oxford.</P>
<P N="2">2. Between High-Wickham and Mar|low, is a little River called the Loddon, on which are a great many Mills, and particularly Corn Mills, and Paper Mills; the fir&s;t of the&s;e, grand and dre&s;s the Wheat, and then the Meal is $$nt to Mar|low, and loaded on Board the Barges for London: And the &s;econd makes great Quantities of Printing Paper, and than&punc; very good of its Kind, and cheap, &s;uch as generally is made U&s;e of in printing o$r News Papers, Journals, &amp;c and &s;mal|ler Pamphlets; but not much &s;i$$, or large, for bound Books, or Writing.</P>
<P N="3">3 On the River of Thames, ju&s;t by the Side of this Town, though on the other Bank, are three very remarkable Mills, which are called the Temple&punc;mills, which are called al&s;o, the Bra&s;s-mills, and are for making Bi&s;ham Abbey Battery Work, as they call it, viz. Bra&s;s Kettles, and Pans, &amp;c. of all Sorts. They have fir&s;t a Foundary, where, by the Help of
<PB REF="194">
Lapis Caliminaris, they convert Copper into Bra&s;s, and then, having ca&s;t the Bra&s;s in large broad Plates, they beat them out by the Force of great Hammers, wrought by the Water mills, into what Shape they think fit for Sale. Tho&s;e Mills went on by the &s;trength of a good Stock of Money in a Company or Partner &s;hip, and with very good Succe&s;s, 'till at la&s;t, they turn|ed it into what they call a Bubble, brought it to Exchange Alley, &s;et it a Stock-jobbing in the Days of our South-Sea Madne&s;s, and brought it up to be &s;old at one hundred Pounds per Share, who&s;e intrin&s;ick Worth was perhaps ten Pounds, 'till, with the Fall of tho&s;e Things toge|ther, it fell to nothing again. Their Trea|&s;urer, a Trade&s;man in London, failed, ha|ving mi&s;apply'd about thirty thou&s;and Pounds of their Money, and then, as it is u&s;ual where want of Succe&s;s goes be|fore, quarelling among them&s;elves fol|lowed after, and &s;o the whole Affair &s;unk into a Piece of mere Confu&s;ion and Lo&s;s, which otherwi&s;e was certainly a very be|neficial Undertaking.</P>
<P N="4">4. Next to the&s;e are Two Mills, both extraordinary in them&s;elves, one for mak|ing of Thimbles, a Work excellently well fini&s;hed, and which performs to Admirati|on, and another for pre&s;&s;ing of Oyl from Rape &s;eed, and Flax-&s;eed, both which, as I was told, turn to very good Account to the Proprietors.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o brought down a va&s;t Quan|tity of Beech Wood, which grows in the Woods of Buckingham&s;hire more plenti|fully than in any other Part of England. This is the mo&s;t u&s;eful Wood, for &s;ome U&s;es, that grows, and without which, the City of London would be put to more Difficulty, than for any thing of its Kind in the Nation.</P>
<P N="1">1. For Fellies for the great Carrs, as they are called, which ply in London Streets for carrying of Merchandizes, and for Cole&punc;Carts, Du&s;t&punc;Carts, and &s;uch like Sorts of Voiture, which are not, by the City Laws, allowed to draw with &s;hod Wheels, or Wheels tyr'd with Iron.</P>
<P N="2">2. For Billet Wood for the King's Pa|laces, and for the Plate and Flint Gla&s;s Hou&s;es, and other &s;uch nice Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3. Beech Quarters for divers U&s;es, particularly Chair-makers, and Turnery Wares. The Quantity of this, brought from hence, is almo&s;t incredible, and yet &s;o is the Country overgrown with Beech in tho&s;e Parts, that it is bought very rea|&s;onable, nor is there like to be any Scar|city of it for Time to come.</P>
<P>At Bi&s;ham, overagain&s;t this Town, was formerly an Abbey, and the Remains of it are &s;till to be &s;een there: The E&s;tate belongs to the Antient Family of the Name of Hobby. Some of the Heads of this Family, were very eminent in for|mer Days, particularly Sir William Hob|by, and Sir Edward Hobby, the latter having been imployed by Queen Eliza|beth in the mo&s;t important Foreign Ne|gotiations. Their Monuments, with tho&s;e of their Ladies, and Sons, are now to be &s;een, and well worth &s;eeing they are, in the little Church of Bi&s;ham. The S$at of the Family, is now in Dor$et&s;hire, where Sir Thomas Hobby is &s;t ll living; but they are generally all brought hither, when they die, to be buried with their Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>A little higher, on the &s;ame Side of the River, is Hurley, an antient Seat of the Lord Lovelace, and that Family being ex|tinct, it came, by the Daughter and Heire&s;s, to Sir Henry John&s;on of Black|wall, near Ratcliff, who originally was only a Shipwright, or Ma&s;ter builder, at the great Yard and Dock there, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in their Place. This Lady left only one Daughter, married to the Earl of Strafford, and who now enjoys the Hurly E&s;tate, in the Right of the ab ove marriagesof the Daughters.</P>
<P>There are two other Towns on the Thames, which I have already mentioned, viz. Henly and Maidenhead, which have little or nothing remarkable in them; but that they have great Bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o, by the Trade for Malt and Meal and $$m|ber for London, which they &s;hip, or
<PB REF="195">
load, on their great Barges for London, as the other Towns do.</P>
<P>And now I am, by ju&s;t Degrees, come to Wind&s;or, where I mu&s;t leave talking of Trade, River, Navigation, Meal, and Malt, and de&s;cribe the mo&s;t beautiful, and mo&s;t plea&s;antly &s;ituated Ca&s;tle, and Royal Palace, in the whole I&s;le of Britain.</P>
<P>Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle, founded, as &s;ome &s;ay, by William the Conqueror, if there was $ay thing in that Part, was at lea&s;t re|built, by Edward III. But the Truth of the Story is this, William the Conqueror did pitch upon it as a plea&s;ant Situation, $n a delightful &s;porting Country, and agree|$ble to him, who delighted much in Hunting; and, as he &s;ays of it, a Place $tted for the Entertainment of Kings, and therefore treated with the Abbot of We&s;tmin&s;ter for an Exchange, and &s;o $ook Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. He al&s;o had &s;eve|$al little Lodges, or Hunting Hou&s;es, in $e Fore&s;t adjoyning, and frequently lodg'd, $r the Conveniency of his Game, in a $ou&s;e which the Monks before injoy'd, $ear, or in the Town of Wind&s;or, for $e Town is much more antient than the $a&s;tle, and was an eminent Pa&s;s upon the $hames in the Reign of the Saxon Kings: $t to pa&s;s over the Antiquity or Hi&s;tory $ the Town, this is certain, That King $dward III took an extreme Liking to $e Place, becau&s;e of its beautiful Situa|$on, and plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect, which, in|&s;ed, is not to be out-done, in any Part $ the Kingdom: Here, at length, the $ng re&s;olved to fix his Summer Re&s;idence $d him&s;elf laid out the Plan of a mo&s;t $gnificent Palace, the &s;ame, as to the $tward Form and Building, as we now $ it; for what&s;oever has been done for $utifying, altering, or amending the In|$e and Apartments, there has nothing $n added to the Building it&s;elf, except $t noble Terras, which runs under the $rth Front, and leads to the Green on $ Park, at the Ea&s;t Side, or End of it, $ng which Ea&s;t End, the fine Lodgings, $ Royal Apartments, were at fir&s;t built, the North-part being then taken up in Rooms of State, and Halls for publick Balls, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e it&s;elf was, indeed, a Palace; and without any Appearance of a Forti|fication; but when the Building was brought on to the Slope of the Hill on the Town Side, the King added Ditches, Ramparts, the round Tower, and &s;everal Addenda of Strength; and &s;o it was im|mediately called a Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The Pretence which &s;ome made to an old Story, that William of Wickham built this Ca&s;tle, is a Story &s;o evidently fabul|ous, and &s;o plainly detected, that the ve|ry Relations which pretend to it, di&s;cover the contrary; owning, that the King was &s;o incenied again&s;t him, but for a Sugge&s;ti|on, that he had a Project of a&s;&s;uming the Honour of being the Founder, that it had like to have co&s;t William all his Intere&s;t in the King's Favour, which, at that Time, was very great; and the Duke of Lan|ca&s;ter, who was his irreconcilable Enemy, took the Advantage of prompting the King to make that Sugge&s;tion; but he cleared him&s;elf by denying, that he ever made any Pretence to being the Founder, only put this Con&s;truction upon the Words, That the Money, and the Reputation he had gained by building the Ca&s;tle tor the King, had been the making of him. The Words were the&s;e,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>THIS MADE WICKHAM.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e Words, they &s;ay, he had cau&s;ed to be cut on a Stone in the inner Wall of the little Tower, which from him, is to this Day called Winche&s;ter Tower.</P>
<P>But to pa&s;s over this Fiction, this is certain, King Edward was the Founder of the whole Work, and the Plan of it was much of his own Contrivance; but he committed the Over&s;eeing, and Direction of the Works, to William of Wickham, or, if you plea&s;e, William of Wickham was the Sir Chri&s;topher Wren of that Court; for William was then a Layman, not having had a liberal Education, but had a good Genius, a mighty Lover of
<PB REF="196">
Building, and had applied his Head much that Way; nor, indeed, does the Build|ing it&s;elf fail to the Head, or Ma&s;ter-Builder, a great deal of Honour; for in all the Decorations and Ornaments, which have been made &s;ince by the Princes who have liked Wind&s;or be&s;t, they have found no Occa&s;ion to alter any of the Front, or to pull down, or build up, add, or di|mini&s;h, except it be &s;ome &s;mall Matter at the Entrance to the great Stair-Ca&s;e, the Kitchen, and Offices below Stairs, and the like; but the great North, and Ea&s;t Fronts, the Square of the inner Court, the great Gates at the entering from the Town, with the Round Tower, and the Walls annexed, are all &s;tanding in the ve|ry Form in which King Edwad III. left them.</P>
<P>The only Addition in the In&s;ide, is a fine Eque&s;trian Statue of King Charles II. which &s;tands over the great Well, &s;unk, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, in the fir&s;t Building, for the Supply of the Ca&s;tle with Water, and in which was an Engine for rai&s;ing the Water, not with&s;tanding the great Depth, by very little Labour; the Contrivance and Performance done by the great Sir Samuel Morland, one of the be&s;t-natur'd Mechanicks of Time, and as good a Ma|thematician.</P>
<P>On the Out&s;ide was added, the Terrace Walk, built by Queen Elizabeth, and where &s;he u&s;ually walked for an Hour every Day before her Dinner, if not hin|dered by windy Weather, which &s;he had a peculiar Aver&s;ion to; for as to rainy Weather, it would not always hinder her, but &s;he rather loved to walk in a mild, calm Rain, with an Umbrella over her Head.</P>
<P>This Walk was really a magnificent Work; for as it is rai&s;ed on the Side of a Precipice, or &s;teep Declivity of the Hill, &s;o that Hill was nece&s;&s;arily cut down a very great Depth to bring the Foundati|on to a Flat equal to the Breadth, which was to be formed above. From the Foun|dation it was rai&s;ed by &s;olid Stone Work, of a va&s;t Thickne&s;s, with cro&s;s Walls of Stone, for banding the Front, and pre|venting any Thru&s;t from the weight of Earth within. Then this Work was all to be filled up again within, after all that was fir&s;t taken out, was thrown down the Front of the Hill, to pu&s;h out the Precipices &s;till farther, that it might be the &s;ame Slope from the Terrace, as it was before from the Foot of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This noble Walk is covered with fine Gravel, and has Cavities, with Dreins, to carry off all the Water; &s;o that let it rain as it will, not a Drop of it is &s;een to re&s;t on the Walk, but it is day, hard, and fit to walk on immediately. The bread$$ of this Walk is very &s;pacious on the North Side, on the Ea&s;t-Side it is narrower; but neither at Ver&s;ailles, or at any of the Royal Palaces in France, or at Rome, or Naples, have I ever &s;een any thing like it. The Gaand Seignior's Terrace in the outer Court of the Seraglio, next the Sea, is the neare&s;t to it, that I have read of, and yet not equal to it, if I may be|lieve the Account of tho&s;e who have &s;een it; for that, I acknowledge, I have not &s;een. At the North-ca&s;t Corner of this Terrace, where it turns South, to $word$ on by the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Ca&s;tle, there are Steps, by which you go off upon the Plain of the Park, which is kept &s;mooth as a Carpet, and on the Edge of which, the Pro&s;pect of the Terrace is doubled by a Vi&s;ta, South over the Park, and quite up to the great Park, and towards the Fore&s;t. Here al&s;o is a &s;mall Seat, fit for One, or but Two at the mo&s;t, with a high Back, and Cover for the Head, which turns &s;o ea&s;ily, the whole being fixed on a Pin of Iron, or Bra&s;s, of Strength &s;uf|ficient, that the Per&s;ons who &s;it in $word$ may turn it from the Wind, and which Way &s;oever the Wind blows, or how hard &s;oever, yet they may &s;it in a per|fect Tranquility, and enjoy a compleat Calm. This is &s;aid al&s;o, to be Queen Elizabeth's own Invention, who, though &s;he delighted in being abroad in the Air, yet hated to be ruffled with the Wind. It is al&s;o an admirable Contrivance for the Per&s;on &s;itting in it, to &s;helter him&s;elf from the Sun.</P>
<P><PB REF="197">
This lofty Terrace makes the Ca&s;tle quite another Thing, and gives an Egre&s;s to the People within to the Park, and to a mo&s;t beautiful Walk, which King Edward III. nor his Succe&s;&s;ors for &s;ome Hundreds of Years, knew nothing of, all their Pro&s;pect being from the Win|dows of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>On that Side of the Building whi&s;h looks out upon the Terrace, are all the Royal Apartments, King Edward I$I's were on the Ea&s;t Side. The Ea&s;t Side is now allotted to great Officers of State, who are obliged to attend when the Court removes to Wind&s;or such as the Lord Trea&s;urers, Secretaries of State, Lo d High Chancellor, Lord Archbi&s;hop of Can$$$bury, and the like; and below they have proper Offices for Bu&s;ine&s;s, if they plea&s;e to order any to be done there.</P>
<P>You mount into the Royal Apartments, by &s;everal back S airs; but the publick Way is up a &s;mall A&s;cent to a Flat, or ha f Pace (for$ love to make my Account &s;peak Engli&s;h) where there are Two Entries of State, by too large Stair&punc;Ca&s;es, one on the left Hand to the Royal Apart|ments, and the other, on the Right, to St. George's-Hall, and the Royal Cha|pel.</P>
<P>Before the Entrance to the&s;e, on ei|ther &s;ide, you pa&s;s throughout the Guard Chambers, where you lee the Walls fur|ni&s;hed with Arms, and the King's Beef-Eaters, as they call the Yeomen of the Guard, keep their Station, or as it may be called, their main Guard. The&s;e Rooms lead e ther way, towards the fine Lodgings, or towards St. George's Hall, which you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Royal Lodgings, there have $een &s;o many Alterations of Furniture, $at there can be no entering upon the $articular De&s;cription. In one of tho&s;e Lodgings, the late Queen Mary &s;et up rich Atlas, and Chints Bed, which, $ tho&s;e Times, was invaluable, the Chints eing of Ma&s;slapatan, on the Coa&s;t of $oromandel, the fine&s;t that was ever &s;een before that time in England; but the Rate of tho&s;e Things have &s;uffered much Alteration fince that time. Al&s;o here was, &s;ome time before that, the Picture of the late Dutche&s;s of Port&s;|mouth at full Length, a noble Piece, and of which 'twas &s;aid, King Charles II. &s;hould &s;ay, 'twas the fine&s;t Painting, of the fine&s;t Woman in Chri&s;tendom; but our Engli&s;h Ladies of Queen Mary's Court, were of another Opinion, and the Gallery of Beauties, as it was called, which her Maje&s;ty placed in the Water Gallery at Hampton-Court, &s;hews &s;eve|ral as good Faces, and as good Paint|ing.</P>
<P>In the Chimney-Piece of one of the&s;e Apartments, is a Piece of Needle-work exqui&s;itely fine, performed, as they &s;ay&punc; by the Queen of Scots, during the time of her confinement in Fotheringay-Ca&s;tle. There are &s;everal Family Pieces in the Chimney-Pieces, and other Parts of tho&s;e Lodgings, that are valuable, becau&s;e of the Per&s;ons they repre&s;ent: But the fine|ry of Painting is to come.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rooms look all out North to|wards the Terrace, and over Part of the fine&s;t, and riche&s;t, Vale in the World; for the &s;ame Vale attending the cour&s;e of the River Thames, with very little interruption, reaches to, and includes the City of London Ea&s;t, and the City of Oxford We&s;t: The River, with a wind|ing, and beautiful Stream, gliding gently through the middle of it, and enriching by its Navigation, both the Land and the People on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that, as William the Conqueror expre&s;&s;es it in his Letter to the Monks at Wind&s;or, it was a Place fit for the Entertainment of Kings, &s;o it is; for it &s;eems, by Nature, to be formed for a Palace; and for Delight, all Kinds of Plea&s;ure and Convenience, that any Country, at lea&s;t in England, can afford, are to be found here.</P>
<P>It may be proper here to &s;ay &s;ome|thing to the Beauties and Ornaments of St. George's Hall, though nothing can
<PB REF="198">
be &s;aid equal to what the Eye would be Witne&s;s to; 'tis &s;urprizing, at the fir&s;t Entrance, to &s;ee at the upper End, the Picture of King William on Hor&s;eback, under him, an A&s;cent with Marble &s;teps, a Balu&s;trade, and a half Pace, which, formerly, was actually there, with Room for a Throne, or Chair of State, for the Sovereign to &s;it on, when on pub|lick Days he thought fit to appear in Ceremony.</P>
<P>No Man that had &s;een the former &s;teps, or A&s;cent, and had gone up to the Balu&s;trade and Throne, as I had done, could avoid &s;uppo&s;ing, they were there &s;till; and as on a ca&s;ual View, having been ab&s;ent &s;ome Years out of the Na|tion, I was going forward towards the End of the Hall intending to go up the Steps, as I had done formerly, I was confounded, when I came nearer, to &s;ee that the A&s;cent was taken down, the Marble Steps gone, the Chair of State, or Throne, quite away, and that all I &s;aw, was only painted upon the Wall below the King and his Hor&s;e; indeed it was &s;o lively, &s;o bright, &s;o exqui&s;itely performed, that I was perfectly deceived, though I had &s;ome Preten&s;ions to Judg+ment in Pictures too; nor was my Eye alone undeceived, others were under the &s;ame Deception, who were then with me.</P>
<P>When I came to the farther End, and look&punc;d from the Throne, as I called it, down the Hall, I was again &s;urprized, though mo&s;t agreeably, I confe&s;s, viz The Painting on the Side of the Hall, which was the Repre&s;entation of Prince Edward's Triumph, in Imitation of Cae|&s;ar's glorious Entry into Room, and which was drawn marching from the lowet End of the Room, to the upper, that is to &s;ay, from the Door, which is in the Corner on the North Side of the Hall, was now wholly inverted, and the &s;ame Triumph was performed again; but the March turned ju&s;t the other Way.</P>
<P>That this could be done no other Way, but by widing the whole Work out, and painting it all over again, was ea&s;y to conclude, &s;eeing it was not done upon Cloth, but upon the mere Plai&s;ter of the Wall, as appeared by the Salts of the Lime in the Wall, having work'd out, and &s;poil'd a great Piece of the Paint; be&s;ides, the Nature of the Thing for|bids, for if it had been a Canvas, turn|ing it would have been impracticable, for then all the Imagery would have &s;tood Heels up&punc; unle&s;s it had been carried on to the directly oppo&s;ite Part of the Hall, and that could not be, becau&s;e there were the Windows, looking all into the Inner Court of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Panting was done by Mr. Vartio, who, after fini&s;hing this Work, was entertained for 12 Years at Bur|ley Hou&s;e, near Stamford, by that great Lover of Art, and particularly of fine Painting, the Earl of Exce&s;ter: After which King William entertained him and, as they told me, he performed this &s;e|cond painting of the Hall, with greater Ma&s;ter&s;hip of Hand than he had done the Fir&s;t: The Painting of the Cedings generally remain, being fini&s;hed by the &s;ame Hand is a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite manner at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t End of the Hall is the Chappel-Royal, the neare&s;t and fine&s;t of the Kind in England; the carv'd work is beyond any that can be &s;een in Eng|land, the Altar-Piece is that of the in|&s;titution, or, as we may call it, our Lord's fir&s;t Supper. I remember, that going with &s;ome Friends to &s;hew them this magnificent Palace, it chanced to be at the Time when the Di&s;&s;enters were a little unea&s;y at being obliged to kneel at the Sacrament; one of my Friends who, as I &s;aid, I carried to &s;ee Wind&s;or&punc;Ca&s;tle, was a Di&s;&s;enter, and when he came into the Chapel, he fix'd his Eyes upon the Altar-Piece with &s;uch a fix'd, &s;teady Po&s;ture, and held it &s;o long, that I could not but take Notice of it, and a&s;ked him, Whether it was not a $word$
<PB REF="199">
Piece? Yes, &s;ays he, it is; but, whi&s;per|ing to me, he added, How can your Peo|ple pro&s;ecute us for refu&s;ing to kneel at the Sacrament? Don't you &s;ee there, that though our Saviour him&s;elf officiates, they are all &s;itting about the Table?</P>
<P>I confe&s;s it &s;urprized me, and, at fir&s;t, I knew not what An&s;wer to make him; but I told him, That was not a Place for him and I to di&s;pute it, we would talk of it afterwards, and &s;o we did, but brought it to no Conclu&s;ion, &s;o 'tis needle&s;s to mention it any more here.</P>
<P>After we had &s;pent &s;ome Hours in view|ng all that was curious on this Side, we came down to the Dungeon, or Round Tower, which goes up a long, but ea&s;y, A&s;cent of Steps, and is very high. Here $e were ob&s;iged to deliver up our Swords, $u$ no where el&s;e.</P>
<P>There is nothing curious here: The $overnor or Con&s;table's Lodgings, are ery well, and neatly furni&s;hed, but no|$ing extraordinary, e&s;pecially they will o$ look &s;o, after &s;eeing the fine Lodgings, $ above. From this Tower, you &s;ee St. aul's Cathedral at London, very plainly: $oming down from hence, we came into $e other Court, where is the great Chapel $ the Garter, and the Hou&s;e or College $r the poor Knights, as they are called.</P>
<P>The late Duke of Northumberland, who as Con&s;table of this Ca&s;tle, met with a $ry &s;trange, and uncommon Accident in $ming hither from Stanes in his Coach; $ being be$igh$ed, as we call it in Eng|$$d, the Night al&s;o very dark, and pa&s;|$g by a Place where there are &s;ome $u&s;es, tho' not a Town, and where the $ad goes clo&s;e to the River, whether $ Coachman did not &s;ee the Water, or &s;took it for the Water in the Road, I ow not, but he plunged in the Hor&s;es, $ach and all, into the River, and at a $ce where the Water was exceeding $p, and the Bank &s;teep; &s;o that if Help $ not come immediately from a Gentle|$'s Hou&s;e, which was clo&s;e to the $d the Servants crying our loud enough $larm them, his Grace, and a Gentle|$ who was in the Coach with him, had unavoidably peri&s;hed; and, as it was, he was a con&s;iderable Time under Water, &s;o that he was in the Extremity of Dau|ger.</P>
<P>I might go back here to the Hi&s;tory of the Order of the Garter, the In&s;tirution of which by King Edward III not only had its Original here, but &s;eems to be &s;eated here, as a Native of the Place; and that this is the Place where the Cere|monies of it, the In&s;talments, Fea&s;ts, &amp;c. are always to be performed: But this is done &s;o fully in other Authors, and by &s;o many, that it would be falling into that Error, which I condemn in others, and making my Accounts be, what I re&s;olv|ed, from the Beginning, they &s;hould not be; namely, a Copy of other Men's Per|formances. I &s;hall only give you out of Mr. A&s;hmole, a Li&s;t of the fir&s;t Knights who had the Honour of this Order, and who have been &s;ucceeded by &s;o many Kings, Dukes, and Sovereign Princes A|broad, as well as Noble-men, and Peers of this Kingdom at home.

<P>It is true, the&s;e were not all Noble|men, that is to &s;ay, not all Peers, nei|ther does the in&s;titution confine the Or|der to &s;uch; but 'tis certain, they were all Men of great Characters and Stations, either in the Army, or in the civil Ad|mini&s;tration, and &s;uch as the Sovereign did not think it below him to make his Companions; for &s;o they are ca led.</P>
<P>The lower Court, as I mentioned, of the Ca&s;tle, thougt not $o beautiful, for the &s;tately Lodgings, Rooms of State, &amp;c. is part$cular glorious for this fine Chapel of the Order, a mo&s;t beautiful and magnificent Work, and which &s;hews the Greatne&s;s, not only of the Court in tho&s;e Days, but the Spirit and Genius of the magnanimous Founder. The Chap|pel is not only fine within, but the Workman&s;h p without is extraordinary; nothing &s;o ancient is to be $een very beautiful. The Chappel of St. Stephen's in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, called Henry VIIth's Chapel, and King's College Chap|pel at Cambridge, built by Henry VI. are fine Buildings; but they are Modern, compared to this, which was begun, as by the in&s;cribed Dates upon the Works appears, in the Year 1337.</P>
<P>The Coats of Arms&punc; and the various Imagery, &amp;c. even in&s;ide and out&s;ide, not only of the King, but of &s;everal of fir&s;t Knights Companions, are mo&s;t ad|mirably fini&s;hed, and the Work has &s;tood out the injury of Time to Admiration; the Beauty of the Building remains with|out any Addition, and, indeed, requiring none</P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable, that King Edward owns this Chapel was begun by his Ance&s;tors, and &s;ome think it was by King Edward I. and that he him&s;elf was baptized in it, and that there was a Ca&s;tle built by Wil|liam the Conqueror al&s;o: But to the Chap|pel, which was then called a Church, or a Convent, King Edward III. did not pull down the old Building intirely, but he added all the Choir to the fir&s;t Mo|del, and &s;everal other proper Parts for the Purpo&s;es intended; as Hou&s;es and hand&s;ome Apartments for the Canons, Dignitaries, and other Per&s;ons belonging to the Church, which are generally $$|tuated on the North &s;ide of the Square, out of Sight, or rather &s;creen'd from the common View by the Church it&s;elf, which Dwellings are, notwith&s;tanding, very good, and well accommodated for the Per&s;ons who are Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them; then the King fini&s;hed it in the Manner we now &s;ee it: As for the old Ca&s;tle, the Building of William the Conqueror, the King pull'd it in&s;$ely down, ev n to the Foundation, forming a new Build|ing according to the pre&s;ent Plan, and which &s;tood, as above, to the Time of King Charles II. without any Al$$r|ation.</P>
<P>The E&s;tabli&s;hment for this Chapel was very con&s;iderable, by the Donation of divers Subjects, before it was let apart to be the Chappel of the Order; the Duke of Suffolk in particular, as appears in Dugdale's Mona&s;ticon, gave near Three Thou&s;and Acres, of Land Nineteen Man|nors, One Hundred Seventy Me&s;&s;uages and Tofts, and &s;everal Advow&s;ons of Churches to it, which, with other Gifts afterwards, made the Revenue above One Thou&s;and Pounds a Year in tho&s;e Days, which was a prodigious Sum, as Money went at that Time.</P>
<P>In the Choir are the Stalls for the Knights of the Order, with a Throne for the Sovereign; al&s;o Stalls in the mid|dle of it for the poor Knights Pen&s;ion|ers, who live in their Hou&s;e or Ho&s;pital on the South &s;ide of the Square or Court which the Church &s;tands in.</P>
<P>Here are to be &s;een, the Banners of the Knights who now enjoy the Honour of the Garter: When they die, tho&s;e Ban|ners are taken down, and the Coats of Arms of the decea&s;ed Knight &s;et up in the Place alloted for tho&s;e Arms over the &s;ame Stall, &s;o that tho&s;e Coats of Arms are a living Hi&s;tory, or rather a Record of all the Knights that ever have been &s;ince the fir&s;t iu&s;titntion of the

Order, and how they &s;ucceed one ano|ther; by which it appears, that Kings, Emperors and Sovereign Princes, have not thought it below them to accept of the Honour of being Knights Companions of this Order; while, at the &s;ame Time, it mu&s;t be noted to the Honour of the Engli&s;h Crown, that our Kings have ne|ver thought fit to accept of any of their Orders Abroad, of what kind &s;oever, whether Popi&s;h or Prote&s;tant; that of the Cordon Blue, or the Cordon Blanc, the Cordon Noir, or the Cordon Rouge, the Golden Fleece of Spain, the Holy Gho&s;t of France, or the Black Eagle of Pru&s;&s;ia, or any other; whereas of the Garter, there is an Account by the Regi&s;ter of the Order, that there are reckoned up of this mo&s;t Noble Company.</P>

<P>As the upper Court and Building are fronted with the fine Terrace as above, &s;o the lower Court, where this fine Chappel &s;tands, is walled round with a very high Wall, &s;o that no Building, if there was Room for any, could over|look it, which Wall goes round the We&s;t End of the Court to the Gate, which looking South, leads into the Town, as the Gate of the upper Court looks like|wi&s;e S.

<P>The Lodges in tho&s;e Parks, are no more Lodges, tho' they retain the Name, but Palaces, and might pa&s;s for &s;uch in other Countries; but as they be eclip&s;|ed by the Palace it&s;elf, &s;o it need only be added. That tho&s;e Lodges are prin|cipally beautified by the Grandeur of the Per&s;ons to whom the Po&s;t of Rang|ers have been a&s;&s;igned, who having been inriched by other Advancements, Hon|ours and profitable Employments, thought nothing too much to lay out to beau|tify their Apartments, in a Place, which it was &s;o much to their Honour, as well as Conveniency, to re&s;ide; &s;uch is the Lodge, which belongs to Admiral Churchi$l, the Dutche&s;s of Marlborough and others.</P>
<P>I cannot leave Wind&s;or, without ta|king Notice, that we cro&s;&s;ed the Thames upon a Wooden Bridge, for all the Bridges on the River, between London and Ox|ford, are of Timber, for the Convenien|cy of the Barges: Here we &s;aw Eaton College, the fine&s;t School for what we call Grammar Learning, for it extends only to the Humanity Cla&s;, that is in Britain, or, perhaps, in Europe.</P>
<P>The Building, except the great School Room, is an$ient, the Chappel truly Gothick; but all has been repaired, at a very great Expence, out of the College Stock, within the&s;e few Years.</P>
<P>The Gardens are very fine, and ex|tended from the College, down, almo&s;t, to the Bank of the Thames; they are ex|tremely well planted, and perfectly well kept</P>
<P>This College was Founded by King Henry VI a Prince magnificent in his G$fts, &s;o the Encouragement of Learn|ing, to Profu&s;ion: Witne&s;s, be&s;ides this noble Foundation, that of King's College in Camb idge, to which the Scholars of Eaton are an ually removed.</P>

<P>The Number of Scholars in&s;tructed here, is &s;rm 400 to 550; but has not been $nder 400 for many Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Elections of Scholars for the Uni|ver&s;ity out of this School, is worth tak|ing Notice of: It being a Time of Jubilee to the School.</P>
<P>The Election is once every Year, and is made on the fir&s;t Tue&s;day in Augu&s;t. In order to the Election, there are depu|ted from King's College in Cambridge, Three Per&s;ons, viz.

The Youths thus cho&s;en, are not immediately removed from the School, but mu&s;t wait till Vacancies fall in the &s;aid King's College, to make Room to receive them; and as &s;uch Vacancies hap|pen, they are then called up, as they &s;tand in Seniority in the &s;aid Li&s;t, or Roll of Election.</P>
<P>When a Scholar from Eaton, comes to King's College, he is received upon the Foundation, and pur&s;ues his Studies there for Three Years, after which, he claims a Fellow&s;hip, unle&s;s forfeited in the Terms of the Statutes; that is to $ay, by Mar|riage, accepting of Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Prefer|ments, &amp;c.

<HEAD>JOURNEY V.</HEAD>
<P>AS I am now near the Center of this Work, &s;o I am to de&s;cribe the great Center of England, the City of London, and Parts adjacent. This great Work is infinitely difficult in its Particulars, though not in it&s;elf; not that the City is &s;o difficult to be de&s;cribed but to do it in the nar|row Compa&s;s of a Letter, which we &s;ee &s;o fully takes up two large Volumes in Folio, and which, yet, if I may ven|ture to give an Opinion of it, is done but by Halves neither.</P>
<P>However, be the Ta&s;k difficult, as it is, yet it mu&s;t be done; to be con|ci&s;e and &s;hort, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; to be plain and &s;ignificant, as nece&s;|&s;ary; I &s;hall ob&s;erve both, as near as I can.</P>
<P>London, as a City only, and as its Walls and Liberties line it out, might, indeed be viewed in a &s;mall Compa&s;s; but, when I &s;peak of London, now in the Modern Acceptation, you expect I &s;hall take in all that va&s;t Ma&s;s of Build|ings, reaching from Black-Wall in the Ea&s;t, to Tothill-Fields in the We&s;t, and extended in an unequal Breadth, from the Bridge, or River, in the South, to I&s;lington North; and from Petersburgh-Hou&s;e on the Bank Side in We&s;tmin&s;ter, to Cavendi&s;h Square, and all the new Buildings by, and beyond Hanover-Square, by which the City of London, for &s;o it is &s;till to be called, is extended to Hyde Park Corner in the Brentford Road, and almo&s;t to Marybone in the Acton Road, and how much farther it may &s;pread, who knows? New Squares and new Streets ri&s;ing up every Day to &s;uch a Prodigy of Buildings, that nothing in the World does, or ever did, equal it, except old Rome in Trojan's Time, when the Walls were Fifty Miles in Compa&s;s, and the Number of Inhabi|tants &s;ix Millions eight hundred thou|&s;and Souls.</P>
<P>It is the Di&s;a&s;ter of London, as to the Beauty of its Figure, that it is thus &s;tretched out in Buildings, ju&s;t at the Plea&s;ure of every Builder, or Undertaker of Buildings, and as the Convenience of the People directs&punc; whether for Trade, or otherwi&s;e; and this has &s;pread the Face of it in a mo&s;t &s;traggling, confus'd Manner, out of all Shape, uncompact, and unequal; neither long or broad, round or &s;quare; whereas the City of Rome, though a Mon&s;ter for its Greatne&s;s&punc; yet was, in a manner, round, with very few irregularities in its &s;hape.</P>
<P>At London, including the Buildings on both &s;ides the Water, one &s;ees it, in &s;ome Places, three Miles broad, as from St. George's in Southwark&punc; to Shoreditch in Middle&s;ex; or two Miles, as from Peterburgh Hou&s;e to Montague Hou&s;e; and in &s;ome Places, not half a Mile, as in Wapping; and much le&s;s, as in Redriff.</P>
<P>We &s;ee &s;everal Villages, formerly &s;tand|ing, as it were, in the Country, and at a great Di&s;tance, now $oyn'd to the Streets by continual Buildings, and more making ha&s;te to meet in the like man|ner; for Example, 1. Deptford, this
<PB REF="205">
Town was formerly reckoned, at lea&s;t two Miles off from Redriff, and that over the Mar&s;hes too, a Place unlikely ever to be inhabited; and yet now, by the Encrea&s;e of Buildings in that Town it$elf, and the many Streets erected at Redriff, and by the Docks and Building-Yards on the River &s;ide, which &s;tand between both, the Town of Deptford, and the Streets of Redriff, or Rother|$$$$ (as they write it) are effectually j$yn'd and the Buildings daily increa&s;ing; &s;o that Deptford is no more a &s;eparated Town, but is become a Part of the great Ma&s;s, and infinitely full of People al&s;o: Here they have, within the lea&s;t two or three Years, built a fi$e new Church, and were the Town of D$p$ford now &s;eparated, and rated by it&s;elf. I believe it contains more People, and &s;tands upon more Ground, than the City of York.</P>
<P>The Town of $&s;lington, on the North &s;ide of the City, is in like manner joyn'd to the Streets of London, excepting one &s;mall Field, and which is in it&s;elf &s;o &s;mall, that there is no Doubt, but in a very few Years, they will be intirely joyn'd, and the &s;ame be &s;aid of Mile&punc;End, on the Ea&s;t End of the Town.</P>
<P>Newington, called Newington-Butts, in Sur$ey, reaches out her Hand North, and is &s;o near joining to Southwark, that it cannot now be properly called a Town by it&s;elf, but a Suburb to the Borough, and if, as they now tell us is underwritten, St. George's Fields &s;hould be built into Squares and Streets, a very little Time will &s;hew us Newington, Lambeth, and the Borough, all making but one South|wark.</P>
<P>That We&s;tmin&s;ter is in a fair way to &s;hake Hands with Chel&s;ea, as St. Giles's is with Marybone; and Great Ru&s;&s;el|&s;treet by Montague-Hou&s;e, with Tot|tenham-Court; all this is very evident, and yet all the&s;e put together, are &s;till to be called London: Whither will this mon&s;trous City then extend? and where mu&s;t a Circumvallation or Communication Line of it be placed.</P>
<P>I have, as near as I could, cau&s;ed a mea&s;ure to be taken of this mighty, I cannot &s;ay uniform, Body; and for the Satisfaction of the Curious, I have here given as accurate a De&s;cription of it, as I can do in &s;o narrow a Compa&s;s, as this of a Letter, or as I could do without drawing a Plan, or Map of the Places.</P>
<P>As I am forced, in many Places, to take in &s;ome unbuilt Ground, &s;o I have, on the other Hand, been obliged to leave a great many whole Streets of Buildings out of my Line: So that I have $eally not &s;tretched my Calculations, to make it &s;eem bigger than it is; nor is there any Oc a&s;ion of it.</P>

<P>$hus the Extent or Circumference of continued Buildings of the Cities of $don and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and Borough $outhwark, a$l which in the common $ptation, is called London, amounts Thirty Six Miles, Two Furlongs, $y Nine Rods:</P>
<P>N. B. The Town of Greenwich, which may, indeed, be &s;aid to be contiguous to Deptford, might be al&s;o called a Part of this Mea&s;urement; but I omit it as I have the Towns of Chel&s;ea and Knights bridge on the other Side, tho' both may be &s;aid to joyn the Town, and in a very few Years will certain|ly do &s;o.</P>
<P>Were it po&s;&s;ible to reduce all the&s;e Buildings to a compact Situation, 'tis ge|nerally thought, that the whole Body &s;o put together, allowing the nece&s;&s;ary Ground, which they now employ for the &s;everal Trades in the Out-parts&punc; &s;uch as the Building Yards by the River, for Shipwrights, Tanners Yards, Dyers, Whit&s;|ters, &amp;c. I &s;ay, 'tis believed the whole would take up Forty Eight Miles in Circumference, very compactly built.</P>
<P>The Gue&s;&s;es that are made at the Num|ber of Inhabitants, have been variou&s;ly form'd; Sir William Petty, famous for his Political Arithmetick, &s;uppo&s;ed the City, at his la&s;t Calculation, to contain a $word$ of People and this he judges from the Number of Births and Burials; and by this Rule, as well by what is well known of the Increa&s;e of the &s;aid Births and Burials, as of the prodigious Increa&s;e of Buildings, it may be very rea&s;onable to conclude, the pre&s;ent Number of Inhabi|tants within the Circumference I have mentioned, to amount to&punc; at lea&s;t, Fifteen Hundred Thou&s;and, with this Addition, that it is &s;till prodi$i$ou&s;ly increa&s;ing</P>
<P>Nor is it hard to account for this In|crea&s;e of People, as well as Buildings in London; but the Di&s;cour&s;e &s;eems too Po|litical to belong to this Work, which, rather, relates to the Fact than the Rea|&s;on of it and is properly to de&s;cribe the Thing, not to &s;hew why it is &s;o, for which Rea&s;on I omit entring into the En|quiry.</P>
<P>The Government of this great Ma&s;s of Building, and of &s;uch a va&s;t collected Bo|dy of People, though it con&s;i&s;ts of vari|ous Parts, is, perhaps, the mo&s;t regular
<PB REF="210">
and well ordered Government, that any Cry, of above half its Magnitude, can boa&s;t of</P>
<P>The Government of the City of Lon|don in particular, and ab&s;tractedly con&s;i|dered, is, by the Lord Mayor, Twenty Four Aldermon, Two Sheriffs, the Re|corder and Com$ n Council; but the Juri&s;diction of the&s;e is confined to that Part only, which they ca$l the City and its Liberties, which are marked ou$ ex|cept the Borough, by the Walls and the Bars, as they are called, and which the particular Maps of the City have exactly fin'd out, to which I refer.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the Lord Mayor and Al|dermen of London have a right $word$ as above, in the Borough of South$mark, as Con&s;ervators of the Bridge, and the Bridge it&s;elf is their particular Juri&s;d c|tion.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Lord Mayor, &amp;c. is Confer vator of the River Thames, from $word$ Bridge in Surry and Middle&s;ex$ $span$ River Medway in Kent, and $span$ in&s;i&s;t, up the Medway to Roche&s;ter Bridge.</P>
<P>The Government of the Out Part, is by J$$$ces of the Peace, and by the Sheriffs of London&punc; who are, $word$ Sheriffs of Middle&s;ex; and the Govern+ment of We&s;tmin&s;ter is by a High Bailiff con&s;tituted by the Dean $word$ Chapte$, $word$ whom the Civil Admini&s;tration $span$ committed.</P>
<P>The remaining Part of $span$ when the City Juri&s;diction $span$ is&punc; govern'd, al&s;o, by a $word$ $word$ and their proper &s;ub&s;tituted $eace $word$ excepting out of this the Privi|leges of the Mar&s;hal$cas, or of the Mar|&s;hal's Court, the Privilege of the Mar&s;hal of the King's Bench, the Mint, and the like.</P>
<P>To enter here, into a particular De|&s;cription of the City of London, its Anti|quities, &amp;c. would be only to make an Abridgment of Stow and his Continu$|tors, and would make a Volume by it|&s;elf; but while I write in manner of a Letter, and in the Per&s;on of an Itinerant, and give a cur&s;ory View of its pre&s;ent State, and to the Reader, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be upon the Spot, or near it, and who has the Benefit of all the Writers, who have already entered upon the De&s;cripti|on; it will I believe, be allowed to be agreeable and &s;ufficient to touch at tho&s;e Things principally, which no other Au|thors have yet mentioned, concerning this great and Wonderful Thing, called London.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>A Brief De&s;cription of the new Buildings erected in and about the Cities of <HI>LONDON</HI> and <HI>WESMINSTER</HI> and Borough of <HI>SOUTH|WARK,</HI> &s;ince the Year <HI>1666.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Account of new Buildings is to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of Hou&s;es rebuilt after the great Fire in London and Southwark,</P>
<P N="2">2. New Foundations, on Ground where never any Buildings were erected before.</P>
<P>Take, then, the City and its adjacent Buildings to &s;tand, as de&s;cribed by Mr. Stow, or by any other Author, who wrote before the Fire of London, and $he Difference between what it was $hen, and what it is now, may be ob|erved thus:</P>
<P>It is true, that before the Fire of $ondon, the Streets were narrow, and $ublick Edifices as well as private, were $ore crowded, and built clo&s;er to one nother; for &s;oon after the Fire, the $ing, by his Proclamation, forbid all erlons what&s;oever, to go about to re|$ild for a certain Time, viz. till the $rliament (which was &s;oon to &s;it) $ght regulate and direct the manner of $ilding, and e&s;tabli&s;h Rules for the ad|$ing every Man's Property, and yet $ght take Order for a due inlarging of $word$ Streets, and appointing the manner Building, as well for the Beauty as Conveniency of the City, and for $ety, in Ca&s;e of any future Accident; for though I &s;hall not inquire, whether the City was burnt by Accident, or by Treachery, yet nothing was more cer|tain, than that as the City &s;tood before, it was &s;trangely expo&s;ed to the Di&s;a&s;ter which happen'd, and the Buildings look'd as if they had been form'd to make one ge|neral Bonefire, whenever any wicked Party of Incendiaries &s;hould think fit.</P>
<P>The Streets were not only narrow, and the Hou&s;es all built of Timber, Lath and Plai&s;ter, or, as they were very pro|perly call'd Paper&punc;Work, and one of the fine&s;t Range of Buildings in the Temple, are, to this Day, called the Paper Build|ings, from that u&s;ual Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the manner of the Building in tho&s;e Days, one Story projecting out beyond another, was &s;uch, that in &s;ome narrow Streets, the Hou&s;es almo&s;t touch'd one another at the Top, and it has been known, that Men, in Ca&s;e of Fire, have e&s;caped on the Tops of the Hou$es, by leading from one &s;ide of a Street to an|other; this made it often, and almo&s;t always happen, that if a Hou&s;e was on Fire, the oppo&s;ite Hou&s;e was in more danger to be fired by it, according as the Wind &s;tood, than the Hou&s;es next adjoining on either &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB REF="212">
How this has been regulated, how it was before, and how much better it now is, I leave to be judged, by comparing the Old unburnt Part of the City with the New.</P>
<P>But tho' by the New Buildings after the Fire, much Ground was given up, and left unbuilt, to inlarge the $treets, yet 'tis to be ob&s;erved, that the Old Hou&s;es &s;tood &s;everally upon more Ground, were much larger upon the Flat, and in many Places, Gardens and large Yards about them, all which, in the New Build|ings, are, at lea&s;t, contracted, and the Ground generally built up into other Hou&s;es, &s;o that notwith&s;tanding all the Ground given up for beautifying the Streets, yet there are many more Hou&s;es built than &s;tood before upon the &s;ame Ground; &s;o that taking the whole City together, there are more Inhabitants in the &s;ame Compa&s;s, than there was before. To explain this more fully, I &s;hall give &s;ome particular In&s;tances, to which I re|fer, which there are living Witne&s;&s;es able to confirm: For Example.</P>
<P N="1">1. Swithen's Alleys by the Royal Ex|change, were all, before the Fire, taken up with One &s;ingle Merchant's Hou&s;e, and inhabited by one Mr. Swithin; whereas, upon the &s;ame Ground where the Hou&s;e &s;tood, &s;tands now about Twenty-two or Twenty four Hou&s;es, which belong to his Po&s;teri$y to this Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. Copt-Hall-Court in Throckmorton|&s;treet, was, before the Fire, al&s;o a &s;ingle Hou&s;e, inhabited by a Dutch Merchant; al&s;o three more Courts in the &s;ame Street, were &s;ingle Hou&s;es, Two on the &s;ame Side of the Way, and One on the other.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Alleys behind St. Chri&s;to|pher's Church, which are now vulgarly, but erroneou&s;ly, call'd St. Chri&s;topher's-Church yard, were, before the Fire, One great Hou&s;e, or, at lea&s;t, a Hou&s;e and Ware-hou&s;es belonging to it, in which the famous Mr. Kindrick lived, who&s;e Monu|ment now &s;tands in St. Chri&s;topher's Church&punc; and who&s;e Dwelling, al&s;o, took up almo&s;t all the Ground, on which now a Street of Hou&s;es is erected, called Prince's &s;treet, going through into Loth|bury, no &s;uch Street being known be|fore the Fire.</P>
<P>King's-Arms-Yard in Coleman-&s;treet, now built into fine large Hou&s;es, and in|habited by principal Merchants, was, be|fore the Fire, a Stable-yard for Hor&s;es and an Inn, at the Sign of the Kign's-Arms.</P>
<P>I might fill up my Account with many &s;uch In&s;tances, but 'tis enough to explain the Thing, viz. That &s;o many great Hou&s;es were converted into Streets and Courts, Alleys and Buildings, that there are, by E&s;timation, almo&s;t 4000 Hou&s;es now &s;tanding on the Ground which the Fire left de&s;olate, more than &s;tood on the &s;ame Ground before.</P>
<P>Another Increa&s;e of Buildings in the City, is to be taken from the Inhabitants in the unburnt Parts following the &s;ame Example, of pulling down great old Build|ings, which took up large Tracks of Ground in &s;ome of the well inhabited Places, and building on the &s;ame Ground, not only &s;everal Hou&s;es, but even whole Streets of Hou&s;es, which are &s;ince fully inhabited; for Example;</P>
<P>Crosby-Square within Bi&s;hop&s;gate, for|merly the Hou&s;e of Sir Jamess Langham Merchant.</P>
<P>Devon&s;hire - Square and Street, with &s;everal back Streets and Pa&s;&s;ages into Petticoat-lane one Way, and Houn&s;ditch another Way, all built on the Ground where the old Earl of Devon&s;hire had a Hou&s;e and Garden, and are all fully in|habited.</P>
<P>Bridgwater-Square, and &s;everal Streets adjoyning all fully inhabited, built on the Ground where the Earl of Bridgwater had a large Hou&s;e and Garden in Barbican.</P>
<P>Billeter Square, and &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages ad|joyning, built upon the Grounds of one great Hou&s;e&punc; in which, before that, one Merchant only lived.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e Palaces of the Nobility, formerly making a mo&s;t Beautiful Range of Buildings fronting the Strand, with their Gardens reaching to the Thames, where they had their particular Water|gates
<PB REF="213">
and Stairs, one of which remains &s;till, viz. York Hou&s;e, have had the &s;ame Fate, &s;uch as E&s;&s;ex, Norfolk, Salisbury, Worce&s;ter, Exceter, Hungerford, and York Hou&s;es; in the Place of which, are now &s;o many noble Streets and beautiful Hou|&s;es, erected, as are, in them&s;elves, equal to a lage City, and extend from the Tem|ple to Northumberland Hou&s;e; Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e and the Savoy, only intervening; and the latter of the&s;e may be &s;aid to be, not a Hou&s;e, but a little Town, being parted into innumerable Tenements and Apartments.</P>
<P>Many other great Hou&s;es have, by the Example of the&s;e, been al&s;o built into Streets, as Hatton-Hou&s;e in Holborn, and the old Earl of Bedford's great Garden, called New Convent Garden; but tho&s;e I omit, becau&s;e built before the Year 1666; but I may add the Lord Brook's Hou&s;e in Holborn; the Duke of Bedford's la&s;t re|maining Hou&s;e and Garden in the Strand, and many others.</P>
<P>The&s;e are prodigious Enlargements to the City, even upon that which I call In|habited Ground, and where infinite Num|bers of People now live, more than lived upon the &s;ame Spot of Ground before.</P>
<P>But all this is a &s;mall Matter compared to the New Foundations rai&s;ed within that Time, in tho&s;e which we ju&s;tly call the Out Parts: and not to enter on a particu|lar De&s;cription of the Buildings, I &s;hall only take Notice of the Places where &s;uch Enlargements are made; as, fir&s;t, within the Memory of the Writer hereof, all tho&s;e numberle&s;s Ranges of Building, cal|led Spittle Fields, reaching form Spittle|yard, at Northern Fallgate, and from Artillery Lane in Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet, with all the New Streets, beginning at Hox|ton, and the back of Shoreditch Church, North, and reaching to Brick-Lane, and to the End of Hare-&s;treet, on the Way to Bethnal Green, Ea&s;t; then &s;loping a|way quite to White Chappel Road, South Ea&s;t, containing, by good Ob&s;ervation, above Three hundred and Twenty Acres of Ground, which are all now clo&s;e built, and well inhabited with an infinite Num|ber of People, I &s;ay, all the&s;e have been built new from the Ground, &s;ince the Year 1666.</P>
<P>The Lanes were deep, dirty, and un|frequented, that Part now called Spittle|fields-Market, was a Field of Gra&s;s with Cows feeding on it, &s;ince the Year 1670. The Old Artillery Ground (where the Parliament Li&s;ted their fir&s;t Soldiers a|gain&s;t the King) took up all tho&s;e long Streets, leading out of Artillery Lane to Spittle-yard-back-gate, and &s;o on to the End of Wheeler-&s;treet.</P>
<P>Brick-lane, which is now a long well|pav'd Street, was a deep dirty Road, fre|quented chiefly by Carts fetching Bricks that Way into White Chapel from Brick-Kilns in tho&s;e Fields, and had its Name on that Account; in a Word, it is com|puted, that above Two Hundred Thou|&s;and Inhabitants dwell now in that Part of London, where, within about Fifty Years pa&s;t, there was not a Hou&s;e &s;tand|ing.</P>
<P N="2">2. On the more Ea&s;tern Part, the &s;ame Increa&s;e goes on in Proportion, namely, all Goodman's Fields, the Name gives Evidence for it, and the many Streets be|tween White-Chapel and Ro&s;emary Lane, all built &s;ince the Year 1678. Well Clo&s;e, now called Marine-&s;qare, was &s;o remote from Hou&s;es, that it u&s;ed to be a very danderous Place to go over after it was dark, and many People have been robbed and abu&s;ed in pa&s;&s;ing it; a Well &s;tand|ing in the middle, ju&s;t where the Dani&s;h Church is now built, there the Mi&s;chief was generally done; beyond this, all the hither or We&s;t End of Ratcliff-high-way, from the Corner of Gravel-Lane, to the Ea&s;t End of Ea&s;t Smith-field, was a Road over the Fields; likewi&s;e tho&s;e Buildings, now called Virginia-&s;treet, and all the Streets on the Side of Ratcliff-high-way to Gravel-lane above named.</P>
<P N="3">3. To come to the North Side of the Town, and beginning at Shoreditch, we&s;t, and Hoxton-&s;quare, and Charles's-&s;quare adjoyning, and the Streets intended for a Market-Place, tho&s;e were all open Fields, from Anni&s;eed-clear to Hoxton Town,

till the Year 1689, or thereabouts; Pit|field &s;treet, was a Bank, parting Two Pa&s;ture Grounds, and A&s;k's Ho&s;pital was another open field: Farther We&s;t, the like Addition of Building begins at the foot way, by the Pe&s;t-hou&s;e, and includes the French Ho&s;pital, Old&s;treet Two Squares, and &s;everal &s;treets, extending from Brick Lane to Mount Mill, and the Road to I&s;lington, and from that Road, &s;till We&s;t, to Wood's Clo&s;e, and to St. John's, and Clerkenwell, all which &s;treets and &s;quares are built &s;ince the Year 1688 and 1689, and were before that, and &s;ome for a long Time after, open fields or Gar|dens, and never built on till after that Time.</P>
<P>From hence we go on &s;till We&s;t, and beginning at Gray's-Inn&punc; and going on to tho&s;e formerly called Red-Lyon Fields, and Lamb's Conduit Fields, we &s;ee there a prodigious Pile of Buildings; it begins at Gray's Inn Wall towards Red Lyon|&s;treet, from whence, in a &s;trait Line, 'tis built quite to Lamb's Conduit Fields, North, including a great Range of Build|ings yet unfini&s;h'd, reaching to Bedford Row and the Cockpit, Ea&s;t, and includ|ing Red Lyon Square, Ormond-&s;treet, and the great New Square at the We&s;t End of it, and all the &s;treets between that Square and King's Gate in Hol|born, where is goes out; this Pile of Buildings is very great, the Hou&s;es &s;o magnificent and large, that abundance of Per&s;ons of Quality, and &s;ome of the Nobility are found among them, parti|cularly in Ormond-&s;treet, is the D&mdash;of Powis's Hou&s;e, built at the Expence of France, on Account of the former Hou&s;e being burnt, while the Duke D' Aumont, the French Amba&s;&s;ador Extra|ordinary lived in it; it i$ now a very noble Structure, tho' not large, built of Free-Stone, and in the mo&s;t exact man|ner, according to the Rules of Architec|ture, and is &s;aid to be, next the Banquet|ting Hou&s;e, the mo&s;t regular Building in this Part of England.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a very convenient Church, built by the Contribution of the Gentry inhabitants of the&s;e Buildings, tho' not yet made Parochial, being called St. George's Chapel.</P>
<P>Farther We&s;t, in the &s;ame Line, is Southampton great Square, called Bloom&s;|bury, with King-&s;treet on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of it, and all the numberle&s;s &s;treets We&s;t of the Square, to the Market Place, and through Great Ru&s;&s;el &s;treet by Mon|tague Hou&s;e, quite into the Hamp&s;tead Road, all which Buildings, except the old Building of Southampton Hou&s;e and &s;ome of the Square, has been form'd from the open Fields, &s;ince the Time above mentioned, and mu&s;t contain &s;eve|ral Thou&s;ands of Hou&s;es; here is al&s;o a Market, and a very hand&s;ome Church new built.</P>
<P>From hence, let us view the Two great Pari&s;hes of St. Giles's and St. Mar|tin's in the fields, the la&s;t &s;o increa&s;ed, as to be above 30 Years ago, formed in|to Three Pari&s;hes, and the other about now to be divided al&s;o.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of the Buildings here, is really a kind of Prodigy; all the Build|ings North of Long Acre, up to the Se|ven Dials, all the &s;treets, from Leice&s;ter Fields and St. Martin's Lane, both North and We&s;t, to the Hay Market and Soho, and from the Hay Market to St. James's &s;treet inclu&s;ive, and to the Park Wall; then all the Buildings on the North &s;ide of the &s;treet, called Piccadilly, and the Road to Knights Bridge, and between that and the &s;outh &s;ide of Tyburn Road, including Soho &s;quare, Golden &s;quare, and now Hanover &s;quare, and that new City on the North &s;ide of Tyburn Road, called Cavendi&s;h &s;quare, and all the &s;treets about it.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Addition, is by Calculation, more in Bulk than the Cities of Bri&s;tol, Exeter and York, if they were all put together; all which Places were, within the Time mentioned, meer fields of Gra&s;s, and employ'd only to feed Cattle as other fields are.</P>
<P><PB REF="215">
The many little Additions that might be named be&s;ides the&s;e, tho' in them|&s;elves con&s;iderable, yet being too many to give Room to here, I omit.</P>
<P>This is enough to give a view of the Difference between the pre&s;ent and the Greatne&s;s of this mighty City, called London.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Three Projects have been thought of, for the better regulating the Form of this mighty Building, which tho' not yet brought to Per|fection, may perhaps, in Time, be brought forwards, and if it &s;hould, would greatly add to the Beauty.</P>
<P N="1">1. Making another Bridge over the Thames.</P>
<P N="2">2. Making an Act of Parliament, a|brogating the Names as well as the Ju|ri&s;dictions of all the petty privileged Places, and joining or uniting the whole Body, Southwark and all, into One City, and calling it by one Name, LONDON.</P>
<P N="3">3. Forbidding the Extent of the Build|ings in &s;ome particular Places, where they too much run it out of Shape, and letting the more indented Parts &s;well out on the North and South &s;ide a little, to balance the Length, and bring the Form of the whole more near to that of a Circle, as particularly &s;topping the running out of the Buildings at the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Ends, as at Ratcliff and $word$ Ea&s;t, and at Tyburn and Ken|$$$$ton Roads, We&s;t, and encouraging the Buildings out at Moor-fields, Bun$ $il fields, the We&s;t &s;ide of Shoreditch, and &s;uch Places, and the North Part of Gray's Inn, and other adjacent Places, where the Buildings are not equally fil|$ed out, as in other Places, and the $ke in St. George's Fields and be|$ind Redriff on the other &s;ide of the $ater.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are &s;peculations only, and $u&s;t be left to the Wi&s;dom of future $ges. I return now, to &s;ome &s;hort De|$ription of the Parts; hitherto I have been upon the Figure and Extent of the City and its Out-Parts; I come now to &s;peak of the in&s;ide, the Buildings, the Inhabitants, the Commerce, and the manner of its Government, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the City being now rebuilt, has occa&s;ioned the building of &s;ome Publick Edifices even in the Place which was inhabited, which yet were not before, and the re-building others in a new and more magnificent manner than ever was done before.</P>
<P N="1">1. That beautiful Column, called the Monument, erected at the Charge of the City, to perpetuate the fatal Burn|ing of the Whole, cannot be mentioned but with &s;ome due Re&s;pect to the Build|ing it&s;elf, as well as to the City; it is Two hundred and Two Feet high, and in its Kind, out does all the Obeli&s;ks and Pillars of the Ancients, at lea&s;t that that I have &s;een, having a mo&s;t &s;tupen|dous Stair-Ca&s;e in the middle to mount up to the Balcony, which is about Thir|ty Feet &s;hort of the Top, and whence there are other &s;teps made even to look out at the Top of the whole Building; the Top is fa&s;hioned like an Um.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Canal or River, called Fleet|ditch, was a Work of great Magnifi|cence and Expence; but not an&s;wering the De&s;ign, and being now very much neglected, and out of Repair, is not much &s;poken of, yet it has Three fine Bridges over it, and a Fourth, not &s;o fine, yet u&s;e$ul as the re&s;t, and the Tide flowing up to the la&s;t; the Canal is very u&s;eful for bringing of Coals and Timber, and other heavy Goods; but the Warehou&s;es intended under the &s;treets, on either &s;ide, to lay up &s;uch Goods in, are not made U&s;e of, and the Wharfs in many Places are decay'd and fallen in, which make all look Ruinous.</P>
<P>The Royal Exchange, the greate&s;t and fine&s;t of tho Kind in the World, is the next publick Work of the Citizens, the Beauty of which an&s;wers for it&s;elf, and needs no De&s;cription here; 'tis ob&s;erv|able, that tho' this Exchange co&s;t the Citizens an immen&s;e Sum of Money $word$

building&punc; &s;ome Authors &s;ay, Eighty Thou|&s;and Pounds, being fini&s;hed and embelli&s;h|ed in &s;o exqui&s;ite a Manner, yet it was &s;o appropriated to the grand Affair of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, that the Rent or Income of it for many Years, fully an&s;wered the Intere&s;t of the Money laid out in Building it: Whether it does &s;o &s;till or not, I will not &s;ay, the Trade for Millenary Goods, fine Laces, &amp;c. which was &s;o great above Stairs for many Years, being &s;ince &s;cat|tered and removed, and the Shops, many of them, left empty; but tho&s;e Shops, of which there were Eight double Rows above, and the Shops and Offices round it below, with the Vaults under the whole, did $t fir&s;t, yield a very great Sum.</P>
<P>Among other publick Edi&s;ices, that of the Ho&s;pital of Bethlehem&punc; or Bedlam, &s;hould not be forgot, which is at the ve|ry Time of Writing this, appointed to be inlarged with Two new Wings, and will then be the mo&s;t magnificent Thing of its Kind in the World.</P>
<P>$ kewne the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, an acciden|tal Fire having demoli&s;hed Part of it, and given the Commi&s;&s;ioners Opportunity to take in more Ground, will, when it is fini&s;hed, out-&s;hine all the Cu&s;tom hou&s;es in Europe.</P>
<P>The Churches in London are rather convenient than fine, not adorned with Pomp and Pageantry as in Popi&s;h Coun|tries; but, like the true Prote&s;tant Plain|ne&s;s, they have made very little of Orna|ment either within them or without, nor, excepting a few, are they famous for hand|&s;ome Steeples, a great many of them are very mean, and &s;ome that &s;eem adorned, are rather deform'd than beaui&s;ied by the Heads that contrived, or by the Hands that built them.</P>
<P>Some, however, hold up their Heads with Grandeur and Magnificence, and are really Ornaments to $he whole, I mean by the&s;e, &s;uch as Bow, St. Brides, the new Church in the Strand, Rood Lane Church, or St. Margaret Pattons, St. Antholins, St Clement Danes, and &s;ome others, and &s;ome of the fifty Churches, now adding by the Bounty and Charity of the Government, are like to be very well adorned.</P>
<P>Three or Four Gothick Towers have been rebuilt at the proper Expences of the Fund appointed, and are not the wor&s;t in all the City, namely St Michael at Corn|hill, St. Dun&s;tan in the Ea&s;t, St. Chri&s;to|phers, St. Mary Aldermary, and at St. Sepulchre's.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of all the Churches in the City, and of all the Porte&s;tant Churches in the World, is the Cathedral of St. Paul's; a Building exceeding Beau|tiful and Magnificent; tho' &s;ome Authors are plea&s;ed to expo&s;e their Ignorance, by pretending to find Fault with it: 'Tis ea&s;y to find Fault with the Works even of God him&s;elf, when we view them in the Gro&s;s, without regard to the particular Beauties of every Part &s;eparately con&s;idered, and without &s;earching into the Rea&s;on and Nature of the Particulars; but when the&s;e are maturely inquired into viewed, with a ju&s;t Reverence, and con&s;idered with judg|ment, then we fly out in due Admirations of the Wi&s;dom of the Author from the Excellency of his Works.</P>
<P>The va&s;t Extent of the Dome, that mighty Arch, on which &s;o great a Weight is &s;upported (meaning the upper Towers or Lanthorn of Stone Work Seventy Feet high) may well account for the &s;trength of the Pillars and Butments below; yet tho&s;e common Ob&s;ervers of the &s;uperfi|cial Parts of th$ Building, complain, that the Columns are too gro&s;s, that the Work looks heavy, and the lower Figures near the Eye are too large, as if the $word$ and the A$tick were not each of $word$ beautiful in their Place as the Corinth$$$.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e Architect, like a complea$ Ma&s;ter of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, had the Satisfacti|on, in his Life-time, of hearing tho&s;e ig|norant Reprovers of his Work confuted, by the Approbation of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters in Europe; and the Church of St. Peter's in Rome, which is owned to be the mo&s;t fini&s;hed Piece in the World, only exceeds St Paul's in the Magnificence of its in|&s;ide Work; the Painting, the Altars, the Oratories, and the $word$ of its Imagery&punc;

<P>If all the Square Columns, the great $lla&s;ters, and the Flat Pannel Work, as $ell within as without, which they now edge are too heavy and look too gro&s;s, $ere filled with Pictures, adorned with $rved Work and Gilding, and crowded $th adorable Images of the Saints and $gels, the kneeling Crowd would not $mplain of the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Work; t 'tis the Prote&s;tant Plainne&s;s, that di|&s;ting tho&s;e Columns, &amp;c. of their Or|ments, makes the Work, which in $word$ is not &s;o large and gro&s;s as $word$ at of St. ter's, be called gro&s;s and heavy; where-neither by the Rules of Order, or by $word$ Nece&s;&s;ity of the Building, to be pro|$tioned and &s;ufficient to the height and $ight of the Work, could they have $n le&s;s, or any otherwi&s;e than they $word$.</P>
<P>Nay, as it was, tho&s;e Gentlemen who Parliament oppo&s;ed Sir Chri&s;topher $en's Reque&s;t, of having the Dome co|$ed with Copper, and who moved to $word$ had the Lanthorn on the Top made $rter, and built of Wood; I &s;ay, tho&s;e $ntlemen pretending Skill in the Art. $word$ offering to reproach the Judgment of $word$ Architect, alledged, That the Copper $word$ the Stone Lanthorn would be to $word$ and that the Pillars below would not $port it.</P>
<P>To which Sir Chri&s;topher an&s;wered, $at he had &s;u&s;tained the Building with $word$ &s;ufficient Columns, and the Bu$tment $word$ every where &s;o good, that he would $wer for it with his Head, that it &s;hould $word$ the Copper Covering and the Stone $thorn, and &s;even thou&s;and Ton weight $word$ upon it more than was propo&s;ed, and $word$ nothing below &s;hould give way, no $word$ One half quarter of an Inch; but $word$ on the contrary, it &s;hould be all the $er and &s;tronger for the weight that $ld be laid on it; adding, That it was $word$ this View that the Work was brought $word$ its Foundation in &s;uch manner, $ade common Ob&s;ervers rather think the fir&s;t Range of the Buildings too gro&s;s for its upper Part; and that, if they plea&s;|ed, he would undertake to rai&s;e a Spire of Stone upon the whole, a hundred Foot higher than the Cro&s;s now &s;tands.</P>
<P>When all the&s;e Things are con&s;idered complexly, no Man that has the lea&s;t Judgment in Building, that knows any Thing of the Rules of Proportion, and will judge impartially, can find any Fault in this Church; on the contrary, tho&s;e excellent Lines of Mr. Dryden, which were too meanly applied in Allegory to the Prai&s;e of a paltry Play, may be, wi$h much more Honour to the Author, and Ju&s;tice to this Work, be applied here to St. Paul's Church.</P>
<LG>
<L>Strong Dorick Pillars form the Ba&s;e,</L>
<L>Corinthian fills the upper Space;</L>
<L>So all below is Strength, and&punc;all above is Grace.</L>
</LG>
<P>Sir Chri&s;topher's De&s;ign was, indeed, very unhappily baulked in &s;everal Things at the beginning, as well in the Situation as in the Conclu&s;ion of this Work, which, becau&s;e very few may have heard of, I &s;hall mention in Publick, from the Mouth of its Author.</P>
<P N="1">I. In the Situation: He would have had the Situation of the Church removed a little to the North, that it &s;hould have &s;tood ju&s;t on the &s;pot of Ground which is taken up by the Street called Pater no&s;ter-Row, and the Buildings on either Side; &s;o that the North-&s;ide of the Church &s;hould have &s;tood open to the Street now called Newgate-&s;treet, and the South &s;ide, to the Ground on which the Church now &s;tands.</P>
<P>By this Sitnation, the Ea&s;t End of the Church, which is very beautiful, would have looked directly down the main Street of the City, Cheap&s;ide; and for the We&s;t End, Ludgate having been removed a lit|tle North, the main Street called Ludgate-&s;tree$ and Ludgate hill, would only have &s;loped a little W. S. W. as they do now irregularly two ways, one within, and the other without the Gate, and all the
<PB REF="220">
Street beyond Fleet-Bridge would have received no Alterarion at all.</P>
<P>By this &s;ituation, the common Tho|rough-fare of the City would have been removed at a little farther Di&s;tance from the Work, and we &s;hould nor then have been obliged to walk ju&s;t under the very W$ll as we do now, which makes the Work appear quite out of all Per&s;pective, and is the chief Rea&s;on of the Objecti|ons I$ &s;peak of; whereas, had it been viewed at a little Di&s;tance, the Building would have been &s;een infinitely to more Advantage.</P>
<P>Had Sir Chri&s;topher been allowed this Situation, he would then, al&s;o, have had more Room for the Ornament of the We&s;t End, which, tho' it is a mo&s;t beautiful Work, as it now appears, would have been much more &s;o then, and he would have added a Circular Piazza $o it, after the Model of that at Ro$e, but much more Magnificent, and an Obelisk of Marble in the Center of the Circle, exceeding any Thing that the World can now &s;hew of its kind, I mean of Modern Work</P>
<P>But the $ircum&s;tance of Things hin|dered this Noble De&s;ign and the City being almo&s;t rebuilt before he obtained $word$ $word$ and Provi&s;ion for &s;aying the Foundation; he was pre&s;cribed to the narrow Spot where we &s;ee it now &s;tands, in which the Buildidg, however Mag|finicent in it&s;elf, &s;tands with infinite Di&s;advantage as to the Pro&s;pect of it; the Inconveniencies of which was &s;o ap|parent when the Church was fini&s;hed, that Leave was at lengh, tho' not with|out difficulty, obtained, to pull down one whole Row of Hou&s;es on the North Side of the Body of the Church, to make Way for the Balli&s;ter that &s;urrounds the Cimetry or Church-yard, and&punc; indeed, to admit the Light into the Church, as well as to pre&s;erve it from the Danger of Fire.</P>
<P>Another Baulk which as I &s;aid, Sir Chri&s;topher met with, was in the Con|clu&s;ion of the Work, namely, the cover|ing of the Dome, which Sir Chri&s;topher would have had been of Copper double Gilded; but he was over-ruled by Par$y, and the City thereby, deprived of the mo&s;t glorious Sight that the World eve$ &s;aw, &s;ince the Temple of Solomon.</P>
<P>Yet with all the&s;e Di&s;advantages, the Church is a mo&s;t regular Building, Beau|tiful Magnificent, and beyond all the Modern Works of it$ Ki$k in Europe, St. Peter's at Rome, as above, only excepted.</P>
<P>It is true, St. Peter's, be&s;ides its Beauty in Ornament and Im gery, is beyond St Paul's in its $word$ i$ every way larger; but it is the only Church in the World that is &s;o; and it was a merty Hyperbole of Sir Chri&s;to|pher Wren's, who when &s;ome Gentle|men in Di&s;cour&s;e compared the Two Churches, and in Compliment to him, pretended to prefer St. Paul's, and when they came to &s;peak of the Dimen&s;ions, &s;ugge&s;ted, that St. Paul's was the big|ge&s;t: <HI>I tell you,</HI> &s;ays Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher, you might &s;ee it in St.</HI> Peter's, <HI>and look for it a good while, before $word$ could find it.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus &s;poken of the City and adjacent Buildings of London, a d of the P$$ticulars which I find chiefly o|mitted by other Writers, I have not Room here to enter into all the Arti|cles needful to a full De&s;cription: How|ever, I &s;hall touch a little at the Thi gs mo&s;t de&s;erving a &s;tranger's Ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing now, the whole Body of this va&s;t Building to be con&s;idered as one City, London, and not concerning my&s;elf or the Reader with the Di&s;tin ti|on of its &s;everal Juri&s;dictions; we &s;hall then ob&s;erve it only as divided into Three&punc; viz. the City, the Court, and the Ou$ Parts.</P>
<P>The City is the Center of its Com|merce and Wealth.</P>
<P>The Court of its Gallantry and Splen|dor.</P>
<P>The Out parts of its Numbers and Mechanicks, and in all the&s;e, no City $o the World can $word$</P>
<P><PB REF="221">
Between the Court and City, there is a $n&s;tant Communication of Bu&s;ine&s;s to $at Degree, that nothing in the World $an come up to it.</P>
<P>As the City is the Center of Bu&s;ine&s;s; $$re is the Cu&s;tom hou&s;e, an Article, $hich as it brings in an immen&s;e Re|$enue to the Publick, &s;o it cannot be $moved from its Place, all the va&s;t $$port and Export of Goods being, of $ece&s;&s;ity, made there; nor can the Mer|$hants be removed, the River not ad|$itting the &s;hips to come any farther.</P>
<P>Here, al&s;o, is the Exci$e Office, the $avy-Office, the Bank, and almo&s;t all $e Offices where tho&s;e va&s;t Funds are $ed, in which &s;o great a Part of the $ation are concerned, and on the &s;ecu|$ty of which &s;o many Millions are ad|$anced.</P>
<P>Here are the South Sea Company, $e Ea&s;t India Company, the Bank&punc; the $frican Company, &amp;c. who&s;e Stocks $pport that prodigious Paper Commerce, $word$ Stock-Jobbing; a Trade, which $nce bewitched the Nation almo&s;t to its $$in, and which, tho' reduced very $uch, and recover'd from that terrible $$atuation which once over&s;pread the $hole Body of the People, yet is &s;till $ Negotiation, which is &s;o va&s;t in its $xtent, that almo&s;t all the Men of &s;ub|$ance in England are more or le&s;s con|erned in it, and the Property of which $ &s;o very alienated, that even the Tax $pon the Trans&s;ers of Stock, tho' but $ve Shillings for each Transfer, brings $any thou&s;and Pounds a Year to the $overnment; and &s;ome have &s;aid that $word$ is not le&s;s than a hundred Milli|$s of Stock transferred forward or back|$ard from one Hand to another every $ear, and this is one thing which makes $ch a con&s;tant Daily intercour&s;e between $e Court Part of the Town, and the $ty; and this is given as one of the $incipal Cau&s;es of the prodigious Con|$x of the Nobility and Gentry from $ Parts of England to London, more $an ever was known in former Years, $word$. That many thou&s;ands of Families are &s;o deeply concerned in tho&s;e Stocks, and find it &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be at Hand to take the Advantage of buy|ing and &s;elling, as the &s;udden Ri&s;e or Fall of the Price directs and the Lo&s;s they often &s;u&s;tain by their Ignorance of Things when ab&s;ent, and the Knavery of Brokers and others, whom&punc; in their Ab&s;ence, they are bound to tru&s;t, that they find $word$ obliged to come up and live con&s;tantly here, or at lea&s;t, mo&s;t Part of the Year.</P>
<P>This i$ the $word$ why, nowith&s;tand|ing $he $$$rea$e of n$w Buildings, and the $word$ o$ new Cities, as they may be called, every Year to the old yet a Hou&s;e is no &s;ooner built, but 'tis te|nanted $span$ and every Part is crowd&punc; with People, and that not only in the Towns, bu$ in all the Towns and Villages round, as &s;hall be taken Notice of in its Place.</P>
<P>But let the Citizens and Inhabitants of London know, and it may be worth the Reflection of &s;ome of the Landlords, and Builders e&s;pecially that it Fea$e continues, and the publick Affairs con|tinue in hone&s;t and upright Manage|ment, there is a Time coming, at lea&s;t the Nation hopes for it, when the pub|lick Debts being reduced and paid off, the Funds or Taxes on which they are e&s;tabli&s;h'd, may cea&s;e, and &s;o Fifty or Sixty Millions of the $word$ which are now the &s;olid Bottom of the South Sea Company, Ea&s;t India Company, Bank, &amp;c. will cea&s;e, and be no more; by which the Rea&s;on of this Conflux of People being removed, they will of Cour&s;e, and by the Nature of the Thing, return again to their Country Seats&punc; to avoid the expen&s;ive living at London, as they did come up hither to &s;hare the extravagant Gain of their former Bu&s;ine&s;s here.</P>
<P>What will be the Condition of this overgrown City in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, I mu&s;t leave to Time; but all tho&s;e who know the temporary Con&s;titution of our Funds, know this, 1. That even, if they are to &s;pin out their own Length, all tho&s;e Funds
<PB REF="222">
which were given for Thirty-two Years, have already run out one Third, and &s;ome of them almo&s;t half the Time, and that the re&s;t will &s;oon be gone: 2.

In|tere&s;t, will be able every Year to be pay|ing off and le&s;&s;ening the publick Debt, 'till, in Time, 'tis to be hoped, all our Taxes may cea&s;e, and the ordinary Reve|nue may, as it always u&s;ed to do, again &s;upply the ordinary Expence of the Go|vernment.</P>
<P>Then, I &s;ay, will be a Time to expect the va&s;t Concour&s;e of People to London, will &s;eparate again and di&s;per&s;e as natur|ally, as they have now crouded hither: What will be the Fate then of all the fine Buildings in the out Parts, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, let any one judge.</P>
<P>There has formerly been a great Emu|lation between the Court End of the Town, and the City; and it was once &s;eriou&s;ly propo&s;ed in a certain Reign, how the Court &s;hould humble the City; nor was it &s;o impracticable a Thing at that Time, had the wicked Scheme been carried on: Indeed it was carried farther than con|&s;i&s;ted with the Prudence of a good Go|vernment, or of a wi&s;e People; for the Court envy'd the City's greatne&s;s, and the Citizens were ever jealous of the Court's De&s;igns: The mo&s;t fatal Steps the Court took to humble the City, and which, as I &s;ay, did not con&s;i&s;t with the Prudence of a good Government, were, 1. The &s;huting up the Exchequer, and, 2. The bringing a Quo Warranto again&s;t their Charter; but the&s;e Things can but be touch'd at here; the City has outliv'd it all, and both the Attempts turn'd to the Di&s;credit of the Court Party, who pu&s;hed them on: But the City, I &s;ay, has gained the A&s;cendant, and is now made &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Court (as before it was thought rather a Grievauce) that now we &s;ee the Court it&s;elf the daily In&s;trument to encourage and increa&s;e the Opulence of the City, and the City again, by its real Grandeur, made not a Glory only, but an A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Support to the Court, on the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;udden Emer|gencies.</P>
<P>Nor can a Breach be now made on any Terms, but the City will have the Ad|vantage; for while the Stocks, and Bank, and trading Companies remain in the Ci|ty, the Center of the Money, as well as of the Credit and Trade of the Kingdom, will be there.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e Capital Offices only ne|ce&s;&s;arily kept in the City, but &s;everal Offices belonging to the publick O$ conomy of the Admini&s;tration, &s;uch as the Po&s;t-office, the Navy, the Victual|ling, and the Pay-offices, including the Ordnance-office, which is kept in the Tower. In a Word, the Offices may, in deed, be &s;aid to be equally divided.</P>
<P>The City has all tho&s;e above-men$|oned, and the Court has the Admiralty, the Exchequer, and the Secretaries of State's Offices, with tho&s;e of the Pay-Ma&s;ters of the Army, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, the Council, the Parlia|ment, and the Courts of Ju&s;tice, are all kept at the &s;ame part of the Town: but as all Suits among the Citizens are, by Virtue of their Privileges, to be try'd within the Liberty of the City, &s;o the Term is obliged to be (as it were) adjour|ned from We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall to Guild Hail, to try Cau&s;es there; al&s;o Criminal Ca&s;es are in like Manner tried Monthly at the Old Baily, where a &s;pecial Comi&s;&s;ion is granted for that Purpo&s;e to the Judges; but the Lord Mayor always pre&s;ides, and has the Chair.</P>
<P>The Equality, however, being $word$ pre&s;erved, and a perfect good $word$ between the Court and City having &s;o long flouri&s;hed, this Union contribute$ greatly to the flouri&s;hing Circum&s;tances o$ both, and the publick Credit is greatly rai&s;ed by it; for it was never known$ that the City, on any Occa&s;ion, wa$ &s;o A&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Government. No $word$ is &s;o great, but the Bank has been able t$ rai&s;e. Here the Exchequer Bills are at $word$ Times circulated, Money advanced upo$ the Funds as &s;oon as laid, and that $word$
<PB REF="223">
moderate Intere&s;t, not incroaching on the Government, or extorting large Intere&s;t to eat up the Nation, and di&s;appoint the Sovereign, and defeat his be&s;t De&s;igns, as in King William's Time was too much the Practice.</P>
<P>By this great Article of publick Credit, all the King's Bu&s;ine&s;s is done with chear|fulne&s;s, Provi&s;ions are now bought to $$ctual the Fleers without Difficulty, and at rea&s;onable Rates. The &s;everal Yards where the Ships are built and fitted out, are currently paid: The Magazines of Millitary and Naval Stores kept full: In a Word, by this very Article of publick Credit, of which the Parliament is the Foundation (and the City, are the Archi|tectures or Builders) all tho&s;e great Things are now done with Ea&s;e, which, in the former Reigns, went on heavily, and were brought about with the utmo&s;t Dif|ficulty.</P>
<P>But, to return to the City; Be&s;ides the Companies and publick Offices, which are kept in City, there are &s;everal parti|cular Offices and Places, &s;ome built or repaired on Purpo&s;e, and others hired and beautified for the particular Bu&s;ine&s;s they carry on re&s;pectively: As,</P>
<P>Here are &s;everal great Offices for &s;ever|al Societies of En&s;urers; for here almo&s;t all Hazards may be en&s;ured; the Four principal are called, 1. Royal Exchange En&s;urance: 2. The London En&s;urers: 3. The Hand in Hand Fire office: 4. The Sun Fire office.</P>
<P>In the Two fir&s;t of tho&s;e, all Hazards by Sea are en&s;ured, that is to &s;ay, of $word$ Goods, not Lives; as al&s;o Hou&s;es and Goods are en&s;ured from Fire.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t, only Hou&s;es and Good$.</P>
<P>In all which Offices, the Premio is &s;o &s;mall, and the Recovery, in ca&s;e of Lo&s;s, to ea&s;y and certain, where no Fraud is &s;u&s;pected, that nothing can be &s;hewn like it in the whole World; e&s;pecially that of en&s;uring Hou&s;es from Fire, which has now attained &s;uch an univer&s;al&punc; Approba|tion, that I am told, there are above Seventy thou&s;and Hou&s;es thus en&s;ured in London, and the Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t India Hou&s;e is in Leadenhall-Street, an old, but &s;pacious Building; very convenient, though not beautiful, and I am told, it is under Con&s;ulation to have it taken down, and rebuilt with ad|ditional Buildings for Warehou&s;es and Cel|lars for their Goods, which at pre&s;ent are much want ed all which is of late per|form'd.</P>
<P>The African Company's Hou&s;e is in the &s;ame Street, a very hand&s;ome, well|built, and convenient Hou&s;e, and which fully &s;erves for all the Offices their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s requires.</P>
<P>The Bank is kept in Grocer's Hall&punc; a very convenient Place, and, con&s;idering its Situation, &s;o near the Exchange, a very &s;pacious, commodious Place.</P>
<P>Here Bu&s;ine&s;s is di&s;patch'd with &s;uch Exactne&s;s, and &s;uch Expedition and &s;o much of it too, that it is really prodigi|ous; no Confu&s;ion, no body is either de|nied or delayed Payment, the Merchants who keep their Ca&s;h there, are &s;ure to have their Bills always paid, and even Ad|vances made on ea&s;y Terms, if they have Occa&s;ion. No Accounts in the World are more exactly kept, no Place in the World has &s;o mu$h Bu&s;ine&s;s done, with &s;o much Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the next Street (the Old Jury) is the Exci&s;e Office, in a very large Hou&s;e, formerly the Dwelling of Sir John Fre|drick, and afterwards, of Sir Jo&s;eph Hern, very con&s;iderable Merchants. In this one Office is managed an immen&s;e Weight of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and they have in Pay, as I am told, near Four thou&s;and Officers: The whole Kingdom is divided by them into proper Di&s;tricts, and to every Di&s;trict, a Collector, a Supervi&s;or, and a certain Number of Gaugers, called, by the vul|gar Title Exci&s;e Men&punc;</P>
<P>Nothing can be more regular, than the Methods of this Office, by which an Account of the whole Exci&s;e is tran&s;mit|ted from the remote&s;t Parts of the King|dom, once every Six Weeks, which is called a S tring, and the Money received, or Pro&s;ecutions commenced for it, in the next Sitting.</P>
<P><PB REF="224">
Under the management of this Office, are now brought, not only the Exci&s;e upon Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, as formerly, but al&s;o the Duties on Malt and Candles, Hops, Soap, and Leather, all which are managed in &s;everal and di&s;tinct Cla&s;&s;es, and the Accounts kept in di&s;tinct Books; but, in many Places, are collected by the &s;ame Officers, which makes the Charge of the Collection much ea&s;ier to the Government: Nor is the like Duty collected in any Part of the World, with &s;o little Charge, or &s;o few Officers.</P>
<P>The South Sea Hou&s;e is &s;ituate in a large &s;pot of Ground, between Broad|&s;treet, and Threadneedle &s;treet, two large Hou&s;es having been taken in, to form the whole Office, but, as they were, notwith&s;tanding, &s;traighten'd for Room, and were obliged to &s;ummon their Ge|neral Courts in another Place, viz. At Merchant-Taylors Hall; &s;o they have now re&s;olved to erect a new and com|pleat Building for the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s, which is to be exceeding fine and large, and to this End, the Company has pur|cha&s;ed &s;everal adjacent Buildings, &s;o that the Ground is inlarged towards Thread|needle-&s;treet; but, it &s;eems, they could not be accommodated to their Minds on the &s;ide next Broad-&s;treet, &s;o we are told, they will not open a Way that Way, as before.</P>
<P>As the Company are enlarging their Trade to America, and have al&s;o engag|ed in a new Trade, namely, That of the Greenland Whale Fi&s;hing, they are like to have an Occa&s;ion to enlarge their Offices. This Building, they a&s;|&s;ure us, will co&s;t the Company, from ten to twenty thou&s;and Pounds, that is to &s;ay, a very great &s;um.</P>
<P>The Po&s;t Office, a Branch of the Re|venue formerly not much valued, but now, by the additional Penny upon the Letters, and by the vi&s;ible increa&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Nation, is grown very con&s;iderable. This Office maintains now, Pacquet Boats to Spain and Portugal, which never was done before: So the Merchants Letters for Cadiz or Lisbon, which were before two and twenty Days in going over France and Spain to Lisbon, oftentimes arrive there now, in nine or ten Days from Falmouth.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, they have a Pacquet from Mar&s;cilles to Port Mahone, in the Me|diterranean, for the con&s;tant communi|cation of letters with his Maje&s;ty's Gar|ri&s;on and People in the I&s;land of Mi|norca.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a Pacquet from Eng|land to the W$$$ Indies; but I am $word$ of Opinion, that they will k$ep it up for much Time longer, if it be not already let fall.</P>
<P>This Office is kept in Lombard &s;treet, in a large Hou&s;e, formerly Sir Robert Viner's, once a rich Gold&s;mith; but ru|ined at the &s;hutting up of the Exche|quer, as above.</P>
<P>The Penny Po&s;t, a modern Contri|vance of a private Per&s;on, one Mr. William Dockraw, is new made a Branch of the general Revenue by the Po&s;t-Of|fice; and though, for a Time, it was &s;ubject to Mi&s;carriages and Mi&s;takes, yet now it is come al&s;o into &s;o exqui&s;ite a Management, that nothing can be more exact, and 'tis more exact, and 'tis with the utmo&s;t &s;afety and di&s;patch, that Let|ters are delivered at the remore&s;t Cor|ners of the Town, almo&s;t as &s;oon as they could be &s;ent by a Me&s;&s;enger, and that from Four, Five, Six, to Eight Times a-Day, according as the Di&s;tance of the Place makes i$ practicable; and you may &s;end a Letter from Ratcliff or Limehou&s;e in the Ea&s;t, to the farthe&s;t Part of We&s;tmin&s;ter for a $word$ and that &s;everal times in the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>Nor are you tied up to a &s;ingle Peice of Paper, as in the General Po&s;t Office, but any Packet under a Pound weight, goes at the &s;ame Price.</P>
<P>I mention this the more particularly, becau&s;e it is &s;o manife&s;t a te&s;timony to the Greatne&s;s of this City, and to the great Extent of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Commerce in it, that this Penny conveyance &s;hould
<PB REF="225">
rai&s;e &s;o many thou&s;and Pounds in a Year, and $mploy &s;o many poor Peo|ple in the Diligence of it, as this Office employs.</P>
<P>We &s;ee nothing of this at Paris, at Am$etdam, at Hamburgh, or any other City, that ever I have &s;een, or heard of.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e I have ju&s;t men|tioned before, but mu&s;t take up a few Lines to mention it again. The &s;tate|line&s;s of this Building &s;hewed the Great|ne&s;s of the Bu&s;ine&s;s that is tran&s;acted there: The Long Room is like an Ex|change every Morning, and the Crowd of People who appear there, and he Bu&s;i|ne&s;s they do, is not to be $span$ by Words, nothing of that Kind in Eu$$pe $s like it.</P>
<P>Yet it has been found, that the Busi|ne&s;s of Export and Import in th$$ Port of London, is &s;o prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed, $nd the &s;everal new Offices, when they $re bound to erect for the managing the $dditional Parts of the Cu&s;toms, a $word$ $hat the old Building, though very $word$ is too little, and as the late Fire $urnt or demoli&s;h'd &s;ome Part of the $e&s;t End of the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e, they $ave had the Opportunity in rebuilding, $ enlarge it very much, by buying in $word$ Ground of &s;ome of the demoli&s;hed $ou&s;es, to add to the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e, $hich is become now a $word$ glorious $ulding</P>
<P>The $eys, or Wharfs, next the $word$ fronting not the Cu&s;tom$ $ou$e $word$ b$t the who&s;e &s;pace from the &s;ower $word$ or Dock, to the Bridge, ought to taken Notice of as a publi$k Building; $word$ are they le&s;s an Ornament to the $y, as they are a Te&s;timony of the $word$ $word$ carried on in it, than the Royal change it$elf.</P>
<P>The Revenue, or Income, brought in the&s;e Wharfs, inclu&s;ive of the $word$ belonging to them, and the $word$ they employ, is &s;aid to amount to $word$ Sum; and, as I am told, $word$ &s;o little as Forty thou&s;and Pounds Annum: And abundance of Porters, Watchmen, Wharfingers, and other Of|ficers, are maintained here by the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Wharfs; in which, one Thing is very remarkable, That here are Por|ters&punc; and poor working Men, who, though them&s;elves not worth, perhaps, twenty Pounds in the World are tru&s;ted with great Quantities ofvalu$ble Goods, &s;ome|times to the Value of &s;everal Thou&s;and Pounds, and yet 'tis very rarely to be heard, that any Lo$s or Embezzlement is made. The Number of the&s;e Keys extending, as above, from the Bridge to the Tower Dock is &s;eventeen.</P>
<P>From the&s;e publick Places, I come next to the Markets, which, in &s;uch a Ma&s;s of Building, and &s;uch a Collection of People&punc; and where &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s is done, mu&s;t be great, and very many. To take a View of them in particular:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Smithfield Market for living Cat|tle, which is, without Que&s;tion, the greate&s;t in the World; no De&s;cription can be given of it, no Calculation of the Numbers of Creatures &s;old there, can be made. This Market is every Monday and Friday.</P>
<P>There is, indeed, a Liberty taken by the Butchers, to go up to I&s;lington, and to Whitechapel, and boy of the Country Drovers, who bring Cattle to Town; but this is called F$re$talling the Market, and is not $span$ by Law.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a great $word$ or ra|ther Fair for Hor&s;es, in $word$ every Friday in the $word$ where very $word$ Numbers of $or$es and tho&s;e of the highe&s;t Price are to be &s;old Weekly</P>
<P>The Fle&s;h Markets are as follow.</P>
<P>Leaden-Hall, Honey-Lane, N$wgat$, Clare, Shadw$$l, $word$ $span$ Spittle-Fields, H$xton $word$ Brook Bloomsbury, Newport, <HI>St.</HI> James's, Hangerford.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> At all the&s;e Markets, there is Part &s;et by for an Herb-Market&punc; &s;o that when I &s;ay $span$ there are Fi&s;h-Markets, and Herb-Markets,

<P>The&s;e Markets are &s;o con&s;iderable in them&s;elves, that they will me$it a longer and more particular De&s;cription, than I have Room for in this Place. I &s;hall, however, briefly mention them again in their Order.</P>
<P>Of the Fourteen Fle&s;h Markets, or Markets for Provi&s;ions, Seven of them are of antient &s;tanding, Time out of Mind: But the other Seven are erected &s;ince the Enlargement of Buildings mentioned a|bove. The old ones are, Leaden-Hall, Honey-Lane, Newgate Market, South|wark, Clare, St. James's, and We&s;tmin&s;ter; and the&s;e are &s;o con&s;iderable, &s;uch Num|bers of Buyers, and &s;uch an infinite Quan|tity of Provi&s;ions of all Sorts, Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, and Fowl, that, e&s;pecially of the Fir&s;t, no City in the World can equal them. 'Tis of the fir&s;t of the&s;e Markets, that a certain Spin&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador &s;aid, There was as much Meat &s;old in it in one Month as would &s;uffice all Spain for a Year.</P>
<P>This great Market, called, Leaden hall though &s;tanding in the Middle of the City contains Three large Squares, every Squa$ having &s;everal Outlets into divers Street and all into one another. The Fir&s;t, an$ Chief, is called, The Beef Market, whic$ has Two large Gates, one into Lea$$ Hall Street, one into Gracehurch $word$ and Two &s;maller, viz. One by a $word$ pav'd Pa&s;&s;age leading into Lime&s;treet, $word$ one under a Gateway from the Seco$ Square. In this Square, every Wedn$ day is kept a Market for raw Hides, $word$ Leather, and Shoemakers Tools; $word$ in the Warehou&s;es, up Stairs on the $word$ and South Sides of the Square, is the $word$ Market for Coleche&s;ter Bayes.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Square is divided into $word$ Oblongs, in the fir&s;t is the Fi&s;h $word$ and in the other, a Market for $word$ Higlers, who bring &s;mall Things, $word$ Pork, Butter, Eggs, Pigs, Country $word$ with &s;ome Fowls, and &s;uch like $word$ Fare.</P>
<P>The North Part of the Fi&s;h Market&punc; Place being too large for the Fi&s;hmo$ U&s;e, are the Stalls of the Town $word$ for Mutton and Veal the be&s;t and $word$ of which, that England can produce, $word$ be bought there, and the Ea&s;t Pa$$ Fle&s;h Market for Country Butchers.</P>
<P><PB REF="227">
The third, and la&s;t Square, which is al&s;o very large, is divided into three Parts: Round the Circumference, is the Butter-Market, with all the &s;orts of the Higglary Goods, as before: The South Part is the Poulty-Market, and the Ba|con-Market, and the Center is an Herb-Market.</P>
<P>All the other Markets follow the &s;ame Method in Proportion to the Room they have for it; and there is an Herb Market in every one; but the chief Markets in the whole City for Herbs and Garden|&s;tuff, are the Stocks and Covent Garden.</P>
<P>There are but two Corn Markets in the whole City and Out Parts; but they are Mon&s;ters for Magnitude, and not to be matched in the World The&s;e are Bear Key, and Queen Hith: To the fir&s;t comes all the va&s;t Quantity of Corn that is brought into the City by Sea, and here Corn may be &s;aid, not to be &s;old by Cart Loads, or Hor&s;e Loads, but by Ship Loads, and, except the Corn Chambers and Magazines in Holland, when the Fleets come in from Dantzick and England, the whole World cannot equal the Quantity bought and &s;old here.</P>
<P>This is the Place whither all the Corn is brought, which, as I have ob&s;erved, is provided in all the Counties of England, near the Sea Coa&s;t, and &s;hipp'd for Lon|don, and no Quantity can be wanted, ei|ther for home Con&s;umption, or for Foreign Exportation, but the Corn Factors, who are the Managers of this Market, are rea|dy to &s;upply it.</P>
<P>The other, which I call a Corn Mar|ket too, is at Queen Hith; but this Mar|ket is chiefly, if not wholly, &s;o. Malt; as to the whole Corn, as the Quantity of Malt brought to this Market is prodigious great, &s;o I mu&s;t ob&s;erve too, that this Place is the Receiver of all the Malt, the Barley of which, takes up the Ground of &s;o many hundred thou&s;and Acres of Land in the Counties of Surrey, Bucks, Berks, Oxford, Southampton, and Wilts, and is called We&s;t Country Malt.</P>
<P>It is true, there is a very great Quan|tity of Malt, and of other Corn too, brought to &s;ome other Places on the Ri|ver, and &s;old there, viz. To Milford Lane, above the Bridge, and the Hermi|tage, below the Bridge; but this is but, in general, a Branch of the Trade of the other Places.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be omitted, that Queen Hith is al&s;o a very great Market for Meal, as well as Malt, and, perhaps, the greate&s;t in England.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;els which bring this Malt and Meal to Queen Hith, are worth the Ob|&s;ervation of any Stranger that under&s;tands &s;uch Things They are remarkable for the Length of the Ve&s;&s;el&punc; and the Burthen they carry, and yet the little Water they draw; in a Word, &s;ome of tho&s;e Barges carry above a thou&s;and Quarter of Malt at Time, and yet do not draw two Foot of Watter. N. B. A Thou&s;and Quarter of Malt mu&s;t be granted to be, at lea&s;t, a hundred Tun Burthen. Note al&s;o, Some of the&s;e large Barges come as far as from Abbington, which is above one hundred and Fifty miles from London, if we mea|&s;ure by the River.</P>
<P>The next Market, which is more than ordinary remarkable, is the Coal Market at Billing&s;gate. This is kept every Morn|ing on the broad Place ju&s;t at the Head of Billing&s;gate Dock, and the Place is cal|led Room Land; from what old forgot|ten Original it has that Name, Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent. I need not, except for the &s;ake of Strangers, take Notice, that the City of London, and Parts adjacent, as al&s;o all the South of England, is &s;upplied with Coals, called therefore Sea-coal, from New|ca&s;tle upon Tine, and from the Coa&s;t of Durham, and Northumberland. This Trade is &s;o con&s;iderable, that it is e&s;teemed the great Nur&s;ery of our be&s;t Seamen, and of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay more in my Account of the Northern Parts of England. The Quantity of Coals, which it is &s;uppo&s;ed are, Communibus Annis, burnt and con&s;umed in and about this Ci|ty, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about Five hundred thou&s;and Chalder, every Chalder contain|ing thirty &s;ix Bu&s;hels, and generally weigh|ing about thirty hundred Weight.</P>
<P><PB REF="228">
All the&s;e Coals are bought and &s;old on this little of Room Land, and though &s;ometimes, e&s;pecially in ca&s;e of War, or of contrary Winds, a Fleet of five hun|dred to &s;even hundred &s;ail of &s;hips, comes up the River at a Time, yet they ne|ver want a market: The Brokers, or Buy|ers of the&s;e Coals, are called Crimps, for what Rea&s;on, or Original, is likewi&s;e a my&s;tery peculiar to this Trade; for the&s;e People are noted for giving &s;uch d$$k Names to the &s;everal Pares of their Trade; &s;o the Ve&s;&s;els they load their &s;hips with at Newca&s;tle, are called Keels, and the Ships that bring them, are called Cats, and Hags, or Hag Boats, and the like. But of that hereafter.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of this Con&s;umption of Coals is another Evidence of the great increa&s;e of the City of London; for, within a few Years pa&s;t, the import of Coals was not, in the River of Thames, &s;o great by very near half.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that as the City of London occa&s;ions the Con&s;umption of &s;o great a Quantity of Corn and Coals, &s;o the Mea&s;urement of them is under the In&s;pection of the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, and for the Ditection of which, there are allowed a certain Number of Corn&punc;Meeters, and bring them in a very con&s;iderable in|come. The&s;e Places are in the Gift of the Lord Mayor for the Time being, and are generally &s;old for three o$ $our thou&s;and Pounds a Peice, when they fall.</P>
<P>They have abundance of poor men em|ploy'd under them, who are called, al&s;o, Meeters, and are, or ought to be, Free|men of the City.</P>
<P>This is, indeed, a Rent-charge upon the Buyer, and is a kind of Gabel, as well upon the Coals as the Corn; but the Buyer is abundantly recompen&s;ed, by being a&s;certain'd in his mea&s;ure with|out any Fraud; &s;o that having bought his Coals or Corn, he is perfectly un|concerned about the mea&s;ure, for the &s;worn Meeters are &s;o placed between the buyer and &s;eller, that no injury can be offered, nor have I heard that any com|plaint of inju&s;tice is ever made again&s;t the Meeters, who are generally men of good character, are &s;worn to do Right, and cannot ea&s;ily do Wrong without be|ing detected; &s;o many $word$ $word$ about them, and &s;o many &s;everal Per&s;ons con|cerned in the Work, who have no Depen|dance one upon another.</P>
<P>There is one great Work yet behind&punc; which, however, &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to a full De&s;cription of the City of London, and that is the Shipping and the Pool; but in what manner can any Writer go about it, to bring it into any rea&s;onable compa&s;s? The Thing is a kind of Infi|nite, and the Parts to be &s;eparated from one another in &s;uch a De&s;cription, are &s;o many, that it is hard to know where to begin.</P>
<P>The whole River, in a Word, from London-Bridge&punc; to Black Wall, is one great Ar&s;enal, nothing in the World can be like it. The great Building-Yards at Schedam near Am&s;terdam, are &s;aid to out&punc;do them in the Number of Ships which are built there, and they tell us, that there me more Ships generally &s;een at Am&s;terdam&punc; than in the Thames.</P>
<P>As to the Bu lding Part&punc; I will not &s;ay, but that there may be more Ve&s;&s;els built at Schedam, and the Parts adjacent, than in the River Thames; but then it mu&s;t be &s;aid:</P>
<P N="1">1 That the Engli&s;h build for them|&s;elves only, the Dutch for all the World.</P>
<P N="2">2. That almo&s;t all the Ships the Dutch have&punc; are built there, whereas, $span$ $word$ Part of our &s;hipping $span$ i$ the Thames; but abundance of Ship are built at all the Sea Ports in Eng|land&punc; $$ch as at Newca&s;tle, Sunder|land, $word$, Whitby, Hull, Gainsbo|rough&punc; $word$ Lynn, Yarmouth, Al|borough, $word$ Ip&s;wich and Har|wich, upon the Ea&s;t Coa&s;t; and at Sho|ram&punc; Arund$$&punc; Brighthelm&s;ton, Port&s;mouth, Southampton&punc; Pool, Weymouth, Dart|mouth, Plymouth, be&s;ides other Places, on the South coa&s;t.</P>
<P N="3"><PB REF="229">
3. That we &s;ee more Ve&s;&s;els in le&s;s Room at Am&s;terdam; but the &s;etting a&s;ide their Hoys, Bilanders and Schoots, which are in great Numbers always there, being Ve&s;&s;els particular to their Inland and Coa&s;ting Navigation; you do not &s;ee more Ships, nor near &s;o many Ships of Force, at Am&s;terdam as at London.</P>
<P N="4">4. That you &s;ee more Ships there in in le&s;s Room, but, perhaps, not &s;o many Ships in the whole.</P>
<P>That Part of the River of Thames which is properly the Harbour, and where the Ships u&s;ually deliver or unload their Cargoes, is called the Pool, and begins at the turning of the River out of Limehou&s;e-Reach, and extends to the Cu&s;tom&punc;hou&s;e Keys: In this Compa&s;s I have had the Curio&s;ity to count the Ships as well as I could, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> and have found above two thou&s;and &s;ail of all &s;orts, not reckoning Barges, Lighters or Plea&s;ure Boats, and Yatchs; but of Ve&s;&s;els that really go to Sea.</P>
<P>It is true, the River or Pool, &s;eem'd, at that time, to be pretty full of &s;hips; it is true al&s;o, that I $word$ the &s;hips which lay in Deptford and Black Wall Reaches, and in the Wet Docks, where|of, there are no le&s;s than three; but '$is as true&punc; that we did not include the Men of War at the King's Yard, and in the Wet Dock there at Deptford, which were not a very few.</P>
<P>In the River, as I have ob&s;erved, there are from Battle Bridge on the South|wark &s;ide, and the Hermitag-Bridge on the City &s;ide, reckoning to Black-Wall, inclu&s;ive,

<P>This is inclu&s;ive of the Builders of Lighters, &amp;c. but exclu&s;ive of Boat Build|ers, Wherry-Builders, and above Bridge Barge-Builders.</P>
<P>To enter into any De&s;cription of the great Magazines of all manner of Naval Stores, for the furni&s;hing tho&s;e Buildings, would be endle&s;s, and I &s;hall not attempt it; 'tis &s;ufficient to add&punc; That England, as I have &s;aid el&s;ewhere, is an inex|hau&s;tible Store-hou&s;e of Timber, and all the Oak Timber, and generally the Plank al&s;o, u&s;ed in the building the&s;e &s;hips, is found in England only, nay, and which is more, it is not fetched from the remoter Parts of England, but the&s;e Southern Counties near us are the Places where 'tis generally found; as particularly the Counties of Berks and B$cks, Surrey, Kent, Sussex, E&s;&s;ex and Su$$olk, and very little is brought far|ther&punc; nor can al$ the &s;hip building the whole Kingdom are able to build&punc; ever exhau&s;t tho&s;e Counties, tho' they were to build much mor than they do.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t land, le&s;t this Part of the Account &s;eems to &s;mell of the Tar, and I &s;hould tire the Gentlemen with leading them out of their Knowledge.</P>
<P>I &s;hould men$o$, for the information of &s;trangers, &amp;c. that the Buildings of this great City are chiefly of Brick, as many ways found to be the &s;afe&s;t, the cheape&s;t, and the mo&s;t commodious of all other Materials; by &s;afe; I mean from Fire, and as by Act of Parliament, every Builder is bound to have a Parthian W$ll of Back al&s;o, one Brick and Hall thick between every Hou&s;e, it is found to be, indeed, very helpful in ca&s;e of Fire.</P>
<P>And as I am &s;peaking of Fire and burning of Hou&s;es, it cannot be omitted&punc; That no where in the World is &s;o good Care taken to quench Fires as in Lon|don; I will not &s;ay the like Care is taken to prevent them; for I may &s;ay That I think the Servants, nay, and Ma&s;ters too in London, are the mo&s;t carele&s;s People in the World about Fire and this, no doubt, is the Rea&s;on why there are frequently more Fires in Lon|don and in the Out parts, than there ar$ in all the Cities of Europe put them to|gether; nor are they the more careful as I can learn, either from Ob&s;ervation
<PB REF="230">
or Report, I &s;ay, they are not made more cautious, by the innumerable Fires which continually happen among them.</P>
<P>And this leads me back to what I ju&s;t now &s;aid, That no City in the World is &s;o well furni&s;hed for the extingui&s;hing Fires when they happen.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the great Convenience of Wa|ter which being every where laid in the Streets in large Timber Pipes, as well from the Thames as the New-River, tho&s;e Pipes are furni&s;hed with a Fire Plug, which the Pari&s;h Officers have the Key of and when opened, let out not a Pipe, but a River of Water into the Streets, &s;o that making but a Dam in the Kennel, the whole Street is immediately under Water to &s;upply the Engines.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the graat Number of admirable Engines, of which, almo&s;t, every Pari&s;h has One, and &s;ome Halls al&s;o, and &s;ome private Citizens have them of their own, &s;o that no &s;ooner does a Fire break out, but the Hou&s;e is &s;urrounded with Engines, and a Flood of Water poured upon it, 'till the Fire is, as it were, not extingui&s;hed only, but drowned.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;everal En&s;urance Offices, of which I have &s;poken above, have each of them a certain Sett of Men, who they keep in con&s;tant Pay, and who they fur|ni&s;h with Tools proper for the Work, and and to whom they give Jack-Caps of Lea|ther, able to keep them from Hurt, if Brick or Timber, or any thing not of too great a Bulk, &s;hould fall upon them; the&s;e Men make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to be ready at Call, all Hours, and Night or Day, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in ca&s;e of Fire; and it mu&s;t be acknowledg|ed&punc; they are very dextrous, bold, diligent and &s;ucce&s;sful. The&s;e they call Fire-men, but with an odd kind of Contradiction in the Title, for they are really mo&s;t of them Water-men.</P>
<P>Having mentioned, that the City is &s;o well furni&s;hed with Water, it cannot be omitted, that there are Two great Engines for the rai&s;ing for Water, one at the Bridge, and the other near Brok|en Wharf; the&s;e rai&s;e &s;o great a Quan|tity of Water, that, as they tell us, they are able to &s;upply the whole City $ its utmo&s;t Extent, and to &s;upply eve$ Hou&s;e al&s;o, with a running Pipe of W$|ter up to the uppermo&s;t Story.</P>
<P>However, the New-River, which i brought by an Aqueduct or artificial S$$ea$ from Ware, continnes to &s;upply the great|er Part of the City with Water, only with this Addition by the way, that they have been obliged to dig a new Head $ Ba&s;in at Iflington on a higher Ground the$ that which the natural Stream of the Ri|ver &s;upplies, and this higher Ba&s;in the$ fill from the lower, by a great Engi$ worked formerly with Six Sails, now b$ many Hor&s;es con&s;tantly working; &s;o fro$ that new Elevation of the Water, the$ &s;upply the higher Part of the Town wa$ the &s;ame Advantage, and more Ea&s;e th$$ the Thames Engines do it.</P>
<P>There was a very likely Propo&s;al $word$ on Foot by &s;ome Gentlemen, who&s;e G$|nius &s;eem'd equal to the Work, for dra$|ing another River, rather larger than th$ now running, and bringing it to a He$ on &s;ome ri&s;ing Grounds beyond Mary Bonne.</P>
<P>This Water was propo&s;ed to be broug$$ from the little Coln or Cole near St. $|bans, and the River, called Two Wate$ near Rickman&s;worth, and as I have $word$ the Cour&s;e of the Water, and the &s;ever Supplies it was to have, and how the W$|ter-level was drawn for containing $word$ Current, I mu&s;t acknowledge it was very Practical Undertaking, and men$ Encouragement; but it was oppole$ Parliament, and dropt for the pre&s;e$$ This De&s;ign was particularly calculat$ for &s;upplying tho&s;e prodigious Additi$$ of Buildings, which I have already &s;crib'd at the We&s;t End of the Town.</P>
<P>However, tho' this be laid a&s;ide, al&s;o &s;everal Water-hou&s;es in other $word$ particularly one at Wapping, one $word$ Battle-Bridge in Southwark, and the $word$ one at York-Buildings, yet it $word$ not be denied, that the City of Lon$$$ is the be&s;t &s;upplied with Water of $word$ great City in the World, and upon as $word$ Terms to its Inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB REF="231">
There were formerly &s;everal beautiful Conduits of Running-Watter in London, which Water was very &s;weet and good, and was brought at an infinite Expence. from &s;everal di&s;tant Springs, in large lead|en Pipes to tho&s;e Conduits, and this was &s;o lately, that &s;everal of tho&s;e Conduits were re built &s;ince the Fire, as one on Snow-Hill and one at Stocks-Market, which &s;erves as a Pede&s;tal for the great Eque&s;trian Statue of King Charles the II. erected there at the Charge of Sir Robert Viner, then Lord Mayor, and who was then an eminent Banker in Lombard &s;treet; but his Loyalty could not pre&s;erve him from being ruined by the common Calami|ty, when the King &s;hut up the Exchequer.</P>
<P>They tell us a merry Story of this Sta|tue, how true it may be, let tho&s;e te&s;tify who &s;aw it, if any &s;uch Witne&s;&s;es remain, viz That a certain famous Court Lady, I do not &s;ay it was the D&mdash;&s;s of Port&s;|mouth, being brought to Bed of a Son late in the Night, the next Morning this glorious Eque&s;trian Statue had a Pillion hand&s;omely placed on it behind the Body of the K&mdash;, with a Paper pinned to the Trapping of the Pillion, with Words at length, Gone for a Midwife</P>
<P>It is &s;carce worth while to give an Ac|count of the Statues in this City, they are neither many, or are tho&s;e which are, very valuable.</P>
<P>The Statue of King Charles II. in Mar|ble, &s;tanding in the middle of the Royal Exchange, is the be&s;t beyond Compari&s;on; one of the &s;ame Prince, and his Father, &s;tanding in Two large Niches on the South Front of the &s;ame Building, and being big|ger than the Life, are coar&s;e Pieces com|pared to it.</P>
<P>The Sta$ues of the Kings and Queens, Seventeen of which are already put up in the In&s;ide of the Royal Exchange, are to|lerable, but all infinitely inferior to that in the middle.</P>
<P>There is a Statue of Sir Thomas Gre|&s;ham, the Founder of the Royal Exchange, which outdoes many of tho&s;e Kings, only that it &s;tands in a dark Corner, and is lit|tle noticed; 'tis placed in a Nitch under the Piazza, in the North We&s;t Angle $ the Exchenge, ju&s;t regarding the Turk Walk, and he has a Bale of Silk lying b$ him.</P>
<P>There is another Eque&s;trian Statue, an$ but One, as I remember, within the City and that is of King James the Fir&s;t on th$ North Front of one of the Gates of th$ City called Alder&s;gate: This was erected on the Occa&s;ion of that King's entring the City at that Gate when he arrived here from Scotland, to take the Crown after the Death of Queen Elizabeth; when that Statue was finely painted and Gilded, which is not u&s;ual, nor is the Gilding yet worn off; there are &s;ome emblematick Figures remaining, which were then &s;uited to the Occa&s;ion of his triumphal Entry, and there was another Arch form'd for the Day at the Bars, where the Liberties of the City end&punc; t$at way which is now called Go&s;well-&s;treet, but that was taken down &s;oon after.</P>
<P>The Gates of the City are Seven, be|&s;ides Po&s;terns, and the $o&s;te$ns that re|main are Four, be&s;ides others that are demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Gates are all remaining. Two of them which were demoli&s;hed at the Fire, being beautifully Re-built: The&s;e are Lud|gate and Newgate; the Fir&s;t a Pri&s;on for Debt for Freemen of the City only, the other a Pri&s;on for Criminals, both for London and Middle&s;ex, and for Debtors al&s;o for Middle&s;ex, being the County Goal.</P>
<P>Moregate is al&s;o Re-built, and is a very beautiful Gateway, the Arch being near Twenty Foot high, which was done to give Room for the City Train'd Bands to go through to the Artillery Ground, where they Mu&s;ter, and that they might march with their Pikes advanc'd, for then they had Pikemen in every Regiment, as well in the Army as in the Militia, which &s;ince that, is quite left off; this makes the Gate look a little out of Shape, the Oc|ca&s;ion of it not being known. Cripple|gate and Bi&s;hop$gate are very Old, and make but a mean Figure: Alder&s;gate is a|bout One hundred and Twenty Years old,
<PB REF="232">
and yet being Beautified, as I &s;aid, on the Occa&s;ion of King James's Entry, looks very hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>Aldgate was very ancient and decay'd, &s;o that <HI>as Old as Aldgate,</HI> was a City-Proverb for many Years; but this Gate was Re-built al&s;o, upon the Triumphant Entry of K. James I. and look$ &s;till very well; on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of this Gate are two &s;tatues in &s;tone, repre&s;enting two Men, from the wa&s;te upward, and in Armour, throwing down two great &s;tones, &s;uppo|&s;ing it to be on an Enemy a&s;&s;aulting the G $word$ which I mention, becau&s;e &s;ome ti$$ ago, one of the&s;e Men in Armour, whether tired with holding it &s;o long, or dreaming of Enemies a&s;&s;aulting the Gate, our Authors do not inform us; but he threw down the &s;tone, or rathet let it fall, after having held it upwards of an hun|dred Years; but, as it happened, it did no harm.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e Gates are given by the City to the chief of the Officers of the City to live in, and the Hou&s;es are very convenient Dwellings.</P>
<P>Temple Bar is the only Gate which is erected at the Extent of the City Li|berties, and this was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome needful Ceremonies at the Proclaming any King or Queen of England, at which Time the Gates are &s;hut; the Herald at Arms knocks hard at the Door, the Sheriffs of the City call bac, k asking who is there? Then the Herald an&s;wers, <HI>I come to Proclaim,</HI> &amp;c. according to the Name of the Prince who is to &s;uc|ceed to the Crown, repeating the Titles of Great Britain, France and Ireland, &amp;c. at which the Sheriffs open, and bid them Welcome, and &s;o they go on to the Ex|change, where they make the la&s;t Procla|mation.</P>
<P>This Gate is adorned with the Figures of Kings below, and Traytors above, the Heads of &s;everal Criminals executed for Trea&s;on being &s;et up there; the Sta|tues below are of Queen Elizabeth and King James I. King Charles I. and II. and this is the fourth &s;tatue of K. Charles II. which is to be &s;een in the City of Lon|don, be&s;ides his Picture nobly done at full Length, which was &s;et up formerly in the Guild-Hall.</P>
<P>There are in London, and the far ex|tended Bounds, which I now call &s;o, not|with&s;tanding we are a Nation of Liberty, more publick and private Pri&s;ons, and Hou&s;es of Confinement, than any Cry in Europe, perhaps as many as in all the Capital Cities of Europe put together for Example:</P>

<P>That every Front &s;hould contain 400 Yards, or 1200 Feet, in length; that there &s;hou'd be four Areas or Squares in the In&s;ide of the Building, the Fir&s;t from the North Entrance to be Oblong, taking up the whole Length of the Building from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and that then a long Build|ing &s;hould cro&s;s the whole Work, Eighty Feet broad, and from the Ea&s;t Range One thou&s;and Feet broad to the We&s;t; and in the middle of which, &s;hould be a great Arch or Gate looking to the South Gate of the Palace: That the other Side of the Palace be divided into Three Squares, having Two Ranges of Build|ings to run cro&s;s them from South to North, and each Range to joyn the great Range of Building which runs from Ea&s;t to We&s;t.</P>
<P>That the whole Building be withdrawn from the River &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as where the Statue of King James II. now &s;tands, and a &s;pacious Terras to be carried on in|to the Thames Twelve Feet beyond Low Water-Mark, and over the River a hand|&s;ome Foot bridge of Twelve great Arches only, with a Cau&s;eway at the End over St. George's Fields; that the Te$ras $word$ Space between the Palace and the Wate$&punc; be made into a fine Garden, with an Oran|gery on the North&punc;&s;ide, reaching to the Edge of the Terras &s;o effectually, as it may cover the Garden from the View of any of the Buildings on the Strand|&s;ide, and a Royal Bagn$o at the other End likewi&s;e, to cover the nece&s;&s;ary Building$ for the Kitchins which are behind it.</P>
<P>For the Extent North, 'tis propo&s;ed&punc; That all the Buildings be taken down to the Wall of Northumberland Hou&s;e, on that Side; and to the North &s;ide of the Spring Garden, oppo&s;ite to Suffolk-&s;t$ee$ and the Hay Market on the other Side
<PB REF="235">
&s;o the Front of the Building that Way, will extend from the hither part of Scot|land yard gate, to Prince Rupert's Garden, and the Gate of the Palace being in the Center of the Building, will open in that which is now called the Sping Garden.</P>
<P>One Gate of the Palace opening thus North, a Ballu&s;trade of Iron, like that which &s;urrounds St. Paul's Church, &s;hould take in a large Parade, reaching to the Meu&s;e-Gate, a Space for the Street only excepted, and in proportion tho other way towards Pall-Mall; and here on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, and on the We&s;t-&s;ide, Two large Guard-hou&s;es &s;hould be erected, fitted, the one for the Hor&s;e Guards, and the other for the Foot, both within the Ballu&s;trade, but without the Palace, and Two &s;maller Guard-hou&s;es for Detachments of both, be likewi&s;e placed on the South-&s;ide, all at a proper Di&s;tance from the main Build|ing, and all low built.</P>
<P>The Canal in the Park would be nece&s;|&s;arily filled up for about a hundred Yards, for the Extent of the Building that Way; the Street that now is, mu&s;t, at the &s;ame Time, be turned, and a large Street for Communication with We&s;tmin&s;ter, be al|lowed to cro&s;s the Park from the Pall-Mall South, towards We&s;tmin&s;ter, to come out at the New Iron Gate, now leading to Queen's &s;quare and Tottil-&s;treet; but no Hou&s;es to be built in it, and Four Gates in the &s;aid Street, to lead over the Street, from the Fir&s;t Floor of the Palace, by Galleries into the Park; All Buildings ad|j$ining to the Park to be taken down, nor any private Doors or Keys to be al|lowed; a Stone Wall of twenty Feet high and eight Feet thick, to be built round the Park, and the Park to be extended We&s;t, by taking in Buckingham Hou&s;e, with its Gardens.</P>
<P>In this Building, the Propo&s;er's Scheme was To have all the Offices of the King's Exchequer, the Revenue, the Council, the Secretaries of State, the Admiralty, the Courts of Ju&s;tice, and both Hou&s;es of Parliament, contain'd within the Palace, as was the U&s;age in former Times.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, the cro&s;s Range o$ Buildings, going from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, througl the Center of the Palace, and looking in to the great oblong Court, which would contain a thou&s;and Feet, exclu&s;ive of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Fronts, and of the great Arch or Gate in the Center, &s;hould be di|vided thus; That Part on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Gate to contain Two &s;pacious Rooms, one for the Hou&s;e of Peers, the other for the Hou&s;e of Commons, with &s;ufficient Offices, Galleries of Communication, Rooms of Conference for Committees, a Court of Reque&s;ts, &amp;c. for the U&s;e of the Mem|bers, and Rooms for all other Occa&s;ion, of Parliament Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The We&s;t Part of this great Range of Building to contain a Hall, as We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Hall now is, with proper &s;eparated Courts for the King's Bench, Chancery, Common Pleas, and Exchequer-Bars, and a di&s;tinct Court fix'd, and &s;uitably pre|pared, for the Tryals of Peers or others, by the Hou&s;e of Lords, notwith&s;tanding which, this Court would be &s;ufficiently large to celebrate the Coronation Fea&s;t, with all its Ceremonies, the Building be|ing from the middle Arch to the We&s;t Range of the Buildings, five hundred Feet long at lea&s;t, and one hundred Feet broad.</P>
<P>Thus the King's Court of Ju&s;tice, his High Court of Parliament, and all the Affairs of the Admini&s;tration, would be managed within his own Hou&s;e, as it anci|ently was; and as the two cro&s;s Ranges of Buildings, which form'd the three Courts on the South-&s;ide of the Parliament Hou&s;e and Hall of Ju&s;tice, would be very large, they would afford Room for the Lord Chamberlain's Office, the Admiralty, the War Office, the Green-Cloth, the Ward|robe Office, and all the other Family Of|fices, too many to name here.</P>
<P>Then the main Range of Building on the North-&s;ide of the Palace, &s;hould con|tain (becau&s;e neare&s;t the City) the Trea|&s;ury Office, the Secretary's Offices, the Council Chambers, and the Exchequer Offices.</P>

<P>The Stair ca&s;es to land upon the Gal|leries, before they enter the Apartments, and for that Rea&s;on, to be in the In&s;ide of the Building, and to be di&s;tinct from it, to prevent taking up any of the Apart|ments of the Angles, which are appoint|ed for other Purpo&s;es; in the Middle of the King's great Gallery, Doors &s;hould be made, leading into the great middle Range of Buildings; by one of which, His Ma|je&s;ty may enter a Gallery leading to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and by the other, enter thro' another Gallery to the Chapel Roy|al: In the great Gallery and in the Hall, Sixteen large Bou$$etts or Cupboards of Gold and gilt Plate of all kinds, to be &s;et open on publick Days.</P>

<P>This, indeed, is but an $mb$yo; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, it would be a magni|ficent Building, and would very well &s;uit the Grandeur of the Briti&s;h Court Here a King of Great Britain wo$$d live l ke him&s;elf, and half the World would $un over to &s;ee and wonder at it.</P>
<P>This whole Building, the Per&s;on $word$ it, offered to fini&s;h, tha$ $word$ &s;ay, all the Out &s;ide W$$$&punc; $word$ Bricklayers Work, with $word$ $word$ Plumbers, Carpenters and loy $word$ Work, Carvers, Stone $span$ Work, Iron work and I $span$ Ballu&s;trade and fine $$ates, and, $word$ $word$ the whole Palace, except $word$ $word$ Gardening and&punc; Waterwork for $word$ Millions three hundred thou&s;and Pound the King giving $im$er $word$ the Under taker to cut it down, and b ing it to $word$ Place, the King giving the Po tland $word$ al&s;o, and bringing it by Water to $word$ Place.</P>

<P>But I return to the De&s;cription of Thin$$ which really exi&s;t, and are not imaginary As the Court is now &s;tated, all the Offi$$ and Places for Bu&s;ine&s;s are &s;catter'd $|bout.</P>
<P>The Parliament meets, as they $word$ did, while the Court was at westminster in the King's Old Palace, and there $word$ the Courts of Ju&s;tice al&s;o, and the Of|ficers of the Exchequer, nor can it be $word$ however convenient the Place is $word$ for them; but that it has a little $word$ Air of venerable, tho' ruin'd $word$ What is the Court of Reque&s;ts, the $word$ of Wards, and the Painted Chamber, th$$ lately repair'd, but the Corps of the $word$ Engli&s;h Grandeur laid in State?</P>
<P>The whole, it is true, was anciently the King's Palace or Royal Hou&s;e, and $word$ up full as much Ground as the $word$ Palace, which I have given a $ch$me $word$ would do, except only the Gardens an$ the Space before it, which is $word$ called Palace yard, is much greater tha$ that which would be at the North Gat$$
<PB REF="239">
of the Palace of White-hall, as propo&s;ed. The Gardens, indeed, were not large but not de&s;picab$e neither, being the &s;ame where my Lord Hall$fax's Hou&s;e and Gardens now are, and too up all the Ground which we &s;ee now built upon be|tw en the River and the Old Palace, where the Tellers of the Exchequer, as wel as the Audi$or, have hand&s;ome Dwel|lings and Gardens al&s;o.</P>
<P>But, alas! as I &s;ay, tho' they &s;eem now even in their Ruins, great; yet com+pared to the Beauty an$ Elegancy of Mo|dern Living, and of Royal Buildings in this Age, what are they!</P>
<P>The Royal Apartments, the Prince's Lodgings, the great Officers Apa tments, what are they now, but little Offices for Clerks, Rooms for Coffee-hou&s;es, Aucti|ons of Pictures, Pamphlet and Toy|&s;hops?</P>
<P>Even St. Stephen's Chapel, formerly the Royal Chapel of the Palace, but $word$ lately beautifyed for the $$nvenience of the Hou&s;e of Commons, was a very in|different Place, old and decayed: The Hou&s;e of Lords is a venerable old Place, indeed; but how mean, how incoherent&punc; and how &s;traitned are the &s;everal Avenues to it, and Rooms about it? the Matted Gallery, the Lobby, the back Way the King goes to it, how &s;hort are they all of the Dignity of the Place, and the Glory of a King of Great Britain, with the Lords and Commons, that &s;o often meet there?</P>
<P>Some Attempts were made lately, to have re&s;tored the decrepid Circum&s;tances of this Part of the Building, and O ders were given to Mr Ben&s;on, then Surveyor of the King's Buildings, to do his Part to|wards it; but it was directed &s;o ill, or un|der&s;tood &s;o little, that &s;ome thought he was more likely to throw the old Fabrick down, than to &s;et it to Rights, for which Ignorance and V$$i$y, 'tis &s;aid, &s;ome have not fared as they de&s;erved</P>
<P>It is true, the Sitting of the Parliament is by the Order of the Hou&s;es them&s;elve$, accommodated as well as the Place will admit; but how much more Beautiful it would be in &s;uch a Building&punc; as is above contrived, I leave to the Contriver to de|&s;cribe, and to other People to judge.</P>
<P>Come we next to We&s;tmin&s;ter hall; 'tis true, it is a very noble G$th$ck Building, Ancient, va&s;tly large, and the fine&s;t Roof of its kind in England, being one hundred Feet wide; but what a wretc$ed Figure does it make without Doors; the Front, a va&s;t P$$acle o$ Pede$ent, after the mo&s;t Ancient, and almo&s;t forgotten Pa$t of the G$$hick Way of Working; the Building it&s;elf, re em$les nothing &s;o much as a great Barn of Three hundred Feet long and real y $word$ like a Barn at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Nay&punc; if we view the whole Building from w thout Doors, $word$ like a great Pile of &s;omething, but a Stranger would be much a$ a $word$ to know what; and whe|ther $word$ is a Hou&s;e or a Church, or, in|deed, a $word$ of Churches; being hud|dled all together, with diffe ing and di&s;tant Roofs, come higher, &s;ome lower, &s;ome &s;tanding $a&s;t and We&s;t, &s;ome North and South, and &s;ome one Way, and &s;ome another.</P>
<P>The Abbey, or Collegiate Church of We&s;tmin&s;ter, &s;tands next to this; a vene|rable old Pile of building, it is indeed, but &s;o old and weak, that had it not been taken in Hand &s;ome Years ago, and great Co&s;t be&s;towed in upholding and repairing it we might, by this Time have $alled it a Heap, not a P le&punc; and not a Church, but the Ruins of a Church.</P>
<P>But it begins to &s;t$nd upon new Legs now and as they continue to Work upon the Repairs of i$ the Face of the whole Building will, in a &s;hort while, be intirely New.</P>
<P>This is the Repo&s;itory of the Briti&s;h Kings and Nobility, and very fine Monu|ments are here $een over the G$a$es of our Ancient Monarchs; the Particulars are too long to enter into here, and are &s;o many Times de&s;cribed by &s;everal Authors, that it woul be a vain Repetition to en|ter upon it here; be&s;ides, we have by no means any Room for it.</P>
<P>The Monarchs of Great Britain are al|ways Crown'd here, even King James II.
<PB REF="240">
&s;ubmitted to it, and to have it perform'd by a Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hop. It is ob&s;ervable, that our Kings and Queens make always Two Solemn Vi&s;its to this Church, and very rarely if ever, come here any more, viz. to be Crown'd and to be Buried.</P>
<P>Two Things I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, and with that I clo&s;e the Account of it. 1. 'Tis very Remarkable, that the Royal Vault, in which the Engli&s;h Royal Fa|mily was laid, was filled up with Queen Ann; &s;o that ju&s;t as the Family was ex|tinct above, there was no Room to have buried any more below. 2. It is become &s;uch a Piece of Honour to be buried in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, that the Body of the Church begins to be crowded with the Bodies of Citizens, Poets&punc; Seamen and Par&s;ons, nay even with very mean Per&s;ons, if they have but any way made them&s;elves known in the World; &s;o that in Time, the Royal A&s;hes will be thus mingled with common Du&s;t, that it will leave no Room either for King or com|mon People, or at lea&s;t not for their Monuments, &s;ome of which al&s;o are ra|ther pompou&s;ly Fooli&s;h, than Solid and to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Near to this Church is the Royal Free-School, the be&s;t of its kind in Eng|land, not outdone either by Winche&s;ter or Eaton, for a Number of eminent Scholars.</P>
<P>The Aniquities of this Church, for it is very Ancient, are publi&s;hed by two or three &s;everal Authors; but are parti|cularly to be &s;eeu in <HI>Dugdale</HI>'s <HI>Mona|&s;$icon.</HI> The Revenues of it were very great, and the Abbot &s;at as a Spi|ritual Peer in the Hou&s;e of Lords. The Revenues are &s;till very large, and the Dean is generally Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter; the Fate of the late Bi&s;hop I de&s;ire to bury with him, who is gone to Oblivion. The Dean and Chapter have &s;till great Privileges as well as Revenues, and par|ticularly the Civil Government, or Tem|poral Juri&s;diction of the City of We&s;t|min&s;ter, is &s;o far in them, that the High-Steward and the High-Bailiff are named by them ab&s;olutely, without any Re|&s;erve either to King or People. Their pre&s;ent High-Steward is the Earl of Arran, Brother to the late Duke of Or|mond, and their High-Bailiff, is William Morris, E&s;q;</P>
<P>Being got into this Part of We&s;tmin|&s;ter, I &s;hall fini&s;h it as I go, that I may not return: 'Tis remarkable, that the whole City, called properly, We&s;tmin|&s;ter, and &s;tanding on the South &s;ide of the Park, is but One Pari&s;h, and is the only City of one Pari&s;h in England. There is now another great Church e|rected, or rather erecting, by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for building fifty new Churches; but they have been &s;trangely mi&s;taken in the &s;ituation, which is a fenny mar&s;hy Ground, and it is not found &s;o able to &s;upport the weight as, perhaps, they were told it would; I &s;ay no more. The Building was very curious, e&s;pe|cially the Roof; but the Towers are not &s;o beautiful as it is thought was intended, the Foundation not being to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Earl of Peterborough's Hou&s;e &s;tands at the Extremity of the Buildings, and is the Point of Mea&s;urement for the Length of London, which from that Hou&s;e to Lime-hou&s;e, is reckoned &s;even Miles and a Quarter, and &s;ome Rods: This Hou&s;e might have been a Moni|tor for the Builders of the New Church, for they tell us it has &s;unk &s;everal Yards, &s;ince it was fir&s;t built, tho' this I do not affirm.</P>
<P>There are three Chapels of Ea&s;e to St. Margaret's in this Part of We&s;tmin|&s;ter, be&s;ides that, great Numbers of Peo|ple go to the Abbey, &s;o that there is no want of Churches. There is but One Meeting-hou&s;e in this whole Part, which is called Calamy's Meeting, and was formerly &s;upplied by Mr. Stephen Lobb, who, tho' a Di&s;&s;enter, lived and died a Jacobite.</P>
<P>The Cottonian Library is kept here in an Ancient Building, near We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Hall Gate; we were told it would it would be removed to the Royal Li|brary, and then, that it would be re|moved
<PB REF="241">
to a Hou&s;e to be built on Pur|po&s;e; but we &s;ee neither yet in Hand. This is one of the mo&s;t valuable Col|lections in Britain, and&punc; the Bodleian Library excepted, is perhaps, the be&s;t: It has in it &s;ome Books and Manu&s;cripts invaluable for their Antiquity; but I have not Room &s;o much as to enter upon giving an Account of the Parti|culars.</P>
<P>This Part of We&s;tmin&s;ter has but one Street, which gives it a Communication with London, and this is called King $treet, a long, dark, dirty and very in convenient Pa&s;&s;age; but there &s;eems to $e no Remedy for it for mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;en|$ers g$t out of it through th$ P$$vy Gar|$en, and &s;ome be private Pa&s;&s;ages into $he Park, as at Locket's, at the Cock $it, and the new Gate from Queen's-Square; but the&s;e are all upon Suffer|$nce.</P>
<P>From hence we come through two ve|$y hand&s;ome, tho' ancient Gates&punc; into the $pen Palace before White Hall and the $anq$eting-hou&s;e,</P>
<P>Having mentioned White Hall already, have nothing more to &s;ay of it, but $at it was, and is not, but may revive. There is, doubtle&s;s, a n$ble &s;ituation, $word$ to conta$$ a Royal Palace, equal to $er&s;ailles; but I have given you my $houghts on that &s;ubject at large.</P>
<P>Nor can I dwell here upon a De&s;crip|$on of his Maje&s;ty's Court, or an Ac|$ount of the Politicks managed there; does not relate to this Work; let it $ffice to &s;ay, His Maje&s;ty re&s;ides, e&s;|$ecially all the Winter, at St. James's; $t the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Government, is $iefly carried on at the Cock-Pit: This a Royal Building, was once Part of $hite-Hall, fir&s;t the Duke of Monmouth $$ed in it, then Prince George of Den|$ark and his Prince&s;s, afterwards Queen $nn, and &s;ince the Fire at White-Hall, $e Trea&s;ury, the Secretary's Office, the $ou$cil Chamber, the Board of Trade, $d the Lord Chamberlain, hold all their $rticular Offices here; and here there is al&s;o, a By&punc;way out of Duke-&s;treet in the Park.</P>
<P>From thence we come to the Hor&s;e Guards, a Building commodious enough, built on Purpo&s;e as a Barrack for a l$$ge Detachment of the Hor&s;e Guards, who keep their Po&s;t here, while attending on Duty; over it are Offices for Payment of the Troops, and a large Court of Judi|cature&punc; for holding Councils of War, for Tryal of De&s;erters and others, according to the Articles of War.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Range of Buildings, &s;tood the Admiralty Offi$e, built by the late $ing Wi l$a$; but $no' in it&s;elf a &s;paci|ous $word$ is found &s;o much $oo Nar|row $$w $he Bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;o much increa|&s;ed, and as there is a $uffi$$e$t Piece of $word$ G$$nd behind it, to inlarge the Building, we find a new $word$ &s;pac$$us Of|fice is now building in the &s;ame Place, which &s;hall be &s;ufficient to all the U$es required</P>
<P>This Office is, perhaps, of the mo&s;t Importance of any of the publick Parts of the Admini&s;tration, the Royal Navy being the Sinews of o$$ Strength, and the whole Direction of it being in the Hands of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for execut|ing this Office. The Navy and the Vic|tualling Offices, are but Branches of this Admini&s;tration, and receive their Orders from hence, as likewi&s;e the D$$$s and Yards receive their Orders from $word$ Na|vy: The whole being carried on with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Order and Di&s;patch.

<P>From this Part of the Town, we come into the publick Streets, where nothing
<PB REF="242">
more remarkable than the Hurries of $he People; Charing-Cro&s;s is a mixture of Court and City; Man's Coffee-hou&s;e is the Exchange-Alley of this Part of the Town, and 'tis perpetually throng'd with Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, as the others are with Men of Play and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>From hence advancing a little, we &s;ee the great Eque&s;trian Statue of King Charles the fir&s;t in Bra&s;s, a co&s;tly, bu$ a curious Piece; however, it &s;erves &s;ufficiently, to let us know who it is, and why erected there. The Circum&s;tances are Two, he faces the Place where his Enemies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Statue faces the broad Place before White-Hall, where the King was B$h$aded.</NOTE>tri|umph'd over him, and triumphs, that is, tramples in th$ $l$ce where his <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Gibet, where the R$g cides were Executed, $$ood ju&s;t where the Statue now &s;tands.</NOTE>Mur|therers were hang'd.</P>
<P>From this Place d$e North, are the King's Stables&punc; called the Meu&s;e, where the King's Hor&s;es, e&s;pecially his Coach-Hor&s;es, are $ept, and the Coaches of State are &s;et up; it is a very large Place and takes up a great deal of Ground&punc; more than is made U&s;e of; It contains Two large Squares, be&s;ides an Out-let E$&s;t&punc; were is the Managerie for teaching young Gentlemen to Ride the great Saddle; in the middle of the fir&s;t Court is a Smith or Farryer's Hou&s;e and Shop, a Pump and Hor&s;e-Pond; But, lately a noble Building has been erected by the Command of King George the 2d for Stables for his Maje&s;tys Hor&s;es, the like not to be paral|leled in Europe for Statelyne&s;s and Beau|ty.</P>
<P>On the right Side of the Street, com|ing from White-Hall, is Northumberland-Hou&s;e, &s;o called, becau&s;e belonging to the Northumberland Family for &s;ome Ages; but de&s;cending to the Duke of Somer&s;et in Right of Marriage, from the late Dutch|e&s;s, Heire&s;s of the Hou&s;e of Piercy.</P>
<P>'Tis an Ancient, but a very good Hou&s;e, the only Misfortune of its Situation is, its &s;tanding too near the Street; the back Part of the Hou&s;e is more Moderen and beautiful than the Front, and when you enter the Fir&s;t Gate, you come into a noble Square fronting the fine Lodgings: 'Tis a large and very well de&s;ign d Build|ing, and fi$ to receive a Ret$nue of one hundred in Family; nor does the Duke's Family come &s;o far &s;hort of the Number, as not very hand&s;omely to fill the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Duke having mained the greate&s;t Heire&s;s in B$$tain, and enjayed her and the E&s;tate for above $word$ Years, and be&s;ides, having been Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e many Years al&s;o, he is immen&s;ely Rich, and very well me its the good For|tune he has met with.</P>
<P>Advancing hence to the Hay Market, we &s;ee, F &s;t, the great New Theatre, a very magnificent Building, and perfectly accommodated for the End for which it was buil$, tho' the Entertainment there of late, has been chiefly Operas and Balls.</P>
<P>The&s;e Meetings are called BALLS, the Word Ma&s;qu$rade not being &s;o well re|li&s;hed by the Engli&s;h, who, tho' at fir&s;t fond of the Novelty, began to be &s;ick of the Thing on many Accounts: However, as I cannot in Ju&s;tice &s;ay any Thing to recommend th$m&punc; and am by no means, to make this Work be a Satyr upon any Thing; I choo&s;e to &s;ay no more; but go on.</P>
<P>From hence We&s;tward and Northward, lie tho&s;e va&s;tly extended Buildings, which add &s;o exceedingly to the Magnitude of the whole body and of which I have al|ready &s;aid &s;o much: It would be a Task to$ great for this Work, to enter into a De&s;cription of all the fine Hou&s;es, or ra|ther Palaces of the Nobility in the&s;e Parts: To touch them &s;uper&s;icially, and by halves, is too much to imitate what I complain of in others, and as I de&s;ign a particular Account of all the Hou&s;es of the Nobi|lity and Men of Quality in London, and the Country 15 Miles round, in a work

<P>The Ho&s;pitals in and about the City of London, de&s;erve a little further Ob&s;er|vation, e&s;pecially tho&s;e more remarkable for their Mag$$tude, as,</P>
<P N="1">1. Bethlem or Bed$am: This and Bride|well, indeed, go together, for though they are two &s;everal Hou$es, yet they are incorporated together, and have the &s;ame Governors; al&s;o the Pre&s;ident Trea|&s;urer, Clerk, $hy&s;i$ia$ and Apothecary are the &s;ame; but he St. wards and t$e the Revenue are different, and fo are the Benefactions; but to both very great.</P>
<P>The Orders for the Government of the Ho&s;pital of Bethlem are exceeding good; and a remarkable In$ance of the good Di&s;po&s;ition of the Gentlemen concerned in it, e&s;pecially the&s;e that $ollow:</P>
<P N="1">1 That no Per&s;on, except he proper Officers who tend them, be allowed to &s;ee the Lunaticks of a Sunday</P>
<P N="2">2. That no Per&s;on be allowed to give $he $ unaticks &s;trong Drink, Wine, To|$acco or Spirits, or to &s;ell any &s;uch thing $n the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P N="3">3. That no Servant of the Hou&s;e $hall take any Money given to any of $he Lunaticks to their own U&s;e; b$t $hat it &s;hall be carefully kept fot them $ill they are recovered, or laid out for $hem in &s;uch things as the Committee $pproves.</P>
<P N="4">4. That no Officer or Servant &s;hall $eat or abu&s;e, or offer any Force to any $word$ but on ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity. The $e&s;t of the Orders are for the good Go|$ernment of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This Ho&s;pital was formerly in the $treet now called Old Bedlam, and was $ery Ancient and Ruinous: The New $uilding was Erected at the Charge of $word$ City in 1676, and is the mo&s;t beauti|$l Structure for &s;uch a U&s;e that is in the $orld, and was fini&s;hed from its Foun|$tion in Fifteen Months? it was &s;aid to $word$ taken ill at the Court of France, $hat was built after the Fa&s;hion of one of the $word$ of France's Palaces.</P>
<P>The Number of People who are gene, rally under Cure $o this Ho&s;pital, is from 130 to 150 at a Time.</P>
<P>There are great Additions now making to this Ho&s;pital, particularly for the Re|lief and Sub&s;i&s;tence of Incurables, of which no full Account can be given, becau&s;e they are not yet fini&s;hed or the full Re|venue a&s;ce$ta$$ed: The fi$&s;t Benefacter and Author of this D$&s;ign $t$elf, was Sir William Withers late Alderman and who had been Lord Mayor, who left 500 l. to begin it with.</P>
<P N="2">II The Ho&s;pital of Bridewell, as it is an Ho&s;pital, &s;o it is al&s;o a Hou&s;e of Cor|rection The Hou&s;e was formerly the King's City Palace&punc; but granted to the City to be in the Nature of what is now called a Work-hou&s;e, and has been &s;o em|ployed ever &s;ince the Y$a$ 1555.</P>
<P>As $word$ Per&s;ons Vag$ants, &amp;c are com|mitted to this Hou&s;e for Correction, &s;o there are every Year, &s;everal poor Lads brought up to Handicraft Trades, as Ap|prentice, and of the&s;e the Care is in the Governors&punc; who maintain them out of the &s;tanding Revenues of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>There are two other Bridewells, pro|perly &s;o called, that is to &s;ay, Hou&s;es of Correction; one at Clarkenwell, called New Pri&s;on, being the particular Bridewell for the County of Middle$ex, and another in Tuttle-fields, for the City of We&s;t|min&s;ter</P>
<P>The other City Ho&s;pitals, are the Blue|coat Ho&s;pital for poor Fre$mens $word$ Children, and the Two Ho&s;pitals for Sick and Maimed People, as St. $word$ and St. T$oma$s: The&s;e Three are &s;o well known by all People that have &s;een the City o$ London, and &s;o univer|&s;ally mention'd by all who $word$ e written of it, that little can be ne$d$ul to add; however I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething as an Abridg|ment.</P>
<P N="3">III. Chri&s;t's Ho&s;pital was originally con|&s;tituted by King E ward VI. who has the Honour of being the Founder of it, as al|$o of Bridewell? but the original De&s;ign was&punc; and is owing to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, and the Chri|&s;tian
<PB REF="244">
Endeavours of that Glorious Mar|tyr, Dr. Ridley then Bi&s;hop of London, who never cea&s;ed moving his Charitable Ma&s;ter, the King, till he brought him to join in the Foundation. The De&s;ign is for entertaining, educating, nouri&s;hing and bringing up the poor Children of the Cirizens, &s;u$h as, their Parents being dead, or Fathers, at lea&s;t, have no way to be &s;upported, but are reduced to Poverty</P>
<P>Of the&s;e, the ho&s;pital is now &s;o far in|crea&s;ed in &s;ub&s;tance, by the Benefactions of worthy Gentlemen Contributor, they now maintain near a Thou&s;and, who have Food, Clothing and In&s;truction, u&s;eful and &s;ufficient Learning, and ex|ceeding good Di&s;cipline; and at the pro|per Times they are put out to Trades, &s;uitable to their &s;everal Genius's and Ca|pacities, and near Five Thou&s;and Pounds a Year rre expended on this Charity.</P>
<P N="4">IV. St. Bartho$om$w's Ho&s;pital adjoyns to the Chri&s;t Church, and St. Thomas's is in Southwa$k, both which, however, being the &s;ame in kind, their De&s;cription may come under one head, tho' they are, indeed, Two Foundations, and dif|ferently incorporated: The fir&s;t Founder is e&s;teem'd to be King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII who&s;e &s;tatue in &s;tone and very well done, is, for that very rea&s;on lately erected in the new front, over the entrance to the Cloy&s;ter in We&s;t Smithfield: The King gave 500 Marks a Year towards the &s;upport of the hou&s;e, which was then founded for an hundred poor &s;ick, and the City was obliged to add 500 Marks a Year more to it.</P>
<P>From this &s;mall Beginning, this Ho&s;|pital ro&s;e the Gr$an$&s;s we now &s;ee it arrived at, of which take the following Account for one Year, viz, 1718.</P>

<P>This ho&s;pital has received greater Be|nefactions than S.

<P>Adjoining to this of S Thomas's, is lately laid a noble Foundation of a new ho&s;pital, by the charitable Gift and &s;ingle Endowment of one Per&s;on and, perhaps, the greate&s;t of its kind, next to that of Sutton's ho&s;pital, that ever was founded in this Nation by one Per&s;on, whether private or publick, not excepting the Kings them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This is called Guy's ho&s;pital, being built and endowed at the &s;ole Charge of one Mr. Thomas Guy, formerly a Book&s;eller in Lombard &s;treet&punc; who lived to &s;ee the &s;aid ho&s;pital not only de|&s;ign'd, the Ground purcha&s;ed and $$$ared&punc; but the Building begun, and a con&s;idera|ble Progre&s;s made in it.</P>
<P>It was not till this Gentleman died, that the World were told it was to $word$ a &s;eparate ho&s;pital: but it was generally under&s;tood to have been i t$$$$ed $$r $word$ Ward, or an Addition to the old ho&s;pital
<PB REF="245">
of St. Thomas's, for the Reception of &s;uch as were accounted incurable.</P>
<P>But when Mr. Guy died, his Will be|ing made publick, it appeared, that it was really a &s;eparate independant and di&s;tinct Ho&s;pital, under di&s;tinct Governors, and for a &s;eparate Purpo&s;e, to wit, for receiv|ing &s;uch poor Per&s;ons as have been di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed from other Ho&s;pitals as incurable.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e re&s;trained to the Patients of the adjoining Ho&s;pital of St. Tho|mas only; but they are allowed to re|ceive &s;uch from St. Bartholomew's al&s;o, and al&s;o from Bethlehem, only with this Re&s;triction as to the latter, That the Number of Incurable Luna$icks &s;hall ne|$er exceed Twenty at a Time.</P>
<P>This Ho&s;pital is, by Mr. Guy's Will, $o con&s;i&s;t of Two great Squares of Build|$gs, in which, be&s;ides the Offic$s and $ccommodation for nece&s;&s;ary Servants $nd Over&s;eers, who mu&s;t be lodg'd in $e Hou&s;e, &s;uch as Stewards.

<P>What the Revenue, when &s;ettled, will $word$ what the Building will amount to $en fini&s;hed; what the Purcha&s;e of the $nd, and what the Expence of fini&s;hing $d furni&s;hing it&punc; cannot be e&s;timated, till be further look'd into; but we are told $thout Doors, that be&s;ides all the Ex|$ce of Purcha&s;e, Building, Furni&s;hing $d Fini&s;hing as above; there will be $word$ more than Two hundred Thou&s;and $unds for Endowing the Ho&s;pital with $ettled Revenue, for maintaining the $word$ Poor, and yet the charitable Founder $s &s;o immen&s;ely Rich, that be&s;ides $ing Four hundred Pounds a Year to $word$ Blue-coat Ho&s;pital of London, and $des Building an Ho&s;pital for fourteen $r People at Tamworth in Stafford|$e, where he was cho&s;en Repre&s;enta|$; and be&s;ides &s;everal con&s;iderable $rities which he had given in his $&punc;time: He al&s;o gave away, in Lega|cies, to his Relations and others, above a hundred thou&s;and Pounds more, among which 'tis ob&s;ervable, That there is a Thou&s;and Pounds a piece given to nea Eighty &s;everal Per&s;ons, mo&s;t of them of his own Relations; &s;o that he cannot, as has been &s;aid by &s;ome, be &s;aid to give a great Charity to the Poor, and forget his own Family.</P>
<P>How Mr. Guy ama&s;s'd all this Wealth, having been hmm&s;elf in no publick Em|ployment or Office of Tru&s;t, or Profit&punc; and only carrying on the Trade of a Book$eller t$$l within a few Years of his Death, that is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Book; 'tis enough to &s;ay&punc; he was a thriv|ing frugal Man&punc; w$o God was plea&s;ed exceedingly to Ble&s;s, in whatever he &s;et his hand to, knowing to what good Pur|po&s;es he laid up his Gains: He was never Married, and lived to be above Eighty Years old; &s;o that the natural Improve|ments of this Money, by common Inte|re&s;t, after it was fir&s;t grown to a con&s;i|derable Bulk, greatly increa&s;ed the $um.</P>

<P>But the Supplies and Charities to this commendable Work, have not of late come in $o readily as they u&s;ed to d$, which has put the Governors to &s;ome Difficulties; upon which, Ann 1714 $word$ Common Council, by Virtue of the $o$|ers above mentioned, agreed to rai&s;e five thou&s;and Pounds upon the whole City, for the Support of the Hou&s;e; but we do not find that any New Demand has been made &s;ince that.</P>
<P>There are Three con&s;iderable Charities given by private Per&s;ons in the City of We&s;tmin&s;ter, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Gray coat Ho&s;pital, Founded by a generous Sub&s;cription o Contributi|on; but chiefly by the Charity of one&mdash;Sands, E&s;q; It maintains 70 Boys and 40 Girls&punc; cloathed&punc; fed&punc; and taught, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure provided for, by be|ing put out to Trades.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Green coat Ho&s;pital, in the &s;ame Fields, Founded by King Charles I. for poor Fatherle&s;s Children of St. Mar|garet's Pari&s;h; and next to this Ho&s;pital is the Hou&s;e of Correcton, or the We&s;t|min&s;ter Bridewell.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Emanuel Ho&s;pital, Founded by the Lady Ann Dacres, for Ten poor Men, and Ten poor Women, in the Forty-third Year of Queen Elizabeth. Near this, are Seven &s;everal S$tts of Alms hou&s;es; but not of any Magnitude to be called Ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>There has been, al&s;o, a very noble Ho&s;pital erected by Contribution of the French Refuge$$, for the Maintenance of their Poor: It &s;tands near the $word$ u&s;e, in the Foot-way to $&s;lington in $word$ Pa$$h of Cripplegate, and Two Ranges of new Alms-hou&s;es in King&s;land Road beyond Shoreditch Church.</P>
<P>The Ho p$tal call'd the Charter-hou&s;e, or Sutton's Ho&s;pital, is not by this &s;up|po&s;ed to be forgot, or the Honour of it le&s;&s;en'd. On the other hand, i$ m$&s;t $e recorded for ever, to be the greate&s;t and noble&s;t Gift that ever was given $o$ Cha|rity, by any one Man, publick or private, in this Nation, &s;ince Hi&s;tory gives us any Account of Things; even not the great
<PB REF="247">
Bi&s;hop of Norwich excepted, who built the great Church of Yarmouth, the Ca|th$d$al at Norwich, and the Church of St. Mary's at Lynn; The Revenue of Mr. Sutton's Ho&s;pital being&punc; be&s;ides the Pur|cha&s;e of the Place, and the Building of the Hou&s;e, and other Expences little le&s;s than 6000l. per Annum Revenue.</P>
<P>The Royal Ho&s;pitals of Greenwich and Chel&s;ea, are al&s;o not mentioned in this A count, as not being within the Reach of the mo&s;t extended Bounds of the City of London</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal Ho&s;pitals, the re&s;t of &s;maller Note are touch'd before; but it will not be a u&s;ele&s;s Ob&s;ervation, not altogether improper to take notice of $t here, That this Age has produced &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Acts of publick Cha|$ity, and of the greate&s;t Value, I mean from p$i$ate Persons, that can be found $n any Age within the reach of our Eng|$i&s;h Hi&s;tory, excepting only that of S$t|$on's Ho&s;pital; and yet they tell us, that $ven that of Mr. Sutton's is exceeded in $his of Mr. Guy's, con&s;idering that this Gentleman gave a very noble Gift to this $ame Ho&s;pital before; be&s;ides that as be|$ore, he has left an hundred thou&s;and $ounds in private Gifts among his own $elations; as to Children he had none, $r he never was Married.</P>
<P>The other Benefactions, I &s;peak of $hich this Ags has produced, are already $uch'd at in this Work, and may be re|$rred to in the reading, &s;uch as Dr. Rat|$iff's Gift, amounting to above forty $ou&s;and Pounds to the Univer&s;ity of Ox|$rd: The Gift of ten thou&s;and Pounds to $agdalen College in the &s;ame Univer&s;ity, $word$ their late Repre&s;entative; the &s;everal harities of Sir Robert Clayton, Alder|an Ask, Sir Stephen Fox, Dr Busby, $word$ John Morden and others.</P>
<P>The&s;e, added to the innumerabe $word$ of Alms&punc;hou&s;es which are to be &s;een almo&s;t every Part of the City, make it $tain, that there is no City in the World $ &s;hew the like number of Charities $word$ private Hands, there being, as I am $word$ not le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and Peo+ple maintained of Charity, be&s;ides the Charities of Schooling for Children and be&s;ides the Collections yearly at the An|nual Fea&s;ts of &s;everal Kinds, where Mo|ney is given for putting ou$ Ch$ldren Ap|prentices, &amp;c. &s;o that the Romans have $word$ Rea&s;onto boa&s;t, that there were $span$ and Acts of Charity to the $word$ given in their Times, than in our $word$ Times; and this is indeed, one of the principal Rea&s;ons for my $word$ mention of it in this Place; for let $word$ particular Age be &s;ingled out, and let $word$ Charities of this Age, that is to $ay, $word$ about fifteen or twenty years pa&s;t and the Sums of Money be&s;towed by $word$ in this Nation on meer Acts $word$ Charity to the Poor, not reckoning $word$ to the Church&punc; be ca&s;t up it will $word$ they are greater by far, than would $word$ found in England in any the like Number of Years take the Time when we will.</P>
<P>Nor do I conclude in this, the Money Collected by Briefs all over England, u$|on Ca&s;ualties by Fire though that is $word$ eniment Act of Charity as any can be; nor the Money given either in publick $word$ private, for Re-building St. Paul's and other Churches demoli&s;hed by the Fire $word$ London, or the Augmentation of $word$ Benefices by the Bounty of Queen Ann, and many other &s;uch Gifts.</P>
<P>I come now to an Account of new $word$ and publick Buildings, erected or erecting in and about London, &s;ince the foregoing Account; and with this I c$$|clude.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fine new Church of St M r|tin's in the Fields, with a very $$$e Steeple, which they tell us is 215 $word$ high, all wholly built by the $word$ of that great Pari&s;h, and fini&s;hed $word$ the utmo&s;t Expedition.</P>
<P>The new Admiralty Office near Wh$r$ hall&punc; being on the &s;ame Ground where the old Office &s;tood; but much larger, b$ing both longer in Front and deeper Ba$$|ward.</P>
<P>Mr Guy's Ho&s;pital for Incurables&punc; mentioned above, &s;ituated on Ground purcha&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e, adjoynin$ to
<PB REF="248">
St. Thomas's Ho&s;pital in Southwark, and is a mo&s;t magnificent Building.</P>
<P>Two large Wings to the Ho&s;pital of Bedlam, appointed al&s;o for Incurables; propo&s;ed fir&s;t by the charitable Di&s;po&s;i|tion of Sir William Withers, decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>A large new Meeting-hou&s;e in Spittle|fields for the Sect of Di&s;&s;enters, call'd Bapti&s;ts, or Antepaedo Bapti&s;ts.</P>
<P>The South Sea Hou&s;e in Threadn$edle|&s;treet, the old hou&s;e being intirely pul|led down, and &s;everal other hou&s;es ad|joining being purcha&s;ed, the whole Build|ing was new from the foundation.</P>
<P>Several very fine new Churches, be|ing Part of the Fifty Churches appoint|ed by Act of Parliament, viz. One in Spittle fields, one in Radcliff-High-way, one in Old &s;treet, one at Lime hou&s;e, with a very beautiful Tower, and one in Bloomsbury.</P>
<P>The Pari&s;h Church of St. Botolph without Bi&s;hop&s;gate, pulled down and Re&punc;built, by the Contribution of the Inhabitants, not as one of the fifty new Churches.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> In removing the Corp&s;es buried in this Church, they found the Body of Sir <HI>Paul Pindar,</HI> buried there about Eighty Years before, which was ta|ken up and depo&s;ited again; and we are told, a new Monument will be &s;et up for him by the Pari&s;h, to which he was a good Benefactor.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, which &s;ince the late Fire in Thames-&s;treet, is very much in|larged.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Buildings, in their &s;everal Places, be very great Ornaments to the City.</P>
<P>A new Street or Range of hou&s;es ta|ken out of the South &s;ide of the Artille|ry-Ground near Moor-Fields al&s;o an En|largement to the new Burying-Ground as it was formerly called, on the North &s;ide of the &s;ame Ground.</P>
<P>The Iron Ballu&s;trade, or as others call it, Balcony, on the Lanthorn&punc; upon the Cupolo of St. Paul's Church, gilded. It was done at the Co&s;t and as the Gift of an Iri&s;h Nobleman, who &s;carce lived to &s;ee it fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>A new Bear-Garden, called Figg's Thea|ter, being a &s;tage for the Gladiators or Prize&punc;Fighters, and is built on the Ty|burn Road.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Gentlemen of the Science, ta|king Offence at its being called <HI>Ty|burn Road,</HI> though it really is &s;o, will have it called the <HI>Oxford $oad;</HI> this publick Edifice is fully fini&s;hed, and in &V;&s;e.</P>
<P>I conclude this Account of London, with mentioning &s;omething of the Ac|count of Mortality, that is to &s;ay the Births and Burials, from whence Sir Will. Petty thought he $ight make &s;ome Cal|culations $word$ the Numbers of the Inhabi|tants, and I &s;hall only take Notice, that whereas, the general Number of the Burials in the Year 1666, and farther back, were from 17000 to 19000 in a Year, the la&s;t yearly Bill for the Year 1723, amount as follows:</P>
<P>Chri&s;tenings 19203. Burials 29197.</P>
<P>Here is to be ob&s;erved that the Num|ber of Burials exceeding &s;o much the Number of Births, is, becau&s;e as it is not the Number Born, but the Number Chri&s;ten|ed that are &s;et down, which is taken from the Pari&s;her Regi&s;ter; &s;o all the Chil|dren of Di&s;&s;enters of every &s;ort, Pro|te&s;tant, Popi&s;h and Jewi&s;h and omitted, al&s;o all the Children of Foreigners, French, Dutch, &amp;c. which are Baptized in their own Churches, and all the Children of tho&s;e who are &s;o poor, that they can|not get them Regi&s;tred: So that if a due E&s;timate be made, the Births may be very well &s;uppo&s;ed to exceed the Burials one Year with another by many Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>It is not that I have no more to &s;ay of London, that I break off here; but that I have no Room to &s;ay it, and tho' &s;ome Things may be taken Notice of
<PB REF="249" MS="Y">
by others, which I have pa&s;s'd over; yet I have al&s;o taken Notice of &s;o ma|ny Things which others have omitted, that I claim the Ballance in my Favour.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY VI.</HEAD>
<P>I Have &s;pent &s;o much Time, and ta|ken up &s;o much room in my De|&s;cription of London, and the adja|cent Parts, that I mu&s;t be the more cautious, at lea&s;t, as to needle&s;s Excur|&s;ions in the Country near it.</P>
<P>The Villages round London partake of the Influence of Lo don, &s;o much, that it is ob&s;erv'd as London is Encrea&s;ed, &s;o they are all Encrea&s;ed al&s;o, and from the &s;ame Cau&s;es:</P>
<P>I have taken notice of this in my fir&s;t &s;etting out, and particularly in the Counties of E&s;&s;ex, Kent, and Surrey; and as the &s;ame appears to an extreme in Middle&s;ex: I &s;hall only give &s;ome Di&s;|criptions, and &s;ay the le&s;s of the rea&s;on of it</P>
<P>Hackney and Bromley are the fir&s;t Villages which begin the County of Middle&s;ex, Ea&s;t; for Bow as reckon'd to S$epney, is a Part of the Great Ma&s;s. This Town of Hackney is of a great Extent, containing no le&s;s then 12 Hamlets $word$ &s;eparate Villages, tho' &s;ome of them $ow join, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Church &s;treet,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hummerton,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Wych-Hou&s;e,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Grove-&s;treet,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Clapton,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mare-&s;treet,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Well-&s;treet,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cambridge-Heath,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Shacklewell,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dal&s;tone,</ITEM>
<ITEM>King&s;land,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Newington,</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>All the&s;e, tho' &s;ome of them are very large Villages, make up but one Pari&s;h (viz.) of Hackney.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, except the Wych hou&s;e, are within a few Years &s;o increas'd in Build|ings, and &s;o fully inhabited, that there is no Compari&s;on to be made between their pre&s;ent and pa&s;t State: Every &s;e|parated Hamlet is Encreas'd, and &s;ome of them more than Treble as big as for|merly: Indeed as this whole Town is|included in the B lls of Mortality, tho' no where joining to London, it is in &s;ome re&s;pects to be call'd a part of it.</P>
<P>This Town is &s;o remarkable for the retreat of Wealthy Citizens, that there is at this time near a hundred Coaches kept in it; tho' I will not join with a certain Satyrical Author, who &s;aid of Hackney, that there were <HI>more Coaches than Chri&s;tians in it.</HI></P>
<P>Newington, Tottenham, Edmonton, and Enfield &s;tand all in a Line North from the City; the encrea&s;e of Buildings is &s;o great in them all, that they &s;eem to a Traveller to be one continu'd Street; e&s;pecially at Tottenham and Edmonton, and in them all, the New Buildings &s;o far excetp the Old, e&s;pecially in the value of them, and figure of the Inha|bitants, that the fa&s;hion of the Towns are quite altered,</P>
<P><PB REF="250">
At Tottenham we &s;ee the remains of an Antient Building called the Cro&s;s, from which the Town takes the Name of High-Cro&s;s. There is a long Account of the Antiquities of this Place lately Publi&s;hed, to which I referr, Antiquities, as I have ob&s;erved, not being my Province in this Work, but a De&s;cription of Things in their pre&s;ent State.</P>
<P>Here is at this Town a &s;mall but plea|&s;ant Seat of the Earl of Colerain, in Ire|land; his Lord&s;hip is now on his Travails, but has a very good E&s;tate here extend|ing from this Town to Muzzle-hill, and almo&s;t to High gate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing we &s;ee in Tottenham is a &s;mall but Beautiful Hou&s;e, built by one Mr. Wanly, forme ly a Gold$mith, near Temple-Bar; it is a &s;mall Hou&s;e, but for the Beauty of the Building and the Gardens, it is not outdone by any of the Hou&s;es on this &s;ide the Country.</P>
<P>There is not any thing more fine in their Degree, than mo&s;t of the Buildings this way; only with this Ob&s;ervation, that they are generally belonging to the middle &s;ort of Mankind, grown Wealthy by Trade, and who &s;till ta&s;te of London; &s;ome of them live both in the City, and in the Country at the &s;ame time: yet many of the&s;e are immen&s;ly Rich.</P>
<P>High-gate and Ham&s;tead are next on the North-&s;ide; At the fir&s;t is a very beautiful Hou&s;e built by the late Sir William A&s;hur&s;t, on the very &s;ummit of the Hill, and with a view from the very lowe&s;t Windows over the whole Vale, to the City: And that &s;o eminently, that they &s;ee the very Ships pa&s;&s;ing up and down the River for 12 or 15 Miles be|low London. The Jews have particularly fixt upon this Town for their Country Retreats, and &s;ome of them are very Wealthy; they live there in good Figure, and have &s;everal Trades particularly de|pending upon them, and e&s;pecially, Burch|ers of their own to &s;upply them with Pro|vi&s;ions kill'd their own way; al&s;o, I am told, they have a private Synagogue here.</P>
<P>As the County does not extend far this way, I take notice of &s;maller Towns&punc; nor is there any thing of Note but Citi|zens Hou&s;es for &s;everal Miles; except that in the Cha&s;e, at Enfield is a fine Lodge formerly po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Earl of Denbigh; N$w we are told that General Pepper is fixt a Rnger of the Cha&s;e, and re&s;ides there.</P>
<P>This Cha&s;e was once a very beautiful Place, and when King James I. re&s;ided at Theobalds, which he loved for the Plea&s;ure of his Hunting; it was then ve|ry full of Deer, and all &s;orts of Game; but it has &s;uffered &s;everal Depredations &s;ince that, and particularly in the late Pro|tector's U&s;urpation, when it was utterly &s;tript, both of Game and Timber, and let out in Farms to $enants, for the u&s;e of the Publick.</P>
<P>After the Re&s;toration, it was rea&s;&s;um|ed, and laid open again; Woods and Groves were every where Planted, and the whole Cha&s;e &s;tored with Deer: But the young Timber which indeed began to thrive, was &s;o continually Plundered, and the Deer-&s;tealers have &s;o Harra&s;s'd the Deer, and both perhaps by tho&s;e who &s;hould have pre&s;erved it, as well as by others, that the Place was almo&s;t ruined for a Forre&s;t, and little but Hares and Bu&s;hwood was to be found in it. But now we hear, that by the Vigilance of General Pepper, the Cha&s;e is much re|covered, and likely to be a Place fit for the Diver&s;ion of a Prince, as it has been before.</P>
<P>At a Village a little farther North, cal|led Totteridge, Mr. Charleton of the Ord|nance Office, has a very delicious Seat, the Hou&s;e new Built, and the Gardens ex|tremely Fine: In the &s;ame Town the old E$$l of Angle&s;ey had al&s;o a Hou&s;e, but not Extraordinary for any thing more than rural Situation, very retired, but yet very agreeable.</P>
<P>The Mineral Waters, or Barnet Wells, are a little beyond this Hou&s;e, on the De|clivity of a Hill; they were formerly in great Reque&s;t, being very much approved by Phy&s;icians; but of late, they began
<PB REF="251">
$o decline, and are now almo&s;t forgotten: Other Waters at I&s;lington, and at Ham|$tead having grown Popular in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>Hamp&s;tead indeed is ri&s;en from a little Country Village, to a City, not upon the Credit only of the Waters, tho' 'tis ap|$arent, its growing Greatne&s;s began there; $nt Company increa&s;ing gradually, and the $eople liking both the Place and the Diver|$ons together; it grew &s;uddenly populous, $nd the Concour&s;e of People wa$ $word$ This con&s;equently rai&s;ed the Rate of Lodgings, and that encrea$ed Buildings, $word$ the Town grew up from a little Vil|ge, to a Magnitude equal to &s;ome Cities; $r could the uneven Surface, inconveni|$t for Building, uncompact and unplea|$$, check the humour, of the Town, $ even on the very &s;teep of the Hill, $ere there's no walking Twen y Yards $e her, without Tugging up a Hill, or $adling down a Hill&punc; yet 'tis all one, the $lding; encrea&s;ed to that degree, that $ Town almo&s;t &s;preads the whole &s;ide the Hill.</P>
<P>On the Top of the Hill indeed&punc; there $word$ very plea&s;ant Plain, called the Heath, $ich on the very Summit, is a Plain of $ut a Mile every way, and in good $ather 'tis plea&s;ant airing upon it, and $e of the Streets are extended &s;o $ar, $hat they begin to build, even on the $e&s;t Part of the Hill. But it mu&s;t be $e&s;t, 'tis &s;o near Heaven that I dare &s;ay it can be a proper Situation, for $word$ but a race of Mountainers, who$e $word$ have been u&s;$d to a ra$ify'd $word$ nearer the &s;econd Region, than any $nd for 30 Miles round it.</P>
<P>$is true, this Place may be &s;aid to be $word$ for a Summer Dwelling, for in $er nothing that I know can $word$ $word$ i$: 'Tis true, a warm Hou&s;e, and $word$ Company, both which are to be had $word$ go a great way to make amends for $s, and &s;everity of Cold.</P>
<P>$re is mo&s;t beautiful Pro&s;pect indeed, $e &s;ee here Han&s;lop Steeple one way, $word$ is within eight Miles of $word$ $. W. to Landown-hill in E&s;&s;ex $word$ $ay, Ea&s;t, at lea&s;t 66 Miles from one another; the pro&s;pect to London, and beyond it to Ban&s;$ed Downs, South&punc; Shooters-hill, S. E. Red hill, S. W. and Wind&s;or&punc;Ca&s;tle, W. is al&s;o uninterrupted: Indeed due North, we &s;ee no farther than to Barnet, which is not above &s;ix Miles; but the re&s;t i$ &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>At the Foot of this Hill is an old Seat of the Earls of Che&s;terfields, called Bell|&s;ize; which for many Years had been neglected, and as it were forgotten: But being taken lately by a certain Projector to get a Penny, and who knew by what Handle to take the gay Part of the World, he has made i$ a true Hou&s;e of Plea$u$e; here, in the Gardens he entertained the Company with $word$ kind of Sport and in the Hou&s;e with all kinds of Game&punc; to &s;ay no more of it: This brought a wonder|ful Concour&s;e of People to the Place, for they were &s;o effectually gratified in all &s;orts of Diver&s;ion, that the Wicked part at length broke in, till it alarm'd the Ma|gi&s;trates, and I am told it has been now in a manner &s;uppre&s;s'd by the hand of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Here was a great Room fitted up with abundance of Dexterity for their Balls, and $ad it gone on to a degree of Ma&s;|querading, as I hear was $ctualy begun, it would have bid fair to have ha$ half the Town run to it: One &s;$w Pictures and Furniture there beyond what was to have been expected in a me$r Publick Hou&s;e; and 'tis hardly credible how it drew Com|pany to it; But it could not be, no Briti&s;h Government could be &s;uppo&s;ed to bear long with the Liberties taken on &s;uch Publick Occa&s;ions&punc; So as I have &s;aid, they are reduc'd, at lea&s;t $e&s;trained from Liberties which they could not pre&s;erve by their Prudence.</P>
<P>Yet Hamp&s;te$d is not much the &s;e&s;s fre|quented for this. But as there is (e&s;peci|ally at the Wells) a Conflux of all Sorts of Company, even Hamp&s;teadit le&s;&s; has &s;uf|fered in its good Name; and you &s;ee &s;ome|times more Gallantry than Mode&s;ty: So that the Ladies who value their Reputati|on, have of late more avoided the Wells
<PB REF="252">
and Walks at Hamp&s;tead, than they had formerly done.</P>
<P>I could not be at Hamp&s;tead, and not mak e an Excur&s;ion to Edgworth, a lit|tle Market Town, on the Road to St. Albans; I &s;ay to St. Albans, becau&s;e 'tis certain, that this was formerly the only or the main Road from London to St. Albans; being the famous High Road, called Watling-&s;treet, which in former times reached from London to Shrews|bury&punc; and on towards Wales.</P>
<P>The Remains of this Road are &s;till to be &s;een here, and particularly in this, viz. That from Hyde Park Corner, ju&s;t where Tyburn &s;tands, the Road makes one &s;traight Line without any turning, even to the very Town of St Albans In this Road lies the Town of <HI>St&punc;</HI> Al|bans. In this Road lies the Town of Edgworth&punc; &s;ome will have it that it was built by King Edgar the Saxon Monarch, and called by his Name, and &s;o will have the Town called Edgar, and that it was built as a Garri&s;on on the &s;aid Watling|&s;treet to pre&s;erve the highway from Thieves: But all this I take to be fabu|lous, and without Authority.</P>
<P>Near this Town, and which is the rea|&s;on of naming it, the pre&s;ent Duke of Chandos has built a mo&s;t Magnificent Pa|lace or Man&s;ion hou&s;e, I might &s;ay the mo&s;t Magnificent in England: It is erec|ted where formerly &s;tood an old &s;eat be|longing to Sir Lancelot Lake, who&s;e &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;truggled hard to be cho&s;en Repre&s;entative for the Country, but lo&s;t it, and had a great Intere&s;t and E&s;tate hereabouts.</P>
<P>This Palace is &s;o Beautiful in its &s;itu|ation, &s;o Lofty, &s;o Maje&s;tick the Appear|ance of it, that a Pen can but ill de&s;cribe it, the Pencil not much better; 'tis only fit to be talk'd of upon the very &s;pot, when the Building is under View to be con&s;ider'd in all its Parts.</P>
<P>The Fronts are all of Free&s;tone, the Columns and Pila&s;ters are Lofty and Beautiful, the Windows very high, with all po&s;&s;ible Ornaments: The Pila&s;ters running flu&s;h up to the Corni&s;h and Archi|trave, their Capitals &s;eem as &s;o many &s;upporters to the fine Statues which &s;tand on the Top, and crown the whole; in a word, the whole Structure is built with &s;uch a Profu&s;ion of Expence, and all fini&s;h'd with &s;uch a Brightne&s;s of Fancy, Goodne&s;s of Judgment; that I can a&s;&s;ure you, we &s;ee many Palaces of Sovereign Princes abroad, which do not equal it, which yet pa&s;s for very fine too either within or without. And $word$ it is a noble and well contriv'd Bu$d|ing; &s;o it is as well &s;et out, an$ $word$ Ornament is wanting to make it the $word$ hou&s;e in England. The Pla&s;tering and Gilding is done by the famous $word$ an Italian, &s;aid to be the $word$ $word$ in tho&s;e particular Works now in Eng|land The great Salon o$ Hall is pain$e$ by <HI>Pa$lucci,</HI> for the Duke &s;pared no $word$ to have every thing as rich as po&s;&s;ible The Pillars, &s;upporting the building an$ all of Marble: The great Stair ca&s;e $word$ the fine&s;t by far of any in England; an$ the &s;teps are all of Marble, ever&punc; &s;tep be|ing of one whole Piece, about 22 $word$ in Length.</P>
<P>Nor is the &s;plendor which the pre|&s;ent Duke lives in at this $ ace, at $word$ beneath what &s;uch a Building calls fo$ and yet, &s;o far is the Duke from h$|ving exhau&s;ted him&s;ef by this Prod$ of a Building; that we &s;ee him $word$ that laying out a &s;cheme, and &s;torin, $word$ Materials for Building another hou&s;e $word$ his City Convenience, on the $word$ &s;ide of the New Square, call'd $word$ or Cavendi&s;h Square, near Maryboa$ and if that is di&s;continued, it &s;eems be &s;o, only becau&s;e the Duke found Opportunity to purcha&s;e another $word$ more to his Advantage; Namely&punc; $word$ Duke of Ormond's hou&s;e in St. Jame$ Square.</P>
<P>It is in&punc; vain to attempt to $word$ the Beauties of this Building at Cann$$ the whole is a Beauty, and as the $word$ is a Glorious Mantle fi$led $word$ or as it were made up of a $word$
<PB REF="253">
of le&s;&s;er Glories the Stars; &s;o every part of this Building adds to the Beauty of the whole. The Avenue is &s;pacious and maje&s;tick, and as it gives you the view of two Fronts, join'd as it were in one, the Di&s;tance not admitting you to &s;ee the Angle, which is in the Centre; &s;o you are agreeably drawn in, to think the Front of the hou&s;e almo&s;t twice as large as it really is.</P>
<P>And yet when you come nearer you are again &s;urprized, by &s;eeing the Wind|ing Pa&s;&s;age opening as it were a new Front to the Eye, of near 120 Foot wide, which you had not &s;een before, &s;o that you are lo&s;t a while in looking near hand for what you &s;o evidently &s;aw a great off. Tho' many of the Palaces in Italy are very large fine Buildings, yet I venture to &s;ay, not Italy it &s;elf can &s;how &s;uch a Building rais'd from the common Surface, by one private $and, and in &s;o little a time as this: For Cau|$ons as I was inform'd, was not three Years a building and bunging the Gardens and all, to the mo&s;t fini&s;h'd Beauty we $ow &s;ee it in.</P>
<P>The great Palaces in Italy, are either he work of Sovereign Princes, or have $een Ages in their Building; one Family $ying the De&s;ign, and ten &s;ucceeding Ages nd Families being taken up, in carrying n the Building: But Cannons had not een three Years in the Duke's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, efore we &s;aw this Prodigy ri&s;e out of the $round, as if he had been re&s;olv'd to $erit that <HI>Motto</HI> which the French King Tum'd, <HI>He &s;aw, and it was made.</HI></P>
<P>The Building is very Lofty, and Mag|$ficent, and the Gardens are &s;o well de|gned, and have &s;o va&s;t a Variety, and e Canals are &s;o large, that they are not be out done in England; po&s;&s;ibly the $rd Ca&s;tlemain's at Wan&s;tead, may be d to equal but cannot exceed them.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of this Hou&s;e is as Glori|s, as the out&s;ide is Fine; the Lodgings $word$ indeed mo&s;t exqui&s;ite'y fini&s;h'd, and I may call it &s;o, royally furni&s;h'd; $word$ Chapel is a Singularity, not only in Building, and the Beauty of its Work|man&s;hip, but in this al&s;o, that the Duke maintains there a full Choir, and has the Wor&s;hip perform'd there with the be&s;t Mu&s;ick, after the manner of the Chappel Royal, which is not done in any other Nobleman's Chappel in Britain; no not the Prince of Wales's, though Heir Apparent to the Crown.</P>
<P>Nor is the Chappel only furni&s;h'd with &s;uch excellent Mu&s;ick, but the Duke has a Set of them to entertain him every Day at Dinner.</P>
<P>The Avenues and Vi&s;ta's to this Hou&s;e are extreamly Magnificent, the great Walk of chief Avenue is near a Mile in length, planted with two double Rows of Trees, and the middle Walk broad enough for a Troop of Hor&s;e to march in Front; in the middle way there is a large Ba&s;in or Fountain of Water and the Coaches drive round it on either &s;ide; there are three other Avenues exceeding fine, but not &s;o very large; the Beauty of them all will double with time, when the Trees may be grown, like tho&s;e of New-Hall, in E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>Two things extreamly add to the Beau|ty of this Hou&s;e, namely, the Chappel, and the Library; but I cannot enlarge, having taken up &s;o much Room in the View of this Hou&s;e, as mu&s;t oblige me to abate in Others, to whom I am willing to do what Ju&s;tice I can.</P>
<P>In his Gardens and Out hou&s;es the Duke keeps a con&s;tant Night&punc;Guard, who take ca$e of the whole Place, duly walk the Rounds, and con&s;tantly give the hour to the Family at &s;et appointed Places and Times; &s;o that the Hou&s;e has &s;ome waking Eyes about it, to keep out Tkieves and Spoilers Night and Day. In a Word, no Nobleman in England, and very few in Europe, live in greater Splendor, or maintains a Grandeur and Magnificence, equal to the Duke of Chandos.</P>
<P>Here are continually maintained, and that in the deare&s;t Part of England, as to Hou&s;e Expences, not le&s;s than One Hundred and Twenty in Family, and yet a Face of Plenty appears in every Part of it; nothing needful is with-held,
<PB REF="254">
nothing plea&s;ant is re&s;trained; every Ser|vant in the Hou&s;e is made ea&s;y, and his Life confortable; and they have the Feli|city that it is their Lord's De&s;ire and De|light that it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>But I am not writing Panegyrick. I left Cannons with regreat, the Family all Gay, and in Raptures on the Marriage of the Marquis of Caernarvon, the Dukes elde&s;t Son, ju&s;t then Celebrated with the Lady Katharine Ta ma&s;h Daughter of the Earl of Dy&s;ert, which Marriage adds to the Honour and E&s;tate al&s;o of the Family of Chandos.</P>
<P>Two Mile from hence, we go up a &s;mall A$cant by the great Road which for what rea&s;on I know not, is there cal|led Crab Tree Orchard, when leaving the Street Way on the Right, we enter a Spa|cious Heath or Common call'd Bu&s;hy|heath, where&punc; again, we have a very a|greeable Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>I cannot but remember, with &s;ome Satis|faction, that having two Foreign Gentle|men in my Company in our pa&s;&s;ing over this Heath, I &s;ay I could not but then ob|&s;erve, and now remember it with Satis|faction, how they were &s;urprized at the Beauty of this Pro&s;pect, and how they look'd at one another, and then again turn|ing their Eyes every way id a kind of Wonder, one of them &s;aid to the other, That England was not like other Coun|try's&punc; but it was all a planted Garden.</P>
<P>They had there on the right Hand, the Town of St. Albans in their View; and all the Spaces between, and further beyond it, look'd indeed like a Garden. The in|clos'd Corn-Fields made one grand Par|terre, the thick planted Hedge Rows, like a Wilderne&s;s of Labyrinth, divided in E&s;pa|liers; the Villiages inter&s;pers'd, look'd like &s;o many &s;everal Noble Seats of Gentle|men at a Di&s;tance. In a Word, it was all Nature, and yet look'd all like Art; on the left Hand we &s;ee the We&s;t End of London, We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey&punc; and the Par|liament-hou&s;e, but the Body $f the City was cut off by the Hill, at wh$$h Hamp|&s;tead intercepted the Sight on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>More to the South we had Hampton Court, and S. W. Wind&s;or, and between both, all tho&s;e mo&s;t Beautiful Parts of Middle&s;ex and Surry, on the Bank of the Thames&punc; of which I have a ready &s;aid $word$ much, and which are indeed the mo&s;t agreeable in the World.</P>
<P>At the farther End of this Heath, i$ the Town of Bu&s;hy, and at the End o$ the Town, $h Earl of E&s;&s;ex has a very good old Seat, &s;ituate in a plea&s;ant Park at Ca&s;hiobe$y; a little farther, is the Town of Hem&s;tead, noted for an extraor+dinary Corn-Market, and at A&s;h$dge, near Hem&s;tead, is an antient Man&s;ion Hou&s;e of the Duke of Bride-water, both the&s;e are old Built Hou&s;es, but both &s;hew the Greatne&s;s of the Antient Nobili$y in the Grandeur and Maje&s;ty of the Building and in the well planted Parks, and high grown Woods, with which they are &s;ur|rounded, than which, there are few fine$ in England.</P>
<P>St. Albans is the Capital Town, tho' not the County Town of H$$t$o d&s;hire, it has a great Corn Market and is famous for its antient Church, built on the Ruins, or part of the Ruins of the mo&s;t famous Abbey of Verulam; the Greatne&s;s of which, is to be judg'd by the old Walls, which one fees for a Mile before we come to Town.</P>
<P>In this Church, as &s;ome Workmen were digging for the Repairs of the Church, they found &s;ome Steps which led to a Door in a very thick Stone Wall, which being opened, there was di&s;cover'd an arched Stone Vaulr, and in the middle of it a large Coffin near 7 Foot long, which being open'd, there was in it the Corps of a Man, the Fle&s;h not bon$um'd, but di&s;colour'd; by the Arms and other Paint|ing on the Wad, it appear'd that this mu&s;t be the Body of Humphry Duke of Glou|ce&s;ter, one of the Sons of Henry IV. and Brother to King Henry V. and by the mo&s;t indi&s;putable Authority, mu&s;t have lain Buried there 277 Years</P>

<P>At Tring abovenam'd is a mo&s;t delici|ous Hou&s;e, built a la Modern$, as the French call it, by the late Mr. Guy&punc; who was for many Years Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, and continued it till near his Death; when he was &s;ucceeded by the late Mr. Lowndes. The late King Wil|liam did Mr. Guy the Honour to dine at this Hou&s;e, when he &s;et out on his Ex|pedition to Ireland, in the Year 1690, the &s;ame Year that he $ought the Battle of the Boyn; and tho' his Maje&s;ty came from London that Morning, and was re|&s;olv'd to lye that Night at Northampton, yet he would not go away without taking a look at the fine Gardens, which are perhaps the be&s;t fini&s;h'd in the wor&s;t Situ|ation of any in England. This Hou&s;e was afterwards bought by Sir William Gore, a Merchant of London; and left by him to his elde&s;t Son, who now en|joys it.</P>
<P>There was an eminent Conte&s;t here be|tweed Mr. Guy, and the Poor of the Par|i&s;h, about his Enclo&s;ing part of the Com|mon to make him a Park; Mr. Guy pre|&s;uming upon his Power, &s;et up his Pales, and took in a large parcel of open Land, call'd Wiggington-Common; the Cattagers and Farmers oppos'd it, by their Com|plaints a great while; but finding he went on with his Work, and re&s;olved to do it, they ro&s;e upon him, pull'd down his Banks, and forced up his Pales, and car|ried away the Wood, or &s;et it on a Heap and burnt it; and this they did &s;everal Times, till he was oblig'd to de&s;i&s;t; after &s;ome time he began again $ffering to treat with the People, and to give them any Equivalent for it: But that not being &s;atis|factory, they mobb'd him again. How
<PB REF="259">
they accommodated it at la&s;t, I know not; but I &s;ee that Mr. Gore has a Park, and a very good one but not large: I mention this as an In&s;tance of the popular Claim in England; which we call right of Com|monage, which the Poor take to be as much their Property, as a Rich Man's Land is his own.</P>
<P>But to return to the Vale of Aylesbury. Here the great and antient Family of Hampden flouri&s;h'd for many Ages, and had very great E&s;tates: But the pre&s;ent H$i may (I doubt) be &s;aid, not to have had equal Succe&s;s with &s;ome of his An|ce&s;tors</P>
<P>From Thame, a great Corn Market, the Thame joins the other Branch call'd al&s;o the Thames, at a little Town called Dorche&s;ter. I ob&s;erve that mo&s;t of our Hi&s;torians reject the Notion that Mr. Cambden make &s;o many Foluri&s;hes about, $f the Marriage of Thame and I&s;&s;s; that his lit le River was called the Thame, and he other, the I&s;&s;s; and that being joined. hey obtained the united Name of Thami&s;is. $ay they reject it, and &s;o do&punc; At this $word$ Town of Dorche&s;ter was once the $word$ of the Bi&s;hopri$k of $incoln.</P>
<P>From hence I came to Oxford, $ Name $own throughout the Learned World; $ity famous in our Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory for $eral Things, be&s;ides its being an Vni|$&s;ity.</P>
<P N="1">1. So Eminent for the goodne&s;s of its $word$ and Healthy Situation; that our $word$ have no le&s;s than three Times, if Information is right, retired hither, $word$ London has been vi&s;ited with the $lence; and here they have been al|$s &s;afe.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o &s;everal Times been the eat of our Princes, when the re&s;t of $ingdom has been embroiled in War Rebellion; and here they have found Safety and Support; at lea&s;t, as long $word$ Loyal Inhabitants were able to pro|hem.</P>
<P>It was famous for the noble Defence eligion, which our fir&s;t Reformers $a$tyrs made here, in their Learned $word$ Di&s;putations again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, in behalf of the Prote&s;tant Religion; and their triumphant clo&s;ing the Debates, by laying down their Lives for the Truths which they a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was likewi&s;e famous for re&s;i&s;ting the Attacks of Arbitrary Power, in the Affair of Magdalen College, in King James's II time; and the Fellows laying down their Fortunes, tho' not their Lives&punc; in Defence of Liberty and Property.</P>
<P>This, to u&s;e a Scripture Elegance, is that City of Oxford; the greate&s;t (if not the mo&s;t A$tte$$) Univer&s;ity in this I&s;land of Great Britain; and perhaps the mo&s;t Flouri&s;hing at this Time, in Men of Polite Learning, and in the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Ma&s;ters, in all Sciences, and in all the Parts of acquired Knowledge in the World.</P>
<P>I know there is a long Conte&s;t, and yet undetermin'd be$een the two Engli&s;h Univer&s;ities, about the Antiquity of their Foundation; and as they have not decided it them&s;elves, Who am I? and what is this Work? that I &s;hould pretend to enter up|on that important Que&s;tion, in &s;o &s;mall a Trace?</P>
<P>It is out of Que&s;tion, that in the large|ne&s;s of the Place, the Beauty of Situati|on, the Number of Inhabitants, and of Schollars, Oxford has the advantage But Fame tell us, that as Great and Applaud|ed Men, as much recommended, and as much recommending them&s;elves to the World and as many of them have been produced from Cambridge, as from Ox|ford.</P>
<P>Oxford has &s;everal things as a Univer|&s;ity, which Cambridge has not&punc; and Cam|bridge ought not to be $o meanly thought of, but that it has &s;everal things in it, which cannot be found in Oxford. For Example,</P>
<P>The Theater, the Mu&s;eum, or Cham|ber of Rarities, the Bodleian Library, the number of Colleges, and the Magnificence of their Buildings are on the &s;ide of Ox|ford, yet Kings, College Chappel, and College, is in favour of Cambridge; for as it is now Edifying, it is likely to be
<PB REF="260">
the mo&s;t admir'd in a few Years of all the Colleges of the Word.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid &s;omething of Cambridge; I ll be as brief about Oxford as I can: It is a noble Flouri&s;hing City, &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all that can contribute to make the Re&s;idence of the Scholars ea&s;y and comfortable, that no Spot of Ground in England goes be|yond it. The Situation is in a delight|ful Plain on the Bank of a fine Naviga|ble River, in a plentiful Country, and at an ea&s;y Di&s;tance from the Capital City, the Port of the Country.</P>
<P>The City it&s;elf is large, &s;trong, popu|lous, and rich; and as it is adorn'd by the mo&s;t beautiful Building of the Colle|ges, and Halls, it makes the mo&s;t noble Figure of any City of its Bigne&s;s in Eu|rope</P>
<P>To enter into the Detail or De&s;cription of all the Colleges, Halls, &amp;c. would be to write a Hi&s;tory of Oxford, which in &s;o little a Compa&s;s as this Work can afford mu&s;t be &s;o imperfect, &s;o &s;uperficial, and, &s;o fa$ from giving a Stranger a true Idea of the Place&punc; that it &s;eems ridiculous, even to think it can be to any ones Sa|tisfaction.

<P>Be&s;ides the Colleges&punc; &s;ome of which are extremely fine and magnificent: There are &s;ome publick Buildings which make a mo&s;t glorious Appearance: The fir&s;t and greate&s;t of all is the Theatre, a Building not to be equall'd by any thing of its kind in the World; no, not in Italy it&s;elf: Not that the Building of the Theatre here is as large as Ve&s;pa&s;ian's or that of of Trajan at Rome; niether would any thing of that kind be an Ornament at this time, becau&s;e not at all &s;uited to the Occa&s;ion, the u&s;es of them being quite dif|ferent.</P>
<P>We &s;ee by the remains that tho&s;e Am|phitheatres, as they were for the Exer|ci&s;e of their publick Shews, and to en|tertain a va&s;t concour&s;e of People, to &s;ee the fighting of the Gladiators, the throwing Criminals to the wild Bea&s;ts, and the like&punc; were rather great Magni|ficent Bear Gardens, than Theatres, for the Actions of &s;uch Repre&s;entations, as entertain'd the Polite part of the World; con&s;equently tho&s;e were va&s;t Piles of Build|ing proper for the u&s;es for which they were Built.</P>
<P>What Buildings were then made u&s;e of in Rome for the fine Performances of&mdash;who acted that of <HI>Terence,</HI> or who wrote that; we can be certain of; but I think I have a great deal of rea|&s;on to &s;ay, they have no remains of them, or any one of them at Rome&punc; or if they are, they come not near to this Building.</P>
<P>The Theatre at Oxford prepared for the publick Exerci&s;es of the Schools, and for the operations of the Learned Part of the Engli&s;h World only, is in its Grandeur and Magnificence, infinitely &s;u|perior to any thing in the World of of its Kind; it is a fini&s;h'd Piece, as to its Building, the front is exqui&s;itely fine, the Columns and Pila&s;ters regular, and very beautiful; 'tis all built of Free-&s;tone: The Model was approved by the be&s;t Ma&s;ters of Architecture at that time, in the pre&s;ence of King Charles II, who was him&s;elf a very curious Ob&s;erver, and a good Judge: Sir Chri&s;topher Wren was the Director of the Work, as he was the Per&s;on that drew the Model: Archbi&s;hop Sheldon, they tell us, paid for it, and gave it to the Univer&s;ity: There is a world of Decoration of in the front of it, and more beautiful Additions, by way of Or|nament, be&s;ides the ancient in&s;cription, that is to be &s;een any where in Europe; at lea&s;t, where I have been.</P>
<P>The Bodlein Library is an Ornament in it &s;elf worthy of Oxford, where its &s;ta|tion

T$e Hi&s;tory of it as large as is found in Mr. Speed, and &s;everal Authors of good Cre|dit; containing in Brief, that of the old Library, the fir&s;t publick one in Oxford, erected in Durham now Trinity College, by Richard Bi&s;hop of Durham, and Lord Trea&s;u$er o Edward III It was afterward joined to another, founded by Cobham Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, and both inlarg'd by the Bounty of H$$ph$y Duke of Glouce&s;ter, founder of the Divinity Schools: I &s;ay, the&s;e Libraries being lo&s;t, and the Books embezzied by the many Charges and Hurries of the Suppre&s;&s;ions in the Reign of Henry VIII&punc; the Commi$ion|ers appointed by King Edward VI. to vi&s;it the Univer&s;ities, and e&s;tabli&s;h the Reformation; found very few valuable Books or Manu&s;cripts left in them.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of Things one Sir Tho|mas B$dley a wealthy and learned Knight $ealous for the Encouragement b$th of Learning and Religion, re&s;olv'd to apply, $o$h his time, and E&s;tate, to the erecting $nd Furni&s;hing a New Library for the $ublick u&s;e of the Univer&s;ity.</P>

that the Prote&s;tant's Gifts are meerly Acts of Charity to the World, and Acts of Bounty, in Reverence to Learning and learned Men, without the grand Excitement of the Health of their Souls, and of the Souls of their Fathers, to be pray'd out of Purgatory and get a ready Admi&s;&s;ion into Heaven, and the like</P>
<P>Oxford, had for many Ages the Neigh|bourhood of the Court while their Kings kept up the Royal Palace at Wood|&s;tock; which, tho' perhaps it was much di&s;continued, for the Fate of the fair Ro&s;amond, Mi&s;tre&s;s to Henry F$$z Em|pre&s;s, or Henry II. of which Hi&s;tory tells us &s;omething, and Fable much more; yet we after find that &s;everal of the Kings of England made the Hou&s;e and Park at Wood&s;tock, which was always fa$$'d for its plea&s;ant Situation, the Pl$ce of their Summer Retreat for many Years. Al&s;o for its being a Royal Palace before, even beyond the certainty of Hi&s;tory, there is abundant Rea&s;on to believe it; nay &s;ome will have it to have been a Royal Hou&s;e before Oxford was an Univer&s;ity. Dr. Plot$ allows it to have been $o ever &s;ince King Alfred; and a Manu&s;cript in the Cotton Library confirms it; and that King Henry I. was not the Founder of it&punc; but only rebuilt it: And as for Henry II. he built only &s;ome Additions; namely, that they call'd the Bower, which was a Building in the Garden (or Labyrinth,) for the Entertainment and Security of his fair Mi&s;tre&s;s&punc; of who&s;e &s;afety he was it &s;eems very careful. Notwith&s;tanding which the Queen &s;ound means to come at her, and as Fal$es report, &s;ent her out of the way by Poi&s;on.</P>
<P>The old Buildings are now no more, nor &s;o much as the Name, but the Place is the &s;ame and the natural Beauty of it indeed, is as great as ever.</P>
<P>It is &s;till a mo&s;t charming Situation, and 'tis &s;till di&s;putable after all that has been laid out, whether the Country round gives more Lu&s;tre to the Building or the Building to the Country. It has now chang'd Ma&s;ters, 'tis no more a Royal Hou&s;e or Palace for the King; but a mark of Royal Bounty to a Great, and at that time Powerful Subject, the late Duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>The Magnificence of the Building does not here as at Canons, at Cha$$worth, and at other Palaces of the Nobility, expre&s;s the Genius and the Opulence of the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or, but it repre&s;ents the Bounty, the Gratitude, or what el&s;e Po&s;terity plea&s;es to call it, of the Engli&s;h Nation&punc; to the Man whom they delighted to Honour&punc; Po&s;terity when they view in this Hou&s;e the Trophies of the Duke of Marlboroug$'s Fame, and the Glories of his great At|chievements will not celebate his Name only; but will look on Blenheim Hou&s;e, as a Monument of the generous Temper of the Engli&s;h Nation; who in &s;o glorious a manner rewarded the Services of tho&s;e who acted for them as he did: Nor can any Nation in Europe &s;hew the like Muni|ficence to any General no nor the great|e&s;t in the World; and not to go back to antient times, not the French Nation to the great Luxemberg, or the yet greater Tu$enne: Nor the Emperor to the great Eugene, or to the yet greater Duke of Lorrain; who&s;e inimitable Conduct &s;aved the Imperial City of Vienna, and re&s;cued the whole Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; retook the whole Kingdom of Hungary, and was Victorious in &s;eventeen pitched Battles. I &s;ay none of the&s;e ever received &s;o glo|rious a Mark of their Country's Favour.</P>
<P>Again, It is to be con&s;idered&punc; that not this Hou&s;e only, built at the Nation's Ex|pence, was thus given; but Lands and Pen&s;ions to the value of above one hun|dred thou&s;and Pounds Sterl&punc; and Honours the greate&s;t England can be&s;tow&punc; The&s;e are all Honours indeed to the Duke, but i$fin$$ely more to the Honour of the Na|tion</P>
<P>The Magnificent Work then is a Na|tional Building, and mu&s;t for ever be cal|led &s;o. Nay the Dimen&s;ions of it will perhaps call upon us hereafter, to own it as &s;uch in order to vindicate the Di&s;cretion of the Builder, for making a Palace too

<P>om Wood&s;tock I could not refrain $word$ a Turn a little Northward as high $$bury to the Banks of the $word$ to &s;ee the famous Spot of Ground $word$ a vigorous Rencounter happen'd $word$ the Royali&s;ts in the grand $word$ and the Parliament's Forces, $word$ William Wa$ler; I mean at $word$ Bridge, near Banbury. It was a $word$ Action, and in which the King's $word$ may be &s;aid fairly to Out-general $nemies, which really was not $word$ their Fate: I had the Plan of the before me, which I have had &s;ome and found out every &s;tep of the $word$ as it was di&s;puted on both &s;ides $word$ behaved &s;o well, that at be&s;t by Inches, where the Hor&s;e engaged and where the Foot; where Waller lo&s;t his Cannon, and where he retired; and it was evident to me the be&s;t thing Waller could do (though &s;uperiour in Number) was to retreat as he did, having lo&s;t half his Army.</P>
<P>From thence, being within eight Miles, of Edge Hill, where the fir&s;t Battle in that War happen'd&punc; I had the l k$ Plea|&s;ure of viewing the $$$und about Kein|ton, where that bloody $word$ was fought; it was evident, and one could hardly think of $word$ without regret, that the King w$th his $rmy had an infinite Ad|vantage $y bei$g $o&s;ted on the Top of the H$ll, that he knew that the Parlia|m$nt's Army were under expre&s;s Orders to $$hg$ and mu$t attack him le&s;t his Maj$&s;ty who ha$ got two Days March of them, &s;h$uld advance t$ London, where they were out of their Wits for fear of him.</P>
<P>The King I &s;ay knowing this, 'tis plain he had no Bu&s;ine&s;s but to have intrench'd, to fight upon $he Eminence where he was po&s;ted, o$ have detach'd 15000 Men for London, while he had fortify'd him|&s;elf with a &s;trong Body upon the Hill: But on the contrary, his Maje&s;ty &s;corn|ing to be pur&s;ued by his S$bjects, his Army excellently appointed, and full of Courage, not only $alt$d, but de&s;cended from his Advantages&punc; and offer'd them Battle in the pla$$ Field, which they ac|cepted.</P>
<P>Here I c$nnot but remark that this Action is perhaps the only Example in the World, of a Battle &s;o furious, &s;o ob|&s;t$nate, $anag'd with &s;uch skill, every Regiment behaving well, and doing their Du$y to the Utmo&s;t, often allying when di$order'd and indeed fighting with the Courage and Order of Veterans; and yet not one Regiment of Troops that h$d ever &s;een the Face of an Enemy, or &s;o much as b$en in Arms before. It's true, the King had rather the better of the Day; and yet the Rebel Army though their left Wing of Hor&s;e was entirely
<PB REF="268">
it might be called a drawn Battle; and the Lo&s;s on both &s;ides was &s;o equal, that it was hard to know who lo&s;t mo&s;t Men</P>
<P>But to leave the War, 'tis the Place only I am taking notice of. From hence I t$$ned South, for I was here on the Edge both $f Warwick&s;hire and Glouce&s;|ter&s;hire: But I turned South, and com+ing down by and upon the We&s;t-&s;ide of Oxford&s;hire, to Chipping Norton, we were &s;hewed Roll Ri$h$ S ones, a &s;econd Stone Henge; being a Ring of great Stones &s;tanding upright, &s;ome of them from $ to 7 $oot high.</P>
<P>I leave the D$ba$e about the Rea&s;on and Antiquity of this antient work to the Di&s;pute of the Learned, who yet can not agree about them any more t$$n $word$ Stone Henge in $word$ Camb$en will have them be a Monument of Victory, and the learned Dr Chule$on is of the &s;ame Mi$d&punc; Mr. Cambden al&s;o is willing to think that the were erected b$ Rollo the Dane, becau&s;e of the Tow$ of Rollw$ight, from which they are call'd Rolle Right or Rolle Ri$$$ Stones. Ai&s;ton wou'd have them to be a Monument of the Dead, perhaps kill'd in a B$ttle and that a great Stone 9 Foot high at a Di+&s;tance, was over a King; and 5 other great ones likewi&s;e at a Di&s;tance, were great Commanders and the like.</P>
<P>The ingenious and learned Dr Plot wou'd have us think it was a Cirque or Ri$g for their Field Elections of a King, &s;omething like the Dye$$s on Hor&s;eba$k i$ $word$ $h$t they met in the open Field to choo&s;e a King, and that the Per&s;ons in Competition were &s;everally placed in &s;uch a Cirque, &s;urrounded by the Suff ages or Voters, and that when they were Cho&s;en, the Per&s;on cho&s;en was inaugurated here.</P>
<P>Thus I leave it as I find it; for Anti|quity as I have often &s;aid is no my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s in this Work; let the Occa&s;ion of tho&s;$ Stones be what it will, they are well worth notice; e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are Curious in the &s;earch of Antiqui y.</P>

<P>In viewing this part of England, and $$ch things as the&s;e, and con&s;idering how $tle notice other Writers had taken of $em it occur'd to my thoughts that it $ou$d be a very u&s;eful and good Work, $f any curious Ob&s;erver would but write $n Account of England, and oblige him $elf to &s;peak of ruch things only, as all $odern Writers had &s;aid nothing of, or $othing but what was fal&s;e and imper|$ct.

<P>Upon the&s;e Downs we had a clear $w of the famous old Roman High|$y, call'd the Fo&s;&s;e, which evidently $&s;&s;es all the middle Part of England, $d is to be &s;een and known (tho' in no $ee plainer than here,) quite from the $h to Warwick, and thence to Leice&s;ter, Newark, to Lincoln, and on to Barton, $n the Bank of Humber.</P>
<P>Here it is &s;till the common Road, and follow'd it over the Downs to Ci|$$e&s;ter.

Thus much for Ant$$ui$y</P>
<P>There are other Roads or Fo&s;&s;es which jo$$ the Grand Highway, viz. Grinnes $$ke, from O$for$$$, Wattle Bank&punc; or Aves Dirch from $word$ and the Would Way, call'd al$o the Fo&s;&s;e cro&s;&s;ing from Glouce&s;ter to $word$</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing this way we very remark|able cro$ 'd four Rivers within the length of about 10 Miles, and enqu$ing their Names, the Country People call'd them every one the Thames which mov'd me a l$ttle to enquire the Rea&s;on, which is no more than this; namely, that the&s;e Revers which are, the Lech, the Coln, the Churn, and the I&s;is; all ri&s;ing in the Cor$wo$ld H$lls and joining together and making a full &s;tream at Lechlade near this Place, they become one River there, and are all ca$l'd Thames, or vulgarly Temms; al&s;o beg$$mag there t be Navigable, you &s;ee very large Burges at the Key, taking in Goods for London, which makes the Town of Lechlade, a very populous large Place.</P>
<P>On the Churne one of tho&s;e Rivers &s;tands Cirence&s;ter, or Ciciter for brevity, a very good Town, Populous and Rich, full of Clothiers, and driving a great Trade in Wool; which as likewi&s;e at Tetbury, is brought from the Midland Counties of Leice&s;ter, Northampton, and
<PB REF="270">
Lincoln, where the large&s;t Sheep in Eng|land are found, and where are few Manu|factures; it is &s;old here in quantities, &s;o great, that it almo&s;t exceeds belief: It is generally bought here by the Clothiers of Wilt&s;hire and Glouce&s;ter &s;hire, for the &s;upply of that great Clothing Trade; of which I have &s;poken already: They talk of 5000 Packs in a Year.</P>
<P>As we go on upon the Fo&s;&s;e, we &s;ee in the Vale on the left Hand, the a$$ieut Town of Malmsbary, famous for a Mon|a$$ary, and a great Church, bui$t out of the Ruins of it; and which I name in meer veneration to that excellent, and even be&s;t of our Old Hi&s;torians Guliel|mus Malmsburien&s;is, to whom the World is &s;o much obleg'd, for pre&s;erving the Hi&s;|tory and Antiquities of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>We next arrived at Mar&s;hifield, a Wilt|&s;hire Clothing Town, very flouri&s;hing&punc; and where we cro&s;s'd the great Road from London to Brifrol, as at Circncc&s;ter, we did that from London, to Glouce&s;ter; and in the Evening keeping &s;till the Fo&s;&s;e|way, we arrived at Bath.</P>
<P>My De&s;cription of this City would be very &s;hort, and indeed it would have been a very &s;mall City, (if at all a City) were it not for the Hot Baths here, which give both Name and Fame to the Place.</P>
<P>The Antiquity of this Place, and of the Baths here, is doubtle&s;s very great, tho' I cannot come into the In&s;cription under the Figure, &s;aid to be of a Briti&s;h King, placed in that call'd the King's Bath, which &s;ays that this King Bladud, (Mr. Cambden calls him Blayden, or Blaydon Cloyth; that is, the South &s;ayer) found out the u&s;e of the&s;e Baths, 300 Years before our Saviour's Time. I &s;ay, I cannot come into this, becau&s;e even the Di&s;covery is a&s;cribed to the Magick of the Day, not their Judgment in the Phy&s;ical Virtue of Minerals, and Mineral-waters.</P>
<P>The Antiquities of this Places are far|ther treated of by Mr. Cambden, as the Virtues of the Waters, are, by &s;everal of the Learned Members of that Faculty, who have wrote largely on that Subject; as particuly, Dr. Dr. Baynard, Dr. and others.</P>
<P>There remains little to add, but what relates to the Modern Cu&s;toms, the Gal|lantry and Diver&s;ions of that Place, $word$ which I &s;hall be very &s;hort; the be&s;t Pan being but a Barren Subject, and the wor$ Part meriting rather a Satyr, than a De|&s;cription.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved before, that i$ former Times this was a Re&s;ort hither fo$ Cripples, and the Place was truly U$ Aegrotorum Hominum: And we ice th$ Crutches hang up at the &s;everal Baths, a the Thank offerings of tho&s;e who $word$ come hither Lame, and gone away Cu$ But now we may &s;ay it is the Re&s;ort $word$ the Sound, rather than the Sick; th$ Bathing is made more a Sport and Diver|&s;ion, than a Phy&s;ical Pre&s;cription &s;o Health; and the Town is taken up $word$ Raffting, Gameing, Vi&s;iting, and in Word, all &s;orts of Gallantry and Levity.</P>
<P>The whole Time indeed is a Round $word$ the utmo&s;t Diver&s;ion. In the Morni$ you (&s;uppo&s;ing you to be a young Lad$ are fetch'd in a clo&s;e Chair, d$e&s;s'd $word$ your Bathing Cloths, that is, &s;tript to $word$ Smock, to the Cro&s;s bath. There $word$ Mu&s;ick plays you into the Bath, and $word$ Women that tend you, pre&s;ent you $word$ a little floating Wooden Di&s;h, like a $word$ in which the Lady puts a Hand$$ chief, and a No&s;egay, of late the $word$ Box is added, and &s;ome Patches; tho' $word$ Bath occa&s;ioning a little Per&s;piration, $word$ Patches do not &s;tick &s;o kindly as th$$ &s;hould,</P>
<P>Here the Ladies and the Gentleme$ pretend to keep &s;ome di&s;tance, and $word$ to their proper Side, but frequently min$ here too, as in the King and Queens $word$ tho' not &s;o often; and the Place bei$$ but narrow, they conver&s;e freely, $word$ talk, rally, make Vows, and &s;ome$$ Love; and having thus amus'd them&s;$$ an Hour, or Two, they call their Ch$ and return to their Lodgings.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Diver&s;ion here, is the Walks in the great Church, and the Raffling Shops, which are kept $word$
<PB REF="271">
Cloy&s;ter at Bartholomew Fair,) in the $rchyard, and Ground adjoyning. In Afternoon there is generally a Play, $word$ the Decorations are mean, and the $ormances accordingly; but it an&s;wers the Company here (not the Actors) $word$ the Play to &s;ay no more. In the $word$ there is a Ball, and Dancing at twice a week, which is commonly in great Town Hall, over the Market&punc;&s;e; where there never fails in the $word$ to be a great deal of very good $word$.</P>
<P>$here is is one thing very ob&s;ervable which tho' it brings abundance of $word$ to the Bath, more than ever $o be there before; yet it &s;eems to quite inverted the U&s;e and Virtue of Waters, (viz) that whereas for &s;even hundred or two thou&s;and Years, if believe King Blad$d, the Medicinal $word$ of the&s;e Waters had been u&s;eful to $i&s;ea&s;ed People by Bathing in them, they are found to be u&s;eful al&s;o, into the Body; and there are many come to drink the Waters, then to in them; nor are the Cures they $word$ this way, le&s;s valuable than the $word$ Application; e&s;pecially in $word$ ill Dige&s;tion, and Scorbutick $word$.</P>
<P>$word$ di&s;covery they &s;ay, is not yet a&punc; fifty Years old, and is &s;aid to be to the famous Dr. Ratcliff, but I $word$ it mu&s;t be older, for I have my&s;elf the Waters of the Bath above fifty ago: But be it &s;o, 'tis certain, 'tis $word$ Di&s;covery, compar'd to the U&s;e of the&s;e Waters&punc;</P>
<P>$word$ the U&s;efulne&s;s of the&s;e Waters $word$ Conception, and the known $f the late King Jame's Queen here, $word$ Monument in the Cro&s;s&punc;bath $word$ Account of it. Tho&s;e that are to give faith to &s;uch Things, may $word$ much of it at the Santa Ca&s;a of $word$ as here; and in Italy I believe it more credited.</P>
<P>$word$ is nothing in the Neighbourhood City worth notice, except it be $-Norton-Lane, where was a Fight between the Forces of King James II. and the Duke of Monmouth, in which the latter had plainly the better; and had they pu&s;h'd their Advantage, might have made it an entire Victory. On the N. W. of this City up a very &s;teep Hill, is the King's Down, where &s;ometimes Per|&s;ons of Quality who have Coaches go up for the Air: But very few People care to have Coaches here, it being a Place where they have but little room to keep them, and le&s;s to make u&s;e of them. And the Hill up to the Downs is &s;o &s;teep, that the late Queen Anne was extremely frighted in going up, her Coachman &s;topping to give the Hor&s;es Breath, and the Coach want|ing a Drag&s;taff, run back in &s;pight of all the Coachman's Skill; the Hor&s;es not being brought to &s;train the Harne&s;s again, or pull together for a good while and the Coach putting the Guards behind it into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, till &s;ome of the Servants &s;etting their Heads and Shoulders to the Wheels, &s;topt them by plain force.</P>
<P>When one is upon King Down, and has pa&s;s'd all the Steeps and Difficulties of the A&s;cent, there is a plain and plea&s;ant Country for many Miles, into Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire, and two very noble Palaces, the one built by Mr. Blathwait, late Secretary of War; and the other is call'd Badminton, the Man&s;ion of the mo&s;t noble Family of the Dukes of Beaufort, the pre&s;ent Duke being under Age. The Lu&s;tre and Mag|nificence of this Palace is magnify'd by the &s;urpri&s;e one is at, to &s;ee &s;uch a Hou&s;e in &s;uch a Retreat, &s;o difficult of Acce&s;s, at lea&s;t this way, &s;o near to &s;o much Com|pany, and yet, &s;o much alone,</P>
<P>Following the Cour&s;e of the River A|von, which runs thro' Bath, we come in Ten Miles to the City of Bri&s;tol, the greate&s;t, the riche&s;t, and the be&s;t Port of Trade in Great Britain, London only ex|cepted.</P>
<P>The Merchants of this City not only have the greate&s;t Trade, but they Trade with a more entire Independency upon London, than any other Town in Britain. And 'tis evident in this particular, (viz) That what&s;oever Exportations they make to any part of the World, they are able to
<PB REF="272">
bring the full returns back to their own Port, and can di&s;po&s;e of it there</P>
<P>This is not the Ca&s;e in any other Port in England. But they are often oblig'd either to &s;hip part of the Effects in the Ports abroad, on the &s;hips bound to London; or to con&s;ign their own &s;hips to London, in order both to get Freight, as al&s;o to di&s;po&s;e of their own Car|goes.</P>
<P>But the Bri&s;tol Merchants as they have a very great Trade abroad, &s;o they have always Buyers at Home&punc; for their Returns, and that &s;uch $uyers that no Cargo is too big for them. To this Purpo&s;e, the Shopkeepers in Bri&s;tol who in general are all Whole&s;ale Men, have &s;o great an Inland T$ade a$ong all the We&s;tern Counties, that they maintain Carriers ju&s;t as the London Trade&s;men do, to all the Principal Countries and Towns from Southampton in the South, even to the Banks of the Trent North; and tho' they have no Navigable River that way yet they drive a very great Trade through all tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>Add to that, That, as well by Sea, as by the Navigation of two great Rivers, the Wye, and the Severn. They have the whole Trade of South-Wales, as it were to them&s;elves, and the greate&s;t Part of North-Wales; and as to their Trade to Ireland, it is not only great in it &s;elf, but is prodigiou&s;ly encreas'd in the&s;e la&s;t Thirty Years, &s;ince the Revolution, not|with&s;tanding the great Encrea&s;e and En|croachment of the Merchants at Liver|pool, in the Iri&s;h Trade, and the great Deva&s;tations of the War, the Kingdom of Ireland it &s;elf being wonderfully encreas'd &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>The greatee&s;t inconveniences of Bri&s;tol, are, its &s;ituation, and the tenacious folly of its inhabitants; who by the general infatuation, the Pretence of Freedoms and and Privileges, that Corporation Tyranny, which prevents the Flouri&s;hing and E$|crea&s;e of many a good Town in Eng|land, continue ob&s;tinately to forbid any, who are not &s;ubjects of their City So|vereignty, (that is to &s;ay Freemen,) t$ Trade within the Chain of their $w$ Liberties; where it not for this, the City of Bri&s;tol, would before now, have &s;well and encreas'd in Building and inhabitants perhaps to double the Magnitude it $word$ formerly of.</P>
<P>This is evident by this one particular There is one remarkable part of the $word$ where the Liberties extend not at all, $word$ but very little without the City Gate Here and no where el&s;e, they have $word$ Acce&s;&s;ion of new Inhabitants; and abun+dance of new Hou&s;es, nay, &s;ome S$ree$ are built, and the li$e 'tis $word$ would have been at all the $e&s;t of th$ Gates, if liberty had been given. $word$ for the City it&s;elf there is hardly room to &s;et another Hou&s;e in it, 'tis $word$ clo&s;e built, except in the great Square the Ground about which is a little to &s;ubject to the hazard of Inundations So that People do not &s;o freely enlarg$ that way</P>
<P>The To$&s;ey of this City, (&s;o they $word$ their Exchange where their Merchan$$ meet,) has been a Plaee too of grea$ Bu&s;ine&s;s, yet &s;o &s;traighten d, &s;o crowd+ed, and &s;o many ways inconvenie$$ that the Merchants have been oblig$ to do le&s;s Bu&s;ine&s;s there, than $word$ the Nature of their great Trade requires They have the efore long &s;olicited, $word$ &s;ufficient Authority of Parliament, em powering them to build a Royal E$+change; by which, I mean a Place $word$ table and &s;pacious, fit for the Acco$+modation of the Merchants, and for $word$ Di&s;patch of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and to be impowere$ to pull down the adjacent Buildings $word$ that Purpo&s;e: But there is not muc$ Progre&s;s yet mad$ i$ this Work tho'$ fini&s;h'd, $word$ would add much to the Beau+ty of the City of Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>The Hot Well, or the Water of $word$ Vincent's Rock&punc; is not in the City, bu$ at the Confluence of the two little Ri+vers, and on the North S de of the Stream It is but a few Years &s;ince this Spring lay open at the Foot of the Rock, $word$
<PB REF="273">
was covered by the Salt Water at eve|ry Tide, and yet it pre&s;erved both its Warmth and its Mineral Virtue entire.</P>
<P>The Rock tho' hard to Admiration, has &s;ince that been work'd down, part|ly by &s;trength of Art, and partly blown in Pieces by Gunpowder, and a plain Foundation made for building a large Hou&s;e upon it, where they have good Apartments for entertaining di&s;ea&s;ed Per|&s;ons. The Well is &s;ecur'd, and a good Pump fix'd in it, &s;o that they have the Water pure and unmix'd from the Spring $word$ &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Water of this Well po&s;&s;e&s;s'd its Medicinal Quality no doubt from its O|riginal, which may be as ancient as the $eluge. But what is &s;trange&s;t of all is, $hat it was never known before; it is $ow famous for being a Specifick in that $therwi&s;e Incurable Di&s;ea&s;e the <HI>Diabetes;</HI> $nd yet was never known to be &s;o, till $ithin the&s;e few Years; namely, thirty Years, or thereabout.</P>
<P>There are in Bri&s;tol 21 Pari&s;h Churches, $any Meeting hou&s;es, e&s;pecially Quakers, $ne (very mean) Cathedral, the rea&s;on $f which, may be, that it is but a very $odern Bi&s;hoprick. It is &s;uppo&s;ed they $$ve an Hundred Thou&s;and Inhabitants the City, and within three Miles of $word$ Circumference; and they &s;ay above $ree Thou&s;and Sail of Ships belong to $at Port, but of the la&s;t I am not cer|$n.</P>
<P>Tis very remarkable, That this City &s;o plentifully &s;upply'd with Coals, tho' $y are all brought by Land Carriage, $t yet they are generally bought by $ Inhabitants, laid down at their Doors, $er the Rate of from Seven to Nine $llings per Chaldron.</P>
<P>The Situation of the City is low, but the &s;ide of a ri&s;ing Hill. The Ground $word$ of it is &s;aid very much to re&s;emble $word$ of Old Rome, being Circular, with $ething greater Diameter one way than $ther, but not enough to make it $word$ And the River cutting off one &s;mall part, as it were, a Sixth, or le&s;s from the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Bridge over the Avon is exceed|ing &s;trong, the Arches very high, be|cau&s;e of the Depth of Water, and the Buildings &s;o clo&s;e upon it, that in pa&s;&s;ing the Bridge, you &s;ee nothing but an en|tire well built Street. The Tide of Flood ri&s;es here near &s;ix Fathom, and runs very &s;harp.</P>
<P>They draw all their heavy Goods here on Sleds, or Sledges without Wheels, which kills a Multitude&punc; of Hor&s;es; and the Pavement is worn &s;o &s;mooth by them, that in wet weather the Streets are very &s;lippery, and in fro&s;ty weather 'tis dan|gerous.</P>
<P>From this City I re&s;olved to Coa&s;t the Mar&s;hes or Border of Wales, e&s;pecially South Wales, by tracing the Rivers Wye, and Lug, into Monmouth and Hereford|&s;hire. But I chang'd this Re&s;olution on the following Occa&s;ion; namely, the badne&s;s and danger of the Ferries over the Severn, be&s;ides, having formerly tra|vers'd the&s;e Counties, I can without a Re|vi&s;it, &s;peak of every thing that is con&s;i|derable in them, and &s;hall do it in a bet|ter by it&s;elf But in the mean time, I re&s;olv'd to follow the Cour&s;e of the fa|mous River Severn, by which I &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily &s;ee the Riche&s;t, mo&s;t Fertile, and mo&s;t agreeable part of England; the Bank of the Thames only excepted.</P>
<P>From Bri&s;tol We&s;t, you enter the County of Glouce&s;ter, and keeping the Avon in view, you &s;ee King's Road, where the Ships generally take their Departure, as ours at London do from Grave&s;end and Hung Road; where they notify their Arrival, as ours for London do in the, Downs: The one lies within the $word$ the other, in the open Sea or the Severn; which is there call'd the Severn Sea. In|deed great part of Bri&s;tol is in the Bounds of Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, tho' it be a County of it&s;elf. From hence going away a lit|tle North We&s;t, we come to the Pill, a convenient Road for Shipping, and where
<PB REF="274">
therefore they generally run back for Ireland or for Wales. There is al&s;o a little farther, an ugly, dangerous, and very in|convenient Ferry over the Severn, to the Mouth of Wye; namely, at Au&s;t; the badne&s;s of the Weather, and the &s;orry Boats, at which, deterr'd us from cro&s;&s;ing there.</P>
<P>As we turn North towards Glouce&s;ter, we lo&s;e the Sight of the Avon, and in about two Miles exchange it for an open view of the Severn Sea, which you &s;ee on the We&s;t &s;ide, and which is as broad as the Ocean there; except, that you &s;ee two &s;mall I&s;lands in it, and that looking N. W. you &s;ee plainly the Coa&s;t of South Wales; and particularly a little nearer Hand, the Shore of Monmoth&s;hire. Then as you go on, the Shores begin to draw towards one another, and the Coa&s;ts to lye Parallel; &s;o that the Severn appears to be a plain River, or an Ae&s;tuarium, &s;omewhat like the Humber, or as the Thames is at the Nore, being 4 to 5 and 6 Miles over; and to give it no more than its ju&s;t due a mo&s;t raging, turbulent, furious Place. This is occa&s;ion'd by tho&s;e violent Tides called the Bore, which &s;low here &s;ometimes &s;ix or &s;even Foot at once, rolling forward like a mighty Wave: so that the Stern of a Ve&s;&s;el &s;hall on a &s;ud|den be lifted up &s;ix or &s;even Foot upon the Water, when the Head of it is fa&s;t a Ground.</P>
<P>After Coa&s;ting the Shore about 4 Miles farther, the Road being by the low Salt Mar&s;hes, kept at a Di&s;tance from the Ri|ver: We came to the Ferry called A&s;t Ferry&punc; or more properly Au&s;t Ferry, or Au&s;t Pa&s;&s;age, from a little dirty Village called Au&s;t; near which you come to take Boat.</P>
<P>This Ferry lands you at Beachly in Monmouth&s;hire, &s;o that on the Out-&s;ide 'tis called Au&s;t-Pa&s;&s;age, and on the other Side, 'tis called Beachly-pa&s;&s;age. From whence you go by Land two little Miles to Chep&s;tow, a large Port Town on the River Wye. But of that Part I &s;hall &s;ay more in its Place.</P>
<P>When we came to Au&s;t, the hither Side of the Pa&s;&s;age, the Sea was &s;o Broad, the Fame of the Bore of the Tide &s;o formidable&punc; the Wind al&s;o made the Wa|ter &s;o rough&punc; and which was wor&s;e, the Boats to carry over both Man and Hor&s;e appeared (as I have &s;aid above) &s;o very mean, that in &s;hort none of us ca$'d to venture: So we came back, and re&s;olved to keep on the Road to Glouce&s;ter. By the Way we vi&s;ited &s;ome Friends at a Market-Town, a little out of the Road, called Chipping-Sodbury, a Place of Note for nothing that I &s;aw, but the greate&s;t Chee&s;e Market in all that Part of Eng|land; or, perhaps, any other, except Ather&s;tone, in Warwick&s;hire.</P>
<P>Hence we kept on North, pa&s;&s;ing by Dur&s;ley to Berkley-Ca&s;tle; the Antient Seat of the Earls of Berkley, a Noble tho' An|tient Building, and a very fine Park about it. The Ca&s;tle gives Title to the Earl, and the Town of Dur&s;ley to the Heir Appar|ent; who during the Life of his Father, is called the Lord Dur&s;ley. I &s;ay no|thing of the dark Story of King Edward II. of England; who, all our learned Writers agree, was murthered in this Ca&s;tle: As Richard II. was in that of Pontefract, in York&s;hire; I &s;ay I take no more notice of it here, for Hi&s;tory is not my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s: 'Tis true they &s;how the A|partments where they &s;ay that King was kept a Pri&s;oner: But they do not admit that he was killed there. The Place is rather Antient, than Plea&s;ant or Health|ful, lying low, and near the Water; but 'tis honour'd by its pre&s;ent Owner, known to the World for his many Services to his Country, and for a Fame, which our Po&s;terity will read of, in all the Hi&s;tories of our Times.</P>
<P>From hence to Glouce&s;ter, we &s;ee no|thing con&s;iderable, but a mo&s;t fertile, rich Country, and a fine River, but narrower as you go Northward, 'till a little before we come to Glouce&s;ter it cea&s;es to be Navigable by Ships of Burthen, but con|tinues to be &s;o, by large Barges, above an Hundred Miles farther; not reckoning the Turnings and Windings of the River:
<PB REF="275">
Be&s;ides that, it receives &s;everal large and Navigable Rivers into it.</P>
<P>Glouce&s;ter is an antient middling City, tolerably built, but not fine; was fortify|ed and &s;tood out ob&s;tinately again&s;t its Lord King Charles the I&s;t. who be&s;ieged it to his great lo&s;s in the late Rebellion, for which it had all its Walls and Works demoli&s;h'd; for it was then very &s;trong: Here is a large Stone Bridge over the Severn, the fir&s;t next the Sea; and this, and the Cathedral is all I &s;ee worth Re|cording of this Place. Except that the late Eminent and ju&s;tly Famous Sir Tho|mas Powel, commonly call'd Judge Powel, one of the Judges of the King's Bench Court; and Contemporary with Sir John Holt lived and dyed in this City, being one of the greate&s;t Lawyers of the Age.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is an old venerable Pile, with very little Ornament within or with|out, yet 'tis well built; and tho' plain, it $akes together, e&s;pecially the Tower, a $ery hand&s;ome Appearance. The Inha|$itants boa&s;t much of its Antiquity, and $ell us, that a Bi&s;hop and Preachers were $laced here, in the very Infancy of the $hri&s;tian Religion; namely, in the Year 89. But this I take ad referendum The $athedral they tell us, has been three mes burnt to the Ground.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Prote&s;tant Bi&s;hop of this $hurch, was, that truly Reverend and $eligious Dr. John Hooper. Set up by $ng Edward VI. and afterwards Mar|r'd for his Religion in the Marian Ty|$any: Being burnt to Death in the Ci|tary of his own Cathedral.</P>
<P>The whi&s;pering Place in this Cathedral, $word$ for many Years pa&s;s'd for a kind of $nder; but &s;ince, experience has taught the ea&s;ily comprehended Rea&s;on of the ing: And &s;ince there is now the like the Church of St. Pauls, the Wonder much abated. However, the Ver&s;es tten over this Whi&s;pering Place, inti|$e, that it has really pa&s;t for &s;ome|$g Miraculous; and as the Application $er &s;hows Religion, than Philo&s;ophy in Author, the Reader may not like $n the wor&s;e.</P>

<P>From Glouce&s;ter we kept the Ea&s;t Shor$ of the Severn, and in Twelve Miles came to Tewksbury, a Large and very Popul|ous Town &s;ituate upon the River Avon, this is call'd the Warwick&s;hire Avon, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the Avon at Bri&s;tol and others, for there are &s;everal Rivers in England of this Name; and &s;ome tell us that Avona was an old Word in the Brit|i&s;h Tongue &s;ignifying a River.</P>
<P>This Town is famous for a great Ma|nufacture of Stockings, as are al&s;o, the Towns of Per&s;hore, and Eve&s;ham, or E&s;ham; on the &s;ame River.</P>
<P>The great old Church at Tewksbury may indeed be called the large&s;t private Pari&s;h Church $n England; I mean, that is not a Collegiate or Cathedral Church. This Town is famous for the Great, and as may be &s;aid, the la&s;t Battle, fought be|tween the two Hou&s;es of Lanca&s;ter and York, in which Edward IV. was Con|queror; and in, or rather after which, Prince Edward the only &s;urviving Son of the Hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, was kill'd by the cruel Hands of Richard the King's Bro|ther; the &s;ame af erwards Richard III. or Crookback Richard. In this Place be|gins that fruitful and plentiful Country which was called the Vale of E&s;ham, which runs all along the Banks of the Avon, from Tewksbury, to Per&s;hore, and to Stratford upon Avon, and in the South Part of Warwick&s;hire; and &s;o far, (viz to Stratford,) the River Avon is navigable.</P>
<P>At this la&s;t Town, going into the Pa|ri&s;h Church, we &s;aw the Monument of old Shake&s;pear, the famous Poet, and who&s;e Dramatick performances &s;o ju&s;tly maintain his Character among the Bri|ti&s;h Poets; and perhaps will do &s;o to the End of Time. The Bu&s;to of Head is in the Wall on the North Side of the Church and a flat Grave-Stone covers the Body, in the I&s;le ju&s;t under him. On which grave-Stone the&s;e Liues are written.</P>

<P>The Navigation of this River Avon is an exceeding advantage to all this part of the Country, and al&s;o to the Commerce of the City of Bri&s;tol. For by this Ri|ver they drive a very great Trade for Sugar, Oil, Wine, Tobacco, Iron, Lead, and in a word, all heavy Goods which are carried by Water almo&s;t as far as Warwick; and return the Corn, and e&s;|pecially the Chea&s;e, is brought back from Glouce&s;ter&s;hire and Warwick&s;hire, to Bri|&s;tol.</P>
<P>This &s;ame Vale continuing to extend it &s;elf in Warwick&s;hire, and under the Ridge of little Mountains call'd Edge-Hill, is there call'd the Vale of Red-Hor&s;e. All the Grounds put together, make a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Corn Country, e&s;|pecially remarkable for the goodne&s;s of the Air, and fertility of the Soil.</P>
<P>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire mu&s;t not be pa&s;s'd over, without &s;ome account of a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fruitful Vale which cro&s;&s;es part of the Country, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t on that Side of the Cot&s;wold, and which is call'd Strood-Water; famous not for the fine&s;t Cloths only, but for dying tho&s;e Cloths of the fine&s;t Scarlets, and other Grain Colours that are any where in England; perhaps in any Part of the World: Here I &s;aw two Pieces of Broad Cloth made, one Scarlet, the other Crim&s;on in Grain, on purpo&s;e to be pre&s;ented, the one to his Maje&s;ty King George, and the other to the Prince; when the former was Elector of Hanover, and the latter, Elec|toral Prince: And it was &s;ent to Ha|nover, pre&s;ented accordingly, and very graciou&s;ly accepted. The Cloth was va|lued including the Colour, at 45 s. per Yard: Indeed it was hardly to be valued, nothing &s;o rich being ever made in Eng|land before, at lea&s;t as I was informed.</P>
<P>The Clothiers lie along the Banks of this River for near 20 Miles, and in the Town of Stroud, which lies in the mid|dle of it, as al&s;o at Payn&s;wick, which is a Market Town at a &s;mall Di&s;tance North. The River makes its way to the Severn about 5 Miles below Glouce&s;ter.</P>
<P>From Tewkesbury we went North 12 Miles, to Worce&s;ter, all the way &s;till on ths Bank of the Severn; and here we had the plea&s;ing Sight of the hedge Rows, being fill'd with Apple Trees and Pear Trees&punc; and the Fruit &s;o common, that any Pa&s;&s;enger as they travel the Road may gather and eat what they plea&s;e; and here, as well as in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, you meet with Cyder in the Publick-Hou&s;es &s;old as Beer and Ale as in the other Parts of England, and as cheap.</P>
<P>Here we &s;aw at a di&s;tance, in a mo&s;t agreeable Situation, the Man&s;ion or Seat of Sir John Packington a Baronet of a very ancient Family; and for &s;o long from Father to Son Knight of the Shire for the Country; that it &s;eems as if it were Here|ditary to that Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the Severn at&mdash;and near the Town of Bewdly the Lord Foley has a very noble Seat &s;uitable to the Grandeur of that ri&s;ing Family.</P>
<P>Worce&s;ter is a large, populous, old, tho' not a very well built City; I &s;ay not well built becau&s;e the Town is clo&s;e and old, the Hou&s;es &s;tanding too thick. The North part of the Town is more extended and al&s;o better built. There is a good old Stone Bridge over the Severn, which &s;tands exceeding high from the Surface of the Water. But as the Stream of the Severn is contracted here by the Buildings on either Side, there is evident occa&s;ion &s;ometimes for the height of the Bridge, the Waters ri&s;ing to an incredible height in the Winter Time.</P>
<P>It narrowly e&s;cap'd Burning, but did not e&s;cape Plundering at the time when the Scots Army commanded by King Charles II. in Per&s;on, was attack'd here by Cromwell's Forces; 'twas &s;aid &s;ome of the Royali&s;t's Officers them&s;elves, propos'd &s;etting the City on Fire, when
<PB REF="277">
they &s;aw it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid a $efeat, that they might the better make Retreat; which they propos'd to do $word$ the Severn, and &s;o march into $ales: But that the King, a Prince from $s Youth, of a generous and merciful $i&s;po&s;ition would by no means con&s;ent $word$ it.</P>
<P>I went to &s;e$ the Town-Hou&s;e, which forded nothing worth taking notice of, $word$ it be how much it wants to be ended with a new one; which the $word$ they &s;ay, is not &s;o much enclin'd, they are able and rich to perform. I $word$ nothing of publick notice there, but $word$ three Figures, (for they can hardly call'd Statues) of King Charles I. King $arles II. and Queen Anne</P>
<P>The Cathedral of this City is an ancient, $word$ indeed, a decay'd Building; the Body $word$ the Church is very mean in its $word$ nor did I &s;ee the lea&s;t Ornament $ut it, I mean in the out &s;ide. The $word$ is low, without any Spire, only $word$ very &s;mall Pinnacles on the Corners; $word$ yet the Tower has &s;ome little Beauty $word$ more than the Church it&s;elf too; and $word$ upper part has &s;ome Images in it, but $word$ by time.</P>
<P>$he in&s;ide of the Church has &s;everal $word$ ancient Monuments in it, $word$ &s;ome Royal ones; as that of King $word$ who lies interr'd between two $word$ Bi&s;hops, namely, St O&s;wald, and Woola&s;tan. Whether he ordered his $word$ in that Manner, believing that $word$ &s;hould help him UP at the la&s;t call, be &s;erviceable to him for his $word$ know not; it is true they &s;ay &s;o, $word$ can hardly think the King him&s;elf $word$ whether the People might $word$ tho&s;e Days of Super&s;tition; nor will $word$ but that it may be probable, they all three go together at la&s;t (as it $nd yet, without being a&s;&s;i&s;tant to, $quainted with one another at all.</P>
<P>$word$ is al&s;o a Monument for that $word$ Counte&s;s of Salisbury, who danc|$$efore, or with King Edward III $word$ great Hall at Wind&s;or, dropt her Garter, which the King taking up, ho|noured it &s;o much as to make it the de|nominating En&s;ign of his New Order of Knighthood, which is grown &s;o famous, and is call'd the Mo&s;t Noble of the Garter:</P>
<P>What honour, or that any honour re|dounds to that mo&s;t Noble Order, from its being &s;o deriv'd from the Garter of a&mdash;For 'tis generally agreed, &s;he was the King's Mi&s;tre&s;s, I will not en|quire.</P>
<P>Certainly the Order receives a ju&s;t Claim to the Title of Mo&s;t Noble, from the Honour done it, by its Royal In&s;ti|tution; and its being compos'd of &s;uch a Noble Li&s;t of the Kings and Princes as have been entred into it: I &s;ay, cer|tainly this Order has a ju&s;t Title to that of Noble, and Mo&s;t Noble too; yet I cannot but think that the King might have found out a better Trophy to have fix'd it upon, than that Lady's Garter. But this by the way: Here lies the La|dy that's certain, and a very fine Monu|ment &s;he has, in which one thing is more ridiculous than all that went be|fore, viz. That about the Monument, there are &s;everal Angels cut in Stone, &s;trewing Garters over the Tomb, as if that Pa&s;&s;age, which at be&s;t had &s;ome|thing a little Ob&s;cene in it, I mean of the Kings taking up the Lady's Garter, and giving &s;uch honours to it, was al&s;o a thing to be celebrated by Augels, <HI>in per|petuam rei memoriam.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, here is the Monument or the Body of Prince Arthur, elde&s;t Son to King Henry VII. who was married, but died &s;oon after; and his Wife Katharine Infanta of Spain, was afterwards married to, and after 20 Years Wedlock divorced from King Henry VII.</P>

<P>This City is very full of People, and the People generally e&s;teem'd very rich, being full of Bu&s;ine&s;s, occa&s;ion'd chiefly by the Cloathing Trade, of which the City and the Country round carries on a great Share, as well for the Turkey Trade as for the Home Trade:</P>
<P>The Salt Springs in this County which were formerly e&s;teem&punc;d as next to mira|culous, have &s;ince the Di&s;covery of the Mines of Rock Salt in Lanca&s;hire, Che|&s;hire, &amp;c. lo&s;t all of Wonder that belong|ed to them, and much of the U&s;e al&s;o; the Salt made there being found to be much le&s;s valuable than what is now made of the other. So I need &s;ay little to them.</P>
<P>Near this City are the famous Maul|vern Hills, or Mauvern Hills, &s;een $o far every way. In particular, we &s;aw them very plainly on the Downs, Be|tween Marlborough and Malmsbury; and they &s;ay they are &s;een from the top of Salisbury Steeple, which is above $word$ Miles.</P>
<P>There was a famous Mona&s;tery at the Foot of the&s;e Hills, on the S. W. Side, and the Ruins are &s;een to this Day; the old Legend of Wonders perform'd by the Witches of Mauvern, I &s;uppo&s;e they mean the Religiou&s;e of both kinds, are too merry, as well as too antient for this Work.</P>
<P>They talk much of Mines of Gold and Silver, which are certainly to be found here, if they were but look'd for, and that Mauvern wou'd out do Poto&s;i for Wealth; but 'tis probable if there is &s;uch Wealth, it lies too deep for this idle Ge|neration to find out, and perhaps to &s;earch for.</P>

<P>From Worce&s;ter I took a Tour into Wales, which tho' I mentioned above. it was not at the &s;ame time with the re&s;t of my Journey; my Account I hope will be as effectual.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing from this Part of the Coun|try to make a Tour through Wales, we nece&s;&s;arily &s;ee the two Counties of Here|ford and Monmouth, and for that rea&s;on $word$ re&s;erved them to this Place, a, I &s;hall the Counties of Che&s;ter and Salop to my return.</P>
<P>A little below Worce&s;ter the Severn re|ceives a River of a long Cour&s;e and deep $hanel, call'd the Teme, and going from Worce&s;ter we pa&s;t this River at a Village called Broadways; from whence keeping $word$ little to the North, we come to Ludlow Ca&s;tle, on the Bank of the &s;ame River. On another Journey I came from Stour|$ridge, famous for the Clay for melting $ots as above; thence to Kiddermin&s;ter, $nd pa&s;&s;ing the Severn at Bewdley we $ame to Ludlow, on the &s;ide of Shrop|$hire.</P>
<P>In this Cour&s;e we &s;ee two fine Seats $ot very far from the Severn, (viz) the $ord Foley's, and the Earl of Bradford's, $s we had before a mo&s;t delicious Hou&s;e, $elonging to the Lord Conway, now in $he Family of the late Famous Sir Ed|ward Seymour. Indeed this Part of the $ounty, and all the County of Salop is $word$ with &s;ine Seats of the Nob$lity and $eatry, too many &s;o much as to give a $i&s;t of, and much le&s;s to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle of Ludlow &s;hows in its De|$y, what it was in its flouri&s;hing E&s;tate: $word$ is the Palace of the Princes of Wales, $word$ is, to &s;peak more properly, it is an $word$ to the Principality of Wales; which $word$ the Appenage of the Heir Apparent, $nd this is his Palace in right of his be|$$g made Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>The Situation of this Ca&s;tle is mo&s;t $eautiful indeed; there is a mo&s;t &s;pacious $word$ or Lawn in its Front, which former|$$ continu'd near two Miles; but much $word$ it is now enclo&s;ed. The Country round it is exceeding plea&s;ant, fertile, popnlous, and the Soil rich; nothing can be added by Nature to make it a Place fit for a Royal Palace: It only wants the Re&s;idence of its Princes, but that is not now to be expected.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle it&s;elf is in the very Per|fection of Decay, all the fine Courts, the Royal Apartments, Halls, and Rooms of State, lye open, abandoned and &s;ome of them falling down; for &s;ince the Courts of the Pre&s;ident and Marches are taken away, here is nothing to do that requires the Attendance of any publick People; &s;o that Time, the great Devourer of the Works of Men, begins to eat into the very Stone Walls, and to &s;pread the Face of Royal Ruins upon the whole Fabrick.</P>
<P>The Town of Ludlow is a tolerable Place, but it decays to be &s;ure with the re&s;t, It &s;tands on the Edge of the two Countries, Shrop&s;hire, and Worce&s;ter&s;hire, but is it&s;elf in the fir&s;t; 'tis on the Bank of the Teme, over which it has a good Bridge, and it was formerly a Town of good Trade; the Weleh call this Town Lye Twy&s;oe, which is in Engli&s;h, the Prince's Court. Mr. Cambden calls, the River Teme the Tem'd, and another River which joyns it ju&s;t at this Town, the Corve, whence the rich flat Country below the Town is call'd Corve&s;dal$.</P>
<P>King Henry VIII. E&s;tabli&s;hed the Court of the Pre&s;ident here, and the Council of the Marches and all Cau$es of ni&s;i prius, or of Civil Right were try'd here, be|fore the Lord Pre&s;ident and Council; but this Court was entirely taken away by Act of Parliament in our Days, and this, as above tends to the &s;en&s;ible Decay of the Town as well as of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>From Ludlow we took our Cour&s;e due South to Lem&s;ter, or Leomin&s;ter, a large and good trading Town on the River Lug&punc; This River is lately made Navigable by act of Parliament, to the very great Pro|fit of the trading Part of this Country, who have now a very gre$t $word$ for their Corn, Wool, and oth$$ $span$ this Place, into the River Wye&punc; $span$ the Wye, into the Severn, and $span$</P>
<P><PB REF="282">
Leomin&s;ter has nothing very remark|able in it, but that it is a well built, well inhabited Town: The Church which is very large, has been in a manner Re|built, and is now, e&s;pecially in the in|&s;ide a very beautiful Church; This Town, be&s;ides the fine Wool, is noted for the be&s;t Wheat, and con&s;equently the fine&s;t Bread; whence Lem&s;ter Bread, and Weobly Ale, is become a proverbial &s;aying.</P>
<P>The County on our right as we came from Ludlow is very fruitful and plea|&s;ant, and is call'd the Hundred of Wig|more, from which the late Earl of Oxford at his Creation, took the Title of Baron of Wigmore: And here we &s;aw two an|cient Ca&s;tles, viz Brampton Brian, and and Wigmore Ca&s;tle, both belonging to the Earl's Father, Sir Edward Harley: Brampton is a $$arely Pile, but not kept in full repair, the fate of that ancient Fa|mily not permitting the Rebuilding it as we were told was intended Yet it is not &s;o far decay'd as Ludlow, nor is it abandoned, or like to be &s;o, and the Parks are &s;till very fine, and full of large Timber.</P>
<P>We were now on the Borders of Wales, properly &s;o call'd; for from the windows of Brampton Ca&s;tle, you have a fair Pro&s;|pect into the County of Radnor, which is, as it were, under its walls; nay, even this whole County of Heref rd, was, if may believe Antiquity, a part of Wales, and was &s;o e&s;teem'd for many Ages. The People of this County too, boa&s;t that they were a part of the ancient Silures, who for &s;o many Ages with&s;tood the Ro|man Arms, and who could never be en|tirely conquer'd. I ob&s;erv'd they are a diligent and laborious People, chiefly ad|dicted to Husbandry, and they boa&s;t, perhaps, not without rea&s;on, that they have the fine&s;t Wool, the be&s;t Hops, and the riche&s;t Cyder in all Britain.</P>
<P>Indeed the Wool about Leomin&s;ter, and in the Hundred of Wigmore ob&s;erv'd a|bove, and the Golden Vale as 'tis call'd for its richne&s;s on the Banks of the River Dove, (all in this County) is the fine&s;t without Reception, of any in England, the South Down Wool not excepted: As for Hops, they plant abundance indeed all over this County, and they are very good. And as for Cyder, here it was that &s;everal times for 20 Miles together, we cou d get no Beer or Ale in their Publick Hou&s;es, only Cyder; and that &s;o very good, &s;o fine, and &s;o cheap, that we never found fault with the exchange; great quan|tities of this Cyder are &s;ent to London $word$ by Land Carriage tho' &s;o very $word$ $e mo$e, which is an Evidence for the Good u&s;es of it, beyond contradiction.</P>
<P>One would hardly expect &s;o plea&s;an$ and fruitfull a Country as this, &s;o $word$ the Barren Mountains of Wales, but $word$ certain, that not any of our Southe$ the neighbourhood of London except$ comes up to the Fertility of this Count As Glouce&s;ter furni&s;hes London $word$ great Quantities of Chee&s;e, &s;o this $word$ furni&s;hes the &s;ame City with $word$ in great Quantities, and al&s;o with $word$ as above.</P>
<P>From Lem&s;ter it is 10 Miles to $word$ the chief City, not of this $word$ only, but of all the Counties we&s;t Severn: 'Tis a large and a populous $word$ and in the time of the late Rebelli$$ was very &s;trong, and being well $word$ and as well defended, &s;upporte$ tedious and very &s;iege; for be&s;ides Parliament Forces, who could never duce it, the Scots Army was call'd the work, who lay before it, till $word$ laid above 4000 of their Bones $word$ and at la&s;t, it was rather taken by Fate of the war, than by the Attack of Be&s;iegers&punc;</P>
<P>Coming to Hereford, we could but enquire into the truth of the $word$ &s;o famous, that the Reverend Dr. $word$ has mentioned it in his Continu$ of Cambden; of the removing the great Stones near Sutton, which People confirm'd to us. The $word$ thus:</P>

<P>From Hereford keeping the Bank of Wye as near as we could, we came to Ro&s;s, a good old Town, famous for good Cyder, a great Manufacture of Iron Ware, and a good Trade on the River Wye&punc; and nothing el&s;e as I remember, except it was a mon&s;trous fat Woman, who they would have had me gone to &s;ee But I had enough of the Relation, and &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e will the Reader, for they told me &s;he was more than three Yards about her Wai&s;t; that when &s;he &s;at down, &s;he was oblig'd to have a &s;mall Stool plac'd before her, to re&s;t her Belly on, and the like.</P>
<P>From hence we came at about 8 Miles more into Monmouth&s;hire, and to the Town of Monmouth. It is an old Town &s;ituate at the Conflux of the Wye and of Munnow, whence the Town has its Name; it &s;tands in the Angle where the Rivers join, and has a Bridge over each River, and a third over the River Tro|thy, which comes in ju&s;t below the other.</P>
<P>This Town &s;hews by its Reverend Face, that it is a Place of great Anti|quity, and by the remains of Walls, Lines, Curtains, and Ba&s;tions, that it has been very &s;trong, and by its &s;ituation that it may be made &s;o again: This Place is made famous, by being the Native Place

of one of our mo&s;t antient Hi&s;torians Jeoffry of Monmouth. At pre&s;ent 'tis rather a decay'd than a flouri&s;hing Town, yet, it drives a con&s;iderable Trade with the City of Bri&s;tol, by the Navigation of the Wye.</P>

<P>This County furni&s;hes great Quantities of Corn for Exportation, and the Bri&s;tol Merchants frequently loaded Ships here, to go to Portugal, and other Foreign Coun|tries with Wheat; con&s;idering the Moun|tainous Part of the We&s;t of this County, 'tis much they &s;hould have &s;uch good Corn, and &s;o much of it to &s;pare; but the Ea&s;tern Side of the County, and the Neighbour|hood of Hereford&s;hire, &s;upplies them.</P>

<P>The two fir&s;t Counties which bord$ We&s;t upon Monmouth&s;hire, are Brecknock and Glamorgan, and as they are very Mountainous, &s;o that Part of Monmouth+&s;hire which joyns them, begins the ri&s;ing of the Hills. Kyrton-Beacon, Tumber low, Blorench, Penvail, and Shirridan are &s;ome of the Names of the&s;e horrid Mountains, and are all in this Shire; and I could not but fan$y my&s;elf in view o$ Mount Brennus, Little Barnard, and Great Barnard, among the Alps. When I &s;aw Plinlimmon Hill, and the Sources of the Severn on one Side of it, and the Wy$ and Rydall on the other: It put me in mind of the famous Hill, call'd in the Cantons of Switzerland, out o$ which the Rhine ri&s;es on one &s;ide, and the Rho&s;ne, and the Aa on the other&punc; But I &s;hall give you more of them pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>We now entered South Wales: The Provinces which bear the Name of Sout$ Wales, are the&s;e Glamorgan, Breckno$$&punc; Radnor, Caermarthen, Pembroke, and Cardigan. We begin with Brecknock being willing to &s;ee the highe&s;t of the Mountains, which are &s;aid to be her$$+bouts; and indeed, except I had &s;till $word$ Idea of the height of the Alps, and $word$ tho&s;e mighty Mountains of America, $word$ Andes, which we &s;ee very often in $word$ South-&s;eas, 20 Leagues from the Shore$ I &s;ay, except that I had &s;till an Idea o$ tho&s;e Countries on my Mind. I &s;ho$$ have been &s;urprized at the &s;ight of the$ Hills; nay, (as it was) the Andes an$ the Alps, tho' immen&s;ly high, yet the$ &s;tand together, and they are as Mountain$ pil'd upon Mountains, and Hills up$$ Hills; whereas &s;ometimes we &s;ee th$$ Mountains ri&s;ing up at once, from th$ lowe&s;t Valleys, to the highe&s;t Summi$ which makes the height look horrid $word$ frightful, eve$ wor&s;e than tho&s;e Mo$$|tains abroad; which tho' much high$$

ri&s;e as it were, one behind another; So that the A&s;cent &s;eems gradual, and con|&s;equently le&s;s &s;urprizing.</P>
<P>Brecknock&s;hire is a meer Inland County, as Radnor is; the Engli&s;h je&s;tingly (and I think not very improperly) call it Break|neck&s;hire: 'Tis Mountainous to an Ec|tremity, except on the &s;ide of Radnor, where it is &s;omething more low and level. It is well watered by the Wye, and the Uske, two Rivers mentioned before; up|on the latter &s;tands the Town of Breck|nock, the Capital of the County: The mo&s;t to be &s;aid of this Town, is what indeed I have &s;aid of many Places, in Wales. (viz. that it is very antient, and indeed to mention it here for all the re&s;t, there are more Tokens of Antiquity to be &s;een every where in Wales&punc; than in any particular Part of England, except the Counties of Cumberland, and Nor|thumberland. Here we &s;aw Brecknock-Mere, a large or long Lake of Water, two or three Miles over; of which, they have a great many Welch Fables, not worth relating: The be&s;t of them is, that a cer|tain River call'd the Lheweni runs thro' it, and keeps its Colour in Mid chanel di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Water of the Lake, and as they &s;ay, never mingles with it. They take abundance of good Fi&s;h in this Lake, &s;o that as is &s;aid of the River Thy&s;&s;e in Hungary; they &s;ay this Lake is two thirds Water, and one third Fi&s;h. The Country People affirm, there &s;tood a City once here, but, that by the Judg|ment of Heaven, for the Sin of iis In|habitants, it &s;unk into the Earth, and the Water ro&s;e up in the Place of it. I ob ob&s;erve the &s;ame Story is mentioned by Mr. Cambden with &s;ome difference in the particulars: I believe my &s;hare of it, but 'tis remarkable, that Mr Cambden having lo&s;t the old City Loventium, mentioned by Ptolomy to be hereabouts, is willing to account for it, by this old Story</P>
<P>It was among the Mountains of this County that the famous Glendower &s;hel|$er'd him&s;elf, and taking Arms on the depo&s;ing Richad II. Proclaimed him&s;elf Prince of Wales; and they &s;hew us &s;e|veral little Refuges of his in the Moun|tains, whither he retreated; and fro whence, again, he made &s;uch bold Ex+cur&s;ions into England.</P>
<P>Tho' this County be &s;o Mountainou Provi&s;ions are exceeding Plentiful, an al&s;o very good all over the County; no$ are the&s;e Mountains u&s;ele&s;s, even to the City of London, as I have noted of o+ther Counties; for from hence they &s;en$ yearly, great Herds of Black Cattle t$ England, and which are known to fill ou$ Fairs and Markets, even that of Smith field it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The yellow Mountains of Radnor&s;hir&punc; are the &s;ame, and their Product of Cattl$ is the &s;ame; nor did I meet with any thing new, and worth noticing, excep Monuments of Antiquity, which are no the Subject of my Enquiry: The Stories of Vortigern, and Roger of Mortimer, are in every old Woman's Mouth here. There is here a great Cataract or Water Fall o$ the River Wye, at a Place call'd Rhajad$ Gwy in Welch, which &s;ignifies the Cata|ract or Water Fall of the Wye, but we did not go to &s;ee it, by rea&s;on of a great Flood at that time, which made the Way dangerous: There is a kind of De&s;art too on that &s;ide, which is &s;carce habitable o$ pa&s;&s;able, &s;o we made it our North Boun+dary for this Part of our Journey, an turn'd away to Glamorgan&s;hire.</P>
<P>Entring this Shire, from Radnor an Brecknock, we were &s;aluted with Monuc$|denny-Hill on our left, and the Black Mountain on the right, and all a Ridg of horrid Rocks and Precipices betwee$ over which, if we had not had tru&s;t Guides, we &s;hould never have found o$ Way; and indeed, we began to reper our Curio&s;ity, as not having met with an thing worth the trouble; and a Countr$ looking &s;o full of horror, that w thought to have given over the Enterpri&s;$ and have left Wales out of our Circnit But after a Day and a Night conver&s;io$ thus with Rocks and Mountains, $word$ Guide brought us down into a mo&s;t agre$+able Vale, opening to the South, and plea&s;ant River running through it, call'$
<PB REF="286">
the Taaffe; and following the Cour&s;e of this River, we came in the Evening to the ancient City of Landaff, and Caer|diff, &s;tanding almo&s;t together.</P>
<P>Landaff is the &s;eat of the Epi&s;copal See, and a City; but Cardiff which is lower on the River, is the Port and Town of Trade; and has a very good Harbour opening into the Severn Sea, about 4 Miles below the Town. The Cathedral is a neat Building, but very Ancient; they boa&s;t that this Church was a Hou&s;e of Religious wor&s;hip ma|ny Years before any Church was founded in England, and that the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion flouri&s;h'd here in its Primitive Pu|rity, from the Year 186, till the Pela|gi$n Here&s;y over&s;pread this country; which being afterwards rooted out by the care of the Orthodox Bi&s;hop, they plac'd St. Dobricius as the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop in this Town of Landaff, then call'd Taunton: 'Tis ob&s;ervable, that though the Bi&s;hop of Landaff was call'd an Arch-Bi&s;hop, yet the Cathedral Church was but 28 Foot long, and 10 Foot broad, and without any Steeple or Bells; notwith|&s;tanding which the 3 fir&s;t Bi&s;hops were afterwards Sainted, for their eminent Ho|line&s;s of Life, and the Miracles they wrought; nor had they any other Ca|thedral from the year 386, to the year 1107, when Bi&s;hop Urban built the pre|&s;ent Church, with &s;ome Hou&s;es for the Clergy adjoining, in the Nature of a Cloy&s;ter.</P>
<P>Tho' the Church is ancient, yet the Building is good, and the Choir neat, and pretty well kept; but there are no Monuments of Note in it, except &s;ome &s;o Ancient, that no In&s;cription can be read, to give any account of.</P>
<P>The South Part of this country is a plea&s;ant and agreeable Place, and is very Populous; 'tis al&s;o a very good, fertile, and rich Soil, and the low Grounds are &s;o well cover'd with Gra&s;s, and &s;tock'd with Cattle&punc; that they &s;upply the City of Bri&s;tol with Butter in very great quanti|ties &s;alted and barrell'd up, ju&s;t as Suffolk does the City of London.</P>
<P>The chief Sea Port is Swanzey, a ve|ry con&s;iderable Town for Trade, and has a very good Harbour: Here is al&s;o a very great Trade for Coals and Culmn, which they Export to all the Ports of Somer&s;et, Devon, and Cornwall, and al|&s;o to Ireland it&s;elf; &s;o that one &s;ome|times fees a hundred &s;ail of Ships at a time loading Coals here; which greatly enriches the country, and particularly this Town of Swanvey, which is really a very thriving Place; it &s;tands on the River Tawye, or Taw: 'Tis very re|markable, that mo&s;t of the Rivers in this County chime upon the Letters <HI>T,</HI> and <HI>Y,</HI> as <HI>Taaf, Tawy, Tay, Towy, Tyevy.</HI></P>
<P>Neath is another P$rt, where the Coal Trade is al&s;o con&s;iderable, tho' it &s;tands farther within the Land. Kynfig Ca&s;tle, is now the Seat and E&s;tate of the Lord Man&s;el, who has here al&s;o a very Royal income from the Colleries: I &s;ay Royal, becau&s;e equal to the Revenues of &s;ome Soverein Princes, and which formerly de|nominated Sir Edward Man&s;el, one of the riche&s;t Commoners in Wales, the Fa|mily was enobled by her late Maje&s;ty Q. ANNE.</P>
<P>In this Neighbourhood, near Margan Mynydd, we &s;aw the famous Monument mentioned by Mr Cambden, on a Hill, with the in&s;cription, which the People are &s;o terrify'd at, that no body will care to read it; for they have a tradi|tion from Father to Son, that whoever ventures to read it, will die within a Month. We did not &s;cruple the Adven|ture at all, but when we came to try, the Letters were &s;o defac'd by time, that we were effectually &s;ecur'd from the Dan|ger; the in&s;cription not being any thing near &s;o legible, as it &s;eems it was in Camb|den's time.</P>
<P>The Stone Pillar is about 4 or 5 Foot high, and 1 Poot thick, &s;tanding on the top of this Hill; there are &s;eve|veral other &s;uch Monuments in Rad|nor&s;hire, and other Counties in Wales, as likewi&s;e in Scotland we &s;aw the like: But as I have always &s;aid, I carefully avoid entering into any Di&s;cour&s;es of
<PB REF="287">
any thing of Antiquity, as what the narrow compa&s;s of the&s;e Letters will not allow.</P>
<P>Having thus touch'd at what is mo&s;t Curious on this Coa&s;t, we pa&s;s'd thro' the Land of Gowre, and going &s;till We&s;t, we came to Caermarthen, or Kaer-Vyrh|hin, as the Wel&s;h call it, the Capital of the County of Kaermardhin&s;hire.</P>
<P>This is an ancient but not a decay'd Town, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the River Towy, or Tovy, which is Navigable up to the Town, for Ve&s;&s;els of a moderate Burthen. The Town indeed is well Built, and Populous, and the Country round it, is the mo&s;t fruitfull of any part of all Wales, con&s;idering that it continues to be $o for a great way, namely, thro' all the middle of the County, amd a great way $nto the next; nor is this County &s;o Mountainous and Wild, as the re&s;t of $his Part of Wales; But it abounds in Coin, and in fine flouri&s;hing Meadows, $s good as mo&s;t are in Britain, and in which are fed, a very great Number of $ood Cattle.</P>
<P>The Chancery, and Fxchequer of the $rincipality, was u&s;ually kept at this $own, till the Juri&s;diction of the Court $$d Matches of Wal s was taken away. $his Town was al&s;o famous for the $rth of the old Briti&s;h Prophet MERLIN, $word$ whom &s;o many things are &s;abled, that $de$d nothing of its kind ever prevail'd $word$ far, in the Delu&s;ion of Markind, and $$o flouri&s;h'd in the Year 48$: And here $o the old Britains often kept their $rliament or A&s;&s;emblies of their Wi&s;e $$n, and made their $ aws The Town $s fortify'd in former times, but the $alls are &s;carcely to be &s;een now, only $word$ Ruins of them</P>
<P>Here we &s;aw near Kily Maen Ibwyd, $word$ a great Mountain a Circle of mighty $nes, very much like Stone henge in $$$$hire, or rather like the Rollry$h $n$s in Oxford&s;hire; and tho' the P$o|$ call it Bru$rth Arthur, or King Ar|$$, or King Arthur's Throne. We &s;ee $word$ rea&s;on to believe that King Arthur knew any thing of it, or that it had any relation to him.</P>
<P>We found the People of this County more civiliz'd and more courteous, than in the more Mountainous Parts, where the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Inhabitans &s;eems to be rough, like the Country: But here as they &s;eem to conver&s;e with the re&s;t of the World, by their Commerce, &s;o they are more conver&s;iue than their Neighbours.</P>
<P>The next County We&s;t, is Pembroke|&s;hire, which is the mo&s;t extreme Part of Wales on this &s;ide, in a rich, fertile, and plentiful Country, lying on the Sea Coa&s;t, where it has the Benefit of Milford Ha|ven, one of the greate&s;t and $e&s;t inlets of Water in Britain Mr. Cambden &s;ays it contains 16 Creeks&punc; 5 great Bays, and 13 good Road, for Shipping, all di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd as &s;uch by their Names; and &s;ome &s;ay, a thou&s;and Sail of Ships may ride in it, and not the Top Ma&s;t of one be &s;een from another; but this la&s;t, I think, merits Confirmation.</P>
<P>Before we quirted the Coa&s;t, we &s;aw Tenbigh, the mo&s;t agreeable Town on all the Sea Coa&s;t of South Wales, ex|cept Pembroke, being a very good Road for Shipping, and well frequented: Here is a great Fi&s;hery for Herring in its Sea|&s;on, a great Colliery, or rather export of Coals, and they al&s;o drive a very con&s;i|derable Trade to Ireland.</P>
<P>From hence, the Land bearing far into the Sea, makes a Promontory, call'd St. Goven's Head or Point. But as we found nothing of moment was to be &s;een there, we cro&s;s'd over the I&s;thmus to Pembroke, which &s;tands on the Ea&s;t Shore of the great Haven of Milford.</P>
<P>This is the large&s;t and riche&s;t, and at this Time, the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Town of all South Wales: Here are a great ma|ny Engli&s;h Merchants, and &s;ome of them Men of good Bu&s;ine&s;s; and they told us, there were near 2$ &s;ail of &s;hips belong'd to the Town, &s;mall and great, in a Word, all this Part of Wales is a rich and flouri&s;h|ing County, but e&s;pecially th s Part is &s;o
<PB REF="288">
veay plea&s;ant, and fertile, and is &s;o well cultivated, that 'tis called by Di&s;tinction, Little England, beyond Wales.</P>
<P>This is the Place al&s;o made particular|ly famous for the Landing of King Henry VII, then Duke of Richmond: From hence, being re&s;olv'd to &s;ee the utmo&s;t Extent of the County We&s;t, we ferry'd over the Haven as $span$ and went to Haverford, or by &s;ome call'd Haverford-We&s;t; and from thence to St. Davids, or St. Taffys, as the Welch call it. Haver|ford is a better Town than we expected to find, in this remote Angle of Britain; 'tis Strong, well Built, Clean, and Po|pulous.</P>
<P>From hence to St. Davids, the Country begins to look like Wales again, Dry, Barren, and Mountainous; St. Davids is not a Bi&s;hop's See only, but was former|ly an Arch Bi&s;hop's, which they tell us, was by the Pope transferr'd to Dole in Britany, were it &s;till remains.</P>
<P>The venerable A&s;pect of this Cathedral Church, &s;hews that it has been a beauti|ful Building, but that it is much decayed. The We&s;t End or Body of the Church is tolerably well; the Choir is kept neat, and in tollerable repair, the S. I&s;le with|out the Choir, and the Virgin Mary's Chappel, which makes the E. End of the Church, are in a manner demoli&s;h'd, and the Roofs of both fallen in.</P>
<P>There are a great many eminent Per|&s;ons bury'd here, be&s;ides &s;uch, who&s;e Monuments are defaced by Time, There is St. Davids Monument, to whom the Church is Dedicated, the Monument of the Earl of Richmond, as al&s;o of the fa|mous Owen Tudor; there are al&s;o four antient Monuments of Knights Templars, known by their Figures lying cro&s;s Legg'd; but their Names are not known, and there are &s;ix &s;everal Monuments of Bi&s;hops, who ruled this Church, be&s;ides St. David.</P>
<P>This St. David they tell us was Uncle to King Arthur, that he lived to 146 Years of Age, that he was Bi&s;hop of this Church 65 Years, being born in the Year 496, and dyed Ann. 642; that he built 12 Mona&s;taries, and did abundance of Miracles.</P>
<P>There was a very hand&s;ome Hou&s;e for the Bi&s;hop, with a College, all built in a Clo&s;e by them&s;elves, but they are now turn'd to Ruins.</P>
<P>Here the Weather being very Clear, we had a full View of Ireland, tho' at a very great Di&s;tance: The Land here is call'd St. Davids Head, and from hence, there has &s;ome time ago, gone a Pa&s;&s;age Boat con&s;tantly between England and Ireland, but that Voitu$e is at pre&s;ent di&s;countinu|ed. The reckon np 112 Bi&s;hops of this See, &s;ince it begun, 10 the Year 1712.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Bi&s;hop but two, was Dr. Tho. Wat&s;on, of whom the World has heard &s;o much, being depriv'd after a long De|bate, on a Charge of Simony; whether ju&s;tly, or not, I &s;hall not enquire, but he be&s;tow'd great Sums on Charitable De|&s;igns, and is &s;till (living) enclined as I am told, to do much more.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd N. keeping the Sea in our W. Pro&s;pect, and a rugged Mountainous Country on the E. where the Hills even darken'd the Air with their Heighth; as we went on, we pa&s;t by Newport, on the River Nevern, a Town having a good Harbour, and con&s;equently a good Trade with Ireland.</P>
<P>Here we left Pembroke&s;hire, and after about 22 Miles, came to the Town of Cardigan, an old and well Inhabited Town, on the River Tivy: 'Tis a very noble River indeed, and famous for its plenty of the be&s;t and large&s;t Salmon in Britain.</P>
<P>The Country People told us, that they had Beavers here, which bred in the Lakes among the Mountains, and came down the Stream of Tivy to &s;eed; that they de|&s;troy'd the young Frye of Salmon, and therefore the Country People de&s;troyed them; but they could &s;hew us none of them, or any of their Skins, neither could the Countrymen de&s;cribe them, or tell us that they had ever &s;een them; &s;o that we concluded they only meant the Otter, till I found after our return, that Mr.
<PB REF="289">
Cambden mentions al&s;o, that there were $eavers &s;een here formerly.</P>
<P>This Town of Cardigan was once po&s;|$&s;s'd by the great Rober Fitl-Stephen, $ho was the fir&s;t Britain that ever at|$$mpted the Conque&s;t of Ireland; and $$d &s;uch Succe&s;s with a handful of Men, $word$ afterwards gave the Engli&s;h a footing $ere, which they never quitted after|wards, till they quite reduc'd the Coun|$y, and made it, as it were, a Province of England.</P>
<P>The Town is not large, has been well $rtify'd, but that Part is now wholly $eglected. It has a good Trade with Ire|$nd and is enrich'd very much, as is all $is Part of the Country, by the famous $ead Mines, formerly di&s;covered by Sir $arbery Price, which are the greate&s;t, and $erhaps the riche&s;t in England; and par|$ularly as they require &s;o little Labour $d Charge to come at the Oar, which in any Places lyes within a Fathom or two $word$ the Surface, and in &s;ome, even bare $word$ the very top.</P>
<P>Going N. from the Tivy about 25 $iles, we came to Abryftwyth, that is &s;ay, the Town at the Mouth of the $ver Yyftwyth. This Town is enrich'd $ the Coals and Lead which is found in Neighbourhood, and is a populous, $t a very dirty, black, &s;moaky Place, $d we fancy'd the People look'd as if $y liv'd continually in the Coal or Lead $nes. However, they are Rich, and $word$ Place is very Populous.</P>
<P>The whole County of Cardigan is &s;o $word$ of Cattle, that 'tis &s;aid to be the Nur|$y or Breeding-Place for the whole $gdom of England, S. by Trent; but $word$ is not a Proof of its Fertility, for $word$ the feeding of Cattle indeed requires $ich Soil, the breeding them does not, $word$ Mountains and Moors being as proper that purpo&s;e as richer Land.</P>
<P>Now we entered N. Wales, only I uld add, that as we pa&s;s'd, we had a $t of the famous Plymlymon-Hill, out the Ea&s;t Side of which as I mentioned $re, ri&s;es the Severn, and the Wye; $word$ out of the We&s;t Side of it, ri&s;es the Rydall and the Yyftwyth. This Moun|tain is exceeding high, and tho' it is hard to &s;ay which is the highe&s;t Hill in Wales, yet I think this bids fair for it; nor is the County for 20 Miles round it, any thing but a continued ridge of Mountains: So that for almo&s;t a whole Weeks Travel, we &s;eemed to be conver&s;ing with the up|pet Regions; for we were often above the Clouds, I'm &s;ure, a very great way, and the Names of &s;ome of the&s;e Hills &s;eem'd as barbarous to us, who &s;poke no Welch, as the Hills them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e Mountains, I &s;ay we en|tered N. Wales, which contains the Coun|ties of Montgomery, Merionith, Caer|narvon, Denbeigh, and Flint Shires, and the I&s;le of Angle&s;ea.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing Montgomery &s;hire, we were &s;o tired with Rocks and Mountains, that we wi&s;hed heartily we had kept clo&s;e to the Sea Shore, but it not much mended the Matter if we had, as I under&s;tood afterwards: The River Severn is the only Beauty of this County, which ri&s;ing I &s;ay, out of the Plymlymon Mountain, receives in&s;tantly &s;o many other Rivers into its Bo&s;om, that it becomes Navigable before it gets out of the County; namely, at Welch Pool, on the Edge of Shrop|&s;hire. This is a good fa&s;hionable Place, and has many Engli&s;h Dwelling in it, and &s;ome very good Families; but we &s;aw no|thing farther worth remarking.</P>
<P>The Vales and Meadows upon the Bank of the Severn, are the be&s;t of this County, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, the only good part of it; &s;ome are of opinion, that, the very Water of the Severn, like that of Nile, impregnates the Valleys, and when it overflows, leaves a Vertue behind it, par|ticularly to it&s;elf; and this they &s;ay is confirmed, becau&s;e all the Country is &s;o fruitful wherever this River does over|flow, and its Waters reach. The Town, or rather as the Natives call it, the City of Montgomery, lies not far from this River, on the outer edge of the Coun|try next to Hereford&s;hire. This was, it &s;eems, a great Frontier Town iu the wars between the Engli&s;h and the Welch,
<PB REF="290">
and was beautify'd and fortify'd by King Henry III; the Town is now much de|cay'd: It gives title to the elde&s;t &s;on of the Ducal Hou&s;e of Powis, who is call'd Lord Montgomery, and Marquis of Powis; they have a noble Seat at Troy, hard by this town on the other &s;ide the River: But the Hou&s;e of Pembroke al&s;o claims the title of Montgomery.</P>
<P>This County is noted for an excellent breed of Welch Hor&s;es, which, though not very large, are exceeding valuable, and much e&s;teem'd all over England; all the North and We&s;t part of the County is mountainous and &s;tony. We &s;aw a great many old monuments in this coun|try, and Roman camps wherever we came, and e&s;pecially if we met any Per+&s;on curious in &s;uch things, we found they had many Roman coins; but this was none of my enquiry, as I have &s;aid already.</P>
<P>Merionith&s;hite, or Merionyd&s;hire, lies We&s;t from Montgomery&s;hire; it lies on the Iri&s;h Sea, or rather the Ocean; for St. George's channel does not begin till further North, and it is extended on the coa&s;t, for near 35 miles in length, all &s;till mountainous and craggy. The principal River is the Tovy, which ri&s;es among the unpa&s;&s;able mountains, which range along the center of this part of Wales, and which we call unpa&s;&s;able, for that even the People them&s;elves call'd them &s;o; we look'd at them indeed with A&s;ton|i&s;hment, for their rugged Tops, and the immen&s;e Height of them: Some parti|cular Hills have particular Names, but otherwi&s;e we called them all them all the black mountains, and they well de|&s;erv'd the Name; &s;ome think 'tis from the unpa&s;&s;able mountains of this Coun|ty, that we have an old &s;aying, that the Devil lives in the middle of Wales, tho' I know there is another meaning given to it; in a word, Mr. Cambden calls the&s;e Parts the Alps of Wales.</P>
<P>There is but few large Towns in all this Part, nor is it very Populous; in|deed much of it is &s;carce Habitable, but 'tis &s;aid, there are more Sheep in it, in all the re&s;t of Wales. On the Sea Shore however, we &s;ee Harleigh Ca&s;tle, which is &s;till a Garri&s;on, and kept for the Guard of the Coa&s;t, but 'tis of no great &s;trength, but by its &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In the middle of the&s;e va&s;t mountains (and forming a very large Lake, viz. near its fir&s;t Sources) ri&s;es the River De$, of which I &s;hall &s;peak again in its proper Place.</P>
<P>Here among innumerable Summits, and ri&s;ing Peaks of namele&s;s Hills, we &s;aw the famous Kader-$dricks, which &s;ome are of Opinion, is the highe&s;t mountain in Britain; another call'd Rarauvau$, an|no her call'd Mowylwynda, and &s;till every Hill we &s;aw, we thought was higher than all that ever we &s;aw before.</P>
<P>We enquired here after that &s;trange Phaenomenon which was not only &s;een, but fatally experinced by the Country round this Place, namely, of a livid Fire, coming off from the Sea; and &s;etting on Fire, Hou&s;es, Barns, Stacks of Hay and Corn, and poi&s;oning the Herbage in the Field; of which there is a full Account given in the Philo&s;ophical Tran|&s;actions: And as we had it confirm'd by the general Voice of the People, I con|tent my &s;elf with giving an Account of it as follows:</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that the Eclip&s;es of the Sun in Aries, have been very fatal to this Place; for in the Years 1542, and 1567, when the Sun was Eclip&s;ed in that Sign, it &s;uffer'd very much by Fire; and after the latter Eclip&s;e of the two, the Fire &s;pread &s;o far, that that a+bout 200 Hou&s;es in the Town and Sub|urbs of Caernarvon, were con&s;um'd.</P>
<P>But to return to the face of things, as they appear'd to us, the mounta nous country &s;poken of runs away $ through this county and almo&s;t the next, I mean Caernarvon&s;hire, where $word$ Hill is a mon&s;trous Height, and according to its Name, had Snow on the Top in the be|ginning of June; and perhaps had $o till the next June, that is to &s;ay, all the Year.</P>

The&s;e unpa&s;&s;able heights were doubt|le&s;s the Refuges of the Britains, when they made continual War with the Sax|ons and Romans, and retreated on oc|ca&s;ion of their being over-power'd, into the&s;e Parts; where, in &s;hort, no Enemy could per&s;ue them.</P>
<P>That &s;ide of the Country of Carnarvon, which borders on the Sea, is not &s;o mountainous, and is both more fertile and more populous. The principal Town in this Part, is Carnarvon, a good Town, with a Ca&s;tle built by Edward I. to curb and reduce the wild People of the moun|tains, and &s;ecure the Pa&s;&s;age into An|gle&s;ea. As this City was built by Edw. $word$ &s;o he kept his Court often here, and $onour'd it with his Pre&s;ence very much; $nd here his elde&s;t Son and Succe&s;&s;or, $ho' unhappy, (Edward II) was born, who was therefore call'd Edward of Ca|$rnarvon This Edward was the fir&s;t $rince of Wales; that is to &s;ay, the fir&s;t $f the Kings of Englands Sons, who was $e&s;ted with the Title of Prince of Wales: $nd here was kept the Chancery and $xchequer of the Prince's of Wales, or the N. part of the Principality, as $word$ was at&mdash;for the S Part. It is a $all, but &s;trong Town, clean and well $ilt, and con&s;idering the Place, the Peo|$le are very curteous and obliging to $rangers. It is &s;eated on the Firth or $let calll'd Menau, parting the I&s;le of $ngle&s;ea, or Mona, from the main Land; $d here is a Ferry over to the I&s;land $lled Abermenai Ferry: And from thence direct Road to Holly Head, where we $ent for no Purpo&s;e, but to have an|ther view of Ireland, tho' we were di&s;|$pointed, the weather being bad and $ormy.</P>
<P>Whoever travels critically over the&s;e $ountains, I mean of S. Wales, and Me|$onith&s;hire, will think Stone henge in $ilt&s;hire, and Roll-Rich Stones in Ox|$rd&s;hire no more a Wonder, &s;eeing there $e &s;o many &s;uch, and &s;uch like, in the&s;e $ovinces; that they are not thought &s;trange of at all, nor is it doubted, but they were generally Monuments of the Dead, as al&s;o are the &s;ingle Stones of immen&s;e Bulk any other, of which we &s;aw &s;o many, that we gave over re|marking them; &s;ome we &s;aw from 7, 8, to 10, and one 16 Foot high, being a whole &s;tone, but &s;o great, that the mo&s;t of the wonder is, where they were found, and how dragg'd to the Place; &s;ince, be&s;ides the &s;teep A&s;cents to &s;ome of the Hills on which they &s;tand, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to move &s;ome of them, now, with 50 Yoke of Oxen. And yet a great many of the&s;e &s;tones are found confu&s;edly lying one upon another on the utmo&s;t &s;ummit or top of the Glyder, or other Hills, in Merionith and Caer|narvon&s;hire; to which it is next to im|po&s;&s;ible, that all the Power of Art, and Strength of Man and Bea&s;t could carry them, and the People make no difficulty of &s;aying the Devil &s;et them up there.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e monumental &s;tones is to be &s;een a little way from Harleigh-Ca&s;tle: It is a large &s;tone lying &s;lat, &s;up|ported by three other &s;tones at three of the four Angles, tho' the &s;tone is rather oval than &s;quare, it is almo&s;t 11 Foot long, the breadth unequal, but in &s;ome places its from 7 to 8 Foot broad, and it may be &s;uppos'd has been both lon|ger and broader; 'tis in &s;ome places above 2 Foot thick, but in others 'tis worn al|mo&s;t to an Edge by Time: The three &s;tones that &s;upport it, are about 20 In|ches &s;quare, 'tis &s;uppos'd there has been four, two of which that &s;upport the thicke&s;t End, are near 8 Foot high, the other not above 3 Foot, being &s;uppos'd to be &s;ettled in the Ground, &s;o that the &s;tone lies &s;loping, like the Roof of a Bar$. There is another of the&s;e to be &s;een in the I&s;le of Angle&s;ea, the flat Stone is much larger and thicker then this but we did not go to &s;ee it: There are al&s;o two circles of &s;tones in that I&s;land, &s;uch as Stone-henge, but the &s;tones much larger.</P>

This is a particular kind of Monument, and therefore I took notice of it, but the other are generally &s;ingle Stones of va&s;t Magnitude, &s;et up on one end, Column wi&s;e, which being &s;o very large, are like|ly to remain to the end of Time; but are generally without any In&s;cription, or re|gular Shape or any Mark, to intimate for who, or for what they were &s;o placed.</P>
<P>The&s;e Mountains are indeed &s;o like the Alps, that except the Language of the People, one could hardly avoid thinking he is pa&s;&s;ing from Grenoble to Su&s;a, or rather pa&s;&s;ing the Country of the Gri&s;ons. The Lakes al&s;o, which are &s;o numerous here, make the Similitude the greater, nor are the Fables which the Country Peo|ple tell of the&s;e Lakes, much unlike the Stories which we meet with among the Switzers, of the famous Lakes in their Country; Dr. Gib&s;on, (Mr. Cambdens Continuator) tells us of 50 or 60 Lakes in Carnarvon&s;hire only, we did not count them indeed, but I believe if we had, we &s;hould have found them to be many more.</P>
<P>Here we met with the Char Fi&s;h, the &s;ame kind which we &s;ee in Lanca&s;hire, and al&s;o in the Lakes of Switzerland, and no where el&s;e, that I have heard of in Europe; the Welch call it the Torgoch.</P>
<P>There is nothing of Note to be &s;een in the Ifle of Angle&s;ea but the Town and the Ca&s;tle of Beaumaris&punc; which was al&s;o built by King Edward I&punc; and call'd Beau-Mar&s;h, or the Fine Plain; for here the Country is very level and plain, and the Land is fruitful and plea&s;ant The Ca&s;tle was very large, as may be &s;een by its re|mains, and that it was &s;trong; the Situa|tion will tell al&s;o, but 'tis now of no u&s;e.</P>
<P>As we went to Holly Head, by the S. Part of the I&s;land from Newborough, and came back thro' the middle to Beau|maris, we &s;aw the whole Extent of it, and indeed, it is a much plea&s;anter Conntry, than any part of N, Wales, that we had yet &s;een; and particularly is very fruitful for Corn and Cattle.</P>
<P>Here we cro&s;s'd the Fretum, or &s;trait of Menou again, and came to Bangor, at the Place where King Edward I. intend|ed to have built a great Stone Bridge, it wou'd indeed have been a Work fit for &s;o great and powerful a King, as K. Edward was: But the Bottom being doubtful, and the Sea in that Place &s;ometimes very $ag|ing and &s;trong, the Workmen thought it impracticable, and tho' as we were told, that the King was very po&s;itive in his De|&s;ign for a great while, yet he was pre|vail'd with at la&s;t to decline it.</P>
<P>From hence, I &s;ay, we cro&s;s'd to Ban|gor, a Town noted for its Antiquity, its being a Bi&s;hops See, and an old, mean looking&punc; and almo&s;t de&s;picable Cathedral Church.</P>
<P>This Church claims to be one of the mo&s;t Antient in Britain, the People &s;ay, 'tis the mo&s;t Antient; that St. Daniel (to whom this Church was Dedicated) was fir&s;t Bi&s;hop here, in the Year 512. They allow that the Pagans, perhaps of Angle|&s;ea, ruined the Church, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Bi&s;hoprick after it was fir&s;t built, for a|bove 100 Years; nor is there any account of it from the Year 512, to 1009: Af|ter this, the Bi&s;hoprick was ruined again by Dilapidation, by one of its own Bi|&s;hops, who&s;e Name was Bulkeley, who, as the Mona&s;ticon &s;ays, not only &s;old the Revenues, but even the very Bells, for which Sacrilege he was &s;truck Blind; but this la&s;t is a Tradition only.</P>
<P>It is certainly at pre&s;ent a poor Bi&s;hop|rick, and has but a poor Cathedral; yet the Bi&s;hops are generally allowed to hold &s;ome other good Benefice in Commendam, and the Preferment &s;eems to be a great|ful Introduction to the Clergy, as the Bi&s;hops are generally tran&s;lated from hence, to a more profitable Bi&s;hoprick.</P>
<P>From Bangor we went North, (keep|ing the Sea on our left Hand) to Con|way. This is the Poore&s;t but Plea&s;ante&s;t Town in all this County for the bigne&s;s of it; it is &s;eated on the Bank of a fine River, which is not only plea&s;ant and beautiful, but is a noble Harbour for Ships,
<PB REF="295">
had they any occa&s;ion for them there; the Stream is Deep and Safe, and the Ri|ver Broad, as the Thames at Deptford: $t only wants a Trade &s;uitable to &s;o good $ Port, for it infinitely out does Che&s;ter or Leverpool it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this Pa&s;&s;age, we went over the fa|mous Precipice call'd Penmen-muir, which $ndeed Fame has made abundance more $rightful, than it really is; for tho' the Rock is indeed very high, and if any one &s;hould fall from it, it wou'd da&s;h them in Pieces, yet, on the other hand, there is no danger of their falling; and be&s;ides, there is now a Wall built all the way, on the Edge of the Precipice, to &s;ecure them: Tho&s;e who have been at the Hill or Pa&s;s of Enterkin in Scotland, know very well, $he Danger there is much greater, than what can be thought of here; as the fre|$uent lo&s;s of Lives, both of Man and Hor&s;e will te&s;tify.</P>
<P>We have but little remarkable in the Road from Conway to Hollywell, but Craggs and Rocks all along the N. Shore $f Denbeigh, till we came to Denbeigh Town. This is the County Town, and $word$ a large populous Place, which carries $omething in its Countenance of its Neigh|$ourhood to England, but that which was mo&s;t &s;urprizing, after &s;uch a tire&s;om $nd fatigeing Journey, over the unho&s;pi|$$ble Mountains of Merioneth, and Car|$arvon&s;hire, was, that de&s;cending now $om the Hills, we came into a mo&s;t plea|$nt, fruitful, populous, and delicious $ale, full of Villages and Towns, the $$elds &s;hining with Corn, ju&s;t ready for $e Reapers, the Meadows green and &s;low|$$, and a fine River, with a mild and $entle Stream running thro' it: Nor is it &s;mall or ca&s;ual Intermi&s;&s;ion, but we had Pro&s;pect of the Country open before for above 20 Miles in Length, and $$m 5 to 7 Miles in Breadth, all &s;mil|$g with the &s;ame kind of Complexion; $hich made us think our&s;elves in Eng|land again, all on a &s;ndden.</P>
<P>In this plea&s;ant Vale, turning N. from $$nbeigh, and following the Stream of $word$ River, we came to S A&s;aph, a &s;mall City, with a Cathedral, being a Bi&s;hoprick of tolerable good Value, though the Church is old: It is but a poor Town, and ill built, tho' the Country is &s;o Plea&s;ant and Rich round it. There are &s;ome old Mo|numents in this Church, but none of any Note, nor could we read the Welch In|&s;criptions.</P>
<P>From hence we come to Holly-well: The Stories of this Well of St Winifrid are, that the pious Virgin, being ravi&s;hed and murthered&punc; this healing Water &s;prung out of her Body when buried; but this &s;mells too much of the Legend, to take up any of my time; the Romani&s;ts indeed believe it, as 'tis evident, from their thronging hither to receive the healing Sanative Virtue of the Water, which they do not hope for as it is a Medicinal Wa|ter, but as it is a Miraculous Water, and heals them by virtue of the Interce&s;&s;ion and Influence of this famous Virgin, St. Winifrid.</P>
<P>Here is a fine Chapel cut out of a &s;ol$d Rock, and was Dedicated to this Holy Virgin; and numbers of Pilgrims re&s;ort to it, with no le&s;s Devotion than Inno|cence; under this Chapel the Water gu&s;hes out in a great Stream, and the Place where it breaks out, is form'd like a Ba&s;on or Ci&s;tern, in which they bathe: The Wa|ter is inten&s;ely Cold, and indeed there is no great Miracle in that Point, con&s;ider|ing the Rocks it flows from, where it is impregnated by divers Minerals, the Vir|tue of which, and not of the Saint, I &s;uppo&s;e, work the greate&s;t Part of the Cures:</P>
<P>There is a little Town near the Well, which may, indeed, be &s;aid to have ri&s;en from the Confluence of the People hither, for almo&s;t all the Hou&s;es are either Pub|lick Hou&s;es, or let into Lodgings; and the Prie&s;ts that attend here, are very numerous, appear in Di&s;gui&s;e: Sometimes they are Phy&s;icians, &s;ometimes Surgeons&punc; &s;ometimes Gentlemen, and &s;ometimes Patients, or any thing as occa&s;ion pre|&s;ents. No Body takes Notice of them, as to their Profe&s;&s;ion, tho' they know

them well enough, no not the Roman Catholicks them&s;elves; but in private, they have their proper Oratory's in cer|tain Places, whither the Votaries re&s;ort; and good Manners has prevail'd &s;o far, that however the Prote&s;tants know who and who's together; no Body takes No|tice of it, or enquires where one an|other goes, or has been gone.</P>
<P>From hence we pa&s;t by Flint-Ca&s;tle, a known Place, but of no Significance; and then in a few Hours we cro&s;s'd the River Dee, and arriv'd at the City of We&s;t Che&s;ter, from whence, I &s;hall give a farther Account of my Journey in my Next.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY VII.</HEAD>
<P>I Have given you an Accouut of my Progre&s;s thro' Wales, and my coming to Che&s;ter, at the End of that really fatiguing Journey: I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I that have &s;een the Alps, on &s;o many Occa&s;ions, have gone under &s;o many of the mo&s;t frightful Pa&s;&s;es in the Country of the Gri&s;ons, and in the mountains of Tirol, never believed there was any thing in this I&s;land of Britain that came near, much le&s;s that exceeded tho&s;e Hills, in the terror of their A&s;pect, or in the Difficulty of Acce&s;s to them: But certainly, if they are out-done any where in the World, it is here: Even Hannibal him&s;elf wou'd have found it impo&s;&s;ible to have marched his Army over Snowden, or over the Rocks of Merioneth and Montgomery Shires; no, nor with all the help that Fire and Vi|negar could have yielded, to make way for him.</P>
<P>The only &s;upport we had in this heavy Journey, was, (1.) That we generally found their Provi&s;ions very good and cheap, and very good Accommodations in the Inns. (2.) That the Welc$ Gentlemen are very civil, ho&s;pitable, and kind; the People very obliging and con|ver&s;ible, and e&s;pecially to Strangers; but when we let them know, we travell'd merely in Curio&s;ity to view the Coun|try, and be able to &s;peak well of them to &s;trangers, their Civility was heighten|ed to &s;uch a Degree, that nothing could be more Friendly, willing to tell us eve|ry thing that belong'd to their Country, and to &s;how us every thing that we de|&s;ired to &s;ee.</P>
<P>They value them&s;elves much upon their Antiquity: The Ancient Race of their Hou&s;es, and Families, and the like; and above all, upon their Anicent Heroes. Their King Caractacus, Owen ap Tudor, Prince Lewellin, and the like Noblemen and Princes of Briti&s;h Extraction; and as they believe their Country to be the plea&s;ante&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable in the World &s;o you cannot oblige them more&punc; than to make them think you believe &s;o too.</P>
<P><PB REF="297">
The Gentlemen of Wales, indeed, ju&s;tly $aim a very Antient De&s;cent, and have $e&s;erv'd their Families entire, for many $ges: They receive you well into their $ou&s;es, treat you very hand&s;omely, are $ry generous; and indeed, nothing is $anting within Doors; and which is $ore than all, they have generally very $$od E&s;tates.</P>
<P>I continued at Che&s;ter for &s;ome time, $$cept that I made two or three Excur|$$ons into the Neighbouring Country, $$d particularly into that Part of Shrop|$ire which I had not view'd as I went; $word$ al&s;o into the North, We&s;t $$rt of Che&s;hire.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Trip I made, was into the $e&s;tria Cher&s;one&s;vs, as I think we may $$operly call it, (viz.) a piece of the $ounty, which runs out a great way to the Iri&s;h Sea, and is bounded by $e two great Firths, or Arms of the $$a, the one call'd the Mouth of the $ee, and the other of two Rivers, the $er&s;ey, and the Wever; this I&s;thmus or $eck of Land, is about 16 Miles long, $$d about fix or &s;even Miles over, and $s not one Market Town in it, tho' $s exceeding rich and fertile; the la&s;t oc|$&s;ioned po&s;&s;ibly by the Neighbourhood $word$ two &s;uch great Towns, or Cities ra|$$er&punc; I mean Che&s;ter and Liverpool.</P>
<P>Going down from Che&s;ter, by the Rhoo|$e, as they call it, that is, the Mar&s;hes $word$ the River Dee, and Coa&s;ting the Ri|$r after it is grown broader than the $ar&s;hes; the fir&s;t Place of any Note $hich we come to, is Ne&s;&s;on, a long $a&s;e or Ne&s;s of Land, which running $$t into the Sea, makes a kind of a Key. $his is the Place where in the late War Ireland, mo&s;t of the Troops embark'd, $hen that Grand Expedition begun; af|$r which, the Ve&s;&s;els go away to High|$e, in which as the Winds may hap|$$n they ride &s;afe in their Way, as the $ips from London lie in the Downs, $word$ the Wind pre&s;ents for their re&s;pec|$$ve Voyages.</P>
<P>From Ne&s;&s;on we cro&s;s'd over than fruitful Level I mentioned before, and coming to the other Water, we ferry'd over to Liverpool. This Town is now become &s;o great, &s;o populous, and &s;o rich, that it may be call'd the Bri&s;tol of this Part of England: It had formerly but one Church, but upon the encrea&s;e of In|habitants, and of new Buildings in &s;o ex|traordinary a Manner, they have built another very fine Church in the North Part of the Town; and they talk of erect|ing two more.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing we ob&s;erv'd in this Church, was a fine Marble Font, all of one entire Stone, given to the Town, or Church rather, by the late Robert Hey|&s;ham, E&s;q; a Citizen and very con&s;ider|able Merchant of London; who was ma|ny years Repre&s;entative for the Town of Lanca&s;ter. Here is a very fine new built Tower al&s;o, and in it a curious Ring of Eight, very good Bells.</P>
<P>This Part of the Town may indeed be call'd New Liverpool, for that, they have built more than another Liverpool that way, in new Streets, and $ine large Hou|&s;es for their Merchants: Be&s;ides this, they have made a great Wet Dock, for laying up their Ships, and which they greatly wanted; for tho' the Mer&s;ey is a noble Harbour&punc; and is able to ride a Thou&s;and Sail of Ships at once, yet tho&s;e Ships that are to be laid up, or lie by the Walls all the Winter, or longer, as &s;ometime may be the Ca&s;e; mu&s;t ride there, as in an open Road, or (as the Seamen call it,) be haled a &s;hore: neither of which wou'd be practicable in a Town of &s;o much Trade: And in the time of the late great Storm, they &s;uffer'd very much on that Account.</P>
<P>This is the only Work of its kind in England, except what is in the River of Thames, I mean for the Merchan$s; nor is it many years &s;ince there was not one wet Dock in England for private u&s;e, ex|cept Sir Henry John&s;on's at Black Wall.</P>
<P><PB REF="298">
This is &s;till an encrea&s;ing flouri&s;hing Town, and if they go on in Trade, as they have done for &s;ome time, 'tis pro|bable it will in a little time be as big as the City of Dublin. The Hou&s;es here are exceeding well built, the Streets &s;trait, clean, and &s;pacious, and they are now well &s;upplied with Water. The Mer|chants here have a very pretty Exchange, &s;tanding upon 12 Free &s;tone Columns, but it begins to be &s;o much too little, that 'tis thought they mu&s;t remove or enlarge it. They talk already as I have &s;aid a|bove, of building two Churches more at Leverpool, and &s;urrounding them with new Streets, to the N. E. of the old Town, which if they &s;hould, Leverpool will &s;oon out do Bri&s;tol: In &s;hort, 'tis al|ready the next Town to Bri&s;tol, and in a little time may probably exceed it, both in Commerce, and in Numbers of Peo|ple.</P>
<P>We went no farther this way at that time, but came back to Che&s;ter, by the &s;ame Ferry as we went over.</P>
<P>As I am now at Che&s;ter, 'tis proper to &s;ay &s;omething of it, being a City well worth de&s;cribing: Che&s;ter has four things very remarkable in it. 1. It's Walls, which are very firm, beautiful, and in good Repair. 2. The Ca&s;tle, which is al&s;o kept up, and has a Garri&s;on always in it. 3. The Cathedral. 4. The River Dee, and 5. the Bridge over it.</P>
<P>It is a very antient City, and to this Day, the Buildings are very old; nor do the Rows as they call them, add any thing, in my Opinion, to the Beauty of the City; but ju&s;t the contrary, they &s;erve to make the City look both old and ugly: The&s;e Rows are certain long Gal|leries, up one pair of Stairs, which run along the &s;ide of the Streets, before all the Hou&s;es, tho' joined to them, and as is pretended, they are to keep the People dty in walking along. This they do in|deed effectually, but then they take away all the view of the Hou&s;es from the Street, nor can a Stranger, that was to ride thro' Che&s;ter, &s;ee any Shops in the City; be&s;ides, they make the Shops them|&s;elves dark, and the way in them is dark, dirty, and uneven.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Ornament of the City, is, that the Streets are very broad and fair, and run through the whole City in &s;trait Lines, cro&s;&s;ing in the Middle of the City, as at Chiche&s;ter: The Walls as I have &s;aid, are in very good Repair, and it is a very plea&s;ant Walk round the City, upon the Walls, and within the Battlements, from whence you may &s;ee the Country round; and particularly on the &s;ide of the Roodee, which I mentioned before, which is a fine large low Green, on the Bank of the Dee. In the Winter this Green is often under Water by the Inundations of the River, and a little before I came there, they had &s;uch a terrible Land Flood, which flow'd 8 Foot higher than u&s;ual &s;o that it not only overflowed the &s;aid Green, called the Roodee, but de|&s;troy'd a fine new Wharf and Landing-Place for Goods, a little below the Town, bore down all the Warehou&s;es, and other Buildings, which the Merchants had er|ected for &s;ecuring their Goods, and car|ried all away Goods and Buildings toge|ther, to the irreparable Lo&s;s of the Per|&s;ons concern'd: Al&s;o beyond the Roodee, one &s;ees from the Walls, of Che&s;ter the County of Flint, and the Mountains of Wales, a Pro&s;pect be&s;t indeed, at a Di&s;|&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle of Che&s;ter is a good firm Building, and &s;trong, tho' not fortify'd, with many out Works: There is always a good Garri&s;on kept, and here the Pri|&s;oners taken at Pre&s;ton, in the late time of the Rebellion, were kept a great while, till compa&s;&s;ion to their Mi&s;ery, mov'd the Clemency of the Conqueror to deliver them. They &s;ay this Ca&s;tle was Built or at lea&s;t Repaired by Hugh Lupus&punc; the famous Earl of Che&s;ter, and Brother to William the Conqueror as al&s;o was the Church.</P>
<P>The great Church here is a very mag|nificent Building, but 'tis built of a red, &s;andy, ill looking Stone, which takes
<PB REF="299">
much from the Beauty of it, and which yielding to the Weather, &s;eems to crumble, and &s;uffer by Time, which much defaces the Building: Here they &s;hew'd us the Monument of Henry IV. Emperor of Germany; who they &s;ay, re&s;ign'd his Empire, and liv'd a Reclu&s;e here, but 'tis all to be taken upon tru&s;t, for we find nothing of it in Hi&s;tory. We &s;aw no Monument of any Note, which is partly occa&s;ioned by its remote Situation, and partly by its being but a Modern Bi&s;hop|rick; for it was formerly a Part of the Dioce&s;s of Litchfield, and was not made a Bi&s;hop's See till the Year 1541; when King Henry VIII. divided it from Litch|field; nor has there ever been above 19 Bi&s;hops of this See from its Foundation. The &s;hort Account of it is thus. Hugh Lupus gave the old Mona&s;tary Dedicated to St. Werburge, to a Society of Monks, a&s;ter which, they &s;ay, King Edgar who conquered all this Part of Britain, and was rowed up the Dee, in his Royal Barge, by four Kings, founded the great Church; and Hugh Lupus the Great, Earl of Che&s;ter, fini&s;hed and endow'd it.</P>
<P>Here is a noble Stone Bridge over the Dee, very high and &s;trong built, and 'tis needful it &s;hould be &s;o, indeed; for the Dee is a mo&s;t furious Stream at &s;ome Sea&s;ons, and brings a va&s;t Weight of Wa|ter with it from the Mountains of Wales. Here it was that the fir&s;t Army of King William de&s;igned for the War in Ire|land, and Commanded by the Great Duke Schomberg, encamped&punc; for a con&s;iderable Time before they embark'd, Ann 1689.</P>
<P>Here according to the Mona&s;ticon, the &s;aid Hugh Lupus held his Parliament for the County Palatine of Che&s;ter, given him by William the Conqueror, and where he &s;at in as great State as the King him&s;elf. The Draught of which, as it is given us from Antiquity take as fol|lows.</P>
<P>There are 11 Pari&s;hes in this City, $nd very good Churches to them, and it $ the large&s;t City in all this Side of Eng|land that is &s;o remote from London. When I was formerly at this City, about the Year 1690, they had no Water to &s;upply their ordinary Occa&s;ions, but what was carried from the River Dee upon Hor&s;es, in great Leather Ve&s;&s;els, like a Pair of Bakers Panyers; ju&s;t the very &s;ame for Shape and U&s;e, as they have to this Day in the Streets of Con&s;tantinople, and at Belgrade, in Hungery, to carry Water about the Streets to &s;ell, for the People to drink But at my coming there this time, I found a very good Water|hou&s;e in the River, and the City plenti|fully &s;upplyed by Pipes, ju&s;t as London is from the Thames; tho' &s;ome Parts of Che&s;ter &s;tands very high from the Ri|ver.</P>
<P>Tho' this is not an antient Bi&s;hoprick, 'tis an antient City, and was certainly a Frontier of the Roman Empire $his way; and its being &s;o afterwards to the Engli&s;h Empire al&s;o, has doubtle&s;s been the rea|&s;on of its being &s;o well kept, and the Ca&s;tle continued in repair, when mo&s;t of the other Ca&s;tles on the Frontier $span$ &s;lighted and demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This County, how ever remote from London, is one of tho&s;e which contri|butes mo&s;t to its Support, as well as to &s;everal other Parts of England, and that is by its Excellent Chee&s;e, which they make here in &s;uch Quantities, and &s;o ex|ceeding good, that as I am told from ve|ry good Authority, the City of London only ta$es off 14000 Ton every Year; be&s;ides 8$00 Ton which they &s;ay goes every Yer down the Rivers Seven and Trent, the former to Bri&s;t$l, and the lat|ter to York; including all the Towns on both the&s;e large Rivers: And be&s;ides the Quantity &s;hiped both here, and at Lever|pool, to go to Ireland, and Scotland. So that the Quantity of Chee&s;e made in this Country, mu&s;t be prodigious great. In|deed, the whole County is employed in it, and part of its Neighbourhood too; for tho' 'tis all called by the Name of Che&s;hire Chee&s;e, yet great Quantities of it are made in Shrop&s;hire, Stafford&s;hire and Lanca&s;hire, that is to &s;ay, in &s;uch Parts of them as border upon Che&s;hire.</P>
<P><PB REF="300">
The Soil is extraordinary good, and the Gra&s;s they &s;ay&punc; has a peculiar richne&s;s in it, which di&s;po&s;es the Creatures to give a great quantity of Milk, and that very &s;weet and good; and this Chee&s;e Manufacture, for &s;uch it is, encrea&s;es every Day, and greatly enti$hes all the County; rai&s;es the Value of the Lands, and encourages the Farmers to the keep|ing va&s;t &s;tocks of Cows; the very Num|ber of the Cattle improving and enrich|ing the Land.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t Part of the County abounds in Salt Springs from which they drew the Brine, and boyl it into fine Salt: and once it was a very con&s;iderable Trade, which they carried on with this Salt; but &s;ince the Di&s;covery of the Rock Salt, which they dig in great quantities, to|wards Warrington, the other Salt is not in &s;o much reque&s;t.</P>
<P>I now re&s;olv'd $o direct my Cour&s;e Ea&s;t, and making the Wever and the Trent, my Northern Boundary in this Circuit; I came forward to view the Midland Counties of England, I mean &s;uch as may be &s;aid to lye between th$ Thames and the Trent.</P>
<P>I had taken a little Trip into the N. E. Parts of Che&s;hire before, &s;een a fine old Seat of the Lord Delamere's, and which is beyond it all, the fine Fore&s;t, which bears the Name of that noble Family; intending to &s;ee the Salt Pits at North|wich, which are odd indeed&punc; but not &s;o very &s;trange as we were made to believe, the thing is, they &s;ay, the Salt Spring is $ound to be ju&s;t perpendicularly under the Stream or Channel of a fre&s;h Water River, namely, the Wever, and it is &s;o for the Spring is very deep indeed in the Ground, but that very thing takes off the Wonder; for as the Earth under the Ri|ver, is but as a Gutter to carry the Wa|ter, there is no difficulty that it &s;hould not penetrate through it, the Soil being a &s;trong Clay. So we came a way not ex|tremely gratify'd in our Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>All the way as we cro&s;s'd this Part of the County, we &s;ee Bee&s;ton Ca&s;tle, an Antient Family in this County. It $word$ upon a very high Hill, over looking the County, like as Beavoit Ca&s;tle over looks the Vale of that Name in Leice&s;ter&s;hire or Harrow on the Hill overlooks Middle &s;ex. It was formerly a very &s;trong Place and was Refortify'd in the late Wars Sir William Bee&s;ton being in Arms at that unhappy time, but the demoli&s;h'd again.</P>
<P>From Nortwich we turn'd S. and follow|ing the &s;tream of the River by Middle $word$ we cro&s;s'd the great London Road a$ Nantwich, or as &s;ome write it Nampw$$$h, the$e is a fourth which is called D$oit|wych, in Worce&s;ter&s;hire; the nature of the thing is this, they boil the Brine into &s;ine Salt, which is much priz'd for the Beauty of its Colour, and firmne&s;s of the Grain, but the Salt is not &s;o &s;trong&punc; as what we now make from the Rock Salt mentioned above, and therefore lo&s;es of its Value.</P>
<P>Hence we turn'd a little We&s;t to Whit|church, in Shrop&s;hire. But before I leave Che&s;hire, I mu&s;t note two things of it. (1.) That there is no part of England, where there are &s;uch a great Number of Families of Gentry, and of &s;uch Ancient and Noble Extraction; Mr. Cambden is very particular in their Names, and De|&s;cents, but that's a Work too long for this Place, nor does it belong to my pre|&s;ent De&s;ign. (2.) That it is a C$aut$ Palatine, and has been &s;o for many Ages that its Government is di&s;tinct from any other and very particular; it is $word$ &s;tred by a Chamberlain, a Judge $word$ two Barons, of the Exchequer, three Ser|jeants at Law, a Sheriff an Attorney an E&s;cheator, and all proper and $word$ &s;ubordinate Officers; and the Juri&s;diction of all the&s;e Offices are kept up, and pre+&s;erved very &s;trictly, only we are to note that the Judge &s;pecial as he is called tries only Civil Cau&s;es, the Criminal which are left to the Ordinary Judge$ of England, who go the Circuits here&punc; $word$ in other Places.</P>
<P>Whitechurch is a plea&s;ant and populous Town, and has a very good Church, in
<PB REF="301">
which is the famous Monument of the Great Talbot, fir&s;t Earl of Shrewsbury, who, perhaps, and not unworthily, was call'd in his Time, the Engli&s;h <HI>Achilles.</HI> This is the Talbot &s;o renowned in the ancient Wars in France, whom no Man in France dare to Encounter &s;ingle handed, and who had Engraven on his Sword, on one &s;ide, the&s;e Words, <HI>Sum Talboti,</HI> and on the rever&s;e. <HI>Pro vincere inimicos mees.</HI> His Epitaph is as follows:</P>
<P>ORATE PRO ANIMA PRAENOBI|LIS DOMINI, DOMINI IOANNIS TAL|BOTT QUONDAM COMITIS SALO|PLE, DOMINI $ALBOTI, DOMINI EVRNIVALL, DOMINIVERDON, DO|MINISTRANGE DE BLACKMERE, ET MARESCHALLI FRANCE$AE, QUI OBILT IN BELLO APUD BURDEWS VII. IVLU MCCCC$I$I.</P>
<P>That is,</P>
<P>Pray for the &s;oul of the right honour|able Lord, John Talbott, &s;emetime Earl $f Shrewsbury. Lord Talbott, Lord Fur $ival, Lord Verdon. Lord Strange of $l$$$mere, and Mar&s;hall of France who $ed in battle, at Burdeaux, VII. of $ly MCCCCLIII.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t to be &s;aid of this Town $word$ is, that they have a good Market, $word$ a great many Gentry near it, where|$$ are Roman Catholicks. They $word$ us that this Town when K. Charles $tanov'd his Standard from Netting|$$$ to Shrew-bury, rai&s;ed a whole Re|$ent for the King: Nor has this Town $word$ old loyal Principle, to this time; $word$ now it may run a little another $word$.</P>
<P>From hence we went towards Wales $in, and cro$s'd the Dee, at Banger|dge: I could not &s;atisfy my&s;elf to $word$ feeing this &s;amous Town, which $word$ once to remarkable, but was fur|$$ when I came there&punc; to &s;ee there a Stone Bridge over the Dee, and indeed, a very &s;ine one: But as for the Town or Mona&s;tery, &s;carce any of the Ruins were to be &s;een, and as all the People &s;poke W$l$$, we could find no Body that could give us any intelligence. So effectually had time in &s;o few Years. rais'd the very Foundations of the Place, I will not &s;ay, as &s;ome do, that this is miraculous, and that it is the particular Judgment of God upon the Place, for be|ing the Birth place of that Arch Here|tick Pelagius, who from hence al&s;o be|gan to broach his Heretical Opinions, which afterwards &s;o terribly over&s;pread the Church: I &s;ay I will not in&s;i&s;t upon this: That Pelagius was a Monk of Bun|gor, or Banchor, is not doubted; but for the re&s;t I leave it where I find it.</P>
<P>This Place is now (I &s;ay) a poor contemptible Village, and has nothing to &s;how but a fine Stone Bridge over Dee, by which we enter Deubigh&s;hire in Wales. From thence we vi&s;ited Wrex|ham, having heard much of a fine Church there, but we were greatly di&s;appointed: There is indeed a very large Tower Steeple, if a Tower may be call'd a Steeple, and 'tis finely adorn'd with Imagery; but far from fine; the Work is mean, the &s;ta|tues &s;eem all mean and in dejected Po|&s;tures, without any fancy or &s;pirit in the Workman&s;hip, and as the &s;tone is of a reddi&s;h crumbling Kind, like the Cathe|dral at Che&s;ter, time has made it look gro&s;s and rough.</P>
<P>There are a great many ancient Monu|ments in this Church, and in the Church|yard al&s;o; but none of Note, and almo&s;t all the in&s;crip$ious are in Welch. The Church is large; but they mu&s;t be much mi&s;taken who tell us 'tis the &s;ine&s;t in Eng|land, no not among tho&s;e which are as old as it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This town is large, well built and po|pulous&punc; and be&s;ides the Church there are two large Meeting ho$tes, in one of which we are told they preach in Welch one Part of the Day, and in Engli&s;h the other. Here is a great market for Welch Flan|uel which the Factors buy up of the
<PB REF="302">
poor Welch People, who manufacture it; and thence it is &s;ent to London; and it is a very con&s;iderable Manufacture indeed thro' all this Part of the Country, by which the Poor are very profitably em|ployed.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd South, and pa&s;|&s;ing by Wem, the Title given by King Ja$$$s II. to the late Lord Chancellor Je&s;&s;$$$es, we &s;aw the Hou&s;e where his Father, then but a private Gen&s;eman lived, and in but middling Circum&s;tances. Thence we came to F$l&s;mere, famous for a great $ake or Mere, which gives the Town its Name, and which the People pretend has in &s;ome P$a$$$ no Bottom. This Place is remarkable for good Fi&s;h. From hence we came the &s;ame Night to $hrewsbury.</P>
<P>This is indeed a beautiful, large prea|&s;ant, populous, and rich Town; full of Gentry and yet full of Tra$$ too; for here too, is a great Manufacture, as well of Flannel, as al&s;o of white Broadcloth, which enriches all the Country round it.</P>
<P>The Severn &s;urrounds this Town, ju&s;t as the Thames does the I&s;le of Dogs; &s;o that it makes the Form of an Hor$e-&s;hoe, over which there are two &s;ine &s;tone Bridges, upon one of which is built a very noble Gate, and over the Arch of the Gate the $$$tue of the Great Lewcllin, the Idol $word$ the Welch, and their la&s;t Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>This is really a Town of Mirth and Galla$try, &s;omething like Bury in Su&s;&s;olk, or Durham in the North&punc; but much big|ger than either of them, or indeed than both together.</P>
<P>Over the Market-hou&s;e is kept a kind of Hall for the Manufactures, which are &s;old here weekly in very great Quantities; they &s;peak all Engli&s;h in the Town, but $word$ a Market Day you would think you were in Wales.</P>
<P>Here is the greate&s;t Market, the great|e&s;t Plenty of good Provi&s;ions, and the cheape&s;t that is to be met with in all the We&s;tern Part of England; the Severn &s;up|plies them here with excellent Salmon, h$t 'tis al&s;o brou$ht in great Plenty from the River Dee, which is not fat off, and which abounds with a very good Kind, and is generally larger than that in the Severn; As an Example of the Cheap|ne&s;s of Provi&s;ions, we paid here, in a publick Inn, but a Groat a Night for Hay&punc; and Six-pence a Peck for Cats for our Hor&s;es, which is cheaper than we found it in the cheape&s;t Part of the North of England; all our other Provi&s;ions were in Proportion; and there in no do$$$ but the Cheapne&s;s of Provi&s;ious joined to the Plea&s;antne&s;s and Healthine&s;s of the Pla$$&punc; draws a great many Famil$$$ $word$ $word$ love to live within the $word$ $word$ $word$ E&s;tates.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden cails it a City: 'Tis at this Day, &s;ays he, a fine City well inha|bited: But we do not now $word$ it a City, yet 'tis equal to many good Ci$es in Eng|land, and &s;uperior to &s;ome. Near this Place was &s;ought the bloody Battle be|tween Henry Hot&s;pur and Henry IV. King of England, in which the &s;ormer was kill'd, and all his Army overthrown, and the Place is called Battlefield to this Day.</P>
<P>Here are four very fine Churc$es, whereof two St. Chad's and St. Mary'$&punc; are &s;aid to be anciently Collegiate: T$$$ are abundance of ancient Monuments $word$ them all, but too many to mention her$&punc; my Journey being too long, and $word$ Bounds too &s;hort to enter upon the $$$|ticulars.</P>
<P>This Town will for ever be $$$ous $word$ the Reception it gave to King Char$$$ the I. who, after &s;$tting up $word$ Stan$$$$ at Nottingham, and &s;inding $word$ $ncourag$|ment there, removed to $word$ b$|ing invited by the Gentry of the Town and Country round, where he was re|ceiv'd with &s;uch a general $word$ and hearty Zeal by all the $word$ that his Maje&s;ty recov$red the $word$ $word$ his fir&s;t Step at Nottingham and r$i&s;ed and compleated a &s;trong $word$ in le&s;s Time than could be imagin'd&punc; $word$ that to the Surprize of the $word$ and indeed of all the Wor$$ he was $word$ the Field before them, and $word$ $word$ them to $a&s;t, that he met $word$ $wo $word$
<PB REF="303">
onward of his Way to London, and gave them Battle at Edge hill near Banbury.</P>
<P>But the Fate of the War turning after|ward again&s;t the King, the Weight of it fell heavy upon this Town al&s;o, and al|mo&s;t ruined them.</P>
<P>But they are now fully recovered, and it is at this Time one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing Towns in England; The Walls and Gates are yet &s;tanding, but u&s;ele&s;s, and the old Ca&s;tle gone to Ruin, as is the Ca&s;e of almo&s;t all the old Ca&s;tles in Eng|land.</P>
<P>It &s;hould not be forgotten here, that notwith&s;tanding the Healthyne&s;s of the Place, one Blot lies upon the Town of Shrewsbury, and which, tho' nothing can $e charged on the Inhabitants, yet it &s;eems they are the mo&s;t obliged when 'tis lea&s;t &s;poken of; namely, that here broke out fir&s;t that unaccoutable Plague, called The Sweating Sickne&s;s; which at fir&s;t baffled all the Sous of Art, and &s;pread it &s;elf through the whole Kingdom of England: This happened in the Year 1551. It af|t$rwards &s;pread it&s;elf into Germany, and &s;everal Countries abroad: But I do not remember that it was ever in Spain or in Italy.</P>
<P>Here is an ancient Free School, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in this Part of England; built and endow'd by Queen Elizabeth, with a very &s;ufficient Mam$a$$$nce for a Chief or Head Ma&s;ter, and three $word$ or U&s;h$$$. The Buildings are $word$ &s;pacious, and particularly the Libra|$y is a &s;ine Building, and has a great ma|$y Books in it; but I law nothing curious o$ rare among them, and no Manu&s;cripts. The School ma&s;ters have al&s;o very hand|&s;ome Hou&s;es to dwell in.</P>
<P>There was a &s;ine School here before, $ c$ted by the Towns-People, and main|tained &s;everal Years by their Contributi|on, and &s;ome Endowments al&s;o it had. But the Queen being &s;en&s;ible of the good De&s;ign of the Inhabitants, took the Ma&s;|ter into her own Hand, and built the whole Fabrick n$w from the Ground, endowing it liberally out of her own Royal Bounty,</P>
<P>Here I was &s;hew'd a very vi&s;ible and remarkable Appearauce of the great anti|ent Road or Way call'd Watling Street, which comes from London to this Town, and goes on from hence to the utmo&s;t Coa&s;t of Wales; where it cro&s;s'd the Se|vern, there are Remains of a &s;tone Bridge to be &s;een in the Bottom of the River, when the Water is low. On this Road we &s;et out now for Litchfield in our Way towards London; and I would gladly have kept to this old Road, if it had been po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e I knew &s;everal remark|able Places &s;tood directly upon it. But we were obliged to make many Excur&s;i|ons, and &s;ometimes quit the Street for a great Way together: And fir&s;t we le&s;t it to go away South to the Edge of Stafford|&s;hire, to &s;ee the old Hou&s;e called White Ladies, and the Royal O$k, the famous Retreat of King Charles $word$ after the Battle of Worce&s;ter. The Tree is &s;ur|rounded with a Pali&s;ad$e, to pre&s;erve i$ from the Fate which threatned it from Curio&s;ity; for almo&s;t every Body that came to &s;ee it for &s;everal Years, carryed away a Piece of it, &s;o that the Tree was litterally in Danger not to dye of Age, but to be pull'd Limb from Limb; but the Veneration of that Kind is much a|bated, and as the Pali&s;adoes are more de|cayed than the Tree, the latter &s;eems likely to &s;tand &s;afe without them&punc; as for the Hou&s;e, there is nothing remarkable in it; but it being a Hou&s;e always inhabi|ted by Roman Catholicks, it had, and perhaps has &s;till &s;ome Rooms &s;o p$ivate in it, that in tho&s;e Times could not have been di&s;covered without pulling down the whole Buildings.</P>
<P>Entring Stafford &s;hire we quitted the &s;aid Street-way, a little to the left, to &s;ce Stafford the County Town, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable except Litch&s;ield in the Coun|ty In the Way we were &s;urp$$zed in a mo&s;t agreeable Manner, pa&s;&s;ing thr$' a &s;mall but ancient Town called Penkrig$, vulgarly Pan$rage, where happened to be a Fair. We expected nothing extraordin|ary; but was I &s;ay &s;upriz'd to &s;ee the prodigious Number of Hor&s;es brought
<PB REF="304">
hither, and tho&s;e not ordinary and com|mon Draught-Hor&s;es, and &s;uch Kinds as we generally &s;ee at Country-Fairs re|mote from London: But here were really incredible Numbers of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful Hor&s;es that can any where be &s;een; being brought hither from York|&s;hire, the Bi&s;hoprick of Durham, and all the Hor&s;e&punc;Breeding Countries: We were told that there were not le&s;s than an hundred Jockies and Hor&s;e&punc;Kopers, as they call them there, from London, to buy Hor&s;es for &s;ale. Al&s;o an incredible Number of Gentlemen attended with their Grooms to buy Gallopers&punc; or Race-Hor&s;es, for their Newmarket &s;port. In a Word I believe I mark it for the greate&s;t Hor&s;e Fair in the World&punc; for Hor&s;es of Value, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e we call Sad|dle-Hor&s;es There are indeed greater Fairs for Coach&punc;Hor&s;es, and Draught Hor&s;es; though here were great numbers of fine large Stone Hor&s;es for Coaches, &amp;c. too. But for Saddle-Hor&s;es, for the light Saddle, Hunters, Pads, and Racers, I believe the World cannot match this Fair.</P>
<P>We &s;taid three Days here to &s;atisfy our Curio&s;ity, and indeed the &s;ight was very agreeable, to &s;ee what va&s;t &s;tables of hor&s;es there were, which never were brought out or &s;hewn in the Fair. How dextrous the Northern Grooms and Breeders are in their looking after them, and or|dering them: Tho&s;e Fellows take &s;uch indefatigable Pains with them, that they bring them out like Pictures of Hor&s;es, not a Hair ami&s;s in them; they lie con|&s;tantly in the &s;tables with them, and feed them by weight and mea&s;ure; keep them &s;o clean, and &s;o &s;ine, I mean in their Bodies, as well as their Cu&s;ides, that, in &s;hort, nothing can be more nice. Here were &s;everal Hor&s;es &s;old for 150 Guineas a Hor&s;es; but then they were &s;uch as were famous for the Breed, and know by their Race, almo&s;t as well as the Arabians know the Genealogy of their Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>From hence we came in two hours ca&s;y Riding to Stafford, on the River Sow; 'tis an old and indeed ancient town; and gives name to the County; but we thought to have found &s;omething more worth going &s;o much out of the Way in it, The Town is however near and well built, and is lately much encreas'd; nay, as &s;ome &s;ay, grown rich by the Cloathing Trade, which they have fallen into but within the Reach of the pre&s;ent Age, and which has not enrich'd this town only, but Tamworth al&s;o, and all the Country round.</P>
<P>The People of this Country have been particularly famous, and more than any other County in England, for good $$$t|man&s;hip, and there have been&punc; and &s;t$ll are among them, &s;ome of the $$$$&s;t Run|ners in England; which I do not great to be occa&s;ion'd by any particular Tem|porature of the Air or Soil &s;o much as to the hardy Breed of the Inhabitants $$|pecially in the Moorlands or Northe$ Part of the county, and to their ex$$|&s;ing them&s;elves to it from their ch$$d|hood; for running Foot-Races &s;eems to be the general &s;port or Diver&s;ion of the country.</P>
<P>Near Stafford we &s;aw Inge&s;tre, where the late Walter Chetwynd, E&s;q; built or rather rebuilt a very fine church at his own charge, and where the late Lord Chet|wynd has with a Profu&s;ion of Expence laid out the fine&s;t Park and Gardens that are in all this Part of England, and Gar|dens that are in all this Part of England, and which, if nothing el&s;e was to be led this way, are very well worth a Travil|ler's curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>I am now at the utmo&s;t of $word$ Limus for this circuit; for $span$ reach to the very Banks of the $word$ which I am not to pa&s;s; &s;o I turn to $span$ and intend for Litchfield, $n t$$ way $word$ &s;aw Beande&s;ert&punc; a famous $span$ be built by Hugh Lupus, $span$ The name indeed intimat$$&punc; to be $word$ Norman or French Original&punc; $span$ it is in the honourable Famnly $word$ $he P$|gets, and the $ord Paget is al&s;o $word$ $word$ Beande&s;ert. The Park is very &s;ine&punc; an$ its &s;ination exceeding $word$ but the
<PB REF="305">
Hou&s;e is ancient; in the Park is a fa|mous piece of Antiquity, viz. a large entrench'd camp or Fortification, &s;urround|ed with a double Trench, very large and deep; but the inhabitants can give no Account of it, that is worth Notice.</P>
<P>From hence 'tis about four or five Miles to Lithfield, a City, and the Prin|cipal, next to Che&s;ter, of all the North We&s;t part of England; neither indeed is there any other, but this and Coven|try, in the whole Road from London to Carli&s;le on the edge of Scotland.</P>
<P>Here we came into the great Lanca|&s;hire and Che&s;hire Road, or the North We&s;t Road from London, which pa&s;&s;ing thro' this City from Warrington Bridge in Che&s;hire, falls into the Watling-&s;treet Road, mention'd before, about three Miles South Ea&s;t from the Town, and cro&s;&s;es another ancient Cau&s;eway or Road, call'd $ckneild-&s;treet, about a Mile out of the City; &s;o that Litchfield lies as it were at the joining of all tho&s;e great Roads.</P>
<P>Litchfield is a fine, neat, well built, and different large City; there is a little Lake or Lough of Water in the middle of $word$ out of which runs a &s;mall &s;tream of Water, which &s;oon becomes a little Ri|$ulet, and &s;ave that it has but four or $$ve Miles to the Trent, would &s;oon be|come a River: This Lake parts Litch|$eld, as it were, into two Cities, one $word$ call'd the Town, and the other the Clo&s;e; in the fir&s;t is the Market-place, $word$ $s;ine School, and a very hand&s;ome Ho&s;|$ital well endow'd. This Part is much $e large&s;t and mo&s;t populous: But the $ther is the faire&s;t, has the be&s;t Build|$ngs in, and, among the re&s;t, the Cathe|$ral Church, one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t $eautiful in England, e&s;pecially for the $ut&s;ide, the Form and Figure of the $uilding, the carv'd work'd, Imagery, $word$ the three beautiful Spires; the like $word$ which are not to be &s;een in one Church, $o not in Europe.</P>
<P>There are two fine Cau&s;eways which join the City and the Clo&s;e, with Slui|ces to let the Water pa&s;s, but tho&s;e were cut thro' in the Time of the late in|te&s;tine Wars in England, and the Clo&s;s, which is wall'd about, and was then fortify'd for the King, was very &s;trong, and &s;tood out &s;everal vigorous Attacks again&s;t Cromwell's Men, and was not at la&s;t taken without great Lo&s;s of Blood on both &s;ides, being gallantly defended to the la&s;t Drop, and taken by &s;torm.</P>
<P>There are in the Clo&s;e, be&s;ides the Hou&s;es of the Clergy Re&s;identiaries, a great many very well-built Hou&s;es, and well inhabited too, which makes Litch|&s;ield a Place of good Conver&s;ation and good Company, above all the Towns in this County or the next, I mean War|wick&s;hire or Darby&s;hire.</P>
<P>The De&s;cription of this Church would take up much Time, and requires a very nice Ob&s;erver. The See is very ancient&punc; and was once Archiepi&s;copal, and Eadulp the Archbi&s;hop was Metropolitan of all the Kingdom of the Mercians and Ea&s;t Angles, but it did not hold it; then it &s;uffer'd another Dimunition, by having the See of Che&s;ter taken away, which was once Part of this of Litchfield.</P>
<P>They told tis here a long Story of St. Chad, formerly Bi&s;hop of this Church, and how he liv'd in a little Hovel or Cell in the Church-yard, in&s;tead of a Bi|&s;hop's Palace: But the Bi&s;hops, &s;ince that Time, have, I &s;uppo&s;e, thought better of it and make &s;hift with a very fine Pa|lace in the Clo&s;s, and the Re&s;identiaries live in Proportion to it.</P>
<P>They have another Legendary Story al&s;o at Litehfield; namely, that a thou|&s;and poor People being in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Faith by the care of O&s;fa King of the Mercians, were all martyr'd here in one Field by the Pagans, and that in the Field where they were &s;o murder'd, King Olwy of Northumberland cau&s;ed a great Church to be built; and from thence
<PB REF="306">
the City bears for its Device, a Landskip, or open Field, with mangled Carca&s;&s;es lying di&s;pers'd about in it, as if murder'd and left unburied: But this I take as I find it.</P>
<P>The Church I &s;ay is indeed a mo&s;t beautiful Building; the We&s;t Pro&s;pect of it is charming, the two Spires on the Cor|ner Towers being in them&s;elves perfect Beauties of Architect, in the old Gotheic Way of Building, but made &s;till more &s;hining, and glorious by a third Spire, which ri&s;ing from the main Tower in the Body of the Church, &s;urmounts the other two, and &s;hews it&s;elf exactly between them.</P>
<P>It is not ca&s;y to de&s;cribe the Beauty of the We&s;t End; you enter by three large Doors in the Porch or Portico, which is as broad as the whole Front; the Spaces between the Doors are fill'd with carved Work and Imagery, no Place being void, where (by the Rules of Architect) any Ornament could be plac'd.</P>
<P>Over the fir&s;t Corni&s;h is a Row of Statues or Images of all the Kings which reign'd in Jeru&s;alem from King David to the Captivity; but I cannot &s;ay that they are all &s;uffic$ently di&s;tingui&s;hed one from another: Above there are other Images without Number, who&s;e Names no Ac|count (I could meet with there) could ex|plain.</P>
<P>The great Window $span$ the middle Door is very large, and the Pediment over it finely adorn'd, a large Cro&s;s fini&s;hing the Top of it; on $$$her Corner of the We&s;t Front are two very fine Towers, not unlike the two Towers on the We&s;t End of St. Peter's Church at We&s;tmin&s;ter, only infinitely finer: Even with the Battlement of the Porch, and adjoining to the Towers, are large Pin|nacles at the outer Angles, and on the Top of the Towers are to each Tower eight more, very beautiful and fine; be|tween the&s;e Pinnacles, on the Top of each Tower, ri&s;es a Spire equal in Height, in Thickne&s;s, and in Workman&s;hip, but &s;o beautiful no Pen can de&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>The Imagery and carv'd Work on the Front, as above, has &s;uffered much in the late unhappy Times; and they told us the Cro&s;s over the We&s;t Window was fre|quently &s;hot at by the rude Soldiers; but that they could not &s;hoot it down, which however they do not &s;ay was miracul|ous.</P>
<P>The In&s;ide of the Church al&s;o &s;uffered very much, but it has been very well re|paired &s;ince the Re&s;toration, as well by the famous Bi&s;hop Hacket, as by the Bounty of &s;everal noble and generous Be|nefactors.</P>
<P>The Mona&s;ticon makes Mention of a Shrine given here for the holy St. Chad, or St. Cedda, which co&s;t 200000 l. but I conceive that to &s;mell as much of the Legend, as the Miracles of St Chad him|&s;elf; &s;ince &s;uch a Gift at that Time mu&s;t be equal to two Millions of our Mo|ney.</P>
<P>They tell us the main Spire of this Church is, from the Ground, 385 Foot, and the two Spires at the Angles of the We&s;t End each 260.</P>
<P>From Litchfield we came to Tamworth, a fine plea&s;ant trading Town, eminent for good Ale and good Company, of the middling Sort; from whence we came in|to the great Road again at Cole&s;hill in Warwick&s;hire.</P>
<P>This is a &s;mall but very hand&s;ome Mar|ke$town; it chiefly, if not wholly be|longs to the Lord Digby, who is Lord of the Mannor, if not real Owner of almo&s;t all the Hou&s;es in the Town, and as that noble Per&s;on is at pre&s;ent a little on the wrong Side as to the Government, not having taken the Oaths to King George, &s;o the whole Town are &s;o eminently that Way too, that they told me there was but one Family of Whiggs, as they call'd them, in the whole Town, and they hop|ed to drive them out of the Place too very quickly.</P>
<P>The late incumbent of this Pari&s;h quit|ted his Living, which is very con&s;ider|able, becau&s;e he would not take the Oaths, and his Succe&s;&s;or was the famous who, when I was there, was
<PB REF="307">
newly pro&s;crb'd by Proclamation, and Reward of 1000 l. order'd to whoever &s;hould apprehend him; &s;o their In&s;tructors being &s;uch, 'tis no Wonder the People have follow'd their Leader.</P>
<P>From Coles hill we came to Coventry, the Si&s;ter City to Litchfield, and join'd in the Title of the See, which was for &s;ome little Time &s;eated here, but afterwards re|turned to Litchfield.</P>
<P>It was a very unhappy Time when I fir&s;t came to this City; for their Heats and Animo&s;ities for Election of Members to &s;erve in Parliament&punc; were carry'd to &s;uch a Hight, that all Manner of Method being laid a&s;ide, the Inhabitants (in &s;hort) enraged at one another, met, and fought a pitched Battle in the middle of the Street, where they did not take up the breadth of the Street, as two Rabbles of People would generally do; in which Ca&s;e no more could engage, but &s;o many as the breadth of the Street would admit in the Front; but, on the contrary, the two Parties meeting in the Street, one Party kept to one &s;ide of the Way, and one &s;ide to the other, the $$nnel in the Middle only parting them, and &s;o march|ing as if they intended to pa&s;s by one another, 'till the Front of one Party was come oppo&s;ite to the Reer of the other, and then &s;uddenly facing to one another, and making a long Front, where their Flanks were before, upon a Shout given, as the Signal on both Sides, they fell on with &s;uch Fury with Clubs and Staves, that in an In&s;tant the Kinnel was cover'd with them, not with &s;lain, but with &s;uch as were knock'd down on both Sides, and, in a Word, they fought with &s;uch Ob&s;tinacy that 'tis &s;carce credible.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e the Scum and Rabble of the Town, but in &s;hort the Burghers and chief Inhabitants, nay even Magi&s;trates, Aldermen, and the like.</P>
<P>Nor was this one Skirmi&s;h a Deci&s;ion of the Quarrel, but it held for &s;everal Weeks, and they had many &s;uch Fights; nor is the Matter much better among them to this Day, only that the Occa&s;ion does not happen &s;o often.</P>
<P>Coventry is a large and populous City&punc; and drives a very great Trade; the Ma|nufacture of Tammies is their chief Em|ploy, and next to that Weaving of Rib|bons of the meane&s;t Kind, chiefly Black. The Buildings are very old, and in &s;ome Places much decay'd; the City may be taken for the very Picture of the City of London, on the South Side of Cheap&s;ide before the great Fire; the Timber built Hou&s;es, projecting forwards and towards one another, till in the narrow Streets they were ready to touch one another at the Top.</P>
<P>The Tale of the Lady Godiva, who rode naked thro' the high Street of the City to purcha&s;e her beloved City of Co|ventry Exemption from Taxes, is held for &s;o certain a Truth, that they will not have it que&s;tion'd upon any Account what|ever; and the Picture of the poor Fellow that peep'd out of a Window to &s;ee her, is &s;till kept np, looking out of a Garret in the high Street of the City: But Mr. Cambden &s;ays po&s;itively no body look'd at her at all.</P>
<P>There are eleven Churches in this City; but three of them are particular Orna|ments to it, having fine high Spires, after the Manner of tho&s;e at Litchfield, but nothing like them for the Beauty of the Building. Here is no Cathedral, as &s;ome have fal&s;ly &s;aid, neither is the great Church, &s;o called, either Collegiate or Conven|tual.</P>
<P>It was indeed a Mona&s;try or Priory, and, as has been &s;aid, the Bi&s;hop's See was remov'd from Che&s;ter hither, but no Ca|thedral was built, for the Change was not continued, and the See was &s;oon remov'd to Litchfield, where it continues to this Day.</P>
<P>Yet this City contended a great while for it in deed, but could not carry it. In King Henry 8th's Time, the Priory be|ing di&s;&s;olv'd, the Church which they would have called a Cathedral, was reduc'd to a private Pari&s;h&punc;Church, and continues &s;o to this Day; 'tis an Archdeaconry indeed, and the Bi&s;hop is &s;tiled Bi&s;hop of Litch|field and Coventry.</P>
<P><PB REF="308">
From Coventry we could by no means pa&s;s the Town of Warwick, the di&s;tance too being but about &s;ix Miles, and a very plea&s;ant Way on the Bank of the River Avon: 'Tis famous for being the Re&s;idence of the Great Guy Earl of Warwick, known now only by Fame, which al&s;o lias &s;aid &s;o much more than the Truth of him, that even what was true is become a kind of Ro|mance, and the real Hi&s;tory of his Actions is quite lo&s;t to the World.</P>
<P>That th$re was &s;uch a Man, no body (I find) makes a que&s;tion, any more than they do that half of what is &s;aid of him is Fable and Fiction; but be that as it will, they &s;how us here his Ca&s;tle, his Helmet, his Sword, and tell abundance of things of him, which have &s;ome appearance of Hi&s;tory, tho' not much Authority to &s;up|port them; &s;o I leave that Part to the cu|rious Searchers into Antiquity, who may con&s;ult Mr Cambden, Rous, Dugdale, and other Antiquaries on that Subject who tell us the Ca&s;tle was built before our Sa+viour's Time, and has been a Place of great Con&s;ideration ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>As to the Town of Warwick, it is really a fine Town, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the Bank of the Avon, over which there is a large and &s;tately Bridge, the Avon be|ing now grown a pretty large River, Warwick was ever e&s;teem'd a hand&s;ome, well built Town, and there were &s;everal good Hou&s;es in it, but the Face of it is now quite alter'd; for having been almo&s;t wholly reduc'd to a Heap of Rubbi&s;h&punc; by a terrible Fire about two and twenty Years ago, it is now rebuilt in &s;o noble and &s;o beautiful a Manner, that few Towns in England make &s;o fine an Appearance. The new Church al&s;o is a fine Building, but all the old Monuments, which were ve|ry many, are entirely defac'd, and lo&s;t by the Fire: However the Memory and even the Figure of 'em are eminently pre&s;erv'd by Mr. Dugdale, in his Antiquities this County, to which I refer.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle is a fine Building, beautiful both by Situation and its Decoration; it &s;tands on a &s;olid Rock of Free-&s;tone, from who&s;e Bowels it may be &s;aid to be built, as likewi&s;e is the whole Town; the Ter|ra&s;s of the Ca&s;tle, like that of Wind&s;or, overlooks a beautiful Country, and &s;ees the Avon running at the Foot of the Percipice, at above 50 Foot perpendicular Hight: the Building is old, but &s;everal Times re|pair'd and beautify'd by its &s;everal Owners, and 'tis now a very agreeable Place both within and without: the Aparments are very nicely contrived, and the Communi|cation of the remote&s;t Parts of the Build|ing, one with another, are &s;o well pre&s;erved by Galleries, and by the great Hall, which is very manificent, that one finds no Ir|regularity in the whole Place, notwith|&s;tanding its ancient Plan, as it was a ca&s;tle not a Palace, and built for Strength rather than Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this ca&s;tle is now in the Family of Grevil Lord Brook, but the Honour and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is &s;eparated, and has been for &s;ome Time, the ancient Fa|mily of Beauchamp, or Bello Camdo, E. of Warwick, held it for many Ages, from whom 'tis now de&s;cended to the Earls of Holland, who are Earls of Holland and al&s;o of Warwick. But this by the Way.</P>
<P>Here we &s;aw the antient Cell or Her|mitage, where they &s;ay the famous Guy Earl of Warwick ended his days in a pri|vate Retreat for his Devotion, and is from him call'd Guy Clifr, by others Gib|clift; 'tis now, as Mr. Cambden gives an Account, which Mr. Dugdale al&s;o con|firms, the plea&s;ant &s;eat of an ancient Nor|man family of the Name of De Beau-&s;$e, who&s;e po&s;terity remain there, and in &s;e|veral other parts of the county, retain|ing the latter Part of their Sirname, but without the former to this Day. Mr. Dugdale gives the Monuments of them, and it appears they removed hither, on account of &s;ome Marriage, from Seyton in Rutland&s;hire, where they were Lords of the Mannor, and Patrons of the Church&punc; and were &s;everal of the Name al&s;o &s;till remain.</P>

Being at Warwick, I took a &s;hort cir|cuit thro' the S. E. part of the country, re&s;olving, after viewing a little the places of Note, that lay &s;omething out of my Intended rout, to come back to the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>Three miles from Warwick we pa&s;&s;ed over the Fo&s;s Way, which goes on to Leice&s;ter; then we came by Southam to Daventry a con&s;iderable Market Town, but which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly by the great concour&s;e of Travellers on the old Wat|ling-&s;treet way, which lies near it; and the Road being turned by modern U&s;age, lies now thro' the Town it&s;elf, then runs on to Dun&s;more Heath, where it cro&s;&s;es the Fo&s;s, and one branch goes on to Co|ventry, the other joins the Fo&s;s, a d goes on to a place called High&punc;Cro&s;s, where it falls into the old Watling &s;treet again, and both meet again near Litch|field</P>
<P>It is a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Curio&s;ity to ob|&s;erve the cour&s;e of the&s;e old famous Highways; the Ickn$ld Way, the Wat|ling &s;treet, and the Fo&s;s, in which one &s;ees &s;o lively a Repre&s;entation of the $ncient Briti&s;h Roman and Saxon Go|vernments, that one cannot help realliz|$ng tho&s;e Times to the Imagination; and $ho' I avoid meddling with Antiquity as $uch as po&s;&s;ible in this Work, yet in his ca&s;e a Circuit or Tour thro' Eng|$and would be very imperfect, if I &s;hould $ake no notice of the&s;e ways, &s;eeing in $acing them we nece&s;&s;arily come to the $rincipal Towns, either that are or have $een in every country.</P>
<P>From Daventry we cro&s;&s;ed the coun|$y to Northampton, the hand&s;ome&s;t and $word$ built Town in all this part of Eng|$$nd; but here, as at Warwick, the beau|$ of it is owing to its own Di&s;a&s;ters, $word$ it was &s;o effectually and &s;uddenly $word$ down, that very few hou&s;es were $word$ &s;tanding, and this, tho' the fire began $word$ the day time; the flame al&s;o &s;pread $elf with &s;uch fury, and run on with $word$ terrible &s;peed, that they tell us a $wn&s;man being at Queen's Cro&s;s upon a Hill, on the South &s;ide of the Town, about two miles off, &s;aw the fire at one end of the Town the$ newly begun, and that before he could get to the Town at the remore&s;t end, oppo&s;ite to that where he fir&s;t &s;aw it; 'tis now finely rebuilt with Brick and Stone, and the Streets made &s;pacious and wide.</P>
<P>The great new Church, the Town|hall, the Jayl, and all their publick Build|ings, are the fine&s;t in any Country Town in England, being all new built: But he to$k very little notice of Northampton, or rather had never &s;een it, who told us of a Cathedral, a Chapter hou&s;e and a Cl$y&s;ter.</P>
<P>The great Inn at the George, the Cor|ner of the high Street, looks more like a Palace than an Inn, and co&s;t above 2000 l. building; and &s;o generous was the Owner, that, as we were told, when he had built it, he gave it to the Poor of the Town.</P>
<P>This is counted the Center of the Hor&s;e Markets, and Hor&s;e Fairs in Eng|land, there being here no le&s;s then four Fairs in the Year; here they buy Hor&s;es of all So$ts, as well for the Saddle as for the Coach and Cart, but chiefly for the two latter.</P>
<P>Near this Town is the ancient Royal Hou&s;e of Holmby, which was formerly in great E&s;teem, and by its Situation is capable of being a Royal Palace indeed. But the melancholy Reflection of the Im|pri&s;onment of King Charles the Fir&s;t in this Hou&s;e and his being violently ta|ken hence again by the mutinous Re|bels, has a kind of Odium upon the Place, &s;o that it has been, as it were, for&s;aken and uninhabited. The Hou&s;e and E&s;tate has been lately purchas'd by the Dutche&s;s of Marlborough; but we do not &s;ee that the Hou&s;e is like to be built or repair'd, as was at fir&s;t di&s;|cours'd; on the contrary it goes daily to Decay.</P>
<P>The Earl of Sunderland's Hou&s;e at Althorp, on the other Hand, has within the&s;e few Years changed its Face to the other Extreme, and had the late Earl liv'd

to make &s;ome new Apartments, which, as we were told, were de&s;igned as two large Wings to the Buildings, it would have been one of the mo&s;t magnificent Palaces in Europe The Gardens are exqui&s;itely fine, and add, if it be po&s;&s;ible to the natural Beauty of the Situation.</P>
<P>From hence we went North to Har|bourgh, and in the Way, in the Mid&s;t of the deep di&s;mal Roads, the dirtie&s;t and wor&s;t in all that Part of the Country, we &s;aw Boughton, the noble Seat of the Duke of Mo$$tague, a Hou&s;e built at the Co&s;t and by the Fancy of the late Duke&punc; very much after the Model of the Palace of Ver&s;ailles; the treble Wings projecting and expanded, forming a Court o$ Space wider and wider, in proper Stades, an|&s;werable to the Wings, the Body of the Hou&s;e clo&s;ing the whole View.</P>
<P>The Pavillions are al&s;o after the Man|ner of Ver&s;ailles; the Hou&s;e it&s;elf is very large and magnificent, but the Situation facing &s;o beautiful a Park adds to the Glory of it; the Park is wall'd round with Brick, and &s;o finely planted with Trees, and in &s;uch au excellent Order, as I &s;aw nothing more beautiful, no not in Italy it&s;elf, except that the Walks of Trees were not Orange and Limon, and Citron, as it is in Naples, and the Abruzzo, and other Southern Parts of Italy.</P>
<P>Here they &s;hew'd us a petrifying Spring and told us &s;o many Stories of its turning every Thing that was laid in it into Stone, that we began to di&s;credit the Tale as fa|bulous; but I have been a&s;&s;ured, that the Water of this Spring does really petrify, and that in &s;uch a Manner as de&s;erves the Ob&s;ervation of the Curious.</P>
<P>From hence we went on to Harborough intending to go forward to Leice&s;ter; but Curio&s;ity turned us We&s;t a little to &s;ee an old Town called Lutterworth famous for being the Birth-place of hone&s;t John Wick|lif, the fir&s;t Preacher of the Reformation in England, who&s;e Di&s;ciples were after|wards called Lollards; when we came there we &s;aw nothing worth Notice, nor did the People, as I could find, &s;o much as know in general, that this great Man was born among&s;t them.</P>
<P>Being thus got a little out of our Way, we went on with it, and turning into the great Watling &s;treet Way, at High Cro&s;s, where the Fo&s;s cro&s;&s;es it, and which I &s;up|po&s;e occa&s;ioned the Name, we kept on the Street Way to Non Eaton, a manu|facturing Town on the River Auker, and then to Ather&s;tone, a Town famous for a great Chee&s;e Fair on the 8th of Septem|ber; from whence the great Chee&s;e Fac|tors carry the va&s;t Quantities of Chee&s;e they buy to Sturbridge Fair, which be|gins about the &s;ame Time, but holds much longer; and here 'tis &s;ould again for the Supply of the Counties of E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk, and Norfolk.</P>
<P>From Ather&s;ton we turned N. to &s;ee Bo&s;worth Field, famous for the great Bat|tle which put an End to the U&s;urpation of Richard III. and to the long and bloody Contention between the red Ro&s;e and the White, or the Two Royal Hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, which, as Fame tells us, had co&s;t the Lives of Eleven Princes, Three and Twenty Earls and Dukes, Three Thou&s;and Noblemen, Knights, and Gentlemen, and Two Hun|dred Thou&s;and of the common People: They &s;hew'd us the Spot of Ground where the Battle was fought, and at the Town they &s;hewed us &s;everal Pieces of Swords, Heads of Lances, Barbs of Arrows, Pie|ces of Pole-Axes, and &s;uch like $word$ of Death, which they &s;aid were found by the Country Peple in the &s;ever|al Grounds near the Place of Battle, as they had occa&s;ion to dig, or trench, or plough up the Ground.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfy'd our Curio&s;ity in the&s;e Points, we turn'd Ea&s;t towards Leice&s;ter The E. of Stamford has a good old hunt|ing Seat on this Side of the Country, called Bradgate, and a fine Park at Gro$|by; but they were too much ou$ of our Way, &s;o we came on through a fine For|e&s;t to Leice&s;ter.</P>
<P>Leice&s;ter is an ancient large and populous Town, containing about five Pari&s;hes, 'tis
<PB REF="311">
$he Capital of the County of Leice&s;ter, and &s;tands on the River Soar, which ri&s;es hot far from that High Cro&s;s I mentioned before: They have a con&s;iderable Manu|facture carryed on here, and in &s;everal of the Market Towns round for Weaving of Stockings by Frames; and one would &s;carce think it po&s;&s;ible &s;o &s;mall an Article of Trade could employ &s;uch Multitudes of People as it does; for the whole County &s;eems to be employed in it: As al&s;o Nottingham and Darby, of which hereafter.</P>
<P>Warwick&s;hire and Northamton&s;hire are not &s;o full of Antiquities, large Towns, and Gentlemens Seats, but this County of Leice&s;ter is as empty. The whole County &s;eems to be taken up in Country Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ueh as the Manufacture above, but par|ticularly in breeding and feeding Cattle; the large&s;t Sheep and Hor&s;es in England are found here, and hence it comes to pa&s;s too, that they are in Con&s;equence a va&s;t Magazine of Wool for the re&s;t of the Nation; even mo&s;t of the Gentlemen are Gra&s;iers, and in &s;ome Places the Gra&s;iers are &s;o rich, that they grow Gentlemen: 'tis not an uncommon Thing for Gra&s;iers here to rent Farms from 500 l. to Two Thou&s;and Pounds a Year Rent.</P>
<P>The Sheep bred in this County and Lincoln&s;hire, which joins to it, are, with|out Compari&s;on, the large&s;t, and bear not only the greate&s;t Weight of Fle&s;h on their Bones, but al&s;o the greate&s;t Fleeces of Wool on their Backs of any Sheep of England: Nor is the Finene&s;s of the Wool abated for the Quantity; but as 'tis the longe&s;t Staple, (&s;o the Clothiers call it) &s;o 'tis the fine&s;t Wool in the whole I&s;land, &s;ome few Places excepted, &s;uch as Lem&s;ter in H$reford&s;hire, the South Downs in Su&s;&s;ex, and &s;uch little Places, where the Quantity is &s;mall and in&s;ignificant, com|puted to to this Part of the Country; for the Sheep breeding Country reaches from the River Anker on the Border of War|wick&s;hire to the Humber at the farthe&s;t End of Lincoln&s;hire, which is near a Hun|dred Miles in length, and from the Bank of Trent in Lincoln and Leice&s;ter&s;hire, to the Bank of Ou&s;e bordering Bucks, Bed|ford, Cambridge, and Huntingdon&s;hires, above Sixty Miles in breadth.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Funds of Sheep which furni&s;h the City of London with their large Mutton in &s;o incredible a Quantity: There are indeed a few Sheep of a large Breed, which are brought up from Rum|ney Mar&s;h, and the adjoining low Grounds in Kent and Su&s;&s;ex, but they are but few, and indeed &s;carce worth naming, com|pared to the va&s;t Quantity, which are produced in the&s;e Counties.</P>
<P>The Hor&s;es produced here, or rather fed here, are the large&s;t in England, be|ing generally the great Black Coach Hor|&s;es, and Dray Hor&s;es, of which &s;o great a Number are continually brought up to London. that one would think &s;o little a Spot as this of Leice&s;ter&s;hire could not be able to &s;upply them: Nor indeed are they all bred in this County, the adjoin|ing Counties of Northampton and Bed|ford having of late come into the &s;ame Bu&s;ine&s;s; but the chief &s;upply is from this County, from whence the other Counties rather buy them and feed them up, as Jockeys and Chapmen, than breed them up from their beginning.</P>
<P>In the South We&s;t part of the Country ri&s;e four con&s;iderable &s;econd rate Rivers, which run every one a directly contrary Cour&s;e in a mo&s;t remarkable Manner.</P>
<P N="1">1 The Avon, which runs by Rugby, and goes away to Warwick; South We&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Soar, which runs by Leice&s;ter, and goes away to the Trent; North Ea&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Anker, which runs by Nun-Fa$on, and goes away to Tamworth; North We&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4 The Welland, which runs by Har|borough, and goes away to Stamford; South We&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not pa&s;s over this ju&s;t Remark of the Town, or, as Mr. Cambden calls it, City of Leice&s;ter, namely, that as it was formerly a very &s;trong and well for|tify'd
<PB REF="312">
Town, being &s;ituated to great Ad|vantage for Strength, the River compa&s;|&s;ing it half about, &s;o it was again fortify'd in the late unhappy Wars, and being gar|ri&s;on'd by the Parliament Forces, was a&s;&s;aulted by the Royali&s;ts, and being ob|&s;tinately defended, was taken Sword in Hand, with a great Slaughter, and not without the Lo&s;s al&s;o of &s;everal of the Inhabitants, who too ra&s;hly concern'd them&s;elves in oppo&s;ing the Conquerors. They pre&s;erve here a mo&s;t remarkable Piece of Antiquity, being a Piece of Mo|&s;ai$k work at the Botrom of a Cellar; 'tis the Story of Actaeon, and his being kill d by his own Hounds, wrought as a Pavement in a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Manner; the Stones are &s;mall, and of only two Colours, white or Brown, or Che&s;nut, and very &s;mall.</P>
<P>The great Henry Duke of Lanca&s;ter, and the Earl his Father lye both bury'd in this Town, in the Ho&s;pital Church, without the South gate, which Church and Ho&s;pital al&s;o the &s;aid Duke was the Founder of; but there is no Monument to be found that &s;hews the particular Place of their Interment.</P>
<P>The Fo&s;s way leads us from hence through the Ea&s;tern and North Ea&s;t part of the county, and particularly through the Vale of belvoir, or, as it is common|ly call'd, of Bever, to Newark in Not|tingham&s;hire: In all this long Tract we pa&s;s a rich and fertile Country, fruitful Fields, and the noble River Trent, for twenty Miles together, often in our View; the Towns of Mount Sorrel, Loughborough, Melton Mowbray, and Waltham in the would, that is to &s;ay, on the Downs; all the&s;e are Market Towns, but o$ no great Note.</P>
<P>Belvoir ca&s;tle is i$ deed a noble &s;ituati|on, tho' on a very high Precipice; 'tis the antien$ &s;eat of the Dukes of Rutland, a Family ri&s;en by ju&s;t Degrees to an im|men&s;e &s;tate both of Honour and wealth. I &s;hall mention the Hou&s;e again in my Re|turn out of Lincoln&s;hire.</P>
<P>At Newark one can hardly &s;ee with|out Regret the Ruins of that famous Ca&s;tle, which maintain'd it&s;elf through the whole Civil War in England, and keeping a &s;trong Garri&s;on there for the King to the la&s;t, cut off the greate&s;t Pa&s;s into the North that is in the whole Kingdom; nor was it ever taken, till the King, pre&s;s'd by the calamity of his Af|fairs, put him&s;elf into the hands of the Scots Army, which lay before it, and then commanded the Governor to deli|ver it up, after which it was demoli&s;h'd, that the great Rood might lye open and free: and it remains in Rubbi&s;h to this Day. Newark is a very hand&s;ome well built Town, the Market-place a noble &s;quare, and the Church is large and &s;pacious, with a curious Spire, which, were not Grantham &s;o near, might pa&s;s for the fine&s;t and highe&s;t in all this Part of England: The Trent divides it&s;elf here, and makes an I&s;land, and the Bridges lead ju&s;t to the Foot of the Ca|&s;tle Wall; &s;o that while this Place was in the Hands of any Party, there was no Travelling but by their leave: But all the Travelling into the North at that Time was by Nottingham Bridge, of which by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>From Newark, &s;till keeping the Fo&s;s Way, which lies as &s;trait as a Line can mark it out, we went on to Lincol$ ha|ving a View of the great Church call'd the Min&s;ter all the way before us, the River Trent on the Left, and the Downs call'd Lincoln Heath on the Right.</P>
<P>Lincoln is an ancient, ragged, d$cay'd, and &s;till decaying City; it is &s;o full of of the Ruins of Mona&s;teries and religi|ous Hou&s;es, that, in &s;hort, the very Bar$s, Stables, Out-hou&s;es, and, as they &s;hew'd me, &s;ome of the very Hog &s;tyes, were built Church Fa&s;hion; that is to &s;ay, with Stone Walls and arch'd Windows ond Doors. There are here thirteen Churches, but the meane&s;t to look on that are any where to be &s;een, the cathe|dral indeed and the Ruins of the old ca|&s;tle are very venerable Pieces of Antiqui|ty.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the City is very par|ticular; one Part is on the flat and in a
<PB REF="313">
Bottom, &s;o that the Wittham, a little River that runs through the Town, flows &s;ometimes into the &s;treet, the other Part lies upon the Top of a high Hill, where the Cathedral &s;tands, and the very &s;teepe&s;t Part of the A&s;cent of the Hill is the be&s;t Part of the City for Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s,</P>
<P>Nothing is more trouble&s;ome than the communication of the upper and lower Town, the &s;treet is &s;o &s;teep and &s;o &s;trait, the Coaches and Hor&s;es are oblig'd to fetch a compa&s;s another way, as well one hand as on the other.</P>
<P>The River Wittham, which as I &s;aid runs thro' the City, is arch'd over, &s;o that you &s;ee nothing of it as you go thro' the main &s;treet; but it makes a large Lake on the We&s;t &s;ide, and has a Canal, by which it has a communication with the Trent, by which means the Navi|gation of the Trent is made u&s;eful for Trade to the City; this Canal is called the Fo&s;s dike.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome very good Buildings, and a great deal of very good company, in the upper City, and &s;everal Families of Gentlemen have Hou&s;es there, be&s;ides tho&s;e of the Prebendaries and other Clergy belonging to the Cathedral.</P>
<P>This Cathedral is in it&s;elf a very noble &s;tructure, and is counted very fine, though $ thought it not equal to &s;ome that I have already de&s;crib'd, particularly not to that at Litchfield: Its &s;ituation indeed is $nfinitely more to Advantage, than any Cathedral in England, for it is &s;een far $nd wide; it &s;tands upon an exceeding high Hill, and is &s;een into 5 or 6 Counties.</P>
<P>The Building in general is very noble, $nd the Church it&s;elf is very large; it $as a double Cro&s;s, one in the Nave or Center on which the great Tower &s;tands, $nd one at the Ea&s;t End of the Choir, $nder which are &s;everal ancient Monu|$en$s; the length of the Church is near $oo Foot, the Breadth 126; &s;o that it is $uch larger than that at Litchfield; but $o &s;pires on the Towers at the Angles $f the We&s;t End are mean, &s;mall, and low, and not to be nam'd with tho&s;e at Litchfield: The Tower al&s;o is very plain and has only four very ill-proportion'd Spires, or rather Pinnacles, at the four corners &s;mall and very mean.</P>
<P>As the Church is very large, &s;o the Revenue of the Bi&s;hoprick is large al&s;o, and was formerly immen&s;ely great, as may be &s;een by the Mona&s;ticon, where there is an a&s;toni&s;hing Account of the wealth of the Place.</P>
<P>The Church, as it is the &s;eat of the Bi&s;hoprick, is not ancient, the See being remov'd, &s;ince the Norman conque&s;t, from Dorche&s;ter, a little Town in Ox|ford&s;hire, on the River Thames, not far from Tame, of which I have &s;poken in its Place; but the City is ancient, and the Ruins of it tell us as much; it was certainly a flouri&s;hing City in the time of the Romans, and continued &s;o after the fall of their Empire.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden &s;ays King Vortimer, that valiant Britain, died here, and was bury'd in the Church of the great Mona|&s;tery; but we &s;ee nothing of his Re|mains in the Cathedral, for that was not built till &s;everal Ages after.</P>
<P>The City was a large and flouri&s;hing Place at the time of the Norman con|que&s;t, tho' neither the ca&s;tle or the great church were then built; there were then three and fifty Pari&s;h churches in it, of which I think only thirteen remain; the chief Extent of the city then was from the Foot of the Hill South, and from the Lake or Lough which is call'd Swan|pool Ea&s;t; and by the Dome&s;day Book they tell us it mu&s;t be one of the greate&s;t Cities in England, whence perhaps that old Engli&s;h Proverbal Dine:</P>
<P><HI>Lincoln</HI> was, <HI>London</HI> is, and <HI>York</HI> &s;hall be.</P>
<P>It is certain William the Conqueror built the Ca&s;tle, and, as 'tis &s;aid, to curb the po$ent Citizens; and the Ruins &s;hew that it was a mo&s;t magnificent work, well fortify'd, and capable of receiving of a nu|merous Garri&s;on.</P>

The Bi&s;hoprick of Lincoln at that Time contain d all that now is contain'd in the Dioce&s;&s;es of Ely, Peterborough, and Ox|ford, be&s;ides, what is now the Dioce&s;s of Lincoln; And 'tis &s;till the large&s;t Dio|ce&s;s, tho' not of the greate&s;t Revenue, in England; containing the &s;everal Counties of Lincoln, Leice&s;ter, Huntingdon, Bed|ford, Bucks, and Part of Hertford; and in them 1255 Pari&s;hes, whereof 577 are Impropriations; and there are in this Bounds &s;ix Archdeacons, viz.

<P>He$e was the famous Battle fought be|tween the Friend of the Empre&s;s Maud, Mother to Henry II. and King Stephen, in which that magnanimous Prince was overthrown and taken Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>But all this relates to Times pa&s;t, and is an Excur&s;ion, which I &s;hall attone for by making no more. Such is the pre&s;ent State of Lincoln, that it is an old dying, decay'd, dirty City; and except that Part, which, as above, lies between the Ca&s;tle and the Church, on the Top of the Hill, it is &s;carce tolerable to call it a City.</P>
<P>Yet it &s;tands in a mo&s;t rich, plea&s;ant, and agreeable Country; for on the North, and again on the South Ea&s;t, the noble Plain, call'd Lincoln Heath, extends it|&s;elf, like the Plains about Salisbury, for above fifty Miles; namely, from Sl$$|ford and Anca&s;ter South to the Bank of the Humber North, tho' not with a Breadth equal to the va&s;t &s;tretch'd out Length; for the Plain is hardly any where above three or four Miles broad.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t Side of this Plain, the Trent Waters a plea&s;ant and rich Valley, running from Newark to Gainsborough, a Town of good Trade, as well foreign as home Trade, thence to Burton, and $word$ into the Humber.</P>
<P>As the Middle of the Country is all hilly, and the We&s;t Side low, &s;o the Ea&s;t Side is the riche&s;t, mo&s;t fruitful, and be&s;t cultivated of any County in England, &s;o far from London; one Part is all Fen or Mar&s;h Grounds, and extends it&s;elf South to the I&s;le of Ely, and here it is that &s;o va&s;t a Quantity of Sheep are fed, as makes this County and that of Leice&s;ter an in|exhau&s;tible Fountain of Wool for all the manufacturing Counties in England.</P>
<P>There are abundance of very good Towns too in this Part, e&s;pecially on the Sea Coa&s;t, as Grimsby, in the utmo&s;t point of the County North Ea&s;t, facing the Humber and the Ocean, and almo&s;t op|po&s;ite to Hull: A lit$le farther within Humber is Barton, a Town noted for no|thing that I know of but an ill-favoured dangerous Pa&s;&s;age, or Ferry, over the Humber to Hull; where in an open Boat, in which we had about fifteen Hor&s;es, and ten or twelve Cows, mingled with about &s;eventeen or eighteen P$&s;&s;engers, call'd Chri&s;tians; we were about four Hours to&s;s'd about on the Humber, be|fore we could get into the H$$bour at Hull; whether I was $word$ &s;ick or not, is not worth $word$, $word$ that we were all &s;ick of the $word$ $span$ one may &s;uppo$$&punc; and $word$ I was &s;o $word$ at $word$ that I $span$ by York, rather than return $word$ $word$, at lea&s;t for that Time.</P>
<P>Grimsby is a good Town, but I think $word$ but an indifferent Road for Shipping; and in the great Storm, (A$n. 170$.) it was proved to be $word$ $word$ almo&s;t all the Ships that lay in $word$ $word$ by Road were driven from their Anchors, and many of them lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Here within Land we &s;ee Brigg upon the River A$kam, $span$, Lou$h, Corn|ca&s;tle, Bolingbroke, $word$ by, Wain$leet,

and Bo&s;ton: As the&s;e are all, except the la&s;t, Inland Towns, they afford little re|markable, only to intimate that all this Country is employ'd in Husbandry, in Breeding and Feeding innumerable Droves and Flocks of black Cattle and Sheep: Indeed I &s;hould not have &s;aid black Cat|tle, I &s;hould have call'd them red Cattle; for it was remarkable, that almo&s;t all their Cows for 50 Miles together are red or Py'd red and white, and con&s;equently all the Cattle rai&s;ed there, are the &s;ame; what they feed which are brought from other Counties, (for the Fens feed infinite Numbers which they buy from other Places;) that (I &s;ay) is another Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Fen Country begins about Wain|&s;le$t, which is within twenty Miles of Grimsby, and extends i$&s;el$ to the i&s;le of Ely South, and to the Grounds oppo&s;ite to Lynn Regis in Norfolk Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>This Part is indeed very properly $word$ Holland, for 'tis a flat, level, and often drowned Country, like Holland it|$elf; here the very Ditches are navigable, $nd the People pa&s;s from Town to Town $n Boats, as in Holland: Here we had the $ncou$h M$&s;ick of the Bittern, a B$$d $ormerly counted ominous and pre&s;a ing, $nd who, as Fame tells us, (but as I be|$eve no body knows) thru&s;ts its Bill into Reed, and then gives the dull, heavy $roan or Sound, like a Sigh, which it $es &s;o $oud, that with a deep Ba&s;e, like $e Sound of a Gun at a great Di&s;tance, $s heard two or three Mile, (&s;ay the $word$) $ut perhaps not quite &s;o far.</P>
<P>H$re we fir&s;t &s;aw Bo&s;ton, a hand&s;ome $word$ built Sea Port Town, at the Mouth $word$ the River Wi$$ham. The Tower of $is Church is without que&s;tion, the $word$ and highe&s;t in England; and, as &s;tands in a Country, which (they &s;ay) $word$ no Bottom, nothing is more &s;trange, $word$ that they &s;hould find a Foundation $word$ &s;o noble and lofty a Structure; it has $word$ Spire, or Pinnacle on the $word$ but it is &s;o very high, that few $word$ in England can match it, and is not $word$ beautiful, by Land, but is very $span$ Sea to guide Pilots into that Port, and even into the Mouth of the River Ou&s;e; for in clear Weather 'tis &s;een quite out at Sea to the Entrance of tho&s;e Chan|nels, which they call Lynn Deeps, and Bo&s;ton Deeps, which are as difficult Places as mo&s;t upon the whole Ea&s;tern Shore of Britain.</P>
<P>The Town of Bo&s;ton is a large, po|pulous, and well built Town, full of good Merchants, and has a good Share of fo|reign Trade, as well a$ Lynn. Here is held one of tho&s;e annual Fairs, which pre&s;erve the an$$$nt $word$ of a Mart, whereof I remember only four in England of any con&s;iderable $word$ viz. Lynn, Gainsbor|ough, and $span$,</P>
<P>The $word$ $word$ this Place is all $word$ and $span$ the Land very rich, and $word$ $word$ $word$ Num|bers $span$ Sheep, and al&s;o Oxen of the $span$ Overplus and be&s;t of $span$ London Market; and $span$ as al&s;o from the Downs $span$ above mentioned, comes the gr $word$ Part of the Wool, known, as a Di&s;tinction for its Credit, becau&s;e of its Finene&s;s, by the Name of Lincoln&s;hire Woo$; which is &s;ent in great Quantities into No folk and S$$$o$k, for the Manu|facturers of tho&s;e $word$ and indeed to &s;everal other of the mo&s;t trading Countries in England.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fens are indeed very con&s;iderable for their Extent&punc; for they reach in $span$ in &s;ome Places fifty Miles, and in Breadth above thirty: And as they are &s;o level that there is no Interruption to the &s;ight, any Building of extraordinary hight is &s;een a long Way, for Example, Bo&s;ton Steeple is &s;een upon Lincoln Heath near thirty Miles, Peterborough and Ely Min&s;ters are &s;een almo&s;t throughout the whole Level, &s;o are the Spires of Lynn, Whittle$ea, and Crowland&punc; &s;een at a very great Di&s;t|ance, which $word$ a Beauty to the Coun|try.</P>
<P>From Bo&s;ton we came on through the $word$ Country to Spa$ling, which is ano|ther Sea Port in the Level, but &s;tanding far within the Land on the River Wel|land. Here was nothing very remarkable
<PB REF="316">
to be &s;een as to Antiquity, but the Ru|ins of an old famous Mona&s;try, of which the Mona&s;ticon gives a particular De|&s;cription. There is a Bridge over the Welland, and Ve&s;&s;els of about fifty or &s;ixty Ton may come up to the Town, and that is &s;ufficient for the Trade of Spalding, which is chiefly in Corn and Coal.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not pa&s;s by Crowland, an|o her Place of great religious Antiquity, her being once a famous Mona&s;tery, the Remains of which are &s;till to be &s;een: The Monks of Crowland were eminent in Hi&s;tory, and a great many Stories are told of the Devils of Crowland al|&s;o, and what Conver&s;ation they had with the Monks, which Tales are more out of Date, than they were formerly; for they tell us, that in ancient Times tho&s;e Things were as certainly believ'd for Truths, as if they had been before their Faces.</P>
<P>There is one Thing here that is cu|rious indeed, and very remarkable, and which is not to be &s;een in any other Place in Britain, if it be in Europe; namely, a triangular Bridge: The Ca&s;e is this: The River Welland and another River, or rather a Branch from the River Nyne, joining together ju&s;t at Crowland, and the Bridge being fixed at the very Point where they join, &s;tands upon a Center in the middle of the united Waters, and then parting into two Bridges, lands you one to the Right upon Thornsby, and one to the Le&s;t upon Holland; and yet they tell us there is a Whirpool, or bottomle&s;s Pit, in the Middle too; but that Part I &s;ee no rea&s;on to give Credit to.</P>
<P>The Town of Spalding is not large, but pretty well built and well inhabited; but for the Healthyne&s;s or Plea&s;antne&s;s of it, I have no more to &s;ay than this, that I was very glad when I got out of it, and out of the re&s;t of the Fen Country; for 'tis a horrid Air for a Stranger to breathe in.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the Draining tho&s;e Fens, by a &s;et of Gentlemen call'd the Adventurers, the &s;everal Laws for &s;ecur|ing and pre&s;erving the Banks, and divid|ing the Lands; how they were by the extraordinary Conflux of Waters from all the Inland Counties of England fre|quently overflow'd, and &s;ometimes lay under Water mo&s;t Part of the Year; how all the Water in this Part of England, which does not run into the Thames, the Trent, or the Severn, falls together into the&s;e low Grounds, and empty them&s;elves into the Sea by tho&s;e Drains, as thro' a Sink; and how by the Skill of the&s;e Adventurers, and, at a prodigious Ex|pence, they have cut new Channels, and even whole Rivers, with particular Drains from one River to another, to carry off the great Flux of Waters, when Floods or Fre&s;hes came down either on one &s;ide or on the other; and how notwith&s;tand|ing all that Hands could do, or Art con|trive, yet &s;ometimes the Waters do &s;till prevail, the Banks break, and whole Le|vels are overflow'd together; all this, tho' it would be very u&s;eful and agreeable to have it fully and Geographically describ'd, yet it would take up &s;o much Room, and be &s;o tedious here, where you are expect|ing a &s;ummary De&s;cription of Things, rather than the Hi&s;tory and Rea&s;ons of them, that I cannot think of entering any farther into it.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that the&s;e Fens of Lincoln&s;hire are of the &s;ame Kind with, and contiguous to tho&s;e already mentioned in the $word$ of Ely, in the Counties of Cambridge and Huntington, and tha$ here, as well as there, we &s;ee innumer|able Numbers of Cattle, which are fed up to an extraordinary Size by the Richne&s;s of the Soil.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o an infinite Number o$ wild Fowl, &s;uch as Duck and Maliard Teal and Widgeon, Brand Gee&s;e, wild Gee&s;e, &amp;c. and for the taking of the $word$ fir&s;t Kinds, here are a great Number o$ Decoys or Duckoys, call them which yo$ plea&s;e, from all which the va&s;t Numbe$ of Fowls they take are &s;ent up to London the Quantity indeed is incredible, and th$
<PB REF="317">
Accounts which the Country People give of the Numbers they &s;ometimes take, are &s;uch, that one &s;carce dare re|port it from them. But this I can &s;ay, of my certain Knowledge, that &s;ome of the&s;e Decoys are of &s;o great an Extent, and take &s;uch great Quantities of Fowl, that they are let for great &s;ums of money by the Year, viz. from 100 <HI>l.</HI> to 3, 4, and 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year Rent.</P>
<P>The Art of taking the Fowls&punc; and e&s;pecially of Breeding up a Set of Crea|tures. call'd Decoy Ducks, to entice and then betray their Fellow Ducks into the &s;everal Decoys, is very admirable indeed, and de&s;erves a De&s;cription; tho' 'tis not very ea&s;y to de&s;cribe it, take it in as few as I can.</P>
<P>The Decoy Ducks are fir&s;t naturalized to the Place, for they are hatch'd and bred up in the Decoy Ponds: There are in the Ponds certain Places where they are con&s;tantly fed&punc; and where being made tame, they are u&s;ed to come even to the Decoy Man's Hand for their Food.</P>
<P>When they fly abroad, or, as might be &s;aid, are &s;ent abroad, they go none knows where; but 'tis believ'd by &s;ome they fly quite over the Seas into Hol|land and Germany; there they meet with others of their Acquaintance&punc; that is to &s;ay, of their own Kind, where &s;orting with them, and ob&s;erving how poorly they live, how all the Rivers are frozen up, and the Lands cover'd with Snow, and that they are almo&s;t &s;tarv'd, they $ail not to let them know, (in Language that they make one under&s;tand) that in England, from whence they came, the $a$e is quite alter'd; that the Engli&s;h Ducks live much better than they do in tho&s;e cold Climates; that they have open Lakes, and Sea Shores full of Food, the Tides flowing freely into every Creek; that they have al&s;o within the Land, large Lakes, refre&s;hing Springs of Water, open Ponds, covered and &s;ecured from human Eyes, with large Rows of grown Trees and impenetrable Groves; that the Lands are full of Food, the Stubbles yielding con&s;tant &s;upplies of Corn, left by the negligent Husbandmen, as it were on purpo&s;e for their U&s;e, that 'tis not once in a wild Duck's Age, that they have any long Fro&s;ts or deep Snows, and that when they have, yet the Sea is ne|ver frozen, or the Shores void of Food; and that if they will plea&s;e but to go with them into England; they &s;hall &s;hare with them in all the&s;e good Things.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Repre&s;entations, made in their own Duck Language, (or by whatever other Arts which we know not) they draw together a va&s;t Number of the Fowls, and, in a Word, Kidnap them from their own Country; for being once brought out of their Knowledge, they follow the Decoys, as a Dog follows the Hunt&s;man&punc; and 'tis frequent to &s;ee the&s;e &s;ubtle Crea|tures return with a va&s;t Flight of Fowls with them, or at their Heels, as we may &s;ay, after the &s;aid Decoy Ducks have been ab&s;ent &s;everal Weeks together.</P>
<P>When they have brought them over, the fir&s;t Thing they do is to &s;ettle with them in the Decoy Ponds, to which they (the Decoy Ducks) belong: Here they chatter and gabble to them, in their own Language, as if they were telling them, that the&s;e are the Ponds they told them of, and here they &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee how well they &s;hould live, how &s;ecure and how &s;afe a Retreat they had here.</P>
<P>When the Decoy men perceive they are come, and that they are gathering and encrea&s;ing, they fail not to go &s;e|cretly to the Pond's &s;ide, I &s;ay &s;ecretly, and under the Cover which they have made with Reeds, &s;o that they cannot be &s;een, where they throw over the Reeds Handfuls of Corn, in &s;hallow Pla|ces, &s;uch were the Decoy Ducks are u|&s;ually fed&punc; and where they are &s;ure to come for it, and to bring their new Gue&s;ts with them for their Entertainment.</P>
<P>This they do $or two or three Days to|gether, and no harm follows, 'till throw|ing in this Bait one Time in an open wide
<PB REF="318">
Place&punc; another Time in another open wide Place, the third Time it is thrown in a narrower Place; that is to &s;ay, where the Trees&punc; which hung over the Water and the Banks, &s;tand nearer, and then in another yet narrower, where the &s;aid Trees are over head like an Arbour, tho' at a good Hight from the Water.</P>
<P>Here the Boughs are &s;o artfully manag|ed, that a large Net is &s;pread near the Tops of the Trees among the Branches&punc; and fa&s;ten'd to Hoops which $word$ $word$ Side to Side: This is &s;o high and &s;o wide, and the Room is &s;o much below, and the Water &s;o open&punc; that the Fowls do not perceive the N$t above them at all.</P>
<P>Here the Decoy man keeping un&s;een, behind the Hedges of Reeds, which are made perfectly clo&s;e, goes forward, throw|ing Corn over the Reeds into the Water; the Decoy Ducks greedily fall upon it, and calling the$ foreign Gue&s;ts, &s;eem to tell them, that now they may find their Words good and how well the Ducks live in England; &s;o inviting or rather wheedling them forward, 'till by Degrees they are all gotten under the Arch or Sweep of the Net, which is on the Trees, and which by Degrees, imperceptibly to them&punc; declines lower and lower, and al|&s;o narrower and narrower, 'till at the far|ther End it comes to a Point like a Pur&s;e; though this farther End is quite out of Sight, and perhaps two or three hundred Yards from the fir&s;t Entrance.</P>
<P>When the whole Quantity are thus greedily following the Leading Ducks or Decoys, and feeding plentifully as they go; and the Decoy man &s;ees they are all within the Arch of the Net and &s;o far with|in as not to be able to e&s;cape, on a &s;udden a Dog, which 'till then he keeps clo&s;e by him, and who is perfectly taught his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s. ru&s;hes from behind the Reeds, and jumps into the Water, &s;wimming directly after the Ducks, and (terribly to them) Barking as he &s;wims.</P>
<P>Immediately the Ducks (frighted to the la&s;t Degree) ri&s;e upon the Wing to make their E&s;cape, but to their great Surprize, are beaten down again by the arched Net, which is $ver their Heads: Being then forced into the Water, they nece&s;&s;arily &s;wim forward, for fear of that terrible Creature the Dog; and thus they crowd on, 'till by Degrees the Net growing lower and narrower, as is &s;aid, they are hurried to the very farther End, where another Decoy-man &s;tands ready to receive them, and who takes them out alive with his Hands.</P>
<P>As for the Traytors, that drew the poor Ducks into this Snare, they are taught to ri&s;e but a little Way, and to not reaching to the Net, they fly back to the Ponds, and make their E&s;cape; or el&s;e, being u&s;ed to the Decoy-man, they go to him fearle&s;s, and are taken out as the re&s;t; but in&s;tead of being kill'd with them, are strok'd, made much of, and put into a little Pond ju&s;t by him, and $ed and made much of for their Services.</P>
<P>There are many Particulars in the man|aging and draining the&s;e Levels, th$$w|ing off the Water by Mills and Engines, and cultivating the Grounds in an unu&s;ual Man$$r, which would be very u&s;eful to be de&s;crib'd; but the needful Brevity of this Work will not admit of it: yet &s;ome|thing may be touch'd at.</P>
<P N="1">1. That here are &s;ome wonderful En|gines for throwing up Water, and &s;uch as are not to be &s;e$n any where el&s;e, whereof one in particular throw up, (as they a&s;&s;ured us) twelve hun|dred $on of Water in half an Hour, and goes by Wind Sail$ 12 Wings or Soils to a Mill: This I &s;aw the Model of, but I mu&s;t own I did not &s;ee it perform.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here are the greate&s;t Improvements by planting of Hemp, that, I think, is to be &s;een in England; particular|ly on the Norfolk and Cambridge S$de of the Fens, as about Wisbech, Well, and &s;everal other Places, where we &s;aw many hundred Acres of Ground bearing great Crops of Hemp.</P>
<P N="3">3 Here is a particular Trade carry'd on with London, which is no where
<PB REF="319">
el&s;e practi&s;ed in the whole Kingdom, that I have met with, or heard of, (viz.) For carrying Fi&s;h alive by Land Carriage; this they do by car|rying great Buts fill'd with Water in Waggons as the Carriers draw other Goods: The Buts have a little &s;quare Flap, in&s;tead of a Bung, about ten, twelve, or fourteen Inches &s;quare, which, being open'd, gives Air to the Fi&s;h, and every Night, when they come to the Inn, they draw off the Water, and let more fre&s;h and &s;weet Water run into them again. In the&s;e Carriages they chiefly carry Tench and Pike, Pea$ch and Eels, but e&s;pe|cially Tench and Pike, of which here are &s;ome of the large&s;t in England.</P>
<P>Whittle&s;ea and Ram&s;ey Meres are two $akes, made by the River Nyne or Nene, which runs through them; the fir&s;t is be|tween five and &s;ix Mile long, and three or four Miles broad, and is indeed full of excellent Fi&s;h for this Trade.</P>
<P>From the Fenns, longing to be deliver|ed from Fogs and &s;tagnate Air, and the Water of the Colour of brew'd Ale, like the Rivers of the Peak, we fir&s;t &s;et Foot $n dry Land, as I call'd it, at Peterbor|$ugh.</P>
<P>This is a little City, and indeed 'tis the ea&s;t in England; for Bath, or Wells, or $ly, or Carli&s;le, which are all called $ities, are yet much bigger; yet Peter|$orough is contemptible Place neither; here are &s;ome good Hou&s;es in it, and the $treets are fair and well built; but the $lory of Peterborough is the Cathedral, which is truly fine and beat$$$ful; the $uilding appears to be more modren, $han the Story of the rai&s;ing this Pile $plies; and it wants only a fine Tower $eeple, and a Spire on the Top of it, as $t. Paul's at London had, or as Salisbury $ll has; I &s;ay, it wants this only to $ake it the fine&s;t Cathedral in Britain, ex|$pt St. Paul's, which is quite new, and $word$ Church of St Peter at York.</P>
<P>In this Church was bury'd the Body of $e unhappy Mary Queen of Scots, Mo|ther to King James the Fir&s;t, who was be|headed not far off in Fotheringay Ca&s;tle in the &s;ame County, but her Body was afterwards removed by King James the Fir&s;t, her Son, into We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, where a Monument is erected for her, in King Henry the VIIth's Chappel; tho' &s;o$e do not &s;$ick to tell us, that tho' the Monument was erected, the Body was never remov'd.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o lies interred another unhappy Queen, namely, the Lady Katharine of Spain, the d$vorc'd Wi&s;e of King Henry VIII. and Mother to Queen Mary: who reigned immediately after King Edward VI. Her Monument is not very magni|ficent, but 'tis far from mean. Here is an old decay'd Monument of Bi&s;hip Wul&s;er, the Founder of the Church; but this Church has &s;o often been burnt and de|moli&s;hed, &s;ince that Time, that 'tis doubt|ful when they &s;hew it you, whether it be authentick o$ n$t.</P>
<P>The Chappel here, call'd St. Mary's, is a very curious Building, tho' now not in u&s;e the Choir has been often repair'd g$d beautify'd, and is now very fine; but the We&s;t End, or great Gate, is a Prodi|gy for its Beauty and Variety. 'Tis re|markable, that as this Church, when a Mona&s;try, was famous for its great Re|venues, &s;o now, as reduced, 'tis one of the poore&s;t Bi&s;hopricks in England, if not the meane&s;t.</P>
<P>Coming to this little City landed us in Northampton&s;hire; but as great Part of Lincoln&s;hire, which is a va&s;tly extended large County, remain'd yet un&s;$$$ we were obliged to turn North from Peterbo|rough, and take a View of the Fens again, though we kept them at &s;ome Di&s;tance too Here we pa&s;s'd the Welland at Market Deeping, an old, ill built and dirty Town; then we went through Bourn to Folkingham, near which we &s;ay two Pieces of decay'd Magnificence; one was the old d$m$li&s;hed Mona&s;try of S$$|pringham, the Seat of the Gilbertine Nuns, &s;o famous for Au&s;terity, and the &s;evere&s;t Rules, that any other religious Order have yielded to, and the other was the antient
<PB REF="320">
Hou&s;e of the Lord Clinton. Queen Eli|zabeth's Admiral, where that great and noble Per&s;on once liv'd in the utmo&s;t Splendor and Magnificence; the Hou&s;e, tho' in its full decay, &s;hows what it has been, and the Plai&s;ter of the Clelings and Walls in &s;ome Rooms is &s;o fine, &s;o f$$m, and &s;o entire, that they break it off in large Flakes, and it will bear Writing on it with a Pencil or Steel Pen, like the Leaves of a Table Book. This &s;ort of Plai&s;ter I have not &s;een any where &s;o very fine, except in the Palace of None|&s;uch in Surrey near Ep&s;om, before it was demoli&s;h'd by the Lord Berkeley.</P>
<P>From hence we cro&s;s'd Part of the great Heath mentioned before, and came into the high Road again at Anca&s;ter, a &s;mall but ancient Roman Village, and full of Remnants of Antiquity: This Town gives now the Title of Duke to the an|cient Family of Lind&s;ey, now Dukes of Anca&s;ter, formerly only Earls of Lind+&s;ey, and hereditary Lords Chamberlains of England.</P>
<P>This Place and Panton, a Village near it, would afford great Subject of Di&s;|cour&s;e, if Antiquity was my pre&s;ent Pro|vince, for here are found abundance of Roman Coins, Urns, and other Remains of Antiquity, as al&s;o in &s;everal Parts here|about; and Mr. Cambden puts it out of Doubt, that at this Town of Anca&s;ter there was a Station or Colony &s;ettled of Ro|mans, which afterwards &s;well'd up into a City, but is now &s;unk again out of Know|ledge</P>
<P>From hence we came to Grantham, famous for a very fine Church and a Spire Steeple &s;o &s;inely built, and &s;o very high, that I do not know many higher and finer built in Britain. The vulgar Opinion, that this Steeple &s;tands leaning, is certainly a vulgar Error: I had no In&s;trument indeed to judge it by, but, according to the &s;tric|re&s;t Ob&s;ervation, I could not perceive it, or any thing like it, and am much of O|pinion with that excellent Poet:</P>
<P>'Tis Hight makes <HI>Grantham</HI> Steeple &s;tand awry.</P>
<P>This is a neat, plea&s;ant, well-built and populous Town, has a good Market, and the Inhabitants are &s;aid to have a very good Trade, and are generally rich There is also a very good Free School here. This Town lying on the great Northern Road is famous, as well as Stain$ord, for abundance of very good Inns, &s;ome of them fit to entertain Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality and their Retinues, and it is a great Advantage to the Place.</P>
<P>From a Hill, about a Mile beyond this Town North We&s;t, being on the great York Road, we had a Pro&s;pect again into the Vale of Bever, or Belvoir, which I mentioned before; and which &s;preads it&s;elf here into three Countries, to wit, Lincoln, Leice&s;ter, and Rutland&s;hires: Al&s;o here we had a di&s;tant View of Be|ver, or Bellevoir Ca&s;tle, which 'tis &s;up|po&s;ed took its Name from the Situation, from whence there is &s;o fine a Pro&s;pect, of Bellevoir over the Country; &s;o that you &s;ee from the Hill into &s;ix Countries, namely, into Lincoln, Nottingham, Dat by, Leice&s;ter, Rutland, and Northamp|ton Shires. The Ca&s;tle or Palace (for &s;uch it now is) of Bevoir, is now the Seat of the Noble Family of Manners&punc; Dukes of Rutland, who have al&s;o a very noble E&s;tate, equal to the Deme&s;nes of &s;ome Sovereign Princes, and extending it&s;elf into Nottingham and Datby$are far and wide, and in which E&s;tate they have an immen&s;e &s;ubterranean Trea&s;ure, never to be exhau&s;ted; I mean the Lead Mines and Coal-Pits, of which I &s;hall by more in its Place.</P>
<P>Turning Southward from hence we enter'd Rutland&s;hire, remarkable for be|ing the lea&s;t County in England, having but two Market Towns in it, viz. Oke|ham and U$pingham, but famous for|abundance of fine Seats of the Gentle|men, and &s;ome of the fir&s;t Rank; as par|ticularly the Earls of Gains borough and
<PB REF="321">
Nottingham; the latter has at a very great Expence, and &s;ome Years Labour, $ebuilt the ancient Seat of Burleigh on the Hill, near Okeham, and on the edge of the Vale of Cathro&s;s. This Hou&s;e would indeed require a Volume of it&s;elf, to de&s;cribe the plea&s;ant &s;ituation, and magnificent Structure, the fine&s;t Gardens, the perfectly will&punc;fini&s;h'd Apartments, the curious Paintings, and well-&s;tor'd Li|brary: All the&s;e merit a particular View, and con&s;equently an exact De&s;cription; $ut it is not the Work of a few Pages, and it would be to le&s;&s;en the Fame of this Palace, to &s;ay any thing by way of Ab|&s;tract where every Part calls for a full Account: At pre&s;ent, all I can &s;ay of it is, there may be &s;ome extraordinary Palaces in England, where there are &s;o many fine ones, I &s;ay there may be &s;ome that excell in this or that Particular, but I do not a Hou&s;e in Britain, which excels all the re&s;t in &s;o many Particulars, or that goes &s;o near to excelling them all in every thing.

<P>From hence we came to Stamford; $e Town is placed in a Kind of an An|$ of the County of Lincoln, ju&s;t upon $e Edge of three Counties, viz. Lincoln, $rthampton, and Rutland: This Town $a&s;ts greatly too of its Antiquity, and $deed it has evident Marks of its ha|$ng been a very great Place in former $ys.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory tells us it was burnt by the $nes above 1500 Years ago, being then $l$uri&s;hing City: Tradition tells us, it was once a University, and that the Schools were fir&s;t erected by Bladud King of the Britains; the &s;ame who&s;e Figure &s;tands up at the King's Bath in the City of Bath, and who liv'd 300 Years before our Saviour's Time: But the famous Camps and military Ways, which &s;till appear at and near this Town, are a more vi&s;ible Te&s;timony of its having been a very an|cient Town, end that it was con&s;ider|able in the Romans Time.</P>
<P><PB REF="322">
It is at this Time a very fair, well|built, con&s;iderable and wealthy Town, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix Pari&s;hes, including that of St. Martin in Stamford Baron; that is to &s;ay, in that Part of the Town which &s;tands over the River, which, tho' it is not a Part, of the Town, critically &s;peak|ing, being not in the Liberty, and in ano|ther County, yet 'tis called Stamford, and is $ated with it in the Taxes, and the like.</P>
<P>This Town is the Property, as it may be called, of the Earles of Exce&s;ter; for the Author of the Survey of Stamford, Page 15 &s;ays, William, Cecil, Baron Bur|leigh, and afterwards Earl of Exce&s;ter, obtained the Fee Farm of Queen Eliza|beth for him&s;elf, in who&s;e Po&s;terity it yet remains.</P>
<P>The Government of this Town is not, it &s;eems, as mo&s;t Towns of &s;uch Note are, by a Mayor and Aldermen, but by an Alderman, who is chief Magi&s;trate, and twelve Comburge&s;&s;es, and twenty four capitual Burge&s;&s;es, which, abating their Wor&s;hips Titles, is, to me, much the &s;ame Thing as a Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council.</P>
<P>They boa&s;t in this Town of very great Privileges, e&s;pecially to their Alderman, who is their chief Magi&s;trate, and his Comburge&s;&s;es; &s;uch as being freed from the Sheriffs Juri&s;diction, and from being empannel'p on Juries out of the Town; to have the Return of all Writs, to be freed from all Lords Lieutenants and from their Mu&s;ters, and for having the Militia of the Town commanded by their own Officers, the Alderman being the King's Lord Lieutenant, and immediately under his Maje&s;ty's Command, and to be (within the Liberties and Juri&s;diction of the Town) e&s;teemed the &s;econd Man in the Kingdom; and the Grant of tho&s;e Privilieges concludes thus; Ut ab antiquo u&s;u fuerunt, as of antient Time they had been accu&s;tomed: So that this Charter, which was granted by Edward IV. Ann. 1461. &s;eems to be only a Confirmation of former Privileges, not a Grant of new ones.</P>
<P>In the Church of St Martin in St$$|ford&punc;Baron, that is on this Side the Bridge at the upper End of the Choir, $word$ a very noble Monument of William $word$ Lord Burleigh, who lies bu$y'd there $word$ a large Vault ju&s;t under it; and opposite to it, on the North Side, is a more antient (but hand&s;ome) Monument, tho' not $o magnificent as the former, being in Me|mory of Richard Cecil, E&s;q; and Ja$e his Wife, the Father and Mother of the &s;aid famous Lord Burleigh; al&s;o a more modern Monument for the great Earl $word$ re-edifyed the Hou&s;e, being the la&s;t $word$ but one, and Father of the pre&s;ent Earl; and for his Counte&s;s, a Si&s;ter of the pre|&s;ent Duke of Devon&s;hire: This is a fini&s;h|ed Piece, 'tis all of the fine&s;t Marble, and&punc; they told us, it was made at Florence&punc; and &s;ent over: They &s;aid Earl dy'd on his Travels at Paris.</P>
<P>There is a very fine Stone Bridge over the River Welland of five Arches, and the Town-Hall is in the upper Part of the Gate, upon or at the End of the Bridge, which is a very hand&s;ome Building. There are two con&s;tant Weekly Markets here, viz. on Mondays and Fridays, but the la&s;t is the chief Market&punc; They have al&s;o three Fairs, viz. St. Simon and Jude, St James's, and Green&punc;goo&s;e Fair, and a great Midlent Mart; but the latter is not now &s;o con&s;iderable, as it is reported to have formerly been.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of Stamford is $word$ Neighbourhood of the noble Palace $word$ $word$ Earl of Exce&s;ter, called Burleigh Hou&s;e, built by the famous Sir William $word$ Lord Burleigh, and Lord High Trea&s;urer to Queen Elizabeth, the &s;ame who&s;e Mo|nument I ju&s;t now mentioned, being in St. Martin's Church at Stamford&punc;Baron, ju&s;t without the Park.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e, built all of Free &s;tone, looks more like a Town than a Hou&s;e, at which Avenue &s;oever you come to it; the Towers and the Pinnacles &s;o high, and placed at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from one another, look like &s;o many di&s;tant Pari&s;h-Churches in a great Town, and a large
<PB REF="323">
Spire covered with Lead, over the great Cloek in the Center, looks like the Ca|$hedral, or chief Church of the Town.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e &s;tands on an Eminence, which ri&s;es from the North Entrance of the Park, coming from Stamford: On $he other Side, viz. South and We&s;t, the Country lies on a Level with the Hou&s;e, $nd as a fine Plain, with Po&s;ts and other Marks for Hor&s;e-Races; As the Entrance $o$ks towards the &s;lat low Grounds of $incoln&s;hire, it gives the Hou&s;e a mo&s;t $xtraordinary Pro&s;pect into the Fens, &s;o $hat you may &s;ee from thence twenty or $ear thirty Miles, without any thing to $tercept the Sight.</P>
<P>As you mount the Hill, you come to fine E&s;planade&punc; before the great Gate or $word$ Entrance of the Hou&s;e, $here there $word$ a &s;mall but very hand&s;ome Semi circle, $word$ in with an Iron Balu&s;trade, and from $word$ r &s;ing a few Steps, you enter a mo&s;t $word$ Hall, but made infinitely more $word$ by the invaluable Paintings, with $hich it is &s;o fill'd, that there is not $word$ to place any Thing between th$m.</P>
<P>The i$ $ Earl of Exce&s;ter, Father of $word$ $word$ Lord&s;hip, had a great Genius $word$ $word$ ard Architecture, and a $span$ in both&punc; as every Part of $span$ $word$ will te&s;tify; for he $word$ the whole Face of the Building; $word$ down great Part of the Front $span$ Garden and turned the old $word$ Windows i$ to tho&s;e &s;pacious Sa&s;hes $word$ are $word$ $$en there; and tho' the $span$ fir&s;t Builder, who had an ex|$&s;ite $word$ al&s;o, (as the manner o$ build|s then was) had $o well ordered the $word$ and Avenues of the whole Fabrick, $word$ nothing was wanting of that Kind, had al&s;o contriv'd the hou&s;e it&s;elf in a $word$ magnificent manner; the Rooms $word$ well directed, the Ci$lings lofty, $word$ he Decorations ju&s;t, yet the late Earl $word$ Room for Alterntio$s, infinitely to Advantages of the whole; as $word$ a noble Stair Ca&s;e, a whole &s;et of Apartments, with Rooms of State, $word$ for the Entertainment of a Prince, e&s;pecially tho&s;e on the Garden &s;ide; tho&punc; at pre&s;ent a little out of Repair again.</P>
<P>As this admirable Genius, the late Earl, lov'd paintings, &s;o he had infinite Advan|tage in procuring them; for he not only travil'd three times into Italy, and &s;tay d every time a con&s;iderable while at Flor|ence, but he was &s;o entertain'd at the Court of Tulcany, and had, by his mo&s;t Prince|ly Deportment and excellent Accompli&s;h|ments, &s;o for obtain'd upon the Great Duke, that he might be &s;aid indeed to love him, and his Highne&s;s &s;new'd the Earl ma|ny ways that E&s;teem&punc; and more particu|larly, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to purcha&s;e many ex|cellent Pieces at rea&s;onable Prices; and not only &s;o, but his Highne&s;s pre&s;ented him with &s;everal Pieces of great Value.</P>
<P>Among the $e&s;t, there is, in the great Hall, his Lord$$$p's Picture, on $word$ done by the G$ea: Duke's principal painter, at his Highne&s;s's charge&punc; and given to his Lord&s;hip, as a Mark of the Great Duke's &s;pecial Favour: There is al&s;o a fine Piece of Seneca bleeding to Death in the warm Bath, and Dictating his $word$ morals to his Scholars; the Pa&s;&s;ions are in &s;o lively a Manner de&s;cribed in the Scholars, their cager Attention, their generous Regard to their Manner, their vigilant Catching at his Words, and &s;ome of them taking Minutes, that it is indeed admirable and inexpre&s;&s;ible. I have been told, that the King of France offer'd the Earl 6000 Pi&s;toles for it.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to give a Detail of the fine pieces his Lord&s;hip brought from Italy, all Originals, and by the be&s;t ma|&s;ters; 'tis $$ou$h to &s;ay, they infinitely exceed all that can be &s;een in England, and are of more Value $han the hou&s;e it&s;elf, and all the park belonging to it.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip had indeed infinite Advan|tage, join&punc;d to his very good Judment, be|&s;ides what I have mention'd, at the Court of the Grand Duke, for the furni&s;hing him&s;elf with extraordinary Painting, hav|ing made his three Journeys into Italy by &s;everal Routs, and &s;t$pt at &s;everal Courts of princes; and his Collection would doubt|le&s;s have been &s;till $nlarg'd, had he liv'd to

fini&s;h a fourth Tour, which he was ta|king; but he was &s;urpriz'd with a &s;ud|den and violent Di&s;temper, and Dy'd at Paris (as we were told) of a Dy&s;en|trie.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Pictures, which, as above, were brought from Abroad, the Hou&s;e it&s;elf, at lea&s;t the hew Apartments may be &s;aid to be one entire Picture. The Stair Ca&s;e, the Ceilings of all the fine Lodgings, the Chapel, the Hall, the late Earl's Clo&s;et, are all finely painted by VARRIO, of who&s;e Work I need &s;ay no more than this, that the Earl kept him twelve Years in his Family, wholly em|ploy'd in Painting tho&s;e Cielings and Stair Ca&s;es. &amp;c. and allow'd him a Coach and Hor&s;es, and Equipage&punc; a Table, and Servants and a very con&s;iderable Pen$$on.</P>
<P>N. B. "The Character this Gentleman <Q>&startq;&endq;left behind him at this Town, is, that he deferv'd it all for his Paint|ings; but for nothing el&s;e; his &s;can|dalous Life, and his unpaid Debts, it &s;eems, cau&s;ing him to be but very meanly &s;poken of in the Town of Stamford.</Q></P>
<P>I might dwell a long while upon this Subject, and could do it with great Plea|&s;ure, Burleigh Hou&s;e being well worth a full and compleat De&s;cription; but this Work will not admit of Enlargements.</P>
<P>By the Park Wall, or, as &s;ome think, through the Park, adjoining to Burleigh Hou&s;e, pa&s;s'd an old Roman Highway, beginning at Ca&s;tor, a little Village near Peterborough; but which was anciently a Roman Station, or Colony, call'd Du|robrevum; this way is &s;till to be &s;een, and is now call'd The 40 Foot Way, pa&s;&s;ing from Gunworth Ferry (and Pe|terborough) to Stamford: This was, as the Antiquaries are of Opinion, the Great Road into the North, which is &s;ince turn'd from Stilton in Huntingdon&s;hire to Wand&s;worth or Wandsword, where there is a very good Bridge over the Ri|ver Nyne; which coming down from Northampton, as I have ob&s;erv'd $word$ pa&s;&s;es thence by Peterbo$ough&punc; and $word$ into the Fen Country: But if I may &s;traggle a little into Antiquity, ($word$ I have &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided) I am of O+pinion, neither this or Wansford $word$ the ancient Northern Road in u&s;e by the Romans; for 'tis evident, that $word$ great Roman Cau&s;way is &s;till &s;een on $word$ left Hand of that Road, and pa&s;&s;ing $word$ Nyne at a Place call'd Water $word$ went directly to Stamford, and pa&s;s'd $word$ Welland, ju&s;t above that Town, $span$ the Place where the Bridge &s;tands $span$ and this Roman way is &s;till to be $word$ both on the South and the North $span$ the Welland, &s;tretching it&s;elf on to $word$ Ca&s;terton, a little Town upon the $word$ Gua&s;h, about three Miles beyond $word$ which was, as all Writers agree&punc; another Roman Station, and was $word$ Gua&s;ennae by the Antients, from when$$ the River is &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o to take $word$ Name; whence it went on to Panton&punc; another very con&s;iderable Colony, and &s;o to Newark, where it cro&s;s'd the Fo&s;s.</P>
<P>This Forty Foot Way then mu&s;t be a cro&s;s Road from Ca&s;tor, and by th$$ from the Fen Country, &s;o leading into the great Highway at Stamford; as like|wi&s;e another Cro&s;s Road went out of the &s;aid Great Road at Panton, above named, to Anca&s;ter, where was a Roman Cohort plac'd, and thence join'd the $word$ again at Lincoln.</P>
<P>Near this liitle Village of Ca&s;tor lives the Lord Fitz Williams, of an ancient Family, tho' an Iri&s;h Title, and his Lord|&s;hip has lately built a very fine Stone Bridge over the River Nyne, near Gun|worth, where formerly was the Ferry</P>
<P>I was very much applauding this ge|nerous Action of my Lord's, knowing the Inconvenience of the Pa&s;&s;age there before, e&s;pecially if the Waters of the Nyne were but a little &s;welled, and I thought it a piece of Publick Charity&punc; but my Applau&s;e was much abated, when coming to pa&s;s the Bridge (being in $word$

<P>As we pa&s;s by Burghleigh Park Wall, $n the Great Road, we &s;ee on the We&s;t $ide, not above half a mile from it, a|$other Hou&s;e&punc; built by the &s;ame Lord $word$ and which might pa&s;s for a very $word$ $word$ were not Burghley by.

This Saying is indeed $span$ the noble Founder, but I $span$ $nowledge, I think it too haughty $span$ to come from &s;o wife and $word$ a Man.</P>
<P>At O$erton, now called Cherry O$ton, $word$ near G$nwor$h&punc; Ferry, is an old $word$ hou&s;e, formerly belonging to a $word$ ancient and almo&s;t forgotten Race, Family of Great Men, call'd Lovetoft, $ich I named for a particular Rea&s;on. $word$ E&s;tate is now in the Heirs of the $word$ Duke of Newca&s;tle, and the Hou&s;e $word$ neglected. On the other &s;ide of the $er is a fine new built Hou&s;e, all of $word$ po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by Sir Francis St. $word$ Bart. which affords a very $word$ $word$ to Travellers, as they pa&s;s $word$ the Hill beyond Stilton to $word$ bridge. This Wansford has obtain'd $word$ Addition to its Name, from a Story $word$ believed by the Country People, $word$ they will hardly allow any room for $rad$ction; namely, That a great Flood $word$ ha&s;tily down the River Nyne, Haymaking-time, a Country Fellow, $word$ taken up his Lodging on a Cock lay in the Meadow, was driven down Stream in the Night, while he was $&s;leep; and the Hay &s;wimming, and the Fellow &s;leeping&punc; they drove together towards $word$ in the $ens, whence he was $ai$ly going on to the Sea; when be|ing wakened, he was &s;een and taken up by &s;ome Fi&s;hermen, almo&s;t in the open Sea; and being ask'd, who he was? he told them his N$$e, and where he lived? He an&s;wer'd, at Wansford in England: From this Story the Town is called Wan&s;|f rd in England; and we &s;ee at the Great In$, by the South End of the Bridge, the Sign of a Man $word$ on a Co$k $word$ &s;ay and over him written&punc; Wansford in Eng|land.</P>
<P>Coming South from hence we pa&s;&s;ed Stilton, a Town famous for Chee&s;e, which is called our Engli&s;h Parme&s;an, and is brought to Table with the Mites, or Maggots $ound it, &s;o thick, that they bring a Spoon with them for you to eat the Mites with, as you do the Chee&s;e.</P>
<P>Hence we came through Sautrey-lane, a deep De&s;cent between two Hills, in which is Stangate hole, famous for being the mo&s;t noted Robbing-place in all this part of the Country. Hence we pa&s;s'd to Huntington, the County Town, other|wi&s;e not con&s;iderable; it is full of very good Inns, is a &s;trong Pa&s;s upon the Ou&s;e, and in the late times of Rebellion it was e&s;teemed &s;o by both Parties.</P>
<P>Here are the mo&s;t beautiful Meadows on the Banks of the River Ou&s;e, that I think are to be &s;een in any part of Eng|land; and to &s;ee them in the Summer|&s;ea&s;on, covered with &s;uch innumerable Stocks of Cattle and Sheep, is one of the mo&s;t agreeable Sights of its kind in the World.</P>
<P>This Town has nothing remarkable in it; 'tis a long continued Street, pretty well built, has three Pari&s;h Churches, and a pretty good Market-place; but the Bridge, or Bridges rather, and Cau&s;|way over the Ou&s;e is a very great Or|nament to the Place.</P>
<P><PB REF="326">
On the We&s;t Side of this Town, and in View of the plain lower Side of the County, is a noble, tho' ancient Seat, of the Earl of Sandwich, the Gardens very fine and well kept; the Situation &s;eems a little ob$ur'd by the Town of Huntington. In the &s;ame Plain we &s;aw Bugden, a &s;mall Village, in which is remarkable a very plea&s;ant, tho' ancient Hou&s;e or Palace, of the Bi&s;hops of Lincoln: The Hou&s;e and Garden &s;urrounded by a very large and deep Moat of Water; the Hou&s;e is old, but plea&s;ant, the Chappel very pret|ty, tho' &s;mall; there is an Organ painted again&s;t the Wall, but in a &s;eeming Organ|loft, and &s;o properly placed and well painted, that we at fir&s;t believed it really to be an Organ.</P>
<P>Hinchingbrook, another Hou&s;e belong|ing to a noble Family, well known by the &s;ame Title, &s;hews it&s;elf at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from Huntington; and a little Way South &s;tands that mo&s;t nobly &s;ituated and plea|&s;ant Seat of the Duke of Manche&s;ter, cal|led Kin&punc;bolton, or Kimbolton Ca&s;tle, where no Pains or Co&s;t has been &s;par'd to make the mo&s;t beautiful Situation &s;till more beautiful, and to help Nature with Art.</P>
<P>Hence we went a little North to &s;ee Oundle, being told that the famous Drum was to be heard ju&s;t at that Time in the Well; but when we came there, they &s;hew'd us indeed the Well and the Town, but as for the Drum, they could only tell us they heard of it, and that it did Drum; but we could meet with no Per&s;on of &s;ufficient Credit, that would &s;ay &s;eriou&s;ly they had heard it: So we came away di&s;|&s;atisfy'd.</P>
<P>This Town of Oundle is plea&s;anly &s;eat|ed on the River Nyne, of which I have &s;o often &s;poken. There are indeed a Range of eminent Towns upon this Ri|ver; (viz.) Northampton, Wellingborough, Thrap&s;ton, Oundle, Fotheringay, Wands|ford, and Peterborough; at all which, except Peterborough, there are very good Stone Bridges over the River.</P>
<P>Here again there is a mo&s;t beautiful Range of Meadows, and perhaps they are not to be equalled in England for length; they continue uninterrupted $word$ above thirty Miles in length, from Peter borough to Northampton, and $span$ Places, are near two Miles i$ $span$ Land rich, the Gra&s;s &s;ine and good, $word$ the Cattle, which are always $span$ them, Hay-time excepted, $word$</P>
<P>From Oundle we cro&s;s'd the County of Northampton into Bedford&s;hire, and par|ticularly to the Town of B$d$ord&punc; $word$ chief Town of the County; for this County has no City in it, tho' even $word$ Town is larger and more populous, $word$ &s;everal Cities in England, having five $word$ Churches, and a great many, and tho$e wealthy and thriving Inhab $$nts. This is one of the &s;ix Counties, which they &s;ay lie together, and have not one City among them; namly, Huntington, Bed|ford, Bucks, Berks, Hertford, E&s;&s;ex, and Suffolk.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t do a Piece of ju&s;tice to the U&s;age of England in $word$ of Cities, namely, that it is not here $s in France, and Flanders, and Hol$$d, where almo&s;t all their Towns of Note are called Cities, and here the Gentry chief|ly live in tho&s;e Cities, and the Clergy al|&s;o; I mean the Religious Hou&s;es, of $word$ there are great Number&punc; &s;ometimes in one City, which are enough to ma$e a City&punc; where there was none before.</P>
<P>But as we have no Authority&punc; but an$$|ent U&s;age and Cu&s;tom, for the $word$ Places by the Names of Towns $word$ Cities, &s;o &s;ince that $nti$nt U&s;age of Au|thority had the Titles of Places, 'tis $$|&s;ervable &s;ome Places, formerly of $word$ are con&s;iderably decayed, and &s;$arce pre|&s;erve the Face of their ancient Greatne&s;s; as Lincoln, Old Sarum, $word$ $word$ and others; and &s;everal Towns wh$$$ in tho&s;e Times &s;carce de&s;erved the $word$ of Cities, are now, by the Encrea$$ of Commerce and Numbe$s of Inhabitants&punc; become greater, more populous and wealthy, than others, which are called Cities.</P>
<P>Nor is this all, but &s;everal Towns, which Mr. Cambden tells us, were call'd Cities in his Time, are now &s;unk from
<PB REF="327">
$hat Dignity, and are only called Towns, and yet &s;till retain a Greatne&s;s, Wealth, and Populou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uperior to many Ci|$ies, &s;uch as Colche&s;ter, Ip&s;wieh, Shrews|$ury, Cambridge, Stamford, Leice&s;ter, $nd others, which are without all Com|$ari&s;on greater now than Wells, Peterbo|$ough, Ely, or Carli&s;le, and yet have lo&s;t $he $itle of Cities, which the other re|$a$n.</P>
<P>Thus we have at this Time the Towns $f Froom, Taunton, Tiverton, Plymouth, $ortnmouth, and others in the We&s;t, and $he Tow$s of Liverpool, Manche&s;ter, $eds$ Sheffield, Birmingham, Hull, and $$veral others in the North, that are much $ger, richer, and more populous, than $oche&s;ter, Peterborough, Carli&s;le, Bath, $nd even than York it&s;elf, and yet the&s;e $word$ but the Name of Towns, nay even $f Villages, in &s;ome of which the chief|$ Magi&s;trate is but a Con&s;table, as in $a$ch$$$er, for Example.</P>
<P>It is remarkable of Bedford&s;hire, that $word$ a great Part of the County lies on $e North Side of the Ou&s;e; that is to $jay the two whole Hundreds of Stod|$n and Ba$$ord; yet there is not one $word$ Town in all that Side of the Ou&s;e, $t Be$$$rd only.</P>
<P>Another Thing is &s;earce to be equalled $word$ whole I$le of Britain; namely, that $word$ the Ou&s;e, by a long and winding $ute, cuts through the County, and by $word$ long Reachings, &s;o as to make above $yte Miles between Oulney and St. $ots, tho' n$$ above twenty by Land, $t$in in all that Cour&s;e it receives but one $yer into it, namely, the little River $el which falls into the Ou&s;e a little a-$ve Tem$ford.</P>
<P>$word$ as I have &s;aid, is a large, po-$ea and thriving Town, and a plea|$t well built Place; it has five Pari&s;h $$$hes a very &s;ine Stone Bridge over $$a&s;e, and the High Street $span$ very hand&s;ome fair Street, and $ly well-built; and tho' the Town is $word$ upon any of the great Roads in Eng|$d yet it is full of very good Inns, and many of them; and in particular we found very good Entertainment here.</P>
<P>Here is the be&s;t Market for all Sorts of Provi&s;ions, that is to be &s;een at any Country Town in all the&s;e Parts of Eng|land; and this Occa&s;ions, that tho' it is &s;o far from London, yet the Higglers or Carriers buy great Quantities of Provi&s;i|ons here for London Markets; al&s;o here is a very good Trade down the River to Lynn.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a great Corn Market, and great Quantities of corn are bought here, and carryed down by Barges and other Boats to Lynn, where it is again &s;hipp'd, and carryed by Sea to Holland the Soil hereabouts is exceeding rich and fertile, and particularly prodnces great Quantities of the be&s;t Wheat in England, which is carry'd by Waggons $span$ and from the North Part of the C$$nty twenty Miles beyond this&punc; to the Markets of Hitchin and Hert&s;ord, and bought again there, and ground and c$$$yed in the Meal (&s;$$$l by Land) to London.</P>
<P>Indeed the whole Product of this Coun|ty is Corn, that is to &s;ay, Wheat and Malt for London; for here are very few Manufactures, except that of Straw Hats and Bone Lace, of which by it&s;elf: There are but ten Market Towns in the whole County, and yet 'tis not a &s;mall County neither: The Towns are,</P>

<P>The Duke's Hou&s;e, call'd Wooburn Ab|bey, is ju&s;t by the Town, a good old Hou&s;e, but very ancient, &s;pacious and convenient rather than fine, but exceed|ingly plea&s;ant by its Situation; and for the great quantity of Beach Woods which &s;urround the Parts and cover the Hills, and al&s;o for great Woods of Oak too, as rich and valuable, as they are great and magnificent: The very Situation of this Hou&s;e does promi&s;e i &s;elf another Burleigh or Char&s;worth, whenever an Heir comes to enjoy the va&s;t E&s;tate of this Family, who has a Gerius for Building. But at pre&s;ent, as above the Heir is an In&s;ant.</P>
<P>Ampthill is grated like Wooburn; for tho' in it&s;elf, like the other, it is not a con&s;iderable Town, and has no particular Manufacture to enrich it, yet the Neigh|bourhood of that great and noble Family of Bruce Earls of Ailesbury, the very Town is made both rich and honourable: It is however the Misfortune of this no|ble Family, that the pre&s;ent Earl lives a|broad, being Roman; but the next $word$ are in view of recovering the $word$ of that ancient Family. $span$ Seat of the Family is $span$ and is a noble and $span$ tho' not wholly re built, as $span$ tune of many of the Seats $span$ of this Age</P>

<P>As to the Exchange de&s;ign'd to be built, and for which an Act of Parlia|ment actually pa&s;s'd Ann. 1723. it was at fir&s;t intended to be built where the T$l&s;ey now is; but &s;o many Buildings both publick and private (and one Church, namely Chri&s;t Church, at the Corner of Vine-&s;treet&punc; &s;tanding &s;o near, as that they would crowd the place too much, the fir&s;t Mea&s;ures were chang'd, and now the intended Place is the Meal Market, between Vine &s;treet and St. Mary Port, being on the North &s;ide of the Tol&s;ey; but the Citizens do not &s;eem &s;o ha&s;ty to Build, as they were to get the Act of Parliament pa&s;s'd to give them Power to do it.</P>
<P>There are no le&s;s than fifteen Gla&s;s|hou&s;es in Bri&s;tol, which is more than are $n the City of London: They have in|deed a very great Expence of Gla&s;s Bottles: $y &s;ending them fill'd with Beer, Cyder, $nd Wine to the We&s;t Indies, much more $$an goes from London; al&s;o great Num|$ers of Bottles, even &s;uch as is almo&s;t $e edible, are now u&s;ed for &s;ending the Waters of St. Vincent's Rock away, which are now carry'd, not all over Eng|$nd only, but, we may &s;ay, all over the $orld</P>
<P>The Ground is now &s;o rais'd in Queen's $quare (that which was formetly call'd $e Mead) that the highe&s;t Tide does $t flow over it, and all the &s;ides of the $uares are now fully built and inhabited, $cept one Hou&s;e only.</P>
<P>There is in the great Church of Rat|$ff or Redcliff, a very ancient Monu|ment for one Mr. William Cannings, Bur|ge&s;s and Merchant of Bri&s;tol, who be&s;ides Repairing or new Building part of Rat|cliff great Church, gave to the Vicar and Church Wardens, and major part of the inhabitants of the Pari&s;h, in Tru&s;t for the Poor, 340l This was in the Year 1474. 17th of Edw. IV. N. B. <HI>Such a Sum at that Time was equal to eight Times that Money in the&s;e Days.</HI></P>
<P>On one Part of the Monument is a Latin in&s;cription, in an odd way of Writ|ing and full of Abbreviations; and, on the other &s;ide, in Engli&s;h, the following Account of this worthy Citizen, and of the Regard paid to him at that Time.</P>
<P>Mr. William Cannings, the riche&s;t Mer|chant of the Town of Bri&s;tow; after|wards cho&s;en five Times Mayor of the Town, for the Good of the Con mon Wealth of the fame: He was in Order of Prie&s;thood, and afterwards Dean of We&s;tburg; and dy'd the 7th of Nov. 1474: Which &s;aid William did Build within the &s;aid Town of We&s;tburgh, a College with his Canons; and the &s;aid William did maintain, by the $pace of 8 Years, 8 hundred handy Crafts Men, be&s;ides Carpenters and Ma&s;ons, every Day 100 Men&mdash;Be&s;ides K.

<P>Al&s;o here is the following In&s;cription on the Monument of Sir William Penn, Bart&punc; the Father of the great William Penn, one of the Heads of the Quakers, who was a Native of the City of Bri&s;tol: as follows.</P>
<P>To the ju&s;t Memory of Sir William Penn, Knt. and &s;ometime General; borne at Bri&s;tol, in 1621, Son of Capt. Giles Penn, &s;everal Years Con&s;ul for the Engli&s;h in the Mediterranean: De&s;cend|ed from the Penns of Penn Lodge in the County of Wilts, and the Penns of Penn near Wickham in the County of Bucks; and, by his Mother, from the Gilberts in the County of Somer&s;et, originally from York&s;hire; addicted from his Youth to Maritime Affairs. He was made Captain at the Years of 21, Rear-Admiral of Ireland at 23, Vice-Admiral of Ireland at 25, Admiral to the Streights at 29, Vice-Admiral at 31, and General of the fir&s;t Dutch Wars at 32: whence retiring, in Anno 1655, he was cho&s;en Parliament Man for the Town of Weymouth 1660, made Com|mi&s;&s;ioner of the Admiral and Navy, Go|vernour of the Towns and Forts of King&s;aile, Vice-Admiral of Mun&s;ter, and a Member of the Provincial Coun|cell; and, in Anno 1664, was cho&s;en Great Captain Commander under his Royal Highne&s;s, in that &s;ignal and mo&s;t prudently &s;ucce&s;sful Fight again&s;t the Dutch Fleet. Thus he took Leave of the Sea, his old Element, but continu|ed &s;till his other Employs 'till 1669, at what Time, thro' Bodily In$i$mities (contracted by the Care and Fatigue of the publick Affairs) he withdrew, pre|par'd, and made for his End, and with a gentle and even Gale, in much Peace, arrived and anchored in his la&s;t and be&s;t Port, at Wan&s;tead in the County of E&s;&s;ex, on the 16th of September, 167$, being than but 49 and 4 Months Old. To who&s;e Name and Merit his Surviv|ing Lady hath erected this Remem|brance.</P>
<P>In Travelling this latter Part of this &s;econd Tour, it has not been taken Notice of, though it very well de&s;erves Mention; what Soil of all the Midland Part of Eng|land, even from Sea to Sea, is of a de p &s;tiff Clay, or Marly Kind, and it carries a Breadth of near 50 Miles at lea&s;t, in &s;ome Places mcuh more; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to go from London to any Part of Britain, North, without cro&s;&s;ing this clayey dirty Part. For Example;</P>
<P N="1">1. Suppo&s;e we take the great Northern Po&s;t Road from London to York, and &s;o into Scotland; you have tolerable good Ways and hard Ground, 'till you reach Roy&s;ton about 32, and to Knee&s;worth, a Mile farther: But from thence you enter upon the Clays, which beginning at the famous Arrington-Lanes, and going on to Caxton, Huntington, Stilton, Stamf$rd,
<PB REF="331">
Grantham, Newark, Tuxford (call'd for $word$ Deepne&s;s Tuxford in the Clays) holds $word$ 'till we come almo&s;t to Bautrey, which $word$ the fir&s;t Town in York&s;hire, and there $he Country is hard and &s;ound, being part $f Sherwood Fore&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Suppo&s;e you take the other Northern $oad, namely, by St. Albans, Dun&s;table, Hockley, Newport Pagnel, Northampton, $eice&s;ter, and Nottingham, or Darby: On his Road, after you are pals'd Dun&s;table, which, as in the other Way, is about 30 Miles, you enter the deep Clays, which $word$ &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;oft, that it is perfect|$$ frightful to Travellers, and it has been he Wonder of Foreigners, how, con|dering the great Numbers of Carri$ges which are continually pa&s;&s;ing with heavy $oads, tho&s;e Ways have been made practi|$ble; indeed the great Number of Hor&s;es $ery Year killed by the Exce&s;s of La|$our in tho&s;e heavy Ways, has been &s;uch Charge to the Country, that new Build|$$g of Cau&s;eways, as the Romans did of $word$ &s;eems to me to be a much ea&s;ier $word$ From Hockley to Northampton, $ence to Harborough, and Leice&s;ter, and $ence to the very Bank of Trent the&s;e $rrible Clays continue; at Nottingham $word$ are pa&s;s'd them, and the Fore&s;t of $erwood yields a hard and plea&s;ant Road $word$ 30 Miles together.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take the &s;ame Road as it leads to $$ventry, and from thence to We&s;t Che&s;|$r, the deep Clays reach through all the $owns of Brickhill Fenny and Stony $$atford, Towce&s;ter, Daventry, Hill $otton, or Dunchurch, Coventry, Coles|$ll, and even to Birmingham, for very $ar 80 Miles.</P>
<P N="4">4. If we take the Road to Worce&s;ter, is the the &s;ame through the Vale of $lesbury to Buckingham, and We&s;tward Banbury, Keynton, and the Vale of $e&s;ham, where the Clays reach, with $$e Intermi&s;&s;ions, even to the Bank of $ern, as they do more Northernly quite We&s;t Che&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons of my taking Notice of this Badne&s;s of the Roads, through all the Midland Counties, is this; that as the&s;e are Counties which drive a very great Trade with the City of London, and with one another, perhaps the greate&s;t of any Counties in England; and that, by con|&s;equence, the Carriage is exceeding great, and al&s;o that all the Land Carriage of the Northern Counties nece&s;&s;arily goes through the&s;e Counties, &s;o the Roads had been plow'd &s;o deep, and Materials have been in &s;ome Places &s;o difficult to be had for Repair of the Roads, that all the Survey|ors Rates have been able to do nothing; nay, the very whole Country has not been able to repair them; that is to &s;ay, it was a Burthen too great for the poor Farmers; for in England it is the Tenant, not the Landlord, that pays the Surveyors of the Highways Charge.</P>
<P>This nece&s;&s;arily brought the Country to bring the&s;e Things before the Parlia|ment; and the Con&s;equence has been, that Turn pikes or Toll bars have been &s;et up on the &s;everal great Roads of Eng|land, beginning at London, and proceed|ing thro' almo&s;t all tho&s;e dirty deep Roads, in the Midland Counties e&s;pecially; at which Turn-pikes, all Carriages, Droves of Cattle, and Travellers on Hor&s;e-back, are oblig'd to pay an ea&s;y Toll; that is to &s;ay, a Hor&s;e a Penny, a Coach three Pence, a Cart four Pence, at &s;ome &s;ix Pence to eight Pence, a Waggon &s;ix Pence, in &s;ome a Shilling, and the like; Cattle pay by the Score, or by the Head, in &s;ome Places more, in &s;ome le&s;s; but in no Place is it thought a Burthen that ever I met with, the Benefit of a good Road abundantly making amends for that little Charge the Travellers are put to at the Turn-pikes.</P>
<P>Several of the&s;e Turn-pikes and Tolls have been &s;et up of late Years, and great Progre&s;s had been made in mending the mo&s;t difficult Ways, and that with &s;uch Succe&s;s as well de&s;erves a Placa in this Account: And this is one Rea&s;on for taking Notice of it in this Manner; for
<PB REF="332">
as the memory of the Romans, which is &s;o ju&s;tly famous, is pre&s;erv'd in nothing more vi&s;ible to common Ob&s;ervation, than in the Remains of tho&s;e noble Ca$&s;|ways and Highways, which they made through all parts of the Kingdom, and which were found &s;o needful, even then, when there was not the five hundredth part of the Commerce and Carriage that is now: How-much more valuable mu&s;t the&s;e new Works he, tho' nothing to compare with tho&s;e of the Romans, for the Firmne&s;s and Duration of their Work?</P>
<P>The Cau&s;ways and Roads, or Street|ways of the Romans, were perfect &s;olid Buildings, the Foundations were laid &s;o deep, and the Materials &s;o good, how|ever far they were oblig'd to fetch them, that if they had been vaulted and arch'd, they could not have been more &s;olid: I have &s;een the Bottom of them dug up in &s;everal Places, where I have ob&s;erv'd Flint-&s;tones, Chalk-&s;tones, hard Gravel, &s;olid hard Clay, and &s;everal other &s;orts of Earth, laid in Layers, like the Veins of Oar in a Mine; a laying of Clay of a &s;olid binding Quality, then Flint-&s;tones, then Chalk, then upon the Chalk rough Balla&s;t or Gravel, 'till the whole Work has been rai&s;ed &s;ix or eight Foot from the Bottom; then it has been covered with a Crown or ri&s;ing Ridge in the middle, gently &s;loping to the &s;ides, that the Rain might run off every way, and not &s;oak into the Work: This I have &s;een as fair and firm, after having &s;tood, as we may conclude&punc; at lea&s;t 12 or 1600 Years, as if it had been made but the Year before.</P>
<P>And that I may not be charged with going beyond the mo&s;t exact Truth, I re|fer the Curious to make their Ob&s;erva|tions upon that Cau&s;eway, call'd the Fo&s;&s;e, which is now remaining, and to be &s;een between Cirence&s;ter and Mar&s;hfield in Wilt&s;hire, on the Road to the Bath, or between the &s;ame Cirence&s;ter and Bird|lip Hill in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, on the Road to Glouce&s;ter: but more particularly, be|tween Ca&s;tleford Bridge, near Poutefrad in York&s;hire, upon the River A$$, $word$ the Town of Aberford in the Road to Tadca&s;ter and York.</P>
<P>In &s;everal Parts of this Ca$&s;eway, the Country being hard, and the way $word$ on either &s;ide, Travellers have not $word$ much U&s;e of the Cau&s;eway, it being $ay high, and perhaps expo&s;ing them $word$ much to the Wind and W$ather, $word$ have rather cho&s;en to go on either &s;ide, &s;o that the Cau&s;eway in &s;ome $laces, h$s as flat and &s;mooth on the Top, as $word$ it had never been made U&s;e of at $word$ and perhaps it has not, there being $word$ &s;o much as the mark of a Wheel upon it, or of a Hor&s;e Foot for a good w$$ together, for which I refer to the ca|ous Traveller that goes that way.</P>
<P>This very Cau&s;way have I $span$ into, &s;o as to di&s;cover the very Materials with which it was built; and in $$$e parts of the &s;ame Cau&s;way, farther North, where the great Road has taken $$at other way. I have &s;een the ol$ Cau$$$y dug down to carry the Materials away, and mend the Road which was th$n $word$ U&s;e.</P>
<P>It is true the Romans being Lord o$ the World, had the Command of the People, their Per&s;ons and their Work, their Cattle, and their Carriages; even their Armies were employ'd in the$e noble Undertakings; and if the materials they wanted, were to fetch 20, $ay $word$ to 40 Miles off, if they wanted them, they would have them, and the Works were great and magnificent like them|&s;elves: Witne&s;s the numberle&s;s Encam|ments, Lines, Ca&s;tles and Fortifications which we &s;ee the Remains of to this Day.</P>
<P>But now the Ca&s;e is alter'd, Labour is dear, Wages high, no Man works for Bread and Water now; our Labour$rs do not work in the Road, and drink $o the Brook; &s;o that as rich as we are it would exhau&s;t the whole Nation to build the Edifices, the Cau&s;ways, the Aqueducts, Lines, Ca&s;tles, Fortifications,
<PB REF="333">
and other publick Works, which the Ro|mans built with very little Expence.</P>
<P>But to return to this new Method of repairing the Highways at the Expence of the Turn-pikes; that is to &s;ay, by the Product of Funds rais'd at tho&s;e Turn-pikes; it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd they are very great Things, and very great Things are done by them; and 'tis well worth recording, for the Honour of the pre|&s;ent Age&punc; that this Work has been be|gun, and is in an extraordinary Manner $arry'd on, and perhaps may, in a great mea&s;ure be compleated within our memo|$y. I &s;hall give &s;ome Examples here of $ho&s;e which have been brought to Per|$ection already, and of others which are $ow carrying on.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that great County of E&s;&s;ex, of which our fir&s;t Tour gives an ample Account. The great Road from London, $hro' this whole County towards Ip&s;|$ich and Harwich, is the mo&s;t worn with Waggons, Carts, and Carriages; and with $$&s;i$i$e Droves of Black Cattle, Hogs, $nd Sheep, of any Road (that leads thro' $o larger an Extent of Country) in Eng|land: The length of it from Stratford|bridge by Bow, to Strectford&punc;bridge over $$e Stour, on the &s;ide of Su$$olk, is 50 Miles, and to Harwich above 65 Miles.</P>
<P>The&s;e Roads were formerly deep&punc; in $$me of Floods dangerous, and at other $$mes, in Winter, &s;carce pa&s;&s;able; they $$e now &s;o firm, &s;o &s;afe, &s;o ea&s;y to Tra|$ellers, and Carriages as well as Cattle, $hat no Road in England can yet be &s;aid $o equal them; this was fir&s;t done by $$e help of a Turnpike, &s;et up by Act $f Parliament, about the Year 1697, at Village near Inger&s;tone. Since that, $$other Turnpike, &s;et up at the Corner $f the Dog-Row, near Mile-End; with $word$ additional one at Rumford, which is $$lled a Branch, and paying at one, pa&s;|$$s the Per&s;on thro' both: This I &s;ay, $$ing &s;et up &s;ince the other, compleats $e whole, and we are told, that as the fir&s;t $$pires in a Year or two, this la&s;t will $word$ &s;ufficient for the whole, which will be a great Ea&s;e to the Country: The fir&s;t Toll&punc;near Inger&s;tone, being the highe&s;t rated publick Toll in England, for they take 8 d. for every Cart, 6 d. for every Coach, and 12 d. for every Waggon; and in proportion for Droves of Cattle: For &s;ingle Hor&s;e-men indeed, it is the &s;ame as others pay, viz. 1 d, per Hor&s;e, and we are told, while this is doing, that the Gentlemen of the County, de&s;ign to Petition the Parliament, to have the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the la&s;t Act, who&s;e Turn|pike, as above&punc; is at Mile-End and Rum|ford, empowered to place other Turn|pikes on the other mo&s;t con&s;iderable Roads, and &s;o to Undertake, and Repair all the Roads in the whole County, I mean all the con&s;iderable Roads.</P>
<P>But to come back to the Counties which I am now &s;peaking of, &s;ome very good attempts have been made of this kind on the Northern Roads, thro' tho&s;e deep ways I mentioned, in the High Po&s;t Road; for example,</P>
<P>That an Act of Parliament was ob|tained about 30 Years &s;ince, for repair|ing the Road between Ware and Roy|&s;ton, and a Turnpike was erected for it at Wade's mill, a Village &s;o called, about a mile and half beyond Ware: This proved &s;o effectual, that the Road there, which was before &s;carce pa&s;&s;able, is now built up in a high, firm Cau&s;eway; the mo&s;t like tho&s;e mentioned above, of the Ro|mans, of any of the&s;e new Undertakings. And, though this Road is continually worked upon, by the va&s;t numbers of Carriages, bringing Malt and Barly to Ware, for who&s;e &s;ake indeed, it was obtained, yet, with &s;mall Repairs it is maintained, and the Toll is reduced from a Penny to a Halfpenny, for the Ea&s;e of the country, and &s;o in proportion.</P>
<P>Beyond this, two Grants have been obtained; one for repair of tho&s;e wretched Places, called Arrington Lanes, and all the Road beyond Roy&s;ton, to Caxton and Huntington; and another, for repair|ing the road from Stukely to Stilton, in|cluding
<PB REF="334">
the place called Stangate Hole, and &s;o on, towards Wansford and Santry Lane and Peterborough; by which the&s;e Roads, which were before intollerable, are now much mended, but I cannot &s;ay, they are yet come up to the Perfection of that Road from London to Colche&s;t$r.</P>
<P>One great Difficulty indeed here, is, that the Country is &s;o Univer&s;ally made up of a deep&punc; &s;tiff Clay, that 'tis hard to find any Materials to repair the Ways with, that may be depended upon In &s;ome Places they have a red &s;andy kind of a Slate or Stone, which they lay with Timber and green Faggots, and puts them to a very great Expence; but this Stone does not bi$d like Chalk and Gravel, or endure like Flint and Pebbles, but wears into Clay from whence it proceeds; and this is the rea&s;on why they cannot expect tho&s;e Roads can reach up, however chargeable the repairs are to the goodne&s;s of the Roads in E$$ex.</P>
<P>We &s;ee al&s;o a Turnpike &s;et up at a Vil|lage very ju&s;tly called Foul Mire near Cambridge, for the repair of the particular Roads to the Univer&s;ity, but tho&s;e Works are not yet brought to any Perfection.</P>
<P>There is another Road, which is a Branch of the Northern Road, and is pro|perly called the Coach Road, which, and comes into the other near S$a$gate Hole; and this indeed is a mo&s;t frightful Way, if we take it from Hatfield, or rather the Park Corners of Hatfield Hou&s;e, and from thence to Stevenage, to Baldock, to Bid|gle&s;wade, and Bugden. Here is that fa|mous Lane called Baldock Lane, famous for being &s;o unpa&s;&s;able, that the Coaches and Travellers were obliged to break out of the Way even by Force, which the People of the Country not able to pre|vent, at length placed Gates, and laid their Lands open, &s;etting Men at the Gates to take a voluntary Toll, which Travellers always cho&s;e to pay, rather than plunge into Sloughs and Holes, which no Hor&s;es could wade through.</P>
<P>This terrible Road is now under Cure by the &s;ame Methods, and probably may in Time be brought to be firm and &s;olid, the Chalk and Stones being not &s;o $word$ fetch here, as in &s;ome of tho&s;e other Places I have ju&s;t now mention'd.</P>
<P>But the Repair of the Roads in the County, namely Bedford&s;hire, is not $word$ ea&s;y a Work, as in &s;ome other Parts $word$ England The Drifts of Cattle, $word$ come this Way out of Lincoln&s;h$$e and the Fens of the I&s;le of Ely, of which I have &s;poken already, are &s;o great $word$ $word$ con&s;tantly coming up to $word$ that it is much more difficult to make the Ways good, where they are $word$ treading by the F$et of the larg$ $word$ Bullocks, of which the N$$b$$s $word$ come this way are &s;carce to be $word$ up, and which make deep $word$ where the Ground is not very $word$ and often work through in the Winter what the Commi&s;&s;ioners have mended in $word$ Summer.</P>
<P>But leaving the&s;e Uundertakings to &s;peak for them&s;elves when $word$ for they can neither be ju&s;tly prais'd $word$ &s;ur'd before; it ought to be observ'd there is another Road branching $word$ this deep Way at Stevenage, and $word$ thence to Hitchin, to Sh$fford, and $word$ ford. Hitchin is a large Market $ows&punc; and particularly eminent for its burg a great Corn Market for Whe$t and $word$ but e&s;pecially the fir&s;t, which is $word$ here for London Market. The Road to Hitchin, and thence to Bedford, tho' not a great Thorough&punc;fare for $word$ is a very u&s;eful Highway for the $word$ of Carriages, which bring Wheat from Bedford to that Market, and from the Country round it, even as $ar as North|ampton&s;hire, and the Edge of $word$ and many Times the Country People are not able to bring their Coin for the meer Badne&s;s of the Ways.</P>
<P>This Road, I hear, will be l k$wi&s;e re|pair'd, by Virtue of a Turn pike to be plac'd near Hitchin on this S de&punc; and $t the two Bridges over the Ou$e, namely Barford Bridge and Bedford Bridge, on the other Side; as al&s;o at Temsford, where they drive through the River without the help of a Bridge.</P>
<P><PB REF="335">
But to leave what may be. I return to what is. The next Turn pikes are on the great North We&s;t Road, or as I have di&s;|tingui&s;h'd it already, the Watling-&s;treet Way; which, to de&s;cribe it once for all, begins at I&s;$ington near London, and leads to Shrewsbury, We&s;t Che&s;ter, and Holly|head in Wales; with other Branches breaking out from it to the North, lead|ing to Nottingham, Darby, Burton on the $reat, and Warrington&punc; and from them all, f$$her North, into the North We&s;t $word$ of Great Britain; for they are the $word$ Pa&s;&s;es into York&s;hire, Darby&s;hire, $word$ $word$ and thro' them to $word$ and, Cumberland, Durham, and $word$ of all which I &s;hall give $word$ Account in my next Let$ers.</P>
<P>Upon the g eat Road there are wonder|$l Improvements made and making, which $word$ T aveller can mils the Ob&s;ervation of, $pecially if he knew the Condition the&s;e $ays were formerly in; nor can my $word$ of the&s;e Counties be perfect, $word$ Notice of it; for certainly no $word$ Edifice, Alms hou&s;e&punc; Ho&s;pital, or $obleman's Palace, can be of equal Value $word$ Country with this, no nor more an $word$ our a$d Ornament to it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Attempt upon this Road was $word$ in Buckingham&s;hire, and the $word$ was &s;et up on the Hill, near $word$ Town call'd Little Brick-hill, by ver|$ of which, they repaired the Road from $word$ to Stony Stratford, for about ten $word$ and with very good Succe&s;s; for $word$ Road wa broad, and capable of $word$ for &s;uch a Work; and tho' $word$ were hard to come a$, and far to $word$ yet we &s;oon &s;ound a large fi$m $word$ or Highway, and of a f$ll $word$ reaching from Fenny Stratford, $ony Stratford which is &s;ix Miles, and $re the Way was exceeding bad before. $his encouraged the Country to &s;et at the Work in good earne&s;t; and we &s;ee the mo&s;t $word$ Piece of Ground Travelling, that ever was in England, $fomly repair'd; namely, from the of the chalky Hill beyond Dun&s;table $word$ into Hockley Lane, and thro' Hock|ley, ju&s;tly called Hockley in the Hole, to Newport $$gnaci, being a bye Branch of the great Road, and leading to North|ampton, and was called the Coach Road; but &s;uch a Road for Coaches, as wor&s;e was hardly ever &s;een.</P>
<P>Thee next (to come Southward) was the Road from St. Albans to South Mims, a Village beyond Barnet: Soon after this Road parts from the great Coach Road to the North, which I mentioned before, be|ginning at Ha$field.</P>
<P>This Road, from M$ms to St&punc; Albans&punc; is &s;o well mended, the Work &s;o well done, and the Materials &s;o good&punc; &s;o plentifully furni&s;hed, and &s;o faithfully apply'd, that, in &s;hort, if po&s;&s;ible, it out does the E&s;&s;ex Ro$d mentioned before; for here the Bottom is not only repair'd, but the nar|row Places are widen'd. Hills levell'd, Bottoms rai&s;ed, and the A&s;cents and De|&s;cents made ea&s;y, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Ea&s;e and Advantage of Travellers, and e&s;pecial|ly of the Carriers, who draw heavy Goods and hard Loads, who find the Benefit in the Health and Strength of their Cattle.</P>
<P>From hence, to come &s;till more towards London, another Undertaking reaches from the Foot of Barnet Hill, call'd for|merly the Blockhou&s;e, to Wh$$&s;tone, and &s;o over the great Hea$h, calld Finchley Common, to $$ighgate Hill, and up the Hill to the Garehou&s;e at Highgate, where they had their Tur$p$k$; as al&s;o at the Blockhou&s;e; and this Work is al&s;o admir|ably well perform'd, and thro' a Piece of Ground, which was very full of Sloag$$$ and deep Places before.</P>
<P>But from Highgate to London &s;till re|quired help; the Road branch'd into two, at the Top of Highgate Hill, or ju&s;t at the Gatehou&s;e there; one came to London by I&s;lington, and there branch'd again in|to two, one coming by the North End of I&s;lington, and another on the Back of the Town, and entring the Town at the South We&s;t End near the Angel Inn, there di|viding again, one Branch entred London at Go&s;well &s;treet and Alder&s;gate &s;treet; and this was the principal Road for Wag|gons and Pack hor&s;es: The other going
<PB REF="336">
directly to St. John-&s;treet and into Smith|field; and this way was the chief road for cattle to Smithfield Market.</P>
<P>The other Road parting off at High|gate, came down the Hill by the late Sir William A&s;hur&s;t's Hou&s;e, of which I made mention in its Plece, and thence pa&s;&s;ing through Kenti&s;h Town, entered London by two ways; one by Gray's Inn Lane, and the other by Clerkenwell.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Roads were to the la&s;t Ex|tremity run to ruin, and grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e &s;o evidently, that it was next to impo&s;&s;ible, the country &s;hould be able to repait them: Upon which an Act of Parliament was obtained for a Turnpike, which is now erected at I&s;lington afore|&s;aid, as al&s;o all the other Branches by the Kenti&s;h Town way, and others; &s;o that by this new Toll, all the&s;e Roads are now likely to be made good, which were before almo&s;t a &s;candal to the City of London.</P>
<P>Another Turnpike, and which was erected before this, was on the great North Road, beginning at Shoreditch, and extending to Enfield-&s;treet, in the way to Ware; though this road is ex|ceedingly throng'd, and rai&s;es great Sums, yet I cannot &s;ay, that the road it&s;elf &s;eems to be &s;o evidentiy improved, and &s;o effectually repaired, as the others la&s;t mentioned, notwith&s;tanding no materials are wanting; even on the very Verge of the road it&s;elf, whether it be, that the number of Carriages, which come this way, and which are indeed greater than in any other road about London, is the Occa&s;ion, or whether the Per&s;ons con|cerned do not &s;o faithfuily, or &s;o skil|fully perform, I will not undertake to de|termine.</P>
<P>After &s;o many encouraging Examples on this great Watling-&s;treet Road, as I have mentioned above, they have now begun the like on the &s;ame way farther down, and particularly from Stony Strat|ford to Daventry and Dunchurch, and &s;o on to Coventry and Coles Hill; all tho&s;e Parts of it are at this Time repair|ing, and they promi&s;e them&s;elves that $word$ a few Years tho&s;e Roads will be com|pleatly &s;ound and firm, as Watling-&s;treet was in its mo&s;t ancient and flouri&s;hing State; bu$ this mu&s;t be mentioned, like any public Edifice, which is now Build|ing, and perhaps may require &s;ome Time to fini&s;h.</P>
<P>I come next to mention other works of the &s;ame Kind in remoter Places, al|&s;o more We&s;terly, but within the com|pa&s;s of this Midland Circuit; as parti|cularly the Road from Birdlip $word$ to Glouce&s;ter, formerly a terrible place $word$ poor Carriers and Travellers out of Wales, &amp;c. But now repaired very well</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the Road from Sandy La$e Hill in Wilt&s;hire to the Bath, which began to be repaired by the Direction of her late Maje&s;ty Q. Anne.</P>
<P>Al&s;o another piece of had Road $word$ Beaconsfield in Oxford&s;hire.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame happy Example, T$m|pikes are erected at the We&s;t $word$ of the Town, for repairing that ho r'd Road, formerly al&s;o a part of the $word$ &s;treet way, from St. Giles's Church to $word$ and thence to Edgworth, obtain$ fir&s;t by the intere&s;t and motion of his Grace the Duke of Chandos.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the River is another Turnpike erected, or rather two Turnpikes, one at the North End of the Town of Newington, called Newington Buts, which has two or three colateral Branches, viz. one at Vaux-Hall, at the Bridge near the Spring Garden corner, and another at Croyden, be&s;ides &s;maller Toll-Bars on the Bye-Lanes. This Un|dertaking has been very well pro&s;ecuted, and the great Suffex Road, which was formerly un&s;ufferably bad, is now be|come admirably good; and this is $word$ at &s;o great an Expence, that they told me at Strettham, that one mile between the two next Bridges South of that Town, co&s;t a thou&s;and Pounds repairing, includ|ing one of the Bridges, and yet it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that the Materials are
<PB REF="337">
very near Hand, and every good all the Way to Croyden.</P>
<P>The other Turnpike on that Side is placed near New Cro&s;s on the Road into $ent, a little before the Road to Lu&s;um $$ts from the Road to Deptford Bridge; $word$ that all the Road to Lee and Eltham, $word$ Road to Bromley and Tunbridge, as $$ll as the great Road to Roche&s;ter and $word$ are taken in there; and this $word$ taking, they tell us, is likewi&s;e very $word$ perform'd.</P>
<P>$word$ that upon the whole, this Cu&s;tom $word$ 'tis more than probable, that $span$ may &s;ee the Roads all over $span$ in their Time to &s;uch a $word$ that Travelling and Carriage Goods will be much more ea&s;y both to $word$ and Hor&s;e, than ever it was &s;ince $word$ Romans lo&s;t this I&s;land.</P>
<P>$word$ will the Charge be burthen&s;ome to $word$ Body&punc; as for Trade, it will be $word$ by it every Way; for Carriage of $word$ of heavy Goods will be much $word$ the Waggoners will either perform $word$ Time, or draw heavier Loads, or the $word$ Load with $ewer Hor&s;es; the $word$ will carry heavier Burthens, to $word$ farther in a Day, and &s;o perform $word$ Journey in le&s;s Time; all which will $word$ to le&s;&s;en the Rate of Carriage, and $word$ Goods cheaper to Market.</P>
<P>$he $at Cattle will drive lighter, and $word$ to Market with le&s;s Toil, and $word$ both go farther in one Day, and $word$ their Fl$&s;h, and heat and &s;poil $word$ in wallowing thro' the Mud $word$ as is now the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>$word$ Sheep will be able to travel in the $word$ and the City not be oblig'd to give $word$ to the Butchers for Mutton, $word$ $t cannot be brought up out of $word$ and Lincoln&s;hire, the Sheep $word$ able to travel: The Graziers $word$ will not be oblig'd to &s;ell $word$ of Weathers cheap in $word$ the Farmers within 20 Miles of $word$ becau&s;e after that they cannot them up; but the Ways being $l|was light and found, the Cra&s;iers will keep their Stocks them&s;elves, and bring them up to Market as they &s;ee Cau&s;e, as well in Winter as in Summer.</P>
<P>Another Benefit of the&s;e new Mea&s;ures for repairing the Roads by Turnpikes, is the opening of Drains and Water cour&s;es&punc; and Building Bridges, e&s;pecially over the &s;maller Waters, which are oftentimes the mo&s;t dangerous to Travellers on ha&s;ty Rains, and always mo&s;t injurious to the Roads, by lying in Ho$e$ and Puddles, to the great $po$ling the Bottom, and making con&s;tant Sloughs, &s;ometimes able to bury both Man and Hor&s;e; 'tis very remarkable that the Over&s;eers of the&s;e Works take effectual Care to have Bridges built in &s;uch Places, and Currents made or opened for the Waters to pals, by which abundance of Labour is &s;av'd in con&s;tantly rending the Waters on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; but o$ this al&s;o we &s;hall &s;ay more pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>To give an eminent In&s;tance of $word$ we refer the Curious to take the Road from Blackman-&s;treet in Southwa$k, to C$oyd$n, for an Example, where, if we are not mi&s;taken, he will find eleven Bridges whol|ly new built in ten Miles length, by which was before a mo&s;t uncomfortable Road to travel.</P>
<P>This improving of the Roads is an in|finite Improvement to the Towns near London, in the Convenience of coming to them, which makes the Citizens flock out in greater Numbers than ever to take Lodgings and Country - Hou&s;es, which many, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s call'd them often to London, could not do, becau&s;e of the Labour of riding forward and backward, when the Roads were but a little duty, and this is &s;een in the Difference in the Rents of Hou&s;es in tho&s;e Villages upon &s;uch repair'd Roads, from the Rents of the like Dwellings and Lodgings in other Towns of equal Di&s;tance, where they want tho&s;e Helps, and particularly the En|crea&s;e of the Number of Buildings in tho&s;e Towns, as above.</P>
<P><PB REF="338">
This probably has not been the lea&s;t Rea&s;on why &s;uch Tolls are erected now on every Side of London, or &s;oon will be, and I doubt not but in Time it will be the like all over England.</P>
<P>There are indeed &s;ome very deep Roads in many Places of England, and that South by Trent too, where no &s;uch Pro|vi&s;ion is yet made for Repair of the Roads, as partic$larly in and through the Vale of Aylesbury, and to Buckingham, and beyond it into Oxford&s;hire; al&s;o be|yond Northampton to Harborough and Leice&s;ter; al&s;o in Lincoln&s;hire, beyond what we nam'd to be from Huntington to Stilton, the Road from Stamford to Grantham&punc; $ewark, and Tuxford, in the Clays, all which remain very deep, and in &s;ome Sea&s;ons dangerous.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the Roads in Su&s;&s;ex, and that in particular which was formerly a Roman Work, called Stony-&s;treet or Stone &s;treet: Mr. Cambden mentions it as going from Leatherhead to Darking, and thro' Dark|ing Church-yard, then cro&s;s a terrible deep Country, call'd the Homeward, and &s;o to Petworth and Arundel: But we &s;ee no|thing of it now; and the Country indeed remains in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s for want of good Roads: So al&s;o all over the Wild of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex it is the &s;ame, where the Corn is cheap at the Barn, becau&s;e it can|not be carry'd out; and dear at the Mar|ke$, becau&s;e it cannot be brought in.</P>
<P>But the Specimens above, will, we doubt not, prompt the Country Gentlemen in Time to go through with it all over Eng|land; and 'tis to give a clear View of this important Ca&s;e, that we have given this Account of them.</P>
<P>The Benefit of the&s;e Turnpikes appears now to be &s;o great, and the People in all Places begin to be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of it, that it is incredible what Effect it has already had upon Trade in the Countries where it is more compleatly fini&s;h'd; even the Carriage of Goods is abated in &s;ome Pla|ces, 6 d. per hundred Weight, in &s;ome Places 12 d per hundred, which is abun|dantly more advantage to Commerce, than the Charge paid amounts to, and yet at the &s;ame Time the $span$ Carriers too, who make the $span$ &s;o that the Benefit in abating th$ $span$ Carriage is wholly and &s;imply the $word$ not the Carriers.</P>
<P>Yet the Advantage is evident $span$ Carriers al&s;o another Way; $span$ ob&s;erv'd before, they can $span$ Weight with the &s;ame $span$ nor are their Hor&s;es &s;o hard $span$ fatigued with their $span$ before; in which one $span$ knowledg'd by the $span$ their Work with more $span$ are at le&s;s Expence.</P>
<P>The Advantage to all other $span$ Travelling I omit here; $u$h as $span$ and Ea&s;e to Gentlemen $span$ London on all Occa&s;ions, $span$ Term, or to Parliament, $span$ any other nece&s;&s;ary $span$ not a &s;mall Part of the Benefit $span$ new Methods.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Riding Po&s;t, as $span$ ordinary carrying of the $span$ the Gentlemen riding Po&s;t, $span$ Occa&s;ions require Speed; $span$ Po&s;t is made extreamly $span$ plea&s;ant, by this Alteration of the $word$</P>
<P>I mention &s;o often the Safety of $span$ on this Occa&s;ion, becau&s;e, $span$ &s;erv'd before, the Commi&s;&s;ioners for $word$ Repairs of the Highways have $word$ and do daily order, abundance $span$ to be repair'd and enlarg'd, and $word$ built, where they find Occa&s;ion, $word$ not only &s;erve to carry the Water $word$ where it otherwi&s;e often &s;pread$, a $word$ as it were, damm'd up upon the $word$ and &s;poils the Way, but where $word$ &s;ometimes by &s;udden Rains to a $word$ Height; for it is to be ob&s;erved&punc; $word$ there is more Hazard, and more $span$ in pa&s;&s;ing, or attempting to pa&s;s $word$ Brooks and Streams, which $span$ &s;udden Showers of Rain, $span$ expect no Stoppage, $span$ great Rivers, where the $word$ known, and therefore more $word$ avoided.</P>
<P><PB REF="339">
In many of the&s;e Places the Commi&s;|&s;$$ners have built large and &s;ub&s;tantial $word$ for the Benefit of Travelling, as $span$ already, and in other Places have $span$ Sluices to &s;top, and opened $span$ carry off the Water, where they $span$ to &s;well into the Highway: We have $span$ of the&s;e Sluices near London, in the $span$ th$o' Tottenham High Cro&s;s and $span$ by which the Waters in tho&s;e $span$ which have &s;ometimes been $span$ are now carry'd off, and the Road $span$ and as for B$$dges, I have been $span$ $hat the &s;everal Commi&s;&s;ioners, in $span$ Di&s;tricts where they are $span$ have already built above three $span$ new Ones, where there were $word$ $word$ or where the former were $word$ $span$ and in&s;ufficient to carry the Travel|$$$ $word$ over $he Waters; many of the&s;e $word$ within a few Miles of London; e&s;pe|$$$ly, for Example, on the great Road $word$ London to Edgeworth, from Lon|$$$ to E$$$eld, from London to St. $word$ and, as before, from London to $word$ where they are very plain to be $word$ and to which I refer.</P>
<P>And for fa$ther Confirmation of what I have advanced above, namely, that we m$y expect, according to this good Be|ginning, that the Roads in mo&s;t Parts of Engla$d will in a few Years be fully re|pa$$&punc;d, and re&s;tored to the $$m$ good $word$ (or perhaps a better, then) they $span$ during the Roman Governm$ut, $span$ take N$t$$$, that there are no $word$ t$an tw$lve $ills, or Petitions for $span$ the Parliament, at $word$ la$e $word$ for the Repair of the $word$ in &s;everal $emote Parts of Eng|$$nd $r for the lengthening the Time al|lowed in former A$$s; &s;ome of which, $word$ tho&s;e hereafter mentioned, give us $word$ that the Grants, when obtained, will $e very we$l managed, and the Coun|try Peo$le gr$$$ly en$ouraged by them in the$r $word$ for there is no Doubt to b$ ma$$, but that the Inland Trade of England has been greatly ob&s;tructed by the exc$$d$ng $word$ of the Roads.</P>
<P>A particular Example of this, I have mentioned already, viz. the bringing of Fat Cattle, e&s;pecially Sheep to London in the Winter, from the remoter Counties of Leice&s;ter and Lincoln, where they are bred; by which the Country Gra&s;$ers are obliged to &s;ell their Stock-o$f, at the lat|ter End of the Summer, namely Septem|ber and October, when they &s;ell cheap, and the $$$chers and Farmers near London engro&s;s them, and keeping them 'till De|cember and Janua$y, $ell them, tho' not an O$nce $a$$$r than befor$, for an ad|vanced Price, to the Citizens of London, whereas, were the Roads made good and pa&s;&s;able, the City would be &s;erved with Mutton almo&s;t as cheap in the Winter as in the Summer, for the Profit of the Ad|vance would be to the Graziers of Leice&s;ter and Lincoln&s;hires, who were the original Breeders.</P>
<P>This is evidence to a Demon&s;tration in the Counties of E&s;&s;ex and Suffolk, from whence they already bring their $at Cat|tle, and particularly their Mutton in Droves, from Sixty, Seventy, or Eighty Miles, without fatiguing, $arra&s;&s;$$g, or &s;inking the Fle&s;h of the Creature$, even in the Depth of Winter.</P>
<P>I might give Examples of other Bran|ches of Inland Commerce, which would be quite altered for the better, by this $$|&s;toring the Goodne&s;s of the Roads, and particularly that of carrying Chee&s;e, a Species of Provi&s;ion &s;o con&s;iderable, that nothing, except that of live Cattle, can exceed it.</P>
<P>This is chiefly made in the three North We&s;t Counties of England, viz. Che&s;hire, Glouce&s;ter, and Warwick&s;hires, and the Pars adjacent, from whence the Nation is very meanly &s;upply'd, by rea&s;on of the exceeding Di&s;tance of the Country where the Chee&s;e is made, from tho&s;e Counties where it is chiefly expended.</P>
<P>The Che&s;hire Men indeed carry great Quantities about by long Sea, as they call it, to London; a terrible long, and $$me|times dangerous, Voyage, being thro' the $$&s;h Channel, round all Wales, cro&s;s the
<PB REF="340" MS="Y">
Bri&s;tol Channel, round the Land's End of Cornwall, and up the Engli&s;h Channel to the Mouth of the Thames, and &s;o up to London; or el&s;e by Land to Burton upon Trent, and &s;o down that river to Gaines|borough and Hull, and &s;o by Sea to Lon|don.</P>
<P>Again, the Glouce&s;ter&s;hire Men carry all by Land-Carriage to Lechlade and Cricklade on the Thames, and &s;o carry it down the River to London.</P>
<P>But the Warwic#&s;hire Men have no Water Carriage at all, or at lea&s;t not 'till they have carry'd it a long Way by Land to Oxford; but as their Quantity is ex|ceed$ng great, and they &s;upply not only the City of London, but al&s;o the Coun|ties of E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Hertford, Bedford, and Nor|thampton, the Gro&s;s of their Carriage is by meer dead Draught, and they carry it either to London by Land, which is full an hundred Miles, and &s;o the London Chee&s;mongers &s;upply the &s;aid Counties of E&s;&s;ex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, be&s;ides Kent, and Su&s;&s;ex, and Surrey by Sea and River Navigation: or the Warwick&s;hire Men carry it by Land once a Year to Stur|bridge Fair, whence the Shop-keepers of all the Inland Country above-named, come to buy it; in all which Ca&s;es Land&punc;Car|riage being long, and the Ways bad, makes it very dear to the Poor, who are the Con|&s;umers.</P>
<P>But were the Ways from Warwick&s;hire made good, as I have &s;hewn they ate al|ready in E&s;&s;ex, and &s;ome other Places; this Carriage would be perform'd for little more than half the Price that it now is, and the Poor would have their Provi&s;ions much cheaper.</P>
<P>I could enlarge here upon the Con|venience that would follow &s;uch a re&s;tor|ing the Ways, for the carrying of Fi&s;h from the Sea Coa&s;ts to the Inner Parts of the Kingdom, where, by re$&s;on of t$$ Badne&s;s of the Ways, they cannot $word$ carry them &s;weet; This would $word$ encrea&s;e the Con&s;umption of $span$ Sea&s;on, which now for that very $word$ is but &s;mall, and would employ $word$ numerable Number of Hor&s;es and $word$ as well as encrea&s;e the Shippi$g by that Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>By this Carriage of Fi&s;h. I do n$t $word$ mean the carrying Herrin$s and $span$ to London, as is practis'd on the $span$ Su&s;&s;ex and Kent in particular, a$$ $word$ Salmon from the remote river$ $span$ and Treat; but the c$arying of $word$ Mackerell, and Sprats in their $word$ and Whitings and flat Fi&s;h at other Times, from the Coa&s;ts of Yarmouth, Swole, Ip&s;wich, Colche&s;ter, Malden, &amp;c. and $up|plying all the Inland Counties with them &s;weet and good, which 'tis plain they might do, were the Roads made $word$ even as far as Northampton, and $word$ and farther too.</P>
<P>I might give Examples where the H$$|rings, which are not the be&s;t Fi&s;h to keep neither, are, even as it is, carry'd to tho&s;e Towns, and up to Warwick, Birmingham, Tamworth and Stafford, and tho' they frequently &s;tink before they come thither, yet the People are &s;o eager of them, that they buy them, and give dear for them too; whereas were the Roads good, they would come in le&s;s Time, by at lea&s;t two Days in Six, and teu-fold the Quantity nay, &s;ome &s;ay, an hundred Times th$&punc; Quantity, be con&s;um'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and many others, are the Ad|vantages to our Inland Commerce, which we may have Room to hope for upon the general Repair of the Roads, and which I &s;hall have great Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of again in my Northern Circuit that is yet to come.</P>

<P>AS I am to begin this Circuit from the River Trent, and to confine my Ob&s;ervations to that Part of Britain which the Scots Northumberlanders, and others on $word$ &s;ide, call North by Trent, it &s;eems $span$ (at lea&s;t it cannot be $word$ to give &s;ome De&s;ription of the $word$ and e&s;pecially the cour&s;e which $word$ by which, adding a little River $word$ the Weaver, and a Branch of it $word$ the Dane in Stafford&s;hire and $word$ the whole I&s;land of Britain is, as $word$ divided into two Parts.</P>

<P>The Original of its Name is very un|certain, as is the Ca&s;e in mo&s;t other Ri|vers of England; then it takes the Name of Trent, as above, becau&s;e there are thirty &s;everal Sorts of Fi&s;h in it, or that, like the Tibi&s;cus in Hungary, it is three Parts Water, and two Parts Fi&s;h; all the&s;e the learned and judicious Mr. Cambden rejects, as I do for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, namely, becau&s;e they have no Authority for the Sugge&s;tion.</P>
<P>One Branch of the Trent ri&s;es within a Quarter of a Mile of the Dane, viz. from a Moor adjoining to, or Part of a little Ridge of Hills called Molecop Hill, near Congleton, and is within twenty two Miles of the Iri&s;h Sea, or that Arm or Inlet of the Sea which the Mer$$e makes from Frod&s;ham to Liverpool and Hyle-lake; and as the Dane runs into the Weaver, and both into that Arm of the Sea, and the Trent into the Humber,

which opens into the great German O|cean, tho&s;e Rivers may be &s;aid to cut the I&s;land cro&s;s in the middle.</P>
<P>It is true the Northern Part is much larger than the Southern, now Scotland is united; otherwi&s;e the Country South by Trent, including Wales, is by far the large&s;t: But it mu&s;t be allowed &s;till&punc; that the Country South by Trent is the riche&s;t by far, and mo&s;t populous; occa&s;ioned chiefly by the City of London, and the Commerce of the Thames; as for the Cities of Bri&s;tol, Exc$$er, and Norwich, which are large and very populous, and in &s;ome things drive a prodigious Trade, as well in Merchandi&s;e as Manufacture, we &s;hall find them matched, if not out|done, by the growing Towns of Liver|pool, Hull, Leeds, Newca&s;tle, and Man|che&s;ter, and the Cities of Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow&punc; as &s;hall be &s;hown in its Place.</P>
<P>The Trent runs a Cour&s;e of near two hundred Miles, through the four Coun|ties of Stafford, Derby, Nottingham, and Lincoln; it receives, be&s;ides le&s;&s;er&punc; Wa|ters&punc; the larger Rivers of the Sowe from the We&s;t Side&punc; of the County&punc; and from the Town of Stafford; the Tame from Birmingham and Tamworth; the Soar from Leice&s;ter; and the Dove and Der|went, two furiou&s;ly rapid Streams, from the Peak of Derby; the Idle, a gentle navigable Stream from Rhetford and Not|tingham&s;hire; with Part of the Whittham, called the Fo&s;&s;d$ke from Lincoln, al&s;o navigable; and the greate&s;t of them all, the Don, from Donca&s;ter, Rothram&punc; and Sheffield, after a long and rapid Cour&s;e through the Moors called S$onecro&s;s on the Edge of Derby, and the We&s;t&punc;riding of York&s;hire.</P>
<P>The Trent is navigable by Ships of good Burthen as high as Gainsbrough, which is near 40 Miles from the Hum|ber by the River. The Barges without the help of Locks or Stops go as high as Nottingham, and farther by the Help of Art, to Burton upon Trent in Stafford|&s;hire. The Stream is full, the Channel deep and &s;afe, and the Tide flows up a gr$$$ Way between Gai$sborough and Newark. This, and the Navigation lar$$ly reaching up to Burton and up $word$ Derwent to Derby, is a great Suppo$$$$ and Encrea&s;e of the Trade of tho&s;$ C$$$ties which border upon it; $span$ the Chee&s;e Trade from Che&s;hire and $word$ wick&s;hire, which have otherwi&s;e $span$ vigation but about from We&s;t $word$ London; whereas by th s $span$ brought by Water to Hu$l, and $word$ thence to all the South and North $word$ on the Ea&s;t Side of Britain; 't$s $span$ that there is about four thousand $word$ of Che&s;hire Chee&s;e only, brought $word$ the Trent every Year from tho&s;e $word$ of England to Gainsborough and $word$ and e&s;pecially in Time of the late $word$ when the Seas on the other Side of $word$ were too dangerous to bring $span$ long-Sea.</P>
<P>Thus much for the River $word$ Towns &s;tanding upon it, and $word$ on the North Shore or Bank are but $word$ at lea&s;t of Note: Beg$nning at the $word$ of it&punc; and going up the Stream, $span$ Towns, &s;uch as Burton, Stockwith&punc; $word$ borough, and Newark, are on the $word$ Bank, and con&s;equently have been $word$ to already.

<P>Nottingham is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;$$t and beautiful Towns in England $span$ S$tuation makes it &s;o, tho' the $word$ $o it were not to be nam'd It is $word$ on the Side of a Hill overlooking a $word$ Range of Meadows about a Mile $roa$, a $$$tle Rivulet running on the North Side of the Meadows, almo&s;t clo&s;e to the Town; and the noble River Trent paral|$$l with both on the further or South $word$ of the Meadows: Ove$ th Trent $ere is a &s;tately Stone-Bridge of nineteen $rches and the River being the$e joined $word$ one united Stream, is very large and $word$ having, as is &s;aid, but lately $word$ the Addition of the Dove&punc; the $erwent&punc; the I$wa&s;h, and the the So$r, $word$ of them very great Rivers of them|$ves, and all coming into the Trent $word$ its pa&s;&s;ing by Burton in Stafford&s;hire $$ntioned before,</P>
<P>The Town of Nottingham is &s;ituated on the &s;tep A&s;cent of a &s;andy Rock; $word$ is con&s;equently remarkable, for $t it is &s;o &s;oft that they ea&s;ily work in|$it for making Vaults and Cellars, and $ &s;o firm as to &s;upport the Roofs of $word$ Cellars two or three under one $word$ the S$airs into which, are all cut $word$ of the &s;olid, tho' crumbling Rock&punc; $word$ we mu&s;t not fail to have it be remem|ed that the bountiful Inhabitants gene|rally keep the&s;e Cellars well &s;tock'd with excel$ent ALE; nor are they uncommuni|cative in be&s;towing it among their Friends, as &s;ome in out Company experienc'd to a degree not fit to be made matter of Hi|&s;tory</P>
<P>They tell us there&punc; &s;peaking of the An|tiquity of Nottinham, that the Hill where ii was built, was called the Dolo|rous Hill, or the Go$go$na of ancient time; becau&s;e of a gr$$ Slaughter of the B$itans the$e by King Humbe$, a Nor|thern Mon$$ch $he &s;ame who, $ei g af|te$$$$ds drowned in the Pa&s;&s;$ge of the Sea betwr$n $ull and B$$ton, gave name to $word$ Arm of the Sea which is now c lled $he Humbe$, and $word$ re$$ives $word$ $word$ and almo&s;t $word$ the great $word$ of Y$$k&s;hire into it.</P>

old Ca&s;tle, but when, we know not; &s;o that if we may plead its Antiquity 'tis only becau&s;e we have no Account of of its Beginning; the olde&s;t thing that we read of it is, that there was a Tower here which the Danes ob&s;tinately defended again&s;t King Alfred, and his Brother Aethelred.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;tle, or &s;ome other Building in the Room of it, remained till the Time of the late Wars; 'tis evident it was &s;tanding in the Queen Elizabeth; Mr. Cambden &s;ays, William the Norman built it; and, as he &s;ays, it was done to awe the Engli&s;h; it was &s;o &s;trong that nothing could ever reduce it but Famine; after this it was repair'd and beautified, or ra|ther rebuilt by Edward IV. who added fine Apartments to it, which Richard III. his Brother inlarged.</P>
<P>It was &s;o &s;trong, it &s;eems, that it had not been &s;ubject to the ordinary fate of other fortified Places; namely, to be of|ten taken and retaken; for it was never &s;torm'd, that is to &s;ay, never taken Sword in Hand; once it was indeed taken by Surprize in the Barons Wars by Robert Earl Ferrers, who al&s;o plundered the Town, (City 'twas then call'd.)</P>
<P>The &s;tories that People tells us here, of one of the Davids, King of Scotland, kept Pri&s;oner in it, I believe little of, any more than I do that of Roger Mor|timer Earl of March, and his being hid in a Vault under Ground in this Ca&s;tle, whence being di&s;covered, he was taken, brought to Ju&s;tice, and hang'd for Trea|&s;on; yet the Place where they &s;ay he was taken, is &s;hewed &s;till to Strangers, and is call'd Mortimers Hole, to this Day. It is true, that here are &s;uch Places, Mr. Camden al&s;o gives an Account that in the fir&s;t Court of the Ca&s;tle there is a way down by a great many &s;teps to a Vault under Ground, where there are Chambers cut out of the Stone, a$d $word$ People offer'd to carry us down $word$ did not like the A&s;pect of it, $o we $word$ rather to take their words.</P>
<P>Whoever built this great Ca&s;tle $word$ the Di&s;pute lies only between William the Conqueror and William de $word$ his Ba&s;tard Son) I &s;ay, whoever built $word$ we know not; but we know who $word$ it down; namely, the Government, up|on the Re&s;toration, becau&s;e it had been forfeited, and held out again&s;t the R$$$l|i&s;ts: After the Re&s;toration Caven$i&s;h late Marqui&s;s of Newca&s;tle, entirely $word$ it of King Charles II. or of the D k$ of Buckingham, to whom he would h$$e &s;old it; and, having bought it, went to work immediately with $span$ it quite down; for it lay, as it $word$ wa&s;t to him, and u&s;ele&s;s. In the Year 1647 he cleared the old Foundation$&punc; a &s;mall Part excepted, and f$u$d$d $word$ noble Structure which we &s;ee now $word$ and which, thro' &s;everal Succe&s;&s;ions&punc; h$s revolved the pre&s;ent Branch of the $span$ of Pelham, now Duke of $word$ who has beautified if not enlarg$d the Building, and has laid out a Plan of the fine&s;t Gardens that are to be &s;een $word$ that part of England, but they are $word$ yet fini&s;h'd, they take up, as they tell us, three&s;core Acres of Ground in the De&s;ign, and would, no doubt&punc; be exq$$|&s;itely fine; but it requires an imm$$$e &s;um to go on with it.</P>

<P>The Beauties of Nottingham, next to $word$ Situation&punc; are the Ca&s;tle, the Market|$ace, and the Gardens of Count Tallard; $h$, in his Confinement here as $word$ of War taken by the Duke of Marl&punc; $orough at the great Battle of Bleacheim, $$u&s;ed him&s;elf with making a &s;mall, but beautiful <HI>Parterre,</HI> after the French $a&s;h$on.

<P>There was once a hand&s;ome Town|$$a&s;e here for the Se&s;&s;ions or A&s;&s;izes, $d other publick Bu&s;ine&s;s; but at was $yr old, and was either &s;o weak, or $word$ ill looked after, that, being over|$owded upon Occa&s;ion of the A&s;&s;iz$s $me Years &s;ince, it cracked, and fright$d $e People, and that not without Cau&s;e. $s it happened no Body was hurt, nor $d the Building fall directly down. But $word$ mu&s;t be &s;aid, (J think) that Provi|$nce had more care of the Judges, and $eir needful Attendants, than the Town&s;|$en had, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to have $en well a&s;&s;ured of the Place, before $ey &s;uffered a Throng of People to $me into it; and therefore we cannot $uy, but it was a &s;ea&s;onable Ju&s;tice in $e Court to Amerce or Fine the Town, $word$ they did; as well for the Omi&s;&s;ion, $word$ for the Repair of the Place. We are $ld now that they are collecting Money, $t for the Repair of the old Hou&s;e, $t for erecting a new one, which will $d to the beauty of the Town.</P>
<P>The Trent is Navigable here for Ve&s;|s or Barges of great burthen, by which $word$ their heavy and bulky Goods are $ought from the Humber, and even from $word$ &s;uch as Iron.

<P>When I &s;aid the Bridge over Trent had nineteen Arches, I might as well have &s;aid the Bridge was a Mile long; for the Trent being, at the la&s;t time I was there, &s;welled over its ordinary Bound, the Ri|ver reached quate up the Town; yet a high $an$$way with Arches at proper Di$$a$ces, carried us dry over the whole brca$$ of the Meauows, which, I think, is at lea&s;t a $word$ and it may be ju&s;tly called a Bridge, on &s;everal Accounts, as another at Swar&s;ton is called, which is full a M$$e in length.</P>
<P>Nottingham, notwith&s;tanding the Na|vigation of the Trent, is not e&s;teemed a Town of very great Trade, other than as u&s;ual to Inland Towns; the chief Ma|nufacture carried on here is Frame work Knitting for Stockings, the &s;ame as at Leice&s;ter, and &s;ome Gla&s;s, and Earthen Ware-hou&s;es; the latter much increa&s;ed &s;ince the increa&s;e of Tea Drinking; for the making &s;ine Stone Mugs, Tea Pots, Cups, &amp;c. the Gla&s;s-Hou&s;es, I think, are of late rather decayed.</P>
<P>As there is a fine Market-place, &s;o is there a very good Market, with a va&s;t plenty of Provi&s;ions, and tho&s;e of the be&s;t &s;ort, few Towns in England ex|ceeding it; to &s;ay nothing of their Ale, as having re&s;erved it to a Place by it+&s;elf.</P>
<P>As they Brew very good Liquor here, &s;o they make the be&s;t Malt, and the mo&s;t of it any of Town in this Part of Eng|land, which they drive a great Trade for, &s;ending it by Land-Carriage to Der|by, through all the Peak as far as Man|che&s;ter, and to other Towns in Lanca&s;hire, Che&s;hire, and even into York&s;hire it&s;elf; to which End all the Lower Lands of this County, and e&s;pecially on the Banks of Trent, yield prodigious Crops of Barley.</P>

<P>I might enter into a long De&s;cription of all the modern Buildings erected lately in Nottingham, which are con&s;iderable, and of &s;ome ju&s;t now going forward. But I have a large Building in the whole to overlook; and I mu&s;t not dwell too long upon the Thre&s;hold.</P>
<P>The Fore&s;t of Sherwood is an Additi|on to Nottingham for the Plea&s;ure of Hu$$$, and there are al&s;o &s;ome &s;ine Parks and $word$ Hou&s;es in it, as Welbeck, the late Duke of Newca&s;tli's, and Thores|by, the pre&s;ent noble Seat of the Pierre|pont's, Dukes of King&s;ton, which lies at the farthe&s;t Edge of the Fore&s;t. But this Fore&s;t does not add to the Frui$fulne&s;s of the County for 'tis now, as it were, gi|ven up to Wa&s;te; even the Woods which formerly made it &s;o famous for Thieves, are wa&s;ted; and if there was &s;uch a Man as Robin Hood, a famous Out-Law and Deer &s;tealer, that &s;o many Years harbour|ed here, he would hardly find Shelter for one Week, If he was now to have been there: Nor is there any &s;tore of Deer, compared to the Quantity which in for|mer Times they tell us there u&s;ually was.</P>
<P>From Nottingham, a little Mile We&s;t on the Road to Derby, we &s;aw Woolla|ton Hall, the noble&s;t antient-built Palace in this Counry, the Man&s;ion of the anti|ent Family of Willoughby now Lord Middleton, created Baron in the late Queen Anne's Time. The Hou&s;e, the Gardens, the great Hall, the Monuments of the Family in the Church of Woolla|ton, and the Pedigree of that Noble Fa|mily, are well worth a Stranger's View.</P>
<P>The Park, walled in with a new Brlek-Wall, is much finer than the great Park adjoining to the Ca&s;tle of Nottingham, being much better planted with Timber; whereas that at Nottingham was all cut down, and &s;eque&s;tred in the late Wart.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e, all of Stone, was $word$ by Sir Francis Willoughby, &s;econd Son $f the Honourable&mdash;Willoughby $word$ &s;lain in the 4th of Edward VI. $n the Rebellion or Tumult at Norwich, An$$ 1546, and Dame Anne, Daughter of the Marqui&s;s of Dorche&s;ter; the full and elde&s;t Son, Sir Thomas Willoughby, dy|ing unmarried.

The Figure of Building, as an Artist $word$ $f it to me, was rarher Antick than Ant$$nt; the Architect is noble, and the Order of Building regular, except the four Pa$$$|ons of the Dorick on the Top, which they alledge is inexcu&s;able in Architecture. Some, who excu&s;e the De&s;ign, will have it to be, that the upper Building is an Ae|tick, and &s;$t &s;$t on to grace the $word$ But I mu&s;t be allowed to differ from $word$ Opinion too,</P>
<P>However it be, take it all together, the Building is far beyond any Thing in $word$ Part of England, of equal $word$ B$$voir, or Beveir Da&s;tle excepted, $word$ even not that for Excellence of Work|man&s;hip.</P>

<P>I re&s;olved indeed fir&s;t for the $eak, which lay on my Left hand North Ea&s;t; $ut, as I &s;ay, to leave as little behind me $s po&s;&s;ible, I was obliged to make a l ttle Excur&s;ion into the Fore&s;t, where, in my Way, I had the Diver&s;ion of &s;eeing the $word$ Meeting of the Gentry at the Hor&s;e Races near Nottingham. I could give a long and agreeable Account of the Sport it &s;elf, how it brought into my $houghts the Olympick Games among the Greeks; and the Circus Maximus at Rome; where the Racers made a great $word$ and the Victors made great Boa&s;ts and Triumphs: But where they chie&s;ly $word$ in Chariots, not much unlike our $hai&s;es, and where nothing of the Speed, or of Skill in Hor&s;eman&s;hip could be $hown, as is in our Races.</P>
<P>It is true, in tho&s;e Races the young Roman and Grecian Gentlemen rod, or ather drove them&s;elves; whereas in our Races the Hor&s;es, not the Riders, make the Show; and they are generally rid|den by Grooms and Boys, chiefly for lightne&s;s; &s;ometimes indeed the Gentle|men ride them&s;e&s;elves, as I have often &s;een the Duke of Monmouth, natural Son to King Charles II&punc; ride his own Hor&s;es at a Match, and win it too, tho' he was a large Man, and mu&s;t weigh heavy.</P>
<P>But the Illu&s;trious Company at the Not|tingham Races was, in my Opinion, the Glory of the Day, for there we &s;aw, be|&s;ides eleven or twelve Noblemen, an in|&s;i ite Throng of Gentlemen from all the Conatries round, nay, even out of Scot|land it&s;elf; the Appearance, in my Opi|nion, $span$ as it w$ really m$e nu|merous, $word$ ever I &s;aw at Newmarket&punc; except wh $ the King have been there in Ceremony; for I cannot but &s;ay, that in King Chales $word$ Time, wh $ his Ma|je&s;ty u&s;ed to be frequently at Newmarket. I have known the $span$ there have been with far le&s;s Company than this at Nottingham; and, if I might go back to one of the&s;e Nottingham Meetings, when the Mare$chal Duke d$ $word$ was there, I &s;hould &s;ay, that no Occa&s;ions at New|marker, in my M$mo y, ever came up to it, except the fir&s;t time that king William was there after the Peace of Ry$wick.</P>
<P>Nor is the Appearance of the Ladies to be omitted, as fine and without Com|pari&s;on more Bright and Gay, tho' they might a little fall &s;hort in Number of the many Thou&s;ands of Nobility and Gentry of the other Sex; in &s;hort, the Tram of Coaches filled with the Beauties of the North was not to be de&s;cribed; except we were to &s;peak of the Garden of the Tul|leries at Paris, or the Pa$do at Mexico, where they tell us there are 4 $word$ Coaches with &s;ix Hor&s;es each, every Evening tak|ing the Air.</P>
<P>From hence I was going on to &s;ee Rugford Abbey, the &s;ine Seat of the late Marqui&s;s of Hallifax, but was called a&s;ide to take a View of the mo&s;t famous piece of Church Hi&s;tory in this Part of the
<PB REF="348">
whole I&s;land, I mean the Collegiate Church of Southwell.</P>
<P>Paulinus, Archbi&s;hop of York, was (&s;o ancient Record &s;upplies the Tale) the Founder of this Church, having preached to the People of the country round, aud babtized them in the River Trent; the antient Word imports chri&s;|tianized them, by dipping them in the River Trent. Whether our Antipedo-Bapti&s;ts will take any Advantage of the Word. I know not; but I cannot &s;ee any Doubt but that antiently Bapti&s;m was performed in the Water; whether it was performed there by Immer&s;ion, put|ting the Per&s;on into the Water, or pour|ing the Water upon him, we know not; neither do I $$e any extraordinary, much le&s;s any e&s;&s;ential Difference in it, be it one way or the other; but that is not my bu&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pecially not here: The rea&s;on of naming it, is to give you the pious Occa&s;ion which made the good Bi&s;hop build this Church, namely, that having converted a whole Province, or Part of one at lea&s;t, he was de&s;irous they &s;hould not want a Place of Wor&s;hip to &s;erve God in.</P>
<P>The Thing which makes this $word$ the more remarkable, $span$ it was &s;urrendered into the King' $word$ with all the re&s;t of the religious $word$ in the Reign of King Henry VIII. yet it was re&s;tored wh$$e a$ it was before, in the 35th of the &s;ane Reign.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e I love to &s;peak not from my &s;elf in Ca&s;es where good $word$ are to be had, and that in $span$ View of a Place, &s;uch as that of a $word$ mu&s;t be, the Out&s;ides or Appearan es of Things only are to be &s;een, or &s;uch farther Knowledge as may be obtained by report of inhabitants; for I copy $word$ thing from Books, but where I qu$$e t$e Books, and refer to them; I &s;ay, $$r this Rea&s;on I give you an Account of this venerable Pile, its Foundation and pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, from a Rever$$d and very good Friend, and one of the pre&s;ent Prebendaries of the Place, and who&s;e Authority I do, and the Reader may depend upon, as follows, viz.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>An Account of the <HI>TOWN</HI> and <HI>CHURCH</HI> of <HI>SOUTHWELL</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOUTHWELL, in the County of Nottingham, is about nine Miles North Ea&s;t from Nottingham, four Miles We&s;t from Newark, eight South Ea&s;t from Mansfield, and about two South We&s;t the River Trent. The &s;oil of it rich Clay and Marle; the Air very good, and well watered; the River Greet runs by it. It is a Market Town, and the Market Day Saturday; it is remarkable for no &s;ort of Manufacture.</P>
<P>There is in it but one Church, which is both Parochial and Collegiate; which, I think, is the ca&s;e of no other in Eng|land, except Rippon in York&s;hire.</P>
<P>The Pari&s;h con&s;i&s;ts of Southwell, and the Hamlets of Ea&s;trope, which joins to Southwell on the Ea&s;t; We&s;trope, about a quarter of a Mile We&s;t of South|well; and Normanton, about a Mile North; it contains about 350 Families. There is a Pari&s;h-Vicar &s;o called, $word$ is generally one of the Vicars $word$ who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to vi&s;it the $word$ bury the Death, &amp;c. the Preaching $word$ being performed by the Prebendaries. This Vicarage was lately augmented by Q Annc's Bounty, which Benefit $ell to it by Lot.</P>
<P>The Collegiate Church con&s;i&s;ts $word$ Prebendaries or Canons, 6 Vicars Cho|ral, an Organi&s;t, 6 Singing-Men, 6 Cho|ri&s;ters, a Regi&s;ter to the Chapter, a Trea|&s;urer, an Auditor, a Verger, &amp;c. The Prebends are all in the Gift of the A$$$|bi&s;hop of Yo$k. All the re&s;t of the Members di&s;po&s;ed of by the Chap|ter.</P>
<P>The Foundation of this church $word$ doubtle&s;s very antient. It is generally
<PB REF="349">
&s;uppo&s;ed to be founded by Paulinus&punc; the fir&s;t Archbi&s;hop of York, about the Year 63$.</P>
<P>The Church was, by the &s;everal Mem|$ers thereof, viz. the Archbi&s;hop, the Pr$hendaries, Vicars Choral, Chantry Prie&s;ts, and by the Chapter, &s;urrendered to the King, 32 Henry VIII. as appears by the Records in Chancery; and was actually in $he King's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, un$il by Act $f Parliament, Anno 35 Henry VIII. it was $word$ and re&s;tored to its $ncient $word$ and incorporated by the Name <HI>of $he $hapter of the Col egiate Church of the Ble$$ed Mary the Virgin $f South|wi$$.</HI></P>
<P>Afterward, by the Statute for the Di&s;|&s;olution of Ch$ntries, Anno Primo Edw. V$ $t was conceived, that the $aid Church $as $span$ d$$olved. But the Members of the Church di$ not quit their Po&s;|$e&s;tion $word$ the 4th and 5th of Philip and Mary, wh$n&mdash;Gr$$$in, the Attor|ney Ge$eral&punc; exhibited an information of $word$ again&s;t the Chapter, plead|ing the $word$ Title to their Lands, by virtue of the Act of Edward VI. But upon full Hearing it was adjudged that the C$$pter was not adjudged w$thin the &s;aid Statute; and therefore the Bill was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and the Chapter continued to enjoy their Rights and Privileges.</P>
<P>Queen Elizabeth confirmed the &s;ame, $nd gave Statutes to the &s;aid church, with this Preamble: <HI>Eliz. $word$ Grat. $word$ &amp;c. Dilectis &s;u$ditis no&s;tris, $word$ caeteri&s;q; Mini&s;tris Ec$le&s;iae $word$ Colleg. Beatae Maria Virginis Sout$will per Illu&s;tri&s;&s;imum Patrem $rum</HI> Hen. VIII. <HI>nuper Regem $word$</HI> Notwith&s;tanding this, in King $word$ Reign, the &s;ame Plea was re|$ed again&s;t the church, by the then $orney General, and met with the $word$ Succe&s;s; that is, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. $word$ King James, in the &s;econd Year of Reign, by Letters Patents under the at Seal, confirmed and e&s;tabli&s;hed the $word$ church in perpetuity, according to the Refoundation and Re&s;titution thereof by King Henry VIII.</P>
<P>There is no Dean of this church; but the Re&s;identiary for the Time be|ing has the Government of it; and one of the Prebendaries, by the Satutes, is obliged to be Re&s;ident, which at pre|&s;ent is by agreement and con&s;ent of the Archbi&s;hop, performed by every one in in their Turns, and each Prebendary keep Re&s;idence a Qu$rter of a Year.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the $$ebendaries, I think 12 of them have P$$b$ndal Hou&s;es in the Town of S$u$hwell. But tho&s;e being l$t out on Lea&s;e, they now keep Re&s;i|dence in a $ou&s;e built for that purpo&s;e about $word$ Years ago, at the Ea&s;t End of the Col$ege of the V$$ars; which Hou&s;e is ready fur$$&s;hed, and kept in Repair at the charge of the Chapter</P>
<P>The Prebendaries preach in their Turn every Sunday Mo$$ing, and on &s;uch Fe&s;ti|vals &amp;c. as Preaching is required. In the Afternoon on Sundays there is a Lecture u$ua$$y preached by the Re&s;iden|tiary for the Time being.</P>
<P>The Chapter of Southwell have a pe|culiar J$ri$diction, and there are 28 Pa|ri&s;hes &s;ubject to it; to mo&s;t of which they have the Right of Pre&s;entation; be&s;ides &s;ome others in Lincoln&s;hire and York&s;hire. This Juri&s;diction is exerci&s;ed by a Commi&s;&s;ary or Vicar-General, cho|&s;en by the Chapter out of their Body, who holds Ve&s;itations, &amp;c. twice a Year. And be&s;ides the&s;e, the&s;e are two Synods yearly, to which all the Clergy of the Country of Not$ingham pay their At|tendance. And a certain Number of the Prebendaries, and others of the con&s;ider|able Clergy, are appointed Commi&s;&s;ion|ers, by a Commi&s;&s;ion granted by the Archbi&s;hop of York to pre&s;ide at the Synods.</P>
<P>There are many Privileges belonging to this church; one of which is, That every Pari&s;h and Hamlet in the county pay certain &s;mall Pen&s;ions yearly to the church, called Penteco&s;tal Offer|ings.</P>
<P><PB REF="350">
There are Hou&s;es for the Vicars Choral adjoining to the Re&s;idence Hou&s;e, built about a Square; with a Gate locked up every Night, and the Key kept by the Re&s;identiary. There are but five of the Vicars have Hou&s;es allotted them in the College. The other Vicar, being Pari&s;h Vicar al&s;o has a Vicarage Hou&s;e in the Town. There are Prayers twice every Day at the u&s;ual Hours, and likewi&s;e at &s;ix or &s;even in the Morning, from A&s;h-Wedne&s;day to St. Matthew's Day.</P>
<P>The Civil Government of the Juri&s;dic|tion of Southwell, is di&s;tinct from the County at large. It is called the Soke of Southwell cum Scrooby, which is another Town in this County. There are abou 20 Towns &s;ubject to this Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tos Rotulorum, and the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, are nominated by the Arch|bi&s;hop of York, and con&s;tituted by a Commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal of Eng|land; who hold their Se&s;&s;ion both at Southwell and Scrooby, and perform all other Ju&s;ticiary Acts di&s;tinct from the County. There is no Cu&s;tos Rotula$ $word$ yet appointed in the Room of Lord L$$|ingron, who died about two Years $word$ but a New Commi&s;&s;ion is expected $word$ &s;oon as the Archbi&s;hop is confirmed</P>

<P>The Fabrick of the Church is at pre|&s;ent in good and decent Order. It is a &s;trong Building of the Gothick Order, very plain. I remember to have met with this Pa&s;&s;age in &s;ome of our old Writings; That when the Di&s;pute was about the Di&s;&s;olution of the Church, I think in King James's Reign; among other Things, it was urged by the Chapter, that the Church of Southwell was a plain Fabrick, free from all &s;uper&s;titious Ornaments; that there were no painted Figures in the Gla&s;s-Work, nor Images, nor &s;o much as a Nitch capable of placing an Image in; which I think is true. And from hence too it has been conjectur'd concerning
<PB REF="351">
$he Antiquity of this Church, that it was $robably built, before Image-Wor&s;hip was $racti&s;ed or thought of in the Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>This Church was a great Part of it burnt down in the Year 1711 by Light|ning; of which I find this Memorandum in one of our Books, viz. On Monday the 5th of November, 1711&punc; about Ten o'Clock at Night, the Top of the Ball on one of the South Spires of this Collegiate Church of Southwell was fired by Light|ning; which, backed by a furious Wind that drove it almo&s;t directly on the Body of the Church, in a few Hours burnt down the Spire and Roof, melted down the Bells, and &s;pared nothing that was combu&s;tible, except the other Spire, till it came to the Quire, where, after it had con&s;umed the Orgains, it was by &s;ingular Providence &s;topt and extingui&s;h'd</P>
<P>This is a pretty exact Account; to which I mu&s;t add, that the Damage was computed at near 4000 l. which great M$$fortune was happily repaired by the In|du&s;try of the Chapter, joined with the help of the then Archbi&s;hop of York, Dr. Sharp; who not only contributed largely them&s;elves, but by their Solicita|tions obtained a Brief, which, with the $$$ral Contributions of &s;everal of the Nobility and Gentry, and the Inhabitants of Southwell and its Neighbourhood, en|abled them to repair the Church, and to put it in as good Order as it was before the Fire,</P>
<P>Among the Benefactors ought particu|larly to be remembered with Gratitude the late Dutche&s;s Dowager of Newca&s;tle, who, at the Interce&s;&s;ion of the Arch|bi&s;hop, kindly &s;econded by her Chaplain Dr. Brailsford, now Dean of Wells, l.</P>

<P>Hence cro&s;&s;ing the Fore&s;t I came to Mansfield, a Market Town, but with|$ut any Remarkables In my Way I $i&s;ited the noble Seat of the Duke of $$wca&s;tle at Walbeck, and the Marqui&s;s $word$ Hallifax at Rufford, or Rugeford Ab|$y, all very noble Seats, tho' ancient, $word$ that at Welbeck e&s;pecially, beauti|$d with large Additions, fine Apart|$ents, and good Gardens; but particu|larly the Park, well &s;tocked with large Timber, and the fine&s;t Kind, as well as the large&s;t Quantity of Deer that are any where to be &s;een; for the late Duke's Delight being chiefly on Hor&s;eback and in the Chace, it is not to be wondered if he rather made his Parks fine than his Gardens, and his Stables than his Man|&s;ion-Hou&s;e; yet the Hou&s;e is noble, large, and magnificent.</P>
<P>Hard by Welbeck is Wirk&s;op Mannor, the antient and &s;tately Seat of the no|ble Family of Talbot, de&s;cended by a long Line of Ance&s;tors from another Family Illu&s;trious, though not enobled (of Love$o$'s.) This Hou&s;e, (tho' in its ancient Figure) is outdone by none of the be&s;t and greate&s;t in the County, except Wollaton Hall, already mention|ed; and that though it is, as it were, de&s;erted of its noble Patrons; the Fami|ly of Shrewsbury being in the Per&s;on of the la&s;t Duke, removed from this &s;ide of the Country to another fine Seat in the We&s;t, already mentioned.</P>
<P>From hence leaving Nottingham&s;hire, the We&s;t Part abounding with Lead and Coal, I cro&s;s'd over that Fury of a Ri|ver called the Derwent, and came to Derby, the Capital of the County. This is a fine, beautiful, and plea&s;ant Town; it has more Families of Gentlemen in it than is u&s;ual in Towns &s;o remote and therefore here is a great deal of good, and &s;ome gay Company: Perhaps the ra|ther, becau&s;e the Peak being &s;o $ear, and taking up the larger Part of the County, and being &s;o inho&s;pitable, &s;o rugged and &s;o wild a Place, the Gentry choo&s;e to re&s;ide at Derby, rather than upon their E&s;tates, as they do in other places.</P>
<P><PB REF="354">
It mu&s;t be allowed, that the twelve Miles between Nottingham and this Town, keeping the mid-way between the Trent on the Left, and the Mountains on the Right, are as agreeable with re&s;pect to the Situation, the Soil, and the well plant|ing of the Country, as any Spot of Ground, at lea&s;t that I have &s;een of that Length, in England.</P>
<P>The Town of Derby is &s;ituated on the We&s;t Bank of the Derwent, over which it has a very fine Bridge, well built, but antient, and a Chapel upon the Bridge, now converted into a Dwelling-Hou&s;e. Here is a Curio&s;ity in Trade worth ob|&s;erving, as being the only one of its Kind in England, namely, a Throwing or Throw&s;ter's Mill, which performs by a Wheel turn'd by the Water; and though it cannot perform the Doubling Part of a Throw&s;ter's Work, which can only be done by a Hand-wheel, yet it turns the other Work, and performs the Labour of many Hands. Whether it an&s;wers the Expence or not, that is not my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>This Work was erected by one Soracole, a Man expert in making Mill-Work, e&s;|pecially for rai&s;ing Water to &s;upply Towns for Family U&s;e: But he made a very odd Experiment at this Place; for going to &s;hew &s;ome Gentlemen the Curio&s;ity, as he called it, of his Mill and cro&s;&s;ing the Planks which lay ju&s;t above the Mill-Wheel; regarding, it &s;eems, what he was to &s;hew his Friends more than the Place where he was, and too eager in de&s;crib|ing Things, keeping his Eye rather up|on what he pointed at with his Fingers, than what he &s;tept upon with his Feet, he &s;tepp'd away and &s;lipt into the River.</P>
<P>He was &s;o very clo&s;e to the Sluice which let the Water out upon the Wheel, and which was then pulled up, that tho' Help was ju&s;t at hand, there was no tak|ing hold of him, till by the Force of the Water he was carried through, and pu&s;h+ed ju&s;t under the large Wheel, which was then going round at a great Rate. The Body being thus forc'd in between two of the Pla&s;hers of the Wheel, &s;topt the M$|tion for a little while, till the Water pu&s;hing hard to force its Way, the Pla&s;h|er beyond him gave way and broke; up|on which the Wheel went again, a$$ like Jonah's Whale, &s;pewed him out, not upon dry Land but into that Part they call the Apron, and &s;o to the Mill $word$, where he was taken up, and received $word$ Hurt at all.</P>
<P>Derby, as I have &s;aid, is a Town of Gentry, rather than Trade; yet it is po|pulous, well built, has five Pari&s;hes, a large Market place, a fine Town-Hou&s;e, and very hand&s;ome Streets.</P>
<P>In the Church of Allhallows, or, as the Spaniards call it, De Todos los $word$, All Saints, is the Pantheon, or Burial-Place of the noble, now Ducal Family of Cavendi&s;h, now Devon&s;hire, which was fir&s;t erected by the Counte&s;s of Shrews|bury, who not only built the Vault o$ Sepulchre, but an Ho&s;pital for eight $word$ Men and four Women, clo&s;e by the Church, and &s;ettled their mainte$$$$, which is continued to this Day: Here are very magnificent monuments for the Fa|mily of Cavendi&s;h; and at this Church is a famous Tower or Steeple, which for the Heighth and beauty of its Building, is not equalled in this county, or in any of tho&s;e adjacent.</P>
<P>By an In&s;cription upon this Church, it was erected, or at lea&s;t the Steeple, at the charge of the Maids and Batchelors of $word$ Town; on which Account, wh$$ever&punc; Maid, Native of the Town, was marry'd&punc; the Bells were Rung by batchelors: H$ long the cu&s;tom la&s;ted, we do not read, but I do not find that it is continued, at lea&s;t not &s;ttictly.</P>
<P>The Government of this Town, for it is a corporation, and &s;ends two Burge&s;&s;es to Parlam$nt, is in a Mayor, High Steward, nine Aldermen, a Recorder, fourteen Brothers, fourteen capital Burge&s;&s;es, and a Town Clerk: The Trade of the Town is chiefly in good Malt and good Ak|nor is the Quanity of the latter unrea&s;o|nably &s;mall, which, as they &s;ay, they

<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that as the Trent makes $e Frontier or Bounds of the County Derby South, &s;o the Dove and the Er|$&s;h make the Bounds Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and $e Derwent runs through the center; all them beginning and ending their conr&s;e $ the &s;ame county; for they ri&s;e in the $ak, and end in the Trent.</P>
<P>I that had read Cotton's Wonders of the $ak, in which I always wondered more $word$ the Poetry than at the Peak, and in $h $h there was much good Humour, tho' $word$ little good Ver&s;e, could not &s;atisfy my $lf to be in Derby&s;hire, and not &s;ee the $iver Dove, which that Gentleman has $ent &s;o much Doggerel upon, and cele|$ated to &s;uch a degree for Trout and $word$ So from Derby we went to $eve-Bridge, or, as the Country People $$l it. Dowbridge, where we had the $lea&s;ure to &s;ee the River drowning the $ow-Grounds by a &s;udden Shower, and $a&s;t$ing to the Trent with a mo&s;t outra|$$$us Stream, in which there being no $eat Diver&s;ion, and travelling being not $ery &s;afe in a rainy Sea&s;on on that Side, $e omitted &s;eeing A&s;hbourn and Uttoxe|$er, the Utocetum of the Antients, two $$$$ket Towns upon that River, and re|$ur$ing towards Derby, we went from $$$nce directly up into the High Peak.</P>
<P>In our Way we pa&s;t an antient Seat, $word$ but not very gay, of Sir Nathaniel $word$ a noted and (for Wealth) over $$at Family, for many Ages Inhabitants $word$ this County. Hence we kept the Der|$ent on our Right-hand, but kept our Di&s;tance, the Waters being out; for the Derwent is a frightful Creature when the Hills load her Current with Water; I &s;ay, we kept our Di&s;tance, and contented our $elves with hearing the roaring of its Wa|$ers, till we came to Quarn or Quarden, $word$ little ragged, but noted Village, where there is a famous Chalybeat Spring, to which abundance of People go in the Sea|$on to drink the Water, as al&s;o a Cold Bath. There are al&s;o &s;everal other Mi|neral Waters in this Part of the Country$ as another Chalybeat near Quarden or Quarn, a hot Bath at Matlock, and ano|ther at Buxton, of which in its Place; be|&s;ides the&s;e, there are hot Springs in &s;everal Places which run wa&s;te into the Ditches and Brooks, and are taken no ontice of, being remote among the Mountains, and out of the Way of the common re&s;ort.</P>
<P>We found the Wells, as Cu&s;tom bids us call them, pretty full of Company, the Waters good, and very phy&s;ical, but wretched Lodging and Entertainment; &s;o I re&s;olved to &s;tay till I came to the South, and make &s;hift with Tu$bridge or Ep&s;om, of which I have &s;poken at large in the Counties of Surrey and Kent.</P>
<P>From Quarden we advanced due North, and, mounting the Hills gradually for four or five Miles, we &s;oon had a mo&s;t frightful View indeed among the black Mountains of the Peak; however, as they were yet at a Di&s;tance, and a good Town lay on our Left called Wirk&s;worth, we turned thither for Refre&s;hment; Here indeed we found a Specimen of what I had heard before, (viz.) that however rugged the Hills were, the Vales were every where fruitful, well inhabited, the Markets well &s;upplied, and the Provi&s;ions extraordinary good; not forgetting the Ale, which every where exceeded, if po&s;|&s;ible, what was pa&s;s'd, as if the farther North the better the Liquor, and that the nearer we approach'd to York&s;hire, as the Place for the be&s;t, &s;o the Ale advanc'd the nearer to its Perfection.</P>
<P>Wirk&s;worth is a large well-frequented Market Town, and Market Towns be|ing very thin placed in this Part of the Country, they have the better Trade, the People generally coming twelve or fifteen Miles to a Market, and &s;ometimes much more; though there is no very great Trade to this Town but what relaies to the Lead Works, and to the &s;ubterranean Wretches, who they call Peakrills, who work in the Mines, and who live all round this Town every way.</P>
<P><PB REF="356">
The inhabitants are a rude boori&s;h kind of People, but they are a bold, daring, and even de&s;perate kind of Fel|lows in their &s;earch into the Bowels of the Earth; for no People in the World out-do them; and therefore they are of|ten entertained by our Engineers in the Wars to carry on the Sap, and other &s;uch Works, at the Sieges of &s;trong fortified Places.</P>
<P>This Town of Wirk&s;worth is a kind of a Market for Lead; the like not known any where el&s;e that I know of, except it be at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Keys in London. The Barmoot-Court, kept here to judge Controver&s;ies among the Miners, that is to &s;ay, to adju&s;t &s;ubterranean Quarrels and Di&s;putes, is very remarkable: Here they &s;ummon a Ma&s;ter and twenty-four Jurors, and they have Power to &s;et out the Bounds of the Works under Ground, the Terms are the&s;e, they are empow|ered to &s;et off the Meers (&s;o they call them) of Ground in a Pipe and a Flat, that is to &s;ay, twenty-nine Yards long in the fir&s;t, and fourteen Square in the la&s;t; when any Man has found a Vein of Oar in another Man's Ground, except Orchards and $word$ $span$ point the Proprietor $span$ for Timber, $span$ pre&s;cribes Rules to the $span$ their Proceedings $span$ under Ground; al&s;o they $span$ all their little Quarrel&punc; $span$ the Mines as well as ou$, $span$ keeps the Peace among $span$ by the way, may be called he $span$ of all the Wonders of the $span$ are of a &s;trange, turbulent, $span$ temper, and very hard to $span$ to one another in their $span$ fairs.</P>

$on find all that is wonderful about $word$</P>
<P>Near Wirk&s;worth, and upon the very $dge of Derwent, is, as above, a Vil|$$ge called Matlock, where there are &s;e|$eral warm Springs, lately one of the&s;e $ein$ &s;ecured by a Stone Wall on every $word$ by which the Water is brought to $word$ to a due heighth, is made into a ve|$$ convenient Bath; with a Hou&s;e built $span$ it, and room within the Building to $word$ round the Water or Bath, and &s;o $word$ &s;t p$ to go down gradually into $word$</P>
<P>Th$$ B$$h would be much more $word$ $word$ it is, if two things did $span$ a ba&s;e, &s;tony, $span$ to it, and no good $span$ when you are there: They $span$ as they tell us, to build a $span$ to entertain Per&s;ons of $word$ $r &s;uch who would &s;pend their $word$ $word$ it: but it was not &s;o far $word$ $r directed when I was there, $span$ any where begun: The Bath $word$ or rather Blood warm, very $word$ to go into, and very Senative, e&s;|c$ally for Rh$umatick Pains, Brui&s;es, $word$.</P>
<P>$word$ &s;ome Miles before we come to $word$ you pa&s;s over the Hills by the $word$ mouths of the Lead Mines, and $re are Melting Hou&s;es for the pre|$$ing the Oar, and melting or ca&s;ting $word$ $$gs; and &s;o they carry it to $word$ worth to be &s;old at the Market $word$ a$ai$&s;t this warm Bath, and on $word$ other, or Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Derwent, $word$ a high Rock, which ri&s;es from $word$ very bottom of the River (for the $word$ wa&s;hes the Foot of it, and is there $d$y weather very &s;hallow); I &s;ay, it $word$ perpendicular as a wall, the $word$ $word$ $nd &s;mooth like one plain Stone, &s;uch a prodigious heighth, it is really $ri&s;ing; yet what the People believed $t &s;urmounted all my Faith too, though $$ked upon it very curiou&s;ly, for they $word$ me it was above four hundred Foot $word$ which is as high as two of our Monuments, one &s;et upon another; that which adds mo&s;t to my wonder in it is, that as the &s;tone &s;tands, it is &s;mooth from the very bottom of the Derwent to the uppermo&s;t Point, and nothing can be &s;een to grow upon it. The prodigi|ous heighth of this Tor, (for it is called Matlock Tor) was to me more a won|der than any of the re&s;t in the Peak, and, I think&punc; it &s;hould be named among them, but it is not So it mu&s;t not be called one o$ th$ wonders.</P>
<P>A little on the other &s;ide of Wirk&s;|worth, begins a long Plain called Bra&s;|&s;ington Mo$r, which reaches full twelve miles in length another way, viz. from Bra&s;&s;ington to Buxton. At the beginning of it on this &s;ide from Wirk&s;worth, it is not quite &s;o much. The Peak Peo|ple, who are mighty fond of having Stran|gers &s;hewed every Thing they can, and of calling every thing a wonder, told us here of another high mountain, where a Grant was buried, and which they called the Giant's Tomb.</P>
<P>This tempted our Curio&s;ity, and we pre&s;ently rod up to the mountain in or|der to leave our Hor&s;$s. Dragoon li$e, with a Servant, and to clamber up to the Top of it, to &s;ee this Giant's Tomb: Here we mi&s;s'd the imaginary wonder, and found a real one; the &s;tory of which I cannot but record, to &s;hew the di&s;con|tented Part of the rich World how to value their own Happine&s;s, by looking below them, and &s;eeing how others live, who yet are capable of being ea&s;ie and content, which content goes a great way towards being happy, if it does not come quite up to Happine&s;s. The &s;tory is this:</P>
<P>As we came near the Hill, which &s;eem|ed to be round, and a Precipice almo&s;t on every Side, we perceived a little parcel of Ground hedg'd in, as if it were a Garden, it was about twenty or thirty Yards lorg, but not &s;o much broad. Parallel with the Hill, and clo&s;e to it; we &s;aw no Hou&s;e, but, by a Dog running out barking, we perceived &s;ome People were thereabout;
<PB REF="358">
and pre&s;ently after we &s;aw two little Children, and then a third run out to &s;ee what was the Matter. When we came clo&s;e up we &s;aw a &s;mall opening, not a Door, but a natural opening into the Rock, and the Noi&s;e we had made brought a Woman out with a Child in her Arms, and another at her Foot. N. B. The big|ge&s;t of the&s;e five was a Girl, about eight or ten Years old.</P>
<P>We asked the Woman &s;ome Que&s;tions about the Tomb of the Giant upon the Rock or Mountain, She told us, there was a broad flat Stone of a great &s;ize lay there, which, &s;he &s;aid, the People call'd a Grave&s;tone; and, if it was, it might well be called a Giant's, for &s;he thought no ordinary Man was ever &s;o tall, and &s;he de&s;crib'd it to us as well as &s;he could, by which it mu&s;t be at lea&s;t &s;ixteen or &s;even|teen Foot long; but &s;he could not give any farther Account of it, neither did &s;he &s;eem to lay any Stre&s;s upon the Tale of a Giant being buried there, but &s;aid, if her Husband had been at home he might have &s;hown it to us. I &s;natch'd at the Word, at home! &s;ays I, good Wife, why, where do you live. Here, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, and points to the Hole in the Rock. Here! &s;ays I; and do all the&s;e Children live here too? Yes, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, they were all born here. Pray how long have you dwelt here then? &s;aid I. My Husband was born here, &s;aid &s;he, and his Father before him. Will you give me leave, &s;ays one of our Company, as cu|rious as I was, to come in and &s;ee your Hou&s;e, Dame? If you plea&s;e, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, but 'tis not a Place &s;it for &s;uch as you are to come into, calling him, your Wor|&s;hip, for&s;ooth; but that by the by. I mention it, to &s;hew that the good Woman did not want Manners, though &s;he liv'd in a Den like a wild Body.</P>
<P>However, we alighted and went in: There was a large hallow Cave, which the poor People by two Curtains hang'd cro&s;s, had parted into three Room. On one Side was the Chimney, and the Man, or perhaps his Father, being Miners, had found means to work a Shaft or Funnel through the Rock to carry the Smoke $word$ at the Top, where the Giant's $span$ was. The Habitation was poor, 'tis true, but Things within did not look $o like Mi&s;ery as I expected. Every T ing was clean and neat, tho' mean and $word$ There were Shelves with $arth$n $word$ and &s;ome Pewter and Bra&s;s. There was, which I ob&s;erved in particular, a $word$ Flitch or Side of Bacon hanging up $word$ Chimney, and by it a good Piece o$ $word$ There was a Sow and Pigs $word$ about at the Door, and a little $word$ $word$ feeding upon a green Place ju&s;t $word$ Door, and the little enclo&s;ed $word$ $word$ Ground I mentioned, was growing $word$ good Barley; it being then near $word$</P>
<P>To find out whence this appearance $word$ Sub&s;tance came, I asked the poor Wom$$ what Trade her Husband was? She $word$ he worked in the Lead Mi$es. I asked her, how much he could earn a Day there? &s;he &s;aid, if he had good $word$ could earn about five pe$ce a Day $word$ that he worked by the Di&s;h (wh$$$ was a Term of Art I did not under&s;tand, $word$ &s;uppo&s;ed, as I afterwards under&s;tood $word$ was, by the Great, in portion to the Or, which they mea&s;ure in a wooden $word$ which they call a Di&s;h.) I then a $word$ what &s;he did?

<P>This moving Sight &s;o affected us all, that, upon a &s;hort Conference at the Door, we made up a little Lump of Money, and I had the honour to be Almoner for the Company; and though the Sum was $o$ great, being at mo&s;t &s;omething $word$ Crown, as I told it into the poor Woman's Hand, I could perceive &s;uch a S$$prize in her Face, that, had &s;he not $span$ to her Joy by a &s;udden flux of Years, I found &s;he would have fainted $word$ She was &s;ome time before &s;he $word$ do any thing but Cry, but after that was abated, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her &s;elf ve|ry hand&s;omely (for a poor Body) and t ld me, &s;he had not &s;een &s;o much Money t$ gether of her own for many Months.</P>

<P>$rom hence enquiring no farther after $e G ant, or his Tomb, we went, by $e due $ion of the poor woman, to a $$ley on the &s;ide of a ri&s;ing Hill, where $e$e were &s;everal Grooves, &s;o they call $e mouth of the &s;haft or pit by which $ey go down into a Lead Mine; and $word$ we were &s;tanding &s;till to look at one $word$ them&punc; admiring how &s;mall they were $word$ $earce believing a poor Man that $word$ it us, when he told us, that they went wn tho&s;e narrow Pits or Holes to &s;o great a Depth in the Earth; I &s;ay, while we were wondering, and &s;carce believing the Fact, we were agreeably &s;urprized with &s;eeing a Hand, and then an Arm, and quickly after a Head, thru&s;t up out of the very Groove we were looking at.

<P>Immediately we rode clo&s;er up to the Place, where we &s;ee $he poor Wretch working and heaving him&s;elf up gradual|ly, as we thought, with difficuly; but when he &s;hewed us that it was by &s;et|ting his Feet upon Pleces of Wood &s;ixt cro&s;s the Angles of the Groove like a Ladder, we found that the Difficulty was not much; and if the Groove had been larger they could not either go up or down &s;o ea&s;ily, or with &s;o much &s;afety, for that now their Elbows re&s;ting on tho&s;e Pieces as well as their Feet, they went up and down with great Ea&s;e and Safety.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who would have a more perfect Idea of tho&s;e Grooves, need do no more than go to the Church of St. Paul's, and de&s;ire to &s;ee the &s;quare Wells which they have there to go down from the Top of the Church into the very Vaults under it, to place the Leaden Pipes which car|ry the Rain Water from the flat of the Roof to the Common &s;hore, which Wells are &s;quare, and have &s;mall Iron Bats placed cro&s;s the Angles for the Workmen to &s;et their Feet on, to go up and down to repair the Pipes.</P>
<P>When this &s;ubterranean Creature was come out, with all his Furniture about him, we had as much Variety to take us up as before, and our Curio&s;ity received full Satisfaction without venturing down, as we were per&s;uaded to by &s;ome People, and as two of our Company were in|clined to do.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t&punc; the Man was a mo&s;t uncouth &s;$ ct$$le, he was cloathed all in Lea|ther had a Cap of the &s;ame without $word$ &s;ome Tools in a little Bas&s;ket which he drew up with him, not one of the
<PB REF="360">
Names of which we could under&s;tand but by the help of an Interpreter. Nor indeed could we under&s;tand any of the Man's Di&s;cour&s;e &s;o as to make outth whole Sentence; and yet the Man was pretty free of his Tongue.</P>
<P>For his Per&s;on, he was lean as a &s;kele|ton, pale as dead corps, his hair and beard a deep black, his fle&s;h lank, and, as we thought, &s;omething of the Co|lour of the Lead it&s;elf, and being very tall and very lean he look'd, or we that &s;aw him a&s;cend <HI>ab Inferis,</HI> fancied he look'd like an Inhabitant of the dark Regions below, and who was ju&s;t a&s;cend|ed into the world of Light.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides his Ba&s;ket of Tools, he brought up with him about three quarters of a hundred weight of Oar, which we won|dered at, for the Man had no &s;mall Load to bring, con&s;idering the manner of his coming up; and this indeed made him come heaving and &s;truggling up, as I &s;aid at fir&s;t, as if he had great Difficulty to get out; whereas it was indeed the weight that he brought with him.</P>
<P>If any Reader thinks this, and the pa&s;t relation of the Woman and the Cave, too low and trifling &s;o this work, they mu&s;t be told, that I think quite other|wi&s;e; aud e&s;pecially con&s;idering what a Noi&s;e is made of Wonders in this coun|try, which, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, have no|thing in them curious, but much talked of, more trifling a great deal. See <HI>Cot|ton</HI>'s <HI>Wonders of the Peak, Hobbes</HI>'s <HI>Chat&s;worth,</HI> and &s;everal others; but I &s;hall make no more Apologies. I return to our &s;ubterranean Apparition.</P>
<P>We a&s;ked him, how deep the Mine lay which he came out of: He an&s;wered us in Terms as we did not under&s;tand; but our Interpreter, as above, told us, it &s;ignified that he was at work 60 Fa|thoms deep, but that there were five men of his Party, who were, two of them, eleven Fathoms, and the other three fifteen Fathoms deeper: He &s;eem|ed to regret that he was not at work with tho&s;e three; for that they had a deeper Vein of Oar than that which he worked in, and had a way out at the &s;ide of the Hill, where they pa&s;s'd with|out coming up &s;o high as he was oblig'd to do.</P>
<P>If we ble&s;&s;ed out &s;elves before, $word$ we &s;aw how the poor Woman and $word$ five Children lived in the Hole $r $word$ in the mountain, with the Giant's $word$ over their Heads; we had much $word$ room to reflect how much we $word$ acknowledge to our Maker, $span$ were not appointed to get $span$ thus, one hundred and fifty $span$ Ground&punc; or in a Hole as d$$p $word$ Earth as the Cro&s;s upon St. $span$ polo is high out of it: Nor was $span$ to &s;ee the&s;e mi&s;erable People $word$ &s;uch Reflections, unle&s;s $span$ &s;uppo&s;e a Man as &s;tupid and $word$ the Hor&s;e he Rides on. But to $word$ Moralizing to the Reader, I $word$</P>
<P>We then look'd on the Oar, $span$ the poor Man's leave to bring $span$ a &s;mall Piece of it away with us, fo$ $word$ we gave him two &s;mall Pieces $span$ Mettle, called Shillings, which made $word$ Heart glad; and, as we under&s;tood $word$ our Interpreter, was more than he $word$ gain at &s;ixty Fathoms under Ground $word$ three Days; and we found &s;oon $word$ the money was &s;o much, that it $word$ him move off immediately towards $word$ Alehou&s;e, to melt &s;ome of it in$o $word$ Pale Derby; but, to his farther $word$ Luck, we were gotten to the &s;ame $word$ hou&s;e before him; where when we $word$ him c$me, we gave him &s;ome $word$ too&punc; and made him keep his $word$ and promi&s;e us to carry it home to $word$ Family, which they told $word$ lived $word$ by.</P>
<P>From hence entring upon $span$ Moor, mentioned above&punc; we $span$ miles &s;mooth Green rid$$g to $word$ Bath, which they call one of the W$$|ders of the Peak; but is &s;o far fro$ being a Wonder, that to us, who ha$ been at Bath in Somer&s;et&s;hire, and $word$ Aix la Chapelle in Germany, it was no|thing
<PB REF="361">
at all; nor is it any thing but what is frequent in &s;uch monntainous Coun|tries as this is, in many Parts of the World.</P>
<P>That which was more wonderful to me than all of it, was, that &s;o light is made of them as to U&s;e; that the Peo|ple rather wonder at them than take the Benefit of them; and that, as there are &s;everal hot Springs in this Village of Bux|$on, as well as Matlock, mentioned a|bove, and at &s;everal other Places, they are not bu$lt into noble and convenient $athing Places; and, in&s;tead of a Hou&s;e $span$ a City built here for the $word$ $word$ of Company; which, if it $span$ and Cou$$na$$e given to $span$ to the Baths at Bath, I doubt not $word$ be as well frequented, and to as $ed Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But though I &s;hall not treat this warm $span$ Wonder, for &s;uch it is not; $span$ give it the Prai&s;e $word$ to the $word$ Virtue of its $word$ it is not to be deny'd, but that $word$ Cures have been wrought by $word$ e&s;pecially in Rhematick, Scorbu|$ and &s;cropulous Di&s;tempers, Aches of $ Joints, nervous Pains, and al&s;o in $ly and lepoous Maladies.</P>
<P>For a Proof of this, and to give a Reputation to the Waters of Bux|$$ I $$ave leave to give a brief Ac|$$nt of wh t the Learned &s;ay of their $word$ and the manner of their Ope|$n; and though I &s;hall not crowd this $word$ with any thing from Books, which $word$ more than common, and more than $word$ u&s;eful, yet I mu&s;t be exculed $word$ as what I think excels in both: from the learned Dr. Leigh in his $word$ Hi&s;tory of Lanca&s;hire, and of the $word$ his words are as follows:</P>
<P>A$$$meaning at Buxton, the $word$ and Saline, yet not th$ry Fo$t $$88. $word$ br$$d at $$ <HI>foetid,</HI> but very palatable, becau&s;e the Sulphur is not united with any Vitrio|lic Particles, or but very few Saline; it tinges not Silver, nor is it Purgative, becau&s;e its Saline Parts are di$$en&s;ed in &s;uch &s;mall Proportions, which Saline Particles make up a compound Salt, con&s;tituted of a $word$ Salt, and the <HI>$span$</HI> wh$$h indeed is the <HI>$span$</HI> th t $word$ $g|nates Ep$$$n, Northall and Dullwich Wa|ters, and others in tho&s;e Parts, as at Stretham, Peokham, Shooters Hill, &amp;c. in the County of Kent</P>
<P>The&s;e Waters (Buxton) if drank, create a good Appotre, open Ob&s;tructi|ons, and no doubt, if mixed with the Chylybeat Waters that are there al&s;o, may an&s;wer all the intentions of the Bath Water in Some$$$t&s;hire, and that of Sir Vincent's too at Bri&s;tol, &s;o noted for curing the <HI>Diabetes;</HI> of which I have &s;everal In&s;tances in the&s;e Parts; and likewi&s;e for curing of Bloody Urines, of which I &s;aw a mo&s;t noted In&s;tance at Li|verpool.</P>
<P>This Bath is of a temperate Heat, and without que&s;tion, by a reverberat|ing <HI>Halitus</HI> might be brought to any Degree of Heat; but, I think, in its own natural Heat, it may in general be &s;aid to be more agreeable to the Con&s;titu|tions of tho&s;e Parts; and where the hot Baths cannot be &s;afely u&s;ed, this may This la&s;t Summer I &s;aw remarkable In|&s;tances of its Effects in &s;corbutick Rheu|ma$$ms in Per&s;ons, that could not go before without the help of Crutches, who came from thence to Manche&s;ter on foot without them, di&s;tant from Buxton full &s;ixteen Northern Miles.</P>
<P>For the Antiquiry of the&s;e Baths too, though there is not a King Bladud to te&s;lity for them, as a Bath in Somer|$$$&s;hire, who&s;e Evidence we cannot be be &s;ure is very ju&s;ti&s;iable, yet hear the &s;ame Author on that Article:</P>
<P><PB REF="362">
That the&s;e Baths were eminent in the Romans time, is mo&s;t certain. Lucan, and others acquaint us, they were extra|ordinary hot, the High Road, called the Roman Bath Gate, as Mr. Cambden &s;ays, further confirms it; but it is e&s;pecially evident from a Roman Wall cemeuted with red Roman Plai&s;ter, clo&s;e by St. Anne's Well, where we may &s;ee the ruins of the antient Bath, its Dimen&s;ions and Length.</P>
<P>The Waters are temperately hot, or ra|ther warm, and operate rather as a cold Bath, without that violent Attack which the cold Bath makes upon all Nature at once: you feel a little Chilne&s;s when you fir&s;t dip or plunge into the Water, but it is gone in a Moment; and you find a kind of an equality in the warmth of your Blood and that of the Water, and that &s;o very plea&s;ant, that far from the $word$ and weakening Violence of the hot Baths, which makes you ready to die away if you continue above an Hour, or thereabouts, in them, and will &s;hrivel up the Fingers like tho&s;e of Women, who have been wa&s;hing Cloaths; on the con|trary, here you are never tired, and can hardly be per&s;uaded to come out of the Bath when you are in.</P>
<P>The Village where the principal Springs are, is called Buxton; though there are &s;everal of them, for they ri&s;e unregarded in the Banks of the Enclo&s;ures, and on the Sides of the Hill, &s;o that the Num|ber is hardly known; there is but one Bath which is walled in with Stone Walls, and Steps made to go down into it, and a Hou&s;e built over it, though not &s;o clo&s;e as is fit for Winter bathing.</P>
<P>The Duke of Devon&s;hire is Lord of the Village, and con&s;equently of the Bath it&s;elf; and his Grace has built a large hand&s;ome Hou&s;e at the Bath, where there is convenient Lodging, and very good Provi&s;ions, and an Ordinary well &s;erved for One Shilling per Head$&punc; but it is but one. And though &s;ome other Hou&s;es in the Town take in Lodgers upon occa&s;ion, yet the Conveniencies are not the &s;ame; &s;o that there is not Accommodation for a Confluence of People, as at the Bath. Hou&s;e it &s;elf: If it were otherwi&s;e, and that the Nobility and Gentry were $word$ entertained, I doubt not but $word$ would be frequented, and with more e|fect as to the Health, as well as much more Satisfaction to the Company, where thete is an open and healthy Country, a great variety of View to $a$$sty the $$|rious, and a fine Down or Moor for $word$ Ladies to take a Ring upon in $word$ Coaches, all much more convenient $word$ in a clo&s;e City as the Bath is, $word$ more like a Pri&s;on than a Place of D$|ver&s;ion, &s;carce gives the Company room to conver&s;e out of the &s;mell of th$$$ own Excrements, and where the very City at &s;elf may be &s;aid to think like a ge$$$al Common &s;hore.</P>
<P>We &s;aw indeed a Variety of Objects here; &s;ome that came purely for the Plea&s;ure of Bathing, taking the Air, and to &s;ee the Country, which has many Things rare and valuable to be &s;een, tho' nothing, as I met with, can be ca$|led a Wonder, Elden Hole excepted, of which in its Place: We found others that came purely for Cure, as the lame Man to the Pool; of which &s;ome openly ap|plauded the Virtue of the Bath, as evi|dently working a Cure upon them One Object indeed, who, whether his Phy&s;i|cian mi&s;took his Di&s;ea&s;e, or he gave $word$ Phy&s;ician a wrong Account, (as is $word$ probable) was very inadvertendly $word$ thither, &s;ound him&s;elf fatally $word$ the Bath: What the Rea&s;on of $word$ might be, I leave to the I earned&punc; $word$ upon this occa&s;ion, one of our Company left the following Lines written on $word$ Wall in the Bathing Hou&s;e:</P>
<LG>

May thy cha&s;t Streams quench no di&s;hone&s;t Flame,</L>
<L>But as thy Fountain's pure, be pure thy Fame.</L>
</LG>
<P>South We&s;t from hence, about a quar|ter of a Mile, or not &s;o much on the Side, or rather at the Foot of a very high Ridge of Mountains, is a great Cave or Hole in the Earth, called Poole's Hole, another of the Wonderle&s;s Wonders of the Peak. The Wit that has been &s;pent upon this Vault or Cave in the Earth, had been well enough to rai&s;e the expectation of Strangers, and bring Fools a great way to creep into it; but is ill be&s;towed upon $word$ tho&s;e that come to the Place with a $word$ Curio&s;ity, founded upon antient Re|$$rt; when the&s;e go in to &s;ee it, they ge|nerally go away, acknowledging that they have &s;een nothing &s;uitable to their great Expectation, or to the Fame of the P$ace.</P>
<P>It is a great Cave&punc; or natural Vault, an$ient doubtle&s;s as the Mountain it&s;elf, and occa&s;ioned by the fortuitous Po&s;ition of the Rocks at the creation of all Things, or perhaps at the great Ab&s;orpti|on or Influx of the Surface into the Aby&s;s at the great Rupture of the Earth's Cru&s;t or Shell, according to Mr. Burnet's The|ory, and to me it &s;eems a Confirmation of that Hypothe&s;es of the breaking in of the Surface. But that by the way:</P>
<P>It may be deepen'd and enlarged by Streams and Eruptions of &s;ubterraneous Waters, of which here are &s;everal, as $word$ generally are in all &s;uch Cavities; as at Ca&s;tleton in this Country, at Wooky $word$ in Somer&s;et&s;hire, which I have al|ready &s;poken of; and at &s;everal like Caves which are now to be &s;een among the Mountains in Swi&s;&s;erland, in Norway, $word$ Hungary, and other Places.</P>
<P>The Story of one Pole or Poole a $word$ Giant or Robber, (they might as $span$ have called him a Man Eater) who $span$ in this Vault, and who&s;e $span$ or Bed-Chamber, they $span$ Right-hand, after you have crept about ten Yards upon All-Fours; I &s;ay, this I leave to tho&s;e who &s;uch Stories are better &s;uited to, than I expect of my Readers.</P>
<P>However, this helps among the People there, to make out the Wonder; and in|deed &s;uch Things are wanting where real|ly Wonder is wanting, el$e there would be no Wonder at all in it; as indeed there is not</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t you meet with after this, is the extraordinary heighth of the Arch or Roof; however, is far from what a late flaming Author has magnified it to, (viz) a quarter of a Mile perpendicular. That it is very high, is enough to &s;ay; for it is &s;o far from a quarter of a Mile, that there &s;eems nothing admirable in it.</P>
<P>Dr. Leigh &s;pends &s;ome time in admir|ing the &s;pangled Roof. Cotton and Hob|bes are mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly and outrageou&s;ly witty upon it. Dr. Leigh calls it Fret Work, Organ, and Choir Work. The whole of the Matter is this, that the Rock being every where moi&s;t and drop|ping, the Drops are &s;ome fallen, tho&s;e you &s;ee below; &s;ome falling, tho&s;e you have glancing by you En pa&s;&s;ant; and others pendant in the Roof. Now as you have Guides before you and behind you, carrying every one a Candle, the light of the Candles reflected by the globular drops of Water, dazle upon your Eyes from every Corner; like as the drops of Dew in a &s;unny bright Morning reflect the ri&s;ing Light to the Eye, and are as ten thou&s;and Rainbows in miniature; where|as were any Part of the Roof or Arch of this Vault to be &s;een by a clear Light, there would be no more Beauty on it than on the Back of a Chimney; for, in &s;hort, the Stone is cour&s;e, &s;$imy, with the con|&s;tant wet, dirty and dull; and were the little drops of Water gone, or the Can|dles gone, there would be none of the&s;e &s;ine Sights to be &s;een for Wonders&punc; or for the learned Authors above to &s;how them&s;elves fooli&s;h about.</P>
<P>Let any Per&s;on therefore, who goes into Poole's Hole for the future, and has
<PB REF="364">
a mind to try the Experiment, take a long Pole in his Hand, with a Cloth tied to the end of it, and mark any Place of the &s;hining &s;pangled Roof which his Pole will reach to; and then, wip|ing the drops of Water away, he &s;hall &s;ee he will at once extingui&s;h all tho&s;e Glories; then let him &s;it &s;till and wait a little, till, by the Nature of the Thing, the Drops &s;weil out again, and he &s;hall find the Stars and Spangles ri&s;e again, by Degrees here one, and there one, till they &s;hine with the &s;ame Fraud, a meer <HI>deceptio vi&s;us,</HI> as they did before. As for the Queen of Scots Pillar, as 'tis cal'ed, becau&s;e her late unfortunate Maje&s;ty, Mary Queen of Scots, was plea&s;ed to have it be called &s;o, it is a Piece of Stone like a kind of Spar, which is found about the Lead; and 'tis not improbable in a Country where there is &s;o much of the Oar, it may be of the &s;ame kind, and, &s;tanding upright, obtained the Name of a Pillar; of which almo&s;t every Body that comes there, carries away a Piece, in Veneration of the Memory of the unhappy Prince&s;s that gave it her Name. Nor is there any thing &s;trange or unu&s;ual in the S$one, much le&s;s in the Figure of it, which is otherwi&s;e very mean, and in that Country very common.</P>
<P>As to the &s;everal Stones called Mr. Cotton's Haycock's, Poole's Chair, Flitch|es of Bacon, and the like, they are no|thing but ordinary Stones; and the Shape very little re&s;emble the Things they are &s;aid to repre&s;ent; but the fruitful Imagination of the Country Carls, who fancy to call them &s;o, will have them to look like them; a Stranger &s;ees very little even of the Similitude, any more than when People fancy they &s;ee Faces and Heads, Ca&s;tles and Cities, Armies, Hor&s;es and Men, in the Clouds, in the Fire&punc; and the like.</P>
<P>Nor is the petrifying of the Water, which appears in its pendant form like Iceles in the Roof aloft, or ri&s;ing Pyra|mids below, if &s;uch there were, any thing but what is frequent and natural both to Water and to Stone, placed $word$ and Ground, and &s;eems to be the way by which even Stone it&s;elf, like other Vegetables fructifies and grows.</P>
<P>So that, in &s;hort, there is nothing in Poole's Hole to make a Wonder of, a$y more than as other Things in Nature, which are rare to be &s;een, however $$|&s;ily accounted for, may be called won|derful.</P>
<P>Having thus accounted for two of the &s;even Things, called Wonders in thi$ Country, I pa&s;s by Elden Hole&punc; which I &s;hall take notice of by it &s;elf, and come to two more of them, as wo$de$$e$$, and empty of every Thing that may be called rare of &s;trange, as the other; and indeed much more &s;o.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is Mam $word$ as the Word in the Mountain Jargon, &s;ig|nifies, the Mother Rock, upon a Sug|ge&s;tion that the &s;oft crumbling Earth, which falls from the Summit of the one, breeds or begets &s;everal Mountains be|low. The Sum of the whole Wonder is this, That there is a very high Hill, nay, I will add (that I may make the mo&s;t of the Story, and that it may ap|pear as much like a Wonder as I can) an exceeding high Hill. But this in a Country which is all over Hills, can|not be much of a Wonder becau&s;e al|&s;o there are &s;everal higher Hills in the Peak than that, only not ju&s;t the$e.</P>
<P>The South Side of this Hill is a Pre|cipice, and very &s;teep from the Top to the Bottom; and as the $word$ this Hill is not a &s;olid S$o$e, o$ $word$ as is the Ca&s;e of all the Hills therea|bouts, but a cr$mbling loo&s;e $word$ $$$|gled with &s;mall Stones, i$ $span$ falling down in &s;mall $word$ as the force of ha&s;ty Shower, or $$lid hea|vy Rains, loo&s;en&punc; and wa&s;hes it off, or as Fro&s;ts and Thaws operate upon it in common with other Parts of the Earth&punc; now as the great Hill, which is $word$ as well as high, parts with $span$ Stuff, without being $span$
<PB REF="365">
yet the bottom which it falls into, is more ea&s;ily perceived to &s;well with the Quantity that falls down; the &s;pace where it is received being &s;mall, comparatively to the heighth and thickne&s;s of the moun|tain: Here the pretended Wonder is form'd, namely, that the little Heap be|low, &s;hould grow up into a Hill, and yet the great Hill not be the le&s;s for all that is fallen down; which is not true in fact, any more than, as a great black Cloud pouring down Rain as it pa&s;&s;es over our Heads, appears &s;till as great and as black as before, though it continues pouring down Rain over all the Country. But nothing is more certain than this, that the more Water comes down from it, the le&s;s remains in it; and &s;o it certainly is of Mam Tor, in &s;pite of all the Po|etry of Mr. Cotton or Mr. Hobbes, and in &s;pight of all the Women's Tales in the Peak.</P>
<P>This Hill lies on the North &s;ide of the Road from Buxton to Ca&s;tleton, where we come to the &s;o famed Wonder call'd, &s;aving our good Manners, <HI>The Devil's A&mdash;e in the Peak:</HI> Now notwith|&s;tanding the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Name gi|ven it, and that there is nothing of &s;i|militude coherence either in Form and Figure, or any other thing &s;ignified and the thing &s;ignifying; yet we mu&s;t &s;earch narrowly for any thing in it to make a Wonder, or even any thing &s;o &s;trange&punc; or $word$ or vulgar, as the Name would &s;eem to import.</P>
<P>The &s;hort of this Story is; that on the &s;teep &s;ide of a Mountain; there is a large opening very high, broad at bot|tom, and narrow, but rounding, on the top, almo&s;t the Form of the old Gothick Gates or Archs, which come up, not to a half Circle or half Oval at the top, but to a $oint; though this being all wild and irregular, cannot be &s;aid to be an Arch, but a meer Cha&s;me, entring ho|rizontally; the opening being upwards of thirty Fo$t perpendicular, and twice as m$$h broad at the bottom at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Arch continues thus wide but a little way; yet far enough to have &s;eve|veral &s;mall Cottages built on either &s;ide of it within the Entrance; &s;o that 'tis like a little Town in a Vault: In the middle, &punc;as it were a Street) is a run|ning &s;tream of Water; the poetical De|&s;criptions of it will have this be called a River, tho' they have not yet be&s;tow'd a Name upon it, nor indeed is it worthy a Name.</P>
<P>As you go on, the Roof de&s;cends gradually, and is &s;o far from admitting Hou&s;es to &s;tand in it, that you have not leave to &s;tand upright your &s;elf, till &s;toop|ing for a little way, and pa&s;&s;ing over another Rill of Water, which Mr. Cot|ton calls a River, you find more Room over your Head. But going a little far|ther you come to a third Water, which cro&s;&s;es your way; and the Rock &s;toop|ing, as it were, down almo&s;t to the &s;urface of the Water, forbids any farther Enquiry into what is beyond.</P>
<P>This is the whole Wonder, unle&s;s it may be called &s;o, that our Ance&s;tors &s;hould give it &s;o homely a Sirname; and give us no Rea&s;on for it, but what we mu&s;t gue&s;s at from the uncouth entrance of the Place, which being no guide in the Ca&s;e, leave us to reflect a little upon their Mode&s;ty of Expre&s;&s;ion; but it &s;eems they talked broader in tho&s;e Days than we do now.</P>
<P>To conclude: If there were no &s;uch Vaults and Arches any where but in the Peak, or indeed if they were not frequent in &s;uch mountainous Countries, as well here, as in othe' other Nations we might call this a Wonder. But as we know they are to be found in many Places of England, and that we read of them in the De&s;cription of other Countries, and even in the Scripture, we cannot think there is any room to call it a Wonder. We read of the Cave of Adullam, and of the Cave of Mackp$lah, in the Scrip|ture, able to receive David, and his whole Troop of four hundred Men. We read
<PB REF="366">
of the per&s;ecuted Worthies in the 12th of the Hebrews, who wandered about in Dens and Caves of the Earth. We read of a Cave in the Apenine Mountains near to Florence, which was able to re|ceive an Army; there are al&s;o many &s;uch Caves, as I have ob&s;erved above, in the Alpes, and the Hills of Dauphine and Sa|voy, and in other Parts of the World, too many to run over; and &s;ome of them, &s;uch as this is not worthy to be named among them.</P>
<P>Indeed, had Gervai&s;e of Tilbury been credited, this Place had de&s;erved all that Wonder cou'd a&s;cribe to it; for he tells us of $ Shepherd who, having ventured into the third River in this Den, and be|ing either carried over it or down the Stream, he knew not whether, &s;aw a beautiful heavenly Country beyond it, with a &s;pacious Plain watered with many clear Rivers and plea&s;ant Brooks, and &s;e+veral Lakes of &s;tanding Water. But who this Shepherd was, how he got into that plea&s;ant Country, and, above all, how he came back to tell the Story our Friend Gervai&s;e forgot, it &s;eems, to take any notice of; and &s;o the Tale is broken off before it was half told&punc; like another of the &s;ame kind which Hudibras tells of,
<Q><L>Which, like the Tale o'th' Bear and Fid|dle,</L>
<L>Was told; but broke off in the middle.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next Wonder, which makes up Number five, is called Tide&s;well, or a Spring of Water which ebbs and flows, as they will have it, as the Sea does. A poor thing indeed to make a Wonder of; and therefore mo&s;t of the Writers pa&s;s it over with little notice; only that they are at a lo&s;s to make up the Number &s;even without it.</P>
<P>This Well or Spring is called Weeden Well; the Ba&s;in or Receiver for the Wa|ter is about three Foot qu&s;are every way; the Water &s;eems to have &s;ome other Re|ceiver within the Rock, which, when it $ills by the force of the original Stream, which is &s;mall, the Air being contracted or pent in, forces the Water out with a bubbling Noi&s;e, and &s;o fills the Receiver without; but when the Force is &s;pent within, then it &s;tops till the Place is fil|led again; and, in the mean time, the Water without runs off or ebbs, till the Quantity within &s;wells again, and then the &s;ame Cau&s;es produce the &s;ame Effects, as will always be while the World en|dures. So that all this Wonder is $word$ only to the Situation of the Place, which is a meer Accident in Nature; and $word$ any Per&s;on were to dig into the Place, and give vent to the Air, which fills the con|tracted Space within, they would &s;oon &s;ee Tide&s;well turned into an ordinary running Stream, and a very little on too.</P>
<P>So much for fictitious Wonders, or in|deed &s;imple Wonders. The two real Wonders which remain, are fir&s;t, Elden Hole, and &s;econdly, the Duke of Devon|&s;hire's fine Hou&s;e at Chat&s;worth; one a Wonder of Nature, the other of Art. I begin with the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Chat&s;worth is indeed a mo&s;t glorious and magnificent Hou&s;e, and, as it has had two or three Founders, may well be &s;aid to be compl$atly de&s;igned and fini&s;h|ed. It was begun on a much narrower Plan than it now takes up, by Sir Wil|liam Cavendi&s;h, of Cavendi&s;h in Suffolk, who married the Counte&s;s Dowager $word$ Shrewsbury, and with her came into $ noble and plentiful Fortune in this Coun|try.</P>
<P>Sir William died, having done little more than built one end of the $word$ and laid out the Plan, as I have $word$ $word$ Ichnography of the whole. But the La|dy, who, it &s;eems, was the mover of the fir&s;t De&s;ign, fini&s;h'd $word$ whole in the magnificent Manner which it appeared i$, when it was fir&s;t chri&s;ten&punc;d a Wonder, and ranked among the Marvellous of the Peak. But what would the World have called it, or what would Mr. Cambden have &s;aid of it&punc; had it appeared in tho&s;e Days in the Glory and Splendor its la&s;t great Founder, for &s;o we may ju&s;tly call him, l$ft it in.</P>
<P><PB REF="367">
It is indeed a Palace for a Prince, a mo&s;t magnificent Building, and, in &s;pite of all the Difficulties or Di&s;advantages of Situation, is a perfect Beauty; nay, the very Ob&s;tructions and, as I called them, Di&s;advantages of its Situation, &s;erve to &s;et off its Beauty, and are, by the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Decoration of the Place, made to add to the Lu&s;tre of the whole. But it would take up a Volume by it&s;elf to de&s;cribe it. I &s;hall only touch at tho&s;e Things which other Writers have omit+ted; for as Mr. Hobbes has elegantly $$t it off in Latin Ver&s;e, Mr. Cotton, after h$s manner, in Engli&s;h, $$d $$hers, in as good a manner as they can, in Hi&s;tory; t$ey have yet, all of them, l$ft enough $word$ me to $ay, and $o &s;$$ll I, for many $word$ me; and y$t perhaps it &s;hall be as $word$ Ye$$$ $word$ as it was in $word$ and the $word$ be n$ more fini&s;h|e$ than the Build ng, which $ill have al|ways an encrea&s;e of Ornament, $word$ the $word$ Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;ee room to add to its Glory.</P>
<P>The Front to the Garden is the mo&s;t regul$r Piece of Architect I have &s;een in all the North Part of England; the Pila&s;ter &s;e enty two Foot high to the foot of the $word$ after on the top; the F$ize under the $word$ is &s;pacious, and has the Motto of the Family upon it, the Letters &s;o large (and gilded) as takes up the whole Front, tho' the Words are but the&s;e two:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>CAVENDO T&V;T&V;S.</HEAD>
<P>The Sa&s;hes of the &s;econd Story we $ere told are &s;eventeen Foot high, the Plates poli&s;h'd Looking Gla&s;s, and the Wood work double gilded; which, I think, $s $o where el&s;e to be &s;een in England.</P>
<P>Under this Front lye the Gardens ex|$u$&s;itely &s;ine; and to make a clear Vi&s;ta $r Pro&s;pect beyond into the flat Country, $owards Hardwick, another Seat of the $ame owner, the Duke, to whom what $thers thought impo&s;&s;ible, was not only made practicable, but ea&s;y, removed, and $erfectly carried away a great Mountain $hat &s;tood in the way, and which inter|$$pted the Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>This was &s;o entirely gone, that, ha|ving taken a &s;trict View of the Gardens at my fir&s;t being there, and retaining an Idea of them in my Mind, I was perfect|ly confounded at coming there a &s;econd time, and not knowing what had been done; for I had lo&s;t the Hill, and found a new Country in view, which Chat&s;|worth it&s;elf had never &s;een before.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e indeed had received Ad|ditions&punc; as it did every Year, $word$ perhaps would to this Day&punc; had th$ Duke liv'd, who had a Genius $o$ &s;uch Things beyond the $each of the mo&s;t $$rfect Ma&s;ters, and was not only capable to de&s;ign, but to fini&s;h</P>
<P>The Gardens, the Water-works, the Ca&s;cades, the Statues, Va$a and Painting, tho' they are but very imperfectly de|&s;cribed by any of the Writers who have yet named them, and more imperfectly by one Author, who has &s;o lately pre|tended to View them; yet I dare not venture to m$$$ion them here lea&s;t, for want of time, and having &s;o long a Jour|ney to go&punc; I &s;hould, l ke tho&s;e who have gone before me&punc; do $t imp$$$ectly, or leave no room to do Ju&s;tice $o other Per|&s;ons and Places, which I am &s;till to men|tion. I &s;hall therefore, as I &s;aid above, only touch at what others have omit|ted.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, 'tis to be ob&s;erved that on the Ea&s;t Si$e ri&s;es a very high Mountain, on the top of which they dig Mill &s;tones, and it begins &s;o clo&s;e to, and &s;o overlgoks the Hou&s;e, being prodigiou&s;ly high that, &s;hould they roll down a pair of tho&s;e Stones coupled with a wooden Axis, as is the way of drawing them, they would in|fallibly give a Shock to the Building; yet this Mountain is &s;o planted, and &s;o cover|ed with a Wood of beautiful Trees, that you &s;ee no Hill, only a ri&s;ing Wood, as if the Trees grew &s;o much higher than one another, and was only a Wall of Trees, who&s;e tops join into one another &s;o clo&s;e, as nothing is &s;een through them.</P>
<P>Upon the top of that Mountain begins a va&s;t extended Moo$ or Wa&s;te, which,
<PB REF="368">
for fifteen or &s;ixteen Miles together due North, pre&s;ents you with neither Hedge, Hou&s;e or Tree, but a wa&s;te and houl|ing Wilderne&s;s, over which when Strang|ers travel, they are obliged to take Guides, or it would be next to impo&s;&s;ible not to lo&s;e their way.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more &s;urpri&s;ing of its Kind, than for a Stranger coming from the North, &s;uppo&s;e from Sheffield in York&s;hire, for that is the fir&s;t Town of Note, and wandering or labouring to pa&s;s this difficult De&s;art Country, and &s;eeing no $nd of it, and almo&s;t di&s;couraged and heaten out with the Fatigue of it, (ju&s;t &s;uch was our Ca&s;e) on a &s;udden the Guide br$ngs him to this Precipice, where he look$ down from a frightf$l heighth, and a com$$ttle$s, barren, and, as he thought, endle&s;s Moor, into the mo&s;t delightful Valley, with the mo&s;t plea|&s;ant Gard$$, and mo$ beautiful Palace in the World. If contraries illu&s;trate, and the $$ace can admit or any Illu&s;tration, $t m$$t needs add to the Splendor of t$e &s;ituation, and to the Beauty of the Building, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, with which I will clo&s;e my &s;hort Ob&s;ervation. If there is any wonder in Chat&s;worth, it is that any Man who had a Genius &s;uitable to &s;o magnificent a De&s;ign, who could lay out the Plan for &s;uch a Hou&s;e, and had a Fund to &s;upport the Charge, would build it in &s;uch a Place where the moun|tains in&s;ult the Clouds, intercept the Sun, and would threaten, were Earthquakes frequent here, to buy the very Towns, much more the Hou&s;e, in their Ruins.</P>
<P>On the top of the Mountain, that is to &s;ay, on the Plain which extends from it, is a large Pond or Ba&s;in for Water, &s;preading as I was told, near thirty Acres of Ground, which, from all the A&s;cents round it, receives, as into a Ci&s;tern, all the water that falls, and from which again by Pipes, the Ca&s;cades, Water|works, Ponds, and Canals in the Gar|dens, are plentifully &s;upplied.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t &s;ide, which is the Front or Entrance of the Hou&s;e, and where the fir&s;t Foundre&s;s built a very augu&s;t Por|tal or Gate; I &s;ay, on the We&s;t &s;ide, runs the River Derwent, which, though not many Miles from it, &s;ource here, is yet a terrible River, when, by $a&s;ty Rains, or by the melting of the S$ows, the Hills are plea&s;ed to $span$ waters into its Channel; $word$ the Cur|rent is &s;o rapid&punc; and it has to many con|tracted Pa&s;&s;ages among the Rocks, and &s;o many little Cataracts among the &s;tones of which &s;ometimes we &s;ee &s;ome o$ an incredible Bulk come rowling down its Stream; I &s;ay, there are &s;o many $word$ the&s;e, that the River, on the lea&s;t Mo|tion of its waters above their ordinary heighth, roars like the Breaches on the Shores of the Sea.</P>
<P>Over this River there is a &s;tately Stone Bridge, with an ancient $word$ upon it, and in an I&s;land in the $word$ an ancient Fabrick all of Stone, and $word$ like a Ca&s;tle. All the&s;e are the Works of the fir&s;t Foundre&s;s, the Counte$s o$ Shrewsbury, and &s;hew the greatne$s o$ the fir&s;t De&s;ign; but except the Bridge are now, as it were, eclips'd by the mo|dern Glories of the later Ed$$ice.</P>
<P>In my Di&s;cour&s;e of the Palace of Cha$$|worth mu&s;t not be forgot that $am$ Compliment which the Mare$chal $word$ de Tall$rd pa&s;s'd upon it, when the $word$ of Devon&s;hire entertained him at Cha$$|worth, namely, <Q>&startq;&endq;That when he $word$ give his Ma&s;ter the King of $word$ the Hi&s;tory of his &s;even Years $word$ in England, he would leave $word$ tho&s;e three Days which he had $word$ &s;o agreeable with his Grace, in $word$ the fine&s;t Palace in the World.</Q></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t dwell no longer here, how|ever plea&s;ant and agreeable the $word$ The remaining Article, and which $word$ grant, we may ju&s;tly call a WONDER is Elden Hole. The De&s;cription of $word$ in brief, is this: In the middle of a $word$ open Field, gently de&s;cending to the South, there is a frightful Cha$me, $word$ rather in the Rock, for the $word$ &s;eems thereabouts to be all but one $word$
<PB REF="369">
Rock; this opening goes directly down perpendicular into the Earth and per|haps to the Center; it may be about twenty Foot over one way, and fifty or &s;ixty the other; it has no Bottom, that is to &s;ay, none that can yet be heard of Mr. Cotton &s;ays, he let down eight hundred Fathoms of Li$e into it, and that the Plummet drew &s;till; &s;o that, in a word&punc; he founded about a Mile per|pendicular; for as we call a Mile 1760 Yards, and 884 is above half, then doubt|le&s;s eight hundred Fathoms mu&s;t be 1600 Yards which is near a Mile.</P>
<P>This I allow to be a Wonder, and what the like of is not to be found in the World, that I have heard of, or be|lieve. And would former Writers have been contented with one Wonder in&s;tead of &s;even, it would have done more Hon|our to the Peak, and even to the whole Nation, than the adding five imaginary Miracles to it that had nothing in them, and which really depreciated the whole.</P>
<P>What Nature meant in leaving this Window open into the infernal World, if the Place lies that way, we cannot tell: But it mu&s;t be &s;aid, there is &s;ome|thing of Horror upon the very imagi|nation, when one does but look into it; and therefore tho' I cannot find much in Mr. Cotton, of merry Memory, worth quoting, yet on this Subject, I think, he has four very good Lines, &s;peaking of his having an involuntary Horror at look|ing into this Pit. The Words are the&s;e:</P>
<LG>
<L>"For he, who &s;tanding on the Brink of Hell,</L>
<L>"Can carry it &s;o unconcern'd and well,</L>
<L>"As to betray no Fear, is certainly</L>
<L>"A better Chri&s;tian, or a wor&s;e than I.</L>
<L><BIBL><HI>Cotton</HI>'s Wonders of the Peak.</BIBL></L>
</LG>
<P>They tell a di&s;mal &s;tory here, of a Tra|veller, who enquiring his way to Ca&s;t|$$$$, or to Buxton, in a dark Night, two $word$ offer'd to guide him; but, in|$e$ding to rob him, led him to the edge of this Gulph, and either thru&s;t him in, $rper&s;uaded him to believe there was a $t$le Gall of Water, and b$d him take a $rge Step, which the innocent Unfortu|$ate did, no$ mi&s;tru&s;ting the Treachery, $word$ $$ept at once into E ernity; a Story $ough to make the Blood run cold $rough the Heart of tho&s;e that hear it $ld, e&s;pecially if they know the Place $o: They add, that one of the&s;e Vil|$ns being han$ed at Derby &s;ome Years $er for &s;ome other Vill$ny, confe&s;s'd $s Murther at the Gallows.</P>
<P>Having then viewed tho&s;e Things $word$ an impartial Mind, give me leave $r$duce the Wonders of the Peak to a $word$ Number, and of a quite different $d</P>
<P N="1">1. Elden Hole I acknowlege to be a wonderful Place, as I have &s;aid above but to me the greate&s;t Surprize is, that; after &s;uch a real Wonder, any of the T$i$, fles added to it could bear the Name of Wonders</P>
<P N="2">2 Of Buxton; the Wonder to me is, that in a Nation &s;o full of Chronical di&s;|ea&s;es as we are, &s;uch as our Sco$buticks, Rheumaticks Cholicks, and Niphritick$, there &s;hould be &s;uch a Foundation of Me|dicine &s;ent from Heaven, and no more notice taken of it, or care to make it u&s;eful.</P>
<P N="3">3. That in a Nation &s;o curious, &s;o in|quiring, and &s;o critical as this is, any thing &s;o un&s;atisfying, &s;o foli&s;h and &s;o weak, &s;hould pa&s;s for Wonders at tho&s;e Mam Tor, Tide &s;well, Poole's Hole, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. As to Chat&s;worth, the Wonder, as I &s;aid before, &s;eems to me; not that &s;o noble and magni&s;icent a Palace &s;hould be built, but that it &s;hould be built in &s;uch a Manner and Situation, and in
<PB REF="370">
&s;uch a Country &s;o out of the way, &s;o concealed from the World, that who|ever &s;ees it mu&s;t take a Journey on pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Having thus viewed the two Countries of Nottingham and Derby, as beginning that Part of England, which we call North by Trent, I re&s;olved to go Northward on the Ea&s;t Side of the I&s;land, taking the We&s;tern Shore, or the Iri&s;h Sea in my return.</P>
<P>The Peak concludes the Northern Part of Derby&s;hire; nor are there any Towns on that Side worth noting. There are &s;ome other Curio&s;ities in the Peak in|deed, which would de&s;erve a fuller Ac|count, had I lei&s;ure to enlarge or de&s;cend to Particulars, as the Tottering Stones at Byrch Over, the Roman Cau&s;eway, called Bath Gate, the &s;everal Minerals found in the Hills, and in the Lead Mines, as Black Lead, Stibium or Anti|mony, Chri&s;tal, and other Things, all much more rare than the Wonders they &s;peak of.</P>
<P>Bakewell, is the be&s;t Town in the North We&s;t Side of the Peak, near which the Duke of Rutland has a very noble Palace, called Haddon; but after Chat&s;|worth no Hou&s;e in the &s;ame County can bear a De&s;cription; &s;o we left the Peak, and went to Che&s;terfield, a hand&s;ome Market Town at the northermo&s;t Border of the County, North Ea&s;t from Chat&s;|worth.</P>
<P>There is indeed an extended Angle of this County, which runs a great way North We&s;t by Cappel in the Frith, and which they call High Peak. This, per|haps, is the mo&s;t de&s;olate, wild, and aban|doned Country in all England; the Moun|tains of the Peak, of which I have been &s;peaking, &s;eem to be but the beginning of Wonders to this Part of the Country, and but the beginning of Mountains, or, if you will, as the lower Rounds of a Ladder. The tops of the&s;e Hills &s;eem to be as much above the Clouds, as the Clouds are above the ordinary Range of Hills&punc;</P>
<P>Nor is this all; but the Countinuance of the&s;e Mountains is &s;uch, that we know no Bounds &s;et to them, but they run on in a continued Ridge or Ledge of Moun|tains from one to another, till they ar$ lo&s;t in the Southern Parts of Scotland, and even through that to the Highlands; &s;o that they may be &s;aid to divide Bri|tain, as the Appennine Mountains di|vide Italy. Thus the&s;e Hills joyning to Black&s;tone Edge divide York&s;hire from Lanca&s;hire, and going on North divi$$$ the Bi&s;hoprick of Durham from W$$$|moreland, and &s;o on. It is from $word$ Ridge of Mountains that all the Rivers in the North of England take their $word$ I may &s;ay ALL, for it is &s;o to a very trifle, not a con&s;iderable River North of this County too, but begin here; th $e on the Ea&s;t Side run into the German Ocean, tho&s;e on the We&s;t Side into of Iri&s;h. I &s;hall begin the Ob&s;ervation here&punc; the Dove and the Derwent ri&s;e both at this South End of them, and come away South to the Trent; but all the Rivers afterwards run, as above, Ea&s;t or We&s;t, and fir&s;t the Mer&s;ee ri&s;es on the We&s;t Side and the Don on the Ea&s;t, the $word$ runs to Warrington, #and into the S$$ at Liverpoole; the other to $word$, and into the Sea at Humber. I &s;hall $word$ on the Ob&s;ervation as I go, for to g$ve an Account of Rivers, is the true guide to the giving the Reader the be&s;t Account $word$ the Country. But to return to my $word$.</P>
<P>Che&s;terfield is a hand&s;ome pop$$$$ Town, well built and well inhabited, notwith&s;tanding it &s;tands in the farthe&s; Part of this rocky Country; for long on the North We&s;t Side next to York|&s;hire, it enters Scar&s;dale, which is a $ich fruitful Part of the Country, though $$|rounded with barren Moors and M$$$|tains, for &s;uch the Name Scar&s;dale &s;ign $word$ according to that Ma&s;ter of $span$ Mr. Cambden. Here is, how ever, $word$ remarkable in this Town but a $ree $word$ and a very good Market, well &s;tored with Provi&s;ions; for here is little or no Manu|facture.</P>
<P><PB REF="371">
From hence (travelling &s;till North) $e ca$red the great County of York, $ncerta$n &s;till which way to begin to $ake a full View of it, for as 'tis a Coun|$ry of a very great Extent, my Bu&s;ine&s;s $s not the &s;ituation of a meer Geogra|phical de&s;cription of it; I have nothing to do with the Longitude of Places, the Antiquities of Towns. Corporations, Buildings, Charters, &amp;c. nor much with the Hi&s;tory of Men, Families, Ciites or Towns, but to give you a View of the whole in its pre&s;ent State, as al&s;o of the Commerce, Curio&s;ities and Cu&s;toms, according to my Title.</P>
<P>The County is divided into three Rid|ings; as I entred it from the South, it follows, I went in, by what they call the We&s;t-Riding, which, as it is by much the large&s;t, &s;o it is the wealthie&s;t and the mo&s;t populous, has the greate&s;t Towns $n it, and the greate&s;t Number of them; the greate&s;t Manufactures, and con&s;e|quently the greate&s;t &s;hare of Wealth, as it has al&s;o of People.</P>
<P>Two eminent Towns, tho' only meer Market Towns, and one of them no Corporation, open the Door into the We&s;t Riding of York&s;hire; the&s;e are Shef|field and Donca&s;ter. It is true, there is a little Market Town, at the very fir&s;t Entrance into the County before we come to Donca&s;ter. call'd Beautry, a Town ble&s;sd with two great Conveniencies which a&s;&s;i&s;ts to its Support, and makes it a very well frequented Place.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it &s;tands upon the great Po&s;t Highway, or Road from London to Scot|land; and this makes it be full of very good Iuns and Hou&s;es of Entertain|m nt.</P>
<P N="2">2 That the little but plea&s;ant River I$le runs through, or rather ju&s;t by, the &s;ide of it, which, contrary to the im|port of its Name, is a full and quick, though not rapid and un&s;afe Stream, with a deep Channel, which carries Hoys, Lighters, Barges, or flat-bottom'd Ve&s;&s;els out of its Channel into the Trent, which comes within &s;even Mile of it, to a Place called Stockwith, and from thence to Burton, and from thence, in fair Wea|ther quite to Hull; but if not, 'tis &s;uf|ficient to go to Stockwith, where Ve&s;&s;els of 200 Ton Burthen may come up to the Town loaden as well as empty</P>
<P>By this Navigation, this Town of Ba$|try becomes the Center of all the Ex|portation of this Part of the Country, e&s;pecially for heavy Goods, which they bring down hither from all the adjacent Countries, &s;uch as Lead, from the Smelt|ing-Hou&s;es in Derby&s;hire, wrought Iron and Edge-Tools, of all Sorts, from the Forges at Sheffield, and from the Coun|try call'd Hallam&s;hire, being adjacent to the Towns of Sheffield and Rotherham, where an innumerable Number of Peo|ple are employed; as I &s;hall&s;peak more largely of in its Place.</P>
<P>Al&s;o Mill&s;tones and Grind&s;tones, in very great Quantities, are brought down and &s;hipped off here, and &s;o carry'd by Sea to Hull, and to London, and even to Holland al&s;o. This makes Bea$try Wharf be famous all over the South Part of the We&s;t-Riding of York&s;hire, for it is the Place whether all their heavy Goods are carried, to be embarked and &s;hipped off.</P>
<P>From hence ro Donca&s;ter is a plea&s;ant Road, and good Ground, and never wants any Repair, which is very hard to be &s;aid in any Part of this lower &s;ide of the Country.</P>
<P>Donca&s;ter is a noble, large, &s;pacious Town, exceeding populous, and a great manufacturing Town, principally for Knitting; al&s;o as it &s;tands upon the great Northern Po&s;t Road, it is very full of great Inns; and here we found our Land|lord at the Po&s;t hou&s;e was Mayor of the Town as well as Po&s;t Ma&s;ter, that he kept a Pack of Hounds, was Com|pany for the be&s;t Gentlemen in the Town or in the Neighbourhood, and lived as great as any Gentleman ordina|rily did.</P>
<P>Here we &s;aw the fir&s;t Remains or Ruins of the great Roman Highway,
<PB REF="372">
which, though we could not perceive it before, was eminent and remarkable here, ju&s;t at the Entrance into the Town; and &s;oon after appeared again in many Places: Here are al&s;o two great, lofty, and very &s;trong Stone Bridges over the Don, and a long Cau&s;eway al&s;o beyond the Bridges, which is not a little dan|gerous to Pa&s;&s;engers when the Waters of the Don are re&s;trained, and &s;well over its Banks, as is &s;ometimes the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>This Town, Mr. Cambden &s;ays, was burnt entirely to the Ground, Anno 759, and is hardly recovered yet; but I m$&s;t &s;ay, it is &s;o well recovered, that I &s;ee no Ruins appear, and indeed, being al|mo&s;t a thou&s;and Years ago, I know not how there &s;hould; and be&s;ides, the Town &s;eems as if it wanted another Conflagration, for it looks old again, and many of the Hou&s;es ready to fall.</P>
<P>I &s;hould, before I leave Donca&s;ter, give you the famous Epitaph of one Robert Byrk, a famous Man of Donca|&s;ter, who lies buried in the great Church here, who gave a Place call'd Ro&s;&s;ing|ton Wood, to the Poor. On his Grave is this Epitaph in old Engli&s;h:</P>
<LG>
<L>Howe, Howe, who's here,</L>
<L>I, Robin of Donca&s;tere,</L>
<L>And Margaret my Fere,</L>
<L>That I &s;pent, that I had;</L>
<L>That I gave, that I have;</L>
<L>That I left, that I lo&s;t;</L>

<L>Three&s;core Years and &s;even, but liv'd not one.</L>
<L><BIBL><HI>Anno</HI> 1579.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>Here lies al&s;o, under a plain Grave &s;tone in St. George's Church, $word$ the Body of one Thomas Ellis, a $word$ memorable Per&s;on. He was five $word$ Mayor of the Town, founded an $word$ in the Town, called St. $word$ the Apo&s;tle, and endowed it $word$.</P>
<P>Strange! that of but two &s;everal Au|thors writing a De&s;cription of $word$ $ but very lately, and pretending to $word$ po&s;itively of the Places, which they ought not to have done, if they $word$ been there, both of them &s;hould &s;o &s;trange|ly mi&s;take, as one to &s;ay of Donca&s;ter, that there was a large Church with a high Spire Steeple and the other to &s;ay of the Cathedral at York, that from the Sp$$ of the Cathedral at York, you have an unbounded Pro&s;pect: Whereas neither has the Tower of York, or the Tower at Don|ca&s;ter, any Spire, unle&s;s they will pre|tend any of the &s;mall Pinacles at the $word$ Corners of the two Towers at the W$&s;t End of the Church at York, are to $e call'd THE SPIRE of THE Cathedra$; &s;o fit are &s;uch Men to write De&s;cript$ces of a Country.</P>
<P>Leaving Donca&s;ter, we turned out of the Road at little way to the left, where we had a fair View of that antient $word$ making, Cutlering Town, called Sheffield, the Antiquity, not of the Town only&punc; but of the Trade al&s;o, is e&s;tabli&s;hed $word$ tho&s;e famous Lines of Geo&s;try $word$ on the Miller of Trumpington, which, however they vary from the print in Chaucer, as now extant, I give it you as I find it:</P>
<LG>
<L>At <HI>Trumpington,</HI> not far from <HI>Cambridge,</HI></L>
<L>There dwelt a Miller upon a Bridge;</L>
<L>With a rizzl'd Beard, and a hooked No&s;e,</L>
<L>And a Whittl in his Ho&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<P>This Town of Sheffield is very po|pulous and large, the Streets narrow, and the Hou&s;es dark and black, occa|&s;ioned by the continued Smoke of the Forges, which are always at work: Here they make all Sorts of Cutlery|ware,
<PB REF="373">
but &s;epecially that of Edged-Tools, Knives, Razors, Axes, &amp;c. and Nails; $nd here the only Mill of the Sort, which was in u&s;e in England for &s;ome time was $et up, viz. for turning their Grind&s;tones, though now 'tis grown more common.</P>
<P>Here is a very &s;pacious Church, with very hand&s;ome and high Spire; and the Town is &s;aid to have at lea&s;t as many, if $ot more People in it than the City of $ork. Whether they have been exactly $umbered one again&s;t the other. I can|$ot tell. The Manufacture of Hard Ware, $hich has been &s;o antient in this Town&punc; not $word$ continued, but much encrea&s;ed; $word$ much that they told us there, the $ands employed in it were a prod$ious $word$ more than $ver dwelt, as well in $word$ as in the Bounds of that they $word$ Hallam&s;hire; and they talked of 30000 $word$ employed in the whole; but I leave upon the Credit of Report.</P>
<P>There was formerly a very &s;ine Ca&s;tle $word$ with a noble Man&s;ion-Hou&s;e, the $$t of the Dukes of Norfolk; but it is $$w all demoli&s;hed and decayed, though $$ E&s;tate or Manor remains &s;till in the $nly. In the great Church of this Town $ &s;everal very antient Monuments of the $nly of Talbots, Earls of Shrewsbury, $o once had great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in this the next County.</P>
<P>The Queen of Scots was al&s;o for a long $e detained here as Pri&s;oner, not lets $n &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen Years, which $ fatal afterward to the Hou&s;e of Nor|$$; as is to be &s;een at large in $word$ $word$ Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The $word$ $word$ $word$ a rapid terrible $span$ its Banks, and done $span$ Damage the &s;ame Year $span$ this View, having carried $$ two or three Stone Bridges, plough|$$p $ me Whar&s;$, and drove away $tal Mills; for this River is of Kin to the Derwent for the Fiercene&s;s of its Streams, taking its Begings in the &s;ame We&s;tern Mountains, which I men|tioned before; and which began to u&s;e fir&s;t in the High Peak, and run North|ward to Black&s;tone Edge; the&s;e Moun|tains pouring down their Wat $$ with &s;uch Fury into the&s;e great Rivers, their Streams are &s;o rapid, that nothing is able to &s;tand in their way.</P>
<P>Here is a &s;ine Engine or Mill al&s;o for rai&s;ing Water to &s;upply the Town, which was done by Mr $$$ocoal, the &s;ame who fell into the River at the Throwing Mill at Derby, as is &s;aid in its Place: Here is al&s;o a very large and &s;trong Bridge over the Don, as there is another at Rother|ham, a Market Town &s;ix Miles lower. Here is al&s;o a very fine Ho&s;pital, with the Addition of a good Revenue, &s;ettled at fir&s;t by Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, and confirmed afterwards by the Family of Howard, Dukes of Norfolk.</P>
<P>George, the fir&s;t Earl of Shrewbury, who died 1538. George the &s;econd, Grand&s;on to the fir&s;t, to who&s;e Cu&s;tody the Queen of Scots was committed, who died 1590, and Gilbert his Son, who founded the Ho&s;pital above mentioned, all lie buried here.</P>

<P>It is in this Park that the great Oak Tree grew, which Mr. Evenlyn gives a long Account of in his Book of Fore&s;t Trees; but as I did not &s;ee it, I
<PB REF="374">
refer to the &s;aid Mr. Evelyn's Account. The Che&s;nut Tree near Aderclift, which Mr. Camden's Continuator mentions, the Body of which could hardly be &s;athom'd by three Men, I &s;uppo&s;e was gone&punc; for I could hear nothing of it.</P>
<P>But the Remains of the Roman Fortifi|cation or Encampment between Sheffield and Rotherham, is there &s;till, and very plain to be &s;een, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, may re|main &s;o to the End of Time.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o the famous Bauk or Trench which &s;ome call Devil's Bank, others Danes Bank; but 'tis frequent with us to give the Honour of &s;uch great Trenches, which they think was never worth the while for Men to dig, to the Devil, as if he had more lei&s;ure, or that it was le&s;s trouble to him than to a whole Army of Men. This Bank, 'tis &s;aid, runs five Miles in Length; in &s;ome Places 'tis called Kemp Bank, in others Temple's Bank.</P>
<P>Rotherham was the next Town of any Bulk, in which, however, I &s;aw nothing of Note, except a fine Stone Bridge over the Don, which is here encrea&s;ed by the River Rother, from whence the Town, I &s;uppo&s;e, took its Name, as the famous Bi&s;hop Rotherham did his from the Town; I will not &s;ay he was a &s;oundling Child in the Streets, and &s;o was &s;irnamed from the Place, as is often &s;ugge&s;ted in &s;uch Ca&s;es, though, if he was &s;o, it did not dimini&s;h his Character, which was that of a great and good Man. He was Arch|bi&s;hop of York, and was a great Bene|factor to this Town, having founded a College here; but it &s;eems it has been a long while ago.</P>
<P>From Rotherham we turned North We&s;t to Wentworth, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee the old Seat of Tanker&s;ly, and the Park, where I &s;aw the large&s;t Red Deer that, I be|lieve, are in this Part of Europe: One of the Hinds, I think, was larger than my Hor&s;e, and he was not a very &s;mall Pad of fourteen Hands and half high. This was antiently the Dwelling of the great Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, beheaded in King Charles the Fir&s;t's time by a Law, <HI>expo&s;t facto,</HI> voted afterward not to be drawn into a Precedent. The Body lies interred in Wentworth Church</P>
<P>Thence over va&s;t Moors, I had almo$$ &s;aid wa&s;te Moors, we entred the mo&s;t populous Part of this County, I m$$$ that of travelling in the We&s;t Riding only pa&s;&s;ing a Town call'd Black Ba$$ley, eminent &s;till for the working in $word$ and Steel; and indeed the very To$$ looks as black and &s;moaky as if they were all Smiths that lived in it, tho$$ is not, I &s;uppo&s;e, called Black Bar$$$$ on that Account, but for the black Has or Colour of the Moors, which, being covered with Heath, (or Heather, as $$s called in that Country) look all black like Bag&s;hot Heath, near Wind&s;or; after, I &s;ay, we had pa&s;s'd the&s;e Moors, we came to a mo&s;t rich, plea&s;ant and $word$ Country, and the fir&s;t Town of note we came to in it was Wakefield, at large hand&s;ome, rich clothing Town, full or People, and full of Trade.</P>
<P>The Calder pa&s;&s;es through this Town under a &s;tately Stone Bridge of $word$ Arches, upon which is a famous Build|ing, by &s;ome called a Chapel, by others a Ca&s;tle; the former is the mo&s;t likely: It was built by Edward the Fourth, $$ Memory of the fatal Battle of Wa$$|field, wherein his Father, Richard, Duke of York, was killed by the Lanca&s;$$$ Army, under the Command of Margare$, Queen to Henry the Sixth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1460. It was indeed a fatal Battle; but as this is not any Part of this Work, I leave it to the Hi&s;torians to give a fuller Ac|count of it; only one Thing I mu&s;t add, namely, that a little on this Side of the Town, I mean South between Wake|field, and a Village called Sandal, they &s;hewed us a little &s;quare Piece of Ground, which was &s;enced off by it &s;elf; and on which, before the late War, &s;tood a large Stone Cro&s;s, in Memory of that $word$ Battle; ju&s;t upon that Spot, the Duke of York fighting de&s;perately, and refu&s;ing to yield, tho' &s;urrounded with Enemies,
<PB REF="375">
was kill'd. The Chapel on the Bridge at Wakefield, the other Monument of this Battle, is now made u&s;e of for Civil Af|fairs; for we do not now pray for the Souls of tho&s;e &s;lain in Battle, and &s;o the intent of that Building cea&s;es.</P>
<P>Wakefield is a clean, large, well-built Town, very populous and very rich; here is a very large Church, and well filled it is, for here are very few Di&s;&s;enters; the Steeple is a very fine Spite, and by far the highe&s;t in all this Part of the Coun|try, except that at Sheffield. They tell us, there are here more People al&s;o than in the City of York, and yet it is no Cor|poration Town; and the highe&s;t Magi&s;|trate, as I under&s;tand, was a Con&s;table.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o is a Market every Friday for Woollen, Cloaths&punc; after the manner of that at Leeds tho' not &s;o great; yet as all the Cloathing Trade is encrea&s;ing in this Country, &s;o this Market too flouri&s;hes with the re&s;t; not bat the &s;ometimes, as foreign Markets receive interruption ei|ther by Wars, by a glut of the Goods, or by any other incident, there are inter|ruptions of the Manufacture too, which, when it happen, the Clothiers are &s;ure to complain of lo&s;s of Trade; but when the demand comes again they are not equally forward with their Acknowledg|ments; and this, I ob&s;erved, was the ca&s;e every where el&s;e, as well as here.</P>
<P>I cannot pa&s;s by my former Ob&s;erva|$on here, namely, now evidently all the $reat Rivers take their Beginning in the $ountains of Black&s;tone Edge and High $$ak, which, as I have &s;aid, part of the $ounties of Lanca&s;ter and York, and $$w the&s;e Rivers take all their Cour&s;e $e Ea&s;t. The Don was the fir&s;t; the $xt is the Calder, coming now to be a $$y large River at Wakefield; and the $e is the next, which, running another $word$ of which I &s;hall &s;peak pre&s;ently, $e$ves the Calder into it.</P>
<P>The River Calder, of which I &s;hall $word$ an Account by and by, having tra|$$it from its beginning, receiving a migh&punc; Confluence of Rivers into it, is now, have &s;aid, become a large River, and the fir&s;t Town it comes near of Note is Huthersfield, another large Cloathing Place; it pa&s;&s;es al&s;o by Eland, where there is a very fine Stone Bridge. This was the original Seat of the Earls or Mar|qui&s;&s;es of Hallifax, when the Title went in the Name of Savile. Huthersfield is one of the five Towns which carry on that va&s;t Cloathing Trade by which the Wealth and Opulence of this Part of the Country has been rai&s;ed to what it now is, and where tho&s;e Woollen Manufactures are made in &s;uch prodigious Quantities, which are known by the Name of York|&s;hire Ke$&s;ies. Whether the Scandal rai&s;|ed upon this Country be ju&s;t or not (viz.) &s;hrinking Cloth and &s;harping K&mdash;s, that I will not take upon me to determine; at this Town there is a Market for Ker&s;ies every Tue&s;day.</P>
<P>Nor, as I &s;peak of their Manufactures, mu&s;t I forget that mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Manu|fucture called York&s;hire Ale, which in|deed is in its Perfection here, and in all this Part of the County; of which I &s;hall &s;peak again in its Place.</P>
<P>As the Calder ri&s;es in Black&s;tone Edge, &s;o the Aire, another of the York&s;hire Rivers, ri&s;es, tho' in the &s;ame Ridge of Hills, yet more particularly at the Foot of the Mountain Pennigent, on the Edge of Lanca&s;hire, of which 'tis &s;aid prover|bially:</P>
<LG>
<L>Pendle-Hill and Pennigent,</L>
<L>Are the highe&s;t Hills,</L>
<L>Between Scotland and Trent.</L>
</LG>
<P>As the Calder runs by Hallifax, Huthers|field, and through Wak$field; &s;o the Aire runs by Skippon, Bradforth and thorough Leeds, and then both join at Ca&s;tleford Bridge, near Pontefract, &s;o in an united Stream forming that u&s;eful Navigation from this trading part of York&s;hire to Hull; to the infinite Advantage of the whole Country, and which, as I took a &s;ingular Satisfaction in vi&s;iting and en|quiring into, &s;o I believe you will be no le&s;s delighted in reading the Account of it, which will be many Ways both u&s;e|ful
<PB REF="376">
and very in&s;tructive; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e none of the pretended Travel-Writers and Journeyers thro' England, have yet thought this mo&s;t remarkable Part of our Country worth their &s;peaking of, or knew not how to go about it: Nor have we &s;o much as mentioned this whole Part of England, which is, on many Accounts, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all the Northern Divi&s;ions of this Nation.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to take a View of this populous and wealthy Part, called the We&s;t Riding, at one, no, nor at two Journies, unle&s;s you &s;hould dwell upon it, and go cro&s;s the Country backward and forward, on Purpo&s;e to &s;ee this or that con&s;iderable Place. This is perhaps the Rea&s;on why, as I hinted above, the other Writers of Journies and Travels this Way might not &s;ee how to go about it. But, as I was re&s;olved to have a perfect Know|ledge of the mo&s;t remarkable Things, and e&s;pecially of the Manufactures of Eng|land, which I take to be as well worth a Traveller's Notice, as the mo&s;t curions Thing he can meet with, and which is &s;o prodigious great in this Quarter. I made no le&s;s than three Journies into, and thro', this Part of the Country.</P>
<P>In my fir&s;t Journey I came only We&s;t from York to Wakefield, and then, turn|ing South by Barn&s;ley or Donca&s;ter, went away &s;till South to Rotherham, Sheffield, Che&s;terfield, Chat&s;worth, and the Peak, all which Journey, except York, and the Towns about it, and in the Way to it, I have mentioned already.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Journey, I came out of the We&s;tern Part of England, namely, from Che&s;hire thro' Lanca&s;hire, and, pa&s;|&s;ing We&s;t over tho&s;e Andes of England, called Black&s;tone Edge, and the Mountains, which, as I hinted before, part York&s;hire and Lanca&s;hire, and reach from the High Peak to Scotland, I came to Hallifax, Bradforth, Huthersfield, Leeds, Wetherby, Pontefact and Burrow Bridge, and &s;o went away into the Ea&s;t Riding, as you have hear.</P>
<P>The third Journey, I went from the Peak in Derby&s;hire again, and, traver&s;ing the &s;ame Country as I returned by in the fir&s;t Journey as far as Wakefield, went on again North to Leeds, and thence over Harwood Bridge to Knaresborough Spaw, thence to Rippon, and thro' that old Ro|man Street-way, called Le$ming-Lane, to Pier's Bridge, thence to Durham, and $o into Scotland; of all which in their Ord$$.</P>
<P>If, by all the&s;e Circuits, and traver&s;ing the Country &s;o many Ways, which I name for the Rea&s;ons above, I am $word$ furni&s;hed to give a particular Account of the mo&s;t remarkable Things, I mu&s;t have &s;pent my Time very ill, and ought not to let you know how often I went thro' $word$.</P>
<P>In my &s;econd Journey, as above, I came from Lanca&s;hire, where you are to note, that all this Part of the Country is &s;o con&s;iderable for its Trade, that the Po&s;t-Ma&s;ter General had thought &s;$t to e&s;tabli&s;h a Cro&s;s-Po&s;t thro' all the W$&s;t$$n Part of England into it, to mainta$n the Corre&s;pondence of Merchants and $word$ of Bu&s;ine&s;s, of which all this Side of the I&s;land is &s;o full; this is a Confirmation of what I have &s;o often repeated&punc; and may &s;till repeat many times on farther Occa|&s;ion, of the Greatne&s;s of the Trade carri|ed on in this Part of the I&s;land. Th$$ Cro&s;s Po&s;t begins at Plymou$h, in the South We&s;t Part of England, and, leav$$g the great We&s;tern Po&s;t Road of Ex$$$$er behind, comes away North to Tann$$$, Bridgwater and Bri&s;tol; from thence gees on thro' all the great Cities and Tow$s up the Severn; &s;uch as Glouce&s;ter, Wer|ce&s;ter, Bridgenorth and Shrewsbury, th$$$e by We&s;t Che&s;ter to Liverpool and W$$|rington, from whence it turns away $word$ and pa&s;&s;es to Manche&s;ter, Bury, $word$ Hallifax, Leeds and York, and $word$ at Hull.</P>
<P>By this Means the Merchants at $word$ have immediate Advice of their $word$ which go out of the Channel, and $word$ in; by their Letters from Plymouth, as readily as the Merchants at London, and without the double Charge of $word$ The Shop keepers and Manufactures $$n

corre&s;pond with their Dealers at Man|che&s;ter, Liverpool and B i&s;tol, n$y, even with Ireland directly; without the tedi|ous interrupt on or &s;ending their Letters about by London&punc; or employing People at London to forward their Packets; and as the Trade on this Side is exceeding great, this Corre&s;pondence is a mighty Advantage; nor is the encrea&s;e of the Revenue by it incon&s;iderable the Quantity of Letters which pa&s;s and repa&s;s $word$ way, being, as I was told, in all Pla|ces great.</P>
<P>$span$ this Po&s;t Road, from $span$ and Rochdale, both $span$ in Lanca&s;hire, and the $span$ for a Sort of cour&s;e $word$ called $alf ticks and Ke$&s;ies, and the $word$ for them is very great tho' $span$ Town is &s;ituated $span$ the Way, and &s;o at the very $word$ of the Mountains, that we may $ppo&s;e it would be but little frequented.</P>
<P>Here, for our great Encouragement&punc; though we were but at the middle of $word$ and in &s;ome Places the Harve&s;t was got in, we &s;aw the Mountains $word$ with Snow, and felt the Cold $word$ and piercing; but even here we $and, as in all tho&s;e Northern Coun|ries is the Ca&s;e, the People had an ex|$aordinary Way of mixing the warm $span$ cold very happily together; for $he &s;tore of good Ale which flows pie$ $span$ in the mo&s;t mountainous Part of this $word$ &s;eems abundantly to make up $span$ the inclemencies of the Sea&s;on, $word$ difficul ies of Travelling, adding al&s;o $word$ plenty of Co$s for firing, which all $word$ Hills are full of.</P>
<P>We mounted the Hills &s;$rti$ied with $span$ early in the $span$ the S$ow which had $span$ up$$ the $word$ yet we thought it was $span$ the Morning being calm and $span$ of a$ $span$ neither did the People $word$ who kindly directed us the Way, and even offered to $span$ the fir&s;t Mountains, $span$ Difficulty for us, $o we $span$ our &s;elves out of their $span$ we afterwards very much $span$</P>
<P>It was, as I &s;ay, calm a $span$ the Sun &s;ho$e wh$$ we came $span$ Town of $span$ but when we $span$ to mount the $word$ which we $span$ in a M$le, or little m r$ of the $span$ we found the Wind began to $span$ the higher we want the more $span$ which I &s;oon perceived that it $word$ blow$ befo e, and perhaps all N$ght upon the Hills, tho' it was calm be$ow; as we a&s;cended higher it began to know again, that is to &s;ay, we a&s;cended in|to that Part where it was $span$ and $span$ doubt, been Snowing all Night&punc; as we could ea&s;ily &s;ee by the thick|ne&s;s of the Snow.</P>
<P>It is not $word$ to expre&s;s the Con&s;ter|nation we were in when we came up near he Top of the Mountain; the Wind blow exceeding hard indeed, and blew the Snow $span$ in our Faces, and that &s;o thick, $word$ it was impo&s;&s;ible to keep our $span$ to &s;ee our way. The Ground al&s;o was &s;o covered with Snow, that we could &s;ee no Trick, or when we were $n the Way, or when out, ex|cept when we were &s;howed it by a $word$ $word$ on one Hand, and uneven $word$ on the other; even our Hor&s;es $word$ their Unea&s;ine&s;s at it; and $span$ that was my fel|low $word$ and u&s;ually diverted us with $span$ Mark for our Gun, turn'd tail $o it and $word$.</P>
<P>In the $span$ of this Difficulty, and as we began to $word$ $o one another to turn back again, not knowing what Dangers might &s;till be before us, came a &s;urpri|&s;ing Clap of Thunder, the fir&s;t that ever I heard in a &s;torm of Snow, or, I believe, ev r &s;hall; nor did we perceivd any $ightning to precede the Thunder, as mu&s;t naturally be the Ca&s;e; but we &s;up|po&s;e the thick falling of the Snow might prevent our Sight.</P>
<P><PB REF="378">
I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was very much &s;ur|prized at this Blow; and one of our Com|pany would not be per&s;uaded that it was Thunder, but that it was &s;ome Bla&s;t of a Coal Pit, things which do &s;ometimes hap|pen in the Country, where there are ma|ny Coal Mines. But we were all again&s;t him in that, and were fully &s;atisfied that it was Thunder, and, as we fancyed, at la&s;t we were confirmed in it, by hearing more of it at a Di&s;tance from us.</P>
<P>Upon this we made a full Stop, and coming altogether, for we were then three in Company, with two Servants, we be|gan to talk &s;eriou&s;ly of going back again to Rochdale; but ju&s;t then one of our Men called out to us, and &s;aid, he was up|on the Top of the Hill, and could &s;ee over into York&s;hire, and that there was a plain Way down on the other Side.</P>
<P>We rode all up to him, and found it as the Fellow had &s;aid, all but that of a plain Way; there was indeed the Mark or Face of a Road on the Side of the Hill, a little turning to the left North; but it was &s;o narrow, and &s;o deep a hol|low Place on the right, whence the Wa|ter de&s;cending from the Hills made a Chan|nel at the bottom, and looked as the be|ginning of a River, that the depth of the Precipice, and the narrowne&s;s of the Way, looked horrible to us; after going a little way in it, the Way being blinded too by the Snow, the hollow on the right appeared deeper and deeper, &s;o we re&s;olv|ed to alight and lead our Hor&s;es, which we did for about a Mile, though the violence of the Wind and Snow continu|ing, it was both very trouble&s;ome and dangerous.</P>
<P>The only Reliefs we had in this Track were, (1.) That we perceived &s;ome Land Marks, or Tokens, which the hone&s;t Rochdale Men had given us notice of, by which we believed we were right in the Way; for till then we knew nothing where we were, or whether we were right or wrong. And, (2) that as the Road we were in de&s;cended apace, for it went very &s;teep down, we found the lower we went the Violence of the Snow abated, ju&s;t as on the other Side of the Hill the higher we went, it had encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>At lenghth, to our great Joy, we found too the Wind abated, as well as the Snow, that is to &s;ay, the Hills being &s;o high be|hind us, they kept back the Wind, as is the Ca&s;e under a high Wall, though $word$ are on the Windward Side of it, yet the Wind having no Pa&s;&s;age through, is $word$ felt, as it would be on the top where the Space is open for it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>All this Way the hollow on our right continued very deep, and ju&s;t on the o|ther Side of it a parallel H ll continued going on Ea&s;t, as that did which we rode on the Side of; the main Hill which we came down from, which is properly cal|led Black&s;tone Edge, or, by the Country People, the Edge, without any S$rname or Addition, ran along due North, cro&s;|&s;ing and &s;hutting up tho&s;e hollow Gulls and Vallies between, which were cer|tainly originally formed by the Rain and Snow Water running into them&punc; and forc|ing its way down wa&s;hing the Earth gra|dually along with it, till, by length of Time, it wore down the Surface to &s;uch a Depth.</P>
<P>We continued de&s;cending &s;till, and as the Weather was quieter, &s;o the Way &s;eemed to mend and be broader, and, to our great Satisfaction, enclining more to the Hill on the le&s;t; the precipice and hollow Part where the Water run, $word$ have &s;aid, went a little off from $word$ and by and by, to our no &s;mall Comfort, we &s;aw an enclo&s;ed Piece of Ground that is enclo&s;ed with a Stone Wall, and &s;oon af|ter a Hou&s;e, where we aked our way, $word$ found we were right.</P>
<P>Soon after this we came to the bottom, by another very &s;teep De&s;cent, where we were obliged to alight again, and lead our Hor&s;es. At the bottom, we found the hollow part, which I have &s;o often men|tioned as a Precipice, was come to a level with us, that is to &s;ay, we were come down to a level with it, and it turning to the left toward us, we found a Brook of
<PB REF="379">
$ater running form it, which cro&s;s'd our $ay to the North, you &s;hall hear of it $am pre&s;ently; when we cro&s;s'd this $ook, which, by rea&s;on of the Snow on $word$ Hills which melted, was ri&s;en about $word$ deep, and run like a Sluice for $rength, we found a few poor Hou&s;es, $word$ $aw no People, no not one; till we call$d at a Door, to get Directions of our Way, and then we found, that though there was no Body to be &s;een without $word$ they were very full of People within, and &s;o we found it on &s;everal Oc|ca&s;i$ns afterward, of which we &s;hall &s;peak again</P>
<P>We thought now we were come into $word$ C$$$&s;tian Country again, and that our Difficulties were over; but we &s;oon found $word$ mi&s;taken in the Matter; for we $ad not gone fifty Yards beyond the $word$ and Hou&s;es a jacent, $span$ $nd the Way began to a&s;cend again $span$ $fter to g$ up very &s;leep, till $span$ $alf a $word$ we $word$ we had a$ th$$ Mountain to a&s;cend, $word$ our appr$h$n&s;ion $s bad as the fir&s;t, and before we c$$e to the $word$ of it, we found it began to $now $oo, is it had done before</P>
<P>But, to cut &s;hort the tedious Day's Work the Ca&s;e was this; the Hill was very high and, in our Opinion, not in|$erior to the Edge which we came ju&s;t down from; but the Sun being higher, and the Wind not blowing &s;o hard, what Snow $$ll upon the Hill melted as it $$ll, and $o we &s;aw our Way plainer, and $word$ the Hill, though with &s;ome labour, $span$ any terror or apprehen&s;ions $f $word$ $ur Way, falling down, Precipices, $nd $span$</P>
<P>But our Ca&s;e was &s;till this; that as &s;oon $s $word$ were at the top of every Hill, we h$d it to come $own again on the o|ther $word$ and as &s;oon as we were down we had another to mount, and that $word$ for I do not remember that $word$ was one Bottom that had any $word$ Breadth of plain Ground in it, $lways a Brook in the Valley running $word$ tho&s;e Galls and Deeps between the Hills, with this Remark, that they always cro&s;s'd our Way in the Bottoms from the Right-hand to the Left, the Rea&s;on of which you &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>From Black&s;tone Edge to H$lli$ax is eight Miles, and all the Way, except from Sorby to Hallifax, is thus up Hill and down; &s;o that, I &s;uppo&s;e, we moun|ted to the Clouds and de&s;cended to the Water level about eight times, in that little Part of the Journey.</P>
<P>But now I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that after having pa&s;s'd the &s;econd Hill, and come do$n into the Valley again, and &s;o &s;till the nearer we came to Hallifax, we found the Hou&s;es thicker, and the Vil|lages greater in every Bottom: and not only $o, but the Sides of the Hills, which were very &s;leep every way, were &s;pread with Hou&s;es, and that very thick; for $word$ Land being divided into &s;mall Enclo|$u$$s, that is to &s;ay, from two Acres to &s;i$ or &s;even Acres each, &s;eldom more; every th$ee or four Pieces of Land had a Hou $ belonging to it.</P>
<P>Then it was I began to perceive the Rea$on and Nature of the Thing, and found that th$$ Di$i&s;ion of the Land into &s;mall Pieces, and &s;$$tt$ring of the Dwel|lings, was $word$ by, and done for the Conveni$nce of the Bu&s;ine&s;s which the People were generally employ'd in, and that, as I $word$ before, though we &s;aw no People &s;$r$ing without Doors, yet they were all full within; for, in &s;hort, this whole Country, however mountain|ous, and that no &s;ooner we were down one Hill bu we mounted another, is yet infini$ely full of People; tho&s;e People $word$ $$ll of Bu&s;ine&s;s; not a Beggar, not an $$le P$r&s;on to be &s;een, except here and there an Alms-hou&s;e, where People anti|ent, $word$ and pa&s;t Labour, might perhaps be found; for it is ob&s;ervable, that the People here, however laborious, generally live to a great Age, a certain Te&s;timony to the goodne&s;s and whole|&s;omne&s;s of the Country, which is, with|out doubt, as healthy as any Part of Eng|land; nor is the health of the People le&s;|&s;en'd,

but help'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd by them being con&s;tantly employ'd, and, as we call it, their working hard; &s;o that they find a double Advantage by their being always in Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>This Bu&s;ine&s;s is the Clothing Trade, for the Convenience of which the Hou&s;es are thus $$attered and &s;pread upon the &s;ides of the Hills, as above, even from the Bottom to the $op: $he Rea&s;on is this; &s;uch has been the Bounty of Na|ture to this otherwi&s;e frightful Country, that two Things e&s;&s;ential to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as to the Ea&s;e of the People are found here, and that in a &s;ituation which I never &s;aw the like of in any part of England; and, I believe, the like is not to be &s;een &s;o contrived in an Part of the World; I mean Coals, and running Wa|ter upon the Tops of the highe&s;t Hills: This &s;eems to have been directed by the wi&s;e Hand of Providence for the very Purpo&s;e which is now &s;erved by it, namely, the Manufactures, which other|wi&s;e could nor be carried on; neither in|deed could one fifth Part of the Inhabi|tants be &s;upported without them, for the Land could not maintain them. Af|ter we had mounted the third Hill, we found the Country, in &s;hort, one con|tinued Village, tho' mountainous every way, as before; hardly a Hou&s;e &s;tand|ing out of a &s;peaking di&s;tance from one another, and (which &s;oon told us their Bu&s;ine&s;s) the Day clearing up, and the Sun &s;hining, we could &s;ee that at almo&s;t at every Hou&s;e there was a Ten$er&punc; and almo&s;t on every Tenter a Piece of Cloth, or Ker&s;ie, or Shalloon, for they are three Articles of that Country's Labour; from which the Sun glancing, and as I may &s;ay, &s;hining (the White reflecting its Rays) to us, I thought it was the mo&s;t agreeable Sight that I ever &s;aw, for the Hills, as I &s;ay, $span$ &s;o thick, and the Vallies $span$ way, &s;ometim$ $span$ times we $span$ this Way, $span$ like $he $span$ called the Seven Dials; we could $word$ through the Glades almo&s;t every $word$ round us, yet look which Way we $word$ high to the Tops, and low to the $word$ it was all the &s;ame; innumerable $word$ and Tenters, and a white Piece upon $word$ Tenter.</P>
<P>But to return to the Rea&s;on $word$ per&s;ing the Hou&s;es, as above; I $span$ as our Road pa&s;s'd among them, $span$ deed no Road could do otherwi$e $span$ ever we pa&s;s'd any Hou&s;e we $span$ little Rill or Gutter of running $span$ if the Hou&s;e was above the $span$ came from it, and cro&s;s'd the $span$ run to another; if the Hou&s;e $span$ low us $t cro&s;s'd from &s;ome $span$ &s;tant Hou&s;e above it, and at every $span$ Hou&s;e was a $span$ Work-hou&s;e, and as they could $span$ their Bu&s;ine&s;s without Water, the $span$ S$$eams were &s;o pa$ted and $span$ Gu$$$rs or Pipes, and by $span$ dividing the Streams, that none $span$ Hou&s;es were without a River, $span$ call it &s;o, running into and through $word$ Work hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Again, as the Dying hou&s;$s, $word$ &s;hops, and Places where they $span$ Water, emitted the Water $span$ with the Drugs of the Dy$$g $span$ with the Oil, the Soap the $span$ other Ingredients u&s;ed by the $span$ in Dre&s;&s;ing and Scouring $span$ then runs away thro' the $span$ next, the Ground$ a$e not $span$ watered, how d$y $span$ but that Water $span$ &s;aten'd curiches the $span$ through, that 'tis hardly $o $span$ had fertile and $span$ by it.</P>

Manufacturer generally keeps a Cow or two, or more, for his Family, and this employs the two, or three, or four Pieces of enclo&s;ed Land about his Hou&s;e, for they &s;carce &s;ow Corn enough for their Cocks and Hens; and this feeding their Grounds &s;till adds by the Dung of the Cattle to enrich the Soil.</P>
<P>But now, to &s;peak of the Bounty of Nature again, which I but ju&s;t mention|ed; it is to be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e Hills are &s;o furni&s;hed by Nature with Springs and Mines, that not only on the Sides, but even to the very Tops, there is &s;$arce a Hill but you find, on the high|e&s;t Part of it, a Spring of Water, and a Coal-Pit. I doubt not but there are both Springs and Coal-Pits lower in the Hills, '$s enough to &s;ay they are at the top; but, as I &s;ay, the Hills are &s;o full of Springs, &s;o the lower Coal-Pits may per|haps be too full of Water, to work with|out Dreins to carry it off, and the Coals in the upper Pits being ea&s;ie to come at, they may chu&s;e to work them, becau&s;e the Hor&s;es which fetch the Coals, go $ight up the Hill, and come loaden down.</P>
<P>Having thus Fire and Water at every Dwelling, there is no need to enquire why they dwell thus di&s;pers'd upon the highe&s;t Hills, the Convenience of the Manufacturers requiring it. Among the Manufacturers Hou&s;es are likewi&s;e &s;cattered an infinite Number of Cottages or &s;mall Dwellings, in which dwell the Workmen which are employed, the Wo|men and Children of whom, are always bu&s;y Carding, Spinning, &amp;c. &s;o that no $ands being unemploy'd all can get their Bread, even from the younge&s;t to the an|tient; hardly any thing above four Years old, but its hands are &s;ufficient to its &s;elf.</P>
<P>This is the Rea&s;on al&s;o why we &s;aw $word$ few People without Doors; but if we $nock'd at the Door of any of the Ma|ter Manufacturers, we pre&s;ently &s;aw a Hou&s;e full of lu&s;ty Fellows, &s;ome at the $ye &s;at, &s;ome one thing, &s;ome another, all hard at Work, and full employed upon the Manufacture, and all &s;eeming to have &s;ufficient Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have dwelt &s;o upon this Part, if there was not abundance of Things &s;ub&s;equent to it, which will be explained in this one De&s;cription, and which are needful to be under&s;tood by any one that de&s;ires a full under&s;tanding of the Manner how the People of England are employed, and do &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the&s;e re|moter Parts where they are &s;o numerous; for this is one of the mo&s;t populous Parts of Britain, London and the adjacent Parts excepted.</P>
<P>Having thus de&s;cribed the Country, and the Employment of the People, I am to tell you, that this Part of it which I mentioned, is all belonging to and in the Pari&s;h of Hallifax, and that brings me on towards the Town which I &s;hall &s;peak of pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t only &s;ay a Word or two of the River Calder, to compleate the De|&s;cription ef the Country I thus pa&s;s'd through. I hinted to you, that all the Rills or Brooks of Water which we cro&s;s'd, one at lea&s;t in every Bottom, went away to the Left or North Side of us as we went forward Ea&s;t: I am to add, that following tho&s;e little Brooks with our Eye, we could ob&s;erve, that at &s;ome di&s;tance to the Left there appeared a larger Valley than the re&s;t, into which not only all the Brooks which we pa&s;s'd emptied them&s;elves, but abundance more from the like hollow deep Bottoms, among the Hills on the North Side of it, which emptied this way South, as tho&s;e on our Side run that way North; &s;o that it was natural to conclude, that in this larger Valley the Waters of all tho&s;e Brooks joining, there mu&s;t be &s;ome pretty large &s;tream which received them all, and ran forward Ea&s;t, parallel to the way we were in.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time we found that great Opening &s;eemed to bind Southward towards us, and that probably it would cro&s;s our Road, or our Road would rather cro&s;s
<PB REF="382">
the Valley; and &s;o it was naturl to ex|pect we &s;hould pa&s;s that larger Water, either by a Bridge or a Ford; but we were &s;oon convinced it was not the lat|ter; for the Snow, as is &s;aid, having pour|ed down a Quantity of Water, we &s;oon found at the next Opening, that there was a con&s;iderable River in the larger Valley, which, having received all tho&s;e little Brooks, was ri&s;en to a little Flood; and at the next Village we pa&s;s'd it over a &s;tately Stone Bridge of &s;everal great Arches. This Village is called So$by or Sowreby; and this was the main River Calder, which I mentioned at $word$ where it begins to be Navigable, and which, without any Spring o$ Fountain, to be called the Head or Source of it, is formed on the Declivity of the&s;e Moun|tains, meerly by the continued fall of Rains and Snows, which the &s;aid Moun|tains intercepting the Clouds, are &s;eldom free from; and this Stream receiving the &s;maller Gulls and Hollows, I ju&s;t now mentioned, like a Common-&s;hore, carries all away in the Channel of a noble Ri|ver.</P>
<P>This is the beginning of the Calder; and my Rea&s;on for dwelling upon it, and giving &s;o particular a De&s;cription, is, be|cau&s;e this may, once for all, &s;hew you how all, or mo&s;t of the great Rivers in the North, take their Ri&s;e, there being hardly any that has their beginning in any Publick Springs or Lakes, as mo&s;t of the Rivers in the South of England have, as the Thames, for example, near Tring in Hertford&s;hire, the Vandal at Croydon and Ca&s;halton, the Amewell at Ware, and the like.</P>
<P>As the Calder is thus nothing but a Collection of Water from the fall of the&s;e Mountains, &s;o was the Derwent, and the Don, from the High Peak, and the Hills of the &s;ame Range more South of the Edge, and &s;o is the Aire, the Wharf, the Swa$e, the Eure, the Nid, the Tees, and the Were, all in the &s;ame County of York; and &s;o the Tyne, the Cockett, the Till, and the Tweed, farther North; and even the like of the Forth, the Tay, the Clyde, the Nyd, in $span$ the Mer&s;ee, the Riddle, the $span$ the Lune, the We&s;t Calder, $span$ and the Eden, on the other $span$ Mountains, in Lanca&s;hire, $span$ and Cumberland And thus $span$ will &s;erve for all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Having thus, I &s;ay, accounted $span$ all at once; I &s;hall only $span$ now as they come in my way $span$ will ob&s;erve, I cro&s;s'd one $span$ them at every con&s;ider $span$ all the Rivers as $span$ Scotland, North of $span$ the middle of the $span$ Mountains ri&s;e, either $span$ man, or We&s;t into the $span$ of them run like the $span$ or the Rivers in South Wales, $span$ in Devon, or the Av$n in $span$ Arun in Su&s;&s;ex, and others $span$ South. But I return to the North.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the Calder $span$ Bridge, I now began to approach $span$ Town of Hallifax; in the $span$ which, and its Dependencies, all my Ac|count of the Commerce will $span$ for take Hallifax, with all its Depen|dencies, it is not to be equalled $span$ Fir&s;t, the Pari&s;h or Vicaridge, $word$ it is but a Vicaridge; is, if not the larg|e&s;t, certainly is the mo&s;t popul$us in England; in &s;hort, it is a Mon&s;ter, I mean, for a Country Pari&s;h, and $span$ &s;o far out of the way of foreign $word$ Courts, or Sea Ports</P>
<P>The extent of the Pari&s;h, they tell us, is almo&s;t Circular, and is about twelve Miles in Diameter. There are $span$ or thirteen Chapels of Ea&s;e, be&s;ides about &s;ixteen Meeting-Hou&s;es, which they $word$ al&s;o Chapels, and are $o, having Bells to call the People, and Burying Grounds to mo&s;t of them or el&s;e they bury with $ them. I think they told me, the Q$$|kers Meetings, of which there are &s;everal that are not reckoned into the Number. In a word, it is &s;ome Years ago that a Reverend Clergyman of the Town of Hallifax, told me, they reckoned that
<PB REF="383">
they had a Hundred thou&s;and Commu|nicants in the Pari&s;h be&s;ides Children.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory tells us al&s;o, that in Queen Elizabeth's Time, when the Inhabitants of Hallifax addre&s;&s;ed the Queen for &s;ome Privileges, which I do not a pre&s;ent re|member the Particulars of, it was expre&s;|&s;ed in the Petition as a moving Argument, why the Queen &s;hould take them into $word$ Royal Care, that they were zealous Prote&s;tants, and were &s;o loyal to her Ma|j$$y a$ well as &s;o con&s;iderable, that no $word$ than twelve thou&s;and young Men w$nt out arm'd from this one Pari&s;h, and, at her Maje&s;ty's call, joined her Troops to fight the Popi&s;h Army, then the $word$ under the Earl of We&s;tmor|land.</P>
<P>I$ they were &s;o populous at that time&punc; how much mu&s;t they be encrea&s;ed &s;ince? and e&s;pecially &s;ince the late Revolution, the Trade having been prodigiou&s;ly en|couraged and encrea&s;ed by the great De|mand of their Ker&s;ies for clothing the Armies abroad, in&s;omuch that it is the Opinion of &s;ome that know the Town, and its Bounds very well, that the Num|ber of People in the Vicaridge of Halli|fax&punc; is encrea&s;ed one fourth, at lea&s;t, with|in the la&s;t forty Years, that is to &s;ay, &s;ince the late Revolution. Nor is it im|probable at all, for be&s;ides the Number of Hou&s;es which are encrea&s;ed, they have entered upon a new Manufacture which was never made in tho&s;e Parts before, at lea&s;t, not in any Quantities, I mean, the Manufactures of Shalloons, of which they now make, if Fame does not bely them a hundred thou&s;and P$$ces a Year in this Pari&s;h only, and yet do not make $$ch $$wer Ker&s;ies than they did $word$.</P>
<P>The Trade in Ker&s;ies al&s;o was &s;o great, $word$ I was told by very creditable, hone&s;t $word$ when I was there, Men not given $span$ or Boa&s;ting, and le&s;s to $word$ that there was one Dealer in the $word$ who traded, by Commi&s;&s;ion, Three&s;core thou&s;and Pounds a Year $word$ only, and all that to Holland $span$.</P>
<P>But not to enter into Particulars, it is evident, that the Trade mu&s;t be exceeding great, in that it employs &s;uch a very great Number of People, and that, in this one Town only; for, as I &s;hall fully de&s;cribe in my Account of other Places, this is not what I may call the elde&s;t Son of the Cloathing Trade in this County; the Town of Leeds challenges a Preemin|ence, and, I believe&punc; merits the Dignity it claims, be&s;ides the Towns of Huthers|field, Bradforth, Wakefield, and others.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not leave Hlalifax yet, as the Vicaridge is thus far extended, and the extent of it &s;o peopled, what mu&s;t the Market be, and where mu&s;t this va&s;t Number o$ People be &s;upplied For, (1.) As to Corn, I have ob&s;erved already, they &s;ow little and hardly enough to feed their Poultry, if they were to be Corn fed; and as to Beef and Mutton, they feed little or none; and as they are &s;urrounded with latge, populous, Manufacturing Towns on every Side, all of them em|ployed as the&s;e are, in the Cloathing Trade, they mu&s;t then nece&s;&s;arily have their Provi&s;ions from other Parts of the Country.</P>
<P>This then is a Sub&s;i&s;tence to the other Parts of the Country, and &s;o it is for us, the We&s;t Riding is thus taken up, and the Lands occupied by the Manufacture; the Con&s;equence is plain, their Corn comes up in great Quantities out of Lincoln, Nottingham, and the Ea&s;t Riding, their Black Cattle and Hor&s;es from the North Riding, their Sheep and Mutton from the adjacent Counties every way, their But|ter from the Ea&s;t and North Riding, their Chee&s;e out of &punc;Che&s;hire and Warwick|&s;hire, more Black Cattle al&s;o from Lanca|&s;hire. And here the Breeders and Feeders, the Farmers and Country People find Mo|ney flowing in plenty from the Manu|facturers and Commerce; &s;o that at Hal|lifax, $word$ and the other great manu|facturing Towns &s;o often mentioned, and adjacent to the&s;e for the two Months of September and October, a prodigious Quantity of Black Cattle is &s;old.</P>
<P><PB REF="384">
This Demand for Beef is occa&s;ioned thus; the u&s;age of the People is to buy in that Sea&s;on Beef &s;ufficient for that whole Year, which they kill and &s;alt, and hang up in the Smoke to dry. This way of curing their Beef keeps it all the Winter, and they eat this &s;moak'd Beef as a very great Rarity</P>
<P>Upon this foot, 'tis ordinary for a Clothier that has a large Family, to come to Hallifax on a Market-Day, and buy two or three large Bullocks from eight to ten Pounds a-piece. The&s;e he carries home and kills for his Store. And this is the Rea&s;on that the Markets at all tho&s;e Times of the Year are thronged with Black Cattle, as Smithfield is on a Friday; whereas all the re&s;t of the Year there is little extraordinary &s;old there.</P>
<P>Thus this one trading, manufacturing Part of the Country &s;upports all the Countries round it, and the Numbers of People &s;ettle here as Bees about a Hive.</P>
<P>As for the Town of Hallifax it &s;elf, there is nothing extraordinary except on a Market Day, and then indeed it is a prodigious Thing, by rea&s;on of the Mul|titude of People who throng thither, as well to &s;ell their Manufactures as to buy Provi&s;ions; and &s;o great is the Conflu|ence of People hither, that except Leeds and Wakefield, nothing in all the North Part of England can come near it.</P>
<P>The Church is old, but &s;tately and venerable, and has in it many extraor|dinary Monuments, but mo&s;t of them of great Antiquity. Here is a very good Ho&s;pital, and a Work hou&s;e of an ancient E&s;tabli&s;hment, a$d there are &s;everal Cha|rities, of like &s;ort, in other Parts of the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not quit Hallifax, till I give you &s;ome Account of the famous Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice anciently executed here, to prevent the &s;tealing of Cloth. Mo|dern Accounts pretend to &s;ay, it was for all &s;orts of Felons; but I am well a&s;|&s;ured, it was fir&s;t erected purely, or at lea&s;t principally, for &s;uch Thieves as were apprehended &s;tealing Cloth from the Tent|ers; and it &s;eems very rea&s;onable to $word$ it was &s;o becau&s;e of the Conditions of the Trial. The Ca&s;e was thus:</P>
<P>The erecting the Woollen Manufacture here was about the Year 148$, when $word$ Henry VII. by giving Encouragement to Foreigners to &s;ettle in England, and to &s;et up Woollen Manufacture$, cau&s;ed an Act to pa&s;s prohibiting the Exporta$$ $word$ of Wool into foreign Parts, unwrought, and to encourage foreign Manufacturers to come and &s;ettle here, of whom &s;eve|ral coming over &s;ettled the Manufactures of Cloths in &s;everal Parts of the $word$ as they found the People $word$ and as the Country be&s;t $word$ $word$ as the Bays at Colche&s;ter, the Says at Sudbury, the Broad Cloth in Wilts&punc; and other Counties; &s;o the trade of $span$ and narrow Cloth fixed at this Place, $word$ other adjacent Towns.</P>
<P>When this Trade began to &s;ettle, no|thing was more frequent than for y$$$g Workmen to leave their Cloths ou$ a$ Night upon the Tenters, and the $word$ Fellows would come in upon them, and tearing them off without notice, &s;teal the Cloth. Now as it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry to pre&s;erve the Trade in its Infancy, this &s;evere Law was made, giving $word$ Power of Life and Death &s;o $word$ $word$ $word$ hands of the Magi&s;trates of Hallifax $s to &s;ee the Law executed upon them. As this Law was particularly pointed $word$ $word$ the &s;tealing of Cloth, and no other $word$ &s;o no others were capable of being $word$ by it, and the Conditions of $span$ intimate as much; for th Power was not given to the Magi&s;trates to give $$$|tence, unle&s;s in one of the&s;e three pla$$ Ca&s;es:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hand Napping,</HI> that is, to be t$+ken in the very Fact, or, as the $word$ call it in the Ca&s;e of Murth$$, <HI>R$-Hand.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Back Bearing,</HI> that is, when the Cloth was found on the Per&s;on carrying it off.</P>
<P N="3"><PB REF="385">
3 <HI>Tongue Confe&s;&s;ing,</HI> that part needs no farther Explanation.</P>
<P>This being the Ca&s;e, if the Criminal $ws taken, he was brought before the Magi&s;trates of the Town, who at that time were only a <HI>Baily</HI> and the <HI>Eoalder|men,</HI> how many we do not read, and the&s;e were to judge, and &s;entence, and execute the Offender, or clear him, with|in to many Days; I think it was three Market Days if the Offence was com|m $ted out of the Vicarage, but within the Bounds of the Fore&s;t then there were <HI>Frith Borges</HI> al&s;o to judge of the Fact, who were to be &s;ummoned of the <HI>Fore&s;t H$lders,</HI> as they are called, who were to hold of that Frith, that is, of the Fore&s;t; but tho&s;e were to be good and $word$ Men, and by the Magi&s;trates of the Town to be approved as &s;uch; if tho&s;e $$quitted him of the Fact he was im|mediately di&s;charged; if tho&s;e cen&s;ured $word$ no Body could reprieve him but the $own. The Country People were, it $ms, &s;o terrified at the &s;everity of this $roceeding, that hence came that Pro|$b$$l Saving, which was u&s;ed all over $rk&s;hire, viz.
<Q><L>From Hell, Hull, and Hallifax,</L>
<L>Good Lord, delived us,</L></Q></P>
<P>How Hull came to be included in this $word$ I do not find; for they had no $word$ I aw there, as I read of.</P>
<P>The manner of Execution was very $rkable; the Engine indeed is carried $, but the Scaffold on which it &s;tood $ere to this Time, and may $word$ many Ages; being not a Frame $ood but a &s;quare Building of Stone, &s;tone Steps to go up, and the $word$ it &s;elf was made in the following er.</P>
<P>ey tell us of a Cu&s;tom which $word$ here, in the Ca&s;e of a Criminal to be executed, viz. that if after ead was laid down, and the sig|$e$ to pull out the Pin, he could be &s;o nimble as to &s;natch out his $word$ between the pulling out the Pin and the falling down of the Axe, and could get up upon his Feet, jump off of the Scaffold, run down a Hill that lies ju&s;t before it, and get through the River be|fore the Executioner could overtake him, and &s;eize upon him, he was to e&s;cape; and though the Executioner d$d take him on the other Side the River, he was not to bring him back, at lea&s;t he was not to be executed.</P>
<P>But as they &s;hewed me the form of the Scaffold, and the weight of the Axe, it was, in my Opinion, next to impo&s;&s;i|ble, any Man &s;hould be &s;o quick eyed as to &s;ee the pulling out the Piu, and &s;o quick with his Head, as to &s;natch it out; yet they tell a Story of one Fel|low that did it, and was &s;o bold afte$ he had jumpt off of the Scaffold, and was running down the Hill, with the Executioner at his Heel, to turn about aud call to the People to give him his Hat; that having afterwards jumpt into the River, which is but a little one, and not deep, he &s;topt, intending to drown the Hangman, if he had come up to him; at which the poor Fellow &s;topt too, and was afraid to go into the Water to &s;eize him. But this Story is &s;aid to be too long ago to have any Vouchers, though the People indeed all receive it for Truth.</P>
<P>The force of this Engine is &s;o &s;trong, the Head of the Axe being loaded with a weight of Lead to make it fall heavy, and the Execution is &s;o &s;ure, that it takes away all po&s;&s;ibility of its failing to cut off the Head; and to this Purpo&s;e, the Hallifax People tell you another Story of a Country Woman, who was riding by upon her Do&s;&s;ers or Hampers to Hal|lifax Market&punc; for the Execution was al|ways on a Market Day (the third after the Fact) and pa&s;&s;ing ju&s;t as the Axe was let fall upon the Neck of the Crimi|minal, it chopt it thro' with &s;nch Force,
<PB REF="386">
that the Head jumpt off into one of her Hampers, and the Woman not perceiving it, &s;he carry'd it away to the Market.</P>
<P>All the u&s;e I &s;hall make of this unlike|ly Story, is this, that it &s;eems Evecuti|ous were &s;o frequent, that it was not thought a Sight worth the Peoples run|ning out to &s;ee; that the Woman &s;hould ride along &s;o clo&s;e to the Scaffold, and that &s;he &s;hould go on, and not &s;o much as &s;top to &s;ee the Axe fall, or take any notice of it. But tho&s;e Difficulties &s;eem to be much better &s;olved, by &s;aying, that 'tis as rea&s;onable to think the whole Tale is a little York&s;hire, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, you will under&s;tand well enough.</P>
<P>This Engine was removed, as we are told, in the Year 1620, during the Reign of King James the Fir&s;t, and the U&s;age and Cu&s;tom of Pro&s;ecution aboli&s;hed, and Criminals or Felons left to the ordinary Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice, as it is &s;till; and yet they do not find the &s;tealing Cloth from the Tenters is &s;o frequent now as it was in tho&s;e Times.</P>
<P>But the manner of Execution is pre|&s;erv'd; for in the Reign of the &s;ame Prince, the Earl Morton, Regent or Prime Mini&s;ter of Scotland, under King James, pa&s;&s;ing thro' Hallifax, and &s;eeing one of their Executions, was &s;o plea&s;ed with the Performance, that he cau&s;ed a Model to be taken and c rried into Scotland, where it is pre&s;erved and con&s;tantly made u&s;e of for Executions to this Day. But one Thing $u&s;t not be forgotten in this part of the Story, namely, that his Lord|&s;hip's own Head was the fir&s;t that was cut off with it; and it being many Years before that happened, the Engine was called the Maiden, as not having &s;o long hand$ell'd, and &s;till retains the Name, tho' it has cut off many a Head &s;ince that.</P>
<P>We quitted Hallifax not without &s;ome A&s;toni&s;hment at its Situation, being &s;o &s;urrounded with Hills, and tho&s;e &s;o high, as (except the Entrance by the We&s;t) makes the coming in and going out of it exceeding trouble&s;ome, and indeed for Carriages hardly practicable, and parti|cularly the Hill which they go up $word$ come out of the Town Ea&s;twards $word$ wards Leeds, and which the Country People call Hallifax Bank, is &s;o &s;le$p$ $word$ rugged, and &s;ometimes too &s;o $word$ that, to a Town of &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s $word$ this is, 'tis exceeding trouble&s;ome $word$ dangerous.</P>
<P>From Hallifax it is twelve M$les to Leeds North Ea&s;t, and about $span$ Wakefield; due Ea&s;t, or a little $span$ between Hallifax and Leeds $span$ Town called Bur&s;tall. Here t e $span$ and Salloon Trade being, a it were, confined to Hallifax, and the Towns al|ready named, of Hutherfield $$nd Brad|forth, they begin to make Broad Cloth$ I call it Broad, in di&s;tinction from $e$$ies and Druggets, and &s;uch Things, $span$ the Cloths in this Country are $word$ Narrow, when they are &s;poken of $word$ London, and compared with the Broad Cloths made in Wilts, Glouce&s;ter, S$m$$|&s;et and Devon&s;hire, of which I have $word$ in former Letters.</P>
<P>This Town is famed for Dying, and they make a Sort of Cloths here $span$ of the Glouce&s;ter White Cloths bought for the Dutch and the $word$ Trades; and though their Cloths here may not be as fine, they told us th$$ Colours are as good But that is $word$ my Bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;pute, the We&s;t Country Clothiers deny it; and &s;o I leave $word$ I find it.</P>
<P>From hence to Leeds, and every $word$ to the Right-hand and the Left, the $word$ appears bu&s;y, diligent, and even $word$ hurry of Work, they are not $span$ and di&s;per&s;ed as in the Vica idge of Hal|lifax, where the Hou&s;es &s;tand $word$ by one; but in Villages, tho&s;e Villages large$ full of Hou&s;es, and tho&s;e Hou&s;es $word$ with People, for the whole Country is infinitely populous.</P>
<P>A noble Scene of Indu&s;try and $word$ is &s;pread before you h$$e, and which, joined to the Market at $word$ where it chiefly centers, is &s;u h a $word$ thing, that they who have pre$$nded
<PB REF="387">
to give an Account of York&s;hire, and $ave left this out, mu&s;t betray an Ignor|ance not to be accounted for, or excu&s;ed; us what is well worth the Curio&s;ity of a Stranger to go on purpo&s;e to &s;ee; and and many Travellers and Gentlemen have come over from Hamburgh, nay, even from Leip&s;ick in Saxony, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>And this bro&uuml;ght me from the Vil|lages where this Manufacture is wrought, to the Market where it is &s;old, which is at Leeds.</P>
<P>Leeds is a large, wealthy and populous Town, it &s;tands on the North Bank of the River Aire, or rather on both Sides the River, for there is a large Suburb or Part of the Town on the South Side of the River, and the whole is joined by a &s;tately and prodigiou&s;ly &s;trong Stone Bridge, &s;o large, and &s;o wide, that for|merly the Cloth Market was kept in neit$er Part of the Town, but on the very Bridge it &s;elf; and therefore the Re|fre&s;hment given the Clothiers by the Inn|keepers, of which I &s;hall &s;peak pre&s;ently, is called the Brigg &s;hot to this Day.</P>
<P>The Encrea&s;e of the Manufacturers and of the Trade, &s;oon made the Market too great to be confined to the Brigg or Bridge, and it is now kept in the High|&s;treet, beginning from the Bridge, and $word$ up North almo&s;t to the Market-Hou$$&punc; where the ordinary Market for Pro$ &s;ions begins, which al&s;o is the great|e&s;t of its kind in all the North of Eng|land&punc; except Hallifex, of which I have $poken already, &s;tay, the People a$ Leeds will not allow me to except Hallifex, but $y&punc; that theirs is the greate&s;t Market, $word$ that $ot the greate&s;t Plenty only, $word$ the be&s;t of all Kinds of Provi&s;ions $word$ $$ought hither</P>
<P>$word$ th$$ is not the Ca&s;e; it is the Cloth $span$ now to de&s;cribe, which is $word$ a Prodigy of its Kind, and is not $word$ $q$alled in the World. The $word$ S$rges at Exeter is indeed a $word$ Thing, and the Value &s;old there is $word$ but then the Market there is but once a Week, here it is twice a Week, and the Quantity of Goods va&s;t|ly great too.</P>
<P>The Market it &s;elf is worth de&s;cribing, tho' no De&s;cription can come up to the Thing it &s;elf; however, take a Sketch of it with its Cu&s;toms and U&s;ages as fol|lows:</P>
<P>The Street is a large, broad, fair and well-built$ Street, beginning, as I have &s;aid, at the Bridge, and a&s;cending gently to the North&punc;</P>
<P>Early in the Morning, there are Tre&s;|&s;els placed in two Rows in the Street&punc; &s;ometimes two Rows on a Side, but al|ways one Row at lea&s;t; then there are Boards laid cro&s;s tho&s;e Tre&s;&s;els, &s;o that the Boards lie like long Counters on ei|ther Side, from one end of the Street to the other.</P>
<P>The Clothiers come early in the Morn|ing with their Cloth; and as few Clothi|ers bring more than one Piece, the Mar|ket being &s;o frequent, they go into the Inns and Publick Hou&s;es with it, and there &s;et it down.</P>
<P>At &s;even a Clock in the Morning, the Clothiers being &s;uppo&s;ed to be all come by that time, even in the Winter, but the Hour is varried as the Sea&s;ons advance (in the Summer earlier, in the Depth of Winter a li tle later) I take it, at a Medi|um, and as it was when I was there, at &s;ix or &s;even, I &s;ay, the Market Bell rings&punc; it would &s;urprize a Stranger to &s;ee in how few Minutes, without hurry or noi&s;e, and not in the lea&s;t di&s;order, the whole Mar|ket is fill'd; all the Boards upon the Tre&s;&s;els are covered with Cloth, clo&s;e to one another as the Pieces can lie long ways by one another, and behind every Piece of Cloth, the Clothier &s;tanding to &s;ell it.</P>
<P>This indeed is not &s;o difficult, when we con&s;ider that the whole Quantity is brought into the Market as &s;oon as one Piece, becau&s;e as the Clothiers &s;tand rea|dy in the Inns and Shops ju&s;t behind&punc; and that there is a Clothier to every Piece&punc; they have no more to do but $word$ a
<PB REF="388">
Regiment drawn up in Line, every one takes up his Piece, and has about five &s;teps to march to lay it upon the fir&s;t Row of Boards, and perhaps ten to the &s;econd Row; &s;o that upon the Market Bell ringing, in half a quarter of an Hour the whole Market is fill'd, the Rows of Boards cover'd, and the Clothiers &s;tand ready.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Bell has done Ring|ing, the Merchants and Factors, and Buy|ers of all Sorts, come down, and com|ing along the Spaces between the Rows of Boards, they walk up the Rows, and down as their Occa&s;ions direct. Some of them have their foreign Letters of Orders, with Patterns &s;eal'd on them, in Rows, in their Hands; and with tho&s;e they match Colours, holding them to the Cloths as they think they agree to: When they &s;ee any Cloths to their Co|lours&punc; or that &s;uit their Occa&s;ions, they reach over to the Clothier and whi&s;per, and in the fewe&s;t Words imaginable the Price is &s;tated; one asks, the other bids; and 'tis agree, or not agree, in a mo|ment.</P>
<P>The Merchants and Buyers generally walk down and up twice on each Side of the Rows, and in little more than an Hour all the Bu&s;ine&s;s is done; in le&s;s than half an Hour you will pereeive the Cloths begin to move off, the Clothier $aking it up upon his Shoulder to carry it to the Merchant's Hou&s;e; and by half an hour after eight a Clock the Market Bell rings again; immediately the Buyers di&s;|appear, the Cloth is all &s;old, or if here and there a Piece happens not to be bought, '$is carried back into the Inn, and, in a quarter of an Hour, there is not a Peice of Cloth to be &s;een in the Market.</P>
<P>Thus, you &s;ee, Ten or Twenty thou|&s;and Pounds value in Cloth, and &s;ome|times much more, bought and &s;old in little more than an Hour, and the Laws of the Market the mo&s;t &s;trictly ob&s;erved as ever I &s;aw done in any Market in Eng|land; for,</P>
<P N="1">1. Before the Market Bell rings, no Man &s;hews a Piece of Cloth, nor can the Clotheirs &s;ell any but in open Mar|ket.</P>
<P N="2">2. After the Market Bell rings again, no Body &s;tays a Moment in the Market, but carried his Cloth back if it be not &s;old.</P>
<P N="3">3. And that which is mo&s;t admirable is, 'tis all managed with the mo&s;t pro|found Silence, and you cannot hear a Word &s;poken in the whole Market, I mean, by the Per&s;ons buying and &s;elling; 'tis all done in whi&s;per.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of this Silence, is chiefly becau&s;e the Clothiers &s;tand &s;o near to one another; and 'tis always rea&s;onable that one &s;hould not know what another does, for that would be di&s;covering their Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and expo&s;ing it to one another.</P>
<P>If a Merchant has bidden a Clothier a Price, and he will not take it, he may go after him to his Hou&s;e, and tell him he has con&s;idered of it, and is willing to let him have it; but they are not to make any new Agreement for it, &s;o as to remove the Market from the Street to the Merchants Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>By nine a Clock the Boards are ta|ken down, the Tre&s;&s;els are removed, and the Street cleared, &s;o that you &s;ee no Market or Goods any more than if there had been nothing to do; and this is done twice a Week.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould ask upon all this, where all the&s;e Go$ds, as well here as at Wa$$|field, and at Hallifax, are vented and di&s;|po&s;ed of? It would require a long Trea|ti&s;e of Commerce to enter into that Part. But that I may not bring you into the Labyrinth, and not &s;how you the way out. I &s;hall, in three &s;hort Heads, $word$ the Con&s;umption, for there are three Chan|nels by which it goes:</P>
<P N="1">1. For the home Con&s;umption; their Goods being, as I may &s;ay, every where made u&s;e of, for the cloathing the or|dinary People, who cannot go to the Price of the fine Medley Cloaths made, as I formerly gave you an Account, in
<PB REF="389">
$e We&s;tern Counties of England. There $e for this purpo&s;e a Set of travelling Merchants in Leeds, who go all over $ngland with Droves $f Pack-Hor&s;es, and to all the Fairs and Market Towns over the whole I&s;land, I think I may &s;ay none excepted. Here they &s;upply not the common People by Retail, which would denominate them Pedlars indeed, $ut they &s;upply the Shops by Whole&s;ale or whole Peices; and not only &s;o, but $he large Credit too, &s;o that they are really travelling Merchants, and as &s;uch they &s;ell a very great Quantity of Goods; 'tis ordinary for one of the&s;e Men to car$y a thou&s;and Pounds value of Cloth with them at a time, and having &s;old it at the Fairs or Towns where they go&punc; they &s;end their Hor&s;es back for as much more, and th s very often in a Summer, for they chu&s;e to travel in the Summer, and perhaps towards the Winter time, tho' as $word$ in Winter as they can, becau&s;e of the $word$ of the Roads.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another &s;ort of Buyers are tho&s;e who buy to &s;end to London; either by Commi&s;&s;ions from London, or they give Commi&s;&s;ions to Factors and Warehou&s;e-keepers in London to &s;ell for them; and the$e drive al&s;o a very great Trade: The$e Factors and Warehou&s;e-keepers not only $upply all the Shop keepers Wh$l$&s;$le Men in London, but &s;ell al&s;o very $word$ Quantities to the Merchants, is $word$ for Exportation to the Engli&s;h $word$ in America which take off $word$ $word$ of tho&s;e cour&s;e Goods, $word$ New England, New York, $word$ $word$ as al&s;o to the Ru&s;&s;ia $word$ who &s;end and exceeding Quantity Petersburgh, R$ga, Dantzick, Narva, to Sweden and Pomerania.</P>
<P>The third &s;ort of Buyers, and who no$ le&s;s con&s;iderable than the other, truly Merchants, that is to &s;ay, &s;uch $eceive Commi&s;&s;ions from Abroad to Cloth for the Merchants in Ham|burgh, and in Holland, and from &s;everal other Par$s; and the&s;e are not only many in Number, but &s;ome of them are very con&s;iderable in their Dealings, and cor|re&s;pond as far as Nuremberg, Frankfort, Leip&s;ick, and even to Vienna and Aus|burgh, in the farthe&s;t Provinces of Ger|many.</P>
<P>On Account of this Trade it was, that &s;ome Years ago an Act of Parliament was obtained for making that Rivers Aire and Calder Navigable; by which a Communi|cation by Water was opened from Leeds and Wakefield to Hull, and by which means all the Woollen Manufactures which tho&s;e Merchants now export by Commi&s;|&s;ion, as above, is carried by Water to Hull, and there &s;hipped for Holland, Bre|men, Hamburgh, and the Baltick. And thus you have a brief Account, by what Methods this va&s;t Manufacture is carried off, and which way they find a Vent for it.</P>
<P>There is another Trade in this Part of the Country, which is now become very con&s;iderable &s;ince the opening the Navi|gation of the&s;e Rivers, and that is, that from hence they carry Coals down from Wakefield (e&s;pecially) and al&s;o from Leeds, at both which they have a very great Quantity, and &s;uch, as they told me, could never be exhau&s;ted. The&s;e they carry quite down into the Humber, and then up the Ou&s;e to York, and up the Trent, and other Rivers, where there are abundance of large Towns, who they &s;upply with Coals; with this Advantage too, that whereas the Newca&s;tle Coals pay four Shillings per Chaldron Duty to the Publick; the&s;e being only called Ri|ver Borne Coal, are exempted, and pay nothing; though, &s;trictly &s;peaking, they are carried on the Sea too, for the Hum|ber is properly the Sea. But they have been hitherto exempted from the Tax, and &s;o they carry on the Trade to their very great Profit and Advantage.</P>
<P><PB REF="390">
I need not add, that by the &s;ame Na|vigation they receive all their heavy Goods, as well &s;uch as are imported at Hull, as &s;uch as come from London, and &s;uch as other Counties &s;upply, as Butter, Chee&s;e, Lead, Iron, Salt; all Sorts of Grocery, as Sugars, Tobacco, Fruit, Spice, Hops, &amp;c. Oyl, Wine, Brandy, Spirits, and eve|ry Sort of heavy or bulky Goods,</P>
<P>The Town of Leeds is very large, and, as above, there are abundance of wealthy Merchants in it. Here are two Churches, and two large Meeting-Hou&s;es of Di&s;&s;enters, and &s;ix or &s;even Chapels of Ea&s;e, be&s;ides Di&s;&s;enters Chapels, in the adjacent, depending Villages; &s;o that Leeds may not be much inferior to Hal|lifax in Numbers of People: It is really a &s;urpri&s;ing Thing to &s;ee what Numbers of People are thronged together in all the Villages about the&s;e Towns, and how bu&s;y they all are, being fully employed in this great Manufacture.</P>
<P>Before I go forward from hence, I &s;hould tell you, that I took a little trip to &s;ee the antient Town of Pontefract, with that di&s;mal Place called the Ca&s;tle, a Place that was really di&s;mal on many Accounts, having been a Scene of Blood in many &s;evel Ages; for here Henry, the great Earl of Lanca&s;ter, who was at the &s;ame time Lord of the Ca&s;tle, and who&s;e Ance&s;tors had beautified and en|larged it exceedingly, and fortified it too, was beheaded, in King Edward the IId's time, with three or four more of the Engli&s;h Barons. Here Richard IId, be|ing depo&s;ed and impri&s;oned, was barba|roufly murthered, and, if Hi&s;tory lies not, in a cruel manner; and here Anthony, Earl Rivers, and Sir Richard Gray, the fir&s;t Uncle, and the la&s;t Brother in law to King Edward the Fifth, were beheaded by that Tyrant Richard III. Here, in the late Wars, a &s;mall Party of brave Fellows took the Ca&s;tle, by &s;urpri&s;e, for the King, and having de&s;perately defend|ed it to the la&s;t Extremity, and being o|bliged to yield, five of them attempted to break thro the Be&s;iegers Camp, three of whom peri&s;hed in the Attempt.</P>

comes down from the Hills al&s;o, as the re&s;t do.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t go back to Pontefract, to take notice, that here again the great Roman Highway, which I mentioned at Donca&s;ter, and which is vi&s;lble from thence in &s;everal Places on the Way to Ponte|fract, though not in the open Road, is apparent again, and from Ca&s;tleford Bridge, which is another Bridge over the united Rivers of Aire and Calder, it goes on to Abberforth, a &s;mall Market Town famous for Pin making, ane &s;o to Tadca&s;ter and York. But I mention it here on this pre|&s;ent Occa&s;ion, for otherwi&s;e the&s;e Re|mains of Antiquity are not my Province in this Undertaking; I &s;ay, 'tis on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. That in &s;ome Places this Cau&s;eway being cut into and broken up, the $word$ Care of the Romans for making firm Cau&s;eways for the Convenience of Car|a$$e, and for the pa&s;&s;ing of Travellers; is to be &s;een there. The Layings of dif|ferent Sorts of Earth, as Clay at the bot|tom. Chalk upon that, then Gravel upon the Chalk, then Stones upon the Gravel, and then Gravel again; and &s;o of other kinds of Earth, where the fir&s;t was not to be had.</P>
<P N="2">2. In &s;ome Places between this Bridge and Town of Abberforth, the Cau&s;eway having not be n u&s;ed for the ordinary $word$, it lies as fair and untouch'd, the Surf$ce cov$red with Turf, &s;mooth as at it$ fir&s;t making, not &s;o much as the Mark of a Hoof or a Wheel upon it; &s;o that it is to be &s;een in its full Dimen&s;ions and $word$ as if it had been made but the $word$ Week; whereas 'tis very probable $t had &s;tood &s;o fifteen or &s;ixteen hundred Y$ar$; and I take notice of it here, $word$ I have not &s;een any thing like it in any $$her Place in England, and becau&s;e $word$ People, who are now mending the Roads almo&s;t every where; might take a Pattern from it.</P>
<P>As I made this little Excur&s;ion to &s;ee the Town of Pontefract from Leeds, you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e me now retuned thither, and &s;etting out thence Northward. I had no &s;ooner pa&s;s'd out of the Di&s;trict of Leeds about four or five Miles, and pa&s;s'd the Whar&s;e&punc; at a fine Stone Bridge of eleven Arches, at a little pretty Town called Harwood; I &s;ay, I was no &s;ooner gotten hither, but it was ea&s;ie to &s;ee we were out of the Manufacturing Country. Now the black moori&s;h Lands, like Black-Barn&s;ley, &s;hew'd di&s;mal again and right|ful, the Towns# were thin, and thin of People too; we &s;aw but little enclo&s;ed Ground, no Tenters with the Cloths &s;hining upon them, nor People bu&s;ied within Doors, as before; but, as in the Vicaridge, we &s;aw inhabited Mountains, here we &s;aw wa&s;te and almo&s;t uninhabited Vales.</P>
<P>In a word, the Coun$ry look'd as i$ all the People were tran&s;planted to Leeds and Hallifax, and that here was only a few ju&s;t left at home to cultivate the Land, manage the Plough, and rai&s;e Corn for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The River Whar&s;e &s;eemed very &s;mall&punc; and the Water low, at Harwood Bridge&punc; &s;o that I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o fine a Bridge over it, and was thinking of the great Bridge $t Madrid over the Man&s;a|nares, of which a Frenchman of Quality looking on it, &s;aid to the Spaniards that were about him, That the King of Spain ought either to buy them &s;ome Water, or they &s;hould fell their Bridge: But I was afterwards &s;atisfied that was not the Ca&s;e here; for coming another time this Way after a heavy Rain, I was convinced the Bridge was not at all too big&punc; or too long, the Water filling up to the very Crown of the Arches, and &s;ome of the Arches not to be &s;een at all.</P>
<P>From the Wharfe we went directly North, over a continued wa&s;te of black, ill locking, de&s;olate Moors, over which Travellers are guided, like Race Hor&s;es&punc; by Po&s;ts &s;et up for fear of Bogs and Holes, to a Town call'd Ripley, that &s;tands up&punc;
<PB REF="392">
$word$ another River called the Nad by &s;ome, by others the Nyd&punc; &s;maller than the Wharfe, but furiou&s;ly rapid, and very dangerous to pa&s;s in many Places, e&s;peci|ally upon &s;udden Rains Notwith&s;tand|ing &s;uch lofty, high built Bridges as are not to be &s;een over &s;uch &s;mall Rivers in any other Place; and, on this Occa&s;ion, it may be ob&s;erved here, once for all, that no Part of England, I may &s;ay &s;o becau&s;e I can &s;ay I have &s;een the whole I&s;land, a very little excepted, I &s;ay, no Part can &s;hew &s;uch noble, lofty, and long Stone Bridges as this Part of England, nor &s;o many of them; nor do I remember to have &s;een any &s;uch thing as a Timber Bridge in all the Northern Part of England, no not from the Trent to the Tweed; whereas in the South Parts of England there are abundance, as particularly over the great River of Thames at King&s;ton. Chert&s;ey, Staines, Wind&s;or, Maidenhead, Reading, Henley, Marlow, and other Places, and over the River Lea, tho' a navigable River, of thirteen Bridges, we &s;ee $word$ one built of Stone, (viz.) that at Bow.</P>
<P>A little below Ripley, on the &s;ame River Nyd, and with a very fine Bridge over it al&s;o, we &s;aw Knaresborough; known among Foreigners by the Name of Knares|borough Spaw; in the South of England I have heard it call'd the York&s;hire Spaw. I &s;hall not enter here upon the definition of the Word Spaw, 'tis enough to &s;peak familiarly, that here is a Well of Phy&s;ical or Mineral Waters, or, to &s;peak more ex|actly as one viewing the Country, here are at the Town, and in the adjacent Lands, no le&s;s than four Spaws or Mine|ral Waters.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing recommended to me for a Wonder, was that four Spr ngs, the Waters of which are in them&s;elves of &s;o different a Quality, &s;hould ri&s;e in &s;o nar|row a compa&s;s of Ground; but I, who was &s;urfeited with County Wonders in my pa&s;&s;ing the Peak, was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;urprized at the wonderful &s;trangen&s;s of this Part; and when my Land&s;ord at Knaresborough took me &s;hort, with a <HI>But is it not a &s;trange thing, Sir?</HI> I an&s;wered him with a Que&s;tion, Is it not as &s;trange, Sir, &s;aid I, that in De$by&s;hir$ two Springs, one hot, and another $word$ &s;hould ri&s;e within a Hand's bread$h $word$ one another? 'Tis certain, that though the eruption of Water may be near, yet the &s;ubterranean Pa&s;&s;ages may be as re|mote as Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and the Miner$l lying in Veins may run remote al&s;o&punc; $word$ as to take off all the Wonder.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Springs them&s;elves, and $word$ one of them, is nothing extra$rdi$$$y, namely, that in a little Cave a $word$ Water drops from the Roof of the Ca|vity, which, as they &s;ay, turn&punc; $word$ Stone. This indeed I made light of $word$ becau&s;e I had already been at P$o$$'s Hole and Ca&s;tleton in the Peak, and $word$ Harwich.</P>
<P>But new to &s;peak of the other two Springs, they are indeed valuable Ra$|ties, and not to be equalled in Eng|land.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t is the Sweet Sp$w, or a Vi$riolick Water; it was d$&s;cover$d by one Mr. Slingsby, Anno 1630 and $word$ Phy&s;icians acknowledge is to be a very &s;overeign Medicine in &s;everal pa$tic$lar Di&s;tempers. <HI>Vid Dr. Leigh</HI>'s <HI>Nat. $word$ of Lanca&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Stinking Spaw, or, if you will according to the Learned, the $word$ Well. This Water is clear as $word$ but $oetid and nau&s;eous to the $word$ that tho&s;e who drink it are ob$$ed $word$ hold their No&s;es when they d$ink; y$$ it is a valuable medicine al&s;o in Scor$$|tic, Hypochondriac. and e&s;pecially in Hydropic Di&s;tempers; as to its curing the Gout, I take that, as in other Ca&s;es, <HI>$word$ referendum,</HI></P>
<P>The People formerly, and that for many Years, only drank the&s;e Waters&punc; and u&s;ed them no otherwi&s;e; but are now come into the U&s;e of bathing in them as a Cold Bath, and thus they mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be very good for Rheumatic Pains,
<PB REF="393">
Paraletic Numbne&s;&s;es, and many other Di&s;tempers which afflict Mankind.</P>
<P>We were &s;urpri&s;ed to find a great deal of good Company here drinking the Wa|ters, and indeed, more than we found afterwards at Scarborough; though this &s;eems to be a mo&s;t de&s;olute out of-the-way Place, and that Men would $word$ retire to it for religious Mortifications, and to hate the World, but we found it was quite otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Bridges at Harwood and Ripley are very firm, fine, and, I a&s;&s;ure you, very chargeable Work. It is true, a Bridge over the &s;ame River at Burrow|brigg, four Miles lower than Rippon, has but four or five Arches, but then tho&s;e Arches are near forty Foot diameter, and one of the middlemo&s;t much more, and high in proportion, and the ends of the Bridge continued by high Cau&s;eways, built of Stone, to keep the Water in its Cour&s;e; and yet &s;ometimes all is too lit|$le.</P>
<P>From the Bridges may be ob&s;erv'd, that however low the&s;e Waters are in the $ummer, they are high and furious enough $word$ the Winter; and yet the River Aire, $ho' its beginning is in the &s;ame Ridge of $ountains as the other, and particularly $word$ the Hill called Penigent, which over|$ps all its Neighbours; I &s;ay, this Ri|$r is gentle and mild in its Stream, when $e other are all raging and furious; the $$ly Rea&s;on I can give for it, which $wever I think is a very ju&s;t Account, $word$ that it runs in a thou&s;and Windings $word$ Turnings more than any other Ri|$$r in tho&s;e Parts; and the&s;e Reaches $word$ Meanders of the River greatly help check the &s;harpne&s;s of the Stream: The $word$ Rea&s;on is, that after it has de&s;cended $word$ the Mountains it has a deeper $word$ both which, I think&punc; put together, $word$ &s;ufficiently account for the abating $word$ Current.</P>
<P>Rippon is a very near, plea&s;ant, $word$ Town, and has not only an $word$ Situation on a ri&s;ing Ground be|tween two Rivers, but the Market Place is the fine&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful Square that is to be &s;een of its kind in Eng|land.</P>
<P>In the middle of it &s;tand a curious Column of Stone, imitating the Obeli&s;ks of the Ancients, tho' not &s;o high, but rather like the Pillar in the middle of Covent Garden, or that in Lincoln's Inn, with Dials al&s;o upon it.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not omit to tell you al&s;o, however other pretended travelling Writers were not to &s;ee it as they went by, that here is a large Collegiate Church, and tho' it is not a Bi&s;hoprick but a Deanary only, in the Dioce&s;s of York, yet it is a very hand&s;ome, ancient and venerable Pile of Building, and &s;hews it &s;elf a great way in the Country. Mr. Cambden &s;ays, this Town of Rippon owes its Greatne&s;s to Religion.</P>
<P>That here was a famous Mona&s;tery built by Wilfred, Archbi&s;hop of York, and that in the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tiani|ty, at lea&s;t in this I&s;land, is certain; but this pious Gift of the Bi&s;hop was &s;wal|lowed up &s;ome Years after, when the Danes over-running York&s;hire, rifled and burnt it to the Ground, as likewi&s;e the whole Town of Rippon: It afterwards flouri&s;hed again as a Mona&s;tery. But tho&s;e being all given up in the Reign of King Henry VIII the Church only was pre&s;erved. Mr Cambden &s;ays it was built, which I conceive rather to be form'd into a Church, from the Ruin of the Mona&s;tery, by the Contribution of the Gentry thereabours.</P>
<P>While it was a Mona&s;tery, here was a famous Sanctuary, a Thing however u&s;e|ful in &s;ome Ca&s;es, yet &s;o abu&s;ed in foreign, Countries, by making the Church a Re|fuge of Rogues, Thieves and Murther|ers, that 'tis happy for England it is out of u&s;e here. This Privilege of Sanctuary was it
<PB REF="394">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB REF="396">
&s;eems, granted to the Church of Rippon by King Athel&s;tan, An. and with this extraordinary Sanction, that who&s;oever broke the Rights of Sanctuary of the Church of Rippon, and which he extend|ed to a Mile on either Side the Church, &s;hould forfeit Life and E&s;tate; &s;o that, in &s;hort, not the Church only, but the whole Town, and a Circle of two Miles diameter, was like the Rules of the King's Bench here in Southwark, a Refuge for all that &s;led to it, where they liv'd &s;afe from all manner of Mole&s;tation, even from the King, or his Laws, or any Per|&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Annexed to this Mona&s;tery was an Ho&s;pital, the Intent and Purpo&s;e of which are very remarkable, and would be wor|thy imitation in our Days of Prote&s;tant Charity, when indeed I &s;ee nothing come up to it. The Hou&s;e was called the Ho&s;pital of St. Mary Magdalen, where, according to the Foundation, were to be maintained two Chaplains to perform Divine Service; and if any begging Clergyman, or other needy Per&s;ons, &s;hould happen to travel or &s;tray out of their Way, and call at the &s;aid Ho&s;pital, they &s;hould be relieved there for one Night only, with Food and a Bed, and to be gone in the Morning; and to every poor Per&s;on that came craving an Alms, on St. Mary Magdalen's Day yearly, they &s;hould give one Loaf, value a half Peny, when Corn was at the Price of five Shillings per Quarter, and one Her|ring.</P>
<P>Al&s;o 'tis recorded, that one Branch of this Ho&s;pital was founded and endowed, and given to a Society of religious Si&s;ters by a certain Archbi&s;hop of York. But the Inqui&s;ition taken does not find his Name, to the intent that they&punc; &s;hould maintain one Chaplain to perform Divine Service, and to the farther intent that they &s;hould maintain all the Lepers born and bred in Hip&s;chire, that &s;hould come to it for Maintenance; and that they &s;hould allow to each of them a Garment called Rak, and two pair of Shoes year|ly, with every Day a Loaf fit for a poor Man's &s;u&s;tenance, half a Pitcher of Beer, a &s;ufficient Portion of Fle&s;h on F$e&s;h Days, and three Herrings on Fi&s;h Days.</P>
<P>After this, other Gifts were added to this Foundation; al&s;o the Si&s;ters were re|moved, and a Brotherhood e&s;tabli&s;hed in their &s;tead, which continued &s;ome time; and after that a Ma&s;ter&s;hip; and the Main|tenance of Lepers finding no Clients, the Country proving healthy, that part was turned into a Charity, to be dealt out to the Poor on St. Mary Magdalen's Day, as above, At length all was demoli&s;hed to|gether, and the Hou&s;e, with the Mona&s;|tery, &s;uppre&s;s'd, as it now &s;tands, a Col|legiate Church being erected on the Place of it: Be&s;ides, it &s;eems upon another In|qui&s;ition, and a Jury empanelled to give their Verdict, it appeared in the 10th of Edward III. that the Revenue of one Branch of the Ho&s;pital had been embez|zled and &s;quandered away by the Ma&s;ter of the Ho&s;pital, the Charities interrupt|ed, and the Poor defrauded.</P>
<P>And &s;o in the Vi&s;itation of the Church, for it &s;eems there were Frauds and Embez|zlements in tho&s;e Days, even of the Goods of the Church, as well as &s;ince&punc; Mr. Dugdale, in his Mona&s;ticon, gives an Account, that William, Archbi&s;hop of York, in a Vi&s;itation of the Church of Rippon, Anno 1331. found it almo&s;t a|bandoned, notwith&s;tanding much Cure of Souls depended on it; that there were good Revenues belonging to it, but that they were con&s;umed by the ab&s;ent Can|ons. N. B. There was then al&s;o Non-Re&s;idence, and the Non Re&s;idents too de|vouring the Goods of the Church.</P>
<P>Upon this, the good Archbi&s;hop took order for the future, that all the Lands, Meadows, Revenues and Services (I give you the very Words of the Archbi&s;hop's Decree upon his Vi&s;itation) with the Tithes of Garbs and Hay, of Nyd and Grantilaye, with a Pen&s;ion of twenty Shillings due from the Vicar of Nyd, and the &s;piritual Juri&s;diction, and the Profits of the &s;ame, &s;hould, for the future, be
<PB REF="397">
divided among tho&s;e who &s;hould re|&s;ide at the Church of Rippon, and no other.</P>
<P>There were at that time, in this Church, nine Chanteries, be&s;ides two Out-Chan|teries in the Pari&s;h, the &s;ame which we call now Chapels of Ea&s;e; and be&s;ides the Chantery of the two Prie&s;ts in the Ho&s;pital, the Out-Chanteries were one at Hutton Conyers, and one at Clother|$m N B. A Chantery is any con$$c$at|$d Place where is an Oratory, and a Prie&s;t allowed to &s;ing Ma&s;s, and therefore called a Chantery or Singing hou&s;e.</P>

<P>The&s;e were noble Stipends in tho&s;e Days. How our Clergy would &s;erve at $his Time under &s;uch great Encourage|ment, is left to Enquiry, e&s;pecially the Organi&s;t's Salary was notable; from thence I may, I hope without offence, $$ppo&s;e, that he being a Layman, might $et Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Town, (perhaps he $as a Dancing-Ma&s;ter, or a Mu&s;ick-Ma&s;|$er, or both$ to teach the young Ladies $f Rippon; and his Wife might keep a $oarding School too; and &s;o the Gram|$ar School ma&s;ter might be a Writing-Ma&s;ter in the Town, and the like.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, the Church is &s;till $anding, tho' the Mona&s;tery and Ho&s;pital $$e &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the Canons and Choir $$e maintained at a much better Rate $an as above, for they now eat as good $eef, and drink as good Yo$k&s;hire Ale, $$ their Neighbours.</P>
<P>It is an antient Building, but firm and $$rong, the work Gothick, according to $$e Times, and plain; no Imagery or Sta|$es of any Note to be &s;een about it; there are three homely Spires, one on the Tower in the middle, and the other two on the Angle Towers of the We&s;t End; they are covered with Lead, but not very high or han&s;om.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not leave Rippon without giving the fam'd Tale of St. Wilfrid $word$ Needle. St. Wilfrid was the Saint to whom the Mona&s;tery was dedicated, $span$ Needle was, it &s;eems, for the trial of Charity. There was a dark Vault under Ground in one Part of the Mona&s;tery, into which there was an ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;ing one Way, but a narrow long En$$y&punc; al&s;o $span$ uneven to come out of it: If $span$ $ha$$ty was &s;u&s;pected, it d$$$ not &s;ay whether it was not for Men as well as Women but to be &s;ure it was for the latter, they were put into this Vault, and the fir&s;t Entrance being clo&s;|ed, they were at liberty to come out by the other, which was called the Needle, or the Eye of the Needle; if they were cha&s;te and untainted, they came out boldly, and without any difficulty; but if faulty, they were &s;topp'd&punc; and could not get along in the narrow Eye or Pa&s;|&s;age, and, as I think the Story &s;ays, were left there, unable to get out till they had confe&s;&s;ed their Fault. Whether the Prie&s;ts had no Craft in this Ca&s;e, to put &s;ome &s;ecret Barrier cro&s;s the nartow Pa&s;&s;age in the dark, &s;o to impo&s;e upon the poor Girls that were put to the trial, that I am not to enquire too far into: However it was, the Prie&s;ts made a Miracle of it; and the poor York&s;hire La&s;&s;es have, no doubt, good rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied that St. Wilfred has left off &s;howing tho&s;e mira|culous Things at this time.</P>
<P>In the Churchyard of this Min&s;ter lies a plain Monument or Grave&s;tone over the Remains of a generous Soul, who, in Charity, gave Two thou&s;and Pounds to pious U&s;es; the mode&s;t Epitaph is, how|ever, very important, as follows:</P>

<P>A M$le from this Town, or le&s;s&punc; is a &s;tately beautiful Seat, built a few Years &s;ince by Sir Edward Blacket; the Park is extended to the Bank of the River $word$ and is &s;ometimes in part laid under Water by the River, the Water of which, they &s;ay, coming down from the We&s;tern Mountains, thro' a marly, loamy Soil, fructifies the Earth, as the River Nile $$es the Egyptian Fields about Grand Ca$ro tho' by their leave not quite &s;o much.</P>
<P>As Sir Edward &s;pared no Co&s;t in the B$$lding, and Sir Ch$i&s;topher Wren laid $word$ the De&s;ign, as well as cho&s;e the Ground for him, you may believe me the better, when I add, that nothing can either add to the Contrivance or the Situation; the Building is of Brick, the Avenues, now the Trees are grown, are very fine, and the Gardens $word$ only well laid out, but $$ll planted, and as well kept; the $word$ are neat, the $word$ beautiful; but, as they want fine Gr$vel, the Walks can|not &s;hew them&s;elves, as in this Southern Part of England they would. The Hou&s;e has a fine Pro&s;pect over the Country, almo&s;t to York, with the River in view mo&s;t of the Way; and it makes it &s;elf a very noble Appearance to the great North Road, which lies within two Miles of it, at Burrow bridge.</P>
<P>As you now begin to come into the North Riding&punc; for the Eure parts the We$ Riding from it, &s;o you are come into the Place noted in the North of England for the be&s;t and large&s;t Oxen, and the fine&s;$ galloping Hor&s;es, I mean &s;wift Hor&s;es Hor&s;es bred, as we call it, for the light Saddle, that is to &s;ay, for the Race, the Cha$e, for Running or Hunting. Sir Edward was a Grazier&punc; and took &s;uch de|light in the Breeding and Feeding large &s;iz'd Black Car$$, that he had two or three times an Ox out of his Park led about the Country for a Sight, and &s;hewed as far as Newca&s;tle, and even to Scotland, for the bigge&s;t Bullock in England; nor was he very often, if ever, over match'd.</P>
<P>From this Town of Rippon, the North Road and the Roman Highway al&s;o, men|tioned before, which comes from Ca&s;tle|ford Bridge, part at Abberforth, leads away to a Town call'd Bedal, and, in a &s;trait Line (leaving Richmond about two Miles on the We&s;t) call'd Leeming Lane, goes on to Piersbridge on the River Tees, which is the farthe&s;t Boundary of the Coun|ty of York.</P>
<P>But before I go forward I &s;hould men|tion Burrow Bridge, which is but three Miles below Rippon, upon the &s;ame Ri|ver Eure, and which I mu&s;t take in my Way, that I may not be obliged to go farther out of the Way, on the next Jour|ney.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething very &s;ingular at this Town, and which is not to be found in any other Part of England or Scot|land, namely, two Borough Towns in one Pari&s;h, and each &s;ending two Members to Parliament, that is, Borough Brigg and Aldborough.</P>
<P>Borough Brigg, or Bridge, &s;eems to be the modern Town ri&s;en up out of Ald|borough, the very Names importing as much, (viz.) that Burrough at the Bridge,
<PB REF="400">
and the Old Borough that was before; and this Con&s;truction I pretend to ju&s;tfy from all the Antiquaries of our Age, or the la&s;t; who place on the Side of Ald|borough or Old Borough, an ancient City and Roman Colony, call'd <HI>I&s;urium Bri|gantum;</HI> the Arguments brought to prove the City &s;tood here, where yet at pre&s;ent nothing of a City is to be &s;een, no not &s;o much as the Ruins, e&s;pecially not above Ground, are out of my way for the pre&s;ent; only the digging up Coins, Urns, Vaults, Pavements, and the like, may be men|tioned, becau&s;e &s;ome of them are very eminent and remarkable ones, of which an Account is to be &s;een at large in Mr. Cambden, and his Continuator, to whom I refer. That this Old Burrough is the Remain of that City, is then out of doubt, and that the Burrough at the Bridge, is &s;ince grown up, and perhaps principally by the Confluence of Travel|lers, to pa&s;s the great Bridge over the Eure there; this &s;eems too out of que&s;|tion by the import of the Word. How either of them came to the Privilege of &s;ending Members to Parliament, whether by Charter and Incorporation, or meer Pre&s;cription, that is to &s;ay, a Claim of Age, which we call Time out of Mind, that remains for the Parliament to be &s;atisfied in. Certain it is, that the young|e&s;t of the two, that is, Burrow Bridge, is very old; for here, in the Barons Wars, was a Battle, and on this Bridge the great Bohun, Earl of Hereford, was kil|led by a Soldier, who lay concealed un|der the Bridge, and wounded him, by thru&s;ting a Spear or Pike into his Body, as he pa&s;s'd the Bridge. From whence Mr. Cambden very gravely judges, that it was not a Stone Bridge as is now, but a Bridge of Timber, a thing any Man might judge without being challenged for a Wizard.</P>
<P>I had not the Curio&s;ity &s;o much as to go to &s;ee the four great Stones in the Fields on the Left-hand, as you go thro' Burrow Bridge, which the Country Peo|ple, becau&s;e they wonder how they could come there, will have it they were brought by the Devil, and call them the Devil's Bolts. Mr. Camben de&s;cribes them, and they are no more than are frequent; and I have been oblged to &s;peak of &s;uch &s;o often, that I need &s;ay no more, but refer to other Authors to de&s;cribe the Romans Way of &s;etting up Trophics for Victory, or the Dead, or Places of Sa|crifices to their Gods, and which &s;oever it may be, the Matter is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>From the Eure entring the North Rid|ing, and keeping the Roman Cau&s;eway, as mentioned before, one part of which went by this I&s;urium Brigan$um from York, we came to Bedall, all the Way from Hutton, or thereabout, this Roman way is plain to be &s;een&punc; and is called now Leeming Lane, from Leeming Chapel, a Village which it goes through</P>
<P>I met nothing at or about Bedall, that comes within the compa&s;s of my En|quiry but this, that not this Town only, but even all this Country, is full of Jockeys, that is to &s;ay, Dealers in Hor&s;es, and Breeders of Hor&s;es; and the Breeds of their Hor&s;es in this and the next Country are &s;o well known, that tho' they do not pre&s;erve the Pedigree of their Hor&s;es for a Succe&s;&s;ion of Ages, as they &s;ay they do in Arabia and in Barbary, yet they chri&s;ten their Stallions here, and know them, and will advance the Price of a Hor&s;e according to the Reputation of the Hor&s;e he came of.</P>
<P>They do indeed breed very $ine Hor&s;es here, and perhaps &s;ome of the be&s;t in the World, for let Foreigners boa&s;t what they will of Barbs and Turki&s;h Hor&s;es, and, as we know five hundred Pounds has been given for a Hor&s;e brought out of Turkey, and of the Spani&s;h Jennets from Cordoua, for which al&s;o an extravagant Price has been given, I do believe that &s;ome of the Gallopers of this Country, and of the Bi&s;hoprick of Du$ham, which joins to it, will out-do for Speed and Strength the &s;wifte&s;t Hor&s;e that was ever bred in Turkey, or Barbary, take them all together&punc;</P>
<P><PB REF="401">
Rea&s;on for this Opinion is found|$d upon tho&s;e Words altogether; that is $o &s;ay, take their Strength and their Speed $ogether; for example; match the two $or&s;es, and bring them to the Race Po&s;t, $e Barb may beat York&s;hire for a Mile Courle, but Yorkire &s;hall Di&s;tance him at the end of four Miles; the Barb &s;hall beat York&s;hire upon a dry, &s;oft Carpet Ground, but York&s;hire for a deep Coun|ty; the Rea&s;on is plain, the Engli&s;h Hor&s;es have both the Speed and the $trength; the Barb perhaps &s;hall beat York&s;hire, and carry &s;even Stone and a $alf: but York&s;hire for a twelve to 14 tone weight; in a word, York&s;hire &s;hall $$y the Man, and the Barb a Feather.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on is to be &s;een in the very $ake of the Hor&s;es. The Barb, or the $onet, is a &s;ine delicate Creature, of a $autiful Shape, clean Limbs, and a &s;oft $at; but then he is long jointed, weak $tured, and under limb'd: Whereas $ork&s;hire has as light a Body, and &s;tron|$ Limbs, &s;hort Joints, and well Bon'd. $is gives him not Speed only but $ength to hold it; and, I believe, I do $word$ boa&s;t in their behalf, without good $chers, when I &s;ay, that Engli&s;h Hor|$ take them one with another, will $word$ all the World.</P>
<P>As this Part of the Country is &s;o much $loyed in Hor&s;es, the young Fellows naturally Grooms, bred up in the $ble, and u&s;ed to lie among the Hor&s;es; $hat you cannot fail of a good Servant $word$ for looking after Hor&s;es is their par|$ar Delight; and this is the Rea&s;on $word$ whatever Part of England you go though the farthe&s;t Counties We&s;t South, and whatever Inn you come $is two to one but the Ho&s;tler is a $&s;hire Man; for as they are bred a|$ Hor&s;es, 'tis always the fir&s;t Bu&s;i|$ they recommend them&s;elves to; and $u ask a York&s;hire Man, at his fir&s;t $ng up to get a Service, what he can his an&s;wer is, Sir, he can look after Hor&s;e, for he handles a Curry-Comb as naturally as a young Serivener does a Pen and Ink.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their Breeding of Hor&s;es, they are al&s;o good Gra&s;iers over this whole Country, and have a large, noble Breed of Oxen, as may be &s;een at North Al|lerton Fairs, where there are an incredi|ble Quantity of them bought eight times every Year, and brought Southward as far as the Fens in Lincoln&s;hire and the I$le of Ely, where, being but, as it were, half fat before, they are fed up to the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of Fat which we &s;ee in London Markets. The Market whether the&s;e North Country Cattle are generally brought is to St. Ives, a Town between Huntington and Cambridge, upon the River Ou&s;e, and where there is a very great Number of far Cattle every Mon|day.</P>
<P>Richmond, which, as I &s;aid, is two or three Mile wide of the Leeming Lane, is a large Market Town, and gives Name to this Part of the Country, which is called after it Richmond&s;hire, as another Part of it Ea&s;t of this is called North Al|lerton&s;hire.</P>
<P>Here you begin to find a Manufacture on Foot again, and&punc; as before, all was Cloathing, and all the People Clothiers, here you &s;ee all the People, great and &s;mall, a Knitting; and at Richmond you have a Market for Woollen or Yarn Stockings, which they make very coar&s;e and ordinary, and they are &s;old accord|ingly; for the &s;malle&s;t &s;iz'd Stockings for Childran are here &s;old for eighteen Pence per dozen, or three half Pence a pair, &s;ometimes le&s;s.</P>
<P>This Trade extends it&s;elf al&s;o into We&s;tmore-land, or rather comes from We&s;tmore-land, extending it&s;elf hither, for at Kendal, Kirkby, Stephen, and &s;uch other Places in this County as border up|on York&s;hire; the chief Manufacture of Yarn Stockings is carried on; it is indeed a very con&s;iderable Manufacture in it it &s;elf, and of late mightily encrea&s;ed too, is all the Manufactures of England in|deed are.</P>
<P><PB REF="402">
This Town of Richmond (Cambden call'd it a City) is wall'd, and had a &s;trong Ca&s;tle$ but as tho&s;e Things are now all flighte$, $u really the Account of them is of &s;mall con&s;equence, and needle&s;s; $ld Fortifications being, if Fortification was wanted, of very little &s;ignification; the River Swale runs under the Wall of this Ca&s;tle, and has &s;ome unevenne&s;s at its Bottom, by rea&s;on of Rocks which in|rercept its Pa&s;&s;age, &s;o that it falls like a Cataract&punc; but not with &s;o great a Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Swale is a noted River, though not extraordinary large, for giving Name to the Lands which it runs through for &s;ome Length which are called S$ale Dale, and to an ancient Family of that Name, one of whom had the Vanity, as I have heard, to boa&s;t that his Family was &s;o ancient as not $word$ $eceive that Name from, but to give Name to the River it&s;elf. One of the worthle&s;s Succe&s;&s;ors of this Line, who had brought him&s;elf to the Dignity of what they call in London, a Fleeter, u&s;ed to write him&s;elf, in his abun|dant Vanity, Sir Solomon Swale, of Swale Hall, in Swale Dale, in the County of Swale in the North Riding of York.</P>
<P>This addition of Dale, fir&s;t given here to the low Lands about the Head of the Swale, is grown up into a Cu&s;tom or U&s;age from all the Rivers which ri&s;e in tho&s;e We&s;tern Hills North of this, quite to and into Scotland; for example,</P>
<P>Tee&s;dale for the River Tees.</P>
<P>Wierdale for the Wier, which runs through Durham.</P>
<P>Tine Dale for the Tine, which runs to Newca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Tweedale for the Tweed, which pa&s;&s;eth by Berwick.</P>
<P>Cly$dale Nyd&s;dale, and many others.</P>
<P>Leaving Richmond, we continue through this long Leeming Lane, which holds for about the length of &s;ix Miles to the Bank of Tees, where we pa&s;s'd over the Ri|ver Tees at Piersbridge; the Tees is a mo&s;t terrible River, &s;o rapid, that they tell us a Story of a Man who coming to the Ferry Place in the Road to Dar|lington, and finding the Water low be|gan to pull of his Ho$e and Shoes to wade thro', the Water not Long deep enough to reach to his K$ees, but that while he was going over, the $word$ &s;well'd &s;o fa&s;t as to carry him away $word$ and drown him.</P>
<P>This Bridge leads into the Bi&s;hop$$s of Durham, and the Road &s;oon $word$ into the great Po&s;t-Road $word$ to the City of Durham I &s;hall $word$ longer upon the Particulars to $span$ Side except Barnard Ca&s;tle, which is $word$ four Miles di&s;tant from the Tees $word$ We&s;t, and there I may &s;peak of it age as all the Country round here are $word$ as is noted before; &s;o here and $word$ abouts they have an excellent $word$ dre&s;&s;ing Hor&s;es Hides into $span$ thinking or making us think it is $word$ that is to &s;ay, that it $span$ wear out; in a word, they make the $word$ Bridle Reins, Belts broad or narrow&punc; $word$ all Accoutrements for a compleat $word$ ma&s;ter, as they do at Rippon for $word$ Stirrups.</P>
<P>Bernard's Ca&s;tle &s;tands on the $word$ Side of the Tees, and &s;o is in the $word$ &s;hoprick of Durham. 'Tis an $word$ Town, and pretty well built, but $word$ large; the Manufacture of Yarn $word$ continues thus far, but not $word$ farther; but the Jockeys multiply $word$ way; and here we &s;aw &s;ome very $word$ Hor&s;es indeed; but as they $word$ Goodne&s;s, &s;o they wanted no $word$ valued for the Stallion they $word$ and the merit of the Breed. One $word$ beautiful Stone-hor&s;e which they $word$ kept, they asked two hundred $word$ for; but, as I heard afterwards, tho' $word$ carried him to London, which was &s;mall addition to the Charge of him, $word$ &s;old him for much le&s;s Money.</P>
<P>The length of the late War, it $word$ cau&s;ed the Breeders here to run $word$ race or kind of Hor&s;es, differing $word$ from what they were u&s;ed to rai&s;e, $word$ is to &s;ay, from fine fleet Hor&s;es for $word$ loping and Hunting, to a larger $word$
<PB REF="403" MS="Y">
Charging Hor&s;es, for the U&s;e of the Ge|neral Officers, and Colonels of Hor&s;e, Aids du Camp, and the like, who&s;e Ser|vice required &s;trong Charging Hor&s;es, and yet if they were fleet Hor&s;es too, they had a va&s;t Advantage of the Enemy; for that if the Rider was conquered and forced to fly, there was no overtaking him; and if his Enemies fled they could never get away from him. I &s;aw &s;ome of this Breed, and very noble Creatures they were, fit for any Bu&s;ine&s;s whatever; &s;trong enough for Charging, fleet enough for Hunting, tempered enough for Tra|velling; and indeed, there is one thing to be &s;aid for the Hor&s;e Breeders in this Country, their Hor&s;es are all well broke, perfectly brought to Hand, and to be un|der Command, which is a thing ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the Army, and in the Hunt|ing Field al&s;o.</P>
<P>I was come now to the extent of the County of York Northward. But as I have kept all along to the We&s;t Side of the Country, even from the Peak of Darby hither; and that I have all the Ea&s;t Riding and the Ea&s;tern Part of the North and We&s;t Riding to go over, I &s;hall break off here.</P>
<TRAILER>The <HI>END</HI> of the <HI>8</HI>th <HI>JOURNEY,</HI></TRAILER>

<DIV1>
<HEAD>JOURNEY IX.</HEAD>
<P>I Began my eight Journey at the Bank of Trent, namely, at Nottingham-Bridge, and keeping the middle of the I&s;land, travelled due Not$h into $word$ We&s;t Riding of York&s;hire, and to $he farthe&s;t Part of the Country to the Bank of Tees, as you have &s;een.</P>
<P>I am now come back, as the French &s;ay, <HI>&s;ur mes pas,</HI> to the &s;ame Bank of the Trent, though lower down, towards the Ea&s;t and &s;hall gather up &s;ome Frag|ments of Nottingham&s;hire and the We&s;t Riding of York&s;hire, as I go, and then ha&s;ten to the Sea Side, where we have not not ca&s;t our Eye yet.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing Newark Bridge we went through the lower Side of Nottingham&s;hire, keep|ing within the River Idle. Here we &s;aw Tuxford in the Clays, that is to &s;ay, Tuxford in the Dirt, and a little dirty Market Town it is, &s;uitable to its Name.</P>
<P>Then we &s;aw Rhetford, a pretty lit|tle Borough Town of good Trade&punc; &s;ituate on the River Idle; the Mayor treated us like Gentlemen, though him&s;elf but a Trade&s;man; he gave us a Di&s;h of Fi&s;h from the River Idle, and another from the Trent, which I only note, to inti|mate that the Salmon of the Trent is very valuable in this Country, and is of|ten times brought to London, exceeding large and fine; at Newark they have it very large, and likewi&s;e at Nottingham.</P>
<P>From Rherford, the Country on the Right of Ea&s;t lies low and mar&s;hy, till, by the Confluence of the Rivers Trent, Idle and Don, they are formed into large I&s;lands, of which the fir&s;t is called the I&s;le of Axholm, where the Lands are ve|ry rich, and feed great Store of Cattle: But travelling into tho&s;e Parts being dif|ficult, and &s;ometimes dangerous, e&s;peci|ally
<PB REF="404">
or Strangers, we contented our&s;elves with having the Country de&s;cribed to us, as above, and with being a&s;&s;ured that there were no Towns of Note, or any thing to be call'd curious, except that they dig old Fir Trees out of the Ground in the I&s;le of Axholm, which they tell us have lain there ever &s;ince the Deluge; but, as I &s;hall meet with the like more eminently in many other Places, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with &s;peaking of it once for all, when we come into Lanca|&s;hire.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome few Market Towns in the&s;e low Parts between this Place and the Humber, though none of great Con|&s;ideration, &s;uch as Thorne upon the Don, Snathe upon the Aire, Selby upon the Ou&s;e, and Howdon near the &s;ame River; the two la&s;t are Towns of good Trade, the fir&s;t being &s;eated where the Ou&s;e is navigable, for large ve&s;&s;els has a good &s;hare in the Shipping of the River, and &s;ome Merchants live and thrive here; the latter is one of the Towns in England, where their annual Fairs pre&s;erve the Name of a Mart, the other Lyn, Bo&s;ton, Ganesborough, Beverley, tho' of late they begin to lo&s;e the Word. The Fair or Mart held here is very con&s;idera|ble for Inland Trade, and &s;everal Whole|&s;ale Trade&s;men come to it from London. But I take this Town to be more famous for the Birth of one of our ancient Hi&s;|torians, (viz.) Roger of Hovedon or Howdon; Mr. Cambden's Continuator is much in the wrong to &s;ay this Town &s;tands upon the Derwent; whereas it is above three Mile Ea&s;t of the Derwent, and no River of any note near it but the Humber.</P>
<P>Having found nothing in this low Part of the Country but a wonderful Conflux of great Rivers, all pouring down into the Humber, which receiving the Aire, the Ou&s;e, the Don and the Trent, be|comes rather a Sea than a River, we left it on the Right; and knowing we &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily vi&s;it its Shores again, we turn|ed up into the Po&s;t Road, where, as I &s;aid, I left it before near Brotherton, and went on for Tadca&s;ter.</P>
<P>On this Road we pa&s;s'd over Towten, that famous Field where the m$&s;t $word$ and bloody Battle was fought between the two Hou&s;es of Lanca&s;ter and York, in the Reign of Edward IV. I call it mo&s;t cruel and bloody, becau&s;e the Animo&s;ity of the Parties was &s;o great, that tho' they were Countrymen and Engli&s;hmen, Neigh|bours, nay, as Hi&s;tory &s;ays, Relations&punc; for here Fathers kill'd their Sons, and Sons their Fathers; yet for &s;ome time they $ought with &s;uch Ob&s;tinacy a$d &s;uch Rancour&punc; that void of all Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion, they gave no Quarter, and I call it the mo&s;t bloody, becau&s;e 'tis certain no &s;uch Numbers were ever &s;lain in one Battle in England, &s;ince the great Battle between King Harold and William of Normandy, call'd the Conqueror, at Battle in Su&s;&s;ex; for here, at Towten fell Six and thirty thou&s;and Men on both Sides, be&s;ides the wounded and Pri&s;oners (if they took any.)</P>
<P>Tradition guided the Country People, and they us, to the very Spot; but we had only the Story in &s;peculation; for there remains no Marks, no Monument, no Remembrance of the Action, only that the Ploughmen &s;ay, that &s;ometimes they plough up Arrow-heads and Spe$ heads, and broken Javelins, and Helmet&punc; and the like; &s;o we could only give a &s;hort Sigh to the memory of the Dead, and move forward.</P>
<P>Tadca&s;ter has nothing that we could &s;ee to te&s;tify the Antiquity it boa&s;ts of, but &s;ome old Roman Coins, which our Lanlord the Po&s;t Ma&s;ter &s;hew'd us, among which was one of Domitian, the &s;ame kind, I believe, with that Mr. Cambden, gives an Account of, but &s;o very much defaced with Age, that we could read but D O, and A V, at a di&s;tance. Here is the Ho&s;pital and School, &s;till remaining founded by Dr. Oglethorp, Bi&s;hop of Car|li&s;le, who, for want of a Prote&s;tant Arch|bi&s;hop, &s;et the Crown on the Head of Queen Elizabeth.</P>

Here al&s;o we &s;aw plainly the Roman Highway, which I have mentioned, as $een at Aberforth; and, as antient Writers $ell us, of a &s;tately Stone Bridge here; I $ay tell you; here was no Bridge at all; $ut perhaps no Writer after me will ever $e able to &s;ay the like; for the Ca&s;e was this, the antient famous Bridge&punc; which I &s;uppo&s;e, had &s;tood &s;everal hundred Years, being defective, was ju&s;t pull'd down, and the Foundation of a New Bridge, was &s;aid, or rather begun to be laid, or was $ying; and we were obliged to go over $he River in a Ferry Boat; but coming $hat way &s;ince, I &s;aw the new Bridge $$ni&s;hed, and very magnificent indeed it $word$.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden gives us a little Di&s;tich $f a learned Pa&s;&s;enger upon this River; $nd the old Bridge, at Tadca&s;ter; I &s;up|po&s;e he pa&s;s'd it in a dry Summer, as the $renchman did the Bridge at Madrid, which I mentioned before.
<Q><L>"Nil Tadca&s;ter habes muris vel car|mine dignum,</L>
<L>&punc;Praeter magnifice &s;truct$m &s;ine flumine pontem.</L></Q></P>
<P>But I can a&s;&s;ure the Reader of this Ac|$ount, that altdo' I pa&s;s'd this Place in $e middle of Summer, we found Water $$ough in the River, &s;o that there was no $&s;&s;ing it without a Boat.</P>
<P>From Tadca&s;ter it is but twelve Miles York; the Country is rich, fruitful $word$ populous, but not like the We&s;tern $rts about Leeds, Wakefield, Hallifax, $word$ which I de&s;cribed above; it bears $word$ Corn, and the City of York being near, and having the Navigation of &s;o $ny Rivers al&s;o to carry it to Hull, $y never want a good Market for it.</P>
<P>The Antiquity of York, tho' it was $word$ the particular Enquiry I propo&s;ed to $ke, yet &s;hewed it&s;elf &s;o vi&s;ibly at a $ance that we could not but ob&s;erve $efore we came quite up to the City, $ean the Mount and high Hills, where antient Ca&s;tle &s;tood, which when you come to the City, you &s;carcely &s;ee, at lea&s;t not &s;o as to judge of its Anti|quity.</P>
<P>The Cathedral, or the Min&s;ter, as they call it, is a fine Building, but not &s;o antient as &s;ome of the other Churches in the City &s;eem to be: That Mount I mentioned above, and which, at a di&s;tance, I &s;ay was a Mark of Antiquity, is called the old Bale, which was &s;ome Ages ago fortified and made very &s;trong; but Time has eaten through not the Timber and Plank only, which they &s;ay it was fir&s;t built with, but even the Stones and Mor|tar; for not the lea&s;t Foot&s;teep of it re|mains but the Hill.</P>
<P>York is indeed a plea&s;ant and beauti|ful City, and not at all the le&s;s beautiful for the Works and Lines about it being demoli&s;hed, and the City$ as it may be &s;aid, being laid open; for the beauty of Peace is &s;een in the rubbi&s;h; the Lines and Ba&s;tions and demoli&s;hed Fortifications, have a re&s;erved &s;ecret plea&s;antne&s;s in them from the Contemplation of the publick Tranquility, that out&s;hines all the beauty of advanced Ba&s;tions, Batteries, Cavaliers, and all the hard named Works of the Engineers about a City.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not entertain you either with a Plan of the City; or a Draught of its Hi&s;tory; I &s;hall only &s;ay in general, the fir&s;t would take up a great deal of Time, and the la&s;t a great deal of Paper; it is enough to tell you, that as it has been always a &s;trong Place, &s;o it has been much contended for, been the Seat of War, the Rendezvous of Armies, and of the great|e&s;t Generals &s;everal times.</P>
<P>It boa&s;ts of being the Seat of &s;ome of the Roman Emperors, and the Station of their Forces for the North of Britain, be|ing it &s;elf a Roman Colony, and the like, all which I leave as I find it; it may be examined critically in Mr. Cambde$&punc; and his Continuator, where it is learnedly debated. However, this, I mu&s;t not omit namely, that Severus and Con&s;tantius Chlorus, Father to Con&s;tantine the Great, both kept their&punc; Courts here, and both
<PB REF="406">
died here. Here Con&s;tantine the Great took upon him the Pu$ple, and began the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Empire in the World; and this is truly and really an Honour to the City of York; and this is all I &s;hall &s;ay of her Antiquity.</P>
<P>But now things infinitely modern, com|pared to tho&s;e, are become Marks of An|tiquity; for even the Ca&s;tle of York, built by William the Conqueror, Anno 1069. almo&s;t eight hundred Years &s;ince Con&s;tantine, is not only become ancient and decayed, but even &s;unk into Time, and almo&s;t lo&s;t and forgotten; Fires, Sieges, Plunderings and Deva&s;tations, have often been the Fate of York; &s;o that one &s;hould wander there &s;hould be any thing of a City left.</P>
<P>But 'tis ri&s;en again, and all we &s;ee now is modern; the Bridge is va&s;tly &s;trong, and has one Arch which, they tell me, was near 70 Foot in Diameter; it is, without exception, the greate&s;t in Eng|land, &s;ome &s;ay it's as large as the Rialto at Venice, though I think not.</P>
<P>The Cathedral too is modern, it was begun to be built in the Time of Edward the Fir&s;t, Anno 1313. or thereabouts, by one John Roman, who was Trea&s;urer for the Undertaking; the Foundation being laid, and the whole Building de&s;igned by the $word$ Benevolence of the Gentry, and e&s;pecially, as a noted Antiquary there a&s;&s;ured me, by the particular application of two eminent Families in the North, namely, the Piercys and Vava&s;ors, as is re&s;ti&s;$ed by their Arms and Portraits cut in the Stone work; the fir&s;t with a Piece of Timber, and the la&s;t with a hew'd Stone in their Hands; the fir&s;t having given a large Wood, and the latter a Quarry of Stone, for encouraging the Work.</P>
<P>It was building during the Lives of three Archbi&s;hops, all of the Chri&s;tian Name of John, whereof the la&s;t, (viz) John Thoresby, lived to &s;ee it fini&s;hed, and him&s;elf con&s;ecrated it.</P>
<P>It is a Gothick Building, but with all the mo&s;t modern <HI>Addenda</HI> that Order of Building can admit; and with much more Ornament of a &s;ingular kind, than we &s;ee any thing of that way of Building grac'd with. I &s;ee nothing of that $word$ of Structure in England go beyond except it be the Building we call $word$ Henry VIIth's Chapel, a$d$$onal to $word$ Abbey Church at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and the is not to be named with this, becau&s;e&punc; is but a Chapel, and that but a &s;mall $word$ neither.</P>
<P>The Royal Chapel at $span$ King's College Chapel, at $span$ indeed very gay Things, but $word$ them can come up to the $word$ York on many Accounts; al&s;o $word$ Tower of the Cathedral Church at $$|terbury is named to match with at $word$ but this is but a Piece of a large $word$ the re&s;t of the &s;ame Building $word$ mean and gro&s;s, compared with $word$ York.</P>
<P>The only d$ficiency I find at Y$$ Min&s;ter, is the lowne&s;s of the Tower, or its want of a $word$ $word$ it, which, doubtle&s;s, was $word$ Builders; he that lately $span$ &s;cription of this Church, a$d $span$ ca&s;ter, placed high fine Sp$$es $span$ both, took a great deal of Pa$$s to $word$ us he was $span$ had $span$ telligence gro&s;ly upon tru&s;t.</P>
<P>As then this Church was &s;o $word$ fini&s;hed, and that &s;o lately that $word$ not yet four hundred Years old it is $word$ le&s;s to be wondered that the Work $word$ &s;o firm and fine, that it is now $word$ beautifulle&s;t Church of the old $word$ that is in Britain. In a word, th$ $word$ End is a Picture, and &s;o is the $word$ the out&s;ides of the Quire e&s;pecially $word$ to be equall'd.</P>
<P>The Choir of the Church, and the $word$ Spaces round and behind it, are $word$ of noble and magnificent Monumen$s, $word$ many to enter upon the De&s;cription them here, &s;ome in Marble, and $word$ in the old manner in&punc; Bra&s;s, and the Wi$|dows are finely painted; but I could $word$ no Body learned enough in the $word$
<PB REF="407">
$hat could read the Hi&s;tories to us that were delineated there.</P>
<P>The Chapter-Hou&s;e is a Beauty indeed, and it has been always e&s;teemed &s;o, wit|ne&s;s the Latin Ver&s;e which is written up|on it in Letters of Gold.</P>

<P>But, allowing this to be a little too much of a Boa&s;t, it mu&s;t be own'd to be an excellent Piece of Work, and indeed &s;o i$ the whole Min&s;ter; nor does it want any thing, as I can &s;uppo&s;e, but, as I $aid before, a fine Spire upon the Tow|$r, &s;uch a one as is at Grantham, or at Newark.

<P>But to return to the City it &s;elf; there $s ab$ndande of good Company here, and $word$ of good Families live here, $span$ of the good Company and $span$ a Man conver&s;es here with $ll the World as effectually as at London; $he keeping up A&s;&s;emblies among the $$$$ger Gentry was fir&s;t fet up here, a $hing other Writers recommend mightily $word$ the Character of a good Country, and of a plea&s;ant Place; but which I look $span$ with a different View, and e&s;teem it $word$ a Plan laid for the Ruin of the Na|$ion's Morals, and which, in time, threat|ens us with too much Succe&s;s that way.</P>
<P>However, to do the Ladies of York|&s;hire Ju&s;tice, I found they did not gain any great &s;hare of the ju&s;t Reproach which in &s;ome other Places has been due to their Sex, nor has there been &s;o ma|ny&punc; young Fortunes carried off here by half-pay Men, as has been &s;aid to be in other Towns, of merry Fame, We&s;tward and Southward.</P>
<P>The Government of the City is that of a regular Corporation, by Mayor, Al|dermen and Common Council; the Mayor has the Honour here, by ancient Pre&s;crip|tion of being called <HI>my Lord;</HI> it is a County within its &s;elf, and has a Juri&s;|diction extended over a &s;mall Tract of Land on the We&s;t Suburb, called the Li|berty of An&s;ty, which I could get no uniform account of, one pretending one thing, one another. The City is old but well built; and the Clergy, I mean &s;uch as &s;erve in, and depend upon the Cathe|dral, have very good Hou&s;es, or little Palaces rather here, adjoining to the Cy|meterie, or Church-yard of the Min&s;ter; the Bi&s;hop's is indeed called a Palace, and is really &s;o; the Deanery is a large, convenient and &s;pacious Hou&s;e; and among the&s;e Dwellings of the Clergy is the A&s;|&s;embly Hou&s;e. Whence I would infer, the Conduct of it is under the better Go|vernment, or &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>No City in England is better furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ions of every kind, nor any &s;o cheap, in proportion to the goodne&s;s of Things; the River being &s;o naviga|ble, and &s;o near the Sea, the Merchants here trade directly to what part of the World they will; for Ships of any Bur|then come up within thirty Miles of the City, and &s;mall Craft from &s;ixty or eighty Ton, and under, come up to the very City.</P>
<P>With the&s;e they carry on a con&s;ider|able Trade; they import their own Wines from France and Portugal, and likewi&s;e their own Deals and Timber from Nor|way; and indeed what they plea&s;e almo&s;t $rom where they plea&s;e, they did al&s;o bring their own Coals from Newca&s;tle and Sunderland, but now have them down

the Aire and Calder from Wakefield, and from Leeds, as I have &s;aid already.</P>
<P>The Publick Buildings $rdcted here are are very con&s;iderable, &s;uch as Halls for their Merchants and Trades, a large Town-Hou&s;e or Guild-Hall, and the Pri&s;on, which is &s;pacious, and takes up all the Ground within the Walls of the Old Ca&s;tle, and, in a Building newly erected there, the A&s;&s;izes for the County are kept.</P>
<P>The Old Walls are &s;tanding, and the Gates and Po&s;terns; but the old addition|al Works which were ca&s;t up in the late $word$ are &s;lighted; &s;o that York is not $span$ as it was then: But Things lie &s;o too, that a little Time, and many Hands, would put tho&s;e Works into their former Condition, and make the City able to &s;tand out a &s;mall Siege. But as the Ground &s;eems capable by Si|tuation, &s;o an ingenious Head&punc; in our Company, taking a &s;tricter View of it, told us, he would undertake to make it as &s;trong as Tournay in Flanders, or as Namure, allowing him to add a Citadel at that end next the River. But this is a Speculation; and 'tis much better that we &s;hould hrve no need of fortified Towns than that we &s;hould &s;eek out good Situa|tions to make them.</P>
<P>While we were at York, we took one Day's time to &s;ee the fatal Field called Mar&s;ton Moor, where Prince Rupert, a third time, by his exce&s;s of Valour, and defect of Conduct, lo&s;t the Royal Army, and had a Victory wrung out of his Hands, after he had all the Advantage in his own Hands that he could de&s;ire: Cer|tain it is, that Charging at the Head of the Right Wing of Hor&s;e with that intre|pid Courage that he always &s;hewed, he bore down all before him in the very beginning of the Battle, and not only put the Enemies Cavalry into Confu|&s;ion, but drove them quite out of the Field.</P>
<P>Could he have bridled his Temper, and, like an old Soldier, or rather an experi|enced General, have contented him&s;elf with the Glory of that part, &s;ending but one Brigade of his Troops on in the pur|&s;uit, which h$d been &s;ufficient to have fini&s;hed the Work, and have kept the Enemies from rallying, and then with the re&s;t of his Cavalry, wheeled to the Left, and fallen in upon the Croup of the Right Wing of the Enemies Cavalry, he had made a Day of it, and gained the mo&s;t glorious Victory of that Age; for he had a gallant Army. But he followed the Chace clear off, and out of the Field of Battle; and when he began to return, he had the misfortune to &s;ee that his Left Wing of Hor&s;e was defeated by Fairfax and Cromwell, and to meet his Friends flying for their Lives; &s;o that he had no|thing to do but to fly with them, and leave his infantry, and the Duke, then Marquis of Newca&s;tle's, old Veteran Soldiers to be cut in Pieces by the E|nemy.</P>
<P>I had one Gentleman with me, an old Soldier too, who, though he was not in the Fight, yet gave us a compleat Ac|count of the Action from his Father's re|lation, who, he &s;aid, had &s;erved in it, and who had often &s;hewed him upon the very Spot every&punc; part of the Engagement where every di&s;tinct Body was drawn up, how far the Lines extended, how the In|fantry were flank'd by the Cavalry, a$$ the Cavalry by the Woods, where the Artillery were planted, and which wa$ they pointed; and he accordingly de|&s;cribed it in &s;o lively a manner to me, that I thought it was as if I had ju&s;t now &s;een the two Armies engaging.</P>
<P>His relation of Prince Rupert's ill Conduct, put me in mind of the quite different Conduct of old General Tilly, who commanded the Imperial Army at the great Battle of Leip&s;ick in Germany, again&s;t that glorious Prince Gu&s;tavus A|dolphus.</P>
<P><PB REF="411">
Upon the fir&s;t Charge, the Cavalry of the Right Wing of Tilly's Army, com|manded by the Count of Fur&s;temburgh, f$ll on with &s;uch Fury, and in &s;uch excel|lent Order, being all old Troops, and mo&s;t of them Cuira&s;&s;ers, upon the Saxon Troops, which had the Left of the Swed|i&s;h Army, and made Twenty two thou|&s;and Men, that, in &s;hort, they put them into Confu&s;ion, and drove them upon their Infantry of the main Battle $o $hat all went off together except General Arnhcim, who commanded the Saxon Right Wing, and was drawn up next to the Swedes.</P>
<P>The Saxon being thus put into Con|fu&s;ion, the Imperiali&s;ts cried Victoria, the Enemy fly, and their General Officers cry'd out to Tilly to let them follow. No, &s;ays Tilly, let 'em go, let 'em go; but let us beat the Swedes too, or we do no|thing, and immediately he ordered the Cavalry that had performed &s;o well, &s;hould face to the Left, and charge the re&s;t of the Army in Flank. But the King of Swed|en, who &s;aw the Di&s;order, and was ready at all Places to encourage and direct his Troops, ordered Six thou&s;and Scots, un|der Sir John Hepburn, who made his Line of Re&s;erve, to make a Front to the Left, and face the victorious Troops of $he Imperiali&s;ts, while, in the mean time, with a Fury not to be re&s;i&s;ted, he charg|ed, in Per&s;on, upon the Imperial Left, Wing, and bore down all before him.</P>
<P>Then it appeared that Count Tilly was in the right; for though he had not let his Right Wing pur&s;ue the Saxons, who, notwith&s;tanding being new Men, never rallied, yet with his whole Army he was not able to beat the re&s;t; but the King of Sweden gained the mo&s;t glorious Victory that ever a Prote&s;tant Army had till then obtained in the World over a Popi&s;h. This was 1632</P>
<P>I came back extremely well plea&s;ed with the View of Mar&s;ton Moor, and the Account my Friend had given of the Bat|tle; 'twas none of our Bu&s;ine&s;s to con|cern our Pa&s;&s;ions in the Cau&s;e, or regret the Misfortunes of that Day; the thing was over beyond our ken; Time had levelled the Victors with the Vanqui&s;h|ed, and the Royal Family being re&s;tored, there was no room to &s;ay one thing or other to what was pa&s;s'd; &s;o we returned to York the &s;ame Night.</P>
<P>York, as I have &s;aid, is a &s;pacious Ci|ty, it &s;tands upon a great deal of Ground, perhaps more than any City in England out of Middle&s;ex, except Norwich; but then the Buildings are not clo&s;e and throng|ed as at Bri&s;tol, or as at Durham; nor is York &s;o populous as either Bri&s;tol or Nor|wich. But as York is full of Gentry and Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, &s;o they live at large, and have Hou&s;es proportioned to their Quality; and this makes the City lie &s;o far extended on both Sides the Ri|ver. It is al&s;o very magnificent, and, as we &s;ay, makes a good Figure every way in its appearance, even at a di&s;tance; for the Cathedral is &s;o noble and &s;o augu&s;t a Pile, that 'tis a Glory to all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>There are very neat Churches here be|&s;ides the Cathedral, and were not the Min|&s;ter &s;tanding, like the Capitol in the mid|dle of the City of Rome, &s;ome of the&s;e would pa&s;s for extraordinary, as the Churches of St. Mary's and Allhallows, and the Steeples of Chri&s;t-Church, St. Mary's, St. Peg's, and Allhallows.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o two &s;ine Market hou&s;es, with the Town hall upon the Bridge, and abundance of other publick Edifices, all which together makes this City, as I &s;aid, more &s;tately and magnificent, though not more populous and wealthy, than any o|ther City in the King's Dominions, Lon|don and Dublin excepted. The rea&s;on of the difference is evidently for the want of Trade.</P>
<P>Here is no Trade indeed, except &s;uch as depends upon the Confluence of the Gentry: But the City, as to Lodgings, good Hou&s;es, and plenty of Provi&s;ions, is able to receive the King, Lords and Commons, with the whole Court, if there was occa&s;ion; and once they did enter|tain King Ch rles I. with his whole Court,
<PB REF="412">
and with the A&s;&s;embly of Peers, be&s;ides a va&s;t Confluence of the Gentry from all Parts to the King, and at the &s;ame time a great Part of his Army.</P>
<P>We went out in a double Excur&s;ion from this City, fir&s;t to &s;ee the Duke of Leeds's Hou&s;e, and then the Earl of Car|li&s;le's and the Earl of Burlington's in the Ea&s;t Riding; Carli&s;le Hou&s;e is by far the fine&s;t De&s;ign, but it is not fini&s;hed, and may not, perhaps, in our Time; they &s;ay his Lord&s;hip &s;ometimes ob&s;erves Noblemen &s;hould only De&s;ign, and begin great Palaces, and leave Po&s;terity to fin|i&s;h them gradually, as their E&s;tates will allow them; it is called Ca&s;tle Howard. The Earl of Burlington's is an old built Hou&s;e, but &s;tands deliciou&s;ly, and has a noble Pro&s;pect towards the Humber, as al&s;o toward the Would.</P>
<P>At Hambledon Down, near this City, are once a Year very great Races&punc; ap|pointed for the Entertainment of the Gen|try, and they are the more frequented, becau&s;e the King's Plate of a hundred Guincas is always run for there once a Year; a Gift de&s;igned to encourage the Gentlemen to breed good Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>York&s;hire is throng'd with Curio&s;ities&punc; and two or three con&s;tantly attend the&s;e Races, namely, Fir&s;t, That (as all Hor&s;e Matches do) it brings together abundance of Noblemen and Gentlemen of Di&s;tinc|tion, and a proportion of Ladies; and, I a&s;&s;ure you, the la&s;t make a very noble Appearance here, and if I may &s;peak my Thoughts without flattery, take the like Number where you will, yet, in &s;pite of the pretended Reproach of Country breeding, the Ladies of the North are as hand&s;ome and as well dre&s;s'd as are to be &s;een either at the Court or at the Ball.</P>
<P>From York we did not jump at once over the whole Country, and, like a late Author, without taking notice of any Thing, come out again &s;ixty or &s;eventy Miles off, like an Apparition, without be|ing &s;een by the way. The fir&s;t thing we did, we took a View of the Suburb of York over the River, oppo&s;ite to the Ci|ty, and then entring the Ea&s;t Riding, took our Audience de Conge in form, and &s;o &s;tood over that Divi&s;ion towards Hull</P>
<P>In our Road we had a clear View of the Earl of Burlington's noble and magni|ficent Hou&s;e, mentioned ju&s;t now, $word$ after our pa&s;&s;ing the River Derwent&punc; on a very high ri&s;ing Ground, very advantage|ou&s;ly &s;ituated.</P>
<P>The River Derwent, contrary to the Cour&s;e of all the Rivers in York&s;hire, (as I have ob&s;erved) runs North and South, ri&s;ing in that Part of the Country called Cleveland, and running through, or hard by, &s;everal Market Towns, as $word$ Pocklington, North Malton, and others, and is, by the Cour&s;e, a good guide to tho&s;e who would take a View of the whole Country.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved the middle of this $word$ or Divi&s;ion of York&s;hire is very thin of Towns, and con&s;equently of People, be|ing over&s;pread with Woulds, that is to &s;ay, Plains and Downs, like th$&s;e of Salisbury; on which they feed great Num|bers of Sheep, and breed al&s;o a great $$|ny Black Cattle and Hor&s;es; e&s;pecially $word$ the Northern Part, which runs $word$ Mountainous, and makes Part of the North Riding of York. But the Ea&s;t a$d We&s;t Part is populous and rich, and fall $word$ Towns, the one lying on the Sea $word$ and the other upon the River $word$ as above; the Sea Coa&s;t or We&s;t $word$ call'd Holderne&s;s.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing the Derwent we &s;aw $word$ of moment, but keeping under the Woulds or Hills mentioned above, we came to your old Acquaintance John a Beverley, I mean the famous Mona&s;tery at that Town.</P>
<P>It is a large and populous Town, tho' I find no con&s;iderable Manufacture carried on there. The great Collegiate Church is the main Thing which ever did, and &s;till does, make the Town in the World. The famous Story of John of Bev$rley, is, in &s;hort, this; That one John, Arch|bi&s;hop of York, a learned and devou$ Man, out of me$r pious Zeal for Reli|gion, and Contempt of the World, quit|ted or renounced his Honours and Superi|ority

<P>This Story will prompt you to en|quire how long ago 'twas, for you know as well as $, and will naturally ob&s;erve, that very few &s;uch Bi&s;hops are to be found $word$ it was indeed a long time ago, for $word$ $his very Year ju&s;t five Year above a thou&s;and Year ago that this happened; $$r the good Man died Anno Dom. 721. $word$ may &s;oon ca&s;t up the re&s;t to 1726.</P>

<P>However, King Athel&s;tan, after making $word$ to him if he got the Victory over $word$ Danes, made him his Tutclar Saint, $word$ gave great Gifts and Immunities to $word$ Place on his Account; among the $word$ the King granted his Peace to it, $word$ was the Word in tho&s;e Days; that is $word$ &s;ay, made it a Sanctuary, as he did $word$ about the &s;ame time to the Church $span$ and I &s;hall here give you the $span$ his Grant in the old Engli&s;h $word$ as I did of the other.</P>

<P>The Min&s;ter here is a very fair and neat Structure; the Roof is an Arch of Stone in it there are &s;everal Monuments of the Piercy's, Earls of Northumber|land, who have added a little Chapel to the Choir, in the Windows of which are the Pic|tures of &s;everal of that Family drawn in the Gla&s;s at the upper end of the Choir.

<P>Near the Min&s;ter on the South Side of it, is a place nam'd Hull Garth, wherein they keep a Court of Record, called the Provo&s;t's Court. In this may be try'd Cau&s;es for any Sum ari&s;ing within its Li|berties; (which are very large, having a|bout a hundred Towns and Parts of Towns in Holderne&s;s, and other Places of the la&s;t Riding belonging to it. It is &s;aid to have al$o a Power in criminal Mat|ters, though at pre&s;ent that is not u&s;ed.</P>
<P>But to come to the pre&s;ent Condition of the Town, it is above a Mile in length being of late much improv'd in its Build|ings, and has plea&s;ant Springs running quite through its Streets. It is more e|&s;pecially beautified with two &s;tately Churhces, and has a Free-School that is improved by two Fellow&s;hips, &s;ix Scho+lar&s;hips, and three Exibitions in St. $word$ College in Cambridge, belonging to $word$ be&s;ides &s;ix Alms Hou&s;es, the large&s;t wh$r$ of was built lately by the Executors $word$ Michael Warton, E&s;q; who, by his $word$ Will, left one thou&s;and Pound for $word$ U&s;e; the Mayor and Aldermen having &s;ometimes been deceived in their Choic$ admit none into their Alms-Hou&s;es $word$ &s;uch as will give Bond to leave their Ef|fects to the Poor when they die; a $word$ Example to other Places.</P>

<P>$word$ have &s;everal Fairs, but one $word$ e&s;pecially remarkable, called the Ma$t, be $word$ about nine Days before $word$ Day, and kept in a Street leading to th$ Min&s;ter Garth, called Londoners-Street for then the Londoners bring down th$$ Wares, and furni&s;h the Country Trade&s;|men by Whole&s;ale.</P>
<P>About a Mile from Beverly to the Ea&s;t in a Pa&s;ture belonging to the Town $word$ kind of Spaw, though they &s;ay it cannot be judg'd by the Ta&s;te whether or $word$ comes from any Mineral; yet taken $$|wardly it is a great Drier, and wa&s;h'd $word$ dries &s;corbutick Scurf, and all &s;orts of Scabs, and al&s;o very much helps the King's Evil.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ie to conceive how Beverly be|came a Town from this very $word$ namely, that all the Thieves, Murther|ers, Hou&s;e breakers, and Bankrupts, fl$$ hither for Protection; and here they ob|tained Safety from the Law whatever their Crimes might be.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, the Town growing bigger and bigger, the Church was $word$ enlarged; and though it fell into the
<PB REF="415">
King's Hands, King Henry VIII. having done by this as he did by others; and the Monks of Beverley were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, yet the Town continues a large, populous Town; and the River Hull is made na|vigable to it for the convenience of Trade.</P>
<P>I remember, &s;oon after the Revolution, when the late King William hired &s;ix thou&s;and Dani&s;h Auxiliaries to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his Wars in Ireland, they landed at Hull, and, marching from thence for We&s;t-Che&s;ter, in order to embark for Carrick|f$rgus, they came thro' this Town, and halted here a few Days for Refre&s;hment: Here two of their Foot Soldiers quarrel|led and &s;ought a Duel, in which one of them was kill'd. The other being taken, was immediately tried and &s;entenced by a Court Mar&s;hal of their own Officers, and by the Rules of War, &s;uch as were in force among them, was &s;entenced and put to Death, and was then buried in the &s;ame Grave with the Man he had kill'd; and upon their Grave is &s;et up a Stone with an Engli&s;h In&s;cription thus&punc;</P>
<P>Under this Stone two Dani&s;h Soldiers lie.</P>
<P>There are other Lines mentioning the Story, as above, but I do not remember them, it being &s;ome Years &s;ince I made this Ob&s;ervation. But to return to St. John of Beverley, and King Athel&s;tan's merry Grant, which I &s;hall make &s;peak Engli&s;h as well as I can; it is as follows:</P>

<P>From Beverley I came to Hull, di&s;tance &s;ix Miles. If you would expect me to g$$e an Account of the City of Ham|b$rgh or Dantzick, or Rotterdam, or any of the &s;econd Rate Cities abroad, which ate fam'd for their Commerce, the Town of Hull may be a &s;pecimen. The Place is indeed not &s;o large as tho&s;e; but, in proportion to the Dimen&s;ions of it, I believe there is more Bu&s;ine&s;s done in Hull than in any Town of its bigne&s;s in Europe; Leverpool indeed of late comes after it apace; but then Lever|pool has not the London Trade to add to it.</P>
<P>In the late War, the Fleets from Hull to London were frequently a hundred Sad, &s;ometimes including the other Creeks in the Humber, a hundred and fifty to a hundred and &s;ixty Sail at a Time; and to Holland their Trade is &s;o con&s;iderable, that the Dutch always employ'd two Men of War to fetch and carry, that is, to convoy the Trade, as they called it, to and from Hull, which was as many as they did to London.</P>
<P>In a Word, all the Trade at Leeds, Wakefield and Halli$ax, of which I have &s;poken &s;o ju&s;tly and &s;o largely, is tran|&s;acted here, and the Goods are &s;hipped here by the Merchants of Hull; all the Lead Trade of Derby&s;hire and Notting|ham&s;hire, from Beautry Wharf, the But|ter of the Ea&s;t and North Riding, brought down the Ou&s;e to York: The Chee&s;e brought down the Trent from Stafford, Warwick and Che&s;hire, and the Corn from all the Counties adjacent, are brought down and &s;hipped off here.</P>
<P>And, they &s;upply all the&s;e Countries in return with foreign Goods of all kinds, for which they Trade to all Parts of the known World; nor have the Merchants of any Port in Britain a fairer Credit, or fairer Character, than the Merchants of Hull, as well for the Ju&s;tice of their Dealings as the Greatne&s;s of their &s;ub|&s;tance or Funds for Trade. They drive a great Trade here to Norway, and to to the Baltick, and an important Trade here to Dantzick, Riga, Narva and Pe|tersburgh; from whence they make large Returns in Iron, Copper, Hemp, Flax, Canvas, Pot-A&s;hes, Mu&s;covy Linnen and Yarn, and other Things; all which they
<PB REF="418">
get vent for in the Country to an ex|ceeding Quantity. They have al&s;o a great Importation of Wine, Linen, Oil, Fruit, &amp;c. trading to Holland, France and Spain; the Trade of Tobacco and Su|gars from the We&s;t Indies, they chiefly manage by the Way of London. But be|&s;ides all this, their Export of Corn, as well to London as to Holland and France, exceeds all of the kind, that is or can be do$e at any Port in England, London excepted.</P>
<P>Their Shipping is a great Article in which they outdo all the Towns and Ports on the Coa&s;t except Ya$mouth, only that thei$ &s;h$pping con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in &s;maller Ve&s;&s;e$ls than the C$al Trade is &s;uppl$$d with, $ho' they have a $word$ ma$y l$$ge Ve&s;&s;els too, which are employed in their foreign Trade.</P>
<P>The Town is &s;ituated at the Mouth of the River Hull, where it fills into the Humber, and where the Humber opens in$o the German Ocean, &s;o that one S$de of their Town lies upon the Sea, the o+ther upon the Land. This makes the Si|tuation naturally very &s;trong; and were there any occa&s;ion, it is capable of be|ing&punc; made impregnable, by rea&s;on of the low Situation of the Grounds round it.</P>
<P>King Charles II. on occa&s;ion of the fi$$|quent Dutch Wars in that Reign, had once re&s;olved to appoint a Station for a Squadron of Men of War here; with a Yard and Dock, for building Men of War (Ships) in the Humber; and, on this oc|ca&s;ion, re&s;olved to make the Place &s;trong, in proportion to the Nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e Affairs; upon which a large Citadel was marked out on the other Side the River; but it was never fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t imperfection, as to the &s;trength of Hull in Ca&s;e of a War, is, that, lying open to the Sea, it is liable to a Bombardment; which can only be pre|vented by being Ma&s;ters at Sea, and while we are &s;o, there's no need of Fortificati|ons at all; and &s;o there's an end of Argu|ment upon that Subject.</P>
<P>The Town is exceeding clo&s;e $span$ &s;hould a Fire ever be its Fate, it might &s;uffer deeply on that Account; 'tis ex|traordinary populous, even to an incon|venience, having really no room to ex|tend it &s;elf by Buildings. There are $$t two Churches, but one of them is very large, and there are two or $word$ very large Meeting hou&s;es, and a Market $lor|ed with an infinite plenty of all So$ts of Provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>They &s;hew us &s;till in their Town hall the Figure of a Northern Fi&s;herman, &s;up|po&s;ed to be of Groenla$d, that is to &s;ay, the real Greenland, being the Conti$ent of America to the North of tho&s;e we call the North We&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages; not of S$$lt|bergen where our Ships go a Wha$$ $word$ and which is, by mi&s;ta$e, c$$l$d Greenland. He was taken up at S$a in a Leather Boat&punc; which he &s;ate in, and was covered with Skins, which drew together about his Wa&s;te, &s;o that the $word$ could n$t fill, and he could not &s;ink; the $word$ would never feed nor $word$ and $o died.</P>
<P>They have a very hand&s;ome Exchange here, where the Merchants meet as $t London, and, I a&s;&s;ure you, it is wonder|fully fi led and that with a Confluence of real Merchants, and many Foreigners, and &s;everal from the Count$y; for the Navigation of all the great Rivers which fall into the Humber centers here &s;uch as the Trent, the Idle, the Don, the $word$ and Calder, and the Ou&s;e; and $word$ the Commerce of all the great Towns on tho&s;e Rivers is managed here, from Gainsborough and No$tingham on the Trent, York and Selby on the Ou&s;e, and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a fine Free School, over which is the Merchant's Hall. But the Trinity-hou&s;e here is the Glory of the Town: It is a Corporation of it&s;elf, made up of a Society of Merchants: It was begun by voluntary Contribution for Re|lief of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and aged Seamen, and their Wives or Widows; but was after|wards approved by the Government, and
<PB REF="419">

<P>They maintain thirty Si&s;ters now actu|ally in the Hou&s;e, Widows of Seamen; they have a Government by twelve Elder Brethren and &s;ix A&s;&s;i&s;tants; out of the 12 they chu&s;e annually two Wardens, but the whole eighteen vote in electing them, $word$ two Stewards.

<P>They have a noble Stone Bridge here over the River Hull&punc; con&s;i&s;ting of four|teen Arches. They had once &s;et up a Greenland Fi&s;hery&punc; and it went on with &s;ucce&s;s for a time; but it decayed in the time when the Dutch Wars were &s;o fre|quent, and the Hou&s;e built by the Green|land Merchants is now turned into Gra|naries for Corn, and Warehou&s;es for other Goods</P>
<P>The old Ho&s;pital, call'd God's Hou&s;e, &s;tands near it, with a Chapel rebuilt &s;ince the late War, and the Arms of Michael de la Pole, the fir&s;t Founder, &s;et up again; &s;o that the Foundation is re&s;tored, the Building is nobly enlarged, and an entire new Ho&s;pital built as an addition to the old one. The Story of this De la Pole may not be unwelcome, becau&s;e, though it be a Piece of Antiquity, 'tis a Piece of Honour both to the Merchants of Hull, and to the Town it &s;elf. Sir Michael de la Pole was a Merchant of Hull, but fir&s;t at a Place called Raven's Rood in Brabant, where, growing rich, he advanced to King Richard II. &s;everal thou&s;and Pounds in Gold for his urgent Occa&s;ions in his Wars; upon which the King invited him to come and live in England, which he did; here the King knighted him, and made his Son, Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, gave him &s;everal Lord&s;hips in Holderne&s;s; and Mr. Cambden ob&s;erves, he is &s;tiled by the King in tho&s;e Grants, William de la Pole, Dilectus Valectus &amp; Mercator No&s;ter, &s;o that he was called the King's Merchant.</P>
<P>This De la Pole founded a Mona&s;try of Carthu&s;ians, and an Ho&s;pital, which, when that was &s;uppre&s;s'd, remained; and this they call God's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Farther Ea&s;t from $word$ there is a little plea&s;ant Town called $$$don, hand&s;ome, $span$ and having a little Haven from $span$ threatens Hull, that it $span$ to be a great Place, $span$ ca&s;es dai y; but I fear $span$ their Haven will do $span$ for them, unle&s;s they $span$ very con&s;iderable for $word$</P>
<P>They tell us at Headon, that the Sea encroaches upon the Land on all that Sh$$e, and that there are many large Field qui e eaten up; that &s;everal Towns were formerly known to be there, which are now lo&s;t; from whence they may &s;up|po&s;e, that as the Sea by Encroachment has damnified their Harbour, &s;o if it grows upon them a little more they &s;hall &s;tand open to the Sea, and &s;o need no Harbour at all, or make a Mole, as 'tis called a|broad, and have a good Road without it. But this is a View &s;omething remote.</P>
<P>The Spurn Head, a long Promontory thru&s;ting out into the Sea, and making the North Point of Humber, is a remarkable thing. But I leave that to the De&s;cripti|on of the Sea Coa&s;ts, whch is none of my Work; the mo&s;t that I find remark|able here, is, that there is nothing re|markable upon this &s;ide for above thirty Miles together; not a Port, nor a Gentl|man's Seat, not a Town of Note; Brid+lington or Burlington is the only Place, and that is of no note, only for a Bay or Road for &s;hipping, which is of u&s;e to the Colliers on this Coa&s;t to defend them, in Ca&s;e of Extremity of Weather.</P>
<P>The Country People told us a long Story here of Gip&s;ies which vi&s;it them often in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner. We were &s;trangely amu&s;ed with their Di&s;cour&s;es at
<PB REF="420">
fir&s;t, forming our Ideas from the Word, which, in ordinary import with us, &s;igni|fies a &s;ort of &s;trolling, Fortune-telling, Hen roo&s;t-robbing, Pocket-picking Vaga|bonds, called by that Name. But we were &s;oon made to under&s;tand the Peo+ple, as they under&s;tood them&s;elves here, namely, that at &s;ome certain Sea&s;ons, for none knows when it will happen, &s;everal Streams of Water, &s;hu&s;h out of the Earth with great Violence, &s;pouting up a huge heighth, being really natural Jette d'caus or Fountains, that they make a great Noi&s;e, and, joining together, form little Rivers, and &s;o ha&s;ten to the Sea, I had not time to examine into the Particulars; and as the irruption was not ju&s;t then to be &s;een, we could &s;ay little to it: That which was mo&s;t ob&s;ervable to us, was, that the Coun|try People have a Notion that whenever tho&s;e Gip&s;ies, or, as &s;ome call em', Vip|&s;eys, break out, there will certainly en&s;ue either Famine or Plague. This put me in mind, that the very &s;ame thing is &s;aid to happen at Smitham Bottom in Surrey, beyond Croydon, on the Road to Rye|gate, fills the whole Bottom, and makes a large River running ju&s;t to the Towns End of Croydon; and then turning to the Left runs into the River which ri&s;es in the Town, and runs to Ca&s;halton; and I name it, becau&s;e the Country People here have exactly the &s;ame Notion, that this Water never breaks out but again&s;t a Famine; and as I am &s;ure it has not now broken out for more than fifty Years, it may, for ought I know, be true.</P>
<P>Scarborough next pre&s;ents it&s;elf, a place formerly famous for the &s;trong Ca|&s;tle, &s;ituate on a Rock, as it were hang|ing over the Sea, but now demoli&s;h'd, being ruined in the la&s;t wars. The Town is well built, populous and plea|&s;ant, and we found a great deal of good Company here drinking the Waters, who came not only from the North of Eng|land, but even from all the North of Scot|land. It is hard to de&s;cribe the Ta&s;te of the Waters; they are apparently ting'd with a collection of mineral Salts, as of Vitriol, allom, Iron, and perhaps Sul|phur, and ta&s;te evidently of the allom. Here is &s;uch a plenty of all &s;orts of l$&s;h that I have hardly &s;een the like, and in particular, here we &s;aw Turbets of three quarters of a hundred Weight, and yet their Fle&s;h eat exceeding find when taken new.</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe the Herring, the Ma$k|rel, the Cod, the Whiting, is only to repeat what is &s;aid in other Places and what we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to $ep$$t more than any once, now we began to go far North.</P>

<P>From hence the North Riding hol$s on the Bank of Tees, the Northern $word$ of York&s;hire, and where the$e are $word$ good Towns, (viz.) Stockton and Y$|rum, Towns of no great note; but $word$ they obtain by the River and the a$$|cent Sea, but&punc; are greatly encrea&s;ed of late Years, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t by be $g the chiefe&s;t Place in the North $span$ York, or in the County of Cumberla$d&punc; for the &s;hipping off Lead, and $span$ London.</P>
<P>I began now to con&s;ider the $word$ Journey I had to go, and that I $span$ &s;top at &s;mall Matters: We west $word$ Stockton to Durham, North $span$ a Town on the Po&s;t Road, $span$ for the va&s;t Quantity of Black $span$ there, there being a Fair once every F$$t|night for &s;ome Months, where a prod gi|ous Quantity are &s;old.</P>
<P>I have not concern'd this Work at $word$ on the Debate among us in England&punc; $word$ to Whig and Tory. But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve of this Town, that, except a few Qua|kers, they boa&s;ted that they had not one Di&s;&s;enter here, and yet at the &s;ame time not one Tory, which is what, I believe
<PB REF="421">
$annot be &s;aid of any other Town in $reat Britain.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now leave York&s;hire, which $deed I might more fully have de&s;cribed, $word$ I had had time; for there are abun|$$nce of Rarities in Nature &s;poken of in $word$ North Riding, which I had not $word$ to enquire into; as the Allom Mines $span$ near Moultgrave or Mu&s;grave, $word$ whence the Lord Mu&s;grave, now $k$ of Buckingham&s;hire, has his Title, he has al&s;o a great Part of his E&s;tate $word$ the Allom Works not far off. Next $word$ are the Snake Stones, of which no|$$g can be &s;aid but as one ob&s;erves of $m, to &s;ee how Nature &s;ports her &s;elf am $e us, as if Snakes could grow in $word$ Stones. Then the Glates or $word$ that is, in &s;hort Jett, a black &s;mooth $word$ &s;ound in Cleveland; al&s;o a Peice $word$ which, if the wild Gee&s;e $word$ to fly over, they fall down dead $word$ $$$not dwell any longer here.</P>

As to the $word$ Kettles, &s;o much talked up for a $$der, which are to be &s;een as we ride $word$ the Tees to Darlington, I had $word$ $$en &s;o little of Wonder in &s;uch $word$ Tales, that I was not ha&s;tily $word$ again 'Tis evident, they are $word$ but old Coal-Pits filled with Water $word$ River Tees.</P>
<P>urham is next, a little compact neat|$ntriv'd City, &s;urrounded almo&s;t with River Wear, which with the Ca&s;tle $word$ on an eminence, enclo&s;es the in the middle of it; as the Ca&s;tle al&s;o the Cathedral, the Bi&s;hop's $word$ and the fine Hou&s;es of the Clergy, $word$ they live in all the Magnificence $plendor imaginable.</P>
<P>$eed not tell you, that the Bi&s;hop urham is a Temporal Prince, that $eps a Court of Equity, and al&s;o $s of Ju&s;tice in ordinary Cau&s;es with|in him&s;elf. The County of Durham, like the Country about Rome, is called St. Cuthbert's Patrimony. This Church, they tell us, was founded by David, King of Scots; and afterward Zouch, the va|liant Bi&s;hop, fought the Scots Army at Nevil's Cro&s;s, where the Scots were ter|ribly cut in Pieces, and their King taken Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>But what do I dip into Antiquity for, here, which I have avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible every where el&s;e. The Church of Durham is eminent for its Wealth&punc; the Bi&s;hoprick is e&s;teemed the be&s;t in England; and the Prebends and other Church Livings, in the Gift of the Bi|&s;hop, are the riche&s;t in England&punc; They told me there, that the Bi&s;hop had thir|teen Livings in his Gift&punc; from five hun|dred Pounds a Year to thirteen hundred Pounds a Year; and the Living of the little Town of Sedgfield, a few Miles South of the City, is &s;aid to be worth twelve hundred Pounds a Year, be&s;ide the &s;mall Tithes, which maintain a Curate, or might do &s;o.</P>
<P>Going to &s;ee the Church of Durham, they &s;hewed us the old Popi&s;h Ve&s;tments of the Clergy before the Reformation, and which, $n high Days, &s;ome of the Re&s;idents put on &s;till. They are &s;o rich with embroidery and embo&s;s'd work of Silver, that indeed it was a kind of a Load to &s;tand under them.</P>
<P>The Town is well built but old, full of Roman Catholicks, who live peaceably and di&s;turb no Body, and no Body them; for we being there on a Holiday, &s;aw them going as publickly to Ma&s;s as the Di&s;&s;en|ters did on other Days to their Meeting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>From hence we kept the common Road to Che&s;ter in the Street, an old, dirty, thorowfare Town, empty of all Remains of the Greatne&s;s which Antiquaries &s;ay it once had, when it was a Roman Colony. Here is a Stone Bridge, but in&s;tead of rid|ing over it we rode under it, and riding up the Stream pa&s;s'd under or through one of the Arches, not being over the Hor&s;es Hoofs
<PB REF="422">
in Water; yet, on enquiry, we found, that &s;ometimes they have u&s;e enough for a Bridge</P>
<P>Here we had an Account of a melan|choly Accident, and in it &s;elf &s;trange al|&s;o, which happened in or near Lumley Park, not long before we pa&s;s'd through the Town. A new Coal Pit being dug or digging, the Workmen workt on in the Vein of Coals till they came to a Cavity, which, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, had for|merly been dug from &s;ome other Pit; but be it what it will&punc; as &s;oon as upon the breaking into the hollow Part, the pent up Air got vent&punc; it blew up like a Mine of a thou&s;and Barrels of Powder, and, getting Vent at the Shaft of the Pit, bur&s;t out with &s;uch a terrible Noi&s;e, as made the very Earth tremble for &s;ome Miles round, and terrify d the whole Country. There were near three&s;core poor People lo&s;t their Lives in the Pit, and one or two, as we were told, who were at the bottom of the Shaft, were blown quite out, though &s;ixty Fathom deep, and were found dead upon the Ground.</P>
<P>Lundey Ca&s;tle is ju&s;t on the Side of the Road as you pa&s;s between Durham and Che&s;ter, plea&s;antly &s;eated in a fine Park, and on the Bank of the River Were. The Park, be&s;ides the plea&s;antne&s;s of it, has this much better thing to recommend it, namely, that it is full of excellent Veins of the be&s;t Coal in the Country, (for the Lumley Coal are known for their Goodne&s;s at London&punc; as well as there.) This, with the navigable River ju&s;t at hand, by which the Coals are carrid down to Sunderland to the Ships, makes Lumley Park an inexhau&s;tible Trea&s;ure to the Fa|mily.</P>
<P>They tell us, that King James the Fir&s;t lodg'd in this Ca&s;tle, at his entrance into England to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown, and &s;eeing a fine Picture of the antient Pedigree of the Family, which carrid it very far beyond what his Maje&s;ty thought credible, turn'd this good Je&s;t upon it to the Bi&s;hop of Durham, who &s;hewed it him, viz. That indeed he did not $word$ that Adam's Sirname was Lumley $word$ fore.</P>
<P>From hence the Road to $word$ gives a View of the inexhau&s;ted $word$ Coals and Coal Pits, from $span$ London only, but all the South Part $word$ England is continually &s;upplied; $word$ when we are at London, $span$ the prodigious Fleets of Ships $word$ come con&s;tantly in with Coals for $span$ crea&s;ing City, we are apt to $word$ whence they come, and that they $word$ bring the whole Country away; $span$ the contrary, when in this Country $word$ &s;ee the prodigious Heaps, I $span$ Mountains, of Coals, which are $span$ at every Pit, and ho$ many of th$ $span$ there are; we are filled with $span$ to con&s;ider where the People $word$ live that can con&s;ume them.</P>
<P>Newca&s;tle is a &s;pacious, $span$ finitely populous Place; 'tis $span$ the River Tyne, which is here $span$ large and deep River, and $span$ rea&s;onable Burthen may come $span$ the very Town. As the Town $span$ both Sides the River, the Parts are $word$ by a very &s;trong and &s;tately Store $word$ of &s;even very great Arches, $span$ than the Arches of London $span$ the Bridge is built into a Street of $word$ al&s;o, as London Bridge is</P>
<P>The Town it &s;elf or Liberty, $span$ Corporation, extends but to $span$ Bridge, where there is a $span$ all of Stone, not much $span$ London Bridge, which $span$ &s;afeguard to the whole $span$ a terrible Fire which $span$ endangered burning the whole $word$ Hou&s;es on the City Side of $span$ it did tho&s;e beyond it.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a very noble $word$ here, called the Exchange: And as Wall of the Town runs parallel fro$ with the River, leaving a &s;pacious $word$ of Ground before it between the $word$ and the Wall, that Ground, being $word$ Wharf'd up, and fac'd with $word$
<PB REF="423">
makes the longe&s;t and large&s;t Key for landing and lading Goods that is to be &s;een in England, except that at Yarmouth in Nor&s;ol's, and much longer than that at Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>Here is a large Ho&s;pital built by Con|tribution of the Keel Men, by way of friendly Society, for the Maintenance of the Poor of their Fraternity, and which, had it not met with Di&s;couragements from tho&s;e who ought rather to have a&s;|&s;i&s;ted &s;o good a Work, might have been a noble Provi&s;ion for that numerous and $aborious People. The Keel Men are tho&s;e who manage the Lighters, which they call Keels, by which the Coals are taken from the Steaths or Wharfs, and carried ou board the Ships, to load them for London.</P>
<P>Here are &s;everal large publick Build|ings al&s;o, as particularly a Hou&s;e of State for the Mayor of the Town (for the Time being) to remove to, and dwell in during his Year: Al&s;o here is a H$$l for the Surgeons, where they meet, where they have two Skeletons of humane Bo|dies, one a Man and the other a Woman, and &s;ome other Rarities.</P>
<P>The Situation of the Town to the Landward is exceeding unplea&s;ant, and the Buildings very clo&s;e and old, &s;tanding on the Declivity of two exceeding high Hills, which, together with the Smoke of the Coals, makes it not the plea&s;ante&s;t Place in the World to live in; but it is made amends abundantly by the Goodne&s;s of the River, which runs between the two Hills, and which as I &s;aid, bringing Ships up to the very Keys, and fetching
the Coals down from the Country, makes it a Place of very great Bu&s;ine&s;s. Here are al&s;o two Articles of Trade which are par|ticularly occa&s;ioned by the Coals, and the&s;e are Gla&s;s-hou&s;es and Salt Pans; the fir&s;t are at the Town it &s;elf, the la&s;t are at Shields, &s;even Miles below the Town; but their Coals are brought chiefly from the Town. It is a prodigious Quantity of Coals which tho&s;e Salt Works con&s;ume; and the Fires make &s;uch a Smoke, that we &s;aw it a&s;cend in Clouds over the Hills, four Miles before we came to Dur|ham, which is at lea&s;t &s;ixteen Miles from the Place.</P>
<P>Here I met with a Remark which was quite new to me, and will be &s;o, I &s;up|po&s;e, to tho&s;e that hear it. You well know, we receive at London every Year a great Quantity of Salmon pickled or cured, and &s;ent up in the Pickle in Kits or Tubs, which we call Newca&s;tle Sal|mon; now when I came to Newca&s;tle, I expected to &s;ee a mighty plenty of Sal|mon there, but was &s;urprized to find, on the contrary, that there was no great Quantity, and that a good large fre&s;h Salmon was not to be had under five or &s;ix S$$$ings Upon enquiry I found, that really this Salmon, that we call Now|ca&s;tle Salmon, is taken as far off as the Tweed, which is three&s;core Miles, and is brought by Land on Hor&s;es to Shields, where it is cur'd, pickl'd, and &s;ent to London, as above; &s;o that it ought to be called Berwick Salmon, not New|ca&s;tle</P>
<P>There are five or &s;ix Churches in New|ca&s;tle, I mean on the Town &s;ide, being North by Time, be&s;ides Meeting-hou&s;es, of which, I was told, there are al&s;o five or &s;ix, (including the Quakers) &s;ome of which are throng'd with Multitudes of People, the Place, as has been &s;aid, being exceeding populous. It is not only en|riched by the Coal Trade; but there are al&s;o very con&s;iderable Merchants in it who carry on foreign Trade to divers Parts of the World, e&s;pecially to Holland, Hamburgh, Norway, and the Baltick.</P>
<P>They build Ships here to Perfection, I mean as to Strength and Firmne&s;s, and to bear the Sea; and as the Coal Trade oc|ca&s;ions a Demand for &s;uch &s;trong Ships, a great many are built here. This gives an Addition to the Merchants Bu&s;ine&s;s, in requiring a Supply of all &s;orts of naval Stores to fit out tho&s;e Ships.</P>
<P>Here is al&s;o a con&s;iderable Manufacture of Hard Ware, or Wrought Iron, lately erected after the Manner of Sheffield,
<PB REF="424">
which is very helpful for employing the Poor, of which this Town has always a prodigious Number.</P>
<P>We&s;t of this Town lies the Town of Hexham, a Pa&s;s upon the Tine, famous, or indeed infamous, for having the fir&s;t Blood drawn at it, in the War again&s;t their Prince by the Scots in King Charles the Fir&s;t's time, and where a &s;trong Detach|ment of Engli&s;h, tho' advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, were &s;candalou&s;ly defeated by the Scots. Whether the Commanders were in fault, or the Men, I know not, but they gave way to an inferior Number of Scots, who gain'd the Pa&s;s, fought through the River, and killed about four hundred Men, the re&s;t ba&s;ely running away; af|ter which, the Town of Newca&s;tle was as ea&s;ily quitted al&s;o, without &s;triking a Stroke; the Country round this Town is vulgarly call'd Hexam&s;hire.</P>
<P>I was tempted greatly here to trace the famous Picts Wall, built by the Romans, or rather rebuilt by them, from hence to Carli&s;le; of the Particulars of which, and the Remains of Antiquity &s;een upon it, all our Hi&s;tories are &s;o full; and I did go to &s;everal Places in the Fields thro' which it pa&s;&s;ed, where I &s;aw the Re|mains of it, &s;ome almo&s;t lo&s;t, &s;ome plain to be &s;een. But Antiquity not being my bu&s;ine&s;s in this Work, I omitted the Journey, and went on for the North.</P>
<P>Northumberland is a long coa&s;ting Coun|ty, lying chiefly on the Sea to the Ea&s;t, and bounded by the Mountains of Stain|more and Cheviot on the We&s;t, which are in &s;ome Places inacco&s;&s;ible, in many unpa&s;&s;able&punc; Here is abundant Bu&s;ine&s;s for an Antiquary; every Place &s;hews you ruin'd Ca&s;tles, Roman Altars, in|&s;criptions, Monuments of the Battles of Heroes killed, and Armies routed, and the like: The Towns of Morpeth, Aln|wick, Warkworth, Tickell, and many others, &s;hew their old Ca&s;tles, and &s;ome of them &s;till in tolerable repair, as Aln|wick in particular, and Warkworth; others, as Bambrough, Norham, Chillingham, Hor|ton, Dun&s;tar, Wark, and innumerable more, are &s;unk in their own ruins&punc; by the meet length of Time.</P>
<P>We had Cheviot Hills &s;o plain in View, that we could not but enquire of the good old Women every whe|ther they had heard of the Fight at chary They not only told us they $d heard of it, but had all the Account of it at their Fingers end; and, taking a Guide at Wooller to &s;hew us the Road he pointed out di&s;tinctly to us the very Spot where the Engagement was, h$$, he &s;aid, Earl Piercy was killed and there Earl Dougla&s;s, here Sir William Wathing|ton &s;ought upon his Stumps, here the Engli&s;hmen that were &s;lain were buried, and there the Scots.</P>
<P>A little way off this North, he &s;hewed us the Field of Battle, called Flodden Fiel$, upon the Barks of the Till, where James V. King of Scotland, de&s;perately fighting, was killed, and his whole Ar|my overthrown by the Engli&s;h, under the noble and gallant Earl of Surrey, in the Reign of King Henry VIII. upon their per&s;idiou&s;ly invading England, while the King was ab&s;ent on his Wars in France.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not quit Northumberland with|out taking notice, that the Natives of this Country, of the antient original Race or Families, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a Slab|boleth upon their Tongues, namely, a difficulty in pronouncing the $span$ which they cannot deliver from $word$ Tongues without a hollow $$rring in the Throat by which they are $word$ known as a Foreigner is, in pronouncing the Th: This they call the $word$ R, and the Natives value $word$ upon that Imperfection, becau&s;e, $word$ it &s;hews the Antiquity of their Blood</P>

<P>I cannot but &s;ay, that &s;ince I entred on the View of the&s;e Northern Coun+s, I have many times repented that I early re&s;olved to decline the $word$ View of Antiquity, here being &s;o great $word$ &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a Variety, and every $word$ more and more di&s;covered; and $ndance &s;ince the Tour which the $ned Mr. Cambden made this Way, $word$ many &s;ince his Learned $word$, for as the Trophies, the Buildings, religious, as well as military Remains, $ell of the Britains, as of the Romans, ons, and Normans, are but, as we $word$ &s;ay, like Wounds ha&s;tily healed up, <HI>Calous</HI> &s;pread over them being re|$d, they appear pre&s;ently; and though $word$ which naturally eats into the $$e&s;t Stones, Metals, or whatever Sub&s;tance, &s;imple or compound, is or can be by Art or Nature prepared to en|dure it, has defaced the Surface, the Fi|gures and In&s;criptions upon mo&s;t of the&s;e Things, yet they are beautiful, even in their decay, and the venerable Face of Antiquity has &s;omething &s;o plea&s;ing, &s;o &s;urprizing, &s;o &s;atisfactory in it, e&s;pe|cially to tho&s;e who have with any Atten|tion read the Hi&s;tories of pa&s;s'd ages, that I know nothing renders Travelling more plea&s;ant and more agreeable.</P>
<P>But I have condemn'd my &s;elf (un|happily) to Silence upon this Head, and therefore, re&s;olving however to pay this Homage to the Du&s;t of gallant Men and glorious Nations. I &s;ay therefore, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit and go on; and as I re&s;olve once more to travel through all the&s;e North|ern Countries upon this very Errand, and to plea&s;e, nay, &s;atiate my&s;elf with a &s;trict Search into every thing that is curious in Nature and Antiquity. I mortify my &s;elf now with the more ca&s;e, in hopes of letting the World &s;ee, &s;ome time or other, that I have not &s;pent tho&s;e Hours in a vain and barren Search, or come back without a &s;ufficient Reward to all the Labours of a diligent Enquirer; but of this by the way. I mu&s;t, for the pre|&s;ent, make this Circuit &s;horter than u&s;ual, and leave the De&s;cription of the other Counties to my next.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY X.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus fini&s;hed my Ac|count of the Ea&s;t Side of the North Divi&s;ion of England, I put a &s;top here, that I may ob|&s;erve the exact Cour&s;e of my Travels; for as I do not write you the&s;e Letters from the Ob&s;ervations of one &s;ingle Jour|ney, &s;o I de&s;cribe Things as my Journies lead me, having no le&s;s than five times travelled through the North of England, and almo&s;t every time by a different Rout; purpo&s;ely that I might &s;ee every thing that was to be &s;een, and, if po&s;&s;ible, know every thing that is to be known, though not (at lea&s;t till the la&s;t general Journey) knowing or re&s;olving upon writing the&s;e Accounts to you. Now as by my exact Ob&s;ervations on all the&s;e &s;everal Traver&s;es of the Country, I hope I am not the le&s;s able, &s;o I am &s;ure I am much the better furni&s;hed, as well to tell you wherein others have ignorantly or &s;uperficially re|pre&s;ented Things, as to give you &s;uch other and fuller Accounts, as in your own intended Travels you will find confirmed, and by which you will be able the better to guide your father Enquires.</P>
<P>I entred Lanca&s;hire at tbe remote&s;t We&s;tern Point of that County, having been at We&s;t-Che&s;ter upon a particular Occa&s;ion, and from thence ferry'd over from the Ce&s;trian Cher&s;one&s;us, as I have already call'd it, to Liverpoole. This narrow Slip of Land, rich, fertile and full of Inhabitants, tho' formerly, as Authors &s;ay, a meer wa&s;te and de&s;olate Fore&s;t, is called Wirall, or by &s;ome Wi$$|hall. Here is a Ferry over the $word$ which, at full Sea, is more than two Miles over. We land on the flat Sher$ on the other Side, and are contented to ride through the Water for &s;ome length not on Hor&s;eback but on the Shoulders of &s;ome hone&s;t Lanca&s;hire Clown, who comes Knee deep to the Boat &s;ide, to tru&s;s you up, and then runs away with you, as nimbly as you de&s;ire to ride, $word$ unle&s;s his Trot were ea&s;ier; for I was &s;haken by him that I had the luck to be carry'd by more than I car'd for, and much wro&s;e than a hard trotting Hor&s;e would have &s;haken me.</P>
<P>Liverpoole is one of the Wonders $word$ Britain, and that more, in my Opinion than any of the Wonders of the Peak; the Town was, at my fir&s;t $span$ about the Year 1680, a large, hand&s;ome, well built and encrea&s;ing or $word$ Town; at my &s;econd Vi&s;it, $span$ it was much bigger than at my fir&s;t $word$ it, and, by the report of the $word$ more than twice as big as it was twenty Years before that; but, I think, I may &s;afely &s;ay at this my third &s;eeing it $word$ I was &s;urpriz'd at the View, it was more than double what it was at the $word$ and, I am told&punc; that it &s;till vi&s;ibly en|crea&s;es both in Wealth, People, Bu&s;ine&s;s and Building: What it may grow to in time, I know not.</P>
<P>There are no Fortifications either to Landward or Seaward, the Inhabitants
<PB REF="427">
re&s;ting &s;ecure under the Protection of the general Peace; though when the late Nor|thern In&s;urrection &s;pread down their Way, and came to Pre&s;ton, they could have been glad of Walls and Gates; and in|deed, had the Rebel Party had time to have advanced to Warrington, &s;eized the Pa&s;s there, and taken Manche&s;ter, as they would certainly have done in three Days more, it would have fared but very ill with Liverpoole; who could have but little Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t an arm'd and de&s;|perate Body of Men, &s;uch as they ap|peared to be, and by that time would have been: Be&s;ides, the Invaders would here have found not the Sweets of Plun|der and Lead, all which they extreamly wanted; they would have had Ships al&s;o to have facilitated a Communication with their Fellows in Ireland, who would have throng'd over upon the lea&s;t View of their Succe&s;s, if it had been only in hopes of Plunder.</P>
<P>But Heaven had Liverpoole in its par|ticular Protection, as well as the whole Kingdom; the Rebels were met with, &s;ought and defeated, before they got leave to get &s;o far, or to make any offer that Way. The Story of which, as it does not belong to this Work, &s;o it is too re|cent in memory, to need any Account of it here, other than in general.</P>
<P>The Town has now an opulent, flour|i&s;hing and encrea&s;ing Trade, not rivalling Bri&s;tol, in the Trade to Virginia, and the Engli&s;h I&s;land Colonies in America only, but is in a fair way to exceed and eclip&s;e it, by encrea&s;ing every way in Wealth and Shipping. They trade round the whole I&s;land, &s;end Ships to Noway, to Hamburgh, and to the Baltick, as al&s;o to Holland, and Flanders; &s;o that, in a word, they are almo&s;t become like the Londoners, univer&s;al Merchants.</P>
<P>The Trade of Liverpoole is not my particular Province, &s;o I &s;hall be &s;hort in that part; it con&s;i&s;ts not only in Merchan|dizing and Corre&s;pondencies beyond Seas; but as they Import almo&s;t all kind of foreign Goods, they have con&s;equently a great Inland Trade, and a great Corre&s;|pondence with Ireland, and with Scot|land, for their C$n&s;umption, exactly as it is with Bri&s;tol; and they really divide the Trape with Bri&s;tol upon very remark|able Equalities.</P>
<P>Bri&s;tol lies open to the Iri&s;h Sea, &s;o does Liverpoole: Bri&s;tol trades chiefly to the South and We&s;t Parts of Ireland; from Dublin in the Ea&s;t, to Galloway We&s;t; Liverpoole has all the Trade of the Fa&s;t Shore and the North, from the Harbour of Dublin to London Derry</P>
<P>Bri&s;tol has the Trade of South Wales; Liverpoole great Part of the Trade of North Wales; Bri&s;tol has the South We&s;t Counties of England and &s;ome N rth of it, as high as Bridge North, and perhaps to Shrewsbury; Liverpoole has all the Northern Counties, and a large Con&s;ump|tion of Goods in Che&s;hire and Stafford|&s;hire are &s;upplied from Liverpoole. It is &s;ome Advantage to the growing Com|merce of this Town, that the Freemen of it are, in con&s;equence of that Freedom, Free al&s;o of Bri&s;tol; and they are Free al&s;o of the Corporations of Waterford and Waxford in the Kingdom of Ireland. Not that the&s;e Corporation Privileges are of any great Value to Liverpoole in its foreign Trade, but in particular Ca&s;es it may be &s;ome Advantage, as in Town Duties, in admitting them to &s;et up Trades in tho&s;e Corporations, and the like.</P>
<P>The People of Liverpoole &s;eem to have a different Seene of Commerce to act on from the City of Bri&s;tol, which to me is a particular Advantage to both, namely, that though they may rival one another in their Appearances, in their Number of Shipping, and in &s;everal Particulars, yet they need not interfere with one ano|ther's Bu&s;ine&s;s, but either of them &s;eem to have room enough to extend their Trade, even at home and abroad, without cla&s;hing with one another. One has all the North, and the other all the South of Britain to corre&s;pond in. As for Wales, 'tis, as it were, divided between them by Nature it &s;elf. Bri&s;tol lies open to South Wales, and
<PB REF="428">
into the very Heart of, by the Naviga|tion of the Rivers Wye and Lug, and by the many open Harbours all the Way the Milford and St. David's, and into all the Ea&s;t Side of Wales, and the Coun|ties of Monmouth, Hereford and Salop, by the Severn; Liverpoole has the &s;ame with North Wales by the Water of Dee, the Cluyd, the Conway, Canal of the Mona, and all the Rivers in Carnar|von Bay.</P>
<P>Ireland is, as it were, all their own, and &s;hared between them, as above; and for the Northern Coa&s;t of it, if the Li|verpoole Men have not the whole Fi&s;he|ry, or, at lea&s;t, in Company with the Merchants of London Derry, the fault is their own. The Situation of Liverpoole gives it a very great Advantage to im|prove their Commerce, and extend it in Northern Inland Counties of England, particularly into Che&s;hire and Stafford|&s;hire, by the new Navigation of the Ri|vers Mer&s;ee, the Weaver, and the Dane, by the la&s;t of which they come &s;o near the Trent with their Goods, that they make no Difficulty to carry them by Land to Burton, and from thence cor|re&s;pond quite through the Kingdom, even to Hull; and they begin to be very &s;en|&s;ible of the Advantage of &s;uch a Com|merce. But I mu&s;t not dwell here; I might otherwi&s;e take up great part of the Sheets I have left in de&s;cribing the Commerce of this Town, and &s;ome of its Neighbours.</P>
<P>I return therefore to the De&s;cription of it as a Town; the Situation being on the North Bank of the River, and with the particular di&s;advantage of a flat Shore. This expo&s;ed the Merchants to great Difficulties in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, for though the Harbour was good and the Ships rode well in the Offing, yet they were obliged to ride there as in a Road rather than a Harbour. Here was no Mole or Haven to bring in their Ships and lay them up, (as the Seamen call it) for the Winter; nor any Key for the deli|vering their Goods, as at Bri&s;tol, Biddi|ford, Newca&s;tle $span$ Upon this, the Inhabitants and Merchan$ have, of late Years, and &s;ince the vi&s;i|ble encrea&s;e of their Trade, made a large Ba&s;in or wet Dock, at the Ea&s;t end of the Town, where at an immen&s;e Charge, the Place con&s;idered, they have brought the Tide from the Mer&s;ee to &s;low up by an opening that looks to the South, and the Ships go in North; &s;o that the Town entirely &s;helters it from the We&s;ter|ly and Northerly Winds, the Hills from the Ea&s;terly, and the Ships lie, as in a Mill-pond, with the utmo&s;t &s;afety and convenience. As this is &s;o great a Benefit to the Town, and that the like is not to be &s;een in any Place in England but here, I mean London excepted, it is well worth the ob&s;ervation and imitation of many other trading Places in Britain who want &s;uch a Convenience, and, for want of it, lo&s;e their Trade.</P>
<P>The new Church built on the $span$ Side of the Town is worth $span$ 'Tis a noble, large Building, $span$ well fini&s;h d; has in it $span$ Marble placed in the $span$ &s;urrounded with $span$ do; the Gift of the $span$ a Merchant of London, $span$ concerned in Trade on this $span$ many Years Member of Parliament $span$ Lanca&s;ter. There is a beautiful Tower to this Church, and a new Ring of eight very good Bells.</P>
<P>The Town-Hou&s;e is a fine modern Building, &s;tanding all upon Pillars of Free|&s;tone; the Place under it is their $word$ or Exchange, for the Meceing of their Merchants; but they begin to want Room, and talk of enlarging it or removing the Exchange to the other part of the Town, where the Ships and the Merchants Bu|&s;ine&s;s is nearer hand.</P>
<P>In a Word, there is no Town in Eng|land, London excepted, that can equal Liverpoole for the finene&s;s of the Streets, and beauty of the Buildings; many of the Hou&s;es are all of Free Stone, and compleatly fini&s;hed; and all the re&s;t (of the new part I mean) of Brick, as hand|&s;omely built $span$ it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB REF="429">
Mr. Cambden, &s;ays, it was a neat and populous Town in his Time; his Re|verend Continuator confirms what I have &s;aid thus, that it was more than doubly encrea&s;ed in Buildings and People in twen|ty eight Years, and that the Cu&s;toms were augmented Tenfold in the &s;ame Time; to which I am to add, that they are now much greater, that being written about two and thirty Years ago, before the new Church, or the wet Dock, men|tioned above, were made, and we know they have gone on encrea&s;ing in Trade, Buildings and People, to this Day. I re|fer the Reader therefore to judge of the probable Greatne&s;s of it now.</P>
<P>From hence the Mer&s;ee opening into the Iri&s;h Sea, we could &s;ee the great and famous Road of Hile Lake, made fa|mous for the &s;hipping off, or rather Ren|dezvous of the Army and Flect under King William, for the Conque&s;t of Ire|land Anno 1689, for here the Men of War&punc; rode as our Ships do in the Downs, till the Tran&s;ports came to them from Che|&s;ter and this Town.</P>
<P>The Sea Coa&s;t affords little remark|able on the We&s;t Side of this Port, till we come farther North; &s;o we left that Part of the County, and going Ea&s;t we came to Warrington: This is a large Market Town upon the River Mer&s;ee, over which is a &s;tately Stone Bridge, which is the only Bridge of Communi|cation for the whole County with the County of Che&s;ter; it is on the great Road from London leading to Carli&s;le and Scotland, and, in Ca&s;e of War, has always been e&s;teemed a Pa&s;s of the ut|mo&s;t Importance. It was found to be &s;o upon &s;everal extraordinary Occa&s;ions in the time of the late Civil War; and had the Rebels advanced thus far in the late Pre&s;ton Affair, &s;o as to have made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it, it would have been $o again; and on that Account, the King's Forces took &s;pecial Care, by a &s;peedy ad|vance to &s;ecure it.</P>
<P>Warrington is a large, populous old $uilt Town, but rich and full of good Country Trade&s;men. Here is particular|ly a weekly Market for Linnen, as I &s;aw at Wrexham in Wales, a Market for Flannel. The Linnen &s;old at this Market is, generally &s;peaking, a &s;ort of Table Linnen, called Huk-a-back or Huk-a-buk; 'tis well known among the good Hou&s;ewives, &s;o I need not de&s;cribe it. I was told there are generally as many Pieces of this Linnen &s;old here every Market Day as amounts to five hundred Pounds value, &s;ometimes much more, and all made in the Neighbourhood of the Place.</P>
<P>From hence, on the Road to Manche|&s;ter, we pa&s;s'd the great Bog or Wa&s;te call'd Chatmos, the fir&s;t of that kind that we &s;ee in England, from any of the South Parts hither. It extends on the Left-hand of the Road for five or &s;ix Miles Ea&s;t and We&s;t, I was told it was, in &s;ome Places, &s;even or eight Miles from North to South. The Nature of the&s;e Mo&s;&s;es, for we found there are many of them in this Country is this, and you will take this for a De&s;cription of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Surface, at a di&s;tance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither Hor&s;e or Man, unle&s;s in an exceeding dry Sea&s;on, and then not &s;o as to be pa&s;&s;able, or that any one &s;hould travel over them.</P>
<P>The Sub&s;tance of the Surface &s;eems to be a Collection of the &s;mall Roots of innumerable Vegetables matted together, interwoven &s;o thick, as well the bigger Roots as the &s;maller Fibres, that it makes a Sub&s;tance hard enough to cut out in|to Turf, or rather Peat, which, in &s;ome Places, the People cut out, and piling them up in the Sun, dry them for their Fewel. The Roots I &s;peak of are generally &s;mall and &s;oft not unlike the Roots of A&s;paragus or of Bearbind, they have no Earth among them, except what they contract from the Air, and Du&s;t fly|ing in it, but the Rain keeps them, as it were, always growing, though not much encrea&s;ing.</P>
<P>In &s;ome Places the Surface of this kind lies thicker, in &s;ome not very thick. We
<PB REF="430">
&s;aw it in &s;ome Places eight or nine Foot thick, and the Water that dreins from it look'd clear, but of a deep brown, like &s;tale Beer. What Nature meant by &s;uch a u&s;ele&s;s Production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the Land is entirely wa&s;te, above, except, as above, for the poor Cottagers fuel, and the Quantity u&s;ed for that is very &s;mall.</P>
<P>Under this Mo&s;s, or rather in the very Body of it, not here only, but in &s;everal like Places, and perhaps in all of them, tho&s;e antient Fir Trees are found, of which &s;o much di&s;pute has been what they are or were, but $word$ how th y &s;hould come there. $span$ Mob $word$ is &s;ometimes expended upon the&s;e $span$ which, in my weak $span$ to no more than this; $word$ Na|ture, who&s;e Works are all directed by a &s;uperior Hand, has been guided to pro|duce Trees here under Ground, as &s;he does in other Places above Ground; that th$&s;e live rather than grow, though 'tis manife&s;t they encrea&s;e too, otherwi&s;e they would not be found of &s;o great a B$lk; that as the Trees above the Surface grow $r$ct and high, the&s;e he hori|zontal; tho&s;e &s;hoot forth Branches and Leaves; the&s;e &s;hoot forth no $ranches or Leaves, yet have a Vegetation by Me|thods directed by Nature, and particularly to that kind; and 'tis remarkable, that as if they lie buried they will grow and en|crea&s;e, &s;o if you take them up, and plant them in the Air, they will wither and d$$; and why &s;hould this be more &s;trange than that a Fi$h will &s;trangle in the Air, and a bird drown in the Water, or than that every thing lives in its proper Ele|ment, and will not-live, or at lea&s;t not thrive out of it.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervale, that the&s;e Trees are a kind of Fir, and very full of Turp$$tine. Whether there is any Tar in them I am not po&s;itive, but I &s;uppo&s;e there it. And yet I do not &s;ee, that for this Rea&s;on they &s;hould not be a natural ordinar Pro|duct, as other Vegetables are.</P>
<P>If it be enquired, why no kind of Trees &s;hould grow thus but Fir; it $span$ be as well ask'd, why no Stone $span$ &s;uch or &s;uch Q$ar$ies, or $span$ Marble, or in others than Free $word$ Na|ture alone can re$ove that part.</P>
<P>As to then being brought hither by the general Convul&s;ion of the $span$ Deluge, the Thought is &s;o $span$ Thing, &s;o incong$uons, that I $span$ nether needs or de&s;erves any $span$.</P>
<P>From hence we came on to Manche&s;ter, one of the greate&s;t, if not really the $word$ meet V $l$$e in $span$ a w$l$'d Town, $span$ Corporation&punc; they &s;end no Members to Parliament: $span$ highe&s;t Magi&s;trate they have is a Con&s;table or Headborough; and yet it has a Collegia$e Church, &s;everal Pa$ $word$ takes up a large &s;pace of Ground and, including the Suburb, or that part of the Town called&mdash;over the $word$ it is &s;aid to contain above fifty $word$ People; and though &s;ome People may think this &s;trange, and that I &s;peak by gue&s;s, and without Judgment, I &s;hall ju&s;tify my Opinion &s;o well, that I $$|lieve it will convince you my $span$ is at lea&s;t very probable, and much under what Fame tells us is true.</P>
<P>The Manche&s;ter Trade we all know; and all that are concerned in it know that it is, as all our other Manufactures are, very much encrea&s;ed wi$hin th$&s;e th$$$y or forty Years&punc; e&s;pecially beyond $word$ was before; and as the $span$ encrea&s;ed, the People mu&s;t be $span$ of cour&s;e. It is true, that $span$ of the Manufacture may $span$ it &s;elf $span$ in the $span$ &s;o mo$e Ha $s may be employed $span$ County without any encrea&s;e in the $span$ But I an$wer, that though $span$ yet as the Town and Pari&s;h $span$ is the Center of be Manufacture, $span$ of that Manufacture would $word$ encrea&s;e the$e fir&s;t, and th$n the People $$e$e not being &s;ufficient, it $word$ &s;pread it &s;elf further.</P>

<P>The College was fir&s;t founded, A. D. 1421. by Thomas de la Ware, at fir&s;t, Rector of the &s;aid Pari&s;h Church, and Brother to the Lord De la Ware, whom
<PB REF="432">
he &s;ucceeded in the E&s;tate and Honour; and then him&s;elf founded a College there, con&s;i&s;ting of one Ma&s;ter or Keeper, eight Fellows Chaplains, four Clerks, and &s;ix Chori&s;ters, in Honour of St. Mary, (to whom the &s;aid Pari&s;h Church was for|merly dedicated) St. Dennis of France, St. George of England.</P>
<P>This Foundation was di&s;&s;olved 1547, in the fir&s;t Year of King Edward VI. the Lands and Revenues of it taken in|to the King's Hands, and by him de|mi&s;ed to the Farl of Derby, and the Col|lege-Hou&s;e, and &s;ome Lands &s;old to the &s;aid Earl.</P>
<P>After this, the College was refounded by Queen Mary, who re&s;tored mo&s;t of the La&nacute;ds and Revenues, only the Col|lege it&s;elf, and &s;ome of its Revenues, re|mained &s;till in the Hands of the Earl of Derby.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o founded anew by Queen E|lizabeth, A. D. 1578. by the Name of Chri&s;t's College, in Manche&s;ter, con&s;i&s;ting of one Warden, four Fellows, two Chap|lains, four Singing Men, and four Cho|ri&s;ters, the Number being le&s;&s;ened, be|cau&s;e the Revenues were &s;o; chiefly by the Covetou&s;ne&s;s and ba&s;e Dealing of Thomas Herle, then Warden, and his Fellows, who &s;old away, or made &s;uch long Lea&s;es of the Revenues, as could, never yet &s;ome of them, be retrieved.</P>
<P>It was la&s;t of all refounded by King Charles the Fir&s;t, A. D. 1636. con&s;i&s;ting then of one Warden, four Fellows, two Chaplains, four Singing-Men, and four Chori&s;ters, and incorporating them, as before, by the Name of the Warden and Fellows of Chri&s;t's College in Manche|&s;ter, the Statutes for the &s;ame being drawn up by Archbi&s;hop Laud.</P>
<P>The Ho&s;pital was founded by Hum|phry Cheetham E&s;q; and incorporated by King Charles the Second, de&s;igned by the &s;aid bountiful Benefactor for the Maintenance of forty poor Boys out of the Town and Pari&s;h of Manche&s;ter, and &s;ome other neighbouring Pari&s;hes; but &s;ince 'tis enlarged to the Number of &s;ixty, by the Governors of the &s;aid Ho&s;|pital, to be taken in between the of &s;ix and ten, and there $word$ with Meat, Drink, Lodging and $word$ to the Age of fourteen, and then to bound Apprentices to &s;ome hone&s;t $word$ or Calling, at the Charge of the $aid $word$ for the Maintenance of which $word$ endowed it with the yearly Re$$n$e&punc; 420 l. which is &s;ince improve$ $y $word$ care and good husbandry of the $word$ or Governours, to the yearly Sum $ 517 l. 8 s. 4d. they having laid out $ the Purcha&s;e of Lands the Sum of $word$ which was &s;aved out of the Yearly i$|come, over and above the Maintenan$ of the poor Children, and others, belong|ing to the &s;aid Ho&s;pital, wherein the$ there are annually near &s;eventy Per$o$ provided for.</P>
<P>By the Bounty of the &s;aid Fouude is al&s;o erected a very fair and &s;pacio$ Library, already furni&s;hed with a com|petent Stock of choice and valuable Books to the number near Four Thou&s;and, an$ daily increa&s;ing with the income of 116$ per Ann. &s;ettled upun the &s;ame by th$ &s;aid worthy Benefactor, to buy Book for ever, and to afford a competent Sa|lary for a Library Keeper. There is $word$ a large School for the Ho&s;pital Boys where they are daily in&s;tructed, and taugh to read and write.</P>
<P>The Publick School was founded A. D. 1519. by Hugh Oldham, D. D. and Bi|&s;hop of Exeter, who bought the Land on which the School &s;tand$, and too$ the Mills there in Lea&s;e of the Lord D$ la Ware, for &s;ixty Years; afterwards with the Bi&s;hop's Money, Hugh Benwick$ and Joan his Si&s;ter, purcha&s;ed of the Lor$ De la Ware, his Land in Awcoates, and the Mills upon Right and Left of them in Feo&s;&s;ment to the &s;aid Free School for ever, which Revenues are of late very much encrea&s;ed by the Feo$&s;$es of the School; who, out of the improvements have as well con&s;iderably augmented the Ma&s;ters Salaries, as the Exhibitions an|nually allowed to the maintenance o$ &s;uch Scholars at the Univer&s;ity, as the Warden of the College and the High
<PB REF="433">
Ma&s;ter &s;hall think requi&s;ite, and have be&s;ides, for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, added a third Ma&s;ter, for whom they have lately erected a new and convenient School at the end of the other.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e publick Benefactions and Endowments, there have been &s;everal other con&s;iderable Sums of Money, and annual Revenues, left and bequeathed to the Poor of the &s;aid Town, who are thereby, with the Kindne&s;s and Charity of the pre&s;ent Inhabitants, competently provided for&punc; without &s;tarving at home, or being forced to &s;eek Relief abroad.</P>
<P>As for the Antiquity of the Place, I have no room to mention it here, though the Authors who have mentioned it &s;ay much of that Part too; nor is it my Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Antiquity of the Manufac|ture indeed is what is of mo&s;t Con&s;ide|ration; and this, though we cannot trace it by Hi&s;tory, yet we have rea&s;on to believe it began &s;omething earlier than the great Woollen Manufactures in other Parts of England, of which I have &s;po|ken &s;o often, becau&s;e the Cotton might it &s;elf come from the Mediterranean, and be known by Corre&s;pondents in tho&s;e Countries, when that of Wool was not pu&s;h'd at becau&s;e our Neighbours wrought the Goods, and though they bought the Wool from England, yet we did not want the Goods, whereas, without ma|king the Cotton Goods at home, our People could not have them at all; and that Nece&s;&s;ity, which is the Mother of invention, might put them $ne; where|as having not the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity, Igno|rance and Indolence prevented the other.</P>
<P>I am the rather of this Opinion too, becau&s;e Mr. Cambden &s;peaks of this $word$ too, by the Name of Manche|&s;ter $span$ and that being written in Q$$$n $$$zabeth h$s time, when the Wool|len Manufacture was, though much im|proved, yet, as we may lay, in its In|fancy, or, at lea&s;t, not at full Age; we may rea&s;onably believe, that Cotton was the elder Manufacture of the two, and that by &s;ome con&s;iderable Time. This Manufacture of Manche&s;ter Cottons, as it &s;eems they were then call'd, I &s;uppo&s;e is the &s;ame that is now call'd Fu&s;tian or Dimity, or that both the&s;e are but dif|ferent kinds of the other.</P>
<P>I cannot doubt but this encrea&s;ing Town will, &s;ome time or other, obtain &s;ome better Face of Government, and be incorporated, as it very well de&s;erves to be.</P>
<P>The River Irwell runs clo&s;e by this Town, and receives the little River Irke ju&s;t above the Town, on the North and North Ea&s;t Side. There is a very firm, but ancient Stone Bridge over the Irwell, which is built exceeding high&punc; becau&s;e this River, though not great, yet com|ing from the mountainous Part of the Country, &s;wells &s;ometimes &s;o &s;uddenly, that in one Night's time they told me the Waters would frequently ri&s;e four or five Yards, and the next Day fall as ha&s;tily as they ro&s;e.</P>
<P>The Author of the Geographical Dic|tionary places this Town upon the Bank of the River Spolden, which Mr. Camb|den's Continuator, mentioned $o often, takes notice of it as a Mi&s;take, and &s;o it is; but I &s;uppo&s;e 'twas occa&s;ioned by this: There is a River named Spodden, not Spolden, which ri&s;ing under Black|&s;tone Edge, runs into the Roch at Roch|dale, and &s;o lo&s;ing its Name in the Roch, runs into the Irwell, about Ratchff, &s;ix or &s;even Miles above Manche&s;ter, and, in &s;ome Maps, they have made not the Spodden lo&s;s its Name in the Roch, but the Roch in the Spodden, and &s;o give it yet its own Name after i$ joins the Irwell, and on to Manche&s;ter.</P>
<P>About eight Mile from Manche&s;ter, North We&s;t, lies Bolton, the Town which gives Title to the noble Family of Pow|let, Dukes of Bolton, rai&s;ed to the heighth of Duke by the late King William, at the &s;ame time, or near it, with the Dukes of Bed|ford, Devon&s;hire, Rutland, and Newca&s;tle. We &s;aw nothing remarkable in this Town,
<PB REF="434">
but that the Cotton Manufacture reached hither; but the Place did not, like Man|che&s;ter, &s;eem &s;o flouri&s;hing and encrea&s;|ing.</P>
<P>On the Left-hand of this Town, We&s;t, even to the Sea &s;hore, there are not ma|ny Towns of note, except Wiggon&punc; on the high Po&s;t Road, and Ormskirk, near which we &s;aw Latham Hou&s;e, famous for its being not only gallantly defended in the Times of the late fatal Wars, but that it was &s;o by a Woman; for the La|dy Charlotte, Counte&s;s of Derby, de|fended the Hou&s;e to the la&s;t $word$ again&s;t the Parliament Forces; nor could &s;he ever be brought to capitualate, but kept the Hold till Prince Rupert, with a &s;trong Body of the King's Army, came to her Relief, and obliged the Enemy to rai&s;e their Siege, Anno 1644: It was in|deed ruin'd in a &s;econd Siege, and is not yet fully recovered from the Calamity of it.</P>
<P>In this Town Bolton the old Earl of Derby was beheaded by the Parliament, or by the Army rather, in the time of tho&s;e fatal Wars, October 15, 1651.</P>
<P>In the Neighbourhood of this Town, that is to &s;ay, between Wiggan and Bol|ton, in the E&s;tate of Sir Roger Brad&s;haw, is found that kind of Coal they call Canell or Candle Coal, which, tho' they are found here in great plenty, and are very cheap, are yet very &s;ingular; for there are none &s;uch to be &s;een in Britain, or perhaps in the World be&s;ides: They &s;o &s;oon take Fire, that, by putting a lighted Candle to them, they are pre&s;ently in a Flame, and yet hold Fire as long as any Coals whatever, and more or le&s;s, as they are placed in the Grate or Hearth, whether flat or edg'd, whether right up and down, and polar, or level and hori|zontal.</P>
<P>They are &s;mooth and &s;lick when the Pieces part from one another, and will poli&s;h like Alaba&s;ter; then a Lady may take them up in a Cambrick Handkerchief and they will not &s;oil it, though they are as black as the deepe&s;t Jet. They are the mo&s;t plea&s;ant agreeable&punc; Fuel that can be found, but they are remote; and th ugh &s;ome of them have been brought to Lon|don, yet they are &s;o dear, by rea&s;on of the Carriage, that few care to buy them; we &s;aw &s;ome of them at Warrington too, but all from the &s;ame Pits.</P>
<P>We &s;aw nothing remarkable in Orms|kirk but the Monuments of the $word$ Family of the Stanly's, before they $word$ to the Title of Earls of Derby. $word$ they are all buried, and have &s;ome very fine, tho' antient, and even d$c$v$d Re|mains of Monuments; and here they con|tinue to bury the Family &s;till, wh$$$ Seat of Latham, as I &s;aid before, is but hard by&punc; Mr Cambden gives a full A c$unt how Latham Hou&s;e, and a great E&s;tate with it, came to the Earls of $word$ by Marriage, and has continued $span$ Fa|mily to this Day.</P>
<P>It is not to be forgot that $span$ is near Winnick, a &s;mall Town, $ut a large Pari&s;h, and great Benefice; but tho' it might be the greate&s;t in England in tho&s;e Days, 'tis very far from being now &s;o; for we never heard that it was worth above 800l. per Annum, whereas Sedg|field, near Durham&punc; is valued at this time at 1200l. per Annum at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over here the Burning Well, as 'tis called, near Wiggan, though I mu&s;t acknowledge, that being turned from Bolton towards Rochdale, before I heard any thing of it that I gave any Credit to, I did not go back to &s;ee it; not that I had not Curio&s;ity enough, if I had been &s;atisfied it was valuable, but the Country People, who u&s;ually enlarge up|on &s;uch Things rather than le&s;&s;en them, made light of this; and &s;o I cool'd in my Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>But the Account given in publick of it is al&s;o &s;o particular, that it abundantly makes amends to me for my not &s;eeing it. Mr. Cambden's Continuator gives the fol|lowing Account of it:</P>
<P>Within a Mile and a half of Wiggan is a Well, which does not appear to be a Spring but reather Rain Water, at fir&s;t
<PB REF="435">
Sight. There is nothing about it&punc; that $eems extraordinary, but, upon emptying $t, there pre&s;ently breaks out a &s;ulphure|$us Vapour, which makes the Water bub|ble up as if it boiled; a Candle being put $o it, it pre&s;ently takes fire, and burns $ike Brandy; the Flame, in a calm Sea|$on, will continue a whole Day, by the Heat whereof they can boil Eggs, Meat, $word$ though the Water it &s;elf be cold. $y this bubbling the Water does not en|$ea&s;e, but is only kept in Motion by the $on&s;tant Halitus of the Vapours break|$$g out; the &s;ame Water taken out of the $ell will not burn, as neither the Mud $$on which the Halitus has beat.</P>
<P>Dr. Leigh, in his Natural Hi&s;tory of $anca&s;hire, not only de&s;cribes it, but ac|$$unts very judiciou&s;ly for the thing it $f, and by it for the Warmth of all hot $$ths.</P>
<P>As I have noted above, we turned Ea&s;t $e, and came to Bury, a &s;mall Market $wn on the River Roch, mentioned $ove, where we ob&s;erved the Manu|$$$ture of Cotton, which are &s;o great at $nche&s;ter, Bolton, &amp;c. was ended, and $word$ Woollen Manufacture of coar&s;e Sorts, $ed Half thicks and Ker&s;ics, began, on $ch the whole Town &s;eemed bu&s;y and $word$ at work; and &s;o in all the Villages $ut it</P>
<P>$rom thence we went on to Rochdale, $rger and more populous Town than $word$ and under the Hills, called Black|$e Edge, of which I have &s;poken &s;uf|$$tly in my former Letter, having $elled this Way to Hallifax, &amp;c.</P>
<P>$ut I mu&s;t now look Northward. This $word$ County, as we advance, grows $ow, and not only &s;o, but mountain|$$ and not &s;o full of Towns or Inha|$ts as the South Part, which I have $word$ over; Pre&s;ton and Lanca&s;ter are the Towns of Note remaining.</P>
<P>$e&s;ton is a fine Town, and tolerably $f People, but not like Liverpoole or $$he&s;ter; be&s;ides, we come now be| the $rading Part of the County. $s no Manufacture; the Town is full of Attorneys, Proctors, and Notaries, the Proce&s;s of Law here being of a dif|ferent Nature than they are in other Places, it being a Dutchy and County Palatine, and having particular Privileges of its own. The People are gay here, though not perhaps the richer for that; but it has by that obtained the Name of Proud Pre&s;ton. Here is a great deal of good Company, but not &s;o much, they &s;ay, as was before the late bloody Action with the Northern Rebels; not that the Battle hurt many of the immediate Inha|bitants, but &s;o many Families there and thereabout, have been touched by the Con&s;equences of it, that it will not be re|covered in a few Years, and they &s;eem to have a kind of remenbrance of Things upon them &s;till.</P>
<P>Lanca&s;ter is the next, the County Town, and &s;ituate near the Mouth of the River Lone or Lune. The Town is antient; it lies, as it were, in its own Ruins, and has little to recommend but a decayed Ca&s;tle, and a more decayed Port (for no Ships of any con&s;iderable Burthen) the Bridge is hand&s;ome and &s;trong, but, as be|fore, here is little or no Trade, and few People. It &s;urpri&s;ed me to hear that there is not above &s;ixty Pari&s;hes in all this large County, but many of them are nece&s;&s;arily very large.</P>
<P>This Part of the Country &s;eemed very &s;trange after coming out of &s;o rich, popu|lous and fruitful a Place, as I have ju&s;t now de&s;cribed; for here we were, as it were, lock'd in between the Hills on one Side high as the Clouds, and prodigiou&s;ly higher, and the Sea on the other, and the Sea it &s;elf &s;eemed de&s;olate and wild, for it was a Sea without Ships, here being no Sea Port or Place of Trade, e&s;pecially for Merchants; &s;o that, except Colliers pa&s;ting between Ireland and Whitehaven with Coals, the People told us they &s;hould not &s;ee a Ship under Sail for many Weeks together.</P>
<P>Here, among the Mountains, our Curi|o&s;ity was frequently moved to enquire what high Hill this was, or that; and
<PB REF="436">
we &s;oon were &s;aluted with that old Ver&s;e which I remembered to have &s;een in Mr. Cambden, viz.</P>
<P>Inglebrough, Pendle-hill and Penigent, Are the highe&s;t Hills between Scot|land and Trent.</P>
<P>Indeed, they were, in my Thoughts, mon|&s;trous high, but in a Country all moun|tainous and full of innumerable high Hills, it was not ea&s;y for a Traveller to judge which was highe&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e Hills high and formi|dable only, but they had a kind of an un|ho&s;pitable Terror in them. Here were no rich plea&s;ant Valleys between them, as among the Alps; no Lead Mines and Veins of rich Oar, as in the Peak; no Coal Pits, as in the Hills about Hallifax, much le&s;s Gold, as in the Andes, but all barren and wild, of no U&s;e or Advan|tage either to Man or Bea&s;t. Indeed here was formerly, as far back as Q. Eliza|beth, &s;ome Copper Mines, and they wrought them to a good Advantage; but whether the Vein of Oar fail'd, or what el&s;e was the Rea&s;on, we know not, but they are all given over long &s;ince, and this Part of the Country yields little or no|thing at all.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not forget Winander Meer, which makes the utmo&s;t Northern Bounds of this Shire, which is famous for the Char Fi&s;h found here and hereabout, and no where el&s;e in England; it is found in|deed in &s;ome of the Rivers or Lakes in Swi&s;&s;erland among the Alps, and &s;ome &s;ay in North Wales; but I que&s;tion the la&s;t. It is a curious Fi&s;h, and, as a Dain|ty is Potted, and fent far and near, as Pre&s;ents to the be&s;t Friends; but the Quantity they take al&s;o is not great Mr. Cambden's Continuator calls it very happily the Golden Alpine Trour.</P>
<P>Here we entred We&s;tmoreland, a Coun|try eminent only for being the Wilde&s;t, mo&s;t barren and frightful of any that I have pa&s;&s;ed over in England, or even in Wales it &s;elf; the We&s;t Side, which bor|ders on Cumberland, is indeed bounded by a Chain of almo&s;t mountains, which&punc; in the Language of the Country, are cal|led Fells, and the&s;e are called Fourne&s;s Fells, from the famous $r mo$tory bear|ing that Name, and an Abbey built $word$ in ancient Times, and called Fourne&s;s</P>
<P>But 'tis of no Advantage to repr$$$$ Horror, as the Character of a Country in the middle of all the fri$htin$ Ap|pearances to the Right and Left $word$ here are &s;ome very plea&s;ant, $word$ and manufacturing Towns, and con$$|quently populous.</P>
<P>Such as Kirby Laun&s;dale&punc; or Luned$$$ becau&s;e it &s;tands on the River Lune which is the Boundary of the County and leaves the Hills of M$ller&s;tang For|re&s;t, which are, in many Places, unpa$|&s;able. The Manufacture which the Peo|ple are employed in here, are $word$ Woollen Cloths, at Kirkby Laun&s;d$$$ and Kendal, and farther Northward&punc; Security for the Continuance o the Peo|ple in the Place; for here is a va$t $word$ cour&s;e of People In a Word, I find $word$ room to doubt the Hills above mentioned go on to Scotland, for from &s;$me of th$ Heighths hereabouts, they can &s;ee eve$ into Scotland it &s;elf.</P>

<P>When we entred at the South part of this County, I began indeed to think of Merioneth&s;hire, and the Mountains of Snowden in North Wales, &s;eeing nothing round me, in many Places, but unpa&s;|&s;able Hills, who&s;e Tops, covered with Snow, &s;eemed to tell us all the plea&s;ant Part of England was at an end. The great Winauder Meer, like the Mediter|ranean Sea, extends it &s;elf on the We&s;t Side for twelve Miles and more, reckon|ing from North Bridge on the South, where it contracts it &s;elf again into a River up to Gre&s;mere North, and is the Boundary of the County, as I have &s;aid, on that Side; and the Engli&s;h Appenine, as Mr. Cambden calls them, that is, the Mountains of York&s;hire North Riding, he like a Wall of Bra&s;s on the other; and indeed, in one Sen&s;e, they are a Wall of Bra&s;s; for it is the Opinion of the mo&s;t &s;kilful and knowing People in the Coun|try, that tho&s;e Moun$$ins are full of in|exhau&s;tible Mines of Copper, and &s;o rich, as not only to be called Bra&s;s, Copper, being convertible into Bra&s;s, but al&s;o to have a Quantity of Gold in them al&s;o: It is true, they do at this time work at $ome Copper Mines here, but they find the Oar lies &s;o deep, and is &s;o hard to come a$&punc; that they do not &s;eem to go cheerfully on.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this terrible a&s;pect of the Hills, when having pa&s;&s;ed by Ken|$dal, and de&s;cending the frightful Moun|$ains, began to find the Flat Country &s;how $t &s;elf; we &s;oon &s;aw that the North and North Ea&s;t Part of the County was plea|$ant, rich, fruitful, and, compared to the other Part, populous. The River Eden, he la&s;t River of England on this Side, as he Tyne is on the other, r$&s;es in this Part out of the Side of a mon&s;trous high Mountain, called Mowill Hill, or Wild|$ore Fell&punc; which you plea&s;e; after which, $word$ runs through the middle of this Vale, which is, as above, a very agreeable and $lea&s;ant Country, or perhaps &s;eems to be &s;o the more, by the horror of the Ea&s;t|ern and Southern Part.</P>
<P>In this Vale, and on the Bank of this River, &s;tands Appleby, once a flouri&s;h|ing City, now a &s;cattering, decayed, and half-demoli&s;hed Town, the fatal Effects of the ancient Inroads of tho&s;e Scots, when this being a Frontier County, tho&s;e Inva&s;ions were frequent, and who &s;everal times were Ma&s;ters of this Town, and at length burnt it to the Ground, which Blow it has not yet recovered.</P>
<P>The Searchers after Antiquity find much more to recreate their Minds, and &s;atisfy their Curio&s;ity, in the&s;e Northern Coun|tries than in tho&s;e farther South, which are more populous and better inhabited, becau&s;e the Remains of ancient Things have met with le&s;s Injury here, where there are not &s;o many People, or &s;o ma|ny Buildings, or Alterations, Enclo&s;ings and Plantings, as in other Places; but, for my Purpo&s;e, who am to give the pre&s;ent State of Things, here is not much to ob&s;erve; nor are there many Hou&s;es or Seats of the Nobility in this Part, tho' many ancient Families dwell here, as particularly Strickland, from the Lands of Strickland, Wharton from Wharton Hall, Louther from the River Louther, as above, Warcop of Warcop, Langdale of Langdale, Mu&s;grave from Mu&s;grave, and many others.</P>
<P>The Roman Highway, which I have &s;o often mentioned, and which, in my la&s;t Letter, I left at Leeming Lane and Peers Brigg, in the North Riding of York, en|ters this County from Rear Cro&s;s upon Stanmore, and cro&s;&s;ing it almo&s;t due Ea&s;t and We&s;t, goes through Appleby, pa&s;&s;ing the Eden a little North from Perith, at an ancient Roman Station call'd Provoni|acam, where there was a large and &s;tately Stone Bridge; but now the great Road leads to the Left-hand to Perith, in go|ing to which we fir&s;t pa&s;s the Eden, at a very good Stone Bridge call'd Louther Bridge, and then the Elnot over another.</P>

It was unhappily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the late Party of Scots Highland Rebels, when they made that de&s;perate Pu&s;h in|to England, and which ended at Pre&s;ton. In the Moor or Heath, on the North part of this Town, the Militia of the County making a brave Appearance, and infinitely out-numbering the Highlanders, were drawn up; yet, with all their bra|very, they ran away, as &s;oon as the Scots began to advance to Charge them, and never fired a Gun at them, leaving the Town at their Mercy. However, to do Ju&s;tice even to the Rebels, they offered no Injury to the Town, only quartered in it one Night, took what Arms and Ammunition they could find, and advanc|ed towards Kendal.</P>
<P>From hence, in one Stage, through a Country full of Ca&s;tles, for almo&s;t every Gentleman's Hou&s;e is a Ca&s;tle, we came to Carli&s;le, a &s;mall, but well fortified Ci|ty, the Frontier Place and Key of Eng|land on the We&s;t Sea, as Berwick upon Tweed is on the Ea&s;t; and in both which there have, for many Years, I might &s;ay Ages, been &s;trong Garri&s;ons kept to check the invading Scots; from below this Town the famous Picts Wall began, which cro&s;s'd the whole I&s;land to New|ca&s;tle upon Tyne, where I have mention|ed it already.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o the great Roman Highway, ju&s;t before named, has its End, this being the utmo&s;t Station of the Roman Soldiers on this Side.</P>
<P>But before I go on to &s;peak of this Town, I mu&s;t go back, as we did for our particular Satisfaction, to the Sea Coa&s;t, which, in this Northern County, is more remarkable than that of Lanca|&s;hire, though the other is extended much farther in length; for here are &s;ome Towns of good Trade; whereas in Lan|ca&s;hire, Liverpoole excepted, there is no|thing of Trade to be &s;een upon the whole Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>I enquired much for the Pearl Fi&s;hery here, wich Mr. Cambden &s;peaks of, as a thing well known about Ravengla&s;s and the River Ire, which was made a kind of Bubble lately: But the Country People, nor even the Fi&s;hermen, could give us no Account of any &s;uch thing; nor indeed is there any great Quantity of the Shell|fi&s;h to be found here (now) in which the Pearl are found, I mean the large Oy&s;ter or Mu&s;cle. What might be in former Times, I know not.</P>
<P>The Cape or Head Land of St. Bees, &s;till pre&s;erves its Name; as for the La|dy, like that of St. Tabbs beyond Ber|wick, the Story is become fabulous, viz. about her procuring, by her Prayers, a deep Snow on Mid&s;ummer Day, her taming a wild Bull that did great Damage in the Country; the&s;e, and the like Tales, I leave where I found them, (viz.) a|mong the Rubbi&s;h of the old Women and the Romi&s;h Prie&s;ts,</P>
<P>In the little Town, which bears her Name there, is a very good Free School, founded by that known and eminent Be|nefactor to, and Promoter of pious De|&s;igns, Archbi&s;hop Grindal; it is endowed very well by him, and the Charity much encrea&s;ed by the late Dr. Lamplugh, Arch|bi&s;hop of York: The Library annexed to this Foundation is very valuable, and &s;till encrea&s;ing by &s;everal Gifts daily added to it; and they &s;how a Li&s;t of the Bene|factors, in which are &s;everal Per&s;ons of Honour and Di&s;tinction. The Ma&s;ter is put in by the Provo&s;t and Fellows of Queen's College in Oxon.</P>
<P>Under this Shore, the Navigation be|ing &s;ecured by this Cape of St. Bees, is the Town of Whitehaven, grown up from a &s;mall Place to be very con&s;iderable by the Coal Trade, which is encrea&s;ed &s;o con&s;iderably of late, that it is now the mo&s;t eminent Port in England for &s;hip|ping off Coals, except Newca&s;tle and Sunderland, and even beyond the la&s;t, for they wholly &s;upply the City of Dublin&punc; and all the Towns of Ireland on that Coa&s;t; and 'tis frequent in time of War, or upon the ordinary Occa&s;ion of cro&s;s Winds, to have two hundred Sail of Ships at a Time go from this Place for Dublin, loaded with Coals.</P>
<P><PB REF="439">
They have of late fallen into &s;ome Merchandizing al&s;o, occa&s;ioned by the great Number of their Shipping, and there are now &s;ome con&s;iderable Merchants; but the Town is yet but young in Trade, and that Trade is &s;o far from being an|cient, that Mr. Cambden does not &s;o much as name the Place, and his Con|tinuator &s;ays very little of it.</P>
<P>About ten Miles from Whitehaven North Ea&s;t, lies Cockermouth, upon the little River Cocker, ju&s;t where it falls in|to the Derwent. This Derwent is famous for its &s;pringing out of tho&s;e Hills, cal|led Derwent Fells, where the ancient Copper Mines were found in Queen Eli|zabeth's Time, and in which, it was $aid, there was a large Quantity of Gold. But they are di&s;continued &s;ince that Time, for what Rea&s;on, I know not; for there are &s;everal Copper Mines now working in $his County, and which, as they told $word$ turn to very good Account</P>
<P>Some tell us, the Copper Mines on $erwent Fells were di&s;continued, becau&s;e $ere being Gold found among the Oar, $word$ Queen claimed the Royalty, and &s;o $word$ body would work them; which &s;eems $word$ be a Rea&s;on why they &s;hould have $word$ applied to the Search with more $word$ but be that how it will, they are $word$ off, and the more probable account $word$ what a Gentleman of Pe$rith gave us, $word$ that the Charge of working them $word$ too great for the Profits.</P>
<P>Here are &s;till Mines of black Lead $word$ which turn to very good Account, $word$ for ought I have yet learned, the $word$ Place in Britain where it is to be $word$.</P>
<P>Here we &s;aw Skiddaw, one of tho&s;e $word$ Hills of which, wherever you come, $word$ People always &s;ay, they are the $word$ in England Skiddaw indeed is a $word$ high Hill, but &s;eems the higher, $word$ not &s;urrounded with other $word$ as in the Ca&s;e in mo&s;t Places where $word$ other Hills are, as at Cheviot, at $word$ and at other Places. From the of Skiddaw they &s;ee plainly into Soct|land, and quite into Dumfries-&s;hire, and farther.</P>
<P>Cockermouth &s;tands upon this River Derwent, about twelve Miles from the Sea, but more by the Windings of the River, yet Ve&s;&s;els of good Burthen may come up to it. The Duke of Somer&s;et is Chief Lord of this Town, in Right of his Lady, the only Heire&s;s of the an|cient Family of the Piercy's, Earls of Norrhumberland, and which the Duke of Somer&s;et enjoys now in Right of Mar|riage.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tles and great Hou&s;es of this E&s;tate go every where to Ruin, as indeed all the Ca&s;tles in this County do; for there being no more Enemy to be expec|ted here, the two Kingdoms being now united into one, there is no more need of &s;trong Holds here, than in any other Part of the Kingdom. At Cockermouth there is a Ca&s;tle which belongs to the &s;ame Family, and, I think they told us, the Duke has no le&s;s than thirteen Ca&s;tles in all, here and in Northumber|land.</P>
<P>This River Derwent is noted for very good Salmon, and for a very great Quan|tity, and Trout. Hence, that is, from Workington at the Mouth of this River, and from Carlifle, not with&s;tanding the great Di&s;tance, they at this Time carry Salmon (fre&s;h as they take it) quite to London. This is performed with Hor&s;es, which, changing often, go Night and Day without Intermi&s;&s;ion, and, as they &s;ay, $very much out-go the Po&s;t; &s;o that the Fi&s;h come very &s;weet and good to London, where the extraordinary Price they yield, being often &s;old at two Shil|lings and Sixpence to four Shillings per Pound, pay very well for the Carriage.</P>
<P>They have innumerable Marks of An|tiquity in this County, as well as in that of We&s;tmoreland, mentioned before; and if it was not, as I &s;aid before, that Anti|quity is not my Search in this Work, yet the Number of Altars, Monuments, and Incriptions, is &s;uch, that it would take up a larger Work than this to copy them, and record them by them&s;elves;
<PB REF="440">
yet, pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e, I could not but take notice of two or three modern Things, and which relate to our own Nation: as,</P>
<P N="1">1. That of Hart-Horn Tree, where they &s;hew'd us the Head of a Stag nail'd up again&s;t a Tree, or rather &s;hew'd us the Tree where they &s;aid it was nail'd up, in Memory of a famous Cha&s;e of a Stag by one &s;ingle Dog. It &s;eems the Dog (not a Greyhound, as Mr. Camb|den's Continuator calls it, but a &s;tanch Buck hound, to be &s;ure) &s;ingly cha&s;s'd a Stag from this Place, (Whitfield Park) as far as the Red Kirk in Scotland, which, they &s;ay, is &s;ixty Miles at lea&s;t, and back again to the &s;ame Place, where, be|ing both &s;pent, and at the la&s;t Ga&s;p, the Stag &s;train'd all its Force remaining to leap the Park Pales, did it, and dy'd on the in&s;ide; the Hound, attempting to leap after him, had not Strength to get over, but fell back, and dy'd on the Out&s;ide ju&s;t oppo&s;ite; after which the Heads of both were nail'd up upon the Tree, and this Di&s;tich made on them; the Hound's Name, it &s;eems, was Hercules.</P>
<Q><L>Hercules kill'd Hart a Gree&s;e,</L>
<L>And Hart a Gree&s;e kill'd Hercules.</L></Q>
<P N="2">2. Another thing they told us was in the &s;ame Park, viz. three Oak Trees which were call'd The Three Brether, the lea&s;t of which was thirteen Yards about; but they own'd there was but one of them left, and only the Stump of that; &s;o we did not think it worth going to &s;ee, becau&s;e it would no more confirm the Wonder, than the Peoples affirming it by Tradition only. The Tree or Stump left, is call'd The Three Brether Tree, that is to &s;ay, one of the three Bro|thers, or Brethren.</P>
<P N="3">3. We&s;t of this Hart&punc;horn Tree, and upon the Roman Way, is the famous Column, called the Counte&s;s Pillar, the be&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful Piece of its kind in Britain. It is a fine Column of Free-Stone, finely wrought enchas'd, and in &s;ome places Painted. There is an Obe|li&s;k on the Top, &s;everal Coats of Arms and other Ornaments in proper Plac$ all over it, with Dials al&s;o on every $word$ and a Bra&s;s Plate with the following $t &s;cription upon it:</P>
<P>This Pillar was erected Anno $word$ by the Right Honourable, Anne, $word$ Dowager of Pembroke, and $word$ Heir of the Right Honourable Georg$ Earl of Cumberland, &amp;c. For a Mem$|rial of her la&s;t parting in this $word$ with her good and pious Mother, $word$ Right Honourable Margarete, $word$ Dowager of Cumberland, the 2d of $pril 1616: In Memory whereof $word$ al&s;o left an Annuity of <HI>4</HI> l. to be d$$$$buted to the `Poor&punc; within this Pari&s;h Brougham every &s;econd Day of Apr for ever, upon the Stone Table hereby.</P>
<P>This Counte&s;s of Pembroke had a $word$ and great E&s;tate in this County, $word$ a great many fine old Seats or Palac$ all which &s;he repaired and beautified, $span$ &s;ometimes at one, and &s;ometim$ at another, for the Benefits of her $word$ and of the Poor, who &s;he alway made de&s;irous of her Pre&s;ence, being $word$ con&s;tantly by her Bounty, and $word$ noble Hou&s;e-keeping. But tho&s;e $word$ are all &s;ince that Time gone into $word$ Families.</P>
<P>This Lady was of the Family of $word$ &s;he had no le&s;s than four $word$ in this County, of which Pe$idrag$$ C$|&s;tle was the chief, which is a fine $word$ to this Day.</P>
<P N="14">4. At Penrith al&s;o we &s;aw &s;everal $word$ markble Things, &s;ome of which I $word$ mentioned by the Right Rev$tend Con|tinuator of Mr. Can$bden, and which was glad to &s;ee, &s;o confirm'd my Ob|&s;ervation viz. (1.) Two $span$ 14 or 15 Foot $word$ and $word$ $word$ high the lowe&s;t of them, though $span$ The People told us, they were the $word$ of Sir Owen $word$ the $word$ above-nam'd calls him, Sir Ewen $word$ and perhaps he may be right: $word$ we have no In&s;cription upon them. $word$
<PB REF="441">
Sir Owen, they tell us was a Champion of mighty Strength, and gyganti$k Sta|ture, and &s;o he was, to $e &s;ure, if, as they &s;ay, he was as tall as o$e of the Columns, a$$ could touch both Pillars with his Hand at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>They relate nothing but good of him, and t$at he exerted his mighty Strength to kill Robbers, &s;uch as infe&s;ted the Bor|ders much in tho&s;e Days, others related $wld Boars; but the former is mo&s;t pro|bable $2.) On the North &s;ide of the Ve&s;try of this Church is erected in the Wall an ancient &s;quare Stone, with a Me|morial, intimating, that in the Year 1598 $here was a dreadful Plague in tho&s;e Parts, in which there dy'd;

<P>N. B By this Account it &s;hould &s;eem $hat every one of tho&s;e Towns had &s;epa|ately more People, than the City of Carli&s;le, and that Kendal, which is the $nly manufacturing Town of them, was he mo&s;t populous. We did not go into $he $word$ to on the Bank of the River $word$ of which mention is made by Mr. $word$ Conti$$ator, the People tell|ng us, the Pa&s;&s;age is $$ock'd up with $a$th, &s;o I mu&s;t be content with telling $ou that it &s;eems to have been a lurk|$g Place, or Retreat of &s;ome Robbers $word$ old T m e; as to its being a Place of $word$ I do not &s;ee any Po&s;&s;io$lity of $word$ but its Strength &s;eems to be chiefly $word$ being &s;ecret and conc$$led; $word$ it had certainly been worth &s;ee|$g, it if had been pa&s;&s;abl$, the Entry $word$ and dark, but whether &s;$$a t or $word$ I cannot &s;ay, the $$on Gates $ading to it are gone nor is there any $word$ of them, or what they were hung $word$.</P>
<P>But though I am backward to dip in|to Antiquity, yet no Engli&s;h Man, that has any Honour for the glorious Memory of the greate&s;t and true&s;t Hero of all our Kings of the Engli&s;h or Saxon Race, can go to Carli&s;le, and not &s;tep a&s;ide to &s;ee the Monument of King Edward I. at Burgh upon the Sands, a little Way out of the City Carli&s;le, where that victorious Prince dy'd. Indeed I cannot wonder that two Writers, both Scots, viz. R$dpath and Mr. Kay, &s;hould leave it, as i$ were, not worth their Notice, that Prince being the Terror of Scotland, and the fir&s;t compleat Conqueror of their Kingdom, who brought away the &s;acred Scone at Scone-Abbey, on which their Kings were crown|ed, al&s;o the Regalia, and in a Word, made their whole Country &s;ubmit to his victo|rious Arms.</P>
<P>Near this Town, and, as the inhabi|tants affirm, ju&s;t on the &s;pot where the King's Tent &s;tood in which he expired, for he died in the Camp, is erected a Pil|lar of Stone near thirty Foot high, be&s;ides the Foundation. On the We&s;t Side is the following in&s;cription:</P>
<P>Memoriae Aeternae Edvardi I. Regis Angliae longe Clari&s;&s;imi, qui in Belli apparatu contra Scotes occupatus. Hie in Ca&s;tris obiit. <HI>7</HI> Julii, A. D. <HI>1307.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On the South Side:</HI> Nobili&s;&s;imus Princeps Hearicus Howard, Dux N$$f$lciae Comes Mar&s;hal An gl$ae, Com s $r und, &amp;c.&mdash;ab Ed$ardo I, Rege Angl$ae $word$ P. <HI>1685.</HI></P>

<P>It is not to be ask'd why Mr. Camb|pen takes no Notice of this, becau&s;e it was not erected till near an hundred Years af|ter his Sur vey of the Country, only the Place was marked by the Country People, or per|haps by the Soldiers of his Army, by a

great heap of Stones rolled together upon the Place; but this Monument was erect|ed, as is &s;aid above, by a private Gentle|man, for the eternal Memory of a Prince, who, when he lived, was the Darling of the World, both for Virtue and true Fame.</P>
<P>But I return to Carli&s;le: The City is &s;trong, but &s;mall, the Buildings old, but the Streets fair; the great Church is a venerable old Pile, it $word$ to have been built at twice, or&punc; as it were rebuilt, the upper Part being much more modern than the lower.</P>
<P>King Henry VIII fortiyfy'd this City again&s;t the Scots, and built an additional Ca&s;tle to it on the Ea&s;t Side, which Mr. Cambden, though I think not ju&s;tly calls a Cit$adel; there is indeed another Ca&s;tle on the We&s;t Part of the Town rounds th$ Sea, as the Wall rounds the whole, is very firm and &s;trong But Carli&s;le is &s;trong by Situation, being almo&s;t &s;ur|rounded with Rivers. On the Ea&s;t it has the River Poterell, on the North Eden, and on the South the Cande, or Canda, or Calda, which all fall into the Arm of the Sea, which they call the Solway, or Firth.</P>
<P>Here is a Bridge over the Eden, which &s;oon lets you into Scotland; for the Limits are not above eight Miles off&punc; or thereabout. The South Part of Scotland on this Side, coming at lea&s;t fifty Miles farther into England, than at Berwick. There is not a great deal of Trade here either by Sea or Land, it being a meer Frontier. On the other Side the Eden we &s;aw the Picts Wall, of which I have &s;poken already, and &s;ome Remains of it are to be &s;een farther We&s;t, and of which I &s;hall perhaps have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak again in my Return. But being now at the utmo&s;t Extent of England on this Side, I conclude al&s;o my Tenth Jour|ney.</P>

<DIV1>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION TO THE ACCOUNT, AND De&s;cription, of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO all the De&s;criptions of Scotland, which have been publi&s;h'd in our Day, have been written by Natives of that Country, and that with &s;uch an Air of the mo&s;t &s;candalous Partiality, that it has been far from plea&s;ing the Gentry or No|bility of Scotland them&s;elves, and much farther has it been from doing any Ho|nour to the Nation or the Country.</P>
<P>One known Author has taken Pains to de&s;cribe their Commerce as an immen&s;e Thing for Magnitude, has &s;et off their Manufactures in &s;uch a Figure, and as &s;uch
<PB REF="445">
extraordinary Things, that the Engli&s;h are Trifles to them, and their merchan|dizing, according to his Account, mu&s;t be inferior to very few, if any Nation in Europe; nay, he is not a&s;ham'd to give us an Account of the Particulars of their Exportations to China and the Ea&s;t Indies, to Turkey, and the Levant, where, I be|lieve, never Scots Ship yet &s;ail'd, unle&s;s it was in the Service of Engli&s;h Mer|chants, or &s;ome other foreign Nation.</P>
<P>A more modern, and, I mu&s;t acknow|ledge, more mode&s;t Writer than this, knowing he could not, with a Front that, perhaps, he had not yet arrived to, &s;et forth his Country to her Advantage, by giving a real De&s;cription of that Part which would nece&s;&s;arily &s;hew her Defici|encies, as well as her Beauties; and re|taining &s;till that Piece of Northern Vani|ty peculiar to the Climate, to think mighty well of his own Country, takes up with de&s;cribing the Seats of the Nobility and Gentry; a Subject, which, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;s'd, gives him a greater Scope, and in which he has good Materials to work on: $ut, even in this, it mu&s;t be added he $ould have done better, if he would $ave given the Noblemen and Gentlemen $f Scotland leave to have known their $wn Hou&s;es again, when they &s;aw his $e&s;cription of them.</P>
<P>I have &s;o much Honour for the Noble|men and Gentlemen of Scotland, that I $word$ per&s;uaded they will be as well pleas'd $word$ &s;ee Ju&s;tice done them and their Coun|$y, as to &s;ee them&s;elves flatter'd, and the $orld impos'd upon about them. Their $untry is not &s;o void of Beauty, or their $r&s;ons of Merit, as to want; and (I be|$ve) they will not &s;eek to be flatter'd, $word$ be obliged by it, when 'tis attemp|d</P>
<P>But be that as it will, the World &s;hall, $word$ once, hear what Account an English-$n &s;hall give of Scotland, who has had $a&s;ion to &s;ee mo&s;t of it, and to make $ical Enquiries into what he has not $word$ and, if de&s;cribing it, as it really is, $word$ as in Time it may be, with probable Rea&s;ons for the Variation, will give Satis|faction to the Scots. They will be oblig|ed; on the contrary I &s;hall neither flatter them or deceive them. Scotland is here de&s;crib'd with Brevity, but with Ju&s;tice; and the pre&s;ent $word$ of Things there, placed in as clear a $span$ as the Sheets, I am confined to, wil$ $word$ if this plea&s;es, mo$e $span$ may be adventured on hereafter; if it &s;hould not, it would make me &s;u&s;pect the other Authors I have men|tioned knew what would plea&s;e their Country-men better tha$ I; But I mu&s;t run the Venture of that, rather than tre&s;|pa&s;s upon my own Truth and their Mo|de&s;ty.</P>
<P>I hope it is no Reflection upon Scot|land to &s;ay they are where we were, I mean as to the Improvement of their Country and Commerce; and they may be where we are.</P>
<P>Here are but a few Things needful to bring Scotland to be (in many Parts of it at lea&s;t) as rich in Soil, as fruitful, as po|pulous, as full of Trade, Shipping, and Wealth, as mo&s;t, if not as the be&s;t Coun|ties of England. The&s;e few Things, in|deed, are &s;uch as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and, perhaps, as Things &s;tand, may be difficult: Such as</P>
<P N="1">1. Time, publick Changes cannot be brought about in a Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Change in the Di&s;po&s;ition of the common People, from a De&s;ire of travelling abroad, and wandring from Home, to an indu&s;trious and diligent Application to Labour at Home.</P>
<P N="3">3. Stock and Sub&s;tance, to encourage that Application: Sloth is not a meer Di&s;ea&s;e of the Nation: The Scots are as diligent, as indu&s;trious, as apt for Labour and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and as ca|pable of it, when they are abroad, as any People in the World; and why &s;hould they not be &s;o at Home? and, if they had Encouragement, no doubt they would.</P>
<P N="4"><PB REF="446" MS="Y">
4. Some little Alteration in their Me|thods of Husbandry, by which their Lands would be improv'd, and the Produce thereof turn better to Ac|count; of all which &s;omething may be &s;aid in our Progre&s;s thro' the Country, as Occa&s;ion pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as I &s;hall not make a Paradi&s;e of Scotland, &s;o I a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hall not make a Wilderne&s;s of it. I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew you what it really is, what it might be, and what, perhaps, it would much &s;ooner have been, if &s;ome People's Engagements were made good to them, which were lu&s;tily promi&s;ed a little before the Union: Such as erect|ing Manufactures there under Engli&s;h Direction, embarking Stocks from Eng|land to carry on Trade, employing Hands to cut down their Northern Woods, and make Navigations to bring the Firr Tim|ber, and Deals to England, of which Scot|land is able to furni&s;h an exceeding Quan|tity; encouraging their Fi&s;hery, and abun|dance of fine Things mote which were much talked of I &s;ay, but little down; and of which I could &s;ay more, but it is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Work, nor per|haps, will the Age care to hear it, at lea&s;t, South by <HI>Tw</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, therefore, be contented to give an Account of Scotland in the pre&s;ent State of it, and as it really is; leaving its Misfortunes, and Want of being im|prov'd as it might be, and, perhaps, ought to have been, for tho&s;e to con&s;ider of, in who&s;e Power it is to mend it.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY XI.</HEAD>
<P>I Am now ju&s;t entered Scotland, and that by the ordinary Way from Ber|wick. We tread upon Scots Ground, after about three Miles riding be|yond Berwick; the little Di&s;trict between, they &s;ay, is neither in England or Scot|land, and is call'd Berwick&s;hire, as being formerly a Dependant upon the Town of Berwick; but we find no Towns in it, only &s;trangling Farm Hou&s;es; and one &s;ees the Tweed on one Side, which fetches a Reach Northward, the Sea on the other, and the Land between lies &s;o high, that in &s;tormy Weather 'tis very bleak and unplea&s;ant; however, the Land is good, and compar'd to our next View, we ought to think very well of it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Town in Scotland is called Mordintown, where the Mini&s;ter, at that Time, was a Man of Learning, particu|larly in Matters of religious Antiquity, and very well known for being Author of a Book, Entituled, The <HI>Cyprtanick</HI> Age, in Defence of the Scots Doctrines of the Purity of the Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters; a Peice, that &s;hews the Author a Man of a good &s;hare of Learning, and a double Stock of Reading, e&s;pecially in the mo&s;t valuable Part of Church Antiquity: His Name is Lauder.</P>
<P>Mordintown lying to the We&s;t, the great Road does not lie thro' it, but carries us to the Brow of a very high Hill, where we had a large View into Scotland: But we were welcom'd into it with &s;uch a Scots Gale of Wind, that, be&s;ides the Steepne&s;s of the Hill, it ob|liged us to quit our Hor&s;es, for real Ap|prehen&s;ions
<PB REF="447">
of being blown off, the Wind blowing full North, it blew directly in our Faces: And I can truly &s;ay, I never was &s;en&s;ible of &s;o fierce a Wind, &s;o ex|ceeding keen and cold, for it pierc'd our very Eyes, that we could &s;carcely bear to hold them open.</P>
<P>When we came down the Hill, the Strength of the Wind was not felt &s;o much, and con&s;equently, not the Cold. The fir&s;t Town we come to is as perfect+ly Scots, as if you were 100 Miles North off Edinburgh; nor is there the lea&s;t Ap|pearance of any Thing Engli&s;h, either in Cu&s;toms, Habits, U&s;ages of the People, or in their Way of Living, Eating, Dre&s;s, or Behaviour; any more than if they had never heard of an Engli&s;h Nation; nor was there an Engli&s;hman to be &s;een, or any Engli&s;h Family to be found among them.</P>
<P>On the contrary, you have in Eng|land abundance of Scot&s;men&punc; Scots Cu|&s;toms, Words, Habits, and U&s;ages, even more than becomes them; nay, even the Buildings in the Towns and Villages, i$$tate the Scots all over Northumber|land; witne&s;s their building the Hou&s;es with the Stairs (to the &s;econd Floor) going up on the Out&s;ide of the Hou&s;e, &s;o that one Family may live below, and another above, without going in at the &s;ame Door; which is the Scots Way of Living, and which we &s;ee in Alnwick and Warkworth, and &s;everal other Towns; witne&s;s al&s;o their &s;etting their Corn up in great Numbers of &s;mall Stacks with|o$t Doors, not making U&s;e of any Barns, only a particular Building, which they call a Barn, but, which is it it&s;elf no more than a Thre&s;h ng Floor, into which they take one of tho&s;e &s;mall Stacks at a Time, and thre&s;h it out, and then take in an|other; which we have great Rea&s;on to believe was the U&s;age of the Ancients, &s;eeing we read of Thre&s;hing-Floors of|ten; but very &s;eldom, of a Barn, except that of the rich Glutton.</P>
<P>Being down this Hill, we pa&s;s'd a Bridge over the little River Eye, at the Mouth of which there is a &s;mall Harbour, with a Town call'd Eyemouth, or as &s;ome call it, Heymouth, which has of late been more &s;poken of thau formerly, by giv|ing the Title of Baron to the late Duke of Marlborough, who was Duke of Marl|borough, Marqui&s;s of Blandford, and Ba|ron of Eyemouth in Scotland; and, by virtue of this Title, had a Right of Peer|age in the Parliament of Scotland. But notwith&s;tanding all this, I never heard that he did any Thing for the Town, which is, at pre&s;ent, ju&s;t what it always was, a good fi&s;hing Town, and &s;ome fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els belong to it; for &s;uch it is a good Harbour, and for little el&s;e; in Queen Elizabeth's Time, indeed, the French held it and fortify'd it for their particular Occa&s;ion; becau&s;e, being the fir&s;t Port in Scotland, they might &s;afely land their Supplies for the Queen-Mother, who &s;tood in great Need of their A&s;&s;i&s;|&s;tance again&s;t the Reformers: But they were oblig'd to quit both that and all the Kingdom &s;ome Time after, by a Treaty; Queen Elizabeth &s;upporting the Reform|ers again&s;t her.</P>
<P>From this Bridge we enter upon a mo&s;t de&s;olate, and, in Winter a mo&s;t fright|ful Moor for Travellers, e&s;pecially Stran|gers, call'd Condingham, or, to &s;peak properly, Coldingham Moor; upon which, for about eight Miles, you &s;ee hardly a Hedge, or a Tree, except in one Part, and that at good Di&s;tance; nor do you meet with but one Hou&s;e in all the Way, and that no Hou&s;e of Entertainment; which, we thought, was but a poor Re|ception for Scotland to give her Neigh|bours, who were Strangers, at their very fir&s;t Entrance into her Bounds.</P>
<P>The Place call'd Condingham, from whence this Moor derives, is an old Mo|na&s;tery, famous before the Reformation; the Monks of Coldingham being eminent for their Number and Wealth; as for any Thing el&s;e, this Deponent &s;aith not.</P>
<P>Here was formerly a little Cell, or reli|gious Hou&s;e al&s;o, &s;acred to the Me$ory of St Ebbe, or Ebb$, Daughter of King Edel|f$id, King of Northumberland; who, her Father being taken Pri&s;oner by the Pagan Mercians, got into a Boat in the Hum|ber, with 3 Women, and by their Prayers,
<PB REF="448">
for Skill we may &s;uppo&s;e, they had none, nor could they labour much; yet, put|ting to Sea, were miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erv'd, and carry'd as far as Scotland; where, under a great Promontory, they were driven on Shore by a Storm, and their Boat da&s;h'd in Pieces, as, indeed, any one, though knowing the Place, might very well be, for the Shore is all Rock and high Precipices for a long Way.</P>
<P>However, being on Shore, they labour|ed with their Hands, made them&s;elves a little Hut to lodge in, and continu$$g their devour Prayers, the Country Peo|ple &s;u&s;tained them with Food, $word$ at $span$ an Opinion for their $span$ they were $span$ near for their Prayers, and, by $span$ of the People, got enough to $span$ Hou&s;e at Colding+ham.</P>
<P>Here, $word$ $word$ &s;ays, when the cruel Danes came $word$ Shore&punc; the religious La|dy, who was wondrous beautiful too, it &s;eems, cut off her No&s;e and upper Lip, and made all her Nuns do the &s;ame, to pre&s;erve, by that Means, their Cha&s;tity. But the barbarous Danes, enraged at them for their Zeal, fir'd their Nunnery, and burnt them all alive; from this Lady, who, it is &s;aid, was &s;ainted for the&s;e Mi|racles, the Promontory, where &s;he land|ed, is to this Day called St. Ebba's Head; and vulgarly by our Sailors who nick|name every Thing, St. Tabbs.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;s'd this De&s;art, which in|deed, makes a Stranger think Scotland a terrible Place, you come down a very &s;teep Hill into the Lothains, &s;o the Coun|ties are divided, and they are &s;poken of in plural; becau&s;e as York&s;hire is divided into the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Riding, &s;o here is the Ea&s;t, and We&s;t, and Mid Lothain, or Louthain, and therefore ju&s;tly called Lo|thains in the plural,</P>
<P>From the Top of this Hill you begiu to &s;ee that Scotland is not all De&s;art; and the Low Lands, which then &s;how them|&s;elves, give you a Pro&s;pect of a fruitful and plea&s;ant Country: As &s;oon as we come down the Hill, there is a Village called Cockburn&s;peth, vulgarly $word$ where Nature forms a very $word$ and difficult Pa&s;s, and where, indeed, $word$ Thou&s;and Men well furni&s;hed, $span$ doing their Duty, would keep out an Army, if there was Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Gentleman's Hou&s;e we met with in Scotland was that of $word$ the Seat of Sir James $ all; a $span$ ho&s;pitable, &s;o $span$ addicted to improve and $span$ and under&s;tood it $span$ that we b$g n to &s;ee h re a $span$ of the Gentry $span$ whom, I mu&s;t &s;ay, $span$ none in Europe, under&s;tand $word$ better, or better de&s;erve the $word$ $word$ Gentlemen. We began al&s;o to $word$ $word$ Scotland was not &s;o naturally ba$$$n, a$ &s;ome People repre&s;ent it, but, with Ap+plication and Judgment, in the $word$ Methods of improving Lands, might $word$ made to equal, not England only, $word$ even the riche&s;t, mo&s;t fruitful, mo&s;t ple$+&s;ant and b &s;t im$$ov$d Part of England Nor, if I wave any Skill in the Nature $word$ improving Lands, which $ a little prete$$ to, or Judgment of what Land it&s;elf capable of i$ the County of Middlere$ or F$rt$ord&s;hire, which is e&s;teemed $word$ mo&s;t completely improved Part of $word$ land, and the riche&s;t Soil, capable of $word$ Improvement, which this Country $word$ $word$ Lothain is not al&s;o capable o$, $span$ the &s;ame Methods of improvement $word$ the Scots were as good $span$ the Engli&s;h; and even this too $word$ ea&s;ily be brought to pa&s;s, would $word$ Gentlemen &s;et about it, as this $word$ man has, in Part, already don$, at $word$ own expence.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Soil hereabout very good; and tho' they have not $word$ or Chalk, or much Lun$$&s;t$$e and manure it, yet, the Sea&punc;wa$$, as $word$ call the Weeds, which the Sea ca&s;ts $word$ abundantly &s;upplies; and by l$ying $word$ continually on the Land, they $$ow $word$ Year without laying their Lands fall$$
<PB REF="449">
as we do; and I found they had as much Corn, as our Plowmen expre&s;s it, as could &s;tand upon the Ground.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Town of Note, from hence, is Dunbar, a royal Burgh, $word$ they are cal|led in Scotland, which is (much what) we call a Corporation in England, and which &s;ent $span$ as our Corporations in England $span$ in Scotland, as is generally $span$ &s;tood, they had &s;ome $span$ &s;eparate to them&s;elves; $span$ Ex|ample, of holding a $span$ of Burghs by $span$ Me|thod taken from the Union $span$ Hans-Towns in the North, and $span$ un|like it, in which they mee$ $span$ Mea&s;ures for the publick Good of the Town, and of their Trade, and make By|laws, or Acts, and Declarations, which bind the whole Body.</P>
<P>Nor have they lo&s;t this Privilege by the Union with England; but it is pre&s;erved entire, and, perhaps, is now many Ways more advantagious to them than it was before, as their Trade is like to be, in Time, more con&s;iderable than before</P>
<P>This Town of Dunbar is a hand&s;ome well-built Town, upon the Sea-&s;hore; where they have a kind of a natural Har|bour, tho' in the Middle of dangerous Rocks.</P>
<P>They have here a great Herring Fi&s;hery. and particularly they hang Herrings here, as they do at Yarmouth in Norfolk, for the &s;moking them; or, to &s;peak the ordi|nary Dialect, they make red Herrings here: I cannot &s;ay they are cur'd &s;o well as at Yarmouth; that is to &s;ay, not for keeping and &s;ending on long Voyages, as to Venice and Leghorn, though, with a quick Pa&s;&s;age, they might hold it thither too: However, they do it very well. The Herrings al&s;o them&s;elves may a little make the Difference, becau&s;e they are generally larger and fatter than tho&s;e at Ya$mouth, which makes it more difficult to cure them, &s;o as to keep in a hot Country, and on a long Voyage.</P>
<P>Between the Town and the great Road &s;tands a little, but plea&s;ant and agreeable Seat of the Duke of Roxburgh, with a Park well planted: And as the Gentle|men of Scotland are now &s;et upon plant|ing Fore&s;t Trees, as well for Ornament as Profit. This Park is, among the re&s;t, very hand&s;omely planted with young Trees in Vi&s;ta's and Walks, and will, when grown, add both to the Value and Beauty of the Seat&punc; which otherwi&s;e is but as a Box. And here I would give an u&s;eful Hint to the Gentlemen who plant Trees in Scotland, the Want of which I have ob&s;erved at &s;everal great Hon&s;es and Parks in that Country, is the Rea&s;on why they do not thrive, as they might other|wi&s;e do: The Ca&s;e is this.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen, at a great Expence, get Quantities of Fore&s;t Trees, either of their own rai&s;ing, or from the Nur&s;ery|men; as they call them in England. Tho&s;e are &s;et at a good Length, perhaps, 12 to 15 Foot high, hand&s;ome Bodies, and good Heads; and I acknowledge they are the be&s;t &s;iz'd Trees to plant, and that when &s;et younger they &s;eldom &s;tand it or come to the like Perfection: But then the&s;e Trees &s;hould be all &s;ecured by a triangular Frame to each Tree; that is to &s;ay, three large Stakes &s;et about them in an equil|ateral Triangle, and &s;a&s;tened all together by three &s;hort cro&s;s Pieces at the Top; and the&s;e Stakes &s;hould &s;tand from 7 to 8 Foot high.</P>
<P>In the Center of the Triangle &s;tands the planted Tree; which Way &s;oever the Wind blows, the Body bends from it to the cro&s;s Piece, which joins the Stakes on that &s;ide, and which make the Trian|gle, and then can bend no farther; by which Means the Root is not &s;haken, or the Earth mov'd and loo&s;en'd about it, and then the Tree will &s;trike Root, and grow.</P>
<P>But for Want of this, the Tree being left without Support, before, as we may &s;ay, it can &s;tand alone; and the Winds, e&s;pecially, in Winter, being very &s;trong in that Country, the Tree is bended every
<PB REF="450">
Way; the Earth loo&s;en'd continnally a|bout it, the Root is often &s;tirr'd, and the Tree gets on Time to &s;trike Root into the Earth. And this is the Rea&s;on why, in many of the Gentlemens Parks, I &s;aw the Trees &s;tented and bauk'd; and that, tho' they had been planted many Years, they could not thrive: If this Caution may be of U&s;e, as I recommend it with a De&s;ire it may, the Gentleman will not think their Time l$&s;t in the reading it.</P>
<P>On the South We&s;t Side of this Town, under the Mountains near a l la$e call'd Dun Hil$&punc; is the fatal Field where the Bat|tel, call'd the Battle of Dunbar, was fought, between Oliver Cromwell and General Le&s;ly, who then commanded the Royal Army; where the de&s;perate Few, for Cromwells Army, was not a|bove 8$00 Men de&s;eated and totally overthrew the great Army of the other Side, kill'd 6000, and took 10,000 Pri&s;o|ners, to the Surprize of the World; but that is Matter of Hi&s;tory, and none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Here we turn'd out of the Way to &s;ee the Marque&s;s of Tweedel's fine Park, and which is, indeed, the main Thing, his fine planting at Ye&s;ter, or, as Antigui|ty calls it, Ze&s;tor; I &s;ay the Park, be|cau&s;e, tho' there is the De&s;ign of a noble Hou&s;e or Pal ce, and great Part of it built; yet, as it is not yet, and perhaps, will not &s;oon be fini&s;hed, there is no giving a compleat De&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>The old Earl of Tweedale, who was a great Favourite of King Charles II. tho' uot much concern'd in politic af|fairs, at lea&s;t, not in England, yet took in from the King the Love of managing what we call Fore&s;t Trees, and making &s;ine Vi&s;ta's and Avenues: The very fir&s;t Year after the Re&s;toration the King laid out, with his own Hand, the planting of Greenwich and St. James's Parks, and &s;everal others, and the &s;aid Earl had &s;een them and was extremely delighted with the Method.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ioned his Lord&s;hip, as &s;oon as he went down into Scotland, to lay out the Plan and De&s;ign of all tho&s;e no|ble Walks and Woods of Trees, or, as it might be call'd, Fore&s;ts of Trees, which he afterwards &s;aw planted, and of which a Gentleman, who&s;e Judgment I cannot doubt, told me, that if ever tho&s;e Trees came to be worth but &s;ix Pence a Tree, they would be of more Value than the Fee Simple of that E&s;tate; not mean ng by that E&s;tate the Land they grew o$, but the whole paternal E&s;tate of the Fa|mily: Nor is it unlikely, if it be true, that his Lord&s;hip, and his immediate Suc|ce&s;&s;or, planted above 6000 Acres of La$$ all full of Firr-Trees; and that, wherever it found that any Tree fail'd, they were con&s;tantly renew'd the next Year.</P>
<P>It is certain, that many of the Trees are, by this Time, of much more Value than &s;ix Pence a Tree is but a &s;low Grow|er, and that mo&s;t, if not all the Tree I &s;p$ak of, are Firr; yet it mu&s;t be al|llow'd, that, the Trees thriving very $word$ they mu&s;t, by this Time, be very valu|able; and if they &s;tand another Age, and we do not find the Family $word$ of Money enough to make them for|ward to cut any of them down, there may be a noble E&s;tate in Fi$r Timber$ enough, if it falls into good Hands, to enrich the Family.</P>
<P>The Park it&s;elf is &s;aid to be eight Miles about, but the Plantation of $word$ not &s;imply con&s;in'd to the Park, no$ in|deed, to this E&s;tate; for the Family $word$ Tweedale has another Seat near $word$ at Pinkey, where the $ame $word$ planted al&s;o a great Number of Tree as his Succe&s;&s;ors have likewi&s;e $span$ another Seat, which they have in $word$ near Aberdour.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e, however, mu&s;t not b$ forgot; and if it &s;hall be fini&s;hed, as they now tell us it will &s;oon be, it will not $word$ it&s;elf to be forgot, for there will $word$ finer Palaces in Scotland; I mean $word$ $word$ b$ fini&s;h'd according to the Magnificence $word$ the fir&s;t De&s;ign.</P>
<P>As the Succe&s;s of this Planting is great Encouragement to the Nobility Scotland to improve their E&s;tates by $word$ &s;ame Method, &s;o we find abundance
<PB REF="451">
Gentlemen of E&s;tates do fall into it, and follow the Example: And you hard|ly &s;ee a Gentleman's Hou&s;e, as you pa&s;s the Louthains, towards Edinburgh, but they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Groves and Walks of Firr-Trees about them; which, tho' in mo&s;t Places they are but young, yet they &s;hew us, that in a few Years, Scot|$and will not need to &s;end to Norway $or Timber and Deal, but will have &s;uf|$icient of her own, and perhaps, be able $o furni&s;h England too with con&s;iderable Quantities.</P>
<P>We &s;aw an Example of this at the Earl $f Haddington's Hou&s;e at Tinningham; where, tho' the Trees are younger than $t Ye&s;ter, yet, they &s;eem to follow them $pace, and to thrive &s;o much, as that $hey may&punc; one Time or other, overtake $hem. The like we &s;aw in Fife, at Sir William Bruce's, and at &s;everal other Pla|$es in this Part of the Country.</P>
<P>From this Town of Dunbar to Edin|$urgh, the Country may be reckoned $ot only as frutiful and rich in Soil, but $&s;o as plea&s;ant and agreeable a Country $word$ any in Scotland, and, indeed, as mo&s;t $word$ England, the Sea on the right Hand at moderate Di&s;tance, and the Hills on $$e left, at a farther Di&s;tance; and even $ho&s;e Hills not extremely high not ar$en, not de&s;olate Mountains, as I $ave given an Account of &s;ome farther $outh, and I have more to &s;peak of far|$her North. But the&s;e Hills are pa&s;&s;able $nd habitable, and have large Flocks of $heep in many Places, feeding on them, $nd many open Roads lie over them, $s from Edinburgh, and other Parts to|$ards England, as particularly to Ye&s;ter, $nd to Duns and Cold&s;tream on the $word$ weed; another Way to Kel&s;oe, where $&s;o there is a Ford and a Ferry over the $word$ weed, and likewi&s;e by another Way to $iviotdale, to Peebles and Jedburgh, of $hich hereafter&punc;</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Thing this Country wants $word$ more enclos'd Pa&s;tures, by which the $atmers would keep Stocks of Cattle $ell fodder'd in the Winter, and, which $gain, would not only furni&s;h good &s;tore of Butter, Chee&s;e, and Beef to the Mar|ket, but would, by their Quantity of Dung, enrich their Soil, according to the un|an&s;werable Maxim in Grazing, that Stock upon Land improves Land.</P>
<P>Two other Articles would encrea&s;e and enrich them, but which they never practi&s;e&punc;</P>
<P N="1">1. Folding their Sheep.</P>
<P N="2">2. Fallowing their plow'd Land.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t would fatten the Land, and the latter de&s;troy the Weeds: But this is go|ing out of my Way. They have, indeed, near the Sea, an Equivalent which a&s;&s;i&s;ts them exceedingly, namely, the Sea Weed, they call it the Sea Ware, which the Sea ca&s;ts up from about November to January in great Quantities, and which extremely fattens and enriches the Lands, &s;o that they are plow'd from Age to Age without laying fallow: But farther from the Sea, and where they cannot fetch it, there they are forced to lay the Lands down to re&s;t; when, as we &s;ay in England, they have plow'd them out of Heart, and &s;o they get no Advantage by them; whereas could they&punc; by a Stock of Cattle, rai&s;e a Stock, of Muck, or by folding. Sheep upon them, mend them that Way, and lay them down one Year in three or four, as we do in England, the Lands would hold from one Genera|tion to another.</P>
<P>But at pre&s;ent, for want of Enclo&s;ures, they have no Winter Provi&s;ion for black Cattle; and, for want of that Winter-Provi&s;ion, the Farmers have no Daries, no Butter or Chee&s;e; that is to &s;ay, no Quantity, and no Heaps of Dung in their Yards to return upon the Land for its Im|provement: And thus a good Soil is im|poveri&s;hed for want of Husbandry.</P>
<P>I deliver this once for all; for I &s;hall make all my farther Ob&s;ervations of this Kind very &s;hort, and only proper to the particular Places where I &s;hall mention them.</P>
<P>From Dunbar we pa&s;s another River Tyne, which, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the two Tynes in Northumberland, I call Scots Tyne, tho' not forgetting to let you know it is not &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed there, the Inhabi|tants thereabouts &s;carce knowing any other.
<PB REF="452">
It ri&s;es in the Hills near Ye&s;ter, and watering Part of the fine and plea&s;ant Vale I mentioned before, runs by Had|dington, an old half ruin'd, yet remain|ing Town; which &s;hews the Marks of decayed Beauty, for it was formerly a large, hand&s;ome, and well built Town, or City rather, and e&s;teemed very &s;trong; for, be&s;ides the Walls of Stone, which were in tho&s;e Times e&s;teemed &s;trong, the Engli&s;h fortifyed it with Lines and Ba&s;|tions, four of which Ba&s;tions were very large, as may be &s;een, by the Remains of them, to this Day; al&s;o they had a large Ditch; as for Counter&s;carps, they were &s;carce known in tho&s;e Times. How|ever, it was &s;o &s;trong, that the Engli&s;h, commanded by an old Soldier, Sir George Wilford, defended it ob&s;tinately again&s;t a great Army of French and Scots, till his Garri&s;on were almo&s;t all &s;wept away by the Plague; and, even then, held out till he was relieved from England, when the Engli&s;h Army quitted the Place, and de|moli&s;hed the Fortifications.</P>
<P>However, Haddington is &s;till a good Town, has &s;ome hand&s;ome Streets, and well built; and they have a good Stone Bridge over the Tyne, tho' the River is but &s;mall The Church was large, but has &s;uffered in the Ruin of the re&s;t, and is but in Part repaired, tho' 'tis &s;till large enough for the Number of Inhabitants; for, tho' the Town is &s;till what may be call'd populous, 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee that it is not like what it has been. There are &s;ome Monuments of the Martlands, anti|ent Lords of this Part of the Country remaining, but as the Choir of the Church is open and defaced, the Monuments of the Dead have &s;uffered with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;aw here &s;omething of a Manufacture, and a Face of Indu&s;try; and it was the fir&s;t that I had &s;een the lea&s;t Appearance of in Scotland, particularly here, was a Woollen Manufacture, erected by a Com|pany, or Corporation, for making Broad Cloths, &s;uch as they called Engli&s;h Cloth. And as they had Engli&s;h Workmen em|ployed, and, which was more than all, Engli&s;h Wooll, they reall made very $word$ Cloth, well mixed, and good $word$ But I cannot &s;ay they made it as $word$ or could bring it &s;o cheap to Market $word$ the Engli&s;h; and this was the Rea$$$ that, tho' before the late Union, the Eng|li&s;h Cloth being prohibited upon &s;ever Penalties, their own Cloth &s;upplied the$ very well; yet, as &s;oon as the Uni$ was made, and by that Means the Eng|li&s;h Trade opened, the Clothiers not Worce&s;ter, and the Counties adjoining &s;uch as Glouce&s;ter and Wilts, brought their Goods, and under&s;elling the Sco$ tho&s;e Manufactories were not able: hold it.</P>
<P>However, as I &s;aid, here was a Woo+len Manufacture, and the People $word$ employed in Spinning, Dying&punc; Weaving &amp;c. they turned their Hands to othe Things; and there is &s;till &s;ome Bu&s;ine$ going on to the Advantage of the Poor Al&s;o upon the Tyne, near Haddington we &s;aw very good Fulling Mills; wh$ ther they &s;till have Employment, I a$ not certain.

<P>At the Mouth of this River &s;tands the Remains of Tantallon Ca&s;tle, mo&s;tly b$|ryed in its own Ruins; it was famous, $word$ the Scots Hi&s;tory, for being the Seat of Rebellion, in the Reign of King James V. And hence came the old, and o$ Fancy among the Soldiers, that the Dru$s beating the Scots March, &s;ay, Ding down Tan-Tallon. That Beat of March being invented by King James the Vth's Soldi|ers (or, perhaps Drummers) when they marched again&s;t the Earl of Angus, who held out Tantallon Ca&s;tle again&s;t the King But this by the Way: Tantallon is now no more a Fortiels, or able to &s;helter at Rebel Army.</P>
<P>Neither is the Ba&s;s worth naming any more, which being a meer Rock, &s;tand|ing high out of the Sea, and in its Situa|tion inacce&s;&s;ible, was formerly made a finall Fortification, rather to prevent its
<PB REF="453">
being made a Retreat for Pyrates and Thieves, than for any U&s;e it could be of to command the Sea: for the Entrance of the Forth, or Firth, is &s;o wide, that Ships would go in and out, and laugh at any Thing that could be offered from the Ba&s;s. The mo&s;t of its modern Fame is contained in two Articles, and neither of them recommend it to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P N="1">1. That after the Re&s;toration under the Reigns of King Charles II. and King James II. it was made a State Pri&s;on, where the poor per|&s;ecuted We&s;tern People, called, in tho&s;e Times, Cameronians, were made clo&s;e Pri&s;oners, and lived mi&s;erably enough, without Hope or Expectati|on of Deliverance, but by Death.</P>
<P N="2">2. That after the Revolution a little de&s;perate Crew of People got Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and, having a large Boat, which they hoi&s;ted up into the Rock, or let down at Plea&s;ure, committed &s;everal Pyracies, took a great many Ve&s;&s;els, and held out the la&s;t of any Place in Great Britain for King James; but their Boat be|ing at la&s;t Seized or otherwi&s;e lo&s;t, they were obliged to &s;urrender.</P>
<P>The Soland Gee&s;e are the principal In|$bitants of this I&s;land, a Fowl rare as the Kind; for they are not found in y Part of Britain, that I can learn&punc; ex|$t here, and at &s;ome of the le&s;&s;er I&s;lands the Orcades, and in the I&s;land of Ailzye, the Mouth of the Clyde. They come certainly at their Sea&s;on, as the Swal|$s or Woodcocks, with this Difference, what the People there tell us may be $$nded on; that they come exactly, to very &s;ame Day of the Month, or, if $word$ change it for Rea&s;ons be&s;t known to $&s;elves, then they keep exactly to the $word$ fixed Day; and &s;o, upon any Alter|$n of their Time, which al&s;o is very $m.</P>
<P>$hey feed on the Herrings, and $word$ 'tis ob&s;erved they came ju&s;t before, or them, and go away, with them al&s;o; tho', 'tis evident, they do not follow them, but go all away to the North, whi|ther, as to that, none knows but them|&s;elves, and he that guides them: As they live on Fi&s;h, &s;o they eat like Fi&s;h, which, together with their being &s;o exceeding fat, makes them, in my Opinion, a very coar&s;e Di&s;h, rank, and ill reli&s;hed, and &s;oon gorging the Stomach. But as they are lock'd upon there as a Dainty, I have no more to &s;ay, all Countries have their &s;e|veral Gu&s;ts and particular Palates. Onions and Garlick were Dainties it &s;eems, in Aegypt, and Hor&s;e-Fle&s;h is &s;o to this Day in Tartary, and much more may a Soland Goo&s;e be &s;o in other Places.</P>
<P>It is a large Fowl, rather bigger than an ordinary Goo&s;e: 'tis Duck&punc;footed&punc; and &s;wims as a Goo&s;e; but the Bill is long, thick, and pointed like a Crane, or Heron, only much thicker, and not above five Inches long. Their laying but one Egg, which &s;ticks to the Rock, and will not fall off, unle&s;s pulled off by Force, and then not to be &s;tuck on again; though we thought them Fictions, yet, being there at the Sea&s;on, we found true; as al&s;o their Hatching, by holding the Egg fa&s;t in their Foot. What Nature meant by giv|ing the&s;e Singularities to a Creature, that has nothing el&s;e in it worth Notice, we cannot determine,</P>
<P>From hence, keeping the Shore of the Firth, or Forth, due We&s;t, we find a Range of large and populous Villages all along the Coa&s;t, almo&s;t to Leith, inter|&s;pers'd, with Abundance of the Hou&s;es of the Nobility and Gentry, at a &s;mall Di&s;tance from them, farther into the Country.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t enter a Caution for your Notice, and plea&s;e to take it here once for all. I am writing a De&s;cription of Places, not of Per&s;ons, giving the pre|&s;ent State of Things, not their Hi&s;tory: And therefore, though in &s;ome Ca&s;es I may &s;tep back into Hi&s;tory, yet, it &s;hall be very &s;eldom, and on extraordinary Occa&s;ions. For Scotland is not &s;o barren of things worth Ob&s;ervation, that wes &s;hould run into Hi&s;tory, and the Genealogie
<PB REF="454">
of Families, the De&s;cription of the Con&s;ti|tution, the Laws, and Manner of Admi|ni&s;tration of Civil Ju&s;tice, Government, and &s;uch Things as are remote from the profe&s;s'd Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Tour. I &s;hall not, therefore, with every Nobleman's Hou&s;e, give a Hi&s;tory of the Family: The No|bility of Scotland are ancient, illu&s;trious, and per&s;onally great, and, if &s;poken of at all, require, and ought to have a full and authentick De&s;cription of their Fa|milies and glorious Ance&s;tors performed by it&s;elf; and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, 'tis great Pity &s;uch a Thing is not undertaken by &s;ome Hands equal to &s;o great a Work, both here and in England al&s;o; for want of which, many, if not mo&s;t of the great Actions of the Nobility and Gentry of the&s;e Kingdoms, are either quite lo&s;t and dropt out $f Knowledge, or are dwindled into Fable and Romance, and, like the Battle of Chevy-Cha&s;e, pre&s;erved only in Ballad and Song.</P>
<P>But I am not to go about this here, tho' I &s;hall, on all Occa&s;ions, give the noble Families a due Homage, and &s;peak of them as they ought to be &s;poken of; yet, as it is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Un|dertaking, you will not expect me to en|ter into the Hi&s;tory of Families, or to look any farther into Per&s;ons than into Things, namely to give an Account of their pre&s;ent Situation and Condition.</P>
<P>In order to this 'tis &s;ufficient to mark, that this Part of the Country is delight|fully &s;pread with the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen; as the Duke of Rox|burgh's at Dunbar, the Earl of Hadding|ton's at Tinningham, both mentioned be|fore; the Lord Bellhaven's at Bellhaven; that of the Family of Dalrymple ennobl'd in the Earl of Stairs, and honoured in &s;everal Branches of that Hou&s;e, the elde&s;t being now Lord Pre&s;ident of their Se&s;|&s;ion, and another lately Lord Advocate, &amp;c. The&s;e about North Berwick, where there is a &s;mall and a tolorable good Market: They have al&s;o in the Neigh|bourhood of this Place &s;everal very fine Seats, and finely planted. The Hou&s;e and E&s;tate of Dirleton, now in the Fa|mily of Nisbet, is in this Part of the Country, and well &s;ituated al&s;o. O$$$|&s;toun, the Seat of the pre&s;ent Lord Ju&s;tice Clerk, of the ancient Hou&s;e of Cock$urn, or, as commonly expre&s;s'd, Coburn.</P>
<P>And I mu&s;t add here, the ancient and noble Hou&s;es of Seaton and Winton: Both the Palaces, for &s;o they de&s;erve to be call'd, of the late Earl of Winton, who did &s;o many weak and ra&s;h Things, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of him, in the Affair of the late Rebellion; and the kinde&s;t Thing can be &s;aid of him now is, to leave it upon Record, that he &s;eem'd to be turn'd in his Head. The Hou&s;es are now in a State of Ruin, and as fine $n E&s;tate, for its Value as any in Scotland, all lying contiguous with it&s;elf, and va|lued at almo&s;t 5000 <HI>l.</HI> Srerling, <HI>per Ann.</HI> be&s;ides; but all now under Forfeiture, and &s;old to the York Buildings Compa|ny. The fine Gates and Stone Wall were demoli&s;hed by the Government, after it had been made a Garri&s;on by the High|landers; who, from hence began their hair-brain'd March to England, which Expediou&s;ly ended at Pre&s;ton, as has been mentioned in my Account of Lan|ca&s;hire. But I return to the Sea Shore as above.</P>
<P>The Towns upon this Coa&s;t, as I &s;aid &s;tand very thick, and here are two or three Articles of Trade which render them more Populous, and more con&s;iderable than they would otherwi&s;e be.</P>
<P N="1">1. There are great Quantities of white Fi&s;h taken and cured upon this Coa&s;t, even within, as well as a$ the Mouth of the Firth; and, as I had Occa&s;ion to in&s;pect this Part, I took Notice the Fi&s;h was very well cur'd merchantable, and fit for Expertation and there was a large Ship at the Time come from London, on Pur+po&s;e to take in a Loading of t$$ Fi&s;h for B$lboa$ in Spain.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is great Plenty of Coal i the Hills, and &s;o near the Sea $
<PB REF="455">
to make the Carriage not difficult; and much of that Coal is carried to Edinburgh, and other Towns about, for Sale.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Coal being thus at Hand, they make very good Salt at almo&s;t all the Towns upon the Shore of the Firth; as at Sea&s;on, Cockenny, Pre&s;ton, and &s;everal others, too many to name: They have a very great Trade for this Salt to Norway, Hamburgh, Bre|men, and the Baltick: And the Num|ber of Ships loaded here yearly with Salt is very con&s;iderable; nay, the Dutch and Bremers in particular, come hither on purpo&s;e to load Salt, as they do on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Firth al&s;o, (viz.) the Shore of Fife, of which I &s;hall &s;peak in its Place.</P>
<P N="4">4 They take great Quantities of Oy|&s;ters upon this Shore al&s;o, with which they not only &s;upply the City of Edinburgh, but they carry abundance of them in large, open Boats, call'd Cobles, as far as Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, from whence they generally bring back Gla&s;s Bottles. But there has, within a few Years, a Bottle-hou&s;e been &s;et up at Leith, which, for a while, work'd with Succe&s;s; al&s;o &s;ome Furnaces were erected at Pre|&s;ton-Pans, one of tho&s;e Villages, for making Flint-Gla&s;s, and other Gla&s;s Water: But I hear they are di&s;conti|nued for want of &s;kilful Hands.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be omitted, that at $word$ of tho&s;e Villages there are little Moles $word$ Harbours, or Peers, and Heads built $word$ at con&s;iderable Expence, for the $word$ the Ships that come to them to load $word$ or other Goods; as at Sea&s;on, $word$ at North Berwick, at Pre&s;ton, and $word$ Places.</P>
<P>We come now to Mu&s;clebro, a large $ough Town and populous, and may, $eed, be &s;aid to be a Clu&s;ter of Towns, $word$ built together into one, namely, $&s;clebro, or Innera&s;k, or innere&s;k, $word$ Fi&s;heraw; all which amount to more than this. Mu&s;clebro, or the main or chief Town of Mu&s;clebro; In|nere&s;k, or that Part of Mu&s;clebro which &s;tands within, or on the inner Side of the River E&s;k, and Fi&s;heraw, or the Row of Hou&s;es where the Fi&s;hermen u&s;ually dwell; for here is &s;till many Fi&s;hermen, and was formerly many, when the Mu&s;|cle Fi&s;hing was counted a valuable Thing; but now 'tis given over, tho' the Mu&s;cles lie on the Shore, and on the Shoals of Sand in the Mouth of this River, in va&s;t Quantities.</P>
<P>The&s;e three Towns together make one large Borough, very populous; for here are thought to be more People than at Haddington. Here al&s;o we &s;aw the Peo|ple bu&s;y on the Woollen Manufacture; and as the Goods they made here were an ordinary Kind of Stuff for poor Peo|ples wearing, we do not find they are our done at all from England, &s;o that the Manufacture is carried on here &s;till with Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>They call this a Sea Port Town; but as their River tho' &s;ometimes &s;till enough of Water, is not Navigable; for, at low Water, People ride over the Mouth of it upon the Sands, and even walk over it; &s;o they do not meddle much with Trading by Sea.</P>
<P>At that Part of the Town called In|ner-E&s;k are &s;ome hand&s;ome Country Hou|&s;es with Gardens, and the Citizens of Edinburgh come out in the Summer and take Lodgings here for the Air, as they do from London at Ken&s;ington Graved-Pits, or at Hamp&s;tead and Highgate</P>
<P>Adjoining to this Part is the other fine Se$$ of the Marque&s;s of Tweedale, called Pinkey, which I mentioned before, and which the Family re&s;ides at, rather than at Ye&s;ter; for tho' Ye&s;ter be the noble&s;t and mo&s;t magnificent Building; yet this is, by far, the mo&s;t agreeable Situation, be&s;ides, the former is not fini&s;hed, nor like to be fini&s;hed in many Years, tho' they were to go fa&s;ter on with it than they do.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Pinkey has a Park, which they call four Miles about, but, I think, is
<PB REF="456">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB REF="457">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB REF="458">
not much above half &s;o much: But the Spi|rit of Planting, which the old Earl of Twee|$$le &s;o happily exerted at Ye&s;ter, &s;hew'd it&s;elf here al&s;o, and an innumberable Mum|ber of Fir Trees, are &s;een here in a very thriving Condition, and promi&s;ing, in Time, to be of an ine&s;timable Value.</P>
<P>As the Hou&s;e at Ye&s;ter is not fini&s;h'd, all the rich Furniture, and e&s;pecially Pictures, of which the &s;ame Earl was a great Col|lector, are lodg'd here; though, 'tis not doubled, they will hereafter be tran&s;pos'd and remov'd to adorn the chief Palace and Man&s;ion of the Family. Here are, indeed, a great many valuable Pieces of Painting&punc; but the Family Pieces are par|ticular, and very remarkable, &s;ome for their Antiquity, and the antient Dre&s;s of the Age they were wrought in, and others, for the Finene&s;s of the Workman&s;hip; as e&s;pecially that of the old Marque&s;s of Tweedale, and his fifteen Children, done after the Manner of that of King Charles I and his Royal Family, which formerly &s;tood at the upper End of the long Gal|lery, at Whitehall. So this &s;tands at the upper End of a large Room, fill d up with other Family Pieces, and takes up one whole Square of the Room.</P>
<P>I cannot dwell upon the re&s;t of the fine Paintings here, it mu&s;t &s;uffice to add, here are a great many, and very good. Here are al&s;o three very fine Altar Pieces, with others of that Kind, &s;uppos'd to belong to private Oratories in Popi&s;h Times, with Pa&s;&s;ion Pieces, and others of that Kind al&s;o.</P>
<P>From hence we have but four Miles to Edinburgh. But, before I go thither, I mu&s;t dip &s;o far into Story, as to ob&s;erve that here it was the famous Battle of Mu&s;|clebro was fought between the Engli&s;h, under the Duke of Somer&s;et, in the Time of King Edward VI. of England, and the Scots Royal Army under the Regent, which was afterwards call'd, the Engli&s;h Way of Wooing: the Quarrel was to ob|tain the young Queen of Scots for a Wife to King Edward, which the Scots Popi&s;h Party$ back'd by the French, were ob&s;ti|nately again&s;t; and that &s;o much, that tho' the Engli&s;h won the Battle&punc; yet they lo&s;t the Prize, for the young Q een was privately embarqu'd, carry'd away $word$ France, and there marry'd to the $word$</P>
<P>I &s;ay this Battle was &s;ought here $word$ we call it the Battle of Mu&s;clebro: And &s;ome Scots Gentlemen, who r$ $ $word$ with us afterwards to &s;hew us the Place, particularly mark'd out every Step to us where the Action was both begun a$d ended, as well the Fight as the $word$ and we agreed that the Scots are in the right, who call it the Battle of Pinkie not of Mu&s;clebro. 'Tis none of my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to give an Account of Battles and Sieges; be&s;ides, the Engli&s;h being Victors, I &s;hall not mingle any of our Trophies and Triumphs with my Account of Scot|land, that would not be u&s;ing the Scots fairly, I &s;hall &s;peak freely of tho&s;e where they were Victors, but not throw the Engli&s;h, as it were in their Faces; that would be to act the very Part which I blame the Scots Writers for, namely to be always crying up my own Country and my own People. Certain it is, the Scots great Error at this Battle, as it was afterwards at the Battle of Dunbar&punc; was want of Unanimity among them&s;elves&punc; for we mu&s;t always blu&s;h when we pre|tend to &s;ay the Scots ever wanted Courage in the Field, let the Cau&s;e, or the T$me or the Government be what, when, and how they will.</P>
<P>Another Mi&s;take of the Scots&punc; at th$s Fight, was that they ventur'd to engage &s;o near the Sea, as to be within Reach of the Cannon from the Engli&s;h Men of War, in the Road of Mu&s;clebro, who&punc; very much to their Damage, flank'd her Army, and kept firing on the let $word$ all the while of the Battle, till the Troops were &s;o mingled with one another, that they could not, from the Ship, $word$ their Enemies from their $word$ This was a great Di&s;advantage to their whole Army, and e&s;pecially di&s;couraged and di&s;order'd their Infantry, and was ow|ing to the Inadvertency of the general
<PB REF="459">
Officers, not want of Courage or Bravery in their Men; and it would have been the &s;ame to the Engli&s;h had the Ca&s;e been theirs.</P>
<P>I am now at the Gates of Edinburgh; but before I come to de&s;cribe the Parti|culars of that City, give me leave to take it in Per&s;pective, and &s;peak &s;omething of it's Situation, which will be very nece&s;|&s;ary with re&s;pect to &s;ome Di&s;advantage which the City lyes under on that Ac|count.</P>
<P>When you &s;tand at a &s;mall Di&s;tance, and take a View of it from the Ea&s;t, you have, really but a confus'd Idea of the City, becau&s;e the Situation being in length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; and the breadth but $ll proportion'd to its length, you view under the greate&s;t Di&s;advantage po&s;&s;ible; whereas if you turn a little to the right Hand towards Leith, and &s;o come towards the City, from the North you &s;ee a very hand&s;ome Pro&s;pect of the whole City, and from the South you have yet a bet|ter View of one Part, becau&s;e the City is encrea&s;ed on that Side with new Streets, which, on the North Side, cannot be.</P>
<P>The particular Situation then of the whole is thus. At the Extremity of the Ea&s;t End of the City &s;tands the Palace or Court, call'd Haly Rood Hou&s;e; and you mu&s;t fetch a little Sweep to the right Hand to leave the Palace on the left, and come at the Entrance, which is call'd the Water Port, and which you come at thro' a &s;hort Suburb: then bearing to the left again, South, you come to the Gate of the Palace which faces the great Street.</P>
<P>From the Palace, We&s;t, the Street goes on in almo&s;t a &s;traight Line, and for near $word$ Mile and a half in length, &s;ome &s;ay full two mea&s;ur'd Miles, thro' the whole City to the Ca&s;tle, including the going up the Ca&s;tle in the In&s;ide; this i$, perhaps, the $arge&s;t, longe&s;t, and fine&s;t Street for Build|ings and Number of Inhabitants, not in $ritain only, but in the World.</P>
<P>From the very Palace Door, which lands on a Flat, and level with the low|$&s;t of the plain Country, the Street be|gins to a&s;cend; and tho' it a&s;cends very gradually at fir&s;t, and is no where &s;teep, yet 'tis ea&s;y to under&s;tand that continuing the A&s;cent for &s;o long a Way, the further Part, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be very high; and &s;o it is; for the Ca&s;tle which &s;tands at the Extremity We&s;t, as the Palace do$s Ea&s;t, makes on all the three Sides, that only excepted, which joins it to the City, a frightful and impa&s;&s;able Precipice</P>
<P>Together with this continued A&s;cent, which, I think, 'tis ea&s;y to from an Idea of in the Mind, you are to &s;uppo&s;e the Edge or Top of the A&s;cent &s;o narrow, that the Street, and the Row of Hou&s;es on each S de of it, take up the whole breadth; &s;o that which Way &s;oever you turn, either to the Right or to the Left, you go down Hill immediately, and that &s;o &s;teep, as is very trouble&s;ome to tho&s;e who walk in tho&s;e Side Lanes which they call Wynds, e&s;pecially if their Lungs are not very good: So that, in a Word, the City &s;tands upon the narrow Ridge of a long a&s;cending Mountain.</P>
<P>On the Right Side, or North Side of the City, and from the very We&s;t End of it, where the Ca&s;tle &s;tands, is a Lough, or Lake of Standing Water; there is, indeed, a &s;mall Brook runs thro' i$, $o that it can|not be &s;aid to be quite Standing Water&punc; And we were told, that in former Days there was another Lough on the South Side of it, which, being now fill'd up, is built into a Street, tho' &s;o much lower than the High Street, or Ridge, that, as I &s;aid before, the Lanes or Wynds be|tween them are very &s;teep.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conclude that &s;uch a Situ|ation as this could never be pick'd out for a City or Town, upon any other Con&s;i|deration than that of Strength to defend them&s;elves from the &s;uddam Surprizes and A&s;&s;aults of Enemies: And, tho' the Building is &s;o antient, that no Hi&s;tory has recorded the Foundation, either when, or by who, or on what Occa&s;ion it was built&punc; yet, I &s;ay, it &s;eems mo&s;t natural to conclude, that it was built for a Retreat from the Outrages and Attempts of the
<PB REF="460">
Picts or Iri&s;h, or whatever other Enemies they had to fear.</P>
<P>On the Top of the Ridge of a Hill, an impregnable Ca&s;tle and Precipice at one End, a Lough, or Lake of Water on either Side; &s;o that the Inhabitants had nothing to defend but the Butrance at the Ea&s;t End, which it was to for|tify.</P>
<P>If this was not the Rea&s;on, what &s;hould have hindered them from building the City in a plea&s;ant, delightful Valley, with the Sea flowing up to one Side, and a Fre&s;h Water River running thro' the Middle of it; &s;uch as is all that Space of Ground between the City, as it now &s;tands, whereof the Town of Leith now &s;tands.</P>
<P>Here they had had a noble, a plea|&s;ant, and a mo&s;t u&s;eful Situation, a very fine Harbour for their Trade, a good Road in the Firth for their Ships of Burthen, a plea&s;ant River, which, with &s;mall Art or Charge, might have been &s;o drawn round the City as to have fill'd its Ditches, and made its Fortifications as impregna|ble as the two Loughs did the City, and as the French, when they fortify'd Leith, found ea&s;y to do. Or had they gone to the South Side of the City, be|yond the deep Lough, which, they &s;ay it was, and which is now call'd the Cow-Gate, and extended the City towards Li|berto$n, and towards Good Trees, where now &s;tands the delightful Seat of Sir James Stuart, late Lord Advocate of Scotland, and the ancient Seat of Craig|miller, the Seat of Sir Alexander&mdash;of Craigmiller. Here had been a Plain large enough to have contain'd a &s;econd London, and water'd on the South Part with a plea&s;ant Brook, &s;ufficient, by the Help of Pipes, to have carried Water in|to every Street, and every Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things they did not fore&s;ee, or under&s;tand in tho&s;e Days; but, regard|ing immediate Safety, fixed on the Place as above as a &s;ure Strength, form'd by Nature, and ready at their Hand. By this Means the City &s;uffers infinite Di&s;|advantages, and lies under &s;uch &s;canda+lous Inconveniencies as are, by its $word$ made a Subject of Scorn and Re|proach; as if the People were not a willing to live &s;weet and clean as othe$ Nations, but delighted in Stench an$ Na&s;tine&s;s; whereas, were any other Peo|ple to live under the &s;ame Unhappine&s;s&punc; I mean as well of a rocky and m$ua|tainous Situation, throng'd Buildings, from &s;even to ten or twelve Story high, a &s;carcity of Water, and that little they have difficult to be had, and to the up|permo&s;t Lodgings, far to fetch; we &s;hould find a London or a Bri&s;tol as dirty as Edinburgh, and, perhaps, le&s;s able to make their Dwelling tolerable, at lea&s;t in &s;o narrow a Compa&s;s; for, tho' many Ci|ties have more People in them. Yet, I believe, this may be &s;aid with Truth, that in no City in the World &s;o many Peo|ple live in &s;o little Room as at Edin|burgh.</P>
<P>On the North Side of the City, as is &s;aid above, is a &s;pacious, rich, and plea|&s;ant Plain, extending from the Lough, which as above joins the City, to the River of Leith, at the Mouth of which is the Town of Leith, at the Di&s;tance of a long Scots Mile from the City: And even here, were not the North Side of the Hill, which the City &s;tands on&punc; $o exceeding &s;teep, as hardly, (at lea&s;t to the We&s;tward of their Fle&s;h-Market) to be clambered up on Foot, much le&s;s to be made pa&s;&s;able for Carriages. But, I &s;ay, were it not &s;o &s;leep, and were the Lough filled up, as it might ea&s;$$y be, the City might have been extended up|on the Plain below, and fine beautiful Streets would, no doubt, have been built there; nay, I que&s;tion much whether, in Time, the high Streets would not have been for&s;aken, and the City, as we might &s;ay, run all out of its Gates to the North.</P>
<P>This might have been expected, if the City had been in a State of Encrea&s;e, f$r the Trade having flouri&s;hed, as was rea|&s;onably expected upon the Union, the
<PB REF="461">
$nhabitants had likewi&s;e encreas'd; where|$s, there being Rea&s;on to doubt that this $s not the Ca&s;e, but rather the contrary, we cannot talk of this as a Pro&s;pect in Hope.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the City in its Appearance, and in its pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion, I mu&s;t look next into its In&s;ide, where we &s;hall find it under all its Di&s;|couragements and Di&s;advantages, (and $abouring with whatever Inconveniencies) a large, populous, noble, rich, and even &s;till a Royal City, The main &s;treet, as above, is the mo&s;t &s;pacious, the longe&s;t, and be&s;t inhabited &s;treet in Europe; its Length I have de&s;crib'd; the Buildings all &s;urprizing both for Strength&punc; for Beau|ty, and for Height; all, or the greate&s;t Part of Free &s;tone, and $o firm is every Thing made, that tho' in &s;o high a &s;itua|tion&punc; and in a Country where Storms and Winds are &s;o frequent, 'tis very rare that any Damage is done here. No blow|ing of Tiles about the Streets, to knock People on the Head as they pa&s;s; no Stacks of Chimneys and Gable Ends of Hou&s;es falling in to bury the inhabitants in their Ruins, as we often find it in London, and other of our Paper built Cities in England; but all is fixed, and &s;trong to the Top, tho' you have, in that Part of the City called the Parlia|ment Clo&s;e, Hou&s;es, which, on the South &s;ide, appear to be eleven or twelve Story high, and inhabited to the very Top,</P>
<P>From the Palace Gate, We&s;tward, this &s;treet is called the Cannon-gate, vulgarly the Cannigate, which Part, tho' a Suburb, is a kind of Corporation by it&s;elf, as We&s;t|min&s;ter to London; and has a Toll Booth, a Pri&s;on, and a Town&punc;Guard by it&s;elf, tho' under the Government of the Provo&s;t and Baili$$s of Edinburgh, as Leith it&s;elf al&s;o is. In this Part of the &s;treet, tho' otherwi&s;e not &s;o well inhabited as the City it&s;elf, are &s;everal very magnificent Hou&s;es of the Nobility, built for their Re&s;idence when the Court was in Town, and on their other Occa&s;ions, ju&s;t as was the Ca&s;e in the Strand between London and White Hall, before the Encrea&s;e of the City prompted the building tho&s;e fine Hou&s;es into Streets.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e the Duke of Queensberry's, the Earl of Wintoun's, the Duke of Rox|burgh's, and the Earl of Murray's are the Chief; the fir&s;t and la&s;t are very magnificent, large and princely Buildings, all of Free &s;tone, large in Front, and with good Gardens behind them, and the other are very fine Buildings, too many to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>At the upper, or We&s;t End of this &s;treet, and where it joins to the City, is a Gate which, ju&s;t as Ludgate, or Temple-Bar, &s;tands parting the City it&s;elf from the Suburb, but not all di&s;continuing the &s;treet, which rather widens, and is more &s;pa|cious when you are thro' the Gate than before. This Gate, or Bow, is called the Nether Bow, or, by &s;ome, the Nether-Bow Port.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this Port, on the Out&s;ide, turn away two &s;treets, one goes &s;outh to a Gate or Port which lead out of the City into the great Road for England, by the Way of Kel&s;o, and is called St Mary Wynde; and, on the Right Hard of it, another Port turns away We&s;t, int the low &s;treet, mentioned before, where was a Lough formerly filled up, and is called the Cow-Gate, becau&s;e, by this &s;treet, the Cattle are driven to and from the great Market-place, called the Gra&s;s Mar|ket, where &s;uch Cattle are bought and &s;old, as al&s;o where is a Hor&s;e Market weekly, as in Smithfield. This Street, called the Cow&punc;Gate, runs parallel with high &s;treet, but down in a Bottom, as has been &s;aid. But to go back to the Nether Bow Port, as this Turning is on the Lef$ Hand going into the C$$y, &s;o on the Right Hand goes another &s;treet, which they call Leith Wind, and leads down to a Gate which is not in the City Wall immediately, but adjoining to a Church called the College-Kirk, and thro' which Gate, a Suburb runs North opening into the Plain, leads to Leith; and along by the Road &s;ide, the Road pav'd with &s;tones like a &s;treet, is a broad Cau&s;eway, or as we call it, a Foot Way, very firm, and made by
<PB REF="462">
Hand at lea&s;t 20 Foot broad, and con|tinued to the Town of Leith. This Cau&s;e|way is very well kept at the publick Ex|pence, and no Hor&s;es &s;uffered to come upon it.</P>
<P>At the turning down of this Street, without the Nether-Bow Port, which they call the Head of the Canon-gate, there &s;tood a very great Pile of Building which went both Ways, Part made the Ea&s;t Side of the Turning called Leith Wynd, and Part made the North Side of the Can|non-gate; the whole was built, as many &s;uch are, for private Dwellings, but were &s;tately&punc; high, and very hand&s;ome Build|ings&punc; &s;even or eight Stories: But great Part of this fine Pile of Building was very unhappily burnt a few Years ago, whe|ther they are yet fully rebuilt, I cannot &s;ay.</P>
<P>We now enter the City, properly &s;o cal|led; in almo&s;t the fir&s;t Buildings of Note on the North Side of the Street, the Mar|que&s;s of Tweedale has a good City Hou&s;e, with a Plantation of Lime-trees behind it, in&s;tead of a Garden, the Place not allow|ing Room for a large Garden; adjoining to which are very good Buildings, tho' in the narrow Wynds and Alleys, &s;uch as if &s;et out in hand&s;ome Streets, would have adorn d a very noble City, but are here crouded together, as may be &s;aid, without Notice</P>
<P>Here the Phy&s;icians have a Hall, and adjoining to it a very good Garden; but I &s;aw no Simples in it of Value, there be|ing a Phy&s;ick Garden at the Palace which furni&s;hes them &s;ufficiently; But they have a fine Mu&s;aeum, or Chamber of Rarities, which are worth &s;eeing, and which, in &s;ome Things, is not to be match'd in Europe. Dr. Belford, afterwards knight|ed, Began the Coll$ction. Sir Sobert S b|bald has printed a Catalogue of what was then depo&s;ited in his Time. The Phy&s;i|cians of Edinburgh have pre&s;erved the Character of Able, Learned, and Experi|enced, and have not been outdone by any of their Neighbours: And the late Dr. Pitcairn, who was the Ratcliff ef Scot|land, has left large Te&s;timonies of his Skill in Nature and Medicine to the World.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be expected I can go on to de&s;cribe all the Buildings of the City: I &s;hall therefore only touch at &s;uch Things, and go on. From the Neither Bow, you have an open view up the high Street. On the South Side is the I $o$e Kirk, and a little farther, in the middle of the Street the Guard Hou&s;e, where the Town Guard does Duty every Night. The&s;e are in the Stead of our Watchmen, and the Town maintains two full Com|panies of them, clothed and armed as Grenadiers,</P>
<P>Tho&s;e are as a Guard to keep the pub|lick Peace of the City, but I cannot but acknowledge that they are not near &s;o good a Safe guard to the Citizens, again&s;t private Robberies, as our Watchmen in London are; and Edinburgh is not with|out &s;uch Fellows as Shop&punc;Lifters, Hou&s;e|robbers, and Pick pockets, in Proportion to the Number of People, as much as London it&s;elf.</P>
<P>About Midway, between the Nether Bow and the Ca&s;tle Hill, is the great Church, formerly it was call'd the Cathe|dral, and was all one Church, dedicated to St. Giles: But &s;ince the aboli&s;hing Epi&s;|copacy, and that the Presbyterian Church is now e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Union, &s;o as never legally to &s;uffer another Change; I &s;ay never legally, becau&s;e it cannot be done without di&s;&s;olving the Union, which I take to be indi&s;&s;olvable: Since this E&s;ta|bli&s;hment, the Cathedral Church is div d|ed into four Parochial Churches.</P>
<P>In one of tho&s;e Churches, which they call the New Church, were Seats for the Parliament, High Commi&s;&s;ioners, and the Nobility, when the Parliament was a&s;|&s;embled, tho' that Occa&s;ion is now over; In a Room, formerly a Kind of con&s;i&s;tory Room, on the South Side of the Church, the General A&s;&s;embly hold their Meet|ings once a Year, as al&s;o does the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly in the Intervals of the General Meeting as Occa&s;ion re|quires. In the great Tower of this Church they have a Set of Bells, which are not
<PB REF="463">
$g out as in England, for that Way of $nging is not known here; but they are $yed upon with Keys, and by a Man's $nd, like a Harp&s;icord; the Per&s;on play|g has great &s;trong wooden Ca&s;es to his $gers, by which he is able to &s;trike with $word$ more Force, and he plays &s;everal $nes very mu&s;ically, tho' they are heard uch better at a Di&s;tance than near at $$d; the Man plays every Day, Sun|$y and Fa&s;t Days excepted, at twelve a ock, and has a yearly Salary for doing and very well he ea ns the Money.</P>
<P>On the South Side of this Church is a uare of very fine Buildings, which is $$led by the Name of the Parliament $ole; the We&s;t Side of the Square, and $rt of the South, is taken up with the $rliament Hou&s;e, and the &s;everal Courts $word$ Ju&s;tice, the Council Chamber, the $ea&s;ury, the publick Offices, Regi&s;ters, $e publick Library, &amp;c the Court for $e meeting of the Royal Buroughs, and $eral Offices needful, when the Inde|$ndency of Scotland was in being, but $w not &s;o much in U&s;e. But as the Se&s;&s;ion, $word$ College of Ju&s;tice, the Exchequer, and $word$ Ju&s;ticiary, or Courts for criminal Cau&s;es $ll exi&s;t, the u&s;ual Places for their a&s;&s;em|$ing are &s;till pre&s;erved. The&s;e Bu ldings $e very fine, all of Free &s;tone, well fini|$d, and very magnifi ent. The great $hurch makes up the North Side of the $uare, and the Ea&s;t remaining Part of the $uth Side is built into private Dwellings $ry &s;tately, lofty, and &s;trong, being $ven Story high to the Front of the $quare, and the Hill they &s;tand on giving $word$ &s;udden a De&s;cent, they are eleven or $elve Story high backward</P>
<P>The publick Part was fir&s;t fini&s;hed by $word$ Charles I. and an eque&s;trian Statute $word$ King Charle II&punc; &s;tands in the middle $word$ the Square; all the Ea&s;t Part was $rnt down by a mo&s;t terrible Fire, in $e Year&mdash;or thereabout; but &s;ince $b$$lt as fine as ever.</P>
<P>The great Opening into the high Street $ing the only Pa&s;&s;age into it for Coaches, at the North Ea&s;t Corner, between the South Ea&s;t Corner of the High Kirk, and the oppo&s;ite high Buildings, and a little from the Opening is the Market-Oro&s;s, where all their Proclamations and publick Acts are read and publi&s;h'd by &s;ound of Trumper. Here is the great Parade, where, every Day, the Gentlemen meet for Bu&s;i|ne&s;s or News, as at an Exchange, the u&s;ual Time of Meeting is from Fleven to One. Here is al&s;o another Pa&s;&s;age at the North We&s;t Corner, which goes into the Land market, and another Pa&s;&s;age down innumerable Stone Stairs, on the South S$de, leading into the Cowgate.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t End of the great Church, but in a different Building, is the Tol|booth, or common Pri&s;on, as well for Criminals as Debtors, and a mi&s;erable Hole it is, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it; tho', for tho&s;e that can pay for it, there are &s;ome Apartments tolerable enoguh, and Per&s;ons of Quality are &s;ometimes confin'd here.</P>
<P>The great Church and this Pri&s;on al&s;o &s;tanding in the middle of the Street, the Breadth and Beauty of it is for &s;ome Time interrupted, and the Way is contracted for &s;o far as tho&s;e Buildings reach on the North Side.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e Buildings pa&s;t, the S reet opens again to a Breadth rather wider than before, and this is called the Land market, but for what Rea&s;on I know not. This Part is al&s;o nobly built, and extends We&s;t to the Ca&s;tle Hill, or rather to a narrower Street which leads up to the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>At the upper End of this Land market is a Stone Building&punc; appropriated to &s;e|veral publick Offices of le&s;&s;er Value, and is called the Weigh-hou&s;e; for below Stairs are Warehou&s;es, with publick Weights and Scales for heavy Goods.</P>
<P>He e the high Str$e$ ends, and porting into two Streets, one goes away South We&s;t, and de&s;cending gradually, leads by the We&s;t Bow, as 'tis called, to the Gra&s;s-market. This Street, which is called the Bow, is generally full of whole&s;ale Tra|ders, and tho&s;e very con&s;iderable Dealers in I$on, Pitch. Tar, Oyl, Hemp, Flax, Lin&s;eed, Painters Colours, Dyers, Drugs
<PB REF="464">
and Woods, and &s;uch like heavy Goods, and &s;upplies Country Shopkeepers, as our Whole&s;ale Dealers in England do: And here I may &s;ay, is a vi&s;ible Face of Trade, mo&s;t of them have al&s;o Ware|hou&s;es in Leith, where they lay up the heavier Goods, and bring them hither, or &s;ell them by Patterns and Samples, as they have Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There are large Gates in the City which they call Ports, including tho&s;e to the Cannon Gate.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Water-Gate, which is the Ea&s;t Gate by the Palace, leading out of the City towards Berwick, and is the great Po&s;t Road to England.</P>
<P N="2">2. The South Port, mentioned before, leading likewi&s;e into the Road to Soutra Hill, and &s;o to England by way of Kel&s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Cowgate Port, at the Ea&s;t End of the Cowgate, and entring from the &s;treet leading to the &s;outh Port.</P>
<P N="4">4. The College Port, or the Gate go|ing South by the Wall of Harriot's Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P N="5">5. The We&s;t Bow Port, &s;poken of be|fore in the middle of the &s;treet, men|tiened above where the whole&s;ale Dealers dwell.</P>
<P N="6">6. The North Port, a Gate leading from the Butchery, or Fle&s;h market, over the End of the Lough.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Nether-Bow Port, &s;poken of at large, leading into the City from the Cannon Gate.</P>
<P N="8">8. The College-Ki$k Port, at the Bot|tom or Foot of Leith Wynd.</P>
<P N="9">9. The We&s;t Port, which is the only Gate in the We&s;t End of the City, and leads out to all the We&s;t and North Parts of Scotland, and e&s;pe|cially to Gla&s;gow, to Sterling, and to the Queens Ferry, the two la&s;t being the principal Pa&s;&s;ages into the North.</P>
<P>The Markets in Edinburgh are not in the open Street, except that in the high &s;treet, where there is every $span$ an Herb and Fruit Market&punc; $span$ abates before Noon, and what $span$ then is no Grievance, Be&s;ides $span$ are &s;everal di$$inct Market $span$ in, and re&s;erved for the particular $span$ they are appointed for, and very $span$ regulated by the Magi&s;trates, and well rep|plied al&s;o, as</P>
<P N="1">1. The Meal&punc;Market.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Fle&s;h Market.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Pou$try Market.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Butter-Market.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Gra&s;s-Market.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Hor&s;e-Market.</P>
<P>Kept open, and in the &s;ame Street ju&s;t within thewe&s;t Port with &s;everal others. There is al&s;o, in the &s;treet called the Land Market, a week|ly Market for all &s;orts of Woollen Ma|nufactures, and &s;ome Mercery and Dra|pery Goods, and al&s;o for Linnen Cloth.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not omit the Seminaries of Learning, and the Attendants upon them, nor the Surgeons and Apotheca|ries, with the great Ho&s;pital, all which &s;tand on the &s;outh &s;ide of the City; the fir&s;t of them is the Surgeons Hall, or Surgeon-Apothecaries, for here they make but one Profe&s;&s;ion. They have &s;et up a large Building all at their own Charge, in which is their great Hall, hung round with the Pictures of all the Sur|geons of the City, that are, or have been &s;ince the Building was erected, as $word$ the Pictures of Duke Hamilton, and the late Lord Chancellor</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a Chamber of Rarities, a Theatre for Di&s;&s;ections, and the $word$ Bagnio in Britain; 'tis perfectly well con|trived, and exactly well fini&s;hed, no Ex|pence being &s;pared to make it both con|venient and effectually u&s;eful.</P>
<P>In their Chamber of Rarities they have &s;everal Skeletons of &s;trange Creatures, a$ Mummy, and other curious Things, too many to be particular in them here.</P>
<P>The Humanity School is kept in the &s;ame Part, which is reckoned as a Par$
<PB REF="465">
of the Univer&s;ity, as being employ'd in the $word$ Youth for the College. We&s;t of the&s;e is the College it&s;elf, they call it the Univer&s;ity: But as it con&s;i&s;ts of but one College, I call it no more. How|ever, here are all the u&s;ual Methods of Academick Learning in their full Perfecti|on. The Principal, or Ma&s;ter, has a hand|&s;ome D elling-hou&s;e and Garden in the College. There are be&s;ides a Profe&s;&s;or of $word$ four Regents, or Profe&s;&s;ors of $word$ a Profe&s;&s;or of Greek, $span$ Hebrew&punc; another of Hi&s;tory, of the Mathematicks, and of the Civil $aw</P>
<P>The College has a very hand&s;ome Pub+l$k Library; and, though not famous for Number of Books, is yet &s;o for its being a valuable Collection of Antiquity, and has $ome very good Manu&s;cripts. The $word$ Act of Parliament for &s;ettling the Right of Copies, has made Provi&s;ion for a con&s;tant Supply of modern Books, $word$ &s;uch as are printed in England; $word$ the Library is like to Encrea&s;e, in $word$ to a great one.</P>
<P>Here was formerly a Mint, but that is $ow laid a&s;ide, the Union having made $ne and the &s;ame Coinage common to $e whole I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Churches in this populous City are $t Ten, (viz.)</P>
<P N="1">1. The Cannon Gate Church.</P>
<P N="2">2. The College Kirk.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Trone Kirk.</P>
<P N="4">4. The New Kirk.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Old Kirk.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Tolbooth Kirk.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Haddocks Hole Kirk.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Lady Ye&s;ter's Kirk.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Gray Friars Kirk.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Well Kirk</P>
<P>There are al&s;o many Meeting-hou&s;es he $span$ who call $word$ Church of England&punc; though they $ot all u&s;e the $ngli&s;h $ommon Prayer&punc; The&s;e are the Di&s;&s;enters in Scotland, as the Presbyterians are Di&s;&s;enters in Eng|land.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o two Churches at Leith, and very large and very full they are, and &s;o indeed are all the Churches in the City, for the People of Scotland do not wander about on the Sabbath Days, as in England; and even tho&s;e who may have no more Religion than enough, yet Cu&s;tom in &s;hort has made i$ almo&s;t natural to them, they all go to the Kirk.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o one very good Cu|&s;tom as to their Behaviour in the Church, which I wi&s;h were practis'd here, namely, that after the Sermon is over, and the Ble&s;&s;ings given, they all look round up|on their Friends, and e&s;pecially to Per|&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, and make their Civi|lities and Bows as we do here, for, by the Way, the Scots do not want Man|ners.</P>
<P>I have now done with the City, the Palace only, and the Ca&s;tle remain to be be mention'd; the la&s;t is &s;trong by Situa|tion, not much better'd by Art, and far from being impregnable, as has been proved more than once. It is now of little U&s;e, unle&s;s for Salutes, and firing Guns upon Fe&s;tivals, and in &s;ome Ca|&s;es to lay up Magazine of Arms and Ammunition, and to receive Pri&s;oners of State.</P>
<P>The Governor has very good Apart|ments, and &s;o has the Lieutenant Go|vernor, as al&s;o the Fort-Major, and &s;ome other Officers, and there are deep Vaults in the Rock, which they &s;ay are Boom-Proof, and I doubt not but they are &s;o, for they go down into them by a great Number of Steps. There is al|&s;o a Well of very good Water in the
<PB REF="466">
Ca&s;tle, and it is carefully kept, but it is prodigious Depth. Here are not a great $word$ Guns planted, neither, indeed, is here Room to place many Guns, or U&s;e for them where they can be plac'd the Works &s;o very high.</P>
<P>The Palace is a hand&s;ome Building, ra|ther convenienc than large. The Entrance is Maje&s;tick, and over the Gate a large Apartment, which the Duke of Hamilton claims as Hou&s;e-keeper, or rather Gate|keeper of the Palace; within this a large, irregular Court, where, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, are very improperly plac'd the Coach|hou&s;es and Stables, which &s;hould much ra|ther have been farther off, either in the Park&punc; or without the Outgate; And, if here had been a Barrack, or Guard-hou&s;e, like the Hor&s;e-Guards at Whitehall, it would have look'd much more like a Royal Palace for the King. On either Side of this Court are Gardens, Yards the Scots call them, whereof one is like our Apothecaries Garden at Chel&s;ea, call'd a Phy&s;ick Garden, and is tolerably well &s;tor'd with Simples, and &s;ome Exoticks of Value; and, particularly I was told, there was a Rhubarb Tree, or Plant, and which throve very well. In this Garden &s;tands Queen Mary's Dial, which is a very cu|rious one, but neglected.</P>
<P>Antiquity claim the Fee Simple here, and tell us that the Church is &s;till Ground Landlord; for, before the Reformation, this was a Mona&s;tery; and, tho' it was converted into a Palace before the Sup|pre&s;&s;ion of Religious Hou&s;es, yet, that till then the Monks had a fair Apartment, and was therefore call'd Haly-rood Hou&s;e, and they did but entertain the Kings and Queens in the other as a Kind of Gue&s;t Mares, or, as we call them, Lodgers.</P>
<P>But, be that as it will, the Reforma|tion found a good Hou&s;e upon the Pre|mi&s;&s;es, which &s;erv'd the Kings for &s;ome ages before, and which King Charles II. after the Re&s;toration, caus'd to be pul|led down, except the two Rondels, or Towers, and built the whole Fabrick new as it now &s;tands. It is a firm, &s;trong Building, &s;quare in Form, having one Court only in the Center; and the lower Story being divided, the inner Part makes a very hand&s;ome Piazza, tho' the Work is plain, and very little Ornament, there|fore not to be de&s;cribed as one Author does by the Pillars of the Exchange of London, which are &s;et off with almo&s;t all the Ornament Art could invent.</P>
<P>The Apartments are all upon the fir&s;t Floor, the Offices below, and &s;ome upper Rooms are allotted to the Servants of the Court when the Court is there. I have not Room to de&s;cribe the particular Apartments, nor is it of Moment. The great Stair-ca&s;e is at the South We&s;t Cor|ner of the Hou&s;e, and the Guard-Cham|ber and Rooms of State take up the South Side of the Hou&s;e, as the King's Lodg|ings do the Ea&s;t Side, which the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner makes u&s;e of in Time of Parliament; and the We&s;t Side would be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Queen's Lodgings, if &s;uch a Thing was to be &s;een again in Scotland, but at pre&s;ent are out o$ U&s;e. The North Side is taken up wi$h one large Gallery, reaching the whole length of the Hou&s;e, famous for having the Pic|tures of all the Kings of Scotland, from King Fergus, who, they &s;ay, reigned Anno ant. CHR. 320. But, in my Opi|nion, as the&s;e Pictures cannot be, and are not &s;uppo&s;ed to the Originals, but ju&s;t a Face and Dre&s;s left to the Di&s;cretion of the Limner, and &s;o are all Guels-work, I &s;ee no Rarity, or, indeed, any Thing valuable in it. As to their later Kings there may be &s;ome Pretence to have their Pictures from old pre&s;erved Draughts, or from their Coins or Medals, and &s;uch may be, indeed, worth pre&s;erving; and, tho' they were but copyed again, it would have been worth &s;eeing; but, as it is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s it &s;eems a trifling Thing, ra|ther than a Gallery $it for a Court.</P>
<P>The old Chapel Royal, or Church o$ the Convent, &s;tands in its Di$shabile, $$|ined and decayed, and mu&s;t fall down. $a King James IId's Time, the old Council-Chamber was con&s;ecrated for a Chapel,

<P>I mu&s;t now vi&s;it Leith, the Sea Port Edinburgh, as it is properly called: It large and populous Town, or rather $word$ Towns, for the River or Harbour $word$ them, and they are joined by a good $word$ Bridge, about half a Mile, or more, Mouth of the River.</P>
<P>Up to this Bridge Ships of Burthen may $word$ and, at High Water, lay their Sides $word$ to the Shore; but at low Water $ple pa&s;s over on Foot, even without $word$ P$er; but the Water &s;lows in the Firth $word$ three Fathom right up and down.</P>
<P>Here is a very fine Key well wharf'd with Stone, and fenced with Piles, $word$ to di&s;charge much more Bu&s;ine&s;s than Place can &s;upply, tho' the Trade is from being incon&s;iderable too. At Mouth of the Harbour is a very long well built Pier, or Head, which runs beyond the Land a great Way, and $word$ defends the Entrance into the $word$ from filling up with Saud, as, upon $word$ Gales of Wind at North Ea&s;t, would $ery likely: There are al&s;o Ranges of $word$ or Break waters, as the Seamen call $word$ on the other Side the Harbour, all $word$ are kept in good Repair; and by Means the Harbour is pre&s;erved, and $word$ open in &s;pight of a Flat Shore, and $word$ &s;well of the Sea.</P>
<P>$word$ the other Side the Bride is the $word$ of a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, built by Oliver $well to command the Port, but de|&s;hed; yet not &s;o much, but that a little Expence and a few Hands would &s;oon re&s;tore it. Here the late Rebel H$gh|landers made a bold Stop, and took Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for one Night; but not find|ing their Friends in the City in any Con|dition to join them; and the Troops pre|paring to attack them, they quitted it in the Night, and marched off to the Ear$ of Winton's Hou&s;e, as has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>Leith, tho' it has a particular Bayli$$, is yet under the Juri&s;d$ction of the Magi&s;|trates of Edinburgh, and is governed by them The Town had a great Di&s;a&s;ter a few Years before the Union, by a Store|hou&s;e of Gunpowdertaking Fire, which de|moli&s;hed almo&s;t a whole Street of Hou&s;es, the Lo&s;s is not fully repaired to this Day: Many Lives al&s;o were lo&s;t, and many People mi&s;erably hurt and brui&s;ed, which, I think, &s;hould &s;erve as a hint to all Governments, not to &s;uffer Quantities of Powder to be kept in populous Towns.</P>
<P>This Town was once very &s;trong, when the French held it, as they did for many Years again&s;t the Reformers, and were not at la&s;t driven out but by an Army from England, which Queen Eliza|beth &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Prote&s;tants</P>

<P>There is al&s;o a Ferry at Leith, the Boats going from Leith to Burnt-I&s;land, or, as the Scots call it, Brantillian; but as 'tis no le&s;s than &s;even Miles, and that &s;ome|times they meet with bad Weather: The Pa&s;&s;engers are &s;o often f$i$hted, that I knew &s;everal Gentlemen that would al|ways choo&s;e to go round to the Queens Ferry, rather than venture over at Leith; this, I &s;uppo&s;e, gave Beginning to that homely Piece of Proverb Poetry, that,

Queens Ferry is not a Pa&s;&s;age over the Water only, but a very good Town al&s;o, and a Corporation. And here I mu&s;t take Notice of a Thing which was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, I mean as to the Quantity of Herrings taken, and that might be taken in tho&s;e Seas. There was, at that Time, a Fleet of between &s;even and eight Hundred Sail of Dutch Bu&s;&s;es come into the Firth, loaden with Herrings, and their Convoy with them, for it was in the Tim$ of the late Wars; the Scots them&s;elves had taken a va&s;t Quantity, for they &s;aid they had had a very good Fi&s;hery along upon the Coa&s;t of Fife, and of Aberdeen, and the Dunbar Men, and the Firth Boats, were every Day taking more; and yet the Water of the Firth was &s;o full of Fi&s;h, that pa&s;&s;ing at the Queens Ferry in a little Norway Yawl, or Boat, rowed by two Boys, the Boys to&s;s'd the Fi&s;h out of the Water into the Boat with their naked Hands only: But I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to men|tion this again.</P>
<P>Between Edinburgh and this Town the Marque&s;s of Annandale has a &s;mall, but very plea&s;ant Hou&s;e. And here I ob|&s;erved his Lord&s;hip was making Bricks, in order to build Walls round his Gar|den; a Thing hard to be &s;een in Scot|land, except there. On the other Hand, it is for want of Brick Walls that the Wall Fruit in Scotland does not thrive &s;o well there as it would otherwi&s;e do: And whereas they have no Peaches or Nectarines, or but very few, it is evi|dent, had they Brick Walls they might have both; but the Stone will not do it. The Reflection of the Sun is not equally nouri&s;hing, nor does the Stone hold the Warmth of the Sun, after it is gone, as the Bricks do.</P>
<P>All the Country, between Edinburgh and this Place, is throng'd with Gentle|men's Hou&s;es, al&s;o as it was ob&s;erved to be on the other Side: But the Beauty of all this Part is Hopton Hou&s;e, built upon a delightful Plain, and yet upon the Edge, as we may &s;ay, of a high Preci|pice; from whence you, as it were&punc; $ $word$ down upon the Ships as they Sail by for you &s;tand above the Top Ma&s;t He$d$ of them.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e was originally a squa$e but the Earl is now adding two Wings to it, which will greatly add to the B$au y of the Building; the Situation is &s;o $word$ and gives &s;o fine a Pro&s;pect, as $word$ t$ the Sea as to the Land, that $word$ can be finer.

But it w ul$ be endle&s;s to dwell upon the De&s;cript$$ of Gentlemen's Seats, in a Country whe$$ they are &s;o numerous, and where, indeed they are the chief Thing of Value th$ is to be &s;een.</P>

<P>On the South Shore, upon a narrow Slip or Point of Land, running far $word$ the Water&punc; lies Blackne&s;, Ca&s;tle, in $word$ Times infamous for the $word$ con|fining State-Pri&s;oners, and e&s;pecially $word$ as were taken up for religious $word$ $word$ where many peri&s;hed, either by the Unhealthine&s;s of the Place, or wa$t $word$ Conveniencies, or &s;omething, wor&s;e $word$ might be of U&s;e, if the Har$ our, as I have &s;aid, was frequented; but as $t is there &s;eems to be no Occa&s;ion at all for it.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY XII.</HEAD>
<P>AS I entered the Ea&s;t Side of Scot|land from Berwick upon Tweed, and have carryed on my Ac|counts through the Louthians, which are de&s;ervedly called the be&s;t and mo&s;t plea&s;ant, as well as mo&s;t fruitful Part of Scotland: And therein have al|&s;o given you my Ob&s;ervations of the Capital City and Port of the Kingdom, I mean Edinburgh and Leith: So the We&s;t Part having been travelled over by me at another particular Journey from England; and that I went from England by another Road, I &s;hall give you my Account of it al&s;o by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the River Eden, or, (as it is ordinarily called) the Solway Firth at Carli&s;le, we entered upon Scotland, on the Side of Dumfries Shire, the South|mo&s;t Shire of the We&s;t of Scotland. The Divi&s;ion of this County into E&s;k|dale, Nith$dale, and Ann$ndale, is but the ordinary marking out the Rivers E&s;k, Annan, and Nid&punc; as I ob&s;erved of the Rivers in the North of England, Tweedale, Tyndale, Swale Dal$, and others; for the whole Province makes but one Dumfries Shire, and as &s;uch you will under&s;tand it as I go on.</P>
<P>Tho E&s;k is a tolerable large River, and gives Name to the South Ea&s;t Part of this County; but we &s;aw little worth Notice but K$r$op, a &s;mall Market Town on a River of the &s;ame Name, which afterwards falls into E&s;k, and is famous for being the Place where, by a Treaty, after the Battle of Pinkey, the Limits or Borders of the two Kingdoms were &s;et|tled;
<PB REF="470">
though the Borderers ob&s;erved it, no longer than &s;erved for their Purpo&s;e, robbing and plundering one another upon all Occa&s;ions, as Opportunity offered.</P>
<P>This River &s;oon after leaves Scotland, and runs into the Engli&s;h Border, leav|ing nothing behind it worth my Trouble of Remarking, or yours of Reading, only to tell you it empties it&s;elf into the Solway Firth, which indeed receives all the Rivers on this Part of the I&s;land, as well from England as from Scotland.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Place of Note we came to in Scotland was Annand, or as &s;ome call it, Annandale, as they do the County, though, I think, improperly. It was a Town of Note, and a Sea Port, and ha|ving a good River and Harbour, was e&s;teemed a Town of good Trade; but it was not &s;ituated for Strength; and the Engli&s;h took it &s;o often, and e&s;pecially the la&s;t Time burnt it to the Ground, in that War &s;o fatal to the Scots, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. that it never recover'd. Here was a good Salmon Fi&s;hery, and a Trade to the I&s;le of Man, and by that to Ireland: But as the Face of Trade is altered &s;ince that Time, and by the Ruin of the Places the Merchants, and Men of Sub&s;tance, removed to Dumfries, the Town continues, to all Appearance, in a &s;tate of itrevocable Decay.</P>
<P>It was but a dull Welcome into Scot|land to &s;ee, not only by this Town, that the Remains of the old Deva&s;tations, com|mitted in the Time of the Ho&s;tilities be|tween the two Nations, were &s;o vi&s;ible, &s;o unrepair'd, and, as we might &s;ay, &s;o likely to continue unrepair'd; whereas, tho' there are Remains al&s;o on the Eng|li&s;h Side, yet, not &s;o plain, and in many Places Things much re&s;tor'd, and in a Way to be more &s;o: But the Poverty of the common People, and the Indolence of the Gentry, will fully account for the Difference. The Bridge over the River at Annand, is very firm and good, and there is a tolerable good Market.</P>
<P>From hence, keeping the Sea as clo&s;e as we could on our Left, we went on due We&s;t to Dumfries, a Sea-Port Town at the Mouth at the River Nid, or Nith, which gives Name to the third Divi&s;ion of the County call'd Nith&s;dale; but the Town is ju&s;tly the Capital of the whole Shire, and indeed, of all the South We&s;t Part of Scotland.</P>
<P>Here, indeed, as in &s;ome other Ports on this Side the I&s;land, the Benefits of Commerce, obtain'd to Scotland by the Union, appear vi&s;ible; and that much more than on the Ea&s;t Side, where they &s;eem to be little, if any thing mended, I mean in their Trade.</P>
<P>Dumfries was always a good Town, and full of Merchants. By Merchants, here I mean, in the Sen&s;e that Word is taken and under&s;tood in England (viz.) not Mercers and Drapers, Shop keepers, &amp;c. But Merchant Adventurers, who trade to foreign Parts, and employ a con|&s;iderable Number of Ships. But if this was &s;o before, it is much more &s;o now; and as they have (with Succe&s;s) embark|ed in Trade, as well to England as to the Engli&s;h Plantations, they apparently en|crea&s;e both in Shipping and People; for as it almo&s;t every where appears, where Trade increa&s;es, People mu&s;t and will in|crea&s;e; that is, they flock to the Place by the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of the Trade, and, in Return, where the Peo|ple increa&s;e, the Trade will increa&s;e, be|cau&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;umption of Pro|vi&s;ions, Cloats, Furniture, &amp;c. nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;es, and with them the Trade.</P>
<P>This is &s;uch a Chain of Trading Con|&s;equences, that they are not to be &s;epara|ted; and the Town of Dumfries, as well as Liverpool, Manche&s;ter, Whitehaven, and other Towns in England are Demon|&s;trations of it.</P>
<P>This Town is &s;ituated al&s;o for an In|crea&s;e of Commerce on the River Nid, for tho' it &s;tands near two Leagues from the Sea, yet the Tide flows up to the Town, and Ships of Burthen come clo&s;e up to the Key; but at about four Miles below the Town the large&s;t Merchant-Ships in Britain might come up, and ride in Safety.</P>
<P><PB REF="471">
There is a very fine Stone Bridge here over the River Nid; as al&s;o a Ca&s;tle, tho' of old Work, yet &s;till good and &s;trong enough; al&s;o an Exchange for the Mer|chants, and a Tolbooth, or Town-Hall $r the U&s;e of the Magi&s;trates. They $nd formerly a Woollen Manufacture here: $ut as the Union has, in &s;ome Manner, $$re&s;s'd tho&s;e Things in Scotland, the $span$ &s;upplying them fully, both better $d cheaper; &s;o they have more than an $word$ by an open Trade to all the $gli&s;h Plantations, and to England it|$f.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle in this Town, as well as at at Carlaurock, near the Mouth of the ver, and opening to the Firth of $word$ was formerly belonging to the $word$ Family of Nith&s;dale, the only $word$ Branch of which being unhappily $word$ in the late Rebellion, and taken Arms at Pre&s;ton, made his E&s;cape out the Tower, and is now abroad, but $er Forfeiture, That la&s;t mentioned $word$ has been a very magnificent Struc|ture, though now, like its Owner, in a $e of Ruin and Decay.</P>
<P>The River Nid here parts the two $nties of Galloway and Dumfries Shire; there is a Gate in the Middle of the ge which is the Limit between them: $word$ this Neighbourhood of Galloway, $h is a great and rich Province, $word$ the Trade of Dumfries very $word$.</P>

<P>Drumlanrig, like Chat&s;worth in Dar|by &s;hire, is like a fine Picture in a dirty Grotto, or like an Eque&s;trian Statue &s;et up in a Barn; 'tis environ'd with Moun|tains, and that of the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t hideous A&s;pect in all the South of Scot|land; as particularly that of Enterkin, the frightfulle&s;t Pa&s;s and mo&s;t dangerous that I met with, between that and Penmen|muir in North Wales; but of that in its Place.</P>

But that which was more &s;urpri&s;ing than all the re&s;t, was to &s;ee a Palace &s;o glorious, Gar|dens &s;o fine, and every Thing &s;o truly magnificent, and all in a wild, mountain|ous Country, the like we had not &s;een before; where, in a Word we &s;aw the Peak of Darby re&s;tored, (viz.) the fine&s;t Palace in all that Part of Britain, erected under the Mountains, full of Lead-Mines, and Quarries of Free&s;tone, and where no|thing, but what was de&s;olate and di&s;mal, could be expected, e&s;pecially if you come to it by the &s;aid Pa&s;s of Enterkin, or by the Mountains of Cumock and Carrick, more to the North We&s;t of the Place. This was certainly a Foil to the Build|ings, and &s;ets them off with all po&s;&s;ible Advantage; upon which the &s;ame Hand which before gave us the Lines upon the Waters of Buxton-Bath, being in the Company, be&s;towed the following upon Drumlanring Ca&s;tle.</P>

<P>The Building is Four-&s;quare, with Roundels in the inner Angels of the Court, in every one of which is a Stair-Ca&s;e, and a Kind of a Tower on the Top. This Way of Building, 'tis confe&s;s'd, does not &s;eem &s;o modern as the re&s;t of the Building; but as 'tis not &s;een in the Front, 'tis well enough.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e &s;tands on the Top of a ri&s;ing Ground, which, at its fir&s;t Building, lay with a &s;teep and uncouth De&s;cent to the River, and which made the Lookers on wonder what the Duke meant to build in &s;uch a di&s;proportioned Place: But he be&s;t und r&s;tood his own De&s;ign; for the Hou&s;e once laid out all that unequal De|&s;cent, is &s;o beautifully levell'd and layed out in Slopes and $erra&s;&s;es, that nothing can be better de&s;igned, or indeed, bet|ter performed than the Gardens are, which take up the whole South and We&s;t &s;ides of the Hou&s;e; and, when the whole De&s;ign will be done, the re&s;t will more ea&s;y, the Ground being a Plain the other Way, and the Park and Avenues compleatly planted with Trees.</P>
<P>At the Extent of the Gardens there are Pavillions and Banquetting-Hou&s;es, exactly an&s;wering to one another, and the Greens trimm'd, Spaliers and Hedges are in Perfection.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide is an&s;werable to the Out|&s;ide, the Apartments finely placed and richly furni&s;hed: And the Gallery may well be called a Gallery of Beauties, it|&s;elf's a Beauty.

<P>That this noble Per&s;on was Lord Com|mi&s;&s;ioner at the Time of the Union, &s;at in the Throne at the la&s;t Parliament of Scotland, and touched with the Scepter the Act of Parliament, which put an end to Parliaments for ever in that part of Great Britain, will always be Matter of Hi&s;tory to the End of Time; whether the Scots will remember it to the Advan|tage of the Duke's Character, in their Opinion, that mu&s;t be as their &s;everal O|pinions guide them.</P>
<P>This Duke's Monument, curiou&s;ly done in Marble at full Length, is al&s;o placed in the &s;ame Church at Di&s;dier, where he is buried with his Datche&s;s, a Daugh|ter of the Hou&s;e of Burlington in Eng|land.</P>
<P>But I dwell too long here. While I was at Drumlanrig, being de&s;ired by the $ate Duke to make &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on his Grace's E&s;tate there, which is $ery great, in Order to &s;ome Engli&s;h $mprovement, I, in particular, viewed $ome of the Hills to the North of the $a&s;tle, and having a Darby&s;hire C$$tle|$an with us, who was thoroughly ac|$$inted with tho&s;e Things, we di&s;co|$ered in &s;everal Places evident Tokens of $ead Mines, &s;uch as in D$$by&s;hire, and Somer&s;et&s;hire, are &s;aid never to fa$l; $d to confirm our Opinions in it, we $ok up &s;everal &s;mall Pieces of Oar in the Gulls and Holes, which the Rains had made in the &s;ides of the Mountains, and al&s;o of a plain Sparr, &s;uch as is not found any where without the Oar: But the Duke's Death put an end to the&s;e Enqui|ries, as al&s;o to &s;everal other Improvements then in View.</P>
<P>Here we were &s;urprized with a Sight, which is not now &s;o frequent in Scot|land as it has been formerly, I mean one of their Field Meetings, where one Mr. John Hepburn, an old Cameronian, preach|ed to an Auditory of near 7000 People, all &s;itting in Rows on the &s;teep &s;ide of a green Hill, and the Preacher in a lit|tle Pulpit made under a Tent at the Foot of the Hill; he held his Auditory, with not above an Intermi&s;&s;ion of half an Hour, almo&s;t &s;even Hours; and many of the poor People had come fifteen or &s;ixteen M$les to hear him, and had all the Way to go home again on Foot. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing to it, for my Bu&s;ine&s;s is not to make Remarks on &s;uch Things; only this I may add, that if there was an equal Zeal to this in our Part of the World, and for that Wor&s;hip which we acknow|led$e to be true, and of a &s;acred In&s;titu|tion, our Churches would be more throug'd on the Sabbath day than they are now. But that al&s;o by the Way.</P>
<P>From Drumlanrig I took a Turn to &s;ee the famous Pa&s;s of Ente$kin, or In|trokin Hill: It is, indeed, not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe; but by tell ng you that it a&s;cends through a winding bottom for near half a Mile, and a Stranger &s;ees nothing terri|rible, but va&s;t high Mountains on either Hand, tho' all Green, and with Sheep feeding on them to the very Top; when, on a &s;udden, turning &s;hort to the left, and cro&s;&s;ing a Rill of Water in the Bottom, you mount the Side of one of tho&s;e Hills, while, as you go on, the Bottom in which that Water runs down from between the Hills, keeping its Level on your Right, begins to look very deep, till at Length it is a Precipice ho$rible and terrifying; on the le$t the Hill ri&s;es almo&s;t perpendicular; till being come about half Way, you
<PB REF="474">
have a &s;teep, unpa&s;&s;able Height on the Left, and a mon&s;trous Ca&s;m or Ditch on your Right; deep, almo&s;t, as the Monu|ment is high, and the Path, or Way, ju&s;t broad enough for you to lead your Hor&s;e on it, and, if his Foot &s;lips, you have nothing to do but let go the Bridle, lea&s;t he pulls you with him, and then you will have the Satisfaction of &s;eeing him da&s;h'd to Pieces, and lye at the Bot|tom with his four Shoes uppermo&s;t I pa&s;|&s;ed twice this Hill after this, but the Weather was good, and the Way dry, which made it &s;afe; but one of our Com|pany &s;o frighted with it, that in a Kind of an Exta&s;y, when he got to the Bot|tom, he look'd back, and &s;wore heartily that he would never come that Way a|gain.</P>
<P>Indeed, there were &s;everal Things this la&s;t time we pa&s;s'd it, which rendered it more frightful to a Stranger: One was, that there had been, a few Days before, a &s;uddain Fro&s;t, with a great deal of Snow; and though, a little before the Snow, I pa&s;s'd it, and there was nothing to be &s;een; yet then I look'd down the fright|ful Precipice&punc; and &s;aw no le&s;s than five Hor&s;es in &s;everal Places, lying at the Bot|tom with their Skins off, which had, by the Slipperine&s;s of the Snow, lo&s;t their Feet, and fallen irrecoverably to the Bot|tom, where the Mountaines, who make light of the Place, had found Means to come at them, and get their Hides off.</P>
<P>But that which is mo&s;t remarkable of this Place is yet behind (viz.) that noted Story of the Whigs in the old per&s;ecut|ing Time, in King Charles IId's Time, and which I mu&s;t give you a &s;hort Ac|count of, for I have not Room for the whole Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>A Troop of Dragoons had been &s;ent, by Order of their commanding Officer, to di&s;turb a Field Meeting, &s;uch a one as I ju&s;t now de&s;crbed. The&s;e Meetings were &s;trictly forbidden at that Time, and the Mini&s;ter, if taken, was puni&s;hed with Death, without Mercy: The poor People of this Country being all, what they then called Cameronian and Whigs, ($word$ here, by the Way, the Word Whig be|gan fir&s;t to be known) I &s;ay, the People being zealous in their Way, would and did hold their Field Meetings, notwith|&s;tanding all the Prohibitions the Cour$ could make; upon which the Govern+ment quartered the Dragoons upon them with Orders, on all &s;uch Occa&s;ions, t$ di&s;per&s;e them, and what Pri&s;oners the too they were to carry to Edinburg$ e&s;pecially their Mini&s;ters. Accordi$g$ at this Time, there was an extrao$d$$$ Meeting of many Thou&s;and People, a$ the Dragoons marched to di&s;turb them.</P>
<P>As the whole Country were the Friends, the Dragoons could not $word$ $word$ immediately Notice would be taken, $word$ the Alarm given: The People at $word$ Meeting had always &s;ome &s;lout $word$ armed with Fire Arms, to prevent a $word$ prize, and they had &s;o now, enough have beaten off the Dragoons, if th$ had attacked them, but as they did covet Fighting and Blood, otherwi&s;e $word$ on Nece&s;&s;ity for their own Defence, that they had no timely Notice $word$ them, they cho&s;e to break up and per&s;e; and they were really $word$ when the Dragoons came to the Plac$</P>
<P>However, the Dragoons re&s;olving to lo&s;e their Labour, pur&s;ued the $word$ People, and ill u&s;ed &s;ome of $word$ took others Pri&s;oners, and among $he re&s;t, very unhappily &s;urprized Mini&s;ter, which was a Boo$y to $word$ and, as &s;oon as they had him, marched off directly to carry hi$ Edinburgh, where he might depend being hanged.</P>
<P>The poor People, terribly alarm the Lo&s;s of their Mini&s;ter; for $word$ in the World love their Mini&s;te$ them. The Cries of the one $word$ and cra&s;perating the othe$ and a &s;mall Body of tho&s;e who $word$ Guard before, but cho&s;e peacea$ &s;eparate, rather than di&s;pute it $word$ Dragoons, re&s;olved to re&s;cue th$ ni&s;ter, whatever it co&s;t.</P>
<P><PB REF="475">
They knew the Dragoons would carry him to Edinburgh, and they knew, that to do &s;o, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily go thro' this narrow Pa&s;s of $nterken: They were but thirteen Men on Foot; but being nimble Fellows, and knowing the private Ways prefectly well, they reach'd the Top of the Hill long before the Dra|goons; eight of them therefore plac'd them&s;elves in the Head of the narrow Way&punc; where the Dragoons were coming on one by one, or at mo&s;t two by two, and ve$y &s;oftly, you may believe, by the Nature of the Place.</P>
<P>The other five &s;liding down from the Top of the Hill, on the Left of the Pa&s;s, plac'd them&s;elves, as they found to their Advantage, being re&s;olved to &s;peak with the Troop as they came by. It was a thick Mi&s;t, as is often upon tho&s;e Hills, (indeed &s;eldom otherwi&s;e) &s;o that the Dragoons could not di&s;cover them, till they were within Hearing, nor then, &s;o as to know how many they were.</P>
<P>When the Dragoons came up within Hearing one of the five, boldly calls to the Commander by his Name, and bid him halt with his Troop, and advance no farther at his Peril; the Captain calls out again, who are you? and what would you have? They an&s;wered, deliver our Mini&s;ter; the Capta$n damn'd them a lit|tle, and march'd on: The Cameronian called to him again with a threatning Air, Will you deliver our Mini&s;ter? at which he reply'd, as loud, No, you Dog, and if you were to be damn'd; at which the Man fir'd immediately, and &s;hot him thro' the Heart, &s;o that he fell from his Hor&s;e, and never &s;poke a Word, and the frighted Hor&s;e, fluttering a little at the Fall of his Rider, fell down the Precipice, and there was an End both of Hor&s;e and Man together.</P>
<P>At that very Moment the eight Men, at the Head of the Pa&s;s, &s;hew'&s;t them|&s;elves, though at a Di&s;tance, and gave a Shout, which put the whole Body into a pannick Fear; for had they fir'd, and the Hor&s;es been put into the lea&s;t Confu&s;ion, half of them would have been down the Precipice immediately. In &s;hort, the Lieu|tenant that commanded next, being w$|&s;er then his Capt$in, gave them better Words and de&s;ir'd them to forbear firing for a minute or two; and after a very &s;hort Conference with his Men (for they had no more Officers to call a Council of War with) re&s;olv'd upon $word$ $word$ in which, upon their $span$ off and leave the Pais free, they deliver'd their Mini&s;ter, and they carry'd him off, and glad the Dragoons were of their De|liverance; for, indeed, if they had been 500 in&s;tead of 50, the thirteen men might have de&s;troyed them all; nay, the more they had been, the more certain would have been their De&s;truction.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t go back to Dumfries again, for this was but an Excur&s;ion from thence, as I ob&s;erved there: I re&s;olved, before I quitted the We&s;t Coa&s;t to &s;ee all that was worth &s;eeing on that &s;ide, and the next trip we made was into Galloway: And here, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I could not but look with grief and concern upon the Country and indeed upon the people.</P>
<P>Galloway, as I hinted before, begins even from the middle of the Bridge of Dumfries; the fir&s;t town on the coa&s;t, of any note, is Kirkubrigbt, or, as vul|garly called, Kirkubry. It mu&s;t be ac|knowledged this very place is a &s;urprize to a &s;tranger, and e&s;pecially one who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is ob&s;ervation, as mine was.</P>
<P>Here is a plea&s;ant &s;ituation, and ye nothing plea&s;ant to be &s;een. Here is $word$ harbour without Ships, a Port withou Trade, a Fi&s;hery without Nets, a People without Bu&s;ine&s;s; and, that which i$ wor&s;e than all, they do not &s;eem to de|&s;ire Bu&s;ine&s;s, much le&s;s do they under+&s;tand it. I believe they are very goo$ Chri&s;tians at Kirkubry, for they are in th$ very Letter of it, they obey the Text and are contented with &s;uch Things a they have. They have all the Material for Trade, but no Genius to it; all th opportunities for Trade, but no Inclina+tion to it. In a Word, they have $word$
<PB REF="476">
Notion of being rich and populous, and thriving by Commerce. They have a fine River, navigable for the greate&s;t Ships to the Town-Key; a Haven, deep as a Well, &s;afe as a Mill pond; 'tis a meer wet Dock, for the little I&s;land of Ro&s;s lyes in the very Entrance, and keeps off the We&s;t and North We&s;t Winds, and breaks the Surge of the Sea; &s;o that when it is rough without, 'tis always &s;mooth within. But, alas! there is not a Ve&s;&s;el, that de&s;erves the Name of a Ship, belongs to it; and, though here is an extraordinary Salmon Fi&s;hing the Sal|mon come and offer them&s;elves, and go again, and cannot obtain the Priviledge of being made u&s;eful to Mankind; for they take very few of them. They have al&s;o white Fi&s;h, but cure none; and Her|rings, but pickle none. In a Word, it is to me the Wonder of all the Towns of North Britain; e&s;pecially, being &s;o near England, that it has all the Invitations to Trade that Nature can give them, but they take no Notice of it. A Man might &s;ay of them&punc; that they have the Indies at their Door, and will not dip into the Wealth of them; a Gold Mine at their Door, and will not dig it.</P>
<P>It is true, the Rea&s;on is in part Evi|dent, namely, Poverty; no Money to build Ve&s;&s;els, hire Seamen, buy Nets and Materials for Fi&s;hing, to cure the Fi&s;h when it is catch'd, or to carry it to M$rket when it is cured; and this di&s;|courages the Mind, checks Indu&s;try, and prevents all manner of Application. Peo|ple tell us, that Slothfulne&s;s begets Po|verty, and it is true; but I mu&s;t add too, that Poverty makes Slothfulne&s;s, and I doubt not were two or three bri&s;k Mer|chants to &s;ettle at Kirkubry, who had Stocks to furni&s;h Ships and Boats for the&s;e Things, they would &s;oon find the People as indu&s;trious; and as laborious as in other Places; or, if they did not find them &s;o, when they felt the Benefit of it, ta&s;ted the Sweet of it, had Boats to Fi&s;h, and Merchants to Buy it when brought in; when they found the Money coming, they would &s;oon Work. But to bid Men trade without Money, labour without Wages, catch Fi&s;h to have them &s;tink, when they had done, is all one as to bid them work without Hands, or walk without Feet, 'tis the Poverty of the People makes them indolent.</P>
<P>Again, as the People have no Hands (that is, no Stock) to work, to the Gentry have no Genius to Trade; 'tis a Mechani&s;m which they &s;corn; tho' their E&s;tates are not able to feed them, they will not turn their Heads to Bu&s;ine&s;s or Improvement; they had rather &s;ee their Sons made Foot Soldiers, (than which, as Officers treat them now) there is not a more abject Thing on Earth, than &s;ee them apply to Trade, nay, to Merchan|dize, or to the Sea, becau&s;e tho&s;e Things are not (for&s;ooth) fit for Gentlemen.</P>
<P>In a Word, the common People all over this Country, not only are poor, but look poor; they appear dejected and di&s;couraged, as if they had given over al$ Hopes of ever being otherwi&s;e than what they are. They are, indeed, a &s;ober, grave, religious People, and that more, ordinarily &s;peaking, than in any other Part of Scotland, far from what it is in England; Conver&s;ation is generally &s;ober, grave; I a&s;&s;ure you, they have no A&s;|&s;emblies here, or Balls; and far from what it is in England, you hear no Oaths, or prophane Words in the Streets; and, if a mean Boy, &s;uch as we call Shoe-Blackers, or Black-Guard Boys, &s;hould be heard to &s;wear, the next Gentleman in the Street, if any happened to be near him, would cane him, and correct him; whereas, in England, nothing is more frequent, or le&s;s regarded now, than the mo&s;t horrid Oaths and Bla&s;phemies in the open &s;treets, and that by the little Chil|dren that hardly know what an Oath means.</P>
<P>But this we cannot Cure, and, I doub$ never &s;hall; and in Scotland, but, e&s;pe|cially in this Part of Scotland you have none of it to Cure.</P>
<P><PB REF="477">
It is the Honour of Scotland, that they are the &s;tricte&s;t Ob&s;ervers of the Lord's Day of any Nation in the World; and, if any part of Scotland are more Ob&s;ervers of it than the Re&s;t, it is in this Part, and all the Country f$om Dum|fries, and the Parts adjacent, to Gla&s;gow, and the Clyde, inclu&s;ive of both, the Towns of Dumfries and Gla&s;gow; and tho' this Country of Galloway may be the poore&s;t and empty of Commerce, it is, perhaps, the mo&s;t religious Part of all Scotland. Some People, I know, will not think that an Equivalent for their Poverty; as to that, let every Body think for them&s;elves; 'tis my Bu&s;ine&s;s only to relate the Fact, and repre&s;ent Things as they are.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, and there my Opinion concurs, they might be as religious and as &s;erious as they are; and the more &s;o, the better, and yet, they might at the &s;ame Time, be indu&s;trious, and apply them&s;elves to Trade, and to reap the Advantages that Nature offers them; might build Ships, catch and cure Fi&s;h, and carry them to all the Markets in Europe, as the Gia&s;gow Merchants &s;hew the Example. But the Hindrance is in the Nature of the Thing, the Po|verty of the Commons, and the Indo|lence of the Gentry forbid it; and &s;o Kirkubry, and all the Shores of Gallo|$ay mu&s;t remain unnavigated; the &s;ine harbours be unfrequented, the Fi&s;h be &s;ecu$e and &s;afe from Nets, till Time, and better Opportunities alter the Ca&s;e, or a People better able, and more inclined to Bu&s;ine&s;s, comes among them, and leads them into it.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;peak no more in generals, I left Kirkubright with a &s;ort of Con|cern; it is &s;o noble a Pro&s;pect, of what Bu&s;ine&s;s, and Commerce might, and I am per&s;uaded, $span$ or other will $o $word$ the $iver, $hat enters the Sea here, and makes the fine Harbour I men|tioned, is called the Dee, or the Dea, and is of a con&s;iderable long Cour&s;e, com|$n$ out of Mountains, in the remote&s;t Norrh Angle of this Shire, towards Car|rick; and, as it is full of Turnings and Meanders, more than any River in Scot|land, is &s;aid to run near 200 Miles in its Cour&s;e, as a River, tho' not above &s;eventy Miles in a Line; it is &s;ometimes on Occa&s;ion of Land Waters, a very great River, and remains &s;o longer than is u&s;ual in other Rivers.</P>
<P>The Country of Galloway lies due We&s;t from Dumfries, and, as, that they call the Upper Galloway, runs out far|ther than the re&s;t, into the Iri&s;h Seas, all that Bay or Sea, on the South Side of it may be reckoned Part of Solway-Firth, as all on the North Side is called the Firth of Clyde, though near 100 Miles from the River it&s;elf; as all that Sea in England, between South Wales, and the North Coa&s;ts of Devon and Corn|wall, is called the Severn Sea, even to the Lands End of England.</P>
<P>The We&s;ter Galloway, which is al&s;o called the Shire of Wigtoun, from the Town of Wigtoun, its Capital, runs out with a Peniniula, &s;o far into the Sea, that from the utmo&s;t Shores, you &s;ee the Coa&s;t of Ireland very plain, as you &s;ee Calais from Dover; and here is the Town of Port Patrick, which is the ordinary Place for the Ferry or Pa&s;&s;age to Belfa&s;t or other Ports in Ireland It has a tolerable good Harbour, and a &s;afe Road; but there is very little U&s;e for it, for the Packet Boat, and a few fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els are the Sum of the Navigation; it is true, the Pa&s;&s;age or Ferry is wide, and the Boats very indifferent, without the lea&s;t Con|venience or Accommodation; and yet, which is &s;trange, they very rarely, if ever mi&s;carry; nay, they told me there, they had never lo&s;t one in the memory of the olde&s;t Man in the Town, except one full of Cattle; which, heeling to one &s;ide more than ordinary, all the Cattle run to that &s;ide, and as it were, &s;lid out into the Sea.</P>
<P>Port Patrick has nothing in it to invite our &s;tay, 'tis a mean dirty homely Place; and as we had no Bu&s;ine&s;s here, but to &s;ee the Coa&s;t, we came away very ill &s;atisfied with our Accommodations. Upon a $word$
<PB REF="478">
near the Town, we could plainly &s;ee Ireland to the We&s;t, England, (viz.) the Coa&s;t of Cumberland to the South We&s;t, and the I&s;le of I&s;la, and the Mull of Kyntire to the North We&s;t.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;s'd the Penin&s;ula, which is formed by two arms of the Sea, one on the North Side called Lochrain, and the other on the South, called the Bay of Glenluce, we &s;top'd at Stranrawer; in the very Neck of Land, between both the&s;e $ulphs, are good Roads for Ships, and full of Fi&s;h, but &s;till here is no Genius for Trade, or for Sea Affairs of any Kind.</P>
<P>But now having &s;aid thus much of the Stupidity of the People of Galloway, and e&s;pecially on the Sea Coa&s;t, for not falling into Mercandizing; Fi&s;hing, &amp;c. which would doubtle&s;s turn to great Ac|count: I mu&s;t premi&s;e two Things, that I may not lead the Reader into an Error.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not &s;o with all the People on this We&s;tern Coa&s;t of Scotland, as we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee in the other Coun|tries, upon the Coa&s;t of Clyde, far|ther North, up to, and inclu&s;ive of Gla&s;gow it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. The People of Galloway it&s;elf are are not perfectly Idle, and neither the Country, or the People capable of any Thing; if it were &s;o, the Place would be uninhabited, and, in|deed, unhabitable; whereas, on the contrary, it is very populous, and full of Inhabitants, as well of Noble|men and Gentlemen, as of common People; all, which, I &s;hall explain in few Words.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not &s;o with all the People, they are not all &s;tupid, and without any No|tions of Commerce, Navigation, Ship|ping, Fi&s;hing, &amp;c. that is to &s;ay, tho' in Galloway they are generally &s;o, from the Coa&s;t, a little We&s;t of Dumfries, that is, from the Mouth of the River Fleet, yet to the Northward, and upon the Coa&s;t of Air, Kyle, and Cunningham; it is quite another Thing, as you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P N="2">2. The People of Galloway do not &s;tarve; tho' they do not fi&s;h, build Ships, trade Abroad, &amp;c. yet they have other Bu&s;ine&s;s, that is to &s;ay, they are mee$ Cultivaters of the Earth, and in particu|lar, breeders of Cattle, &s;uch as Sheep, the Number of which I may &s;ay is $word$ that is to &s;ay, innumerable; and bl$$k Cattle, of which they &s;end to England, if Fame lies not, 50 or 60000 every Year, the very Toll of which $span$ Union, was a little E&s;tate to &s;ome G$$tl$|men upon the Borde$s; and $span$ the Earl of Carli&s;le had a very good $$|come by it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the great Number of Sheep and Runts, as we call them in England, which they breed here; they have the be&s;t Breed of &s;trong low Hor&s;es in Br$tain, if not in Europe, which we call Pads, and fr$m whence we call all &s;mall tru$s &s;trong rid|ing Hor&s;es Galloways: The&s;e Hor&s;es are remarkable for being good Pacers, &s;trong, ea&s;y Goers, hardy, gentle, well $word$ and above all, that they never $word$ $nd they are very much bought up in Eng|land on that Account</P>
<P>By the&s;e three Articles, the Country of Galloway is far from being $word$ $word$ a poor Country; for the Wooll, as $word$ the Sheep, is a very great Fund of ye$r|ly Wealth to them, and the black Cat$le and Hor&s;es are hardly to be valued: The Gentlemen generally take their Rents $h Cattle, and &s;ome of them have &s;o g$$at a Quantity, that they go to England w$th their Droves, and take the Money $word$ $$|&s;elves. It is no uncommon $span$ a Galloway Nobleman to &s;end 4$00 S$e$p, and 4000 Head of black Cattle to E$$|land in a Year, and &s;ometime much more. Going from the lower $word$ way $word$ we were like to be d$$ven down the Stream of a River, tho' a Country$$n went before for our Guide, the $word$ &s;welling upon us as we pa&s;s'd, the $word$ was very &s;trong, &s;o that I was $span$ $o turn my Hor&s;e's Head to the $span$ and &s;o &s;loping over edged near the Sho$$ by degrees, whereas, if my $span$ &s;tood d$$ectly cro$s the Stream, he could have kept his Feet.</P>

This Part of the Country is very moun|tainous, and &s;ome of the Hills prodigious high; but all are covered with Sheed: In a Word, the Gentlemen here are the greate&s;t Sheep ma&s;ters in Scotland, (&s;o they call them&s;elves) and the greate&s;t Breeders of black Cattle and Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>But I was &s;ick of Galloway, thro' which, the Travelling is very Rough, as well for the Road, as for the Entertain|ment; except, that &s;ometimes we were received by the Gentlemen, who are $word$ very courteous to Strangers meerly as &s;uch, and we received many extraordinary Civilities on that only Ac|count.</P>
<P>We now entered the Shire of Air, full North from the Mull of Galloway, and $word$ before, we coa&s;ted the South Bay or Fi$h of Solway, parting England from $cotland; now we coa&s;ted the Firth or $word$ of Clyde, which, for above &s;ixty Miles lies on the We&s;t Side the Shore, $$anding away North Ea&s;t from the Point of the Mull, or North Point of Gallo|way: The Shire of Air is divided into three Parts, Carrick, Kyle, and Cun|$ingham.</P>
<P>Carrick is a more fruitful and better $$ltivated Country than Galloway, and $ot &s;o Mountainous; but it is not quite $word$ rich in Cattle, and e&s;pecially, not in $heep, or Hor&s;es. There is no con&s;ide|$$ble Port in this Part of the Country, $word$ the People begin to trade here, and $$ey are (particularly on the Coa&s;t) great $$&s;hermen, and take Abundance of Fi&s;h, $t not Merchants to carry it Abroad; $$metimes they are employed by the $word$ at Gla&s;gow, and other Places, to $word$ Herrings for them. Balgony is the $word$ Town, but tho' it &s;tands on the $a&s;t, it has no Harbour, and is a poor $tay'd Town, the Market is good, be|$$u&s;e there are many Gentlemen in the $$ighbourhood, and the Coa&s;t near it is $word$ of People, the Hou&s;es are mean, and $word$ and very coar&s;e: The Family of $word$ Earls of Ca&s;&s;ells, are Lords great Part of the Country, and has a good Antient Seat farther North, but we did not go to it; the late Earl of Ken|mure had &s;ome Intere&s;t here, but, as the Family was much &s;unk in Fortune, &s;o, both what was let here, and in Gallo|way, is gone, and the Honour extinct in the la&s;t Earl, who being beheaded for the late Rebellion, Ann. 1716. left nothing behind him worth naming in this Coun|try.</P>
<P>Coming to the North Bounds of Car|rick, we pa&s;s'd the River Dun, upon a Bridge of one Arch, the large&s;t I ever &s;aw, much larger than the Rialto at Venice, or the middle Arch of the great Bridge at York; we find many &s;uch in this Country, though, I think none &s;o very wide, except a Bridge between Gla&s;gow and Sterling; which, indeed, I did not mea&s;ure, though we might have done it, there being then no Water in the River. But this the People a&s;&s;ured us, was almo&s;t thirty Yards in Diameter, which, as I take it, is thirteen Foot wider than the Rialto.</P>
<P>This Bridge led us into the County of Kyle, the Second Divi&s;ion of the Shire of Air; and here I ob&s;erv'd, that, con|trary to what is u&s;ual, the farther North we travelled, the better, finer, and richer the Country was, whereas, ordinarily the farther North we expect it to be the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Kyle is much better inhabited than Car|rick, as Carrick is better than Galloway; and as the Soil here is better, and the Country plainer and leveller, &s;o on the Banks of the River, here are Abundance of Gentlemens Seats, &s;ome of them well planted, tho' mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es are old built, that is, Ca&s;tle-wi&s;e, becau&s;e of E|nemies. But now that Fear is over they begin to plant, and enclo&s;e after the Man|ner of England; and the Soil is al&s;o en|couraging, for the Land is fruitful.</P>
<P>Our Scotch Writers tell us a long Story of a great Battle in this Country, between King Coilus or Cylus a Briti&s;h King, and their Fergus I. where the former was kil|led, and from thence the Country took
<PB REF="480">
his Name; al&s;o another bloody Battle, An. 1263. between King Alexander III. of Scotland, and one Acho King of Nor|way, who came to the Port of Air with a great Fleet of Ships, and 20000 Men on Board who, after ravaging the Coun|try, was routed, and lo&s;t both his Army, and 140 Sail of his Ships. But the&s;e Scots Legends I &s;hall &s;ay nothing to.</P>
<P>The Capital of this Country is Air, a Sea Port, and as they tell us, was for|merly a large City, had a good Har|bour, and a great Trade: I mu&s;t acknow+ledge to you; that tho' I believe it never was a City, yet it has certainly been a good Town, and much bigger than it is now: At pre&s;ent like an old Beauty, it &s;hews the Ruins of a good Face; but is al&s;o apparently, not only decay'd and de|clin'd, but decaying and declining every Day, and from being the fifth Town in Scotland, as the I own&s;men &s;ay, is now like a Place for&s;aken; the Rea&s;on of its Decay, is, the Decay of its Trade, &s;o true is it, that Commerce is the Life of Nations, of Cities, Towns, Harbours, and of the whole Pro&s;perity of a Coun|try: What the Rea&s;on of the decay of Trade here was, or when it fir&s;t began to decay, is hard to determine; nor are the People free to tell, and perhaps, do not know them&s;elves. There is a good Ri|ver here, and a hand&s;ome Stone Bridge of four Arches.</P>
<P>The Town is well &s;ituated, has a very large ancient Church, and has &s;till a very good Market for all Sorts of Provi&s;ion. But nothing will &s;aye it from Death, if Trade does not revive, which the Town&s;|men &s;ay it begins to do &s;ince the U|nion.</P>
<P>From Air, keeping &s;till North, we came to Irwin, upon a River of the &s;ame Name; but barr'd and difficult, and not very good, when you are in; and yet, here is more Trade than at Air; nay, than at all the Ports between it and Dum|fries, exclu&s;ive of the la&s;t; particularly here is a con&s;iderable Trade for Scots Coal, of which they have plenty in the Neigh|bouring Hills, and which they carry by Sea to Ireland, to Belfa&s;t, to Carickfer|gus, and to Dublin it&s;elf, and the Com|merce occa&s;ioned by this Navigation be+tween the two Countries is very con&s;i+derable, and much to the Advantage o$ the Town of Irwin. They have al&s;o o$ late, as I was told, launched into a con|derable Trade Abroad to other Coun+tries, and have &s;ome &s;hare in the Fi&s;he|ry: But this I cannot come into the Particulars of here. The Town is the Capital of that Divi&s;ion of the Shire $word$ Ay$e, which they call Cunningham, and is really within the Firth of Clyde, though not actually within the River it&s;elf; they &s;tand &s;o advantagiou&s;ly for the Her$in, Fi&s;hing, that they cannot but go beyond their Neighbours of Greenock, who &s;ome times cannot come out as the Wind may blow, when the Fi&s;hing Boats of $word$ can both go and return.</P>
<P>As the Town is better employ'd it Trade than the other Parts I have been &s;peaking of, it is better built: Here are two hand&s;ome Streets, a good Key, and not only Room in the Harbour for a great many Ships, but a great many Ships in $word$ al&s;o; and, in a Word, a Face of Thi$$|ing appears every where among them.</P>
<P>As is the Town, &s;o is the Country in which it is &s;ituated; for when $word$ came hither, we thought our&s;elves $word$ England. Here we &s;aw no more Gal|loway, where you have neither Hedg$ or Tree, but about the Gentlemen's Hou&s;es whereas here you have beautiful Enclo|&s;ures, plea&s;ant Pa&s;tures, and Gra&s;s Ground$ and con&s;equently &s;tore of Cattle $word$ $word$ and provided.</P>
<P>The whole Country is rich and $word$ filled with Gentlemen's $word$ $word$ well-built Hou&s;es: It is &s;aid this $word$ the Country was owing to the $word$ Soldiers, who were placed here $word$ in Kyle by Oliver Cromwell; for at $word$ he built a Citadel, the vi&s;ible Appearanc$ of which remain &s;till, and the $word$ Soldiers prompted and encouraged $word$ People to enclo&s;e and improve $word$
<PB REF="481">
Lands, and in&s;tructed them in the Man|ner of Husbandry practi&s;ed in England, which they have never left off to this Day.</P>
<P>A little from Irwin is Kilmarnock Ca|&s;tle, the Seat of the Family of Boy'd, Earl of Kilmarnock; and on the other &s;ide the Ca&s;tle of Eglington, the S$at of the Fa|mily of Mon$gomery, Earl of Eglington, an ancient Hou&s;e; and the pre&s;ent E$rl is one of the riche&s;t Peers in Scotland. Ju&s;t upon the Borders of this County, North Ea&s;t, and where it joins to Cly$+d$le&punc; is the Ca&s;tle of London, the Fa|mily Seat of the Earl of London&punc; of the Family of Camp$ell, formerly Secretary of State to $word$ it is a noble and beautiful $word$</P>
<P>But I cannot de&s;cribe Hou&s;es: They come too thick upon me; be&s;ides, in a Country, as this is&punc; fu$l of Noblemen's and Gentlemen's Seats, I &s;hould never travel any farther if I did, I mean in this Volume.</P>
<P>With the Divi&s;ion of Cunningham I qu$tted the Shire of Ayre, and the plea|&s;ante&s;t Country in Scotland, without Ex|ception: Joining to it North, and or|dering on the Clyde it&s;elf, I mean the Ri|ver, lyes the little Shire of the Ren$r$w, or rather a Barony, or a Sheriffdom, call it as you will.</P>
<P>It is a plea&s;ant, rich, and populous, tho' &s;mall country, lying on the South Bank of the Clyde; the &s;oil is not thought to be &s;o good as in Cunningham: But that is abundantly &s;upplied by the many good Towns, the Neighbourhood of Gla&s;gow, and of the Clyde, and great Commerce of both. We kept our Rout as near along the coa&s;t as we could, from Ir|w$n; &s;o that we &s;aw all the coa&s;t of the $i$th of Clyde, and the very Opening of the Clyde it&s;elf, which is ju&s;t at the We&s;t Point, or corner of this county, for it comes to a narrow Point ju&s;t in that Place. There are &s;ome Villages and $i$hing Towns within the Mouth of the Clyde, which have more Bu&s;ine&s;s than large Port Towns in Galloway and Greenock; 'tis not an ancient Place, but &s;eems to be grown up in later Years, only by being a good Road for &s;hips, and where the &s;hips ride that come into, and go out from Gla&s;gow, ju&s;t as the &s;hips for London do in the Downs. It has a ca&s;tle to com|mand the Road, and the Town is well built, and has many rich Trading $ami|l$es in it. It is the chief Town $span$ We&s;t of Scotland $or the $word$ Fi&s;hing; and the Merchants of Gla&s;gow, who are concerned in the Fi&s;hery, employ the Greenock Ve&s;&s;els for the ca ching and cu$ing the Fi&s;h, and for &s;everal Parts of their other Trades, as well as carrying them afterwards abroad to Market</P>
<P>Their being ready on all Hands to go to Sea $word$ the Gla&s;gow Merchants of|ten leav their &s;hips to the care of tho&s;e Gre$no$$ M$$; and why not? for they are &s;en&s;ible they are their be&s;t &s;eamen; they are al&s;o excellent Pilots for tho&s;e difficult &s;eas.</P>
<P>The Abbey of Pa&s;ely is famous in Hi&s;tory, and to Hi&s;tory $ refer the En|quirer, it lyes on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Clyde, over again&s;t Gla&s;gow, the Remains of the Building are to be &s;een, and the Town bears &s;till the M$r$s of b ing for|tify'd When I tell you this was one of the mo&s;t eminent Mona&s;teries in Scot|land; that the building was of a va&s;t Ex|tent, and the Revenue in Proportion; you need not a&s;k if the &s;on was good the Lands rich, the Air healthful, and the country plea&s;ant The Prie&s;ts very $el|dom failed $o chu&s;e the be&s;t &s;ituation, and the riche&s;t and mo&s;t plea&s;ant Part of the country wherever they come&punc; witne&s;s St. Albans, S$&punc; Edmund's Bury&punc; Gla&s;tenbury, Canterbury; and al&s;o many in Scotland; as St. Andrew's, Haly-Ro d, Pa$$ly, and others.</P>
<P>The country between Pa$$ly and Gla&s;|gow, on the Bank of Cly e I take to be one of the mo&s;t agreeable pla es in Scot|land, takes its &s;ituation $span$ healthi|ne&s;s, the nea$ne&s;s of Gla&s;gow, the Neigh|bourhood of th &s;ea, and $$together at lea&s;t, I may &s;ay, I &s;aw none like it.</P>
<P><PB REF="482">
I am now come to the Bank of Clyde: My Method here as in England, forbids me wandring North, till I have given you a full View of the South. Two Rivers &s;eem to cro&s;s Scotland here, as the Trent and the Mer$ee cro&s;s England in the South, or as the Tyne and the Eden cro&s;s it in the North, or as the two Calders cro&s;s it in York&s;hire and Lanca&s;hire, which ri&s;e both out of the &s;ame Hill, and within a Mile of each other, and run one into the German Ocean at Hull and the other entring fir&s;t into the Ribble, runs into the Iri&s;h Sea below Pre&s;ton.</P>
<P>Thus this Clyde and the Tweed may be &s;aid to cro&s;s Scotland in the South, their Sources being not many Miles a$un|der; and the two Fir$hs, from the Firth of Clyde to the Firth of F$$th, have not an Interval of above twelve or fourteen Miles, which, if they were join'd, as might ea&s;ily be done, they might cro$e Scotland, as I might &s;ay, in the very Center,</P>
<P>Nor can I refrain mentioning how ea&s;y a Work it would be to form a Navigati|on, I mean a Navigation of Art from the Forth to the Clyde, and &s;o join the two Seas, as the King of France has done in a Place five times as far, and five Hun|dred times as difficult, namely from Thou|loze to Narbonne. What an Advantage in Commerce would this be, opening the Iri&s;h Trade to the Merchants of Gla&s;|gow&punc; making a Communication between the We&s;t Coa&s;t of Scotland, and the Ea&s;t Coa&s;t of England, and even to London it&s;elf; nay, &s;everal Ports of England, on the Iri&s;h Sea, from Liverpool Northward, would all Trade with London by &s;uch a Canal, it would take up a Volume by it|&s;elf, to lay down the &s;everal Advantages to the Trade of Scotland, that would im|mediately occur by &s;uch a Navigation, and then to give a true Survey of the Ground, the Ea&s;ine&s;s of its being per|formed, and the probable Charge of it, all which might be done; But it is too much to undertake here, it mu&s;t lye till Po&s;terity, by the ri&s;ing Greatne&s;s of their Commerce, &s;hall not only feel the Want of it, but find them&s;elves able for the Performance</P>
<P>I mentioned the neighbouring Situation of the Clyde&punc; and the Forth in this Place, only to ob&s;erve that I make that Line the Bound of this Circuit, and &s;hall &s;peak of nothing beyond it till my next. Suppo&s;|ing a Line drawn from Dunbarton to Sterling, exclu&s;ive of the fir&s;t, and in|clu&s;ive of the la&s;t; or rather &s;uppo&s;e it drawn from Gla&s;gow to Sterling, inclu&s;ive of both, becau&s;e both relate to the South or Lowland Part of Scotland.</P>
<P>I am now cro&s;s'd the Clyde to Gla&s;|gow&punc; and I went over dry-$ooted with|out the Bridge; on which Occa&s;ion I can|not but ob&s;erve h$w differing a Face the River pre&s;ented it&s;elf in, at tho&s;e two &s;everal Times when only I was there; At the fir&s;t, being in the Month of June, the River was &s;o low, that not the Hor&s;es and Carts only pa&s;s'd it ju&s;t above the Bridge, but the Children and Boys play|ing about, w$nt every where, as if there was no River, only &s;ome little &s;preading Brook, or Wa&s;h, like &s;uch as we have at Enfield-Wa&s;h, or Chel&s;ton&punc;Wa&s;h in Mid|dlelex; and, as I told you, cro&s;s'd it Dry foot, that is, the Water was &s;carce over the Hor&s;es Hoofs.</P>
<P>As for the Bridge, which is a lofty &s;tately Fabrick; it &s;tood out of the Wa|ter as naked as a Skeleton, and looked &s;omewhat like the Bridge over the Man|&s;anares, near Madrid, which I mention|ed once before; of which a French Am|ba&s;&s;ador told the People the Kin$ &s;hould either buy them a River, or &s;ell their Bridge, or like the Stone Bridge at Che&s;ter in the Street, in Northumberland, where the Road goes in the River, and the Peo|ple ride under the Bridge in dry Weather in&s;tead of riding over it. So when I $aw &s;uch a magnificent Bridge at Gla&s;gow, and e&s;pecially when I &s;aw three of the middle Arches &s;o exceeding large and high, beyond all the re&s;t, I could not but wonder, hardly thinking it po&s;&s;ible, that where the Pa&s;&s;age or Channel is $o ex|ceeding
<PB REF="483">
Broad, for the Bridge con&s;i&s;ts of eight Arches; the River, which in its ordinary Channel is &s;o narrow as it is higher up, and at a Di&s;tance from it, could ever fill up &s;uch a Height, where it has &s;o grand a Space to &s;pread it&s;elf as at the Bridge.</P>
<P>But my next Journey &s;atisfy'd me, when coming into Gla&s;gow from the Ea&s;t Side, I found the River not only had filled up all the Arches of the Bridge, but, running about the End of it, had fill'd the Streets of all that Part of the City next the Bridge, to the infinite Damage of the Inhabitants&punc; be&s;ides putting them into the greate&s;t Con&s;ternation imaginable, for fear of their Hou&s;es being driven away by the Violence of the Water, and the whole City was not without Apprehen|&s;ions that their Bridge would have given Way too, which would have been a ter|rible Lo&s;s to them, for 'tis as fine a Bridge as mo&s;t in Scotland.</P>
<P>Gla&s;gow is, indeed, a very fine City; the four principal Streets are the faire&s;t for Breadth, and the fine&s;t built that I have ever &s;een in one City together. The Hou&s;es are all Stone, and generally equal and uniform in Height, as well as in Front; the lower Story generally &s;tands on va&s;t Square Dorick Columns, not $ound Pillars and Arches between give Pa&s;&s;age into the Shops, adding to the $$rength as well as Beauty of the Build|$g; in a Word, 'tis the cleane&s;t and beau|$ulle&s;t, and be&s;t built City in Britain, London excepted.</P>
<P>It &s;tands on the Side of a Hill, &s;loping $o the River, with this Exception, that $he Part next the River is &s;lat, as is &s;aid $bove, for near one third Part of the Ci|$y, and that expo&s;ed it to the Water, up|$ the extraordinary Flood mention'd ju&s;t $ow.</P>
<P>Where the Streets meet, the cro&s;&s;ing $akes a &s;pacious Market place by the $$ture of the Thing, becau&s;e the Streets $e $o large of them&s;elves. As you come $$wn the Hill, from the North Gate to he &s;aid Cry&s;s, the Tolbooth, with the Stad-hon&s;e, or Guild-Hall, make the North Ea&s;t Angle, or, in Engli&s;h, the Right|hand Corner of the Street, the Building very noble and very &s;trong, a cending by large Stone Steps, wi h a$ I on $word$ Here the Town Council &s;it and $$e Ma|gi&s;trates try Cau&s;es, &s;uch as com with n their Cognizance, and do all t$eir pub|lick Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>On the Left hand of the &s;ame Street is the Univer&s;ity; the Building is the be&s;t of any in Scotland of the Kind; it was founded by Bi&s;hop Turnbull, Ann. 1454. but has been much enlarged &s;ince, and the Fabrick almo&s;t all new built. It is a very &s;pacious Building, contains two large Square, or Courts, and the Lodgings for the Scholars, and for $he Profe&s;&s;ors, are very hand&s;ome, the whole Building is of Free&s;tone, v ry high and very augu&s;t. Here is a Principal, with Regents and Profe&s;&s;ors in every Science, as there is at Edinburgh, and the Scholars wear Gowns, which they do not at Edinburgh Their Gowns here are red, but the Ma&s;ters of Arts&punc; and Profe&s;&s;ors, wear black Gowns, with a large Cape of Velvet to di&s;tingui&s;h them.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is an antient Building, and has a Square Tower in the Middle of the Cro&s;s, with a very hand&s;ome Spire upon it, the highe&s;t that I &s;aw in Scotland, and, indeed, the on y one that is to be called high. This, like St. G$les's at Ed|i burgh is divided now, and makes th$$e Churches, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, here is four or five more in the City, be&s;ides a Meeting or two: But there are very few of the Epi&s;copal D &s;&s;enters here; and the Mob fell upon one of their Meetings &s;o often, that they were obliged to lay it down, or, if they do meet, 't$s very privately.</P>
<P>The Duke of Mont$o&s;s has &s;o great an Intere&s;t here, and in the Country round, that he is, in a civil Sen&s;e, Governer of this City, as he is legally of their Uni|ver&s;ity His fine Hou&s;e at the North End of the City is not fini&s;hed, &s;o I need not enter upon a De&s;cription of it. As his Grace's Family is antient, and re&s;pect|ed

by the People as mo&s;t, if not as any of the Nobility of Scotland.</P>
<P>Gla&s;gow is City of Bu&s;ine&s;s; here is the Face of Trade, as well Foreign as Home Trade; and, I may &s;ay, 'tis the only City in Scotland, at this Time, that apparently E$$rea$es and Improves in both. The Union has an&s;wered its End to them more than to any other Part of Scotland, for their Trade is now form'd by it; and&punc; as the Union opened the Door to the Scots&punc; in our American Colonies, the Gla&s;gow Merchants pre|&s;ently $word$ in $word$ the Opportunity; and tho', when the $word$ was making, $he $span$ Gla&s;gow made the mo&s;t for $word$ Attempt to prevent it yet now th y k$$w better, $or they have the greate&s;t Addition to then Trade by it imaginable; and I am a&s;&s;ured that they &s;end near 50 Sail of Ships every Year to Virginia, New England, and other Eng|li&s;h Colonies in America, and are every Year increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>Could this City but have a communi|cation with the Firth of Forth, &s;o as to &s;end their Tobacco and Sugar by Water to Alloway, below Sterling as they might from thence again to London, Holland, Hambrough, and the Baltick, they would, (for ought I know that &s;hould hinder it) in a few Years double their Trade, and $end 100 Sail, or more.</P>
<P>The &s;hare they have in the Herring-$$&s;hery is very con&s;iderable&punc; and they $word$ their Herrings &s;o well and &s;o much better than is done in any other Part of Great Britain; that a Gla&s;gow Her|ring is e&s;teemed as good as a Dutch Herring, which in England they cannot come up to.</P>
<P>As Scotland never enjoy'd a Trade to the Engli&s;h Plantations $word$ &s;ince the Uni|on, &s;o no Town in Scotland has yet done any Thing con&s;iderable in it but Gla&s;|gow: The Merchants of Edinburgh have attempted it; but they lye &s;o out of the Way, and the Voyage is not only &s;o much the longer, but &s;o much more ha|zardous, that the Gla&s;gow Men are always &s;ure to outdo them, and mu&s;t con&s;equently carry away that Part of Trad$ fr m them, as likewi&s;e the Trade to the S$u h, and to the Mediterranean, whether the &s;hips from Gla&s;gow go and come again with great Advantage in the Ri&s;que, &s;o that even in the In&s;uring there is one per Cent. Difference, which is a great Ar|ticle in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Merchant.</P>
<P>The Towns of Irwin and Dumf$ies are, as I hinted before, newly &s;t$pp'd into into this Trade too, and will, no que&s;tion, ta&s;te the &s;weets of it.</P>
<P>The Gla&s;gow Merchants have of late &s;uffered $word$ &s;candal in this Branch of Trade, as if they were addicted to the Sin of Smuggling; as to that, if others, for want of Opportunity, are not in ca|pacity to do the &s;ame, let tho&s;e who are not guilty, or would not, if they had Room for it&punc; throw the fir&s;t Stone at them; for my Part I accu&s;e none o$ them.</P>
<P>The Clyde is not Navigable for large &s;hips quite up to the Town, but they come to a Wharf and Key at New Por$ Gla&s;gow, which is within a very little o$ it, and there they deliver their Cargoes and either put them on &s;hore there, o$ bring them up to the city in Lighters The Cu&s;tom&punc;hou&s;e al&s;o is at Port Gla&s;|gow, and their &s;hips are repaired, $word$ up fitted out, and the like, either the$ or at Greeno$k where Work is done we$ and Labour cheap</P>

<P>Nor are the Scots without a Supply Goods for &s;orting their Cargoes to Engli&s;h Colonies, even without $end|$ to England for them, or at lea&s;t not many of them; and 'tis needful to $tion it here, becau&s;e it has been ob|$ed by &s;ome that under&s;tood Trade $word$ that the Scots could not &s;end a &s;ort|$ Cargo to America without buying $word$ England; which Goods, &s;o bought $word$ mu&s;t come through many Hands, by long Carriage, and con&s;equently $ear bought, and &s;o the Engli&s;h Mer|$ts might under&s;ell them.</P>
<P>$word$ to an&s;wer this in the Language of Merchants, as it is a Merchant like Ob|jection: It may be true, that &s;ome Things cannot be had &s;o well as from Eng|land, &s;o as to make out a &s;ortable Car|go, &s;uch as the Virginia Merchants in London &s;hip off, who&s;e Entries at the Cu&s;tom hou&s;e con&s;i&s;t &s;ometimes of 200 Particulars; and they are at la&s;t fain to &s;um them up thus: Certain Tin, Turnery, Millinary, Uphold&s;tery, Cutlery, and Crooked-Lane Wares; that is to &s;ay, that they buy Something of every Thing, either for Wearing, or Kitchen, or Hou&s;e-Furniture, building Hou&s;es or Ships (with every Thing el&s;e in &s;hort) that can be thought of, except Ea$ing.</P>
<P>But though the Scots cannot do this, we may reckon up what they can fur|ni&s;h, and what is &s;ufficient, and lo$ne of which they can go beyond England in.</P>
<P N="1">1. They have &s;everal Woollen Manu|factures which they &s;end of their own Making; &s;uch as the Sterling Serges, Mu&s;clebrow Stuffs, Aberdeen Stockings, Edinburgh Shalloons, Blankets, &amp;c. So that they are not quite de&s;titute in the Woollen Manu|facture, tho' that is the principal Thing in which England can outdo them.</P>
<P N="2">2 The Trade with England being open, they have now, all the Manche&s;ter Wares, Sheffield Wares, and New|ca&s;tle hard Wares; as al&s;o the Cloths, Kerleys, Half thicks, Du&s;&s;els, Stock|ings, and coar&s;e Manufactures of the North of England, as cheap brought to them by Hor&s;e&punc;packs as they can be carried to London, nor is the Carriage farther, and, in &s;ome Articles, not &s;o far by much.</P>
<P N="3">3. They have Linnens of mo&s;t Kinds, e&s;pecially Diapers and Table Lin|nen, Dama&s;ks, and many other Sorts not known in England, cheaper than England, becau&s;e made at their own Doors.</P>
<P N="4"><PB REF="486">
4. What Linnens they want from Hol|land, or Hamburgh, they import from thence as cheap as can be done in England; and for Mu&s;lins, their own are very acceptable, and chea|per than in England.</P>
<P N="5">5. Gloves they make better and chea|per than in England, for they &s;end great Quantities thither.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another Article, which is very con|&s;iderable here, is Servants, and the&s;e they have in greater Plenty, and up|on better Terms than the Engli&s;h; without the &s;candalous Art of Kid|napping, making Drunk, Wheedling, Betraying, and the like; the poor Peo|ple offering them&s;elves fa&s;t enough, and thinking it their Advantage to go; as indeed it is, to tho&s;e who go with &s;ober Re&s;olutions, namely, to &s;erve out their Times, and then be|come diligent Planters for them|&s;elves; and this would be a much wi&s;er Cour&s;e in England than to turn Thieves, and wor&s;e, and then be &s;ent over by Force, and as a Pre|tence of Mercy to &s;ave them from the Gallows.</P>
<P>This may be given as Rea&s;on, and, I belive, is the only Rea&s;on why &s;o many more of the Scots Servants, which go over to Virginia, &s;ettle and thrive there than of the Engli&s;h, which is &s;o certainly true, that if it goes on for many Years more, Vir|ginia may be rather call'd a Scots than an Engli&s;h Plantation.</P>
<P>I might go on to many other Particu|lars, but this is &s;ufficient to &s;hew that the Scots Merchants are at no Lo&s;s how to make up &s;ortable Cargoes to &s;end with their Ships to the Plantations, and that if we can out do them in &s;ome Things, they are able to outdo us in others; if they are under any Di&s;advantages in the Trade I am &s;peaking of, it is that they may per|haps, not have &s;o ea&s;y a Vent and Con|&s;umption for the Goods they bring back, as the Engli&s;h have, at London, or Bri&s;tol, or Liverpool; and that is $word$ Rea&s;on why they are now, as they $word$ &s;etting up a Wharf and Convenienc$$ $word$ Alloway in the Forth, in Order to $word$ their Tobacco's and Sugars thither $word$ Land-Carriage, and Ship them off the$ for Holland, or Hamburgh or London, $word$ the Market pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>Now, though this may be &s;ome Ad|vantage (viz) carrying the Tobacco fro$ fourteen to fifteen Miles over Land: ye$ if on the other Hand it be calculated ho$ much &s;ooner the Voyage is made fro$ Gla&s;gow to the Capes of Virginia. $word$ from London, take it one Time $span$ the Difference will be $ound $word$ Freight, and in the Expence $span$ and e&s;pecially in Time of $span$ Channel is throng'd with $span$ when the Ships wait to go $span$ fear of Enemies; $span$ Men are no &s;ooner out $span$ but they &s;tretch away $o the $word$ $word$ are out of the Wake of the $word$ $word$ im|mediately, and are oftentimes at the Capes of Virginia before the London $word$ get clear of the Channel. Nay, even $word$ Times of Peace, and take the Weather to happen in its u&s;ual Manner, there mu&s;t al|ways be allow'd, one Time with another&punc; at lea&s;t fourteen to twenty Days Difference in the Voyage, either Out or Home; which, take it together, is a Month or &s;ix Weeks in the whole Voyage, and for $word$ and Tear, Victuals and Wages, is v$ry con&s;iderable in the whole Trade.</P>
<P>I went from Gla&s;gow to the $word$ of Hamilton, or as we &s;hould call it $word$ Eng|land, to Hamilton-Hou&s;e, It is $he Pal$ce of Hamilton, and the Palace at Hamilton, for the Family, as according to th$ $word$ Dialect, Hamilton of that Ilk, that $word$ Place or Town of the &s;ame Name, $word$ the Town of Hamilton joins to the O$$|hou&s;es, or Offices of the Hou&s;e of Hamil|ton. The Hou&s;e is large as it is, tho' Part of the De&s;ign is yet unfin &s;hed; it is now a fair Front, with two Wings, two Wings more there are laid out in the
<PB REF="487">
Ichnography of the Building, but are not attempted; the Succe&s;&s;or, if he thinks fit, may build them.</P>
<P>The Front is very magnificent indeed, all of white Free&s;tone, with regular Or|naments according to the Rules of Art: The Wings are very deep, and when the other Wings come to be added, if ever $word$ &s;hall be, the two Sides of the Hou&s;e $word$ $hen be like two large Fronts rather than Wings; not unlike Beddington Hou&s;e, near Croydon in Surry, only much larger.</P>
<P>The Apartments are very noble, and fit rather for the Court of a Prince than the Palace or Hou&s;e of a Subject; the Picture$, the Furniture, and the Decorati|on o$ every Thing is not to be de&s;crib'd, $word$ by &s;aying that every Thing is $span$ fi$e and &s;uitable to the Genins of $span$ The late D$tche&s;s, $span$ it was, was H$i$e&s;s of the $span$ out marrying a Branch of the $word$ of Dougla&s;s, obliged him to take the Name of Hamilton, &s;o to continue the E&s;tate in the Name; and it has &s;uffi|ciently an&s;wered that End. That Match being ble&s;t with a truly glorious Succe&s;|&s;ion of &s;ix Sons, four of whom were Peers by Birth, or Creation (viz) The late Duke, or rather Earl of Arran, his Mother being alive, the Earls of Orkney, Se$k$rk, and Ruglen, be&s;ides the Lords Ba&s;il and Archibald Hamilton. But this by the Way:</P>
<P>The Situation of the Hou&s;e is fix'd to $ll the Advantage imaginable; it &s;tands n a plain, level Country, near enough to h$ Banks of the Clyde to enjoy the Pro&s;pect of its Stream, and yet far enough $nd high enough to be out of the Reach $f its Torrents and Floods, which, as you ave heard, are &s;ometimes able to terrify $word$ whole City.</P>
<P>The great Park is &s;aid to be &s;ix Miles $word$ Circumference, wall'd round with $one, but rough, and not well lay'd; the $ler Park is rather a great Enclo&s;ure than $word$ Park, yet they are both extremely well $nted with Trees, and add to the $nament of the whole. The great Park al&s;o is well &s;tock'd with Deer, and among them &s;ome very curious for the Kind, whether Natives of the Place, or of foreign Breed, I could not learn. The Gardens are finely de&s;igned, but I cannot &s;ay they are &s;o finely fini&s;hed, or &s;o nicely kept as tho&s;e at Drumlanrig, particularly the Court-yard, the Canals and Ponds, de|&s;igned with &s;ome other Gardens laid out in the fir&s;t Plan, are not compleated, and &s;ome not &s;o much as begun upon: So that the next Heirs have Room enough to divert them&s;elves&punc; and di&s;po&s;e of &s;ome of their &s;pare Trea&s;ure, to carry on and commpleat the true De&s;ign of their An|ce&s;tor.</P>
<P>The Mi$fortune of the late Heir, the Father of the pre&s;ent Duke, happen'd &s;o, as that he never came to the E&s;tate, for he was kill'd before the Duche&s;s Dowager died; &s;o that the E&s;tate, as I ob&s;erv'd, be|ing her own; remain'd in her Hands till afterward; whether this might not be the better for the pre&s;ent Heir, I &s;hall not de|termine, let others judge of that.</P>
<P>I was here in &s;ome Doubt, whether I &s;hould take the South or the North in the next Part of my Progre&s;s; that is to &s;ay, whether to follow up th$ Clyde, and &s;o into, and throguh Clyd&s;dale, and then cro&s;&s;ing Ea&s;t, view the Shire of Peebles, the Country on the Banks of Tweed and Tivyot, or keeping to the North, go on for the Forth, and after a &s;hort Debate we concluded on the latter. So we turn'd to the left for Sterling-Shire, and pa&s;&s;ing $he Clyde we came to Kil$yth, a good plain Country Burgh, tolerably well built, but not large; here we re&s;ted, and upon a particular Occa&s;ion went to &s;ee the antient Seat of Calendar, which &s;eems, as well as that of Kil$yth, to be in 'its Widows Weeds, tho&s;e two Families&punc; collateral Branches both of the Name o$ Living&s;ton, having had $word$ are, but little cays, though on differen Earl of Mar, of the Town of Falkirk is near aims to be Here|but nothing in it remarking's Children, other old decay'd Hou&s;e of as Calendar.</P>
<P><PB REF="488">
Here I mu&s;t take Notice, though, as I have often &s;aid, Antiquity is not my Bu|&s;ine&s;s, that we &s;aw the Remains, and that very plain, of the antient Work, which they call Severus's Wall, or Hadrian's Wall, or Grahams Dyke, for it is known by all the&s;e: The &s;hort of which Story is this; that the Romans finding it not on|ly difficult, but u&s;ele&s;s to them, to con|quer the Northern Highlands, and impo&s;|&s;ible to keep them, if conquer'd; con|tented them&s;elves to draw a Line, &s;o we now call it, cro&s;s this narrow part of the Country, and fortify it with Redoubts, and Stations of Soldiers to confine the Picts and Iri&s;h, and tho&s;e wild Nations which were without&punc; and defend the South Country from their Incur&s;ions, This Wall reach'd from Dunbriton Firth, &s;o they call'd the Firth o$ Clyde, to the Forth, and was &s;everal times re&s;tor'd and repair'd, till the Roman Empire's declin|ing, as is well known in Story Tho' neither this, or the yet &s;tronger Wall at New-Ca&s;tle, call'd the Picts Wall, could pre&s;erve the Country from the Inva&s;ion of the Picts, and the barbarous Nations that came with them.</P>
<P>From Kil&s;yth we mounted the Hills black and frightful as they were, to find the Road over the Moors and Mountains to Sterling, and before directed by our Guides, came to the River Caaron: The Channel of a River appear'd, indeed, and running between horrid Precipices of Rocks, as if cut by Hand, no purpo&s;e for the River to make its Way; but not a Drop Water was to be &s;een. Great &s;tones, &s;quare and form'd, as if cut out by Hand, of a prodigious &s;ize, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t a Ton&punc; or Ton and half in Weight, lay &s;catter'd, and confu&s;edly, as it were, jum|bled together in the very Cour&s;e of the River, which the Fury of the Water, at other Times, I doubt not, had hurried down from the Mountains, and tumbled them thus over one another: Some of $span$ I &s;uppo&s;e, have been &s;ome $span$ Journey down the Stream; for it may not be once in &s;ome Years that a Flood comes with a $word$ &s;ufficient to move &s;uch Stones as tho&punc; $word$ and, 'tis probable, 'tis never $$ne, $word$ when a Weight of Ice, as well as $word$ may come down upon them $word$.</P>
<P>Here we pa&s;&s;ed another Br dge $span$ Arch, though no$ $span$ we &s;aw in Galloway, yet $span$ like, nor much &s;hort of $span$ built of $word$ but r$es $o h gh $word$ Shores being flat, $span$ Walls on $$|ther &s;ide are &s;o low&punc; $span$ is not every head can bear to $ide ov$.</P>
<P>The Truth is, there was $word$ to build the Bridge but with one $span$ $o Piers, they could have built in $span$ of the Channel, could $span$ born the Shock of tho&s;e great $span$ which &s;ometimes do come down this Stream.</P>
<P>From hence, de&s;cending on the North &s;ide, we had a View of the Fi$th, or Forth, on our Right, the Ca&s;tle of Ster|ling on the Left; and in going to the latter we pa&s;&s;ed the famous Water, for River it is not, of Bannock B$urn, fa|mous, in the Scots Hi&s;tory for th$ great Battle fought here between King $word$ de Bruce and the Engli&s;h Army, $span$ by King Edward II. in Per&s;on, $word$ wh ch the Engli&s;h were utterly $span$ and that with &s;o terr ble a $span$ that of the greate&s;t Army $span$ marched from England $span$ very few e&s;caped; and K ng $span$ with much a$o, &s;aved by $span$ indeed, he &s;hould &s;ave $word$ by a $word$ Boat&punc; (as Mr C$mbden &s;ays) that, in|deed, I cannot under&s;tand, there being no River near that had any B$at in it but the Forth, and that had been to make the King fly North; whereas to be &s;ure, he fled for England wi h all the &s;peed he could, he might, perhaps, make U&s;e of a Boar to the Tweed; but that was at lea&s;t thirty or forty miles off.</P>
<P><PB REF="489">
Whether the Scots magnify this Vic|tory, or not, is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s, that it was a total Overthrow of the Engli&s;h Army is certain, and that abundance of the Engli&s;h Nobility and Gentry lo&s;t their Lives there; but 'tis as true, that it was the $ll Conduct of the Engli&s;h at that Time, and the unfortunate King that led them on, which were the Occa&s;ion: His glorious Predece&s;&s;or, Edward I. or Edward $$I his more glorious Succe&s;&s;or, never lo&s;t &s;uch a Battle But let the Fault be where it will, this is certain, that the Engli&s;h lo&s;t the Day, and were horribly ma&s;&s;acred by the Scots, as well $span$ as in the Fight, for the Animo&s;ity $span$ between the two Nations, $word$ they gave but little Quarter on either $word$.</P>
<P>S$$rling was our next Stage, an ancient C$$$ or $own rather, and an important $span$ which, with Dumberton&punc; is indeed $span$ $efence of the Lowlands again&s;t the Highlands; and, as one very knowingly &s;aid, Dunbarton is the Lock of the $word$ and Sterling Ca&s;tle keeps the Key. The Town is &s;ituated as like Edinburgh as almo&s;t can be de&s;crib'd, being on the Ridge of a Hill, &s;loping down on both Sides, and the Street a&s;cending from the Ea&s;t gradually to the Ca&s;tle, which is at the We&s;t End; the Street is large and well built, but ancient, and the Buildings not unlike Edinburgh, either for Beauty or Sight</P>
<P>The Church is al&s;o a very &s;pacious Building, but not Collegiate; there was formerly a Church, or rather Chapel, in the Ca&s;tle, but it is now out of U&s;e; al&s;o a private Chapel, or Oratory in the Palace&punc; for the Royal Family: But all that is now laid a&s;ide too</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle is not &s;o very difficult of A ce$s as Edinburgh; but it is e&s;teem'd equally &s;trong, and particularly the Works are capable to mount more Cannon, and the&s;e Cannon are better pointed; particu|larly there is a Battery which commands, or may command the Bridge; the com|mand of which is of the utmo&s;t impor|tance; nay, it is the main End and Pur|po&s;e for which, as we are told, the Ca&s;tle was built.</P>
<P>They who built the Ca&s;tle, without doubt built, as the Scots expre&s;s it, to continue <HI>$ye,</HI> and till &s;omebody el&s;e &s;hould build another there, which, in our Language&punc; would be <HI>for ever</HI> and <HI>a Day after:</HI> The Walls and all the outer Works are fi$m, and if no Force is us'd to de|moli&s;h them, may continue inconceivable long, at lea&s;t we have Rea&s;on to believe they will; for though the other Buildings grow old, the Ca&s;tle &s;eems as firm and fa$r, as if it had been but lately built.</P>
<P>The Palace and Royal Apartments are very magnificent, but all in Decay, and m$&s;t be &s;o: Were the Materials of any U&s;e, We thought it would be much better to pull them down than to let &s;uch no|ble Buildings &s;ink into their own Rubbi&s;h, by the mee$ injury of Time: But it is at pre&s;ent the Fate of all the Royal Hou&s;es in Scotland; Haly-Rood at Edinburgh excepted: It is &s;o at Lithgow&punc; at Falk|land, at Dum$ermling, and at &s;everal other Places.</P>
<P>In the Park, adjoining to the Ca&s;tle, were formerly large Gardens, how fine they were I cannot &s;ay; the Figure of the Walks and Gra&s;s&punc;Plats remains plain to be &s;een, they are very old fa&s;hion'd; but I &s;uppo&s;e the Gardens might be thought fine, as Gardens were then; particularly they had not then the U&s;age of adorning their Gardens with Ever-Greens, trimm'd and &s;hap'd; Trees e&s;pa|lier'd into Hedges and &s;uch like, as now: They had, indeed, Statnes and Bu&s;ts, Vala, and Fountains, Flowers and Fruit; but we make Gardens fine now many Ways, which tho&s;e Ages had no Genius for; as by Scrouls, Embroidery, Pavilli|ons, Terra&s;&s;es and Slop$$, Pyramids and high E&s;paliers, and a Thou&s;and Orna|ments, which they had no Notion of.</P>
<P>The Park here is large and wall'd about, as all the Parks in Scotland are, but little or no Wood in it. The Earl of Mar, of the Name of Ere&s;kin, who claims to be Here|ditary Keeper of the King's Children,

as al&s;o Hereditary Keeper of the Ca&s;tle, has a Hou&s;e at the upper End of the Town, and very finely &s;ituated for Pro&s;pect, but I cannot &s;ay it is &s;o for any Thing el&s;e, for it is too near the Ca&s;tle; and was the Ca&s;tle ever to &s;uffer a clo&s;e Siege, and be vigorou&s;ly defended, that Hou&s;e would run great Ri&s;ques of being de|moli&s;hed on one Side or other; it &s;tands too near the Ca&s;tle al&s;o for the Sight of it to be agreeable.</P>
<P>The Governor's Lady (who was the Counte&s;s Dowager of Marr, when we were there, and Mother of the late ex|iled Earl of Marr, had a very pretty little Flower-Garden, upon the Body of one of the Ba&s;tions, or Towers of the Ca&s;tle, the Ambru&s;iers &s;erving for a Dwarf|wall round the mo&s;t Part of it; and they walked to it from her Lady&s;hip's Apart|ment upon a Level, along the Ca&s;tle-Wall.</P>
<P>As this little, but very plea&s;ant Spot, was on the North Side of the Ca&s;tle, we had from thence a mo&s;t agreeable Pro&s;|pect indeed over the Valley and the Ri|ver; as it is truly beautiful, &s;o it is what the People of Sterling ju&s;tly boa&s;t of, and, indeed, &s;eldom forget it, I mean the Meanders, or Reaches of the River Forth. They are &s;o &s;pacious, and return $o near them&s;elves, with &s;o regular and exact a Sweep, that, I think, the like is not to be &s;een in Britain, if it is in Europe, e&s;pecially where the River is &s;o large al&s;o.</P>
<P>The River Sein, indeed&punc; between Paris and Roan, fetches a Sweep &s;omething like the&s;e &s;ome Miles longer, but then it is but one; whereas here are three double Reaches, which make &s;ix Returns to|gether, and each of them three long Scots Miles, or more in Length; and as the Bows are almo&s;t equal for Breadth, as the Reaches are for Length, it makes the Fi|gure compleat. It is an admirable Sight indeed, and continues from a little be|low the great Bridge at Sterling to Allo|way, the Seat of the pre&s;ent, or rather late Earl of Marr, the pre&s;ent Earl being attainted for Trea&s;on, and &s;o dead, as a Peer or Earl, though alive in Exile. The Form of this Winding may be conceiv|ed of a little by the Length of the Way for it is near twenty Miles from Sterling to Alloway by Water, and hardly four Miles by Land.</P>
<P>One would think the&s;e large Sweeps, or Windings of the Stream &s;hould check the Tide very much: But, on the con|trary, we found the Tide of Flood made up very &s;trong under Sterling bridge, even as &s;trong almo&s;t as at London-bridge, but does not flow above &s;even or eight Miles farther: The Stream of the River growing narrow apace, and the rapid Current of all Rivers in that Country Checking the Tide, when it comes into narrow Limits; the fame is the Ca&s;e in the Tyne at Newca&s;tle, and the Tw$ d at Berwick; in both which, though the Tide flows &s;trong in at the Mouth of the Rivers, yet the Navigation goes but a very little Way up, nothing near what it does in this River.</P>
<P>The Bridge at Sterling has but four Arches, as I remember, but they are very large, and the Channel widens con&s;ider|ably below it; at Alloway 'tis above a Mile broad, and deep enough for Ships of any Burthen. So that the Gla&s;gow Merchants cannot but be in the Right to &s;ettle a Ware-hou&s;e, or Ware-hou&s;es, or whatever they will call them here, to Ship off their Goods for the Ea&s;tern Countries.</P>
<P>I was&punc; indeed, curious to enquire into the Cour&s;e of this River, as I had been before into that of the Clyde as to the Po&s;&s;ibility of their Waters being united for an Inland Navigation; becau&s;e I had ob&s;erved that the Charts and Plans of the Country brought them almo&s;t to meet; but when I came more critically to &s;ur|vey the Ground, I found the Map makers greatly mi&s;taken, and that they had not only given the Situation and Countes of the Rivers wrong&punc; but the Di&s;tances al&s;o. However, upon the whole, I brought it to this; that notwith&s;tanding &s;everal Cir|cum&s;tances
<PB REF="493">
which might ob&s;truct it, and cau&s;e the Workmen to fetch &s;ome wind|ing Turns out of the Way, yet, that in the whole, a Canal of about eight Miles in Length would fairly join the Rivers, and make a clear Navigation from the Iri&s;h to the German Sea; and that this would be done without any con&s;ider|able Ob&s;truction; &s;o that there would not need above four Sluices in the whole Way, and tho&s;e only to head a Ba&s;on, or Receptacle, to contain a Fla&s;h, or Flu&s;h of Water to pu&s;h on the Ve&s;&s;els this Way or that, as Occa&s;ion required, not to &s;top them to rai&s;e or let fall, as in the Ca&s;e of Locks in other Rivers.</P>
<P>How ea&s;y then &s;uch a Work would be, and how advantagious, not to Scotland only, but even to Ireland and England al&s;o, I need not explain, the Nature of the Thing will explain it&s;elf. I could en|ter upon particular De&s;criptions of the Work, and an&s;wer the Objections rais'd from the great Exce&s;s of Waters in the&s;e Streams in the Winter, and the Force and Fury of their Streams; But 'tis need|le&s;s, nor have we Room for &s;uch a Work here; be&s;ides, all tho&s;e who are acquaint|ed with &s;uch Undertakings, know that artificial Canals are carefully &s;ecur'd from any Communication with other Waters, except ju&s;t as their own Occa&s;ion for the Navigating Part demands; and that they are &s;o order'd, as to be always in a Con|dition to take in what Water they want, and ca&s;t off what would be trouble&s;ome to them, by proper Channels and Sluices made for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Gentlemen who have &s;een the Royal Canal in Languedoc from Narbon to Thoulou&s;e, as many in Scotland have, will be able to &s;upport what I &s;ay in this Ca&s;e, and to under&s;tand how ea&s;ily the &s;ame Thing is to be practis'd here; but I leave it to Time, and the Fate of Scot|land, which, I am per&s;waded, will one Time or other bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a very good Ho&s;pital at the upper End of this Town for poor decay'd Trade&s;men Merchants. They told us it was for none but Merchants, which pre|&s;ently brought Sir John Morden's Ho&s;|pital upon Black-Heath to my Thoughts; but I had forgotten where I was: And that in Scotland every Country Shop|keeper, nay, almo&s;t every Pether is cal|led a Merchant; which, when I was put in Mind of, I under&s;tood the Foundation of the Ho&s;pital better.</P>
<P>There is a ve y con&s;iderable Manufac|ture at Sterling, for what they call Ster|ling Serges, which are in Engli&s;h, Shal|loons; and they both make them and dye them there very well; nor has the Engli&s;h Manufacture of Shalloons broke in &s;o much upon them by the late Union, as it was fear'd they would. This Manufac|ture employs the Poor very comfortable here, and is a great Part of the Support of the Town as to Trade, &s;howing what Scotland might &s;oon be brought to by the Help of Trade and Manufactures; for the People are as willing to work here as in England, if they had the &s;ame En|couragement, that is, if they could be con&s;tantly employ'd and paid for it too, as they are there.</P>
<P>The Family of Eresk in is very con&s;ide|rable here; and be&s;ides the Earl of Marr and the Earl of Buchan, who are both of that Name, there are &s;everal Gentlemen of Quality of the &s;ame Name; as Sir John Ereskine of Alva, Colonel Ereskine, at that Time Governor of the Ca&s;tle; and another Colonel Ereskine, Uncle to the Earl of Buchan, a very whorthy and va|luable Gentleman, who, tho' he does not live at Sterling, has a con&s;iderable Intere&s;t there, and was at that Time Honourary Lord Provo&s;t of the Town.</P>
<P>We had here a very fine Pro&s;pect both Ea&s;t and We&s;t; Ea&s;tward we could plainly &s;ee the Ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and the Hill call'd Arthur's Seat, in the Royal Park at Haly-Rood-Hou&s;e; al&s;o the Opening Firth pre&s;ents all the Way from Alloway to the Queens-Ferry, mention'd above. North we co$ld &s;ee Dumfermling, and the Field of Battle, call'd Sheriff mu$r, bet|ween it and Sterling; and &s;ome told us
<PB REF="494">
we might &s;ee Dumba$ton Ca&s;tle We&s;t; but it was hazy that Way, &s;o that we could not &s;ee it, the Pro&s;pect South is confin'd by the Hills.</P>
<P>But our Bu&s;ine&s;s was not to the North yet; &s;till having a Part of the Border to view, that we might leave nothing be|hind us to oblige us to come this Way again: So we went from Sterling, fir&s;t Ea&s;t and then South Ea&s;t, over &s;ome of the &s;ame Hills, which we pa&s;s'd at our coming hither, though not by the &s;ame Road The Duke of Argyle has a &s;mall Hou&s;e, which the Family called the Low|land Hou&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e in Di&s;tinction from the many fine Seats and &s;trong Ca&s;tles which they were always po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of in the Highlands: This Seat was formerly belonging to the Earls of Sterling; and the County round it, South of the $orth, is called Sterling&s;hire, or Striveling&s;here, and &s;ends a Member to Parliament, as a Shire or County. The Family of the Earls of Sterling is extinct, at lea&s;t, if there are any of the Name, as is alledg'd&punc; they live ob&s;curely in England. They make great Complaint at Sterling, which they deprive from the Papi&s;ts, that the old Earl of Marr, who built the Family-Hou&s;e under the Ca&s;tle, as I have ju&s;t now &s;aid, was a Clergyman and Prior, or Abbot of the famous Mona&s;tery of Gambu&s;keneth, a Religious Hou&s;e, of the Order of the Augu&s;tines, which &s;tood not far off.</P>
<P>That upon the Reformation the &s;aid Abbot turn'd Prote&s;taut and married, and was created Earl of Marr: That he was &s;o zealous afterwards for the Change of Religion, that he &s;et his Hand to the demoli&s;hing his own Mona&s;tery; and that he brought away the Stones of it to Sterling, and built this fine Hou&s;e with them; upon which the Romani&s;ts branded him with Sacrilege and Avarice together, and gave him their Cur&s;e, which is not unu&s;ual in Scotland; which Cur&s;e, they tell you, now fell upon even the Hou&s;e it&s;elf, for that the Family being Heredi|tary Governors of Sterling Ca&s;tle; and be&s;ides, having another Hou&s;e at $word$ way, four Miles from it, the new $word$ Hou&s;e was never inhabited to this D$$ at lea&s;t not by the Family to $word$ belong'd, aud is at la&s;t forfeited to $word$ Crown.</P>
<P>This Clamour, however, did not $word$ him from going on with his Hou&s;e which he fini&s;h'd, as you &s;ee; but $word$ &s;uppo&s;ed tho&s;e Reproaches occa&s;ioned his &s;etting up &s;everal in&s;criptions, as $word$ withou$ the Hou&s;e as within; &s;ome of them are worn out with Time, others are legible; whereof this Di&s;tich in a Scots Dialect, I think, points at the Ca&s;e.</P>

<P>The Words &s;eem to want a Paraphra&s;e, which I &s;hall make as &s;hort $word$ as the Lines, though nor in Rhime; I take it to import much like the Duke of $word$ in&s;cription on the F$$ze of $word$ new Hou&s;e in the Park at St. $span$ <HI>Spectator fa&s;tidio&s;ns &s;ibi mole&s;tus&punc;</HI> the Builder had heard the Rumou$s and Re|proaches of the People, but bids them &s;peak out plainly, and &s;ay their wor&s;t; for that, if they con&s;ider'd well, and $ould &s;ay nothing but what was true, he had nothing to be concern'd at.</P>
<P>From Sterling, as I &s;aid, we came away We&s;t, and went directly to Lithgow, or Linlithgow, and from thence to Cly&s;dale, that is to &s;ay, the Country upon the Banks of the Clyde; in doing which $word$ we pa&s;s'd the old Roman Work a &s;econd Time, which I &s;till call Severus's W$ll, becau&s;e we are a&s;&s;ured Severus was the la&s;t that repaired it, though he might not make it; and more e&s;pecially, becau&s;e the Men of Learning there generally call it &s;o; the Remains of it are very plain to be &s;een.</P>
<P>There is nothing remarkable between Sterling and Lithgow but Bannockburn, which I have mentioned already, and &s;ome private Gentlemens Seats, too ma|ny to repeat.</P>
<P><PB REF="495">
Lithgow is a large Town, well built, and antiently famous for the noble Pa|lace of the Kings of Scotland, where K. James VI. and his Queen kept their Court in great Magnificence. This Court, though decaying with the re&s;t, is yet le&s;s decay'd, becau&s;e much later repaired than others; for King James repaired, or ra|ther rebuilt &s;ome of it: And his two Sons, Prince Henry, and Prince Charles, af|terwards King of England, had Apart|ments here; and there are the Prince of Wales's Arms, over tho&s;e, called the Princes Lodgings to this Day. Here it was that the Good Lord Murray, the Regent, who they called Good, becau&s;e he was really &s;o as he was riding through the Town into the Palace, was &s;hot mo&s;t $illainou&s;ly from a Window, and the Mur|derer was di&s;covered. He died of the Wound with the utmo&s;t Tranquility and Re&s;ignation, after having had the Satis|faction of being the paincipal Man in &s;ettling the Reformation in Scotland in &s;uch a Manner, as it was not po&s;&s;ible for the Popi&s;h Party to recover them&s;elves again; And after &s;eeing the common Peo|ple over the whole Kingdom embrace the Reformation, almo&s;t univer&s;ally, to his great Joy, for he was the mo&s;t zea|lous of all the Nobility in the Cau&s;e of the Reformation, and unalterably re&s;olved never to give Way to the lea&s;t Allowance to the Popi&s;h Court, who then began to $ave only a Toleration for them&s;elves, but could never obtain it; for this Rea&s;on the Papi&s;ts mortally hated him, and, at $ength, murdered him. But they got little by his Death, for the Reformers went on with the &s;ame Zeal, and never left, till they had entirely driven Queen Mary, and all her Popi&s;h Adherents out of the Kingdom, yet we do not find the true $urderer was ever di&s;covered: But this is latter of Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>At Lithgow there is a very great Linnen $anufacture, as there is at Gla&s;gow; and the Water of the Lough or Lake here, is e&s;teemed with the be&s;t in Scotland for Bleaching or Whitening of Linnen Cloth: So that a great deal of Linnen, made in other Parts of the Country, is brought $$ther either to be bleach'd or whiten'd.</P>
<P>The Church of St. Michael makes a Part of the Royal Building, and is the Wing on the Right Hand of the fir&s;t Court, as all the proper Offices of the Court made the Left: But the inner Court is the Beauty of the Building, was very &s;pacious, and, in tho&s;e Days, was thought glorious. There is a large Fountain in the middle of the Court, which had then Abundance of fine Things about it, where|of &s;ome of the Carvings remain &s;till.</P>
<P>Here the King's of Scotland, for &s;ome Ages kept their Courts on Occa&s;ion of any extraordinary Cetemony. And here K. James V. rein&s;tituted, or rather re&s;tored the Order of Knights of St. Andrew, as the Order of Knights of the Bath were lately re&s;tored in England. Here he erected Stalls, and a Throne for them in St. Michael's Church, and made it the Chapel of the Order, according to the U&s;age at Wind&s;or: The King him&s;elf wore the Badges of four Orders (viz) That of the Garter conferred on him by the King of England; that of St Andrew being his own; that of the Golden Fleece conferred on him by the Emperor, then King of Spain; and of St. Mic$ael, by which it appears he was a Prince very much honoured in the Wotld.</P>
<P>Al&s;o he fir&s;t ordered the Thi&s;tle to be added to the Badge of the Order; and the Motto, which &s;ince is worn about it in the Royal Arms, was of his Inven|vention (viz.) <HI>Nemo me impune Lace&s;|&s;it.</HI> The Gordon Verd, or Green Rib|band, was then worn by the Knights Companions: But the late King James II. or (as I &s;hould &s;ay, being in Scotland) the VIIth, changed it to the Blue Rib|band, as the Knights of the Garter wear it in England.</P>

Queen Anne, however, re&s;tored the Green Ribband again, and intended to have called a Chapter of the Order, and have brought it into its full Lu&s;tre again: But her Maje&s;ty was taken to Heaven before it could be done.</P>
<P>Lithgow is a plea&s;ant, hand&s;ome, well built Town; the Tolbooth is a good Building, and not old, kept in good Re|pair, and the Streets clean: The People look here as if they were bu&s;y, and had &s;omething to do; whereas in many Towns we pa&s;s'd through they &s;eem'd as if they looked di&s;con$olate for want of Employ|ment, the whole Green, fronting the Lough or Lake, was covered with Lin|nen Cloth, it being the bleaching Sea&s;on, and, I believe, a Thou&s;and Women and Children, and not le&s;s, tending and ma|naging the bleaching Bu&s;ine&s;s; the Town is &s;erved with Water by one very large Ba&s;on, or Fountain, to which the Water is brought from the &s;ame Spring which &s;erved the Royal Palace.</P>
<P>From Lithgow we turned to the Right, as I &s;aid above, into the Shire of Clyd&s;|dale: Some Bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o calling us this Way, and following the Clyde upwards, from a little above Hamilton&punc; where we were before, we came to Lanerk, which is about eight Miles from it due South.</P>
<P>From Lithgow, by this Way to Lanerk, is thirty long Miles; and &s;ome of the Road over the wilde&s;t Country we had yet &s;een. Lanerk is the Capital indeed of the Country, otherwi&s;e it is but a ve|ry indiferent Place; it is eminent for the a&s;&s;embling of the Bothwell-Bridge Rebel|lion, and &s;everal other little Di&s;tumbances of the Whigs in tho&s;e Days; for Whigs then were all Presbyterians, and Came|ronian Presbyterians too, which, at that Time, was as much as to &s;ay Rebels.</P>
<P>A little below Lanerk the River Doug|la&s;s falls into the Clyde, giving the &s;ame Kind of u&s;ual Surname to the Lands about it, as I have ob&s;erved other Rivers do, namely Dougla&s;sdale, as the Clyde does that of Clyd&s;dale, the Tweed that of Tweedale; and &s;o of the $e&s;t.</P>
<P>In this dull Vale &s;tands the antient, paternal E&s;tate and Ca&s;tle, which gives Name and (Title too) to the great Fa|mily of Dougla&s;s. The Ca&s;tle is very ill adapted to the Glory of the Family; but as it is the antient Inheritance, the Heads or Chief of the Name have always en|deavoured to keep up the old Man&s;ion, and have con&s;equently, made frequent Additions to the Building, which have mame it a wild, irregular Ma&s;s; yet there are noble Apartments in it, and the Hou&s;e &s;eems, at a Di&s;tance, rather a lettle Town than one whole Fabrick. The Park is very large, the Garden, or Yards, as they call them, not &s;et out with fine Plants or Greens, or divided into Flower-Gardens, Parters, Wilderne&s;&s;es, Kitchin-Gardens, &amp;c. as is the modern U&s;age. In &s;hort, 'tis an antient, magnificent P$le, great, but not gay; its Grandeur, in mo&s;t Parts, con&s;i&s;ts in its Antiquity, and being the Man&s;ion of one of the greate&s;t Families in Scotland above 1000 Years. The Hi&s;tory of the Family would take up a Volume by it&s;elf; and there is a Volume in Folio extant, written upon this Sub|ject only, where the Heroes of the Name are fully &s;et forth, and all the illu&s;trious Actions they have been concerned in. There are, at this Time, not lets than &s;ix or &s;even Branches of this Family, all ranked in the Peerage of Great Britain, namely, the Duke of Dougla&s;s, the Chief of the whole Clan or Name, the Duke of Queensberry and Dover, the Ea$ls of Morton, Dunbarton and March; and the Lords Mordingtoun and Forfar; the lat|ter was lately unhappily killed at the Fight near Dumblane, again&s;t the Lord Marr and the Pretender. But I mu&s;t not run out into Families; the Head Family of this Name has been in better Circum|&s;tances, as to E&s;tate, than they are at pre&s;ent: But the young Duke does not want Merit to rai&s;e him&s;elf, when Times may come that per&s;onal Merit may be

$word$ to rai&s;e Families, and make Men $eat.</P>
<P>From Lanerk we left the wild Place $lied Crawford Muir on the Right, the $&s;ine&s;s that brought us round this Way $ing fini&s;hed, and went away We&s;t into $e Shire of Peebles, and &s;o into Twee|$le, the fir&s;t Town we came to of any $ore upon the Tweed, is the Town of $eebles, Capital of the Country. The $own is &s;mall, and but indifferently built $$habited, yet the high Street has &s;ome $od Hou&s;es in it. There is a hand&punc; me Stone Bridge over the Tweed, which not a great River here, though the $$rent is &s;ometimes indeed very vio|$t.</P>
<P>The Country is Hilly, as in the re&s;t Tweedale, and tho&s;e Hills covered $th Sheep, which is, indeed, a principal $t of the E&s;tates of the Gentlemen; d the Overplus Quantity of the Sheep, al&s;o their Wool, is mo&s;tly &s;ent to Eng|$d, to the irreparable Damage of the $or; who, were they employed to Manu|$$ure their own Wool, would live much $ter than they do, and find the Benefit the Union in a different Manner, from $$t they have yet done,</P>
<P>Before the Union this Wool, and more th it, brought by Stealth out of Eng|$d went all away to France, &s;till (as I $ to the great Lots of the Poor, who, d they but &s;pun it into Yarn, and &s;ent $ Yarn into France, would have had $e Benefit by it; but the Union bring|g with it a Prohibition of the Expor|$ion upon the &s;evere&s;t Penalties, the $ntlemen of the Southern Countries $$plained of the Lo&s;s, at the time that $fair was tran&s;acted in Parliament; to $ke them Amends for which, a large $m of Money was appointed to them as Equivalent, and to encourage them to $ the Poor to work, as appears by the ct of Union; this Money, I &s;ay, was propriated by the Act to be employed &s;etting Hands to Work in Scotland, to manufacture their own Wool by their own People: How much of the Money has been &s;o employed, I de&s;ire not to examine, I leave it to them who&s;e pro|per Bu&s;ine&s;s it is.</P>
<P>Here are two Monuments in this Coun|try, all Scotland not affording the like, of the Vanity of wordly Glory. The one is in the Foundation of a Royal Pal|ace, or Seat of a Nobleman, once the fir&s;t Man in Scotland, next the King: It is a prodigious Building, too great for a Sub|ject, begun by the Earl of Morton, who&s;e Head being afterwards lay'd in the Du&s;t, his De&s;ign peri&s;hed; and the Building has not been cary'd on, and I &s;uppo&s;e never will.</P>
<P>The other is in the Palace of Traquair, built and fini&s;hed by the late Earl of Tra|quair, for &s;ome Years Lord High Trea&s;urer of Scotland, and a Per&s;on in the highe&s;t Po&s;ts, both of Honour and Profit in the Kingdom, who yet fell from it all, by the Adver&s;ity of the Times; for his Conduct under his Maje&s;ty King Chorles I being generally cen&s;ur'd, and him&s;elf univer&s;al|ly hated, he &s;unk into the mo&s;t abject and lowe&s;t Part of human Life, even to want Bread, and to take Alms, and in that mi&s;erabe Circum&s;tance died, and ne|ver &s;aw the Turn of the Times, I mean the Re&s;toration, which happened but a Year after his Death. The Hou&s;e is noble, the De&s;ign great, and well fini&s;hed, and no &s;ooner done &s;o but it was con&s;i&s;|cated, and the Owner turned out of it, to &s;eek his Bread from a Generation of his Enemies, who, thought they were merci&s;ul enough in &s;paring his Life; whe|ther it was &s;o or not, and what his Ac|tions were (perhaps none of the be&s;t) is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s; but, I think, it had been a kind of mercy to him, if they had rather taken his Head, the Condition he was reduced to, being doubtle&s;s, to a Man of any Spirit, much wor$e than Death; and, I Que&s;tion whether, if he had been an Engli&s;h Man, he would not
<PB REF="500">
have put an End to the Di&s;tre&s;s he was in, <HI>Brevi Manu;</HI> Not that I think that is the Way any Chri&s;tian Man ought to take to put an End to human Mi&s;ery, be the Condition here what it will, but that we find the Engli&s;h le&s;s able to bear &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;&s;es than other Nations, and apter to fly into Lunacies and De&s;peration, that I bel eve none will di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop Burner gives an Account of this Earl as a very mean &s;pirited, abject Per|&s;on, and one that &s;uffered him&s;elf to be made the In&s;trument of other Mens Mi&s;|chiefs, and that heretofore fell to much unpit$ed. But be that as it will, it is as I &s;ay, a remarkable Monament of the Vanity of human Glory; and it is the more remarkable for this&punc; that he was particularly drop'd and de&s;p$&s;ed by the Party he had &s;erved and who he had too faithfully adhered to; which is a Cau|tion to all that &s;hould come after him, to take Heed how they &s;acrifice them&s;elves for Parties, and again&s;t the true Intere&s;t of their Country&punc; they are &s;ure to be abanden'd, and of tho&s;e that are employ'd again&s;t.</P>
<P>Here we &s;aw the Ruins of the once famous Abbey of Mailro$s, the Great|ne&s;s of which may be a little judg'd of by its va&s;tly extended Remains, which are of a very great Circuit: The Building is not &s;o entirely demoli&s;h'd but that we may di&s;tingui&s;h many Places and Parts of it from one another; as particularly the great Church or Chapel of the Mona|&s;tery, which is as large as &s;ome Cathe|dra&s;s, the Choir of which is vi&s;ible, and mea&s;ures 140 Foot in Length, be&s;ides what may have been pull'd down at the Ea&s;t End; by the Thickne&s;s of the Foundations there mu&s;t have been a large and &s;trong Tower or Steeple in the Cen|ter of the Church, but of what Form or Height, that no Guels can be made at: There are &s;everal Fragments of the Hou&s;e it&s;elf, and the particular Offices belonging to it; the Court, the Cloy&s;ter, and other Buildings are &s;o vi&s;ible, as that $word$ to know it was a mo&s;t magnificent in tho&s;e Days. But the $word$ triump'd over all the&s;e Thing$ $word$ Pomp and Glory of Popety is $word$ into the primitive Simplicity of th$ Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion; nor can any&punc; &s;tant mourn the Lo&s;s of the&s;e $word$ of Super&s;tition, upon any $word$ that agree, either with his own $word$ or with the Chri&s;tian Pattern $word$ in the Scriptures. So I leave $word$ with a &s;ingular &s;atisfaction, at &s;eeing it is; much more than that of $word$ bring what it once was. I doubt had Traquair Hou&s;e been built with &s;tones of the Abbey, &s;ome People $word$ have placed all the Misfortunes of unhappy Builder to that Sacr$l$g$, $word$ noted in the Earl of Marr's Hou&s;e at $word$ But, as it happened, they had Room for that.</P>

<P>From hence we came to Kel$oe, a hand|$ome Market Town upon the Bank of $he Tweed.

<P>Kel&s;oe, as it &s;tands on the Tweed, and &s;o near the Engli&s;h Border, is a con&s;id$$|able Thorough Fair to England, one of the great Roads from $$inburgh to New|ca&s;tle lying through this Town, and a nearer Way by far than the Road through B$rwick.</P>
<P>They only want a good Bridge over the Tweed: At pre&s;ent they have a Fe$$y ju&s;t at the Town, and a good Ford through the River, a li $le below it; but, though I call it a good Ford&punc; and &s;o it is when the Water is $word$ yet that is too uncer|tain; and the Tw$$d is &s;o dangerous a River, and ri&s;es &s;$metimes &s;o &s;uddenly, that a Man &s;$arc$ knows, when he goes into the Water, how it &s;hall be 'ere he gets out at the other Side; and it is not very &s;trang$ to them at Kel&s;o, to hear of frequent $word$ in the Pa&s;&s;age, both to Men and Cat $word$</P>
<P>Here we made a little Excur&s;ion into England, and it was to &s;atisfy a Curio&s;ity of no extraordinary a Kind neither. By the &s;ight of Chev$ot Hills, which we had &s;een for many Miles Riding, we thought at Kel&s;o we were very near them, and had a great Mind to take as near a View of them as we could; and taking with us an Engli&s;h Man, who had been very curious in the &s;ame Enquiry, and who offered to be our Guide, we &s;et out for Wooller, a little Town lying, as it were, under the Hill.</P>
<P>Cheviot Hill or Hills are ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd the highe&s;t in this Part of England, and of Scotland al&s;o; and if I may judge, I think '$is higher a great deal than the Mountain of Mairock in Galloway, which they &s;ay is two Miles high.</P>
<P>When we came to Wooller we got an|ther Guide to lead us to the Top of the Hills for by the Way tho' there are ma|ny Hills and Reachings for many Miles, which are called Cheviot Hills, yet there is one Pico or Ma&s;ter Hill, higher than all the
<PB REF="502">
re&s;t by a great deal, which, at a Di&s;tance, looks like the Pico-T$neriffe at the Ca|naries, and is &s;o high, that I remember it is &s;een plainly from the Ro&s;emary Top in the Ea&s;t Riding of York&s;hire, which is near &s;ixty Miles. We prepared to clam|ber up this Hill on Foot, but our Guide laughed at us, and told us, we &s;hould make a long Journey of it that Way: But getting a Hor&s;e him&s;elf, told us he would find a Way for us to get up on Hor$eback; So we &s;et out, having five or &s;ix Country Boys and young Fellows, who ran on Foot volunt$er to go with us; we thought they had only gone for their Diver&s;ion, as is frequent for Boys; but they knew well enough that we &s;hould find &s;ome Occa&s;ion to employ them and &s;o we did, as you hall hear.</P>
<P>Our Guide led us very artfully round to a $art of the Hill, where it was evi|dent, in the Winter Sea&s;on, not Streams of Water, but great Rivers came pouring down from the Hill in &s;everal Channels, and tho&s;e (at lea&s;t &s;ome of them) very broad; they were overgrown on either B$nk with Alder-Trees, &s;o clo&s;e and thick, that we rode under them, as in an Arbour. In one of the&s;e Channels we mounted the Hill&punc; as the Be&s;iegers approach a forti|fyed Town by Trenches, and were got|ten a great Way up, before we were well aware of it.</P>
<P>But, as we mounted, the&s;e Channels le&s;&s;ened gradually, till at length we had the Shelter of the Trees no longer; and now we a&s;cended till we began to &s;ee &s;ome of the high Hills, which before we thought very lofty, lying under us, low and humble, as if they were Part of the Plain below, and yet the main Hill &s;eem|ed &s;till to be but beginning, or, as if we were but entring upon it.</P>
<P>As we mounted higher we found the Hill &s;teeper than at fir&s;t, al&s;o our Hor&s;es be|gan to complain, and draw their Haunches up heavily, &s;o we went very &s;oftly: How|ever, we moved and went on, till the Height began to look realty frightful, for, I mu&s;t own, I wi&s;he$ my felt down again; and now we found Ule for the young Fellows that run before us; for we began to fear, if our Hor&s;es &s;hould &s;tumble or &s;tart, we might $oll down the Hill together: and we began to ta$k of alighting, but our Gui$e called out and &s;aid, No, not yet, By and By you &s;hall; and with that he bid the young Fellows take our Hor&s;es by the Head &s;talls of the Bridles, and load them. They did &s;o, and we rode up higher &s;till, till at length our Hearts failed us all together, and we re&s;olved to alight; and tho' o r Guide mocked us, yet he could not pre|vail or per&s;uade us; &s;o we worked it up|on our Feer, and with labour enough, and &s;ometimes began to talk of going no farther.</P>
<P>We were the more unea&s;y about mount|ing higher, becau&s;e we all had a Notion, that when we came to the Top, we &s;hould be ju&s;t as upon a Pinnacle, that the Hill narrowed to a Point, and we &s;hould have only Room enough to &s;tand, with a Fre|cipice every way round us; and with the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions, we all &s;at down up|on the Ground, and &s;aid we would go no farther.</P>
<P>Our Guide did not at fir&s;t under&s;tand what we were apprehen&s;ive of; but at la&s;t by our Di&s;cour&s;e he perceived the Mi&s;take, and then not mocking our Fears, he told us, that indeed if it had been &s;o, we had been in the Right, but he a&s;&s;ured us, there was Room enough on the Top of the Hill to run a Race, if we thought &s;it, and we need not fear any thing of being blown off the Precipice, as we had &s;ugge&s;ted; &s;o he Encouraging us we went on, and reach't the Top of the Hill in about half an hour more.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge I was agreeably &s;urprized, when coming to the Top of the Hill, I &s;aw before me a &s;mooth, and with re&s;pect to what we expected a m$&s;t plea&s;ant Plain, of at lea&s;t half a M$le in
<PB REF="503">
$$meter; and in the Middle of it a large $nd, or little Lake of Water, and the $ound &s;eeming to de&s;cend every way $m the Edges of the Summit to the $nd, took off the little Terror of the $word$ Pro&s;pect; for when $e walkt to|$rds the Pond, we could but ju&s;t &s;ee $word$ the Edge of the Hill; and this little $word$ inwards, no doubt made the Pond, $word$ Ra$n water all running thither.</P>
<P>One of our Company a good Botani&s;t, $word$ to &s;earching for Simples, and, as he $word$ found &s;ome nice Plants, which he $word$ mightily pleas'd with: But as that $word$ of my way, &s;o it is out of the pre|$t De&s;ign. I m particular began to lo$k $at me, and to enquire what every $word$ was which I &s;aw more remarkably $$ing $t &s;elf at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Day happened to be very clear, $word$ to ur great Satisfaction very Calm $word$ the hight we were upon, would $ have been without its Dangers. We $ plainly here the Smoke of the $word$ at $word$ at the Mouth of the Tyne $word$ Miles below New Ca&s;tle; and $ch was South about forty Miles. The $word$ that is the German Ocean, was as $ut ju&s;t at the Foot of the Hill, and $ Guide pointed to &s;hew us the Iri&s;h $: But if he could &s;ee it, knowing it particular, and where exactly to look it, it was &s;o di&s;tant, that I could not $, I was a&s;&s;ured I &s;aw it. We &s;aw $word$ &s;everal Hills, which he told us were England, and others in the We&s;t of $tland, but their Names were too many $us to remember, and we had no Ma|$als there to take Minutes. We &s;aw wick Ea&s;t, and the Hills called Sout$a $word$ North, which are in &s;ight of Edin|$gh. In a Word there was a &s;urprizing $w of both the united Kingdoms, and were far from repenting the Pains we $ taken.</P>
<P>Nor were we &s;o afraid now as when fir&s;t mounted the Sides of the Hill, e&s;pecially we were made $word$ of the&s;e Fears, when to our Amazment, we &s;aw a Clergy&punc;man, and another Gentle|man, and two Ladies, all on Hor&s;eback, come up to the Top of the Hill, with a Guide al&s;o as we had, and without alight|ing at all, and only to &s;atisfy their Curi$|&s;ity, which they did it &s;eems. This in|deed made us lo$k upon one another with a Smile, to think how we were frighted, at our fir&s;t coming up the Hill: And thus it is in mo&s;t Things in Nature; $ear mag|nifies the Object, and repre&s;ents Things fightful at $word$ Sight, which are pre&s;ently made $a$y when they $word$ famili$r.</P>
<P>Satisfied with this View, and not at all thinking our Time or Pains $word$ $word$ &s;lowed we came down the $$$ll by $span$ Rout that we went up; with his Remark by the way, that wh$$her on Hor&s;eback or on Foot we found it much more trouble|&s;ome, and al&s;o tire&s;ome to come down than to go up.</P>
<P>When we were down, our Guide car|ryed us not to the Town of Wooller, where we were before, but to a &s;ingle Hou&s;e, which they call Wooller Haugh|head, and is a very good Inn, better in|deed than we expected, or than we had met with, except at Kel$o, for many Days Journey. Here we had very good Pre|vi&s;ion, very Hell Dre&s;s'd, and excellent Wine. The Hou&s;e is in England, but the People that kept it were Scots; yet every Thing was very well done, and we were mighty glad of the Refre&s;hment we found there.</P>
<P>Here we enquired after the famous Sto|ry of Cheviot Cha&s;e, which we found the People there have a true Notion of, not like what is repre&s;ented in the Ball$d of Chevy-Cha&s;e, which has turn'd the whole Story into a $able: But here they told us, what all &s;olid Hi&s;tories confirm, name|ly that it was an In road of the Earl of Dougla&s;s into England, with a Body of an Army, to ravage, burn, and plunder the Country, a$ was u&s;ual in the&s;e Days; and that the Earl of Northumberland,
<PB REF="504">
who was then a Piercy, gathering his Forces, marched with a like Army, and a great many of the Gentry and Nobility with him, to meet the Scots; and that both the Bodies meeting at the Foot of Cheviot Hills, fought a bloody Battle, wherein both the Earls were &s;lain, fight|ing de&s;perately at the Head of their Troops; and &s;o many kill'd on both Sides, that they that out-liv'd it, went off re&s;pectively neither being able to &s;ay which had the Victory.</P>
<P>They &s;hewed us the Place of the Fight, which was on the Side of the H$ll, if their Tradition do not n$&s;l$ad them, on the left hand of the Road the Ground uneven and ill enough for the Cavalry; 'tis $up|po&s;ed mo&s;t of the Scots were Hor&s;e, and therefore 'tis &s;aid, the Engli&s;h Archers placed them&s;elves on the Side of a &s;teep A&s;cent, that they might not be broken in upon the Hor&s;e. They &s;hew al&s;o two Stones which, if as I &s;ay they are not Mi&s;taken, are on the Ground where the two Earls were &s;lain.</P>
<P>But they &s;hewed us the &s;ame Day, a much more famous Field of Battle than this, and that within about &s;ix or &s;even Miles of the &s;ame Place, namely F$oden-Field, were James IV. King of Scotland with a great Army invading England, in the Year 15$8, when the King of England was ab&s;ent in his Wars abroad, at the Siege of Tournay, was met with, and &s;ought by the Earl of Surrey, of the ancient Family of Howard, and the Engli&s;h Army; in which the Scots, tho' $word$ a very ob&s;tinate $ight were totally $word$ and everthrown, and their King $word$ &s;ighting at the Head of his $word$ was &s;lain.</P>
<P>The River Till, which our Hi&s;torians call a deep and &s;wift River, and in which many of the Scots were drowned in the Pur&s;uit, &s;eemed to me not to be &s;uffi|cient to interrupt the &s;light of a routed Army, it being almo&s;t every where pa&s;|&s;able: But, perhaps, it might at that Time be &s;well'd with &s;ome &s;udden Rain, whic$ the Hi&s;torirns ought to have taken No|tice of; becau&s;e the River is el&s;e &s;o $s;ma that it would &s;eem to make us questio the re&s;t of the Story.</P>
<P>That was &s;uch a Battle, and that th was the Place, is out of all Doubt; an the Field &s;eems to be well of $word$ for it is a large Plain, &s;$ank'd on th North Side, wh ch mu&s;t be the $word$ Right, and the Engl &s;h Left, by $word$ $word$ Hill, and on the other S$de by $word$ Woods; the River $ill $word$ the Scots $ear; and the Tweed $word$ not f$r off.</P>
<P>$word$ viewed the&s;e Things, $word$ we had $word$ Time for in our $word$ through No thambe$land, we $span$ to Kel$$, and &s;pent the $word$ of $word$ that $en a$$'d there, viewing the $word$ try which is very $span$ f$l on both Sides the Twee$ $word$ Tweed there does not part $span$ Scotland, $span$ for four Miles, $span$ South Side of the Tweed, and the $word$ We&s;t the more the Tweed lies within t$ Limits of the Country.</P>
<P>From Kel&s;o we went North, $word$ pa&s;s'd through Lauderdale a long $word$ on both Sides the little River $word$ from whence the Hou&s;e of $word$ Earls fir&s;t, and at la&s;t Duke of Lauderdal$ took their Title.</P>
<P>The Country is good here, tho' $word$ with Hills on both Sides; the River $word$ runs in the Middle of it, keeping Cour&s;e North, and the Family $word$ Lauder, &s;tands about the Middle of $word$ Valley: 'Tis an ancient Hou&s;e, and $word$ large; nor did it receive any $word$ from Duke Lauderdale, who $word$ $word$ to di&s;po&s;e of his Fortunes another Way</P>
<P>From hence we kept the great $word$ over a high Ridge of Mountain, $word$ whence we had a plain View of th Part of the Country called $span$ and where we al&s;o &s;aw the C$$y of $word$

$$burgh at the Di&s;tance of about twelve $r fourteen Miles. We pa&s;s'd the&s;e Mountains at a Place which they call $outra Hill, and which gives the Title $word$ Laird of Soutra to a Branch of the $amily of Maitland, the elder Brother of $hich Hou&s;e was Lieutenant-General Mait|$$nd, a Gentleman of great Merit, and $ho rais'd him&s;elf by the Sword: He lo&s;t $$e of his Hands at the great Battle of $$$ves in Germany, where the French $rmy, under the Mare&s;chal De Crequi, $$$de&s;eated by the Germans, commanded $y the old Duke of Zell; he &s;upplyed $$e want of his Hand with one of Steel, $$om which he was called Handy Mait|$$nd.

<P>I could not pa&s;s this Way to Edin|$$rgh without going off a little to the $$ght, to &s;ee two very fine Seats, one $longing to the Marque&s;s of Louthian, $word$ the ancient Name of Ker, a younger $ranch of the Hou&s;e of Roxburgh, at $ewbattle or Newbottle. 'Tis an old $word$ but finely &s;ituated among the $span$ Walks and Rows of Trees, $word$ grown, and is particularly to be $word$ for the nice&s;t and be&s;t $word$ Collection of Pictures of any Hou&s;e have &s;een in Scotland: The Particulars $word$ too many to enter into a De&s;cription $word$ them. The Statues and Bu&s;ts are $word$ very fine; and there are the mo&s;t $word$ of particular Families and $word$ as well of the Royal Families France and England, as of Scotland $, that are, I believe, not only in $word$ but in any Palace in Europe.</P>
<P>Not two Miles from hence is the $word$ of $word$ Hou&s;e at Dalkeith, the fine&s;t and large&s;t new-built Hou&s;e in Scotland; the Dutche&s;s, Relict of the late Duke of Monmouth, has built it, as I may &s;ay, from the foundation, or as &s;ome &s;ay, upon the foundation of the old Ca&s;tle of Dalkeith, which was the E&s;tate of the Great Earl of Morton, Regent of Scot|land, who was beheaded by King James VI. that is, of England, James I. the &s;ame that brought the Engine to behead humane Bodies from Hall fax in York&s;hire, and &s;et it up in Scotland, and had his own Head cut off with it, the fir&s;t it was try'd upon.</P>
<P>The Palace of Dalkeith is, indeed, a magnificent Building, and the in&s;ide an&s;|werable to the Grandeur of the family. It &s;tands on a ri&s;ing Ground on the edge of the River E$k; the Side to the River is a Precipice, from whence it overlooks the Plain with a Maje&s;ty, like that of Wind&s;or, on the Bank of the Thames, with nece&s;&s;ary Allowance for the Diffe|rence of the C untry, and of the two Rivers, which bear, indeed, no Propor|tion. The Park is very large, and there are fine Avenues, &s;ome already made and planted, others de&s;igned, but not yet fi|ni&s;h'd; al&s;o there are to be Water Works, <HI>Jetle D' eans,</HI> and a Canal, but the&s;e are not yet laid out; nor are the Gar|dens fini&s;hed, or the Terra&s;&s;es, which will be very &s;pacious, if done according to the De&s;ign. There are many &s;ine Paintings e&s;pecially of the Ladies of the Engli&s;h Court, and &s;ome Royal Originals; but we mu&s;t not &s;peak of Pictures where Newbottle is &s;o high.</P>
<P>The Town of Dalkeith is ju&s;t with|out the Park, and is a pretty large Market Town, and the better market for being &s;o near Edinburgh; for there comes great Quantities of Provi&s;ions hither from the the Southern Countries, which are bought up here to be carried to Edinburgh mar|ket again, and &s;old there. The Town is well built, and is the better, no doubt, for the Neighbourhood of &s;o many Noblemens

and Gentlemens Hou&s;es of &s;uch Eminence in its Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>This brought us to the very Sight of the City of Edinburgh, where we re&s;ted a few Days, having thus fini&s;hed our Cir|cuit over the whole South of Scotland, on this Side of the River Forth, and on the South Side of the Forth of Clyde So I &s;hall conclude this Journey.</P>

<DIV1>
<HEAD>JOURNEY XIII.</HEAD>
<P>I AM now to enter the true and real Caledonia, for the Country on the North of the Firth is alone cal|led by that Name, and was antient|ly known by no other. As I &s;hall give an Acconut of it as it is, and not as it was; &s;o I &s;hall de&s;cribe it as I view'd it, not as other People have view'd it, nor &s;hall I con&s;ine my &s;elf to the Divi&s;ion of the Country, as the Geographers have divided it, or to the Shires and Counties, as the Civil Authority has divided it; or into Presbyteries and &s;ynodical Provinces, as the Church has divided it: But noting the Shires where I find them needful, I &s;hall give an Account of Things in the Order of my own Progre&s;s, and as I pa&s;s'd thro', or vi&s;ited them.</P>
<P>I went over the Firth at the Queens-Ferry, a Place mention'd before, &s;even Miles We&s;t of Edinburgh; and, as he that gives an Account of the Country of Fife, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily go round the Coa&s;t, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Places being to be &s;een on the Sea-&s;ide, or near it; &s;o I took that Method, and began at the Queens-Ferry. A Mile from hence, or &s;ome|thing more, is the Burrough of Inner|keithin, an antient wall'd Town, with a &s;pacious Harbour, opening from the Ea&s;t Part of the Town into the Firth of Forth; the Mouth of the Harbour has a good Depth of Water, and Ships of Burthen may ride there with Safety; but as there is not any great Trade here, and con&s;e|quently no U&s;e for Shipping of Burthen, the Harbour has been much neglected: However, &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els may come up to the Key, &s;uch as are &s;ufficient for their Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Town is large, and is &s;till popul|ous, but decayed, as to what it has for|merly been; yet the Market for Linnen not only remains, but is rather more con|&s;iderable than formerly, by rea&s;on of the Increa&s;e of that Manufacture &s;ince the Union. The Market for Provi&s;ions is al&s;o very con&s;iderable here, the Country round being very fruitful, and the Fami|lies of Gentlemen being al&s;o numerous in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>There was a tragical Story happened in this Town, which made it more talk|ed of in England, at that Time, than it had been before. The Lord Butleigh (a young Nobleman, but not then come to
<PB REF="507">
$s E&s;tate, his Father being living) had, $word$ &s;eems, had &s;ome Love Affair with a oung Woman in his Father's Family, but $uld not prevail with her to &s;acrifice&punc; her $irtue to him; upon which the Affair $ing made publick &s;he was removed out $word$ the Family, and he was per&s;uaded to $word$ or whether he went into the Ar|y, I do not remember; had, he $word$, it &s;eems, before he went abroad, that $word$ would marry her at his Return; which, $wever, it &s;eems the young Woman de|$ed too, as being too much below his $ality, and that &s;he would not be a $word$ to the Family: But he not $word$ declared he would marry her, cut, upon $word$ An&s;wer of hers, added, that if any $word$ el&s;e marryed here, he would murther $word$ as &s;oon as he came back: This pa&s; $word$ without much Notice, and the young oman was marryed, before his Return, a Schoolma&s;ter in this Town of $word$.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Time the Young Ma&s;ter they call the elde&s;t Son of a Lord, $ile his Father is living) of Burleigh, $r$s from his Travels, and enquiring the young Woman, and being told was marryed, and to whom, $word$ his helli&s;h Re&s;olution he rides away the Town, and up to the School Door, $word$ calling for the Schoolma&s;te, the $word$ at Man came out to him unarm'd in $$wn and Slippers; when, after asking $e was &s;uch a one, and flying out in $e hard Words upon him, he drew his $ol, and &s;hot the poor Man dead upon $word$ Spot, riding away in the open Day, $word$ no body da$ing to meddle with him.</P>
<P>But Ju&s;tice pur&s;uing him, and a Pro|mation being i&s;&s;ued, with a Reward of $word$ for apprehending him, he was at taken, and was tried at Edinburgh by Lord Ju&s;ti$cary, and condemned to e his Head cut off, and the Day of cution appointed. Nor could all the $ce&s;&s;ion of his Family and Friends $ail with the Queen, after her Ma|je&s;ty had a true Account of the Fact laid before her, to pardon or reprieve him: But the Day before the Execution his Friends found Means for him to make his E&s;cape out of the Tolbooth of Edin|burgh, di&s;gui&s;ed, in his Si&s;ter's Clothes.</P>
<P>In Return for this Deliverance he ap|peared in the late Rebellion, and was in the Battle of Dumblain or Sheri$$muir, but got off again; and his E&s;tate, which, however, was but &s;mall, was forfeited among the re&s;t. But the Murtherer is not yet brought to Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>This Tragedy, and its Circum&s;tances, I think, merits to be recorded, and the rather, becau&s;e mo&s;t of the Circum&s;tances came within the Verge of my Knowledge, and I was upon the Spot when it was done; there are many other Circum&s;tances in it, but too long to be repeated.</P>
<P>Near Innerkeithin, a little within the Land, &s;tands the antient Town of Dum|fermling, as I may &s;ay, in my Lord Roche&s;ter's Words, in its full Perfection of Decay; nay, the Decay is threefold.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here is a decay'd Mona&s;tery; for before the Reformation here was a very large and famous Abbey, but demoli&s;h'd at the Revolution; and &s;aving that Part of the Church was turn'd into a Parochial Church, the re&s;t, and greate&s;t Part of that al&s;o lyes in Ruins, and with it the Mo|numents of &s;everal Kings and Queens of Scotland; particularly that of Malcolm III. who founded the Mo|na&s;tery, as does all&s;o the Cloi&s;ter and Apartments for the religious People of the Hou&s;e, great Part of which are yet &s;o plain to be &s;een, as to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd one from another.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is a decay'd Court or Royal Palace of the Kings of Scotland. They do not tell us who built this Palace&punc; but we may tell them who &s;uffers it to fall down; for it is now (as it was ob&s;erv'd before all the
<PB REF="508">
Royal Hou&s;es are) &s;inking into its own Ruins; the Windows are gone, the Roof fallen in, and Part of the very Walls mouldered away by the Injury of Time, and of the Times. In this Palace almo&s;t all K. James the VIth's Children were born; as particularly King Charles I. and the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, afterwards Queen of Bohemia; and their Mother, which was Queen Ann Daughter of the Queen of Denmark, made this Place her particular Re&s;idence, which was al&s;o &s;ettled upon her, as her Dower or Jointure; here the built her&s;elf an Apartment, con&s;i&s;ting of eight Rooms over the Arch of the great Gate, which were her parti|cular Retirement, having a Gallery reaching from that Apartment to the Royal Lodgings.</P>
<P>The Figure of the Hou&s;e remains, but as for the Lodgings they are all, as I have &s;aid, in their Decay, and we may now call it the Monument of a Court.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is a decay'd Town, and we need go no farther for that Part than the Decay of the Palace, which is irrecoverable; there might be &s;ome|thing &s;aid here of what was done at this Town, upon&punc; receiving and crowning King Charles II. by the Covenanters, &amp;c. and which might, perhaps, contribute to entail a Di&s;|gu&s;t upon the Hou&s;e, and even upon the Place; and if it did &s;o, I fee no Rea&s;on to blame the King on that Account, for the Memory of the Place could not be plea&s;ant to his Maje&s;ty for many Rea&s;ons: But this is Matter of Hi&s;tory, and be|&s;ides, it &s;eems to have &s;omething in it that is not, perhaps, &s;o well to be remembered as to be forgot.</P>

<P>From hence, turning Ea&s;t, we &s;ee $word$ Seats of private Gentlemen, and $word$ of Noblemen, as particularly one $span$ to the &s;aid Marque&s;s of $word$ Aberdour.

<P>He that will view the Country of Fife mu&s;t, as I &s;aid before, go round the Coa&s;t; and yet there are four or five Places of Note in the Middle of the Country which are &s;uperiour to all the re&s;t, and mu&s;t not $e omitted; I'll take them as I go, though I did not travel to them in a direct Line, the names are as follow.

<P>Having &s;een Aberdour, I took a Turn, at a Friend's invitation, to Le&s;sly; but by the Way &s;topp'd at Kinro&s;s, where we had a View of two Things worth noting, 1. The famous Lake or Lough, called Lough Leven, where in an I&s;land, &s;tands the old Ca&s;tle where Queen Mary, commonly known in England by the Name of Queen of Scots, was confin'd by the fir&s;t Reform|ers, after &s;he had quitted, or had been forc'd to quit her Favourite Bothwel, and put her&s;elf into the Hands of her Subjects. One would have thought this Ca&s;tle, &s;tanding as it were in the middle of the Sea, for &s;o it is in its Kind, &s;hould have been &s;ufficient to have held her, but &s;he made &s;hift to get out of their Hands, whether by a Silver Key, or without a Key, I believe is not fully known to this Day.</P>
<P>The Lough it&s;elf is worth &s;eeing; 'tis very large, being above ten Miles about, and in &s;ome Places deep, famous for Fi&s;h. Formerly it had good Salmon, but now chiefly in Trouts, and other &s;mall Fi&s;h; out of it &s;lows the River Leven, which runs from thence to Le&s;sly.</P>

and regular Piece of Architecture, (for a private Gentlemen's Seat) in all Scotland, perhaps, in all Britain, I mean the Hou&s;e of Kinro&s;s. The Town lies at a little Di&s;tance from it, &s;o as not to annoy the Hou&s;e, and yet &s;o as to make it the more &s;ociable; and at the Town is a very good Market, and the Street tolerably well built.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e is a Picture, 'tis all Beauty; the Stone is white and fine, the Order re|gular, the Contrivance elegant, the Work|man&s;hip exqui&s;ite. Dryden's Lines, in|tended for a Compliment on his Friend's Poetry, and quoted before, are literally of the Hou&s;e of Kinro&s;s.

<P>Sir William Bruce, the skilful Builder, was the Surveyor General of the Works, as we call it in England, or the Royal Architect, as in Scotland. In a Word, he was the Kit Wren of North Britain; and his Skill in the perfect Decoration of Build|ing, has many Te&s;timonials left upon Re|cord for it; &s;uch as the Palace of Haly-Rood at Edinburgh; the Hou&s;e of Ro|the&s;s, and this at Kinro&s;s, be&s;ides &s;everal others.</P>
<P>The Situation of this Hou&s;e of Kin|ro&s;s would be di&s;liked by &s;ome for its be|ing &s;o very near the Water, and that &s;ometimes when the Lake is &s;welled by Winter Rains and melted Snows, the Wa|ter comes into, or at lea&s;t unto the very Gardens; but as the Country round is dry, free from &s;tagnated Boggs, and un|healthy Mar&s;hes; this little mediterranean Sea gives them very little Inconveni|ence, if any. Sir William, according to the new and laudable Method of all the Scots Gentlemen, has planted innumera|ble Numbers of Firr-Trees upon the E&s;tate round his Hou&s;e, and the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;or Mr. Bruce, is as careful to improve$ his Predece&s;&s;or: Po&s;terity will find the Sweet of this Pa&s;&s;ion for planting, which is &s;o happily &s;pread among the People of the South parts of Scotland, and which, if it goes on, will in Time make Scot|land a &s;econd Norway for Firt; for the Low Lands, as well as the Highlands, will be over-&s;pread with Timber.</P>
<P>Nor may it require &s;o many Ages &s;ome People imagine, for many of the large&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable Improve|ments are already of fifty to &s;eventy and eighty Years &s;tanding as at Melvil, L$$|ly, Te&s;ter, Pinkey, Newbattle, and &s;e|veral other Places; and others follow apace; &s;o that in forty or fifty Years more, as flow a growing Wood as $word$ yet there may be a Quantity of large grown Trees to be found to begin upon, &s;o as to cut out Deal-boards in great Num|bers, be&s;ides Sparrs, Bauks. Poles, $ars &amp;c. which the Branches will &s;upply.</P>
<P>From Kinro&s;s, I came to Les&s;ley, where I had a full View of the Palace of Rothds, both In&s;ide and Out&s;ide, as I had before of that of Bruce. The Magnificence of the In&s;ide at Les&s;ly is unu&s;ually great; but what is very particular, is the long Gallery, which is the full Length of one Side of the Building, and is fill'd w th Paintings, but e&s;pecially (as at $word$) of the great Ance&s;tors of the Hou&s;e of Rothes or Les&s;ly at full Lengths, and in their Robes of Office or Habits of Ceremony; particularly the late Duke of Rothe&s;s, who built the Hou&s;e, and who was Lord High Chancellor of Scotland.</P>
<P>I do not forget that the Rooms of State at Kinro&s;s are well &s;upplyed with Pictures and &s;ome very &s;ine and valuable Pieces, as particularly tho&s;e of King Charles I. and Henrietta Maria his Queen Daughter of France. But almo&s;t if not all the full Lengths in this Gallery of Rothe&s;s, are of the Family, and the immediate Ance&s;|tors from whom in a direct Line the pre|&s;ent Earl is de&s;cended, having been Peers,
<PB REF="511">
find in &s;ome or other of the greate&s;t Of|fices of Tru&s;t in Scotland, from the Year 1320 to 1725; &s;o that there may well be enough to cloath a Gallery, and they are there to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Robes and different Habits down to the great Founder of the Hou&s;e, who was Lord High Commi&s;&s;ioner to the Parliament, Lord High Trea&s;urer, and Lord Chancel|lor; and was created a Duke for his own Life only, &s;o that his Succe&s;&s;ors are now but Earls: But the Family are &s;till in the highe&s;t E&s;teem, and have gone thro' di|vers Po&s;ts of Honour and Tru&s;t. The Hou&s;e indeed in magnificent, I cannot &s;ay the Situation is &s;o much to Advantage as &s;ome other Seats; nor is there any large Avenue or Pro&s;pect from the Entrance, but it is a Pro&s;pect in its &s;elf; it is &s;ituat|ed on the Banks of the Leven ju&s;t where another &s;maller River joins it, and the Park on the South Side of the Hou&s;e is very beautiful, &s;ix Miles in Circumfer|ence, walled about, and in &s;everal Parts, little Woods of Firr$trees planted with Vi&s;tas reaching to them from the Hou&s;e, which gives a very beautiful Pro&s;pect. The Gardens are at the Ea&s;t End of the Hou&s;e well planted, and well de&s;igned, extending to the Angle or Point, where the two Rivers meet; &s;o that the Gardens are as it were watered on the North and on the Ea&s;t Side, and on the South Side are parted from the Park with a Wall; the We&s;t End of them beginning from the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e was built for the Duke mentioned above, in the Reign of King Charles II. by that Man of Art and Ma&s;|ter of building Sir William Bruce mention|ed there al&s;o, &s;o that the Building is wholly Modern. It is a Square, and the Fronts every Way are plain, that is, with|out Wings, and make a &s;quare Court with|in: Here it was King James II. lodged, mo&s;t part of the Time, when he was obliged by his Brother, King Charles II. to retire into Scotland while he was Duke of York; and his Apartments are marked in the Hou&s;e and called the Duke of York's Lodgings to this Day. They had a Com|munication with the long Gallery, and with the great Stairca&s;e at the other End.</P>
<P>The Town of Les&s;ly is at a &s;mall Di&s;|tance We&s;t from the Hou&s;e or a little North-We&s;t. There is a good Market, but otherwi&s;e it is not con&s;iderable. The Hou&s;e is the Glory of the Place, and in|deed of the whole Province of Fife.</P>
<P>From Lesfly, we turned away South to the Coa&s;t, and came to Brunti&s;land; this is a Port upon the Firth or Forth, and lies oppo&s;ite to Leith, &s;o that there is a fair Pro&s;pect as well of the Road of Leith, and the Ships riding there, as of the City and Ca&s;tle of Edinburgh. There is a very good Harbour which enters as if it had been made by Hand into the Center of the Town; for the Town is as it were built round it, and the Ships lay their broad Sides to the very Hou&s;es. There is Water enough at Spring-tides, for Ships of good Burthen to come into the Ba&s;in; but at Low-Water &s;ome of the Ships lye a Ground: But want of Trade renders all this u&s;ele&s;s; for what is the be&s;t Harbour in the World without Ships? And whence &s;hould Ships be expected without a Commerce to employ them; it is true, the Ships of &s;everal other Towns on the Coa&s;t frequently put into this Har|bour, to lay up, as we call it, and to lye by in the Winter: But this does not &s;o much better the Town as to make it be called a Trading Town; &s;o that, indeed, the Place is unhappy, and mu&s;t decay yet farther, unle&s;s the Trade revive, which, I con&s;e&s;s, I do not yet fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>Here is, however, a Manufacture of Linnen, as there is upon all the Coa&s;t of Fife, and e&s;pecially for that they call Green-cloth, which is now in great De|mand in England for the Printing-Trade, in the Room of Callicoes, which were lately prohibited.</P>
<P><PB REF="512">
Next to this is Kinghorn upon the &s;ame Coa&s;t, where, not the Sea, but the Manufacture upon the Land may be &s;aid to maintan the Place; for here is a Thread Manufacture, which they make very good, and bleach or whiten it them&s;elves, The Women, indeed chiefly, carry on this Trade, and the Men are generally Sea|men upon all this Coa&s;t, as high as the Queens-Ferry. Where I ob&s;erved the Men carry on an odd Kind of Trade, or Sport rather (viz.) of &s;hooting of Por|poi&s;es, of which very great numbers are &s;een almo&s;t con&s;tantly in the Firth; when they catch them thus, they bring them on Shore, and boil the Fat of them as they do of Whales, into Train Oil, and the like they do with &s;everal other great Fi&s;h&punc; which &s;ometimes they have Gram|pu&s;&s;es, Finn Fi&s;h, and &s;everal Species of the &s;mall Whale kind which come up there, and which they always make the be&s;t of, if they can take them. One Year in particular there came &s;everal &s;uch Fi&s;h on Shore, which they could find no Name for; there was eight or nine of them, which I &s;aw lying on the &s;hore of Fife, from Kinghorn to the Ea&s;ter Weems, &s;ome of which were twenty Foot long and upward.</P>
<P>But this Sort of Fi&s;hing is but by Ac|cident, and the Profit's not certain; the Firth affords a much more certain and profitable Fi&s;hery lower down, of which in its place. The Ferry, from Leith to the &s;hore of Fife&punc; is fix'd in this Town, though &s;ometimes the Boats in Di&s;tre&s;s, and by Force of Wind and Weather, are driven to run into Brunt I&s;land: This con|&s;tant Going and Coming of the Ferry-Boat, and Pa&s;&s;engers, is a&s;&s;o a con&s;ider|able Benefit to the Town of Kinghorn, and is a very great Article in its Com|merce.</P>
<P>Ea&s;t of this Town is Kirkcaldy, a larger, more populous, and better built Town than the other, and indeed than any on this Coa&s;t. Its Situation is in Length, in one Street running along th$ Shore, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, for a long Mile, and very well built, the Streets clean and well pav'e; there are &s;ome &s;mal By Streets or Lanes, and it has &s;ome con&s;iderable Merchants in it, I mean in the true Sen&s;e of the Word Merchant. There are al&s;o &s;everal good Ships belonging to ,he Town: Al&s;o as Fife is a good Cor$ Country, her are &s;ome that deal very largely $n Corn, and export great Qnan|tities both te England and Holland Here are great of Linnen &s;hipp'd off for Eng|land; and as the&s;e Ships return freighted either from England or Holland, they bring all needful Supplies of foreign Goods; &s;o that the Traders in Ki$kcaldy have really a very con&s;iderable Traffick, both at Home and Abroad.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Coal-Pits here, not only in the Neighbourhood, but even clo&s;e to the very Sea, at the We&s;t End of the Town, and where, one would think, the Tide &s;hould make it impo&s;&s;ible to work them. At the Ea&s;t End of the Town is a convenient Yard for building and repairing of Ships, and farther Ea&s;t than that &s;everal Salt Pans for the boyl|ing and making of Salt.</P>
<P>Kirkcaldy is a Member of the Royal Boroughs, as are al&s;o Brunti&s;land, King|horn, and Dy&s;ert, tho' almo&s;t all of them together are not equal to this Town: So that here are no le&s;s than four Royal Boroughs in the Riding of five Miles.</P>
<P>Dy&s;ert is next, a Town that gives the Title of Noble or Baron to the Lord Dy&s;ert, who re&s;ides $n England, tho' the Property both of the Town and the Lands adjoining belong to the Lord Sin|clare or St Clare: But be the E&s;tate whole it will, the Town though a Royal Burgh, is, as I &s;aid before of Dumfermling, in the full Perfection of Decay, and is, in|deed, a mo&s;t lamentable Object of a mi|&s;erable, dying Corporation; the only Sup|port, which, I think, pre&s;erves the Name of a Town to it, is, that here is, in the
<PB REF="513">
Lands adjoining, an excellent Vein of Scots Coal, and the Lord Dy&s;ert, the Landlord, has a good Salt-work in the Town; clo&s;e to the Sea there is a &s;mall Peer or Wharf for Ships, to come and load both the Salt and the Coal: And this, I think, may be &s;aid to be the whole Trade of the Town, except &s;ome Nailers and Hard-Ware Workers, and they are but few.</P>
<P>I take the Decay of all the&s;e Sea-port Towns, which 'tis evident have made a much better Figure in former Times, to be owing to the removing of the Court and Nobility of Scotland to England; for it is mo&s;t certain, when the Court was at Home, they had a Confluence of Strangers, Re&s;idence of foreign Mini&s;ters, being of Armies, &amp;c. and con&s;equently the Nobility dwelt at Home, &s;pent the income of their E&s;tates, and the Product of their Country among their Neighbours. The Return of their Coal and Salt, and Corn and Fi&s;h, brought them in Goods from Abroad, and, perhaps, Money; they &s;ent their Linnen and other Goods to England, and received the Returns in Money; they made their own Manu|factures, and though not &s;o good and cheap as from England, yet they were cheaper to the publick Stock, becau&s;e their own Poor were employed. Their Wool, which they had over and above, went to France, and return'd Ready Mo|ney. Their Lead went to Holland, and their Cattle and Sheep to England, and brought back in that one Article above 100,000 l. Sterling per Ann.</P>
<P>Then it was the Sea port Towns had a Trade, their Court was magnificent, their Nobility built &s;ine Hou&s;es and Pa|laces which were richly furni&s;h'd, and nobly fini&s;h'd within and without. They had infinitely more Value went out than came back in Goods, and therefore the Balance was evidently on their Side; whereas, now their Court is gone, their Nobility and Gentry &s;pend their Time, and con&s;equently their E&s;tates in Eng|land; the Union opens the Door to all Engli&s;h Manufactures, and &s;uppre&s;&s;es their own, prohibits their Wool going Abroad, and yet &s;carcely takes it off at Home; if the Cattle goes to England, the Money is &s;pent there too. The Troops rai&s;ed there are in Engli&s;h Service, and Scot|land receives no <HI>Premio</HI> for their Levies, as the might have done Abroad, and as the Swi&s;s and other Nations do at this Time.</P>
<P>This I take to be the true State of the Ca&s;e; and as this is not foreign to the De&s;ign of this Work, I am the longer upon it. I gave a particular Account in my De&s;cription of Gla&s;gow $word$ and Dumfries, to &s;hew you how tho&s;e Places were enrich'd by the increa&s;e of their Commerce, and how the Commerce was encrea&s;ed by the Union of the two King|doms. I mu&s;t likewi&s;e in Ju&s;tice, demon|&s;trate how and why the&s;e Sea-ports, on the Ea&s;t, decline and decay by the &s;ame Occa&s;ion, and from the &s;ame Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It is true, Scotland would have an ad|vantageous Trade with England, and not the wor&s;e for the Union were not the Court remov'd, and did not their Nobility dwell Abroad, and &s;pend their E&s;tates Abroad: Scotland has a plentiful Product for Exportation, and were the I&s;&s;ue of that Product return'd and con&s;um d at Home, Scotland would flouri&s;h and grow rich, but as it is, I may venture to &s;ay, it is not to be expected. For Ex|ample;</P>
<P>The Product of Scotland, I &s;ay, is very con&s;iderable, I mean that Part of it which is exported to foreign Parts, for what is con&s;umed at Home is nothing, that is to &s;ay adds nothing to the Pub|lick Stock of the Nation, &s;peaking of Scot|land as a Nation by her&s;elf.</P>
<P>All the Product of Scotland which is &s;ent Abroad, and exported to foreign Countries,
<PB REF="514">
and con&s;um'd there, is &s;o much clear Gain to the publick Stock, excepting only the Co&s;t of its Manufacturing at Home, or curing and &s;ending out; and except &s;o much as is brought back in Goods of the Growth, and Manufacture of foreign Countries, and is con&s;um'd in Scotland, which is not reckon'd as Gain, becau&s;e con&s;umed; if it is exported again, the Article goes to the Account of Publick Gain again. Now to &s;tate the Ca&s;e briefly between the Exportation and Importation of Goods in Scotland, that the Difference, which is the Balance of the Trade, may appear.</P>
<P>The Product of Scotland, which it ex|ports into foreign Countries, England in|cluded, for I am now con&s;idering Scot|land as if not united, is as follows.</P>

<P>And all the&s;e put together, if I am rightly informed, do not balance the Lead, Coal&punc; and Salt, which they export every Year: So that the Balance of Trade mu&s;t &s;tand greatly to the Credit of the Ac|count in the Scots Commerce.</P>
<P>And what then, would not &s;uch an annual Wealth in Sp$cie do for Scotland in a Year, it there was not a Gulph, in|to which it all runs as into a Sink.</P>
<P>I know this is abundantly an&s;wered, by &s;aying that Scotland is now e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in a la&s;ting Tranquillity; the Wars be|tween the Nations are at an End, the Wa&s;tings and Plunderings, the Ravages and Blood are all over; the Lands in Scotland will now be improved, their E&s;tates doubled, the Charges of defend|ing her Abroad and at Home lies upon England; the Taxes are ea&s;y and a&s;cer|tained, and the We&s;t India Trade $word$ pours in Wealth upon her; and this is all true; and, in the End, I am &s;till of Opinion Scotland will be Gamer: But I mu&s;t add that her own Nobility, would they be true Patriots, &s;hould then put their helping Hand to the ri&s;ing Ad|vantages of their own Country, and &s;pend &s;ome of the large Sums they get in Eng|land in applying to the Improvement of their Country, erecting Manufactures, em|ploying the Poor, and propagating the Trade at Home, which they may $ee plainly has made their united Neighbours of England &s;o rich.</P>
<P>Why might not the Wooll, which hey &s;end to England, be manufactur'd in Scot|land? If they &s;ay they know not how to make the Goods, or how to di&s;po&s;e of them when made, my An&s;wer is &s;hort; I know 'tis not the Work of Gentlemen to turn Manufacturers and Mercha ts: And I know al&s;o a Number of Projectors, that is to &s;ay, Thieves and Cheats, have teas'd and hang'd about them to draw them into Manufacturing only to bubble them of their Wooll and Mo|ney.</P>
<P><PB REF="516">
But here is a plain Scheme, let the Scots Gentlemen put their Stewards to Work to employ the poor People to &s;pin the Wool into Yarn, and &s;end the Yarn into England; 'tis an ea&s;y Manufacture, and what the Scots are very handy at, and this could never be difficult. They may have Patterns of the Yarn given them here, a Price agreed on, and good Security for payment: This can have no Difficulty; the Iri&s;h are fallen into this Way, to &s;uch a Degree, that 40000 Packs of Wool and Wor&s;ted Yarn are brought into England now every Year, and &s;old here, where, about thirty Years ago, not a Pound of it was imported ready &s;pun.</P>
<P>This, and many &s;uch Advantages in Trade, Scotland might find in her own Bounds, her Gentlemen a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Poor only with their Stocks of Wool; by which Means the Poverty and Sloth of the meaner People would be remov'd, and Scotland enrich'd: But I have done my Part, and have not Room to enlarge: Na|ture will dictate enough to the Gentle|men to go work upon it, if they have any De&s;ign to do their Country Good, and if a narrow and &s;elfi&s;h Spirit does not continue to prevail among them.</P>
<P>The decay'd Burghs being pa&s;s'd, we came to a Village called the Weems, or by Way of Di&s;tinction, the We&s;ter Weems, or Wemys. This is a &s;mall Town, and no Borough, belonging to the Earl of Weemys, who&s;e Hou&s;e &s;tands a little farther Ea&s;t, on the Top of a high Cliff, looking down upon the Sea, as Dover Ca&s;tle looks down upon the Strait, be|tween it and Calais, tho' not &s;o high.</P>
<P>The Account given lately of this no|ble Ca&s;tle of the Weemys is very Ro|mantick, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be laugh'd at by the Family it&s;elf who know the Hou&s;e. It is a very good Hou&s;e, and has one large Front to the Sea, but with|out any Wind&s;or-like Terra&s;s between the Hou&s;e and it, as is repre&s;ented. At the We&s;t End, upon the &s;ame Cliff, is a &s;mall Plain, $word$ $ad $word$ a Bowling. Green, and where the late Earl, being Admiral, had &s;ome &s;mall Field-Piece planted to an&s;wer Salutes Behind the Hou&s;e is a &s;mall and irregular Court Yard, with two Wings of Building, be|ing Offices to the Hou&s;e on one Side, and Stables on the other. Nor is there any Gardens, or Room for any, much le&s;s a &s;pacious Park, on the North &s;ide of the Hou&s;e; but the Road from the We&s;ter Weemys to the Ea&s;ter pa&s;&s;ing between, there is a large, well planted Orchard, and it is no other, nor other|wi&s;e intended; and as to a &s;pacions Park there is nothing like. There is a Piece of wa&s;t Ground planted with Firr-Trees at the Ea&s;t end of the Hou&s;e, but they do not thrive; nor would any Man cal$ it a Park, e&s;pecially for a Nobleman too that had &s;een what a Park means in England; but indeed, in Scotland they call all enclos'd Grounds Parks, w$ether for Gra&s;s or Corn: And &s;o they call al$ Gardens Yards; as St. Ann's Yards. at the Palace of Holy-Rood Hou&s;e, and the like in other Places.</P>
<P>From hence you pa&s;s through the $word$ Weemys to another Village, $span$ haven, inhabited $span$, by Fi&s;hermen, who&s;e $word$ is wholly to catch fre&s;h Fi&s;h every Day in the birth$ and carry to Leith and $word$ Mar|kets. And though this $span$ a m$$|&s;erable Row of Cottage like Buildings and People altogether meer Fi&s;hermen as I have &s;aid, yet there is &s;carce a poo$ Man in the Town, and in general the Town is rich.</P>
<P>Here we &s;aw the &s;hore of the Se$ covered with Shrimps, like the ground covered with a thin Snow; and as you rode among them they would ri$e like $word$ Kind of Du&s;t, being &s;car'd by the Footing of the Hor&s;e, and hopping like Gra&s;s hoppers.</P>
<P>The Fi&s;hermen of this Town have $word$ great many Boats of all &s;orts and &s;izes
<PB REF="517">
and &s;ome l$rge$, which lie upon the Beach unrigg'd, which every Year they fit for the Herring Sea&s;on, in which they have a very great-&s;hare.</P>
<P>Beyond this is the Methuel, a little Town, but a very &s;afe and good Har|bour, firmly built of Stone, almo&s;t like the Cobb at Lime, though not wholly projecting into the Sea, but &s;tanding with|in the Land, and built out with two Heads and Walls of thick &s;trong Stone, it &s;tands a little on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Mouth of the River Leven; the Salmon of this River are e&s;teemed the be&s;t in this Part of Scotland.</P>
<P>Here my Lord Weemys brings his Coal, which he digs above two Miles off, on the Banks of the River Leven, and here it is &s;old or &s;hipp'd off; as al&s;o what Salt he can make, which is not a great deal. Nor is the E&s;tate his Lord&s;hip makes from the &s;aid Coal-Works equal to what it has been, the Water having, after an immen&s;e Charge to throw it off, broken in upon the Weeds, and hinder'd their going on, at lea&s;t to any $word$ Advantage.</P>
<P>The People who work in the Coal $word$ in this Country, what with the $ejected Countenances of the Men, oc|$a&s;ion'd by their Poverty and hard La|$our, and what with the Colour or Di&s;|$olouring, which comes from the Coal, $oth to their Clothes and Complexious, $word$ well de&s;crib'd by their own Country|$an Samuel Colvil, in his famous Maca|$nick Poem, called, <HI>Polemo Midinia;</HI> $us,

<P>They are indeed, frightful Fellows at $word$ Sight: But I return to my $word$ from the Metl u l; we have &s;everal $word$ Towns on the Coa&s;t, as Crie&s; or $word$ P$tten-Weem, An&s;truther or An|&s;ter, as 'tis u&s;ually called: The&s;e are all Royal Burghs, and &s;end Members to Par|liament, even &s;till upon the New E&s;ta|bli&s;hment, in Con&s;equence only that now they join three or four Towns together to choo&s;e one or two Members, whereas they cho&s;e every Town for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Over egain&s;t this Shore, and in the Mouth of the Forth, oppo&s;ite to the I&s;le of the Ba&s;s, lyes the I&s;le of May, known to Mariners by having a Light-Hou&s;e upon it; the only con&s;tant inhabitant, is &s;aid to be the Man maintain'd there by the Government to take care of the Fire in the Light-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Here (you may ob&s;erve) the French Fleet lay with &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance, when the P$etender was on Board: And here the Engli&s;h Four a Clock Gun, on Board their approaching Squadron, unhappily gave the Alarm; &s;o that they immediately weigh'd, got under Sail, and made the be&s;t of their Way, the Engli&s;h pur&s;uing them in vain, sxcept only that they took the Salisbury, which was a con&s;iderable Way behind the Fleet, and could not come up with the re&s;t; the Story is well known; &s;o I need not repeat it.</P>
<P>The Shore of the Firth or Frith ends here, und the E&s;tuarium or Mouth open|ing, the Land of Fife falls off to the North, making a Promontory of Land, which the Seamen call Fife-Ne&s;s, look|ing Ea&s;t to the German Ocean, after which the Coa&s;t Trends away North, and the fir&s;t Town we &s;aw there was St. Andrew's, an ancient City, the Seat of an Archbi&s;hop, and an Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>As you mu&s;t expect a great deel of An|tiquity in this Country of Fife, &s;o you mu&s;t expect to find all tho&s;e antient Pieces murning their own Decay, and drooping and &s;inking in A&s;hes.</P>
<P>Here it was that old Limb of St. Luci|fer, Cardinal Beaton, ma&s;&s;acred and mur|der'd that famous Sufferer and Martyr of the Scot's Church, Mr. William Witharr,

whom he cau&s;ed to be burnt in the Parade of the Ca&s;tle, he him&s;elf, &s;itting in his Balcony to feed and glut his Eyes with the Sight of it.</P>
<P>The old Church here was a noble Structure; it was longer than St. Paul's in London by a con&s;iderable Deal, I think, by &s;ix Yards, or by twenty five Foot. This Building is now &s;unk into a &s;imple Pari&s;h Church, though there are many plain Di&s;coveries of what it has been, and a great deal of Project and Fancy may be employed to find out the antient Shape of it.</P>
<P>The City is not large, nor is is con|temptibly &s;mall; there are &s;ome very good Buildings in it, and the Remains of ma|ny more: The Colleges are hand&s;ome Buildings, and well &s;upplyed with Men of Learning in all Sciences, and, who go|vern the Youth they in&s;truct with Reputa|tion; the Students wear Gowns here of a Scarlet-like Colour, but not in Grain, and are very numerous: The Univer&s;ity is very antient as well as the City; the Foundation was &s;ettled, and the publick Buildings appointed in the Beginning of the fifteenth Century by King James I. 'Tis true, they tell us here were private Schools &s;et up many Ages before that, even as far back as 937; but I &s;ee no Evidence of the Fact, and &s;o do not pro|po&s;e it for your Belief, though 'tis very likely there was &s;ome Beginnings made before the King came to encourage them, &s;o far as to form an Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>There are three Colleges in all; the mo&s;t antient, and which, they &s;ay, was the Publick School &s;o long before, is cal|led St. Salvadote. How it was made to &s;peak Portugue&s;e, I know not, unle&s;s it might be that &s;ome Portugue&s;e Clergy|men came over hither as the fir&s;t Profe&s;|&s;ors or Teachers; in Engli&s;h it is St. Sa|viom's, in Spani&s;h it would be called No&s;tra Seigniora, or our Lord; and &s;o St. Maros would be called No&s;tra Dame de St. Andrew, or our Lady of St. Andrew's. This College of St. Mary's is called the New College, and the Middlemo&s;t, (for Age) is called St. Leonard's College.</P>
<P>The old College as I have &s;aid, though it was a School, as they affirm, above 200 Years before, was turned into a Col|lege, or founded as &s;uch by James Ken|nedy, the Son of the Lord Kennedy, by Mary, Daughter of King Robert III. This James Kennedy was a Clergyman of great Fame in tho&s;e Days, and ro&s;e by the Re|putation of his Wi&s;dom, Prudence, and Beneficence to all Mankind, to the high|e&s;t Po&s;ts of Honour in the State and Dig|nity in the Church; for he was Lord Chancellor of Scotland under James II. and Archbi&s;hop of this See of St. Andrew's. He was a great Lover of Learning, and of learned Men; and was the fir&s;t who encouraged Men of Learning from Abroad, to come there and take upon them the governing and in&s;tructing the Youth in the great School, which, as I &s;ay, above, had been there &s;o long, as that it was then called the antient School of St. An|drew. The&s;e learned Men put him upon founding and endowing a College, or rather turning the School into a College or Academy, which he did.</P>
<P>The Building is antient, but appears to have been very magnificent con&s;idering the Times it was erected in, which was 1456. The Gate is large, and has hand|&s;ome Spire over it all of Stone. In the fir&s;t Court, on the Right Side as you go in, is the Chapel of the College, not ex|traordinary large, but &s;ufficient. There is an antient Monument of the Archbi|&s;hop the Founder, who lyes buried in the Church of his own Building. Beyond the Chapel is the Cloi&s;ter, after the antient Manner, not unlike that in Canterbury, but not &s;o large. Oppo&s;ite to this are Offices, and proper Buildings for the ne|ce&s;&s;ary U&s;e of the Colleges. In the &s;econd Court are the Schools of the Col|lege, on the &s;ame Spot where &s;tood the antient Grammar School, mentioned above,
<PB REF="521">
above, if that Part is to be depended up|on Over the&s;e Schools is a very large Hall for the Publick Exerci&s;es, as is u&s;ual in other Univer&s;ities; but this is a mo&s;t &s;pacious Building, and far larger than there is any Occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>In the &s;ome Court are the Aparments for the Ma&s;ters, Profe&s;&s;ors, and Regents, which, (as our Fellows) are in Sallary, and are Tutors and Governors to the &s;e|veral Students; were this College &s;upport|ed by additional Bounties and Donations, as has been the Ca&s;e in England; and were &s;ufficient Funds appointed to repair and keep up the Buildings, there would few Colleges in England go beyond it for Magnificence: But Want of this, and o|ther Encouragements, cau&s;es the whole Building to &s;eem as if it was its declining State, and looking into its Grave: The Truth is, the College wants nothing but $word$ good Fund to be hone&s;tly applyed for $he Repair of the Building&punc; fini&s;hing the $r&s;t De&s;ign, and encouraging the Scholars. $r. Skeen, Principal of this College, &s;hew|$$ the Way to Po&s;terity to do this, and $id out great Sums in Repairs, e&s;pecially $word$ the Churches, and founded a Library $word$ the U&s;e of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>They tell you a Story here of nine $word$ found under the Archbi&s;hop's Tomb, $r the Re&s;toration of King Charles II. to me the Story does not tell well at Fir&s;t, It does not appear of what $word$ or to what Purpo&s;e &s;o many Maces $word$ made and kept there, the like not $word$ known to be us'd in any Cathedral $ollege in other Countries: And in the Place how came they to rummage good Founder's Grave, and that in Charles the IId's Time too; if it $een in Oliver Cromwell's Domina|$ it would have &s;eemed rational to ex|$$t; but after the Re&s;toration to the Monuments of the Dead, is $$ing extraordinary: But be that as it $$ere are three Maces kept in the $word$ whether they were found in the King's Tomb or not, that I leave to Tradition, as I fi$d it. One of the&s;e Maces is of very fine Workman&s;hip, all of Silver, gilt, and very heavy, of fine Imagery, and curious Workman&s;$ip, made at Parts by the Archbi&s;hop's &s;pecial Di|rections, as appears by an In&s;cription on a Plate, fa&s;tened to the Mace by a little Chain, and pre&s;erved with it.</P>
<P>The Story of St. Andrew, and of his Bones being buried here: of the fir&s;t Stone of the Cathedral Church being laid upon one of St. Andrew's Legs or Thig-Bone, and of tho&s;e Bones being brought from Patras in the Morea, near the Gulph of Lepanto; the&s;e Things are too antient, and $ound to much of the Legend for me to meddle with.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd College, which is called St Leonard's&punc; is a Principal, who mu&s;t be a Doctor of Divinity by the Foundation; but the pre&s;ent Church Government in|&s;i&s;ting upon the Parity of the Clergy, are plea&s;ed to di&s;pen&s;e with that Part: There are al&s;o four Pro&s;e&s;&s;ors of Philo&s;ophy, to whom the late Sir John Scot, a bountiful Benefactor to this College, has added a Profe&s;&s;or of Philology, and has &s;ettled a very hand&s;ome Stipend upon the Profe&s;|&s;or: Al&s;o the &s;ame Gentleman augmented the College Library with &s;everal valuable Books to a very con&s;iderable Sum. And &s;ince that Sir John Wedderburn, a Gentle|man of a very antient Family, and a great Lover of Learning, has given a whole Library, being a great and choice Collec|tion of Books, to be added to the Library of this College.</P>
<P>The Revenue of this College is larger than that of the old College; it has al&s;o more Students. It was founded and en|dowed by the Earl of Lenox, being before that a religious Hou&s;e, of the Order of St. Benedict, as appears by the Regi&s;ter and Charter of the Foundation</P>
<P>It is not &s;o large and magnificent as St. Salvador originally was; but 'ts kept in much better Repair. It has but one Court
<PB REF="522">
or Square, but it is very large. The old Building of the Mona&s;tery remains entire, and makes the South &s;ide, and the old Cells of the Monks makes now the Chambers for the Students: The Chapel takes up the North &s;ide, and a large &s;ide of more Modern Apartments on the We&s;t, which are neverthele&s;s old enough to be falling down; but they are now repairing them, and adding a great Pile of Building to compleat the Square, and join that &s;ide to the North where the Chapel &s;tands.</P>
<P>This College has large Yards, as they call them, that is to &s;ay Gardens, or ra|ther Orchards, well planted, and good Walks in them as well as good F$$$t.</P>
<P>This College has many Benefactors, which make it flouri&s;h much beyond the fir&s;t; and they talk of a large Gift yet to come from a noble Family, which, if it falls, will enable them to put the whole Hou&s;e in compleat Repair.</P>
<P>The New College, called St. Mary's, was founded by Cardinal Beaton, Arch|bi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, and is very &s;in|gular in its re&s;erv'd and limited Laws. Here ate no Scholars at all; but all tho&s;e Scholars who have pa&s;s'd their fir&s;t Studies, and gone through a Cour&s;e of Philo&s;o|phy in any of the other Colleges, may enter them&s;elves here to &s;tudy Hebrew and the Mathematicks, Hi&s;tory, or other Parts of Science.</P>
<P>It was in this College King Charles I. held a Parliament; the Place is called the Parliament Room to this Day, and is a very large, &s;pacious Room, able to receive 4000 People, placed on Seats to &s;it down; the Form is re&s;erv'd very plain, and the Place, where the Tables for the Clarks and other Offices were &s;et, is to be &s;een.</P>
<P>There is a Library al&s;o to this College, but not very valuable, or &s;o well furni&s;h'd as that of St. Leonard's. Here are, how|ever, two Profe&s;&s;ors of Divinity; one is called the principal Profe&s;&s;or of Theo|logy, and the other barely the Pro&s;e $or of Theology: To the&s;e was afterwards added a Profe&s;&s;or of the Mathematicks; and he that was the fir&s;t who enjoyed the Place, viz. Dr. Gregory, obtained an Ob&s;ervatory to be erected, and gave them abundance of Mathematical and A&s;trono|mical in&s;truments: But it is not now made U&s;e of, for what Rea&s;on I kn$w not.</P>
<P>In the New Church in this City lies the Body of the late Archbi&s;hop Sharp, who was A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated upon a Moor or Heath, as he was coming in his Coach home to this City from the Court. There is a fine Monument of Marble over his Grave, with his Statue kneeling on the upper Part, and the Manner of his Mur|der is cut in Ba&s;s Relief below. This Murder is Matter of Hi&s;tory, but is &s;o fooli&s;hly, or &s;o partial$y, or &s;o imperfect|ly related by all that have yet written of it, that Po&s;terity will loo&s;e both the Fact and the Cau&s;e of it in a few Years more. It would require too large a &s;pace in this Work to give a fre&s;h and impartial Ac|count of it, and for that Rea&s;on I cannot enter upon it, though I have the mo&s;t exact Account that, I believe, is left in the World, which I had from the Mouth of one of the Actors, and have &s;ince had it confirmed from &s;everal others, thoroughly acquainted with the Particu|lars of it</P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ay here, that the Arch|bi&s;hop had been a furious and mercile&s;s Per&s;ecutor, and, indeed, Murderer of ma|ny of the innocent People, merely for their keeping up their Field-Meetings, and was charg'd in particular with two Ac|tions; which, if true will, though not ju&s;tify, yet take off much of the black Part, which the very Murder it&s;elf leaves on the Memory of the Actors.</P>

<P N="2">2. The Shipping 200 poor Men on board a Ve&s;&s;el, on pretence of Tran|&s;portation to the Engli&s;h Colonies in the We&s;t Indies; but ordering the Ship to be run on &s;hore and lo&s;t. I &s;ay it is &s;aid to be ordered, and generally &s;o believed, becau&s;e, when the Ship was bulg'd upon the Rocks, the Ma&s;ter and Seamen, and the Officers, appointed to confine the bani&s;h'd People, all got on Shore, bat lock'd all the re&s;t down under the Hatch$s, and would not &s;uffer one of them to come out, by which Means they every one peri&s;h'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Things they charg'd di|$ectly on the Archbi&s;hop, be&s;ides many other Cruelties, which they call Murders; and if they were acted, as is related by others as well as they, I mu&s;t acknow|ledge they could be no other.</P>
<P>Now 'tis as certain that the&s;e Men $word$ nothing of meeting with the Arch-Bi&s;hop at that Time; but being them|&s;elves Out&punc;law'd Men, whom any Man, $$at met might kill, and who (it taken) $word$ have been put to Death: They $lways went arm'd&punc; and were, at that $$ne, looking for another Man, when $nexpectedly they &s;aw the Bi&s;hop $word$ towards them in his Coach, when one $word$ them &s;ays to the other, we have not $word$ the Per&s;on we look'd for; but $o, $word$ h$s delivered our Enemy, and the $$derer of our Bre$hren into our Hands, $ain&s;t whom we cannot obtain Ju&s;tice $ the Law, which is perverted: But member the Words of the Text, <HI>I&s; ye let him go, thy Life &s;hall be required for his Life.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, they immediately re&s;olv'd to fall upon him, and cut him in Pieces; I &s;ay they re&s;olved, all but one, (viz.) Hack&s;ton of Rathellet, who was not wil|ling to have his Hand in the Blood, though he acknowledg'd he de&s;erv'd to die: So that when they attack'd the Bi&s;hop. Hack|&s;ton went off, and &s;tood at a Di&s;tance&punc; Nor did he hold their Hor&s;es, as one has ignorantly publi&s;h'd; for they at|tack'd him all mounted, nor could they well have &s;topp'd a Coach and $ix Hoa|&s;es, if they had been on Foot. I men|tion this Part, becau&s;e, however Provi|dence order'd it, &s;o it was, that none of the Murderers ever fell into the hands of Ju&s;tice, but this Hack&s;ton of Rathellet, who was mo&s;t cruelly tortur'd, and af|terwards had his hands cut off, and was then executed at Edinburgh.</P>
<P>I have not Time to give the re&s;t of this Story, though the Particulars are very well worth relating, but it is re|mote from my Purpo&s;e, and I mu&s;t pro|ceed The City of St. Andrew's is, nor|with&s;tanding its many Di&s;a&s;teis; &s;uch as th Ruin of the great Church&punc; the demo|li&s;hing its Ca&s;tle, and the Archbi&s;hop's Palace, and Oliver Cromwel$'s Citadel; yet, I &s;ay, it is &s;till a hand&s;ome City, and well built, the Streets &s;traight and large, being three Streets paralled to one another, all opening to the Sea.</P>

<P>From Perth I went South to that Part of the Province of Fife, which they call Clackmanan, lying We&s;t from Dumferm|ling, and extending it&s;elf towards Ster|ling and Dumblain, all which Part I had not gone over before, and which was an|tiently accounted to be Part of Fife.</P>
<P>From Perth to Sterling there lyes a Vale which they call Strathmore, and which is a fine level Country, though &s;ur|rounded with Hills, and is e&s;teem'd the mo&s;t fruitful in Corn of all that Part of the Country: It lies extended on both Sides the Tay, and is &s;aid to reach o B$echen North Ea&s;t, and almo&s;t to Ster|ling South We&s;t. Here are, as in all &s;uch plea&s;ant Soils you will find, a great many Gentlemen's Seats; though on the North Side of the Tay, and here in parti|cular is the noble Palace of Glames, the Hereditary Seat of the Family of Lyon, Earls of Strathmore; and as the Heir in Rever&s;ion now enjoys the Title and E&s;tate, &s;o it very narrowly e&s;cap d being forfeited; for the elder Brother Earl of Strathmore, having entertein'd the Pre|tender magnificently in this fine Palace, and join'd his forces in Per&s;on, and with all his Intere&s;t, lo&s;t his Life in that Ser|vice, being kill'd at the Battle of Sheriff-Moor, by his fall, the E&s;tate being en|tail'd, de&s;cended to the &s;econd Son, or younger Brother, who is now Earl of Strathmore&punc;</P>
<P>Glames is, indeed, one of the fine&s;t old built Palaces in Scotland, and by far the large&s;t; and this makes me &s;peak of it here, becau&s;e I am naming the Pre|tender and his Affairs, though a little out of Place; when you &s;ee it at a Di&s;tance is &s;o full of Turtets and lofty Buildings, Spires and Towers&punc; &s;ome $$ain others &s;hining with gilded Tops, that it looks not like a Town, but a City; lard the nFble Appearance &s;een through $word$ Vi&s;ta's of the Park are &s;o differing, that it does not appear like the &s;ame $word$ any two Ways together.</P>
<P>The great Aveuue is a full halt Mile, planted, on either &s;ide with &s;everal $word$ of Trees; when you come to the $word$ Gate you are &s;urprized with the Beauty and the Variety of the Statues, Bu&s;ts, &s;ome of Bra&s;s, &s;ome gilded, &s;ome plain. $word$ he Statues in Bra&s;s are four, one of King James VI. one of King Charles I. $word$ and &s;purr'd, as if going to take $word$ at the head of his Army; one of Charles II. and one of King James VII after $he Pattern of that at Whitehall.</P>
<P>When the Pretender lodg'd here, $er the Earl of Strathmore entertained him in his fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;age to Perth with great Magnificence: There were told three and forty furni&s;h'd Rooms on the fir&s;t Floor of the Aou&s;e; fome Beds, perhaps, were put up for the Occa&s;ion, for they m$de Eighty-eight Beds for them, and the $word$ Retinue of the Pretender was $word$ the Hou&s;e being able to receive the Coat of a real reigning Prince,</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to go about $word$ de&s;cribe the magnificent Furniture, the Family Pictures, the Gallery, the fine Collection of Original Paintings, and the noble painted Cielings of the Chape$, which is an Organ for the Service after the Manner of the Church of England. In a Word, the Hou&s;e is as n$bly fur|ni&s;h'd as mo&s;t Palaces in Scotland&punc; $word$ as I &s;aid it was at the brink of $word$ for had the Earl not been $word$ 'tis Odds but it had been gutted by the

Army, which pre&s;ently &s;pread all the Country; but it was enough, the Earl lo&s;t his Life, and the pre&s;ent Earl enjoys it peaceably.</P>
<P>From hence I came away South We&s;t, and cro&s;&s;ing the Tay below Perth, but above Dundee, came to Dumblain, a Name made famous by the late Battle fought between the Army of King George, un|der the Command of the Duke of Argyle, and the Pretender's Forces under the Earl of Marr, which was fought on Sheriff-Moor, between Sterling and Dumblain: The Town is plea&s;antly &s;ituated, and to|lerably well built, but out of all Man|ner of Trade; &s;o that there is neither pre&s;ent Pro&s;perity upon it, or Pro&s;pect of future.</P>
<P>Going from hence we took a full View of the Field of Battle, call'd Sheriff-Mui$, and had Time to contemplate how it was po&s;&s;ible, that a Rabble of Highland|ers, arm'd in ha&s;te&punc; appearing in Rebel|lion, headed by a Per&s;on never in Arms before, nor of the lea&s;t Experience, &s;hould come &s;o near to the overthrowing an Army of regular di&s;ciplin'd Troops, and led on by experinced Officers, and &s;o great a General: But when the Mi&s;take appear'd al&s;o, we ble&s;s'd the good Protec|tor of Great Britain, who, under a Piece of the Mi&s;taken Conduct in the World, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, gave that impor|tant Victory to King George's Troops, and prevented the Ruin of Scotland from an Army of Highlanders.</P>
<P>From this Place of Reflection I came forward in Sight of Sterling Bridge, but leaving it on the Right Hand, turn'd away Ea&s;t to Alloway, where the Earl of Ma$r has a noble Seat, I &s;hould have &s;aid had a noble Seat, and where the Navigation of the Firth of Forth begins. This is, as I hinted before, within four Miles of Sterling by $and, and $carcely within twenty by Water, occa&s;ion'd by tho&s;e $ncommon Meanders and Reaches in the River, which gives &s;o beautiful a Pro&s;|pect from the Ca&s;tle of Sterling.</P>
<P>This fine Seat was formerly call'd the Ca|&s;tle of Alloway, but is now &s;o beautify'd, the Buildings, and e&s;pecially the Gardens, &s;o compleat and completely modern, that no appearance of a Ca&s;tle can be &s;aid to remain&punc; There is a Harbour for Shipping, and Ships of Burthen may come &s;afely up to it: And this is the Place where the Gla&s;|gow Merchants are, as I am told, erecting Magazines or Warehou&s;es, to which they propo&s;e to bring their Tobacco and Sugars by Land, and then to &s;hip them for Hol|land or Hamburgh, or the Baltick, or England, as they find Opportuni y, or a Market; and I doubt not but they will find thetr Advantage in it.</P>
<P>The Ga$deus of Alloway Hou&s;e, in|deed&punc; well de&s;erve a De&s;cription; they are by much, the fine&s;t in Scotland, and not outdone by many in England; the Gardens, &s;ingly de&s;crib'd, take up above forty Acres of Ground, and the adjoin|ing Wood, which is adapted to the Hou&s;e in Avenues and Vi&s;ta's, above three times as much.</P>
<P>It would be le&s;&s;ening the Place to at|tem the De&s;cription, unle&s;s I had Room to do it compleatly; 'tis enough to lay it requires a Book, not a Page or two: There is, in a Word, every Thing that Nature and Art can do, brought to Per|fection.</P>
<P>The Town is plea&s;ant, well built, and full of Trade; for the whole Country has &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s or other with them, and they have a better Navigation than mo&s;t of the Towns on the Firth, for a Ship of Three Hundred Ton may lye allo at the very Wharf; &s;o that at Al|loway a Merchant may trade to all Parts of the World, as well as at Leith or at Gla&s;gow.</P>
<P>The High Street of Alloway reaches down to this Harbour, and is a very &s;pacious

well built Streets, with Rows of Trees finely planted all the Way. Here are &s;everal Te&s;timonies of the Goodne&s;s of their Trade, as particularly a lage Deal-Yard, or Place for laying up all Sorts of Norway Goods, which &s;hews they have a Commerce thither. The have large Warehou&s;es of Naval Stores; &s;uch as Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax, two Saw Mills for cutting or &s;litting of Deals, and a Rope-Walk for making all Sorts of Ropes and Cables for Rigging and fitting of Ships, with &s;everal other Things, which con|vinces us they are no Strangers to other Trad s, as well by Sea as by Land.</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange Te&s;timony of the Power of Envy and Ambition, that Mankind, ble&s;s'd with &s;uch Advantages, for an ea&s;y and happy Retreat in the World, &s;hould hazard it all in Faction and Party, and throw it all away in View, and even with|out a View of getting more: But I mu&s;t not phylo&s;opihze, any more than launch out into other Exce&s;&s;es; my Bu&s;ine&s;s is with the pre&s;ent State of the Place, and to that I confine my&s;elf as near as I can</P>
<P>From Alloway, Ea&s;t, the Country is called the Shire of Clackmannan, and is known for yielding the be&s;t of Coal, and the greate&s;t Quantity of it of any Coun|try in Scotland; &s;o that it is carryed, not to Edinburgh only, but to England, to Holland, and to France; and they tell us of new Pits, or Mines of of Coal now di&s;cover'd, which will yield &s;uch Quanti|ties, and &s;o ea&s;y to come at, as are never to be exhau&s;ted; tho' &s;uch great Quan|tities &s;hould be &s;ent to England, as the York Buildings Company boa&s;t of, name|ly, twenty Thou&s;and Ton a Year; which, hower, I take it as it is, for a Boa&s;t, or or rather a Pretence to per&s;uade the World they have a Demand for &s;uch a Quantity; whereas, while the Freight from Scotland is, as we know, &s;o dear, and the Tax in England continues &s;o heavy, the Price of the&s;e Coals will always be &s;o high at Lon|don, as will not fail to re&s;train the Con|&s;umption; nor is it the Intere&s;t of Scot|land to &s;end away &s;o great a Quantity of Coal as &s;hall either make a Scarcity, or rai&s;e the Price of them at Home.</P>
<P>On this Shore of the Firth, farther down, &s;tands the Town Culro&s;s a neat and agreeable Town, lying in length by the Water Side, like Kirkcaldy, and be|ing likewi&s;e a Trading Town, as Trade mu&s;t be under&s;tood in Scotland. Here is a pretty Market, a plentiful Country be|hind it, and the navigable Firth before it; the Coal and the Linnen Manufacture, and Plenty of Corn&punc; &s;uch Exportations will always keep &s;omething of Trade a|live upon this whole Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Here is a very noble Seat belonging to the Bruces, Earls of Kincairn, and is worth De&s;cription; but that I have named &s;o many fine Hou&s;es, and have yet &s;o many to go over before I go through the whole Tour of Scotland, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to give every fine Hou&s;e a Place here, nor would it do any thing but t$re the Reader, rather than inform him; as I have done therefore in England I mu&s;t be content to name them, unle&s;s I &s;hould make my Jour|ney a meer Vi&s;it to great Hou&s;es, as $f Scotland had nothing el&s;e worth No|tice.</P>
<P>This Calling at Culro&s;s, called vulgar|ly Cooris, fini&s;hes my Ob&s;ervations upon the Province of Fife. They told me of Mines of Copper, and of Lead, $word$ di&s;cover'd in Fi&s;e, and of Silver al&s;o. But I could not learn that any of them were actually wrought, or, as they ca$$ it in Darby&s;hire, at work. It is, how|ever, not improbable but that there are &s;uch Mines, the Country &s;eeming very likely for it by many Particular Tokens.</P>
<P>The two Lomons in this Province are two remarkable Mountains, which parti|cularly &s;eem to promi&s;e Metal in their Bowels, if they were thoroughly &s;earch'd. They ri&s;e up like two Sugar-Loaves in the Middle of a plain Country, not far f om Falkland, and give a View of the Firth of

Edinburge South, and the $irth of Tay North, and are &s;een from Edinburgh very $ain.</P>
<P>Having made this little Excur&s;ion to the South from Perth, you may &s;uppo&s;e me now returned Northward again; and having given you my Account of Perth, and its pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, I now pro|ceed that Way, taking Things as well in their ordinary Situation as I can; we could not be at Perth and not have a De|&s;i$e to &s;ee that antient Seat of Royal Ce|remony, for the Scots Kings, I mean of Scone, where all the Kings of Scotland were crowned.</P>
<P>Scone lyes on the other Side of the Tay, about a Mile North We&s;t from Perth; it was famous for the old Chair in which the Kings of Scotland were crown'd, and which Edw. I. King of England, having pierced through the whole Kingdom, and nothing being able to with&s;tand him, brought away with him. It is now de|po&s;ited in We&s;tmin&s;ter&punc; and the Kings of Scotland are &s;till crowned in it, according to an old Scots Prophecy, which they &s;ay, Mark it. I do but tell you They &s;ay &s;o, was cut in Stone, which is enclo&s;ed in the lower Parth of the wooden Chair in which the Kings are crown'd.</P>
<Q><L>Ni fallat fatum, Scoti quocunque $o|catum.</L>
<L>Inveniu$t Lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.</L></Q>
<P>Engli&s;hed thus;
<Q><L>Or Fates deceived, and Heaven de|crees in vain,</L>
<L>Or where this Stone is found, the Scots &s;hall reign.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Palace was in tho&s;e Days a great Mona&s;tery, and famous on Occa&s;ion of this S one in the Chair; the Monks ap|propria$ing to them&s;elves not the Cu&s;tom only, but the Right of having all the Kings crowned on it, as if it had been a &s;acred Right, and in&s;tituted in Heaven: and that the Kings would not pro&s;per if they were crowned any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>Proce&s;s of Time rais'd it from a Mona|&s;tery to a Royal Palace, in Honour of the Ceremony, and of King Kenneth, who, having fought a bloody Battle there with the Picts, and given them a great Over|throw, &s;at down to re&s;t him upon this Stone, after he had been tired with the Slaughter of the Enemy, upon which his Nobles came round about h m to congra|tulate his Succe&s;s&punc; and, in Honour to his Valour, crowned him with a Garland of Victory; a$ter which he dedicated the Stone to the Ceremony, and appointed, that all the Kings of Scotland &s;hould be crowned, &s;itting upon it as he had done&punc; and that then they &s;hould be victorious over all their Enemies.</P>
<P>But enough of Fable&punc; for this, I &s;up|po&s;e, to be no other; yet, be it how it will, this is no Fable, that here all the Kings of Scotland were Crown'd and all the Kingi have been &s;ince crowned on it, or in the Chair, or near it ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The Palace of Scoon, though antient, is not &s;o much decayed as tho&s;e I have al+ready &s;poken of; and the Pretender found it very well in Repair for his U&s;e: Here he lived and kept his Court, a fatal Court to the Nobility and Gentry of Scotland, who were deluded to appear for him; here I &s;ay, he kept his Court in all the State and Appearance of a Sovereign, and re|ceived Honours as &s;uch; &s;o that he might &s;ay he reign'd in Scotland, though not over Scotland, for a few Days: But it was but a few (about twenty) till he and all his Adherents were oblig'd to quit, not the Place only, but the I&s;land&punc; and that without fighting, though the Roy|al Army was not above Ten Thou&s;and Men.</P>
<P>The Building is very large, the Front above 200 Foot in Breadth, and has two ex raordinary fine &s;quare Courts, be&s;ides
<PB REF="530">
others, which contain the Offices, Out|hou&s;es, &amp;c. The Royal Apartments are &s;pacious and large, but the Building the Wain&s;cotting, the Chimney-Pieces, &amp;c. all after the old Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Among the Pictures there, the Pre|tender had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee his Mother's Picture, an Original, done in Italy, when &s;he was Prince&s;s of Modena only, and was marry'd by Proxy, in the Name of King James VII then Duke of York, repre&s;ented by the Earl of Peter|borough Here is the longe&s;t Gallery in Scotland, and the Cieling Painted, but the Painting exceeding old.</P>
<P>From Scoon to Dunkel is &s;o little a Way we de&s;ired to &s;ee it, being the Place where the fir&s;t Skirmi&s;h was fought be|tween the Forces of King William, af|ter the Revolution, and the Laird of Claverhou&s;e, after called Vi&s;count Dun|dee, and where the brave Lieutenant-Colonel Cleeland was kill'd: But Dundee's Men, tho' 5000, were gallantly repuls'd by a Handful, even of new rais'd Men.</P>
<P>The Duke of A$hol has an old Hou&s;e, here, and it was in one of the Courts of that Hou&s;e that Part of the Action was; and the Gentleman above-named was &s;hot from out of a Window, as he was ordering and encouraging his Men; we were almo&s;t tempted to go on this Way&punc; to &s;ee the Field of Battle, be|tween the &s;ame Dundee and the great Lieutenant General Mac-Kay, wherein the latter, though with regular Troops, was really defeated by the Highlanders: But Dundee being kill'd by an acciden|tal Shot after the Fight, they could not improve the Victory, and the Re&s;i&s;tance ended &s;oon after; whereas, indeed, had not that Accident happened, Dundee, who was a bold enterpri&s;ing Man, had cer|tainly march'd Southward, and bid fair to have given King William a Journey into the North, in&s;tead of a Voyage to Ireland; but Providence had better Things in &s;tore for Great Britain.</P>
<P>But our determin'd Rout lay up the Ea&s;tern Shore, and through the Sh $res, adjacent on that &s;ide, as particularly An|gus, Mearns, Marr, Aberdeen, Buchan or Bucquhan, &amp;c. So as I laid out before to Inverne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden tells us, that the Firth of Tay was the utmo&s;t Bounds of the Roman Empire in Britain. That Julius Agricola, the be&s;t of Generals under the wor&s;t of Emperor's, Domitian, though he pierc'd farther, and travers'd by Laud into the Heart of the Highlands, yet &s;ee|ing no End of the barbarou&punc;Country, and no Advantage by the Conque&s;t of a few Barbarian Mountaineers, withdrew and fix'd the Roman Eagles here; that he frequently harra&s;s'd the Picts by Excur|&s;ions and Inroads, and de&s;troy'd the Coun|try, laying it wa&s;te, to &s;tarve them out of the fertile&s;t Part of it, but always re|turn'd to his Po&s;t, making the Tay his Frontier.</P>
<P>But our Engli&s;h Cae&s;ars have outgone the Romans; for Edward I. as is &s;aid, pa&s;s'd the Tay, for he rifled the Abb$y at Scoon; and, if we may believe Hi|&s;tory, penetrated into the remote&s;t Parts, which, however, I take to be only the remote&s;t Parts of what was then known to the Engli&s;h; for as to the Highlands, the Mountains of Loquhaber, Bo&s;s, Mur|ray, Sutherland, and Caithne&s;s, we read nothing of them: And from the&s;e Re|treats the Scots always return'd, Antaeus like, with double Strength after every Defeat, till in the next Reign they over|threw his Succe&s;&s;or Edward II. at Ban|nockbourn, and drove the Engli&s;h out of the whole Country; nay, and follow'd them over Tweed into England, ravag|ing the Countries of Northumberland and Cumberland, and paying them in the$$ own kind with Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Oliver Cromwell indeed (according to the Motto of a noble Hou&s;e in Scot|land, (viz) Ride Through) Rode Through; he penettated to the remote&s;t Part of&punc;
<PB REF="531">
the I&s;land, and that he might rule them with a Rod of Iron in the very Letter of it, he built Citadels and Forts in all the Angeli and Extremes, where he found it needful to place his &s;tationary Legions, ju&s;t as the Romans did; as at Leith, at St. Andrews, at Inverne&s;s, Irwin, Inner|lochy, and &s;everal other Places: And ju&s;t now we find King George's Forces marching to the remote&s;t Corners, nay, ferrying over into the We&s;tern, and North-We&s;tern I&s;lands; but then this is not as a Foreigner and Conqueror, but as a So|vereign, a lawful Governor and Father of the Country, to deliver from, not en|tangle her in the Chains of Tyranny and U&s;urpation.</P>
<P>But where Armies have march'd, private Travellers may certainly pa&s;s, and with that A&s;&s;ufance we chearfully pa&s;s'd the Tay tru&s;ting very much to that natural, known Civility, which the Scots, in the remote&s;t Parts, always &s;hew to Stran|gers.</P>
<P>We left Strathern therefore, with the little Country of Menteith, for our Re|turn, and went down into Angus, on the Northern Banks of Tay to Dundee, a plea&s;ant, large, populous City, and well de&s;erves the Title of Bonny Dundee, &s;o often given it in Di&s;cour&s;e, as well as in Song (Bonny in Scots, &s;ignifying Beau|tiful).</P>
<P>As it &s;tands well for Trade, &s;o it is one of the be&s;t trading Towns in Scot|land, and that as well in foreign Bu&s;ine&s;s as in Manufacture and Home Trade. It has but an indifferent Harbour, but the Tay is a large, &s;afe, and good Road, and there is a deep Water, and very good An|chor-Hold almo&s;t all over it.</P>
<P>It is exceedingly populous, full of &s;tate|ly Hou&s;es, and large hand&s;ome Streets; particularly it has four very good Streets, with a large Market place in the Middle, the large&s;t and faire&s;t in Scotland, except only that of Aberdeen. The Tolbooth, or Town-Hall is an old, but large and convenient Building.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants here appear like Gen|tlemen, as well as Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and yet are real Merchants too, and make good what we &s;ee &s;o eminently in Eng|land, That true bred Merchants are the be&s;t of Gentlemen. They have a very good and large Corre&s;pondence here with England, and &s;hip off a great Deal of Lin|nen thither, al&s;o a great Quantity of Corn is &s;ent from hence, as well to Eng|land as to Holland. They have likewi&s;e a good Share of the Norway Trade; and as they ar concern'd in the Herring Fi&s;hery, they con&s;equently have &s;ome Ea&s;t Coun|try Trade&punc; viz. to Dantzick, Konings|berg, Riga, and the neighbouring Parts. They &s;end Ships al&s;o to Sweden, and import Iron, Coppor, Tar, Pitch, Deals, &amp;c. from the &s;everal trading Ports of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal Trades occa&s;ion a Con|cour&s;e of Shipping at the Port; and there are not a few Ships belonging to the Place. The Country behind them call'd the Car&s;e, or the Car&s;e of Gowry, with tht Vale mention'd above of Str$thmoor; for Strath, in their Dialect, &s;ignifies a Vale, or level Country; I &s;ay, all that Country abounds in Corn, and the Poon, of Dundee &s;hips off great Quan$ilt the when a plentiful Crop allows it, tof the great Advantage of the Gentlement, is well as Farmers; for as the Gentler, or receive all their Rents in Kind, these, would find a great Difficulty &s;ometimes&punc; to di&s;po&s;e of it, if the Merchant here did not &s;hip it off, either for London or Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>The Town of Dundee &s;tands at a little Di&s;tance from the Tay, but they are join'd by a Cau&s;eway or Walk, well pav'd with &s;lat Free &s;tone, &s;uch as the Side-ways in Cheap&s;ide and Cornhill, and Rows of Trees
<PB REF="532">
are planted on either Side the Walk, which makes it very agreeable. On one Part of this Walk are very good Warehou&s;es for Merchandi&s;es, e&s;pecially for heavy Goods; and al&s;o Granaries for Corn, of which &s;ometimes they have a va&s;t Quantity laid up here; and the&s;e being near the Har|bour are convenient, as well for the hou&s;|ing of Goods, when landed, as for the ea&s;y &s;hipping off what lies for Exporta|tion.</P>
<P>The great Church was formerly colle|giate, being the Cathedral of the Place, and was a very large Building; but Part of i$ was demoli&s;hed in the Civil War; the Remainder is devided, like as others are at Edinburgh, Gla&s;gow, &amp;c. into three Churches for the pre&s;ent U&s;e of the Citizens.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a Meeting hou&s;e or two for the Epi&s;copal Wor&s;hip: for you are to take it once for all, that North by Tay, there are far more of the Epi&s;copal Per|&s;wa&s;ion than are to be found in the South; and the farther North, the more &s;o, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its Order.</P>
<P>The Tower upon the great Church here is a hand&s;ome &s;quare Building, large, and antient, but very high, and is a good Ornament to the City; it re&s;embles the great Tower upon the Cathedral of Can|terbury, but not quite &s;o high. There tw$$ne and well endow'd Ho&s;pital for Li$y'd Town&s;men of Dundee, where thy are well taken Care of, and provid|$$ for. The Pretender was in this City $oon after his Landing, and &s;taid here &s;ome Time before he advanced to Scoon; the Laird of Claverhou&s;e of the Name of Graham, who was killed&punc; as has been &s;aid, at the Battle of Gill$$ran$$y, was made Vi&s;count of Dundee by King James VII; but enjoyed it not long. His Seat of Claverhou&s;e is not far off, and he had the E&s;tate annexed to the Con&s;ultulary of Dundee, given him with the Title, but 'tis now in the Duke of Dougl$&s;s.</P>
<P>It is twenty Scots Miles from $word$ to Montro&s;e, the Way plea&s;ant, the $word$ fruitful and be&s;pangled, as the $span$ a clear Night with Stars of the big+ge&s;t Magnitude, with Gentlemens Hou&s;e$ thick as they can be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand with Plea&s;ure and Conveniency. Among the&s;e is the noble Palace of Penmure forfeited in the late Rebellion by the un+fortunate Earl of Penmure, who was him &s;elf wounded in the Fight near $word$ and with that Action ruined a noble and antient Family, and a fine E&s;tate. The Surname of the Family is Maul and Mau$s|burgh, a &s;mall Port near Montro&s;s, bea$, the Name &s;till to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The Town and Port of Montro&s;e, val|garly, but ignorantly, called Montro&s;s, was our next Stage, &s;tanding upon the Ea&s;tmo&s;t Shore of Angus, open to the German, or, if you plea&s;e now, the Ca|ledonian Ocean, and at the Mouth or the little River South Esk, which makes the Harbour.</P>
<P>We did not find &s;o kind a Reception among the common People of Angus, and the other Shires on this Side the Country, as the Scots u&s;ually give to Strangers&punc; But we found it was becau&s;e we were Eng|li&s;h Men; and we found that their Aver|&s;ion did $ot lye &s;o much again&s;t us on Account of the late Succe&s;&s;es at, and after the Rebellion, and the Forf$itur $word$ the many Noblemen and Gentlemen's E&s;tates among them as fell on that Occa+&s;ion, though that might add to the Di&s;|gu&s;t: But it was on Account of the Uni|on, which they almo&s;t univer&s;ally ex|claimed again&s;t, tho' &s;ometimes again&s;t all manner of ju&s;t Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>This Town of Montro&s;e is a Sea port, and, in Proportion to its Number of In|habitants, a con&s;iderable Trade, and i$ tolerably well built, and capable of being made &s;trong, only that it extends too far in Length.</P>
<P>The French Fleet fir&s;t made Land at this Port, when they had the Pretender
<PB REF="533">
on Board, in the Reign of Queen Ann; having over&s;hot the Mouth of the Firth &s;o far, whither they had fir&s;t de&s;igned: But this Mi&s;take, which &s;ome thought a Misfortune, was certainly a Deliverance to them; for as this mi&s;take gave Time to the Engli&s;h Fleet to come up with them, before they could enter the Firth, &s;o it left them Time and Room al&s;o to make their E&s;cape, which, if they had been gone up the Firth, they could never have done, but mu&s;t inevitably have been all burnt and de&s;troyed, or taken by the Briti&s;h Fleet under Sir George Bing, which was &s;uperior to them in Force.</P>
<P>From Montro&s;e the Shore lies due North to Aberdeen: By the Way is the Ca&s;tle of Dunnoter, a &s;trong Fortificati|on, upon a high Precipice of a Rock, looking down on the Sea as on a Thing infinitely below it. The Ca&s;tle is walled about with invincible Walls, &s;aid the hone&s;t Scots Man that &s;hewed us the Road to it, having Towers at proper Di&s;tances, after the old Way of fortifying Towns.</P>
<P>This was chiefly made u&s;e of as a Pri|&s;on for State-Pri&s;oners; and I have &s;een a black Account of the cruel U&s;age the unhappy Pri&s;oners have met with there; but tho&s;e Times are over with Scotland. The Earl Mar&s;hal, of the Name of Keith, was the Lord of this Ca&s;tle, as al&s;o of a $word$ Hou&s;e near it, but not a great E&s;tate, and what he had is now gone; for being in the late Rebellion his E&s;tate is forfeit|ed; and we are told his Lord&s;hip, mak|ing his E&s;cape, is now in the Service of Spain, where he commands an Iri&s;h Re|g$ment of Foot.</P>
<P>From hence there is nothing remarkable till we come to Aberdeen, a Place &s;o emi|nent, that it commands &s;ome Stay upon $t yet, I &s;hall contract its De&s;cription as much as po&s;&s;ible, the Compa&s;s of my Work being &s;o great, and the Room, I have for it &s;o &s;mall.</P>
<P>Aberdeen is divided into two Towns or Cities, and &s;tands at the Mouth of two Rivers; the Towns are the New and the Old Aberdeen, about a Mile di&s;tant from one another, one &s;ituate on the River Don or Dune, the other on the River Dec, from whence it is &s;uppo&s;ed to take its Name; for Aber, in the old Briti&s;h Lan|guage, &s;ignifies a Mouth, or Opening of a River, the &s;ame which in Scotland is under&s;tood by a Frith or Firth: So that both the&s;e Towns are de&s;cribed in the Name, (viz) Aberdee, the Mouth of the River Dee, and Aberdeen, the Mouth of the River Don. So in the South-We&s;t Part of the Shores of Britain, and in Wales, we have Aberconway, the M uth of the River Conway, Aberi&s;twith, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>The Old Aberdeen, on the Bank of the Don, mu&s;t, without doubt, be very anti|ent; for they tell us the New Aberdeen is &s;uppo&s;ed to be upwards of 1200 Years old. Nor do any of their Regi&s;ters tell us the particular Time of its being built, or by whom. The Cities are equally &s;i|tuated for Trade, being upon the very Edge of the Sea; and 'tis the common Opinion, th t Part of the old City was wa&s;h'd down by the Sea; &s;o that it oblig|ed the Citzens to build farther off: This Part was that they called the Mona&s;tery, and this may give Ri&s;e to that Opinion, that thereupon they went and built the New Aberdeen upon the $ank of the other River, and which 'tis evident, is built upon a Piece of hilly Ground, or upon three Hills: But this is all Conjecture, and has only Probability to &s;upport it, not any thing of Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Old Aberdeen is al&s;o on one Side the County, and New Aberdeen on another, though both in that which is called in general the County of Marr. The Ex|traordinaries of Aberdeen, take both the Cities together, are

<P N="1">1. The Cathedral dedicated to St. Ma|char, tho' none knows who that Saint was, is a large and ancient Building; the Building maje&s;tick, rather than curious, and yet not without its Beauty in Architecture; it appears to have been built at &s;e|veral Times&punc; and perhaps, at the Di|&s;tance of many Years, one Part from another. The Columns on which the great Steeple &s;tands are very artful, and the Contrivance &s;hews great Judgment in the Builder or Director of the Work. This Church has been divided into &s;everal Parts &s;ince the aboli&s;hing of Epi&s;copacy, as a Government in the Church; (for it is not aboli&s;hed in Aberdeen, as a Principle, to this Day) abundance of the People are &s;till Epi&s;copal in their Opinion; and they have, by the gentle Government they live under, &s;o much Liberty &s;till, as that they have a Chapel for the public Exerci&s;e of their Wor&s;hip, after the Manner of the Church of England, be&s;ides &s;everal Meetings for the E|pi&s;copal Di&s;&s;enters, which are not &s;o Publick.</P>
<P N="2">2. The two Colleges; one of the&s;e are in the Old City, and the other in the New. 1.

The Steeple of this Church was the mo&s;t artificial that I have &s;een in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and very beautiful, ac|cording to the Draught of its Old Building: But it is much more &s;o now having been injur'd, if not quite bro|ken down by a furious Tem$e&s;t <HI>An$$</HI> 1361; but rebuilt after the fir&s;t Mo|del by the Care, and at the Expence of the Bi&s;hop Dr. <HI>Forbes,</HI> as al&s;o of Dr. <HI>Gordon,</HI> M.

<P>King James IV was the Patron of this College, but its Settlement was from Pope Alexander VI. with large Privileges, equal to that of Paris and of Bonania, the Bull for which is &s;till extant; and from this, that King thus e&s;pou&s;ing the Hou&s;e, it obtain'd the Name of King's Colle$$&punc; though the Bi&s;hop was the Founder&punc; as is &s;aid above.</P>

<P N="3">3. The third Article is the great Market place, which, indeed, is very beautiful and &s;pacious; and the Streets adjoining are very hand&s;ome and well-built, the Hou|&s;es lofty and high; but not &s;o as to be inconvenient, as in Edin|burgh; or low, to be contempti|ble, as in mo&s;t other Places. But the Generality of the Citizens Hou&s;es are built of Stone four Story high, hand&s;ome Sa&s;h-Win|dows, and are very well well fur|ni&s;h'd within, the Citizens here being as gay, as gente$l, and per|haps, as rich, as in any in Scotland.</P>
<P N="4">4 The Bridges; particularly that at Old Aberdeen, over the Don: It con&s;i&s;ts of one immen&s;e Arch of Stone, &s;prung from two Rocks, one on each Side, which &s;erve as a Buttment to the Arch, &s;o that it may be &s;aid to have no Founda|tion, nor to need any. The Work|man&s;hip is artful, and $o firm, that it may po&s;&s;ibly End with the Conflagration only. The other Bridge is upon the River Dee, a|bout a Mile We&s;t above New A|berdeen, and has &s;even very &s;tately &s;ine Arches. There are &s;everal other Buildings which &s;hould be de&s;crib'd, if our Work was to dwell here, as the Alms Hou&s;es, Ho&s;pitals, the great Church of St. Nicholas, divided into three, with the S$eeple, and the two va&s;t Bells in it; the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, the Wharf, the Port; all which, con|&s;idering what Part of the World they are in, are really extraordi|nary, and that brings me to the fifth and &s;ixth Articles, which are, indeed of the &s;ame Kind, viz.</P>
<P N="5">5. and 6. The Commerce and the Fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>The Fi&s;hery is very particular; the Salmon is a &s;urpri&s;ing Thing, the Quan|tity that is taken in both Rivers, but e&s;|pecially in the Dee, is a Kind of Prodigy; the Fi&s;hing, or Property, is erected into a Company, and divided into Shares, and no Per&s;on can enjoy above one Share at a Time; the Profits are very con&s;iderable, for the Quantity or Fi&s;h taken is exceed|ing great, and they are &s;ent Abroad into &s;everal Parts of the World, particularly in|to France, England, the Baltick, and &s;e|veral other Parts.</P>
<P>The Herring Fi&s;hing is a common Ble&s;|&s;ing to all this &s;hore of Scotland, and is like the Indies at their Door; the Merchants of Aberdeen cannot omit the Benefit, and with this they are able to carry
<PB REF="536">
on their Trade to Dantzick and Konings|berg, Riga and Narva, Wybourgh and Stockholm, to the more Advantage.</P>
<P>They have a very good Manufacture of Linnen, and al&s;o of Wor&s;ted Stock|ings, which they &s;end to England in great Quantities, and of which they make &s;ome &s;o fine, that I have &s;een them &s;old for fourteen, and twenty Shillings a Pair. They al&s;o &s;end them over to Holland, and into the No th and Ea&s;t in large Quantities.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o a particular Export here of Pork, p ckl'd and packed up in Bar+rels, which they chiefly &s;ell to the Dutch for the victualling their Ea&s;t-India Ships and their Men of War, the Aberdeen Pork having the Reputation of being the be&s;t cured, for Keeping on very long Voyages, of any in Europe.</P>
<P>They export al&s;o Corn and Meal, but they generally bring it from the Fifth of Murray, or Cromarty, the Corn com|ing from abou$ Inverne&s;s, where they have great Quantities.</P>
<P>In a Word, the People of Aberdeen are univer&s;al Merchants, &s;o far as the Trade of the Northern Part of the World will extend. They drive a very great Trade to Holland, to France, to Ham-brough, to Norway, to Gottenburgh, and to the Baltick; and it may, in a Word, be e&s;teemed as the third City in Scotland, that is to &s;ay, next after Edinburgh and Gla&s;gow.</P>
<P>From Aberdeen the Coa&s;t goes on to a Point of Land, which is the farthe&s;t North-Ea&s;t Part of Britain, and is called by the Sailors Suchanne&s;s, being in the Shire or County of Buchan. It was to this Point the French Squadron, with the Pretender on Board, in the Reign of Queen Ann, kept their Flight in Sight of the Shore, being thus far pur&s;ued by Sir George Bing with the Engli&s;h Fleet: But from hence &s;teering away North Ea&s;t, as if for the Norway Coa&s;t, and the Engli&s;h Admiral &s;eeing no Probability of coming up with them, gave over the Cha&s;e, when they, altering their Cour&s;e in the Night, &s;tood away South, and came back to Dunki$$ where they &s;et out.</P>
<P>Upon this Part are &s;everal good Towns&punc; as particularly Peter-Head; a good Mar|ket Town and a Port with a &s;mall Har|bour for Fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els, but no con&s;ider|able Trade, Aberdeen being &s;o near.</P>
<P>This Country, however remote, is full of Nobility and Gentry, and their Seats are &s;een even to the extreme&s;t Shores: The Family of Frazer carrys its Name to Frazerburgh, on the very Northenmo&s;t Point of the County. Ereskines Earls of Marr, have their Family Seat at Kil|drummy, in the County of Marr, a little South of this Part of the Country, where the late unhappy Earl fir&s;t &s;et up his Stan|dard of the Pretender. The Hayes&punc; Earls of Errol, are in Buchan; and the Family of Forbes, Lord Forbes, and Forbes Lord Pit&s;ligo, are &s;till farther, and the latter on the very Shore of the Caledonian Ocean.</P>
<P>Nor does the remote Situation hinder, but the&s;e Gentlemen have the polite&s;t and brighte&s;t Education and Genius of any People &s;o far North, perhaps, in the World, being always bred in Travel Abroad, and in the Univer&s;ities at Home. The Lord Pit&s;ligo, ju&s;t mentioned, though unhappi|ly drawn into the Snare of the late In&s;ur|rection, and forfeiting his E&s;tate with the re&s;t, yet carries Abroad with him, where|ever he goes, a bright Genius, a Head as full of Learning and &s;ound Judgment, and a Behaviour as polite courtly, and full of all the good Qualities that adorn a noble Birth, as mo&s;t Per&s;ons of Quality I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden relates, that on the Coa&s;t of this Country a great Piece of Amber was driven on Shore by the Force of the Sea, as big, to u&s;e his own Words, as a Hor&s;e I &s;hall add nothing to the Story, becau&s;e 'tis hard to give Credit to it; it is enough that I name my Author, for I
<PB REF="537">
could not learn from the Inhabitauts that they ever &s;aw any more of it.</P>
<P>From hence, the Ea&s;t Shore of Scot|land being at an End, the Land trends away due We&s;t; and the Shire of Bamf beginning, you &s;ee the Towns of Bamf, Elgin, and the famous Mona&s;tery of $word$ where the mu$ther'd Body of King Duff was, after many Years, dug up, and di&s;covered to be the &s;ame by &s;ome Tokens, which, it &s;eems, were undoubted.</P>
<P>From this Point of the Land, I mean Buchan Ne&s;s, the Ships take their Di&s;tan|ces, or Accounts, for their &s;everal Voyages; and what they call their Departure: As in England, they do from Winterton-Ne&s;s, on the North Ea&s;t Part of Norfolk, or in the Downs for the Voyages to the Southward.</P>
<P>From Fifene&s;s, which is the Norther|mo&s;t Point, or Head Land on the Mouth of Edinburgh Firth, being the Souther|mo&s;t Land of Fife, to this Point of Buchan-Ne&s;s, the Land lyes due North and South, and the Shore is the Ea&s;termo&s;t Land of Scotland; the Di&s;tance between them is Thirty-three Leagues one Mile, that is ju&s;t 100 Miles; though the Mariners &s;ay that mea&s;uring by the Sea it is but Tweny-eight; and from Winterton-Ne&s;s, near Yarmouth, to this Point called Buchan-Ne&s;s, is ju&s;t 300 Miles.</P>
<P>The River, or Firth of Tay, opens into the Sea, about four Leagues North from $word$ Ne&s;s; and as there is a Light-Hou&s;e on the I&s;le of May, in the Mouth of the Firth or Forth of Edinburgh, a little South of this Point, called F$fe-Ne&s;s; &s;o there are two Light Hou&s;es at the Entrance of the Firth of Tay, being for the Directions of the Sailors, when they are bound into that River; and particularly for their avoiding and &s;ailing between two Sands or Shoals, which lye off from the South Side of the Entrance.</P>
<P>This Point of Land, called Buchan-Ne&s;s, is generally the fir&s;t Land of Great Britain, which the Ships make in their Voyages Home from Arch Angel in Ru&s;&s;ia, or from their Whale-fi&s;hing Voy|ages to Greenland and Spits-Berghen in the North Seas; and near this Point, namely, at Pitfligo, a great Ship was ca&s;t away in Queen Elizabeth's Time, bound Home from Arch-Angel, in which was the fir&s;t Amba&s;&s;ador, which the great Duke of Mu&s;covy &s;ent to any of the Chi&s;tian Princes of Europe, and who was commi&s;&s;ion'd to treat with Queen Eliza|beth for a League of Peace and Com|merce; and on board which was a mo&s;t valuable Pre&s;ent to the Queen of rich and co&s;tly Furrs; &s;uch as Sables, Ermine, black Fox Skins, and &s;uch like, being in tho&s;e Days e&s;teemed ine&s;timable The Amba&s;&s;adors, it &s;eems, were &s;aved and brought on Shore by the help of the Peo|ple of Pitfligo; but the Ship and all the Goods, and among them the rich F$$rs, intended for the Queen, were all lo&s;t, to her Maje&s;ty's great Di&s;appointment; for the Queen valued &s;uch fine Things exceed|ingly.</P>
<P>At the Town of Peter Head there is a &s;mall Harbour with two &s;mall Piers; but it is all dry at Low-Water; So that the &s;malle&s;t Ships lye a&punc;Ground&punc; and can only go in and out at High Water, and then only &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>From this Point of Ea&s;terly Land all that great Bay, or Inlet of the Sea&punc; reach|ing quite to the North of Scotland, is called Murray Firth; and the Norther|mo&s;t Point is Dungsby Head, which is the Ea&s;t Point of Caithne&s;s, and opens to Pentland Firth. By Pentland Firth you are to under&s;tand the Pa&s;&s;age of the Sea beyond Caithne&s;s, that is to &s;ay between Scotland and the I&s;les of Orkney. This Bay, called Murray-Firth, is not in the Nature of a Firth, as that of Edinburgh or Tay, being the Mouth of Rivers; as the Number, or the Mouth of Thames in England: But it is an open Gulph or Bay in the Sea; as the Bay of Bi&s;cay, or the Gulph of Mexico are, and &s;uchlike: And
<PB REF="538">
though it may receive &s;everal Rivers $word$ as indeed it does, and as tho&s;e Bays do; yet it&s;elf is an open Sea, and reaches from, as I have &s;aid, Peter-Head to Dungs by Head, oppo&s;ite to the Orkneys; the Di&s;tance upon the Sea Twenty &s;ix Leagues one Mile, or Seventy-nine Miles; but it is almo&s;t twice as far by Land, becau&s;e of the Depth of that Bay, which obliges us to travel from Pitfligo, We&s;t, near 70 Miles, till we come to Inverne&s;s</P>
<P>This Country of Buchan is, indeed, more to be taken Notice of from what is to be &s;een on the Sea Shore than in the Land; for the Country is mountainous, poor, and more barren than its Neigh|bours; but as we coa&s;ted along We&s;t we came into a much better Country, par|ticularly the Shires of Bamff, Elgin, and the Country of Murray, from whence the Bay, I ju&s;t now mention'd, is called Mur|ray Firth.</P>
<P>Murray is, indeed, a plea&s;ant Country, the Soil fruitful, water'd with fine Rivers, and full of good Towns, but e&s;pecially of Gentlemens Seats, more and more remark|able than could, indeed, be expected by a Stranger in &s;o remote a Part of the Country.</P>
<P>The River Spey, which even Mr Camb|den him&s;elf calls a noble River, pa&s;&s;es through the middle of the Country. Up|on the Bank of this River the Duke of Gordon has a noble Seat call'd after his Name, Ca&s;tle Gordon. It is, indeed a noble, large, and ancient Seat; as a Ca|&s;tle much is not to be &s;aid of it, for old Fortifications are of a &s;mall Import, as the World goes now; But as a Dwelling or Palace for a Nobleman, it is a very noble, &s;pacious, and Royal Building; 'tis only too large, and appears rather as a great Town than as a Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Duke has been embroil'd a little in the late unhappy Affair of the Pretender; but he got off without a for|feiture, having prudently kept him&s;elf at a Di&s;tance from them till he might &s;ee the Effect of Things. The Duke has &s;everal other Seats in this Part of the Country; and which is &s;till better, has a very great E&s;tate.</P>
<P>All the Country, on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Spey, is &s;urpri&s;ingly agreeable, being a flat, level Country, the Land rich and fruitful, well peopled, and full of Gentle|men's Seats. This Country is a Te&s;h|mony how much the &s;ituation of the Land is concern'd in the Goodne&s;s of the Climate; for here the Land being level and plain, for between twenty and thirty Miles together, the Soil is not only fruit|ful and rich, but the Temperature of the Air is &s;often'd, and made mild and &s;uitable to the fruitfulne&s;s of the Earth; for the Harve&s;t in this Country, and in the Vale of Strath-Bogy, and all the Country to Inverne&s;s, is not only forward and early, as well as rich and &s;trong; but 'tis more early than in North than in Northumber|land, nay, than it is in Darby&s;hire, and even than in &s;ome Parts of the mo&s;t &s;outherly Counties in England; as par|ticularly in the Ea&s;t of Kent.</P>
<P>As a Confirmation of this, I affirm that I have &s;een the New Wheat of this Coun|try and Innerne&s;s brought to Market to Ed nburgh, before the Wheat at Edinburgh has been fit to reap; and yet the $ar|ve&s;t about Edinbnrgh is thought to be as forward as in mo&s;t Parts, even of England it&s;elf. In a Word, it is u&s;ual for them to begin their Harve&s;t, in Mur|ray and the Country about it, in the Month of July, and it is not very unu&s;|ual to have New Corn fully Ripe and Thre&s;h'd out, &s;hipp'd off, and brought to Edinburgh to &s;ale, w thin the Month of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor is the forwardne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on the only Te&s;timony of the Goodne&s;s of the &s;oil here; but the Crops are large, the &s;traw &s;trong and tall, and the ear full; and that which is &s;till more, the grain, and that particularly of the wheat, is as full,
<PB REF="539">
and the Kind as fine&punc; as any I have &s;een in England.</P>
<P>In this rich Country is the City, or Town rather, of Elgin; I &s;ay City, be|cau&s;e in ancient Time the Monks claim'd it for a City; and the Cathedral &s;hews, by its Ruins, that it was a Place of great Magnificence. Nor mu&s;t it be wonder'd at, if in &s;o plea&s;ant, &s;o rich, and &s;o agree|able a Part, of the Country, all the re&s;t being &s;o differing from it, the Clergy &s;hould &s;eat them&s;elves in a proportion'd Number&punc; &s;eeing we mu&s;t do them the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that if there is any Place richer and more fruitful than another&punc; they &s;eldom fail to find it ont&punc;</P>
<P>As the Country is rich and plea&s;ant, &s;o here are a great many rich inhabitants, and in the Town of Edgin in particular; for the Gentlemen, as if this was the Edinburgh, or the Court, for this Part of the I&s;land, leave their Highland Habita|tions in the Winter, and come and live here for the Diver&s;ion of the Place and Plenty of Provi&s;ions; and there is, on this Account, a great Variety of Gentle|men for Society, and that of all Parties and of all Opinions, This makes Elgin a very agreeable Place to live, notwith|&s;tanding its Di&s;tance, being above 450 mea&s;ur'd Miles from London, and more, if we mu&s;t go by Edinburgh.</P>
<P>This rich Country continues with very little intermi&s;&s;ion, till we come to Strath-Nairn, that is the Valley of Nairn, where it extends a little farther in Breadth to|wards the Mountains. Nor is Straith-Nairn behind any of the other in Fruit|fulne&s;s: #From the We&s;tern Part of this Country you may ob&s;erve that the Land goes away again to the North; and, as if you were to euter into another I&s;land beyond Britain, you find a large Lake or Inlet from the Sea of Murray, men|tion'd above, going on We&s;t, as if it were to cut through the I&s;land, for we could &s;ee no End of it; nor could &s;ome of the Country People tell us how far it went, but that it reach'd to Loqua|bre: So that we thought, till our Maps and farther inquities inform'd us, it had join'd to the We&s;tern Ocean.</P>
<P>After we had travell'd about 12 Miles, and de&s;cended from a ri&s;ing Ground, which we were then upon; we perceived the Lake contracted in one particular Place to the ordinary &s;ize of a River, as if de&s;ign'd by Nature to give pa&s;&s;age to the inhabitants to conver&s;e with the Northern Part, and then, as if that Part had been &s;ufficiently perform'd, it open'd again to its former Breadth, and continued in the Form of a large Lake, as before, for many more Miles than we could &s;ee; being in the whole, according to Mr. Cambden, twenty-three Miles long; but if it be taken on both Sides the Pa&s;s, 'tis above thirty-five Miles in Length.</P>
<P>This Situation mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make the narrow Part be a mo&s;t important Pa&s;s, from the South Part of Scotland to the Northern Countries, which are beyond it. We have been told the Romans never bonquer'd thus far; and tho&s;e that mag|nify the Conque&s;ts of Oliver Cromwell in Scotland to a Height beyond what was done by the Romans, in&s;i&s;t much upon it, that the Romans never came into this Part of the Country: But, if what Mr Cambden records, and what is con|firm'd by other Accounts from the Men of Learning and of Ob&s;ervation, this mu&s;t be a Mi&s;take; for Mr. Cambden &s;ays, that near Bean-Ca&s;tle in the County of Nairn, there was found, iu the Year 1460, a fine Marble Ve&s;&s;el finely carv'd&punc; which was full of Roman Coins of &s;eve|ral Sorts; al&s;o &s;everal old Forts or Mounts have been &s;een here, which, by their Re|mains, $vidcutly &s;hew'd them&s;elves to be Roman: But that Ehquiry is none of my Work.</P>
<P>In the narrow&punc;Pa&s;s (mention'd above over the Lake) &s;tands the Town and Fortre&s;s
<PB REF="540">
of Inner-Ne&s;s, that is a Town on the in|ner Bank of the River Ne&s;s. The Situ|ation of it, as I have &s;aid before, inti|mates that it is a Place for Strength; and accordingly it has a Ca&s;tle, founded in antient Times to command the Pa&s;s: And &s;ome Authors write that it was antiently a Royal Hou&s;e for the Kings of Scot|land. Be that as it will, Oliver Crom|well thought it a Place of &s;uch Impor|tance; that he built a &s;trong Citadel here, and kept a &s;tated Garri&s;on always in it, and &s;ometimes more than a Garri&s;on, find|ing it needful to have a large Body of his old Veteran Troops po&s;ted here to pre|&s;erve the Peace of the Country, and keep the Highlands in Awe, which they did effectually all his Time.</P>
<P>Here it is ob&s;erved, that at the End of tho&s;e trouble&s;ome Days, when the Troops on all Sides came to be disbanded, and the Men di&s;per&s;ed, Abundance of the Engli&s;h Soldiers &s;ettled in this fruitful and cheap Part of the Country, and two Things are ob&s;erved from it as the Con|&s;equence.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Engli&s;h falling to Husban|dry, and Cultivation of the Earth after their own Manner, were in|&s;trumental, with the Help of a rich and fruitful Soil, to bring all that Part of the Country into &s;o good a Method and Management, as is ob|&s;erved to outdo all the re&s;t of Scot|land to this Day; and this not a lit|tle contributes to the Harve&s;t being &s;o early, and the Corn &s;o good, as is &s;aid above; for as they reap ear|ly, &s;o they &s;ow early, and manure and help the Soil by all the regular Arts of Husbandry, as is practi&s;ed in England, and which, as they learnt it from England, and by Engli&s;h Men, So they pre&s;erve the Know|ledge of it, and al&s;o the Indu&s;try at|tending it, and required for it to this Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. As Cromwell's Soldiers initiated them thus into the Arts and Indu&s;try of the Husbandman,&punc; &s;o they left them the Engli&s;h Accent upon their Tongues&punc; and they pre&s;erve it al&s;o to this Day; for they &s;peak perfect Engli&s;h, even much better than in the mo&s;t Southerly Provinces of Scot|land; nay; &s;ome will &s;ay that they &s;peak it as well as at London; tho' I do not grant that neither. It is certain they keep the Southern Ac|cent very well, and &s;peak very good Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o much of the Engli&s;h Way of living among them, as well in their Manner of Dre&s;s and Cu&s;toms, as al&s;o of their Eating and Drinking, and even of their Dre&s;&s;ing and Cookery, which we found here much more agreeable to Engli&s;h Stomachs than in other Parts of Scotland; all which&punc; and &s;everal other U&s;ages and Cu&s;toms, they retain from the &s;etting of Three Regiments of Eng|li&s;h Soldiers here, after they were dis|banded, and who had, at lea&s;t many of them, their Wives and Children with them.</P>
<P>The Fort, which was then built, and &s;ince demoli&s;hed, has been re&s;tored &s;ince the Revolution; and a Garri&s;on was al|ways kept here by King William, for the better regulating the Highlands; and this Po&s;t was of &s;ingular Importance in the Time of the late In&s;urrection of the Lord Marr for the Pretender; when, though his Party took it, they were driven out again by the Country, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Earl of Sutherland, and &s;everal other of the Nobility and Gentry, who &s;tood fa&s;t to the King's Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Here is a &s;tately Stone Bridge of &s;even large Arches over the River Ne&s;s, where, as I &s;aid above, it grows narrow between the Sea and the Lake; &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els may come up to the Town: but larger Ships, when &s;uch come thither, as they often
<PB REF="541">
do for Corn, lye at &s;ome Di&s;tance Ea&s;t from the Town.</P>
<P>When you are over this Bridge you enter that which we truly call the North of Scotland, and others the North High|lands; in which are &s;everal di&s;tinct Shires, but cannot call for a di&s;tinct De&s;cription, becau&s;e it is all one undi&s;tingui&s;h'd Range of Mountains and Woods, over&s;pread with va&s;t, and almo&s;t uninhabited Rocks and Steeps, fill'd with Deer innumera|ble, and of a great many Kinds; among which are &s;ome of tho&s;e the Antients cal|led Harts and Roebucks, with va&s;t over|grown Stags and Hinds of the Red Deer Kind, and with Fallow Deer al&s;o.</P>
<P>And here, before I de&s;cribe this fright|ful Country, it is needful to ob&s;erve that Scotland may be thus divided into four Di&s;tricts, or di&s;tinct Quarters, which, however, I have not &s;een any of our Geographers do before me; yet, I believe, may not be an improper Mea&s;urement for &s;uch as would form a due Idea of the whole in their Minds, as follows;</P>
<P N="1">1. The South Land, Or that Part of Scotland South of the River Tay, drawing a Line from the Tay, about Perth, to Loch-Lomond, and down again to Dumbarton, and the Bank of Clyde.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Middle, or Midland, Being all the Country from the Tay and the Lough-Lomon, North to the Lake of Ne&s;s and the Aber, including a long Slope to the South, taking in the We&s;tern Highlands of Argyle and Lorn, and the I&s;les of I&s;la and Iura.</P>
<P N="3">3. The North Land, Being all the Country beyond Innerne&s;s and the Lough, or River Ne&s;s, North draw|ing the Line over the narrow Space of Glengary, between the Ne&s;s and the Aber, and bounded by them both from the Ea&s;tern to the We&s;tern Sea.</P>
<P N="4">4. The I&s;lands; Being all the We&s;tern and Northern I&s;lands (viz.) the He|brides, the Skye, the Orkneys, and the I&s;les of Shetland.</P>
<P>Upon the Foot of this Divi&s;ion I am now, having pa&s;s'd the Bridge over the Ne&s;s, enter'd upon the third Divi&s;ion of Scotland, called the North Land; and it is of this Country that, as I am &s;aying, the Mountains are &s;o full of Deer, Harts, Roe-bucks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o a great Number of Eagles which breed in the Woods, and which prey upon the young Fawns when they fir&s;t fall. Some of the&s;e Eagles are of a mighty large Kind, &s;uch as are not to be &s;een again in tho&s;e Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Here are al&s;o the be&s;t Hawks of all the Kinds for Sport which are in the Kingdom, and which the Nobility and Gentry of Scotland make great Ule of; for not this Part of Scotland only, but all the re&s;t of the Country abounds with Wild-Fowl.</P>
<P>The Rivers and Lakes al&s;o in all this Country are prodigiou&s;ly full of Salmon; it is hardly credible what the People relate of the Quantity of Salmon taken in the&s;e Rivers, e&s;pecially in the Spey, the Nairn, the Ne&s;s, and other Rivers thereabout. The &s;everal Countries beyond the Ne&s;s are

<P>The Earl of Sutherland has a Ca&s;tle beyond Innerne&s;s, called Dunrobin, &s;ituate on the Ea&s;tern Shore, which his Lord&s;hip was &s;ent down by Sea to take an early Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of in the late Rebellion; and which, if he had not done, would &s;oon have fallen into the Hands of the late Earl of Marr's Party; but by his coming timely thither it was prevented, and the Country on that Side kept from joining the Troops of the Pretender, at lea&s;t for that Time.</P>
<P><PB REF="542">
Innerne&s;s is a plea&s;ant, clean, and well built Town: There are &s;ome Merchants in it, and &s;ome good &s;hare of Trade. It con&s;i&s;ts of two Pari&s;hes, and two large, hand&s;ome Streets, but no publick Build|ings of any Note, except as above, the old Ca&s;tle and the Bridge.</P>
<P>North of the Mouth of this River is the famous Cromarty Bay, or Cromarty Firth, noted for being the fine&s;t Harbour, with the lea&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s, of perhaps, any in Britain&punc; 'tis, doubtle&s;s, a Harbour or Port, able to receive the Royal Navy of Great Britain, and, like Milford Haven in Wa$es, both the going in and out &s;afe and &s;ecure: But as there is very little Shipping employ'd in the&s;e Parts, and little or no Trade, except for Corn, and in the Sea&s;on of it &s;ome Fi&s;hing; &s;o this noble Harbour is left i$tirely u&s;ele&s;s in the World.</P>
<P>Our Geographers &s;eem to be almo&s;t as much at a lo&s;s in the De&s;cription of this North Part of Scotland, as the Romans were to conquer it; and they are oblig'd to fill it up with Hills and Mountains, as they do the inner Parts of Africa, with Lyons and Elephants, for want of knowing what el&s;e to Place there. Yet this Country is not of &s;uch difficult Ac|ce&s;s, as to be pa&s;s'd unde&s;crib'd, as if it were impenetrable; here being on the Coa&s;t Dornoch a Royal Burgh, &s;ituate upon the Sea, oppo&s;ite to that which they call Tarbat Bay, eminent for the prodigious Quantity of Herrings taken, or, which rather might be taken here in their Sea&s;on. There is a Ca&s;tle here belonging al&s;o to the Earl of Southerland, and it was the Seat of a Bi&s;hop; but the Cathedral, which is but mean, is now otherwi&s;e employ'd</P>
<P>All the Country beyond this River, and the Loch flowing in it, is call'd Caithne&s;s, and extends to the Northermo&s;t Land in Scotland.</P>
<P>Some People tell us they have both Lead, Copper, and Iron in this Part of Scotland; and I am very much inclin'd to believe it: But it &s;eems re&s;erv'd for a future, and more indu&s;trious Age to &s;earch into; which, if it &s;hould happen to ap|pear, e&s;pecially the Iron, they would no more have Occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that Nature furni&s;h'd them with &s;o much Timber, and Woods of &s;uch va&s;t Extent to no Purpo&s;e, &s;eeing it may be all little enough to &s;up|ply the Forges for working up the Iri&s;h Stone, and improving that u&s;eful Pro|duct: And &s;hould a Time come when the&s;e hidden Trea&s;ures of the Earth &s;hould be di&s;cover'd and improv'd. This Part of Scotland may no longer be call'd Poor, for &s;uch a Production would &s;oon change the Face of Things, bring Wealth and People, and Commerce to it; fill their Harbours full of Ships, their Towns full of People; and, by con&s;uming the Provi&s;ions, bring the Soil to be cultivated&punc; its Ei&s;h cur'd, and its Cattle con&s;um'd at Home&punc; and &s;o a vi&s;ible Pro&s;perity would &s;hew it&s;elf among them.</P>
<P>Nor are the Inhabitants &s;o wild and barbarous as, perhaps they were in tho&s;e Times&punc; or as our Writers have pretend|ed. We &s;ee every Day the Gentlemen born here, &s;uch as the Mackenzies, Mac|Leans, Dondonalds, Gordons, Mac-Kays, and others, who are nam'd among the Clans, as if they were Barbarians, appear at Court, and in our Camps and Armies, as polite, and as fini&s;h'd Gentlemen as any from other Countries, or even among our own; and, if I &s;hould &s;ay, outdoing our own in many Things, e&s;pecially in Arms and Gallantry, as well Abroad as at Home. But I am not writing Pane|gyricks or Satyrs here, my Bu&s;ine&s;s is with the Country: There is no Room to doubt, but in this remote Part of the I&s;land the Country is more wild and uncultivated, as it is mountainous, and (in &s;ome Parts) thinner of Inhabitants, than in the more Southern Parts of the I&s;land.</P>
<P><PB REF="543">
$line$ live di&s;pers'd, the Gent$y $eading the Commons or Va&s;&s;als, as they are call'd, to dwell within the re&s;pective Bounds of their &s;everal Clans, where they are, as we may &s;ay, little Monarchs, reign|ing in their own Dominions; nor do the People know any other Sovereign, at lea&s;t many of them do not.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ions the People to live di&s;|pers'd among the Hills without any &s;et|tl d Towns. Their Employment is chief|ly $$nting, which is&punc; as we may &s;ay, for their Food; though they do al&s;o breed large Quantities of black Cattle, with which they pay their Lairds or Leaders the Rent of their Lands: And the&s;e are the Cattle which, even from the remote&s;t Parts, as well as from other in the We&s;t and South, are driven annually to England to be &s;old, and are brought up $span$ London, e&s;pecially into the Coun|tries of Norfolk, Suffolk, and E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>Having thus, as I &s;ay&punc; few or no Towns to de&s;cribe North of Innerne&s;s, it mu&s;t $nffice, tha$ I thus give a ju&s;t De&s;cription of the Country in general: For Exam|pl It is &s;urrounded with the Sea, and th$&s; two great Inlets of Water, men|tion'd above, call'd the Ne&s;s and the Abre: So that except a &s;mall Part, or N$k of Land, reaching from one to the $word$ and which is not above &s;ix Miles, I mean that Country which Mr. Camb|den calls the Garrow, or Giengarrough, other&punc; Glengary; I &s;ay, this Neck of $and excepted, the whole Divi&s;ion, as form'd above under the Head of the North Land, would be a di&s;ti$ct I&s;land, &s;eperated from all the re&s;t of Great Britain, as effectually as the Orkneys or the I&s;le of Skey is &s;e|parated from this.</P>
<P>In a Word, the great Northern Ocean &s;urrounds this whole Part of Scotland; $hat Part of it to the Ea&s;t, mention'd ju&s;t now, lyes open to the Sea without any Cover; the We&s;t and North Parts are, as it were, &s;urrounded with Out-works as Defences, to break off the raging O|cean from the North; for the We&s;tern I&s;lands on one Side, and the Orkneys on the other, lie &s;o many advanc d Fortifica|tions or Redoubts, to combat that Ene|my at a Di&s;tance. I &s;hall view them in their Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>From Dunrobin Ca&s;tle which I mention'd before, you have nothing of Note offers it&s;elf, either by Sea or Land; but an extended Shore lying North and South without Towns and without Harbours, and indeed, as there are none of the fir&s;t, &s;o there are wanting none of the la&s;t; for, as I &s;aid of Cromarty Bay, there is a no|ble Harbour without Ships or Trade: So here Nature, a$ if providentially fore|&s;eeing there was no Room for Trade, forbore giving her&s;elf the Trouble to form Harbour and Creeks where they &s;hould be u&s;ele&s;s, and without People.</P>
<P>The Land thus extended as above, lyes North and South to Dungsby-Head, which is the utmo&s;t Extent of the Land on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of Britain, North, and is di&s;tant from Cromarty eighteen Leagues North. This Point of Dingsby, or Dungsby-Head, is in the North Part, as I ob&s;erv'd of Bu|chan and Winnerton before; 'tis the Place from whence the Sailors take and keep their Accounts in their going farther North; As for Example;</P>
<P>From this Point of Dingsby-Head to the Fair I&s;le, which is the fir&s;t of Shet|land&punc; or the la&s;t of the Orkneys, call it which we will, for it lyes between both, is 25 Leagues, 75 Miles.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame Dingsby Head to Sum|burgh Head, that is to Shetland, is 32 Leagues, 96 Milos, and to Le$wick Fort in Shetland 110 Miles.</P>
<P>Thus from Buchan Ne&s;s, to Sumburgh-Head in Shetland, is 47 Leagues.</P>
<P>And from Winterton Ne&s;s near Yar|mouth, on the Coa&s;t of Norfolk, to Buchan
<PB REF="544">

<PB REF="545">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB REF="546">
Ne$s, on the Coa&s;t of Aberdeen&punc; $span$ 100 Leagues. So from Winterton to Shetland is 147 Leagues, 441 Miles.</P>
<P>But this is the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Mariners. I am now to ob&s;erve that we are here at the extreme&s;t End or Point of the I&s;land of Great Britain; and that here the Land bears away We&s;t, leaving a large Strait or Sea, which they call Pentland Firth, and which divides, between the I&s;land of Great Britain, and the I&s;les of the Orkneys; a Pa&s;&s;age broad and fair, for 'tis not le&s;s than five Leagues over, and with a great Depth of Water; &s;o that any Ships, or Fleets of Ships may go thro' it: But the Tides are &s;o fierce, &s;o uncertain, and the Gu&s;ts and &s;uddain Squals of Wind &s;o frequent, that very few Merchants-Ships care to venture thro' it; and the Dutch Ea&s;t India Ships, which come North about, (as 'tis called) in their Return from India, keep all farther off, and choo&s;e to come by Fair I&s;le, that is to &s;ay, in the Pa&s;&s;age between the I&s;lands of Orkney and Shetland. And here the Dutch &s;end their Squadron of Men of War generally to meet them, becau&s;e, as if it were in a narrow Lane, they are &s;ure to meet with them there.</P>
<P>Here the Pa&s;&s;age is not only broader; for it is at lea&s;t nine Leagues from North Ranal&s;ha, the farthe&s;t I&s;land of the Ork|neys, to Fair I&s;le, and five more from Fair I&s;le to Shetland: So that they have a Pa&s;&s;age of fourteen Leagues between the Orkneys and Shetland, with only a &s;mall I&s;land in the Way, which has no|thing dangerous about it; al&s;o the Moun|tainous Country being now all out of Reach; the Sea is open and calm, as in other Places: nor is there any dangerous Current or Shoals to di&s;turb them.</P>
<P>In the Pa&s;&s;age, between the Lands End of Britain and the Orkneys, is a &s;mall I&s;land, which our Mariners call Stroma, Mr. Cambden and others Sowna; 'tis &s;poken much of as dangerous for Ships: But I &s;ee no Room to record any Thing $line$ draw Ships on Shore to their Misfortunes. Such Things I leave to the People who are of the Opinion the Devil has &s;uch Retreats for doing Mi&s;chief; for my own Part I believe him employed in Bu&s;ine&s;s of more Moment.</P>
<P>As Dingsby Head is the mo&s;t Norther|ly Land of Great Britain, 'tis wor h ob|&s;erving to you that here, in the Month of June, we had &s;o clear an uninterrup$|ed Day, that, though indeed the Sun d$es &s;er, that is to &s;ay, the Horizon covers it's whole Body for &s;ome Hours, yet you might &s;ee to read the &s;malle&s;t Print, and to write di&s;tinctly, without the Help of a Candle, or any other Light, and that all Night long.</P>
<P>No wonder the antient Mariners, be they Phoenician or Carthaginian, or what el&s;e you plea&s;e, who in tho&s;e Days knew nothing of the Motion of the heavenly Bodies, when they were driven thus far, were &s;urpri&s;ed at finding they had lo&s;t the &s;teady Rotation of Day and Night, which they thought had &s;pread over the whole Globe.</P>
<P>No wonder they talked much of their Ultima Thule, and that the Ely&s;ian Fields mu&s;t lye this Way; when they found that they were already come to everla&s;t|ing Day, they could no longer doubt but Heaven lay that Way, or at lea&s;t that this was the high Way to it; and accord|ingly, when they came Home, and were to give an Account of the&s;e Things a|mong their Neighbours, they filled them with A&s;toni&s;hment; and 'twas wounderful they did not really fit out Ships for the Di&s;covery; for who would ever have gone &s;o near Heaven, and not ventured a little farther to &s;ee whether they could find it or no?</P>
<P>From hence We&s;t we go along the Shore of the Firth or Pa&s;&s;age, which they call Pentland; and here is the Hou&s;e &s;o fa|mous, called John a Grot's Hou&s;e, where

$line$ the mo&s;t northerly Land, as the People &s;ay, of Britain, though, I think, Dungs|by-Head is as far North. 'Tis certain, however, the Difference is but very &s;mall, being either of them in the Latitude of 59 16th North, and Shetland reaching a|bove two Degrees farther. The Domi|nions of Great Britain are extended from the I&s;le of Wight, in the Latitude of 50 Degrees, to the I&s;les of Un$ta in Shetland, in the Latitude of 61 Degrees, 30 Minutes, being Ten Degrees, or full 660 Miles in Length; which I&s;land of Un&s;t or Un&s;ta being the mo&s;t remote of the I&s;les of Shetland to the North Ea&s;t, lyes 167 Leagues from Winterton Ne&s;s in Nor|folk.</P>
<P>Here we found, however, mountain|ous and wild the Country appeared, the People were extremely well furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ions; and e&s;pecially they had four Sorts of Provi&s;ions in great Plenty; and with a Supply of which 'tis rea&s;on able to &s;ay they could &s;uffer no dangerous Want.</P>
<P N="1">1. Very good Bread, as well Oat Bread as Wheat, though the la&s;t &s;o cheap as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Veni&s;on exceeding plentiful, and at all Sea&s;ons, young or old, which they kill with their Guns wherever they find it; for there is no Re&s;traint, but 'tis every Man's own that can kill it. By which Means the High|landers not only have all of them Fire Arms, but they are all excel|lent Mark&s;men.</P>
<P N="3">3 Salmon in &s;uch Plenty as is &s;carce credible, and &s;o cheap, that to tho&s;e who have any Sub&s;tance to buy with, it is not worth their while to catch it them&s;elves. This they eat fre&s;h in the Sea&s;on, and for other Times they cure it by drying it in the Sun, by which they pre&s;erve it all the Year.</P>
<P>They have no want of Cows and Sheep, but the latter are &s;o wild, that &s;ometimes were they not, by their own Di&s;po&s;ition, u&s;e to flock together, they would be much harder to kill than the Deer.</P>
<P>From hence to the We&s;t Point of the Pa&s;&s;age to Orkney is near Twenty Miles, being what may be called the End of the I&s;land of Britain; and this Part faces di|rectly to $he North Pole; the Land, as it were, looking forward ju&s;t again&s;t the Pole Star, and the Pole &s;o elevated, that the Tail of the Ur&s;a Major, or the Great Bear, is &s;een ju&s;t in the Zenith, or over your Head; and the Day is &s;aid to be Eighteen Hours long, that is to &s;ay, the Sun is &s;o long above the Horizon: Bu$ the re&s;t of the Light is &s;o far beyond a Twilight, by rea&s;on of the Smalne&s;s of the Arch of that Circle, which the Sun makes beneath the Horizon, that it is clear and perfect Day almo&s;t all the T m$; not forgetting withal, that the dark Nights take their turn with them in their Sea|&s;on, and it is ju&s;t as long Night in the Winter.</P>
<P>Yet it is ob&s;ervable here, that they have more temperate Winters here gener|ally &s;peaking, than we have to the mo&s;t &s;outherly Part of the I&s;land, and particu|larly the Water in &s;ome of the Rivers as in the Ne&s;s, for Example, never Freezes, nor are their Fro&s;ts ordinarily &s;o la&s;ting as they are in the mo&s;t &s;outherly Climates, which is accounted for from the nearne&s;s of the Sea, which filling the Air with moi&s;t Vapours, thickens the Fluids and and Cau&s;es, that they are not &s;o ea&s;ily penetrated by the &s;everity of the Cold.</P>
<P>On this account the Snow's al&s;o are not &s;o deep, neither do they lie &s;o long upon the Ground, as in other Places, except it be on &s;ome of the high Hills, in the up|per and innermo&s;t Part of the Country, where the Tops, or Summits of the Hills are continually cover'd with Snow, and perhaps have been &s;o for many Ages, &s;o that here if in any Place of the World

<L>And Mountains cover'd with eternal Snow&punc;</L></Q>
<P>On the mo&s;t inland Parts of this Coun|try, e&s;pecially in the Shire of Ro&s;s, they have va&s;t Woods of Fi$$-Trees, not plant|ed and &s;et by Mens H$nds, as I have de&s;cribed the fouthern Part of Scotland; but growing wild and undirected, other|wi&s;e than as nature planted and nouri&s;hed them up, by the additional help of Time, nay of Ages. Here are Woods reach|ing from ten, to fifteen, and twenty Miles in length, and proportioned in breadth, in which there are Firrs, if we may believe the inhabitants, large enough to make Ma&s;ts for the bigge&s;t Ships in the Navy Royal, and which are rendered of no U&s;e, meerly for want of Conve|nience of water Carriage to bring them away; al&s;o they a&s;&s;ure us there are a &s;ufficient Quantity of other Timber for a &s;upply to all Britain.</P>
<P>How far this may be true, that is to &s;ay, as to the Quantity, that I not do undertake to determine: But I mu&s;t add a needful Memorandum to the Scots No|blemen&punc; &amp;c. in who&s;e E&s;tates the&s;e Woods grow, that if they cannot be made u&s;eful one way, they may be made &s;o another, and if they cannot $ell the Timber, and cut it into Ma&s;ts and Deals, and other u&s;eful Things for bringing away, having no Navigation; they may yet burn it, and draw from it va&s;t quantities of Pitch, Tar, Ro&s;in, Turpentine, &amp;c. which is of ea&s;ier Carriage, and may be carried on Hor&s;es to the Water's edge, and then &s;hipp'd for the u&s;e of the Merchant, and this way their Woods may be made profitable, whatever they might be be|fore.</P>
<P>We find no Manufactures among the $line$ men call their Th$$, namely, Sp$$ring of Woollen, or Linnen for their own U&s;es, and indeed not much of that; per|haps, the time may come, when they may be better and more profitably em|ploy'd that way; for if as I have ob|&s;erv'd, they &s;hould once come to We$k the Mines, which there is rea&s;on to be|lieve are to be found there, and to &s;earch the Bowels of the Earth, for Iron and Copper, the People would &s;oon learn to &s;$ay at Home, and the Women would find Work as well as the Men: but this mu&s;t be left to Time and Po&s;te|rity.</P>
<P>We were now in the particular Coun|ty called Strathnaver, or the Vale on the Naver, the remote&s;t Part of all the I&s;land, though not the mo&s;t barren or unfruitful; for here as well as on the Ea&s;tern &s;hore is good Corn produced, and &s;ufficiently of it at lea&s;t for the in|habitants; perhaps they do not &s;end much abroad, though &s;ometimes al&s;o they &s;end it over to the Orkneys, and al&s;o to Shet|land This County belongs to the Earl of Southerland who&s;e olde&s;t Son bears the Title of Lord Strathnaver.</P>
<P>And now leaving the Northern Pro&s;|pect we pa&s;s the oppo&s;ite Point We&s;t from Dingsby-Head, and which the Peo|ple call Farro Head, tho' Mr. $word$ (by what Authority, or from what Original, I know not) gives of a long Account of, and call the&s;e two Points by two op|po&s;ite Names:&mdash;</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t Point, or Dungsby Head, he calls <HI>Virvedrum Promontorium.</HI></P>
<P>The We&s;t Point or Farro Head, he calls <HI>Sarvedrum Promontorium.</HI></P>
<P>From hence the va&s;t We&s;tern Ocean appears, what Name to give it the Geo|graphers them&s;elves do not &s;eem to ag$$, but it certaiuly makes a Part of the great Atlantick Sea, and is to be called by no other Name, for it has no Country to derive from.</P>
<P><PB REF="549">
And now we were to turn our Faces South for the I&s;lands of this Sea, which make the fourth Divi&s;ion of Scotland, as mentioned before; I may if I have room give as ju&s;t a De&s;cription of them as I can from authentick Relations; for be|ing on Hor&s;eback and no Conveniences of Shipping pre&s;enting it &s;elf here, I am to own that we did not go over to tho&s;e I&s;lands per&s;onally, neither was it likely any Per&s;on who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s was meer Curio&s;ity and Diver&s;ion&punc; &s;hould either be at the Expence&punc; or run the Ri&s;que of &s;uch a hazardous Pa&s;&s;age where there was &s;o little worth Ob&s;ervation to be found.</P>
<P>We therefore turned our Faces to the South&punc; and with great Satisfaction after &s;o long and fariguing a Journey; and un|le&s;s we had been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Gentle|men of the Country, and with very good Guides, it had been next to an impo&s;&s;ibi|lity to have pa&s;s'd over this Part of the Country. I do confe&s;s if I was to re|commend to any Men who&s;e Curio&s;ity tempted them to travel over this Part of the Country, the be&s;t Method for their Journeying, it &s;hould be neither to &s;eek Towns&punc; for it would be impo&s;|&s;ible to find &s;uch in proper Stages for their Journey; nor to make them&s;elves always burthen&s;ome to the High-land Chiefs, tho' there I can a&s;&s;ure them they would always meet with great Treatment, and great Ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>But I would propo&s;e Travelling with &s;ome Company, and carrying Tents with them, and &s;o encamping every Night, as if they were an Army.</P>
<P>It is true they would do well to have the Countenance of the Gentlemen, and Chiefs as above, and to be recommended t$ them from their Friends from one to another, as well for Guides as for Safety&punc; otherwi&s;e I would not an&s;wer for what might happen: But if they are fir&s;t well recommended as Strangers, and have Let|ters from one Gentleman to another, they would want neither Guides nor Guards, nor indeed would any Man touch them; but rather protect them if there was Occa&s;ion in all Places; and by this Method they might in the Summer time Lodge, when&punc; and wherever they plea&s;ed, with Safety and Plea&s;ure; travelling no farther at a Time&punc; than they thought fit; and as for their Provi&s;ions, they might &s;upply them&s;elves by their Guns, with very great plenty of Wild Fowl, and their Attendants and Guides would find convenient Places to furni&s;h other Things &s;ufficient to carry with them.</P>
<P>It would be no unplea&s;ant account to relate a Journey which five, two Scots, and three Engli&s;h Gentlemen took in this manner for their Diver&s;ion, in order to vi&s;it the late Duke of Gordon, but it would be too long for this Place: It would be very diverting to &s;hew how they lodg'd every Night. How two Highlanders who attended them, and who had been in the Army, went be|fore every Evening and pitch'd their little Camp. How they furni&s;h'd them|&s;elves with Provi&s;ions, carry'd &s;ome with them, and dreis'd and prepared what they kill'd with their Guns; and how very ea&s;ily they travelled over all the Moun|tains and Wa&s;ts, without troubling them|&s;elves with Hou&s;es or Lodgings; but as I &s;ay the Particulars are too long for this Place.</P>
<P>Indeed in our Attempt to come down to the Southward by the Coa&s;t of Tain, and the Shire of Ro&s;s, we &s;hould have been
<PB REF="550">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">

<PB REF="552">
extreamly Di&s;appointed, and perhaps have been obliged to get a Ship or Bark, or have carry'd us round the Ifle of Sky in|to Loquhaber, had it not been for the ex|traordinary Courte&s;ie of &s;ome of the Gen|tlemen of the Country.</P>
<P>On the other hand we unexpectedly met here &s;ome Engli&s;h Men, who were employed by Merchants in the S. (whe|ther at London or Edinburgh I do not now remember) to take and cure a large Quantity of White Fi&s;h, and afterwards of Herrings, on account of Trade. Here we had not only the Civility of their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance and Accommodation in our Jour|ney, but we had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing what Progre&s;s they made in their Under|taking.</P>
<P>As for Herrings indeed the Quantity was prodigious, and we had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;omething of the Prodigy, for I can call it no other; the Shoal was as I might &s;ay beginning to come, or had &s;ent their Vant Couriers before them, when we fir&s;t came to the Head of Pentland Firth, and in a Fortnight's Time more, the Body of their numberle&s;s Armies be|gan to appear; but before we left the Coa&s;t you would have ventured to &s;ay of the Sea, as they do of the River Tibi&s;cus, or Thei&s;&s;e in Hungary, that it was one third Water, and two thirds Fi&s;h; the Operation of taking them, could hardly be called Fi&s;hing, for they did little more than dip for them into the Water and take them up.</P>
<P>As to the Quantity, I make no &s;cruple to &s;ay, that if there had been ten thou|&s;and Ships there to have loaded with them, they might all have been filled and none of them mi&s;t; nor did the Fi&s;h &s;eem to &s;tay, but pa&s;&s;ed on to the South, that they might &s;upply other Parts, and make way al&s;o for tho&s;e innumerable Shoals which were to come after.</P>
<P>Had the Quantity of white Fi&s;h been any way proportioned to the Undertak|ing as the Herring was, there would no doubt have been &s;uch Encouragement to the Merchant, that they would never have given it over, but they found it would not fully an&s;wer: Not but there were great Quantities of Cod, and the Fi&s;h very &s;izeable and good, but not &s;o great a Quantity as to make that di&s;patch in taking them (as they are taken with Hook and Line) &s;ufficient for Loading of Ships, or laying up a large Quantity in the Sea&s;on; and this I doubt di&s;couraged the Undertaking, the Merchants finding the Expence to exceed the Return.</P>
<P>Here we found the Town of Tain, and &s;ome other Villages tollerably well inhabited, and &s;ome Trade al&s;o, occa&s;i|oned principally by the Communication with the We&s;tern I&s;lands, and al&s;o by the Herring Fi&s;hing, the Fi&s;hing Boats from other Parts often putting into the&s;e Ports; for all their Coa&s;t is full of Loughs and Rivers, and other Openings which make very good Harbours for Shipping; and that which is remarkable, &s;ome of tho&s;e Loughs, are infinitely full of Herrings, even where, as they tell us, they have no Communication with the Sea, &s;o that they mu&s;t have in all probability been put in|to them alive by &s;ome particular Hands, and have multiplied there as we find at this time.</P>
<P>We could under&s;tand nothing on this Side of what the People &s;aid, any more than if we had been in Morocco; and all the Remedy we had was, that we found mo&s;t of the Gentlemen &s;poke French, and &s;ome few &s;poke broad Scots; we found it al&s;o much for our convenience to make the common People believe we were French.</P>
<P>Should we go about here to give you an Account of the Religion of the Peo|ple in this Country, it would be an un|plea&s;ant Work, and perhaps &s;carce &s;eem to de&s;erve credit; you would hardly be|lieve that in a Chri&s;tian I&s;land, as this is &s;aid to be, there &s;hould be People found who know &s;o little of Religion, or of the
<PB REF="553">
Cu&s;tom of Chri&s;tians, as not to know a Sunday, or Sabbath, from a working Day, or the Wor&s;hip of God from an ordinary Meeting, for Conver&s;ation: I do not affirm that it is &s;o, and I &s;hall &s;ay no more of it here, becau&s;e I would not publi&s;h it, for it is to be hoped may in time find Redre&s;s; but I cannot but &s;ay that his Maje&s;ty's Gift of 1000l. annually to the A&s;&s;embly of Scotland, for &s;ending Mini&s;ters or Mi&s;&s;i|onaries for the propagating Chri&s;tian know|ledge in the Highlands, is certainly one of the mo&s;t needful Charities that could have been thought of, worth of a King, and well &s;uited to that Occa&s;ion; and if prudently applyed, as there is Rea&s;on to believe it will be, may in time break in upon this horrible Ignorance, that has &s;o far &s;pread over this unhappy Part of the Country.</P>
<P>On the other hand, What &s;hall we &s;ay to the Neglect, which for &s;o many Years pa&s;t has been the Occa&s;ion of this &s;ur|prizing Darkne&s;s among the People, when the poor abandoned Creatures have not &s;o much as had the common In&s;truction of Chri&s;tianity, &s;o much as to know whether there was any &s;uch thing as a God or no, much le&s;s how to wor&s;hip him; and if at any time any Glymp&s;e of light had been $fu&s;&s;ed into them, and they had been $ught any Knowledge of &s;uperior Things; $word$ has been by the Diligence of the Popi&s;h $lergy, who to do them ju&s;tice, have $ewn more Charity, and taken more $word$ that way, than &s;ome who&s;e work it $word$ been, and who it might much more $ve been expected from?</P>
<P>But the State of Religion is not my $e&s;ent Subject; 'tis certain the People we the Bible in their own Language, the $word$ and the Mi&s;&s;ionaries now are obliged preach to them, and examine or $word$ their Children in the Irs Language, that we are not to de&s;pair of having $word$ County as well in&s;tructed in time, as is $word$ Parts of Britain: the re&s;t mu&s;t be $word$ to his Hand, that over rules the Minds of Men, and cau&s;es them to know, even in Spite of the Defects, of common Teach|ing.</P>
<P>On this Coa&s;t is the I&s;le of Eky, ly|ing from the We&s;t North We&s;t, to the Ea&s;t South Ea&s;t, and bearing upon the Main I&s;land, only &s;eparated by a narrow Strait of Water; &s;ometh ng like as the I&s;le of Wight is &s;eparated from the Coun|ty of Southampton. We left this on our Right, and cro&s;&s;ing the Mountains, came with as little Stay as we could to the Lough of Abre, that is, the Water which as I &s;aid above, a&s;&s;i&s;ts with Lough Me&s;s&punc; or Loch Ne&s;s, to &s;eparte the North Land of Scotland, from the middle Part.</P>
<P>This is a long and narrow Inlet of the Sea which opening from the Iri&s;h Sea S. We&s;t, meets the River Abre, or as the Scots much more properly expre&s;s it, the Water of Abre, for it it rather a large Lake or Loch, than a River, and receives in|numerable &s;mall Rivers into it; it begins or ri&s;es in the Mountains of Ro&s;s&punc; or of Glengary, within five or &s;ix Miles from the Shore of the Loch Ne&s;s, or the Wa|ter of Ne&s;s, which is a long and narrow Lake it &s;elf and as the Ne&s;s runs away Ea&s;t to Inverne&s;s, and &s;o into the great Gulph called Murray Firth; &s;o the Abre becoming pre&s;ently a Loch or Lake, al&s;o goes away more to the Southward, and &s;loping South We&s;t, runs into the Iri&s;h Sea as above.</P>
<P>From this River or Water of Abre, all that mountainous barren and frightful Country, which lies South of the Water of Abre is called Loquabre, or the Coun|try bordering on Loch Abre. It is indeed a frightful Country full of hidious de&s;art Mountains and unpa&s;&s;able, except to the Highlanders who po&s;&s;e&s;s the Precipices. Here in &s;pight of the mo&s;t vigorous Pur|&s;uit, the Highland Robbers, &s;uch as the famous Rob Roy in the late Di&s;turbances, find &s;uch Retreats as none can pretend to follow them into, nor could he be ever taken.</P>
<P><PB REF="554">
On this Water of Abre, ju&s;t at the En|trance of the Lock, was anciently a Fort built, to curb the Highlanders, on either Side; it was &s;o &s;ituated, that tho' it might indeed be block'd up by Land and be de&s;tre&s;s'd by a Siege, the Troops be|&s;ieging being Ma&s;ters of the Field; yet as it was open to the Sea, it might always receive Supplies by Shipping&punc; the Govern|ment being &s;uppo&s;ed to be always Ma&s;ter of the Sea, or at lea&s;t 'tis very probable they will be &s;o.</P>
<P>This Fort the late King William cau&s;ed to be rebuilt, or rather a new Fort to be erected; where there was always a good Garri&s;on kept for curbing the Highlan|ders, which Fort was for &s;everal Years commanded by Lieutenant General Mait|land, an old experienc'd General, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf upon many Occa|&s;ions abroad, particularly at the great Bat|tle of Treves, where he &s;erved under the French and where he lo&s;t one of his Hands.</P>
<P>I Name this Gentleman, not to pay any Complement to him, for he is long ago in his Grave, but to intimate that this wi&s;e Commander did more to gain the Highlanders and keep them in Peace, and in a due Subjection to the Briti&s;h Go|vernment, by his winning and obliging Behaviour, and yet by &s;trict ob&s;ervance of his Orde s, and the Duty of a Govern|our, than any other before him had been able to do by Force, and the Sword; and this particularly appear'd in the Time of the Union, when Endeavours were every where made u&s;e of, to bring th &s;e hot People to break out into Rebellion, if po&s;&s;ible to prevent the carrying on the Treaty.</P>
<P>At this Place we take our leave of the Third Divi&s;ion, which I call the North Land of Scotland, for this Fort being on the South Side of the Lock Abre is there|fore called inner Lochy, as the other for the like Rea&s;on was called inner Ne&s;s.</P>
<P>We have nothing now remaining for a full Survey of Scotland, but the We&s;tern Part, of the Middle Part, or Divi&s;ion of Scotland, and this though a large Coun|try, yet affords not an equal Variety with the Ea&s;tern part of the &s;ame Di|vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>To traver&s;e the remaining Part of this Country, I mu&s;t then begin up|on the upper Tay, as we may ju&s;t|ly call it, where I left off when I turn'd away Ea&s;t; and here we have in e&s;pecial manner the Country of Bre|chin, the Blair as 'tis called of A$hol, and the Country of Bradalbin: This is a Hilly Country indeed, but as it is water'd by the Tay, and many other plea&s;ant Rivers which fall into it, there are al&s;o &s;everal fruitful Valleys, inter|&s;per&s;t among the Hills; nor are even the Highlands them&s;elves, or the High|landers the Inhabitants any thing &s;o wild, untaught, or untractable, as tho&s;e whom I have been a de&s;cribing in the North-Land Divi&s;ion, that is to &s;ay, in Strath-Naver, Ro&s;s, Tain, &amp;c</P>
<P>The Duke of Athol is Lord, I was al|mo&s;t going to &s;ay King of this Country, and has the greate&s;t intere&s;t, or if you plea&s;e, the greate&s;t &s;hare of Va&s;&s;alage of any Nobleman in this Part of Scotland: if I had &s;aid in all Scotland, I believe I &s;hould have been &s;upported by others that know both his Per&s;on and his Intere&s;t as well as mo&s;t People do.</P>
<P>His Grace was always an Oppo&s;er of the Union in the Parliament holden at Edinburgh, for pa&s;&s;ing it into an Act; but he did not carry his Oppo&s;ition to the Height of Tumult aud Rebellion; if he had, as &s;ome were forward to have had done, he would have po&s;&s;ibly bid fair, to have prevented the Conclu&s;ion of it, at lea&s;t at that Time: But the Hour was come, when $ the Calamities of War, which had for &s;o many hundred Years vext the two Nations, were to have as End; and tho' the Government was
<PB REF="555">
never weaker in Power than at that Time, I mean in Scotland, yet the Affair was carried thro' with a high Hand, all the little Tumults and Di&s;orders of the Rab|ble as well at Edinburgh as at Gla&s;gow, and other Places, being timely &s;uppre&s;t, and others by prudent Management pre|vented</P>
<P>The Duke has &s;everal fine Seats in this Country; as fir&s;t at Dunkeld, upon the Tay which I mentioned before, and where there was a Fight, between the regular Troops and the Highlanders, in the Reign of King William; another at Huntingtour, in the Strathern, or Valley of $word$ where the Duke has a fine Park, and great &s;tore of Deer; and it may in|deed be called his Hunting Seat, whether he &s;ometimes retires meerly for Sport.</P>
<P>But his ordinary Re&s;idence, and where I &s;ay he keeps his Court like a Prince, is at the Ca&s;tle of Blair, farther North and beyond the Tay, on the Edge of Brad$lbin upon the Banks of a clear and fine River which falls into the Tay, a few Miles lower.</P>
<P>As I have &s;aid &s;omething of this Coun|try of Bradalbin, it will be needful to &s;ay &s;omething more, &s;eeing &s;ome other Authors have &s;aid &s;o much: It is &s;eated as near the Center of Scotland, as any Part of it can be well fixt, and that which is Particular, is, that it is alledg'd, it is the highe&s;t Ground in Scotland, for that the Rivers which ri&s;e here, are &s;aid to run every Way from this Part, &s;ome into the Ea&s;tern, and &s;ome into the We&s;t|ern Seas.</P>
<P>The Grampian Mountains, which are $ere &s;aid to cut through Scotland; as the Mu&s;covites &s;av of their <HI>Riphaean</HI> Hills, $hey are the Girdle of the World. As $word$ the Country, &s;o are the Inhabitants, a $eree fighting and furious Kind of Men; $$t I mu&s;t add that they are much changed, $nd civiliz'd from what they were for|$erly, if Mr. Cambden's Account of $hem is ju&s;t. I mean of the Highlanders of Bradalbin only; tho' I include th$ Country of Loquhabre, and Athol, as adjoyning to it.</P>
<P>It is indeed a very better Character, and po&s;&s;ibly they might de&s;erve it in tho&s;e Days; but I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that they are quite another People now: And tho' the Coun|try is the &s;ame, and the Mountains as wild and de&s;olate as ever; yet the People, by the good Conduct of their Chiefs and Heads of Clans, are much more civilized than they were in former Times.</P>
<P>As the Men have the &s;ame Vigour and Spirit; but are under a bettet Regulation of their Manners, and more under Go|vernment; &s;o they make excellent Sol|diers, when they come abroad, or are li&s;ted in regular and di&s;ciplin'd Troops.</P>
<P>The Duke of Athol, though he has not an E&s;tate equal to &s;ome of the No|bility; yet he his Ma&s;ter of more of the&s;e Superiorities, as they are called there, than many of tho&s;e who have twice his E&s;tate; and I have been told, that he can bring a Body of above 6000 Men together in Arms at a very little Warn|ing.</P>
<P>The Pomp and State in which this no|ble Per&s;on lives, is not to be imitated in Great Britain; for he is &s;erved like a Prince, and maintains a greater Equipage and Re|tinue than five Times his E&s;tate would &s;upport in another Country.</P>
<P>The Duke has al&s;o another Seat in S$rathe$n, which is called Tullibardin, and which gives Title at this Time to the elde&s;t Son of the Hou&s;e of Athol, for the Time being. At the lower Part of this Country, the River Earn falls into Tay, and greatly increa&s;es its Waters. This River ri&s;es far We&s;t, on the Fron|tiers of the We&s;tern Highlands near Glen|gyl, and running through that plea&s;ant Country called Strathearn, falls into Tay, below St. John&s;tons.</P>
<P>Soon after its fir&s;t Coming out from the Mountains, the Ea$n &s;preads it &s;elf into a Loch, as mo&s;t of tho&s;e Rivers
<PB REF="556">
do, this is called Loch Earn, &s;oon after which it runs by Duplin Ca&s;tle, the Seat of the Earl of Kinnowl, who&s;e Elde&s;t Son is known in England, by the Title of Lord Duplin, taking it from the Name of this Ca&s;tle. The late Earl of Kin|nowl's Son, the Lord Duplin, was mar|ryed to the Daughter of the late Earl of Oxford, then Lord High Trea&s;urer of England, and who was on that Occa&s;ion made a Peer of Great Britain.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;tle of Duplin, is a very beauti|ful Seat, and the Heads of the Families having been pretty much u&s;ed to live at home, the Hou&s;e has been adorned at &s;everal times, according to the Genius, and particular Inclination of the Per&s;ons, who then lived there; the pre&s;ent Earl is not much in Scotland; being created a Peer of Great Britain, in the Reign of the late Queen Anne, and marry'd, as above, into the Family of Oxford.</P>
<P>This ancient Seat is &s;ituated in a good Soil, and a plea&s;ant Country, near the Banks of the River Earn, and the Earl has a very good E&s;tate; but not loaded with Va&s;&s;als, and Highland Superiorities, as the Duke of Athol is &s;aid to be.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e is now under a new De|coration, two new Wings being lately ad|ded for Offices as well as Ornament.</P>
<P>The old Building is Spacious, the Rooms are large, and the Ciclings lofty, and which is more than all the Appearance of the Buildings, 'tis all magnificently fini&s;hed, and furni&s;hed within; there are al&s;o Abun|dance of very fine Paintings, and &s;ome of great Value, e&s;pecially Court Pieces, and Family Pieces, of which it would take up a Book to write the Particu|lars; but I mu&s;t not omit the fine Picture of King Charles the Fir&s;t, with a Letter in his Hand, which he holds out to his Son the Duke of York, afterwards King James the Second, which they &s;ay he was to carry to France; al&s;o a Statue in Bra&s;s of the &s;ame King Charles the Fir&s;t on Hor&s;eback; there are al&s;o two Pictures of a contrary &s;ort, Namely, one of Oliver Cromwell, and one of the then General Monk, both from the life.</P>
<P>Al&s;o there is a whole Length of that Earl of Kinnoul, who was Lord Chancel|lor of Scotland, in the Reign of King James the Sixth, with &s;everal other peices of Italian Ma&s;ters of great Value.</P>
<P>From this place we went to Brechin, an ancient Town with a Ca&s;tle finely &s;ituate; but the ancient Grandour of it not &s;up|ported; the Family of Penmure, to $word$ it belonged, having been in no extraordi|nary Circum&s;tances for &s;ome time pa&s;t, and now their Misfortunes being fini&s;hed, it is under Forfeiture, and &s;old among the Spoils of the late Rebellion.</P>
<P>We were now as it were landed again, being after a long Mountain-Ramble, come down to the Low Lands, and into a Plea|&s;ant and Agreeable Country; but as we had yet another Journey to take We&s;t, we had a like pro&s;pect of a rude and wild Part of Scotland to go through.</P>
<P>The Highlands of Scotland are divided into two Parts, and known &s;o as to &s;epar|ate Countries, (viz.) the We&s;t Highlands, and the North Highlands; the la&s;t, of which I have &s;poken at large, contain the Countries or Provinces of

<P>On the Bank of this River Earn lies a very plea&s;ant Vale, which continues from the Tay, where it receives the River quite up to the Highlands; this is called ac|cording,
<PB REF="557">
to the U&s;age of Scotland Strath Earn, or the Strath or Vale of Earn, 'tis an agreeable Country; and has many Gen|tlemens Seats on both Sides the River; but it is near the Highlands, and has often &s;uffered by the Depredations of tho&s;e wild Folk in former Times.</P>
<P>The Family of Montro&s;s, who&s;e Chief was &s;acrificed for the Intere&s;t of King Charles the Fir&s;t, had a &s;trong Ca&s;tle here called Kincardin; but it was ruined and demoli&s;hed in tho&s;e Wars, and is not re|built. The Ca&s;tle of Drummond is al|mo&s;t in the &s;ame Condition, or at lea&s;t is like &s;oon to be &s;o, the Earl of Perth, to whom it belongs, being in Exile, as his Father was before him, by their Adhering to the late King James the Seventh, and to the pre&s;ent Pretender King James the Seventh, made the Father a Duke, and Knight of the Garter, and Governor to his Son the Pretender. His Elde&s;t Son who &s;hould have &s;ucceeded to the Hon|ours and Titles dyed in France, and three other Sons &s;till remaining are all abroad, either following the ruined Fortunes of the Pretender, or in other Service in Fo|reign Courts; where, we know not, nor is it material to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The We&s;tern Highlands are the only remaining Part of Scotland, which as yet I have not toucht upon. This is that Par|ticular Country, which a late great Man in King James the Second's Time, called the Kingdom of Argyle; and upon which Occa&s;ion it was a Compliment upon King James, that he had conquered two Kings, when he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the Rebellion of the Whigs; namely, the Duke of Monmouth, whom in Deri&s;ion they called the little King of Lime, and the Earl of Argyle whom they called with much more Pro|$riety, the great King of the Highlands.</P>
<P>It is true that the greate&s;t Part of the&s;e $e&s;tern Highlands, may be &s;aid to be $bject, or in &s;ome Re&s;pect to belong to $e Hou&s;e of Argyle, or to &s;peake more $operly, to the Family or Clan of the Campbells, of whom the Duke of Argyle is the Chief; but then it &s;hould be no$ed too, that tho&s;e We&s;tern Gentlemen are not &s;o blindly to be led, or guided by their Chiefs as tho&s;e in the North; nor when led on, are they &s;o apt for Mi&s;chief and Violence. But as many of them are toucht with the Cameronian Whig, or at lea&s;t the Engli&s;h Whig Principles, they would venture to enquire what they were to do, and whom to fight again&s;t, at lea&s;t before they dipt far in any hazardous Un|dertaking.</P>
<P>Though the People of the&s;e Countries are &s;omething more civiliz'd than tho&s;e of their Bretheren Mountaineers in the North; yet the Countries &s;eem to be near a kin that no Strangers could know them alunder, nor is there any Breach in the Similitude that I could ob&s;erve, except it be that in the North Highlands, there are &s;uch great Woods of Fir Trees, which I have taken Notice of there, and which we do not &s;ee the like of here: Nor did we &s;ee &s;o many or &s;o large Eagles in the&s;e We&s;tern Mountins as in the North, tho' the People a&s;&s;ure us there are &s;uch too.</P>
<P>The Quantity of Deer are much the &s;ame&punc; and the Kinds to, and the black Cattle are of the &s;ame $span$ rather more numerous; the Pe$$le $word$ dre&s;s af|ter the &s;ame manner, in the Plaid and the Troule, go naked from below the Knee to the mid Thighs, wear the Du$k and the Pi&s;tol at their Girdle, and the Targ or Tar|get at their Shoulder.</P>
<P>Some reckon the Shire of Braidalbin to belong to the&s;e We&s;tern Highlands, not that it is We&s;t in its Situation, for it is ra|ther North, and as I have mention'd, is &s;aid to be the Center of Scotland; and the highe&s;t Land, being in the very Body of tho&s;e they call the Grampion Mountains; all the Rea&s;on that I could find they give for reconkoning this Country among the We&s;tern Highlands, is becau&s;e they &s;ay one Part of it is inhabited by the Camp|bels, who&s;e Clan, as I have ob&s;erved,
<PB REF="558">
generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the We&s;t High|lands.</P>
<P>But if they will claim the Country, they mu&s;t claim the People too, who are, if I may give my Opinion, &s;ome of the wor&s;t, mo&s;t barbarous, and ill governed of all their Highlands of Scotland, they are de&s;perate in Fight, cruel in Victory, fierce even in Conver&s;ation, apt to Quar|rel, mi&s;chievous, and even Murderers in their Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the Fight which happen'd at Gil|lekranky, in this Part of Scotland, they tell us a Story of a Combate between an Engli&s;h Soldier pre&s;s'd hard by a Highlander, the Regiment being in Di&s;|order, for the Engli&s;h had the wor&s;t of it; the Engli&s;h Soldier was &s;ingled out in the Pur&s;uit by one particular High|lander, and found him&s;elf in great Dan|ger, he defended him&s;elf with the Club of his Mu&s;quet as long as he was able, his Shot being &s;pent before, after which they came to their Swor$s, the Engli&s;h-Man under&s;tood the Back&s;word very well, but the Scots-Man received all the Blows upon his Targe; &s;o that the Engli&s;h-Man could not come in with him, and at the &s;ame time he lay'd hard at the Eng|li&s;h-Man with his Broad&s;word, and had had Cut him in two or three Places, at which the Engli&s;h Man enraged, rather than di&s;couraged, cryed out to him, <HI>you Dog,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>come from behind the Dovr, and fight like a Man,</HI> meaning from behind his great Target; but the Scots-Man tho' as brave as the other, knew better Things than that, and lay|ing hard at him cut him down, and was ju&s;t going to kill him, when &s;ome of the regiment that &s;aw him Di&s;tre&s;t, came up to him, and re&s;cu'd him, and took the Highlander Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>It is hard to di&s;tingui&s;h too among tho&s;e Highland-Men, who are the be&s;t Soldiers, Foreigners give it to the Nor|thern Men as the more hardy and the larger Bodies; but I will not undertake to decide to this $word$ either of them make very good Soldiers, and all the World are fond of them; nor are they equalled in any part of the World that I have met with, if they are regi|mented by them&s;elves, unmixt with other Nations.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t take an Opportunity to rectify a Mi&s;take which has grown up to a vulgar Error, and is an injury to the Scots, in &s;ome Re&s;pect, at lea&s;t it is rebbing them of that Honour, which is their due, the Ca&s;e is this;</P>
<P>We have frequent Occa&s;ions to hear of the Fame of the Iri&s;h Battallions Abroad, how well they behave, and what good Troops they are, how they acted $word$ &s;uch a Bartle, and &s;uch; how in parti|cular they beat the Germans out of Cremona, after they had got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town, and had taken the $word$ General, the Mar&s;hal Viller$y $word$ How the Iri&s;h Battalions in the Scots Service behaved in S$cily, and &s;o on $a|no extraordinary Occa&s;ions. Now though it is true that the&s;e are called $$i&s;h, be|cau&s;e they were Originally &s;uch; yet 'tis as true the Men are all or mo&s;t of them Scots Highlanders, who upon all Occa&s;ions getting over into France, al|ways Li&s;t in the Iri&s;h Troops: Nay in the late Wars it was frequent to rai&s;e whole Regiments of Highlanders for the Service, but when they came over, they would take the fir&s;t occa&s;ion to de&s;ert, and go over to the French, &s;o to li&s;t in the Iri&s;h Battalions, for they all &s;peak Iri&s;h, and &s;ome have affirmed, that they have fir&s;t li&s;ted with that Re&s;olution: being generally addicted to the intere&s;t of King James the Seventh; but be that &s;o or not, this I am well a&s;&s;ured of (viz) that mo&s;t of tho&s;e they call Iri&s;h in the Ar|mies of France and Spain and to wh$m &s;o many glorious Actions have been ju&s;tly a&s;$rib'd, are to this Day Scots H$ land|ers, or at lea&s;t, mo&s;t of them are &s;o, but this by the Way.</P>
<P><PB REF="559">
$span$ to our Progre&s;s. $span$ of Brechin, and $span$ Streathearn, we went $word$ We&s;t; but were pre&s;ently $word$ by a va&s;t inland Sea, rather than a Lake called Loch Lomond. It is in|deed a Sea, and look'd like it from the Hills from whence we fir&s;t de&s;cry'd it and its being a tempe&s;tuous Day, I a&s;&s;ure you it appeared all in a Breach, rough and raging, like the Sea in a Storm. There are &s;everal I&s;lands in it, which from the Hills we could plainly perceive were I&s;lands, but that they are a-drift, and float about the Lake, that I take as I find it, for a Story, namely, a Story call'd a F&mdash;as I do al&s;o that of the Water of this Loch, turning Wood into Stone.</P>
<P>This Lake or Loch is, without Com|pari&s;on, the greate&s;t in Scotland, no other can be called half &s;o big; for it is more than twenty Miles long, and generally eight Miles in Breadth, though at the North End of it, 'tis not &s;o broad by far. It receives many Rivers into it, but empties it&s;elf into the&punc; Firth of Clyde, at one Mouth; near the Entrance of it into Clyde, &s;tands the famous Dunbar|ton Ca&s;tle, the mo&s;t antient, as well as the mo&s;t important Ca&s;tle in Scotland; and the Gate, as 'tis called, of the High|lands. It is now not much regarded, the the whole Country being, at it were, bu|ried in Peace, yet there is a Garri&s;on maintain'd in it; and the Pa&s;s would be $span$ great Import, were there any Oc|ca&s;ion of Arms in Time to come; 'tis exceeding &s;trong by Situation, being &s;e|cured by the River on one Side the Firth, of Clyde on the other by an un|pa&s;&s;able Mora&s;s, on the third Side, and the fourth is a Precipice.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing from Dunbarton Ca&s;tle, we en|ter the Territory of Argyle. As to the County of Lenox, the paternal E&s;tate and Property of the Stuarts, it lyes ex|tended from both &s;ides the Levin, that is, the River, which (as I &s;aid before) empties the Loch-Lomon into the Clyde. On this Side, or Ea&s;tward, joins to Mon|teith, and runs up for &s;ome Length on the Ea&s;t Side of the Loch, and on the We&s;t Side it extends to the Edge of the Loch Loing, and a great Way North, almo&s;t to the Mountains of Loquha|bre.</P>
<P>All our Writers of the De&s;cription of Lenox enlarge upon the Family of Stuarts, who proceeded, as by the Mother, from the Royal Line of Scotland: So by the Father, from Henry Lord Darnley&punc; mar|ry'd to Queen of Scots, and afterwards ba&s;ely murder'd by her, or by her Order and Direction.</P>
<P>By this Lord Darnley, who was Son and Heir apparent to Matthew Earl of Lenox, this whole E&s;tate, with the Ti|tle, devolv'd at la&s;t upon K. Charles II. who gave the Title to one of his Natu|ral Sons, with the Addition of Duke.</P>
<P>Beyond this Loch-Loing begins the large extended Country of Argyle, or the We&s;tern Highlands, who&s;e Extent takes in the Shire or County of Lorn to the North, and Cantyre $o the South, all po&s;|&s;e&s;$'d by the Campbell's, and vulgarly under&s;tood by the Country of Argyle; for as for Cantyre, which is a Cher&s;one&s;e, or Penin&s;ula, it belongs mo&s;tly, if not wholly to the Campbell's; and as to Lorn, 'tis the Title of the elde&s;t Son of the Hou&s;e of Argyle to this Day.</P>
<P>The We&s;t &s;ide of this Country lies ex|tended along the Iri&s;h Sea for a very great Length at lea&s;t Eighty Miles. On all this &s;hore there there is no Town emi|nent for Trade, no Port or Harbour, at lea&s;t none made u&s;e of for Shipping, nor are there any Ships to require them, ex|cept Fi&s;hing-Barks and Boats, which are in the Sea&s;on employed for catching Her|rings, of which the Shoals that are found upon thfs Coa&s;t in the Sea&s;on are incre|dible, e&s;pecially in the Clyde, in Loch-Finn, and about the I&s;le of Arran, which lyes in the Mouth of Clyde.</P>
<P>From the Mull of Cantyre they &s;ee Ireland very plain, it being not above fifteen

or &s;ixteen Miles from the Point of Land, which they call the Mull to the Fair Foreland; on the Coa&s;t of Colrain&punc; on the North of Ireland&punc; In the Mouth of this Sea of Clyde lyes a Rock, &s;ome|what like the Ba&s;s in the Firth of Forth, or of Edinbugh, not for Shape, but for this Particular, that here, as at the Ba&s;s, the Soland Gee&s;e are plea&s;ed to come in the Sea&s;on of the Fi&s;hery, and to breed and inhabit as they do at the Ba&s;s, and to go away and come again ju&s;t at the &s;ame Sea&s;ons, as at the Ba&s;s: This I&s;land is called the Ailze. Here are al&s;o the I&s;lands of Arran and of Bute; the fir&s;t giving Title of Earl to the Family of Hamilton, and the other the Title of Duke of Roth|&s;ay to the elde&s;t Son of the Crown of Scotland, who is called Duke of Roth|&s;ay, from the Ca&s;tle of Roth&s;ay in this I&s;land; nor is there $span$ to be &s;aid of $span$ for as for their pre&s;ent Condition, $span$ is what is my particular Bu&s;ine&s;s in $$is Book, they have nothing con&s;iderable $word$ or about them, except it be a tumultuous and dangerous Sea for Sailors, e&s;pecially when a South We&s;t Wind blows hard, which brings the Sea rowling in upon them in a frightful Manner. However, there is one good Harbour on the North Side of the I&s;land, called Lamlach, which is their Safety in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Off of the We&s;tern Shore of Argyle and Lorn there are Abundance of I&s;lands, which all belong to the Family of Ar|gyle, or at lea&s;t to its Juri&s;diction&punc; as I&s;ta, Jura, Tyrry, Mull, Ly&s;more, Coll, and &s;everal others of le&s;s Note.</P>
