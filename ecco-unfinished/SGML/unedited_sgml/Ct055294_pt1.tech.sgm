<HEAD>TO
DOCTOR ******</HEAD>
<P>YOU and I, my good friend, have
often deliberated on the difficulty of
writing &s;uch a Dedication as might
gratify the &s;elf-complacency of a patron,
without expo&s;ing the author to the ridicule
or cen&s;ure of the public; and I think we
generally agreed that the ta&s;k was altogether
impracticable.&mdash;Indeed, this was one of the
few &s;ubjects on which we have always
thought in the &s;ame manner: for notwith|&s;tanding
that deference and regard which
we mutually pay to each other, certain it
is, we have often differed, according to the
predominancy of tho&s;e different pa&s;&s;ions,
which frequently warp the opinion, and
perplex the under&s;tanding of the mo&s;t ju|dicious.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="3">
In Dedication as in Poetry, there is no
medium: for, if any one of the human virtues
be omitted in the enumeration of the pa|tron's
good qualities; the whole addre&s;s is
con&s;trued into an affront, and the writer has
the mortification to find his prai&s;e pro&s;ti|tuted
to very little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;hould he yield to
the tran&s;ports of gratitude or affection which
is always apt to exaggerate, and produce
no more than the genuine effu&s;ions of his
heart, the world will make no allowance
for the warmth of his pa&s;&s;ion, but a&s;cribe
the prai&s;e he be&s;tows, to intere&s;ted views
and &s;ordid adulation.</P>
<P>Sometimes too, dazzled by the tin&s;el of
a character which he has no opportunity to
inve&s;tigate, he pours forth the homage of his
admiration, upon &s;ome fal&s;e Maecenas, who&s;e
future conduct gives the lie to his eulogi|um,
and involves him in &s;hame and con|fu&s;ion
of face. Such was the fate of a late
ingenious<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The author of the SEASONS.</NOTE> author, who was &s;o often put to
the blu&s;h for the unde&s;erved incen&s;e he had
offered, in the heat of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic di&s;po|&s;ition,
mi&s;led by popular applau&s;e, that he
had re&s;olved to retract in his la&s;t will, all
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
the encomiums which he had thus prema|turely
be&s;towed, and &s;tigmatize the unwor|thy
by name: a laudable &s;cheme of poeti|cal
ju&s;tice, the execution of which was fa|tally
prevented by untimely death.</P>
<P>Whatever may have been the &s;ate of other
Dedicators, I, for my own part, &s;it down
to write this addre&s;s, without any apprehen|&s;ion
of di&s;grace or di&s;appointment; becau&s;e
I know you are too well convinced of my
affection and &s;incerity to repine at what I
&s;hall &s;ay touching your character and con|duct:
and you will do me the ju&s;tice to be|lieve,
that this public di&s;tinction is a te&s;|timony
of my particular friend&s;hip and
e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Not that I am either in&s;en&s;ible of your
infirmities, or di&s;po&s;ed to conceal them from
the notice of mankind. There are certain
foibles which can only be cured by &s;hame
and mortification; and whether or not yours
be of that &s;pecies, I &s;hall have the comfort
to think my be&s;t endeavours were u&s;ed for
your reformation.</P>
<P>Know then, I can de&s;pi&s;e your pride,
while I honour your integrity; and applaud
your ta&s;te, while I am &s;hocked at your
o&s;tentation.&mdash;I have known you trifling,
&s;uperficial and ob&s;tinate in di&s;pute; meanly
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
jealous and aukwardly re&s;erved; ra&s;h and
haughty in your re&s;entments; and coar&s;e and
lowly in your connexions.&mdash;I have blu&s;hed
at the weakne&s;s of your conver&s;ation, and
trembled at the errors of your conduct.&mdash;Yet,
as I own you po&s;&s;e&s;s certain good qua|lities,
which over-balance the&s;e defects, and
di&s;tingui&s;h you on this occa&s;ion, as a per&s;on
for whom I have the mo&s;t perfect attach|ment
and e&s;teem, you have no cau&s;e to
complain of the indelicacy with which your
faults are reprehended: and as they are
chiefly the exce&s;&s;es of a &s;anguine di&s;po&s;ition
and loo&s;ene&s;s of thought, impatient of cau|tion
or controul; you may, thus &s;timulated,
watch over your own intemperance and in|firmity,
with redoubled vigilance and con|&s;ideration,
and for the future profit by the
&s;everity of my reproof.</P>
<P>The&s;e, however, are not the only mo|tives
that induce me to trouble you with
this public application. I mu&s;t not only per|form
my duty to my friends, but al&s;o di&s;|charge
the debt I owe to my own intere&s;t.
We live in a cen&s;orious age; and an author
cannot take too much precaution to anti|cipate
the prejudice, mi&s;apprehen&s;ion and
temerity of malice, ignorance and pre&s;ump|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="6">
I therefore think it incumbent upon me,
to give &s;ome previous intimation of the
plan which I have executed in the &s;ub&s;e|quent
performance, that I may not be con|demned
upon partial evidence; and to
whom can I with more propriety appeal in
my explanation, than to you, who are &s;o well
acquainted with all the &s;entiments and emo|tions
of my brea&s;t?</P>
<P>A Novel is a large diffu&s;ed picture, com|prehending
the characters of life, di&s;po&s;ed
in different groupes, and exhibited in va|rious
attitudes, for the purpo&s;es of an uni|form
plan, and general occurrence, to
which every individual figure is &s;ub&s;ervient.
But this plan cannot be executed with pro|priety,
probability or &s;ucce&s;s, without a
principal per&s;onage to attract the attention,
unite the incidents, unwind the clue of the
labyrinth, and at la&s;t clo&s;e the &s;cene by
virtue of his own importance.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the heroes of this kind, who
have hitherto &s;ucceeded on the Engli&s;h
&s;tage, are characters of tran&s;cendent worth,
conducted through the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune,
to that goal of happine&s;s, which ever ought
to be the repo&s;e of extraordinary de&s;ert.&mdash;Yet
the &s;ame principle by which we rejoice
at the remuneration of merit, will teach us to
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
reli&s;h the di&s;grace and di&s;comfiture of vice,
which is always an example of exten&s;ive
u&s;e and in$luence, becau&s;e it leaves a deep
impre&s;&s;ion of terror upon the minds of
tho&s;e who were not confirmed in the pur|&s;uit
of morality and virtue, and while the
balance wavers, enables the right &s;cale to
preponderate.</P>
<P>In the Drama, which is a more limited
field of invention, the chief per&s;onage is
often the object of our dete&s;tation and ab|horrence;
and we are as well plea&s;ed to &s;ee
the wicked &s;chemes of a RICHARD bla&s;ted,
and the perfidy of a MASKWELL expo&s;ed,
as to behold a BEVIL happy, and an ED|WARD
victorious.</P>
<P>The impul&s;es of fear which is the mo&s;t
violent and intere&s;ting of all the pa&s;&s;ions,
remain longer than any other upon the
memory; and for one that is allured to vir|tue,
by the contemplation of that peace and
happine&s;s which it be&s;tows, an hundred
are deterred from the practice of vice, by
that infamy and puni&s;hment to which it is
liable, from the laws and regulations of
mankind.</P>
<P>Let me not therefore be condemned for
having cho&s;en my principal character from
the purlieus of treachery and fraud, when
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
I declare my purpo&s;e is to &s;et him up as a
beacon for the benefit of the unexperienced
and unwary, who from the peru&s;al of the&s;e
memoirs, may learn to avoid the manifold
&s;nares with which they are continually &s;ur|rounded
in the paths of life; while tho&s;e
who he&s;itate on the brink of iniquity, may
be terrified from plunging into that irreme|able
gulph, by &s;urveying the deplorable
fate of FERDINAND Count FATHOM.</P>
<P>That the mind might not be fatigued,
nor the imagination di&s;gu&s;ted by a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of vitious objects, I have endeavoured
to refre&s;h the attention with occa&s;ional inci|dents
of a different nature; and rai&s;ed up a
virtuous character, in oppo&s;ition to the ad|venturer,
with a view to amu&s;e the fancy,
engage the affection, and form a &s;triking
contra&s;t which might heighten the expre&s;|&s;ion,
and give a <HI>Relief</HI> to the moral of
the whole.</P>
<P>If I have not &s;ucceeded in my endeavours
to unfold the my&s;teries of fraud, to in&s;truct
the ignorant, and entertain the vacant; if I
have failed in my attempts to &s;ubject folly
to ridicule, and vice to indignation; to
rou&s;e the &s;pirit of mirth, wake the &s;oul of
compa&s;&s;ion, and touch the &s;ecret &s;prings
that move the heart; I have at lea&s;t, adorn|ed
virtue with honour and applau&s;e;
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
branded iniquity with reproach and &s;hame,
and carefully avoided every hint or expre&s;|&s;ion
which could give umbrage to the mo&s;t
delicate reader: circum&s;tances which (what|ever
may be my fate with the public) will
with you always operate in favour of</P>

OF
Ferdinand Count Fathom.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some &s;age ob&s;ervations that naturally introduce
our important hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>CARDINAL de Retz very judiciou&s;ly
ob&s;erves, that all hi&s;torians mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
be &s;ubject to mi&s;takes, in explain|ing
the motives of tho&s;e actions they record, un|le&s;s
they derive their intelligence from the can|did
confe&s;&s;ion of the per&s;on who&s;e character they
repre&s;ent; and that, of con&s;equence, every man
of importance ought to write his own memoirs,
provided he has hone&s;ty enough to tell the truth,
without &s;uppre&s;&s;ing any circum&s;tance, that may
tend to the information of the reader. This,
however, is a requi&s;ite that, I am afraid, would
<PB N="2" REF="11">
be very rarely found among the number of tho&s;e
who exhibit their own portraits to the public:
indeed, I will venture to &s;ay, that how upright
&s;oever a man's intentions may be, he will, in the
performance of &s;uch a ta&s;k, be &s;ometimes mi&s;led
by his own phanta&s;y, and repre&s;ent objects, as
they appeared to him, through the mi&s;ts of pre|judice
and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>An unconcerned reader, when he peru&s;es the
hi&s;tory of two competitors, who lived two thou|&s;and
years ago, or who, perhaps, never had ex|i&s;tence,
except in the imagination of the author,
cannot help intere&s;ting him&s;elf in the di&s;pute,
and e&s;pou&s;ing one &s;ide of the conte&s;t, with all
the zeal of a warm adherent. What wonder
then, that we &s;hould be heated in our own concerns,
review our actions with the &s;ame &s;elf-approba|tion
that they had formerly acquired, and re|commend
them to the world with all the en|thu&s;ia&s;m
of paternal affection?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing this to be the ca&s;e, it was lucky for
the cau&s;e of hi&s;torical truth, that &s;o many pens
have been drawn by writers, who could not
be &s;u&s;pected of &s;uch partiality; and that many
great per&s;onages, among the ancients as well as
moderns, either would not, or could not enter|tain
the public with their own memoirs. From
this want of inclination or capacity to write, in
our hero him&s;elf, the undertaking is now left
to me, of tran&s;mitting to po&s;terity, the remark|able
adventures of FERDINAND Count FATHOM;
and by that time the reader &s;hall have glanced
over the &s;ub&s;equent &s;heets, I doubt not, but he
will ble&s;s God, that the adventurer was not his
own hi&s;torian.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="12">
This mirrour of modern chivalry was none
of tho&s;e who owe their dignity to the circum|&s;tances
of their birth, and are con&s;ecrated from
the cradle for the purpo&s;es of greatne&s;s, meerly
becau&s;e they are the accidental children of
wealth. He was heir to no vi&s;ible patrimony,
unle&s;s we reckon a robu&s;t con&s;titution, a tolera|ble
appearance, and an uncommon capacity, as
the advantages of inheritance: if the compari&s;on
obtains in this point of con&s;ideration, he was as
much as any man, indebted to his parents; and
pity it was, that in the &s;equel of his fortune, he
never had an opportunity of manife&s;ting his
filial gratitude and regard. From this agreeable
act of duty to his &s;ire, and all tho&s;e tender|ne&s;&s;es
that are reciprocally enjoyed betwixt the
father and the &s;on, he was unhappily excluded
by a &s;mall circum&s;tance; at which, however, he
was never heard to repine. In &s;hort, had he
been brought forth in the fabulous ages of the
world, the nature of his origin might have turn|ed
to his account; he might, like other heroes
of antiquity, have laid claim to divine extrac|tion,
without running the ri&s;que of being claim|ed
by any earthly father; not that his parents
had any rea&s;on to di&s;own or renounce their off|&s;pring,
or that there was any thing preternatural
in the circum&s;tances of his generation and birth; on
the contrary, he was from the beginning, a child
of promi&s;ing parts, and in due cour&s;e of nature,
u&s;hered into the world, amid&s;t a whole cloud of
witne&s;&s;es: but, that he was acknowledged by no
mortal &s;ire, &s;olely proceeded from the uncertainty
of his mother, who&s;e affections were &s;o di&s;&s;ipated
among a number of admirers, that &s;he could
<PB N="4" REF="13">
never pitch upon the per&s;on from who&s;e loins
our hero &s;prung.</P>
<P>Over and above this important doubt, under
which he was begotten, other particularities at|tended
his birth, and &s;eemed to mark him out
as &s;omething uncommon among the &s;ons of men.
He was brought forth in a waggon, and might
be &s;aid to be literally a native of two different
countries; for, though he fir&s;t &s;aw the light in
Holland, he was not born till after the carriage
arrived in Flanders; &s;o that all the&s;e extraor|dinary
circum&s;tances con&s;idered, the ta&s;k of de|termining
to what government he naturally
owed allegiance, would be at lea&s;t as difficult,
as that of a&s;certaining the &s;o much conte&s;ted
birth-place of Homer.</P>
<P>Certain it is, the count's mother was an Eng|li&s;hwoman,
who, after having been five times
a widow in one campaign, was, in the la&s;t year
of the renowned Marlborough's command, num|bered
among the baggage of the allied army,
which &s;he &s;till accompanied, through pure bene|volence
of &s;pirit, &s;upplying the ranks with the
refre&s;hing &s;treams of choice geneva, and ac|commodating
individuals with clean linnen, as
the emergency of their occa&s;ions required: Nor
was her philanthropy altogether confined to &s;uch
mini&s;tration: &s;he abounded with &startq;the milk
of human kindne&s;s,&endq; which flowed plenti|fully
among her fellow-creatures; and to every
&s;on of Mars who cultivated her favour, &s;he libe|rally
di&s;pen&s;ed her &s;miles, in order to &s;weeten
the toils and dangers of the field.</P>
<P>And here it will not be ami&s;s to anticipate the
remarks of the reader, who, in the cha&s;tity and
excellency of his conception, may po&s;&s;ibly ex|claim,
<PB N="5" REF="14">
&startq;Good Heaven! will the&s;e authors never
reform their imaginations, and li&s;t their ideas
from the ob&s;cene objects of low life? Mu&s;t
the publick be again di&s;gu&s;ted with the grovel|ing
adventures of a waggon? Will no writer
of genius draw his pen in the vindication of
ta&s;te, and entertain us with the agreeable cha|racters,
the dignified conver&s;ation, the poignant
repartee, in &s;hort, the genteel comedy of the
polite world?&endq;</P>
<P>Have a little patience, gentle, delicate, &s;ub|lime,
critic; you, I doubt not, are one of tho&s;e
con&s;ummate connoi&s;&s;eurs, who in their purifica|tions,
let humour evaporate, while they endea|vour
to pre&s;erve decorum, and poli&s;h wit, until
the edge of it is quite wore off: or, perhaps of
that cla&s;s, who, in the &s;apience of ta&s;te, are
di&s;gu&s;ted with tho&s;e very flavours, in the produc|tions
of their own country, which have yielded
infinite delectation to their faculties, when im|ported
from another clime; and damn an author
in de&s;pite of all precedent and pre&s;cription;
who extol the writings of Petronius Arbiter,
read with rapture the amorous fallies of Ovid's
pen, and chuckle over the &s;tory of Lucian's
a&s;s; yet, if a modern author pre&s;umes to relate
the progre&s;s of a &s;imple intrigue, are &s;hocked at
the indecency and immorality of the &s;cene: who
delight in following Guzman d'Alfarache, thro'
all the mazes of &s;qualid beggary; who with
plea&s;ure accompany Don Quixote and his &s;quire,
in the lowe&s;t paths of fortune; who are diverted
with the adventures of Scarron's ragged troop
of &s;trollers, and highly entertained with the &s;er|vile
&s;ituations of Gil Blas; yet, when a cha|racter
in humble life occa&s;ionally occurs in a
<PB N="6" REF="15">
performance of our own growth, exclaim with
an air of di&s;gu&s;t, &startq;Was ever any thing &s;o
mean! Sure, this writer mu&s;t have been very
conver&s;ant with the lowe&s;t &s;cenes of life:&endq; who,
when Swift or Pope repre&s;ents a coxcomb in
the act of &s;wearing, &s;cruple not to laugh at the
ridiculous execrations; but in a le&s;s reputed au|thor,
condemn the u&s;e of &s;uch profane ex|pletives:
who eagerly explore the jakes of Ra|be$ais,
for amu&s;ement, and even extract hu|mour
from the dean's de&s;cription of a lady's
dre&s;&s;ing-room: yet, in a production of the&s;e
days, un&s;tampt with &s;uch venerable names, will
&s;top their no&s;es with all the &s;igns of loathing and
abhorrence, at a bare mention of the china cham|ber-pot:
who applaud Catullus, Juvenal, Per|&s;ius
and Lucan, for their &s;pirit in la&s;hing the
greate&s;t names of antiquity; yet, when a Briti&s;h
fatiri&s;t, of this generation, has courage enough
to call in que&s;tion the talents of a P&s;eudo-pa|tron,
in power, accu&s;e him of in&s;olence, ran|cour
and &s;currility.</P>
<P>If &s;uch you be, courteous reader, I &s;ay again,

convenient di&s;patch, be gradually &s;ublimed, into
tho&s;e &s;plendid connexions of which you are ena|moured;
and God forbid, that in the mean
time, the nature of his extraction &s;hould turn
to his prejudice, in a land of freedom like this,
where individuals are every day ennobled in
con&s;equence of their own qualifications, with|out
the lea&s;t retro&s;pective regard to the rank or
merit of their ance&s;tors. Yes, refined reader,
we are ha&s;tening to that goal of perfection,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A &s;uperficial view of our hero's infancy.</HEAD>
<P>HAving thus be&s;poke the indulgence of our
gue&s;ts, let us now produce the particulars
of our entertainment, and &s;peedily conduct our
adventurer through the &s;tage of infancy, which
&s;eldom teems with intere&s;ting incidents.</P>
<P>As the occupations of his mother would not
conveniently permit her to &s;uckle this her fir&s;t-born
at her own brea&s;t, and tho&s;e happy ages
were now no more, in which the charge of
nur&s;ing a child might be le&s;t to the next goat
or &s;he-wolf, &s;he re&s;olved to improve upon the
ordinances of nature, and fo&s;ter him with a
juice much more ene$gic than the milk of goat,
or wolf, or woman; this was no other than that
delicious nectar, which, as we have already
hinted, &s;he &s;o cordially di&s;tributed from a &s;mall
ca&s;k that hung before her, depending from her
&s;houlders by a leathern zone. Thus determined,
'ere he was yet twelve days old, &s;he enclo&s;ed
him in a canvas knap&s;ack, which being adju&s;ted
<PB N="8" REF="17">
to her neck, &s;ell down upon her back, and bal|lanced
the cargo that re&s;ted on her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>There are not wanting tho&s;e who affirm,
that while her double charge was carried about
in this &s;ituation, her cag was furni&s;hed with a
long and &s;lender flexible tube, which, when the
child began to be clamorous, &s;he conveyed into
his mouth, and &s;trait he &s;tilled him&s;elf with &s;uck|ing;
but this we con&s;ider as an extravagant
a&s;&s;ertion of tho&s;e, who mix the marvellous in
all their narrations, becau&s;e we cannot conceive
how the tender organs of an infant, could dige&s;t
&s;uch a fiery beverage, which never fails to di&s;|compo&s;e
the con&s;titutions of the mo&s;t hardy and
robu&s;t: we therefore conclude, that the u&s;e of
this potation was more re&s;trained, and that it
was with &s;imple element, diluted into a compo|&s;ition
adapted to his ta&s;te and years. Be this
as it will, he certainly was indulged in the u&s;e of
it to &s;uch a degree, as would have effectually
ob&s;tructed his future fortune, had not he been
happily cloyed with the repetition of the &s;ame
fare, for which he conceived the utmo&s;t dete&s;|tation
and abhorrence, rejecting it with loath|ing
and di&s;gu&s;t, like tho&s;e choice &s;pirits, who,
having been crammed with religion in their
childhood, renounce it in their youth, among
other ab&s;urd prejudices of education.</P>
<P>While he thus dangled in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion,
a German trooper was tran&s;iently &s;mit
with the charms of his mother, who li&s;tened to
his honourable addre&s;&s;es, and once more received
the &s;ilken bonds of matrimony; the ceremony
having been performed as u&s;ual at the drum-head.
The lady had no &s;ooner taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her new
name, than &s;he be&s;towed it upon her &s;on, who
<PB N="9" REF="18">
was thenceforward di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appella|tion
of Ferdinand de Fadom; nor was the hu&s;|band
offended at this pre&s;umption in his wife,
which he not only con&s;idered as a proof of her
affection and e&s;teem, but al&s;o as a compliment,
by which he might in time acquire the credit
of being the real father of &s;uch an hopeful
child.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this new engagement with
a foreigner, our Hero's mother &s;till exerci&s;ed the
virtues of her calling among the Engli&s;h troops,
&s;o much was &s;he bla&s;&s;ed by that laudable par|tiality,
which, as Horace ob&s;erves, the <HI>natale
&s;olum</HI> generally in&s;pires: indeed this inclination
was enforced by another rea&s;on, that did not
fail to influence her conduct in this particular;
all her knowledge of the high Dutch language
con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome words of traffic, ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary for the practice of her vocation; to|gether
with &s;undry oaths and terms of reproach,
that kept her cu&s;tomers in awe; &s;o that, except
among her own countrymen, &s;he could not in|dulge
that propen&s;ity to conver&s;ation, for which
&s;he had been remarkable from her earlie&s;t years.
Nor did this in&s;tance of her affection fail of
turning to her account in the &s;equel: She was
promoted to the office of cook to a regimental
me&s;s of officers; and before the peace of Utrecht,
was actually in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;uttling-tent,
pitched for the accommodation of the gentle|men
in the army.</P>
<P>Mean while, Ferdinand improved apace in
the accompli&s;hments of infancy; his beauty was
con&s;picuous, and his vigour &s;o uncommon, that
he was with ju&s;tice likened unto Hercules in the
cradle: the friends of his father-in-law, dandled
<PB N="10" REF="19">
him on their knees, while he played with their
whi&s;kers, and before he was thirteen months old,
taught him to &s;uck brandy impregnated with
gun-powder, through the touch-hole of a pi&s;tol.
At the &s;ame time, he was care&s;&s;ed by divers &s;er|jeants
of the Briti&s;h army, who &s;everally and
in &s;ecret contemplated his qualifications with a
father's pride, excited by the artful declara|tion,
with which the mother had flattered each
apart.</P>
<P>Soon as the war was (for her unhappily) con|cluded,
&s;he, as in duty bound, followed her hus|band
into Bohemia; and his regiment being &s;ent
into garri&s;on at Prague, &s;he opened a cabaret
in that city, which was frequented by a good
many gue&s;ts of the Scotch and Iri&s;h nations,
who were devoted to the exerci&s;e of arms, in
the &s;ervice of the emperor. It was by this
communication, that the Engli&s;h tongue became
vernacular to young Ferdinand, who, without
&s;uch opportunity, would have been a &s;tranger to
the language of his forefathers, in &s;pite of all
his mother's loquacity and elocution: though it
mu&s;t be owned, for the credit of her maternal
care, that &s;he let &s;lip no occa&s;ion of making it
familiar to his ear and conception; for, even at
tho&s;e intervals in which &s;he could find no per|&s;on
to carry on the altercation, &s;he u&s;ed to hold
forth in earne&s;t &s;oliloquies upon the &s;ubject of
her own &s;ituation, giving vent to many oppro|brious
invectives again&s;t her hu&s;band's country,
between which and old England &s;he drew many
odious compari&s;ons; and prayed without cea&s;ing
that Europe might &s;peedily be involved in a ge|neral
war, &s;o as that &s;he might have &s;ome chance

<P>WHile &s;he wearied Heaven with the&s;e peti|tions,
the flame of war broke out be|twixt
the hou&s;es of Ottoman and Au&s;tria, and
the emperor &s;ent forth an army into Hungary,
under the au&s;pices of the renowned prince Eu|gene.
On account of this expedition, the mother
of our hero gave up hou&s;e-keeping, and chear|fully
followed her cu&s;tomers and husband into
the field; having fir&s;t provided her&s;elf with &s;tore
of tho&s;e commodities, in which &s;he had for|merly
merchandized. Although the hope of pro|fit
might in &s;ome mea&s;ure affect her determina|tion,
one of the chief motives for her vi&s;iting
the frontiers of Turkey, was the de&s;ire of ini|tiating
her &s;on in the rudiments of his education,
which &s;he now thought high time to inculcate,
he being, at this period, in the &s;ixth year of his
age; he was ac$ordingly conducted to the camp,
which &s;he con&s;idered as the mo&s;t con&s;ummate
&s;chool of life, and propo&s;ed for the &s;cene of his
in&s;truction; and in this academy he had not
continued many weeks, when he was an eye|witne&s;s
of that famous victory, which, with
&s;ixty thou&s;and men, the imperial general ob|tained
over an army of one hundred and fifty
thou&s;and Turks.</P>
<P>His father in law was engaged, and his mo|ther
would not be idle on this occa&s;ion: &s;he
<PB N="12" REF="21">
was a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of all the camp qualifica|tions,
and thought it a duty incumbent on her,
to contribute all that lay in her power, towards
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the enemy: with the&s;e &s;entiments,
&s;he hovered about the &s;kirts of the army, and
the troops were no &s;ooner employed in the pur|&s;uit,
than &s;he began to traver&s;e the field of bat|tle
with a poignard and a bag, in order to
con&s;ult her own intere&s;t, annoy the foe, and
exerci&s;e her humanity at the &s;ame time. In
&s;hort, &s;he had with amazing prowe&s;s, delivered
&s;ome fifty or three&s;core di&s;abled mu$fulmen of
the pain under which they groaned, and made
a comfortable booty of the &s;poils of the &s;lain,
when her eyes were attracted by the rich attire
of an imperial officer, who lay bleeding on
the plain, to all appearance in the agonies of
death.</P>
<P>She could not, in her heart, refu&s;e that favour
to a friend and chri&s;tian, &s;he had &s;o compa&s;&s;ion|ately
be&s;towed upon &s;o many enemies and infi|dels,
and therefore drew near with the &s;overeign
remedy, which &s;he had already admini&s;tred with
&s;uch &s;ucce&s;s. As &s;he approached this deplorable
object of pity, her ears were &s;urprized with an
ejaculation in the Engli&s;h tongue, which he fer|vently
pronounced, though with a weak and
languid voice, recommending his &s;oul to God,
and his family to the protection of Heaven.
Our amazon's purpo&s;e was &s;taggered by this pro|vidential
incident; the &s;ound of her native lan|guage,
&s;o unexpectedly heard, and &s;o patheti|cally
delivered, had a &s;urpri&s;ing effect upon her
imagination; and the faculty of reflexion did
not for&s;ake her in &s;uch emergency: though &s;he
could not recollect the features of this unhappy
<PB N="13" REF="22">
officer, &s;he concluded from his appearance, that
he was &s;ome per&s;on of di&s;tinction in the &s;ervice,
and fore&s;aw greater advantage to her&s;elf in at|tempting
to pre&s;erve his life, than &s;he could po&s;&s;i|bly
reap from the execution of her fir&s;t re&s;olve.
&startq;If (&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf) I can find means of
conveying him to his tent, alive, he cannot but
in con&s;cience acknowledge my humanity with
&s;ome con&s;iderable recompence; and &s;hould he
chance to &s;urvive his wounds, I have every
thing to expect from his gratitude and power.&endq;</P>
<P>Fraught with the&s;e prudential &s;ugge&s;tions, &s;he
drew near the unfortunate &s;tranger, and in a
&s;oftened accent of pity and condolance, que&s;tion|ed
him concerning his name, condition, and the
nature of his mi&s;chance, at the &s;ame time mak|ing
a gentle tender of her &s;ervice. Agreeably
&s;urprized to hear him&s;elf acco&s;ted in &s;uch a man|ner,
by a per&s;on who&s;e equipage &s;eemed to
promi&s;e far other de&s;igns, he thanked her in the
mo&s;t grateful terms for her humanity, with the
appellation of kind countrywoman; gave her to
under&s;tand that he was colonel of a regiment of
hor&s;e; that he had fallen in con&s;equence of a
&s;hot he received in his brea&s;t, at the beginning
of the action; and finally intreated her to pro|cure
&s;ome carriage on which he might be re|moved
to his tent. Perceiving him faint and
exhau&s;ted with lo&s;s of blood, &s;he rai&s;ed up his
head, and treated him with that cordial which
was her con&s;tant companion: at that in&s;tant,
e&s;pying a &s;mall body of hu&s;&s;ars returning to the
camp with the plunder they had taken, &s;he in|voked
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and they forthwith carried
the officer to his own quarters, where his wound
<PB N="14" REF="23">
was dre&s;&s;ed, and his pre&s;erver carefully tended
him until his recovery was compleated.</P>
<P>In return for the&s;e good offices, this gentle|man,
who was originally of Scotland, rewarded
her for the pre&s;ent, with great liberality, a&s;&s;ured
her of his influence in promoting her husband,
and took upon him&s;elf the charge of young
Ferdinand's education; the boy was immediately
taken into his protection, and entered as a
trooper in his own regiment; but his good in|tentions
towards his father-in-law, were fru&s;trat|ed
by the death of the German, who in a few
days after this di&s;po&s;ition, was &s;hot in the
trenches before Temi&s;waer.</P>
<P>This event, over and above the conjugal af|fliction
with which it invaded the lady's quiet,
would have involved her in infinite difficulty and
di&s;tre&s;s, with regard to her temporal concerns,
by leaving her unprotected in the mid&s;t of
&s;trangers, had not &s;he been thus providentially
&s;upplied, with an effectual patron in the colonel,
who was known by the appellation of count
Melvil. He no &s;ooner &s;aw her, by the death of
her husband, detached from all per&s;onal con|nexions
with a military life, than he propo&s;ed
that &s;he &s;hould quit her occupation in the camp,
and retire to his habitation in the city of Pre&s;|burg,
where &s;he would be entertained in ca&s;e
and plenty, during the remaining part of her
natural life: with all due acknowledgments of
his genero&s;ity, &s;he begged to be excu&s;ed from
embracing his propo&s;al, alledging &s;he was &s;o
much accu&s;tomed to her pre&s;ent way of life,
and &s;o much devoted to the &s;ervice of the &s;ol|diery,
that &s;he &s;hould never be happy in retire|ment,
<PB N="15" REF="24">
while the troops of any prince of Chri&s;|tendom

<P>The count finding her determined to pro&s;e|cute
her &s;cheme, repeated his promi&s;e of be|friending
her upon all occa&s;ions; and in the mean
time, admitted Ferdinand into the number of
his dome&s;tics, re&s;olving that he &s;hould be brought
up in attendance upon his own &s;on, who was a
boy of the &s;ame age. He kept him, however,
in his tent, until he &s;hould have an opportunity
of revi&s;iting his family in per&s;on; and before
that occa&s;ion offered, two whole years elap&s;ed,
during which, the illu&s;trious prince Eugene
gained the celebrated battle of Belgrade, and af|terwards
made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that important

to &s;it quietly in her tent, while &s;uch an
heroic &s;cene was acting. She was no &s;ooner ap|pri&s;ed
of the general's intention to attack the

in a waggon, which &s;he committed to the

her&s;elf in motion with the troops; big with the
expectation of re-acting that part, in which &s;he
had formerly acquitted her&s;elf &s;o much to her
advantage. Nay, &s;he by this time looked upon
her own pre&s;ence as a certain omen of &s;ucce&s;s
to the cau&s;e which &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed; and in their

in all of which her friends had been vic|torious,
and imputing &s;uch uncommon good
fortune to &s;ome &s;upernatural quality inherent
in her per&s;on.</P>
<P>Whether or not this confidence contributed
to the fortune of the day, by in&s;piriting the &s;ol|diers
to an uncommon pitch of courage and re|&s;olution,
I &s;hall not pretend to determine: but,
certain it is, the victory began from that
quarter in which &s;he had po&s;ted her&s;elf; and
no corps in the army behaved with &s;uch intre|pidity
as that, which was manife&s;ted by tho&s;e
who were favoured with her admonitions and
example; for, &s;he not only expo&s;ed her per&s;on
to the enemy's fire, with the indifference and
deliberation of a veteran, but &s;he is &s;aid to
have atchieved a very con&s;picuous exploit by
the prowe&s;s of her &s;ingle arm: the extremity
of the line to which &s;he had attached her&s;elf,
being a&s;&s;aulted in flank by a body of the &s;pahis,
wheeled about, in order to &s;u&s;tain the charge,
and received them with &s;uch a &s;ea&s;onable fire,
as brought a great number of turbans to the
ground; among tho&s;e who fell, was one of the
chiefs, or aga's, who had advanced before the
re&s;t, with a view to &s;ignalize his valour.</P>
<P>Our Engli&s;h Penthe&s;ilea no &s;ooner &s;aw this
Turki&s;h leader drop, than, &s;truck with the mag|nificence
of his own and hor&s;e's trappings, &s;he
&s;prung forward to &s;eize them as her prize, and
found the aga not dead, though in a good mea|&s;ure
di&s;abled by his misfortune, which was in|tirely
owing to the weight of his hor&s;e, that,
<PB N="17" REF="26">
having been killed by a mu&s;ket-ball, lay upon
his leg, &s;o that he could not di&s;ingage him&s;elf.
Neverthele&s;s, perceiving the virago approach
with fell intent, he brandi&s;hed his &s;cymitar, and
tried to intimidate his a&s;&s;ailant with a mo&s;t hor|rible
exclamation; but, it was not the di&s;mal yell
of a di&s;mounted cavalier, though enforced with
a hideous ferocity of countenance, and the me|nacing
ge&s;tures with which he waited her ap|proach,
that could intimidate &s;uch an undaunted
&s;he-campaigner; &s;he &s;aw him writhing in the
agonies of a &s;ituation from which he could not
move; and, running towards him with the nim|blene&s;s
and intrepidity of a Camilla, de&s;cribed
a &s;emicircle in the progre&s;s of her a&s;&s;ault, and
attacking him on one &s;ide, plunged her well-tried
dagger in his throat: the &s;hades of death
encompa&s;&s;ed him, his life-blood i&s;&s;ued at the
wound, he fell prone upon the earth, he bit
the du&s;t, and having thrice invoked the name
of Allah! &s;traight expired.</P>
<P>While his de&s;tiny was thus fulfilled, his follow|ers
began to reel; they &s;eemed di&s;mayed at the

clapping &s;purs to their hor&s;es, fled in the utmo&s;t
di&s;order. This was actually the circum&s;tance
that turned the &s;cale of battle: the Au&s;trians
pur&s;ued their good fortune with uncommon im|petuo&s;ity,
and in a few minutes, left the field

clear for the mother of our hero, who was &s;uch
an adept in the art of &s;tripping, that in the
twinkling of an eye, the bodies of the aga and
his Arabian, lay naked to the skin. It would
have been happy for her, had &s;he been content|ed
with the&s;e fir&s;t-fruits, reaped from the for|tune

which were not incon&s;iderable; but, intoxicated

capari&s;ons that lay &s;cattered on the plain,
and without doubt, prompted by the &s;ecret in|&s;tinct

her&s;elf for the many fatigues, hazards and
&s;orrows &s;he had undergone.</P>
<P>Thus determined, &s;he reconnoitred the field,
and practi&s;ed her addre&s;s &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that in
le&s;s than half an hour, &s;he was loaded with er|min
and embroidery, and di&s;po&s;ed to retreat with
her burden, when her regards were &s;ollicited by
a &s;plendid bundle, which &s;he de&s;cried at &s;ome
di&s;tance lying on the ground. This was no
other than an unhappy officer of hu&s;&s;ars; who,
after having had the good fortune to take a
Turki&s;h &s;tandard, was de&s;perately wounded in
the thigh, and obliged to quit his hor&s;e; finding
him&s;elf in &s;uch an helple&s;s condition, he had
wrapped his acqui&s;ition round his body, that
whatever might happen, he and his glory &s;hould
not be parted; and thus &s;hrouded among the
dying and the dead, he had ob&s;erved the progre&s;s
of our heroine, who &s;talked about the field,
like another Atropos, fini&s;hing, wherever &s;he
came, the work of death: he did not at all
doubt, that he him&s;elf would be vi&s;ited in the
cour&s;e of her peregrinations, and therefore pro|vided
<PB N="19" REF="28">
for her reception, with a pi&s;tol ready cock'd
in his hand, while he lay perdue, beneath his
covert, in all appearance bereft of life. He
was not deceived in his progno&s;tic; &s;he no &s;ooner
eyed the golden cre&s;cent, than inflamed with
curio&s;ity or cupidity, &s;he directed thitherward
her &s;teps, and di&s;cerning the carca&s;e of a man,
from which, &s;he thought, there would be a ne|ce&s;&s;ity
for di&s;engaging it, &s;he lifted up her weapon,
in order to make &s;ure of her purcha&s;e; and in
the very in&s;tant of di&s;charging her blow, receiv'd
a brace of bullets in her brain.</P>
<P>Thus ended the mortal pilgrimage of this
modern amazon; who, in point of courage, was
not inferior to Semiramis, Tomyris, Zenobia,
Thale$$ris, or any boa&s;ted heroine of antient

made a very deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the

attained the ninth year of his age, and been for
a con&s;iderable time, weaned from her maternal
care&s;&s;es; e&s;pecially, as he felt no wants nor
grievances in the family of the count, who fa|voured
him with a particular &s;hare of indulgence,
becau&s;e he perceived in him, a &s;pirit of docility,
in&s;inuation, and &s;agacity, far above his years.
He did not, however, fail to lament the untime|ly
fate of his mother, with &s;uch filial expre&s;&s;ions
of &s;orrow, as &s;till more intimately recommended
him to his patron; who being, him&s;elf, a
man of extraordinary benevolence, looked upon
the boy as a prodigy of natural affection, and
fore&s;aw in his future &s;ervices a fund of gratitude
and attachment, that could not fail to render
him a valuable acqui&s;ition to his family.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="29">
In his own country he had often &s;een connec|tions
of that &s;ort, which having been planted in
the infancy of the adherent, had grown up to
a &s;urpri&s;ing pitch of fidelity and friend&s;hip,
that no temptation could bia&s;s, and no danger
di&s;&s;olve. He therefore rejoiced in the hope of
&s;eeing his own &s;on accommodated with &s;uch a
faithful attendant, in the per&s;on of young Fa|thom,
on whom he re&s;olved to be&s;tow the &s;ame
education he had planned for the other, though
conveyed in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould be &s;uitable

In con&s;equence of the&s;e determinations, our
young adventurer led a very ea&s;y life, in quality
of page to the count, in who&s;e tent he lay up|on
a pallet, clo&s;e to his field-bed, and often di|verted
him with his childi&s;h prattle in the Engli&s;h

occa&s;ion to &s;peak, he the more delighted to hear.
In the exerci&s;e of his function, the boy was in|credibly
affiduous and alert; far from neglecting
the little particulars of his duty, and embark|ing
in the mi&s;chievous amu&s;ements of the chil|dren

had the&s;e &s;entiments, in all appearance, operated
upon his reflexion, that one morning while he
&s;uppo&s;ed the count a&s;leep, he crept &s;oftly to his
bed&s;ide, and gently ki&s;&s;ing his hand, which hap|pened
to be uncovered, pronounced, in a low
voice, a mo&s;t fervent prayer in his behalf, be|&s;eeching
Heaven to &s;hower down ble&s;&s;ings upon

him, as the widow's friend and the orphan's fa|ther:
this benediction was not lo&s;t upon the

with admiration; but, what rivetted Ferdinand
in his good graces, was a di&s;covery that our
youth made, while his ma&s;ter was upon duty in
the trenches before Belgrade.</P>
<P>Two foot-&s;oldiers &s;tanding centry near the
door of the tent, were captivated with the &s;ight
of &s;ome valuable moveables belonging to it; and
&s;uppo&s;ing, in their great wi&s;dom, that the city of
Belgrade was too well fortified to be taken dur|ing
that campaign, they came to a re&s;olution
of with-drawing them&s;elves from the &s;evere
&s;ervice of the trenches, by de&s;erting to the ene|my,
after they &s;hould have rifled count Melvil's
tent, of the furniture by which they were &s;o
powerfully allured: the particulars of this plan
were concerted in the French language, which,
they imagined, would &s;creen them from all ri&s;k
of being detected, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be over|heard,
though, as there was no living creature in
&s;ight, they had no rea&s;on to believe, that any
per&s;on was privy to their conver&s;ation. Never|thele&s;s,
they were mi&s;taken in both the&s;e con|jectures.
The conference reached the ears of
Fathom, who was at the other end of the tent,
and had perceived the eager looks, with which
they con&s;idered &s;ome parts of the furniture: he
had penetration enough to &s;u&s;pect their de&s;ire,
and alarmed by that &s;u&s;picion, li&s;tened atten|tively
to their di&s;cour&s;e, which from a &s;lender
knowledge in the French tongue, he had the
good fortune partly to under&s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="31">
This important piece of intelligence he com|municated
to the count at his return, and mea|&s;ures
were immediately taken to defeat the de|&s;ign,
and make an example of the authors, who
being permitted to load them&s;elves with the
booty, were apprehended in their retreat, and
puni&s;hed with death according to their demerits.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A brief detail of his education.</HEAD>
<P>NOthing could have more &s;ea&s;onably happen|ed,
to confirm the good opinion which
the colonel entertained of Ferdinand's principles:
his intentions towards the boy grew every day
more and more warm; and immediately after
the peace of Pa&s;&s;arowitz, he retired to his own
hou&s;e at Pre&s;burg, and pre&s;ented young Fathom
to his lady, not only as the &s;on of a per&s;on to
whom he owed his life, but al&s;o as a lad, who
merited his peculiar protection and regard by his
own per&s;onal virtue. The counte&s;s, who was an
Hungarian, received him with great kindne&s;s
and affability, and her &s;on was ravi&s;hed with
the pro&s;pect of enjoying &s;uch a companion: in
&s;hort, fortune &s;eemed to have provided for him
an a&s;ylum, in which he might be &s;afely trained
up, and &s;uitably prepared for more important
&s;cenes of life, than any of his ance&s;tors had ever
known.</P>
<P>He was not, in all re&s;pects, entertained on the
footing of his young ma&s;ter; yet he &s;har'd in all his
education and amu&s;ements, as one whom the old
gentleman was fully determined to qualify for the
&s;tation of an officer in the &s;ervice; and if he
<PB N="23" REF="32">
did not eat with the count, he was every day
regaled with choice bits from his table; holding,
as it were, a middle place between the rank of
a relation; and favoured dome&s;tic. Although
his patron maintained a tutor in the hou&s;e, to
&s;uperintend the conduct of his heir, he com|mitted
the charge of his learning to the in&s;truc|tions
of a public &s;chool; where, he imagined,
the boy would imbibe a laudable &s;pirit of emula|tion
among his fellows, which could not fail of
turning out to the advantage of his education.
Ferdinand was entered in the &s;ame academy;
and the two lads proceeded equally in the paths
of erudition; a mutual friend&s;hip and intimacy
&s;oon en&s;ued, and notwith&s;tanding the levity and
caprice commonly di&s;cernible in the behaviour
of &s;uch boys, very few, or rather no quarrels
happened in the cour&s;e of their communication.
Yet their di&s;po&s;itions were altogether different,
and their talents unlike. Nay, this di&s;&s;imila|rity
was the very bond of their union; becau&s;e
it prevented that jealou&s;y and rival&s;hip which of|ten
interrupts the harmony of two warm co|temporaries.</P>
<P>The young count made extraordinary pro|gre&s;s
in the exerci&s;es of the &s;chool, though he
&s;eemed to take very little pains in the cultiva|tion
of his &s;tudies; and became a perfect hero in
all the athletic diver&s;ions of his fellow-&s;cholars;
but, at the &s;ame time, exhibited &s;uch a ba&s;hful
appearance and uncouth addre&s;s, that his mo|ther
de&s;paired of ever &s;eeing him improved into
any degree of polite behaviour. On the other
hand, Fathom, who was in point of learning a
meer dunce, became, even in his childhood, re|markable
among the ladies for his genteel de|portment
<PB N="24" REF="33">
and vivacity; they admired the profi|ciency
he made, under the directions of his dan|cing-ma&s;ter,
the air with which he performed
his obei&s;ance at his entrance and exit; and were
charmed with the agreeable a&s;&s;urance and lively
&s;allies of his conver&s;ation; while they expre&s;s|ed
the utmo&s;t concern and di&s;gu&s;t at the boori&s;h
demeanour of his companion, who&s;e extorted
bows re&s;embled the pawings of a mule, who
hung his head in &s;ilence, like a detected &s;heep-&s;tealer,
who &s;at in company under the mo&s;t auk|ward
expre&s;&s;ions of con&s;traint, and who&s;e di&s;|cour&s;e
never exceeded the &s;imple mono&s;yllable$
of negation and a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>In vain did all the females of the family pro|po&s;e
to him young Fathom, as a pattern and re|proach:
he remained unaltered by all their ef|forts
and expo&s;tulations, and allowed our adven|turer
to enjoy the triumph of his prai&s;e, while
he him&s;elf was con&s;cious of his own &s;uperiority
in tho&s;e qualifications which &s;eemed of more
real importance than the meer exteriors and
forms of life. His pre&s;ent ambition was not to
make a figure at his father's table, but to
eclip&s;e his rivals at &s;chool, and to acquire an
influence and authority among the&s;e confederates.
Neverthele&s;s, Fathom might po&s;&s;ibly have fallen
under his di&s;plea&s;ure or contempt, had not that
pliant genius found means to retain his friend|&s;hip
by &s;ea&s;onable compliances and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion;
for, the &s;ole &s;tudy, or at lea&s;t the chief aim of
Ferdinand, was to make him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary and
agreeable to tho&s;e on whom his dependance
was placed: his talent was in this particular &s;uit|ed
to his inclination; he &s;eemed to have inherit|ed
it from his mother's womb; and without all
<PB N="25" REF="34">
doubt, would have rai&s;ed upon it, a mo&s;t ad|mirable
&s;uper&s;tructure of fortune and applau&s;e,
had not it been in&s;eparably yoked with a mo&s;t
in&s;idious principle of &s;elf-love, that grew up
with him from the cradle, and left no room
in his heart for the lea&s;t particle of &s;ocial virtue.
This la&s;t, however, he knew &s;o well how to
counterfeit, by means of a large &s;hare of ducti|lity
and di&s;&s;imulation, that, &s;urely, he was cal|culated
by nature, to dupe even the mo&s;t cau|tious,
and gratify his appetites by levying con|tributions
on all mankind.</P>
<P>So little are the common in&s;tructors of youth,
qualified to judge the capacities of tho&s;e who are
under their tutelage and care, that Fathom, by
dint of his in&s;inuating arts, made &s;hift to pa&s;s
upon the &s;choolma&s;ter, as a lad of quick parts,
in de&s;pite of a natural inaptitude to retain his
le&s;&s;ons, which all his indu&s;try could never over|come.
In order to remedy, or rather to cloak
this defect in his under&s;tanding, he had always
recour&s;e to the friend&s;hip of the young count,
who freely permitted him to tran&s;cribe his exer|ci&s;es,
until a &s;mall accident happened, which
had well-nigh put a &s;top to the&s;e in&s;tances of his
genero&s;ity.&mdash;The adventure, incon&s;iderable as
it is, we &s;hall record, as the fir&s;t overt-act of Fer|dinand's
true character, as well as an illu&s;tration
of the opinion we have advanced, touching the
blind and injudicious deci&s;ions of a right peda|gogue.</P>
<P>Among other ta&s;ks impo&s;ed by the pedant,
upon the form to which our two companions
belonged, they were one evening ordered to
tran&s;late a chapter of Cae&s;ar's commentaries.
Accordingly the young count went to work, and
<PB N="26" REF="35">
performed the undertaking with great elegance
and di&s;patch: Fathom having &s;pent the night in
more effeminate amu&s;ements, was next morning
&s;o much hurried for want of time, that in his
tran&s;cription, he neglected to in&s;ert a few varia|tions
from the text; the&s;e being the terms on
which he was allowed to u&s;e it: &s;o that it was
verbatim a copy of the original. As tho&s;e exer|ci&s;es
were always delivered in a heap, &s;ub&s;cribed
with the &s;everal names of the boys to whom
they belonged; the &s;choolma&s;ter chanced to pe|ru&s;e
the ver&s;ion of Ferdinand, before he looked
into any of the re&s;t, and could not help be&s;tow|ing
upon it particular marks of approbation:
the next that fell under his examination was
that of the young count, when he immediately
perceived the &s;amene&s;s, and far from imputing
it to the true cau&s;e, upbraided him with hav|ing
copied the exerci&s;e of our adventurer, and
in&s;i&s;ted upon cha&s;ti&s;ing him upon the &s;pot, for
his want of application.</P>
<P>Had not the young gentleman thought his
honour was concerned, he would have &s;ubmit|ed
to the puni&s;hment without murmuring; but
he inherited from his parents the pride of two
fierce nations, and being overwhelmed with re|proaches,
for that which he imagined, ought to
have redounded to his glory, he could not brook
the indignity, and boldly affirmed, that he him|&s;elf
was the original, to whom Ferdinand was
beholden for his performance. The &s;chool|ma&s;ter,
nettled to find him&s;elf mi&s;taken in his
judgment, re&s;olved that the count &s;hould have
no cau&s;e to exult in the di&s;covery he had made,
and like a true flogger, actually whipt him for
having allowed Fathom to copy his exerci&s;e.
<PB N="27" REF="36">
Nay, in the hope of vindicating his own pene|tration,
he took an opportunity of que&s;tioning
Ferdinand in private, concerning the circum|&s;tances
of the tran&s;lation; and our hero perceiv|ing
his drift, gave him &s;uch artful and ambiguous
an&s;wers, as per&s;uaded him, that the young count
had acted the part of a plagiary, and that the
other had been re&s;trained from doing him&s;elf
ju&s;tice, by the con&s;ideration of his own dependance.</P>
<P>This profound director did not fail, in honour
of his own di&s;cernment, to whi&s;per about the
mi&s;repre&s;entation, as an in&s;tance of the young
count's in&s;olence, and Fathom's humility and
good &s;en&s;e. The &s;tory was circulated among
the &s;ervants, e&s;pecially the maids belonging to the
family, who&s;e favour our hero had acquired by his
engaging behaviour; and at length it reached the
ears of his patron, who incen&s;ed at his &s;on's
pre&s;umption and inho&s;pitality, called him to a
&s;evere account, when the young gentleman
ab&s;olutely denied the truth of the allegation, and
appealed to the evidence of Fathom him&s;elf.
Our adventurer was accordingly &s;ummoned by
the father, and encouraged to declare the truth,
with an a&s;&s;urance of his con&s;tant protection;
upon which, Ferdinand very wi&s;ely fell upon his
knees, and while the tears gu&s;hed from his eyes,
acquitted the young count of the imputation,
and expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion, that the report
had been &s;pread by &s;ome of his enemies, who
wanted to prejudice him in the opinion of his
patron.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was not &s;atisfied of his
&s;on's integrity, by this declaration; being natu|rally
of a generous di&s;po&s;ition, highly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
<PB N="28" REF="37">
in favour of the poor orphan, and chagrined
at the unpromi&s;ing appearance of his heir, he
&s;u&s;pected that Fathom was over-awed by the fear
of giving offence, and that notwith&s;tanding what
he had &s;aid, the ca&s;e really &s;tood as it had been
repre&s;ented. In this per&s;ua&s;ion, he earne&s;tly
exhorted his &s;on to re&s;i&s;t and combat with any
impul&s;e he might feel within him&s;elf, tending
to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, fraud or impo&s;ition; to encourage
every &s;entiment of candour and benevolence, and
to behave with moderation and affability to all his
fellow-creatures. He laid upon him &s;trong injunc|tions,
not without a mixture of threats, to con&s;i|der
Fathom as the object of his peculiar regard;
to re&s;pect him as the &s;on of the count's pre&s;er|ver,
as a Briton, a &s;tranger, and above all, an
helple&s;s orphan, to whom the rights of ho&s;pita|lity
were doubly due.</P>
<P>Such admonitions were not lo&s;t upon the
youth, who under the rough hu&s;k of his per|&s;onal
exhibition, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large &s;hare of ge|nerous
&s;en&s;ibility: without any formal profe&s;&s;ions
to his father, he re&s;olved to govern him&s;elf ac|cording
to his remon&s;trances; and far from con|ceiving
the lea&s;t &s;park of animo&s;ity again&s;t Fa|thom,
he looked upon the poor boy as the inno|cent
cau&s;e of his di&s;grace, and redoubled his
kindne&s;s towards him, that his honour might
never again be called in que&s;tion, upon the &s;ame
&s;ubject. Nothing is more liable to mi&s;con&s;truc|tion
than an act of uncommon genero&s;ity; one
half of the world mi&s;take the motive, from want
of ideas to conceive an in&s;tance of beneficence,
that &s;oars &s;o high above the level of their own
&s;entiments; and the re&s;t &s;u&s;pect it of &s;omething
fini&s;ter or &s;elfi&s;h, from the &s;ugge&s;tions of their
<PB N="29" REF="38">
own &s;ordid and vicious inclinations. The young
count &s;ubjected him&s;elf to &s;uch mi&s;interpreta|tion,
among tho&s;e who ob&s;erved the increa&s;ed
warmth of civility and complai&s;ance in his beha|viour
to Ferdinand: they a&s;cribed it to his de&s;ire
of &s;till profiting by our adventurer's &s;uperior ta|lents,
by which alone they &s;uppo&s;ed him enabled
to maintain any degree of reputation at &s;chool;
or to the fear of being convicted by him of &s;ome
mi&s;demeanour of which he knew him&s;elf guilty.
The&s;e &s;u&s;picions were not effaced by the conduct
of Ferdinand, who, when examined on the &s;ub|ject,
managed his an&s;wers in &s;uch a manner, as
confirmed their conjectures, while he pretended
to refute them, and at the &s;ame time acquired to
him&s;elf credit for his extraordinary di&s;cretion and
&s;elf-denial.</P>
<P>If he exhibited &s;uch a proof of &s;agacity in the
twelfth year of his age, what might not be ex|pected
from his fine&s;&s;e, in the maturity of his
faculties and experience? Thus &s;ecured in the
good graces of the whole family, he &s;aw the
days of his puerility glide along in the mo&s;t a|greeable
elap&s;e of care&s;&s;es and amu&s;ement. He
never fairly plunged into the &s;tream of &s;chool
education; but, by floating on the &s;urface, im|bibed
a &s;mall tincture of tho&s;e different &s;ciences,
which his ma&s;ter pretended to teach; in &s;hort,
he re&s;embled tho&s;e vagrant &s;wallows that &s;kim
along the level of &s;ome pool or river, without
venturing to wet one feather in their wings, ex|cept
in the accidental pur&s;uit of an incon&s;ider|able
fly. Yet, though his capacity or inclina|tion
was un&s;uited for &s;tudies of this kind, he
did not fail to manife&s;t a perfect genius in the
acqui&s;ition of other more profitable arts. Over
<PB N="30" REF="39">
and above the accompli&s;hments of addre&s;s, for
which he hath been already celebrated, he ex|celled
all his fellows in his dexterity at &s;ives and
billiards; was altogether unrivalled in his &s;kill at
draughts and backgammon; began even at the&s;e
years, to under&s;tand the moves and &s;chemes
of che&s;s; and made him&s;elf a meer adept in the
my&s;tery of cards, which he learned in the cour&s;e
of his a&s;&s;iduities and attention to the females of
the hou&s;e.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He meditates &s;chemes of importance.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in the&s;e parties, that he attracted the
notice and friend&s;hip of his patron's daugh|ter,
a girl by two years older than him&s;elf, who
was not in&s;en&s;ible to his qualifications, and look|ed
upon him with the mo&s;t favourable eyes of
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Whether or not he at this period
of his life, began to project plans for availing
him&s;elf of her &s;u&s;ceptibility, is uncertain; but
without all doubt, he cultivated her e&s;teem with
as ob&s;equious and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive attention, as if he
had already formed the de&s;ign which in his ad|vanced
age, he attempted to put in execu|tion.</P>
<P>Divers circum&s;tances con&s;pired to promote
him in the favour of this young lady; the green|ne&s;s
of his years, &s;ecured him from any &s;u&s;pi|cion
of fallacious aim; &s;o that he was indulged
in frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing with his
young mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e parents encouraged this
communication, by which they hoped &s;he would
improve in &s;peaking the language of her father.
<PB N="31" REF="40">
Such connexions naturally produce intimacy and
friend&s;hip. Fathom's per&s;on was agreeable, his
talents calculated for the meridian of tho&s;e par|ties,
and his manners &s;o engaging, that there
would have been no ju&s;t &s;ubject for wonder,
had he made an impre&s;&s;ion upon the tender un|experienced
heart of Mademoi&s;elle de Melvil,
who&s;e beauty was not &s;o attractive as to extin|gui&s;h
his hope, in rai&s;ing up a number of formi|dable
rivals; though her expectations of fortune
were &s;uch as commonly lend additional lu&s;tre to
per&s;onal merit.</P>
<P>All the&s;e con&s;iderations were &s;o many &s;teps to|wards
the &s;ucce&s;s of Ferdinand's preten&s;ions;
and though he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have per|ceived
them at fir&s;t, he in the &s;equel, &s;eemed
perfectly well apprized of his advantages, and
u&s;ed them to the full extent of his faculties. Ob|&s;erving
that &s;he delighted in mu&s;ic, he betook
him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of that art, and by dint of
application and a tolerable ear, learned of him&s;elf
to accompany her with a german flute, while
&s;he &s;ung and played upon the harp&s;ichord. The
count &s;eeing his inclination, and the progre&s;s he
had made, re&s;olved that his capacity &s;hould not
be lo&s;t for want of cultivation; and accordingly
provided him with a ma&s;ter, by whom he was
in&s;tructed in the principles of the art, and &s;oon
became a proficient in playing upon the violin.</P>
<P>In the practice of the&s;e improvements and
avocations, and in attendance upon his young
ma&s;ter, whom he took care never to di&s;oblige or
neglect, he attained to the age of &s;ixteen, with|out
feeling the lea&s;t abatement in the friend&s;hip
and genero&s;ity of tho&s;e upon whom he depend|ed;
but, on the contrary, receiving every day
<PB N="32" REF="41">
fre&s;h marks of their bounty and regard. He had
before this time, been &s;mit with the ambition of
making a conque&s;t of the young lady's heart;
and fore&s;aw manifold advantages to him&s;elf, in
becoming &s;on in law to count Melvil, who, he
never doubted, would &s;oon be reconciled to the
match, if once it could be effectuated without
his knowledge. Altho' he thought he had great
rea&s;on to believe that Mademoi&s;elle looked upon
him with an eye of peculiar favour, his di&s;po&s;i|tion
was happily tempered with an ingredient of
caution, that hindered him from acting with
precipitation, and he had di&s;cerned in the young
lady's deportment certain indications of loftine&s;s
and pride, which kept him in the utmo&s;t vigi|lance
of circum&s;pection; for, he knew that by
a premature declaration, he &s;hould run the ri&s;que
of forfeiting all the advantages he had gained,
and bla&s;ting tho&s;e expectations that now blo&s;&s;om|ed
&s;o gaily in his heart.</P>
<P>Re&s;tricted by the&s;e reflections, he acted at a
wary di&s;tance, and determined to proceed by
the method of &s;ap, and &s;ummoning all his arti|fice
and attractions to his aid, employed them un|der
the in$idious cover of profound re&s;pect, in order
to undermine tho&s;e bulwarks of haughtine&s;s or di&s;|cretion,
which, otherwi&s;e, might have rendered
his approaches to her impracticable. With a view
to inhance the value of his company, and &s;ound
her &s;entiments at the &s;ame time, he became more
re&s;erved than u&s;ual, and &s;eldomer engaged in her
parties of mu&s;ic and cards; yet in the mid&s;t
of his re&s;erve he never failed in tho&s;e de|mon&s;trations
of reverence and regard, which he
knew perfectly well how to expre&s;s; but devi&s;ed
&s;uch excu&s;es for his ab&s;ence, as &s;he could not
<PB N="33" REF="42">
help admitting. In con&s;equence of this affected
&s;hyne&s;s, &s;he more than once, gently chid him
for his neglect and indifference, ob&s;erving,
with an ironical air, that he was now too much
of a man to be entertained with &s;uch effeminate
diver&s;ions; but her reproofs were pronounced
with too much ea&s;e and good humour to be
agreeable to our hero, who de&s;ired to &s;ee her
ruffled and chagrined at his ab&s;ence, and to hear
him&s;elf rebuked with an angry affectation of
di&s;dain. This effort, therefore, he reinforced
with the mo&s;t captivating carriage he could a&s;|&s;ume,
in tho&s;e hours which he now &s;o &s;paringly
be&s;towed upon his mi&s;tre&s;s; he regaled her with
all the entertaining &s;tories he could learn or in|vent,
particularly &s;uch as he thought would ju&s;|tify
and recommend the levelling power of love,
that knows no di&s;tinctions of fortune. He &s;ung
nothing but tender airs and pa&s;&s;ionate complaints,
compo&s;ed by de&s;ponding or de&s;pairing &s;wains;
and to render his performances of this kind the
more pathetic, interlarded them with &s;ome &s;ea|&s;onable
&s;ighs, while the tears which he had ever
at command, &s;tood collected in either eye.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for her to overlook &s;uch &s;tu|died
emotions; &s;he in a joco&s;e manner, taxed
him with having lo&s;t his heart, rallied the exce&s;s
of his pa&s;&s;ion, and in a merry &s;train undertook
to be an advocate for his love. Her behaviour
was &s;till wide of his wi&s;h and expectation: he
thought &s;he would, in con&s;equence of her di&s;co|very,
have betrayed &s;ome intere&s;ted &s;ymptom;
that her face would have undergone &s;ome fa|vourable
&s;uffu&s;ion; that her tongue would have
faultered, her brea&s;t heaved, and her whole de|portment
betokened internal agitation and di&s;|order;
<PB N="34" REF="43">
in which ca&s;e, he meant to profit by the
happy impre&s;&s;ion, and declare him&s;elf before &s;he
could po&s;&s;ibly recollect the dictates of her pride.
Baffled however in his endeavours, by the &s;ere|nity
of the young lady, which he &s;till deemed
equivocal, he had recour&s;e to another experi|ment,
by which he believed, he &s;hould make a
di&s;covery of her &s;entiments, beyond all po&s;&s;ibi|lity
of doubt. One day, while he accompanied
Mademoi&s;elle in her exerci&s;es of mu&s;ic, he pre|tended
all of a &s;udden, to be taken ill, and
counterfeited a &s;woon in her apartment. Sur|pri&s;ed
at this accident, &s;he &s;creamed aloud,
but far from running to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with the
tran&s;ports and di&s;traction of a lover, &s;he ordered
her maid, who was pre&s;ent, to &s;upport his head,
and went in per&s;on to call for more help: he
was accordingly removed to his own chamber,
where, willing to be &s;till more certified of her
inclinations, he prolonged the farce, and lay
groaning under the pretence of a &s;evere fever.</P>
<P>The whole family was alarmed upon this oc|ca&s;ion;
for as we have already ob&s;erved, he was
an univer&s;al favourite. He was immediately
vi&s;ited by the old count and his lady, who ex|pre&s;&s;ed
the utmo&s;t concern at his di&s;temper,
ordered him to be carefully attended, and &s;ent
for a phy&s;ician, without lo&s;s of time. The
young gentleman would &s;carce &s;tir from his bed|&s;ide,
where he mini&s;tred unto him with all the
demon&s;trations of brotherly affection; and mi&s;s
exhorted him to keep up his &s;pirits, with many
expre&s;&s;ions of unre&s;erved &s;ympathy and regard:
neverthele&s;s, he &s;aw nothing in her behaviour,
but what might be naturally expected from com|mon
friend&s;hip, and a compa&s;&s;ionate di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="35" REF="44">
and was very much mortified at his di&s;appoint|ment.</P>
<P>Whether the mi&s;carriage actually affected his
con&s;titution, or the doctor happened to be mi&s;|taken
in his diagno&s;tics, we &s;hall not pretend to
determine; but the patient was certainly treated
Secundum Artem, and all his complaints in a little
time realized; for the phy&s;ician, like a true gra|duate,
had an eye to the apothecary, in his pre|&s;criptions;
and &s;uch was the concern and &s;cru|pulous
care with which our hero was attended,
that the orders of the faculty were performed
with the utmo&s;t punctuality. He was blooded,
vomited, purged and bli&s;tered in the u&s;ual forms,
(for the phy&s;icians of Hungary are generally as
well &s;killed in the arts of their occupation, as
any other leeches under the &s;un) and &s;wallowed
a whole di&s;pen&s;ary of bolu&s;&s;es, draughts and apo|zems,
by which means he became fairly deli|rious
in three days, and &s;o untractable, that he
could be no longer managed according to rule;
otherwi&s;e in all likelihood, the world would ne|ver
have enjoyed the benefit of the&s;e adventures.
In &s;hort, his con&s;titution, though unable to cope
with two &s;uch formidable antagoni&s;ts, as the
doctor, and the di&s;ea&s;e he had conjured up, was
no &s;ooner rid of the one, than it ea&s;ily got the
better of the other, and though Ferdinand after
all, found his grand aim unaccompli&s;hed, his
malady was productive of a con&s;equence, which
though he had not fore&s;een it, he did not fail to
convert to his own u&s;e and advantage.</P>

order to put his talents in action.</HEAD>
<P>WHile he di&s;played his qualifications in
order to intrap the heart of his young
mi&s;tre&s;s, he had unwittingly en&s;laved the affec|tions
of her maid. This attendant was al&s;o a
favourite of the young lady, and though her
&s;enior by two or three good years at lea&s;t, un|que&s;tionably
her &s;uperior in point of per&s;onal
beauty; &s;he morever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good &s;tock
of cunning and di&s;cernment, and was furni&s;hed
by nature with a very amorous complexion.
The&s;e circum&s;tances being premi&s;ed, the reader
will not be &s;urpri&s;ed to find her &s;mitten by tho&s;e
uncommon qualifications which we have cele|brated
in young Fathom. She had in good
&s;ooth, long &s;ighed in &s;ecret, under the power|ful
influence of his charms, and practi&s;ed upon
him all tho&s;e little arts, by which a woman
&s;trives to attract the admiration and en&s;nare the
heart of a man &s;he loves; but, all his faculties
were employed upon the plan which he had al|ready
projected; that was the goal of his whole
attention, to which all his mea&s;ures tended; and
whether or not he perceived the impre&s;&s;ion he
had made upon Tere&s;a, he never gave her the
lea&s;t rea&s;on to believe he was con&s;cious of his
victory, until he found him&s;elf baffled in his
de&s;ign upon the heart of her mi&s;tre&s;s. She there|fore
per&s;evered in her di&s;tant attempts to allure
him, with the u&s;ual coquetries of dre&s;s and ad|dre&s;s,
and in the &s;weet hope of profiting by his
<PB N="37" REF="46">
&s;u&s;ceptibility, made &s;hift to &s;uppre&s;s her feelings,
and keep her pa&s;&s;ion within bounds; until his
&s;uppo&s;ed danger alarmed her fears, and rai&s;ed
&s;uch a tumult within her brea&s;t, that &s;he could
no longer conceal her love, but gave a loo&s;e to
her &s;orrow in the mo&s;t immoderate expre&s;&s;ions
of angui&s;h and affliction, and while his delirium
la&s;ted, behaved with all the agitation of a de|&s;pairing
&s;hepherde&s;s.</P>
<P>Ferdinand was, or pretended to be, the la&s;t
per&s;on in the family, who under&s;tood the &s;itua|tion
of her thoughts; when he perceived her
pa&s;&s;ion, he entered into deliberation with him|&s;elf,
and ta&s;ked his reflexion and fore&s;ight, in
order to di&s;cover how be&s;t he might convert this
conque&s;t to his own advantage. Here, then,
that we may neglect no opportunity of doing
ju&s;tice to our hero, it will be proper to ob&s;erve,
that how&s;oever unapt his under&s;tanding might be
to receive and retain the u&s;ual culture of the
&s;chools, he was naturally a genius &s;elf-taught,
in point of &s;agacity and invention. He dived
into the characters of mankind, with a pene|tration
peculiar to him&s;elf, and had he been ad|mitted
as a pupil in any political academy, would
have certainly become one of the able&s;t &s;tate&s;men
in Europe.</P>
<P>Having revolved all the probable con&s;equences
of &s;uch a connexion, he determined to pro&s;ecute
an amour with the lady who&s;e affection he had
&s;ubdued; becau&s;e he hoped to intere&s;t her as an
auxiliary in his grand &s;cheme upon Mademoi&s;elle,
which he did not as yet think proper to lay
a&s;ide; for, he was not more ambitious in the
plan, than indefatigable in the pro&s;ecution of it.
He knew it would be impo&s;&s;ible to execute his
<PB N="38" REF="47">
aims upon the count's daughter, under the eye
of Tere&s;a, who&s;e natural di&s;cernment would be
whetted with jealou&s;y, and who would watch
his conduct, and thwart his progre&s;s with all the
vigilance and &s;pite of a &s;lighted maiden. On
the other hand, he did not doubt of being able
to bring her over to his intere&s;t, by the influence
he had already gained, or might afterwards ac|quire
over her pa&s;&s;ions; in which ca&s;e, &s;he would
effectually e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, and employ her
good offices with her mi&s;tre&s;s, in his behalf:
be&s;ides, he was induced by another motive,
which though &s;econdary, did not fail in this ca&s;e
to have an effect upon his determination. He
looked upon Tere&s;a with the eyes of appetite,
which he longed to gratify: for he was not at
all dead to the in&s;tigations of the fle&s;h, though
he had philo&s;ophy enough to re&s;i&s;t them, when
he thought they interfered with his intere&s;t. Here
the ca&s;e was quite different: his de&s;ire happen|ed
to be upon the &s;ide of his advantage, and
therefore, re&s;olving to indulge it, he no &s;ooner
found him&s;elf in a condition to manage &s;uch an
adventure, than he began to make gradual ad|vances
in point of warmth and particular com|placency
to the love-&s;ick maid.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t of all, thanked her in the mo&s;t grate|ful
terms, for the concern &s;he had manife&s;ted at
his di&s;temper, and the kind &s;ervices he had re|ceived
from her, during the cour&s;e of it; he
treated her upon all occa&s;ions, with unu&s;ual
affability and regard, a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly courted her ac|quaintance
and conver&s;ation, and contracted an
intimacy that, in a little time, produced a de|claration
of love. Although her heart was too
much intendered to hold out again&s;t all the forms
<PB N="39" REF="48">
of a&s;&s;ault, far from yielding at di&s;cretion, &s;he
&s;tood upon honourable terms, with great ob&s;ti|nacy
of punctilio, and while &s;he owned he was
ma&s;ter of her inclinations, gave him to under|&s;tand
with a peremptory and re&s;olute air, that
he &s;hould never make a conque&s;t of her virtue:
ob&s;erving, that if the pa&s;&s;ion he profe&s;&s;ed was
genuine, he would not &s;cruple to give &s;uch a
proof of it, as would at once convince her
of his &s;incerity; and that he could have no
ju&s;t cau&s;e to refu&s;e her that &s;atisfaction, &s;he
being his equal in point of birth and &s;ituation:
for, if he was the companion and favourite of
the young count, &s;he was the friend and confi|dante
of Mademoi&s;elle.</P>
<P>He acknowledged the &s;trength of her argu|ment,
and that her conde&s;cen&s;ion was greater
than his de&s;e$ts; but objected again&s;t the propo|&s;al,
as infinitely prejudicial to the fortunes of them
both. He repre&s;ented the &s;tate of dependance
in which they mutually &s;tood; their utter in|capacity
to &s;upport one another, under the con|&s;equences
of a precipitate match, clande&s;tinely
made, without the con&s;ent and concurrence of
their patrons: he di&s;played, with great eloquence,
all tho&s;e gay expectations they had rea&s;on to
entertain, from that eminent degree of favour
which they had already &s;ecured in the family;
and &s;et forth, in the mo&s;t alluring colours, tho&s;e
enchanting &s;cenes of plea&s;ures they might enjoy,
in each other, without that di&s;agreeable con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
of a nuptial chain, provided &s;he would
be his a&s;&s;ociate in the execution of a plan,
which he had projected for their reciprocal con|venience.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="49">
Having thus inflamed her love of plea&s;ure and
curio&s;ity, he, with great caution, hinted his de|&s;ign
upon the young lady's fortune, and per|ceiving
her li&s;tening with the mo&s;t greedy atten|tion,
and perfectly ripe for the con&s;piracy, he
di&s;clo&s;ed his intention at full length, a&s;&s;uring her,
with the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations of love and
attachment, that could he once make him&s;elf
legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of an e&s;tate which Mademoi&s;elle
inherited, by the will of a decea&s;ed aunt, his
dear Tere&s;a &s;hould reap the happy fruits of his
affluence; and wholly engro&s;s his time and at|tention.</P>
<P>Such a ba&s;e declaration our hero would not have
ventured to make, had he not implicitly believed
the dam&s;el was as great a latitudinarian as him|&s;elf
in point of morals and principle; and been
well a&s;&s;ured that though he &s;hould be mi&s;taken
in her way of thinking, &s;o far as to be threat|ned
with a detection of his purpo&s;e, he would
always have it in his power to refute her accu&s;a|tion
as meer calumny, by the character he had
hitherto maintained, and the circum&s;pection of
his future conduct.</P>
<P>He &s;eldom or never erred in his ob&s;ervations
on the human heart. Tere&s;a, in&s;tead of di&s;|approving,
reli&s;hed the plan in general, with de|mon&s;trations
of &s;ingular &s;atisfaction: &s;he, at once
conceived all the advantageous con&s;equences of
&s;uch a &s;cheme, and perceived in it, only one
flaw, which, however, &s;he did not think incurable.
This defect was no other than a &s;ufficient bond
of union, by which they might be effectually
tied down to their mutual intere&s;t. She fore&s;aw
that in ca&s;e Ferdinand &s;hould obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="41" REF="50">
the prize, he might, with great ea&s;e, deny their
contract, and di&s;avow her claim of participation.
She therefore demanded &s;ecurity, and propo&s;ed
as a preliminary of the agreement, that he
&s;hould privately take her to wife, with a view
to di&s;pel all her apprehen&s;ions of his incon&s;tancy
or deceit, as &s;uch a previous engagement would
be a check upon his behaviour, and keep him
&s;trictly to the letter of their contract.</P>
<P>He could not help &s;ub&s;cribing to the righteou&s;|ne&s;s
of this propo&s;al, which, neverthele&s;s, he
would have willingly waved, on the &s;uppo&s;ition
that they could not po&s;&s;ibly be joined in the
bands of wedlock, with &s;uch &s;ecrecy as the
nature of the ca&s;e ab&s;olutely required. This
would have been a difficulty &s;oon removed, had
the &s;cene of the tran&s;action been laid in the
metropolis of England, where pa&s;&s;engers are
plied in the &s;treets by clergymen, who pro&s;titute
their characters and con&s;ciences for hire, in de|fiance
of all decency and law; but in the king|dom
of Hungary, eccle&s;ia&s;tics are more &s;cru|pulous
in the exerci&s;e of their function, and the
objection was, or &s;uppo&s;ed to be altogether in|&s;urmountable;
&s;o that they were fain to have
recour&s;e to an expedient, with which, after &s;ome
he&s;itation, our &s;he-adventurer was &s;atisfied. They
joined hands in the &s;ight of Heaven, which they
called to witne&s;s, and to judge the &s;incerity of
their vows, and engaged in a voluntary oath to
confirm their union by the &s;anction of the
church, whenever a convenient opportunity for
&s;o doing, &s;hould occur.</P>
<P>The &s;cruples of Tere&s;a being thus removed,
&s;he admitted Ferdinand to the privileges of a
<PB N="42" REF="51">
hu&s;band, which he enjoyed in &s;tolen interviews;
and readily undertook to exert her whole power
in promoting his &s;uit with her young mi&s;tre&s;s,
becau&s;e &s;he now con&s;idered his intere&s;t as in&s;e|parably
connected with her own. Surely no|thing
could be more ab&s;urd or prepo&s;terous,
than the articles of this covenant, which &s;he in|&s;i&s;ted
upon with &s;uch inflexibility. How could &s;he
&s;uppo&s;e, that her pretended lover would be re&s;train|ed
by an oath, when the very occa&s;ion of incur|ing
it, was an intention to act in violation of all
laws human and divine; and yet &s;uch ridiculous
conjuration is commonly the cement of every con|&s;piracy,
how dark, how treacherous, how im|pious
&s;oever it may be. A certain &s;ign that there
are &s;ome remains of religion left in the human
mind, even after every moral &s;entiment hath
abandoned it; and that the mo&s;t execrable ruf|fian
finds means to quiet the &s;ugge&s;tions of his
con&s;cience, by &s;ome rever&s;ionary hope of hea|ven's
forgivene&s;s.</P>

family; and that with a view to countenance
this affectation, he &s;hould upon all occa&s;ions
treat her with an air of loftine&s;s and di&s;dain.</P>
<P>So &s;creened from all imputation of fraud, &s;he
was furni&s;hed by him with artful in&s;tructions,
how to &s;ound the inclinations of her young mi&s;|tre&s;s;
how to recommend his per&s;on and quali|fications
by the &s;ure methods of contradiction,
compari&s;on, revilings and reproach; how to
watch the paroxy&s;ms of her di&s;po&s;ition, inflame
her pa&s;&s;ions, and improve, for his advantage,
tho&s;e moments of frailty, from which no wo|man
is exempted. In &s;hort, this con&s;ummate
politician taught his agent to poi&s;on the young
lady's mind with in$idious conver&s;ation, tending
to in&s;pire her with the love of guilty plea&s;ure,
to debauch her &s;entiments, and confound her
ideas of dignity and virtue. After all, the ta&s;k
is not difficult to lead the unpracti&s;ed heart
a&s;tray, by dint of tho&s;e opportunities her &s;educer
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The &s;eeds of in&s;inuation &s;ea&s;onably
&s;own upon the warm, luxuriant &s;oil of youth,
could hardly fail of &s;hooting up into &s;uch in|temperate
de&s;ires as he wanted to produce; e&s;pe|cially
when cultured and cheri&s;hed in her un|guarded
hours, by that &s;timulating di&s;cour&s;e
which familiarity admits, and the loo&s;er pa&s;&s;ions
ingrafted in every brea&s;t, are apt to reli&s;h and
excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Fathom had previou&s;ly reconnoitred the ground,
and di&s;covered &s;ome marks of inflammability in
Mademoi&s;elle's con&s;titution; her beauty was not
&s;uch as to engage her in tho&s;e gaieties of amu&s;e|ment,
which could flatter her vanity, and di&s;&s;i|pate
<PB N="44" REF="53">
her ideas; and &s;he was of an age, when
the little loves and young de&s;ires take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the fancy; he therefore concluded, that &s;he
had the more lei&s;ure to indulge tho&s;e inticing
images of plea&s;ure that youth never fails to cre|ate,
particularly in tho&s;e who, like her, were ad|dicted
to &s;olitude and &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Tere&s;a, full fraught with the wily injunction,
of her confederate, took the field, and opened
the campaign with &s;uch remarkable &s;ourne&s;s in
her a&s;pect, when Ferdinand appeared, that her
young lady could not help taking notice of her$
affected chag$in, and asked the rea&s;on of &s;uch
apparent alteration in her way of thinking. Pre|pared
for this que&s;tion, the other replied in a
manner calculated for giving Mademoi&s;elle to
under&s;tand, that whatever impre&s;&s;ions Ferdinand
might have formerly made on her heart, they
were now altogether effaced by the pride and
in&s;olence with which he had received her ad|vances;
and that her brea&s;t now glowed with
all the revenge of a &s;lighted lover.</P>
<P>To evince the &s;incerity of this declaration,
&s;he bitterly inveighed again&s;t him, and even af|fected
to depreciate tho&s;e talents, in which &s;he
knew his chief merit to con&s;i&s;t; hoping by
the&s;e means to intere&s;t Mademoi&s;elle's candour
in his defence. So far the train &s;ucceeded:
that young lady's natural love for truth was
offended at the calumnies that were vented a|gain&s;t
Ferdinand in his ab&s;ence. She c$id her
woman for the rancour of her remarks, and
undertook to refute the articles of his di&s;prai&s;e:
Tere&s;a &s;upported her own a&s;&s;ertions with great
ob&s;tinacy, and a di&s;pute en&s;ued, in which her
<PB N="45" REF="54">
mi&s;tre&s;s was $eated into &s;ome extravagant com|mendations
of our adventurer.</P>
<P>His &s;uppo&s;ed enemy did not fail to make a
report of her &s;ucce&s;s, and to magnify every ad|vantage
they had gained; believing in good
earne&s;t, that her lady's warmth was the effect
of a real pa&s;&s;ion for the fortunate Mr. Fathom:
but he him&s;elf viewed the adventure in a diffe|rent
light; and rightly imputed the violence of
Mademoi&s;elle's behaviour to the contradiction &s;he
had &s;u&s;tained from her maid; or to the fire of
her natural genero&s;ity, glowing in behalf of in|nocence
traduced. Neverthele&s;s, he was per|fectly
well plea&s;ed with the nature of the con|te&s;t;
becau&s;e, in the cour&s;e of &s;uch debates,
he fore&s;aw that he &s;hould become habitually her
hero, and that, in time, &s;he would actually be|lieve
tho&s;e exaggerations of his merit, which &s;he
her&s;elf had feigned for the honour of her own
arguments.</P>
<P>This pre&s;age, founded upon that principle of
&s;elf-re&s;pect, without which no individual exi&s;ts,
may certainly be ju&s;tified by manifold occurrences
in life: we our&s;elves have known a very preg|nant
example, which we &s;hall relate, for the
emolument of the reader. A certain needy au|thor
having found means to pre&s;ent a manu&s;cript
to one of tho&s;e &s;ons of fortune, who are digni|fied
with the appellation of patrons, in&s;tead of
reaping that applau&s;e, and advantage, with which
he had regaled his fancy, had the mortification
to find his performance treated with infinite ir|reverence
and contempt: and in high dudgeon
and di&s;appointment appealed to the judgment of
another critic, who, he knew, had no veneration
for the fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="55">
This common con&s;olation, to which all baffled
authors have recour&s;e, was productive of very
happy con&s;equences to our bard: for though the
opinions of both judges, concerning the piece,
were altogether the &s;ame, the latter, either out
of compa&s;&s;ion to the appellant, or de&s;ire of ren|dering
his rival ridiculous in the eye of ta&s;te,
undertook to repair the misfortune, and in this
manner executed the plan, in a meeting of lite|rati,
to which both the&s;e wits belonged; he who
had e&s;pou&s;ed the poet's cau&s;e, having previou&s;ly
de&s;ired another member to bring his compo&s;ition
on the carpet, no &s;ooner heard it mentioned,
than he began to cen&s;ure it with flagrant marks
of &s;corn, and with an ironical air looking at its
fir&s;t condemner, ob&s;erved that he mu&s;t be furi|ou&s;ly
infected with the rage of patronizing, who
could take &s;uch a deplorable performance into
his protection: the &s;arca&s;m took effect.</P>
<P>The per&s;on again&s;t whom it was levelled, tak|ing
umbrage at his pre&s;umption, a&s;&s;umed an a&s;|pect
of di&s;dain, and replied with great animo|&s;ity,
that nothing was more ea&s;ily &s;upported
than the character of a Zoilus, becau&s;e no pro|duction
was altogether free from blemi&s;hes, and
any man might pronounce again&s;t any piece by
the lump, without intere&s;ting his own di&s;cern|ment:
but to perceive the beauties of a work,
it was requi&s;ite to have learning, judgment and
ta&s;te; and therefore he did not wonder that the
gentleman had overlooked a great many in the
compo&s;ition which he &s;o contemptuou&s;ly decried.
A rejoinder &s;ucceeded this reply, and produced
a long train of altercation, in which the gen|tleman
who had formerly treated the book with
&s;uch di&s;re&s;pect, now pro&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf its pa&s;&s;ion|ate
<PB N="47" REF="56">
admirer, and held forth in prai&s;e of it with
great warmth and elocution.</P>
<P>Not contented with having exhibited this in|&s;tance
of regard, he next morning &s;ent a me&s;|&s;age
to the owner, importing that he had but
&s;uperficially glanced over the manu&s;cript, and
de&s;iring the favour of peru&s;ing it a &s;econd time;
being indulged in this reque&s;t, he recommended
it in terms of rapture, to all his friends and de|pendants,
and by dint of unwearied &s;ollicitation,
procured a very ample &s;ub&s;cription for the au|thor.</P>
<P>But, to re&s;ume the thread of our &s;tory: Te|re&s;a's
practices were not confined to &s;imple defa|mation:
her reproaches were contrived &s;o as to
imply &s;ome intelligence in favour of the per&s;on
&s;he reviled. In exemplifying his pertne&s;s and ar|rogance,
&s;he repeated his witty repartee; on pre|tence
of blaming his ferocity, &s;he recounted
proofs of his &s;pirit and prowe&s;s; and in explain|ing
the &s;ource of his vanity, gave her mi&s;tre&s;s to
under&s;tand, that a certain young lady of fa&s;hion
was &s;aid to be enamoured of his per&s;on. Nor
did this well-in&s;tructed under&s;trapper omit tho&s;e
other parts of her cue, which the principal judged
nece&s;&s;ary for the furtherance of his &s;cheme. Her
conver&s;ation became le&s;s guarded, and took a
$reer turn than u&s;ual: &s;he &s;eized all opportunities
of introducing little amorous &s;tories, the greate&s;t
part of which were invented for the purpo&s;es of
warming her pa&s;&s;ions, and lowering the price of
cha&s;tity in her e&s;teem; for, &s;he repre&s;ented all
the young lady's cotemporaries in point of age
and &s;ituation, as &s;o many &s;en&s;uali&s;ts, who with|out

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The confederates change their battery; and at|chieve
a remarkable adventure.</HEAD>
<P>THunder&s;truck at this di&s;appointment, the
confederates held a council, in order to
deliberate upon the next mea&s;ures that &s;hould be
taken; and Ferdinand, for the pre&s;ent, de&s;pair|ing
of accompli&s;hing his grand aim, re&s;olved to
profit in another manner, by the conveniency
of his &s;ituation. He repre&s;ented to his help|mate,
that it would be prudent for them to
make hay while the &s;un &s;hone, as their connexi|on
might be &s;ooner or later di&s;covered, and an
end put to all tho&s;e opportunities which they
now &s;o happily enjoyed. All principles of mo|rality
had been already excluded from their for|mer
plan; con&s;equently, he found it an ea&s;y
ta&s;k to intere&s;t Tere&s;a in any other &s;cheme tend|ing
to their mutual advantage, how&s;oever wicked
and perfidious it might be. He therefore, per|&s;uaded
her to be his auxiliary in defrauding Ma|demoi&s;elle
at play, and gave her &s;uitable direc|tions
<PB N="50" REF="59">
for that purpo&s;e; and even tutored her
how to abu&s;e the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in her, by em|bezzling
the young lady's effects, without in|curring
the &s;u&s;picion of di&s;hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>On the &s;uppo&s;ition that every &s;ervant in the
hou&s;e, was not able to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch temptation,
the pur&s;e of her mi&s;tre&s;s (to which the maid had
always acce&s;s) was dropped in a pa&s;&s;age, which
the dome&s;tics had occa&s;ion to frequent, and Fa|thom
po&s;ted him&s;elf in a convenient place, in
order to ob&s;erve the effect of his &s;tratagem.
Here he was not di&s;appointed in his conjecture.
The fir&s;t per&s;on who chanced to pa&s;s that way,
was one of the chambermaids, with whom Te|re&s;a
had lived, for &s;ome time, in a &s;tate of inve|terate
enmity, becau&s;e the wench had failed in
that homage and re&s;pect which was paid to her
by the re&s;t of the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Ferdinand had in his heart e&s;pou&s;ed the quar|rel
of his a&s;&s;ociate, and longed for an occa&s;ion
to deliver her from the malicious ob&s;ervance of
&s;uch an antagoni&s;t; when he therefore, &s;aw her
approach, his heart throbbed with joyful expec|tations;
but, when &s;he &s;natched up the pur&s;e,
and thru&s;t it in her bo&s;om, with all the eager|ne&s;s
and confu&s;ion of one determined to appro|priate
the windfall to her own u&s;e, his tran&s;ports
were altogether un&s;peakable. He traced her to
her own apartment, whither &s;he immediately
retreated with great trepidation, and then com|municated
the di&s;covery to Tere&s;a, together
with in&s;tructions how to behave in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>In conformity with the&s;e le&s;&s;ons, &s;he took
the $word$ opportunity of going to Mademoi&s;elle,
and demanding money for &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary ex|pence,
that the lo&s;s might be known, before the
<PB N="51" REF="60">
finder could have lei&s;ure to make any fre&s;h con|veyance
of the prize; and in the mean time,
Ferdinand kept a &s;trict eye upon the motions of
the chambermaid. The young lady having rum|maged
her pockets in vain, expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;ur|prize
at the lo&s;s of her pur&s;e, upon which her
attendant gave indications of extreme amaze|ment
and concern; &s;he &s;aid, it could not po&s;&s;ibly
be lo&s;t; intreated her to &s;earch her e&s;crutore,
while &s;he her&s;elf ran about the room, prying into
every corner, with all the &s;ymptoms of fear and
di&s;traction. Having made this un&s;ucce&s;sful in|quiry,
&s;he pretended to &s;hed a flood of tears,
bewailing her own fate, in being near the per&s;on
of any lady, who met with &s;uch a misfortune,
by which, &s;he ob&s;erved, her character might be
called in que&s;tion: &s;he produced her own keys,
and begged upon her knees, that her chamber
and boxes might be &s;earched without delay.</P>
<P>In a word, &s;he demeaned her&s;elf &s;o artfully,
upon this occa&s;ion, that her mi&s;tre&s;s, who never
entertained the lea&s;t doubt of her integrity, now
looked upon her as a miracle of fidelity and at|tachment,
and was at infinite pains to con&s;ole
her for the accident which had happened; pro|te&s;ting
that for her own part, the lo&s;s of
the money &s;hould never affect her with a mo|ment's
unea&s;ine&s;s, if &s;he could retrieve a certain
medal which &s;he had long kept in her pur&s;e, as
a remembrance of her decea&s;ed aunt, from whom
&s;he received it in a pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Fathom entered accidentally in the mid&s;t
of this well-acted &s;cene, and perceiving the agi|tation
of the maid, and the concern of the mi&s;|tre&s;s,
de&s;ired, in a re&s;pectful manner, to know
the cau&s;e of their di&s;order. Before the young
<PB N="52" REF="61">
lady had time to make him acquainted with the
circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, his accomplice ex|claimed
in an affected pa&s;&s;ion, &startq;Mr. Fathom,
my lady has lo&s;t her pur&s;e; and as no per&s;ons in
the family are &s;o much about her, as you and I,
you mu&s;t give me leave in my own ju&s;tification,
to in&s;i&s;t upon Mademoi&s;elle's ordering the apart|ments
of us both to be &s;earched without lo&s;s of
time: here are my pockets and my keys, and
you cannot &s;cruple to give her the &s;ame &s;atisfac|tion;
for innocence has nothing to fear.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Melvile reprimanded her &s;harply for her
unmannerly zeal; and Ferdinand eying her with
a look of di&s;dain, &startq;Madam, &s;aid he, I approve
of your propo&s;al; but before I undergo &s;uch
mortification, I would advi&s;e Mademoi&s;elle to
&s;ubject the two chambermaids to &s;uch inquiry:
as they al&s;o have acce&s;s to the apartments, and
are, I apprehend, as likely as you or I, to be|have
in &s;uch a &s;candalous manner.</P>
<P>The young lady declared that &s;he was too
well &s;atisfied of Tere&s;a's hone&s;ty and Ferdinand's
honour, to harbour the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of either,
and that &s;he would &s;ooner die than di&s;grace them
&s;o far as to comply with the propo&s;al the former
had made; but as &s;he &s;aw no rea&s;on for exempt|ing
the inferior &s;ervants from that examination,
which Fathom advi&s;ed, &s;he would forthwith put
it in execution. The chambermaids being ac|cordingly
&s;ummoned, &s;he calmly a&s;ked if either
of them had accidentally found the pur&s;e &s;he
had dropped, and both replying in the negative,
&s;he a&s;&s;umed an air of &s;everity and determination,
and demanding their keys, threatned to examine
$heir trunks on the in&s;tant.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="62">
The guilty Abigail, who, though an Hunga|rian,
was not inferior, in point of effrontery, to
any one of the &s;i&s;terhood in England, no &s;ooner
heard this menace, than &s;he affected an air of
affronted innocence, thanked God &s;he had lived
in many reputable families, and been tru&s;ted with
untold gold; but was never before &s;u&s;pected
of theft; that the other maid might do as &s;he
&s;hould think proper, and be mean-&s;pirited enough
to let her things be tumbled top&s;y-turvy and ex|po&s;ed;
but, for her own part, if &s;he &s;hould be

&s;he would not &s;tay another hour in the hou&s;e;

the greate&s;t &s;hare of her favour, than be|lieve
their malicious in&s;inuations again&s;t innocent
people whom they were well known to hate and
defame.</P>
<P>This declaration implying an hint to the pre|judice
of Tere&s;a, far from diverting mi&s;s Mel|vile
from her purpo&s;e, &s;erved only to inhance
the character of the accu&s;ed in her opinion, and
to confirm her &s;u&s;picion of the accu&s;er, of whom
&s;he again demanded her keys, prote&s;ting, that
&s;hould &s;he prove refractory, the count him&s;elf
&s;hould take cognizance of the affair, whereas if
&s;he would deal ingenuou&s;ly, &s;he &s;hould have no
cau&s;e to repent of her confe&s;&s;ion. So &s;aying, &s;he
de&s;ired our adventurer to take the trouble of
calling up &s;ome of the men &s;ervants; upon which
the con&s;cious criminal began to tremble, and
falling upon her knees, acknowledged her guilt,

<P>UNder this &s;ecure cover, Tere&s;a levied con|tributions
upon her mi&s;tre&s;s with great
&s;ucce&s;s. Some trinket was mi&s;&s;ing every day;

for the jewels were valued at five hun|dred
florins.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle was accordingly alarmed to &s;uch
a degree, that &s;he made her mother acquainted
with her lo&s;s, and that good lady, who was an
excellent oeconomi&s;t, did not fail to give indica|tions
of extraordinary concern. She a&s;ked, if
her daughter had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect any indi|vidual

confident of her own woman's integrity: upon
which Mademoi&s;elle, with many encomiums o$

underwent a &s;trict enquiry, and was
even committed to pri&s;on, on the &s;trength of her

in&s;i&s;ted upon undergoing the &s;ame tryal with

After a fruitle&s;s inquiry, the pri&s;oner was di&s;|charged

morals, he did not &s;cruple to unbo&s;om him&s;elf
on that &s;ubject to Ferdinand, who&s;e &s;agacity and

patron, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the mo&s;t pa|thetic

Renaldo (that was the youth's name) not only
as a companion, but a preceptor and pattern;
conjured him to a&s;&s;i&s;t his tutor in &s;uperintending
his conduct, and to reinforce the governor's
precepts, by his own example; to inculcate
upon him, the mo&s;t delicate punctilio's of ho|nour,
and decoy him into extravagance, rather
than leave the lea&s;t illiberal &s;entiment in his

<P>Our crafty adventurer, with demon&s;trations

great goodne&s;s of the count in repo&s;ing &s;uch

While preparations were making for
their departure, our hero held a council with his

eighteenth year of his age, with Renaldo and
his governor, who were provided with letters of
recommendation to &s;ome of the count's friends
belonging to the imperial court.</P>
<P>Such a favourable introduction could not fail
of being advantageous to a youth of Ferdinand's
&s;pecious accompli&s;hments; for he was con&s;ider|ed
as the young count's companion, admitted
into his parties, and included in all the enter|tainments
to which Renaldo was invited. He

in the cour&s;e of tho&s;e exerci&s;es that were
taught at the academy of which he was pupil;
his manners were &s;o engaging as to attract the

being &s;prightly and inoffen&s;ive, grew
into very great reque&s;t; in a word, he and the
young count formed a remarkable contra&s;t, which
in the eye of the world, redounded to his advan|tage.</P>
<P>They were certainly, in all re&s;pects, the re|ver&s;e
of each other. Renaldo, under a total
defect of exterior cultivation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t
excellent under&s;tanding, with every virtue that
dignifies the human heart; while the other,
beneath a mo&s;t agreeable out&s;ide, with an in|aptitude
and aver&s;ion to letters, concealed an
amazing fund of villainy and ingr$titude. Hi|therto,
his ob&s;ervation had been confined to a
narrow &s;phere, and his reflections, though &s;ur|prizingly
ju&s;t and acute, had not attained to that
maturity, which age and experience give: but
<PB N="58" REF="67">
now, his perceptions began to be more di&s;tinct,
and extended to a thou&s;and objects which had
never before come under his cognizance.</P>
<P>He had formerly imagined, but was now fully
per&s;uaded, that the &s;ons of men preyed upon one
another, and &s;uch was the end and condition
of their being. Among the principal figures of
life, he ob&s;erved few or no characters that did
not bear a &s;trong analogy to the &s;avage tyrants of
the wood. One re&s;embled a tyger in fury and
rapaciou&s;ne&s;s; a &s;econd prowled about like an
hungry wolf, &s;eeking whom he might devour;
a third acted the part of a jackall, in beating the
bu&s;h for game to his voracious employer; and
a fourth imitated the wily fox, in practi&s;ing a
thou&s;and crafty ambu&s;cades for the de&s;truction
of the ignorant and unwary. This la&s;t was the
department of life for which he found him&s;elf
be&s;t qualified, by nature and inclination, and he
accordingly re&s;olved that his talent &s;hould not
ru&s;t in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He was already pretty well
ver&s;ed in all the &s;ciences of play; but, he had
every day, occa&s;ion to &s;ee the&s;e arts carried to
&s;uch a &s;urpri&s;ing pitch of fine&s;&s;e and dexterity,
as di&s;couraged him from building his &s;chemes on
that $oundation.</P>
<P>He therefore determined to fa&s;cinate the judg|ment,
rather than the eyes of his fellow-crea|tures,
by a continual exerci&s;e of that gift of de|ceiving,
with which he knew him&s;elf endued to
an unrivalled degree; and to acquire unbounded
influence with tho&s;e who might be &s;ub&s;ervient
to his intere&s;t, by an a$$iduous application to
their prevailing pa&s;&s;ions. Not that play was al|together
left out in the projection of his occo|nomy:
though he engaged him&s;elf very little in
<PB N="59" REF="68">
the executive part of gaming, he had not been
long in Vienna, when he entered into league
with a genius of that kind, whom he di&s;tingui&s;hed
among the pupils of the academy, and who
indeed, had taken up his habitation in that place,
with a view to pillage the provincials on their
fir&s;t arrival in town, before they could be arm|ed
with proper circum&s;pection to pre&s;erve their
money, or have time to di&s;po&s;e of it in any other
&s;hape.</P>
<P>Similar characters naturally attract each other,
and people of our hero's principles are, of all
others, the mo&s;t apt to di&s;tingui&s;h their own
likene&s;s where&s;oever it occurs; becau&s;e they al|ways
keep the faculty of di&s;cerning in full ex|ertion.
It was in con&s;equence of this mutual
alertne&s;s, that Ferdinand and the &s;tranger, who
was a native of Tyrol, perceived them&s;elves
reflected in the di&s;po&s;itions of each other, and
immediately entered into an offen&s;ive and de|fen&s;ive
alliance: our adventurer undertaking for
the articles of intelligence, countenance and
coun&s;el; and his a&s;&s;ociate charging him&s;elf with
the ri&s;que of execution.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The game&s;ter no &s;ooner received this intima|tion,
than according to the plan which had been
preconcerted betwixt the author and him, he
<PB N="61" REF="70">
went to the apartment of Renaldo, and pre&s;ent|ing
the &s;um of money which he had defrauded
him of, the preceding night, told him with a
&s;tern countenance, that though it was a ju&s;t ac|qui&s;ition,
he &s;corned to avail him&s;elf of his good
fortune again&s;t any per&s;on who entertained the
&s;malle&s;t doubt of his honour.</P>
<P>The young count, &s;urprized at this addre&s;s,
rejected his offer with di&s;dain, and de&s;ired to
know the meaning of &s;uch an unexpected declara|tion.
Upon which, the other produced Ferdi|nand's
billet, and threatned in very high terms,
to meet the &s;tripling according to his invitation,
and cha&s;tise him &s;everely for his pre&s;umption.
The con&s;equence of this explanation is obvious.
Renaldo imputing the officiou&s;ne&s;s of Fathom to
the zeal of his friend&s;hip, interpo&s;ed in the quar|rel,
which was amicably compromi&s;ed, not a lit|tle
to the honour of our adventurer, who thus
obtained an opportunity of di&s;playing his cou|rage
and integrity, without the lea&s;t hazard to
his per&s;on; while at the &s;ame time, his confe|derate
recommended him&s;elf to the e&s;teem of the
young count, by his &s;pirited behaviour on this
occa&s;ion; &s;o that Rinaldo being le&s;s &s;hy of his
company for the future, the Tyroleze had the
fairer opportunities to pro&s;ecute his de&s;igns upon
the young gentleman's pur&s;e.</P>
<P>It would be almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to &s;ay that the&s;e
were not neglected. The &s;on of count Melvile
was not deficient in point of penetration: but,
his whole &s;tudy was at that time, engro&s;&s;ed by
the care of his education; and he had &s;ometimes
recour&s;e to play, as to an amu&s;ement by which
he &s;ought to unbend the &s;everity of his attention:
no wonder then, that he fell a prey to an artful
<PB N="62" REF="71">
game&s;ter, who had been regularly trained to the
profe&s;&s;ion, and made it the &s;ole &s;tudy of his life;
e&s;pecially as the Hungarian was remarkable for
a warmth of temper, which a knight of the po&s;t
always knows how to manage for his own ad|vantage.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e operations, Fathom
was a very u&s;eful corre&s;pondent; he in&s;tructed
the Tyroleze in the peculiarities of Renaldo's
di&s;po&s;ition, and made him acquainted with the
proper &s;ea&s;ons for profiting by his dexterity.
Ferdinand, for example, who by the authority
derived to him from the injunctions of the old
count, &s;ometimes took upon him&s;elf the office
of an advi&s;er, cunningly cho&s;e to coun&s;el the
&s;on, at tho&s;e conjunctures, when he knew him
lea&s;t able to bear &s;uch expo&s;tulation. Advice
improperly admini&s;tred, generally acts in diame|trical
oppo&s;ition to the purpo&s;e for which it is
&s;uppo&s;ed to be given: at lea&s;t this was the ca&s;e
with the young gentleman, who inflamed by the
reproof of &s;uch a tutor, u&s;ed to obey the dic|tates
of his re&s;entment, in an immediate repe|tition
of that conduct which our adventurer had
taken the liberty to di&s;approve; and the game|&s;ter
was always at hand, to mini&s;ter unto his
indignation. By the&s;e means he was di&s;encum|bered
of divers con&s;iderable remittances, with
which his father chearfully &s;upplied him, on the
&s;uppo&s;ition that they were &s;pent with ta&s;te and
liberality, under the direction of our adven|turer.</P>
<P>But Ferdinand's views were not confined to
the narrow field of this alliance: he attempted
divers enterprizes in the world of gallantry, con|&s;cious
of his own per&s;onal qualifications, and never
<PB N="63" REF="72">
doubting that he could in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the
good graces of &s;ome married lady about court,
or lay an opulent dowager under contribution.
But he met with an ob&s;tacle in his endeavours
of this kind, which all his art was unable to
&s;urmount. This was no other than the ob&s;cu|rity
of his birth, and the want of a title, with|out
which no per&s;on in that country lays claim
to the privileges of a gentleman. Had he fore|&s;een
this inconvenience, he might have made
&s;hift to obviate the con&s;equences, by obtaining
permi&s;&s;ion to appear in the character of the
count's kin&s;man: though, in all probability, &s;uch
an expedient would not have been extremely
agreeable to the old gentleman, who was very
tenacious of the honour of his family: never|thele&s;s,
his genero&s;ity might have been prevailed
upon, to indulge Fathom with &s;uch a pretext,
in con&s;ideration of the youth's &s;uppo&s;ed attach|ment,
and the obligations for which he deemed
him&s;elf indebted to his decea&s;ed mother.</P>
<P>True it is, Ferdinand, upon his fir&s;t arrival
at Vienna, had been admitted into fa&s;hionable
company, on the footing of Renaldo's compa|nion,
becau&s;e no body &s;u&s;pected the defect of
his pedigree; and even after a report had been
circulated to the prejudice of his extraction, by
the indu&s;try of a lacquey who attended the young
count, there were not wanting many young peo|ple
of di&s;tinction, who &s;till favoured him with
their countenance and corre&s;pondence: but, he
was no longer invited to private families, in
which only he could expect to profit by
his addre&s;s among the ladies, and had the morti|fication
of finding him&s;elf frequently excepted
from parties which were expre&s;ly calculated for
<PB N="64" REF="73">
the entertainment of the young count. Luckily,
his &s;pirit was &s;o pliant as to &s;u&s;tain the&s;e &s;lights,
without being much dejected: in&s;tead of repin|ing
at the lo&s;s of that re&s;pect which had been
paid to him at fir&s;t, he endeavoured with all
his might, to pre&s;erve the little that &s;till remain|ed,
and re&s;olyed to tran&s;late into an humblet
&s;phere, that gallantry which he had no longer
opportunities of di&s;playing in the world of ran$
and fa&s;hion.</P>

<P>IN con&s;equence of this determination, he to

the few friends of con&s;equence his fortun$
had left, and even carried his complai&s;ance &s;o

thought his talents would &s;hine more con&s;picuous
than at the a&s;&s;emblies of the great, and conduce
more effectually to the intere&s;t of all his de&s;igns.
Nor did he find him&s;elf di&s;appointed in that ex|pectation,
&s;anguine as it was. He &s;oon found
means to be introduced to the hou&s;e of a weal|thy
bourgeois, where every individual was
charmed with his ea&s;y air and extraordinary qua|lifications.
He accommodated him&s;elf &s;urpri|&s;ingly
to the humours of the whole family;
&s;moaked tobacco, &s;wallowed wine and di&s;cour&s;ed
of &s;tones with the husband, who was a rich jew|eller;
&s;acrificed him&s;elf to the pride and loqua|city
<PB N="65" REF="74">
of the wife, and played upon the violin,
and &s;ung alternately, for the amu&s;ement of his
only daughter, a buxom la&s;s, nearly of his own
age, the fruit of a former marriage.</P>
<P>It was not long before Ferdinand had rea&s;on
to congratulate him&s;elf on the footing he had
gained in this &s;ociety. He had expected to find,
and in a little time actually di&s;covered that mu|tual
jealou&s;y and rancour, which almo&s;t always
&s;ub&s;i&s;t between a daughter and her &s;tep dame,
inflamed with all the virulence of female emu|lation;
for the di&s;parity in their ages, &s;erved
only to render them the more inveterate rivals
in the de&s;ire of captivating the other &s;ex. Our
adventurer having deliberated upon the means of
converting this animo&s;ity to his own advantage,
&s;aw no method for this purpo&s;e &s;o fea&s;ible, as
that of making his approaches to the hearts of
both, by mini&s;tring to each in private, food for
their reciprocal envy and malevolence: becau&s;e
he well knew that no road lies &s;o direct and open
to a woman's heart, as that of grati$ying her
pa&s;&s;ions of vanity and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>When he had an opportunity of being parti|cular
with the mother, he expre&s;&s;ed his concern
for having unwittingly incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of
Mademoi&s;elle, which, he ob&s;erved, was obvious
in every circum&s;tance of her behaviour towards
him; prote&s;ting he was utterly innocent of
all intention of offending her; and that he
could not account for his di&s;grace, any other
way, than by &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he took umbrage at the
direction of his chief regards towards her mo|ther-in-law,
which, he owned, was altogether
involuntary, being wholly influenced by that
lady's &s;uperior charms and politene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="75">
Such a declaration was perfectly well calculated
for the meridian of a dame like her, who with
all the intoxication of unenlightened pride, an$
an increa&s;ed appetite for plea&s;ure, had begun to
find her&s;elf neglected, and even to believe that
her attractions were actually in the wane. She
very graciou&s;ly con&s;oled our gallant for the mi&s;|hap
of which he complained; repre&s;enting Wil|hemina
(that was the daughter's name) as a pert,
illiterate, envious baggage, of who&s;e di&s;gu&s;t he
ought to make no con&s;ideration; then &s;he re|counted
many in&s;tances of her own genero&s;ity
to that young lady, with the returns of malice
and ingratitude &s;he had made; and la&s;tly, enu|merated
all the imperfections of her per&s;on, edu|cation,
and behaviour; that he might &s;ee with
what ju&s;tice the gyp&s;y pretended to vye with
tho&s;e who had been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appro|bation,
and even gallantry of the be&s;t people in
Vienna.</P>
<P>Having thus e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf her confident
and go&s;&s;ip, he knew his next &s;tep of promotion
would nece&s;&s;arily be to the degree of her lover;
and in that belief, re&s;olved to play the &s;ame
game with Mademoi&s;elle Wilhelmina, who&s;e
complexion was very much a-kin to that of her
&s;tep-mother: indeed they re&s;embled each other
too much to live upon any terms of friend&s;hip or
even decorum. Fathom, in order to enjoy a
private conver&s;ation with the young lady, never
failed to repeat his vi&s;it every afternoon, 'till at
length, he had the plea&s;ure of finding her di&s;en|gaged,
the jeweller being occupied among his
workmen, and his wife gone to a&s;&s;i&s;t at a
lying-in.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="76">
Our adventurer and the daughter had already
exchanged their vows, by the expre&s;&s;ive language
of the eyes; he had even declared him&s;elf in
&s;ome tender ejaculations which had been &s;oftly
whi&s;pered in her ear, when he could &s;natch an
opportunity of venting them, unperceived; nay,
he had upon divers occa&s;ions, gently &s;queezed
her fair hand, on pretence of tuning her harp&s;i|chord,
and been favoured with returns of the
&s;ame cordial pre&s;&s;ure: &s;o that in&s;tead of acco&s;t|ing
her with the fearful he&s;itation and re&s;erve of
a timid &s;wain, he told her, after the exerci&s;e of
the doux-yeux, that he was come to confer with
her upon a &s;ubject that nearly concerned her
peace; and a&s;ked if &s;he had not ob&s;erved of late,
an evident abatement of friend&s;hip in her mo|ther's
behaviour to him, whom &s;he had formerly
treated with &s;uch marks of favour and re&s;pect.
Mademoi&s;elle would not pay &s;o ill a compliment
to her own di&s;cernment as to &s;ay &s;he had not
perceived the alteration, which, on the contrary,
&s;he owned was extremely palpable; nor was it
difficult to divine the cau&s;e of &s;uch e&s;tranged
looks. This remark was accompanied with an
irre&s;i&s;tible glance, &s;he &s;miled inchanting, the
colour deepened on her cheeks, her brea&s;t be|gan
to heave, and her whole frame underwent
a mo&s;t agreeable confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ferdinand was not a man to let &s;uch a favour|able
conjuncture pa&s;s unregarded. &startq;Yes,
charming Wilhelmina! exclaimed the politician
in an affected rapture, the cau&s;e is as con&s;picu|ous
as your attractions. She hath in &s;pite of all
my circum&s;pection, perceived that pa&s;&s;ion which
it is not in my power to conceal, and in con&s;e|quence
of which, I now declare my&s;elf your
<PB N="68" REF="77">
devoted adorer; or, con&s;cious of your &s;uperior
excellence, her jealou&s;y hath taken the alarm,
and though &s;tung with conjecture only, repine$
at the triumph of your perfections. How far
this &s;pirit of malignity may be inflamed to my
prejudice, I know not: perhaps as this is the
fir&s;t, it may be al&s;o the la&s;t opportunity, I &s;hall
have of avowing the deare&s;t &s;entiments of my
heart, to the fair object that in&s;pired them; in a
word, I may be for ever excluded from your pre|fence.
Excu&s;e me then, divine creature! from
the practice of tho&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary forms, which I
&s;hould take pride in ob&s;erving, were I indulged
with the ordinary privileges of an honourable
lover; and once for all, accept the homage of
an heart overflowing with love and admiration.
Yes, adorable Wilhelmina! I am dazzled with
your &s;upernatural beauty; your other accompli&s;h|ments
&s;trike me with wonder and awe. I am
enchanted by the graces of your deportment&punc;
ravi&s;hed with the charms of your conver&s;ation&punc;
and there is a certain tenderne&s;s of benevolence
in that endearing a&s;pect, which, I tru&s;t will not
fail to melt with &s;ympathy at the emotions of a
faithful &s;lave like me.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he threw him&s;elf upon his knees,
and &s;eizing her plump hand, pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips
with all the violence of real tran&s;port. The
nymph, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions nature had filled to the
brim, could not $ear &s;uch a rhap&s;ody unmoved:
being an utter &s;tranger to addre&s;&s;es of this kind,
&s;he under&s;tood every word of it, in the literal
acceptation; &s;he believed implicitly in the truth
of the encomiums he had be&s;towed, and thought
it rea&s;onable he &s;hould be rewarded for the ju&s;|tice
he had done to her qualifications, which
<PB N="69" REF="78">
had hitherto been almo&s;t altogether over-looked:
in &s;hort, her heart began to thaw, and her face
to hang out the flag of capitulation, which was
no &s;ooner perceived b$ our hero, than he re|newed
his attack with redoubled fervour, pro|nouncing
in a mo&s;t vehement tone, &startq;Light of
my eyes, and empre&s;s of my &s;oul! behold me
pro&s;trate at your feet, waiting with the mo&s;t
pious re&s;ignation, for that &s;entence from your

mu&s;t altogether depend. Not with more reve|rence
does the unhappy ba&s;haw ki&s;s the Sultan's

ma&s;ter, and &s;hed the blood of the true&s;t heart
that ever felt the cruel pangs of di&s;appointed
love.&endq;</P>
<P>The young lady, well nigh overcome by this
effu&s;ion, which brought the tears into her eyes,
&startq;Enough, enough, cried &s;he, interrupting him,
&s;ure you men were created for the ruin of our
&s;ex.&endq; &startq;Ruin, re-ecchoed Fathom, talk not of

&s;hall wait upon her enemies, if &s;uch there be,
and tho&s;e love-lorn wretches who pine with
angui&s;h under her di&s;dain$ grant me, kind
$eaven a more propitious boon: direct her ge|nial

&s;treams: and if I prove untrue, ah! let me
never find a &s;olitary willow or a bubling brook,
by help of which I may be enabled to put a
period to my wretched life.&endq;</P>
<P>Here this excellent actor began to &s;ob mo&s;t
piteou&s;ly, and the tender-hearted Wilhelmina, un|able
longer to with&s;tand his moving tale, with a
repetition of the interjection ah! gently dropp'd
into his arms. This was the beginning of a
corre&s;pondence that &s;oon ro&s;e to a very intere&s;t|ing
pitch; and they forthwith concerted mea|&s;ures
for carrying it on, without the knowledge
or &s;u&s;picion of her mother-in-law. Neverthe|le&s;s
the young lady, vanqui&s;hed as &s;he was, and
unskilled in the ways of men, would not all at
once yield at di&s;cretion; but in&s;i&s;ted upon tho&s;e
terms, without which no woman's reputation
can be &s;ecured. Our lover far from &s;eeking to
evade the propo&s;al, a&s;&s;ented to it in terms of
uncommon &s;atisfaction, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e his
whole indu&s;try in finding a prie&s;t, upon who&s;e
di&s;cretion they could rely; nay, he certainly
re&s;olved to comply with her reque&s;t in good
earne&s;t, rather than forfeit the advantages which
he fore&s;aw in their union. His good fortune,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is expo&s;ed to a mo&s;t perilous incident in the
cour&s;e of his intrigue with the daughter.</HEAD>
<P>HE was rejoiced to find her &s;o ea&s;ily &s;atisfied
in &s;uch a momentous concern: for the
principal aim of the intrigue was to make her
nece&s;&s;ary to his intere&s;ted views, and even, if
po&s;&s;ible, an a&s;&s;ociate in the fraudulent plans he
had projected upon her father; con&s;equently he
con&s;idered this relaxation in her virtue, as an
happy omen of his future &s;ucce&s;s. All the ob|&s;tacles
to their mutual enjoyment being thus re|moved,
our adventurer was by his mi&s;tre&s;s, in|dulged
with an a&s;&s;ignation in her own chamber,
which, though contiguous to that of her &s;tep|mother,
was provided with a door that opened
into a common &s;tair-ca&s;e, to which he had ac|ce&s;s
at all hours of the night.</P>
<P>He did not neglect the rendezvous, but, pre|&s;enting
him&s;elf at the appointed time, which
was midnight, made the &s;ignal they had agreed
upon, and was immediately admitted by Wil|helmina,
who waited for him with a lover's im|patience.
Fathom was not deficient in tho&s;e
expre&s;&s;ions of rapture, that are current on &s;uch
occa&s;ions; but, on the contrary, became &s;o
loud in the tran&s;ports of &s;elf-congratulation, that
his voice reached the ears of the vigilant &s;tep|mother,
who wakening the jeweller from his
<PB N="72" REF="81">
fir&s;t nap, gave him to under&s;tand that &s;o$$
per&s;on was certainly in clo&s;e conver&s;atio$
with his daughter; and exhorted him to $word$
forthwith, and vindicate the honour of his fa|mily.</P>
<P>The German, who was naturally of a phleg|matic
habit, and never went to bed without$
full do&s;e of the creature, which added to $word$
con&s;titutional drow&s;ine&s;s, gave no ear to his wife$
intimation, until &s;he had repeated it thrice, an$
u&s;ed other means to rou&s;e him from the arms $word$
&s;lumber. Mean while, Fathom and his inamo$
rata overheard her information, and our he$
would have made his retreat immediately, throug$$
the port by which he entered, had not his inten|tion
been over-ruled by the remon&s;trances $word$
the young lady, who ob&s;erved that the door $word$
already fa&s;t bolted, and could not po&s;&s;ibly b$
opened without creating a noi&s;e that would con|firm
the &s;u&s;picion of her parents; and that over
and above this objection, he would, in &s;allying
from that door, run the ri&s;que of being met by
her father, who in all probability, would pre&s;e$
him&s;elf be&s;ore it, in order to hinder our hero'$
e&s;cape: &s;he therefore conveyed him &s;oftly int$
her clo&s;et, where &s;he a&s;&s;ured him he might re|main
with great tranquillity, in full confidence
that &s;he would take &s;uch mea&s;ures, as would effec|tually
&s;creen him from detection.</P>
<P>He was fain to depend upon her a&s;&s;urance, an$
accordingly in&s;conced him&s;elf behind her dre&s;s$ing
table; but he could not help &s;weating with$
apprehen&s;ion, and praying &s;ervently to God for
his deliverance, when he heard the jewelle$
thundring at the door, and calling to his daugh|ter
for admittance. Wilhel$$$, who was already
<PB N="73" REF="82">
undre&s;&s;ed, and had purpo&s;ely extingui&s;hed the
light, pretended to be &s;uddenly waked from her
&s;leep, and &s;tarting up, exclaimed in a tone of
&s;urprize and affright, &startq;Je&s;u, Maria! what is
the matter?&endq; Hu&s;&s;ey! replied the German in a
terrible accent, open the door this in&s;tant, there
is a man in your bed-chamber; and by the light|ning
and thunder! I will wa&s;h away the &s;tain he
has ca&s;t upon my honour with the &s;chellum's
heart's-blood.</P>
<P>Not at all intimidated by this boi&s;terous threat,
&s;he admitted him without he&s;itation, and with
a &s;hrillne&s;s of voice peculiar to her&s;elf, began to
hold forth upon her own innocence and his
unju&s;t &s;u&s;picion, mingling in her harangue, &s;un|dry
oblique hints again&s;t her mother in law,
importing that &s;ome people were &s;o vitiou&s;ly
inclined by their own natures, that &s;he did not
wonder at their doubting the virtue of other
people; but that the&s;e people de&s;pi&s;ed the in&s;i|nuations
of &s;uch people, who ought to be more
circum&s;pect in their own conduct, le&s;t they
them&s;elves &s;hould &s;uffer repri&s;als from tho&s;e peo|ple
whom they had &s;o maliciou&s;ly &s;landered.</P>
<P>Having uttered the&s;e flowers of rhetoric, which
were calculated for the hearing of her &s;tep-dame,
who &s;tood with a light at her hu&s;band's back,
the young lady a&s;&s;umed an ironical air, and ad|moni&s;hed
her father to &s;earch every corner of
her apartment; &s;he even affected to a&s;&s;i&s;t his
inquiry; with her own hands pulled out a par|cel
of &s;mall drawers, in which her $word$ inkets were
contained; de&s;ired him to look into her needle
ca&s;e and thimble, and &s;eeing his examination
fruitle&s;s, earne&s;tly intreated him to rummage her
clo&s;et al&s;o, &s;aying with a &s;neer, that in all pro|bability,
<PB N="74" REF="83">
the di&s;honourer would be &s;ound in that
lurking-place. The manner in which &s;he pre|tended
to ridicule his apprehen&s;ions, made an
impre&s;&s;ion upon the jeweller, who was very
well di&s;po&s;ed to retreat into his own ne&s;t, when
his wife, with a certain &s;lyne&s;s in her counte|nance,
be&s;ought him to comply with his daugh$ter's
reque&s;t, and look into that &s;ame clo&s;et;
by which means Wilhelmina's virtue would ob|tain
a compleat triumph.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, who overheard the conver|&s;ation,
was immediately &s;eized with a pal&s;y of
fear: he trembled at every joint, the &s;weat
trickled down his forehead, his teeth began to
chatter, his hair to &s;tand on end, and he in his
heart, bitterly cur&s;ed the daughter's petu|lance,
the mother's malice, together with his
own precipitation, by which he was involved
in an adventure &s;o pregnant with danger
and di&s;grace. Indeed, the reader may ea&s;ily
conceive his di&s;order, when he heard the key
turning in the lock, and the German &s;wearing
that he would make him food for the bea&s;ts of
the field and the fowls of the air.</P>
<P>Fathom had come unprepared with weapons
of defence, was naturally an oeconomi&s;t of his
per&s;on, and &s;aw him&s;elf on the brink of forfeit|ing
not only the promi&s;ed harve&s;t of his double
intrigue, but al&s;o the reputation of a man of
honour, upon which all his future hopes depend$ed:
his agony was therefore un&s;peakable, when
the door flew open, and it was not till after a
con&s;iderable pau&s;e of recollection, that he per|ceived
the candle extingui&s;hed by the motion of
the air produced from the German's &s;udden irrup|tion.
This accident, which di&s;concerted him &s;o
<PB N="75" REF="84">
much as to put a full &s;top to his charge, was
very favourable to our hero, who &s;ummoning
all his pre&s;ence of mind, crept up into the chim|ney,
while the jeweller &s;tood at the door, wait|ing
for his wife's return with another light; &s;o
that when the clo&s;et was examined, there was
nothing found to ju&s;tify the report which the
&s;tep-mother had made; and the father, after hav|ing
made a &s;light apology to Wilhelmina, for
his intr$&s;ion, retired with his yoke-fellow into
their own chamber.</P>
<P>The young lady who little thought that her
papa would have taken her at her word, was
overwhelmed with confu&s;ion and di&s;may, when
&s;he &s;aw him enter the clo&s;et, and had her lover
been di&s;covered, would in all probability have
been the loude&s;t in his reproach, and perhaps,
have accu&s;ed him of an intention to rob the
hou&s;e: but, &s;he was altogether a&s;toni&s;hed when
&s;he found he had made &s;hift to elude the in|quiry
of her parents, becau&s;e &s;he could not con|ceive
the po&s;&s;ibility of his e&s;caping by the win|dow,
which was in the third &s;tory, at a prodi|gious
di&s;tance from the ground; and how he
could conceal him&s;elf in the apartment, was a
my&s;tery which &s;he could by no means unfold$
Before her father and mother retired, &s;he $ighted
her lamp, on pretence of being afraid to be in
the dark, after the perturbation of &s;pirits &s;he had
undergone, and her room was no &s;ooner eva|cuated
of &s;uch trouble&s;ome vi&s;itants, than &s;he
&s;ecured the doors, and went in que&s;t of her
lover.</P>
<P>Accordingly, every corner of the clo&s;et un|derwent
a new &s;earch, and &s;he called upon his
name with a &s;oft voice, which &s;he thought no
<PB N="76" REF="85">
other per&s;on would overhear: but Ferdinan$
did not think proper to gratify her impatience$
becau&s;e he could not judge of the predicamen$
in which he &s;tood by the evidence of all his
&s;en&s;es, and would not relinqui&s;h his po&s;t, unti$
he &s;hould be better certified that the coa&s;t wa$
clear. Mean while, his Dulcinea having per|formed
her inquiry to no purpo&s;e, imagine$
there was &s;omething preternatural in the circum|&s;tance
of his vani&s;hing &s;o unaccountably, and
began to cro&s;s her&s;elf with great devotion. She
returned to her chamber, fixed the lamp in the
fire-place, and throwing her&s;elf upon the bed$
gave way to the &s;ugge&s;tions of her &s;uper&s;tition&punc;
which were reinforced by the &s;ilence that pre|vailed,
and the gloomy glimmering of the light
She reflected upon the tre&s;pa&s;s &s;he had already
committed in her heart, and in the conjecture
of her fear, believed that her lover was no other
than the devil him&s;elf, who had a&s;&s;umed the ap|pearance
of Fathom, in order to tempt and &s;e|duce
her virtue.</P>
<P>While her imagination teemed with tho&s;$
horrible ideas, our adventurer concluding from
the general &s;tillne&s;s, that the jeweller and his
wife were at la&s;t happily a&s;leep, ventured $word$
come forth from his hiding-place, and &s;tood be|fore
his mi&s;tre&s;s, all begrimed with &s;oot. Wil|helmina
lifting up her eyes, and &s;eeing this &s;a|ble
apparition, which &s;he mi&s;took for Satan i$
propria per&s;ona, in&s;tantly &s;creamed, and bega$
to repeat her Pater-no&s;ter with an audible voice
upon which Ferdinand, fore-&s;eeing that her pa|rents
would be again alarmed, would not &s;tay t$
undeceive her, and explain him&s;elf; but unlock|ing
the door with great expedition, ran down|&s;tairs,
<PB N="77" REF="86">
and luckily accompli&s;hed his e&s;cape. This
was undoubtedly the wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ure he could have
taken: for, he had not performed one half of
his de&s;cent toward the &s;treet, when the Ger|man
was at his daughter's bed-&s;ide, demanding
to know the cau&s;e of her exclamation: &s;he then
gave him an account of what &s;he had &s;een, with
all the exaggerations of her own fancy, and af|ter
having weighed the circum&s;tances of her
&s;tory, he interpreted the apparition into a thief,
who had found means to open the door that
communicated with the &s;tair, but having been
&s;cared by Wilhelmina's &s;hriek, had been ob|liged
to retreat before he could execute his
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Our hero's &s;pirits were &s;o woefully di&s;turbed
by this adventure, that for a whole week he f$lt
no inclination to vi&s;it his inamorata, and was
not without apprehen&s;ion that the affair had ter|minated
in an explanation very little to his ad|vantage.
He was, however, delivered from this
di&s;agreeable &s;u&s;pence, by an accidental meeting
with the jeweller him&s;elf, who kindly chid
him for his long ab&s;ence, and entertained him
in the &s;treet, with an account of the alarm
which his family had &s;u&s;tained, by a thief who
broke into Wilhelmina's apartment. Glad to find
his apprehen&s;ion mi&s;taken, he renewed his cor|re&s;pondence
with the family, and in a little
time, found rea&s;on to con&s;ole him&s;elf for the
jeopardy and panic he had undergone.</P>

<P>NOR was his whole care and attention en|gro&s;&s;ed

how to &s;urmount, &s;he complied with his re|que&s;t,

were &s;ettled accordingly. After this treaty,
their &s;atisfaction ro&s;e to &s;uch a warmth, and the
conver&s;ation became &s;o reciprocally endearing,
that our gallant expre&s;&s;ed his impatience of wait|ing
&s;o long for the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes;
and with the mo&s;t eager tran&s;port, begged &s;he
would, if po&s;&s;ible, curtail the term of his ex|pectation,
that his brain might not &s;uffer by his
&s;tanding &s;o many tedious hours on the giddy
verge of rapture.</P>
<P>The dame, who was naturally compa&s;&s;ionate,
&s;ympathized with his condition, and unable to
re&s;i&s;t his pathetic &s;upplications, gave him to un|der&s;tand
that his de&s;ire could not be granted,
without &s;ubjecting them both to &s;ome hazard,
but that &s;he was di&s;po&s;ed to run any ri&s;que in
behalf of his happine&s;s and peace. After this
affectionate preamble, &s;he told him that her hus|band
was then engaged in a quarterly meeting
of the jewellers, from whence he never &s;ailed
to return quite over-whelmed with wine, to|bacco,
and the phlegm of his own con&s;titution;
&s;o that he would fall fa&s;t a&s;leep as &s;oon as his
head &s;hould touch the pillow; and &s;he be at
liberty to entertain the lover without interrup|tion,
provided he could find means to deceive
the jealous vigilance of Wilhelmina, and conceal
him&s;elf in &s;ome corner of the hou&s;e, un&s;u&s;pected
and unperceived.</P>
<P>Our lover remembring his adventure with the
daughter, would have willingly di&s;pen&s;ed with
this expedient, and began to repent of the eager|ne&s;s
with which he had preferr'd his &s;ollicitation;
but, &s;eeing there was now no opportunity of
retracting with honour, he affected to enter hear|tily
<PB N="80" REF="89">
into the conver&s;ation, and after much can|va&s;&s;ing,
it was determined that while Wilhelmina
was employed in the kitchen, the mother &s;hould
conduct our adventurer to the outward door,
where he &s;hould pay the compliment of parting,
&s;o as to be overheard by the young lady, but in
the mean time, glide &s;oftly into the jeweller's
bed-chamber, which was a place they imagined
lea&s;t liable to the effects of a daughter's prying
di&s;po&s;ition; and conceal him&s;elf in a large pre&s;s
or wardrobe, that &s;tood in one corner of the
apartment. The &s;cene was immediately acted
with great &s;ucce&s;s, and our hero cooped up in
his cage, where he waited &s;o long, that his de|&s;ires
began to &s;ub&s;ide, and his imagination to
aggravate the danger of his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>&startq;Suppo&s;e,&endq; &s;aid he to him&s;elf, &startq;this brutal
German, in&s;tead of being &s;tupified with wine,
&s;hould come home inflamed with brandy, to the
u&s;e of which he is &s;ometimes addicted; far from
feeling any inclination to &s;leep, he will labour
under the mo&s;t fretful anxiety of watching,
every ira&s;cible particle in his di&s;po&s;ition will be
exa&s;perated: he will be offended with every ob|ject
that may pre&s;ent it&s;elf to his view, and if
there is the lea&s;t ingredient of jealou&s;y in his
temper, it will manife&s;t it&s;elf in riot and rage.
What if his frenzy &s;hould prompt him to &s;earch
his wife's chamber for gallants? this would cer|tainly
be the fir&s;t place to which he would direct
his inquiry; or, granting this &s;uppo&s;ition chi|merical,

<P>The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions did not at all contribute to
the quiet of our adventurer, who, having waited
three whole hours in the mo&s;t uncomfortable &s;u&s;|pence,
heard the jeweller brought into the room
in that very condition which his fears had prog|no&s;ticated.
He had, it &s;eems, quarrelled over
his cups with another trade&s;man, and received a
&s;alutation on the forehead with a candle&s;tick,
which, not only left an ignominious and painful
mark upon his countenance, but even di&s;ordered
his brain to a very dangerous degree of delirium:
&s;o that, in&s;tead of allowing him&s;elf quietly to be
undre&s;&s;ed and put to bed by his wife, he an&s;wer|ed
all her gentle admonitions and care&s;&s;es, with
the mo&s;t opprobrious invectives and ob&s;treperous
behaviour; and though he did not tax her with
in&s;idelity to his bed, he virulently accu&s;ed her
of extravagance and want of oeconomy, ob&s;erv|ed
her expen&s;ive way of living would bring him
to a mor&s;el of bread, and unfortunately recol|lecting
the attempt of the &s;uppo&s;ed thief, &s;tart|ed
up from his chair, &s;wearing by God's mother,
that he would forthwith arm him&s;elf with a bra$e
of pi&s;tols, and &s;earch every apartment of the
hou&s;e. &startq;That pre&s;s,&endq; &s;aid he with great voci|feration,
&startq;may for aught I know, be the recep|tacle
of &s;ome ruffian.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he approached the ark in which
Fathom was embarked, and exclaiming &startq;Come
forth, Satan,&endq; applied his foot to the door of it,
with &s;uch violence as threw him from the centre
of gravity, and laid him &s;prawling on his back.
This addre&s;s made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon our
adventurer, that he had well nigh obeyed the
<PB N="82" REF="91">
&s;ummons, and bur&s;t from his concealment, in a
de&s;perate effort to e&s;cape, without being recogniz|ed
by the intoxicated German: and indeed had
the application been repeated, he in all likelihood
would have tried the experiment; for, by this
time, his terrors had waxed too &s;trong to be much
longer &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: from this hazardous enterprize,
he was however exempted by a lucky accident that
happened to his di&s;turber, who&s;e head chancing to
pitch upon the corner of a chair, in his fall, he
was immediately lulled into a trance; during
which, the con&s;iderate lady gue&s;&s;ing the di&s;order
of her gallant, and dreading further interruption,
very prudently relea&s;ed him from his confinement,
after the had put out the light, and in the dark
conveyed him to the door, where he was com|forted
with the promi&s;e that &s;he would punctu|ally
remember the rendezvous of next day.</P>
<P>She then invoked the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ervants,

him&s;elf from any future atchievement of
that &s;ort, in an hou&s;e, where he had been twice

took $requent opportunities of &s;ecreting for his
benefit, certain &s;tray trinkets that &s;he happened
to pick up in her excur&s;ions within doors.</P>
<P>All the&s;e gratifications he received with de|mon&s;trations
of in$inite con&s;traint and reluctance,
and in the mid&s;t of his rapacious extortion, acted
&s;o cunningly as to impo&s;e him&s;elf upon both, for
a miracle of di&s;intere&s;ted integrity. Yet not
contented with what he thus could earn, and
de&s;pairing of being able to &s;teer the bark of his
fortune for any length of time, between two
&s;uch dangerous quick&s;ands, her-e&s;olved to profit
by the occa&s;ion while it la&s;ted, and &s;trike &s;ome
con&s;iderable &s;troke at once. A plan was formed
in con&s;equence of this determination, and at an
appointment with the mother, in the hou&s;e of
their female friend, our adventurer appeared with
an air of dejection, which he veiled with a thin
<PB N="84" REF="93">
cover of forced plea&s;antry, that his mi&s;tre&s;s
might &s;uppo&s;e he endeavoured to conceal &s;ome
mortal chagrin that preyed upon his heart.</P>
<P>The &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h: &s;he ob|&s;erved
his countenance between whiles over-ca&s;t,
took notice of the involuntary &s;ighs he heaved;
and with the mo&s;t tender expre&s;&s;ions of &s;ympathy,
conjured him to make her acquainted with the
cau&s;e of his affliction. In&s;tead of gratifying her
reque&s;t immediately, he evaded her que&s;tions
with a re&s;pectful re&s;erve, implying, that his love
would not &s;uffer him to make her a partner in his
&s;orrow; and this delicacy on his part, whetted her
impatience and concern to &s;uch a degree, that
rather than keep her in &s;uch an agony of doubt and
apprehen&s;ion, he was prevailed upon to tell her,
that he had been the preceding night, engaged
with a company of his fellow-&s;tudents, where
he had made too $ree with the champaigne, &s;o
that his caution for&s;ook him, and he had been
decoyed into a play by a Tyroleze game&s;ter, who
&s;tripped him of all his ready money, and ob|tained
from him, an obligation for two hundred
florins, which he could not po&s;&s;ibly pay, with|out
having recour&s;e to his relation the count de
Melvile, who would have ju&s;t cau&s;e to be incen&s;ed
at his extravagance.</P>
<P>This information he concluded, by declaring,
that co&s;t what it would, he was re&s;olved to make
a candid confe&s;&s;ion of the truth, and throw him|&s;elf
entirely upon the genero&s;ity of his patron,
who could inflict no other puni&s;hment than that
of di&s;carding him from his favour and protection:
a misfortune, which how grievous &s;oever it
might be, he &s;hould be able to &s;u&s;tain with $or|titude,
could he fall upon &s;ome method of &s;atis|fying
<PB N="85" REF="94">
the Tyrole&s;e, who was very importunate
and &s;avage in his demand. His kind mi&s;tre&s;s no
&s;ooner found out the &s;ource of his inquietude,
than &s;he promi&s;ed to dry it up, a&s;&s;uring him that
next day at the &s;ame hour, &s;he would enable him
to di&s;charge the debt; &s;o that he might &s;et his
heart at ea&s;e, and recollect that gaiety which was
the &s;oul of her enjoyment.</P>
<P>He expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment at this
generous proffer, which, however, he declined
with an affected earne&s;tne&s;s of refu&s;al, prote&s;ting
that he &s;hould be extremely mortified, if he
thought &s;he looked upon him as one of tho&s;e
mercenary gallants, who could make &s;uch a for|did
u&s;e of a lady's affection. &startq;No madam,&endq;
cried our politician in a pathetic &s;train, &startq;what|ever
happens, I &s;hall never part with that inter|nal
con&s;olation that con&s;cious honour never
fails to yield in the deepe&s;t &s;cenes of &s;olitary di|&s;tre&s;s:
the attachment I have the honour to pro|fe&s;s
for your amiable per&s;on, is not &s;ounded on
&s;uch inglorious motives; but, is the genuine re|&s;ult
of that generous pa&s;&s;ion, which none but
the noble-minded feel, and the only circum|&s;tance
of this misfortune, that I dread to en|counter,
is, the nece&s;&s;ity of withdrawing my&s;elf
for ever, from the pre&s;ence of her who&s;e genial
&s;miles could animate my &s;oul again&s;t all the per|&s;ecution
of adver&s;e fortune.&endq;</P>
<P>This declamation, accompanied with a pro|&s;ound
&s;igh, &s;erved only to inflame her de&s;ire of
extricating him from the difficulty in which he
was involved. She exhau&s;ted all her eloquence
in attempting to per&s;uade him that his refu&s;al
was an outrage again&s;t her affection: he pre|tended
to re&s;ute her arguments, and remained
<PB N="86" REF="95">
un&s;haken by all the power of her &s;ollicitations$
until &s;he had recour&s;e to the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate re|mon&s;trances
of love, and fell at his feet in the
po&s;ture of a forlorn &s;hepherde&s;s. What he re|fu&s;ed
to her rea&s;on, he granted to her tears, be|cau&s;e
his heart was melted by her affliction, and
next day, conde&s;cended to accept of her money,
out of pure regard to her happine&s;s and peace.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s of this atchieve|ment,
he re&s;olved to practi&s;e the &s;ame experi|ment
upon Wilhelmina, in hope of extracting
an equal &s;hare of profit from her &s;implicity and
attachment; and at their very next nocturnal
rendezvous in her chamber, re-acted the farce
already rehear&s;ed; with a &s;mall variation, which
he thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;timulate the young lady
in his behalf. He rightly concluded, that &s;he
was by no means mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;uch a con&s;iderable
&s;um as he had already extorted from her mother$
and therefore thought proper to repre&s;ent him|&s;elf
in the mo&s;t urgent predicament, that her ap|prehen&s;ion,
on his account, might be &s;o alarmed,
as to engage her in &s;ome enterprize for his ad|vantage,
which, otherwi&s;e, &s;he would never
have dreamed of undertaking. With this view,
after having de&s;cribed his own calamitous &s;itua|tion,
in con&s;equence of her pr$&s;&s;ing intreaties,
which he affected to evade, he gave her to un|der&s;tand
that there was no per&s;on upon earth,
to whom he would have recour&s;e in this emer|gency;
for which rea&s;on, he was determined to
rid him&s;elf of all his cares at once, upon the
friendly point of his own faithful &s;word.</P>
<P>Such a dreadful re&s;olution could not fail to
operate upon the tender pa&s;&s;ions of his Dulcinea$
&s;he was in&s;tantly &s;eized with an agony of $word$
<PB N="87" REF="96">
and di&s;traction: her grief manife&s;ted it&s;elf in a
$lood of tears, while &s;he hung round his neck,
conjuring him in the mo&s;t melting terms, by
their mutual love, in which they had been &s;o
happy, to lay a&s;ide that fatal determination,
which would infallibly involve her in the &s;ame
fate; for, &s;he took Heaven to witne&s;s, that &s;he
would not one moment &s;urvive the knowledge
of his death.</P>
<P>He was not deficient in expre&s;&s;ions of reci|procal
regard: he extolled her love and tender|ne&s;s
with a mo&s;t extravagant eulogium; and
&s;eemed wrung with mortal angui&s;h at the pro&s;|pect
of parting for ever from his lovely Wil|helmina;
but his honour was a &s;tern and rigid
creditor, that could not be appea&s;ed, except with
his blood; and all the boon &s;he could obtain, by
dint of the mo&s;t woeful &s;upplication, was a pro|mi&s;e
to defer the execution of his baleful purpo&s;e,
for the &s;pace of four and twenty hours, during
which, &s;he hoped, Heaven would compa&s;&s;ionate
her &s;ufferings, and in&s;pire her with &s;ome contri|vance
for their mutual relief. Thus he yielded
to her fervent reque&s;t, rather with a view to
calm the pre&s;ent tran&s;ports of her &s;orrow, than
with any expectation of &s;eeing him&s;elf redeemed
from his fate, by her interpo&s;ition; &s;uch at lea&s;t
were his profe&s;&s;ions, when he took his leave,
a&s;&s;uring her, that he would not quit his being,
before he &s;hould have devoted a few hours to
another interview with the dear object of his
love.</P>
<P>Having th$ kindled the train, he did not
doubt that the mine of his craft would take ef|fect,
and repaired to his own lodging, in full
per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;eeing his aim accompli&s;hed, before
<PB N="88" REF="97">
the time fixed for their la&s;t a&s;&s;ignation. His
progno&s;tic was next morning verified by the arri|val
of a me&s;&s;enger, who brought to him a &s;mall
parcel, to which was cemented with &s;ealing|wax,
the following epi&s;tle.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>&startq;Jewel of my &s;oul!</OPENER>
<P>Scarce had you, la&s;t night, quitted my di&s;|con&s;olate
arms, when I happily recollected
that there was in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a gold chain,
of value more than &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the
exigence of your pre&s;ent occa&s;ions: it was
pledged to my grandfather for two hundred
crowns, by a knight of Malta, who &s;oon af|ter
peri&s;hed in a &s;ea-engagement with the
enemies of our faith; &s;o that it became the
property of our hou&s;e, and was bequeathed
to me by the old gentleman, as a memorial
of his particular affection. Upon whom can
I more properly be&s;tow it, than him who is
already ma&s;ter of my heart! receive it, there|fore,
from the bearer of this billet, and con|vert
it without &s;cruple to that u&s;e which
&s;hall be mo&s;t conducive to your ea&s;e and &s;a|tisfaction;
nor &s;eek, from a too romantic
notion of honour, which I know you enter|tain,
to excu&s;e your&s;elf, from accepting this
te&s;timony of my affection: for, I have al|ready
&s;worn before an image of our ble&s;&s;ed
lady, that I will no longer own you as the
&s;overeign of my heart, nor even indulge you
with another interview, if you reject this
mark of tenderne&s;s and concern, from your
ever faithful.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>WILHELMINA.&endq;</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="89" REF="98">
The heart of our adventurer began to bound
with joy, when he &s;urveyed the contents of this
letter; and his eyes &s;parkled with tran&s;port at
&s;ight of the chain, which he immediately per|ceived
to be worth twice the &s;um &s;he had men|tioned.
Neverthele&s;s, he would not avail him|&s;elf
without further que&s;tion of her genero&s;ity;
but, that &s;ame night, repairing to her apartment
at the u&s;ual hour of meeting, he pro&s;trated him|&s;elf
before her, and counterfeiting extreme agi|tation
of &s;pirit, begged in the mo&s;t urgent terms,
not even unaccompanied with tears, that &s;he
would take back the pre&s;ent which he tendered
for her acceptance; and &s;pare him the mo&s;t in|&s;ufferable
mortification of thinking him&s;elf ex|po&s;ed
to the imputation of being mercenary in
his love. Such, he &s;aid, was the delicacy of
his pa&s;&s;ion, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t under
the apprehen&s;ion of incurring a cen&s;ure &s;o un|worthy
of his &s;entiments; and he would a thou|&s;and
times, &s;ooner undergo the per&s;ecution of
his rancorous creditor, than bear the thought
of being in the &s;malle&s;t con&s;ideration le&s;&s;ened
in her e&s;teem: nay, &s;o far did he carry his pre|ten&s;ions
to punctilio, as to prote&s;t that &s;hould
&s;he refu&s;e to quiet the &s;cruples of his honour,
on this &s;core, her unyielding beneficence would
&s;erve only to ha&s;ten the execution of his deter|mined
purpo&s;e, to withdraw him&s;elf at once
from a life of vanity and misfortune.</P>
<P>The more pathetically he pleaded for her com|pliance,
the more &s;trenuou&s;ly did &s;he re&s;i&s;t his
remon&s;trances. She advanced all the arguments
her rea&s;on, love and terror could &s;ugge&s;t, re|minded
him of her oath, from which, he could
not &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would recede, whatever the con|&s;equence
<PB N="90" REF="99">
might be; and in conclu&s;ion, vowe$
to Heaven with great &s;olemnity and devotion,
that &s;he would not &s;urvive the news of his death.
Thus the alternative &s;he offered, was either to
retain the chain and be happy in her affection,
or forfeit all title to her love, and die in the con|viction
of having brought his innocent mi&s;tre$$
to an untimely grave.</P>
<P>His fortitude was not proof again&s;t this la&s;t
con&s;ideration: &startq;My &s;avage honour,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;would enable me to endure the pangs of eter|nal
&s;eparation, in the confidence of being endowed
with the power of ending the&s;e tortures by the
energy of my own hand; but, the pro&s;pect o$
Wilhelmina's death, and that too occa&s;ioned by
my inflexibility, di&s;arms my &s;oul of all her re|&s;olution,
&s;wallows up the dictates of my jealo$$
pride, and fills my bo&s;om with &s;uch a gu&s;h o$
tenderne&s;s and &s;orrow, as overwhelms the whole
oeconomy of my purpo&s;e! Yes, inchanting crea|ture!
I &s;acrifice my glory to that irre&s;i&s;tible re|flection:
and rather than know my&s;elf the cru$$
in&s;trument of robbing the world of &s;uch perfec|tion,
con&s;ent to retain the fatal te&s;timony $word$
your love.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he pocketed the chain, with an
air of ineffable mortification, and was rewarded
for his compliance with the mo&s;t endearing c$|re&s;&s;es
of his Dulcinea, who amid&s;t the tumul$
of his joy, ejaculated a thou&s;and acknowledg|ments
to Heaven, for having ble&s;&s;ed her with
the affection of &s;uch a man, who&s;e honour was
unrivalled by any thing but his love.</P>

<P>IN this manner did the crafty Fathom turn to
account tho&s;e ingratiating qualifications he
inherited from nature; and maintain with in|credible
a&s;&s;iduity and circum&s;pection, an amorous
corre&s;pondence with two dome&s;tic rivals, who
watched the conduct of each other, with the
mo&s;t indefatigable virulence of envious &s;u&s;picion,
until an accident happened, which had well-nigh
overturned the bark of his policy, and induced
him to alter the cour&s;e, that he might not be
&s;hipwrecked on the rocks that began to multiply
in the pro&s;ecution of his pre&s;ent voyage.</P>
<P>The jeweller, who, as a German, wanted
neither pride nor o&s;tentation, never failed to cele|brate
the anniver&s;ary of his birth, by an annual
fea&s;t granted to his neighbours and friends; and
on the&s;e occa&s;ions, was accu&s;tomed to wear that
chain, which though bequeathed to his daughter,
he con&s;idered as an ornament appertaining to
the family, whereof he him&s;elf was head: ac|cordingly,
when the time of this fe&s;tival revolved,
he as u&s;ual, ordered Wilhelmina to &s;urrender it
for the day. This injunction, the reader will
perceive, our young lady was in no condition to
obey; &s;he had, however, fore&s;een the demand,
and contrived a &s;cheme of behaviour, for the
occa&s;ion, which &s;he forthwith put in execu|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="101">
With an air of uncommon chearfulne&s;s pur|po&s;ely
a&s;&s;umed, &s;he retired to her clo&s;et, on pre|tence
of complying with his de&s;ire, and having
employed a few minutes in rummaging her
drawers, and di&s;ordering her moveables, uttered
a loud &s;hriek, that brought her father in&s;tantly
into the apartment, where he found his daughter
to&s;&s;ing about her cloaths and trinkets, with vio|lent
demon&s;trations of di&s;order and affright, and
heard her in a lamentable &s;train declare, that &s;he
was robbed of her chain, and for ever undone.
This was &s;o far from being an agreeable intima|tion
to the jeweller, that he was &s;truck dumb
with a&s;toni&s;hment and vexation, and it was not
till after a long pau&s;e, that he pronounced the
word Sacrament! with an empha&s;is, denoting
the mo&s;t mortifying &s;urprize.</P>
<P>Soon as that exclamation e&s;caped from his
lips, he flew to the &s;crutore as if in&s;tinctively, and
joining Wilhelmina in her occupation, tumbled
its whole contents upon the floor, in a trice.</P>
<P>While he was thus employed, in the mo&s;t
expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence, the wife of his bo&s;om chanced
to pa&s;s that way, and &s;eeing them both occu|pied,
with &s;uch violence and trepidation, believed
at fir&s;t, that they were certainly actuated by the
&s;pirit of frenzy; but when &s;he interpo&s;ed, by
a&s;king with great earne&s;tne&s;s, the cau&s;e of &s;uch
tran&s;ports and di&s;tracted behaviour; and heard
her hu&s;band reply with an accent of de&s;pair,
&startq;The chain! the chain of my forefathers is no
more.&endq; She immediately ju&s;tified his emotion,
by undergoing the &s;ame alarm, and without fur|ther
he&s;itation, engaged her&s;elf in the &s;earch,
beginning with a &s;ong, which might be compar|ed
to the hymn of battle among the Greeks, or
<PB N="93" REF="102">
rather more aptly, to that which the Spartan
females &s;ung round the altar of Diana, &s;urnamed
Orthian: for, it was attended with &s;trange ge&s;ti|culations,
and in the cour&s;e of utterance, be|came
&s;o loud and &s;hrill, that the gue&s;ts, who
were by this time partly a&s;&s;embled, being con|founded
at the clamour, ru&s;hed towards the
place from whence it &s;eemed to proceed, and
found their landlord, with his wife and daughter
in the attitudes of di&s;traction and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>When they under&s;tood the nature of the ca&s;e,
they condoled the family on their misfortune,
and would have retired, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that
it would defeat the mirthful intent of their
meeting; but the jeweller mu&s;tering up his
whole temper and ho&s;pitality, intreated them to
excu&s;e his di&s;order, and favour him with their
company, which, he ob&s;erved, was now more than
ever wanted, to di&s;pel the melancholy ideas in|&s;pired
by his lo&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding this apology,
and the efforts he made in the &s;equel, to enter|tain
his friends with jollity and good humour,
his heart was &s;o linked to the chain, that he
could not detach him&s;elf from the thoughts of
it, which invaded him at &s;hort intervals, in &s;uch
qualms as effectually &s;poiled his appetite and hin|dered
his dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>He revolved within him&s;elf, the circum&s;tances
of his di&s;a&s;ter, and in canva&s;&s;ing all the probable
means, by which the chain could be &s;tolen, con|cluded
that the deed mu&s;t have been done by
&s;ome per&s;on in the family, who, in con&s;equence
of having acce&s;s to his daughter's chamber, had
either found the drawer left open by her care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s
and neglect, or found means to obtain a
fal&s;e key, by &s;ome waxen impre&s;&s;ion: for, the
<PB N="94" REF="103">
locks of the e&s;critore were &s;afe and uninjured.
His &s;u&s;picion being thus confined within his own
hou&s;e, &s;ometimes pitched upon his workmen,
and &s;ometimes upon his wife, who, he thought,
was the more likely to practi&s;e &s;uch fine&s;le, as
&s;he con&s;idered Wilhelmina in the light of a
daughter in-law, who&s;e intere&s;t interfered with
her own, and who had often harangued to him in
private, on the folly of leaving this very chain
in the young lady's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The more he con&s;idered this &s;ubject, he
thought he &s;aw the more rea&s;on to attribute the
damage he had &s;u&s;tained, to the machinations
of his &s;pou&s;e, who, he did not doubt, was
di&s;po&s;ed to feather her own ne&s;t, at the expence
of him and his heirs, and who, with the &s;ame
hone&s;t intention had already &s;ecreted for her pri|vate
u&s;e, tho&s;e incon&s;iderable jewels which of
late had at different times, been mi&s;&s;ing. Ar|rou&s;ed
by the&s;e &s;entiments, he re&s;olved to re|taliate
her own &s;chemes, by contriving means
to vi&s;it her cabinet in &s;ecret, and if po&s;&s;ible, to
rob the robber, of the &s;poils &s;he had gathered to
his prejudice, without coming to any explanation,
which might end in dome&s;tic turmoils and eter|nal
di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>While the hu&s;band exerci&s;ed his reflection in
this manner, his innocent mate did not allow
the powers of her imagination to re&s;t in idlene&s;s
and &s;loth. Her ob&s;ervations touching the lo&s;s of
the chain were &s;uch, as a &s;u&s;picious woman,
bia&s;&s;ed by hatred and envy, would naturally
make. To her it &s;eemed highly improbable,
that a thing of &s;uch value, &s;o carefully depo&s;ited,
&s;hould vani&s;h without the connivance of its
keeper, and without much expence of conjec|ture,
<PB N="95" REF="104">
divined the true manner in which it was
conveyed. The &s;ole difficulty that occurred in
the re&s;earches of her &s;agacity, was to know the
gallant, who had been favoured with &s;uch a
pledge of Wilhelmina's affection; for as the
reader will ea&s;ily imagine, &s;he never dreamed of
viewing Ferdinand in that odious per&s;pective.
In order to &s;atisfy her curio&s;ity, di&s;cover this
happy favourite, and be revenged on her petulant
rival, &s;he prevailed upon the jeweller to employ
a &s;cout, who &s;hould watch all night upon the
&s;tair, without the knowledge of any other per|&s;on
in the family, alledging, that in all likeli|hood,
the hou&s;e-maid gave private admittance
to &s;ome lover, who was the author of all the
lo&s;&s;es they had lately &s;uffered, and that they
might po&s;&s;ibly detect him in his nocturnal ad|ventures;
and ob&s;erving that it would be impru|dent
to intimate their de&s;ign to Wilhelmina,
left through the heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s and indi&s;cretion of
youth, &s;he might chance to divulge the &s;ecret,
&s;o as to fru&s;trate their aim.</P>
<P>A Swi&s;s, in who&s;e hone&s;ty the German could
confide, being hired for this purpo&s;e, was po&s;ted
in a dark corner of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, within a few
paces of the door, which he was directed to
watch, and actually &s;tood centinel three nights,
without perceiving the lea&s;t object of &s;u&s;picion;
but on the fourth, the evil &s;tars of our adven|turer
conducted him to the &s;pot, on his voyage
to the apartment of his Dulcinea, with whom
he had had pre-concerted the a&s;&s;ignation. Having
made the &s;ignal, which con&s;i&s;ted of two gentle
taps on her door, he was immediately admitted,
and the Swi&s;s, no &s;ooner &s;aw him fairly hou&s;ed,
than he crept &s;oftly to the other door, that was
<PB N="96" REF="105">
left open for the purpo&s;e, and gave immediate inti|mation
of what he had perceived: this intelli|gence,
however, he could not convey &s;o &s;ecretly
but the lovers, who were always vigilant upon
the&s;e occa&s;ions, overheard a &s;ort of commotion
in the jeweller's chamber, the cau&s;e of which
their apprehen&s;ion was ingenious enough to com|prehend.</P>
<P>We have formerly ob&s;erved, that our adven|turer
could not make his retreat by the door
without running a very great ri&s;que of being de|tected,
and the expedient of the chimney h$
had no inclination to repeat; &s;o that he found
him&s;elf in a very uncomfortable dilemma, and
was utterly abandoned by all his invention an
addre&s;s; when his mi&s;tre&s;s in a whi&s;per, de&s;ire
him to begin a dialogue, aloud, in an apology
importing, that he had mi&s;taken the door; and
that his intention was to vi&s;it her father, touch|ing
a ring belonging to the young count Me|vile,
which, &s;he knew, Fathom had put into
his hands, in order to be altered.</P>
<P>Ferdinand &s;eizing the hint, availed him&s;elf $word$
it, without delay, and unbolting the door, pro|nounced
in an audible voice, &startq;Upon my ho|nour,
Mademoi&s;elle, you wrong my intention
if you imagine I came hither with any di&s;re&s;pect|ful
or di&s;honourable motive: I have bu&s;ine&s;s with
your father, which cannot be delayed till to-mor|row,
without manife&s;t prejudice to my friend
and my&s;elf; therefore I took the liberty of vi&s;u|ing
him at the&s;e untimely hours; and it has been
my misfortune to mi&s;take the door in the dark
I beg pardon for my involuntary intru&s;ion; and
again a&s;&s;ure you, that nothing was farther from
my thoughts, than any de&s;ign to violate the
<PB N="97" REF="106">
re&s;pect, which I have always entertained for you
and your father's family.&endq;</P>
<P>To this remon&s;trance, which was di&s;tinctly
heard by the German and his wife, who by this
time, &s;tood li&s;tening at the door, the young
lady replied in a &s;hrill accent of di&s;plea&s;ure,
&startq;Sir, I am bound to believe that all your ac|tions
are conducted by honour; but, you mu&s;t
give me leave to tell you, that your mi&s;take is a
little extraordinary, and your vi&s;it even to my
father at this time of the night, altogether un|&s;ea&s;onable,
if not my&s;terious. As for the inter|ruption
I have &s;uffered in my repo&s;e, I impute
it to my own forgetfulne&s;s, in leaving my door
unlocked, and blame my&s;elf &s;o &s;everely for the
omi&s;&s;ion that I &s;hall tomorrow put it out of my
own power to be guilty of the like for the future,
by ordering the pa&s;&s;age to be nailed up; mean
while, if you would per&s;uade me of your well|meaning,
you will in&s;tantly withdraw, left my
reputation &s;hould &s;uffer by your continuance in
my apartment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Madam, an&s;wered our hero, I will not
give you an opportunity to repeat the command,
which I &s;hall forthwith obey, after having in|treated
you once more, to forgive the di&s;tur|bance
I have given.&endq; So &s;aying, he gently opened
the door, and at &s;ight of the German and his
wife, who, he well knew, waited for his exit,
&s;tarted back, and gave tokens of confu&s;ion which
was partly real and partly affected. The jewel|ler
fully &s;atisfied with Fathom's declaration to
his daughter, received him with a complai|&s;ant
look, and in order to alleviate his con|cern,
gave him to under&s;tand that he already
knew the rea&s;on of his being in that apartment,
<PB N="98" REF="107">
and de&s;ired to be informed of what had pro|cured
him the honour to &s;ee him at &s;uch a junc|ture.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear friend, &s;aid our adventurer, pre|tending
to recollect him&s;elf with difficulty. I
am utterly a&s;hamed and confounded to be di&s;|covered
in this &s;ituation; but as you have over|heard
what pa&s;t between Mademoi&s;elle and me,
I know you will do ju&s;tice to my intention and
forgive my mi&s;take. After begging pardon for
having intruded upon your family at the&s;e hours,
I mu&s;t now tell you, that my cou&s;in count Mel|vile
was &s;om$ time ago &s;o much mi&s;repre&s;ented
to his mother, by certain malicious informers,
who delight in &s;owing di&s;cord in private families,
that &s;he actually believed her &s;on an extrava|gant
&s;pendthri&s;t, who had not only con&s;umed
his remittances in the mo&s;t riotous &s;cenes of di&s;|order,
but al&s;o indulged a pernicious appetite
for gaming to &s;uch a degree, that he had lo&s;t
all his cloaths and jewels at play. In con&s;e|quence
of &s;uch fal&s;e information, &s;he expo&s;tu|lated
with him in a &s;evere letter, and de&s;ired he
would tran&s;mit to her that ring which is in
your cu&s;tody, it being a family &s;tone, for which
&s;he expre&s;&s;ed an ine&s;timable value. The young
gentleman, in his an&s;wer to her reproof, endea|voured
to vindicate him&s;elf from the a&s;per&s;ions
which had been ca&s;t upon his character, and
with regard to the ring, told her it was at pre|&s;ent
in the hands of a jeweller, in order to be
new &s;et, according to her own directions, and
that whenever it &s;hould be altered, he would
&s;end it home to her by &s;ome &s;afe conveyance.
This account the good lady took for an eva&s;ion,
and upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, has again written to
<PB N="99" REF="108">
him, in &s;uch a provoking &s;tile, that although
the letter arrived but half an hour ago, he is de|termined
to di&s;patch a courier before morning
with the mi&s;chievous ring, for which, in compli|ance
with the impetuo&s;ity of his temper, I have
taken the freedom to di&s;turb you at this un&s;ea|&s;onable
hour.</P>
<P>The German paid implicit faith to every cir|cum&s;tance
of this &s;tory, which indeed could not
well be &s;uppo&s;ed to be invented extempore; the
ring was immediately re&s;tored, and our adven|turer
took his leave, congratulating him&s;elf up|on
his &s;ignal deliverance from the &s;nare in which
he had fallen.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The &s;tep-dame's &s;u&s;picions being awakened, &s;he lays
a &s;nare for our adventurer, from which he is
delivered by the interpo&s;ition of his good genius.</HEAD>
<P>THough the hu&s;band &s;wallowed the bait,
without further inquiry, the penetration
of the wi&s;e was not &s;o ea&s;ily deceived: that
&s;ame dialogue in Wilhelmina's apartment, far
from allaying, rather inflamed her &s;u&s;picion, be|cau&s;e
in the like emergency, &s;he her&s;elf had
once profited by the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame
contrivance. Without communicating her doubts
to the father, &s;he re&s;olved to double her atten|tion
to the daughter's future conduct, and keep
&s;uch a &s;trict eye over the behaviour of our gal|lant,
that he &s;hould find it very difficult, if not
impo&s;&s;ible, to elude her ob&s;ervation. For this
purpo&s;e, &s;he took into her pay an old maiden,
of the right &s;our di&s;po&s;ition, who lived in an
<PB N="100" REF="109">
hou&s;e oppo&s;ite to her own, and directed her to
follow the young lady in all her out-goings,
whenever &s;he &s;hould receive from the window a
certain &s;ignal, which the mother-in-law agreed
to make for the occa&s;ion. It was not long before
this &s;cheme &s;ucceeded to her wi&s;h: the door of
communication, betwixt Wilhelmina's apartment
and the &s;tair ca&s;e, being nailed up, by the jewel|ler's
expre&s;s order, our adventurer was altogether
deprived of tho&s;e opportunities he had hitherto
enjoyed; and was not at all mortified to find
him&s;elf &s;o re&s;tricted, in a corre&s;pondence which
began to be tire&s;ome and di&s;agreeable: but the
ca&s;e was far otherwi&s;e with his Deleinea, who&s;e
pa&s;&s;ion, the more it was thwarted, raged with
greater violence, like a fire, that from the at|tempts
that are made to extingui&s;h it, gathers
greater force, and flames with double fury.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;econd day of her misfortune, &s;he
had written a very tender billet, lamenting her
unhappine&s;s, in being deprived of tho&s;e meetings
which con&s;tituted the chief joy of her life, and
intreating him to contrive &s;ome means of re|newing
the delicious commerce in an un&s;u&s;pect|ed
place. This intimation &s;he propo&s;ed to
convey privately into the hand of her lover, dur|ing
his next vi&s;it to the family; but both were
&s;o narrowly eyed by the mother, that &s;he found
the execution of her de&s;ign impracticable; and
next forenoon, on pretence of going to church,
repaired to the hou&s;e of a companion, who be|ing
al&s;o her confidante, undertook to deliver the
billet with her own hand.</P>
<P>The &s;he-dragon employed by her mother, in
obedience to the &s;ign, which was di&s;played from
the window, immediately put on her veil, and
<PB N="101" REF="110">
followed Wilhelmina at a di&s;tance, until &s;he
&s;aw her fairly hou&s;ed: &s;he would not even then,
return from her excur&s;ion, but hovered about in
&s;ight of the door, with a view of making further
ob&s;ervations: in le&s;s than five minutes after
the young lady di&s;appeared, the &s;cout perceived
her coming out, accompanied by her comrade,
from whom &s;he in&s;tantly parted, and bent her
way towards the church in good earne&s;t, while
the other &s;teered her cour&s;e in another direction.
The duenna, after a moment's &s;u&s;pence and con|&s;ideration,
divined the true cau&s;e of this &s;hort
vi&s;it, and re&s;olved to watch the motions of the
confidante, whom &s;he traced to the academy in
which our hero lodged, and from which &s;he
&s;aw her return, after the &s;uppo&s;ed me&s;&s;age was
delivered.</P>
<P>Fraught with this intelligence, the rancorous
under&s;trapper, hied her home to the jeweller's
wife, and made a faithful recital of what &s;he had
&s;een; communicating, at the &s;ame time, her own
conjectures on the &s;ubject. Her employer was
equally a&s;toni&s;hed and incen&s;ed at this informa|tion:
&s;he was &s;eized with all that frenzy which
takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;lighted woman, when &s;he
finds her&s;elf &s;upplanted by a dete&s;ted rival; and
in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of her indignation, devoted
them as &s;acrifices to her vengeance: nor was
her &s;urprize &s;o much the effect of his diffi nulation,
as of his want of ta&s;te and di&s;cernment. She in|veighed
again&s;t him, not as the mo&s;t treache|rous
lover, but as the mo&s;t abject wretch, in
courting the &s;miles of &s;uch an aukward dowdy,
while he enjoyed the favours of a woman, who
had numbered princes in the train of her admi|rers.
For the brilliancy of her attractions, &s;uch
<PB N="102" REF="111">
as they at pre&s;ent &s;hone, &s;he appealed to the
deci&s;ion of her mini&s;ter, who con&s;ulted her own
&s;atisfaction and intere&s;t, by flattering the others
vanity and re&s;entment: and &s;o unaccountable
did the depravity of our hero's judgment appear
to this conceited dame, that &s;he began to believe
there was &s;ome mi&s;take in the per&s;on, and to
hope that Wilhelmina's gallant was not in reality
her profe&s;&s;ed admirer Mr. Fathom, but rather
one of his fellow lodgers, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion he fa|voured
with his mediation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>On this notion, which nothing but meer va|nity
could have in&s;pired, in oppo&s;ition to &s;o
many more weighty pre&s;umptions, &s;he took the
re&s;olution of bringing the affair to a fuller ex|planation,
before &s;he would concert any mea|&s;ures
to the prejudice of our adventurer, and
forthwith di&s;patched her &s;py back to his lodgings
to &s;ollicit on the part of Wilhelmina an immedi|ate
an&s;wer to the letter he had received. This was
an expedition with which the old maiden would
have willingly di&s;pen&s;ed, becau&s;e it was founded
upon an uncertainty, which might be attended
with trouble&s;ome con&s;equences; but rather then
be the means of retarding a negociation, &s;o pro|ductive
of that &s;ort of mi&s;chief which is parti|cularly
agreeable to all of her tribe, &s;he un|dertook
to manage and effect the di&s;covery, in
full confidence of her own talents and expe|rience.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a fund of &s;elf &s;ufficiency and in&s;ti|gation,
&s;he repaired to the academy on the in|&s;tant,
and inquiring for Mr. Fathom, was in|troduced
to his apartment, where &s;he found him
in the very act of writing a billet to the jewel|ler's
daughter. The artful agent having a&s;ked,
<PB N="103" REF="112">
with the my&s;terious air of an expert go between,
if he had not lately received a me&s;&s;age from a
certain young lady; and being an&s;wered in the
affirmative, gave him to under&s;tand, that &s;he her|&s;elf
was a per&s;on favoured with the friend&s;hip
and confidence of Withelmina, whom &s;he had
known from her cradle, and often dandled on
her knee; then in the genuine &s;tile of a prat|ling
dry-nur&s;e, &s;he launched out in encomiums
on his Dulcinca's beauty and &s;weetne&s;s of tem|per,
recounting many &s;imple occurrences of her
infancy and childhood; and finally, de&s;iring a
more circum&s;tantial an&s;wer to that which &s;he
had &s;ent to him by her friend Catherina. In
the cour&s;e of her loquacity, &s;he had al&s;o, accord|ing
to her in&s;tructions, hinted at the misfortune
of the door; and on the whole, performed her
cue with &s;uch dexte$ity and di&s;cretion, that our
politician was actually over-reached, and having
fini&s;hed his epi&s;tle, committed it to her care,
with many verbal expre&s;&s;ions of eternal love and
fidelity to his charming Wilhelmina.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger doubly rejoiced at her atchieve|ment,
which not only recommended her mi|ni&s;try,
but al&s;o gratified her malice, returned to
her principal with great exultation, and deliver|ing
the letter, the reader will ea&s;ily conceive
the tran&s;ports of that lady, when &s;he read the
contents of it in the&s;e words.</P>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>FATHOM.&endq;</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Had our hero murdered her father, or left her
a di&s;con&s;olate widow, by effecting the death of
her dear hu&s;band, there might have been a po&s;|&s;ibility
of her exerting the chri&s;tian virtues of
re&s;ignation and &s;orgivene&s;s; but &s;uch a per&s;onal
outrage as that contained in this epi&s;tle, preclud|ed
all hope of pardon, and rendered penitence
of no &s;ignification. His atrocious crime being
now fully a&s;certained, this virago gave a loo&s;e
to her re&s;entment, which became &s;o loud and
tempe&s;tuous, that her informer &s;huddered at
the &s;torm &s;he had rai&s;ed, and began to repent
of having communicated the intelligence which
&s;eemed to have &s;uch a violent effect upon her
brain.</P>
<P>She endeavoured, however, to allay the agi|tation,
by flattering her fancy with the pro&s;pect
<PB N="105" REF="114">
of revenge, and gradually &s;oothed her into a
&s;tate of deliberate ire; during which &s;he deter|mined
to take ample vengeance on the delinquent.
In the zenith of her rage, &s;he would have had
immediate recour&s;e to poi&s;on or &s;teel, had &s;he not
been diverted from her mortal purpo&s;e, by her
coun&s;ellor, who repre&s;ented the danger of engag|ing
in &s;uch violent mea&s;ures, and propo&s;ed a
more &s;ecure &s;cheme, in the execution of which
&s;he would &s;ee the per&s;idious wretch &s;ufficiently
puni&s;hed, without any hazard to her own per&s;on
or reputation. She advi&s;ed her to inform the
jeweller of Fathom's efforts, to &s;educe her con|jugal
fidelity, and impart to him a plan, by
which he would have it in his power, to detect
our adventurer in the very act of practi&s;ing upon
her virtue.</P>
<P>The lady reli&s;hed her propo&s;al, and actually
re&s;olved to make an a&s;&s;ignation with Ferdinand,
as u&s;ual, and give notice of the appointment
to her hu&s;band, that he might per&s;onally di&s;cover
the treachery of his pretended friend, and inflict
upon him &s;uch cha&s;ti&s;ement, as the German's
brutal di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t, when inflamed
by that &s;pecies of provocation. Had this project
been brought to bear, Ferdinand in all likelihood,
would have been di&s;qualified from engaging in
any future intrigue; but fate ordained, that the
de&s;ign &s;hould be defeated, in order to re&s;erve him
for more important occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Before the circum&s;tances of the plan could
be adju&s;ted, it was his good fortune to meet his
Dulcinea in the &s;treet, and in the mid&s;t of their
mutual condolance on the interruption they had
&s;uffered in their corre&s;pondence, he a&s;&s;ured her,
that he would never give his invention re&s;pite,
<PB N="106" REF="115">
until he &s;hould have verified the prote&s;tations
contained in the letter he had delivered to her
di&s;creet agent. This allu&s;ion to a billet &s;he have
never received, did not fail to alarm her fears,
and introduce a very mortifying explanation, in
which he &s;o accurately de&s;cribed the per&s;on of
the me&s;&s;enger, that &s;he forthwith comprehended
the plot, and communicated to our hero her &s;en|timents
on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Though he expre&s;&s;ed infinite anxiety and cha|grin
at this misfortune, which could not fail to
rai&s;e new ob&s;tacles to their love, his heart was a
&s;tranger to the unea&s;ine&s;s he affected; and ra|ther
plea&s;ed with the occa&s;ion, which would
furni&s;h him with pretences to withdraw him&s;elf
gradually, from an intercour&s;e by this time be|come
equally cloying and unprofitable. Being
well acquainted with the mother's temperament,
he gue&s;&s;ed the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of her thoughts,
and concluding &s;he would make the jeweller a
party in her revenge, he re&s;olved from that mo|ment
to di&s;continue his vi&s;its, and cautiou&s;ly
guard again&s;t any future interview with the lady,
whom he had rendered &s;o implecable.</P>
<P>It was well for our adventurer that his good
fortune &s;o &s;ea&s;onably interpo&s;ed; for that &s;ame
day, in the afternoon, he was favoured with a
billet from the jeweller's wife, couched in the
&s;ame tender &s;tile &s;he had formerly u&s;ed, and im|porting
an earne&s;t de&s;ire of &s;eeing him next day,
at the wonted rendezvous. Although his pene|tration
was &s;ufficient to perceive the drift of this
me&s;&s;age; or at lea&s;t, to di&s;cern the ri&s;que he
&s;hould run, in complying with her reque&s;t, yet
he was willing to be more fully certified of the
truth of his &s;u&s;picion, and wrote an an&s;wer to
<PB N="107" REF="116">
the billet, in which he a&s;&s;ured her, that he would
repair to the place of appointment, with all the
punctuality of an impatient lover. Neverthele&s;s,
in&s;tead of performing this promi&s;e, he, in the
morning, took po&s;t in a public hou&s;e oppo&s;ite
to the place of a&s;&s;ignation, in order to recon|noitre
the ground, and about noon had the plea|&s;ure
of &s;eeing the German wrapped in a cloak,
enter the door of his wife's &s;he-friend, though
the appointment was fixed at five in the evening.
Fathom ble&s;&s;ed his good angel, for having con|ducted
him clear of this con&s;piracy, and kept
his &s;tation with great tranquility, till the hour
of meeting, when he beheld his enraged Tha|le&s;tris
take the &s;ame route, and enjoyed her di&s;|appointment
with ineffable &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Thus favoured with a pretext, he took his
leave of her, in a letter, giving her to under&s;tand,
that he was no &s;tranger to the barbarous &s;nare
&s;he had laid for him; and upbraiding her with
having made &s;uch an ungrateful return for all
his tenderne&s;s and attachment. She was not
backward in conveying a reply to this expe&s;tu|lation,
which &s;eemed to have been dictated in
all the di&s;traction of a proud woman who &s;ees
her vengeance baffled, as well as her love di&s;|dained.
Her letter was nothing but a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of reproaches, menaces, and incoherent execra|tions.
She taxed him with knavery, in&s;en&s;ibility
and di&s;&s;imulation; imprecated a thou&s;and cur&s;es
upon his head, and threatned not only to per&s;e|cute
his life with all the arts that hell and ma|lice
could in&s;pire, but al&s;o to wound him in the

inclo&s;ed for life in a convent, where &s;he would
have lei&s;ure to repent of tho&s;e loo&s;e and di&s;er|derly
<PB N="108" REF="117">
practices, which he had taught her to
commit, and of which &s;he could not pretend in|nocence,
as they had it in their power to con|front
her with the evidence of her lover's own
confe&s;&s;ion. Yet all this denunciation was quali|fied
with an alternative, by which he was given
to under&s;tand, that the gates of mercy were &s;till
open, and that penitence was capable of wa&s;h|ing
out the deepe&s;t &s;tain of guilt.</P>
<P>Ferdinand read the whole remon&s;trance with
great compo&s;ure and moderation, and was con|tent
to incur the hazard of her hate, rather
than put her to the trouble of making &s;uch an
effort of genero&s;ity, as would induce her to for|give
the heinous offence he had committed; nor
did his apprehen&s;ion for Wilhelmina in the lea&s;t
influence his behaviour on this occa&s;ion: &s;o
zealous was he for her &s;piritual concerns, that
he would have been glad to hear &s;he had actu|ally
taken the veil; but he knew &s;uch a &s;tep
was not at all agreeable to her di&s;po&s;ition, and
that no violence would be offered to her inclina|tions
on that &s;core, unle&s;s her &s;tep-mother &s;hould
communicate to the father that letter of Fa|thom
which &s;he had intercepted, and by which
the German would be convinced of his daughter's
back&s;liding; but this mea&s;ure, he rightly &s;up|po'ed,
the wife would not venture to take, le&s;t
the husband, in&s;tead of taking her advice, touch|ing
the young lady, &s;hould &s;eek to compromi&s;e
the affair, by offering her in marriage to her
debaucher; a proffer, which, if accepted, would
overwhelm the mo her with vexation and de&s;pair.
He therefore cho&s;e to tru&s;t to the effects of
lenient time, which he hoped would gradually
weaken the re&s;entment of this Penthe&s;ilea, and
<PB N="109" REF="118">
di&s;&s;olve his connexion with the other parts of the
family, from which he longed to be totally de|ached.</P>
<P>How well &s;oever he might have &s;ucceeded in
his attempts to &s;hake off the yoke of the mother,
who by her &s;ituation in life was re&s;trained from
pro&s;ecuting tho&s;e mea&s;ures her re&s;entment had
planned again&s;t his fortitude and indifference;
he would have found greater difficulty than he
had fore&s;een, in di&s;engaging him&s;elf from the
daughter, who&s;e affections he had won under
the mo&s;t &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ions of honour and fide|lity;
and who, now &s;he was debarred of his com|pany
and conver&s;ation, and in danger of lo&s;ing
him for ever, had actually taken the re&s;olution
of di&s;clo&s;ing the amour to her father, that he

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Our hero departs from Vienna, and quits the do|main
of Venus for the rough field of Mars.</HEAD>
<P>LUckily for our adventurer, before he ad|hered
to this determination, the young
count de Melvile was &s;ummoned to Presburg
by his father, who de&s;ired to &s;ee him, before
he &s;hould take the field, in con&s;equence of a
rupture between the emperor and the French
king; and Fathom of cour&s;e, quitted Vienna,
in order to attend his patron, after he and Re|naldo
had re&s;ided two whole years in that capital,
where the former had made him&s;elf perfect in
all the polite exerci&s;es, become ma&s;ter of the
<PB N="110" REF="119">
French tongue, and learned to &s;peak the Italian
with great facility; over and above tho&s;e other
accompli&s;hments in which we have repre&s;ented
him as an inimitable original.</P>
<P>As for the young count, his exteriors were &s;o
much improved by the company to which he
had acce&s;s, &s;ince his departure from his father's
hou&s;e, that his parents were equally &s;urpri&s;ed
and overjoyed at the alteration. All that auk|wardne&s;s
and ru&s;ticity, which hung upon his de|portment,
was, like the rough coat of a diamond,
poli&s;hed away; the connexion and dispo&s;ition of
his limbs &s;eemed to have been adju&s;ted anew;
his carriage was become ea&s;y, his air perfectly
genteel, and his conver&s;ation gay and unre&s;train|ed.
The merit of this reformation was in a
great mea&s;ure a&s;cribed to the care and example
of Mr. Fathom, who was received by the old
count and his lady with marks of &s;ingular friend|&s;hip
and e&s;teem; nor was he over-looked by
Mademoi&s;elle, who &s;till remained in a &s;tate of
celibacy, and &s;eemed to have re&s;igned all hope
of altering her condition; &s;he expre&s;&s;ed uncom|mon
&s;atisfaction at the return of her old favour|ite,
and re-admitted him into the &s;ame degree
of familiarity with which he had been honoured
before his departure.</P>
<P>The joy of Tere&s;a was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive at his ar|rival,
that &s;he could &s;carce &s;uppre&s;s her raptures,
&s;o as to conceal them from the notice of the
family; and our here, upon this occa&s;ion, per|formed
the part of an exqui&s;ite actor, in di&s;&s;em|bling
tho&s;e tran&s;ports which his bo&s;om never
know. So well had this pupil retained the le&s;|&s;ons
of her in&s;tructor, that in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e
fraudulent appropriations, which &s;he &s;till conti|nued
<PB N="111" REF="120">
to make, &s;he had found means to &s;upport
her intere&s;t and character with Mademoi&s;elle,
and even to acquire &s;uch influence in the fa|mily,
that no other &s;ervant male or female,
could pretend to live under the &s;ame roof, with|out
paying ince&s;&s;ant homage to this artful wait|ing-woman,
and yielding the mo&s;t abject &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to her will.</P>
<P>The young gentlemen having tarried at Pre&s;|burg
about &s;ix weeks, during which a &s;mall
field equipage was prepared for Renaldo, they
repaired to the camo at Heilbron, under the
au&s;pices of count Melvile, in who&s;e regiment
they carried arms, as volunteers, with a view to
merit promotion in the &s;ervice, by their own
per&s;onal behaviour. Our adventurer would have
willingly di&s;pen&s;ed with this occa&s;ion of &s;ignaliz|ing
him&s;elf, his talents being much better a|dapted
to another &s;phere of life; neverthele&s;s,
he affected uncommon alacrity at the pro&s;pect of
gathering laurels in the field, and &s;ub&s;cribed to
his fortune with a good grace; for&s;eeing that
even in a campaign, a man of his art and inge|nuity,
might find means to con&s;ult his corporal
&s;afety, without any danger to his reputation.
Accordingly, before he had lived full three weeks
in camp, the damp &s;ituation and &s;udden change
in his way of life, had &s;uch a violent effect up|on
his con&s;titution, that he was deprived of the
u&s;e of all his limbs, and mourned without cea|&s;ing,
his hard fate, by which he found him|&s;elf
precluded from all opportunity of exert|ing
his diligence, courage and activity, in the
character of a &s;oldier, to which he now a&s;|pired.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="121">
Renaldo, who was actually enamoured of a
martial life, and mi&s;&s;ed no occa&s;ion of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
him&s;elf, con&s;oled his companion, with
great cordiality, encouraged him with the hope
of &s;eeing his con&s;titution familiarized to the in|conveniences
of a camp, and accommodated
him with every thing which he thought would
alleviate the pain of his body, as well as the
anxiety of his mind. The old count, who &s;in|cerely
&s;ympathized with his affliction, would
have per&s;uaded him to retire into quarters, where
he could be carefully nur&s;ed, and provided with
every thing nece&s;&s;ary to a per&s;on in his condi|tion;
but, &s;uch was his de&s;ire of glory, that
he re&s;i&s;ted his patron's importunities, with great
con&s;tancy, till at length, &s;eeing the old gentle|man
ob&s;tinately determined to con&s;ult his health,
by removing him from the field, he gradually
&s;uffered him&s;elf to recover the u&s;e of his hands,
made &s;hift to &s;it up in his bed, and amu&s;e him|&s;elf
with cards or back gammon, and notwith|&s;tanding
the feeble condition of his legs, ventur|ed
to ride out on hor&s;eback, to vi&s;it the lines;
though the count and his &s;on would never yield
to his &s;olicitations &s;o far, as to let him accom|pany
Renaldo in tho&s;e excur&s;ions and reconnoit|ring
parties by which a volunteer inures him|&s;elf
to toil and peril, and acquires that know|ledge
in the operations of war, which qualifies
him for a command in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this exemption from all duty,
our adventurer managed matters &s;o as to pa&s;s
for a youth of infinite mettle, and even ren|dered
his backwardne&s;s and timidity &s;ub&s;ervient
to the &s;upport of that character, by expre&s;&s;ing
an impatience of lying inactive, and a de&s;ire
<PB N="113" REF="122">
of &s;ignalizing his prowe&s;s, which even the di&s;|abled
condition of his body could &s;carce re&s;train.
He mu&s;t be a man of very weak nerves and ex|ce&s;&s;ive
irre&s;olution, who can live in the mid&s;t of
actual &s;ervice, without imbibing &s;ome portion of
military fortitude; danger become$ habitual, and
lo&s;es a great part of its terror; and as fear is of|ten
caught by contagion, &s;o is courage commu|nicated
among the individuals of an army.
The hope of fame, de&s;ire of honours and pre|ferment,
envy, emulation, and the dread of
di&s;grace, are motives which co-operate in &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing
that aver&s;ion to death or mutilation,
which nature hath implanted in the human mind;
and therefore, it is not to be wondered at, if
Fathom, who was naturally chicken-hearted,
gained &s;ome advantages over his di&s;po&s;ition, be|fore
the end of the campaign, which happened
to be neither perilous nor &s;evere.</P>
<P>During the winter, while both armies remain|ed
in quarters, our adventurer attended his pa|tron
to Presburg, and before the troops were
in motion, Renaldo obtained a commi&s;&s;ion, in
con&s;equence of which, he went into garri&s;on at
Philip&s;burg, whither he was followed by our
hero, while the old count's duty called him to
the field in a different place. Ferdinand, for
&s;ome time had no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with
this di&s;po&s;ition, by which he was at once deli|vered
from the fatigues of a campaign, and the
in&s;pection of a &s;evere cen&s;or, in the per&s;on of
count Melvile; and his &s;atisfaction was &s;till in|crea&s;ed
by an accidental meeting with the Tyro|le&s;e,
who had been his confederate at Vienna,
and now chanced to &s;erve in garri&s;on, on the
&s;ame footing with him&s;elf. The&s;e two knights|errant
<PB N="114" REF="123">
renewed their former corre&s;pondence, a$$
as all &s;oldiers are addicted to gaming, levied con|tributions
upon all tho&s;e officers who had mo|ney
to lo&s;e, and temerity to play.</P>
<P>However they had not long pur&s;ued the
branch of traffic, when their &s;ucce&s;s was inter|rupted
by a very &s;erious occurrence, that $word$
the pre&s;ent intirely detached the gentlemen
the garri&s;on from &s;uch amu&s;ements. The French
troops inve&s;ted fort Kehl, &s;ituated on the Rhi$$
oppo&s;ite to Stra&s;burg, and the Imperiali&s;ts dre$$|ing
that the next &s;torm would fall upon Philip$
burg, employed them&s;elves with great diligence
to put that important &s;ortre&s;s in a proper p$$|ture
of defence. If the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of play w$$
di&s;plea&s;ing to our hero, the expectation of being
be&s;ieged was by no means more agreeable. $word$
knew the excellence of the French engineer$
the power of their artillery, and the per&s;everance
of their general: he felt, by anticipation, th$
toils of hard duty upon the works, the horro$
of night-alarms, cannonading, bombardment
&s;allies and mines blown up; and deliberate$
with him&s;elf, whether or not he &s;hould private$
withdraw, and take refuge among the be&s;iege$$
but, when he reflected that &s;uch a &s;tep
be&s;ides the infamy that mu&s;t attend it, would
be like that of running upon Scylla, &s;eeking to
avoid Char bdis, $s he would be expo&s;ed t$
more danger and inconvenience in the trenche$
than he could po&s;&s;ibly undergo in the town, $word$
after all run the ri&s;que of being taken and treated
as a de&s;erter; upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, he $word$

to mitigate the rigour of his fate, by tho&s;e arts $word$
<PB N="115" REF="124">
had formerly practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s. He ac|cordingly
found means to enjoy a very bad &s;tate
of health during the whole &s;iege, which la&s;ted
about &s;ix weeks after the trenches were opened;
and then the garri&s;on marched out by capitula|tion,
with all the honours of war.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He puts him&s;elf under the guidance of his a&s;&s;ociate,
and &s;tumbles upon the French camp, where he
fini&s;hes his military carreer.</HEAD>
<P>NOthing el&s;e of moment was tran&s;acted
during that campaign; and in the winter,
our adventurer, with the young count, and his
friend the Tyrole&s;e, were d$&s;po&s;ed in quarters
of cantonment, where Ferdinand made him&s;elf
amends for the chagrin he had undergone, by
the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e talents in which he excelled.
Not that he was &s;atisfied with the &s;phere of life
in which he acted; though he knew him&s;elf
con&s;ummate in the art of play, he was not at
all ambitious of a game&s;ter's name; nor did he
find him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to hazard tho&s;e di&s;coveries
and explanations to which heroes of that cla&s;s
are &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed. His aim was
to dwell among the tents of civil life, undi&s;turb|ed
by quarrels and the din of war, and render
mankind &s;ub&s;ervient to his intere&s;t, not by &s;tra|tagems
which irritate, but by that &s;upplene&s;s of
in&s;inuation, which could not fail to &s;ooth the
temper of tho&s;e on whom he meant to prey.</P>
<P>He &s;aw, that all his expectations of count Mel|vile's
future favour, were connected with his
choice of a military life; and that his promo|tion
<PB N="116" REF="125">
in the &s;ervice would, in a great mea&s;ure,
depend upon his per&s;onal behaviour in &s;uch
emergencies as he did not at all wi&s;h to encoun|ter.
On the other hand, he con&s;ided &s;o much
in his own dexterity and addre&s;s, that he never
doubted of being able to rear a &s;plendid fortune
for him&s;elf, provided he could once obtain a
fixed and firm foundation. He had in fancy,
often enjoyed a pro&s;pect of England, not
only as his native country, to which, like a true
citizen, he longed to be united; but al&s;o as the
land of promi&s;e, flowing with milk and honey,
and abounding with &s;ubjects on which he knew
his talents would be properly exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections never occurred, without
leaving a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of our
adventurer, which influenced his deliberations,
in &s;uch a manner, as at length amounted to a
perfect re&s;olution of withdrawing him&s;elf pri|vately
from a &s;ervice that teemed with di&s;a|greeable
events; and of tran&s;porting him&s;elf
into the country of his ance&s;tors, which he con|&s;idered
as the Canaan of all able adventurers.
But, previous to his appearance on that &s;tage,
he was de&s;irous of vi&s;iting the metropolis of
France, in which he hoped to improve him&s;elf
in the knowledge of men and things, and ac|quire
&s;uch intelligence as would qualify him to
act a more important part upon the Briti&s;h &s;cene.
After having for &s;ometime indulged the&s;e pro&s;pects
in &s;ecret, he determined to accommodate him|&s;elf
with the company and experience of the
Tyrole&s;e, whom, under the &s;pecious title of an
a&s;&s;ociate, he knew he could convert into a very
&s;erviceable tool, in forwarding the execution of his
own projects.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="126">
Accordingly, the inclination of this confede|rate,
was founded by di&s;tant hints, and being
found apt, our hero made him privy to his de|&s;ign
of decamping without beat of drum; though,
at the &s;ame time, he begged his advice, touch|ing
the method of their departure, that he might
retire with as much delicacy as the nature of
&s;uch a &s;tep would permit. Divers con&s;ultations
were held upon this &s;ubject, before they adhered
to the re&s;olution of making their e&s;cape from
the army, after it &s;hould have taken the field in
the &s;pring; becau&s;e, in that ca&s;e, they would
have frequent opportunities of going abroad on
foraging parties, and during one of the&s;e excur|&s;ions,
might retire in &s;uch a manner as to per|&s;uade
their companions, that they had fallen into
the enemy's hands.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this determination, the camp
was no &s;ooner formed in Al&s;ace, than our a&s;&s;o|ciates
began to make preparations for their march,
and had already taken all the previous mea&s;ures
for their departure, when an accident happened,
which our hero did not fail to convert to his
own advantage: this was no other than the de|&s;ertion
of Renaldo's valet, who, in con&s;equence
of a gentle cha&s;ti&s;ement, which he had richly
merited, thought proper to di&s;appear, after having
plundered his ma&s;ter's portmanteau, which he had
forced open for the purpo&s;e. Ferdinand, who was
the fir&s;t per&s;on that di&s;covered the theft, imme|diately
comprehended the whole adventure, and
taking it for granted, that the delinquent would
never return, re&s;olved to fini&s;h what the fugitive
had imperfectly performed.</P>
<P>Being favoured with the unre&s;erved confidence
of the young count, he in&s;tantly had recour&s;e
<PB N="118" REF="127">
to his bureau, the locks of which, he found means
to bur&s;t open, and examining a private drawer
contrived with great art to conceal Renaldo's
jewels and ca&s;h, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the
contents without he&s;itation; then cutting open
his cloak bag, and &s;trewing the tent with his
linnen and cloaths, began to rai&s;e his voice, and
produce &s;uch a clamour as alarmed the whole
neighbourhood, and brought a great many officers
into the tent.</P>
<P>He on this, as on all other occa&s;ions, per|formed
his cue to a miracle, expre&s;&s;ing confu&s;ion
and concern &s;o naturally, in his ge&s;tures and ex|clamation,
that no man could po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;pect
his &s;incerity; nay, to &s;uch a degree of fine&s;&s;e
did his cunning amount, that when his friend
and patron entered, in con&s;equence of an inti|mation
he &s;oon received of his lo&s;s, our ad|venturer
exhibited undoubted &s;igns of di&s;trac|tion
and delirium, and &s;pringing upon Renaldo
with all the frantic fury of a bedlamite, &startq;Vil|lain!&endq;
cried he, &startq;re&s;tore the effects you have
&s;tole from your ma&s;ter, or you &s;hall be immedi|ately
committed to the care of the pr&ecirc;vot.&endq;
However mortified M. de Melvile might be, at
his own misfortune, the condition of his friend
&s;eemed to touch him more nearly; he under|valued
his own lo&s;s, as a trifle that could be
ea&s;ily repaired, &s;aid every thing which he thought
would tend to &s;ooth and compo&s;e the agitation
of Ferdinand, and finally prevailed upon him
to retire to re&s;t. The calamity was wholly
attributed to the de&s;erter, and Renaldo, far from
&s;u&s;pecting the true author, took occa&s;ion, from
his behaviour on this emergency, to admire him
as a mirrour of integrity and attachment; in
<PB N="119" REF="128">
&s;uch an exqui&s;ite manner did he plan all his de|&s;igns,
that almo&s;t every in&s;tance of his fraud
furni&s;hed matter of triumph to his reputation.</P>
<P>Having thus profitably exerci&s;ed his genius,
this &s;ubtle politician, thought it high time to
relinqui&s;h his military expectations, and &s;ecuring
all his valuable acqui&s;itions about his own per&s;on,
rode out with his under&s;trapper, in the mid&s;t of
fifty dragoons who went in que&s;t of forage.
While the troopers were employed in making up
their tru&s;&s;es, the two adventurers advanced to|wards
the &s;kirt of a wood, on pretence of re|connoitring,
and the Tyroleze, who undertook
to be our hero's guide, directing him to a path
which led towards Stra&s;burg, they &s;uddenly va|ni&s;hed
from the eyes of their companions, who
in a few minutes hearing the report of &s;everal
pi&s;tols, which the confederates purpo&s;ely fired,
conjectured that they had fallen in with a party
of French, by whom they were made pri&s;oners
of war.</P>
<P>The T$roleze had over-rated his own know|ledge,
when he took upon him&s;elf the charge of
conducting our hero; for, upon their arrival at
a certain place, where two roads cro&s;&s;ed each
other, he chanced to follow that which not only
fru&s;trated their intention, but even led them di|rectly
to the French camp: &s;o that in the twi|light
they fell in upon one of the out-guards, be|fore
they were aware of their mi&s;take. What|ever
confu&s;ion and perplexity they might under|go,
when they heard them&s;elves que&s;tioned by
the cent$nel on the advanced po&s;t, certain it is,
they betrayed no &s;ymptoms of fear or di&s;order;
but while Ferdinand endeavoured to recollect
him&s;elf, his fellow-traveller, with the appearance
<PB N="120" REF="129">
of admirable intrepidity and pre&s;ence of mind,
told the &s;oldier, that he and his companion were
two gentlemen of family, who had quitted the
Au&s;trian army, on account of having &s;u&s;tained
&s;ome ill-u&s;age, which they had no opportunity
of re&s;enting in any other way; and that they
were come to offer their &s;ervices to the French
general, to who&s;e quarters they de&s;ired to be
immediately conveyed.</P>
<P>The centinel, to whom &s;uch an in&s;tance of
de&s;ertion was neither rare, nor indeed uncommon,
directed them without &s;cruple to the next po&s;t,
where they found a &s;erjeant's party, from which,
at their reque&s;t, they were tran&s;mitted to the
officer of the grand guard, and by him, next
morning, introduced to count Coigny, who very
politely received them as volunteers in the army
of France. Though this tran&s;lation was not at
all to our hero's liking, he was forced to ac|quie&s;ce
in his fate, glad to find him&s;elf, on the&s;e
terms, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his effects, of which he
would otherwi&s;e have been infallibly rifled.</P>
<P>This campaign, however, was the mo&s;t di&s;a|greeable
period of his whole life; becau&s;e the
manner in which he had entered into the &s;ervice,
&s;ubjected him to the particular ob&s;ervation and
notice of the French officers; &s;o that he was ob|liged
to be very alert in his duty, and &s;ummon
all his fortitude to maintain the character he had
a&s;&s;umed. What rendered his &s;ituation &s;till more
unpalatable, was the activity of both armies in
the cour&s;e of this &s;ea&s;on, during which, over
and above &s;undry fatiguing marches and counter-marches,
he was per&s;onally engaged in the affair
of Hallch, which was very ob&s;tinate, where
being in the &s;kirts of the detachment, he was
<PB N="121" REF="130">
actually wounded in the face by the &s;word of an
hu&s;&s;ar; but this was, luckily for him, the la&s;t
time he found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of ex|erting
his military prowe&s;s; for a ce&s;&s;ation of
arms was proclaimed, before he was cured of
his wound, and peace concluded about the end
of the campaign.</P>
<P>During his &s;ojourn in the French camp, he
a&s;&s;umed the character of a man of family, who
being di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;ome &s;upercilious treatment he
had met with, in the German &s;ervice, and at
the &s;ame time ambitious of carrying arms under
the banners of France, took the opportunity of
retreating by &s;tealth from his friends, accom|panied
only by one with whom he could en|tru&s;t
his intention. In this capacity, he had ma|naged
his matters to &s;uch advantage, that many
French officers of rank were very well di&s;po&s;ed
to contribute their intere&s;t in his behalf, had his
inclination verged towards promotion in the
army; but he thought proper to conceal his
real de&s;ign, under the &s;pecious pretext of longing
to &s;ee the metropolis of France, that centre of
plea&s;ure and politene&s;s, in which he propo&s;ed to
&s;pend &s;ome time for the improvement of his ad|dre&s;s
and under&s;tanding. The&s;e were motives
too laudable to be oppo&s;ed by his new patrons,
&s;ome of whom furni&s;hed him with letters of
recommendation to certain noblemen of the fir&s;t
rank at the court of Ver&s;ailles, for which place
he and his companion &s;et out from the banks of
the Rhine, very well &s;atisfied with the honourable
di&s;mi&s;&s;ion they had obtained from a life of incon|venience,
danger and alarm.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He prepares a &s;tratagem, but finds him&s;elf counter|mined;
proceeds on his journey, and is overtaken
by a terrible tempe&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of this journey, Ferdinand,
who was never deficient in his political capa|city,
held a &s;ecret conclave with his own
thoughts, not only touching the plan of his own
future conduct, but al&s;o concerning his a&s;&s;ociate,
of who&s;e fidelity and adherence he began to
entertain &s;uch doubts as di&s;couraged him from
the pro&s;ecution of that de&s;ign, in which the Ty|roleze
had been at fir&s;t included: for, he had
lately ob&s;erved him practi&s;e the arts of his occu|pation
among the French officers, with &s;uch ra|pacity
and want of caution, as indicated a dan|gerous
temerity of temper, as well as a furious
rage of acquiring, which might be &s;ometime or
other, &s;atiated upon his own friends. In other
words, our adventurer was afraid that his ac|complice
would profit by his knowledge of the
road and countries through which they travelled,
and after having made free with his mo&s;t valua|ble
effects, in con&s;equence of the familiarity
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, leave him &s;ome
morning without the ceremony of a formal
adieu.</P>
<P>Arrou&s;ed by this &s;u&s;picion, he re&s;olved to an|ticipate
the &s;uppo&s;ed intention of the Tyroleze,
by taking his own departure in the &s;ame abrupt
manner; and this &s;cheme he actually put in exe|cution,
upon their arrival in Bar le duc, where
it was agreed they &s;hould &s;pend a day to repo&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="132">
and refre&s;h them&s;elves from the fatigue of hard
riding. Ferdinand, therefore, taking the ad|vantage
of his companion's ab&s;ence, for the
Tyroleze had walked abroad to view the town,
found means to hire a pea&s;ant, who undertook
to conduct him through a bye-road, as far as
Chalons, and with this guide, he accordingly
&s;et out on hor&s;eback, after having di&s;charged
the bill, left a blank paper &s;ealed up in form of a
letter, directed to his friend, and &s;ecured be|hind
his own &s;addle, a pair of leathern bags in
which his jewels and ca&s;h were u&s;ually contained.
So eager was our hero to leave the Tyroleze at
a con&s;iderable di&s;tance behind, that he rode all
night at a round pace, without halting, and next
morning, found him&s;elf at a village di&s;tant thir|teen
good leagues, from any part of the route,
which he and his companion had at fir&s;t re&s;olved
to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Here thinking him&s;elf &s;afely delivered from the
cau&s;e of all his apprehen&s;ion, he determined to
lie incognito for a few days, &s;o as that he might
run no ri&s;que of an accidental meeting upon the
road, with the per&s;on who&s;e company he had
for&s;aken; and accordingly he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
an apartment, in which he went to re&s;t, de&s;ir|ing
his guide to wake him, when dinner &s;hould
be ready. Having enjoyed a very comfortable
refre&s;hment of &s;leep, with his bags under his
pillow, he was &s;ummoned according to his di|rection,
and ate a very hearty meal with great
tranquillity and internal &s;atisfaction. In the af|ternoon,
he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with happy pre&s;ages,
and ideal pro&s;pects of his future fortune, and
in the mid&s;t of the&s;e imaginary banquets was
&s;eized with an inclination of realizing his bli&s;s,
<PB N="124" REF="133">
and regaling his eye &s;ight with the fruits of that
&s;ucce&s;s, which had hitherto attended his endea|vours.
Thus inflamed, he opened the repo|&s;itory,
and O reader! what were his reflections,
when in lieu of mademoi&s;elle Melvile's ear|rings
and necklace, the German's golden chain,
divers jewels of con&s;iderable value, the &s;poils
of &s;undry dupes, and about two hundred ducats
in ready money, he found neither more nor le&s;s
than a parcel of ru&s;ty nails, di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a
manner as to re&s;emble in weight and bulk the
moveables he had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, our adventurer made
this di&s;covery without emotion. If the eternal
&s;alvation of mankind could have been purcha&s;ed
for the tenth part of his trea&s;ure, he would have
left the whole &s;pecies in a &s;tate of reprobation,
rather than redeem them at that price, unle&s;s
he had &s;een in the bargain, &s;ome evident advan|tage
to his own concerns: one may therefore
ea&s;ily conceive with what milkine&s;s of re&s;ignation,
he bore the lo&s;s of the whole, and &s;aw him&s;elf
reduced from &s;uch affluence, to the nece&s;&s;ity
of depending upon about twenty ducats, and
&s;ome loo&s;e &s;ilver which he carried in his pocket,
for his expence upon the road. However bitter
this pill might be in &s;wallowing, he &s;o far ma&s;|tered
his mortification, as to dige&s;t it with a
good grace: his own penetration at once, pointed
out the canal through which this misfortune had
flowed upon him; he forthwith placed the cala|mity
to the account of the Tyroleze, and never
doubting that he had retired with the booty
acro&s;s the Rhine, into &s;ome place to which he
knew Fathom would not follow his foot&s;teps,
he formed the melancholy re&s;olution of pur&s;uing
<PB N="125" REF="134">
with all di&s;patch, his journey to Paris, that he
might with all convenient expedition, indemnify
him&s;elf for the di&s;comfiture he had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>With regard to his confederate, his conjecture
was perfectly right; that adventurer, though in|finitely
inferior to our hero in point of genius
and invention, had manife&s;tly the advantage of
him, in the articles of age and experience; he
was no &s;tranger to Fathom's qualifications, the
happy exertion of which he had often &s;een. He
knew him to be an oeconomi&s;t of the mo&s;t fru|gal
order, con&s;equently concluded his finances
were worthy of examination; and upon the true
principles of a &s;harper, ea&s;ed him of the incum|brance,
taking it for granted, that in &s;o doing,
he only precluded Ferdinand from the power of
acting the &s;ame tragedy upon him, &s;hould ever
opportunity concur with his inclination. He had
therefore concerted his mea&s;ures with the dexte|rity
of an experienced conveyancer, and &s;natch|ing
the occa&s;ion, while our hero travel-tainted,
lay &s;unk in the arms of profound repo&s;e, he ript
up the &s;eams of the leathern depo&s;itory, with|drew
the contents, introduced the parcel of
nails, which he had made up for the purpo&s;e,
and then repaired the breach with great delibe|ration.</P>
<P>Had Fathom's good genius prompted him to
examine his effects next morning, the Tyro|leze,
in all probability, would have maintained
his acqui&s;ition by force of arms; for his per|&s;onal
courage was rather more determined than
that of our adventurer, and he was con&s;cious of
his own a&s;cendancy in this particular; but, his
good fortune prevented &s;uch explanation. Imme|diately
after dinner, he availed him&s;elf of his
<PB N="126" REF="135">
knowledge, and betaking him&s;elf to a remote
part of the town, &s;et out in a po&s;t-chai&s;e for
Luneville, while our hero was meditating his
own e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Fathom's conception was &s;ufficient to compre|hend
the whole of this adventure, as &s;oon as his
chagrin would give his &s;agacity fair play; nor
would he allow his re&s;olution to &s;ink under the
trial; on the contrary, he departed from the
village, that &s;ame afternoon, under the au&s;pices
of his conductor, and found him&s;elf benighted
in the mid&s;t of a fore&s;t far from the habitations
of men; the darkne&s;s of the night, the &s;ilence
and &s;olitude of the place, the indi&s;tinct images
of the trees that appeared on every &s;ide, &startq;&s;tretch|ing
their extravagant arms athwart the gloom,&endq;
con&s;pired with the dejection of &s;pirits occa&s;ioned
by his lo&s;s to di&s;turb his fancy, and rai&s;e &s;trange
phantoms in his imagination. Although he was
not naturally &s;uper&s;titious, his mind began to
be invaded with an awful horror, that gradually
prevailed over all the con&s;olations of rea&s;on and
philo&s;ophy; nor was his heart free from the
terrors of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. In order to di&s;&s;ipate the&s;e
di&s;agreeable reveries, he had recour&s;e to the con|ver&s;ation
of his guide, by whom he was enter|tained
with the hi&s;tory of divers travellers, who
had been robbed and murdered by ruffians,
who&s;e retreat was in the rece&s;&s;es of that very
wood.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this communication, which
did not at all tend to the elevation of our
hero's &s;pirits, the conductor made an excu&s;e for
dropping behind, while our traveller jogged on
in expectation of being joined again by him in a
few minutes: he was however di&s;appointed in
<PB N="127" REF="136">
that hope: the &s;ound of the other hor&s;e's feet,
by degrees, grew more and more faint, and at
la&s;t, altogether died away. Alarmed at this cir|cum&s;tance,
Fathom halted in the middle of the
road, and li&s;tened with the mo&s;t fearful atten|tion;
but his &s;en&s;e of hearing was &s;aluted with
nought but the di&s;mal &s;ighings of the trees, that
&s;eemed to foretell an approaching &s;torm; accord|ingly
the Heavens contracted a more dreary a&s;|pect,
the lightning began to gleam, the thunder
to roll, and the tempe&s;t rai&s;ing its voice to
a tremendous roar, de&s;cended in a torrent of
rain.</P>
<P>In this emergency, the fortitude of our hero
was almo&s;t quite overcome; &s;o many concur|ing
circum&s;tances of danger and di&s;tre&s;s, might
have appalled the mo&s;t undaunted brea&s;t; what
impre&s;&s;ion then mu&s;t they have made upon the
mind of Ferdinand, who was by no means a
man to &s;et fear at defiance! indeed, he had well
nigh lo&s;t the u&s;e of his reflection, and was actu|ally
invaded to the &s;kin, before he could recol|lect
him&s;elf &s;o far as to quit the road, and &s;eek
for &s;helter among the thickets that &s;urrounded
them. Having rode &s;ome furlongs into the fo|re&s;t,
he took his &s;tation under a tuft of tall trees,
that &s;creened him from the &s;torm, and in that
&s;ituation called a council within him&s;elf, to de|liberate
upon his next excur&s;ion. He per&s;uaded
him&s;elf that his guide had de&s;erted him for the
pre&s;ent, in order to give intelligence of a travel|ler,
to &s;ome gang of robbers with whom he was
connected; and that he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity fall a
prey to tho&s;e banditti, unle&s;s he &s;hould have the
good fortune to elude their &s;earch, and di&s;entan|gle
him&s;elf from the mazes of the wood.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="137">
Harrowed with the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, he re&s;olv|ed
to commit him&s;elf to the mercy of the hur|ricane,
as of two evils the lea&s;t, and penetrate
&s;treight forwards through &s;ome devious opening,
until he &s;hould be delivered from the fore&s;t. For
this purpo&s;e, he turned his hor&s;e's head in a line,
quite contrary to the direction of the high-road
which he had left, on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the
robbers would pur&s;ue that tract in que&s;t of him,
and that they would never dream of his de&s;ert|ing
the highway, to traver&s;e an unknown for|re&s;t,
amid&s;t the darkne&s;s of &s;uch a boi&s;terous
night. After he had continued in this progre&s;s, thro'
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of groves, and bogs, and thorns and
brakes, by which, not only his cloaths, but
al&s;o his &s;kin &s;uffered in a grievous manner, while
every nerve quivered with eagerne&s;s of di&s;may;
he at length reached an open plain, and pur&s;u|ing
his cour&s;e, in full hope of arriving at &s;ome
village, where his life would be &s;afe, he de&s;cried
a ru&s;h light at a di&s;tance, which he looked upon
as the &s;tar of his good fortune, and riding to|wards
it at full &s;peed, arrived at the door of a
lone cottage, into which he was admitted by an
old woman, who under&s;tanding he was a be|wildered
traveller, received him with great ho&s;|pitality.</P>
<P>When he learned from his ho&s;te&s;s, that there
was not another hou&s;e within three leagues, that
&s;he could accommodate him with a tolerable
bed, and his hor&s;e with lodging and oats, he
thanked Heaven for his good fortune in &s;tum|bling
upon this homely habitation, and deter|mined
to pa&s;s the night under the protection of
the old cottager, who gave him to under&s;tand
that her hu&s;band, who was a faggot-maker, had
<PB N="129" REF="138">
gone to the next town to di&s;po&s;e of his merchan|dize,
and that in all probability, he would not
return till next morning, on account of the
tempe&s;tuous night. Ferdinand &s;ounded the bel|dame
with a thou&s;and artful interrogations, and
&s;he an&s;wered with &s;uch appearance of truth and
&s;implicity, that he concluded his per&s;on was
quite &s;ecure; and after having been regaled with
a di&s;h of eggs and bacon, de&s;ired &s;he would
conduct him into the chamber where &s;he propo|&s;ed
he &s;hould take his repo&s;e. He was accord|ingly
u&s;hered up by a &s;ort of ladder, into an apart|ment
furni&s;hed with a &s;tanding-bed, and almo&s;t
half filled with tru&s;&s;es of &s;traw. He &s;eemed
extremely well plea&s;ed with his lodging, which
in reality exceeded his expectation, and his kind
landlady cautioning him again&s;t letting the can|dle
approach the combu&s;tibles, took her leave,
and locked the door on the out&s;ide.</P>

<P>FAthom, who&s;e own principles taught him
to be &s;u&s;picious, and ever upon his guard
again&s;t the treachery of his fellow creatures,
could have di&s;pen&s;ed with this in&s;tance of her
care in confining her gue&s;t to her chamber, and
began to be &s;eized with &s;trange fancies, when
he ob&s;erved that there was no bolt on the in&s;ide
of the door, by which he might &s;ecure him&s;elf
from intru&s;ion. In con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;|tions,
he propo&s;ed to take an accurate &s;urvey of
every object in the apartment, and in the cour&s;e
of his inquiry, had the mortification to find the

dead body of a man, &s;till warm, who had been
lately &s;tabbed, and concealed beneath &s;everal bun|dles
of &s;traw.</P>
<P>Such a di&s;covery could not fail to fill the brea&s;t
of our hero, with un&s;peakable horror; for he
concluded that he him&s;elf would undergo the
&s;ame fate before morning, without the interpo|&s;ition
of a miracle in his favour. In the fir&s;t
tran&s;ports of his dread, he ran to the window
with a view to e&s;cape by that outlet, and found
his flight effectually ob&s;tructed by divers &s;trong
bars of iron. Then his heart began to palpi|tate,
his hair to bri&s;tle up, and his knees to tot|ter;
his thoughts teemed with pre&s;ages of death
and de&s;truction; his con&s;cience ro&s;e up in judg|ment
again&s;t him, and he underwent a &s;evere
paroxy&s;m of di&s;may and di&s;traction. His &s;pirits
were agitated into a &s;tate of fermentation that
produced a &s;pecies of re&s;olution a-kin to that
which is in&s;pired by brandy or other &s;trong
liquors, and by an impul&s;e that &s;eemed &s;uperna|tural,
he was immediately hurried into mea|&s;ures
for his own pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>What upon a le&s;s intere&s;ting occa&s;ion his ima|gination
dur&s;t not propo&s;e, he now executed
without &s;cruple or remor&s;e: he undre&s;&s;ed the
corp&s;e that lay bleeding among the &s;traw, and
conveying it to the bed in his arms, depo&s;ited
it in the attitude of a per&s;on who &s;leeps at his
ea&s;e; then he extingui&s;hed the light, took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the place from whence the body had
been removed, and holding a pi&s;tol ready cocked
in each hand, waited for the &s;equel with that
determined purpo&s;e, which is often the imme|diate
production of de&s;pair. About midnight
he heard the &s;ound of feet a&s;cending the ladder,
<PB N="131" REF="140">
the door was &s;oftly opened, he &s;aw the &s;hadow
of two men &s;talking towards the bed, a dark
lanthorn being un&s;hrouded, directed their aim
to the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;leeper, and he that held it, thru&s;t
a poignard to his heart; the force of the blow
made a compre&s;&s;ion on the che&s;t, and a &s;ort of
groan i&s;&s;ued from the windpipe of the defunct;
the &s;troke was repeated, without producing a
repetition of the note, &s;o that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins con|cluded
the work was effectually done, and retired
for the pre&s;ent, with a de&s;ign to return and rifle
the decea&s;ed at their lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>Never had our hero &s;pent a moment in &s;uch
agony, as he felt during this operation; the
whole &s;urface of his body was covered with a
cold &s;weat, and his nerves were relaxed with
an univer&s;al pal&s;y: in &s;hort, he remained in a
trance that, in all probability, contributed to his
&s;afety; for, had he retained the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es,
he might have been di&s;covered by the tran&s;ports
of his fear. The fir&s;t u&s;e he made of his re|trieved
recollection was to perceive that the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins
had left the door open in their retreat; and
he would have in&s;tantly availed him&s;elf of this
their neglect, by &s;allying out upon them, at the
hazard of his life, had not he been re&s;trained
by a conver&s;ation he overheard in the room
below, importing that the ruffians were going
to &s;et out upon another expedition, in hopes of
finding more prey: they accordingly departed,
after having laid &s;trong injunctions upon the old
woman, to keep the door fa&s;t locked during
their ab&s;ence; and Ferdinand took his re&s;olu|tion
without farther delay. So &s;oon as by his
conjecture, the robbers were at a &s;ufficient di&s;|tance
from the hou&s;e, he ro&s;e from his lurking|place,
<PB N="132" REF="141">
moved &s;oftly towards the bed, and rum|maging
the pockets of the decea&s;ed, found a
pur&s;e well &s;tored with ducats, of which, toge|ther
with a &s;ilver watch and a diamond ring, he
immediately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf without &s;cruple;
then de&s;cending with great care and circum&s;pec|tion,
into the lower apartment, &s;tood before the
old beldam, before &s;he had the lea&s;t intimation
of his approach.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed as &s;he was to the trade of blood,
the hoary hag did not behold this apparition
without giving &s;igns of infinite terror and
a&s;toni&s;hment, believing it was no other than the
&s;pirit of her &s;econd gue&s;t who had been mur|dered;
&s;he fell upon her knees, and began to re|commend
her&s;elf to the protection of the &s;aints,
cro&s;&s;ing her&s;elf with as much devotion, as if
&s;he had been intitled to the particular care
and attention of Heaven. Nor did her anxiety
abate, when &s;he was undeceived in this her &s;up|po&s;ition,
and under&s;tood it was no phantom,
but the real &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tranger, who
without &s;taying to upbraid her with the enormity
of her crimes, commanded her on pain of im|mediate
death to produce his hor&s;e, to which
being conducted, he &s;et her upon the &s;addle
without delay, and mounting behind, inve&s;ted
her with the management of the reins, &s;wear|ing
in a mo&s;t peremptory tone, that the only
chance &s;he had for her life, was in directing
him &s;afely to the next town; and that &s;o &s;oon
as &s;he &s;hould give him the lea&s;t cau&s;e to doubt
her fidelity in the performance of that ta&s;k,
he would, on the in&s;tant, act the part of her
executioner.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="142">
This declaration had its effect upon the wi|thered
Hecate, who, with many &s;upplications
for mercy and forgivene&s;s, promi&s;ed to guide him
in &s;afety, to a certain village at the di&s;tance of
two leagues, where he might lodge in &s;ecurity,
and be provided with a fre&s;h hor&s;e, or other
convenience, for pur&s;uing his intended route.
On the&s;e conditions, he told her, &s;he might de|&s;erve
his clemency, and they accordingly took
their departure together, &s;he being placed a&s;tride
upon the &s;addle, holding the bridle in one hand,
and a &s;witch in the other; and our adventurer
&s;itting on the crupper, &s;uperintending her con|duct,
and keeping the muzzle of a pi&s;tol clo&s;e
at her ear. In this equipage, they travelled acro&s;s
part of the &s;ame wood, in which his guide had
for&s;aken him; and it is not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he
pa&s;&s;ed his time in the mo&s;t agreeable reverie,
while he found him&s;elf involved in the labyrinth
of tho&s;e &s;hades, which he con&s;idered as the
haunts of robbery and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>Common fear was a comfortable &s;en&s;ation to
what he felt in this excur&s;ion. The fir&s;t &s;teps he
had taken for his pre&s;ervation, were the effects
of meer in&s;tinct, while his faculties were ex|tingui&s;hed
or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by de&s;pair; but, now as
his reflection began to recur, he was haunted by
the mo&s;t intolerable apprehen&s;ions. Every whi&s;|per
of the wind through the thickets, was &s;well|ed
into the hoar&s;e menaces of murder, the &s;hak|ing
of the boughs was con&s;trued into the bran|di&s;hing
of poignards, and every &s;hadow of a
tree, became the apparition of a ruffian eager
for blood. In &s;hort, at each of the&s;e occurrences,
he felt what was infinitely more tormenting
than the &s;tab of a real dagger; and at every
<PB N="134" REF="143">
fre&s;h &s;ilip of his fear, he acted as remembrancer
to his conductre&s;s, in a new volley of impreca|tions,
importing that her life was ab&s;olutely con|nected
with his opinion of his own &s;afety.</P>
<P>Human nature could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t under
&s;uch complicated terror: at la&s;t he found him|&s;elf
clear of the fore&s;t, and was ble&s;&s;ed with
the di&s;tant view of an inhabited place: he then
began to exerci&s;e his thoughts upon a new &s;ub|ject.
He debated with him&s;elf, whether he
&s;hould make a parade of his intrepidity and pub|lic
&s;pirit, by di&s;clo&s;ing his atchievement and &s;ur|rendring
his guide to the penalty of the law; or
leave the old hag and her accomplices to the re|mor&s;e
of their own con&s;ciences, and proceed
quietly on his journey to Paris, in undi&s;turbed
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prize he had already obtained.
This la&s;t &s;tep he determined to take, upon re|collecting
that in the cour&s;e of his information,
the &s;tory of the murdered &s;tranger would infal|libly
attract the attention of ju&s;tice, and in that
ca&s;e, the effects he had borrowed from the de|funct,
mu&s;t be refunded for the benefit of tho&s;e
who had a right to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This was an
argument which our adventurer could not re&s;i&s;t;
he fore&s;aw that he &s;hould be &s;tript of his acqui|&s;ition,
which he looked upon as the fair fruits of
his valour and &s;agacity; and moreover, be de|tained
as an evidence again&s;t the robbers, to the
manife&s;t detriment of his affairs: perhaps too,
he had motives of con&s;cience that di&s;&s;uaded
him from bearing witne&s;s again&s;t a &s;et of people,
who&s;e principles did not much differ from his
own.</P>
<P>Influenced by &s;uch con&s;iderations, he yielded
to the fir&s;t importunity of the beldam, whom
<PB N="135" REF="144">
he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at a very &s;mall di&s;tance from the vil|lage,
after he had earne&s;tly exhorted her to quit
&s;uch an atrocious cour&s;e of life, and attone for
her pa&s;t crimes, by &s;acrificing her a&s;&s;ociates to
the demands of ju&s;tice. She did not fail to vow
a perfect reformation, and to pro&s;trate her&s;elf
before him, for the favour &s;he had found; then
&s;he betook her&s;elf to her habitation, with full
purpo&s;e of advi&s;ing her fellow-murderers to re|pair
with all di&s;patch to the village, and impeach
our hero, who wi&s;ely di&s;tru&s;ting her profe&s;&s;ions,
&s;taid no longer in the place, than to hire a guide
for the next &s;tage, which brought him to the
city of Chalons &s;ur Marne.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He arrives at Paris, and is plea&s;ed with his re|ception.</HEAD>
<P>HE was not &s;o &s;mitten with the delightful
&s;ituation of this ancient town, but that he
abandoned it as &s;oon as he could procure a po&s;t|chai&s;e,
in which he arrived at Paris, without
having been expo&s;ed to any other trouble&s;ome
adventure upon the road. He took lodgings at
a certain hotel in the Fauxbourg de St. Germain,
which is the general rendezvous of all the
&s;trangers that re&s;ort to this capital; and
now &s;incerely congratulated him&s;elf upon his
happy e&s;cape from his Hungarian connections,
and from the &s;nares of the banditti; as well as
upon the &s;poils of the dead body, and his arrival
at Paris, from whence there was &s;uch a &s;hort
conveyance to England, whither he was attracted
<PB N="136" REF="145">
by far other motives than that of filial venera|tion
for his native &s;oil.</P>
<P>He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all his letters of recommenda|tion,
which he ju&s;tly concluded, would &s;ubject
him to a tedious cour&s;e of attendance upon the
great, and lay him under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ollicit|ing
preferment in the army, than which nothing
was farther from his inclination; and re&s;olved
to make his appearance in the character of a
private gentleman, which would &s;upply him with
opportunities of examining the different &s;cenes
of life in &s;uch a gay metropolis, &s;o as that he
&s;hould be able to chu&s;e that &s;phere in which he
could move the mo&s;t effectually to his own ad|vantage.
He accordingly hired an occa&s;ional
dome&s;tick, and under the denomination of count
Fadome, which he had retained &s;ince his elope|ment
from Renaldo, repaired to dinner at an
ordinary, to which he was directed as a re|putable
place frequented by fa&s;hionable &s;trangers
of all nations.</P>
<P>He found this piece of information perfectly
ju&s;t; for he no &s;ooner entered the apartment,
than his ears were &s;aluted with a &s;trange confu|&s;ion
of &s;ounds, among which he at once di|&s;tingui&s;hed
the high and low Dutch, barbarous
French, Italian and Engli&s;h languages. He was
rejoiced at this occa&s;ion of di&s;playing his own
qualifications; took his place at one of three
long tables, betwixt a We&s;tphalian count, and a
Bolognian marquis, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the
conver&s;ation with his u&s;ual addre&s;s, and in le&s;s
than half an hour, found means to acco&s;t a na|tive
of each different country, in his own mo|ther
tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="146">
Such exten&s;ive knowledge did not pa&s;s unob|&s;erved.
A French abb&eacute;, in a provincial dialect,
complimented him upon his retaining that pu|rity
in pronunciation, which is not to be found
in the &s;peech of a Pari&s;ian. The Bolognian
mi&s;taking him for a Tu&s;can, &startq;Sir, &s;aid he, I
pre&s;ume you are from Florence: I hope the il|lu&s;trious
hou&s;e of Lorrain leaves you gentlemen
of that famous city, no room to regret the lo&s;s
of your own princes.&endq; The ca&s;tle of Ver&s;ailles
becoming the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, mon&s;ieur
le Comte appealed to him as to a native German,
whether it was not inferior in point of magni|ficence
to the Chateau of Grubenhagen: the
Dutch officer addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Fathom,
drank to the pro&s;perity of Faderland, and
asked if he had not once &s;erved in garri&s;on at
Schenken&s;chans; and an Engli&s;h knight &s;wore
with great a&s;&s;urance, that he had frequently
rambled with him at midnight, among the hun|dreds
of Drury.</P>
<P>To each per&s;on he replied in a polite, tho'
my&s;terious manner, which did not fail to inhance
their opinion of his good breeding and import|ance;
and long before the de&s;ert appeared, he
was by all the company &s;uppo&s;ed to be a per&s;o|nage
of great con&s;equence, who for &s;ome &s;ub|&s;tantial
rea&s;ons, found it convenient to keep him|&s;elf
incognito. This being the ca&s;e, it is not
to be doubted that particular civilities were
poured upon him from all quarters: he perceived
their &s;entiments, and encouraged them, by be|having
with that &s;ort of complai&s;ance which
&s;eems to be the re&s;ult of engaging conde&s;cen|&s;ion
in a character of &s;uperior dignity and &s;ta|tion.
His affability was general; but his chief
<PB N="138" REF="147">
attention limited to tho&s;e gentlemen already men|tioned,
who chanced to &s;it neare&s;t him at table;
and he no &s;ooner gave them to under&s;tand that he
was an utter &s;tranger in Paris, than they una|nimou&s;ly
begged to have the honour of making
him acquainted with the different curio&s;ities pe|culiar
to that metropolis.</P>
<P>He accepted of their ho&s;pitality, accom|panied
them to a coffee-hou&s;e in the after|noon,
from whence they repaired to the opera, and
afterwards adjourned to a noted hotel, in order to
&s;pend the remaining part of the evening. It
was here that our hero &s;ecured him&s;elf effectually
in the footing he had gained in their good graces:
he in a moment &s;aw through all the characters
of the partie, and adapted him&s;elf to the humour
of each individual; without de&s;cending from
that elevation of behaviour, which, he perceived,
would operate among them in his behalf. With
the Italian he di&s;cour&s;ed on mu&s;ick, in the &s;tile
of a connoi&s;&s;eur; and indeed had a better claim
to that title than the generality of tho&s;e upon
whom it is u&s;ually conferred; for he under&s;tood
the art in theory as well as in practice, and
would have made no contemptible figure among
the be&s;t performers of the age.</P>
<P>He harangued upon ta&s;te and genius, to the
abb&eacute;, who was a wit and critic, ex officio, or
rather ex ve&s;titu: for, a young pert Frenchman,
the very moment he puts on the petit collet, or
little band, looks upon him&s;elf as an in&s;pired &s;on
of Apollo; and every one of the fraternity
thinks it incumbent upon him to a&s;&s;ert the divi|nity
of his mi&s;&s;ion: in a word, the abb&eacute;s are a
&s;et of people, that bear a &s;trong analogy to the
templars in London. Fools of each fabric,
<PB N="139" REF="148">
&s;harpers of all &s;orts, and dunces of every degree,
profe&s;s them&s;elves of both orders: the templar
is, generally &s;peaking a prig, &s;o is the abb&eacute;:
both are di&s;tingui&s;hed by an air of petulance and
&s;elf-conceit, which holds a middle rank betwixt
the in&s;olence of a fir&s;t rate buck, and the learn|ed
pride of a &s;upercilious pedant. The abb&eacute;
is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a younger brother in que&s;t of
preferment in the church: the temple is con&s;i|dered
as a receptacle or &s;eminary for younger
&s;ons, intended for the bar; but a great number
of each profe&s;&s;ion turn a&s;ide into other paths of
life, long before they reach the&s;e propo&s;ed
goals: an abb&eacute; is often metamorpho&s;ed into a
foot-&s;oldier; a templar &s;ometimes &s;inks into an
attorney's clerk: the gallies of France abound
with abb&eacute;s; and many templars may be found
in our American plantations; not to mention
tho&s;e who have made a public exit nearer home.
Yet, I would not have it thought that my de|&s;cription
includes every individual of tho&s;e &s;ocie|ties.
Some of the greate&s;t &s;cholars, politicians,
and wits that ever Europe produced, have wore
the habit of an abb&eacute;; and many of our mo&s;t
noble families in England derive their honours
from tho&s;e who have &s;tudied law in the temple:
the worthy &s;ons of every community &s;hall al|ways
be &s;acred from my cen&s;ure and ridicule;
and while I laugh at the folly of particular mem|bers,
I can &s;till honour and revere the in&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>But, let us return from this compari&s;on, which
&s;ome readers may think impertinent and un&s;ea|&s;onable;
and ob&s;erve that the We&s;tphalian count,
Dutch officer, and Engli&s;h knight, were not
excepted from the particular regard and atten|tion
<PB N="140" REF="149">
of our adventurer: he pledged the German
in every bumper; flattered the Hollander with
complements upon the indu&s;try, wealth and po|licy
of the &s;even United Provinces; but he re|&s;erved
his chief battery for his own countryman,
on the &s;uppo&s;ition that he was, in all re&s;pects, the
be&s;t adapted for the purpo&s;es of a needy game|fter:
him, therefore, he cultivated with extra|ordinary
care, and &s;ingular ob&s;ervance; for he
&s;oon perceived him to be an humouri&s;t, and from
that circum&s;tance derived an happy pre&s;age of
his own &s;ucce&s;s. The baronet's di&s;po&s;ition &s;eem|ed
to be ca&s;t in the true Engli&s;h mould. He
was &s;our, &s;ilent and contemptuous; his very
looks indicated a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperior wealth,
and he never opened his mouth, except to make
&s;ome dry, &s;arca&s;tic, national reflection: nor
was his behaviour free from that air of &s;u&s;picion
which a man puts on, when he believes him&s;elf
in a croud of pickpockets whom his caution and
vigilance &s;et at de&s;iance: in a word, though his
tongue was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, his whole de|meanour
was continually &s;aying, &startq;You are all
a pack of poor, lou&s;y ra&s;cals, who have a de|&s;ign
upon my pur&s;e: 'tis true, I could buy your
whole generation; but, I wont be bubbled, d'ye
&s;ee; I am aware of your flattery, and upon
my guard again&s;t all your knavi&s;h pranks;
and I come into your company, for my own
amu&s;ement only.&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom having reconnoitred this peculiarity
of temper, in&s;tead of treating him with that a&s;&s;i|duous
complai&s;ance, which he received from the
other gentlemen of the party, kept aloof from
him in the conver&s;ation, with a remarkable &s;hy|ne&s;s
of di&s;tant civility, and &s;eldom took notice
<PB N="141" REF="150">
of what he &s;aid, except with a view to contra|dict
him, or retort &s;ome of his &s;atyrical ob&s;er|vations.
This he conceived to be the be&s;t me|thod
of acquiring his good opinion; becau&s;e the
Engli&s;hman would naturally conclude he was a
per&s;on who could have no &s;ini&s;ter views upon his
fortune, el&s;e he would have cho&s;en quite a dif|ferent
manner of deportment. Accordingly,
the knight &s;eemed to bite at the hook: he li&s;ten|ed
to Ferdinand with uncommon regard; he
was even heard to commend his remarks; and
at length drank to their better acquaintance.</P>

<P>THE Italian and the Abb&eacute; were the fir&s;t
who began to grow whim&s;ical under the
influence of the Burgundy; and in the heat of
their elevation, propo&s;ed that the company &s;hould
amu&s;e them&s;elves during the remaining part of
the night, at the hou&s;e of an obliging dame,
who maintained a troop of fair nymphs, for the
accommodation of the other &s;ex. The propo|&s;al
was approved by all, except the Hollander,
who&s;e oeconomy the wine had not as yet invad|ed;
and while he retreated &s;oberly to his own
lodgings, the re&s;t of the &s;ociety adjourned in
two coaches, to the temple of love, where they
were received by the venerable prie&s;te&s;s, a per|&s;onage
turned of &s;eventy, who &s;eemed to exer|ci&s;e
the functions of her calling, in de&s;pight of
the mo&s;t cruel ravages of time: for age had
bent her into the form of a Turki&s;h bow: her
head was agitated by the pal&s;y, like the leaf of
<PB N="142" REF="151">
the poplar-tree, her hair fell down in &s;canty par|cels,
as white as the driven &s;now: her face was
not &s;imply wrinkled, but ploughed into innume|rable
furrows: her jaws could not boa&s;t of one
remaining tooth; one eye di&s;tilled a large quan|tity
of rheum, by virtue of the fiery edge that
&s;urrounded it, the other was altogether extin|gui&s;hed,
and &s;he had lo&s;t her no&s;e in the cour&s;e
of her mini&s;tration. The Delphic &s;ibyl was but
a type of this hoary matron, who by her figure
might have been mi&s;taken for the con&s;ort of chaos,
or mother of time. Yet there was &s;omething
meritorous in her appearance, as it denoted her
an indefatigable mini&s;ter to the plea&s;ure of man|kind;
and as it formed an agreeable contra&s;t
with the beauty and youth of the fair dam&s;els
that wantoned in her train. It re&s;embled tho&s;e
di&s;cords in mu&s;ick, which properly di&s;po&s;ed,
contribute to the harmony of the whole piece:
or tho&s;e horrible giants who in the world of ro|mance,
u&s;ed to guard the gates of the ca&s;tle, in
which the inchanted dam&s;el was confined.</P>
<P>This Urganda &s;eemed to be aware of her own
importance, and perfectly well acquainted with
the human appetite; for &s;he compelled the
whole company to undergo her embrace; then a
lacquey in magnificent livery, u&s;hered them into
a &s;uperb apartment, where they waited &s;ome mi|nutes,
without being favoured with the appear|ance
of the ladies, to the manife&s;t di&s;&s;atisfaction
of the abb&eacute;, who &s;ending for the gouvernante,
reprimanded her &s;everely for her want of poli|te&s;&s;e.
The old lady, who was by no means a
patern of patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, retorted his
reproaches with great empha&s;is and vivacity:
her eloquence flowed altogether in the Covent|garden
<PB N="143" REF="152">
&s;train; and I que&s;tion whether the cele|brated
mother D&mdash;gl&mdash;s her&s;elf could have made
&s;uch a figure in extemporaneous altercation.</P>
<P>After having be&s;towed upon the abb&eacute; the epi|thets
of &s;aucy in&s;ignificant pimp, &s;he put him in
mind of the good offices which he had received
at her hands; how &s;he had &s;upplied him with
bed, board, and bedfellow, in his greate&s;t
nece&s;&s;ity; &s;ent him abroad with money in his
pockets, and in a word, cheri&s;hed him in her
bo&s;om, when his own mother had abandoned
him to di&s;tre&s;s: &s;he then reviled him for pre|&s;uming
to affront her before &s;trangers, and gave
the company to under&s;tand that the young ladies
would wait upon them, as &s;oon as they could
be confe&s;&s;ed and receive ab&s;olution from a wor|thy
cordelier, who was now employed in per|forming
that charitable office. The gentlemen
were &s;atisfied with this remon&s;trance, which ar|gued
the old lady's pious concern for the &s;ouls
that were under her care, and our adventurer
propo&s;ed an accommodation betwixt her and the
abb&eacute;, who was prevailed upon to ask her pardon,
and received her ble&s;&s;ing upon his knees.</P>
<P>This affair had not been long adju&s;ted, when
five dam&s;els were introduced in a very gay di&s;ha|bille,
and our hero was complimented with the
privilege of chu&s;ing his Amanda from the whole
bevy: when he was provided, the others began
to pair them&s;elves, and unhappily, the German
count chanced to pitch upon the &s;ame nymph
who had captivated the de&s;ires of the Briti&s;h
knight: a di&s;pute immediately en&s;ued, for the
Engli&s;hman made his addre&s;&s;es to the lady,
without paying the lea&s;t regard to the priority
of the other's claim; and &s;he being plea&s;ed with
<PB N="144" REF="153">
his attachment, did not &s;cruple to renounce his
rival, who &s;wore by the thunder, lightning and
&s;acrament, that he would not quit his preten|&s;ions
for any prince in Chri&s;tendom, much le&s;s
for a little Engli&s;h chevalier, whom he had al|ready
honoured too much in conde&s;cending to
be his companion.</P>
<P>The knight, provoked at this &s;tately declara|tion,
which was the immediate effect of anger
and ebriety, eyed his antagoni&s;t with a mo&s;t
contemptuous a&s;pect, and advi&s;ed him to avoid
&s;uch compari&s;ons for the future: &startq;We all know,
&s;aid he, the importance of a German count;
I &s;uppo&s;e your revenue amounts to three hundred
rixdollars; and you have a chateau that looks
like the ruins of an Engli&s;h gaol. I will bind
my&s;elf to lend you a thou&s;and pounds upon a
mortgage of your e&s;tate (and a bad bargain I am
&s;ure I &s;hould have:) if I do not in le&s;s than two
months, find a yeoman of Kent, who &s;pends
more in &s;trong ale, than the &s;um total of your
yearly income; and were the truth known, I be|lieve
that lace upon your coat, is no better than
tin&s;el, and tho&s;e fringed ruffles with fine Holland
&s;leeves, tacked to a &s;hirt of brown canvas, &s;o
that were you to undre&s;s your&s;elf before the lady,
you would only expo&s;e your own poverty and
pride.&endq;</P>
<P>The count was &s;o much enraged at the&s;e &s;ar|ca&s;tic
ob&s;ervations, that his faculty of &s;peech
was overwhelmed by his re&s;entment; though
in order to acquit him&s;elf of the Engli&s;h|man's
imputation, he forthwith pulled off his
cloaths with &s;uch fury, that his brocard wai&s;t|coat
was tore from top to bottom. The knight
mi&s;taking his meaning, con&s;idered this demeanour
<PB N="145" REF="154">
as a fair challenge, to try which was the better
man in the exerci&s;e of boxing; and on that &s;up|p$$$tion,
began to &s;trip in his turn, when he
was undeceived by Fathom, who put the right
interpretation upon the count's behaviour, and
begged that the affair might be compromi&s;ed.
By this time the We&s;tphalian recovered the u&s;e
of his tongue, and with many threats and impre|cations,
de&s;ired they would take notice how
fal&s;ly he had been a&s;per&s;ed, and do him ju&s;tice
in e&s;pou&s;ing his claim to the dam&s;el in que&s;|tion.</P>
<P>Before the company had time or inclination
to intere&s;t them&s;elves in the quarrel, his oppo|nent
ob&s;erved that no per&s;on who was not a meer
German, would ever dream of forcing the in|clinations
of a pretty girl, whom the accidents
of fortune had &s;ubjected to his power: that &s;uch
compul&s;ion was equivalent to the mo&s;t cruel rape
that could be committed; and that the lady's
aver&s;ion was not at all &s;urpri&s;ing; for, to &s;peak
his own &s;entiments, were he a woman of plea|&s;ure,
he would as &s;oon grant favours to a We&s;t|phalian
hog, as to the per&s;on of his antagoni&s;t.
The German enraged at this compari&s;on, was
quite abandoned by his patience and di&s;cretion:
he called the knight an Engli&s;h clown, and
&s;wearing he was the mo&s;t untoward bea&s;t of a
whole nation of mules, &s;natched up one of the
candle&s;ticks which he launched at him with
&s;uch force and violence, that it &s;ung through the
air, and winging its flight into the anti-chamber,
encountered the &s;kull of his own valet, who
with immediate pro&s;tration received the me&s;&s;age
of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="155">
The knight, that he might not be behind
hand with the We&s;tphalian, in point of court$&s;y,
returned the compliment with the remaining
chandelier, which al&s;o mi&s;&s;ed its mark, and
&s;miting a large mirrour that was fixed behind
them, emitted &s;uch a cra&s;h as one might expect
to hear if a mine were &s;prung beneath a manu|facture
of gla&s;s. Both lights being thus extin|gui&s;hed,
a &s;urious combat en&s;ued in the dark;
the Italian &s;campered off with infinite agility,
and as he went down &s;tairs, de&s;ired that nobody
would interpo&s;e, becau&s;e it was an affair of ho|nour,
which could not be made up. The ladies
con&s;ulted their fafety in flight; count Fathom
&s;lily retired to one corner of the room, while the
abb&eacute; having upon him the terrors of the commi&s;|&s;aire,
endeavoured to appea&s;e and part the com|batants,
and in the attempt, &s;u&s;tained a random
blow upon his no&s;e, which &s;ent him howling
into the other chamber, where finding his band
be&s;mea$ed with his own blood, he began to
caper about the apartment, in a tran&s;port of rage
and vexation.</P>
<P>Mean while, the old gentlewoman being
alarmed with the noi&s;e of the battle, and ap|prehen&s;ive
that it would end in murder, to the
danger and di&s;credit of her&s;elf and family, im|mediately
mu&s;tered up her myrmidons, of whom
&s;he always retained a formidable band, and put|ing
her&s;elf at their head, lighted them to the
&s;cene of uproar: Ferdinand, who had hitherto
ob&s;erved a &s;trict neutrality, no &s;ooner perceived
them approach, than he leaped in between the
di&s;putants, that he might be &s;ound acting in the
character of a peace-maker; and indeed, by this
time, victory had declared for the baronet, who
had treated his antagoni&s;t with a cro&s;s-buttock,
<PB N="147" REF="156">
which laid him almo&s;t breathle&s;s on the floor.
The victor was prevailed upon, by the intreaties
of Fathom, to quit the field of battle, and ad|journ
into another room, where in le&s;s than half
an hour, he received a billet from the count,
defying him to &s;ingle combat on the frontiers
of Flanders, at an appointed time and place.
The challenge was immediately accepted by the
knight, who being flu&s;hed with conque&s;t, treat|ed
his adver&s;ary with great contempt.</P>
<P>But, next day, when the fumes of the Bur|gundy
were quite exhaled, and the adventure
recurred to his remembrance and &s;ober reflection,
he waited upon our adventurer at his lodgings,
and &s;ollicited his advice in &s;uch a manner, as
gave him to under&s;tand that he looked upon
what had happened, as a drunken brawl, which
ought to have no &s;erious con&s;equences. Fathom
fore&s;eeing that the affair might be managed for
his own intere&s;t, profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the baro|net's
opinion; and without he&s;itation, under|took
the office of a mediator, a&s;&s;uring his prin|cipal,
that his honour &s;hould &s;uffer no &s;tain in
the cour&s;e of his negotiation.</P>
<P>Having received the Engli&s;hman's acknow|ledgments
for this in&s;tance of friend&s;hip, he
forthwith &s;et out for the place of the Ger|man's
habitation, and under&s;tanding he was &s;till
a&s;leep, in&s;i&s;ted upon his being immediately
waked, and told, that a gentleman from the che|valier,
de&s;ired to &s;ee him, upon bu&s;ine&s;s of im|portance
which could not be delayed. Accord|ingly,
his valet de chambre pre&s;&s;ed by Fathom's
importunities and remon&s;trances, ventured to go
in and &s;hake the count by the &s;houlder, when
this furious Teutonian, &s;till agitated by the fever
<PB N="148" REF="157">
of the preceding night, leaped out of bed in a
frenzy, and &s;eizing his &s;word that lay upon a ta|ble,
would have &s;everely puni&s;hed the pre&s;ump|tion
of his &s;ervant, had not he been re&s;trained
by the entrance of Ferdinand, who with a pe|remptory
countenance, gave him to under&s;tand
that the valet had acted at his immediate in&s;tiga|tion;
and that he was come, as the Engli&s;hman's
friend, to concert with him proper mea&s;ures for
keeping the appointment they had made at their
la&s;t meeting.</P>
<P>This me&s;&s;age effectually calmed the German,
who was not a little mortified to find him&s;elf &s;o
di&s;agreeably di&s;turbed. He could not help cur&s;|ing
the impatience of his antagoni&s;t, and even
hinting that he would have acted more like a
gentleman and good chri&s;tian, in expre&s;&s;ing a
de&s;ire of &s;eeing the affair accommodated, as he
knew him&s;elf to be the aggre&s;&s;or, con&s;equently
the fir&s;t offender again&s;t the laws of politene&s;s
and good fellow&s;hip. Fathom finding him in a
fit temper of mind, took the opportunity of a&s;|&s;enting
to the rea&s;onablene&s;s of his ob&s;ervation:
he ventured to condemn the impetuo&s;ity of the
baronet, who, he perceived, was extremely
nice and &s;crupulous in the punctilios of honour;
and &s;aid it was pity that two gentlemen &s;hould
forfeit each other's friend&s;hip, much le&s;s expo&s;e
their lives for &s;uch a frivolous cau&s;e. &startq;My dear
count! cried the We&s;tphalian, I am charmed
to find your &s;entiments &s;o conformable to my
own: in an honourable cau&s;e, I de&s;pi&s;e all dan|ger;
my courage, thank Heaven! has been
manife&s;ted in many public engagements as well
as in private rencounters; but, to break with
my friend, who&s;e eminent virtues I admire, and
<PB N="149" REF="158">
even to &s;eek his life, on &s;uch a &s;candalous occa|&s;ion,
for a little in&s;ignificant whore, who, I &s;up|po&s;e,
took the advantage of our intoxication, to
foment the quarrel: by Heaven! my con&s;cience
cannot dige&s;t it.&endq;</P>
<P>Having expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to this purpo&s;e, he
waited impatiently for the reply of Ferdinand,
who after a pau&s;e of deliberation, offered his
&s;ervices in the way of mediation; though he ob|&s;erved,
it was a matter of great delicacy,
and the event altogether uncertain. &startq;Never|thele&s;s,&endq;
added our adventurer, &startq;I will &s;trive
to appea&s;e the knight, who, I hope will be in|duced
by my remon&s;trances to forget the unlucky
accident, which hath &s;o di&s;agreeably interrupted
your mutual friend&s;hip.&endq; The German thanked
him for this proof of his regard, which yielded
him more &s;atisfaction on account of the cheva|lier
than of him&s;elf: &startq;For, by the tombs of
my fathers!&endq; cried he, &startq;I have &s;o little concern
for my per&s;onal &s;afety, that if my honour were
intere&s;ted, I dur&s;t oppo&s;e my&s;elf &s;ingly to the
whole ban of the empire; and I am now ready,
if the chevalier requires it, to give him the ren|dezvous
in the fore&s;t of Senlis, either on hor&s;e|back
or on foot, where this conte&s;t may be ter|minated
with the life of one or both of us.&endq;</P>
<P>Count Fathom, with a view to cha&s;ti&s;e the
We&s;tphalian for this rhodomontade, told him
with a mortifying air of indifference, that if they
were both bent upon taking the field, he would
&s;ave him&s;elf the trouble of interpo&s;ing farther in
the affair; and de&s;ired to know the hour at
which it would &s;uit him to take the air with the
baronet: the other, not a little embarra&s;&s;ed by
this que&s;tion, &s;aid with a faultering tongue, he
<PB N="150" REF="159">
&s;hould be proud to obey the chevalier's orders;
but, at the &s;ame time, owned he &s;hould be much
better plea&s;ed, if our hero would execute the
pacific propo&s;al he had made. Fathom, accord|ingly
promi&s;ed to exert him&s;elf for that purpo&s;e,
returned to the knight, with whom he a&s;&s;umed
the merit of having tranquillized the rage of an
incen&s;ed barbarian, who was now di&s;po&s;ed to a
reconciliation upon equal terms: the baronet
overwhelmed him with care&s;&s;es and compliments
upon his friend&s;hip and addre&s;s; the parties met
that &s;ame forenoon, as if by accident in Fathom's
apartment, where they embraced each other
cordially, exchanged apologies, and renewed
their former corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Our adventurer thought he had good rea&s;on
to congratulate him&s;elf upon the part he acted
in this pacification: he was treated by both with
&s;ignal marks of particular affection and e&s;teem.
The count pre&s;&s;ed him to accept as a token of his
attachment, a &s;word of very curious workman|&s;hip,
which he had received in a pre&s;ent from a
certain prince of the empire: the knight forced
upon his finger a very &s;plendid diamond ring, as a
te&s;timony of his gratitude and e&s;teem: but there
was &s;till another per&s;on to be appea&s;ed, before
the peace of the whole company could be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.
This was no other than the abb&eacute;, from
whom each of the reconciled friends received
at dinner a billet couched in the&s;e words.</P>
<P>&startq;I have the honour to lament the infinite
chagrin and mortification that compels me
to addre&s;s my&s;elf in this manner to a per|&s;on
of your rank and eminence, whom I
&s;hould do my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of waiting upon
<PB N="151" REF="160">
in per&s;on; were I not prevented by the mis|fortune
of my no&s;e, which was la&s;t night mo&s;t
cruelly di&s;ar$$$ged, by a violent contu&s;ion I
had the honour to receive, in attempting to
compo&s;e that unhappy <HI>fracas,</HI> at the hou&s;e of
madam la Maquerelle; and what puts the
fini&s;hing &s;troke to my mi&s;hap, is my being
rendered incapable of keeping three or four
a&s;&s;ignations with ladies of fa&s;hion, by whom I
have the honour to be particularly e&s;teemed.
The disfiguration of my no&s;e, the pain I have
undergone, with the di&s;compo&s;ure of brain
which it produced, I could bear as a philo&s;o|pher;
but the di&s;appointment of the ladies, my
glory will not permit me to overlook: and as
you know the injury was &s;u&s;tained in your &s;er|vice,
I have the plea&s;ure to hope you will not
refu&s;e to grant &s;uch reparation as will be ac|ceptable
to a gentleman who has the honour to
be with inviolable attachment,</P>
<Q>&startq;Sir your mo&s;t devoted &s;lave,
Pepin Clothaire Charl&eacute; Henri Louis Bar|nabe
de Eumier.&endq;</Q>
<P>This epi&s;tle was &s;o equivocal, that the per|&s;ons
to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, did not know
whether or not they ought to interpret the con|tents
into a challenge; when our hero ob&s;erved,
that the ambiguity of his expre&s;&s;ions, plainly
proved there was a door left open for accom|modation;
and propo&s;ed that they &s;hould forth|with
vi&s;it the writer at his own apartment: they
accordingly followed his advice, and found the
abb&eacute; in his morning-gown and &s;lippers, with
three huge night-caps on his head, and a crape
<PB N="152" REF="161">
hat-band tied over the middle of his face, by
way of bandage to his no&s;e. He received his
vi&s;iters with the mo&s;t ridiculous &s;olemnity, be|ing
&s;till a &s;tranger to the purport of their errand;
but &s;oon as the We&s;tphalian declared they were
come in con&s;equence of his billet, in order to
a&s;k pardon for the unde&s;igned offence they had
given, his features retrieved their natural viva|city,
and he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf perfectly &s;atisfied
with their polite acknowledgment. Then they
condoled him upon the evil plight of his no&s;e,
and &s;eeing &s;ome marks upon his &s;hirt, a&s;ked with
&s;eeming concern, if he had lo&s;t any blood in the
fray. To this interrogation, he replied, that he
had &s;till a &s;ufficient quantity left for the occa&s;ions
of his friends; and that he &s;hould deem it his
greate&s;t glory, to expend the la&s;t drop of it in
their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Matters being thus amicably adju&s;ted, they
prevailed upon him to unca&s;e his no&s;e, which
retained no &s;igns of the outrage he had &s;uffered;
and the amu&s;ements of the day were concerted.
It was in con&s;equence of this plan, that after the
comedy, they were entertained at the count's
lodgings, where quadrille was propo&s;ed by the
abb&eacute;, as the mo&s;t innocent pa&s;time, and the
propo&s;al was immediately embraced by all pre|&s;ent,
and by none with more alacrity than by
our adventurer, who without putting forth a
moiety of his terror, went home with twenty
louis' clear gain: though, far from believing
him&s;elf greatly &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the party,
in the artifices of play, he ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected that
they had concealed their &s;kill, with a view of
&s;tripping him on &s;ome other occa&s;ion; for he
could not &s;uppo&s;e, that per&s;ons of their figure
<PB N="153" REF="162">
and character, &s;hould be, in reality, &s;uch novices
as they affected to appear.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="24" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He overlooks the advances of his friends, and
&s;marts &s;everely for his neglect.</HEAD>
<P>STeeled with this cautious maxim he guarded
him&s;elf from their united endeavours, in
&s;undry &s;ub&s;equent attacks, by which his fir&s;t con|jecture
was confirmed, and &s;till came off con|queror,
by virtue of his unparallelled fine&s;&s;e and
di&s;cretion: till at length they &s;eemed to de&s;pair
of making him their prey, and the count began
to drop &s;ome hints, importing a de&s;ire of &s;eeing
him more clo&s;ely united to the views and intere&s;t
of their triumvirate. But Ferdinand, who was
altogether &s;elfi&s;h, and quite &s;olitary in his pro&s;|pects,
di&s;couraged all tho&s;e advances; being re|&s;olved
to trade upon his own bottom only, and
to avoid all &s;uch connexions with any per&s;on or
&s;ociety whatever; much more, with a &s;et of
raw adventurers who&s;e talents he de&s;pi&s;ed. With
the&s;e &s;entiments, he &s;till maintained the dignity
and re&s;erve of his fir&s;t appearance among them,
and rather inhanced than dimini&s;hed that idea of
importance which he had in&s;pired at the begin|ning;
becau&s;e be&s;ides his other qualifica|tions,
they gave him credit for the addre&s;s with
which he kept him&s;elf &s;uperior to their united
de&s;igns.</P>
<P>While he thus enjoyed his pre-heminence,
together with the fruits of his &s;ucce&s;s at play,
which he managed &s;o di&s;creetly, as never to in|cur
the reputation of an adventurer; he one day,
chanced to be at the ordinary, when the com|pany
<PB N="154" REF="163">
was &s;urpri&s;ed by the entrance of &s;uch a
figure as had never appeared before in that place.
This was no other than a per&s;on habited in the
exact uniform of an Engli&s;h jockey. His leathern
cap, cut bob, &s;u&s;tian frock, flannel wai&s;tcoat,
buff breeches, hunting-boots and whip, were
&s;ufficient of them&s;elves to furni&s;h out a phaeno|menon
for the admiration of all Paris: but the&s;e
peculiarities were rendered &s;till more con&s;picu|ous
by the behaviour of the man who owned
them. When he cro&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold of the
outward door, he produced &s;uch a found from
the &s;mack of his whip, as equalled the explo&s;ion
of an ordinary cohorn; and then broke forth
into the hollow of a foxhunter, which he
uttered with all its variations, in a &s;train of vo|ciferation,
that &s;eemed to a&s;toni&s;h and confound
the whole a&s;&s;embly, to whom he introduced
him&s;elf and his &s;paniel, by exclaiming in a tone
&s;omething le&s;s melodious than the cry of macka|rel
or live cod. &startq;By your leave, Gentlevolks,
I hope there's no offence, in an hone&s;t plain
Engli&s;hman's coming with money in his pocket,
to ta&s;te a bit of your Vrench friga&s;ee and ra|gooze.&endq;</P>
<P>This declaration was made in &s;uch a wild, fan|ta&s;tical
manner, that the greate&s;t part of the compa|ny
mi&s;took him for &s;ome &s;avage mon&s;ter or maniac,
and con&s;ulted their &s;afety by &s;tarting up from table,
and drawing their &s;words. The Engli&s;hman &s;ee|ing
&s;uch a martial apparatus produced again&s;t him,
recoiled two or three &s;teps, &s;aying, &startq;Waunds, a
believe the people are all bewitched: what do
they take me for a bea&s;t of prey; is there no
body here that knows Sir Stentor Stile, or can
&s;peak to me in my own lingo?&endq; He had no
<PB N="155" REF="164">
&s;ooner pronounced the&s;e words, than the baronet,
with marks of infinite &s;urprize, ran towards
him, crying, &startq;Good Heaven! Sir Stentor,
who expected to meet with you in Paris?&endq; Up|on
which, the other eyeing him very earne&s;tly,
&startq;Odds heartlikens, cried he, my neighbour Sir
Giles Squirrel, as I am a living &s;oul!&endq; With the&s;e
words, he flew upon him like a tyger, ki&s;&s;ed
him from ear to ear, demoli&s;hed his periwig, and
di&s;ordered the whole oeconomy of his dre&s;s, to
the no &s;mall entertainment of the company.</P>
<P>Having well nigh &s;tifled his countryman with
embraces, and be&s;meared him&s;elf with pulville
from head to foot, he proceeded in this manner;
&startq;Mercy upon thee, knight, thou art &s;o tran&s;|m$graphied
and bedaubed, and bedizened, that
thou mought rob thy own mother without fear of
information. Look ye here now, I will be tru&s;s|ed,
if the very bitch that was brought up in thy
own bo&s;om, knows thee again. Hey, &s;weetlips,
here hu&s;&s;y, damn thee tuoad, do'&s;t n't know thy
old mea&s;ter. Ey, ey, thou may'&s;t &s;mell till
Chri&s;tmas. I'll be bound to be hanged, knight,
if the creature's no&s;e an't foundered by the
damned &s;tinking per&s;umes you have got among
you.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e compliments being pa&s;t, the two knights
&s;at down by one another, and Sir Stentor be|ing
a&s;ked by his neighbour, upon what errand
he had cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, gave him to under&s;tand,
that he had come to Franc$, in con&s;equence of
a wager with &s;quire Snaffle, who had laid a
thou&s;and pounds, that he, Sir Stentor, would
not travel to Paris by him&s;elf, and for a whole
month, appear every day at a certain hour, in
the public walks, without wearing any other
<PB N="156" REF="165">
dre&s;s, than that in which he &s;aw him. &startq;The &s;el|lor
has got no more &s;tuff in his pate, continued
this polite &s;tranger, than a jack-a&s;s, to think I
could not find my way hither, thof I could not
jabber your French lingo. Ecod! the people of
this country, are &s;harp enough to find out your
meaning, when you want to &s;pend any thing
among them: and as for the matter of dre&s;s, bo|dikins!
for a thou&s;and pounds, I would engage
to live in the mid&s;t of them, and &s;hew my&s;elf
without any cloaths at all. Odd's heart! a
true-born Engli&s;hman needs not be afeard to
&s;hew his face, nor his back-&s;ide neither, with
the be&s;t Frenchman, that ever trod the ground.
Tho&s; we Engli&s;hmen don't beplai&s;ter our dou|blets
with gold and &s;ilver, I believe as how we
have our pockets better lined than mo&s;t of our
neighbours; and for all my bit of a &s;u&s;tian
frock, that co&s;t me in all but forty &s;hillings, I
believe, between you and me, knight, I have more
du&s;t in my fo$, than all the&s;e powdered &s;parks
put together. But the wor&s;t of the matter is
this; here is no &s;olid belly timber in this coun|try:
one can't have a &s;lice of a delicate &s;irloin,
or nice buttock of beef, for love nor money.
Apize upon them! I could get no eata$les
upon the ruoad, but what they call Bully, which
looks like the fle&s;h of Pharaoh's lean kine &s;tewed
into rags and tatters; and then their peajohn,
peajohn, rabbet them! one would think every
old woman of this kingdom hatched pidgeons
from her own body.&endq;</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch an original
&s;at unob&s;erved. The French and other foreigners,
who had never been in England, were &s;truck
dumb with amazement, at the knight's appear|ance
<PB N="157" REF="166">
and deportment; while the Engli&s;h gue&s;ts
were over whelmed with &s;hame and confu&s;ion,
and kept a mo&s;t wary &s;ilence, for fear of being
recognized by their countryman. As for our
adventurer, he was inwardly tran&s;ported with
joy at fight of this curio&s;ity. He con&s;idered
him as a genuine, rich country booby, of the
right Engli&s;h growth, fre&s;h as imported; and
his heart throbbed with rapture, when he heard
Sir Stentor value him&s;elf upon the lining of his
pockets: he fore&s;aw, indeed, that the other
knight would endeavour to re&s;erve him for his
own game; but he was too con&s;cious of his own
accompli&s;hments to think he &s;hould find great
difficulty in &s;uper&s;eding the influence of Sir Giles.</P>
<P>Mean while, the new comer was by his friend,
helped to &s;ome ragout, which plea&s;ed his palate,
&s;o well, that he declared he &s;hould now m$ke a
hearty meal, for the fir&s;t time, &s;ince he had
cro&s;&s;ed the water; and while his good humour
prevailed, he drank to every individual around
the table. Ferdinand &s;eized this opportunity of
in&s;inuating him&s;elf into his favour, by &s;aying in
Engli&s;h, he was glad to find there was any thing
in France, that was agreeable to Sir Stentor:
to this compliment the knight replied with an
air of &s;urprize. &startq;Waunds! I find here's ano|ther
countryman of mine, in this here com|pany.
Sir, I am proud to &s;ee you with all my
heart.&endq; So &s;peaking, he thru&s;t out his right
hand, acro&s;s the table, and &s;hook our hero by
the fi&s;t, with &s;uch violence of civility, as proved
very grievous to a French marquis, who, in
helping him&s;elf to &s;oup, was jo$tled in &s;uch a
manner, as to overturn the dividing &s;poon in his
own bo&s;om. The Engli&s;hman &s;eeing the mi&s;|chief
<PB N="158" REF="167">
chief he had produced, cried, &startq;no offence, I
hope,&endq; in a tone of vociferation, which the
marquis in all probability mi&s;con&s;trued: for he
began to model his features into a very &s;ub|lime
and peremptory look, when Fathom inter|preted
the apology, and at the &s;ame time, in|formed
Sir Stentor, that although he him&s;elf had
not the honour of being an Engli&s;hman, he had
always entertained a mo&s;t particular veneration
for the country, and learned the language in con|&s;equence
of that e&s;teem.</P>
<P>&startq;Blood!&endq; an&s;wered the knight, &startq;I think my|&s;elf
the more obliged to you for your kind opi|nion,
than if you was my countryman in good
earne&s;t: for there be abundance of we Engli&s;h,
no offence Sir Giles, that &s;eem to be a&s;hamed
of their own nation, and leave their homes to
come and &s;pend their fortunes abroad, among a
parcel of&mdash;you under&s;tand me, Sir&mdash;a word to
the wi&s;e, as the &s;aying is&mdash;&endq; Here he was inter|rupted
by an article of the &s;econd cour&s;e, that
&s;eemed to give him great di&s;turbance: this was
a roa&s;ted leveret very &s;trong of the fumet, which
happened to be placed directly under his no&s;e,
his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling was no &s;ooner encountered
by the effluvia of this delicious fare, than he
&s;tarted up from table, exclaiming.&endq; Odd's my
liver! here's a piece of carrion, that I would
not offer to e'er a hound in my kennel; 'tis
enough to make any chri&s;tian vomit both gut
and gall;&endq; and indeed, by the wry faces he
made while he ran to the door, his &s;tomach
&s;eemed ready to ju&s;tify this la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The abb&eacute;, who concluded from the&s;e &s;ymp|toms
of di&s;gu&s;t, that the leveret was not &s;uffi|ciently
&s;tale, began to exhibit marks of di&s;con|tent,
<PB N="159" REF="168">
and de&s;ired that it might be brought to
the other end of the table, for his examination.
He accordingly hung over it with the mo&s;t greedy
appetite, fea&s;ting his no&s;trils with the &s;teams of
animal putrefaction; and at length declared that
the morceau was pa&s;&s;able, though he owned it
would have been highly perfect, had it been kept
another week. Neverthele&s;s, mouths were not
wanting to di&s;cu&s;s it, in&s;ipid as it was: for in
three minutes there was not a ve&s;tige to be &s;een
of that which had offended the organs of Sir
Stentor, who now re&s;umed his place, and did
ju&s;tice to the de&s;ert. But what he &s;eemed to
reli&s;h better than any other part of the enter|tainment,
was the conver&s;ation of our adven|turer,
whom after dinner, he begged to have the
honour of treating with a di&s;h of coffee; to the
&s;eeming mortification of his brother knight, over
which Fathom exulted in his own heart.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, our hero, by his affability and en|gaging
deportment, immediately gained po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of Sir Stentor's good graces: in&s;omuch,
that he de&s;ired to crack a bottle with him in
the evening, and they repaired to an auberge,
whither his fellow knight accompanied them,
not without manife&s;t &s;igns of reluctance. There
the &s;tranger gave a loo&s;e to jollity; though at
fir&s;t he damned the Burgundy as a poor, thin
liquor, that ran through him in a twinkling, and
in&s;tead of warming, cooled his heart and bowels:
however, it in&s;en&s;ibly &s;eemed to give the lie to
his imputation; for his &s;pirits ro&s;e to a more ele|vated
pitch of mirth and good fellow&s;hip; he
&s;ung or rather roared the Early Horn &s;o as to
alarm the whole neighbourhood, and began to
&s;labber his companions, with a mo&s;t bearlike af|fection,
<PB N="160" REF="169">
Yet, whatever ha&s;te he made to the
goal of ebriety, he was di&s;tanced by his brother
baronet, who from the beginning of the party
had made little other u&s;e of his mouth, than to
receive the gla&s;s, and now &s;unk down upon the
floor, in a &s;tate of temporary annihilation.</P>
<P>He was immediately carried to bed by the direc|tion
of Ferdinand, who now &s;aw him&s;elf in a man|ner
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of that mine, to which he had made
&s;uch eager and artful advances. That he might,
therefore, carry on the approaches in the &s;ame
cautious manner, he gradually &s;hook off the
trammels of &s;obriety, gave a loo&s;e to that &s;pirit
of freedom, which good liquor commonly in|&s;pires,
and in the familiarity of drunkenne&s;s,
owned him&s;elf head of a noble family of Poland,
from which he had been obliged to ab&s;ent him|&s;elf
on account of an affair of honour, not yet
compromi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having made this confe&s;&s;ion, and laid &s;trong
injunctions of &s;ecre&s;y upon Sir Stentor, his coun|tenance
&s;eemed to acquire from every &s;ucceed|ing
gla&s;s, a new &s;ymptom of intoxication: they
renewed their embraces, &s;wore eternal friend|&s;hip
from that day, and &s;wallowed fre&s;h bum|pers,
till both being in all appearance, quite
over-powered, they began to yawn in concert,
and even nod in their chairs. The knight
&s;eemed to re&s;ent the attacks of &s;lumber, as &s;o
many impertinent attempts to interrupt their
entertainment; he cur&s;ed his own propen&s;$y to
&s;leep, imputing it to the damned French climate,
and propo&s;ed to engage in &s;ome pa&s;time that
would keep them awake. &startq;Odd's fle&s;h! cried
the Briton, when I'm at home, I defy all the
devils in hell to fa&s;ten my eye-lids together, if
<PB N="161" REF="170">
&s;o be as I am otherwi&s;e inclined. For there's
mother and &s;i&s;ter Nan, and brother Numps,
and I continue to divert our&s;elves at all fours,
brag, cribbidge, tetotum, hu&s;le-cap, and chuck-varthing;
and tho'f I &s;ay it, that &s;hould n't &s;ay
it, I won't turn my back to e'er a he in Eng|land,
at any of the&s;e pa&s;times: and &s;o count, if
you are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, I am your man, that is in
the way of friend&s;hip, at which of the&s;e you
&s;hall plea&s;e to pitch upon.&endq;</P>
<P>To this propo&s;al Fathom replied, he was
quite ignorant of all the games he had mention|ed;
but, in order to amu&s;e Sir Stentor, he would
play with him at lan&s;quenet, for a trifle, as he
had laid it down for a maxim, to ri&s;k nothing
con&s;iderable at play. &startq;Waunds, an&s;wered the
knight, I hope you don't think I come here in
que&s;t of money. Thank God! I have a good
landed e&s;tate worth five thou&s;and a year, and
owe no man a halfpenny; and I que&s;tion whe|ther
there be many counts in your nation, no
offence, I hope, that can &s;ay a bolder word. As
for your lamb&s;kin net, I know nothing of the
matter: but I will to&s;s up with you for a guinea,
cro&s;s or pile as the &s;aying is, or if there's &s;uch a
thing in this country as a box and dice, I love to
hear the bones rattle &s;ometimes.&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom found &s;ome difficulty in concealing
his joy, at the mention of this la&s;t amu&s;ement,
which had been one of his chief &s;tudies, and in
which he had made &s;uch progre&s;s, that he could
calculate all the chances with the utmo&s;t exact|ne&s;s
and certainty. However, he made &s;hift
to contain him&s;elf, within due bounds, and with
&s;eeming indifference, con&s;ented to pa&s;s away an
hour at hazard, provided the implements could
<PB N="162" REF="171">
be procured. Accordingly, the landlord was
con&s;ulted, and their de&s;ire gratified; the dice
were produced, and the table re&s;ounded with
the effects of their mutual eagerne&s;s. Fortune,
at fir&s;t, declared for the Engli&s;hman, who was
permitted by our advent$rer to win twenty
broad pieces; and he was &s;o elated with his &s;uc|ce&s;s,
as to accompany every lucky throw with a
loud bur&s;t of laughter, and other &s;avage and
&s;imple mani&s;e&s;tations of exce&s;&s;ive joy, exclaim|ing
in a tone &s;omething le&s;s &s;weet than the bel|lowing
of a bull; &startq;Now for the main, count,
&mdash;odd! here they come&mdash;here are the &s;even black
&s;tars, i'faith. Come along my yellow-boys&mdash;
odd's heart! I never liked the face of Lewis
before.&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom drew happy pre&s;ages from the&s;e boyi&s;h
raptures, and after having indulged them for
&s;ome time, began to avail him&s;elf of his arith|metic,
in con&s;equence of which the knight was
obliged to refund the greate&s;t part of his winning:
then he altered his note, and became as in|temperate
in his chagrin, as he had been be|fore
immoderate in his mirth. He cur&s;ed him|&s;elf
and his whole generation, damned his bad
luck, &s;tamped with his feet, upon the floor, and
challenged Ferdinand to double &s;takes. This
was a very welcome propo&s;al to our hero, who
found Sir Stentor, ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;ubject as he had
long de&s;ired to encounter with; the more the
Engli&s;hman laid, the more he lo&s;t, and Fathom
took care to inflame his pa&s;&s;ions, by certain well-timed
&s;arca&s;ms upon his want of judgment, 'till
at length, he became quite outrageous, &s;wore
the dice were fal&s;e, and threw them out at the
window; pulled off his periwig, and committed
<PB N="163" REF="172">
it to the flames, &s;poke with the mo&s;t rancor|ous
contempt of his adver&s;ary's &s;kill, in&s;i&s;ting up|on
his having &s;tripped many a better man, for
all he was a count, and threatning that before
they parted, he &s;hould not only look like a Pole,
but al&s;o &s;mell like a pole-cat.</P>
<P>This was a &s;pirit which our adventurer in|du&s;triou&s;ly
kept up, ob&s;erving that the Engli&s;h
were dupes to all the world; and that in point
of genius and addre&s;s, they were no more than
noi&s;y braggadocios. In &s;hort, another pair of
dice was procured; the &s;takes were again rai&s;ed,
and after &s;everal vici&s;&s;itudes, fortune declared &s;o
much in favour of the knight, that Fathom lo&s;t
all the money in his pocket, amounting to a
pretty con&s;iderable &s;um. By this time, he was
warmed into uncommon eagerne&s;s and impati|ence;
being equally piqued at the &s;ucce&s;s and
provoking exultations of his antagoni&s;t, whom
he now invited to his lodgings, in order to de|cide
the conte&s;t: Sir Stentor complied with his
reque&s;t; the di&s;pute was renewed with various
&s;ucce&s;s, till towards day-light, Ferdinand &s;aw
this noi&s;y, raw, unexperienced &s;impleton, carry
off all his ready ca&s;h, together with his jewels,
and almo&s;t every thing that was valuable about
his per&s;on; and to crown the whole, the victor
at parting, told him with a mo&s;t intolerable
&s;neer, that &s;o &s;oon as the count &s;hould receive
another remittance from Poland, he would give
him his revenge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He bears his fate like a philo&s;opher; and contracts
acquaintance with a very remarkable per&s;onage.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was a proper &s;ubject for our hero to
moralize upon; and accordingly, it did
not pa&s;s without his remarks; he found him&s;elf
fairly foiled at his own weapons, reduced to in|digence
in a foreign land, and, what he chiefly
regretted, robbed of all tho&s;e gay expectations
he had indulged from his own &s;uppo&s;ed excel|lence
in the wiles of fraud: for, upon a little
recollection, he plainly perceived he had fallen a
&s;acrifice to the confederacy he had refu&s;ed to join;
and did not at all doubt that the dice were loaded
for his de&s;truction: but in&s;tead of beating his
head again&s;t the wall, tearing his hair, impre|cating
vain cur&s;es upon him&s;elf, or betraying
other frantic &s;ymptoms of de&s;pair, he re&s;olved
to accommodate him&s;elf to his fate, and profit
by the le&s;&s;on he had &s;o dearly bought.</P>
<P>With this intention, he immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
his valet, quitted his lodgings, retired to an ob|&s;cure
&s;treet, on the other &s;ide of the river, and
covering one eye with a large patch of black
&s;ilk, pre&s;ented him&s;elf in quality of a mu&s;ician,
to the director of the opera, who upon hearing
a trial of his &s;kill, received him into the band,
without further que&s;tion. While he continued
in this &s;ituation, he not only improved his ta&s;te
and execution in mu&s;ick, but likewi&s;e found
frequent opportunities to extend his knowledge of
mankind; for, be&s;ides the employment he exer|ci&s;ed
in public, he was often concerned in pri|vate
<PB N="165" REF="174">
concerts that were given in the hotels of
noblemen; by which means, he became more
and more acquainted with the per&s;ons, manners
and characters of high life, which he contem|plated
with the mo&s;t indu&s;trious attention, as a
&s;pectator, who being altogether unconcerned in
the performance, is at more liberty to ob|&s;erve
and enjoy the particulars of the entertain|ment.</P>
<P>It was in one of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, he had the
plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his friend Sir Stentor, dre&s;&s;ed
in the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable manner, and behaving
with all the over&s;trained polite&s;&s;e of a native
Frenchman: he was accompanied by his brother
knight and the abb&eacute;, and this triumvirate, even
in Fathom's hearing, gave a mo&s;t ludicrous detail
of the fine&s;&s;e they had practi&s;ed upon the Po|li&s;h
count, to their entertainer, who was amba&s;|&s;ador
from a certain court, and made him&s;elf
extremely merry with the particulars of the re|lation.
Indeed, they made &s;hift to de&s;cribe &s;ome
of the circum&s;tances in &s;uch a ridiculous light,
that our adventurer him&s;elf, &s;marting as he was
with the di&s;grace, could not help laughing in
&s;ecret at the account. He afterwards made it
his bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire into the characters of the
two Briti&s;h knights, and under&s;tood they were
notorious &s;harpers, who had come abroad for the
good of their country, and now hunted in cou|ple
among a French pack, that di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves
through the public ordinaries, walks, and
&s;pectacles, in order to make a prey of incautious
&s;trangers.</P>
<P>The pride of Ferdinand was piqued at this
information; and he was even animated with
the de&s;ire of making repri&s;als upon this frater|nity,
<PB N="166" REF="175">
from which he ardently longed to retrieve
his honour and effects: but, the i&s;&s;ue of his la&s;t
adventure had reinforced his caution; and for
the pre&s;ent, he found means to &s;uppre&s;s the dic|tates
of his avarice and ambition; re&s;olving to
employ his whole penetration in reconnoitring
the ground, before he &s;hould venture to take
the field again. He therefore, continued to act
the part of a one-eyed fidler, under the name of
Fadini, and lived with incredible frugality, that
he might &s;ave a pur&s;e for his future operations.
In this manner had he proceeded for the &s;pace
of ten months, during which, he acquired a
competent knowledge of the city of Paris, when
his curio&s;ity was attracted by certain peculiarities
in the appearance of a man, who lived in one
of the upper apartments belonging to the hou&s;e,
in which he him&s;elf had fixed his habitation.</P>
<P>This was a tall, thin, meagre figure, with a long
black beard, an aquiline no&s;e, a brown complexion,
and a mo&s;t piercing vivacity in his eyes: he &s;eem|ed
to be about the age of fifty, wore the Per&s;ian
habit, and there was a remarkable &s;everity in his
a&s;pect and demeanour. He and our adventurer had
been fellow-lodgers for &s;ome time, and, according
to the laudable cu&s;tom of the&s;e days, had hitherto
remained as much e&s;tranged to one another, as
if they had lived on oppo&s;ite fides of the globe;
but of late, the Per&s;ian &s;eemed to regard our
hero with particular attention; when they
chanced to meet on the &s;tair-ca&s;e, or el&s;ewhere,
he bowed to Ferdinand with great &s;olemnity,
and complimented him with the Pas: he even
proceeded in the cour&s;e of this communication,
to open his mouth, and &s;alute him with a good
morrow, and &s;ometimes made the common re|marks
<PB N="167" REF="176">
upon the weather. Fathom, who was
naturally complai&s;ant, did not di&s;courage the&s;e
advances: on the contrary, he behaved to
him with marks of particular re&s;pect, and one
day, de&s;ired the favour of his company to break|fa&s;t.</P>
<P>This invitation the &s;tranger declined with due
acknowledgment, on pretence of being out of
order; and in the mean time, our adventurer
bethought him&s;elf of que&s;tioning the landlord
concerning his outlandi&s;h gue&s;t. His curio&s;ity
was rather inflamed than &s;atisfied with the infor|mation
he could obtain from this quarter; for,
all he learned, was, that the Per&s;ian went by
the name of Ali Beker, and that he had lived in
the hou&s;e, for the &s;pace of four months, in a
mo&s;t &s;olitary and par&s;imonious manner, without
being vi&s;ited by one living &s;oul; that, for &s;ome|time
after his arrival, he had been often heard to
groan di&s;mally in the night, and even to exclaim
in an unknown language, as if he had laboured
under &s;ome grievous affliction; and though the
fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his grief had &s;ub&s;ided, it was
ea&s;y to perceive, he &s;till indulged a deep rooted
melancholy, for the tears were frequently ob|&s;erved
to trickle down his beard. The commi&s;|&s;aire
of the quarter, had at fir&s;t ordered this
Oriental to be watched in his out-goings, ac|cording
to the maxims of the French police;
but his life was found &s;o regular and inoffen&s;ive,
that this precaution was &s;oon &s;et a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Any man of humane &s;entiments, from the
knowledge of the&s;e particulars, would have been
prompted to offer his &s;ervices to the &s;orlorn
&s;tranger: but as our hero was devoid of all the&s;e
infirmities of human nature, it was nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="168" REF="177">
that other motives &s;hould produce the &s;ame ef|fect:
his curio&s;ity, therefore, joined with the
hopes of converting the confidence of Ali to his
own emolument, effectually impelled him to|wards
his acquaintance; and in a little time,
they began to reli&s;h the conver&s;ation of each
other: for, as the reader may have already
ob&s;erved, Fathom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the arts of in&s;i|nuation;
and had di&s;cernment enough to per|ceive
an air of dignity in the Per&s;ian, which the
humility of his circum&s;tances could not conceal.
He was, moreover, a man of good under&s;tand|ing,
not without a tincture of letters, perfectly
well-bred, though in a ceremonious &s;tile, extreme|ly
moral in his di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;crupulou&s;ly nice in
his notions of honour.</P>
<P>Our hero conformed him&s;elf in all re&s;pects,
to the other's opinions, and managed his di&s;cre|tion
&s;o as to pa&s;s upon him, for a gentleman re|duced
by misfortunes, to the exerci&s;e of an em|ployment
which was altogether un&s;uitable to his
birth and quality. He made earne&s;t and repeat|ed
tenders of his good offices to the &s;tranger,
and pre&s;&s;ed him to make u&s;e of his pur&s;e, with
&s;uch cordial per&s;everance, that at length Ali's
re&s;erve was overcome, and he conde&s;cended to
borrow of him a &s;mall &s;um, which, in all proba|bility,
&s;aved his life; for he had been driven to
the utmo&s;t extremity of want before he would
accept of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Fathom, having gradually &s;tole into his good
graces, began to take notice of many piteous
sighs that e&s;caped him, in the moments of their
intercour&s;e, and &s;eemed to denote an heart
fraught with woe; and on pretence of admi|ni&s;tring
con&s;olation and coun&s;el, begged leave to
<PB N="169" REF="178">
know the cau&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;s; ob&s;erving that
his mind would be di&s;burthened by &s;uch commu|nication,
and perhaps his grief alleviated by &s;ome
means which they might jointly concert, and
execute in his behalf.</P>
<P>Ali, thus &s;ollicited, would often &s;hake his
head with marks of extreme &s;orrow and de&s;pon|dence,
and while the tears gu&s;hed from his
eyes, declared that his di&s;tre&s;s was beyond the
power of any remedy but death, and that by
making our hero his confident, he &s;hould only
extend his unhappine&s;s to a friend, without feel|ing
the lea&s;t remi&s;&s;ion of his own torture. Not|with&s;tanding
the&s;e repeated declarations, Ferdi|nand,
who was well enough acquainted with the
mind of man, to know that &s;uch importunity
is &s;eldom or never di&s;agreeable, redoubled his
in&s;tances, together with his expre&s;&s;ions of &s;ym|pathy
and e&s;teem, until the &s;tranger was pre|vailed
upon to grati&s;y his curio&s;ity and benevo|lence.
Having therefore, &s;ecured the chamber|door,
one night, while all the re&s;t of the family
was a&s;leep, the unfortunate Hali di&s;clo&s;ed him|&s;elf
in the&s;e words.</P>

his name. My you'h was not &s;pent in inglori|ous
ca&s;e, neither did it wa&s;te unheeded in the
rolls of fame: before I had attained the age of
nineteen, I was twice wounded in battle; I
once fortunately recovered the &s;tandard of the
regiment to which I belonged, after it had been
seized by the enemy; and at another occa&s;ion
made &s;hift to &s;ave the life of my colonel when
he lay at the mercy of an enraged barbarian.</P>
<P>He that thinks I recapitulate the&s;e particulars,
out of o&s;tentation, does wrong to the unhappy
Don Diego de Zelos, who in having performed
the&s;e little acts of gallantry, thinks he has done
nothing, but &s;imply approved him&s;elf worthy of
being called a Ca&s;tilian. I mean only to do
ju&s;tice to my own character, and to make you
acquainted with one of the mo&s;t remarkable
incidents of my life. It was my fate, during
my third campaign, to command a troop of
hor&s;e in the regiment of Don Gonzales Orgullo,
between whom and my father a family-feud
had long been maintained with great enmity;
and that gentleman did not leave me without
<PB N="171" REF="180">
rea&s;on to believe he rejoiced at the opportunity
of exerci&s;ing his re&s;entment upon his adver&s;ary's
&s;on; for he with-held from me that countenance
which my fellow officers enjoyed, and found
means to &s;ubject me to divers mortifications, of
which I was not at liberty to complain. The&s;e
I bore in &s;ilence, for &s;ome time, as part of my
probation in the character of a &s;oldier; re&s;olved
neverthele&s;s, to employ my intere&s;t at court, for
a removal into another corps, and to take &s;ome
future opportunity of explaining my &s;entiments
to Don Gonzales, upon the inju&s;tice of his be|haviour.</P>
<P>While I animated my&s;elf with the&s;e &s;enti|ments,
again&s;t the di&s;couragements I underwent,
and the hard duty to which I was daily expo&s;ed,
it was our fate to be concerned in the battle of
Sarago&s;&s;a, where our regiment was &s;o &s;everely
handled by the Engli&s;h infantry, that it was
forced to give ground with the lo&s;s of one half
of its officers and men. Don Gonzales, who
acted as brigadier in another wing, being in|formed
of our &s;ate, and dreading the di&s;grace of
his corps, which had never turned back to the
enemy, put &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and riding acro&s;s
the field at full &s;peed, rallied our broken &s;qua|drons,
and led us back to the charge, with &s;uch
intrepidity of behaviour, as did not fail to in|&s;pire
us all with uncommon courage and alacrity:
for my own part, I thought my&s;elf doubly inte|re&s;ted,
to di&s;tingui&s;h my valour; not only on
account of my own glory, but likewi&s;e on the
&s;uppo&s;ition, that as I was acting under the eye
of Gonzales, my conduct would be narrowly
ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="181">
I therefore exerted my&s;elf with unu&s;ual vigour,
and as he began the attack with the remains of
my troop, fought clo&s;e by his &s;ide, during the
re&s;t of the engagement. I even acquired his
applau&s;e in the very heat of battle: when his
hat was &s;truck off, and his hor&s;e fell under him,
I accommodated and remounted him upon my
own, and having &s;eized for my own u&s;e, ano|ther
that belonged to a common trooper, attend|ed
this &s;tern commander as before, and &s;econded
him in all his repeated efforts: but it was impo&s;|&s;ible
to with&s;tand the numbers and impetuo&s;ity
of the foe, and Don Gonzales having had the
mortification to &s;ee his regiment cut in pieces,
and the greate&s;t part of the army routed, was
$ain to yield to the fortune of the day; yet he
retired as became a man of honour and a Ca&s;ti|lian:
that is, he marched off with great delibe|ration,
in the rear of the Spani&s;h troops, and
frequently faced about to check the pur&s;uit of the
enemy. Indeed, this exerci&s;e of his courage had
well nigh co&s;t him his life; for, in one of the&s;e
wheelings, he was left almo&s;t alone, and a &s;mall
party of the Portugue&s;e hor&s;e had actually cut
off our communication with the retreating forces
of Spain.</P>
<P>In this dilemma, we had no other chance for
&s;aving our lives and liberty, than that of opening
a pa&s;&s;age &s;word in hand; and this was what Gon|zales
in&s;tantly re&s;olved to attempt. We accord|ingly
recommended our &s;ouls to God, and charg|ing
the line abrea&s;t of another, bore down all
oppo&s;ition, and were in a fair way of accompli&s;h|ing
our retreat, without further danger; but the
gallant Orgullo, in cro&s;&s;ing a ditch, had the mi&s;|fortune
to be thrown from his hor&s;e, and was
<PB N="173" REF="182">
almo&s;t the &s;ame in&s;tant overtaken by one of the
Portugue&s;e dragoons, who&s;e &s;word was already
&s;u&s;pended over his head, as he lay half-&s;tunned
with his fall; when I rode up, di&s;charged a pi&s;|tol
in the russian's brain, and &s;eating my colonel
on his hor&s;e, had the good fortune to conduct
him to a place of &s;afety.</P>
<P>Here he was provided with &s;uch accommoda|tion
as his ca&s;e required: for, he had been
wounded in the battle, and dangerou&s;ly brui&s;ed
by his fall, and when all the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps
were taken towards his recovery, I de&s;ired to
know if he had any further commands for his
&s;ervice, being re&s;olved to join the army without
delay. I thought proper to communicate this
que&s;tion, by me&s;&s;age, becau&s;e he had not &s;poke
one word to me, during our retreat, notwith|&s;tanding
the good office he had received at my
hands; a re&s;erve which I attributed to his pride,
and re&s;ented accordingly. He no &s;ooner under|&s;tood
my intention, than he de&s;ired to &s;ee me
in his apartment, and as near as I can remember
&s;poke to this effect.</P>
<P>&startq;Were your father Don Alonzo alive, I
&s;hould now, in con&s;equence of your behaviour,
bani&s;h every &s;ugge&s;tion of re&s;entment, and &s;ol|licit
his friend&s;hip, with great &s;incerity. Yes,
Don Diego, your virtue hath triumphed over that
enmity I bore your hou&s;e, and I upbraid my&s;elf
with the ungenerous treatment you have &s;uffered
under my command. But it is not enough for
me to withdraw that rigour which it was un|ju&s;t
to exerci&s;e, and would be wicked to main|tain:
I mu&s;t likewi&s;e attone for the injuries you
have &s;u&s;tained, and make &s;ome &s;uitable acknow|ledgment
for that life which I have twice to|day
<PB N="174" REF="183">
owed to your valour and genero&s;ity. What|ever
intere&s;t I have at court, &s;hall be employed
in your behalf; and I have other de&s;igns in your
favour, which &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed in due &s;ea&s;on.
Mean while, I de&s;ire you will &s;till add one ob|ligation
to the debt which I have already in|curred,
and carry this billet, in per&s;on, to my
E&s;ti&s;ania, who from the news of this fatal
overthrow, mu&s;t be in de&s;pair upon my ac|count.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he pre&s;ented a letter, directed to his
lady, which I received in a tran&s;port of joy,
with expre&s;&s;ions &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, and
immediately &s;et out for his country-hou&s;e, which
happened to be about thirty leagues from the
&s;pot. This expedition was equally glorious and
intere&s;ting: for my thoughts upon the road were
engro&s;&s;ed by the hope of &s;eeing Don Orgullo's
daughter and heire&s;s Antonia, who was report|ed
to be a young lady of great beauty, and the
mo&s;t amiable accompli&s;hments. However ridi|culous
it may &s;eem, for a man to conceive a pa&s;|&s;ion
for an object which he hath never beheld,
certain it is, my &s;entiments were &s;o much pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by the fame of her qualifications, that
I mu&s;t have fallen a victim to her charms, had
they been much le&s;s powerful than they were.
Notwith&s;tanding the fatigues I had undergone
in the field, I clo&s;ed not an eye, until I arrived
at the gate of Gonzales, being determined to
precede the report of the battle, that madam
d'Org$llo might not be alarmed for the life of
her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I declared my errand, and was introduced into
a &s;aloon, where I had not waited above three
minutes, when my colonel's lady appeared, and
<PB N="175" REF="184">
in great confu&s;ion, received the letter, exclaiming.
&startq;Heaven grant that Don Gonzales be well!&endq;
In reading the contents, &s;he underwent a variety
of agitations; but when &s;he had peru&s;ed the whole,
her countenance regained its &s;e$enity, and re|garding
me with an air of ineffable complacency,
&startq;Don Diego,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;while I lament the
national calamity, in the defeat of our army, I at
the &s;ame time, feel the mo&s;t &s;incere plea&s;ure, in
&s;eeing you upon this occa&s;ion, and according to
the directions of my dear lord, bid you heartily
welcome to this hou&s;e, as his pre&s;erver and
friend. I was not unacquainted with your cha|racter,
before this la&s;t triumph of your virtue,
and have often prayed to Heaven, for &s;ome lucky
determination of that fatal quarrel, which raged
&s;o long between the family of Gonzales and your
father's hou&s;e. My prayers have been heard,
the long wi&s;hed-for reconciliation is now effected,
and I hope nothing will ever intervene, to di|&s;turb
this happy union.&endq;</P>
<P>To this polite and affectionate declaration, I
made &s;uch a reply, as became a young man,
who&s;e heart overflowed with joy and benevo|lence,
and de&s;ired to know how &s;oon her an|&s;wer
to my commander would be ready, that I
might gratify his impatience, with all po&s;&s;ible
di&s;patch. After having thanked me for this fre&s;h
proof of my attachment, &s;he begged I would retire
into a chamber, and repo&s;e my&s;elf from the un|common
fatigues I mu&s;t have undergone; but,
finding I per&s;i&s;ted in the re&s;olution of returning
to Don Gonzales, without allowing my&s;elf the
lea&s;t benefit of &s;leep, &s;he left me engaged in
conver&s;ation with an uncle of Don Gonzales,
<PB N="176" REF="185">
who lodged in the hou&s;e, and gave orders that a
collation &s;hould be prepared in another apart|ment,
while &s;he retired to her clo&s;et, and wrote
a letter to her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than an hour from my fir&s;t arrival, I
was introduced into a mo&s;t elegant dining-room,
where a magnificent entertainment was &s;erved
up, and where we were joined by Donna E&s;ti|&s;ania,
and her beautiful daughter the fair Anto|nia,
who advancing, with the mo&s;t amiable
&s;weetne&s;s, thanked me in very warm expre&s;&s;ions
of acknowledgment, for the genero&s;ity of my
conduct towards her father. I had been ravi&s;hed
with her fir&s;t appearance, which far exceeded
my imagination, and my faculties were &s;o di&s;|ordered
by this addre&s;s, that I an&s;wered her com|pliment
with the mo&s;t aukward confu&s;ion. But
this di&s;order did not turn to my prejudice in the
opinion of that lovely creature, who has often
told me in the &s;equel, that &s;he gave her&s;elf cre|dit
for that perplexity in my behaviour, and that
I never appeared more worthy of her regard and
affection, than at that juncture, when my dre&s;s
was di&s;compo&s;ed, and my whole per&s;on di&s;|figured
by the toils and duty of the preceding
day; for this very di&s;habille pre&s;ented it&s;elf to
her reflexion as the immediate effect of that
very merit by which I was intitled to her
e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Wretch that I am! to &s;urvive the lo&s;s of &s;uch
an excellent woman, endeared to my remem|brance
by the mo&s;t tender offices of wedlock,
happily exerci&s;ed for the &s;pace of five and twenty
years! Forgive the&s;e tears, they are not the drops
of weakne&s;s, but remor&s;e. Not to trouble you
with idle particulars, &s;uffice it to &s;ay, I was fa|voured
<PB N="177" REF="186">
with &s;uch marks of di&s;tinction, by ma|dam
d'Orgullo, that &s;he thought it incumbent
upon her to let me know, &s;he had not over|acted
her ho&s;pitality, and while we &s;at at table,
acco&s;ted me in the&s;e words: &startq;You will not
be &s;urpri&s;ed, Don Diego, at my expre&s;&s;ions of
regard, which I own are unu&s;ual from a Spani&s;h
lady to a young cavalier like you, when I com|municate
the contents of this letter from Don
Gonzales.&endq; So &s;aying, &s;he put the billet into
my hand, and I read the&s;e words, or words to
this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>&startq;Amiable E&s;tifania,</OPENER>
<P>You will under&s;tand, that I am as well
as a per&s;on can po&s;&s;ibly be, who hath this day
lived to &s;ee the army of his king defeated.
If you would know the particulars of this un|fortunate
action, your curio&s;ity will be grati|fied
by the bearer Don Diego de Zelos, to
who&s;e virtue and bravery I am twice indebt|ed
for my life. I therefore de&s;ire you will
receive him with that re&s;pect and gratitude,
which you &s;hall think due for &s;uch an obli|gation;
and in entertaining him, di&s;mi&s;s that
re&s;erve, which often di&s;graces the Spani&s;h
ho&s;pitality. In a word, let your own virtue
and beneficence conduct you upon this occa|&s;ion,
and let my Antonia's endeavours be
joined with your own, in doing honour to the
pre&s;erver of her father. Adieu.&endq;</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Such a te&s;timonial could not fail of being
very agreeable to a young &s;oldier, who by thi$
time, had begun to indulge the tran&s;porting hops
of being happy in the arms of the adorable Ane|tonia.
<PB N="178" REF="187">
I profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf extremely happy in
having met with an opportunity of acquiring
&s;uch a degree of my colonel's e&s;teem, entertain|ed
them with a detail of his per&s;onal prowe&s;s in
the battle, and an&s;wered all their que&s;tions with
that moderation which every man ought to pre|&s;erve
in &s;peaking of his own behaviour. Our
repa&s;t being ended, I took my leave of the la|dies,
and at parting received a letter from Donna
E&s;tifania to her hu&s;band, together with a ring of
great value, which &s;he begged I would accept,
as a token of her e&s;teem. Thus loaded with
honour and care&s;&s;es, I &s;et out on my return for
the quarters of Don Gonzales, who could &s;carce
credit his own eyes when I delivered his lady's
billet; for he thought it impo&s;&s;ible to perform
&s;uch a journey in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>When he had glanced over the paper, &startq;Don
Diego,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;by your &s;hort &s;tay, one
would imagine you had met with indifferent re|ception
at my hou&s;e: I hope E&s;tifania has not
been deficient in her duty.&endq; I an&s;wered this
que&s;tion, by a&s;&s;uring him, my entertainment
had been &s;o agreeable in all re&s;pects, that no|thing
but my duty to him, could have induced
me to give it up &s;o &s;oon. He then turned the
conver&s;ation upon Antonia, and hinted his inten|tion
of giving her in marriage to a young cava|lier,
for whom he had a particular friend&s;hip. I
was &s;o much affected by this in&s;inuation, which
&s;eemed at once to bla&s;t all my hopes of love and
happine&s;s, that the blood for&s;ook my face; I
was &s;eized with an univer&s;al trepidation, and
even obliged to retire, on pretence of being &s;ud|denly
taken ill.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="188">
Though Gonzales &s;eemed to impute this di&s;|order
to fatigue and want of re&s;t, he in his heart
a&s;cribed it to the true cau&s;e, and after having
sounded my &s;entiments to his own &s;atisfaction, ble&s;|&s;ed
me with a declaration, importing that I was the
per&s;on upon whom he had pitched for a &s;on-in-law.
I will not trouble you with a repeti|tion
of what pa&s;&s;ed on this intere&s;ting occa&s;ion,
but proceed to ob&s;erve, that his intention in my
favour was far from being di&s;agreeable to his
lady; and that, in a little time, I had the good
fortune to e&s;pou&s;e the charming Antonia, who
&s;ubmitted to the will of her father without re|luctance.</P>
<P>Soon after this happy event, I was, by the in|fluence
of Don Gonzales, joined to my own in|tere&s;t,
promoted to the command of a regiment,
and &s;erved with honour during the remaining
part of the war. After the treaty of Utrecht,
I was employed in reducing the Catalans to their
allegiance, and in an action with the&s;e ob&s;tinate
rebels, had the misfortune to lo&s;e my father-in-law,
who by that time was preferred to the rank
of a major-general. The virtuous E&s;tifania did
not long &s;urvive this melancholy accident; and
the lo&s;s of the&s;e indulgent parents, made &s;uch a
deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the tender heart of my An|tonia,
that I took the fir&s;t opportunity of re|moving
her from a place, in which every object
&s;erved to cheri&s;h her grief, to a plea&s;ant villa,
near the city of Seville, which I purcha&s;ed on
account of its agreeable &s;ituation. That I might
the more perfectly enjoy the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my
amiable partner, who could no longer brook
the thoughts of another &s;eparation, pea$e was
no &s;ooner re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, than I obtained leave to
<PB N="180" REF="189">
re&s;ign my commi&s;&s;ion, and I wholly devoted my|&s;elf
to the joys of a dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P>Heaven &s;eemed to &s;mile upon our union, by
ble&s;&s;ing us with a &s;on, whom, however, it was
plea&s;ed to recall in his infancy, to our un&s;peak|able
grief and mortification; but, our mutual
chagrin was afterwards alleviated, by the birth
of a daughter, who &s;eemed born with every ac|compli&s;hment
to excite the love and admiration
of mankind. Why did nature deba&s;e &s;uch a
ma&s;ter-piece with the mixture of an allay, which
hath involved her&s;elf and her whole family in
perdition? but the ways of Providence are un|&s;earchable.
She hath paid the debt of her dege|neracy;
peace be with her &s;oul! the honour of
my family is vindicated; though by a &s;acrifice
which hath robbed me of every thing el&s;e that
is valuable in life, and ruined my peace pa&s;t all
redemption. Yes, my friend, all the tortures
that human tyranny can inflict, would be ea&s;e,
tranquillity and delight, to the un&s;peakable pangs
and horrors I have felt.</P>
<P>But, to return from this digre&s;&s;ion: Serafina,
which was the name of that little darling, as
&s;he grew up, not only di&s;clo&s;ed all the natural
graces of external beauty, but likewi&s;e manife&s;t|ed
the mo&s;t engaging &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition,
and a capacity for acquiring with ea&s;e, all the
accompli&s;hments of her &s;ex. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to
convey any adequate idea of a parent's raptures
in the contemplation of &s;uch a fair blo&s;&s;om;
&s;he was the only pledge of our love, &s;he was
pre&s;umptive heire&s;s to a large fortune, and likely
to be the &s;ole repre&s;entative of two noble Ca&s;ti|lian
families. She was the delight of all who
&s;aw her, and a theme of prai&s;e for every tongue.
<PB N="181" REF="190">
You are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that the education o$
&s;uch a child was neglected. Indeed it wholly
engro&s;&s;ed the attention of me and my Antonia,
and her proficiency rewarded our care. Before
&s;he had attained the age of fifteen, &s;he was
mi&s;tre&s;s of every elegant qualification, natural
and acquired. Her per&s;on was, by that time, the
confe&s;&s;ed pattern of beauty. Her voice was en|chantingly
&s;weet, and &s;he touched the lute with
the mo&s;t ravi&s;hing dexterity. Heaven and earth!
how did my brea&s;t dilate with joy, at the thoughts
of having given birth to &s;uch perfection! how
did my heart gu&s;h with paternal fondne&s;s, when|ever
I beheld this ornament of my name! and
what &s;cenes of endearing tran&s;port, have I en|joyed
with my Antonia, in mutual congratula|tion
upon our parental happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Serafina, accompli&s;hed as &s;he was, could not
fail to make conque&s;ts among the Spani&s;h cava|liers,
who are famous for &s;en&s;ibility in love. In|deed,
&s;he never appeared without a numerous
train of admirers, and though we had bred her
up in that freedom of conver&s;ation and inter|cour&s;e,
which holds a middle &s;pace, between the
French licen&s;e and Spani&s;h re&s;traint, &s;he was
now &s;o much expo&s;ed to the addre&s;&s;es of pro|mi&s;cuous
gallantry, that we found it nece&s;&s;ary
to retrench the liberty of our hou&s;e; and behave
to our male vi&s;itants with great re&s;erve and cir|cum&s;pection,
that our honour! and peace might
run no ri&s;que from the youth and inexperience
of our daughter.</P>
<P>This caution produced overtures from a great
many young gentlemen of rank and di&s;tinction,
who courted my alliance by demanding Sera|fina
in marriage; and from the number, I had
<PB N="182" REF="191">
actually &s;elected one per&s;on, who was in all re&s;|pects
worthy the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an ine&s;tima|ble
prize. His name was Don Manuel de Men|doza;
his birth was noble, and his character dig|nified
with repeated acts of genero&s;ity and vir|tue.
Yet, before I would &s;ignify to him my
approbation of his &s;uit, I re&s;olved to inform my|&s;elf,
whether or not the heart of Serafina was to|tally
unengaged, and indifferent to any other
object, that I might not lay a tyrannical re&s;traint
upon her inclinations. The re&s;ult of my en|quiry
was a full conviction of her having hither|to
been deaf to the voice of love; and this piece
of information, together with my own &s;entiments
in his favour, I communicated to Don Manuel,
who heard the&s;e tidings with tran&s;ports of grati|tude
and joy. He was immediately favoured
with opportunities of acquiring the affection of
my daughter, and his endeavours were at fir&s;t
received with &s;uch re&s;pectful civility, as might
have been ea&s;ily warmed into a mutual pa&s;&s;ion,
had not the evil genius of our family inter|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>O my friend! how &s;hall I de&s;cribe the depra|vity
of that unhappy virgin's &s;entiments! how
recount the particulars of my own di&s;honour
I that am de&s;cended from a long line of illu&s;tri|ous
Ca&s;tilians, who never received an injury they
did not revenge; but wa&s;hed away every blemi&s;t$
in their fame, with the blood of tho&s;e who at|tempted
to &s;tain it. In that circum&s;tance, $word$
have imitated the example of my glorious proge|nitors;
and that con&s;ideration alone, hath &s;up|ported
me again&s;t all the a&s;&s;aults of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>As I grudged no pains and expence in perfectin$
the education of Serafina, my doors were open $word$
<PB N="183" REF="192">
every per&s;on who made an extraordinary figure in
the profe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e amu&s;ing &s;ciences, in which
&s;he delighted. The hou&s;e of Don Diego de Zelos
was a little academy for painting, poetry and mu|&s;ic;
and Heaven decreed that it &s;hould fall a &s;acrifice
to its regard for the&s;e fatal and delu&s;ive arts.
Among other pr$ceptors, it was her fate to be
under the in&s;truction of a cur&s;ed German; who,
though his profe&s;&s;ion was drawing, under&s;tood
the elements and theory of mu&s;ick, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
large fund of learning and ta&s;te, and was a per|&s;on
remarkable for his agreeable conver&s;ation.
This traitor, who like you, had lo&s;t one eye, I
not only admitted into my hou&s;e, for the im|provement
of my daughter, but even di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
with particular marks of confidence and fa|vour;
little thinking he had either inclination or
capacity to debauch the &s;entiments of my child.
I was rejoiced beyond mea&s;ure, to &s;ee with what
alacrity &s;he received his le&s;&s;ons, with what avi|dity
&s;he li&s;tened to his di&s;cour&s;e, which was al|ways
equally moral, in&s;tructing and enter|taining.</P>
<P>Antonia &s;eemed to vie with me, in expre&s;|&s;ions
of regard for this accompli&s;hed &s;tranger,
whom &s;he could not help &s;uppo&s;ing to be a per|&s;on
of rank and family, reduced to his pre&s;ent
&s;ituation, by &s;ome unfortunate vici&s;&s;itude of fate.
I was di&s;po&s;ed to concur with this opinion, and
actually conjured him to make me his confident,
with &s;uch prote&s;tations, as left him no room to
doubt my honour and beneficence; but he &s;till
per&s;i&s;ted in declaring him&s;elf the &s;on of an ob|&s;cure
mechanic in Bohemia; an origin to which
&s;urely no man would pretend, who had the lea&s;t
<PB N="184" REF="193">
claim to nobility of birth. While I was thus
undeceived in my conjecture, touching his birth
and quality, I was confirmed in an opinion of
his integrity and moderation, and looked upon
him as a man of honour, in de&s;pite of the low|ne&s;s
of his pedigree. Neverthele&s;s he was at
bottom, a mo&s;t perfidious wretch, and all this
mode&s;ty and &s;elf-denial were the effects of the
mo&s;t villainous di&s;&s;imulation, a cloak under which
he un&s;u&s;pected robbed me of my honour and my
peace.</P>
<P>Not to trouble you with particulars, the reci|tal
of which would tear my heart-&s;trings with
indignation and remor&s;e, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve,
that by the power of his infernal in&s;inuation,
he fa&s;cinated the heart of Serafina, brought over
Antonia her&s;elf to the intere&s;ts of his pa&s;&s;ion,
and at once detached them both from their duty
and religion. Heaven and earth! how dange|rous,
how irre&s;i&s;tible is the power of infatuation!
while I remained in the mid&s;t of this blind &s;e|curity,
waiting for the nuptials of my daughter,
and indulging my&s;elf with the vain pro&s;pect of
her approaching felicity, Antonia found means
to protract the negociation of the marriage, by
repre&s;enting that it would be pity to deprive Se|rafina
of the opportunity &s;he then had of pro|fiting
by the German's in&s;tructions; and upon
that account I prevailed upon Don Manuel to
bridle the impatience of his love.</P>
<P>During this interval, as I one evening enjoyed
the cool air in my own garden, I was acco&s;ted
by an old duenna, who had been my nu$&s;e, and
lived in the family &s;ince the time of my childhood.
&startq;My duty, &s;aid &s;he, will no longer permit me
to wink in &s;ilence, at the wrongs I &s;ee you dai|ly
<PB N="185" REF="194">
&s;uffer. Di&s;mi&s;s that German from your hou&s;e,
without delay, if you re&s;pect the glory of your
name, and the rights of our holy religion: the
&s;tranger is an abominable heretic; and, grant
Heaven! he may not have already poi&s;oned the
minds of tho&s;e you hold mo&s;t dear.&endq; I had
been extremely alarmed at the beginning of this
addre&s;s, but finding the imputation limited to
the article of religion, in which, thank God, I
am no bigot, I recovered my &s;erenitiy of di&s;po|&s;ition,
thanked the old woman for her zeal, com|mended
her piety, and encouraged her to per&s;e|vere
in making ob&s;ervations on &s;uch &s;ubjects as
&s;hould concern my honour and my quiet.</P>
<P>We live in &s;uch a world of wickedne&s;s and
fraud, that a man cannot be too vigilant in his
own defence: had I employed &s;uch &s;pies from
the beginning, I &s;hould, in all probability, have
been at this day in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every comfort
that renders life agreeable. The duenna thus
authorized, employed her &s;agacity with &s;uch &s;uc|ce&s;s,
that I had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the German
of a de&s;ign upon the heart of Serafina; but, as
the pre&s;umptions did not amount to conviction,
I contented my&s;elf with exiling him from my
hou&s;e, under the pretext of having di&s;covered,
that he was an enemy to the catholic church;
and forthwith appointed a day for the celebration
of my daughter's marriage, with Don Manuel de
Mendo&s;a. I could ea&s;ily perceive a cloud of me|lancholy
over&s;pread the faces of Serafina and
her mother, when I declared the&s;e my re&s;olu|tions;
but, as they made no objection to what
I propo&s;ed, I did not, at that time, enter into an
explanation of the true motives that influenced
<PB N="186" REF="195">
my conduct. Both parties were, probably,
afraid of &s;uch expo&s;tulation.</P>
<P>Mean while, preparations were made for the
&s;pou&s;als of Serafina; and, notwith&s;tanding the
anxiety I had undergone, on account of her con|nexion
with the German, I began to think that
her duty, her g'ory, had triumphed over all &s;uch
low-born con&s;iderations, if ever they had been
entertained; becau&s;e &s;he and even Antonia &s;eemed
to expect the ceremony with re&s;ignation, though
the features of both &s;till retained evident marks
of concern, which I willingly imputed to the
mutual pro&s;pect of their &s;eparation. This, how|ever,
was but a faithle&s;s calm, that &s;oon, ah!
too &s;oon, brought forth a tempe&s;t, which hath
wrecked my hopes.</P>
<P>Two days before the appointed union of don
Manuel and Serafina, I was informed by the du|enna,
that while &s;he accompanied Antonia's
waiting maid at church, &s;he had &s;een her receive
a billet from a$ old woman, who, kneeling at
her &s;ide, had conveyed it in &s;uch a my&s;terious
manner, as wakened the duenna's apprehen&s;ions
about her young lady; &s;he had therefore ha&s;tened
home to communicate this piece of intelligence,
that I might have an opportunity of examining
the me&s;&s;enger before &s;he &s;hould have time to de|po&s;it
her tru&s;t. I could not help &s;hivering with
fearful pre&s;ages, upon this occa&s;ion, and even
abhorring the per&s;on to who&s;e duty and zeal $word$
was beholden for the intelligence, even while $word$
endeavoured to per&s;uade my&s;elf, that the inquiry
would end in the detection of &s;ome paultry in|trigue,
between the maid and her own gallant,
I intercepted her in returning from church, and
commanding her to follow me to a convenient
<PB N="187" REF="196">
place, extorted from her by dint of threats, the
fatal letter, which I read to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>&startq;The whole bu&s;ine&s;s of my life, O divine
Serafina! will be to repay that affection I

tran&s;port then &s;hall I obey your &s;ummons, in

</LETTER>
<P>Were you a fond parent, a tender hu&s;band and
a noble Ca&s;tilia$, I &s;hould not need to mention
the unutterable horrors that took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
my bo&s;om, when I peru&s;ed this accur&s;ed letter,
by which I learned the apo&s;ta&s;y, di&s;obedience,
and degeneracy of my idolized Serafina, who
had overthrown and de&s;troyed the whole plan of
felicity which I had erected, and bla&s;ted all the
glories of my name; and when the wretched
me&s;&s;enger, terrified by my menaces and agita|tion,
confe&s;&s;ed that Antonia her&s;elf was privy to
the guilt of her daughter, whom &s;he had &s;o|lemly
betrothed to that vile German, in the
fight of Heaven, and that by her connivance,
this Plebeian intended that very night, to bereave
me of my child; I was for &s;ome moments &s;tu|pified
<PB N="188" REF="197">
with grief and amazement, that gave way
to an exta&s;y of rage, which had well-nigh ter|minated
in de&s;pair and di&s;traction.</P>
<P>I now tremble, and my head grows giddy
with the remembrance of that dreadful occa|&s;ion:
behold how the drops trickle down
my forehead; this agony is a fierce and familiar
vi&s;itant, I &s;hall bani&s;h it anon. I &s;ummoned
my pride, my re&s;entment to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the&s;e
are the cordials that &s;upport me again&s;t all other
reflections; tho&s;e were the auxiliaries that ena|bled
me in the day of trial, to perform that &s;a|crifice
which my honour demanded, in a &s;train
&s;o loud, as to drown the cries of nature, love
and compa&s;&s;ion. Yes, they e&s;pou&s;ed that glory,
which humanity would have betrayed, and my
revenge was noble, though unnatural.</P>
<P>My &s;cheme was &s;oon laid, my re&s;olution &s;oon
taken; I privately confined the wretch who had
been the indu&s;trious &s;lave of this infamous con|&s;piracy,
that &s;he might take no &s;tep to fru&s;trate,
or interrupt the execution of my de&s;ign. Then
repairing to the hou&s;e of an apothecary, who
was devoted to my &s;ervice, communicated my
intention, which he dur&s;t not condemn, and
could not reveal, without breaking the oath of
&s;ecrecy I had impo&s;ed; and he furni&s;hed me
with two vials of poi&s;on, for the di&s;mal cata&s;|trophe
I had planned. Thus provided, I on
pretence of &s;udden bu&s;ine&s;s at Seville, carefully
avoided the dear, the wretched pair, whom I
had devoted to death, that my heart might not
relent, by means of tho&s;e tender ideas, which
the &s;ight of them would have infallibly in&s;pired;
and when day-light vani&s;hed, took my &s;tation
near that part of the hou&s;e, through which the
<PB N="189" REF="198">
villain mu&s;t have entered, on his helli&s;h pur|po&s;e.
There I &s;tood in a &s;tate of horrid expec|tation,
my &s;oul ravaged with the different pa&s;|&s;ions
that a&s;&s;ailed it, until the fatal moment ar|rived;
when I perceived the traitor approach the
window of a lower apartment, which led into
that of Serafina, and gently lifting the ca&s;e|ment,
which was purpo&s;ely left un&s;ecured, in&s;i|nuate
half of his body into the hou&s;e: then ru&s;h|ing
upon him, in a tran&s;port of fury, I plunged my
&s;word into his heart, crying &startq;Villain! receive
the reward of thy treachery and pre&s;umption.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;teel was &s;o well aimed as to render a
repetition of the &s;troke unnece&s;&s;ary; he uttered
one groan, and fell breathle&s;s at my feet. Ex|ulting
with this fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s of my revenge, I
penetrated into the chamber, where the robber
of my peace was expected by the unhappy Sera|fina
and her mother, who &s;eeing me enter with
a mo&s;t &s;avage a&s;pect, and a &s;word reeking with
the vengeance I had taken, &s;eemed almo&s;t petri|fied
with fear. &startq;Behold,&endq; &s;aid I, &startq;the blood
of that ba&s;e plebeian, who made an attempt up|on
the honour of my hou&s;e: your con&s;piracy a|gain&s;t
the unfortunate Don Diego de Zelos, is
now di&s;covered; that pre&s;umptuous &s;lave, the
favoured Orlando, is now no more.&endq;</P>
<P>Scarce had I pronounced the&s;e words, when a
loud &s;cream was uttered by both the unhappy
victims. &startq;If Orlando is &s;lain, cried the infa|tuated
Serafina, what have I to do with life?
O my dear lord! my hu&s;band, and my lover!
how are our promi&s;ed joys at once cut off! here
&s;trike, my father, compleat your barbarous &s;a|crifice,
the &s;pirit of the murdered Orlando &s;till
hovers for his wife.&endq; The&s;e frantic exclama|tions,
<PB N="190" REF="199">
in which &s;he was joined by Antonia, kept
up the fury of my re&s;entment, which by meek|ne&s;s
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion might have been weakened
and rendered ineffectual. &startq;Yes, haple&s;s
wretches,&endq; I replied, &startq;ye &s;hall enjoy your wi&s;h:
the honour of my name requires that both &s;hall
die; yet I will not mangle the brea&s;t of An|tonia,
on which I have &s;o often repo&s;ed;
I will not &s;hed the blood of Zelos, nor
disfigure the beauteous form of Serafina, on
which I have &s;o often gazed with wonder and
un&s;peakable delight: here is an elixir, to which
I tru&s;t the con&s;ummation of my revenge.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, I emptied the vials into &s;eparate
cups, and pre&s;enting one in each hand, the mi|&s;erable,
the fair offenders, in&s;tantly received the
de&s;tined draughts, which they drank without
he&s;itation: then praying to Heaven for the
wretched Don Diego, &s;unk upon the &s;ame couch,
and expired without a groan. O well-contrived
beverage! O happy compo&s;ition, by which all
the mi&s;eries of life are &s;o ea&s;ily cured!</P>
<P>Such was the fate of Antonia and Serafina;
the&s;e hands were the in&s;truments that deprived
them of life, the&s;e eyes beheld them the riche&s;t
prize that death had ever won. Powers &s;u|preme!
does Don Diego live to make this reca|pitulation?
I have done my duty; but ah! I
am haunted by the furies of remor&s;e: I am tor|tured
with the ince&s;&s;ant &s;tings of remembrance
and regret; even now the images of my wife
and daughter, pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my imagi|nation.
All the &s;cenes of happine&s;s I have en|joyed
as a lover, hu&s;band and parent, all the en|dearing
hopes I have cheri&s;hed, now pa&s;s in re|view
before me, embittering the circum&s;tances
of my inexpre&s;&s;ible woe; and I con&s;ider my&s;elf
<PB N="191" REF="200">
as a &s;olitary outca&s;t from all the comforts of &s;o|ciety.
But, enough of the&s;e unmanly complaints,
the yearnings of nature are too importunate.</P>
<P>Having compleated my vengeance, I retired
into my clo&s;et, and furni&s;hing my&s;elf with &s;ome
ready money and jewels of con&s;iderable value,
went into the &s;table, &s;addled my favourite &s;teed,
which I in&s;tantly mounted, and before the tu|mults
of my brea&s;t &s;ub&s;ided, found my&s;elf at the
town of St. Lucar. There I learned from in|quiry,
that there was a Dutch bark in the har|bour
ready to &s;ail; upon which, I addre&s;&s;ed my|&s;elf
to the ma&s;ter, who for a &s;uitable gratifica|tion,
was prevailed upon to weigh anchor that
&s;ame night; &s;o that embarking without delay, I
&s;oon bid eternal adieu to my native country. It
was not from rea&s;on and reflection, that I took
the&s;e mea&s;ures for my per&s;onal &s;afety; but in
con&s;equence of an involuntary in&s;tinct, that &s;eems
to operate in the animal machine, while the fa|culty
of thinking is &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>To what a dreadful reckoning was I called,
when rea&s;on re&s;umed her function! you may
believe me, my friend, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that
I &s;hould not have outlived tho&s;e tragedies I act|ed,
had I not been re&s;trained from doing vio|lence
upon my&s;elf, by certain con&s;iderations,
which no man of honour ought to &s;et a&s;ide. I
could not bear the thought of falling ingloriou&s;ly
by the hand of an executioner, and intailing
di&s;grace upon a family that knew no &s;tain; and
I was deterred from putting an end to my own
mi&s;ery, by the apprehen&s;ions of po&s;thumous
cen&s;ure, which would have repre&s;ented me as a
de&s;ponding wretch, utterly de&s;titute of that pa|tience,
fortitude and re&s;ignation, which are the
<PB N="192" REF="201">
characteri&s;tics of a true Ca&s;tilian. I was al&s;o influ|enced
by religious motives, that &s;ugge&s;ted to me
the nece&s;&s;ity of living to attone by my &s;ufferings
and &s;orrow, for the guilt I had incurred, in
complying with a &s;avage punctilio, which is, I
fear, di&s;plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of Heaven.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the rea&s;ons that oppo&s;ed my en|trance
into that peaceful harbour, which death
pre&s;ented to my view; and they were &s;oon re|inforced
by another principle, that &s;anctioned
my determination, to continue at the &s;ervile oar
of life. In con&s;equence of unfavourable winds,
our ve&s;&s;el for &s;ome days made &s;mall progre&s;s
in her voyage to Holland, and near the coa&s;t of
Gallicia we were joined by an Engli&s;h &s;hip
from Vigo, the ma&s;ter of which gave us to un|der&s;tand,
that before he &s;et fail, a courier had
arrived from Madrid, at that place, with orders
for the corregidor, to prevent the e&s;cape of any
native Spaniard, by &s;ea, from any port within
his di&s;trict; and to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to
apprehend the per&s;on of Don Diego de Zelos,
who was &s;u&s;pected of trea&s;onable practices
again&s;t the &s;tate. Such an order, with a mi|nute
de&s;cription of my per&s;on, was at the &s;ame
time, di&s;patched to all the &s;ea-ports and frontier
places in Spain.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e how I, who was al|ready
overwhelmed with di&s;tre&s;s, could bear
this aggravation of misfortune and di&s;grace: I,
who had always maintained the reputation of
loyalty, which was acquired at the hazard of
my life, and the expence of my blood. To
deal candidly, I mu&s;t own, that this intelligence
rou&s;ed me from a lethargy of grief, which had
begun to overpower my faculties. I immediately
<PB N="193" REF="202">
imputed this di&s;honourable charge to the evil of|fices
of &s;ome villain, who had ba&s;ely taken
the advantage of my deplorable &s;ituation, and I
was inflamed, in&s;pirited with the de&s;ire of vindi|cating
my &s;ame, and revenging the injury. Thus
animated, I re&s;olved to di&s;gui&s;e my&s;elf effectu|ally
from the ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e &s;pies, which
every nation finds its account in employing, in
foreign countries; I purcha&s;ed this habit from
the Dutch navigator, in who&s;e hou&s;e I kept my|&s;elf
concealed, after our arrival at Am&s;terdam,
until my beard was grown to a &s;ufficient length
to favour my de&s;ign, and then appeared as a Per|&s;ian
dealer in jewels. As I could gain no &s;atis|factory
information touching my&s;elf, in this
country, had no purpo&s;e to pur&s;ue, and was
extremely mi&s;erable among a people, who being
mercenary and un&s;ocial, were very ill adapted to
alleviate the horrors of my condition; I grati|fied
my landlord for his important &s;ervices, with
the be&s;t part of my effects; and having, by his
means, procured a certificate from the magi|&s;tracy,
repaired to Rotterdam, from whence I
&s;et out in a travelling carriage for Antwerp, on
my way to this capital; hoping with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of different objects, to mitigate the angui&s;h of
my mind, and by the mo&s;t indu&s;trious enquiry,
to learn &s;uch particulars of that fal&s;e impeach|ment,
as would enable me to take mea&s;ures for
my own ju&s;tification, as well as for projecting a
plan of revenge again&s;t the vile perfidious au|thor.</P>
<P>This, I imagined, would be no difficult ta&s;k,
con&s;idering the friend&s;hip and intercour&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing
between the Spani&s;h and French nations, and
the communicative di&s;po&s;ition, for which the
<PB N="194" REF="203">
Pari&s;ians are renowned; but I have found my&s;elf
egregiou&s;ly deceived in my expectation: the of|ficers
of the Police in this city are &s;o inqui&s;itive
and vigilant, that the mo&s;t minute action of a
&s;tranger, is &s;crutinized with great &s;everity; and
although the inhabitants are very frank in di&s;|cour&s;ing
on indifferent &s;ubjects, they are at the
&s;ame time extremely cautious in avoiding all con|ver&s;ation
that turns upon &s;tate occurrences and
maxims of government. In a word, the pecu|liarity
of my appearance, &s;ubjects me &s;o much
to particular ob&s;ervation, that I have hitherto
thought proper to devour my griefs in &s;ilence,
and even to bear the want of almo&s;t every con|venience,
rather than hazard a premature di&s;co|very,
by offering my jewels to &s;ale.</P>
<P>In this emergency, I have been &s;o far fortu|nate
as to become acquainted with you, whom I
look upon as a man of honour and humanity.
Indeed, I was at fir&s;t fight, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in your
favour: for notwith&s;tanding the mi&s;takes which
men daily commit in judging from appearances,
there is &s;omething in the phy&s;iognomy of a
&s;tranger, from which one cannot help forming
an opinion of his character and di&s;po&s;ition. For
once, my penetration hath not failed me; your
behaviour ju&s;tifies my deci&s;ion, you have treated
me with that &s;ympathy and re&s;pect which none
but the generous will pay to the unfortunate. I
have tru&s;ted you accordingly: I have put my
life, my honour in your power; and I mu&s;t beg
leave to depend upon your friend&s;hip, for obtain|ing
that &s;atisfaction, for which alone I &s;eek to
live. Your employment engages you in the gay
world: you daily mingle with the &s;ocieties of
men; the dome&s;tics of the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ader
<PB N="195" REF="204">
will not &s;hun your acquaintance; you may fre|quent
the coffee-hou&s;es to which they re&s;ort;

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A flagrant in&s;tance of Fathom's virtue, in the man|ner
of his retreat to England.</HEAD>
<P>FATHOM, who had lent an attentive ear
to every circum&s;tance of this di&s;a&s;trous
&s;tory, no &s;ooner heard it concluded, than with
an a&s;pect of generous and cordial compa&s;&s;ion,
not even unattended with tears, he condoled the
lamentable fate of Don Diego de Zelos; deplored
the untimely death of the gentle Antonia and
the fair Serafina, and undertook the intere&s;ts of
the wretched Ca&s;tilian with &s;uch warmth of
&s;ympathizing zeal, as drew a flood from his eyes,
while he wrung his benefactor's hand in a tran&s;|port
of gratitude. Tho&s;e were literally tears of
joy, or at lea&s;t of &s;atisfaction on both &s;ides; as
our hero wept with affection and attachment to
the jewels that were to be committed to his
care: but, far from di&s;covering the true &s;ource
of his tenderne&s;s, he affected to di&s;&s;uade the
Spaniard from parting with the diamonds, which
he coun&s;elled him to re&s;erve for a more pre&s;&s;ing
occa&s;ion; and in the mean time, earne&s;tly in|treated
<PB N="196" REF="205">
him to depend upon his friend&s;hip, for
pre&s;ent relief. This generous proffer &s;erved only
to confirm Don Diego's re&s;olution, which he
forthwith executed, by putting into the hands of
Ferdinand, jewels to the value of a thou&s;and
crowns, and de&s;iring him to detain for his own
u&s;e, any part of the &s;um they would rai&s;e.</P>
<P>Our adventurer thanked him for the good opi|nion
he entertained of his integrity, an opinion
fully manife&s;ted in honouring him with &s;uch im|portant
confidence; and a&s;&s;ured him he would
tran&s;act his affairs with the utmo&s;t diligence,
caution and di&s;patch. The evening being by
this time almo&s;t con&s;umed, the&s;e new allies re|tired
&s;eparately to re&s;t: though each pa&s;&s;ed the
night without repo&s;e, in very different reflecti|ons;
the Ca&s;tilian being, as u&s;ual, agitated with
the uncea&s;ing pangs of his unalterable mi&s;ery,
inter&s;per&s;ed with gleaming hopes of revenge;
and Fathom being kept awake with revolving
plans, for turning his fellow-lodger's credulity to
his own advantage. From the nature of the
Spaniard's &s;ituation, he might have appropriated
the jewels to him&s;elf, and remained in Paris,
without fear of a pro&s;ecution, becau&s;e the in|jured
party had, by the above narrative, left his
life and liberty at di&s;cretion. But he did not
think him&s;elf &s;ecure from the per&s;onal re&s;ent|ment
of an enraged de&s;perate Ca&s;tilian; and
therefore determined to withdraw him&s;elf pri|vately
into that country where he had all along
propo&s;ed to fix the &s;tandard of his fine&s;&s;e, which
fortune had now impowered him to exerci&s;e ac|cording
to his wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Bent upon this retreat, he went abroad in the
morning, on pretence of acting in the concerns
<PB N="197" REF="206">
of his friend Don Diego, and having hired a
po&s;t-chai&s;e to be ready at the dawn of next
day, returned to his lodgings, where he cajoled
the Spaniard with a &s;eigned report of his nego|tiation;
then &s;ecuring his mo&s;t valuable effects
about his per&s;on, aro&s;e with the cock, repaired
to the place, at which he had appointed to meet
the po&s;ti$ion with the carriage, and &s;et out for
England without further delay; leaving the un|happy
Zelos to the horrors of indigence, and the
additional agony of this fre&s;h di&s;appointment.
Yet he was not the only per&s;on affected by the
abrupt departure of Fathom, which was ha&s;ten|ed
by the importunities, threats and reproaches
of his landlord's daughter, whom he had de|bauched
under promi&s;e of marriage, and now
left in the fourth month of her pregnancy.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the dangerous adventure in
which he had been formerly involved by travel|ing
in the night, he did not think proper to
make the u&s;ual halts on this journey, for &s;leep
or refre&s;hment, nor did he once quit the
chai&s;e, till his arrival at Boulogne, which he
reached in twenty hours, after his departure from
Paris. Here he thought he might &s;afely indulge
him&s;elf with a comfortable meal; accordingly,
he be&s;poke a poulard for dinner, and while that
was preparing, went forth to view the city and
harbour. When he beheld the white cliffs of
Albion, his heart throbbed with all the joy of a
beloved &s;on, who after a tedious and fatiguing
voyage, reviews the chimneys of his father's
hou&s;e: he &s;urveyed the neighbouring coa&s;t of
England, with fond and longing eyes, like ano|ther
Mo&s;es reconnoitring the land of Canaan
from the top of mount Pi&s;gah: and to &s;uch a
<PB N="198" REF="207">
degree of impatience was he enflamed by the
&s;ight, that in&s;tead of proceeding to Calais, he
re&s;olved to take his pa&s;&s;age directly from Bou|logne,
even if he &s;hould hire a ve&s;&s;el for the pur|po&s;e.
With the&s;e &s;entiments, he inquired if
there was any &s;hip bound for England, and was
&s;o fortunate as to find the ma&s;ter of a &s;mall bark,
who intended to weigh anchor for Deal, that
&s;ame evening at high water.</P>
<P>Tran&s;ported with this information, he imme|diately
agreed for his pa&s;&s;age, &s;old the po&s;t|chai&s;e
to his landlord for thirty guineas, as a
piece of furniture, for which he could have no
further u&s;e, purcha&s;ed a portmanteau, together
with &s;ome linen and wearing apparel, and at
the recommendation of his ho&s;t, took into his
&s;ervice, an extra-po&s;tilion or helper, who had
formerly wore the livery of a travelling marquis.
This new dome&s;tic, who&s;e name was Maurice,
underwent with great applau&s;e, the examination
of our hero, who perceived in him, a fund of
&s;agacity and pre&s;ence of mind, by which he was
excellently qualified for being the valet of an
adventurer; he was therefore accommodated
with a &s;econd hand &s;uit, and another &s;hirt, and
at once li&s;ted under the banners of count Fa|thom,
who &s;pent the whole afternoon in giving
him proper in&s;tructions for the regulation of his
conduct.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled the&s;e preliminaries to his own
&s;atisfaction, he and his baggage were embarked
about &s;ix o'clock in the month of September,
and it was not without emotion, that he found
him&s;elf benighted upon the great deep, of which,
before the preceding day, he had never enjoyed
even the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect. However, he
<PB N="199" REF="208">
was not a man to be afraid, where there was
really no apppearance of danger; and the agree|able
pre&s;ages of future fortune &s;upported his
&s;pirits, amid&s;t the di&s;agreeable nau&s;ea which
commonly attends landmen at &s;ea, until he was
&s;et a&s;hore upon the beach at Deal, which he
entered in good health about &s;even o'clock in the
morning.</P>
<P>Like Cae&s;ar, however, he found &s;ome diffi|culty
in landing, on account of the &s;welling
&s;urf, that tumbled about with &s;uch violence, as
had almo&s;t over&s;et the cutter that carried him
on &s;hore; and in his eagerne&s;s to jump upon
the &s;trand, his foot &s;lipped from the &s;ide of the
boat, &s;o that he was thrown forwards in an ho|rizontal
direction, and his hands were the fir&s;t
parts of him that touched the Engli&s;h ground.
Upon this occa&s;ion, he, in imitation of Scipio's
behaviour on the coa&s;t of Afric, hailed the
omen, and gra&s;ping an handful of the &s;and, was
heard to exclaim in the Italian language, &startq;Ah
ha, old England, I have thee fa&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>As he walked up to the inn, followed by Mau|rice
loaded with his portmanteau, he congratu|lated
him&s;elf upon his happy voyage, and the
peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;poil, and could not
help &s;nuffing up the Briti&s;h air with marks of
infinite reli&s;h and &s;atisfaction. His fir&s;t care was
to recompence him&s;elf for the want of &s;leep he
had undergone, and after he had &s;ufficiently re|cruited
him&s;elf with &s;everal hours of uninter|rupted
repo&s;e, he &s;et out in a po&s;t-chai&s;e for
Canterbury, where he took a place in the Lon|don
&s;tage, which, he was told, would depart
next morning, the coach being already full.
On this very fir&s;t day of his arrival, he perceived
<PB N="200" REF="209">
between the Engli&s;h and the people among whom
he had hitherto lived, &s;uch e&s;&s;ential difference
in cu&s;toms, appearance, and way of living, as
in&s;pired him with high notions of that Briti&s;h
freedom, opulence, and convenience on which
he had often heard his mother expatiate. On
the road, he fea&s;ted his eye-&s;ight with the ver|dant
hills covered with flocks of &s;heep, the fruit|ful
vales parcelled out into cultivated inclo&s;ures;
the very cattle &s;eemed to profit by the wealth of
their ma&s;ters, being large, &s;turdy and &s;leek, and
every pea&s;ant breathed the in&s;olence of liberty
and independance. In a word, he viewed the
wide extended plains of Kent, with a lover's
eye, and his ambition becoming romantic, could
not help fancying him&s;elf another conqueror of
the i&s;le.</P>
<P>He was not, however, long amu&s;ed by the&s;e
vain chimeras, which &s;oon vani&s;hed before other
reflections of more importance and &s;olidity.
His imagination, it mu&s;t be owned, was at all
times too cha&s;te, to admit tho&s;e over-weening
hopes, which often mi&s;lead the mind of a pro|jector.
He had &s;tudied mankind with incredible
diligence, and knew perfectly well how far he
could depend on the pa&s;&s;ions and foibles of hu|man
nature. That he might now act con&s;i&s;tent
with his former &s;agacity, he re&s;olved to pa&s;s him|&s;elf
upon his fellow travellers, for a French gen|tleman,
equally a &s;tranger to the language and
country of England, in order to glean from
their di&s;cour&s;e, &s;uch intelligence as might avail
him in his future operations; and his lacquey
was tutored accordingly.</P>

<P>THOSE who had taken places for the
coach, under&s;tanding the &s;ixth &s;eat was
engaged by a foreigner, determined to profit by
his ignorance; and with that politene&s;s which is
peculiar to this happy i&s;land, fixed them&s;elves in
the vehicle, in &s;uch a manner, before he had
the lea&s;t intimation of their de&s;ign, that he found
it barely practicable to in&s;inuate him&s;elf &s;idelong
between a corpulent quaker and a fat Wapping|landlady,
in which attitude he &s;tuck fa&s;t, like a
thin quarto between two voluminous dictionaries
on a book&s;eller's &s;helf: and as if the pain and
inconvenience of &s;uch compre&s;&s;ion, was not &s;uf|ficient
matter of chagrin, the greate&s;t part of
the company entertained them&s;elves with laugh|ing
at his ludicrous &s;tation.</P>
<P>The jolly dame at his left hand, ob&s;erved with
a loud exclamation of mirth, that Mon&s;ieur
would be &s;oon better acquainted with a buttock of
Engli&s;h beef; and &s;aid by that time they &s;hould

the better for you,&endq; cried mine ho&s;te&s;s, &startq;for
that &s;ide is all your own.&endq; The quaker was
not &s;o much di&s;concerted by the quickne&s;s of
this repartee, but that he an&s;wered with great
deliberation, &startq;I thank thee for thy love, but
will not profit by thy lo&s;s; e&s;pecially as I like
not the &s;avour of the&s;e outlandi&s;h fowls; they
<PB N="202" REF="211">
are profane birds of pa&s;&s;age, reli&s;hed only by the
children of vanity, like thee.&endq;</P>
<P>The plump gentlewoman took umbrage at
this la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, which &s;he con&s;idered as a
double reproach, and repeated the words &startq;Chil|dren
of vanity!&endq; with an empha&s;is of re&s;ent|ment.
&startq;I believe, if the truth were known,
&s;aid &s;he&punc; there's more vanity than midri&s;&s;, in
that great belly of yours, for all your pretend|ing
to humility and religion. Sirrah! my cor|poration
is made up of good, whol&s;ome Engli&s;h
fat; but you are puffed up with the wind of va|nity
and delu&s;ion; and when it begins to gripe
your entrails, you pretend to have a motion,
and then get up and preach non&s;en&s;e: yet, you'll
take it upon you to call your betters children;
marry come up, Mr. Goo&s;e-cap, I have got
children that are as good men as you, or any
hypocritical trembler in England.&endq;</P>
<P>A per&s;on who &s;at oppo&s;ite to the quaker, hear|ing
this remon&s;trance, which &s;eemed pregnant
with contention, interpo&s;ed in the conver&s;ation
with a con&s;cious leer, and begged there might
be no rupture between the &s;pirit and the fle&s;h.
By this remon&s;trance, he relieved Obadiah from
the &s;atire of this female orator, and brought the
whole vengeance of her elocution upon his own
head. &startq;Fle&s;h: cried &s;he, with all the &s;erocity
of an enraged Thale&s;tris, none of your names,
Mr. Yellow-chaps. What! I warrant you have
an antipathy to fle&s;h, becau&s;e you your&s;elf are
nothing but &s;kin and bone. I &s;uppo&s;e you are
&s;ome poor &s;tarv'd journeyman taylor come from
France, where you have been learning to cab|bage,
and have not &s;een a good meal of victuals
the&s;e &s;even years; you have been living upon

rye-bread and &s;oup maigre, and now you come
over like a walking atomy, with a rat's tail at

you &s;et up for a gentleman, and pretend to find
fault with a &s;ur-loin of roa&s;t beef.&endq;</P>
<P>The gentleman heard this addre&s;s with admi|rable

alarm, very coolly replied. &startq;Any thing but
your &s;tinking fi&s;h, Madam. Since when, I
pray, have you travelled in &s;tage-coaches, and
left off your old profe&s;&s;ion of crying oy&s;ters in
winter, and rotten mackarel in June? You
was then known by the name of Kate Brawn,
and in good repute among the ale-hou&s;es in
Thames-&s;treet, till that unlucky amour with the

<P>The amazon, though neither exhau&s;ted nor
di&s;mayed, was really confounded at the temper
and a&s;&s;urance of this antagoni&s;t, who had ga|thered
all the&s;e anecdotes from the fertility of
his own invention; after a &s;hort pau&s;e, how|ever,
&s;he poured forth a torrent of obloquy &s;uf|ficient
to overwhelm any per&s;on who had not

not only di&s;graced the be&s;t orators on the Thames,
but even have made a figure in the celebration of
the Eleu&s;inian my&s;teries, during which the Athe|nian

happily pre&s;erved in this our age and country.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="213">
Such a redundancy of epithets and variety of
metaphors, tropes and figures were uttered between
the&s;e well-matched opponents, that an epic bard
would have found his account in li&s;tening to
the conte&s;t, which, in all probability, would not
have been confined to words; had it not been
interrupted for the &s;ake of a young woman of
an agreeable countenance and mode&s;t carriage;
who being &s;hocked at &s;ome of their flowers of
&s;peech, and terrified by the menacing looks and
ge&s;tures of the &s;irey featured dame, began to
&s;cream aloud, and beg leave to quit the coach.
Her perturbation put an end to the high debate.
The &s;ixth pa&s;&s;enger, who had not opened his
mouth, endeavoured to comfort her with a&s;&s;u|rances
of protection; the quaker propo&s;ed a ce&s;|&s;ation
of arms; the male di&s;putant acquie&s;ced in
the propo&s;al, a&s;&s;uring the company he had en|tered
the li&s;ts for their entertainment only, with|out
acquiring the lea&s;t grudge or ill-will to the
fat gentlewoman, whom he prote&s;ted he had
never &s;een before that day, and who, for aught
he knew, was a per&s;on of credit and reputation.
He then held forth his hand in token of amity,
and a&s;ked pardon of the offended party, who
was appea&s;ed by his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and in te&s;timony
of her benevolence, pre&s;ented to the other fe|male,

it as a much more powerful remedy,
than the Sal volatile, which the other held to
her no&s;e.</P>
<P>Peace being thus re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in a treaty,

will not be improper to give the reader &s;ome
further information touching the &s;everal charac|ters

a&s;&s;embled in this vehicle. The quaker was
a London merchant, who had been at Deal,
&s;uperintending the repairs of a &s;hip, which had
&s;uffered by a &s;torm in the Downs. The Wap|ping
landlady, was on her return from the &s;ame
place, where &s;he had attended the payment of a
man of war, with &s;undry powers of attorney,
granted by the &s;ailors, who had lived upon cre|dit
at her hou&s;e. Her competitor in fame was
a dealer in wine, a &s;muggler of French lace,
and a petty game&s;ter ju&s;t arrived from Paris, in
the company of an Engli&s;h barber who &s;at on
his right hand, and the young woman was
daughter of a country curate, in her way to
London, where &s;he was bound apprentice to a
milliner.</P>
<P>Hitherto Fathom had &s;at in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;h|ment
at the manners of his fellow-travellers,
which far exceeded the notions he had pre-con|ceived
of Engli&s;h plainne&s;s and ru&s;ticity: he
found him&s;elf a monument of that di&s;regard and
contempt, which a &s;tranger never fails to meet
with from the inhabitants of this i&s;land; and &s;aw
with &s;urprize, an agreeable young creature &s;it as
&s;olitary and unheeded as him&s;elf. He was, indeed,
allured by the ro&s;es of her complexion, and the
innocence of her a&s;pect, and began to repent of
having pretended ignorance of the language, by
which he was re&s;trained from exerci&s;ing his elo|quence
upon her heart; he re&s;olved, however,
to ingratiate him&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible, by the cour|te&s;y
and politene&s;s of dumb &s;hew, and for that
purpo&s;e, put his eyes in motion without farther
delay.</P>

<P>DUring the&s;e deliberations, the wine-mer|chant,
with a view to make a parade of
his &s;uperior parts and breeding, as well as to pave
the way for a match at backgammon, made a ten|der
of his &s;nuff-box to our adventurer, and a&s;ked
in bad French, how he travelled from Paris.
This que&s;tion produced a &s;eries of interrogations,
concerning the place of Ferdinand's abode in

he was was fain to practi&s;e the &s;cience of de|fence,

to believe our hero had &s;ome very cogent rea|&s;on,
for evading his curio&s;ity: he immediately
&s;et his reflection at work, and after various con|jectures,
fixed upon Fathom's being the young
pretender. Big with this &s;uppo&s;ition, he eyed
him with the mo&s;t earne&s;t attention, comparing
his features with tho&s;e of the chevalier's portrait,
which he had &s;een in France, and though the
faces were as unlike as any two human faces
could be, found the re&s;emblance &s;o &s;triking as

the &s;tranger to &s;ome Ju&s;tice on the road:
a &s;tep by which he would not only manife&s;t his

the &s;piendid reward propo&s;ed by parliament,

<P><PB N="207" REF="216">
The&s;e ideas intoxicated the brain of this man,

of that acqui&s;ition; until his reverie was inter|rupted
by the halting of the coach at the inn
where the pa&s;&s;engers u&s;ed to eat their breakfa&s;ts.

<P>Our hero, who&s;e &s;agacity and pre&s;ence of

to the &s;ummons of the wine-merchant. The
re&s;t of the company were &s;truck dumb with
&s;urprize and con&s;ternation at this &s;udden adven|ture,
and the quaker dreading &s;ome fell re&s;i&s;t|ance
on the &s;ide of the outlandi&s;h-man, unpinned
the other coach door in the twinkling of an eye,
and trundled him&s;elf into the mud for &s;afety.
The others &s;eeing the temper and re&s;ignation of
the pri&s;oner, &s;oon recovered their recollection,
and began to inquire into the cau&s;e of his arre&s;t:
<PB N="208" REF="217">
Upon which the captor, who&s;e teeth chattered
with terror and impatience, gave them to un|der&s;tand
that he was a &s;tate criminal, and
demanded their help in conveying him to
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Luckily for both parties, there happened to be
at the inn a company of &s;quires ju&s;t returned
from the death of a lea&s;h of hares, which they
had ordered to be dre&s;&s;ed for dinner, and among
the&s;e gentlemen was one of the Quorum, to whom
the accu&s;er had immediate recour&s;e, marching
before the captive, who walked very peaceably
between the landlord and one of his waiters,
and followed by a croud of &s;pectators, &s;ome of
whom had &s;ecured the faithful Maurice, who in
his behaviour, clo&s;ely imitated the deliberation
of his ma&s;ter. In this order did the proce&s;&s;ion
advance to the apartment in which the magi|&s;trate
with his fellows of the chace, fat &s;moak|ing
his morning pipe over a tankard of &s;trong+ale;
and the &s;muggler being directed to the right
per&s;on, &startq;May it plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, &s;aid he,
I have brought this foreigner before you, on a
violent &s;u&s;picion of his being a proclaimed out|law,
and I de&s;ire before the&s;e witne&s;&s;es, that
my title may be made good to the reward that
&s;hall become due upon his conviction.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Friend, replied the ju&s;tice, I know no|thing
of you or your titles, but, this I know,
if you have any information to give in, you
mu&s;t come to my hou&s;e when I am at home,
and proceed in a lawful way, that is, d'ye mind
me, if you &s;wear as how this here per&s;on is an
outlaw, then if &s;o be as he has nothing to &s;ay
to the contrary, my clerk &s;hall make out a mit|timus;
and &s;o to jail with him till next &s;ize.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="218">
&startq;But Sir,&endq; an&s;wered the impeacher, this is a
ca&s;e that admits of no delay, the per&s;on I have
apprehended, is a pri&s;oner of con&s;equence to the
&s;tate.&endq; &startq;How! fellor,&endq; cried the magi&s;trate,
interrupting him, &startq;is there any per&s;on of more
con&s;equence than one of his maje&s;ty's ju&s;tices
of the peace, who is be&s;ides, a con&s;iderable
member of the landed intere&s;t? d'ye know &s;irrah,
who you are talking to? if you don't go about
your bu&s;ine&s;s, I believe I &s;hall lay you by the
heels.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;muggler fearing his prize would e&s;cape,
through the ignorance, pride and ob&s;tinacy of
this country ju&s;tice, approached his wor&s;hip,
and in a whi&s;per, which was overheard by all
the company, a&s;&s;ured him, he had indubitable
rea&s;on to believe the foreigner was no other than
the pretender's elde&s;t &s;on. At mention of this
formidable name, every individual of the audi|ence
&s;tarted, with &s;igns of terror and amaze|ment.
The ju&s;tice dropped his pipe, recoiled
upon his chair, and looking mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly
agha&s;t, exclaimed, &startq;Seize him in the name
of God and his maje&s;ty king George! has he
got no &s;ecret arms about him?&endq;</P>
<P>Fathom being thus informed of the &s;u&s;picion
under which he &s;tood, could not help &s;miling
at the eagerne&s;s with which the &s;pectators flew
upon him; and &s;uffered him&s;elf to be &s;earched
with great compo&s;ure, well knowing they would
find no moveables about his per&s;on, but &s;uch as
upon examination, would turn to his account;
he, therefore, very calmly pre&s;ented to the ma|gi&s;trate
his pur&s;e, and a &s;mall box that contain|ed
his jewels, and in the French language, de|&s;ired
they might be pre&s;erved from the hands of
<PB N="210" REF="219">
the mob. This reque&s;t was interpreted by the
accu&s;er, who at the &s;ame time, laid claim to the
booty; the ju&s;tice took charge of the depo&s;it,
and one of his neighbours having undertaken the
office of clerk, he proceeded to the examination
of the culprit, who&s;e papers were by this time
laid on the table before him. &startq;Stranger, &s;aid
he, you &s;tand charged with being &s;on of the
pretender to the&s;e realms: what have you to &s;ay
in your own defence?&endq; Our hero a&s;&s;ured him
in the French language that he was fal&s;ly im|peached,
and demanded ju&s;tice on the accu&s;er,
who without the lea&s;t rea&s;on, had made &s;uch a
malicious attack upon the life and honour of an
innocent gentleman.</P>
<P>The &s;muggler, in&s;tead of acting the part of a
faithful interpreter, told his wor&s;hip that the
pri&s;oner's an&s;wer was no more than a &s;imple de|nial,
which every felon would make, who had
nothing el&s;e to plead in his own behalf; and that
this alone was a &s;trong pre&s;umption of his guilt;
becau&s;e, if he was not really the per&s;on they &s;u&s;|pected
him to be, the thing would &s;peak for it|&s;elf:
for, if he was not the young pretender,
who then was he?&endq; This argument had great
weight with the ju&s;tice, who a&s;&s;uming a very
important a&s;pect, ob&s;erved, &startq;Very true, friend,
if you are not the pretender, in the name of
God who are you? one may &s;ee with half an
eye, that he is no better than a promi&s;cuous
fellow.&endq;</P>
<P>Ferdinand now began to repent of having
pretended ignorance of the Engli&s;h language,
as he found him&s;elf at the mercy of a ra&s;cal,
who put a fal&s;e glo&s;s upon all his words; and
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the audience &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in
<PB N="211" REF="220">
French, High-Dutch, Italian, and Hungarian
Latin, de&s;iring to know if any per&s;on pre&s;ent
under&s;tood any of the&s;e tongues, that his an&s;wers
might be hone&s;tly explained to the bench. But,
he might have acco&s;ted them in Chine&s;e with
the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s: there was not one per&s;on pre|&s;ent
tolerably ver&s;ed in his mother tongue, much
le&s;s acquainted with any foreign language, ex|cept
the wine-merchant, who incen&s;ed at this
appeal, which he con&s;idered as an affront to his
integrity, gave the judge to under&s;tand that the
delinquent, in&s;tead of &s;peaking to the purpo&s;e,
contumaciou&s;ly in&s;ulted his authority, in &s;undry
foreign lingo's, which he apprehended, was an
additional proof of his being the chevalier's &s;on,
ina&s;much, as no per&s;on would take the pains to
learn &s;uch a variety of gibberi&s;h, except with &s;ome
fini&s;ter intent.</P>
<P>This annotation was not lo&s;t upon the &s;quire,
who was too jealous of the honour of his office,
to overlook &s;uch a flagrant in&s;tance of contempt.
His eyes gli&s;tened, his cheeks were inflated with
rage: &startq;The ca&s;e is plain,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;having
nothing of &s;ignification to offer in his own fa|vour,
he grows refectory, and abu&s;es the court
in his ba&s;e Roman catholic jargon: but I'll let
you know, for all you pretend to be a prince,
you are no better than an outlawed vagrant; and
I'll &s;hew you what a thing you are, when you
come in compo&s;ition with an Engli&s;h ju&s;tice like
me, who have more than once extingui&s;hed my|&s;elf
in the &s;ervice of my country. As nothing
el&s;e accrues, your pur&s;e, black box and papers
&s;hall be &s;ealed up before witne&s;&s;es, and &s;ent by
expre&s;s to one of his maje&s;ty's &s;ecretaries of
&s;tate; and as for your&s;elf, I will apply to the
<PB N="212" REF="221">
military at Canterbury, for a guard to conduct
you to London.&endq;</P>
<P>This was a very unwelcome declaration to
our adventurer, who was on the point of har|ranguing
the ju&s;tice and &s;pectators in their own
language, when he was relieved from the nece&s;|&s;ity
of taking that &s;tep, by the interpo&s;ition of a
young nobleman ju&s;t arrived at the inn, who
being informed of this &s;trange examination, en|tered
the court, and at fir&s;t &s;ight of the pri&s;oner,
a&s;&s;ured the ju&s;tice he was impo&s;ed upon; for,
that he him&s;elf had often &s;een the young Pre|tender
in Paris, and that there was no kind of
re&s;emblance between that adventurer and the
per&s;on now before him. The accu&s;er was not
a little mortified at his lord&s;hip's affirmation,
which met with all due regard from the bench;
though the magi&s;trate took notice that granting
the pri&s;oner was not the young chevalier him|&s;elf,
it was highly probable, he was an emi&s;&s;ary
of that hou&s;e, as he could give no &s;atisfactory
account of him&s;elf, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of things
of &s;uch value as no hone&s;t man would expo&s;e to
the accidents of the road.</P>
<P>Fathom having thus found an interpreter, who
&s;ignified to him in the French tongue, the doubts
of the ju&s;tice, told his lord&s;hip that he was a
gentleman of a noble hou&s;e in Germany, who
for certain rea&s;ons, had come abroad incognito,
with a view to &s;ee the world; and that although
the letters they had &s;ei&s;ed, would prove the
truth of that a&s;&s;ertion, he &s;hould be loth to ex|po&s;e
his private concerns to the knowledge of
&s;trangers, if he could po&s;&s;ibly be relea&s;ed with|out
that mortification. The young nobleman
explained his de&s;ire to the court; but, his own
<PB N="213" REF="222">
curio&s;ity being intere&s;ted, ob&s;erved at the &s;ame
time, that the ju&s;tice could not be &s;aid to have
di&s;charged the duty of his &s;tation, until he &s;hould
have examined every circum&s;tance relating to
the pri&s;oner: upon which remon&s;trance, he was
reque&s;ted by the bench to peru&s;e the papers, and
accordingly communicated the &s;ub&s;tance of one
letter, to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>&startq;My dear &s;on,</OPENER>
<P>Though I am far from approving the ra&s;h
&s;tep you have taken in withdrawing your&s;elf

hard&s;hips, which for your di&s;obedience, you
de&s;erve to &s;uffer. I have therefore, without
the knowledge of your father, &s;ent the bearer
to attend you in your peregrinations; his fide|lity
you know hath been tried in a long cour&s;e
of &s;ervice, and I have entru&s;ted to his care
for your u&s;e, a pur&s;e of two hundred ducats,
and a box of jewels to the value of twice that
&s;um, which though not &s;ufficient to &s;upport
an equipage &s;uitable to your birth, will, at
lea&s;t for &s;ome time, pre&s;erve you from the
importunities of want. When you are du|tiful
enough to explain your de&s;igns and &s;itua|tion,
you may expect further indulgence from
your too tender and di&s;con&s;olate mother,</P>
<CLOSER>The counte&s;s of Fathom.&endq;</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="214" REF="223">
This letter, which, as well as the others, our
hero had forged for the purpo&s;e, effectually an|&s;wered
his intent, in throwing du&s;t in the eyes
and under&s;tanding of the &s;pectators, who now
regarded the pri&s;oner with looks of re&s;pectful re|mor&s;e,
as a man of quality who had been fal&s;ly
accu&s;ed: his lord&s;hip to make a parade of his
own politene&s;s and importance, a&s;&s;ured the
bench, he was no &s;tranger to the family of the
Fathoms, and with a compliment, gave Ferdi|nand
to under&s;tand he had formerly &s;een him at
Ver&s;ailles. There being no longer room for
&s;u&s;picion, the ju&s;tice ordered our adventurer to
be &s;et at liberty, and even invited him to be &s;eated,
with an apology for the rude manner in which
he had been treated, owing to the mi&s;informa|tion
of the accu&s;er, who was threatned with the
&s;tocks for his malice and pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>But, this was not the only triumph our hero
obtained over the wine-merchant. Maurice was
no &s;ooner unfettered, than advancing into the
middle of the room; &startq;My lord, (&s;aid he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf in French, to his ma&s;ter's deli|verer,)
&s;ince you have been &s;o generous as to
protect a noble &s;tranger from the danger of &s;uch
a fal&s;e accu&s;ation, I hope you will &s;till lay an
additional obligation upon the count, by retort|ing
the vengeance of the law upon his perfidious
accu&s;er, whom I know to be a trader in tho&s;e
articles of merchandize, which are prohibited by
the ordonnances of this nation. I have &s;een
him lately at Bullogne, and am perfectly well
acquainted with &s;ome per&s;ons who have &s;upplied
him with French lace and embroidery; and as
a proof of what I alledge, I de&s;ire you will or|der
<PB N="215" REF="224">
him and this barber, who is his under&s;trap|per,
to be examined on the &s;pot.&endq;</P>
<P>This charge, which was immediately explain|ed
to the bench, yielded extraordinary &s;atisfaction
to the &s;pectators, one of whom, being an officer
of the cu&s;toms, forthwith began to exerci&s;e his
function upon the unlucky Perruquier, who be|ing
&s;tripped of his upper garments, and even of
his &s;hirt, appeared like the mummy of an Aegyp|tian
king, mo&s;t curiou&s;ly rolled up in bandages
of rich, figured gold &s;halloon, that covered the
&s;kirts of four embroidered wai&s;tcoats. The
merchant &s;eeing his expectation &s;o unhappily re|ver&s;ed,
made an effort to retire with a mo&s;t rue|&s;ul
a&s;pect; but was prevented by the officer, who
demanded the interpo&s;ition of the civil power,
that he might undergo the &s;ame examination,
to which the other had been &s;ubjected. He
was accordingly rifled without lo&s;s of time, and
the enquiry proved well worth the care of him
who made it; for, a con&s;iderable booty of the
&s;ame &s;ort of merchandize was found in his boots,
breeches, hat, and between the buckram and
lining of his &s;urtout. Yet not contented with
this prize, the experienced &s;poiler proceeded to
&s;earch his baggage, and perceiving a fal&s;e bot|tom
in his portmanteau, detected beneath it a
valuable acce&s;&s;ion to the plunder he had already
obtained.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The &s;ingular manner of Fathom's attack and tri|umph
over the virtue of the fair Elenor.</HEAD>
<P>PRoper cognizance being thus taken of the&s;e
contraband effects, and the informer fur|ni&s;hed
with a certificate by which he was intitled
to a &s;hare of the &s;eizure, the coachman &s;um|moned
his pa&s;&s;engers to the carriage; the pur&s;e
and jewels were re&s;tored to count Fathom, who
thanked the ju&s;tice, and his lord&s;hip in particular,
for the candour and ho&s;pitality with which he
had been treated, and re&s;umed his place in the
vehicle, amid&s;t the congratulations of all his fel|low
travellers, except the two &s;orlorn &s;mugglers,
who in&s;tead of reimbarking in the coach, thought
proper to remain at the inn, with a view to mi|tigate,
if po&s;&s;ible, the &s;everity of their mi&s;|fortune.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who felicitated Fathom upon
the i&s;&s;ue of this adventure, the young maiden
&s;eemed to expre&s;s the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure at
that event. The artful language of his eyes had
rai&s;ed in her brea&s;t certain fluttering emotions,
before &s;he knew the value of her conque&s;t; but
now that his rank and condition were di&s;covered,
the&s;e tran&s;ports were increa&s;ed by the ideas of
vanity and ambition which are mingled with the
fir&s;t &s;eeds of every female con&s;titution. The
belief of having captivated the heart of a man
who could rai&s;e her to the rank and dignity of a
counte&s;s, produced &s;uch agreeable &s;en&s;ations in
her fancy, that her eyes &s;hone with unu&s;ual lu&s;tre,
and a continual &s;mile played in dimples, on her
<PB N="217" REF="226">
ro&s;y cheeks; &s;o that her attractions, though not
powerful enough to engage the affection, were
yet &s;ufficient to inflame the de&s;ire of our adven|turer,
who very hone&s;tly marked her cha&s;tity
for prey to his voluptuous pa&s;&s;ion. Had &s;he
been well &s;ea&s;oned with knowledge and experi|ence,
and compleatly armed with caution again&s;t
the artifice and villainy of man, her virtue
might not have been able to with&s;tand the en|gines
of &s;uch an a&s;&s;ailant, con&s;idering the
dangerous opportunities to which &s;he was ne|ce&s;&s;arily
expo&s;ed: how ea&s;y then mu&s;t his victory
have been over an innocent, un&s;u&s;pecting coun|try
dam&s;el, flu&s;hed with the warmth of youth,
and an utter &s;tranger to the ways of life.</P>
<P>While Obadiah, therefore, and his plump
companion were engaged in conver&s;ation, on
the &s;trange incidents which had pa&s;&s;ed, Fathom
acted a very expre&s;&s;ive pantomime with this fair
buxom nymph, who comprehended his meaning
with &s;urprizing facility, and was at &s;o little pains
to conceal the plea&s;ure the took in this kind of
intercour&s;e, that &s;everal warm &s;queezes were in|terchanged
between her and her lover, before they
arrived at Roche&s;ter, where they propo&s;ed to dine.
It was during this period, he learned from the
an&s;wers &s;he made to the inqui&s;itive quaker, that
her &s;ole dependance was upon a relation, to
whom &s;he had a letter, and that &s;he was a per|fect
&s;tranger in the great city; circum&s;tances
on which he &s;oon formed the project of her
ruin.</P>
<P>Upon their arrival at the Black Bull, he for
the fir&s;t time found him&s;elf alone with his Aman|da,
who&s;e name was Elenor, their fellow-tra|vellers
being el&s;ewhere employed about their own
<PB N="218" REF="227">
concerns; and unwilling to lo&s;e the precious
opportunity, he began to act the part of a very im|portunate
lover, which he conceived to be a
proper &s;equel to the prelude, which had been
performed in the coach. The freedoms that
&s;he, out of pure &s;implicity and good humour,
permitted him to take with her hand, and even
her ro&s;y lips, encouraged him to practi&s;e other
familiarities upon her fair bo&s;om, which &s;canda|lized
her virtue &s;o much, that in &s;pite of the
pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had begun to indulge in his behalf,
&s;he rejected his advances with all the marks of
anger and di&s;dain; and he found it nece&s;&s;ary to
appea&s;e the &s;torm he had rai&s;ed, by the mo&s;t
re&s;pectful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive demeanour; re&s;olving
to change his operations, and carry on his at|tacks,
&s;o as to make her yield at di&s;cretion,
without alarming her religion or pride. Ac|cordingly,
when the bill was called after dinner,
he took particular notice of her behaviour, and
perceiving her pull out a large leathern pur&s;e
that contained her money, reconnoitred the
pocket in which it was depo&s;ited, and while they
&s;at clo&s;e to each other in the carriage, conveyed
it with admirable dexterity into an hole in the
cu&s;hion. Whether the corpulent couple, who
&s;at oppo&s;ite to the&s;e lovers, had entered into an
amorous engagement at the inn, or were &s;eve|rally
induced by other motives, is uncertain;
but, &s;ure it is, both left the coach on that part
of the road which lies neare&s;t to Grave&s;end,
and bad adieu to the other pair, on pretence of
having urgent bu&s;ine&s;s at that place.</P>
<P>Ferdinand, not a little plea&s;ed at their depar|ture,
renewed his mo&s;t pathetic expre&s;&s;ions of
love, and &s;ung &s;everal French &s;ongs on that ten|der
<PB N="219" REF="228">
&s;ubject, which &s;eemed to thrill to the &s;o I of
his beauteous Helen. While the driver halted
at Dartford to water his hor&s;es, &s;he was fruit
with the appearance of &s;ome chee&s;ecakes, which
were pre&s;ented by the landlady of the hou&s;e,
and having bargained for two or three, put her
hand in her pocket, in order to pay for her pur|cha&s;e;
but what was her a&s;toni&s;hment, when af|ter
having rummaged her equipage, &s;he under|&s;tood
her whole fortune was lo&s;t! This mi|&s;hap
was by a loud &s;hriek announced to our hero,
who affected infinite amazement and concern;
and no &s;ooner learned the cau&s;e of her affliction,
than he pre&s;ented her with his own pur&s;e, from
which he, in emphatic dumb &s;hew, begged &s;he
would indemnify her&s;elf for the damage &s;he had
&s;u&s;tained. Although this kind proffer was &s;ome
alleviation of her misfortune, &s;he did not fail to
pour forth a mo&s;t piteous lamentation, importing
that &s;he had not only lo&s;t all her money, amount|ing
to five pounds, but al&s;o her letter of recom|mendation
upon which &s;he had altogether relied
for pre&s;ent employment.</P>
<P>The vehicle was minutely &s;earched from top
to bottom, by her&s;elf and our adventurer, a&s;li&s;t|ed
by Maurice, and the coachman, who finding
their inquiry ineffectual, did not &s;cruple to de|clare
his &s;u&s;picion of the two fat turtles who
had de&s;erted the coach in &s;uch an abrupt man|ner.
In a word, he rendered this conjecture &s;o
plau&s;ible, by wre&s;ting the circum&s;tances of their
behaviour and retreat, that poor Elenor impli|citly
believed they were the thieves by whom
&s;he had &s;uffered; and was prevailed upon to ac|cept
the proffered a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the generous
count, who &s;eeing her very much di&s;ordered by
<PB N="220" REF="229">
this mi&s;chance, in&s;i&s;ted upon her drinking a large
gla&s;s of Canary to quiet the perturbation of her
&s;pirits. This is a &s;ea&s;on, which of all others, is
mo&s;t propitious to the attempts of an artful lover;
and ju&s;tifies the metaphorical maxim of fi&s;hing
in troubled waters. There is an affinity and
&s;hort tran&s;ition betwixt all the violent pa&s;&s;ions
that agitate the human mind: they are all fal&s;e
per&s;pectives, which though they magnify, yet
perplex and render indi&s;tinct every object which
they repre&s;ent: and flattery is never &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|fully
admini&s;tred, as to tho&s;e who know they
&s;tand in need of friend&s;hip, a&s;&s;ent and appro|bation.</P>
<P>The cordial &s;he &s;wallowed, far &s;rem calming,
increa&s;ed the di&s;turbance of her thoughts, and
produced an intoxication; during which, &s;he
talked in an incoherent &s;train, laughed and wept
by turns, and acted other extravagancies, which
are known to be &s;ymptoms of the hy&s;terical
affection. Fathom, though an utter &s;tranger to
the &s;entiments of honour, pity and remor&s;e,
would not perpetrate his vitious purpo&s;e, though
favoured by the delirium his villainy had intailed
upon this unfortunate young maiden; becau&s;e
his appetite demanded a more perfect &s;acrifice,
than that which &s;he could yield in her pre&s;ent
deplorable &s;ituation, when her will mu&s;t have
been altogether unconcerned in his &s;ucce&s;s.
Determined therefore, to make a conque&s;t of
her virtue, before he would take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
her per&s;on, he mimicked that compa&s;&s;ion and be|nevolence,
which his heart had never felt, and
when the coach arrived at London, not only
di&s;charged what &s;he owed for her place, but like
wi&s;e, procured for her an apartment in the
<PB N="221" REF="230">
hou&s;e, to which he him&s;elf had been directed
for lodgings, and even hired a nur&s;e to attend
her, during a &s;evere &s;ever, which was the con|&s;equence
of her di&s;appointment and de&s;pondence.
Indeed &s;he was &s;upplied with all nece&s;&s;aries by
the genero&s;ity of this noble count, who for the
intere&s;t of his pa&s;&s;ion, and the honour of his
name, was re&s;olved to extend his charity to the
la&s;t farthing of her own money, which he had
been wi&s;e enough to &s;ecure for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Her youth &s;oon got the better of her di&s;tem|per,
and when &s;he under&s;tood her obligations to
the count, who did not fail to attend her in
per&s;on with great tenderne&s;s, her heart, which
had been before prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his favour, now
glowed with all the warmth of gratitude, e&s;teem
and affection. She knew her&s;elf in a &s;trange
place, de&s;titute of all re&s;ource but in his gene|ro&s;ity:
&s;he loved his per&s;on, &s;he was dazzled by
his rank; and he knew &s;o well how to improve
the opportunities and advantages he derived from
her unhappy &s;ituation, that he gradually pro|ceeded
in &s;apping from one degree of intimacy
to another, until all the bulwarks of her cha&s;tity
were undermined, and &s;he &s;ubmitted to his de|&s;ire;
not with the reluctance of a vanqui&s;hed
people, but with all the tran&s;ports of a joyful
city, that opens its gates to receive a darling
prince, returned from conque&s;t: for, by this
time, he had artfully concentred and kindled up,
all the inflammable ingredients of her con&s;titu|tion;
and &s;he now looked back upon the vir|tuous
principles of her education, as upon a
di&s;agreeable and tedious dream, from which &s;he
had waked to the fruition of never-fading joy.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He by accident encounters his old friend, with
whom be holds a conference, and renews a
treaty.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Hero having thus provided him|&s;elf
with a proper &s;ubject for his hours
of dalliance, thought it was now high
time to &s;tudy the ground which he had
pitched upon for the &s;cene of his exploits,
and with that view made &s;everal excur&s;ions to
different parts of the town, where there was
ought of entertainment or in&s;truction to be
found: yet he always, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, ap|peared
in an ob&s;cure ordinary dre&s;s, in order to
avoid &s;ingularity, and never went twice to the
&s;ame coffee-hou&s;e, that his per&s;on might not be
afterwards known, in ca&s;e he &s;hould &s;hine forth
to the public, in a &s;uperior &s;phere. On his re|turn
from one of the&s;e expeditions, while he
was pa&s;&s;ing through Ludgate, his eyes were
&s;uddenly encountered, by the apparition of his
old friend the Tyroleze, who perceiving him&s;elf
fairly caught in the toil, made a virtue of ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
and running up to our adventurer with
an a&s;pect of eagerne&s;s and joy, cla&s;ped him in
his arms, as &s;ome dear friend, whom he had
ca&s;ually found after a mo&s;t tedious and di&s;agree|able
&s;eparation.</P>
<P>Fathom, who&s;e genius never failed him in &s;uch
emergencies, far from receiving the&s;e advances
with the threats and reproaches which the other
had de&s;erved at his hands, returned the &s;alute
with equal warmth, and was really over-joyed
<PB N="223" REF="232">
at meeting with a per&s;on, who might one way
or other make amends for the perfidy of his
former conduct. The Tyroleze, who&s;e name
was Ratchkali, plea&s;ed with his reception, pro|po&s;ed
they &s;hould adjourn to the next tavern,
in which they had no &s;ooner taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
an apartment, than he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his
old companion in the&s;e words.</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. Fathom, by your frank and obliging
manner of treating a man who hath done you
wrong, I am more and more confirmed in my
opinion of your &s;agacity, which I have often
con&s;idered with admiration: I will not therefore,
attempt to make an apology for my conduct at
our la&s;t parting; but only a&s;&s;ure you that this
meeting may turn out to our mutual advantage,
if we now re-enter into an unre&s;erved union,
the ties of which we will &s;oon find it our inte|re&s;t
and inclination to pre&s;erve. For my own
part, as my judgment is ripened by experience, &s;o
are my &s;entiments changed &s;ince our la&s;t a&s;&s;ocia|tion.
I have &s;een many a rich harve&s;t lo&s;t, for
want of a fellow-labourer in the vineyard; and
I have more than once fallen a &s;acrifice to a
combination, which I could have re&s;i&s;ted with
the help of one able auxiliary. Indeed I might
prove what I alledge by mathematical demon|&s;tration;
and I believe no body will pretend to
deny, that two heads are better than one, in
all ca&s;es that require di&s;cernment and delibe|ration.&endq;</P>
<P>Ferdinand could not help owning the &s;anity of
his ob&s;ervations, and forthwith acquie&s;ced in his
propo&s;al of the new alliance; de&s;iring to know
the character in which he acted in the Engli&s;h
&s;tage, and the &s;cheme he would offer for their
<PB N="224" REF="233">
mutual emolument: at the &s;ame time he re&s;olved
within him&s;elf, to keep &s;uch a &s;trict eye over
his future actions, as would fru&s;trate any de&s;ign,
he might hereafter harbour, of repeating the
prank he had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully played upon him, in
their journey from the banks of the Rhine.</P>
<P>&startq;Having quitted you at Bar le duc, re&s;umed
the Tyroleze, I travelled without cea&s;ing, until
I arrived at Franck&s;ort upon the Maine, where
I a&s;&s;umed the character of a French chevalier,
and &s;truck &s;ome ma&s;terly &s;trokes, which you
your&s;elf would not have deemed unworthy of
your invention; and my &s;ucce&s;s was the more
agreeable, as my operations were chiefly carried
on again&s;t the enemies of our religion: but my
pro&s;perity was not of long duration. Seeing
they could not foil me at my own weapons, they
formed a damned con&s;piracy, by which I not
only lo&s;t all the fruits of my indu&s;try, but like|wi&s;e
ran the mo&s;t imminent hazard of my life.
I had ordered &s;ome of tho&s;e jewels which I had
borrowed of my good friend Fathom, to be new
&s;et in a fa&s;hionable ta&s;te, and &s;oon after had an
opportunity to &s;ell one of the&s;e at a great advan|tage,
to one of the fraternity, who offered an
extraordinary price for the &s;tone, on purpo&s;e to
effect my r$in. In le&s;s than four and twenty
hours after this bargain, I was arre&s;ted by the
officers of ju&s;tice, upon the oath of the pur|cha&s;er,
who undertook to prove me guilty of a
fraud, in &s;elling a Saxon pebble for a real dia|mond;
and this accu&s;ation was actually true;
for the change had been artfully put upon me,
by the jeweller, who was him&s;elf engaged in
the con&s;piracy.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="234">
Had my con&s;cience been clear of any other
impeachment, perhaps, I &s;hould have re&s;ted my
cau&s;e upon the equity and protection of the law;
but, I fore&s;aw that the trial would introduce
an inquiry, to which I was not at all ambitious
of &s;ubmitting, and therefore was fain to com|promi&s;e
the affair, at the price of almo&s;t my
whole fortune. Yet, this accommodation was
not made &s;o &s;ecretly, but that my character was
bla&s;ted, and my credit overthrown; &s;o that I
was fain to relinqui&s;h my occa&s;ional equipage,
and hire my&s;elf as journeyman to a lapidary,
an employment which I had exerci&s;ed in my
youth. In this ob&s;cure &s;tation, I laboured with
great a&s;&s;iduity, until I made my&s;elf perfect in
the knowledge of &s;tones, as well as in the diffe|rent
methods of &s;etting them off to the be&s;t ad|vantage;
and having, by dint of indu&s;try and
addre&s;s, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;mall parcel, &s;et out
for this kingdom, in which I happily arrived
about four months ago; and &s;urely England is
the paradi&s;e of arti&s;ts of our profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>One would imagine, that nature had created
the inhabitants, for the &s;upport and enjoyment of
adventurers like you and me. Not that the&s;e
i&s;landers open the arms of ho&s;pitality to all
foreigners without di&s;tinction: on the contrary,
they inherit from their fathers, an unrea&s;onable
prejudice again&s;t all nations under the &s;un; and
when an Engli&s;hman happens to quarrel with a
&s;tranger, the fir&s;t term of reproach he u&s;es, is
the name of his antagoni&s;t's country, charac|terized
by &s;ome opprobrious epithet; &s;uch as a
chattering Frenchman, an Italian ape, a German
hog, and a bea&s;tly Dutchman; nay, their national
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is maintained even again&s;t tho&s;e
<PB N="226" REF="235">
people with whom they are united, under the
&s;ame laws and government; for, nothing is
more common th$$ to hear them exclaim again&s;t
their fellow &s;ubjects, in the expre&s;&s;ions of a beg|garly
Scot, and an impudent Iri&s;h bog-trotter.
Yet, this very prejudice will never fail to turn
to the account of every &s;tranger po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of or|dinary
talents; for he will always find opportu|nities
of conver&s;ing with them in Coffee-hou&s;es,
and places of public re&s;ort, in &s;pite of their
pro&s;e&s;&s;ed re&s;erve, which, by the bye, is &s;o ex|traordinary,
that I know &s;ome people who have
lived twenty years in the &s;ame hou&s;e, without
exchanging one word with their next door
neighbours; yet, provided he can talk &s;en&s;ibly,
and pre&s;erve the deportment of a &s;ober gentle|man,
in tho&s;e occa&s;ional conver&s;ations, his beha|viour
will be the more remarkably plea&s;ing, as it
will agreeably di&s;appoint the expectation of the
per&s;on, who had entertained notions to his
prejudice. When a foreigner has once cro&s;&s;ed
this bar, which perpetually occurs, he fails with|out
further difficulty into the harbour of an
Engli&s;hman's good will; for the pique is neither
per&s;onal nor rancorous, but rather contemptu|ous
and national; &s;o that while he de&s;pifes a
people in the lump, an individual of that very
community, may be one of his chief fa|vourites.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h are in general upright and ho|ne&s;t,
therefore un&s;u&s;pecting and credulous: they
are too much engro&s;&s;ed with their own bu&s;ine&s;s,
to pry into the conduct of their neighbours,
and too indifferent, in point of di&s;po&s;ition, to
intere&s;t them&s;elves, in what they conceive to be
foreign to their own concerns. They are
<PB N="227" REF="236">
wealthy and mercantile, of con&s;equence liberal
and adventurous, and &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to take a
man's own word for his importance, that they
&s;uffer them&s;elves to be preyed upon by &s;uch a
bungling &s;et of impo&s;tors, as would &s;tarve for
lack of addre&s;s, in any other country under the
&s;un. This being a true &s;ketch of the Briti&s;h
character, &s;o far as I have been able to ob&s;erve
and learn, you will ea&s;ily comprehend the profits
that may be extracted from it, by virtue of tho&s;e
arts by which you &s;o eminently excel; <HI>the great
the unbounded pro&s;pect lies before me!</HI> Indeed, I
look upon this opulent kingdom, as a wide and
fertile common, on which we adventurers may
range for prey, without let or mole&s;tation: for
&s;o jealous are the natives of their liberty, that
they will not bear the re&s;traint of nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Po|lice,</HI>
and an able arti&s;t may enrich him&s;elf with
their &s;poils, without running any ri&s;que of at|tracting
the notice of the magi&s;trate, or incur|ing
the lea&s;t penalty of the law.</P>
<P>In a word, this metropolis is a va&s;t ma&s;querad$,
in which a man of &s;tratagem may wear a thou|&s;and
different di&s;gui&s;es, without danger of de|tection.
There is a variety of &s;hapes, in which
we knights of the indu&s;try, make our appearance
in London. One glides into a nobleman's hou&s;e
in the capacity of a valet de chambre, and in a
few months lea$s the whole family by the no&s;e.
Another exhibits him&s;elf to the public, as an
empirie or operator for the teeth; and by din$
of a&s;&s;urance and affidavits, bearing te&s;timony to
wonderful cures that never were performed,
whirls him&s;elf into his chariot, and lays the
town under contribution: a third profe&s;&s;es the
compo&s;ition of mu&s;ick, as well as the perform|ance,
<PB N="228" REF="237">
and by means of a few <HI>Capricio&s;os</HI> on the
violin, properly introduced, wriggles him&s;elf into
the management of private and public concerts:
and a fourth breaks forth at once in all the &s;plen|dor
of a gay equipage, under the title and deno|mination
of a foreign count. Not to mention
tho&s;e inferior projectors, who a&s;&s;ume the cha|racters
of dancers, fencing-ma&s;ters, and French
u&s;hers, or by renouncing their religion, &s;eek to
obtain a provi&s;ion for life.</P>
<P>Either of the&s;e parts will turn to the account
of an able actor; and as you are equally quali|fied
for all, you may choo&s;e that which is mo&s;t
&s;uitable to your own inclination: though in my
opinion, you was de&s;igned by nature, to &s;hine
in the great world, which, after all, is the mo&s;t
ample field, for men of genius; becau&s;e the
game is deeper, and people of fa&s;hion being,
for the mo&s;t part, more ignorant, indolent,
vain and capricious than their inferiors, are of
con&s;equence more ea&s;ily deceived; be&s;ides their
morals fit generally &s;o loo&s;e about them, that
when a gentleman of our fraternity is di&s;covered
in the exerci&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion, their contempt
of his &s;kill is the only di&s;grace he incurs.&endq;</P>
<P>Our hero was &s;o well plea&s;ed with this pic|ture,
that he longed to peru&s;e the original, and
before the&s;e two friends parted, they &s;ettled all
the operations of the campaign. Ratchkali,
that &s;ame evening, hired magnificent lodgings
for count Fathom, in the court end of the
town, and furni&s;hed his wardrobe and liveries
from the &s;poils of Monmouth-&s;treet; he like|wi&s;e
enli&s;ted another footman and valet de cham|bre
into his &s;ervice, and &s;ent to the apartments
divers large trunks, &s;uppo&s;ed to be filled with
<PB N="229" REF="238">
the baggage of this foreign nobleman, though
in reality, they contained little el&s;e than com|mon
lumber.</P>
<P>Next day, our adventurer took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
his new habitation, after having left to his friend
and a&s;&s;ociate the ta&s;k of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the unfortu|nate
Ellenor, who was &s;o &s;hocked at the unex|pected
me&s;&s;age, that &s;he fainted away; and when
&s;he recovered the u&s;e of her &s;en&s;es, &s;o well as
to reflect upon her forlorn condition, &s;he was
&s;eized with the mo&s;t violent tran&s;ports of grief
and di&s;may, by which her brain was di&s;ordered
to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he grew furious and di&s;|tracted,
and was by the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
the Tyroleze, conveyed into the ho&s;pital of
Bethlem; where we &s;hall leave her for the pre|&s;ent,
happily bere&s;t of her rea&s;on.</P>

and admiration.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN while, Fathom and his engine
were bu&s;ied in compleating his equipage,
&s;o that in a few days, he had procured a very
gay chariot, adorned with painting, gilding and
a coat of arms according to his own fancy and
direction: the fir&s;t u&s;e he made of this vehicle,
was that of vi&s;iting the young nobleman from
whom he had received &s;uch important civilities
on the road, in con&s;equence of an invitation at
parting, by which he learned his title and the
place of his abode in London.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip was not only plea&s;ed, but proud
to &s;ee &s;uch a &s;tranger at his gate, and entertained
<PB N="230" REF="239">
him with exce&s;s of complai&s;ance and ho&s;pitality;
in&s;omuch, that by his means our hero &s;oon be|came
acquainted with the whole circle of po|lite
company, by whom he was care&s;&s;ed for his
in&s;inuating manners and agreeable conver&s;ation.
He had thought proper to tell the nobleman at
their fir&s;t interview in town, that his rea&s;ons
for concealing his knowledge of the Engli&s;h
tongue were now removed, and that he would
no longer deny him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of &s;peaking
a language which had been always mu&s;ick to his
ear: he had al&s;o thanked his lord&s;hip for his ge|nerous
interpo&s;ition at the inn, which was an
in&s;tance of that genero&s;ity and true politene&s;s,
which are engro&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h people, who
leave nought to other nations but the meer &s;ha|dow
of the&s;e virtues.</P>
<P>A te&s;timony like this, from the mouth of
&s;uch a noble &s;tranger, won the heart of the
peer, who profe&s;&s;ed a friend&s;hip for him on the
&s;pot, and undertook to &s;ee ju&s;tice done to his
lacquey, who in a &s;hort time was gratified with
a &s;hare of the &s;ei&s;ure which had been made up|on
his information, amounting to fifty or &s;ixty
pounds.</P>
<P>Ferdinand put not forth the whole &s;trength of
his accompli&s;hments at once, but contrived to
&s;pring a new mine of qualification every day, to
the &s;urprize and admiration of all his acquain|tance.
He was gifted with a &s;ort of elocution,
much more &s;pecious than &s;olid, and &s;poke on
every &s;ubject that occurred in conver&s;ation, with
that familiarity and $word$ which, one would
think, could only be acquired by long &s;tudy and
application. This plau&s;ibility and confidence,
are faculties really inherited from nature, and
<PB N="231" REF="240">
effectually &s;erve the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, in lieu of that
learning, which is not to be obtained without
infinite toil and per&s;everance: the mo&s;t &s;uperfi|cial
tincture of the arts and &s;ciences in &s;uch a
juggler, is &s;ufficient to dazzle the under&s;tanding
of half mankind; and if managed with circum|&s;pection,
will enable him even to &s;pend his
life among the literati, without once forfeiting
the character of a connoi&s;&s;eur.</P>
<P>Our hero was perfectly ma&s;ter of this leger|demain,
which he carried to &s;uch a pitch of a&s;|&s;urance,
as to declare in the mid&s;t of a mathe|matical
a&s;&s;embly, that he intended to gratify
the publick with a full confutation of Sir I&s;aac
Newton's philo&s;ophy, to the nature of which he
was as much a &s;tranger as the mo&s;t &s;avage Hot|tentot
in Afric. His preten&s;ions to profound
and univer&s;al knowledge, were &s;upported not
only by this kind of pre&s;umption, but al&s;o by
the facility with which he &s;poke &s;o many diffe|rent
languages, and the &s;hrewd remarks he had
made in the cour&s;e of his travels and ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>Among politicians, he &s;ettled the balance of
power upon a certain footing, by dint of inge|nious
&s;chemes, which he had contrived for the
welfare of Europe. With officers, he reformed
the art of war, with improvements which had
occurred to his reflection, while he was engaged
in a military life. He &s;ometimes held forth up|on
painting, like a member of the <HI>Dillettanti</HI>
club: the theory of mu&s;ick was a theme upon
which he &s;eemed to expatiate with particular
plea&s;ure: in the provinces of love and gallantry,
he was a perfect Oroondates: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t
agreeable manner of telling entertaining &s;tories,
<PB N="232" REF="241">
of which he had a large collection: he &s;ung
with great melody and ta&s;te, and played upon
the violin with &s;urprizing execution. To the&s;e
qualifications, let us add his affability and pliant
di&s;po&s;ition, and then the reader will not wonder
that he was looked upon as the pattern of human
perfection, and his acquaintance courted accord|ingly.</P>
<P>While he thus captivated the favour and af|fection
of the Engli&s;h nobility, he did not neg|lect
to take other mea&s;ures in behalf of the part|ner&s;hip
to which he had &s;ub&s;cribed. This ad|venture
with the two &s;quires at Paris, had
weakened his appetite for play, which was not
at all re&s;tored by the ob&s;ervations he had made
in London, where the art of gaming is reduced
into a regular &s;y&s;tem, and its profe&s;&s;ors &s;o lau|dably
devoted to the di&s;charge of their functions,
as to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t temperate regimen, le&s;t
their invention &s;hould be impaired by the fatigue
of watching or exerci&s;e, and their ideas di&s;turb|ed
by the &s;umes of indige&s;tion. No Indian
Brachman could live more ab&s;temious than two
of the pack, who hunted in couple, and ken|nelled
in the upper apartments of the hotel in
which our adventurer lived: they ab&s;tained from
animal food with the abhorrence of Pythagore|ans,
their drink was the pure, &s;imple element,
they were vomited once a week, took phy&s;ic or
a gly&s;ter every third day, &s;pent the forenoon in
algebraical calculations, and &s;lept from four o'clock
till midnight, that they might then take the
field with that cool fertility which is the effect
of refre&s;hment and repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e were terms upon which our hero would
not ri&s;que his fortune; he was too much addict|ed
<PB N="233" REF="242">
to plea&s;ure to forego every other enjoyment
but that of ama&s;&s;ing; and did not &s;o much de|pend
upon his dexterity in play, as upon his
talent of in&s;inuation, which by this time, had
&s;ucceeded &s;o far beyond his expectation, that
he began to indulge the hope of en&s;laving the
heart of &s;ome rich heire&s;s, who&s;e fortune would
at once rai&s;e him above all dependance. Indeed
no man ever &s;et out with a fairer pro&s;pect on
&s;uch an expedition; for, he had found means
to render him&s;elf &s;o agreeable to the fair &s;ex,
that like the boxes of the playhou&s;e, during the
repre&s;entation of a new performance, his com|pany
was often be&s;poke for a &s;eries of weeks;
and no lady, whether widow, wife or maiden,
ever mentioned his name, without &s;ome epithet
of e&s;teem or affection; &s;uch as <HI>the dear Count!
the charming Man! the Nonpareil!</HI> or <HI>the
Angel!</HI></P>
<P>While he thus &s;hone in the zenith of admira|tion,
it is not to be doubted, that he could have
melted &s;ome wealthy dowager or opulent ward:
but being an enemy to all precipitate engage|ments,
he re&s;olved to act with great care and
deliberation in an affair of &s;uch importance, e&s;|pccially
as he did not find him&s;elf hurried by
the importunities of want: for, &s;ince his arrival
in England, he had rather increa&s;ed than ex|hau&s;ted
his finances, by methods equally cer|tain
and &s;ecure. In a word, he with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of Ratchkali carried on a traffick, which
yielded great profits, without &s;ubjecting the tra|der
to the lea&s;t lo&s;s or inconvenience. Fathom,
for example, wore upon his finger a large bril|liant,
which he played to &s;uch advantage one
night, at a certain nobleman's hou&s;e, where he
<PB N="234" REF="243">
was prevailed upon to entertain the company
with a &s;olo on the violin, that every body pre|&s;ent
took notice of it's uncommon lu&s;tie, and
it was handed about for the peru&s;al of every indi|vidual.
The water and the workman&s;hip were
univer&s;ally admired; and one among the re&s;t,
having expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of knowing the value
of &s;uch a jewel, the count &s;eized that opportu|nity
of entertaining them with a learned di&s;qui|&s;ition
into the nature of &s;tones; this introduced
the hi&s;tory of the diamond in que&s;tion, which
he &s;aid had been purcha&s;ed of an Indian trader
of Fort St. George, at an under price; &s;o that
the pre&s;ent proprietor could afford to &s;ell it at
a very rea&s;onable rate; and concluded with tell|ing
the company, that for his own part, he had
been importuned to wear it, by the jeweller,
who imagined it would have a better chance for
attracting a purcha&s;er on his &s;inger, than while
it remained in his own cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>This declaration was no &s;ooner made, than
a certain lady of quality, be&s;poke the refu&s;e of
the jewel, and de&s;ired Ferdinand to &s;end the
owner next day to her hou&s;e, where he accord|ingly
waited upon her lady&s;hip with the ring,
for which he received one hundred and fifty
guineas, two thirds of the &s;um being clear gain,
and equally divided betwixt the a&s;&s;ociates. Nor
was this bargain &s;uch as reflected di&s;honour upon
the lady's ta&s;te, or could be productive of ill
con&s;equences to the merchant: for the method
of e&s;timating diamonds is altogether arbitrary;
and Ratchkali, who was an exqui&s;ite lapidary,
had &s;et it in &s;uch a manner as would have im|po&s;ed
upon any ordinary jeweller. By the&s;e
means of introduction, the Tyroleze &s;oon mono|polized
<PB N="235" REF="244">
the cu&s;tom of a great many noble fami|les,
upon which he levied large contributions,
without incurring the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of deceit:
he every day out of pure e&s;teem and gratitude
for the honour of their commands, entertained
them with the &s;ight of &s;ome new trinket, which
he was never permitted to carry home, un&s;old;
and from the profits of each job, a tax was rai&s;ed
for the benefit of our adventurer.</P>
<P>Yet his indultos were not confined to the arti|cle
of jewels, which con&s;tituted only one part
of his revenue: by the indu&s;try of his under|&s;trapper,
he procured a number of old crazy
fiddles, which were thrown a&s;ide as lumber;
upon which he counterfeited the Cremona mark,
and otherwi&s;e cook'd them up with great dex|terity;
&s;o that when he had occa&s;ion to regale
the lovers of mu&s;ick, he would &s;end for one of
the&s;e vamped in&s;truments, and extract from it
&s;uch tones as quite ravi&s;hed the hearers; among
whom there was always &s;ome conceited preten|der,
who &s;poke in raptures of the violin, and
gave our hero an opportunity of launching out
in its prai&s;e, and declaring it was the be&s;t Cre|mona
he had ever touched. This encomium
never failed to inflame the de&s;ires of the audience,
to &s;ome one of whom, he was generous enough
to part with it at prime co&s;t, that is, for twenty
or thirty guineas clear profit; for he was often
able to oblige his friends in this manner, be|cau&s;e,
being an eminent connoi&s;&s;eur, his coun|tenance
was &s;olicited by all the mu&s;icians, who
wanted to di&s;po&s;e of &s;uch moveables.</P>
<P>Nor did he neglect the other re&s;ources of a
&s;kilful virtuo&s;o. Every auction afforded &s;ome
picture, in which, though it had been over-looked
<PB N="236" REF="245">
by the ignorance of the times, he recognized
the &s;tile of a great ma&s;ter, and made a merit of
recommending it to &s;ome noble friend. This
commerce he likewi&s;e extended to medals,
bronzes, bu&s;ts, intaglios and old china, and kept
divers artificers continually employed in making
antiques for the Engli&s;h nobility. Thus he went
on with &s;uch rapidity of &s;ucce&s;s in all his endea|vours,
that he him&s;elf was a&s;toni&s;hed at the in|fatuation
he had produced. Nothing was &s;o
wretched among the productions of art, that he
could not impo&s;e upon the world as a capital
performance, and &s;o fa&s;cinated were the eyes of
his admirers, he could ea&s;ily have per&s;uaded them
that a barber's ba&s;on was an Etrurian Patera,
and the cover of a copper pot, no other than
the &s;hield of Ancus Martius. In &s;hort, it was
become &s;o fa&s;hionable to con&s;ult the count in
every thing relating to ta&s;te and politene&s;s, that
not a plan was drawn, not even an hou&s;e fur|ni&s;hed
without his advice and approbation; nay,
to &s;uch a degree did his reputation in the&s;e mat|ters
excel, that a particular pattern of paper|hangings
was known by the name of Fathom;
and his hall was every morning crouded with
uphol&s;terers and other trade&s;men, who came by
order of their employers, to learn his choice,
and take his directions.</P>
<P>The character and influence he thus acquired
he took care to maintain with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;|duity
and circum&s;pection: he never failed to ap|pear
the chief per&s;onage at all public diver&s;ions,
and private a&s;&s;emblies, not only in conver&s;ation
and dre&s;s, but al&s;o in the article of dancing, in
which he out&s;tripped all his fellows, as far as in
every other genteel accompli&s;hment.</P>

a compleat victory.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH a preheminence could not be enjoyed
without exciting the malevolence of envy
and detraction, in the propagation of which,
none were &s;o indu&s;trious as the brethren of
his own order, who, had like him, made a
de&s;cent upon this i&s;land, and could not without
repining, &s;ee the whole harve&s;t in the hands of
one man, who with equal art and di&s;cretion
avoided all intercour&s;e with their &s;ociety. In
vain they &s;trove to di&s;cover his pedigree, and
detect the particular circum&s;tances of his life
and conver&s;ation; all their inquiries were ba&s;led
by the ob&s;curity of his origin, and that &s;olitary
&s;cheme which he had adopted in the beginning
of his career. The whole fruit of their inve&s;ti|gation,
amounted to no more than a certainty
that there was no family of any con&s;ideration
in Europe, known by the denomination of Fa|thom;
and this di&s;covery they did not fail to di|vulge
for the benefit of our adventurer, who
had by this time, taken &s;uch firm root in the
favour of the great, as to &s;et all tho&s;e little arts
at defiance; and when the report reached his
ear, actually made his friends merry with the
conjectures which had been circulated at his ex|pence.</P>
<P>His adver&s;aries finding them&s;elves di&s;appointed
in this effort, held a con&s;ultation to devi&s;e other
mea&s;ures again&s;t him, and came to a re&s;olution
<PB N="238" REF="247">
of ending him by the &s;word, or rather of ex|pelling
him from the kingdom, by the fear of
death, which they hoped he had not courage
enough to re&s;i&s;t, becau&s;e his deportment had
been always remarkably mild and pacific. It was
upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, that they left to the deter|mination
of the dice, the choice of the per&s;on
who &s;hould execute their plan; and the lot fall|ing
upon a Swi&s;s, who from the &s;tation of a foot|&s;oldier
in the Dutch &s;ervice, out of which he
had been drummed for theft, had erected him|&s;elf
into the rank of a &s;elf-created chevalier;
this hero fortified him&s;elf with a double do&s;e of
brandy, and betook him&s;elf to a certain noted
coffee-hou&s;e, with an intent to affront count
Fathom in publick.</P>
<P>He was lucky enough to find our adventurer
&s;itting at a table in conver&s;ation with &s;ome per|&s;ons
of the fir&s;t rank; upon which he &s;eated him|&s;elf
in the next box, and after having intruded
him&s;elf into their di&s;cour&s;e, which happened to
turn upon the politicks of &s;ome German court;
&startq;Count,&endq; &s;aid he to Ferdinand, in a very a|brupt
and di&s;agreeable manner of addre&s;s, &startq;I
was la&s;t night in company with &s;ome gentle|men,
among whom a di&s;pute happened about the
place of your nativity; pray, what country are
you of?&endq; &startq;Sir,&endq; an&s;wered the other, with
great politene&s;s, &startq;I at pre&s;ent have the honour
to be of England.&endq; &startq;Oho!&endq; replied the che|valier,
&startq;I ask your pardon, that is to &s;ay, you
are incog.&mdash;Some people may find it convenient
to keep them&s;elves in that &s;ituation.&endq; &startq;True,&endq;
&s;aid the count &startq;but &s;ome people are too well
known to enjoy that privilege.&endq; The Swi&s;s
being a little di&s;concerted at this repartee, which
<PB N="239" REF="248">
extracted a &s;mile from the audience; after &s;ome
pau&s;e, ob&s;erved, that per&s;ons of a certain cla&s;s,
had good rea&s;on to drop the remembrance of
what they have been; but a good citizen will
not forget his country or former condition.
&startq;And a bad citizen,&endq; faith Fathom, &startq;cannot
if he would, provided he has met with his de|&s;erts;
a &s;harper may as well forget the &s;hape of
a die, or a di&s;carded &s;oldier the &s;ound of a
drum.&endq;</P>
<P>As the chevalier's character and &s;tory were
not unknown, this application rai&s;ed a univer&s;al
laugh at his expence, which provoked him to
&s;uch a degree, that &s;tarting up, he &s;wore Fa|thom
could not have mentioned any object in
nature that he him&s;elf re&s;embled &s;o much as a
drum, which was exactly typified by his empti|ne&s;s
and &s;ound, with this difference however, that
a drum was never noi&s;y till beaten, whereas the
count would never be quiet until he &s;hould have
undergone the &s;ame di&s;cipline. So &s;aying, he laid
his hand upon his &s;word with a menacing look, and
walked out as if in expectation of being followed
by our adventurer, who &s;uffered him&s;elf to be de|tained
by the company, and very calmly took
notice, that his antagoni&s;t would not be ill
plea&s;ed at their interpo&s;ition. Perhaps he would
not have comported him&s;elf with &s;uch ca&s;e and
deliberation, had not he made &s;uch remarks up|on
the di&s;po&s;ition of the chevalier, as convinced
him of his own &s;afety. He had perceived a per|plexity
and perturbation in the countenance of
the Swi&s;s, when he fir&s;t entered the coffee-room;
his blunt and precipitate way of acco&s;ting him,
&s;eemed to denote confu&s;ion and compul&s;ion; and
in the mid&s;t of his ferocity, this accurate ob|&s;erver
<PB N="240" REF="249">
di&s;cerned the trepidation of fear. By the
help of the&s;e &s;igns, his &s;agacity &s;oon compre|hended
the nature of his &s;chemes, and prepared
accordingly for a formal defiance.</P>
<P>His conjecture was verified next morning by
a vi&s;it from the chevalier, who taking it for
granted that Fathom would not face an adver|&s;ary
in the field, becau&s;e he had not followed
him from the coffee-hou&s;e, went to his lodgings
with great confidence, and demanded to &s;ee the
count upon an affair that would admit of no
delay. Maurice, according to his in&s;tructions,
told him that his ma&s;ter was gone out, but de|&s;ired
he would have the goodne&s;s to repo&s;e him|&s;elf
in a parlour, till the count's return, which
he expected every moment. Ferdinand, who had
taken po&s;t in a proper place for ob&s;ervation, &s;ee|ing
his antagoni&s;t fairly admitted, took the &s;ame
road, and appearing before him, wrapped up in
a long Spani&s;h cloak, de&s;ired to know what had
procured him the honour of &s;uch an early vi&s;it.
The Swi&s;s rai&s;ing his voice to conceal his agita|tion
explained his errand, in demanding repara|tion,
for the injury his honour had &s;u&s;tained the
preceding day, in that odious allu&s;ion to a &s;can|dalous
report which had been rai&s;ed by the ma|lice
of his enemies; and in&s;i&s;ted in a very impe|rious
&s;tile, upon his attending him forthwith to
the nur&s;ery in Hyde-park. &startq;Have a little pa|tience,
&s;aid our adventurer with great compo|&s;ure,
and I will do my&s;elf the plea&s;ure to wait
upon you in a few moments.&endq;</P>
<P>With the&s;e words, he rung the bell, and call|ing
for a ba&s;on of water, laid a&s;ide his cloak,
and di&s;played him&s;elf in his &s;hirt, with a &s;word
in his right-hand, which was all over be&s;meared
<PB N="241" REF="250">
with recent blood, as if he had ju&s;t come from
the &s;laughter of a foe. This phaenomenon made
&s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon the a&s;toni&s;hed chevalier,
already di&s;compo&s;ed by the re&s;olute behaviour of
the count, that he became jaundiced with terror
and di&s;may, and while his teeth chattered in his
head, told our hero he had hoped from his known
politene&s;s, to have found him ready to acknow|ledge
an injury which might have been the effect
of anger or mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, in which ca&s;e the af|fair
might have been compromi&s;ed to their mutual
&s;atisfaction, without proceeding to tho&s;e extremi|ties,
which, among men of honour, are always ac|counted
the la&s;t re&s;ource. To this repre&s;entation,
Ferdinand an&s;wered, that the affair had been of the
chevalier's own &s;eeking, ina&s;much as he had in|truded
him&s;elf into his company, and treated him
with the mo&s;t in&s;olent and unprovoked abu&s;e, which
plainly flowed from a premeditated de&s;ign again&s;t
his honour and reputation; he therefore, far
from being di&s;po&s;ed to own him&s;elf in the wrong,
would not even accept of a public acknowledg|ment
from him the aggre&s;&s;or, whom he look|ed
upon as an infamous &s;harper, and was re|&s;olved
to cha&s;ti&s;e accordingly.</P>
<P>Here the conver&s;ation was interrupted by the
arrival of a per&s;on who was brought to the door
in a chair, and conducted into another apart|ment,
from which a me&s;&s;age was brought to the
count, importing, that the &s;tranger de&s;ired to
&s;peak with him, upon bu&s;ine&s;s of the la&s;t im|portance.
Fathom having chid the &s;ervant for
admitting people without his order, de&s;ired the
Swi&s;s to excu&s;e him for a minute longer, and went
into the next room; from whence the follow|ing
dialogue was overheard by this challenger.
<PB N="422" REF="251">
&startq;Count,&endq; &s;aid the &s;tranger, &startq;you are not ig|norant
of my preten&s;ions to the heart of that
young lady, at who&s;e hou&s;e I met you ye&s;terday;
therefore you cannot be &s;urprized when I declare
my&s;elf di&s;plea&s;ed with your vi&s;its and behaviour
to my mi&s;tre&s;s, and demand that you will in|&s;tantly
promi&s;e to drop the corre&s;pondence.&endq;
&startq;El&s;e what follows?&endq; an&s;wered Ferdinand, with
a cool and temperate voice. &startq;My re&s;entment
and immediate defiance; replied the other, for
the only alternative I propo&s;e, is to forego your
de&s;ign upon that lady, or to decide our preten|&s;ions
by the &s;word.&endq;</P>
<P>Our hero having expre&s;&s;ed a regard for this
vi&s;itant, as the &s;on of a gentleman whom he
honoured, was at the pains to repre&s;ent the un|rea&s;onablene&s;s
of his demand, and the folly of
his pre&s;umption; and earne&s;tly exhorted him to
put the i&s;&s;ue of his cau&s;e upon a more &s;afe and
equitable footing. But this admonition, in|&s;tead
of appea&s;ing the wrath, &s;eemed to inflame
the re&s;entment of the opponent, who &s;wore he
would not leave him until he &s;hould have ac|compli&s;hed
the purport of his errand. In vain
our adventurer reque&s;ted half an hour for the
di&s;patch of &s;ome urgent bu&s;ine&s;s, in which he
was engaged with a gentleman in the other par|lour:
this impetuous rival rejected all the terms
he could propo&s;e, and even challenged him to
decide the controver&s;y upon the &s;pot; an expe|dient
to which the other having a&s;&s;ented with
reluctance, the door was &s;ecured, the &s;words
un&s;heathed, and an hot engagement en&s;ued, to
the inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure of the Swi&s;s, who did
not doubt that he him&s;elf would be &s;creened from
all danger by the event of this rencontre: ne|verthele&s;s,
his hope was di&s;appointed in the de|feat
<PB N="243" REF="252">
of the &s;tranger, who was quickly di&s;armed,
in con&s;equence of a wound through the &s;word
arm; upon which occa&s;ion Fathom was heard to
&s;ay, that in con&s;ideration of his youth and fa|mily,
he had &s;pared his life; but he would not
act with the &s;ame tenderne&s;s towards any other
antagoni&s;t. He then bound up the limb he had
di&s;abled, conducted the vanqui&s;hed party to his
chair, rejoined the chevalier with a &s;erene coun|tenance,
and asking pardon for having detained
him &s;o long, propo&s;ed they &s;hould in&s;tantly &s;et out
in an hackney coach, for the place of appointment.</P>
<P>The &s;tratagem thus conducted, had all the
&s;ucce&s;s the inventor could de&s;ire. The fear of
the Swi&s;s had ri&s;en almo&s;t to an exta&s;y, before
the count quitted the room; but after this
&s;ham battle which had been preconcerted be|twixt
our adventurer and his friend Ratchkali,
the chevalier's terrors were un&s;peakable. He
con&s;idered Fathom as a devil incarnate, and went
into the coach as a malefactor bound for Tyburn.
He would have gladly compounded for the lo&s;s of
a leg or arm, and entertained &s;ome tran&s;ient
gleams of hope, that he &s;hould e&s;cape for half
a dozen fle&s;h-wounds, which he would have
willingly received, as the price of his pre&s;umption;
but, the&s;e hopes were bani&s;h'd by the remembrance
of that dreadful declaration which he had heard
the count make, after having overcome his la&s;t ad|ver&s;ary;
and he continued under the power of the
mo&s;t in&s;upportable pannic, until the carriage halted
at Hyde-park-corner, were he crawled forth in a
mo&s;t piteous and lamentable condition; &s;o that when
they reached the &s;pot, he was &s;carce able to &s;tand.</P>
<P>Here he made an effort to &s;peak, and propo&s;|ed
an accommodation upon a new plan, by
<PB N="244" REF="253">
which he promi&s;ed to leave his cau&s;e to the ar|bitrement
of tho&s;e gentlemen who were pre&s;ent
at the rupture, and to ask pardon of the count,
provided he &s;hould be found guilty of a tre&s;pa&s;s
upon good manners: but this propo&s;al would
not &s;atisfy the implacable Ferdinand, who per|ceiving
the agony of the Swi&s;s, re&s;olved to make
the mo&s;t of the adventure, and giving him to
under&s;tand he was not a man to be tri&s;led with,
de&s;ired him to draw without further preamble.
Thus compelled, the unfortunate game&s;ter pulled
off his coat, and putting him&s;elf in a po&s;ture,
to u&s;e the words of Nym, &startq;winked and held
out his cold iron.&endq;</P>
<P>Our adventurer, far from making a gentle
u&s;e of the advantages he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, fiercely at|tacked
him, while he was incapable of making
re&s;i&s;tance, and aiming at a fle&s;hy part, ran
him through the arm and out&s;ide of the
&s;houlder at the very fir&s;t pa&s;s: the chevalier,
already &s;tupified with the horror of expectation,
no &s;ooner felt his adver&s;ary's point in his body,
than he fell to the ground, and concluding he
was no longer a man for this world, began to
cro&s;s him&s;elf with great devotion, while Fa|thom
walked home deliberately, and in his way
&s;ent a couple of chairmen to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
wounded knight.</P>
<P>This atchievement, which could not be con|cealed
from the knowledge of the publick, not
only furni&s;hed the character of Fathom with
fre&s;h wreaths of admiration and applau&s;e, but
likewi&s;e effectually &s;ecured him from any future
attempts of his enemies, to whom the Swi&s;s, for
his own &s;ake, had communicated &s;uch terrible

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He performs another exploit that conveys a true
idea of his gratitude and honour.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not long after this celebrated victory,
that he was invited to &s;pend part of the &s;um|mer,
at the hou&s;e of a country gentleman, who
lived about one hundred miles from London,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very opulent fortune, the greate&s;t
part of which was expended in acts of old
Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality. He had met with our hero
by accident, at the table of a certain great man,
and was &s;o &s;truck with his manner and conver|&s;ation,
as to de&s;ire his acquaintance and culti|vate
his friend&s;hip; and he thought him&s;elf ex|tremely
happy in having prevailed upon him to
pa&s;s a few weeks in his family.</P>
<P>Fathom, among his other ob&s;ervations, per|ceived
that there was a dome&s;tic unea&s;ine&s;s, oc|ca&s;ioned
by a very beautiful young creature, about
the age of fifteen, who re&s;ided in the hou&s;e un|der
the title of the gentleman's niece, though &s;he
was in reality, his natural daughter, born before
his marriage. This circum&s;tance was not un|known
to his lady, by who&s;e expre&s;s approba|tion
he had be&s;towed particular attention upon
the education of the child, whom we &s;hall di|&s;tingui&s;h
by the name of Celinda: their libera|lity
in this particular, had not been mi&s;applied;
for &s;he not only gave marks of uncommon
capacity, but as &s;he grew up, became more and
more amiable in her per&s;on, and was now re|turned
<PB N="246" REF="255">
from the boarding-&s;chool, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
every accompli&s;hment that could be acquired
by one of her age and opportunities. The&s;e
qualifications; which endeared her to every other
per&s;on, excited the jealou&s;y and di&s;plea&s;ure of
her &s;uppo&s;ed aunt, who could not bear to &s;ee
her own children eclip&s;ed by this illegitimate
daughter, whom &s;he therefore di&s;countenanced
upon all occa&s;ions, and expo&s;ed to &s;uch mortifi|cations
as would in all appearance drive her from
her father's hou&s;e. This per&s;ecuting &s;pirit was
very di&s;agreeable to the hu&s;band, who loved Ce|linda
with, a truly paternal affection, and pro|duced
abundance of family di&s;quiet; but being
a man of a peaceable and yielding di&s;po&s;ition,
he could not long maintain the re&s;olution he had
taken in her favour, and therefore he cea&s;ed op|po&s;ing
the malevolence of his wife.</P>
<P>In this unfortunate predicament &s;tood the
fair ba&s;tard, at the arrival of our adventurer,
who being allured by her charms, and apprized
of her &s;ituation at the &s;ame time, took the ge|nerous
re&s;olution to undermine her innocence,
that he might banquet his vicious appetite with
the &s;poils of her beauty. Perhaps &s;uch a brutal
de&s;ign might not have entered his imagination,
if he had not ob&s;erved in the di&s;po&s;ition of this
haple&s;s maiden, certain peculiarities from which
he derived the mo&s;t confident pre&s;ages of &s;ucce&s;s.
Be&s;ides a total want of experience, that left her
open and unguarded again&s;t the attacks of the
other &s;ex, &s;he di&s;covered a remarkable &s;pirit of
credulity and &s;uper&s;titious fear, which had been
cheri&s;hed by the conver&s;ation of her &s;chool-fel|lows:
&s;he was particularly fond of mu&s;ick, in
which &s;he had made &s;ome progre&s;s; but &s;o deli|cate
<PB N="247" REF="256">
was the texture of her nerves, that one
day, while Fathom entertained the company
with a favourite air, &s;he actually &s;wooned with
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Such &s;en&s;ibility our projector well knew,
mu&s;t be diffu&s;ed through all the pa&s;&s;ions of her
heart; he congratulated him&s;elf upon the &s;ure
a&s;cendancy he had gained over her in this parti|cular;
and forthwith began to execute the plan
he had erected for her de&s;truction. That he
might the more effectually deceive the vigilance
of her father's wife, he threw &s;uch a da&s;h of
affectation in his complai&s;ance towards Celinda,
as could not e&s;cape the notice of that prying ma|tron,
though it was not palpable enough to di&s;|oblige
the young lady her&s;elf, who could not &s;o
well di&s;tingui&s;h between over&s;trained courte&s;y and
real good breeding: this behaviour &s;creened him
from the &s;u&s;picion of the family, who con&s;idered
it as an effort of politene&s;s, to cover his indif|ference
and di&s;gu&s;t for the daughter of his friend,
who had by this time, given &s;ome rea&s;on to be|lieve
&s;he looked upon him with the eyes of af|fection;
&s;o that the opportunities he enjoyed of
conver&s;ing with her in private, were le&s;s liable
to intru&s;ion or inquiry. Indeed, from what I
have already ob&s;erved, touching the &s;entiments
of her &s;tep-dame, that lady, far from taking
mea&s;ures for thwarting our hero's de&s;ign, would
have rejoiced at the execution of it, and had
&s;he been informed of his intent, might have
fallen upon &s;ome method to facilitate the enter|prize;
but, as he &s;olely depended upon his own
talents, he never dreamed of &s;oliciting &s;uch an
auxiliary.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="257">
Under cover of in&s;tructing and accompli&s;hing
her in the exerci&s;e of mu&s;ick, he could not want
occa&s;ions for promoting his aim; when after
having &s;oothed her &s;en&s;e of hearing, even to a
degree of ravi&s;hment, &s;o as to extort from her
an exclamation, importing, that he was &s;urely
&s;omething &s;upernatural! he never failed to whi&s;|per
&s;ome in&s;idious compliment or tale of love,
exqui&s;itely &s;uited to the emotions of her &s;oul.
Thus was her heart in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ubdued; though
more than half his work was &s;till undone; for,
at all times, &s;he di&s;clo&s;ed &s;uch purity of &s;enti|ment,
&s;uch inviolable attachment to religion and
virtue, and &s;eemed &s;o aver&s;e to all &s;orts of in|flammatory
di&s;cour&s;e, that he dur&s;t not pre&s;ume
upon the footing he had gained in her affection,
to explain the ba&s;ene&s;s of his de&s;ire; therefore
applied to another of her pa&s;&s;ions, that proved
the bane of her virtue: this was her timidity,
which at fir&s;t being con&s;titutional, was afterwards
increa&s;ed by the circum&s;tances of her education,
and now aggravated by the artful conver&s;ation of
Fathom, which he checquered with di&s;mal &s;tories
of omens, portents, prophecies and apparitions,
delivered upon &s;uch unque&s;tionable te&s;timony,
and with &s;uch marks of conviction, as capti|vated
the belief of the devoted Celinda, and
filled her imagination with uncea&s;ing terrors.</P>
<P>In vain &s;he &s;trove to di&s;pel tho&s;e frightful
ideas, and avoid &s;uch topics of di&s;cour&s;e for the
future: the more &s;he endeavoured to bani&s;h them,
the more trouble&s;ome they became; and &s;uch
was her infatuation, that as her terrors increa&s;ed,
her thir&s;t after that &s;ort of knowledge was aug|mented.
Many &s;leeple&s;s nights did &s;he pa&s;s a|mid&s;t
tho&s;e horrors of fancy, &s;tarting at every
<PB N="249" REF="258">
noi&s;e, and &s;weating with dreary apprehen&s;ion,
yet a&s;hamed to own her fears, or &s;ollicit the
comfort of a bed-fellow, left &s;he &s;hould incur the
ridicule and cen&s;ure of her father's wife; and
what rendered this di&s;po&s;ition the more irk&s;ome,
was the &s;olitary &s;ituation of her chamber, that
&s;tood at the end of a long gallery &s;carce within
hearing of any other inhabited part of the
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances had been duly weighed
by our projector, who having prepared Celinda
for his purpo&s;e, &s;tole at midnight from his apart|ment,
which was in another &s;tory, and ap|proaching
her door, there uttered a piteous
groan; then &s;oftly retired to his bed, in full
confidence of &s;eeing next day the effect of this
operation: nor did his arrow mi&s;s the mark:
poor Celinda's countenance gave &s;uch indications
of melancholy and di&s;may, that he could not
omit a&s;king the cau&s;e of her di&s;quiet, and &s;he, at
his earne&s;t reque&s;t, was prevailed upon to com|municate
the dreadful &s;alutation of the preced|ing
night, which &s;he con&s;idered as an omen of
death to &s;ome per&s;on in the family, in all proba|bility
to her&s;elf, as the groan &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue
from one corner of her own apartment. Our
adventurer argued again&s;t this &s;uppo&s;ition, as
contradictory to the common ob&s;ervation of
tho&s;e &s;upernatural warnings, which are not u&s;u|ally
imparted to the per&s;on who is doomed to
die, but to &s;ome faithful friend or tru&s;ty &s;ervant,
particularly intere&s;ted in the event. He therefore
&s;uppo&s;ed that the groans foreboded the death of
my lady, who &s;eemed to be in a drooping &s;tate
of health, and were by her genius conveyed to
the organs of Celinda, who was the chief &s;uf|ferer
<PB N="250" REF="259">
by her jealous and barbarous di&s;po&s;ition;
he likewi&s;e expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire to be an
ear-witne&s;s of &s;uch &s;olemn communication, and
alledging that it was highly improper for a young
lady of her delicate feelings, to expo&s;e her&s;elf
alone to &s;uch another di&s;mal vi&s;itation, begged
he might be allowed to watch all night in her
chamber, in order to defend her from the &s;hock|ing
impre&s;&s;ions of fear.</P>
<P>Though no per&s;on ever &s;tood more in need of
a companion or guard, and her heart throbbed
with tran&s;ports of di&s;may at the pro&s;pect of night,
&s;he rejected his propo&s;al with due acknowledg|ment,
and re&s;olved to tru&s;t &s;olely to the protec|tion
of Heaven: not that &s;he thought her inno|cence
or reputation could &s;uffer by her compliance
with his reque&s;t; for hitherto, her heart was a
&s;tranger to tho&s;e young de&s;ires which haunt the
fancy and warm the brea&s;t of youth; &s;o that
being ignorant of her danger, &s;he &s;aw not the
nece&s;&s;ity of avoiding temptation: but &s;he refu&s;ed
to admit a man into her bed-chamber, merely
becau&s;e it was a &s;tep altogether oppo&s;ite to the
forms and decorum of life. Neverthele&s;s, far
from being di&s;couraged by this repul&s;e, he knew
her fears would multiply, and reduce that reluc|tance,
which, in order to weaken, he had recour&s;e
to another piece of machinery, that operated
powerfully in behalf of his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Some years ago, a twelve-&s;tringed in&s;trument
was contrived by a very ingenious mu&s;ician, by
whom it was aptly intitled the harp of Aeolus,
becau&s;e, being properly applied to a &s;tream of
air, it produces a wild, irregular variety of har|monious
&s;ounds, that &s;eem to be the effect of
inchantment, and wonderfully di&s;po&s;e the mind
<PB N="251" REF="260">
for the mo&s;t romantic &s;ituations. Fathom, who
was really a virtuo&s;o in mu&s;ick, had brought one
of tho&s;e new-fa&s;hioned guittarres into the coun|try,
and as the effect of it was &s;till unknown
in the family, he that night converted it to the
purpo&s;es of his amour, by fixing it in the ca&s;e|ment
of a window belonging to the gallery, ex|po&s;ed
to the we&s;t-wind, which then blew in a
gentle breeze. The &s;trings no &s;ooner felt the im|pre&s;&s;ion
of the balmy zephyr, than they began
to pour forth a &s;tream of melody, more ravi&s;h|ingly
delightful than the &s;ong of Philomel, the
warbling brook, and all the concert of the wood.
The &s;oft and tender notes of peace and love
were &s;welled up with the mo&s;t delicate and in|&s;en&s;ible
tran&s;ition, into a loud hymn of triumph
and exultation, joined by the deep-toned organ,
and a full choir of voices, which gradually de|cayed
upon the ear, until it died away, in di&s;|tant
&s;ound, as if a flight of angels had rai&s;ed the
&s;ong in their a&s;cent to Heaven. Yet the chords
hardly cea&s;ed to vibrate after the expiration of
this overture, which u&s;hered in a compo&s;ition
in the &s;ame pathetic &s;tile; and this again was
&s;ucceeded by a third, almo&s;t without pau&s;e or
intermi&s;&s;ion, as if the arti&s;t's hand had been in|defatigable,
and the theme never to be ex|hau&s;ted.</P>
<P>His heart mu&s;t be quite callous, and his ear
lo&s;t to all di&s;tinction, who could hear &s;uch har|mony
without emotion; how deeply then mu&s;t
it have affected the delicate Celinda, who&s;e &s;en|&s;ations,
naturally acute, were whetted to a mo&s;t
painful keenne&s;s, by her apprehen&s;ion; who
could have no previous idea of &s;uch entertain|ment,
and was credulous enough to believe the
<PB N="252" REF="261">
mo&s;t improbable tale of &s;uper&s;tition! She was
overwhelmed with awful terror, and never
doubting that the &s;ounds were more than mortal,
recommended her&s;elf to the care of providence
in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pious ejaculations.</P>
<P>Our adventurer having allowed &s;ome time for
the effect of this contrivance, repaired to her
chamber-door, and in a whi&s;per conveyed thro'
the key-hole, a&s;ked if &s;he was awake, begged
pardon for &s;uch an un&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it, and de|&s;ired
to know her opinion of the &s;trange mu|&s;ick
which he then heard. In &s;pite of her no|tions
of decency, &s;he was glad of his intru&s;ion,
and being in no condition to ob&s;erve punctilios,
&s;lipped on a wrapper, opened the door, and with
a faultering voice, owned her&s;elf frightened al|mo&s;t
to di&s;traction. He pretended to con&s;ole
her with reflections, importing, that &s;he was in
the hands of a benevolent being, who would
not impo&s;e upon his creatures any ta&s;k which
they could not bear; he in&s;i&s;ted upon her re|turning
to bed, and a&s;&s;ured her he would not
&s;tir from her chamber till day. Thus comforted
&s;he betook her&s;elf again to re&s;t, while he &s;at
down in an elbow-chair at &s;ome di&s;tance from
the bed-&s;ide, and in a &s;oft voice began the con|ver&s;ation
with her, on the &s;ubject of tho&s;e vi&s;i|tations
from above, which though undertaken on
pretence of di&s;&s;ipating her fear and anxiety, was
in reality calculated for the purpo&s;e of augment|ing
both.</P>
<P>&startq;That &s;weet air,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;&s;eems de&s;ign|ed
for &s;oothing the bodily angui&s;h of &s;ome &s;aint
in his la&s;t moments. Hark! how it ri&s;es into a
more &s;prightly and elevated &s;train, as if it were
an in&s;piriting invitation to the realms of bli&s;s!
<PB N="253" REF="262">
&s;ure he is now ab&s;olved from all the mi&s;ery of
this life; that full and glorious concert of voices
and cele&s;tial harps, betoken his reception among
the heavenly choir, who now wa&s;t his &s;oul to
paradi&s;ian joys! this is altogether great, &s;olemn
and amazing! the clock &s;trikes one, the &s;ympho|ny
hath cea&s;ed!&endq;</P>
<P>This was actually the ca&s;e; for, he had or|dered
Maurice to remove the in&s;trument at that
hour, le&s;t the &s;ound of it &s;hould become too fa|miliar,
and excite the curio&s;ity of &s;ome undaunt|ed
dome&s;tic, who might fru&s;trate his &s;cheme, by
di&s;covering the apparatus. As for poor Celinda,
her fancy was, by his mu&s;ick and di&s;cour&s;e, work|ed
up to the highe&s;t pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;tic terrors;
the whole bed &s;hook with her trepidation, the
awful &s;ilence that &s;ucceeded the &s;upernatural
mu&s;ick, threw an additional damp upon her
&s;pirits, and the artful Fathom affecting to &s;nore
at the &s;ame time, &s;he could no longer c$$tain
her horror, but called upon his name with a
fearful accent, and having owned her pre&s;ent
&s;ituation in&s;upportable, intreated him to draw
near her bed-&s;ide, that he might be within touch,
on any emergency.</P>
<P>This was a welcome reque&s;t to our adven|turer,
who a&s;ked pardon for his drow&s;ine&s;s, and
taking his &s;tation on the &s;ide of her bed, exhort|ed
her to compo&s;e her&s;elf; then locking her
hand fa&s;t in his own, was again &s;eized with
&s;uch an inclination to &s;leep, that he gradually
&s;unk down by her &s;ide, and &s;eemed to enjoy his
repo&s;e in that attitude. Mean while, his tender|hearted
mi&s;tre&s;s, that he might not &s;uffer in his
health, by his humanity and complai&s;ance, co|vered
him with the counterpane as he &s;lept, and
<PB N="254" REF="263">
&s;uffered him to take his re&s;t, without interrup|tion:
till he thought proper to &s;tart up &s;uddenly,
with an exclamation of, &startq;Heaven watch over
us!&endq; and then a&s;ked with &s;ymptoms of a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
if &s;he had heard nothing. Such an a|brupt
addre&s;s, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, did not
fail to amaze and affright the gentle Celinda,
who unable to &s;peak &s;prung towards her treache|rous
protector; and he catching her in his arms,
bad her &s;ear nothing; for he would, at the ex|pence
of his life, defend her from all danger.</P>
<P>Having thus, by tampering with her weakne&s;s,
conquered the fir&s;t and chief ob&s;tacles to his
de&s;ign, he with great art and per&s;everance im|proved
the intercour&s;e to &s;uch a degree of inti|macy
as could not but be productive of all the
con&s;equences which he had fore&s;een. The
groans and mu&s;ick were occa&s;ionally repeated,
&s;o as to alarm the whole family, and in&s;pire a
thou&s;and various conjectures: he failed not to
continue his nocturnal vi&s;its and gha&s;tly di&s;cour&s;e,
until his attendance became &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to this
unhappy maiden, that &s;he dur&s;t not &s;tay in her
own chamber without his company, nor even
&s;leep, except in contact with her betrayer.</P>
<P>Such a commerce between two &s;uch per&s;ons
of a different &s;ex, could not po&s;&s;ibly be long
carried on, without degenerating from the pla|tonic
&s;y&s;tem of &s;entimental love. In her paro|xy&s;ms
of di&s;may, he did not forget to breathe
the &s;oft in&s;pirations of his pa&s;&s;ion, to which &s;he
li&s;tened with more plea&s;ure, as they diverted
the gloomy ideas of her fear; and by this time
his extraordinary accompli&s;hments had made a
conque&s;t of her heart. What therefore could
be a more intere&s;ting tran&s;ition, than that from
<PB N="255" REF="264">
the mo&s;t unea&s;y to the mo&s;t agreeable &s;en&s;ation
of the human brea&s;t.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e, the reader will not won|der
that a con&s;ummate traitor, like Fathom,
&s;hould triumph over the virtue of an artle&s;s in|nocent
young creature, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions he had
entirely under his command. The gradations
towards vice are almo&s;t imperceptible, and an
experienced &s;educer can &s;trew them with &s;uch in|ticing
and agreeable flowers, as will lead the young
&s;inner on in&s;en&s;ibly, even to the mo&s;t profligate
&s;tages of guilt. All therefore that can be done
by virtue, una&s;&s;i&s;ted with experience, is to avoid
every trial with &s;uch a formidable foe, by de|clining
and di&s;couraging the fir&s;t advances to|wards
a particular corre&s;pondence with perfidious
man, how&s;oever agreeable it may &s;eem to be:
for, here, is no &s;ecurity but in con&s;cious weak|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Fathom, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;poils of poor
Celinda's honour, did not enjoy his &s;ucce&s;s with
tranquillity. Reflection and remor&s;e often in|vaded
her in the mid&s;t of their guilty plea&s;ures,
and embittered all tho&s;e moments they had dedi|cated
to mutual bli&s;s. For the &s;eeds of virtue
are &s;eldom de&s;troyed at once: even amid&s;t the
rank productions of vice, they regerminate to a
&s;ort of imperfect vegetation, like &s;ome &s;cattered
hyacinths &s;hooting up among the weeds of a
ruined garden, that te&s;tify the former culture and
amenity of the &s;oil: &s;he &s;ighed at the &s;ad remem|brance
of that virgin dignity which &s;he had lo&s;t;
&s;he wept at the pro&s;pect of that di&s;grace, morti|fication
and mi&s;ery &s;he &s;hould undergo, when
abandoned by this tran&s;ient lover, and &s;everely
<PB N="256" REF="265">
reproached him for the arts he had u&s;ed to
&s;hipwreck her innocence and peace.</P>
<P>Such expo&s;tulations are extremely un&s;ea&s;onable
when addre&s;&s;ed to a man well nigh &s;ated with
the effects of his conque&s;t; they act like &s;trong
bla&s;ts of wind applied to embers almo&s;t extin|gui&s;hed,
which in&s;tead of reviving the flame,
&s;catter and de&s;troy every remaining particle of fire,
Our adventurer, in the mid&s;t of his peculiarities,
had incon&s;tancy in common with the re&s;t of his
&s;ex. More than half cloyed with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Celinda, he could not fail to be di&s;gu&s;ted with
her upbraidings; and had &s;he not been the daugh|ter
of a gentleman who&s;e friend&s;hip he did not
think it his intere&s;t to forfeit, he would have
dropt this corre&s;pondence without reluctance or
he&s;itation: but, as he had mea&s;ures to keep with
a family of &s;uch con&s;equence, he con&s;trained
his inclinations &s;o far, as to counterfeit tho&s;e
raptures he no longer felt, and found means to
appea&s;e tho&s;e intervening tumults of her grief.</P>
<P>Fore&s;eeing, however, that it would not be al|ways
in his power to con&s;ole her on the&s;e terms;
he re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to divide her affection,
which now glowed upon him too inten&s;ely; and
with that view, whenever &s;he complained of
the vapours or dejection, he pre&s;cribed, and even
in&s;i&s;ted upon her &s;wallowing certain cordials of
the mo&s;t palatable compo&s;ition, without which
he never travelled; and the&s;e produced &s;uch
agreeable reveries and flow of &s;pirits, that &s;he
gradually became enamoured of intoxication;
while he encouraged the pernicious pa&s;&s;ion, by
expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t extravagant applau&s;e and ad|miration
at the wild, irregular &s;allies it produced.
Without having fir&s;t made this diver&s;ion, he
<PB N="257" REF="266">
would have found it impracticable to leave the
hou&s;e in tranquillity; but when this bewitching
philtre grew into an habit, her attachment to
Ferdinand was in&s;en&s;ibly di&s;&s;olved; &s;he began to
bear his neglect with indifference, and &s;eque&s;tring
her&s;elf from the re&s;t of the family, u&s;ed to &s;ol|licit
this new ally, for con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Having thus put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the
daughter's ruin, he took leave of the father with
many acknowledgments and expre&s;&s;ions of grati|tude
for his ho&s;pitality and friend&s;hip, and riding
cro&s;s the country to Bri&s;tol, took up his habi|tation
near the Hot-well, where he &s;taid during
the remaining part of the &s;ea&s;on. As for the mi|&s;erable
Celinda, &s;he became more and more ad|dicted
to the vices in which &s;he had been initiated
by his &s;uperlative perfidy and craft; until &s;he
was quite abandoned by decency and caution:
her father's heart was torn with angui&s;h, while
his wife rejoiced in her fall: at length, her
ideas were quite deba&s;ed by her infirmity; &s;he
grew every day more and more &s;en&s;ual and de|generate,
and contracted an intimacy with one
of the footmen, who was kind enough to take
her to wife, in hope of obtaining a good &s;et|tlement
from his ma&s;ter; but being di&s;appointed
in his aim, he conducted her to London, where
he made &s;hift to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into another
&s;ervice, leaving to her, the u&s;e, and partly the
advantage of her own per&s;on, which was &s;till
uncommonly attractive.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He repairs to Bri&s;tol &s;pring, where he reigns Pa|ramount
during the whole &s;ea&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall therefore, leave her in this com|fortable
&s;ituation, and return to our ad|venturer,
who&s;e appearance at Bri&s;tol was con|&s;idered
as a happy omen by the proprietor of the
hot-well, and all the people who live by the re|&s;ort
of company to that celebrated &s;pring. Nor
were they deceived in their progno&s;tic; Fathom,
as u&s;ual, formed the nucleus or kernel of the
beau monde; and the &s;ea&s;on &s;oon became &s;o
crouded, that many people of fa&s;hion were ob|liged
to quit the place for want of lodging. Fer|dinand
was the &s;oul that animated the whole
&s;ociety. He not only invented parties of plea|&s;ure,
but al&s;o, by his per&s;onal talents, rendered
them more agreeable: In a word, he regulated
their diver&s;ions, and the ma&s;ter of the ceremo|nies
never would allow the ball to be begun,
until the count was &s;eated.</P>
<P>Having thus made him&s;elf the object of ad|miration
and e&s;teem, his advice was an oracle
to which they had recour&s;e in all doubtful ca&s;es
of punctilio or di&s;pute, or even of medicine;
for among his other accompli&s;hments, his di&s;|cour&s;e
on that &s;ubject was &s;o plau&s;ible, and well
adapted to the under&s;tanding of his hearers, that
any per&s;on who had not actually &s;tudied the me|dical
art, would have believed he was in&s;pired
by the &s;pirit of Ae&s;culapius. What contributed
to the agrandizement of his character in this
branch of knowledge, was a victory he obtained
<PB N="259" REF="268">
over an old phy&s;ician, who plied at the well,
and had one day unfortunately begun to harrangue
in the pump-room, upon the nature of the Bri&s;|tol-water;
in the cour&s;e of this lecture, he un|dertook
to account for the warmth of the fluid;
and his ideas being perplexed with a great deal
of reading, which he had not been able to di|ge&s;t,
his di&s;qui&s;ition was &s;o indi&s;tinct, and his
expre&s;&s;ion &s;o ob&s;cure and unentertaining, that
our hero &s;eized the opportunity of di&s;playing his
own erudition, by venturing to contradict &s;ome
circum&s;tances of the doctor's hypothe&s;is, and
&s;ub&s;tituting a theory of his own, which, as he
had invented it for the purpo&s;e, was equally a|mu&s;ing
and chimerical.</P>
<P>He alledged, that fire was the &s;ole vivi&s;ying
principle that pervaded all nature; that as the
heat of the &s;un concocted the juice of vegetables
and ripened tho&s;e fruits that grow upon the &s;ur|face
of this globe, there was likewi&s;e an im|men&s;e
&s;tore of central fire re&s;erved within the
bowels of the earth, not only for the genera|tion
of gems, fo&s;&s;ils, and all the purpo&s;es of
the mineral world; but likewi&s;e, for cheri&s;hing
and keeping alive tho&s;e plants which would
otherwi&s;e peri&s;h by the winter's cold. The ex|i&s;tence
of &s;uch a fire, he proved from the na|ture
of all tho&s;e volcanos, which in almo&s;t every
corner of the earth, are continually vomiting
up either flames or &s;moke. &startq;The&s;e,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;are the great vents appointed by nature, for
the di&s;charge of that rarified air, and combu&s;ti|ble
matter, which if confined, would bur&s;t the
globe a&s;under; but be&s;ides the larger outlets,
there are &s;ome &s;mall chimnies through which
part of the heat tran&s;pires; a vapour of that
<PB N="260" REF="269">
&s;ort, I conceive, mu&s;t pa&s;s through the bed
or channel of this &s;pring, the waters of which,
accordingly, retain a moderate warmth.&endq;</P>
<P>This account, which totally overthrew the
other's doctrine, was &s;o extremely agreeable to
the audience, that the te&s;ty doctor lo&s;t his tem|per,
and gave them to under&s;tand without pre|amble,
that he mu&s;t be a per&s;on wholly ignorant
of natural philo&s;ophy, who could invent &s;uch a
ridiculous &s;y&s;tem, and they involved in wor&s;e
than an Aegyptian fog, that could not at once
di&s;cern its weakne&s;s and ab&s;urdity. This de|claration
introduced a di&s;pute, which was unani|mou&s;ly
determined in favour of our adventurer.
On all &s;uch occa&s;ions, the &s;tream of prejudice
runs again&s;t the phy&s;ician, even though his anta|goni&s;t
has nothing to recommend him&s;elf to the
favour of the &s;pectators: and this deci&s;ion de|pends
upon divers con&s;iderations; in the fir&s;t
place, there is a continual war carried on again&s;t
the learned profe&s;&s;ions, by all tho&s;e who, con|&s;cious
of their own ignorance, &s;eek to level the
reputation of their &s;uperiors, with their own.
Secondly, in all di&s;putes upon phy&s;ic, that hap|pen
betwixt a per&s;on who really under&s;tands the
art, and an illiterate pretender, the arguments of
the fir&s;t will &s;eem ob&s;cure and unintelligible to
tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the previous
&s;y&s;tems on which they are built; while the
other's theory, derived from common notions,
and &s;uperficial ob&s;ervation, will be more agree|able,
becau&s;e better adapted to the comprehen|&s;ion
of the hearers. Thirdly, the judgment of
the multitude is apt to be bia&s;&s;ed by that &s;urprize,
which is the effect of &s;eeing an arti&s;t foiled at
his own weapons, by one who engages him only
for amu&s;ement.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="270">
Fathom, be&s;ides the&s;e advantages, was ble&s;&s;ed
with a flow of language, an elegant addre&s;s, a
polite and &s;elf-denying &s;tile of argumentation,
together with a temper not to be ruffled; &s;o
that the victory could not long waver between
him and the phy&s;ician, to whom he was infinitely
&s;uperior in every acqui&s;ition but that of &s;olid
learning, of which the judges had no idea. This
conte&s;t was not only glorious but profitable to
our adventurer, who grew into &s;uch reque&s;t in
his medical capacity, that the poor doctor was ut|terly
de&s;erted by his patients, and Fathom's ad|vice
&s;ollicited by every valetudinarian in the
place; nor did he forfeit the character he thus
acquired, by any mi&s;carriages in his practice; be|ing
but little conver&s;ant with the Materia me|dica,
the circle of his pre&s;criptions was very
&s;mall: his chief &s;tudy was to avoid all drugs of
rough operation, and uncertain effect; and to ad|mini&s;ter
&s;uch only as &s;hould be agreeable to the
palate, without doing violence to the con&s;titution.
Such a phy&s;ician could not but be agreeable
to people of all di&s;po&s;itions; and as mo&s;t of the
patients were in &s;ome &s;hape hypochondriac, the
power of imagination co-operating with his re|medies,
often effected a cure.</P>
<P>On the whole, it became the fa&s;hion to con|&s;ult
the count in all di&s;tempers, and his reputa|tion
would have had its run, though the death
of every patient had given the lie to his preten|&s;ions.
But empty &s;ame was not the &s;ole fruit
of his &s;ucce&s;s. Though no per&s;on would pre|&s;ume
to affront this noble graduate with a fee;
they did not fail to manife&s;t their gratitude by
&s;ome more valuable pre&s;ent: every day &s;ome
&s;uperb piece of china, curious &s;nuff-box or
<PB N="262" REF="271">
jewel was pre&s;&s;ed upon him; &s;o that at the end
of the &s;ea&s;on, he could almo&s;t have furni&s;hed a
toy-&s;hop, with the acknowledgments he had re|ceived:
not only his avarice but his plea&s;ure
was gratified in the cour&s;e of his medical admi|ni&s;tration.
He enjoyed free acce&s;s, egre&s;s and
regre&s;s, with all the females at the well, and no
matron &s;crupled to put her daughter under his
care and direction. The&s;e opportunities could not
be lo&s;t upon a man of his intriguing genius;
though he conducted his amours with &s;uch di&s;|cretion,
that during the whole &s;ea&s;on, no lady's
character &s;uffered on his account: yet he was
highly fortunate in his addre&s;&s;es; and we may
venture to affirm, that the reproach of barren|ne&s;s
was more than once removed by the vigour
of his endeavours.</P>
