<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE WILLIAM Duke of DEVONSHIRE, Lord Chamberlain of his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE MINOR, who is indebted for his appear|ance on the &s;tage, to your grace's indulgence, begs leave to de&s;ire your grace's further protection, at his entering into the world.</P>
<P>Though the allegiance due from the whole dramatic people to your grace's &s;tation, might place this addre&s;s in the light of a natural tribute; yet, my lord, I &s;hould not have taken that liberty with the duke of Devon&s;hire, if I could not, at the &s;ame time, plead &s;ome little utility in the de&s;ign of my piece; and add, that the public approbation has &s;tamped a value on the execution.</P>
<P>The law, which threw the &s;tage under the ab&s;olute government of a lord chamberlain, could not fail to fill the minds of all the objects of that power, with very gloomy apprehen&s;ions; they found them&s;elves (through their own licentiou&s;ne&s;s, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd) in a more precarious dependant &s;tate, than any other of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects. But when their direction was lodged in the hands of a nobleman, who&s;e an|ce&s;tors had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;truggled for national liber|ty, they cea&s;ed to fear for their own. It was not from a patron of the liberal arts, they were to expect an oppre&s;&s;or; it was not from the friend of freedom, and of man, they were to dread partial monopolies, or the e&s;tabli&s;hment of petty tyrannies.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">Their warme&s;t wi&s;hes are accompli&s;hed; none of their rights have been invaded, except, what without the fir&s;t poetic authority, I &s;hould not venture to call a right, the Jure Nocendi.</P>
<P>Your tenderne&s;s, my lord, for all the followers of the Mu&s;es, has been in no in&s;tance more con&s;picuous, than in your late favour to me, the meane&s;t of their train; your grace has thrown open (for tho&s;e who are deny'd admittance into the palaces of Parna&s;&s;us) a cottage on its borders, where the unhappy migrants may be, if not magnificently, at lea&s;t, ho&s;pitably en|tertained.</P>
<P>I &s;hall detain your grace no longer, than ju&s;t to eccho the public voice, that, for the honour, progre&s;s, and perfection of letters, your grace may long conti|nue their candid CENSOR, who have always been their generous protector.</P>
<P>I have the honor, my lord, to be, with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, and gratitude,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your grace's mo&s;t dutiful, Mo&s;t oblig'd, And obedient &s;ervant, SAMUEL FOOTE.</SIGNED>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>How can you think I wou'd be &s;uch a dog. What the devil, then, are we to have nothing per&s;onal? Give us the actors however.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="11">

<P>How &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e, by rendering them ridiculous in their profe&s;&s;ion, you, at the &s;ame time, injure their pockets. Now, as to the other gentry, they have providentially &s;omething be&s;ides their under&s;tanding to rely on; and the only injury they can receive is, that the whole town is then diverted, with what before, was only the amu&s;ement of private parties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give us then a national portrait: a Scotch|man or an Iri&s;hman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean merely the dialect of the two countries, I can't think it either a &s;ubject of &s;atyr or humour; it is an accidental unhappi|ne&s;s, for which a man is no more accountable, than the colour of his hair. Now affecta|tion I take to be the true comic object. If, in|deed, a north Briton, &s;truck with a &s;cheme of reformation, &s;hould advance from the banks of the Tweed, to teach the Engli&s;h the true pro|nunciation of their own language, he would, I think, merit your laughter: nor would a Dub|lin mechanic, who, from heading the Liberty boys in a &s;kirmi&s;h on Ormond Quay, &s;hould think he had a right to pre&s;cribe military laws
<PB N="7" REF="12">
to the fir&s;t commander in Europe, be a le&s;s ridiculous object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there &s;uch?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean that the blunders of a few pea|&s;ants, or the partial principles of a &s;ingle &s;coun|drel, are to &s;tand as characteri&s;tical marks of a whole country; your pride may produce a laugh, but, believe me, it is at the expence of your under&s;tanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday, what a &s;y&s;tem is here! Laws for laughing! And pray, &s;age Sir, in&s;truct us when we may laugh with propriety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>At an old beau, a &s;uperannuated beauty, a military coward, a &s;tuttering orator, or a gouty dancer. In &s;hort, whoever affects to be what he is not, or &s;trives to be what he cannot, is an object worthy the poet's pen, and your mirth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>P&s;ha, I don't know what you mean by your is nots, and cannots &mdash; damn'd ab&s;tru&s;e jar|gon. Ha, Canker.</P>

<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o, with the&s;e principles, you expect to thrive on this &s;pot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, it won't do. I tell thee the plain roa&s;t and boil'd of the theatres will never do at this table. We mu&s;t have high &s;ea&s;on'd rago&ucirc;ts, and rich &s;auces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, perhaps, by way of de&s;ert, I may produce &s;omething that may hit your palate.</P>

<P>Your bill of fare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What think you of one of tho&s;e itinerant field orators, who tho' at declar'd enmity with common &s;en&s;e, have the addre&s;s to poi&s;on the principles, and, at the &s;ame time, pick the pockets, of half our indu&s;trious fellow &s;ub|jects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care. Dangerous ground. Ludere cum &s;acris, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I look upon it in a different manner. I con&s;ider the&s;e gentlemen in the light of public performers, like my&s;elf; and whether we ex|hibit at Tottenham-court, or the Hay-market, our purpo&s;e is the &s;ame, and the place is im|material.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, indeed if it be con&s;idered&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="14">
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, more, I mu&s;t beg leave to a&s;&s;ert, that ridicule is the only antidote again&s;t this perni|cious poi&s;on. This is a madne&s;s that argument can never cure: and, &s;hould a little whol&s;ome &s;everity be apply'd, per&s;ecution would be the immediate cry: where then can we have re|cour&s;e, but to the comic mu&s;e; perhaps, the archne&s;s and &s;everity of her &s;mile, may redre&s;s an evil, that the Laws cannot reach, or rea&s;on reclaim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if it does not cure tho&s;e already di|&s;temper'd, it may be a means to &s;top the in|fection.</P>

<P>But how is your &s;cheme conducted?</P>

In a word, &s;ir, for two whole years, under this profe&s;&s;or, I &s;tudy'd and &s;tarv'd, impoveri&s;h'd my body, and pam|per'd my mind, till thinking my&s;elf pretty near equal to my ma&s;ter, I made him one of his own bows, and &s;et up for my&s;elf.</P>

<P>Ab&s;olute madne&s;s. But I had gone too far to recede. Then the point was, to prepare for the aweful occa&s;ion. The fir&s;t want that oc|curr'd to me, was a wig; but this was too ma|terial an article, to depend on my own judge|ment. I re&s;olv'd to con&s;ult my friends. I told them the affair &mdash; you hear, gentlemen, what has happen'd; Mr. Prig, one of the greate&s;t men, in his way, the world ever &s;aw, or ever will, quite a jewel of a man, taken with a violent fit of the cholic; to-morrow, the greate&s;t &s;hew this &s;ea&s;on; prints, pictures, bronzes, butterflies, medals, and minionettes; every body in the world to be there; lady Dy To&s;s, Mrs. Nankyn, dutche&s;s of Dupe, and all mankind; it being impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould mount, I have con&s;ented to &s;ell&mdash;They &s;tar'd&mdash; It is true, gentlemen. Now I &s;hould be glad
<PB N="71" REF="76">
to have your opinions as to a wig. They were divided: &s;ome recommended a tye, others a bag; one mentioned a bob, but was &s;oon over|rul'd. Now, for my part, I own, I rather inclin'd to the bag; but, to avoid the imputa|tion of ra&s;hne&s;s, I re&s;olv'd to take Mrs. Smirk's judgment, my wife, a dear good woman, fine in figure, high in ta&s;te, a &s;uperior genius, and knows old china like a Nabob.</P>

You know the importance of a wig; I have a&s;k'd my friends &mdash; &s;ome recommend a tye, others a bag &mdash; what is your opinion? Why, to deal freely, Mr. Smirk, &s;ays &s;he, a tye for your round, regular, &s;miling face would be rather too formal, and a bag too boyi&s;h, deficient in dignity for the &s;olemn occa&s;ion; were I worthy to advi&s;e, you &s;hould wear a &s;omething between both.

<P>Finally. But next day, when I came to mount the ro&s;trum, then was the trial. My limbs &s;hook, and my tongue trembled. The fir&s;t lot was a chamber-uten&s;il, in Chel&s;ea chi|na, of the pea-green pattern. It occa&s;ioned a great laugh; but I got thro' it. Her Grace, indeed, gave me great encouragement. I over|heard her whi&s;per to lady Dy, Upon my word, Mr. Smirk does it very well. Very well, in|deed, Mr. Smirk, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to me. I made an acknowledging bow to her Grace, as in duty bound. But one flower flounc'd invo|luntarily from me, that day, as I may &s;ay. I remember, Dr. Trifle call'd it enthu&s;ia&s;tic, and pronounc'd it a pre&s;age of my future great|ne&s;s.</P>

<P>Alas, how few are friends to the unfor|tunate! Be&s;ides, I knew, &s;ir, &s;uch a &s;tep wou'd be con&s;ider'd by my father, as an appeal from his ju&s;tice.

<P>Accident plac'd me in a hou&s;e, the mi&s;tre&s;s of which profe&s;s'd the same principles with my infamous conductre&s;s.

But this morning I was acquainted with my de&s;tiny; and no other election left me, but immediate compliance, or a jail. In this de&s;perate con|dition, you cannot wonder, &s;ir, at my choo&s;ing rather to rely on the genero&s;ity of a gentleman, than the humanity of a creature, in&s;en&s;ible to pity, and void of every virtue.</P>
