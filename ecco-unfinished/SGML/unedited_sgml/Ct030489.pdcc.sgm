<HEAD>A CHARGE TO THE GRAND JURY OF THE COUNTY of <HI>MIDDLESEX</HI>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are cho&s;en out of the body of this county, and called upon to the di&s;charge of a duty, which, as it is of great importance to the lives, the liberties, and properties of your fellow-&s;ubjects, is highly worthy of your mo&s;t &s;erious at|tention.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="5">The law of this country, founded as it is in wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, improved by the accumu|lated experience of many ages, and favourable to the liberties of the &s;ubject in a degree that admits of no compari&s;on with the laws of other countries, has given to you a primary and original juri&s;diction in criminal matters; and, except in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, where the complaint is made to a &s;uperior court of criminal judicature, has po&s;tponed all enquiry touching the delinquency of &s;uch as offend again&s;t it, to the pre&s;entment of a Grand Jury.</P>
<P>And in this in&s;titution we may di&s;cern the equity and moderation with which the law of this country di&s;tingui&s;hes between civil and cri|minal cau&s;es. In the former, which draw into que&s;tion the title to a man's e&s;tate, or &s;ubject him to a demand of reparation in damages for meer per&s;onal injuries, the delinquent is imme|diately called upon to an&s;wer the charge of his adver&s;ary; and this, though the &s;ubject matter of it be ever &s;o groundle&s;s, frivolous, or vexa|tious. But in criminal matters the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e; for over and above the advantages which the law re&s;erves to the per&s;on accu&s;ed upon a trial by his peers, his neighbours, and
<PB N="11" REF="6">
po&s;&s;ibly his friends, it has exempted him from the nece&s;&s;ity of vindicating his own innocence, until you, by your pre&s;entment, &s;hall have pro|nounced, not only that the offence wherewith he is charged is cognizable by law, (that is to &s;ay, either again&s;t the public peace, or pro|hibited by &s;ome &s;tatute,) but that the &s;ame is &s;ub&s;tantially true. In this pre&s;entment of yours a majority mu&s;t concur, and the law has far|ther provided, that that majority &s;hall at lea&s;t be twelve; &s;o that before the per&s;on accu&s;ed can be convicted, two juries mu&s;t pa&s;s upon him, making together twenty-four per&s;ons; one to a&s;certain the relevancy, and the other to deter|mine the merits of the charge.</P>
<P>Such, in a general view of it, is the authority with which you are inve&s;ted; to the faithful execution whereof, it is hoped, you will need no other incentives than your regard for the public, and that re&s;pect which all rea&s;onable men are di&s;po&s;ed to pay to the laws of their country, and the government that protects them.</P>
<P>In the di&s;charge of this your duty, rea&s;on and ju&s;tice require you to lay a&s;ide all party
<PB N="12" REF="7">
di&s;tinctions, local attachments and prejudices; and, in &s;hort, whatever el&s;e might tend to fix a bias on your judgments; and this not &s;o much becau&s;e you are by your oath re&s;trained from pre&s;enting any thing <HI>for malice or evil will</HI>; and obliged <HI>not to leave any thing not pre|&s;ented for love, favour, affection, reward, or any hopes thereof</HI>, but becau&s;e it would be wrong, repugnant to the fir&s;t principles of natural ju|&s;tice, nay, offen&s;ive to the Divine Being it&s;elf, to do otherwi&s;e. And here it may be nece&s;&s;ary to mention, as well for the information of your|&s;elves as others, that there is an antecedent ob|ligation on all men, independent of oaths and promi&s;es, to act agreeable to the dictates of truth and ju&s;tice; and that tho' your oath may <HI>&s;uper-add to</HI>, it does not <HI>create</HI>, the obligation you are under to acquit or condemn according to the evidence, which from time, &s;hall be pro|duced to you.</P>
<P>The offences properly cognizable by you, are either capital, which are puni&s;hable by lo&s;s of life and forfeiture of goods; or finable, which &s;ubject the offender to impri&s;onment, and a di&s;|cretionary fine, proportionable to the nature and degree of his offence.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="8">Under the fir&s;t head of this divi&s;ion are comprehended the crime of trea&s;on; which is of two kinds, that is to &s;ay, high-trea&s;on and petit-trea&s;on; and felonies, which are divers, &s;ome at the common law, and others by &s;tatute. And &s;o exten&s;ive is your authority, that every &s;pecies of offence, from high-trea&s;on down to tre&s;pa&s;s, which is the &s;malle&s;t infrac|tion of the public peace puni&s;hable by our laws in a criminal way, are equally within your juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity in which his maje&s;ty holds his crown, the mildne&s;s of his government, and his own regal and private virtues, have removed to a great di&s;tance the probability that that &s;pecies of high trea&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ts in the compa&s;&s;ing or imagining the death of the king, the queen, or the prince, their elde&s;t &s;on and heir, or the levying war again&s;t the king, will ever come in judgment before you. However, an offence le&s;s atrocious, it is true, but very mi&s;chievous in its con&s;equences, namely, that of libelling his mini&s;ters, and arraigning his councils, may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ubjected to your enquiry; in the cour&s;e whereof you will do well to con&s;ider, that for all mi&s;behaviour of per&s;ons in office,
<PB N="14" REF="9">
as well the king's mini&s;ters, as others, the con|&s;titution has provided a &s;ufficient remedy, by making them re&s;pon&s;ible at a proper tribunal; and that the publication of written and printed &s;lander has no better a tendency, than to le&s;&s;en that confidence in the wi&s;dom and integrity of tho&s;e, who have the direction of the public councils, which it is as much their intere&s;t to merit as to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>This, in the eyes of &s;ome per&s;ons, may &s;eem a &s;mall evil; and to ju&s;tify the practice of li|belling, it may po&s;&s;ibly be urged, that every &s;ub|ject in this kingdom has a right to cen&s;ure the conduct of tho&s;e employed in the admini&s;tra|tion of government. But admitting &s;uch a right, does it include in it the idea of power and ability &s;ufficient for the exerci&s;e of it? Before a man pre&s;umes to form a judgment on the act of another, in all rea&s;on let him thoroughly under&s;tand the motives to, and the ends of it: this is what is required in the common occur|rences of life; and how le&s;s than a competent knowledge of the &s;ubject can be &s;ufficient to qualify a man to judge of the operations of go|vernment, or the characters or abilities of tho&s;e employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of it, it is hard to
<PB N="15" REF="10">
conceive. If this be the ca&s;e, and a certain degree of &s;kill in the con&s;titution of this coun|try, its laws, its hi&s;tory, its connexions, and its intere&s;ts, be nece&s;&s;ary, as mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly it is, to enable a man to form an adequate judgment of the conduct of tho&s;e, who, from time to time, have the direction of its councils, the exerci&s;e of this liberty, which is &s;o loudly contended for, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be confined to a very few.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing a per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the knowledge requi&s;ite for the above purpo&s;e; &s;uppo&s;ing him to be what almo&s;t every man now affects to be thought, a con&s;ummate politi|cian, is &s;uch a one under no re&s;traint in this re&s;pect; &s;hall he excite jealou&s;ies in the minds of his fellow &s;ubjects, &s;hall he traduce and villify, not only blamele&s;s, but re&s;pectable cha|racters; &s;hall he blow the trumpet of faction, and &s;ound an alarm to rebellion with impu|nity? Let the law an&s;wer this que&s;tion, and declare, as it does by the mouths of its oracles, that libelling is a great offence, as it tends to the breach of the peace <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">12 Co. 35 Edwards v. Wo&ocirc;tton.</NOTE>; that every libel made again&s;t a private per&s;on merits a &s;evere puni&s;h|ment, becau&s;e it provokes all the family of
<PB N="16" REF="11">
that per&s;on to revenge; that if it be again&s;t a magi&s;trate, it concerns not only the peace, but it &s;candalizes the government; that a libeller is puni&s;hable by indictment at common law, and that according to the greatne&s;s of the offence, either by fine and impri&s;onment, or by the pil|lory <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">5 Co. 125. The ca&s;e de libellis famo&s;is.</NOTE>; that not only the writer, but the pub|li&s;her of a libel, is liable to this puni&s;hment <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">9 Co. 59. b. Lamb's ca&s;e. Moor 813. S. C.</NOTE>; and that in a pro&s;ecution for a libel, the law con&s;iders, not whether the per&s;on libelled be of good fame or not, nor whether the &s;ubject matter of the libel be true or fal&s;e, but will puni&s;h the libeller even though it be true <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">5 Co. 125.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments are adduced to &s;hew, as well the iniquity as the unrea&s;onablene&s;s and danger of the practice of libelling. Attend to others of a more &s;erious nature.</P>
<P>We have lived to &s;ee the time when all the unea&s;ine&s;&s;es ari&s;ing from a di&s;puted title to the crown of this realm, and all apprehen&s;ions of a change in the national religion, are happily &s;ub&s;ided. Our enemies abroad are reduced in their numbers, and in their power to hurt us.
<PB N="17" REF="12">
Nothing can afford them &s;o &s;trong a temptation to di&s;turb the tranquility we at this time enjoy, as the prevalence of faction among us; and nothing has &s;o great a tendency to promote faction, as the uncontrouled licence of the pre&s;s, and the liberty of uttering &s;edition and defa|mation with impunity.</P>
<P>The crime of Trea&s;on, the fir&s;t gene|ral head in the above divi&s;ion of offences, is branched out into many particulars, other than tho&s;e already mentioned; as namely, &s;o adhere to the enemies of the King, to counterfeit his great&punc; or privy &s;eal, or the cur|rent coin of the realm: the&s;e, and &s;ome other offences, are high trea&s;on. There is yet an|other &s;pecies of trea&s;on, which the law calls petit-trea&s;on; and this is defined to be homi|cide committed on a &s;ubject, between whom and the offender the law &s;uppo&s;es a &s;pecial obe|dience and &s;ubjection; as from the wife to her hu&s;band, from a &s;ervant to his ma&s;ter, or from a clerk to his bi&s;hop or dioce&s;an. The&s;e, in a general view of them, make up the whole of the offences included in the general appellation of Trea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="13">Felonies, which are the &s;econd &s;pecies of capital offences, are murder, robbery, burglary, larceny, and other crimes, &s;ufficiently under|&s;tood, either as being &s;o declared by the com|mon law, or enabled by &s;tatute.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cla&s;s of offences comprehends tho&s;e that &s;ubject the offender to fine and im|pri&s;onment; and the&s;e are either again&s;t public ju&s;tice, or the King's peace, or the profit or health of his &s;ubjects; among which are per|jury, bribery, extortion, maintenance, riots, routs, and unlawful a&s;&s;emblies and combina|tions; a&s;&s;aults, and other injuries to the per&s;ons of individuals; fore&s;talling, regrating, and in|gro&s;&s;ing; frauds and deceits of trade&s;men, ar|tificers, and &s;uch as prepare or &s;ell unwhole|&s;ome food. Under this general head are al&s;o included nu&s;ances, which con&s;i&s;t in acts either injurious to the ea&s;e, the health, or the morals of the people: &s;uch are annoyances and ob&s;tructions in the public &s;treets and high|ways, the exerci&s;e of noxious trades and bu|&s;ine&s;&s;es in particular places, and the keeping of hou&s;es for the purpo&s;es of lewdne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="14">In this cur&s;ory enumeration of offences cog|nizable by you, you cannot but di&s;cern &s;ome, which, at this time, demand your particular attention. You who&s;e habitations are mo&s;tly in the ea&s;tern part of this county, need not be told, that it is the &s;eat of a manufacture, which has long afforded the means of a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to thou&s;ands. In con&s;equence of the encouragement it has met with, tho&s;e habits of indu&s;try and par&s;imony, which at|tended its introduction into this kingdom, have given way to a &s;pirit of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which has manife&s;ted it&s;elf in outrages of the mo&s;t daring kind; combinations have been formed, contributions exacted, hou&s;es have been en|tered and plundered; manufactures, and the engines employed in carrying them on, de|&s;troyed; fire and de&s;truction have been threat|ened to individuals; and this under pretence of promoting the intere&s;ts of the inferior ma|nufacturers, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e their illegal attempts would be their ruin.</P>
<P>The general flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the ma|nufacture now &s;poken of, the rate of wages paid to the workmen employed therein, di&s;|proportionably
<PB N="20" REF="15">
greater than mo&s;t other artifi|cers require; and, above all, the indulgence which the legi&s;lature has, from time to time, &s;hewn to this exotic manufacture, by re|&s;training, not to &s;ay prohibiting, the wear of foreign commodities, have left the&s;e men with|out any rea&s;onable cau&s;e of complaint. And in this &s;tate of things you will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of puni&s;hing the promoters of illegal combi|nations, and &s;uch as take a part in riots and unlawful a&s;&s;emblies; the <HI>ultimum &s;upplicium</HI>, the utmo&s;t puni&s;hment, has been inflicted, the judg|ment of the law has been executed on &s;uch of the capital offenders in this way, as the hand of ju&s;tice could reach; this court has exerted its authority in the puni&s;hment of &s;ome who have been &s;ound guilty in a le&s;s degree; and it now remains to &s;ee, whether the &s;acrifices which have been made to public ju&s;tice, will re&s;tore to &s;uch of this body of manufacturers, as are di&s;po&s;ed to be peaceable, the liberty of maintaining them|&s;elves and their families by their own hone&s;t labour and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Injuries to the per&s;ons of the King's &s;ubjects, by a&s;&s;aults or battery, are the lowe&s;t offences &s;ubject to your enquiry. The&s;e partake in a
<PB N="21" REF="16">
great mea&s;ure of the nature of civil actions, ina&s;much as the fine upon conviction, though nominally given to the King, is in mo&s;t in&s;tances impo&s;ed with a view to a pecuniary &s;atisfaction to the injured party; and though in many ca&s;es the injury complained of, may be &s;o &s;mall as hardly to entitle the &s;ufferer to a recompence, yet where the fact is proved to your &s;atisfaction, it will be &s;afer for you in re&s;pect of your oath, and more for the public benefit, by finding the bill, to &s;ub|ject the matter to a farther enquiry, than to di&s;|charge the injured party without his remedy. The rea&s;on of this is, that in the ca&s;e of a&s;&s;aults the hope of redre&s;s from the law &s;u&s;pends the emotions of revenge. In other countries, a blow is frequently returned with a &s;tab; and in this, were it not for the wi&s;e provi&s;ion of the law, and that generous &s;pirit di&s;cernable even among the lowe&s;t of our people, indictments for a&s;&s;aults would be le&s;s frequent than for mayhem or murder.</P>
<P>Of nu&s;ances none will appear to be more wor|thy of your notice, than tho&s;e that have a ten|dency to corrupt the manners of youth. Such ar$ gaming hou&s;es, and places of lewd re&s;ort. In the&s;e the habits of idlene&s;s and debauchery are fir&s;t contracted, connections of the wor&s;t kind are
<PB N="22" REF="17">
formed, and all the ends of a virtuous education fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>Over and above the power to puni&s;h the of|fences already enumerated, the law and the con|&s;titution of this country have in a great mea&s;ure intru&s;ted to you the care of Religion; the impor|tance of which you will ea&s;ily conceive, when you are told, that civil &s;anctions have long been found too weak to re&s;train men from violence, and that without the belief of a God, of Provi|dence, and a future &s;tate, &s;ociety could no way &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>It is for the&s;e rea&s;ons that public &s;eminaries are in&s;tituted, and a peculiar order of men ex|empted from the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecular pur&s;uits, the better to qualify them for the employment of public in&s;tructors; all which care would be to little purpo&s;e, w$re religion left expo&s;ed to that in&s;ult and contumely, with which &s;ome have taken the liberty to treat it; and it is for this rea&s;on that the legi&s;lature, after declaring chri&s;tianity to be part of the law of the land, has inve&s;ted you with a power to controul and check that licentious and daring &s;pirit, which leads men to deny its authority, or controvert its
<PB N="23" REF="18">
precepts, and by con&s;equence to weaken, if not di&s;&s;olve, the bonds of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In all the provi&s;ions which the law has made for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a national religion, and the guarding it from in&s;ult, &s;uch a latitude is al|lowed for private judgment, and &s;uch is the in|dulgence given to &s;crupulous minds, that no man is left to complain that the rights of con|&s;cience are in any degree violated, excepting tho&s;e, who profe&s;s a religion &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution of this country, and which, for that rea&s;on, has not the lea&s;t claim to a toleration.</P>
<P>Taking then the religion of this country to be &s;uch as the law has made it, it is the duty of the civil magi&s;trate to promote its intere&s;ts, and it is yours al&s;o, under the authoriry of particular &s;ta|tutes, to put into a cour&s;e of puni&s;hment all &s;uch, as by writing, printing, teaching, or advi&s;ed &s;peak|ing, deny the exi&s;tence of God, or a&s;&s;ert that there are more than one, or that deny the truth of the chri&s;tian religion, or the authority of the &s;crip|tures, or that &s;hall revile the &s;acraments, or &s;peak in derogation of the book of common-prayer<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">9. and 10. W. III. cap. 32. 1. Edw. VI. cap. 4. 1. Eliz. cap. z. &sect;. 9.</NOTE>, farther, and for rea&s;ons of a political nature, and
<PB N="24" REF="19">
which enter not into the truth of its doctrines. The law has made it highly penal to exerci&s;e the Romi&s;h religion in this country, and has &s;ub|jected tho&s;e to &s;evere puni&s;hments who &s;hall en|deavour to &s;pread the infection of popery, and thereby alienate the minds and affections of the people from their rightful &s;overeign.</P>
<P>The frequency of &s;e&s;&s;ions in this county, and the means of information which, as being re&s;i|dent therein, you &s;everally have in your power, touching the nature and extent of your authority, make it unnece&s;&s;ary to be more particular in the enumeration of the &s;everal matters cognizable by you as a Grand Jury. But as the nature of your office, and indeed the terms of your oath, require that your pre&s;entments be agreeable to truth, which can only be di&s;cerned by means of the evidence produced before you, it may not be ami&s;s to give you &s;ome information touching the nature and kind of evidence which the law re|quires as the ground and foundation of your judgments. And this is the more nece&s;&s;ary, as an opinion has of late been propagated with a degree of confidence that would di&s;grace even truth it&s;elf, namely, that the <HI>&s;ame degree of evi|dence is nece&s;&s;ary to warrant a Grand Jury to find
<PB N="25" REF="20">
a bill of indictment, as would ju&s;tify a petit Jury to find a verdict again&s;t the pri&s;oner</HI>.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, that you may under&s;tand the nature of an indictment, you are to know, that it is an enquiry, finding &s;ome offence again&s;t the king; that it is the king's action, whereupon the party &s;hall be arraigned and put to an&s;wer, and tried, by another jury, and that every &s;trong &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch an offence, though it be felony, appear|ing on record, hath the force of an indictment.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Babington</HI>'s Advice to Grand Jurors in Ca&s;es of Blood, 82. <HI>Finch</HI> of Law, 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>And next it is to be ob&s;erved, that an indict|ment <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">An indictment is no part of the trial, but an informa|tion, or declaration, for the king; and the evidence of wit|ne&s;&s;es to a Grand Jury is no part of the trial, for by law the trial in that is, not by witne&s;&s;es, but by verdict of twelve men, and a manifect diver&s;ity between the evidence to the Jury, and a trial by a Jury. If the indictment were part of the trial, then ought he that is a nobleman, and lord of parliament, to be indicted by his peers; but the in|dictment again&s;t a peer of the realm is always found by freeholders, and not by peers. 3.

<P>The arguments that have been adduced in favour of the contrary notion, either prove no|thing, or they prove too much. Of the fir&s;t &s;ort

<P>It is doing too much honour to arguments of this kind to enter into a formal refutation of them. It might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn, that the admitting a Grand Jury to find an indict|ment upon <HI>probable</HI> evidence, is in favour of the &s;ubject. Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale</HI> puts a ca&s;e <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">If A. be killed by B. &s;o that it doth <HI>con&s;tare de per&s;ona occi&s;i et occidentis</HI>, and a bill of murder be pre&s;ented to them, regularly they ought to find the bill for murder, and not for man&s;laughter, or <HI>&s;e defendendo</HI>, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e offences may be &s;mothered without due trial; and when the party comes upon his trial, the whole fact will be examined before the court, and the petit Jury; and in many ca&s;es it is a great di&s;|advantage to the party accu&s;ed; for if a man kill B. in his own defence, or <HI>per infortunium</HI>, or po&s;&s;ibly in executing the proce&s;s in law upon an a&s;&s;ault made upon him, or in his own defence upon the highway, or in defence of his hou&s;e again&s;t tho&s;e who come to rob him, in which three la&s;t ca&s;es it is neither felony nor forfeiture, but, upon not guilty pleaded, he ought to be acquitted; yet if the grand Inque&s;t find <HI>Ignoramus</HI> upon the bill, or find the &s;pecial matter whereby the pri&s;oner is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and di&s;charged, he may, neverthele&s;s, be indicted for murder &s;even years after. 2. <HI>Hale</HI>'s Hi&s;t, Placit. Coron. 158.</NOTE>, which proves it beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of que&s;tion. And, waving the arguments dedu|cible

from the con&s;tant and uniform practice of Grand Juries under the direction of the wi&s;e&s;t and able&s;t judges that have ever pre&s;i|ded in our courts of ju&s;tice, let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that in favour of the contrary opinion, we have no judicial determination, nor in &s;hort any thing de&s;erving the name of authority what&s;oever.</P>
<P>To this caution, re&s;pecting the nature of the evidence, which the law requires as the ground of your pre&s;entments, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to add another touching your conduct in the cour&s;e of your proceedings during your at|tendance on this court.</P>
<P>You will recollect, that by the oath you have ju&s;t taken, you have &s;everally engaged <HI>the king's coun&s;el, that of your fellows, and your own, well and truly to keep &s;ecret</HI>. The meaning of which words is, that you

are not to reveal the evidence of any of the witne&s;&s;es that &s;hall be produced to you, nor di&s;cover what you among your&s;elves &s;hall have coun&s;elled, advi&s;ed, or debated, in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s before you; &s;uch di&s;coveries have been productive of great mi&s;chief, and may &s;ubject you to a &s;evere puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>It was once a doubt with a very reverend and learned judge, whether the revealing the king's council, di&s;clo&s;ed to the Grand Ju|rors, was not <HI>trea&s;on</HI>; <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Lib.

<P>The&s;e are the heads of your duty, in the di&s;charge whereof you will do well to con|&s;ider the obligations you are under, ari&s;ing from the terms of your oath, the nature and ends of public ju&s;tice, and the relation in which you at pre&s;ent &s;tand to that community of which you are a part.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="25">The latter of the&s;e con&s;iderations will make you &s;en&s;ible of the error of tho&s;e, who imagine, that freedom may exi&s;t in oppo&s;ition to the laws.
