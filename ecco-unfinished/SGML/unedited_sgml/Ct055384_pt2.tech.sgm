<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which our Knight is tantalized with

<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of our adventurer,
which we have particularized
in the la&s;t chapter, could not fail of
inhancing his character, not only
among tho&s;e who knew him, but
al&s;o among the people of the town to
whom he was an utter &s;tranger. The
populace &s;urrounded the hou&s;e, and
te&s;tified their approbation in loud
<PB N="2" REF="5">
huzzas. Captain Crowe was more
than ever in&s;pired with veneration for
his admired patron, and more than
ever determined to pur&s;ue his foot|&s;teps
in the road of chivalry. Fillet,
and his friend the lawyer, could not
help conceiving an affection, and
even a profound e&s;teem, for the ex|alted
virtue, the per&s;on, and the ac|compli&s;hments
of the knight, da&s;hed
as they were with a mixture of extra|vagance
and in&s;anity. Even Sir
Launcelot him&s;elf was elevated to an
extraordinary degree of &s;elf-compla|cency
on the fortunate i&s;&s;ue of his ad|venture,
and became more and more
per&s;uaded that a knight-errant's pro|fe&s;&s;ion
might be exerci&s;ed, even in
England, to the advantage of the
community. The only per&s;on of the
company who &s;eemed unanimated
with the general &s;atisfaction was Mr.
Thomas Clarke. He had, not with|out
good re$&s;on, laid it down as a
maxim, that knight-errantry and
madne&s;s were &s;yn$nimous terms;
and that madne&s;s, though exhibited
<PB N="3" REF="6">
in the mo&s;t advantageous and agree|able
light, could not change its na|ture,
but mu&s;t continue a perver&s;ion
of &s;en&s;e to the end of the chapter.
He perceived the additional impre&s;|&s;ion
which the brain of his uncle had
&s;u&s;tained, from the happy manner in
which the benevolence of Sir Launce|lot
had &s;o lately operated; and be|gan
to fear it would be, in a little
time, quite nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e
to a commi&s;&s;ion of lunacy, which
might not only di&s;grace the family of
the Crowes, but al&s;o tend to invalidate
the &s;ettlement which the captain had
already made in favour of our young
lawyer.</P>
<P>Perplexed with the&s;e cogitations,
Mr. Clarke appealed to our adven|turer's
own reflection. He expatiated
upon the bad con&s;equences that would
attend his uncle's per&s;everance in the
execution of a &s;cheme &s;o foreign to
his faculties; and intreated him, for
the love of God, to divert him from
his purpo&s;e, either by arguments or
authority; as, of all mankind, the
<PB N="4" REF="7">
knight alone had gained &s;uch an a&s;cen|dency
over his &s;pirit, that he would
li&s;ten to his exhortations with re&s;pect
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Our adventurer was
not &s;o mad, but that he &s;aw and
owned the rationality of the&s;e remarks.
He readily undertook to employ all
his influence with Crowe to di&s;&s;uade
him from his extravagant de&s;ign; and
&s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity of being
alone with the captain, to &s;ignify his
&s;entiments on this &s;ubject. &startq;Cap|tain
Crowe (&s;aid he), you are then
determined to proceed in the cour&s;e
of knight-errantry?&endq; &startq;I am, (re|plied
the &s;eaman) with God's help,
d'ye &s;ee, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of wind
and weather&mdash;&endq; &startq;What, do'&s;t thou
talk of wind and weather! (cried the
knight, in an elevated tone of affect|ed
tran&s;port:) without the help of
Heaven, indeed, we are all vanity,
imbecility, weakne&s;s, and wretched|ne&s;s;
but if thou art re&s;olved to em|brace
the life of an errant, let me not
hear thee &s;o much as whi&s;per a doubt,
a wi&s;h, an hope, or &s;entiment, with
<PB N="5" REF="8">
re&s;pect to any other ob&s;tacle, which
wind or weather, fire or water, &s;word
or famine, danger or di&s;appointment,
may throw in the way of thy career.
&mdash;When the duty of thy profe&s;&s;ion
calls, thou mu&s;t &s;ingly ru&s;h upon in|numerable
ho&s;ts of armed men: thou
mu&s;t &s;torm the breach in the mouth
of batteries loaded with death and de|&s;truction,
while, every &s;tep thou move&s;t,
thou art expo&s;ed to the horrible ex|plo&s;ion
of &s;ubterranea$ mines, which,
being &s;prung, will whirl thee aloft in
air, a mangled cor&s;e, to feed the fowls
of heaven. Thou mu&s;t leap into the
aby&s;s of di&s;mal caves and caverns, re|plete
with poi&s;onous toads and hi&s;&s;ing
&s;erpents. Thou mu&s;t plunge into
&s;eas of burning &s;ulphur: thou mu&s;t
launch upon the ocean in a crazy bark,
when the foaming billows roll moun|tain
high, when the lightning fla&s;hes,
the thunder roars, and the howling
tempe&s;t blows, as if it would commix
the jarring elements of air and water,
earth and fire, and reduce all nature
to the original anarchy of chaos. Thus
<PB N="6" REF="9">
involved, thou mu&s;t turn thy prow
full again&s;t the fury of the &s;torm, and
&s;tem the boi&s;terous &s;urge to thy de|&s;tined
port, though at the di&s;tance of
a thou&s;and leagues&mdash;thou mu&s;t.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Ava&s;t, ava&s;t, brother, (exclaim|ed
the impatient Crowe) you've
got into the high latitudes, d'ye &s;ee:
&mdash;if &s;o be as you &s;pank it away at that
rate, adad, I can't continue in tow&mdash;
we mu&s;t ca&s;t off the rope, or 'ware
timbers.&mdash;As for your 'o&s;ts and
breeches, and hurling aloft, d'ye &s;ee,
your caves and caverns, whi&s;tling
tuoads and &s;erpents, burning brim|&s;tone
and foaming billows, we mu&s;t
take our hap; I value 'em not a rot|ten
ratline:&mdash;but, as for &s;ailing in the
wind's eye, brother, you mu&s;t give
me leave&mdash;no offence, I hope&mdash;I
pretend to be a thorough-bred &s;eaman,
d'ye &s;ee&mdash;and I'll be damned if you,
or e'er an arrant that broke bi&s;cuit ever
&s;ailed in a three-ma&s;t ve&s;&s;el within
five points of the wind, allowing for
variation and lee-way.&mdash;No, no,
brother, none of your tricks upon
<PB N="7" REF="10">
travellers&mdash;I a'n't now to learn my
compa&s;s.&endq; &startq;Tricks! (cried the
knight, &s;tarting up, and laying his
hand on the pummel of his &s;word)
what! &s;u&s;pect my honour!&endq;</P>
<P>Crowe, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be really
incen&s;ed, interrupted him with great
earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;aying, &startq;Nay, don't&mdash;
what a-pize!&mdash;adds-buntlines!&mdash;I
did'n't go to give you the lie, brother,
&s;mite my limbs: I only &s;aid as how
to &s;ail in the wind's eye was impo&s;&s;i|ble.&endq;
&startq;And I &s;ay unto thee, (re|&s;umed
the knight) nothing is impo&s;&s;i|ble
to a true knight-errant, in&s;pired
and animated by love.&endq; &startq;And I &s;ay
unto thee, (hollowed Crowe) if &s;o
be as how love pretends to turn his
haw&s;e-holes to the wind, he's no &s;ea|man
d'ye &s;ee, but a &s;notty-no&s;e lub|berly
boy, that knows not a cat from
a cap&s;tan&mdash;a-don't.&endq; &startq;He that
does not believe that love is an infalli|ble
pilot, mu&s;t not embark upon the
voyage of chivalry; for, next to the
protection of Heaven, it is from love
that the knight derives all his prowe&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="11">
and glory. The bare name of his
mi&s;tre&s;s invigorates his arm: the re|membrance
of her beauty infu&s;es in
his brea&s;t the mo&s;t heroic &s;entiments
of courage, while the idea of her
cha&s;tity hedges him round like a
charm, and renders him invulnerable
to the &s;word of his antagoni&s;t. A
knight without a mi&s;tre&s;s is a mere
non-entity, or at lea&s;t a mon&s;ter in
nature, a pilot without compa&s;s, a
&s;hip without rudder, and mu&s;t be dri|ven
to and fro upon the waves of di&s;|comfiture
and di&s;grace.&endq; &startq;An that
be all, (replied the &s;ailor) I told you
before as how I've got a &s;weet-heart,
as true a hearted girl as ever &s;wung
in canvas.&mdash;What tho'f &s;he may have
&s;tarted a hoop in rolling&mdash;that &s;ignifies
nothing&mdash;I'll warrant her tight as a
nut-&s;hell.&endq; &startq;She mu&s;t, in your
opinion, be a paragon either of beauty
or virtue. Now, as you have given
up the la&s;t, you mu&s;t uphold her
charms unequalled, and her per&s;on
without a parallel.&endq; &startq;I do, I
do uphold &s;he will &s;ail upon a
<PB N="9" REF="12">
parallel as well as e'er a frigate
that was rigged to the northward
of fifty.&endq; &startq;At that rate &s;he mu&s;t
rival the attractions of her whom
I adore, but that, I &s;ay, is impo&s;&s;i|ble:
the perfections of my Aurelia
are altogether &s;upernatural; and as
two &s;uns cannot &s;hine together in the
&s;ame &s;phere with equal &s;plendor, &s;o
I affirm, and will prove with my
body, that your mi&s;tre&s;s, in compa|ri&s;on
with mine, is as a glow-worm
to the meridian &s;un, a ru&s;h-light to
the full moon, or a &s;tale mackerel's
eye to a pearl of orient.&endq; &startq;Harkye,
brother, you might give good words,
however: an we once fall a-jawing,
d'ye &s;ee, I can heave out as much
bilge-water as another; and &s;ince you
be&s;mear my &s;weetheart Be&s;&s;elia, I can
as well bedaub your mi&s;tre&s;s Aurelia,
whom I value no more than old junk,
pork-&s;lu&s;h, or &s;tinking &s;tockfi&s;h.&endq;
&startq;Enough, enough&mdash;&s;uch bla&s;phemy
&s;hall not pa&s;s uncha&s;ti&s;ed. In con&s;i|deration
of our having fed from the
&s;ame table, and maintained together
a friendly, tho' &s;hort intercour&s;e, I
<PB N="10" REF="13">
will not demand the combat before
you are duly prepared. Proceed to
the fir&s;t great town, where you can
be furni&s;hed with hor&s;e and harne&s;&s;ing,
with arms offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive:
provide a tru&s;ty &s;quire, a&s;&s;ume a mot|to
and device&mdash;declare your&s;elf a &s;on
of chivalry; and proclaim the excel|lence
of her who rules your heart.
I &s;hall fetch a compa&s;s,; and where|&s;oever
we may chance to meet, let us
engage with equal arms in mortal
combat, that &s;hall decide and deter|mine
this di&s;pute.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, our adventurer &s;talked
with great &s;olemnity into another
apartment; while Crowe, being &s;uf|ficiently
irritated, &s;napped his fingers
in token of defiance. Hone&s;t Crowe
thought him&s;elf &s;curvily u&s;ed by a
man whom he had cultivated with
&s;uch humility of veneration; and,
after an incoherent ejaculation of &s;ea|oaths,
went in que&s;t of his nephew,
in order to make him acquainted with
this unlucky tran&s;action.</P>
<P>In the mean time Sir Launcelot,
having ordered &s;upper, retired into
<PB N="11" REF="14">
his own chamber, and gave a loo&s;e
to the mo&s;t tender emotions of his
heart. He recollected all the fond
ideas which had been excited in the
cour&s;e of his corre&s;pondence with
the charming Aurelia. He remem|bered,
with horror, the cruel letter
he had received from that young la|dy,
containing a formal renunciation
of his attachment, &s;o un&s;uitable to the
whole tenour of her character and
conduct. He revolved the late ad|venture
of the coach, and the decla|ration
of Mr. Clarke, with equal
eagerne&s;s and a&s;toni&s;hment; and was
&s;eized with the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire of
unravelling a my&s;tery &s;o intere&s;ting to
the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of his heart.
&mdash;All the&s;e mingled con&s;iderations
produced a kind of ferment in the
oeconomy of his mind, which &s;ub|&s;ided
into a profound reverie, com|pounded
of hope and perplexity.</P>
<P>From this trance he was waked
by the arrival of his &s;quire, who en|tered
the room with the blood trick|ling
over his no&s;e, and &s;tood before
<PB N="12" REF="15">
him without &s;peaking. When the
knight a&s;ked who&s;e livery was that he
wore, he replied, &startq;'Tis your ho|nour's
own livery:&mdash;I received it on
your account, and hope as you will
quit the &s;core.&endq; Then he proceeded
to inform his ma&s;ter, that two officers
of the army having come into the
kitchen, in&s;i&s;ted upon having for their
&s;upper the victuals which Sir Launce|lot
had be&s;poke; and that he, the
&s;quire, objecting to the propo&s;al, one
of them had &s;eized the poker, and
ba&s;ted him with his own blood; that
when he told them he belonged to a
knight-errant, and threatened them
with the vengeance of his ma&s;ter,
they cur&s;ed and abu&s;ed him, calling
him Sancho Panza, and &s;uch dogs
names; and bade him tell his ma&s;ter
Don Quick&s;ot, that, if he made any
noi&s;e, they would confine him to his
cage, and lie with his mi&s;tre&s;s Dul|cinea.
&startq;To be &s;ure, Sir, (&s;aid he)
they thought you as great a nincom|poop
as your &s;quire&mdash;trim tram; like
ma&s;ter, like man;&mdash;but I hope as
<PB N="13" REF="16">
how you will give them a Rowland
for their Oliver.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mi&s;creant! (cried the knight)
you have provoked the gentlemen
with your impertinence, and they
have cha&s;ti&s;ed you as you de&s;erve.
I tell thee, Crab&s;haw, they have
&s;aved me the trouble of puni&s;hing
thee with my own hands; and well
it is for thee, &s;inner as thou art, that
they them&s;elves have performed the
office: for, had they complained to
me of thy in&s;olence and ru&s;ticity, by
Heaven! I would have made thee an
example to all the impudent &s;quires
upon the face of the earth. Hence
then, avaunt, caitif.&mdash;Let his ma|je&s;ty's
officers, who are perhaps fa|tigued
with hard duty in the &s;ervice
of their country, comfort them&s;elves
with the &s;upper which was intended
for me, and leave me undi&s;turbed to
my own meditations.&endq;</P>
<P>Timothy did not require a repeti|tion
of this command, which he
forthwith obeyed, growling within
him&s;elf, that thence-forward he
<PB N="14" REF="17">
&s;hould let every cuckold wear his own
horns; but he could not help enter|taining
&s;ome doubts with re&s;pect to
the courage of his ma&s;ter, who, he
&s;uppo&s;ed, was one of tho&s;e Hectors
who have their fighting days, but are
not at all times equally prepared for
the combat.</P>
<P>The knight, having taken a &s;light
repa&s;t, retired to his repo&s;e; and had
for &s;ome time enjoyed a very agree|able
&s;lumber, when he was &s;tart|led
by a knocking at his chamber-door.
&startq;I beg your honour's pardon,
(&s;aid the landlady) but there are two
uncivil per&s;ons in the kitchen, who
have well nigh turned my whole
hou&s;e top&s;y-turvy. Not contented
with laying violent hands on your
honour's &s;upper, they want to be
rude to two young ladies who are ju&s;t
arrived, and have called for a po&s;t|chai&s;e
to go on. They are afraid to
open their chamber-door to get out&mdash;
and the young lawyer is like to be
murdered for taking the ladies part.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18">
Sir Launcelot, though he refu&s;ed
to take notice of the in&s;ult which had
been offered to him&s;elf, no &s;ooner
heard of the di&s;tre&s;s of the ladies
than he &s;tarted up, huddled on his
cloaths, and, girding his &s;word to his
loins, advanced with a deliberate pace
to the kitchen, where he perceived
Thomas Clarke warmly engaged in
altercation with a couple of young
men dre&s;&s;ed in regimentals, who, with
a peculiar air of arrogance and fero|city,
treated him with great in&s;olence
and contempt. Tom was endeavour|ing
to per&s;uade them, that, in the
con&s;titution of England, the military
was always &s;ub&s;ervient to the civil
power; and that their behaviour to a
couple of helple&s;s young women was
not only unbecoming gentlemen, but
expre&s;ly contrary to the law, ina&s;much
as they might be &s;ued for an a&s;&s;ault on
an action of damages.</P>
<P>To this remon&s;trance the two he|roes
in red replied by a volley of dread|ful
oaths, intermingled with threats,
which put the lawyer in &s;ome pain
<PB N="16" REF="19">
for his ears. While one thus endea|voured
to intimidate hone&s;t Tom
Clarke, the other thundered at the
door of the apartment to which the
ladies had retired, demanding admit|tance,
but received no other an&s;wer
than a loud &s;hriek. Our adventurer
advancing to this uncivil champion,
acco&s;ted him thus in a grave and &s;o|lemn
tone: &startq;A&s;&s;uredly I could not
have believed, except upon the evi|dence
of my own &s;en&s;es, that per&s;ons
who have the appearance of gentle|men,
and bear his maje&s;ty's ho|nourable
commi&s;&s;ion in the army,
could behave &s;o wide of the decorum
due to &s;ociety, of a proper re&s;pect to
the laws, of that humanity which we
owe to our fellow-creatures, and that
delicate regard for the fair-&s;ex, which
ought to prevail in the brea&s;t of every
gentleman, and which in particular
dignifies the character of a &s;oldier.
To whom &s;hall that weaker tho' more
amiable part of the creation, fly for
protection, if they are in&s;ulted and
outraged by tho&s;e who&s;e more imme|diate
<PB N="17" REF="20">
duty is it to afford them &s;ecurity
and defence from injury and vio|lence?
What right have you, or any
man upon earth, to excite riot in a
public inn, which may be deemed a
temple &s;acred to ho&s;pitality, to di&s;turb
the quiet of your fellow-gue&s;ts, &s;ome
of them perhaps exhau&s;ted by fatigue,
&s;ome of them invaded by di&s;temper,
to interrupt the king's lieges in their
cour&s;e of journeying upon their law|ful
occa&s;ions? Above all, what mo|tive
but wanton barbarity, could
prompt you to violate the apartment,
and terrify the tender hearts of two
helple&s;s young ladies travelling no doubt
upon &s;ome cruel emergency, which
compels them unattended to encoun|ter
in the night the dangers of the
highway.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Heark ye, Don Bethlem, (&s;aid
the captain, &s;trutting up and cocking
his hat in the face of our adventurer)
you may be as mad as e'er a &s;traw|crowned
monarch in Moorfields, for
aught I care; but damme! don't you
be &s;aucy, otherwi&s;e I &s;hall dub your

conceive the appearance that was now
exhibited by the vi&s;age of the feroci|ous

his own, which was of un|con&s;cionable

as a &s;tatue, &s;taring with the

Sir (&s;aid the other) we are no officers,

The knight &s;aid he was very glad,
for the honour of the &s;ervice, to find
they were impo&s;tors; tho' they de|&s;erved
to be cha&s;ti&s;ed for arrogating to
them&s;elves an honourable character,
which they had not &s;pirit to &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>The&s;e words were &s;carce pronoun|ced,
when Mr. Clarke approaching
one of the bravadoes, who had
threatened to crop his ears, be&s;towed
&s;uch a benediction on his jaw, as he
could not receive without immediate
humiliation; while Timothy Crab|&s;haw,
&s;marting from his broken-head
and his want of &s;upper, &s;aluted the
other with a York&s;hire hug, that
layed him acro&s;s the body of his com|panion.
In a word, the two p&s;eudo|officers
were very roughly handled
for their pre&s;umption in pretending
to act characters for which they were
&s;o ill qualified.</P>
<P>While Clarke and Crab&s;haw were
thus laudably employed, the two
young ladies pa&s;&s;ed through the
kitchen &s;o &s;uddenly, that the knight
had only a tran&s;ient glimp&s;e of their
<PB N="21" REF="24">
backs, and they di&s;appeared before
he could po&s;&s;ibly make a tender of
his &s;ervices. The truth is, they dread|ed
nothing &s;o much as their being di&s;|covered,
and took the fir&s;t opportu|nity
of gliding into the chai&s;e, which
had been for &s;ome time waiting in the
pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Mr. Clarke was much more di&s;|concerted
than our adventurer, by
their &s;udden e&s;cape. He ran with
great eagerne&s;s to the door, and, per|ceiving
they were flown, returned to
Sir Launcelot, &s;aying, &startq;Lord ble&s;s my
&s;oul, Sir, didn't you &s;ee who it was?&endq;
&startq;Hah! how! (exclaimed the knight,
reddening with alarm) who was it?&endq;
&startq;One of them (replied the lawyer)
was Dolly, our old landlady's daugh|ter
at the Black Lyon.&mdash;I knew her
when fir&s;t &s;he lighted, notwith&s;tand|ing
her being neatly dre&s;&s;ed in a green
jo&s;eph, which, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, Sir,
becomes her remarkably well.&mdash;I'd
never de&s;ire to &s;ee a prettier creature.
As for the other, &s;he's a very genteel
woman; but whether old or young,
<PB N="22" REF="25">
ugly or hand&s;ome, I can't pretend to
&s;ay; for &s;he was ma&s;qued.&mdash;I had ju&s;t
time to &s;alute Dolly, and a&s;k a few
que&s;tions;&mdash;but all &s;he could tell me
was, that the ma&s;qued lady's name
was Mi&s;s Meadows; and that &s;he,
Dolly, was hired as her waiting-wo|man.&endq;</P>
<P>When the name of Meadows was
mentioned, Sir Launcelot, who&s;e
&s;pirits had been in violent commo|tion,
became &s;uddenly calm and &s;e|rene,
and he began to communicate
to Clarke the dialogue which had
pa&s;&s;ed between him and captain
Crowe, when the ho&s;te&s;s, addre&s;&s;ing
her&s;elf to our errant, &startq;Well, (&s;aid
&s;he) I have had the honour to ac|commodate
many ladies of the fir&s;t
fa&s;hion at the White Hart, both young
and old, proud and lowly, ordinary
and hand&s;ome; but &s;uch a miracle as
Mi&s;s Meadows I never yet did &s;ee.
Lord, let me never thrive but I think
&s;he is of &s;omething more than a hu|man
creature.&mdash;O, had your honour
but &s;et eyes on her, you would have
<PB N="23" REF="26">
&s;aid it was a vi&s;ion from Heaven, a
cherubim of beauty:&mdash;for my part,
I can hardly think it was any thing
but a dream:&mdash;then &s;o meek, &s;o mild,
&s;o good-natured and generous! I &s;ay,

poor dear young lady! &s;he &s;eems to

looked for all the world like orient
pearl.&endq;</P>

able to conceive the &s;ea of agitation on
which our adventurer was to&s;&s;ed all
night long, without repo&s;e or inter|mi&s;&s;ion.
Sometimes he re&s;olved to
employ all his indu&s;try and addre&s;s in
di&s;covering the place in which Aurelia
was &s;eque&s;tred, that he might re&s;cue
her from the &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;traint to
which &s;he had been &s;ubjected. But,
when his heart beat high with the an|ticipation
of this exploit, he was &s;ud|denly

checked, by the remembrance of that
fatal letter, written and &s;igned by her
own hand, which had divorced him
from all hope, and fir&s;t un&s;ettled his
under&s;tanding. The emotions waked
by this remembrance were &s;o &s;trong,
that he leaped from the bed, and, the
fire being &s;till burning in the chimney,
lighted a candle, that he might once
more banquet his &s;pleen by reading the
original billet, which, together with
the ring he had received from Mi&s;s
Darnel's mother, he kept in a &s;mall
box, carefully depo&s;ited within his
portmanteau. This being in&s;tantly
<PB N="25" REF="28">
unlocked, he unfolded the paper,
and recited the contents in the&s;e

<P>&startq;Sir, Obliged as I am by the pa&s;|&s;ion

with which you endeavour to give me

been to tho&s;e whom I thought it my

and how&s;oever you may have
been flattered by the &s;eeming compla|cency

to &s;peak in a deci&s;ive &s;train, to
a&s;&s;ure you, that, without &s;acrificing my

that your regard for me will be be&s;t
&s;hewn by your de&s;i&s;ting from a pur|&s;uit,

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Having pronounced aloud the words
that compo&s;ed this di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, he ha|&s;tily
replaced the cruel &s;croll; and,
being too well acquainted with the
hand to harbour the lea&s;t doubt of its
being genuine, threw him&s;elf into his
bed in a tran&s;port of de&s;pair, mingled
with re&s;entment; during the predo|minancy
of which, he determined to
proceed in the career of adventure, and
endeavour to forget the unkindne&s;s of
his mi&s;tre&s;s, amid&s;t the avocations of
knight-errantry. Such was the re&s;o|lution
that governed his thoughts,
when he ro&s;e in the morning, ordered
Crab&s;haw to &s;addle Bronzomarte, and
demanded a bill of his expence. Be|fore
the&s;e orders could be executed,
the good woman of the hou&s;e, enter|ing
his apartment, told him, with
marks of concern, that the poor young
lady, Mi&s;s Meadows, had dropped her
<PB N="27" REF="30">
pocket-book in the next chamber,
where it was found by the ho&s;te&s;s,
who now pre&s;ented it unopened.</P>
<P>Our knight, having called in Mrs.
Oakley and her &s;on as witne&s;&s;es, un|folded
the book, without reading one
&s;yllable of the contents, and found in
it five bank-notes, amounting to two
hundred and thirty pounds. Per|ceiving,
at once, that the lo&s;s of this
trea&s;ure might be attended with the
mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ing con&s;equences to the
owner, and reflecting that this was a
ca&s;e which demanded the immediate
interpo&s;ition and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of chivalry,
he declared, that he him&s;elf would
convey it &s;afely into the hands of Mi&s;s
Meadows; and de&s;ired to know the
road &s;he had pur&s;ued, that he might
&s;et out in que&s;t of her, without a mo|ment's
delay. It was not without
&s;ome difficulty that this information
was obtained from the po&s;t-boy, who
had been enjoined &s;ecrecy by the lady,
and even gratified with a hand&s;ome re|ward
for his promi&s;ed di&s;cretion. The
&s;ame method was u&s;ed to make him
<PB N="28" REF="31">
di&s;gorge his tru&s;t: he undertook to
conduct Sir Launcelot, who hired a
po&s;t-chai&s;e for di&s;patch, and imme|diately
departed, after having directed
his &s;quire to follow his tract with the
hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Yet, whatever ha&s;te he made, it is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the reader's &s;a|tisfaction,
that we &s;hould out&s;trip the
chai&s;e, and vi&s;it the ladies before his
arrival. We &s;hall therefore, without
circumlocution, premi&s;e, that Mi&s;s
Meadows was no other than that pa|ragon
of beauty and goodne&s;s, the all-accompli&s;hed
Mi&s;s Aurelia Darnel.
She had, with that meekne&s;s of re&s;ig|nation
peculiar to her&s;elf, for &s;ome
years &s;ubmitted to every &s;pecies of
oppre&s;&s;ion which her uncle's tyranny
of di&s;po&s;ition could plan, and his un|limited
power of guardian&s;hip execute,
till, at length, it ro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch
of de&s;poti&s;m as &s;he could not endure.
He had projected a match between
his niece and one Philip Sycamore,
E&s;&abque; a young man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
pretty con&s;iderable e&s;tate in the North
<PB N="29" REF="32">
Country; who liked Aurelia's per&s;on,
but was enamoured of her fortune,
and had offered to purcha&s;e Anthony's
intere&s;t and alliance with certain con|ce&s;&s;ions,
which could not but be agree|able
to a man of loo&s;e principles, who
would have found it a difficult ta&s;k to
&s;ettle the accounts of his ward&s;hip.</P>
<P>According to the pre&s;ent e&s;timate
of matrimonial felicity, Sycamore
might have found admittance as a fu|ture
&s;on-in-law in any private family
of the kingdom. He was by birth a
gentleman, tall, &s;traight, and mu&s;cu|lar,
with a fair, &s;leek, unmeaning face,
that promi&s;ed more &s;implicity than ill-nature.
His education had not been
neglected, and he inherited an e&s;tate of
five thou&s;and a year. Mi&s;s Darnel,
however, had penetration enough to
di&s;cover and de&s;pi&s;e him as a &s;trange
compo&s;ition of rapacity and profu&s;ion,
ab&s;urdity and good-&s;en&s;e, ba&s;hfulne&s;s
and impudence, &s;elf-conceit and diffi|dence,
aukwardne&s;s and o&s;tentation,
in&s;olence and good-nature, ra&s;hne&s;s
and timidity. He was continually &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="30" REF="33">
and preyed upon by certain
vermin called led-captains and buf|foons,
who &s;hewed him in leading-&s;trings
like a &s;ucking giant, rifled his
pockets without ceremony, ridiculed
him to his face, traduced his charac|ter,
and expo&s;ed him in a thou&s;and lu|dicrous
attitudes for the diver&s;ion of
the public; while, all the time, he
knew their knavery, &s;aw their drift,
dete&s;ted their morals, and de&s;pi&s;ed
their under&s;tanding. He was &s;o infa|tuated
by indolence of thought, and
communication with folly, that he
would have rather &s;uffered him&s;elf to
be led into a ditch with company, than
be at the pains of going over a bridge
alone; and involved him&s;elf in a thou|&s;and
difficulties, the natural con&s;e|quences
of an error in the fir&s;t con|coction,
which, though he plainly &s;aw
it, he had not re&s;olution enough to
avoid.</P>
<P>Such was the character of &s;quire Sy|camore,
who profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf the ri|val
of Sir Launcelot Greaves in the good
graces of Mi&s;s Aurelia Darnel. He
<PB N="31" REF="34">
had in this pur&s;uit per&s;evered with
more con&s;tancy and fortitude, than he
ever exerted in any other in&s;tance.
Being generally needy, from extrava|gance,
he was &s;timulated by his
wants, and animated by his vanity,
which was artfully in&s;tigated by his
followers, who hoped to &s;hare the
&s;poils of his &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e motives
were reinforced by the ince&s;&s;ant and
eager exhortations of Anthony Darnel,
who, &s;eeing his ward in the la&s;t year
of her minority, thought there was no
time to be lo&s;t in &s;ecuring his own in|demnification,
and &s;natching his niece
for ever from the hopes of Sir Launce|lot,
whom he now hated with redou|bled
animo&s;ity. Finding Aurelia deaf
to all his remon&s;trances, proof again&s;t
ill-u&s;age, and re&s;olutely aver&s;e to the
propo&s;ed union with Sycamore, he en|deavoured
to detach her thoughts
from Sir Launcelot, by forging tales to
the prejudice of his con&s;tancy and mo|ral
character; and, finally, by recapi|tulating
the proofs and in&s;tances of his
di&s;traction, wh$ch he particularized
<PB N="32" REF="35">
with the mo&s;t malicious exaggera|tions.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all his arts, he found it
impracticable to &s;urmount her objec|tions
to the purpo&s;ed alliance, and
therefore changed his battery. In|&s;tead
of transferring her to the arms of
his friend, he re&s;olved to detain her in
his own power by a legal claim, which
would inve&s;t him with the uncon|trouled
management of her affairs.
This was a charge of lunacy, in con|&s;equence
of which he hoped to obtain
a commi&s;&s;ion, to &s;ecure a jury to his
wi&s;h, and be appointed &s;ole committee
of her per&s;on, as well as &s;teward on
her e&s;tate, of which he would then be
heir apparent. As the fir&s;t &s;teps to|wards
the execution of this hone&s;t
&s;cheme, he had &s;ubjected Aurelia to
the &s;uperintendency and direction of
an old duenna, who had been for|merly
the procure&s;s of his plea&s;ures;
and hired a new &s;et of &s;ervants, who
were given to under&s;tand, at their fir&s;t
admi&s;&s;ion, that the young lady was
di&s;ordered in her brain.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36">
An impre&s;&s;ion of this nature is ea&s;ily
pre&s;erved among &s;ervants, when the
ma&s;ter of the family thinks his intere&s;t
is concerned in &s;upporting the im|po&s;ture.
The melancholy produced
from her confinement, and the viva|city
of her re&s;entment under ill-u&s;age,
were, by the addre&s;s of Anthony,
and the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dome&s;ticks,
perverted into the effects of in&s;anity;
and the &s;ame interpretation was &s;trained
upon her mo&s;t indifferent words and
actions. The tydings of Mi&s;s Darnel's
di&s;order were carefully circulated in
whi&s;pers, and &s;oon reached the ears
of Mr. Sycamore, who was not at all
plea&s;ed with the information. From
his knowledge of Anthony's di&s;po&s;i|tion,
he &s;u&s;pected the truth of the re|port;
and unwilling to &s;ee &s;uch a
prize ravi&s;hed, as it were, from his
gra&s;p, he, with the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of his myrmidons, re&s;olved to &s;et the
captive at liberty, in full hope of turn|ing
the adventure to his own advan|tage:
for he argued in this manner:
&startq;If &s;he is in fact <HI>compos mentis,</HI> her
<PB N="34" REF="37">
gratitude will opetate in my behalf,
and even prudence will advi&s;e her to
embrace the proffered a&s;ylum from
the villany of her uncle. If &s;he is
really di&s;ordered, it will be no great
difficulty to deceive her into a mar|riage,
and then I become her tru&s;tee
of cour&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>The plan was well conceived; but
Sycamore had not di&s;cretion enough
to keep his own coun&s;el. From
weakne&s;s and vanity, he blabbed the
de&s;ign, which in a little time was
communicated to Anthony Darnel;
and he took his precautions accord|ingly.
Being infirm in his own per|&s;on,
and con&s;equently unfit for oppo|&s;ing
the violence of &s;ome de&s;peradoes,
whom he knew to be the &s;atellites of
Sycamore, he prepared a private re|treat
for his ward at the hou&s;e of an
old gentleman, the companion of his
youth, whom he had impo&s;ed upon
with the fiction of her being di&s;ordered
in her under&s;tanding, and amu&s;ed
with a &s;tory of a dangerous de&s;ign
upon her per&s;on. Thus cautioned and
<PB N="35" REF="38">
in&s;tructed, the gentleman had gone
with his own coach and &s;ervants to re|ceive
Aurelia and her governante at a
third hou&s;e, to which &s;he had been
privately removed from her uncle's
habitation; and in this journey it was,
that &s;he had been &s;o accidentally pro|tected
from the violence of the robbers
by the interpo&s;ition and prowe&s;s of
our adventurer.</P>
<P>As he did not wear his helmet in
that exploit, &s;he recognized his fea|tures
as he pa&s;&s;ed the coach, and,
&s;truck with the apparition, &s;hrieked a|loud.
She had been a&s;&s;ured by her
guardian, that his de&s;ign was to con|vey
her to her own hou&s;e; but per|ceiving,
in the &s;equel, that the car|riage
&s;truck off upon a different road,
and finding her&s;elf in the hands of
&s;trangers, &s;he began to dread a much
more di&s;agreeable fate, and conceive
doubts and ideas that filled her tender
heart with horror and affliction. When
&s;he expo&s;tulated with the duenna, &s;he
was treated like a changeling, admo|ni&s;hed
to be quiet, and reminded that
<PB N="36" REF="39">
&s;he was under the direction of tho&s;e
who would manage her with a tender
regard to her own welfare, and the
honour of her family. When &s;he ad|dre&s;&s;ed
her&s;elf to the old gentleman,
who was not much &s;ubject to the emo|tions
of humanity, and be&s;ides firmly
per&s;uaded that &s;he was deprived of her
rea&s;on, he made no an&s;wer; but laid
his finger on his mouth, by way of
enjoining &s;ilence.</P>
<P>This my&s;terious behaviour aggrava|ted
the fears of the poor haple&s;s young
lady; and her terrors waxed &s;o &s;trong,
that when &s;he &s;aw Tom Clarke, who&s;e
face &s;he knew, &s;he called aloud for
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and even pronounced the
name of his patron Sir Launcelot
Greaves, which &s;he imagined might
&s;timulate him the more to attempt
&s;omething for her deliverance.</P>
<P>The reader has already been in|formed
in what manner the endeavours
of Tom and his uncle mi&s;carried.
Mi&s;s Darnel's new keeper having, in
the cour&s;e of his journey, halted for
refre&s;hment at the Black Lyon, of
<PB N="37" REF="40">
which being landlord, he believed the
good woman and her family were in|tirely
devoted to his will and plea&s;ure,
Aurelia found an opportunity of &s;peak|ing
in private to Dolly, who had a
very prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing appearance. She
conveyed a pur&s;e of money into the
hands of this young woman, telling
her, while the tears trickled down her
cheeks, that &s;he was a young lady of
fortune, in danger, as &s;he apprehended,
of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. This hint, which &s;he
communicated in a whi&s;per, while the
governante &s;tood at the other end of
the room, was &s;ufficient to intere&s;t
the compa&s;&s;ionate Dolly in her behalf.
As &s;oon as the coach departed, &s;he
made her mother acquainted with the
tran&s;action; and as they naturally con|cluded
that the young lady expected
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they re&s;olved to ap|prove
them&s;elves worthy of her confi|dence.</P>
<P>Dolly having inli&s;ted in their de&s;ign
a tru&s;ty countryman, one of her own
profe&s;&s;ed admirers, they &s;et out toge|ther
for the hou&s;e of the gentleman in
<PB N="38" REF="41">
which the fair pri&s;oner was confined,
and waited for her in &s;ecret at the end
of a plea&s;ant park, in which they na|turally
concluded &s;he might be in|dulged
with the privilege of taking the
air. The event ju&s;tified their con|ception:
on the very fir&s;t day of their
watch they &s;aw her approach, accom|panied
by her duenna. Dolly and her
attendant immediately tied their hor&s;es
to a &s;take, and retired into a thicket,
which Aurelia did not fail to enter.
Dolly forthwith appeared, and, taking
her by the hand, led her to the hor&s;es,
one of which &s;he mounted in the ut|mo&s;t
hurry and trepidation, while the
countryman bound the duenna with a
cord, prepared for the purpo&s;e, gagged
her mouth, and tied her to a tree,
where he left her to her own medita|tions.
Then he mounted before Dolly,
and through unfrequented paths con|ducted
his charge to an inn on the po&s;t|road,
where a chai&s;e was ready for
their reception.</P>
<P>As he refu&s;ed to proceed farther,
le&s;t his ab&s;ence from his own home
<PB N="39" REF="42">
&s;hould create &s;u&s;picion, Aurelia re|warded
him liberally; but would not
part with her faithful Dolly, who, in|deed,
had no inclination to be di&s;|charged:
&s;uch an affection and at|tachment
had &s;he already acquired for
the amiable fugitive, though &s;he knew
neither her &s;tory, nor her true name.
Aurelia thought proper to conceal
both, and a&s;&s;umed the fictitious ap|pellation
of Meadows, until &s;he &s;hould
be better acquainted with the di&s;po&s;i|tion
and di&s;cretion of her new atten|dant.
The fir&s;t re&s;olution &s;he could
take in the pre&s;ent flutter of her &s;pirits,
was to make the be&s;t of her way to
London, where &s;he thought &s;he might
find an a&s;ylum in the hou&s;e of a fe|male
relation, married to an eminent
phy&s;ician, known by the name of
Kawdle. In the execution of this ha&s;ty
re&s;olve, &s;he travelled at a violent rate,
from &s;tage to &s;tage, in a carriage drawn
by four hor&s;es, without halting for ne|ce&s;&s;ary
refre&s;hment or repo&s;e, until &s;he
judged her&s;elf out of danger of being
overtaken. As &s;he appeared over|whelmed
<PB N="40" REF="43">
with grief and con&s;ternation
the good-natured Dolly endeavoured
to alleviate her di&s;tre&s;s with diverting
di&s;cour&s;e; and, among other le&s;s in|tere&s;ting
&s;tories, entertained her with
the adventures of Sir Launcelot and
captain Crowe, which &s;he had &s;een
and heard recited while they remained
at the Black Lyon: nor did &s;he fail
to introduce Mr. Thomas Clarke, in
her narrative, with &s;uch a favourable
repre&s;entation of his per&s;on and cha|racter,
as plainly di&s;covered that her
own heart had received a rude &s;hock
from the irre&s;i&s;tible force of his qua|lifications.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Sir Launcelot
Greaves was a theme which effec|tually
fixed the attention of Aurelia,
di&s;tracted as her ideas mu&s;t have been
by the circum&s;tances of her pre&s;ent
&s;ituation. The particulars of his con|duct,
&s;ince the corre&s;pondence be|tween
her and him had cea&s;ed, &s;he
heard with equal concern and a&s;to|ni&s;hment;
for, how far &s;oever &s;he
deemed her&s;elf detached from all
<PB N="41" REF="44">
po&s;&s;ibility of future connexion with
that young gentleman, &s;he was not
made of &s;uch indifferent &s;tuff, as to
learn without emotion the calamitous
di&s;order of an accompli&s;hed youth,
who&s;e axtraordinary virtues &s;he could
not but revere.</P>
<P>As they had deviated from the
po&s;t-road, taken precautions to con|ceal
their route, and made &s;uch pro|gre&s;s,
that they were now within one
day's journey of London, the careful
and affectionate Dolly &s;eeing her dear
lady quite exhau&s;ted with fatigue, u&s;ed
all her natural rhetoric, which was very
powerful, mingled with tears that
flowed from the heart, in per&s;uading
Aurelia to enjoy &s;ome repo&s;e; and &s;o
far &s;he &s;ucceeded in the attempt, that
for one night the toil of travelling was
intermitted. This rece&s;s from incre|dible
fatigue, was a pau&s;e that afford|ed
our adventurer time to overtake
them before they reached the metro|polis,
that va&s;t labyrinth, in which
Aurelia might have been for ever lo&s;t
to his inquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="45">
It was in the afternoon of the day
which &s;ucceeded his departure from
the White Hart, that Sir Launcelot
arrived at the inn, where Mi&s;s Aurelia
Darnel had be&s;poke a di&s;h of tea, and
a po&s;t-chai&s;e for the next &s;tage. He
had, by inquiry, traced her a con|&s;iderable
way, without ever dream|ing
who the per&s;on really was whom
he thus pur&s;ued, and now he de&s;ired
to &s;peak with her attendant. Dolly
was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee Sir
Launcelot Greaves, of who&s;e charac|ter
&s;he had conceived a very &s;ublime
idea, from the narrative of Mr
Thomas Clarke; but &s;he was &s;till
more &s;urpri&s;ed when he gave her to
under&s;tand, that he had charged him|&s;elf
with the pocket-book, contain|ing
the bank-notes, which Mi&s;s Mea|dows
had dropped in the hou&s;e where
they had been threatened with in&s;ult.
Mi&s;s Darnel had not yet di&s;covered
her di&s;a&s;ter, when her attendant, run|ning
into the apartment, pre&s;ented
the prize, which &s;he had received
from our adventurer, with his com|pliments
<PB N="43" REF="46">
to Mi&s;s Meadows, implying
a reque&s;t to be admitted into her pre|&s;ence,
that he might make a per&s;onal
tender of his be&s;t &s;ervices.</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the
amiable Aurelia heard unmoved &s;uch
a me&s;&s;age from a per&s;on, whom her
maid di&s;covered to be the very iden|tical
Sir Launcelot Greaves, who&s;e
&s;tory &s;he had &s;o lately related: but as
the en&s;uing &s;cene requires fre&s;h at|tention
in the reader, we &s;hall defer
it till another opportunity, when his
&s;pirits &s;hall be recruited from the fa|tigue
of this chapter.</P>

<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Exhibiting an interview, which it is to
be hoped, will intere&s;t the curio&s;ity of
the reader.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind of the delicate Au|relia
was &s;trangely agitated by
the intelligence which &s;he received,
with her pocket-book, from Dolly.
Confounded as &s;he was by the nature
of her &s;ituation, &s;he at once perceived
<PB N="44" REF="47">
that &s;he could not, with any regard to
the dictates of gratitude, refu&s;e com|plying
with the reque&s;t of Sir Launce|lot;
but, in the fir&s;t hurry of her
emotion, &s;he directed Dolly to beg,
in her name, that &s;he might be ex|cu&s;ed
for wearing a ma&s;que at the in|terview
which he de&s;ired, as &s;he had
particular rea&s;ons, which concerned
her peace, for retaining that di&s;gui&s;e.
Our adventurer &s;ubmitted to this pre|liminary
with a good grace, as he had
nothing in view but the injunctions of
his order, and the duties of humani|ty;
and he was admitted without fur|ther
preamble. When he entered the
room, he could not help being &s;truck
with the pre&s;ence of Aurelia. Her
&s;tature was improved &s;ince he had
&s;een her; her &s;hape was exqui&s;itely
formed; and &s;he received him with
an air of dignity, which impre&s;&s;ed
him with a very &s;ublime idea of her
per&s;on and character. She was no
le&s;s affected at the &s;ight of our adven|turer,
who, though ca&s;ed in armour,
appeared with his head uncovered;
<PB N="45" REF="48">
and the exerci&s;e of travelling had
thrown &s;uch a glow of health and
vivacity on his features, which were
naturally elegant and expre&s;&s;ive, that
we will venture to &s;ay, there was not
in all England a couple that excelled
this amiable pair in per&s;onal beauty
and accompli&s;hments. Aurelia &s;hone
with all the fabled graces of nymph
or godde&s;s; and to Sir Launcelot
might be applied what the divine
poet Ario&s;to &s;ays of the prince Zer|bino:
<Q>Natura il fece e poi ruppe la &s;tampa.</Q></P>
<Q>&startq;When Nature &s;tamp'd him, &s;he
the dye de&s;troy'd.'</Q>
<P>Our adventurer, having made his
obei&s;ance to this &s;uppo&s;ed Mi&s;s Mea|dows,
told her, with an air of plea|&s;antry,
that altho' he thought him&s;elf
highly honoured in being admitted to
her pre&s;ence, and allowed to pay his
re&s;pects to her, as &s;uperior beings are
adored, un&s;een; yet his plea&s;ure
<PB N="46" REF="49">
would receive a very con&s;iderable ad|dition,
if &s;he would be plea&s;ed to
withdraw that invidious veil, that he
might have a glimp&s;e of the divinity
which it concealed. Aurelia imme|diately
took off her ma&s;que, &s;aying,
with a faultering accent, &startq;I cannot
be &s;o ungrateful as to deny &s;uch a
&s;mall favour to a gentleman who has
laid me under the mo&s;t important ob|ligations.&endq;</P>
<P>The unexpected apparition of Mi&s;s
Aurelia Darnel, beaming with all the
emanations of ripened beauty, blu&s;hing
with all the graces of the mo&s;t lovely
confu&s;ion, could not but produce a
violent effect upon the mind of Sir
Launcelot Greaves. He was, indeed,
overwhelmed with a mingled tran&s;|port
of a&s;toni&s;hment, admiration,
affliction, and awe. The colour va|ni&s;hed
from his cheeks, and he &s;tood
gazing upon her, in &s;ilence, with the
mo&s;t emphatic expre&s;&s;ion of counte|nance.
Aurelia was infected by his
di&s;order: &s;he began to tremble, and
the ro&s;es fluctuated on her face.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="50">
&startq;I cannot forget (&s;aid &s;he) that I
owe my life to the courage and hu|manity
of Sir Launcelot Greaves, and
that he at the &s;ame time re&s;cued from
the mo&s;t dreadful death a dear and ve|nerable
parent.&endq; &startq;Would to heaven
&s;he &s;till &s;urvived! (cried our adven|turer
with great emotion.) She was
the friend of my youth, the kind pa|trone&s;s
of my felicity! my guardian
angel for&s;ook me when &s;he expired!
her la&s;t injunctions are deep engraven
on my heart!&endq;</P>
<P>While he pronounced the&s;e words
&s;he lifted her handkerchief to her fair
eyes, and, after &s;ome pau&s;e, proceed|ed
in a tremulous tone, &startq;I hope, Sir
&mdash;I hope you have&mdash;I &s;hould be &s;orry
&mdash;pardon me, Sir, I cannot reflect
upon &s;uch an intere&s;ting &s;ubject un|moved&mdash;&endq;
Here &s;he fetched a deep
&s;igh, that was accompanied with a
flood of tears; while the knight con|tinued
to bend his eyes upon her with
the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s of attention.
Having recollected her&s;elf a little,
&s;he endeavoured to &s;hift the conver|&s;ation:
<PB N="48" REF="51">
&startq;You have been abroad &s;ince
I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee you&mdash;I hope
you were agreeably amu&s;ed in your
travels.&endq; &startq;No, madam, (&s;aid our
hero, drooping his head) I have been
unfortunate.&endq; When &s;he, with the
mo&s;t enchanting &s;weetne&s;s of bene|volence,
expre&s;&s;ed her concern to
hear he had been unhappy, and her
hope that his misfortunes were not
pa&s;t remedy; he lifted up his eyes,
and fixing them upon her again with
a look of tender dejection, &startq;Cut off
(&s;aid he) from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what
my &s;oul held mo&s;t dear, I wi&s;hed for
death, and was vi&s;ited by di&s;traction.
&mdash;I have been abandoned by my rea|&s;on
&mdash;my youth is for ever bla&s;ted.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>The tender heart of Aurelia could
bear no more&mdash;her knees began to
totter: the lu&s;tre vani&s;hed from her
eyes, and &s;he fainted in the arms of
her attendant. Sir Launcelot, arou&s;ed
by this circum&s;tance, a&s;&s;i&s;ted Dolly in
&s;eating her mi&s;tre&s;s on a couch, where
&s;he &s;oon recovered, and &s;aw the
knight on his knees before her. &startq;I
<PB N="49" REF="52">
am &s;till happy (&s;aid he) in being able
to move your compa&s;&s;ion, though I
have been held unworthy of your
e&s;teem.&endq; &startq;Do me ju&s;tice, (&s;he re|plied:)
my be&s;t e&s;teem has been al|ways
in&s;eparably connected with the
character of Sir Launcelot Greaves&endq;&mdash;&startq;Is
it po&s;&s;ible? (cried our hero) then
&s;urely I have no rea&s;on to complain.
If I have moved your compa&s;&s;ion,
and po&s;&s;e&s;s your e&s;teem, I am but one
degree &s;hort of &s;upreme happine&s;s&mdash;
that, however, is a gigantic &s;tep.&mdash;
O Mi&s;s Darnel! when I remember
that dear, that melancholy mo|ment.&endq;
&mdash;So &s;aying, he gently
touched her hand, in order to pre&s;s
it to his lips, and perceived on her
finger the very individual ring which
he had pre&s;ented in her mother's pre|&s;ence,
as an interchanged te&s;timony
of plighted faith. Starting at the
well known object, the &s;ight of which
conjured up a &s;trange confu&s;ion of
ideas, &startq;This (&s;aid he) was once the
pledge of &s;omething &s;till more cordial
than e&s;teem.&endq; Aurelia, blu&s;hing at
<PB N="50" REF="53">
this remark, while her eyes lightened
with unu&s;ual vivacity, replied, in a
&s;everer tone, &startq;Sir, you be&s;t know how
it lo&s;t its original &s;ignification.&endq; &startq;By
heaven! I do not, madam, (exclaim|ed
our adventurer.) With me it was
ever held a &s;acred idea throned within
my heart, cheri&s;hed with &s;uch fer|vency
of regard, with &s;uch reverence
of affection, as the devout anchorite
more unrea&s;onably pays to tho&s;e &s;aint|ed
reliques that con&s;titute the object of
his adoration&mdash;&endq; &startq;And, like tho&s;e
reliques, (an&s;wered Mi&s;s Darnel) I
have been in&s;en&s;ible of my votary's
devotion.&mdash;A &s;aint I mu&s;t have been,
or &s;omething more, to know the
&s;entiments of your heart by in&s;pi|ration.&endq;
&startq;Did I forbear (&s;aid he)
to expre&s;s, to repeat, to enforce the
dictates of the pure&s;t pa&s;&s;ion that
ever warmed the human brea&s;t, un|til
I was denied acce&s;s, and formally
di&s;carded by that cruel di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.&endq;&mdash;&startq;I
mu&s;t beg your pardon, Sir, (cried
Aurelia, interrupting him ha&s;tily) I
know not what you mean.&endq; &startq;That
<PB N="51" REF="54">
fatal &s;entence, (&s;aid he) if not pro|nounced
by your own lips, at lea&s;t
written by your own fair hand, which
drove me out an exile for ever from
the paradi&s;e of your affection.&endq; &startq;I
would not (&s;he replied) do Sir Laun|celot
Greaves the injury to &s;uppo&s;e
him capable of impo&s;ition: but you
talk of things to which I am an utter
&s;tranger.&mdash;I have a right, Sir, to de|mand
of your honour, that you will
not impute to me your breaking off a
connection, which&mdash;I would&mdash;rather
wi&s;h&mdash;had never.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Heaven and
earth! what do I hear? (cried our
impatient knight) have I not the bale|ful
letter to produce? What el&s;e but
Mi&s;s Darnel's explicit and expre&s;s de|claration
could have de&s;troyed the
&s;weete&s;t hope that ever cheared my
&s;oul; could have obliged me to re|&s;ign
all claim to that felicity for which
alone I wi&s;hed to live; could have
filled my bo&s;om with unutterable &s;or|row
and de&s;pair; could have even
dive&s;ted me of rea&s;on, and driven
me from the &s;ociety of men, a poor,
<PB N="52" REF="55">
forlorn, wandering lunatic, &s;uch as
you &s;ee me now pro&s;trate at your feet;
all the blo&s;&s;oms of my youth wither|ed,
all the honours of my family de|cayed?&endq;</P>
<P>Aurelia looking wi&s;tfully at her lo|ver,
&startq;Sir, (&s;aid &s;he) you overwhelm
me with amazement and anxiety! you
are impo&s;ed upon, if you have re|ceived
any &s;uch letter: you are de|ceived,
if you thought Aurelia Dar|nel
could be &s;o in&s;en&s;ible, ungrateful,
and&mdash;incon&s;tant.&endq;</P>
<P>This la&s;t word &s;he pronounced with
&s;ome he&s;itation, and a downca&s;t look,
while her face underwent a total &s;uf|fu&s;ion,
and the knight's heart began
to palpitate with all the violence of
emotion. He eagerly imprinted a
ki&s;s upon her hand, exclaiming, in
interrupted phra&s;e, &startq;Can it be po&s;&s;i|ble?&mdash;Heaven
grant&mdash;Sure this is no
illu&s;ion.&mdash;O, madam!&mdash;&s;hall I call
you my Aurelia? My heart is bur&s;t|ing
with a thou&s;and fond thoughts
and pre&s;ages. You &s;hall &s;ee that dire
paper which hath been the &s;ource of
<PB N="53" REF="56">
all my woes&mdash;it is the con&s;tant com|panion
of my travels.&mdash;La&s;t night I
nouri&s;hed my chagrin with the peru|&s;al
of its horrid contents.&endq;</P>
<P>Aurelia expre&s;&s;ed great impatience
to view the cruel forgery; for &s;uch &s;he
a&s;&s;ured him it mu&s;t be: but he could
not gratify her de&s;ire till the arrival of
his &s;ervant with the portmanteau.
In the mean time, tea was called.
The lovers were &s;eated: he looked
and langui&s;hed; &s;he flu&s;hed and faul|tered:
all was doubt and delirium,
fondne&s;s and flutter. Their mutual
di&s;order communicated it&s;elf to the
kind-hearted &s;ympathizing Dolly, who
had been witne&s;s to the interview, and
deeply affected with the di&s;clo&s;ure of
the &s;cene. Un&s;peakable was her &s;ur|prize
when &s;he found her mi&s;tre&s;s
Mi&s;s Meadows was no other than
the celebrated Aurelia Darnel, who&s;e
elogium &s;he had heard &s;o eloquently
pronounced by her &s;weet-heart Mr.
Thomas Clarke; a di&s;covery which
&s;till more endeared her lady to her
affection. She had wept plentifully
<PB N="54" REF="57">
at the progre&s;s of their mutual expla|nation;
and was now &s;o di&s;concerted,
that &s;he &s;carce knew the meaning of
the orders &s;he had received. She &s;et
the kettle on the table, and placed
the tea-board on the fire. Her con|fu&s;ion,
by attracting the notice of
her mi&s;tre&s;s, helped to relieve her
from her own embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ituation.
She, with her own delicate hands,
rectified the mi&s;take of Dolly; who
&s;till continued to &s;ob, and &s;aid, &startq;Yaw
may think, my leady Darnel, as haw
I 'aive yeaten hool-chee&s;e; but it
y'an't &s;oa.&mdash;I'&s;e think, vor maai peart,
as how I'aive bean bewitched.&endq; Sir
Launcelot could not help &s;miling at
the &s;implicity of Dolly, who&s;e goodne&s;s
of heart and attachment, Aurelia
did not fail to extol, as &s;oon as her
back was turned. It was in con&s;e|quence
of this commendation, that,
the next time &s;he entered the room,
our adventurer, for the fir&s;t time,
con&s;idered her face, and &s;eemed to
be &s;truck with her features. He
a&s;ked her &s;ome que&s;tions, which &s;he
<PB N="55" REF="58">
could not an&s;wer to his &s;atisfaction,
applauded her regard for her lady,
and a&s;&s;ured her of his friend&s;hip and
protection. He now begged to know
the cau&s;e that obliged his Aurelia to
travel at &s;uch a rate, and in &s;uch an
equipage; and &s;he informed him of
tho&s;e particulars which we have al|ready
communicated to the reader.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot glowed with re&s;ent|ment,
when he under&s;tood how his
dear Aurelia had been oppre&s;&s;ed by
her perfidious and cruel guardian. He
bit his nether lip, rolled his eyes
around, &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and
&s;triding acro&s;s the room, &startq;I remem|ber
(&s;aid he) the dying words of her
who is now a &s;aint in heaven&mdash;&startq;That
violent man, my brother-in-law,
who is Aurelia's &s;ole guardian,
will thwart her wi&s;hes with every ob|&s;tacle
that brutal re&s;entment and im|placable
malice can contrive.&endq;&mdash;What
followed, it would ill become me to
repeat: but &s;he concluded with the&s;e
words&mdash;&startq;The re&s;t we mu&s;t leave to
the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence.&endq;&mdash;
<PB N="56" REF="59">
Was it not Providence that &s;ent me
hither, to guard and protect the in|jured
Aurelia?&endq; Then turning to
Mi&s;s Darnel, who&s;e eyes &s;treamed
with tears, he added, &startq;Yes, divine
creature! heaven, careful of your
&s;afety, and in compa&s;&s;ion to my &s;uf|ferings,
hath guided me hither, in
this my&s;terious manner, that I might
defend you from violence, and enjoy
this tran&s;ition from madne&s;s to delibe|ration,
from de&s;pair to felicity.&endq; So
&s;aying, he approached this amiable
mourner, this fragrant flower of beau|ty,
glittering with the dew-drops of
the morning; this &s;weete&s;t, and gent|le&s;t,
lovelie&s;t ornament of human
nature: he gazed upon her with
looks of love ineffable: he &s;at down
by her; he pre&s;&s;ed her &s;oft hand in
his; he began to fear that all he &s;aw
was the flattering vi&s;ion of a di&s;tem|pered
brain. He looked and &s;ighed;
and turning up his eyes to heaven,
breathed, in broken murmurs, the
cha&s;te raptures of his &s;oul. The ten|derne&s;s
of this communication was
<PB N="57" REF="60">
too painful to be long endured. Au|relia
indu&s;triou&s;ly interpo&s;ed other
&s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e, that his atten|tion
might not be dangerou&s;ly over|charged,
and the afternoon pa&s;&s;ed in|&s;en&s;ibly
away.</P>
<P>Though he had determined, in his
own mind, never more to quit this
idol of his &s;oul, they had not yet con|certed
any plan of conduct, when
their happine&s;s was all at once inter|rupted
by a repetition of cries, de|noting
horror; and a &s;ervant, coming
in, &s;aid he believed &s;ome rogues were
murdering a traveller on the highway.
The &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s ope|rated
like gunpowder on the di&s;po&s;ition
of our adventurer, who, without con|&s;idering
the &s;ituation of Aurelia, and
indeed without &s;eeing, or being capa|ble
to think on her, or any other &s;ub|ject,
for the time being, ran directly
to the &s;table, and mounting the fir&s;t
hor&s;e which he found &s;addled, i&s;&s;ued
out in the twilight, having no other
weapon but his &s;word. He rode full
&s;peed to the &s;pot whence the cries
<PB N="58" REF="61">
&s;eemed to proceed; but they &s;ounded
more remote as he advanced. Ne|verthele&s;s
he followed them to a con|&s;iderable
di&s;tance from the road, over
fields, ditches, and hedges; and at
la&s;t came &s;o near, that he could plain|ly
di&s;tingui&s;h the voice of his own
&s;quire, Timothy Crab&s;haw, bellow|ing
for mercy, with hideous vocife|ration.
Stimulated by this recogni|tion,
he redoubled his career in the
dark, till at length his hor&s;e plunged
into a hole, the nature of which he
could not comprehend; but he found
it impracticable to di&s;engage him.
It was with &s;ome difficulty that he
him&s;elf clambered over a ruined wall,
and regained the open ground. Here
he groped about, in the utmo&s;t im|patience
of anxiety, ignorant of the
place, mad with vexation for the fate
of his unfortunate &s;quire, and be|tween
whiles invaded with a pang of
concern for Aurelia, left among &s;tran|gers,
unguarded, and alarmed. In
the mid&s;t of this emotion, he be|thought
him&s;elf of hollowing aloud,
<PB N="59" REF="62">
that, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be in the neigh|bourhood
of any inhabited place, he
might be heard and a&s;&s;i&s;ted. He ac|cordingly
practi&s;ed this expedient,
which was not altogether without ef|fect;
for he was immediately an&s;wer|ed
by an old friend, no other than
his own &s;teed Bronzomarte, who,
hearing his ma&s;ter's voice, neighed
&s;trenuou&s;ly at a &s;mall di&s;tance. The
knight, being well acquainted with
the &s;ound, heard with a&s;toni&s;hment;
and, advancing in the right direction,
found his noble charger fa&s;tened to a
tree. He forthwith untied and mount|ed
him; then, laying the reins upon
his neck, allowed him to chu&s;e his
own path, in which he began to tra|vel
with equal &s;teadine&s;s and expe|dition.
They had not proceeded far
when the knight's ears were again &s;a|luted
by the cries of Crab&s;haw; which
Bronzomarte no &s;ooner heard than he
pricked up his ears, neighed, and
quickened his pace, as if he had been
&s;en&s;ible of the &s;quire's di&s;tre&s;s, and
ha&s;tened to his relief. Sir Launcelot,
<PB N="60" REF="63">
notwith&s;tanding his own di&s;quiet,
could not help ob&s;erving and admiring
this generous &s;en&s;ibility of his hor&s;e:
he began to think him&s;elf &s;ome hero
of romance mounted upon a winged
&s;teed, in&s;pired with rea&s;on, directed
by &s;ome humane inchanter, who pitied
virtue in di&s;tre&s;s. All circum&s;tances
con&s;idered, it is no wonder that the
commotion in the mind of our ad|venturer
produced &s;ome &s;uch deli|rium.
All night he continued the
chace; the voice, which was repeat|ed
at intervals, &s;till retreating before
him, till the morning began to ap|pear
in the Ea&s;t, when, by divers
piteous groans, he was directed to
the corner of a wood, where he be|held
his mi&s;erable &s;quire &s;tretched up|on
the gra&s;s, and Gilbert feeding by
him altogether unconcerned, the hel|met
and the launce &s;u&s;pended at the
&s;addle-bow, and the portmanteau
&s;afely fixed upon the crupper.</P>
<P>The knight, riding up to Crab&s;haw,
with equal &s;urprize and concern, a&s;k|ed
what had brought him there; and
<PB N="61" REF="64">
Timothy, after &s;ome pau&s;e, during
which he &s;urveyed his ma&s;ter with a
rueful a&s;pect, an&s;wered, &startq;The de|vil.&endq;
&startq;One would imagine, indeed,
you had &s;ome &s;uch conveyance, (&s;aid
Sir Launcelot.) I have followed your
cries &s;ince la&s;t evening I know not
how, nor whither, and never could
come up with you till this moment.
But, &s;ay, what damage have you
&s;u&s;tained, that you lie in that wretch|ed
po&s;ture, and groan &s;o di&s;mally?&endq;
&startq;I can't gue&s;s, (replied the &s;quire)
if it bean't that mai hoole carca&s;e is
drilled into oilet hools, and my fle&s;h
pinched into a jelly.&endq;&mdash;&startq;How!
wherefore? (cried the knight)&mdash;who
were the mi&s;creants that treated you
in &s;uch a barbarous manner? Do you
know the ruffians?&endq; &startq;I know no|thing
at all, (an&s;wered the peevi&s;h
&s;quire) but that I was tormented by
vive houndred and vifty thou&s;and le|gions
of devils, and there's an end
oon't.&endq; &startq;Well, you mu&s;t have a
little patience, Crab&s;haw&mdash;there's a
&s;alve for every &s;ore.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Yaw mought
<PB N="62" REF="65">
as well tell ma, for every zow there's
a zirreverence.&endq; &startq;For a man in
your condition, methinks you talk
very much at your ea&s;e&mdash;Try if you
can get up and mount Gilbert, that
you may be conveyed to &s;ome place
where you can have proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
&mdash;So&mdash;well done&mdash;chearly.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Timothy actually made an effort
to ri&s;e; but fell down again, and ut|tered
a di&s;mal yell. Then his ma&s;ter
exhorted him to take advantage of a
park-wall by which he lay, and rai&s;e
him&s;elf gradually upon it. Crab|&s;haw,
eying him a&s;kance, &s;aid, by
way of reproach, for his not alight|ing
and a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in per&s;on,
&startq;Thatch your hou&s;e with t&mdash;d,
and you'll have more teachers than
reachers.&endq;&mdash;Having pronounced this
inelegant adage, he made &s;hift to &s;tand
upon his legs; and now, the knight
lending a hand, was mounted upon
Gilbert, though not without a world
of oh's! and ah's! and other ajacu|lations
of pain and impatience. As
they jogged on together, our adven|turer
<PB N="63" REF="66">
endeavoured to learn the parti|culars
of the di&s;a&s;ter which had be|fallen
the &s;quire; but all the in|formation
he could obtain amounted
to a very imperfect &s;ketch of the ad|venture.
By dint of a thou&s;and in|terrogations
he under&s;tood, that Crab|&s;haw
had been, in the preceding
evening, encountered by three per|&s;ons
on hor&s;eback with Venetian
ma&s;ques on their faces, which he
mi&s;took for their natural features, and
was terrified accordingly: that they
not only pre&s;ented pi&s;tols to his brea&s;t,
and led his hor&s;e out of the highway;
but pricked him with goads, and
pinched him, from time to time, till
he &s;creamed with the torture: that he
was led through unfrequented places
acro&s;s the country, &s;ometimes at an
ea&s;y trot, &s;ometimes at full gallop,
and tormented all night by tho&s;e hi|deous
daemons, who vani&s;hed at day-break,
and left him lying on the &s;pot
where he was found by his ma&s;ter.
This was a my&s;tery which our hero
could by no means unriddle: it was
<PB N="64" REF="67">
the more unaccountable, as the &s;quire
had not been robbed of his money,
hor&s;es, and baggage. He was even
di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that Crab&s;haw's
brain was di&s;ordered, and the whole
account he had given, no more than
a chimera. This opinion, however,
he could no longer retain, when he
arrived at an inn on the po&s;t-road,
and found, upon examination, that
Timothy's lower extremities were co|vered
with blood, and all the re&s;t of
his body &s;peckled with livid marks of
contu&s;ion. But he was &s;till more cha|grined
when the landlord informed
him, that he was thirty miles di&s;tant
from the place where he had left Au|relia,
and that his way lay through
cro&s;s-roads, which were almo&s;t im|pa&s;&s;able
at that &s;ea&s;on of the year.
Alarmed at this intelligence, he gave
directions that his &s;quire &s;hould be
immediately conveyed to bed in a
comfortable chamber, as he complain|ed
more and more; and indeed was
&s;eized with a fever, occa&s;ioned by the
fatigue, the pain, and terror he had
<PB N="65" REF="68">
undergone. A neighbouring apo|thecary
being called, and giving it
as his opinion that he could not for
&s;ome days be in a condition to travel,
his ma&s;ter depo&s;ited a &s;um of money
in his hands, de&s;iring he might be
properly attended, till he &s;hould hear
further. Then mounting Bronzo|marte,
he &s;et out with a guide for the
place he had left, not without a thou|&s;and
fears and perplexities, ari&s;ing
from the reflection of having left the
jewel of his heart with &s;uch precipi|tation.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which, it is to be hoped, the reader

and madne&s;s, &s;en&s;e and ab&s;urdity.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not without rea&s;on that our
adventurer afflicted him&s;elf: his
fears were but too prophetic. When
he alighted at the inn, which he had
left &s;o abruptly the preceding evening,
he ran directly to the apartment where
he had been &s;o happy in Aurelia's com|pany;
<PB N="66" REF="69">
but her he &s;aw not&mdash;all was
&s;olitary. Turning to the woman of
the hou&s;e, who had followed him into
the room, &startq;Where is the lady?&endq;
cried he, in a tone of impatience.
Mine ho&s;te&s;s, &s;crewing up her features
into a very demure a&s;pect, &s;aid &s;he &s;aw
&s;o many ladies, &s;he could not pretend
to know who he meant. &startq;I tell thee,
woman, (exclaimed the knight, in a
louder accent) thou never &s;awe&s;t &s;uch
another&mdash;I mean that miracle of beau|ty&mdash;&endq;
&startq;Very like, (replied the dame,
as &s;he retired to the room-door.) Hu&s;|band,
here's one as axes concerning a
miracle of beauty; hi, hi, hi. Can
you give him any information about
this miracle of beauty?&mdash;Ola! hi, hi,
hi.&endq; In&s;tead of an&s;wering this que&s;|tion,
the inn-keeper advancing, and
&s;urveying Sir Launcelot, &startq;Friend,
(&s;aid he) you are the per&s;on that car|ried
off my hor&s;e out of the &s;table.&endq;
&startq;Tell me not of a hor&s;e&mdash;where is
the young lady?&endq; &startq;Now I will tell
you of the hor&s;e, and I'll make you
find him too, before you and I part.&endq;
<PB N="67" REF="70">
&startq;Wretched animal! how dar'&s;t thou
dally with my impatience?&mdash;Speak,
or de&s;pair.&mdash;What is become of Mi&s;s
Meadows? Say, did &s;he leave this
place of her own accord, or was &s;he&mdash;
hah!&mdash;&s;peak&mdash;an&s;wer, or, by the
Powers above&mdash;&endq; &startq;I'll an&s;wer you

your&s;elf ea&s;y on that &s;core&mdash;&endq; &startq;Sa|cred
Heaven! explain your meaning,
mi&s;creant, or I'll make you a dreadful
example to all the in&s;olent publicans of
the realm.&endq; So &s;aying, he &s;eized him
with one hand, and da&s;hing him on
the floor, &s;et one foot on his belly, and
kept him trembling in that pro&s;trate
attitude. The ho&s;tler and waiter fly|ing
to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their ma&s;ter,
our adventurer un&s;heathed his &s;word,
declaring he would di&s;mi&s;s their &s;ouls
from their bodies, and exterminate the
whole family from the face of the
earth, if they would not immediately
give him the &s;atisfaction he required.</P>
<P>The ho&s;te&s;s, being by this time ter|rified
almo&s;t out of her &s;en&s;es, fell on
<PB N="68" REF="71">
her knees before him, begging he
would &s;pare their lives, and promi&s;ing
to declare the whole truth. He would
not, however, remove his foot from
the body of her hu&s;band, until &s;he told
him, that, in le&s;s than half an hour af|ter
he had &s;allied out upon the &s;up|po&s;ed
robbers, two chai&s;es arrived,
each drawn by four hor&s;es: that two
men, armed with pi&s;tols, alighting
from one of them, laid violent hands
upon the young lady; and, notwith|&s;tanding
her &s;truggling and &s;hrieking,
forced her into the other carriage, in
which was an infirm gentleman, who
called him&s;elf her guardian: that the
maid was left to the care of a third
&s;ervant, to follow with a third chai&s;e,
which was got ready with all po&s;&s;ible
di&s;patch, while the other two pro|ceeded
at full &s;peed on the road to
London. It was by this communica|tive
lacquey the people of the hou&s;e
were informed, that the old gentle|man
his ma&s;ter was &s;quire Darnel, the
young lady his niece and ward, and
our adventurer a needy &s;harper, who
<PB N="69" REF="72">
wanted to make prey of her fortune.
The knight, fired even almo&s;t to
frenzy by this intimation, &s;purned the
carca&s;e of his ho&s;t; and, his eye
gleaming terror, ru&s;hed into the yard,
in order to mount Bronzomarte, and
pur&s;ue the ravi&s;her, when he was di|verted
from his purpo&s;e by a new in|cident.</P>
<P>One of the po&s;tilions, who had dri|ven
the chai&s;e in which Dolly was
conveyed, happened to arrive at that
in&s;tant; when, &s;eeing our hero, he
ran up to him cap in hand, and, pre|&s;enting
a letter, acco&s;ted him in the&s;e
words: &startq;Plea&s;e your noble honour,

Greaves of the We&s;t Riding, here's a
letter from a gentlewoman, that I pro|mi&s;ed
to deliver into your honour's

<P>The knight, &s;natching the letter
with the utmo&s;t avidity, broke it up,
and found the contents couched in
the&s;e terms:</P>
<LETTER>

Nothing could be more &s;ea&s;onable
than the delivery of this billet; which
he had no &s;ooner peru&s;ed, than his
reflection returned, and he entered
into a &s;erious deliberation with his own
heart. He con&s;idered that Aurelia
was by this time far beyond a po&s;&s;i|bility
of being overtaken; and that
by a precipitate pur&s;uit he &s;hould only
expo&s;e his own infirmities. He con|fided
in the attachment of his mi&s;tre&s;s,
and in the fidelity of her maid, who
would find opportunities of com|municating
her &s;entiments, by the
means of this lacquey, of whom he
perceived by the letter &s;he had alrea|dy
made a conque&s;t. He therefore
re&s;olved to bridle his impatience, to
proceed lei&s;urely to London, and, in|&s;tead
of taking any ra&s;h &s;tep which
might induce Anthony Darnel to re|move
his niece from that city, remain
in &s;eeming quiet until &s;he &s;hould be
&s;ettled, and her guardian returned to
the country. Aurelia had mention|ed
to him the name of doctor Kawdle,
and from him he expected, in due
<PB N="72" REF="75">
time, to receive the mo&s;t intere&s;ting
information.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections had an in&s;tan|taneous
effect upon our hero, who&s;e
rage immediately &s;ub&s;ided, and who&s;e
vi&s;age gradually re&s;umed its natural
ca&s;t of courte&s;y and good humour.
He forthwith gratified the po&s;tilion
with &s;uch a remuneration as &s;ent him
dancing into the kitchen, where he
did not fail to extol the genero&s;ity and
immen&s;e fortune of Sir Launcelot
Greaves.</P>
<P>Our adventurer's next &s;tep was to
&s;ee Bronzomarte properly accommo|dated;
then he ordered a refre&s;hment
for him&s;elf, and retired into an apart|ment,
where mine ho&s;t with his wife
and all the &s;ervants waited on him, to
be&s;eech his honour to forgive their im|pertinence,
which was owing to their
ignorance of his honour's quality, and
the fal&s;e information they had received
from the gentleman's &s;ervant. He
had too much magnanimity to retain
the lea&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t &s;uch in|con&s;iderable
objects. He not only par|doned
<PB N="73" REF="76">
them without he&s;itation; but
a&s;&s;ured the landlord he would be ac|countable
for the hor&s;e, which, how|ever,
was that &s;ame evening brought
home by a countryman, who had
found him pounded as it were within
the walls of a ruined cottage. As
the knight had been greatly fatigued,
without enjoying any re&s;t for eight
and forty hours, he re&s;olved to indulge
him&s;elf with one night's repo&s;e, and
then return to the place where he had
left his &s;quire indi&s;po&s;ed: for by this
time even his concern for Timothy
had recurred.</P>
<P>On a candid &s;crutiny of his own
heart, he found him&s;elf much le&s;s
unhappy than he had been before his
interview with Aurelia; for, in&s;tead
of being as formerly tormented with
the pangs of de&s;pairing love, which
had actually un&s;ettled his under&s;tand|ing,
he was now happily convinced
that he had in&s;pired the tender brea&s;t
of Aurelia with mutual affection;
and though &s;he was invidiou&s;ly
&s;natched from his embrace, in the
<PB N="74" REF="77">
mid&s;t of &s;nch endearments as had
wound up his &s;oul to exta&s;y and tran&s;|port,
he did not doubt of being able
to re&s;cue her from the power of an
inhuman kin&s;man, who&s;e guardian|&s;hip
would &s;oon of cour&s;e expire;
and in the mean time, he re&s;ted with
the mo&s;t perfect dependence on her
con&s;tancy and virtue.</P>
<P>As he next day cro&s;&s;ed the coun|try,
ruminating on the di&s;a&s;ter that
had befallen his &s;quire, and could
now compare circum&s;tances coolly,
he ea&s;ily comprehended the whole
&s;cheme of that adventure, which was
no other than an artifice of Anthony
Darnel and his emi&s;&s;aries, to draw
him from the inn where he propo&s;ed
to execute his de&s;ign upon the inno|cent
Aurelia. He took it for granted,
that the uncle, having been made
acquainted with his niece's elopement,
had followed her track by the help of
&s;uch information as he received from
one &s;tage to another; and that, receiv|ing
more particulars at the White Hart
touching Sir Launcelot, he had form|ed
<PB N="75" REF="78">
the &s;cheme in which Crab&s;haw
was an involuntary in&s;trument to|wards
the &s;eduction of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Amu&s;ing him&s;elf with the&s;e and
other cogitations, our hero in the af|ternoon
reached the place of his de|&s;tination;
and entering the inn where
Timothy had been left at &s;ick quar|ters,
chanced to meet the apothecary
retiring precipitately in a very un&s;a|voury
pickle from the chamber of his
patient. When he enquired about
the health of his &s;quire, this retainer
to medicine, wiping him&s;elf all the
while with a napkin, an&s;wered in ma|nife&s;t
confu&s;ion, That he apprehend|ed
him to be in a very dangerous way,
from an inflammation of the <HI>pia mater,</HI>
which had produced a mo&s;t furious
delirium. Then he proceeded to ex|plain,
in technical terms, the method
of cure he had followed; and con|cluded
with telling him the poor
&s;quire's brain was &s;o outrageou&s;ly di&s;|ordered,
that he had rejected all ad|mini&s;tration,
and ju&s;t thrown an uri|nal
in his face.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79">
The knight's humanity being a|larmed
at this intelligence, he re|&s;olved
that Crab&s;haw &s;hould have the
benefit of further advice, and a&s;ked
if there was not a phy&s;ician in the
place. The apothecary, after &s;ome
interjections of he&s;itation, owned
there was a doctor in the village, an
odd &s;ort of a humouri&s;t; but he be|lieved
he had not much to do in the
way of his profe&s;&s;ion, and was not
much u&s;ed to the forms of pre&s;crip|tion.
He was counted a &s;cholar, to
be &s;ure; but as to his medical capa|city,&mdash;he
would not take upon
him to &s;ay&mdash;&startq;No matter, (cried
Sir Launcelot) he may &s;trike out
&s;ome lucky thought for the benefit of
the patient; and I de&s;ire you will call
him in&s;tantly.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>While the apothecary was ab&s;ent
on this &s;ervice, our adventurer took
it in his head to que&s;tion the landlord
about the character of this phy&s;ician,
which had been &s;o unfavourably re|pre&s;ented,
and received the following
information:</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="80">
&startq;For my peart, mea&s;ter, I knows
nothing ami&s;s of the doctor&mdash;he's
a quiet &s;ort of an inoffen&s;ive man;
u&s;es my hou&s;e &s;ometimes, and pays
for what he has, like the re&s;t of my
cu&s;tomers. They &s;ays he deals very
little in phy&s;ic &s;tuff, but cures his pa|tients
with fa&s;ting and water-gruel,
whereby he can't expect the pothe|cary
to be his friend. You knows,
ma&s;ter, one mu&s;t live, and let live,
as the &s;aying is. I mu&s;t &s;ay, he, for
for the value of three guineas, &s;et
up my wife's con&s;titution in &s;uch a
manner, that I have &s;aved within
the&s;e two years, I believe, forty pounds
in pothecary's bills. But what of
that? Every man mu&s;t eat, tho'f at
another's expence; and I &s;hould be in
a deadly hole my&s;elf, if all my cu&s;to|mers
&s;hould take it in their heads to
drink nothing but water-gruel, be|cau&s;e
it is good for the con&s;titution.
Thank God, I have as good a con&s;ti|tution
as e'er a man in England; but
for all that, I and my whole family
bleed and purge and take a diet$drink
<PB N="78" REF="81">
twice a-year, by way of &s;erving the
pothecary, who is a very hone&s;t man,
and a very good neighbour.&endq;</P>
<P>Their conver&s;ation was interrupted
by the return of the apothecary with
the doctor, who had very little of the
faculty in his appearance. He was
dre&s;&s;ed remarkably plain; &s;eemed to
be turned of fifty; had a carele&s;s air,
and a &s;arca&s;tical turn in his counte|nance.
Before he entered the &s;ick
man's chamber, he a&s;ked &s;ome que|&s;tions
concerning the di&s;ea&s;e; and
when the apothecary, pointing to his
own head, &s;aid, &startq;It lies all here;&endq;
the doctor, turning to Sir Launcelot,
replied, &startq;If that be all, there's no|thing
in it.&endq;</P>
<P>Upon a more particular enquiry
about the &s;ymptoms, he was told that
the blood was &s;eemingly vi&s;cous, and
&s;alt upon the tongue; the urine re|markably
acro&s;aline; and the faeces
atrabilious and foetid. When the
doctor &s;aid he would engage to find
the &s;ame phaenomena in every healthy
man of the three kingdoms; the apo|thecary
<PB N="79" REF="82">
added, that the patient was
manife&s;tly comatous, and moreover
afflicted with griping pains and bor|borygmata.&mdash;&startq;A
f&mdash;t for your bor|borygmata,
(cried the phy&s;ician.)
What has been done?&endq; To this que|&s;tion
he replied, that venae&s;ection had
been three times performed: that a
ve&s;icatory had been applied <HI>inter &s;ca|pulas:</HI>
that the patient had taken oc|ca&s;ionally
of a cathartic apozem, and,
between whiles, alexipharmic bolu&s;es
and neutral draughts.&mdash;&startq;Neutral,
indeed, (&s;aid the doctor;) &s;o neutral,
that I'll be crucified if ever they de|clare
either for the patient or the di&s;|ea&s;e.&endq;
So &s;aying, he bru&s;hed into
Crab&s;haw's chamber, followed by
our adventurer, who was almo&s;t &s;uf|focated
at his fir&s;t entrance. The
day was clo&s;e, the window-&s;hutters
were fa&s;tened; a huge fire blazed in
the chimney; thick harateen curtains
were clo&s;e drawn round the bed,
where the wretched &s;quire lay extend|ed
under an enormous load of blan|kets.
The nur&s;e, who had all the
<PB N="80" REF="83">
exteriors of a bawd given to drink,
&s;at &s;tewing in this apartment, like a
damned &s;oul in &s;ome infernal bagnio:
but ri&s;ing, when the company enter|ed,
made her curt&s;ies with great de|corum.
&startq;Well, (&s;aid the doctor)
how does your patient, nur&s;e?&endq;
&startq;Ble&s;&s;ed be God for it, I hope in a
fair way:&mdash;to be &s;ure his apozem
has had a ble&s;&s;ed effect&mdash;five and
twenty &s;tools &s;ince three o'clock in
the morning.&mdash;But then a'would
not &s;uffer the bli&s;ters to be put upon
his thighs.&mdash;Good lack! a'has been
mortally ob&s;tropolous, and out of his
&s;en&s;es all this ble&s;&s;ed day.&endq;&mdash;&startq;You
lie, (cried the &s;quire) I a'n't out of
my &s;even &s;en&s;es, thof I'm half mad
with vexation.&endq;</P>
<P>The doctor having withdrawn the
curtain, the haple&s;s &s;quire appeared
very pale and gha&s;tly; and having
&s;urveyed his ma&s;ter with a rueful
a&s;pect, addre&s;&s;ed him in the&s;e words:
&startq;Sir knight, I beg a boon: be plea&s;|ed
to tie a &s;tone about the neck of
the apothecary, and a halter about the
<PB N="81" REF="84">
neck of the nur&s;e, and throw the one
into the next river, and the other
over the next tree, and in &s;o doing
you will do a charitable deed to your
fellow-creatures; for he and &s;he do
the devil's work in partner&s;hip, and
have &s;ent many &s;core of their betters
home to him before their time.&endq;
&startq;Oh, he begins to talk &s;en&s;ibly.&endq;
&startq;Have a good heart, (&s;aid the phy|&s;ician.)
What is your di&s;order?&endq;
&startq;Phy&s;ick. &startq;What do you chiefly
complain of?&endq; &startq;The doctor.&endq;
&startq;Does your head ake?&endq; &startq;Yea,
with impertinence.&endq; &startq;Have you
a pain in your back?&endq; &startq;Yes, where
the bli&s;ter lies.&endq; &startq;Are you &s;ick at
&s;tomach?&endq; &startq;Yes, with hunger.&endq;
&startq;Do you feel any &s;hiverings?&endq;
&startq;Always at &s;ight of the apothecary.&endq;
&startq;Do you perceive any load in your
bowels?&endq; &startq;I would the apothe|cary's
con&s;cience was as clear.&endq; &startq;Are
you thir&s;ty?&endq; &startq;Not thir&s;ty enough
to drink barley-water.&endq; &startq;Be plea&s;ed
to look into his fauces, (&s;aid the apo|thecary:)
he has got a rough tongue,
<PB N="82" REF="85">
and a very foul mouth, I'll a&s;&s;ure you.&endq;
&startq;I have known that the ca&s;e with
&s;ome limbs of the faculty, where
they &s;tood more in need of correction
than of phy&s;ick.&mdash;Well, my hone&s;t
friend, &s;ince you have already un|dergone
the proper purgations in due
form, and &s;ay you have no other
di&s;ea&s;e than the doctor, we will &s;et
you on your legs again, without fur|ther
que&s;tion. Here, nur&s;e, open
that window, and throw the&s;e vials
into the &s;treet. Now lower the cur|tain,
without &s;hutting the ca&s;ement,
that the man may not be &s;tifled in his
own &s;team. In the next place, take
off two thirds of the&s;e coals, and one
third of the&s;e blankets.&mdash;How do'&s;t
feel now, my heart?&endq; &startq;I &s;hould
feel heart-whole, if &s;o be as yow
would throw the noor&s;e a'ter the bot|tles,
and the pothecary a'ter the noor&s;e,
and oorder me a pound of chops for
my dinner; for I be &s;o hoongry, I
could eat a hor&s;e behind the &s;addle.&endq;</P>
<P>The apothecary, &s;eeing what pa&s;|&s;ed,
retired of his own accord, hold|ing
<PB N="83" REF="86">
up his hands in &s;ign of a&s;toni&s;h|ment.
The nur&s;e was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in
the &s;ame breath. Crab&s;haw ro&s;e,
dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
made a hearty meal on the fir&s;t eatable
that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his view. The
knight pa&s;&s;ed the evening with the
phy&s;ician, who, from his fir&s;t appear|ance,
concluded he was mad; but, in
the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation, found
means to re&s;ign that opinion, without
adopting any other in lieu of it, and
parted with him under all the impa|tience
of curio&s;ity. The knight, on
his part, was very well entertained
with the witty &s;arca&s;ms and erudition
of the doctor, who appeared to be a
&s;ort of cynic philo&s;opher, tinctured
with mi&s;anthropy, and at open war
with the whole body of apothecaries,
whom, however, it was by no means
his intere&s;t to di&s;oblige.</P>
<P>Next day, Crab&s;haw being to all
appearance perfectly recovered, our
adventurer reckoned with the apothe|cary,
payed the landlord, and &s;et out
on his return for the London road,
<PB N="84" REF="87">
re&s;olving to lay a&s;ide his armour at
&s;ome di&s;tance from the metropolis:
for, ever &s;ince his interview with Au|relia,
his fondne&s;s for chivalry had
been gradually abating. As the tor|rent
of his de&s;pair had di&s;ordered the
current of his &s;ober reflection, &s;o now,
as that de&s;pair &s;ub&s;ided, his thoughts
began to flow deliberately in their an|cient
channel. All day long he re|galed
his imagination with plans of
connubial happine&s;s, formed on the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the incomparable Aure|lia;
determined to wait with patience,
until the law &s;hould &s;uper&s;ede the au|thority
of her guardian, rather than a|dopt
any violent expedient which might
hazard the intere&s;t of his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He had for &s;ome time travelled in
the turnpike road, when his reverie
was &s;uddenly interrupted by a con|fu&s;ed
noi&s;e; and when he lifted up
his eyes, he beheld at a little di&s;tance
a rabble of men and women, variou&s;|ly
armed with flails, pitch-forks, poles,
and mu&s;kets, acting offen&s;ively again&s;t
a &s;trange figure on hor&s;eback, who,
<PB N="85" REF="88">
with a kind of lance, laid about him
with incredible fury. Our adventurer
was not &s;o totally abandoned by the
&s;pirit of chivalry, as to &s;ee without
emotion a &s;ingle knight in danger of
being overpowered by &s;uch a multi|tude
of adver&s;aries. Without &s;taying
to put on his helmet, he ordered
Crab&s;haw to follow him in the charge
again&s;t tho&s;e plebeians: then couch|ing
his lance, and giving Bronzomarte
the &s;pur, he began his career with
&s;uch impetuo&s;ity as overturned all that
happened to be in his way; and inti|midated
the rabble to &s;uch a degree,
that they retired before him like a
flock of &s;heep, the greater part of
them believing he was the devil <HI>in
propria per&s;ona.</HI> He came in the very
nick of time to &s;ave the life of the
other errant, again&s;t whom three
loaded mu&s;kets were actually levelled,
at the very in&s;tant that our adventurer
began his charge. The unknown
knight was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ea&s;ona|ble
interpo&s;ition, that riding up to our
hero, &startq;Brother, (&s;aid he) this is the
<PB N="86" REF="89">
&s;econd time you have holp me off,
when I was bump a&s;hore.&mdash;Be&s;s
Mizen, I mu&s;t &s;ay, is no more than
a leaky bumboat, in compari&s;on of the
glorious galley you want to man. I
de&s;ire that henceforth we may crui&s;e
in the &s;ame latitudes, brother; and
I'll be damned if I don't &s;tand by you
as long as I have a &s;tick &s;tanding, or
can carry a rag of canvas.&endq;</P>
<P>By this addre&s;s our knight recogni|zed
the novice captain Crowe, who
had found means to accommodate
him&s;elf with a very &s;trange &s;uit of ar|mour.
By way of helmet, he wore
one of the caps u&s;ed by the light hor&s;e,
with &s;traps buckled under his chin,
and contrived in &s;uch a manner as to
conceal his whole vi&s;age, except the
eyes. In&s;tead of cuira&s;s, mail, greaves,
and the other pieces of complete ar|mour,
he was ca&s;ed in a po&s;tilion's
leathern jerkin, covered with thin
plates of tinned iron: his buckler was
a potlid, his lance a hop-pole &s;hod
with iron, and a ba&s;ket-hilt broad
&s;word, like that of Hudibras, depen|ded
<PB N="87" REF="90">
by a broad buff belt, that girded
his middle. His feet were defended
by jack-boots, and his hands by the
gloves of a trooper. Sir Launcelot
would not lo&s;e time in examining par|ticulars,
as he perceived &s;ome mi&s;chief
had been done, and that the enemy
had rallied at a di&s;tance: he therefore
commanded Crowe to follow him,
and rode off with great expedition;
but he did not perceive that his &s;quire
was taken pri&s;oner; nor did the cap|tain
recollect that his nephew, Tom
Clarke, had been di&s;abled and &s;ecured
in the beginning of the fray. The
truth is, the poor captain had been
&s;o belaboured about the pate, that it
was a wonder he remembered his own
name.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing adventures of chivalry,
equally new and &s;urpri&s;ing.</HEAD>
<P>THE knight Sir Launcelot, and
the novice Crowe, retreated with
equal order and expedition to the di|&s;tance
of half a league from the field
of battle, where the former, halting,
propo&s;ed to make a lodgment in a
very decent hou&s;e of entertainment,
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ign of St. George
of Cappadocia encountering the dra|gon,
an atchievement in which tem|poral
and &s;piritual chivalry were hap|pily
reconciled. Two &s;uch figures
alighting at the inn-gate, did not pa&s;s
through the yard unnoticed and un|admired
by the gue&s;ts and atten|dants;
&s;ome of whom fairly took to
their heels, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that
the&s;e outlandi&s;h creatures were the
avant couriers, or haralds of a French
inva&s;ion. The fears and doubts,
however, of tho&s;e who ventured to
&s;tay were &s;oon di&s;pelled, when our
<PB N="89" REF="92">
hero acco&s;ted them in the Engli&s;h
tongue, and with the mo&s;t courte|ous
demeanour de&s;ired to be &s;hewn
into an apartment. Had captain
Crowe been the &s;poke&s;man, perhaps
their &s;u&s;picions would not have &s;o
quickly &s;ub&s;ided; for he was, in
reality, a very extraordinary novice,
not only in chivalry, but al&s;o in his
external appearance, and particu|larly
in tho&s;e dialects of the Engli&s;h
language which are u&s;ed by the ter|re&s;trial
animals of this kingdom. He
de&s;ired the ho&s;tler to take his hor&s;e
in tow, and bring him to his moor|ings
in a &s;afe riding. He ordered the
waiter, who &s;hewed them into a par|lour,
to bear-a-hand, &s;hip his oars,
mind his helm, and bring along-&s;ide
a &s;hort allowance of brandy or grog,
that he might cant a &s;lug into his
bread-room; for there was &s;uch a
heaving and pitching, that he be|lieved
he &s;hould &s;hift his balla&s;t.
The fellow under&s;tood no part of
this addre&s;s but the word <HI>brandy,</HI> at
mention of which he di&s;appeared.
<PB N="90" REF="93">
Then Crowe, throwing him&s;elf into
an elbow-chair, &startq;Stop my haw&s;e-holes,
(cried he) I can't think what's
the matter, brother; but, agad, my
head &s;ings and &s;immers like a pot of
chowder.&mdash;My eye-&s;ight yaws to
and again, d'ye &s;ee:&mdash;then there's
&s;uch a walloping and whu&s;hing in my
hold&mdash;&s;mite my&mdash;Lord have mercy
upon us.&mdash;Here you &s;wab, ne'er mind
a gla&s;s&mdash;hand me the noggin.&endq;</P>
<P>The latter part of this addre&s;s
was directed to the waiter, who had
returned with a quartern of brandy,
which Crowe, &s;natching eagerly,
&s;tarted into his bread-room at one
cant. Indeed there was no time to
be lo&s;t, ina&s;much as he &s;eemed to
be on the verge of fainting away
when he &s;wallowed this cordial, by
which he was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly re|vived.
He then de&s;ired the &s;ervant
to unbuckle the &s;traps of his helmet;
but this was a ta&s;k which the drawer
could not perform, even though a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed
with the good offices of Sir Laun|celot:
for the head and jaws were
<PB N="91" REF="94">
&s;o much &s;welled with the di&s;cipline
they had undergone, that the &s;traps
and buckles lay buried, as it were,
in pits formed by the tumefaction of
the adjacent parts. Fortunately for
the novice, a neighbouring &s;urgeon
pa&s;&s;ed by the door on hor&s;eback; a
circum&s;tance which the waiter, who
&s;aw him from the window, no &s;ooner
di&s;clo&s;ed, than the knight had recour&s;e
to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This practitioner
having viewed the whole figure, and
more particularly the head of Crowe,
in &s;ilent wonder, proceeded to feel
his pul&s;e; and then declared, that as
the inflammation was very great,
and going on with violence to its
<HI>akme,</HI> it would be nece&s;&s;ary to be|gin
with copious phlebotomy, and
then to empty the inte&s;tinal canal.
So &s;aying, he began to &s;trip the arm
of the captain, who perceiving his
aim, &startq;Ava&s;t, brother, (cried he)
you go the wrong way to work&mdash;you
may as well rummage the afterhold,
when the damage is in the foreca&s;tle.
&mdash;I &s;hall right again, when my jaws
are unhooped.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="95">
With the&s;e words he drew a cla&s;p-knife
from his pocket, and, ad|vancing
to a gla&s;s, applied it &s;o vi|gorou&s;ly
to the leather &s;traps of his
headpiece, that the Gordian-knot
was cut, without any other damage
to his face than a moderate &s;carifi|cation,
which, added to the tume|faction
of features, naturally &s;trong,
and a whole week's growth of a very
bu&s;hy beard, produced, on the whole,
a mo&s;t hideous caricatura. After all,
there was a nece&s;&s;ity for the admini|&s;tration
of the &s;urgeon, who found
divers contu&s;ions on different parts of
the &s;kull, which even the tin-cap
had not been able to protect from the
weapons of the ru&s;ticks.</P>
<P>The&s;e being &s;haved, and dre&s;&s;ed
<HI>&s;ecundum artem,</HI> and the operator di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
with a proper acknowledg|ment,
our knight detached one of
the po&s;t-boys to the field of action
for intelligence, concerning Mr.
Clarke and &s;quire Timothy; and,
in the interim, de&s;ired to know the
particulars of Crowe's adventures
<PB N="93" REF="96">
&s;ince he parted from him at the
White Hart. A connected relation,
in plain Engli&s;h, was what he had
little rea&s;on to expect from the no|vice,
who, neverthele&s;s, exerted his
faculties to the uttermo&s;t for his
&s;atisfaction: he gave him to under|&s;tand,
that in &s;teering his cour&s;e to
Birmingham, where he thought of
fitting him&s;elf with tackle, he had
fallen in, by accident, at a public
hou&s;e, with an itinerant tinker, in
the very act of mending a kettle:
that, &s;eeing him do his bu&s;ine&s;s like
an able workman, he had applied to
him for advice; and the tinker, af|ter
having con&s;idered the &s;ubject, had
undertaken to make him &s;uch a &s;uit
of armour as neither &s;word nor lance
&s;hould penetrate: that they adjourn|ed
to the next town, where the lea|ther
coat, the plates of tinned iron,
the lance, and the broad &s;word, were
purcha&s;ed, together with a copper
&s;auce-pan, which the arti&s;t was now
at work upon, in converting it to a
&s;hield: but, in the mean time, the
<PB N="94" REF="97">
captain, being impatient to begin his
career of chivalry, had accommodat|ed
him&s;elf with a pot-lid, and taken
to the highway, notwith&s;tanding all
the intreaties, tears, and remon&s;tran|ces
of his nephew Tom Clarke, who
could not however be prevailed upon
to leave him in the dangerous voyage
he had undertaken: that this being
but the &s;econd day of his journal, he
de&s;cried five or &s;ix men on hor&s;eback,
bearing up full in his teeth; upon
which he threw his &s;ails a-back, and
prepared for action: that he hailed
them at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and
bad them bring-to: when they came
along-&s;ide, notwith&s;tanding his hail,
he ordered them to clew up their
cor&s;es, and furl their top&s;ails, other|wi&s;e
he would be foul of their quar|ters:
that, hearing this &s;alute, they
luffed all at once, till their cloth
&s;hook in the wind: then he hollow|ed
in a loud voice, that his &s;weetheart
Be&s;&s;elia Mizzen wore the broad pen|dant
of beauty, to which they mu&s;t
&s;trike their top&s;ails, on pain of being
<PB N="95" REF="98">
&s;ent to the bottom: that, after having
eyed him for &s;ome time with a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
they clapped on all their
&s;ails, &s;ome of them running under
his &s;tern, and others athwart his fore|foot,
and got clear off: that, not
&s;atisfied with running a-head, they
all of a &s;udden tacked about, and
one of them boarding him on the
lee-quarter, gave him &s;uch a drub|bing
about his upper works, that the
lights danced in his lanthorns: that
he returned the &s;alute with his hop|pole
&s;o effectually, that his aggre&s;&s;or
broached-to in the twinkling of an
hand-&s;pike; and then he was en|gaged
with all the re&s;t of the enemy,
except one who &s;heered off, and &s;oon
returned with a mo&s;queto fleet of
&s;mall craft, who had done him con|&s;iderable
damage, and, in all pro|bability,
would have made prize of
him, hadn't he been brought off by
the knight's gallantry. He &s;aid, that
in the beginning of the conflict Tom
Clarke rode up to the foremo&s;t of the
enemy, as he did &s;uppo&s;e, in order
<PB N="96" REF="99">
to prevent ho&s;tilities; but before he
got up to him, near enough to hold
di&s;cour&s;e, he was pooped with a &s;ea
that almo&s;t &s;ent him to the bottom,
and then towed off he knew not whi|ther.</P>
<P>Crowe had &s;carce finished his nar|ration,
which con&s;i&s;ted of broken
hints, and unconnected explo&s;ions of
&s;ea-terms, when a gentleman of the
neighbourhood, who acted in the
commi&s;&s;ion of the peace, arrived at
the gate, attended by a con&s;table,
who had in cu&s;tody the bodies of
Thomas Clarke and Timothy Crab|&s;haw,
&s;urrounded by five men on
hor&s;eback, and an innumerable po&s;&s;e
of men, women, and children, on
foot. The captain, who always kept
a good look out, no &s;ooner de&s;cried
this cavalcade and proce&s;&s;ion than he
gave notice to Sir Launcelot, and ad|vi&s;ed
that they &s;hould crowd away
with all the cloth they could carry.
Our adventurer was of another opi|nion,
and determined at any rate to
procure the enlargement of the pri|&s;oners.
<PB N="97" REF="100">
The ju&s;tice, ordering his attend|ants
to &s;tay without the gate, &s;ent his
compliments to Sir Launcelot Greaves,
and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him for a
few minutes. He was immediately
admitted, and could not help &s;tarting
at &s;ight of Crowe, who, by this time,
had no remains of the human phy|&s;iognomy,
&s;o much was the &s;welling
increa&s;ed and the &s;kin di&s;coloured.
The gentleman, who&s;e name was
Mr. Elmy, having made a polite apo|logy
for the liberty he had taken,
proceeded to unfold his bu&s;ine&s;s. He
&s;aid, information had been lodged
with him, as a ju&s;tice of the peace,
again&s;t two armed men on hor&s;eback,
who had &s;topped five farmers on the
king's highway, put them in fear
and danger of their lives, and even
a&s;&s;aulted, maimed, and wounded di|vers
per&s;ons, contrary to the king's
peace; and in violation of the &s;tatute:
that, by the de&s;cription, he &s;uppo&s;ed
the knight and his companion to be
the per&s;ons again&s;t whom the com|plaint
had been lodged; and under|&s;tanding
<PB N="98" REF="101">
his quality from Mr. Clarke,
whom he had known in London, he
was come to wait on him, and, if
po&s;&s;ible, effect an accommodation.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, having thanked
him for the polite and obliging man|ner
in which he proceeded, frankly
told him the whole &s;tory, as it had
been ju&s;t related by the captain; and
Mr. Elmy had no rea&s;on to doubt
the truth of the narrative, as it con|firmed
every circum&s;tance which
Clarke had before reported. Indeed,
Tom had been very communicative
to this gentleman, and made him ac|quainted
with the whole hi&s;tory of
Sir Launcelot Greaves, as well as with
the whim&s;ical re&s;olution of his uncle,
capt. Crowe. Mr. Elmy now told the
knight, that the per&s;ons whom the
captain had &s;topped were farmers, re|turning
from a neighbouring market,
a &s;et of people naturally boori&s;h, and
at that time elevated with ale to an
uncommon pitch of in&s;olence: that
one of them, in particular, called
Prickle, was the mo&s;t quarrel&s;ome
<PB N="99" REF="102">
fellow in the whole county; and &s;o
litigious, that he had maintained
above thirty law-&s;uits, in eight and
twenty of which he had been con|demned
in co&s;ts. He &s;aid the others
might be ea&s;ily influenced in the way
of admonition; but there was no
way of dealing with Prickle, except
by the form and authority of the
law: he therefore propo&s;ed to hear
evidence in a judicial capacity, and,
his clerk being in attendance, the
court was immediately opened in the
knight's apartment.</P>
<P>By this time Mr. Clarke had made
&s;uch good u&s;e of his time in explain|ing
the law to his audience, and di&s;|playing
the great wealth and un|bounded
liberality of Sir Launcelot
Greaves, that he had actually brought
over to his &s;entiments the con&s;table
and the commonalty, tag, rag, and
bob-tail, and even &s;taggered the ma|jority
of the farmers, who, at fir&s;t,
had breathed nothing but defiance
and revenge. Farmer Stake, being
fir&s;t called to the bar, and &s;worn,
<PB N="100" REF="103">
touching the identity of Sir Launce|lot
Greaves and captain Crowe, de|clared,
that the &s;aid Crowe had &s;top|ped
him on the king's highway, and
put him in bodily fear: that he af|terwards
&s;aw the &s;aid Crowe with a
pole or weapon, value three pence,
breaking the king's peace, by com|mitting
a&s;&s;ault and battery again&s;t the
heads and &s;houlders of his maje&s;ty's
liege &s;ubjects, Geoffrey Prickle, Hodge
Dolt, Richard Bumpkin, Mary Fang,
Catherine Rubble, and Margery Lit|ter;
and that he &s;aw Sir Launcelot
Greaves, baronet, aiding, a&s;&s;i&s;ting, and
comforting the &s;aid Crowe, contrary
to the king's peace, and again&s;t the
form of the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked if the defendant, when
he &s;topped them, demanded their
money, or threatened violence, he
an&s;wered, he could not &s;ay, ina&s;much
as the defendant &s;poke in an unknown
language. Being interrogated if the
defendant did not allow them to pa&s;s
without u&s;ing any violence, and if
they did not pa&s;s unmole&s;ted, the de|ponent
<PB N="101" REF="104">
replied in the affirmative:
being required to tell for what rea&s;on
they returned, and if the defendant
Crowe was not a&s;&s;aulted before he be|gan
to u&s;e his weapon, the deponent
made no an&s;wer. The depo&s;itions of
farmer Bumpkin and Muggins, as well
as of Madge Litter and Mary Fang,
were taken much to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e;
and his wor&s;hip earne&s;tly ex|horted
them to an accommodation,
ob&s;erving, that they them&s;elves were
in fact the aggre&s;&s;ors, and that captain
Crowe had done no more than ex|erted
him&s;elf in his own defence.</P>
<P>They were all pretty well di&s;po&s;ed
to follow his advice, except farmer
Prickle, who, entering the court with
a bloody handkerchief about his head,
declared, that the law &s;hould deter|mine
it at next '&s;ize; and in the mean
time in&s;i&s;ted, that the defendants
&s;hould find immediate bail, or go to
pri&s;on, or be &s;et in the &s;tocks. He
affirmed, that they had been guilty
of an <HI>affray,</HI> in appearing with ar|mour
and weapons not u&s;ually worn,
<PB N="102" REF="105">
to the terror of others, which is in
it&s;elf a breach of the peace: but that
they had, moreover, with force of
arms, that is to &s;ay, with &s;words,
&s;taves, and other warlike in&s;truments,
by turns, made an a&s;&s;ault and <HI>affray,</HI>
to the terror and di&s;turbance of him
and divers &s;ubjects of our lord the
king then and there being, and to
the evil and pernicious example of the
liege people of the &s;aid lord the king,
and again&s;t the peace of our &s;aid lord
the king, his crown and dignity.</P>
<P>This pea&s;ant had purcha&s;ed a few
law-terms at a con&s;iderable expence,
and he thought he had a right to turn
his knowledge to the annoyance of
all his neighbours. Mr. Elmy, find|ing
him ob&s;tinately deaf to all pro|po&s;als
of accommodation, held the
defendants to very moderate bail,
the landlord and the curate of the pa|ri&s;h
freely offering them&s;elves as &s;ure|ties.
Mr. Clarke, with Timothy
Crab&s;haw, again&s;t whom nothing ap|peared,
were now &s;et at liberty;
when the former, advancing to his
<PB N="103" REF="106">
wor&s;hip, gave information again&s;t
Geoffrey Prickle, and declared upon
oath, that he had &s;een him a&s;&s;ault
captain Crowe, without any provo|cation;
and when he, the deponent,
interpo&s;ed to prevent further mi&s;chief,
the &s;aid Prickle had likewi&s;e a&s;&s;aulted
and wounded him the deponent, and
detained him for &s;ome time in fal&s;e
impri&s;onment, without warrant or
authority.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this information,
which was corroborated by divers evi|dences,
&s;elected from the mob at the
gate, the tables were turned upon
farmer Prickle, who was given to
under&s;tand, that he mu&s;t either find
bail, or be forthwith impri&s;oned.
This <HI>hone&s;t</HI> boor, who was in opulent
circum&s;tances, had made &s;uch popular
u&s;e of the benefits he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that
there was not an hou&s;ekeeper in the
pari&s;h who would not have rejoiced to
&s;ee him hanged. His dealings and
connections however were &s;uch, that
none of the other four would have
refu&s;ed to bail him, had not Clarke
<PB N="104" REF="107">
given them to under&s;tand, that, if
they did, he would make them all
principals and parties, and have two
&s;eparate actions again&s;t each. Prickle
happened to be at variance with the
inn-keeper, and the curate dur&s;t not
di&s;oblige the vicar, who at that very
time was &s;uing the farmer for the
&s;mall tythes. He offered to depo&s;it a
&s;um equal to the recognizance of the
knight's bail; but this was rejected as
an expedient contrary to the practice
of the courts. He &s;ent for the attor|ney
of the village, to whom he had
been a good cu&s;tomer; but the lawyer
was hunting evidence in another coun|ty.
The exci$eman pre&s;ented him|&s;elf
as a &s;urety; but he not being
an hou&s;ekeeper, was not accepted.
Divers cottagers, who depended on
farmer Prickle, were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively re|fu&s;ed,
becau&s;e they could not prove
that they had payed &s;cot and lot, and
pari&s;h taxes.</P>
<P>The farmer, finding him&s;elf thus
forlorn, and in imminent danger of
vi&s;iting the in&s;ide of a pri&s;on, was
<PB N="105" REF="108">
&s;eized with paroxy&s;m of rage; during
which he inveighed again&s;t the bench,
reviled the two adventurers errant,
declared that he believed, and would
lay a wager of twenty guineas, that
he had more money in his pocket than
e'er a man in the company; and in
the &s;pace of a quarter of an hour
&s;wore forty oaths, which the ju&s;tice
did not fail to number. &startq;Before we
proceed to other matters, (&s;aid Mr.
Elmy) I order you to pay forty &s;hil|lings
for the oaths you have &s;wore;
otherwi&s;e I will cau&s;e you to be &s;et in
the &s;tocks, without further cere|mony.&endq;</P>
<P>Prickle, throwing down a couple
of guineas, with two execrations more
to make up the &s;um, declared, that
he could afford to pay for &s;wearing as
well as e'er a ju&s;tice in the county;
and repeated his challenge of the
wager, which our adventurer now
accepted, prote&s;ting, at the &s;ame time
that it was not a &s;tep taken from
any motive of pride, but intirely with
a view to puni&s;h an in&s;olent plebeian,
<PB N="106" REF="109">
who could not otherwi&s;e be cha&s;ti&s;ed
without a breach of the peace.
Twenty guineas being depo&s;ited on
each &s;ide in the hands of Mr. Elmy,
Prickle, with equal confidence and
di&s;patch, produced a canvas bag, con|taining
two hundred and &s;eventy
pounds, which, being &s;pread upon
the table, made a very formidable
&s;hew, that dazzled the eyes of the
beholders, and induced many of
them to believe he had en&s;ured his
conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, a&s;king if he had
any thing further to offer, and being an|&s;wered
in the negative, drew forth, with
great deliberation, a pocket-book, in
which there was a con&s;iderable parcel
of bank-notes, from which he &s;elect|ed
three of one hundred pounds each,
and exhibited them upon the table,
to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all pre&s;ent.
Prickle, mad with his overthrow and
lo&s;s, &s;aid it might be nece&s;&s;ary to
make him prove the notes were ho|ne&s;tly
come by; and Sir Launcelot
&s;tarted up, in order to take vengeance
<PB N="107" REF="110">
upon him for this in&s;ult; but was with|held
by the arms and remon&s;trances
of Mr. Elmy, who a&s;&s;ured him that
Prickle de&s;ired nothing &s;o much as
another broken head, to lay the foun|dation
of a new pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The knight, calmed by this inter|po&s;ition,
turned to the audience, &s;ay|ing,
with the mo&s;t affable deportment,
&startq;Good people, do not imagine that I
intend to pocket the &s;poils of &s;uch a
contemptible ra&s;cal. I &s;hall beg the
favour of this worthy gentleman to
take up the&s;e twenty guineas, and di&s;|tribute
them as he &s;hall think proper,
among the poor of the pari&s;h: but,
by this benefaction, I do not hold my|&s;elf
acquitted for the &s;hare I had in
the brui&s;es &s;ome of you have re|ceived
in this unlucky fray; and there|fore
I give the other twenty guineas
to be divided among the &s;ufferers, to
each according to the damage he or
&s;he &s;hall appear to have &s;u&s;tained;
and I &s;hall con&s;ider it as an additional
obligation, if Mr. Elmy will likewi&s;e
&s;uperintend this retribution.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111">
At the clo&s;e of this addre&s;s, the
whole yard and gate-way rung with
acclamation: while hone&s;t Crowe,
who&s;e genero&s;ity was not inferior even
to that of the accompli&s;hed Greaves,
pulled out his pur&s;e, and declared, that
as he had begun the engagement, he
would at lea&s;t go &s;hare and &s;hare alike
in new caulking their &s;eams and re|pairing
their timbers. The knight, ra|ther
than enter into a di&s;pute with his
novice, told him, he con&s;idered the
twenty guineas as given by them both
in conjunction, and that they would
confer together on that &s;ubject here|after.</P>
<P>This point being adju&s;ted, Mr. El|my
a&s;&s;umed all the &s;olemnity of the
magi&s;trate, and addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to
Prickle in the&s;e words: &startq;Farmer
Prickle, I am both &s;orry and a&s;hamed
to &s;ee a man of your years and cir|cum&s;tances
&s;o little re&s;pected, that you
cannot find &s;ufficient bail for forty
pounds; a &s;ure te&s;timony that you
have neither cultivated the friend&s;hip,
nor de&s;erved the good will of your
<PB N="109" REF="112">
neighbours. I have heard of your
quarrels and your riots, your in&s;o|lence,
and litigious di&s;po&s;ition; and
often wi&s;hed for an opportunity of
giving you a proper ta&s;te of the law's
correction. That opportunity now
offers&mdash;You have in the hearing of
all the&s;e people poured forth a torrent
of abu&s;e again&s;t me, both in the cha|racter
of a gentleman and of a ma|gi&s;trate:
your abu&s;ing me per&s;onally,
perhaps I &s;hould have overlooked with
the contempt it de&s;erves; but I &s;hould
ill vindicate the dignity of my office
as magi&s;trate, by &s;uffering you to in|&s;ult
the bench with impunity. I &s;hall
therefore impri&s;on you for contempt;
and you &s;hall remain in jail, until you
can find bail on the other pro&s;ecu|tions.&endq;</P>
<P>Prickle, the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his
anger having &s;ub&s;ided, began to be
pricked with the thorns of compunc|tion.
He was indeed exceedingly mor|tified
at the pro&s;pect of being &s;ent to
jail &s;o di&s;gracefully. His countenance
fell, and, after a hard internal &s;truggle,
<PB N="110" REF="113">
while the clerk was employed in writing
the mittimus, he &s;aid he hoped his wor|&s;hip
would not &s;end him to pri&s;on.
He begged pardon of him and our ad|venturers,
for having abu&s;ed them in
his pa&s;&s;ion; and ob&s;erved, that as he
had received a broken head, and payed
two and twenty guineas for his folly,
he could not be &s;aid to have e&s;caped
altogether without puni&s;hment, even if
the plaintiff &s;hould agree to exchange
relea&s;es.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, &s;eeing this &s;tubborn
ru&s;tic effectually humbled, became an
advocate in his favour with Mr. Elmy
and Tom Clarke, who forgave him at
his reque&s;t; and a mutual relea&s;e be|ing
executed, the farmer was permit|ted
to depart. The populace were
regaled at our adventurer's expence;
and the men, women, and children,
who had been wounded or brui&s;ed in
the battle, to the number of ten or a
dozen, were de&s;ired to wait upon Mr.
Elmy in the morning, to receive the
knight's bounty. The ju&s;tice was
prevailed upon to &s;pend the evening
<PB N="111" REF="114">
with Sir Launcelot and his two com|panions,
for whom &s;upper was be|&s;poke;
but the fir&s;t thing the cook
prepared was a poultice for Crowe's
head, which was now enlarged to a
mon&s;trous exhibition. Our knight,
who was all kindne&s;s and complacen|cy,
&s;hook Mr. Clarke by the hand,
expre&s;&s;ing his &s;atisfaction at meeting
with his old friends again, and told
him &s;oftly that he had compliments
for him from Mrs. Dolly Cow&s;lip,
who now lived with his Aurelia.</P>
<P>Clarke was confounded at this in|telligence,
and after &s;ome he&s;itation,
&startq;Lord ble&s;s my &s;oul! (cried he) I'll
be &s;hot then if the pretended Mi&s;s
Meadows wa'n't the &s;ame as Mi&s;s
Darnel!&endq; He then declared him&s;elf
extremely glad that poor Dolly had
got into &s;uch an agreeable &s;ituation,
pa&s;&s;ed many warm encomiums on her
goodne&s;s of heart and virtuous incli|nations,
and concluded with appeal|ing
to the knight whether &s;he did not
look very pretty in her green Jo&s;eph.
In the mean time, he procured a
<PB N="112" REF="115">
plai&s;ter for his own head, and helped
to apply the poultice to that of his un|cle,
who was &s;ent to bed betimes with
a moderate do&s;e of &s;ack-whey, to pro|mote
per&s;piration. The other three
pa&s;&s;ed the evening to their mutual &s;a|tisfaction;
and the ju&s;tice in particu|lar
grew enamoured of the knight's
character, da&s;hed as it was with ex|travagance.</P>
<P>Let us now leave them to the en|joyment
of a &s;ober and rational con|ver&s;ation,
and give &s;ome account of
other gue&s;ts who arrived late in the
evening, and here fixed their night-quarters&mdash;But
as we have already

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which the Rave of Chivalry &s;hine
with renovated Lu&s;tre.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero little dreamed that he
had a formidable rival in the
per&s;on of the knight who arrived
<PB N="113" REF="116">
about eleven at the &s;ign of the St.
George, and, by the noi&s;e he made,
gave intimation of his importance.
This was no other than &s;quire Syca|more,
who, having received advice
that Mi&s;s Aurelia Darnel had eloped
from the place of her retreat, imme|diately
took the field, in que&s;t of that
lovely fugitive; hoping that, &s;hould
he have the good fortune to find her
in her pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, his good offices
would not be rejected. He had fol|lowed
the chace &s;o clo&s;e, that, imme|diately
after our adventurer's depar|ture,
he alighted at the inn from
whence Aurelia had been conveyed;
and there he learned the particulars
which we have related above. Mr.
Sycamore had a great deal of the
childi&s;h romantic in his di&s;po&s;ition,
and, in the cour&s;e of his amours, is
&s;aid to have always taken more plea|&s;ure
in the pur&s;uit than in the final
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He had heard of Sir Laun|celot's
extravagance, by which he was
in &s;ome mea&s;ure infected; and he
dropped an in&s;inuation, that he could
<PB N="114" REF="117">
eclip&s;e his rival even in his own luna|tic
&s;pere. This hint was not lo&s;t up|on
his companion, coun&s;ellor, and
buffoon, the facetious Davy Dawdle,
who had &s;ome humour and a great
deal of mi&s;chief in his compo&s;ition.
He looked upon his patron as a fool,
and his patron knew him to be both
knave and fool: yet the two characters
&s;uited each other &s;o well, that they
could hardly exi&s;t a&s;under. Davy was
an artful &s;ycophant, but he did not
flatter in the u&s;ual way; on the con|trary,
he behaved <HI>en cavalier,</HI> and
treated Sycamore, on who&s;e bounty
he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, with the mo&s;t &s;arca&s;tic
familiarity. Neverthele&s;s, he &s;ea&s;oned
his freedom with certain qualifying
ingredients that &s;ubdued the bitterne&s;s
of it, and was now become &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary
to the &s;quire, that he had no
idea of enjoyment with which Dawdle
was not &s;ome how or other connec|ted.
There had been a warm di&s;|pute
betwixt them about the &s;cheme
of conte&s;ting the prize with Sir Laun|celot
in the li&s;ts of chivalry. Syca|more
<PB N="115" REF="118">
more had in&s;inuated, that if he had
a mind to play the fool, he could
wear armour, wield a launce, and
manage a charger, as well as Sir
Launcelot Greaves. Dawdle &s;natch|ing
the hint, &startq;I had &s;ome time ago,
(&s;aid he) contrived a &s;cheme for you,
which I was afraid you had not ad|dre&s;s
enough to execute&mdash;It would
be no difficult matter, in imitation of
the batchelor Samp&s;on Carra&s;co, to go
in que&s;t of Greaves as a knight errant,
defy him as a rival, and e&s;tabli&s;h a
compact, by which the vanqui&s;hed
&s;hould obey the injunctions of the
victor.&endq;&mdash;&startq;That is my very idea.&endq;
cried Sycamore) &startq;Your idea, (replied
the other) had you ever an idea of
your own conception?&endq;&mdash;Thus the
di&s;pute began, and was maintained
with great vehemence; until other ar|guments
failing, the &s;quire offered to
lay a wager of twenty guineas. To
this propo&s;al Dawdle an&s;wered by the
interjection <HI>Pi&s;h!</HI> which inflamed Sy|camore
to a repetition of the de|fiance.&endq;
&mdash;&startq;You are in the right (&s;aid
<PB N="116" REF="119">
Dawdle) to u&s;e &s;uch an argument, as
you know is by me unan&s;werable. A
wager of twenty guineas will at any
time overthrow and confute all the
logick of the mo&s;t able &s;yllogi&s;t, who
has not got a &s;hilling in his pocket.&endq;</P>
<P>Sycamore looked very grave at this
declaration, and, after a &s;hort pau&s;e,
&s;aid, &startq;I wonder, Dawdle, what you
do with all your money!&endq; &startq;I am
&s;urpri&s;ed you &s;hould give your&s;elf that
trouble&mdash;I never a&s;k what you do
with yours.&endq;&mdash;&startq;You have no occa|&s;ion
to a&s;k: you know pretty well how
it goes.&endq; What! do you upbraid me
with your favours?&mdash;'tis mighty well,
Sycamore.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Nay, Dawdle, I did
not intend to affront.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Z&mdash;s! af|front!
what d'ye mean?&endq;&mdash;&startq;I'll a&s;|&s;ure
you, Davy, you don't know me,
if you think I could be &s;o ungenerous
as to&mdash;a&mdash;to&mdash;&endq; &startq;I always thought,
whatever faults or foibles you might
have, Sycamore, that you was not de|ficient
in genero&s;ity,&mdash;tho' to be &s;ure it
is often very ab&s;urdly di&s;played.&endq; &startq;Ay,
that's one of my greate&s;t foibles: I
<PB N="117" REF="120">
can't refu&s;e even a &s;coundrel, when I
think he is in want.&mdash;Here, Dawdle,
take that note.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Not I, &s;ir,&mdash;what
d'ye mean?&mdash;what right have I to
your notes.&endq; &startq;Nay, but Dawdle,&mdash;come.&endq;&mdash;&startq;By
no means,&mdash;It looks
like the abu&s;e of good nature,&mdash;all the
world knows you're good-natured to
a fault.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Come, dear Davy, you
&s;hall&mdash;you mu&s;t oblige me.&endq;&mdash;Thus
urged, Dawdle accepted the bank note
with great reluctance, and re&s;tored the
idea to the right owner.</P>
<P>A &s;uit of armour being brought
from the garret or armoury of his an|ce&s;tors,
he gave orders for having the
pieces &s;coured and furbi&s;hed up; and
his heart dilated with joy, when he
reflected upon the &s;uperb figure he
&s;hould make when ca&s;ed in complete
&s;teel, and armed at all points for the
combat.</P>
<P>When he was fitted with the other
parts, Dawdle in&s;i&s;ted on buckling on
his helmet, which weighed fifteen
pounds, and the head-piece being ad|ju&s;ted,
made &s;uch a clatter about his
<PB N="118" REF="121">
ears with a cudgel, that his eyes had
almo&s;t &s;tarted from their &s;ockets. His
voice was lo&s;t within the vizor, and
his friend affected not to under&s;tand
his meaning when he made &s;igns with
his gauntlets, and endeavoured to clo&s;e
with him, that he might wre&s;t the
cudgel from his hand. At length he
de&s;i&s;ted, &s;aying, &startq;I'll warrant the hel|met
&s;ound, by its ringing;&endq; and tak|ing
it off, found the &s;quire in a cold
&s;weat. He would have atchieved
his fir&s;t exploit on the &s;pot, had his
&s;trength permitted him to a&s;&s;ault
Dawdle; but, what with want of air,
and the di&s;cipline he had undergone,
he had well nigh &s;wooned away; and
before he retrieved the u&s;e of his mem|bers,
he was appea&s;ed by the apologies
of his companion, who prote&s;ted he
meant nothing more than to try if the
helmet was free of cracks, and whe|ther
or not it would prove a good pro|tection
for the head it covered. His
excu&s;es were accepted: the armour
was packed up, and next morning
Mr. Sycamore &s;et out from his own
<PB N="119" REF="122">
hou&s;e, accompanied by Dawdle, who
undertook to perform the part of his
&s;quire at the approaching combat. He
was al&s;o attended by a &s;ervant on
hor&s;eback, who had charge of the ar|mour,
and another who blowed the
trumpet. They no &s;ooner under&s;tood
that our hero was hou&s;ed at the
George, than the trumpeter &s;ounded
a charge, which alarmed Sir Launce|lot
and his company, and di&s;turbed
hone&s;t captain Crowe in the middle of
his fir&s;t &s;leep. Their next &s;tep was
to pen a challenge, which, when the
&s;tranger departed, was by the trum|peter
delivered with great ceremony
into the hands of Sir Launcelot, who
read it in the&s;e words: &startq;To the
knight of the Cre&s;cent, greeting.
Whereas I am informed you have the
pre&s;umption to lay claim to the heart
of the peerle&s;s Aurelia Darnel, I give
you notice that I can admit no rival|&s;hip
in the affection of that paragon of
beauty; and I expect that you will
either re&s;ign your preten&s;ions, or-make
it appear in &s;ingle combat, according
<PB N="120" REF="123">
to the law of arms, and the in&s;titu|tions
of chivalry, that you are worthy
to di&s;pute her favour with him of the
Griffin. POLYDORE.&endq;</P>
<P>Our adventurer was not a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed
at this addre&s;s, which, howe|ver,
he pocketed in &s;ilence; and be|gan
to reflect, not without mortifica|tion,
that he was treated as a lunatic
by &s;ome per&s;on who wanted to amu&s;e
him&s;elf with the infirmities of his fel|low
creatures. Mr. Thomas Clarke,
who &s;aw the ceremony with which
the letter was delivered, and the emo|tions
with which it was read, hied
him to the kitchen for intelligence,
and there learned that the &s;tranger
was &s;quire Sycamore. He forthwith
comprehended the nature of the bil|let,
and, in the apprehen&s;ion that
blood&s;hed would en&s;ue, re&s;olved to
alarm his uncle, that he might a&s;&s;i&s;t
in keeping the peace. He according|ly
entered the apartment of the captain,
who had been waked by the trum|pet,
and now peevi&s;hly a&s;ked the
meaning of that damned piping, as
<PB N="121" REF="124">
if all hands were called upon deck.
Clarke having imparted what he knew
of the tran&s;action, together with his
own conjectures, the captain &s;aid, he
did not &s;uppo&s;e as how they would
engage by candle-light; and that for
his own part he &s;hould turn out in
the larboard watch, long enough be|fore
any &s;ignals could be hove out for
forming the line. With this a&s;&s;urance
the lawyer retired to his ne&s;t, where
he did not fail to dream of Mrs. Dol|ly
Cow&s;lip; while Sir Launcelot pa&s;|&s;ed
the night awake, in ruminating on
the &s;trange challenge he had received.
He had got notice that the &s;ender was
Mr. Sycamore, and he&s;itated with
him&s;elf whether he &s;hould not puni&s;h
him for his impertinence: but when
he reflected on the nature of the di&s;|pute,
and the &s;erious con&s;equences it
might produce, he re&s;olved to decline
the combat, as a trial of right and me|rit,
founded upon ab&s;urdity. Even
in his madde&s;t hours, he never adopt|ed
tho&s;e maxims of knight-erran|try
which related to challenges. He
<PB N="122" REF="125">
always perceived the folly and wicked|ne&s;s
of defying a man to mortal fight,
becau&s;e he did not like the colour of
his beard, or the complexion of his
mi&s;tre&s;s; or of deciding by homicide,
whether he or his rival de&s;erved the
preference, when it was the lady's
prerogative to determine which &s;hould
be the happy lover. It was his opi|nion
that chivalry was an u&s;eful in&s;ti|tution
while confined to its original
purpo&s;es of protecting the innocent,
a&s;&s;i&s;ting the friendle&s;s, and bringing
the guilty to condign puni&s;hment:
but he could not conceive how the&s;e
laws &s;hould be an&s;wered by violating
every &s;ugge&s;tion of rea&s;on, and every
precept of humanity. Captain Crowe
did not examine the matter &s;o philo|&s;ophically.
He took it for granted
that in the morning the two knights
would come to action, and &s;lept &s;ound
on that &s;uppo&s;ition. But he ro&s;e be|fore
it was day, re&s;olved to be &s;ome
how concerned in the fray; and un|der&s;tanding
that the &s;tranger had a
companion, &s;et him down immediate|ly
<PB N="123" REF="126">
for his own antagoni&s;t. So impa|tient
was he to e&s;tabli&s;h this &s;econdary
conte&s;t, that by day-break he entered
the chamber of Dawdle, to which he
was directed by the waiter, and rou&s;ed
him with a hilloah, that might have
been heard at the di&s;tance of half a
league. Dawdle, &s;tartled by this ter|rific
&s;ound, &s;prung out of bed, and
&s;tood upright on the floor, before he
opened his eyes upon the object by
which he had been &s;o dreadfully
alarmed. But when he beheld the
head of Crowe, &s;o &s;welled and &s;wa|thed,
&s;o livid, hideous, and griefly,
with a broad &s;word by his &s;ide, and a
ca&s;e of pi&s;tols in his girdle, he believed
it was the apparition of &s;ome mur|thered
man; his hair bri&s;tled up, his
teeth chattered, and his knees knock|ed;
he would have prayed, but his
tongue denied its office. Crowe &s;ee|ing
his perturbation, &startq;May-hap,
friend, &s;aid he, you take me for a
buccaneer: but I am no &s;uch per|&s;on.&mdash;My
name it is captain Crowe.&mdash;I
come not for your &s;ilver nor your
<PB N="124" REF="127">
gold; your rigging nor your &s;towage;
but hearing as how your friend in|tends
to bring my friend Sir Launce|lot
Greaves to action, d'ye &s;ee; I de|&s;ire
in the way of friend&s;hip, that,
while they are engaged, you and I, as
their &s;econds, may lie board and board
for a few gla&s;&s;es, to divert one ano|ther,
d'ye &s;ee.&endq; Dawdle hearing this
reque&s;t, began to retrieve his facul|ties,
and throwing him&s;elf into the
attitude of Hamlet, when the gho&s;t
appears, exclaimed in theatrical ac|cent,
&startq;Angels and mini&s;ters of grace
defend us!&mdash;Art thou a &s;pirit of
grace, or goblin damn'd?&endq;&mdash;As he
&s;eemed to bend his eye on vacancy,
the captain began to think that he
really &s;aw &s;omething preternatural,
and &s;tared wildly around. Then ad|dre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf to the terrified Daw|dle,
&startq;Damn'd, (&s;aid he) for what
&s;hould I be damn'd? If you are afeard
of goblins, brother, put your tru&s;t in
the Lord, and he'll prove a &s;heet-an|chor
to you.&endq; The other having by
this time recollected him&s;elf perfect|ly,
<PB N="125" REF="128">
continued, notwith&s;tanding, to
&s;pout tragedy, and in the words of
Macbeth pronounced,</P>
<LG>
<L>&startq;What man dare, I dare:</L>
<L>Approach thou like the rugged Ru&s;|&s;ian
bear,</L>
<L>The armed rhinoceros, or Hyrca|nian
tyger;</L>
<L>Take any &s;hape but that, and my
firm nerves</L>
<L>Shall never tremble.&endq;&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>&startq;'Ware names, Jack, (cried the im|patient
mariner) if &s;o be as how you'll
bear a hand and rig your&s;elf, and take
a &s;hort trip with me into the offing,
we'll overhaul this here affair in the
turning of a cap&s;tan.&endq;</P>
<P>At this juncture they were joined
by Mr. Sycamore in his night-gown
and &s;lippers. Di&s;turbed by Crowe's
fir&s;t &s;alute he had &s;prung up, and now
expre&s;&s;ed no &s;mall a&s;toni&s;hment at
fir&s;t &s;ight of the novice's countenance.
After having gazed alternately at him
and Dawdle, &startq;Who have we got
here, &s;aid he, raw head and bloody
<PB N="126" REF="129">
bones?&endq; when his friend, &s;lipping on
his cloaths, gave him to under&s;tand
that this was a friend of Sir Launce|lot
Greaves, and explained the pur|port
of his errant, he treated him with
more civility. He a&s;&s;ured him that
he &s;hould have the plea&s;ure to break
a &s;pear with Mr. Dawdle; and &s;igni|fied
his &s;urprize that Sir Launcelot had
made no an&s;wer to his letter. It be|ing
by this time clear day-light, and
Crowe extremely intere&s;ted in this af|fair,
he broke without ceremony in|to
the knight's chamber, and told him
abruptly that the enemy had brought
to, and waited for his coming up, in
order to begin the action. &startq;I've
hailed his confort, &s;aid he, a &s;ham|bling
chattering fellow: he took me
fir&s;t for a hobgoblin, then called me
names, a tyger, a wryno&s;e o'ro&s;s, and
a Per&s;ian bear; but egad, if I come
athwart him, I'll make him look like
the bear and ragged &s;taff before we
part.&mdash;I wool.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>This intimation was not received
with that alacrity which the captain
<PB N="127" REF="130">
expected to find in our adventurer,
who told him in a peremptory tone,
that he had no de&s;ign to come to ac|tion,
and de&s;ired to be left to his re|po&s;e.
Crowe forthwith retired cre&s;t-fallen,
and muttered &s;omething which
was never di&s;tinctly heard.</P>
<P>About eight in the morning Mr.
Dawdle brought him a formal me&s;|&s;age
from the knight of the Griffin,
de&s;iring he would appoint the li&s;ts,
and give &s;ecurity of the field. To
which reque&s;t he made an&s;wer in a
very compo&s;ed and &s;olemn accent,
&startq;If the per&s;on who &s;ent you thinks
I have injured him, let him without
di&s;gui&s;e, or any &s;uch ridiculous cere|mony,
explain the nature of the
wrong; and then I &s;hall give &s;uch
&s;atisfaction as may &s;uit my con&s;cience
and my character. If he hath be|&s;towed
his affection upon any particu|lar
object, and looks upon me as a
favoured rival, I &s;hall not wrong the
lady &s;o much as to take any &s;tep that
may prejudice her choice, e&s;pecially
a &s;tep that contradicts my own rea&s;on
<PB N="128" REF="131">
as much as it would outrage the laws
of my country. If he who calls him|&s;elf
knight of the Griffin is really de|&s;irous
of treading in the paths of true
chivalry, he will not want opportu|nities
of &s;ignalizing his valour in the
cau&s;e of virtue.&mdash;Should he, notwith|&s;tanding
this declaration, offer vio|lence
to me in the cour&s;e of my occa|&s;ions,
he will always find me in a
po&s;ture of defence: or, &s;hould he
per&s;i&s;t in repeating his importunities,
I &s;hall without ceremony cha&s;ti&s;e the
me&s;&s;enger.&endq; His declining the com|bat
was interpreted into fear by Mr.
Sycamore, who now became more in|&s;olent
and ferocious, on the &s;uppo&s;i|tion
of our knight's timidity. Sir
Launcelot mean while went to break|fa&s;t
with his friends, and having put
on his armour, ordered the hor&s;es to
be brought forth. Then he payed
the bill, and walking deliberately to
the gate, in pre&s;ence of &s;quire Syca|more
and his attendants, vaulted at
one &s;pring into the &s;addle of Bronzo|marte,
<PB N="129" REF="132">
who&s;e neighing and curvet|ting
proclaimed the joy he felt in
being mounted by his accompli&s;hed
ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Though the knight of the Griffin
did not think proper to in&s;ult his
rival per&s;onally, his friend Dawdle
did not fail to crack &s;ome jokes on
the figure and hor&s;eman&s;hip of Crowe,
who again declared he &s;hould be glad
to fall in with him upon the voyage:
nor did Mr. Clarke's black patch and
rueful countenance pa&s;s unnoticed and
unridiculed. As for Timothy Crab|&s;haw,
he beheld his brother &s;quire
with the contempt of a veteran: and
Gilbert payed him his compliments
with his heels at parting: but when
our adventurer and his retinue were
clear of the 'inn, Mr. Sycamore or|dered
his trumpeter to &s;ound a re|treat,
by way of triumph over his an|tagoni&s;t.
Perhaps he would have
contented him&s;elf with this kind of
victory, had not Dawdle further in|flamed
his envy and ambition, by
launching out in prai&s;e of Sir Launce|lot,
<PB N="130" REF="133">
He ob&s;erved that his counte|nance
was open and manly; his joints
&s;trong knit, and his form unexception|able;
that he trod like Hercules, and
vaulted into the &s;addle like a winged
Mercury: nay, he even hinted it was
lucky for Sycamore that the knight
of the Cre&s;cent happened to be &s;o
pacifically di&s;po&s;ed. His patron &s;ick|ened
at the&s;e prai&s;es, and took fire at
the la&s;t ob&s;ervation. He affected to
undervalue per&s;onal beauty, though
the opinion of the world had been
favourable to him&s;elf in that parti|cular:
he &s;aid he was at lea&s;t two
inches taller than Greaves; and as
to &s;hape and air, he would make
no compari&s;ons; but with re&s;pect to
riding, he was &s;ure he had a better
&s;eat than Sir Launcelot, and would
wager five hundred to fifty guineas,
that he would unhor&s;e him at the fir&s;t
encounter. &startq;There is no occa&s;ion
for laying wagers, replied Mr. Daw|dle,
the doubt may be determined in
half an hour&mdash;Sir Launcelot is not a
man to avoid you at full gallop.&endq;
<PB N="131" REF="134">
Sycamore, after &s;ome he&s;itation, de|clared
he would follow and provoke
him to battle, on condition that
Dawdle would engage Crowe; and
this condition was accepted: for,
though Davy had no &s;tomach to the
tryal, he could not readily find an
excu&s;e for declining it: be&s;ides, he
had di&s;covered the captain to be a
very bad hor&s;eman, and re&s;olved to
eke out his own &s;canty valour with a
border of ingenuity. The &s;ervants
were immediately ordered to unpack
the armour, and, in a little time,
Mr. Sycamore made a very formi|dable
appearance. But the &s;cene
that followed is too important to be
huddled in at the end of a chapter;
and therefore we &s;hall re&s;erve it for
a more con&s;picuous place in the&s;e
memoirs.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing the atchievements of the
knights of the Griffin and Cre&s;cent.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Sycamore, alias the knight
of the Griffin, &s;o denominated
from a griffin painted on his &s;hield,
being armed at all points, and his
friend Dawdle provided with a certain
implement, which he flattered him|&s;elf
would en&s;ure a victory over the
novice Crowe; they &s;et out from the
George, with their attendants, in all
the elevation of hope, and pranced
along the highway that led towards
London, that being the road which
our adventurer pur&s;ued. As they
were extremely well mounted, and
proceeded at a round pace, they, in
le&s;s than two hours, came up with
Sir Launcelot and his company;
and Sycamore &s;ent another formal
defiance to the knight, by his trum|peter,
Dawdle having for good rea|&s;ons,
declined that office.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136">
Our adventurer hearing him&s;elf
thus addre&s;&s;ed, and &s;eeing his rival,
who had pa&s;&s;ed him, po&s;ted to ob|&s;truct
his progre&s;s, armed capapie,
with his lance in the re&s;t; determined
to give the &s;atisfaction that was requir|ed,
and de&s;ired that the regulations of
the combat might be e&s;tabli&s;hed. The
knight of the Griffin propo&s;ed, that
the vanqui&s;hed party &s;hould re&s;ign all
preten&s;ions to Mi&s;s Aurelia Darnel, in
favour of the victor; that while the
principals were engaged, his friend
Dawdle &s;hould run a tilt with captain
Crowe; that &s;quire Crab&s;haw, and
Mr. Sycamore's &s;ervant, &s;hould keep
them&s;elves in readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t their
re&s;pective ma&s;ters occa&s;ionally, ac|cording
to the law of arms; and that
Mr. Clarke &s;hould ob&s;erve the motions
of the trumpeter, who&s;e province was
to &s;ound the charge to battle.</P>
<P>Our knight agreed to the&s;e regula|tions,
notwith&s;tanding the earne&s;t and
pathetic remon&s;trances of the young
lawyer, who, with tears in his eyes,
conjured all the combatants, in their
<PB N="134" REF="137">
turns, to refrain from an action that
might be attended with blood&s;hed
and murder; and was contrary to the
laws both of God and man. In vain
he endeavoured to move them by
tears and entreaties, by threatning
them with pro&s;ecutions in this world,
and pains and penalties in the next:
they per&s;i&s;ted in their re&s;olution, and
his uncle would have begun ho&s;tilities
on his carca&s;e, had not he been pre|vented
by Sir Launcelot, who ex|horted
Clarke to retire from the field,
that he might not be involved in the
con&s;equences of the combat. He re|li&s;hed
this advice &s;o well, that he had
actually moved off to &s;ome di&s;tance;
but his apprehen&s;ion and concern for
his friends co-operating with an in|&s;atiable
curio&s;ity, detained him in
&s;ight of the engagement.</P>
<P>The two knights having fairly di|vided
the ground, and the &s;ame pre|cautions
being taken by the &s;econds,
on another part of the field, Syca|more
began to be invaded with &s;ome
&s;cruples, which were probably engen|dered
<PB N="135" REF="138">
by the martial appearance, and
well known character of his antago|ni&s;t.
The confidence which he had
derived from the reluctance of Sir
Launcelot now vani&s;hed, becau&s;e it
plainly appeared, that the knight's
backwardne&s;s was not owing to per|&s;onal
timidity; and he fore&s;aw that
the pro&s;ecution of this joke might be
attended with very &s;erious con&s;equen|ces
to his own life and reputation.
He, therefore, de&s;ired a parley, in
which he ob&s;erved his affection for
Mi&s;s Darnel was of &s;uch a delicate
nature, that &s;hould the di&s;comfiture
of his rival contribute to make her
unhappy, his victory mu&s;t render him
the mo&s;t mi&s;erable wretch upon earth.
He propo&s;ed, therefore, that her &s;en|timents
and choice &s;hould be a&s;cer|tained
before they proceeded to extre|mity.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot declared that he was
much more afraid of combating Au|relia's
inclination, than of oppo&s;ing
the knight of the Griffin in arms;
and that if he had the lea&s;t rea&s;on to
<PB N="136" REF="139">
think Mr. Sycamore, or any other
per&s;on, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by her pre|ference,
he would in&s;tantly give up
his &s;uit as de&s;perate. At the &s;ame
time, he ob&s;erved that Sycamore had
proceeded too far to retract; that he
had in&s;ulted a gentleman, and not
only challenged, but even pur&s;ued
him, and blocked up his pa&s;&s;age in
the public highway; outrages which
he (Sir Launcelot) would not &s;uffer
to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed. Accordingly, he
in&s;i&s;ted on the combat, on pain of
treating Mr. Sycamore as a craven,
and a recreant. This declaration was
reinforced by Dawdle, who told him
that &s;hould he now decline the en|gagement,
all the world would look
upon him as an infamous poltroon.</P>
<P>The&s;e two ob&s;ervations gave a ne|ce&s;&s;ary
fillip to the courage of the
challenger. The parties took their
&s;tations: the trumpet &s;ounded to
charge, and the combatants began
their career with great impetuo&s;ity.
Whether the gleam of Sir Launce|lot's
arms affrighted Mr. Sycamore's
<PB N="137" REF="140">
&s;teed, or &s;ome other object had an
unlucky effect on his eye-&s;ight; certain
it is he &s;tarted at about midway, and
gave his rider &s;uch a violent &s;hake as
di&s;compo&s;ed his attitude, and di&s;abled
him from u&s;ing his lance to the be&s;t ad|vantage.
Had our hero continued his
career, with his launce couched, in
all probability Sycamore's armour
would have proved but a bad defence
to his carca&s;e: but Sir Launcelot per|ceiving
his rival's &s;pear unre&s;ted, had
ju&s;t time to throw up the point of his
own, when the two hor&s;es clo&s;ed
with &s;uch a &s;hock, that Sycamore,
already wavering in the &s;addle, was
overthrown, and his armour cra&s;hed
around him as he fell.</P>
<P>The victor, &s;eeing him lie without
motion, alighted immediately and be|gan
to unbuckle his helmet, in which
office he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the trumpe|ter.
When the head-piece was re|moved,
the haple&s;s knight of the
Griffin appeared in the pale livery of
death, tho' he was only in a &s;woon,
from which he &s;oon recovered by the
<PB N="138" REF="141">
effect of the fre&s;h air, and the a&s;per|&s;ion
of cold water, brought from a
&s;mall pool in the neighbourhood.
When he recognized his conqueror
doing the offices of humanity about
his per&s;on, he clo&s;ed his eyes from
vexation, told Sir Launcelot that his
was the fortune of the day, tho' he
him&s;elf owed his mi&s;chance to the
fault of his own hor&s;e; and ob&s;erved
that this ridiculous affair would not
have happened, but for the mi&s;chie|vous
in&s;tigation of that &s;coundrel
Dawdle, on who&s;e ribs he threatened
to revenge his mishap.</P>
<P>Perhaps captain Crowe might have
&s;aved him this trouble, had that wag
honourably adhered to the in&s;titutions
of chivalry, in his conflict with our
novice: but on this occa&s;ion, his in|genuity
was more commendable than
his courage. He had provided at the
inn a blown bladder, in which &s;eve|ral
&s;mooth pebbles were inclo&s;ed;
and this he &s;lily fixed on the head
of his pole, when the captain obeyed
the &s;ignal of battle. In&s;tead of bear|ing
<PB N="139" REF="142">
the brunt of the encounter, he
turned out of the &s;traight line, &s;o as
to avoid the launce of his antagoni&s;t,
and rattled his bladder with &s;uch ef|fect,
that Crowe's hor&s;e pricking up
his ears, took to his heels, and fled
acro&s;s &s;ome ploughed land with &s;uch
precipitation, that the rider was obliged
to quit his &s;pear, and lay fa&s;t hold on
the mane, that he might not be thrown
out of the &s;addle. Dawdle, who was
much better mounted, &s;eeing his con|dition,
rode up to the unfortunate no|vice,
and belaboured his &s;houlders
without fear of retaliation. Mr.
Clarke, &s;eeing his kin&s;man &s;o roughly
handled, forgot his fears, and flew to
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but, before he came
up, the aggre&s;&s;or had retired, and
now perceiving that fortune had de|clared
again&s;t his friend and patron,
very honourably abandoned him in
his di&s;tre&s;s, and went off at full &s;peed
for London.</P>
<P>Nor was Timothy Crab&s;haw with|out
his &s;hare in the noble atchieve|ments
of this propitious day. He
<PB N="140" REF="143">
had by this time imbibed &s;uch a tinc|ture
of errantry, that he firmly be|lieved
him&s;elf and his ma&s;ter equally
invincible; and this belief operating
upon a perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, rendered
him as quarrel&s;ome in his &s;phere, as
his ma&s;ter was mild and forbearing.
As he &s;at on hor&s;eback, in the place
a&s;&s;igned to him and Sycamore's lac|quey,
he managed Gilbert in &s;uch a
manner, as to invade with his heels,
the po&s;teriors of the other's hor&s;e;
and this in&s;ult produced &s;ome alterca|tion,
which ended in mutual a&s;&s;ault.
The footman handled the butt-end
of his hor&s;e-whip with great dexte|rity
about the head of Crab&s;haw, who
declared afterwards, that it &s;ung and
&s;immered like a kettle of cod-fi&s;h:
but the &s;quire who under&s;tood the na|ture
of long la&s;hes, as having been a
carter from his infancy, found means
to twine his thong about the neck of
his antagoni&s;t, and pull him off his
hor&s;e half &s;trangled, at the very in|&s;tant
his ma&s;ter was thrown by Sir
Launcelot Greaves.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="144">
Having thus obtained the victory,
he did not much regard the punc|tilios
of chivalry; but taking it for
granted he had a right to make the
mo&s;t of his advantage, re&s;olved to
carry off the <HI>&s;polia opima.</HI> Alighting
with great agility, &startq;Brother, (cried
he) I think as haw yawrs bean't a
butcher's hor&s;e, a doan't carry calves
well&mdash;I'&s;e make yaw knaw your
churning days, I wool&mdash;what yaw
look as if yaw was crow-trodden,
you do&mdash;now, you &s;hall pay the
&s;core you have been running on my
peate, you &s;hall, brother.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he rifled his pockets,
&s;tripped him of his hat and coat,
and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ma&s;ter's
portmanteau. But he did not long
enjoy his plunder: for the lacquey
complaining to Sir Launcelot, of his
having been de&s;poiled, the knight
commanded his &s;quire to refund, not
without menaces of &s;ubjecting him
to the &s;evere&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ement, for his
inju&s;tice and rapacity. Timothy re|pre&s;ented,
with great vehemence, that
<PB N="142" REF="145">
he had won the &s;poils in fair battle,
at the expence of his head and &s;houl|ders,
which he immediately unco|vered,
to prove his allegation: but his
remon&s;trance having no effect upon
his ma&s;ter, &startq;Wounds! (cried he) an
I mun gee thee back the pig, I'&s;e gee
thee back the poke al&s;o; I'm a drub|bing
&s;till in thy debt.&endq;</P>
<P>With the&s;e words, he made a
mo&s;t furious attack upon the plaintiff,
with his hor&s;e-whip, and before the
knight could interpo&s;e, repayed the
lacquey with intere&s;t. As an appur|tenance
to Sycamore and Dawdle, he
ran the ri&s;que of another a&s;&s;ault from
the novice Crowe, who was &s;o tran&s;|ported
with rage, at the di&s;agreeable
trick which had been played upon
him, by his fugitive antagoni&s;t, that
he could not for &s;ome time pronounce
an articulate &s;ound, but a few broken
interjections, the meaning of which
could not be a&s;certained. Snatching
up his pole, he ran towards the place
where Mr. Sycamore &s;at on the gra&s;s,
&s;upported by the trumpeter, and
would have fini&s;hed what our adven|turer
<PB N="143" REF="146">
had left undone, if the knight
of the Cre&s;cent, with admirable dex|terity,
had not warded off the blow
which he aimed at the knight of the
Griffin, and &s;ignified his di&s;plea&s;ure
in a re&s;olute tone: then he collared
the lacquey, who was ju&s;t di&s;engaged
from the cha&s;ti&s;ing hand of Crab&s;haw,
and &s;winging his launce with his other
hand, encountered the &s;quire's ribs by
accident.</P>
<P>Timothy was not &s;low in return|ing
the &s;alutation, with the weapon
which he &s;till wielded: Mr. Clarke,
running up to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his
uncle, was oppo&s;ed by the lacquey,
who &s;eemed extremely de&s;irous of
&s;eeing the enemy revenge his quarrel,
by falling foul of one another. Clarke,
thus impeded, commenced ho&s;tilities
again&s;t the footman, while Crowe
grappled with Crab&s;haw; a battle-royal
in&s;ued, and was maintained with
great vigour, and &s;ome blood&s;hed on
all &s;ides, until the authority of Sir
Launcelot, reinforced by &s;ome weighty
remon&s;trances, applied to the &s;quire,
<PB N="144" REF="147">
put an end to the conflict. Crab&s;haw
immediately de&s;i&s;ted, and ran roaring
to communicate his grievances to
Gilbert, who &s;eemed to &s;ympathize
very little with his di&s;tre&s;s. The lac|quey
took to his heels; Mr Clarke
wiped his bloody no&s;e, declaring he
had a good mind to put the aggre&s;|&s;or
in the Crown-office; and captain
Crowe continued to ejaculate uncon|nected
oaths, which, however, &s;eem|ed
to imply that he was almo&s;t &s;ick of
his new profe&s;&s;ion. &startq;D&mdash;n my eyes,
if you call this&mdash;&s;tart my timbers,
brother&mdash;look ye, d'ye &s;ee&mdash;a lou&s;y,
lubberly, cowardly &s;on of a&mdash;among
the breakers, d'ye &s;ee&mdash;lo&s;t my
&s;teerage way&mdash;&s;plit my binnacle;

me a tight ve&s;&s;el, d'ye &s;ee, bro|ther&mdash;mayhap
you may'nt&mdash;&s;natch
my&mdash;&s;ea room and a &s;panking gale&mdash;o$ds
heart, I'll hold a whole year's&mdash;&s;mite
my limbs: it don't &s;ignify talk|ing.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Our hero con&s;oled the novice for
his di&s;a&s;ter, by ob&s;erving, that if he
<PB N="145" REF="148">
had got &s;ome blows, he had lo&s;t no
honour. At the &s;ame time, he ob|&s;erved
that it was very difficult, if not
impo&s;&s;ible, for a man to &s;ucceed in
the paths of chivalry, who had pa&s;&s;ed
the better part of his days in other
occupations; and hinted that as the
cau&s;e which had engaged him in this
way of life no longer exi&s;ted, he was
determined to relinqui&s;h a profe&s;&s;ion,
which, in a peculiar manner, expo&s;ed
him to the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable incidents.
Crowe chewed the cud upon this in|&s;inuation,
while the other per&s;onages
of the Drama were employed in
catching the hor&s;es, which had given
their riders the &s;lip. As for Mr. Sy|camore,
he was &s;o brui&s;ed by his fall,
that it was nece&s;&s;ary to procure a lit|ter
for conveying him to the next
town, and the &s;ervant was di&s;patched
for this convenience; Sir Launcelot
&s;taying with him until it arrived.</P>
<P>When he was &s;afely depo&s;ited in
the carriage, our hero took leave of
him in the&s;e terms. &startq;I &s;hall not
in&s;i&s;t upon your &s;ubmitting to the
<PB N="146" REF="149">
terms, you your&s;elf propo&s;ed before
this rencounter. I give you free leave
to u&s;e all your advantages, in an ho|nourable
way, for promoting your
&s;uit with the young lady, of whom
you profe&s;s your&s;elf enamoured.
Should you have recour&s;e to fini&s;ter
practices, you will find Sir Launcelot
Greaves ready to demand an account
of your conduct, not in the character
of a lunatic knight-errant, but as a
plain Engli&s;h gentleman, jealous of
his honour, and re&s;olute in his pur|po&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>To this addre&s;s Mr. Sycamore
made no reply, but with a &s;ullen
a&s;pect ordered the carriage to pro|ceed;
and it moved accordingly to
the right, our hero's road to London
lying in the other direction. Sir
Launcelot had already exchanged his
armour for a riding-coat, hat, and
boots; and Crowe parting with his
&s;kull-cap and leathern jerkin, regain|ed
in &s;ome re&s;pects the appearance of
a human creature. Thus metamor|pho&s;ed,
they pur&s;ued their way in an
<PB N="147" REF="150">
ea&s;y pace, Mr. Clarke endeavouring
to amu&s;e them with a learned di&s;&s;er|tation
on the law, tending to demon|&s;trate
that Mr. Sycamore was, by his
behaviour of that day, liable to three
different actions, be&s;ides a commi&s;&s;ion
of lunacy; and that Dawdle might
be pro&s;ecuted for having practi&s;ed
&s;ubtle craft, to the annoyance of his
uncle, over and above an action for
a&s;&s;ault and battery; becau&s;e, for why?
The &s;aid Crowe having run away, as
might be ea&s;ily proved, before any
blows were given, the &s;aid Dawdle
by pur&s;uing him even out of the
high road, putting him in fear, and
committing battery on his body, be|came,
to all intents and purpo&s;es, the
aggre&s;&s;or; and an indictment would
lie in <HI>Banco Regis.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain's pride was &s;o &s;hock|ed
at the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that he ex|claimed
with equal rage and impa|tience,
&startq;You lie, you dog, in <HI>Bil|kum
Regis</HI>&mdash;you lie, I &s;ay, you lub|ber,
I did not run away; nor was I
in fear, d'ye &s;ee. It was my &s;on of
<PB N="148" REF="151">
a bitch of a hor&s;e that would not
obey the helm, d'ye &s;ee, whereby I
coudn't u&s;e my metal, d'ye &s;ee&mdash;As
for the matter of fear, you and fear
my ki&s;s my&mdash;So don't go and heave
your &s;tink-pots at my character, d'ye
&s;ee, or agad I'll trim thee fore and
aft with a&mdash;I wool.&endq; Tom prote&s;ted
he meant nothing but a little &s;pecula|tion,
and Crowe was appea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the evening they reached the
town of Bugden, without any farther
adventure, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in
great tranquility. Next morning,
even after the hor&s;es were ordered to
be &s;addled, Mr. Clarke, without cere|mony,
entered the apartment of Sir
Launcelot, leading in a female, who
proved to be the identical Mrs. Dolly
Cow&s;lip. This young woman ad|vancing
to the knight, cried, &startq;O,
Sir Launcelot! my dear leady, my
dear leady&endq;&mdash;but was hindered from
proceeding by a flood of tears which
the tender hearted lawyer mingled
with a plentiful &s;hower of &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>Our adventurer &s;tarting at this
<PB N="149" REF="152">
exclamation, &startq;O heavens! (cried he)
where is my Aurelia? &s;peak, where
did you leave that jewel of my &s;oul?
an&s;wer me in a moment&mdash;I am all
terror and impatience!&endq; Dolly hav|ing
recollected her&s;elf, told him that
Mr. Darnel had lodged his niece in
the new buildings by May-fair; that
on the &s;econd night after their arrival,
a very warm expo&s;tulation had pa&s;&s;ed
between Aurelia and her uncle, who
next morning di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Dolly, with|out
permitting her to take leave of
her mi&s;tre&s;s, and that &s;ame day moved
to another part of the town, as &s;he
afterwards learned of the landlady,
though &s;he could not inform her
whither they were gone. That when
&s;he was turned away, John Clump,
one of the footmen, who pretended
to have a kindne&s;s for her, had faith|fully
promi&s;ed to call upon her and
let her know what pa&s;&s;ed in the fa|mily;
but as he did not keep his word,
and &s;he was an utter &s;tranger in Lon|don,
without friends or &s;ettlement,
&s;he had re&s;olved to return to her mo|ther,
<PB N="150" REF="153">
and travelled &s;o far on foot &s;ince
ye&s;terday morning.</P>
<P>Our knight, who had expected the
mo&s;t di&s;mal tidings from her lament|able
preamble, was plea&s;ed to find
his pre&s;aging fears di&s;appointed; tho'
he was far from being &s;atisfied with
the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Dolly, from who&s;e
attachment to his intere&s;t, joined to
her influence over Mr. Clump, he had
hoped to reap &s;uch intelligence as
would guide him to the haven of his
de&s;ires. After a minute's reflection,
he &s;aw it would be expedient to carry
back Mrs. Cow&s;lip, and lodge her at
the place where Mr. Clump had pro|mi&s;ed
to vi&s;it her with intelligence;
for, in all probability, it was not for
want of inclination that he had not
kept his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Dolly did not expre&s;s any aver&s;ion
to the &s;cheme of returning to Lon|don,
where &s;he hoped once more to
rejoin her dear lady, to whom by this
time, &s;he was attached by the &s;trong|e&s;t
ties of affection; and her inclina|tion,
in this re&s;pect, was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
<PB N="151" REF="154">
the con&s;ideration of having the compa|ny
of the young lawyer, who, it plain|ly
appeared, had made &s;trange havock
in her heart, tho' it mu&s;t be owned, for
the honour of this blooming dam&s;el,
that her thoughts had never once deviat|ed
from the paths of innocence and
virtue. The more Sir Launcelot &s;ur|veyed
this agreeable maiden, the more
he felt him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to take care
of her fortune; and from this day he
began to ruminate on a &s;cheme which
was afterwards con&s;ummated in her
favour&mdash;In the mean time, he laid
injunctions on Mr. Clarke to conduct
his addre&s;&s;es to Mrs. Cow&s;lip, accord|ing
to the rules of honour and de|corum,
as he valued his countenance
and friend&s;hip. His next &s;tep was to
procure a &s;addle-hor&s;e for Dolly, who
preferred this to any other &s;ort of
carriage; and thereby gratified the wi&s;h
of her admirer, who longed to &s;ee
her on hor&s;eback in her green jo&s;eph.</P>
<P>The armour, including the accou|trements
of the novice and the &s;quire,
were left in the care of the inn-keeper,
<PB N="152" REF="155">
and Timothy Crab&s;haw was &s;o meta|morpho&s;ed
by a plain livery-frock,
that even Gilbert with difficulty re|cognized
his per&s;on. As for the no|vice
Crowe, his head had almo&s;t re|&s;umed
its natural dimen&s;ions; but
then his whole face was &s;o covered
with a livid &s;uffu&s;ion; his no&s;e ap|peared
&s;o flat, and his lips &s;o tumified,
that he might very well have pa&s;&s;ed
for a Caffre or Aethiopian. Every
circum&s;tance being now adju&s;ted,
they departed from Bugden in a re|gular
cavalcade, dined at Hatfield,
and in the evening arrived at the Bull
and Gate inn in Holborn, where
they e&s;tabli&s;hed their quarters for the
night.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which our Hero de&s;cends into the
Man&s;ions of the Damned.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;tep which Sir Launce|lot
took in the morning that
&s;ucceeded his arrival in London, was
to &s;ettle Mrs. Dolly Cow&s;lip in lodg|ings
at the hou&s;e where John Clump
had promi&s;ed to vi&s;it her; as he did
not doubt, that tho' the vi&s;it was de|layed,
it would &s;ome time or other
be performed; and in that ca&s;e, he
might obtain &s;ome intelligence of Au|relia.
Mr. Thomas Clarke was per|mitted
to take up his habitation in the
&s;ame hou&s;e, on his earne&s;tly de&s;iring
he might be intru&s;ted with the office
of conveying information and in&s;truc|tion
between Dolly and our adven|turer.
The knight him&s;elf re&s;olved
to live retired until he &s;hould receive
&s;ome tidings relating to Mi&s;s Darnel,
that would influence his conduct; but
he propo&s;ed to frequent places of pub|lic
re&s;ort incognito, that he might
<PB N="154" REF="157">
have &s;ome chance of meeting by ac|cident
with the mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart.
Taking it for granted that the oddities
of Crowe would help to amu&s;e him
in his hours of &s;olitude and di&s;appoint|ment,
he invited that original to be
his gue&s;t at a &s;mall hou&s;e which he
determined to hire ready furni&s;hed in
the neighbourhood of Golden-&s;quare.
The captain thanked him for his cour|te&s;y,
and frankly embraced his offer;
tho' he did not much approve of the
knight's choice, in point of &s;ituation.
He &s;aid he would recommend him to
a &s;pecial good upper-deck hard by St.
Catherine's in Wapping, where he
would be delighted with the pro&s;pect
of the &s;treet forwards, well frequented
by pa&s;&s;engers, carts, drays, and other
carriages; and having backwards, an
agreeable view of alderman Par&s;ons'
great brewhou&s;e, with two hundred
hogs feeding almo&s;t under the win|dow.
As a further inducement, he
mentioned the vicinity of the Tower
guns, which would regale his hearing
on days of &s;alutation: nor did he for|get

get the &s;weet &s;ound of mooring and
unmooring &s;hips in the river, and the
plea&s;ing objects on the other &s;ide of
the Thames, di&s;played in the oozy
docks and cabbage-gardens of Ro|therhithe.
Sir Launcelot was not in|&s;en&s;ible
to the beauties of this land|&s;cape;
but, his pur&s;uit lying another
way, he contented him&s;elf with a
le&s;s enchanting &s;ituation, and Crowe
accompanied him out of pure friend|&s;hip.
At night Mr. Clarke arrived
at our hero's hou&s;e with tidings that
were by no means agreeable. He
told him that Clump had left a letter
for Dolly, informing her that his ma|&s;ter
'&s;quire Darnel was to &s;et out early
in the morning for York&s;hire; but he
could give no account of her lady,
who had, the day before, been con|veyed,
he knew not whither, in a
hackney-coach, attended by his uncle
and an ill-looking fellow, who had
much the appearance of a bailiff or
turnkey; &s;o that he feared &s;he was
in trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="159">
Sir Launcelot was deeply affected
by this intimation. His apprehen&s;ion
was even rou&s;ed by a &s;u&s;picion that a
man of Darnel's violent temper, and
unprincipled heart, might have prac|ti&s;ed
upon the life of his lovely niece:
but, upon recollection, he could not
&s;uppo&s;e that he had recour&s;e to &s;uch
infamous expedients, knowing, as he
did, that an account of her would
be demanded at his hands, and that
it would be ea&s;ily proved he had con|veyed
her from the lodging in which
&s;he re&s;ided. His fir&s;t fears now gave
way to another &s;ugge&s;tion, that An|thony,
in order to intimidate her into
a compliance with his propo&s;als, had
trumped up a &s;purious claim again&s;t
her, and by virtue of a writ confined
her in &s;ome pri&s;on or &s;punging-hou&s;e.
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this idea, he de&s;ired
Mr. Clarke to &s;earch the &s;heriff's office
in the morning, that he might know
whether any &s;uch writ had been
granted; and he him&s;elf re&s;olved to
make a tour of the great pri&s;ons be|longing
to the metropolis, to enquire
<PB N="157" REF="160">
if perchance &s;he might not be con|fined
under a borrowed name. Fi|nally,
he determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to
appri&s;e her of his place of abode by
a paragraph in all the daily papers,
&s;ignifying that Sir Launcelot Greaves
had arrived at his hou&s;e by Golden-&s;quare.</P>
<P>All the&s;e re&s;olutions were punctual|ly
executed. No &s;uch writ had been
taken out in the &s;heriff's office; and
therefore, our hero &s;et out on his
jail expedition, accompanied by Mr.
Clarke, who had contracted &s;ome ac|quaintance
with the commanding offi|cers
in the&s;e garri&s;ons, in the cour&s;e
of his clerk&s;hip, and practice as an
attorney. The fir&s;t day they &s;pent in
pro&s;ecuting their inquiry through the
Gate-hou&s;e, Fleet, and Mar&s;hal&s;ea;
the next they allotted to the King's|bench,
where they under&s;tood there
was a great variety of pri&s;oners.
There they propo&s;ed to make a mi|nute
&s;crutiny, by the help of Mr.
Norton the deputy-mar&s;hal, who was
Mr. Clarke's intimate friend, and had
<PB N="158" REF="161">
nothing at all of jailor either in his
appearance or in his di&s;po&s;ition, which
was remarkably humane and bene|volent
towards all his fellow-crea|tures.</P>
<P>The knight having be&s;poke dinner
at a tavern in the Borough, was, to|gether
with captain Crowe, conduct|ed
to the pri&s;on of the King's-bench,
which is &s;ituated in St. George's-fields,
about a mile from the end of
We&s;tmin&s;ter-bridge, and appears like
a neat little regular town, con&s;i&s;ting
of one &s;treet, &s;urrounded by a very
high wall, including an open piece of
ground which may be termed a gar|den,
where the pri&s;oners take the air,
and amu&s;e them&s;elves with a variety
of diver&s;ions. Except the entrance,
where the turnkeys keep watch and
ward, there is nothing in the place
that looks like a jail, or bears the lea&s;t
colour of re&s;traint. The &s;treet is
crowded with pa&s;&s;engers. Trade&s;men
of all kinds here exerci&s;e their dif|ferent
profe&s;&s;ions. Hawkers of all
&s;orts are admitted to call and vend
<PB N="159" REF="162">
their wares as in any open &s;treet of
London. Here are butchers-&s;tands,
chandlers-&s;hops, a &s;urgery, a tap|hou&s;e
well frequented, and a public
kitchen in which provi&s;ions are dre&s;&s;ed
for all the pri&s;oners gratis, at the ex|pence
of the publican. Here the
voice of mi&s;ery never complains, and,
indeed, little el&s;e is to be heard but
the &s;ounds of mirth and jollity. At
the farther end of the &s;treet, on the
right hand, is a little paved court lead|ing
to a &s;eparate building, con&s;i&s;ting
of twelve large apartments, called
&s;tate-rooms, well furni&s;hed, and fit|ted
up for the reception of the better
&s;ort of crown-pri&s;oners; and on the
other &s;ide of the &s;treet, facing a &s;e|parate
divi&s;ion of ground, called the
common &s;ide, is a range of rooms
occupied by pri&s;oners of the lowe&s;t
order, who &s;hare the profits of a beg|ging-box,
and are maintained by this
practice, and &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hed funds
of charity. We ought al&s;o to ob|&s;erve,
that the jail is provided with a
neat chapel, in which a clergyman,
<PB N="160" REF="163">
in con&s;ideration of a certain &s;alary,
performs divine &s;ervice every Sun|day.</P>
<P>Our adventurer having &s;earched the
books, and peru&s;ed the de&s;cription of
all the female pri&s;oners who had been
for &s;ome weeks admitted into the jail,
obtained not the lea&s;t intelligence of
his concealed charmer, but re&s;olved
to alleviate his di&s;appointment by the
gratification of his curio&s;ity. Under
the au&s;pices of Mr. Norton, he made
a tour of the pri&s;on, and in particular
vi&s;ited the kitchen, where he &s;aw a
number of &s;pits loaded with a variety
of provi&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of butcher's
meat, poultry, and game: he could
not help expre&s;&s;ing his a&s;toni&s;hment
with up-lifted hands, and congratu|lating
him&s;elf in &s;ecret, upon his be|ing
a member of that community
which had provided &s;uch a comfort|able
a&s;ylum for the unfortunate. His
ejaculation was interrupted by a tu|multuous
noi&s;e in the &s;treet; and Mr.
Norton declaring he was &s;ent for to
the lodge, con&s;igned our hero to the
<PB N="161" REF="164">
care of one Mr. Felton, a pri&s;oner of
a very decent appearance, who paid
his compliments with a good grace,
and invited the company to repo&s;e
them&s;elves in his apartment, which
was large, commodious, and well
furni&s;hed. When Sir Launcelot a&s;k|ed
the cau&s;e of that uproar, he told
him that it was the prelude to a box|ing-match
between two of the pri|&s;oners,
to be decided in the ground,
or garden of the place.</P>
<P>Capt. Crowe expre&s;&s;ing an eager
curio&s;ity to &s;ee the battle, Mr. Fel|ton
a&s;&s;ured him there would be no
&s;port, as the combatants were both
reckoned dunghills: &startq;But, in half
an hour (&s;aid he) there will be a bat|tle
of &s;ome con&s;equence between two
of the demagogues of the place, Dr.
Crabclaw and Mr. Tapley, the fir&s;t
a phy&s;ician, and the other a brewer.
You mu&s;t know, Gentlemen, that
this microco&s;m or republic in minia|ture,
is like the great world, &s;plit in|to
&s;actions. Crabclaw is the leader of
one party; and the other is headed
<PB N="162" REF="165">
by Tapley: both are men of warm
and impetuous tempers; and their
intrigues have embroiled the whole
place, in&s;omuch that it was dange|rous
to walk the &s;treet, on account
of the continual &s;kirmi&s;hes of their
partizans. At length, &s;ome of the
more &s;edate inhabitants having met
and deliberated upon &s;ome remedy
for the&s;e growing di&s;orders, propo&s;ed
that the di&s;pute &s;hould be at once de|cided
by &s;ingle combat between the
two chiefs, who readily agreed to the
propo&s;al. The match was according|ly
made for five guineas, and this very
day and hour appointed for the trial,
on which con&s;iderable &s;ums of money
are depending. As for Mr. Norton,
it is not proper that he &s;hould be pre|&s;ent,
or &s;eem to countenance &s;uch vio|lent
proceedings, which, however, it
is nece&s;&s;ary to connive at, as conve|nient
vents for the evaporation of
tho&s;e humours, which being confined,
might accumulate and break out with
greater fury, in con&s;piracy and re|bellion.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="166">
The knight owned he could not
conceive by what means &s;uch a num|ber
of licentious people, amounting,
with their dependants, to above five
hundred, were re&s;trained within the
bounds of any tolerable di&s;cipline, or
prevented from making their e&s;cape;
which they might at any time accom|pli&s;h,
either by &s;tealth or open vio|lence,
as it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed
that one or two turnkeys, continually
employed in opening and &s;hutting the
door, could re&s;i&s;t the efforts of a
whole multitude. &startq;Your wonder,
good Sir, (&s;aid Mr. Felton) will va|ni&s;h,
when you con&s;ider it is hardly
po&s;&s;ible that the multitude &s;hould co|operate
in the execution of &s;uch a
&s;cheme; and that the keeper perfectly
well under&s;tands the maxim <HI>divide et
impera.</HI> Many pri&s;oners are re&s;trained
by the dictates of gratitude towards
the deputy-mar&s;hal, who&s;e friend&s;hip
and good offices they have experi|enced:
&s;ome, no doubt, are actuated
by motives of di&s;cretion. One party
is an effectual check upon the other;
<PB N="164" REF="167">
and I am firmly per&s;uaded that there
are not ten pri&s;oners within the place
that would make their e&s;cape, if the
doors were laid open. This is a &s;tep
which no man would take, unle&s;s
his fortune was altogether de&s;perate;
becau&s;e it would oblige him to leave
his country for life, and expo&s;e him
to the mo&s;t imminent ri&s;que of being
retaken and treated with the utmo&s;t
&s;everity. The majority of the pri&s;o|ners
live in the mo&s;t lively hope of
being relea&s;ed by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
their friends, the compa&s;&s;ion of their
creditors, or the favour of the legi|&s;lature.
Some who are cut off from all
the&s;e propo&s;als, are become naturalized
to the place, knowing they cannot
&s;ub&s;i&s;t in any other &s;ituation. I, my|&s;elf,
am one of the&s;e. After having
re&s;igned all my effects for the benefit
of my creditors, I have been detained
the&s;e nine years in pri&s;on, becau&s;e
one per&s;on refu&s;es to &s;ign my certifi|cate.
I have long outlived all my
friends from whom I could expect the
lea&s;t countenance or favour: I am
<PB N="165" REF="168">
grown old in confinement; and lay
my account with ending my days in
jail, as the mercy of the legi&s;lature in
favour of in&s;olvent debtors, is never
extended to uncertified bankrupts
taken in execution. By dint of in|du&s;try,
and the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy,
I make &s;hift to live independant in
this retreat. To this &s;cene my facul|ty
of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, as well as my body,
is peculiarly confined. Had I an op|portunity
to e&s;cape, where &s;hould I
go? All my views of fortune have
been long bla&s;ted. I have no friends
nor connexions in the world. I mu&s;t,
therefore, &s;tarve in &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered
corner, or be recaptivated and confin|ed
for ever to clo&s;e pri&s;on, deprived
of the indulgences which I now en|joy.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the conver&s;ation was broke
off by another uproar, which was the
&s;ignal to battle between the doctor and
his antagoni&s;t. The company imme|diately
adjourned to the field, where
the combatants were already undre&s;&s;ed
and the &s;takes depo&s;ited. The doc|tor
<PB N="166" REF="169">
&s;eemed of the middle age and mid|dle
&s;tature, active and alert, with an
atrabilarious a&s;pect, and a mixture
of rage and di&s;dain expre&s;&s;ed in his
countenance. The brewer was large,
raw-boned, and round as a but of
beer, but very fat, unwieldy, &s;hort|winded
and phlegmatic. Our adven|turer
was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed when
he beheld in the character of &s;econds,
a male and a female &s;tripped naked
from the wai&s;t upwards, the latter
ranging on the &s;ide of the phy&s;ician:
but the commencement of the bat|tle
prevented his demanding of his
guide an explanation of this phoeno|menon.
The doctor, retiring &s;ome
paces backwards, threw him&s;elf into
the attitude of a battering ram, and
ru&s;hed upon his antagoni&s;t with great
impetuo&s;ity, fore&s;eeing that &s;hould he
have the good fortune to over-turn
him in the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault, it would not
be an ea&s;y ta&s;k to rai&s;e him up again
and put him in a capacity of offence.
But the momentum of Crabclaw's
head, and the concomitant efforts of
<PB N="167" REF="170">
his knuckles, had no effect upon the
ribs of Tapley, who &s;tood firm as
the Acroceraunian promontory: and
&s;lepping forward with his projected
fi&s;t, &s;omething &s;maller and &s;ofter than
a &s;ledge-hammer, &s;truck the phy&s;ician
to the ground. In a trice, however,
by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his female &s;econd,
he was on his legs again, and grap|pling
with his antagoni&s;t, endeavour|ed
to tip him a fall; but, in&s;tead of
accompli&s;hing his purpo&s;e, he re|ceived
a cro&s;s-buttock, and the brewer
throwing him&s;elf upon him as he fell,
had well-nigh &s;mothered him on the
&s;pot. The amazon flew to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
and Tapley &s;hewing no incli|nation
to get up, &s;he &s;mote him on
the temple 'till he roared. The male
&s;econd ha&s;tening to the relief of his
principal, made application to the
eyes of the female, which were
immediately &s;urrounded with black
circles; and &s;he returned the &s;alute
with a blow which brought a double
&s;tream of blood from his no&s;trils,
greeting him at the &s;ame time with
<PB N="168" REF="171">
the opprobrious appellation of a lou|&s;y
&s;on of a b&mdash;h. A combat more fu|rious
than the fir&s;t would now have
en&s;ued, had not Felton interpo&s;ed
with an air of authority, and in&s;i&s;|ted
on the man's leaving the field;
an injunction which he forthwith
obeyed, &s;aying, &startq;Well, damme,
Felton, you're my friend and com|mander:
I'll obey your order&mdash;but
the b&mdash;h will be foul of me before
we &s;leep.&mdash;&endq; Then Felton, advanc|ing
to his opponent, &startq;Madam, (&s;aid
he) I'm very &s;orry to &s;ee a lady of
your rank and qualifications expo&s;e
your&s;elf in this manner.&mdash;For God's
&s;ake, behave with a little more de|corum;
if not for the &s;ake of your
own family, at lea&s;t for the credit of
your &s;ex in general.&endq; &startq;Hark ye,
Felton, (&s;aid &s;he) decorum is founded
upon a delicacy of &s;entiment and de|portment,
which cannot con&s;i&s;t with
the di&s;graces of a jail, and the mi&s;e|ries
of indigence.&mdash;But I &s;ee the di&s;|pute
is now terminated, and the mo|ney
is to be drank: if you'll dine
<PB N="169" REF="172">
with us you &s;hall be welcome: if not,
you may die in your &s;obriety, and be
damned.&endq;</P>
<P>By this time the doctor had given
out, and allowed the brewer to be the
better man; yet he would not honour
the fe&s;tival with his pre&s;ence, but re|tired
to his chamber, exceedingly
mortified at his defeat. Our hero
was reconducted to Mr. Felton's
apartment, where he &s;at &s;ome time
without opening his mouth, &s;o a&s;to|ni&s;hed
he was at what he had &s;een
and heard. &startq;I perceive, Sir, (&s;aid
the pri&s;oner) you are &s;urpri&s;ed at the
manner in which I acco&s;ted that un|happy
woman; and perhaps you
will be more &s;urpri&s;ed when you
hear, that within the&s;e eighteen
months, &s;he was actually a per&s;on of
fa&s;hion, and her opponent (who by
the bye) is her hu&s;band, univer&s;ally
re&s;pected as a man of honour, and a
brave officer.&endq; &startq;I am, indeed, (cried
our hero) overwhelmed with amaze|ment
and concern, as well as &s;timu|lated
by an eager curio&s;ity to know
<PB N="170" REF="173">
the fatal cau&s;es which have produced
&s;uch a deplorable rever&s;e of character
and fortune. But I will rein my
curio&s;ity till the afternoon, if you
will favour me with your company at
a tavern in the neighbourhood, where
I have be&s;poke dinner; a favour which
I hope Mr. Norton will have no ob|jection
to your granting, as he him|&s;elf
is to be of the party.&endq;&mdash;The
pri&s;oner thanked him for his kind in|vitation,
and they adjourned imme|diately
to the place, taking up the de|puty-mar&s;hal
in their pa&s;&s;age through
the lodge or entrance of the pri&s;on.</P>

<P>DInner being chearfully di&s;cu&s;|&s;ed,
and our adventurer ex|pre&s;&s;ing
an eager de&s;ire to know the
hi&s;tory of the male and female who
had acted as '&s;quires or &s;econds to the
champions of the King's-bench, Fel|ton
gratified his curio&s;ity to this effect:</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="174">
&startq;All that I know of Captain Clew|lin,
previous to his commitment, is,
that he was commander of a &s;loop of
war, and bore the reputation of a
gallant officer; that he married the
daughter of a rich merchant in the
city of London again&s;t the inclina|tion,
and without the knowledge of
her father, who renounced her for
this act of di&s;obedience: that the cap|tain
con&s;oled him&s;elf for the rigour
of the parent with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the lady, who was not only remark|ably
beautiful in per&s;on, but highly
accompli&s;hed in her mind, and ami|able
in her di&s;po&s;ition. Such, a few
months ago, were tho&s;e two per&s;ons
whom you &s;aw acting in &s;uch a vulgar
capacity. When they fir&s;t entered
the pri&s;on they were undoubtedly the
hand&s;ome&s;t couple mine eyes ever be|held,
and their appearance won uni|ver&s;al
re&s;pect even from the mo&s;t bru|tal
inhabitants of the jail. The cap|tain
having unwarily involved him&s;elf
as &s;ecurity for a man to whom he
had lain under obligations, became
<PB N="172" REF="175">
liable for a con&s;iderable &s;um; and
his own father-in-law being the &s;ole
creditor of the bankrupt, took this
opportunity of wreaking vengeance
upon him for having e&s;pou&s;ed his
daughter. He watched an opportu|nity
until the captain had actually &s;tept
into the po&s;t-chai&s;e with his lady for
Port&s;mouth, where his &s;hip lay, and
cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted in the mo&s;t
public and &s;hameful manner. Mrs.
Clewlin had like to have &s;unk under
the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of her grief and
mortification; but the&s;e &s;ub&s;iding, &s;he
had recour&s;e to per&s;onal &s;ollicitation.
She went with her only child in her
arms (a lovely boy) to her father's
door, and being denied admittance,
kneeled down in the &s;treet, imploring
his compa&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t pathetic
&s;train; but this hard-hearted citizen,
in&s;tead of recognizing his child, and
taking the poor mourner to his bo&s;om,
in&s;ulted her from the window with
the mo&s;t bitter reproach, &s;aying, a|mong
other &s;hocking expre&s;&s;ions,
&startq;Strumpet, take your&s;elf away, with
<PB N="173" REF="176">
your brat, otherwi&s;e I &s;hall &s;end for
the beadle, and have you to Bride|well.&endq;</P>
<P>The unfortunate lady was cut to
the heart by this u&s;age, and &s;ainted
in the &s;treet; from whence &s;he was
conveyed to a public hou&s;e by the
charity of &s;ome pa&s;&s;engers. She af|terwards
attempted to &s;often the bar|barity
of her father, by repeated let|ters,
and by intere&s;ting &s;ome of his
friends to intercede with him in her
behalf; but all her endeavours prov|ing
ineffectual, &s;he accompanied her
hu&s;band to the pri&s;on of the King's-bench,
where &s;he mu&s;t have felt, in
the &s;evere&s;t manner, the fatal rever&s;e
of circum&s;tance to which &s;he was ex|po&s;ed.
The captain being di&s;abled
from going to &s;ea, was &s;uper&s;eded,
and he &s;aw all his hopes bla&s;ted in the
mid&s;t of an active war, at a time
when he had the faire&s;t pro&s;pects of
fame and fortune. He &s;aw him&s;elf
reduced to extreme poverty, cooped
up with the tender partner of his heart
in a wretched hovel, amid&s;t the re|fu&s;e
<PB N="174" REF="177">
of mankind, and on the brink of
wanting the common nece&s;&s;aries of
life. The mind of man is ever inge|nious
in finding re&s;ources. He com|forted
his lady with vain hopes of
having friends who would effect his
deliverance, and repeated a&s;&s;urances of
this kind &s;o long, that he at length
began to think they were not altoge|ther
void of foundation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Clewlin, from a principle of
duty, recollected all her fortitude,
that &s;he might not only bear her fate
with patience, but even contributed
to alleviate the woes of her hu&s;band,
whom her affection had ruined. She
affected to believe the &s;ugge&s;tions of
his pretended hope; &s;he interchanged
with him a&s;&s;urances of better fortune;
her appearance exhibited a calm,
while her heart was torn with angui&s;h.
She a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in writing letters to
former friends, the la&s;t con&s;olation of
the wretched pri&s;oner; &s;he delivered
the&s;e letters with her own hand, and
underwent a thou&s;and mortifying re|pul&s;es,
the mo&s;t &s;hocking circum&s;tan|ces
<PB N="175" REF="178">
of which &s;he concealed from her
hu&s;band. She performed all the me|nial
offices in her own little family,
which was maintained by pawning
her apparel; and both the hu&s;band
and wife, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;weetened
their cares, by prattling and toying
with their charming little boy, on
whom they doated with an enthu&s;ia&s;m
of fondne&s;s.&mdash;Yet even this plea|&s;ure
was mingled with the mo&s;t ten|der
and melancholy regret. I have
&s;een the mother hang over him, with
the mo&s;t affecting expre&s;&s;ion of this
kind in her a&s;pect, the tears contend|ing
with the &s;miles upon her counte|nance,
while &s;he exclaimed: Alas!
my poor pri&s;oner, little did your mo|ther
once think &s;he &s;hould be obliged
to nur&s;e you in a jail.&endq; The captains
paternal love was da&s;hed with impa|tience&mdash;He
would &s;natch up the boy
in a tran&s;port of grief, pre&s;s him to
his brea&s;t, devour him as it were with
ki&s;&s;es, throw up his eyes to heaven in
the mo&s;t emphatic &s;ilence; then con|vey
the child ha&s;tily to his mother's
<PB N="176" REF="179">
arms, pull his hat over his eyes, &s;talk
out into the common walk, and finding
him&s;elf alone, break out into tears and
lamentation.</P>
<P>Ah! little did this unhappy couple
know what further griefs awaited
them! The &s;mall-pox broke out in
the pri&s;on, and poor Tommy Clewlin
was infected. As the eruption appeared
unfavourable, you may con|ceive
the con&s;ternation with which
they were overwhelmed. Their di&s;|tre&s;s
was rendered inconceiveable by
indigence; for, by this time, they
were &s;o de&s;titute that they could nei|ther
pay for common attendance, nor
procure proper advice. I did on that
occa&s;ion, what I thought my duty to|wards
my fellow-creatures.&mdash;I wrote
to a phy&s;ician of my acquaintance,
who was humane enough to vi&s;it the
poor little patient: I engaged a care|ful
woman-pri&s;oner as a nur&s;e, and
Mr. Norton &s;upplied them with mo|ney
and nece&s;&s;aries. The&s;e helps
were barely &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve them
from the horrors of de&s;pair, when they
<PB N="177" REF="180">
&s;aw their little darling panting under
the rage of a loath&s;ome pe&s;tilential
malady, during the exce&s;&s;ive heat of
the dog-days, and &s;truggling for breath
in the noxious atmo&s;phere of a con|fined
cabin, where they &s;carce had
room to turn, on the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary
occa&s;ions. The eager curio&s;ity with
which the mother eyed the doctor's
looks as often as he vi&s;ited the boy;
the terror and trepidation of the fa|ther,
while he de&s;ired to know his
opinion; in a word, the whole tenour
of their di&s;tre&s;s baffled all de&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P>At length, the phy&s;ician, for the
&s;ake of his own character, was obliged
to be explicit; and returning with the
captain to the common walk, told
him, in my hearing, that the child
could not po&s;&s;ibly recover.&mdash;This &s;en|tence
&s;eemed to have petrified the un|fortunate
parent, who &s;tood motion|le&s;s,
and &s;eemingly bereft of &s;en&s;e. I
led him to my apartment, where he
&s;at a full hour in that &s;tate of &s;tupe|faction;
then he began to groan
<PB N="178" REF="181">
hideou&s;ly; a &s;hower of tears bur&s;t
from his eyes; he threw him&s;elf on
the floor, and uttered the mo&s;t piteous
lamentation that ever was heard.
Mean while, Mrs. Norton being made
aquainted with the doctor's progno&s;|tic,
vi&s;ited Mrs. Clewlin, and invited
her to the lodge. Her prophetic fears
immediately took the alarm. &startq;What!
(cried &s;he, &s;tarting up with a frantic
wildne&s;s in her looks) then our ca&s;e is
de&s;perate&mdash;I &s;hall lo&s;e my dear Tom|my!&mdash;the
poor pri&s;oner will be re|lea&s;ed
by the hand of heaven!&mdash;Death
will convey him to the cold grave!&endq;&mdash;The
dying innocent hearing this ex|clamation,
pronounced the&s;e words:
&startq;Tommy won't leave you, my dear
mamma&mdash;if death comes to take
Tommy, papa &s;hall drive him away
with his &s;word.&endq; This addre&s;s de|prived
the wretched mother of all re|&s;ignation
to the will of Providence.
She tore her hair, da&s;hed her&s;elf on
the pavement, &s;hrieked aloud, and was
carried off in a deplorable &s;tate of di&s;|traction.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="182">
That &s;ame evening the lovely babe
expired, and the father grew frantic.
He made an attempt on his own life;
and being with difficulty re&s;trained,
his agitation &s;unk into a kind of &s;ud|den
in&s;en&s;ibility, which &s;eemed to ab|&s;orb
all &s;entiment, and gradually vul|garized
his faculty of thinking. In
order to di&s;&s;ipate the violence of his
&s;orrow, he continually &s;hifted the
&s;cene from one company to another,
contracted abundance of low con|nexions,
and drowned his cares in re|peated
intoxication. The unhappy lady
underwent a long &s;cries of hy&s;terical
fits and other complaints, which &s;eem|ed
to have a fatal effect on her brain
as well as con&s;titution. Cordials were
admini&s;tred to keep up her &s;pirits; and
&s;he found it nece&s;&s;ary to protract the
u&s;e of them to blunt the edge of grief,
by overwhelming reflexion, and re|move
the &s;en&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;ing
from a di&s;order in her &s;tomach. In
a word, &s;he became an habitual dram|drinker;
and this practice expo&s;ed her
to &s;uch communication as debatched
<PB N="180" REF="183">
her rea&s;on, and perverted her &s;en&s;e of
decorum and propriety. She and her
hu&s;band gave a loo&s;e to vulgar exce&s;s,
in which they were enabled to indulge
by the charity and intere&s;t of &s;ome
friends, who obtained half-pay for the
captain. They are now metamor|pho&s;ed
into the &s;hocking creatures you
have &s;een; he into a riotous plebeian,
and &s;he into a ragged trull. They are
both drunk every day, quarrel and
fight one with another, and often in|&s;ult
their fellow-pri&s;oners. Yet they
are not wholly abandoned by virtue
and humanity. The captain is &s;cru|pulou&s;ly
hone&s;t in all his dealings,
and pays off his debts punctually every
quarter, as &s;oon as he receives his
half-pay. Every pri&s;oner in di&s;tre&s;s
is welcome to &s;hare his money while
it la&s;ts; and his wife never fails,
while it is in her power, to relieve
the wretched; &s;o that their genero&s;i|ty,
even in this mi&s;erable di&s;gui&s;e, is
univer&s;ally re&s;pected by their neigh|bours.
Sometimes the recollection of
their former rank comes over them
<PB N="181" REF="184">
like a qualm, which they di&s;pel with
brandy, and then humorou&s;ly rally
one another on their mutual degene|racy.
She often &s;tops me in the walk,
and, pointing to the captain, &s;ays,
&startq;My hu&s;band, tho' he is become a
black-guard jail-bird, mu&s;t be allow|ed
to be an hand&s;ome fellow &s;till.&endq;&mdash;On
the other hand, he will frequent|ly
de&s;ire me to take notice of his rib,
as &s;he chances to pa&s;s.&mdash;&startq;Mind that
draggle-tail'd drunken drab&mdash;(he will
&s;ay) what an antidote it is&mdash;yet, for
all that, Felton, &s;he was a fine woman
when I married her&mdash;Poor Be&s;s, I
have been the ruin of her, that is
certain, and de&s;erve to be damned for
bringing her to this pa&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>Thus they accommodate them|&s;elves
to each other's infirmities, and
pa&s;s their time not without &s;ome ta&s;te
of plebeian enjoyment&mdash;but, name
their child, they never fail to bur&s;t
into tears, and &s;till feel a return of the
mo&s;t poignant &s;orrow.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot Greaves did not hear
this &s;tory unmoved. Tom Clark's
<PB N="182" REF="185">
cheeks were bedewed with the drops
of &s;ympathy, while with much &s;ob|bing,
he declared his opinion, that an
action would lie again&s;t the lady's fa|ther.&mdash;Captain
Crowe having li&s;tened
to the &s;tory, with uncommon atten|tion,
expre&s;&s;ed his concern that an
hone&s;t &s;eaman &s;hould be &s;o taken in
&s;tays: but he imputed all his calami|ties
to the wife: &startq;For why? (&s;aid he)
a &s;ea-&s;aring man may have a &s;weet|heart
in every port; but he &s;hould
&s;teer clear of a wife, as he would
avoid a quick-&s;and.&mdash;You &s;ee, brother,
how this here Clewlin lags a&s;tern in
the wake of a &s;niveling b&mdash;; other|wi&s;e
he would never make a weft in
his en&s;ign for the lo&s;s of a child&mdash;odds
heart! he could have done no
more if he had &s;prung a top-ma&s;t, or
&s;tarted a timber.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>The knight declaring that he would
take another view of the pri&s;on in the
afternoon, Mr. Felton in&s;i&s;ted upon
his doing him the honour to drink a
di&s;h of tea in his apartment, and Sir
Launcelot accepted his invitation.
<PB N="183" REF="186">
Thither they accordingly repaired, af|ter
having made another circuit of the
jail, and the tea-things were produced
by Mrs. Felton, when &s;he was &s;um|moned
to the door, and in a few mi|nutes
returning, communicated &s;ome|thing
in a whi&s;per to her hu&s;band.
He changed colour, and repaired to
the &s;tair-ca&s;e, where he was heard to
talk aloud in an angry tone. When
he came back he told the company he
had been teazed by a very importunate
beggar. Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to our
adventurer, &startq;You took notice (&s;ays
he) of a fine lady flaunting about our
walk in all the frippery of the fa&s;hion.
&mdash;She was lately a gay young widow
that made a great figure at the court
end of the town; &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed
her&s;elf by her &s;plendid equipage, her
rich liveries, her brilliant a&s;&s;emblies,
her numerous routs, and her elegant
ta&s;te in dre&s;s and furniture. She is
nearly related to &s;ome of the be&s;t fami|lies
in England, and, it mu&s;t be own|ed,
mi&s;tre&s;s of many fine accompli&s;h|ments.
<PB N="184" REF="187">
But being deficient in true
delicacy, &s;he endeavoured to hide that
defect by affectation. She pretended
to a thou&s;and antipathies which did
not belong to her nature. A brea&s;t of
veal threw her into mortal agonies. If
&s;he &s;aw a &s;pider &s;he &s;creamed; and at
&s;ight of a mou&s;e &s;he fainted away.
She could not without horror behold
an entire joint of meat; and nothing
but frica&s;&s;ees and other made-di&s;hes
were &s;een upon her table. She cau|&s;ed
all her floors to be lined with green
bays, that &s;he might trip along them
with more ea&s;e and plea&s;ure. Her
footmen wore clogs, which were de|po&s;ited
in the hall, and both they and
her chairmen were laid under the
&s;tronge&s;t injunctions to avoid porter
and tobacco. Her jointure amounted
to eight hundred pounds per annum,
and &s;he made &s;hift to &s;pend four times
that &s;um: at lenght it was mortgaged
for nearly the entire value; but, far
from retrenching, &s;he &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e
in extravagance until her effects
were taken in execution, and her per|&s;on
<PB N="185" REF="188">
here depo&s;ited in &s;afe cu&s;tody.
When one con&s;iders the abrupt tran&s;i|tion
&s;he underwent from her &s;pacious
apartments to an hovel &s;carce eight
feet &s;quare; from &s;umptuous furni|ture
to bare benches; from magnifi|cence
to meanne&s;s; from affluence to
extreme poverty; one would imagine
&s;he mu&s;t have been totally over|whelmed
by &s;uch a &s;udden gu&s;h of
mi&s;ery. But this was not the ca&s;e:
&s;he has, in fact, no delicate feelings.
She forthwith accommodated her&s;elf
to the exigency of her fortune; yet
&s;he &s;till affects to keep &s;tate amid&s;t the
mi&s;eries of a goal; and this affecta|tion
is truly ridiculous.&mdash;She lies a-bed
till two o'clock in the afternoon: &s;he
maintains a female attendant for the
&s;ole purpo&s;e of dre&s;&s;ing her per&s;on.
Her cabin is the lea&s;t cleanly in the
whole pri&s;on; &s;he has learned to eat
bread and chee&s;e, and drink porter;
but &s;he always appears once a day
dre&s;&s;ed in the pink of the fa&s;hion. She
has found means to run in debt at the
chandler's &s;hop, the baker's, and the
<PB N="186" REF="189">
tap-hou&s;e, tho' there is nothing got
in this place but with ready money:
&s;he has even borrowed &s;mall &s;ums
from divers pri&s;oners, who were them|&s;elves
on the brink of &s;tarving. She
takes plea&s;ure in being &s;urrounded
with duns, ob&s;erving, that by &s;uch peo|ple
a per&s;on of fa&s;hion is to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.
She writes circular letters
to her former friends and acquain|tance,
and by this method has rai&s;ed
pretty con&s;iderable contributions; for
&s;he writes in a mo&s;t elegant and irre|&s;i&s;tible
&s;tile. About a fortnight ago
&s;he received a &s;upply of twenty gui|neas;
when, in&s;tead of paying her
little goal-debts, or withdrawing any
part of her apparel from pawn, &s;he
laid out the whole &s;um in a fa&s;hiona|ble
&s;uit and laces; and next day
borrowed of me a &s;hilling to purcha&s;e
a neck of mutton for her dinner&mdash;She
&s;eems to think her rank in life in|titles
her to this kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
She talks very pompou&s;ly of her fami|ly
and connexions, by whom, howe|ver,
&s;he has been long renounced.
<PB N="187" REF="190">
She has no &s;ympathy nor compa&s;&s;ion
for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of her fellow-crea|tures;
but &s;he is perfectly well bred;
&s;he bears a repul&s;e the be&s;t of any
woman I ever knew; and her temper
has never been once ruffled &s;ince her
arrival at the King's-bench&mdash;She now
intreated me to lend her half a guinea,
for which &s;he &s;aid &s;he had the mo&s;t
pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, and promi&s;ed upon
her honour it &s;hould be repaid to|morrow;
but I lent a deaf ear to her
reque&s;t, and told her in plain terms
that her honour was already bank|rupt.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot thru&s;ting his hand
mechanically into his pocket, pulled
out a couple of guineas, and de&s;ired
Felton to accommodate her with that
trifle in his own name; but he de|clined
the propo&s;al, and refu&s;ed to
touch the money. &startq;God forbid,
(&s;aid he) that I &s;hould attempt to
thwart your charitable intention: but
this, my good &s;ir, is no object&mdash;&s;he
has many re&s;ources. Neither &s;hould
we number the clamorous beggar
<PB N="188" REF="191">
among tho&s;e who really feel di&s;tre&s;s.
He is generally gorged with bounty
mi&s;applied. The liberal hand of cha|rity
&s;hould be extended to mode&s;t want
that pines in &s;ilence, encountering
cold, and nakedne&s;s, and hunger, and
every &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s. Here you
may find the wretch of keen &s;en&s;a|tions,
bla&s;ted by accident in the blo&s;|&s;om
of his fortune, &s;hivering in the
&s;olitary rece&s;s of indigence, di&s;daining
to beg, and even a&s;hamed to let his
mi&s;ery be known. Here you may
&s;ee the parent who has known happier
times, &s;urrounded by his tender off|&s;pring,
naked and forlorn, demand|ing
food, which his circum&s;tances can|not
afford.&mdash;That man of decent ap|pearance
and melancholy a&s;pect, who
lifted his hat as you pa&s;&s;ed him in the
yard, is a per&s;on of unblemi&s;hed cha|racter.
He was a reputable trade&s;man
in the city, and failed through inevi|table
lo&s;&s;es. A commi&s;&s;ion of bank|ruptcy
was taken out again&s;t him by
his &s;ole creditor, a quaker, who re|fu&s;ed
to &s;ign his certificate. He has
<PB N="189" REF="192">
lived the&s;e three years in pri&s;on, with
a wife and five &s;mall children. In a
little time after his commitment, he
had friends who offered to pay ten
&s;hillings in the pound of what he ow|ed,
and to give &s;ecurity for paying the
remainder in three years, by in&s;tall|ments.
The hone&s;t quaker did not
charge the bankrupt with any di&s;ho|ne&s;t
practices; but he rejected the
propo&s;al with the mo&s;t mortifying in|difference,
declaring that he did not
want his money. The mother re|paired
to his hou&s;e, and kneeled be|fore
him with her five lovely children,
imploring mercy with tears and excla|mations.
He &s;tood this &s;cene un|moved,
and even &s;eemed to enjoy the
pro&s;pect, wearing the looks of com|placency
while his heart was &s;teeled
with rancour. &startq;Woman, (&s;aid he)
the&s;e be hopeful babes, if they were
duly nurtured. Go thy ways in peace;
I have taken my re&s;olution.&endq; Her
friends maintained the family for &s;ome
time; but it is not in human charity
to per&s;evere: &s;ome of them died;
<PB N="190" REF="193">
&s;ome of them grew unfortunate; &s;ome
of them fell off; and now the poor
man is reduced to the extremity of in|digence,
from whence he has no pro|&s;pect
of being retrieved. The fourth
part of what you would have be&s;towed
upon the lady would make this poor
man and his family &s;ing with joy.&endq;</P>
<P>He had &s;carce pronounced the&s;e
words when our hero de&s;ired the man
might be called, and in a few minutes
he entered the apartment with a low
obei&s;ance. &startq;Mr. Coleby, (&s;aid the
knight) I have heard how cruelly you
have been u&s;ed by your creditor, and
beg you will accept this trifling pre|&s;ent,
if it can be of any &s;ervice to you
in your di&s;tre&s;s.&endq; So &s;aying, he put
five guineas into his hand. The poor
man was &s;o confounded at &s;uch an
unlooked-for acqui&s;ition, that he &s;tood
motionle&s;s and &s;ilent, unable to thank
the donor; and Mr. Felton conveyed
him to the door, ob&s;erving that his
heart was too full for utterance. But,
in a little time, his wife bur&s;ting into
the room with her five children,
<PB N="191" REF="194">
looked around, and going up to Sir
Launcelot, without any direction, ex|claimed:
&startq;This is the angel &s;ent by
Providence to &s;uccour me and my
poor innocents.&endq; Then falling at his
feet, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed his hand and bathed
it with her tears&mdash;He rai&s;ed her up
with that complacency which was na|tural
to his di&s;po&s;ition. He ki&s;&s;ed all
her children, who were remarkably
hand&s;ome and neatly kept, though in
homely apparel; and, giving her his
direction, a&s;&s;ured her &s;he might always
apply to him in her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>After her departure, he produced a
bank-note for twenty pounds, and
would have depo&s;ited it in the hands
of Mr. Felton, to be di&s;tributed in
charities among the objects of the
place; but he de&s;ired it might be left
with Mr. Norton, who was the pro|per
per&s;on for managing his benevo|lence;
and he promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
deputy with his advice in laying it
out.</P>

<P>THREE whole days had our ad|venturer

&s;ought in every place of public and of

in&s;tantly vani&s;hed, the following bil|let:
&startq;If you would learn the parti|culars

but his eagerne&s;s to retrieve

was already at hand, and neither

found to accompany him, had he
been di&s;po&s;ed to make u&s;e of their at|tendance.
He therefore, after a mo|ment's

<P>Crowe was one of tho&s;e defective
&s;pirits, who cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t for any
length of time on their own bottoms.
He wanted a familiar prop, upon
which he could di&s;burthen his cares,
his doubts, and his humours: an
humble friend who would endure his
caprices, and with whom he could
communicate, free of all re&s;erve and

per&s;on, and admired his parts,
he con&s;idered him often as a little pe|tulant
jackanapes, who pre&s;umed up|on
his &s;uperior under&s;tanding; and as
for Sir Launcelot, there was &s;ome|thing
<PB N="194" REF="197">
in his character that overawed
the &s;eaman, and kept him at a di&s;a|greeable
di&s;tance. He had, in this
dilemma, ca&s;t his eyes upon Timothy
Crab&s;haw, and admitted him to a
con&s;iderable &s;hare of familiarity and
fellow&s;hip. The&s;e companions had
been employed in &s;moaking a &s;ocial
pipe at an alehou&s;e in the neighbour|hood,
when the knight made his ex|cur&s;ion;
and returning to the hou&s;e
about &s;upper-time, found Mr. Clarke
in waiting. The young lawyer was
alarmed when he heard the hour of
ten, without &s;eeing our adventurer,
who had been u&s;ed to be extremely
regular in his oeconomy; and the
captain and he &s;upped in profound
&s;ilence. Finding, upon enquiry among
the &s;ervants, that the knight went out
abruptly, in con&s;equence of having
received a biller, Tom began to be
vi&s;ited with the apprehen&s;ion of a
duel, and &s;at the be&s;t part of the night
by his uncle, &s;weating with the ex|pectation
of &s;eeing our hero brought
home a breathle&s;s cor&s;e: but no tid|ings
<PB N="195" REF="198">
of him arriving, he, about two
in the morning, repaired to his own
lodging, re&s;olved to publi&s;h a de&s;crip|tion
of Sir Launcelot in the news-pa|pers,
if he &s;hould not appear next
day. Crowe did not pa&s;s the time
without unea&s;ine&s;s. He was extreme|ly
concerned at the thought of &s;ome
mi&s;chief having befallen his friend and
patron; and he was terrified with the
apprehen&s;ion, that in ca&s;e Sir Launce|lot
was murdered, his &s;pirit might
come and give him notice of his fate.
Now he had an in&s;uperable aver&s;ion
to all corre&s;pondence with the dead;
and taking it for granted, that the &s;pi|rit
of his departed friend could not ap|pear
to him except when he &s;hould be
alone, and a-bed in the dark, he de|termined
to pa&s;s the remainder of the
night without going to bed. For this
purpo&s;e his fir&s;t care was to vi&s;it the
garret, in which Timothy Crab&s;haw
lay fa&s;t a&s;leep, &s;noring with his mouth
wide open. Him the captain with
difficulty rou&s;ed, by dint of promi&s;ing
to regale him with a bowl of rum
<PB N="196" REF="199">
punch in the kitchen, where the fire,
which had been extingui&s;hed, was
&s;oon rekindled. The ingredients were
fetched from a public-hou&s;e in the
neighbourhood; for the captain was too
proud to u&s;e his intere&s;t in the knight's
family, e&s;pecially at the&s;e hours when
all the re&s;t of the &s;ervants had retir|ed
to their repo&s;e; and he and Timo|thy
drank together until day-break,
the conver&s;ation turning upon hob|goblins,
and God's revenge again&s;t
murder. The cookmaid lay in a little
apartment contiguous to the kitchen;
and whether di&s;turbed by the&s;e hor|rible
tales of apparitions, or titillated
by the &s;avoury &s;teams that i&s;&s;ued from
the punch-bowl, &s;he made a virtue of
nece&s;&s;ity, or appetite, and dre&s;&s;ing her|&s;elf
in the dark, &s;uddenly appeared be|fore
them, to the no &s;mall perturba|tion
of both. Timothy, in particular,
was &s;o &s;tartled, that in his endeavours
to make an ha&s;ty retreat towards the
chimney corner, he overturned the
table; the liquor was &s;pilt, but the
bowl was &s;aved by falling on a heap
<PB N="197" REF="200">
of a&s;hes. Mrs. Cook having repri|manded
him for his fooli&s;h fear, de|clared
&s;he had got up betimes, in or|der
to &s;cour her &s;aucepans; and the
captain propo&s;ed to have the bowl re|pleni&s;hed,
if materials could be pro|cured.
This difficulty was overcome
by Crab&s;haw; and they &s;at down with
their new a&s;&s;ociate to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;e|cond
edition. The knight's &s;udden
di&s;appearing being brought upon the
carpet, their female companion gave
it as her opinion, that nothing would
be &s;o likely to bring this affair to light,
as going to a cunning man, whom &s;he
had lately con&s;ulted about a &s;ilver
&s;poon that was mi&s;laid, and who told
her all the things that &s;he ever did,
and ever would happen to her through
the whole cour&s;e of her life.</P>
<P>Her two companions pricked up
their ears at this intelligence; and
Crowe a&s;ked if the &s;poon had been
found? She an&s;wered in the affirma|tive,
and &s;aid, the cunning man de|&s;cribed
to a hair the per&s;on that &s;hould
be her true love, and her wedded hu&s;|band:
<PB N="198" REF="201">
that he was a &s;ea-faring man;
that he was pretty well &s;tricken in
years; a little pa&s;&s;ionate or &s;o; and
that he went with his fingers clinch|ed
like, as it were. The captain be|gan
to &s;weat at this de&s;cription, and
mechanically thru&s;t his hands into his
pockets, while Crab&s;haw, pointing to
him, told her he believed &s;he had got
the right &s;ow by the ear. Crowe
grumbled, that may hap for all that
he &s;hould not be brought up by &s;uch
a grappling neither. Then he a&s;ked
if this cunning man dealt with the
devil, declaring, in that ca&s;e he would
keep clear of him: for why? becau&s;e
he mu&s;t have &s;old him&s;elf to old
&s;cratch; and being a &s;ervant of the
devil, how could he be a good &s;ub|ject
to his maje&s;ty? Mrs. Cook a&s;&s;ur|ed
him, the conjurer was a good
chri&s;tian; and that he gained all his
knowledge by conver&s;ing with the
&s;tars and planets. Thus &s;atisfied, the
two friends re&s;olved to con&s;ult him as
&s;oon as it &s;hould be light; and being
directed to the place of his habitation,
<PB N="199" REF="202">
&s;et out for it by &s;even in the morning.
They found the hou&s;e for&s;aken, and
had already reached the end of the
lane in their return, when they were
acco&s;ted by an old woman, who gave
them to under&s;tand, that if they had
occa&s;ion for the advice of a fortune|teller,
as &s;he did &s;uppo&s;e they had,
from their &s;topping at the hou&s;e where
Dr. Grubble lived, &s;he would conduct
them to a per&s;on of much more emi|nence
in that profe&s;&s;ion; at the &s;ame
time &s;he informed them, that the &s;aid
Grubble had been lately &s;ent to Bride|well;
a circum&s;tance which, with all
his art, he had not been able to fore|&s;ee.
The captain, without any &s;cru|ple,
put him&s;elf and his companion
under convoy of this beldame, who,
through many windings and turnings,
brought them to the door of a ruin|ous
hou&s;e, &s;tanding in a blind alley;
which door having opened with a key
drawn from her pocket, &s;he intro|duced
them into a parlour, where
they &s;aw no other furniture than a
naked bench, and &s;ome frightful fi|gures
<PB N="200" REF="203">
on the bare walls, drawn, or
rather &s;crawled with charcoal. Here
&s;he left them locked in, until &s;he
&s;hould give the doctor notice of their
arrival; and they amu&s;ed them&s;elves
with decyphering the&s;e characters and
hieroglyphics. The fir&s;t figure that
engaged their attention, was that of a
man hanging upon a gibbet, which
both con&s;idered as an unfavourable
omen, and each endeavoured to avert
from his own per&s;on. Crab&s;haw ob|&s;erved,
that the figure &s;o &s;u&s;pended
was cloathed in a &s;ailor's jacket and
trow&s;ers; a truth which the captain
could not deny; but on the other
hand he affirmed, that the &s;aid figure
exhibited the very no&s;e and chin of
Timothy, together with the hump on
one &s;houlder. A warm di&s;pute en|&s;ued;
and being maintained with
much acrimonious altercation, might
have di&s;&s;olved the new-cemented
friend&s;hip of the&s;e two originals, had
it not been interrupted by the old &s;y|bil,
who, coming into the parlour,
intimated that the doctor waited for
<PB N="201" REF="204">
them above. She likewi&s;e told them
that he never admitted more than one
at a time. This hint occa&s;ioned a
fre&s;h conte&s;t: the captain in&s;i&s;ted up|on
Crab&s;haw's making &s;ail a-head, in
order to look out afore; but Timothy
per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing this honour, de|claring
he did not pretend to lead, but
he would follow, as in duty bound.
The old gentlewoman abridged the
ceremony, by leading out Crab&s;haw
with one hand, and locking up Crowe
with the other. The former was
dragged up &s;tairs like a bear to the
&s;take, not without reluctance and ter|ror,
which did not at all abate at &s;ight
of the conjurer, with whom he was
immediately &s;hut up by his conduc|tre&s;s;
after &s;he had told him in a
whi&s;per, that he mu&s;t depo&s;it a &s;hil|ling
in a little black coffin, &s;upported
by a human &s;kull and thigh bones
cro&s;&s;ed, on a &s;tool covered with black
bays, that &s;tood in one corner of the
apartment. The &s;quire having made
this offering with fear and trembling,
ventured to &s;urvey the objects around
<PB N="202" REF="205">
him, which were very well calculated
to augment his confu&s;ion. He &s;aw di|vers
&s;keletons hung by the head; the
&s;tuffed &s;kin of a young alligator, a
calf with two heads, and &s;everal
&s;nakes &s;u&s;pended from the cieling,
with the jaws of a &s;hark, and a &s;tarved
wea&s;le. On another funereal table he
beheld two &s;pheres, between which
lay a book open, exhibiting outlandi&s;h
characters, and mathematical dia|grams.
On one &s;ide &s;tood an ink|&s;tandi&s;h
with paper, and behind this
de&s;k appeared the conjurer him&s;elf in
&s;able ve&s;tments, his head &s;o over&s;ha|dowed
with hair, that, far from con|templating
his features, Timothy could
di&s;tingui&s;h nothing but a long white
beard, which, for ought he knew,
might have belonged to a four-legged
goat, as well as to a two-legged a&s;tro|loger.</P>
<P>This apparition, which the &s;quire
did not eye without manife&s;t di&s;com|po&s;ure,
extending a white wand, made
certain evolutions over the head of Ti|mothy,
and having muttered an eja|culation,
<PB N="203" REF="206">
commanded him, in a hol|low
tone, to come forward and declare
his name. Crab&s;haw thus adjured ad|vanced
to the altar; and whether
from de&s;ign, or (which is more pro|bable)
from confu&s;ion, an&s;wered &startq;Sa|muel
Crowe.&endq; The conjurer taking
up the pen, and making a few
&s;cratches on the paper, exclaimed in
a terrific accent; &startq;How! mi&s;creant!
attempt to impo&s;e upon the &s;tars?&mdash;you
look more like a <HI>crab</HI> than a
<HI>crow,</HI> and was born under the &s;ign of
Cancer.&endq; The &s;quire, almo&s;t anni|hilated
by this exclamation, fell upon
his knees, crying, &startq;I pray yaw, my
lord conjurer's wor&s;hip, pardon my
ignorance, and down't go to baind me
oover to the Red Sea like&mdash;I'&s;e a
poor York&s;hire tyke, and wou'd no
more cheat the &s;tars than I'd cheat
my own vather, as the &s;aying is&mdash;
a mu&s;t be a good hand at <HI>trapping,</HI>
that catches the &s;tarns a <HI>napping</HI>&mdash;but
as your honour's wor&s;hip ob&s;erved;
my name is Tim Crab&s;haw, of the
Ea&s;t Raiding, groom and &s;quair to Sir
<PB N="204" REF="207">
Launcelot Greaves, baron knaight, and
arrant knaight, who ran mad for a
wench, as your wor&s;hip's conjuration
well knoweth:&mdash;the per&s;on below is
captain Crowe; and we coom by Mar|gery
Cook's recommendation to &s;eek
after my ma&s;ter, who is gone away,
or made away, the Lord he knows
how and where.&endq;</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by the
conjurer, who exhorted him to &s;it
down and compo&s;e him&s;elf until he
&s;hould ca&s;t a figure: then he &s;crawled
the paper, and waving his wand, re|peated
abundance of gibberi&s;h con|cerning
the number, the names, the
hou&s;es, and revolutions of the planets,
with their conjunctions, oppo&s;itions,
&s;igns, circles, cycles, trines, and tri|gons.
When he perceived that this
artifice had its proper effect in di&s;turb|ing
the brain of Crab&s;haw, he pro|ceeded
to tell him from the &s;tars, that
his name was Crab&s;haw, or Crab&s;|claw;
that he was born in the Ea&s;t|riding
of York&s;hire, of poor, yet ho|ne&s;t
parents, and had &s;ome &s;kill in
<PB N="205" REF="208">
hor&s;es; that he &s;erved a gentleman,
who&s;e name began with the letter G&mdash;,which
gentleman had run mad
for love, and left his family; but
whether he would return alive or dead
the &s;tars had not yet determined. Poor
Timothy was thunder&s;truck to find
the conjurer acquainted with all the&s;e
circum&s;tances, and begged to know if
he mought be &s;o bauld as to ax a que&s;|tion
or two about his own fortune.
The a&s;trologer pointing to the little
coffin, our &s;quire under&s;tood the hint,
and depo&s;ited another &s;hilling. The
&s;age had recour&s;e to his book, erected
another &s;cheme, performed once more
his airy evolutions with the wand, and
having recited another my&s;tical pre|amble,
expounded the book of fate
in the&s;e words: &startq;You &s;hall neither
die by war nor water, by hunger or
by thir&s;t, nor be brought to the grave
by old age or di&s;temper; but, let me
&s;ee&mdash;ay, the &s;tars will have it &s;o&mdash;you
&s;hall be&mdash;exalted&mdash;hah!&mdash;ay,
that is&mdash;hanged for hor&s;e-&s;tealing&endq;
&mdash;&startq;O, good my lord conjurer!
<PB N="206" REF="209">
(roared the &s;quire) I'd as lief give for|ty
&s;hillings as be hanged.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Peace,
&s;irrah! (cried the other) would you
contradict or rever&s;e the immutable
decrees of fate. Hanging is your de|&s;tiny;
and hanged you &s;hall be&mdash;and
comfort your&s;elf with the reflection,
that as you are not the fir&s;t, &s;o nei|ther
will you be the la&s;t to &s;wing on
Tyburn-tree.&endq; This comfortable a&s;|&s;urance
compo&s;ed the mind of Timo|thy,
and in a great mea&s;ure reconciled
him to the prediction. He now pro|ceeded
in a whining tone, to a&s;k whe|ther
he &s;hould &s;uffer for the fir&s;t fact?
whether it would be for a hor&s;e or a
mare? and of what colour? that he
might know when his hour was
come.&endq;&mdash;The conjurer gravely an|&s;wered,
that he would &s;teal a dappled
gelding on a Wedne&s;day; be ca&s;t at
the Old Baily on Thur&s;day, and &s;uffer
on a Friday; and he &s;trenuou&s;ly re|commended
it to him, to appear in
the cart with a no&s;egay in one hand,
and the Whole Duty of Man in the
other.&endq; &startq;But if in ca&s;e it &s;hould be
<PB N="207" REF="210">
in the winter (&s;aid the &s;quire) when a
no&s;egay can't be had&endq;&mdash;Why then
(replied the conjurer) an orange will
do as well.&endq; The&s;e material points
being adju&s;ted to the entire &s;atisfaction
of Timothy, he declared he would
be&s;tow another &s;hilling to know the
fortune of an old companion, who
truly did not de&s;erve &s;o much at his
hands; but he could not help loving
him better than e'er a friend he had in
the world. So &s;aying, he dropped a
third offering in the coffin, and de&s;ir|ed
to know the fate of his hor&s;e Gil|bert.
The a&s;trologer having again
con&s;ulted his art, pronounced, that
Gilbert would die of the &s;taggers, and
his carca&s;e be given to the hounds; a
&s;entence, which made a much deeper
impre&s;&s;ion upon Crab&s;haw's mind,
than did the prediction of his own un|timely
and di&s;graceful fate. He &s;hed a
plenteous &s;hower of tears, and his grief
broke forth in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;|&s;ions
of tenderne&s;s:&mdash;at length he told
the a&s;trologer he would go and &s;end up
the captain, who wanted to con&s;ult
<PB N="208" REF="211">
him about Margery Cook, becau&s;e as
how &s;he had informed him that Dr.
Grubble had de&s;cribed ju&s;t &s;uch ano|ther
man as the captain for her true
love; and he had no great &s;tomach
to the match, if &s;o be as the &s;tars
were not bent upon their coming to|gether.
Accordingly the &s;quire being
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the conjurer, de&s;cended
to the parlour with a rueful length of
face; which being perceived by the
captain, he demanded &startq;What cheer,
ho?&endq; with &s;ome &s;igns of apprehen|&s;ion.
Crab&s;haw making no return to
this &s;alute, he a&s;ked if the conjurer
had taken an ob&s;ervation, and told
him any thing? Then the other re|plied,
he had told him more than he
de&s;ired to know. &startq;Why, an that be
the ca&s;e, (&s;aid the &s;eaman) I have no
occa&s;ion to go aloft this trip, brother.&endq;
This eva&s;ion would not &s;erve his turn:
old Ti&s;iphone was at hand, and led
him up growling into the hall of au|dience,
which he did not examine
without trepidation. Having been di|rected
to the coffin, where he pre&s;ent|ed
<PB N="209" REF="212">
half a crown, in hope of rendering
the fates more propitious, the u&s;ual
ceremony was performed; and the
doctor addre&s;&s;ed him in the&s;e words:
&startq;Approach, Raven.&endq; The captain
advancing, &startq;You an't much mi&s;taken,
brother, (&s;aid he) heave your eye in|to
the binnacle, and box your com|pa&s;s;
you'll find I'm a Crowe, not a
Raven, tho'f indeed they be both fowls
of a feather, as the &s;aying is.&endq;&mdash;&startq;I
know it; (cried the conjurer) thou art
a northern crow,&mdash;a &s;ea crow; not a
crow of prey, but a crow to be preyed
upon:&mdash;a crow to be plucked,&mdash;to be
flayed,&mdash;to be ba&s;ted,&mdash;to be broiled
by Margery upon the gridiron of ma|trimony&mdash;&endq;
The novice changing
colour at this denunciation, &startq;I do
under&s;tand your &s;ignals, brother, (&s;aid
he) and if it be &s;et down in the log|book
of fate, that we mu&s;t grapple,
why then, 'ware timbers. But as I
know how the land lies, d'ye &s;ee, and
the current of my inclination &s;ets me
off, I &s;hall haul up clo&s;e to the wind,
and mayhap we &s;hall clear Cape Mar|gery.
<PB N="210" REF="213">
But, how&s;omever, we &s;hall
leave that reef in the foretop&s;ail:&mdash;I
was bound upon another voyage,
d'ye &s;ee&mdash;to look and to &s;ee, and to
know, if &s;o be as how I could pick up
any intelligence along &s;hore, concern|ing
my friend Sir Launcelot, who &s;lip|ped
his cable la&s;t night, and has lo&s;t
company, d'ye &s;ee.&endq; &startq;What! (ex|claimed
the cunning man) art thou a
crow, and can'&s;t not &s;mell carrion?
If thou would&s;t grieve for Greaves,
behold his naked carca&s;e lies unburied
to feed the kites, the crows, the
gulls, the rooks, and ravens.&mdash;'
&startq;What, broach'd to?&endq; &startq;Dead! as a
boil'd lob&s;ter.&endq; &startq;Odd's heart! friend,
the&s;e are the heavie&s;t tidings I have
heard the&s;e &s;even long years&mdash;there
mu&s;t have been deadly odds when he
lowered his top&s;ails&mdash;Smite my eyes!
I had rather the Mufti had foundered
at &s;ea, with my&s;elf and all my gene|ration
on board&mdash;well fare thy &s;oul,
flower of the world! had hone&s;t Sam
Crowe been within hail&mdash;but what
&s;ignifies palavering.&endq; Here the tears
<PB N="211" REF="214">
of unaffected &s;orrow flowed plentiful|ly
down the furrows of the &s;eaman's
cheeks:&mdash;then his grief giving way to
his indignation, &startq;Hark ye, brother
conjurer, (&s;aid he) you that can &s;py
foul weather before it comes, damn
your eyes! why did not you give us
warning of this here &s;quall? Bla&s;t my
limbs! I'll make you give an account
of this here damned, horrid, con|founded
murder, d'ye &s;ee&mdash;mayhap
you your&s;elf was concerned, d'ye &s;ee.&mdash;For
my own part, brother, I put
my tru&s;t in God, and &s;teer by the
compa&s;s; and I value not your paw|wawing,
and your conjuration, of a
rope's end, d'ye &s;ee.&endq;&mdash;The conjurer
was by no means plea&s;ed, either with
the matter, or the manner of this
addre&s;s. He therefore began to &s;oothe
the captain's choler, by repre&s;enting
that he did not pretend to omni|&s;cience,
which was the attribute of God
alone; that human art was fallible
and imperfect; and all that it could
perform, was to di&s;cover certain par|tial
circum&s;tances of any particular ob|ject
<PB N="212" REF="215">
to which its enquiries were direc|ted:
that being que&s;tioned by the
other man, concerning the cau&s;e of
his ma&s;ter's di&s;appearing, he had ex|erci&s;ed
his &s;kill upon the &s;ubject, and
found rea&s;on to believe that Sir Laun|celot
was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; that he &s;hould
think him&s;elf happy in being the in|&s;trument
of bringing the murderers to
ju&s;tice, though he fore&s;aw they would
of them&s;elves &s;ave him that trouble;
for they would quarrel about dividing
the &s;poil, and one would give infor|mation
again&s;t the other.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of this &s;atisfaction ap|pea&s;ed
the re&s;entment, and, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, mitigated the grief of cap|tain
Crowe, who took his leave with|out
much ceremony; and being join|ed
by Crab&s;haw, proceeded with a
heavy heart to the hou&s;e of Sir Laun|celot,
where they found the dome&s;tics
at breakfa&s;t, without exhibiting the
lea&s;t &s;ymptom of concern for their
ab&s;ent ma&s;ter. Crowe had been wi&s;e
enough to conceal from Crab&s;haw
what he had learned of the knight's
<PB N="213" REF="216">
fate. This fatal intelligence he re|&s;erved
for the ear of his nephew, Mr.
Clarke, who did not fail to attend
him in the forenoon.</P>
<P>As for the &s;quire, he did nothing
but ruminate in rueful &s;ilence upon
the dappled gelding, the no&s;egay, and
the predicted fate of Gilbert. Him
he forthwith vi&s;ited in the &s;table, and
&s;aluted with the ki&s;s of peace. Then
he bemoaned his fortune with tears,
and by the &s;ound of his own lamenta|tion,
was Iulled a&s;leep among the
litter.</P>

<P>WE mu&s;t now leave Capt. Crowe
and his nephew Mr. Clarke,
arguing with great vehemence about
the fatal intelligence obtained from
the conjurer, and penetrate at once
the veil that concealed our hero.
Know then, reader, that Sir Launce|lot
Greaves, repairing to the place de|&s;cribed
in the billet which he had
<PB N="214" REF="217">
received, was $word$ by a per&s;on
muffled in a cloak $word$ began to
amu&s;e him with a reigned &s;tory of
Aurelia; to which, while he li&s;tened
with great attention, he found him|&s;elf
&s;uddenly &s;urrounded by armed
men, who &s;eized and pinioned down
his arms, took away his &s;word, and
conveyed him by force into a hack|ney-coach
provided for the purpo&s;e.
In vain he expo&s;tulated on this vio|lence
with three per&s;ons who accom|panied
him in the vehicle. He could
not extort one word by way of reply;
and, from their gloomy a&s;pects, he
began to be apprehen&s;ive of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation.
Had the carriage pa&s;&s;ed
through any unfrequented place, he
would have endeavoured to alarm
the inhabitants; but it was already
clear of the town, and his conductors
took care to avoid all villages and in|habited
hou&s;es.</P>
<P>After having travelled about two
miles, the coach &s;topped at a large
iron-gate, which being opened, our
adventurer was led in &s;ilence thro'
<PB N="215" REF="218">
a &s;pacious hou&s;e into a tolerably de|cent
apartment, which he under&s;tood
was intended for his bed-chamber.
In a few minutes after his arrival, he
was vi&s;ited by a man of no very pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
appearance, who endea|voured
to &s;moothe his countenance,
which was naturally &s;tern, welcomed
our adventurer to his hou&s;e; exhort|ed
him to be of good cheer, a&s;&s;uring
him he &s;hould want for nothing;
and de&s;ired to know what he would
choo&s;e for &s;upper.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, in an&s;wer to this ci|vil
addre&s;s, begged he would explain
the nature of his confinement, and
the rea&s;ons for which his arms were
tied like tho&s;e of the wor&s;t malefac|tor.
The other po&s;tponed till to|morrow
the explanation he demand|ed;
but, in the mean time, unbound
his fetters, and as he declined eating,
left him alone to his repo&s;e. He took
care, however, in retiring, to double-lock
the door of the room, who&s;e
windows were grated on the out&s;ide
with i$on.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="219">
The knight, being thus abandon|ed
to his own meditations, began to
ruminate on the pre&s;ent adventure
with equal &s;urprize and concern; but
the more he revolved circum&s;tances,
the more was he perplexed in his
conjectures. According to the &s;tate
of the mind, a very &s;ubtle philo&s;o|pher
is often puzzled by a very plain
propo&s;ition; and this was the ca&s;e
of our adventurer&mdash;What made the
&s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind,
was a notion that he was apprehended
on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable practices,
by a warrant from the &s;ecretary of
&s;tate, in con&s;equence of &s;ome fal&s;e
malicious information; and that his
pri&s;on was no other than the hou&s;e of
a me&s;&s;enger, &s;et apart for the accom|modation
of &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons. In
this opinion, he comforted him&s;elf
by recollecting his own con&s;cious in|nocence,
and reflecting that he &s;hould
be intitled to the privilege of habeas
corpus, as the act including that ine|&s;timable
jewel, was happily not &s;u&s;|pended
at this time.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="220">
Con&s;oled by this &s;elf-a&s;&s;urance, he
quietly re&s;igned him&s;elf to &s;lumber;
but, before he fell a&s;leep, he was very
di&s;agreeably undeceived in his con|jecture.
His ears were all at once &s;a|luted
with a noi&s;e from the next room,
conveyed in di&s;tinct bounces again&s;t
the wain&s;cot; then an hoar&s;e voice
exclaimed, &startq;Bring up the artillery&mdash;let
Brutandorf's brigade advance&mdash;de|tach
my black hu&s;&s;ars to ravage the
country&mdash;let them be new-booted&mdash;take
particular care of the &s;pur-lea|thers&mdash;make
a de&s;ert of Lu&s;atia&mdash;bombard

my brother Henry to pa&s;s the Elbe

fifty &s;quadrons&mdash;&s;o ho, you major|general
Donder, why don't you fini&s;h
your &s;econd parallel?&mdash;&s;end hither
the engineer Schittenbach&mdash;I'll lay
all the &s;hoes in my &s;hop, the breach
will be practicable in four and twenty
hours&mdash;don't tell me of your works&mdash;you
and your works may be damn'd&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;&s;uredly, (cried another voice
from a different quarter) he that
<PB N="218" REF="221">
thinks to be &s;aved by works is in a
&s;tate of utter reprobation&mdash;I my&s;elf
was a prophane weaver, and tru&s;ted
to the rottenne&s;s of works&mdash;I kept my
journeymen and 'prentices at con&s;tant
work; and my heart was &s;et upon
the riches of this world, which was
a wicked work&mdash;but now I have got
a glimp&s;e of the new-light&mdash;I feel
the operations of grace&mdash;I am of the
new birth&mdash;I abhor good works&mdash;I
dete&s;t all working but the working
of the &s;pirit&mdash;Avaunt, Satan&mdash;O!
how I thir&s;t for communication with
our &s;i&s;ter Jolly&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;The communication is already
open with the Marche, (&s;aid the fir&s;t)
but as for thee, thou caitif, who ha&s;t
pre&s;umed to di&s;parage my works, I'll
have thee rammed into a mortar with
a double charge of powder, and
thrown into the enemy's quarters.&endq;</P>
<P>This dialogue operated like a train
upon many other inhabitants of the
place: one &s;wore he was within three
vibrations of finding the longitude,
when this noi&s;e confounded his cal|culation:
<PB N="219" REF="222">
a &s;econd, in broken Eng|li&s;h,
complained he vas di&s;torped in
the moment of de pro&s;hection&mdash;a
third, in the character of his holine&s;s,
denounced interdiction, excommuni|cation,
and anathemas; and &s;wore by
St. Peter's keys, they &s;hould howl ten
thou&s;and years in purgatory, without
the benefit of a &s;ingle ma&s;s. A
fourth began to hollow in all the vo|ciferation
of a fox-hunter in the
chace; and in an in&s;tant the whole
hou&s;e was in an uproar&mdash;The cla|mour,
however, was of a &s;hort du|ration.
The different chambers be|ing
opened &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, every indi|vidual
was effectually &s;ilenced by the
&s;ound of one cabali&s;tical word, which
was no other than <HI>wai&s;tcoat:</HI> a charm
which at once cowed the king of
P&mdash;, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fanatic, dumb|founded
the mathematician, di&s;mayed
the alchemi&s;t, depo&s;ed the pope, and
deprived the '&s;quire of all utterance.</P>
<P>Our adventurer was no longer in
doubt concerning the place to which
he had been conveyed; and the more
<PB N="220" REF="223">
he reflected on his &s;ituation, the more
he was overwhelmed with the mo&s;t
perplexing chagrin. He could not
conceive by who&s;e means he had been
immured in a mad-hou&s;e; but he
heartily repented of his knight-erran|try,
as a frolic which might have ve|ry
&s;erious con&s;equences, with re&s;pect
to his future life and fortune. After
mature deliberation, he re&s;olved to
demean him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t cir|cum&s;pection,
well knowing that every
violent tran&s;port would be interpreted
into an undeniable &s;ymptom of in&s;a|nity.
He was not without hope of
being able to move his jailor by a due
admini&s;tration of that which is gene|rally
more efficacious than all the
flowers of elocution; but when he
ro&s;e in the morning, he found his
pockets had been carefully examined,
and emptied of all his papers and
ca&s;h.</P>
<P>The keeper entering, he enquired
about the&s;e particulars, and was gi|ven
to under&s;tand that they were all
&s;afely depo&s;ited for his u&s;e, to be
<PB N="221" REF="224">
forthcoming at a proper &s;ea&s;on: but,
at pre&s;ent, as he &s;hould want for no|thing,
he had no occa&s;ion for money.
The knight acquie&s;ced in this decla|ration,
and eat his breakfa&s;t in quiet.
About eleven, he received a vi&s;it from
the phy&s;ician, who contemplated his
looks with great &s;olemnity; and hav|ing
examined his pul&s;e, &s;hook his
head, &s;aying, &startq;Well, Sir, how d'ye
do?&mdash;come, don't be dejected&mdash;
every thing is for the be&s;t&mdash;you are in
very good hands, Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you:
and I dare &s;ay will refu&s;e nothing that
may be thought conducive to the re|covery
of your health.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Doctor, (&s;aid our hero) if it is
not an improper que&s;tion to a&s;k, I
&s;hould be glad to know your opinion
of my di&s;order&endq;&mdash;&startq;O! Sir, as to that
&mdash;(replied the phy&s;ician) your di&s;or|der
is a&mdash;kind of a&mdash;Sir, 'tis very
common in this country&mdash;a &s;ort of
a&endq;&mdash;&startq;Do you think my di&s;temper
is madne&s;s, doctor?&endq;&mdash;&startq;O Lord!
Sir,&mdash;not ab&s;olute madne&s;s&mdash;no&mdash;not
madne&s;s&mdash;you have heard, no doubt,
<PB N="222" REF="225">
of what is called a weakne&s;s of the
nerves, Sir,&mdash;tho' that is a very inac|curate
expre&s;&s;ion; for this phra&s;e,
denoting a morbid exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ation,
&s;eems to imply that &s;en&s;ation it&s;elf is
owing to the loo&s;e cohe&s;ion of tho&s;e
material particles which con&s;titute the
nervous &s;ub&s;tance, ina&s;much as the
quantity of every effect mu&s;t be pro|portionable
to its cau&s;e; now you'll
plea&s;e to take notice, Sir, if the ca&s;e
were really what the&s;e words &s;eem to
import, all bodies, who&s;e particles do
not cohere with too great a degree of
proximity, would be nervous; that
is, endued with &s;en&s;ation&mdash;Sir, I &s;hall
order &s;ome cooling things to keep you
in due temperature; and you'll do
very well&mdash;Sir, your humble &s;ervant.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he returned, and our
adventurer could not but think it was
very hard that one man &s;hould not
dare to a&s;k the mo&s;t ordinary que&s;tion
without being reputed mad, while
another &s;hould talk non&s;en&s;e by the
hour, and yet be e&s;teemed as an ora|cle
&mdash;The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e find|ing
<PB N="223" REF="226">
Sir Launcelot &s;o tame and tracta|ble,
indulged him after dinner with
a walk in a little private garden, un|der
the eye of a &s;ervant who follow|ed
him at a di&s;tance. Here he was
&s;aluted by a brother pri&s;oner, a man
&s;eemingly turned of thirty, tall and
thin, with &s;taring eyes, a hook-no&s;e,
and a face covered with pimples.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual compliments having
pa&s;&s;ed, the &s;tranger, without further
ceremony, a&s;ked if he would oblige
him with a chew of tobacco, or could
&s;pare him a mouthful of any &s;ort of
cordial, declaring he had not ta&s;ted
brandy &s;ince he came to the hou&s;e&mdash;
The knight a&s;&s;ured him it was not
in his power to comply with his re|que&s;t;
and began to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;|tions
relating to the character of their
landlord, which the &s;tranger repre|&s;ented
in very unfavourable colours.
He de&s;cribed him as a ruffian, capa|ble
of undertaking the darke&s;t &s;chemes
of villainy. He &s;aid his hou&s;e was a
repo&s;itory of the mo&s;t flagrant iniqui|ties:
that it contained fathers kidnap|ped
<PB N="224" REF="227">
by their children, wives confined
by their hu&s;bands, gentlemen of for|tune
&s;eque&s;tered by their relations,
and innocent per&s;ons immured by the
malice of their adver&s;aries. He
a&s;&s;irmed this was his own ca&s;e; and
a&s;ked if our hero had never heard of
Dick Di&s;tich, the poet and &s;atiri&s;t.
&startq;Ben Bullock and I (&s;aid he)&endq; were
confident again&s;t the world in arms&mdash;
did you never &s;ee his ode to me be|ginning
with &startq;Fair blooming youth.&endq;
We were &s;worn brothers, admired
and prai&s;ed, and quoted each other,
Sir: we denounced war again&s;t all the
world, actors, authors, and critics; and
having drawn the &s;word, threw away
the &s;cabbard&mdash;we pu&s;hed through
thick and thin, hacked and hewed
helter &s;kelter, and became as formi|dable
to the writers of the age, as the
Boeotian band of Thebes. My friend
Bullock, indeed, was once rolled in
the kennel; but &s;oon
<Q><L>He vig'rous ro&s;e, and from th' effluvia &s;trong</L>
<L>Imbib'd new life, and &s;cour'd and &s;tunk along.</L></Q>
<PB N="225" REF="228">
Here is a &s;atire, which I wrote in an
alehou&s;e when I was drunk&mdash;I can
prove it by the evidence of the land|lord
and his wife: I fancy you'll own
I have &s;ome right to &s;ay with my
friend Horace,
<Q><L>Qui me commorit, meli&ugrave;s non tangere
clamo;</L>
<L>Flebit et in&s;ignis toto cantabitur urbe.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The knight, having peru&s;ed the
papers, declared his opinion that the
ver&s;es were tolerably good; but at
the &s;ame time ob&s;erved that the au|thor
had reviled as ignorant dunces
&s;everal per&s;ons who had writ with
reputation, and were generally al|lowed
to have genius: a circum&s;tance
that would detract more from his
candour, than could be allowed to
his capacity.</P>
<P>&startq;Damn their genius! (cried the
&s;atyri&s;t) a pack of impertinent ra&s;|cals!
I tell you, Sir, Ben Bullock
and I had determined to cru&s;h all that
were not of our own party&mdash;be&s;ides,
<PB N="226" REF="229">
I &s;aid before, this piece was written
in drink.&endq; &startq;Was you drunk too
when it was printed and publi&s;hed?&endq;
&startq;Yes, the printer &s;hall make affida|vit
that I was never otherwi&s;e than
drunk or maudlin, till my enemies,
on pretence that my brain was turn|ed,
conveyed me to this infernal
man&s;ion&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They &s;eem to have been your
be&s;t friends, (&s;aid the knight) and
have put the mo&s;t tender interpreta|tion
on your conduct; for, waving
the plea of in&s;anity, your character
mu&s;t &s;tand as that of a man who hath
&s;ome &s;mall &s;hare of genius, without
an atom of integrity&mdash;Of all tho&s;e
whom Pope la&s;hed in his Dunciad,
there was not one who did not richly
de&s;erve the imputation of dulne&s;s; and
every one of them had provoked the
&s;atiri&s;t by a per&s;onal attack. In this
re&s;pect the Engli&s;h poet was much
more hone&s;t than his French pattern
Boileau, who &s;tigmatized &s;everal men
of acknowledged genius; &s;uch as
Quinault, Perrault, and the cele|brated
<PB N="227" REF="230">
Lulli; for which rea&s;on every
man of a liberal turn mu&s;t, in &s;pite of
all his poetical merit, de&s;pi&s;e him as
a rancorous knave. If this di&s;ingenu|ous
conduct cannot be forgiven in a
writer of his &s;uperior genius, who will
pardon it in you who&s;e name is not
half emerged from ob&s;curity?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Heark ye, friend, (replied the
bard) keep your pardon and your
coun&s;el for tho&s;e who a&s;k it; or, if
you will force them upon people,
take one piece of advice in return: If
you don't like your pre&s;ent &s;ituation,
apply for a committee without delay:
they'll find you too much of a fool to
have the lea&s;t tincture of madne&s;s;
and you'll be relea&s;ed without further
&s;cruple: in that ca&s;e I &s;hall rejoice in
your deliverance; you will be freed
from confinement, and I &s;hall be hap|pily
deprived of your conver&s;ation.&endq;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he flew off at a tangent,
and our knight could not help &s;mil|ing
at the peculiar virulence of his di&s;|po&s;ition.
Sir Launcelot then endea|voured
to enter into conver&s;ation with
<PB N="228" REF="231">
his attendant, by a&s;king how long
Mr. Di&s;tich had re&s;ided in the hou&s;e;
but he might as well have addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to a Turki&s;h mute: the fel|low
either pretended ignorance, or
refu&s;ed an an&s;wer to every que&s;tion
that was propo&s;ed. He would not
even di&s;clo&s;e the name of his land|lord,
nor inform him whereabouts the
hou&s;e was &s;ituated.</P>
<P>Finding him&s;elf agitated with im|patience
and indignation, he returned
to his apartment, and the door being
locked upon him, began to review,
not without horror, the particulars of
his fate. &startq;How little rea&s;on (&s;aid he
to him&s;elf) have we to boa&s;t of the
ble&s;&s;ings enjoyed by the Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject,
if he holds them on &s;uch a pre|carious
tenure: if a man of rank and
property may be thus kidnapped even
in the mid&s;t of the capital; if he may
be &s;eized by ruffians, in&s;ulted, robbed,
and conveyed to &s;uch a pri&s;on as this,
from which there &s;eems to be no po&s;|&s;ibility
of e&s;cape; Should I be in|dulged
with pen, ink, and paper, and
<PB N="229" REF="232">
appeal to my relations, or to the ma|gi&s;trates
of my country, my letters
would be intercepted by tho&s;e who
&s;uperintend my confinement. Should
I try to alarm the neighbourhood, my
cries would be neglected as tho&s;e of
&s;ome unhappy lunatic under nece&s;&s;ary
correction. Should I employ the force
which heaven has lent me, I might
imbrue my hands in blood, and after
all find it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape through
a number of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive doors, locks,
bolts, and centinels. Should I en|deavour
to tamper with the &s;ervant,
he might di&s;cover my de&s;ign, and
then I &s;hould be abridged of the little
comfort I enjoy. People may inveigh
again&s;t the Ba&s;tile in France, and the
Inqui&s;ition in Portugal; but I would
a&s;k, if either of the&s;e be in reality &s;o
dangerous or dreadful as a private
mad-hou&s;e in England, under the di|rection
of a ruffian. The Ba&s;tile is
a &s;tate pri&s;on, the Inqui&s;ition is a &s;pi|ritual
tribunal; but both are under
the direction of government. It &s;el|dom,
<PB N="230" REF="233">
if ever, happens that a man in|tirely
innocent is confined in either;
or, if he &s;hould, he lays his account
with a legal trial before e&s;tabli&s;hed
judges. But in England, the mo&s;t
innocent per&s;on upon earth is liable to
be immured for life under the pretext
of lunacy, &s;eque&s;tered from his wife,
children, and friends, robbed of his
fortune, deprived even of nece&s;&s;aries,
and &s;ubjected to the mo&s;t brutal treat|ment
from a low-bred barbarian, who
rai&s;es an ample fortune on the mi&s;ery
of his fellow-creatures, and may, dur|ing
his whole life, practi&s;e this horrid
oppre&s;&s;ion, without que&s;tion or con|troul.&endq;</P>
<P>This uncomfortable reverie was in|terrupted
by a very unexpected &s;ound
that &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from the other
&s;ide of a thick party-wall. It was a
&s;train of vocal mu&s;ic, more plaintive
than the widow'd turtle's moan, more
&s;weet and ravi&s;hing than Philomel's
love-warbled &s;ong. Through his ear
it in&s;tantly pierced into his heart; for
at once he recognized it to be the voice
<PB N="231" REF="234">
of his adored Aurelia. Heavens!
what was the agitation of his &s;oul,
when he made this di&s;covery! how
did every nerve quiver! how did his
heart throb with the mo&s;t violent
emotion! He ran round the room in
di&s;traction, foaming like a lion in the
toil&mdash;then he placed his ear clo&s;e to
the partition, and li&s;tened as if his
whole &s;oul was exerted in his &s;en&s;e of
hearing. When the &s;ound cea&s;ed to
vibrate on his ear, he threw him&s;elf
on the bed; he groaned with angui&s;h,
he exclaimed in broken accents; and
in all probability his heart would have
bur&s;t, had not the violence of his &s;or|row
found vent in a flood of tears.</P>
<P>The&s;e fir&s;t tran&s;ports were &s;ucceed|ed
by a fit of impatience, which had
well-nigh deprived him of his &s;en&s;es
in good earne&s;t. His &s;urprize at find|ing
his lo&s;t Aurelia in &s;uch a place,
the &s;eeming impo&s;&s;ibility of relieving
her, and his un&s;peakable eagerne&s;s to
contrive &s;ome &s;cheme for profiting by
the intere&s;ting di&s;covery he had made,
concurred in brewing up a &s;econd ex|ta&s;y,
<PB N="232" REF="235">
during which he acted a thou|&s;and
extravagancies, which it was well
for him the attendants did not ob&s;erve.
Perhaps it was well for the &s;ervant that
he did not enter while the paroxy&s;m
prevailed: had this been the ca&s;e, he
might have met with the fate of Ly|chas,
whom Hercules in his frenzy
de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Before the cloth was laid for &s;up|per,
he was calm enough to conceal
the di&s;order of his mind: but he
complained of the head-ach, and de|&s;ired
he might be next day vi&s;ited by
the phy&s;ician, to whom he re&s;olved to
explain him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, as
&s;hould make an impre&s;&s;ion upon him,
provided he was not altogether de&s;ti|tute
of con&s;cience and humanity.</P>

<P>WHEN the doctor made his next
appearance in Sir Launcelot's
apartment, the knight addre&s;&s;ed him
in the&s;e words: &startq;Sir, the practice of
medicine is one of the mo&s;t honour|able
profe&s;&s;ions exerci&s;ed among the
&s;ons of men; a profe&s;&s;ion which hath
been revered at all periods and in all
nations, and even held &s;acred in the
mo&s;t poli&s;hed ages of antiquity. The
&s;cope of it is to pre&s;erve the being, and
confirm the health of our fellow-crea|tures;
of con&s;equence, to &s;u&s;tain the
ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety, and crown life
with fruition. The character of a
phy&s;ician, therefore, not only &s;uppo|&s;es
natural &s;agacity, and acquired eru|dition,
but it al&s;o implies every deli|cacy
of &s;entiment, every tenderne&s;s of
nature, and every virtue of humani|ty.
<PB N="234" REF="237">
That the&s;e qualities are centered
in you, doctor, I would willingly be|lieve:
but it will be &s;ufficient for my
purpo&s;e, that you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of com|mon
integrity. To who&s;e concern I
am indebted for your vi&s;its, you be&s;t
know: but if you under&s;tand the art
of medicine, you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible by
this time, that with re&s;pect to me your
pre&s;criptions are altogether unnece&s;&s;a|ry
&mdash;come, Sir, you cannot&mdash;you don't
believe that my intellects are di&s;or|dered.
Yet, granting me to be real|ly
under the influence of that deplor|able
malady, no per&s;on has a right to
treat me as a lunatic, or to &s;ue out a
commi&s;&s;ion, but my neare&s;t kindred.
&mdash;That you may not plead ignorance
of my name and family, you &s;hall un|der&s;tand
that I am Sir Launcelot
Greaves, of the county of York, ba|ronet;
and that my neare&s;t relation is
Sir Reginald Meadows, of Che&s;hire,
the elde&s;t &s;on of my mother's &s;i&s;ter&mdash;
that gentleman, I am &s;ure, had no
concern in &s;educing me by fal&s;e pre|tences
under the clouds of night into
<PB N="235" REF="238">
the fields, where I was &s;urpri&s;ed,
overpowered, and kidnapped by arm|ed
ruffians. Had he really believed
me in&s;ane, he would have pro|ceeded
according to the dictates of
honour, humanity, and the laws of
his country. Situated as I am, I have
a right, by making application to the
lord chancellor, to be tried by a jury
of hone&s;t men.&mdash;But of that right I
cannot avail my&s;elf, while I remain
at the mercy of a brutal mi&s;creant, in
who&s;e hou&s;e I am inclo&s;ed, unle&s;s you
contribute your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Your a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
therefore, I demand, as you
are a gentleman, a chri&s;tian, and a
fellow-&s;ubject, who, tho' every other
motive &s;hould be overlooked, ought
to intere&s;t him&s;elf in my ca&s;e as a
common concern, and concur with
all your power towards the puni&s;h|ment
of tho&s;e who dare commit &s;uch
outrages again&s;t the liberty of your
country.&endq;</P>
<P>The doctor &s;eemed to be a little
di&s;concerted; but after &s;ome recollec|tion,
re&s;umed his air of &s;ufficiency and
<PB N="236" REF="239">
importance, and a&s;&s;ured our adventu|rer
he would do him all the &s;ervice in
his power; but, in the mean time,
advi&s;ed him to take the potion he had
pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The knight's eyes lightning with
indignation, &startq;I am now convinced,
(cried he) that you are accomplice in
the villainy which has been practi&s;ed
upon me; that you are a &s;ordid
wretch, without principle or feeling,
a di&s;grace to the faculty, and a re|proach
to human nature&mdash;yes, &s;irrah,
you are the mo&s;t perfidious of all a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins
&mdash;you are the hireling mini&s;ter
of the wor&s;t of all villains; who from
motives even ba&s;er than malice, envy,
and revenge, rob the innocent of all
the comforts of life, brand them with
the imputation of madne&s;s, the mo&s;t
cruel &s;pecies of &s;lander, and wantonly
protract their mi&s;ery, by leaving them
in the mo&s;t &s;hocking confinement, a
prey to reflections infinitely more bit|ter
than death&mdash;but I will be calm&mdash;
do me ju&s;tice at your peril. I demand
the protection of the legi&s;lature&mdash;if I
<PB N="237" REF="240">
am refu&s;ed,&mdash;remember, a day of
reckoning will come&mdash;you and the re&s;t
of the mi&s;creants who have combined
again&s;t me, mu&s;t, in order to cloak
your treachery, have recour&s;e to mur|der;
an expedient which I believe
you very capable of embracing, or a
man of my rank and character cannot
be much longer concealed&mdash;Trem|ble,
caitif, at the thoughts of my re|lea&s;e
&mdash;in the mean time, be gone,
le&s;t my ju&s;t re&s;entment impel me to
da&s;h out your brains upon that mar|ble
&mdash;away&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>The hone&s;t doctor was not &s;o firm|ly
per&s;uaded of his patient's lunacy as
to reject his advice, which he made
what ha&s;te he could to follow, when
an unexpected accident intervened.
That this may be properly introduced,
we mu&s;t return to the knight's brace
of tru&s;ty friends, captain Crowe and
lawyer Clarke, whom we left in &s;or|rowful
deliberation upon the fate of
their patron. Clarke's genius being
rather more fruitful in re&s;ources than
that of the &s;eaman, he &s;ugge&s;ted an
<PB N="238" REF="241">
adverti&s;ement, which was according|ly
in&s;erted in the daily papers; im|porting
that, &startq;Whereas a gentleman
of con&s;iderable rank and fortune had
&s;uddenly di&s;appeared on &s;uch a night
from his hou&s;e near Golden-&s;quare,
in con&s;equence of a letter delivered
to him by a porter; and there is great
rea&s;on to believe &s;ome violence hath
been offered to his life: any per&s;on
capable of giving &s;uch information as
may tend to clear up this dark tran&s;|action,
&s;hall, by applying to Mr. Tho|mas
Clarke, attorney, at his lodgings
in Upper Brook-&s;treet, receive proper
&s;ecurity for the reward of one hun|dred
guineas, to be paid to him upon
his making the di&s;covery required.&endq;</P>
<P>The porter who delivered the let|ter
appeared accordingly, but could
give no other information, except that
it was put into his hand with a &s;hil|ling,
by a man muffled up in a great
coat, who &s;topped him for the pur|po&s;e,
in his pa&s;&s;ing through Queen-&s;treet.
It was nece&s;&s;ary that the ad|verti&s;ement
&s;hould produce an effect
<PB N="239" REF="242">
upon another per&s;on, who was no
other than the hackney coachman,
who drove our hero to the place of
his impri&s;onment. This fellow had
been enjoined &s;ecrecy, and indeed
bribed to hold his tongue, by a con|&s;iderable
gratification, which, it was
&s;uppo&s;ed, would have been effec|tual,
as the man was a ma&s;ter coach|man
in good circum&s;tances, and well
known to the keeper of the mad|hou&s;e,
by whom he had been em|ployed
on former occa&s;ions of the
&s;ame nature. Perhaps his fidelity to
his employer, reinforced by the hope
of many future jobbs of that kind,
might have been proof again&s;t the of|fer
of fifty pounds; but double that
&s;um was a temptation he could not
re&s;i&s;t. He no &s;ooner read the intima|tion
in the Daily Adverti&s;er, over his
morning's pot at an ale-hou&s;e, than
he entered into con&s;ultation with his
own thoughts; and having no rea&s;on
to doubt that this was the very fare he
had conveyed, he re&s;olved to earn the
reward, and ab&s;tain from all &s;uch ad|ventures
<PB N="240" REF="243">
in time coming. He had the
precaution, however, to take an at|torney
along with him to Mr. Clarke,
who entered into a conditional bond;
and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his uncle,
depo&s;ited the money, to be forthcom|ing
when the conditions &s;hould be ful|filled.
The&s;e previous mea&s;ures being
taken, the coachman declared what
he knew, and di&s;covered the hou&s;e in
which Sir Launcelot had been immur|ed.
He moreover accompanied our
two adherents to a judge's chamber,
where he made oath to the truth of
his information; and a warrant was im|ediately
granted to &s;earch the hou&s;e of
Bernard Shackle, and &s;et at liberty Sir
Launcelot Greaves, if there found.</P>
<P>Fortified with this authority, they
engaged a con&s;table with a formidable
po&s;&s;e, and embarking them in coaches,
repaired, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition,
to the hou&s;e of Mr. Shackle, who
did not think proper to di&s;pute their
claim, but admitted them, though
not without betraying evident &s;ymp|toms
of con&s;ternation. One of
<PB N="241" REF="244">
the &s;ervants directing them, by his
ma&s;ter's order, to Sir Launcelot's
apartment; they hurried up &s;tairs in
a body, occa&s;ioning &s;uch a noi&s;e as
did not fail to alarm the phy&s;ician,
who had ju&s;t opened the door to re|tire,
when he perceived their irrup|tion.
Captain Crowe conjecturing he
was guilty, from the confu&s;ion that
appeared in his countenance, made no
&s;cruple of &s;eizing him by the collar,
as he endeavoured to retreat; while
the tender-hearted Tom Clarke, run|ning
up to the knight with his eyes
brimful of joy and affection, forgot all
the forms of di&s;tant re&s;pect, and
throwing his arms around his neck,
blubbered in his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Our hero did not receive this proof
of his attachment unmoved. He
&s;trained him in his embrace, honour|ed
him with the title of his deliverer,
and a&s;ked him by what miracle he
had di&s;covered the place of his con|finement.
The lawyer began to un|fold
the various &s;teps he had taken,
with equal minutene&s;s and &s;elf-com|placency,
<PB N="242" REF="245">
when Crowe, dragging the
doctor &s;till by the collar, &s;hook his
old friend by the hand, prote&s;ting he
was never &s;o overjoyed &s;ince he got
clear of a Sallee Rover on the coa&s;t
of Barbary; and that two gla&s;&s;es ago
he would have &s;tarted all the money
he had in the world in the hold of any
man who would have &s;hewn Sir Laun|celot
&s;afe at his moorings. The knight,
having made a proper return to this
&s;incere manife&s;tation of good will, de|&s;ired
him to di&s;mi&s;s that worthle&s;s
fellow, meaning the doctor, who,
finding him&s;elf relea&s;ed, withdrew
with &s;ome precipitation.</P>
<P>Then our adventurer, attended by
his friends, walked with a deliberate
pace to the outward gate, which he
found open, and getting into one of
the coaches, was entertained by the
way to his own hou&s;e with a detail
of every mea&s;ure which had been
pur&s;ued for his relea&s;e. In his own
parlour he found Mrs. Dolly Cow&s;hip,
who had been waiting with great fear
and impatience for the i&s;&s;ue of Mr.
<PB N="243" REF="246">
Clarke's adventure. She now fell up|on
her knees, and bathed the knight's
hand with tears of joy; while the face
of this young woman, recalling the
idea of her mi&s;tre&s;s, rou&s;ed his heart
to &s;trong emotions, and &s;timulated his
mind to the immediate atchievement
he had already planned. As for Crab|&s;haw,
he was not the la&s;t to &s;ignify
his &s;atisfaction at his ma&s;ter's return.
After having ki&s;&s;ed the hem of his
garment, he retired to the &s;table,
where he communicated the&s;e tidings
to his friend Gilbert, whom he &s;addled
and bridled: the &s;ame office he per|formed
for Bronzomarte; then put|ting
on his &s;quire-like attire and ac|coutrements,
he mounted one, and
led the other to the knight's door,
before which he paraded, uttering
from time to time repeated &s;houts, to
the no &s;mall entertainment of the po|pulace,
until he received orders to
hou&s;e his companions. Thus com|manded,
he led them back to their
&s;talls, re&s;umed his livery, and rejoin|ed
his fellow-&s;ervants, who were re|&s;olved
<PB N="244" REF="247">
to celebrate the day with ban|quets
and rejoicings.</P>
<P>Their ma&s;ter's heart was not &s;uffi|ciently
at ea&s;e to &s;hare in their fe&s;tivi|ty.
He held a con&s;ultation with his
friends in the parlour, whom he ac|quainted
with the rea&s;ons he had to
believe Mi&s;s Darnel was confined in
the &s;ame hou&s;e which had been his
pri&s;on: a circum&s;tance which filled
them with equal plea&s;ure and a&s;toni&s;h|ment.
Dolly, in particular, weeping
plentifully, conjured him to deliver
her dear lady without delay. Nothing
now remained but to concert the plan
for her deliverance. As Aurelia had
informed Dolly of her connection
with Mrs. Kawdle, at who&s;e hou&s;e
&s;he propo&s;ed to lodge, before &s;he was
overtaken on the road by her uncle,
this particular was now imparted to
the council, and &s;truck a light which
&s;eemed to point out the direct way to
Mi&s;s Darnel's enlargement.</P>
<P>Our hero, accompanied by Mrs.
Cow&s;lip, and Tom Clarke, &s;et out
immediately for the hou&s;e of Dr.
<PB N="245" REF="248">
Kawdle, who happened to be abroad;
but his wife received them with great
courte&s;y. She was a well-bred, &s;en|&s;ible,
genteel woman, and &s;trongly
attached to Aurelia by the ties of af|fection
as well as of con&s;anguinity.
She no &s;ooner learned the &s;ituation of
her cou&s;in than &s;he expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t
impatient concern for her being &s;et at
liberty; and a&s;&s;ured Sir Launcelot &s;he
would concur in any &s;cheme he &s;hould
propo&s;e for that purpo&s;e. There was
no room for he&s;itation or choice; he
attended her immediately to the
judge, who, upon proper application,
i&s;&s;ued another &s;earch-warrant for Aure|lia
Darnel. The con&s;table and his
po&s;&s;e were again retained; and Sir
Launcelot Greaves once more cro&s;&s;ed
the thre&s;hold of Mr. Bernard Shackle.
Nor was the &s;earch-warrant the only
implement of ju&s;tice with which he
had furni&s;hed him&s;elf for this vi&s;it.
In going thither, they agreed upon
the method in which they &s;hould in|troduce
them&s;elves gradually to Mi&s;s
Darnel, that her tender nature might
<PB N="246" REF="249">
not be too much &s;hocked by their &s;ud|den
appearance.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the hou&s;e
therefore, and produced their creden|tials,
in con&s;equence of which a fe|male
attendant was directed to &s;hew
the lady's apartment, Mrs. Dolly fir&s;t
entered the chamber of the accom|pli&s;hed
Aurelia, who, lifting up her
eyes, &s;creamed aloud, and flew into
the arms of her faithful Cow&s;lip.
Some minutes elap&s;ed before Dolly
could make &s;hift to exclaim,&mdash;&startq;Am
coom to live and daai with my be|loved
leady!&endq; &startq;Dear Dolly! (cried
her mi&s;tre&s;s) I cannot expre&s;s the
plea&s;ure I have in &s;eeing you again&mdash;Good
heaven! what &s;olitary hours of
keen affliction have I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince we
parted!&mdash;but, tell me, how did you
di&s;cover the place of my retreat?&mdash;has
my uncle relented?&mdash;do I owe
your coming to his indulgence?&endq;</P>
<P>Dolly an&s;wered in the negative;
and by degrees gave her to under&s;tand
that her cou&s;in, Mrs. Kawdle, was in
the next room; that lady immediate|ly
<PB N="247" REF="250">
appeared, and a very tender &s;cene
of recognition pa&s;&s;ed between the two
relations. It was &s;he who, in the
cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, perceiving that
Aurelia was perfectly compo&s;ed, de|clared
the happy tidings of the ap|proaching
deliverance. When the
other eagerly in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing
to who&s;e humanity and addre&s;s &s;he
was indebted for this happy turn of
fortune, her cou&s;in declared the obli|gation
was due to a young gentleman
of York&s;hire, called Sir Launcelot
Greaves. At mention of that name,
her face was over&s;pread with a crim|&s;on
glow, and her eyes beamed re|doubled
&s;plendor.&mdash;&startq;Cou&s;in, (&s;aid
&s;he, with a &s;igh) I know not what to
&s;ay&mdash;that gentleman,&mdash;Sir Launce|lot
Greaves was &s;urely born&mdash;Lord
ble&s;s me!&mdash;I tell you, cou&s;in, he has
been my guardian angel.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Kawdle, who had maintained
a corre&s;pondence with her by letters,
was no &s;tranger to the former part of
the connexion &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between tho&s;e
two lovers, and had always favoured
<PB N="248" REF="251">
the preten&s;ions of our hero, without
being acquainted with his per&s;on. She
now ob&s;erved with a &s;mile, that as
Aurelia e&s;teemed the knight her guar|dian
angel, and he adored her as a
demi-deity, nature &s;eemed to have
intended them for each other; for
&s;uch &s;ublime ideas exalted them both
above the &s;phere of ordinary mortals.
She then ventured to intimate that he
was in the hou&s;e, impatient to pay his
re&s;pects in per&s;on. At this declara|tion,
the colour vani&s;hed from her
cheeks; which, however, &s;oon under|went
a total &s;uffu&s;ion. Her heart
panted; her bo&s;om heaved; and her
gentle frame was agitated by tran&s;|ports
rather violent than unplea&s;ing.
She &s;oon, however, recollected her|&s;elf,
and her native &s;erenity return|ed;
when, ri&s;ing from her &s;eat, &s;he
declared &s;he would &s;ee him in the next
apartment, where he &s;tood in the mo&s;t
tumultuous &s;u&s;pence, waiting for per|mi&s;&s;ion
to approach her per&s;on. Here
&s;he broke in upon him, arrayed in an
elegant white undre&s;s, the emblem of
<PB N="249" REF="252">
her purity, beaming forth the emana|tions
of amazing beauty, warmed and
improved with a glow of gratitude and
affection. His heart was too big for
utterance; he ran towards her with
rapture, and, throwing him&s;elf at her
feet, imprinted a re&s;pectful ki&s;s upon
her lilly hand. &startq;This, divine Au|relia,
(cried he) is a foreta&s;te of that
ineffable bli&s;s, which you was born to
be&s;tow!&mdash;Do I then live to &s;ee you
&s;mile again? to &s;ee you re&s;tored to li|berty;
your mind at ea&s;e, and your
health unimpaired!&endq; &startq;You have lived
(&s;aid &s;he) to &s;ee my obligations to Sir
Launcelot Greaves accumulated in
&s;uch a manner, that a whole life &s;pent
in acknowledgment will &s;carce &s;uffice
to demon&s;trate a due &s;en&s;e of his
goodne&s;s.&endq; &startq;You greatly over-rate
my &s;ervices, which have been rather
the duties of common humanity, than
the efforts of a generous pa&s;&s;ion, too
noble to be thus evinced;&mdash;but let
not my un&s;ea&s;onable tran&s;ports detain
you a moment longer on this dete&s;ted
&s;cene&mdash;Give me leave to hand you
into the coach, and commit you to
<PB N="250" REF="253">
the care of this good lady, attended
by this hone&s;t young gentleman, who
is my particular friend.&endq; So &s;aying,
he pre&s;ented Mr. Thomas Clarke,
who had the honour to &s;alute the fair
hand of the ever amiable Aurelia.</P>
<P>The ladies being &s;afely coached un|der
the e&s;corte of the lawyer, Sir
Launcelot a&s;&s;ured them he &s;hould wait
on them in the evening, at the hou&s;e
of Dr. Kawdle, whither they imme|diately
directed their cour&s;e. Our
hero, who remained with the con|&s;table
and his gang, enquired for Mr.
Bernard Shackle, upon who&s;e per&s;on
he intended to &s;erve a writ of con&s;pi|racy,
over and above a pro&s;ecution for
robbery, in con&s;equence of his having
di&s;encumbered the knight of his mo|ney
and other effects, on the fir&s;t
night of his confinement. Mr. Shackle
had di&s;cretion enough to avoid this
encounter, and even to anticipate the
indictment for felony, by directing
one of his &s;ervants to re&s;tore the ca&s;h
and papers, which our adventurer ac|cordingly
received, before he quitted
the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="254">
In the pro&s;ecution of his &s;earch
after Shackle, he chanced to enter
the chamber of the bard, whom he
found in di&s;habille, writing at a ta|ble,
with a bandage over one eye,
and his head covered with a night|cap
of bays. The knight, having
made an apology for his intru&s;ion,
de&s;ired to know if he could be of
any &s;ervice to Mr. Di&s;tich, as he was
now at liberty to u&s;e the little influence
he had, for the relief of his fellow
&s;ufferers.&mdash;The poet having eyed him

a &s;mall di&s;a&s;ter on my left eye, from

The knight declined gratifying him
in the&s;e particulars, which he appre|hended
might be prejudicial to his
health; but offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in
redre&s;&s;ing his grievances, provided he
laboured under any cruel treatment,
or inconvenience. &startq;I comprehend
the full extent of your genero&s;ity:
(replied the &s;atyri&s;t) you are willing to
a&s;&s;i&s;t me in every thing, except the

my former maxim; defy all the world,
and will die hard, even if death &s;hould
be preceded by damnation.&endq;</P>
<P>The knight finding him incorrigible,
left him to the &s;lender chance of be|ing
one day comforted by the dram|bottle;
but re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to
&s;et on foot an accurate inquiry into
the oeconomy and tran&s;actions of this
private inqui&s;ition, that ample ju&s;tice
<PB N="253" REF="256">
might be done in favour of every injur|ed
individual confined within its walls.
In the afternoon, he did not fail to
vi&s;it his Aurelia; and all the prote&s;|tations
of their mutual pa&s;&s;ion were
once more interchanged. He now
produced the letter, which had cau&s;ed
&s;uch fatal di&s;quiet in his bo&s;om; and
Mi&s;s Darnel no &s;ooner eyed the paper,
than &s;he recollected it was a formal
di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, which &s;he had intended
and directed for Mr. Sycamore. This
the uncle had intercepted, and cun|ningly
inclo&s;ed in another cover, ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to Sir Launcelot Greaves, who
was now a&s;toni&s;hed beyond mea&s;ure
to &s;ee the my&s;tery &s;o ea&s;ily unfolded.
The joy that now diffu&s;ed it&s;elf in the
hearts of our lovers, is more ea&s;ily
conceived than de&s;cribed; but, in
order to give a &s;tability to this mutual
&s;atisfaction, it was nece&s;&s;ary that Au|relia
&s;hould be &s;ecured from the ty|ranny
of her uncle, who&s;e power of
guardian&s;hip would not otherwi&s;e for
&s;ome months expire.</P>
<P>Dr. Kawdle and his lady having
<PB N="254" REF="257">
entered into their deliberations on
this &s;ubject, it was agreed that Mi&s;s
Darnel &s;hould have recour&s;e to the
protection of the lord-chancellor: but
&s;uch application was rendered unne|ce&s;&s;ary
by the unexpected arrival of
John Clump with the following letter
to Mrs. Kawdle from the &s;teward of
Anthony Darnel, dated at Aurelia's
hou&s;e in the country. &startq;Madam, it
hath plea&s;ed God to afflict Mr. Darnel
with a &s;evere &s;troke of the dead pal|&s;y.
&mdash;He was taken ye&s;terday, and
now lies in&s;en&s;ible, &s;eemingly at the
point of death. Among the papers
in his pocket, I found the inclo&s;ed,
by which it appears that my honour|ed
young lady Mi&s;s Darnel is confined
in a private mad-hou&s;e. I am afraid
Mr. Darnel's fate is a ju&s;t judgment
of God upon him for his cruelty to
that excellent per&s;on. I need not ex|hort
you, madam, to take, imme|diately
upon the receipt of this, &s;uch
mea&s;ures as will be nece&s;&s;ary for the
enlargement of my poor young lady.
In the mean time, I &s;hall do the need|ful
<PB N="255" REF="258">
for the pre&s;ervation of her property
in this place, and &s;end you an account
of any further alteration that may
happen; being very re&s;pectfully, Ma|dam,
your mo&s;t obedient humble &s;er|vant,
Ralph Mattocks.&endq;</P>
<P>Clump had po&s;ted up to London
with this intimation, on the wings
of love, and being covered with clay
from the heels to the eyes upwards,
he appeared in &s;uch an unfavourable
light at Dr. Kawdle's door, that the
footman refu&s;ed him admittance.
Neverthele&s;s, he pu&s;hed him a&s;ide,
and fought his way up-&s;tairs into the
dining-room, where the company was
not a little a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch an ap|parition.
The fellow him&s;elf was no
le&s;s amazed at &s;eeing Aurelia, and
his own &s;weetheart Mrs. Dolly Cow|&s;lip.
He forthwith fell upon his
knees, and, in &s;ilence, held out the
letter, which was taken by the doctor,
and pre&s;ented to his wife, according
to the direction. She did not fail to
communicate the contents, which were
far from being unwelcome to the in|dividuals
<PB N="256" REF="259">
who compo&s;ed this little &s;o|ciety.
Mr. Clump was honoured
with the approbation of his young la|dy,
who commended him for his zeal
and expedition; be&s;towed upon him
an hand&s;ome gratuity in the mean
time, and de&s;ired to &s;ee him again
when he &s;hould be properly refre&s;hed
after the fatigue he had undergone.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Clarke being con|&s;ulted
on this occa&s;ion, gave it as
his opinion, that Mi&s;s Darnel &s;hould
without delay, choo&s;e another guar|dian
for the few months that remained
of her minority. The opinion was
confirmed by the advice of &s;ome emi|nent
lawyers, to whom immediate re|cour&s;e
was had; and Dr. Kawdle,
being the per&s;on pitched upon for
this office, the nece&s;&s;ary forms were
executed with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.
The fir&s;t u&s;e the doctor made of his
guardian&s;hip was to &s;ign a power, con|&s;tituting
Mr. Ralph Mattocks his at|torney
<HI>pro tempore,</HI> for managing the
e&s;tate of Mi&s;s Aurelia Darnel; and
this was forwarded to the &s;teward by
<PB N="257" REF="260">
the hands of Clump, who &s;et out
with it for the &s;eat of Darnel-hill,
though not without a heavy heart,
occa&s;ioned by &s;ome intimation he had
received, concerning the connexion
between his dear Dolly, and Mr.
Clarke the lawyer.</P>

<P>SIR Launcelot having vindicated
the liberty, confirmed the &s;afety,
and &s;ecured the heart of his charming
Aurelia, now found lei&s;ure to unravel
the con&s;piracy which had been exe|cuted
again&s;t his per&s;on; and with
that view commenced a law-&s;uit
again&s;t the owner of the hou&s;e where
he and his mi&s;tre&s;s had been &s;eparate|ly
confined. Mr. Shackle was, not|with&s;tanding
all the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions and
atonement which he offered to make,
either in private or in public, indicted
on the &s;tatute of kidnapping, tried,
convicted, puni&s;hed by a &s;evere fine,
<PB N="258" REF="261">
and &s;tanding in the pillory. A judi|cial
writ <HI>ad inquirendum</HI> being exe|cuted,
the pri&s;ons of his inqui&s;ition
were laid open, and &s;everal innocent
captives enlarged.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of Shackle's trial, it
appeared that the knight's confine|ment
was a &s;cheme executed by his
rival Mr. Sycamore, according to the
device of his coun&s;ellor Dawdle, who,
by this contrivance, had reconciled
him&s;elf to his patron, after having
de&s;erted him in the day of battle. Our
hero was &s;o incen&s;ed at the di&s;covery
of Sycamore's treachery and ingrati|tude,
that he went in que&s;t of him
immediately, to take vengeance on
his per&s;on, accompanied by captain
Crowe, who wanted to ballance ac|counts
with Mr. Dawdle. But tho&s;e
gentlemen had wi&s;ely avoided the im|pending
&s;torm, by retiring to the con|tinent,
on pretence of travelling for
improvement.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot was not now &s;o much
of a knight-errant, as to leave Aure|lia
to the care of Providence, and pur|&s;ue
<PB N="259" REF="262">
the traitors to the farthe&s;t extre|mities
of the earth. He practi&s;ed a
much more ea&s;y, certain, and effectual
method of revenge, by in&s;tituting a
proce&s;s again&s;t them, which, after
writs of <HI>capias, alias, &amp; pluries,</HI> had
been repeated, &s;ubjected them both
to outlawry. Mr. Sycamore and his
friend being thus deprived of the be|nefit
of the law, by their own neglect,
would likewi&s;e have forfeited their
goods and chattels to the king, had
not they made &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions as ap|pea&s;ed
the wrath of Sir Launcelot and
captain Crowe; then they ventured
to return, and by dint of intere&s;t ob|tained
a rever&s;al of the outlawry. But
this grace they did not enjoy, till long
after our adventurer was happily e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in life.</P>
<P>While the knight waited impatient|ly
for the expiration of Aurelia's mi|nority,
and, in the mean time, con|&s;oled
him&s;elf with the imperfect hap|pine&s;s
ari&s;ing from her conver&s;ation,
and tho&s;e indulgences which the mo&s;t
unblemi&s;hed virtue could be&s;tow;
<PB N="260" REF="263">
captain Crowe projected another plan
of vengeance again&s;t the conjurer,
who&s;e lying oracles had co&s;t him &s;uch
a world of vexation. The truth is,
the captain began to be tired of idle|ne&s;s,
and undertook this adventure to
keep his hand in u&s;e. He imparted
his de&s;ign to Crab&s;haw, who had
likewi&s;e &s;uffered in &s;pirit from the
predictions of the &s;aid offender, and
was extremely well di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t
in puni&s;hing the fal&s;e prophet. He
now took it for granted that he &s;hould
not be hanged for &s;tealing a hor&s;e;
and thought it very hard to pay &s;o
much money for a deceitful prophe|cy,
which, in all likelihood, would
never be fulfilled.</P>
<P>Actuated by the&s;e motives, they
&s;et out together for the hou&s;e of con|&s;ultation;
but they found it &s;hut up
and abandoned, and, upon inquiry in
the neighbourhood, learned that the
conjurer had moved his quarters that
very day on which the captain had
recour&s;e to his art. This was actual|ly
the ca&s;e: he knew the fate of Sir
<PB N="261" REF="264">
Launcelot would &s;oon come to light,
and he did not chu&s;e to wait the con|&s;equence.
He had other motives for
decamping. He had run a &s;core at
the public-hou&s;e, which he had no
mind to di&s;charge, and wanted to di&s;|engage
him&s;elf from his female a&s;&s;o|ciate,
who knew too much of his af|fairs,
to be kept at a proper di&s;tance.
All the&s;e purpo&s;es he had an&s;wered,
by retreating &s;oftly, without beat of
drum, while his Sybil was abroad
running down prey for his devouring.
He had not, however, taken his mea|&s;ures
&s;o cunningly, but that this old
hag di&s;covered his new lodgings, and,
in revenge, gave information to the
publican. This creditor took out a
writ accordingly; and the bailiff had
ju&s;t &s;ecured his per&s;on as Capt. Crowe
and Timothy Crab&s;haw chanced to
pa&s;s by the door in their way home|wards,
through an ob&s;cure &s;treet near
the Seven Dials.</P>
<P>The conjurer having no &s;ubterfuge
left, but a great many particular rea|&s;ons
for avoiding an explanation with
<PB N="262" REF="265">
the ju&s;tice, like the man between
the devil and the deep &s;ea, of
two evils cho&s;e the lea&s;t; and beck|oning
to the captain, called him by
his name. Crowe, thus addre&s;&s;ed,
replied with a &startq;Hilloah!&endq; and look|ing
towards the place from whence he
was hailed, at once recognized the
negromancer. Without farther he|&s;itation
he &s;prang acro&s;s the &s;treet, and
collaring Albumazar, exclaimed, &startq;A|ha!
old boy; is the wind in that cor|ner?
&mdash;I thought we &s;hould grapple
one day&mdash;now will I bring you up
by the head, tho' all the devils in hell
were blowing abaft the beam.&endq;</P>
<P>The bailiff &s;eeing his pri&s;oner &s;o
roughly handled before, and at the
&s;ame time a&s;&s;aulted behind by Crab|&s;haw,
who cried, &startq;Shew me a liar,
and I'll &s;hew you a thief&mdash;who is to
be hanged now?&endq;&mdash;I &s;ay, the bailiff,
fearing he &s;hould lo&s;e the benefit of
his job, began to put on his conten|tious
face, and, declaring the doctor
was his pri&s;oner, &s;wore he could not
&s;urrender him without a warrant from
<PB N="263" REF="266">
the lord chief ju&s;tice. The whole
groupe adjourning into the parlour,
the conjurer de&s;ired to know of Crowe,
whether Sir Launcelot was found? be|ing
an&s;wered, &startq;Ey, ey, &s;afe enough
to &s;ee you made fa&s;t in the bilboes,
brother;&endq; he told the captain he had
&s;omething of con&s;equence to commu|nicate
for his advantage; and propo|&s;ed
that Crowe and Crab&s;haw &s;hould
bail the action, which lay only for a
debt of three pounds.</P>
<P>Crowe &s;tormed, and Crab&s;haw grin|ned
at this mode&s;t propo&s;al: but when
they under&s;tood that they could only
be bound for his appearance, and re|flected
that they needed not part with
him until his body &s;hould be &s;urren|dered
unto ju&s;tice, they con&s;ented to
give bail; and the bond being exe|cuted,
conveyed him directly to the
hou&s;e of our adventurer. The boi&s;|terous
Crowe introduced him to Sir
Launcelot with &s;uch an abrupt un|connected
detail of his offence, as the
knight could not under&s;tand without
Timothy's annotations. The&s;e were
<PB N="264" REF="267">
followed by &s;ome que&s;tions put to the
conjurer, who laying a&s;ide his black
gown, and plucking off his white
beard, exhibited to the a&s;toni&s;hed
&s;pectators the very individual counte|nance
of the empyrical politician Fer|ret,
who had played our hero &s;uch a
&s;lippery trick after the electioneering
adventure.</P>
<P>&startq;I perceive (&s;aid he) you are pre|paring
to expo&s;tulate, and upbraid me
for having given a fal&s;e information
again&s;t you to the country ju&s;tice. I
look upon mankind to be in a &s;tate of
nature, a truth which Hobbes hath
&s;tumbled upon by accident: I think
every man has a right to avail him&s;elf
of his talents, even at the expence of
his fellow-creatures; ju&s;t as we &s;ee
the fi&s;h, and other animals of the crea|tion
devouring one another.&mdash;I found
the ju&s;tice but one degree removed
from ideoti&s;m, and knowing that he
would commit &s;ome blunder in the
execution of his office, which would
lay him at your mercy, I contrived to
make his folly the in&s;trument of my
<PB N="265" REF="268">
e&s;cape&mdash;I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without be|ing
obliged to &s;ign the information I
had given; and you took ample
vengeance for his tyranny and imper|tinence.
I came to London, where my
circum&s;tances obliged me to live in
di&s;gui&s;e. In the character of a con|jurer,
I was con&s;ulted by your fol|lower
Crowe, and your '&s;quire Crab|&s;haw.
I did little or nothing but ec|cho
back the intelligence they brought
me, except progno&s;ticating that Crab|&s;haw
would be hanged; a prediction
to which I found my&s;elf &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly
impelled, that I am per&s;uaded it was
the real effect of in&s;piration&mdash;I am
now arre&s;ted for a paultry &s;um of mo|ney,
and, moreover, liable to be &s;ent
to Bridewell as an impo&s;tor&mdash;let tho&s;e
an&s;wer for my conduct who&s;e cruel|ty
and in&s;olence have driven me to the
nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing &s;uch &s;ubterfuges&mdash;
I have been oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted
by the government for &s;peaking truth
&mdash;your omnipotent laws have recon|ciled
contradictions. That which is
acknowledged to be truth in fact, is
<PB N="266" REF="269">
con&s;trued fal&s;hood in law; and great
rea&s;on we have to boa&s;t of a con&s;titution
founded on the ba&s;is of ab&s;urdity&mdash;
But, waving the&s;e remarks, I own I
am unwilling to be either impri&s;oned
for debt, or puni&s;hed for impo&s;ture&mdash;
I know how far to depend upon ge|nero&s;ity,
and what is called benevo|lence;
words to amu&s;e the weak|minded
&mdash;I build upon a &s;urer bottom
&mdash;I will bargain for your a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;
it is in my power to put twelve thou|&s;and
pounds in the pocket of Samuel
Crowe, that there &s;ea-ruffian, who by
his good will would hang me to the
yard's arm&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>There he was interrupted by the
&s;eaman. &startq;Damn your rat's eyes!
none of your&mdash;hang thee! fi&s;h my
topma&s;ts! if the rope was fairly reeved,
and the tackle &s;ound, d'ye &s;ee&mdash;&endq;
Mr. Clarke, who was pre&s;ent, began
to &s;tare; while the knight a&s;&s;ured
Ferret, that if he was really able and
willing to &s;erve captain Crowe in any
thing e&s;&s;ential, he &s;hould be amply
rewarded. In the mean time, he di&s;|charged
<PB N="267" REF="270">
the debt, and a&s;&s;igned him an
apartment in his own hou&s;e. That
&s;ame day Crowe, by the advice of
Sir Launcelot and his nephew, en|tered
into conditional articles with the
Cynic, to allow him the intere&s;t of
fifteen hundred pounds for life; pro|vided,
by his means, the captain &s;hould
obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate of Hob|by-hole
in York&s;hire, which had be|longed
to his grandfather, and of
which he was heir of blood.</P>
<P>This bond being executed, Mr.
Ferret di&s;covered that he him&s;elf was
the lawful hu&s;band of Bridget Maple,
aunt to Samuel Crowe, by a clande&s;|tine
marriage; which, however, he
convinced them he could prove by un|deniable
evidence. This being the
ca&s;e, &s;he, the &s;aid Bridget Maple, alias
Ferret, was a <HI>covert femme,</HI> con&s;e|quently
could not tran&s;act any deed of
alienation without his concurrence;
ergo, the docking of the intail
of the e&s;tate of Hobby-hole was
illegal and of none effect. This was
a very agreeable declaration to the
<PB N="268" REF="271">
whole company, who did not fail to
congratulate captain Crowe on the
pro&s;pect of his being re&s;tored to his
inheritance. Tom Clarke, in parti|cular,
prote&s;ted, with tears in his
eyes, that it gave him un&s;peakable
joy; and his tears trickled the fa&s;ter,
when Crowe with an arch look &s;igni|fied,
that now he was pretty well vic|tualled
for life, he had &s;ome thoughts
of embarking on the voyage of matri|mony.</P>
<P>But that point of happine&s;s to which,
as the north pole, the cour&s;e of the&s;e
adventures hath been invariably direc|ted,
was &s;till unattained; we mean,
the indi&s;&s;oluble union of the accom|pli&s;hed
Sir Launcelot Greaves and the
enchanting Mi&s;s Darnel. Our hero
now di&s;covered in his mi&s;tre&s;s a thou|&s;and
charms, which hitherto he had
no opportunity to contemplate. He
found her beauty excelled by her good
&s;en&s;e, and her virtue &s;uperior to both.
He found her untainted by that gid|dine&s;s,
vanity, and affectation, which
di&s;tingui&s;h the fa&s;hionable females of
<PB N="269" REF="272">
the pre&s;ent age. He found her un|infected
by the rage for diver&s;ion and
di&s;&s;ipation; for noi&s;e, tumult, gew|gaws,
glitter, and extravagance. He
found her not only rai&s;ed by under|&s;tanding
and ta&s;te far above the amu&s;e|ments
of little vulgar minds; but
even exalted by uncommon genius
and refined reflection, &s;o as to reli&s;h
the more &s;ublime enjoyments of ra|tional
plea&s;ure. He found her po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of that vigour of mind which
con&s;titutes true fortitude, and vindi|cates
the empire of rea&s;on. He found
her heart incapable of di&s;gui&s;e or di&s;|&s;imulation;
frank, generous, and
open; &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t tender
impre&s;&s;ions; glowing with a keen
&s;en&s;e of honour, and melting with
humanity. A youth of his &s;en&s;ibility
could not fail of being deeply affected
by &s;uch attractions. The nearer he
approached the center of happine&s;s,
the more did the velocity of his pa&s;|&s;ion
increa&s;e. Her uncle &s;till remain|ed
in&s;en&s;ible, as it were, in the arms
of death. Time &s;eemed to linger in
<PB N="270" REF="273">
its lap&s;e, 'till the knight was inflamed
to the mo&s;t eager degree of impa|tience.
He communicated his di&s;tre&s;s
to Aurelia; he pre&s;&s;ed, her with the
mo&s;t pathetic remon&s;trances to abridge
the torture of his &s;u&s;pence. He in|tere&s;ted
Mrs. Kawdle in his behalf;
and, at length, his importunity &s;uc|ceeded.
The banns of marriage were
regularly publi&s;hed, and the ceremony
was performed in the pari&s;h church,
in the pre&s;ence of Dr. Kawdle and his
lady, captain Crowe, lawyer Clarke,
and Mr. Dolly Cow&s;lip.</P>
<P>The bride, in&s;tead of being di&s;gui|&s;ed
in tawdry &s;tuffs of gold or &s;ilver,
and &s;weating under a harne&s;s of dia|monds,
according to the elegant ta&s;te
of the times, appeared in a negligee
of plain blue &s;attin, without any other
jewels than her eyes, which far out|&s;hone
all that ever was produced by
the mines of Golconda. Her hair had
no other extraneous ornament than a
&s;mall &s;prig of artificial ro&s;es; but the
dignity of her air, the elegance of her
&s;hape, the &s;weetne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of
<PB N="271" REF="274">
her countenance, added to &s;uch
warmth of colouring, and &s;uch ex|qui&s;ite
&s;ymmetry of features, as could
not be excelled by human nature, at|tracted
the eyes and excited the ad|miration
of all the beholders. The
effect they produced in the heart of
Sir Launcelot, was &s;uch a rapture as
we cannot pretend to de&s;cribe. He
made his appearance on this occa&s;ion,
in a white coat and blue &s;attin ve&s;t,
both embroidered with &s;ilver; and all
who &s;aw him could not but own that
he alone &s;eemed worthy to po&s;&s;e&s;s the
lady whom heaven had de&s;tined for
his con&s;ort. Captain Crowe had taken
off a blue &s;uit of cloaths &s;trongly
guarded with bars of broad gold lace,
in order to honour the nuptials of his
friend: he wore upon his head a bag|wig
<HI>a la pigeon,</HI> made by an old ac|quaintance
in Wapping; and to his
&s;ide he had girded a huge plate-hilt|ed
&s;word, which he had bought of a
recruiting &s;erjeant. Mr. Clarke was
dre&s;&s;ed in pompadour, with gold but|tons,
and his lovely Dolly in a &s;mart
<PB N="272" REF="275">
checked lute&s;tring, a pre&s;ent from her
mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The whole company dined, by in|vitation,
at the hou&s;e of Dr. Kawdle,
and here it was that the two mo&s;t de|&s;erving
lovers on the face of the earth
attained to the con&s;ummation of all
earthly felicity. The captain and his
nephew had a hint to retire in due
time. Mrs. Kawdle conducted the
amiable Aurelia, trembling, to the
marriage-bed: our hero glowing with
a bridegroom's ardour, claimed the
hu&s;band's privilege: Hymen lighted
up his brighte&s;t torch at virtue's lamp,
and every &s;tar &s;hed its happie&s;t in|fluence
on their heaven-directed union.
In&s;tructions had been already di&s;patch|ed
to prepare Greave&s;bury-hall for the
reception of its new mi&s;tre&s;s; and for
that place the new-married couple &s;et
out next morning, according to the
plan which had been previou&s;ly con|certed.
Sir Launcelot and lady
Greaves, accompanied by Mrs. Kaw|dle,
and attended by Dolly, travelled
in their own coach drawn by &s;ix dap|pled
<PB N="273" REF="276">
hor&s;es. Dr. Kawdle, with cap|tain
Crowe, occupied the doctor's po&s;t|chariot,
provided with four bays: Mr.
Clark had the honour to be&s;tride the
loins of Bronzomarte: Mr. Ferret
was mounted upon an old hunter:
Crab&s;haw &s;tuck clo&s;e to his friend
Gilbert; and two other hor&s;emen
completed the retinue. There was not
an aching heart in the whole cavalcade,
except that of the young lawyer, which
was by turns invaded with hot de&s;ires
and chilling &s;cruples. Though he
was fond of Dolly to di&s;traction, his
regard to worldly reputation, and his
attention to worldly intere&s;t, were con|tinually
rai&s;ing up bars to a legal gra|tification
of his love. His pride was
&s;tartled at the thought of marrying the
daughter of a poor country publican;
and he moreover dreaded the re&s;ent|ment
of his uncle Crowe, &s;hould he
take any &s;tep of this nature without
his concurrence. Many a wi&s;hful
look did he ca&s;t at Dolly, the tears
&s;tanding in his eyes; and many a
woeful &s;igh did he utter.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="277">
Lady Greaves immediately per|ceived
the &s;ituation of his heart, and,
by que&s;tioning Mrs. Cow&s;lip, di&s;co|vered
a mutual pa&s;&s;ion between the&s;e
lovers. She con&s;ulted her dear knight
on the &s;ubject; and he catechi&s;ed the
lawyer, who pleaded guilty. The cap|tain
being &s;ounded, as to his opinion,
declared he would be &s;teered in that
as well as every other cour&s;e of life,
by Sir Launcelot and his lady, whom
he verily revered as beings of an order
&s;uperior to the ordinary race of man|kind.
This favourable re&s;pon&s;e being
obtained from the &s;ailor, our hero
took an opportunity on the road, one
day after dinner, in pre&s;ence of the
whole company, to acco&s;t the lawyer
in the&s;e words: &startq;My good friend
Clarke, I have your happine&s;s very
much at heart&mdash;your father was an
hone&s;t man, to whom my family had
manifold obligations. I have had
the&s;e many years a per&s;onal regard for
your&s;elf, derived from your own in|tegrity
of heart and goodne&s;s of di&s;|po&s;ition
&mdash;I &s;ee you are affected, and
<PB N="275" REF="278">
&s;hall be brief&mdash;Be&s;ides this regard, I
am indebted to your friend&s;hip for the
liberty&mdash;what &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;for the
ine&s;timable happine&s;s I now enjoy, in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t excellent&mdash;But I
under&s;tand that &s;ignificant glance of
my Aurelia&mdash;I will not offend her
delicacy&mdash;The truth is, my obligation
is very great, and it is time I &s;hould
evince my gratitude&mdash;If the &s;teward|&s;hip
of my e&s;tate is worth your ac|ceptance,
you &s;hall have it immediate|ly,
together with the hou&s;e and farm
of Cockerton in my neighbourhood.
I know you have a pa&s;&s;ion for Mrs.
Dolly; and believe &s;he looks upon
you with the eyes of tender prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
&mdash;don't blu&s;h Dolly,&mdash;be&s;ides
your agreeable per&s;on, which all the
world mu&s;t approve, you can boa&s;t of
virtue, fidelity, and friend&s;hip. Your
attachment to lady Greaves neither
&s;he or I &s;hall ever forget&mdash;if you are
willing to unite your fate with Mr.
Clarke, your mi&s;tre&s;s gives me leave
to a&s;&s;ure you &s;he will &s;tock the farm
at her own expence; and we will ce|lebrate
<PB N="276" REF="279">
the wedding at Greave&s;bury-hall&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>By this time the hearts of the&s;e
grateful lovers had overflowed. Dol|ly
was &s;itting on her knees, bathing
her lady's hand with her tears; and
Mr. Clarke appeared in the &s;ame atti|tude
by Sir Launcelot. The uncle, al|mo&s;t
as much affected as the nephew,
by the genero&s;ity of our adventurer,
cried aloud, &startq;I pray God that you
and your glorious con&s;ort may have
&s;mooth &s;eas and gentle gales whither|&s;oever
you are bound&mdash;as for my
kin&s;man Tom, I'll give him a thou|&s;and
pounds, to &s;et him fairly afloat;
and if he prove not a faithful tender
to you his benefactor, I hope he will
founder in this world, and be damned
in that which is to come.&endq; Nothing
now was wanting to the completion
of their happine&s;s, but the con&s;ent of
Dolly's mother, at the Black Lyon,
who they did not &s;uppo&s;e could have
any objection to &s;uch an advantageous
match for her daughter: but in this
particular they were mi&s;taken.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="280">
In the mean time, they arrived at
the village where the knight had ex|erci&s;ed
the duties of chivalry; and
there he received the gratulation of
Mr. Fillet, and the attorney who
had offered to bail him before ju&s;tice
Gobble. Mutual civilities having pa&s;|&s;ed,
they gave him to uuder&s;tand, that
Gobble and his wife were turned me|thodi&s;ts.
All the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners
whom he had delivered came to te&s;ti|fy
their gratitude, and were ho&s;pita|bly
entertained. Next day they halt|ed
at the Black Lyon, where the good
woman was overjoyed to &s;ee Dolly &s;o
happily preferred: but when Sir
Launcelot unfolded the propo&s;ed mar|riage,
&s;he interrupted him with a
&s;cream. &startq;Chri&s;t Je&s;us forbid&mdash;mar|ry
and amen! match with her own
brother!&endq;</P>
<P>At this exclamation Dolly fainted:
her lover &s;tood with his ears erect, and
his mouth wide open; Crowe &s;tared;
while the knight and his lady expre&s;|&s;ed
equal &s;urprize and concern. When
Sir Launcelot intreated Mrs. Cow&s;lip
<PB N="278" REF="281">
to explain this my&s;tery, &s;he told him
that about &s;ixteen years ago, Mr.
Clarke &s;enior had brought Dolly, then
an infant, to her hou&s;e, when &s;he and
her late hu&s;band lived in another part
of the country; and as &s;he had
then been lately delivered of a child
which did not live, he hired her as
nur&s;e to the little foundling. He
owned &s;he was a love-begotten babe,
and from time to time paid hand&s;ome|ly
for the board of Dolly, who he de|&s;ired
might pa&s;s for her own daugh|ter.
In his la&s;t illne&s;s, he a&s;&s;ured her
he had taken care to provide for the
child; but &s;ince his death &s;he had re|ceived
no account of any &s;uch provi|&s;ion.
She, moreover, informed his
honour, that Mr. Clarke had depo&s;i|ted
in her hands a diamond ring and
a &s;ealed paper, never to be opened
without his order, until Dolly &s;hould
be demanded in marriage by the man
&s;he &s;hould like; and not then, except
in pre&s;ence of the clergyman of the
pari&s;h. &startq;Send for the clergyman this
in&s;tant, (cried our hero, reddening,
<PB N="279" REF="282">
and fixing his eyes on Dolly) I hope
all will yet be well.&endq;</P>
<P>The vicar arriving, and being made
acquainted with the nature of the
ca&s;e, the landlady produced the pa|per;
which being opened, appeared
to be an authentic certificate, that the
per&s;on, commonly known by the
name of Dorothy Cow&s;lip, was in fact
Dorothea Greaves, daughter of Jona|than
Greaves, e&s;&abque; by a young gentle|woman
who had been &s;ome years de|cea&s;ed.&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;The remaining part of the my&s;|tery
I my&s;elf can un&s;old&mdash;(exclaimed
the knight, while he ran and em|braced
the a&s;toni&s;hed Dolly, as his
kin&s;woman.) Jonathan Greaves was
my uncle, and died before he came
of age; &s;o that he could make no
&s;ettlement on his child, the fruit of a
private amour founded on a promi&s;e
of marriage, of which this ring was
a token. Mr. Clarke, being his con|fident,
di&s;po&s;ed of the child, and at
length finding his con&s;titution decay,
revealed the &s;ecret to my father, who,
<PB N="280" REF="283">
in his will, bequeathed one hundred
pounds a year to this agreeable found|ling:
but as they both died while I
was abroad, and &s;ome of the memo|randums
touching this tran&s;action pro|bably
were mi&s;laid, I never till now
could di&s;cover where or how my
pretty cou&s;in was &s;ituated. I &s;hall
recompence the good woman for her
care and fidelity, and take plea&s;ure
in bringing this affair to a happy i&s;|&s;ue.&endq;</P>
<P>The lovers were now overwhelm|ed
with tran&s;ports of joy and grati|tude,
and every countenance was
lighted up with &s;atisfaction. From
this place to the habitation of Sir
Launcelot the bells were rung in
every pari&s;h, and the corporation in
their formalities congratulated him in
every town through which he pa&s;&s;ed.
About five miles from Greave&s;bury-hall
he was met by above five thou|&s;and
per&s;ons of both &s;exes and every
age, dre&s;&s;ed out in their gaye&s;t appa|rel,
headed by Mr. Ralph Mattox
from Darnel-hill, and the rector from
<PB N="281" REF="284">
the knight's own pari&s;h. They were
preceded by mu&s;ic of different kinds,
ranged under a great variety of flags
and en&s;igns; and the women, as well sa
the men, bedizened with fancy-knots
and marriage-favours. At the end of
the avenue, a &s;elect bevy of comely
virgins arrayed in white, and a &s;epa|rate
band of choice youths, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by garlands of laurel and hol|ly
interweaved, fell into the proce&s;|&s;ion,
and &s;ung in chorus a ru&s;tic epi|thalamium
compo&s;ed by the curate.
At the gate they were received by the
venerable hou&s;e-keeper Mrs. Oakley,
who&s;e features were &s;o brightened by
the occa&s;ion, that with the fir&s;t glance
&s;he made a conque&s;t of the heart of
captain Crowe; and this connexion
was improved afterwards into a legal
conjunction.</P>
<P>Mean while the hou&s;es of Greave&s;|bury-hall
and Darnel-hill were &s;et
open for the entertainment of all
comers, and both ecchoed with the
&s;ounds of fe&s;tivity. After the cere|mony
of giving and receiving vi&s;its
<PB N="282" REF="285">
had been performed by Sir Launcelot
Greaves and his lady, Mr. Clarke
was honoured with the hand of the
agreeable Mi&s;s Dolly Greaves; and
the captain was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
his paternal e&s;tate. The perfect and
uninterrupted felicity of the knight
and his endearing con&s;ort, diffu&s;ed it|&s;elf
through the whole adjacent coun|try,
as far as their example and influ|ence
could extend. They were ad|mired,
e&s;teemed, and applauded by
every per&s;on of ta&s;te, &s;entiment, and
benevolence; at the &s;ame time be|loved,
revered, and almo&s;t adored by
the commom people, among whom
they &s;uffered not the mercile&s;s hand
of indigence or mi&s;ery to &s;eize one
&s;ingle &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Ferret, at fir&s;t, &s;eemed to enjoy his
ea&s;y circum&s;tances; but the novelty
of this &s;ituation &s;oon wore off, and all
his mi&s;anthropy returned. He could
not bear to &s;ee his fellow-creatures
happy around him; and &s;ignified his
di&s;gu&s;t to Sir Launcelot, declaring his
intention of returning to the metropo|lis,
<PB N="283" REF="286">
where he knew there would be
always food &s;ufficient for the ravenous
appetite of his &s;pleen. Before he de|parted,
the knight made him partake
of his bounty, though he could not
make him ta&s;te of his happine&s;s,
which &s;oon received a con&s;iderable
addition in the birth of a &s;on, de&s;tin|ed
to be the heir and repre&s;entative
of two worthy families, who&s;e mu|tual
animo&s;ity the union of his pa|rents
had &s;o happily extingui&s;hed.</P>
