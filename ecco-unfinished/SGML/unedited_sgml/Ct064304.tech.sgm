<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS there is nothing more Fanta&s;tical than
to Refine and Sublimate Honour, &s;uch
an airy Nicety, that the lea&s;t Puff of
incon&s;iderate Breath can either blow
or bla&s;t it; &s;o nothing can be more Degenerous in
rea&s;onable Man, the vi&s;ible Image of his Maker,
and Prince of Sublunary Creatures, than in a Bea&s;t|ly
manner to Gore, Kill, and De&s;troy his Fellow-Creature,
for a Thing that hath no Sub&s;i&s;tence,
but in the vain Imagination of a Whim&s;ical Mind;
and no kind of Countenance in tho&s;e Parts of the
World where Civility and Religion have been
Cultivated. Neverthele&s;s, during the League and
Civil Wars of <HI>France,</HI> the over-weaning Heat of
that People, brought in vogue among&s;t them&s;elves,
and by a pernicious Contagion propagated among&s;t
<PB REF="3">
their Neighbours, who were &s;illy enough to ape
them, the Inhuman and Barbarous Practice of
Fighting and Murdering one another in cold Blood,
for the lea&s;t Ruffle of a Chimerical Point of Ho|nour,
which, in Rea&s;on, ought to be manfully &s;light|ed,
rather than meanly re&s;ented, &s;ince real Injuries
are &s;ufficiently provided again&s;t by Laws. And this
Horrid Cu&s;tom growing &s;o common, that &s;carcely
was he looked upon as a Gentleman of Honour,
but he that had Killed or Fought his Man. The
Inconveniencies thereof were &s;o many, and &s;o de|plorable,
and yet &s;o hard to be remedied, that
for many Years, and during &s;everal Princes Reigns,
no one Thing more employed the Cares of the Go|vernment,
both Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, than the
Rooting out of this Unchri&s;tian and Inhuman Cu|&s;tom,
and that very early, as appears by that Ex|cellent
Edict of King <HI>Pharemond</HI>'s, in the Year
440, which we &s;hall here in&s;ert.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Pharamond's Edict again&s;t DUELS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Pharamond, King of the Gauls, to all his Loving
Subjects &s;endeth Greeting.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas it has come to our Royal Notice and
Ob&s;ervation, that in Contempt of all Laws,
Divine and Human, it is of late become a Cu&s;tom
among the Nobility and Gentry of this our Kingdom,
upon &s;light and trivial, as well as great and urgent,
Provocations, to invite each other into the Field,
there by their own Hands, and of their own Autho|rity,
to decide their Controver&s;ies by Combat, we
have thought fit to take the &s;aid Cu&s;tom into our
Royal Con&s;ideration, and find, upon Enquiry into
the u&s;ual Cau&s;es whereon &s;uch Fatal Deci&s;ions have
<PB REF="4">
ari&s;en, that by this wicked C$&s;tom, maugre all the
Precepts of our Holy Religion, and the Rules of
Right Rea&s;on, the greate&s;t Act of the Human Mind,
<HI>Forgivene&s;s of Injuries,</HI> is become vile and &s;hameful;
that the Rules of Good Society and Virtueus Con|ver&s;ation
are hereby inverted; that the Loo&s;e, the
Vain, and the Impudent, in&s;ult the Careful, the
Di&s;creet, and the Mode&s;t; that all Virtue is &s;up|pre&s;s'd,
and all Vice &s;upported, in the one Act of
being capable to dare to the Death. We have al&s;o
farther, with great Sorrow of Mind, ob&s;erv'd that
this dreadful Action, by long Impunity, (our Royal At|tention
being employed upon Matters of more general
Concern,) is become Honourable, and the Refu&s;al to
engage in it Ignominious. In the&s;e our Royal Cares
and Enquiries we are yet farther made to under&s;tand,
that the Per&s;ons of mo&s;t Eminent Worth, and mo&s;t
Hopeful Abilities, accompanied with the &s;tronge&s;t
Pa&s;&s;ion for true Glory, are &s;uch as are mo&s;t liable to
be involved in the Dangers ari&s;ing from this Licence.
Now taking the &s;aid Premi&s;es into our &s;erious Con|&s;ideration,
and well weighing that all &s;uch Emer|gencies,
(wherein the Mind is incapable of com|manding
it&s;elf, and where the Injury is too &s;udden
or too exqui&s;ite to be borne,) are particularly pro|vided
for by Laws hereto&s;ore enacted; and that the
Qualities of le&s;s Injuries, like tho&s;e of Ingratitude,
are too Nice and Delicate to come under General
Rules. We do re&s;olve to blot this Fa&s;hion, or Wan|$onne&s;s
of Anger, out of the Minds of our Subjects,
by our Royal Re&s;olutions declar'd in this Edict, as
$ollow.</P>
<P>No Per&s;on, who either Sends or Accepts a Chal|lenge,
or the Po&s;terity of either, tho' no Death en|$ues
thereupon, &s;hall be, after the Publication of
<PB REF="5">
this our Edict, capable of bearing Office in the&s;e
our Dominions.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on who &s;hall prove the Sending or Re|ceiving
a Challenge, &s;hall receive, to his own U&s;e
and Property, the whole Per&s;onal E&s;tate of both
Parties; and their Real E&s;tate &s;hall be immediately
ve&s;ted in the next Heir of the Offenders, in as
Ample Manner as if the &s;aid Offenders were actual|ly
Decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In Ca&s;es where the Laws (which we have already
granted to our Subjects) admit of an Appeal for
Blood, when the Criminal is condemned by the &s;aid
Appeal, he &s;hall not only &s;uffer Death, but his
whole E&s;tate, Real, Mixed and Per&s;onal, &s;hall
from the Hour of his Death be ve&s;ted in the next
Heir of the Per&s;on who&s;e Blood he &s;pilt.</P>
<P>That it &s;hall not hereafter be in our Royal Power,
or that of our Succe&s;&s;ors, to pardon the &s;aid Offences,
or re&s;tore the Offenders in their E&s;tates, Honour,
or Blood, for ever.</P>

8th of <HI>February,</HI> 420, in the
Second Year of our Reign.</CLOSER>

<P>Indeed, he who will take the Pains to peru&s;e the
many reiterated Edicts, Declarations and Decrees,
of the Kings and Parliaments of <HI>France,</HI> that are
to be found in the Collection of them, and con&s;i|der
how Pathetically they are Worded, mu&s;t needs
confe&s;s that that Government had hard Struglings
to make the Honour of the <HI>French</HI> Gentry &s;leep in
a whole Skin; and that the Supream Authority
of that Nation was never more audaciou&s;ly &s;light|ed,
than in the Particular of Duels.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
The De&s;ign then of the following Book is to
&s;hew the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader what Care the Govern|ment
of <HI>France,</HI> ju&s;tly offended at &s;o intolerable a
Cu&s;tom, took to Repre&s;s it; what Laws were
Made, and &s;trictly put in Execution, again&s;t it; and
by Con&s;equent, to Convince him how Nece&s;&s;ary
the &s;ame Cour&s;e would be in this Nation where
the &s;ame offen&s;ive Weed hath taken &s;uch deep
Rooting: But becau&s;e the Compiler thereof hath
thought it &s;ufficient to Tran&s;late only &s;ome Acts
and Ordinances of the pre&s;ent <HI>French</HI> King's Reign,
as Virtually and Eminently comprehending all the
former Laws made again&s;t Duelling, for the Sa|tisfaction
of the Reader it hath been judged Per|tinent
to Premi&s;e, by Way of Preface, a &s;hort Ab|&s;tract,
and the Dates of the chief Edicts and De|crees
made for the &s;ame Effect, in the Reigns of
his Father and Grandfather, that in the Series of
the Remedies he may ob&s;erve the Progre&s;s and
Continuance of the Evil, which is now at length
much Abated, if not wholly Cured.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Duels,
the Parliament of <HI>Paris, June</HI> 26. 1599, De|clares
all tho&s;e who Revenge them&s;elves of Inju|ries
and Affronts by any other Way than the or|dinary
Cour&s;e of Law, guilty of High Trea&s;on;
ordering the E&s;tates, as well Per&s;onal as Real, both
of the Living and Dead, who have &s;o Offended,
Confi&s;cated to the King; and all who have any
way A&s;&s;i&s;ted, or been pre&s;ent at Duels, or Meet|ings
held for &s;uch Unlawful Pro&s;ecution of Quar|rels,
Rebels to his Maje&s;ty, Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the
Law, and Di&s;turbers of the Publick Peace. In Con|&s;equence
whereof, <HI>Henry</HI> IV. by his Edict at <HI>Blois</HI>
of <HI>April</HI> 1602, mentioning, That the Di&s;orders of
that Abominable Cu&s;tom of Fighting Duels for Re|paration
<PB REF="7">
of Honour were &s;o great, and &s;o much
Chri&s;tian Blood &s;pilt thereby, that he could not
judge him&s;elf worrhy of Swaying the Scepter if he
did not put a Stop to that Abu&s;e, Declares in Con|formity
to the former Decree of Parliament, all
who have Fought Duels, whether they be Dead or
Alive, Guilty of Trea&s;on; and Orders their Per&s;ons
and E&s;tates to be accordingly proceeded again&s;t,
with Power and Injunction to the Con&s;table and
Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> the Governours and Lieutenant.
Generals of Provinces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to give &s;uch Reparation
to the Parties injured in Honour, as may both pre|vent
the Unlawful Effu&s;ion of Blood, and &s;ave the
Reputation of Gentlemen: To which, as all His
Maje&s;ty's Subjects were to render punctual Obedi|ence,
&s;o the Puni&s;hment again&s;t the Di&s;obedient
and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ois were no ways to be Remitted
nor Moderated.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Severity of all preceding
Edicts, &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were the <HI>French</HI> with the Fal&s;e
Opinion, that their Injured Honour could not be
Repaired but by the Unlawful Way of Duelling,
that the &s;ame King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. in his Edict at
<HI>Fountaine Blean</HI> of <HI>June</HI> 1609, Regretting that
the Rigour of the Law did rather Exa&s;perate than
Repre&s;s that In&s;olent and Bruti&s;h Cu&s;tom, confirms
and enlarges his former Edict, and be&s;ides the Pe|nalties
above impo&s;ed, Ordains Puni&s;hments for
all that any way are concerned in Duelling, not
only the Principals, Seconds, and Carriers of Chal|lenges,
or Offen&s;ive and Provoking Words, but for
&s;uch as come to the Place a&s;&s;igned as Spectators,
without Intention of Fighting; nay, and for tho&s;e
al&s;o, who, coming accidentally, do not endeavour
to prevent the Effu&s;ion of Blood; and that by Death,
Confi&s;cation of Goods, Lo&s;s or Su&s;pen&s;ion of Pla|ces,
<PB REF="8">
Fines, Impri&s;onment, Degradation from Ho|nour
and Infamy, according to the Share and Con|cern
they have had in the Quarrels; Dedicating
to the Poor, Pious and Religious U&s;es, all the Con|fi&s;cated
E&s;tates and Fines that fell to the Crown
by &s;uch Mi&s;demeanours, and Declaring and Pro|te&s;ting
before God, That he will never Pardon any,
who &s;hall be found Guilty of the Violation of that
Edict; and Prohibiting the Queen, Princes of the
Blood, and all Courtiers who&s;oever, to intercede
for them, upon Pain of his Di&s;plea&s;ure. However,
that he might in &s;ome Mea&s;ure comply with a Per|nicious
Humour, that &s;eemed Incorporated into the
Temper of the <HI>French</HI> Nobility and Gentry, he gives
leave to tho&s;e who &s;hould imagine them&s;elves In|jured
and Affronted beyond the Satisfaction that
might be granted them by the ordinary Cour&s;e of
Law, to make their Application to him&s;elf, or to
the Con&s;table, Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> Governours of
Provinces, Lieutenant Generals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and according
to the Nature of the Affront he Promi&s;es to allow
them the Combat, if no other Satisfaction can be
&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>The &s;trict Execution of the&s;e Laws having, du|ring
the re&s;t of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. put &s;ome
Stop to the In&s;olent and Bold Way of Fighting upon
Challenges, in the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Louis</HI>
XIII. to Elude the Force of the former Edicts, a
new Way of Fighting was Introduced, as upon ac|cidental
Rencounters, pretending no Challenge to
have preceded. This gave Occa&s;ion to the &s;aid
King by his Declaration at <HI>Paris</HI> of the fir&s;t of
<HI>July</HI> 1611, not only to Revive and Confirm the
former Edicts of his Father, but al&s;o to extend
the Force of the &s;ame to Rencounters, if it could
be made out that any Quarrel, by Word or Deed,
<PB REF="9">
pa&s;t before betwixt Parties &s;o engaging: Which he
afterward Confirmed and Enlarged by his Declarati|on
at <HI>Paris</HI> of the 18th of <HI>January</HI> 1613, wherein
to cut off all Hopes of Impunity from tho&s;e who
&s;hould fall into &s;uch Offences, having enjoined a
&s;trict and rigorous Execution of all former Edicts,
he Declares, That who&s;oever &s;hall dare to make
Application to Him, or to his Mother, the Queen
Regent, to Mediate and Intercede for Pardons for
&s;uch Offenders, &s;hall Incur his Indignation; and
that who&s;oever &s;hall Conceal or Entertain &s;uch
Criminals, and not Inform again&s;t them, &s;hall be
Reputed and Puni&s;hed as Acce&s;&s;ary to the Crimes;
declaring al&s;o, that if Parties Offended in Honour
do not within a Month after the Injury or Affront
received, make their Complaints to the Con&s;tables,
Mar&s;hals, and the other Judges of Honour appointed
by the aforementioned Edicts, they &s;hall not be
heard for any Reparation by them, but mu&s;t take
their Cour&s;e at Common Law. And the Parliament
of <HI>Paris,</HI> at the Motion of the King's Attorney-General,
upon Occa&s;ion of frequent Duelings in the
Streets of that City, on the 27th of <HI>January,</HI> 1614,
Ratified the &s;ame Declaration, commanding the
Punctual Execution of the &s;ame, by the Officers of
Civil Ju&s;tice, and exhorting all Bi&s;hops and Pre|lates,
according to the Edicts, to deny Chri&s;tian
Burial to tho&s;e that &s;hould be Killed in &s;uch Ren|counters.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the &s;ame <HI>Louis</HI> XIII. of Age,
but upon Complaint made to him, that among&s;t
other Abu&s;es, that of Duelling and Fighting upon
Rencounters was &s;till ob&s;tinately practi&s;ed, not|with&s;tanding
the Severity of the Laws, he i&s;&s;ued
out a Declaration of the Fir&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> 1614,
which the Day following he him&s;elf &s;itting on
<PB REF="10">
his Throne in Parliament, was there ratified,
whereby he confirmed all former Laws made a|gain&s;t
that Crime, enjoined a &s;trict Pro&s;ecution
of the Guilty, and &s;olemnly promi&s;ed not to Par|don
&s;uch Offenders, upon any Interce&s;&s;ion, Account
or Pretext, what&s;oever. All this neverthele&s;s was
not &s;u&s;&s;icient to cool the <HI>French</HI> Blood, for Duel|ling
&s;till continued; &s;o that <HI>July</HI> 14, 1617, the
King publi&s;hed another Edict verified in Parliament,
wherein after a Chri&s;tian Preamble concerning the
Horridne&s;s of that Dete&s;table Crime, he not only
revives all former Laws made again&s;t it, and &s;olemn|ly
Swears never to Pardon any of what Quality
&s;oever that &s;hall be guilty of the &s;ame, but al&s;o
enjoins all Judges and Courts of Ju&s;tice not to have
Re&s;pect to any &s;uch Pardons or Remi&s;&s;ions pre&s;ent|ed
to them, as being contrary to his Maje&s;ty's
Will and Plea&s;ure, and appoints Part of the E&s;tates
Confi&s;cated for the&s;e Crimes to be given to In|formers,
to encourage them to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame;
the re&s;t, as before, being allotted for Pious U&s;es.
And this Edict was in <HI>March,</HI> 1621, put rigorou&s;ly
in Execution by the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> who Con|demned
Five Per&s;ons Guilty of that Crime of
High Trea&s;on, Adjudged their E&s;tates For&s;eited,
and them&s;elves to be Hanged in Per&s;on, if Appre|hended;
and if not, in Effigie, in the Publick Place
of Execution in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>By another Edict of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1623, publi&s;hed in
Parliament the 29th of the &s;ame Month, be&s;ides the
Confirmation of all former Edicts concerning Duels,
it is ordered, That whatever Per&s;on, whether Gentle|man,
Servant or Lackey, &s;hall carry a Challenge,
by Word or Writing, &s;hall without Mercy be put
to Death. In pur&s;uance of which, and all the
former Edicts, <HI>April</HI> 24, 1624, the Parliament
<PB REF="11">
of <HI>Paris</HI> condemned <HI>Bouteville,</HI> Count of <HI>Pontgi|bault,</HI>
the Baron of <HI>C$antail</HI> and <HI>des Salles,</HI> for
having fought a Duel on <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI>-Day, of High
Trea&s;on, and &s;entenced them to be degraded from
all Priviledges of Honour, and declared Ignoble
and Infamous, them&s;elves Hanged on a Gibbet in
the Place of Execution in <HI>Paris,</HI> and their Dead
Bodies carried to <HI>Montfaulcon,</HI> if apprehended;
and if not, Hanged in Effigie upon a Gallows in
the &s;ame Place; all their Hou&s;es razed and de|moli&s;hed,
never again to be rebuilt, and the Trees
growing about them lopt off by the Middle, to
remain as a perpetual Monument of their Crime;
a Pillar of Free-&s;tone, with an In&s;cription in a
Copper-Plate be erected in the Places, containing
the Cau&s;es of that Demolition, and their E&s;tates
Per&s;onal and Real Confi&s;cated. And that this
Sentence might the more effectually be put in
Execution, his Maje&s;ty by bis Edict of the 24th of
<HI>June,</HI> 1624, prohibits all Princes, Lords, and
Gentlemen, of what Quality &s;oever, to favour, a&s;&s;i&s;t,
or entertain, the Violaters of his Edicts in the Mat|ter
of Duels, and all Vicars and Curats to give
them Chri&s;tial Burial: According to which it
was Decreed in Parliament upon Occa&s;ion of ano|ther
Duel Fought by the &s;ame <HI>Bouteville,</HI> and others,
the 28th of <HI>January,</HI> 1625, that all who did har|bour,
receive or a&s;&s;i&s;t, them with Lodging, Victuals,
or any Thing el&s;e &s;hould be reckoned guilty of
High Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Duelling neverthele&s;s was &s;till &s;o Univer&s;al|ly
practi&s;ed, and &s;o many Per&s;ons of all Qualities
were thereby Obnoxious to the Laws, that upon
the Marriage of the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> Grand-Mother
to her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty of <HI>England,</HI> and Si&s;ter
to the &s;ame <HI>Louis</HI> XIII. of <HI>France,</HI> when that
<PB REF="12">
Prince was to grant his Subjects &s;ome Publick Act
of Grace, as a Te&s;timony of his own, and an En|couragement
to their Joy, upon &s;o Solemn an Oc|ca&s;ion,
nothing could be thought of, more accept|able
to the Publick, nor more conducive to the End
propo&s;ed, than a General Pardon for pa&s;t Duels,
which by his Edict at <HI>Paris</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> 1626,
he graciou&s;ly granted: But at the &s;ame Time, to
prevent that Scandalous Abu&s;e for the future, which
he had till then endeavoured by all Means, but Un|&s;ucce&s;sfully,
to Remedy, he adds to all former Edicts,
New Puni&s;hments, not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with at
the Sollicitation of any Per&s;on, nor upon any Ac|count
what&s;oever, as being le&s;s Rigorous than tho&s;e
formerly impo&s;ed: And the&s;e con&s;i&s;ted chiefly for
tho&s;e who &s;hould give or receive a Challenge,
without Slaughter committed (the Severity of all
former Edicts being reinforced again&s;t &s;uch as Kil|led)
in Bani&s;hment for a certain Term of Years,
Lo&s;s of all Places and Pen&s;ions that they held of his
Maje&s;ty, which were to be conferred upon others;
a Third Part of their E&s;tates, and Death, if they
offered to Challenge tho&s;e who &s;hould be pro|vided
to their Offices and Pen&s;ions: And that a
Pretext of Accidental Rencounters might not &s;erve
for an Excu&s;e to tho&s;e who premeditately Fought,
nor by withdrawing out of the Countrey, or to the
Frontiers, upon &s;uch De&s;igns, any might elude the
Force of the Law, it was Ordered by that Edict,
that in Rencounters the Aggre&s;&s;or &s;hould be Repu|ted
and Puni&s;hed as a Challenger, if he could be
known; and if it were doubtful who was the Ag|gre&s;&s;or,
both Parties &s;hould &s;uffer as &s;uch: That
tho&s;e who Fought out of the Countrey, or upon the
Borders, and made their E&s;cape thither, &s;hould be
Proceeded again&s;t as if the Fact were Committed
<PB REF="13">
in <HI>France;</HI> and that it &s;hould be Death and perpe|tual
Infamy to Employ Seconds, as being a Sign of
Cowardice, and Honourable to refu&s;e a Challenge,
or being a Second, as being a Mark of True Va|lour;
his Maje&s;ty promi&s;ing to Honour with his
E&s;teem, and Employ in his Service, both Civil and
Militrary, all who by &s;o doing pay'd Obedience to
his Edicts; and, Ordering, as in former Edicts,
the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> and other Judges of Ho|nour,
to Command &s;uch Reparations of Honour
to be made to the Obedient as might entirely &s;e|cure
their Reputation; for the more punctual Per|formance
whereof his Maje&s;ty interpo&s;es his Au|thority,
Swearing before God never to grant any
Remi&s;&s;ions for the afore-mentioned Crimes, and
enjoining his Judges to give no Re&s;pect to any &s;uch
Pardons, if pre&s;ented to them, as being &s;urrepti|tiou&s;ly
obtained from him. And his Maje&s;ty, to
&s;hew his firm Re&s;olution to &s;ee his Edict punctu|ally
put in Execution, &s;ometime after, upon a bare
Suppo&s;ition, that the Sieur of <HI>Liancourt</HI> had chal|lenged
the Sieur <HI>Cre&s;&s;ias,</HI> upon &s;ome Di&s;pute that

&s;till continued; in&s;omuch that the &s;ame King by
his Declaration of the 29th of <HI>May,</HI> 1634, com|manded
all the former Edicts again&s;t Duels to be
Publi&s;hed of new; &s;olemnly Swearing to grant
no Pardon for &s;uch Crimes, declaring tho&s;e who
&s;hould intercede for &s;uch Offenders, Enemies of his

all, of what Quality &s;oever, to Harbour or
A&s;&s;i&s;t &s;uch Delinquents, upon Pain of being Ba|ni&s;hed
the Court for a Year, and their Hou&s;es
razed, and cau&s;ing his Secretaries and Keeper of
the Great Seal to be Sworn not to Sign, or put the
the Seal to any Pardon for Duelling, though there|to
expre&s;ly required on his Part. And the Parlia|ment
of <HI>Paris</HI> in the Year 1635 declared the la&s;t
Will and Te&s;tament of a Per&s;on of Great Quality
who had fought a Duel, to be Null, as having For|feited
his Right of Te&s;tating by that Crime. The
&s;ame Parliament al&s;o in the Years 1638 and 1639,
upon Complaints made to that Court of the Con|tinued
Abu&s;e of Duelling, by the King's Attorney-General,
and in Obedience to a Letter from the
King, in the Year 1640, who in Con&s;ideration of
the Birth of the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> the pre&s;ent King of
<HI>France,</HI> had given a General Pardon for all prece|ding
Duels, made &s;everal Decrees for Publi&s;hing

Crime.</P>
<P>And in this State was the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> in
relation to Duelling, when the pre&s;ent King <HI>Louis</HI>
XIV, being but a Child, came to the Crown, and
a long Edict, with a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian and Elaborate
Preface to it, again&s;t that Crime in the Year 1643,

and the U&s;e of his Sovereign Authority, hath
taught his Subjects another Way of A&s;piring to Ho|nonour,
than by Killing one another for Punctilio's
and Trifles, having by the Methods mentioned in
the following Book reduced <HI>France</HI> to a Submi&s;&s;ive

<HEAD>AN
ACCOUNT
Of the Aboli&s;hing of
Duels in France.</HEAD>
<P>MANY Edicts, Declarations, and Decrees,
were &s;et forth by the Kings and Parlia|ments
in <HI>France,</HI> during the Reigns of
<HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, and <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thir|teenth,
the pre&s;ent King's Father and Grandfather,
for Suppre&s;&s;ing <HI>Duels</HI> and <HI>Rencounters,</HI> and other
Means were us'd by them for the &s;ame Effect, but
without Succe&s;s. <HI>Lewis</HI> the Fourteenth, the pre&s;ent
King, at the Entrance of his Reign, made a long E|dict
again&s;t tho&s;e Crimes in the Year 1643, and on
the Eleventh of <HI>May,</HI> 1644, &s;et forth a Declaration,
which was confirm'd in Parliament the Ninth of
<HI>June</HI> following, whereby reiterated Prohibitions were
made to all Per&s;ons again&s;t Challenging each other,
Fighting Duels, Rencounters, or otherwi&s;e; and a|gain&s;t
Contravening to the Edicts and Declarations
of his Maje&s;ty, under the Pains provided by the Or|dinances.</P>
<P>On
the Thirteenth of <HI>March,</HI> 1646, he &s;et forth
another Declaration, Prohibiting <HI>Quarrels, Duels,
Challenges,</HI> and <HI>Rencounters;</HI> this being a Confirmati|on
and Augmentation of the Penalties contain'd in
the Edicts, Declarations and Decrees, formerly made
<PB N="2" REF="17">
on the &s;aid Subject, which Declaration was al&s;o Pub|li&s;hed
in Parliament the Twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> in the
&s;ame Year.</P>
<P>In the Year 1651, in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> upon
the King's being Declar'd Major, and he being well
po&s;&s;e&s;t of what Importance it was to the State to
have the&s;e <HI>Duels</HI> and <HI>Rencounters</HI> Aboli&s;ht, he &s;et
forth a more Ample and Peremptory Edict again&s;t
them, than any had been in the Reigus of his Father
or Grandfather, it con&s;i&s;ting of Twenty-four Articles;
which Edict was al&s;o confirmed in Parliament, the
King being pre&s;ent, in the &s;ame Month and Year;
and he took a firm Re&s;olution to have the Penalties
therein contain'd effectually put in Execution again&s;t
all &s;uch as &s;hould Contravene. <HI>I &s;hall not give it you
here, by Rea&s;on of a more Comprehen&s;ive Edict which you
will find in the Sequel.</HI></P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>May,</HI> 1653, the King &s;et forth
another Declaration again&s;t <HI>Duels,</HI> it being an En|largement
and Explanation of &s;ome Points in the
foregoing Edict; in the latter Part of which it is &s;aid
thus: And for a&s;much as the Fifth Article concern|ing
the Satisfactions which ought to be appointed by
Our Co&s;ins the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> for Per&s;ons offend|ed
in Honour &s;eems to be coucht in Two General
Terms, and that the expre&s;s Prote&s;tation made a long
Time before Our la&s;t Edict, and the Engagement in
Writing of many Gentlemen of Quality of our King|dom,
of not receiving for the Time to come any Chal|lenge,
requires that there be a full and advantageous
Provi&s;ion for the Reparation of Offences, which may
be made to their Reputation, and to the Reputation
of tho&s;e who &s;hall ab&s;tain for the future from taking
Satisfaction of them&s;elves, and who &s;hall have Re|cour&s;e
to &s;uch as we have E&s;tabli&s;h'd for rendring
them Ju&s;tice, it is our Will and Plea&s;ure, That our
Co&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> &s;hall meet forthwith,
to prepare a Rule as exact and clear as may be con|cerning
the divers Satisfactions and Reparations of
Honour, that they &s;hall judge ought to be ordain'd
according to the divers Degrees of Offences; which
Rule &s;hall be inviolably &s;tood to for the future by
<PB N="3" REF="18">
all tho&s;e who &s;hall be employ'd in the Accommoda|tions
of Differences, which &s;hall concern Point of Ho|nour,

was confirm'd in Parliament the Twenty|ninth
of <HI>July,</HI> in the &s;ame Year.</P>
<P>On the Thirtieth of <HI>July,</HI> 1657, there was a De|cree
of the Court of Parliament, importing a Reitera|tion
of Prohibitions of Duels, and enjoining Officers
to be very attentive in di&s;covering Crimes of Duels
wherein they had been found Negligent.</P>
<P>Now many Gentlemen of Quality in <HI>France,</HI> before
the Year 1651, (as it is before intimated,) had made
a Publick Declaration and Solemn Prote&s;tation un|der
their Hands to refu&s;e all kinds of Challenges,
and never to Fight a Duel on any Account what&s;oe|ver.
It was Worded in the&s;e Terms:</P>
<P>The Sub&s;ign'd, by the Pre&s;ent Writing, make a
Publick Declaration and Solemn Prote&s;tation of refu|&s;ing
all kinds of Challenges, and of not Fighting a

all kind of Te&s;timony of the Dete&s;tation they have of
Duels, as a Thing wholly contrary to Rea&s;on, to the
Welfare and the Laws of the State, and incon&s;i&s;tent

renouncing the Right of repelling by all Lawful
Ways any Injuries that &s;hall be offered them, accord|ing

&s;hall conceive them&s;elves to have &s;ome Cau&s;e of a

Occa&s;ion to any Man.</P>
<P>The Mar&s;hals of <HI>France</HI> being made acquainted and
pre&s;ented with this Declaration by the Gentlemen
who Sub&s;ign'd it, and being de&s;ired their Sen&s;e of it,

<P>Fora&s;much as many Gentlemen, very well known
as well by the Illu&s;trious Marks of their Hou&s;es, as

Execution of the King's Edicts again&s;t the pernicious
<PB N="4" REF="19">
U&s;e of Duels, introduc'd, and grown inveterate in
<HI>France,</HI> to the great Prejudice of Chri&s;tian Religion,

renouncing the Right of Repelling by all Lawful
Ways Injuries that &s;hall be offered them, as much as
their Profe&s;&s;ion and Birth obliges them to it: Being
al&s;o alway ready on their Parts to give with Sincerity

the Holy Gho&s;t has laid on us of governing
the Church of God, to provide Charitably for the
Nece&s;&s;ities of our Neighbour, and to procure the Sal|vation

after having &s;een the Declaration made by many Gen|tlemen

the Judgment given by the <HI>Mar&s;hals</HI> of <HI>France</HI>
on the &s;aid Declaration, have judg'd it proper to ap|prove
the Generous and Chri&s;tian Conduct of both
concerning the &s;aid Declaration and Judgment, and to
fulminate withal new Anathema's again&s;t the In&s;olence
and Barbarou&s;ne&s;s of Duels; Nature has them in
Horrour, Rea&s;on condemns them, and the Civil and

is arm'd with its mo&s;t rigorous Vengeance to Puni&s;h
&s;uch Mon&s;trous Crimes.</P>
<P>They are the&s;e cruel Exce&s;&s;es which bring at the &s;ame

Nature, an Injury on Religion, a Shame on Chri|&s;tianity,
and cau&s;e a Weakening in the State, the
Scandal of the People, the Anger of Heaven, and the
Lo&s;s of Souls.</P>
<P>Is is not to extingui&s;h the Sentiments of Huma|nity,
and to dive&s;t us of the Light of Rea&s;on, for a
Man to go about to de&s;troy his Like, and to expo&s;e
him&s;elf to the Danger of being lo&s;t, by giving way to
a bruti&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;eems to imitate the fury of
Tygers; or to e&s;tabli&s;h a Point of Imaginary Honour,
which promotes a bloody and cruel Doctrine of Man|&s;laughter;
which gives Rules for Murther, and which
di&s;gui&s;es A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in a Method and Mea&s;ure, to &s;e|duce
very often the mo&s;t da&s;tardly Spirits, and the

<P><PB N="6" REF="21">
The Decree of Pope <HI>Steven</HI> prohibits the ill Cu&s;tom

by a burning hot Iron; and St. <HI>Thomas</HI> judges very per|tinently,
that at the &s;ame time he condemns <HI>Duels.</HI> In
reality, what colour is there for committing to the
Chance of Arms a Man's Reputation, his Life, his E|ternity,
&s;ince it happens even very often by a ju&s;t Judg|ment

<P>Let Princes therefore and Magi&s;trates arm their Au|thority
with a new Vigour to mark with Infamy the&s;e
Gladiators, who &s;eem in contempt of Chri&s;tianity to
go about to revive Pagani&s;m and Idolatry. It may be
&s;aid that we breathe yet the Contagious Breath of tho&s;e
Unfortunate Ages, in which Men &s;acrificed to Idols the
Blood and Life of Mankind. O Princes! O Judges!
O Grandees of the Earth! who are the Umpires of
the Fortune of Men, if by the Civil Laws you ought
to &s;ee that the Poor be relieved with Food, which is
nece&s;&s;ary for them, what account will you have to
give before God, if you do not labour, as you may,
to dry up the Sources of Blood, which in the Lan|guage
of the Scripture are tho&s;e of all Crimes?</P>
<P>The u&s;e of Blood was expre&s;ly forbidden among
the <HI>Hebrews</HI> for Two chief Rea&s;ons; Fir&s;t, to aboli&s;h
Idolatry; And Secondly, to condemn Cruelty. God
alone ought to be the Ma&s;ter of the Life of Men, and
the Blood $f Animals was retain'd in the Sacrifices for
an Acknowledgment of the Sovereign Dominion of
God, and to red$$m the Life of &s;inful Men by the effu|&s;ion
of the Blood of the Offerings: But in the Law of
the Go&s;pel the Prophet <HI>I&s;arab</HI> foretold us, That
Fights, Wars, and Slaughter, &s;hould cea&s;e, in the Peace
of the Church, and under the Empire of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias.</HI>
who is the true pacifick <HI>Solomon;</HI> this Blood ought not
to be &s;pilt but for the Glory of God, and the Support
of the Throne, for increa&s;ing the Crowns of Religion,
and that of the State, for the Promotion of Faith, and
for the Intere&s;ts of our lawful Monarch; this Blood,
which the In&s;olence of the Dueli&s;ts, and the Silence of
the Judges, unworthily &s;heds, requires another Ven|geance,
which mu&s;t give a Terror to tho&s;e who have
<PB N="7" REF="22">
any Sen&s;e of the Fear of God. The Voice of the Blood
which is &s;pilt on the Earth carries its Cry even to
Heaven, and more yet the Voice of the Blood of the
Son of God, which cries far beyond that of <HI>Abel;</HI> as
St. <HI>Gregory</HI> explains it.</P>
<P>If then the Spectacle of a dying God makes an Im|pre&s;&s;ion
on our Hearts, and if the Image of his cruel
Martyrdom is not blotted out of our Memories; let
us for ever condemn Duels, having in horror the&s;e de|te&s;table
Practices, which cau&s;e a Precious Blood to be
&s;acrificed to Devils, that ought to be manag'd for the
Service of a God, who through an Exce&s;s of Love not
to be equall'd, was Prodigal of his own to extingui&s;h
our Crimes and Ingratitudes: And at the &s;ame time
let us rai&s;e our Hands to Heaven, to draw down the
Ble&s;&s;ings of God on this Illu&s;tirous Nobility, which
has &s;o Chri&s;tianly renounced tho&s;e fal&s;e Maxims, to
imbrace with a perfect Religion tho&s;e of the Go&s;pel.

Greatne&s;s of your Courages, &s;hall lo&s;e nothing of its

in Writing, and Sign'd by their Hands, have after a
mature Deliberation concluded and re&s;olv'd of the
following Articles.</P>
<P>I. That in all the Occa&s;ions and Subjects which may
cau&s;e Quarrels and Re&s;entments, no Gentleman ought
to e&s;teem contrary to Honour what&s;oever may give a
full and &s;incere Explanation of the Truth.</P>
<P>II. That among Gentlemen many having already
prote&s;ted Solemnly, and in Writing, to refu&s;e all Sorts
of Challenges, and not to Fight a Duel on any Cau&s;e
what&s;oever: The&s;e are by &s;o much the more oblig'd
to give tho&s;e clear Explanations, that without it they
will formally act contrary to what they have written,
and &s;hall con&s;equently be more worthy Reprehen&s;ion
and Cha&s;ti&s;ement in the Accommodations of the Quar|rels
which &s;hall happen for want of a clear Under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="25">
III. That if a Per&s;on pretending to be offended has
&s;o little Rea&s;on, as not to re&s;t &s;atisfy'd with a clear Un|der&s;tanding,
which has been &s;incerely given him, and
that he will oblige the Per&s;on by whom he conceives
him&s;elf to have been offended, to Fight him; he that
has renounc'd Duels may an&s;wer him after this or the
lik$ manner: <HI>That he much wonders, that knowing the
la&s;t Edicts of the King, and particularly the Declaration
of many Gentlemen, in which he has publickly ingag'd
him&s;elf not to Fight, he will not content him&s;elf with the
clear under&s;tanding that he gives him; and that he does
not con&s;ider that he neither can, nor ought, to appoint or re|ceive
any Place for Fighting, nor even to &s;ignifie to him the
Places where he might have a Rencounter, but that he &s;hall
change nothing in his u&s;ual way of Living.</HI> And general|ly
all other Gentlemen may an&s;wer, <HI>That if they are
&s;et upon they &s;hall defend them&s;elves, but that they do not
think their Honour obliges them to go and Fight in cold
Blood, and &s;o formally contravene to the Edicts of his Ma|je&s;ty,
to the Laws of Religion, and to their Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>IV. When there has been &s;ome Difference betwixt
Gentlemen, whereof the one Party has Promis'd and
Sign'd not to Fight, and the others not, the&s;e la&s;t
&s;hall be alway reputed Aggre&s;&s;ors, unle&s;s the contrary
appears by very plain Proofs.</P>
<P>V. And becau&s;e the Ways of Fact might ea&s;ily be
prevented, if we, the Governours or the Lieutenants-General
of the Provinces were not carefully advertiz'd
of all the Cau&s;es and Beginnings of Quarrels, we have
con&s;ulted and re&s;olv'd, conformably to the Power
given us by the la&s;t Edict of his Maje&s;ty, Regi&s;tred in
the Parliament, the King there pre&s;ent, the 7th of
<HI>September,</HI> 1651, to nominate and appoint alway in each
Bailywick and Sene&s;chalty of this Kingdom, one or
more Gentlemen of Quality, Age and Ability, requi&s;ite
for taking Informations of the Differences of Gentle|men,
and to &s;end them to us, or to the Governours
and Lieutenants-General of the Provinces, when they
&s;hall be there Re&s;ident; and to be generally done by
the &s;aid Gentlemen deputed, what is pre&s;cribed by the
&s;econd Article of the &s;aid Edict.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="26">
And we order, conformably to the &s;ame Edict,
all our Provo&s;ts, Vice-Bailiffs, Vice-Sene&s;chals, Lieu|tenants-Criminal
of the Short Robe, and other Offi|cers
of the Mar&s;hal&s;eas, to obey readily and faith|fully
the &s;aid Gentlemen deputed, for the Execution
of their Orders.</P>
<P>VI. And to the End we may yet more carefully
be Advertiz'd of the Differences of Gentlemen, we
declare according to the Third Article of the &s;ame E|dict,
That all Per&s;ons who &s;hall happen to be, tho'
by Chance, at the Places where Offences &s;hall be
given, be it by an Injurious Report, Di&s;cour&s;es, or
Words; be it by a failure of Promi&s;e; be it by giving
the Lie; by offering Threats; a Box on the Ear; a
Stroke with a Cudgel; or other Violations of Honour;
of what Nature &s;oever they are; &s;hall for the future
be oblig'd to give us Notice of them, or to the Go|vernours
or Lieutenants-General of the Provinces, or
to the Gentlemen deputed, under Pain of being re|puted
Complices in the &s;aid Offences, and to be Pro|&s;ecuted
as having tacitly contributed to them; and
that tho&s;e who &s;hall have Knowledge of Suits in Law,
which &s;hall be upon the Point of being begun betwixt
Gentlemen for any Important Concern, &s;hall al&s;o be
oblig'd, according to the &s;ame Third Article of the
&s;aid Edict, to give us Notice of it, or to the Governors,
or Lieutenants-General of the Provinces, or to the
Gentlemen deputed in the Bailywicks, to the End
that a Means may be us'd to hinder the Parties from
pa&s;&s;ing the Ways of ordinary Ju&s;tice, to come to
tho&s;e of Fact, and to do them&s;elves Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>VII. And becau&s;e in all Offences that may be re|ceiv'd
it is Nece&s;&s;ary to E&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome General Rules
for Satisfactions, which will &s;ufficiently repair Ho|nour
as &s;oon as they &s;hall be receiv'd and practis'd,
&s;ince it is but too manife&s;t, that its Opinion which
has E&s;tabli&s;ht for the greate&s;t Part the Maxims of
Point of Honour; and con&s;idering that in Offences
we mu&s;t mind in the fir&s;t Place, whether they have
been given without Cau&s;e, and if they have not been
repell'd by &s;ome Repartees or Revenges of a more
Outrageous Nature: We declare, that in tho&s;e which
<PB N="12" REF="27">
have been &s;o offer'd, without Cau&s;e, and which have
not been return'd, if they con&s;i&s;t in injurious Words,
as of <HI>Sot, Coward, Traitor,</HI> and the like, it may be or|dain'd
for Puni&s;hment, that the Offender &s;hall be Im|pri&s;oned
for a Month, the Time being not to be di|mini&s;h'd,
through the Intere&s;t or Reque&s;t of any one
what&s;oever, nor even through the Indulgence of the
Per&s;on offended: And that after he &s;hall come forth of
Pri&s;on he &s;hall declare to the Per&s;on offended, <HI>That
unmeetly and impertinently he has Offended him by Abu&s;ive
Words, which he owns to be fal&s;e, and begs his Pardon
for it.</HI></P>
<P>VIII. For giving the Lie, or u&s;ing Threats of a Box
on the Ear, or of a Stroke with a Stick, there may be
ordain'd Two Months Impri&s;onment, the Time not
to be dimini&s;hed, as before; and after the Offender is
come forth of Pri&s;on, he &s;hall ask Pardon of the Offen|ded,
with Words more yet &s;atisfactory than the fore|mention'd,
and which &s;hall be particularly &s;pecified by
the Judges of Point of Honour.</P>
<P>IX. For actual Offences of a Box on the Ear, and
the like, it &s;hall be ordain'd for Puni&s;hment, that the
Offender &s;hall be Impri&s;on'd for Six Months, the Time
not to be dimini&s;h'd as before; unle&s;s the Offender &s;hall
de&s;ire that half the Time for his Impri&s;onment be ex|chang'd
into a Fine, which &s;hall not be le&s;s than 1500
Livres, to be given to the neare&s;t Ho&s;pital to the Place
of Abode of the Offended, and which &s;hall be paid
before the &s;aid Offender comes forth of Pri&s;on. And
even after he &s;hall be come forth he &s;hall &s;ubmit him|&s;elf
al&s;o to receive from the Hand of the Offended the
like Strokes to tho&s;e which he gave, and &s;hall declare
in Words and Writing, That he has bruti&s;hly &s;truck
him, and begs him to Pardon and Forgive this Of|fence.</P>
<P>X.
For Strokes with a Cudgel, or the like Abu&s;es,
the Offender &s;hall be Impri&s;on'd a whole Year; and
the Time not to be moderated, unle&s;s it be for Six
Months, by paying 3000 Livres Fine, payable and to
be applied as above. And after he is come forth of
Pri&s;on he &s;hall ask Pardon of the Offended kneeling
on the Ground; &s;hall &s;ubmit him&s;elf in this State to
<PB N="13" REF="28">
receive the like Strokes; &s;hall mo&s;t humbly thank him
if he does not give him them, as he might do. And
&s;hall farther declare by Word and Writing, That he
has bruti&s;hly offended him; that he begs of him to
forget it; and that if he were in his Place he would
be content with the &s;ame Satisfactions. And in all
the Offences of Strokes with the Hand, or a Stick, or
the like, be&s;ide the fore&s;aid Puni&s;hments and Satisfa|ctions,
the Offended may be oblig'd to cha&s;ti&s;e the
Offender with the like Strokes he has received, even
tho' he &s;hould have the Genero&s;ity of not being inclin'd
to do it; and this only in ca&s;e the Offence be judg'd
&s;o Barbarous by the Circum&s;tances, that it de&s;erves that
the Offended be reduc'd to this Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>XI. And at the time the Reconciliations are made
in all the fore&s;aid Ca&s;es, the Judges of Point of Ho|nour
may order what number they plea&s;e of the
Friends of the Offended, to &s;ee the Satisfactions which
&s;hall be ordain'd, and render them more Notorious.</P>
<P>XII. For any Offences or Violations of Honour
which &s;hall be offer'd a Gentleman on the account of
&s;ome Civil Intere&s;t, or of &s;ome Action which &s;hall al|ready
be begun before the ordinary Judges, we cannot
in Offences &s;o hapning be too &s;evere in the Satisfacti|ons.
And tho&s;e who &s;hall regulate the like Differences,
be&s;ides the Puni&s;hments &s;pecified above in each kind
of Offence, may farther order Bani&s;hment for what
time they think fit from the Places where the Offen|der
makes his ordinary Re&s;idence. And when it &s;hall
be manife&s;t by notoriou&s;ne&s;s of the Fact, or other
Proofs, that a Gentleman has po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of any
Thing by the Ways of Fact or by Surprize, no Agree|ment
can be made, even concerning Point of Honour,
till the Thing in Conte&s;t has been fir&s;t put in the State
it was before the Violence, or the Surprize.</P>
<P>XIII. And becau&s;e be&s;ide the abovemention'd Cau&s;es
of Differences, Promi&s;es that are pretended to have
been made and violated, produce infinite others: We
declare, That a Gentleman who has gotten a Promi&s;e
from another, concerning any Thing what&s;oever, can|not
build thereon any Thing for the future, nor com|plain
that it has been violated, unle&s;s it has been gi|ven
<PB N="14" REF="29">
him in Writing, or in the Pre&s;ence of one or more
Gentlemen. And thus all Gentlemen &s;hall be oblig'd
for the future to take this Precaution, not only for
obeying our Orders, but likewi&s;e for the Intere&s;t each
Man has to con&s;erve the Friend&s;hip of him who has
given him his Word, and of not being declar'd Ag|gre&s;&s;or,
as he &s;hall be henceforward in all the Quar|rels
which &s;hall happen after a Promi&s;e without Wri|ting
o$ Witne&s;&s;es, and which he &s;hall pretend has not
been kept.</P>
<P>XIV If a Promi&s;e given in Writing, or before o|ther
Gentlemen, be found violated, the Per&s;on inte|re&s;ted
&s;hall be obliged to ask Ju&s;tice of us, of the Go|vernours
or Lieutenants-General of the Provinces, or of
the Gentlemen deputed; in default of which he &s;hall
be reputed Aggre&s;&s;or in all the Quarrels which may
happen con&s;equentially to the &s;aid Promi&s;e violated;
as al&s;o all the Witne&s;&s;es of the &s;aid Promi&s;e violated,
who have not given notice of it, &s;hall be re&s;pon&s;ible
for all the Di&s;orders which may thence happen. And
as to what regards the &s;aid Failings of a Man's Word,
the Reparations and Satisfactions &s;hall be ordered ac|cording
to the Importance of the Matter.</P>
<P>XV. If by the relation of Per&s;ons pre&s;ent, or by o|ther
Proofs, it appears that an Injury has been done
with a premeditated De&s;ign, in a frolick Humour, and
with an Advantage, we declare, That according to
the Laws of Honour the Offended may pro&s;ecute the
Aggre&s;&s;or and his Complices before the ordinary Judges,
as if he had been A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; and this Proceeding
ought not to &s;eem &s;trange, becau&s;e he that offends a|nother
on an Advantage, renders him&s;elf by this Action
unworthy to be treated as a Gentleman: Provided
neverthele&s;s that the Per&s;on offended had not rather refer
him&s;elf to our Judgement, or to that of other Judges of
Point of Honour for his Satisfaction, and for the Cha|&s;ti&s;ement
of the Aggre&s;&s;or; which ought to be much
greater than all the preceding, that regard only tho&s;e
Offences which are offered in Quarrels that happen by
Chance.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="30">
XVI. In ca&s;e a Gentleman refu&s;es, or deferrs with|out
any lawful Cau&s;e, to obey our Orders, or tho&s;e of
the other Judges of Point of Honour, as to render him|&s;elf
before us or them, when he has been &s;ummon'd
by an Act &s;ignified to him, or at his Hou&s;e, and al&s;o
when he has not undergone the Pains ordain'd again&s;t
him, he &s;hall alway be con&s;train'd to it, after a certain
Time pre&s;crib'd him, by being kept under Guard in
his Hou&s;e or Impri&s;on'd, conformably to the Eighth
Article of the &s;aid Edict, which &s;hall be carefully exe|cuted
by our Provo&s;ts, Vice-Bailiffs, Vice-Sene&s;chals,
Lieutenants-Criminal of the Short Robe, and other
Lieutenants and Sergeants of the Mar&s;hai&s;eas, under
Pain of Su&s;pen&s;ion of their Places, and Privation of
their Salary; and the &s;aid Execution &s;hall be perform'd
at the Co&s;t and Charges of the Party di&s;obedient and
refractory.</P>
<P>XVII. And according to the &s;ame Eighth Article of
the &s;aid Edict, if our Provo&s;ts, Vice-Bailiffs, Vice-Se|ne&s;chals,
Lieutenants-Criminal of the Short Robe, and
other Officers of the Mar&s;hal&s;eas, cannot execute the
&s;aid Impri&s;onments, they &s;hall &s;eize all the Revenues
of the &s;aid di&s;obedient Per&s;ons, &s;hall give Notice of
the &s;aid Seizures to the Solicitors-General, or to their
Sub&s;titutes, according to the la&s;t Declaration again&s;t
Duels, Regi&s;tred in the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> the 29th of
<HI>July</HI> la&s;t; the &s;aid Revenues to be apply'd, and to
continue all the time of the Di&s;obedience acquir'd, to
the Ho&s;pital of the Town where the Parliament &s;hall
be, under the Juri&s;diction of which the E&s;tates of the
di&s;obedient Per&s;ons are, conjointly with the Ho&s;pital
of the Royal Seat of Juri&s;diction whence they al&s;o de|pend;
to the End that interaiding each other in the
Pro&s;ecution, the one may furni&s;h the Information and
Proof, and the other the Ju&s;tice and Authority. And
in ca&s;e there are precedent Debts, which hinder the
receipt of the Revenue confi&s;cated to the Profit of the
&s;aid Ho&s;pitals, the Sum to which the &s;aid Revenue
might amount, &s;hall become a Mortgag'd Debt on all
the E&s;tate moveable and immoveable of the Di&s;obedi|ent,
to be paid and di&s;charg'd in its Order, according
to the &s;ame Eighth Article of the &s;aid Edict.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="31">
XVIII. If tho&s;e to whom we and the other Judges
of Point of Honour have given Guards, &s;hall make
their E&s;cape, the Reconciliation &s;hall not be made till
they have kept Pri&s;on during the Time ordain'd.</P>
<P>XIX. And generally in all the other Differences of
Offences, which have not been &s;pecified here above,
and whereof the variety is infinite; as if they have
been made with Cau&s;e, and if they have been
repell'd with more heinous Repartees: Or if by
outrageous Words the Per&s;on offending has drawn on
him&s;elf the Lie, or &s;ome &s;troke with the Hand; and
in a word, in all other Occa&s;ions of Injuries in&s;en&s;ibly
aggravated; we remit it to the Judges of Point of Ho|nour
to ordain &s;uch Puni&s;hments and Satisfactions as
the Ca&s;e and Circum&s;tances &s;hall require; exhorting
them to have alway a particular Con&s;ideration to him
who has been the Aggre&s;&s;or and the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of the
Offence; and to &s;end before us all tho&s;e who are de&s;i|rous
to repre&s;ent to us their Rea&s;ons conformably to
the &s;econd Article of the fir&s;t Edict of his Maje&s;ty, Re|gi&s;tred,

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF all the Titles which belong to your Maje&s;ty
through the Right of your Ance&s;tors, and the
Splendor of your Vertues, I find none more Il|lu&s;trious
nor more Glorious than that of the Sword of
the Chri&s;tian World, which was given St. <HI>Louis</HI> by an
Emperor of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> becau&s;e this Elogy, by &s;ome
relation to the Quality of <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts</HI> which the Ho|ly
Scripture has given to God, declares your Maje&s;ty
not only the Protector of the Church, but likewi&s;e
Sovereign Umpire of Combats. <HI>Marcellus</HI> was the
fir&s;t to whom was given the formidable Name of the
Sword of the World, becau&s;e he was an invincible De|fender
of the Liberty of the <HI>Romans;</HI> but with whom
may it more ju&s;tly agree than with a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
King, who from his mo&s;t tender Infancy has quencht
the Fire of Civil Wars, and who $word$ his Majority
counts fewer Years than Victories again&s;t the Ancient
Enemies of this Crown? So the Zeal to Religion, and
the In&s;tinct of a natural Valour, have $word$ your Ma|je&s;ty
with the Chri&s;tian and Generous Re&s;olution of
renewing your Solemn Edicts again&s;t Fatal Combats,
where the noble&s;t Portion of your Subjects, abandon|ing,
through a Fatal Blindne&s;s, the Salvation of their
<PB N="18" REF="33">
Souls, &s;hew the Marks of their Weakne&s;s, when they
think to &s;ignalize the Grandure of their Courage.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> We thought that the Care of the Salvation of
Souls, wherein our Duty engages us, oblig'd our Or|der
to give mo&s;t humble Thanks to your Maje&s;ty for a
Law &s;o Holy, tho' indeed we could have wi&s;ht that the
Articles of the Edict, which concern Burials and Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
Cen&s;ures, had been coucht in Terms which
had not offended the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority: And as
we carry the Word of the Church, which declares al|way
the Word of God, we have thought it at the
&s;ame time our indi&s;pen&s;able Duty to join to our
Thank&s;givings &s;ome Important In&s;tructions for the
Succe&s;s of the Religious Intentions of your Maje|&s;ty.</P>
<P>The
<HI>Romans</HI> who e&s;tabli&s;ht their Empire by the
violence of Arms, on the Ruins of the mo&s;t Power|ful
Monarchies, were &s;o &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;t with the bru|tal
Fury of Duels, that according to the relation of one
of their mo&s;t Famous Hi&s;torians, in the beginning of
their State they own'd no other Judge, even for &s;ha|ring
their E&s;tates, than the Chance of Combats: So
that the wi&s;e&s;t among them propos'd in&s;en&s;ibly Laws
to the People, to the end, that without &s;pilling
Blood Actions might be determin'd by the &s;ole Ways
of Ju&s;tice; we may &s;ay, that this furious Spirit had
pa&s;t to the <HI>French</HI> till the Age of St. <HI>Louis,</HI> who con|demn'd
the dete&s;table Abu&s;e which was introduc'd, of
permitting, on certain Occa&s;ions, &s;et Combats. And
our Kings, animated by &s;o powerful an Example, have
taken Care from time to time to cau&s;e new Edicts to
be Publi&s;ht again&s;t this wicked Attempt: But, alas!
the multitude of Remedies have exa&s;perated the Di|&s;temper
in&s;tead of appea&s;ing it; the Laws have been
violated with Iniquity, and the Prohibitions have
&s;erv'd but to add In&s;olence to the Crime.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> Certainly there was never &s;o dangerous an In|ju&s;tice,
nor &s;o &s;trange an Overthrow of good Maxims,
as when the <HI>French,</HI> through a phanta&s;tical Conceit,
and a fal&s;e Idea they conceiv'd of Vertue, join'd Glory
to the Fury of <HI>Duels:</HI> This Barbarous Action has been
<PB N="19" REF="34">
Condemn'd by the whole Church: The Council of
<HI>Trent</HI> &s;trikes with <HI>Anathema</HI> tho&s;e that are guilty of
them; it &s;eparates them from the Society of the Faith|ful,
to &s;hew us that God has already cut them off in
Heaven from the Company of the Ble&s;&s;ed; and to extend
their Penalty after Death, it deprives them of Church
Burial. Your Maje&s;ty in your Throne of Ju&s;tice, where
you Soveraignly decide the true Point of Honour, pu|ni&s;hes
with the la&s;t Puni&s;hment the&s;e infamous Gladia|tors;
true Rea&s;on condemns them al&s;o of Weakne&s;s.
In reality, whoever is not able to wait the Reparation
of an Injury by Publick Authority, &s;hews his Impo|tency
in re&s;i&s;ting the more &s;evere A&s;&s;aults of Fortune;
for being reduc'd to the Extremity either of Support|ing
con&s;tantly an Offence, or to hazard his Life to Re|venge
it, he Cowardly chu&s;es a le&s;s Ill to avoid a
greater, that is to &s;ay, the Danger of Death, to free him|&s;elf
from an imaginary Infamy which appears to him
In&s;upportable.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s I am forc'd to &s;ay with an extream
Grief, that all Rea&s;onings make no Impre&s;&s;ion on the
Mind in this Occa&s;ion; that the Rigour of the Edicts
is contemptible; and that even the Fulminations of the
Church become of no Force for breaking the hardne&s;s
of Mens Hearts, while there is room for imagining
that your Maje&s;ty gives &s;ome part of your E&s;teem to
the&s;e Sanguinary Men: So true it is that the <HI>French</HI>
Nobility, who are jealous of their Reputation above
all the Nations of the Earth, look on your Maje&s;ty
as the only Umpire, and the Sole Di&s;po&s;er of Glory.
And therefore, <HI>Sir,</HI> if your Maje&s;ty will reform a
Di&s;order which weakens your State, if you will ma|nage
the Blood of the Noble&s;t of your Subjects for
your Service in your Armies, if you will divert the
Anger of God, from whom the Voice of Blood &s;pilt
by Murther continually calls for Vengeance, you mu&s;t
declare your Sentiments by Marks of Infamy on the
Guilty; your private Di&s;cour&s;es mu&s;t accord with your
Edicts; you mu&s;t &s;peak in your Privy Clo&s;et as on
the Tribunals of Ju&s;tice; and that being per&s;uaded
there is Cowardice in Duels, it may imprint &s;o ju&s;t
an Opinion in the Spirits of your Nobility.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="35">
Solid Honour is in&s;eparably join'd to Duty; it's as
a Ray which nece&s;&s;arily derives it&s;elf from the Light;
it's a Flower which cannot be gathered but from the
Stalk of Vertue: And as Kings give Proofs of their
Courage, when according to your Maje&s;ties Example
they expo&s;e their Lives in the Head of their Armies for
the Good of their State; &s;o Subjects give a Te&s;timo|ny
of their Valour when they expo&s;e their Lives for
the Service of their Kings. The mo&s;t Famous Dueli&s;ts
have never been our mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Captains; and
tho&s;e who have be&s;t &s;ucceeded in the&s;e unju&s;t Com|bats,
are not the Men who have defeated our Enemies
in Battles; Ang$$ or Fury have much a greater Part in
tho&s;e brutal Actions than $word$ Valour. It is Pa&s;&s;ion
which coun&s;els them, it's Chance or Skill which brings
them off, it's Cu$$om which approves them, and final|ly,
it's the Demon of the Age which crowns them. I
add, That your Maje&s;ty is very greatly intere&s;ted in
&s;o Noble a Sentiment; for if Honour were included
in Duel$, it would follow that your Maje&s;ty, who
di&s;putes already in your fir&s;t Exploits the Prize of Mi|litary
Vertue with the greate&s;t Captains, would find
your&s;elf depriv'd of an Occa&s;ion of Glory, as not b$|ing
to enter this Li&s;t of &s;ingle Combats; much more
through the Default of an Adver&s;ary of your Strength&punc;
than by the Rank of your Birth, &s;ince our Age pro|duces
not <HI>Alexanders</HI> nor <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> to enter the Field
with you.</P>
<P>I call here before the Th$one of your Maje&s;ty that
Illu&s;trious Body of Gentlemen, of the greate&s;t Hou&s;es
of the Kingdom, who after having given &s;ignal Proof,
of their Courage on divers Occa&s;ions for your Service,
have generou&s;ly r$nounc'd by a Solemn Writing the $$|lu&s;ion
of the Evil Spirit, to keep the Obligations $word$
their Bapti&s;m: Shall it be &s;aid that they wax Pale at
the fir&s;t A&s;pect of Death? They look it in the Face dai|ly
very near, under a more horrible A&s;pect, in the
mid&s;t of Armies. Shall it be &s;aid that they dread the
Efforts of their Enemies? They are not capable of
Fear, according to the Maxims of the Go&s;pel, but
for your Anger, and that of God, who can deliver
<PB N="21" REF="36">
Body and Soul to eternal Puni&s;hments. Shall it be
&s;aid that they are touch'd with a Pa&s;&s;ion of le&s;s Zeal
for your Service? On the contrary, their Fidelity is
&s;upported on a Foundation not to be &s;haken, &s;ince they
are tied to their Duty toward your Maje&s;ty by the
&s;ame Principle which unites them with God.</P>
<P>I &s;hould prevaricate in this Cau&s;e if I did not mo&s;t
humbly &s;upply your Maje&s;ty to make a &s;erious Re|flection
on the Miracle which God began to operate in
your Reign by the holy Con&s;piracy of the&s;e Chri&s;tian
Heroes; but I &s;hould be much more guilty to retain
Truth a Captive in Inju&s;tice, if I &s;hould di&s;&s;emble to
you that all the Gifts of God turn alway to our Salva|tion,
or to our Ruin. <HI>Sir,</HI> Permit me to &s;ay, with the
Liberty which my Function gives me, that your Ma|je&s;ty
cannot receive with Indifference the Means which
God pre&s;ents you for &s;topping the Rage of Duels; for
as the Chief Cau&s;e of this Blindne&s;s depends on the
E&s;teem of the Nobility, who have no more certain
Rule in their Actions, than the Precious Judgment of
your Maje&s;ty; it follows, that as you may quell this
cruel Di&s;order by the Marks of your Contempt and
Aver&s;ion, you may al&s;o foment it by the contrary Sen|timents;
and thus by a Misfortune which we will be|lieve
impo&s;&s;ible, you would become in &s;ome &s;ort a
Complice of the Crime of particular Men.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> We do not beg of your Maje&s;ty to apply vio|lent
Remedies, to impo&s;e new Puni&s;hments, to render
Hou&s;es de&s;olate, or to cut off Heads, (though all the&s;e
Cha&s;ti&s;ements are much beneath that Fury;) we bear
in Mind the Mildne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who obliges us,
by his Example, to &s;eek the Salvation of Sinners by
the Principle of Charity, and never by that of Ven|geance.
The Church is a Good Mother, which la|bours
for the Conver&s;ion of her Children, and &s;he ne|ver
&s;olicits their Lo&s;s; &s;he asks only of your Maje&s;ty
by my Mouth, that you cut off the E&s;&s;ential Cau&s;e of
the Evil; that you de&s;troy a Contagious Opinion
which Poi&s;ons Spirits; that you highly di&s;credit Du|els;
that you load them with Infamy; that you ba|ni&s;h
from your Pre&s;ence the Guilty; that you deprive
them of your Favours; that you keep the &s;ame Lan|guage
<PB N="22" REF="37">
in your Di&s;cour&s;es as in your Edicts; and that
finally you declare on all Occa&s;ions, that as a Duel is
an Action full of Rage, which has not the Character
of true Valour, &s;o it does not Merit but the Effects of
your Indignation.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> We cannot doubt but your Maje&s;ty will Em|ploy
your Authority and mo&s;t urgent Cares for Re|pre&s;&s;ing
this Unbridled Liberty, and for Advancing
the Pro&s;perity of this State, while we &s;ee the Be&s;t and
Greate&s;t Queen of the World &s;eated near your Maje&s;ty
in your Coun&s;els: It is &s;he who has guided the Ve&s;&s;el
of the State in the mid&s;t of the Tempe&s;t, fortified by
the wi&s;e Councels of this Great Mini&s;ter, who&s;e Spirit
has alway pre&s;ided o'er our Affairs, and who in all
our Agitations has thought much le&s;s on his own An|gers,
than on tho&s;e of the Publick Fortune. It is &s;he who
has merited the Honours which the <HI>Romans</HI> render'd
formerly to tho&s;e who had pre&s;erv'd the Empire, &s;ince
that in deplorable Times, the Imagination of which
&s;trikes a Terrour, &s;he has maintain'd the Crown on
the Head of your Maje&s;ty. Finally, It is the whom
God has given you as the mo&s;t Precious Pledge of his
Love, his Protection being not to be &s;hewn more vi|&s;ibly
than by pre&s;erving to you a Mother full of Ten|derne&s;s
for your Per&s;o$&punc; of Zeal for your State, and of
Experience for your Affairs. <HI>Sir,</HI> Some of the Kings of
<HI>Judah</HI> undertook the De&s;truction of Idols; but through
Humane Con&s;iderations they in &s;ome &s;ort tolerated the
Wor&s;hip. Whence it is that the Holy Scripture, which
prai&s;es <HI>Joas</HI> as a Religious Prince, pre&s;ently fades his
Elogy by this Bloody Reproach: And neverthele&s;s &s;ays
it, he fell into the Error of his Predece&s;&s;ors; for he
did not &s;ubvert the Altars which were rais'd on the
Height of Mountains. Ah! <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;uffer not a Spot like
that of the Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> to darken the Splendor
of your Name; break all to pieces the Idol of fal&s;e
Honour, to which an infinite Number of Souls have
been Sacrificed in the Ages pa&s;t; compleat the Enter|prize
which your Predece&s;&s;ors have only dar'd to be|gin,
and which they left imperfect, happily through
the trouble&s;ome Conjunctures of their Reigns; it
&s;eems al&s;o that God has re&s;erv'd the Glory to your
<PB N="23" REF="38">
Maje&s;ty, by the Advantages which he has rais'd for its
Accompli&s;hment. Give Protection to this Generous
Nobility, who offer their A&s;&s;i&s;tance for the Execution
of &s;o Chri&s;tian a De&s;ign. Confirm the Authority of
your Laws by the Re&s;pectful Sub&s;cription of all the
Great Per&s;ons of your Kingdom, of all the Officers of
your Hou&s;e, and of all tho&s;e generally who have the
Honour of approaching your Augu&s;t Per&s;on. Declare
Solemnly, and as a King, and as a <HI>Brave,</HI> concerning
the Point of true Honour; and finally, for an Accom|pli&s;hment
of a Reputation as Clear as Great, put a
Stop to this Criminal Proof of an Artificial Courage.
We a&s;&s;ure al&s;o your Maje&s;ty, as the Depo&s;itories of the
Divine Promi&s;es, that God by his more particular Fa|vours
will add to the Crown which &s;hines on your
Head a new Glory, which is wi&s;ht to your Maje&s;ty

<HEAD>A Circulatory Letter of the Gentlemen Gover|nours
of the Ho&s;pital of Paris, to the Go|vernours
of the other Ho&s;pitals of France.</HEAD>
<P>GEntlemen, it is now a long time &s;ince Duels have
mole&s;ted <HI>France,</HI> and that each Man has wi&s;ht a
Remedy Powerful enough to put a Stop to this Di&s;|order
&s;o common at pre&s;ent: There is not need of
many Rea&s;ons for conceiving a Horror again&s;t them;
tho' we had not the Zeal of Chri&s;tianity, it would be
enough for us to have &s;ome Sentiments of Humanity,
and not to be ab&s;olute Barbarians; to u&s;e all our Ef|forts,
that Per&s;ons who are well in Health &s;hould no
longer cut their own Throats; and that tho&s;e who
have no Quarrel, &s;hould no longer Sacrifice them&s;elves
to pay the Office of a Friend in the Quality of Se|conds.
It's only in <HI>France</HI> that Men revenge them&s;elves
by the way of Duel; all the other Nations of the
World, either the mo&s;t Generous, the mo&s;t Politick,
<PB N="24" REF="39">
or the mo&s;t Bruti&s;t, ab&s;olutely condemn this Action&punc;
which is a <HI>Mania</HI> of the <HI>French.</HI> If a Per&s;on has re|ceiv'd
an Injury, why &s;hall he farther pro&s;titute his
Life in order to a Satisfaction? Does not the Per&s;on
offended Fight with Arms equal with the Offender?
And does he not put him&s;elf in danger of being
Wounded or Kill'd, or to Beg his Life? Is it not to
expo&s;e a Man's &s;elf to a greater Injury, in&s;tead of re|pairing
the fir&s;t? We have &s;een within this Age
Edicts, Declarations, and Decrees, again&s;t Duels; they
have been put in the Number of the Crimes of High
Trea&s;on; they have been judg'd &s;o Horrid and De|te&s;table,
that the Death of the Dueli&s;ts does not ex|empt
them from Penalties, nor from Shame: To
Condemn them after a more Remarkable Manner
Two Edicts have been Publi&s;ht on Two Glorious
Days; the one, at the coming of the late King
of Happy Memory to the Crown, <HI>Anno</HI> 1610;
and the other at the Majority of our pre&s;ent King
happily Reigning, <HI>Anno</HI> 1651. All the Prohibi|tions
and Penalties have been hitherto to no
Purpo&s;e; and it &s;eems that &s;ince the Prohibi|tions
have been mo&s;t expre&s;s, and the Penalties
mo&s;t &s;evere, Duels are become more frequent, and
the Way of Fighting more Cruel; we have under|&s;tood
that &s;ince &s;ome Time there have been &s;ome
which could not proceed but from Fury and De&s;pair.
The King by his la&s;t Declaration has put in Practice
all the Precautions po&s;&s;ible for &s;topping this impetu|ous
Torrent of Duels; and becau&s;e it is true that
many Per&s;ons cannot come to a Re&s;olution of Pro&s;ecu|ting
by the Way of Ju&s;tice the Reparation of an In|jury,
and that it is not rea&s;onable that Injuries &s;hould
remain Unpuni&s;ht, Expedients have been provided
for &s;atisfying each Man by Ways which con&s;i&s;t with
Honour, without Penalty and Danger. The Mar|&s;hals
of <HI>France,</HI> or the Lords who &s;hall be deputed
in the Provinces, &s;hall give Order to have Ju&s;tice done,
and that it &s;hall be Punctual, without a Man's being
oblig'd to any Formality. This Way is Good and
Innocent, whereas that which a Man takes of him|&s;elf
is Hurtful and Criminal; &s;ince there are good
<PB N="25" REF="40">
Ways for revenging Injuries, tho&s;e who will Revenge
them&s;elves are by &s;o much the le&s;s Excu&s;eable: It is
neverthele&s;s difficult to &s;top this Impetuo&s;ity of the
Pa&s;&s;ion of Duels, which is Unfortunately in U&s;e a|mong
the <HI>French;</HI> wherefore there is need of &s;ome|thing
above all the other Remedies. The King of his
own Inclination, as well as by his Edicts, the Lords
Spiritual in their General A&s;&s;embly, the Lords Mar|&s;hals
of <HI>France</HI> by Particular Articles, and a great
many Lords and Gentlemen by their Submi&s;&s;ions,
and by their Writings under their Hands, concur to
one and the &s;ame End, of no longer &s;paring any thing
for hindring Duels; the Magi&s;trates al&s;o contribute
their Zeal, and u&s;e with Severity the Power of their
Ju&s;tice again&s;t the Guilty. It may po&s;&s;ibly be thought
&s;trange that the Governours of the Ho&s;pitals &s;hould
take Part, and &s;hould concern them&s;elves in this Oc|ca&s;ion,
&s;ince the Cognizance of Duels is very remote
from their Functions: It may be &s;aid, that if Duels
trouble them becau&s;e they offend Religion and Cha|rity,
they may dete&s;t and bewail them, but they can
do no more; that they ought not to take Cognizance
of them, that they ought not even to accu&s;e nor in|form
of the Crimes: Our Intention is not to meddle
with any Thing above our Function: In Truth we
had had Recour&s;e but to Sighs and Tears, in Refe|rence
to Duels, unle&s;s Two Things engag'd us to In|tere&s;t
our &s;elves in them; the one becau&s;e the Poor
have the Third Part of the Goods con$i&s;cated on this
Occa&s;ion, and that we cannot in Con&s;cience neglect
their Intere&s;t; this Rea&s;on alone would not invite
us, but after the Confi&s;cations judg'd, and not before;
but the other is, that by taking at pre&s;ent an exact
Cognizance of Duels, it is not &s;o much an Enterprize
in us as an Act of Obedience we obey the King's In|tentions,
and the Orders of the Powers of the King|dom.
This Service is requir'd of us for the Publick,
we are oblig'd to pay it to avoid &s;o great an Evil as
Duels; what we have Re&s;olv'd, and have begun to
Execute, is approv'd; it is judg'd that an entire Cor|re&s;pondence
betwixt all the Governours of all the
Ho&s;pitals of <HI>Franc$</HI> hath a great Effect; and we are
<PB N="26" REF="41">
a&s;&s;ur'd that as &s;oon as there &s;hall be &s;een an Execution
of our De&s;ign, there will pre&s;ently be reviv'd the o|ther
Overtures which &s;eem for &s;ome Time to have
fall'n a&s;leep, and the Cares will be redoubled for ma|king
the Prote&s;tations which have been made to &s;uc|ceed.
It is to obey the Orders which we have receiv'd
that we inform our &s;elves of the Duels which have
been committed, and of the Rencounters that have
happen'd, &s;ince the Month of <HI>September,</HI> 1651. We
have nominated Five among us as Particular Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
on what concerns Duels. It's to the End
that they may proceed in it with a more &s;ingular Af|fection,
and that the ordinary Affairs of the Body
of the Governours be not interrupted; our Deputies
meet every <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> of each Week; they receive there
Informations; they propo&s;e there what is to be pro|pos'd;
they deliberate there, and conclude of the
Things that pre&s;ent them&s;elves. They have a Parti|cular
Secretary, and a Regi&s;ter of Things Decreed,
which is di&s;tinct from that of our Body; but when
there are Important or Extraordinary Occa&s;ions, the
Report is made in full A&s;&s;embly; and in this Ca&s;e
the Things concluded are &s;et down in the Common
Regi&s;ter, whereof neverthele&s;s mention is made
in that of Duels. We &s;end you, Gentlemen, &s;ome
Extracts of what we have already re&s;olv'd; the In|tent
of our Court is, that to make a Di&s;covery of the
Crime with more Ea&s;e, and to procure &s;ome Good
to the Poor by the Thirds which is appointed for
them, there &s;hall be &s;ome Part of the Thirds given
to tho&s;e who &s;hall give Notice of Duels committed,
obliging us to furni&s;h the Proofs by them, if the Con|viction
cannot be had otherways, and to give by
them Lights of the E&s;$ates, if the Knowledge can|not
otherwi&s;e be had: This &s;hall be done with re|gard
to Circum&s;tances of Things and Per&s;ons. It is
&s;ometimes good to intere&s;s &s;ome one with the Poor;
and in all this Conduct we ought to regard but God
and the Poor; the&s;e are the Sole Motives which ought
to animate us, and the Sole Thoughts which we
ought to have; we &s;hall &s;o do that nothing may be
imputed nor reproacht to the Admini&s;trators of the
<PB N="27" REF="42">
Ho&s;pital of <HI>Paris,</HI> and even to &s;ecure our &s;elves as
much as we may, both from a Default and Negli|gence.
We Promi&s;e our &s;elves, Gentlemen, as much
or more on your Part, &s;ince we are a&s;&s;ur'd of the
Piety of your Employ, whence we ea&s;ily pre&s;ume,
and as it were nece&s;&s;arily, the Sincerity of your Inten|tions,
and all that may depend of it. If the fir&s;t Let|ter
which we writ to you has not had all the Succe&s;s
that was expected, we are chiefly the Cau&s;e, either
for not having &s;ufficiently explain'd our &s;elves, or for
not having opened enough the Motives, the Con&s;e|quences
and the Effects, of the De&s;ign, which ought
to be common betwixt us; we do it at pre&s;ent, and
we pray you, Gentlemen, to inform us of all the
Duels which have been committed in your Town and
the Neighbourhood &s;ince the Month of <HI>September,</HI>
1651; and to continue your Informations for the fu|ture,
if any &s;hall be committed henceforward, and to
&s;et down the Per&s;ons, the Conditions and the E&s;tates,
of tho&s;e who have Fought; of tho&s;e who have
&s;ent or given Challenges; of their Seconds, or the
greate&s;t Number of them; of the Dead and Wound|ed;
what are their Parents and Allies, their Credit
or their Support, in the Province; we do not ask only
a$ Corre&s;pondence of the Gentlemen Governours of the
Ho&s;pitals, who are within the reach of the Parlia|ment
of <HI>Paris,</HI> we ask it al&s;o of the Gentlemen
Governours of the Ho&s;pitals of the Towns where
there is a Parliament, and we &s;upply them to write
to the Gentlemen Governours of the Ho&s;pitals which
are within the Limits of their Parliament, to the End
there may be a like Corre&s;pondence betwixt them,
and that by thus doing it be Univer&s;al throughout the
Kingdom. We may by this Means root out, or
cau&s;e to be puni&s;ht, a Crime with offends God
and the King, the Publick and our Neighbour,
and which makes us de&s;pair of the Salvati|on,
as well as of the Life, of tho&s;e who commit it.
We may conclude of having for Ob&s;tacles Per&s;ons of
all Qualities, of all Humours, and of all Ages; be|cau&s;e
there is now almo&s;t no one, either of the Pea&s;ants
or Nobility, of the Soldiery, and even of Serving-men,
<PB N="28" REF="43">
as well as of Gentlemen, and of all others who make
Profe&s;&s;ion of Arms, but will revenge his Quarrel, or give
a Te&s;timony of his Valour, by a Duel: We mu&s;t try to
undeceive this fal&s;e Genero&s;ity, to overcome all the
Difficulties, to be ob&s;tinately re&s;olv'd in &s;o Pious and
&s;o Holy an Enterprize, and to &s;tand firm again&s;t all
Sorts of Prayers and Con&s;iderations: We Promi&s;e you,

the King, the Court, and all tho&s;e who have a lawful
Authority to Command, Prohibit, and Puni&s;h: We
Promi&s;e you an A&s;&s;iduou&s;ne&s;s without Remi&s;&s;ion, an
inflexible Vigour, and that entire Corre&s;pondence
which we ask al&s;o of you, for the better upholding
us in it, it is good for us all to be known: We entreat
you, Gentlemen, that when you &s;hall do us the Ho|nour
to write to us, you will &s;ignifie to us by your
Letters, or by a particular Memoir, the Names, Qua|lities,
and the Number of your Body, whether your
Government be Perpetual, or for a Time? When,
how&punc; and by whom the Changes are made in it? if
the Church, the Magi&s;trates, or other Officers, have
Part in it, either of Nece&s;&s;ity, or Choice? whether
there are Bodies or Commonalties under which they
are? or whether there be an entire Liberty of chu|&s;ing
all Sorts of P$r&s;ons, and of all Sorts of Profe&s;&s;ions?
To &s;end us word al&s;o what Order you will keep in this
Matter, and to whom of your Company we mu&s;t Ad|dre&s;s
us? Or wh$ther we &s;hall continue to write to
your entire Body? We would not draw any Thing
from you but what you may know of us. After ha|ving
given you to under&s;tand what we have Re&s;olv'd,
and begun to Execute, whereof we &s;end you &s;ome
Extracts, we Inform you of our Government: It is
at pre&s;ent compos'd of Sixteen Per&s;ons; the Lord
fir&s;t Pre&s;ident of the Parliament is alway the Chief:
We have alway had the Happine&s;s to have a Head
greatly affected to the Body of Governours. The Lord
fir&s;t Pre&s;ident <HI>de Bellieure,</HI> lately Deceas'd, whom no
one can enough Lament, nor Prai&s;e, has given very
Powerful Te&s;timonies by his Pre&s;ence with the Body,
by his Councils at Home, and by his Reputation on all
<PB N="29" REF="44">
Occa&s;ions; he confirm'd them the Day before his De|cea&s;e,
by the Rich Pre&s;ent he made to the Poor of the
Ho&s;pital of the Precious Furniture of his Chamber:
God having taken him from us, we hope in his Place
a worthy Succe&s;&s;or. We have ordinarily with the
Lord fir&s;t Pre&s;ident of the Parliament, the Lords fir&s;t
Pre&s;idents of the Chamber of Accounts, and of the
Court of Aids. There are be&s;ide the Lords of the
Sovereign Companies in the Number of the others,
which are nominated by the Company, according as
there is a vacant Place by Death. We are all Sworn in
the great Chamber; and tho' our Employ be during
Life, it may be &s;aid with Truth, that each Man is
very zealous of employing there all his Time and his
Care. We &s;end you the Li&s;t of tho&s;e who compo&s;e
the Body of Judicature. We have a Receiver and a
Regi&s;ter. The u&s;ual great Number of the Di&s;eas'd,
of Per&s;ons, and of Things nece&s;&s;ary for the Sub&s;i&s;tence
and Maintenance of the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Paris,</HI> obliges us to
have a great many Officers and Dome&s;ticks. It is true,
the Revenue is con&s;iderable; but we owe it to the
Particular Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, that tho' the Disbur&s;e|ments
exceed the Revenue above a Hundred Thou&s;and
Livres each Year, which is a Truth not known to e|very
one, but very ea&s;ie to ju&s;tifie, the Hou&s;e neverthe|le&s;s
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts; we daily acknowledge Sorts of Miracles
both in its Government, and in extraordinary Favours.
Behold, Gentlemen, the Account we give you, both
very Punctual, and very Sincere; we hope from you
that you will give us a Light of your Government as
True and Faithful. We beg the Grace that we may
have all a Re&s;olution and Strength in an Occa&s;ion &s;o
Laudable, as that of hindring Duels, whereby we
may Serve God and the King, the Publick and our
Neighbour. We &s;hould Serve at the &s;ame Time tho&s;e
who would De&s;troy them&s;elves, having an Intention
to Fight: We Pray them to reflect on Them&s;elves,
and not to put Them&s;elves in a Condition that
we may have a Right to ask for the Poor the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their E&s;tates: We Pray them to con|&s;ider
how favourable the Poor are, and that they
&s;hall be well grounded to make this Demand of
<PB N="30" REF="45">
their E&s;tates on the Account of the King's Declaration:
And if they are not concern'd for being Indebted to
God, to the King, and to the Publick, let them be
concern'd at lea&s;t becau&s;e they are Indebted to their
Per&s;ons, to their Honour, and to their Salvation; to
their Wives, if Married; to their Children, if they
are Fathers; and to their Hou&s;e, if they are Generous
and Rea&s;onable: Let them &s;uffer them&s;elves to be con|vinc'd
by a Truth which &s;eems to be out of Doubt,
that it is glorious to &s;erve his Prince in the Army,
but that it is &s;hameful to Peri&s;h by Single Combats,
as Duels are. If a Man will expo&s;e him&s;elf to Die
with his Arms in his Hand, it ought to be for the
Service of the King and Kingdom, and not for a Quar|rel,
or for a Pa&s;&s;ion. What Mi&s;chief, and what Hor|rour,
for a Man to render him&s;elf in a Moment Un|happy
and Mi&s;erable! When there is Que&s;tion of the
lea&s;t Important Affair in a Family, where there may
be a Concern of Fortune, Relations are gathered toge|ther,
Things are Propos'd and Deliberated of. When
there is a Que&s;tion of Health, as of the lea&s;t Indi&s;po&s;i|tion
of Body, recour&s;e is made to the Advice of Phy|&s;icians,
and Per&s;ons apply them&s;elves to the &s;earch of
all Remedies for getting Relief. When there is Que|&s;tion
of a Point of Con&s;cience, Men apply them&s;elves
to their Directors: And in this Occa&s;ion where the
whole lo&s;s of Fortune, Life, and Salvation, is con|cern'd,
all is left to Hazard without Deliberating, all
is left at Random without making any Propo&s;ition,
and Men withdraw them&s;elves privately from all the
World, le&s;t they be diverted from lo&s;ing in an In&s;tant
all that may lo&s;e for ever a Man and a Chri&s;tian. Re|pre&s;ent
to your&s;elves, Gentlemen, a Man in a State
of Fighting, in which State he is in the Action of a
Duel, and his State after the Duel; this Courage in
which he &s;o much Glories is but the Appearance of
a Genero&s;ity, and the true Effect of a Criminal Cow|ardice,
as not being able to &s;uffer a Contempt, an In|jury,
or a Word; and refu&s;ing to u&s;e the Ways which
the King pre&s;cribes for a Reparation. He cau&s;es a
Challenge to be given, he goes to the Place appointed;
<PB N="31" REF="46">
he that receives the Challenge goes there al&s;o, both
contemn their Lives and the King's Edicts; the one
becau&s;e he believes him&s;elf Offended, and the other
becau&s;e he imagines his Honour is concerned not to
refu&s;e a Challenge. Nay, there is &s;ometimes &s;o much
Imprudence in it, that Men pro&s;titute them&s;elves
without there being any Injury, or Ill De&s;ign in Word
or Deed: And mean while he that thinks him&s;elf Of|fended,
forgets all; not &s;o much for drawing thence
a Satisfaction, which would &s;till be a Thing Unju&s;t,
as for running upon Danger, which is the la&s;t of all
Extremities: And in which he engages his Friend,
who was not concern'd, which is the chief of all Fol|lies.
They will all do an Action of Prudence and Se|cre&s;ie,
by withdrawing them&s;elves privily from all the
World to Fight, that they may neither have Relief
nor Witne&s;&s;es: So that if the Act of Duelling be
Glorious, there is no Man who can give a Faithful
Te&s;timony of it; and they take no Witne&s;&s;es, becau&s;e
it is a Shame to Fight. It is not enough to commit a
Shameful Action, they are be&s;ide depriv'd of all Kinds
of A&s;&s;i&s;tances at a Time in which there may be mo&s;t
Need. As they abandon God, their Family, and
them&s;elves, they will be abandon'd by all Men. If
they dive&s;t them&s;elves of their Cloaths, it's a &s;ign
that they depo&s;e all Sen&s;e; and the Shift which is
kept on is the Symbol of the Fooli&s;h Vanity which is
re&s;erv'd, and which is not depos'd by them but at
Death. If there be &s;ome other Pa&s;&s;ion, it's only that
of Peri&s;hing: For what&s;oever happens of it, it's al|way
to Peri&s;h. The Preparatives for this Action are
but In&s;truments for Peri&s;hing: There are carried there
but Swords, Daggers, Knives, and of late Pi&s;tols, or
other Fire-Arms. Is it not to Peri&s;h to be reduc'd to
beg Life when you would take it away? If a Man
has the Advantage of the Field by killing his Man,
he is con&s;train'd to fly, he mu&s;t quit his Hou&s;e, his
Family, his Country, and his E&s;tate, to &s;ave him&s;elf.
It is not difficult to imagine the Di&s;quiet, Remor&s;es,
Griefs, Troubles, and Sufferings, of a Fugitive. Now
all Hopes mu&s;t be lo&s;t of obtaining Favour, or Letters
<PB N="32" REF="47">
in the Ca&s;e of Duels, for any Per&s;ons what&s;oever.
A Man mu&s;t no longer take a Re&s;olution of Fighting,
but he mu&s;t make a Reflection on the Nece&s;&s;ity of
Peri&s;hing. It may be &s;aid of Peri&s;hing, &s;ince that for
a Moment of Revenge there remains but a continual
Affliction, and without Hope for the Re&s;t of the Life.
If a Man dies in the Field, is it not to peri&s;h more,
&s;ince that a Man cannot peri&s;h more than by Death?
And &s;ince that it is not Dying as a Man, nor as a Chri|&s;tian?
It is not Dying as a Man to Die a violent
Death, procur'd by a Man's Self; to Die De&s;pairing,
to Die Overthrown or De&s;troy'd by his Enemy, lying
along on the Du&s;t, on the Gra&s;s, or on the Dung|hil;
to bite the Earth, and all that is in his way;
to be more concern'd at his Impotency of Execu|ting
his Pa&s;&s;ion, than of thinking of what ought
more nearly to touch him; and to vomit forth his
Blood and Soul at the &s;ame Time that he vomits
forth his Anger and his Rage. It is not to Die as a
Chri&s;tian, not to Lament his Sins, and not to be Pe|nitent
before he Dies. Alas! how far is a Man re|mote
from that State, when he &s;ets upon all Things
again&s;t the Commandments of God, and again&s;t the
Prohibitions of his Prince. Dying in De&s;pair a Man
dies in a Crime, and it's a double Crime for a Man
to Die in a De&s;ign of Revenge. The gaping Wounds
are not Mouths for Prayer, nor for asking Mercy; but
only Mouths of Bla&s;phemies, and Breaches for Death.
As we make a Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, can we think
without Horrour, what Eternity this Moment pro|duces?
the Carca&s;s is left on the Earth; and if it be
taken up, it's only by the Enemy to hide it, or by
a Servant, or by the Hand of Ju&s;tice: Ju&s;tice mu&s;t
be deceiv'd, that the Body may not receive a new
Ignominy after Death; the Church mu&s;t be deceiv'd,
that it may be Buried in Holy Ground; the Publick
mu&s;t be deceiv'd, if the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his E&s;tate may
be pre&s;erv'd to his Children, or Relations; finally, the
Judges and Witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t be deceiv'd, that the Me|mory
of the Defunct be not Condemn'd. But if the
Crime be too well known, and the Confi&s;cation be
inevitable, Friends mu&s;t be &s;ought to for Obtaining
<PB N="33" REF="48">
of the King the Confi&s;cation, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the E&s;tates of the Living and of the Dead, without
Gift, Will, or any Title of Succe&s;&s;ion, and without
having any Obligation either to the Liberality of tho&s;e
that po&s;&s;e&s;t them, or to the Benefit of the Law; but
there mu&s;t be no longer Hope of this la&s;t Comfort,
which remain'd to Relations: The Third of the E|&s;tates
of tho&s;e who have fought a Duel belongs to the
Governours of the Ho&s;pitals, and it cannot be touch'd:
A Third belongs to the Informers, which it will be
endeavour'd that they &s;hall keep: As to the other
Third, it is appointed for the Charge, which will in
a manner alway con&s;ume it, or at lea&s;t for the great|e&s;t
part; &s;o that the&s;e are Lo&s;&s;es without Recovery,
which each Man ought to apprehend, tho' the other
Puni&s;hments were not to be fear'd. Excu&s;e us, Gen|tlemen,
for that in a Letter we fully point forth to
you Duels and their Con&s;equences; tho' this pa&s;&s;es
the Bounds of a Letter, and it's but a weak and im|perfect
Draught of a Publick Truth, po&s;&s;ibly this
Enterprize may not be wholly u&s;ele&s;s: It is not e|nough
that a Crime which we have to oppo&s;e be
known to us, all the Circum&s;tances of it mu&s;t be re|pre&s;ented,
to fortifie us in our De&s;ign; we &s;hall make
greater Efforts to procure a greater Good, when we
&s;hall have pre&s;ent in our Thoughts the Exce&s;s of the
Evil which we will hinder. Haply al&s;o the&s;e Letters
may fall into the Hands of Per&s;ons who may be in a
Di&s;po&s;ition to do it, and who will make a Reflection
on it before they will commit it; they will think that
if they fall into this Misfortune, they &s;hall have in a
manner as many Parties or Informers again&s;t them as
there are Governours of Ho&s;pitals in <HI>France,</HI> who be|ing
United in Innocence, Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, will be
much more Powerful than a Particular Per&s;on, or than
all the Relations and Friends of a Guilty Per&s;on.
Think of it well, Gentlemen, and let us all think of
it. Let us con&s;ider that it is to plea&s;e God, the King,
and the Publick; that we &s;hall not do a Thing as not
appertaining to our Functions by Hindring a Di&s;order,
which makes many Widows, and many Orphans. We
may contribute to the Pre&s;erving of a Husband to a
<PB N="34" REF="49">
Wife, of a Father to Children, of Children to their
Father, of a Relation to his Relation, of a Friend to
his Friend: We may bring it to pa&s;s, that young Gen|tlemen
and young Lords may give to the Exerci&s;es of
Vertue, or at lea&s;t to Vertuous Companies, what they
employ in the Maintenance of Gladiators, and in Dan|gerous
Sollicitations. We &s;hall participate in the Good
which the State and particular Per&s;ons will receive by
it. We may by this means merit in this World,
receive in the other a Recompence. We are all
convinc'd of the Di&s;order, and of the Good: We
humbly pray you, Gentlemen, to have the &s;ame Sen|timents

<HEAD>An Edict of the King, containing a General

<P>LOuis, <HI>by the Grace of God King of</HI> France <HI>and</HI> Na|varre:
To all the pre&s;ent and to come, <HI>Greeting:</HI>
As we acknowledge that one of the greate&s;t Favours
which we have receiv'd from God, in the Govern|ment
and Encouragement of our State, con&s;i&s;ts in the
Firmne&s;s which he has been pleas'd to give us for
Maintaining the Prohibitions of Duels and Single
Combats, and &s;everely Puni&s;h tho&s;e who have con|traven'd
to a Law &s;o Ju&s;t and &s;o Nece&s;&s;ary for the
Pre&s;ervation of our Nobility; we are throughly re|&s;olv'd
to cultivate with Care &s;o particular a Favour,
<PB N="35" REF="50">
which gives us ground to hope that we may be able
to arrive, during our Reign, to the Aboli&s;hment of this
Crime, after having been attempted in vain by the
Kings, our Predece&s;&s;ors. For this Effect, we have
apply'd our&s;elves anew to examine well all the Edicts
and Ordinances made again&s;t Duels, and all that has
been done con&s;equentially to them, to which we have
judg'd it nece&s;&s;ary to add divers Articles. For the&s;e
Cau&s;es, and other Good and Great Con&s;iderations
moving us thereunto, with the Advice of our Privy-Council,
and through our certain Knowledge, full
Power and Royal Authority, after having examin'd
in our &s;aid Council what our mo&s;t Dear and Well-beloved
Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> who have
met together oftentimes on this Subject have pro|pos'd
to us: We, by Renewing the Prohibitions made
by our Edicts and Ordinances, and tho&s;e of the Kings,
our Predece&s;&s;ors, and by adding what we have judg'd
nece&s;&s;ary, have &s;aid, declar'd, concluded and ordain'd,
and by our pre&s;ent Edict, which &s;hall be perpetual and
irrevocable, we &s;ay, declare, conclude and ordain, it
is our Will and Plea&s;ure,</P>
<P>I. We Exhort all our Subjects, and enjoin them to
live for the future together in that Peace, Union and
Concord, which is nece&s;&s;ary for their Pre&s;ervation, and
for that of their Families, and the State, under Pain
of incurring our Indignation, and our Exemplary
Cha&s;ti&s;ement: We enjoin them al&s;o to give the Re|&s;pect
becoming each one, according to his Quality,
Rank, and Dignity, and to u&s;e mutually one with a|nother
all that &s;hall lye in them, for preventing all
Differences, Debates and Quarrels, e&s;pecially tho&s;e
which may be follow'd by Ways of Fact, to give each
other &s;incerely, and <HI>bona fide,</HI> all the right Under&s;tand|ing
nece&s;&s;ary, upon the Complaints and Di&s;&s;atisfacti|ons
which may happen betwixt them, to hinder
coming to Action in any way what&s;oever; declaring,
that we &s;hall repute this Proceeding for an Effect of
the Obedience which is due to us, and which we hold
to be mo&s;t conformable to the Maxims of True Ho|nour,
as well as to tho&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, no Per&s;on
being able to di&s;pence him&s;elf from this mutual Cha|rity
<PB N="36" REF="51">
without Action, contrary to the Commandments
of God as well as ours.</P>
<P>II. And fora&s;much as there is nothing &s;o laudable,
nor which gains more the Affections of the Publick,
and of private Per&s;ons, than to &s;top the Cour&s;e of
Duels in their Source, We enjoin our mo&s;t Dear and
Well beloved Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> whe|ther
they are attending on us, or in our Provinces,
and the Governours-General of our Provinces, and in
their Ab&s;ence the Lieutenants-General in the &s;ame, to
employ them&s;elves very diligently, and with all rea|dine&s;s,
in ending all the Differences which may hap|pen
betwixt our Subjects, by the Ways, and, as they
are Impower'd, by the Edicts and Ordinances of the
Kings, our Predece&s;&s;ors. And moreover, we Impow|er
our &s;aid Cou&s;ins to appoint in each of the Baili|wicks
or Sene&s;chalties of our Kingdom, one or more
Gentlemen, according to their Extent, who may be
of Quality, Age and Capacity, requi&s;ite for receiving
Informations of Differences which may happen be|twixt
Gentlemen, Soldiers, and others of our Subjects,
to &s;end them to our &s;aid Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of
<HI>France,</HI> or to the Elde&s;t of them, or to the Gover|nours-General
of our Provinces, and our Lieutenants-General
of the &s;ame, when they &s;hall be there pre|&s;ent;
and we Impower the &s;aid Gentlemen who
&s;hall be &s;o Deputed to cau&s;e to be brought before
them&s;elves, in the Ab&s;ence of the Governours, and
our &s;aid Lieutenants-General, all tho&s;e who &s;hall have
any Difference, to bring them to an Agreement, or to
&s;end them before our &s;aid Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of
<HI>France,</HI> in ca&s;e that either of the Parties finds him&s;elf
grieved by the Agreement propos'd by the &s;aid Gen|tlemen,
or will not &s;ubmit him&s;elf to their Judg|ments.
And when the &s;aid Governours-General of
our Provinces, and our Lieutenants-General of the
&s;ame, &s;hall be in the Provinces, in ca&s;e the Quarrels
which &s;hall happen &s;hall require a &s;peedy Remedy for
Hindring what may follow, and that the Governours
are ab&s;ent from the Place where the Difference &s;hall
happen, it is our Will that the Gentlemen deputed
take Care in it at the very In&s;tant, and cau&s;e to be
<PB N="37" REF="52">
Executed what is contain'd in the Articles of the
pre&s;ent Edict, whereof they &s;hall give Information
at the In&s;tant to the &s;aid Governours-General of our
Provinces; or, in their Ab&s;ence, to the Lieutenants-General
in them, to labour ince&s;&s;antly for an Ac|commodation:
And for this Effect we mo&s;t expre&s;ly
charge all Provo&s;t Mar&s;hals, Under-Bailiffs, Under-Stewards,
their Lieutenants, Exempts, Clerks and
Officers, faithfully and readily to obey, under Pain of
Seque&s;tration of their Offices, and Deprivation of
their Wages, the &s;aid Gentlemen deputed for the ta|king
Cognizance of the &s;aid Differences, whether
tho&s;e who Quarrel be to be Summoned, made Pri|&s;oners,
their Goods Seized and E&s;treated, or any other
nece&s;&s;ary Acts be to be done for Hindering the Ways
of Fact, and Executing the Orders of the &s;aid Gen|tlemen
&s;o committed, and all at the Co&s;t and Charges
of the Parties.</P>
<P>III. Furthermore We declare, That all who &s;hall
be pre&s;ent, or &s;hall meet, though accidentally, in the
Places where Offences again&s;t Honour &s;hall be com|mitted,
whereby Reports or Injurious Di&s;cour&s;es, by
Breach of Promi&s;e, or Word pa&s;t, by Giving the Lie,
Blows, or other Outrages, of what Nature &s;oever they
be, &s;hall be obliged for the future to give Notice of
the &s;ame to our Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> or
the &s;aid Governours-General of our Provinces, and
our Lieutenant-Generals in the &s;ame, or the Gentle|men
deputed by our &s;aid Cou&s;ins, under Pain of be|ing
reputed Complices in the &s;aid Offences, and of be|ing
Pro&s;ecuted, as having tacitly contributed there|unto,
for not having endeavoured to prevent the bad
Con&s;equences of the &s;ame. It is in like manner Our
Will and Plea&s;ure, That they who &s;hall be acquainted
with any Beginning of Quarrels and Animo&s;ities, oc|ca&s;ioned
by Suits that are like to be intended betwixt
Gentlemen, for any Important Intere&s;t, be obliged
for the future to give Notice thereof to our &s;aid Cou|&s;ins,
the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> or the Governours-Ge|neral
of our &s;aid Provinces, and the Lieutenant-Ge|nerals
of the &s;ame; or in their Ab&s;ence, to the Gen|tlemen
deputed in the Ba$liwicks, to the end they may
<PB N="38" REF="53">
with all their Power hinder the Parties from leaving
the ordinary Cour&s;e of Civil Ju&s;tice, and coming to
the Ways of Fact. And that we may be the better
informed of all the Duels and Combats that happen
in Our Provinces, We charge the Governours-General,
and Lieutenant-Generals of the &s;ame, to give Advice
to the Secretaries of State, every one in his own Pre|cincts,
of all the Duels and Combats that &s;hall hap|pen
within the Limits of their Juri&s;diction, to the
fir&s;t Pre&s;idents of Our Courts of Parliament, and to
Our Attorneys-General in the &s;ame; in like manner to
give Advice to our dearly Beloved and Tru&s;ty, the
Sieur <HI>le Tellier,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>France,</HI> and the Gentle|men
deputed, and Officers of the Mar&s;hal&s;eas, to the
Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> that they may in their &s;everal
Places and Stations give Us Information of the &s;ame.
We al&s;o Command all Our Subjects to give Us Advice
thereof, by &s;uch Ways as they &s;hall think fit, Pro|mi&s;ing
to Reward tho&s;e who &s;hall give Notice of Com|bats
happening in the Provinces, whereof we have
received no Advice from other Hands, with the Means
of having the Proof thereof.</P>
<P>IV. When our &s;aid Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI>
the Governours-General of Our Provinces, and Our
Lieutenants-Generals in the &s;ame, in their Ab&s;ence, or
the Gentlemen deputed, &s;hall have Information of any
Difference among&s;t Gentlemen, and among&s;t all tho&s;e
that make Profe&s;&s;ion of Arms, within Our Kingdom
and Countries under Our Obedience, which proceed|ing
from Outrageous Words, or other Cau&s;es relating
to Honour, may be like to incline them to &s;ome extra|ordinary
Re&s;entment, Our &s;aid Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals
of <HI>France,</HI> &s;hall forth with &s;end expre&s;s Prohibitions
to the Parties, that directly or indirectly they demand
Satisfaction of one another by the Ways of Fact, and
&s;hall cau&s;e them to be cited to appear immediately be|fore
them, that there they may be adju&s;ted. And if
they apprehend that the &s;aid Parties be &s;o incen&s;ed,
that they will not give the Re&s;pect and Deference
which they owe to their Orders, they &s;hall pre&s;ently
&s;end them Officers and Guards of the Con&s;tabulary
and Mar&s;hal&s;ea of <HI>Fra$c$,</HI> to wait upon their Per&s;ons,
<PB N="39" REF="54">
at the Co&s;t and Charge of the &s;aid Parties, until they
have appeared before them; which &s;hall be likewi&s;e
practi&s;ed by the Governours-General of our Provinces,
and our Lieutenant-Generals in the &s;ame, within the
Extent of their Governments and Charges; by cau&s;ing
tho&s;e who have any Quarrel to be cited before them,
or &s;ending &s;ome of their Guards or other Per&s;ons to
wait upon them, to hinder them from coming to the
Ways of Fact: And We give Power to the Gentlemen
deputed in every Bailiwick, in Ab&s;ence of the Mar&s;hals
of <HI>France,</HI> Governours-General of our Provinces, and
our Lieutenant-Generals in the &s;ame, to take the &s;ame
Cour&s;e with tho&s;e who have Quarrels, and to make
U&s;e of Provo&s;t-Mar&s;hals, their Lieutenants and Offi|cers,
for the Execution of their Orders.</P>
<P>V. They who &s;hall have Quarrels, appearing before
our Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> or Governours-General
of Our Provinces, and Lieutenants in the
&s;ame, or in their Ab&s;ence before the &s;aid Gentlemen,
if any a$rocious Injury appear to have been committed
with Advantage, either out of a Premeditated De&s;ign
or Frolick, Our Will and Meaning is. That the Party
Offended receive &s;o Advantageous Reparation and Sa|tisfaction,
that he have full Cau&s;e to re&s;t Satisfied;
Confirming, as much is needful, by this our Pre&s;ent
Edict, the Authority given by the Decea&s;ed Kings,
Our mo&s;t Honoured Grandfather and Father, to Our
&s;aid Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> to Judge and
Decide, by Sovereign and Definitive Sentence, all Dif|ferences
concerning the Point of Honour, and Repa|ration
of Offences, whether they happen in our Court,
or any other Place of our Provinces, where they &s;hall
be, and to the &s;aid Governours or Lieutenant-Gene|rals,
the Power which they have al&s;o given them for
the &s;ame end, every one within the Extent of his Ju|ri&s;diction.</P>
<P>VI. And becau&s;e &s;ometimes Offences are committed
which &s;o much concern Honour, that not only the Per|&s;ons
who receive them are thereby Injured, but al&s;o
the Re&s;pect that is due to our Laws and Ordinances
manife&s;tly Violated: We will that tho&s;e who &s;hall
commit &s;uch like Offences, be&s;ides the Satisfactions
<PB N="40" REF="55">
Ordained in Regard of the Per&s;ons Offended, be like|wi&s;e
Condemned by the &s;aid Judges of the Point of
Honour&punc; to &s;uffer Impri&s;onments, Bani&s;hments and
Fines. Con&s;idering al&s;o, That there is nothing more
Unrea&s;onable, or contrary to the Profe&s;&s;ion of Honour,
than the Outrage that may be committed upon Occa|&s;ion
of &s;ome Civil Intere&s;t, or &s;ome Law-&s;uit com|menc'd
before the Ordinary Judges: It is our Will
and Plea&s;ure, that in the Accommodations of Offences,
proceeding from &s;uch Cau&s;es, the &s;aid Judges of the
Point of Honour u&s;e all the Rigour that they &s;hall
think rea&s;onable for the Satisfaction of the Party Of|fended;
and that for the Reparation of our Authori|ty,
thereby Wounded, they Ordain either Impri&s;on|ment
during the &s;pace of Three Months, or le&s;s, or
Bani&s;hment for &s;o long Time from the Places where the
Offender has his Re&s;idence, or the Lo&s;s of One or Two
Years Revenue of the Matter di&s;puted.</P>
<P>VII. Seeing many Differences happen among&s;t Gen|tlemen,
becau&s;e of Hunting, honorary Rights of
Churches, and other Preheminences of Mannors and
Lord&s;hips, as being nearly related to the Point of Ho|nour;
Our Will and Plea&s;ure is, That our &s;aid Cou|&s;ins,
the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> the Governours of our
Provinces, and our Lieutenants in the &s;ame, and the
Gentlemen deputed in the &s;aid Ba$liwicks, or Stewar|ties,
u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to oblige the Par|ties
to agree upon Arbitrators, who may with them
judge &s;ummarily without Formalities the Ground of
&s;uch like Differences, re&s;erving &s;till the Right of Ap|peal
to our Courts of Parliament, when one of the
Parties &s;hall find him&s;elf Wronged by the Verdict of
the Arbitrators.</P>
<P>VIII. In ca&s;e a Gentleman refu&s;e, or without law|ful
Cau&s;e delay, to obey the Orders of our Cou&s;ins, the
Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> or of the other Judges of the Point
of Honour, as not to appear before them, when he hath
been cited either Per&s;onally, or at his Dwelling-Hou&s;e&punc;
and al&s;o when he hath not &s;ubmitted to the Bani&s;h|ment
impo&s;ed upon him, he &s;hall forthwith be Forced
to it, after a certain Time pre&s;cribed to him by the
&s;aid Judges, either by a Gar$i&s;on put into his Hou&s;e$
<PB N="41" REF="56">
or by the Impri&s;onment of his Per&s;on: Which &s;hall
be carefully put in Execution by the Provo&s;ts of our
&s;aid Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> Under-Bailiffs,
Under-Stewards, their Lieutenants, Exempts and Of|ficers,
upon Pain of Seque&s;tration of their Offices, and
Lo&s;s of their Wages, according to the Ordinances of
the &s;aid Judges; and the &s;aid Execution &s;hall be made
at the Co&s;t and Charges of the Di&s;obedient and Refra|ctory
Party. And if the &s;aid Provo&s;ts, Under-Bailiffs,
Under Stewards, their Lieutenants&punc; Exempts and Of|ficers,
cannot execute the &s;aid Impri&s;onment, they
&s;hall Seize and E&s;treat all the Revenues of the &s;aid Ba|ni&s;hed
or Di&s;obedient Per&s;on, to be applied, and re|main
as acquired during the whole Time of his Di&s;o|bedience;
to wit, one half to the Ho&s;pital of the
Town where there is a Parliament E&s;tabli&s;hed, and
the other to the Ho&s;pitals of the Place where there is
a Royal Seat, under the Juri&s;diction of which Parlia|ment,
or Royal Seat, the Goods of the &s;aid Bani&s;hed
or Di&s;obedient Per&s;on &s;hall be; to the End, that mu|tually
a&s;&s;i&s;ting one another in the Pro&s;ecution, the one
may &s;upply the Advice and Proof, and the other in|terpo&s;e
our Authority by that of Ju&s;tice, for the Effect
of our Intention. And in Ca&s;e there be preceding
Debts that hinder the Uplifting of the &s;aid Revenue,
applicable to the Profit of the &s;aid Ho&s;pitals, the Sum
to which it amounts &s;hall be charged as a Debt upon
all the Chattels of the Party Bani&s;hed, to be pay'd
and di&s;charged in Cour&s;e from the Day of the Sen|tence
pa&s;s'd again&s;t him.</P>
<P>IX. Moreover, we Ordain that tho&s;e who have
been put under the Guards of our Cou&s;ins, the Mar|&s;hals
of <HI>France,</HI> the Governours-General of our Pro|vinces,
and our Lieutenants in the &s;ame, or of the
&s;aid Gentlemen deputed, and who &s;hall make their E|&s;cape
in what Manner &s;oever, &s;hall be &s;everely Puni&s;h|ed,
and not admitted to Accommodation upon the
Point of Honour, till tho&s;e that have been Guilty of
the &s;aid E&s;cape or Breach of Guard have been put in
Pri&s;on, and at the In&s;tance of our Proctor in the Con|&s;tabulary,
and of the Sub&s;titutes of the other Mar&s;hal|&s;eas
of <HI>France,</HI> proceeded again&s;t according to the Forms
<PB N="42" REF="57">
required by our Ordinances. It is our Will and Plea|&s;ure,
That upon the Information or Report of the
Guards that have been appointed to keep them, with|out
any other Information, they be &s;entenced at the
In&s;tance of the &s;aid Sub&s;titutes, and their Proce&s;s &s;um|marily
made.</P>
<P>X. Though the Care we take of the Honour of our
Nobility &s;ufficiently appears by the Contents of the
foregoing Articles, and by our &s;olicitous Search of the
Means that are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t proper for &s;tifling
Quarrels in their Birth, and laying upon tho&s;e who
Offend the Blame and Shame which they de&s;erve;
being neverthele&s;s apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome may &s;till be
&s;o Bold as to contravene our Will and Plea&s;ure &s;o ex|pre&s;ly
Declared, and pre&s;ume that they have Rea&s;on to
&s;eek to Revenge them&s;elves, We Will and Command,
that he, who thinking him&s;elf injured, &s;hall give a
Challenge to any Man upon his own Account, &s;hall for
ever forfeit his Right of obtaining Satisfaction for the
Offence that he may pretend to have received, be kept
in Pri&s;on for the &s;pace of Two Years, and condemned
in a Fine to the Ho&s;pital of the Town next to the Place
of his Abode, which is not to be of le&s;s Value than the
half of one Year's Rent of his E&s;tate, and be&s;ides, that
he be &s;u&s;pended from all his Offices, and deprived of
the Profit of them for Three Years. We permit
all Judges to heighten the &s;aid Penalties according as
the Conditions of the Per&s;ons, the Grounds of the
Quarrels, as Suits commenced, or other Civil Intere&s;ts,
the Prohibitions violated, or E&s;capes made, the Cir|cum&s;tances
of Places and Times, &s;hall render the Chal|lenge
more Puni&s;hable. And if he that is Challenged,
in&s;tead of refu&s;ing the Challenge, and of giving Notice
of it to our Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> or to the
Governours-General of our Provinces, and our Lieu|tenants
in the &s;ame, or to the Gentlemen deputed, as
we do enjoin him to do, go to the Place a&s;&s;igned, or
Attempts to do &s;o, he be Puni&s;hed with the &s;ame Pe|nalties
of the Challenger. Furthermore, it is our
Plea&s;ure, That they who &s;hall Challenge for another,
or &s;hall accept a Challenge, without having informed
of it before, be Puni&s;hed with the &s;ame Penalties.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="58">
XI. And for &s;o much that be&s;ides the Puni&s;hment
that tho&s;e who Challenge ought to Incur, there are
&s;ome who de&s;erve to be doubly Cha&s;tized and Repre&s;|&s;ed,
as when they Attack tho&s;e who are their Benefa|ctors,
Superiors, and Lords, or Per&s;ons of Command,
and rai&s;ed by the Quality of their Charges, and e&s;peci|ally
when the Quarrels ari&s;e for Actions of Obedience,
to which an Inferiour Condition, Charge or Employ|ment,
hath &s;ubjected them, or for the Corrections
which they have undergone by their Authority, who
have the Power to impo&s;e them upon them: Con&s;ider|ing
that there is nothing more nece&s;&s;ary for the main|taining
of Di&s;cipline, e&s;pecially among&s;t tho&s;e who
make Profe&s;&s;ion of Arms, than Re&s;pect towards tho&s;e
who Command them: We Will and Command, That
they who &s;hall break out into that Exce&s;s, and more
particularly they who Challenge their Officers or O|thers,
who have the Right to Command them, &s;hall be
kept in Pri&s;on for the &s;pace of Four Years, deprived
of the Exerci&s;e of their Charges during the &s;aid Time,
with the Pay and Salary due to them, which &s;hall be
given to the Ho&s;pital-general of the next Town; and
in ca&s;e it be an Inferior again&s;t his Superior or Lord,
he &s;hall be kept in Pri&s;on during the &s;aid Four Years,
and &s;hall be condemned in a Fine which cannot be
le&s;s than a Year's Rent: Expre&s;ly charging our &s;aid
Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> Governours-General
of our Provinces, and the Lieutenant-Generals in the
&s;ame, and the Gentlemen deputed, and e&s;pecially the
Generals of our Armies, wherein that Di&s;order may
be more frequent than any where el&s;e, to &s;ee to the
&s;ever$ and exact Execution of the pre&s;ent Article. And
if the Superior Officers or Lords who have been Chal|lenged
receive the Challenge, and put them&s;elves in a
Condition of Satisfying the Challengers, they &s;hall be
Puni&s;hed with the &s;ame Penalties of Impri&s;onment,
Seque&s;tration of their Charges and Revenues of the
&s;ame, and Fines above &s;pecified, not to be di&s;pen&s;ed
therefrom, whatever In&s;tances and Supplications they
may make to us for that Effect.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="59">
XII. And fora&s;much as we are re&s;olv'd to Ca&s;hier
and Turn Out of Place all who &s;hall be found Guilty
of the &s;aid Crime, and that Notoriou&s;ly, if they who
have been &s;o Ca&s;hiered and Turned Out of Place re|&s;ent
it again&s;t tho&s;e whom we &s;hall Prefer to the &s;ame,
by Challenging, or Provoking them to Fight, either
by them&s;elves or others, in Re-encounter, or other|wi&s;e,
We Will that they, and tho&s;e whom they
have made u&s;e of, be Impri&s;oned for the &s;pace of Six
Years, and Condemned in a Fine of Six Years Rent of
their E&s;tates, without any Hopes of ever being Relea|&s;ed
from the &s;aid Penalties: And generally that they
who &s;hall a Second Time violate our pre&s;ent Edict, as
Challengers, and more particularly they who have
made u&s;e of Seconds to carry their Challenges, be
Puni&s;hed with the &s;ame Pains of Impri&s;onment, Lo&s;s
of Places, and Fines, though no Combat en&s;ued upon
it.</P>
<P>XIII. If contrary to the Prohibitions of this our
pre&s;ent Edict the Challenger and Challenged do actu|ally
Fight, We Will and Ordain, That though there
be none either Wounded or Killed, yet they &s;hall be
proceeded again&s;t Criminally and Extraordinarily;
that they be without Pardon Puni&s;hed with Death,
that all their Goods, Real and Per&s;onal, be confi&s;ca|ted
to us, a Third of them applicable to the Ho&s;pital
of the Town where the parliament is, in the Juri&s;di|ction
whereof the Crime hath been committed, and
jointly to the Ho&s;pital of the Royal Seat next to the
Place of the Fact; and the Two other Thirds, as well
for the Charges of the Apprehen&s;ion and Execution
of Ju&s;tice, as to what the Judges &s;hall think equitable
to adjudge to the Wives and Children, if any there
be, for their Sub&s;i&s;tence and Entertainment only du|ring
their Lives. And if the Crime be committed in
the Provinces where Confi&s;cation has no Place, it is
our Will and Plea&s;ure, That in&s;tead of the &s;aid Con|fi&s;cation,
a Fine be &s;et upon the Goods of the Crimi|nals,
to the Profit of the &s;aid Ho&s;pitals, which is not
to be le&s;s than the half of the Goods of the Criminals.
We Command and Charge our Proctors - General,
their Sub&s;titutes, and tho&s;e who have the Admini&s;tra|tion
<PB N="45" REF="60">
of the &s;aid Ho&s;pitals, to make careful Search and
Pro&s;ecutions for the &s;aid Sums and Confi&s;cations, for
the which their Action &s;hall continue during the time
and &s;pace of Twenty Years, though they &s;hould even
make no Pro&s;ecution that might Prorogue it, the
which Sums and Confi&s;cations &s;hall not be Remitted
nor Diverted upon any Cau&s;e or Pretext what&s;oever.
And if one or both the Duellers be Killed, We Will
and Command that the Criminal Proce&s;s be made a|gain&s;t
the Memory of the Dead, as again&s;t tho&s;e who
are Guilty of Trea&s;on again&s;t God and Man; and that
their Bodies be deprived of Burial; Prohibiting all
Curates, their Vicars, and other Church-men, to Interr
them, nor &s;uffer them to be Interred in Con&s;ecrated
Ground: Confi&s;cating be&s;ides, as above, all their
Goods, Real and Per&s;onal. And as to the Surviver
who hath Killed, be&s;ides the abovementioned Confi&s;|cation
of all his Goods, or the Fine amounting to one
half of the &s;ame in the Countries where Confi&s;cation
hath no Place, he &s;hall unpardonably be Puni&s;hed with
Death, according to the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Ordi|nances.</P>
<P>XIV.
The Goods of him that hath been Killed, and
of the Surviver, &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed of by the Admini|&s;trators
of the Ho&s;pitals during the Pro&s;ecution of the
Action for Duelling, and the Revenues applied to the
defraying the Co&s;ts of Suit.</P>
<P>XV. Though we hope that our Prohibitions, and
the Penalties &s;o ju&s;tly appointed again&s;t Duels, will
keep all our Subjects for the future from falling into
them, neverthele&s;s if any &s;hould &s;till be &s;o ra&s;h as to
dare to contravene our Will and Plea&s;ure, not only
in doing them&s;elves Ju&s;tice, but be&s;ides in engaging
al&s;o in their Quarrels and Re&s;entments, Seconds,
Thirds, or a greater Number of Per&s;ons, which can|not
be done by a crafty Cowardice, which makes
tho&s;e who are &s;en&s;ible of their own Weakne&s;s &s;eek
for the Safety they need in the Skill and Courage of
others: We Will, that they who &s;hall be found
guilty of &s;o Criminal and Ca&s;e a Contravention of
our pre&s;ent Edict, be without Remi&s;$ion puni&s;hed
with Death, though no Man &s;hould be Wounded or
<PB N="46" REF="61">
Hurt in the Duels; that all their Goods be Confi&s;cated
as before, that they be degraded, from Nobility, and
declared Ignoble, uncapable for ever of holding any
Place; their Arms defaced and publickly borne by the
Executioner of High Ju&s;tice. We enjoin their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors
to change their Arms, and take a New Coat,
for which they &s;hall obtain our Letters for that Effect;
and in ca&s;e they re&s;ume the &s;ame Arms, they &s;hall of
new be defaced, and borne by the Publick Executioner,
and they condemned in the Fine of Two Years Rent
of their E&s;tates, one half applicable to the Ho&s;pital-General
of the next Town, and the other half at the
Plea&s;ure of the Judges. And &s;eeing no Cha&s;ti&s;ement
can be great enough to puni&s;h tho&s;e who engage up|on
&s;o &s;light an Account, and &s;o criminally in the Re|&s;entment
of an Affront wherein they have no Con|cern,
and which they ought rather endeavour to ad|ju&s;t
for the Pre&s;ervation and Satisfaction of their
Friends, than to pur&s;ue the Revenge of it by Ways
that are as far from true Valour and Courage, as they
are from Charity and Chri&s;tian Friend&s;hip, it is our
Will, That all who fall into the Crime of being Se|conds,
Thirds, or other Numbers, be alike puni&s;hed
with the &s;ame Penalties which we have appointed
for tho&s;e that &s;hall Employ them.</P>
<P>XVI. Fora&s;much as there are &s;ome of Ba&s;e Birth,
and who have never carried Arms, who are neverthe|le&s;s
&s;o In&s;olent as to Challenge Gentlemen, who be|cau&s;e
of the Difference of their Conditions refu&s;ing to
do them Rea&s;on, the &s;ame Per&s;ons &s;tir up other Gen|tlemen
again&s;t tho&s;e whom they have Challenged,
whence &s;ometimes Murders follow; &s;o much the
more Dete&s;table, as that they proceed from an abject
Cau&s;e: We Will and Command, that in Ca&s;e of &s;uch
Challenges and Combats, e&s;pecially if they be attend|ed
with any great Wound or Death, the &s;aid ignoble
Fellows who &s;hall be duly attaint and convicted of
having cau&s;ed and promoted &s;uch Di&s;orders, without
Remi&s;&s;ion be Hanged all their Goods, Moveable,
and Immoveable, Confi&s;cated, Two Thirds to the
Ho&s;pitals of the Places, or of the next adjacent, and
the other Third employed for the Charges of the
<PB N="47" REF="62">
Trial, for the Maintenance of the Widows and Chil|dren
of the Decea&s;ed, if any there be: With Power
be&s;ides to the Judges of the &s;aid Crimes to appoint
of the Goods Confi&s;cated, &s;uch Recompence as they
&s;hall think rea&s;onable to the Informer, and other Di&s;|coverers
of the &s;aid Ca&s;e, to the End that in &s;o puni&s;h|able
a Crime every one may be invited to the inform|ing
of it. And as to the Gentlemen who have &s;o
fought for Unworthy Cau&s;es, and again&s;t Ignoble
Per&s;ons, We Will that they &s;uffer the &s;ame Puni&s;h|ments
that we have appointed again&s;t Seconds, if they
can be Apprehended; if not, they &s;hall be proceeded
again&s;t upon Default and Contumacy according to
the Rigour of the Ordinances.</P>
<P>XVII. We Will that all who &s;hall knowingly carry
Challenges, or attend to the Places of Duels, or Ren|counters,
as Lackeys, or other Servants, &s;hall be
whipt and &s;tigmatized for the fir&s;t Fault; and if they
relap&s;e into the &s;ame Fault, &s;ent to the Galleys for
ever. And for tho&s;e who have been Spectators of a
Duel, if they have gone purpo&s;ely for that Effect,
We Will that they be for ever deprived of the Places,
Dignities, and Pen&s;ions, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s; and if
they have no Places, that a Fourth Part of their
Goods be Confi&s;cated, and applied to Ho&s;pitals; and
if the Fact be committed in any Province where Con|fi&s;cation
hath no Place, that they be condemned in a
Fine for the Profit of the &s;aid Ho&s;pitals, which is not
to be le&s;s Worth than the Fourth Part of the Goods
of the &s;aid Spectators, whom with Rea&s;on we repute
Accomplices of &s;o Dete&s;table a Crime, &s;eeing they
a&s;&s;i&s;t at it, and hinder not the &s;ame as much as they
can, to which by the Laws of God and Man they are
obliged.</P>
<P>XVIII. And fora&s;much as it hath frequently hap|pened
that for avoiding the Rigour of the Penalties by
&s;o many Edicts appointed for Duels, many have
&s;ought for Occa&s;ions of Rencountering: We Will and
Command, that they who pretend to have re|ceived
any Offence, and have not given Notice of it to
the &s;aid Judges of the Point of Honour, and who
&s;hall engage upon Rencounter, or Fight Singly, or in
<PB N="48" REF="63">
an equal State and Number, with alike Arms on each
Side, on Foot, or on Hor&s;eback, be &s;ubject to the
&s;ame Puni&s;hments as if it had been a Duel. And be|cau&s;e
there have been al&s;o &s;ome of our Subjects, who
having qua$relled within our Dominions, and having
met to Fight without them, or upon our Frontiers,
have thought that by that Means they might evade
the Effect of our Edicts: We Will that all who
&s;hall do &s;o be pur&s;ued criminally, if they can be taken;
if not, upon Contumacies; and that they be Con|demned
to the &s;ame Puni&s;hment, and their Goods
Confi&s;cated, as if they had contravened the pre&s;ent
Edict within the Bounds, and not withdrawing out
of our Provinces, judging them &s;o much the more
Criminal and Puni&s;hable; that the fir&s;t Emotions in
the Heat and Newne&s;s of the Offence can no more
excu&s;e them; and that they have had Time enough
to moderate their Re&s;entment, and ab&s;tain from &s;o
prohibited a Revenge, no Place being left for tho&s;e
concerned in the Ca&s;es mentioned in this pre&s;ent Arti|cle
to alledge Chance or Accident, to which we charge
our Judges to have no Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>XIX. And to prevent that &s;o Holy a Law, and &s;o
Profitable to our State, become not u&s;ele&s;s to the Pub|lick,
for Fault of Ob&s;ervation thereof, We mo&s;t ex|pre&s;ly
Enjoin and Command our Cou&s;ins, the Mar|&s;hals
of <HI>France,</HI> to whom, under Our Authority, be|longs
the Cognizance and Deci&s;ion of Conte&s;ts and
Quarrels that concern the Honour and Reputation of
our Subjects, diligently and exactly to &s;ee to the Ex|ecution
of our Pre&s;ent Edict, without Remitting any
thing in it, or Permitting that by Favour, Conni|vance,
or any other Way, it be in any manner Contra|vened.
And that our &s;aid Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of
<HI>France,</HI> may have the more Means and Power to hinder
and repre&s;s that Unbridled Licen$iou&s;ne&s;s of Duels
and Rencounters; con&s;idering be&s;ides, that Diligence
is of great Importance for the Puni&s;hment of &s;uch
Crimes; and that the Provo&s;ts of Our &s;aid Cou&s;ins, the
Mar&s;hals, the Under-Bailiffs, Under-Stewards, and
Lieutenants-Criminal of the Short Robe, are mo&s;t
commonly on Hor&s;eback for our Service, that they
<PB N="49" REF="64">
may be the readier and more proper for Proceeding
against the Guilty of Duels and Rencounters, We have
of new A&s;&s;igned the Execution of the Pre&s;ent Edict,
as well within as without the Precincts of Towns, to
the Officers of the Con&s;tabulary and Mar&s;hal&s;ea of
<HI>France,</HI> Provo&s;ts-General of the &s;aid Con&s;tabulary of
the I&s;le of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Mints,</HI> and all other Pro|vo&s;ts-General,

them in ca&s;e of Refu&s;al and Di&s;obedience; and finally,
in Executing punctually, and all Affairs laid a&s;ide,
what &s;hall be Enjoined and Commanded them by our

Point of Honour, they be by our &s;aid Cou&s;ins Puni&s;h|ed

from their Places, and Deprivation of their Salaries,
which may be really Attached and Seized, upon the
bare Order of Our &s;aid Cou&s;ins, the Mar$hals of <HI>France,</HI>
or of one of them, &s;ignified to the Trea&s;urer in Ordi|nary
of our Wars who, &s;hall be in Duty Per&s;onally, or
at his Dwelling-Hou&s;e. Furthermore, We Command
the &s;aid Provo&s;ts, Under-Bailiffs, Under-Stewards,
their Lieutenants and Officers, in their &s;everal Juri&s;|dictions,
<PB N="50" REF="65">
upon the &s;ame Penalties of Su&s;pen&s;ion and
Deprivation of Salary, that upon the Report of a
Combat fought they forthwith go to the Pl$ces to
Arre&s;t the Guilty, and make them Pri&s;oners in the
Royal Pri&s;ons next to the Place where the Fact is
Committed, Ordaining, That for every Sei&s;ure they
be paid the Sum of 1500 Livres, to be rai&s;ed with the
other Charges of Suit upon the readie&s;t Goods of the
Guilty, and preferrably to the Confi&s;cations and Fines
which we have before impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>XXII. And &s;eeing the Guilty, to avoid falling into
the Hands of Ju&s;tice, commonly fly to the Hou&s;es of
the Great Men of Our Kingdom, We mo&s;t expre&s;ly
and &s;trictly Forbid all Per&s;ons, of what Quality and
Condition &s;oever they be, to receive within their
Hou&s;es any who have contravened this our Pre&s;ent
Edict. And in ca&s;e any be found who give them
Sanctuary, and refu&s;e to deliver them up unto the Hands
of Ju&s;tice, &s;o &s;oon as they &s;hall be required to it, We Will
that the Informations thereof, duly taken and drawn
up by the &s;aid Provo&s;ts, of the Mar&s;hals and other
Judges, be forthwith and in&s;tantly &s;ent to the Secreta|ries
of State, according to their &s;everal Offices, as al&s;o
the Attorneys-General of our Courts of Parliament,
and to our &s;aid Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals, to the end that
having con&s;ulted with them, we may command a ri|gorous
Pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e who protect &s;o Criminal
Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>XXIII. But if notwith&s;tanding the Care and Dili|gence
pre&s;cribed by the preceeding Articles, the Credit
and Authority of the Parties intere&s;&s;ed in the&s;e Crimes
divert the Proofs of them by Threats or Artifice, We
Will that upon the bare Requi&s;ition made by our
Attorneys$General, or their Sub&s;titutes, Monitories be
Decreed by the Officials of the Bi&s;hops of the Places,
which &s;hall be Publi&s;hed and Thundered according to
Canonical Form again&s;t tho&s;e who refu&s;e to come and
declare what they know concerning Duels and Ren|counters
that have happened. We further Command,
that for the future our Attorneys-General in our
Courts of Parliament, and their Sub&s;titutes, upon
Notice given them of Combats that have been fought,
<PB N="51" REF="66">
&s;hall make their Requi&s;itions again&s;t tho&s;e, who by No|toriety
&s;hall be judged guilty of them, and that accord|ing
thereunto our &s;aid Courts, without other Proofs,
order, That within the Time that they &s;hall think fit,
they be obliged to render them&s;elves Pri&s;oners for Ju|&s;tifying
them&s;elves, and An&s;wering upon the Requi|&s;itions
of Our &s;aid Attorneys-General: And if within
the &s;aid Time they fail to Obey the Orders that are
intimated to them at their Dwelling-hou&s;es, We will
have them proceeded again&s;t upon Default and Con|tumacy,
be Declared and Convicted of the Crimes ob|jected
to them; and as &s;uch, that they be Condemned
in the Penalties mentioned by Our Edicts, and their
Goods Acquired Confi&s;cated to Us, and put into
Our Hands, without waiting until the Five Years of
Defaults and Con$umacies be Expired, that all their
Hou&s;es be Ra&s;ed, and their Woods of high Growth
cut off to a certain Height, according to the Orders
we &s;hall give, and them&s;elves, declared Infamous, and
Degraded from Nobility, being for the future incapa|ble
of any Place or Office. We forbid all Our Courts
of Parliament, and Our other Judges, to admit them
to their Ju&s;tification after the Sentences of Condemna|tion,
ever during the Five Years of Contumacy, till
fir&s;t they have Obtained Our Letters, allowing them
Permi&s;&s;ion to appear, and have pay'd the Fines in
which they have been Condemned, and that notwith|&s;tanding
the Eighteenth Article of the Seventh Title of
Our Criminal Ordinance, which We have di&s;pen&s;ed
and do di&s;pen&s;e with in that re&s;pect, without being
drawn into Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>XXIV. And even when the Su&s;pected have been Ar|re&s;ted,
and put in Pri&s;on, or that they have delivered
them&s;elves into Pri&s;on, We Will, That in ca&s;e Our
Attorneys-General find it difficult to make out the
Proofs of the &s;aid Combats&punc; Our Courts give them
the Delays which they &s;hall require, referring it to the
Honour and Con&s;cience of Our &s;aid Attorneys-Gene|ral,
not to make u&s;e of them but for the Good of
Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>XXV. During the Time that the Parties Accu&s;ed
or Su&s;pected of the &s;aid Crimes do not render them|&s;elves
<PB N="52" REF="67">
Pri&s;oners&punc; We Will, That the Juri&s;diction of
their Lands be Executed in Our Name; and during
the &s;aid Time We will provide to the <HI>Offices</HI> and Be|nefices
of which the Di&s;po&s;ition belongs to the &s;aid
Parties Accu&s;ed or Su&s;pected.</P>
<P>XXVI. And to prevent that during the Time of the
Trials upon Defaults and Contumacies the Parties
Su&s;pected may not make u&s;e of the Means which they
u&s;ually practi&s;e for taking off the Proofs of their
Crimes, by Terrifying the Witne&s;&s;es, or Obliging
them to Retract when they come to Swear; it is Our
Will and Plea&s;ure, that not with&s;tanding the Third
Article of the Fifteenth Title of Our Ordinance of the
Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1650, with which we have di&s;|pen&s;ed,
and do di&s;pen&s;e, upon this Account of the
Crime of Duels only, the Officers of Our Courts, and
the Lieutenants-Criminal of Bailiwicks, where there is
a Pre&s;idial Seat, may proceed to the Examination of
Witne&s;&s;es within the Twenty and Four Hours, and as
&s;oon as may b$, after they have been heard in the In|formations,
and that before any Judgment that Or|dains
it hath pa&s;t, though the Examinations mu&s;t not
&s;tand in&s;tead of Confrontation till it hath been &s;o
ordained by the Judgment of Default and Contuma|cy.</P>
<P>XXVII.
We declare tho&s;e that are Condemned up|on
Contumacy incapable and unworthy of all Suc|ce&s;&s;ions
that may fall to them after their Condemna|tion,
though they be within the Five Years, and that
they were afterwards Re&s;tored notwith&s;tanding their
Contumacy. If the Succe&s;&s;ions fall before the Re&s;tau|ration,
the Lord&s;hip and Juri&s;diction of the Land$
&s;hall be Executed in our Name, and the Fruits a&s;&s;igned
to the Ho&s;pitals, without Hopes of Re&s;titution, to be
counted from the Day of the Condemnation upon
Contumacy.</P>
<P>XXVIII. We Will and Command in like manner,
That in the Places remote from Towns where our
Courts of Parliament Sit, that when after all the a|forementioned
Searches and Perqui&s;itions the Guilty
of Duels and Rencounters cannot be found, at the de|&s;ire
of the Sub&s;titutes of our Attorneys-General, upon
<PB N="53" REF="68">
the bare Notoriety of Fact Seizure be Decreed again&s;t
the Ab&s;ent, and for Fault of being able to apprehend
them by Virtue of that Decree, all their Goods be Seiz|ed,
and that they be cited to appear within Three
&s;hort Terms con&s;ecutively; and that thereupon the
Defaults &s;hall be put into the Hands of our Attorneys-General,
or their Sub&s;titutes, that the Profit of them
may be adjudged without other Form or Figure of
Proce&s;s within Eight Days after the Crime commit|ted,
and without any Obligation upon our &s;aid Attor|neys-General&punc;
or their Sub&s;titutes, to Inform and make
Proof of the Notoriety.</P>
<P>XXIX. When the Accu&s;ation is for the Crime of
Duelling, no Regulation of the Judges can be made,
notwith&s;tanding all Pretext of Prevention, A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion,
or otherwi&s;e, and the Proce&s;s cannot be pur|&s;ued,
but before the Judges of the Crime of Duel|ling.</P>
<P>XXX.
And to prevent the Surprizes of tho&s;e, who
to obtain Pardons may di&s;gui&s;e to us the Truth of
Combats that have happened, and alledge Fal&s;e Mat|ters
of Fact, to make it be believed that the &s;aid Com|bats
happened unexpectedly, and in Con&s;equence of a
Quarrel ari&s;ing on the Spot: We Ordain, That no
Man can carry through the Seals the Grant of any
Pardon in Ca&s;es where there is Su&s;picion of a Preme|ditated
Duel or Rencounter, unle&s;s he be actually a
Pri&s;oner in our Retinue, or at lea&s;t in the chief Pri&s;on
of the Parliament, in the Juri&s;diction whereof the
Combat hath been Fought: and unle&s;s it hath been
verified that he hath in no manner contravened this
our pre&s;ent Edict; &s;o that having thereupon taken the
Advice of our Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> We
may grant him a Remi&s;&s;ion with knowledge of the
Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>XXXI. And fora&s;much as in pur&s;uance of our Or|ders,
our Cou&s;ins, the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> are a&s;&s;em|bled
to Review and Examine of new the Regulation
made by them concerning the &s;everal Satisfactions and
Reparations of Honour, to which, by Orders from us,
they have added more &s;evere Puni&s;hments again&s;t the
Aggre&s;&s;ors; it is our Will and Plea&s;ure, That the
<PB N="54" REF="69">
&s;aid New Regulation, Dated the 22d of this pre&s;ent
Month, together with that of the 22d of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI>
1653, hereto annexed under the Counter-Seal of our
Chancellery, be inviolably followed and ob&s;erved for
the future by all tho&s;e that &s;hall be employed in ad|ju&s;ting
Differences which concern the Point of Honour
and Reputation of Gentlemen.</P>
<P>XXXII. And in re&s;pect that &s;ometimes the Admi|ni&s;trators
of Ho&s;pitals have neglected to recover the
&s;aid Fines and Confi&s;cations, We Will, That the Re|covery
of Fines and Confi&s;cations, adjudged to the &s;aid
Ho&s;pitals, and other Per&s;ons, who have been Negligent
for the &s;pace of a Year, to be counted from the Day
of the Sentences of Condemnation, be made by the
Receiver-General of our Revenues, to whom the half
of the &s;aid Confi&s;cations and Fines &s;hall belong, for
the Charges of the Recovery, re&s;erving to our&s;elf to
di&s;po&s;e of the other half in Favours of what Ho&s;pi|tals
we plea&s;e, be&s;ides that to which they have been
adjudged.</P>
<P>XXXIII. It is moreover our Will and Plea&s;ure,
That when Gentlemen have not obeyed the Orders of
the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> and that they have incurred the
Fines and Confi&s;cations appointed by this pre&s;ent E|dict,
and the Regulation of the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI>
Advice of it &s;hall forthwith be given by the &s;aid Mar|&s;hals
of <HI>France</HI> to our Attorneys-General in our Courts
of Parliament, or to their Sub&s;titutes, whom we en|join
immediately to proceed to the Seizure of Goods,
until the &s;aid Gentlemen do Obey; and in ca&s;e they
Obey not within Three Months, the Fruits &s;hall be
purely applied to Ho&s;pitals, until they have Obeyed.
the Charges of Provo&s;ts, of Procedure, Guards and
others, being fir&s;t Defalcated; and for that Effect
We Will, That the Directors and Admini&s;trators of the
&s;aid Ho&s;pitals be put in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and actual Enjoy|ment
of the &s;aid Goods. We Enjoin our &s;aid At|torneys-General,
and their Sub&s;titutes, to join with
the &s;aid Directors and Admini&s;trators for the &s;peedy
and real uplifting of the &s;aid Fines. We e&s;pecially
Charge the Judges to have no Re&s;pect to Contracts&punc;
<PB N="55" REF="70">
Wills and Te&s;taments, nor other Acts made within
Six Months before the Crimes committed.</P>
<P>XXXIV. When any one &s;hall happen to be Killed in
Combats, We permit the Relations of the Decea&s;ed to
become Party within Three Months for longe&s;t delay
again&s;t him who hath Killed; and in ca&s;e he be Con|victed
of the Crime, Condemned and Executed, We
make over the Confi&s;cation of the Decea&s;ed to the
Profit of him that hath pur&s;ued, who &s;hall not be ob|liged
to obtain another Grant of the Gift be&s;ides this
pre&s;ent Edict. As to the Relations to who&s;e Profit
We have made over the Confi&s;cation, We Will that
the neare&s;t of Kin be Preferred before the more Re|mote,
Provided they have made them&s;elves Parties
within the Three Months, upon Condition of Reim|bur&s;ing
the Charges that have been laid out.</P>
<P>XXXV. The Crime of Duelling cannot be extin|gui&s;hed
neither by Death, nor by any Pre&s;cription of
Twenty or Thirty Years, nor by any other, unle&s;s Exe|cution,
Condemnation, or Complaint, have been made;
and it may be Pro&s;ecuted after any Lap&s;e of Time
what&s;oever again&s;t the Party, or again&s;t his Memory&punc;
Nay, tho&s;e who &s;hall be found Guilty of Duelling
&s;ince our Edict of 1651, Regi&s;tred in our Court of Par|liament
of <HI>Paris,</HI> in the Month of <HI>September</HI> the &s;ame
Year, may be called to an Account for the other Crimes
committed by them before or &s;ince, notwith&s;tanding
the &s;aid Pre&s;cription of Twenty and Thirty Years, pro|vided
they be at the &s;ame Time tried for the Crime of
Duelling, and by the &s;ame Judges, and that they be
Convicted of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>XXXVI. All the Penalties contained in the pre&s;ent
Edict for Puni&s;hment of the Contraveners of our
Will and Plea&s;ure would be U&s;ele&s;s, and of no Effect,
if by the Motives of an inflexible Ju&s;tice and Steadfa&s;t|ne&s;s
we maintained not the Laws which we have E|&s;tabli&s;hed.
For that End We Swear and Promi&s;e in
the Faith and Word of a King, not to exempt for the
future any $er&s;on, for any Cau&s;e or Con&s;ideration
what&s;oever, from the Rigour of the pre&s;ent Edict, that
no Remi&s;&s;ion, Pardon and Obolition &s;hall be granted
<PB N="56" REF="71">
by us to tho&s;e who &s;hall be guilty of the &s;aid Crimes
of Duels and Rencounters. We mo&s;t &s;trictly Charge
all Princes and Lords about us not to make any Inter|ce&s;&s;ions
for tho&s;e that are guilty of the &s;aid Crimes,
upon Pain of Incurring our Indignation. Prote&s;ting
again, That neither in Favours of any Marriage of a
Prince or Prince&s;s of our Blood, nor for the Birth of
Princes or Children of <HI>France,</HI> which may happen du|ring
our Reign, nor for any Con&s;ideration General and
Particular that may be, we will not knowingly &s;uffer
any Grants to be expeded contrary to our pre&s;ent Will,
the Execution whereof we have Expre&s;ly and Solemn|ly
Sworn upon the Day of our Coronation, to the
End &s;o Chri&s;tian, Ju&s;t and Nece&s;&s;ary, a Law may be
rendred more Authentick and Inviolable. We Charge
and Command our Tru&s;ty and Beloved Councellors,
tho&s;e that hold our Court of Parliament, that they
cau&s;e the&s;e Pre&s;ents to be Read, Publi&s;hed and Regi|&s;tred,
and the Contents thereof Inviolably Kept and
Ob&s;erved, without Contravening, or permitting them
to be Contravened; for &s;uch is our Plea&s;ure. And
that it may be a Thing for ever Firm and Stable, We
have cau&s;ed our Seal to be put to the&s;e Pre&s;ents. Given

That we &s;hould in&s;tantly Meet to frame a Regulation, the
mo&s;t Exact and Di&s;tinct that may be, concerning the vari|ous
Satisfactions and Reparations of Honour, which we
&s;hall judge ought to be appointed according to the Diffe|rent
Degrees of Offences: And in &s;uch a Manner that
the Puni&s;hment of the Aggre&s;&s;or, and the Satisfaction of
the Party Offended, be &s;o great and &s;o proportionable to
the Injury Received, That no new Complaint nor Quarrel

followed and ob&s;erved for the Future by all
tho&s;e who &s;hall be employed in adju&s;ting of Differences
concerning the Point of Honour and Reputation of Gentle|men.
<HI>We having &s;een and examined the Propo&s;itions
of &s;everal Gentlemen of Quality of this Kingdom,
who have had divers Conferences together upon this
Subject, in pur&s;uance of the Orders they had from us
of the fir&s;t of</HI> July 1651. <HI>and who have pre&s;ented in
our A&s;&s;embly the &s;aid Propo&s;itions, drawn up in Wri|ting,
and &s;igned with their Hands, after mature Deli|beration
We have Concluded and Agreed upon the
following Articles.</HI></P>
<P>I. In the Fir&s;t Place, That in all Occa&s;ions and Sub|jects
that may cau&s;e Quarrels and Re&s;entments, no
Gentleman ought to think it Incon&s;i&s;tent with Honour
to do any thing that may give a clear and &s;incere Ex|planation
of the Truth.</P>
<P>II. That among&s;t Gentlemen, many having alrea|dy
&s;olemnly Prote&s;ted, and in Writing, that they will
refu&s;e all Challenges, and never Fight a Duel for any
Cau&s;e what&s;oever: The&s;e are &s;o much the more obli|ged
to give a clear Under&s;tanding, that without it
they would formally Contravene their own Wri|ting,
<PB N="58" REF="73">
and by con&s;equent, the more de&s;erve Reproof and
Cha&s;ti&s;ement in the adju&s;ting of Quarrels that may
ari&s;e for want of a clear Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><HI>But if he that pretends him&s;elf to be offended has
&s;o little Rea&s;on as not to be &s;atisfied with the Ex|planation
that hath been fairly and &s;incerely given
him, and that he will oblige him by whom he thinks
him&s;elf affronted, to Fight him: He who hath re|nounced
Duelling may An&s;wer him to this, or the
like Purpo&s;e:</HI> That he wonders very much, that know|ing
the la&s;t Edicts of the King, and particularly the De|claration
of &s;everal Gentlemen, wherein he hath publickly
engaged him&s;elf not to Fight, he will not re&s;t &s;atisfied
with the clear &V;nder&s;tanding that he gives him: And
that he con&s;iders not, that he neither can, nor ought to give
or receive any Place for Fighting, nay, nor to tell him
where be may Rencounter him, but that he will change no|thing
in his ordinary Cour&s;e of Life. <HI>And generally all
other Gentlemen may An&s;wer,</HI> That if they be &s;et up|on
they will defend them&s;elves, but that they think not
them&s;elves obliged in Honour to Fight in Cold Blood, and
&s;o formally to contravene his Maje&s;ty's Edicts, the Laws
of Religion, and their own Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>IV. When there happens any Quarrel among&s;t Gen|tlemen,
of whom &s;ome have promi&s;ed under Hand|writing
not to Fight, and the others not, The&s;e
latter &s;hall always be reputed Aggre&s;&s;ors, if the con|trary
appear not by evident Proof.</P>
<P>V. And becau&s;e the Ways of Fact might ea&s;ily be
prevented, if we, the Governours, or Lieutenant-Generals
of Provinces were carefully informed of all
the Cau&s;es and Beginnings of Quarrels, We have con|&s;ulted
and agreed, conform to the Power given us by
his Maje&s;ty's la$$ Edict, regi&s;tred in Parliament, the
King &s;itting there, the 7th of <HI>September,</HI> 1651, forth|with
to name and depute in every Bailiwick and
Stewardy of this Kingdom, one or more Gentlemen
of Quality, Age, and requi&s;ite Sufficiency for receiv|ing
the Intelligences of the Differences of Gentlemen,
and for &s;endi$g them to us, or to the Governours and
Lieutenant-Generals of Provinces, when they are re|&s;ident
<PB N="59" REF="74">
there; and for doing all Things in General
that are pre&s;cribed by the Second Article of the &s;aid
Edict.</P>
<P>And in Conformity to the &s;ame Edict, we charge
all our Provo&s;ts, Under-Bailiffs, Under-Stewards,
Lieutenants-Criminal of the Short Robe, and other
Officers of Mar&s;hal&s;eas, readily and faithfully to obey
the &s;aid Gentlemen deputed, for the Execution of
their Orders.</P>
<P>VI. And to the End we may be the more carefully
informed of the Differences of Gentlemen, we declare,
according to the Third Article of the &s;ame Edict,
That all, who &s;hall meet, though accidentally, in the
Places where Offences are given, either by Reports,
Injurious Di&s;cour&s;es, or Words, or by giving the Lie,
Threats, Blows, Cudgellings, or other Outrages a|gain&s;t
Honour, of what Nature &s;oever they be, &s;hall
for the future be obliged to give us Notice of the
&s;ame, or the Governours, or Lieutenant-Generals of
Provinces, or the Gentlemen deputed, upon Pain of
being reputed Accomplices of the &s;aid Offences, and
of being pro&s;ecuted as having tacitly contributed
thereunto; and that they who have Knowledge of
Law-Suits ready to be commenced among&s;t Gentlemen
for &s;ome Important Concern, &s;hall be al&s;o obliged,
according to the &s;ame Third Article of the &s;aid Edict,
to give us Notice of the &s;ame, or the Governours&punc;
and the Lieutenants-General of Provinces, or the
Gentlemen deputed in the Bailiwicks, to the End
Means may be provided to hinder the Parties from
leaving the ordinary Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice, and coming to
the Ways of Fact for doing them&s;elves Right.</P>
<P>VII. And becau&s;e that in all Offences that one may
receive, it is Nece&s;&s;ary to E&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome General
Rules for the Satisfactions, which may &s;ufficiently
repair the Honour, when once they are received and
practi&s;ed; &s;eeing it is but too true, that Opinion alone
hath e&s;tabli&s;hed mo&s;t Part of the Maxims of the Point
of Honour; and con&s;idering, that in Offences, it is
above all Things to be minded, if they have been
given without Cau&s;e, and if they have not been an|&s;wered
<PB N="60" REF="75">
with &s;ome Repartees or more heinous Re|venges:
We declare that in tho&s;e which have been &s;o
given without Cau&s;e, and have not been an&s;wered,
if they con&s;i&s;t in Reproachful Words, as of <HI>Sot, Coward,
Traitor,</HI> or the like, it may be ordered for a Puni&s;h|ment,
that the Offender lie a Month in Pri&s;on, and
the Time not to be le&s;&s;ened by the Credit or Inter|ce&s;&s;ion
of any Per&s;on what&s;oever, no not by the In|dulgence
of the Party Offended; and that after he
comes out of Pri&s;on, he &s;hall declare to the Per&s;on
Offended, <HI>That impertinently, and out of purpo&s;e, he hath
offended him by outrageous Words, which he acknowledges
to be fal&s;e, and begs his Pardon for them.</HI></P>
<P>VIII. For the Lye, or Blows with the Hand or
Cane, Two Months Impri&s;onment &s;hall be appointed,
which, as before, cannot be Shortened; and after that
the Offender is come out of Pri&s;on, he &s;hall ask the
Party Offended Pardon, with Words more Satisfacto|ry
than the former, and which &s;hall be particularly
&s;pecified by the Judges of the Point of Honour.</P>
<P>IX. For actual Offences by Cuffs, or the like, it &s;hall
be appointed for Puni&s;hment, That the Offender lie
in Pri&s;on for Six Months, which Time, as before, is
not to be dimini&s;hed, unle&s;s the Offender de&s;ire that
the half of that Impri&s;onment alone be commuted in|to
a Fine, which cannot be le&s;s than 1500 Livres, ap|plicable
to the next Ho&s;pital to the Place where the
Party Offended lives, and which &s;hall be paid before
the Offender come out of Pri&s;on; nay, and after he
comes out, he &s;hall &s;ubmit him&s;elf over and above to
receive, from the Hand of the Party Offended, Blows
of the &s;ame Nature of tho&s;e which he hath given, and
&s;hall declare by Word and Writing, <HI>That he hath bruti&s;h|ly
&s;trucken him, and pray him to pardon and forget that
Offen$$.</HI></P>
<P>X. For Canings, or other Outrages of the like Na|ture,
the Offender &s;hall lie in Pri&s;on for a whole Year
and that Time cannot be Moderated, unle&s;s for Six
Months, upon Payment of 3000 Livres as a Fine, pay|able
and applicable in the manner above-mentioned;
and after he is come out of Pri&s;on, he &s;hall on hi$
<PB N="61" REF="76">
Knees beg Pardon of the Party Offended, in that Po|&s;ture
&s;ubmit him&s;elf to receive the like Blows, hum|bly
thank him, if he give him them not, as he might,
and be&s;ides declare by Words and Writing, <HI>That he
bruti&s;hly offended him, be&s;eech him to forget it, and that
if he were in his place, he would be content with the &s;ame
Satisfaction.</HI> And in all Offences of Blows with the
Hand, Cane, or &s;uch like, be&s;ides the afore&s;aid Pu|ni&s;hment
and Satisfactions, the Party Offended may
be obliged to Cha&s;ti&s;e the Offender with the &s;ame
Blows that he hath received, though he &s;hould even
be &s;o Generous as not to give them, and that only in
ca&s;e that the Offence be by the Circum&s;tances judged
&s;o Atrocious, that it requires the Party Offended to be
reduced to that Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>XI. And when Accommodations are made in all
the afore&s;aid Ca&s;es, the Judges of the Point of Honour
may appoint what Number of the Friends of the Par|ty
Offended they plea&s;e, to &s;ee the Satisfactions En|joined,
Performed, and Rendred more Publick.</P>
<P>XII. For Offences and Outrages done to the Honour
of a Gentleman, upon Occa&s;ion of &s;ome Civil Intere&s;t,
or of &s;ome Law-Suit already Commenced before the
Ordinary Judges, in the&s;e the Satisfactions cannot be
too rigorous. And they who adju&s;t &s;uch Differences,
may, be&s;ides the Puni&s;hments above &s;pecified in every
kind of Offence, order al&s;o Bani&s;hment, for as long a
Time as they &s;hall judge convenient, from the Places
where the Offender has his ordinary Re&s;idence. And
when, by Notoriety of Fact, or other Proofs, it be
made appear, That a Gentleman hath taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of any thing by the Ways of Fact or by Surprize, no
Accommodation can be made, no not concerning the
Point of Honour, till fir&s;t the Thing di&s;puted be put
into the &s;ame Condition it was before the Violence, or
Surprize.</P>
<P>XIII. And becau&s;e be&s;ides the afore-mentioned
Cau&s;es of Differences, Words that may be pretended
to have been given and broken, produce a great many
others: We declare, That a Gentleman that hath got
a Promi&s;e of another, concerning any Bu&s;ine&s;s what|&s;oever,
<PB N="62" REF="77">
can build nothing upon it for the future, nor
complain of the Breach of it, unle&s;s it hath been given
him in Writing, or in Pre&s;ence of one or more Gen|tlemen.
So that all Gentlemen &s;hall hereafter be ob|liged
to u&s;e that Caution, not only for Obeying Our
Regulations, but al&s;o for the Intere&s;t that every one
hath of Pre&s;erving the Friend&s;hip of him that hath
pa&s;t his Word to him, and of not being declared an
Aggre&s;&s;or, as he &s;hall be for the Time to come in all
Quarrels that &s;hall ari&s;e from a Promi&s;e given without
Writing or Witne&s;&s;es, and which he &s;hall pretend not
to have been kept.</P>
<P>XIV. If a Promi&s;e made in Writing, or before other
Gentlemen, be violated, the Party concerned &s;hall be
obliged to demand Ju&s;tice from Us, from the Gover|nours,
or Lieutenant-Generals of Provinces, or from
the Gentlemen deputed, for Fault whereof he &s;hall be
reputed Aggre&s;&s;or in all the Quarrels that may happen
upon Breach of that Promi&s;e: As al&s;o all the Wit|ne&s;&s;es
of the &s;aid Breach of Promi&s;e who have not
given Notice of it, &s;hall be re&s;pon&s;ible for all the Di&s;|orders
that may follow thereupon. And as to what
concerns the &s;aid Breaches of Promi&s;e, Reparations and
Satisfactions &s;hall be appointed according to the Im|portance
of the Affair.</P>
<P>XV. If by the Relation of tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent,
or other Proofs, it appear, that an Injury hath been
done upon a Premeditated De&s;ign, out of Frolick, and
upon Advantage, We declare, That according to the
Laws of Honour, the Party Offended may Pro&s;ecute
the Aggre&s;&s;or and his Complices before the Ordinary
Judges, as if he had been A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated. And that Pro|ceeding
ought not to &s;eem &s;trange, &s;ince he that Of|fends
another upon Advantage, by that Action renders
him&s;elf unworthy of being u&s;ed as a Gentleman: If
neverthele&s;s the Per&s;on Offended had not rather refer
him&s;elf to Our Judgment, or to the Judgment of the
other Judges of the Point of Honour for Satisfaction,
and for the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of the Aggre&s;&s;or, which
ought to be far greater than all the preceding, which
<PB N="63" REF="78">
only concern Offences given in &s;udden and unexpected
Quarrels.</P>
<P>XVI. In ca&s;e a Gentleman refu&s;e, or without law|ful
Cau&s;e delay to Obey Our Orders, or the Orders of
the other Judges of the Point of Honour, as to ap|pear
before Us or them, when he hath been Summon|ed
to it, either Per&s;onally, or at his Dwelling Hou&s;e;
and al&s;o when he hath not Submitted to the Puni&s;h|ments
inflicted upon him; he &s;hall be, after a Time
pr$&s;cribed, forthwith Con&s;trained to it, by Quarter|ing
Soldiers in his Hou&s;e, or Impri&s;onment, conform
to the Eighth Article of the &s;aid Edict. Which &s;hall
be carefully put in Execution by Our Provo&s;ts, Under-Bailiffs,
Under-Stewards, Lieutenants-Criminal of the
Short Robe, and other Lieutenants, Exempts, and
Officers of the Mar&s;hal&s;eas, upon Pain of Su&s;pen&s;ion
from their Charges, and Lo&s;s of their Salaries; and
the &s;aid Execution &s;hall be done at the Co&s;t and
Charges of the Di&s;obedient and Refractory Per&s;on.</P>
<P>XVII. And according to the &s;ame Eighth Article of
the &s;aid Edict, if Our Provo&s;ts, Under-Bailiffs, Un|der-Stewards,
Lieutenants-Criminal of the Short
Robe, and other Officers of the Mar&s;hal&s;eas, cannot
put in Execution the &s;aid Impri&s;onments, they &s;hall
Seize and E&s;treat all the Revenues of the &s;aid Di&s;obe|dient,
give Advice of the &s;aid Sei&s;ures to the Attor|neys-General
or their Sub&s;$itutes, according to the la&s;t
Declaration again&s;t Duelling, regi&s;tred in the Parlia|ment
of <HI>Paris</HI> the 29th of <HI>July</HI> la&s;t; the &s;aid Revenues
to be applied, and remain acquired, during all the Time
of Di&s;obedience, to the Ho&s;pital of the Town where
the Parliament is; under the Juri&s;diction whereof the
Goods of the Di&s;obedient are jointly with the Ho&s;pi|tal
of the Royal Seat, on which they al&s;o depend; to
the end that mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ting one another in the Pro|&s;ecution,
the one may furni&s;h Information and Proof,
the other Ju&s;tice and Authority. And in ca&s;e there be
preceding Debts which hinder the U$lifting of the
Revenue confi&s;cated to the Protit of $word$ &s;aid Ho&s;pitals,
the Sum to which the &s;aid Revenu$ may amount &s;hall
become a real Debt upon all the Goods Moveable and
<PB N="64" REF="79">
Immoveable of the Di&s;obedient, to be Payed and Di&s;|charged
in Cour&s;e, according to the &s;ame Eighth Ar|ticle
of the &s;aid Edict.</P>
<P>XVIII. If they who have been by us, and the other
Judges of the Point of Honour, put under Guard, mak$
their E&s;cape, the Accommodation &s;hall not be made
till fir&s;t they have kept Pri&s;on during the Time that
&s;hall be appointed.</P>
<P>XIX. And generally in all the other Differences of
Offences, that have not been above Specified, and
which are of infinite Variety; as if they have been
given without Cau&s;e, and if they have been an&s;wered
with more heinous Repartees; or if by Outrageous
Words the Offender has drawn upon him&s;elf the Lye,
or a Cuff; and in a Word, in all other Rencounters of
Injuries in&s;en&s;ibly aggravated, We refer it to the Judges
of the Point of Honour, to appoint &s;uch Puni&s;hments
and Satisfactions as the Ca&s;es and Circum&s;tances &s;hall
require; Exhorting them to have always a Particular
Eye upon him that hath been the Aggre&s;&s;or, and the
fir&s;t Cau&s;e of the Offence, and to &s;end back be|fore
Us all tho&s;e who would repre&s;ent to us their
Rea&s;ons, conform to the Second Article of his Ma|je&s;ty's
la&s;t Edict, regi&s;tred, as hath been &s;aid, in Par|liament
the 7th of <HI>September,</HI> 1651.</P>

<HEAD>The new Regulation made by the Mar&s;hals of
France, which Confirms and Enlarges the

<P>THE King having commanded us to meet, and ex|amine
of new the Regulation which we made by
expre&s;s Orders of His Maje&s;ty, Dated the 22d of <HI>Au|gu&s;t,</HI>
165$, concerning the Satisfactions and Repara|tions
of Honour among&s;t Gentelemen, it being His Ma|je&s;ty's
Intention to augment the Puni&s;hments and Sa|tisfactions
in &s;uch Sort that they be equal and pro|portionable
to the Injuries. In Obedience to his Ma|je&s;ty's
Orders, under his good will and Plea&s;ure, We
have thought,</P>
<P>That the Fir&s;t, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth
Articles of the &s;aid Regulation ought to be put in Ex|ecution.</P>
<P>As
to the Sixth, it is our Opinion, That tho&s;e who
have been pre&s;ent at Offences, and have not inform|ed
of them, ought to be Puni&s;hed by Six Months Im|pri&s;onment.</P>
<P>As
to the Seventh Article, in&s;tead of One Months
Impri&s;onment for him that hath Offended, we are
of Opinion, That he lye Two Months in Pri&s;on, and
that the re&s;t of the Article be put in Execution.</P>
<P>As to the Eighth Article, it is our Opinion, That
the Offender ought to &s;uffer Four Months Impri&s;on|ment
in&s;tead of Two, and after he hath come out of
Pri&s;on ask Pardon of the Party Offended.</P>
<P>As to the Ninth Article, We think that for actual
Offences of Cu$$s or $lows with the Hand in the Heat
of Quarrels, if a Lie went before the Box or Blow,
he that hath $$rucken ought to be committed to a
Pri&s;on for a Year: and if no Lie went before, he ought
<PB N="66" REF="81">
to lye in Pri&s;on for the &s;pace of Two Years, and the
Time not to be &s;hortned for any Cau&s;e what&s;oever,
though the Party Offended &s;hould even demand it;
and that after the Offender is come out of Pri&s;on, he
&s;hall &s;till &s;ubmit to receive from the Hand of the Party
Offended the like Blows as he hath given, and &s;hall
declare by Word and Writing, That he hath &s;trucken
him Bruti&s;hly, and be&s;eech him to Pardon him, and
to forget that Offence.</P>
<P>As to the Tenth Article, in regard of Caneings, or
other the like Outrages given in the Heat of Quarrels,
in ca&s;e they have been given after a Box or Blow with
the Hand, he that hath &s;trucken with a Cudgel, or o|therwi&s;e,
&s;hall keep Pri&s;on for the &s;pace of Two Years;
and in ca&s;e he hath been beaten before, he &s;hall be
Pri&s;oner for Four Years; and when he hath come out
he &s;hall ask Pardon of the Party Offended.</P>
<P>As to the Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth and Four|teenth
Articles, it is our Opinion, That they ought
to be put in Execution, and nothing altered in them.</P>
<P>As to the Fifteenth Article, we judge, that if by
the Relation of Per&s;ons Pre&s;ent, Notoriety, or any o|ther
Proofs, it appear that an Injury by Blows of a
Cane, Cudgel, or any other of the like Nature, hath
been done by Premeditated De&s;ign, Surprize, or upon
Advantage, he that hath &s;trucken &s;ingly and before
one's Face, ought to keep Pri&s;on for the &s;pace of Fif|teen
Years; and that he who &s;triketh behind one's
Back, though alone, and upon Advantage, whether
by taking Company along with him, or otherwi&s;e,
ought to keep Pri&s;on during the &s;pace of Twenty Years
complete, and that in a Town, Cittadel, or Fortre&s;s,
di&s;tant at lea&s;t Thirty Leagues from the Place where
the Party Offended has his ordinary Re&s;idence: And
that Prohibition be $ade by his Maje&s;ty to the Offen|der
