<HEAD TYPE="sub">TOWN AND CANTON OF BERNE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Berne, <DATE>Sept. 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS very much &s;truck, upon my entrance into Berne,
with its &s;ingular neatne&s;s and beauty. The principal &s;treets
are broad and long, not &s;trait, but gently curved: the
hou&s;es are mo&s;tly uniform, built of a greyi&s;h &s;tone upon ar|cades.
Through the middle of the &s;treets runs a lively
&s;tream of the cleare&s;t water, in a &s;tone channel, while &s;everal
fountains are not le&s;s ornamental to the place than beneficial
to the inhabitants. The river Aar almo&s;t &s;urrounds the
town, winding its cour&s;e over a rocky bed much below the
level of the &s;treets; and for a con&s;iderable way forming by
its &s;teep and craggy banks a kind of natural rampart. The
cathedral, a noble piece of Gothic architecture, &s;tands upon
a platform rai&s;ed at a great expence above the bed of the
river, and commands a mo&s;t exten&s;ive view. The adjacent
country is richly cultivated, and agreeably diver&s;ified with
<PB N="2" REF="8">
hills, lawns, wood, and water; the river flows rapidly below,
and an abrupt chain of rugged and &s;now-capt alps bounds
the horizon. Such an a&s;&s;emblage of wild and beautiful objects
would in any place pre&s;ent a mo&s;t &s;triking pro&s;pect; but its
effect becomes greatly heightened when &s;een from the mid&s;t
of a large town.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the native hi&s;torians, Berne was built by
Berchtold the Fifth, duke of Zaeringen; and was, from its
foundation, an imperial city. Upon the death of Berchtold
in 1218, the emperor Frederic the Second conferred upon
the inhabitants con&s;iderable privileges, and compiled al&s;o a
code of legi&s;lation, which forms the ba&s;is of their pre&s;ent
civil laws. The liberty which this city enjoyed, attracted
many inhabitants from the adjacent country, who found a
&s;afe a&s;ylum from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the nobles. Although
Berne from its fir&s;t foundation was engaged in perpetual
wars with its neighbours, and for &s;ome time with the hou&s;e
of Au&s;tria; yet it continued to aggrandi&s;e it&s;elf by degrees,
and con&s;iderably to enlarge its territory. In the year 1353,
Berne acceded to the Helvetic confederacy; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
&s;uch great power, even at that early period, as to obtain
the &s;econd rank among the Swi&s;s cantons. Since the ac|qui&s;ition
of the Pays de Vaud, the domains of this can|ton
form nearly the third part of Switzerland, and about
the fourth of the actual population; it contains about
370, 000 &s;ouls, exclu&s;ive of 11, 000 in the capital. At the
introduction of the reformation in 1528, government ac|quired
a large increa&s;e of revenue by &s;ecularizing the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
<PB N="3" REF="9">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. At the &s;ame period, the whole canton
followed the example of the capital; and the reformed reli|gion
was permanently e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE canton is divided into two great divi&s;ions; the Pays
de Vaud, and the German di&s;trict. The Pays de Vaud having
been conquered from the hou&s;e of Savoy, and the German
di&s;trict from the &s;tates of the empire; ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered,
and the taxes regulated in tho&s;e two provinces by laws and
cu&s;toms peculiar to each. Each of the&s;e divi&s;ions has its
trea&s;urer and chamber of appeal re&s;ident in the capital: the
chamber of appeal belonging to the Pays de Vaud, judges in
the la&s;t re&s;ort; but the inhabitants of the German di&s;trict
may again appeal from theirs to the Sovereign Council.</P>
<P>AT Berne the &s;ociety is extremely agreeable, and foreign|ers
are received with great ea&s;e and politene&s;s. The men
do not meet in &s;eparate &s;ocieties; and the women are the
life and ornament of their daily a&s;&s;emblies. The&s;e a&s;&s;em|blies
begin about four or five in the afternoon, and con|tinue
till about eight, when the parties retire to their re|&s;pective
hou&s;es. Dancing is a very frequent amu&s;ement at
Berne. There is a public ball every fortnight; and in
winter &s;carcely an evening pa&s;&s;es without one. The&s;e diver|&s;ions
commence at &s;o early an hour as five in the after|noon,
on account of a &s;tanding order from government,
which prohibits their continuance after eleven. Engli&s;h
country dances are commonly introduced, but the <HI>wal&s;e</HI>
(which is a &s;pecies of allemande) the favourite dance of the
natives, is mo&s;t common. The parties arrange them&s;elves in
<PB N="4" REF="10">
di&s;tinct couples, and follow each other in a circular direction,
the gentleman turning his partner with great velocity. The
life and &s;pirit of their dances &s;trike a foreigner with a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
and can &s;carely be conceived by tho&s;e who have never
&s;een them. The gaiety of the&s;e parties is &s;till more enlivened
during the &s;ummer months, when the natives re&s;ort to a gar|den
near the town, and dance under an open pavillion amid
&s;cenes of rural fe&s;tivity. The foreigner who prefers the con|&s;tant
intercour&s;e of company to a more tranquil &s;ociety, will
chu&s;e the re&s;idence of Berne rather than that of any other
town in Switzerland.</P>
<P>THERE is but little trade in the capital: &s;ome few manu|factures
indeed (chiefly of linen and &s;ilk) have been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed;
but are carried on by tho&s;e only, who have no
pro&s;pect of being admitted into the Sovereign Council. For,
tho&s;e families who enjoy any influence in public affairs
would hold them&s;elves degraded, by engaging in any branch
of commerce; and as offices of the &s;tate, except bailliages,
are in general not very profitable, nor indeed numerous,
many enter, as their &s;ole re&s;ource, into foreign armies. One
general advantage, however, is derived from this anti-com|mercial
&s;pirit: the members of government not being in|tere&s;ted
in laying re&s;trictions on trade, do not, as at Zuric
and Ba&s;le, con&s;ine the exclu&s;ive right of e&s;tabli&s;hing manu|factures
to the burghers of the capital; but wi&s;ely extend
that permi&s;&s;ion to all their &s;ubjects, without di&s;tinction of rank
or place. From this circum&s;tance, in conjunction with the
mildne&s;s and wi&s;dom of government, ari&s;es that comfortable
&s;tate, and even wealth, which &s;o peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hes the
<PB N="5" REF="11">
pea&s;antry in the whole canton of Berne; and to the natural
re&s;ult of the&s;e wi&s;e regulations may be rea&s;onably imputed
the attachment to government particularly ob&s;ervable in the
German di&s;trict. It is worthy of remark, that the pea&s;ants,
who have acquired opulence either by manufactures or agri|culture,
&s;eldom quit their &s;ituation; they continue in the
&s;ame habits which they contracted in the earlier period of
life, and, however wealthy, never give their daughters in
marriage but to per&s;ons of their own de&s;cription.</P>
<P>THE public buildings are con&s;tructed in a noble &s;impli|city
of &s;tyle, and announce the riches and grandeur of the
republic. The ar&s;enal contains arms for &s;ixty thou&s;and
men, and a con&s;iderable quantity of cannon, which are ca&s;t
in the town. The granary, an excellent in&s;titution, &s;imilar
to that of Zuric, always contains a large provi&s;ion of corn,
&s;upplied in con&s;equence of particular treaties by France
and Holland.</P>
<P>THE charitable in&s;titutions of Berne are numerous, liberal,
and well directed. The ho&s;pitals are in general large, clean,
and airy; and in the alms-hou&s;e, for the reception of fifty
poor citizens, is a curious e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;imilar to one which
I noticed at Ba&s;le. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed travellers are treated with a
meal and a lodging, if at night, and receive &s;ix-pence on
their departure. If &s;ick or wounded, they are maintained
till their recovery is e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of correction, which, when the benevolent
Mr. Howard vi&s;ited Berne, was in &s;o deplorable a &s;tate, is
now extremely well regulated, and reflects great honour on
<PB N="6" REF="12">
Mr. Manuel, member of the Great Council, to who&s;e care and
attention this &s;alutary change is chiefly owing. Formerly all
delinquents, without di&s;tinction of crime, were confined in
the &s;ame place; but they are now &s;eparated; and two hou&s;es
are e&s;tabli&s;hed; one called the Hou&s;e of Correction for
greater crimes, and the other the Hou&s;e of Labour for &s;mal|ler
mi&s;demeanors. The pri&s;oners are al&s;o di&s;criminated by
the appellations of <HI>brown</HI> and <HI>blue</HI> from the colour of their
clothes, with which they are &s;upplied gratis during the term
of their confinement. The brown colour is appropriated to
the hou&s;e of correction, the blue to the hou&s;e of labour.
The men and women are lodged in &s;eparate apartments.
Both are con&s;tantly employed, &s;ometimes in cleaning the
&s;treets, and other &s;ervile occupations; at other times they are
taught to read and write, and are in&s;tructed in various
trades, which may a&s;&s;i&s;t them in gaining a maintenance at
the expiration of the time for which they were &s;entenced to
hard labour. By the&s;e means the expence of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
is nearly &s;upported; and an hone&s;t livelihood a&s;&s;ured
afterwards to tho&s;e who would otherwi&s;e prove u&s;ele&s;s or
pernicious members of &s;ociety. There are four tables, at
which the re&s;pective &s;eats are a mark of di&s;tinction appro|priated
to good behaviour, and a larger or le&s;&s;er &s;hare of
provi&s;ion is di&s;tributed to each in proportion to their indu&s;|try.
After having earned their food, the pri&s;oners in the
hou&s;e of labour receive ten per cent. tho&s;e in the hou&s;e of
correction eight per cent. for their extra work.</P>
<P>PUBLIC ju&s;tice is wi&s;ely and impartially admini&s;tered;
and the torture, which had for &s;ome time fallen into di&s;u&s;e,
is now formally aboli&s;hed by a public act of government.
<PB N="7" REF="13">
This humane and ju&s;t act forms a di&s;tingui&s;hed aera in the
hi&s;tory of Swi&s;s juri&s;prudence; as the example of &s;o power|ful
and wi&s;e a government cannot fail producing a general
influence; and it is to be hoped, will be the prelude to its
abolition throughout Switzerland. The &s;olemnity u&s;ed in
pa&s;&s;ing capital &s;entence on a criminal, de&s;erves to be men|tioned
and imitated. The trial being fini&s;hed, the pri&s;oner
is informed of his condemnation by the <HI>Grand Sautier,</HI> or
lieutenant of the police, and attended by two clergymen,
who prepare him for death. On the day appointed for exe|cution,
a large &s;caffolding, covered with a black canopy, is
con&s;tructed in the middle of the principal &s;treet. The ad|voyer,
with a &s;ceptre in his hand, is &s;eated on an elevated
kind of throne between two &s;enators, and attended by the
chancellor and the lieutenant of the police, holding an iron
&s;tick, called the <HI>rod of blood,</HI> all habited in their official robes.
The criminal being brought to the foot of the &s;caffolding
without chains, the chancellor reads aloud the &s;entence of
condemnation, at the conclu&s;ion of which the advoyer bids
the executioner approach, who in&s;tantly binds the arms of
the culprit, and leads him to the place of execution.</P>
<P>THE public library is a &s;mall but well-cho&s;en collection,
and contains 20,000 volumes, a cabinet of Swi&s;s coins and
medals, and many curious manu&s;cripts: of the&s;e, Mr. Sinner,
a man of great erudition, has publi&s;hed a judicious cata|logue.
He has not only &s;et forth their titles, and a&s;certained
their age, but has al&s;o given a general and &s;uccinct account
of their re&s;pective &s;ubjects; and from many has publi&s;hed
extracts equally curious and intere&s;ting. Among the&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="14">
MSS. are &s;ome of the thirteenth century, con&s;i&s;ting of
&s;everal &s;ongs and romances of the Troubadours, written in
that and the preceding ages, which merit the attention of
tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant in that &s;pecies of antient poetry.</P>
<P>LEARNING is neither &s;o univer&s;ally encouraged, nor &s;o
&s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated here as at Zuric; the academical
&s;tudies are almo&s;t &s;olely directed to tho&s;e branches of know|ledge
more e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for entering into the church.
The &s;ociety for the promotion of agriculture, is almo&s;t the
only e&s;tabli&s;hment that directly tends to the progre&s;s of the
arts and &s;ciences; but meets with no great countenance
from government.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="postscript">
<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P><DATE>October 1786.</DATE></P>
<P>I FEEL a very &s;en&s;ible &s;atisfaction on adding, that this
enlightened government no longer merits the reproach of
not &s;ufficiently encouraging the arts and &s;ciences. It is now
awakened from its former lethargy, and begins to perceive
that it is the intere&s;t of every wi&s;e government to e&s;teem and
protect the &s;ciences. The magi&s;trates have lately purcha&s;ed
and appropriated a large man&s;ion for the public library; in|crea&s;ed
the collection of books; and procured from England
an exten&s;ive apparatus of experimental philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>AMONG other undertakings which meet with their en|couragement,
a new map of the canton is now preparing
<PB N="9" REF="15">
under their au&s;pices, by the profe&s;&s;or of experimental philo|&s;ophy,
a great <HI>de&s;ideratum</HI> in the geography of Switzerland,
as the alps of the canton are unfaithfully delineated in all the
maps which have fallen under my ob&s;ervation. I am al&s;o
happy to add, that the Reverend Mr. Wyttenbach has lately
in&s;tituted a literary &s;ociety for the promotion of phy&s;ics
and natural hi&s;tory in general, and that of Switzerland in
particular. In January 1788, this &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ted of ten
members re&s;ident at Berne, of whom &s;everal po&s;&s;e&s;s, and
others are forming, collections agreeable to the plan of the
in&s;titution. The members have e&s;tabli&s;hed regular corre|&s;pondence
in various parts of Europe, and are ready to an|&s;wer
the inquiries of foreign naturali&s;ts, who wi&s;h to be in|formed
concerning any points which relate to the natural
hi&s;tory of this country. An in&s;titution founded on &s;uch
liberal and exten&s;ive principles, and having one object prin|cipally
in view, cannot fail to render the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;er|vice
to &s;cience.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOVERNMENT OF BERNE.</HEAD>
<P>WERE I to attempt entering into an exact di&s;qui&s;ition
concerning the government of Berne; my letter
would not only exceed its proper limits, but would hardly be
contained within the extent of an ordinary pamphlet. I am
per&s;uaded, therefore, you will readily excu&s;e me from putting
your patience to &s;o tedious a trial: but you would probably
think me very incon&s;i&s;tent indeed, if, after having already
de&s;cended into le&s;s intere&s;ting details, I &s;hould pa&s;s over in
&s;ilence a government, the wi&s;dom of who&s;e admini&s;tration is
&s;o ju&s;tly admired. Let me endeavour then to &s;ketch the ge|neral
outlines of this con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE &s;overeign power re&s;ides in the Great Council of two
hundred; which when complete con&s;i&s;ts of two hundred and
ninety-nine members, cho&s;en from the citizens; from
whom they are con&s;idered as deriving their power, and as
acting by deputation. The authority with which they are
inve&s;ted, is in &s;ome re&s;pects the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and uncon|trouled
of any among the ari&s;tocratical &s;tates of Switzerland.
The government of Lucerne is called, indeed, the mo&s;t ari|&s;tocratical
of all the cantons; and it may be &s;o, perhaps,
with re&s;pect to the &s;mall number of families to which the
admini&s;tration of affairs is entru&s;ted: but no war can be de|clared,
no peace concluded, no alliance made, no taxes im|po&s;ed,
<PB N="11" REF="17">
without the con&s;ent of the burghers in a general
a&s;&s;embly. At Friburgh and Soleure the burghers are likewi&s;e
convened upon particular occa&s;ions. Whereas the Great
Council of Berne, &s;ince 1682, when it was declared the &s;ove|reign,
is re&s;trained by no con&s;titutional check of this kind;
as a general a&s;&s;embly of the citizens is never convened on
any occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE executive powers of government are delegated by
this Sovereign Council to the Senate, cho&s;en by them&s;elves
from their own body: the former a&s;&s;embles ordinarily three
times a week, and extraordinarily upon particular occa&s;ions;
the Senate every day, Sundays excepted.</P>
<P>THE &s;enate, compri&s;ing the two advoyers, or chiefs of
the republic, is compo&s;ed of twenty-&s;even members; and
from this &s;elect body are drawn the principal magi&s;trates of
the commonwealth. On a vacancy in the Senate, the mode
of election is as follows:&mdash;Twenty-&s;ix balls, three of which
are golden, are put into a box, and drawn by the &s;everal
members: tho&s;e who draw the three golden balls, nominate
three electors out of their body. In the &s;ame manner of
balloting, &s;even members are cho&s;en from the Great Council,
who al&s;o nominate &s;even electors out of their own body.
The&s;e ten electors fix upon a certain number of candidates,
not exceeding ten, nor le&s;s than &s;ix; and tho&s;e among the&s;e
candidates, who have the fewe&s;t votes in the Sovereign
Council, retire till their number is reduced to four: then
four balls, two golden and two &s;ilver, are drawn by the
four remaining candidates; the two who draw the former
are put in nomination, and he who has the greate&s;t number
<PB N="12" REF="18">
of &s;uffrages in the Sovereign Council, is cho&s;en. But in
order to be eligible, the candidate mu&s;t have been a mem|ber
of the Great Council ten years, and mu&s;t be married, or
a widower.</P>
<P>THE Great Council is generally filled up every ten years;
as within that period there is u&s;ually a deficiency of eighty
members to complete the whole number of two hundred and
ninety-nine: a new election can only be propo&s;ed on a va|cancy
of eighty; and cannot be deferred when there is a
deficiency of a hundred. The time of election being deter|mined
by vote, each advoyer nominates two of the new
members; each &s;eizenier, and each member of the &s;enate,
one each: two or three other officers of &s;tate enjoy the &s;ame
privilege. A few per&s;ons al&s;o claim, by virtue of their
offices, a right of being elected: and their claim is generally
admitted. The&s;e &s;everal nominations and preten&s;ions, com|monly
amount, in the whole, to about fifty of the new
members: the remaining vacancies are &s;upplied by the
&s;uffrages of the &s;enate, and the &s;eizeniers.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Seizeniers</HI> are &s;ixteen members of the Great Council,
drawn yearly from the abbayes or tribes; two from each of
the four great tribes, and one from each of the remaining
eight. The candidates are generally<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay <HI>generally,</HI> becau&s;e it is not ab&s;olutely fixed that all the &s;eizeniers mu&s;t have been bailifs: for if it happens, that in one tribe there are two per&s;ons, one of whom has been a bailif, and the other is a member of the Great Council; they draw lots for the charge. And &s;hould a member of the Great Council be the only one of his tribe, he becomes &s;ei|zenier of cour&s;e, provided he is eligible. In order to be &s;eizenier, the candidate mu&s;t be married, or a widower, and have neither his father or brother in the &s;enate.</NOTE> taken from tho&s;e who
<PB N="13" REF="19">
have exerci&s;ed the office of bailifs; and are elected by lot.
Every year during three days at Ea&s;ter, all other employ|ments
in the &s;tate are &s;u&s;pended, except tho&s;e of the banne|rets
and the &s;eizeniers, who, during this &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, are in|ve&s;ted
with a power &s;imilar to that of the Roman cen&s;ors.
In ca&s;e of mal-admini&s;tration, they may remove any mem|ber
from the Great Council, or from the Senate: but it is a
power which they never exerci&s;e; and &s;hould they think
proper to exert it, the &s;entence mu&s;t be confirmed by
that council.</P>
<P>THE principal magi&s;trates are, two advoyers, the two
trea&s;urers, and the four bannerets: they are each of them
cho&s;en by a majority of voices in the Sovereign Council, and
are yearly confirmed in their re&s;pective offices. The ad|voyers
hold their po&s;t for life; the trea&s;urers, &s;ix years; and
the bannerets, four. At Ea&s;ter the advoyer in office delivers
up his authority, in full council, to his colleague. The <HI>reign|ing</HI>
advoyer &s;its on an elevated feat, under a canopy, and the
&s;eal of the republic lies upon the table before him. He never
delivers his opinion except it is demanded; he enjoys no
vote unle&s;s the numbers are equal; and in that ca&s;e, he has
the ca&s;ting voice. The advoyer out of office, is the fir&s;t &s;e|nator
in rank, and pre&s;ident of the &s;ecret council.</P>
<P>THE two trea&s;urers, one for the German di&s;trict, and the
other for the Pays de Vaud, form, in conjunction with the
four bannerets, an oeconomical chamber, or council of
finances: this council examines and pa&s;&s;es the accounts of
the bailifs, and receives the revenues of all tho&s;e who are
<PB N="14" REF="20">
accountable to government. The four bannerets, toge|ther
with the advoyer out of office, the &s;enior trea&s;urer,
and two members of the Senate, compo&s;e a committee or
&s;ecret council; in which all &s;tate affairs, that require &s;e|crecy,
are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I HAVE only de&s;cribed the&s;e eight magi&s;tracies, as being
the chief offices of the &s;tate, and exerci&s;ed by members of
the Senate. But although the general form of this con&s;ti|tution
is entirely ari&s;tocratical; and the Senate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a
very con&s;iderable influence; yet it does not enjoy that almo&s;t
exclu&s;ive authority, which is ob&s;ervable in many ari&s;tocra|tical
governments. For, by &s;everal wi&s;e and well-ob&s;erved
regulations, the Sovereign Council, although it delegates the
mo&s;t important concerns of government to the Senate, yet
a&s;&s;embles, at &s;tated times, and &s;uperintends the admini&s;tra|tion
of public affairs.</P>
<P>IT may al&s;o be remarked, that although the antient hou&s;es
retain very con&s;iderable influence, and are more readily en|tru&s;ted
with the admini&s;tration of affairs; yet that the prin|cipal
charges of government are not exclu&s;ively confined to
them: many new families being always admitted into the
Sovereign Council on every election. It mu&s;t neverthele&s;s
be acknowledged, that, as the citizens are continually dimi|ni&s;hing,
and their vacancies are never &s;upplied; it would
well become &s;o wi&s;e a government to receive occa&s;ionally
new families into the burgher&s;hip, in order to prevent the
ill effects ari&s;ing from the partial and narrow &s;pirit of too con|&s;ined
an oligarchy. Government is admini&s;tered through|out
<PB N="15" REF="21">
its &s;everal departments with great preci&s;ion, and
every ordinance is executed with as much di&s;patch as in
a monarchical &s;tate. The admini&s;tration of affairs is car|ried
on with great wi&s;dom and moderation, and the rulers
are particularly cautious not to encroach upon the privi|leges
of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE canton of Berne is divided into a certain number of
di&s;tricts, called bailliages; over which, bailifs are cho&s;en
from the Sovereign Council: and, the&s;e po&s;ts being the mo&s;t
profitable in the di&s;po&s;al of government, are the great objects
of general pur&s;uit. Formerly the bailifs, taken indifferently
from the Senate or Great Council, were nominated by the
bannerets; but as this method rendered the members entirely
dependent upon tho&s;e who had the chief credit and influence
in the commonwealth; the mode of election was altered in
1712, and they are now cho&s;en by lot. No competitor, how|ever,
can be received as a candidate, in oppo&s;ition to a more
antient member of the Great Council: for in&s;tance, he who
was admitted in 1766, cannot &s;tand again&s;t one who was
cho&s;en in 1756. None but married men or widowers are
capable of being elected into this office; nor can any per&s;on
occupy more than once the principal bailliages: tho&s;e of a
le&s;s profitable kind may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed three times.</P>
<P>THE &s;everal bailifs are repre&s;entatives of the &s;overeign
power in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts. They enforce the edicts
of government, collect the public revenues, act as ju&s;tices of
the peace, and are judges in civil and criminal cau&s;es, except
<PB N="16" REF="22">
where there is any local<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The lord of the e&s;tate of Die&s;bach enjoys, within his own lands, the &s;ame powers, in criminal affairs, as are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the bailifs in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts.</NOTE> juri&s;diction. In civil cau&s;es, be|yond
a certain value, an appeal lies to the courts of Berne:
in criminal affairs, the proce&s;s is made out in the bailif's
court, undergoes a revi&s;ion in the Senate, and is referred to
the criminal chamber, which inflicts puni&s;hment for &s;mall
mi&s;demeanors. In capital ca&s;es, the &s;entence mu&s;t be con|firmed
by the Senate, and by the Sovereign Council, if the
delinquent is a citizen of Berne. The bailif delivers his ac|counts
to the oeconomical chamber, to which court an appeal
lies, in ca&s;e of exaction, either on the part of the bailif, or of
his officers: and with re&s;pect to tho&s;e mi&s;demeanors that are
puni&s;hable by fine, and of which the bailif is entitled to a
&s;hare; the proportion of the re&s;pective penalties is &s;ettled by
the legi&s;lature with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s, and not
left to the arbitrary deci&s;ion of an intere&s;ted judge.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH from all the&s;e con&s;iderations it &s;hould &s;eem,
that every po&s;&s;ible precaution has been taken by govern|ment
to prevent the extortions of the bailifs; yet in&s;tances
have not been wanting to prove, that the&s;e wi&s;e and &s;trict
regulations may be eluded: but it is no le&s;s certain, that
where bailifs have been guilty of oppre&s;&s;ions, frequent ex|amples
occur of their being impartially and &s;everely puni&s;h|ed.
The profits of this office ari&s;e from the produce of the
deme&s;nes, of the tythes, and certain duties paid to govern|ment
in the re&s;pective bailliages. In &s;ome parts of the Ger|man
divi&s;ion, the bailif is entitled, upon the death of every
<PB N="17" REF="23">
pea&s;ant, to a determinate part of the inheritance: although
his &s;hare is very incon&s;iderable, yet in &s;ome &s;ituations it may
prove an oppre&s;&s;ive tax upon the family. This tax is the
only in&s;tance that has fallen under my knowledge, where
the pea&s;ants of this canton are liable to any impo&s;ition,
which can ju&s;tly be deemed grievous.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH there are no &s;tanding armies in Switzerland;
yet in many of the cantons, and particularly in Berne, the
militia is &s;o well regulated, that government could a&s;&s;emble
a very con&s;iderable body of men at a moment's warning.
To this end, every male at the age of &s;ixteen is enrolled in
the militia; and about a third of the whole number are
formed into particular regiments, compo&s;ed of fu&s;ileers and
electionaries; the former con&s;i&s;ting of batchelors, and the
latter of married men. Every per&s;on thus enrolled, is
obliged to provide him&s;elf, at his own expence, with an uni|form,
a mu&s;ket, and a certain quantity of powder and ball:
and no pea&s;ant is allowed to marry, unle&s;s he produces his
uniform and arms. Every year a certain number of officers,
who are called Land Majors, are deputed by the council of
war, throughout the canton, to in&s;pect the arms of the &s;ol|diers;
to complete the regiments, and exerci&s;e the militia:
upon their return they make their report to that council.
Be&s;ide this annual review, the regiments are occa&s;ionally ex|erci&s;ed
by veteran &s;oldiers, appointed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BESIDE the arms in the ar&s;enal of Berne, a certain quan|tity
is al&s;o provided, in the ar&s;enal of each bailliage, &s;uffi|cient
for the militia of that di&s;trict; and likewi&s;e a &s;um of
<PB N="18" REF="24">
money amounting to three months pay, which is appro|priated
to the electionaries in ca&s;e of actual &s;ervice. The
dragoons are cho&s;en from the &s;ub&s;tantial farmers; as each
per&s;on is obliged to provide his hor&s;e and accoutrements.
In time of peace, the advoyer out of office, is pre&s;ident of the
council of war, and a member of that council is commander
of the militia in the Pays de Vaud; but during war a general
in chief is nominated, who commands the forces of the re|public.
A certain number of regiments being thus always in
readine&s;s, &s;ignals are fixed on the highe&s;t part of each bail|liage,
for a&s;&s;embling the militia at a particular place in each
di&s;trict; where they receive orders for marching.</P>
<P>BEFORE I clo&s;e this letter, I &s;hall ju&s;t mention an in&s;titu|tion,
called the <HI>Exterior State,</HI> as remarkable for its &s;ingula|rity
as its utility. It is a model of the Sovereign Council,
and is compo&s;ed of tho&s;e burghers, who have not attained the
age requi&s;ite for entering into that Council. It has a Great
Council, a Senate, two advoyers, trea&s;urers, bannerets, and
&s;eizeniers; all of whom are cho&s;en in the u&s;ual manner, and
with the accu&s;tomed ceremonies. The po&s;t of advoyer in
this mimic community is &s;olicited with great a&s;&s;iduity, and
&s;ometimes obtained at a con&s;iderable expence; as the &s;uc|ce&s;sful
candidate is always admitted into the Great Council,
without any farther recommendation. This body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
a certain number of bailliages, which con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal
ruined ca&s;tles di&s;per&s;ed over the canton: it has al&s;o its com|mon
trea&s;ure, and its debts. In this article, however, it by
no means re&s;embles the actual government of Berne, which
is not only free from debts, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very con&s;ider|able
<PB N="19" REF="25">
fund in re&s;erve. This remarkable in&s;titution, may be
con&s;idered as a political &s;eminary for the youth of Berne.
It renders them acquainted with the forms of the con&s;titu|tion;
and, as the members debate upon all kinds of political
&s;ubjects, affords them an opportunity of exerci&s;ing and im|proving
their talents, and by that means of becoming more
capable of &s;erving the public, whenever they may be ad|mitted
to a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of government.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">BIOGRAPHICAL AND LITERARY ANECDOTES
OF HALLER.</HEAD>
<P>BERNE has produced few men highly eminent in li|terature;
but has e&s;tabli&s;hed her glory in being the
birth-place of the celebrated Haller.</P>
<P>ALBERT HALLER<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The materials for this biographical &s;ketch, are chiefly collected from the fol|lowing lives of this great man, which, as I was informed, by his elde&s;t &s;on, &s;ince decea&s;ed, are tho&s;e to which mo&s;t credit may be given. 1. <HI>Leben des Herrn von Haller,</HI> by George Zimmerman. Zuric, 1755. The author was the di&s;ciple and friend of Haller. 2. <HI>Lobrede auf Herrn Albrecht von Haller, von Herrn von Bal|tha&s;ar.</HI> Ba&s;el, 1778. The author was Haller's intimate friend, and was well ac|quainted with the principal events of his life. He is the &s;ame gentleman whom I have mentioned in vol. i. Letter 23. 3. <HI>Lo|brede auf Herrn Albert Haller.</HI> Durch, V. B. <HI>T&s;charner des Gro&s;&s;en Raths, &amp;c.</HI> Berne, 1778. Mr. T&s;charner, being a native of Berne, and an intimate acquaint|ance of Haller, his account de&s;erves implicit credit. He was author of &s;everal e&s;teemed works on the topography and hi&s;tory of Switzerland. He died in 1778, a &s;hort time after he had pronounced this panegyric on his decea&s;ed friend. 4. <HI>Eloge Hi&s;torique d'Albert de Haller, avec un Catalogue de &s;es Oeuvres.</HI> Geneve, 1778. Sennebier, the writer of this eulogium, is well known as the learned author of <HI>Bibliotheque de Geneve,</HI> and of <HI>Hi&s;toire Literaire de Geneve.</HI> He informs us, that he received &s;everal anec|dotes from the family of Haller.
Many other panegyrics and lives of Haller have been publi&s;hed in various parts of Europe; but as they were mo&s;tly written by tho&s;e who were not per&s;onally acquainted with him, I have not cited them as autho|rities. His &s;on mentions nineteen lives and panegyrics of his father, that had fallen under his notice in 1784. See Bibl. Schweit. Ge&s;hic. vol. ii. N&deg; 882&mdash;906. I have been enabled to add &s;everal anecdotes which I procured at Berne, and from his elde&s;t &s;on the late bailif of Nyon.
The complete&s;t li&s;t of Haller's works is to be found in the 6th volume of &startq;<HI>Epi&s;tolae ad Hallerum &s;criptae.</HI>&endq; Berne, 1775. His &s;ub&s;equent publications may be &s;upplied from Sennebier's catalogue.</NOTE>, the younge&s;t of five brothers, was
born on the 16th of October 1708. His father, Emanuel
<PB N="21" REF="27">
Haller, a citizen of Berne, practi&s;ed the law as an advocate
with great &s;ucce&s;s; and in 1713, removed from the capital
to Baden, where he was appointed &s;ecretary of that
bailliage.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH many accounts are u&s;ually related concern|ing
the early genius of di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons, which do not
always de&s;erve implicit credit; yet the premature abilities
and application of Haller are inconte&s;tably proved. When
he had &s;carcely attained his fifth year he was accu&s;tomed to
write the new words, which he recollected to have heard in
the cour&s;e of the day. His progre&s;s in the languages was &s;o
rapid, that in his tenth year he could tran&s;late from the
Greek, and compo&s;ed for his own private u&s;e a Chaldaic
grammar, a Greek and Hebrew lexicon. His pa&s;&s;ion for
letters was al&s;o &s;o general and ardent, that, about the &s;ame
period, he abridged from Bayle and Moreri an hi&s;torical
dictionary, compri&s;ing above two thou&s;and lives, and di&s;|tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf by a &s;atire in Latin ver&s;e again&s;t his
preceptor Abraham Baillodz, a per&s;on of con&s;iderable learn|ing,
but of a capricious and moro&s;e di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>SUCH unwearied application, and a&s;toni&s;hing progre&s;s,
in a youth of his years, ought to have en&s;ured the ap|probation
and encouragement of his family. On the
contrary, his father, who had de&s;tined him to the law, re|proved
his growing ta&s;te for polite literature, was particularly
offended at his inclination for poetry, as likely to draw him
from the &s;everer occupations, and objected to the variety of
his pur&s;uits as too de&s;ultory and &s;uperficial. He did not
con&s;ider, that, during childhood, the principal requi&s;ite of
<PB N="22" REF="28">
education is to infu&s;e a ta&s;te for application in general; and,
that when the ba&s;e of education is rendered as broad as po&s;|&s;ible,
like a pyramid, it may always be reduced to a point.
But neither his father's repeated exhortations, nor his pre|ceptor's
&s;evere admonitions, could oblige the youth to confine
his &s;tudies to one object, or check his in&s;atiable thir&s;t for
general information. In this manner he was educated until
1721, when, on his father's death, he was removed to the
public &s;chool at Berne. He was placed in a cla&s;s far above
his age; and u&s;ually wrote in Greek the exerci&s;e, which he
was expected to compo&s;e in the Latin tongue. In 1723, he
obtained permi&s;&s;ion to accompany a young friend to Bienne,
in order to be in&s;tructed in philo&s;ophy by the father of his
companion, who was a celebrated phy&s;ician. But his new
preceptor being a bigot to the Carte&s;ian &s;chool, Haller &s;oon
rejected with di&s;dain that logic and philo&s;ophy, which tended
to cramp his genius rather than extend his knowledge; and
continued to cultivate hi&s;tory, poetry, and polite literature,
but with as little order and method as might be expected
from his years.</P>
<P>HALLER, during his re&s;idence at Bienne, began a cu&s;tom,
which he afterwards followed through life, that of writing
his opinion of the books which he peru&s;ed, and making
large extracts from them. His genius being al&s;o awakened
by the romantic &s;cenery of the country to poetical en|thu&s;ia&s;m,
he compo&s;ed various pieces in the epic, dramatic,
and lyric &s;tyles. He was at this time &s;o entirely ab&s;orbed in
this favourite &s;tudy, that, on a $ire breaking out in the
hou&s;e in which he re&s;ided, he ru&s;hed into his apartment,
and re&s;cued his poetry from the flames, leaving his other
<PB N="23" REF="29">
papers, with little regret, to de&s;truction. Afterwards, when
a more mature age had ripened his judgment, he was fre|quently
heard to &s;ay, that he had pre&s;erved from the flames
tho&s;e compo&s;itions which he then thought the fine&s;t pro|ductions
of human genius, in order at a future period to con|&s;ign
them to de&s;truction as unworthy of his pen<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Many of his biographers have con|founded the&s;e two facts; and, from a na|tural pronene&s;s to exaggeration, have a&s;&s;erted, that at Bienne, Haller, with a greatne&s;s of mind above his years, burned his poetical compo&s;itions, from a &s;trong conviction, that poetry tended to alienate his mind from the &s;everer &s;tudies: whereas, the very contrary happened. He &s;aved his poetical pieces in preference to his other papers, and burned them afterwards, becau&s;e they would have di&s;graced his re|putation: although, as juvenile productions, they were not wholly without merit. I have in this in&s;tance preferred the authority of his particular friends, Baltha&s;ar and T&s;charner, to his other biographers, who had not &s;uch opportunities of obtaining the truth. Be&s;ides, as a confirmation of their evidence, Haller did not intermit his poetical &s;tudies; and wrote at Tubingen his <HI>Morgen-gedanken</HI> and <HI>Sehn-Sucht,</HI> which are the earlie&s;t &s;pecimens he ever gave to the public.</NOTE>. In this
period of life, Haller compares him&s;elf to a wild plant, which
is left to grow without pruning; and this very circum&s;tance
was probably the principal cau&s;e of his future proficiency,
and the foundation of that univer&s;al knowledge, to which
he afterwards attained.</P>
<P>HE had been originally intended for the law: but his
active mind could not &s;ubmit to follow a profe&s;&s;ion which
would limit his inquiries; which entirely depended on pre|cedent
and authority; and which, to u&s;e his own quotation
from Horace, in a letter to his friend Bonnet, obliged him,
<Q>Jurare in verba magi&s;tri.</Q>
And although he could not &s;ubmit to the &s;hackles of that
narrow philo&s;ophy, &s;o &s;trongly recommended and enforced
<PB N="24" REF="30">
by his new preceptor, yet he appears to have been prin|cipally
determined by his advice to dedicate him&s;elf to
phy&s;ic; the &s;tudy of which comprehends &s;uch a variety of
literary pur&s;uits, as &s;eemed congenial to the zeal and activity
of his capacious mind. He had no &s;ooner formed this re|&s;olution,
than he adopted a more regular and uniform plan,
than he had hitherto been able to pur&s;ue. For this purpo&s;e
he removed, towards the end of 1723, to the univer&s;ity of
Tubingen, where, under the profe&s;&s;ors Elias Camerarius and
Du Vernoy, he pro&s;ecuted his &s;tudies with that unwearied
application, which never for&s;ook him. From Camerarius he
learned tho&s;e &s;ound principles of rational philo&s;ophy, which
teach us fir&s;t to doubt, and afterwards to believe; and which
are as far removed from credulity on one hand, as from &s;cep|tici&s;m
on the other. From the lectures of Du Vernoy he
imbibed his fir&s;t ta&s;te for botany, and made &s;o rapid a pro|gre&s;s
in the &s;tudy of anatomy, that his ma&s;ter predicted,
from &s;everal di&s;&s;ertations, his future proficiency in that
&s;cience. Notwith&s;tanding his &s;trong and invariable at|tachment
to the&s;e two branches of natural hi&s;tory, he repre|&s;ents
him&s;elf as &s;tudying, <HI>invit&acirc; minerv&acirc;,</HI> again&s;t nature;
anatomy though he could not &s;upport bad &s;mells, and botany
though he was extremely &s;hort-&s;ighted. At Tubingen he
al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed his knowledge in mineralogy by refuting
the error of Tournefort, in a&s;cribing to fo&s;&s;ils a vegetating
power.</P>
<P>DURING his continuance in that univer&s;ity, he gave an
in&s;tance of his early controul over his pa&s;&s;ions; a difficult
conque&s;t for a young man of &s;trong feelings and lively ima|gination.
A &s;ingle deviation into exce&s;s, into which he had
<PB N="25" REF="31">
been hurried by the example of &s;ome of his fellow-pupils,
&s;o greatly affected a per&s;on like him, no le&s;s enamoured of
virtue, than &s;u&s;ceptible of ingenuous &s;hame, that he in&s;tantly
formed a re&s;olution to ab&s;tain from wine; and adopted a
&s;trictne&s;s of morals, which renders highly probable the
a&s;&s;ertion of his French encomia&s;t, the Marquis de Condorcet,
that he was de&s;cended from a family, in which piety might
be &s;aid to be hereditary.</P>
<P>IN 1725, Haller repaired to Leyden, to which place he
was drawn by the great reputation of Boerhaave. Here he
&s;ound a more ample field for the improvement of his mind,
and the di&s;play of his abilities. He became the favourite
&s;cholar of Boerhaave, by who&s;e example and encouragement
he &s;trengthened his growing inclination for botany. He
noted down his ma&s;ter's lectures on the <HI>In&s;titutes of Medicine</HI>
with &s;uch preci&s;ion, as afterwards gave birth to one of his
mo&s;t u&s;eful publications. He continued his anatomical
&s;tudies under Albinus, ju&s;t then ri&s;ing into &s;ame, and the
venerable Ruy&s;ch, who &s;o highly improved the art of in|jecting
anatomical preparations. The precarious &s;tate of
his health, probably occa&s;ioned, or at lea&s;t increa&s;ed, by his
inten&s;e application, induced him to accompany two of his
countrymen through part of Germany. On his return, in
1726, he received his doctor's degree, though only in the
nineteenth year of his age; and publi&s;hed on that occa&s;ion
his inaugural di&s;&s;ertation <HI>de Ductu &s;alivali Co&s;chwiziano.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1727 he vi&s;ited England, was favourably received by
Che&s;elden, Douglas, and Sir Hans Sloane; and improved
<PB N="26" REF="32">
his knowledge of medicine and &s;urgery under the au&s;pices
of tho&s;e celebrated men, and by diligently attending the
ho&s;pitals. At Paris, whither he next directed his cour&s;e,
he &s;tudied botany under Geoffroy and Ju&s;&s;ieu; anatomy
under Le Dran and Win&s;low, a celebrated &s;urgeon. Win&s;low
was indeed his favourite ma&s;ter, to whom he particularly
attached him&s;elf; whom he propo&s;ed to his di&s;ciples as the
be&s;t model for their imitation, as an anatomi&s;t, who, &s;hackled
by no &s;y&s;tem, de&s;cribed &s;imply and faithfully what he him|&s;elf
ob&s;erved in his di&s;&s;ections.</P>
<P>HALLER had propo&s;ed to continue his travels to Italy, that
country where medicinal knowledge fir&s;t revived in the
darker ages, and where,
<Q>&startq;Smit with the love of &s;acred &s;ong,&endq;</Q>
he might indulge his enthu&s;ia&s;m and improve his ta&s;te in
cla&s;&s;ical literature. The uncertain &s;tate of his health, the
<HI>maladie du pays</HI> which &s;o remarkably affects the Swi&s;s in
foreign parts, and on which he has compo&s;ed a poem,
together with the advice of his friends, prevailed over his
inclination, and induced him to return to his native city.</P>
<P>IN his way to Berne he &s;topped at Ba&s;le, in order to &s;tudy
mathematics and algebra under the celebrated John Ber|noulli;
and in this, as well as every other in&s;tance of his
life, applied with &s;uch indefatigable per&s;everance, as if tho&s;e
&s;ciences were to form the &s;ole object of his future re&s;earches.
His proficiency in the&s;e &s;tudies is &s;ufficiently proved by
<PB N="27" REF="33">
&s;everal treati&s;es &s;till extant in manu&s;cript, which he com|po&s;ed
on arithmetic and geometry, and particularly by his
remarks on the Marquis de l'Ho&s;pital's Analy&s;is of Infinite|&s;imals;
and his attachment to them by his being deeply
employed in a profound calculation on the day of his mar|riage.
But though he made &s;uch a progre&s;s as a&s;toni&s;hed
Bernoulli him&s;elf, he continued his other pur&s;uits, being
appointed to read lectures on anatomy during the &s;ickne&s;s
of the profe&s;&s;or: while he fulfilled the duties of that office,
he al&s;o attended the lectures of Tzinger on the practical parts
of medicine; thus at the &s;ame time di&s;playing, with equal
propriety, the dignity of a profe&s;&s;or, and the humility of
a pupil. During the &s;ummer of 1729, he, in company with
his friend John Ge&s;ner, made an excur&s;ion into the moun|tains
of Switzerland; an excur&s;ion rendered memorable by
its &s;ugge&s;ting to him the plan of a <HI>Flora Helvetica,</HI> and by
in&s;piring his poem on the Alps, which he compo&s;ed in the
21&s;t year of his age; a poem as &s;ublime and immortal as the
mountains which are the &s;ubject of his &s;ong.</P>
<P>NOT to interrupt the&s;e biographical anecdotes with a
chronological detail of his poetical productions, I &s;hall ju&s;t
mention, that, not long after his poem on the Alps, he wrote
his ethic epi&s;tles, on the Imperfection of Human Virtue,
on Super&s;tition and In$idelity, on the Origin of Evil, on the
Vanity of Honour, Various Satires, Doris, a Pa&s;toral on his
fir&s;t wife, and his much admired Elegy on her death. It is
a convincing proof of Haller's ver&s;atile genius and extraor|dinary
mental powers, that he &s;hould have &s;o eminently
excelled in poetry, which, except in his early youth, he
<PB N="28" REF="34">
never con&s;idered otherwi&s;e than as an amu&s;ement, either to
&s;ooth him under afflictions, and in the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, or
to con&s;ole him for the envy and neglect of his contem|poraries.</P>
<P>THE $ounde&s;t German critics place Haller among the mo&s;t
eminent of their poets; and con&s;ider &s;ublimity as the grand
characteri&s;tic of his writings. They acknowledge, that he
improved the harmony and richne&s;s of his native tongue;
that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t powers of invention and fancy;
great originality both in his ideas and language; that he is
the true colouri&s;t of nature; that he &s;ounded the depths of
metaphy&s;ical and moral &s;cience; that he equally excels in
picture&s;que de&s;criptions, in &s;oft and delightful imagery, in
elevated &s;entiments, and philo&s;ophical preci&s;ion. A few
&s;upercilious critics have reproached his poetry with occa|&s;ional
ob&s;curities; and accu&s;e him of having introduced a
new language affectedly aver&s;e to the common modes of
diction. Cold critici&s;m may cen&s;ure; but twenty-two &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
editions of his German poems, and the tran&s;lation of
them into the principal languages of Europe, prove, that
they po&s;&s;e&s;s the great aim of poetry, that of plea&s;ing and
intere&s;ting the reader. And it may be remarked with truth,
that although Haller's &s;tupendous labours in erudition and
&s;cience render his poetical talents of inferior account; yet
that if he had confined him&s;elf to poetry, that alone would
have immortalized his name.</P>
<P>BUT it is time to accompany Haller to his native city,
where he returned, in 1729, expecting from his countrymen
<PB N="29" REF="35">
that re&s;pect and patronage, he had &s;o liberally received
abroad. But he had the mortification to experience that
neglect, and even envy, to which every man of genius is ex|po&s;ed
in his own country, and which he &s;eems to have aug|mented
by his &s;atirical compo&s;itions. He continued three
years without having the intere&s;t to procure any public em|ployment;
and, though he prevailed on Government to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
an anatomical theatre, and gave lectures gratis; he did
not &s;ucceed in obtaining the place of phy&s;ician to the ho&s;pi|tal,
which he much de&s;ired. He al&s;o &s;olicited a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip,
and was again repul&s;ed. He &s;eems to have &s;en&s;ibly felt the&s;e
di&s;appointments, and expre&s;&s;ed his impatience and indigna|tion
in his &s;atirical poems. In&s;tead, however, of damping
his activity or abating the ardour of his genius, he redou|bled
his application and &s;ervices in order to force him&s;elf
into public notice.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing tribute to his literary talents was
paid by the Royal Society of Up&s;ala, which, in 1735, cho&s;e
him a member. This election was the prelude to more ho|nourable
and beneficial employments. In the &s;ame year his
countrymen acknowledged his merit, by appointing him
director of the ho&s;pital, and public librarian. As director of
the ho&s;pital, he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his zeal and huma|nity.
As librarian, he be&s;towed great pains in arranging the
books, and in forming the fir&s;t catalogue. Scarcely any
branch of literature, however remote from his u&s;ual occupa|tions,
was omitted by Haller, whenever an opportunity pre|&s;ented
it&s;elf, either of improving his general knowledge,
or of being u&s;eful to &s;cience. Finding in the public library
<PB N="30" REF="36">
a collection of antient medals, which had been hitherto
neglected; he took con&s;iderable plea&s;ure in cla&s;&s;ing them.
His love of hi&s;tory led him to pay great attention to the &s;tudy
of medals, which he ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the mo&s;t authentic
documents of hi&s;torical truth, and the mo&s;t certain monu|ments
to a&s;certain the ever-fluctuating &s;tate of language.</P>
<P>HIS literary reputation began now to &s;pread it&s;elf by va|rious
botanical, anatomical, and medical publications, and by
a collection of poems<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ver&s;uch Schweitzeri&s;cher Gedichte.</HI> The be&s;t edition is printed at Berne, 1775.</NOTE>, which fir&s;t made its appearance in
1732. At length, in 1736, he received, un&s;olicited on his part,
the offer of the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of phy&s;ic, botany, and &s;urgery,
in the univer&s;ity of Gottingen, newly e&s;tabli&s;hed by George
the Second. Notwith&s;tanding all the advantages and honours
which accompanied this offer, he, for &s;ome time, he&s;itated
whether he &s;hould accept it. He had, in 1731, e&s;pou&s;ed a
young lady of good family, who&s;e great beauty and accom|pli&s;hments
were rendered &s;till more endearing by her
affectionate &s;ub&s;erviency to his manner of life. She had
brought him three children; and the&s;e ties attached him
more &s;trongly to his native place, where his merits had pro|cured
him many &s;incere friends; and the air of which he
con&s;idered as in &s;ome re&s;pect nece&s;&s;ary for the continuance
of his health. On the other hand, the honour of being in|vited
by &s;o great a monarch, the dignity of the e&s;tabli&s;hment
to which he was called, and the con&s;ideration of having a
more ample theatre for the improvement of his knowledge,
induced him to remove to Gottingen.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="37">
HE quitted Berne with much regret; pre&s;aging, as it
were, the heavy &s;troke which overtook him &s;oon after his
arrival in that univer&s;ity. He lo&s;t his wife. The death of
his beloved Marianne, who&s;e memory he has celebrated in a
pathetic elegy, afflicted him &s;o deeply, that it almo&s;t brought
him to the grave. In this cri&s;is of de&s;pondency he redoubled
his application, as the mo&s;t probable means of &s;ubduing his
&s;orrow; and the duties of his &s;tation forced him from the
contemplation of his own grief into public life. During
&s;eventeen years, in which he re&s;ided at Gottingen, his abili|ties
expanded in proportion as his opportunities of acquiring
knowledge increa&s;ed; he obtained from government the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of a botanical garden, which he &s;uperintended,
of an anatomical theatre, a &s;chool for midwifery, and a col|lege
for the improvement of &s;urgery. He formed the plan
for a Royal Society of Sciences, of which he was appointed
perpetual pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>THE comprehen&s;ive mind and ver&s;atile genius of Haller,
united with unremitting diligence and ardour in all his pur|&s;uits,
enabled him to cultivate with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s, a
variety of knowledge. Had not the great Swede pre-occupied
the field, Haller would have &s;tood the fir&s;t among his con|temporaries
as an improver of botanical knowledge<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I &s;hould not have pre&s;umed to have given any detailed account of Haller's botanical, medical, or anatomical works, if I had not received a&s;&s;i&s;tance on the&s;e &s;ubjects from my very judicious friend Dr. Pulteney.</NOTE>. Yet
botany was not among his earlie&s;t pur&s;uits, for he informs
us, that he had made no advances in it until his return from
his travels: during his re&s;idence at Ba&s;le, in the year 1728,
<PB N="32" REF="38">
as if in&s;pired, he &s;ays, by the genius of that place, which
had nurtured the Bauhins, and where at that period botany
was &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated by Staehlin, he laid the de&s;ign of
his future Flora. From this time he made annual journies
into various parts of Switzerland, and principally among the
Alps. He cultivated the corre&s;pondence of the mo&s;t eminent
botani&s;ts; particularly with Scheutzer, Ludwig, Linnaeus,
Van Royen, and Dr. John Ge&s;ner of Zuric, who had al&s;o
meditated a de&s;ign to publi&s;h a Swi&s;s Flora, and freely com|municated
his materials to Haller.</P>
<P>HIS e&s;tabli&s;hment at Gottingen afterwards enlarged his
views and opportunities; and at length, in 1742, his great
botanical work on the plants of Switzerland, the re&s;ult of
fourteen years &s;tudy, made its appearance. It was entitled,
<HI>Enumeratio Methodica Stirpium Helvetiae,</HI> in 2 vols. folio. It
was the mo&s;t copious Flora the world had ever &s;een, com|pri&s;ing
1,840 &s;pecies, and was enriched with &s;everal advan|tages,
that rendered it &s;ingularly acceptable. The preface
contains a compendious geographical de&s;cription of Swit|zerland,
and of the Alps particularly; an account of all the
authors who had written on the plants of that country; the re|cital
of his own journies; acknowledgments to tho&s;e who had
a&s;&s;i&s;ted him; concluding with the order and method he means
to pur&s;ue in this work. After the preface follows a chro|nological
account of 268 volumes, which he cites in the
work, each accompanied by a general character; in which,
with great candour and impartiality, he points out the merit or
demerit of the author, in the manner which he afterwards
pur&s;ued in the <HI>Methodus Studii Medici,</HI> and in the <HI>Bibliotheca
<PB N="33" REF="39">
Medicinae.</HI> This is in reality a very u&s;eful and entertaining
part of his work, ina&s;much as it forms almo&s;t a hi&s;tory of
the progre&s;s of the &s;cience, from the time of Brunfel&s;ius to
his own.</P>
<P>HE next delineates his own &s;y&s;tem of botany, according
to which the plants are di&s;po&s;ed. Throughout this great
work, Haller is entirely an original: not &s;atisfying him&s;elf
with giving the de&s;criptions of former writers, he appears
every where to have de&s;cribed the plant him&s;elf, and to have
formed new genera, and commonly new &s;pecifical characters
for the whole, accommodated to his own &s;y&s;tem. He in|forms
us, that it was his cu&s;tom to write down the natural
characters of each plant on the day he found it. In treating
on each &s;pecies, he has not only added a mo&s;t copious num|ber
of &s;ynonymes, but, un&s;atisfied with Bauhin's Pinax, he
appears to have con&s;ulted all the old authors, extricated their
&s;ynonymes, with uncommon diligence and &s;ingular di&s;crimi|nation,
and arranged them, as much as po&s;&s;ible, in chrono|logical
order; a method highly worthy of imitation, as it
exhibits at one view, a brief hi&s;tory of the plant, by point|ing
out the fir&s;t di&s;coverer, and the regions of its growth.
This to the curious botani&s;t, is a very meritorious part of
Haller's labour. To each is &s;ubjoined a &s;ummary account,
from the be&s;t writers, of the qualities and u&s;es, both oeconomi|cal
and medical. The work is embelli&s;hed with plates of &s;ome
rare &s;pecies, remarkable for their exactne&s;s and delicacy.</P>
<P>HAVING, in 1741, obtained from the king of Great Bri|tain
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the phy&s;ic garden at Gottingen,
<PB N="34" REF="40">
Haller publi&s;hed the following year a catalogue of its plants.
This was but a &s;mall volume, but the li&s;t &s;erved to &s;hew the
diligence with which he had fulfilled the intention of the
royal founder. In 1753 he much enlarged it, and compre|hended
the plants &s;pontaneou&s;ly growing in the environs,
e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Black Fore&s;t. He informs us, that
this volume was the production of a three months vacation,
and laments, that the importance of his other employments
prevented him from fulfilling his intention of de&s;cribing
the plants of Germany at large. This little work is curious,
&s;ince it exemplifies his &s;y&s;tem as extended to exotics, of
which the new and rare kinds are herein de&s;cribed. But the
&s;mall &s;ize of the volume precluded the introduction of the
generical characters.</P>
<P>IN 1745, he gratified the botani&s;ts by a new edition of the
<HI>Flora Jenen&s;is</HI> of Ruppius; and, that he might do ju&s;tice to
his author, he took a journey to Jena, where he gained acce&s;s
to the papers and <HI>hortus &s;iccus</HI> of the author. He prefixed
to this book anecdotes of this extraordinary man; and, by
reforming the whole, and augmenting it with many plants,
di&s;covered by him&s;elf, he in &s;ome mea&s;ure made it a <HI>Flora
Germanica.</HI> The&s;e performances were by no means the
termination of his botanical labours. On his return to Swit|zerland
he continued his di&s;coveries in this branch of na|tural
hi&s;tory; he al&s;o &s;ent, at his own expence, per&s;ons pro|perly
qualified into the le&s;s frequented parts of Switzerland.
The re&s;ult appeared in a new edition of the <HI>Enumeratio,</HI>
which was &s;o much improved and altered, that he con&s;iders
it as a new work. It was publi&s;hed in three vol. fol. in 1768,
<PB N="35" REF="41">
under the title of <HI>Hi&s;toria Stirpium indigenarum Helvetiae,
inchoata.</HI> The &s;ubject is arranged in his own method, with
the alteration of inverting the order of the cla&s;&s;es, beginning
with the <HI>Compo&s;itae,</HI> or the <HI>Syngene&s;ia</HI> cla&s;s of Linnaeus, and
ending with the <HI>Cryptogamia,</HI> which &s;tood fir&s;t in the <HI>Enu|meratio;</HI>
both of which are objectionable, as &s;ubjecting the
&s;tudent to the mo&s;t difficult parts of the &s;y&s;tem at his en|trance
on the &s;tudy. Several intere&s;ting particulars of the
former publication are al&s;o omitted in the&s;e volumes, of
which curious botani&s;ts will much regret the lo&s;s: for
though he has in&s;erted, with enlargement, the phy&s;ical geo|graphy
of Switzerland, together with the account of tho&s;e
authors who had previou&s;ly inve&s;tigated the plants of the
country, and has recited his own excur&s;ions for that pur|po&s;e;
yet he has not introduced the critical catalogue of the
authors, &s;atisfying him&s;elf with giving a bare li&s;t of all the
botanical writings, from the time of Theophra&s;tus to the
year 1768. It is &s;till more to be regretted, that Haller has
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed, in this edition, a great number of &s;ynonymes
under each plant; in&s;erting only a few of tho&s;e of later date.
It may further be remarked, that although in all po&s;&s;ible in|&s;tances
he has introduced the &s;ynonymes of Linnaeus, yet he
has, unfortunately for &s;uch as u&s;e the works of both, omit|ted
the trivial names; a circum&s;tance which renders his
book much le&s;s u&s;eful to tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant in the &s;ex|ual
&s;y&s;tem. Yet, if the&s;e are defects, they are doubtle&s;s
more than compen&s;ated, by the innumerable improvements
made in the de&s;criptions, both of the genera and &s;pecies, by
the great addition to the number of plants, which are ex|tended
from 1840 to 2486, of which more than 800 are of the
<PB N="36" REF="42">
Cryptogamia cla&s;s; Haller having, after Micheli, beyond any
of his contemporaries, enlarged the order of Fungi, of which
he tells us, he had the paintings of more than 400 &s;pecies
drawn under his own in&s;pection. It is not, however, &s;ur|pri&s;ing,
that Switzerland &s;hould produce a greater variety of
vegetables than the middle parts of Europe; when we reflect
that the alpine &s;ituations afford growth to the plants of the
arctic regions, and the warm vallies of the &s;ame country, to
many of tho&s;e common to &s;outhern. The value of this
edition is much enhanced by enlarging the ob&s;ervations on
the u&s;es of plants; and by referring to his authorities for
what is not his own, with his accu&s;tomed accuracy. As an
acce&s;&s;ion to this work, it may be added, that the author has,
in the notes, under each genus, introduced the plants of
Theophra&s;tus and Dio&s;corides, in as many in&s;tances as they
admit of being a&s;certained.</P>
<P>FEW botani&s;ts have laboured more than Haller; and yet
his di&s;coveries in botany occupied only a comparatively &s;mall
portion of his time. To &s;uch as feel not, in the fulle&s;t ex|tent,
that enthu&s;ia&s;m which the love of &s;cience creates, it
may appear a paradox to a&s;&s;ert, that the di&s;&s;ection of human
bodies could be a plea&s;urable employment; yet Haller, in
1742, pronounced an elegant and &s;pirited eulogium, in the
univer&s;ity of Gottingen, to prove it; and his zeal in the pur|&s;uit
of anatomical di&s;coveries was attended with uncommon
&s;ucce&s;s. He &s;eems early to have apprehended, that the
knowledge of the di&s;tribution of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, had not
kept pace with that of the bones, mu&s;cles, nerves, and vi&s;|cera,
which had been &s;eparately and ably treated by men of
<PB N="37" REF="43">
eminence. Haller, therefore, wi&s;hed to illu&s;trate more per|fectly
this part of the human body; and he gave to the world
a more complete &s;y&s;tem on the &s;ubject than had yet appear|ed.
He publi&s;hed the fir&s;t part of this great work in 1743,
and the la&s;t in 1756. His tracts on other parts of anatomy,
when collected in 1768, form three vols. in 4to. The cu|rious
reader may &s;ee an enumeration of his many di&s;coveries
in anatomy and phy&s;iology, at the head of the &s;ixth volume
of his Phy&s;iology: and although &s;ome of the&s;e di&s;coveries
may have been conte&s;ted by his contemporaries; yet his
unalienable right to mo&s;t of them, and the light particularly
which he threw upon incubation, o&s;&s;ification, irritability,
and &s;everal other parts of the animal oeconomy, will un|que&s;tionably
&s;ecure to him a large and honourable &s;hare of
fame with po&s;terity.</P>
<P>HALLER'S emoluments augmented as his merits were di&s;|played;
and honours flowed upon him from all quarters. He
was elected, in 1748, into the Royal Society of Stockholm, into
that of London in 1749, and in 1754 cho&s;en one of the eight
foreign members in the Academy of Sciences at Paris. In
1739 he was appointed phy&s;ician to George the Second, and
king's coun&s;ellor in 1740. In 1749 the emperor Francis con|ferred
on him letters of nobility at the reque&s;t of George the
Second; and about the &s;ame time the king, in a vi&s;it which
he had paid to the univer&s;ity, di&s;tingui&s;hed Haller with par|ticular
marks of approbation; an honour which the author
gratefully acknowledges, in an Engli&s;h publication, intitled,
&startq;A &s;hort Narrative of the King's Journey to Gottingen,&endq;
<PB N="38" REF="44">
and in the dedication to George the Second, prefixed to his
edition of Boerhaave's <HI>Methodus Studii Medici.</HI></P>
<P>HE declined, in 1745, an invitation to Oxford, which
would probably have terminated in his nomination to the
profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of botany, vacant by the death of the celebrated
Dillenius; a &s;econd from the univer&s;ity of Utrecht; and, in
1750, a third from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, with the offer of a
very con&s;iderable pen&s;ion. But of all his promotions, none
gave him more real &s;atisfaction, than his election into the
Great Council of Berne, as it en&s;ured to him a retreat ac|companied
with dignity, and probably with emolument, in
his native city, to which he looked forward with affection
and attachment.</P>
<P>AT length, in 1753, induced by the precarious &s;tate of his
health, by the de&s;ire of removing from Gottingen, which he
called the <HI>grave</HI> of his wives, and by his earne&s;t anxiety to
dedicate the remainder of his days to the &s;ervice of his coun|try,
he took a journey to Berne, in order to procure an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment,
which, though not adequate to his pre&s;ent ap|pointments,
might place him in the bo&s;om of his beloved
Switzerland. Soon after his arrival, he fortunately obtained
by lot the office of Amman: although this office was of &s;mall
emolument, yet, as it might be con&s;idered a prelude to future
appointments, and as it gave him an immediate opportunity
of &s;erving his children, he re&s;igned his profe&s;&s;or&s;hip at Got|tingen,
and &s;ettled at Berne. Such was the general joy of
his countrymen on this event, that Moriko&s;of &s;truck a medal
to commemorate his return.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="45">
HAVING formed this re&s;olution, he could not be &s;haken
by the mo&s;t &s;plendid offers. He declined, in 1755, the pre&s;|&s;ing
invitation of Frederic the Second, to &s;uperintend the
academies of Pru&s;&s;ia, and to accept the chancellor&s;hip of the
univer&s;ity of Hall, vacant by the death of Wolfe. In 1767,
he rejected the offer of a very advantageous and honourable
&s;ettlement at St. Peter&s;burgh, made by Catherine the Se|cond;
and, in 1770, the &s;till more dignified promotion to the
chancellor&s;hip of the univer&s;ity of Gottingen, with a very
con&s;iderable appointment; although George the Third
wrote not only to Haller, but to the Senate of Berne, reque&s;t|ing
their influence to per&s;uade his acceptance of it. His
grateful country rewarded this di&s;intere&s;ted attachment with
the mo&s;t liberal and unbounded confidence, and employed
his talents in the public &s;ervice. In 1757, he was &s;ent to re|form
the academy of Lau&s;anne; and, in the following year,
was deputed by the Senate to examine &s;ome curious remains
of antiquity lately di&s;covered at Culm. About the &s;ame
time he was appointed director of the &s;alt-works at Bex and
Aigle, with an annual &s;alary of &pound;. 500. During the term of
this appointment, which continued &s;ix years, he re&s;ided at
La Roche. In this retirement, he employed him&s;elf in &s;u|perintending
and improving the &s;alt-works, of which he has
given a &s;hort account; in making occa&s;ional excur&s;ions into
the neighbouring country, which he has likewi&s;e de&s;cribed;
but more particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed his retreat by preparing
and publi&s;hing his great work on phy&s;iology.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the amplitude and &s;ucce&s;s of Hal|ler's
labours in the various branches of medical knowledge,
<PB N="40" REF="46">
it was principally on phy&s;iology, which &s;eems to have been
his peculiar delight, that he di&s;played the whole force of his
genius, and founded his merit as an <HI>inventor</HI> in &s;cience.</P>
<P>HIS Outlines of Phy&s;iology, or <HI>Primae Lineae Phy&s;iologicae,</HI>
publi&s;hed at Gottingen in 1747, delineate the plan, and were
the prelude to his immortal work, which he mode&s;tly &s;tyles
<HI>Elements</HI> only, or <HI>Elementa Phy&s;iolygiae corporis humani,</HI> in
eight volumes in quarto, which &s;ucce&s;&s;ively made their ap|pearance
from 1757 to 1766. In conformity to Boerhaave's
plan, this part of the &s;cience of phy&s;ic is here emancipated
from theoretical &s;ubtlety, from metaphy&s;ical, mechanical,
and chymical hypothe&s;es, with which, for ages, it had been
incumbered; and was, for the fir&s;t time, built on the true ba&s;is
of anatomical knowledge. The exqui&s;ite knowledge which
he had di&s;played in relation to the &s;tructure of the human
body, his indefatigable re&s;earches into the facts and opi|nions
of all his predece&s;&s;ors, the judicious &s;election of them
to e&s;tabli&s;h his own, his &s;kill in comparative anatomy, the
extent of his di&s;coveries, and the application of the whole to
illu&s;trate the u&s;e of the parts in the human frame, afford
&s;uch an in&s;tance of learning, indu&s;try, penetration, and ge|nius,
as will undoubtedly tran&s;mit the author's name to po|&s;terity
among the greate&s;t contributors to u&s;eful knowledge.</P>
<P>ON his return to Berne he was elected member of the cham|ber
of appeal for the German di&s;trict, of the council of finan|ces,
of the committees for matrimonial affairs, and for im|proving
the &s;mall livings in the French di&s;trict of the can|ton:
he was al&s;o appointed perpetual a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Council
<PB N="41" REF="47">
of Health, with an annual &s;alary of about &pound;. 100, as a token
of his country's gratitude for having declined &s;o many &s;plen|did
offers from foreign courts, and for preferring his native
place to the advancement of his fortune.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e &s;everal offices he performed e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices to
the &s;tate, by promoting the mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;titutions, propo&s;|ing
nece&s;&s;ary alterations, and in framing new laws and ordi|nances.
In his capacity of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to the Chamber of Health, he
was particularly u&s;eful in forwarding the mo&s;t important re|gulations;
&s;uch as the prohibition of empirics, the recovery
of drowned per&s;ons, and the means to prevent the &s;preading
of the infectious di&s;temper then prevalent among the cattle
in various parts of Europe. He &s;hewed him&s;elf a friend to
humanity, by the zeal with which he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in obtaining
from government a public e&s;tabli&s;hment for orphans, by his
activity in providing it with a fund, and by drawing up the
plan. As a member of the Oeconomical Society, he laboured
much to improve the &s;tate of agriculture, and made many
experiments conducive to that end. In the meetings of the
Great Council he delivered, on important occa&s;ions, his opi|nion
with a manly freedom and lively eloquence, the re&s;ult
of the &s;ounde&s;t judgment and the mo&s;t feeling heart.</P>
<P>IN 1766, and the following years, this great man, who
had hitherto enlightened &s;cience from his clo&s;et, di&s;played in
the theatre of public life the more active and di&s;tingui&s;hed
parts of a patriot and politician. He re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the har|mony
and &s;ettled the di&s;putes between the Vallais and the
<PB N="42" REF="48">
canton of Berne by a &s;ucce&s;sful negociation, in which he
fixed the new boundaries of the two &s;tates; he was a&s;&s;ociated
with the mo&s;t enlightened characters of the republic in ter|minating
the di&s;&s;entions of Geneva; he drew up the princi|pal
di&s;patches to the court of Ver&s;ailles on the &s;ubject of the
changes which had been projected at Ver&s;oi, on which oc|ca&s;ion
he held a per&s;onal conference with the French amba&s;|&s;ador;
and was employed to prepare the plan of a treaty, which
the canton of Berne contracted with the Elector of Bavaria
relating to the purcha&s;e of &s;alt.</P>
<P>ON the conclu&s;ion of the&s;e public employments, Haller,
who had now attained the &s;ixty-&s;econd year of his age, with|drew
him&s;elf again from the bu&s;tle of life, and lived in a
more retired manner, fulfilling the duties of a father, a citi|zen,
and a magi&s;trate; and, although his health gradually
declined, yet his activity &s;till remained undimini&s;hed. He
re&s;umed his literary labours, which had been nece&s;&s;arily in|terrupted
amid&s;t his other more important avocations. He
publi&s;hed, in 1768, his hi&s;tory of Swi&s;s plants, mentioned
above; and, in 1771, the fir&s;t part of his <HI>Bibliotheca Medicinae</HI>
or his Medical Library.</P>
<P>No part of Haller's writings affords a more &s;triking ex|ample
of the value of early and per&s;evering indu&s;try, than
this publication. That habit which he had formed, &s;o early
as from the eighteenth year of his age, of noting his opinion
of books and authors, nece&s;&s;arily accumulated a con&s;iderable
ma&s;s of materials; and thus enabled him to turn them to
<PB N="43" REF="49">
very u&s;eful purpo&s;es. By the&s;e means the foundation of his
<HI>Medical Library</HI> was laid, even before he gave the improved
edition of Boerhaave's <HI>Methodus Studii Medici,</HI> in 1751.</P>
<P>BOERHAAVE u&s;ed to recommend to his &s;tudents the books
which they ought to con&s;ult on each &s;ubject: this catalogue
was, in 1726, &s;urreptitiou&s;ly and inaccurately printed, and
formed only a &s;mall volume in octavo; many nece&s;&s;ary ob|&s;ervations
were forgotten, and various authors both modern
and antient were omitted. Haller undertook to &s;upply the&s;e
deficiences; and extended the publication to two volumes in
quarto. In order to appreciate the merits of this compila|tion,
it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that various lexicons and ca|talogues
of medical authors were extant; but the writers had
merely given bare li&s;ts and titles, unaccompanied by that cri|tical
di&s;crimination of the de&s;ign, doctrine, and general merit
of each author, which rendered the&s;e volumes &s;o highly ac|ceptable.
In this manner Haller has given, under that cla&s;|&s;ical
method which Boerhaave had formed, his opinion of
more than 4, 000 volumes.</P>
<P>IN the pro&s;ecution of this plan, as it appears in his
own <HI>Bibliotheca,</HI> Haller traces the hi&s;tory of each branch of
medicine from its origin; and by following the hi&s;tory
of each in the &s;everal periods, has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
made his publication a compendious hi&s;tory of phy&s;ic. His
exten&s;ive acquaintance with antient and modern languages,
enabled him to comprehend a large field; and his indefa|tigable
indu&s;try, united to great penetration in inve&s;tigating
the doctrines of the antients, equally exhibits his erudition
<PB N="44" REF="50">
and that &s;ound judgment by which he has appreciated the
merit of tho&s;e &s;ages of phy&s;ic, in a manner highly intere&s;t|ing
and in&s;tructive. In his judgment of the moderns he is
candid and impartial; his great knowledge of his &s;ubjects
qualified him to di&s;tingui&s;h all original doctrines, new facts,
and ob&s;ervations, and to guard again&s;t &s;uch errors as might
mi&s;lead young and incautious practitioners; who are but too
apt to be influenced in their practice, by imbibed theories,
and prejudice towards particular authors.</P>
<P>HE has given additional value to his work, by annexing
to the account of celebrated books, &s;hort biographical anec|dotes
of the author. He mentions all the different editions,
that came to his knowledge, and particularly marks &s;uch as
were in his own library. And it is a matter of a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
that in this manner he notices and reviews not fewer
than 11,000 volumes. As the literary hi&s;tory of phy&s;ic was
among the favourite objects of Haller, this publication can|not
but be highly acceptable to &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;s a congenial ta&s;te;
while the general u&s;e and information they afford are &s;uffici|ently
obvious. Eight volumes of this work were publi&s;hed
between the years 1771 and 1778. The anatomical, including
the phy&s;iology, the botanical, and the chirurgical, were each
compri&s;ed in two volumes, and bring down the re&s;pective
&s;ubjects nearly to the pre&s;ent time. Two, on the practice of
phy&s;ic, were publi&s;hed by Haller, a third after his decea&s;e by
Dr. Tribolet, and a fourth by Dr. Brandis of Childen&s;heim,
from the manu&s;cript of Haller, which the learned author has
con&s;iderably augmented.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51">
HALLER employed the latter period of his life in &s;ending
extracts from eminent publications for the <HI>Bibliotheque Rai|&s;onnee;</HI>
furni&s;hed many of the articles for the &s;upplement to
the Paris Encyclop&eacute;die, for the quarto improved edition of
the &s;ame work publi&s;hed at Yverdun, and for the dictionary
of natural hi&s;tory printed at the &s;ame place. He meditated
al&s;o a new edition of his great phy&s;iological work, of which
he put forth the fir&s;t volume in 1777, only a few months
before his death.</P>
<P>HIS active imagination brooding on the civil and politi|cal
affairs, in which he had been lately engaged, produced,
between 1771 and 1774, his three political romances, U&s;ong,
Fabius and Cato, and Alfred, which treat of the de&s;potic, re|publican,
and monarchical forms of government. In U&s;ong
he &s;ketches, with a ma&s;terly hand, the abu&s;es of ab&s;olute
authority, and &s;ets forth, in the character of the principal
per&s;onage, the happy effects which may be derived from a
virtuous and intelligent &s;overeign, even amid&s;t the horrors
of oriental de&s;poti&s;m. In Fabius and Cato he de&s;cribes,
with an animation and &s;pirit worthy of antient Rome, but
with a partiality natural to a republican, the ari&s;tocratical
government as mo&s;t friendly to the di&s;play of patrioti&s;m,
and mo&s;t congenial to the exertions of genius. In the&s;e ro|mances
he di&s;covers $ound principles of legi&s;lation, great po|litical
&s;agacity, a deep in&s;ight into human nature, and a mo&s;t
exten&s;ive acquaintance with hi&s;tory. In Alfred he di&s;plays
the advantages of a limited monarchy, wherein the balance
of power is wi&s;ely di&s;tributed; and which, while it avoids
the extremes of either, enjoys the benefits of both.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="52">
WHEN we con&s;ider Haller as a man of piety and a Chri&s;|tian,
we ob&s;erve him tracing, from a comprehen&s;ive view
of the creation in its grande&s;t as well as in its minute&s;t parts,
the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> exi&s;tence of a Supreme Being, and the great
principles of natural religion. We &s;hall &s;ee him demon|&s;trating
the divine origin of Chri&s;tianity from a profound
&s;tudy of the New Te&s;tament, from the excellence of its
morality, its manife&s;t influence over the happine&s;s of man|kind,
and its tendency to meliorate our nature; and we
&s;hall find him proving him&s;elf, both in his life and writings,
a zealous friend and able advocate of the revealed doctrines.</P>
<P>HALLER, at a very early period of his life, undertook
the defence of natural and revealed religion on all occa&s;ions.
In 1732 he declared, in his preface to his poetry, that he was
firmly convinced of their truth; in 1747, he rejected with
horror the dedication which La Metrie offered to prefix to
his work entitled &startq;<HI>L'Homme Machine;</HI>&endq; and he declared,
in various literary journals, that he neither acknowledged as
his friend, or his di&s;ciple, a man who entertained &s;uch im|pious
notions. In a preface which he publi&s;hed in 1751, to
Formey's abridgement of Crouzas's &startq;<HI>Examen du Pyrrho|ni&s;me,</HI>&endq;
he paints, in the &s;tronge&s;t colours, the dreadful
effects of in&s;idelity both on &s;ociety and individuals. He put
forth, in the German tongue, &startq;Letters to his Daughter, on
the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Revelation;&endq; he publi&s;hed an
extract from Ditton's &startq;Truth of the Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t,&endq; which he acknowledges to have fir&s;t cleared any
doubts he might entertain on that &s;ubject. He avows, at
the &s;ame time, that he received infinite &s;atisfaction from the
<PB N="47" REF="53">
&s;tudy of the New Te&s;tament, becau&s;e he was never more
certain of holding conver&s;e with the Deity, than when he
read his <HI>will</HI> in that divine book.</P>
<P>IN 1775, he finally gave to the public, al&s;o in the German
language, &startq;Letters concerning &s;everal late Attempts of
Freethinkers yet living again&s;t Revelation.&endq; In this work the
author examines and refutes the objections to Chri&s;tianity,
advanced in &s;o lively and dangerous a manner by Voltaire in
his <HI>Que&s;tions &s;ur l'Encyclopedie.</HI> &startq;If this latter publication,&endq;
adds Sennebier, &startq;may be con&s;idered as an Index to the
Doubts and Arguments again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Religion, the
work of Haller may be entitled an Index to the An&s;wers in
favour of the &s;ame Revelation, to be con&s;ulted by tho&s;e
who wi&s;h impartially to di&s;cu&s;s both &s;ides of this important
que&s;tion.&endq; When learning and philo&s;ophy, in&s;tead of being
employed in &s;upporting &s;ceptical tenets by artful &s;ophi&s;try,
thus lend their united a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the cau&s;e of religion,
they truly become an honour to the profe&s;&s;or, and a benefit
to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT even this great and good man was not exempt from
a too anxious &s;olicitude for his welfare in a future &s;tate.
That depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, which ought ju&s;tly to be con&s;idered
as the effects of di&s;ea&s;e, and the warmth of his imagination
con&s;piring perhaps with the narrow principles of Calvini&s;m,
in which he had been educated, led him to reflect rather on
the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> than the <HI>mercy</HI> of the Deity, and to bewilder
him&s;elf in the endle&s;s mazes of prede&s;tination and grace.
<PB N="48" REF="54">
In one of his de&s;ponding fits, he compared him&s;elf, as un|certain
of &s;alvation, to a man placed on the edge of a precipice
without any &s;upport, and expecting every in&s;tant to fall.
At another moment, animated with a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;cience,
he breaks out, in a letter to his friend Bonnet, into an ex|clamation,
expre&s;&s;ive of his regret to quit a world which he
had improved by his di&s;coveries, and which he might &s;till
further illuminate by his zeal and application. &startq;O my poor
brain, which mu&s;t return to du&s;t; and all the knowledge
and information which I have been collecting with &s;uch un|wearied
labour, will <HI>fade away</HI> like the dream of an infant.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE little weakne&s;&s;es of a great mind overpowered
by con&s;titutional irritability, and &s;truggling again&s;t early pre|judices,
are more intere&s;ting to the man who feels and re|&s;pects
the imperfections of human nature, even in its mo&s;t
exalted &s;tate, than the mo&s;t pompous and exaggerated ac|counts
of <HI>unerring</HI> wi&s;dom, or <HI>uniform</HI> virtue which never
exi&s;ted. It is, however, a plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction to learn, that
rea&s;on and religion ro&s;e &s;uperior to the gloomy de&s;pondency
of &s;ickne&s;s; and that Haller met death with the calmne&s;s of
a philo&s;opher, and the faith of a Chri&s;tian. In the la&s;t letter
which he wrote, a few days before his decea&s;e, he &s;peaks
indeed of the tremendous grandeur of eternity, but with
hopes rather than with fears; and looks back upon his pa&s;t
life with &s;atisfaction: amid&s;t a few complaints uttered on
his painful &s;ufferings, he mentions his country with the mo&s;t
ardent affection, and offers up his la&s;t prayers for its pre|&s;ervation
and welfare.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="55">
HE continued his literary labours, and pre&s;erved his
&s;en&s;es and compo&s;ure to the la&s;t moment; he beheld his
end approaching without fear and regret; &startq;My friend,&endq; &s;aid
he to the phy&s;ician who attended him, &startq;I die, my pul&s;e is
&s;topped,&endq; and then expired. He expired on the 12th of De|cember
1777, in the &s;eventieth year of his age.&mdash;Thus lived,
and thus died, the great Haller; a man to whom Michaelis,
the eminent orientali&s;t, ju&s;tly applies an ob&s;ervation which
had been made on the genius of Ari&s;totle; &startq;<HI>Neque caelo,
neque terr&acirc;, neque mari quicquam relinquere voluit incogni|tum,
indole praeterea adeo mirabili, ut ad &s;ingula natum
praecipu&egrave; dicas</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He left nothing unexplored, either in the heavens, on the earth, or in the &s;ea, and was of &s;uch wonderful capacity, that he &s;eemed born for the immediate object of his pur&s;uit.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>IN his per&s;on Haller was tall and maje&s;tic, of a &s;erious
and expre&s;&s;ive countenance; he had at times an open &s;mile,
always a plea&s;ing tone of voice, u&s;ually low, and &s;eldom
elevated, even when he was mo&s;t agitated. He was fond of
unbending him&s;elf in &s;ociety, was on tho&s;e occa&s;ions re|markably
cheerful, polite, and attentive; he would con|ver&s;e
with the ladies on fa&s;hions, modes of dre&s;s, and other
trifles, with as much ea&s;e as if he had never &s;ecluded him|&s;elf
from the world.</P>
<P>MR. BONNET informed me, that Haller wrote with equal
facility the German, French, and Latin tongues; that he was
&s;o well acquainted with all the European languages, except
the Ru&s;&s;ian, Poli&s;h, and Hungarian, as to &s;peak with the
<PB N="50" REF="56">
natives in their re&s;pective idioms. When he conver&s;ed on
any topic of literature, his knowledge was &s;o exten&s;ive, that
he &s;eemed to have made that &s;ubject his particular &s;tudy.
His profound erudition in every branch of &s;cience, is well
known to all who are conver&s;ant with his works: but the
variety of his information, and the ver&s;atility of his talents,
are delineated by a per&s;on<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">T$charner Lobrede, &amp;c. p. 87.</NOTE> who was his particular friend.
&startq;He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fundamental knowledge of natural hi&s;tory;
was well read in hi&s;tory both antient and modern, univer&s;al
and particular; and uncommonly ver&s;ed in the &s;tate of agri|culture,
manufactures, trade, population, literature, and
languages of the re&s;pective nations of Europe: he had read
with attention the mo&s;t remarkable voyages and travels; and
was particularly conver&s;ant in the late di&s;coveries which
tend to illu&s;trate the geography of the globe. He had even
peru&s;ed many thou&s;and novels and plays; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
&s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing memory, that he could detail their con|tents
with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>As it was his cu&s;tom to make extracts, and to give his
opinion of every book which came into his hands, as well
for his own private u&s;e, as for the Gottingen Review<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Haller reviewed, as his department for that literary journal, all publications on hi&s;tory, medicine, anatomy, natural hi&s;tory, and &s;everal mi&s;cellaneous works, particularly tho&s;e which appeared in Italy.</NOTE>,
he read mo&s;t new publications, and &s;o eager was he u&s;ually
in the peru&s;al, that he laid them upon the table even when
he was at dinner, occa&s;ionally looking into them, and mark|ing
tho&s;e parts with a pencil, which he afterwards extracted
<PB N="51" REF="57">
or commented upon. He was accu&s;tomed to make his re|marks
on &s;mall pieces of paper, of different &s;izes, which he
placed in order, and fa&s;tened together: a method he learned
from Leibnitz.</P>
<P>HE derived from nature extreme &s;en&s;ibility, or rather
irritability of temper, which is ever the child of genius. He
&s;poke therefore from his own experience, when, in a letter
to Voltaire he thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf:&mdash;&startq;Providence holds
with an equal hand the balance of human happine&s;s. He
has loaded you with riches, he has loaded you with glory;
but misfortune was nece&s;&s;ary, and he pre&s;erved the equili|brium
by giving you &s;en&s;ibility. If my wi&s;hes could take
effect, I would be&s;tow upon you that <HI>tranquillity</HI> which
flies at the approach of genius, which is inferior to genius
in relation to &s;ociety, but far &s;uperior in regard to our&s;elves:
then the mo&s;t celebrated man in Europe &s;hould be at the
&s;ame time the mo&s;t happy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Il faut bien que la providence veuille tenir la balance &eacute;gale pour tous les humains. Elle vous a combl&eacute; de biens, elle vous a combl&eacute; de gloire; mais il vous &s;alloit du malheur, elle a trouv&eacute; l'&eacute;quilibre en vous rendant &s;en&s;ible.&mdash;Si les &s;ouhaits avoient du pouvoir, j'ajou|terois aux bien&s;aits du de&s;tin; je vous don|nerois de la tranquillit&eacute;, qui fuit devant le genie, qui ne le vaut pas par rapport &agrave; la &s;oci$t&eacute; mais qui vaut bien davantage par rapport &agrave; nous-m&ecirc;me: des-lors l'homme le plus c&eacute;l&eacute;bre de l'Europe &s;eroit au&s;&s;i le plus heu|reux.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>HE was always impatient under &s;ickne&s;s as well from
his extreme &s;u&s;ceptibility of pain, as becau&s;e he was pre|cluded
in that &s;ituation from his literary occupations. He
was fond, therefore, of taking violent remedies, more cal|culated
to remove the immediate effects of pain, and to
<PB N="52" REF="58">
check his di&s;order, than to cure it radically. In his latter
years he accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to opium<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Zimmerman informs us, that he took daily &s;o large a quantity as eight grains. U$ber die Ein&s;amkeit, p. 216. ed. Leip&s;. 1784.</NOTE>, which, operating
as a temporary palliative, only increa&s;ed his natural im|patience.
This re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of temper, which occa&s;ionally
di&s;turbed his tranquillity even in his younger days, and in
the full flow of his health and &s;pirits, was con&s;iderably height|ened
by the advances of age, and the di&s;orders which
&s;hattered his frame towards the clo&s;e of his days.</P>
<P>HIS corre&s;pondence in every period of his life was ex|ten&s;ive,
punctual, and carried on in the Engli&s;h, French,
German, Latin, and Italian languages. Six volumes of Latin
epi&s;tles, and three in the German tongue, addre&s;&s;ed to him
from men of learning in various parts of Europe, have
been given to the public, but his own have never made their
appearance. It is much to be lamented, that he &s;eldom
pre&s;erved any copies, being him&s;elf too much occupied for
that purpo&s;e; and never &s;ufficiently rich to maintain a &s;ecre|tary.
His two principal corre&s;pondents, to whom he opened
his heart, were Bonnet of Geneva, and John Ge&s;ner of
Zuric: to the latter he wrote either in German or Latin,
to Mr. Bonnet in the French tongue. This celebrated friend
of Haller po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;even manu&s;cript volumes of his letters:
it was an uninterrupted corre&s;pondence of twenty-three
years; begun in March 1754, and fini&s;hing only a few days
before his death, in December 1777. This epi&s;tolary com|merce
comprehends a great variety of &s;ubjects, principally
concerning phy&s;iology, natural hi&s;tory, the &s;tructure of the
<PB N="53" REF="59">
globe, politics, morality and religion. Haller being ac|cu&s;tomed
to con&s;ult his friend on all occa&s;ions, to di&s;clo&s;e
his mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts, and to relate his diurnal occupa|tions;
the&s;e effu&s;ions of the moment di&s;cover the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
train of his &s;tudies, the progre&s;s of his di&s;coveries, and his
gradual advances in knowledge.</P>
<P>&startq;THESE letters of my mo&s;t re&s;pectable friend,&endq; added
Bonnet, &startq;di&s;play his genius, his under&s;tanding, and the
goodne&s;s of his heart, more fully than any of his publica|tions.
His &s;tyle, conci&s;e, energetic yet picture&s;que, corre|&s;ponds
with the &s;trength and originality of his ideas; and he
&s;peaks, with no le&s;s &s;ublimity than conviction, of the great
truths of natural and revealed religion. Though he treats
the numerous advocates for infidelity, and particularly
Voltaire, with &s;ufficient &s;everity; yet his heat is the ardour
of conviction, and did not proceed from either pique or
&s;pirit of contradiction: he &s;eemed as if he was per&s;onally
intere&s;ted in all que&s;tions on revelation, and pleaded its cau&s;e
as if it had been his own. He is no le&s;s &s;evere again&s;t tho&s;e
writers, who &s;eem to exclude the intervention of a fir&s;t in|tellectual
cau&s;e in the creation and arrangement of the
univer&s;e, and particularly cen&s;ures the materiali&s;ts, who
endeavour to deduce mechanically the formation of organized
bodies. In a word, his philo&s;ophy was entirely practical,
becau&s;e it was entirely Chri&s;tian; and nothing &s;ecured his
approbation, but what tended to improve the under&s;tanding,
or to amend the heart.&endq; I am concerned to find, that the
publication of this corre&s;pondence, between two &s;uch en|lightened
and virtuous philo&s;ophers as Haller and Bonnet,
<PB N="54" REF="60">
which in &s;ome works had been announced to the public,
&s;hould, on account of private rea&s;ons, be relinqui&s;hed.
Religion, morality, philo&s;ophy, and learning, would be
greatly benefited by this epi&s;tolary commerce.</P>
<P>HALLER'S library, con&s;i&s;ting of about 4, 000 volumes,
was purcha&s;ed for &pound;. 2, 000 by the emperor, for the public
library of Milan, where I examined it in 1785. The col|lection
is particularly rich in books of natural hi&s;tory, and
is rendered invaluable from numerous annotations of Haller,
written on the margins.</P>
<P>HALLER was three times married, fir&s;t to Marianne
Wyt&s;en, in 1731, who died in 1736. 2. To Elizabeth
Buchers, in 1738, who died in childbed the &s;ame or the
following year; both natives of Berne. 3. In 1739, to
Amelia Frederica Teichmeyer, a German lady, who &s;ur|vived
him. He has written and publi&s;hed the lives of his
two fir&s;t wives. He left eight children, four &s;ons and four
daughters, all of whom he lived to &s;ee e&s;tabli&s;hed. His
elde&s;t Gotlieb Emanuel, who was born in 1735, followed
his father's example in dedicating him&s;elf to the &s;ervice
of his country, and to the pur&s;uits of literature. He
was elected member of the Great Council, and obtained
various employments under government, particularly the
bailliage of Nyon, in which &s;ituation he died in 1786. He
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as an author by various publications
tending to illu&s;trate the hi&s;tory and literature of Switzer|land,
and particularly by his <HI>Schweilzer-bibliothek,</HI> or Swi&s;s
Library, in &s;ix volumes 8vo. of which he lived to publi&s;h
<PB N="55" REF="61">
only the fir&s;t. In this work, de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed for its
method and accuracy, the indefatigable author enumerates
all the books which treat of Switzerland, in all languages,
and all the works publi&s;hed by the Swi&s;s on all &s;ubjects.
He even de&s;cends to the minute&s;t articles which have ap|peared
in reviews and journals; and in mo&s;t in&s;tances,
where the publication de&s;erves detail, analy&s;es the contents,
corrects the errors, and gives his opinion on the merits of
the performance. I was per&s;onally acquainted with the
learned author, and am indebted to him for &s;ome curious
information on Switzerland, and for &s;everal anecdotes re|lative
to his illu&s;trious father, which I have introduced

<HEAD>LETTER 58.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MR. SPRUNGLI'S COLLECTION OF SWISS BIRDS&mdash;OF
THE BEARDED VULTURE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. SPRUNGLI'S cabinet of natural hi&s;tory, is remark|able
for the collection of &s;tuffed birds, both local
and migratory, that are found in Switzerland. In 1776 this
collection con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred &s;pecimens; and when I
la&s;t vi&s;ited Berne, in 1786, it had received an addition of fifty
&s;pecies. As naturali&s;ts have long expected with impatience
an account of this invaluable collection, I obtained from Mr.
Sprungli the enclo&s;ed catalogue, which will a&s;&s;i&s;t me in at|tempting
to form a <HI>Faunula Helvetica</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the end of this volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t remarkable birds in Mr. Sprungli's col|lection,
is the <HI>vultur barbatus</HI> of Linnaeus, the <HI>vultur aureus</HI>
of Ge&s;ner, or bearded vulture of the Engli&s;h ornithologi&s;ts.
As many fabulous tales have been related concerning its un|common
&s;trength and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s; as great confu&s;ion has
ari&s;en from the variety of names applied by different natu|rali&s;ts
to the &s;ame bird; and as &s;ome travellers have doubted
whether this &s;pecimen is the large vulture of the Alps, or
the golden vulture of Conrad Ge&s;ner; I &s;hall therefore &s;ub|join
a de&s;cription from particulars principally communicated
to me by Mr. Sprungli him&s;elf, accompanied with a draw|ing
<PB REF="63">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="57" REF="64">
of the head from the natural &s;ize. This &s;pecimen was a
female bird, caught in the canton of Glarus; it mea&s;ured
from the tip of the beak to the extremity of the tail, &s;ix feet
&s;ix inches French<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Six feet eleven inches&punc; Engli&s;h, and eight feet &s;ix inches $15.</NOTE> mea&s;ure; and eight feet from the tip of
one wing to that of the other expanded. It weighed, when
fir&s;t taken, eleven pounds. This bird, though always called
a vulture, yet differs from that genus, and is referable to the
eagle, in having the head and neck covered with feathers;
whereas one of the di&s;tinctions of the vulture, according to
Linnaeus, is that the head is de&s;titute of feathers. Notwith|&s;tanding
this di&s;tingui&s;hing mark, by which it is referable
to the eagle or <HI>falco</HI> genus; yet Linnaeus was probably in|duced
to cla&s;s it with the vultures, from the general form of
the body, and &s;hape of the beak, which is the <HI>fir&s;t e&s;&s;ential</HI>
characteri&s;tic in the genera of birds.</P>
<P>MR. SPRUNGLI, however, is of opinion, that it might be
cla&s;&s;ed between the vulture and the eagle; and Stor<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Stor's Alpen Rei&s;in, vol. i.</NOTE> pro|po&s;es
to form a new genus of it, under the name of GYPAE|TUS,
by the following characters:
<Q><L>Ro&s;trum rectum, ba&s;i cera in&s;tructum &s;etis porrectis con&s;er|ti&s;&s;imis
barbatum; apice auctum unco &s;ulcato.</L>
<L>Caput pennis tectum.</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;pecific character he would define thus:
<Q>Gypaetus (grandis) albido-rutilus dor&s;o fu&s;cus, taenia nigra
&s;upra et infra oculos.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="65">
IT inhabits the highe&s;t parts of the great chain of the
Alps which &s;eparates Switzerland from Italy, makes its ne&s;t
in clefts of rocks inacce&s;&s;ible to man, and u&s;ually produces
three young ones at a time, &s;ometimes four, if we may judge
from that number accompanying the old birds, when they
de&s;cend into the lower regions for prey. They live on ani|mals
which inhabit the Alps, &s;uch as the chamois, white
hares, marmots, &s;now hens, kids, and particularly lambs,
from which circum&s;tance it is called <HI>lammer-geyer,</HI> or <HI>lamb</HI>
vulture. If common report may be credited, this rapacious
creature &s;ometimes attacks even man, and carries off chil|dren.
Mr. Sprungli, without ab&s;olutely denying the po&s;&s;ibi|lity
of this account, has, notwith&s;tanding all his re&s;earches,
never been able to a&s;certain a well-authenticated in&s;tance;
and thence rather concludes it to be a fable invented by the
pea&s;ants to frighten their children. This &s;pecies does not
appear but in &s;mall companies, u&s;ually con&s;i&s;ting of the two
old birds and their young.</P>
<P>CONARD GESNER has given a &s;hort but accurate de&s;crip|tion
of this bird under the name of <HI>vultur aureus,</HI> or
goldgeyer<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Hi&s;t. Avium, edit. Frank. <HI>p.</HI> 710.</NOTE>; and an engraving from a &s;kin &s;ent to him
from the Gri&s;ons. This figure, although rudely executed,
yet exhibits with &s;ufficient accuracy the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racters
of the &s;pecies and genus, &s;uch as the configura|tion
of the beak, the legs feathered down to the claws, and
particularly the beard. In fine, a compari&s;on with the &s;pe|cimen
in Mr. Sprungli's collection evidently proves that it is
<PB N="59" REF="66">
the &s;ame bird. Since this great naturali&s;t, no other per&s;on
&s;eems to have de&s;cribed it from nature, except Edwards,
under the denomination of the bearded vulture. The de|&s;cription
of that bird, and the engraving given by Edwards<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See tab. 106. of his Hi&s;tory.</NOTE>
from a &s;pecimen &s;ent from Santa Cruz in Barbary, corre|&s;pond
exactly with the <HI>vultur barbatus</HI> of Sprungli; and the
head, if compared with the drawing annexed to this account,
will be found to an&s;wer &s;ufficiently.</P>
<P>MR. SPRUNGLI favoured me with the following remarks,
in an&s;wer to tho&s;e travellers who a&s;&s;ert, that his &s;pecimen is
not the large vulture of the Alps, &s;ometimes called, from its
<HI>yellowi&s;h</HI> plumage, the <HI>vautour jaune,</HI> but a &s;maller &s;pecies;
becau&s;e the larger &s;ort mea&s;ures &s;ometimes fourteen feet, or
more, from the tip of one wing to that of the other. He
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es two &s;pecimens of this bird; the one a full grown
female, from which my de&s;cription and drawing are taken,
mea&s;uring eight French feet: the other is a male, but young,
and is &s;omewhat le&s;s. He has al&s;o examined four &s;pecimens,
none of which mea&s;ured more than nine feet; but as the&s;e
&s;everal &s;pecimens were not full grown males, he is ready to
allow, that an in&s;tance or two may po&s;&s;ibly have occurred,
in which this bird may have mea&s;ured near twelve feet from
tip to tip of the wing. Tho&s;e who give it a greater expan|&s;ion,
have derived their information either from per&s;ons who
were not naturali&s;ts, or from uncertain and exaggerated re|ports.
The &s;ame remark may al&s;o be applied to the fabu|lous
&s;tories recorded by the pea&s;ants, concerning its wonder|ful
<PB N="60" REF="67">
&s;trength as well as &s;ize. It is likewi&s;e to be ob&s;erved,
that the pea&s;ants do not confine the name of <HI>lammer-geyer</HI>
to this &s;pecies; but extend it indi&s;criminately to &s;everal large
birds of prey, from whence has ari&s;en great confu&s;ion of
names, and much uncertainty in the accounts of this bird.</P>
<P>SOME ornithologi&s;ts &s;eemed to have formed of it &s;everal
&s;pecies, which on compari&s;on will appear to be the &s;ame, or
only varieties of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Thus the bearded vulture,
the cinereous vulture, and the fulvous vulture, which Mr. La|tham
has de&s;cribed as three different &s;pecies, are probably
the &s;ame bird as that in Mr. Sprungli's collection. Of the
fir&s;t there can be no doubt, &s;ince Mr. Latham refers to the
bearded vulture of Edwards, which I have &s;hewn to be that
of Mr. Sprungli. The cinereous vulture is de&s;cribed by La|tham
after Bri&s;&s;on: &startq;Beneath the throat hangs a kind of
beard, compo&s;ed of very narrow feathers like hairs; legs
covered with feathers quite to the toes, which are yellow;
claws black<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Syn. <HI>vol.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 14.</NOTE>.&endq; This de&s;cription accords with the bird in
que&s;tion, and particularly in the beard, which is the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
characteri&s;tic. The fulvous vulture of Latham is
the griffin of Buffon: and the French naturali&s;t doubts whe|ther
it is not a variety of Ge&s;ner's golden vulture, which is
proved to be the &s;ame as Mr. Sprungli's &s;pecimen.</P>
<P>WHILE the mo&s;t celebrated ornithologi&s;ts have thus given
to the bird different names, they have al&s;o in other in&s;tances
confounded it with other birds, to which it has no other re|&s;emblance
<PB N="61" REF="68">
than that of &s;ize, &s;trength, and voracity. Thus
Buffon erroneou&s;ly conjectures the <HI>vultur gryphus</HI> of Lin|naeus,
or the <HI>condor</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr Latham, in his &s;upplement to the General Synop&s;is of Birds, p. 1. &s;eems al&s;o to adopt the conjecture of Buffon, in cla&s;&s;ing the Lammer-geyer and Condor under the &s;ame &s;pecies; though he confe&s;&s;es, &startq;that it &s;till remains dubious, whether the Lammer|geyer be the &s;ame with the Condor, or a mere variety of the Bearded Vulture&endq; He adds al&s;o, with a candour which does him honour, &startq;It is much to be feared, that other authors, as well as my&s;elf, have greatly confounded the &s;pecies of Vultures; for being like the Falcon tribe, long lived, their plumage puts on a great variety of dre&s;s, &s;uf|ficient to deceive tho&s;e who have hitherto at|tempted to di&s;criminate them.&endq;</NOTE> of America, to be the &s;ame as the <HI>lam|mer-geyer,</HI>
or vulture of the Alps; whereas the de&s;cription
of the condor given by Linnaeus, as well as by tho&s;e who had
&s;een it, differs entirely from that of the bearded vulture.
The condor is de&s;cribed by the Swede as having &startq;the head
de&s;titute of feathers, but covered with a &s;light brown co|loured
down, with a comb reaching along the top of the
head, and having the throat naked and of a reddi&s;h colour.&endq;
Frezier, in his Voyage to the South Seas, al&s;o thus de&s;cribes
the condor:&mdash;&startq;We one day killed a bird of prey called a
condor, which was nine feet from the end of one wing to
the end of the other, and had a brown comb or cre&s;t, but
not jagged like a cock's: the fore part of its throat is red
without feathers, like a turkey; and they are generally large
and &s;trong enough to take up a lamb. In order to get them
from the flock, they draw them&s;elves into a circle, and ad|vance
towards them with their wings extended, that being
drove together, and too clo&s;e, they may not be able to de|fend
them&s;elves; then they pick them out and carry them
off. Garcila&s;&s;o &s;ays, there are &s;ome in Peru &s;ixteen feet from
<PB N="62" REF="69">
the point of one wing to the other, and that a certain nation
of Indians adored them.&endq;</P>
<P>MR. LATHAM &s;eems al&s;o to be no le&s;s mi&s;taken, when, on
the authority of the tran&s;lator of the Abb&egrave; Fortis's Travels into
Dalmatia, he conceives the <HI>vultur percnopterus</HI> of Linnaeus
to be the <HI>vautour des Alpes</HI> de&s;cribed by Conrad Ge&s;ner, and
the &s;ame as Mr. Sprungli's &s;pecimen; whereas, on the au|thority
of Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t, who &s;aw great numbers of the <HI>per|cnopteri</HI>
in Egypt, the head of that bird is &startq;naked and
wrinkled,&endq; and Ray &s;ays, the feet are naked; two characters
that e&s;&s;entially di&s;tingui&s;h it from the bearded vulture, in
which the head is wholly covered with feathers, and al&s;o
the feet down to the ends of the claws.</P>
<P>THE bearded vulture, be&s;ides inhabiting tho&s;e Alps
which &s;eparate Italy from Switzerland, is found in Cor&s;ica
and Sardinia. M. de Hahn informed Mr. Sprungli, that he
&s;aw a bird in Cor&s;ica which was wounded in the wing, and
&s;hewed as a &s;ight, that was unque&s;tionably the &s;ame as Mr.
Sprungli's &s;tuffed &s;pecimen: and M. Lettel, in his Natural
Hi&s;tory of Sardinia, gives a figure and de&s;cription of the
&s;ame bird, under the name of <HI>bartgeyer,</HI> or bearded vulture.
It has al&s;o been found in the mountains of Africa, &s;ince Mr.
Edwards received his &s;pecimen from Santa Cruz in Barbary.

and which he ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pects to be the <HI>cornix cornubiae,</HI> or the
red-legged crow. The <HI>pyrrhocorax</HI> of Ge&s;ner, which &s;ome

<HI>corvus pyrrhocorax.</HI> Both the&s;e &s;pecies inhabit the Alps,
but the pyrrhocorax is the mo&s;t common; and the&s;e appear,
according to Mr. Sprungli's ob&s;ervations, to be the only &s;pe|cies
of the crow genus that prefer to all others alpine &s;itua|tions.
As to the <HI>corvus eremita</HI> of Linnaeus, Mr. Sprungli
<PB N="64" REF="71">
acknowledges it is totally unknown to him. All the orni|thologi&s;ts
indeed mention this bird as an inhabitant of the
Alps, on the authority of Conrad Ge&s;ner, who de&s;cribes it
under the name of <HI>corvus &s;ylvaticus,</HI> accompanied with a
figure, which has not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to a crow, but
rather to a curlew; yet Ge&s;ner's de&s;cription of it is much too
imperfect to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in a&s;certaining the bird of which he

<HEAD>LETTER 59.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MR. WYTTENBACH'S COLLECTION&mdash;ACCOUNT OF
THE CHAIN OF HILLS AND ALPS SEEN FROM
THE ENVIRONS OF BERNE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reverend Mr. Wyttenbach of Berne, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a
very curious cabinet, principally relating to the natu|ral
hi&s;tory of Switzerland, and of the canton of Berne in par|ticular.
It contains &s;pecimens of &s;everal thou&s;and plants,
among which is a large number of the alpine plants of Swit|zerland;
and he has already began to arrange &s;eparately the
cap&s;ules, &s;eeds, and fruits. It is &s;till more intere&s;ting for the
great variety of fo&s;&s;ils, &s;tones, and petrifactions collected by
him&s;elf in the neighbourhood of Berne, and from the upper
and lower Alps. Mr. Wyttenbach al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es various
&s;hells, in&s;ects, and numerous drawings of the glaciers and
upper alps, which cannot fail of being highly plea&s;ing to the
curious traveller.</P>
<P>BUT I was mo&s;t &s;truck with that part of his cabinet, com|prehending
tho&s;e objects of natural hi&s;tory, which in any de|gree
influence agriculture, phy&s;ic, arts and trades; and which
&s;ufficiently prove the utility of that &s;cience in the progre&s;s and
improvement of human comfort and knowledge. On this
&s;ubject he has already publi&s;hed a di&s;&s;ertation in the Acts of
the Oeconomical Society at Berne. He has not formed this
<PB N="66" REF="73">
ample collection from mere motives of curio&s;ity, or from de|&s;ultory
views, but with a &s;ettled intention to illu&s;trate the
natural hi&s;tory of Switzerland in general; to form a topo|graphical
and mineralogical de&s;cription of the canton of Berne
in particular; and to elucidate the original formation of
mountains, which is the favourite object of his re&s;earches,
and which his frequent vi&s;its to the Alps will a&s;&s;i&s;t him in
executing with fidelity and accuracy.</P>
<P>AT my reque&s;t, this indefatigable ob&s;erver favoured me
with a plan and de&s;cription of that range of alps which is
&s;een from Berne, and of the intervening di&s;trict; an extract
from which I now &s;ubmit to your peru&s;al.</P>
<P>THAT part of the chain of alps &s;een from Berne, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the different names of Wetterhorn, Schreckhorn,
Eger, Jungfrauhorn, Lauter-Aar-Horn, Blumlis Alp, &amp;c. is
repre&s;ented on the plan annexed to this letter. You will
there ob&s;erve this immen&s;e amphitheatre, gradually ri&s;ing
from the environs of Berne, to tho&s;e elevated peaks, covered
with eternal &s;now, and hitherto inacce&s;&s;ible. The plains
and hills between Berne and Thun are compo&s;ed of rounded
&s;tones, and argillaceous &s;tones called <HI>mola&s;&s;es,</HI> frequently
ranged in alternate &s;trata. The <HI>mola&s;&s;e</HI> at Gurten, about
two miles from Berne, contains, though rarely, gla&s;&s;opetrae;
and the &s;trata of Belpberg, about &s;even or eight miles from
the capital, are full of different &s;pecies of chamites, o&s;tracites,
globo&s;ites, &s;elenites, &s;trombites, and other &s;imilar petrifac|tions.
The ridge of hills which border the high road be|tween
Berne and Thun contains, in &s;everal places, and par|ticularly
<PB REF="74">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="67" REF="75">
above Mu&s;ingen, an exten&s;ive &s;tratum of o&s;tracites,
&s;ome pieces of which weigh more than fifteen pounds each.
The &s;ituation of the &s;trata in the&s;e different hills, their direc|tion,
their nature, and the bodies which they enclo&s;e, &s;eem
to prove, that the&s;e hills formed antiently one great plain,
which has been &s;ince hollowed and divided by the waters,
particularly by tho&s;e of the Aar.</P>
<P>ON the &s;lopes and &s;ummits of the&s;e hills, which in &s;ome
places are of con&s;iderable elevation, are frequently found
tho&s;e large ma&s;&s;es of granite, which furni&s;h materials for
the public works and buildings of Berne. The&s;e ma&s;&s;es &s;o
nearly re&s;emble the granite of the Grim&s;el, and of the
mountains which compo&s;e the great central chain of the
alps, as to render it probable, that in the antient revolutions
of this globe, they have been brought by the waters to the
places where they are at pre&s;ent found, before the deep val|lies,
which now &s;eparate them from their original moun|tains,
exi&s;ted. The &s;ame remark may be as ju&s;tly applied to
the blocks of marble and other calcareous &s;tones, which,
though now removed to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from their
native &s;ituation, are al&s;o di&s;covered in large quantities upon
the hills adjacent to Berne, and which likewi&s;e &s;erve for the
buildings of that capital.</P>
<P>As we approach the town and lake of Thun, the view
opens and di&s;covers, towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t, that high calca|reous
chain, of which the Stockhorn, the Neuneren, and the
Ganteri&s;h have been illu&s;trated by the botanical labours of
the celebrated Haller. This chain, which joins that of
<PB N="68" REF="76">
Schwartzenburgh towards the canton of Friburgh, is chiefly
calcareous, and contains fewer petrifactions than the above|mentioned
hills: it is not of &s;ufficient elevation to be co|vered
with &s;now in &s;ummer. The Nie&s;s, which is the la&s;t
mountain in this calcareous chain, &s;tands on the borders of
the lake; and &s;eparates the valley of Frutingen from that
of Simme. It is peculiarly intere&s;ting to travellers, on ac|count
of the fine view from its &s;ummit; and to naturali&s;ts,
becau&s;e it joins to the alps. Towards its foot beds of &s;late
have been di&s;covered; higher up it is of calcareous &s;tone;
and near its top is found a &s;pecies of pudding-&s;tone, filled
with &s;mall fragments of broken petrifactions.</P>
<P>IN traver&s;ing the lake of Thun, its borders, which are
planted with vines, are compo&s;ed of rounded &s;tones, united
by a calcareous cement, as far as the mountains of St. Beat.
There, near Rallingen, the rocks are calcareous and rugged,
containing, in a few places, broken petrifactions, of which it
is often difficult to a&s;certain the &s;pecies. On continuing my
route at the foot of the St. Beat, I ob&s;erved the fir&s;t rocks,
that are ab&s;olutely perpendicular, and even impending, and
which are marked at different elevations with furrows, occa|&s;ioned
by the waters of the lake, that, in former periods,
was probably &s;everal hundred feet above its pre&s;ent level.
I remarked the &s;ame furrows nearly at the &s;ame elevations,
in the vallies of Lauterbrunnen and Ha&s;li, which coinci|dence
&s;eems to prove, that the lake of Thun once extended
over all the&s;e parts, covered the whole plain of Berne, and
reached as high as the Lengenberg, where Gruner di&s;co|vered
tho&s;e petrifactions called Pholades.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="77">
HAVING traver&s;ed the lake of Thun, I entered the nar|row
but agreeable valley of Unter&s;even and Interlachen, on
each &s;ide of which the mountains approach each other,
and form, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, the <HI>ve&s;tibule</HI> of the
alps. This valley, &s;eparating the lakes of Thun and Brientz,
which appear to have been once united, is entirely formed
by the &s;tones which torrents have brought from the alps.
On the right is Abendberg covered with trees and herbage, and
&s;tretching towards a group of mountains of con&s;iderable ex|tent;
yet little known, though their tops may be &s;een at
Berne. The Ballenhoech&s;t, Sulek, Schnabelhorn, Schwartz|berg,
Schwalmern, Schilthorn, Kirchfluh, Latreyenfir&s;t, and
Drey&s;pitz, are the mo&s;t remarkable mountains in this group,
which on one &s;ide borders the valley of Lauterbrunnen, and
on the other towers oppo&s;ite to the Nie&s;s, at the commence|ment
of the valley of Frutingen. It is united by means of
the Sefinen alps with the Dents Rouges, and the great cen|tral
chain of granitical mountains. The mountains of this
group &s;tand on a ba&s;e of argillaceous &s;chi&s;tus, containing a
few petrifactions, which is rarely vi&s;ible but at certain ele|vations.
Towards Lauterbrunnen, particularly, a &s;ine-grained
calcareous &s;tone abounds.</P>
<P>To return to the valley of Unter&s;even. On the left is
another group of calcareous mountains, which extend along
the lake of Brientz towards Ha&s;li, and &s;tand al&s;o on an argil|laceous
&s;chi&s;tus, which is but rarely vi&s;ible. And though
the granitical chain is at a very &s;mall di&s;tance, it is, however,
&s;o entirely concealed by the&s;e &s;econdary mountains, as to be
no where di&s;covered, except between Unter&s;even and Inter|lachen,
<PB N="70" REF="78">
where the Jungfrau pre&s;ents her&s;elf in all her ma|je&s;ty.
From the&s;e delightful plains I attempted to penetrate
towards the granitical chain of alps, through narrow vallies
enclo&s;ed between perpendicular rocks of an enormous
height; but every where I met with &s;econdary mountains,
which, to a con&s;iderable height, conceal the primitive bed of
granite, and render the approach to it extremely dangerous,
if not impracticable. Thus the valley of Lauterbrunnen is
bordered by calcareous rocks even to its farther extremity.
At Sichellauinen the fir&s;t ma&s;&s;es of granite appear, forming
the ba&s;e of the calcareous rocks, which are of a very great
height. As I continued my route towards the chain, which
&s;tretches from the Jungfrau to the Gro&s;shorn and Breithorn,
I ob&s;erved a rock of &s;teatite, in which &s;ome veins of lead
have been di&s;covered and worked at Hohalp. Higher up is
the true granitical chain, which, however, even there is fre|quently
covered with calcareous peaks.</P>
<P>I FOUND the approach to this chain le&s;s difficult at
Wengenalp, the la&s;t of a group of calcareous and &s;chi&s;tous
mountains between Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, which
there joins the Jungfrau, the &s;ummits whereof appear to
be of granite. In the valley of Grindelwald I ob&s;erved
only the argillaceous &s;chi&s;tus and calcareous &s;tone: the
external parts of the Eger of the Mettenberg, and of the
Wetterhorn, are chiefly calcareous, and cover the granite of
the central chain; and the only pieces of granite are the
fragments, which are brought into the valley by the two
glaciers. That chain, which is oppo&s;ite to the&s;e glaciers,
and borders the northern &s;ide of the valley of Grindelwald,
<PB N="71" REF="79">
has an argillaceous ba&s;e, which in &s;everal places, particularly
towards Ha&s;li, contains cornua ammones: this ba&s;e is al&s;o
covered with calcareous rocks, through which it often pene|trates
at different heights.</P>
<P>I WILL now take a nearer view of the primitive chain,
and trace the alps in the &s;ame order as they are marked upon
the annexed plan. I &s;hall con&s;ider the Jungfrau as the
center, from which I will take my departure on one &s;ide to|wards
the Gemmi, and on the other towards the Schreck|horn,
Wetterhorn, and Grim&s;el.</P>
<P>THE Jungfrau, or Virgin, is one of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t
beautiful mountains in the canton of Berne. The granite
does not appear till a very con&s;iderable elevation; its foot
being in mo&s;t parts covered by rocks, which are of calcare|ous
&s;tone, called by the natives <HI>Staldenflub,</HI> of which an ele|vated
peak is denominated the Monk. On following the&s;e
rocks to Sichellauinen, about two leagues from Lauterbrun|nen,
I ob&s;erved a red &s;tratum, that &s;eems to form the &s;epa|ration
between the granite and the calcareous &s;ub&s;tance: it
is compo&s;ed of an argillaceous &s;late of red colour, &s;potted
with brown and green, and of a fine-grained iron ore (as I
was &s;urpri&s;ed to find) containing anomites. I ob&s;erved the
&s;ame &s;tratum at the bottom of the Eger and Wetterhorn, and
of &s;everal mountains towards Ha&s;li: I remarked it at different
heights; but as all acce&s;s to them has been hitherto found
impracticable, I cannot attempt to explain a phaenomenon,
which merits a nearer inve&s;tigation. The chain of the
Jungfrau &s;tretches to the right by tho&s;e inacce&s;&s;ible peaks
<PB N="72" REF="80">
called the Glet&s;cherhorn, Ebenfluh, Mittaghorn, Gro&s;shorn,
Breithorn. I am entirely unacquainted with their &s;tructure,
except from the fragments, which I have ob&s;erved at their
feet, or on the ma&s;&s;es of ice de&s;cending from their tops.
Lime&s;tone occurs at very con&s;iderable heights; particularly
white marble, and a fine grey marble, which is the matrix of
a red hematite filled with innumerable &s;mall chry&s;tals of
iron of an octagon figure, and attractable by the magnet.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e &s;tones, I noticed on the glaciers of Breit|lauinen
and Breithorn, various &s;pecies of granite, both fo|liated
and in blocks, of iron-&s;tone, of <HI>&s;axum fornacum,</HI> or
<HI>&s;tel&s;tein,</HI> and of argillaceous and micaceous &s;chi&s;tus. All the&s;e
fragments &s;ufficiently prove, that granite prevails in the
higher parts, although it is frequently covered with &s;econ|dary
mountains. To the right is the maje&s;tic Blumlis alp,
which is a fine object from the plains: a large glacier,
mentioned by no author, &s;tretches at its feet. I fir&s;t noticed
it from the oppo&s;ite heights of Oe&s;chenengrat, and at the
&s;ame time ob&s;erved, that the feet of the Alp&s;chelenhorn and
Blumlis alp are covered with black &s;chi&s;tus, and that the
granite is not apparent, but at a great height.</P>
<P>A FEW days after this expedition, I mounted to the &s;um|mit
of the glacier, called by the pea&s;ants Gamchiglet&s;cher,
where it forms a very &s;teep ridge towards the valley of
Lauterbrunnen. From thence I beheld the va&s;t amphitheatre
of the Luterbrunnen glaciers: I remarked al&s;o, that the valley
of Lauterbrunnen ends at this place; that it has only one
i&s;&s;ue behind Blumlis alp, where a large glacier, with a plain
<PB N="73" REF="81">
and unbroken &s;urface, &s;tretches towards the valley of Ga&s;ter.
Here then is the extremity of the valley of Lauterbrunnen,
which expands at the feet of the Eger and the Jungfrau,
continues almo&s;t in a &s;trait line as far as Sichellauinen to the
foot of the Gletcher-horn and of the glacier of Stuffi&s;tein,
where it forms an angle, and bends towards Blumlis alp.
The ridge of the glacier of Gamchi is of a black calcareous
&s;tone, which, in many places, is of a fine texture, and &s;plits
into lamina of a rhomboidal form: in other parts it is coar&s;ely
granulated, containing white and black &s;par. The &s;ides of
the Blumlis alp, that border the glacier, are black &s;late, in
which I found &s;everal balemnites, and a fragment of a cornu
ammonis a foot in diameter. The pieces of granite which
are di&s;covered upon the glacier, and which mo&s;t probably
fell from the &s;ummits of the Blumlis alp and of the Dents
Rouges, is very &s;imilar to that granite, in which the veins
of lead are traced near Sichellauinen in the valley of Lau|terbrunnen.
The granitical chain, which extends on the
right by the Alp&s;chelenhorn, and the Altits, is entirely con|cealed
and lo&s;t in Mount Gemmi, where only calcareous
&s;tone and &s;late are di&s;covered. As I have not yet had any
opportunity to examine the mountains of Simmenthal and
of Ge&s;&s;enay, I cannot inform you, if the granite appears
through any of their calcareous covering.</P>
<P>BUT let us return to the Jungfrau, and trace the moun|tains
towards Grindelwald and the Grim&s;el. The two high
pyramids which tower near the Jungfrau are the two
Egers, called from their po&s;ition Exterior and Interior. Cal|careous
&s;tone is vi&s;ible to a great height. Many per&s;ons
indeed pretend, that the whole &s;ide of the Exterior Eger,
<PB N="74" REF="82">
towards Grindelwald is entirely calcareous; but I am con|vinced,
from repeated ob&s;ervations, that the &s;ub&s;tance of
the&s;e mountains is granite, though it is covered with cal|careous
&s;tone lying on reddi&s;h &s;late, which in many places
forms a &s;pecies of bre&s;cia, compo&s;ed of an argillaceous ba&s;e,
covered with calcareous fragments. You ob&s;erve behind
the Exterior Eger two &s;mall peaks, which &s;eem united by a
ridge: the&s;e are the Vie&s;cherhorn and Ze&s;enberg, which
overlook the inferior glacier of Grindelwald. The &s;tones
that have fallen on the glacier &s;how, that their &s;ummits, as
well as that of the Schreckhorn, are of granite in blocks,
veined granite, and other lamellated rocks, which frequently
contain green &s;teatites, amianthus, and chry&s;tals of quartz.</P>
<P>THE high peak, which appears to &s;tand near the Ze&s;en|berg,
is at a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and probably &s;epa|rated
from it by large vallies of ice. This peak, that has
hitherto e&s;caped the mention of travellers, &s;eems to be the
Fin&s;ter-aar-horn, which can only be approached from the
Grim&s;el; and by traver&s;ing the glacier of the Aar. I have
&s;een it from the &s;ummits of the St. Gothard, from one of the
heights which &s;eparate the valley of Grindelwald from the
lake of Brientz; I have been at its foot upon the glacier of
the Fin&s;ter-aar; and on all &s;ides, and in all places, its elevation
is &s;tupendous, and appears to me to exceed even that of the
Schreckhorn, which has been hitherto con&s;idered as the
highe&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Schreckhorn, or peak of terror, ri&s;es between the
two glaciers of Grindelwald. Concealed by its ba&s;e, the Met|tenberg,
it is not &s;een from the valley of Grindelwald; and
<PB N="75" REF="83">
the rugged paths which lead acro&s;s the &s;uperior glacier to
its foot, are extremely difficult and dangerous. Part of it is
ob&s;erved from that glacier. The tops of the Mettenberg are
of granite, and its lower parts of lamellated rock, blended
with mica and quartz. The piked &s;ummits of the Schreck|horn,
which ri&s;e to an enormous height, appear to be of
pure granite and other primitive &s;tones. The next in this
chain, is the Wetterhorn, or Stormy Peak, who&s;e perpen|dicular
&s;ides border the &s;uperior glacier. The exterior part
of this mountain is of calcareous &s;tone to a very con&s;iderable
elevation, but its &s;ummits are undoubtedly of primitive rock.
I noticed along its &s;ides the &s;ame red &s;tratum, which makes
its appearance on the Eger and at the foot of the Jungfrau.
Behind the Wetterhorn is &s;een an elevated rock, which is
&s;aid by the inhabitants of Grindelwald to border the glacier
of the Lauter-aar, and which from thence has been a&s;cended
by &s;everal <HI>cha&s;&s;eurs.</HI> On examining the &s;tones which have
been brought down by the &s;uperior glacier, I did not di&s;|cover
much granite in ma&s;s, but often veined granite, and
lamellated rock, which frequently enclo&s;e pieces of the cor|neus
&s;patho&s;us mixed with &s;teatites, pyrites, and quartz.
The foot of the Wetterhorn and that of the Mettenberg
contain, in &s;everal places, a fine &s;pecies of white marble,
with red, green, and yellow veins: a quarry of which, now
covered by the inferior glacier, was formerly worked.</P>
<P>IN pa&s;&s;ing from Grindelwald to Meyringen, I traver&s;ed
the Scheidek, which entirely con&s;i&s;ts of black &s;late, that
&s;tands on the foot of the Wetterhorn. This &s;late continues
to compo&s;e the chain that divides Grindelwald from the
<PB N="76" REF="84">
plains of Ha&s;li and the lake of Brientz. As I de&s;cended the
Scheidek, I ob&s;erved, on my right hand, the chain that joins
the Wetterhorn and runs towards the Grim&s;el. As I have
not particularly examined this chain, I &s;hall only remark in
general, that from an inve&s;tigation of the &s;tones and frag|ments
which &s;trew the vallies and &s;ides of the hills, it ap|pears
to contain the &s;ame &s;pecies of marble which I found
on the &s;uperior glacier of Grindelwald, al&s;o red &s;late, argil|laceous
bre&s;cia, and various granites. But this much is cer|tain,
that the front of the&s;e mountains is entirely concealed
by &s;econdary &s;ub&s;tances; and the true region of granite was
not apparent, until I had pa&s;&s;ed Meyringen and a&s;cended
the Grim&s;el, during the greate&s;t part of which a&s;cent I only
noticed lamellated rocks and granite. All the mountains
which form the Grim&s;el and the neighbouring chain, are
concealed in my plan by the Wetterhorn; they extend
behind the Schreckhorn as far as the Fin&s;ter-aar-horn. This
is the true region of granite and other primitive rocks, the
heart of the central chain, and the great ob&s;ervatory of the
naturali&s;t.

of the inhabitants is vi&s;ible from the cultivation of the
grounds, and the number and neatne&s;s of the cottages and
farm-hou&s;es which are &s;cattered about the fields, &s;kirted by
trees, or half concealed amid tufts of wood.</P>
<P>THUN is di&s;tant about twelve miles from Berne: it oc|cupies
the bottom and the brow of a hill, and &s;tands on both
&s;ides of the Aar. It contains twelve hundred &s;ouls, enjoys
con&s;iderable immunities, has its own magi&s;trates and courts
of ju&s;tice, in which the bailif from Berne always pre&s;ides,
and from who&s;e deci&s;ion an appeal lies to the capital. The
inhabitants employ them&s;elves in carding and &s;pinning &s;ilk
for the manufactures of Ba&s;le. Some of the burghers po&s;&s;e&s;s
large herds of cattle. To the north-ea&s;t &s;tands, on an emi|nence,
the church and the ca&s;tle, which is the re&s;idence of
<PB N="78" REF="87">
the bailif, and occupies the highe&s;t point. From its windows
I enjoyed a mo&s;t plea&s;ing and exten&s;ive view, not inferior in
its kind to any pro&s;pect in Switzerland. Underneath is
the town, occupying both &s;ides of the Aar, &s;tanding in a
rich plain of pa&s;ture, and bounded by a chain of hills, black
with fore&s;ts of fir, which extend from Berne and join the
Nie&s;s, a brown and rugged mountain, that ri&s;es rapidly from
the edge of the lake. To the ea&s;t, a &s;mall ridge covered
with vines and trees; and to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, part of the lake
of Thun, bounded by hills ri&s;ing to the mountains and alps
of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, &startq;<HI>piled up to the clouds.</HI>&endq;
The Aar flows from the lake between two level promon|tories,
prettily &s;prinkled with trees, on one of which &s;tands
the ca&s;tle of Schadan. The lower parts of this view, con|tra&s;ted
with the rugged rocks and mountains, re&s;emble a
painting of Claude by the &s;ide of a Salvator Ro&s;a.</P>
<P>FROM Thun I returned about &s;ix miles to the village of
Ma&s;&s;ic, where I quitted the high road and pa&s;&s;ed through
plea&s;ant thickets of beech and oaks, over fields and enclo|&s;ures;
the cottages and hamlets agreeably &s;ituated in lawns,
and amid clumps of trees. In about an hour and a half I en|tered
the road which leads from Berne to Langenau, and
a&s;cended to the upper part of the village of Worbe, where I
pa&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t agreeable day with an amiable family, who
favoured me with a mo&s;t cordial and polite reception. The
view from their hou&s;e, which &s;tands in the mid&s;t of a
field, is not inferior to that from the ca&s;tle of Thun: it com|mands
a rich enclo&s;ed and well-wooded country, gently
broken into hill and dale, and watered by many lively
<PB N="79" REF="88">
&s;treams; the huge white peaks of the Jungfrauhorn, Schreck|horn,
and Wetterhorn, overtopping a hill embrowned with
&s;irs.</P>
<P>I MADE al&s;o an excur&s;ion to Hindelbank, a village about
four miles from Berne, in order to examine the tomb of
Madame Langhans, a mo&s;t celebrated work of Nahl, a Saxon
&s;culptor. Being employed in con&s;tructing a &s;epulchre for
Count d'Erlach, he was lodged in the hou&s;e of the clergy|man,
his particular friend, who&s;e wife, a woman of uncom|mon
beauty, expired in childbed on Ea&s;ter-eve. Struck with
the time of her death, animated by the recollection of her
beauty, and &s;ympathi&s;ing with the affliction of her hu&s;band,
he conceived and fini&s;hed this affecting monument. It is
placed in the body of the church, &s;unk into the pavement like
a grave, and covered with two folding doors. When the&s;e
are opened a grave-&s;tone appears as if ju&s;t rent into three
fractures, through which is half di&s;covered the figure of a
woman &s;lightly veiled with a &s;hroud. She is repre&s;ented at
the moment of the re&s;urrection, when &startq;<HI>the graves are com|manded
to yield up their dead.</HI>&endq; With her right hand &s;he is
gently rai&s;ing that portion of the broken grave-&s;tone which
lies over her head; and in the other holds a naked infant
&s;truggling with its little hands to relea&s;e it&s;elf from the
tomb. &startq;<HI>Here am I, Lord, and the child whom thou gave&s;t
me</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hier Herr bin ich; und das kind, &s;o du mir gegeben ha&s;t.&mdash;An engraving of this monument is publi&s;hed by M. de Mechel of Ba&s;le.</NOTE>,&endq;
are the &s;ublime words which form the in&s;cription.
Below is the name of the decea&s;ed, &startq;Anna Magdalena Lang|hans,
wife of the clergyman. Born 1723; died 1751.&endq; The
<PB N="80" REF="89">
workman&s;hip is by no means inferior to the original de&s;ign.
The arti&s;t has formed the whole &s;epulchre out of one block,
and &s;o naturally expre&s;&s;ed the &s;welling of the &s;tone, that the
fragments &s;eem as if they had ju&s;t bur&s;t, and were in the act
of opening. The only circum&s;tance to be regretted is, that
the materials are not &s;o durable as &s;uch a monument de|&s;erves;
being of &s;and-&s;tone, they are too &s;oft to re&s;i&s;t the ef|fects
of time, and even now exhibit &s;ome &s;ymptoms of decay.
Nothing perhaps can more &s;trongly di&s;play the &s;uperior ef|fects
of &s;implicity over magnificence, than the compari&s;on of
this tomb with the mau&s;oleum of Count d'Erlach in the &s;ame
church. The latter con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal marble figures, exe|cuted
in a ma&s;terly &s;tile, and loaded with all the emblems of
rank and opulence, &s;carcely attracts a momentary attention;
while this &s;imple grave-&s;tone &startq;<HI>&s;peaks home</HI>&endq; to the heart of
every per&s;on of ta&s;te and feeling.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VISIT TO MICHAEL SCHUPPACH, THE PHYSICIAN
OF LANGENAU.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Langenau, <DATE>Sept. 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have heard, perhaps, of Michael Schuppach, the
famous Swi&s;s doctor; of who&s;e &s;agacity in di&s;covering
the &s;eat of di&s;orders, and applying &s;uitable remedies to them,
many wonderful &s;tories are recounted by travellers; and
which, like Virgil's Progre&s;s of Fame, have increa&s;ed in the
marvellous in proportion as they receded from the &s;cene of
action. I am now lodged in the hou&s;e of this celebrated
Ae&s;culapius, &s;ituated above the village of Langenau, on the
&s;ide of a &s;teep acclivity; from which circum&s;tance he is ge|nerally
&s;tyled <HI>the phy&s;ician of the mountain.</HI></P>
<P>UPON our arrival we found the doctor in his apartment,
&s;urrounded by &s;everal pea&s;ants, who were con&s;ulting him
upon their re&s;pective complaints; each having brought with
him a &s;mall phial, containing &s;ome of his water: for, by
in&s;pecting the urine, this medical &s;age pretends to judge of
the &s;tate of the patient. His figure is extremely corpulent;
he has a penetrating eye; and a good-humoured counte|nance.
He &s;eats him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to the per&s;on who con&s;ults
him, one moment looks at the water, the next at the patient;
and continues examining alternately the one and the other
for &s;ome time, occa&s;ionally whi&s;tling during the intervals.
<PB N="82" REF="91">
He then opens the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, acquaints the con&s;ultant
with the nature of his complaints, and has &s;ometimes the
good fortune to hit upon the true cau&s;e. In a word, his
knack of di&s;covering di&s;orders by urine, has gained &s;uch im|plicit
faith in his &s;kill, that we might as well que&s;tion the
Pope's infallibility before a zealous catholic, as the doctor's in
the pre&s;ence of his patients. He has certainly performed
&s;everal great cures; and the rumour of them hath brought
per&s;ons from all quarters of Europe, who come hither for his
advice.</P>
<P>MICHAEL SCHUPPACH was formerly a village &s;urgeon, has
a &s;light knowledge of anatomy, and is tolerably ver&s;ed in
botany and chemi&s;try. His acquaintance with the theory of
phy&s;ic is &s;aid to be incon&s;iderable: the greate&s;t part of his
knowledge being derived from his exten&s;ive practice, not|with&s;tanding
he never &s;tirs a quarter of a mile from his own
hou&s;e; for he would not take the trouble of going to Berne,
even to attend the king of France. It is more than probable,
that much of this extraordinary man's &s;ucce&s;s, is owing to
the great faith of his patients; to the benefit they receive
from change of climate; to the &s;alubrious air of this place;
and to the amu&s;ement ari&s;ing from the con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
different company. But whatever may have been the cau&s;es
of his celebrity, it has come to him, as all accounts agree,
un&s;ought for by him&s;elf. He has certainly many excellent
qualities; is humane and charitable to the highe&s;t degree,
he not only furni&s;hes the indigent patients with medicines
graits, but generally makes them a pre&s;ent in money be&s;ides,
and always appropriates a certain portion of his gains to the
<PB N="83" REF="92">
poor of his pari&s;h. His wife and grand-daughters are dre&s;&s;ed
like the pea&s;ant women of the country; and he has &s;hewn
his good &s;en&s;e in giving his grand-children a plain educa|tion:
the elde&s;t he be&s;towed in marriage, when &s;he was but
fifteen, upon one of his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and with her &pound;. 1, 300; no
incon&s;iderable portion for this country. He procured a
match for her &s;o early, he &s;aid, to prevent her being &s;poiled
by the young gentlemen telling her that &s;he was pretty,
and in&s;piring her with the ambition of marrying above
her rank.</P>
<P>IF dome&s;tic harmony, and the mo&s;t perfect &s;implicity of
manners, have any preten&s;ions to plea&s;e, you would be
highly delighted with this rural family. The wife is a no|table
active woman, &s;uperintends the hou&s;ehold affairs with
remarkable cleverne&s;s; a&s;&s;i&s;ts her hu&s;band likewi&s;e in pre|paring
his medicines; and, as he talks no other language
than the German, &s;erves occa&s;ionally as his interpreter. As
a proof of his confidence in her admini&s;tration of his affairs,
&s;he acts as his trea&s;urer, and receives all his fees; which, in
the cour&s;e of a year, amount to a con&s;iderable &s;um: for, al|though
he never demands more than the price of his medi|cines,
yet no per&s;ons of property con&s;ult him without giving
an additional gratuity. She has likewi&s;e received many
pre&s;ents from tho&s;e who have reaped benefit by her hu&s;|band's
pre&s;criptions: &s;everal of the&s;e pre&s;ents con&s;i&s;t of va|luable
trinkets, with which on days of ceremony &s;he decks
her&s;elf to the be&s;t advantage, in the &s;imple dre&s;s of the
country.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="93">
THE family &s;it down to table regularly at twelve o'clock:
there are always &s;ome &s;trangers of the party, con&s;i&s;ting not
only of tho&s;e per&s;ons who are under the doctor's care, but of
travellers, like our&s;elves, who are led by motives of mere
curio&s;ity. When the weather is fine, and their gue&s;ts more
numerous than u&s;ual, dinner is &s;erved in an open &s;hed, that
overlooks the adjacent country, with a di&s;tant view of the
glaciers beyond the lake of Thun. Ye&s;terday &s;ome pea&s;ants,
whom the doctor had invited, formed part of our company;
after dinner, he gave &s;ome money to tho&s;e that &s;ate near
him, and ordered one of his grand-daughters to di&s;tribute his
bounty to the others. The benevolence of the old man, his
gaiety and good-humour, the cheerfulne&s;s of his family, the
gratitude of the poor pea&s;ants, the beauty of the pro&s;pect,
and the finene&s;s of the weather, formed all together a mo&s;t
agreeable and delightful &s;cene; and I do not remember to
have ever partaken of any meal with a more &s;en&s;ible and
heart-felt &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ingular man is very often employed in giving ad|vice
from eight in the morning till &s;ix in the evening, with
no other intermi&s;&s;ion than during the time he is at table.
His drugs are of the be&s;t kind; for he collects the &s;imples,
and di&s;tills them him&s;elf. His hou&s;e, like tho&s;e of the pea|&s;ants,
is con&s;tructed of wood; and though always full of
people, is remarkably neat and clean. In &s;hort, every thing
about him bears the appearance of the plea&s;ing &s;implicity of
former ages. I had almo&s;t forgotten to tell you, that I con|&s;ulted
him this morning; and have rea&s;on to be highly &s;a|tisfied
with his pre&s;cription: for, he told me I was in &s;uch
<PB N="85" REF="94">
good health, that the only advice he had to give me, was
&startq;to eat and drink well, to dance, be merry, and take mode|rate
exerci&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>IT is now Langenau fair; and the village is crowded
with the neighbouring pea&s;ants. Great numbers of the
men have long beards, and many of them cover their heads
with a woman's &s;traw hat, extremely broad, which makes a
very grote&s;que appearance: their dre&s;s is chiefly a coar&s;e
brown cloth jacket without &s;leeves; with large puffed
breeches of ticking. The women, who are remarkably
hand&s;ome, wear their hair plaited behind in tre&s;&s;es, with the
ribband hanging down below the wai&s;t; a flat plain &s;traw
hat, which is very becoming; a red or brown cloth jacket
without &s;leeves; a black or blue petticoat bordered with red,
and &s;carcely reaching below the knees; red &s;tockings with
black clocks, and no heels to their &s;hoes; their &s;hifts of ex|tremely
fine linen, fa&s;tened clo&s;e round the throat by a black
collar with red ornaments: the better &s;ort have chains of
&s;ilver between the &s;houlders, brought round under each arm,
and fa&s;tened beneath the bo&s;om, the ends hanging down
with &s;ome &s;ilver ornaments. I am &s;o charmed with the
&s;ituation of this village, the cheerfulne&s;s and &s;ingularity of
this ru&s;tic and agreeable family, and the uncommon cha|racter
of the humane doctor, that I could with plea&s;ure con|tinue
here &s;ome days longer; but I am pre&s;&s;ed for time, and
have a long journey before me.</P>

<P>THIS celebrated empiric died in March 1781; and Lan|genau,
which I again vi&s;ited in Augu&s;t 1786, was no longer
the re&s;ort of the &s;ick, the valetudinarian, the curious, and

<OPENER><DATELINE>Geneva, <DATE>Sept. 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I TOOK leave of my friends at Langenau, in order to pro|ceed
to Avignon; where I am going to pay a vi&s;it to the
<HI>Abb&eacute; de Sade,</HI> author of the intere&s;ting memoirs of the life of
Petrarch. Mon&s;ieur de Vigur, a &s;enator of Soleure, offered
me a place in his carriage to Berne: and, as my principal
object in travelling is to acquire intelligence, I very gladly
embraced this opportunity of leading my worthy and well-informed
companion into a conver&s;ation, not only concern|ing
the government of Soleure in particular, but in relation
al&s;o to Switzerland in general; and I found him exceedingly
well-di&s;po&s;ed to an&s;wer the &s;everal que&s;tions he allowed me
to propo&s;e to him. The next day I repa&s;&s;ed through Morat
and Avenches, and &s;lept at Payerne, a town in the canton of
Berne, which enjoys con&s;iderable privileges. Upon the
bridge over the Broye, is an antient Roman in&s;cription: as I
was endeavouring to decypher it, a plain-looking man ac|co&s;ted
me in a very &s;olemn tone of voice, and &s;aid, he had
often tried to make out the in&s;cription, but without &s;ucce&s;s;
though he could read very well, and had a &s;mattering in
Latin. &startq;For,&endq; added he, &startq;what can be the meaning of N
and I and O, and all tho&s;e great letters, which &s;eem to have
no connection with each other? Give me a page of plain
Latin, and I will tran&s;late it from the beginning to the end;
<PB N="88" REF="97">
but for the&s;e Ns, Is and Os; take my word for it, notwith|&s;tanding
all your pains, you will never be the wi&s;er.&endq; How|ever,
as I did not &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to follow his advice, but
continued decyphering the in&s;cription (which was by no
means a difficult talk) he appeared a&s;toni&s;hed at my ob&s;ti|nacy,
and left me, with an apparent air of pity, to my hope|le&s;s
fortune.</P>
<P>MOUDON is an hand&s;ome town, the principal burgh of a
bailliage of the &s;ame name, and formerly the capital of all
that part of the Pays de Vaud, which belonged to the duke
of Savoy. It was al&s;o the ordinary re&s;idence of his chief
bailif, and the place where the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates were
accu&s;tomed to meet. The bailif appointed by the &s;overeign
council of Berne, re&s;ides in the ca&s;tle of Lucens, built upon
the &s;ummit of a mountain, in a &s;ituation exceedingly pictu|re&s;que.
This ca&s;tle formerly belonged to the bi&s;hops of
Lau&s;anne, and was one of their favourite &s;eats, before the
reformation was introduced into this country.</P>
<P>GENEVA lies upon the narrowe&s;t part of the lake, where
the Rhone i&s;&s;ues in two large and rapid &s;treams, which &s;oon
afterwards unite. That river &s;eparates the city into two un|equal
divi&s;ions, receives the muddy Arve in its cour&s;e, and
flows through France into the Mediterranean. The adjacent
country is uncommonly picture&s;que, and abounds in magni|$icent
views: the &s;everal objects which compo&s;e this en|chanting
pro&s;pect, are, the town; the lake; the numerous
hills and mountains, particularly the Saleve and the Mole,
ri&s;ing &s;uddenly from the plain in a variety of fanta&s;tic forms,
<PB REF="98">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="89" REF="99">
backed by the glaciers of Savoy, with their frozen tops gli&s;t|ening
in the &s;un; and the maje&s;tic Mont Blanc rearing its
head far above the re&s;t.</P>
<P>GENEVA, which lies partly in the plain upon the borders
of the lake, and partly upon a gentle a&s;cent, is irregularly
built; the hou&s;es are high, and many, which &s;tand in the
trading part of the city, have arcades of wood, which are
rai&s;ed even to the upper &s;tories. The&s;e arcades, &s;upported
by pillars, give a gloomy appearance to the &s;treet; but are
u&s;eful to the inhabitants in protecting them from the &s;un
and rain. Geneva is by far the mo&s;t populous town in
Switzerland; and contains 24, 000 &s;ouls. This &s;uperiority of
numbers is undoubtedly owing to the great indu&s;try and ac|tivity
of the inhabitants; to its more exten&s;ive commerce;
to the facility of purcha&s;ing the burgher&s;hip; and to the pri|vileges
which government allows to all foreigners. The
members of this city are di&s;tingui&s;hed into citizens and
burghe&s;&s;es, inhabitants and natives<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Since the late revolution in 1782, there is a fifth cla&s;s, called <HI>domicili&eacute;s,</HI> who receive from the magi&s;trates an annual permi&s;&s;ion to remain in the city.</NOTE>. The citizens and
burghe&s;&s;es are alone admitted to a &s;hare in the government:
the inhabitants are &s;trangers who are allowed to &s;ettle in the
town with certain privileges; and the natives are the &s;ons of
tho&s;e inhabitants, who po&s;&s;e&s;s additional advantages. The
two la&s;t cla&s;&s;es form a large majority of the people. The
liberal policy of this government, in receiving &s;trangers and
conferring the burgher&s;hip, is the more remarkable as it is
contrary to the &s;pirit and u&s;age of the Swi&s;s. It is here, in|deed,
<PB N="90" REF="100">
more nece&s;&s;ary; the territory of this &s;tate being &s;o ex|ceedingly
&s;mall, that its very exi&s;tence depends upon the
number and indu&s;try of the people: for, exclu&s;ive of the
city, there are &s;carcely 16,000 &s;ouls in the whole di&s;trict of
the Genevois.</P>
<P>THE reformed doctrines fir&s;t preached at Geneva in 1533,
by William Farel, a native of Gap in Dauphin&eacute;, and Peter
Viret of Orbe, owed their final reception and e&s;tabli&s;hment
to John Calvin. That celebrated reformer was born at
Noyon, in 1509, and being driven from France by the per&s;e|cutions
which Francis the Fir&s;t had rai&s;ed again&s;t the prote&s;|tants,
made his fir&s;t appearance in this city in 1536. Not|with&s;tanding
Zuingle, Oecolampadius, and Haller, had re|formed
the greate&s;t part of Switzerland, &s;ome years before
that period; yet Calvin, as Voltaire ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, has given
his name to the &s;ectaries of the reformed religion, in the
&s;ame manner as the new continent took its appellation from
Americus Ve&s;pu&s;ius, although the original di&s;covery was
made by Columbus. And although Calvin was not the fir&s;t
reformer of Geneva; yet, as he gave additional &s;trength and
&s;olidity to the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, and founded the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
form of government, he totally eclip&s;ed the fame of his
friend William Farel, who fir&s;t &s;cattered &s;eeds which Calvin
brought to maturity. In truth, &s;o great was the a&s;cendency
which Calvin, although a foreigner, acquired over the citi|zens,
that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable influence even in civil
matters; and bore a large &s;hare in &s;ettling the political con|&s;titution.
Con&s;cious that religion derives &s;upport from every
branch of knowledge, he liberally promoted the cultivation
<PB N="91" REF="101">
of &s;cience, and the &s;tudy of elegant literature. To this end,
as well as to encourage theological erudition, he prevailed
upon government to e&s;tabli&s;h a public academy: but with
&s;ingular di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s declining the propo&s;al of being ap|pointed
perpetual pre&s;ident, he obtained that office for his
friend and fellow-labourer, Theodore Beza. In this new
&s;eminary, Calvin, with Theodore Beza, and his other col|leagues,
eminent for their &s;uperior knowledge, read lectures,
with &s;uch uncommon reputation and &s;ucce&s;s, as attracted
&s;tudents from all quarters.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;uch a &s;triking &s;plendour in the brighter parts
of this di&s;intere&s;ted and celebrated reformer's character, as to
render us, at fir&s;t glance, almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e dark &s;pots
which in &s;ome in&s;tances have ob&s;cured its glory. Yet when
we reflect on his a&s;perity and arrogance; and, above all, on
the cruel per&s;ecution of Servetus; we cannot but lament that
he did not ri&s;e &s;uperior to the intolerant principles of the
age, which in all other in&s;tances he helped to enlighten.
With regard to his intolerant principles, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged,
that the &s;ame uncharitable &s;pirit prevailed al&s;o among
many of the mo&s;t celebrated reformers; who unaccountably
conceived, in oppo&s;ition, not only to the genius, but to the
cleare&s;t precepts of the go&s;pel, that per&s;ecution for con&s;ci|ence
&s;ake, although unchri&s;tian in every other eccle&s;ia&s;tical
e&s;tabli&s;hment, was ju&s;tifiable in their own. This ab&s;urd
and dangerous opinion, gave great advantage to their ad|ver&s;aries
of the papal hierarchy; for, it is obvious to the
meane&s;t under&s;tanding, that, if per&s;ecution is ju&s;tifiable in
any particular church, it mu&s;t be &s;o univer&s;ally.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="102">
THE republic of Geneva is, however, at pre&s;ent, the mo&s;t
tolerating of all the reformed &s;tates in Switzerland; being
the only government in this country, which permits the
public exerci&s;e of the Lutheran religion. In this re&s;pect
the clergy, no le&s;s wi&s;ely, than &s;uitably to the &s;pirit as well
as the letter of the Chri&s;tian revelation, have renounced the
principles of their great patriarch, Calvin: although they
&s;till hold that able reformer in high veneration; yet they
know how to di&s;tingui&s;h his virtues from his defects, and to
admire the one without being blindly partial to the other.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 63.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ON THE LITERATURE OF GENEVA.</HEAD>
<P>TO a man of letters Geneva is particularly intere&s;t|ing:
learning is dive&s;ted of pedantry, and philo&s;ophy
united with a knowledge of the world; the plea&s;ures of &s;o|ciety
are mixed with the pur&s;uits of literature, and elegance
and urbanity give a ze&s;t to the profounde&s;t di&s;qui&s;itions.
Nor are letters confined in this city merely to tho&s;e who en|gage
in them as a profe&s;&s;ion, or to tho&s;e who&s;e fortune and
lei&s;ure enable them to follow where genius leads. Even the
lower cla&s;s of people are exceedingly well informed; and
there is perhaps no city in Europe, where learning is more
univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed. I received great &s;atisfaction in conver&s;|ing
even with &s;everal trade&s;men upon topics both of litera|ture
and politics; and was a&s;toni&s;hed to find, in this cla&s;s of
men, &s;o uncommon a &s;hare of knowledge. But the wonder
cea&s;es, when we are told, that all of them were educated at
the public academy, where the children of the citizens are
taught, under the in&s;pection of the magi&s;trates, and at the
expence of government.</P>
<P>ONE circum&s;tance in this &s;eminary particularly contri|butes
to excite the indu&s;try and emulation of the &s;tudents:
prizes are annually di&s;tributed to tho&s;e who have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
them&s;elves in each cla&s;s. The&s;e rewards, con&s;i&s;t|ing
of &s;mall medals, are conferred with &s;uch &s;olemnity, as
cannot fail of producing great effect. A yearly meeting of
<PB N="94" REF="104">
all the magi&s;trates, profe&s;&s;ors, and principal inhabitants, is
held at the cathedral, when the fir&s;t &s;yndic him&s;elf di&s;tri|butes,
in the mo&s;t public manner, the honorary retributions.
I met this morning one of the &s;cholars, and, &s;eeing his me|dal,
inquired its meaning? &startq;<HI>Je la porte,</HI>&endq; replied the boy,
&s;carcely eight years old, &startq;<HI>parce que j'ai fait mon devoir.</HI>&endq; I
required no &s;tronger proof to convince me of the beneficial
influence upon young minds, from the&s;e encouraging and
judicious di&s;tinctions, than appeared from this &s;prightly &s;pe|cimen.
The citizens enjoy the advantage al&s;o of having
free acce&s;s to the public library; and by this privilege, they
not only retain but improve that general tincture of learning
which they imbibe in their early youth.</P>
<P>THE public library owes its origin to Bonnivard, prior of
St. Victor, who was twice<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See page. 408, Vol. 1.</NOTE> impri&s;oned for having a&s;&s;erted,
again&s;t the dukes of Savoy, the independence of Geneva;
and who con&s;idered the hard&s;hips he had &s;uffered, and the
perils he had e&s;caped, as ties that indeared him more &s;trongly
to a city, which he had adopted as his own. He was a prin|cipal
promoter of the reformation by gentle means and gra|dual
in&s;truction. He clo&s;ed his benefactions to his beloved
city by the gift of his valuable manu&s;cripts and books, and
by bequeathing his fortune towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment and
&s;upport of the &s;eminary. His works, which chiefly relate to
the hi&s;tory of Geneva, are pre&s;erved with that care and re|verence,
which are due to &s;o eminent a benefactor. The
library contains 25, 000 volumes and many curious manu|&s;cripts,
of which an accurate and learned catalogue has been
<PB N="95" REF="105">
lately publi&s;hed by the Rev. Mr. Sennebier the librarian.
He has attempted to di&s;criminate the ages of the &s;everal ma|nu&s;cripts;
he de&s;cribes their form and &s;ize, the materials on
which they are written, the ornaments, the characteri&s;tic
phra&s;es, and mentions the proofs on which he grounds his
opinions. He adds al&s;o the notes, and di&s;tingui&s;hes tho&s;e
which have never been printed. M. Sennebier has al&s;o fa|voured
the world with &startq;<HI>Hi&s;toire Literaire de Geneve,</HI>&endq; ac|companied
with biographical anecdotes of tho&s;e natives who
have been celebrated for their learning. I &s;hould tre&s;pa&s;s too
much upon your time, were I to attempt &s;ending you an ac|count
of the principal men of letters in Geneva, I &s;hall there|fore
confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e only, with whom I am per&s;on|ally
acquainted.</P>
<P>CHARLES BONNET was born in 1720. His life has been
devoted to the pur&s;uits of literature, and to the improvement
of philo&s;ophy and &s;cience. He has proved by his publica|tions,
that his indefatigable indu&s;try in &s;earching into the
phaenomena of the creation, is equalled only by his inge|nuity
in explaining them. His works, printed at Neuchatel,
form nine volumes in quarto, or eighteen in octavo, and
contain divers &s;ubjects of natural hi&s;tory, many accurate ob|&s;ervations
on in&s;ects, on the vegetation of plants, on the u&s;e
of leaves in plants, con&s;iderations on organized bodies, and
the contemplations of nature. By &s;everal treati&s;es, and par|ticularly
his Analytical E&s;&s;ay on the Faculties of the Soul, he
has &s;hewn him&s;elf an acute metaphy&s;ician. Like his friend
Haller, he has al&s;o &s;tood forth an able advocate for the great
<PB N="96" REF="106">
principles of natural and revealed religion. His<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A tran&s;lation of his <HI>Recherches Philo&s;ophiques &s;ur les Preuves du Chri&s;tiani&s;me,</HI> has been lately given to the public, by John Lewis Boi&s;&s;ier, E&s;q. under the title of &startq;Philo&s;o|phical and Critical Inquiries concerning Chri&s;tianity.&endq;</NOTE> Philo&s;o|phical
Re&s;earches on Chri&s;tianity, and his treati&s;e on the Ex|i&s;tence

nece&s;&s;arily tends to e&s;tabli&s;h a rational belief of tho&s;e great
truths. I had frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing with this
re&s;pectable philo&s;opher: though now in the &s;ixty-&s;ixth year
of his age, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an uncommon degree of vivacity and
animation, &s;till retains his enthu&s;ia&s;m for the pur&s;uits of
&s;cience, and &s;peaks with the &s;ame per&s;picuity and elegance
as are ob&s;ervable in his writings.</P>
<P>I WAS no le&s;s ambitious of being known to his nephew
M. de Sau&s;&s;ure. Born in 1740; he was elected profe&s;&s;or of
philo&s;ophy in 1762; and has given to the public the follow|ing
&s;pecimens of his indefatigable indu&s;try, and of the ver&s;a|tility
of his talents: various remarks and experiments on
micro&s;copic animals; ob&s;ervations on electricity; on ba&s;altic
lavas and volcanic productions; on the phy&s;ical geography
of Italy. He has invented an in&s;trument for mea&s;uring
the degrees of magnetic force; and &s;o much improved the
electrometer of Cavallo, that it may be almo&s;t con&s;idered as a
new in&s;trument. But above all, his invention of the hair-hygrometer,
or an in&s;trument for mea&s;uring the moi&s;ture of
the atmo&s;phere, has enabled him to make many theoretical
and experimental re&s;earches that are detailed in his <HI>E&s;&s;ai &s;ur
l'Hygrometre.</HI> And although a controver&s;y is now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="97" REF="107">
between him and M. de Luc, concerning the propriety
of hair as an in&s;trument for this purpo&s;e; yet it cannot de|preciate
this invention; and new lights mu&s;t be thrown on
that &s;ubject by the oppo&s;ition of two &s;uch able naturali&s;ts.
His <HI>Voyages dans les Alpes,</HI> of which two volumes in quarto
have already made their appearance, treat of the phy&s;ical
geography of the alps, the formation of mountains, the ori|gin
of the glaciers, and various phaenomena of nature,
which peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h Switzerland. Unlike &s;ome phi|lo&s;ophers
of the pre&s;ent age, who from their cabinet, and
with no other knowledge of the earth than what is acquired
by books, peremptorily and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly decide on the
theory of the globe, this indefatigable ob&s;erver draws from
repeated travels, and ince&s;&s;ant experience, a fund of facts,
which may enable him to complete the great de&s;ign and ob|ject
of all his re&s;earches, that of e&s;tabli&s;hing a more perfect
theory of the earth.</P>
<P>THE cabinet of M. de Sau&s;&s;ure is an object worthy of the
traveller's curio&s;ity. It contains a collection of foreign and
Swi&s;s butterflies; various petrifactions and fo&s;&s;ils, more par|ticularly
a large variety of ba&s;alts and volcanic productions;
numerous &s;pecimens of granites and other primitive &s;tones;
which he has collected during his various expeditions, and
from parts which have been only vi&s;ited by him&s;elf. M. de
Sau&s;&s;ure has lately re&s;igned the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of experimental
philo&s;ophy, and is &s;ucceeded by my very worthy and ingeni|ous
friend Mr. Pictet Turretini, who has already di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
him&s;elf by various publications, which elucidate &s;e|veral
important branches of experimental philo&s;ophy.</P>

PAUL Henry Mallet, born at Geneva in 1730, pa&s;&s;ed the
earlier part of his life at Copenhagen as preceptor to the

<P>M. DE LUC, reader to the queen of Great Britain, and

in 1727, and publi&s;hed, in 1772, his celebrated work on the
modification of the atmo&s;phere, and on the theory of baro|meters
and thermometers: a performance which marks a
di&s;tingui&s;hed aera in the hi&s;tory of experimental philo&s;ophy,
and which we are happy to find he is &s;till carrying on under

performance, he has di&s;played a mo&s;t exten&s;ive knowledge
of nature, and has applied it with great &s;agacity in forming
a new theory of the earth, and in a happy accommodation
of his hypothe&s;is to the Mo&s;aic account of the creation. The
cabinet of M. de Luc is not only remarkable for the number
and rarity of many &s;pecimens; but more particularly claims
the attention of the naturali&s;t, as a &s;y&s;tematic collection,
tending to illu&s;trate his theory of the globe. With this view
<PB N="99" REF="109">
it may be divided into three principal parts. The fir&s;t part
contains petrifactions and fo&s;&s;ils; the &s;econd, the collection
of &s;tones; and the third, lavas and volcanic productions. The
fir&s;t part is arranged in &s;uch a manner, under three di&s;tinct
heads, as may enable the naturali&s;t, 1. to compare the pe|trifactions
of animals and vegetables with the &s;ame bodies,
which are &s;till known to exi&s;t in our parts of the globe;
2. to compare tho&s;e petrifactions of animals and vegetables
with the &s;ame bodies which are known to exi&s;t in di&s;tant
countries; 3. to con&s;ider the petrifactions of tho&s;e bodies
which are no longer known to exi&s;t. The &s;econd part com|prehends
the &s;tones under three points of view; 1. tho&s;e of
the primitive mountains, which contain no animal bodies;
2. tho&s;e of the &s;econdary mountains, which contain only
marine bodies; 3. tho&s;e which contain terre&s;trial bodies. In
the third part, the lavas and other volcanic productions are
di&s;tingui&s;hed into, 1. tho&s;e from volcanos now in a burning
&s;tate; 2. tho&s;e from extinct volcanos.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 64.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOVERNMENT OF GENEVA IN 1776.</HEAD>
<P>THE city of Geneva and its territory were formerly
united to the German empire, under the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors
of Charlemagne: but as the power of the emperors, feeble
even in Germany, was &s;till weaker in the frontier provinces,
the bi&s;hops of Geneva, like &s;everal other great va&s;&s;als of the
empire, gradually acquired very con&s;iderable authority over
the city and its domains; which the emperor had no other
means of counterbalancing, than by increa&s;ing the liberties
of the people. During the&s;e times of confu&s;ion, con&s;tant di&s;|putes
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the bi&s;hops and the counts of the
Genevois, although the counts at their fir&s;t in&s;titution were
merely officers of the emperor, and con&s;idered as va&s;&s;als of
the bi&s;hops, yet they claimed and a&s;&s;erted a right to the ex|clu&s;ive
admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. The citizens took ad|vantage
of the&s;e quarrels, and, by &s;iding occa&s;ionally with
each party, obtained an exten&s;ion of their privileges from
both.</P>
<P>BUT the Hou&s;e of Savoy having purcha&s;ed the Genevois,
and &s;ucceeded to all the prerogatives of the counts, with ad|ditional
power; the bi&s;hops and the people firmly united, in
order to oppo&s;e encroachments, which were no le&s;s prejudi|cial
to the authority of the one, than to the liberties of the
others. During this period, the re&s;pective preten&s;ions of the
<PB N="101" REF="111">
counts, bi&s;hops, and citizens, were &s;o various, as to form a
government equally &s;ingular and complicated. The har|mony,
however, between the bi&s;hops and citizens, was at
length broken by the artful management of the counts of
Savoy, who had the addre&s;s to procure the epi&s;copal &s;ee for
their brothers, and even for their illegitimate children. By
the&s;e methods, their power in the city became &s;o enlarged,
that, towards the commencement of the &s;ixteenth century,
Charles the Third, duke of Savoy, (although the form of
government was entirely republican) obtained an almo&s;t
ab&s;olute authority over the citizens, and exerci&s;ed it in the
mo&s;t unju&s;t and arbitrary manner. Hence aro&s;e perpetual
&s;truggles between the duke and the citizens; the latter con|tinually
oppo&s;ing, either by open violence, or &s;ecret mea|&s;ures,
his tyrannical u&s;urpation: thus two parties were
formed; the zealots for liberty were called <HI>eidgeno&s;&s;en,</HI> or
confederates; while the parti&s;ans of the duke were branded
with the appellation of <HI>mammelucs,</HI> or &s;laves.</P>
<P>THE treaty of alliance, which the town contracted with
Berne and Friburgh, in 1526, may be con&s;idered as the true
aera of its liberty and independence: for, not long after, the
duke was deprived of his authority; the bi&s;hop driven from
the city; a republican form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed, and
the reformation introduced. From this time, Charles and
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors waged ince&s;&s;ant war again&s;t the town: but his
ho&s;tilities were rendered ineffectual, by the intrepid bravery
of the citizens, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Berne. In 1584
Geneva concluded a treaty of perpetual alliance with Zuric
and Berne, by which it is allied with the Swi&s;s cantons.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="112">
THE la&s;t attempt of the Hou&s;e of Savoy again&s;t Geneva,
was in 1602; when Charles Emanuel treacherou&s;ly attacked
the town during a profound peace. Two hundred &s;oldiers
&s;caled the walls in the night, while the inhabitants were re|po&s;ed
in un&s;u&s;pecting &s;ecurity; but being timely di&s;covered,
were repul&s;ed by the de&s;perate valour of a few citizens, who
gloriou&s;ly &s;acrificed their lives in defence of the liberties
of their country. As a tribute of public gratitude for their
glorious re&s;i&s;tance, the&s;e brave Genevans were buried with
great pomp, and their names are recorded on a &s;epulchral
&s;tone. In memory of this event, &s;ome of the &s;caling ladders,
by which the enemy entered the town, are pre&s;erved in
the ar&s;enal; and al&s;o the petard, which was fa&s;tened to one
of the gates, when the gunner was killed before it could be
di&s;charged. The war occa&s;ioned by this perfidy was con|cluded
in the following year by a &s;olemn treaty: &s;ince that
period, uninterrupted peace has been maintained between
the Hou&s;e of Savoy and Geneva; although the king of
Sardinia did not formerly acknowledge, till 1754, the inde|pendence
of the republic.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was peace concluded with the Hou&s;e of Savoy,
than the flames of internal di&s;cord, &s;o apt to kindle in po|pular
governments, and which had been &s;mothered by their
common danger from a foreign enemy, began to appear.
During the greate&s;t part of the la&s;t century, to the pre&s;ent
period, the hi&s;tory of Geneva contains little more than a
narrative of contentions between the ari&s;tocratical and the
popular parties. The&s;e mutual &s;truggles have been occa|&s;ionally
exerted with &s;o much violence and animo&s;ity, as
<PB N="103" REF="113">
to threaten, for a moment, a total revolution in the &s;tate; but,
happily, they have been hitherto compromi&s;ed without pro|ducing
any fatal effects<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The reader will recollect that this letter was written in 1776, before the late Revo|lution of 1782, which is related in the &s;ub&s;equent letter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, the power
of the Great Council was become almo&s;t ab&s;olute. In order
to re&s;train its authority, the popular party, in 1707, procured
an edict, that every five years a general council of the ci|tizens
and burghers &s;hould be &s;ummoned, to deliberate
upon the affairs of the republic. Agreeably to this law, a
general a&s;&s;embly was convened in 1712; and the very fir&s;t
act exerted by the people in this their collective capacity,
was the abolition of that edict. An event of &s;o &s;ingular a
nature, can hardly be accounted for upon the general prin|ciple
of popular ficklene&s;s and incon&s;i&s;tency: accordingly
Rou&s;&s;eau, in his <HI>Lettres ecrites de la Montagne,</HI> imputes it
to the artifices of the magi&s;trates; and to the equivocal terms
marked upon the billets then in u&s;e. For, the que&s;tion pro|po&s;ed
to the people being, &startq;Whether the opinion of the
councils, for aboli&s;hing the periodical general a&s;&s;emblies,
&s;hould pa&s;s into a law?&endq; the words employed on the billets
delivered for that purpo&s;e, were, <HI>approbation, rejection;</HI> &s;o
that whichever &s;ide was taken, it came to the &s;ame point.
If the billet of <HI>approbation</HI> was cho&s;en, the opinion of the
councils which rejected the periodical a&s;&s;embly, was ap|proved;
if that of <HI>rejection,</HI> then the periodical a&s;&s;embly was
aboli&s;hed of cour&s;e. Accordingly, &s;everal of the citizens
<PB N="104" REF="114">
complained that they had been deceived, as they never meant
to reject the general a&s;&s;embly, but only the opinion of the
councils<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;cellaneous Works of Rou&s;&s;eau, Vol. iv. p. 279.</NOTE>. In con&s;equence of this extraordinary repeal, the
power of the ari&s;tocracy continued increa&s;ing till within
the&s;e few years; when the citizens, by a &s;ingular conjunc|tion
of favourable circum&s;tances, joined to an uncommon
&s;pirit of union and per&s;everance, have procured &s;everal
changes in the con&s;titution of Geneva; by which the au|thority
of the magi&s;trates has been limited, and the rights
of the people enlarged. Happy! if they know where to
&s;top; le&s;t, continuing to extend the bounds of their own pri|vileges,
they &s;hake the foundations of civil government, by
too much re&s;training the power of the magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent con&s;titution of Geneva, may be con&s;idered
as a mean between that of the ari&s;tocratical and popular
cantons: more democratical than any of the former, in|a&s;much
as the &s;overeign and legi&s;lative authority entirely
re&s;ides in the general a&s;&s;embly of the citizens; and more
ari&s;tocratical than the latter, becau&s;e the powers ve&s;ted in
the Great and Little Councils are very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>THE members of the Senate, or Little Council of twenty-five,
enjoy, in their corporate capacity, &s;everal preroga|tives
almo&s;t as great as tho&s;e which are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that of
the mo&s;t ari&s;tocratical &s;tates. They nominate half the
members of the Great Council, &s;upply the principal magi|&s;trates
from their own body, convoke the Great Council and
<PB N="105" REF="115">
the General Council, and previou&s;ly deliberate upon every
que&s;tion which is to be brought before the&s;e councils: in
other words, in them is lodged the power of propo&s;ing;
con&s;equently, as every act mu&s;t originate from them, no law
can pa&s;s without their approbation. In this &s;enate is ve&s;ted
al&s;o the chief executive power, the admini&s;tration of the
finances; and, to a certain degree, juri&s;diction in civil and
criminal cau&s;es. They nominate, likewi&s;e, to mo&s;t of the
&s;maller po&s;ts of government; and enjoy the &s;ole privilege of
conferring the burgher&s;hip. They compo&s;e, moreover, in
conjunction with thirty-five members of their own choo&s;ing,
the Secret Council, which never a&s;&s;embles but by their con|voking,
and only upon extraordinary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderable prerogatives, however, are counter|balanced
as well by the privileges of the Great Council, as
by the franchi&s;es of the General Council. The privileges of
the Great Council con&s;i&s;t in choo&s;ing the members of the
Senate from their own body; in receiving appeals in all
cau&s;es above a certain value; in pardoning criminals; in di&s;|po&s;ing
of the mo&s;t important charges of government, tho&s;e
excepted which are conferred by the General Council; and
in approving or rejecting whatever is propo&s;ed by the Senate
to be laid before the people.</P>
<P>THE General Council, or a&s;&s;embly of the people, is com|po&s;ed
of the citizens and burghers of the town: their number,
in general, amounts to about 1, 500, but &s;eldom more than 1, 200
meet at the &s;ame time; the remainder being either &s;ettled in
foreign countries, or u&s;ually ab&s;ent. I ought to have ex|plained
<PB N="106" REF="116">
to you &s;ooner, the di&s;tinction between <HI>citizens</HI>
and <HI>burghers:</HI> the latter, are either the &s;ons of citizens of
burghers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The children of tho&s;e who are employed in foreign countries, in the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, although born out of Geneva, are entitled to all the privileges of citizens.</NOTE>, born out of Geneva, or have obtained the burgh|er&s;hip
by purcha&s;e; the former, are the &s;ons of citizens or
burghers, born within the town of Geneva. The burghers
may be cho&s;en into the council of two hundred, but the
citizens alone can enter into the Senate, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the
charges appropriated to that body.</P>
<P>THE General Council meets twice a year, choo&s;es the
principal magi&s;trates, a&s;&s;ents to, or rejects, the laws and
regulations propo&s;ed by the councils, impo&s;es taxes, con|tracts
alliances, declares war or peace, and nominates half
of the members in the Great Council. All que&s;tions are
decided by the majority of voices; and each member de|livers
his vote without having the liberty of debating. The
re&s;triction is certainly rea&s;onable; for, in a popular a&s;&s;embly,
like this of Geneva, compo&s;ed of citizens, the meane&s;t of
whom is well ver&s;ed in the con&s;titution of the common|wealth,
and where the people in general have a &s;trong pro|pen&s;ity
to enter into political di&s;cu&s;&s;ions; if every voter was
permitted to &s;upport and enforce his opinion by argument,
there would be no end of debate, and the whole time would
be con&s;umed in petulant declamation.</P>
<P>BUT the principal check to the power of the Senate, ari&s;es
from the right of <HI>re-election,</HI> or the power of annually ex|pelling
<PB N="107" REF="117">
four members from the Senate at the nomination of
the &s;yndics, and from the privilege of <HI>repre&s;entation.</HI> The
right of re-election may be exerci&s;ed in the following man|ner:
the four &s;yndics, or chiefs of the republic, are cho&s;en
annually out of the Senate by the General Council; and
there mu&s;t be an interval of three years before the &s;ame
members can be again appointed. The u&s;ual mode of elec|tion
is as follows:&mdash;The Senate nominates from its own
body eight candidates, who mu&s;t be approved by the Great
Council; and out of the&s;e eight, the members of the General
Council choo&s;e the four &s;yndics. They have it in their
power, not only to reject the&s;e eight candidates, but all the
other &s;enators &s;ucce&s;&s;ively: and in that ca&s;e, four mem|bers
of the Senate retire into the Great Council, and an equal
number of the la&s;t-mentioned body occupy the places of
the degraded &s;enators.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the &s;econd re&s;traint I mentioned upon
the power of the Senate, the right of <HI>repre&s;entation;</HI> every
citizen or burgher has the privilege of applying to the Se|nate
in order to procure a new regulation, or of remon&s;trat|ing
again&s;t any act of the magi&s;tracy. The&s;e repre&s;enta|tions
have, perhaps, proved one of the principal means of
&s;ecuring the liberties of the people from the re&s;pective en|croachments
of the two councils; as they have frequently
prevented the magi&s;trates from &s;tretching their authority to
the &s;ame extent as has been practi&s;ed in &s;ome other com|monwealths
of Switzerland. The magi&s;trates are obliged to
give an explicit an&s;wer to the&s;e repre&s;entations; for, when
the fir&s;t is not con&s;idered as &s;atisfactory, a &s;econd remon|&s;trance
is pre&s;ented. According to the nature and impor|tance
<PB N="108" REF="118">
of the complaint, the repre&s;entation is made by a
greater or le&s;s number of citizens; and it has &s;ometimes
happened, that each remon&s;trance has been accompanied by
&s;everal hundred, in different bodies.</P>
<P>THE &s;alaries of the magi&s;trates are &s;o incon&s;iderable, as not
to offer any temptation on the &s;ide of pecuniary emolument:
a &s;en&s;e of honour, a &s;pirit of ambition, the de&s;ire of &s;erving
their country, together with that per&s;onal credit which is
derived from exerci&s;ing any office in the admini&s;tration, are
the principal motives which actuate the candidates to &s;olicit
a &s;hare in the magi&s;tracy. Accordingly, the public po&s;ts are
generally filled with men of the fir&s;t abilities, and of the
mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters. The revenues of government,
at the highe&s;t calculation, &s;carcely amount to 30, 000 pounds
a year; a &s;um, however, which, by a well-regulated oeco|nomy,
is more than &s;ufficient to defray the current ex|pences:
&s;o that this republic is enabled to provide for the &s;e|curity
of its &s;ubjects, from an income which &s;ome individuals,
in other countries, &s;quander in pomp and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>IT is very remarkable that, in a republic &s;o free as this of
Geneva, and where the true principles of liberty are &s;o well
and &s;o generally under&s;tood, there &s;hould be no preci&s;e code
of penal laws: for although the form of the pro&s;ecution is
&s;ettled, yet the trial of the criminal is private, and the pu|ni&s;hment
left to the deci&s;ion of the magi&s;trate. Nor are
the franchi&s;es of the people a&s;certained with that accuracy
which might be expected. Indeed, under Ademar Fabri,
bi&s;hop of Geneva in the fourteenth century, a certain num|ber
<PB N="109" REF="119">
of political regulations, both civil and criminal, together
with &s;everal particular cu&s;toms and franchi&s;es, were drawn
up in form; and the bi&s;hop took an oath to ob&s;erve them.
The&s;e &s;tatutes, if they may be &s;o called, were al&s;o confirmed
by Amadeus the eighth, duke of Savoy. This code, to
which the people appeal in all ca&s;es of controver&s;y, is com|piled
in a very inaccurate and confu&s;ed manner, and the ma|gi&s;trates
refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to its authority, becau&s;e it was
publi&s;hed before the independence of the republic was con|firmed.
The people have repeatedly demanded a preci&s;e
code of municipal and penal laws, &s;o expre&s;s and determi|nate,
as to prevent the arbitrary deci&s;ion of the magi|&s;trate;
and although &s;uch a code was ordered to be com|piled
in 1738 and 1768, yet its compilation has been hi|therto
deferred.</P>
<P>THE code of civil law is the mo&s;t perfect part of the con|&s;titution;
all matters concerning commerce being well regu|lated,
and private property &s;ecurely guarded. It is unnece&s;|&s;ary
to trouble you with a particular detail of the &s;umptuary
laws, which are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e in mo&s;t of the other
&s;tates of Switzerland, where re&s;trictions of that kind are en|forced.
But there is one law, relating to bankrupts, too &s;in|gularly
&s;evere not to be mentioned. If a member of either
council becomes a bankrupt, he is immediately degraded;
and from that moment is rendered incapable of holding any
po&s;t under government, until he &s;hall have di&s;charged all
the ju&s;t demands of his creditors: even his children are
&s;ubjected to the &s;ame di&s;grace; and no citizen can exerci&s;e
any public employment, while the debts of his father re|main
unpaid.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="120">
IN this city, as in all the other principal towns of Swit|zerland,
a public granary is e&s;tabli&s;hed. Magazines of this
kind, u&s;eful in all &s;tates, are more particularly nece&s;&s;ary in &s;o
populous a place as Geneva, which, if the neighbouring
powers were to prohibit the importation of corn, might be
expo&s;ed to the horrors of famine. This corn is dried by
means of machines well contrived for that purpo&s;e, and re|tailed
to the inn-keepers and bakers: a con&s;iderable profit
accrues to government; and there is always, in ca&s;e of
nece&s;&s;ity, a &s;ufficient quantity in re&s;erve to &s;upport the inha|bitants
during a year and an half.</P>
<P>GENEVA is &s;trongly fortified on the &s;ide of Savoy, and a
garri&s;on con&s;tantly maintained: but the&s;e fortifications, and
this garri&s;on, are only &s;ufficient to guard them from any
&s;udden attack; but could not be defended long again&s;t a re|gular
&s;iege. The great &s;ecurity of the republic con&s;i&s;ts in
its alliance with the Swi&s;s cantons, by means of Zuric and
Berne: and, as it is the intere&s;t both of the kings of France
and Sardinia to be in friend&s;hip with the Swi&s;s, and to pre|&s;erve
the independence of Geneva; it derives its greate&s;t &s;e|curity
from a circum&s;tance which, in &s;ome ca&s;es, would be
the &s;ource of danger; namely, that its territory borders upon
the dominions of &s;uch powerful neighbours. Geneva is the
only republic in Switzerland, which has no regular compa|nies
in any foreign &s;ervice; wi&s;ely prohibiting the enli&s;ting
of mercenaries in every part of its territory.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ACCOUNT OF THE LATE REVOLUTION AT GE|NEVA
&mdash;ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE IN|TESTINE
TROUBLES&mdash;SIEGE AND SURRENDER
OF THE TOWN&mdash;CHANGES IN THE FORM OF
GOVERNMENT&mdash;EMIGRATION&mdash;PROJECT FOR
A GENEVAN SETTLEMENT IN IRELAND&mdash;RE|LINQUISHED.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING in the preceding letter &s;ketched the general
hi&s;tory of Geneva, and de&s;cribed the form of govern|ment
exi&s;ting in 1776; I &s;hall now give an account of the
late troubles, and relate the changes of the con&s;titution in
1782. In this narrative, in&s;tead of entering into the alterca|tions
of party, I &s;hall endeavour to develop the principal cau&s;es
which excited the people to take arms, to impri&s;on &s;everal of
the magi&s;trates, and, at length, to &s;urrender the town, at the
moment when they &s;eemed mo&s;t determined to defend it to
the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>BY the edict of 1768, tranquillity was, apparently, re|&s;tored
to Geneva, and &s;everal alterations were introduced into
the antient con&s;titution. By the&s;e changes, the inte&s;tine
troubles were only &s;mothered, but not extingui&s;hed. The
<HI>Negatives,</HI> or ari&s;tocratical party, di&s;contented at the right of
re-election extorted from them in 1768, which they con&s;i|dered
as a &s;pecies of o&s;traci&s;m, were ready to &s;eize the fir&s;t
<PB N="112" REF="122">
opportunity of obtaining its abolition; while the <HI>Repre&s;en|tants,</HI>
or partizans of the people, were inclined to pu&s;h their
advantages to the utmo&s;t, and to &s;ecure their victory by a
precipitate exerci&s;e of this new privilege.</P>
<P>THE project for the compilation of a new code of laws,
which although ordered by the edict of 1738 and 1768, had
been hitherto delayed under various pretences, was another
cau&s;e of mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two parties, and was
the immediate occa&s;ion of the &s;ucceeding troubles. Many
rea&s;ons induced the Negatives to oppo&s;e its compilation.
Fir&s;t; An accurate &s;tatement of the cu&s;toms and u&s;ages
would con&s;iderably dimini&s;h their prerogatives, by abridg|ing
the great di&s;cretionary powers, which the want of a pre|ci&s;e
code mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily entru&s;t to the will of the magi|&s;trates.
&mdash;Secondly; As, in order to furni&s;h materials for &s;uch
a work, it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;earch into the an|tient
archieves; it was &s;urmi&s;ed, that many titles would be
expo&s;ed to the public eye, which would favour the preten|&s;ions
of the Hou&s;e of Savoy; and that others would be
brought forward by the democratical party, in order to
ju&s;tify farther encroachments. The Repre&s;entants, however,
continued to demand the compilation of a new code; and at
length, in January 1777, forced the Negatives to con&s;ent to
their demand, by excluding, according to their right of <HI>re|election,</HI>
four members from the Senate or Little Council.
In con&s;equence of this mea&s;ure, a committee, for the pur|po&s;e
of forming a code of laws, was appointed by the con|currence
of the Little, Great, and General Councils. This
committee was to exi&s;t two years; and the code was to be
<PB N="113" REF="123">
laid before the three Councils, for their joint approbation
or rejection.</P>
<P>AT length, on the fir&s;t of September 1779, the committee
&s;ubmitted a &s;ketch of the fir&s;t part of this code to the Little
and Great Councils, in order to profit by their ob&s;ervations,
before it was pre&s;ented to the General Council. Many arti|cles,
however, being con&s;idered by the Negatives as too de|mocratical,
met with great oppo&s;ition: the Senate propo&s;ed
to the Great Council, that the committee &s;hould be prorogued
for the purpo&s;e of amending the code; but the Negatives,
who formed the majority, decided, that the code &s;hould not
be accepted, and that the committee &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>THIS mea&s;ure was violently reprobated by one party as
uncon&s;titutional, and &s;upported as warmly by the other.
By the former it was argued, that the Great Council ex|ceeded
its powers; becau&s;e the Little Council having laid
before the Great Council the que&s;tion, &startq;Whether the
powers of the committee &s;hould be prolonged?&endq; the Great
Council, in&s;tead of deciding that point, and <HI>that</HI> only; had
determined, &startq;that the code it&s;elf &s;hould not be accepted.&endq;&mdash;
The popular party con&s;idered this mode of proceeding as an
evident breach of the con&s;titution: for it was argued, that
the Senate alone has the power of propo&s;ing, and the Great
Council the privilege of approving or rejecting the motion,
and not that of amending or altering it. Further, it was
urged, that as the committee had been appointed conjointly
by the three Councils, and the code was to be &s;ubmitted to
<PB N="114" REF="124">
their approbation or rejection; the Great Council did not
po&s;&s;e&s;s the right of cancelling the code, although they had
that of di&s;&s;olving the committee.</P>
<P>To the&s;e objections the Negatives an&s;wered, that the
Great Council did not di&s;&s;olve the committee; becau&s;e,
being appointed only for two years, it cea&s;ed of cour&s;e at
the expiration of that term; and that as to the nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;ubmitting the approbation or rejection of the code propo&s;ed
by the committee to the three Councils, it might be urged,
that the Little and Great Councils had the &s;ole prerogative
of framing a new code, and of laying it before the General
Council; that they had acted incon&s;i&s;tently in permitting
that Council to have any &s;hare in appointing the committee;
and, therefore, that they now only u&s;ed their prerogative in
re&s;uming tho&s;e powers which they had unwarily granted to
others. Many per&s;ons, however, were of opinion, that al|though
the Little and Great Councils po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the un|doubted
right of propo&s;ing to the General Council; yet, as
they had once admitted that Council to a &s;hare in appoint|ing<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Strictly &s;peaking, the names of the commi&s;&s;ioners were not laid before the Ge|neral Council; but &s;imply the propo&s;al of appointing a committee. The commi&s;&s;ion|ers were privately &s;ettled by the two par|ties; and the burghers acceded to the propo|&s;ition in general terms, as they previou&s;ly knew, that the commi&s;&s;ioners were mo&s;tly favourable to the popular party.</NOTE>
the committee, they were imprudent in rejecting the
code by their own authority; and ought, at the expiration
of two years, to have nominated, conjointly with the burgh|ers,
a new committee, for the purpo&s;es of compiling a code
of laws, according to the edicts of 1738 and 1768.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="125">
IN con&s;equence of the&s;e di&s;putes, the body of citizens re|mon&s;trating
again&s;t this act of the Great Council, that a&s;&s;em|bly
offered to undertake the compilation of the code; and to
&s;ubmit it to the public examination. The oppo&s;ite party
con&s;idering this offer as in&s;idious, many debates took place,
and various negotiations were carried on between the two par|ties,
which only &s;erved to widen rather than heal the di&s;&s;en|&s;ions.
At length the <HI>Negatives,</HI> con&s;idering the public tran|quillity
as endangered, appealed to their guarantees, France,
Zuric, and Berne, and entreated them to protect the laws and
con&s;titution. But this appeal had no other effect than to heigh|ten
the di&s;tru&s;t and &s;u&s;picion of both parties. In this cri&s;is of
affairs, the <HI>Negatives</HI> redoubled their efforts to &s;trengthen
them&s;elves by the acce&s;&s;ion of the natives, and to &s;pread the
&s;eeds of jealou&s;y between the natives and the citizens.</P>
<P>THE natives, &s;ons of the inhabitants, who had purcha&s;ed
the right of &s;ettling at Geneva, formed a numerous body, di&s;|contented
and jealous of many exclu&s;ive privileges enjoyed by
the citizens, and inflamed with re&s;entment again&s;t them, for
having, in 1770, bani&s;hed eight of the principal natives, who,
a&s;&s;erting, that the rights of the burgher&s;hip belonged to the
natives as well as to the citizens, demanded, that in&s;tead of
being purcha&s;ed, it &s;hould be gratuitou&s;ly conferred. With
a view of acquiring &s;o con&s;iderable an acce&s;&s;ion to their own
party, the Negatives courted the natives by care&s;&s;es, &s;ub|&s;idies,
and entertainments, and i&s;&s;ued a public declaration,
that they were ready to confer upon them tho&s;e privileges of
trade and commerce, which had been hitherto exclu&s;ively
confined to the citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="126">
THE count of Vergennes openly favoured the de&s;ign of
the Negatives, and even wrote di&s;patches to the re&s;ident of
France at Geneva in order to be communicated to the prin|cipal
natives, who &s;ided with the Negatives. The&s;e di&s;|patches
contained the highe&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of approbation,
and &s;trongly recommended them to per&s;evere in their at|tachment
to that party. The attorney-general conceiving
this interference contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of pro|ceeding,
which required, that all di&s;patches from a foreign
mini&s;ter &s;hould pa&s;s through the hands of government, de|livered
to the Great Council a &s;pirited remon&s;trance, di&s;play|ing
the danger which re&s;ulted from a private corre&s;pondence
between the court of France and the natives. He artfully,
indeed, &s;urmized, that the report of the di&s;patch from the
French mini&s;ter to the natives, was fal&s;e and in&s;idious, and
calculated to rai&s;e a mi&s;under&s;tanding between France and
the Republic; and even advanced &s;everal arguments, which
tended to prove the impo&s;&s;ibility, that &s;uch an extraordinary
corre&s;pondence could have been maintained. The irony
and &s;pirit of this remon&s;trance were &s;o offen&s;ive to the count
of Vergennes, that he in&s;tantly obtained the depo&s;ition of
the attorney-general; and this public &s;tep in favour of the
Negatives con&s;iderably increa&s;ed their party among the
natives.</P>
<P>IN order to counterbalance the offers of the Negatives
and the favour of France, the Repre&s;entants manife&s;ted the
mo&s;t generous intentions in behalf of the natives; and even
promi&s;ed, what they had hitherto reprobated in the &s;tronge&s;t
manner, to facilitate the acqui&s;ition of the burgher&s;hip, and
<PB N="117" REF="127">
to be&s;tow it as the recompence of indu&s;try and good beha|viour.
Thus the two parties &s;triving who &s;hould offer the
highe&s;t terms, two factions were formed among the natives;
and it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that the fir&s;t opportunity of recur|ring
to force would be &s;eized by the populace; many of
whom had nothing to lo&s;e, and much to gain in times of tu|mult
and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN effect, &s;uch an opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf on the 5th of
February 1781; when a particular quarrel brought on a gene|ral
ri&s;ing. Two neighbouring and oppo&s;ite parties of na|tives,
ca&s;ually di&s;puting, loaded each other with virulent re|proaches;
and from reproaches would have immediately
proceeded to an a&s;&s;ault, if the Syndics on one &s;ide, and the
chiefs of the Repre&s;entants on the other, had not quelled, by
their pre&s;ence, the ri&s;ing tumult. The populace a&s;&s;embled
on the occa&s;ion began to di&s;per&s;e; when a di&s;charge of mu&s;|ketry
was heard from the ar&s;enal. Several youths, who
&s;ided with the Negatives, having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ar|&s;enal
had fired<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is but ju&s;tice to the Negatives to add, that, according to the opinion of &s;ome, this fir&s;t in&s;urrection was concerted, and the Repre&s;entants fired fir&s;t.</NOTE>, by mi&s;take, on &s;ome natives of their own
party, killed one of them and wounded another. This di&s;|charge
was con&s;idered by the Repre&s;entants as the &s;ignal of a
general in&s;urrection. They in&s;tantly took arms, and
marched, in three columns, to the ar&s;enal; where, finding
only a few young men, who had ra&s;hly fired without orders,
they prudently re&s;trained their re&s;entment, and permitted
the others to retire without mole&s;tation. They then con|tinued
<PB N="118" REF="128">
under arms, and occupied the principal avenues
of the city.</P>
<P>THE next morning the committee of the Repre&s;entants
being &s;ummoned by the natives to fulfil their promi&s;es of
granting additional privileges, and particularly of gratui|tou&s;ly
conferring the burgher&s;hip, held &s;everal meetings
with the principal Negatives on that &s;ubject, but without
&s;ucce&s;s: for the Negatives, while they readily con&s;ented to
the reque&s;t of the natives re&s;pecting the augmentation of
their commercial privileges, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to facilitate
the acqui&s;ition of the burgher&s;hip. Notwith&s;tanding this
refu&s;al, the committee, embarra&s;&s;ed and alarmed at the
number and threats of the natives, determined to abide by
their promi&s;es, drew up an edict, which permitted the na|tives
to carry on trade, and to hold the rank of officers in the
military a&s;&s;ociations; and conferred the burgher&s;hip on
more than a hundred per&s;ons, taken from the natives and
inhabitants, and even from the pea&s;ants of the territory.
This edict was laid before and approved by the three Coun|cils;
the Negatives ab&s;enting them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion
from their apprehen&s;ions of the popular party, who had
made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the city. By this mea&s;ure the
Repre&s;entants e&s;teemed them&s;elves &s;ecure of having invio|lably
attached the natives to their intere&s;t, and concluded,
that nothing more remained than to enjoy the fruits of their
victory. Affairs turned out otherwi&s;e; deputies being di&s;|patched
from Zuric and Berne in order to mediate between
the rival parties, prevailed on the Repre&s;entants to lay down
<PB N="119" REF="129">
their arms; and before their departure declared the edict in
favour of the natives to be null and illegal. And when the
que&s;tion for executing that edict was laid before the Senate,
it was repeatedly carried in the negative, under the ju&s;t pre|tence,
that the mediating powers had declared it to be ille|gal;
that while the city was in the power of the Repre&s;en|tants,
who were under arms, none of the members could
venture to oppo&s;e it; and that therefore their a&s;&s;ent, which
had been extorted by fear, was ab&s;olutely null.</P>
<P>INFLAMED by this refu&s;al, the oppo&s;ite party tendered,
on the 18th of March 1782, another repre&s;entation, in
which they again &s;ummoned the magi&s;trates to confirm
the edict. The an&s;wer, expected with the mo&s;t extreme
impatience, was at length returned on Sunday the 17th
of April, and concluded with declaring, that &startq;Govern|ment
was neither willing nor able to ratify the edict.&endq;
Although the committee endeavoured fir&s;t to conceal, and
when that was impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;often and palliate its con|tents,
yet the generality of the natives, who found them|&s;elves
excluded from the favourite object of their wi&s;hes,
at the moment when they &s;eemed mo&s;t &s;ecure of obtaining
it, crouded tumultuou&s;ly in different parts of the city; re|peating,
one after the other, in a kind of frenzy, &startq;Govern|ment
is neither able nor willing to ratify the edict.&endq; As the&s;e
cries of de&s;pair were accompanied by the mo&s;t violent me|naces;
the popular chiefs, after &s;everal vain attempts to re|&s;train
the ri&s;ing commotions, acquainted the magi&s;trates
with the general indignation; and endeavoured, though
without &s;ucce&s;s, to per&s;uade them to recal or mollify their
<PB N="120" REF="130">
fatal an&s;wer. Mean while, night approached, ever favour|able
to tumults and in&s;urrections, and brought on the cri&s;is
which ruined the Republic.</P>
<P>SOME of the lowe&s;t populace having &s;et fire to a wooden
barrack, cried out, &startq;to arms;&endq; on which &s;ignal the natives
a&s;&s;embled in a tumultuous manner, and were joined by the
mo&s;t violent Repre&s;entants. The mo&s;t moderate among the
citizens, well convinced, that the fire was only a pretext,
and that &s;uch an ill-timed in&s;urrection would greatly preju|dice
their cau&s;e, di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in various quarters of
the town, and tried to prevail on the mob to retire; but
without effect. Many were wantonly in&s;ulted; and a party,
in attempting to &s;ecure one of the gates, having fired on the
garri&s;on who re&s;i&s;ted, it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the
citizens either to abandon the natives, or to join them in the
in&s;urrection. Having ha&s;tily adopted the latter mea&s;ure,
the officers of the popular party made their appearance,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, and appea&s;ed the tumult. At
length, after various un&s;ucce&s;sful negotiations to prevail on
the Negatives to ratify the edict, the popular party arre&s;ted
and confined a few of the magi&s;trates and the principal Ne|gatives;
and the chiefs of the Repre&s;entants, apprehen&s;ive
that an immediate appeal to France would be the fir&s;t con|&s;equence
of their liberty, detained them in pri&s;on as ho&s;|tages
for their farther &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>As this arre&s;t and impri&s;onment of the principal magi|&s;trates
appeared a mea&s;ure as daring and atrocious as contra|dictory
to &s;ound policy; it may be proper to con&s;ider on
<PB N="121" REF="131">
what principles the Repre&s;entants acted, and by what argu|ments
they defended their conduct. For this purpo&s;e it
will be nece&s;&s;ary to view the political &s;ituation of Geneva in
the moment of this in&s;urrection, with re&s;pect to the neigh|bouring
&s;tates, and particularly in relation to France, of
who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance the ari&s;tocratical party was &s;ecure, as &s;oon
as that power could interfere with effect and propriety.</P>
<P>THE act by which France, Zuric, and Berne guarantied
the con&s;titution of Geneva, as new-modelled in 1768, was no
longer in force; a circum&s;tance highly unfavourable to the po|pular
party. For, as by this act, the king of France could not
publicly interfere in the affairs of Geneva, except in concert
with Zuric and Berne, he had only one voice; and con&s;equently
could not effectuate any change in the government, provided
tho&s;e two cantons were united again&s;t him. The&s;e &s;hackles
being highly di&s;plea&s;ing both to the Court of Ver&s;ailles, and to
the Negatives, who were protected by that court, the count of
Vergennes, by a letter written on the 28th of September 1781,
declared to the cantons of Zuric and Berne, that Louis the
Sixteenth renounced the guarantee, becau&s;e they had refu&s;ed
to enter into views for the purpo&s;e of re&s;toring peace to
Geneva; and in a di&s;patch to the Senate, bearing the &s;ame
date, and to the &s;ame effect, he added, that the king, in re|nouncing
the guarantee, did not withhold his protection from
the commonwealth; but &s;till re&s;erved to him&s;elf the power
of puni&s;hing the di&s;turbers of public tranquillity, and of &s;up|porting
the con&s;titution. The greate&s;t number of the Re|pre&s;entants,
weakly rejoiced at this mea&s;ure, from an idle
per&s;ua&s;ion, that the mini&s;ter, fatigued with their trifling di&s;|putes,
<PB N="122" REF="132">
and de&s;pairing to overcome the per&s;erverance of the
citizens, abandoned them to them&s;elves; and, thus in the
very act which inevitably prepared &s;ubjection, imagined,
that they &s;aw the fir&s;t gleam of ab&s;olute independence.</P>
<P>SOON after this renunciation, M. de Vergennes ordered a
regiment to march into the land of Gex, which borders on
the territory of Geneva; and the troops were &s;till quartered
on the frontiers, when the refu&s;al of the Senate to confirm
the edict gave ri&s;e to the in&s;urrection. In this &s;ituation, the
popular leaders argued, that for a long time a pretext had
been wanted to appeal to Ver&s;ailles; and it was now found:
they dreaded every moment to &s;ee the French troops at the
gates of the town; they thought it therefore mo&s;t advi&s;e|able
to arre&s;t and confine the magi&s;trates, in order to intimi|date
them from calling in the &s;uccours of France, and to
render them re&s;pon&s;ible for the public &s;ecurity. Won over
by the&s;e &s;pecious arguments, the body of citizens continued
to act as if their power was likely to be permanent. They
depo&s;ed &s;everal members of the Great and Little Councils,
and appointed in their place an equal number of per&s;ons
who were favourable to the cau&s;e of the Repre&s;entants.
The Great Council thus new-modelled, executed the edict
for conferring the burgher&s;hip on the &s;tipulated number of
natives; and appointed a committee of &s;afety, compo&s;ed of
eleven members, with very con&s;iderable authority. This
committee entirely re-e&s;tabli&s;hed public tranquillity, ordered
the fortifications of the town to be repaired, and in&s;pired the
people with the mo&s;t dangerous confidence in their own
&s;trength.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="133">
ZURIC and Berne, on the fir&s;t news of the in&s;urrection,
interdicted their &s;ubjects from all intercour&s;e with a govern|ment
founded on u&s;urpation and violence, and &s;trenuou&s;ly
advi&s;ed the Syndics to exhort the citizens to an immediate
re&s;toration of the legal con&s;titution: a moment's delay, they
urged, would be inevitable ruin. A few days afterwards the
French mini&s;ter returned unopened the di&s;patches of the
new Senate, and reminded the citizens of the king's &s;olemn
engagement to &s;upport the oppre&s;&s;ed, and to protect the
antient form of government. The citizens of Geneva,
though thus de&s;erted by their allies, were deaf to all ad|monitions,
idly appealed to the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, and
di&s;claimed all overtures of accommodation except on their
own terms.</P>
<P>DURING two months the citizens and natives, apparently
&s;ecure within their ramparts, convinced either, that France
dur&s;t not venture to attack them, or that the pri&s;oners would
be the immediate victims of &s;uch an attempt, and that they
&s;hould be able to make a long and glorious re&s;i&s;tance, would
not even li&s;ten to any propo&s;al of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the depo&s;ed
magi&s;trates; and could not be prevailed upon to &s;acrifice a
part of their privileges, and particularly the right of re|election,
for the &s;ecurity of the remainder. At length, the
&s;torm gathering from all quarters, &s;lowly approached, and
hovered over the town. The king of Sardinia and the canton
of Berne, both &s;econding the views of France, di&s;patched
troops again&s;t Geneva; and their re&s;pective generals, Me&s;&s;rs.
de la Marmora and Lentulus, were ordered to act in concert
with the French commander M. de Jaucourt, who had ad|vanced
<PB N="124" REF="134">
to the frontiers at the head of a con&s;iderable detach|ment.</P>
<P>NOTHING occa&s;ioned more &s;urpri&s;e and indignation than
the junction of Sardinia and Berne with the King of France;
and yet no mea&s;ure was more con&s;onant to the views of tho&s;e
two powers. The Sardinian monarch was intere&s;ted in the
pre&s;ervation of a town, which is the chief &s;ource of indu&s;try
and wealth to his &s;ubjects of Savoy; and who&s;e inte&s;tine
troubles had already cau&s;ed a diminution of his revenue: and
as he could not in common policy permit the French to in|crea&s;e
their influence in the&s;e parts, and to quell, without
his interference, the commotions of Geneva, he <HI>voluntarily</HI>
tendered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the accompli&s;hment of &s;o
beneficial a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Canton of Berne, de&s;irous to prevent the interpo&s;ition
of foreign powers in the affairs of Switzerland, u&s;ed, in a
letter to the Syndics, the following exhortations. &startq;Re|double
your efforts with your fellow-citizens; and exert
your&s;elves in order to compo&s;e the unhappy differences,
which mu&s;t infallibly terminate in the de&s;truction of the
Republic. A &s;peedy re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the legal govern|ment
will re&s;tore to them their faithful allies, who are
anxious to employ their good offices in behalf of the &s;tate.&endq;
But when the&s;e well-timed admonitions proved ineffectual,
and the per&s;everance of the citizens had drawn upon them
the re&s;entment of France and Sardinia; Berne could not
tamely behold two &s;uch powers thus interfering in a cri&s;is,
&s;o important to her own particular welfare, and to the
<PB N="125" REF="135">
general intere&s;ts of the Helvetic union; and, as Zuric had
prudently declined to take an active part again&s;t her antient
ally, &s;tood forth with that firmne&s;s and deci&s;ion which cha|racteri&s;e
all her councils, and joined her forces to the con|federate
armies of France and Sardinia.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this powerful combination, and
even in the mid&s;t of the&s;e threatening appearances, the
Genevans continued to repair the ramparts with indefati|gable
ardour. The pea&s;ants of the territory flocked of their
own accord, and without pay, to mount guard, and to work
at the fortifications; women, of all ranks, crouded to the
ramparts, as to a place of public amu&s;ement; encouraging
and animating the men to per&s;evere in their labour, and &s;ome
even &s;haring in their fatigue a&s;&s;i&s;ted in tran&s;porting burdens,
or in planting cannon on the ba&s;tions. In the mid&s;t of this
almo&s;t univer&s;al confidence, a few prudent per&s;ons, who
fore&s;aw the impo&s;&s;ibility of re&s;i&s;tance, &s;ighed in &s;ecret; but
were obliged to di&s;gui&s;e their real &s;entiments, and could not
venture in public but with an air of hope, &s;erenity, and
fortitude.</P>
<P>MEAN while the be&s;iegers advancing on all &s;ides, the
three commanders held frequent con&s;ultations, and formed
a general plan of attack. At length, on the 29th of June
1782, M. de Jaucourt di&s;patched a me&s;&s;age to the Syndics;
in which, after expatiating on the di&s;intere&s;ted intentions of
the king his ma&s;ter, and prote&s;ting that he re&s;pected the in|dependence
of the Republic, and was only de&s;irous of intro|ducing
good order, he added, that if they would not admit
<PB N="126" REF="136">
his troops, and accept the following preliminaries of peace,
he mu&s;t force his way into the town. Among other con|ditions,
he exacted, that no per&s;on &s;hould appear in the
&s;treets, under pain of military puni&s;hment; that a certain
number of citizens, among whom were all the chiefs of the
Repre&s;entants, &s;hould in twenty-four hours retire from
Geneva; that all arms &s;hould be delivered to the three
generals; that the depo&s;ed magi&s;trates &s;hould be in&s;tantly
re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; and that a final an&s;wer &s;hould be returned
in two hours. The generals Lentulus and de la Marmora
re&s;pectively in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;ame conditions.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the rage, indignation, and
de&s;pair, which the&s;e humiliating conditions excited at
Geneva. Without the lea&s;t deliberation every per&s;on re|&s;olved
to peri&s;h rather than accept them; and the moment
of danger had no other effect than to animate and rou&s;e the
courage of the be&s;ieged. While they hurried to the ram|parts,
and were preparing for re&s;i&s;tance, the Syndics &s;ecretly
obtained from the three generals a delay of twenty-four
hours. In this interval not only the men of all ages pre|pared
for defence; but even women and children tore the
pavement from the &s;treets, and carried the &s;tones to the
tops of the hou&s;es, in order to roll them down upon the
enemy, in ca&s;e they &s;hould force their way into the town.</P>
<P>SUCH was the general ardour; that about eighty women
and girls, dre&s;&s;ed in uniforms, offered to form them&s;elves
into a company, for the purpo&s;e of defending their country.
The committee of &s;afety accepted their &s;ervices, and placed
<PB N="127" REF="137">
them in a barrack, which by its &s;ituation was covered from
the cannon of the be&s;iegers. The&s;e amazons, with a &s;pirit
above their &s;ex, refu&s;ed a &s;tation that was not &s;ufficiently
expo&s;ed; and, as the town &s;oon afterwards &s;urrendered, they
had no opportunity of proving their patrioti&s;m by a di&s;play
of their valour. All the&s;e various &s;igns of the mo&s;t deter|mined
re&s;olution, flowing unanimou&s;ly from every rank,
age, and &s;ex, alarmed the Negatives, who never had &s;u&s;|pected,
that the people would carry matters to &s;uch de&s;perate
extremities. Accordingly, their parti&s;ans conferred with the
mo&s;t moderate among the Repre&s;entants, in order to find
&s;ome means of reconciliation; but without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>AT length the fatal hour arrived, in which the an&s;wer
was to be returned: it was to expire at ten on Sunday morn|ing;
and at the fir&s;t beat of the drum the ramparts were
covered with defenders. Although the mo&s;t zealous had
only calculated on 3000, above 5000 made their appearance.
They &s;eemed to be all animated with one and the &s;ame
&s;pirit; and reminded each other of tho&s;e brave citizens of
Geneva, who by &s;acrificing their lives had repul&s;ed, in 1602,
the troops of Savoy, when the latter had treacherou&s;ly
&s;ealed the walls during a profound peace. No one ventured
even to hint at &s;urrendering; and all awaited the attack
with the mo&s;t determined intrepidity. In this cri&s;is, the
French general, at the interce&s;&s;ion of the Negatives, alarmed
for the fate of the pri&s;oners, again prolonged the period
pre&s;cribed for the capitulation. The fir&s;t effect of the&s;e re|peated
delays was gradually to abate the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the
women: they could not but feel that they were wives and
<PB N="128" REF="138">
mothers; and began to figure to them&s;elves all the horrors
of a town taken by a&s;&s;ault, and a prey to a licentious and
enraged &s;oldiery. In the next place, timid and prudent per|&s;ons
could venture to conceal their fears under various pre|tences;
and at length the committee of &s;afety, hitherto
&s;trenuous in enforcing the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;i&s;tance, &s;uddenly
changed their re&s;olution, but artfully di&s;gui&s;ed their &s;enti|ments
from the public, until it was too late to prevent the
&s;urrender.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent ferment of pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices, had
the leaders openly propo&s;ed a &s;urrender, they would have
been con&s;idered as traitors; endangered their own per&s;ons,
and accelerated tho&s;e calamities which they wi&s;hed to avoid.
For the purpo&s;e, therefore, of gradually bringing matters to
the i&s;&s;ue which they intended, they a&s;&s;embled the citizens in
the re&s;pective circles; and after warmly extolling their ge|neral
zeal and patrioti&s;m, repre&s;ented, that if the city &s;hould
be attacked in the night, it would be no longer po&s;&s;ible to
convene them. For this rea&s;on they hinted, that it would
be highly advantageous to the common cau&s;e, if each circle
&s;hould nominate &s;everal deputies, with full authority to
decide in their &s;tead; adding, that they ought rather to ap|point
tho&s;e per&s;ons, who, from their age and re&s;pectable cha|racter,
could a&s;&s;i&s;t their country by advice, while others
were defending it by their valour.</P>
<P>THIS council, compo&s;ed of about a hundred citizens, met
at &s;ix in the evening, on the fir&s;t of July, a few hours before
the la&s;t term appointed for the &s;urrender was about to ex|pire.
<PB N="129" REF="139">
The chiefs opened the debate with long &s;peeches, in
order to prepare the minds of the a&s;&s;embly for the object
which they had in view. After having repre&s;ented the &s;tate
of the fortifications, which were judged by the mo&s;t intel|ligent
engineers to be only &s;ufficient for re&s;i&s;ting an attack
by &s;torm, and not for maintaining a &s;iege of more than
three or four days; they ventured to lay before them the
nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate &s;urrender. On the bare mention
of that word, the mo&s;t violent of the a&s;&s;embly bur&s;t into
reproaches, and accu&s;ed the committee with an intention of
betraying the Republic. They declared, that they would
in&s;tantly announce to their fellow-citizens the treachery of
their deputies, who were not appointed to deliberate upon a
&s;urrender, but only upon the means of the mo&s;t effectual re|&s;i&s;tance.
Apprehending the ill con&s;equences of &s;uch a pro|ceeding,
one of the chiefs &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and barred
the doors; while &s;ome of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to retire, drew
their &s;words, and &s;hedding tears of de&s;pair, &startq;To remain a
moment,&endq; they cried out &startq;was to &s;hare the trea&s;on, and
to de&s;troy their country.&endq; Every method was attempted to
appea&s;e them: cries and exhortations were heard from all
quarters.</P>
<P>AT length, when the que&s;tion concerning the &s;urrender
was propo&s;ed, a con&s;iderable majority voted for defending
the city to the la&s;t extremity. On this determination, many
of the mo&s;t zealous, tru&s;ting to this decided majority, retired
from the a&s;&s;embly, in order to prepare them&s;elves for the
hour of danger. Another con&s;ultation was then propo&s;ed by
tho&s;e who remained; the danger of dividing into parties,
and of alienating the citizens from their leaders, was re|pre&s;ented
<PB N="130" REF="140">
in the &s;tronge&s;t colours. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions being
attended with effect; long debates re-commenced. One of
the younge&s;t in the a&s;&s;embly, being affected with the pathetic
con&s;ideration of the di&s;tre&s;s of tho&s;e widows and orphans,
who&s;e hu&s;bands and fathers &s;hould fall by the hand of the
enemy, was of opinion, that only tho&s;e who were unmarried,
and who had no children, &s;hould be permitted to defend
the ramparts. &startq;We are not &s;ufficient,&endq; he added, &startq;to
pre&s;erve the town from being taken; but enough to &s;ave
our honour, and to obtain a le&s;s humiliating capitulation.&endq;
He was interrupted by an elderly citizen, who claimed for
fathers of families the glory of fighting for their country.
&startq;I have &s;ix &s;ons,&endq; exclaimed he, with tears of exultation
&s;parkling in his eyes, &startq;and who &s;hall prevent me from
marching at their head to the ramparts?&endq;</P>
<P>IT was then propo&s;ed to conduct the ho&s;tages in the
face of the French batteries, as a means of intimidating M.
de Jaucourt from firing again&s;t the ramparts; for it was to
be pre&s;umed, that he would not expo&s;e to certain de&s;truc|tion
tho&s;e magi&s;trates whom he came to deliver. This
opinion, which for a &s;hort time &s;eemed likely to prevail,
gave place to the more generous re&s;olution of re&s;toring
the pri&s;oners to liberty, permitting the Negatives to retire
to the enemy's camp, and then preparing for a vigorous re|&s;i&s;tance.
It was urged, that &s;uch a noble mode of proceed|ing,
in &s;o alarming a moment, would probably &s;often the
re&s;entment of the ari&s;tocratical party, and induce them to
obtain from the French general more favourable terms of ac|commodation.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="141">
MANY hours were con&s;umed in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the&s;e various
opinions. The fatal period approached: it was midnight;
and the chiefs, who had now contrived to &s;trike the greate&s;t
number with a panic, won over the a&s;&s;embly to their &s;enti|ments,
by propo&s;ing a general emigration; and con&s;oled
them, in the mid&s;t of their de&s;pair, with the hopes of enjoy|ing
that liberty in another country, which they could no
longer expect to find in their own. A declaration being
then drawn up, to be delivered to the Syndics at the &s;ame
time with the keys of the city; the ho&s;tages were conducted
to their re&s;pective hou&s;es; the chiefs &s;ummoned the princi|pal
officers from their po&s;ts, ordered the cannon of &s;everal
batteries to be rendered unfit for &s;ervice, and provided for
their own &s;afety by retiring from the town before the entry
of the confederate troops.</P>
<P>WHEN the unexpected news of the &s;urrender was an|nounced
to the public, they became frantic with de&s;pair.
Some mutually embraced each other without uttering a
&s;ingle word; others loaded their chiefs with the mo&s;t dread|ful
imprecations; while a few, &s;till determined to re&s;i&s;t, in|effectually
&s;ummoned their fellow-citizens by beat of drum
to their &s;tandards. The greate&s;t part, however, having di&s;|charged
and broken their mu&s;kets, flung them&s;elves with
their faces to the ground, and lay motionle&s;s for a con&s;ider|able
time. At length a general retreat took place. The
roads were covered with per&s;ons of both &s;exes, who fled
ha&s;tily from the walls; and the Sardinians, who fir&s;t en|tered
the gates at five in the morning, found the city
almo&s;t de&s;erted.</P>

THE count de la Marmora, as if actuated by motives of
compa&s;&s;ion for the degraded &s;ituation of Geneva, marched
in &s;ilence, and without an in&s;ulting di&s;play of military
pomp; and, having occupied the town-hou&s;e and the maga|zines
for powder, vi&s;ited in per&s;on the different quarters of
the city, in order to di&s;&s;ipate all apprehen&s;ions of danger.
About noon the two other commanders made their entry:
they were accompanied by a large body of Negatives, and
marched at the head of their re&s;pective troops, with drums
beating and colours flying. Having joined the Sardinian
forces, the three generals conducted the magi&s;trates, lately
delivered from pri&s;on, to the Great Council, and re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
them in their &s;everal charges, to the found of martial
mu&s;ic. The citizens were di&s;armed; each hou&s;eholder
obliged to furni&s;h the officers with quarters; the edict of the
6th of February 1781, which had conferred the burgher&s;hip
on above a hundred natives, was annulled. In the mid&s;t of
the&s;e arrangements, the Great Council laid, with all due
form, the foundation of a theatre: a troop of comedians
was introduced; and the ari&s;tocratical party celebrated
their triumph with balls, fea&s;ts, and every &s;pecies of pub|lic
diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>MEAN while a committee appointed by the Great and
Little Councils prepared, in concert with the three generals,
an edict for new modelling the con&s;titution, which being ap|proved
at the courts of Ver&s;ailles and Turin, and by the can|ton
of Berne, was confirmed by the Great and Little Councils.
But as it annulled many con&s;iderable rights hitherto enjoyed
by the citizens, it was not probable, that it would be ratified
<PB N="133" REF="143">
by the General Council, in which the party of the Repre&s;ent|ants
had &s;till a great majority. In order, therefore, to ob|tain
its final confirmation, it was enacted, that, when the
edict was laid before the General Council, tho&s;e Repre&s;ent|ants,
who had taken up arms, &s;hould for that time be ex|cluded;
under pretence, that the in&s;urrection had rendered
them unworthy of exerci&s;ing their rights; and, that they
might e&s;teem them&s;elves extremely fortunate in not being
expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t rigour of the laws. Accordingly, on
the 15th of November 1782, the members of the General
Council a&s;&s;embled to the number of five hundred; above a
thou&s;and being excluded from giving their votes. And yet
even this fantom of &s;upreme power was &s;urrounded with
troops. Notwith&s;tanding, however, the exclu&s;ion of &s;o
many, and the general panic, above a hundred Repre&s;ent|ants,
and even &s;everal Negatives, had the courage to reject the
edict; which appeared to many, even among the Negatives,
as e&s;tabli&s;hing too rigorous an ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>THE citizens of Geneva have incurred much ridicule and
cen&s;ure, for having &s;o early and repeatedly expre&s;&s;ed the
mo&s;t determined re&s;olution never to &s;urrender the town,
and to re&s;i&s;t until it was taken by a&s;&s;ault. In a pamphlet,
&s;tyled &startq;<HI>Lettre &ecirc;crite des ramparts de Geneve,</HI>&endq; the author
combats all the arguments which might be urged in favour of
a capitulation, and vehemently a&s;&s;erts, that he, as well as his
fellow-citizens, are re&s;olved to defend the town to the la&s;t ex|tremity,
and rather to court death from the hands of the
enemy than &s;urvive the extinction of their liberties. The&s;e
a&s;&s;ertions appeared mere o&s;tentatious vaunts, as the pam|phlet
<PB N="134" REF="144">
was not printed and di&s;per&s;ed until after the &s;urrender;
and led the public to attribute vain-boa&s;ting and cowardice,
which are u&s;ually united, as e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tics of the
people of Geneva.</P>
<P>ON reviewing the hi&s;tory of the revolution with impar|tiality,
it cannot admit a doubt; that the people were una|nimou&s;ly
again&s;t a &s;urrender; that, till within a few hours
before the confederate troops entered the gates, they ex|pected,
and were prepared for, an a&s;&s;ault; that they had en|tru&s;ted
the command to the committee of &s;afety; that the
committee, alarmed at the near approach of danger, had &s;ud|denly
changed their opinion, had betrayed them into a &s;ur|render
again&s;t their intentions, and without their knowledge,
and had taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as rendered all re&s;i&s;tance im|practicable.
As the committee has been greatly cen&s;ured
for this &s;udden change of opinion; it is but ju&s;tice to add,
that of eleven members and &s;everal adjuncts, who compo&s;ed
the committee, two-thirds voted again&s;t the &s;urrender. But,
in fact, of what avail was re&s;i&s;tance at this period? Upon a
&s;uppo&s;ition that the &s;iege could have been protracted for a
few days; the kings of France and Sardinia, and the canton
of Berne, had fre&s;h troops ready to march; and in le&s;s than
a week &s;o large a reinforcement would have been collected
before the gates of Geneva, that any further oppo&s;ition
mu&s;t have been madne&s;s. In a word, the popular leaders
acted wrong in buoying up the hopes of people, that re&s;i&s;t|ance
could be effectual; and by the reparation of the ram|parts
only &s;erved to in&s;pire the public with a dangerous con|fidence,
which they were not afterwards able to allay.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="145">
SUCH is the hi&s;tory of this extraordinary revolution;
prepared for &s;ome time by the enmity of the two parties;
occa&s;ioned by the impolitic though ju&s;t demand of a code of
laws; ha&s;tened by the two in&s;urrections: and completed by
the intrigues and arms of France. It mu&s;t be acknowledged,
that the Repre&s;entants, or popular party, acted in a mo&s;t im|prudent
as well as uncon&s;titutional manner; and parti|cularly,
that no excu&s;e can be admitted for the &s;econd in&s;ur|rection,
and the impri&s;onment of the magi&s;trates. The Re|pre&s;entants,
by the edict of 1768, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great privileges,
which in time would have placed in their hands the whole
admini&s;tration of government. As the greate&s;t number in
the General A&s;&s;embly, they enjoyed the right of annually
excluding four members from the Senate, and of filling half
the vacancies in the Great Council; they mu&s;t, therefore,
in a few years, have inevitably obtained a decided majority.
The mo&s;t prudent among them &s;aw this advantage, and
were contented; but the greater part, and perhaps a few of
their leaders, eager to gra&s;p immediately that power, of
which they had only a di&s;tant pro&s;pect, precipitated mea|&s;ures;
and acting diametrically oppo&s;ite to the fir&s;t princi|ples
of their con&s;titution, ha&s;tened its de&s;truction. It mu&s;t,
at the &s;ame time, be confe&s;&s;ed, that however imprudently or
uncon&s;titutionally the Repre&s;entants behaved, yet that the
Negatives, &s;ecure of &s;upport from the Court of Ver&s;ailles,
&s;eemed to carry their confidence in their own &s;trength to
&s;uch a degree, as almo&s;t to court the troubles which en&s;ued;
and that they have availed them&s;elves of their victory to a
degree only to be palliated by ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. A new
form of government introduced by force, mu&s;t be &s;upported
<PB N="136" REF="146">
by force; by calling in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France, they mu&s;t
be entirely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to that power; and by annihilating
the fir&s;t principles of liberty, in di&s;arming the citizens and
forbidding all public meetings, they are in danger of extin|gui&s;hing
that &s;pirit of emulation and energy for which the
Genevans have long been di&s;tingui&s;hed. Having e&s;tabli&s;hed
a rigorous ari&s;tocracy, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily adopt that
jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion which not unfrequently characteri&s;es
the magi&s;trates under that &s;pecies of government: and the
only que&s;tion now remaining, is, Whether the above-men|tioned
&s;pirit of emulation and energy will be dimini&s;hed by
the change of con&s;titution; and if &s;o, whether that diminu|tion
will be counterbalanced by the introduction of a greater
degree of tranquillity than is u&s;ually to be found in de|mocratical
&s;tates?</P>
<Q>THE changes in the form of government, introduced by
this revolution, are principally comprized in the fol|lowing
articles:</Q>
<P>1. THE power granted in 1768 to the General Council,
of re-election, or of annually excluding four members from
the Senate, is aboli&s;hed. 2. The privilege enjoyed by the
&s;ame a&s;&s;embly, of nominating half the vacancies in the
Great Council, is likewi&s;e annulled; and that body is now
&s;upplied by the Senate and Great Council, according to the
following complicated mode of election:&mdash;In ca&s;e of &s;ixteen
vacancies, the Great Council &s;elects eight members from
&s;ixteen candidates propo&s;ed by the Senate; and in like man|ner
the Senate chu&s;es eight from the &s;ame number of can|didates
<PB N="137" REF="147">
appointed by the Great Council. 3. The right of
<HI>repre&s;entation,</HI> or remon&s;trating, is taken from the citizens at
large, and transferred to thirty-&s;ix adjuncts, who may be
pre&s;ent in the Great Council, on the fir&s;t Monday of each
month: they enjoy the privilege of making repre&s;entations,
and in that ca&s;e have a deliberative voice. But, as they are
removeable every year; and are drawn by lot from all the
citizens in general, who may chu&s;e to pre&s;ent them&s;elves as
candidates; they are con&s;idered as &s;o extremely dependent
on the will of the magi&s;trates, and their repre&s;entations have
&s;uch little weight, that they are called in deri&s;ion, <HI>Les Images,</HI>
or The Shadows. 4. The introduction of the <HI>grabeau,</HI> or
annual confirmation of the members of the Senate, and of the
Great Council, exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in the la&s;t-mentioned body.
This law, which may be con&s;idered as the ba&s;is of the
new con&s;titution, has transferred to the Great Council part
of the authority both of the Senate and of the General
Council. By &s;ubjecting the Senate to this annual revi&s;ion,
it has rendered that body greatly dependent on the Great
Council, which by the pre&s;ent con&s;titution is become, what
the Senate was according to the form of government e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in 1738 and 1768, the center of the ari&s;tocracy.
5. The circles, or clubs, in which the citizens u&s;ed to be
convened, and all public a&s;&s;emblies<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">One in&s;tance of the ill effects ari&s;ing from this prohibition, fell under my ob&s;er|vation: The Society of Arts in Geneva, many of who&s;e members are per&s;ons of great abilities and learning, has already given to the world &s;everal intere&s;ting publications. But as all public a&s;&s;em|blies are prohibited, government was &s;u&s;|picious le&s;t this literary &s;ociety &s;hould in|dulge it&s;elf in political que&s;tions; and ac|cordingly no meeting has been held &s;ince the late revolution. Indeed, when I was at Geneva, it was then in agitation to &s;uffer the &s;o$iety to a&s;&s;emble; but it was very un|certain whether this permi&s;&s;ion would be granted; and if granted, whether it would not be greatly fettered by the diminution of the number of its members, and by &s;everal other re&s;trictions, incompatible with the freedom of literary di&s;qui&s;itions. It is a matter of little con&s;equence to Europe in general, whether the government of Ge|neva is more or le&s;s ari&s;tocratical or demo|cratical: but it is an object of general im|portance, whether a literary &s;ociety &s;hould be prevented, by political jealou&s;y, from holding tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, which will afford a means and opportunity of continuing to &s;upply the world with learned and intere&s;t|ing publications.</NOTE>, are prohibited; and
<PB N="138" REF="148">
they are only allowed to meet at coffee-hou&s;es. This pro|hibition
was at fir&s;t carried to an extreme degree of jealou&s;y,
highly derogatory from every principle of free government;
but lately it has been &s;omewhat modified; and a&s;&s;emblies are
permitted to be held in the country, though not within the
walls of Geneva. 6. The militia is aboli&s;hed; firing at
marks, even with bows and arrows, prohibited; and the
guard of the town, in&s;tead of being con&s;igned to the citizens,
is entru&s;ted to a garri&s;on of 1000 foreign &s;oldiers, who&s;e co|lonel
and major are both foreigners: the&s;e troops take an
oath of fidelity to the Republic, and of obedience to the Great
Council, and to the Committee of War: they are under the
immediate command and in&s;pection of the latter, and &s;ubject
to the &s;uperior controul of the former. This garri&s;on may
be augmented to 1200, and reduced to 800 men, at the will
of the Great Council; but cannot be further enlarged or di|mini&s;hed
without the con&s;ent of the General Council.
7. No citizen, native, or inhabitant, is permitted to have
arms. It is not unworthy of remark on this article, that
although by the antient con&s;titution every citizen was
obliged to provide him&s;elf with arms, under a certain
penalty; yet, that when the&s;e were delivered up, govern|ment
did not reimbur&s;e the expence. 8. Several taxes were
<PB N="139" REF="149">
impo&s;ed without the con&s;ent of the General Council; but
for the future, every change or augmentation of the revenue
mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to that body. 9. Various privileges, re|&s;pecting
the equal rights to trade and commerce, formerly
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the citizens alone, have been conferred on the
natives and inhabitants; a liberal conce&s;&s;ion, to which both
parties willingly acceded.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="postscript">
<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Genevans &s;eemed &s;o greatly to deplore the dimi|nution
of that liberty to which they had long been ac|cu&s;tomed,
and to which they a&s;cribed the late remarkable
increa&s;e of their population and riches, that if we had judged
from the di&s;contents and con&s;ternation of the citizens, we
might have concluded the change of government would
have been followed by an almo&s;t general emigration. The
event, however, has not ju&s;tified this conclu&s;ion. Ex|cepting
the principal leaders, tho&s;e of the popular party who
were bani&s;hed, and a few others who renounced their
country in compliance with their political principles; the
greate&s;t part of the emigrants returned, and again &s;ettled in
the place of their nativity. And perhaps it may be affirmed
with truth, that the late revolution has &s;carcely driven &s;ix
hundred per&s;ons from Geneva. The emigrants have
principally e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves at Bru&s;&s;els and Con|&s;tance<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 3.</NOTE>;
where they have introduced manufactures of
printed linens and watch-making.</P>
<P>I CANNOT quit this &s;ubject without recalling to your re|collection,
the plan for giving an a&s;ylum to the Genevan
<PB N="140" REF="150">
emigrants in Ireland, which &s;o long engaged the public
attention. Soon after the revolution, a memorial &s;igned by
above a thou&s;and Genevans of both &s;exes, who were either
per&s;ons of &s;ome property, or ver&s;ed in trade or manu|factures,
expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire of &s;ettling in Ireland, was pre|&s;ented
to Earl Temple (now Marquis of Buckingham) then
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His Excellency, con&s;cious of
the advantage which mu&s;t re&s;ult to Ireland from the recep|tion
of &s;o many indu&s;trious arti&s;ts, many of whom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
property in the Engli&s;h, Iri&s;h, and French funds, communi|cated,
on the 27th of September 1782, the propo&s;al to the
Privy Council of Ireland for giving an a&s;ylum to the Gene|van
emigrants. This propo&s;al, patronized by the Lord
Lieutenant, and unanimou&s;ly con&s;ented to by the Privy
Council, was approved by the King. The nobility and
gentry of Ireland &s;eemed to vie with each other in coun|tenancing
the &s;ettlement; the Iri&s;h parliament voted
&pound;. 50, 000 towards defraying the expences of their journey,
and building a town for their reception; lands were pur|cha&s;ed
for &pound;. 8000 in a convenient &s;ituation near Waterford;
part of the New Geneva was actually completed, at the ex|pence
of &pound;. 10, 000; a charter was granted with very con|&s;iderable
privileges; the &s;tandard of gold was altered for
the accommodation of the watch-manufacturers; the foun|dation
of an academy approved, upon an u&s;eful, exten&s;ive,
and oeconomical plan<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The total expence of the academy would, at the highe&s;t calculation, have amounted to &pound;. 4554 per annum, and at a more moderate valuation to only &pound;. 3924. For this &s;um forty-four profe&s;&s;ors, a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and ma&s;ters would have been maintained; a public library e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the expen|ces of a &s;tudent, in the article of education, would not have exceeded &pound;. 164. 18 <HI>s.</HI> for thirteen years, or about &pound;. 12 per annum.</NOTE>; in July 1783, &s;everal Genevans
<PB N="141" REF="151">
landed in Ireland; and when the nation had expended near
&pound;. 30,000, the project was &s;uddenly relinqui&s;hed, and the &s;et|tlement
finally abandoned.</P>
<P>THE failure of this project may be principally attributed
to the following cau&s;e.&mdash;If the &s;ettlement could have been
immediately carried into execution, the Genevans would
have emigrated in very con&s;iderable numbers; but many
nece&s;&s;ary delays were occa&s;ioned by the arrangement of &s;o
complicated a plan, by the high demands of the Genevan
commi&s;&s;ioners, who, in drawing up the charter, required
many privileges which were contradictory to the laws of the
land, and by the building of the New Geneva. The&s;e delays
naturally giving time for the re&s;entment of the Genevans to
&s;ub&s;ide, many returned and took the oaths of allegiance to
the new government. To this circum&s;tance mu&s;t be added,
the departure of Earl Temple, in May 1783, who was the
great patron and promoter of the &s;ettlement; that the pro|ject,
as it lo&s;t its novelty, gradually became le&s;s popular;
that the few Genevans, who had prematurely landed in
Ireland, although maintained at the public expence, yet
were di&s;contented, at not finding the new town prepared for
their immediate reception; and that particularly, as tho&s;e
among the propo&s;ed emigrants who had mo&s;t property had
withdrawn their names; the remainder did not po&s;&s;e&s;s a
&s;ufficient capital to &s;ettle in a foreign country, and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
an expen&s;ive branch of manufacture without &s;till far|ther
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In con&s;equence of this deficiency, the Gene|van
commi&s;&s;ioners petitioned to appropriate &pound;. 10,000 of the
<PB N="142" REF="152">
&pound;. 50, 000 for the purpo&s;e of forming a capital. But, as that
&s;um had been voted by parliament for other purpo&s;es, this
petitioin was nece&s;&s;arily rejected; and the Genevans, in an
addre&s;s to the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
relinqui&s;hed the &s;ettlement; and &s;oon afterwards quitted
that country.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 66.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ACCOUNT OF THE LATE TUMULTS AND REVOLU|TION
OF GENEVA IN 1789.</HEAD>
<P>THE late revolution of 1789 having greatly changed
the form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1782, and de|&s;cribed
in the former letter, I here &s;ubmit to your peru&s;al a
&s;hort account of the cau&s;es and termination of tho&s;e tu|mults,
which have been the means of re&s;toring Geneva
to its former liberty.</P>
<P>THE edict of pacification pa&s;&s;ed in 1782 &s;ucceeded to a
long &s;eries of di&s;&s;en&s;ions between the popular and ari&s;tocra|tical
parties. France, Sardinia, and Berne, by who&s;e do|minions
Geneva is encircled, beholding, with regret and di&s;|plea&s;ure,
the flames of civil di&s;cord occa&s;ionally &s;mothered,
but continually bur&s;ting forth on the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion, had
combined in order to &s;ettle a <HI>fixed</HI> and <HI>permanent</HI> con&s;titu|tion,
and took &s;uch precautions as &s;eemed calculated to pre|vent
in future any effectual oppo&s;ition to the government
which they thought proper to e&s;tabli&s;h. By the combined
forces of the three powers, the far greater part of the Gene|vans
were compelled to &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t grievous con|ditions:
the exile of their popular chiefs, the prohibition of
carrying arms, and a foreign garri&s;on quartered in barracks,
at the entire di&s;po&s;al of government, formed the ba&s;is which
<PB N="144" REF="154">
&s;upported the new con&s;titution. From that period a calm
of a few years, almo&s;t unknown to the Republic, &s;ucceeded;
but it was a &s;ullen and a lowering calm: the people were
kept in order by the precaution of a military force, not cal|culated
for a &s;mall republic; the taxes impo&s;ed for the
maintenance of that military force, and for building bar|racks,
were heavy, and their burden was felt the more, be|cau&s;e
they con&s;tantly reminded the Genevans of their hu|miliation
and &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>DURING my &s;ub&s;equent vi&s;its to Geneva, in 1785 and the
following year, I found an almo&s;t general di&s;content prevail|ing
among all parties; many of the Negatives di&s;affected;
the Repre&s;entants &s;ubmitting in &s;ilent and &s;ullen de&s;pair;
and the people without &s;pirit and energy. The wi&s;dom of
many of the regulations pa&s;&s;ed in 1782 was overlooked, or
forgotten: tho&s;e only which annihilated the fir&s;t principles
of liberty were remembered; and almo&s;t the only &s;entiment
which prevailed, was the &s;entiment of degradation, ari&s;ing
from the &s;ubjection of a free people to a military govern|ment.
In this &s;tate of affairs and general di&s;affection to the
ruling party, many of the citizens &s;ecretly entertained hopes
of another revolution; either founding their expectations
on the embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of France, or on the favourable
di&s;po&s;ition of the Great and Little Councils, the members of
which had for &s;ome time fatally experienced many difficul|ties
in &s;upporting the authority of government. The minds
of the greate&s;t part were ready to take advantage of every in|cident
likely to effect a change of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="155">
SUCH a general &s;pirit of di&s;affection had gone forth
among the people, that admini&s;tration had been compelled
to employ a military force in order to quell a tumult, which
took its ri&s;e in the theatre on the 12th of December 1783.</P>
<P>THE quelling of this tumult was only a temporary
remedy; and the popular di&s;contents broke out uncontrouled
on the 26th of January, on account of the publication of an
edict rai&s;ing the price of bread a farthing in the pound.
This augmentation, though ju&s;tified by the &s;carcity of flour,
and pa&s;&s;ed principally with a view to prevent the exportation
of bread, was yet imprudently laid on in the pre&s;ent temper
of the people. An in&s;urrection in&s;tantly took place; the
bakers &s;hops were pillaged, and on the following day a car|riage
laden with bread, and e&s;corted by &s;oldiers, was plun|dered
in its way to the di&s;tribution-office in the quarter of
St. Gervais. The &s;oldiers, firing at the populace, killed one
man and wounded another: the numbers and fury of the
rioters increa&s;ed; they drove away the troops, and carried
the body of the decea&s;ed, in a kind of funeral proce&s;&s;ion,
before the town-hou&s;e, as a memorial of violence and op|pre&s;&s;ion.
The populace, rou&s;ed to frenzy at this &s;pectacle,
attacked and occupied two gates of the city, and danger|ou&s;ly
wounded the commanding officer, as he was en|deavouring
to re&s;train the ardour of his &s;oldiers and the fury
of the people.</P>
<P>IN all tumults and in&s;urrections the fir&s;t moments are
precious. The magi&s;trates, in&s;tead of acting deci&s;ively, had
lo&s;t them in deliberation; and the po&s;ition of government
<PB N="146" REF="156">
became more and more embarra&s;&s;ing. On the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion
it was nece&s;&s;ary either to retake the gates, which had
been occupied by the in&s;urgents, or to confe&s;s, that the mili|tary
force, by which they had hitherto kept the people in
awe, was no longer capable of enforcing obedience. The
military committee, charged with the command of the gar|ri&s;on
for the &s;ecurity of the city, fluctuated between their
duty to quell the in&s;urrection, and their repugnance to &s;hed
the blood of their fellow-citizens. In this dilemma they
he&s;itated for &s;ome time, and at length ordered two bodies of
troops to force their pa&s;&s;age over the two bridges of the
Rhone which &s;eparate the quarter of St. Gervais from the
remainder of the city, and to retake the gate on the &s;ide of
Switzerland. They flattered them&s;elves, that the people
would retire at the fir&s;t appearance of a con&s;iderable body of
&s;oldiers. But it was now too late: the in&s;urgents had
already formed a &s;trong barricade, behind which they
played off two fire-pumps, filled with boiling water and
&s;oap-lees, again&s;t the extremities of each bridge; the cro&s;s
&s;ire of &s;everal &s;mall arms, which poured from the windows
and tops of the adjacent hou&s;es, wounded &s;everal &s;oldiers
and killed the commanding officer; the pavement of the
&s;treets was torn up, and carried to the tops of the hou&s;es,
in order to be hurled down upon the troops, if they forced
the barricades and penetrated into the town. Meanwhile
the tumult &s;pread it&s;elf into the other parts of the city,
and was in danger of becoming univer&s;al. In this &s;tate of
affairs the magi&s;trates, finding that they could not quell the
in&s;urrection without great effu&s;ion of blood, found them|&s;elves
under the nece&s;&s;ity of complying with the demands of
<PB N="147" REF="157">
the in&s;urgents. One of the principal magi&s;trates repaired in
per&s;on to the quarter of St. Gervais, proclaimed an edict for
lowering the price of bread, granted a general amne&s;ty, and
relea&s;ed all the in&s;urgents that had been taken into cu&s;tody.
The&s;e conce&s;&s;ions re&s;tored indeed a momentary calm; but
produced the very effect they were intended to avoid.
The leaders of the di&s;affected party, now convinced, either
of the inability or unwillingne&s;s of government to employ a
&s;ufficient degree of force, and fore&s;eeing that the moderation
which had been ju&s;t adopted mu&s;t be continued, held them|&s;elves
in readine&s;s to take advantage of any opportunity
which pre&s;ented it&s;elf of exciting or encouraging another
in&s;urrection, in order to effect a change of government, and
a recovery of former privileges. Such an opportunity pre|&s;ented
it&s;elf on the 29th of January, at the interment of a
woman who had been ca&s;ually killed by the di&s;charge of the
military in the tumult of the 26th. An immen&s;e concour&s;e
of people attended the funeral: and the magi&s;trates impru|dently
ordered the garri&s;on to be ranged and po&s;ted with
cannon, for the &s;ecurity of the barracks and the city gates
again&s;t any attempts of the multitude. The populace, be|lieving
that the garri&s;on was drawn out in order to re-com|mence
ho&s;tilities, ro&s;e in&s;tantly, with one accord directed
their fury again&s;t the &s;oldiers, drove them from their po&s;ts,
di&s;armed them, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city gates with|out
oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THIS &s;econd tumult convinced the magi&s;trates that all
farther oppo&s;ition was fruitle&s;s. For, as the generality of
the citizens and burghers, in&s;tead of taking an active part in
<PB N="148" REF="158">
quelling the tumults, had rather &s;eemed to countenance and
encourage them, it was evident, that the lo&s;s of their li|berties,
and the humiliation to which they were reduced by
the edict of 1782, had ab&s;orbed every &s;entiment of affection
and reverence for an admini&s;tration, which, however ju&s;t
and rea&s;onable in its mea&s;ures and conduct, was founded on
the principles of de&s;poti&s;m, and &s;upported by force. Im|pre&s;&s;ed
with the&s;e con&s;iderations, and finding by experience
that a military government was both inexpedient and in|effectual,
the chiefs of the ari&s;tocratical party &s;uddenly
changed the &s;y&s;tem, by which they had been hitherto
guided, and renounced, by a very extraordinary revolution
in their &s;entiments, that line of conduct to which they had
before &s;o ob&s;tinately adhered. They now felt, that in &s;o
&s;mall a republic, and with &s;uch new objects of ambition, the
only permanent recompence of their political labours could
be drawn from the e&s;teem, attachment, and confidence of
their fellow-citizens; they felt al&s;o, that, acting from that
principle, the wi&s;e&s;t conduct to be adopted on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion
was, to change a con&s;titution which had been proved
to be e&s;&s;entially defective; and which, while it abridged or
annihilated the deare&s;t rights and privileges of a freeborn
&s;ubject, was ineffectual in maintaining it&s;elf by the u&s;ual com|panion
of de&s;poti&s;m, the terror of a military force. When,
therefore, the Solicitor-General, in the name of the citizens
and burghers, &s;olicited the recovery of their antient liberties,
the permi&s;&s;ion of bearing arms, the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the
militia, and of their circles or political clubs, the removal of
the garri&s;on from the barracks, and the recall of the Repre|&s;entants,
who were bani&s;hed in 1782; &s;uch moderate
<PB N="149" REF="159">
demands were received with complacency and even &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P>THE two parties, fatigued with pa&s;t di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and
anxious to re-unite in the common cau&s;e, con&s;ented to &s;a|crifice
&s;omething of their re&s;pective claims, and to u&s;e the
power re&s;erved to them in 1782, by the guaranties, of
amending and changing the laws, by a majority of three-fourths.
The preliminaries were &s;ettled without difficulty;
a committee was appointed to revi&s;e and amend the edict of
1782; the new edict of pacification, under the title of <HI>Mo|difications
&agrave; l'Edit de</HI> 1782, was approved by the Senate,
Great Council, and General Council. Such was the almo&s;t
general unanimity with which this bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted,
that in the a&s;&s;embly of the General Council which met on
the 10th of February, the <HI>modifications</HI> were carried by 1321
&s;uffrages again&s;t 52. The publication of the new edict was
followed by the loude&s;t acclamations and general rejoicings,
and confirmed by the three guaranties.</P>
<P>THE edict of 1782 is valid in all the articles which are
not repealed or amended by the pre&s;ent <HI>modifications;</HI> or, to
u&s;e the words of the pre&s;ent amendments, &startq;The edict of
the 21&s;t of November 1782, with the modifications intro|duced
by the pre&s;ent edict, and the political code publi&s;hed
on the 13th of June 1783, &s;hall be the fundamental law of
the &s;tate, and &s;hall form the complete collection of its po|litical
&s;tatutes.&endq; The con&s;titution is now wi&s;ely modelled
into a mean between the too popular form e&s;tabli&s;hed in
1768, and the too ari&s;tocratical form e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1782. The
<PB N="150" REF="160">
magi&s;trates have con&s;ented to repeal the mo&s;t obnoxious
articles in the edict of 1782; which may be principally re|duced
to the following heads:</P>
<P>1. THE garri&s;on is &s;ubject, as before the edict of 1782, to
the orders of the Senate, of the Syndic of the Guard, and of
the members of the Great Council; and is to be no longer
quartered in barracks. The garri&s;on is to be gradually re|duced
to 600 men; but to be increa&s;ed to 720, at the will of
the Great Council. The officers are to be cho&s;en by the
Great Council, from the citizens, burghers, and natives.
2. The militia to be re-embodied, and the military exerci&s;es
to be renewed. A regiment of volunteers to be formed from
the citizens, burghers, natives, and inhabitants, under the
orders of the Senate and Syndic of the Guard. 3. All
citizens, burghers, natives, inhabitants, and &s;ubjects, are
permitted to bear arms; all other per&s;ons dwelling in the
city are prohibited from carrying fire-arms without per|mi&s;&s;ion.
4. The circles, or political clubs, are re-e&s;tabli&s;hed;
but are forbidden to deliberate or vote on the affairs of &s;tate
or the operations of government. 5. Some additional powers
are granted to the thirty-&s;ix adjuncts, which increa&s;e their
importance, and con&s;equently the weight of their repre|&s;entations.
6. All per&s;ons bani&s;hed by the edict of 1782
are to be recalled, if the con&s;ent of France, Berne, and
Zuric can be obtained; and tho&s;e who were deprived of
their burgher&s;hip, on account of refu&s;ing to take the oath
of allegiance to the government e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1782, are to
be rein&s;tated in their rights.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="161">
IN return for the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions on the part of the magi|&s;trates,
the popular party con&s;ent to the articles in the edict
of 1782, which aboli&s;hed the right of re-election, and tran&s;|ferred
the right of repre&s;entation to the thirty-&s;ix adjuncts.
They have acted wi&s;ely in renouncing the right of re-election,
that &s;pecies of o&s;traci&s;m, and &s;ource of &s;o
much jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion, which principally occa&s;ioned
the troubles that preceded the revolution of 1782. They
have no le&s;s prudently con&s;ented to aboli&s;h the right of re|pre&s;entation,
as it was ve&s;ted, before the edict, in every
citizen and burgher. The u&s;e, or rather the abu&s;e, of this
right, occa&s;ioned frequent tumults and &s;editions, by the
promi&s;cuous a&s;&s;embling of a large number without order;
and it was found to be a dangerous expedient to employ a
multitude as an engine for political purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>BY the edict of 1782 it was &s;tipulated, in favour of the
natives, that during the term of ten years, five natives, and
after the expiration of the &s;aid term, three natives, &s;hould
be annually cho&s;en burghers. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion a
farther clau&s;e was added in their favour; that the burgher|&s;hip
&s;hould be conferred on all natives of the fourth gene|ration,
when they &s;hall have attained their proper age.</P>
<P>TIME can only di&s;cover whether the pre&s;ent form of
government will be more permanent than the former con|&s;titution;
or whether a few years may not bring about
another revolution. It bears, however, &s;trong marks and
characters of permanency, if we may augur from the pre|&s;ent
temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the parties. The alterations
<PB N="152" REF="162">
are ju&s;t, rea&s;onable, and even nece&s;&s;ary. It is the fir&s;t time
that all the orders of the &s;tate freely, and as it were unani|mou&s;ly,
con&s;ented, and that &s;carcely the lea&s;t di&s;affection or
murmurs have followed. The revolution of 1768 was the
triumph of the popular over the ari&s;tocratical party; and of
1782, the &s;till greater triumph of the ari&s;tocratical over the
popular party. But the pre&s;ent change of the government
was accompanied and followed by the triumph of neither
party. It was formed by the coalition of both; it was the
general &s;en&s;e of the whole republic united, in order to repeal
what experience had &s;hewn to be defective and incon&s;i&s;tent
with republican freedom in the edict of 1782; and to retain
what experience had &s;hewn to be expedient and analogous
to the &s;pirit and principles of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE pacification was in&s;tantly followed by marks of cor|diality
and attention, between the individuals of two parties,
never before experienced. The &s;ons of the principal Nega|tives
have frequented the circles of the burghers; the ma|gi&s;trates,
who could not be reproached with any abu&s;e of
their power &s;ince the edict of 1782, obtained the confidence
of the people from the moment that they renounced the
&s;upport of a foreign garri&s;on quartered in barracks, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
their re&s;olution of entru&s;ting the pre&s;ervation of the
&s;tate, to the citizens, burghers, and natives.</P>
<P>NO monument of that military force, &s;o odious and yet
&s;o u&s;ele&s;s, will remain. The barracks of the town-hou&s;e are
already evacuated, and will be converted into a public li|brary;
the new barracks, built at an enormous expence, and
<PB N="153" REF="163">
more calculated for the garri&s;on of a powerful and de&s;potic
kingdom than for a &s;mall and free commonwealth, will form
a building for the univer&s;ity. The reformation of the
&s;tudies, which have &s;carcely received any alteration &s;ince the
time of Calvin, is now in agitation. In a word, all things
&s;eem at pre&s;ent to con&s;pire for the general good; and it is to
be hoped that both parties, &s;hocked at the recollection of
pa&s;t troubles, will continue on as friendly terms as the
jealous nature of a free con&s;titution will admit, and not
exhibit any more civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions of &s;uch notoriety as to en|danger
the ruin of the republic; di&s;&s;en&s;ions which have
been hitherto, perhaps, almo&s;t unavoidable, but which, if
renewed in future, will &s;tamp indelible di&s;grace on the
Genevans, as a re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;contented people.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 67.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GENERAL REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in the cour&s;e of my former letters, commu|nicated
to you &s;uch ob&s;ervations as occurred to me
during my tour through Switzerland, concerning the laws,
government, and &s;ituation of each canton in particular; I
will now lay before you a few concluding remarks, in rela|tion
to the &s;tate of that country in general.</P>
<P>NO part of Europe contains, within the &s;ame compa&s;s, &s;o
many independent commonwealths, and &s;uch a variety of
different governments, as are collected together in this re|markable
and delightful country: yet, with &s;uch wi&s;dom
was the Helvetic union compo&s;ed, and &s;o little have the
Swi&s;s, of late years, been actuated with the &s;pirit of con|que&s;t,
that &s;ince the firm and complete e&s;tabli&s;hment of
their general confederacy, they have &s;eldom found occa&s;ion
to employ their arms again&s;t a foreign enemy; and have
been troubled with no civil commotions that were not &s;oon
happily terminated. Perhaps there is not a &s;imilar in&s;tance
in antient or modern hi&s;tory, of a warlike people, divided
into little independent republics, clo&s;ely bordering upon
each other, and occa&s;ionally interfering in their re&s;pective
intere&s;ts, having continued, during &s;o long a period, in an
almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;tate of tranquillity. And thus, while
the &s;everal neighbouring kingdoms &s;uffer, by turns, all the
<PB N="155" REF="165">
horrors of war, this favoured nation enjoys the felicity
of looking down with &s;ecurity upon the various tempe&s;ts
that &s;hake the world around them.</P>
<P>BUT the happine&s;s of a long peace, has neither broken
the &s;pirit, nor enervated the arm of the Swi&s;s. The youth
are diligently trained to martial exerci&s;es, &s;uch as running,
wre&s;tling, and &s;hooting with the cro&s;s-bow and the mu&s;ket;
a con&s;iderable number of well-di&s;ciplined troops are always
employed in foreign &s;ervices; and the whole people are en|rolled,
and regularly exerci&s;ed in their re&s;pective militia.
By the&s;e means they are capable of collecting a very re|&s;pectable
body of forces, which would prove formidable to
any enemy who &s;hould invade their country, or attack their
liberties. Thus, while mo&s;t of the other &s;tates upon the
continent are tending towards a military government, Swit|zerland
alone has no &s;tanding armies; and yet, from the
nature of its &s;ituation, from its particular alliances, and
from the policy of its internal government, is more &s;ecure
from inva&s;ion than any other European power.</P>
<P>THE felicity of Switzerland, however, does not con&s;i&s;t
merely in this peculiar exemption from the burdens and
mi&s;eries of war; as there is no country in which happine&s;s
and content more univer&s;ally prevail among the people.
For, whether the government is ari&s;tocratical, democratical,
or mixed; a general &s;pirit of liberty pervades and actuates
the &s;everal con&s;titutions: even the oligarchical &s;tates, which
are u&s;ually the mo&s;t tyrannical, are here peculiarly mild;
<PB N="156" REF="166">
and the property of the &s;ubject is in general &s;ecurely guarded
again&s;t every kind of violation.</P>
<P>BUT one general defect prevails in the criminal juri&s;pru|dence
of the country. For although the Caroline code, as it
is &s;tyled, or the code of the Emperor Charles the Fifth,
forms in each of the republics the principal ba&s;is of their
penal laws, with particular modifications and additions in
different di&s;tricts; yet much too great a latitude is allowed to
the re&s;pective judges, who are le&s;s governed in their deter|minations
by this code, or any other written law, than by
the common principles of equity. How far long experience
may have ju&s;tified the prudence of tru&s;ting them with this
extraordinary privilege, or how far the &s;everity of the
Caroline code renders it nece&s;&s;ary, I canot &s;ay; but di&s;|cretionary
powers of this kind, are undoubtedly liable to
the mo&s;t alarming abu&s;e, and can never, without the greate&s;t
hazard, be committed to the hands of the magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>UPON this occa&s;ion, I cannot forbear reflecting on the
&s;uperior wi&s;dom of our mo&s;t invaluable con&s;titution; and,
indeed, it is impo&s;&s;ible for an Engli&s;hman to ob&s;erve the
governments of other countries, without becoming a warmer
and more affectionate admirer of his own. In England, the
life and liberty of the &s;ubject does not depend upon the
arbitrary deci&s;ion of his judge, but is &s;ecured by expre&s;s
laws, from which no magi&s;trate can depart with impunity.
This guarded preci&s;ion, it is true, may occa&s;ionally be
attended with &s;ome inconveniences; but they are overba|lanced
<PB N="157" REF="167">
by advantages of &s;o much greater weight, as to be
&s;carcely perceptible in the &s;cales of ju&s;tice. I do not mean
to throw any imputation upon the officers of criminal juri&s;|diction
in Switzerland: as far as I could ob&s;erve, they admi|ni&s;ter
ju&s;tice with an impartial and equitable hand.</P>
<P>I REMARKED, with peculiar &s;atisfaction, the excellent
&s;tate of the pri&s;ons, and the humane precautions which the
&s;everal legi&s;latures have adopted in relation to felons: a cir|cum&s;tance
that &s;truck me the more forcibly, as the con|trary
is but too vi&s;ible in England. In Switzerland, the cri|minals
are confined in whole&s;ome and &s;eparate wards; and
in&s;tead of langui&s;hing in pri&s;on, to the great injury of their
health, or total wa&s;te of their little remnant of money, are
almo&s;t immediately brought to trial. In England, an accu&s;ed
per&s;on may be confined &s;ix months, or more, before his fate is
determined: and if he is proved innocent, and &s;hould be in
low circum&s;tances; the lo&s;s of his time, together with the
expences of the jail-fees, may probably occa&s;ion his utter
ruin; while his morals are in no le&s;s danger, by being com|pelled
to a&s;&s;ociate with a &s;et of abandoned wretches, lo&s;t to
all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, and encouraging each other in their
common profligacy. How much is it to be regretted, that,
while our code of criminal juri&s;prudence is in general
formed upon principles, which di&s;tingui&s;h us with honour
among the nations of Europe; that our courts of ju&s;tice are
thrown open to the view of all the world; and that we en|joy
the ine&s;timable and almo&s;t peculiar privilege of being
tried by our equals; how much (I cannot forbear repeating)
is it to be lamented, that the &s;ame equitable and humane
<PB N="158" REF="168">
&s;pirit &s;hould be found wanting in &s;o important an article of
our penal laws! For a more particular account of the pri&s;ons
in Switzerland, I would refer you to my friend Mr. Howard's
publication<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The State of the Pri&s;ons in England and Wales, &amp;c. &amp;c. Third edition, 1784. And an account of &s;ome foreign pri&s;ons.</NOTE> on the &s;ubject. In this work the benevolent
author has given many melancholy in&s;tances, that the En|gli&s;h
jails are much inferior to foreign pri&s;ons in cleanline&s;s
and good government. He mu&s;t, however, feel the mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ible &s;atisfaction in finding, that his labours have already
produced &s;everal advantageous regulations, particularly con|cerning
the fees of pri&s;oners who &s;hall be acquitted, and the
prevention of the jail di&s;temper. And although much &s;till
remains to be effected, yet it may ju&s;tly be hoped, that the
attention of the Briti&s;h Senate will be effectually fixed upon
an object &s;o highly de&s;erving the care of every wi&s;e and
humane legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>IT is a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, as well as of concern, to
find, that in a country where the true principles of civil go|vernment
are &s;o well under&s;tood, and &s;o generally adopted
as in Switzerland, that the trial by torture is not yet abo|li&s;hed:
for, in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, the &s;u&s;pected crimi|nal
is &s;till put to the rack. The inefficacy, no le&s;s than
the inhumanity, of endeavouring to extort the truth by the
&s;everal horrid in&s;truments which too ingenious cruelty has
devi&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, has been &s;o often expo&s;ed by the
able&s;t writers, that it would be equally impertinent and &s;u|perfluous
to trouble you with any farther reflections upon
the &s;ubject: and, indeed, the whole &s;trength of the &s;everal
<PB N="159" REF="169">
arguments urged upon this occa&s;ion, is compri&s;ed in the
very ju&s;t and pointed ob&s;ervation of the admirable la Bru|yere,

but add, in ju&s;tice to the Swi&s;s, that zealous advocates have
not been wanting among them for the total abolition of tor|ture;
but arguments of rea&s;on, and &s;entiments of humanity,
have been found, even in this civili&s;ed and enlightened coun|try,

<P>The pre&s;ent king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;et the ex|ample, in Germany, of aboli&s;hing this in|human practice; but few, perhaps, are ap|pri&s;ed, that the fir&s;t hint of this reformation was &s;ugge&s;ted to him by reading the Hi&s;tory of England. For, one of the principal ar|guments in &s;upport of this method of ex|torting confe&s;&s;ion, being, that it affords the be&s;t means of di&s;covering plots again&s;t government; the &s;agacious monarch re|marked, that the Briti&s;h annals fully con|fute the fallacy of that rea&s;oning. Few kingdoms, he ob&s;erved, had abounded more in con&s;piracies and rebellions than England; and yet the leaders and abettors had been more &s;ucce&s;sfully traced and di&s;covered, without the u&s;e of torture, than in any coun|try where it was practi&s;ed. &startq;<HI>From thence,</HI>&endq; added this wi&s;e politician, &startq;<HI>I &s;aw the ab|&s;urdity of torture, and aboli&s;hed it accord|ingly.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>This anecdote, which I received from very re&s;pectable authority, bears the mo&s;t honour|able te&s;timony to the efficacy as well as the mildne&s;s of our penal laws, and to the &s;u|perior excellency of the proce&s;s ob&s;erved in our courts of criminal ju&s;tice.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING my &s;ub&s;equent expeditions into Switzerland in
1785 and 1786, I was extremely happy to find, that the ab&s;urd|ity
as well as inhumanity of torture was more generally ad|mitted.
It has long been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in Geneva; in many of

the ari&s;tocratical cantons it is virtually, though not formally,
abandoned; and, as I have before had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Letter 56.</NOTE>,
its public abolition in Berne forms a di&s;tingui&s;hed aera in the
hi&s;tory of Swi&s;s juri&s;prudence, and, it is to be hoped, is the
prelude to its total di&s;u&s;e throughout Switzerland.</P>
<P>LEARNING is le&s;s generally diffu&s;ed among the catholic
than the prote&s;tant &s;tates: but in both a man of letters will
find abundant opportunities of gratifying his re&s;earches and
improving his knowledge. To the natural philo&s;opher,
Switzerland will afford an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of entertain|ment
and information, as well from the great variety of phy|&s;ical
curio&s;ities &s;o abundantly &s;pread over the country, as
from the con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons eminently &s;killed
in that branch of &s;cience. Indeed in every town, and al|mo&s;t
in every village, the curious traveller will meet with
collections worthy of his attention.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to agriculture; there are, perhaps, few
countries, wherein the advantageous effects of unwearied
and per&s;evering indu&s;try are more remarkably con&s;picuous.
In pa&s;&s;ing over the mountainous parts of Switzerland, I was
&s;truck with admiration and a&s;toni&s;hment, to ob&s;erve rocks,
that were formerly barren, now planted with vines, or
abounding in rich pa&s;ture; and at marking the traces of the
plough along the &s;ides of the &s;teepe&s;t declivities. In a
word, the inhabitants &s;eem to have &s;urmounted every ob|&s;truction
of &s;oil, &s;ituation, and climate; and to have &s;pread
<PB N="161" REF="171">
fertility over various &s;pots, which nature &s;eemed to have
con&s;igned to everla&s;ting barrenne&s;s. In fine, a general &s;im|plicity
of manners, an open and unaffected frankne&s;s, toge|ther
with an invincible &s;pirit of freedom, may ju&s;tly be

OF FUENTES&mdash;LAGHETTO DI CHIAVENNA&mdash;ENTRANCE
INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE GRISONS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Chiavenna, <DATE>July 21&s;t 1779.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I travelled over part of Switzerland, it has been
my de&s;ire to make a tour through the remainder of that
country, particularly to vi&s;it the Gri&s;ons; and, being now on
my return to England, I &s;hall take this opportunity of
indulging my curio&s;ity, and propo&s;e to my&s;elf the &s;atis|faction
of continuing to &s;end you, on this as on the former
occa&s;ion, all the information I am able to procure.</P>
<P>I QUITTED Milan la&s;t week, and proceeded through a
gently ri&s;ing country, well wooded and fertile in corn and
vines, to Como. This town being the birth-place of Pliny
the younger, the inhabitants have placed his &s;tatue in a
niche on the out&s;ide of the church, with a Latin in&s;cription
bearing the date of 1499. I need not remind you, with how
much rapture and enthu&s;ia&s;m Pliny mentions the delightful
&s;ituation of his native town, and the romantic &s;cenery of the
environs, in tho&s;e letters, of which you have given to the
public &s;o accurate and elegant a tran&s;lation.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="178">
COMO is indeed mo&s;t plea&s;antly &s;ituated, in a narrow vale,
enclo&s;ed by fertile hills, upon the &s;outhern extremity of the
beautiful lake which bears the &s;ame name. The town is
&s;urrounded by a wall defended with picture&s;que towers, and
backed by a conical eminence, on which &s;tand the ruins of
an antient ca&s;tle. The hou&s;es are neatly built of &s;tone; and
the cathedral is a hand&s;ome edifice of white marble, hewn
from the neighbouring quarries. The inhabitants have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
&s;everal manufactures of cotton and &s;ilk, and carry
on &s;ome trade with the Gri&s;ons.</P>
<P>FROM Como I made an excur&s;ion to Mendri&s;io, one of the
Italian bailliages belonging to the<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Appenzel is excluded from the co|regency becau&s;e the ce&s;&s;ion was made in 1512, the year before that republic was ad|mitted into the Helvetic confederacy. Be|&s;ide Mendri&s;io and Balerna, the other Italian bailliages are Locarno, Lugano, and Val-Maggia. Uri, Schwetz, and Underwal|den, po&s;&s;e&s;s three bailliages, Bellinzona, Riviera, and Val-Brenna, which were equally di&s;membered from the Milane&s;e.</NOTE> twelve cantons of Swit|zerland.
The&s;e bailliages formed part of the Milane&s;e, and
in 1512 were ceded to the cantons by Maximilian Sforza,
who was rai&s;ed to the ducal throne by the Swi&s;s, after they
had expelled the troops of Louis the Twelfth, and taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the duchy. Francis the fir&s;t, &s;ucce&s;&s;or of
Louis, having recovered the Milane&s;e, and &s;ecured his con|que&s;t
by the victory of Marignano, purcha&s;ed the friend&s;hip
of the Swi&s;s by confirming their right to the ceded terri|tory;
a right which the &s;ub&s;equent dukes of Milan have
been too prudent to di&s;pute.</P>
<P>MENDRISIO and Balerna is one of the &s;malle&s;t of the&s;e
tran&s;alpine bailliages: the bailif or governor is appointed
<PB N="171" REF="179">
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively by each of the twelve cantons, and remains in
office two years. He is &s;upreme judge in<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In ca&s;e of capital puni&s;hment, he is obliged to con&s;ult the &s;ecretary, notary, and the other officers of the di&s;trict; but as they have no vote, his power is &s;upreme.</NOTE> criminal affairs
without appeal: a power too great to be entru&s;ted to a
&s;tranger, commonly ignorant of the laws, and intere&s;ted to
increa&s;e his revenue. In civil cau&s;es an appeal lies to the
&s;yndicate of Switzerland. The inhabitants enjoy con&s;iderable
privileges, civil, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and commercial. The di&s;trict
is extremely fertile in vines, corn, and pa&s;turage; and yields
a great quantity of excellent &s;ilk.</P>
<P>UPON my return to Como, I embarked upon the lake.
The banks near the town are richly wooded, and &s;tudded
with country hou&s;es and &s;mall villages, which lie upon the
gentle acclivities near the margin of the water. At fir&s;t the
lake is &s;carcely a quarter of a mile broad, but it widened as
we turned round a neck of land upon which is &s;ituated the
&s;mall village of Turnio. The neighbourhood of Turnio,
and the di&s;tricts bordering the lake of Como, &s;upply, for the
mo&s;t part, tho&s;e Italian emigrants who wander through
Europe vending barometers and thermometers; of whom
numbers annually re&s;ort to England.</P>
<P>AFTER about an hour's rowing we came to Pliniana,
remarkable for a &s;ingular fountain, which is &s;till to be &s;een
in the &s;ame &s;tate as de&s;cribed by Pliny. Pliniana, a villa
belonging to a Milane&s;e nobleman, is con&s;tructed upon the
edge of the water, in a mo&s;t romantic &s;ituation, backed by
<PB N="172" REF="180">
rocks covered with trees and pa&s;ture. The ma&s;ter of the
hou&s;e received me with much civility and politene&s;s, and
kindly accompanied me to the fountain. It is a &s;pring,
which bur&s;ts from the rock clo&s;e to the hou&s;e, and falls in
natural ca&s;cades into the lake. I examined &s;ome of the
phaenomena alluded to in the following de&s;cription, and re|ceived
the others from the gentleman him&s;elf, who had re|peatedly
made them the &s;ubject of his ob&s;ervation. The
&s;pring ebbs and flows three times a day: this increa&s;e and
decrea&s;e is regular, excepting in bad weather. In the late
&s;ea&s;on, which has been remarkably fair, its changes were
more vi&s;ible than u&s;ual. From being almo&s;t dry, it gradu|ally
ri&s;es, until it forms a con&s;iderable &s;tream; and then as
gradually &s;ub&s;ides, till the period of its &s;well returns. I &s;aw
it in its flow, and mea&s;ured its increa&s;e by placing &s;tones at
different di&s;tances, all of which it reached and covered in a
&s;mall &s;pace of time. The original pa&s;&s;age, in which Pliny
de&s;cribes the ebb and flow of this &s;pring, is written upon the
wall of an adjoining apartment.</P>

videas<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin. Epi&s;t.</HI> lib. iv. Ep. xxx.&mdash;&startq;There is a &s;pring which ri&s;es in a neighbouring mountain; and running among the rocks is received into a little banquetting-room, from whence, after the force of its cur|rent is a little re&s;trained, it falls into the Latian lake. The nature of this &s;pring is extremely &s;urprizing; it ebbs and flows regularly three times a day. The in|crea&s;e and decrea&s;e is plainly vi&s;ible, and very entertaining to ob&s;erve. You &s;it down by the &s;ide of the fountain, and whil&s;t you are taking a repa&s;t and drinking its water, which is extremely cool, you &s;ee it gradually ri&s;e and fall. If you place a ring, or any thing el&s;e at the bottom when it is dry, the &s;tream reaches it by degrees till it is entirely covered, and then again gently retires from it; and if you wait you may &s;ee it thus advance and recede three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively.&endq; <HI>Melmoth's Tran&s;lation.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING gratified my curio&s;ity at Pliniana, I embarked,
and continued to Clarice, where I pa&s;&s;ed the night. The
weather, which has lately been uncommonly &s;ultry, is &s;ud|denly
changed; and this morning a violent thunder-&s;torm
overtook us upon the lake. The water being &s;o much
agitated, that we could not proceed without danger, we
landed at a &s;mall village upon the we&s;tern &s;ide of the lake,
until the &s;torm &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide. The navigation of the&s;e
lakes, which are enclo&s;ed between the mountains, is oc|ca&s;ionally
dangerous, according to Virgil's de&s;cription of the
Benacus, or Lago di Guarda:
<Q><L>Tu, Lari maxime, tuque</L>
<L>Fluctibus et fremitu a&s;&s;urgens, Benace, marino.</L></Q>
Travellers who have vi&s;ited the&s;e parts in calm weather are
apt to con&s;ider &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as exaggerated; but I am
convinced, from the &s;torm to which I have ju&s;t been wit|ne&s;s,
that &s;uch a de&s;cription is con&s;onant to truth.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="182">
THE lake of Como is about thirty-&s;ix miles in length, in
general from two to three miles broad, and four at the wide&s;t
part, where it is divided into two branches. The great
branch leads directly to Como; and the &s;maller branch,
called the lake of Lecco, di&s;charges the Adda, and commu|nicates,
by means of that river and the canals<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 88.</NOTE> of the Adda
and the Canale Vecchio, with Milan. The borders are high
hills covered with vines, Spani&s;h che&s;nut, walnut, and
almond trees, and dotted with numerous villages and &s;mall
towns. The hills which bound the lake ri&s;e gradually higher
and higher, from tho&s;e which encircle Como to the crags
which tower near its upper extremity.</P>
<P>THE &s;torm at length &s;ub&s;iding, I embarked, and proceeded
to Bellano, who&s;e &s;treets are &s;o narrow as &s;carcely to admit
the &s;malle&s;t cart. It is &s;ituated at the foot of a lofty pre|cipice,
rent from top to bottom by a cha&s;m, through which
a furious torrent forces its way. A bridge is thrown acro&s;s
the cha&s;m, from whence the &s;pectator looks down with
terror into a gulph &s;carcely inferior in depth to that at the
Panton-bruck<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 6.</NOTE>, in the canton of Glarus; and an aqueduct
is conducted along the precipitous &s;ides of the rock. I again
embarked, and proceeding to Doma&s;io, at Bellano waited
upon the governor, in order to obtain his permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it
the Fort of Fuentes: my reque&s;t being readily complied with,
I cro&s;&s;ed the lake, accompanied by a &s;oldier from Doma&s;io,
and landed at Collico.</P>
<P><PB REF="183">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="184">
A LITTLE above Doma&s;io, on both &s;ides of the lake,
begins the <HI>malaria,</HI> or unwhole&s;ome air. In the&s;e parts the
borders of the lake are no longer abrupt hills ri&s;ing boldly
from the edge of the water; but a flat-&s;wamp, which was
formerly covered with water. The inhabitants are &s;ubject
to intermitting fevers; on which account, during the heats
of &s;ummer, when the malignity of the atmo&s;phere is at its
height, the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants quit the plain,
and retire to the neighbouring mountains. We found
Collico and its neighbourhood almo&s;t entirely de&s;erted; the
cottages were &s;hut up; and, had it not been for the appear|ance
of a &s;traggling man and woman, we &s;hould have con|cluded
this part of the country to have been quite unin|habited.
After walking about two miles from Collico, we
came to the bottom of the rock, upon which &s;tands the Fort
of Fuentes. But before we a&s;cend, let me detain you a
moment with a &s;hort hi&s;tory of this fort, which at the begin|ning
of the la&s;t century was &s;o much celebrated in the
annals of Europe.</P>
<P>ONE of the articles in a treaty between Francis Sforza,
Duke of Milan, and the Gri&s;ons, expre&s;sly &s;tipulating that
no fort &s;hould be con&s;tructed in the di&s;trict of <HI>Piantedio,</HI>
was confirmed by the Spani&s;h branch of the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria, which &s;ucceeded Charles the Fifth in the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the Milane&s;e. Notwith&s;tanding, however, this agree|ment,
when the religious di&s;putes, occa&s;ioned by the intro|duction
of the reformed religion into the Valteline, had
created a jealou&s;y between the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and the
Gri&s;ons, and affairs &s;eemed tending to a rupture; the count
de Fuentes, governor of Milan, laid, in 1603, the foundation
<PB N="176" REF="185">
of the fort, which he called after his own name, and &s;aw it
completed in 1606. From this place, &s;ituated in the <HI>Pian|tedio,</HI>
he introduced troops into the Valteline, and &s;upported
the inhabitants in their ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Gri&s;ons.
Henry the Fourth of France, alluding to the con&s;truction
and &s;ituation of this fort upon the borders of Italy, and near
the confines of the Gri&s;ons, u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>Il veut du m&ecirc;me noeud
&s;errer la gorge de l'Italie et les pieds aux Gri&s;ons</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">With the &s;ame knot he binds the neck of Italy and the feet of the Gri&s;ons.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF you are not fatigued with this preliminary account,
we will now mount to the fort, and take a view of its pre&s;ent
&s;tate. It is built upon an in&s;ulated rock, about a mile and
a half from the neare&s;t ridge of mountains, and two miles
from the lake, &s;o that it completely commands the only
great opening which leads into the Valteline, either from the
Milane&s;e or the Gri&s;ons; a &s;ituation of great importance,
when the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Valteline was an object of &s;uch
con&s;equence to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The fortifications,
which are only a quarter of a mile in circumference, are
con&s;tructed with &s;tone, and are very &s;trong. The only
buildings are a few ruinous barracks for &s;oldiers, and the
governor's hou&s;e, which is in the mo&s;t wretched condition.
The whole garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of three &s;oldiers, who at the ex|piration
of three days, return to Doma&s;io, and are relieved
by an equal number from the &s;ame place. The only in|habitants
are a pea&s;ant and his wife, who have re&s;ided there
a year, and have been almo&s;t con&s;tantly afflicted with the
ague.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="186">
THE plain below the rock being entirely mar&s;hy and cover|ed
with ru&s;hes, exhales a pe&s;tilential effluvia, which infects the
atmo&s;phere, and occa&s;ions the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the fort.
The Spaniards were accu&s;tomed to &s;tyle this place, from its
peculiar &s;ituation, the <HI>yoke</HI> of the Gri&s;ons; while the Gri&s;ons,
in allu&s;ion to its bad air, termed it, with more propriety, the
<HI>grave</HI> of the Spaniards. The view from the fort is remark|ably
fine and picture&s;que. On one &s;ide, the rich Valteline,
watered by the turbulent Adda; on the other, by the lakes of
Como and Chiavenna, beautifully encircled with numerous
town villages. The hills which &s;kirt the Valteline and the lake
of Como pre&s;ent a variegated land&s;cape of fore&s;ts, corn-fields,
and pa&s;tures, finely contra&s;ted, towards the Gri&s;ons, by the
rugged Rhetian Alps covered with eternal &s;now.</P>
<P>HAVING taken leave of the three &s;oldiers, and bade adieu
to the pea&s;ant and his wife, I de&s;cended into the plain: the
&s;oil of which is fertile, but being &s;ubject to frequent inunda|tions,
is not capable of con&s;tant cultivation. That part
which lies between the fort and the lake is &s;o mar&s;hy, that
although the &s;trait line to the place, where the boat waited
for me, &s;carcely exceeded two miles, yet I was obliged to make
a circuit of five before I arrived. In my way, I pa&s;&s;ed a
range of &s;quare &s;tones, which form the boundary between
the Milane&s;e and the country of the Gri&s;ons; on one &s;ide of
each &s;tone was in&s;cribed <HI>Stato di Milano,</HI> on the other <HI>Gri|gioni:</HI>
they were put up, as the date informed me, in 1763,
the year in which the treaty, or the <HI>capitulation</HI> of Milan,
was concluded between the Empre&s;s of Germany, as &s;ove|reign
of Milan, and the Gri&s;ons. By this treaty the limits of
<PB N="178" REF="187">
the two &s;tates were finally &s;ettled, and &s;everal other &s;ubjects
of di&s;pute were amicably adju&s;ted. I came to the Adda,
which, for a &s;hort &s;pace, makes the line of &s;eparation be|tween
the Milane&s;e and Gri&s;ons, and walked along its banks.
Its &s;tream is muddy, and navigable only by rafts. Mo&s;t of
the maps of the lake of Como are erroneous, in repre&s;enting
that lake and the <HI>Laghetto</HI> di Chiavenna as one great piece
of water, and the Adda as flowing into the former; whereas
the two lakes are di&s;tinct, and the Adda joins a &s;mall &s;tream
which i&s;&s;ues from the <HI>Laghetto,</HI> and thus united falls into the
lake of Como.</P>
<P>I EMBARKED near Dacio, which is the la&s;t village in the
Milane&s;e; at which place all boats laden with merchan|di&s;e
are obliged to land, and pay a &s;mall duty. Soon after|wards
I entered the lake of Chiavenna, which belongs
to the Gri&s;ons. The views of this lake are extremely wild
and magnificent; &s;urrounded as it is with barren rocks,
craggy, and ri&s;ing into &s;pires &s;prinkled with &s;now: the
ba&s;es of tho&s;e dreadful precipices are lo&s;t in the dead and
over&s;hadowed water, dangerous on account of its malignant
vapours, and affording no &s;helter, &s;carcely a landing-place,
to the crews of tho&s;e frail boats, which are caught unwarily
in the violent &s;torms to which it is &s;ubject. I landed at
Riva, which con&s;i&s;ts of a few &s;cattered cottages and ware|hou&s;es,
the mi&s;erable owners whereof are the only inhabi|tants,
and having procured &s;ome hor&s;es, proceeded to Chia|venna
by moon-light. The villages were almo&s;t entirely de|&s;erted,
and the inhabitants withdrawn to the mountains.
The people in general are &s;o greatly alarmed at the un|whole&s;ome
<PB N="179" REF="188">
&s;tate of the air in this &s;ea&s;on, that the water|men
who rowed me from Como, although exceedingly
fatigued, went back to Doma&s;io; and exerted all their elo|quence
to di&s;&s;uade me from my fir&s;t intention of remaining
in the plain: overcome by their repeated importunities, I
pur&s;ued my journey to Chiavenna. Indeed, no other proof
of the tainted air is requi&s;ite than a view of the inhabitants;
the few pea&s;ants whom I met in the villages, as well near the
Fort of Fuentes as in the valley of Chiavenna, were mo&s;tly
wan and livid. The narrow valley through which I pa&s;&s;ed
from the lake to Chiavenna, is enclo&s;ed between the fir&s;t
and lowe&s;t chain of the Rhetian Alps; it is watered by the
torrent Maira, and produces Turki&s;h wheat, pa&s;turage, che&s;|nuts,
and mulberry-trees, together with a great abundance
of willows. Near Chiavenna the a&s;cent is rapid, and that
town is built in a higher and more whole&s;ome &s;ituation.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PLURS&mdash;ITS DESTRUCTION IN THE LAST CENTURY
BY A FALL OF A MOUNTAIN&mdash;VALLEY OF PRE|GALIA.</HEAD>
<P><DATE>July 25th.</DATE></P>
<P>MY la&s;t letter left me at Chiavenna, of which town I
defer &s;ending you any de&s;cription, as I propo&s;e re|turning
there in my way to Coire. The morning after my
arrival, I rode about four miles, to the &s;pot formerly occu|pied
by the town of Piuro, or Plurs, which was totally over|whelmed
by the fall of mount Conto, under which it was
built. This terrible cata&s;trophe happened Augu&s;t 25th,
1618.</P>
<P>PLURS was a large and flouri&s;hing town, &s;ubject, as well
as Chiavenna, to the Gri&s;ons. Contemporary writers men|tion,
that it contained three churches, many large hou&s;es,
and a &s;tone bridge over the Maira; and that its population
amounted to at lea&s;t 1500 inhabitants, who carried on no
incon&s;iderable commerce. The valley in which it was &s;itua|ted
is very narrow, and the whole town was buried in one
undi&s;tingui&s;hed ruin. A contemporary account relates,
that the cloud of du&s;t and rubbi&s;h was &s;o great as to cover
the heavens like &s;moke, and even to extend as far as Chia|venna:
the inhabitants of Chiavenna, alarmed at this un|common
phenomena, were &s;till more terrified at the di&s;ap|pearance
<PB N="181" REF="190">
of the torrent Maira, which cea&s;ed to flow by that
town for near an hour; its cour&s;e being &s;topped by the fal|len
fragments of rock, until it forced its way over the ruins.
This event &s;pread &s;uch an univer&s;al alarm among the inha|bitants,
from an apprehen&s;ion that the torrent had under|mined
Chiavenna, and would bur&s;t out with &s;uch fury as to
deluge the whole place, that great numbers precipitately fled
into the mountains.</P>
<P>I WALKED over the &s;pot where Plurs was built: parts of
the antient walls, and the ruins of a country hou&s;e, which
belonged to the Franci, the riche&s;t family in the place, are
the only remains of its former exi&s;tence; and the&s;e would not
be noticed by a pa&s;&s;enger. A pea&s;ant, who has a cottage clo&s;e
to the ruins, pointed out to me every place, as it had been ex|plained
to him by his grandfather. He &s;hewed me where
&s;tood the churches and principal hou&s;es, the channel
through which the river then flowed, and where the bridge
was con&s;tructed. He informed me, that in digging, &s;everal
dead bodies had been found; and particularly the bones of
a prie&s;t, covered with &s;hreds of garments, which indicated
that he was employed in divine &s;ervice when the rock over|whelmed
the town. Hou&s;hold uten&s;ils are frequently dug up;
the other day &s;everal corp&s;es were di&s;covered, and on the finger
bone of one were a &s;ilver and two gold rings. Vineyards, che&s;|nut-trees,
and hou&s;es, cover the &s;pot where this unfortunate
town was once &s;ituated. The valley in this part has an oval
appearance, and is &s;kirted by a beautiful grove of che&s;nut-trees;
the &s;urrounding mountains are &s;teep and rugged, and
from the top of mount Savonne, <HI>l'acqua fragia,</HI> a con&s;ider|able
<PB N="182" REF="191">
torrent, precipitates it&s;elf, at fir&s;t in a full unbroken
&s;tream, and afterwards divides into three &s;eparate falls,
highly ornamental to the beautiful &s;cenery of the vale.</P>
<P>THE guide conducted me to the hou&s;e of a gentleman
near Chiavenna, in order to &s;ee a drawing of Plurs before
it was overwhelmed; the ance&s;tors of this per&s;on had large
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and were the riche&s;t family in the town. The
ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e &s;hewed me the picture, and explained to
me the &s;ituation of the different buildings. He then politely
accompanied me through his grounds to a manufacture of
&s;tone pots called <HI>Lavezzi,</HI> which are made near Chiavenna,
and are much u&s;ed for kitchen uten&s;ils throughout the&s;e
countries, and &s;ome parts of Italy. This manufacture
is very antient: Pliny mentions the &s;tone<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lapis Ollaris.</HI>&mdash;Pliny's <HI>Lapis Comen&s;is</HI> is cla&s;&s;ed by Wallerius among the &s;teatites, by Linnaeus among the tales.&mdash;It is opake, unctuous to the touch, and compo&s;ed of mica and &s;teatites. When it is fir&s;t taken from the quarry it is ea&s;ily cut and turned; on being expo&s;ed to the air it hardens, but will take no poli&s;h.</NOTE> under the deno|mination
of <HI>Lapis Comen&s;is,</HI> becau&s;e the pots were &s;ent to
Como and there exported. The&s;e uten&s;ils are made by the
following proce&s;s: the workmen hew from the quarry &s;emi|circular
blocks of &s;tone, from which, with an in&s;trument re|&s;embling
that u&s;ed by turners, they hollow a ve&s;&s;el about a
foot in diameter. From the ma&s;s which remains, by a &s;imi|lar
mode of proceeding, they frame another uten&s;il of infe|rior
dimen&s;ions, and continue their operation till they have
produced a &s;eries of &s;emicircular pots, gradually decrea&s;ing
to the &s;ize of a &s;mall ba&s;on. From Plurs I continued along
the valley of Santa Croce, and entered the country of the
Gri&s;ons at the &s;mall village of Ca&s;ta Segna, in Pregalia.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="192">
AT Bondo, which is a &s;mall village in the valley of Pre|galia,
Count de Salis, formerly Briti&s;h envoy to the Gri&s;ons,
has con&s;tructed a large and commodious hou&s;e, and entirely
fitted up in the Engli&s;h ta&s;te. It is &s;ituated at the extremity
of a &s;mall plain &s;carcely half a mile in length, and about four
hundred paces broad, bounded on each &s;ide by a chain of the
Rhetian Alps, who&s;e &s;ides are covered with fore&s;ts intermixed
with luxuriant pa&s;ture. The plain is &s;hut in by &s;ome rugged
rocks, behind which others &s;hoot to an enormous height,
crowned with perpetual &s;now. The little plain produces ex|cellent
pa&s;ture, barley, rye, vegetables of all &s;orts, and
&s;ome fruit-trees. Through it da&s;hes the torrent Maira
over broken fragments of rock.</P>
<P>I RAMBLED about the valley of Pregalia and the neigh|bouring
mountains; and ob&s;erved the dome&s;tic oeconomy
of the pea&s;ants. Their chief food is &s;alt meat, rye bread,
milk, chee&s;e, polenta, and che&s;nuts, which are &s;o plentiful at
this &s;ea&s;on of the year, that they make a principal ingredient
in all their meals: the mo&s;t common methods of dre&s;&s;ing
them are to boil, and &s;erve them up with crumbs of bread;
or to grind them to a pa&s;te, and then heat them with &s;ome
milk. The pea&s;ants are well clothed. They manufacture
linen and coar&s;e cloth at home, every family having a
loom, which is worked in the winter &s;ea&s;on. The finer
cloth, which they wear only on Sundays and fe&s;tivals, is
procured from Germany.</P>
<P>THE valley of Pregalia reaches from the Pode&s;teria of
Plurs to the con&s;ines of Upper Engadina, and contains
about 1800 inhabitants: it is a high juri&s;diction in the league
<PB N="184" REF="193">
of God's Hou&s;e, and is divided into the two independent com|munities
of <HI>Sopra</HI> and <HI>Sotto Porta;</HI> &s;o denominated from a
wall with an opening called <HI>Porta,</HI> through which the road
pa&s;&s;es, and which &s;eparates the valley into two equal parts.
The&s;e two communities enjoy a democratical form of
government: a &s;hort account of which will convey to you
&s;ome idea of the mode in which the admini&s;tration of affairs
is carried on in the&s;e little &s;tates.</P>
<P>EACH community has its general a&s;&s;embly, in which the
&s;overeign power is ve&s;ted; every male at the age of eighteen
has a vote: in each of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies the magi&s;trates and
repre&s;entatives to the general diet are cho&s;en by the majo|rity
of voices; in&s;tructions are given to the repre&s;entatives;
and all appeals from the diet decided in the la&s;t re&s;ort. For
civil cau&s;es, the two communities have &s;eparate tribunals,
compo&s;ed of the <HI>Landamman,</HI> who is pre&s;ident, and twelve
a&s;&s;i&s;tants; and an appeal lies from one to the other. For
criminal affairs, there is one court of ju&s;tice, compo&s;ed of a
<HI>Pode&s;ta,</HI> and an equal number of judges from each community.
The Pode&s;ta is cho&s;en in the following manner: each com|munity
appoints two per&s;ons, who nominate nine others;
and the&s;e nine chu&s;e two candidates, who draw lots for the
office. The &s;ame per&s;on is not unfrequently nominated Po|de&s;ta
by both parties; and then the lot is ca&s;t, to a&s;certain to
which he belongs. This criminal court of ju&s;tice is always
held at Vico Soprano, in Sopra Porta. In all delinquencies the
puni&s;hments are extraordinarily &s;evere, and the remi&s;&s;ion or
alleviation is entirely left to the judges, who generally take a
commutation in fines; &s;o that if the criminal is poor, he under|goes
the puni&s;hment; if rich, he redeems him&s;elf by money.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 70.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">DESCRIPTION OF THE MARMOT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Marmot is extremely common in the mountains
of Switzerland, and particularly in this part of the
Gri&s;ons; and, as many erroneous accounts of this &s;agacious
little animal have been given, I &s;hall &s;end you the following
extract, &s;elected from a de&s;cription written in the German
tongue, by Dr. Girtaner<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A French tran&s;lation of this account is given in Rozier's Journal for 1786.</NOTE>; which cannot fail being highly
intere&s;ting to all, who love to &s;earch into the oeconomy of
nature.</P>
<P>DOCTOR AMSTEIN, of Zitzers, in the country of the Gri|&s;ons,
is the fir&s;t naturali&s;t who has narrowly inquired into
the oeconomy of the marmot. Since his de&s;cription of this
animal in profe&s;&s;or Schreber's work, he has him&s;elf made
&s;everal new ob&s;ervations, and obtained additional informa|tion
from Me&s;&s;rs Aporta and Catani, two clergymen of the
Gri&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE marmot inhabits the highe&s;t and mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible
mountains; prefers the &s;mall narrow valleys, and particu|larly
the we&s;tern or &s;outhern a&s;pect, as the warme&s;t, and
<PB N="186" REF="195">
avoids moi&s;t places. On the opening of &s;pring, when he
i&s;&s;ues from his hole, where he has &s;lept during winter, he
de&s;cends to the lower regions, where vegetation is forward.
In &s;ummer he again a&s;cends to the rocky heights, and into
&s;olitary caverns. He feeds upon herbs and roots, and par|ticularly
on the alpine plantain, mountain &s;pignel, alpine
ladies mantle, mountain &s;orrel, alpine toad-flax, alpine tre|foil,
and alpine &s;tarwort<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Plantago alpina, Phellandrium mutellina, Alchemilla alpina, Rumex digynus, Antirrhi|num alpinum, Trifolium alpinum, A&s;ter alpinus.</NOTE>. When tame, he eats almo&s;t
every thing except fle&s;h. On drinking, he rai&s;es up his
head like fowls at every &s;ip, looking on each &s;ide with a
timorous watchfulne&s;s. He drinks but little, to which
Dr. Am&s;tein attributes his fatne&s;s. He is extremely fond of
butter and milk.</P>
<P>AT break of day the old marmots come out of their holes
and feed; afterwards they bring out their young ones; the
latter &s;camper on all &s;ides, cha&s;e each other, &s;it on their hind
feet, and remain in that po&s;ture, facing the &s;un, with an air
expre&s;&s;ive of &s;atisfaction. They are all particularly fond of
warmth, and when they think them&s;elves &s;ecure, will ba&s;k
in the &s;un for &s;everal hours. Before they collect the gra&s;s,
either for their food, or for their winter habitations, they
form them&s;elves into a circle, &s;itting on their hind legs, and
reconnoitre on all &s;ides. On the lea&s;t alarm, the fir&s;t gives
in&s;tantly a &s;hrill cry, which is communicated from one to
the other, and they e&s;cape without repeating the noi&s;e.
<PB N="187" REF="196">
The cha&s;&s;eurs, by imitating the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive whi&s;tlings, ap|proach
&s;o near as to come within &s;hot of them. The marmot
has a quick eye, di&s;covers the enemy at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance, and flies when he is pur&s;ued. When apprehen&s;ive
of being followed, whole families quit their dwellings, and
wander from mountain to mountain, although they mu&s;t
again con&s;truct their habitations: but when flight is impo&s;|&s;ible,
they defend them&s;elves with &s;pirit again&s;t men and
dogs, and attack all who approach them with their teeth
and claws.</P>
<P>THEY always live together in &s;ocieties. They have both
&s;ummer and winter dwellings, which are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed.
The former remain open during the whole year; whereas the
latter are clo&s;ed at the end of September. In the &s;ummer
dwellings is found dung in great abundance, but no hay: on
the contrary, the winter habitations never contain any dung,
but much hay. Near the latter is perceived a more con&s;ider|able
quantity of earth, which annually increa&s;es according to
the &s;ize of the dwelling, and the augmentation of the family.
In the formation of their dwellings they &s;coop out the earth
with great dexterity and expedition: a &s;mall part they throw
away, and by beating the remainder clo&s;e, render the pa&s;&s;age
very compact and &s;olid. The opening being &s;carcely more
than &s;ix or &s;even inches in diameter, is ju&s;t large enough to
admit the animal. The interior is from eight to twenty feet
in length; it con&s;i&s;ts of a pa&s;&s;age, which at about five or &s;ix
feet from the entrance, divides into two branches: the one
leading to a &s;mall cavity; the other to the chamber in
<PB N="188" REF="197">
which they repo&s;e. The pa&s;&s;age, and two branches, are al|ways
carried in a &s;traight line, unle&s;s the intervention of a
rock, or any other impediment, obliges them to take
another direction. The chamber is round or oval, arched
at top, and in its form re&s;embles the &s;hape of an oven. It is
from three to &s;even feet in diameter, being larger or &s;maller
according to the number of the family. It is &s;trewed with
hay, in which the marmots lie in a dormant &s;tate during
the whole winter.</P>
<P>ON retiring to this dwelling about the beginning of
October, they carefully clo&s;e the entrance &s;o as to exclude all
air, with a cement of earth mixed with &s;tones and hay.
On opening this chamber three weeks after it is clo&s;ed,
the marmots are di&s;covered lying on the hay clo&s;e to each
other, and rolled up like hedge-hogs, without the lea&s;t ap|pearance
of life. U&s;ually from five to &s;ixteen are found
together; &s;ometimes, but rarely, two families occupy the
&s;ame dwelling; and occa&s;ionally, but very &s;eldom, one has
been di&s;covered alone. If expo&s;ed to warmth they awaken.
The tame marmots do not &s;leep during winter; but on the
approach of that &s;ea&s;on, excited by in&s;tinct, they collect ma|terials
towards con&s;tructing their dwellings. The wild mar|mots
occupy their winter habitation in October, and quit it
towards the latter end of March or the beginning of April.
In removing the cement which clo&s;es the opening, they do

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PASSAGE OF THE MALLOGGIA&mdash;LAKE OF SIGLIO&mdash;SELVA
PIANA AND ST. MOREZZO&mdash;EXPEDITION
TO THE JULIAN COLUMNS&mdash;BEVIO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>St. Morezzo, <DATE>July 31&s;t.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE road through Pregalia to Coire admits carriages,
but is very indifferently paved. I pa&s;&s;ed through
the village Promontogno, then through the Porta, to Stam|pa,
Vico-Soprano, Borgo, Nuovo, and Ca&s;aucia. The hou&s;es in
this valley are of &s;tone, pla&s;tered and white-wa&s;hed; they are
not &s;cattered, as in the &s;mall cantons of Switzerland; but
every half mile a clu&s;ter of habitations pre&s;ents it&s;elf.</P>
<P>BEYOND Bondo the country produces no more che&s;nut-trees,
but principally larch and firs; it yields gra&s;s, barley,
and rye. Near Ca&s;aucia is the barren and lofty mountain of
Set. I here quitted the high road, which turns towards
Coire, and about a mile and a half further the valley ter|minates,
and began to mount a very &s;teep a&s;cent, by the &s;ide
of the torrent Maira, which ru&s;hes amid&s;t a fore&s;t of firs;
it de&s;cends from the glacier of the Malin, a ridge of Alps
&s;eparating the Valteline from the country of the Gri&s;ons. A
little further I reached the top of the Malloggia, and ob&s;erved
the Orlenga, a gli&s;tening torrent, falling from the Lungin
mountain, and forming the remote&s;t &s;ource of the Inn.
The Malloggia is the point of partition, dividing the waters
<PB N="191" REF="200">
which run towards the Black Sea, from tho&s;e which flow
into the Adriatic. The tops of the circumjacent mountains
are mo&s;tly rugged, and covered with &s;now: lower down
they are enlivened with under-wood, firs, and pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>I STOPPED at a &s;ingle hou&s;e, a kind of inn, where travel|lers
are accommodated. The landlord and his family &s;peak
an Italian jargon, &s;imilar to the Milane&s;e dialect, which is
common in Pregalia. The next place is Siglio in Upper En|gadina,
where Roman&s;h is the general tongue. On in|quiring
whether it was &s;imilar to the Italian &s;poken in
Pregalia, the landlord informed me, that the two languages
are totally different; and the &s;ervant a&s;&s;ured me, that &s;he
could &s;carcely comprehend a word which was uttered by the
inhabitants of Siglio. From Malloggia I de&s;cended, and
cro&s;&s;ed the Orlenga, and continued along the banks of the
lake of Siglio. The way was bad and craggy until I came
to the con&s;ines of Engadina, where an excellent road com|menced.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall lake of Siglio is about five miles in circum|ference,
and is finely &s;ituated between high perpendicular
rocks. It takes its name from Siglio, which we left at
a little di&s;tance on our right. I cro&s;&s;ed the Inn &s;oon after
it i&s;&s;ues from the lake, and pur&s;ued my cour&s;e over the
dry bed of the torrent Fait, which formerly flowed into the
Inn; but has lately changed its cour&s;e, and now falls into
the lake of the Selva Piana. Nothing is more common than
for the&s;e torrents to &s;hift their channels; and I could ob&s;erve
evident traces, that &s;ome of them had at former periods
<PB N="192" REF="201">
watered the &s;mall plain between the lakes of Siglio and Selva
Piana. The village of that name &s;tands plea&s;antly upon a
&s;mall ri&s;ing ground; and the lake of Selva Piana, though
much &s;maller than that of Siglio, far &s;urpa&s;&s;es it in the
beauty of its banks, which are fringed with hanging groves
of fir and larch. From this lake the Inn i&s;&s;ues in a
larger &s;tream, falls again at a little di&s;tance into the lake of
St. Morezzo; from whence it da&s;hes through a deep rocky
channel into the plain of Celerina, where it runs in a more
tranquil current. The&s;e little plains, or valleys, are broader
and longer than that of Bondo, and produce as much gra&s;s,
which is now mowing.</P>
<P>AT Selva Piana, I attempted to conver&s;e with &s;ome of the
inhabitants, but could &s;carcely comprehend them. I have
been endeavouring al&s;o to talk with the inhabitants of this
place. Many &s;peak Italian, as it is much frequented by
&s;trangers for the &s;ake of the waters; but the greate&s;t part
could talk nothing but Roman&s;h. This morning being Sun|day
I attended divine &s;ervice; the clergyman preached in the
language of the country, and I could under&s;tand little more
than that the text was in the 22d chapter of St. Luke. The
&s;ermon, which is the principal part of the &s;ervice, was about
an hour long; the prayers are very &s;hort; the girls &s;ung
p&s;alms; &s;ome of them had delightful voices, and performed
with great ta&s;te and propriety: a proof of their neighbour|hood
to Italy.</P>
<P>ST. MOREZZO, or as it is mo&s;t commonly called St. Mau|rice,
&s;tands agreeably upon the &s;ide of an hill, and overlooks
<PB N="193" REF="202">
a &s;mall lake, which lies in the bo&s;om of the mountains, and
is bounded by ri&s;ing banks, &s;tudded with wood and pa&s;ture.
It is a village in Upper Engadina, and is remarkable for a
plentiful &s;pring of mineral water, much e&s;teemed for its
efficacy in curing &s;everal di&s;orders. It i&s;&s;ues from the
ground, about the di&s;tance of half a mile on the other &s;ide
of the river Inn; is a very plentiful &s;ource, and &s;trongly
impregnated with vitriol. Upon plunging Reaumur's ther|mometer
into the &s;ource, it &s;unk from 12 to 4 &frac12;. I was in|formed
that a gentleman had lately a&s;certained, from re|peated
ob&s;ervations, that the thermometer varied according
to the greater or le&s;s degree of rain; but that upon an
average the mercury generally &s;tood between 4 and 7.</P>
<P>I AM lodged in one of the boarding hou&s;es, which abound
in this place, for the accommodation of per&s;ons who drink
the waters. The company at table con&s;i&s;t, at pre&s;ent, of
only two merchants of Appenzel, who are e&s;tabli&s;hed at
Genoa, and a clergyman of Lower Engadina. As I &s;oon
di&s;covered the clergyman to be an intelligent man, I
held frequent conver&s;ation with him upon the Roman&s;h
tongue; but defer enlarging upon that &s;ubject until I &s;hall
have gained further information. I al&s;o talked with him
upon the &s;tate of religion among the reformed part of the
Gri&s;ons, and particularly in relation to the <HI>Pieti&s;ts,</HI> a &s;ect
which has lately made great progre&s;s in the&s;e parts. From
the account given by the clergyman, who evidently leaned
towards their opinions, the&s;e Pieti&s;ts appear &s;imilar to our
Methodi&s;ts: for in&s;tance, they exalt faith above good works,
affect to be uncommonly rigid and pious, condemn all diver|&s;ions,
<PB N="194" REF="203">
card-playing, and a&s;&s;emblies, as criminal; frequently
de&s;pair of their &s;alvation, fancy vi&s;ions, enjoy &s;upernatural
inward illuminations, and employ &s;o much time in prayer
as to neglect their ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s. The clergymen of
this &s;ect are for the mo&s;t part ignorant and &s;uperficial, are
vehemently vociferous in the pulpit, thunder out reproba|tion,
and expatiate upon ju&s;tification, without explaining the
methods of avoiding the one, and of obtaining the other.
The&s;e preachers, notwith&s;tanding their affectation of a total
indifference to worldly matters, do not confine their views
merely to theological &s;peculations, but pay a con&s;iderable
degree of attention to political affairs: and as, by means of
their authority in religious concerns, they po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;ider|able
influence over the votes of their pari&s;hioners, they are
on that account much care&s;&s;ed and countenanced by &s;everal
leading per&s;ons among the Gri&s;ons. In the&s;e parts the dre&s;s
of the women is &s;ingular, and not unbecoming: it con&s;i&s;ts
of a black or blue jacket with red &s;leeves, &s;triped blue and
white petticoats, a &s;mall black velvet cap trimmed with gold
or &s;ilver lace, with a black or white lace border hanging
over the forehead.</P>
<P>I MADE an excur&s;ion to the Julian Columns, of which
Scheuzer has given a de&s;cription and an engraving in his
<HI>Itinera Alpina:</HI> he &s;uppo&s;es them to have been erected by
Julius Cae&s;ar, in order to mark the limits of his conque&s;ts in
the&s;e parts; and a&s;&s;erts that, <HI>Ne plus ultra,</HI> and <HI>Omitto Rhetos
indomitos,</HI> are in&s;cribed upon them. From St. Morezzo I
went to Selva Piana, then turned up a path which leads
to the Julian Alps, and after continuing about two hours
<PB N="195" REF="204">
over rugged rocks, reached the Julian columns, if they de|&s;erve
&s;o dignified an appellation. They are of a circular
&s;hape, &s;omewhat &s;imilar to the Roman mile-&s;tones, placed
at the di&s;tance of about forty-feet from each other. Their
height above the ground is about four feet, and they &s;eem
to be buried about a foot, or &s;carcely &s;o much: their cir|cumference
is about five feet. They have neither pede&s;tals
nor capitals, and are flatti&s;h at top, with a &s;mall round
hole in the middle about four inches diameter and &s;ix deep.
They were formed by art, but in the rude&s;t manner. I exa|mined,
with great attention, if I could ob&s;erve the in&s;criptions
of <HI>Ne plus ultra,</HI> and <HI>Omitto Rhetos indomitos,</HI> but I could
not di&s;cover the &s;malle&s;t traces of any letters. We have no
rea&s;on therefore to conclude, that the&s;e pillars were erected
by Julius Cae&s;ar in order to a&s;certain the boundary of his
conque&s;ts, or at lea&s;t we have no proofs upon which we can
depend for the truth of this popular &s;tory: I do not how|ever
regret, that I made the excur&s;ion; for although my
curio&s;ity has been di&s;appointed in a view of the pillars, yet it
has been gratified in vi&s;iting the&s;e wild and romantic alps.
The Julian Alps produce much pa&s;ture, but no wood, which
is a proof of their great elevation. Near the &s;tones ju&s;t now de|&s;cribed
is a piece of water called the Julian lake: it is &s;upplied
from a glacier on a &s;uperincumbent mountain, and &s;ends forth
a torrent that de&s;cends to Selva Piana, and falls into the lake
of that name: it may be con&s;idered as a &s;ource of the Inn.</P>
<P>I SOON afterwards &s;topped at a cottage, the only hou&s;e
in the whole extent of the&s;e Alps: it is occupied only during
&s;ummer; the tenants every night hou&s;e the cattle that graze
<PB N="196" REF="205">
upon the&s;e mountains, and make large quantities of butter
and chee&s;e. Having taken a refre&s;hing bowl of thick cream,
I began my de&s;cent, and ob&s;erved numerous &s;mall &s;treams;
&s;ome i&s;&s;uing from rocks, others falling from the glaciers,
and forming the fir&s;t &s;ources of the Little Rhine. The path
was &s;o &s;teep and craggy, that I gave my hor&s;e to the guide,
and preferred walking. About five miles from the pillars, I
arrived at Bevio, a &s;mall village upon the Little Rhine, in the
high road which leads to Coire. Every one being employed
in hay-making, I could not gain admittance into the inn: &s;ome
friars, however, offered me their hou&s;e and dinner, and pre|vented
me from returning to the cottage upon the Julian
Alps. On que&s;tioning the&s;e friars concerning the con&s;titution
of the Republic of Bevio; they informed me, that Bevio and
Valmorara form one community, governed by eleven magi|&s;trates,
though the number of voters who appoint the&s;e ma|gi&s;trates
&s;carcely exceeds forty: the chief is called <HI>Mini&s;trale,</HI>
and is confirmed every year; for which act of politene&s;s
each voter annually receives a florin. About one-third of the
merchandi&s;e from Como to Coire pa&s;&s;es by Bevio, but the
greate&s;t part is &s;ent by Splugen. After dinner I returned
over the Julian Alps to St. Morezzo.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Zutz, <DATE>Augu&s;t 2d.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE ride from St. Morezzo to Zutz, through Celerina,
Samada, Ponto, and Madulein, is extremely plea&s;ant.
The&s;e villages lie chiefly upon the &s;ides of the mountains
gently ri&s;ing above a plain, which in &s;ome parts is a mile
broad, in others &s;o narrow as to be entirely occupied by the
river Inn. The valley is enclo&s;ed on both &s;ides by a chain
of alps, covered for a con&s;iderable height with wood inter|&s;per&s;ed
with pa&s;ture, and their tops capped with &s;now. The
river, which in this part is free from cataracts, is joined by
innumerable torrents, that ru&s;h down the &s;ides of the rocks,
or bur&s;t from the ground.</P>
<P>THE Inn, during its progre&s;s in this part, is very unlike
mo&s;t of the rivers which I traced in my former tour. The
Rhone, the Reu&s;s, and the Aar, for in&s;tance, fall, near
their &s;ources, in a continual cataract, over fragments of rock,
and through the mo&s;t wild and uninhabited tracts of country;
while this river directs its cour&s;e through a cultivated and
populous di&s;trict, in an equable unbroken &s;tream. The
country is picture&s;que, and its beauties are of a milder ca&s;t
than are u&s;ual in the&s;e Alpine regions. The burghs, or vil|lages,
are plea&s;antly dotted about the plain, at the di&s;tance of
<PB N="198" REF="207">
about a mile from each other. Each village contains about
fifty or a hundred hou&s;es, &s;tanding contiguous; the&s;e habi|tations
are of &s;tone pla&s;tered and white-wa&s;hed, and are in
&s;uch excellent repair, that they appear as if they had been
newly con&s;tructed. The &s;pirit of neatne&s;s indeed is &s;o gene|ral
in Upper Engadina, that I &s;carcely ob&s;erved one bad hou&s;e
through the whole di&s;trict; and even the barns are as good
as the cottages in many countries.</P>
<P>AS I was riding through Bever, the clergyman of that
place, who was &s;moking his pipe at his door, &s;topped me
with a compliment, and upon my entering into conver&s;ation
with him, invited me to &s;ee his library. I alighted accord|ingly,
and looked over his collection. He &s;hewed me &s;ome
Engli&s;h books, and many in the Roman&s;h language, particu|larly
the<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This Bible is in the dialect of the Grey League.</NOTE> Bible printed at Coire, which is dedicated to
George the Second when Prince of Wales. He was al&s;o
&s;o obliging as to accompany me a little way. About half a
mile from Bever he pointed out to me a &s;ingle hou&s;e called
Alles Angnes, where the deputies of the two communities of
Upper Engadina a&s;&s;emble for the purpo&s;e of deciding, in
the la&s;t re&s;ort, appeals in civil cau&s;es. A little further he
de&s;ired me to ob&s;erve a &s;mall &s;pring, which falls into the
Inn a few paces from its &s;ource. It is called Fontana Merla,
and would not, he added, be worthy of notice, if it did not
&s;eparate the two communities of Upper Engadina. Soon after|wards
I took leave of the clergyman, mounted my hor&s;e,
and proceeding to Zutz, pa&s;&s;ed the Inn &s;everal times, over
<PB N="199" REF="208">
bridges of &s;ingle arches, which have a very &s;triking ap|pearance.
They were con&s;tructed by &s;cholars of the fa|mous
Grubenman<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. Lett. 2. and 13.</NOTE>, and in the &s;ame &s;tyle of architecture as
the bridges of Schaffhau&s;en and Wettingen, excepting that
they are not covered.</P>
<P>ZUTZ, although not the large&s;t is e&s;teemed the principal
place of Upper Engadina, becau&s;e it contains the criminal
court of ju&s;tice. The Landamman of Sotto Fontana Merla,
who always pre&s;ides in this court, is cho&s;en every other turn
from the family of Planta, e&s;tabli&s;hed at Zutz: this peculiar
privilege, which gives to that family no incon&s;iderable
influence in the political affairs of this country, was for|merly
granted by a bi&s;hop of Coire, who was uncle to
one of the Plantas. Upon my arrival at Zutz, I waited
upon Mr. Planta, formerly Envoy from the Republic of
the Gri&s;ons to that of Venice; he was appointed to that
emba&s;&s;y in order to renew the antient league which for|merly
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two &s;tates, but which had been
interrupted by the la&s;t treaty of 1763, between the Empre&s;s
of Germany and the Gri&s;ons; on which occa&s;ion the Vene|tians
were &s;o much enraged, that they expelled the Gri&s;ons
from their territories. This negotiation, however, though
conducted with great ability, was ineffectual. Mr. Planta
received me with great politene&s;s and cordiality, and invited
me to &s;upper; and as the evening was not &s;et in, he accom|panied
me to what is called the camp of Dru&s;us, which I was
de&s;irous of examining.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="209">
YOU recollect the campaign which Dru&s;us, the adopted
&s;on of Augu&s;tus, and brother of Tiberius, carried on again&s;t
the fierce inhabitants of the&s;e mountainous countries; and
which Horace, in compliment to his patron, has alluded to
in the following pa&s;&s;ages:
<Q><L>Videre Rhaeti bella &s;ub Alpibus</L>
<L>Dru&s;um gerentem et Vindelici;</L></Q>
and afterwards,
<Q><L>&mdash;arces</L>
<L>Alpibus impo&s;itas tremendas</L>
<L>Dejecit acer plus vice &s;implici.</L></Q>
This campaign of Dru&s;us again&s;t the Rhetians was attended
with great &s;ucce&s;s, and he defeated the barbarous inhabi|tants,
before deemed unconquerable, (<HI>indomito&s;que Rhaetos</HI>)
with great &s;laughter. The &s;uppo&s;ed remains of his camp
con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal deep pits, and a mound of earth about
thirty feet high and &s;ixty paces in circumference. The&s;e
works did not appear to me to be of Roman con&s;truction;
probably they are nothing more than a rude fortification
thrown up during the turbulent times, when the barons
of the country were engaged in perpetual acts of ho&s;tility: a
de&s;ire to render them venerable by the remotene&s;s of their
origin, and the &s;plendour of the Roman name, &s;eems the
only cau&s;e of their being attributed to Dru&s;us. Having
&s;atisfied my curio&s;ity, I returned to Zutz, and pa&s;&s;ed an
agreeable evening with Mr. Planta.</P>

<P>THE little burghs in the&s;e parts are &s;ituated at &s;uch a
&s;mall di&s;tance from each other, that my daily journeys are
&s;carcely &s;o much as a morning's walk; and I am &s;o delighted
with the country and its inhabitants, that I could willingly
take up my abode here for &s;ome time longer. Upon my
arrival at Scampf, I carried a letter of recommendation
to Mr. Perini; who introduced me to Mr. Aporta, the
clergyman of the place. He is a native of Lower Engadina,
of the antient and illu&s;trious family of Aporta. He &s;tudied<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He received his education, I believe, in the Univer&s;ity of Ba&s;le.</NOTE>
&s;ome time at Deprezin, in Hungary; but returning to his
native country, was &s;oon afterwards appointed pa&s;tor of
Scampf. His income is &s;mall, &s;carcely amounting to &pound;. 20<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Con&s;idering the different modes of living, and different value of money, this &s;um is
perhaps equivalent to about &pound;. 60 in England.</NOTE>
per annum, and yet his living is e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t in
Engadina. With this moderate revenue he is able to main|tain
a wife and large family. His chief work, which is a
&s;ufficient proof of his exten&s;ive knowledge, and indefatigable
indu&s;try, is the Hi&s;tory of the Reformation among the
Gri&s;ons, in two volumes quarto. It is written in Latin, and
compiled with great impartiality and exactne&s;s. The &s;tyle is
cla&s;&s;ical and per&s;picuous. This excellent publication is not
merely confined to eccle&s;ia&s;tical tran&s;actions; for as the
affairs of religion are intimately blended with political
events, the latter make no incon&s;iderable figure in every
Hi&s;tory of the Reformation. The reader will find in Mr.
Aporta's performance a minute and faithful account of the
<PB N="202" REF="211">
animo&s;ities between France and Spain, in relation to the
Gri&s;ons; of the rebellion in the Valteline; of the ma&s;&s;acre
of the Prote&s;tants; and of the &s;ub&s;equent war carried on
under the &s;emblance of religion. This intere&s;ting narrative
comprehends almo&s;t all the important events in the hi&s;tory
of the Gri&s;ons, from the beginning of the reformation to the
peace of the Valteline.</P>
<P>I LOOK up with reverence to this learned author, for his
unwearied indu&s;try in completing &s;o laborious a work
with little encouragement, and under all the di&s;advantages
which ari&s;e from a difficulty of procuring books, and &s;trait|ened
circum&s;tances. All that he ever obtained, be&s;ide fame,
was a pre&s;ent of twenty-five guineas, which enabled him to
bear his expences to Zurich, for the purpo&s;e of collecting
materials from the manu&s;cripts in the public library. The
work, printed at Coire, at the expence of the typographical
&s;ociety, has never produced any emolument to the author.
This re&s;pectable divine, be&s;ide a critical knowledge of the
learned languages, under&s;tands and &s;peaks Italian and
German, is able to read French, and has &s;ome acquaintance
with the Hungarian and Wallachian tongues. During the
little time I pa&s;&s;ed in his company, I had frequent occa&s;ion
to be &s;urprized at his profound erudition and comprehen&s;ive
abilities; and I am particularly indebted to him for much
exact information concerning the Roman&s;h tongue, the
general purport of which I &s;hall tran&s;mit to you in a future
letter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Letter 90.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="212">
UPPER ENGADINA is divided into two communities,
called Sotto and Sopra Fontana Merla, from their &s;ituation
above or below that &s;pring. They have both the &s;ame court
of criminal ju&s;tice, which is held at Zutz, and con&s;i&s;ts of the
Landamman of Sotto, who is pre&s;ident, and &s;ixteen jurymen,
called Trouadors, taken equally from each di&s;trict. Ju&s;tice
is more equitably admini&s;tered in this court than in any other
throughout the Gri&s;ons, excepting at Coire; a circum&s;tance
which ari&s;es from the following cau&s;es. The code of cri|minal
laws was compo&s;ed in 1563 by one Juvalta, who had
been envoy from the Republic of the Gri&s;ons to Venice, and
had there imbibed more enlarged conceptions of juri&s;pru|dence,
than at that time prevailed among his rude country|men.
This excellent code was drawn up in Latin, and in
1644 was tran&s;lated into Roman&s;h. The fines enjoined for
criminal offences do not belong to the judges, but to the
community. The expences of the proce&s;s are defrayed, and
a &s;alary is allowed to the judges from the public fund: the
judges by the&s;e means, being not &s;o much intere&s;ted to con|vict
the pri&s;oner, are not &s;o ready to employ the horrid ex|pedient
of torture for the purpo&s;e of enforcing confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>ANOTHER cau&s;e of the equity ob&s;ervable in this court,
is the mode of electing the judges: they are not, as in many
of the other communities, cho&s;en by the people collectively
a&s;&s;embled, but by &s;ixteen deputies who repre&s;ent the &s;everal
di&s;tricts. By the&s;e means the election is carried on with more
prudence, and with a greater attention to the qualifications of
the judges, than can be expected amid&s;t the confu&s;ion of a po|pular
meeting. The &s;ame deputies chu&s;e all the civil magi|&s;trates
<PB N="204" REF="213">
by a majority of voices; and finally decide all legi&s;la|tive
and political que&s;tions, which have before been &s;eparately
propo&s;ed to the &s;everal di&s;tricts which they repre&s;ent. Their
con&s;tituents have the power (which they frequently exerci&s;e)
of peremptorily directing their vote. It is, however, no incon|&s;iderable
alleviation of the mi&s;chiefs frequently attendant on
governments purely democratical, that the whole body of the
populace on no occa&s;ion a&s;&s;emble upon one &s;pot, but di&s;cu&s;s
matters in detached parties, and &s;end the re&s;ult of their
deliberation by their repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>UPPER ENGADINA is a very beautiful valley, yet, on
account of its elevation, produces nothing but pa&s;ture and a
&s;mall quantity of rye and barley. The winter &s;ets in early
and ends late, during which time &s;ledges are the ordinary
vehicles. The air, even at the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, is cold and
piercing, and the corn in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer is occa|&s;ionally
much damaged by the hoar-fro&s;ts. Hence the
Italian proverb,
<Q><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Engadina would be a fine country if there was no fro&s;t.</NOTE>Engadina Terra Fina, &s;e non fo&s;&s;e la pruina.</Q></P>
<P>As the di&s;trict does not yield &s;ufficient productions for
the &s;u&s;tenance of the inhabitants, many of them migrate
into foreign countries; the gentry in the military line, as
is common through Switzerland; others in the capacity of
mechanics, trade&s;men, and merchants: their favourite oc|cupation
is to keep coffee-hou&s;es or pa&s;try-cook &s;hops in dif|ferent
<PB N="205" REF="214">
parts of Italy and France. Generally two per&s;ons enter
into partner&s;hip to carry on the &s;ame trade: one &s;tays in his
own country, and the other attends the bu&s;ine&s;s for a year,
when he is relieved by his partner, and returns to his family
for the &s;ame term. The&s;e partners are commonly as
faithful as they are indu&s;trious; they annually bring con|&s;iderable
&s;ums of money into this di&s;trict, which is e&s;teemed
the riche&s;t among the Gri&s;ons.</P>
<P>MANY of the inhabitants feed numerous herds of cattle in
the &s;ummer months upon the Upper Alps, and export large
quantities of chee&s;e and butter. In the autumn, when
pa&s;ture begins to be &s;carce, they &s;end great part of the cattle
for &s;ale into the Tyrol. The inhabitants live very much
upon &s;alted meat, particularly in winter, on account of the
dearne&s;s of fodder. The bread of the country is mo&s;tly
browni&s;h; it is baked in little round cakes, only two or three
times in the year, and becomes &s;o hard that it is &s;ometimes
broken with the hatchet; it is not an unplea&s;ant food with
chee&s;e or butter, which are very common. The greate&s;t
part of the butter is made on the Alps; it is afterwards
melted, put into bottles, and frequently continues good
during the whole year. The wine of the Valteline is much
e&s;teemed, and is by no means &s;carce in this country: it bears
keeping to a very con&s;iderable age. I have ta&s;ted &s;ome wine
from the ca&s;k, of a very fine flavour, above fifty years old,
although it grows &s;our in the &s;pace of three years in the
warm climate of the Valteline.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="215">
THE people are, for the mo&s;t part, remarkably polite
and well-bred; they bow to me as I pa&s;s with great civility,
and will perform any kind offices in the readie&s;t and mo&s;t
obliging manner. I am indeed no le&s;s delighted with the
manners of the inhabitants, their politene&s;s and ho&s;pitality,
than with the romantic &s;cenery of the country. Although
many of the natives &s;pend a great portion of their time in
foreign parts, they &s;eldom lo&s;e their attachment to Enga|dina;
and return with great eagerne&s;s to their family and
friends, after their occa&s;ional ab&s;ence. The inhabitants of
Upper Engadina are computed at about four thou&s;and, and
out of the&s;e, four or five hundred, upon an average, earn
their livelihood in foreign countries.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Cernetz, <DATE>Augu&s;t 4th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE valley of Upper Engadina, from Celerina to a few
miles beyond Scampf, is nearly level; it is enclo&s;ed
between two ridges of mountains, which are highe&s;t at Ce|lerina,
and gradually dimini&s;h in height and ruggedne&s;s.
About Zutz and Scampf is the fine&s;t part of the valley: it
there produces &s;ome rye and barley, and the mountains are
clothed with verdure to their very &s;ummits. Beyond Scampf
the plain ends; and the river Inn, which had hitherto
winded in a gentle cour&s;e, is contracted into a narrow chan|nel,
and falls in continual cataracts. The road a&s;cends and
de&s;cends along the &s;ides of the mountains: and the country
is thickly over&s;pread with woods of fir and pines.</P>
<P>I PASSED through &s;everal villages, &s;imilar to tho&s;e I have
de&s;cribed in the preceding letter; and near Brail I cro&s;&s;ed
a &s;mall bridge thrown over a precipice, and overlooking a
foaming cataract. This bridge is called in the language of
the country <HI>Pont Alta,</HI> or High Bridge, and forms the &s;epa|ration
between Upper and Lower Engadina. Even if the
limits of the two di&s;tricts had not been thus marked out, the
<PB N="208" REF="217">
&s;udden alteration of the road, for the wor&s;e, would have led
me to &s;u&s;pect that I had quitted Upper Engadina. The road
from the lake of Siglio to Pont Alta is like our turnpikes in
England, and &s;ufficiently broad to contain two or three car|riages
abrea&s;t; no common circum&s;tance in the&s;e moun|tainous
regions. It has been lately made, in con&s;equence of
a propo&s;al from the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, at the late treaty of
Milan, to improve the roads leading through the Pregalia
and the two Engadinas, in order that the merchandi&s;e to and
from Pregalia might be tran&s;ported this way through the
Tyrol, in&s;tead of being carried, as it is at pre&s;ent, through
Coire.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria offered to defray the whole ex|pence
of this undertaking. The inhabitants of Upper En|gadina,
although they declined, with a &s;pirit of di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s
rarely to be found in democratical &s;tates, the offer of
indemnification, immediately carried the plan into execution
within their own territories; but the intrigues of the citizens
of Coire, who&s;e intere&s;t would have greatly &s;uffered by the
new arrangement, together with an inveterate per&s;ua&s;ion,
that good roads would render the country too acce&s;&s;ible to the
neighbouring powers, prevented the people of Pregalia and
Lower Engadina from co-operating in this u&s;eful project;
accordingly that part of this road, which runs through their
di&s;tricts, remains in its original &s;tate. After cro&s;&s;ing Pont Alta,
I pa&s;&s;ed along a wild and almo&s;t uninhabited tract of fore&s;t
until I reached Cernetz, where I am now comfortably lodged
in the hou&s;e of Mr. Planta. That gentleman is at his govern|ment
of Morbegno, in the Valteline; but having accidentally
<PB N="209" REF="218">
met me at Chiavenna, kindly gave me a letter of recommen|dation
to his uncle, who would not permit me to continue
at the inn.</P>
<P>CERNETZ is &s;ituated in a &s;mall rich plain, bounded by
two ridges of mountains converging at both extremities.
This plain produces wheat, barley, rye, flax, and abundance
of rich pa&s;ture. I feel an e&s;&s;ential difference between the
climate of this little plain and that of Upper Engadina; it is
much warmer, and has all its natural productions much
farther advanced towards maturity. Large quantities of
wood are felled upon the&s;e mountains, and floated down
the Inn as far as In&s;pruck. In this plain the Inn is joined
by the large torrent Spaelg, that de&s;cends from the moun|tains
of Bormio. By the &s;ide of this torrent, and at the ex|tremity
of a narrow pa&s;s leading to Bormio and Mun&s;ter, I
ob&s;erved a &s;quare tower, which in 1624 the Marquis de
Caeuvres garri&s;oned with a body of French and Gri&s;on troops,
in order to check the motions of the Au&s;trian army po&s;ted
at Mun&s;ter. The pa&s;s is &s;till further fortified by a &s;tone
wall, carried from the foot of an inacce&s;&s;ible rock to the
tower, and from thence to the torrent.</P>
<P>THE Marquis de Caeuvres, to whom the guard of this
important pa&s;s was committed, was &s;on of the Marquis
d'Etr&eacute;es; he was bred up to the church, and created bi&s;hop
of Noyon; but upon the death of his elder brother re|nounced
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical line, and embraced the profe&s;&s;ion
of arms. He di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;everal campaigns
under Henry the Fourth, and was afterwards employed in
<PB N="210" REF="219">
the reign of Louis the Thirteenth as emba&s;&s;ador to Turin
and Rome. In 1624 he was appointed emba&s;&s;ador extraor|dinary
to the Republic of the Gri&s;ons, and commander in
chief of an army, compo&s;ed of French and Swi&s;s troops,
&s;ent to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Gri&s;ons during the war of the
Valteline. He penetrated through Coire into Lower En|gadina,
and &s;eized, without delay, the important pa&s;s ju&s;t
now de&s;cribed; by this manoeuvre he &s;ecured the only
avenue by which he could open a pa&s;&s;age to Bormio, the
reduction of which place was followed by an almo&s;t im|mediate
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Valteline. For the&s;e important
&s;ervices the Marquis, on his return to France, was created
Duc d'Etr&eacute;es, and rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t honours. He died
in 1670, in the 102d year of age.</P>
<P>I EMPLOYED the greate&s;t part of this morning in making
extracts from Campel's account of the Gri&s;ons, e&s;teemed the
be&s;t topographical and political hi&s;tory of this country yet
extant. It con&s;i&s;ts of three large folio volumes, and is
written in Latin. It has never been printed, and is very
rarely met with. I had the good fortune to find a copy in
the library of Count Firmian, at Milan, who with that rea|dine&s;s
to oblige, which peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed his cha|racter,
permitted me to con&s;ult it. My &s;tay at Milan being
very &s;hort, and employed in other re&s;earches, I had
not made &s;o good an u&s;e of this indulgence as I could
have wi&s;hed; and as I have now found the &s;ame work
in Mr. Planta's library, I embrace this opportunity of pe|ru&s;ing
the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts: it has given me a great
in&s;ight into the geography, hi&s;tory, and governments of
<PB N="211" REF="220">
this country, which are treated with the mo&s;t circum&s;tan|tial
accuracy.</P>
<P>HULDRIC CAMPEL, the author of this valuable work, was
born, in the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, at Su&s;s,
in Lower Engadina, and made a mo&s;t uncommon proficiency
in every &s;pecies of literature. He was one of the earlie&s;t re|formers
in this country, and became, by his active zeal, as
well as by his exten&s;ive erudition, a great in&s;trument in
&s;preading the reformation through this di&s;trict. An event
of &s;mall con&s;equence which happened in his family gave
ri&s;e to the &s;udden and wide di&s;&s;emination of the new doc|trines,
and ended in the abolition of the Roman Catholic
religion.</P>
<P>WHILE he was ab&s;ent, in 1537, upon the pro&s;ecution of
his &s;tudies, his wife was delivered of a daughter, which was
&s;o &s;ickly and weak, as to &s;eem upon the point of expiring.
Ga&s;par Campel, father of Huldric, a man &s;trongly attached to
the reformed doctrines, refu&s;ed to have the child chri&s;tened
by the Popi&s;h prie&s;t of the pari&s;h, nor would &s;uffer even the
midwives to &s;prinkle it, according to the cu&s;tom of the
Romi&s;h church, with holy water; and, as there was no
reformed mini&s;ter at hand, he performed the ceremony of
bapti&s;m him&s;elf. This act was looked upon in &s;o abominable
a light by the Roman Catholics of Su&s;s, that they a&s;&s;embled
in a tumultuous manner, and attacked Ga&s;par with &s;uch
fury, that he narrowly e&s;caped a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. His enemies
then brought an accu&s;ation again&s;t him before the diet,
which at fir&s;t referred the cau&s;e to arbitration; but no &s;atis|factory
<PB N="212" REF="221">
deci&s;ion being obtained from this mode of proceed|ing,
a public conference was ordered to be held in the church
of Su&s;s, before deputies from the &s;everal communities, upon
the following que&s;tion, &startq;Whether, if a child is born and
likely to die before a prie&s;t can be &s;ent for, the bapti&s;m per|formed
by a layman was preferable to that by midwives?&endq;</P>
<P>THIS ridiculous inquiry led to di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of great
moment. The reformed mini&s;ters refu&s;ed to acknowledge
any authority but that of the Holy Scriptures, while the
Catholics con&s;idered the writings of the fathers and decrees
of the church as infallible: each party, thus regarding every
point through a different medium, could never be prevailed
on to adopt the arguments of its antagoni&s;t; and the di&s;pute
la&s;ted &s;even days with little pro&s;pect of any &s;atisfactory con|clu&s;ion.
Fortunately, however, a &s;y&s;tem of accommodation,
which this endle&s;s mode of rea&s;oning could never even di&s;|tantly
promi&s;e, was &s;ummarily attained by the moderation of
the deputies. They decided, that in ca&s;es of extreme ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
where no prie&s;t was pre&s;ent, either a layman or the
midwives might bapti&s;e, and that the former was preferable
to the latter: but what was of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, they
inculcated this rational po&s;ition, that in regard to the other
controverted points of faith debated in the cour&s;e of the ar|gument,
every per&s;on might &s;afely hold that doctrine, which
from full conviction he was per&s;uaded to be the word of
God. This conference was productive of the mo&s;t beneficial
effects; for the people, who flocked thither in great num|bers,
were taught to con&s;ider the Holy Scriptures as the
only authority in controverted que&s;tions. The tendency
<PB N="213" REF="222">
of this maxim was obvious: in fact it produced &s;uch im|mediate
and rapid effects, that within the &s;pace of twenty
years the Reformation was completely e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout
Engadina<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Excepting the &s;mall village of Samun.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO return to Huldric Campel: he not only approved his
father's conduct in the affair of his daughter's bapti&s;m, but
became a zealous pro&s;elyte to the new doctrines. Having
entered into holy orders, he undertook the care of a re|formed
church in the valley of Pretigau, where he was in|defatigable
in the performance of his duty, and the propa|gation
of the Prote&s;tant religion. In 1550 he was drawn to
Su&s;s by the friends of the Reformation, as a per&s;on the mo&s;t
qualified to combat the Roman Catholic church. His labours
were attended with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that, a &s;hort time after his
appearance in his native place, ma&s;s was aboli&s;hed, and the
Reformation publicly adopted. Nor was Su&s;s the &s;ole thea|tre
of his exertions; at Cernetz, and &s;everal other places, the
per&s;ua&s;ion of his eloquence, and the force of his arguments,
gained a numerous train of converts. He pa&s;&s;ed the decline
of his life at Schlins, where he was pa&s;tor, and per&s;evered to
the la&s;t period of his exi&s;tence in di&s;&s;eminating and defend|ing
the doctrine of the reformed churches, as ably with his
eloquence as he recommended it by his example. Amid&s;t
the occupation of religious duties, he found lei&s;ure to con|tinue
his hi&s;tory of the Gri&s;ons to 1580. He died the fol|lowing
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Some authors place his death in 1582.</NOTE> years at Schlins, in an extreme old age, leaving a
<PB N="214" REF="223">
name highly re&s;pectable in the religious and literary annals
of this country.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of Campel con&s;i&s;ts of three volumes. The
fir&s;t dwells chiefly on the topography of the Gri&s;ons, and
de&s;cribes the different di&s;tricts and towns: it likewi&s;e deli|neates
the nature of the &s;everal governments, and the
various forms of civil and criminal juri&s;prudence in the
petty republics into which this country is &s;ubdivided. The
&s;econd volume compri&s;es the hi&s;tory of Rhaetia, from the
earlie&s;t period to the Suabian war in 1499, under the emperor
Maximilian I. The materials are chiefly drawn from
T&s;chudi, Stumpf, and other Swi&s;s hi&s;torians. The third
volume, in which the hi&s;tory is brought down to his own
times, is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and authentic. Campel hav|ing
&s;ubmitted his work to the examination and correction of
Bullinger and Simler, pre&s;ented, in 1577, a copy to the diet
of the three leagues, and received public thanks. But as
his own fortune was inadequate to the expences of publica|tion,
and as no book&s;eller would undertake to print &s;o volu|minous
a work, it has never been given to the world.</P>

<P>THE road from Cernetz to Scuol is a continual a&s;cent and
de&s;cent, and &s;o rocky and bad, that I employed above eight
hours in riding only twenty miles. The &s;mall plain of Cer|netz
&s;oon ends, and is &s;ucceeded by a rude a&s;&s;emblage of
rocks and fore&s;ts. Su&s;s is &s;ituated in a narrow pa&s;s between
the river Inn and a contiguous ridge of rocks a little beneath
the ruins of an old ca&s;tle: clo&s;e to it is a &s;mall fertile plain,
<PB N="215" REF="224">
which agreeably diver&s;ified the wildne&s;s of the rocks and
fore&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE road to Ardetz follows the cour&s;e of the Inn, which
murmurs below in a deep narrow channel, heard but not
&s;een. From Ardetz (over which hangs, upon a lofty rock, a
ruined ca&s;tle called Steinberg) I de&s;cended along a very &s;teep
craggy path to the river Inn, which I cro&s;&s;ed, and mounted a
rapid a&s;cent, leaving on my right hand the valley of
Scharla, in which there are &s;ilver mines belonging to the
Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria: they were formerly very rich, and yielded
a con&s;iderable advantage, but are now exhau&s;ted. I pa&s;&s;ed
through the &s;traggling village of Tra&s;p, and clo&s;e to a ca&s;tle
of the &s;ame name, &s;ituated upon the highe&s;t point of a per|pendicular
rock. Count Dietrich&s;tein, as lord of the ca&s;tle,
is a prince of the German empire: it was given to his family
by the emperor Leopold, on condition that its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or
&s;hould always vote in the diet of the empire for the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria. The formality of a garri&s;on is maintained in this
ca&s;tle by a &s;ingle Au&s;trian &s;oldier. From Tra&s;p I again
de&s;cended to the river, cro&s;&s;ed it, and a&s;cended to Scuol. I
arrived there very late, and &s;et off early this morning.</P>
<P>FROM Scuol to Remus the mountains on the left &s;lope
gradually, and are richly cultivated: they produce great
quantities of wheat, rye, barley, flax, and hemp: the trees
are chiefly pines, firs, and &s;mall birch, intermixed with
underwood of nut-trees and wild ro&s;es. The corn-fields are
rai&s;ed in gradations (if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf) along the
&s;ides of the hills, like the vineyards in the Pays de Vaud.
<PB N="216" REF="225">
The ridges of mountains on the right beyond the Inn are
&s;teep, and in many places perpendicular, with few appear|ances
of vegetation. It is now harve&s;t time: I have ob|&s;erved
&s;everal clergymen employed in reaping the corn.
The clergy are very poor in Lower Engadina, and are more
numerous than in any other part of the Gri&s;ons. The in|come
of the riche&s;t benefices amounts to about &pound;. 20 per an|num;
that of the inferior cures to little more than &pound;. 8; and this
&s;canty pittance is &s;ometimes &s;ubdivided among two or three
clergymen, or as many as happen to be unprovided for in
the &s;ame pari&s;h. I &s;topped at Remus to bait my hor&s;es. Near
it is a ruined ca&s;tle, which formerly belonged to the bi&s;hop
of Coire, and was given by one of the former bi&s;hops to the
Plantas of Zutz; in right of which donation they claim the
privilege of admini&s;tering the oath to the Landamman of
Sotto Ta&s;na. The only remains of this ca&s;tle are two &s;quare
towers, in one of which is a mi&s;erable apartment, where Mr.
Planta gives an annual dinner to the Landamman.</P>
<P>THE form of government in Lower Engadina is more
complicated than that of Upper Engadina, and it has co&s;t me
no &s;mall degree of pains to comprehend and unfold it. I
&s;hall not, however, trouble you with a circum&s;tantial account
of every particular which &s;truck me in the cour&s;e of this
inve&s;tigation, but &s;hall compri&s;e my account in as &s;hort a
compa&s;s as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>LOWER ENGADINA is divided into three communities,
which &s;end three deputies to the general diet. The fir&s;t
community is compo&s;ed of the pari&s;hes of Cernetz, Su&s;s,
<PB N="217" REF="226">
Lavin, Guarda, and Ardetz: The &s;econd compri&s;es Vettan,
Scuol, and Sent; and the third contains Remus, Schlins, and
Samun. The two former communities make one High
Juri&s;diction; and the third forms, with Bevio, Valmorara,
and Avers, another High Juri&s;diction. In civil cau&s;es there
are two &s;eparate courts of ju&s;tice, one for that part of the
country which lies to the north, the other for the di&s;|trict
to the &s;outh of the torrent Ta&s;na; from which tor|rent
the two parts are called Sopra and Sotto Ta&s;na:
from each of the&s;e courts there lies an appeal, in the la&s;t
re&s;ort, to the civil tribunal of Sotto Fontana Merla, in Up|per
Engadina, or to the neighbouring community of the
valley of Mun&s;ter. In criminal cau&s;es there are likewi&s;e two
di&s;tinct courts, but without appeal, one for the tract to the
north of the mountain Falon, another for the region to the
&s;outh: according to this divi&s;ion the two parts are denomi|nated
Sopra and Sotto Montfalon. By this complicated ar|rangement
Vettan is connected with Scuol and Sent in po|litical
concerns; in civil affairs with Scuol, Sent, Remus,
Schlins, and Samun; in criminal cau&s;es with Cernetz, and
the other towns of the fir&s;t community. This intermixture
of various intere&s;ts creates &s;uch an intricacy in the election
of deputies, magi&s;trates, judges, both civil and criminal, as
would be unintere&s;ting for me to detail, or for you to read.</P>
<P>ONE circum&s;tance, however, cannot fail to &s;trike the
mo&s;t inattentive inquirer; that although the mode of elect|ing
the judges is nearly the &s;ame with that of Upper Enga|dina,
yet that ju&s;tice is by no means &s;o impartially admini&s;|tered
as in the latter di&s;trict. I cannot forbear a&s;cribing this
<PB N="218" REF="227">
material difference in an affair of &s;uch importance to the dif|ferent
condition of the two people; the inhabitants of
Upper Engadina, being more enlightened and affluent than
their neighbours, are le&s;s open to the influence of illiberal
prejudices and petty corruption.</P>
<P>PARTY runs very high both in Upper and Lower Enga|dina:
there are &s;ome con&s;iderable families in the&s;e di&s;tricts,
of which the principal are tho&s;e of De&s;alis and Planta, both
&s;ubdivided into numerous collateral branches. The hi&s;tory
of this country is full of the di&s;putes and &s;truggles between
the&s;e rival hou&s;es, and pre&s;ents in many periods little more
than an uniform picture of dome&s;tic feuds. The two parties
are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellations of <HI>Scarbonada,</HI> black;
and <HI>Alba,</HI> white; the former devoted to the Plantas, the lat|ter
to the De&s;ali&s;es. At the time of elections for deputies
and magi&s;trates the inhabitants of Lower Engadina &s;eldom
ab&s;tain from blows, which not unfrequently terminate in
blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>I HAVE more than once had occa&s;ion to mention the &s;u|periority
of politene&s;s which di&s;tingui&s;hes the inhabitants
of Upper Engadina from tho&s;e of the lower di&s;trict. This
pre-eminence probably ari&s;es from the con&s;tant emigration
of the former into other countries, and their intercour&s;e with
foreigners. I find al&s;o a great difference in the comforts of
life in the two di&s;tricts. Although Lower Engadina pro|duces
nece&s;&s;aries abundantly &s;ufficient for interior con&s;ump|tion,
yet the inhabitants are le&s;s indu&s;trious, and con&s;e|quently
poorer. In Upper Engadina I was always able to
<PB N="219" REF="228">
procure at the commone&s;t inns fre&s;h meat, good oil, and ex|cellent
wine, none of which I could obtain in the lower di&s;|trict.
The villages are le&s;s commodious, and the hou&s;es of
the pea&s;ants are al&s;o far inferior in cleanline&s;s, neatne&s;s, and
convenience. This difference probably proceeds, in a cer|tain
degree, from the nature of the country: Upper En|gadina
yielding but few productions, the inhabitants are
obliged to &s;eek from without &s;ome means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence;
and indu&s;try once excited, brings with it its u&s;ual companion
opulence. On the contrary, the &s;oil of Lower Engadina,
fertile in all the fruits of the earth, lays the inhabitants
under no nece&s;&s;ity of extraordinary exertion, nor obliges
them to have recour&s;e to foreign trade.</P>

<P>IN my way from Remus to St. Martin's bridge, being
overtaken by a violent &s;torm of rain, I took &s;helter in a cot|tage;
and was cheerfully received by a well-looking old
woman; my hor&s;e was put under a &s;hed, and my&s;elf &s;afely
hou&s;ed from the pelting of the &s;hower. The hou&s;e was
perfectly neat and clean, with much better furniture and ac|commodations
than I expected from the external appearance.
The old woman talked, (be&s;ide the Roman&s;h) German and
Italian, and the latter remarkably well. The &s;torm con|tinuing
two hours without intermi&s;&s;ion, I held a long con|ver&s;ation
with her, and was greatly plea&s;ed with the polite
and ready manner with which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf upon
different topics. Upon taking leave, I made &s;everal apolo|gies
for having dirtied her hou&s;e, thanked her for her kind
<PB N="220" REF="229">
reception, and endeavouring to &s;lip a piece of money into
her hand, was &s;urprized at her declining to accept it.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e circum&s;tances inciting my curio&s;ity to obtain
&s;ome intelligence concerning this old woman, I collected
the following account. She is a native of Lower Engadina,
of a good family, and formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a tolerable fortune:
&s;he married, when very young, a nobleman of the fir&s;t fa|mily
of Milan, who came into Engadina, renounced the
Roman Catholic religion, and embraced the Prote&s;tant doc|trines.
They lived for many years in the greate&s;t harmony,
till having di&s;&s;ipated almo&s;t all her fortune, he one day took
leave of her, with a promi&s;e of returning in a &s;hort time.
From that moment &s;he never &s;aw him, nor heard from him,
and &s;he was afterwards informed that he was gone to Italy,
and, having reimbraced the Roman Catholic religion, had
turned monk: upon receiving this information, his wife
collected the &s;can$y remains of her fortune, and retired to
the &s;pot where I found her.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the extremity of Lower Engadina I cro&s;&s;ed the
Inn over St. Martin's bridge, at a little village of the &s;ame
name: on the other &s;ide I came into Tyrol, where that river
&s;truggles through a very narrow channel, between two
ridges of high and rugged rocks. I now took a farewel of
the Inn, which I had accompanied from its &s;ource. At St.
Martin's bridge it forms the &s;eparation of Engadina and the
Tyrol; on receiving the torrent Schargenbach, it quits the
territory of the Gri&s;ons, and pa&s;&s;ing through the Tyrol and
<PB N="221" REF="230">
the Electorate of Bavaria, joins the Danube at Pa&s;&s;au with &s;o
large a body of water, as to equal, if not &s;urpa&s;s, the cele|brated
river in which it lo&s;es its name. Hence Scheutzer
has laboured to prove, that the Danube may be &s;aid to ri&s;e
in the Rhetian Alps with more ju&s;tne&s;s than in the moun|tains
of Suabia, becau&s;e the proportion of waters, which de|&s;cend
from the former, is greater than what is &s;upplied from
the latter.</P>
<P>IN the village of St. Martin Roman&s;h is &s;poken; on the
other &s;ide of the bridge ju&s;t mentioned German is the
language of the country. From the &s;teep banks of the Inn I
a&s;cended a high mountain, along an excellent road, lately
formed at the expence of the emperor, in order to facilitate
the communication between Milan and the Tyrol. Having
enjoyed from the top a fine view of the Inn and Lower En|gadina,
I de&s;cended to Nauders, and dined upon a cold fowl,
which Mr. Planta had ordered my &s;ervant to put up for me,
without which precaution I &s;hould have made but a &s;canty
meal.</P>
<P>FROM Nauders I went along a &s;mall plea&s;ant valley,
bounded on the left by a ridge of mountains which &s;eparate
the Tyrol from Engadina. The valley is about a quarter
of a mile broad, and almo&s;t level: it is covered with rich
pa&s;ture, and watered by a lively torrent that falls into the
Inn. At the end of this valley I came to a gentle a&s;cent, on
the other &s;ide of which there is a lake, which is one of the
fir&s;t &s;ources of the Adige; beyond this is another lake, and
<PB N="222" REF="231">
further on a third: the banks of the&s;e lakes are prettily
&s;kirted with villages, at one of which I pa&s;&s;ed the night.</P>
<P>HAVING a long day's journey from thence to Bormio, I
&s;et out at five this morning, and proceeded by the &s;ide of the
torrent which flows from the lakes and forms the Adige.
The country is agreeable, and in high cultivation, e&s;pecially
where it opens into a rich and exten&s;ive view beyond Mals,
which town I pa&s;&s;ed at a little di&s;tance on my left hand, and
turned &s;hort into the road that leads to the valley of Mun&s;ter.
At the bottom of the fir&s;t a&s;cent I went through Laitch,
which is &s;ubject in &s;piritual affairs to the bi&s;hop of Coire, in
temporal to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. From thence I mounted
through a rich ri&s;ing valley to Santa Maria. Tauven is the
la&s;t village in the Tyrol where the inhabitants &s;peak Ger|man.
A little beyond that place I pa&s;&s;ed the barrier, and
again entered the territory of the Gri&s;ons, where the Ro|man&s;h
is the common tongue. At Mun&s;ter is a mona&s;tery
for women, from<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mona&s;terium.</NOTE> which the name of the town and of the
valley is derived. It is very antient, and &s;aid to have been
founded by Charlemagne: I was not, however, permitted to
examine it, as it is again&s;t the rules of all nunneries to admit
a male vi&s;itant within the walls. I proceeded to Santa Maria,
from whence I am now writing.</P>
<P>THIS valley of Mun&s;ter contains Santa Maria, Mun&s;ter,
Valdera, Cierfs, and &s;everal other villages, which form a
community in the league of God's Hou&s;e. Formerly the
<PB N="223" REF="232">
bi&s;hop of Coire had con&s;iderable influence and power in the
government of the valley. Ju&s;tice was admini&s;tered in his
name, and he received the amercements for criminal offences;
but having violent di&s;putes with the inhabitants, he &s;old
the&s;e rights in 1727 to the emperor Charles the Sixth: the
republic of the Gri&s;ons, however, objecting to this transfer
of immunities, which they con&s;idered as unalienable, the
bi&s;hop was obliged to re-purcha&s;e, and di&s;po&s;e of them to
the inhabitants, who are now perfectly independent. The
people are divided into Catholics and Prote&s;tants; the Catho|lics
inhabiting the town of Mun&s;ter, with its immediate de|pendencies,
the Prote&s;tants the remainder of the valley: the
magi&s;trates and judges are cho&s;en equally from both parties,
who live together in tolerable harmony. The common
language is the Roman&s;h, the &s;ame as &s;poken in Lower En|gadina,
though not quite &s;o pure, as, on account of its proxi|mity
and connection with the Tyrol, it is blended with a
great number of German words.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PASSAGE OF MOUNT BRALIO&mdash;COUNTY AND TOWN
OF BORMIO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bormio, <DATE>Augu&s;t 7th.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age from Santa Maria to this place was very
tedious, and would have been attended with &s;ome
danger had I been detained a day later; as the great quantity
of rain, which has poured down without intermi&s;&s;ion, would
have rendered the Alpine paths extremely &s;lippery. I conti|nued
to a&s;cend two hours from Santa Maria to the top of
Mount Bralio, which &s;eparates the valley of Mun&s;ter from
the county of Bormio. This body of Alps is &s;uppo&s;ed to be
the &s;ame which Tacitus mentions under the name of <HI>Juga
Rhaetica</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. lib. i.</NOTE>. A&s;cending the whole way by the &s;ide of the
torrent Ramo, the &s;ame which flows by Laitch, and falls into
the Adige<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Or rather two torrents form by their junction the Adige.</NOTE> below Mals, I traced it to its &s;ource, where it
ru&s;hes from a glacier, amid&s;t an enclo&s;ure of &s;urrounding
rocks. A few paces further, on the &s;ummit of the Bralio,
another torrent falls from the &s;ame glacier in a contrary di|rection,
which forms the fir&s;t &s;ource of the Adda.</P>
<P>FROM this point a de&s;cent commences, and continues,
with little interruption, to Bormio. The tops of the&s;e
<PB N="225" REF="234">
mountains produce no wood, but yield excellent pa&s;ture;
they were covered with cattle. The mo&s;t elevated parts are
of granite, but not near &s;o fine grained as that which is ob|&s;erved
upon the St. Gothard, and &s;ome of the other Swi&s;s
Alps. I then went down a very narrow rugged path, and
in an hour entered the county of Bormio, and a &s;mall plain
about a mile in length, in the mid&s;t of which is a &s;ingle
hou&s;e, that is termed an inn; and which is the fir&s;t habita|tion
I met with &s;ince I quitted the valley of Mun&s;ter. There
was no one within but a woman and two children, who
&s;poke a corrupt Italian: the woman was greatly affronted on
my inquiring if &s;he talked Roman&s;h; being a Roman Catho|lic,
&s;he &s;eemed to con&s;ider it as a kind of here&s;y to under&s;tand
that language.</P>
<P>I FOLLOWED the cour&s;e of the Adda, which flows
through the plain; it is at fir&s;t a &s;mall torrent, but gra|dually
increa&s;es, by a continued acce&s;&s;ion of water from
the neighbouring mountains. At the end of this &s;mall plain
the de&s;cent recommences, and the track from thence to Bor|mio
is as craggy as the highe&s;t parts of Switzerland. Since
my entrance into the country of the Gri&s;ons, I have not yet
met with &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenes of wildne&s;s, horror, and
maje&s;ty, as occurred in this day's journey. De&s;cription ge|nerally
fails in repre&s;enting the mo&s;t ordinary exhibitions of
nature; how inadequate then mu&s;t it be to the &s;ingular
combination of &s;ublime objects, which I &s;hall now attempt
to delineate?</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="235">
ON quitting the &s;mall plain I entered &s;uddenly into a mo&s;t
barren and de&s;olate region; on my right hand huge piles of
mis&s;hapen Alps; on my left a large ma&s;s of ice and &s;now.
Clo&s;e to the path the Adda foams from precipice to precipice
in broken cataracts; lower down it &s;hoots over a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of natural &s;teps, which &s;eem as if they had been hewn in the
rock by art; at the di&s;tance of about a mile, it is contracted
in a narrow channel, through which it labours with ince&s;|&s;ant
fury. Over this tremendous gulph is a &s;light wooden
bridge, which is partly &s;upported upon a detached fragment
of rock, and partly &s;u&s;pended upon the &s;ides of the oppo|&s;ite
mountains: as we pa&s;&s;ed over, it tottered with our
weight. I then continued upon the edge of a deep aby&s;s, the
Adda roaring beneath, though no where vi&s;ible, &s;ugge&s;ting
to my imagination cataracts more &s;tupendous than any I had
hitherto &s;een. Its channel is cut perpendicularly in the
rock, which has evidently been hollowed to the depth of
&s;ome hundred feet by the attrition of the waters.</P>
<P>I NOW arrived at a barren &s;pot, where the vale was entirely
clo&s;ed by an impa&s;&s;able mountain: a &s;tream bur&s;ts from a &s;mall
opening in the rock, and then expanding as it falls, forms a
con&s;iderable torrent, foaming amid&s;t va&s;t fragments of &s;tone.
Having turned &s;uddenly to the left, by an opening through
which the Adda &s;eems to have forced a pa&s;&s;age, I di&s;covered
&s;ome fertile fields lying upon the &s;ide of a di&s;tant mountain,
which beautifully contra&s;ted with the wild and uncultivated
&s;cenes we had ju&s;t quitted: a few paces further was the
pro&s;pect of a fertile plain extending to Bormio, the Adda
<PB N="227" REF="236">
flowing in a milder &s;tream, which a moment before roared
underneath our feet, over broken precipices. In about
half an hour I reached the baths of St. Martin, in the valley
of Premaglia; they are formed by &s;everal hot &s;prings which
ri&s;e near Molina, and are much frequented at this &s;ea&s;on of
the year. They are of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e of Bath,
but did not appear &s;o hot. From thence I de&s;cended into
the plain, which produces &s;ome corn, and yields excellent
pa&s;ture, and in &s;hort time arrived at Bormio. Every thing
now wears an Italian look: the villages are very inferior to
tho&s;e in the Gri&s;ons. The hou&s;es are pla&s;tered, and have a
dirty appearance; and it was no bad remark of my &s;ervant,
that the villages looked as if the inhabitants were mo&s;tly
dead, and the place de&s;erted. This road over the Bralio, al|though
&s;o indifferent, was formerly the principal pa&s;&s;age for
the merchandi&s;e &s;ent from the Tyrol, through the Valteline,
into the Milane&s;e: at pre&s;ent it is much le&s;s frequented.</P>
<P>THE county of Bormio, &s;ubject to the Gri&s;ons, lies at the
foot and in the mid&s;t of the Rhetian Alps, and borders upon
Engadina, the valley of Mun&s;ter, the Valteline, Tyrol,
Trent, and the Venetian territories. It is entirely enclo&s;ed
within the mountains, except a narrow opening, which con|nects
it with the Valteline: the other acce&s;&s;es to it lie acro&s;s
the rugged Alps, and are &s;imilar to the pa&s;&s;age over the Bra|lio:
in winter they are frequently impa&s;&s;able. This county,
once a part of the Milane&s;e, became &s;ubject to the Gri&s;ons in
1512: the concurrence of extraordinary circum&s;tances, which
occa&s;ioned this revolution, will be related in the &s;ub&s;equent
<PB N="228" REF="237">
letter, upon the Valteline; for, as the Valteline came under
the dominion of the Gri&s;ons at the &s;ame period, and from
the &s;ame cau&s;es, the two hi&s;tories are &s;o intimately blended,
that they cannot be &s;eparated.</P>
<P>THE county is divided into five di&s;tricts, 1. Bormio,
which compri&s;es the capital, and &s;everal dependent villages.
2. The valley of Furba. 3. The valley of Pedino&s;a. 4. The
valley of Cepino. 5. The valley of Luvino. The inhabi|tants
of the Luvino po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;everal privileges, particularly the
power of judging civil cau&s;es within a certain value. They
do not, however, appoint any of the magi&s;trates, who are all
cho&s;en from the four other di&s;tricts. The county of Bormio
enjoys very ample immunities, &s;ome of which are not ex|tended
to the Valteline, or Chiavenna; in virtue of which,
the inhabitants are exempted from the oppre&s;&s;ions &s;o wan|tonly
exerci&s;ed by the Gri&s;on governors in the other &s;ub|ject
countries.</P>
<P>1. THE inhabitants pay a fixed contribution to the Gri|&s;ons,
which is very moderate, and cannot be increa&s;ed.
2. They collect and enjoy their own duties upon exports
and imports, which &s;ecures them from injudicious and op|pre&s;&s;ive
taxes. 3. The fines for criminal offences belong
to the community; a circum&s;tance very friendly to the ad|mini&s;tration
of ju&s;tice: for no part of them being a&s;&s;igned
to the governor, as is the ca&s;e in the other &s;ubject provinces,
he is not intere&s;ted to convict criminals. 4. But the princi|pal
privilege which di&s;tingui&s;hes this country from the Val|teline,
<PB N="229" REF="238">
is the freedom of its government, and the limitation
of the pode&s;ta's authority.</P>
<P>BORMIO, like all the other &s;ubject countries, is governed
by a &s;upreme magi&s;trate called <HI>Pode&s;t&agrave;,</HI> who is &s;ent from the
Gri&s;ons, and continues two years in office: his authority is &s;o
exceedingly circum&s;cribed, that he enjoys &s;carcely any
power, but with the concurrence of the councils. He pre|&s;ides
in the&s;e councils without giving a vote, except in ca&s;e
of equality; he has neither the power of arre&s;ting a crimi|nal,
nor of pardoning or le&s;&s;ening the puni&s;hment; he re|ceives
a yearly &s;tipend from the country of about &pound;. 80, ari&s;ing
partly from a payment in money, partly from an allowance
of rye, and partly from the co&s;ts of &s;uit in civil and criminal
cau&s;es. But the re&s;trictions laid on his authority will be&s;t
appear from the following &s;hort &s;ketch of the e&s;tabli&s;hed
government.</P>
<P>THE &s;upreme authority re&s;ides in the pode&s;ta and coun|cils,
which con&s;i&s;t in a civil and criminal tribunal, who&s;e
members are annually cho&s;en by the people. The criminal
court, or the council of Sixteen, who are changed every four
months, is compo&s;ed of two regents, the trea&s;urer, the no|tary,
and &s;ixteen coun&s;ellors, ten of whom are taken from
the town, and two from each of the vallies of Furba, Pedi|no&s;a,
and Cepino: of the&s;e members only the &s;ixteen
coun&s;ellors have any vote. At the reque&s;t of the two re|gents,
this council is convened by the pode&s;ta. In order to
arre&s;t a criminal, the whole council ought to a&s;&s;emble, or at
<PB N="230" REF="239">
lea&s;t &s;even of the members; but in any ca&s;e of importance,
the pode&s;ta and two regents may give an order of arre&s;t;
this, however, being contrary to law, mu&s;t be referred to the
fir&s;t meeting of the council, which, if &s;atisfied, decrees in
the words of their code, <HI>Male captus; bene detentus;</HI> the ar|re&s;t
was illegal, but expedient. The proce&s;s is formed, and
the pri&s;oner examined by the pode&s;ta and two regents, who
lay the proceedings before the council. If the criminal is
convicted, and will not confe&s;s his crime, the majority of the
council decide whether the proofs are &s;trong enough to
ju&s;tify torture: when that horrid expedient is deemed
requi&s;ite, it mu&s;t be applied in the pre&s;ence of the pode&s;ta,
the two regents, the trea&s;urer, and notary.</P>
<P>THE fines are paid to the community, which (&s;hould the
pri&s;oner be in&s;olvent) defrays the expence of the proce&s;s.
If the proofs again&s;t the pri&s;oner appear in&s;ufficient for his
conviction, the pode&s;ta and coun&s;ellors receive nothing for
their attendance: this regulation, which was de&s;igned to
prevent frivolous pro&s;ecutions, is productive of this ill effect,
that it induces the judges to &s;train the &s;lighte&s;t circum&s;tances
into proofs of guilt, and not unfrequently occa&s;ions the in|fliction
of torture<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Little more is wanting to the reformation of criminal juri&s;prudence in Bormio, than to render the examinations public; to pay the judges for their attendance, whether the pri&s;oner is innocent or guilty; and to aboli&s;h torture.</NOTE>. The civil tribunal con&s;i&s;ts of twelve
members, taken from the town of Bormio, who determine
all civil cau&s;es in the fir&s;t in&s;tance: from their deci&s;ion there
lies an appeal to the &s;yndicate of the Gri&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="240">
THE members of the&s;e councils are cho&s;en annually in
the following manner, by the a&s;&s;embly of the people, con|&s;i&s;ting
of, 1. All tho&s;e who have been magi&s;trates; 2. Of
&s;ixty per&s;ons from the town, nominated by the two chiefs
of the people; 3. Of &s;ixty per&s;ons cho&s;en equally by the
three vallies; 4. Of three deputies from the valley of Lu|vino.
All the&s;e repre&s;entatives a&s;&s;emble on the 15th of
June, in the town-hall of Bormio: the election is carried on
in the mo&s;t democratical manner, upon a plan calculated to
prevent all influence; which, however, can never be entirely
excluded by the mo&s;t complicated mode of election ever in|vented.
Without enlarging upon the form of voting by
ballot u&s;ed at Bormio, I &s;hall, on account of its &s;ingularity,
only briefly de&s;cribe the ceremony of choo&s;ing the two
regents. After the nomination of the coun&s;ellors, the
regent la&s;t in office points to &s;ome per&s;on in the a&s;&s;embly.
At the &s;ame in&s;tant the trea&s;urer mentions &s;ome number,
as for in&s;tance, ten, fifteen, &amp;c. This number is imme|diately
counted by the regent, beginning from the per&s;on to
whom he is pointing: the la&s;t &s;ix of the per&s;ons counted
retire into a &s;eparate room, and chu&s;e &s;ix members of the a&s;|&s;embly,
namely, three from the di&s;trict of Bormio, and three
from the valleys, who appoint &s;ix candidates. The names
of the latter are thrown into &s;ix bags, and ballotted for, and
the two, who have the greate&s;t number of ballots, are re|gents.
They remain in office only four months, in order to
prevent their abu&s;ing their power, which is very great.</P>
<P>THE expences of government are regulated with demo|cratic
jealou&s;y; and the accounts are annually &s;ubmitted to
the in&s;pection of each di&s;trict, in the following manner:
<PB N="232" REF="241">
When the regents retire from office, the trea&s;urer delivers
in a &s;ummary of the expences and receipts incurred during
their admini&s;tration, which is read to the council of Sixteen,
and cannot pa&s;s without their approbation. In October the
council elects three examiners, two of whom are always
taken from the inhabitants of the town, and one reciprocally
from each of the three valleys. The&s;e examiners make a
report, which is laid before a deputation from the town and
the valleys on the 3d of May, and five copies are di&s;tributed
to the &s;everal deputies, for the in&s;pection of their re&s;pective
con&s;tituents: la&s;tly, the report is read before the a&s;&s;embly of

<P>IN this calculation a few occa&s;ional expences are omitted,
which render the general outgoings greater than the re|ceipts:
the overplus is &s;upplied by equal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments. For
the purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, there is a perpetual committee, con|&s;i&s;ting
of twelve members cho&s;en from the town, and two
from each valley, which is convoked by the regents. The
&s;um required being laid before them, they fix the quota ac|cording
to a calculation of property.</P>
<P>THE mountainous parts of this country produce only
pa&s;turage and wood: the lower di&s;trict about Bormio yields
corn, but not &s;ufficient for dome&s;tic con&s;umption. The in|habitants
export cattle, a &s;mall quantity of chee&s;e, and iron:
the iron is obtained from the mine of Freli, in the valley of
Pedino&s;o, worked at the expence, and for the profit, of a
private per&s;on, who pays to the community a &s;mall annual
rent. Wine is imported from the Valteline, corn from the
Tyrol, corn and rice from Milan, linen from Bergamo and
Appenzel, and cloth from Germany.</P>

THE Roman Catholic is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this
country, and the exerci&s;e of every other wor&s;hip is prohi|bited:
even the pode&s;ta him&s;elf, if a Prote&s;tant, is not en|titled
to any indulgence in this particular<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">For the cau&s;es of this prohibition, which takes place in all the provinces &s;ubject to the Gri&s;ons, &s;ee the next letter.</NOTE>. Spiritual af|fairs
are under the juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hop of Coire, who
has a vicar's court at Bormio, in which all eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es
are tried. The prie&s;ts have peculiar privileges, which are
even extended to tho&s;e who wear a clerical dre&s;s. Although
many abu&s;es re&s;ult from tho&s;e exorbitant immunities, yet,
from the nature of the government, they are more re&s;trained
here than in the Valteline. Mo&s;t of the pea&s;ants po&s;&s;e&s;s a
&s;mall portion of land, and, in con&s;equence of the freedom of
the government, are much happier than the people of the
Valteline and Chiavenna.</P>
<P>THE town of Bormio is not unplea&s;antly &s;ituated, at the
foot of the mountains, clo&s;e to the torrent Fredolfo, which
falls at a &s;mall di&s;tance into the Adda. It contains about a
thou&s;and inhabitants, but has a de&s;olate appearance. The
hou&s;es are of &s;tone pla&s;tered: a few make a tolerable figure
amid&s;t many with paper windows; &s;everal, like the Italian
cottages, have only wooden window-&s;hutters. This fa&s;hion
may not be uncomfortable in the mild climate of Italy, but
cannot be very agreeable in this country, &s;ubject to &s;ud|den
changes of weather, and occa&s;ionally cold even in the
mid&s;t of &s;ummer, when the bleak winds blow keenly from
the Alps.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="244">
THE landlord of the inn in which I am lodged is one of
the regents, and appears a man of great con&s;equence. I &s;it
down to table with him, the pode&s;ta, and his wife. The
pode&s;ta has been lately appointed to this government, and
it appears, from the conver&s;ation which has pa&s;&s;ed, that he
is perfectly ignorant of the laws and con&s;titution of this
country; in all my que&s;tions he refers me to my landlord,
who is thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice
of the courts of ju&s;tice, and well ver&s;ed in the mo&s;t minute
circum&s;tances, relative to the admini&s;tration of affairs.</P>
<P>IT has rained all day without intermi&s;&s;ion, and the
&s;howers in the&s;e Alpine countries pour down with &s;uch un|common
violence, that I e&s;teem my&s;elf very fortunate in
being well &s;heltered. The bad weather, however, did not
prevent me from &s;eeing every thing which is worthy of at|tention
in Bormio, and in paying &s;everal vi&s;its to the prin|cipal
families of the town, who con&s;ider an Engli&s;hman in
this country, as a kind of phaenomenon, and &s;hewed me
every attention and civility in their power. The Palazzo,
or town-hou&s;e, contains a &s;uite of wretched apartments for
the re&s;idence of the pode&s;ta, a chamber for the courts of
judicature, and an apartment where the repre&s;entatives of
the people a&s;&s;emble. In one of the rooms is an engine of
torture, which, in defiance of common &s;en&s;e, as well as hu|manity,
is &s;till u&s;ed in the&s;e countries to force confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BEING de&s;irous of &s;eeing the archives, I found it occa|&s;ioned
more trouble than I at fir&s;t apprehended. The door
of the apartment, in which they are depo&s;ited, has &s;everal
<PB N="236" REF="245">
locks; and it was nece&s;&s;ary for all the magi&s;trates, who are
entru&s;ted with the different keys, to be pre&s;ent at the &s;ame
time: no objection, however, was made to my admi&s;&s;ion,
and all parties readily a&s;&s;embled upon this occa&s;ion. The ar|chives,
which are in the greate&s;t di&s;order, contain many re|cords
relating to the hi&s;tory and con&s;titution of Bormio, the
criminal and civil &s;tatutes, and &s;everal charters from the &s;o|vereigns
of Milan, confirming original privileges and adding
others. The earlie&s;t of the&s;e acts is dated 1378, and &s;igned
by John Galeazzo Vi&s;conti.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t important of the papers is the charter, by
which the Gri&s;ons confirm, in the mo&s;t ample manner, the
immunities granted to this country by the dukes of Milan:
it was pa&s;&s;ed in the diet of Ilantz, under Paul, bi&s;hop of
Coire, in 1513, the year &s;ub&s;equent to that in which the
Gri&s;ons annexed Bormio to their dominions. Many circum|&s;tances
have concurred to deter the Gri&s;ons from infringing
this charter: the two principal cau&s;es are, the &s;ituation of
Bormio, and the &s;pirit of freedom which di&s;tingui&s;hes the
inhabitants. By its &s;ituation upon the confines of the
Tyrol, the people, in ca&s;e of the lea&s;t di&s;content, would re|ceive
encouragement and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria. This local advantage procured them, while under
the government of Milan, much better treatment than
was experienced by their neighbours in the Valteline;
and a &s;imilar rea&s;on &s;till continues to operate upon the
conduct of the Gri&s;ons. The &s;pirit of freedom al&s;o, which
pervades the con&s;titution, has no le&s;s materially contributed
to the &s;ecurity of their privileges: the&s;e people have al|ways
<PB N="237" REF="246">
watched with a jealous eye the &s;lighte&s;t advances of en|croachment;
and have never failed to remon&s;trate with great
unanimity and re&s;olution, whenever the pode&s;ta has di&s;co|vered
the lea&s;t inclination to exceed the bounds of his autho|rity.
Hence the Gri&s;ons have uniformly acted towards
them with great moderation, and have ever paid the readie&s;t
attention to their repre&s;entations and remon&s;trances.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 75.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TIRANO&mdash;SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE
VALTELINE.</HEAD>
<P>Tirano.</P>
<P>I QUITTED Bormio this morning about ten. The torrents
are con&s;iderably &s;welled with the late rains; and the
&s;ides of the neighbouring mountains are &s;prinkled with ye&s;|terday's
&s;now. From Bormio I pa&s;&s;ed along the narrow val|ley
of Cepino, through &s;everal wretched villages, among
which not the lea&s;t wretched is Cepino it&s;elf, con&s;i&s;ting of a
few &s;traggling cottages, many of which are in a ruinous
&s;tate. Having cro&s;&s;ed the Adda, and continued on the left
&s;hore of that torrent, which da&s;hes with great violence
through a rocky country, in three hours I came to a pa&s;s
called La Serra, where almo&s;t the whole &s;pace between the
impending rocks, excepting a &s;mall path, is occupied by
the Adda.</P>
<P>THE path runs under the gateway of an ancient tower,
and leads from the county of Bormio into the Valteline.
At Sondalo, which &s;tands on the banks of the river upon an
eminence, under a richly cultivated mountain, the valley
widens, and becomes more and more fertile: in &s;ome places
it is about a mile, in others &s;carcely a hundred yards in
breadth. Near Tirano the valley exhibits an appearance of
extraordinary fertility. The left ridge of mountains is
<PB N="239" REF="248">
chiefly over&s;pread with hanging groves of che&s;nut-trees,
intermixed with a few vines; above them are meadows
and fore&s;t of fir. The ridge fronting the &s;outhern &s;un
is richly covered with vines, which reach almo&s;t to the
&s;ummit, &s;tudded occa&s;ionally with clu&s;ters of large trees:
on both &s;ides churches and hou&s;es half concealed by the
foliage enliven the pro&s;pect. Below runs the Adda. The
plain on each &s;ide of its banks produces abundance of corn
and pa&s;ture, mulberries, walnuts, and other fruit-trees, and
vines carried over the corn and pa&s;ture in beautiful fe&s;toons
from tree to tree.</P>
<P>TIRANO is the capital of the Upper Terzero, and the re|&s;idence
of the pode&s;ta. Although the town contains &s;eve|ral
hand&s;ome buildings, yet, on account of the narrowne&s;s of
the &s;treets, and number of ruinous hou&s;es, its general ap|pearance
is de&s;olate. The Adda divides it into two parts,
which are joined by a &s;tone bridge of a &s;ingle arch. I ob|&s;erved
remains of &s;tone walls, with which this place was
formerly &s;urrounded. The&s;e walls, together with an ad|joining
fortre&s;s, were built by Ludovico Sforza, again&s;t the
incur&s;ions of the Gri&s;ons; but were di&s;mantled by the Gri|&s;ons,
when they acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Valteline.
Tirano carries on but little trade, except during the time of
the fair. The &s;taple commerce of the town con&s;i&s;ts in the ex|portation
of wine and &s;ilk; the former article, which is the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable, is &s;ent in large quantities into the country
of the Gri&s;ons, to Bormio, and into the territories of Venice.
The &s;ilk, which is drawn from this di&s;trict of the Valteline,
is not of the be&s;t quality, nor very abundant: part is &s;ent
<PB N="240" REF="249">
to Venice, and the remainder, through Chiavenna, to
Germany.</P>
<P>ABOUT half a mile from the town, on the other &s;ide of
the Adda, is the church of the Madonna, or the Virgin Mary,
much vi&s;ited by the Catholic pilgrims. It is a large hand|&s;ome
building, con&s;tructed with marble, and &s;tone &s;tuccoed.
Part of the church is ancient, bearing a date of 1206: the
carved ornaments in this part are grote&s;que, but by no means
badly fini&s;hed. The modern building is in an elegant &s;tyle of
architecture. The principal entrance is formed by two Co|rinthian
pillars ornamented with foliage and fe&s;toons of
flowers, while the pila&s;ters are neatly adorned with <HI>ba&s;&s;o re|lievos,</HI>
in the &s;tyle of the antique. The aera of the work|man&s;hip,
as might be collected from an in&s;cription over the
door, was 1533. In the large area before the church is held,
in the month of October, the fair of Tirano, remarkable for
the number of cattle which are brought for &s;ale: they are
fed upon the highe&s;t Alps, where they continue until the
&s;now begins to fall, and are chiefly &s;ent from hence into
Italy. The fair continues three days, during which time
the authority of the pode&s;ta is &s;u&s;pended; and the governor
of the Valteline has ab&s;olute juri&s;diction over the town and
di&s;trict.</P>
<P>I CANNOT de&s;cribe to you how much I am perplexed
with a variety of languages. I &s;peak Italian or French with
the principal gentry, and &s;ometimes am obliged to hold a
conver&s;ation in Latin; talk a &s;mattering of German with my
&s;ervant, who under&s;tands no other language, and, with my
guide and the common people, a kind of corrupt Italian,
<PB N="241" REF="250">
like the Milane&s;e; write my notes in Engli&s;h, and during
my progre&s;s through Engadina, was employed in collecting
a vocabulary of the Roman&s;h. You mu&s;t not therefore be
&s;urpri&s;ed, &s;hould you find in my letters a confu&s;ion of
tongues.</P>
<P>THE Valteline, called by the inhabitants <HI>Valle-Telina,</HI> ex|tends
from the confines of Bormio to the lake of Chiavenna,
about the length of fifty miles. It is entirely enclo&s;ed
between two chains of high mountains; the northern chain
&s;eparates it from the Gri&s;ons, the &s;outhern from the Venetian
territories: on the ea&s;t it borders on the county of Bormio,
and on the we&s;t on the dutchy of Milan.</P>
<P>THE Valteline, together with the counties of Chiavenna
and Bormio (which had long been the con&s;tant &s;ource of
ho&s;tility between the bi&s;hops of Como and Coire) came in
1336 under the dominion of Azzo Vi&s;conti, &s;overeign of
Milan, who quietly tran&s;mitted them to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.
Upon the death of John Vi&s;conti, one of Azzo's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,
his exten&s;ive territories were divided between his nephews
Galeazzo and Barnabas<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I do not mention Matthias, the elde&s;t brother, becau&s;e he died &s;oon afterwards.</NOTE>. Upon the demi&s;e of Galeazzo,
his &s;on John Galeazzo &s;ecured the per&s;on of his uncle Bar|nabas,
and having confined him in the ca&s;tle of Trevio
until his death, which happened in 1395, annexed his do|minions
to his own, and became by this union the greate&s;t
and mo&s;t powerful prince in Italy. Ma&s;tino, &s;on of Bar|nabas,
took &s;helter, upon his father's impri&s;onment, with
Hartman, bi&s;hop of Coire, and died in exile, without re|covering
<PB N="242" REF="251">
covering any &s;hare of his inheritance. Previous to his death
he formally ceded all his right and title over the Valteline,
Chiavenna, and Bormio, to the bi&s;hop of Coire, as a mark
of gratitude for his protection. To this ce&s;&s;ion, at that time
of no avail, the Gri&s;ons owe the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e provinces.
The claim lay dormant for above half a century, until &s;ome
di&s;contents ari&s;ing in the Valteline in 1487, the Gri&s;ons made
an irruption into that country, in &s;upport of the bi&s;hop's
right; but their arms not being at that time attended with
&s;ucce&s;s, they purcha&s;ed a peace, by renouncing all preten|&s;ions
to the Valteline. They renewed, however, their claim
in 1512, when Ludovico, called the Moor, Duke of Milan,
was taken pri&s;oner by Lewis the Twelfth, and the whole Mi|lane&s;e,
compri&s;ing the Valteline, occupied by that monarch.</P>
<P>UPON this revolution, the Gri&s;ons, in conjunction with
the bi&s;hop of Coire, entered the Valteline, and, having ex|pelled
the French troops, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country:
they were received with joy by the inhabitants, who did
homage to their new &s;overeigns, and in return obtained
from them the confirmation of all their privileges. A com|promi&s;e
was immediately entered into between the bi&s;hop
of Coire and the three leagues, to &s;hare between them the
&s;overeignty of this country. In the following year Maxi|milian
Sforza, rai&s;ed to the ducal throne of Milan upon the
expul&s;ion of the French, ceded in perpetuity the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the Valteline, Chiavenna, and Bormio, to the bi&s;hop of
Coire, and the Gri&s;ons; and this ce&s;&s;ion was ratified by
Francis the Fir&s;t, in the treaty of peace which he concluded
with the Swi&s;s and their allies the Gri&s;ons in 1516, when he
obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Milane&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="252">
IN 1530 the Republic of the Gri&s;ons acquired the whole
dominion of the Valteline, to the exclu&s;ion of the bi&s;hop of
Coire; under pretence, that the bi&s;hop had not furni&s;hed his
quota of men and money in the war with James of Medici,
in defence of the&s;e ceded countries: accordingly they com|pelled
the bi&s;hop to &s;ell his &s;hare of the &s;overeignty over the
Valteline, Chiavenna, and Bormio, for a yearly income of
573 florins, to be paid to the bi&s;hop and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors out of
the cu&s;toms of Chiavenna. From that period the&s;e provinces
were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Gri&s;ons without mole&s;tation, until the
rival intere&s;ts of France and Spain, the intrigues of the pope,
religious enthu&s;ia&s;m, the zeal of party, and the exactions
of the Gri&s;on governors, kindled an in&s;urrection, which com|menced
with a general ma&s;&s;acre of the Prote&s;tants, and
raged for a &s;eries of years with the mo&s;t &s;avage and un|remitting
fury.</P>
<P>IN no country has the &s;pirit of di&s;cord been more pre|valent,
or religious di&s;putes been carried to a greater height.
The zeal of contending factions has communicated it&s;elf to
the hi&s;torians of the&s;e tran&s;actions; each of whom is evi|dently
enli&s;ted in a party, and gives different repre&s;entations
of the &s;ame facts, according to the intere&s;ts he has e&s;pou&s;ed.
Under the&s;e di&s;advantages, there is no other method of ar|riving
at the truth, than by comparing contradictory ac|counts,
and rendering them mutually &s;ub&s;ervient to the de|tection
of each other's impo&s;ition; and I am concerned to
find, that on both &s;ides religion has been pleaded as a &s;anction
to the mo&s;t atrocious actions, and been alledged by one party
as an excu&s;e for tyranny, and for rebellion by the other.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="253">
As the Valteline, Chiavenna, and Bormio, originally
belonged to the Milane&s;e, the &s;overeigns of that dutchy
always looked upon the Gri&s;ons with a jealous eye, and
&s;ecretly embraced every opportunity to foment the inte&s;tine
di&s;turbances with which they, in common with all demo|cratical
&s;tates, are occa&s;ionally convul&s;ed. Upon the ex|tinction
of the family of Sforza in the per&s;on of Francis the
Second, the emperor Charles the Fifth &s;eized the Milane&s;e
as a fief reverting to the empire, and di&s;regarding the claims
of the French king, gave the inve&s;titure to his own &s;on
Philip. With the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Milane&s;e Philip &s;ucceeded
to his preten&s;ions upon the Valteline; and although both
he and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Philip the Third, entered into treaties of
alliance with the three leagues, by which they re&s;igned all
claims to this country, yet their renunciation was never
&s;incere. They never finally relinqui&s;hed all intention of
recovering a province which had been once di&s;membered
from the Milane&s;e, and which the conte&s;ts between France
and Spain rendered more valuable to them, than to their pre|dece&s;&s;ors
in the dutchy of Milan.</P>
<P>DURING the con&s;tant wars, which from the acce&s;&s;ion of
Philip the Second the re&s;tle&s;s ambition of the Spani&s;h
court entailed upon Europe, the German and Spani&s;h
branches of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria were in&s;eparably united;
and the councils of Vienna were directed by the cabinet of
Madrid. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances the Valteline, which,
by connecting the Tyrol and the Milane&s;e, afforded the
only &s;ecure pa&s;&s;age for the junction of the Au&s;trian and
Spani&s;h troops, became of &s;ignal importance. Hence the
<PB N="245" REF="254">
Spani&s;h governors of Milan, highly &s;olicitous to acquire in|fluence
among the people, &s;ecretly fomented the &s;pirit of
di&s;affection, which the conduct of the Gri&s;on governors had
too ju&s;tly provoked; promi&s;ed their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the ag|grieved
inhabitants, and gained by the&s;e means a powerful
party in favour of their court. The minds of the inha|bitants
being thus gradually won over to the Spani&s;h inte|re&s;t,
the Count of Fuentes, governor of Milan, ventured, in
defiance of the Gri&s;ons, to con&s;truct the fort<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 68.</NOTE> which bears his
name, for the purpo&s;e of commanding the pa&s;&s;age of the
Valteline. The &s;ame rea&s;ons which rendered the Spaniards
de&s;irous to &s;ecure the Valteline, induced the French to
ob&s;truct their de&s;igns. Henry the Fourth, with his u&s;ual
vigour, zealou&s;ly e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the Gri&s;ons, and was
preparing to &s;end effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the attempts of
Fuentes, when he was cut off by &s;udden a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; and
the inte&s;tine troubles, which took place upon his death, for
a time totally withdrew the attention of France from this
quarter. The Spaniards, thus freed from their mo&s;t for|midable
rival, pur&s;ued their projects upon the Valteline with|out
oppo&s;ition, and availed them&s;elves of the dome&s;tic di&s;|&s;en&s;ions
between the Gri&s;ons and the inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE Gri&s;ons had long attempted to introduce the Re|formation
into the Valteline with the mo&s;t injudicious zeal,
and without paying &s;ufficient attention to the prejudices of
a &s;uper&s;titious people. Churches for the wor&s;hip of the
Reformed religion were con&s;tructed, and mini&s;ters regularly
&s;ettled with a permanent &s;alary. Schools for Prote&s;tant
<PB N="246" REF="255">
children were e&s;tabli&s;hed at Sondrio, notwith&s;tanding the
remon&s;trances of the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, and the oppo&s;ition of
the people. Many privileges of the Popi&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tics were
taken from them; privileges<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">They were (as they are at pre&s;ent) independent of the civil authority for all delin|quencies, and amenable only to the bi&s;hop of Coire.</NOTE>, which though exorbitant,
and repugnant to every principle of &s;ound government,
were &s;anctified by u&s;age, and could not at once be aboli&s;hed
without exciting general di&s;content.</P>
<P>To the&s;e religious grounds of di&s;&s;atisfaction were added
others, ari&s;ing from the tyrannical proceedings of the Gri&s;on
governors, whom the advocates for rebellion painted, and it
is to be feared with too much ju&s;tice, in the mo&s;t odious
colours. &startq;A &s;y&s;tem,&endq; they cried, &startq;of avarice and extortion
is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; the magi&s;trates purcha&s;e their offices,
and indemnify them&s;elves by the plunder of the country.
All things are venal; life, honour, and even con&s;cience it&s;elf,
has a price. It is not po&s;&s;ible for the governors to be more
iniquitous, nor for the people to &s;uffer a greater complica|tion
of calamity.&endq; The&s;e well-grounded complaints were
aggravated, and the cri&s;is of rebellion accelerated, by an act
of flagrant inju&s;tice. Many inhabitants of the Valteline
&s;u&s;pected of favouring the Spani&s;h court, and particularly
tho&s;e, who had oppo&s;ed with the greate&s;t zeal the introduc|tion
of the Reformed doctrines, were arre&s;ted, and conveyed
into the country of the Gri&s;ons. Mock courts of ju&s;tice
were e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;everal places, by which the pri&s;oners
were fined to a large amount; and &s;ome were even wantonly
&s;entenced to the torture.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="256">
AMONG the &s;ufferers was Nicholas Ru&s;ca, a prie&s;t of
Sondrio, who had gained the univer&s;al e&s;teem of the Catho|lics,
by his unremitted re&s;i&s;tance to the Prote&s;tant doctrines,
and who, for the rigid au&s;terity of his manners, was revered
by the multitude as a &s;aint. The death<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 80.</NOTE> of this per&s;on &s;o
much re&s;pected, amid&s;t the mo&s;t excruciating torments,
rai&s;ed a &s;pirit of fury among the people too violent to be
appea&s;ed. The emi&s;&s;aries of Spain did not fail to increa&s;e the
general ferment, and to &s;ugge&s;t the mo&s;t plau&s;ible motives
for immediate in&s;urrection. They repre&s;ented, that, as the
Gri&s;ons were convul&s;ed by factions, and France di&s;turbed by
inte&s;tine commotions, a mo&s;t favourable opportunity pre|&s;ented
it&s;elf to &s;hake off the yoke under which they groaned:
animated by the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, the inhabitants determined
to commence ho&s;tilities by a general ma&s;&s;acre of the Pro|te&s;tants.</P>
<P>THE 20th of July, 1620, was the day appointed for the
perpetration of this horrid de&s;ign. At dead of night Ro|bu&s;telli,
the leader of the con&s;piracy, accompanied by about
a hundred followers, arrived at Tirano, and having a&s;&s;em|bled
the chief Catholics of the place, laid before them the
intention of extirpating the Prote&s;tants: the dreadful pro|po&s;al
was embraced with all the zeal of re&s;entment, inflamed
by fanatici&s;m. At break of day the &s;ignal for the ma&s;&s;acre
being given by ringing the bells; great part of the inhabi|tants
i&s;&s;ued from their hou&s;es, and repaired to the market|place
with terror and anxiety. In this moment of per|plexity
<PB N="248" REF="257">
the con&s;pirators fell upon the Prote&s;tants, and en|couraged
the people to follow their example, by de&s;troying
the enemies of the Catholic faith. Few words being ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to exa&s;perate an incen&s;ed and &s;uper&s;titious multitude;
every per&s;on &s;eizing the fir&s;t arms which pre&s;ented them|&s;elves,
&s;coured the &s;treets, &s;tormed the hou&s;es, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated
the Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>DURING this dreadful &s;cene, the pode&s;ta, his family, and
&s;ome of the principal Prote&s;tants took refuge in the town|hou&s;e,
and barricadoed the doors: the Catholics, however,
&s;oon forced a pa&s;&s;age, and bur&s;t into the apartments where
the fugitives were collected. Their fury was for a moment
&s;u&s;pended, at the affecting &s;ight of the pode&s;ta and his wife
upon their knees, pre&s;enting their infant children with up|lifted
arms. But &s;uch was the implacable barbarity of the en|raged
multitude, who demanded with repeated in&s;tances the
death of the pode&s;ta and his family, that this &s;hort re&s;pite
was of no avail, and only &s;erved to embitter their fate: they
were fir&s;t impri&s;oned, and then put to death, without di&s;tinc|tion
of &s;ex or age.</P>
<P>THE next &s;cene of the ma&s;&s;acre was exhibited at Teglio,
whither &s;ome of the con&s;pirators were di&s;patched from
Tirano: they were dre&s;&s;ed in red, as a &s;ignal to the inhabi|tants
that the ri&s;ing at Tirano had &s;ucceeded. The Catho|lics
&s;oon collected them&s;elves into a body, and repaired to
the church, where the Prote&s;tants were a&s;&s;embled for the ce|lebration
of divine &s;ervice. One of them levelled his piece
again&s;t the mini&s;ter, who was preaching; but mi&s;&s;ing his
<PB N="249" REF="258">
aim, the Prote&s;tants ro&s;e up, drove out the Catholics, and
barricadoed the doors. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins then climbed up to
the windows, and &s;hot from the out&s;ide upon the crouded
audience; the doors at length being bur&s;t open, all the
Prote&s;tants were put to the &s;word, excepting tho&s;e who re|nounced
their religion.</P>
<P>ANOTHER party of Catholics made their way towards
Sondrio, where the governor of the Valteline re&s;ided. That
magi&s;trate, being appri&s;ed of their de&s;ign, ordered the
inhabitants to take arms, and &s;ummoned the people of the
neighbouring di&s;trict to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: in obedience to this
injunction, both Prote&s;tants and Catholics began to a&s;&s;emble,
but the former were intercepted, and de&s;troyed. Some at|tempting
to e&s;cape towards Engadina and Pregalia were
overtaken in their flight, and involved in the common ruin.
Even the women laid a&s;ide the natural &s;oftne&s;s of their &s;ex,
and, hardened by &s;uper&s;tition, practi&s;ed every &s;pecies of out|rage
upon the bodies of the decea&s;ed. Mean while the
Catholic troops entered Sondrio, and exciting their parti&s;ans
with the cry of &startq;<HI>Down with the enemies of the Catholic faith!</HI>&endq;
made a general &s;laughter of the unhappy Prote&s;tants.
Mercy, however, was extended to the governor and his
family, in a manner which does honour to the chiefs of the
revolt who conducted the attack of Sondrio. He was fir&s;t
impri&s;oned, but afterwards, in con&s;ideration that he had al|ways
treated the Catholics with mildne&s;s, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with
his family, and e&s;corted in &s;afety to the confines of the
Valteline.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="259">
IT would be &s;hocking to humanity to enumerate all the
particulars of this &s;avage ma&s;&s;acre, or to trace its deva&s;tation
in the &s;everal towns of the Valteline. It continued, without
intermi&s;&s;ion, for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days; nor were its horrid
effects confined merely to tho&s;e who were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated upon
the &s;pot. Many who had e&s;caped into the country were
hunted down like wild bea&s;ts; others, after eluding the fury
of their pur&s;uers, were con&s;umed by hunger and fatigue;
and numerous dead bodies were di&s;covered in the woods,
caverns, and torrents. Several Catholics, who were allied
to the Prote&s;tants, &s;hared in the general di&s;a&s;ter; even women
and infants were &s;lain in the mo&s;t deliberate manner. Some
Prote&s;tants &s;aved their lives by abjuring their religion, and
many, who refu&s;ed to purcha&s;e their &s;afety by this con|ce&s;&s;ion,
were burnt alive. In the mid&s;t of this dreadful
carnage, one in&s;tance of &s;ingular humanity de&s;erves to be
recorded. Bartholemeo Peretti, the principal Catholic at
Berbeno, being exhorted to put all the Prote&s;tants of that
town to death, appri&s;ed them of their danger, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted
them in effecting an e&s;cape. But this act of clemency was
the occa&s;ion of his own de&s;truction, and he was executed as
an enemy to religion. All the Prote&s;tants being either de|&s;troyed
or driven out of the country, the remaining inhabi|tants
renounced their allegiance to the Gri&s;ons, and framing a
new form of government, threw them&s;elves under the protec|tion
of the king of Spain, who &s;ent an army to their &s;up|port.
The people of Bormio followed the example of the
Valteline, with this difference, that they did not ma&s;&s;acre,
but only expelled the Prote&s;tants. Having entered into an
offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive alliance with the inhabitants of this
<PB N="251" REF="260">
valley, they al&s;o erected them&s;elves into an independent com|monwealth.</P>
<P>THE Gri&s;ons, divided among them&s;elves, were totally un|equal
to the cha&s;ti&s;ement of their revolted &s;ubjects. The
Catholics were de&s;irous of employing the mediation of Spain,
for the purpo&s;e of recovering the Valteline; the Prote&s;tants,
inclined to vigorous mea&s;ures, propo&s;ed an application to
the Swi&s;s cantons, Venice, and France. After violent di&s;|&s;en&s;ions,
which were not terminated without blood&s;hed, the
Prote&s;tant intere&s;t prevailed, and a deputation was &s;ent to
the powers above-mentioned.</P>
<P>ZURIC and Berne in&s;tantly di&s;patched a body of troops,
while the Catholic cantons refu&s;ed to act again&s;t tho&s;e of the
&s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion with them&s;elves. Venice, alarmed at the
growing power of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and de&s;irous of a
pa&s;&s;age through the Valteline, gave a flattering an&s;wer to the
reque&s;t of the Gri&s;ons, but, with a &s;pirit of delay natural to a
republic, deferred &s;ending any actual &s;uccour. France too,
having ju&s;t emerged from a civil war, was more di&s;po&s;ed to ne|gociate
than to act with deci&s;ion. Ba&s;&s;ompiere was di&s;patched
to Madrid to &s;olicit the re&s;titution of the Valteline; and al|though
a league was concluded between the king of France,
the duke of Savoy, and the republic of Venice, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
Gri&s;ons unle&s;s the Valteline was re&s;tored; yet all that could
be obtained from the Spaniards was, that the forts of the
valley &s;hould be placed in the hands of the pope: but as the
pope was a &s;ecret parti&s;an of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and in|clined
to favour the rebellion of the Valteline, it was evi|dent
<PB N="252" REF="261">
that he would re&s;tore the forts to the Spaniards upon the
fir&s;t opportunity. In this interval the united troops of the
Gri&s;ons, Zuric, and Berne, being defeated with great
&s;laughter; the Valteline &s;eemed upon the point of being for
ever di&s;membered from the Gri&s;ons, when the French court
&s;uddenly changed its plan of operation, entered into the war
with a zeal as &s;incere as it was politic, and vigorou&s;ly inter|po&s;ed
in behalf of the Gri&s;ons.</P>
<P>THIS revolution in the French politics was owing to the
a&s;cendancy of Cardinal Richelieu, who no &s;ooner began to
pre&s;ide in the cabinet, than the kingdom &s;eemed to awake
from that deep lethargy, into which it had &s;unk during the
feeble admini&s;trations of Ancres and Luynes. That great
mini&s;ter in&s;tantly perceived the importance of the Valteline;
without wa&s;ting a moment in deliberation, he demanded an
immediate re&s;titution of that country, and enforced this
demand by &s;ending a detachment of troops to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the Gri&s;ons, under the command of the marquis de
Couvres. The general, animated with the &s;pirit of the new
mini&s;ter, penetrated into the&s;e parts; joined his army to the
Swi&s;s and Gri&s;ons, and in two campaigns drove the Spa|niards
from the Valteline, Chiavenna, and Bormio. The
two latter provinces were immediately re&s;tored; but when
the Gri&s;on deputies repaired to the French general at Sondrio,
to demand the ce&s;&s;ion of the Valteline, Couvres propo&s;ed,
that the exerci&s;e of the Prote&s;tant religion &s;hould be abo|li&s;hed
throughout the valley; that the inhabitants &s;hould
appoint their own magi&s;trates, and pay a yearly tribute of
20, 000 crowns; and he &s;hewed him&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly inclined
<PB N="253" REF="262">
to circum&s;cribe the authority of the Gri&s;ons over the inhabi|tants
of the Valteline, that he was &s;u&s;pected of being bribed
by the latter. But it &s;oon appeared, that this conduct was
occa&s;ioned by directions from his court, and proceeded from
a reconciliation, which, unknown to the Gri&s;ons, had taken
place between the kings of France and Spain.</P>
<P>RICHELIEU, the &s;oul of the French monarchy, having
now brought to maturity his project for &s;ubjugating the Hu|gonots,
was too great a politician to be embarra&s;&s;ed with a
foreign war at the eve of a civil commotion; and well aware,
that he could not maintain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Valteline without
an expence of troops, which he could ill &s;pare, tempori&s;ed
for the moment, and made overtures to Philip the Fourth.
Philip, harra&s;&s;ed by the long continuance of ho&s;tilities,
&s;eemed equally de&s;irous of an accommodation: accordingly
preliminaries of a new treaty were immediately adju&s;ted by
the contracting powers, at Mo&s;&s;on in Arragon. It was
agreed that the Valteline &s;hould again be re&s;tored to the
Gri&s;ons under the following conditions: that no other re|ligion
but the Roman Catholic &s;hould be tolerated; that
the inhabitants &s;hould elect their own governors and magi&s;|trates,
either from them&s;elves or from the Gri&s;ons, but always
from per&s;ons of the Roman Catholic per&s;ua&s;ion; that the
governors &s;hould be confirmed by the Gri&s;ons. In return
for the&s;e privileges, it was &s;tipulated that the inhabitants
&s;hould pay an annual tribute, the amount of which was to
be &s;ettled by mediation. In con&s;equence of this treaty,
concluded on the 5th of March, 1626, the French re&s;igned
<PB N="254" REF="263">
the forts of the Valteline into the hands of the pope, and
evacuated the country.</P>
<P>IN conformity to this alliance, the inhabitants having
elected Robu&s;telli, who began the ma&s;&s;acre, for their gover|nor,
and appointed twelve magi&s;trates, &s;ent a deputation to
Coire to demand the confirmation of the Gri&s;ons. The
Gri&s;ons, however, were by no means di&s;po&s;ed to accede to a
treaty &s;o de&s;tructive to the rights of &s;overeignty, which they
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over the Valteline. Openly excited by the Repub|lic
of Venice, and &s;ecretly encouraged by the French mini&s;|ter,
they refu&s;ed to acknowledge the treaty of Mo&s;&s;on. But
as they were not in a &s;tate to &s;upport their claims upon the
Valteline by force of arms, they could only remon&s;trate and
negociate, without producing any immediate effect.</P>
<P>AFFAIRS continued in this &s;tate for three years; until
Richelieu, having completed the reduction of the Hugonots
by the taking of Rochelle, found him&s;elf in a &s;ituation to
turn the whole force of France again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria;
the diminution of who&s;e power he had long meditated. He
now threw off the ma&s;k: the dominions of the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria were invaded on all &s;ides, and every part of Europe
became the theatre of his va&s;t de&s;igns. Among other enter|pri&s;es,
the Valteline engaged no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of his
attention. The duke of Rohan was di&s;patched to the
Gri&s;ons with a formidable army, and having wor&s;ted the
Spani&s;h troops in various encounters, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of
the Valteline.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="264">
UPON this deci&s;ive &s;ucce&s;s, the French abated much of
their &s;olicitude for the intere&s;ts of the Gri&s;ons; and although
they began the war with a po&s;itive demand of an uncondi|tional
re&s;titution of the Valteline, yet they were no &s;ooner
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, than they again profe&s;&s;ed, as on
the former conque&s;t, a great tenderne&s;s for the privileges of
the inhabitants. They refu&s;ed to &s;urrender their acqui&s;ition
to the Gri&s;ons, unle&s;s upon terms more favourable to the
people than had been offered even by the treaty of Mo&s;&s;on.
The Gri&s;ons having no pro&s;pect of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from any other
quarter, found them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of acceding to
the&s;e humiliating &s;tipulations. The French, with a view
probably of retaining the Valteline in their own hands, con|tinued
to delay its re&s;titution, and clogged every &s;ub&s;equent
negociation for that purpo&s;e with conditions &s;till more un|favourable.</P>
<P>THE Spaniards, artfully availing them&s;elves of the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
held out of the Gri&s;ons the mo&s;t flattering over|tures
of accommodation. Encouraged by the&s;e well-timed
offers, and incen&s;ed at the repeated in&s;tances of duplicity
they had lately experienced, the Gri&s;ons ro&s;e up in arms,
and drove the French from the Valteline. The treaty of
Milan was the con&s;equence of this revolution; a clo&s;e
alliance was concluded between the Spaniards and the Gri|&s;ons;
and the Valteline was re&s;tored, under the guarantie of
that very power, which had originally excited the inhabi|tants
to revolt. This treaty, contracted in the year 1635,
&s;ecured to the Spaniards the pa&s;&s;age of the valley, which
<PB N="256" REF="265">
had been the great object of the war, and re&s;tored the Val|teline,
Chiavenna, and Bormio, to the Gri&s;ons, under the
following articles: An act of oblivion; the immunities of
the &s;ubject countries to be confirmed as they exi&s;ted before
the revolution of 1620; no other religion but the Catholic to
be tolerated therein; no per&s;on of any other pe&s;ua&s;ion to be
permitted to re&s;ide, excepting the governors, during the
two years they &s;hould continue in office, and the Prote&s;tants
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lands, who &s;hould not be allowed to remain in
the country above three months in the year; the privileges
of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics to be re&s;tored in their full latitude.</P>
<P>A FEW alterations were made in the government of the
Valley, and &s;ome regulations introduced, for the purpo&s;e of
&s;temming the torrent of inju&s;tice and corruption, that
prevailed in the courts of ju&s;tice before the revolution: they
con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in a new method of nominating the gover|nors,
and in the creation of the office of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The ar|ticles
were guarantied by Spain, and in&s;erted in the capi|tulation,
or treaty, ratified in 1639, at Milan, in the pre&s;ence
of the deputies from the Valteline.</P>
<P>THE deputies reproached the Spaniards, for having &s;um|moned
them to Milan, in order to be pre&s;ent, in &s;ilence and
with tears, at the &s;ubver&s;ion of their liberty; and when the
treaty was announced to the inhabitants of the Valteline, a
general de&s;pair &s;pread it&s;elf through all ranks. The people
univer&s;ally lamented that they had been deluded into a revolt
under a promi&s;e of protection; that they had expended,
<PB N="257" REF="266">
during this fatal war, above twenty-five millions of florins<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Near &pound;. 2, 000, 000 &s;terling.</NOTE>,
for no other purpo&s;e than to procure an alliance between
Spain and the Gri&s;ons, and to be re&s;tored to their original
ma&s;ters, exa&s;perated by their revolt, and preparing to renew
the former acts of inju&s;tice and tyranny which had driven
them to rebellion. Nor were the&s;e murmurs ill-grounded;
for, except the total exclu&s;ion of the Prote&s;tant religion, no
material alteration was made in the fate of this valley. Since
this treaty the laws have been no le&s;s perverted than before,
the exactions of the governors have continued as exorbitant,
and the courts of ju&s;tice as iniquitous and corrupt. The
change in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice has proved no alle|viation;
the creation fo the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's office &s;erved only to
give the &s;anction of law to the mo&s;t iniquitous proceedings,
or to vary the mode of oppre&s;&s;ion. This innovation has
been moreover attended with this bad effect to the bulk of
the inhabitants, that whereas, before the rebellion, the
nobles were principally &s;ubject to the rapacity of the Gri&s;on
judges; &s;ince the pacification, the people have become
more expo&s;ed to exactions.</P>
<P>I HAVE thus brought down the hi&s;tory of the Valteline
to the pacification of 1637. Since that period no material
change has taken place in the &s;ituation of affairs. The &s;o|vereigns
of Milan have always cultivated the friend&s;hip of
the Gri&s;ons; and the inhabitants of this valley, having no
power to re&s;ort to for protection, have endured a regular
cour&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion under the government of a free &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 76.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GOVERNMENT OF THE VALTELINE.</HEAD>
<P>THE geographical divi&s;ion of the Valteline is into three
principal di&s;tricts, and the political into five govern|ments.
The three di&s;tricts are, 1. <HI>Terzero di Sopra,</HI> or the
Upper Di&s;trict. 2. <HI>Terzero di Mezzo,</HI> or the Middle Di&s;trict.
3. <HI>Terzero di Sotto,</HI> or the Lower Di&s;trict. The five govern|ments
are, 1. Of the Upper Di&s;trict. 2. Of the Middle Di&s;|trict,
called al&s;o the Government of Sondrio. 3. Of Teglio.
4. Of Morbegno. 5. Of Traona.</P>
<P>EACH of the&s;e five governments is &s;ubject to a magi&s;trate
appointed by the Gri&s;ons, who is changed every two years.
The magi&s;trate over the Middle Di&s;trict is called <HI>governor</HI> of
the Valteline, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in &s;ome re&s;pect a &s;uperior degree
of authority to the others, who are &s;tyled <HI>pode&s;tas.</HI> He is al&s;o
captain general of the Valteline.</P>
<P>BUT before I proceed to explain the form of government,
it may be nece&s;&s;ary to lay before you the method of electing
the governor and pode&s;tas, to whom the Gri&s;ons delegate
their authority over the Valteline. In the year 1602, the
venality and inju&s;tice of the&s;e magi&s;trates had ari&s;en to &s;uch
an exce&s;&s;ive height, that &s;ome remedy &s;eemed ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary. The cau&s;e of this inju&s;tice was evidently derived
<PB N="259" REF="268">
from the public &s;ale of the governments, and the &s;hare of the
fines for criminal offences, which were partly appropriated to
the Gri&s;ons, and partly to the governors<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is nece&s;&s;ary to appri&s;e the reader, that when I u&s;e the word <HI>governor</HI> &s;imply, I ap|ply it indi&s;criminately to the governor of the Valteline and the four pode&s;tas.</NOTE>. In order to pre|vent
corruption in the di&s;tribution of the offices, and exac|tion
in the governors, two important changes were made.
In&s;tead of one per&s;on being appointed to fill the vacant
office, four candidates were nominated by the community,
to whom the turn of election belonged, and the&s;e four drew
lots for the charge. But this alteration would have been at|tended
with few beneficial effects, if it had not been followed
by another, namely, that the &s;tipend of the governors &s;hould
be tripled, and that they &s;hould have no &s;hare in the fines:
yet the&s;e &s;alutary regulations, as they prevented the Gri&s;ons
from &s;elling the governments at &s;o high a price, were a few
years afterwards aboli&s;hed by the diet. In order, however,
to pre&s;erve &s;ome appearances of impartiality in the choice
of the magi&s;trates, it was &s;tipulated in the treaty of Milan,
that three candidates &s;hould be nominated by the community
to whom the election belongs, and that one of the&s;e &s;hould
be appointed by the diet. Yet this mode is a mere for|mality:
three are always pre&s;ented; but the diet never fails
to nominate the per&s;on recommended by the community.
The&s;e magi&s;tracies are allowed to be openly purcha&s;ed: in
general, part of the money is a&s;&s;igned to the public fund of
the community, and the remainder is di&s;tributed among the
body of the people, in whom the right of election is ve&s;ted,
and who&s;e votes are &s;eldom obtained without additional
<PB N="260" REF="269">
bribes. It will ea&s;ily be imagined what a dreadful &s;cene of<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>All authors, both natives and foreign|ers, who have written upon the Gri&s;ons, have not failed to enumerate the ill effects re&s;ulting from this &s;ale of governments, which is authori&s;ed by law; but none have expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;approbation in &s;tronger terms than Fortunatus Juvalta, in the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age, from a manu&s;cript account of the Gri&s;ons:</P>
<P>Qui ad honores et prae&s;ertim and quae&s;tuo|&s;as illus prae&s;ecturas a&s;pirabant, non aliter quam ambitu et largitionibus voti compotes &s;ierent. Omnia enim venalia pro&s;tabant, non $$$us ac aliae merces.</P>

frequently per&s;ons are appointed to the governments, who
are totally inadequate to the di&s;charge of their tru&s;t.</P>
<P>THESE magi&s;trates, as repre&s;entatives of the &s;overeign
&s;tate, enjoy the &s;upreme authority, and are entru&s;ted with
the power of life and death; and if they are apparently con|trolled
by the laws, they devi&s;e means to evade them. But
their authority will be be&s;t under&s;tood from a detail of
the civil and criminal courts of ju&s;tice e&s;tabli&s;hed in this
country.</P>
<P>THE criminal tribunal is compo&s;ed of the governor, vicar,
and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The governor arre&s;ts, impri&s;ons, and examines
the delinquent: though, according to the letter of the law,
no examination ought to be made but in the pre&s;ence of the
vicar and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The criminal being convicted, and the
$entence pa&s;&s;ed, the governor enjoys the power of remitting
<PB N="261" REF="270">
or dimini&s;hing the puni&s;hment, excepting in ca&s;es of high
trea&s;on, premeditated murder, or &s;uch enormous crimes.
He has a &s;mall annual &s;tipend paid by the Valteline, but
the chief part of his income is derived from the fines for
criminal offences, of which he receives two-thirds. In all
trials he is bound to follow the penal &s;tatutes, which are
drawn up with great preci&s;ion and clearne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE vicar is always a Gri&s;on; and he is cho&s;en by rota|tion
from the &s;everal communities, in the following man|ner:
Three candidates are pre&s;ented to the inhabitants of
the Valteline, who appoint one of them to the vacant office.
This mode was adopted in the treaty of 1639, in order to
check corruption, but it has not been attended with the de|&s;ired
effect. The community, in who&s;e turn it is to elect the
three candidates, leaves to the per&s;on who has purcha&s;ed the
office the power of nominating his two a&s;&s;ociates; and the
diet, in delivering in the three names, recommends the per|&s;on
who had been previou&s;ly de&s;igned by the community,
and this recommendation is always accepted by the Valteline.
The vicar ought to attend in per&s;on all trials when the go|vernor
examines the pri&s;oners; but this cu&s;tom is now
fallen into difu&s;e, and in lieu of his attendance, he receives an
annual &s;um of 1127 Gri&s;on florins, about &pound;. 83, from the
governor of the Valteline and each of the four pode&s;tas:
a &s;hameful elu&s;ion, as the vicar was de&s;igned to be a kind of
coun&s;el in favour of the pri&s;oner, and to prevent inju&s;tice
in the mode of examination. When the pri&s;oner is con|victed,
an account of the proce&s;s is laid before the vicar,
who mu&s;t confirm the &s;entence. Torture, for the purpo&s;e
<PB N="262" REF="271">
or forcing confe&s;&s;ion, cannot be inflicted without his con&s;ent,
and in his pre&s;ence, which is never di&s;pen&s;ed with. Be&s;ides
a &s;mall &s;alary, and the above-mentioned annual &s;um of 1127
florins, as a premium for not attending at the trials, he has a
&s;tated allowance, as well for every con&s;ultation, as for every
time that he is pre&s;ent at the infliction of torture.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or mu&s;t be an inhabitant of the Valteline: he is
nominated by the vicar from three candidates, cho&s;en reci|procally
from each of the three Terzeros. His vote is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to concur with the vicar in ordering torture: he mu&s;t
al&s;o attend when it is applied, and mu&s;t confirm the &s;entence
pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the convicted per&s;ons. He has no regular
&s;alary, but his profits depend upon the number of proce&s;&s;es
in which he is con&s;ulted. This is the only office which gives
to the inhabitants of the Valteline any &s;hare in the criminal
juri&s;prudence. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, according to the original inten|tion
of the &s;tatutes, ought to be a per&s;on well ver&s;ed in the
laws of the country, and &s;hould be con&s;idered as an advocate
for the accu&s;ed; but as he is obliged to the vicar for his no|mination
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">U&s;ually the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or either pays the vicar for his appointment, or el&s;e delivers him all his regular &s;ees of office.</NOTE>, he is commonly his creature, and &s;eldom gives
his vote in oppo&s;ition to him. Nor indeed is it yet a decided
point, whether the concurrence of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary for pa&s;&s;ing a definitive &s;entence. The ca&s;e is with|out
precedent, but was once very near being brought to a
deci&s;ion. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or differed from the opinion of the go|vernor
and vicar, and refu&s;ed to give his concurrence for the
<PB N="263" REF="272">
conviction and puni&s;hment of a criminal. In this dilemma
the affair was referred &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the two other can|didates
for the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or&s;hip, who had been pre&s;ented to the
vicar for his nomination. Notwith&s;tanding they agreed
with the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, it was &s;till di&s;puted whether the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as
a &s;ervant of the vicar, could act in direct oppo&s;ition to his
opinion, and prevail again&s;t him. The ca&s;e was &s;o extraor|dinary,
that it was propo&s;ed to appeal to the diet; but &s;ome
of the chief nobles of the Valteline, concluding, that the Gri|&s;ons
would decide in favour of their own repre&s;entatives, in|duced
the vicar to drop the appeal; and the affair was com|promi&s;ed
without coming to a deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>SUCH is the general theory of the criminal juri&s;prudence
in this country, by which it appears that the power of the
governor is limited as well by the &s;trict letter of the law, as
by the interference of the vicar and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, who&s;e concur|rence
is nece&s;&s;ary for pa&s;&s;ing a final &s;entence. But this li|mitation
exi&s;ts only in theory; for the laws are ea&s;ily eluded,
and even made &s;ub&s;ervient to the conviction of the innocent
as well as the guilty. The vicar and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, be they ever &s;o
upright, can hardly prevent the oppre&s;&s;ion of the judges;
and if they are them&s;elves rapacious, they receive their &s;hare
of the plunder, by conniving at the governor's inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>HAVING gained &s;ome in&s;ight into the practice of the
courts of ju&s;tice, I &s;hall lay before you the general mode of
proceeding, from arre&s;ting the criminal to his final &s;entence,
inter&s;per&s;ing the account with occa&s;ional remarks, which
<PB N="264" REF="273">
will &s;erve to &s;hew the abu&s;es introduced into the admini|&s;tration
of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE governor &s;ends out the order of arre&s;t, and commits
the criminal to pri&s;on. He detains him in confinement as
long as he plea&s;es, delaying or ha&s;tening the inquiry as he
thinks fit. The examination is &s;ecret, no one being pre&s;ent
but the governor, or his &s;ub&s;titute, and the notary, who
writes down the proce&s;s. It mu&s;t be evident to all, with how
much ea&s;e per&s;ons ver&s;ed in the arts of chicanery can brow|beat
the ignorant, and perplex the pri&s;oners, who are
allowed no coun&s;el. When the criminal is found guilty,
whatever is his crime, he may make a compo&s;ition with the
governor, before the ca&s;e is referred to the vicar; or, in
other words, as the examination is &s;ecret, the governor can
dre&s;s out the proce&s;s in the mo&s;t favourable manner, and
may give what explanation to the affair he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>IF no compo&s;ition is made, the ca&s;e is laid before the
vicar and the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, who are obliged to give their vote
according to the letter of the law; and as the &s;tatutes are
very &s;evere, the penalties are either heavy fines or corporal
puni&s;hment. In the former circum&s;tance, the governor re|ceives
two-thirds of the fine; and, as in the latter, he has the
power of remitting the puni&s;hment, excepting for the mo&s;t
atrocious crimes, he generally accepts a commutation in
money, if the pri&s;oner is able to pay it. By the&s;e means
mo&s;t offences may be ea&s;ily compounded for; a circum&s;tance
which empowers the rich to commit crimes with impunity.
It is, however, a matter of little con&s;equence to the governor
<PB N="265" REF="274">
whether the pri&s;oner is rich or poor: in the fir&s;t in&s;tance he
may receive a compo&s;ition from the pri&s;oner him&s;elf, in the
latter from the pari&s;h. For, in ca&s;e the puni&s;hment for
the crime is corporal, the expences attending it are con&s;ider|able,
as the executioner of Coire mu&s;t inflict it; for which
rea&s;on the governor generally remits the penalty, and re|ceives
from the pari&s;h a compo&s;ition in money, &s;omewhat
le&s;s than the expences of inflicting corporal puni&s;hment
would have been attended with.</P>
<P>WE may add to the li&s;t of grievances abovementioned,
the power po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the magi&s;trates of delegating their au|thority
without re&s;iding in the government. If the delegate
is a Gri&s;on, he is called <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tente,</HI> if an inhabitant of the Val|teline,
<HI>Tenente.</HI> He either purcha&s;es the fines and perqui&s;ites
upon a calculation of their average value, or is re&s;pon&s;ible
for them to the governor. In &s;ome places the delegation is
almo&s;t always bought by the &s;ame per&s;on, who re&s;ides upon
the &s;pot, and becomes as it were a perpetual judge. In
others a &s;ociety of per&s;ons join to purcha&s;e the profits of
the magi&s;tracy; they appoint the nominal delegate, and
&s;ecretly direct the proce&s;&s;es. Such a delegation may be
called a &s;ettled tyranny, and according to the expre&s;&s;ion of
an elegant author<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eden's Principles of Penal Law, p. 61.</NOTE>, &startq;<HI>e&s;tabli&s;hes a whole&s;ale traffic between
criminals and courts of ju&s;tice.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>FROM this general view of the criminal juri&s;prudence of
the Valteline, we may readily infer the wretched &s;ituation of
<PB N="266" REF="275">
the inhabitants; where the &s;upreme magi&s;trate purcha&s;es a
temporary office at an exorbitant price, and has an inadequate
&s;alary; where the principal profits of his charge ari&s;e from
the fines for criminal offences; where it is his intere&s;t to
arraign and to convict; and where he is him&s;elf the interpre|ter
of the laws, of which he is commonly ignorant, the ac|cu&s;er
of the party, and the judge.</P>
<P>I HAVE already mentioned the power which the governor
enjoys of pardoning all offences except the mo&s;t atrocious
crimes. A pardon of this &s;ort is called <HI>liberatione;</HI> and there
are printed papers that contain its form, in which blank
&s;paces are left for the name of the per&s;on, for the crime
committed, for the date, and for the &s;ignature of the judge.
I enclo&s;e a copy of a liberation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The following is the form of a liberation:

<P>Dat. in Tirano dal Pretorio que&s;to giorno anno</P></NOTE>: it brings to my recol|lection
tho&s;e acts of indulgence, which the Catholics obtain
<PB N="267" REF="276">
from Rome for the ab&s;olution of their &s;ins: with this differ|ence,
that the latter refers to a future &s;tate, the former
to this life. The price of the&s;e pardons varies according to
the magnitude of the crime, the condition of the per&s;on who
committed it, and more particularly the time in which it is
granted; for the &s;um is greater when a governor fir&s;t enters
upon his office, than when he is retiring from it. Some|times,
during the la&s;t two or three hours previous to the
expiration of the office, pardons may be procured at the
lowe&s;t rate; and I was a&s;&s;ured from very good authority,
that a liberation for homicide has not unfrequently been
obtained for about four-pence.</P>
<P>Do not &s;uppo&s;e that this account of the venality which
reigns throughout the Valteline is heightened, for I have
taken great pains to a&s;certain the truth, and it has been
confirmed to me by per&s;ons of all ranks, both in the Gri&s;on
and &s;ubject countries. Nor will you be led to imagine that
all the governors are equally rapacious and unju&s;t. Like the
Roman procon&s;uls, &s;ome carry their rapine to the height,
others are le&s;s exacting, and a few are free even from the
mo&s;t di&s;tant imputation of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE civil courts of ju&s;tice remain to be con&s;idered. Al|though
the governor pre&s;ides in the&s;e courts and pa&s;&s;es
&s;entence, yet by a &s;ingular privilege the cau&s;e is not always
le&s;t to his ab&s;olute deci&s;ion. He examines the witne&s;&s;es, and
makes out the proce&s;s; but, at the reque&s;t of either party,
the cau&s;e may be referred to an arbitrator, who is called
<HI>Savio.</HI> He is either nominated by the plaintiff and de&s;en|dant;
<PB N="268" REF="277">
or, if they cannot agree, is cho&s;en by lot in the fol|lowing
manner: The plaintiff and defendant appoint each
&s;ix per&s;ons; from the &s;ix appointed by the defendant the
plaintiff &s;elects one; the defendant nominates one of the
&s;ix cho&s;en by the plaintiff; and the&s;e two per&s;ons draw lots
who &s;hall be arbitrator. He then examines the acts of the
proce&s;s, gives his opinion, which is called in the &s;tatutes of
the country <HI>Il Con&s;iglio del Savio,</HI> and the governor is bound
to &s;ubmit to his deci&s;ion. The obligation of the governor to
follow the opinion of the arbitrator is &s;o &s;trong, that accord|ing
to the &s;tatutes, if he refu&s;es to pa&s;s &s;entence, the opinion
of the Savio is <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> a deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>FROM this deci&s;ion there lies an appeal to two arbitrators
called <HI>Probi,</HI> who are appointed by the parties in the manner
abovementioned: &s;hould they di&s;agree, then the two parties
amicably nominate a coun&s;ellor, who accedes to one of the
Probi; and this &s;entence is final, if it concurs with that of
the Savio; but otherwi&s;e, there lies a farther appeal either to
the &s;yndicate or diet, and ultimately to the &s;everal communi|ties
of the three leagues. When the governor decides in the
fir&s;t in&s;tance he receives three <HI>per cent.</HI> of the conte&s;ted pro|perty,
but only one <HI>per cent.</HI> when recour&s;e is had to arbi|tration,
the other two <HI>per cent.</HI> being paid to the Savio. By
this &s;ingular privilege of referring to arbitration in all cau&s;es
of property, the civil courts of ju&s;tice are not open to &s;uch
corruption as the criminal tribunals; and yet venality has
taken &s;o deep a root in the affairs of this unhappy country,
that bribery finds its way even into the civil tribunals.
When the civil cau&s;es are brought in the governor's court,
<PB N="269" REF="278">
and decided by him, without the intervention of the Savio
and Probi, there lies an appeal to the &s;yndicate, a body who&s;e
office I &s;hall now explain.</P>
<P>AT the end of every two years, when the magi&s;tracies
expire, &s;yndicates are appointed by the Republic of the
Gri&s;ons, for the purpo&s;e of inquiring into the admini&s;tration
of the &s;everal governors, and of hearing appeals from their
deci&s;ions. This court is compo&s;ed of nine members, includ|ing
the pre&s;ident; they are cho&s;en reciprocally by the com|munities,
three from each league. They make a circuit into
each of the &s;ubject provinces; &s;end out proclamations, that
they are ready to receive all accu&s;ations again&s;t the governors,
examine witne&s;&s;es, decide all appeals, and can mitigate all
fines impo&s;ed, without the concurrence of the vicar and
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. They do not, however, finally determine in civil
cau&s;es, in the la&s;t re&s;ort, which may be referred from their
deci&s;ion to the diet. The &s;yndicate, which was intended to
oppo&s;e corruption and inju&s;tice, is neverthele&s;s the great &s;up|port
of both. Nor can it be otherwi&s;e; for the &s;yndics pur|cha&s;e
their office from the &s;everal communities; and as
their &s;alary is very &s;mall, they can only reimbur&s;e them|&s;elves
by receiving bribes from the judges or from the appel|lants.
Their office is bought for a greater or &s;maller &s;um, as
there are more or le&s;s appeals of con&s;equence to be &s;ubmit|ted
to their arbitration. And what is pregnant with &s;till
greater abu&s;es, when a cau&s;e of great importance is to be re|ferred
to the &s;yndicate, the governors frequently purcha&s;e
from the &s;everal communities, in who&s;e right the election is
for that time ve&s;ted, the power of nominating the &s;yndics,
<PB N="270" REF="279">
and of cour&s;e appoint their own creatures. Hence this
court is become &s;o corrupt as to give ri&s;e to a proverb,
&startq;<HI>as venal as the &s;yndicate.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>HAVING thus endeavoured to draw a general &s;ketch of
the civil and criminal juri&s;prudence in this country, I &s;hall
now mention the dome&s;tic admini&s;tration of affairs. All
public concerns, which do not fall under the juri&s;diction of
the Gri&s;ons, are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and determined by a council compo&s;ed
of five repre&s;entatives, one from each di&s;trict, which meet as
occa&s;ion requires at Sondrio. Previous to its &s;itting, the public
notary writes to the &s;everal pari&s;hes of the five governments,
informing them of the bu&s;ine&s;s to be tran&s;acted: each pari&s;h
has its meeting, in which every hou&s;eholder po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a vote;
and each di&s;trict has its a&s;&s;embly compo&s;ed of deputies from
the &s;everal pari&s;hes, who choo&s;e the repre&s;entatives. In all
affairs of importance, the repre&s;entatives are bound to vote in
conformity to in&s;tructions received from their con&s;tituents,
and all tran&s;actions are decided by a majority of voices. The
council is empowered to demand a redre&s;s of grievances
from the Gri&s;ons, and to remon&s;trate again&s;t infractions of
the privileges granted to the inhabitants by the Capitulation
of Milan. The governor of the Valteline is pre&s;ent, but
has no vote.</P>
<P>THE tribute which the Valteline pays to the Gri&s;ons is &s;o
&s;mall, the &s;alaries of the governors &s;o incon&s;iderable, and all
duties &s;o trifling, that mo&s;t writers, who have had occa&s;ion
to mention this valley, have de&s;cribed it as the mo&s;t happy
and the lea&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed of all &s;ubject provinces; without re|flecting,
<PB N="271" REF="280">
that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages, the country
is annually drained of a &s;um very di&s;proportionate to the abi|lity
of the inhabitants. It is difficult to a&s;certain the exact
amount of this &s;um, as it ari&s;es chiefly from the &s;ecret as
well as public profits of the courts of ju&s;tice. But when we
con&s;ider that the greate&s;t part is procured by extortion; that
&s;carcely any di&s;tinction is made between innocence and
guilt; that great crimes are committed with impunity, and
petty offences are &s;everely puni&s;hed; we may add, that the
mode of exaction is more detrimental to the country than
the lo&s;s of the &s;pecie it&s;elf; ina&s;much as a corrupt admini&s;|tration
of ju&s;tice is the wor&s;t of all oppre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE clergy of the Valteline are not re&s;pon&s;ible to the or|dinary
courts of ju&s;tice, their immunities being &s;o exorbitant
as to render them almo&s;t independent of the civil authority.
They are only amenable to the court of the bi&s;hop of Como.
If a prie&s;t is guilty of any mi&s;demeanor, his per&s;on cannot
be &s;ecured without the concurrence of the bi&s;hop, and go|vernor
of the di&s;trict in which the crime was committed.
It is therefore extremely difficult to bring an eccle&s;ia&s;tic to
ju&s;tice, as impunity is ea&s;ily purcha&s;ed, either by &s;ecuring
the favour of the bi&s;hop's vicar or of the magi&s;trate. Nor
are the&s;e pernicious privileges confined merely to the clergy,
but extend to all per&s;ons wearing an eccle&s;ia&s;tical dre&s;s, by
the permi&s;&s;ion of the bi&s;hop of Como.</P>
<P>THE Gri&s;ons have frequently endeavoured to annihilate
the&s;e immunities, but always without effect. The nobles of
the Valteline are intere&s;ted to &s;upport the privileges of the
<PB N="272" REF="281">
clergy, becau&s;e they can ea&s;ily procure the permi&s;&s;ion of
wearing the eccle&s;ia&s;tical dre&s;s, and becau&s;e they can &s;ecure
their property, by leaving their e&s;tates to the clergy at the
extinction of all the heirs named in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Such
e&s;tates, called <HI>beneficia gentilitia,</HI> are very common in the
Valteline, and cannot be &s;eized for debt, or confi&s;cated.
All civil cau&s;es of the clergy, below the value of two
hundred livres<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sixty-four Valteline livres = a pound &s;terling.</NOTE>, are decided by the vicar of the bi&s;hop of
Como: above that &s;um they are brought before the bi&s;hop.
An appeal from his deci&s;ion lies to the pope's nuncio at Lu|cern,
from him to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical tribunal at Aquilea, and
from thence to Rome.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TEGLIO&mdash;SONDRIO&mdash;ANECDOTES OF THE PAINTER
LIGARIO&mdash;MORBEGNO&mdash;DELEBIO.</HEAD>
<P>INSTEAD of proceeding by the neare&s;t road from Ti|rano
to Sondrio, I made a circuit by Teglio, pa&s;&s;ed
over the plain of Tirano, rich in all the productions of
nature, and continued for &s;ome way at the foot of the nor|thern
ridge of mountains, which are highly cultivated to
their very &s;ummits. Lower towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and
further towards the north-ea&s;t, the tops of the rugged Alps
make their appearance, gli&s;tening with &s;now. The country
was a continued vineyard, and the &s;oil is &s;o fertile, that corn,
millet, flax, and hemp, are &s;own among the vines, which
hang over them in beautiful fe&s;toons. Every village is
adorned with a thick grove of che&s;nut-trees, who&s;e rich and
dark foliage produces a plea&s;ing effect.</P>
<P>TEGLIO, the capital of the government of the &s;ame
name, is &s;ituated upon the top of a mountain, about mine
miles from Tirano, and twelve from Sondrio. It is a long
&s;traggling place, and contains about three hundred hou&s;es.
Clo&s;e to the town are the ruins of a fortre&s;s &s;tanding upon
an in&s;ulated rock, and formerly e&s;teemed of great &s;trength.
This elevated &s;pot commands a very rich and exten&s;ive
pro&s;pect from Tiano to the lower part of the valley beyond
Sondrio, as far as Morbegno. The government of Teglio is
<PB N="274" REF="283">
&s;aid to compri&s;e the twelfth part of the Valteline: it is the
mo&s;t populous di&s;trict, and contains about eight thou&s;and
&s;ouls. It produces in a good &s;ea&s;on much more corn than is
&s;ufficient for the con&s;umption of its inhabitants, and rivals
Sondrio and Tirano in the goodne&s;s of its wine. Finding
little at Teglio but the face of the country to excite curio&s;ity,
I proceeded in my journey to Sondrio, through a tract
highly cultivated, and de&s;cended by a gentle &s;lope to the bed
of the Adda, which roars through the plain, &s;ometimes con|fined
in a narrow channel, &s;ometimes expanding it&s;elf in a
wider bed, and threatening the country with continual
inundations.</P>
<P>SONDRIO is the capital of the valley, the re&s;idence of
the governor of the Valteline and of the vicar; but, like all
the towns in this valley, it has a de&s;erted a&s;pect: there is
little appearance of trade, and no animation. The town,
partly built in a plain, and partly upon the &s;ides of a rock, is
placed in a very romantic &s;ituation, at the extremity of a nar|row
valley, and occupies both &s;ides of the Malenco, a furious
torrent which frequently overflows its banks. Many of the
hou&s;es are very ancient; for I ob&s;erved the arms of the Vi&s;|conti,
formerly the &s;overeigns of this country, painted upon
their walls; the&s;e arms, repre&s;enting an enormous &s;erpent
cru&s;hing a man between his teeth, are too remarkable to
e&s;cape ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>THE Valteline, from its neighbourhood to Italy, has im|bibed
a ta&s;te for the fine arts, and there are many collections
of pictures which are not unworthy of notice. This
<PB N="275" REF="284">
country, however, has produced few arti&s;ts of any eminence.
Pietro Ligario is almo&s;t the only painter who de&s;erves to be
mentioned, and his name is &s;carcely known beyond the li|mits
of the Valteline.</P>
<P>LIGARIO was born at Sondrio in 1686, of the ancient fa|mily
of Ligario, which took its name from a neighbouring
village of that appellation. Having di&s;covered a lively ge|nius,
and a ta&s;te for the elegant arts, he was &s;ent when very
young to Rome, under the care of Lazaro Baldi, from whom
he learnt that exactne&s;s of de&s;ign which characteri&s;es the
Roman &s;chool. From thence he repaired to Venice, where
he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in &s;tudying that exqui&s;ite colouring,
for which the Venetian ma&s;ters are &s;o remarkably di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.
He made him&s;elf fir&s;t known at Milan, where he
met with &s;ome encouragement; and in 1727 he returned to
the Valteline. He found, however, but little employment,
until he was honoured with the patronage of Count De&s;alis,
Envoy from Great Britain to the Republic of the Gri&s;ons.
As he ro&s;e in reputation, his bu&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed; but, being
always very poor, he was frequently compelled to fini&s;h his
productions with &s;uch ha&s;te, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to
give all of them that perfection, which he was capable of
be&s;towing. Hence ari&s;es that inequality which is &s;o remark|able
in his paintings.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;carcely a church in the Valteline which does
not po&s;&s;e&s;s one of his pictures: the mo&s;t capital of his pieces
are the martyrdom of St. Gregory, in one of the churches at
Sondrio, and St. Benedict, in the chapel of a nunnery near
<PB N="276" REF="285">
the town. The&s;e were his late&s;t performances; and as they
were, contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, fini&s;hed with great la|bour
and exactne&s;s, may be con&s;idered as the te&s;t, from
which we ought to e&s;timate his abilities as a painter. The
figures are well grouped, the principal characters di&s;tinctly
marked, and the expre&s;&s;ion of the heads is admirable: the
&s;tyle of colouring is lively without being gaudy, and cha&s;te
without being dull. A few days after he had painted St. Be|nedict,
he was &s;eized with a violent fever, and expired in
1752, in the 67th year of his age.</P>
<P>LIGARIO is de&s;cribed by the connoi&s;&s;eurs as a painter
who united correctne&s;s of de&s;ign to beauty of colouring.
He is remarkable for grouping his figures to the be&s;t advan|tage,
and his heads are drawn with a noble &s;implicity. He is,
however, repre&s;ented as too much inclined to an imitation of
the antique: his figures often re&s;emble &s;tatues; and the
folds of his drapery fall with too much preci&s;ion, like the wet
drapery in the &s;culpture of the ancients. The character of
his faces is chiefly Grecian; but it is remarked, that they are
too &s;imilar to each other, and look like the portraits of per|&s;ons
who are of the &s;ame family; a circum&s;tance not un|u&s;ual
to tho&s;e, who too &s;ervilely copy the antique.</P>
<P>BESIDE painting, Ligario was &s;killed in mu&s;ic, mecha|nics,
and agriculture, and has left behind him &s;pecimens of
no ordinary acquaintance with each of tho&s;e arts. He made,
for his own amu&s;ement, an organ of very large dimen|&s;ions,
and con&s;tructed a clock with a cylindrical pendulum,
remarkable for the accuracy of its movements. He was fond
<PB N="277" REF="286">
of rearing plants and &s;imples, and was &s;o much attached to
the &s;tudy of agriculture, that he wrote in&s;tructions to his
family, upon the cheape&s;t and be&s;t method of cultivation.
He endeavoured to infu&s;e into his &s;on and daughter, Cae&s;ar
and Victoria, a fondne&s;s for the polite arts. They both
followed their father's profe&s;&s;ion, but although not without
&s;ome degree of merit, they failed of equalling his reputa|tion.
Victoria was chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed for her &s;kill in vocal
and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>I RODE this morning to &s;ee the painting of St. Benedict,
at the nunnery about a mile and an half from Sondrio. The
abbe&s;s, hearing that a foreigner was in the chapel, &s;ent a
me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring the favour of my company. Upon enter|ing
the parlour, I made my obei&s;ance to the abbe&s;s, who, in
company with two nuns, was &s;eated on the other &s;ide of the
grate. After the u&s;ual compliments, and inquiries if the pic|ture
plea&s;ed me, wine and cakes were brought in. The wine
was the produce of their own vineyards, and was excellent.
The cakes were &s;haped like &s;kulls and bones.</P>
<P>THE abbe&s;s and her companions behaved with great ea&s;e
and politene&s;s; a&s;ked many que&s;tions relating to England,
natural to per&s;ons &s;eque&s;tered from &s;ociety; and one of
them apologized for their curio&s;ity, by remarking, that wo|men
were not le&s;s inqui&s;itive or le&s;s fond of talking, becau&s;e
they were &s;hut up in a nunnery. The per&s;on who made this
remark was pale, but not unhealthy; her figure was re|markably
fine, and &s;he had been very hand&s;ome; a di&s;ap|pointment
in love, as I am informed, fir&s;t induced her to
<PB N="278" REF="287">
take the veil, and to bury &s;o much beauty and elegance in a
convent. Struck with her manner and addre&s;s, I could not
help wi&s;hing &s;he may never live to regret &s;uch a &s;tep, and
that &s;he may feel all that ea&s;e and tranquillity of mind,
which are expected, but not always found, by tho&s;e who
take the veil.</P>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned to Sondrio, from a &s;mall excur&s;ion to
Morbegno and towards the extremity of the Valteline as far
as Delebio. Near Sondrio the valley is about two miles in
breadth, and remarkably fertile in vines and all kinds of
grain. The right-hand chain of mountains is clothed al|mo&s;t
from the bottom to its &s;ummit with a continued vine|yard,
which is e&s;teemed to yield the be&s;t wine in the Valte|line.
I rode along the plain which &s;tretches, without inter|ruption,
from Sondrio to the lake of Como. The middle
part of this plain is occupied, and frequently overflowed
by the unruly Adda, and being mar&s;hy yields nothing but
coar&s;e pa&s;turage. The &s;ides ri&s;e gradually into gentle accli|vities,
and di&s;play a rich variety of natural productions.</P>
<P>MORBEGNO lies on the left &s;ide of the Adda, at the foot
of the &s;outhernmo&s;t chain. It is the hand&s;ome&s;t town in the
Valteline, and appears to have more &s;hops, and to carry on
more trade, than all the others united. Mr. Planta the
pre&s;ent pode&s;ta of Morbegno, no &s;ooner heard of my ar|rival,
than he politely waited upon me at the inn, and in|vited
me to his hou&s;e. Finding that I was de&s;irous of pro|ceeding
to Delebio, he in&s;i&s;ted upon accompanying me; and
having ordered his carriage without delay, propo&s;ed an im|mediate
<PB N="279" REF="288">
departure, that we might return to his hou&s;e by
&s;upper. Mr. Planta is the &s;ame per&s;on to whom I was obliged
for &s;o ho&s;pitable a reception at his hou&s;e at Cernetz; and it
gives me much &s;atisfaction to hear from all quarters, that he
may be reckoned among the few who act with honour and in|tegrity
in this land of extortion. When vicar of the Valteline,
he di&s;charged the duties of that important office with great
credit, and has entered upon his government with the &s;ame
&s;pirit of integrity. There is a plea&s;ure in receiving acts of
politene&s;s in a foreign country; but it is a double &s;atisfaction
to be obliged to per&s;ons who&s;e characters are de&s;erving of
the highe&s;t e&s;teem.</P>
<P>THE road from Morbegno to Delebio runs along the foot
of the chain of mountains, which &s;eparate the Valteline from
the Venetian territories. This chain having a northern a&s;|pect
yields few vines, but is richly clad with hanging groves
of che&s;nut-trees, chequered with meadows and fields of corn.
The Valteline expands gradually as we advanced towards
the lake of Como: in this part the whole plain is chiefly a
mora&s;s, expo&s;ed to the inundations of the Adda, which flows
through it in a wide channel. The &s;ilk, which begins to be
of great importance in the trade of this valley, is chiefly
exported from Delebio, through Chiavenna, into Germany.
Upon my return to Morbegno, I &s;upped with Mr. Planta, and
after the repa&s;t was entertained with an excellent concert.
In my return to Sondrio, I cro&s;&s;ed the Adda oppo&s;ite Mor|begno,
over a hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge, and proceeded along
a road carried at the foot, and along the &s;ides of the northern
chain of mountains. It was almo&s;t a continued vineyard,
<PB N="280" REF="289">
with millet, Turki&s;h corn, flax, and hemp, growing between
the ranges of vines.</P>
<P>THE romantic beauties of the Valteline are greatly
heightened by the numerous remains of ancient fortre&s;&s;es
and ca&s;tles &s;cattered throughout the country. They were all
di&s;mantled &s;oon after the capitulation of Milan<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 89.</NOTE>, from a
recent experience, that the inability of the Gri&s;ons to
provide them with &s;ufficient garri&s;ons, expo&s;ed them to the
enemy, and rendered them for the mo&s;t part of &s;ource
of annoyance rather than of protection. It might be ima|gined,
that &s;ome of the&s;e fortre&s;&s;es ought to have been re|tained
for the purpo&s;e of awing the inhabitants: &s;uch an
ab&s;olute confidence, however, is repo&s;ed by the Gri&s;ons in
the guaranty of the country by the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, that
they do not maintain a &s;ingle &s;oldier throughout the whole
Valteline.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">COMMERCE&mdash;PRODUCTIONS&mdash;POPULATION&mdash;OF THE
VALTELINE.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief commerce of the Valteline is carried on
with Milan and the Gri&s;ons. The principal exports
of the country are wine and &s;ilk, which turn the balance of
trade in its favour: they enable the inhabitants to exi&s;t with|out
any manufactures, and help to &s;upply the money which
is exacted by the governors.</P>
<P>THE wine is &s;ent into the Gri&s;ons, Germany, the Venetian
&s;tates, Bormio, and occa&s;ionally to Milan. Upon a rough
calculation 73, 000 &s;oma, or hor&s;e-loads, are annually ex|ported:
this year the &s;oma &s;old for a pound &s;terling, which
may be con&s;idered its average value. The &s;ilk is &s;ent to Eng|land,
Zuric, and Ba&s;le. The di&s;trict of Delebio and Talo|mara
produces the fine&s;t &s;ilk, the neighbourhood of Sondrio
the next in quality, and the di&s;trict of Tirano &s;upplies an
inferior &s;ort. Three thou&s;and pound of the fine&s;t &s;ort,
which is e&s;teemed as good as the &s;ilk procured from Pied|mont,
is &s;ent annually to England by way of O&s;tend. The
greate&s;t part of the &s;ilk is wound in the Valteline, for which
purpo&s;e there are &s;ilk mills in the principal di&s;tricts. Be&s;ides
the&s;e commodities, the Valteline exports planks, chee&s;e,
butter, and cattle. The inhabitants receive from Milan
<PB N="282" REF="291">
corn, rice, &s;alt, &s;ilken &s;tuffs; from Germany and Switzerland
cloth and linen; from Genoa &s;pices, coffee, and &s;ugar.
There are no manufactures in the Valteline, and almo&s;t all
the menial trades are exerci&s;ed by foreigners.</P>

<P>THE cottages of the pea&s;ants, which are built of &s;tone,
are large, but gloomy, generally without gla&s;s windows: I
entered &s;everal, and was every where di&s;gu&s;ted with an
uniform appearance of dirt and poverty. The pea&s;ants are
mo&s;tly covered with rags, and the children have u&s;ually an
unhealthy look, which ari&s;es from their wretched manner
of living. Such a &s;carcity of provi&s;ions has been occa&s;ioned
by la&s;t year's drought, that the poor inhabitants have been
reduced to the mo&s;t extreme nece&s;&s;ity. The price of bread
was unavoidably rai&s;ed &s;o high, that in many parts the pea|&s;ants
could not purcha&s;e it; and their only food was for
&s;ome time a kind of pa&s;te, made by pounding the hulls and
&s;tones of the grapes which had been pre&s;&s;ed for wine, and
mixing it with a little meal. Famine, added to their op|pre&s;&s;ed
&s;ituation, reduced the inhabitants to the lowe&s;t con|dition
<PB N="283" REF="292">
of human mi&s;ery, and numbers peri&s;hed from ab&s;olute
want. But it is a plea&s;ure to reflect that they are in &s;ome
mea&s;ure relieved by the plentiful harve&s;t of the pre&s;ent
year.</P>
<P>PERHAPS no part of Europe is more fruitful than the
Valteline, and yet there is no country in which the pea&s;ants
are more wretched. Many rea&s;ons are to be a&s;&s;igned for the
mi&s;ery to which they are reduced. The fir&s;t and principal
cau&s;e is the form of government. The governors, as I have
&s;hewn in a former letter, generally abu&s;e the exorbitant
authority entru&s;ted to them by the laws, the pea&s;ants are
impri&s;oned upon the &s;lighte&s;t information; and as all tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions
are puni&s;hed by fines, an accu&s;ed per&s;on is &s;eldom
found innocent; &s;o that a con&s;iderable number of pea&s;ants
are annually ruined in the courts of ju&s;tice. Be&s;ide the in|dividuals
who are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;uffer for their own guilt, the
pari&s;hes are &s;ubject to continual a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, towards defray|ing
the expences for the trial and impri&s;onment of the poor
pari&s;hioners: if the latter are unable to pay the &s;um re|quired,
it is demanded from the pari&s;h to which the criminal
belongs. In this ca&s;e it frequently happens, that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ments,
in&s;tead of being laid upon the landholders, are im|po&s;ed
upon each hearth, by which means the chief burden
falls upon the poor.</P>
<P>ANOTHER cau&s;e of wretchedne&s;s proceeds from the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of property. Few of the pea&s;ants are land|holders;
as from the continual oppre&s;&s;ion under which the
people have groaned for above the&s;e two la&s;t centuries, the
<PB N="284" REF="293">
freeholds have gradually fallen into the hands of the nobles
and Gri&s;ons, the latter of whom are &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s half
the e&s;tates in the Valteline. The tenants who take farms
do not pay their rent in money, but in kind; a &s;trong proof
of general poverty. The pea&s;ant is at all the co&s;ts of cul|tivation,
and delivers near half the produce to the landholder.
The remaining portion would ill compen&s;ate his labour and
expence, if he was not in &s;ome mea&s;ure befriended by the
fertility of the &s;oil. The ground &s;eldom lies fallow, and
the riche&s;t parts of the valley produce two crops. The fir&s;t
crop is wheat, rye, or &s;pelt, half of which is delivered to the
proprietor; the &s;econd crop is generally millet, buck-wheat,
maaze, or Turkey corn, which is the principal nouri&s;h|ment
of the common people: the chief part of this crop
belongs to the pea&s;ant, and enables him in a plentiful year
to &s;upport his family with &s;ome degree of comfort. The
pea&s;ants who inhabit the di&s;tricts which yield wine are the
mo&s;t wretched: for the trouble and charge of rearing the
vines, of gathering and pre&s;&s;ing the grapes, is very con&s;ide|rable;
and they are &s;o very apt to con&s;ume the &s;hare of
liquor allotted to them in intoxication, that, were it not for
the grain intermixed with the vines, they and their families
would be left almo&s;t entirely de&s;titute of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>BESIDES the bu&s;ine&s;s of agriculture, &s;ome of the pea|&s;ants
attend to the cultivation of &s;ilk. For this purpo&s;e they
receive the eggs from the landholder, rear the &s;ilk-worms,
and are entitled to half the &s;ilk. This employment is not
unprofitable; for although the rearing of the &s;ilk-worms is
attended with much trouble, and requires great caution, yet
<PB N="285" REF="294">
as the occupation is generally entru&s;ted to the women, it
does not take the men from their work. With all the ad|vantages,
however, derived from the fertility of the &s;oil,
and the variety of its productions, the pea&s;ants cannot, with|out
the utmo&s;t difficulty, and a con&s;tant exertion, maintain
their families; and they are always reduced to the greate&s;t
di&s;tre&s;s, whenever the &s;ea&s;on is unfavourable to agriculture.</P>
<P>To the cau&s;es of penury among the lower cla&s;&s;es above
enumerated, may be added the natural indolence of the
people, and their tendency to &s;uper&s;tition, which takes
them from their labour. Upon the whole, I have not, in
the cour&s;e of my travels, &s;een any pea&s;antry, except in
Poland, &s;o comfortle&s;s as the inferior inhabitants of this
valley. They enjoy indeed one great advantage over the
Poles, in not being the ab&s;olute property of the landholder,
and transferable, like cattle. They are therefore at liberty
to live where they chu&s;e, to quit their country, and &s;eek a
better condition in other regions; a relief to which di&s;tre&s;s
often compels them to have recour&s;e.</P>

<P>I QUITTED Sondrio ye&s;terday after dinner, and went up
the valley of Malenco; yielding vines, che&s;nut-trees, rye,
oats, and pa&s;turage. The &s;ides of the mountains were
clothed with birch and firs; and their &s;ummits produced
nothing but a &s;canty herbage. The inhabitants of this
valley appear healthier, better clothed, and more indu&s;trious,
than the other pea&s;ants of the Valteline. In con&s;equence
of their di&s;tance from the &s;eat of government, or of being
<PB N="286" REF="295">
in general too poor to excite the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of the Gri&s;on
governors, they are, perhaps, le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed, and for the mo&s;t
part po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;mall portion of land. The valley is narrow,
and watered by a torrent, which forms a continued cataract.
The road is a faint path, by the &s;ide of a precipice, and car|ried
over huge fragments of rocks. I pa&s;&s;ed the night in a
&s;olitary hut at the bottom of the Muret; the next morning
mounted a rugged a&s;cent in the channel of a &s;mall &s;tream;
ob&s;erved nothing but bare rocks, without the lea&s;t appear|ance
of vegetation; came to the top of the Muret, and pa&s;&s;ed
over a large ma&s;s of &s;now and ice.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e alpine &s;ituations the traveller &s;ees, within the
&s;pace of a few hours, nature in all her &s;hapes. In the Valte|line
&s;he is rich and fertile; here &s;he is barren and &s;tupendous.
The&s;e regions are &s;o dreary and de&s;olate, that if it were not
for an occa&s;ional traveller, the flights of a few &s;trange birds,
the goats brow&s;ing on the rugged alps, and the &s;hepherds
who tend them, nature would appear quite inanimate. In
the&s;e elevated &s;pots, while
<Q>&startq;Placed above the &s;torm's career,&endq;</Q>
I noticed the plea&s;ing effect produced by the vapours and
mi&s;ts floating in mid-air beneath me; circum&s;tances finely
felt and de&s;cribed by the author of The Min&s;trel.</P>
<Q><L>&startq;And oft the craggy cliff he lov'd to climb,</L>

<P>FROM the top of the Muret I de&s;cended about three hours
a craggy, de&s;olate, and uninhabited country; and noticed the
gradual increa&s;e of vegetation as I approached the road leading
to Chiavenna, a little above Ca&s;azza. This pa&s;&s;age over the
Muret, which &s;erves for the tran&s;portation of wine and other
merchandi&s;e from the Valteline to the Gri&s;ons, is only open
about five months in the year.</P>

OF ST. GULIELMO.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Chiavenna, <DATE>Sept. 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY corre&s;pondence with you has been for &s;ome time
interrupted by a di&s;order which has detained me in
the&s;e parts above &s;ix weeks. The day after my arrival from
the Valteline, I was &s;eized with a la&s;&s;itude, which I attri|buted
to the fatigue of the journey; it ended in a violent
pain and &s;welling of my right-hand, the effects of a rheu|mati&s;m,
which probably &s;eized me the night I pa&s;&s;ed at the
bottom of the Muret: not being able to procure a bed, I &s;lept
in the hay-loft, and &s;uffered much from the piercing north
wind, which blew from the glacier. I likewi&s;e imprudently
walked the next morning, without intermi&s;&s;ion or refre&s;h|ment,
for the &s;pace of &s;even hours, from the top of the
Muret to Bondo, &s;o that the cold and fatigue brought on
a rheumatic complaint, which has detained me here &s;ix
weeks. During great part of the time I wore my arm in a
&s;ling, and was incapable of writing a line. What I mo&s;t re|gret
in this delay is, my having been prevented from being
pre&s;ent at the general diet of the Gri&s;ons, which was held at
Davos the latter end of la&s;t month.</P>
<P>THE county of Chiavenna came under the &s;overeignty
of the Gri&s;ons in the &s;ame manner and at the &s;ame time with
<PB N="289" REF="298">
the Valteline. During the war of the Valteline it frequently
changed its ma&s;ters, but at the peace of Milan was finally
re&s;tored to the Gri&s;ons. It is ruled, like the other &s;ubject
provinces, by a Gri&s;on governor, who is called Commi&s;&s;ary,
and who in a few in&s;tances is even le&s;s limited in his power
than the judges of the Valteline.</P>
<P>THE criminal court of ju&s;tice is formed by the commi&s;|&s;ary
and the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is appointed by the com|mi&s;&s;ary,
from three candidates nominated by the county.
He mu&s;t attend all examinations, concur in ordering torture
for the conviction of a criminal, be pre&s;ent when it is in|flicted,
and ratify the final &s;entence: but as the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or
owes his place to the commi&s;&s;ary, and &s;hares in his ex|actions,
he is a mere cypher, and never ventures to exert his
right of interpo&s;ing a negative. This circum&s;tance renders
the courts of ju&s;tice in Chiavenna more uniformly iniquitous
than even tho&s;e of the Valteline: for the clo&s;e union be|tween
the commi&s;&s;ary and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or almo&s;t precludes the
chance of redre&s;s, and gives unbounded &s;cope to oppre&s;&s;ion.
It would be unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the mode of proceeding
e&s;tabli&s;hed in this court of ju&s;tice, as it is &s;imilar to that of
the Valteline. In civil cau&s;es the commi&s;&s;ary receives five
<HI>per cent.</HI> of the conte&s;ted property; and an appeal from his
deci&s;ion may be &s;ubmitted to the &s;yndicate.</P>
<P>CHIAVENNA, the capital of the county, is &s;ituated at the
foot and upon the &s;ide of a mountain, and contains about
3, 000 &s;ouls. The inhabitants carry on but little commerce.
The principal article of exportation (excepting the &s;tone pots
<PB N="290" REF="299">
mentioned in a former letter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 69.</NOTE>) is raw &s;ilk. The whole
country produces about 3, 600 pounds of that commodity.
A manufacture of &s;ilk &s;tockings, the only one in the town,
has been lately e&s;tabli&s;hed. The neighbouring country is
covered with vineyards; but the wine is meagre, and only a
&s;mall quantity is exported. The great &s;upport of Chiavenna
is the tran&s;port of merchandi&s;e, this town being the prin|cipal
place of communication between the Milane&s;e and
Germany. From hence the goods are &s;ent either by Coire
into Germany, or through Pregalia and the Engadinas into
the Tyrol. There is a duty laid by the Gri&s;ons upon all the
merchandi&s;e which pa&s;&s;es through Chiavenna; but this duty
is &s;o &s;mall, that the whole cu&s;toms, including tho&s;e in the
Valteline, are farmed for 17, 000 florins, or about &pound;. 1260
<HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P>THE principal object of curio&s;ity in the environs of Chia|venna
is the fortre&s;s in ruins, &s;eated upon the &s;ummit of a
rock, which overlooks the town, and celebrated in the
hi&s;tory of the Gri&s;ons for its almo&s;t impregnable &s;trength.
The only road which leads up to it is &s;teep and craggy.
The walls occupy a large &s;pace of ground, and are now
partly covered with vines. The &s;tronge&s;t part of the fortre&s;s
was con&s;tructed upon an in&s;ulated rock, rent, as &s;ome per|&s;ons
conjecture, by a violent convul&s;ion of nature, from the
contiguous mountain. It is on all &s;ides ab&s;olutely perpen|dicular,
and its only communication with the ca&s;tle was
formed by a draw-bridge thrown acro&s;s the intervening
<PB N="291" REF="300">
cha&s;m. Others<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We may, perhaps, reconcile the&s;e two opinions, by admitting that the opening was originally occa&s;ioned by a violent convul&s;ion of nature, but was afterwards enlarged and fa&s;hioned by art.</NOTE> &s;uppo&s;e the &s;eparation of this rock from the
remaining part of the fortre&s;s to have been the work of art,
and affirm, that it was excavated in 1343, by order of Galeaz|zo
Vi&s;conti. Its length is above 250 feet, its height about
200, and its greate&s;t di&s;tance from the adjoining rock about
20 feet. This fortification, though always deemed impreg|nable,
has been taken at different periods, &s;ometimes by
a&s;&s;ault, but more frequently by famine or &s;tratagem. It was
finally demoli&s;hed by the Gri&s;ons them&s;elves.</P>
<P>CLOSE to Chiavenna is a rock of a&s;be&s;tos, a &s;pecies of mi|neral
&s;ub&s;tance, of a greyi&s;h &s;ilver colour, which can be
drawn into longitudinal fibres as fine as thread, and is &s;up|po&s;ed
to be inde&s;tructible by fire; the ancients manufactured
it into a &s;pecies of cloth re&s;embling linen. This &s;pecies of
cloth is frequently mentioned by Pliny. It was principally
u&s;ed for &s;hrouds, in which the bodies of the great were en|veloped
before they were placed upon the funeral pile; and
which, not being liable to be con&s;umed by fire, pre&s;erved
the a&s;hes of the body &s;eparate from tho&s;e of the wood.
The art of weaving the a&s;be&s;tos into linen is not lo&s;t, as
&s;ome authors have a&s;&s;erted: but as it is very trouble&s;ome
and expen&s;ive, and as the cu&s;tom of burning bodies, which
gave it a value, is no longer in u&s;e, the manufacture is di&s;|continued.
Be&s;ide the rock of a&s;be&s;tos ju&s;t mentioned,
near Chiavenna, &s;everal mountains in the&s;e parts yield the
<PB N="292" REF="301">
&s;ame &s;ub&s;tance. The be&s;t &s;ort is found in the mountains
that border the valley of Malenco, of which I have &s;een
many very fine &s;pecimens.</P>
<P>UPON quitting Chiavenna, I entered the valley of St. Gia|como,
which is narrow, and watered by the torrent Lira. It
is part of the county of Chiavenna, contains about ten
pari&s;hes, is under the juri&s;diction of the commi&s;&s;ary, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;everal important privileges, that pre&s;erve the inha|bitants
from the oppre&s;&s;ion which their neighbours endure.
All cau&s;es are tried in the valley. The criminal &s;tatutes are
the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Chiavenna, with this difference only,
that in&s;tead of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or the valley chu&s;es four per&s;ons,
who are always pre&s;ent at the examination; and without
who&s;e concurrence torture cannot be inflicted, nor &s;entence
pa&s;&s;ed. The valley has its own code of civil juri&s;prudence,
and courts independent of the commi&s;&s;ary, from the deci&s;ion
of which there lies an appeal to the diet. The lower part of
the valley produces vines and corn: the upper part rye, bar|ley,
and pa&s;ture, mixed with large groves of fir and pine. I
pa&s;&s;ed on my left hand the church of St. Guglielmo, which I
mention becau&s;e it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been erected in ho|nour
of William king of Sicily. This William was the la&s;t
&s;overeign of the male branch of the Norman line, which
commenced in Count Roger, who conquered Sicily from the
Saracens in the latter end of the eleventh century.</P>
<P>ROGER was twelfth &s;on of Tancred of Hauteville, a Nor|man
baron, and brother of the celebrated Robert Gui&s;card,

the brave&s;t of tho&s;e brave Norman adventurers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I would refer the curious reader to Mr. Gibbon's ample and accurate narrative of the hi&s;tory and exploits of the&s;e Norman adventurers, in the fifth volume of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.</NOTE> who &s;allied
from their native country, formed a flouri&s;hing but tempo|rary
e&s;tabli&s;hment in the &s;outhern parts of Italy, and fur|ni&s;hed
by their exploits &s;uch ample materials for hi&s;tory and
romance. The &s;on of Count Roger, who inherited the name
and &s;pirit of his father, erected Sicily into a kingdom: at
the extinction of the male line of Robert Gui&s;card in the
per&s;on of William, duke of Apulia, he annexed Apulia and
Calabria to Sicily, and reigned over tho&s;e territories, under
the title of the Two Sicilies, which now comprehend the
pre&s;ent kingdom of Naples and Sicily. The throne of
Roger was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively filled by his &s;on William the Fir&s;t,
&s;urnamed the <HI>Bad,</HI> and by his grand&s;on William the Second,
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Good.</HI> On the demi&s;e of the
latter without i&s;&s;ue male, the Sicilians &s;et a&s;ide Con&s;tantia,
daughter of Roger, and wife of the emperor Henry the
Sixth, and elected Tancred, illegitimate grand&s;on of the fir&s;t
king. Tancred died in 1193; and William, his only &s;urviv|ing
&s;on, was crowned while an infant. Being dethroned by
the emperor Henry the Sixth, who claimed the Two Sicilies
in right of his wife Con&s;tantia, he was impri&s;oned, together
with his mother Sibilla, in the fortre&s;s of Ems, near Coire.
Some authors a&s;&s;ert that he was deprived of his &s;ight, others
that he was mutilated, by order of Henry. Some relate that he
died in pri&s;on, others that he was relea&s;ed, together with his
mother Sibilla; that he accompanied her to France, but grow|ing
weary of the world retired to this &s;pot, and pa&s;&s;ed the latter
<PB N="294" REF="304">
part of his days as an hermit, with &s;uch a reputation of
&s;anctity, that he was canoni&s;ed after his death. Such con|tradictory
accounts occur frequently in the hi&s;tory of the
dark ages. Muratori, who from his in&s;ight into the ancient
records is mo&s;t capable of &s;olving this difficulty, leaves the
que&s;tion undecided; but &s;eems rather inclined to believe,
that William was relea&s;ed from his captivity, and that he
afterwards turned hermit. As the genealogy of the Norman
line is very complicated and ob&s;cure, and erroneou&s;ly repre|&s;ented

<P>FROM I&s;ola the a&s;cent is &s;teep and rugged to the top

road is hewn in the &s;olid rock: in many parts it has the ap|pearance

frequently reminded of the pa&s;&s;age down the Gemmi<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Letter 33.</NOTE>.
Toward the &s;ummit of the Splugen there is an oval plain
about two miles long and one broad, encircled with craggy
points: it produces no trees, but yields rich pa&s;turage.
Near the &s;ummit are &s;everal rude blocks of a whiti&s;h kind

fore&s;ts. This pa&s;&s;age over mount Splugen is principally
u&s;ed for the tran&s;port of merchandi&s;e to and from Coire: it
is kept open even in winter, though not without great diffi|culty.
In that &s;ea&s;on the merchandi&s;es are chiefly tran&s;|ported
on &s;ledges, of which forty or fifty pa&s;s in a day.</P>
<P>THE territory of the Grey League occupies all the ea&s;tern
tract of this mountainous country, and is by far the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable, in extent as well as population, of the three
Gri&s;on leagues. The etymology of the word Grigia, or
<HI>Grey,</HI> which gives its name to this league and the whole
country, is extremely uncertain. Some authors have conjec|tured,
that the people of this di&s;trict were the original inha|bitants
of the country, and were called <HI>Grey,</HI> in order to di&s;|tingui&s;h
them from the more modern inhabitants, by an al|lu&s;ion
to <HI>grey</HI> hairs, an emblem of antiquity. Others, on the
contrary, dating this appellation from more modern times,
a&s;&s;ert that the fir&s;t authors of the revolution, which, in 1424,
gave liberty to the &s;everal communities in the Grey League,
were dre&s;t in the coar&s;e <HI>grey</HI> cloth of the country; and that
in commemoration of this great event the league was called
<HI>Grey</HI> from their dre&s;s. It is certain, however, that this ap|pellation
is of very high antiquity, and exi&s;ted long before
the revolution. Tacitus calls the inhabitants of this country
<HI>Rhaetos Gri&s;eos, id e&s;t, canos;</HI> and Ammianus Marcellinus
&s;tyles the country about Coire, <HI>Canos campos,</HI> or the <HI>Grey</HI>
Fields. Hence it appears how very fruitle&s;s mu&s;t be any
inve&s;tigation concerning the true etymology of a word which
<PB N="299" REF="310">
lies hid in very remote antiquity, beyond the reach of our
mo&s;t inqui&s;itive re&s;earches. Without entering, therefore,
too minutely into etymological di&s;qui&s;itions, we may only
remark in general, that the term Gri&s;ons, or <HI>Grey</HI> people,
was the general name by which <HI>all</HI> the inhabitants of Rhetia
were di&s;tingui&s;hed, and was not confined to that particular
di&s;trict now called the Grey League. The appropriation of
the term to that particular body, may be thus accounted for.
When the inhabitants of this di&s;trict fir&s;t ro&s;e in arms, for
the purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;erting their independence, they naturally
&s;tyled them&s;elves, the League of the people called Gri&s;ons,
or the <HI>Grey</HI> League; while tho&s;e of the two other leagues,
who afterwards formed &s;imilar a&s;&s;ociations, although equally
known by the name of Gri&s;ons, took different appellations
to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the fir&s;t confederacy.</P>
<P>THE territory now occupied by the Grey League, was
formerly &s;ubject to the abbot of Di&s;entis, the counts of
Werdenberg, of Sax, of Ma&s;ox, and the baron the Retzuns.
The people &s;eem to have originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable
privileges, which were gradually undermined, and occa&s;ion|ally
violated by their chiefs and barons; engaged in perpetual
ho&s;tilities with each other, the barons laid great exactions
upon their &s;ubjects, in order to pay their troops, who could
only be prevented from di&s;banding by repeated large&s;&s;es.
The&s;e exactions were at length carried to &s;uch an exce&s;s,
and the people &s;o wantonly oppre&s;&s;ed by the tyranny of
their de&s;pots, that, excited by the example of the neighbour|ing
Swi&s;s republics, they determined to deliver them&s;elves
from the grievous &s;ubjection under which they had long
<PB N="300" REF="311">
laboured. But the meeting of the in&s;urgents was by no
means attended with any unwarrantable exce&s;&s;es, naturally
to be expected from an enraged populace, but was conducted
with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure. The leading members of the
&s;everal communities having previou&s;ly concerted the plan, a
&s;olemn deputation was di&s;patched to the re&s;pective &s;ove|reigns,
who were a&s;&s;embled at Truns: the deputies laid
the grievances before the chiefs, from whom they not only
extorted redre&s;s, but procured a re&s;titution of &s;everal ob&s;o|lete
privileges, and the addition of many new immunities.
In con&s;ideration of the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, the chiefs were per|mitted
to re&s;erve to them&s;elves certain prerogatives, which
&s;ome of their de&s;cendants or &s;ucce&s;&s;ors po&s;&s;e&s;s at this day; a
di&s;tinction which is now peculiar to this league, and renders
its general con&s;titution in &s;ome re&s;pects more ari&s;tocratical
than that of the other two leagues.</P>
<P>THESE prerogatives con&s;i&s;t in being pre&s;ent at the annual
diet of the league, and in alternately propo&s;ing three candidates
for <HI>Landrichter,</HI> or chief of the league, from whom one is no|minated
by the deputies. The counts of Werdenberg being
extinct, the&s;e prerogatives are now confined to the emperor
of Germany, as baron of Rhetzuns, the abbot of Di&s;entis,
and the temporary count of Sax. No real count of Sax now
exi&s;ts; for, upon the extinction of that family, certain com|munities
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e communities are Lungnets and Vals, Ilants and Grub, Flims and Ca&s;tris.</NOTE> of the Grey League &s;eized the domains, and
continue to exerci&s;e the rights which were formerly enjoyed
by the counts of Sax. The mode of creating a titular
<PB N="301" REF="312">
count for the purpo&s;e of exerci&s;ing the&s;e rights, is as follows:
A few days before the meeting of the diet of the league
a&s;&s;embled at Truns, tho&s;e communities elect a per&s;on who
repre&s;ents the count. He is called in Roman&s;h<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Literally <HI>head</HI> of Sax. <HI>Cau</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a corruption from <HI>caput.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cau de Saxe</HI>
and, although not unfrequently a common pea&s;ant, &s;its, at
the diet, upon the &s;ame bench with the repre&s;entative of the
Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and the abbot of Di&s;entis, is addre&s;&s;ed by a
title equal to his &s;uppo&s;ed dignity, nominates the Land|richter
every third year, and, having di&s;charged his office,
&s;inks at the expiration of a few days into his ordinary rank.</P>
<P>ANOTHER di&s;tinction peculiar to the Grey League ought
not to be omitted. Like the other leagues, the particular
di&s;tricts po&s;&s;e&s;s their courts of criminal ju&s;tice in the la&s;t re|&s;ort;
but in all civil cau&s;es above a certain value an appeal
lies from the deci&s;ion of the &s;everal courts to &s;ixteen depu|ties
annually a&s;&s;embled at Truns. I only mention the fact
in this place, but &s;hall have occa&s;ion to enlarge upon it in a
future letter.</P>
<P>SPLUGEN, &s;ituated upon the ri&s;e of an hill, at the bottom
of a rugged chain of alps, is the principal place in the val|ley
of Rheinwald which forms a high juri&s;diction of the
Grey League. The Rheinwald is &s;o called from the Hynder
Rhine, which takes its ri&s;e upon the Vogel&s;berg, about the
di&s;tance of twelve miles, and runs through this valley. It
was my intention to have vi&s;ited this &s;ource, but my late in|di&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="302" REF="313">
will not permit me at pre&s;ent to take fatiguing
journeys.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the Rheinwald &s;peak German, although
they are entirely &s;urrounded by people who u&s;e a different
language. Towards the &s;outh, beyond the mountains of
Splugen and St. Bernardin, in the valleys of St. Giacomo and
Ma&s;ox, Italian is the common tongue: towards the north and
ea&s;t, in the valleys of Schams, of St. Peter, and of Lugnetz,
Roman&s;h is &s;poken. This remarkable circum&s;tance has
led many authors to conjecture that the people of this and
other di&s;tricts of the Gri&s;ons, who talk German, are de|&s;cended
from the <HI>Lepontii,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Celtic nation,
and con&s;idered as the original inhabitants of this country,
before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Rhetians. As I &s;hall have
occa&s;ion to examine this &s;ubject more fully in a future
letter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 90.</NOTE> upon the languages of the Gri&s;ons, I &s;hall for the
pre&s;ent only remark, that although the inhabitants of this
di&s;trict are immediately encircled by people who talk Italian
and Roman&s;h, yet the German language is &s;poken at Avers,
Cepina, Tu&s;is, and Fur&s;tenau, which are only at a &s;mall
di&s;tance from the Rheinwald. I quitted, on the other &s;ide
of mount Splugen, the Italian climate and productions: the
air of this valley is &s;o piercing, that we may agree with the
proverb, &startq;There are nine months winter and three months
cold.&endq; Two high roads meet at Splugen, one from Chia|venna,
the other leads over the Bernard into Bellinzone.
<PB N="303" REF="314">
From Splugen to Arder the road continues by the &s;ide of the
Hynder Rhine, through a mountainous region, which pre|&s;ents
at every &s;tep the mo&s;t awful magnificence of &s;cenery.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of Suffers, the la&s;t village of the Rhein|wald,
talk German; and at a &s;mall di&s;tance is the valley of
Schams, where the pea&s;ants &s;peak Roman&s;h. I made my|&s;elf
tolerably under&s;tood by a kind of jargon, compo&s;ed of
German, Italian, and Roman&s;h; and taking out my voca|bulary
of the Engadina language, compared the different
modes of expre&s;&s;ion and pronunciation. The inhabitants
call their language Roman&s;h; but it differs widely from the
Roman&s;h &s;poken in the valley of Sur&s;et, and &s;till more
from that of the Engadinas. The Bible, and other books
u&s;ed in this valley, are in the &s;ame dialect as tho&s;e which
are read in the other parts of the Grey League, and the
language is &s;imilar, with a &s;mall variety in the pronun|ciation.</P>
<P>THE valley of Schams, a community of the Grey League,
contains eight or nine incon&s;iderable burghs or villages &s;itu|ated
at &s;mall di&s;tances upon each &s;ide of the Rhine. It is
much $ower and more fruitful than the Rheinwald. I
cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Zillis, leaving on my left hand Donat,
where the collective body of people meet every year to chu&s;e
their magi&s;trates, and regulate all civil and political affairs,
and &s;oon afterwards came into the <HI>Via Mala,</HI> &s;o called from
the &s;uppo&s;ed difficulties and dangers of pa&s;&s;ing through it.
Such dreadful de&s;criptions have been given by different tra|vellers,
that I expected to have found it the wor&s;t road
<PB N="304" REF="315">
which I had hitherto travelled. But I was agreeably de|ceived,
for it was not more incommodious than the way
from Splugen to Anders; nor was it once nece&s;&s;ary even to
di&s;mount from my hor&s;e, except when I &s;topped to take a
nearer view of any particular &s;cene which &s;truck my fancy:
the road even admits carriages. No rea&s;on occurs to me,
why this particular way &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the ap|pellation
of <HI>Via Mala,</HI> unle&s;s &s;uch de&s;criptions allude to
former times, and modern writers have adopted them as the
mere echos of ancient travellers. Perhaps the peculiar gloom
of the valley, through which the road pa&s;&s;es, may have
helped to convey the&s;e ideas of terror to per&s;ons not ac|cu&s;tomed
to Alpine regions.</P>
<P>THE Via Mala runs through a dark and uninhabited
valley, over&s;pread in many parts with thick fore&s;ts, which
admit only a kind of twilight gloom, and &s;o exceedingly
narrow, that the &s;teep rocks, which enclo&s;e it, hang over,
and &s;eem almo&s;t to meet towards their &s;ummits. The Rhine
foams at the bottom, &s;ometimes not vi&s;ible, and &s;ometimes
faintly glimmering through
<Q><L>&startq;&mdash;dark&s;ome pines, that, o'er the rocks reclin'd,</L>
<L>Wave high, and murmur to the hollow wind.&endq; POPE.</L></Q></P>
<P>ABOUT three miles from the commencement of the Via
Mala we came to a &s;tone bridge of a &s;ingle arch, thrown
acro&s;s a gulf; a &s;ublime &s;cene, which I &s;topped to admire,
and left with regret. The Rhine falls in a beautiful ca&s;cade,
rolls in a narrow channel at the depth of above four hundred
<PB REF="316">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="305" REF="317">
feet perpendicular, furiou&s;ly da&s;hes under the bridge, ex|pands
it&s;elf into a wide ba&s;on, and then is lo&s;t under a rock,
through which it has forced a pa&s;&s;age. The impending
mountains, partly bare, and partly embrowned with $irs,
ca&s;t an awful gloom over the gulf beneath. One circum|&s;tance,
which I examined with much attention, and which I
had ob&s;erved in &s;everal other valleys of Switzerland, but
never in &s;uch perfection as in this place, particularly &s;truck
me. The Rhine, which is at pre&s;ent about four hundred
feet below the bridge, &s;eems evidently to have once flowed
as high, or even higher than the place where the bridge
now &s;tands; to have gradually worn away the rock, and ex|cavated
the deep channel in which it now runs.</P>
<P>HAVING pa&s;&s;ed the bridge, I went through a &s;ubterra|neous
opening a few paces in length, which had been cut
through the overhanging rock, cro&s;&s;ed a &s;econd bridge &s;imi|lar
to the fir&s;t, and &s;oon afterwards quitted the Rhine, and
began a&s;cending. This part of the country is &s;o entirely
uninhabited, that I did not meet with a &s;ingle hou&s;e until I
came to Roncalia, a village in the community of Tu&s;is, upon
the top of a &s;teep mountain. From thence I de&s;cended to
Tu&s;is, &s;ituated near the torrent Nolla, at the beginning
of the valley of Tomlia&s;ca. This town is &s;aid by the anti|quaries
to have been built by the Tu&s;cans, when they took
refuge in the&s;e parts under Rhaetus.</P>
<P>TUSIS is well known in the hi&s;tory of the Gri&s;ons for the
<HI>Staffgericht,</HI> or court of ju&s;tice, which &s;at in 1618, for the
trial of per&s;ons accu&s;ed of holding a corre&s;pondence with
<PB N="306" REF="318">
Spain, and of oppo&s;ing the introduction of the Prote&s;tant re|ligion
into the Valteline. Among&s;t tho&s;e who &s;uffered in
this iniquitous tribunal, the mo&s;t remarkable was Nicholas
Ru&s;ca, whom I had occa&s;ion to mention in my letter on the
troubles of the Valteline, the cruel circum&s;tances of who&s;e
death excited the general re&s;entment of the Catholics, who
&s;oon afterwards broke out into open rebellion. Nicholas
Ru&s;ca, a native of Bedano, in the bailliage of Locarno, was
educated in the Je&s;uits' college at Milan, at the expence of
cardinal Boromeo, and made &s;o great a progre&s;s in his
&s;tudies, that, in 1589, he was appointed principal of the
church of Sondrio, although he was only in the 24th year of
his age. He immediately &s;ignali&s;ed him&s;elf by his zeal in
preaching again&s;t the reformed doctrines; and was one of
the di&s;putants who &s;upported the Roman Catholic faith
again&s;t the Prote&s;tant mini&s;ters, in two public conferences
held at Tirano in 1595, and the following year. His charac|ter
has been placed in the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite lights by the re|&s;pective
hi&s;torians of the two contending parties: by the
one he is repre&s;ented a &s;aint, and by the other an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.
But if we examine with impartiality, it will appear, that
though he was hurried on by a violent &s;pirit of fanatical
zeal, yet he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed guilty of the atrocious crimes
which his enemies have laid to his charge. Soon after
his promotion to the benefice of Sondrio, a mi&s;under&s;tand|ing
broke out between him and the Prote&s;tants, which gra|dually
increa&s;ed during the violence of the religious di&s;putes,
and was carried upon the following occa&s;ion to the highe&s;t
degree of animo&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="319">
CHIAPPINUS, and three gondoliers of Venice, were ar|re&s;ted
under &s;u&s;picion of a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Scipio
Calandrinus, the Prote&s;tant mini&s;ter of Sondrio, at the in&s;ti|gation
of Ru&s;ca; a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt and of Ru&s;ca's privity
being drawn from Chiappinus by the force of torture. The
governor of the Valteline referring the affair to the diet of
the Gri&s;ons, Ru&s;ca was cited before that a&s;&s;embly, but de|clined
to appear; either, as his enemies pretend, from a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, or, as his friends alledge, from a dread
of putting him&s;elf in the power of the Gri&s;ons, &s;o violently
incen&s;ed again&s;t him. Having e&s;caped from the Valteline,
he waited at Bedano while his cau&s;e was publicly pleaded
before twelve judges deputed by the Gri&s;ons. Being acquit|ted
of the charge, he returned to Sondrio, where his zeal,
inflamed by his late pro&s;ecution, continued to di&s;play it&s;elf
by an unremitting oppo&s;ition to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Pro|te&s;tant
&s;chool at Sondrio; a favourite mea&s;ure of the op|po&s;ite
party.</P>
<P>HIS enemies, baffled in their fir&s;t attempt, brought
again&s;t him a charge of a more public nature: they accu&s;ed
him of counteracting the decrees of the Gri&s;ons, and of ex|horting
the inhabitants of Morbegno not to bear arms
again&s;t the king of Spain, the protector of the Catholic re|ligion.
In con&s;equence of the&s;e in&s;inuations, a troop of
&s;ixty Gri&s;ons arrived at Sondrio by night, and, &s;eizing Ru&s;ca,
carried him to Tu&s;is, where he was not only impeached of
high trea&s;on in the temporary court of ju&s;tice there a&s;&s;em|bled,
but was likewi&s;e again examined, contrary to every
principle of equity, for having abetted the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of
<PB N="308" REF="320">
Calandrinus: as he preremptorily denied the&s;e charges, he
was condemned to be tortured; which horrid &s;entence was
three times inflicted in the dead of night. The execution
of the &s;entence failing to extort from him the &s;malle&s;t con|fe&s;&s;ion
of guilt, he was, on the following night, twice &s;ub|jected
to the &s;ame dreadful proce&s;s. Being of a weak frame,
and full of infirmities, he was overcome by exce&s;s of agony,
and expired amid&s;t the torments<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Die dominica, quae Augu&s;ti 23 erat, ter &s;ine tamen pondere elevatus fuit; per&s;$ititque in negativa, &s;aepius mi&s;ericordiam Dei ac homi|num implorans, quas voces dolor tormentorum ip&s;e exprimebat, erat enim homo crebris febri|bus vexatus, ac proinde &s;u&s;tinendi torturam impos erat.

<P>SOME writers have a&s;&s;erted, that Ru&s;ca died of poi&s;on,
which he had taken previous to his la&s;t examination; but
this &s;uppo&s;ition &s;eems to be totally void of foundation, and
was only advanced in order to re&s;cue the judges from the
odium of having tortured him to death. For when it is
con&s;idered, that, according to the common mode of applying
torture in this country, he was five times drawn up by a pulley,
with his arms tied behind, &s;o as to occa&s;ion a di&s;location of
his &s;houlders; that he remained in that excruciating po&s;ition
above half an hour each time; and that he was in an infirm
&s;tate of body, unable to endure &s;uch extremity of pain, we
have no occa&s;ion to &s;eek for any extraordinary cau&s;e of his
death. The advocates for the Prote&s;tant party in vain en|deavour

<P>FROM Tu&s;is I continued my route along the valley of
Tomlia&s;ca, by the &s;ide of the Rhine, which here &s;e|parates
the Grey League from that of the Hou&s;e of God:
numerous towns, villages, and ca&s;tles<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Guler, the hi&s;torian of Rhetia, &s;ays, that no region of Europe contains &s;uch a number of ancient ca&s;tles as the coun|try of the Gri&s;ons; and adds, that in the &s;mall valley of Tomlia&s;ca, not more than a German mile long, and a quarter broad, there are more than &s;eventeen ca&s;tles.</NOTE>, lie agreeably &s;cattered
through the vale in the mo&s;t romantic &s;ituations. I pa&s;&s;ed
through Catzis, leaving on my left the fruitful mountain
of Henzenberg, called in Roman&s;h Montagnia, and re|markable
for its fertility and population; proceeded to
Retzuns, and turned a little out of my way to the ca&s;tle of
that name, which makes &s;o con&s;picuous a figure in the
hi&s;tory of the Gri&s;ons. Antiquarians derive the name of
Retzuns from <HI>Rhaetium</HI> or <HI>Rhaetia Ima</HI> (Lower Rhaetia), and
give the following account of its con&s;truction. In the
early ages of the Roman hi&s;tory a numerous army of Gauls
penetrated into Lombardy, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t
part of that country, which was then occupied by the
Tu&s;cans. A con&s;iderable body of Tu&s;cans being driven from
their native country accompanied their leader, Rhaetus, and
e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the&s;e regions. Rhaetus gave his

<PB N="311" REF="324">
own name to the whole region, and con&s;tructed that fortre&s;s
which he called Rhaetia Ima, &s;ince corrupted into Retzuns.
Livy relates the emigration of the Tu&s;cans into the&s;e parts
without mentioning the name of their leader, who is called
Rhaetus by Pliny and Ju&s;tin; and the number of places &s;till

<P>BUT as events of &s;uch high antiquity will always be liable
to much doubt, let us de&s;cend to later times, which admit
of no di&s;pute. The ca&s;tle was the re&s;idence of a baron,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the adjacent territory, and was called Baron of
Retzuns. His name frequently occurs in the ancient hi&s;tory
of this country, when the territory of the Gri&s;ons was divided
into &s;everal petty &s;overeignties. He is al&s;o mentioned among
the chiefs, who a&s;&s;embled in 1424 at Truns, and confirmed
and enlarged the privileges of the people, when the &s;everal
communities united and formed the Grey League. At that
time the baron re&s;erved to him&s;elf certain prerogatives,
which are now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. In 1459, the
male line being extinct, the barony de&s;cended to a collateral
branch, and in 1470 came by purcha&s;e into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the emperor Maximilian the Fir&s;t. Ferdinand the Fir&s;t
mortgaged the barony for 14, 000 florins to John Planta, in
who&s;e family it continued until the year 1679, when it was
redeemed by the emperor Leopold, and it now belongs to
his grand-daughter Maria Tere&s;a, the pre&s;ent empre&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The empre&s;s was alive when this letter was written: on her decea&s;e it de&s;cended to Jo&s;eph II. and &s;ince his death to Leopold II. and Francis II.</NOTE>.
<PB N="312" REF="325">
The revenues of this territory are very &s;mall, amounting
to 2, 000 florins, or &s;carcely &pound;. 200 <HI>per ann.;</HI> but by the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of it the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria enjoys con&s;iderable in|fluence
in the political affairs of the Gri&s;ons. The delegate
of the empre&s;s, who is called Admini&s;trator, has a vote in
the diet of Truns, and nominates every third year the <HI>Land|richter,</HI>
or Chief of the Grey League.</P>
<P>BEING de&s;irous of &s;eeing the ca&s;tle, I &s;ent my compli|ments
to the Au&s;trian delegate, who in&s;tantly made his ap|pearance,
and politely attended me round the ca&s;tle. The
pre&s;ent building was rai&s;ed by Leopold, upon the foundation
of the ancient &s;tructure, of which there are &s;carcely any
remains. I could not, upon the clo&s;e&s;t in&s;pection, di&s;cern
the &s;lighte&s;t traces of Roman workman&s;hip. This ca&s;tle is
the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the Au&s;trian Envoy to the Republic of
the Gri&s;ons; but as the pre&s;ent envoy dwells in his own
hou&s;e at Reichenau, it is now occupied by the Au&s;trian de|legate.
It is &s;ituated upon an eminence, and commands a
fine view of the adjacent country. The rich plain, which
extends as far as Reichenau, is bounded on all &s;ides by high
mountains, and yields, among other productions, abun|dance
of wheat. The Lower Rhine flows through it in a
wide and &s;tony channel.</P>
<P>THE delegate finding, during our conver&s;ation, that I had
a letter of recommendation from Count Firmian to the
Au&s;trian Envoy at Reichenau, invited me to dinner, and
politely offered to accompany me in the afternoon to Reiche|nau;
an invitation which I made no &s;cruple to accept. The
<PB N="313" REF="326">
company at table con&s;i&s;ted of the admini&s;trator, his wife,
and a capuchin friar. The lady &s;poke nothing but Roman&s;h;
I was not able to enjoy much of her conver&s;ation; could only
drink her health, and make her a &s;hort compliment, which
I had learned by rote. But I held a long conver&s;ation, in the
French tongue, with the admini&s;trator, upon the barony of
Retzuns, on which &s;ubject he kindly gave me the following
information. As delegate of the empre&s;s of Germany, he
has a kind of territorial juri&s;diction over the village and
di&s;trict of Retzuns. The barony of Retzuns compri&s;es the
villages of Retzuns, Bonadutz, Embs, and Feld&s;berg, which
form a High Juri&s;diction in the Grey League, and &s;end two
deputies to the general diet of the Gri&s;ons; the people are
free; they a&s;&s;emble annually in the court of the ca&s;tle to
elect their magi&s;trates, when every male at the age of four|teen
has a vote. The delegate nominates the Landamman
from three candidates appointed by the people: the empre&s;s
receives the fines for criminal offences, and pays the expences
of the proce&s;s; the pri&s;oners are confined in the ca&s;tle, but
are tried by judges cho&s;en by the people.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner I accompanied my ho&s;t through a rich and
fertile plain to Reichenau, and waited upon Mr. Buol, the
Au&s;trian envoy, who received me with great attention and
politene&s;s; and obligingly invited me to remain &s;ome time
at Reichenau: an invitation I declined for the pre&s;ent, through
my impatience of arriving at Coire, where I expected to
receive &s;everal letters from my friends in England, from
whom I had not heard &s;ince my departure from Milan. Reiche|nau
is &s;ituated upon the conflux of the two branches which
<PB N="314" REF="327">
form the Rhine. The lower branch is the &s;ame which I fol|lowed
during the greate&s;t part of its cour&s;e from Splugen;
the upper branch ri&s;es near the mountain of St. Gothard,
and flows through the valley of Sopra Selva. The ca&s;tle, or
hou&s;e of Mr. Buol, is placed in a mo&s;t romantic &s;ituation
upon a &s;mall eminence, a little above the junction, and the
garden advances to the Rhine. At this place there are two
bridges, which were built by the nephew of Grubenman,
that de&s;erve particular notice; one, which is thrown acro&s;s
the lower branch of the Rhine, mea&s;ured thirty-five paces,
or about a hundred and five feet. The &s;econd is built acro&s;s
the Rhine below the point of union, and forms a mo&s;t beau|tiful
object. It is a wooden bridge of a &s;ingle arch, covered
like that of Schaffhau&s;en, and con&s;tructed upon the &s;ame
plan, with this difference however, that the road is not
carried in &s;o perfect a level. The &s;pan of the arch is two
hundred and twenty feet in length. As the banks of the
Rhine in this &s;pot are more elevated than tho&s;e of the &s;ame
river at Schaffhau&s;en, the bridge of Reichenau is rai&s;ed con|&s;iderably
higher above the &s;urface of the water than that of
Schaffhau&s;en<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Letter 2. p. 6.</NOTE>. And as it pre&s;ents al&s;o to the eye but a
&s;ingle curve, its general appearance is far more picture&s;que,
and its effect more &s;triking. But it is not near &s;o beautiful
a piece of architecture as the bridge of Wettingen, which
is Grubenman's ma&s;ter-piece<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 13.</NOTE>. The more I examine the&s;e
bridges, the more I am &s;truck with the &s;ublime &s;implicity
of the &s;tructure; the more I am a&s;toni&s;hed, that the per&s;on
who fir&s;t conceived the plan was a common carpenter, totally
<PB REF="328">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="315" REF="329">
unacquainted with the theory of mechanics, and indebted
to a natural genius for having carried practical architecture
to &s;uch perfection. In my way from Reichenau to Coire I
&s;topped at Embs, in order to inquire if there are any remains
of an old ca&s;tle, in which William, &s;on of Tancred king of
Sicily, was confined. At pre&s;ent there is not the &s;malle&s;t
ve&s;tige of &s;uch a fabric; but according to the tradition of
the country it formerly &s;tood upon a hill, whereon the
church is now erected.</P>
<P>THE valley from Reichenau to Coire is about two miles
broad, and produces corn, pa&s;ture, and &s;ome vines, which
begin to make their appearance near Embs. The Rhine
flows through it with the rapidity of a torrent. Several in|&s;ulated
rocks are &s;cattered on the banks of the river, &s;ome
barren, others covered with wood, which greatly diver&s;ify
the &s;cenery. The chain of mountains fronting the northern
a&s;pect is over&s;pread with groves of fir, while the oppo&s;ite
ridge is richly clothed for &s;ome way with oaks, and its &s;um|mits
crowned with firs and pines. A little way beyond I
entered the League of the Hou&s;e of God, and arrived in
good time at Coire.</P>

<P>THE whole territory, which is now compri&s;ed within
the League of the Hou&s;e of God, was under the
dominion of the bi&s;hop of Coire, until the people, oppre&s;&s;ed
by their rulers, threw off the yoke, and having formed a
general league, compelled the bi&s;hop to ratify their inde|pendence.
The aera of this important revolution is not
preci&s;ely marked in the annals of this country. Some hi&s;to|rians
have even a&s;&s;erted, that it happened &s;o early as the
latter end of the fourteenth century, and was anterior to the
formation of the Grey League. But this opinion does not
&s;eem to be grounded upon &s;ufficient evidence; as the facts
alledged in its &s;upport intimate little more than that the
bi&s;hop granted &s;everal immunities to the inhabitants, but
by no means prove, that the communities formed them|&s;elves
into a league at &s;uch an early period, and afforded the

For that honour is
undoubtedly due to the Grey League. This revolution,
which finally exalted the league into its pre&s;ent &s;tate of
freedom, probably took place between 1424, the aera of the
<PB N="317" REF="331">
formation of the Grey League, and 1436, the year in which
the Ten Juri&s;dictions ro&s;e into independence.</P>
<P>This league is denominated in Roman&s;h <HI>La Ligia de la
Chiada</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chiada,</HI> or as it is &s;ometimes written, <HI>Ca-de,</HI> &s;ignifies cathedral. Hence the French call it <HI>La Ligue Cadd$.</HI></NOTE>; in German, <HI>Gott&s;hau&s;bund,</HI> from which we call it
the <HI>League of the Hou&s;e of God:</HI> it takes this appellation as
well from the cathedral &s;ituated in its capital, as from having
once been under the juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hop of Coire. It
is divided into eleven di&s;tricts; each of which (Coire except|ed)
is &s;ubdivided into two little republics, or communities.
By this arrangement the league comprehends twenty-one
republics<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Introduction.</NOTE>, and &s;ends twenty-two deputies to the general
diet.</P>
<P>FORMERLY the burgoma&s;ter of Coire was perpetual chief
of the league without election, but in the latter end of the
la&s;t century the other communities claimed a power of no|minating
to this office in their turn. The affair being refer|red
to the arbitration of Zuric, it was decided, that for the
future the twenty-two deputies of this league &s;hould choo&s;e
two candidates from the members of the &s;enate of Coire;
and that the&s;e two candidates &s;hould draw lots for the
charge: a mode of election which is now in u&s;e. The chief
thus appointed is called <HI>Bunds-pre&s;ident,</HI> and has &s;everal
privileges which di&s;tingui&s;h him from the chiefs of the two
other leagues. He receives all the letters addre&s;&s;ed to the
Republic of the Gri&s;ons from foreign powers, and is al&s;o
<PB N="318" REF="332">
perpetual pre&s;ident of the Congre&s;s, becau&s;e that a&s;&s;embly is
always held at Coire.</P>
<P>COIRE is &s;ituated at the foot of the Alps, in a rich plain
between two or three miles wide; a con&s;iderable breadth of
valley for this mountainous country. Oppo&s;ite is the chain
of mountains which &s;eparate the country of the Gri&s;ons
from the canton of Glarus: of this chain the Calendar is
e&s;teemed the highe&s;t point; but it is far inferior in elevation
to &s;everal of the Swi&s;s and Savoy Alps I vi&s;ited in my la&s;t
tour, and wants one certain criterion of great height, perpe|tual
&s;now. The town lies partly in the plain, and partly
upon the &s;teep &s;ide of a rock, and is &s;urrounded with ancient
brick walls, with &s;quare and round towers, in the &s;tyle of
fortification prior to the invention of powder. The &s;treets
are narrow and dirty. Several towns of Upper Engadina,
although not &s;o large, make a neater and more elegant ap|pearance.
It contains about three thou&s;and &s;ouls.</P>
<P>MANY fables are related concerning the foundation of
Coire: the mo&s;t probable account &s;eems to be, that it owes
its origin to the emperor Con&s;tantius, who, in the 355th
year of the Chri&s;tian aera, penetrated into Rhetia, and fixed
his &s;tation for &s;ome time near the &s;pot where Coire now
&s;tands. A town, as it often happened on &s;uch occa&s;ions,
was perhaps con&s;tructed near the camp; and from the im|perial
re&s;idence it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have derived the name
<HI>Curia,</HI> its ancient appellation, &s;ince corrupted into <HI>Coira</HI>
and <HI>Coire.</HI> The remains of two or three towers, which are
evidently of Roman con&s;truction, atte&s;t its antiquity, and
<PB N="319" REF="333">
&s;erve to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of the&s;e conjectures concerning
its origin. The town of Coire was formerly a city of
the German empire, under the dominion of its own counts,
and came in the ninth century under the juri&s;diction of the
bi&s;hop. Like many other cities of Germany, it obtained
con&s;iderable privileges from the different emperors; and
the inhabitants, having gradually circum&s;cribed the autho|rity
of the bi&s;hop, at length e&s;tabli&s;hed an independent
republic.</P>
<P>THE government of Coire is of a mixed form, partly
ari&s;tocratical, partly democratical. The &s;upreme legi&s;lative
authority re&s;ides in the citizens, who&s;e number amounts to
two hundred and ninety-four, divided into five tribes.
Each citizen has a voice at the age of twenty. The &s;uffrages
are never collected in a meeting of the whole body of the
people a&s;&s;embled together in one &s;pot; but the object of de|liberation
is &s;eparately laid before each tribe, and is decided
by the majority of the five tribes. The executive power is
entru&s;ted to the council of &s;eventy, compo&s;ed of fourteen
members annually elected from each tribe. This &s;overeign
council is divided into &s;everal le&s;&s;er departments, of which
the principal is the &s;enate, or council of fifteen, who have
the chief direction of affairs, either &s;olely or conjointly with
other members of the &s;overeign council. The chiefs of
Coire are two burgoma&s;ters taken from the members of the
&s;enate, who, although liable to be removed, invariably con|tinue
in office for life. The&s;e two magi&s;trates enjoy the
&s;upreme dignity by rotation, each for the &s;pace of a year;
during which term the acting chief, under the title of
<PB N="320" REF="334">
reigning burgoma&s;ter, pre&s;ides in the u&s;ual councils. The
criminal tribunal is compo&s;ed of the &s;enate and fifteen other
members of the &s;overeign council. The pri&s;oners are ex|amined
and the proce&s;s made out by the &s;ecret council,
formed of the &s;even olde&s;t members of the &s;enate. The
majority of the&s;e &s;even mu&s;t concur, to order the infliction
of torture. After examination and conviction, the acts of
the proce&s;s are laid before the criminal tribunal, which ul|timately
pa&s;&s;es &s;entence; and all offences, excepting great
crimes, are commonly puni&s;hed by fines.</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity led me this morning to the apartment in
which the general diet of the Gri&s;ons is held every three
years; although it contained no object worthy of de&s;cription,
yet it did not fail to &s;trike my attention, as being the place
where the parliament of a free nation is a&s;&s;embled. Coire
&s;ends two deputies to this diet, who are generally the two
burgoma&s;ters; but if one of the&s;e &s;hould be chief of the
league, the other deputy is cho&s;en by rotation in the five
tribes, with this condition, that he mu&s;t be a member of the
council of &s;eventy.</P>
<P>FROM the apartment in which the diet is held I went to
the town-hall, in order to &s;ee the form of admini&s;tering the
oath to the new <HI>Bunds-pre&s;ident.</HI> In general the ceremony
takes place ju&s;t before the meeting of the diet, in the pre|&s;ence
of the deputies of the League of God's Hou&s;e; but as
the per&s;on to whom the office now devolves was not pre&s;ent
at the diet, it was nece&s;&s;arily po&s;tponed. All the parties
being a&s;&s;embled, Mr. T&s;charner, the la&s;t pre&s;ident, with the
<PB N="321" REF="335">
public notary, &s;tood at the upper end of the room; the gen|tleman
appointed to &s;ucceed him &s;tood at the lower end, with
the <HI>Bunds-weiber,</HI> or &s;ecretary, dre&s;&s;ed in a cloak half black
and half white, the livery of the League. Mr. T&s;charner ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or a &s;peech of about ten minutes, in
German, acquainting him, that he was appointed by the de|puties
of the League Bunds-pre&s;ident for the en&s;uing year,
giving him joy of his promotion, and congratulating the
League upon the nomination of a per&s;on &s;o well calculated
by his integrity and abilities to fulfil the duties of the office.
At the conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech, the public notary read the
oaths for the pre&s;ident, for him&s;elf, and the &s;ecretary. Mr.
T&s;charner then told them to hold up three fingers of their
right-hand, and to repeat after him their &s;everal oaths;
which ceremony being concluded, the new pre&s;ident made a
&s;hort &s;peech, that he was highly flattered with the honour
conferred upon him, and that he would &s;trive, as far as his
abilities would permit him, to promote the welfare of the
League of which he had been elected pre&s;ident. Then the
former pre&s;ident bowing to the new chief, the latter walked
fir&s;t out of the room; and thus ended the ceremony.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that although in the nomination of the
magi&s;trates, pre&s;ident, and deputies, the ari&s;tocratical party
has the entire direction, yet that the appointment to the vacant
governments of the &s;ubject provinces &s;hould be left wholly
to chance. When the turn belongs to Coire, the five tribes
meet &s;eparately, and a candidate is appointed by lot from
each tribe. The&s;e five per&s;ons then draw lots for the office,
and the &s;ucce&s;sful candidate may &s;ell the turn; with this re|&s;triction,
<PB N="322" REF="336">
that the preference of purcha&s;ing it &s;hall be given
fir&s;t to a member of the &s;ame tribe, &s;econdly to any citizen
of Coire, thirdly to an inhabitant of the League of God's
Hou&s;e. It frequently happens, that the five per&s;ons, who
are to draw lots for the government, agree to divide the
profits of the &s;ale.</P>
<P>UPON the highe&s;t part of the town &s;tands the bi&s;hop's pa|lace,
the cathedral, and the hou&s;es belonging to the chapter.
The bi&s;hopric of Coire is very antient, and was probably
erected &s;oon after the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity in
the&s;e parts under Con&s;tantine, or his &s;on. This dioce&s;e once
extended over the whole Roman province of Rhetia, which
comprehended the pre&s;ent country of the Gri&s;ons, Valteline,
Chiavenna, and Bormio, the ea&s;tern di&s;trict of Switzerland as
far as the lake of Con&s;tance, and part of Tyrol. The bi&s;hop's
territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were al&s;o con&s;iderable, and his revenues
by no means inadequate to his power and dignity. It would
be unintere&s;ting to trace the diminution of his authority,
and the gradual annihilation of his juri&s;diction over the
town of Coire, and the commonwealths of this League. I
&s;hall therefore ob&s;erve, that his authority was principally
le&s;&s;ened by the formation of the League of God's Hou&s;e,
and the limitation of his prerogatives in 1527: by the
former he was compelled to ratify the independence of the
communities; by the latter the principal prerogatives, from
which he derived great influence in the political affairs of
the Gri&s;ons, were at once annihilated; and he was reduced
to the condition of a private per&s;on, in that country wherein
he had formerly been con&s;idered as a &s;overeign prince.
<PB N="323" REF="337">
The&s;e privileges con&s;i&s;ted in having admi&s;&s;ion, and a voice
in the general diet of the Gri&s;ons; in appointing &s;everal de|puties
for the &s;ame a&s;&s;embly; in nominating the chief ma|gi&s;trates
of &s;everal communities; and in receiving appeals in
civil cau&s;es from the deci&s;ion of the provincial courts of ju&s;|tice.
All the&s;e prerogatives were abrogated by a general
diet of the Gri&s;ons in 1527; and the few remaining rights
have been either purcha&s;ed or taken away. The introduc|tion
of the Prote&s;tant religion gave the final blow to his
power; for his revenue &s;uffered great diminution by the lo&s;s
of the tythes, which were &s;eized by the reformed com|munities.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hop is prince of the Roman empire; a dignity
annexed to the &s;ee in 1170, by the emperor Frederic the
Fir&s;t, and is &s;tyled Lord of Fur&s;tenberg and Fur&s;tenau. His
annual revenues, which amount to about &pound;. 2, 000, ari&s;e
chiefly from e&s;tates near Coire, and in the Tyrol. He re|ceives
al&s;o the annual &s;um of about &pound;. 70 from the cu&s;toms
of Chiavenna, in return for having ceded his right over the
Valteline, Chiavenna, and Bormio, to the Republic of the
three leagues<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See page 242.</NOTE>. The only prerogatives remaining are the
right of coining money, and an ab&s;olute juri&s;diction both in
civil and criminal affairs within the &s;mall di&s;trict in which
his palace and the chapter are &s;ituated. Beyond this di&s;trict
he enjoys not the lea&s;t power: &s;o far from interfering in the
affairs of the town, he could not even enter it if the inhabi|tants
cho&s;e to exclude him; a right which they a&s;&s;erted in
<PB N="324" REF="338">
1764, upon the following occa&s;ion. A Catholic, in order to
avoid being arre&s;ted for a crime of which he had been guilty,
took refuge from the hands of ju&s;tice in the cathedral. The
inhabitants, inflamed by the bi&s;hop's refu&s;al to deliver him
up, rai&s;ed a gate clo&s;e to the only opening which leads into
the epi&s;copal di&s;trict; by which means the avenue to the
palace was clo&s;ed: this manoeuvre conquered the bi&s;hop's
ob&s;tinacy, and the criminal was delivered up. The gate &s;till
exi&s;ts, and is ready to be u&s;ed upon another occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hop is cho&s;en by the chapter. Many di&s;putes re|lating
to his election have ari&s;en between the canons and
the League of God's Hou&s;e: the latter, in virtue of a treaty
contracted in 1541 with the bi&s;hop, prote&s;ts, that only a na|tive
of the League can be promoted to the &s;ee. This treaty
was ob&s;erved until 1692, when a foreigner was elected; from
that period the canons have di&s;regarded the right a&s;&s;erted by
the League, and have without re&s;erve given their votes to
aliens: at every new election the League remon&s;trates, but
without effect. The pre&s;ent bi&s;hop is Francis Diony&s;ius, of
the ancient family of Ro&s;t in the Tyrol.</P>
<P>THIS epi&s;copal di&s;trict is only a few hundred paces in cir|cumference,
and is &s;urrounded by high walls. The only
object of curio&s;ity is a &s;quare tower, which forms part of the
bi&s;hop's palace, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been con&s;tructed by
the Romans. It is of &s;trong but clum&s;y workman&s;hip, and
is in no degree entitled to notice, except as a monument of
antiquity. The cathedral contains the bones of St. Lucius,
richly ornamented after the fa&s;hion of Roman Catholic
<PB N="325" REF="339">
relics. The chapter con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-four canons, of
whom &s;ix are re&s;ident. The inhabitants of this di&s;trict are
all Catholics.</P>
<P>ABOVE the palace, and upon the highe&s;t extremity of the
town, is the convent of St. Lucius. It takes its name from
a &s;mall chapel dedicated to that &s;aint, who, according to the
legends of the Romi&s;h church, was a king of England in the
latter end of the &s;econd century. Having embraced Chri&s;ti|anity,
and being inflamed with religious zeal, he quitted his
throne, and wandering into the&s;e parts built an hermitage
upon the &s;pot where his chapel now &s;tands, and by his
preaching and example converted numbers to a belief of the
go&s;pel. He is &s;tyled the apo&s;tle of the Gri&s;ons, and is greatly
revered as a &s;aint by the Catholics, while the Prote&s;tants of
the town pay him not the lea&s;t veneration. Burnet, in his
Travels, relates, that he endeavoured &startq;<HI>to &s;hew the good old
bi&s;hop that the legend of Lucius was a fable in all the parts of
it, but mo&s;t remarkable in that which related to the Gri&s;ons;
and that we had no kings in Britain at that time, but were a
province to the Romans; that no ancient authors &s;peak of it,
Bede being the fir&s;t that mentions it; and that the pretended
letter to pope Eleutherius, together with his an&s;wer, has evident
characters of forgery in it. All this,</HI> he adds, <HI>&s;ignified nothing
to the bi&s;hop, who a&s;&s;ured me that they had a tradition of that
in their church, and it was in&s;erted in their Breviary, which he
firmly believed.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>WELL aware, that my endeavours to convince the monk$
of the fal&s;ity of the legend would have ended as un&s;ucce&s;s|fully
<PB N="326" REF="340">
as the rea&s;oning of Burnet, I did not imitate his ex|ample;
but without entering into the merits or demerits of
the &s;tory, contented my&s;elf with admiring the beautiful
pro&s;pect, which was the motive that induced me to vi&s;it the
convent. The environs of Coire are delightful. The plain
is richly diver&s;ified with corn and pa&s;ture; the hills gra|dually
&s;loping to the foot of the mountains are covered with
vines, which yield wine of an agreeable flavour, but not
&s;trong. The points of view vary &s;upri&s;ingly, from agree|able
to romantic, from romantic to wild. The Rhine, which
flows rapidly through the plain, about the di&s;tance of a mile,
begins here to be navigable by rafts, and merchandi&s;e is
tran&s;ported toward Lindau and Zuric.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">CASTLE OF HALDENSTEIN&mdash;SEMINARY OF
LITERATURE.</HEAD>
<P>I RODE this evening, in company with two gentlemen of
Coire, who have favoured me with great marks of atten|tion
and politene&s;s, to Halden&s;tein, which may be called the
&s;malle&s;t &s;overeignty in Europe. We pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;ide
of the hills, and at the bottom of the rugged rocks which
lead to the League of the Ten Juri&s;dictions; and enjoyed
the whole way a fine view of the rich plain, &s;tretching from
the town of Coire as far as Embs. The beautiful verdure
of the meadows, the &s;loping hills clothed with vines, the
craggy mountains, partly covered with vines, partly over|&s;pread
with wood, and partly bare, formed altogether a
&s;triking pro&s;pect. We cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine to Halden&s;tein, a
&s;mall village con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ixty hou&s;es, and proceeded
to the hou&s;e occupied by the pre&s;ent baron, Rhodolph de
Salis, who received me with great politene&s;s, and kindly in|dulged
my curio&s;ity, by &s;hewing me his little territory, and
an&s;wering my inquiries with great readine&s;s and exactne&s;s.
The baron, a gentleman of con&s;iderable learning and inde|fatigable
indu&s;try, has formed a large collection of manu|&s;cripts
relative to the Gri&s;ons, from which he has drawn
ample materials for a publication, in which he is at pre&s;ent
engaged. His re&s;earches are chiefly biographical; and his
<PB N="328" REF="342">
work is intended to illu&s;trate the memoirs of the principal
per&s;ons, who have rendered them&s;elves con&s;picuous among
the Gri&s;ons by their actions and abilities<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>This work is announced as not yet fini&s;hed, in Haller's</HI> Schweitzer-Bibliothek, <HI>vol. II. p.</HI> 364, <HI>under the following titles:</HI> 1. Rhaetia Illu&s;trata, contenant l'hi&s;toire ou les principaux &eacute;venemens de la vie des Hommes c&eacute;l&eacute;bres qui ont paru au pais des Gri&s;ons. 2. Rhaetia Literaria, ou Catalogue de tous les auteurs Gri&s;ons, de leur vie, et de leurs ouvrages.</P>
<P>The baron is &s;ince dead, and I have not heard that the&s;e works have been publi&s;hed.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the barony of Halden&s;tein, he informed
me, that it was formerly under the protection of the &s;even
ancient cantons of Switzerland; that &s;ince the year 1568, it
has been an independent &s;overeignty, under the protection
of the three leagues; that in the middle of the &s;ixteenth
century it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in right of marriage by John de
Ca&s;tron, French amba&s;&s;ador to the Republic of the Gri&s;ons,
and at his death, in 1565, came into the family of Schauen|&s;tein:
that the male line being extinct, it was divided be|tween
two females of the collateral branches, one of whom
married a de Salis, and the other an Hartmannis. In the
beginning of this century the de&s;cendants of de Salis
purcha&s;ed the other half, and again reunited it under one
per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE whole barony con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall &s;emicircular plain,
which lies between the Rhine and the bottom of the Calendar,
about five miles in length, and &s;carcely one in breadth. It oc|cupies
al&s;o part of the mountain, which is &s;o &s;teep as not to
be inhabited. It contains only two villages, that of Halden|&s;tein
and Sewils, and the whole number of &s;ubjects amount
<PB N="329" REF="343">
to no more than between three and four hundred. The
people were &s;erfs or va&s;&s;als, until the year 1701, when the
grandfather of the pre&s;ent baron gave to them &s;everal im|munities.
At pre&s;ent the lord has territorial juri&s;diction;
the exclu&s;ive privilege of hunting and fi&s;hing; a claim
of two days work annually from each of his &s;ubjects, and a
load of dung from each pea&s;ant. He appoints the judge in
the criminal court, receives the fines for offences, from
which he pays the expences of the proce&s;s, and has the
power of pardoning. He nominates the pre&s;ident, and part
of the jury in civil cau&s;es, and in all ca&s;es of appeal judges in
the la&s;t re&s;ort. The baron &s;hewed me &s;everal coins &s;truck
by his predece&s;&s;ors: the mo&s;t ancient was a gold piece of
1611, the year in which the emperor Matthias conferred the
right of coining money upon the baron of Halden&s;tein; a
privilege which he &s;till enjoys.</P>
<P>THE ancient ca&s;tle of Halden&s;tein, from which the barons
took their title, is now in ruins; but its remains are &s;till vi|&s;ible
upon the &s;ides of the mountain: above it is another
ruined ca&s;tle called Lichten&s;tein, which was formerly inha|bited
by an ance&s;tor of prince Lichten&s;tein of Vienna, and
from which he is &s;aid to derive his title. The prince is &s;o
convinced of his de&s;cent from the ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this
ca&s;tle, and &s;o proud of their antiquity, that he was at the ex|pence
of procuring a &s;tone from the&s;e ruins, for the founda|tion
&s;tone of a &s;uperb palace which he has built at Vienna,
that it might be &s;aid to contain &s;ome materials of the origi|nal
ca&s;tle in which his ance&s;tors once re&s;ided. The pre&s;ent
<PB N="330" REF="344">
hou&s;e, occupied by the baron of Halden&s;tein, was built
in 1545, by James de Ca&s;trio; it is plea&s;antly &s;ituated near
the Rhine, and commands a fine view of the town of Coire,
and the adjacent country.</P>
<P>A FEW years ago the ca&s;tle of Halden&s;tein was converted
into a &s;eminary for the education of youth. An enquiry into
the origin of this in&s;titution, and the cau&s;e of its &s;ub&s;equent
decline, has led me to gain &s;ome in&s;ight into the general
&s;tate of literature in this country. It had long been a &s;erious
cau&s;e of complaint, that in the whole country of the Gri&s;ons
there was no public &s;eminary for completing the education
of youth; and that all who followed any of the learned pro|fe&s;&s;ions
were obliged to repair to foreign academies. M. de
Salis of Marchlins, and &s;ome other per&s;ons of the fir&s;t con&s;e|quence
among the Gri&s;ons, con&s;idering this defect a di&s;grace
to their country, projected a plan for the in&s;titution of an
academy; and having obtained the ratification of the general
diet, which a&s;&s;embled at Davos in 1761, carried it into im|mediate
execution at their own expence, with a zeal for lite|rature
which reflects the highe&s;t honour upon their exer|tions.
The plan was exten&s;ive and u&s;eful, and &s;eemed well
calculated to &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s: for a &s;hort time it wore a flou|ri&s;hing
appearance; but this pro&s;perous beginning was not
&s;ucceeded by any beneficial con&s;equences. Its decline was owing
to the little countenance given to literature; was ha&s;tened by
quarrels which aro&s;e between the profe&s;&s;ors; and in 1779,
within the &s;pace of fifteen years from its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment,
the in&s;titution was di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="345">
THE general &s;tate of literature among the Gri&s;ons is at a
very low ebb. One of the mo&s;t learned men in this country,
and who would be far from depreciating the knowledge of
his countrymen without &s;ufficient foundation, thus ex|pre&s;&s;es
him&s;elf upon this head<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In Rhaetia no&s;tra rerum admini&s;tratio omnium a plebe dependet, cujus numerus potior non ni&s;i quae ante na&s;um &s;unt, aut lucrum ad|&s;erunt, &s;apit, quicquid de reliquo agatur, lit|teras politiores, cum omni gloria et commodis quae ex illis &s;ub&s;equuntur, qua&s;i rejicienda contemnit; nullum carum profe&s;&s;oribus pre|mium, nullum meritum, laudem nullum tri|buit; &s;ic ut qui litteras ament, et excolant, ex genero&s;o quopiam animi impetu id agant, &s;epa|&s;ito omni alio fine, et ab&s;que ullo ad cas calcari.

<P>THE Prote&s;tants who receive a liberal education repair
for the mo&s;t part to Zuric or Ba&s;le, and the Catholics to
Milan, Pavia, or Vienna. Each community has a &s;mall

another, in&s;tituted in 1763, for the education of per&s;ons in|tended

<HEAD TYPE="sub">LEAGUE OF TEN JURISDICTIONS&mdash;FATZEROL&mdash;BATHS
OF ALVENEW&mdash;DAVOS&mdash;VALLEY OF PRE|TIGAU&mdash;MALANTZ&mdash;MAYENFIELD&mdash;BATHS OF
PFEFFERS.</HEAD>
<P>I QUITTED Coire ye&s;terday morning, in order to make an
excur&s;ion into the League of the Ten Juri&s;dictions; but
before I proceed in my account of this expedition, I &s;hall
&s;end you a &s;hort ab&s;tract of this league, from its fir&s;t founda|tion
to its perfect independency. This league ought pro|perly
to be called, and indeed is not unfrequently denomi|nated
in this country, the League of the <HI>Eleven</HI> Juri&s;dic|tions,
from the number of communities of which it is
compo&s;ed; but as upon its fir&s;t union it was formed of ten
juri&s;dictions, it &s;till retains its original appellation, although
one of the juri&s;dictions has been &s;ince that period &s;ubdi|vided
into two.</P>
<P>THE territory of this league was formerly under the do|minion
of the barons of Vats, who&s;e authority was limited,
as the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very con&s;iderable privileges. Upon
the death of Donatus, the la&s;t baron, the count of Togge|burg,
who had married his elde&s;t daughter, &s;ucceeded to his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and Frederic, one of his de&s;cendants, dying in
1436 without i&s;&s;ue, the &s;everal communities united, formed
an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive alliance, and erected them&s;elves
<PB N="334" REF="348">
into a league. But although by this alliance they increa&s;ed
their immunities, yet they were by no means perfectly inde|pendent;
for the male heirs of the count of Toggeburg ob|tained
the lord&s;hip over the&s;e juri&s;dictions, after having
confirmed all their privileges, and added others. Afterwards
Sigi&s;mond, archduke of Au&s;tria and count of Tyrol, pur|cha&s;ed
the baronial rights. Upon his death they devolved
to his heir, Maximilian the Fir&s;t, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of that
emperor. The&s;e prerogatives con&s;i&s;ted in the appointment,
in &s;everal of the communities, of the criminal judge, in the
power of pardoning, in receiving part of the fines, in nomi|nating
the principal magi&s;trates from three candidates, and
in other &s;imilar privileges, which gave to the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria con&s;iderable influence in the interior admini|&s;tration
of affairs. The&s;e rights, exerci&s;ed by means of a
governor who re&s;ided at Ca&s;tels, but who could not be ap|pointed
without the concurrence of the league, were gra|dually
annihilated, either by purcha&s;e or conce&s;&s;ion; the
&s;everal communities became entirely independent; and this
independence was &s;olemnly ratified by the emperor Ferdi|nand
the Third, &s;oon after the peace of We&s;tphalia.</P>
<P>AFTER about half an hour's a&s;cent from Coire, I entered
the League of the Ten Juri&s;dictions near Malix; pa&s;&s;ed
along the vale, and through the community of Churwalden,
in which the hamlets lie prettily &s;cattered about the plain,
and upon the &s;ides of the mountains. I made a &s;mall circuit
in order to pa&s;s through the village of Fatzerol, which con|&s;i&s;ts
only of five or &s;ix hou&s;es, and &s;tands at the bottom of
&s;ome very high and rugged mountains; it is celebrated in
<PB N="335" REF="349">
the hi&s;tory of the Gri&s;ons as being the place where, in 1471,
the fir&s;t perpetual alliance was ratified by the deputies of
the three leagues. I was accompanied to the &s;pot by one of
the principal inhabitants, who was not di&s;plea&s;ed with the
enthu&s;ia&s;m I te&s;tified at beholding the birth-place of their
liberties. The hou&s;e is now in ruins, and the apartment
which was remarkable for the meeting of the deputies no
longer remains. Having, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my com|panion,
traced its &s;ite, I con&s;idered with re&s;pect the &s;pot
which was once &s;anctified by the ratification of the general
union; lamented that &s;o venerable a pile of building &s;hould
be &s;uffered to fall into decay; and felt di&s;appointment, that
there was no in&s;cription by public authority, in order to
con&s;ign to po&s;terity the date of the tran&s;action, and to con|&s;ecrate
the place which had been witne&s;s to an event the
mo&s;t memorable in the annals of this country.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity in viewing the&s;e re|&s;pectable
remains, I de&s;cended through Brientz to the baths
of Alvenew. The &s;ource which gives celebrity to Alvenew
is &s;ulphureous, and re&s;embles both in &s;mell and ta&s;te the
waters of Harrowgate. The &s;ituation of the&s;e baths is highly
romantic, by the &s;ide of the torrent Albula, at the bottom of
the maje&s;tic Alps. Having pa&s;&s;ed through Alvenew and
Anderwi&s;en, I mounted a very &s;teep rugged a&s;cent through a
thick fore&s;t, and then pur&s;ued a narrow path upon the &s;ide
of a rock called Zug, over a &s;teep precipice, with a torrent
flowing beneath. This rock is mo&s;tly bare, excepting a few
&s;tubbed &s;irs, the remains of a fore&s;t which was formerly de|&s;troyed
by fire; hence it is called the <HI>Burnt Wood,</HI> and exhi|bits
<PB N="336" REF="350">
a mo&s;t de&s;olate appearance. At the bottom of this rock,
clo&s;e to the torrent, are mines of &s;ilver, which were formerly
worked. I entered the juri&s;diction of Davos at the village of
Glarus, and took up my lodging in a neat cottage.</P>
<P>THE di&s;trict of Davos is a long plain, about a quarter of a
mile broad, gradually ri&s;ing into hills, which terminate in
high mountains. It is not unlike the valley of Upper Enga|dina,
but is more fertile. Near the church of St. John there
is a &s;mall clu&s;ter of eight or ten hou&s;es contiguous to each
other: in the other parts the cottages are thickly &s;trewed
over the plain, and upon the gentle acclivities, as in the can|ton
of Appenzel, each with its little territory. The coun|try
produces oats, rye, large quantities of rich pa&s;ture, and
yields two crops of hay in one &s;ea&s;on. It is now the &s;econd
harve&s;t, and the fields are covered with mowers. The bor|dering
mountains are over&s;pread to their &s;ummits with
fore&s;ts of fir and larch, intermixed with meadows: above
them tower the rugged Alps. A clear murmuring &s;tream
flows through the mid&s;t of the plain, with a gentle though
lively cour&s;e; its banks prettily ornamented with &s;cattered
cottages, which are remarkably neat and commodious.
Some are built of trees piled one upon another; others have
&s;tone foundations, and the upper part of wood; others are
con&s;tructed with &s;tone plai&s;tered and white-wa&s;hed. I
walked to the valley of Die&s;ma, leading to Scampf in Upper
Engadina, which is clo&s;ed at &s;ome di&s;tance by a high
mountain covered with &s;now, &s;aid to be one of the mo&s;t ele|vated
in the country of the Gri&s;ons. It is called the Swart-Horn,
and is part of the Scaletta Alps, which communicates
<PB N="337" REF="351">
with the Julian Alps, the Set, and the chain that &s;eparates
the Valteline from Upper Engadina and Pregalia. Clo&s;e to
my inn is the town-hou&s;e, in which the deputies compo&s;ing
the general diet of the Gri&s;ons are a&s;&s;embled every three
years. It is al&s;o the place of meeting for the deputies of this
league, who a&s;&s;emble annually in the month of May, for the
choice of the <HI>Bunds Landamman,</HI> or chief of the league, and
for the tran&s;acting of any particular bu&s;ine&s;s. It is plain
and &s;imple, like the people them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed in this di&s;trict of
Davos is &s;imilar to that of the &s;mall cantons of Switzerland,
and is entirely democratical. The people mu&s;t be a&s;&s;embled
upon all extraordinary occa&s;ions, &s;uch as enacting new laws,
deciding upon appeals from the general diet, and rai&s;ing
money. Every male at the age of fourteen has a vote. The
whole collective body of the people, however, do not meet in
order to chu&s;e their magi&s;trates, who are elected from depu|ties
&s;ent by each di&s;trict. The admini&s;tration of affairs re&s;ides
in the great council of eighty-two, and the council of fifteen,
which is included in the former. The great council regu|lates
all affairs relating to finance; the fifteen &s;uperintend
the police, and are judges in the civil and criminal courts of
ju&s;tice without appeal<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that through the whole League of the Ten Juri&s;dictions there is no appeal from the deci&s;ion of the civil courts of ju&s;tice, excepting in the community of Alvenew. The inhabitants of that place being Catholic and Prote&s;tant, there lies an appeal to the civil tribunal ei|ther of Churwalden or of Davos.</NOTE>. In criminal ca&s;es torture cannot
be inflicted without permi&s;&s;ion of the great council. The
Landamman is elected every two years, and is pre&s;ident of
<PB N="338" REF="352">
both the&s;e councils. This remote corner has produced &s;e|veral
per&s;ons eminent in literature; and particularly the
two hi&s;torians of the Gri&s;ons, Guler and Sprecher.</P>
<P>JOHN GULER was born 1562, and died in 1637, at a very
advanced age. He was remarkable for his multifarious
knowledge; and publi&s;hed, in 1616, in the German tongue,
&startq;an account of the three Gri&s;on Leagues, and other Rhe|tian
people.&endq; In this work, much e&s;teemed by the natives,
the author gives a circum&s;tantial detail of the origin of the
antient Rhetians, and of their emigration from Tu&s;cany into
this country under their leader Rhaetus; traces their &s;ub&s;e|quent
hi&s;tory under the Romans, and in the dark ages, to
the beginning of the fifteenth century, when the union of
the three leagues was e&s;tabli&s;hed. Guler has illu&s;trated the
hi&s;tory of ancient and modern Rhetia by wooden engravings
of medals, towns, and battles; genealogical tables, coats of
arms, and maps; which, though rude, are curious for their
antiquity. The author had al&s;o meditated a &s;econd volume,
on the union of the three leagues, on the topography and
hi&s;tory of the whole country, and on the tran&s;actions of his
own times. For this part of the work Guler was eminently
qualified; as well from his exten&s;ive erudition, and for hav|ing
carefully dige&s;ted Campel's account of the Gri&s;ons<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 73.</NOTE>, as
from the various offices to which he was rai&s;ed both in
the civil and military line, and the repeated emba&s;&s;ies
and negociations in which he was employed. It is,
however, uncertain whether this part was ever fini&s;hed;
<PB N="339" REF="353">
and if fini&s;hed, it is probably lo&s;t: as Mr. Aporta has
&s;earched for it without &s;ucce&s;s in the libraries and among
the manu&s;cripts of his countrymen<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Aporta Hi&s;t. Refor. Ecc. Raet. Praefat.&mdash;Haller, in his Schweit&punc; Bib. N^o 814. &s;ays, that it was already prepared for the pre&s;s, but was unfortunately burnt.</NOTE> The deficiency of this
valuable performance, however, is fortunately &s;upplied by
Fortunatus Sprecher, the contemporary, friend, and relation,
of Guler. Sprecher was born in 1584; and in 1617 gave to
the world <HI>Pallas Rhaetica armata et togata;</HI> or the military
and civil hi&s;tory of the Gri&s;ons from the earlie&s;t ages to the
aera in which the book was publi&s;hed. In this work, which
is a model for method and per&s;picuity, the author gives the
national hi&s;tory, in ten books. The fir&s;t contains the emi|gration
of the Tu&s;cans, their &s;ettlement in this country, the
de&s;cription of the antient Rhetians, and their tran&s;actions to
the time of Augu&s;tus. The &s;econd compri&s;es the period
from the Augu&s;tan aera to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the empire of
the Franks. The third treats of the Gri&s;ons under the em|pires
of the Franks and Germans, till 1476. The fourth details
the wars of the Gri&s;ons; namely, the Swabian war again&s;t
Maximilian the Fir&s;t, and the campaigns again&s;t James of
Medici, from 1525 to 1531. The fifth compri&s;es the wars in
which the Gri&s;ons were engaged under the &s;tandards of
foreign powers. The &s;ixth relates the union and political
&s;tate of the three leagues, and their alliances with the Swi&s;s
and other powers. The &s;eventh, eighth, and ninth, &s;epa|rately
de&s;cribe the Grey League; the bi&s;hopric of Coire, and
the League of God's Hou&s;e; and the League of Ten Juri&s;|dictions.
<PB N="340" REF="354">
The tenth concludes with an account of the Val|teline,
Chiavenna, and Bormio. A &s;econd volume, which
appeared in 1629, under the title of, <HI>Hi&s;toria Motuum et
Bellorum po&s;tremis hi&s;ce annis in Rhetia excitatorum et ge&s;to|rum,</HI>
relates the wars and troubles of the Gri&s;ons from 1617
to 1629; a period of turbulence and di&s;cord. A third
volume continued the hi&s;tory of the Gri&s;ons from 1627 to a
&s;hort time before the author's death, which happened in
1647; but has never been given to the public.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the extremity of the beautiful valley of Davos
is a &s;mall lake, about four miles in circumference, which is
remarkably deep and clear, and abounds with excellent
trout. It lies at the foot of the mountains, and &s;upplies a
&s;mall &s;tream, which being joined by one from the valley of
Flola, and by another from that of Die&s;ma, forms the mur|muring
brook that waters the valley of Davos, and falls into
the Albula above the baths of Alvenew: it is con&s;idered by
&s;ome writers as forming a &s;ource of the Rhine.</P>
<P>FROM the banks of this lake I de&s;cended to another, about
half a mile in circumference, that lies in a wild and romantic
&s;ituation, and &s;upplies a &s;mall torrent, which is the &s;ource of
the Lanquart, traver&s;ed a &s;mall plea&s;ant plain &s;trewed with cot|tages,
which compo&s;e the village of Lower Lera; at the extre|mity
of which the de&s;cent was &s;o &s;teep and rugged, that I di&s;|mounted
until I reached the vale of Pretigau. I pa&s;&s;ed through
Clo&s;ter, Kublis, Jenat&s;ch, and Schiers, following all the way
the torrent Lanquart. The country is delightful, and
<PB N="341" REF="355">
greatly diver&s;ified with all kinds of productions. It yields
different &s;pecies of grain, rich pa&s;tures, abundance of fruit|trees,
with large quantities of flax and hemp: the hemp is
much cultivated, and &s;eems to be carried to great perfection.
The pea&s;ants manufacture coar&s;e but very &s;trong linen
from this hemp. The mountains on each &s;ide are in &s;ome
parts covered with fore&s;ts; and &s;o great is the abundance of
wood, that the fields are either &s;tudded or &s;kirted with larch,
pines, and beech. The hamlets are &s;cattered through the
plain, and along the declivities of the mountains, in a very
plea&s;ing manner. The hou&s;es are mo&s;tly of wood, in the
Swi&s;s mode of con&s;truction, and not le&s;s convenient. The
road through this vale de&s;cends gently all the way. I have
not for &s;ome time vi&s;ited a more agreeable, fertile, and popu|lous
di&s;trict.</P>
<P>A LITTLE beyond Gru&s;ch, which lies under &s;ome bare
rocks in a fertile plain, the valley of Pretigau contracts; and
the road leads through a narrow pa&s;s between impending
rocks, ju&s;t broad enough to admit the torrent and the road.
The &s;udden change from the fertility of the country to the
rugged barrenne&s;s of this &s;pot, &s;ufficiently &s;triking of it&s;elf,
was &s;till further heightened by the gloom of the evening,
which added to the horror of the &s;cenery. The road was
carried for &s;ome way in continued a&s;cent and de&s;cent along
the craggy precipices, &s;ometimes above, and &s;ometimes upon
a level with the torrent. The path was &s;o narrow and rug|ged,
that I gave my hor&s;e to the guide, and continued my
way on foot. I &s;oon emerged from this ob&s;cure pa&s;s, and, as
<PB N="342" REF="356">
far as I could judge by the dim light of the &s;tars, came into a
fine and rich country, and went through a &s;eries of vineyards
to Malantz, in the di&s;trict of Mayenfield.</P>
<P>THE High Juri&s;diction of Mayenfield is the mo&s;t re|markable
in the whole country of the Gri&s;ons, becau&s;e the
inhabitants are re&s;pectively &s;overeign and &s;ubjects. They
are &s;overeign, becau&s;e they form part of the League of the
Ten Juri&s;dictions, &s;end deputies to the general diet of the
Gri&s;ons, and nominate to the governments of the &s;ubject pro|vinces.
They are &s;ubject, becau&s;e, like the &s;ubject provinces,
they are governed by a bailif &s;ent from the Gri&s;ons, who is
changed every two years, and in whom re&s;ides the &s;upreme
authority. This &s;trange intermixture of privileges and &s;ub|jection
is derived from the following cau&s;es. The lord&s;hip of
Mayenfield was, like the whole territory of this league, &s;ub|ject
to the counts of Toggenburgh, and, in 1436, joined the
other communities to form a league. In 1509, the preroga|tives
enjoyed by the count of Toggenburgh were &s;old, by his
heirs, for 20, 000 florins, to the three leagues, which confirm|ed
the privileges of the inhabitants. In 1537, Malantz and
Jennins, the remaining part of this High Juri&s;diction, were al&s;o
purcha&s;ed by the three leagues for 10, 000 florins. Thus, while
the inhabitants of all the other juri&s;dictions, who came under
the dominion of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, have purcha&s;ed their
ab&s;olute independence, the people of Mayenfield and Malantz,
although making part of the &s;overeign power, have con|tinued
in the &s;ame &s;tate as at the fir&s;t formation of the
leagues. The bailif or governor is appointed by the com|munities
<PB N="343" REF="357">
of the three leagues in rotation; and the inhabi|tants
of this very High Juri&s;diction nominate the bailif, when
it is their turn to pre&s;ent to the office.</P>
<P>THE prerogatives of the bailif, who re&s;ides at Mayenfield,
are as follow: he appoints the <HI>Stadvogt,</HI> or chief magi&s;trate
of that town, with this condition, that he mu&s;t be a member
of the &s;enate; upon a vacancy in the &s;enate or little council,
he nominates the new &s;enator; the arre&s;ts criminals, ex|amines
them, and makes a compo&s;ition if he chu&s;es; he
cannot order torture or pa&s;s &s;entence without the con|currence
of the members of the criminal tribunal<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The members of this tribunal con&s;i&s;t of &s;ix judges from the di&s;trict of Mayenfield, and &s;ix from that of Malantz, three from Jennins, and two from Flae&s;ch.</NOTE>, and
when they pa&s;s &s;entence can pardon; he can give a libera|tion,
in the &s;ame manner as the governor of the Valteline<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 76.</NOTE>;
he receives part of the fines for criminal offences, and a cer|tain
portion of the great tythes; at Malantz he appoints the
chief magi&s;trate from three candidates pre&s;ented by the peo|ple,
who choo&s;e all the other magi&s;trates. Both Mayenfield
and Malantz have their civil courts, from that of the former
there lies an appeal to the bailif.</P>
<P>FROM Malantz, a &s;mall but hand&s;ome town lying upon
the &s;ide of an hill, I de&s;cended into a rich plain of pa&s;ture,
about three miles in breadth, cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine, and &s;oon
afterwards a&s;cended into the county of Sargans, through
hanging groves of larch, fir, birch, beech, and oak. The
eminence commands a fine view, on the other &s;ide of the
<PB N="344" REF="358">
Rhine, of hills gently ri&s;ing from the bed of the river into
mountains. Upon this chain are &s;ituated Mayenfield, Ma|lantz,
Jennins, and Flae&s;ch, &s;urrounded by corn-fields,
meadows, and vineyards: it &s;eemed to me the riche&s;t part of
this country. I ob&s;erved beyond the confines of the Gri&s;ons,
at a little di&s;tance, the road<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Letter 5.</NOTE> which I pa&s;&s;ed in 1776, in
travelling from Appenzel to Wallen&s;tadt.</P>
<P>HAVING reached Pfeffers, I left my hor&s;e at the village,
where there is an abbey of Benedictine monks, the abbot of
which is a prince of the empire, and took a guide to the
baths of the &s;ame name, which are di&s;tant about three miles.
I pa&s;&s;ed through a thick fore&s;t of beech, down a &s;teep and
rugged path, to the hou&s;e which the abbot has built for the
reception of the company. Formerly the accommodations
were extremely indifferent; and the de&s;cent into the baths
was attended with great inconvenience, if not with danger.
Affairs are now greatly changed: the waters are conveyed
by pipes into commodious baths; and the hou&s;e, which is
not only commodious, but &s;uperb, hangs in a mo&s;t roman|tic
&s;ituation on the &s;ide of the mountain, amid&s;t the gloom
of the fore&s;t, clo&s;e to the lively Tamina.</P>
<P>BEING de&s;irous of vi&s;iting the warm &s;ource, I cro&s;&s;ed the
Tamina, over a wooden bridge, and entered in a cha&s;m, or
narrow opening in a rock of lime-&s;tone, through which that
torrent has forced its way. The cha&s;m is from ten to
twenty feet broad, and from two to three hundred feet high.
<PB N="345" REF="359">
In &s;ome places it is open at top and over&s;pread with &s;hrubs;
in &s;ome its &s;ides converge and almo&s;t touch; in others it is
quite clo&s;ed with enormous ma&s;&s;es of fallen rock, and
&s;carcely admits a feeble ray of light. The pa&s;&s;age along this
cha&s;m is quite dreadful; and my head almo&s;t turns giddy at
the bare recollection. I went along a kind of &s;caffolding erected
for the purpo&s;e of &s;upporting a wooden aqueduct, through
which the waters are conveyed to the baths: the planks
upon which I walked, either re&s;ting upon long beams, or
&s;u&s;pended by iron cramps driven into the &s;ides of the rock,
hang over the torrent. I was frequently obliged to &s;toop
for a con&s;iderable way, in order to avoid the impending
rock: in &s;ome places I traver&s;ed a &s;ingle plank, which forms
a kind of bridge &s;u&s;pended over the gulf, tottering under
my weight, and &s;o narrow that I walked &s;ideways. In this
manner I continued for near a quarter of an hour before I
reached the warm &s;prings, which gu&s;h abundantly from the
crevices of the rock. Here the baths were formerly con|&s;tructed:
the hou&s;es for the reception of the &s;ick were built
upon a platform, under the over-hanging crags; a &s;ituation
&s;o dreary, that the de&s;cription given by the writers of the la&s;t
century no longer appears in the lea&s;t degree exaggerated.
Willing to convey a general idea of their gloomine&s;s, they
repre&s;ent the&s;e dwellings as never receiving the rays of the
&s;un, and &s;o dark that the inhabitants were accu&s;tomed to
u&s;e candles at mid-day. The approach to the baths was very
inconvenient: the company de&s;cended ranges of perpendi|cular
ladders, or were let down by ropes. As the rocks have
fallen, and overwhelmed the&s;e &s;ubterraneous dwellings, I
<PB N="346" REF="360">
could ob&s;erve no traces of them, except &s;ome holes in the
rock for the beams which &s;upported the hou&s;es.</P>
<P>THESE baths have been &s;o renowned for their efficacy in
curing the gout, rheumati&s;m, and cutaneous di&s;orders,
that, according to the general opinion, they contain a &s;mall
portion of gold; as if that metal would render them more
&s;alutary for the cure of di&s;ea&s;es. The waters are tran&s;pa|rent,
perfectly free from &s;mell or ta&s;te, and about the
warmth of milk immediately drawn from the cow. Per&s;ons
who have analy&s;ed them &s;ay, that they depo&s;it no &s;ediment,
are as light and pure as rain-water, are impregnated with a
&s;mall quantity of volatile alcali and iron, but contain no
&s;ulphur. I returned from this &s;ource through the &s;ame
cha&s;m, and along the &s;ame tottering &s;caffolding, and was not
di&s;plea&s;ed when I i&s;&s;ued again into day. I then mounted to
the village of Pfeffers, de&s;cended into the plain of the Rhine,
and ha&s;tened to Coire.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">UNION OF THE THREE LEAGUES&mdash;DIET&mdash;CONSTI|TUENT
PARTS&mdash;MODE OF CHOOSING THE DEPU|TIES&mdash;ANALOGY
BETWEEN THE GRISON DIET
AND THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT, ACCORDING TO
THE PLAN OF EXTENDING TO THE PEOPLE AT
LARGE THE RIGHT OF ELECTING REPRESENTA|TIVES&mdash;REMARKS
ON THE INEXPEDIENCY OF
THAT PLAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE country of the Gri&s;ons is divided into three
leagues, which unite and form one republic; the
Grey League, the Cad&eacute;e, or the Hou&s;e of God, and the Ten
Juri&s;dictions. The re&s;pective communities of the&s;e three
leagues have their peculiar con&s;titution, enjoy their muni|cipal
laws and cu&s;toms, and are independent commonwealths
in all concerns, which do not interfere with the general policy
of the whole republic, or the articles of the particular league
of which they form a part.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that the preci&s;e period at which the
three leagues formally united to compo&s;e one general re|public
cannot be a&s;certained from any po&s;itive record in the
annals of this country. Campel, the be&s;t hi&s;torian of the
Gri&s;ons, places this event about 1436<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sprecher, however, in his Pallas Rhaetica, &s;ixes the union of the three leagues in 1471, p. 228. Elz. edit. Mo&s;t of the Gri&s;on hi&s;torians follow Sprecher.</NOTE>. For though the fir&s;t
<PB N="348" REF="362">
articles of union which are tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity were
drawn up in 1524; it is plain that there were others of an|terior
date, becau&s;e it is therein expre&s;sly mentioned, that
the &s;aid articles were compiled from a former treaty, with
great additions. This union has &s;ince been frequently re|newed
at different periods; but the &s;ame articles remain
without any alteration.</P>
<P>THE connection between the three leagues is maintained
by means of an annual diet, of the congre&s;s, and of the three
chiefs. The diet is compo&s;ed of &s;ixty-three deputies, and
the three chiefs. Of the&s;e deputies the Grey League &s;end
twenty-&s;even, the Hou&s;e of God twenty-two, and the Ten
Juri&s;dictions fourteen. They are cho&s;en in the &s;everal com|munities
by every male of a &s;tated age<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The age which entitles them to vote is not exactly the &s;ame in all communities; in &s;ome it commences as early as fourteen.</NOTE>. The diet a&s;&s;embles
annually about the beginning of September at Ilants, Coire,
and Davos, by rotation, and continues &s;itting about three
weeks or a month. The chief of that league, in who&s;e di&s;|trict
the diet is held, is pre&s;ident for that turn, and has the
ca&s;ting voice in ca&s;e of equal &s;uffrages. The &s;upreme au|thority
is not ab&s;olutely and finally ve&s;ted in the diet, but
in the communities at large; for in all affairs of importance,
&s;uch as declaring war, making peace, enacting laws, con|tracting
alliances, and impo&s;ing taxes, the deputies either
bring po&s;itive in&s;tructions from their con&s;tituents, or refer
tho&s;e points, concerning which they have no in&s;tructions, to
the deci&s;ion of the &s;everal communities; &s;o that in effect the
<PB N="349" REF="363">
&s;upreme power con&s;titutionally re&s;ides in the body of the peo|ple,
and not in their repre&s;entatives at the diet. All que&s;tions
in the diet are carried or rejected by a majority of voices: the
mode of voting is as follows. In all ca&s;es where the commu|nities
&s;end in&s;tructions, the deputies deliver them to the &s;ecre|tary,
who reads them aloud: if the&s;e in&s;tructions are ob&s;curely
worded, as &s;ometimes happens, either through accident or
de&s;ign, the diet determines by a majority, in what &s;en&s;e they
&s;hall be taken. In re&s;olutions, which, for want of in&s;truc|tions,
are &s;ubject, after the deci&s;ion of the diet, to the revi&s;al
of the communities, each member is at liberty to vote as he
choo&s;es. The three chiefs have no &s;uffrage, when the com|munities
&s;end their in&s;tructions, becau&s;e they are not repre|&s;entatives:
but in all ca&s;es which are either not referable to
the communities, or which are afterwards to be &s;ubmitted
to the communities, they vote in the &s;ame manner as the
deputies.</P>
<P>IT is worthy of remark, that although each deputy has
the power of bringing in any bill, or propo&s;ing any que&s;|tion;
yet he can only communicate it to the a&s;&s;embly
through the medium of the pre&s;ident: the latter may lay
it before the a&s;&s;embly, without any previous notice, at any
time before its di&s;&s;olution; a privilege, which nece&s;&s;arily in|ve&s;ts
him with great influence in promoting or oppo&s;ing the
&s;ucce&s;s of a motion. The deputies receive, for their attend|ance,
a &s;mall &s;alary from the public trea&s;ury, which never
exceeds five &s;hillings a day.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="364">
EXTRAORDINARY diets are convoked at the reque&s;t of
any foreign court, who will di&s;charge the expence of its &s;it|tings,
and upon other important emergencies. This extra|ordinary
a&s;&s;embly is &s;ometimes compo&s;ed of all the deputies,
at other times of only half the number: in the latter
in&s;tance it is called a half diet. The deputies are cho&s;en in
the &s;ame manner as at the election of a general diet, and its
powers are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE ari&s;tocratical party is &s;till further &s;trengthened
by the power delegated to the congre&s;s; an a&s;&s;embly
formed by the three chiefs, and three deputies from each
league. In the Grey League the&s;e deputies are nominated
by the Landrichter; in each of the other leagues they are
cho&s;en by rotation from the &s;everal communities. This
congre&s;s generally meets in February or March, and always
at Coire, for which rea&s;on the chief of the League of God's
Hou&s;e is pre&s;ident: its office is to receive the votes of the
&s;everal communities, relative to the que&s;tions referred
to their deliberation at the la&s;t diet, and to communicate to
each of them the re&s;ult of the general deci&s;ion. Whenever
the an&s;wer of a community is not clearly worded, the con|gre&s;s
determines the meaning of that vote by the majority;
and this circum&s;tance gives an opening to much intrigue.
For, if the leading per&s;ons in any community do not chu&s;e
to form a po&s;itive deci&s;ion, they have it ob&s;curely worded,
provided they are certain, that a majority of the congre&s;s
will affix that interpretation which they de&s;ire. This a&s;|&s;embly
&s;ends out decrees to the &s;ubject countries: if &s;uch
<PB N="351" REF="365">
decrees are agreeable to the governors, they put them into
execution; but if otherwi&s;e, and they can &s;ecure a majority
at the approaching diet, they reject them, alledging that
congre&s;s has exceeded its power. The three chiefs, as well as
each of the other members of the congre&s;s, receive as a
defrayment of their expences 54 florins, or about &pound;. 4.</P>
<P>THE three chiefs a&s;&s;emble regularly three times in the
year at Coire, and upon any emergency may be al&s;o &s;um|moned
by the chief of the League of God's Hou&s;e. The
principal meeting is in the month of May, when they write
circular letters to the &s;everal communities, concerning the
que&s;tions which are to be laid before the general diet. All
the circular letters are written in German, and are tran&s;lated
into Italian or Roman&s;h by the notaries of the di&s;trict where
tho&s;e languages are &s;poken. All public acts and documents
are compiled in German: at the diet all bills are propo&s;ed
in that language; but the deputies, who do not under&s;tand
German, may &s;peak Italian.</P>
<P>THOSE theori&s;ts, who are &s;o anxious to reform the Eng|li&s;h
Hou&s;e of Commons by transferring to <HI>the people at
large</HI> the election of their repre&s;entatives in parliament,
might, on examining with attention the features of the
Gri&s;on diet, fondly imagine, that an <HI>annual</HI> a&s;&s;embly, in
the choice of who&s;e members <HI>every male</HI> of the &s;tate &s;hould
have a vote, and which, in all material occurrences, &s;hould
be liable to <HI>be directed by its con&s;tituents,</HI> mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> be
the pure&s;t &s;anctuary of general freedom. In this in&s;tance,
however, their conjectures are by no means con&s;onant to
<PB N="352" REF="366">
fact and experience; as corruption and influence are not in
any national parliament more con&s;picuous than in the diet
of the Gri&s;ons.</P>
<P>FOR although, in general, tho&s;e deputies, <HI>annually cho&s;en
by every male of a &s;tated age, are &s;ubject to be controuled in
their votes by written orders from their con&s;tituents,</HI> yet they
frequently contrive to elude this re&s;triction. Sometimes the
in&s;tructions are drawn up, with the con&s;ent of the com|munity,
under the &s;ole direction of the deputy him&s;elf; at
other times an exemption from po&s;itive in&s;tructions, and
the power of voting at his own plea&s;ure, is purcha&s;ed by the
deputy from his con&s;tituents. Sometimes again the deputy,
although he may not have intere&s;t &s;ufficient to gain either of
the&s;e points, has &s;till &s;ufficient addre&s;s to get his in&s;tructions
&s;o ob&s;curely worded as to admit a doubtful interpretation.
By various intrigues of this kind the greate&s;t part of the de|puties
ultimately acquire the power of voting as they plea&s;e;
and as they chiefly obtain this power by corrupting their
con&s;tituents, mo&s;t of them in return &s;ell their vote to the
leading members of the diet. For mo&s;t que&s;tions are carried,
and mo&s;t cau&s;es decided by bribery. Nor can it well be
otherwi&s;e, when the electors are per&s;ons in needy circum|&s;tances;
and the members, who have purcha&s;ed their &s;eats,
are not them&s;elves exalted by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions above
temptation.</P>
<P>THUS then the leading members &s;ecure an unbounded
&s;way in the affairs of the diet. But &s;till it &s;hould &s;eem, that
whatever influence they may obtain by corrupting the de|puties;
<PB N="353" REF="367">
yet as that a&s;&s;embly it&s;elf does not in many ca&s;es de|cide
finally, they could not acquire the &s;ame authority in
tho&s;e concerns, which mu&s;t be referred to the determination
of the communities at large. Here at lea&s;t we might expect
the unbia&s;&s;ed &s;en&s;e of the majority of the people. But it
may be univer&s;ally remarked, that the delegation of delibe|rative
authority to the people at large unavoidably tends to
introduce an actual, though not an acknowledged ari&s;to|cracy.
For a <HI>numerous</HI> populace &s;ummoned to determine
upon political, legi&s;lative, and judicial que&s;tions, <HI>far above
their comprehen&s;ions,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ign them&s;elves to the
direction of more informed men, e&s;pecially when aided by the
recommendation of &s;uperior wealth. As the deputies are ge|nerally
the chiefs of tho&s;e communities which they repre&s;ent,
they mu&s;t of cour&s;e have the principal influence, and ea&s;ily
find means to incline the opinion of the people to the &s;ide
which they have e&s;pou&s;ed. In fact, without this ari&s;tocra|tical
influence, the exce&s;s of freedom would often dege|nerate
into anarchy, and public deliberations would be at|tended
with endle&s;s di&s;putes and factions.</P>
<P>IF therefore corruption and ari&s;tocratical influence alone
dimini&s;h factions and prevent anarchy in &s;o poor a country
as that of the Gri&s;ons, and in a republic &s;carcely known
among the nations of Europe; to what a dreadful exce&s;s
mu&s;t the &s;ame evils prevail, if the <HI>&s;ame</HI> mode of electing,
and giving in&s;tructions to, members of parliament, &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
in a kingdom like England; where riches and luxury
are continually advancing with &s;uch rapid &s;trides; where
the mo&s;t important political and commercial debates are
<PB N="354" REF="368">
agitated without re&s;traint; and where the deci&s;ions of pub|lic
affairs frequently affect the peace and intere&s;ts of all Eu|rope!
Theoretical rea&s;oners may, indeed, attempt to prove
that the be&s;t method of preventing corruption is to augment
the number of electors, from the chimerical idea, that <HI>large
numbers</HI> cannot be bribed. But if we appeal from uncertain
theory to more certain experience, we &s;hall find, that this
argument is contradicted by the hi&s;tory of all ages. Among
the Grecian republics, tho&s;e commonwealths in which the
magi&s;trates were cho&s;en by the <HI>people at large,</HI> were the
mo&s;t venal. Among the Romans, the mo&s;t effectual means
which Julius Cae&s;ar, the mo&s;t able politician of his age, em|ployed
to &s;ubjugate his country, was to extend the privileges
and votes of Roman citizens to <HI>all</HI> the inhabitants of Italy.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VALLEY OF SOPRA SELVA&mdash;ILANTS&mdash;TRUNS&mdash;DISENTIS&mdash;TAVETCH.</HEAD>
<P>IMPATIENT to return to England, after &s;o long an ab|&s;ence
from my friends, I ye&s;terday morning quitted
Coire, and pa&s;&s;ed by Embs, and over the bridge of Reiche|nau,
which I again &s;topped to admire, as it boldly projected
over the Rhine. I then rode along the &s;ide of the moun|tains
which &s;eparate the Gri&s;ons from the canton of Glarus,
went through Tamins, and left Flims on my right, &s;ituated
about a quarter of a mile from the road, in a plea&s;ant plain.
The hou&s;es of the&s;e towns are not &s;cattered like tho&s;e of
Davos, but &s;tand in &s;eparate clu&s;ters, like the burghs of En|gadina.
Having traver&s;ed thick fore&s;ts of pines, and a
very wild country, richly diver&s;ified with grain and pa&s;|ture,
I de&s;cended to the deep bed of the Rhine, and cro&s;&s;ed
it to Ilants.</P>
<P>ILANTS, the capital of the Grey League, is a &s;mall town,
containing about &s;ixty hou&s;es, and partly &s;urrounded by walls;
a circum&s;tance which &s;erves to di&s;tingui&s;h it, as it is the
only walled town, excepting Coire, among the Gri&s;ons. It
is al&s;o remarkable for being the place, where the general
diet of the three leagues a&s;&s;embles every third year. The
adjacent country is fertile in every &s;pecies of grain and pa&s;|ture.
The points of view are uncommonly fine, exhibiting
<PB N="356" REF="370">
a &s;mall plain &s;kirted by cultivated mountains, and backed by
a ridge of barren rocks which bound the valley of Lungnets.
The Roman&s;h, which is &s;poken in the&s;e parts, differs con&s;i|derably,
both as to pronunciation and orthography, from
that of Engadina. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome per&s;ons to
whom I had letters of recommendation, I procured &s;everal
books written in the dialect of this league; the&s;e, in addition
to others which I obtained in Engadina, have &s;o con&s;iderably
&s;welled my travelling library, that if I continue to increa&s;e
the collection, I mu&s;t hire an additional hor&s;e for the pur|po&s;e
of carrying my baggage of information.</P>
<P>THIS tract of country, &s;tretching from Reichenau to the
mountain of St. Gothard, is called the valley of Sopra Selva,
and is the mo&s;t populous part of the Grey League. On
quitting Ilants I pur&s;ued my route at the foot of the moun|tains,
through a plain covered with pa&s;ture and fore&s;t by the
&s;ide of the Rhine, which is rapid and &s;hallow. Afterwards I
pa&s;&s;ed through a rocky country, continually a&s;cending and
de&s;cending through large tracts of fore&s;t. I cro&s;&s;ed the
Rhine &s;everal times during the la&s;t four or five miles: that
river formed repeated cataracts, as I judged from the roaring
&s;ound, for the evening was &s;o dark, that no objects could be
di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>I ARRIVED very late at Truns, remarkable in the hi&s;tory
of this country as the place where the independence of the
league was fir&s;t ratified, and an alliance concluded between
the chiefs and the communities. I ob&s;erved an aged oak,
which, according to tradition, is the &s;ame tree under which
<PB N="357" REF="371">
the three chiefs confirmed the liberties of the league; and
near it a chapel, who&s;e walls are painted with a repre&s;entation
of the ceremony. My curio&s;ity led me to the town-hou&s;e, in
which the diet of the Grey League is annually a&s;&s;embled.
The room is well adopted for the purpo&s;e, and is hand|fomely
painted with the arms of the &s;everal Landrichters,
beginning from tho&s;e of John of Lambris, the fir&s;t per&s;on
appointed to that office when the Grey League was formed.
From this place of its meeting the a&s;&s;embly is always called
the Diet of Truns. It con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ame twenty-&s;even de|puties
who are appointed for the general diet of the three
leagues, the two Landrichters, the abbot of Di&s;entis, the re|pre&s;entative
of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, as baron of Retzuns,
and the Cau de Sax. All affairs relating to legi&s;lation, po|litics,
and expenditure, which concern the general intere&s;t of
the league, are agitated in this a&s;&s;embly; and the que&s;tions
are decided by the majority of voices. At the &s;ame place is
al&s;o a&s;&s;embled a court of appeal compo&s;ed of &s;ixteen<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e deputies are taken from the eight High Juri&s;dictions of the Grey League, in the following proportions:

<P>DISENTIS, from whence I am now writing, takes its ap|pellation
from an abbey of that name, who&s;e abbot was
formerly &s;overeign over this part of the Grey League, and
who, although his prerogatives have been gradually dimi|ni&s;hed,
yet, as one of the chiefs of the league, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
no incon&s;iderable influence in the general admini&s;tration of
affairs. At the diet of Truns he not only votes, but has &s;uch
weight, that few acts can pa&s;s in oppo&s;ition to his will. In
the court of appeal, although he is not pre&s;ent, he may be
&s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s four votes, as the four deputies from the High
Juri&s;diction of Di&s;entis are generally nominated through
his intere&s;t. Nor is his a&s;cendancy confined to the Grey
League; by the nomination of the Landrichter every third

and has al&s;o much power in the general diet of the Gri&s;ons
by his influence over the deputies of the Grey League. His
pre&s;ent revenue is very &s;mall, &s;carcely amounting to &pound;. 100
<HI>per ann.;</HI> in addition he receives a pen&s;ion from the Hou&s;e
of Au&s;tria, intere&s;ted to &s;ecure his concurrence. He is
cho&s;en by the Benedictine monks, who compo&s;e the chap|ter;
and is a prince of the German empire.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="373">
THE abbey, which is &s;ituated upon the &s;ide of the moun|tain,
is a large quadrangular building, and makes a magnifi|cent
apearance, as it overlooks the village. I was much di&s;|appointed
at the ab&s;ence of the abbot, whom I had the plea|&s;ure
of meeting at Coire: he is a man of con&s;iderable infor|mation,
and had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the key of the archives,
which are &s;aid to contain &s;everal curious records of high an|tiquity.
The monks who politely accompanied me over the
abbey were able to give me but little intelligence. Be&s;ides
the great church, they carried me to a &s;mall chapel, which is
e&s;teemed the mo&s;t antient in the whole country of the Gri|&s;ons.
Having been previou&s;ly informed, that books in the
Roman&s;h tongue, for the u&s;e of the Roman Catholics, are
frequently printed in this abbey, I procured &s;everal from
the monks, particularly a vocabulary of the Roman&s;h &s;poken
in the valley of Sopra Selva.</P>
<P>DISENTIS is a &s;traggling village lying upon a gentle de|clivity,
which &s;lopes gradually from the foot of the moun|tains
to the banks of the Rhine. The &s;ides of the mountains
are clothed with groves of firs and &s;mall birch; the lower
parts yield rich pa&s;ture, a &s;mall quantity of wheat, rye, and
millet. Oppo&s;ite Di&s;entis is the valley of Medels, from
which de&s;cends a torrent called the Middle Rhine, and joins
the upper branch that flows from the chain of the St. Go|thard.
The communities of Di&s;entis and Tavetch, which
form a High Juri&s;diction, occupy the we&s;tern extremity of
the valley of Sopra-Selva, &s;tretching as far as the con&s;ines of
Uri. The whole body of people a&s;&s;emble every two years at
Di&s;entis in the open air, for the choice of the Landamman,
<PB N="360" REF="374">
and for the confirmation of their magi&s;trates, as well as for
the purpo&s;e of enacting laws. They nominate al&s;o to the
governments of the &s;ubject provinces. The courts of judica|ture
are e&s;tabli&s;hed at Di&s;entis; and the judges are cho&s;en
by the people in the &s;eparate di&s;tricts. The general admini|&s;tration
of affairs is entru&s;ted to a council of &s;ixteen, which
gives in&s;tructions to their deputies, &s;ent by the two commu|nities
to the general diet of the three leagues. The Land|amman
is pre&s;ident, and has the ca&s;ting voice. The abbot
enjoys the privilege of being pre&s;ent at all political que&s;|tions,
and of giving his vote. He has con&s;iderable influence
in the&s;e communities. Formerly the fines for criminal of|fences
belonged to him; but one of his predece&s;&s;ors
having di&s;po&s;ed of that right to the community, they are
now divided among the judges.</P>
<P>September 30th.</P>
<P>I QUITTED Di&s;entis this morning, and in about two
hours entered the plea&s;ant valley of Tavetch, lying at the
foot of the Alps, which &s;eparate the Gri&s;ons from the canton
of Uri. The villages of this valley are numerous, and con|&s;i&s;t
of &s;cattered cottages chiefly con&s;tructed of wood, and re|&s;embling
the Swi&s;s hamlets in the &s;mall cantons. I met
many large herds of cattle ju&s;t de&s;cended from the higher
Alps, and driving towards the fairs of Tirano and Lugano.</P>
<P>THE valley of Tavetch produces pa&s;ture, hemp, and flax,
and a &s;mall quantity of rye and barley. The trees growing
in the&s;e parts are chiefly &s;irs and pines, and their number
gradually dimini&s;hes towards the extremity of the vale.
<PB N="361" REF="375">
From Tavetch I a&s;cended a very narrow path, and pa&s;&s;ed
through Selva and Cimut, the la&s;t village in the country of
the Gri&s;ons, where I took my farewel of the Roman&s;h. The
country became more and more wild as I a&s;cended; and
the Upper Rhine gradually dimini&s;hed as I approached its
&s;ource. A little beyond Cimut I came into a &s;mall plain of
pa&s;ture, watered by two &s;treams which unite and form the
Upper Rhine. I had once intended to have vi&s;ited the
&s;ource of the principal &s;tream, that precipitates from mount
Badus; but finding, upon inquiry from the inhabitants of
Selva, that it would employ at lea&s;t five hours in going and
returning; as the day was far advanced, and as my late
illne&s;s has di&s;qualified me for &s;uch fatiguing journeys, I
thought it mo&s;t prudent to pur&s;ue my route to Ur&s;eren.
At Cimut, a pea&s;ant, who had frequently vi&s;ited the &s;pot,
informed me, that the chief &s;ource of the Rhine de&s;cends
from a glacier upon the &s;ummit of the Badus; and forms a
piece of water about half a mile in circumference, called the
lake of St. Thomas. From this lake i&s;&s;ues a torrent, which
precipitates it&s;elf from the mountain, and being joined by
many &s;prings and currents forms the large&s;t of the two
&s;treams, which unite in the above-mentioned plain of pa&s;ture.
On quitting this plain I a&s;cended by the &s;ide of the &s;maller
&s;tream, until I traced it falling from a glacier clo&s;e to the
confines of the canton of Uri. The a&s;cent, though abrupt
and craggy, was not &s;o difficult as the pa&s;&s;age of the Braglio
or the Muret. The&s;e Alps produce no trees, but are covered
to a great height with herbage.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="376">
AFTER two hours continued a&s;cent from the valley of
Tavetch, I reached the highe&s;t point of the chain, which
&s;eparates the country of the Uri: a few paces further I pa&s;&s;ed
a po&s;t without any in&s;cription, which marks the boundary
between the two re&s;pective territories. Soon afterwards I
arrived at a lake of an oblong &s;hape, about a mile and a half
in circumference. It is formed principally by a torrent that
falls from the northern &s;ide of the &s;ame chain, which gives
ri&s;e to the Rhine: the lake &s;upplies a &s;tream that may be
called one of the &s;ources of the Reu&s;s. I followed it as it
runs through a narrow plain until I came to a &s;teep de&s;cent,
where the beautiful valley of Ur&s;eren &s;uddenly bur&s;t upon
my view.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 87.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GENERAL IDEA OF THE COURTS OF JUSTICE&mdash;RELIGION&mdash;REVENUES&mdash;POPULATION.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of my corre&s;pondence I have oc|ca&s;ionally
mentioned the judicial proceedings in &s;ome
of the communities. I &s;hall here remark in general, that
throughout the three leagues the Roman law prevails, modi|fied
by the municipal cu&s;toms. The courts of ju&s;tice in each
community are compo&s;ed of the chief magi&s;trate, who pre|&s;ides,
and a certain number of jurymen cho&s;en by the people:
they have no regular &s;alaries, but receive for their attend|ance
a &s;mall &s;um, ari&s;ing in &s;ome communities from the ex|pences
of the proce&s;s, which are defrayed by the criminals,
in others from a &s;hare of the fines. They enjoy the power
of pardoning or dimini&s;hing the penalty, and of receiving a
compo&s;ition in money. This mode of proceeding &s;uppo&s;es,
what is as ab&s;urd in theory as it is contrary to experience,
that judges will incline to mercy when it is their <HI>intere&s;t</HI> to
convict; or will impartially inflict puni&s;hment, even when
injurious to their own private advantage. The pri&s;oners are
examined in private; frequently tortured, for the purpo&s;e of
forcing confe&s;&s;ion, when the judges either divide the &s;ines,
or remit the puni&s;hment for a compo&s;ition. In &s;ome
di&s;tricts a criminal pro&s;ecution is a kind of fe&s;tival to the
<PB N="364" REF="378">
judges, for whom a good repa&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A &s;pecifie &s;um is allowed for the expence of the dinner, amounting in general to about 48 florins.</NOTE> is provided at the expence
of the pri&s;oner if convicted; and thus the allu&s;ion, in Garth's
Di&s;pen&s;ary, applied with more wit than truth to our courts
of ju&s;tice, is literally fulfilled:
<Q>&startq;And wretches hang, that jurymen may <HI>DINE.</HI>&endq;</Q>
Capital puni&s;hments, however, are extremely rare; a cir|cum&s;tance
ari&s;ing not from any peculiar lenity in the penal
&s;tatutes, or from a propen&s;ity to mercy in the judges; but
becau&s;e the judges draw more advantages from fining
than executing an offender. In a word, to u&s;e the ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of Burnet, which is no le&s;s true at pre&s;ent than it
was in his time, &startq;Many crimes go unpuni&s;hed, if the
per&s;ons who commit them have either great credit or
much money.&endq;</P>
<P>IT is remarkable that torture is more frequently applied,
and for &s;maller delinquencies, in the&s;e independent republics,
than in the &s;ubject provinces. The infliction of it depends
entirely upon the arbitrary will of the judges, a majority of
whom may order it to obtain the confe&s;&s;ion of an offence
which is not capital, nor even puni&s;hable by corporal penal|ties.
Thus it is not uncommon, in tho&s;e communities
where fines are divided among the judges, to torture women
of loo&s;e conduct, for the purpo&s;e of compelling them to
confe&s;s with whom they have been connected; for as in|continence

convicted, the larger &s;hare of money is di&s;tributed among
the judges. Even in the di&s;tricts, where the fines are paid
to the community, torture is often no le&s;s wantonly in|flicted,
becau&s;e when the pri&s;oner is not found guilty, the
expences of the proce&s;s fall upon the public, and the judges
receive le&s;s emolument.</P>
<P>EVEN in the civil courts mo&s;t cau&s;es are decided by brib|ing
the judges; and appeals in tho&s;e communities, wherein
they are admitted, &s;carcely &s;erve any other end than to en|large
the &s;phere of corruption: Coire and a few other
places are excepted from this general reflection. This de|&s;cription
comprehends the cour&s;e of juri&s;prudence through|out
the Gri&s;ons; and how can it be expected, that the gover|nors
of the &s;ubject provinces &s;hould impartially admini&s;ter
ju&s;tice, when their power is enlarged, and they enjoy greater
means of enriching them&s;elves; &s;ince they have &s;uch continual

con&s;ent of the general diet; and which, during its &s;ittings,
had juri&s;diction over the three leagues. It was chiefly held
in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on, and is thus ju&s;tly de&s;cribed by Bur|net,
&startq;There is a part of this con&s;titution that is very ter|rible,
and which makes the greate&s;t men in it tremble:
the pea&s;ants come &s;ometimes in great bodies, and demand
a chamber of ju&s;tice from the general diet, and they are
bound to grant it always when it is thus demanded, which
comes about generally once in twenty years; commonly this
tumult of the pea&s;ants is &s;et on by &s;ome of the mal-con|tented
gentry, and generally there are a great many &s;a|crifices
made. This court is compo&s;ed of ten judges out
of every league, and twenty advocates, who manage
&s;uch accu&s;ations as are pre&s;ented to them; this court is
paramount to law, and acts like a court of inqui&s;ition,
they give the que&s;tion, and do every thing that they think
nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover the truth of &s;uch accu&s;ations as are
pre&s;ented to them; and the deci&s;ions of this court can
never be brought under a &s;econd review; though there is
an exception to this, for about a hundred years ago one
court of ju&s;tice rever&s;ed all that another had done; but
that is a &s;ingle in&s;tance.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE meetings, very u&s;ual in the la&s;t century, were al|ways
attended with &s;uch dreadful effects as nearly to en|danger
<PB N="367" REF="381">
the ruin of the republic. The pre&s;ent generation,
grown wi&s;er by experience, and either aware of the dreadful
effects of &s;uch licentious proceedings, or le&s;s agitated with
inte&s;tine di&s;&s;en&s;ions, have never had recour&s;e to the&s;e &s;an|guinary
mea&s;ures: accordingly the&s;e courts are now &s;o to|tally
fallen into di&s;u&s;e, that they may be con&s;idered as
ob&s;olete, although they have never been aboli&s;hed by public
authority.</P>
<P>THE religion of the Gri&s;ons is divided into Catholic and
Reformed, the only two per&s;ua&s;ions which are tolerated in
this country. By the reformed is meant what we call Cal|vini&s;m,
although it is not the &s;ame as was e&s;tabli&s;hed at
Geneva. For as the reformation was introduced into this
country by the di&s;ciples of Zuingle, the religion of the Pro|te&s;tant
Gri&s;ons bears a greater re&s;emblance to that &s;ettled at
Zuric, than to the church of Geneva; although the differ|ence
between the&s;e two &s;ects is &s;o trifling, that they may be
con&s;idered as holding the &s;ame tenets. Among the Gri&s;ons
the Prote&s;tants are more numerous than the Catholics, the
former being e&s;timated at about two-thirds of the inha|bitants;
and Stanyan ju&s;tly a&s;&s;erts<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">State of Switzerland. p. 228.</NOTE>, that &startq;as all their
elections are decided by the plurality of voices, the repub|lic
of the Gri&s;ons may be deemed a Prote&s;tant &s;tate.&endq;</P>
<P>THE reformation was introduced very early into this
country: the new doctrines were fir&s;t preached about the
<PB N="368" REF="382">
year 1524, and received at Flae&s;ch, a &s;mall village in the Ten
Juri&s;dictions, upon the confines of Sargans; from thence
they were extended to Mayenfield and Malantz, and &s;oon
afterwards through the whole valley of Pretigau. The
reformed opinions &s;pread with &s;uch celerity, that before the
end of the &s;ixteenth century they were embraced by the
whole league of the Ten Juri&s;dictions, (excepting part of
the community of Alvenew), the greate&s;t part of the Hou&s;e
of God, and a few communities in the Grey League.</P>
<P>THE difference of religion nearly excited a civil war be|tween
the two &s;ects, as well at the fir&s;t introduction of the
reformation, as at the beginning of the troubles in the Val|teline.
In the latter in&s;tance the two parties ro&s;e in arms,
but the Catholics being overpowered by the Prote&s;tants, mat|ters
were amicably adju&s;ted. Since that period, all religious
concerns have been regulated with perfect cordiality. Ac|cording
to the general con&s;ent of the three leagues, each
community, being ab&s;olute within its little territory, has the
power of appointing its own particular wor&s;hip, and the in|habitants
are free to follow either the Catholic or Reformed
per&s;ua&s;ion. In the admini&s;tration of civil affairs religion
has no interference: the deputies of the general diet may
be members of either communion, as cho&s;en by the commu|nities
which they repre&s;ent. By this moderate and tolerating
principle, all religious di&s;&s;entions have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed as
much as po&s;&s;ible; and the mo&s;t perfect amity &s;ub&s;i&s;ts
between the two &s;ects.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="383">
IN &s;piritual concerns the Catholics for the mo&s;t part are un|der
the juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hop of Coire. For the affairs
of the Reformed churches, each league is divided into a
certain number of di&s;tricts, the mini&s;ters whereof a&s;&s;emble
twice every year: the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies are called <HI>colloquia.</HI>
Each <HI>colloquium</HI> has its pre&s;ident, and each league a &s;uperin|tendent,
called a dean. The &s;upreme authority in &s;piritual
concerns is ve&s;ted in the &s;ynod, which is compo&s;ed of the
three deans, and the clergy of each league: the &s;ynod
a&s;&s;embles every year reciprocally in each of the three
leagues. Candidates for holy orders are examined before
the &s;ynod. The nece&s;&s;ary qualification for admi&s;&s;ion into
the church ought to be the knowledge of Hebrew, Greek,
and Latin: but this rule is not &s;trictly adhered to; many
being ordained without the lea&s;t acquaintance with either of
tho&s;e languages. Formerly Latin was &s;olely u&s;ed, as well in
the debates of the &s;ynod as for the purpo&s;e of examining the
candidates; but at pre&s;ent that tongue grows more and more
into di&s;u&s;e, and German is employed in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>THE number of reformed pari&s;hes in the whole three
Leagues amount to 135, in the following proportion. In the
Grey League 46, in that of God's Hou&s;e 53, and in the League
of Ten Juri&s;dictions 36. The mini&s;ters of the&s;e churches
enjoy but very &s;mall &s;alaries. The riche&s;t benefices do not
perhaps yield more than &pound;. 20, or at mo&s;t &pound;. 25 <HI>per ann.</HI> and
the poore&s;t &s;ometimes &s;carcely &pound;. 6. This &s;canty income is
attended with many inconveniences. It obliges the clergy,
who have families, to follow &s;ome branch of tra&s;&s;ic, to the
neglect of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tudies, and to the degradation
<PB N="370" REF="384">
of the profe&s;&s;ional character. Another inconvenience is
&s;uperadded to the narrowne&s;s of their income. In mo&s;t
communities the mini&s;ters, though confirmed by the &s;ynod,
are cho&s;en by the people of the pari&s;h, and are &s;olely
dependent on their bounty. For the&s;e rea&s;ons the candidates
for holy orders are generally extremely ignorant. They can|not
&s;upport that expence which is requi&s;ite to pur&s;ue their
&s;tudies; they are not animated with the expectation of a
decent competence; and, from the dependent mode of their
election, are not encouraged to de&s;erve their promotion by a
con&s;i&s;tent dignity of character. But there are not wanting a
few men of great knowledge and eminence, as well in their
profe&s;&s;ional &s;tudies as in other branches of polite learning.
Be&s;ide Mr. Aporta, whom I look up to as a kind of phaeno|menon
in the literary world, I have met with two or three
clergymen who are greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed for their erudition,
and who would do credit to any church.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that the liturgies of the&s;e Reformed
churches are not exactly the &s;ame; a diver&s;ity owing to
the independence of &s;o many &s;mall commonwealths, which
are ab&s;olute, within their little territories, in all concerns that
do not affect the political union of the three Leagues. The
churches of the German communities u&s;e the liturgy of
Zuric; but as this form of prayer was amended and refined
in 1766, &s;ome of the mini&s;ters admit the new, and others
&s;till retain the antient liturgy.</P>

<P>THE revenues of the three Leagues ari&s;e from the fol|lowing
articles: 1. The duties upon the merchandi&s;e which
pa&s;&s;es through the Gri&s;ons, the Valteline, and Chiavenna:
they are farmed at the annual rate of 17, 000 florins, or about
&pound;. 1259. 2. A third of the fines laid upon delinquents in
the &s;ubject countries: the fluctuating &s;tate of this article
cannot be a&s;certained. 3. A tribute of 500 philips<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">A philip = $<HI>s.</HI></NOTE> from
the Valteline, and 100 from Chiavenna. 4. A &s;mall fund,
<PB N="372" REF="386">
the principal part of which is only &pound;. 4, 000, ve&s;ted in the
Engli&s;h &s;tocks. The public expenditure is very trifling,
being chiefly confined to the expences incurred by the
&s;ittings of the diet, and the &s;alary a&s;&s;igned to the deputies for
their attendance. Be&s;ides this public trea&s;ury, each League
has its own fund. The pen&s;ions received from the foreign
powers are paid annually at the meeting of the diet, when
they are equally divided between the three Leagues; and
each deputy delivers the &s;hare to the community which
he repre&s;ents.</P>
<P>MANY di&s;putes have occa&s;ionally ari&s;en among the
Gri&s;ons in regard to the power of coining, and &s;everal of the
communities have a&s;&s;erted their claim to the exerci&s;e of that
right. The fact is, that each community might doubtle&s;s
coin money, and order it to be taken within its own little
territory; but as it could not make it pa&s;s in the other parts,
the right is merely nominal. According to the general con|&s;ent
of the three Leagues, this privilege is ve&s;ted in the town
of Coire, in the bi&s;hop of that dioce&s;e, and in the baron of
Halden&s;tein<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">And I believe in the abbot of Di&s;entis.</NOTE>. No money is, however, &s;truck in the Gri|&s;ons,
excepting a &s;mall copper coin called blut&s;ger, which is
&s;omewhat le&s;s than a halfpenny. The gold and &s;ilver cur|rent

<P>I HAVE be&s;towed no incon&s;iderable degree of pains in

<HEAD>LETTER 88.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">COMMERCE OF THE GRISONS&mdash;CANAL OF THE
ADDA.</HEAD>
<P>THE commerce of the Gri&s;ons is extremely contracted.
The only exports (exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e from the &s;ubject
provinces) being chee&s;e and cattle. They import grain, rice,
&s;alt, and &s;ilk &s;tuffs, from Milan; grain from Suabia and
Tyrol; &s;alt from Tyrol and Bavaria; fine cloth, chiefly Eng|li&s;h,
French, and Sile&s;ian, through Germany; fine linen
and mu&s;lins from Switzerland: and as the only manufacture
throughout the whole country is that of cotton e&s;tabli&s;hed at
Coire, it is evident that the balance of trade mu&s;t turn con|&s;iderably
again&s;t them. They are enabled to &s;upport this
difference by means of the e&s;tates which the Gri&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;s
in the &s;ubject provinces, by the &s;ums which the governors
draw from tho&s;e provinces, by public and private pen&s;ions
from France and Au&s;tria, by money &s;aved in foreign &s;er|vices,
and by the duties upon the merchandi&s;e pa&s;&s;ing
through their territories.</P>
<P>As mo&s;t of the Gri&s;on pea&s;ants weave cloth and linen for
the u&s;e of their families; it would be no difficult under|taking
to introduce manufactures in different di&s;tricts. But
it is remarkable, that in the&s;e little republics a &s;trange pre|judice
prevails again&s;t commerce; and that the project of
e&s;tabli&s;hing manufactures is oppo&s;ed by many leading men
<PB N="375" REF="389">
of the country. It is difficult to di&s;cover the occa&s;ion of
the&s;e illiberal principles; it has been imputed to a &s;u&s;picion,
that if the people &s;hould become opulent by commerce,
they would be le&s;s open to influence; and the powerful fa|milies,
who now direct the public affairs, would lo&s;e their
a&s;cendancy. Be&s;ides the&s;e rea&s;ons, which are of too delicate
a nature to be openly acknowledged, other motives of a more
generous complexion have been a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>THE advocates again&s;t extending commerce a&s;&s;ert, that as
the true riches of every country con&s;i&s;t in the products of
agriculture, all occupations, which turn the attention of the
people from that one great object, are detrimental to the
general good of &s;ociety; and particularly, that in free &s;tates
manufactures tend to enervate the inhabitants, to introduce
the baneful effects of luxury, to depre&s;s the &s;pirit of free|dom,
and to de&s;troy the general &s;implicity of manners.
The&s;e arguments, however &s;pecious in appearance, will
prove fallacious upon mature con&s;ideration. If in a country,
which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts chiefly by agriculture, manufactures are pur|&s;ued
to the total neglect of hu&s;bandry, they then become de|trimental:
but this is &s;eldom the ca&s;e; as, by adding to the
general con&s;umption, manufactures u&s;ually tend to increa&s;e,
in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, the products of the earth. Such have
been the effects in the mountains of Neuchatel, where the
fore&s;ts have been cleared, and the country converted into
pa&s;ture, or &s;own with grain. Manufactures and commerce
are &s;till farther &s;erviceable by encouraging an increa&s;e of
inhabitants, which form the true riches of a country. For
whenever con&s;tant opportunities of employing a number of
<PB N="376" REF="390">
hands occur, children will not be a burden to the pea&s;ants,
the contrary of which mu&s;t happen in tho&s;e di&s;tricts which
afford little occupation.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the Gri&s;ons in particular; their terri|tory
being entirely mountainous will not yield &s;ufficient
produce for the inhabitants, con&s;equently &s;ome means of
&s;upplying the deficiency mu&s;t be adopted. Now &s;urely it
would be far more honourable to pur&s;ue commerce, even if
attended with &s;ome unavoidable inconveniences, than to
depend for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence upon foreign &s;ub&s;idies, to op|pre&s;s
and exhau&s;t the &s;ubject provinces, and to exhibit a re|gular
&s;y&s;tem of venality, which almo&s;t pervades the whole
ma&s;s of people. Nor does the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactures
tend to enervate the inhabitants, and to dimini&s;h the &s;pirit of
freedom. In fact, the manufactures in the&s;e democratical
&s;tates are by no means &s;imilar to tho&s;e introduced into large
towns, where a number of individuals are collected in the
&s;ame &s;pot: on the contrary, the work is divided, and di&s;tri|buted
among the pea&s;ants, who, with their wives and chil|dren,
weave the cloth at home. By this method they pre|&s;erve
(as I had occa&s;ion to remark in the canton of Ap|penzel)
their original &s;implicity of manners, and maintain
the &s;pirit of freedom, even to a greater degree, than in
tho&s;e parts where there is no commerce. Examples are not
wanting among the Gri&s;ons them&s;elves: the natives of
Upper Engadina, who are &s;o much inclined to trade, are in
reality more free and le&s;s influenced than the people of the
other communities; nor is it ob&s;erved, that the inhabitants
of the valley of Pretigau have become more enervated, &s;ince
<PB N="377" REF="391">
they have been employed in preparing cotton for the manu|facture
at Coire. In fact, that kind of occupation does not
always take the pea&s;ants from more active employments.
In &s;ummer they are at lei&s;ure to cultivate the earth, while
their wives and children attend principally to the manu|factures:
during the long winters, which la&s;t in the&s;e Al|pine
regions for &s;ix months without intermi&s;&s;ion, agricul|ture
is nece&s;&s;arily &s;u&s;pended; and the&s;e occupations &s;ucceed
the more laborious exertions of the field.</P>
<P>As the principal commerce of the Gri&s;ons and the &s;ubject
provinces is carried on acro&s;s the lake of Como with Milan, I
&s;hall give you an account of the inland navigation, which
has been lately e&s;tabli&s;hed for the purpo&s;e of facilitating that
commerce; the &s;everal parts of which I had the curio&s;ity to
vi&s;it. The water communication between the country of the
Gri&s;ons and Milan is formed by the lake of Como, by its
branch the lake of Lecco, by the Adda, by the canals of the
Adda and Trezzo. The canal of Trezzo, called al&s;o <HI>Canale
della Marte&s;ana,</HI> begins at Trezzo, &s;ituated on the Adda,
and is carried to Milan. This cut, which is 24 miles in
length, begun in 1457, under the reign of Francis Sforza,
and completed in 1460, did not at fir&s;t &s;erve for the purpo&s;e
of navigation more than two days in the week; being prin|cipally
u&s;ed for overflowing the low grounds with water, ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for the cultivation of rice. In 1573, during the admi|ni&s;tration
of the duke of Aberquerque, Spani&s;h governor of
Milan, the cut was enlarged, and the body of water &s;o much
increa&s;ed, as to admit the pa&s;&s;age of ve&s;&s;els every day.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="392">
STILL, however, the Adda was not navigable during the
whole way between the lake of Lecco and Trezzo; and con|&s;equently
there was no water communication between the
lake of Como and Milan. The navigation of that river was
interrupted by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cataracts for about a mile,
during which &s;pace the fall of water is equal to the perpen|dicular
height of about 80 feet.</P>
<P>IN order to obviate this inconvenience, a canal was pro|jected,
in 1519, but no part was carried into execution, ex|cepting
a mole, which was thrown acro&s;s the Adda. In
1591 the work was undertaken, and the canal completed in
1599. But the &s;tream of the Adda was no &s;ooner admitted
into the cut, than the banks broke down, for &s;o con&s;iderable
a way, as to render all repairs impracticable. This breach,
generally imputed to the violence of the current, was princi|pally
owing to the nature of the rock, in which the cut was
excavated, and to an error in the original plan. The rock is
a compo&s;ition of gravel and &s;and, or a &s;pecies of pudding-&s;tone,
of loo&s;e texture and unequal &s;olidity; and as the cut
was made too near the precipice, which overhangs the Adda,
that part of the rock which formed the banks of the canal
was not &s;ufficiently &s;trong to &s;upport the &s;luices and the
weight of water. From that time the canal was con&s;idered
an impracticable work, and abandoned; until a few years
ago it was again undertaken by order of the emperor Jo&s;eph
the Second, and carried on with &s;uch expedition, as to be
fini&s;hed within the &s;pace of three years.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="393">
THE canal is about a mile in length, and is excavated in
the rocks, which form the precipitous banks of the Adda.
In &s;ome places the rock has been hollowed to the depth of
100 feet, and the breadth of 200. The fall of water, which is
equal to the perpendicular height of about 80 feet, is broken
by &s;ix &s;luices; and the water is &s;upplied by the running
&s;tream of the Adda. The breadth of the canal is 70 feet.
The expence has already amounted to near &pound;. 100, 000. The
engineers, however, &s;eem to have fallen into the &s;ame error
which attended the original plan; by forming the cut too
near the precipice. In con&s;equence of this inadvertence,
the water lately forced down the banks of the canal; and the
damage was not repaired without much difficulty and a con|&s;iderable
expence. Notwith&s;tanding the precaution of let|ting
out the &s;uperfluous water by flood-gates, there is rea&s;on
to apprehend, that the&s;e breaches will be frequent; and that
the recent labours may be rendered as ineffectual as tho&s;e of
the Spaniards. But &s;hould the canal continue in its pre&s;ent
&s;tate, and the navigation not be interrupted; yet the advan|tages
will hardly compen&s;ate for the expence of making and
keeping it in repair. The commerce between the Gri&s;ons
and inhabitants of Milan is &s;o extremely contracted, that if
all the merchandi&s;e which pa&s;&s;es between the&s;e two people
was conveyed along the canals, the tolls and duties would be
very inadequate to the expence.</P>
<P>BUT the navigation from the lake of Como to Milan
is attended with &s;o many difficulties, that the greate&s;t part of
the merchandi&s;e is &s;ent by land, as the mo&s;t commodious
and le&s;s hazardous way. The current of the Adda is &s;o
<PB N="380" REF="394">
rapid, that the ve&s;&s;els cannot be towed up without great ex|pence
and delay, and is in &s;ome parts &s;o extremely dange|rous,
that boats are not unfrequently over&s;et. The only
per&s;ons, therefore, who forward their merchandi&s;e along the
Adda and the canals to the lake of Lecco are the contractors,
who furni&s;h the Gri&s;ons with corn and &s;alt, and who are
compelled by the government of Milan to &s;end tho&s;e com|modities
by water. And when it is con&s;idered that Milan
receives from the Gri&s;ons only planks, &s;tones for building,
and coals, and &s;upplies them with corn, rice, and &s;alt; the ar|ticles
of export evidently exceed tho&s;e of import; and the
navigation from Milan to the lake of Como is of more
con&s;equence than that from the lake of Como to Milan.
The canal of the Adda, therefore, which has only facilitated
the inland navigation from the Gri&s;ons to Milan, and not
from Milan to the Gri&s;ons, though a work of extreme diffi|culty,
and redounding greatly to the honour of the &s;ove|reign
who completed it, will &s;carcely produce advantages
equal to its original co&s;t and frequent repairs<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The curious reader is referred to the Abbe Fri&s;i's account of the Canals of the Adda, and Trezzo, and of the other navigable canals in the Milane&s;e.

CANTONS&mdash;FRANCE&mdash;VENICE&mdash;AND THE HOUSE
OF AUSTRIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE alliances of the Gri&s;ons with foreign powers come
next under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>THE Three Leagues, though always e&s;teemed allies of
the Swi&s;s, yet are not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, in confederacy with
all the cantons. In 1497 the Grey League, and in the fol|lowing
year the League of God's Hou&s;e, entered into a per|petual
treaty with Zuric, Lucern, Uri, Schweitz, Under|walden,
Zug and Glaris. Although the League of Ten
Juri&s;dictions was not included in the &s;ame treaty, yet it was
afterwards declared that, in con&s;equence of its connection
with the other two leagues, it &s;hould be entitled to the &s;ame
a&s;&s;i&s;tance and good offices. The Three Leagues are in clo&s;e
alliance with Berne and Zuric, to who&s;e mediation they have
frequently had recour&s;e in points of di&s;agreement. By the&s;e
treaties the Gri&s;ons are called allies of the Swi&s;s; and, in
con&s;equence of a reque&s;t from the particular cantons, with
which they are united, would, in ca&s;e of inva&s;ion or rebellion,
be &s;upplied with &s;uccours from all the Swi&s;s Republics.</P>
<P>THE Gri&s;ons contracted the fir&s;t alliance with France in
1509 with Lewis the Twelfth, and in 1516 were compri&s;ed
<PB N="382" REF="396">
in the treaty of perpetual peace between Francis the Fir&s;t
and the Helvetic body. Since that period they have, as oc|ca&s;ion
offered, renewed their private confederacy with the
kings of France; but they were not comprehended in the late
treaty of Soleure, concluded between Louis the Sixteenth
and the other &s;tates of Switzerland. The king of France
maintains an envoy in this country, and has two Gri&s;on re|giments
in his &s;ervice<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is probable, however, that they have &s;ince contracted a &s;eparate treaty with France.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN 1707 a treaty was formed between the Gri&s;ons on the
one &s;ide, queen Anne and the United Provinces on the
other, for permitting the free pa&s;&s;age of troops marching
into Italy. This is the only alliance by which the Gri&s;ons,
as a particular &s;tate, are connected with England. Our court
formerly had a mini&s;ter in the country, but for &s;ome time
the Engli&s;h envoy to the Swi&s;s cantons re&s;ident at Berne, has
tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s with this republic.</P>
<P>THE Venetians, for the purpo&s;e of procuring the free
pa&s;&s;age of the Valteline, had often &s;olicited an alliance with
the Gri&s;ons; but their projects were always defeated by the
influence of the Spani&s;h monarch, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Mila|ne&s;e;
nor were they able to effectuate the accompli&s;hment
of their de&s;ign, until the Spani&s;h branch of the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria became extinct in the per&s;on of Charles the Second.
Soon after that event, when Milan was the object of conten|tion
between the emperor and the French, the Venetians
obtained the con&s;ent of the Gri&s;ons to enter into a treaty of
<PB N="383" REF="397">
alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, which was ratified at Coire
the 17th of December 1706. By this accommodation it was
&s;tipulated, among other articles on the &s;ide of the Venetians,
to pay an annual pen&s;ion of 711 Spani&s;h doubloons, and to
furni&s;h the Gri&s;ons in time of war with a thou&s;and Venetian
ducats per month: in return, the Gri&s;ons agreed to permit
the pa&s;&s;age of the Venetian troops through the Valteline,
and to make a road leading from Morbegno over the moun|tain
of St. Mark into the Venetian territories, by which ac|commodation
the merchandi&s;e might be conveyed to and
from Venice to Germany without going through the Tyrol.</P>
<P>THIS treaty, concluded for twenty years, was to continue
in force for the &s;ame additional period, unle&s;s one of the
contracting parties &s;hould withdraw before the expiration of
the fir&s;t term; but though obtained by the Venetians with
much trouble and expence, it was not long fulfilled by either
of the negociating powers. In a few years the Venetians
omitted payment of the annual pen&s;ion, and the Gri&s;ons
neglected to make the road over the mountain of St. Mark.
The two republics, however, continued upon terms of amity;
and the Venetians, &s;oon after the expiration of the forty
years, de&s;irous of renewing the treaty, offered to di&s;charge
the arrears of the pen&s;ion, if the Gri&s;ons would open the pro|po&s;ed
communication over the mountain of St. Mark. For
this purpo&s;e an envoy was di&s;patched to the Gri&s;ons in 1759,
and no promi&s;es were &s;pared to promote the negociation: it
failed, however, through the influence of the empre&s;s of
Germany. The Gri&s;ons rejected the propo&s;als of Venice,
and &s;till further alienated that republic by the capitulation of
<PB N="384" REF="398">
Milan. In con&s;equence of this conduct, the Venetians were
&s;o incen&s;ed as to bani&s;h the Gri&s;ons who were &s;ettled within
their territories; and all connection is now interrupted be|tween
the two republics.</P>
<P>THE treaties with the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, as &s;overeigns
of the Milane&s;e, remain to be con&s;idered. It is not my
purpo&s;e to mention any treaties which the Gri&s;ons con|tracted
with the dukes of Milan of the hou&s;e of Sforza,
or tho&s;e by which Philip the Second and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors ac|knowledged
their claim to the Valteline, Chiavenna, and
Bormio; but I &s;hall begin with the celebrated alliance, or,
as it is called, the <HI>Capitulation</HI> of Milan in 1639; becau&s;e it
&s;uper&s;eded all others, and e&s;tabli&s;hed that clo&s;e connection
between the Gri&s;ons and the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which has
&s;ince continued with little interruption.</P>
<P>THE following are the principal articles in this capitula|tion,
concluded between Philip the Fourth, king of Spain, as
duke of Milan, and the Three Leagues: An hereditary and
perpetual peace between the two contracting powers:
Weekly fairs to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the neighbouring towns of
the Milane&s;e, in which the Gri&s;ons may purcha&s;e grain, and
al&s;o enjoy a free trade, for the purpo&s;e of importing and ex|porting
all kinds of merchandi&s;e and arms, upon paying
only the accu&s;tomed duties: A free pa&s;&s;age through the ter|ritories
of the Gri&s;ons for the Spani&s;h troops, with a re&s;erve,
that no more than a company of 150 infantry, and a troop of
60 cavalry, &s;hall march through the &s;ame day: Free pa&s;|&s;age
of the Gri&s;on troops through the Milane&s;e, upon con|dition
<PB N="385" REF="399">
that they do not march again&s;t the allies of Spain,
and that more than two or three companies do not pa&s;s
at one time. The king may levy at his own expence, in
ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, a body of troops not exceeding 6000 nor
le&s;s than 2000, for his &s;ervice again&s;t all his enemies, except
the confederates of the Gri&s;ons, and particularly the republic
of Venice. All Gri&s;on troops in the &s;ervice of any &s;tate or
&s;overeign, intending to attack the territories of the king of
Spain &s;hall be immediately recalled; and all officers and &s;ol|diers,
who enroll them&s;elves in any foreign &s;ervice, &s;hall be
forbidden to invade his maje&s;ty's territories. Should the Gri|&s;ons
be engaged in war, the king obliges him&s;elf to furni&s;h,
within fifteen days, 2000 infantry and 200 cavalry; but if
they prefer a&s;&s;i&s;tance in money, to pay 1000 &s;cudi<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A Milane&s;e &s;cudo = to about 4 s. 6 d.</NOTE> per
month as long as the war la&s;ts; al&s;o to &s;end into the country
of Chiavenna &s;ix pieces of campaign artillery, with ammuni|tion
&s;ufficient for the &s;ervice of the war. No troops &s;hall be
allowed to pa&s;s through the re&s;pective territories to the
di&s;advantage of the two contracting parties. To each league
the king promi&s;es an annual pen&s;ion of 1500 &s;cudi; and al&s;o
to pay for the education of two &s;tudents from each league
at Pavia or Milan, be&s;ides a donation of &s;ixty &s;cudi to each
&s;tudent.</P>
<P>ALL ancient alliances with any other powers are permit|ted
to remain in force on both &s;ides, and on the part of the
Gri&s;ons, the continuance of their treaty with France is parti|cularly
&s;tipulated: they promi&s;e, however, that they will not
<PB N="386" REF="400">
renew it in ca&s;e of a rupture between the two crowns; and
if renewed, they will declare at the &s;ame time that it is to be
&s;u&s;pended during &s;uch a rupture, and that they will not for
the future contract an alliance with any foreign power to
the prejudice of this perpetual peace. Should either par|ties
be attacked, the other, without any regard to the &s;ti|pulations
in favour of their ancient allies, is bound to give
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, except however on his maje&s;ty's part, the German
branch of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; if that hou&s;e &s;hould engage
in war with the Gri&s;ons, for the maintenance of its rights in
the territory of the Gri&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es which gave ri&s;e to this capitulation, as well as
the articles re&s;pecting the Valteline, having been already
related<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Letter 75.</NOTE>; it will be nece&s;&s;ary only to remark, that the Spa|niards
guaranteed to the Gri&s;ons the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;ub|ject
provinces, and to the &s;ubjects the confirmation of their
privileges. In ca&s;e of any di&s;&s;ention between the Gri&s;ons
and their &s;ubjects, the di&s;pute is to be referred to the media|tion
of the king of Spain.</P>
<P>THIS treaty, &s;igned at Milan on the 3d of September 1639,
by the marquis de Legnes, governor of Milan, on the part of
the Spani&s;h king, and on the other by the deputies of the
Three Leagues, was pre&s;erved inviolate, and a good under|&s;tanding
maintained between the contracting powers, until
the extinction of the Spani&s;h branch of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria
in the per&s;on of Charles the Second. During the war of
<PB N="387" REF="401">
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which followed his death, the Milane&s;e
frequently changed its ma&s;ters, until it was &s;ecured to the
emperor Charles the Sixth by the peace of Utrecht. Charles
had no &s;ooner firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed his power in his new domi|nions,
than he turned his attention to the Gri&s;ons, and pre|vailed
upon them to renew the capitulation of Milan. One
of the principal arguments which gave &s;ucce&s;s to his nego|ciation,
was the promi&s;e, not only of continuing the annual
pen&s;ion, but even of di&s;charging the arrears, which
amounted to twenty-nine payments. This new treaty, in
which the German branch of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria &s;ucceeded
to the place of the Spani&s;h, was concluded on the 24th of
October 1726, by count Daun, governor of Milan, in the
name of Charles the Sixth, and the deputies of the Three
Leagues. It confirmed and ratified the ancient capitulation
of 1639, with a few modifications and additions, of which
the principal are the following. The duties upon corn pur|cha&s;ed
by the Gri&s;ons in the Milane&s;e are lowered two-thirds.
The tenth article in the fir&s;t treaty, by which all
Gri&s;on troops in the &s;ervice of any &s;tate de&s;igning to attack
the territories of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria are &s;ubject to
immediate recall, is annulled; and the Gri&s;ons are free to
&s;erve any foreign prince in time of war without incurring
the breach of this capitulation. The number of &s;tudents
educated at the expence of the emperor is increa&s;ed to
twelve. On the 8th of February 1763, this hereditary
league was renewed by count Firmian, mini&s;ter plenipoten|tiary,
in the name of the empre&s;s of Germany as &s;overeign
of Milan, and the deputies of the Three Leagues. By this
treaty the capitulations of 1639 and 1726 are rati&s;ied, and
<PB N="388" REF="402">
&s;erve as the ba&s;is of the pre&s;ent union; they are al&s;o aug|mented
by the following articles. The empre&s;s renounces all
right to the lake of Chiavenna, together with a &s;mall portion
of the adjacent territory, and cedes them in perpetuity to the
Gri&s;ons. The limits between the Milane&s;e and the territory
of the Gri&s;ons are accurately fixed. In return for this
ce&s;&s;ion, the Gri&s;ons agree to erect no fortifications upon the
ceded territory, impo&s;e no new taxes upon the tran&s;port of
merchandi&s;e, make no new roads; and, according to the
former capitulation, no troops &s;hall be permitted to pa&s;s to
the prejudice of the &s;tate of Milan. The empre&s;s promi&s;es
to obtain from the pope an abolition of &s;everal eccle&s;ia&s;tical
privileges in the Valteline, highly detrimental to &s;ociety;
al&s;o to prevent the bi&s;hop of Como from granting ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
privileges to tho&s;e who, without entering into
orders, a&s;&s;ume the clerical dre&s;s, and are thereby entitled to
the immunities of the church; al&s;o to correct &s;everal other
abu&s;es, which render the clergy of the Valteline independent
of &s;ecular authority, and in civil and criminal cau&s;es only
amenable to the bi&s;hop of Como. The weekly fairs for the
purcha&s;e of grain are aboli&s;hed, and in their &s;tead the Hou&s;e
of Au&s;tria agrees to &s;upply the Gri&s;ons with a certain quan|tity
for them&s;elves and for the &s;ubject countries, according
to the current price of corn in the Milane&s;e. The duties
upon merchandi&s;e exported from the Milane&s;e are lowered,
and the cu&s;toms both in that country and in the territory
of the Gri&s;ons are e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a permanent footing,
for which purpo&s;e a table of the duties is annexed to the
treaty.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="403">
AT pre&s;ent the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria directs all the affairs of
the Gri&s;ons with the mo&s;t unbounded authority. That
power has acquired this &s;way by regularly di&s;charging the
public pen&s;ions, by holding the leading members of the diet
in its pay, by being a guarantee of the Valteline, and media|tor
in all the di&s;putes between the Gri&s;ons and their &s;ub|jects.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 90.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">LANGUAGES OF THE GRISONS&mdash;PARTICULARLY
THE ROMANSH&mdash;ITS ANTIQUITY&mdash;ORIGIN&mdash;
AND TWO PRINCIPAL DIALECTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE languages of the Gri&s;ons are the Italian, German,
and Roman&s;h. The Italian, which is a jargon &s;imilar
to the Milane&s;e dialect, is &s;poken by the inhabitants of Pre|galia
and Pu&s;chiavo, and in the vallies of Ma&s;ox and Ca|lanca.</P>
<P>THE German is &s;poken throughout the whole League of
the Ten Juri&s;dictions, a few villages excepted; in the League
of God's Hou&s;e, at Avers, Coire, and the four villages; and
in the Grey League, at Splugen, Cepina, and other villages
of the Rheinwald, at Valts, in the valley of St. Pedro, at
Tu&s;is, Reichenau, Feld&s;perg, Tamins, Meyerhof, Ver&s;am,
and Valendros.</P>
<P>SOME of the earlie&s;t and mo&s;t authentic writers upon the
Gri&s;ons have a&s;&s;erted, that the natives of the Rheinwald
&s;peak a Celtic idiom, a language neither German or Ro|man&s;h,
but more &s;imilar to the German; although they are
entirely &s;urrounded by people of a different tongue, and are
neither contiguous, nor have any great intercour&s;e, with the
<PB N="391" REF="405">
German inhabitants. From this remarkable circum&s;tance
they are led to conjecture, that the natives of the Rheinwald
are de&s;cended from the <HI>Lepontii,</HI> a Celtic nation, and con&s;i|dered
as the original inhabitants of this country before the
influx of the Tu&s;cans; and they ground the proofs of this
a&s;&s;ertion upon the numerous names of many ca&s;tles which
&s;eem to be derived from a<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Cluverius and other authors have er|roneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed the Gothic and Celtic nations to have been the <HI>&s;ame,</HI> and their language to have given ri&s;e to the Teuto|nic or German: but the learned tran&s;lator (Dr. Percy, bi&s;hop of Dromore) of Mallet's Northern Antiquities, has e&s;tabli&s;hed, be|yond a doubt, that the Celtic and Gothic na|tions were originally different, and that there was not the lea&s;t affinity between the lan|guages; the Celtic having given ri&s;e to the old Gallic, Briti&s;h, Er&s;e, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the Gothic to the German. See Tran&s;lator's Preface to Mallet's Northern Antiquities.</NOTE> Celtic or German origin. This
hypothe&s;is, however, re&s;ts upon a wrong ba&s;is, and is
grounded upon two mi&s;takes. For in the fir&s;t place, the lan|guage
of the Rheinwald is German; and, &s;econdly, although
the inhabitants of this di&s;trict are immediately &s;urrounded
by per&s;ons &s;peaking the Italian and Roman&s;h, yet they are
within half a day's journey of Roncaglia, Tu&s;is, and Fur&s;te|nau,
where German is the common language. It is more
probable, therefore, that the Rheinwald was peopled by a
German colony, which penetrated into the&s;e regions in the
darker ages, when the Germans i&s;&s;ued from their fore&s;ts, and
&s;pread them&s;elves over Europe. With re&s;pect to the German
names of ca&s;tles and towns we may remark, that many of
them are corrupted from the Roman&s;h, that others have been
adopted in later times; and as a proof, that the Roman&s;h is
more ancient in this country than the German, the greate&s;t
part of the mountains, vallies, and olde&s;t ca&s;tles, have Ro|man&s;h
<PB N="392" REF="406">
appellations, even in the di&s;tricts inhabited by the
Germans<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The German names adopted from the Roman&s;h are very numerous; &s;uch as <HI>Chur</HI> from <HI>Curia</HI> or <HI>Coire, Splugen</HI> or <HI>Speluga, Ce|pina, Tu&s;is</HI> or <HI>To&s;&s;an, Davos, Pretigau</HI> or <HI>Rhetigoua, Ca&s;tles,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The following German names are evi|dently of a very late date: <HI>Fur&s;tenau, Fur|&s;tenberg, Halden&s;tein, Lichten&s;tein, Hein|zenberg, Reichenau, Rheinwald,</HI> &amp;c. as will ea&s;ily be allowed by any one conver&s;ant in that tongue.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS circum&s;tance leads me to the con&s;ideration of the
Rhetian, or as it is more commonly called, the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>It is called by the natives</HI> Arumau$&s;h, Rumaun&s;$h, Roman&s;ch, Lingua Roman&s;cha.</NOTE> Roman&s;h,
which is the vernacular tongue among the greate&s;t part of
the Gri&s;ons; a language in former times more exten&s;ively
diffu&s;ed than it is at pre&s;ent, being &s;poken at Coire and the
adjacent di&s;tricts, and through the Tyrol, as far as Inn&s;pruck.
I had the good fortune to meet with a German tran&s;lation of
Mr. Planta's excellent Treati&s;e upon the Roman&s;h of the Gri|&s;ons,
of which I had before &s;een the original in the Philo&s;o|phical
Tran&s;actions for 1775. The peru&s;al of this treati&s;e
fir&s;t excited my inquiries; and although I am obliged to dif|fer
from the ingenious author in a few in&s;tances, yet I hold
my&s;elf indebted to him, for having greatly facilitated my re|&s;earches,
and for a more accurate knowledge of the &s;ubject
than I could otherwi&s;e have obtained.</P>
<P>THE Roman&s;h of this country is divided into two princi|pal
dialects, the one &s;poken in the Grey League, and the
other in that of God's Hou&s;e. The&s;e two dialects, although
materially varying as to pronunciation and orthography, are
yet &s;ufficiently &s;imilar in the general arrangement and ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="393" REF="407">
to be compri&s;ed within the &s;ame inquiry. It mu&s;t
always be extremely difficult to trace the origin of any lan|guage:
for etymologi&s;ts are too apt to build a favourite
&s;y&s;tem, by mi&s;taking a partial for a general re&s;emblance; and
finding a few &s;imilar expre&s;&s;ions in two languages, which in
other re&s;pects are e&s;&s;entially different, conclude them to be
derived from the &s;ame &s;tock. The Gri&s;on writers, however,
pretend, that the proofs of the antiquity and origin of their
language are too well founded to admit of the lea&s;t doubt.
They a&s;&s;ert that the Rhetian tongue is derived from the
Latin, or from a dialect of the Latin; and the arguments
upon which they ground their a&s;&s;ertion may be reduced to
three principal heads. 1. The hi&s;tory of the country.
2. The names of places which have evidently a Latin origin.
3. Its &s;imilarity to the Latin, and to other languages derived
mediately or immediately from the Latin.</P>
<P>1. THE hi&s;tory of the country. Livy, who has given
the earlie&s;t account of the&s;e Alps, informs us, that under the
reign of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus, a colony of Tu&s;cans, driven
from Lombardy by the Gauls, &s;ettled in the&s;e mountainous
regions; and the &s;ame hi&s;torian adds, that in his time the
Rhetians, who were de&s;cended from the&s;e fir&s;t coloni&s;ts, &s;till
retained &s;ome traces of the Tu&s;can pronunciation, although
vitiated by lap&s;e of time and change of &s;ituation. Since
that period, we have no po&s;itive documents of any &s;ub|&s;equent
emigration, although it is probable, that upon many
occa&s;ions in which the Italians quitted their country, they
retired to the&s;e Alps, and mixed with the natives. In &s;ome
of the&s;e excur&s;ions it is likely, that the inhabitants of La|tium,
<PB N="394" REF="408">
or others, who &s;poke the Latin, or at lea&s;t a dialect of
that tongue, which mu&s;t have had a con&s;iderable affinity to
the Tu&s;can, e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the&s;e regions; but
whether this &s;ettlement happened during the inva&s;ion of
Hannibal, or at any &s;ub&s;equent period, cannot be exactly
a&s;certained. About the time of the Cae&s;ars, Rhetia became
an object of Roman conque&s;t; and frequent expeditions
were made into the&s;e parts, until the whole country was
reduced to a Roman province, and governed by a praetor re|&s;ident
at Coire. During that period, many Roman families
e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the&s;e Alps, and diffu&s;ed the know|ledge
of their language. On the decline of the Roman power,
Rhetia came under the dominion of the Franks, a German
nation. The new people introduced their own tongue into
many places; and in others, gave a new turn and modi|fication
to the Latin, by the addition of auxiliary verbs, and
by the frequent u&s;e of the articles.</P>
<P>2. THE &s;econd proof of the derivation of the Roman&s;h
from the Latin re&s;ts upon the numerous names of moun|tains,
rivers, towns, and ca&s;tles, which evidently &s;eem to
have a Roman origin. To u&s;e the words of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
hi&s;torian<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Aporta, Hi&s;t. I. p. 6.</NOTE>, whom I have &s;o often quoted; &startq;Per&s;ons ver&s;ed
in cla&s;&s;ic antiquity, who travel among the Gri&s;ons, will,
from the frequency of Latin appellations, conceive that they
are pa&s;&s;ing through Latium, Etruria, and Campania. They
will trace the ancient names <HI>Ardeates, Vettones, Sentinates,
Samnites,</HI> in Ardets, Vettan, Sent, and Samnun. They will
<PB N="395" REF="409">
meet with mount <HI>Umbria,</HI> the river <HI>Albula,</HI> the towns <HI>An|tium,
Su&s;a, Lavinium, Tutium, Seaptia, Silium, Cernetia,</HI> and
many others: derivations &s;o plain and &s;o frequently occur|ring
evidently certify their origin.&endq;</P>
<P>3. THE affinity of the Roman&s;h, as well to the Latin,
as to the languages immediately derived from the Latin.
Fir&s;t, a collateral argument in favour of its derivation from
the Latin may be deduced from the word <HI>Roman&s;h,</HI> the
general appellation of the language, and the particular
dialect of Engadina, called <HI>Ladin;</HI> both the&s;e terms having
in effect the &s;ame &s;ignification, <HI>Latin</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Latin and Ladin are the &s;ame words, only differently pronounced: for it mu&s;t be evident to any one the lea&s;t conver&s;ant with different languages, how often the <HI>t</HI> and the <HI>d</HI> are &s;ub&s;tituted for each other. Quinti|lian &s;ays that the old Romans frequently wrote a <HI>t,</HI> before they had any fixed rules of orthography, in&s;tead of a <HI>d;</HI> for Alexander&mdash;Alexanter.</NOTE> and <HI>Roman</HI> being
&s;ynonymous. But without in&s;i&s;ting too much on this con|jecture,
we need only refer to a book written in the Gri&s;on
tongue, to perceive the general affinity of its vocabulary to
that of the Latin. In this compari&s;on, however, great allow|ance
mu&s;t be made for the variation, which mu&s;t have taken
place between a mother tongue, as written in the be&s;t
authors, and its offspring, which for many centuries was
merely colloquial, and which has not only been occa&s;ionally
intermixed with other languages, but has &s;uffered a change
in its general modification by the admi&s;&s;ion of the German
&s;yntax.</P>
<P>YET it by no means follows, that the Roman&s;h, although
the undoubted offspring of the Latin, &s;hould have been
<PB N="396" REF="410">
derived immediately from that language, &s;uch as it is found
in the be&s;t authors, or as configned to writing during any
period of the Roman aera; but rather, that it owed its origin
to the vulgar tongue, as it was &s;poken by the people, or to
&s;ome provincial dialect of Italy. In all living tongues there
is a colloquial as well as a written language: for how
different are the Engli&s;h and Scotti&s;h idioms, and even the
dialects of Lanca&s;hire and Norfolk? In France the Pari&s;ian
accent varies e&s;&s;entially from the provincial pronunciation;
and the &s;everal Patois of Provence, Lorraine, and Ga&s;cony,
cannot be under&s;tood without re&s;pective glo&s;&s;aries. The
&s;ame circum&s;tance prevails in Germany, where the idioms
of the Saxons, Au&s;trians, and Suabians, are &s;carcely in|telligible
to each other. That this was equally the ca&s;e with
the Latin, we may collect not only from the general analogy
of language, but likewi&s;e from the te&s;timony of the be&s;t
authors.</P>
<P>THE origin of the Italian and of the other dialects,
which are derived principally from the Latin, is frequently
attributed to the inva&s;ion of the Goths under Alaric; when a
new language was introduced throughout Italy and the Ro|man
provinces. But this is not preci&s;ely the truth; for the&s;e
&s;everal dialects aro&s;e from a corruption, or at lea&s;t a va|riation,
in the primitive Latin, antecedent to the irruption of
the Goths, or even to the times of the Cae&s;ars. Italy was oc|cupied
by many people originally independent: the <HI>Umbri,
O&s;ci, Samnites, Etru&s;ci,</HI> and <HI>Piceni,</HI> all of whom differed in
dialect, and many in language from the Romans. But
the latter had no &s;ooner conquered Italy, than the Latin
<PB N="397" REF="411">
language came into general u&s;e, though in the &s;everal
provinces it was not uniformly pronounced in the &s;ame
manner; as the natives of every di&s;trict varied in their mode
of articulation. Cicero mentions &s;everal<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among&s;t other examples he &s;ays, that the people in&s;tead of <HI>diem hanc</HI> pronounced <HI>di hanc,</HI> and <HI>cauneas</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>cave ne cas.</HI></NOTE> corruptions of the
Latin which he could &s;carcely comprehend; and Horace al|ludes
to the people of Canu&s;ium, in <HI>Graecia Magna,</HI> as &s;peak|ing
a mixed language<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Cum Pedius cau&s;&s;as ex&s;udet Poplicola atque</L>
<L>Corvinus, patriis intermi&s;cere petita</L>
<L>Verba foris malis, Canu&s;ini more <HI>BILINGUIS?</HI></L>
<L>Lib. I. Sat. x. v. 30.</L></Q></NOTE>. Canu&s;ium contained, be&s;ides the
original Greek natives, many inhabitants from different
parts of Italy, who &s;poke Latin. Hence their language
was a mixture of both Greek and Latin; but &s;o extremely
impure, as to give ri&s;e to the proverb, <HI>Canu&s;ini more bi|linguis.</HI></P>
<P>IN Italy there mu&s;t have been many idioms of this &s;ort,
which were for a long time unob&s;erved. For while Rome
flouri&s;hed, the language of that capital was the &s;tandard of
purity; and all other dialects of the Latin were di&s;regarded.
Yet, even at Rome it&s;elf, the Latin was corrupted at a very
early period. Suetonius<NOTE N="Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Non literas modo &s;ed &s;yllabas permutat aut praeterit. Communis hominum error.</NOTE> relates, that Augu&s;tus frequently af|fected
to write words as they were pronounced, without any
regard to orthography; and to abridge them, by the change
or omi&s;&s;ion of &s;yllables. If this was the practice of the &s;ove|reign
him&s;elf, in the purity of the Augu&s;tan age, and in the
<PB N="398" REF="412">
capital, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that the &s;ame cu&s;tom was &s;till
more prevalent among the people, in the di&s;tant provinces,
and particularly towards the decline of the empire. Thus
the Latin tongue was growing gradually more corrupt, and
would, in proce&s;s of time, have almo&s;t totally varied from its
primitive purity, even if Rome had continued to be the &s;eat
of empire; yet it may be allowed, that its decline was
ha&s;tened by the irruption of the Goths.</P>
<P>SHOULD the&s;e remarks be founded on fact, the Romans
mu&s;t have left traces of their language throughout the dif|ferent
provinces of their va&s;t empire; and the &s;everal
dialects derived from the colloquial Latin, before they were
refined and poli&s;hed, mu&s;t have borne a re&s;emblance to each
other, in &s;ome places more &s;triking, in others more faint and
di&s;tant. And although the&s;e dialects were in &s;ome mea&s;ure
changed and modified by the introduction of the Gothic or
German idiom, which the conquerors gradually e&s;tabli&s;hed
throughout the Roman provinces; yet the &s;ame affinity
mu&s;t have been &s;till ob&s;erved: tho&s;e changes affected <HI>all</HI> the
dialects, and con&s;i&s;ted not &s;o much in varying the expre&s;&s;ions,
as in giving a new modification to the general &s;yntax, by
the introduction of the auxiliary verbs, by the indeclen|&s;ion
of the ca&s;es, and by the nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e of prepo&s;itions
and articles.</P>
<P>IF therefore the Romans e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the
country of the Gri&s;ons &s;o effectually as to introduce their
own language; and if that tongue, derived from the collo|quial
Latin, and &s;till further modified by the adoption of the
<PB N="399" REF="413">
German &s;yntax, is, from the peculiar &s;ituation of the natives,
and from its not having been con&s;igned to writing till within
the&s;e la&s;t two hundred years, little changed from its primi|tive
&s;tate; we have rea&s;on to expect, that it &s;hould bear
evident marks of affinity to tho&s;e dialects which have ori|ginated
from the colloquial Latin, and were equally modified
by the German &s;yntax; it follows al&s;o, that the re&s;emblance
will be greater in proportion as we can trace earlier and
ruder &s;pecimens: and this analogy is con&s;onant to expe|rience.
The earlie&s;t language, which undoubtedly draws its
origin from the colloquial Latin, is the ancient Roman&s;h,
called <HI>Lingua Romana,</HI> the mother of the French tongue. It
was under&s;tood in Italy, in the Morea, and Con&s;tantinople,
and was univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed throughout the &s;outhern parts
of Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Mr. Planta,
in the treati&s;e to which I alluded at the beginning of this
letter, has unque&s;tionably proved that this tongue and the
Roman&s;h of the Gri&s;ons are the &s;ame language.</P>
<P>WE cannot expect, perhaps, the &s;ame evident affinity
between the Roman&s;h of the Gri&s;ons and any other lan|guage
now exi&s;ting; but in comparing it with the Italian,
and particularly &s;ome provincial dialects of Italy, the
Spani&s;h<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In comparing it with the Spani&s;h, we mu&s;t exclude tho&s;e words which have a &s;trong guttural pronunciation, and are evidently derived from the Arabic.</NOTE>, the Patois of Provence, Languedoc, Ga&s;cony,
and Lorraine, we &s;hall ea&s;ily perceive, that they originated
from the &s;ame &s;tock, with the difference which time, a va|riety
of pronunciation, and the mixture of other tongues,
<PB N="400" REF="414">
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion in all languages. With re&s;pect to
the Italian, it is remarkable that the Roman&s;h le&s;s re&s;em|bles
the pure Tu&s;can idiom than the provincial dialects; a
circum&s;tance ea&s;ily accounted for. The Tu&s;can has been
gradually purified and refined, until it has undergone a total
change from its original &s;tate; and the provincial dialects,
being le&s;s committed to writing, have not been &s;ubject to
&s;uch variation.</P>
<P>To the&s;e languages I may add that &s;poken by the
Vaudois, inhabiting the valleys of Piedmont, in the &s;ixteenth
century, of which Leger has printed &s;pecimens, the ori|ginals
whereof are now extant in the public library at
Cambridge, and al&s;o the Wallachian tongue. The latter is
derived from the Latin, introduced by the colony of Ro|mans,
which Trajan e&s;tabli&s;hed in tho&s;e parts. The pre&s;ent
natives, de&s;cendants of that colony, although &s;urrounded by
people &s;peaking the Hungarian and Sclavonian, talk a lan|guage
in which evident traces of the original Latin are
&s;till pre&s;erved. It bears a general re&s;emblance to the Italian;
and Mr. Aporta, who pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in Hungary, in|formed
me, that, allowing for the variety of pronuncia|tion,
he comprehended the natives, and found in their
expre&s;&s;ions no incon&s;iderable degree of a&s;&s;inity to the
Roman&s;h.</P>
<P>THE Roman&s;h of the Gri&s;ons, as I have before ob&s;erved,
is divided into two principal dialects, that of the Grey League
and the <HI>Ladin</HI> of Engadina; for it is needle&s;s to mention &s;e|parately
the Roman&s;h &s;poken in the valleys of Mun&s;ter and
<PB N="401" REF="415">
Sur&s;et. The two dialects perfectly agree in the grammatical
arrangement, but differ widely in the pronunciation and or|thography:
of the two, the <HI>Ladin,</HI> being le&s;s intermixed
with foreign words, is the pure&s;t; the Roman&s;h of the Grey
League, from the number of German colonies blended with
the natives, abounds more in German expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ladin</HI> is divided into the two idioms of Upper and
Lower Engadina: the vocabulary of both is the &s;ame, with a
&s;mall variety of accent<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>To give an in&s;tance of this difference.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Lower Engadina pronounce the <HI>a</HI> open as we do in <HI>war,</HI> while tho&s;e of Upper Engadina u&s;e an <HI>ae</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>a.</HI>

chiefly from the different manner of articulating the vowels.
The inhabitants of Lower Engadina &s;peak with a broader
accent, like the Dorians among the Greeks; while tho&s;e of
Upper Engadina, like the Ionians, u&s;e a &s;ofter pronunciation.
Hence is derived a variety in the orthography of the two
idioms: and books, although perfectly under&s;tood by both,
are printed &s;omewhat differently in the two di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>BEFORE the introduction of the reformation among the
Gri&s;ons, the Roman&s;h was e&s;teemed &s;o barbarous a jargon as
to be thought incapable of being reduced to grammatical ac|curacy
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aporta, lib. 2. p. 403.</NOTE>. It is no wonder, that the monks, who&s;e intere&s;t it

was to keep the people in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance, &s;hould have
favoured this opinion; but it is a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment,
that the mo&s;t learned among the native laics, and &s;uch in|telligent
foreigners as<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rhaetica lingua tam perplexa et impe|dita e&s;t, ut &s;cribi nequeat; unde omnes literae ab antiquis con&s;ectae, Latine &s;criptae &s;unt, et quas hodie parant, Germanice &s;cribi procu|rant. <HI>See T&s;chudi Alp.

&s;upported a notion &s;o contradictory to common &s;en&s;e. For
although it is an evident axiom, that all living tongues may
be reduced to certain principles, and con&s;igned to writing;
yet the barbari&s;m of the Roman&s;h was &s;o univer&s;ally preva|lent,
that no attempt was made to write it before the &s;ixteenth
century. The per&s;on to whom the Gri&s;ons owe the fir&s;t
production in their native tongue, was John de Travers; a
man who blending the characters of the &s;oldier, politician,
&s;cholar, and divine, performed the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices
to his country; by his valour in arms, by his &s;kill in ne|gociation,
by cultivating and protecting letters, and by fa|vouring
and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the introduction of the reformed
religion.</P>
<P>THIS re&s;pectable per&s;on, of a noble and opulent family
of Zutz in Upper Engadina, was born in 1483: before the
eighth year of his age he was &s;ent for his education to
Munich, and from thence into Tran&s;ylvania. Being there
&s;eized with a de&s;ire of travelling, he remained ab&s;ent thir|teen
years: and returned to Zutz about the 28th year of his
<PB N="403" REF="417">
age. Highly di&s;tingui&s;hed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ille quidem anno 1483 natus, bis Vallis Tellinae Gubernator, Epi&s;copalis Aulae Cura|tor, plurimis ad exteros Principes legationibus clarus, in Patria vero omnibus honoris gra|dibus nactus, eruditione, dexteritate, et auc|toritate unus in Raetia florebat; ut Re$pub|licae lumen, &s;idus, et decus merito habeatur.

abilities, he acquired univer&s;al e&s;teem; and was rai&s;ed to
every honour which his grateful country was capable of
be&s;towing. Indeed &s;uch was the re&s;pect generally &s;hewn
to his &s;uperior talents, that no affair of moment was tran&s;|acted
by the Republic of the Gri&s;ons in which he was not
con&s;ulted. His acquaintance with foreign languages, his
knowledge of the world, and the politene&s;s of his addre&s;s,
rendered him the fitte&s;t in&s;trument to negotiate with foreign
powers; and he always acquitted him&s;elf with honour of
the tru&s;t which was repo&s;ed in him. In a military line he
greatly &s;ignalized him&s;elf as commander of the Gri&s;on forces
again&s;t James of Medicis, for the rapidity of his movements,
his per&s;onal valour, and cautious conduct; and by laying &s;iege
to the fortre&s;s of Mu&s;&s;on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Situated near the Lake of Como, not far from Gravedona.</NOTE>, he brought the campaign to a
&s;peedy and &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>HE was greatly in&s;trumental in forwarding the progre&s;s
of the reformation. Although inclined to favour the new
doctrines, yet he was never hurried away by a mi&s;guided
zeal. Aver&s;e to renounce the religion in which he had been
educated, without the &s;tronge&s;t conviction of its &s;uper&s;titious
<PB N="404" REF="418">
tendency, he &s;tudied the controver&s;y between the two &s;ects,
and weighed the arguments on both &s;ides with the utmo&s;t
deliberation; but he no &s;ooner became a pro&s;elyte to the
reformed opinions, than he &s;hewed him&s;elf as zealous in
promoting, as he had previou&s;ly been circum&s;pect in adopt|ing
them. Nor did he only favour the reformation by his
example and authority, but he even promulgated its doc|trines.
As few natives of Engadina were qualified, by
their learning and theological knowledge, to preach in the
Ladin, the progre&s;s of the reformation was con&s;iderably
retarded. For the&s;e rea&s;ons John de Travers, who had cri|tically
&s;tudied and written in his own tongue, conde&s;cended
to in&s;truct the people. Having obtained permi&s;&s;ion of the
church, he a&s;cended the pulpit<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Stupuit tunc ordo Evangelicus, &s;tupuit tota Raetia contemplans eximium inclitumque Heroa, inter Raetiae gentis optimates, diu principem habitum, &s;ummis etiam, patriae honoribus, debito virtutibus premio in&s;ignitum, &s;enio nunc confec$um &s;ugge&s;tu in publica &s;acra aede con&s;cen&s;o, populum docere, et alia Eccle&s;ia|&s;tica munia, quando res po&s;cebat, operam &s;uam cum ordinario Mini&s;tro conjungendo, et labo|rem participando, &s;ummo audientium applau&s;u undique ex locis cirea vicinis, integris turmis ad ejus &s;ermones audiendos confluentibus, obiit. <HI>Aporta, tom. p.</HI> 239.</NOTE>, and explained in the mo&s;t
per&s;picuous manner the Chri&s;tian doctrines. His di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
abilities, his exalted rank, his venerable age, and his
amiable character, drew from all quarters a numerous au|dience;
while his di&s;cour&s;es, delivered with a noble &s;impli|city
of eloquence, made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and never
failed to increa&s;e the number of pro&s;elytes. This re&s;pect|able
man fini&s;hed his career, which had been &s;o u&s;eful to
his country, and &s;o honourable to him&s;elf, in 1563, and in
the 80th year of his age. His writings in the Ladin, which
<PB N="405" REF="419">
gave ri&s;e to this digre&s;&s;ion, were, a poem in rhyme, de|&s;cribing
the war of Mu&s;&s;on; many &s;ermons; and &s;everal
&s;acred dramas in ver&s;e.</P>
<P>THE example of committing the Ladin to writing was
next followed by Philip Salutz, called Gallicius, one of the
earlie&s;t reformers among the Gri&s;ons; who, in 1534, tran&s;|lated
the Lord's prayer, the Apo&s;tles' creed, and the deca|logue,
into the dialect of Lower Engadina; and not long
afterwards, from the Hebrew into the &s;ame language, &s;ome
chapters of Gene&s;is, and the Athana&s;ian Creed; which
were di&s;tributed in manu&s;cript among the natives. Huldric
Campel wrote &s;everal &s;acred dramas, in the repre&s;entation of
which he him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and al&s;o turned &s;ome of the
p&s;alms into ver&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e compo&s;itions, being only to be found in manu|&s;cript,
were too &s;carce to be of general u&s;e; and James Tut&s;|chet,
of Samada, more known by the name of Biveronius,
was the fir&s;t who ventured to publi&s;h in his native tongue.
That celebrated reformer finding, from experience, that the
want of religious books in the colloquial language was a
great ob&s;truction to the progre&s;s of the reformation, printed
at Pu&s;chiavo, in 1560, a &s;mall work<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>I po&s;&s;e&s;s a copy of this &s;carce work, re|printed at Zuric 1621, but without the title page.

Commandments, and &s;everal occa&s;ional prayers. This little
publication being well received, was followed by a work of
the greate&s;t importance, a tran&s;lation of the New Te&s;ta|ment

of David, and other hymns done into ver&s;e, for the u&s;e of
the reformed churches: this publication afforded a &s;triking
proof of the author's genius and ta&s;te, that he was able to
give &s;o much harmony of metre and variety of rhymes to
the language in &s;o rude a &s;tate. Be&s;ides the benefits which
this p&s;alter produced in a religious light, it was &s;erviceable
in a literary view, as it contributed to diffu&s;e a ta&s;te for po|etical
compo&s;ition among his countrymen; and convinced
them that divine truths might be inculcated in a plea&s;ing
diction. Mr. Aporta, in his excellent Hi&s;tory of the Refor|m&agrave;tion
among the Gri&s;ons, &s;ays that the language of Bive|ronius
is (like infant dialects) &s;o rude and unpoli&s;hed, both
as to the mode of expre&s;&s;ion and orthography, that it is
&s;carcely under&s;tood at pre&s;ent; that Campel greatly refined
it, and endeavoured as much as po&s;&s;ible to reduce the words
and orthography to a &s;imilarity with the Latin, which was
the original mother tongue. Hence we may ob&s;erve, that
the publications of Biveronius afford the mo&s;t curious &s;pe|cimen

of the Ladin, as it exi&s;ted in its mo&s;t ancient &s;tate,
when it was chiefly a colloquial language<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall in&s;ert as a &s;pecimen of his language in the end of this letter, the Apo&s;tles' Creed, publi&s;hed in 1571. N&deg; 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE po&s;&s;ibility of writing and printing the Ladin was no
&s;ooner proved by &s;uch authorities, than the pre&s;s teemed
with productions calculated to di&s;&s;eminate the reformed
opinions. The&s;e publications, however, (not excepting
even the performance of Campel) as well as all which ap|peared
in the fifteenth and in the beginning of the &s;ixteenth
century, are now ob&s;olete; and, without a glo&s;&s;ary, almo&s;t
unintelligible to the natives them&s;elves, who have not made
them the object of their particular &s;tudy.</P>
<P>No ver&s;ion of the whole Bible was publi&s;hed in the
Ladin before the year 1679: it was printed at Scuol<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">N&deg; 5.</NOTE>, in the
dialect of Lower Engadina; and republi&s;hed, with various
explanations and a new index, in 1743. Be&s;ides the tran&s;|lation
of the New Te&s;tament by Biveronius, which is ob&s;olete,
a new<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">N&deg; 6.</NOTE> ver&s;ion was printed in 1640 in the dialect of Upper
Engadina, and is in common u&s;e. But the natives of this
di&s;trict have no other ver&s;ion of the Old Te&s;tament than
that of Lower Engadina.</P>
<P>As it would be unintere&s;ting to &s;end you a dry catalogue
of the &s;everal publications in the Ladin, I &s;hall therefore
only remark in general, that except a hi&s;tory<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">N&deg; 7.</NOTE> of the Gri|&s;ons,
compiled from various authors by Aporta, the books
<PB N="408" REF="422">
in this tongue &s;olely treat of religious &s;ubjects. Some of our
theological tracts, particularly written by our divines of the
la&s;t century, are tran&s;lated into their language; of the&s;e I
ob&s;erved, among the li&s;t of books in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, Bayley's
Practice of Piety, and Baxter on Vows.</P>
<P>THE Roman&s;h of the Grey League remains to be con|&s;idered.
The earlie&s;t publication in this dialect is a cate|chi&s;m
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">N&deg; 8.</NOTE>, tran&s;lated from the German by Daniel Boniface,
pa&s;tor of Fur&s;tenau, and printed in 1601. It was &s;oon fol|lowed
by a metrical ver&s;ion of &s;everal p&s;alms<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">N&deg; 9.</NOTE>, accompanied
with other hymns, publi&s;hed at Coire in 1611. The author
of this u&s;eful p&s;alter was Stephen Gabriel, a native of Vet|tan,
in Lower Engadina, and pa&s;tor of Ilants: he was a man
of con&s;iderable learning; and his zeal for the reformed re|ligion
expo&s;ed him to the fury of the Catholics, who, in 1620,
plundered his hou&s;e, burnt his library, and hanged him in
effigy. Gabriel having e&s;caped to Zuric, drew up, during
his retirement, an account of that controver&s;y between the
Prote&s;tants and Roman Catholics, which in tho&s;e turbulent
times nearly excited a civil war among the Gri&s;ons. This
polemic treati&s;e, written in the Roman&s;h, was printed at
Zuric in 1625; and was an&s;wered in 1630 by a Roman
Catholic prie&s;t, in the &s;ame tongue: a work which is proba|bly
the fir&s;t production printed by the Catholics in the
Roman&s;h. Upon the ce&s;&s;ation of the civil commotions
Gabriel returned to Ilants, where he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of
his days in tranquillity.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="423">
STEPHEN was &s;ucceeded in his preferment and literary
pur&s;uits by his &s;on Lucius Gabriel, who, in 1648, gave a
ver&s;ion of the New Te&s;tament<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">N&deg; 10.</NOTE>; a work much wanted, as
the inhabitants of the Grey League were mo&s;tly ignorant of
any but their own language, and could with difficulty
comprehend the tran&s;lation in the dialect of Engadina. It
is remarkable, that this ver&s;ion, which was printed only
forty-eight years after the Roman&s;h of the Grey League
became a written language, &s;hould &s;till continue in u&s;e; a
proof either, that the language has not received that degree
of refinement which the Ladin has experienced; or that
the fir&s;t per&s;ons who wrote in this idiom took great pains to
&s;ettle the orthography, and arrange the grammatical con|&s;truction.
The li&s;t of books publi&s;hed in this dialect are,
for the mo&s;t part, far inferior, both as to number and merit,
to tho&s;e written in the Ladin; for, excepting the two Ga|briels,
the Grey League has furni&s;hed few men who have
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by &s;uperior learning.</P>
<P>A COMPLETE tran&s;lation of the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">N&deg; 11.</NOTE> Bible was not given before
the year 1718: it was publi&s;hed at Coire, at the expence of
the Clergy of the Grey League, and dedicated by the printer
to George the Fir&s;t, who &s;ent in return a pre&s;ent of fifty
guineas. This &s;um being delivered to the printer, and
claimed by him as his own property, occa&s;ioned a law-&s;uit
between him and the editors: the latter, however, although
in equity they had the &s;ole right, were never able to obtain
any part of the donation.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FROM DAVID PENNANT, ESQ. TO THE AUTHOR.
ON THE ITALIAN BAILLIAGES OF SWITZERLAND&mdash;
JOURNEY FROM THE TOP OF THE ST. GOTHARD
TO MILAN&mdash;THE LEVANTINE VALLEY&mdash;BELLIN|ZONE
&mdash;LOCARNO&mdash;TOWN AND LAKE OF LUGANO&mdash;
LAGO MAGGIORE&mdash;BOROMEAN ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LITTLE is wanting to complete your de&s;cription of
Switzerland and its dependencies; that cha&s;m I now en|deavour
to fill up. Youth and inexperience mu&s;t &s;erve as
excu&s;es for errors and omi&s;&s;ions. Happy if this ha&s;ty &s;ketch
may excite the curio&s;ity of your&s;elf, or any other traveller
equally intelligent, who&s;e ob&s;ervations may amu&s;e and in|&s;truct
mankind. The route which I here attempt to
de&s;cribe, is connected with your work; a route which would
afford &s;atisfaction to the curious of all nations who take you
as their guide.</P>
<P>THE highe&s;t parts of the principal Alpine pa&s;&s;es are
u&s;ually occupied by a &s;mall plain or ba&s;on; as the St. Ber|nard,
the Gemmi, the Splugen, and the St. Gothard. From
the &s;ummit of the St. Gothard I commenced my route on
the 2d of Augu&s;t 1786. I followed the cour&s;e of the Te&s;ino,
which you mention in your letters: it pa&s;&s;es by the Capuchin
convent, and is &s;oon after joined by two other rills from the
<PB N="414" REF="428">
neighbouring mountains. Near this &s;pot the Levantine
valley begins, and Switzerland, properly &s;o called, may be
&s;aid to terminate. The de&s;cent on the &s;ide of Italy is much
&s;teeper, and the views more &s;avage and picture&s;que, than in
the a&s;cent from Ur&s;eren; and the road is conducted with
equal &s;kill. The maje&s;tic &s;cenery is heightened by the
Te&s;ino tumbling in an almo&s;t uninterrupted cataract; &s;ome|times
pent up in a narrow channel, or piercing its way
through the remains of Avalanches, &s;till unmelted though
fully expo&s;ed to the rays of a meridian &s;un. The&s;e enor|mous
ma&s;&s;es ob&s;truct the road; and workmen are conti|nually
employed in promoting their di&s;&s;olution; as the ag|gregate
of unmelted &s;nows, for a few &s;ummers, would bar
all communication between Switzerland and Italy: with
&s;uch difficulty are the few pa&s;&s;es kept open!</P>
<P>AFTER de&s;cending rapidly for three miles through this
&s;cene of de&s;olation, bounded on all &s;ides by precipices, or im|pending
rocks, the river foaming over blocks of granite, the
ruins of the &s;urrounding mountains; we cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Ponte
Tremolo,</HI> or trembling bridge; where the view enlarged, and
extended over a verdant valley &s;prinkled with numerous
hou&s;es. Airolo, the fir&s;t &s;mall burgh, &s;tands at the bottom
of the &s;teep de&s;cent; to the right is the pa&s;&s;age over mount
Grias to Mun&s;ter in the Upper Vallais, practicable only from
the middle of July to October, when 300 hor&s;es tran&s;port
weekly the chee&s;e from the various parts of Switzerland.</P>
<P>AT Dacio we found comfortable accommodations: that
village con&s;i&s;ts only of a few hou&s;es, &s;eated at the entrance
<PB N="415" REF="429">
of a pa&s;s, capable of being defended with ea&s;e again&s;t the
whole force of Italy. A wall and gate is added to its natural
&s;trength, but their principal u&s;e is to prevent contraband
trade, and to exact al&s;o a &s;mall toll for the merchandi&s;e
which pa&s;&s;es that way. For half a league from hence is a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;triking and romantic &s;cenery; the perpen|dicular
rocks &s;carcely affording room for the &s;teep road, and
tran&s;parent waters of the Te&s;ino, which, thundering over the
va&s;t fragments, ri&s;es in a white foam, and &s;ubtle mi&s;t, vi&s;ible
only from refracting the rays of the &s;un. We cro&s;&s;ed the
torrent, in that &s;hort &s;pace, over three bridges thrown from
rock to rock, who&s;e &s;pan and boldne&s;s of execution might
vie with the boa&s;ted, becau&s;e better known, Devil's Bridge.
Faido is the re&s;idence of the bailif, nominated by the canton
of Uri. He remains in office four years, and his power is
almo&s;t unlimited. Unfortunate in&s;urrections in 1712, and in
1755, have been attended with the lo&s;s of the few remaining
privileges to a people who &s;truggled for perfect liberty.
Giornico, called by the Germans Irnis, is famous for the
victory which 600 Swi&s;s gained, in 1478, over the troops of
the duke of Milan, amounting to 15, 000 men; a victory
which en&s;ured to the Swi&s;s an honourable and advantageous
peace. In this neighbourhood we fir&s;t perceived the effects
of a &s;outhern &s;un, and a le&s;&s;er elevation above the &s;ea, by the
frequent appearance of vineyards, and the walnut and
che&s;nut-trees of a very large &s;ize; the girth of &s;everal among
the latter was not le&s;s than thirty feet. At Polegio, this bail|liage
ends.</P>
<P>THE Levantine Valley, or <HI>Valle Levantina,</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to
retain, by its name, traces of the <HI>Lepontii,</HI> the antient inha|bitants
<PB N="416" REF="430">
of the &s;urrounding regions. Its length, counting from
the &s;ummit of the pa&s;&s;age on the St. Gothard, is about eight
leagues: the breadth very incon&s;iderable. The lower part
is extremely populous, rich in pa&s;turage, and produces much
hemp and flax. In the neighbourhood of &s;uch lofty moun|tains,
its climate mu&s;t be variable, and liable to frequent
rains. In order to prevent the&s;e rains from damaging their
crops, the inhabitants &s;u&s;pend and dry the corn and gra&s;s on
&s;everal bars &s;upported by two high poles about fifteen feet
a&s;under. The hou&s;es are entirely of wood, and have exter|nally
the appearance of Swi&s;s cottages; but a neglect of
cleanline&s;s proves the vicinity and greater &s;imilarity to the
Italians. The Te&s;ino is here joined by the Bromio, a torrent
which takes its ri&s;e in mount Uccello, or the Vogel&s;berg,
near Splugen; a bridge over it is the boundary of the two
bailliages of the valleys Levantine and Pole&s;e, and leads into
that of Riviera. The valley now becomes perfectly flat, and
of cour&s;e &s;ubject to violent inundations; the few villages
are &s;cattered on the &s;ides of the &s;teep mountains; below all
is de&s;olate. O&s;&s;ogna, the re&s;idence of the bailif, con&s;i&s;ts only
of a few hou&s;es. The country &s;oon improved; the ground
ro&s;e gently from the bed of the river, when we came in
&s;ight of the beautiful town of Bellinzone, &s;ituated in a de|lightful
plain, encircled with ancient walls and battlements
in good repair: to the right, ri&s;e maje&s;tically the ruins of
an ancient ca&s;tle; to the left, &s;eparately embo&s;omed in trees,
are the ca&s;tles of the bailifs of the three regent cantons, Uri,
Schweitz, and Underwalden.</P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of the fifteenth century, the Swi&s;s,
at peace with the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, &s;eem fir&s;t to have been &s;ti|mulated
<PB N="417" REF="431">
with the ambition of extending their dominions
towards the &s;outh. In 1410, the whole Helvetic body, ex|cepting
the canton of Berne, pa&s;&s;ed their natural barriers,
plundered the town of Domo d'O&s;cella, and the adjacent
country, and returned laden with &s;poil to pa&s;s the winter in
their humble cottages. Elevated by &s;ucce&s;s, the en&s;uing
&s;ummer &s;aw them again de&s;cend into the plains of Italy, and
ravage the duchy of Milan, then &s;ubject to the Vi&s;contis.
They again retired, but without attempting to make a &s;ettle|ment.
Bent on the&s;e enterpri&s;es, we are not &s;urpri&s;ed, that,
in 1422, the three original cantons purcha&s;ed the town of
Bellinzone from its owners the counts of Sax; or that Philip
Maria, duke of Milan, exerted him&s;elf to prevent from
falling into their hands a town &s;o important, from its &s;itua|tion
and natural &s;trength, to check their inroads, and cover
his dominions. Having therefore taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it by
force of arms; a body of 8000 Swi&s;s pa&s;&s;ed the Alps. The
forces of both nations met; the Italians were led on by
Carmagnola; a bloody battle en&s;ued, of which both &s;ides
claimed the victory; the Swi&s;s retired with a &s;tandard taken
from the enemy, who remained ma&s;ters of the town.</P>
<P>EXCEPTING &s;ome inroads, nothing of importance was
again tran&s;acted to the &s;outh till the year 1466, when Ga|leazzo
Maria Sforza, the new duke of Milan, formed an
alliance with his tran&s;alpine neighbours; the fir&s;t article was
the ce&s;&s;ion of the Levantine Valley to the canton of Uri, for
which he was annually to receive three hawks and a cro&s;s|bow.
Yet ten years after, when Charles duke of Burgundy
threatened the total de&s;truction of the republic by his power|ful
<PB N="418" REF="432">
inva&s;ions, the treacherous duke of Milan &s;ent a body of
troops to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who were intercepted in the Vallais
and wor&s;ted. On the defeat and death of Charles at the
battle of Nancy, they again re&s;olved to make an attempt on
Bellinzone: but as the &s;ea&s;on was too far advanced to under|take
the &s;iege, a body of 600 Swi&s;s re&s;olved to winter at
Giornico. The duke collected an army of 15, 000 men, and
attacked them in their entrenchments, but was repul&s;ed
with the lo&s;s of 1400 of his be&s;t troops. The mountaineers
were enriched with the &s;poils; but no regular attack was
made on the object of their inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>FROM this period the wars in which the Swi&s;s engaged
no ways concerned them&s;elves: they &s;acrificed their blood
in foreign quarrels, and the contending parties made u&s;e of
their &s;uperior valour to attempt or e&s;tabli&s;h conque&s;ts in
Italy. In 1500 the three cantons obtained what they had &s;o
long contended for. The inhabitants of Bellinzone, vexed
by the frequent changes in the Milane&s;e, voluntarily &s;ur|rendered
to them. The French, when they had conquered
the duchy, in vain reclaimed it; the Swi&s;s retained po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion;
and the &s;even Italian bailliages were formally ceded
to them by Maximilian Sforza, in gratitude for their having
rein&s;tated him in the ducal &s;eat. Courted or feared by all
parties, tho&s;e valuable territories were confirmed to them by
the French, and finally by the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>THE bailif remains in office two years; he is nominated
reciprocally by the three cantons, and is generally removed
from Riviera the poore&s;t, to Bellinzone the mo&s;t lucrative of
<PB N="419" REF="433">
the three governments. An appeal lies from his deci&s;ion to
the &s;yndicate, and from that court to the three cantons. In
eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, the inhabitants are cognizable to the
bi&s;hop of Como, excepting three pari&s;hes. Mo&s;t of the
natives under&s;tand Italian, but the language is a corrupt
German.</P>
<P>THE interior of Bellinzone by no means corre&s;ponds with
its external beauty and &s;ituation; the &s;treets are narrow, and
the hou&s;es ill built. We continued our journey &s;outh on the
banks of the Te&s;ino, which we cro&s;&s;ed in a bad ferry; that
river is here increa&s;ed to a very con&s;iderable &s;ize, by the nu|merous
additions it has received in its cour&s;e, particularly by
the Mu&s;a, a torrent which takes its ri&s;e in the St. Bernardin,
and flowing down the Val Ma&s;ox, forms a junction above
Bellinzone. The valley is level, and laid wa&s;te by numerous
torrents: the road runs along the &s;ides of the hills through
continued vineyards. We proceeded at the foot of the
we&s;tern chain of hills; a &s;imilar ridge bounds the view to
the Ea&s;t, both clothed to their &s;ummits with woods of che&s;nut
and walnut trees, half concealing frequent &s;pires and nume|rous
hamlets. Before us the view extended to a part of the
Milane&s;e over the lake of Locarno, or Lago Maggiore.
Having reached its north-we&s;tern extremity, we coa&s;ted its
banks for two or three miles; and arrived at the town from
which it derives its name. Locarno contains about 1500 in|habitants.
Part of the town is built on piazzas in form
of a cre&s;cent with two wings; in front is a row of trees, and
a public walk; the old part of the town is dirty, and the
&s;treets narrow. It contains three convents, and a &s;mall Fran|ci&s;can
<PB N="420" REF="434">
mona&s;tery, perched on a rock overhanging the valley,
and commanding a &s;uperb view of the lake, and its magnifi|cent
boundaries. The canopy, in the church of the Ca|puchins,
de&s;erves to be mentioned for its beautiful execu|tion:
it is of &s;traw-work, and almo&s;t rivals velvet and
gold fringe.</P>
<P>OF the four tran&s;alpine bailliages which belong to the
twelve cantons, Lugano holds the princpal rank; Locarno
the &s;econd. The governor or commi&s;&s;ary, as he is called, is
&s;ent in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by all the cantons except Appenzel; he
remains in office two years; in criminal affairs his deci|&s;ion
is ab&s;olute, in civil an appeal lies to the annual &s;yndicate
from the regent cantons, and from thence to the Helvetic
body a&s;&s;embled at the diet. The emoluments of this po&s;t
are not great; but the profits unfortunately depend too
much on the virtue of the man, as they ari&s;e principally
from fines exacted for criminal offences. The people enjoy
&s;ome privileges, and hold an annual a&s;&s;embly in the month
of January, in which they elect twenty coun&s;ellors; twelve
out of the town, three from A&s;cona, the remainder from the
country at large. The&s;e coun&s;ellors have the charge of watch|ing
over the intere&s;ts of the republic, as far as does not inter|fere
with the &s;uperior powers, of &s;ettling the public expences,
and of rai&s;ing the &s;upplies paid to the governor. The&s;e
bailliages do not rai&s;e corn &s;ufficient for their dome&s;tic con|&s;umption;
that grain is furni&s;hed by treaty from the duchy
of Milan, and is weekly imported from Livino, a village on
the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. The chief food of the pea&s;ants is a cake
made with maize and millet: the inhabitants on the banks
<PB N="421" REF="435">
of the lake are well &s;upplied with fi&s;h. The fi&s;heries give
employment to a great number of hands, although they are
in &s;ome degree &s;ubject to monopolies. In the months of May
and June, from 200 to 250 lb. weight are taken in a day;
trout of 40 lb. and perch of 9 lb. are found in the lake.</P>
<P>IN 1555, the doctrines of the reformation had made con|&s;iderable
progre&s;s in the&s;e parts: but the Catholic cantons, at
the general diet, obtained an edict, that tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to
return to the antient faith &s;hould quit the town and pro|vince.
Numbers, thus driven from their native country,
were received with open arms by the canton of Zuric,
which was benefited by their indu&s;try, and owes to them
the introduction of their &s;ilk manufactures.</P>
<P>LOCARNO once was &s;ituated on the lake, and had a port
capable of receiving large barks: at pre&s;ent it &s;tands at the
di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile; a circum&s;tance owing to
the accumulation of &s;and brought down by the torrent
Maggia. The little voyage from hence to Magadino is de|lightful:
we cro&s;&s;ed the upper part of the lake in an hour;
the banks of this noble piece of water ri&s;e boldly, and are
well wooded; Locarno forms a fine object, to the &s;outh of it
is the opening into the Val Maggia, terminated by moun|tains
covered with eternal &s;now. The &s;pot where we
landed con&s;i&s;ts only of a few &s;cattered hou&s;es, for the
purpo&s;e of receiving the merchandize, which is put on
&s;hore and &s;ent on hor&s;es to Bellinzone. Old Magadino is
more inland, and owed its origin to the vicinity of the lake,
<PB N="422" REF="436">
the retiring of which has cau&s;ed its ruin: from thence the
road winds up the &s;teep &s;ides of the mountain Cenero,
through woods of walnut and che&s;nut-trees, inter&s;per&s;ed
with oak and holly; on the &s;ummit of the pa&s;&s;age is a &s;mall
oval plain, the boundary of the bailliages of Locarno and
Lugano. Our de&s;cent lay between the hills, through lux|uriant
and verdant vallies, peopled with numerous villages,
and rich in every production. The vines, laden with fruit,
are conducted in elegant fe&s;toons from tree to tree; a con|&s;tant
variety of &s;cenery, &s;oftened by the glow of a &s;etting
&s;un, and next &s;ilvered by the moon glimmering on the di&s;|tant
lake, heightened the charms of our journey through
this Ely&s;ian country.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of Lugano is delightful: it is built round
the gentle curve of a bay, and backed by a fine &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
hills, ri&s;ing in gentle &s;wells to a con&s;iderable height: in
front, a bold mountain clothed with fore&s;t projects into the
lake, of which a noble branch extends to its right and left.
To that &s;pot boats of every &s;ize are continually pa&s;&s;ing
and repa&s;&s;ing, its ba&s;e being perforated with <HI>cantine,</HI> or ca|verns,
to which the inhabitants &s;end their meat, and all
&s;orts of provi&s;ion, where it is kept untainted for &s;even or
eight days, and the wine pre&s;erved with a delicious coolne&s;s.
Enjoying the advantages of a &s;outhern climate, it has few of
its inconveniences: the heats are moderated by the &s;ur|rounding
hills and the cool breezes from the lake. It is no
le&s;s &s;heltered from the Alpine bla&s;ts, which, chilled by the
neighbouring &s;nows, would otherwi&s;e de&s;cend with vio|lence,
<PB REF="437">
<FIGURE>

<PB N="423" REF="438">
and de&s;troy the temperature of this equal climate.
Olive, almond, and all the &s;outhern fruits, ripen here to
perfection.</P>
<P>LUGANO is the emporium of the greate&s;t part of the
merchandize which pa&s;&s;es from Italy over the St. Gothard,
or the Bernardin. At the end of autumn, the Swi&s;s moun|taineers
bring down numerous herds of cattle for &s;ale; and
return with le&s;s bulky commodities. The town contains
about 8000 inhabitants. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are built of
tuf-&s;tone: the re&s;idence of the <HI>capitano,</HI> or governor, is a
low building; on the walls are the arms of the twelve
regent cantons. On an eminence above the town, &s;tands
the principal church, remarkable only for the beautiful
carving in &s;tone round the doors, and ro&s;e window, and for
the delicious pro&s;pect from its terrace. In the cloi&s;ters of the
Recollets is a capital picture attributed to Luvino: their
church is hand&s;ome, and the &s;kreen is ornamented with
the painting of the Pa&s;&s;ion by the &s;ame ma&s;ter. The palace
of the Marquis de Riva contains a few good pictures.</P>
<P>WE then embarked upon the lake of Lugano<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The lake of Lugano is about 190 feet perpendicular higher than the lake of Como and Lago Maggiore. The two la&s;t-mentioned lakes are of the &s;ame level, and about 2$0 feet higher than the city of Milan. <HI>Veri &s;to$ia di Milan,</HI> p. 5. <HI>Abb. Fri&s;t Dei Camali Navig. di Lombardia.</HI> 4to. p. 465.</NOTE>, which is
about twenty-five miles in length, and from two to four in
breadth; its form is irregular and bending into continued
&s;inuo&s;ities. The town forms a fine object, backed by the
<PB N="424" REF="439">
amphitheatre of hills; the banks on each &s;ide bordered with
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of gardens and villas. After being rowed to &s;ee
the noble branch pointing northward, we cro&s;&s;ed to the
Cantine, and continued our voyage under the precipitous
rocks, who&s;e ba&s;es are lo&s;t in the depths of the lake. We
landed at Porto, a &s;mall village in the duchy of Milan,
&s;ituated at its &s;outhern extremity. From this point, an arm
of the lake points northward, and di&s;charges it&s;elf into the
Lago Maggiore, by means of the river Tri&s;a. It is &s;carcely
po&s;&s;ible to imagine a more perfect or greater variety of
beauties than this noble piece of water affords; the va&s;t
over-hanging woods, the bold precipices, the tran&s;parency of
the water, unite to form a &s;cenery in the highe&s;t degree
luxuriant. From Porto the traveller may ob&s;erve, with &s;a|tisfaction
mingled with compa&s;&s;ion, the &s;trong contra&s;ts
effected by the influence of a free and of an arbitrary go|vernment:
the borders of the lake &s;ubject to Switzerland
&s;tudded with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of villages, hou&s;es, and gardens;
this part of the Milane&s;e de&s;olate, and almo&s;t unpeopled.</P>
<P>ON leaving Porto, the hills begin to dimini&s;h, and in the
cour&s;e of three miles are totally lo&s;t in the rich plain of
Lombardy. Vare&s;e is entirely compo&s;ed of the &s;eats of the
Milane&s;e nobility. The principal palazzo is the re&s;idence
of the dutche&s;s dowager of Modena; the gardens are laid
out in the old ta&s;te, the artificial mount commands a fine
view over a rich flat country, a &s;mall lake, and bounded by
the long chain of Alps. In the magnificent &s;aloon are
&s;ome tolerable portraits of the families of Modena and
<PB N="425" REF="440">
Au&s;tria. The emperor, as duke of Milan, has exerted him|&s;elf
in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of convents; a rich Franci&s;can mona|&s;tery
has fallen a &s;acrifice to his plans of reformation.</P>
<P>THE road from hence to Laveno, a &s;mall burgh on the
Lago Maggiore, is varied, and the country very rich; to
the right, on an eminence, is San Sacramento; to the left
we pa&s;&s;ed near &s;ome le&s;&s;er lakes. From Laveno we were
rowed acro&s;s the delightful pa&s;&s;age to I&s;ola Bella, one of the
famous enchanted i&s;lands &s;o particularly de&s;cribed, and with
&s;uch plea&s;ure, by Bi&s;hop Burnet and Key&s;ler; the latter can
compare it to nothing but &startq;<HI>a pyramid of &s;weetmeats, orna|mented
with green fe&s;toons and flowers.&endq;</HI> But as the ta&s;te of
mankind alters with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, I therefore
con&s;idered it only as a monument of expence and folly:
terrace ri&s;es above terrace in regular gradations, bordered
with flower-pots, or gigantic &s;tatues of hor&s;es, gods, and
godde&s;&s;es. The whole is rai&s;ed upon arches; and the &s;oil
has been brought from the &s;hore to cover them. The
palace is magnificent, and contains a profu&s;ion of marbles
and paintings: the lower part of the hou&s;e overhangs the
lake on one &s;ide; where &s;everal apartments are furni&s;hed
in the &s;tile of grottos; the floors, pillars, and walls, are
inlaid with various-coloured &s;tones, marbles, and &s;hells;
the view and the coolne&s;s united make this part a delicious
&s;ummer retreat.</P>
<P>IF any thing ju&s;tly gives this i&s;land the appellation of
enchanted, it is the pro&s;pect from the terrace. The gradual
diminution of the mountains from the regions of eternal
<PB N="426" REF="441">
&s;now to the rich plain, the &s;inuo&s;ity of the lake, its varied
banks, the bay of Marzozzo bounded by va&s;t hills, the
neighbouring burgh of Palanza, and more di&s;tant view of
Laveno, the numerous villages, the I&s;ola Madre, on which
is a palace of the Borromean family, and another i&s;land
&s;prinkled with fi&s;hermen's huts, form a delightful a&s;&s;em|blage.
The&s;e i&s;lands, and the whole we&s;tern coa&s;t of the
lake to the bailliage of Locarno, was ceded to the king of
Sardinia, by the late empre&s;s queen, at the treaty of Worms,
in con&s;ideration of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which &s;he had received
from that monarch.</P>
<P>WE re-entered our boat, troubled by the importunities
of the beggars, who&s;e mi&s;erable huts adjoining to the palace
di&s;grace the i&s;land. Belgeritta is a neat village, containing
&s;ome excellent hou&s;es, and a hand&s;ome church. From
thence we continued our voyage down the lake. The tract
of country to our right, from near Palanza to ten miles
&s;outh of Arona, pays a &s;mall contribution to the Borromean
family for &s;eignorial rights. That family receives a toll for
the merchandize which pa&s;&s;es, grants the privilege of
fi&s;hing, and appoints eleven judges in the re&s;pective vil|lages;
but an appeal lies from their deci&s;ion to a &s;uperior,
nominated by the king of Sardinia, and re&s;ident at Palanza,
and again to Turin. The riches of this opulent hou&s;e are
now increa&s;ing from the product of the gold mines, which
lie among&s;t the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible parts of the mountains,
thirty miles from Margozzo. Above Arona is a &s;eminary
for forty boys, founded by San Carlo Borromeo; near it is
the colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue of that &s;aint, &s;ixty feet in height, placed
<PB N="427" REF="442">
on a pede&s;tal of ju&s;t proportions. He is repre&s;ented in his
cardinal's habit; the right hand extended, a book under the
left arm. The &s;tatue is of bronze, was ca&s;t at Milan, and
brought in &s;eparate pieces. San Carlo, nephew to Pope
Pius the Fourth, was born near this &s;pot; he pa&s;&s;ed with
early credit through his &s;tudies, and the dignities of the
church; was made a cardinal, and archbi&s;hop of Milan.
His charity and pious exertions, during the plague which
ravaged his dioce&s;e, the &s;ubject of &s;o many fine pictures at
Milan, in&s;ure him more general renown than his canon|ization
in 1610.</P>
<P>ARONA is a &s;mall town, with a neat port; above it ri&s;es a
ruined ca&s;tle, which, in the earlier part of the Milane&s;e hi&s;|tory,
&s;eems to have been con&s;idered as a place of the utmo&s;t
importance; at the period when the great conte&s;ts aro&s;e
between the families of Vi&s;conti and Torriani, this ca&s;tle was
the perpetual object of capture and repri&s;al. Otho Vi&s;conti,
the archbi&s;hop, who at length gained the a&s;cendancy, was
twice repul&s;ed and driven from hence. Two promontories
project into the lake at this &s;pot; the ea&s;tern is crowned
with the ca&s;tle of Anghiera, which gives name to this valua|ble
province, which in 1397, to gratify Galeazzo, the &s;econd
duke of Milan, was erected into a county by the emperor
Wence&s;laus, and has &s;ince been transferred to the king of
Sardinia. On doubling the promontory of Arona, the lake
again enlarges, and forms a bay; the banks are very low.
Soon after entering the Te&s;ino we landed at the dirty village
of Se&s;to; hired another boat, and were hurried with great
rapidity down that river, between high banks of gravel, to
<PB N="428" REF="443">
the commencement of the <HI>Naviglio Grande,</HI> the great canal
which forms the junction between the Po and the Adda,
calculated not le&s;s for conveying merchandize and wood
to Milan, than for benefiting the neighbouring country
with partial inundations, and for the purpo&s;e of laying the
rice fields under water. Its breadth at fir&s;t is great; but
narrows as we advance, and the &s;tream becomes almo&s;t a
dead water<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">According to the Abb&eacute; Fri&s;i, the length of the Naviglio is 86, 000 braccia, or 14 Italian miles (60 to a degree); its breadth at the entrance 70, which gradually dimi|ni&s;hes to 20; and the perpendicular height of the fall of water is 58; at fir&s;t 5 brac|cia per mile, gradually decrea&s;ing for the fir&s;t twelve miles, until it is no more than one braccin is a mile; then increa&s;ing for the five next miles to a little more than five braccia in a mile.&mdash;See <HI>Canal.

<P>IF bad weather and other circum&s;tances had not pre|vented
me from extending my tour, I had purpo&s;ed vi&s;iting
the bay of Margozzo, Domo, d'O&s;cella, Varallo, and the gold
mines in its neighbourhood; an excur&s;ion, which, from
the reports I have heard, could not fail of affording the

in her great features.</P>

and other Authors.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="445">
IN no part of Europe does nature invite the naturali&s;t with attractions
&s;tronger than in Switzerland; a country &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed,
by &s;ublime alps, &s;tupendous glaciers, beautiful mountains, vallies,
and lakes, and affording a mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive &s;cope for variety, in
the vegetable world, in the mineral kingdom, and in animal life;
nor have the ingenious and learned of this nation neglected to avail
them&s;elves of their peculiar &s;ituation. Let the genius of the
Ge&s;ners, the names of Haller, of Sau&s;&s;ure, and many others, bear
te&s;timony to this truth. Neverthele&s;s, of the&s;e various branches of
knowledge, Zoology &s;eems to have made le&s;s progre&s;s among this
ingenious people, than any other natural &s;cience, if compared with
its advancement in &s;everal other parts of Europe; &s;ince there is yet
no complete <HI>Fauna,</HI> or de&s;cription of the animals of this country.
It is true, the writings of the indefatigable Conrad Ge&s;ner, contain
a great number of valuable ob&s;ervations on the animals of Switzer|land;
but &s;o diffu&s;ed throughout his works, that they are of little
u&s;e to &s;uch as wi&s;h for a connected view of its animal productions.
Neither can the &s;canty and vague accounts of Wagner, gratify the
accuracy of the modern zoologi&s;t. The indu&s;try, however, and in|genuity
of &s;everal naturali&s;ts, have been of late employed in accurate
inve&s;tigations of the re&s;pective parts of Switzerland regarding the
animal kingdom; and their kindne&s;s has enabled me to lay before
the Engli&s;h naturali&s;t the following <HI>Faunula Helvetica.</HI></P>
<P>THE reader is, however, originally indebted to Thomas Pen|nant,
E&s;&abque; for this catalogue. That ingenious naturali&s;t, having
communicated to me a li&s;t of the Swi&s;s birds drawn from Mr.
<PB N="431" REF="446">
Sprungli's<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Letter 58.</NOTE> much-admired cabinet, advi&s;ed me to obtain from the
collector him&s;elf an account of &s;uch additional birds as he had pro|cured
&s;ince 1776, the year in which Mr. Pennant vi&s;ited Switzer|land.
I accordingly applied to Mr. Sprungli, who obligingly gave
me an accurate catalogue of the Swi&s;s birds and fi&s;hes, drawn up in
the Linnaean method, illu&s;trated with ob&s;ervations and remarks.
On returning from my travels, Mr. Pennant, at my reque&s;t, fa|voured
me with the Engli&s;h names of the &s;aid birds, and with re|ferences
to the Briti&s;h Zoology, Linnaeus, and Bri&s;&s;on, which are
pre&s;erved in the following catalogue. On a &s;ub&s;equent expedition
to Switzerland in 1786, I endeavoured to obtain a catalogue of the
quadrupeds and amphibia, for the purpo&s;e of forming a <HI>Faunula
Helvetica,</HI> a great de&s;ideratum in the natural hi&s;tory of Switzer|land.</P>
<P>FROM the Rev. Mr. Wyttenbach<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 59.</NOTE>, the &s;ame gentleman to
whom I was already indebted for a de&s;cription of the Alps and hills
&s;een from Berne, I received a li&s;t of the quadrupeds and amphibia;
and from M. Van Berchem<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letter 41.</NOTE>, of Lau&s;anne, whom I have men|tioned
in my account of the bouquetin, a catalogue of the fi&s;hes
found in the lake of Neuchatel, and of the amphibia, which agreed
with tho&s;e communicated to me by Mr. Wyttenbach.</P>
<P>To the obliging communication of Mr. Studer, mini&s;ter of the
great ho&s;pital at Berne, I owe the remaining part of this <HI>Faunula.</HI>
As no marine &s;pecies of &s;hells could enter into this li&s;t, it will be
an ample proof of the diligence and ingenuity of the collector,
that his cabinet actually contains all the land and fre&s;h-water
&s;hells here enumerated; among which are many totally unnoticed
by former writers. Mr. Studer, having collected all the&s;e &s;pecies
<PB N="432" REF="447">
in the recent &s;tate, with a view to de&s;cribe the animal, as well as its
covering, was hence led to arrange them, not by the &s;y&s;tem of
Linnaeus, which is adapted rather to the &s;hell than to its inhabitant,
but by that of the late learned and indefatigable Mr. Muller, pub|li&s;hed
under the following title, &startq;<HI>Vermium terre&s;trium, et fluviati|lium
&s;eu Animalium infu&s;oriorum, Helminthicorum, et Te&s;taceorum,
non marinorum, &s;uccincta Hi&s;toria. Auctore Oth. Frid.</HI> MUL|LER.
Hauniae &amp; Lip&s;. 1773. 4&deg;.&endq; The French names he has
taken from M. Geoffroy's work &startq;on the Te&s;taceous Animals of
the Environs of Paris;&endq; the German, from the Berlin Magazine
conducted by Dr. Martini, and from the works of Mr. Schroeter.
To the new &s;pecies he has him&s;elf given trivial names; and
propo&s;es &s;hortly to publi&s;h an ample de&s;cription of his cabinet.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Faunula,</HI> in the order in which it now &s;tands, was ar|ranged
and dige&s;ted by Dr. Pulteney, who collected the Engli&s;h
names, and references to Linnaeus, Pennant, and Bri&s;&s;on, in the ca|talogues
of the quadrupeds and amphibia. He al&s;o &s;ubjoined to the
li&s;t of birds &s;everal references and illu&s;trations, in addition to tho&s;e
communicated by Mr. Pennant; and Mr. Sprungli, having reviewed
the birds and fi&s;h &s;ince the&s;e additions were made, has expre&s;&s;ed his
entire approbation of them. I cannot conclude without gratefully
expre&s;&s;ing my obligation to tho&s;e gentlemen, who have thus en|abled
me to give the fir&s;t connected, though brief, account of
the Swi&s;s Zoology.</P>

<ITEM><P>This bird frequents the Pennine, Rhaetian, and Tyrole&s;e Alps. It
is found al&s;o in Cor&s;ica, Sardinia, and probably in Barbary, as well as
on mount Cauca&s;us and in Dauria, or the &s;outh-ea&s;tern parts of Si|beria.
It connects the Vultures with the Eagles. In the form of
the beak and of the body it re&s;embles the Vulture, but differs from
that genus in having the head, like that of the Eagles, covered with
feathers. It is now &s;o well defined, e&s;pecially by M. Sprungli, that
it can no longer be mi&s;taken<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Letter 58.</NOTE>. The German pea&s;ants of Switzer|land
name this bird, by way of eminence, the <HI>Lammer-geyer,</HI> and re|late
incredible tales of its &s;ize and voraciou&s;ne&s;s: The pea&s;ants of the
French di&s;trict frequently call it <HI>Le Vautour Jaune.</HI></P></ITEM>

<P>IUSED my utmo&s;t endeavours to render the General Map of Switzerland,
which accompanies this work, as complete as po&s;&s;ible; and as there was no
accurate delineation of the whole country yet given to the public, I collected the
be&s;t maps of the various parts of Switzerland, which I was able to procure.
From the&s;e authorities, which are here enumerated, Me&s;&s;rs. Palmer and Baker
compiled the pre&s;ent engraving; and to their merit the public is indebted for
what, I hope, will be deemed the be&s;t general map of Switzerland yet extant.</P>

Four Tours through Switzerland, in 1776, 1779, 1785, and 1786;
With the Di&s;tances marked in leagues and Engli&s;h miles.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to appri&s;e the traveller, that although I &s;pared no pains
in order to a&s;certain the re&s;pective di&s;tances, yet in many places, and parti|cularly
in the mountainous di&s;tricts, it was impo&s;&s;ible to obtain that degree of
accuracy which I could have de&s;ired. For in tho&s;e parts, the di&s;tances being
not mea&s;ured, can only be conjectured from the time employed in tra|ver&s;ing
them.</P>
