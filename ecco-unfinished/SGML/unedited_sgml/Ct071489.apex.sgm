A LETTER FROM A GENTLEMAN IN THE Engli&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, IN VINDICATION OF HIS CONDUCT, WITH REGARD TO THE AFFAIRS OF IRELAND, ADDRESSED TO A Member of the Iri&s;h Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following letter, which is handed about in manu&s;cript in <HI>Dublin,</HI> as the production of one of the fir&s;t genui&s;es of that or any other country, is intended as a vindication of his conduct in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament relative to the affairs of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The &s;tyle alone will be &s;ufficient to prove it genuine. It may be nece&s;&s;ary, perhaps, to apologize to the author, for making public what had been only privately communicated. In common with his countrymen, the gentle|man, who gives this letter to the public, cen&s;ured a conduct which this letter has taught him to think prai&s;e-worthy: he wi&s;hes the world at large to receive the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions with him&s;elf, and to view the character of the mo&s;t amiable man of the pre&s;ent times, as much above the narrow views of faction or party, as his literary talents exceed tho&s;e of his enemies or de|famers.
<PB N="6" REF="4">
And he hopes he does a &s;ervice to the world, by re&s;cuing from ob&s;curity a compo&s;ition to which the public have &s;o ju&s;t a claim; and he tru&s;ts that the gentleman to whom this letter was addre&s;&s;ed, will not think him&s;elf u&s;ed hardly by the divulging tho&s;e &s;entiments to which the public have a claim, in preference of any private indi|vidual however re&s;pectable.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Don't know in what manner I am to thank you properly for the very friendly &s;olicitude you have been &s;o good as to expre&s;s for my reputation. The con|cern you have done me the honour to take in my affairs, will be an ample in|demnity for all that I may &s;uffer from the rapid judgments of tho&s;e who choo&s;e to form their opinions of men, not from the life, but from their portraits in a
<PB N="8" REF="6">
news-paper. I confe&s;s to you, that my frame of mind is &s;o contracted, I have in me &s;o little of the con&s;titution of a great man, that I am more gratified with a very moderate &s;hare of approbation from tho&s;e few who know me, than I &s;hould be with the mo&s;t clamorous applau&s;e from the multitudes who love to admire at a due di&s;tance. I am not, however, &s;toic enough to be able to affirm with truth, or hypocrite enough affectedly to pretend, that I am wholly unmoved at the difficulty which you and other of my friends in Ireland have found in vindi|cating my conduct towards my native country: it undoubtedly hurts me in &s;ome degree; but the wound is not very deep. If I had &s;ought popularity in Ireland, when, in the cau&s;e of that country, I was ready to &s;acrifice, and did &s;acrifice, a much nearer, a much more immediate, and a much more advantageous popu|larity here, I &s;hould find my&s;elf per|fectly
<PB N="9" REF="7">
unhappy, becau&s;e I &s;hould be totally di&s;appointed in my expectations; becau&s;e I &s;hould di&s;cover, when it was too late, what common-&s;en&s;e might have told me very early, that I ri&s;qued the capital of my fame in the mo&s;t di&s;ad|vantageous lottery in the world. But I acted then, as I act now, and I hope I &s;hall act always, from a &s;trong impul&s;e of right, and from motives in which popularity, either here, or there, has but a very little part: with the &s;upport of that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, I can bear a good deal of the coquettry of publick opinion; which has her caprices and mu&s;t have her ways. <HI>Mi&s;eri quibus intentata nitet.</HI> I, too, have had my holiday of popularity in <HI>Ireland;</HI> I have even heard of an intention to erect a &s;tatue. I believe my intimate ac|quaintance know how little that idea was encouraged by me; and I was &s;in|cerely glad that it never took effect. Such honours belong exclu&s;ively to the
<PB N="10" REF="8">
tomb, the natural and only period of human incon&s;tancy, with regard either to de&s;ert or to opinion; for they are the very &s;ame hands which erect, that very frequently (and &s;ometimes with rea&s;on enough) pluck down the &s;tatue. Had &s;uch an unmerited and unlooked-for compliment been paid to me two years ago, the pavements of the piece might at this hour have the advantage of &s;eeing actual &s;ervice, while they were moving, according to the law of projectiles, to the windows of the A&mdash;y G&mdash;l, or of my old friend <HI>M&mdash;k M&mdash;n.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;peak &s;eriou&s;ly, let me a&s;&s;ure you, my dear Sir, that, though I am not per|mitted to rejoice at all its effects, there is not one man at your &s;ide of the water more plea&s;ed to &s;ee the &s;ituation of <HI>Ire|land</HI> &s;o pro&s;perous, as that &s;he can afford to throw away her friends. She has ob|tained &s;olely by her own efforts the fruits
<PB N="11" REF="9">
of a great victory, which I am very ready to allow that the be&s;t efforts of her be&s;t well-wi&s;hers here could not have done for her &s;o effectually in a great number of years, and perhaps could not have done at all. I could wi&s;h, however, merely for the &s;ake of her own dignity, that, in turning her poor relations and antiquated friends out of doors, (though one of the mo&s;t common effects of new pro&s;perity,) &s;he had thought proper to di&s;mi&s;s us with fewer tokens of unkind|ne&s;s. It is true, that there is no &s;ort of danger in affronting men who are not of importance enough to have any tru&s;t of mini&s;terial, of royal, or of national ho|nour to &s;urrender. The unforced and unbought &s;ervices of humble men, who have no medium of influence in great a&s;&s;emblies, but through the precarious force of rea&s;on, mu&s;t be looked upon with contempt, by tho&s;e who, by their wi&s;dom and &s;pirit, have improved the
<PB N="12" REF="10">
critical moment of their fortune, and have debated with authority again&s;t pu|&s;illanimous di&s;&s;ent and ungracious com|pliance, at the head of forty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>Such feeble auxiliaries (as I talk of) to &s;uch a force employed again&s;t &s;uch re|&s;i&s;tance, I mu&s;t own, in the pre&s;ent mo|ment, very little worthy of your atten|tion; yet, if one were to look forward, it &s;carcely &s;eems altogether politick to be|&s;tow &s;o much liberality of invective on the Whiggs of this kingdom, as I find it has been the fa&s;hion to do both in and out of parliament. That you &s;hould pay compliments in &s;ome tone or other, whe|ther ironical or &s;erious, to the mini&s;ter from who&s;e imbecillity you have extorted what you could never obtain from his bounty, is not unnatural in the fir&s;t ef|fu&s;ions of parliamentary gratitude to that mini&s;ter, for the early and voluntary be|nefits
<PB N="13" REF="11">
he has conferred upon Ireland. It might appear that you were wanting to the triumph of his &s;urrender, if you did not lead &s;ome of his enemies captive be|fore him; neither could you fea&s;t him with decorum, if his particular ta&s;te were not con&s;ulted. A mini&s;ter who has never defended his mea&s;ures in any other way than by railing at his adver&s;aries, cannot have his palate made all at once to the reli&s;h of po&s;itive commendation. I can|not deny but that on this occa&s;ion there was di&s;played a great deal of the good breeding, which con&s;i&s;ts in the accom|modation of the entertainment to the re|li&s;h of the gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>But that ceremony being pa&s;t, it would not be unworthy of the wi&s;dom of Ire|land, to con&s;ider what con&s;equences the extingui&s;hing every &s;park of freedom in this country may have upon your own li|berties. You are at this in&s;tant flu&s;hed with
<PB N="14" REF="12">
victory, and full of the confidence natu|ral to recent and untried power. We are in a temper equally natural, though very different:&mdash;We feel as men do, who, hav|ing placed an unbounded reliance on their force, have found it totally to fail on trial:&mdash;We feel faint and heartle&s;s, and without the &s;malle&s;t degree of &s;elf-opi|nion:&mdash;in plain words, we are <HI>cowed.</HI> When men give up their violence and in|ju&s;tice without a &s;truggle, their condi|tion is next to de&s;perate. Where no art, no management is nece&s;&s;ary to abate their pride, and overcome their prejudices; and their unea&s;ine&s;s only excites an ob|&s;cure and feeble rattling in their throat; their final di&s;&s;olution &s;eems not far off. In this mi&s;erable &s;tate we are &s;till further depre&s;&s;ed by the over-bearing influence of the crown: it acts with the officious cruelty of a mercenary nur&s;e, who, un|der pretence of tenderne&s;s, &s;tifles us with our clothes, and plucks the pillow from our heads. <HI>Injectu multae ve&s;tis opprimi</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="13">
<HI>&s;enem jubet.</HI> Under this influence, we have &s;o little will of our own, that, even in any apparent activity we may be got to a&s;&s;ume, I may &s;ay, without any vio|lence to &s;en&s;e, and with very little to language, we are merely pa&s;&s;ive. We have yielded to your demands this &s;e&s;&s;ion; in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion we refu&s;ed to prevent them. In both ca&s;es, the pa&s;&s;ive and the active, our principle was the &s;ame. Had the crown plea&s;ed to retain the &s;pirit with regard to Ireland, which &s;eems to be now all directed to America, we &s;hould have neglected our own immediate de|fence, and &s;ent over the la&s;t man of our militia, to fight with the la&s;t man of your volunteers.</P>
<P>To this influence, the principle of ac|tion, the principle of policy, and the principle of union of the pre&s;ent mino|rity, are oppo&s;ed. The&s;e principles of the oppo&s;ition are the only thing which pre|&s;erves
<PB N="16" REF="14">
a &s;ingle &s;ymptom of life in the na|tion. That oppo&s;ition is compo&s;ed of the far greater part of the independent pro|perty and independent rank in the king|dom, of whatever is mo&s;t untainted in character, of whatever ability remains unextingui&s;hed in the people; and all which tends to draw the attention of fo|reign countries upon this. It is now in its final and conclu&s;ive &s;truggle: it has to &s;truggle again&s;t a force to which, I am afraid, it is not equal. The whole king|dom of Scotland ranges with the venal, the unprincipled, and the wrong prin|cipled of this; and if the kingdom of Ireland thinks proper to pa&s;s into the &s;ame camp, we &s;hall certainly be obliged to quit the field. In that ca&s;e, if I know any-thing of this country, another con|&s;titutional oppo&s;ition can never be formed on it: and, if this be impo&s;&s;ible, it will be at lea&s;t as much &s;o (if there can be degrees in impo&s;&s;ibility) to have a con&s;ti|tutional
<PB N="17" REF="15">
admini&s;tration at any future time. The po&s;&s;ibility of the former is the only &s;ecurity for the exi&s;tence of the latter. Whether the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration be in the lea&s;t like one, I mu&s;t venture to doubt, even in the honey-moon of the Iri&s;h fondne&s;s to Lord North, which has &s;ucceeded to all their &s;lapping and &s;cratching.</P>
<P>If liberty cannot maintain its ground in this kingdom, I am &s;ure that it can|not have any long continuance in yours. Our liberty might now and then jar and &s;trike a di&s;cord with that of Ireland; the thing is po&s;&s;ible; but &s;till the in&s;truments might play in concert: but, if ours be un&s;trung, yours will be hung up on a peg, and both will be mute for ever. Your new military force may give you confidence; and it &s;erves for a turn: but you and I know that it has no root;
<PB N="18" REF="16">
it is not perennial, and would prove but a poor &s;helter for your liberty, when this nation, having no intere&s;t in its own, could only look upon yours with the eyes of envy and di&s;gu&s;t. I cannot, therefore, help thinking, and telling you what, with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion I think, that, if the Parliament of Ireland be &s;o zeal|ous of the &s;pirit of our common con&s;ti|tution as &s;he &s;eems to be, it was not &s;o di&s;creet to mix with the panegyrick on the mini&s;ter &s;o large a portion of acri|mony to the independent part of this na|tion. You never received any &s;ort of in|jury from them, and you are grown to that degree of importance, that the di&s;|cour&s;es in your parliament will have a much greater effect on our immediate fortune, than our conver&s;ation can have upon yours:&mdash;in the end they will &s;eri|ou&s;ly affect both.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="17">
I have looked back upon our conduct, and our public conver&s;ations, in order to di&s;cover what it is that can have given you offence. I have done &s;o, becau&s;e I am ready to admit, that to offend you without cau&s;e, would be as contrary to true policy, as, I am &s;ure, it mu&s;t be to the inclinations of almo&s;t every one of us.&mdash;About two years ago Lord Nugent moved &s;ix propo&s;itions in favour of Ire|land, in the Hou&s;e of Commons. At the time of the motions, and during the de|bate, Lord North was either wholly out of the hou&s;e, or engaged in other mat|ters of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;antry. In the remote&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the We&s;t-Saxon corner, he took no part what&s;oever in the affair; But it was &s;uppo&s;ed his neutra|lity was more inclined towards the &s;ide of favour. The mover being a per&s;on in office, was, however, the only indi|cation that was given of &s;uch a leaning.
<PB N="20" REF="18">
We, who &s;upported the propo&s;itions, finding them better reli&s;hed than at fir&s;t we looked for, pur&s;ued our advantage, and began to open a way for more e&s;&s;en|tial benefits to Ireland: on the other hand, tho&s;e who had hitherto oppo&s;ed them in vain, redoubled their efforts, and became exceedingly clamorous. Then it was, that Lord North found it nece&s;&s;ary to come out of his fa&s;tne&s;s, and to in|terpo&s;e between the contending parties. In this character of mediator, he de|clared, that, if any thing beyond the fir&s;t &s;ix re&s;olutions &s;hould be attempted, he would oppo&s;e the whole; but that, if we re&s;ted there, the original motions &s;hould have his &s;upport. On this a &s;ort of conver&s;ation took place between him and the managers of the Iri&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s, in which the &s;ix re&s;olutions were to be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis,</HI> and to be held &s;acred.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19">
By this time other parties began to ap|pear: a good many of the trading towns and manufactures of various kinds took the alarm; petitions crowded in upon one another; and the bar was occupied by a formidable body of council. Lord North was &s;taggered by this new bat|tery. He is not of a con&s;titution to en|counter &s;uch an oppo&s;ition as had then ri&s;en, when there were no other objects in view than tho&s;e that were then before the hou&s;e. In order not to lo&s;e him, we were obliged to abandon, bit by bit, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable parts of the original agreement.</P>
<P>In &s;everal parts, however, he continued fair and firm. For my own part, I acted, as I tru&s;t I commonly do, with deci&s;ion; I &s;aw very well, that the things we had got were of no great con&s;ideration; but they were, even in their defects, &s;ome|what leading. I was in hopes that we
<PB N="22" REF="20">
might obtain gradually, and by parts, what we might attempt at once, and in the whole, without &s;ucce&s;s; that one con|ce&s;&s;ion would lead another; and that the people of England di&s;covering, by a progre&s;&s;ive experience, that none of the conce&s;&s;ions actually made were followed by the con&s;equences they had dreaded, their fears from what they were yet to yield would con&s;iderably dimini&s;h. But that to which I attached my&s;elf the mo&s;t particul&aacute;rly was, to fix the principle of a free trade in all the ports of the&s;e i&s;lands, as founded in ju&s;tice, and beneficial to the whole, but principally to this the &s;eat of the &s;upreme power; and this I labour|ed to the utmo&s;t of my might, upon general principles, illu&s;trated by all the commercial detail with which my little enquiries in life were able to furni&s;h me. I ought to forget &s;uch trifling things as tho&s;e which concern my&s;elf; and, po&s;|&s;ibly,
<PB N="23" REF="21">
I might have forgotten them, if the Lord Advocate of Scotland had not, in a very flattering manner, revived them in my memory, in a full hou&s;e, in this &s;e&s;&s;ion. He told me, that my argu|ments, &s;uch as they were, made him change the opinion with which he had come into the hou&s;e &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed. I am &s;ure, that, at the time, at lea&s;t twenty more told me the &s;ame thing. I certainly ought not to take their &s;tyle of compliment as a te&s;timony to fact; neither do I: but all this &s;hewed &s;uf|ficiently, not what they thought of my ability, but what they &s;aw of my zeal. I could &s;ay more in proof of the effects of that zeal, and of the uncea&s;ing in|du&s;try with which I then acted, both in my endeavours which were apparent, and tho&s;e that were not &s;o vi&s;ible. Let it be remembered I &s;hewed tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions while the parliament of England was in
<PB N="24" REF="22">
a capacity to deliberate, and in a &s;ituation to refu&s;e; when there was &s;omething to be ri&s;qued here, by being &s;u&s;pected of a partiality to Ireland; when there was an honourable danger attending the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of friend&s;hip to you, which heightened its reli&s;h, and made it worthy of a reception in manly minds: But, as for the awkward and nau&s;eous parade of debate without oppo&s;ition, the flim&s;y device of tricking out nece&s;&s;ity, and di&s;|gui&s;ing it in the habit of choice, the &s;hal|low &s;tratagem of defending by argument what all the world mu&s;t perceive is yielded to force; the&s;e are a &s;ort of acts of friend&s;hip, which I am &s;orry that any of my countrymen &s;hould require of their real friends: they are things not to my ta&s;te; and, if they are looked upon as te&s;ts of friend&s;hip, I de&s;ire for one, that I may be con&s;idered as an enemy.&mdash;What party-purpo&s;e did my conduct
<PB N="25" REF="23">
an&s;wer at that time? I acted with Lord North; I went to all the mini&s;terial meetings: and he and his a&s;&s;ociates in office will do me the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that, aiming at the concord of the empire, I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to give her con|ce&s;&s;ions all the value of which they were capable; whil&s;t &s;ome of tho&s;e who were covered with his favours, derogated from them, treated them with contempt, and openly threatened to oppo&s;e them. If I had acted with my deare&s;t and mo&s;t valued friends; if I had acted with the Marquis of Rockingham, or the Duke of Richmond, in that &s;ituation; I could not have attended more to their honour, or endeavoured more earne&s;tly to give efficacy to the mea&s;ures I had taken in common with them. The return which I, and all who acted as I did, have met with from him, does not make me re|pent the conduct which I there held.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="24">
As to the re&s;t of the gentlemen with whom I have the honour to act, they did not then, or at any other time, make a party-affair of Iri&s;h politicks. That matter was always taken up without concert, but in general from the opera|tion of our known liberal principles in government, in commerce, in religion, in every thing: it was taken up favourably for Ireland, where &s;ome local intere&s;ts bore hard upon the members. They acted on the &s;en&s;e of their con&s;tituents; upon ideas, which, though I do not al|ways follow, I can never blame: how|ever, two or three per&s;ons, high in oppo|&s;ition, and high in publick e&s;teem, ran great ri&s;ks in their boroughs on the occa|&s;ion. But all this was without any par|ticular plan. I need not &s;ay, that Ireland was, in that affair, much obliged to the liberal mind and enlarged under&s;tanding of Charles Fox. Mr. Town&s;hend, Lord
<PB N="27" REF="25">
Middleton, and others, likewi&s;e, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves. On reviewing the whole of that affair, which gave ri&s;e to all the &s;ub&s;equent manoeuvres, I am con|vinced, that the whole of what has this day been done, might have been at that time effected; but then the mi|ni&s;ter mu&s;t have taken it up as a great plan of national policy, and paid with his per&s;on in every lodgment of his ap|proach. He mu&s;t have u&s;ed that in|fluence to quiet prejudice, which he has &s;o often u&s;ed to corrupt principle; and I know that, if he had, he mu&s;t have &s;ucceeded. Many of the mo&s;t active in oppo&s;ition would have given him an un|equivocal &s;upport. The corporation of London, and the great body of the London We&s;t-India Merchants and Planters, which forms the greate&s;t ma&s;s of that va&s;t intere&s;t, were di&s;po&s;ed to fall in with &s;uch a plan; they con&s;tantly
<PB N="28" REF="26">
gave no &s;ort of di&s;countenance to what was done, or what was propo&s;ed. But the&s;e are not the kind of objects for which our mini&s;ters bring out the heavy artillery of the &s;tate; therefore, as tho&s;e things &s;tood at that time, a great deal more was not practicable.&mdash;La&s;t year, an|other propo&s;ition was brought for the re|lief of Ireland; it was &s;tarted without any communication with a &s;ingle per&s;on of activity in the country party, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, without any kind of con|cert with government: it appeared to me extremely raw and indige&s;ted. The behaviour of Lord North on the opening of that bu&s;ine&s;s was the exact tran&s;cript of his conduct on the Iri&s;h que&s;tion of the former &s;e&s;&s;ion: it was a mode of pro|ceeding, which his nature has wrought into the texture of his politicks, and which is in&s;eparable from them. He cho&s;e to ab&s;ent him&s;elf on the propo&s;ition, and
<PB N="29" REF="27">
during the agitation of that bu&s;ine&s;s, al|though the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e is that alone for which he has any kind of reli&s;h, or, as I am told, can be per&s;uaded to li&s;ten to with any degree of attention: but he was willing to let it take its cour&s;e. If it &s;hould pa&s;s without any con&s;iderable difficulty, he would bring his acquie&s;cence to tell for merit in Ireland; and he would have the credit, out of his indolence, of giving quiet to that country. If diffi|culties &s;hould ari&s;e on the part of Eng|land, he knew that the hou&s;e was &s;o well trained, that he might at his plea&s;ure call us from the hotte&s;t &s;cent. As he acted in his u&s;ual manner, and up|on his u&s;ual principles, oppo&s;ition acted upon theirs, and rather generally &s;up|ported the mea&s;ure. As to my&s;elf, I expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;approbation at the prac|tice of bringing imperfected and undi|ge&s;ted projects into the hou&s;e, before
<PB N="30" REF="28">
means were u&s;ed to quiet the clamours which a mi&s;conception of what we were doing might occa&s;ion at home, and be|fore mea&s;ures were &s;ettled with men of weight and authority in Ireland, in order to render our acts u&s;eful and acceptable to that country. I &s;aid, that the only thing which could make the influence of the crown (enormous without as well as within the hou&s;e) in any degree to|lerable, was, that it might be employed to give &s;omething of order and &s;y&s;tem to the proceedings of a popular a&s;&s;em|bly; that government being &s;o &s;ituated as to have a large range of pro&s;pect, and, as it were, a bird-view of every thing, they might &s;ee di&s;tant dangers and di&s;|tant advantages, which were not &s;o vi&s;i|ble to tho&s;e who &s;tood on the common level: they might be&s;ides ob&s;erve, from this advantage, things in their relative and combined &s;tate, which people lo|cally
<PB N="31" REF="29">
in&s;tructed and partially informed could behold only in an in&s;ulated and un|connected manner: but that, for many years pa&s;t, we &s;uffered under all the evils, without any one of the advan|tages, of a government influence; that the bu&s;ine&s;s of mini&s;ters, or of tho&s;e who acted as &s;uch, had been &s;till further to contract the narrowne&s;s of man's ideas, to confirm inveterate prejudices, to in|flame vulgar pa&s;&s;ions, and to abate all &s;orts of popular rights and privileges; &s;o far from methodizing the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e, they had let all things run in|to an inextricable confu&s;ion, and had left affairs of the mo&s;t delicate policy wholly to chance.</P>
<P>After I had expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with the warmth I felt on &s;eeing all order and government bur&s;t under the ruins of li|berty, and after I had made my prote&s;t

again&s;t the infufficiency of the propo&s;i|tions, I &s;upported the principle of en|largement which they aimed at, though &s;hort and &s;omewhat wide of the mark, giving as my &s;ole rea&s;on, that the more frequently tho&s;e matters came into di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, the more it would tend to di&s;pel fears and to eradicate prejudices.</P>
<P>This was the only part I took; the de|tail was in the hands of Lord Newhaven and Lord Beauchamp, with &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from Earl Nugent, and a few in|dependent gentlemen of Iri&s;h property. The dead weight of the mini&s;ter being removed, the hou&s;e recovered its tone and ela&s;ticity. We had a temporary ap|pearance of deliberate character: the bu|&s;ine&s;s was debated freely on both &s;ides, and with &s;ufficient temper; and the &s;en&s;e of the members being influenced by no|thing but what will naturally influence men

unbought, their rea&s;on and their preju|dice: the&s;e two principles had a fair con|flict, and prejudice was obliged to give way to rea&s;on;&mdash;a majority appeared, on a divi&s;ion, in favour of the propo&s;i|tions.</P>
<P>As the&s;e proceedings got out of doors, Gla&s;gow and Manche&s;ter, and I think Liverpool, began to move, but in a man|ner much more &s;low and languid than formerly; and nothing, in my opinion, would have been le&s;s difficult, than en|tirely to have overborne their oppo&s;ition. The London Ea&s;t-India trade was, as on the former occa&s;ion, &s;o on this, perfectly liberal and quiet; and there is abroad &s;o much re&s;pect for the united wi&s;dom of the hou&s;e, when &s;uppo&s;ed to act upon a fair view of political &s;ituation, that I &s;carcely ever remember any con&s;iderable unea&s;ine&s;s out of doors, when the mo&s;t

active members, and tho&s;e of mo&s;t pro|perty and con&s;ideration, in the mino|rity, have joined them&s;elves to the admi|ni&s;tration. Many factious people in the towns mentioned began, indeed, to re|vile Lord North, and to reproach his neutrality as treacherous and ungrateful to tho&s;e who had &s;o heartily and &s;o warmly entered into all his views with regard to America.</P>
<P>That noble Lord, who&s;e decided cha|racter it is to give way to the late&s;t and neare&s;t plea&s;ure, without any &s;ort of regard to di&s;tant con&s;equences of any kind, thought fit to appear, on this &s;ig|nification of the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e his worthy friends and partizans, and, put|ting him&s;elf at the head of the <HI>po&s;&s;e Scac|carii,</HI> wholly regardle&s;s of the dignity and con&s;i&s;tency of our mi&s;erable hou&s;e, drove the propo&s;itions entirely out of

<P>In order to atone to Ireland for this gratification to Manche&s;ter, he graciou&s;ly permitted, or rather forwarded, two bills; that for encouraging the growth of to|bacco, and that for giving a bounty on exportation of hemp from Ireland. They were brought in by two very worthy members, and on good principles: but I was &s;orry to &s;ee them; and, after ex|pre&s;&s;ing my doubts of their propriety, left the hou&s;e. Little el&s;e was &s;aid upon them. My objections were two: the fir&s;t, that the cultivation of tho&s;e weeds (if one of them could be at all cultivated to profit) was adver&s;e to the introduction of a good cour&s;e of agriculture; the other, that the encouragement given to them, tended to e&s;tabli&s;h that mi&s;chie|vous policy of con&s;idering Ireland as a

country of &s;taple, and a producer of raw materials.</P>
<P>When the rejection of the fir&s;t propo|&s;ition, and the acceptance of the la&s;t, had jointly, as it was natural, rai&s;ed a very &s;trong di&s;content in Ireland, Lord Rockingham, who had frequently &s;aid that there never &s;eemed a more oppor|tune time for the relief of Ireland, than that moment when Lord North had re|jected all rational propo&s;itions for its re|lief, without con&s;ulting, I believe, any one living, did what he is not very often wil|ling to do; but he thought this an occa|&s;ion of magnitude enough to ju&s;tify an extraordinary &s;tep :&mdash;he went into the clo&s;et, and made a &s;trong repre&s;entation to the King; which was not ill received, and I believe produced good effects. He then made the motion in the Hou&s;e of Lords which you may recollect; but he
<PB N="37" REF="35">
was content to withdraw it, on the &s;o|lemn promi&s;e of mini&s;try, that they would, in the rece&s;s of parliament, pre|pare a plan for the benefit of Ireland, and have it in readine&s;s to produce the next meeting. You may recollect that Lord Gower became in a particular man|ner bound for the fulfilling this engage|ment. Even this did not &s;atisfy; and mo&s;t of the minority were very unwil|ling that parliament &s;hould be prorogued until &s;omething effectual on the &s;ubject &s;hould be done: particularly as we &s;aw that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, di&s;contents, and arma|ments of Ireland, were encrea&s;ing every day; and we were not &s;o much lo&s;t to common &s;en&s;e, as not to know the wi&s;|dom and efficacy of early conce&s;&s;ion in circum&s;tances &s;uch as ours.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion was now at an end. The mini&s;ters, in&s;tead of attending to a duty

that was &s;o urgent on them, employed them&s;elves, as u&s;ual, in endeavours to de&s;troy the reputation of tho&s;e who were bold enough to remind them of it. They cau&s;ed it to be indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated through the nation, that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Ireland were of a nature hard to be traced to the true &s;ource; that they had been mon&s;trou&s;ly magnified; and that, in par|ticular, the official reports from Ireland had given the lie (that was their plea&s;ure) to Lord Rockingham's repre&s;entations; and, attributing the origin of the Iri&s;h proceedings wholly to us, they a&s;&s;erted that every thing done in parliament upon the &s;ubject was with a view of &s;tirring up rebellion; <Q>&startq;that neither the Iri&s;h le|gi&s;lature, nor their con&s;tituents, had &s;ignified any di&s;&s;atisfaction at the relief obtained (in the &s;e&s;&s;ion preceding the la&s;t); that, to convince both of the im|propriety of their peaceable conduct,

oppo&s;ition, by making demands in the name of Ireland, pointed out what &s;he might extort from Great Britain; that the facility with which relief was (for|merly) granted, in&s;tead of &s;atisfying oppo&s;ition, was calculated to create new demands&mdash;the&s;e demands, as they in|terfered with the commerce of Great Britain, were certain of being oppo&s;ed; a circum&s;tance which could not fail to create that de&s;irable confu&s;ion which &s;uits the views of the party&mdash;that they (the Iri&s;h) had long felt their own mi&s;ery, without knowing well from whence it came&mdash;our worthy patriots, by point|ing out Great Britain as the cau&s;e of Iri&s;h di&s;tre&s;s, may have &s;ome chance of rou&s;ing Iri&s;h re&s;entment.&endq;</Q> This I quote from a pamphlet as perfectly con|temptible in point of writing, as it is fal&s;e in its facts, and wicked in its de&s;ign; but, as it is written under the authority

of mini&s;ters, by one of their principal literary pen&s;ioners, and was circulated with great diligence, and, as I am cre|dibly informed, at a con&s;iderable expence to the public, I u&s;e the words of that book, to let you &s;ee in what manner the friends and patrons of Ireland, the heroes of your parliament, repre&s;ented all efforts for your relief here; what means they took to di&s;po&s;e the minds of the people towards that great object; and what en|couragement they gave to all who &s;hould choo&s;e to exert them&s;elves in your fa|vour. Their unwearied endeavours were not wholly without &s;ucce&s;s, and the un|thinking people in many places became ill affected towards us on this account; for the mini&s;ters proceeded in your affairs ju&s;t as they did with regard to tho&s;e of America:&mdash;they always repre&s;ented you as a parcel of blockheads, without &s;en&s;e, or even feeling; that all your words

were only the echoes of faction here; and, as you have &s;een above, that you had not under&s;tanding enough to know that your trade was cramped by re&s;trictive acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, unle&s;s we had, for factious purpo&s;es, given you the information.</P>
<P>They were &s;o far from giving the lea&s;t intimation of the mea&s;ures which have &s;ince taken place, that tho&s;e, who were &s;uppo&s;ed the mo&s;t to know their inten|tions, declared them impo&s;&s;ible, in the actual &s;tate of the two kingdoms; and &s;poke of nothing but an act of union, as the only way that could be found of giving freedom of trade to Ireland, con|&s;i&s;tently with the intere&s;ts of this king|dom. Even when the &s;e&s;&s;ion opened, Lord North declared, that he did not know what remedy to apply to a di&s;ea&s;e, of the cau&s;e of which he was ignorant;
<PB N="42" REF="40">
and, not being then entirely re&s;olved how far they &s;hould &s;ubmit to your energy, they, by anticipation, &s;et the above au|thor, or &s;ome of his a&s;&s;ociates, to fill the news-papers with invectives again&s;t us as di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the mini&s;ter by extravagant demands in favour of Ireland.</P>
<P>I need not inform you that every thing they a&s;&s;erted of the &s;teps taken in Ireland, as the re&s;ult of our machinations, was ut|terly fal&s;e and groundle&s;s. For my&s;elf, I &s;incerely prote&s;t to you, that I neither wrote a word nor received a line upon any matter relative to the trade of Ireland, or to the politicks of it, from the beginning of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion to the day that I was honoured with your letter (of December 20th, 1779). It would be an affront to the talents in the Iri&s;h parliament to &s;ay one word more.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="41">
What was done in Ireland during that period, in and out of parliament, never will be forgotten:&mdash;you rai&s;ed an army, new in its kind, and adequate to its pur|po&s;es. It effected its ends without its exertion. It was not under the autho|rity of law mo&s;t certainly; but it de|rived from an authority &s;till higher: and, as they &s;ay of faith, it is not contrary to rea&s;on, but above it; &s;o this army did not &s;o much contradict the &s;pirit of the law, as &s;uper&s;ede it. What you did in the legi&s;lative body is above all prai&s;e. By your proceeding with regard to the &s;upplies, you revived the grand charac|teri&s;tick benefit of parliament, which was on the point of being entirely lo&s;t among&s;t us. The&s;e &s;entiments I never concealed, and never &s;hall; and Mr. Fox expre&s;&s;ed them with his u&s;ual power when he &s;poke on the occa&s;ion.</P>

All this is very honourable to you; but in what light mu&s;t we &s;ee it? How are we to con&s;ider your armament without commi&s;&s;ion from the crown, when &s;ome of the fir&s;t people in this kingdom have been refu&s;ed arms at the time they did not only not reject, but &s;o|licited, the King's commi&s;&s;ions. Here to arm and embody would be repre&s;ented as little le&s;s than high trea&s;on, if done on private authority: with you it receives the thanks of a privy coun&s;ellor of Great Britain, who obeys the Iri&s;h Hou&s;e of Lords in that point with plea&s;ure, and is made &s;ecretary of &s;tate the moment he lands here, for his reward. You &s;horten|ed the credit given to the crown for &s;ix months; you hung up the publick cre|dit of your kingdom by a thread; you refu&s;ed to rai&s;e any taxes, whil&s;t you confe&s;&s;ed the publick debt and publick exigencies to be great and urgent beyond

example:&mdash;you certainly acted in a great &s;tyle, and on &s;ound and invincible principles; but, if we, in the oppo&s;ition which fills Ireland with &s;uch loyal honors, had even attempted, what we never did even attempt, the &s;malle&s;t delay, or the &s;malle&s;t line taken off the &s;upply, in order to a con&s;titutional coertion of the crown, we &s;hould have been decried, by all the court and tory mouths of this kingdom, as a de&s;perate faction aiming at the direct ruin of the country, and to &s;urrender it bound hand and foot to a foreign enemy. For actually doing what we never ventur|ed to attempt, you have paid your court with &s;uch addre&s;s, and have won &s;o much favour with his Maje&s;ty and his cabinet, that they have, of their &s;pecial grace and mere motion, rai&s;ed you to new titles; and, for the fir&s;t time, in a &s;peech from the throne, complimented you with the appellation of "faithful and loyal;"

and, in order to in&s;ult our low-&s;pirited and degenerate obedience, have thrown the&s;e epithets and your re&s;i&s;tance toge|ther in our teeth. What do you think were the feelings of every man, who looks upon parliament in an higher light than that of a market overt for legali&s;ing a ba&s;e traffick of votes and pen&s;ions, when he &s;aw you employ &s;uch means of coertion to the crown, in order to coerce parliament through that medium? How much his Maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed with his part of the civility mu&s;t be left to his own ta&s;te; but, as to us, you declared to the world, that you knew that the &s;ole way of bringing us to rea&s;on, was to apply your&s;elves to the true &s;ource of all our opinions, and the only motive to all our conduct. Now, it &s;eems, you think your&s;elves affronted, becau&s;e a few of us expre&s;s &s;ome indignation at the mini&s;ter, who has thought fit to &s;trip us &s;tark

He might, and ought, by a longer continuance, or by an earlier meeting of parliament, to have given our conce&s;&s;ion the air of benignity, by making it a voluntary act; or he might have given us the credit of &s;ome wi&s;dom in fore&s;eeing and anticipating an approaching force:&mdash;&s;o far from it, Lord Gower, coming out of his own cabinet, declares that one principal cau&s;e of his re&s;ignation was his not being able to pre|vail on the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter to give any &s;ort of application to this bu&s;ine&s;s. Even on the late meeting, nothing determinate could be drawn from him, or from any of his a&s;&s;ociates, until you had actually pa&s;&s;ed the &s;hort money-bill, which mea|&s;ure they flattered them&s;elves, and a&s;&s;ured

<P>Judge, my dear Sir, of our &s;urprize at finding your cen&s;ure directed again&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e only crime con&s;i&s;ted in ac|cu&s;ing the mini&s;ters of not having pre|vented your demands by our graces; of not having given you the natural ad|vantages of your country, in the mo&s;t ample, the mo&s;t early, and the mo&s;t liberal manner; and for not having re|laxed authority in &s;uch a manner as to en&s;ure friend&s;hip. That you &s;hould make the panegyrick of the mini&s;ters, is what I expected; becau&s;e, in prai&s;ing their bounty, you paid a ju&s;t compliment to your own force: but, that you &s;hould rail at us, either individually or col|lectively, is what I can &s;carcely think a

natural proceeding.&mdash;I can ea&s;ily con|ceive, that gentlemen might grow frightened at what they had done; that they might imagine they had undertaken a bu&s;ine&s;s above their hand; that the in&s;truments of their power might be too va&s;t and unmanageable for their direc|tion; that, having obtained a &s;tate of independence for their country, they meant to take the de&s;erted helm into their own hands, and to &s;upply by their very real abilities the total in&s;ufficiency of the nominal government: all the&s;e might be real, and might be very ju&s;ti|fiable motives for their reconciling them|&s;elves cordially to the pre&s;ent court|&s;y&s;tem; but I do not &s;o well di&s;cern the rea&s;ons that could induce them, at the fir&s;t feeble dawning of life in this country, to do all in their power to ca&s;t a cloud over it, and to prevent the lea&s;t hope of our effecting the nece&s;&s;ary re|reformations

which are aimed at in our con&s;titution and in our national oeco|nomy.</P>
<P>But, it &s;eems, I was &s;ilent at the pa&s;&s;|ing the re&s;olution. Why, what had I to &s;ay? If I thought them too much, I &s;hould have been accu&s;ed of an endeavour to inflame England. If I &s;hould repre|&s;ent them as too little, I &s;hould have been charged with a de&s;ign of fomenting the di&s;contents of Ireland into actual re|bellion. The Trea&s;ury Bench repre&s;ented that the affair was a matter of &s;tate; they repre&s;ented it truly: I, therefore, only a&s;ked, whether they knew their propo|&s;itions to be &s;uch as would &s;atisfy Ireland; for, if they were &s;o, they would &s;atisfy me. This did not indicate that I thought them too ample. In this very &s;ilence, however di&s;honourable to parliament, there was one advantage, that the whole pa&s;&s;ed, as far as it is gone, with compleat

unanimity, and &s;o quietly, that there was no time left to execute any oppo&s;ition to it out of doors.</P>
<P>In the We&s;t-India bu&s;ine&s;s, rea&s;oning on what had lately pa&s;&s;ed in the parlia|ment of Ireland, and on the mode in which it was opened here, I thought I &s;aw much matter of perplexity; but I have now better rea&s;on than ever to be plea&s;ed with my &s;ilence.</P>
<P>If I had &s;poken, one of the hone&s;t and able&s;t men in the Iri&s;h parliament, would probably have thought my ob&s;er|vations an endeavour to &s;ow di&s;&s;ention, which he was re&s;olved to prevent; and one of the mo&s;t ingenious and one of the mo&s;t amiable men, that ever graced yours, or any Hou&s;e of parliament, might have looked upon it as <HI>a chimera.</HI> Indeed, in the &s;ilence I ob&s;erved, I was

&s;trongly countenanced (to &s;ay no more of it) by every gentleman of Ireland that I had the honour of conver&s;ing with in London. The only word, for that rea|&s;on, which I &s;poke, was to re&s;train a worthy country member, who had re|ceived &s;ome communication from a great trading place in the county he repre&s;ent|ed, which, if it had been opened to the hou&s;e, would have led to a perplexing di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of one of the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome matters that could ari&s;e in this bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P>That it &s;hould be a matter of public di&s;cretion in me to be &s;ilent on the affairs of Ireland, is what, on all accounts, I bitterly lament. I &s;tated to the hou&s;e what I felt; and I felt, as &s;trongly as hu|man &s;en&s;ibility can feel, the extinction

of my parliamentary capacity when I wi&s;hed to u&s;e it mo&s;t. When I came into this parliament, ju&s;t fourteen years ago, then, in vulgar opinion at lea&s;t, the pre&s;iding council of the greate&s;t empire exi&s;ting, (and perhaps, all things con|&s;idered, that ever did exi&s;t,) ob&s;cure and a &s;tranger as I was, I con&s;idered my&s;elf as rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t dignity to which a creature of our &s;pecies could a&s;pire. In that opinion, one of the chief plea&s;ures in my &s;ituation, what was fir&s;t and up|permo&s;t in my thoughts, was the hope (without injury to this country) to be &s;omewhat u&s;eful to the place of my birth and education, which, in many re&s;pects, internal and external, I thought ill and impolitically governed: but when I found, that the hou&s;e, &s;urrendering it&s;elf to the guidance, not of an authority grown out of experience, wi&s;dom, and integrity, but of the accidents of court favour, had be|become
<PB N="54" REF="52">
the &s;port of the pa&s;&s;ions of men, at once ra&s;h and pu&s;illanimous,&mdash;that it had even got into the habit of refu&s;ing every thing to rea&s;on, and &s;urrendering every thing to force,&mdash;all my power of obliging either my country or individuals was gone; all the lu&s;tre of my imaginary rank was tarni&s;hed, and I felt degraded even by my elevation. I &s;aid this, or &s;omething to this effect. If it gives um|brage to Ireland, I am &s;orry for it: it was the rea&s;on I gave for my &s;ilence, and it was, as far as it went, the true one.</P>
<P>With you, this &s;ilence of mine, and of others, was repre&s;ented as factious, and as a di&s;countenance to the mea&s;ure of your relief.&mdash;Do you, then, think as children?&mdash;If it had been our wi&s;h to embroil matters, and, for the &s;ake of di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing mini&s;try, to commit the two kingdoms in a di&s;pute, we had nothing

to do but (without at all condemning the propo&s;itions) to have gone into the commercial detail of the objects of them.

The only thing in which we differ with you, is this, that we do not think your attaching your&s;elves to the court, and quarrelling with the independent part of this people, is the way to promote the union of two free countries, or the holding them toge|ther by the mo&s;t natural and &s;alutary ties.</P>
