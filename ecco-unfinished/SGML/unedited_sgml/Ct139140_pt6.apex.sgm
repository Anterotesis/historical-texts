<P>OF all animated beings, the Fly-bird is the mo&s;t elegant in its form, and the mo&s;t brilliant in its colours. The precious &s;tones and metals poli&s;hed by our art cannot be com|pared to this jewel of nature. Her miniature
<PB N="2" REF="15">
productions are ever the mo&s;t wonderful; &s;he has placed it in the order of birds, at the bottom of the &s;cale of magnitude; but all the talents which are only &s;hared among the others, nim|blene&s;s, rapidity, &s;prightline&s;s, grace, and rich decoration, &s;he has be&s;towed profu&s;ely upon this little favourite. The emerald, the ruby, the topaz, &s;parkle in its plumage, which is never &s;oiled by the du&s;t of the ground. It inhabits the air; it flutters from flower to flower; it breathes their fre&s;hne&s;s; it feeds on their nec|tar, and re&s;ides in climates where they blow in perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is in the hotte&s;t part of the new world that all the &s;pecies of Fly-birds are found. They are numerous, and &s;eem confined between the two tropics <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laet. <HI>Ind. Occid.</HI> Lib. V. 256.</NOTE>; for tho&s;e which penetrate in &s;ummer within the temperate zones make but a &s;hort &s;tay. They follow the cour&s;e of the &s;un; with him they advance or retire; they fly on the wings of the zephir, to wanton in eternal &s;pring.</P>
<P>The Indians, &s;truck with the dazzle and glow of the colours of the&s;e brilliant birds, have named them the <HI>beams or locks of the &s;un</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave.</NOTE>. The Spaniards call them <HI>tomineos,</HI> on account of their diminutive &s;ize, <HI>tomine</HI> &s;ignifying a weight of twelve grains. "I &s;aw," &s;ays Nie|remberg, "one of the&s;e birds weighed with its

ne&s;t, and the whole together did not amount to two tomines <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nieremberg, p. 239. Aco&s;ta, Lib. IV. cap. 37.</NOTE>." The &s;maller &s;pecies do not exceed the bulk of the great gad-fly, or the thickne&s;s of the drone. Their bill is a fine needle, and their tongue a delicate thread; their little black eyes re&s;emble two brilliant points; the feathers of their wings are &s;o thin as to look tran&s;parent <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave.</NOTE>; hardly can the feet be perceiv|ed, &s;o &s;hort they are and &s;o &s;lender: and the&s;e are little u&s;ed, for they re&s;t only during the night. Their flight is buzzing, continued, and rapid; Marcgrave compares the noi&s;e of their wings to the <HI>whirr</HI> of a &s;pinning-wheel: &s;o rapid is the quiver of their pinions, that when the bird halts in the air, it &s;eems at once de|prived of motion and of life. Thus it re&s;ts a few &s;econds be&s;ide a flower, and again &s;hoots to another like a gleam. It vi&s;its them all, thru&s;ting its little tongue into their bo&s;om, and care&s;&s;ing them with its wings; it never &s;ettles, but it never quite abandons them. Its playful incon&s;tancy multiplies its innocent plea&s;ures; for the dalliance of this little lover of flowers never &s;poils their beauty. It only &s;ips their ho|ney, and its tongue &s;eems calculated for that purpo&s;e: it con&s;i&s;ts of two hollow fibres, form|ing a &s;mall canal <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Macrgrave.</NOTE>, parted at the end into two

But we cannot reject a number of re&s;pectable au|thorities for a &s;ingle ha&s;ty a&s;&s;ertion; though the Fly-bird &s;wallow &s;ome in&s;ects, does it thence follow that it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon them? Nay, mu&s;t it not nece&s;&s;arily happen, that, &s;ucking the ho|ney from the flowers, or gathering their pol|len, it will &s;ometimes &s;wallow the little in|&s;ects which are entangled?

<P>IT is congruous to begin with the &s;malle&s;t &s;pecies, in enumerating the &s;malle&s;t genus. This Lea&s;t Fly-bird is &s;carce fifteen lines in length; its bill is three and a half, its tail four: &s;o that there remains only nine lines for the head, the neck, and the body. It is &s;maller, therefore, than &s;ome of our flies. All the up|per &s;ide of the head and body is of a gold green changing brown, and with reddi&s;h reflections; all the under &s;ide is of a white grey. The fea|thers of the wing are brown, inclining to violet, and this is the general colour of the wings in all the Fly-birds, as well as in the colibris. The bill al&s;o and the feet are commonly black, the legs are clothed pretty low with little downy plumules; and the toes are furni&s;hed with little &s;harp curved nails. All of them have &s;ix feathers in the tail; Marcgrave mentions only four, which
<PB N="11" REF="24">
is probably a mi&s;take of the tran&s;criber. The colour of the&s;e tail-feathers is, in mo&s;t of the &s;pecies, blui&s;h black, with the lu&s;tre of bur|ni&s;hed &s;teel. In the female the colours are ge|nerally not &s;o bright; it is acknowledged too by the be&s;t ob&s;ervers to be rather &s;maller than the male <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grew in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, <HI>No.</HI> 200, <HI>art.</HI> 5.&mdash;Labat, Dutertre.</NOTE>.

In a &s;ide view, it has a gold tinge, and, &s;een from below, it appears a dull garnet. We may remark that the feathers of the throat are fa&s;hioned and di&s;po&s;ed like &s;cales, round and detached; which arrange|ment multiplies the reflections, that play both on the neck and the head of the Fly-birds, among all their &s;parkling feathers.

The form of the wings is &s;ingular: Cate&s;by compares it to the blade of a Turki&s;h &s;cimeter.

<P>THIS name marks a very &s;ingular character, which di&s;tingui&s;hes this bird from all the re&s;t. Not only its head is ornamented with a pretty long rufous tuft, but on each &s;ide of the neck, below the ears, ri&s;e &s;even or eight un|equal feathers; the two longe&s;t, being &s;ix or &s;even lines, are rufous, and narrow throughout,

but the ends a little windened, and tipt with a green dot. The bird erects them reclining them back; while at re&s;t they lie flat on the neck, as al&s;o does the beautiful tuft: but they are all bri&s;tled when it flies, and the bird ap|pears quite round. The throat and the fore fide of the neck are of a rich gold-green (if the eye be held much lower than the object, the&s;e brilliant feathers appear entirely brown); the head and all the upper &s;ide of the body green, with dazzling reflections of gold and bronze, as far as the white bar that cro&s;&s;es the rump; beyond this, to the end of the tail, is &s;pread a &s;hining gold on a brown ground on the outer webs of the quills, and rufous on the inner ones; the under &s;ide of the body is gold-green brown; the lower belly, white. The Tufted-neck does not exceed the &s;ize of the Amethy&s;t; the female re&s;embles it, except that it has no tuft or external ears: the bar of the rump is ru&s;ty, and &s;o is the throat; the re&s;t of the under &s;ide of the body rufous, &s;haded with greeni&s;h; its back and the upper &s;ide of the head are as in the male, green with gold and bronze reflections.</P>

<P>OF all the birds of the genus, this is the mo&s;t beautiful, &s;ays Marcgrave, and the mo&s;t elegant: it has colours and the &s;park|ling fire of the Ruby and the Topaz: the upper &s;ide of its head and neck is as brilli|ant as a ruby; the throat, all the fore &s;ide of the neck, in the front view, dazzle like the Aurora Topaz of Brazil. The &s;ame parts, &s;een a little lower, re&s;emble unburni&s;hed gold, and &s;till lower, change into a dull green; the top of the neck and the belly are of a velvet black brown; the wing is violet brown; the lower belly white; the inferior coverts of the tail and its quills are of a fine gold-rufous, and tinged with purple; it is edged with brown at the end; the rump is brown, heightened with gold-green; the wings, when clo&s;ed, do not extend beyond the tail, who&s;e quills are equal. Marcgrave remarks that it is broad, and that the bird di&s;plays it gracefully in flying. It is pretty large for its kind.

The two exterior quills are two inches longer than the two mid-ones; the lateral ones continually dimini&s;h, which makes the tail very much forked. The bird is dark blue, gli&s;tening like burni&s;hed &s;teel; all the body, both above and below, is of a &s;hining gold-green; there is a white &s;pot on the lower belly; the wings, when clo&s;ed, reach only to the middle of the tail, which is three inches and three lines; the bill is eleven lines, and the total length is &s;ix inches. The entire re&s;emblance between this de&s;crip|tion and that which Marcgrave gives of his third &s;pecies, convinces us that they are the &s;ame, contrary to the opinion of Bri&s;&s;on, who makes it his twentieth &s;pecies.

<P>WHEN nature be&s;towed beauty &s;o lavi&s;h|ly on the fly-birds, &s;he neglected not their kindred tribe, the Colibris.

Colibris &s;hould be ranged below the creepers, though they differ in the &s;hape and length of their bill; in the number of the feathers of their tail, there being ten in the former and twelve in the latter; and in the &s;tructure of their tongue, which is &s;imple in the latter, but in the former divided into two &s;emi-cylindrical portions, as in the fly-bird.</P>
<P>All naturali&s;ts agree that the Colibris and fly-birds have the &s;ame manner of living. It has, indeed, been denied that either of the&s;e tribes feed on the honey of flowers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal de Phy&s;ique, <HI>Janvier</HI> 1778.</NOTE>. But the rea|&s;ons already adduced convince us that this a&s;|&s;ertion is unfounded; and the general re&s;em|blance of the&s;e birds corroborates the evidence that their mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It is no le&s;s difficult to breed the young of the Colibri than tho&s;e of the fly-bird; they are as delicate, and confinement proves equally fa|tal to them. The parents have been &s;een, hur|ried on by the audacity of affection, to ru&s;h with food for their progeny into the very hands of the plunderer. Labat relates an in&s;tance of this, which de&s;erves to be quoted. "I &s;how|ed," &s;ays he, "to Father Montdidier a ne&s;t of Colibris, which was placed on a &s;hed near the hou&s;e. He carried it off with the young, when they were about fifteen or twenty days old, and put them in a cage at his room window, where
<PB N="42" REF="58">
the cock and hen continued to feed them, and grew &s;o tame, that they &s;carcely ever left the room; and though not &s;hut in the cage, nor &s;ubjected to any re&s;traint, they u&s;ed to eat and &s;leep with their brood. I have often &s;een all the four &s;itting upon Father Montdidier's finger, &s;inging, as if they had been perched upon a branch. He fed them with a very fine and almo&s;t limpid pa&s;te, made with bi&s;cuit, Spani&s;h wine, and &s;ugar. They dipt their tongue in it, and when their appetite was &s;a|tisfied they fluttered and chanted...

<P>THE animals which man has the mo&s;t ad|mired, are tho&s;e that &s;eem to partici|pate of his nature. He is &s;truck with wonder as often as he traces his external form in the ape, or hears his voice imitated by the Parrot; and, in fir&s;t moments of his &s;urpri&s;e, he is di&s;|po&s;ed to rank them above the re&s;t of the brutes. The&s;e animals have fixed even the &s;tupid at|tention of &s;avages, who behold the magnificent &s;cene of nature and her exqui&s;ite productions with the mo&s;t perfect in&s;en&s;ibility: they &s;top the progre&s;s of their canoes, and linger gazing whole hours at the capers of the marmo&s;et. Parrots are the only birds which they are fond of rai&s;ing and educating, and which they are even at pains to improve; for they have di&s;covered the art, which is &s;till unknown to us, of vary|ing

and heightening the colours that deck the plumage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e Parrots to which the &s;avages give artificial colours are termed <HI>tapir&eacute;s.</HI> This is effected, it is &s;aid, by means of the blood of a frog, which they drop into the &s;mall wounds made in young Parrots by plucking their feathers: tho&s;e which &s;prout again change their green or yellow tints into orange, ro&s;e colour, or variegated hues, according to the medicaments employed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The power of u&s;ing the hand, and of walk|ing on two feet, the re&s;emblance, how faint &s;oever, to the face, the want of a tail, the naked hams; the &s;imilarity of the &s;exual parts, the po&s;ition of the brea&s;ts, and the men&s;trual flux in the females; the ardent pa&s;&s;ion of the males for women: all the&s;e circum&s;tances have procured to the ape the name of <HI>wild man</HI> from tho&s;e who them&s;elves are indeed only half-men, and who can compare only the exterior charac|ters. Had what was equally po&s;&s;ible taken place, had the voice of the Parrot been be&s;tow|ed on the ape; the human race would have been &s;truck dumb with a&s;toni&s;hment, and the philo&s;opher could hardly have been able to de|mon&s;trate that the ape was &s;till a brute. It is fortunate, therefore, that nature has &s;eparated the faculties of imitating our &s;peech and our ge&s;tures, and &s;hared them between two very different &s;pecies; and while &s;he has conferred on all animals the &s;ame &s;en&s;es, and on &s;ome the &s;ame members and organs, with man, &s;he has re&s;erved for him alone the power of improving
<PB N="65" REF="81">
them; that noble mark of our pre-eminence, which con&s;titutes our empire over the animated world.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of improvement; the one barren, and confined to the individual; the other prolific, and extending through the &s;pe|cies, and cultivated in proportion as it is encou|raged by the in&s;titutions of the &s;ociety. Among brutes, the experience of one race is never tran&s;mitted to the &s;ucceeding; their acqui|&s;itions are merely individual; they are the &s;ame now that they ever were&mdash;ever will be. But man is progre&s;&s;ive; he receives the in&s;tructions of pa&s;t ages, he reaps the benefit of the di&s;co|veries of others, and, by a proper u&s;e of his time, he may continually advance in know|ledge. And who can, without regret and in|dignation, view that long gloomy night of ig|norance and barbari&s;m, which over&s;pread Eu|rope, and which not only arre&s;ted our improve|ment, but thru&s;t us back from that elevation which we had attained? But for the&s;e unfor|tunate vici&s;&s;itudes, the human &s;pecies would invariably approach towards the point of per|fection.</P>
<P>The mere &s;avage, who &s;huns all &s;ociety, and receives only an individual education, cannot improve his &s;pecies, and will not differ, even in under&s;tanding, from tho&s;e animals on which he has be&s;towed his name. Nor will he acquire even &s;peech, if the family be di&s;per&s;ed, and the
<PB N="66" REF="82">
children abandoned &s;oon after birth. The fir&s;t rudiments of the &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition are therefore unfolded by the tender attachment and the watchful &s;olicitude of the mother; the helple&s;s &s;tate of the infant requires con&s;tant and a&s;&s;idu|ous attention; its claimant cries are an&s;wered by &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ions, which begins the form|ation of language, and, during the &s;pace of two or three years, this grows in &s;ome degree fixed and regular. But, in other animals, the growth is much more rapid; the parental endearments la&s;t only &s;ix weeks or two months; and the impre&s;&s;ions are &s;light and tran&s;itory; and, after &s;eparation, they entirely cea&s;e. It is not, there|fore, to the peculiar &s;tructure of our organs that we are indebted for the attainment of &s;peech; the Parrots can articulate the &s;ame &s;ounds, but their language is mere prattle, and void of &s;ig|nification.</P>
<P>The power of imitating our di&s;cour&s;e or our actions, confers no real &s;uperiority on an ani|mal. It never incites to the cultivation of ta|lents; it never tends to the improvement of the &s;pecies. The articulation of the Parrot implies only the clo&s;e analogy of its organs of hearing and of voice to tho&s;e in man; and that &s;imilarity of &s;tructure obtains, though in a le&s;s degree, in many other birds, who&s;e tongue is thick, round, and nearly of the &s;ame form. The &s;tares, the blackbirds, the jays, the jack-daws, &amp;c. can imitate words. Tho&s;e who&s;e tongue is forked
<PB N="67" REF="83">
(and almo&s;t all the &s;mall birds may be ranged in that cla&s;s), whi&s;tle more ea&s;ily than they prattle; and if, with this &s;tructure, they have al&s;o &s;en&s;ibility of ear, and can accurately retain the impre&s;&s;ions made on that organ, they will learn to repeat airs: the canary, the linnet, the &s;i&s;kin, and the bulfinch, &s;eem natural mu&s;icians. The Parrot imitates every &s;ort of noi&s;e, the mewing of cats, the barking of dogs, and the notes of other birds, as well as the human voice; yet it can only &s;cream or pronounce very &s;hort phra&s;es; and, though capable of even articulating &s;ounds, it is unable to mo|dulate the&s;e, or &s;upport them by intermingling gentle cadences. It has therefore le&s;s acute|ne&s;s of perception, le&s;s memory, and le&s;s flexi|bility of organs.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o two different kinds of imita|tion; the one is acquired from reflection; the other is innate and mechanical: the latter pro|ceeds from the common in&s;tinct diffu&s;ed through a whole &s;pecies, which prompts or con&s;trains each individual to perform &s;imilar actions; and the more &s;tupid the animal, the more entire will be this influence, and the clo&s;er will be the re&s;emblance. A &s;heep has invariably the &s;ame habits with every other &s;heep; the fir&s;t cell of a bee is preci&s;ely like the la&s;t. The knowledge of the individual is equal to that of the &s;pecies;&mdash;&s;uch is the di&s;tinction between rea&s;on and in&s;tinct. The other kind of imita|tion,
<PB N="68" REF="84">
which &s;hould be regarded as artificial, is the acqui&s;ition of the individual, and cannot be communicated. The mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Parrot will never tran&s;mit his talent of prattling to his offspring. When an animal is in&s;tructed by man, the improvement re&s;ts with it alone. This imitation depends as well as the former on the peculiar &s;tructure; but it al&s;o implies &s;en|&s;ibility, attention, and memory; and tho&s;e &s;pe|cies which are &s;u&s;ceptible of education, rank high in the order of organized beings. If the animal be ea&s;ily trained, and each individual re|ceive a certain degree of in&s;truction, as in the ca&s;e of the dogs, the whole &s;pecies will acquire &s;uperiority under the direction of man; but when abandoned to nature, the dog will relap&s;e into the wolf or the fox, and would never of it&s;elf emerge from that &s;tate.</P>
<P>All animals may therefore be improved by a&s;&s;ociating with man; but they cannot be in|&s;tructed to improve each other; for they ne|ver can communicate the ideas and know|ledge which they have acquired. Even birds who&s;e &s;hape and proportions are &s;o different from tho&s;e of quadrupeds, are &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ame degrees of education. The <HI>agamis</HI> can be trained to perform nearly all the actions of the dogs; a canary, properly bred, &s;hews its attachment by care&s;&s;es that are equally ani|mated, and more innocent and more &s;incere than tho&s;e of the cat. There are many in|&s;tances

of the wonderful effects of education on the rapacious birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"In 1763," &s;ays M. Fontaine, "a buzzard was brought to me that had been taken in a &s;nare: it was at fir&s;t extremely &s;avage and even cruel. I undertook to tame it, and I &s;ucceeded by leav|ing it to fa&s;t, and con&s;training it to come and eat out of my hand. By pur&s;uing this plan, I brought it to be very familiar; and after having &s;hut it up about &s;ix weeks, I began to allow it a little li|berty, taking the precaution, however, to tie both pinions of its wings. In this condition it walked out into my garden, and re|turned when I called it to feed. After &s;ome time, when I judged that I could tru&s;t to its fidelity, I removed the ligatures, and fa&s;|tened a &s;mall bell, an inch and a half in diameter, above its talon, and al&s;o attached on the brea&s;t a bit of copper having my name engraved. I then gave it entire liberty, which it &s;oon abu&s;ed; for it took wing, and flew as far as the fore&s;t of Bele&s;me. I gave it up for lo&s;t; but four hours after I &s;aw it ru&s;h into my hall, which was open, pur&s;ued by five other buzzards, which had con|&s;trained it to &s;eek its a&s;ylum.... After this adventure it ever pre&s;erved its fidelity to me, coming every night to &s;leep on my window; it grew &s;o familiar with me, as to &s;eem to take &s;ingular plea&s;ure in my company. It attended con&s;tantly at dinner, &s;at on a corner of the table, and very often care&s;&s;ed me with its head and bill, emitting a weak &s;harp cry, which however it &s;ometimes &s;of|tened. It is true that I alone had this privilege. It one day fol|lowed me, when I was on hor&s;eback, more than two leagues, &s;ail|ing above my head.... It had an aver&s;ion both to dogs and cats, nor was it in the lea&s;t afraid of them; it had often tough battles with them, and always came off victorious. I had four very &s;trong cats, which I collected into my garden be&s;ide my buzzard; I threw to them a bit of raw fle&s;h, the nimble&s;t cat &s;eized it, the re&s;t pur&s;ued; but the bird darted upon her body, bit her ears with his bill, and &s;queezed her &s;ides with his talons, with &s;uch force that the cat was obliged to relinqui&s;h her prize. Often another cat &s;natched it the in&s;tant it dropt, but &s;he &s;uffered the &s;ame treat|ment, till the buzzard got entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the plunder. He was &s;o dexterous in his defence, that when he perceived him&s;elf a&s;|&s;ailed at once by the four cats, he took wing, and uttered a cry of exultation. At la&s;t, the cats, chagrined at their repeated di&s;ap|pointment, would no longer contend.</P>
<P>"This buzzard had a &s;ingular antipathy; he would not &s;uffer a red cap on the head of any pea&s;ant, and &s;o alert he was in whip|ping it off, that they found their head bare without knowing what was become of their cap. He al&s;o &s;natched wigs without doing any injury, and he carried the&s;e caps and wigs to the talle&s;t tree in a neighbouring park, which was the ordinary depo&s;it of his booty.... He would &s;uffer no other bird of prey to enter his do|main; he attacked them very boldly, and put them to flight. He did no mi&s;chief in my court-yard, and the poultry, which at fir&s;t dreaded him, grew in&s;en&s;ibly reconciled to him. The chickens and ducklings received not the lea&s;t har&s;h u&s;age, and yet he bathed among the latter. But what is &s;ingular, he was not gentle to my neighbours' poultry; and I was often obliged to publi&s;h that I would pay for the damages which he might occa&s;ion. However, he was often fired at, and he received fifteen mu&s;ket-&s;hots, with|out &s;uffering any fracture. But once early in the morning, hover|ing over the &s;kirts of a fore&s;t, he dared to attack a fox; and the keeper &s;eeing him on the &s;houlders of the fox, fired two &s;hots at him; the fox was killed and the buzzard had his wing broken; yet notwith&s;tanding this fracture he e&s;caped from the keeper, and was lo&s;t &s;even days. This man having di&s;covered, from the noi&s;e of the bell, that he was my bird, came next morning to inform me; I &s;ent to make a &s;earch near the &s;pot; but the bird could not be found, nor did it return till &s;even days after. I had been u&s;ed to call him every evening with a whi&s;tle, which he an&s;wered not for &s;ix days; but, on the &s;eventh, I heard a feeble cry at a di&s;tance, which I judged to be that of my buzzard: I repeated the whi&s;tle a &s;econd time, and I heard the &s;ame cry. I went to the part whence the &s;ound came, and, at la&s;t, found my poor buzzard with his wing broken, which had travelled more than half a league on foot to regain his a&s;ylum, from which he was then di&s;tant about 120 paces. Though he was extremely reduced, he gave me many care&s;&s;es. It took near &s;ix weeks till he was recruited, and his wounds healed; after which he began to fly as before, and follow his old habits for about a year: he then di&s;appeared for ever. I am convinced that he was killed by accident; and that he would not have for&s;aken me from choice."</P>

<P>But that education which &s;eems to unfold the faculties, and meliorate the di&s;po&s;itions of qua|drupeds or birds, renders them odious to the re&s;t of their &s;pecies.

in the air. No ob&s;tacle can oppo&s;e their pro|gre&s;s; no &s;pot can fix their re&s;idence: the &s;ky is their country, and their cour&s;e is on the wings of the breeze. They fore&s;ee the vici&s;&s;i|tude of the &s;ea&s;ons, and watch their return. They generally appear when the mild influence of &s;pring has clothed the fore&s;ts with verdure; there they ne&s;tle, concealed under the foliage. Heaven and earth &s;eem to con&s;pire to their fe|licity. But &s;olicitude &s;oon ari&s;es: they dread the cruel vi&s;its of the &s;ame animals on which they before looked down with contempt. The wild cat, the marten, the weazel, &s;eek to de|vour the objects of their tendere&s;t affection: the adder clambers to gain their eggs, or devour their progeny: and children, that amiable por|tion of human kind, but who, from want of em|ployment, are ever in mi&s;chief, wantonly plun|der the &s;acred depo&s;its of love. Often the mo|ther ru&s;hes into danger in defence of her young; and &s;acrifices to the ardor of her attachment, her love, her liberty, and her life.</P>
<P>Why is the &s;ea&s;on of the highe&s;t plea&s;ures al&s;o the &s;ea&s;on of the greate&s;t &s;olicitude? Why are the mo&s;t delicious enjoyments always damp|ed, even in the free&s;t and mo&s;t innocent of be|ings, by the cruelle&s;t anxieties?

labours, have fabricated the man&s;ion of love, than they dread the plunderer's attack. The feathered race has al&s;o its tyrants; and the ra|pacious birds are the more formidable, as they are more independent. The eagle &s;natches with impunity the prey from the lion; all dread his a&s;pect; the feebler birds &s;cream at his approach, and &s;eek immediate &s;helter. Per|haps the eagle would have occupied a large por|tion of the earth, if man had not driven him to the &s;ummits of mountains and inacce&s;&s;ible tracks, where in &s;olitude he &s;tretches out his gloomy dominion.</P>
<P>From this cur&s;ory view, it would appear that birds rank next to man in the great &s;cale of ex|i&s;tence. Nature has accumulated and concen|trated more &s;trength in their little bodies than &s;he has communicated to the huge limbs of the mo&s;t powerful quadrupeds; agility is combined with &s;olidity; their empire extends over the in|habitants of the air, the earth, and the waters. The whole of the in&s;ect tribes are exclu&s;ively &s;ubject to their dominion, and &s;eem only de&s;|tined to feed the&s;e de&s;troyers: they al&s;o &s;eize the noxious reptiles on the ground, and &s;natch the fi&s;h from their element. They even at|tack the quadrupeds; the buzzard &s;ometimes darts on the fox, and the falcon &s;tops the ante|lope; the eagle preys on the &s;heep, murders the dog equally with the hare, and tran&s;ports their carca&s;es to his eyry. The birds walk on two
<PB N="74" REF="90">
feet, imitate &s;peech, and repeat mu&s;ical airs; in the&s;e re&s;pects too they re&s;emble man, while their power of flying marks a decided &s;uperi|ority above all the other terre&s;trial animals.</P>
<P>But from this general view of the nature of birds, let us de&s;cend to &s;urvey the genus of the Parrots. That tribe, the mo&s;t numerous of all, affords &s;triking illu&s;trations of a new propo&s;i|tion: that, in birds, as in quadrupeds, tho&s;e which inhabit the tropical regions are confined exclu&s;ively to their re&s;pective continents. This principle &s;erves to fix their nomenclature; the &s;pecies are much diver&s;ified and multiplied; above 100 are known, and yet of the&s;e not one is common to both continents. What can be a more deci&s;ive proof of this general propo&s;ition which we explained in the Hi&s;tory of Quadru|peds? The two continents were never joined, except towards the north, and therefore no ani|mal incapable of &s;upporting the inten&s;e cold of the frozen regions could migrate from the one into the other. Birds al&s;o, &s;uch as the Parrots, which live and propagate only in warm cli|mates, have remained indigenous; &s;ome inha|bit the tropical regions of the new continent, others tho&s;e of the old, and occupy in each a zone extending twenty-five degrees on both &s;ides of the equator.</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid that if the elephants and other large quadrupeds, which at pre&s;ent are peculiar to Africa and India, inhabited origi|nally
<PB N="75" REF="91">
the northern tracts in both continents, might not this have al&s;o been the ca&s;e in regard to the Parrots? And as the earth gradually cooled, the&s;e might continually advance to|wards the tropics; and neither the lofty moun|tains, nor the narrow pa&s;s of the i&s;thmus of Panama, could prevent their migration.</P>
<P>This objection, though plau&s;ible, is only a new que&s;tion, which, in whatever way it be re&s;olved, cannot affect our hypothe&s;is, that the north was the primaeval re&s;idence of animals, and that they afterwards removed to the regions of the &s;outh. But tho&s;e birds who&s;e con&s;titu|tion is adapted to a hot climate could never ri&s;e to the frozen &s;ummits of mountains; and the cold that prevails in the elevated regions of the air would as effectually &s;top their flight, as the various ob&s;tacles to be &s;urmounted would limit the progre&s;s of the elephant. Thus what appears at fir&s;t an objection, is really a con|firmation of the theory; &s;ince not only the quadrupeds, but al&s;o the birds, which are na|tives of the torrid tracts in the old world, have never penetrated or &s;ettled in the in&s;ulated con|tinent of South America. In the ca&s;e of the birds, however, this principle has &s;ome excep|tions; for a few &s;pecies are found equally in the equatorial parts of both continents. But this is owing to particular circum&s;tances; their vi|gorous wings and their power of re&s;ting on the &s;urface of the water by means of the broad mem|branes
<PB N="76" REF="92">
of their feet. The Parrots can neither &s;oar to a va&s;t height, nor fly to a great di&s;tance, and their feet are not webbed. Accordingly, none of the&s;e have ever migrated from the one continent to the other, unle&s;s tran&s;ported by men acro&s;s the intervening ocean <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Parrots have a laborious &s;hort flight, &s;o that they cannot cro&s;s an arm of the &s;ea &s;even or eight leagues broad.

"This Parrot ought to be reckoned among the large&s;t; it is equal in &s;ize to the capon; all its plumage is cinereous white; its bill is black and much in|curvated; the lower part of the back, the rump, all the tail, and the quills of the wings, are vermilion."

<P>The education of the Parrot has been com|pared to that of the child <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aelian.</NOTE>.

His fondne&s;s had all the marks of clo&s;e and warm friend&s;hip. The girl happened to have a very fore finger, which was tedious in healing, and &s;o painful as to make her &s;cream. While &s;he uttered her moans, the Parrot never left her chamber. The fir&s;t thing he did every day was to pay her a vi&s;it; and this tender condolence la&s;ted the whole time of the cure, and he again returned to his former calm &s;ettled attachment. Yet this &s;trong pre|dilection for the girl &s;eems to have been more directed to her office in the kitchen, than her per&s;on; for when another cook-maid &s;ucceeded to her, the Parrot &s;hewed the &s;ame degree of fondne&s;s the very fir&s;t day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by Madame Nadault, my &s;i&s;ter, to whom this Parrot belonged.</NOTE>."</P>

tumbling back clum&s;ily. He was then the mo&s;t cheerful; but he had al&s;o an extravagant joy, and an ince&s;&s;ant prattling when in the &s;tate of intoxication: for all Parrots love wine, particularly the Spani&s;h and the mu&s;cadine. Even in the time of Pliny it was remarked that the &s;umes of that liquor gave the Parrots a flow of &s;pirits <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In vino praecipue la&s;civa.</HI> Lib. X. 42.</NOTE>. He crept near the fire in winter, and his greate&s;t plea&s;ure, in that &s;ea&s;on, was to get on the chimney; and when warmed he gave many &s;igns of his comfortable feelings. He had equal plea&s;ure in the &s;ummer &s;howers; he continued whole hours expo&s;ed, and &s;pread his wings the better to receive the rain, and did not &s;eek for cover till he was wet to the &s;kin. After he had returned to his roo&s;t, he &s;tripped all the feathers one after another through his bill. If the weather was dry, he liked to bathe in a ci&s;tern of water, and entered into it repeatedly, though always very careful not to wet his head. But he was as aver&s;e to plunge in winter; and if then &s;hewn a ve&s;&s;el full of water, he would run off, and even &s;cream.</P>
<P>Sometimes he was ob&s;erved to yawn, and this was almo&s;t always the &s;ymptom of weari|ne&s;s. He whi&s;tled with more force and clear|ne&s;s than a man; but, though he expre&s;&s;ed many tones, he could never be taught to copy an air. He imitated perfectly the cries of wild

and dome&s;tic animals, particularly the crow, which he mimicked &s;o well, that he might have been taken for one.

In the evening he retired of his own accord to his cage, which he &s;hunned during the day: there with one foot concealed in the plumage, or hooked to the bars of the cage, and his head beneath his wings, he &s;lept until he perceived the dawn of the morn|ing; but he often wakened to the blaze of can|dles. Then he &s;tepped down to the bottom of the cage, and &s;harpened his claws, u&s;ing the &s;ame motion with the &s;cratching of a hen.

<P>The power of imitating exactly articulate di&s;|cour&s;e implies in the Parrot a peculiar and more perfect &s;tructure of organ; and the accuracy of its memory, though independent of the under|&s;tanding, manife&s;ts a clo&s;ene&s;s of attention and a &s;trength of mechanical recollection that no bird po&s;&s;es in &s;o high a degree. Accordingly, all the naturali&s;ts have remarked the &s;ingular form of its bill, its tongue, and its head: its bill, round on the out&s;ide and hollow within, has, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the capacity of a mouth, and allows the tongue to play freely; and the &s;ound, &s;triking again&s;t the circular border of the lower mandible, is there modified as on a row of teeth, while the concavity of the upper mandible re|flects it like the palate; and hence it does not utter a whi&s;tling, but a full, articulation. The tongue, which modulates all the &s;ounds, is pro|portionally larger than in man, and would be more voluble, were it not harder than fle&s;h, and inve&s;ted with a &s;trong horny membrane.</P>
<P>But this organization, though adju&s;ted with &s;kill, is &s;till inferior to the &s;tructure contrived to give an ea&s;y and powerful motion to the up|per mandible, and, at the &s;ame time, not to hinder its opening. The mu&s;cles are not fixed
<PB N="98" REF="115">
to the root, where they would have exerted no force; nor to the &s;ides, where they would have clo&s;ed the aperture. Nature has adopted a dif|ferent plan; at the bottom of the bill are fixed two bones, which, extending on both &s;ides, and under the cheeks, form a continuation of it, &s;imilar in form to the <HI>pterygoid</HI> bones in man, except that their hinder extremity is not con|creted into another bone, but loo&s;e. Thick layers of mu&s;cles, &s;ent off from the back of the head, and in&s;erted in the&s;e bones, move them and the bill. For a fuller de&s;cription of this &s;ingular contrivance, I &s;hall refer to Aldrovan|dus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tom. I. pp.</HI> 640 <HI>and</HI> 641.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This naturali&s;t properly ob&s;erves, that, be|tween the eye and the lower jaw, there is a &s;pace, which de&s;erves better the name of cheek than in any other bird; it is al&s;o more protu|berant, occa&s;ioned by the number of mu&s;cles that extend over it to the bill.</P>
<P>The bill is very &s;trong; the Parrot ea&s;ily cracks the nuts of the red fruits; it gnaws the wood, and even bends or wrenches the bars of its cage, if they be &s;lender, or if it be tired of confinement. It u&s;es its bill, oftener than its claws, in climbing and &s;u&s;pending it&s;elf; it al&s;o holds by the bill in de&s;cending, as if it were a third foot, which &s;teadies its motion; it al&s;o &s;erves to break its fall <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pliny, <HI>Lib.

<PB N="99" REF="116">
of touch, and is equally u&s;eful with its toes, in &s;crambling and clenching.</P>
<P>The mobility of its upper mandible gives it a power which no other birds have, of chewing its food. In tho&s;e, whether of the granivorous or carnivorous tribes, the bill is like a hand which throws the food into the gizzard, or an arm which &s;plits or tears it. The Parrot &s;eizes the piece &s;ideways, and gnaws deliberately <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We mu&s;t remark that the external hind toe is moveable, and that the bird draws it &s;idewi&s;e and forward, to &s;eize and handle what is given to it; but only in this &s;ingle ca&s;e does it u&s;e that power, and at other times, whether it walks or perches, it con|&s;tantly carries two toes before and two behind. Apuleius and So|linus &s;peak of Parrots with five toes; but this was owing to their mi&s;taking a pa&s;&s;age of Pliny, where that naturali&s;t a&s;cribes that uncommon property to a family of magpies <HI>(Lib. X.</HI> 42.)</NOTE>.

It is uncommon for Parrots to propagate in our temperate climates; but they frequently lay addle eggs. There are &s;ome in&s;tances, however, of Parrots being reared in France.

<P>THE bird, which Bri&s;&s;on has termed the <HI>Mo|lucca Maccaw,</HI> is undoubtedly only a Par|rakeet; for no Maccaw inhabits either India, or any part of the ancient continent.

<P>THIS &s;pecies comes likewi&s;e from the i&s;le of Lu&ccedil;on, and Sonnerat thus de&s;cribes it. "It is rather &s;maller than the preceding; the upper &s;ide of the neck, the back, the &s;mall fea|thers of the wings and of the tail, are of a deep green; the belly is light green and yellowi&s;h; the crown of the head is a very bright red in the male, and the feathers, which border the

upper margin of the bill in the female are of the &s;ame bright red, and there is al&s;o a yellow &s;pot above on the middle of the neck; in the male the throat is blue, in the female it is red; in both, the great feathers of the wings are black, tho&s;e that cover the upper &s;urface of the tail are red; the bill, feet, and iris, are yel|low. I conceive, &s;ays Sonnerat, the&s;e two Par|rakeets to be the male and female, becau&s;e they differ little, and are analogous in their &s;ize, &s;hape, and colour, and inhabit the &s;ame cli|mate; but I will not a&s;&s;ert that they may not be di&s;tinct &s;pecies.

<PB N="155" REF="176">
from Commer&s;on. We range it after the &s;hort-tailed Parrakeets, though it has a peculiar cha|racter that belongs not to any of the genus; viz. its tongue is pointed, and terminates in a pen|cil of &s;hort white bri&s;tles.</P>
<P>The plumage is entirely of a fine blue, ex|cept the throat and the lower part of the neck, which are white; the bill and feet are red. It is very common in Otaheite, where it flutters about continually &s;qualling. It forms flocks, and feeds on bananas, but it is difficult to do|me&s;ticate; it dies of melancholy, e&s;pecially if kept alone in the cage. It cannot be brought to eat any thing but the juice of fruits, and con&s;tantly rejects every kind of &s;olid diet. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>P&s;ittacus Taitianus:</HI> "It is blue; the feathers on its head longi&s;h; its throat white; its bill and feet red."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The ARAS.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the Parrots, the Ara is the large&s;t, and the mo&s;t magnificently decked; purple, gold, and azure, blaze on its plumage; its a&s;pect is &s;teady and compo&s;ed; its deportment grave, and even &s;upercilious, and as if con&s;cious of its beauty. But its calm temper &s;oon renders it familiar, and even &s;u&s;ceptible of a degree of at|tachment. It may be dome&s;ticated without be|ing en&s;laved; it never abu&s;es the liberty which has been granted to it; it contracts a fondne&s;s for the family where it is adopted, and con|&s;tantly returns from its rambling.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Aras are natives of the tropical parts of the new world, and inhabit both the conti|nent and the i&s;lands; but none are found in Africa, or in India.

<P>When the&s;e Parrots were introduced into Europe, they were beheld with admiration. Aldrovandus, who, for the fir&s;t time, &s;aw an Ara at Mantua in 1572, remarks that they were then quite novelties, and highly e&s;teemed; and that princes received the&s;e birds from one another as rare and valuable pre&s;ents. Even Belon, that curious ob&s;erver, had never &s;een a maccaw, for he &s;ays that the gray Parrots are the large&s;t of all.</P>

<P>ALL the nomenclators have followed Ge&s;ner and Aldrovandus in ranging the Red Aras in two &s;pecies. But, on the other hand, Marc|grave, and all the travellers, who have had an opportunity of viewing and comparing the birds, con&s;ider them as belonging to the &s;ame family.

It is &s;trange, therefore, that &s;ome authors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Albin and Willughby.</NOTE> have copied Al|bin in calling them <HI>Macao Parrots,</HI> and have imagined that they came from Japan. Some may have been carried thither from America, but they are undoubtedly not natives of Japan, and it is probable that the&s;e authors have confounded the great Red Lory of the Ea&s;t Indies with the Red Ara of the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>The great Red Ara is near thirty inches in length, but of this the tail occupies almo&s;t the one half; all the body, except the wings, is vermilion, the four longe&s;t feathers of the tail are the &s;ame; the great quills of the wing are Turkey-blue above, and copper-coloured on a black ground beneath; in the middle quills the blue and green are admirably melted into each other; the great coverts are gold-yellow, and terminated with green; the &s;houlders are of the &s;ame red with the back; the &s;uperior and infe|rior coverts of the tail are blue; four of the la|teral quills, on each &s;ide, are blue above, and the whole under &s;urface copper-colour, which is lighter and has more of the metallic glo&s;s un|der the four great middle quills: a tuft of &s;nuff-coloured velvet feathers projects, like a cu&s;hion, on the forehead; the throat is brown-red; a white and naked membranous &s;kin encircles the eye,

<P>Aras live in the woods that cover the &s;wampy grounds, where the palm trees abound, and they feed chiefly on the dates of the palmettoes, of which there are immen&s;e fore&s;ts in the over|flowed &s;avannahs. They generally appear in pairs, &s;eldom in flocks; &s;ometimes, however, they a&s;&s;emble together, and their united &s;creams are heard at a great di&s;tance. When any thing &s;cares or &s;urpri&s;es them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The Indians were in profound &s;ecurity (at Yubarco, in Da|rien), when the cries of a &s;ort of red Parrots of extraordinary &s;ize, which they call <HI>guacamayas,</HI> gave them notice of the approach of their enemies." <HI>Expedition of Ojeda,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Hi&s;t.

Of all the Parrots, they fly the be&s;t; they traver&s;e the cleared lands, but never alight; they perch on the &s;ummit of trees, or on the highe&s;t branch. During the day, they roam to a di&s;tance not exceeding a league in &s;earch of ripe fruits, but always return in the evening to the &s;ame &s;pot.

con&s;equences; whether it be that the manchi|neel does not grow in tho&s;e countries, or that the Aras, finding abundance of their proper food, &s;hun the food of that poi&s;onous tree.</P>
<P>It appears that the Parrots of the new world had nearly the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions with all tho&s;e animals which inhabit de&s;ert tracts; they were familiar, un&s;u&s;pecting, and fearle&s;s of the ap|proach of men, who in tho&s;e regions were feebly armed and few in number, and never could di&s;|play their dominion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The &s;mall birds which inhabited the woods of New Zea|land were &s;o little acquainted with men, that they calmly roo&s;ted on the branches of trees next us, even on the end of our mu&s;kets.

Hence Aldrovandus, who drew his information from the early ac|counts of America, &s;ays that the&s;e birds are na|turally attached to man, or, at lea&s;t, &s;hew no
<PB N="163" REF="184">
&s;ymptoms of fear in his pre&s;ence; that they follow the Indians into their huts, and &s;eem to contract an affection to the &s;pots inhabited by the&s;e peaceful men. A part of this confidence and &s;ecurity adheres to the Parrots which have retired to the fore&s;ts. M. de la Borde informs us that this is the ca&s;e with tho&s;e &s;ettled in Gui|ana; they allow one to approach very near them without betraying &s;u&s;picion or fear. And Pi&s;o &s;ays of the Brazilian birds, what may be applied to all tho&s;e of the new world, that they are in|cautious, and ea&s;ily decoyed into every kind of &s;nare.</P>
<P>The Aras make their ne&s;ts in the holes of old rotten trees, which are very common in their native regions, and more numerous even than the ri&s;ing vigorous plants: they enlarge the aperture, when it is too narrow, and line the in&s;ide with feathers. They have two hatches annually, like all the other American Parrots, and each con&s;i&s;ts of two eggs, which, accord|ing to Dutertre, are as large as pigeons' eggs, and &s;potted like tho&s;e of partridges <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It often happens that an Ara will lay an egg or two in our temperate climates; Aldrovandus cites &s;ome in&s;tances. M. le Mar|quis d'Abzac has informed us that a large Red Ara of his laid three eggs; they had no germ: however, as the bird was ardent and clamorous to cover, a hen's egg was given to her, which &s;he hatched." <HI>Letter of M. le Marquis d'Abzac, dated from the Ca&s;tle of Noyac, near Perigueux,</HI> 21 <HI>September,</HI> 1776.</NOTE>. He adds that the young ones have two &s;mall worms in their no&s;trils, and a third on a &s;mall ball which
<PB N="164" REF="185">
gathers above the head; and that the&s;e little worms die when the birds begin to be fledged <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Antilles, <HI>t. II. p.</HI> 249.</NOTE>. Such worms in the no&s;trils are not peculiar to the Aras; the other Parrots, the ca&s;&s;iques, and many other birds, are &s;ubject to them when in the ne&s;t: many quadrupeds al&s;o, the monkeys in particular, have worms in the no&s;e, and in other parts of the body. The&s;e in&s;ects are well known in America, and in the French &s;ettle|ments are called <HI>macaques worms.</HI> They creep into the fle&s;h, and occa&s;ion dangerous ab&s;ce&s;&s;es both in men and the other animals; hor&s;es &s;ometimes die of &s;uch di&s;orders, owing to their negligent treatment in tho&s;e countries, where they are never &s;tabled nor dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The male and female Aras &s;it alternately on their eggs, or cheri&s;h their young, and both equally carry food; they never de&s;ert the charge as long as their a&s;&s;i&s;tance is needed, and always perch together near the ne&s;t.</P>
<P>The young Aras are ea&s;ily tamed, and, in ma|ny parts of America, the&s;e birds are never taken but in the ne&s;ts, becau&s;e the adults are too dif|ficult to educate. Yet Dutertre relates, that the Carribs had a &s;ingular way of catching them alive; they ob&s;erved when the Aras were on the ground, eating fallen fruit; they endea|voured to &s;urround them, and on a &s;udden hal|looed, clapt their hands, and made &s;o great a
<PB N="165" REF="186">
noi&s;e, that the birds, in the moment of &s;urpri&s;e, lo&s;t the u&s;e of their wings, and turned on their back to defend them&s;elves with their bill and nails; the &s;avages then held out a &s;tick, on which they clenched, and were immediately tied by a &s;mall &s;tring. He al&s;o pretends that they could be tamed, though old, and caught in this violent way. But this account appears rather &s;u&s;picious; particularly, as all the Aras in fact fly from man, a loud noi&s;e mu&s;t have a greater effect in driving them away. Wafer &s;ays that the Indians who inhabit the i&s;thmus tame the Aras as we do magpies, and allow them to make excur&s;ions into the woods during the day, but that they con&s;tantly return home in the evening; that they imitate their ma&s;ter's voice, and the &s;ong of a bird called <HI>chicali</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wafer, in Dampier's Voyage.</NOTE>. Fernandez relates that they can be taught to &s;peak, but that their articulation is coar&s;e and di&s;|agreeable; that when they are kept in the hou&s;e, they rear their young like other dome&s;tic birds. It is certain, that they never prattle &s;o well as the other Parrots; and after they are tamed, they never try to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The Indians work the plumage into fe&s;tival caps, and other ornaments; they al&s;o &s;tick &s;ome of the rich feathers into the cheek, and through the no&s;trils, or the ears. The fle&s;h of the Aras, though commonly hard and black, is not un|plea&s;ant
<PB N="166" REF="187">
food, and makes excellent &s;oup; and, in general, the Parrots are u&s;ually eaten as the mo&s;t plentiful game in the &s;ettlement at Cay|enne.</P>
<P>The Ara is, more than any bird perhaps, &s;ub|ject to the cramp, which is more violent, and more quickly mortal, in the hot countries, than in the temperate climates. I kept one of the large&s;t and hand&s;ome&s;t of the kind, which was given to me by the Marchione&s;s of Pompadour in 1751. It was &s;eized with an epilep&s;y two or three times every month, and yet it lived &s;e|veral years at my &s;eat in Burgundy, and might have lived much longer, if it had not been kill|ed. But in South America, the&s;e birds com|monly die of the falling &s;ickne&s;s, and this is al&s;o the fate of all the other Parrots, which are equally &s;ubject to that di&s;order, in the dome&s;tic &s;tate. Perhaps the cau&s;e which we a&s;&s;igned in treating of the canary finches, obtains here, viz. the &s;eparation from the female, and the &s;uper|abundance of nutrition. The Indians, who rear the Aras in their huts with the view to &s;ell their feathers, have a remedy for the epilep&s;y; they cut the point of the toe, and the di&s;charge of a &s;ingle drop of blood works an immediate cure. The &s;ame operation &s;ucceeds equally in procur|ing relief to the other di&s;orders incident to the dome&s;tic &s;tate. I have formerly remarked that the canaries die when the blood does not form a drop at the bill. Nature &s;eems to point out
<PB N="167" REF="188">
the &s;ame remedy which the Indians have di&s;co|vered.</P>
<P>This epilep&s;y, or cramp, as it is called in the colonies, invariably happens to dome&s;ticated Parrots when they perch on a bit of iron, &s;uch as a nail, a curtain rod, &amp;c.; &s;o that great care is taken that they alight only on wood. This fact &s;eems to &s;hew that the fit, which is a vio|lent convul&s;ion of the nerves, is analogous to electricity, who&s;e action, it is well known, is more violent when tran&s;mitted through iron than through wood <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This analogy &s;eems to be rather fanciful. The effect mu&s;t be referred to the irritability of the mu&s;cular fibres, excited by the &s;harpne&s;s or a&s;perity of the touching &s;ub&s;tance, and by the &s;udden cold &s;hot through the bird's toes by the contact of metals, which is a rapid conductor of heat.

Sloane, and Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THE Green Ara is much rarer than the two preceding; it is al&s;o much &s;maller. It con&s;i&s;ts of only one &s;pecies, though nomencla|tors
<PB N="170" REF="192">
have divided it into two; becau&s;e they con|found it with the Green Parrakeet, which they call the <HI>Ara Parrakeet,</HI> on account of the length of its tail, and its di&s;tinctly articulating the word ara: but notwith&s;tanding the&s;e properties it is &s;till a Parrakeet, and very common in Cayenne; whereas the Green Ara is there altogether un|known. Sloane &s;ays that the Little Maccaw, or Little Green Ara, is very frequent in the woods of Jamaica. But Edwards properly ob|&s;erves that this is certainly a mi&s;take, becau&s;e, though he made &s;everal applications, he could procure none from his corre&s;pondents in that i&s;land. Perhaps Sloane confounded the long-tailed Green Parrakeet with the Green Ara.</P>
<P>We had a Green Ara alive: it was pre&s;ented by M. Sonini of Manoncour, who procured it at Cayenne from the &s;avages of Oyapoc, where it was caught in the ne&s;t. Its length, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail, is about &s;ixteen inches; its body, both above and below, is green, which according to the po&s;ition is golden and &s;parkling or deep olive; the great and &s;mall quills of the wing are beryl blue, on a brown ground, and the under &s;ide copper coloured; the under &s;ide of the tail is the &s;ame, and the upper &s;ide painted with beryl blue, melting into olive green; the green on the head is brighter and le&s;s mixed with olive than that on the re&s;t of the body; at the ba&s;e of the upper mandible, on the face, there is a black border of &s;mall
<PB N="171" REF="193">
linear feathers that re&s;emble bri&s;tles; the white naked &s;kin that &s;urrounds the eyes is &s;prinkled with &s;mall pencils of the &s;ame black bri&s;tles ranged in rows; the iris of the eye is yellow|i&s;h.</P>
<P>This bird is as beautiful as it is rare; and it is &s;till more amiable for its &s;ocial temper and gentle di&s;po&s;ition. It &s;oon grows familiar with per&s;ons whom it &s;ees frequently, and is plea&s;ed to receive and repay their care&s;&s;es. But it has an aver&s;ion to &s;trangers, and particularly to chil|dren, and flies at them furiou&s;ly. Like all other dome&s;ticated Parrots, it clings to the finger when pre&s;ented to it; it al&s;o cla&s;ps wood: but in winter, and even in &s;ummer, when the weather is cool and rainy, it prefers the arm or the &s;houlder, e&s;pecially if the per&s;on has wool|len clothes, for in general it likes warm &s;tuffs. It is al&s;o fond of kitchen &s;toves when they are cooled &s;o much as to retain only a gentle warmth. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, it avoids &s;itting on hard bodies which quickly communicate cold, &s;uch as iron, marble, gla&s;s, &amp;c.; and in cold rainy weather, though in &s;ummer, it &s;hud|ders and trembles if water be thrown upon it. However, in &s;ultry days, it bathes of its own accord, and often dips its head in the water.</P>
<P>If one &s;troke it gently, it &s;preads its wings, and &s;quats; it then utters its di&s;agreeable cry, which re&s;embles the chatter of the jay, rai&s;ing its wings during the action, and bri&s;tling its
<PB N="172" REF="194">
feathers: and this habitual cry &s;eems to expre&s;s either plea&s;ure, or languor. Sometimes it has a &s;hort &s;hrill cry, which is le&s;s equivocal than the former, and denotes joy and &s;atisfaction; for it is generally addre&s;&s;ed to per&s;ons whom it loves; but this cry al&s;o marks its impatience, fits, and its petti&s;h gu&s;ts of ill-humour. But it is im|po&s;&s;ible to be preci&s;e on this &s;ubject; for birds organized like the Parrots perpetually vary or modify their voice, as they are prompted by imi|tation.</P>
<P>The Green Ara is jealous: it is fired at &s;eeing a young child &s;haring in its mi&s;tre&s;s's care&s;&s;es and favours; it tries to dart at the infant, but, as its flight is &s;hort and laborious, it only &s;hews its di&s;plea&s;ure by ge&s;tures and re&s;tle&s;s move|ments, and continues tormented by the&s;e fits till its mi&s;tre&s;s is plea&s;ed to leave the child, and take the bird on her finger. It is then over|joyed, murmurs &s;atisfaction, and &s;ometimes makes a noi&s;e exactly like the laugh of an old per&s;on. Nor can it bear the company of other Parrots, and if one be lodged in the &s;ame room, it will &s;trive to deprive it of every comfort. It would appear, therefore, that the bird can &s;uffer no rivals whatever in its mi&s;tre&s;s's favour, and that its jealou&s;y is founded on attachment; ac|cordingly it takes no notice when it &s;ees a dif|ferent per&s;on fondle a child.</P>
<P>It eats nearly the &s;ame things that we do. It is particularly fond of bread, beef, fried fi&s;h,
<PB N="173" REF="195">
pa&s;try, and &s;ugar; but it &s;eems to prefer roa&s;ted apples, which it &s;wallows greedily. It cracks nuts with its bill, and picks them dexterou&s;ly with its claws. It does not chew the &s;oft fruits, but &s;ucks them, by pre&s;&s;ing its tongue again&s;t the upper mandible; and, with re&s;pect to the harder &s;ort of foods, &s;uch as bread, pa&s;try, &amp;c. it brui&s;es or chews them, by pre&s;&s;ing the tip of the lower mandible upon the mo&s;t hollow part of the upper. But, whatever be the nature of its food, its excrements are always green, and mixed with a &s;ort of white chalky &s;ub&s;tance, as in mo&s;t other birds, except when it is &s;ick, and then they a&s;&s;ume an orange or deep yellow ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Like all the other Parrots, the Blue Ara u&s;es its claws with great dexterity; it bends forward the hind toe to lay hold of the fruits and other crumbs which are given to it, and to carry them to its bill. The Parrots, therefore, em|ploy their toes nearly as the &s;quirrels or mon|keys; they al&s;o cling and hang by them. The Green Ara almo&s;t always &s;leeps in this way, hooked to the wires of its cage. There is al&s;o another habit common to the Parrots, viz. they never climb or creep without fa&s;tening by the bill, with which they begin, and u&s;e the feet only as a &s;econd point of their motion.</P>
<P>The no&s;trils are not vi&s;ible in this Ara, as in mo&s;t of the other Parrots; in&s;tead of being placed in the uncovered part of the horn of the
<PB N="174" REF="196">
bill, they are concealed in the fir&s;t &s;mall fea|thers that cover the ba&s;e of the upper mandible, which ri&s;es and forms a cavity at its root when the bird makes an effort to imitate difficult &s;ounds: in &s;uch ca&s;es the tongue folds back at the tip, and recovers its &s;hape when it eats; a power not commonly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by birds which can only move it backwards or forwards in the direction of the bill. This little Green Ara is as hardy as mo&s;t of the other Parrots, or even more &s;o. It learns more ea&s;ily to prattle, and pronounces much more di&s;tinctly, than the Red or Blue Aras. It li&s;tens to the other Parrots, and improves be&s;ide them. Its cry is like that of the other Aras, only its voice is not near &s;o &s;trong, and does not articulate &s;o di&s;tinctly the &s;ound <HI>ara.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;aid that bitter almonds will kill Parrots, but I am not certain of the fact; I know, how|ever, that par&s;ley, of which they are very fond, if taken even in &s;mall quantity, is very perni|cious; as &s;oon as they eat it, a thick vi&s;cous li|quor runs from the bill, and they die in an hour or two.</P>
<P>It appears that there is the &s;ame variety in the Green Aras as in the Red; at lea&s;t Edwards has de&s;cribed a <HI>great Green Maccaw,</HI> which is thirteen inches long, and fifteen to the middle feather of the tail: the face was red; the quills of the wing blue, and al&s;o the lower part of the back and the rump. Edwards calls the colour
<PB N="175" REF="197">
of the under &s;urface of the wings and of the tail, <HI>dull orange,</HI> and it is probably the &s;ame with that dull bronze red which we perceived below the wings of our Green Ara; the feathers of the tail, in that of Edwards, were red above, and terminated by blue <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>P&s;ittacus Severus:</HI> "It is green; its cheeks naked; the quills of its wings and tail blue, below pur|pli&s;h."</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>The BLACK ARA. FOURTH SPECIES. <HI>P&s;ittacus Ater,</HI> Gmel. The <HI>Black Maccaw,</HI> Lath.</HEAD>
<P>THE plumage is black, with reflections of &s;hining green, and the&s;e mingled colours are much like tho&s;e of the ani. We can only indicate this &s;pecies, which is known to the &s;a|vages of Guiana, but which we have not been able to procure. It differs from the other Aras in &s;ome of its habits; it never approaches the &s;ettlements, but remains on the arid and barren &s;ummits of rocks and mountains. L&auml;et &s;eems to mention this bird by the name of <HI>Ararauna,</HI> or <HI>Machao,</HI> who&s;e plumage, he &s;ays, is black, but &s;o well mixed with green that, in the &s;un beams, it &s;hines admirably; the legs are yel|low,

<HEAD>THE AMAZONS and CRICKS.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall apply the name of <HI>Amazon Par|rots</HI> to all tho&s;e which are marked with red on the fan of the wing; they have re|ceived that appellation in America, becau&s;e they are brought from the country of the Amazons. We &s;hall appropriate the term <HI>Crick</HI> to tho&s;e which have no red on the fan, but only on the wing: this too is the name given by the &s;a|vages of Guiana to the&s;e Parrots. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed from Amazons by other properties al&s;o: 1. the plumage of the Amazons is &s;hin|ing, and even dazzling, whereas the green co|lour of the Cricks is dull and yellowi&s;h; 2. in the Amazons the head is covered with a fine and very bright yellow, but, in the Cricks, this yellow is dull and intermixed with other colours; 3. the Cricks are rather &s;maller than the Amazons, which are much &s;maller than the Aras; 4, the Amazons are exceedingly beauti|ful and rare, but the Cricks are the mo&s;t com|mon of the Parrots, and the mo&s;t inferior in point of beauty; they are exten&s;ively &s;pread, while the Amazons are hardly ever found, ex|cept at Para, and in &s;ome other countries bor|dering on the river of Amazons.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="200">
But the Cricks, having red on their wings, ought to be joined with the Amazons, of which this red forms the principal character: their na|tural habits are likewi&s;e the &s;ame; they fly in numerous flocks, perch in multitudes on the &s;ame &s;pots, and all &s;cream together &s;o loud that they may be heard at a great di&s;tance. They frequent al&s;o the woods, both tho&s;e on the mountains and tho&s;e which grow in the low grounds, and even the &s;wamps that abound with palms, ela&s;tic-gum trees, and bananas, &amp;c. and are fond of the fruit of the&s;e trees. They eat, therefore, a greater variety of fruits than the Aras, which commonly &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the pal|mettoes alone; but the&s;e dates are &s;o hard that they can hardly be cut; they are round, and as large as pippins.</P>
<P>Some authors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dutertre, <HI>Hi&s;t. des Antilles,</HI> t. II. p. 251.&mdash;Labat, <HI>Nouv. Voy aux Iles de l'Amerique,</HI> t. II. p. 159.</NOTE> have &s;aid that the fle&s;h of all the American Parrots contracts the odour and colour of the &s;ub&s;tances on which they feed; that it &s;mells of garlic, when they eat the fruit of the acajou; that it has the &s;cent of mu&s;k and of cloves, when they eat the fruit of the Indian wood; and that it receives a black tinge, when they live upon the fruit of the <HI>genipa,</HI> who&s;e juice, though at fir&s;t as limpid as water, be|comes as black as ink in the &s;pace of a few hours. They &s;ubjoin that the Parrots become very fat during the maturity of the mangroves,
<PB N="179" REF="201">
which yield excellent food; and la&s;tly that the &s;eeds of the cotton &s;hrub intoxicate them to &s;uch a degree, that they may be caught with the hand.</P>
<P>The Amazons, the Cricks, and all the other Parrots of America, con&s;truct their ne&s;ts in holes formed in decayed trees by the woodpeckers, and only lay two eggs twice a year, which the cock and hen hatch by turns: it is &s;aid that they never for&s;ake their ne&s;t, and per&s;i&s;t in hatching, though their eggs be handled and de|ranged. In the love &s;ea&s;on, they a&s;&s;emble and breed in the &s;ame haunt, and &s;earch their food in company; when their appetite is &s;atisfied they make a continual and noi&s;y babbling, &s;hift|ing their place ince&s;&s;antly, and fluttering from tree to tree, till the darkne&s;s of night and the fatigue of action invite to repo&s;e. In the morn|ing they are ob&s;erved on the naked branches, at &s;un-ri&s;e, and they remain quiet till the dew is dried from their plumage, and their warmth recovered; then they ri&s;e in a flock, with a noi&s;e like that of gray crows, but louder. They breed in the rainy &s;ea&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. de la Borde, King's Phy&s;ician at Cayenne.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The &s;avages commonly take the Parrots in the ne&s;t, becau&s;e they are more ea&s;ily reared and better-tamed. But the Caribbs, according to Labat, catch them al&s;o after they are old: they ob&s;erve the trees on which they perch in
<PB N="180" REF="202">
great numbers in the evening, and, after dark, they carry near the &s;pot lighted coals, on which they throw gum and green pimento; the birds are &s;uddenly involved and &s;tifled in thick &s;moke, and fall to the ground; the &s;avages then &s;eize them, tie their feet, and recover them from the &s;uffocation, by throwing water on the head <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Labat, <HI>Nouv. Voy. aux Iles de l'Amerique,</HI> t. II. 52.</NOTE>. They al&s;o bring down the Parrots without hurt|ing them much, by &s;hooting them with blunt arrows <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"The &s;avages of Bra&s;il have very long arrows, headed with a ball of cotton, for &s;hooting at Parrots." <HI>Belon.</HI></NOTE>. But the old ones thus caught are dif|ficult to tame. There is only one method of rendering them tractable; it is to blow the &s;moke of tobacco into their bill, which partly intoxicates them, and makes them gentle and pliant. If they grow mutinous again, the do&s;e is repeated, and thus in the cour&s;e of a few days their di&s;po&s;ition is &s;oftened. We can hardly form an idea of the envenomed temper of the wild Parrots; they bite cruelly without provo|cation, and will not quit their hold. The old birds never learn to prattle in perfection. To|bacco &s;moke is al&s;o u&s;ed to cure them of their noi&s;y di&s;agreeable cry.</P>
<P>Some authors <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch, &amp;c.</NOTE> alledge that the female Par|rakeets never learn to &s;peak; but this is a mi&s;|take: they are more ea&s;ily taught than the males, and even more docile and gentle. Of

all the American Parrots, the Amazons and the Cricks are the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of education, e&s;pecially when caught young.</P>
<P>As the &s;avages traffic with each other in the feathers of Parrots, they claim a certain number of trees on which the&s;e birds make their ne&s;ts. This is a kind of property from which they derive an income by &s;elling the Par|rots to &s;trangers, or by bartering the feathers with other &s;avages.

<HEAD>VARIETIES or CONTIGUOUS SPECIES of the YELLOW-HEADED AMAZON.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two other &s;pecies, or perhaps va|rieties, related to the preceding.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The Red and Green Parrot of Cayenne,</HI> which has not been mentioned by any natural|i&s;t, though known in Guiana by the name of <HI>Ba&s;tard Amazon</HI> or <HI>Half-Amazon.</HI> It is &s;aid to be a cro&s;s-breed of the Amazon with another Parrot. It is indeed inferior in beauty to the one ju&s;t de&s;cribed; for it has not the fine yellow on the face near the root of the bill; the green co|lour of its plumage is not &s;o brilliant, but has a yellowi&s;h ca&s;t; the red on the plumage is the only colour which is &s;imilar and di&s;po&s;ed in the

<P N="2">II.

In one &s;pecimen, the plumage was al&s;o of a deeper green, and le&s;s waved with black: in another, it was lighter, mixed with yellowi&s;h, and inter&s;ected with black fe&s;toons all over the body; the throat and the fore-&s;ide of the neck are of a fine red. That colour is not &s;o much &s;pread in the former, or &s;o bright, but there is a &s;pot of it under the belly.

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the AOUROU-COURAOU.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are &s;everal varieties which may be referred to this &s;pecies.</P>
<P N="1">I. The bird mentioned by Aldrovandus under the appellation of <HI>P&s;ittacus Viridis Melanorinchos,</HI> which hardly differs at all from the preceding.</P>
<P N="2">II. There is another al&s;o de&s;cribed by Aldro|vandus, in which the face is beryl blue with a bar of the &s;ame colour above the eyes, which is only a &s;hade different from the &s;pecies of this article. The crown of the head is al&s;o of a paler yellow; the upper mandible is red at the ba&s;e, blui&s;h in the middle, and black at the end; the lower mandible is whiti&s;h. In all other properties, the colours are preci&s;ely the &s;ame as in the <HI>Aourou-Couraou.</HI> It is found in Guiana, Brazil, and Mexico, and al&s;o in Ja|maica; and it mu&s;t be very common in Mexi|co, &s;ince the Spaniards give it a proper name, <HI>Catherina</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many beautiful kinds of Parrots are di&s;tingui&s;hed in New Spain; the <HI>caterinillas</HI> have their plumage entirely green; the <HI>loros</HI> have it green likewi&s;e, except the head and the extremity of the wings, which are of a fine yellow; the <HI>pericos</HI> are of the &s;ame co|lour, and are not larger than a thru&s;h." <HI>Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voy. t. XII. p.</HI> 626.</NOTE>. From Guiana it has probably been carried into Jamaica, which is at too great di&s;|tance from the continent to corre&s;pond with the excur&s;ions of the Parrots. Labat &s;ays that they cannot fly from one i&s;land to another, and that
<PB N="189" REF="213">
tho&s;e of the different i&s;lands may be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed. The Parrots of Brazil, Cayenne, and the re&s;t of the continent of America, which are &s;een in the i&s;lands, have been tran&s;ported thither, and few which are natives of the i&s;lands are found on the continent, on account of the dif|ficulty of the pa&s;&s;age; for a &s;trong current &s;ets out from the Bay of Mexico, &s;o that a ve&s;&s;el is carried in &s;ix or &s;even days from the continent to the i&s;lands, though it takes &s;ix weeks or two months to work back again.</P>
<P N="3">III. Another variety is the <HI>Aiuru-Curuca</HI> of Marcgrave. There is on the head a blue cap mixed with a little black, in the mid&s;t of which is a yellow &s;pot: this indication differs in no|thing from the de&s;cription which we have given. But the bill is a&s;h-coloured at the ba&s;e, and black at the end; this is the only &s;light variation.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Marcgrave notices another variety, and remarks that it is like the preceding; yet our nomenclators have ranged them in different &s;pe|cies, and even doubled the&s;e. The only dif|ference is that the yellow extends a little more on the neck.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>The Yellow-fronted Amazon Parrot</HI> of Bri&s;|&s;on <HI>(P&s;ittacus Amazonicus fronte lutea).</HI> The only difference is that the face is whiti&s;h, or pale yellow, but in the other it is blui&s;h; which is by no means &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate &s;pecies.</P>

<P>THE whole of the head, the throat, and the lower part of the neck, are of a very fine yellow; the under &s;ide of the body is of a &s;hin|ing green, and the upper &s;ide al&s;o green, but with a little mixture of yellow; the fan of the wing is yellow, whereas the &s;ame part is red in the Amazons; the fir&s;t row of the coverts

<P>This bird is living at pre&s;ent with Father Bougot, who has communicated to us the fol|lowing account of its di&s;po&s;ition and habits.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;It is very &s;u&s;ceptible of attachment to its ma&s;ter;</Q> it is fond of him, but requires frequent care&s;&s;es, and &s;eems di&s;con&s;olate if neglected, and vindictive if provoked. It has fits of ob&s;ti|nacy; it bites during its ill humour, and im|mediately laughs, exulting in its mi&s;chief. Cor|rection and rigorous treatment only harden it, and make it more &s;tubborn and wayward; gentle u&s;age alone &s;ucceeds in mollifying its temper.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The inclination to gnaw whatever it can reach, is very de&s;tructive in its effects;</Q> it cuts the cloth of the furniture, &s;plits the wood of the chairs, and tears paper, pens, &amp;c. And if it be removed from the &s;pot, its pronene&s;s to contradiction will in&s;tantly hurry it back. But this mi&s;chievous bent is counterbalanced by agreeable qualities, for it remembers ea&s;ily what it is taught to &s;ay. Before articulating it claps its wings and plays on its roo&s;t; in the cage it grows dejected, and continues &s;ilent; never prattles well, except when it enjoys liberty. It chatters le&s;s in winter than during the &s;ummer
<PB N="192" REF="216">
months, forgetting its food, when it never cea&s;es from morning to night.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;In its cheerful days it is affectionate, re|ceives and returns care&s;&s;es, and li&s;tens and obeys;</Q> though a peevi&s;h fit often interrupts the harmony. It &s;eems affected by the change of weather, and becomes &s;ilent; the way to re|animate it is to &s;ing be&s;ide it; it &s;trives by its noi&s;y &s;creams to &s;urpa&s;s the voice which excites it. It is fond of children; in which re&s;pect it differs from other Parrots. It contracts a pre|dilection for &s;ome of them, and &s;uffers them to handle and carry it; it care&s;&s;es them, and if any per&s;on then touches them, it bites at him fiercely. If its favourite children leave it, it is unhappy, follows them, and calls loudly after them. During moulting it is much reduced, and &s;eems to endure great pain; and that &s;tate la&s;ts near three months.</P>
<P>"Its ordinary food is hemp-&s;eed, nuts, fruits of all kinds, and bread &s;oaked in wine; it would prefer fle&s;h, but that diet makes it low &s;pirited and inactive, and, after &s;ome time, occa&s;ions its feathers to drop.

<P>The Crick is near a foot long from the tip of the bill to the extremity of the tail, and its wings, when clo&s;ed, extend a little beyond the middle of the tail; both the upper and under &s;ur|face are of a pretty light hand&s;ome green, par|ticularly on the belly and the neck, where the green is very brilliant; the front and the crown of the head are al&s;o of a plea&s;ant green; the cheeks are greeni&s;h-yellow; there is a red &s;pot on the wings, and their quills are black, terminated with blue; the two middle quills of the tail are of the &s;ame green with the back, and the outer quills, being five on either &s;ide, have each an oblong red &s;pot on the inner webs, and which &s;pread more and more from the inner quill to the outer one; the iris is red; the bill and feet whiti&s;h.</P>

<P>THIS Parrot is found in Guadaloupe, and was fir&s;t de&s;cribed by Father Dutertre.

<P>We have not &s;een this Parrot; it is not found at Cayenne, and it mu&s;t now be very rare in Guadeloupe, &s;ince none of the inhabitants of
<PB N="201" REF="225">
this i&s;land could give us any account of it. But this is not extraordinary; for as the i&s;lands ad|vance in population, the number of Parrots gradually decrea&s;es, and Dutertre remarks in particular, that the French coloni&s;ts commit great havock among the Violet-headed Cricks in the &s;ea&s;on of the maturity of the guavas, cachi|mans, &amp;c. when their fle&s;h is exce&s;&s;ively fat and juicy. He adds that they are of a gentle di&s;po|&s;ition, and ea&s;ily tamed: "We have two," &s;ays he, "which build their ne&s;t in a large tree a hundred paces from our hut; the male and fe|male &s;it alternately, and come one after another to the hut for food, and bring their young ones with them as &s;oon as the&s;e can leave the ne&s;t."</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve that, as the Cricks are the mo&s;t common kind of Parrots, and at the &s;ame time &s;peak the be&s;t, the &s;avages have amu&s;ed them&s;elves in rearing the&s;e, and in trying to va|ry their plumage. For that operation they u&s;e the blood of a &s;mall frog, which is very differ|ent from tho&s;e of Europe; it is only half the &s;ize, and of a fine azure colour, with longi|tudinal bars of gold: it is the hand&s;ome&s;t of all the frogs, and &s;eldom frequents mar&s;hes, but inhabits the &s;eque&s;tered fore&s;ts. The &s;avages take a young Crick from the ne&s;t, and pluck the &s;capular feathers and &s;ome of tho&s;e on the back; then they rub it with the frog's blood, and the new feathers which grow are no longer green, but fine yellow or beautiful red. The&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="226">
birds thus altered are called <HI>Tapired Parrots</HI> in France. The operation mu&s;t have been an|ciently in u&s;e among the &s;avages, for it is no|ticed by Marcgrave; tho&s;e which inhabit Gui|ana and the banks of the Amazons equally prac|ti&s;e it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. de M. de Gennes au detroit de Magellan. <HI>Paris,</HI> 1698, <HI>p.</HI> 163.</NOTE>.

<P>THE name is very applicable; for this Parrot whi&s;tles like the tapir, which is called <HI>maipouri</HI> in Cayenne; and though there is a va&s;t difference between that huge quadruped and this little bird, they utter &s;ounds &s;o exactly &s;i|milar, as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hable. It is found in Guiana, in Mexico, and as far as the Ca|raccas; it never comes night the &s;ettlements, but commonly lives in woods &s;urrounded with wa|ter,

or even among the trees which grow in the deluged &s;avannas. It has no other note than the &s;harp whi&s;tle, which it repeats often while on the wing, and it never learns to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds commonly a&s;&s;ociate in &s;mall bo|dies, but often without any tie of affection; for they fight frequently, and with rancourous ob|&s;tinacy.

The Maipouris require to be bred when young, and they would not repay the trouble of educating them, were not their plum|age &s;o beautiful, and their figure &s;o &s;ingular: for their &s;hape is very different from that of the Parrots, or even of the Parroquets; their body is thicker and &s;horter, their head much larger, their neck and tail extremely &s;hort; &s;o that they have an heavy unwieldy air. All their motions are &s;uitable to their figure; even their feathers are entirely different from tho&s;e of other Parrots and Parrakeets, being &s;hort, clo&s;e, and cohering to the body; &s;o that they &s;eem com|pre&s;&s;ed and glued artificially on the brea&s;t and on all the lower parts of the body.&mdash;The Mai|pouri is as large as a &s;mall Popinjay, and, for this rea&s;on perhaps, have Edwards, Bri&s;&s;on, and Linnaeus, cla&s;&s;ed it with the Parrots; but the

<P>THIS bird is called <HI>Sincialo</HI> at St. Domingo. It is not larger than a blackbird, but is twice as long, its tail being &s;even inches, and its body five. It is di&s;po&s;ed to chatter, and ea&s;ily learns to &s;peak, to whi&s;tle, and to mimic the cries of all the animals which it hears: the&s;e Parroquets fly in flocks, and perch on the clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t verdant trees; and as they are green them&s;elves, they can hardly be perceived. They make a great noi&s;e among the trees, many at once &s;creaming, &s;qualling, and chattering; and if they overhear the voice of men or other ani|mals, they cry the louder <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dutertre, <HI>t.

The&s;e birds, &s;ays Cate&s;by, feed upon the &s;eeds and kernels of fruits, particularly apples, and the grains contained in cypre&s;s cones.

<P>There is a third &s;ubject in the King's Cabi|net, which differs chiefly from the two pre|ceding in the&s;e re&s;pects: the tail is longer, and the three outer quills on each &s;ide have their outer webs and their tips white; the three exterior quills of the wing are marked with tran&s;ver&s;e &s;pots, that are alternately white and black at their margin; there is al&s;o a gold-green &s;hade, waving on the back and on the quills in the middle of the tail, which has not place in the preceding.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Their loves commence in April: they choo&s;e the hole of a tree, and line it with the du&s;t of worm-eaten wood;</Q> and this bed is as &s;oft as cotton or down.

They lay three or four eggs, which are white, and &s;omewhat &s;maller than tho&s;e of a pigeon.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;While the female hatches, the employ|ment of the male is to bring &s;upplies of food, to keep watch on a neighbouring bough, and to &s;ing.</Q> At other times he is &s;ilent and re&s;erved; but during incubation, he fatigues the echos with tho&s;e langui&s;hing &s;ounds, which how in|&s;ipid &s;oever they may appear to us, undoubt|edly &s;ooth the tedious occupation of his dear companion.</P>

<P>M. Koelreuter calls this bird <HI>Lanius</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Comment.

A broad &s;hort bill, and bri&s;tles around the lower mandible; &s;uch are the characters which it has in com|mon with the Curucuis. But the properties wherein it re&s;embles the cuckoos, that the legs are very &s;hort and feathered to the nails, which are &s;lender and di&s;po&s;ed in pairs, the one before and the other behind; that the nails are &s;hort, and &s;lightly hooked; and la&s;tly, the want of a membrane around the ba&s;e of the bill: all the&s;e differ from the characters of the rapacious tribe.</P>
<P>The Curucuis are &s;olitary birds which live in the heart of damp fore&s;ts, where they &s;ub&s;i&s;t on in&s;ects; they are never ob&s;erved to con&s;ort in flocks; they generally &s;it on the middle branches, the cock and hen on &s;eparate but adjacent trees, and call each other alternately, by repeating their hollow monotonous cry, <HI>ooroocoais.</HI> They never fly far, but only from tree to tree, and &s;eldom even do that; for they remain during the greate&s;t part
<PB N="254" REF="282">
of the day in the &s;ame &s;pot, concealed beneath the thicke&s;t boughs; where, though their voice is continually heard, yet, as they are motion|le&s;s, they can hardly be di&s;covered. They are clothed &s;o thickly with plumage, that they ap|pear larger than in reality; they would &s;eem to equal the bulk of a pigeon, though they have not more fle&s;h than a thru&s;h. But if their feathers be numerous and clo&s;e, they are weakly rooted, for they drop with the lea&s;t rubbing; &s;o that it is difficult to prepare &s;peci|mens for the cabinet. The&s;e birds are among the mo&s;t beautiful of South America. Fernan|dez &s;ays that the fine feathers of the Red-bel|lied Curucui were u&s;ed by the Mexicans in making portraits, a gaudy kind of paintings, and other ornaments which they wore at fe&s;ti|vals, or in battle <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Trogon Violaceus:</HI> "It is violet; its eye-brows bright yellow; its back and rump gold-green; its wings brown; its intermediate tail-quills blui&s;h-green, tipt with black."</NOTE>.</P>

of the toes, the form of the body, every property of the bird in &s;hort, is &s;o widely dif|ferent from tho&s;e of the Curucuis, that they ne|ver with propriety can be a&s;&s;ociated.</P>
<P>The &s;econd bird which Bri&s;&s;on has taken for a Curucui is one which Fernandez <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Trogon Mexicanus Varius,</HI> Bri&s;&s;.</NOTE> &s;ays is ex|ceedingly beautiful, and of the &s;ize of a pigeon; that it frequents the &s;ea &s;hore; and that its bill is long, broad, black, and a little hooked: this form of the bill is very different from what obtains in the Curucuis, a circum&s;tance alone &s;ufficient to exclude it from this genus. Fernandez &s;ubjoins that it does not &s;ing, and that its fle&s;h is unfit for eating; that its head is blue, and the re&s;t of its plumage blue, variegated with green, black, and whiti&s;h.

<P>The Touraco is as large as a jay; but its long broad tail &s;eems to increa&s;e its bulk: its wings are however very &s;hort, not reaching to the ori|gin of the tail.

The Aby&s;&s;i|nian Touraco has a blacki&s;h tuft, compact like a lock, and reflected backwards: the feathers on the forehead, the throat, and compa&s;s of the neck, are meadow green; the brea&s;t, and top of the back, are of the &s;ame colour, but with an olive tinge, which melts into a purple brown, heightened by a fine green glo&s;s; all the back, the coverts of the wings, and their quills next the body, and all tho&s;e of the tail, are coloured in the &s;ame way; all the primaries are of a fine crim&s;on, with a black indenting on the &s;mall webs, near the tip: we cannot conceive how Bri&s;&s;on &s;aw only four of the&s;e red feathers. The under &s;ide is dun gray, &s;lightly &s;haded with light gray.</P>
<P>The Touraco of the Cape of Good Hope dif|fers not from the Aby&s;&s;inian one, except that
<PB N="259" REF="288">
the tuft is of a light green, and &s;ometimes fringed with white. The neck is of the &s;ame green, which melts on the &s;houlders into a darki&s;h tint, with glo&s;&s;y green reflections.</P>
<P>We had a Touraco alive from the Cape, and were a&s;&s;ured that it lived upon rice. No other food was offered to it at fir&s;t, and this it would not touch, but grew fami&s;hed, and, in that ex|tremity, it ate its own excrements. During three days, it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted only on water and a bit of &s;ugar. But ob&s;erving grapes brought to the table, it &s;hewed a &s;trong appetite for them; &s;ome were given to it, which it &s;wallowed greedily. It di&s;covered in the &s;ame way a fondne&s;s for apples, and afterwards for oranges. From that time it was fed on fruit for &s;everal months. This &s;eemed to be the natural food, its curved bill not being in the lea&s;t adapted for collecting grain. The bill is wide, and cleft as far as under the eyes; the bird hops, but does not walk; its nails are &s;harp and &s;trong, its hold firm; its toes are &s;tout, and inve&s;ted with thick &s;cales. It is lively, and bu&s;tles much; it continually utters a weak, low, and hoar&s;e cry, <HI>cr&ecirc;u, cr&ecirc;u,</HI> from the bottom of its gizzard, without opening its bill. But &s;ometimes it has a very loud &s;cream, <HI>c&otilde;, c&otilde;, c&obreve;, c&obreve;, c&obreve;, c&obreve;, c&obreve;;</HI> the fir&s;t notes low, the others higher, rapid, and noi&s;y, with a &s;hrill and har&s;h voice. It vents this cry of its own accord, when it is hungry;
<PB N="260" REF="289">
but it may be made to repeat it at plea&s;ure, if one prompts it by imitation.</P>
<P>This beautiful bird was given to me by the Prince&s;s of Tingri, to whom my mo&s;t re&s;pect|ful thanks are due. It is even hand&s;omer than at fir&s;t, for it was in moult when I made the foregoing de&s;cription. At pre&s;ent, which is four months &s;ince that time, the plumage is re&s;tored with fre&s;h beauties; there are two white &s;treaks of &s;mall feathers, or &s;hort &s;ilky hairs, the one pretty near the inner corner of the eye, the other before the eye, and extend|ing backwards to the outer corner; between the&s;e two is another &s;treak of the &s;ame down, but of a deep violet ca&s;t; the upper &s;urface of the body and of the tail &s;hines with a rich pur|pli&s;h blue, and the cre&s;t is green and not fring|ed. The&s;e new characters di&s;po&s;e me to think that it does not re&s;emble the Touraco from the Cape of Good Hope &s;o much as I at fir&s;t &s;up|po&s;ed; it &s;eems al&s;o to differ in the &s;ame pro|perties from the Aby&s;&s;inian Touraco. We have therefore three varieties; but we cannot determine whether the diver&s;ity belongs to the &s;pecies or to the individual, whether it is pe|riodical or con&s;tant, or only &s;exual.</P>
<P>It does not appear that this bird is found in America, though Albin gives it as brought from Mexico. Edwards affirms that it is indige|nous in Guinea, from whence the individual
<PB N="261" REF="290">
mentioned by Albin was po&s;&s;ibly tran&s;ported into the new world. We are unacquainted with the habits of the bird, when it enjoys its native freedom; but as it is exceedingly beau|tiful, we may hope that travellers will ob&s;erve them, and communicate their remarks. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Per&s;a:</HI> "Its tail is equal; its head cre&s;ted; its body blui&s;h green; its wing-quills blood coloured."</NOTE></P>

female Cuckoo returned to the ne&s;t where &s;he had depo&s;ited her egg, and expelled or devoured the other young, that her own might fare the better: others fancied that the little pretender de&s;troyed its fo&s;ter-brothers, or rendered them victims to its voracity, by &s;eizing exclu&s;ively all the food provided by their common nur&s;e. Elian relates that the young Cuckoo, &s;en&s;ible that it is a ba&s;tard, or rather an intruder, and afraid of being betrayed by its plumage and treated as &s;uch, flies away as &s;oon as it can u&s;e its wings, and joins its real mother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nat.

Melancthon has le&s;t a fine harangue on the ingratitude of this bird.</NOTE>.&mdash;But it is ab&s;urd to impute crimes that are phy&s;ically impo&s;&s;ible. How could the young Cuckoo, which can hardly feed without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, have &s;trength &s;ufficient to devour a wood-pigeon, a lark, a yellow bunting, or a pettychaps? It is true, that, in &s;upport of the po&s;&s;ibility of the fact, the evidence of a grave author, Klein, may be
<PB N="266" REF="295">
adduced, who made the ob&s;ervation at the age of &s;ixteen. Having di&s;covered in his father's garden a pettychaps' ne&s;t with a &s;ingle egg, which was &s;u&s;pected to belong to a Cuckoo, he &s;uffered the incubation to proceed, and even waited till the bird was feathered. He then &s;hut both it and the ne&s;t in a cage, which he placed on the &s;ame &s;pot. A few days after he found the hen-pettychaps entangled in the wires of the cage, and its head &s;ticking in the throat of the young Cuckoo, which had &s;wallowed it through mi&s;take, while catching greedily at a caterpillar that was probably too near. To &s;ome accident of this kind the Cuckoo owes its bad name. But it is not true that it devours its nur&s;e, or its fo&s;ter brothers: for, in the fir&s;t place, its bill, though large, is too weak; the one mentioned by Klein could not cru&s;h the head of the pettychaps, and was choked by it; in the &s;econd place, to remove all objections and &s;cruples, I have decided the point by expe|riment. On the 27th of June, I put a young Cuckoo, which had been hatched in the &s;pring, and was already nine inches long, in an open cage, with three young pettychaps, which were not one quarter feathered, and could not eat without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Cuckoo, far from devouring them, or even threatening them, &s;eemed eager to repay its obligations to the &s;pe|cies. It &s;uffered the little birds, which were not in the lea&s;t afraid, to warm them&s;elves un|der
<PB N="267" REF="296">
its wings. On the other hand, a young owl, which had as yet only been fed, began of it&s;elf to eat by devouring a pettychaps, which was lodged with it. I know that &s;ome qualify the account by &s;aying that the Cuckoo &s;wallows the chicks ju&s;t as they bur&s;t from the &s;hell; and as the&s;e little embryos might be regarded as beings intermediate between eggs and birds, they might therefore be eaten by an animal which habitually feeds on eggs, whether hatched or not. But though this &s;tate|ment is le&s;s improbable, it ought not to be ad|mitted till it is evinced by ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;aliva of the Cuckoo, it is nothing el&s;e than a frothy exudation from the <HI>larva</HI> of a certain kind of gra&s;s&s;hopper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This in&s;ect is the <HI>Cicada Spumaria</HI> of Linnaeus. It inhabits Europe, and is frequent on brambles, withies, and gra&s;s &s;talks; it &s;ettles in the forking of the &s;talks, and evacuates numerous ve&s;i|cles, re&s;embling froth, under which the larva lies concealed. This &s;pittle, &s;o frequent in the fields, is termed in French <HI>ecume print-ann$ere,</HI> or &s;pring froth, and the in&s;ect which emerges is denomi|nated <HI>&s;auterelle-puce</HI> (gra&s;shopper flea), or <HI>cigale bedaude.</HI> This in|&s;ect, it is &s;aid, kills the Cuckoo by pricking it beneath the wing; which at be&s;t is only &s;ome mi&s;repre&s;ented fact.&mdash;This frothy &s;ub|&s;tance is well known in England by the name of <HI>Cuckoo-&s;pittle,</HI> or <HI>wood&s;are.</HI></NOTE>. Per|haps the Cuckoo was ob&s;erved to &s;eek the larva under this froth, which might give occa&s;ion to its being &s;uppo&s;ed to depo&s;it its &s;aliva; and as an in&s;ect was perceived to emerge, it would be imagined, that the &s;aliva of the Cuckoo engen|dered vermin.</P>

<P>The&s;e two &s;ingularities &s;eem to imply a third: it is that their moulting is &s;lower and more com|plete than in mo&s;t birds.

I mu&s;t own that the Marquis de Piolenc and another per&s;on a&s;&s;ured me that two Cuckoos which they reared and kept &s;everal years did not drop all their feathers in the winter: but as they remarked not the time, nor the duration, nor the quantity of the moult, we can draw no conclu&s;ion from the&s;e two ob&s;ervations.</NOTE>: 2. That, in general, the&s;e birds are very late in moulting, and con|&s;equently &s;low in re&s;uming their plumage, which is hardly re&s;tored on their appearance in the be|ginning
<PB N="273" REF="302">
of &s;pring; accordingly, their wings are then very weak, and they &s;eldom perch on lofty trees, but &s;truggle from bu&s;h to bu&s;h, and &s;ometimes alight on the ground, where they hop like the thru&s;hes. We may therefore &s;ay that, during the love &s;ea&s;on, the &s;urplus food is almo&s;t entirely &s;pent on the growth of the fea|thers, and can furni&s;h very little towards the reproduction of the &s;pecies; that, for this rea|&s;on, the female Cuckoo never lays above one egg, or at mo&s;t two; and that, as the bird has little abilities for generation, it has al&s;o le&s;s ar|dour for all the &s;ubordinate functions, which have the pre&s;ervation of the &s;pecies as their ob|ject, &s;uch as ne&s;tling, hatching, and rearing their young, &amp;c. which all originate from the &s;ame &s;ource, and are proportioned to it. Be|&s;ides, as the male in&s;tinctively devours birds' eggs, the female mu&s;t be careful to conceal hers; &s;he mu&s;t not return to the &s;pot where &s;he has depo&s;ited one, le&s;t the male di&s;cover it; &s;he mu&s;t therefore choo&s;e the mo&s;t concealed ne&s;t, and which is al&s;o the mo&s;t remote from his u&s;ual haunts; and if &s;he has two eggs, &s;he mu&s;t entru&s;t them to different nur&s;es: and thus &s;he takes all the precautions &s;ugge&s;ted by con|cern for her progeny, and yet carefully avoids betraying it through indi&s;cretion. Viewed in this way, the conduct of the Cuckoo will coin|cide with the general rule, and imply in the mother an affection for her young, and even a
<PB N="274" REF="303">
rational kind of concern, which prefers their intere&s;t to the tender &s;atisfaction of fondling and a&s;&s;i&s;ting them by her offices. The di&s;per&s;ion too of the eggs in different ne&s;ts, whatever be the cau&s;e, whether the nece&s;&s;ity of concealing them from the male, or the &s;mallne&s;s of the ne&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Per&s;ons of veracity have told me that they twice &s;aw two Cuckoos in a &s;ingle ne&s;t, but both times in the ne&s;t of a thro&s;tle: but the thro&s;tle's ne&s;t is larger than that of the pettychaps, of the willow-wren, or of the red-brea&s;t.</NOTE>, would alone render it impo&s;&s;ible for the female to hatch them. This fact is the more probable, as two eggs are often found completely formed in the ovarium, but very &s;eldom two eggs in the &s;ame ne&s;t. Be&s;ides, the Cuckoo is not the only bird which never builds; many &s;pecies of titmice, wood-peckers, king-fi&s;hers, &amp;c. come under the &s;ame de&s;cription. We have already &s;een that it is not the only one that lays in other's ne&s;ts; there is al&s;o another example of a bird which never hatches its eggs; the o&s;trich, in the torrid zone, depo&s;its its eggs in the &s;and, and the heat of the &s;un accompli&s;hes the deve|lopement of the embryos. It never lo&s;es &s;ight of them indeed, and guards them a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly; but it has not the &s;ame motives as the Cuckoo to conceal its attachment, and therefore does not take all the precautions which might ex|empt it from farther &s;olicitude. The conduct of the Cuckoo is not then an ab&s;urd irregularity, a mon&s;trous anomaly, a deviation from the laws
<PB N="275" REF="304">
of nature, as Willughby expre&s;&s;es it; it is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of e&s;tabli&s;hed principles, and the want of it would occa&s;ion a void in the general &s;y&s;tem, and interrupt the chain of phae|nomena.</P>
<P>What &s;eems to have a&s;toni&s;hed &s;ome natu|rali&s;ts the mo&s;t, is that attention which they term unnatural in the nur&s;e of the Cuckoo, which neglects its own eggs to cheri&s;h tho&s;e of a foreign, and even ho&s;tile bird. One of the&s;e, an excellent ornithologi&s;t, &s;truck with the appear|ance, has made a &s;eries of ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject: he took the eggs of &s;everal &s;mall birds out of their ne&s;ts, and in their place &s;ub&s;tituted a &s;ingle egg of a bird of a different kind, and not a Cuckoo; and he inferred from his expe|riments that, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, birds will hatch no &s;ingle egg but the Cuckoo's, which is therefore favoured by a &s;pecial law of the Creator.</P>
<P>But this conclu&s;ion will appear ra&s;h and pre|carious, if we attend to the following con&s;ider|ations: 1. the a&s;&s;ertion being general, one con|trary fact is &s;ufficient to overturn it; and for this rea&s;on, forty-&s;ix experiments made on twen|ty &s;pecies are too few: 2. It would require many more, and tho&s;e performed with greater nicety, to e&s;tabli&s;h a propo&s;ition which is an ex|emption to the general laws of nature: 3.

I. p. 167, note 32. The author of that note adds &s;ome details relative to the hi&s;|tory of our bird: "While one of the red-brea&s;ts was &s;triking with its bill the lower belly of the Cuckoo, this bird &s;hivered its wings with an almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible quiver, opened its bill &s;o wide that an|other red-brea&s;t, which a&s;&s;ailed it in front, drove its head &s;everal times into the cavity, without receiving any injury; for the Cuckoo was no way irritated, but &s;eemed to be in the condition of a fe|male under the nece&s;&s;ity of laying. In a little while the Cuckoo, being exhau&s;ted, began to totter, lo&s;t its balance, and turned on the branch, from which it hung by the feet, its eyes half-&s;hut, its bill open, and its wings expanded. Having remained about two mi|nutes in this attitude, con&s;tantly hara&s;&s;ed by the two red-brea&s;ts, it quitted the branch, flew to perch at a di&s;tance, and appeared no more. The female red-brea&s;t re&s;umed her incubation, and all her eggs were hatched, and formed a little family, that long lived at|tached to this di&s;trict." M. le Marquis de Piolenc al&s;o tells me in his letters of a Cuckoo being repelled by buntings.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="281" REF="310">
<P>It follows from the&s;e experiments, 1. That the females of many &s;pecies of &s;mall birds which hatch the Cuckoo's egg, hatch likewi&s;e other eggs along with their own: 2. That they often &s;it on the&s;e eggs in preference to their own, which they &s;ometimes entirely de&s;troy: 3. That they will hatch a &s;ingle egg, though it be not a Cuckoo's: 4. That they boldly drive off the fe|male Cuckoo, when they &s;urpri&s;e her dropping the egg in their ne&s;t: 5. La&s;tly, that they &s;ome|times eat this favoured egg, even in ca&s;es where it is &s;ingle and alone. But a more general and important con&s;equence is, that the in&s;tinct of hatching which &s;ometimes appears &s;o powerful in birds, is not determined by the kind or qua|lity of the eggs; &s;ince they often eat or break them, or &s;it on addle ones; they &s;it even on balls of chalk or wood, and &s;ometimes brood in the empty ne&s;t. When a bird hatches the egg of a Cuckoo, or of any other bird, &s;he follows therefore the general in&s;tinct; and it is unne|ce&s;&s;ary to recur to any &s;pecial appointment of

It is even &s;ingular that the young Cuckoos, which, when bred in the cage, require &s;everal months before they eat without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, can ever be rai&s;ed in the ne&s;ts of larks, which, as we have &s;een in their hi&s;|tory, be&s;tow only fifteen days on their educa|tion. But in the &s;tate of nature, nece&s;&s;ity, li|berty, and the proper choice of food, will con|&s;pire to unfold their in&s;tinct, and ha&s;ten their growth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I mu&s;t own that Salerne &s;ays, that this bird is fed whole months by its adoptive mother, which it follows crying ince&s;&s;antly for food.

Another con&s;equence is, that the eggs or young birds are frequently thru&s;t out of the ne&s;t; but, though expelled from their paternal abode, they &s;ometimes &s;urvive; for if they be &s;omewhat grown, if the ne&s;t be near the ground, and if the a&s;pect is favourable and the &s;ea&s;on mild, they find &s;helter under the mo&s;s or fo|liage, and the parents, without for&s;aking the intruder, continue to feed and watch them.</P>
<P>All the inhabitants of fore&s;ts a&s;&s;ert, that when the female Cuckoo has once depo&s;ited her egg in the ne&s;t which &s;he has &s;elected, &s;he re|tires to a di&s;tance, and &s;eems to forget her pro|geny; and that the male never di&s;covers the &s;malle&s;t concern in the matter.

He adds that the young Cuckoo con|&s;tantly an&s;wers to the call, whether in the woods or in a volery, provided it be not di&s;turbed by the &s;ight of a per&s;on. It is certain that the old
<PB N="285" REF="314">
ones can be enticed by imitating their call, and that they &s;ometimes chant in the vicinity of the ne&s;t; but there is no proof that the&s;e are the parents of the young bird.

<P>Mo&s;t ornithologi&s;ts agree, that in&s;ects are the chief part of the Cuckoo's food, and that, as I have already remarked, it is peculiarly fond of birds' eggs. Ray found caterpillars in its &s;to|mach; I have al&s;o perceived ve&s;tiges of veget|able &s;ub&s;tances, &s;mall beetles, &amp;c. and &s;ome|times pebbles. Fri&s;ch a&s;&s;erts that the young Cuckoos ought, in every &s;ea&s;on, to be fed in the morning and evening at the &s;ame time as in the longe&s;t days of &s;ummer. That author has al&s;o ob&s;erved the way in which they eat the in&s;ects alive: they lay hold of the caterpillar by the head, and, drawing it into their bill, they &s;queeze the juicy matter through the anus, and then &s;hake it &s;everal times before they &s;wal|low it. They al&s;o &s;eize butterflies by the head, and, pre&s;&s;ing with their bill, they cru&s;h the brea&s;t, and &s;wallow the whole together with the wings.

<P>Though &s;ubtle, though &s;olitary, the Cuckoos are &s;u&s;ceptible of a &s;ort of education. Many per|&s;ons of my acquaintance have reared and tamed them; they are fed with minced meat, either cooked or raw, with in&s;ects, eggs, &s;oaked bread, fruits, &amp;c. One of the Cuckoos thus bred knew its ma&s;ter, an&s;wered his call, followed him to the &s;port, perched on his fowling-piece, and if it found a black cherry tree on the road, it flew to it, and returned not till &s;atiated with the fruit; &s;ometimes it did not join its ma&s;ter again the whole day, but followed him at a di&s;|tance, &s;hifting from tree to tree: when at home it was permitted to run about, and to roo&s;t at night. The dung of this bird is white and abundant, which is a great inconvenience in its education; it mu&s;t be carefully guarded-again&s;t the cold during the tran&s;ition of autumn into winter: this is a critical period for the Cuckoo; at lea&s;t I lo&s;t at this time all tho&s;e
<PB N="292" REF="321">
which I tried to rear, and indeed many of other kinds.</P>
<P>Olina &s;ays that the Cuckoo may be trained for the cha&s;e like the &s;parrow-hawks and the falcons; but he is the only per&s;on who makes that a&s;&s;ertion, which, perhaps, as well as many other errors in the hi&s;tory of this bird, has its &s;ource in the re&s;emblance of its plumage to that of the &s;parrow-hawk.</P>
<P>The Cuckoos are generally diffu&s;ed in the an|cient continent; and though tho&s;e of America have different habits, many of them &s;till retain a certain family likene&s;s. The common kind appear only during &s;ummer in the colder tempe|rate climates, &s;uch as tho&s;e of Europe; and they re&s;ide in the winter only in the warmer coun|tries, &s;uch as tho&s;e of the north of Africa: they &s;eem to &s;hun both extremes alike.</P>
<P>When the Cuckoos alight on the ground, they hop, as I have remarked; but this &s;eldom happens: and even though it were not a&s;cer|tained by experience, we might infer it from the &s;hortne&s;s of their legs and thighs. A young Cuckoo, which I had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in the month of June, made no u&s;e of its legs in walk|ing, but crept on its belly, a&s;&s;i&s;ting its motion by means of its bill, like the parrot in climbing. When it clambered in its cage, I perceived that the large&s;t of the hind toes was turn|ed forwards, but was le&s;s u&s;ed than the two
<PB N="293" REF="322">
other anterior ones <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this habit be common to the &s;pecies, what becomes of the expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>digiti &s;can&s;orii,</HI> applied by many naturali&s;ts to the toes di&s;po&s;ed, as in the Cuckoo, two before and two behind?

<P>I have already &s;aid that the plumage of the Cuckoo is very &s;ubject to vary in different indi|viduals; and con&s;equently, in de&s;cribing the bird, we can do nothing more than give an idea of the colours and their di&s;tribution, &s;uch as they are mo&s;t commonly ob&s;erved. The greater number of the full-grown males, which were brought to me, re&s;embled much the one de|&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on; in all of them, the upper|&s;ide of the head and body, including the coverts of the tail, the &s;mall coverts of the wings, the great ones next the back, and the three quills covered by them, are of a fine a&s;h-colour; the great coverts of the middle of the wing are brown, &s;potted with rufous, and terminated with white; the mo&s;t remote on the back, and the ten fir&s;t quills of the wing are deep cine|reous, the in&s;ide of the latter being &s;potted with ru&s;ty white; the &s;ix contiguous quills brown, and marked, on both &s;urfaces, with rufous &s;pots, terminated with white; the throat and the fore-part of the neck are light cinereous; the re&s;t of the under&s;ide of the body is radiated tran&s;ver&s;ely with brown, on a dirty white ground; the fea|thers
<PB N="294" REF="323">
of the thighs the &s;ame, and falling on each &s;ide on the tar&s;us, like ruffles; the tar|&s;us clothed exteriorly with a&s;h-coloured fea|thers as far as the middle; the quills of the tail blacki&s;h, and terminated with white; the eight intermediate ones are &s;potted with white near the &s;haft on the in&s;ide; the two middle ones are &s;potted in the &s;ame manner on the outer edge, and the la&s;t of the lateral quills is barred tran&s;ver&s;ely with the &s;ame colour; the iris is che&s;nut, &s;ometimes yellow; the internal membrane of the eye is very tran&s;parent; the bill is black without, and yellow within; the corners of the bill are orange; the legs yellow, and a little yellow appears al&s;o at the ba&s;e of the lower mandible.</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;everal females which were very like the males; and in &s;ome I perceived, on the &s;ides of the neck, traces of tho&s;e brown &s;treaks mentioned by Linnaeus.</P>
<P>Dr. Derham &s;ays, that, in females, the neck is variegated with ru&s;ty, and the upper&s;ide of the body is of a darker ca&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A per&s;on of veracity a&s;&s;ured me that he &s;aw &s;ome of the&s;e in|dividuals of a browner cat. which were al&s;o larger: if they were females. this would be another point of analogy to the rapacious birds.

<PB N="295" REF="324">
of the male is always darker than that of the female; but the variation is &s;o great, that no certain di&s;crimination can be drawn.</P>
<P>In young Cuckoos, the bill, the legs, the tail, and the under&s;ide of the body, are nearly the &s;ame as in the adults, except that the quills are more or le&s;s retained in their tubes: the throat, the forepart of the neck, and the un|der&s;ide of the body, are barred with white and blacki&s;h; in &s;uch manner, however, that the blacki&s;h predominates on the anterior parts more than on the po&s;terior (in &s;ome &s;ubjects there is hardly any white under the throat); the upper|&s;ide of the head and body is beautifully varie|gated with blacki&s;h, white, and ru&s;ty, di&s;tri|buted &s;o that the ru&s;ty appears more on the middle of the body, and the white on the ex|tremities; there is a white &s;pot behind the head, and &s;ometimes above the face; all the quills of the wings are brown tipped with white, and &s;potted more or le&s;s with ru&s;ty and white; the iris is greeni&s;h gray, and the ground of the plumage is a very light a&s;h colour. It is pro|bable that the female &s;o hand&s;omely <HI>mottled,</HI> of which Salerne &s;peaks, was hatched the &s;ame year. Fri&s;ch tell us, that young Cuckoos rear|ed in the woods have a plumage le&s;s variegated, and more like the plumage of tho&s;e which are bred in the hou&s;e. If this be not the ca&s;e, we &s;hould at lea&s;t expect it; for dome&s;tication in general alters the colours of animals, and we
<PB N="296" REF="325">
might pre&s;ume that tho&s;e &s;pecies of birds which participate of that &s;tate, undergo a proportional change of colours. At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t own, that I could perceive no difference be|tween the young wild Cuckoos which I have &s;een (and I have &s;een many of them) and tho&s;e which I reared. Perhaps what Fri&s;ch examined were older than the dome&s;tic ones with which he compared them. The &s;ame author adds that the young males have a darker plumage than the females, and that the in&s;ide of their mouth is redder, and their neck thicker <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fri&s;ch &s;u&s;pects that the thickne&s;s of the throat, which is pecu|liar to the male, may have &s;ome relation to the cry of the males.

<P>The weight of a full grown Cuckoo, weigh|ed on the 12th of April, was four ounces two gros and a half; that of another, on the 17th of Augu&s;t, was about five ounces. But they are heavier in the autumn, being then much fatter, and the difference is not incon&s;i|derable. I weighed a young one on the 22d of July, who&s;e total length was near nine inches, and found it two ounces two gros; another al|mo&s;t as large, though much leaner, was only one ounce four gros, that is near one third le&s;s than the fir&s;t.</P>

<P>The oe&s;ophagus dilates, at its lower part, into a &s;ort of glandular &s;ac, parted from the &s;tomach by a contraction; the &s;tomach is &s;lightly mu&s;cu|lar on its circumference, membranous on its middle, and adhering by means of fibrous net|work to the mu&s;cles of the lower belly, and to the different parts which &s;urround it. It is be|&s;ides much &s;maller and better proportioned in a young bird reared by a red-brea&s;t or pettychaps than in one bred and tamed by man; in the lat|ter, the &s;tomach, being di&s;tended by exce&s;&s;ive feeding, is as large as a common hen's egg, and occupies all the anterior part of the cavity of the belly, from the &s;ternum to the anus, and &s;ome|times &s;tretches under the &s;ternum five or &s;ix lines <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> M&eacute;moires de l' Academic Royale des Sciences, <HI>ann&eacute;e,</HI> 1752, <HI>p.</HI> 420.

whole of the inte&s;tines; whereas in the wild Cuckoo, which I directed to be killed the in|&s;tant they were brought to me, it never ex|tended quite to the &s;ternum, but left uncovered, between its lower part and the anus, two cir|cumvolutions of the inte&s;tines, and three on the right &s;ide of the abdomen. I &s;hould add, that in mo&s;t of the birds which I di&s;&s;ected, nothing was required to be compre&s;&s;ed or di&s;placed in or|der to perceive one or two circumvolutions of inte&s;tines in the cavity of the belly on the right &s;ide of the &s;tomach, and one between the lower part of the &s;tomach and the anus. This differ|ence of conformation, therefore, con&s;i&s;ts but in degree, &s;ince, in the greater number of the winged tribes, not only is the po&s;terior &s;urface of the &s;tomach &s;eparated from the &s;pine by a por|tion of the inte&s;tinal tube which is interpo&s;ed, but the left &s;ide is never covered by any portion of the&s;e inte&s;tines; and this &s;ingle difference is far from proving that the Cuckoo is incapable of hatching, as an ornithologi&s;t alleges. It is not, probably, becau&s;e the &s;tomach is too hard, &s;ince the &s;ides being membranous, its ten&s;ene&s;s pro|ceeds from accident or repletion; nor is the rea|&s;on becau&s;e the bird avoids cooling its &s;tomach, which is le&s;s &s;hielded than that of other birds; for it is evident, that it would be much le&s;s li|able to be affected by cold, if employed hatch|ing than in fluttering and perching on trees. The nut-hatch has the &s;ame &s;tructure, and yet

<P>IT might be regarded as &s;ingular that the fi|gure and a&s;pect of a bird, which lives in the &s;tate of nature, &s;hould be &s;o incon&s;tant and va|riable. But as the Cuckoos never pair, they are &s;timulated only by vague and general ap|petite unre&s;trained by per&s;onal attachment, and contract irregular alliances; which has given ri&s;e to diver&s;ity in the bulk, in the &s;hape, and in the plumage, and which, in the opinion of many, has converted them into falcons, mer|lins, gos-hawks, &s;parrow-hawks, &amp;c.

With regard to the foreign Cuckoos, I find two which &s;eem to be varieties of the European kind, occa&s;ioned by the influence of climate; and perhaps I &s;hould add &s;everal others, if I had an opportunity of &s;urveying them more clo&s;ely.</P>

<HEAD>The FOREIGN CUCKOOS.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal characters of the European Cuckoo are, as we have &s;een, a large head, a broad wide bill, the toes placed two before and two behind, the legs feathered and &s;hort, the thighs &s;till &s;horter, the nails &s;lender and &s;lightly hooked, the tail long and con|&s;i&s;ting of ten tapered quills. It is di&s;criminated from the curucuis by the number of tail-quills, the&s;e being twelve, and particularly by the greater length of its bill, and the greater con|vexity of its upper mandible: it is al&s;o di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the barbus, by having no bri&s;tles round the ba&s;e of the bill. But the whole mu&s;t be received with a degree of lati|tude, nor mu&s;t we expect to find all the cha|racters exactly combined in each bird that ought to be cla&s;&s;ed with the Cuckoo of Europe. The various tribes of animals melt into each other, and no ab&s;olute limits can be a&s;&s;igned. It is enough if the birds which we &s;hall refer to the genus of the Cuckoos be more clo&s;ely related to it than to any other genus. Our object is to trace nature as &s;he actually exi&s;ts, not to form artificial arrangements; and to facilitate the pro|gre&s;s of knowledge, by conden&s;ing and abridg|ing the detail of facts, which &s;erves as the foundation. Among the foreign Cuckoos,
<PB N="304" REF="333">
therefore, we &s;hall meet with &s;ome &s;pecies that have even tails, as the &s;potted Cuckoo of Chi|na, that of the i&s;land of Pannay, the vourou|driou of Madaga&s;car, and a variety of the brown Cuckoo &s;potted with rufous, from the Ea&s;t Indies; with &s;ome, that are in &s;ome de|gree forked, &s;uch as the Cuckoo which has two long &s;hafts in&s;tead of the two outer quills; with others, which have the tail exceedingly tapered, like the widow birds, &s;uch as the &s;an|hia of China, and the cre&s;ted collared Cuckoo; with others, wherein it is only partly tapered, as the old-man with rufous wings from Caro|lina, which has only two pairs of quills taper|ed, and as a variety of the cre&s;ted jacobine from Coromandel, which has only the outer pair ta|pered, that is, &s;horter than the four other pairs, which are equal to each other in length; with others, which have twelve quills in the tail, &s;uch as the honey-guide of the Cape; with others, which have only eight, as the guira|cantara of Bra&s;il, if Marcgrave was not deceived in counting them; with others, which &s;pread their tail even when in a &s;tate of repo&s;e, as the Madaga&s;car coua, the gold-green and white Cuckoo of the Cape of Good Hope, and the &s;e|cond coukeel of Mindanao; with others, which have all the quills clo&s;e and imbricated, both the middle and lateral ones; with others, which have &s;ome hairs about the bill, as the &s;anhia, the honey-guide, and a variety of the greeni&s;h
<PB N="305" REF="334">
Cuckoo of Madaga&s;car; with others, which have a proportionally longer and &s;lenderer bill, as the tocco of Cayenne; with others, wherein the internal and po&s;terior toe is armed with a long &s;pur, like that of our larks, as the houhou of Egypt, the Cuckoo of the Philippines, the green Cuckoo of Antigua, the toulou and the ru&s;ty-white; and la&s;tly, with others, wherein the legs are more or le&s;s &s;hort, more or le&s;s feathered, or even without any feather or down. Even what is regarded as the mo&s;t fixed and certain character, I mean the di&s;po&s;ition of the toes, two placed before and two behind, is al&s;o liable to vary; &s;ince I have ob&s;erved, in the Cuckoo, that one of the hind toes &s;ometimes turns forwards, and others have found, in the owls, that one of the anterior toes &s;ometimes turns backwards; but the&s;e &s;light differences, far from confounding the genus of the Cuckoos, di&s;play the true order of nature; as they &s;hew the richne&s;s of her plans, and the ea&s;e with which they are executed; exhibiting the end|le&s;s variety of &s;hades, the infinite diver&s;ity of features which di&s;tingui&s;h the individual, and yet without obliterating the general family like|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is a remarkable circum&s;tance with regard to the tribe of Cuckoos, that the branch &s;ettled in the new world &s;eems le&s;s &s;ubject to the va|riations which I have mentioned, and retains a greater re&s;emblance to the European &s;pecies
<PB N="306" REF="335">
con&s;idered as the common trunk, and from which it was perhaps later &s;eparated. In fact, the European Cuckoo vi&s;its the northern coun|tries, and pu&s;hes its excur&s;ions as far as Den|mark and Norway, and con&s;equently might cro&s;s the narrow &s;traits which divide the con|tinents at the&s;e high latitudes: but it could much more ea&s;ily pa&s;s the i&s;thmus of Suez, or &s;ome narrow inlets, to &s;pread through Africa; and nothing could oppo&s;e or retard its progre&s;s into A&s;ia. In the&s;e countries, therefore, the &s;ettlement mu&s;t have been more early, and a greater deviation from the primitive &s;tock may be expected. Accordingly, though there are &s;carcely two or three exceptions or exterior ano|malies in fifteen &s;pecies or varieties found in America, there are fifteen or twenty in thirty|four &s;pecies that occur in A&s;ia and in Africa; and no doubt there are more, if all the Cuckoos were known, which is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e, that it is &s;till undecided whether, among &s;o many, there be one that drops its eggs in the ne&s;ts of other birds; we know only that many of the&s;e foreign kinds build their ne&s;t, and hatch their own eggs. But though we are com|monly acquainted with the &s;uperficial differences only, &s;ome general and radical ones mu&s;t ob|tain, e&s;pecially between the two branches &s;et|tled in the old and in the new world, which mu&s;t undoubtedly receive an impre&s;&s;ion from the climate. I have noticed that the American
<PB N="307" REF="336">
&s;pecies are in general &s;maller than tho&s;e of the old continent, probably owing to the &s;ame cau&s;es which check the growth and expan&s;ion of quadrupeds in the new world, whether tho&s;e be indigenous, or introduced. There are at mo&s;t two &s;pecies of Cuckoos in America of nearly the &s;ame &s;ize with ours; but the others exceed not our blackbirds and thru&s;hes. In Africa and A&s;ia, there are a dozen &s;pecies as large as the European, or larger, and &s;ome of them equal to hens in bulk.</P>
<P>This &s;tatement will I hope ju&s;tify the plan which I have adopted, of &s;eparating the Cuckoos of America from tho&s;e of A&s;ia and Africa. Time and ob&s;ervation, the two great &s;ources of inform|ation, are &s;till wanting to illu&s;trate the habits and economy of the&s;e birds, and to point out their true differences, external or internal, ge|neral or particular.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t remarkable ornament of this Cuc|koo is a &s;ilky tuft of a blui&s;h gray, which can be erected at plea&s;ure, but in the ordinary &s;tate lies flat on the head; there is a black bar on the eyes, which gives it a marked a&s;pect; brown predominates on all the upper parts, including the wings and the tail, but the middle quills, and almo&s;t all the coverts of the wings, the

<P>It is as large as a magpie; the bill fifteen or &s;ixteen lines; the legs &s;hort; the wings not &s;o long as in the ordinary Cuckoo; the tail about eight inches, con&s;i&s;ting of ten tapered quills, and exceeding the wings about four inches and a half <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the <HI>Cuculus Glandarius:</HI> "Its tail is wedge-&s;haped, its head &s;omewhat cre&s;ted, with a black bar on its eyes."</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THIS Cuckoo likewi&s;e mu&s;t be regarded as only half foreign, &s;ince it was &s;een once in Europe. The authors of the Italian Orni|thology inform us that in 1739 a male and fe|male of this &s;pecies ne&s;tled in the vicinity of Pi&s;a, and that the hen laid four eggs, which

It mu&s;t, therefore, be very different from the ordinary Cuckoo, which un|doubtedly never recur to incubation in our cli|mates.</P>
<P>The head is black, and ornamented with a tuft of the &s;ame colour, which lies backwards; all the upper &s;ide of the body, including the &s;u|perior coverts, is black and white; the great quills of the wings rufous, terminated with white; the quills of the tail are blacki&s;h, ter|minated with light rufous; the throat and brea&s;t are rufous; the inferior coverts of the tail are ru&s;ty; the re&s;t of the under &s;ide of the body white, and even the feathers on the lower part of the thigh, which de&s;cend to the tar&s;us; the bill is greeni&s;h-brown, and the legs green.</P>

<P>In the female (for I have no certain account of the male) the head and upper &s;ide of the neck are dull green, with poli&s;hed &s;teel reflections; the &s;uperior coverts of the wings are greeni&s;h rufous; the quills of the wings rufous, termi|nated with &s;hining green, except the two la&s;t, which are entirely of that colour, and the two or three preceding the&s;e, which are mixed with it; the back is brown, with greeni&s;h reflec|tions; the rump brown, and al&s;o the &s;uperior coverts of the tail, who&s;e quills are &s;hining green, with the glo&s;s of burni&s;hed &s;teel; the throat and all the under &s;ide of the body are ru&s;ty white, which is lighter under the belly than on the anterior parts, and on the flanks; the iris is bright red; the bill black, and the legs blacki&s;h.</P>
<P>Total length from fourteen inches and a half to &s;ixteen and a half; the bill &s;ixteen or &s;even|teen lines; the no&s;trils three lines, and very narrow; the tar&s;us twenty-one lines; the inner hind nail nine or ten lines; the wings &s;ix or &s;e|ven inches; the tail eight lines, con&s;i&s;ting of ten tapered quills, and exceeding the wings five inches.</P>

The bird de&s;cribed by Sonnerat in his Voyage to New Guinea, under the name of the <HI>green Antigua Cuckoo,</HI> re&s;embles the pre|ceding &s;o much, that what I have &s;aid equally applies to it: the head, the neck, the brea&s;t, and the belly, are of a dull green verging on black; the wings are of a deep brown rufous; the nail of the inner toe is more &s;lender, and perhaps rather longer; all its feathers are in ge|neral hard and &s;tiff; the webs are ragged, and each fibre is a new &s;haft, to which &s;horter fibres are attached. The tail does not indeed appear tapered in the figure, but this was perhaps an over&s;ight. This Cuckoo is hardly larger than that of Europe.</P>

<P>With regard to the colours of its plumage, we might &s;ay that there is a &s;ort of black hood thrown over a white tunic; the white on the lower part is pure and unmixed, but the black on the upper part is interrupted, on the edge of the wing, by a white &s;pot immediately below the &s;uperior coverts, and by &s;pots of the &s;ame

<P>IT is in the interior part of Africa, at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the Cape of Good Hope, that this bird is found, which is known by its &s;ingular in&s;tinct of pointing out the ne&s;ts of wild bees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to &s;ome travellers, the cry of this bird is <HI>wieki, wieki;</HI> and this word <HI>wieki</HI> &s;ignifies honey in the language of the Hottentots.

In the morning and evening it utters its cry, <HI>cherr, cherr, cherr,</HI> which is very &s;hrill, and

&s;eems to invite the hunters and others, who &s;earch for honey in the wilderne&s;s; they an|&s;wer it in a more hollow tone, and continue al|ways advancing: as &s;oon as it perceives them it flies onward, and hovers over the hollow tree where the &s;warm is lodged; if the hunters are too tardy in following it, it redoubles its cries, returns back to them, &s;tops and flutters about, to rou&s;e their attention. It omits nothing to in|duce them to profit by the little trea&s;ure which it di&s;covers, but which it probably could not enjoy without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of man; either becau&s;e the entrance into the ne&s;t is too narrow, or on ac|count of &s;ome other circum&s;tances. While the party are employed in plundering the honey, the bird &s;its in a neighbouring bu&s;h, watching ea|gerly and expecting its &s;hare of the booty, which is commonly left for it, though never in &s;ufficient quantity to &s;atiate its appetite, or extingui&s;h or blunt its ardour in this kind of pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>This is not the idle tale of a common tra|veller; it is the ob&s;ervation of an enlightened man, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the de&s;truction of &s;everal republics of bees, betrayed by this little &s;py, and who communicates an account of what he &s;aw to the Royal Society of London.

the &s;ame names. But Bri&s;&s;on, re&s;ting pro|bably on this remarkable difference in the length and conformation of the bill, has made this bird a di&s;tinct &s;pecies. This &s;eparation is the more proper, as it appears from clo&s;er in&s;pection that the plumage is not the &s;ame, and that even the white beard is wanting, which gave name to the preceding &s;pecies: be&s;ides, the Chevalier Lefebre De&s;hayes, who has ob&s;erved the Tac|co with attention, finds that its habits are dif|ferent from tho&s;e a&s;cribed by Sloane to the Rain-bird.</P>
<P><HI>Tacco</HI> is the u&s;ual cry of this Cuckoo, but is &s;eldom heard. It pronounces the fir&s;t &s;yllable hard, and de&s;cends a whole octave on the &s;e|cond; it never utters this till after it has given a jerk with its tail, which it commonly does when it &s;hifts its place, or perceives any one approach. It has al&s;o another cry <HI>qua, qua, qua, qua,</HI> but which is never heard unle&s;s it be alarmed by the &s;ight of a cat, or &s;ome other dangerous enemy.</P>

With regard to &s;nakes, it &s;eizes them by the head, and in proportion as the part &s;wallowed dige&s;ts, it &s;ucks up the re&s;t of the body, which hangs out from the bill. It is thus u&s;eful, &s;ince it de&s;troys the pernicious animals: it would prove of &s;till greater utility, could it be dome&s;|ticated; and this might be po&s;&s;ible, for it is not &s;hy, but even &s;uffers the young negroes to catch it in the hand, though it has a &s;trong bill, and could make a &s;tout defence.</P>
<P>Its flight is never lofty; it begins flapping with its wings, and, then &s;preading its tail, it &s;hoots along, or rather &s;kims than flies. It flutters from bu&s;h to bu&s;h, and hops from bough to bough: it even &s;prings upon the trunks of trees, to which it clings like the wood-peckers; and &s;ometimes it alights on the ground, and hops about like the magpye, always in pur&s;uit of
<PB N="350" REF="382">
in&s;ects or reptiles. It is &s;aid to exhale conti|nually a rank &s;mell, and that its fle&s;h is unpa|latable; which is very probable, con&s;idering the kind of &s;ub&s;tances upon which it feeds.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds retire in the breeding &s;ea&s;on into the depth of the fore&s;ts, and remain &s;o well con|cealed, that no per&s;on has ever &s;een their ne&s;t. One might almo&s;t be induced to &s;uppo&s;e that they have none, and that, like the European Cuckoo, they lay their eggs in other birds' ne&s;ts; but if this were the ca&s;e, they would differ from all the other American Cuckoos, which them&s;elves build and hatch.</P>
<P>The Tacco has no brilliant colours in its plumage, but it has always a neat and becom|ing air; the upper &s;ide of its head and body, in|cluding the coverts of the wings, is gray, which is pretty deep, with greeni&s;h reflections on the great coverts only; the fore &s;ide of the neck and brea&s;t is a&s;h gray, and over all the&s;e &s;hades of gray there is &s;pread a faint reddi&s;h tint; the throat is light fulvous; the re&s;t of the under &s;ide of the body, including the thighs, and the in|ferior coverts of the wings, are more or le&s;s of a lively fulvous; the ten fir&s;t quills of the wing are of a bright rufous, terminated with green|i&s;h brown, which, in the following quills, ap|proaches con&s;tantly to a ru&s;t colour; the two middle quills of the tail are of the colour of the back, with greeni&s;h reflections; the eight others are the &s;ame about their middle, dark brown,

<P>THIS Cuckoo is very noi&s;y; it lives in the fore&s;ts of Brazil, and makes them echo to its cry, which is louder than plea&s;ant. It has a kind of tuft, who&s;e feathers are brown, edged with yellowi&s;h; tho&s;e of the neck and wings are, on the contrary, yellowi&s;h, edged with brown; the upper and under &s;ides of the body are of a pale yellow; the quills of the wings are brown; tho&s;e of the tail brown al&s;o, but ter|minated with white; the iris is brown; the bill dun-yellow; the legs &s;ea-green.

<P>THIS Cuckoo is called the <HI>Laughing-bird,</HI> on account of its call; and for the &s;ame rea|&s;on, &s;ays Fernandez, it was reckoned unlucky by the Mexicans before the true religion was introduced among them. With regard to the Mexican name <HI>Quapachtototl,</HI> which I have contracted and &s;oftened, it alludes to the fulvous colour which is &s;pread over all the upper &s;urface of its body, and even on the quills of the wings; tho&s;e of the tail are al&s;o fulvous, but of a darker ca&s;t; the throat is cinereous, and al&s;o the fore-part of the neck and brea&s;t; the re&s;t of the un|der &s;ide of the body is black; the iris is white, and the bill blui&s;h black.</P>

<P>THE &s;ingular property of this Brazilian Cuckoo is, that there are long feathers on the head, which it can erect at plea&s;ure, and form a dou|ble tuft; and hence the epithet of <HI>horned,</HI> which has been be&s;towed by Bri&s;&s;on. The head is large, and the neck &s;hort, as u&s;ual in this ge|nus; all the upper &s;urface of the head and body is &s;ooty; the wings are the &s;ame, and even the tail, though this has a darker ca&s;t, and the fea|thers at its extremity are marked with a ru&s;ty white &s;pot, &s;haded with black, which melts in|to a pure white; the throat is cinereous, and &s;o is all the under &s;ide of the body; the iris is blood coloured; the bill yellowi&s;h green, and the legs cinereous.</P>

<P>I ADOPT the epithet <HI>Piaye,</HI> applied to this Cuckoo in the i&s;land of Cayenne; but I adopt not the &s;uper&s;tition which gave it birth: <HI>Piaye</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>devil</HI> in the language of the na|tives, and al&s;o <HI>prie&s;t,</HI> that is among an idolatrous people, <HI>mini&s;ter</HI> or <HI>interpreter of the devil.</HI> This obviou&s;ly &s;hews that it is looked upon as an un|lucky bird: for this rea&s;on the Indians and ne|groes are &s;aid to have an abhorrence of its fle&s;h; but may not its perpetual leanne&s;s and unpalat|able quality account for their aver&s;ion?</P>
<P>The Piaye is not &s;hy; it allows a per&s;on to get very near it, and does not fly away till the moment he is about to &s;eize it: its flight is compared to that of the king-fi&s;her; it com|monly frequents the banks of rivers, and lodges

It is nearly as large as a blackbird; the upper &s;ide of its head and body is purple che&s;nut, includ|ing the wings of the tail, which are black near the end, terminated with white, and the quills of the wings, which are terminated with brown; the throat and the fore part of the neck are al&s;o purple-che&s;nut, but of a lighter tinge, and which varies in different individuals; the brea&s;t and all the under &s;ide of the body are cinereous; the bill and legs are brown gray.</P>

Father Dutertre a&s;&s;erts, indeed, as the rea&s;on of that denomination, that it &s;eems to articulate the words <HI>petit bout de petun,</HI> which is fal&s;e and improbable; e&s;pecially as the Creoles of Cayenne have an appropriated de&s;ignation for its ordinary warble, <HI>Canary boiler,</HI> becau&s;e it re&s;embles the noi&s;e of a kettle boiling.

<P>THIS Ani is as large as a blackbird, but its large tail gives it a longer form; for this is &s;even inches, which is more than half the to|tal length of the bird: the bill is thirteen lines long, and ri&s;es nine lines and a half; it is black, and &s;o are the legs, which are &s;eventeen lines in height.

&s;mall edge of deep &s;hining green, which borders the feathers on the upper part of the back and the coverts of the wings, and which cannot be perceived at a certain di&s;tance, for then the bird appears entirely black. The female differs not from the male; they con&s;tantly keep in troops, and are of &s;o &s;ocial a di&s;po&s;ition that they lodge and lay their eggs together in the &s;ame ne&s;t. They con&s;truct it with dry &s;ticks, but u&s;e no lining; it is exceedingly wide, often a foot in diameter, and its capacity is &s;aid to be proportioned to the number of fellow-lodgers which they intend to admit. The females hatch in company, and five or &s;ix are often &s;een in the &s;ame ne&s;t. This in&s;tinct, which would prove u&s;eful in the cold countries, &s;eems to be at lea&s;t &s;uperfluous in the &s;outhern regions, where the ne&s;t will ea&s;ily pre|&s;erve its heat. It originates entirely from the impul&s;e of &s;ocial temper; for they are con&s;tantly together, both when they fly and when they repo&s;e and &s;ettle on the branches of trees as near as po&s;&s;ible to each other. In this &s;ituation they all warble in concert, and almo&s;t through the whole day; and their &s;malle&s;t troops con&s;i&s;t of eight or ten, and they &s;ometimes amount to twenty-five or thirty. They fly low, and to &s;hort di&s;tances; and hence they oftener alight among bu&s;hes and thickets than upon trees. They are neither timorous nor &s;hy, and never make any remote retreat.

<P>Since writing the above, I have received a letter from the Chevalier lefebre De&s;hayes con|cerning the&s;e St. Domingo birds, and I &s;hall here extract what he &s;ays with regard to the Mangrove Ani.</P>
<P><Q>"This bird," &s;ays he, &startq;&endq;is one of the mo&s;t common in the i&s;land of St. Domingo....</Q> The negroes give it different appellations, <HI>To|bacco end, Amangoua, Black Parrot,</HI> &amp;c..... If we attentively con&s;ider the &s;tructure of the wings of this bird, the &s;hortne&s;s of its flight, and the weight of its body compared to its bulk, we &s;hall not he&s;itate to conclude that it is a na|tive of the new world: how, with its feeble narrow wings, could it traver&s;e the va&s;t ocean that divides the two continents?... The kind is peculiar to &s;outh America. When it flies it &s;preads its wings; but its motion is not &s;o quick nor &s;o continued as the parrot's... It cannot
<PB N="368" REF="400">
with&s;tand the violence of the wind, and the hurricanes de&s;troy numbers of the&s;e birds.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;They inhabit the cultivated grounds, or &s;uch as have once been in the &s;tate of cultiva|tion, and they are never found in the lofty fo|re&s;ts.</Q> They feed on various &s;orts of &s;eeds and fruits, &s;uch as &s;mall millet, maize, rice, &amp;c. and when reduced to want, they eat caterpil|lars and &s;ome other in&s;ects. We cannot &s;ay that they have a &s;ong or warble; it is rather a whi&s;|tling or chirping: &s;ometimes, however, this becomes more varied, but it is always har&s;h and di&s;agreeable; it receives different inflexions ac|cording to the pa&s;&s;ions which incite it. If the bird perceives a cat, or other dangerous animal, it informs its companions by a very di&s;tinct &s;cream, which it prolongs or repeats until its apprehen&s;ions are quieted: its fears are mo&s;t re|markable when it has young, for then it flut|ters and beats about its ne&s;t. The&s;e birds live in &s;ociety, though they do not form into &s;uch large flocks as the &s;tares; they &s;eldom part from one another.... and even previous to their hatching, we &s;ee &s;everal males and females working together at the con&s;truction of the ne&s;t, and afterwards the females hatch be&s;ide each other, each &s;itting on her eggs and rearing her young. This harmony is the more admirable, &s;ince love commonly di&s;&s;olves all other ties but what it forms... Their amours commence early: in February the males ardently court
<PB N="369" REF="401">
the females, and in the following month the happy couple are bu&s;y in collecting materials for the ne&s;t.... The&s;e birds are more la&s;ci|vious than even &s;parrows; and, during the whole &s;ea&s;on of their ardour, they are much more lively and cheerful than at any other time... They breed in &s;hrubs, coffee-trees, bu&s;hes, and hedges; and they place their ne&s;ts in the cleft where the &s;tem divides into &s;everal branches... When &s;everal females a&s;&s;ociate together, the one readie&s;t to lay does not wait till the ne&s;t be completed, but &s;its on her eggs while the re&s;t are employed in enlarging the fabric. They employ a precaution which is unu&s;ual with other birds, viz. to cover their eggs with leaves and gra&s;s-&s;talks, as fa&s;t as they lay them.... And during incubation, they cover the eggs in the &s;ame manner, if they are obliged to leave them in que&s;t of food.... The females which thus hatch be&s;ide each other are not quarrel|&s;ome, like hens that breed in the &s;ame crib; they take their &s;tations in order: &s;ome, how|ever, before they lay, make a partition in the ne&s;t with &s;talks of herbs, to contain their own eggs; but if the eggs happen to be jumbled to|gether, one female hatches them indi&s;crimi|nately; &s;he collects them, heaps them, and co|vers the whole with leaves, &s;o as to diffu&s;e the heat equally, and prevent its di&s;&s;ipation... Yet each female lays &s;everal eggs... The&s;e birds build their ne&s;t very &s;olid, though rude, with
<PB N="370" REF="402">
the &s;mall &s;tems of filamentous plants, the branches of the citron trees, and other &s;hrubs; the in&s;ide only is covered with tender leaves that &s;oon wither; and upon this bed the eggs are depo&s;ited: the&s;e ne&s;ts are wide, and much rai&s;ed at the margin; &s;ometimes the diameter is more than eighteen inches, but its &s;ize de|pends on the number of females which it is de&s;|tined to receive. It would be difficult to decide with accuracy whether all the females contained in the &s;ame ne&s;t have each their male; perhaps the&s;e birds are polygamous, in which ca&s;e it would, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge the ne&s;ts, and thus, even without any friendly &s;ocial principles, they might be con&s;trained to unite in performing the work... The eggs are as large as tho&s;e of a pigeon; they are of an uniform beryl, and have none of tho&s;e little &s;pots on the ends, which are u&s;ual on mo&s;t of the eggs of wild birds... It is probable that the females hatch twice or thrice a year, according to circum&s;tances; if the fir&s;t &s;uc|ceeds, they do not make another till autumn; if on the contrary, the eggs are robbed, or eaten by &s;nakes or cats, they makes &s;econd, and towards the end of July, o$ during the cour&s;e of Augu&s;t, they hatch a third time: certain it is, that their ne&s;ts are found in the months of March, May, and Augu&s;t...

The nature of the food depends upon the &s;ea|&s;on, &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;ting of caterpillars, mag|gots, and in&s;ects, and &s;ometimes of fruits and &s;eeds, &s;uch as millet, maize, rice, and wild oats, &amp;c.....

<P>WE retain the name <HI>Houtou,</HI> which has been given by the natives of Guiana, &s;ince it is expre&s;&s;ive of the cry. Whenever the bird makes a &s;pring, it bri&s;kly and di&s;tinctly ar|ticulates <HI>Houtou;</HI> the tone is deep, and re&s;em|bles a man's voice: that character alone &s;uffi|ciently di&s;criminates the living bird, whether it be in the &s;tate of freedom or of dome&s;tication.</P>
<P>Fernandez, who fir&s;t noticed the Houtou, has inadvertently mentioned it by two different names, and this mi&s;take has been copied by all the nomenclators: Marcgrave is the only na|turali&s;t who has not been mi&s;led. It would &s;eem that Fernandez was deceived by the &s;ight of a mutilated &s;pecimen, which induced him to admit two &s;pecies; for the &s;ingle naked quill which he ob&s;erved could not be natural, &s;ince in all birds the feathers grow con&s;tantly by pairs, ju&s;t as other animals have two legs or two arms.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="405">
The Houtou is about the &s;ize of the magpie; it mea&s;ures &s;eventeen inches and three lines from the point of the bill to the end of the great quills of the tail; its toes are placed as in the king-fi&s;hers, the manakins, &amp;c. But it is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the&s;e, and even from all other birds, by the form of its bill, which, though proportioned to the body, is conical and incur|vated, and the edges of the two mandibles in|dented. This character would di&s;criminate the Houtou; but it has another more &s;ingular one peculiar to it&s;elf; to wit, near the ends of the two long quills of the middle of the tail there is a &s;pace of about an inch, ab&s;olutely bare or &s;haved, &s;o that the &s;haft is naked in that part. This appearance, however, belongs to the adult; for when the bird is young the&s;e quills are, like the other feathers, webbed their whole length. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed that this naked &s;pace is not a natural production, and that it is perhaps ow|ing merely to the caprice of the bird, which plucks the feathery fibres. But it is ob&s;erved that in young &s;ubjects the webs are continuous and entire, and as they grow up the&s;e become &s;horter by degrees, &s;o as at la&s;t to di&s;appear. We &s;hall not &s;top to de&s;cribe more particularly the plumage of this bird, for the colours are &s;o much intermingled that it would be impo&s;&s;ible by words to convey a di&s;tinct idea of them; they are al&s;o affected by age or &s;ex.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="406">
They are difficult to rear, though Pi&s;o a&s;|&s;erts the contrary; and as they feed upon in|&s;ects, it is not ea&s;y to choo&s;e what will &s;uit their ta&s;te. Tho&s;e caught old cannot be bred; they are extremely &s;hy, and refu&s;e all &s;u&s;te|nance. The Houtou is a wild &s;olitary bird, ne|ver found but in the gloomy rece&s;&s;es of fore&s;ts; it a&s;&s;ociates not in flocks, or even in pairs; it is almo&s;t continually on the ground, or among the low branches, for it never properly flies, but leaps nimbly, pronouncing &s;martly <HI>hou|tou.</HI> It is early in motion, and its cry is heard before the warble of the other birds. Pi|&s;o was ill informed when he &s;aid that it builds on lofty trees; for it never con&s;tructs a ne&s;t, nor does it ri&s;e to any con&s;iderable height: it is contented with &s;ome hole of the <HI>armadillos,</HI> of the <HI>cavies,</HI> or of other &s;mall qua|drupeds, which it finds on the &s;urface of the ground; it lines this with dry herb &s;talks, and there lays its eggs, which are generally two in number. The Houtous are common in the in|terior parts of Guiana; but they &s;eldom frequent the neighbourhood of plantations. Their fle&s;h is hard and unpalatable food. Pi&s;o is mi&s;taken too, in &s;aying that they live upon fruits. As this is the third time he has been mi&s;led, it is probable that he has applied the attributes of another bird to the pre&s;ent, which he de&s;cribes only from Marcgrave, and with which he was
<PB N="375" REF="407">
perhaps unacquainted; for it is certain that the <HI>Houtou</HI> is the &s;ame bird with the <HI>Guira-guai|numbi</HI> of Marcgrave, which is difficult to tame, which is unfit for eating, and which neither perches nor ne&s;tles upon trees, nor feeds on fruits. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the <HI>Rampha&s;tos-Momota:</HI> "Its feet are gre&s;&s;ory <HI>(i. e.</HI> the toes di&s;po&s;ed three before and one be|hind)."</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>The HOOPOES, the PROMEROPS, and the BEE-EATERS.</HEAD>
<P>COMPARISON is the great &s;ource of knowledge. When objects have many common properties, their contra&s;t throws mu|tual light; it points out the real differences which obtain, and de&s;troys tho&s;e fal&s;e analogies which are apt to be formed when they are viewed &s;eparately. For this rea&s;on, I have ranged in a &s;ingle article the general facts with regard to the three contiguous genera of the Hoopoes, the Promerops, and the Bee-eaters.</P>
<P>Our Hoopoe is well known by its beautiful double tuft, which is almo&s;t <HI>unique</HI> in its kind, &s;ince it re&s;embles no other, except that of the cockatoo: its bill is long, &s;lender, and incur|vated, and its legs are &s;hort. The black and white Hoopoe of the Cape differs from ours in &s;everal particulars, and e&s;pecially becau&s;e its bill is &s;horter and more pointed, as will be found in the de&s;criptions. But it ought to be referred to that genus, being more related to it than to any other.</P>
<P>The Promerops re&s;embles the Hoopoes &s;o much that, were we for a moment to adopt the principles of the &s;y&s;tem-makers, we &s;hould &s;ay that they are Hoopoes without the cre&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Huppes &s;ans Huppe.</NOTE>. But
<PB N="377" REF="409">
the fact is that they are rather taller, and their tail is much longer.</P>
<P>The Bee-eaters re&s;emble, in the &s;hortne&s;s of their legs, the Hoopoe and king-fi&s;her, more e&s;pecially the latter, by the &s;ingular di&s;po&s;ition of their toes, of which the middle one adheres to the outer as far as the third phalanx, and to the inner one as far as the fir&s;t phalanx only. The bill of the Bee-eaters, which is pretty broad and &s;trong at its ba&s;e, holds a middle rank between the &s;lender bills of the Hoopoes and Promerops on the one hand, and the long, &s;traight, thick, and pointed bills of the king-fi&s;hers on the other; but, on the whole, it ra|ther inclines to the former, &s;ince the Bee|eaters live upon in&s;ects like the Hoopoes and the Promerops, and not upon &s;mall fi&s;h like the king-fi&s;hers; and it is well known how much the force and conformation of the bill &s;erve to regulate the choice of the food.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;ome traces of analogy between the genus of the Bee-eaters and that of the king-fi&s;hers. In the fir&s;t place, the beautiful beryl, which is by no means common in the European birds, decorates alike the plumage of our king-fi&s;her and of our Bee-eater. In the &s;econd place, the greate&s;t number of the &s;pecies of Bee-eaters have their two middle quills of the tail projecting far beyond the lateral ones; and the genus of the king-fi&s;her contains al&s;o &s;ome &s;pecies in which the&s;e two middle quills project
<PB N="378" REF="410">
al&s;o. And in the third place, there are &s;ome &s;pecies of king-fi&s;hers in which the bill is a lit|tle incurvated, which, in this re&s;pect, re&s;em|bles that of the Bee-eaters.</P>
<P>On the other hand, how clo&s;e &s;oever the Bee-eaters and Promerops be related, nature, ever rich and unexhau&s;ted, has &s;till &s;eparated them; or rather &s;he has melted them into one another by imperceptible &s;hades. The&s;e intermediate birds incline &s;ometimes more to the one genus, and &s;ometimes more to the other; I &s;hall deno|minate them <HI>Merops.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e different birds, which re&s;emble each other in &s;o many re&s;pects, are &s;imilar al&s;o in point of &s;ize. The large&s;t &s;pecies exceed not the thru&s;hes, and the lea&s;t are &s;carcely &s;maller than the &s;parrows and the warblers. The ex|ceptions are few, and obtain equally in the dif|ferent genera.</P>
<P>With regard to climate, a di&s;crimination takes place. The Promerops inhabit A&s;ia, Africa, and America; and never occur in Europe: if they are natives of the old continent, they mu&s;t have migrated into the new by the north of A&s;ia. The Hoopoe is peculiar to the old world, and I may a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame thing of the Bee-eaters, though there is a bird termed the <HI>Cayenne Bee-eater:</HI> for ornithologi&s;ts who have frequently vi&s;ited that i&s;land have never &s;een this bird. And with regard to the two Bee-eaters depicted by Seba, the one from Brazil and the other from

In the&s;e they u&s;ually lay their eggs, and al&s;o in the holes of walls upon the mould or du&s;t which is u&s;ually collected at the bottoms of &s;uch cavities, but do not line it with &s;traw, as Ari&s;totle &s;ays. Yet there are &s;ome exceptions, at lea&s;t what are ap|parently &s;uch: of &s;ix hatches that were brought to me, four of them had no litter, but the two others had a very &s;oft bedding compo&s;ed of leaves, mo&s;s, wool, feathers <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the bottom of one of the&s;e ne&s;ts was more than two litrons of mo&s;s (a litron is a mea&s;ure, the 16th part of a bu&s;hel) fragments of May-flies, and &s;ome worms that had no doubt dropt from the bill of the mother or of her young.

&s;eeming di&s;parities may be reconciled; for it is very probable that the Hoopoe &s;ometimes lays her eggs in ne&s;ts that were, in the preceding year, occupied by woodpeckers, wrynecks, tit|mice, and other birds, which had lined them according to their different in&s;tincts.</P>
<P>It has been long &s;aid and often repeated, that the Hoopoe be&s;mears her ne&s;t with the excre|ments of the wolf, of the fox, of the hor&s;e, of the cow, and of all &s;orts of animals, not ex|cepting man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Salerne, Gerini, &amp;c. It is pretty &s;ingular that the an|cients, who regarded the Hoopoe as an inhabitant of the mountains, of the fore&s;ts, and of the de&s;erts, &s;hould impute to it the employing human excrements for its ne&s;t. This is another particular fact in|judiciou&s;ly generalized: the mother, in collecting the in&s;ects for her young among filth, might dirty her&s;elf, and &s;o pollute her ne&s;t; and &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers would thence conclude that this was a habit common to the whole &s;pecies.</NOTE>; and that &s;he does this with the view to defend her young by the loath&s;ome &s;tench <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It has al&s;o been &s;aid that her object was to di&s;pel the charms that might be ca&s;t upon her brood; for the Hoopoe was reckoned very &s;kilful in this way. She knew all the plants that defeat fa&s;|cinations, tho&s;e which give &s;ight to the blind, tho&s;e which open barred gates; which la&s;t is propped by a fable equally ab&s;urd. Aelian gravely relates that a man having three times in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion clo&s;ed the ne&s;t of a Hoopoe, and having remarked the herb with which the bird opened it, he employed the &s;ame herb with &s;ucce&s;s to charm the locks of the &s;tronge&s;t coffers. Death even does but heighten its virtues, and give them new energy; its heart, its liver, its brain, &amp;c. eaten, with certain magical incantations applied, &s;u&s;|pended to different parts of the body, occa&s;ioned plea&s;ant or fright|ful dreams, &amp;c. In England, it was formerly held an unlucky bird; and even at pre&s;ent, the people of Sweden regard its ap|pearance as a pre&s;age of war. The ancients had better rea&s;on, me|thinks, to believe that when it was heard to &s;ing before the time when they u&s;ually began to dre&s;s the vine, it promi&s;ed a good vin|tage: in fact, its early &s;ong would imply a mild &s;pring and a for|ward &s;ea&s;on, which is ever favourable to the maturity of the vine, and to the quality of its fruit.</NOTE>. But the fact is not more true than the intention; for the Hoopoe never pla&s;ters the mouth of its ne&s;t like the nuthatch. At the &s;ame time, the ne&s;t is indeed very dirty and of|fen&s;ive,

Hence undoubtedly the proverb, "Na&s;ty as a Hoopoe." But it is only in rear|ing its young that this bird can be accu&s;ed of na&s;tine&s;s; at other times it is very cleanly.

The mother has often been &s;een carrying food to the ne&s;tlings, but I never heard that the father paid them that attention. As the&s;e birds hardly ever appear in knots, it is mo&s;t likely that the family di&s;per&s;es as &s;oon as the brood are fledged; and this is the more probable, if, as the authors of the <HI>Italian Ornithology</HI> a&s;&s;ert, each pair makes two or three hatches in the cour&s;e of the year, tho&s;e of the fir&s;t hatch might fly as early as the end of June.&mdash;The&s;e are the few facts and con|jectures that I am able to offer in regard to the incubation of the Hoopoe and the education of its young.</P>

a hollow moaning, which foreboded rain; &s;ometimes a &s;hriller cry, indicating a fox in &s;ight, &amp;c. This character bears &s;ome analogy to the two voices of the tame Hoopoe men|tioned above.

<P>It is &s;aid that this bird never drinks at &s;prings or brooks; and that, for this rea&s;on, it is &s;el|dom caught in &s;nares. It is true that the Hoopoe killed in Epping Fore&s;t in England &s;hunned the numerous decoys laid for the pur|po&s;e of taking it alive; but the one which I have frequently mentioned had been caught in a net, and drank, from time to time, by plunging its bill with a bri&s;k motion, and with|out repeatedly lifting up its head, like many birds: it had probably a power of rai&s;ing the water into its gullet by a kind of &s;uction. The Hoopoes retain that bri&s;k motion of the bill even at other times, when they neither eat nor drink; this habit mu&s;t ari&s;e from their mode of living in the &s;avage &s;tate; catching in&s;ects, cropping buds, boring into the mud for worms, or perhaps for earthy liquor alone, and &s;earch|ing ants' ne&s;ts for the eggs. If they be difficult to en&s;nare, they are ea&s;y to &s;hoot; for they &s;uf|fer a per&s;on to come very near them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who have judged of the Hoopoe from mythology, have repre&s;ented it as very &s;hy, and as &s;eeking the heart of fore&s;ts and the &s;ummits of mountains, to avoid man.

though they fly with &s;udden jerks and in a tor|tuous cour&s;e, their motion is &s;low.

<P>They leave our northern climate about the end of Augu&s;t, or the beginning of autumn, and never &s;tay till the cold &s;ets in.

The&s;e Hoopoes, which are thus left behind, will continue to lodge in the &s;ame holes where they ne&s;tled; they will pa&s;s the winter in a half-torpid &s;tate, requiring little food, and being hardly able to repair the lo&s;s of feathers occa&s;ioned by moulting. Some hunters, di&s;covering them in that condition, have a&s;&s;erted that all the Hoopoes winter in hol|low trees, benumbed, and dive&s;ted of plum|age <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Albertus, and Schwenckfeld.

According to &s;ome, the Hoopoe was among the Egyptians e&s;teemed an emblem of filial piety; they took care, it was &s;aid, of their aged parents, cheri&s;hed them under their wings, and in ca&s;e of a tedious moulting, lent them a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in plucking the old feathers; they blew into their &s;ore eyes, and applied healing herbs, and in a word repaid all the endearments they had received in their tender infancy. Some|thing of this kind has been alleged of the &s;tork. Would to God that we could give the &s;ame amiable character of all other &s;pecies of ani|mals.</P>
<P>The Hoopoe lives only three years, accord|ing to Olina; but this mu&s;t be in the dome&s;tic &s;tate, where the term of life is abridged by im|proper food. It would be difficult to determine the extreme age of the free wild Hoopoe, par|ticularly as it is a bird of pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>As it has a great abundance of feathers, it appears thicker than in reality.

<P>The re&s;t of the cre&s;t, and all the fore part of the bird, are gray, verging &s;ometimes on wine colour, and &s;ometimes on rufous; the fore part of the back is gray, and the hind part is &s;triped tran&s;ver&s;ely with dirty white on a dark ground; there is a white &s;pot on the rump; the &s;uperior coverts of the tail are blacki&s;h; the belly and the re&s;t of the under &s;ide of the body are tawny white; the wings and tail are black &s;triped with white; the ground of the feathers is &s;late co|loured.</P>

<P>THE natives of Madaga&s;car call this bird <HI>Pa|tirich tirich,</HI> which is manife&s;tly formed from its cry, and which I have &s;hortened and retained. The principal colour of its plumage is dull green, changing into brilliant che&s;nut on the head, not &s;o dark on the upper &s;ide of the body, growing more dilute on the hind parts, &s;till lighter on the lower parts, and continually melting away towards the tail: the wings are terminated with blacki&s;h; the tail is dull green; the throat is yellowi&s;h white at its origin, and fine che&s;nut at its lower part. But what be&s;t characterizes this bird and gives it a &s;ingular a&s;pect, is a broad blacki&s;h bar, edged round its whole circumference with greeni&s;h white; this border bends about the ba&s;e of the bill and gra&s;ps the origin of the neck, a&s;&s;uming a yellowi&s;h tinge, as I have before &s;aid; the bill is black, and the legs are brown.

<P>A LITTLE accident which happened to a bird of this &s;pecies, long after it was dead, af|fords an in&s;tance of the mi&s;takes which are apt to embarra&s;s the nomenclature. It belonged to Mr. Dandridge, and was de&s;cribed, delineated, engraved, and coloured by two Engli&s;h natu|rali&s;ts, Edwards and Albin: a Frenchman, well &s;killed in ornithology, and though he had a &s;pecimen be&s;ide him, has &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e two figures have repre&s;ented two di&s;tinct &s;pecies, and has in con&s;equence de&s;cribed them &s;epa|rately and under different denominations.</P>
<P>The bird of Mr. Dandridge ob&s;erved by Ed|wards was one-third &s;maller than the European Bee-eater, and the two middle quills of its tail were much longer and narrower; the front was blue, there was a great &s;pot of the &s;ame colour on the throat, included in a &s;ort of black frame formed below by a half-collar like a rever&s;ed cre&s;cent, and above by a bar which pa&s;&s;ed over the eyes and de&s;cended on both &s;ides of the neck, &s;tretching towards the two extremities of the half collar; the upper &s;urface of the head and neck was orange; the back, the &s;mall coverts, and the la&s;t
<PB N="425" REF="460">
quills of the wings, were green, like the plumage of the parrot; the &s;uperior coverts of the tail were beryl blue; the brea&s;t and belly were light green; the thighs reddi&s;h brown; the inferior coverts of the tail dull green; the wings va|riegated with green and orange, and terminated with black; the tail of a fine green above and dark green below; the two middle quills ex|ceeding the lateral ones by more than two inches, and the projecting part deep brown and very narrow; the &s;hafts of the quills of the tail very brown, and &s;o were the legs; the bill, black above, and whiti&s;h below, at its ba&s;e.</P>
<P>In the &s;ubject de&s;cribed by Bri&s;&s;on, which is al&s;o delineated in the <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es,</HI> there was no blue on the front, and the green of the under &s;ide of the body partook of the beryl ca&s;t; the upper &s;ide of the head and of the neck was of the &s;ame gold green as the back; in general, there was a tint of gold yel|low thrown loo&s;ely on the whole of the plum|age, except on the quills of the wings and the &s;uperior coverts of the tail; the black bar did not extend acro&s;s the eyes, but be|low them. Bri&s;&s;on has remarked be&s;ides, that the wings were lined with fulvous, and that the &s;hafts of the tail, which were brown above, as in Edwards' bird, were whiti&s;h beneath. La&s;tly, there were &s;everal quills and coverts of the wings, and many quills of the tail, edged near the end and tipt with gold yellow. But it is
<PB N="426" REF="461">
obvious that all the&s;e minute differences are not more than might be expected in individuals of even the &s;ame &s;pecies, but only diver&s;ified by age or &s;ex; the &s;light variation of &s;ize may be imputed to the &s;ame cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The bird called by Bri&s;&s;on <HI>the little Philippine Bee-eater,</HI> is of the &s;ame &s;ize and plumage with the collared Bee-eater of Madaga&s;car; the chief difference remarked between them is, that in the former the two middle quills of the tail, in|&s;tead of being longer than the lateral ones, are, on the contrary, rather &s;horter. But Bri&s;&s;on him&s;elf &s;u&s;pects that the&s;e middle quills were not yet fully grown, and that in tho&s;e &s;ubjects where they were complete they projected far beyond the lateral ones: this is the more probable, as the&s;e two middle quills appear, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to be different from the lateral ones, and even nearly akin to the projecting part of the middle quills in the blue-throated green Bee|eater. The other differences are the&s;e; that the bar was not black, but of a dull green, and that the legs were brown red: but &s;till it ought to be referred to the &s;ame &s;pecies.

<P>M. de Montbeillard, author of this article, remarks with great ju&s;tice, that the names <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Tette-Chevre;</NOTE> <HI>Goat-&s;ucker,</HI> <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Crapand Volant;</NOTE> <HI>Flying-toad,</HI> <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Grand Merle;</NOTE> <HI>Great Black|bird,</HI> <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Corbeau de Nuit;</NOTE> <HI>Night Crow, and</HI> <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Hi|rondelle a Queue Carr&eacute;e.</NOTE> <HI>Square-tailed Swallow,</HI> ought to be re|jected as founded on prejudice and inaccurate ob&s;ervation. The fir&s;t of the&s;e appellations, though ancient and generally admitted, is highly improbable, and contradicted by fact; for Schwenckfeld made particular enquiries in a country where numerous flocks of goats are kept in folds, but could never di&s;cover that they were &s;ucked by any bird whatever. The other names ought equally to be rejected; it is &s;urely not a toad, or a blackbird, or a crow, or an owl. Nor is it even a &s;wallow, though much akin to it; for its external figure and its habits are different: its legs are &s;hort, its bill &s;mall, its throat wide; its food too, and its mode of prey|ing, are not the &s;ame. M. de Montbeillard adopts the appella|tion <HI>Engoulevent</HI> (guttler), given in &s;ome provinces of France, which, though vulgar, conveys a di&s;tinct idea of the bird in its &s;tate of activity; its wings &s;pread, its look haggard, its throat extended to its utmo&s;t width, and wheeling with a hoar&s;e buzzing noi&s;e in pur&s;uit of in&s;ects, which it &s;eems to <HI>guttle (engouler)</HI> by drawing in its breath.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

from Sweden, and even the more northern tracts, to Greece and Africa, on the one hand; and to India, and, no doubt, &s;till farther, on the other.

The commander de Godeheu informs us, that, in the month of April, the &s;outh we&s;t wind brings the&s;e birds to Malta <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Savans Etrangers, <HI>t.

They are at little trouble in forming their ne&s;t; they are content with any &s;mall hole which they hap|pen to find in the earth, or among &s;mall &s;tones, at the foot of a tree or the bottom of a rock. The female lays two or three eggs, larger than tho&s;e of the blackbird, and of a darker colour <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They are oblong, whiti&s;h, and &s;potted with brown, &s;ays M.

<P>The &s;ea&s;on when the&s;e birds appear mo&s;t fre|quent, is autumn; they fly nearly like the woodcock, and they have the ge&s;tures of the owl. Sometimes they tea&s;e and di&s;turb &s;port&s;|men who are on the watch. They have an odd
<PB N="440" REF="476">
&s;ort of habit, which is peculiar to them; they wheel an hundred times in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion round &s;ome large naked tree, with a very irregular and rapid motion; at intervals they dive bri&s;k|ly, as if to catch their prey, and then ri&s;e as &s;uddenly. In &s;uch ca&s;es they are undoubt|edly engaged in pur&s;uit of the in&s;ects that flut|ter about the aged trunks; but it is then difficult to get within gun-&s;hot of them, for they quick|ly di&s;appear, nor can their retreat be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>As the Goat-&s;ucker flies with its bill open, and with con&s;iderable rapidity, the air continu|ally &s;trikes again&s;t the &s;ides of its throat, and occa&s;ions a &s;ort of buzzing, like the noi&s;e of a &s;pinning-wheel: this whirring infallibly takes place whenever the bird is on the wing, but it varies according to the celerity of the flight. Hence the name of <HI>wheel-bird,</HI> by which it is known in &s;ome counties of England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author means Wales, where this bird is called <HI>Aderyny dr$ell,</HI> which in fact &s;ignifies <HI>wheel-bird.</HI> T.</NOTE>. But is this noi&s;e generally regarded unlucky, as Belon, Klein, and others who have copied them, a&s;|&s;ert? Or is it not rather a mi&s;take occa&s;ioned by confounding the Goat-&s;ucker with the white owl? When it &s;its, it utters its true cry, which is a plaintive tone repeated three or four times in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but we are not quite certain whether this is ever heard while the bird is on the wing.</P>
<P>It &s;eldom perches, and when it does, it is &s;aid

<P>I have &s;aid that the Goat-&s;ucker flies like the woodcock; their plumage al&s;o is &s;imilar, for all the upper &s;ide of the neck, of the head, and of the body, and even the under &s;ide, is gaily variegated with gray and blacki&s;h, with more or le&s;s of a ru&s;ty ca&s;t on the neck, the &s;capular feathers, the cheeks, the throat, the belly, the coverts, and the quills of the tail and wings; but the deepe&s;t &s;hades appear on the upper &s;ur|face of the head, of the throat, of the brea&s;t, on the fore part of the wings, and on their tips: there is &s;uch variety that the ideas would be lo&s;t in the <HI>minutiae</HI> of de&s;cription; I &s;hall there|fore only add the characteri&s;tic properties. The lower jaw is edged with a white &s;tripe that ex|tends behind the head; there is a &s;pot of the &s;ame colour on the in&s;ide of the three fir&s;t quills of the wing, and at the ends of the two or three outmo&s;t quills of the tail; but the&s;e &s;pots are peculiar to the male, according to Linnaeus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby ob&s;erved an individual in which the&s;e &s;pots were of a pale yellow, tinged with purple, and ob&s;curely marked: I perceived the &s;ame thing in two &s;ubjects; they are probably fe|males, and the one, which is &s;maller than the other, I judge to be younger.</NOTE>: the head is large; the eyes very

<HEAD>FOREIGN BIRDS, WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE GOAT-SUCKER.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is only one &s;pecies of this genus &s;ettled in the three divi&s;ions of the old continent; but ten or twelve are found in the new. We might therefore regard America as their original and chief abode, from which the European Goat-&s;ucker has been expelled by &s;ome fortuitous event: and as the colony ought ever to be &s;ubordinate to the mother-&s;tate, the order of nature would require that the Ameri|can &s;pecies &s;hould precede tho&s;e of Europe. This arrangement we would have followed; but a more cogent rea&s;on recommends a different plan. The order of the under&s;tanding is to proceed from what is well a&s;certained to what is more ob|&s;cure: we therefore begin with the European birds, which are be&s;t known to us, and which will tend to illu&s;trate tho&s;e of other climates; leaving to the American philo&s;ophers to begin their natural hi&s;tory (and would to God that they would compo&s;e one!) with the produc|tions of America.</P>
<P>The principal attributes of the Goat-&s;uckers are the&s;e: the bill is flat at its ba&s;e, the point being &s;lightly hooked, apparently &s;mall, but having a gape wider than the head, according
<PB N="444" REF="480">
to &s;ome authors; large protuberant eyes, like tho&s;e of nocturnal birds; and long black whi&s;k|ers about the bill: the effect of the whole gives it a dull, &s;tupid a&s;pect, and declares it a &s;loth|ful, ignoble race, allied to the martins and the nocturnal birds, and yet &s;o nicely characteri&s;tic, that it is ea&s;y at the fir&s;t &s;ight to di&s;tingui&s;h the Goat-&s;ucker from every other bird: their wings and tail are long, the latter &s;eldom forked, and then in a very &s;light degree, and is compo&s;ed of ten quills only: their legs are &s;hort, and, for the mo&s;t part, rough; the three fore toes are connected together by a membrane as far as the fir&s;t joint: the hind toe is moveable, and turns forward &s;ometimes; the nail of the middle toe is commonly indented on the inner edge: the tongue is pointed, and not divided at the end: the no&s;trils are tubulated, that is, the project|ing brims form on the bill the beginning of a &s;mall cylinder: the opening of the ear is wide, and probably its hearing is very acute; and we might even expect this to be the ca&s;e in a bird which has a weak &s;ight and hardly any &s;mell, for, the ear being thus alone capable of intimat|ing what pa&s;&s;es at a di&s;tance, the bird will na|turally be led to improve that organ. The pro|perties now enumerated are not, however, found in all the &s;pecies; &s;ome there are which have no whi&s;kers; others that have more than ten quills in the tail; others in which the middle nail is not indented; in &s;ome it is indented, not
<PB N="445" REF="481">
on the inner edge, but on the outer; in others the no&s;trils are not tubulated; in others the hind nail &s;eems incapable of being turned for|wards. But, what is common to all the &s;pe|cies, their organs of &s;ight are too delicate to &s;upport the light of day; and from this &s;ingle property are derived the chief circum&s;tances which di&s;criminate the Goat-&s;uckers from the &s;wallows. Hence they appear not till &s;un-&s;et in the evening, and retire in the morning a lit|tle after &s;un-ri&s;e; hence they live &s;olitary, di&s;|quieted by gloomy apprehen&s;ions; hence the difference of their cry; hence, too, in my opi|nion, is owing their not building a ne&s;t, for the weakne&s;s of their &s;ight does not permit them to choo&s;e and arrange, and interweave, the mate|rials. In fact, I know not of any bird that builds during the night, and the Goat-&s;ucker can, in our latitudes, have only three hours of twilight, which is entirely con&s;umed in pur&s;u|ing their humble fugacious prey. Of all the owls the eagle one is &s;aid alone to make a ne&s;t; and it the lea&s;t de&s;erves the appellation of noc|turnal bird, &s;ince it can fly to con&s;iderable di&s;|tances in broad daylight. The little owl, which hunts and catches &s;mall birds before the &s;etting and after the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, gathers only a few leaves, or &s;talks of herbs, and upon the&s;e drops the eggs in the holes of rocks or of old walls, La&s;tly, the long-eared, the white, the aluco, and the brown, owls, which of all the
<PB N="446" REF="482">
nocturnal birds are the lea&s;t capable of &s;upport|ing the light of the &s;un, lay al&s;o in &s;imilar cre|vices, or in hollow trees, but without any lin|ing, or &s;ometimes in the ne&s;ts of other birds which they find ready formed. And I might a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame thing in general of all birds who&s;e eye is exce&s;&s;ively delicate.</P>
<P>Another con&s;equence re&s;ulting from the too exqui&s;ite mechani&s;m of the organ of &s;ight, is that the Goat-&s;uckers, like the other nocturnal birds, have no brilliant colour in their plumage, and are denied even the rich varying glo&s;s which gli&s;tens on the &s;ober attire of the &s;wallow: black, and white, and gray, ari&s;ing from the mixture of the&s;e, and rufous, form the whole garb of the Goat-&s;uckers, and the&s;e are &s;o in|termingled that the general complexion is du&s;ky and confu&s;ed. They &s;hun the light, and light is the &s;ource of all the fine colours. Linnets, kept in the cage, lo&s;e that charming red which glowed in all its beauty when in free air they imbibed the direct influence of the &s;olar beams. It is not in the frozen tracts of Norway, or in Cimmerian &s;hades of Lapland, that we find the birds of paradi&s;e, the cotingas, the flamingos, the humming birds, and the peacocks; tho&s;e dreary neglected climates never produce the ruby, the &s;apphire, or the topaz. And la&s;tly, tho&s;e flow|ers which are forced at great expence in the hot-hou&s;e, acquire but a &s;ickly hue that cannot compare with the brilliant colours which a ver|nal

I conceive, therefore, that I am warranted to infer, that if a &s;eries of ob&s;ervations were made upon the plumage of birds, the wings of in&s;ects, and per|haps the hair of quadrupeds <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The plumage of the king-fi&s;her is much more brilliant be|tween the tropics than in the temperate zone, as we learn from For&s;ter, in Captain Cook's &s;econd Voyage.</NOTE>, tho&s;e &s;pecies

<P>THESE birds arrive in Virginia about the mid|dle of April, particularly in the back parts of the country.

<P>THOUGH Bri&s;&s;on makes no di&s;tinction be|tween the <HI>guira</HI> de&s;cribed by Sloane and the one de&s;cribed by Marcgrave, I conceive that they ought to be di&s;criminated and regarded as at lea&s;t varieties of climate: I &s;hall &s;tate my rea&s;ons when I treat of Marcgrave's Guira.

black; the belly and the &s;uperior coverts of the tail and of the wings, variegated with whiti&s;h; the quills of the tail and of the wings variegated with deep brown and white; the lower jaw al|mo&s;t featherle&s;s; the head, on the contrary, is over-charged with them; the eye-balls protrude from the &s;ocket about three lines; the pupil is whiti&s;h, and the iris orange.</P>
<P>This bird is found in Brazil; it inhabits the woods, lives upon in&s;ects, and flies only in the night.</P>
<P>Total length &s;ixteen inches; the bill two inches, and of a triangular &s;hape; its ba&s;e is three inches, &s;omewhat hooked, and edged with long whi&s;kers; the no&s;trils are placed in a pretty large groove; the throat is wide; the tar&s;us three lines; the alar extent thirty inches; the tail eight inches; the tongue &s;mall and tri|angular; the &s;tomach whiti&s;h, &s;lightly mu&s;|cular, containing half-dige&s;ted beetles; the li|ver red, divided into two lobes, the one on the right, and the other on the left; the inte&s;tines are rolled into many circumvolutions.</P>
<P>The Guira of Marcgrave has two very ob|vious characters which are not found in the de|&s;cription of Sloane, but which could not have e&s;caped &s;o accurate an ob&s;erver.

<P>WE have &s;een that the goat-&s;uckers may be reckoned night Swallows, and that the only e&s;&s;ential difference between them and the real Swallows con&s;i&s;ts in the exce&s;&s;ive deli|cacy of their eyes, and its influence on their &s;tructure and habits. In both tribes of birds the bill is &s;mall, and the throat wide; the legs &s;hort, and the wings long; the head flat, and the neck &s;carce vi&s;ible; and both live upon in|&s;ects which they catch in the air. But, 1. The Swallows have no bri&s;tles about the bill; the nail of the mid-toe is not indented; their tail contains two more quills, and, in mo&s;t of the &s;pecies, it is forked; and they are in general &s;maller than the goat-&s;uckers.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though the colours are nearly the &s;ame
<PB N="467" REF="503">
in both, con&s;i&s;ting of black, of brown, of gray, of white, and of rufous, they are di&s;po&s;ed in large &s;pots on the Swallows, and better con|tra&s;ted; and the plumage has a bright varying glo&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. The goat-&s;uckers entangle the night-flies with the vi&s;cous &s;aliva that trickles within their mouth; but the Swallows, and al&s;o the martins, &s;nap the winged in&s;ects, and the &s;ud|den clo&s;ing of their bill occa&s;ions a &s;ort of crack|ing noi&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Swallows are more &s;ocial than the goat-&s;uckers; they often gather in numerous flocks; and in certain circum&s;tances they lend mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as in building their ne&s;ts.</P>
<P N="5">5. In this con&s;truction they generally di&s;|play much attention and art; and if a few &s;pe|cies lay in the holes of walls, or in &s;uch as they form in the ground, they choo&s;e excavations of a &s;ufficient depth to afford protection for their young, and they provide whatever will contri|bute to convenience, warmth, and ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. The manner in which the Swallows fly differs in two principal points from that of the goat-&s;uckers. It is not attended with that whirring noi&s;e which I have before mentioned, becau&s;e the bill is not kept open: and though their wings &s;eem not better calculated for mo|tion, they wheel with much greater boldne&s;s, celerity, and continuance; becau&s;e the di&s;tinct|ne&s;s of their vi&s;ion permits them to exert all
<PB N="468" REF="504">
their force. They live habitually in the air, and perform their various functions in that ele|ment. The flight of the &s;wallow is perhaps le&s;s rapid than that of the falcon, but it is ea&s;ier and more unre&s;trained; the one darts forward with vigour, the other glides &s;moothly through the air: &s;he &s;hoots in every direction to &s;urvey, as it were, her aerial domain; and her &s;hrill &s;lender notes expre&s;s the cheerfulne&s;s of her condition: &s;ometimes &s;he pur&s;ues the fluttering in&s;ects, and nimbly follows their devious wind|ing tracks, or leaves one to hunt another, and &s;naps a third as it pa&s;&s;es: &s;ometimes &s;he e&s;capes the impetuo&s;ity of the bird of prey by the quick flexures of her cour&s;e. She can always com|mand her &s;wifte&s;t motion, and in an in&s;tant change its direction; and &s;he de&s;cribes lines &s;o mutable, &s;o varied, &s;o interwoven, and &s;o con|fu&s;ed, that they can hardly be pictured by words.</P>

By their habits: they arrive later and retire earlier, though they &s;eem to &s;hun more the heat; they breed in the crevices of old walls, and as high as they can get; they build no ne&s;t, but line the hole well with coar&s;e litter, in which re&s;pect they re&s;emble the bank|&s;wallows (&s;and-martins); when they go a-fo|raging, they fill their craw with winged in&s;ects of all kinds, &s;o that they need to feed their young only twice or thrice in the day. 3. By
<PB N="492" REF="528">
their di&s;po&s;itions: they are more &s;hy and timid than the Swallows; the inflections of their voice are le&s;s varied, and their in&s;tinct &s;eems more confined.</P>
<P>Such obvious differences, therefore, &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing between the&s;e birds, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to di&s;criminate them; but there are many fo|reign &s;pecies, which it would be difficult to refer each to its proper cla&s;s.

The fir&s;t ne&s;t, which was the lowe&s;t, had the &s;ame texture at the bottom as at the &s;ides; but the two upper tires were &s;eparated from the lower by their lining only, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;traw, dry herbs, and feathers.

<P>Though the Swallows are in general migra|tory, even in Greece and in A&s;ia, &s;ome will re|main during the winter, e&s;pecially in the mild climates where in&s;ects abound; for example, in the i&s;les of Hi&egrave;res and on the coa&s;t of Genoa, where they &s;pend the night in the open coun|try on the orange &s;hrubs, which they injure greatly.

<P>The&s;e birds have &s;ometimes been employed to convey important intelligence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Pliny, <HI>Nat. Hi&s;t. Lib.

In the males the orange tint on the throat is more vivid, and the white of the under &s;ide of the body has a &s;light ca&s;t of reddi&s;h.</P>
<P>The average weight of all tho&s;e which I have tried is about three gros. They are apparently larger than the window Swallows (martins), and yet they are lighter.</P>
<P>Total length &s;ix inches and a half; the bill forms a curvilineal i&s;o&s;celes triangle, who&s;e &s;ides are concave, and about &s;even or eight lines; the tar&s;us five lines, without any down; the nails thin, &s;lightly curved, and much pointed, and the hind one is the &s;tronge&s;t; the alar ex|tent, a foot; the tail three inches and a quar|ter, much forked, though le&s;s &s;o in the young birds, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve quills, of which the outer pair exceeds the next by an inch, and the middle pair by fifteen or twenty lines, and the wings by four or five lines; it is generally longer in the male.</P>
<P>I have received, as varieties, &s;ome in which
<PB N="503" REF="539">
the colours were all fainter, and the tail little forked; the&s;e were probably young ones.</P>
<P>Among the accidental varieties I place the following. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The white Swallows: there is no country in Europe where the&s;e have not been &s;een, from the Archipelago to Pru&s;&s;ia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Samos, according to the ancients; in Italy, in France, in Holland, in Germany, according to the moderns.</NOTE>. Aldro|vandus tells how to obtain them of that colour; according to him, we need only rub their egg with olive-oil. Ari&s;totle imputes this whitene&s;s to weakne&s;s of con&s;titution, want of food, and the action of cold. In a &s;ubject, which I had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, there were &s;ome &s;hades of rufous above the eyes and under the throat, and &s;ome traces of brown on the neck and the brea&s;t, and the tail was &s;horter; perhaps its faint colours were owing to moulting, for though white Swallows are frequently &s;een be|fore their pa&s;&s;age, it is unu&s;ual to find &s;uch on their return <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In a hatch of five young, at the Trinitarians of la Motte, in Dauphiny, were two white Swallows which pa&s;&s;ed the whole year in the country, but returned not the following year. <HI>Note of the Marquis de Piolenc.</HI></NOTE>. Some are ob&s;erved to be only partly white, as was the one mentioned by Al|drovandus, which had its rump of that colour.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, I con&s;ider as an acciden|tal variety, the rufous Swallow, of which the orange tint of the throat and eye-lids &s;preads over

Its bill is wider than that of the chimney-&s;wallow, at lea&s;t apparently &s;o, becau&s;e the mandibles open &s;uddenly as high as the ears, and the edges form on each &s;ide a pro|jection: la&s;tly, though it is &s;omewhat larger, it &s;eems rather &s;maller, its feathers, and e&s;pe|cially the inferior coverts of its tail, being not &s;o fully webbed. The average weight of all that I have weighed was con&s;tantly from three to four gros.</P>
<P>The rump, the throat, and all the under &s;ur|face of the body, are of a fine white; the &s;ide of the coverts of the tail is brown; the upper &s;urface of the head and neck, the back, tho&s;e of the feathers and of the primary coverts of the tail, are of a glo&s;&s;y black, with blue reflections; the feathers of the head and back cinereous at the ba&s;e, white in the middle; the quills of the wings brown, with greeni&s;h reflections on the borders; the three la&s;t of tho&s;e next the body are terminated with white; the legs clothed as far as the nails with a white down; the bill black, and the legs brown gray; the black of the female is le&s;s di&s;tinct, and its white not &s;o

pure, even variegated with brown on the rump. In the young ones the head is brown, and there is a &s;hade of the &s;ame colour under the neck: the reflections from the upper &s;urface of the body are of a lighter blue, which has a greeni&s;h ca&s;t in certain po&s;itions, and, what is remark|able, the quills of the wings are of a deeper tint. They frequently wag their tail upwards and downwards, and the origin of the neck is bare.</P>
<P>Total length five inches and a half; the bill &s;ix lines; the in&s;ide pale red at the bottom, blacki&s;h near the point; the no&s;trils round and open; the tongue forked, a little blacki&s;h near the end; the tar&s;us five lines and a half, covered with down rather on the &s;ides than before or behind; the middle toe &s;ix lines and a half; the alar ex|tent ten inches and a half; the tail two inches, forked as far as &s;ix, &s;even, or even nine lines; in &s;ome &s;ubjects this forking reaches only five lines, but in others it does not occur at all.</P>
<P>The inte&s;tinal tube &s;ix or &s;even inches; the <HI>caeca</HI> very &s;mall, and filled with a matter dif|ferent from that contained in the true inte&s;tines; it has a gall bladder; the gizzard is mu&s;cular; the <HI>ae&s;ophagus</HI> twenty lines, it dilates into a lit|tle glandular bag before its in&s;ertion; the te&s;ti|cles are of an oval &s;hape, and unequal; the greater diameter of the bigge&s;t ones four or five lines, the &s;maller diameter three; their &s;urface was marked with many circumvolutions, like

<P>What is &s;ingular, the young Martins are heavier than the adults: five that were taken from the ne&s;t while they were &s;carcely covered with down, weighed together three ounces, which give three hundred and forty-five grains to each; whereas both the parents weighed ex|actly an ounce, or each was two hundred and eighty-eight grains. The gizzards of the young birds were di&s;tended with food, and weighed in all one hundred and eighty grains, which was equal to thirty-&s;ix each; but both the gizzards of the parents, which contained hardly any thing, weighed only eighteen, or they were four times lighter than tho&s;e of their brood. This fact clearly proves that the parents neglect their requi&s;ite &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in order to &s;upply their young, and that, during infancy, the organs concerned in nouri&s;hment predominate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have ob&s;erved the &s;ame di&s;proportion both in the gizzards and in the inte&s;tines of young &s;parrows, nightingales, fauvettes, &amp;c.</NOTE>, as in the adult period tho&s;e &s;ub&s;ervient to generation.</P>

I have lately &s;een two that took their flight, the one from the pavement, and the other from a gravel walk: they did not walk at all, and never changed their place but by flapping their wings.</NOTE>. The Swifts have only two modes of life, that of violent exertion, or that of per|fect inaction; they mu&s;t either &s;hoot through the air, or remain &s;quat in their holes. The only intermediate &s;tate which they know, is that of clambering up walls and trunks of trees quite near their lodgment, and, by means of their bill, dragging them&s;elves into the cavity. Commonly they enter it full &s;peed, after having pa&s;&s;ed it and repa&s;&s;ed it above an hundred times; they dart in in an in&s;tant, and with &s;uch celerity that we totally lo&s;e &s;ight of them.</P>

<PB N="536" REF="573">
which widens into a larger cavity, and is pre|ferred in proportion to its height from the ground, as affording the &s;afe&s;t retreat. They ne&s;tle even in belfries and the talle&s;t towers, &s;ometimes under the arches of bridges, where, though the elevation is not &s;o great, they are better concealed. Sometimes they &s;ettle in hol|low trees, or in &s;teep banks be&s;ide the king|fi&s;hers, the bee-eaters, and &s;and-martins.

<P>The Swifts are, of all the birds of pa&s;&s;age, tho&s;e which arrive the late&s;t in our climates and retire the earlie&s;t: in general they begin to ap|pear about the end of April, or the beginning of May, and they leave us before the end of July <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am a&s;&s;ured, that on the lake of Geneva they arrive not till May, and retire about the end of July or the beginning of Au|gu&s;t; and when the weather is fine and warm, as early as the fif|teenth of July.</NOTE>. Their progre&s;s is more regular than

that of the other &s;wallows, and appears to be more affected by the variations of temperature. They are &s;ometimes &s;een in Burgundy as early as the twentieth of April, but the&s;e flocks pu&s;h farther; the &s;ettlers &s;eldom return to occupy their ne&s;t before the fir&s;t days of May <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year, 1779, though the &s;pring was uncommonly fine, they appeared not in the di&s;trict where I live till the fir&s;t of May, and returned before the ninth to the holes from which I had cau&s;ed their ne&s;ts to be taken.

They are noi&s;y on their appearance; rarely do two enter at once the &s;ame hole, and never without fluttering much about its mouth; &s;till more uncommon it is for a third to follow them, nor does it ever &s;ettle.</P>
<P>I have in different times, and in different places, opened ten or twelve &s;wifts' ne&s;ts: in all of them I found the &s;ame materials, and the&s;e con&s;i&s;ting of a great variety of &s;ub&s;tances; &s;talks of corn, dry gra&s;s, mo&s;s, hemp, bits of cord, threads of &s;ilk and linen, the tip of an ermine's tail, &s;mall &s;hreds of gauze, of mu&s;lin, and other light &s;tuffs, the feathers of dome&s;tic birds, tho&s;e of the partridge, and of the parrot, charcoal, in &s;hort, whatever they can find in the &s;weepings of towns. But how can birds which never alight on the ground gather the&s;e materials? A celebrated ob&s;erver &s;uppo&s;es that they rai&s;e
<PB N="538" REF="575">
them by glancing along the &s;urface of the ground, as they drink by &s;kimming clo&s;e on the water. Fri&s;ch imagines that they catch the &s;ub&s;tances in the air as they are carried up by the wind. But it is evident that little could be collected in the latter way, and, if the former were true, it would not fail to have been ob&s;erved in towns. I am inclined to think the account more proba|ble which &s;everal plain people have told me; that they have often &s;een the Swifts coming out of &s;wallows or &s;parrows' ne&s;ts, and carrying ma|terials in their claws. This ob&s;ervation is cor|roborated by &s;everal circum&s;tances; fir&s;t, the Swifts' ne&s;ts con&s;i&s;t of nearly the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tances with tho&s;e of &s;parrows; &s;econdly, we know that the Swifts enter &s;ometimes into the ne&s;ts of &s;mall birds to &s;uck their eggs, which we may &s;uppo&s;e they do for the &s;ake of pillaging the materials. With regard to the mo&s;s which they employ, it is in very &s;mall quantity, and they may gather it with their little claws, which are very &s;trong, from trees, on which they can clamber, and &s;ometimes even they breed in their hollow trunks.</P>
<P>Of &s;even ne&s;ts found under the head of a church porch fifteen feet from the ground, there were only three which had a regular cup-&s;hape, and of which the materials were more or le&s;s interwoven, and with greater order than u&s;ual in &s;parrows' ne&s;ts; they had al&s;o more mo&s;s,

<P>Soon after the Swifts have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ne&s;ts, &s;ome plaintive cries i&s;&s;ue continually from it for &s;everal days, and &s;ometimes during the night; at certain times, two voices may be di&s;tingui&s;hed. Is it the expre&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure common both to the male and female? or is it the love &s;ong by which the female invites the male to accompli&s;h the views of nature? The latter &s;eems to be the mo&s;t probable conjecture, e&s;pecially as the ardent cry of the male, when he pur&s;ues the female through the air, is &s;ofter and le&s;s drawling. We are uncertain whether the female admits one or &s;everal males: we often &s;ee three or four Swifts fluttering about the hole, and even &s;tretching out their claws to clamber on the wall; but the&s;e may be &s;uch as were hatched the preceding year, which &s;till remem|ber the place of their nativity.

<P>The&s;e birds, during their &s;hort &s;tay in our climates, have time only to make a &s;ingle hatch;

this con&s;i&s;ts of five white eggs, pointed, and of a &s;pindle &s;hape: I have &s;een &s;ome not yet hatch|ed on the twenty-eighth of May.

They carry provi|&s;ion only twice or thrice a-day; but each time that they return to the ne&s;t they bring ample &s;tore, their wide throat being filled with flies, butterflies, and beetles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The only Swift that M. Hebert could kill, had a quantity of winged in&s;ects in its throat. This bird catches the&s;e, according to Fri&s;ch, by darting impetuou&s;ly above them, with its bill wide &s;tretched.</NOTE>. They al&s;o eat &s;piders which they find near their holes; yet their bill is &s;o weak that it cannot even brui&s;e or hold that feeble prey.</P>
<P>About the middle of June the young Swifts begin to fly, and &s;hortly abandon their ne&s;ts, after which the parents &s;eem no more to regard them. At every period of their lives they are &s;ubject to vermin, but which appear little to in|commode them.</P>
<P>This bird, like all the re&s;t of the kind, is excellent for the table when fat; the young ones, e&s;pecially tho&s;e taken out of the ne&s;t, are reckoned, in Savoy and Piedmont, delicate mor&s;els. The adults are difficult to &s;hoot, be|cau&s;e they fly both high and rapidly; but as,
<PB N="541" REF="578">
on account of this very rapidity, they cannot readily alter their cour&s;e, they may, from this circum&s;tance, be hit not only by a fowling|piece, but al&s;o by the &s;troke of a &s;witch. The only attention required, is to place one's &s;elf in their way by mounting to a belfry, a ba&s;tion, &amp;c. and to meet them with the blow as they dart directly on, or as they come out of their hole <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many are killed in this way in the little town which I inhabit, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which breed under the church-porch that I have mentioned.</NOTE>. In the i&s;land of Zant the boys catch them with a hook and line; they place them|&s;elves in the windows of &s;ome high tower, and u&s;e a feather for bait, which the&s;e birds try to &s;natch and carry to their ne&s;t <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Perhaps al&s;o they mi&s;take the feather for an in&s;ect; they have an acute &s;ight, but the rapidity of their motion mu&s;t render objects le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hable.</NOTE>.

<P>The Swifts avoid heat, and, for this rea&s;on, they pa&s;s the middle of the day in their ne&s;ts in the crevices of walls or rocks and in the lowe&s;t row of tiles of tall buildings. In the morning and evening they go in que&s;t of provi&s;ion, or flutter without any particular object, but for exerci&s;e. They return at ten o'clock in the forenoon when the &s;un &s;hines, and again at half
<PB N="542" REF="579">
an hour after it &s;ets in the evening. They rove in numerous flocks, de&s;cribing an endle&s;s &s;eries of circles upon circles, &s;ometimes in clo&s;e ranks pur&s;uing the direction of a &s;treet, and &s;ometimes whirling round a large edifice all &s;creaming to|gether, and with their whole might; often they glide along without &s;tirring their wings, and, on a &s;udden, they flap with frequent and ha&s;ty &s;trokes. We behold their motions, but we cannot judge of their intentions.</P>
<P>A commotion may be perceived among the&s;e birds as early as the fir&s;t of July, which an|nounces their departure; their numbers increa&s;e con&s;iderably, and, in the &s;ultry evenings be|tween the tenth and twentieth, their large a&s;|&s;emblies are held. At Dijon, they con&s;tantly gather round the &s;ame belfries <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e of St. Philibert and of St. Benigne.</NOTE>; and, though the&s;e meetings are numerous, the Swifts appear as frequent as u&s;ual about the other edifices: they are probably foreign birds, therefore on their pa&s;&s;age to more &s;outhern climates. After &s;un-&s;et they divide into &s;mall bodies, &s;oar into the air with loud &s;creams, and fly quite differ|ently from ordinary. They may be heard long after they are gone out of &s;ight, and they &s;eem to bend their cour&s;e to the country; they no doubt retire at night to the woods, for there it is known they breed and catch in&s;ects, and that tho&s;e which haunt the plains during the day,
<PB N="543" REF="580">
and even &s;ome of tho&s;e which live in towns, repair to the trees in the evening, where they continue till dark. The city Swifts a&s;&s;emble &s;oon after, and all prepare to migrate into colder countries. M. Hebert &s;carce ever &s;aw them later than the 27th of July; he &s;uppo&s;es that they travel during the night, and proceed to no great di&s;tance, and cro&s;s not the &s;ea. In|deed their aver&s;ion to heat is &s;uch that they would &s;hun the &s;corching air of Senegal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What Ari&s;totle &s;ays of his <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which lived in Greece the whole year, would imply that it does not &s;o much dread heat. But may not the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> be our &s;and-martin?</NOTE>. Many naturali&s;ts <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Klein, Heerkens, Herman, &amp;c.</NOTE> pretend that they lie torpid in their holes during winter, and even before the end of the dog-days. But, in our climates, they are undoubtedly migratory, and in the ne&s;ts which I &s;earched, about the middle of April, twelve or fifteen days before their fir&s;t appearance, I could not find a &s;ingle bird.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the regular periodical migrations, we &s;ometimes &s;ee in autumn numerous flocks, which have by &s;ome accidents been &s;eparated from the main body. Such was the one that appeared to Hebert &s;uddenly in Brie about the beginning of November: it circled long round a poplar, and then began to &s;catter, ro&s;e to a great height, and vani&s;hed with the clo&s;e of the day. Hebert &s;aw another flock about the end of September in the vicinity of Nantua, where
<PB N="544" REF="581">
they are not common. In both the&s;e &s;tray|flocks there were many birds that had a cry dif|ferent from that u&s;ual to the Swifts; whether that their voice alters in winter, that they were young ones, or that they belong to a different branch of the &s;ame family.</P>
<P>In general, the Swift has no warble, but only a &s;hrill whi&s;tle, which varies little in its inflections, and which is &s;carce ever heard ex|cept when on the wing. In its hole it remains &s;till and &s;ilent, afraid, it would &s;eem, of di&s;clo&s;|ing its retreat: love alone rou&s;es it from le|thargy.

<P>Birds which &s;hoot through the air with &s;uch rapidity mu&s;t have a quick eye, and, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the fact corroborates the general principle advanced in the "Di&s;cour&s;e on the Nature of Birds." But every thing has its li|mits, and I cannot believe that they will de&s;cry a fly at the di&s;tance of half a quarter of a league, as Belon a&s;&s;erts; that is, at twenty-eight thou|&s;and times the fly's diameter, &s;uppo&s;ing that nine lines, or nine times farther than a man could &s;ee. The Swifts are not only &s;pread through
<PB N="545" REF="582">
all Europe; the Vi&s;count Querhoent &s;aw them at the Cape of Good Hope, and I doubt not that they may be found al&s;o in A&s;ia, and even in the new continent.</P>
<P>A moment's reflection will exhibit the &s;in|gularity of this bird: its life is divided between the extremes of motion and re&s;t; it never re|ceives the impre&s;&s;ions of touch, but during its &s;hort &s;tay in its hole; its joys are either exqui|&s;ite or totally &s;u&s;pended, nor can it have any idea of that languor which other beings feel from the dull continuance of even plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations; and, la&s;tly, its character is a com|pound of temerity and &s;u&s;picion. It creeps by &s;tealth into its hole like a reptile, and ob&s;erves profound &s;ilence; but when it circles in its pro|per element, it feels its &s;uperiority, and, tru&s;t|ing to its powers, it overlooks or de&s;pi&s;es danger.</P>
<P>The Swift is larger than our other &s;wallows, and weighs ten or twelve gros; the eye is hol|low, the throat a&s;h-white, the re&s;t of the plum|age blacki&s;h, with green reflections; the back and the inferior coverts of the tail are of a deeper ca&s;t; the&s;e coverts reach to the end of the two middle quills; the bill is black; the legs of a brown fle&s;h colour; the fore part and the in&s;ide of the <HI>tar&s;us</HI> are covered with &s;mall blacki&s;h feathers.</P>

<P>Having lately compared &s;everal Swifts of both &s;exes, I found that the males weighed more than the females, that their feet were &s;tronger,
<PB N="547" REF="584">
that the white &s;pot on the throat is broader, and that almo&s;t all the white feathers which form it have black &s;hafts.</P>
<P>The in&s;ect which infe&s;ts the&s;e birds is a kind of lou&s;e, of an oblong &s;hape, and orange colour, but of different tints; having two thread-like <HI>antennae,</HI> its head flat and almo&s;t triangular, and its body con&s;i&s;ting of nine rings, be&s;et with a few &s;traggling hairs.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat remarkable that during their &s;tay with us their plumage lo&s;es its black glo&s;s, and bleaches by continual expo&s;ure to the &s;un and the air.

<P>I FIND, in this bird, both the general qua|lities of the &s;wallow, and the peculiar cha|racters of the Swift. Its legs are extremely &s;hort; its four toes are turned forward, and con&s;i&s;t only of two <HI>phalanges;</HI> it never alights on the ground, and never perches on trees:&mdash;in the&s;e properties it agrees with the Swift: but there are con&s;iderable di&s;parities that &s;epa|rate it; for, be&s;ides the differences in the plum|age, it is twice as large, its wings are longer, and there are only ten quills in the tail.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds delight in mountains, and breed in the holes of crags. They appear annually among the cliffs which border the Rhone in Savoy, in tho&s;e of the i&s;land of Malta, in the Swi&s;s Alps, &amp;c. The one de&s;cribed by Ed|wards was killed on the rocks of Gibraltar; but it is uncertain whether it re&s;ides there, or was only on its pa&s;&s;age. And though it were a &s;ettler, this would not be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to call it <HI>Spani&s;h Swallow,</HI> as Bri&s;&s;on has done: for, 1. it is found in many other countries, and probably
<PB N="549" REF="586">
in all tho&s;e which abound with mountains and rocks. 2. It is rather a Swift than a &s;wallow. One was killed, in 1775, in our di&s;tricts on a pool, at the foot of a high mountain.</P>
<P>The Marquis de Piolenc (to whom I am in|debted for my acquaintance with the&s;e birds, and who has &s;ent me &s;everal) writes me that they arrive in Savoy about the beginning of April, and that they fly at fir&s;t over the pools and mar&s;hes, and in a fortnight or three weeks they reach the high mountains; that they do not fly &s;o lofty as the common Swifts, and that the time when they retire is not &s;o preci&s;e or fixed as that of their appearance, and depends much on the &s;tate of the weather, and on the warmth or chillne&s;s of the air <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the country of Geneva they remain a &s;horter time than the Swift or black Martin.</NOTE>: la&s;tly, he &s;ubjoins that they live on beetles, &s;piders, &amp;c. that they are difficult to &s;hoot, that the fle&s;h of the old ones is unplea&s;ant <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sport&s;men u&s;ually &s;ay that the&s;e birds are hard both to kill and to eat.</NOTE>, and that the &s;pecies is not numerous.</P>
<P>It is probable that the&s;e White-bellied Swifts breed al&s;o among the &s;teep rocks on the &s;ea-&s;ide, and that we may apply to them, as well as to the common Swifts, what Pliny &s;ays of certain birds without feet that fly in the open &s;ea at all di&s;|tances from the &s;hore, circling round the ve&s;|&s;els. Their cry is nearly the &s;ame with that of the common Swift.</P>

The whole of the upper &s;urface is brown|gray, but deeper on the tail and wings, with reddi&s;h and greeni&s;h reflections; the throat, the brea&s;t, and the belly, white; on the neck there is a brown-gray collar, variegated with black|i&s;h; the &s;ides are variegated al&s;o with blacki&s;h and with white; the lower belly and the infe|rior coverts of the tail are of the &s;ame brown with the back; the bill black; the legs fle&s;h coloured, covered with down before and on the in&s;ide; the ground of the feathers brown be|neath the body, and light gray above; almo&s;t all the white feathers have a black &s;haft, and the brown ones are edged delicately with whiti&s;h at the tip. In one male which I ob&s;erved, the feathers on the head were deeper coloured than in two others with which I compared it: it weighed two ounces five gros.</P>
<P>Total length eight inches; the bill an inch, &s;lightly hooked; the tongue four lines, of a tri|angular &s;hape; the iris brown; the eye-lids naked; the tar&s;us five lines and a half; the nails &s;trong, the inner one the &s;horte&s;t; the alar ex|tent above twenty inches; the wings compo&s;ed of eighteen quills; the tail three inches and a half, con&s;i&s;ting of ten unequal quills, forked eight or nine lines, and exceeded by the lines two inches at lea&s;t.</P>

It appeared to me that the me&s;entery was &s;trong|er, the &s;kin thicker, the mu&s;cles more ela&s;tic, and the brain firmer, than in other birds: every thing denoted &s;trength, and indeed the &s;wiftne&s;s of its motion nece&s;&s;arily implies that.</P>

There is a cu|rious remark made by Hag&s;troem in his <HI>Swedi&s;h Lapland,</HI> that corroborates this remark: he re|lates that many birds and other animals, whe|ther from a predilection to human &s;ociety or from views of intere&s;t, gather near the new &s;et|tlements; he excepts, however, the gee&s;e and ducks, who ob&s;erve a different conduct, and, both in the mountains and in the vallies, lead their migrations in a direction oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of the Laplanders.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude by remarking with Bajon and many other ob&s;ervers, that, in the i&s;lands and con|tinent of America, there is often a great difference between the plumage of the male and female of the &s;ame &s;pecies, and often a &s;till greater in the

<P>THIS is a new &s;pecies which we received from the i&s;land of Cayenne. We have ranged it with the Swifts, becau&s;e it has the four toes turned forward.</P>
<P>The collar which di&s;tingui&s;hes it is of a pure white, and very con&s;picuous on the blui&s;h black, which is the prevailing colour of its plumage.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;In 1741 I embarked in the &s;hip Mars, bound for China, and in the month of July, the &s;ame year, we reached the &s;traits of Sunda, very near Java, and between two &s;mall i&s;lets, called the <HI>Great and Little Tocque.</HI></Q> We were there becalmed, and went a&s;hore on Little Tocque to hunt green pigeons.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Since that time I have ob&s;erved, in &s;everal voyages,</Q> that, in the months of March and April, the &s;eas which extend from Java to Cochin-China, and from the promontory of Sumatra to New Guinea, are covered with fi&s;h-&s;pawn, which floats on the water like &s;trong glue half-melted. I have learnt from the Malays, the Cochin-Chine&s;e, and from the natives of the Philippines and Moluccas, that this is the &s;ub&s;tance of which the <HI>Sa|langane</HI> con&s;tructs its ne&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It gathers the &s;pawn either by razing the &s;urface of the &s;ea, or by alighting on the rocks on which it is ca&s;t and coagulated. Sometimes threads of this vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance are &s;een hanging at the bills of the&s;e birds, and which have been &s;uppo&s;ed, but without foundation, to be extracted from their &s;tomach in the love-&s;ea&s;on.</NOTE>. They all agree in
<PB N="574" REF="611">
this account. On pa&s;&s;ing the Moluccas in April and the &s;traits of Sunda in March, I fi&s;hed up &s;ome of this &s;pawn with a bucket, and after hav|ing drained off the water and dried it, I found it re&s;embled exactly the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e ne&s;ts.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;About the end of July and the beginning of Augu&s;t,</Q> it is cu&s;tomary with the people of Cochin-China to rove the i&s;lets, which &s;kirt their coa&s;t to the di&s;tance of twenty leagues, in &s;earch of the ne&s;ts of the&s;e little Swallows...</P>
<P>"The Salanganes are &s;eldom ever found, but in that immen&s;e Archipelago which encircles the ea&s;tern extremity of A&s;ia....All that Archipelago, where the i&s;lets may be &s;aid al|mo&s;t to touch each other, is extremely favour|able to the breeding of fi&s;h; their &s;pawn is very abundant; the water is there warmer than in the ocean."</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved &s;everal of the&s;e ne&s;ts; they re&s;embled the half of an oblong hollow ellip&s;oid, made by cutting it at right angles through the middle of the larger axis; and the plane of this &s;ection had &s;tuck to the rock: they con&s;i&s;ted of a yellowi&s;h white &s;ub&s;tance, &s;emi-tran&s;parent; compo&s;ed externally of exceeding thin and nearly concentric layers; the in&s;ide was formed of ir|regular net-work, the me&s;hes very unequal,

and placed one above another, the threads being drawn from the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with the outer layers, and much interwoven.</P>
<P>In the ne&s;ts which were entire, no feather could be perceived; but on cutting carefully into their &s;ub&s;tance, we found &s;ome entangled, which dimini&s;hed the tran&s;parency of the part. Sometimes, though much more rarely, we di&s;|covered fragments of egg-&s;hells; and almo&s;t all of them had ve&s;tiges of the birds' excre|ments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;t of the&s;e ob&s;ervations were fir&s;t made by Daubenton the younger, who communicated them to me with &s;everal ne&s;ts of Sa|langanes, where I ob&s;erved the &s;ame things.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I held in my mouth, a whole hour, a &s;cale de|tached from one of the&s;e ne&s;ts; it had at fir&s;t a &s;light &s;aline flavour, afterwards it was in&s;ipid as pa&s;te; it did not di&s;&s;olve, but &s;oftened and &s;welled. M.

If the <HI>Salanganes</HI> feed on the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with which they build their ne&s;t, and which is &s;o plentiful in tho&s;e &s;eas, and if it has the prolific property, which the Chine&s;e a&s;cribe to it, no wonder that the &s;pe|cies is very numerous.

Kircher had a&s;&s;erted that the&s;e birds appear on the coa&s;t only in the breeding &s;ea&s;on, and that it is uncertain where they live during the re&s;t of the year; but M.

<P>THIS bird is u&s;ually called the Corn Swallow in the I&s;le of France; it haunts the wheat fields, the glades of the woods, and prefers the uplands; it frequently &s;its on trees and on &s;tones; it follows the herds, or rather the in|&s;ects which infe&s;t them: it is al&s;o &s;een, from time to time, flying in large troops behind the ve&s;&s;els lying in the roads, and con&s;tantly in the pur&s;uit of winged in&s;ects; its cry is much like that of the common Swallow.</P>
<P>The Vi&s;count de Querhoent ob&s;erved that the Wheat Swallows circled frequently in the evening near a cut which had been made in a mountain; and he thence conjectures that, like our Sand-martins and Swifts, they pa&s;s the night in holes under ground, or in crevices of the rocks. They, no doubt, breed in the &s;ame re|treats; which may be the rea&s;on that their ne&s;ts are unknown in the I&s;le of France. The Vi&s;|count de Querhoent could procure no account of their incubation but from an old per&s;on of the I&s;le of Bourbon, and born in the country, who told him that they &s;at in September and Octo|ber,
<PB N="579" REF="616">
that he had caught many on their ne&s;ts in caverns and the holes of rocks, &amp;c. that the&s;e are compo&s;ed of &s;traw and a few feathers, and that he never &s;aw more than two eggs, which were gray and dotted with brown.</P>
<P>This Swallow is as large as our Swift; the upper &s;urface of its body blacki&s;h brown; the under &s;urface gray, &s;prinkled with long brown &s;pots; the tail &s;quare; the bill and the legs black.</P>

<P>COMMERSON brought this new &s;pecies from the I&s;le of France; it is &s;carce, though there are abundance of in&s;ects in that i&s;land; it is even lean, and its fle&s;h unpalatable; it lives indifferently in the town or the country, but al|ways near &s;prings; it is never ob&s;erved to &s;it; it flies with great celerity; it is as large as a tit|mou&s;e, and weighs two gros and a half.
