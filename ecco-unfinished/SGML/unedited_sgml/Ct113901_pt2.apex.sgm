<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALL di&s;ea&s;es originate in the exuberance, deficiency, or re|trograde action, of the faculties of the &s;en&s;orium, as their proximate cau&s;e; and con&s;i&s;t in the di&s;ordered motions of the fibres of the body, as the proximate effect of the exertions of tho&s;e di&s;ordered faculties.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;orium po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es four di&s;tinct powers, or faculties, which are occa&s;ionally exerted, and produce all the motions of the fibrous parts of the body; the&s;e are the faculties of producing fibrous motions in con&s;equence of irritation which is excited by external bodies; in con&s;equence of &s;en&s;ation which is excited by plea&s;ure or pain; in con&s;equence of vo|lition which is excited by de&s;ire or aver&s;ion; and in con&s;e|quence of a&s;&s;ociation which is excited by other fibrous mo|tions. We are hence &s;upplied with four natural cla&s;&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es derived from their proximate cau&s;es; which we &s;hall term tho&s;e of irritation, tho&s;e of &s;en&s;ation, tho&s;e of volition, and tho&s;e of a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>In the &s;ub&s;equent cla&s;&s;ification of di&s;ea&s;es I have not ad|hered to the methods of any of tho&s;e, who have preceded
<PB N="vi" REF="40">
me; the principal of whom are the great names of Sauvages and Cullen; but have neverthele&s;s availed my&s;elf, as much as I could, of their definitions and di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ential characteri&s;tic of a di&s;ea&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in its prox|imate cau&s;e, as is well ob&s;erved by Doctor Cullen, in his No|&s;ologia Methodica, T. ii. Prolegom. p. xxix. Similitudo qui|dem morborum in &s;imilitudine cau&s;ae eorum proximae, qua|li&s;cunque &s;it, rever&acirc; con&s;i&s;tit. I have taken the proximate cau&s;e for the cla&s;&s;ic character. The characters of the orders are taken from the exce&s;s, or deficiency, or retrograde ac|tion, or other properties of the proximate cau&s;e. The genus is generally derived from the proximate effect. And the &s;pecies generally from the locality of the di&s;ea&s;e in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Many &s;pecies in this &s;y&s;tem are termed genera in the &s;y&s;tems of other writers; and the &s;pecies of tho&s;e writers are in con&s;equence here termed varieties. Thus in Dr. Cullen's No&s;ologia the variola or &s;mall-pox is termed a genus, and the di&s;tinct and confluent kinds are termed &s;pecies. But as the infection from the di&s;tinct kind frequently produces the con|fluent kind, and that of the confluent kind frequently pro|duces the di&s;tinct; it would &s;eem more analogous to bota|nical arrangement, which the&s;e no&s;ologi&s;ts profe&s;s to imitate, to call the di&s;tinct and confluent &s;mall-pox varieties than &s;pecies. Becau&s;e the &s;pecies of plants in botanical &s;y&s;tems propagate others &s;imilar to them&s;elves; which does not uniformly occur in &s;uch vegetable productions as are termed varieties.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="50">
In &s;ome other genera of no&s;ologi&s;ts the &s;pecies have no analogy to each other, either in re&s;pect to their proximate cau&s;e, or to their proximate effect, though they may be &s;omewhat &s;imilar in le&s;s e&s;&s;ential properties; thus the thin and &s;aline di&s;charge from the no&s;trils on going into the cold air of a fro&s;ty morning, which is owing to the deficient ac|tion of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the no&s;trils, is one &s;pecies; and the vi&s;cid mucus di&s;charged from the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ame membrane, when inflamed, is another &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus, Catarrhus. Which bear no analogy either in re&s;pect to their immediate cau&s;e or to their imme|diate effect.</P>
<P>The u&s;es of the method here offered to the public of cla&s;&s;|ing di&s;ea&s;es according to their proximate cau&s;es are, fir&s;t, more di&s;tinctly to under&s;tand their nature by comparing their e&s;&s;ential properties. Secondly, to facilitate the know|ledge of the methods of cure; &s;ince in natural cla&s;&s;ification of di&s;ea&s;es the &s;pecies of each genus, and indeed the genera of each order, a few perhaps excepted, require the &s;ame general medical treatment. And la&s;tly, to di&s;cover the na|ture and the name of any di&s;ea&s;e previou&s;ly unknown to the phy&s;ician; which I am per&s;uaded will be more readily and more certainly done by this natural &s;y&s;tem, than by the arti|ficial cla&s;&s;ifications already publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The common names of di&s;ea&s;es are not well adapted to any kind of cla&s;&s;ification, and lea&s;t of all to this from their prox|imate cau&s;es. Some of their names in common language are taken from the remote cau&s;e, as worms, &s;tone of the blad|der; others from the remote effect, as diarrhoea, &s;alivation,
<PB N="viii" REF="60">
hydrocephalus; others from &s;ome accidental &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e, as tooth-ach, head-ach, heart-burn; in which the pain is only a concomitant circum&s;tance of the exce&s;s or de|ficiency of fibrous actions, and not the cau&s;e of them. Others again are taken from the deformity occa&s;ioned in con&s;equence of the unnatural fibrous motions, which con|&s;titute di&s;ea&s;es, as tumours, eruptions, extenuations; all the&s;e therefore improperly give names to di&s;ea&s;es; and &s;ome dif|ficulty is thus occa&s;ioned to the reader in endeavouring to di&s;|cover to what cla&s;s &s;uch di&s;orders belong.</P>
<P>Another difficulty attending the names of di&s;ea&s;es is, that one name frequently includes more than one di&s;ea&s;e, either exi&s;ting at the &s;ame time or in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Thus the pain of the bowels from worms is cau&s;ed by the increa&s;ed ac|tion of the membrane from the &s;timulus of tho&s;e animals; but the convul&s;ions, which &s;ometimes &s;ucceed the&s;e pains in children, are cau&s;ed by the con&s;equent volition, and belong to another cla&s;s.</P>
<P>To di&s;cover under what cla&s;s any di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould be ar|ranged, we mu&s;t fir&s;t inve&s;tigate the proximate cau&s;e; thus the pain of the tooth-ach is not the cau&s;e of any di&s;ea&s;ed motions, but the effect; the tooth-ach therefore does not be|long to the cla&s;s of Sen&s;ation. As the pain is cau&s;ed by in|crea&s;ed or decrea&s;ed action of the membranes of the tooth, and the&s;e actions are owing to the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of irritation, the di&s;ea&s;e is to be placed in the cla&s;s of irrita|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="70">
To di&s;cover the order it mu&s;t be inquired, whether the pain be owing to increa&s;ed or defective motion of the pained membrane; which is known by the concomitant heat or coldne&s;s of the part. In tooth-ach without inflammation there is generally a coldne&s;s attends the cheek in its vicinity; as may be perceived by the hand of the patient him&s;elf, com|pared with the oppo&s;ite cheek. Hence odontalgia is found to belong to the order of decrea&s;ed irritation. The genus and &s;pecies mu&s;t be found by in&s;pecting the &s;ynop&s;is of the &s;econd order of the cla&s;s of Irritation. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 4. 12.</P>
<P>This may be further elucidated by con&s;idering the natural operation of parturition; the pain is occa&s;ioned by the in|crea&s;ed action or di&s;tention of the ve&s;&s;els of the uterus, in con&s;equence of the &s;timulus of the fetus; and is therefore cau&s;ed by increa&s;ed irritation; but the action of the abdomi|nal mu&s;cles in its exclu&s;ion are cau&s;ed by the pain, and be|long to the cla&s;s of increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ation. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 12. Hence the difficulty of determining, under what cla&s;s of di&s;|ea&s;es parturition &s;hould be arranged, con&s;i&s;ts in there being two kinds of di&s;ea&s;ed actions comprehended under one word; which have each their different proximate cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In Sect. XXXIX. 8. 4. and in Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 1. we have en|deavoured to give names to four links of animal cau&s;ation, which conveniently apply to the cla&s;&s;ification of di&s;ea&s;es; thus in common nictitation, or winking with the eyes with|out our attention to it, the increa&s;ed irritation is the proxi|mate cau&s;e; the &s;timulus of the air on the dry cornea is the remote cau&s;e; the clo&s;ing of the eyelid is the proximate ef|fect; and the diffu&s;ion of tears over the eye ball is the remote
<PB N="x" REF="80">
effect. In &s;ome ca&s;es two more links of cau&s;ation may be introduced; one of them may be termed the pre-remote cau&s;e; as the warmth or motion of the atmo&s;phere, which cau&s;es greater exhalation from the cornea. And the other the po&s;t-remote effect; as the renewed pellucidity of the cor|nea; and thus fix links of cau&s;ation may be expre&s;&s;ed in words.</P>
<P>But if amid the&s;e remote links of animal cau&s;ation any of the four powers or faculties of the &s;en&s;orium be introduced, the rea&s;oning is not ju&s;t according to the method here pro|po&s;ed; for the&s;e powers of the &s;en&s;orium are always the proxi|mate cau&s;es of the contractions of animal fibres; and there|fore in true language cannot be termed their remote cau&s;es. From this criterion it may always be determined, whether more di&s;ea&s;es than one are comprehended under one name; a circum&s;tance which has much impeded the inve&s;tigation of the cau&s;es, and cures of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus the term fever, is generally given to a collection of morbid &s;ymptoms; which are indeed &s;o many di&s;tinct di&s;ea&s;es, that &s;ometimes appear together, and &s;ometimes &s;eparately; hence it has no determinate meaning, except it &s;ignifies &s;imply a quick pul&s;e, which continues for &s;ome hours; in which &s;en&s;e it is here u&s;ed.</P>
<P>In naming di&s;ea&s;es I have endeavoured to avoid the affec|tation of making new compound Greek words, where others equally expre&s;&s;ive could be procured: as a &s;hort periphra&s;is is ea&s;ier to be under&s;tood, and le&s;s burthen&s;ome to the memory.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="90">
In the Methodus Medendi, which is marked by M. M. at the end of many of the &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;es, the words incitantia, &s;orbentia, torpentia, &amp;c. refer to the &s;ub&s;equent articles of the Materia Medica, explaining the operations of medicines.</P>
<P>The remote cau&s;es of many di&s;ea&s;es, their periods, and many circum&s;tances concerning them, are treated of in the preced|ing volume; the de&s;criptions of many of them, which I have omitted for the &s;ake of brevity$ may be &s;een in the No&s;ologia Methodica of Sauvages, and in the Synop&s;is No&s;ologiae of Dr. Cullen, and in the authors to which they refer.</P>
<P>In this arduous undertaking the author &s;olicits the candour of the critical reader; as he cannot but fore&s;ee, that many er|rors will be di&s;covered, many additional &s;pecies will require to be in&s;erted; and others to be tran&s;planted, or era&s;ed. If he could expend another forty years in the practice of medicine, he makes no doubt, but that he could bring this work nearer perfection, and thence render it more worthy the attention of philo&s;ophers.&mdash;As it is, he is induced to hope, that &s;ome ad|vantages will be derived from it to the &s;cience of medicine, and con&s;equent utility to the public, and leaves the completion of his plan to the indu&s;try of future generations.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">With increa&s;ed Actions of the Sanguiferous Sy&s;tem.</HEAD>
<P>THE irritability of the whole, or of part, of our &s;y&s;tem is per|petually changing; the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of irritability and of inirritability are believed to depend on the accumulation or exhau&s;tion of the &s;en|&s;orial power, as their proximate cau&s;e; and on the difference of the pre&s;ent &s;timulus, and of that which we had previou&s;ly been accu&s;|tomed to, as their remote cau&s;e. Thus a &s;maller degree of heat pro|duces pain and inflammation in our hands, after they have been for a time immer&s;ed in &s;now; which is owing to the accumulation of &s;en|&s;orial power in the moving fibres of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els during their previous quie&s;cence, when they were benumbed with cold. And we feel our&s;elves cold in the u&s;ual temperature of the atmo&s;phere on coming out of a warm room; which is owing to the exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power in the moving fibres of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin by their previous increa&s;ed activity, into which they were excited by unu&s;ual heat.</P>
<P>Hence the cold fits of fever are the occa&s;ion of the &s;ucceeding hot ones; and the hot fits contribute to occa&s;ion in their turn the &s;ucceed|ing cold ones. And though the increa&s;e of &s;timulus, as of heat, ex|erci&s;e, or di&s;tention, will produce an increa&s;ed action of the &s;timulated fibres; in the &s;ame manner as it is produced by the increa&s;ed irritability
<PB N="14" REF="230">
which was occa&s;ioned by a previous defect of &s;timulus; yet as the exce&s;&s;es of irritation from the &s;timulus of external things are more ea&s;ily avoided than the deficiencies of it; the di&s;ea&s;es of this country, except tho&s;e which are the con&s;equences of drunkenne&s;s, or of im|moderate exerci&s;e, more frequently begin with torpor than with or|ga&s;m; that is, with inactivity of &s;ome parts, or of the whole of the &s;y&s;tem, and con&s;equent coldne&s;s, than with increa&s;ed activity, and con&s;equent heat.</P>
<P>If the hot fit be the con&s;equence of the cold one, it may be a&s;ked if they are proportionate to each other: it is probable that they are, where no part is de&s;troyed by the cold fit, as in mortification or death. But we have no mea&s;ure to di&s;tingui&s;h this, except the time of their duration; whereas the extent of the torpor over a greater or le&s;s part of the &s;y&s;tem, which occa&s;ion$ the cold fit; or of the exertion which occa&s;ions the hot one; as well as the degree of &s;uch torpor or exer|tion, are perhaps more material than the time of their duration. Be|&s;ides this &s;ome mu&s;cles are le&s;s liable to accumulate &s;en&s;orial power during their torpor, than others, as the locomotive mu&s;cles compared with the capillary arteries; on all which accounts a long cold fit may often be followed by a &s;hort hot one.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>SPECIES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Febris irritativa.</HI> Irritative fever. This is the &s;ynocha of &s;ome writers, it is attended with &s;trong pul&s;e without inflammation; and in this circum&s;tance differs from the febris inirritativa of Cla&s;s l. 2. 1. 1. which is attended with weak pul&s;e without inflammation. The in|crea&s;ed frequency of the pul&s;ation of the heart and arteries con&s;titutes fever; during the cold fit the&s;e pul&s;ations are always weak, as the energy of action is then decrea&s;ed throughout the whole &s;y&s;tem; and therefore the general arterial &s;trength cannot be determined by the
<PB N="15" REF="240">
touch, till the cold part of the paroxy&s;m cea&s;es. This determination is &s;ometimes attended with difficulty; as &s;trong and weak are only comparative degrees of the greater or le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance of the pul&s;ation of the artery to the compre&s;&s;ion of the finger. But the greater or le&s;s frequency of the pul&s;ations affords a collateral evidence in tho&s;e ca&s;es, where the degree of &s;trength is not very di&s;tingui&s;hable, which may a&s;&s;i&s;t our judgment concerning it. Since a moderately &s;trong pul&s;e, when the patient is in a recumbent po&s;ture, and not hurried in mind, &s;eldom exceeds 120 &s;trokes in a minute; whereas a weak one often exceeds 130 in a recumbent po&s;ture, and 150 in an erect one, in tho&s;e fevers, which are termed nervous or putrid. See Sect. XII. 1. 4.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ed frequency of the pul&s;ation of the heart and arteries, as it is occa&s;ioned either by exce&s;s or defect of &s;timulus, or of &s;en&s;orial power, exi&s;ts both in the cold and hot fits of fever; but when the cold fit cea&s;es, and the pul&s;e becomes &s;trong and full as well as quick, in con&s;equence of the increa&s;ed irritability of the heart and arteries, it con&s;titutes the irritative fever, or &s;ynocha. It is attended with con|&s;iderable heat during the paroxy&s;m, and generally terminates in a quar|ter of a lunation, without any di&s;turbance of the faculties of the mind. See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 8.</P>
<P>M. M. Vene&s;ection. Emetics. Cathartics. Cool the patient in the hot fit, and warm him in the cold one. Re&s;t. Torpentia.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ebrietas.</HI> Drunkenne&s;s. By the &s;timulus of wine or opium the whole arterial &s;y&s;tem, as well as every other part of the moving &s;y&s;tem, is excited into increa&s;ed action. All the &s;ecretions, and with them the production of &s;e$&s;orial power it&s;elf in the brain, &s;eem to be for a time increa&s;ed, with an additional quantity of heat, and of plea|&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation. See Sect. XXI. on this &s;ubject. This explains, why at the commencement of the warm paroxy&s;m of &s;ome fevers the patient is in greater &s;pirits, or vivacity; becau&s;e, as in drunkenne&s;s, the irritative motions are all increa&s;ed, and a greater production of &s;en&s;ation
<PB N="16" REF="250">
is the con&s;equence, which when in a certain degree, is plea&s;ure|able, as in the diurnal fever of weak people. Sect. XXXVI. 3. 1.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Haemorrhagia arterio&s;a.</HI> Arterial haemorrhage. Bleeding with a quick, &s;trong, and full pul&s;e. The haemorrhages from the lungs, and from the no&s;e, are the mo&s;t frequent of the&s;e; but it &s;ometimes happens, that a &s;mall artery but half divided, or the puncture of a leech, will continue to bleed pertinaciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>M. M. Vene&s;ection. Cathartic with calomel. Divide the wound|ed artery. Bind &s;ponge on the puncture. If coffee or charcoal in|ternally? If air with le&s;s oxygen?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Haemoptoe arterio&s;a.</HI> Spitting of arterial blood. Blood &s;pit up from the lungs is florid, becau&s;e it has ju&s;t been expo&s;ed to the influ|ence of the air in its pa&s;&s;age through the extremities of the pulmonary artery; it is frothy, from the admixture of air with it in the bronchia. The patients frequently vomit at the &s;ame time from the di&s;agree|able titillation of blood about the fauces; and are thence liable to be|lieve, that the blood is rejected from the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>Sometimes an haemoptoe for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days returns in gouty per&s;ons without danger, and &s;eems to &s;upply the place of the gouty paroxy&s;ms. Is not the liver always di&s;ea&s;ed previous to the haemoptoe, as in &s;everal other haemorrhages? See Cla&s;s l. 2. 1. 9.</P>
<P>M. M. Vene&s;ection, a purge, a bli&s;ter, diluents, torpentia; and afterwards &s;orbentia, as the bark, the acid of vitriol, and opium. An emetic is &s;aid to &s;top a pulmonary haemorrhage, which it may effect, as &s;ickne&s;s decrea&s;es the circulation, as is very evident in the great &s;ickne&s;s &s;ometimes produced by too large a do&s;e of digitalis pur|purea.</P>
<P>Dr. Ru&s;h &s;ays, a table &s;poonful or two of common &s;alt is &s;ucce&s;sful in haemoptoe; this may be owing to its &s;timulating the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;|tems, both the lymphatic, and the venous. Should the patient re&s;pire
<PB N="17" REF="260">
air with le&s;s oxygen? or be made &s;ick by whirling round in a chair &s;u&s;pended by a rope? One immer&s;ion in cold water, or a &s;udden &s;prinkling all over with cold water, would probably &s;top a pulmonary haemorrhage. See Sect. XXVII. 1.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Haemorrhagia narium. Epi&s;taxis.</HI> Bleeding at the no&s;e in el|derly &s;ubjects mo&s;t frequently attends tho&s;e, who&s;e livers are enlarged or inflamed by the too frequent u&s;e of fermented liquors.</P>
<P>In boys it occurs perhaps &s;imply from redundancy of blood; and in young girls &s;ometimes precedes the approach of the catamenia; and then it &s;hews a di&s;po&s;ition contrary to chloro&s;is; which ari&s;es from a deficiency of red blood.</P>
<P>M. M. It is &s;topped by plunging the head into cold water, with powdered &s;alt ha&s;tily di&s;&s;olved in it; or &s;ometimes by lint &s;trewed over with wheat flour put up the no&s;trils; or by a &s;olution of &s;teel in brandy applied to the ve&s;&s;el by means of lint. The cure in other re|&s;pects as in haemoptoe; when the bleeding recurs at certain periods, after vene&s;ection, and evacuation by calomel, and a bli&s;ter, the bark and &s;teel mu&s;t be given, as in intermittent fevers. See Section XXVII. 1.</P>

<P>THESE are always attended with increa&s;e of partial or of general heat; for the &s;ecreted fluids are not &s;imply &s;eparated from the blood, but are new combinations; as they did not previou&s;ly exi&s;t as &s;uch in the blood ve&s;&s;els. But all new combinations give out heat chemically; hence the origin of animal heat, which is always increa&s;ed in pro|portion to the &s;ecretion of the part affected, or to the general quantity of the &s;ecretions. Neverthele&s;s there is rea&s;on to believe, that as we have a &s;en&s;e purpo&s;ely to di&s;tingui&s;h the pre&s;ence of greater or le&s;s quantities of heat, as mentioned in Sect. XIV. 6. &s;o we may have certain minute glands for the &s;ecretion of this fluid, as the brain is believed to &s;ecrete the &s;en&s;orial power, which would more ea&s;ily ac|count for the in&s;tantaneous production of the blu&s;h of &s;hame, and of anger.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Calor febrilis.</HI> The heat in fevers ari&s;es from the increa&s;e of &s;ome &s;ecretion, either of the natural fluids, as in irritative fevers; or of new fluids, as in infectious fevers; or of new ve&s;&s;els, as in inflam|matory fevers. The pain of heat is a con&s;equence of the increa&s;ed exten&s;ion or contraction of the fibres expo&s;ed to &s;o great a &s;timulus. See CLASS l. 1. 5. 6.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="19" REF="280">
2. <HI>Rubor febrilis.</HI> Febrile redne&s;s. When the cold fit of fever terminates, and the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries become &s;trong as well as quick from the increa&s;e of their irritability after their late quie&s;cence, the blood is impelled forwards into the fine extremities of the arteries, and the ana&s;tomozing capillaries, quicker than the extre|mities of the veins can ab&s;orb and return it to the heart. Hence the pul&s;e at the wri&s;t becomes full, as well as quick and &s;trong, and the &s;kin glows with arterial blood, and the veins become empty and le&s;s vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>In elderly people the force of the heart and arteries becomes le&s;s, while the ab&s;orbent power of the veins remains the &s;ame; whence the capillary ve&s;&s;els part with the blood, as &s;oon as it is received, and the &s;kin in con&s;equence becomes paler; it is al&s;o probable, that in more advanced life &s;ome of the finer branches of the arteries coale&s;ce, and become impervious, and thus add to the opacity of the &s;kin.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sudor calidus.</HI> Warm &s;weat may be divided into four varieties, according to their remote cau&s;es. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the per&s;pirable matter is &s;e|creted in as great quantity during the hot fit of fever, as towards the end of it, when the &s;weat is &s;een upon the &s;kin. But during the hot fit the cutaneous ab&s;orbents act al&s;o with increa&s;ed energy, and the exhalation is likewi&s;e increa&s;ed by the greater heat of the &s;kin; and hence it does not appear in drops on the &s;urface, but is in part reab|&s;orbed, and in part di&s;&s;ipated in the atmo&s;phere. But as the mouths of the cutaneous ab&s;orbents are expo&s;ed to the cool air or bedclothes; whil&s;t tho&s;e of the capillary glands, which &s;ecrete the per&s;pirable matter, are expo&s;ed to the warmth of the circulating blood; the former, as &s;oon as the fever-fit begins to decline, lo&s;e their increa&s;ed action fir&s;t; and hence the ab&s;orption of the &s;weat is dimini&s;hed, whil&s;t the increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of it continues for &s;ome hours afterwards, which occa&s;ions it to &s;tand in drops upon the &s;kin.</P>
<P>As the &s;kin becomes cooler, the evaporation of the per&s;pirable matter
<PB N="20" REF="290">
becomes l$&s;s, as well as the ab&s;orption of it. And hence the di&s;|&s;ipation of aqueous fluid from the body, and the con&s;equent thir&s;t, are perhaps greater during the hot fit, than during the &s;ub&s;equent &s;weat. For the &s;weats do not occur, according to Dr. Alexander's experiments, till the &s;kin is cooled from 112 to 108 degrees of heat; that is, till the paroxy&s;m begins to decline. From this it appears, that the &s;weats are not critical to the hot fit, any more than the hot fit can be called critical to the cold one; but &s;imply, that they are the natural con&s;equence of the decline of the hot fit, commencing with the decrea&s;ed action of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, and the decrea&s;ed evaporation from the &s;kin. And from hence it may be concluded, that a fever-fit is not in general an effort of nature to re&s;tore health, as Sydenham con&s;idered it, but a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the previ|ous torpor; and that the cau&s;es of fevers would be le&s;s detrimental, if the fever it&s;elf could be prevented from exi&s;ting; as appears in the cool treatment of the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be noted that the profu&s;e &s;weats on the &s;kin are more fre|quent at the decline of fever-fits than the copious urine, or loo&s;e &s;tools, which are mentioned below; as the cutaneous ab&s;orbents, being expo&s;ed to the cool air, lo&s;e their increa&s;ed action &s;ooner than the urinary or inte&s;tinal ab&s;orbents; which open into the warm cavi|ties of the bladder and inte&s;tines; but which are neverthele&s;s often affected by their &s;ympathy with the cutaneous ab&s;orbents. Hence few fevers terminate without a moi&s;ture of the &s;kin; whence aro&s;e the fatal practice of forcing &s;weats by the external warmth of air or bedclothes in fevers; for external warmth increa&s;es the action of the cutaneous capillaries more than that of the other &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els; becau&s;e the latter are habituated to 98 degrees of heat, the internal warmth of the body; whereas the cutaneous capillaries being nearer the &s;urface are habitually kept cooler by the contact of the external air. Sweats thus produced by heat in confined rooms are &s;till more detrimental; as the air becomes then not only deprived of a part of
<PB N="21" REF="300">
its oxygene by frequent re&s;piration, but is loaded with animal effluvia as well as with moi&s;ture, till it can receive no more; and in con&s;e|quence, while the cutaneous &s;ecretion &s;tands upon the &s;kin in drops for want of exhalation, the lungs are expo&s;ed to an in&s;alubrious at|mo&s;phere.</P>
<P>I do not deny, that &s;weating may be &s;o managed as to be &s;ervice|able in preventing the return of the cold paroxy&s;m of fevers; like the warm bath, or any other permanent &s;timulus, as wine, or opium, or the bark. For this purpo&s;e it &s;hould be continued till pa&s;t the time of the expected cold fit, &s;upported by moderate do&s;es of wine-whey, with &s;pirit of hart&s;horn, and moderate degrees of warmth. Its &s;alu|tary effect, when thus managed, was probably one cau&s;e of its having been &s;o much attended to; and the fetid &s;mell, which when profu&s;e is liable to accompany it, gave occa&s;ion to the belief, that the &s;up|po&s;ed material cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e was thus eliminated from the cir|culation.</P>
<P>When too great external heat is applied, the &s;y&s;tem is weakened by exce&s;s of action, and the torpor which cau&s;es the cold paroxy&s;m recurs &s;ooner and more violently. For though &s;ome &s;timuli, as of opium and alcohol, at the &s;ame time that they exhau&s;t the &s;en&s;orial power by promoting increa&s;e of fibrous action, may al&s;o increa&s;e the pro|duction or &s;ecretion of it in the brain, yet experience teaches us, that the exhau&s;tion far out-balances the increa&s;ed production, as is evinced by the general debility, which &s;ucceeds intoxication.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the fetor attending copious continued &s;weats, it is owing to the animalized part of this fluid being kept in that degree of warmth, which mo&s;t favours putrefaction, and not &s;uffered to ex|hale into the atmo&s;phere. Broth, or other animal mucus, kept in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, would in the &s;ame time acquire a putrid &s;mell; yet has this error frequently produced miliary eruptions, and increa&s;ed every kind of inflammatory or &s;en&s;itive fever.</P>
<P>The $a&s;e, which the patient experiences during &s;weating, if it be
<PB N="22" REF="310">
not produced by much external heat, is &s;imilar to that of the warm bath; which by its &s;timulus applied to the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els, which are generally cooler than the internal parts of the &s;y&s;tem, excites them into greater action; and plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation is the con&s;equence of the&s;e increa&s;ed actions of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin. From con&s;idering all the&s;e circum&s;tances, it appears that it is not the evacuation by &s;weats, but the continued &s;timulus, which cau&s;es and &s;upports tho&s;e &s;weats, which is &s;erviceable in preventing the returns of fever-fits. And that &s;weats too long continued, or induced by too great &s;timulus of warmth, clothes, or medicines, greatly injure the patient by in|crea&s;ing inflammation, or by exhau&s;ting the &s;en&s;orial power. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 14.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The &s;weats produced by exerci&s;e or labour are of the warm kind; as they originate from the increa&s;ed action of the capil|laries of the &s;kin, owing to their being more powerfully &s;timulated by the greater velocity of the blood, and by a greater quantity of it pa&s;&s;ing through them in a given time. For the blood during violent exerci&s;e is carried forwards by the action of the mu&s;cles fa&s;ter in the arteries, than it can be taken up by the veins; as appears by the redne&s;s of the &s;kin. And from the con&s;equent &s;weats, it is evinced, that the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin during exerci&s;e pour out the per|&s;pirable matter fa&s;ter, than the mouths of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els can drink it up. Which mouths are not expo&s;ed to the increa&s;ed mu&s;|cular action, or to the &s;timulus of the increa&s;ed velocity and quantity of the blood, but to the cool air.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> the increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of per&s;pirable matter occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulus of external heat belongs likewi&s;e to this place; as it is cau&s;ed by the increa&s;ed motions of the capillary ve&s;&s;els; which thus &s;eparate from the blood more per&s;pirable matter, than the mouths of their corre&s;pondent ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els can take up; though the&s;e al&s;o are &s;timulated by external heat into more energetic action. If the air be &s;tationary, as in a &s;mall room, or bed with clo&s;ed curtains, the
<PB N="23" REF="320">
&s;weat &s;tands in drops on the &s;kin for want of a quicker exhalation pro|portioned to the quicker &s;ecretion.</P>
<P>A <HI>fourth</HI> variety of warm per&s;piration is that occa&s;ioned by &s;timu|lating drugs, of which opium and alcohol are the mo&s;t powerful; and next to the&s;e the &s;pices, volatile alkali, and neutral &s;alts, e&s;peci|ally &s;ea &s;alt; that much of the aqueous part of the blood is di&s;&s;ipated by the u&s;e of the&s;e drugs, is evinced by the great thir&s;t, which oc|curs a few hours after the u&s;e of them. See Art. III. 2. 12. and Art. III. 2. 1.</P>
<P>We may from hence under&s;tand, that the increa&s;e of this &s;ecretion of per&s;pirable matter by artificial means, mu&s;t be followed by debi$ity and emaciation. When this is done by taking much &s;alt, or &s;alted meat, the &s;ea-&s;curvy is produced; which con&s;i&s;ts in the inirritability of the bibulous terminations of the veins ari&s;ing from the capillaries; &s;ee Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 14. The &s;crophula, or inirritability of the lympha|tic glands, &s;eems al&s;o to be occa&s;ionally induced by an exce&s;s in eating &s;alt added to food of bad nouri&s;hment. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 21. If an exce&s;s of per&s;piration is induced by warm or &s;timulant clothing, as by wearing flannel in contact with the &s;kin in the &s;ummer months, a perpetual febricula is excited, both by the preventing the acce&s;s of cool air to the &s;kin, and by perpetually goading it by the numerous and hard points of the ends of the wool; which when applied to the tender &s;kins of young children, frequently produce the red gum, as it is called; and in grown people, either an ery&s;ipelas, or a miliary eruption, attended with fever. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 3. 12.</P>
<P>Shirts made of cotton or calico &s;timulate the &s;kin too much by the points of the fibres, though le&s;s than flannel; whence cotton hand|kerchiefs make the no&s;e &s;ore by frequent u&s;e. The fibres of cotton are, I &s;uppo&s;e, ten times &s;horter than tho&s;e of flax, and the number of points in con&s;equence twenty times the number; and though the manufacturers &s;inge their calicoes on a red-hot iron cylinder, yet I
<PB N="24" REF="330">
have more than once &s;een an ery&s;ipelas induced or increa&s;ed by the &s;timulus of calico, as well as of flannel.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of per&s;piration by heat either of clothes, or of fire, contributes much to emaciate the body; as is well known to jockeys, who, when they are a &s;tone or two too heavy for riding, find the quicke&s;t way to le&s;&s;en their weight is by &s;weating them&s;elves between blankets in a warm room; but this likewi&s;e is a practice by no means to be recommended, as it weakens the &s;y&s;tem by the exce&s;s of &s;o general a &s;timulus, brings on a premature old age, and &s;hortens the &s;pan of life; as may be further deduced from the quick maturity, and &s;hortne&s;s of the lives, of the inhabitants of Hindo&s;tan, and other tropical climates.</P>
<P>M. Buffon made a curious experiment to &s;hew this circum&s;tance. He took a numerous brood of the butterflies of &s;ilkworms, &s;ome hundreds of which left their eggs on the &s;ame day and hour; the&s;e he divided into two parcels; and placing one parcel in the &s;outh win|dow, and the other in the north window of his hou&s;e, he ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e in the colder &s;ituation lived many days longer than tho&s;e in the warmer one. From the&s;e ob&s;ervations it appears, that the wear|ing of flannel clothing next the &s;kin, which is now &s;o much in fa&s;hion, however u&s;eful it may be in the winter to tho&s;e, who have cold extremities, bad dige&s;tions, or habitual coughs, mu&s;t greatly debilitate them, if worn in the warm months, producing fevers, eruptions, and premature old age. See Sect. XXXVII. 5. Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 14. Art. III. 2. 1.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Urina uberior colorata.</HI> Copious coloured urine. Towards the end of fever-&s;its a large quantity of high coloured urine is voided, the kidneys continuing to act &s;trongly, after the increa&s;ed action of the ab&s;orbents of the bladder is &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed. If the ab&s;orbents continue al&s;o to act &s;trongly, the urine is higher coloured, and &s;o
<PB N="25" REF="340">
loaded as to depo&s;it, when cool, an earthy &s;ediment, erroneou&s;ly thought to be the material cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; but is &s;imply owing to the &s;ecretion of the kidnies being great from their increa&s;ed action; and the thinner parts of it being ab&s;orbed by the increa&s;ed action of the lymphatics, which are &s;pread very thick on the neck of the blad|der; for the urine, as well as perhaps all the other &s;ecreted fluids, is produced from the kidnies in a very dilute &s;tate; as appears in tho&s;e, who from the &s;timulus of a &s;tone, or other cau&s;e, evacuate their urine too frequently; which is then pale from its not having remained in the bladder long enough for the more aqueous part to have been re|ab&s;orbed. The general u&s;e of this urinary ab&s;orption to the animal oeconomy is evinced from the urinary bladders of fi&s;h, which would otherwi&s;e be unnece&s;&s;ary. High coloured urine in large quantity &s;hews only, that the &s;ecreting ve&s;&s;els of the kidnies, and the ab|&s;orbents of the bladder, have acted with greater energy. When there is much earthy &s;ediment, it &s;hews, that the ab&s;orbents have acted proportionally &s;tronger, and have con&s;equently left the urine in a le&s;s dilute &s;tate. In this urine the tran&s;parent &s;ediment or cloud is mu|cous; the opake &s;ediment is probably coagulable lymph from the blood changed by an animal or chemical proce&s;s. The floating &s;cum is oil. The angular concretions to the &s;ides of the pot, formed as the urine cools, is microco&s;mic &s;alt. Does the adhe&s;ive blue matter on the &s;ides of the gla&s;s, or the blue circle on it at the edge of the upper &s;urface of the urine, con&s;i&s;t of Pru&s;&s;ian blue?</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Diarrhoea calida.</HI> Warm diarrhoea. This &s;pecies may be di|vided into three varieties deduced from their remote cau&s;es, under the names of diarrhoea febrilis, diarrhoea crapulo&s;a, and diarrhoea infantum. The febrile diarrhoea appears at the end of fever-&s;its, and is erroneou&s;ly called critical, like the copious urine, and the &s;weats; whereas it ari&s;es from the increa&s;ed action of tho&s;e &s;ecerning organs, which pour
<PB N="26" REF="350">
their fluids into the inte&s;tinal canal (as the liver, pancreas, and mu|cous glands), continuing longer than the increa&s;ed action of the in|te&s;tinal ab&s;orbents. In this diarrhoea there is no appearance of curdled chyle in the &s;tools, as occurs in cholera. I. 3. 1. 5.</P>
<P>The <HI>diarrhoea crapulo&s;a,</HI> or diarrhoea from indige&s;tion, occurs when too great a quantity of food or liquid has been taken; which not being compleatly dige&s;ted, &s;timulates the inte&s;tines like any other extraneous acrid material; and thus produces an increa&s;e of the &s;ecre|tions into them of mucus, pancreatic juice, and bile. When the contents of the bowels are &s;till more &s;timulant, as when dra&s;tic purges, or very putre&s;cent diet, have been taken, a cholera is in|duced. See Sect. XXIX. 4.</P>
<P>The <HI>diarrhoea infantum,</HI> or diarrhoea of infants, is generally owing to too great acidity in their bowels. Milk is found curdled in the &s;tomachs of all animals, old as well as young, and even of carnivorous ones, as of hawks. (Spallanzani.) And it is the ga&s;tric juice of the calf, which is employed to curdle milk in the proce&s;s of making chee&s;e. Milk is the natural food for children, and mu&s;t curdle in their &s;tomachs previous to dige&s;tion; and as this curdling of the milk de&s;troys a part of the acid juices of the &s;tomach, there is no rea&s;on for di&s;continuing the u&s;e of it, though it is occa&s;ionally ejected in a curdled &s;tate. A child of a week old, which had been taken from the brea&s;t of its dying mother, and had by &s;ome uncommon error been &s;uffered to take no food but water-gruel, became $ick and griped in twenty-four hours, and was convul&s;ed on the &s;econd day, and died on the third! When all young quadrupeds, as well as children, have this natural food of milk prepared for them, the analogy is &s;o &s;trong in favour of its &s;alubrity, that a per&s;on &s;hould have powerful te&s;ti|mony indeed of its di&s;agreeing, before he advi&s;es the di&s;continuance of the u&s;e of it to young children in health, and much more &s;o in &s;ickne&s;s. The farmers lo&s;e many of their calves, which are brought
<PB N="27" REF="360">
up by gruel, or gruel and old milk; and among the poor children of Derby, who are thus fed, hundreds are &s;tarved into the &s;crophula, and either peri&s;h, or live in a &s;tate of wretched debility.</P>
<P>When young children are brought up without a brea&s;t, they &s;hould for the fir&s;t two months have no food but new milk; &s;ince the ad|dition of any kind of bread or flour is liable to ferment, and produce too much acidity; as appears by the con&s;equent diarrhoea with green dejections and gripes; the colour is owing to a mixture of acid with the natural quantity of bile, and the pain to its &s;timulus. And they &s;hould never be fed as they lie upon their backs, as in that po&s;ture they are nece&s;&s;itated to &s;wallow all that is put into their mouths; but when they are fed, as they are &s;itting up, or rai&s;ed up, when they have had enough, they can permit the re&s;t to run out of their mouths. This circum&s;tance is of great importance to the health of tho&s;e chil|dren, who are reared by the &s;poon, &s;ince if too much food is given them, indige&s;tion, and gripes, and diarrhoea, is the con&s;equence; and if too little, they become emaciated; and of this exact quantity their own palates judge the be&s;t.</P>
<P>M. M. In this la&s;t ca&s;e of the diarrhoea of children, the food &s;hould be new milk, which by curdling de&s;troys part of the acid, which co|agulates it. Chalk about four grains every &s;ix hours, with one drop of &s;pirit of hart&s;horn, and half a drop of laudanum. But a bli&s;ter about the &s;ize of a &s;hilling is of the greate&s;t &s;ervice by re&s;toring the power of dige&s;tion. See Article III. 2. 1. in the &s;ub&s;equent Materia Medica.</P>

This di&s;ea&s;e, which is called a cold in the head, is frequently produced by cold air acting for &s;ome time on the membranes, which line the no&s;|trils, as it pa&s;&s;es to the lungs in re&s;piration. Whence a torpor of the action of the mucous glands is fir&s;t introduced, as in I. 2. 3. 3. and an orga&s;m or increa&s;ed action &s;ucceeds in con&s;equence. Afterwards this orga&s;m and torpor are liable to alternate with each other for &s;ome time like the cold and hot fits of ague, attended with deficient or ex|uberant &s;ecretion of mucus in the no&s;trils.</P>
<P>At other times it ari&s;es from rever&s;e &s;ympathy with &s;ome exten&s;ive parts of the &s;kin, which have been expo&s;ed too long to cold, as of the head, or feet. In con&s;equence of the torpor of the&s;e cutaneous ca|pillaries tho&s;e of the mucous membrane of the no&s;trils act with greater energy by rever&s;e &s;ympathy; and thence &s;ecrete more mucus from the blood. At the &s;ame time the ab&s;orbents, acting al&s;o with greater energy by their rever&s;e &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of &s;ome di&s;tant part of the $kin, ab&s;orb the thinner parts of the mucus more ha&s;tily; whence the mucus is both thicker and in greater quantity. Other curious circum&s;tances attend this di&s;ea&s;e; the membrane becomes at times &s;o thickened by its increa&s;ed action in &s;ecreting the mucus, that the patient cannot breathe through his no&s;trils.

too &s;udden healing of the&s;e morbid effu&s;ions behind their ears. The rationale of this is to be explained from a medical fact, which I have frequently ob&s;erved; and that is, that a bli&s;ter on the back greatly &s;trengthens the power of dige&s;tion, and removes the heart-burn in adults, and green &s;tools in children. The &s;timulus of the bli&s;ter produces &s;en&s;ation in the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin; with this additional &s;en|&s;orial power the&s;e ve&s;&s;els act more &s;trongly; and with the&s;e the ve&s;|&s;els of the internal membranes of the &s;tomach and bowels act with greater energy from their direct &s;ympathy with them. Now the acrid di&s;charge behind the ears of children produces &s;en&s;ation on that part of the &s;kin, and &s;o far acts as a &s;mall bli&s;ter. When this is &s;ud|denly &s;topped, a debility of the dige&s;tive power of the &s;tomach &s;uc|ceeds from the want of this accu&s;tomed &s;timulus, with flatulency, green &s;tools, gripes, and &s;ometimes con&s;equent convul&s;ions.

The &s;alts of the urine, called microco&s;mic &s;alt, are often mi&s;taken for gravel, but are di&s;tingui&s;hable both by their angles of cry&s;tallization, their adhe&s;ion to the &s;ides or bottom of the pot, and by their not being formed till the urine cools. Whereas the particles of gravel are generally without angles, and always drop to the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, immediately as the water is voided.</P>
<P>Though the proximate cau&s;e of the formation of the calculous con|cretions of the kidneys, and of chalk-&s;tones in the gout, and of the in&s;oluble concretions of coagulable lymph, which are found on mem|branes, which have been inflamed in peripneumony, or rheumati&s;m, con&s;i&s;ts in the too great action of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of tho&s;e parts; yet the remote cau&s;e in the&s;e ca&s;es is probably owing to the inflammation
<PB N="42" REF="510">
of the membranes; which at that time are believed to &s;ecrete a material more liable to coagulate or concrete, than they would other|wi&s;e produce by increa&s;ed action alone without the production of new ve&s;&s;els, which con&s;titutes inflammation. As defined in Cla&s;s II. 1. 2.</P>
<P>The fluids &s;ecreted from the mucous membranes of animals are of various kinds and con&s;i&s;tencies. Hair, &s;ilk, &s;cales, horns, finger|nails, are owing to natural proce&s;&s;es. Gall-&s;tones, &s;tones found in the inte&s;tines of hor&s;es, &s;curf of the &s;kin in lepro&s;y, &s;tones of the kidnies and bladder, the callus from the inflamed perio&s;teum, which unites broken bones, the calcareous cement, which repairs the injured &s;hells of &s;nails, the calcareous cru&s;t on the eggs of birds, the annually renewed &s;hells of crabs, are all in&s;tances of productions from mucous membranes, afterwards indurated by ab&s;orption of their thinner parts.</P>
<P>All the&s;e concretions contain pho&s;phoric acid, mucus, and cal|careous earth in different proportions; and are probably &s;o far analo|gous in re&s;pect to their component parts as well as their mode of for|mation. Some calcareous earth has been di&s;covered after putrefaction in the coagulable lymph of animals. Fordyce's Elements of Practice. A little calcareous earth was detected by Scheel or Bergman in the calculus of the bladder with much pho&s;phoric acid, and a great quantity of pho&s;phoric acid is &s;hewn to exi&s;t in oy&s;ter-&s;hells by their becoming luminous on expo&s;ing them a while to the &s;un's light after calcination; as in the experiments of Wil&s;on. Botanic Garden, P. 1. Canto 1. l. 182, note. The exchange of which pho&s;phoric acid for carbonic acid, or fixed air, converts &s;hells into lime&s;tone, producing mountains of marble, or calcareous &s;trata.</P>
<P>Now as the hard lumps of calcareous matter, termed crabs' eyes, which are found in the &s;tomachs of tho&s;e animals previous to the an|nual renewal of their &s;hells, are redi&s;&s;olved, probably by their ga&s;tric acid, and again depo&s;ited for that purpo&s;e; may it not be concluded, that the &s;tone of the bladder might be di&s;&s;olved by the ga&s;tric juice of fi&s;h of prey, as of crabs, or pike; or of voracious young birds, as
<PB N="43" REF="520">
young rooks or hawks, or even of calves? Could not the&s;e experi|ments be tried by collecting the ga&s;tric juice by putting bits of &s;ponge down the throats of young crows, and retracting them by a &s;tring in the manner of Spallanzani? or putting pieces of calculus down the throat of a living crow, or pike, and ob&s;erving if they become dige&s;ted? and la&s;tly could not ga&s;tric juice, if it &s;hould appear to be a &s;olvent, be injected and born in the bladder without injury by means of catheters of ela&s;tic re&s;in, or caoutchouc?</P>
<P>M. M. Diluents. Cool dre&s;s. Frequent change of po&s;ture. Frequent horizontal re&s;t in the day. Bathe the loins every morning with a &s;ponge and cold water. Aerated alcaline water internally. Ab&s;tinence from all fermented or &s;pirituous liquors. Whatever in|crea&s;es per&s;piration injures the&s;e patients, as it di&s;&s;ipates the aqueous particles, which ought to dilute the urine. When the con&s;titution begins to produce gravel, it may I believe be certainly prevented by a total ab&s;tinence from fermented or &s;pirituous liquors; by drinking much aqueous fluids; as toa&s;t and water, tea, milk and water, le|monade; and la&s;tly by thin clothing, and &s;leeping on a hardi&s;h bed, that the patient may not lie too long on one &s;ide. See Cla&s;s IV. 2. 2. 2. There is rea&s;on to believe, that the daily u&s;e of opium contributes to produce gravel in the kidnies by increa&s;ing ab&s;orption, when they are inflamed; in the &s;ame manner as is done by fermented or &s;pirituous liquor. See Cla&s;s I. 3. 2. 11.</P>
<P>When the kidnies are &s;o ob&s;tructed with gravel, that no urine pa&s;&s;es into the bladder; which is known by the external appearance of the lower part of the abdomen, which, when the bladder is full, &s;eems as if contracted by a cord between the navel and the bladder; and by the ten&s;ion on the region of the bladder di&s;tingui&s;hable by the touch; or by the introduction of the catheter; the following methods of cure are frequently &s;ucce&s;sful. Vene&s;ection to &s;ix or eight ounces, ten grains of calomel, and an infu&s;ion of &s;enna with &s;alts and oil, every three hours, till &s;tools are procured. Then an emetic. After

the patient has been thus evacuated, a bli&s;ter on the loins &s;hould be u&s;ed; and from ten to twenty electric &s;hocks &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed through the kidnies, as large as can be ea&s;ily borne, once or twice a day. Along with this method the warm bath &s;hould be u&s;ed for an hour once or twice a day. After repeated evacuations a cly&s;ter, con&s;i&s;ting of two drams of turpentine di&s;&s;olved by yolk of egg, and &s;ixty drops of tincture of opium, &s;hould be u&s;ed at night, and repeated, with cathartic medicines interpo&s;ed, every night, or alternate nights. Aerated &s;olution of alcali &s;hould be taken internally, and bal&s;am of copaiva, three or four times a day. Some of the&s;e patients recover after having made no water for nine or ten days.</P>
<P>If a &s;tone &s;ticks in the ureter with ince&s;&s;ant vomiting, ten grains of calomel mu&s;t be given in &s;mall pills as above; and &s;ome hours after|wards infu&s;ion of &s;enna and &s;alts and oil, if it can be made to &s;tay on the &s;tomach. And after the purge has operated four or five times, an opiate is to be given, if the pain continues, con&s;i&s;ting of two grains of opium. If this does not &s;ucceed, ten or twenty electric &s;hocks through the kidney &s;hould be tried, and the purgative repeated, and afterwards the opiate. The patient &s;hould be frequently put into the warm bath for an hour at a time. Eighty or an hundred drops of laudanum given in a gly&s;ter, with two drams of turpentine, is to be preferred to the two grains given by the &s;tomach as above, when the pain and vomiting are very urgent.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Calculus ve&s;icae.</HI> Stone of the bladder. The nucleus, or ker|nel, of the&s;e concretions is always formed in the kidney, as above de|&s;cribed; and pa&s;&s;ing down the ureter into the bladder, is there per|petually increa&s;ed by the mucus and &s;alts &s;ecreted from the arterial &s;y&s;tem, or by the mucus of the bladder, di&s;po&s;ed in concentric &s;trata. The &s;tones found in the bowels of ho$&s;es are al&s;o formed on a nucleus, and con&s;i&s;t of concentric &s;pheres; as appears in &s;awing them through the middle. But as the&s;e are formed by the indurated mucus of the

inte&s;tines alone without the urinary &s;alts, it is probable a difference would be found on their analy&s;is.</P>
<P>As the &s;tones of the bladder are of various degrees of hardne&s;s, and probably differ from each other in the proportions at lea&s;t of their com|ponent parts; when a patient, who labours under this afflicting di&s;ea&s;e, voids any &s;mall bits of gravel; the&s;e &s;hould be kept in warm &s;olutions of cau&s;tic alcali, or of mild alcali well aerated; and if they di&s;&s;olve in the&s;e &s;olutions, it would afford greater hopes, that that which remains in the bladder, might be affected by the&s;e medicines taken by the &s;tomach, or injected into the bladder.</P>
<P>To prevent the increa&s;e of a &s;tone in the bladder much diluent drink &s;hould be taken; as half a pint of water warmed to about eighty degrees, three or four times a day: which will not only prevent the growth of it, by preventing any microco&s;mic &s;alts from being precipitated from the urine, and by keeping the mucus &s;u&s;|pended in it; but will al&s;o dimini&s;h the &s;tone already formed, by &s;oftening, and wa&s;hing away its &s;urface. To this mu&s;t be added cool dre&s;s, and cool bed-clothes, as directed above in the calculus renis.</P>
<P>When the &s;tone is pu&s;hed again&s;t or into the neck of the bladder, great pain is produced; this may &s;ometimes be relieved by the intro|duction of a bougie to pu&s;h the &s;tone back into the fundus of the bladder. Sometimes by change of po&s;ture, or by an opiate either taken into the &s;tomach, or by a cly&s;ter.</P>

An aerated alcaline water of this kind is &s;old under the name of factitious Seltzer water, by J. Schweppe, at N^o 8, King's-&s;treet, Holborn, London; which I am told is better prepared than can be ea&s;ily done in the u&s;ual gla&s;s-ve&s;&s;els, probably by employing a greater pre&s;&s;ure in wooden ones.</P>

<P N="11">11. <HI>Calculus arthriticus.</HI> Gout-&s;tones are formed on inflamed membranes, like tho&s;e of the kidnies above de&s;cribed, by the too ha&s;ty ab&s;orption of the thinner and &s;aline parts of the mucus. Simi|lar concretions have been produced in the lungs, and even in the pe|ricardium; and it is probable, that the o&s;&s;ification, as it is called, of the minute arteries, which is &s;aid to attend old age, and to precede &s;ome mortifications of the extremities, may be a proce&s;s of this kind.</P>
<P>As gout-&s;tones lie near the &s;urface, it is probable, that ether, fre|quently applied in their early &s;tate, might render them &s;o liquid as to permit their reab&s;orption; which the &s;timulus of the ether might at the &s;ame time encourage.</P>

<P>M. M. This is promoted by bandage, by the &s;orbentia externally, as powder of bark, white lead; &s;olution of &s;ugar of lead. And by the &s;orbentia internally after evacuations. See Sect. XXXIII. 3. 2.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e ulcers, which are made by the contact of external fire, the violent action of the fibres, which occa&s;ions the pain, is liable to con|tinue, after the external heat is withdrawn.

<P>The cicatrix of an ulcer generally proceeds from the edges of it; but in large ones frequently from the middle, or commences in &s;eve|ral places at the &s;ame time; which probably contributes to the un|evenne&s;s of large &s;cars.</P>

Tho&s;e blemi&s;hes of the eye are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mu&s;cae volitantes de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s I. 2. 5. 3. by their being invariably &s;een at any time, when you look for them.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Nec$itatio irritativa.</HI> Winking of the eyes is performed every minute without our attention, for the purpo&s;e of cleaning and moi&s;ten|ing the eye-ball; as further &s;poken of in Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 8. When the cornea becomes too dry, it becomes at the &s;ame time le&s;s tran&s;pa|rent; which is owing to the pores of it being then too large, &s;o that the particles of light are refracted by the edges of each pore, in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing through it; in the &s;ame manner as light is refracted by pa&s;&s;ing near the edge of a knife. When the&s;e pores are filled with water, the cornea becomes again tran&s;parent. This want of tran&s;|parency of the cornea is vi&s;ible &s;ometimes in dying people, owing to their inirritability, and con&s;equent neglect of nictitation.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of tran&s;parency by filling the pores with fluid is &s;een by &s;oaking white paper in oil; which from an opake body becomes very tran&s;parent, and accounts for a curious atmo&s;pheric phenomenon; when there exi&s;ts a dry mi&s;t in a morning &s;o as to render di&s;tant ob|jects le&s;s di&s;tinct, it is a &s;ign of a dry day; when di&s;tant objects are &s;een very di&s;tinct, it is a &s;ign of rain. See Botan. Garden, Part I. add. note xxv. The particles of air are probably larger than tho&s;e of water, as water will pa&s;s through leather and paper, which will confine air; hence when the atmo&s;phere is much deprived of moi&s;ture, the pores of the dry air are &s;o large, that the rays of light are refracted by their
<PB N="50" REF="590">
edges in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing through them. But when as much moi&s;ture is added as can be perfectly di&s;&s;olved, the air becomes tran&s;parent; and opake again, when a part of this moi&s;ture collects into &s;mall &s;pherules previous to its precipitation. This al&s;o accounts for the want of tran&s;|parency of the air, which is &s;een in tremulous motions over corn-fields on hot &s;ummer-days, or over brick-kilns, after the flame is extin|gui&s;hed, while the furnace &s;till remains hot.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Deglutitio irritativa.</HI> The deglutition of our &s;aliva is performed frequently without our attention, and is then an irritative action in con&s;equence of the &s;timulus of it in the mouth. Or perhaps &s;ome|times for the purpo&s;e of diffu&s;ing a part of it over the dry membranes of the fauces and pharinx; in the &s;ame manner as tears are diffu&s;ed over the cornea of the eye by the act of nictitation to clean or moi&s;ten it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Re&s;piratio et Tu&s;&s;is irritativ$e.</HI> In the acts of re&s;piration and of coughing there is an increa&s;ed motion of the air-cells of the lungs ow|ing to &s;ome &s;timulating cau&s;e, as de&s;cribed above in Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 8. and I. 1. 3. 4. and which are frequently performed without our attention or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and are then irritative actions; and thus differ from tho&s;e de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 2. and 5. To the&s;e increa&s;ed actions of the air-cells are &s;uperadded tho&s;e of the interco&s;tal mu&s;cles and diaphragm by irritative a&s;&s;ociation. When any unnatural &s;timulus acts &s;o violently on the organs of re&s;piration as to induce pain, the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation becomes added to that of irritation, and inflammation of the membranes of them is a general con&s;equence.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Exclu&s;io bilis.</HI> The exclu&s;ion of the bile from the gall-bladder, and its derivation into the duodenum, is an irritative action in con&s;e|quence of the &s;timulus of the aliment on the extremity of the biliary duct, which terminates in the inte&s;tine. The increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of

The generation of the&s;e worms is promoted by the too dilute &s;tate of the bile, as is evident in the fleuke-worm found in the biliary ducts and &s;ub&s;tance of the liver in &s;heep; and in water-rats, in the livers of which la&s;t animals they were lately detected in large numbers by Dr. Capelle. Tran&s;actions of the college at Philadelphia, v. i.</P>
<P>Now as the dilute &s;tate of the bile depends on the deficiency of the ab&s;orption of its thinner parts, it appears, that the tumid belly, and bloated countenance, and &s;welled upper lip, are a concomitant cir|cum&s;tance attending the general inactivity of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem; which is therefore to be e&s;teemed the remote cau&s;e of the generation of worms.</P>
<P>The &s;implicity of the &s;tructure of worms probably enables them to exi&s;t in more various temperatures of heat; and their being endued with life prevents them from being de&s;troyed by dige&s;tion in the &s;tomach, probably in the &s;ame manner as the powers of life prevent the fermentation and putrefaction of the &s;tomach it&s;elf. Hence I conclude,
<PB N="54" REF="630">
that worms are originally taken into our alimentary canal from without; as I believe &s;imilar worms of all kinds are to be found out of the body.</P>
<P>M. M. The round worm is de&s;troyed by a cathartic with four or &s;ix grains of calomel; and afterwards by giving &s;ix or eight grains of filings of iron twice a day for a fortnight. See Hepatis tumor, Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 9. As worms are liable to come away in fevers, whether of the hectic or putrid kind, could they be removed by purulent matter, or rotten egg, or putrid fle&s;h, &s;ince in tho&s;e fevers from the enfeebled action of the inte&s;tines the faeces become highly putrid?</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Taenia.</HI> Tape-worm con&s;i&s;ts of a chain of animals extending from the &s;tomach to the anus. See Sect. XXXIX. 2. 3. It frequently exi&s;ts in cats, rats, and gee&s;e, and probably in many other animals.</P>
<P>The worms of this genus po&s;&s;e&s;s a wonderful power of retaining life. Two of them, which were voided by a pointer dog in con&s;e|quence of violent purgatives, each of which were &s;everal feet in length, had boiling water poured on them in a ba&s;on; which &s;eemed not much to inconvenience them. When the water was cool, they were taken out and put into gin or whi&s;key of the &s;tronge&s;t kind, in which their life and activity continued unimpaired; and they were at length killed by adding to the &s;pirit a quantity of corro&s;ive &s;ublimate. Medic. Comment. for 1791, p. 370.</P>
<P>The tape-worm is cured by an amalgama of tin and quick&s;ilver, &s;uch as is u&s;ed on the back of looking-gla&s;&s;es; an ounce &s;hould be taken every two hours, till a pound is taken; and then a bri&s;k cathar|tic of Glauber's &s;alt two ounces, and common &s;alts one ounce, di&s;&s;olv|ed in two wine pints of water, half a pint to be taken every hour till it purges. The worm extends from the &s;tomach to the anus, and the amalgama tears it from the inte&s;tine by mechanical pre&s;&s;ure, acting upon it the whole way. Electric &s;hocks through the duodenum
<PB N="55" REF="640">
greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ts the operation. Large do&s;es of tin in powder. Iron filings in large do&s;es. The powder of fern-root &s;eems to be of no u&s;e, as recommended by M. Noufflier.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>A&s;carides.</HI> Thread-worms. The&s;e worms are &s;aid to be more frequent in &s;ome parts of this kingdom than in others, as near the fens of Lincoln&s;hire. Do they e&s;cape from the body and become flies, like the bott-worm in hor&s;es? Do they crawl from one child to ano|ther in the &s;ame bed? Are they acquired from flies or worms, which are &s;een in putrid nece&s;&s;ary hou&s;es, as the&s;e worms as well as the tape|worms, are probably acquired from without? this may account for their re-appearance a few weeks or months after they have been de&s;troy|ed; or can this happen from the eggs or parts of them remaining?</P>
<P>A&s;carides appear to be of two kinds, the common &s;mall ones like a thread; which has a very &s;harp head, as appears in the micro&s;cope; and which is &s;o tender, that the cold air &s;oon renders it motionle&s;s; and a larger kind above an inch long, and nearly as thick as a very &s;mall crow-quill, and which is very hard in re&s;pect to its texture, and very tenacious of life. One of the&s;e la&s;t was brought to me, and was immediately immer&s;ed in a &s;trong &s;olution of &s;ugar of lead, and lived in it a very long time without apparent inconvenience.</P>
<P>M. M. A&s;carides are &s;aid to be weakened by twenty grains of cin|nabar and five of rhubarb taken every night, but not to be cured by this proce&s;s. As the&s;e worms are found only in the rectum, variety of cly&s;ters have been recommended. I was informed of a ca&s;e, where &s;olutions of mercurial ointment were u&s;ed as a cly&s;ter every night for a month without &s;ucce&s;s. Cly&s;ters of Harrow gate water are recommend|ed, either of the natural, or of the factitious, as de&s;cribed below, which might have a greater proportion of liver of &s;ulphur in it. As the cold air &s;oon de&s;troys them, after they are voided, could cly&s;ters of iced water be u&s;ed with advantage? or of &s;pirit of wine and water? or of ether and water? Might not a piece of candle, about an inch
<PB N="56" REF="650">
long, or two &s;uch pieces, &s;meared with mercurial ointment, and in|troduced into the anus at night, or twice a day, be effectual by com|pre&s;&s;ing their nidus, as well as by the poi&s;on of the mercury.</P>
<P>The cly&s;ters &s;hould be large in quantity, that they may pa&s;s high in the rectum, as two drams of tobacco boiled a minute in a pint of water. Or perhaps what might be &s;till more efficacious and le&s;s in|convenient, the &s;moke of tobacco injected by a proper apparatus every night, or alternate nights, for &s;ix or eight weeks. This was long &s;ince recommended, I think by Mr. Turner of Liverpool; and the rea&s;on it has not &s;ucceeded, I believe to have been owing to the imperfections of the joints of the common apparatus for injecting the &s;moke of to|bacco, &s;o that it did not pa&s;s into the inte&s;tine, though it was &s;up|po&s;ed to do &s;o, as I once ob&s;erved. The &s;moke &s;hould be received from the apparatus into a large bladder; and it may then be certainly injected like the common cly&s;ter with &s;ufficient force; otherwi&s;e oiled leathers &s;hould be nicely put round the joints of the machine; and a wet cloth round the injecting pipe to prevent the return of the &s;moke by the &s;ides of it. Cly&s;ters of carbonated hydrogen gas, or of other factitious airs, might be tried.</P>
<P>Harrow gate water taken into the &s;tomach, &s;o as to induce &s;ix or &s;ev$n &s;tools every morning, for four or &s;ix weeks, is perhaps the mo&s;t effi|cacious method in common u&s;e. A factitious Harrow gate water may be made probably of greater efficacy than the natural, by di&s;&s;olving one ounce of marine &s;alt, (called bay &s;alt) and half an ounce of mag|ne&s;ia Glauber's &s;alt, (called Ep&s;om &s;alt, or bitter purging &s;alt) in twenty-eight ounces of water. A quarter or half a pint of this is to be taken every hour, or two hours in the morning, till it operates, with a tea-&s;poonful of a &s;olution of liver of &s;ulphur, which is to be made by putting an ounce of hepar &s;ulphuris into half a pint of water. See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 2. 9.</P>

There have been in&s;tances of peo|ple, who could &s;ee better in the gloom of the evening, than in the &s;tronger light of the day; like owls, and bats, and many quadrupeds, and flying in&s;ects. When the eye is inflamed, great light becomes eminently painful, owing to the increa&s;ed irritative motions of the retina, and the con&s;equent increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ation. Thus when the eye is dazzled with &s;udden light, the pain is not owing to the motion of the iris; for it is the contraction of the iris, which relieves the pain from &s;udden light; but to the too violent contractions of the moving fibres, which con&s;titute the extremities of the optic nerve.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Auditus acrior.</HI> The irritative ideas of hearing are &s;o increa&s;ed in energy as to excite our attention. This happens in &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es of the epileptic kind, and in &s;ome fevers. Hence the whi&s;pering of the currents of air in a room, the re&s;piration of the company, and noi&s;es before unperceived, become trouble&s;ome; and &s;ounds louder than u&s;ual, or unexpected, produce &s;tarting, and convul&s;ions.</P>

<P N="7">7. <HI>Sen&s;us exten&s;ionis acrior.</HI> Acuter &s;en&s;e of exten&s;ion. The &s;en&s;e
<PB N="60" REF="690">
of exten&s;ion was &s;poken of in Sect. XIV. 7. and XXXII. 4. The de|fect of di&s;tention in the arterial &s;y&s;tem is accompanied with faintne&s;s; and its exce&s;s with &s;en&s;ations of fulne&s;s, or weight, or pre&s;&s;ure. This however refers only to the va&s;cular mu&s;cles, which are di&s;tended by their appropriated fluids; but the longitudinal mu&s;cles are al&s;o af|fected by different quantities of exten&s;ion, and become violently pain|ful by the exce&s;s of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e pains of mu&s;cles and of membranes are generally divided into acute and dull pains. The former are generally owing to increa&s;e of exten&s;ion, as in pricking the &s;kin with a needle; and the latter gene|rally to defect of exten&s;ion, as in cold head-aches; but if the edge of a knife, or point of a pin, be gradually pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the fibres of mu&s;cles or membranes, there would &s;eem to be three &s;tates or &s;tages of this exten&s;ion of the fibres; which have acquired names according to the degree or kind of &s;en&s;ation produced by the exten&s;ion of them; the&s;e are 1. titillation or tickling. 2. itching, and the 3. &s;marting; as de&s;cribed below. See Sect. XIV. 9.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Titillatio.</HI> Tickling is a plea&s;ureable pain of the &s;en&s;e of exten|&s;ion above mentioned, and therefore excites laughter; as de&s;cribed in Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4. The tickling of the no&s;trils, which precedes the efforts of &s;neezing, is owing to the increa&s;ed irritation occa&s;ioned by external &s;timulus; and is attended with a plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation in con&s;equence of the increa&s;ed action of the part. When this action is exerted in a greater degree, the &s;en&s;ation becomes painful, and the convul&s;ion of &s;neezing en&s;ues; as the pain in tickling the &s;oles of the feet of children is relieved by laughter.</P>
<P>A lady after a brui&s;e on her no&s;e by a fall was affected with ince&s;|&s;ant &s;neezing, and relieved by &s;nuffing &s;tarch up her no&s;trils. Per|petual &s;n$e$zings in the mea&s;les, and in catarrhs from cold, are ow|ing to the &s;timulus of the &s;aline part of the mucous effu&s;ion on the membrane of the no&s;trils. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 2.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="61" REF="700">
9. <HI>Pruritus.</HI> Itching &s;eems to be a greater degree of titillation, and to be owing to the &s;timulus of &s;ome acrid material, as the matter of the itch; or of the herpes on the &s;crotum, and about the anus; or from tho&s;e univer&s;al eruptions, which attend &s;ome elderly people, who have drank much vinous &s;pirit. It occurs al&s;o, when inflammations are declining, as in the healing of bli&s;ters, or in the cure of ophthal|mia, as the action of the ve&s;&s;els is yet &s;o great as to produce &s;en&s;ation; which, like the titillations that occa&s;ion laughter, is perpetually chang|ing from plea&s;ure to pain.</P>
<P>When the natural efforts of &s;cratching do not relieve the pain of itching, it &s;ometimes increa&s;es &s;o as to induce convul&s;ions and mad|ne&s;s. As in the furor uterinus, and &s;atyria&s;is, and in the &s;phincter ani and &s;crotum. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 4. 14. IV. 2. 2. 6.</P>

<P N="10">10. <HI>Dolor urens.</HI> Smarting follows the edge of a knife in making a wound, and &s;eems to be owing to the di&s;tention of a part of a fibre, till it breaks. A &s;marting of the &s;kin is liable to affect the &s;cars left by herpes or &s;hingles; and the callous parts of the bottoms of the feet; and around the ba&s;es of corns on the toes; and frequently ex|tends after &s;ciatica along the out&s;ide of the thigh, and of the leg, and part of the foot. All the&s;e may be owing to the &s;timulus of exten|&s;ion, by blood or &s;erum being forced into ve&s;&s;els nearly coale&s;ced.</P>
<P>M. M. Empla&s;trum de minio put like a bandage on the part. Warm fomentation. Oil and camphor rubbed on the part. Oil-&s;ilk covering. A bli&s;ter on the part. Ether, or alcohol, &s;uffered to evapo|rate on the part.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Con&s;ternatio.</HI> Surpri&s;e. As our eyes acquaint us at the &s;ame time with le&s;s than half of the objects, which &s;urround us, we have
<PB N="62" REF="710">
learned to confide much in the organ of hearing to warn us of ap|proaching dangers. Hence it happens, that if any &s;ound &s;trikes us, which we cannot immediately account for, our fears are in&s;tantly alarmed. Thus in great debility of body, the loud clapping of a door, or the fall of a fire-&s;hovel, produces alarm, and &s;ometimes even con|vul&s;ions; the &s;ame occurs from unexpected &s;ights, and in the dark from unexpected objects of touch.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ca&s;es the irritability is le&s;s than natural, though it is erro|neou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed to be greater; and the mind is bu&s;ied in exciting a train of ideas inattentive to external objects; when this train of ideas is di&s;&s;evered by any unexpected &s;timulus, &s;urpri&s;e is excited; as ex|plained in Sect. XVII. 3. 7. and XVIII. 17. then as the &s;en&s;ibility in the&s;e ca&s;es is greater, fear becomes &s;uperadded to the &s;urpri&s;e; and convul&s;ions in con&s;equence of the pain of fear. See Sect. XIX. 2.</P>
<P>The proximate cau&s;e of &s;urpri&s;e is the increa&s;ed irritation induced by &s;ome violent &s;timulus, which di&s;&s;evers our u&s;ual trains of ideas; but in di&s;ea&s;es of inirritability the frequent &s;tarting or &s;urpri&s;e from &s;ounds not uncommon, but rather louder than u&s;ual, as the clapping of a door, &s;hews, that the attention of the patient to a train of &s;en&s;i|tive ideas was previou&s;ly &s;tronger than natural, and indicates an in|cipient delirium; which is therefore worth attending to in febrile di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<P>THE reader &s;hould be here apprized, that the words &s;trength and debility, when applied to animal motions, may properly expre&s;s the quantity of re&s;i&s;tance &s;uch motions may overcome; but that, when they are applied to mean the &s;u&s;ceptibility or in&s;u&s;ceptibility of ani|mal fibres to motion, they become metaphorical terms; as in Sect. XII. 2. 1. and would be better expre&s;&s;ed by the words activity and inactivity.</P>
<P>There are three &s;ources of animal inactivity; fir&s;t, the defect of the natural quantity of &s;timulus on tho&s;e fibres, which have been accu&s;|tomed to perpetual &s;timulus; as the arterial and &s;ecerning &s;y&s;tems. When their accu&s;tomed &s;timulus is for a while intermitted, as when &s;now is applied to the &s;kin of the hands, an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power is produced; and then a degree of &s;timulus, as of heat, &s;ome|what greater than that at pre&s;ent applied, though much le&s;s than the natural quantity, excites the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin into violent action. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that a deficiency of &s;timulus in tho&s;e fibres, which are not &s;ubject to perpetual &s;timulus, as the locomotive mu&s;cles, is not &s;ucceeded by accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power; the&s;e therefore are more liable to become permanently inactive after a diminution of &s;ti|mulus; as in &s;trokes of the pal&s;y, this may be called inactivity from defect of &s;timulus.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd &s;ource of animal inactivity exi&s;ts, when the &s;en&s;orial power in any part of the &s;y&s;tem has been previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted by violent
<PB N="64" REF="730">
&s;timuli; as the eyes after long expo&s;ure to great light; or the &s;tomach, to repeated &s;pirituous potation; this may be termed inac|tivity from exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power. See Sect. XII. 2. 1.</P>
<P N="3">3. But there is a third &s;ource of inactivity owing to the deficient production of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain; and hence &s;timuli &s;tronger than natural are required to produce the accu&s;tomed motions of the ar|terial &s;y&s;tem; in this ca&s;e there is no accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power produced; as in the inactivity owing to defect of &s;timulus; nor any previous exhau&s;tion of it, as in the inactivity owing to exce&s;s of &s;timulus.</P>
<P>This third kind of inactivity cau&s;es many of the di&s;ea&s;es of this genus; which are therefore in general to be remedied by &s;uch medi|cines as promote a greater production of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain; as the incitantia, con&s;i&s;ting of wine, beer, and opium, in &s;mall re|peated quantities; and &s;econdly of &s;uch as &s;imply &s;timulate the arte|rial and glandular &s;y&s;tem into their natural actions; as &s;mall repeated bli&s;ters, &s;pices, and e&s;&s;ential oils.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Febris inirritativa.</HI> Inirritative fever. This is the typhus mitior, or nervous fever of &s;ome writers; it is attended with weak pul&s;e without inflammation, or &s;ymptoms of putridity, as they have been called. When the production of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain is le&s;s than u&s;ual, the pul&s;e becomes quick as well as weak; and the heart &s;ometimes trembles like the limb$ of old age, or of enfeebled drunkards; and when this force of the contractions of the heart and arteries is dimini&s;hed, the blood is pu&s;hed on with le&s;s energy, as well
<PB N="65" REF="740">
as in le&s;s quantity, and thence its &s;timulus on their &s;ides is dimini&s;hed in a duplicate ratio. In compre&s;&s;ions of the brain, as in apoplexy, the pul&s;e becomes &s;lower and fuller; for in that di&s;ea&s;e, as in natural &s;leep, the irritative motions of the heart and arteries are not dimini&s;h|ed, volition alone is &s;u&s;pended or de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>If the ab&s;orption of the terminations of the veins is not equally im|paired with the force of the heart and arteries, the blood is taken up by the veins the in&s;tant it arrives at their extremities; the capillary ve&s;&s;els are left empty, and there is le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance to the current of the blood from the arteries; hence the pul&s;e becomes empty, as well as weak and quick; the veins of the &s;kin are fuller than the arteries of it; and its appearance becomes pale, blui&s;h, and &s;hrunk.

<P>When this pul&s;e per&s;i&s;ts many hours, it con&s;titutes the febris inirri|tativa, or typhus, or nervous fever, of &s;ome writers; it is attended with little heat, the urine is generally of a natural colour, though in le&s;s quantity; with great pro&s;tration of &s;trength, and much di&s;turb|ance of the faculties of the mind. Its immediate cau&s;e &s;eems to be a deficient &s;ecretion of the &s;en&s;orial power from the inaction of the brain; hence almo&s;t the whole of the &s;en&s;orial power is expended in the performance of the motions nece&s;&s;ary to life, and little of it can be &s;pared for the voluntary actions of the locomotive mu&s;cles, or organs of &s;en&s;e, &s;ee Cla&s;s I. 2. 5. 3. Its more remote cau&s;e may be from a paraly&s;is or death of &s;ome other part of the body; as of the &s;pleen, when a tumour is felt on the left &s;ide, as in &s;ome intermittents; or of the kidnies, when the urine continues pale and in &s;mall quan|tity.

It continues three or four weeks like a fever, and then either termi|nates in health, or the patient &s;inks into one kind of apoplexy, and peri&s;hes. Many &s;ymptoms, which attend inirritative fevers, accom|pany this di&s;ea&s;e, as cold hands and feet at periodic times, &s;curf on the tongue, want of appetite, muddy urine, with pains of the head, and &s;ometimes vertigo, and vomiting.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e differs from the inirritative fever by the pul&s;e not being more frequent than in health. The want of appetite and of dige&s;tion is a principal &s;ymptom, and probably is the cau&s;e of the univer&s;al de|bility, which may be occa&s;ioned by the want of nouri&s;hment. The vertigo is a &s;ymptom of inirritability, as &s;hewn in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 2. 6. the muddy urine is owing to increa&s;ed ab&s;orption from the bladder in con&s;equence of the dimini&s;hed cutaneous and cellular ab&s;orption, as in ana&s;arca, explained in Sect. XXIX. 5. 1. and is therefore a con&s;e|quence of the inirritability of that part of the &s;y&s;tem; the foul tongue is owing to an increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of the thinner part of the mucus in con&s;equence of the general deficiency of fluid, which &s;hould be ab|&s;orbed by the &s;kin and &s;tomach. The &s;ickne&s;s is owing to decrea&s;ed action of the &s;tomach, which is probably the primary di&s;ea&s;e, and is connected with the vertigo.</P>

In this extreme debility there is rea&s;on to be|lieve, that &s;ome voluntary power during our waking hours is employed to aid the irritative &s;timuli in carrying on the circulation of the blood through the lungs; in the &s;ame manner as we u&s;e voluntary exertions, when we li&s;ten to weak &s;ounds, or wi&s;h to view an object by a &s;mall light; in &s;leep volition is &s;u&s;pended, and the deficient irritation alone is not &s;ufficient to carry on the pulmonary circulation. This expla|nation &s;eems the mo&s;t probable one, becau&s;e in ca&s;es of apoplexy the irritative motions of the arterial &s;y&s;tem do not &s;eem to be impaired, nor in common &s;leep.

<P N="10">10. <HI>Palpitatio cordis.</HI> The palpitation of the heart frequently at|tends the haemoptoe above mentioned; and con&s;i&s;ts in an ineffectual exertion of the heart to pu&s;h forwards its contents in due time, and with due force. The remote cau&s;e is frequently &s;ome impediment to the general circulation; as the torpor of the capillaries in cold pa|roxy&s;ms of fever, or great adhe&s;ions of the lungs.

The &s;mall quantity and difficulty of the di&s;charge is owing to arterial inactivity, as in chloro&s;is. Whence it happens, that chalybeate medicines are of efficacy both to &s;top or prevent too great men&s;truation, and to promote or increa&s;e deficient men&s;truation; as the former is owing to inirritability of the veins, and the latter of the arteries of the uterus.

In that unnatural practice of &s;ome ha&s;ty accoucheurs of introducing the hand into the uterus immediately after the delivery of the child, and forci|bly bringing away the placenta, it frequently happens, that a part of it is left behind; and the uterus, not having power to exclude &s;o &s;mall a portion of it, is prevented from complete contraction, and a great haemorrhage en&s;ues. In this circum&s;tance a bandage with a thick compre&s;s on the lower part of the belly, by appre&s;&s;ing the &s;ides of the uterus on the remaining part of the placenta, is likely to check the haemorrhage, like the application of a pledget of any &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance on a bleeding ve&s;&s;el.</P>

<P>Mi&s;carriages more frequently happen from eruptive fevers, and from rheumatic ones, than from other inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es.

The extrava&s;ation of blood in brui&s;es, or in &s;ome fevers, or after death in &s;ome patients, e&s;pecially in the parts which were expo&s;ed to pre&s;&s;ure, is owing to the fine terminations of the veins having been mechanically compre&s;&s;ed &s;o as to prevent their ab|&s;orbing the blood from the capillaries, or to their inactivity from di&s;ea&s;e. The blood when extrava&s;ated undergoes a chemical change before it is &s;ufficiently fluid to be taken up by the lymphatic ab&s;orb|ents, and in that proce&s;s changes its colour to green and then yellow.</P>

ruptured, and effu&s;es the blood into the cellular membrane round the inert termination of the vein. This is generally e&s;teemed a &s;ign of the putrid &s;tate of the blood, or that &s;tate contrary to the in|flammatory one. As it attends &s;ome inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es which are attended with great inirritability, as in the confluent &s;mall pox. But it al&s;o attends the &s;curvy, where no fever exi&s;ts, and it therefore &s;imply announces the inactivity of the terminations of &s;ome veins; and is thence indeed a bad &s;ymptom in fevers, as a mark of approach|ing inactivity of the whole &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem, or death. The blue colour of &s;ome children's arms or faces in very cold weather is owing in like manner to the torpor of the ab&s;orbent terminations of the veins, whence the blood is accumulated in them, and &s;ometimes bur&s;ts them.</P>

Coldne&s;s of the extremi|ties, without fever, with dry pale &s;kin, is a &s;ymptom of general de|bility, owing to the decrea&s;ed action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, and of the capillary ve&s;&s;els; whence the per&s;pirable matter is &s;ecreted in le&s;s quantity, and in con&s;equence the &s;kin is le&s;s warm. This coldne&s;s is ob&s;ervable at the extremities of the limbs, ears, and no&s;e, more than in any other parts: as a larger &s;urface is here expo&s;ed to the contact of the air, or clothes, and thence the heat is more ha&s;tily carried away.</P>
<P>The pain, which accompanies the coldne&s;s of the &s;kin, is owing to the deficient exertion of the &s;ubcutaneous ve&s;&s;els, and probably to the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the extremities of their nerves. See Sect. XII. 5. 3. XIV. 6. XXXII. 3. and Cla&s;s I. 2. 4. 1.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Pallor fugitivus.</HI> The fugitive palene&s;s, which accompanies the coldne&s;s of the extremities, is owing to a le&s;s quantity of blood pa&s;&s;ing through the capillaries of the &s;kin in a given time; where the ab&s;orbent power of the veins is at the &s;ame time much dimini&s;hed, a part of the blood lingers at their junction with the capillary arteries, and a blui&s;h tinge is mixed with the palene&s;s; as is &s;een in the loo&s;e

&s;kin under the eye-lids, and is always a mark of temporary debility. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 4. 4. Where the palene&s;s of the &s;kin is owing to the deficiency of red globules in the blood, it is joined with a yellowi&s;h tinge; which is the colour of the &s;erum, with which the blood then abounds, as in chloro&s;is, and in torpor or paraly&s;is of the liver, and is often mi&s;taken for a &s;uperabundance of bile.</P>
<P>A permanent palene&s;s of the &s;kin is owing to the coale&s;cence of the minute arteries, as in old age. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 9. There is another &s;ource of palene&s;s from the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of the terminations of the veins, as when vinegar is applied to the lips. See Sect. XXVII. 1. and another from the retrograde motions of the capillaries and fine extremities of the arteries. See Cla&s;s II. 3. 1. 1.</P>

He had been for many years a great con&s;umer of tobacco, in&s;omuch that he chewed that noxious drug all the morning, and &s;moaked it all the afternoon. As the &s;ecretion from the pancreas re&s;embles &s;aliva in its general appear|ance, and probably in its office of a&s;&s;i&s;ting dige&s;tion, by preventing the fermentation of the aliment; as would appear by the experiments of Pringle and Macbride; there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that a &s;ympathy may exi&s;t between the &s;alivary and pancreatic glands; and that the perpetual &s;timulus of the former by tobacco might in proce&s;s of time injure the latter.

<P N="11">11. <HI>Canities.</HI> Grey hair. In the injection of the ve&s;&s;els of animals for the purpo&s;es of anatomical preparations, the colour of the injected fluid will not pa&s;s into many very minute ve&s;&s;els; which neverthele&s;s uncoloured water, or &s;pirits, or quick&s;ilver will p$rmeate. The &s;ame occurs in the filtration of &s;ome coloured fluids through paper, or very fine &s;and, where the colouring matter is not perfectly di&s;&s;olved, but only diffu&s;ed through the liquid. This has led &s;ome to imagine, that the cau&s;e of the whitene&s;s of the hair in elderly people may ari&s;e from the diminution, or greater tenuity, of the glandular ve&s;&s;els, which &s;ecrete the mucus, which hardens into hair; and that the &s;ame difference of the tenuity of the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els may po&s;&s;ibly make the difference of colour of the &s;ilk from different &s;ilk-worms, which i$ of all &s;hades from yellow to white.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="910">
But as the &s;ecreted fluids are not the con&s;equence of mechanical fil|tration, but of animal &s;election; we mu&s;t look out for another cau&s;e, which mu&s;t be found in the decrea&s;ing activity of the glands, as we advance in life; and which affects many of our other &s;ecretions as well as that of the mucus, which forms the hair. Hence grey hairs are produced on the faces of hor&s;es by whatever injures the glands at their roots, as by corro&s;ive bli&s;ters; and frequently on the human &s;ub|ject by external injuries on the head; and &s;ometimes by fevers. And as the grey colour of hair con&s;i&s;ts in its want of tran&s;parency, like water converted into &s;now; there is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that a defect of &s;ecreted moi&s;ture &s;imply may be the cau&s;e of this kind of opacity, as explained in Cataracta, Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 13.</P>
<P>M. M. Whatever prevents the inirritability and in&s;en&s;ibility of the &s;y&s;tem, that is, whatever prevents the approach of old age, will &s;o far counteract the production of grey hairs, which is a &s;ymptom of it. For this purpo&s;e in people, who are not corpulent, and perhaps in tho&s;e who are &s;o, the warm bath twice or thrice a week is particular|ly &s;erviceable. See Sect.

13. <HI>Cataracta</HI> is an opacity of the cry&s;talline lens of the eye. It is a di&s;ea&s;e of light-coloured eyes, as the gutta &s;erena is of dark ones. On cutting off with &s;ci&s;&s;ars the cornea of a calf's eye, and hold|ing it in the palm of one's hand, &s;o as to gain a proper light, the ar|tery, which &s;upplies nutriment to the cry&s;talline humour, is ea&s;ily and beautifully &s;een; as it ri&s;es from the centre of the optic nerve through the vitreous humour to the cry&s;talline. It is this point, where the artery enters the eye through the cineritious part of the optic nerve, (which is in part near the middle of the nerve,) which is without &s;en&s;ibility to light; as is &s;hewn by fixing three papers, each of them about half an inch in diameter, again&s;t a wall about a foot di&s;tant from each other, about the height of the eye; and then look|ing at the middle one, with one eye, and retreating till you lo&s;e &s;ight of one of the external papers. Now as the animal grows older, the artery becomes le&s;s vi&s;ible, and perhaps carries only a tran&s;parent fluid, and at length in &s;ome &s;ubjects I &s;uppo&s;e cea&s;es to be pervious; then it follows, that the cry&s;talline lens, lo&s;ing &s;ome fluid, and gaining none, becomes dry, and in con&s;equence opake; for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that wet or oiled paper is more tran&s;parent than when it is dry, as explain|ed in Cla&s;s I. 1. 4. 1. The want of moi&s;ture in the cornea of old people, when the exhalation becomes greater than the &s;upply, is the cau&s;e of its want of tran&s;parency; and which like the cry&s;talline gains rather a milky opacity. The &s;ame analogy may be u&s;ed to explain the whitene&s;s of the hair of old people, which lo&s;es its pellucidity along with its moi&s;ture. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 11.</P>
<P>M. M. Small electric &s;hocks through the eye. A quarter of a grain of corro&s;ive &s;ublimate of mercury di&s;&s;olved in brandy, or taken in a pill, twice a day for &s;ix weeks. Couching by depre&s;&s;ion, or by ex|traction. The former of the&s;e operations is much to be preferred to the latter, though the latter is at this time &s;o fa&s;hionable, that a &s;ur|geon is almo&s;t compelled to u&s;e it, le&s;t he &s;hould not be thought an expert operator. For depre&s;&s;ing the cataract is attended with no pain,
<PB N="84" REF="930">
no danger, no confinement, and may be as readily repea$ed, if the cry&s;talline &s;hould ri&s;e again to the centre of the eye. The $xtraction of the cataract is attended with con&s;iderable pain, with long confine|ment, generally with fever, always with inflammation, and frequently with irreparable injury to the iris, and con&s;equent danger to the whole eye. Yet has this operation of extraction been trumpeted into univer|&s;al fa&s;hion for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e it is difficult to perform, and therefore keeps the bu&s;ine&s;s in the hands of a few empyrics, who re|ceive larger rewards, regardle&s;s of the hazard, which is encountered by the flattered patient.</P>
<P>A friend of mine returned ye&s;terday from London after an ab&s;ence of many weeks; he had a cataract in a proper &s;tate for the operation, and in &s;pite of my earne&s;t exhortation to the contrary, was prevailed upon to have it extracted rather than depre&s;&s;ed. He was confined to his bed three weeks after the operation, and is now returned with the iris adhering on one &s;ide &s;o as to make an oblong aperture; and which is nearly, if not totally, without contraction, and thus greatly impedes the little vi&s;ion, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Whereas I &s;aw &s;ome patients couched by depre&s;&s;ion many years ago by a then celebrated empyric, Chevalier Taylor, who were not confined above a day or two, that the eye might gradually be accu&s;tomed to light, and who &s;aw as well as by extraction, perhaps better, without either pain, or inflammation, or any hazard of lo&s;ing the eye.</P>
<P>As the inflammation of the iris is probably owing to forcing the cry&s;talline through the ap$rture of it in the operation of extracting it, could it not be done more &s;afely by making the opening behind the iris and ciliary proce&s;s into the vitreous humour? but the operation would &s;till be more painful, more dangerous, and not more u&s;eful than that by depre&s;&s;ing it.</P>

<P>The earthy part of bones in this di&s;ea&s;e of the innutrition of them &s;eems to &s;uffer a &s;olution, and reab&s;orption; while the &s;ecerning ve&s;|&s;els do not &s;upply a &s;ufficient quantity of calcareous earth and pho&s;|phoric acid, which con&s;titute the &s;ub&s;tance of bones. As calcareous earth abounds every where, is the want of pho&s;phoric acid the remote cau&s;e? One cau&s;e of this malady is given in the Philo&s;ophic Tran&s;|actions, where the patient had been accu&s;tomed to drink large quan|tities of vinegar. Two ca&s;es are de&s;cribed by Mr. Gouch. In one ca&s;e, which I &s;aw, a con&s;iderable quantity of calcareous earth, and afterwards of bone-a&s;hes, and of decoction of madder, and al&s;o of &s;ublimate of mercury, were given without effect. All the bones be|came &s;oft, many of them broke, and the patient &s;eemed to die from the want of being able to di&s;tend her che&s;t owing to the &s;oftne&s;s of the ribs.</P>
<P>M. M. Salt of urine, called &s;al microco&s;micum, pho&s;phorated &s;oda. Calcined hart&s;horn. Bone-a&s;hes.

The calcareous earth in the&s;e waters might po&s;&s;ibly be carried to the bones, as madder is known to colour them. Warm bath. Volatile or fixed alcali as a lotion on the &s;pine, or e&s;&s;ential oils.</P>
<P>The innutrition of the bones is often fir&s;t to be perceived by the difficulty of breathing and palpitation of the heart on walking a little
<PB N="86" REF="950">
fa&s;ter than u&s;ual, which I &s;uppo&s;e is owing to the &s;oftne&s;s of the ends of the ribs adjoining to the &s;ternum; on which account they do not perfectly di&s;tend the che&s;t, when they are rai&s;ed by the pectoral and interco&s;tal mu&s;cles with greater force than u&s;ual. After this the &s;pine becomes curved both by the &s;oftne&s;s of its vertebrae, and for the pur|po&s;e of making room for the di&s;turbed heart. See Species 16 of this genus.</P>
<P>As the&s;e patients are pale and weak, there would &s;eem to be a de|ficiency of oxygene in their blood, and in con&s;equence a deficiency of pho&s;phoric acid; which is probably produced by oxygene in the act of re&s;piration.</P>
<P>Mr. Bonhome in the Chemical Annals, Augu&s;t, 1793, &s;uppo&s;es the rickets to ari&s;e from the prevalence of vegetable or acetous acid, which is known to &s;often bones out of the body. Mr. Dettaen &s;eems to have e&s;pou&s;ed a &s;imilar opinion, and both of them in con&s;equence give alcalies and te&s;tacea. If this theory was ju&s;t, the &s;oft bones of &s;uch patients &s;hould &s;hew evident marks of &s;uch acidity after death; which I believe has not been ob&s;erved. Nor is it analogous to other animal facts, that nutritious fluids &s;ecreted by the fine&s;t ve&s;&s;els of the body &s;hould be &s;o little animalized, as to retain acetous or vegetable acidity.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s attending the following ca&s;e in &s;o &s;hort a time as a fortnight I a&s;cribed principally to the u&s;e of the warm bath; in which the patient continued for full half an hour every night, in the degree of heat, which was mo&s;t grateful to her &s;en&s;ation, which might be I &s;uppo&s;e about 94.

She took twice a day twenty grains of extract of bark, twenty grains of &s;oda pho&s;phorata, and ten grains of chalk, and ten of calcined hart&s;horn mixed into a powder with ten drops of laudanum; with fle&s;h food both to dinner and &s;upper; and port wine and water in&s;tead of the &s;mall beer, &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to; &s;he lay on a &s;ofa frequently in a day, and occa&s;ionally u&s;ed a neck-&s;wing.</P>

<PB N="88" REF="970">
nature had bent the &s;pine outwards to give room to the enlarged heart; or that the malformation of the che&s;t had compre&s;&s;ed and impeded the movements of the heart. But a few weeks ago on attending a young lady about ten years old, who&s;e &s;pine had lately began to be di&s;torted, with very great difficulty and quickne&s;s of re&s;piration, and alarming palpitation of the heart, I convinced my&s;elf, that the pal|pitation and difficult re&s;piration were the effect of the change of the cavity of the che&s;t from the di&s;tortion of the &s;pine; and that the whole was therefore a di&s;ea&s;e of the innutrition or &s;oftne&s;s of the bones.</P>

<P>Delicate young ladies are very liable to become awry at many board|ing &s;chools. This is occa&s;ioned principally by their being obliged too long to pre&s;erve an erect attitude, by &s;itting on forms many hours to|gether. To prevent this the &s;chool-&s;eats &s;hould have either backs, on which they may occa&s;ionally re&s;t them&s;elves; or de&s;ks before them, on which they may occa&s;ionally lean. This is a thing of greater con|&s;equence than may appear to tho&s;e, who have not attended to it.</P>
<P>When the lea&s;t tendency to become awry is ob&s;erved, they &s;hould be advi&s;ed to lie down on a bed or &s;ofa for an hour in the middle of the day for many months; which generally prevents the increa&s;e of this deformity by taking off for a time the pre&s;&s;ure on the &s;pine of the back, and it at the &s;ame time tends to make them grow tall$r. Young per&s;ons, when nicely mea&s;ured, are found to be half an inch higher in a morning than at night; as is well known to tho&s;e, who inli&s;t very young men for &s;oldiers. This is owing to the cartilages be|tween the bones of the back becoming compre&s;&s;ed by the weight of the head and &s;houlders on them during the day. It is the &s;ame

pre&s;&s;ure which produces curvatures and di&s;tortions of the &s;pine in growing children, where the bones are &s;ofter than u&s;ual; and which may thus be relieved by an horizontal po&s;ture for an hour in the mid|dle of the day, or by being frequently allowed to lean on a chair, or to play on the ground on a carpet.</P>
<P>Young ladies &s;hould al&s;o be directed, where two &s;leep in a bed, to change every night, or every week, their &s;ides of the bed; which will prevent their tendency to &s;leep always on the &s;ame &s;ide; which is not only liable to produce crookedne&s;s, but al&s;o to occa&s;ion di&s;ea&s;es by the internal parts being &s;o long kept in uniform contact as to grow together. For the &s;ame rea&s;on they &s;hould not be allowed to &s;it always on the &s;ame &s;ide of the fire or window, becau&s;e they will then be inclined too frequently to bend them&s;elves to one &s;ide.</P>
<P>Another great cau&s;e of injury to the &s;hape of young ladies is from the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;tays, or other tight bandages, which at the &s;ame time cau&s;e other di&s;ea&s;es by changing the form or &s;ituation of the in|ternal parts. If a hard part of the &s;tays, even a knot of the thread, with which they are &s;ewed together, is pre&s;&s;ed hard upon one &s;ide more than the other, the child bends from the &s;ide mo&s;t painful, and thus occa&s;ions a curvature of the &s;pine. To counteract this effect &s;uch &s;tays, as have fewe&s;t hard parts, and e&s;pecially &s;uch as can be daily or weekly turned, are preferable to others.</P>
<P>Where frequent lying down on a &s;ofa in the day-time, and &s;wing|ing frequently for a &s;hort time by the hands or head, with loo&s;e dre&s;s, do not relieve a beginning di&s;tortion of the back; recour&s;e may be had to a chair with &s;tuffed moveable arms for the purpo&s;e of &s;u&s;pend|ing the weight of the body by cu&s;hions under the arm-pits, like re&s;t|ing on crutches, or like the leading &s;trings of infants. From the top of the back of the &s;ame chair a curved &s;teel bar may al&s;o project to &s;u&s;pend the body occa&s;ionally, or in part by the head, like the &s;wing above mentioned. The u&s;e of this chair is more efficacious in &s;traightening the &s;pine, than &s;imply lying down horizontally; as it
<PB N="90" REF="1000">
not only takes off the pre&s;&s;ure of the head and &s;houlders from the &s;pine, but at the &s;ame time the inferior parts of the body contribute to draw the &s;pine &s;traight by their weight; or la&s;tly, recour&s;e may be had to a &s;pinal machine fir&s;t de&s;cribed in the Memoires of the academy of &s;urgery in Paris, Vol. III. p. 600, by M. Le Vacher, and &s;ince made by Mr. Jones, at N^o 6, North-&s;treet, Tottenham-court Road, London, which &s;u&s;pends the head, and places the weight of it on the hips. This machine is capable of improvement by joints in the bar at the back of it, to permit the body to bend forwards without dimini&s;h|ing the exten&s;ion of the &s;pine.</P>
<P>The objections of this machine of M. Vacher, which is made by Mr. Jones, are fir&s;t, that it is worn in the day-time, and has a very un&s;ightly appearance. Mr. Jones has endeavoured to remedy this, by taking away the curved bar over the head, and &s;ub&s;tituting in its place a forked bar, ri&s;ing up behind each ear, with webs fa&s;tened to it, which pa&s;s under the chin and occiput. But this is not an im|provement, but a deterioration of M. Vacher's machine, as it prevents the head from turning with facility to either &s;ide. Another objection is, that its being worn, when the mu&s;cles of the back are in action, it is rather calculated to prevent the curvature of the &s;pine from be|coming greater, than to extend the &s;pine, and dimini&s;h its curvature.</P>
<P>For this latter purpo&s;e I have made a &s;teel bow, as de&s;cribed in the annexed plate, which receives the head longitudinally from the fore|head to the occiput; having a fork furni&s;hed with a web to &s;u&s;tain the chin, and another to &s;u&s;tain the occiput. The &s;ummit of the bow is fixed by a &s;wivel to the board going behind the head of the bed above the pillow. The bed is to be inclined from the head to the feet about twelve or &s;ixteen inches. Hence the patient would be con&s;tantly &s;liding down during &s;leep, unle&s;s &s;upported by this bow, with webbed forks, covered al&s;o with fur, placed beneath the chin, and beneath the occiput. There are al&s;o proper webs lined with fur for the hands to take hold off occa&s;ionally, and al&s;o to go under the arms. By

the&s;e means I &s;hould hope great advantage from gradually extending the &s;pine during the inactivity of the mu&s;cles of the back; and that it may be done without di&s;turbing the &s;leep of the patient, and if this &s;hould happen, the bow is made to open by a joint at the &s;ummit of it, &s;o as to be in&s;tantly di&s;engaged from the neck by the hand of the wearer. This bow I have not yet had opportunity to make u&s;e of, but it may be had from Mr. Harri&s;on, white&s;mith, Bridge-gate, Derby.</P>
<P>It will be from hence ea&s;ily perceived, that all other methods of confining or directing the growth of young people &s;hould be u&s;ed with great &s;kill; &s;uch as back-boards, or bandages, or &s;tocks for the feet; and that their application &s;hould not be continued too long at a time, le$t wor&s;e con&s;equences &s;hould en&s;ue, than the deformity they were de&s;igned to remove. To this may be added, that the &s;tiff erect atti|tude taught by &s;ome modern dancing ma&s;ters does not contribute to the grace of per&s;on, but rather militates again&s;t it; as is well &s;een in one of the prints in Hogarth's Analy&s;is of Beauty; and is exemplifyed by the ea&s;y grace of &s;ome of the antient &s;tatues, as of the Venus de Medici, and the Antinous, and in the works of &s;ome modern arti&s;ts, as in a beautiful print of Hebe feeding an Eagle, painted by Hamil|ton, and engraved by Eginton, and many of the figures of Angelica Kauffman.</P>
<P>Where the bone of one of the vertebrae of the back has been &s;welled on both &s;ides of it, &s;o as to become protuberant, i&s;&s;ues near the &s;well|ed part have been found of great &s;ervice, as mentioned in Species 18 of this genus. This has induced me to propo&s;e in curvatures of the &s;pine, to put an i&s;&s;ue on the out&s;ide of the curve, where it could be certainly a&s;certained, as the bones on the convex &s;ide of the curve mu&s;t be enlarged; in one ca&s;e I thought this of &s;ervice, and recom|mend the further trial of it.</P>
<P>In the tendency to curvature of the &s;pine, whatever &s;trengthens the general con&s;titution is of &s;ervice; as the u&s;e of the cold bath in the

&s;ummer months. This however requires &s;ome re&s;triction both in re|&s;pect to the degree of coldne&s;s of the bath, the time of continuing in it, and the &s;ea&s;on of the year. Common &s;prings, which are of forty|eight degrees of heat, are too cold for tender con&s;titutions, whether of children or adults, and frequently do them great and irreparable in|jury. The coldne&s;s of river water in the &s;ummer months, which is about &s;ixty-eight degrees, or that of Matlock, which is about &s;ixty|eight, or of Buxton, which is eighty-two, are much to be preferred. The time of continuing in the bath &s;hould be but a minute or two, or not &s;o long as to occa&s;ion a trembling of the limbs from cold. In re&s;pect to the &s;ea&s;on of the year, delicate children &s;hould certainly only bathe in the &s;ummer months; as the going frequently into the cold air in winter will an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of the cold bath.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>Claudicatio coxaria.</HI> Lamene&s;s of the hip. A nodding of the thigh-bone is &s;aid to be produced in feeble children by the &s;oftne&s;s of the neck or upper part of that bone beneath the cartilage; which is naturally bent, and in this di&s;ea&s;e bends more downwards, or nods, by the pre&s;&s;ure of the body; and thus renders one leg apparently &s;horter than the other. In other ca&s;es the end of the bone is protruded out of its &s;ocket, by inflammation or enlargement of the cartilages or liga|ments of the joint, &s;o that it re&s;ts on &s;ome part of the edge of the acetabulum, which in time becomes filled up. When the legs are &s;traight, as in &s;tanding erect, there is no verticillary motion in the knee-joint; all the motion then in turning out the toes further than nature de&s;igned, mu&s;t be obtained by &s;training in &s;ome degree this head of the thigh-bone, or the acetabulum, or cavity, in which it moves. This has induced me to believe, that this misfortune of the nodding of the head by the bone, or partial di&s;location of it, by which one leg becomes &s;horter than the other, is &s;ometimes occa&s;ioned by making very young children &s;tand in what are called &s;tocks; that is
<PB N="93" REF="1040">
with their heels together, and their toes quite out. Whence the &s;ocket of the thigh-bone becomes inflamed and painful, or the neck of the bone is bent downward and outwards.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e there is no expectation of recovering the &s;traightne&s;s of the end of the bone; but the&s;e patients are liable to another misfor|tune, that is, to acquire afterwards a di&s;tortion of the &s;pine; for as one leg is &s;horter than the other, they &s;ink on that &s;ide, and in con|&s;equence bend the upper part of their bodies, as their &s;houlders, the contrary way, to balance them&s;elves; and then again the neck is bent back again towards the lame &s;ide, to pre&s;erve the head perpendicular; and thus the figure becomes quite di&s;torted like the letter S, owing originally to the deficiency of the length of one limb. The only way to prevent this curvature of the &s;pine is for the child to wear a high-heeled &s;hoe or patten on the lame foot, &s;o as to &s;upport that &s;ide on the &s;ame level with the other, and thus to prevent a greater deformity.</P>
<P>I have this day &s;een a young lady about twelve, who does not limp or waddle in walking; but neverthele&s;s, when &s;he &s;tands or &s;its, &s;he &s;inks down towards her right &s;ide, and turns out that toe more than the other. Hence, both as &s;he &s;its and &s;tands, &s;he bends her body to the right; whence her head would hang a little over her right &s;houlder: but to replace this perpendicularly, &s;he lifts up her left &s;houlder and contracts the mu&s;cles on that &s;ide of the neck; which are therefore become thicker and &s;tronger by their continued action; but there is not yet any very perceptible di&s;tortion of the &s;pine.</P>
<P>As her right toe is turned outward rather more than natural, this &s;hews the di&s;ea&s;e to be in the hip-joint; becau&s;e, when the limb is &s;tretched out, the toe cannot turn horizontally in the lea&s;t without moving the end of the thigh-bone; although when the knee is bent, the toe can be turned through one third or half of a circle by the rotation of the tibia and fibula of the leg round each other. Hence
<PB N="94" REF="1050">
if children are &s;et in &s;tocks with their heels touching each other as they &s;it, and are then made to ri&s;e up, till they &s;tand erect, the &s;ocket or head of the thigh-bone becomes injured, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e children, who&s;e bones are &s;oft; and a &s;hortne&s;s of that limb &s;ucceeds either by the bending of the neck of the thigh-bone, or by its getting out of the acetabulum; and a con&s;equent ri&s;ing of one &s;houlder, and a curvature of the &s;pine is produced from &s;o di&s;tant a cau&s;e.</P>

<P>The operation for the hare-lip is de&s;cribed by many &s;urgical writers; but there is a per&s;on in London, who makes very ingeni|ous artificial palates; which prevents that defect of &s;peech, which attends this malformation. This factitious palate con&s;i&s;ts of a thin plate of &s;ilver of the &s;hape and form of the roof of the mouth; from the front edge to the back edge of this &s;ilver plate four or five holes are made in a &s;traight line large enough for a needle to pa&s;s through them; on the back of it is then &s;ewed a piece of &s;ponge; which when expanded with moi&s;ture is nearly as large as the &s;ilver plate. This &s;ponge is &s;lipped through the divi&s;ion of the bone of the palate, &s;o as to lie above it, while the &s;ilver plate covers the aperture beneath, and is &s;u&s;pended by the expanding &s;ponge.

And as the ab&s;orbents, which re&s;ume the thinner parts of the bile from the gall-bladder and hepatic ducts, are al&s;o torpid or quie&s;cent, the bile is more dilute, as well as in le&s;s quantity. From the ob&s;truction of the pa&s;&s;age of the blood through the compre&s;&s;ed vena porta the&s;e patients have tumid bellies, and pale bloated countenances; their palene&s;s is probably owing to the de|ficiency of the quantity of red globules in the blood in con&s;equence of the inert &s;tate of the bile.</P>

The &s;welling of the ankles, which frequently attends chloro|&s;is, is another effect of deficient action of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem; and the pale countenance is occa&s;ioned by the deficient quantity of red glo|bules of blood, cau&s;ed by the deficient quantity or acrimony of the bile, and con&s;equent weakne&s;s of the circulation.

11. <HI>Hydrocele.</HI> Drop&s;y of the vagina te&s;tis. Drop&s;ies have been divided into the incy&s;ted and the diffu&s;ed, meaning tho&s;e of the cellu|lar membrane, the cells of which communicate with each other like a &s;ponge, and tho&s;e of any other cavity of the body. The collections of mucous fluids in the various cells and cavities of the body ari&s;e from the torpor of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of tho&s;e parts. It is probable, that in drop&s;ies attended with great thir&s;t the cutaneous ab&s;orbents become paralytic fir&s;t; and then from the great thir&s;t, which is thus occa&s;ion|ed by the want of atmo&s;pheric moi&s;ture, the ab&s;orption of the fat en|&s;ues; as in fevers attended with great thir&s;t, the fat is quickly taken up. See Obe&s;itas I. 2. 3. 16. Some have believed, that the cellular and adipo&s;e membranes are different ones; as no fat is ever depo&s;ited in the eye-lids or &s;crotum, both which places are very liable to be di&s;|tended with the mucilaginous fluid of the ana&s;arca, and with air in Emphy&s;ema. Sometimes a gradual ab&s;orption of the accumulated fluid takes place, and the thinner parts being taken up, there remains a more vi&s;cid fluid, or almo&s;t a &s;olid in the part, as in &s;ome &s;welled legs, which can not ea&s;ily be indented by the pre&s;&s;ure of the finger, and are called &s;corbutic. Sometimes the paraly&s;is of the ab&s;orbents is com|pletely removed, and the whole is again taken up into the circulation.</P>
<P>The Hydrocele is known by a tumor of the &s;crotum, which is without pain, gradually produced, with fluctuation, and a degree of pellucidity, when a candle is held behind it; it is the mo&s;t &s;imple in|cy&s;ted drop&s;y, as it is not in general complicated with other di&s;ea&s;es, as a&s;cites with &s;chirrous liver, and hydrocephalus internus, with general debility. The cure of this di&s;ea&s;e is effected by different ways; it con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;charging the water by an external aperture; and by &s;o &s;ar inflaming the cy&s;t and te&s;ticle, that they afterwards grow together, and thus prevent in future any &s;ecretion or effu&s;ion of mucus; the di&s;ea&s;e is thus cured, not by the revive&s;cence of the ab&s;orbent power of the lymphatics, but by the prevention of &s;ecretion by the adhe&s;ion of the vagina to the te&s;tis. This I believe is performed with le&s;s pain,
<PB N="104" REF="1150">
and is more certainly manageable by tapping, or di&s;charging the fluid by means of a trocar, and after the evacuation of it to fill the cy&s;t with a mixture of wine and water for a few minutes till the nece&s;&s;ary de|gree of &s;timulus is produced, and then to withdraw it; as recommend|ed by Mr. Earle. See al&s;o Medical Commentaries by Dr. Duncan, for 1793.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Hydrocephalus internus,</HI> or drop&s;y of the ventricles of the brain, is fatal to many children, and &s;ome adults. When this di&s;ea&s;e is le&s;s in quantity, it probably produces a fever, termed a nervous fever, and which is &s;ometimes called a worm fever, according to the opinion of Dr. Gilchri&s;t, in the Scots Medical e&s;&s;ays. This fever is attended with great inirritability, as appears from the dilated pupils of the eyes, in which it corre&s;ponds with the drop&s;y of the brain. And the latter di&s;ea&s;e has its paroxy&s;ms of quick pul&s;e, and in that re&s;pect corre&s;ponds with other fevers with inirritability.</P>
<P>The hydrocephalus internus is di&s;tingui&s;hed from apoplexy by its being attended with fever, and from nervous fever by the paroxy&s;ms being very irregular, with perfect intermi&s;&s;ions many times in a day. In nervous fever the pain of the head generally affects the middle of the forehead; in hydrocephalus internus it is generally on one &s;ide of the head. One of the earlie&s;t criterions is the patient being unea&s;y o$ rai&s;ing his head from the pillow, and wi&s;hing to lie down again im|mediately; which I &s;uppo&s;e is owing to the pre&s;&s;ure of the water on the larger trunks of the blood-ve&s;&s;els entering the cavity being more intolerable than on the &s;maller ones; for if the larger trunks are com|pre&s;&s;ed, it mu&s;t inconvenience the branches al&s;o; but if &s;ome of the &s;mall branches are compre&s;&s;ed only, the trunks are not &s;o immediate|ly incommoded.</P>
<P>Bli&s;ters on the head, and mercurial ointment externally, with calo|mel internally, are principally recommended in this fatal di&s;ea&s;e. When the patient cannot bear to be rai&s;ed up in bed without great
<PB N="105" REF="1160">
unea&s;ine&s;s, it is a bad &s;ymptom. So I believe is dea&s;ne&s;s, which is commonly mi&s;taken for &s;tupor. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 5. 6. And when the dilatation of the pupil of either eye, or the &s;quinting is very apparent, or the pupils of both eyes much dilated, it is generally fatal. As by &s;timulating one branch of lymphatics into inverted motion, another branch is liable to ab&s;orb its fluid more ha&s;tily; &s;uppo&s;e &s;trong errhines, as common tobacco &s;nuff to children, or one grain of turpeth mineral, (Hydrargyrus vitriolatus), mixed with ten or fifteen grains of &s;ugar, was gradually blown up the no&s;trils? See Cla&s;s I. 3. 2. 1. I have tried common &s;nuff upon two children in this di&s;ea&s;e; one could not be made to &s;neeze, and the other was too near death to receive advan|tage. When the mercurial preparations have produced &s;alivation, I believe they may have been of &s;ervice, but I doubt their good effect otherwi&s;e. In one child I tried the tincture of Digitalis; but it was given with too timid a hand, and too late in the di&s;ea&s;e, to determine its effects. See Sect. XXIX. 5. 9.</P>
<P>As all the above remedies generally fail of &s;ucce&s;s, I think frequent, almo&s;t hourly, &s;hocks of electricity from very &s;mall charges might be pa&s;&s;ed through the head in all directions with probability of good event. And the u&s;e of the tr$phine, where the affected &s;ide can be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. See Strabi&s;mus, Cla&s;s I. 2. 5. 4. When one eye is affect|ed, does the di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;t in the ventricule of that &s;ide?</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>A&s;cites.</HI> The drop&s;y of the cavity of the abdomen is known by a ten&s;e &s;welling of the belly; which does not &s;ound on being &s;truck like the tympany; and in which a fluctuation can be readily perceived by applying one hand expanded on one &s;ide, and &s;triking the tumour on the other.</P>
<P>Effu&s;ions of water into large cavities, as into that of the abdo|men or thorax, or into the ventricules of the brain or pericardium, are more difficult to be reab&s;orbed, than the effu&s;ion of fluids into the cel|lular membrane; becau&s;e one part of this exten&s;ive &s;ponge-like &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="106" REF="1170">
of cells, which connects all the &s;olid parts of the body, may have its power of ab&s;orption impaired, at the &s;ame time that &s;ome other part of it may &s;till retain that power, or perhaps po&s;&s;e&s;s it in an in|crea&s;ed degree; and as all the&s;e cells communicate with each other, the fluid, which abounds in one part of it, can be transferred to an|other, and thus be reab&s;orbed into the circulation.</P>
<P>In the a&s;cites, cream of tartar has &s;ometimes been attended with &s;ucce&s;s; a dram or two drams are given every hour in a morning till it operates, and is to be repeated for &s;everal days; but the operation of tapping is generally applied to at la&s;t. Dr. Sims, in the Memoirs of the Medical Society of London, Vol. III. has lately propo&s;ed, what he believes to be a more &s;ucce&s;sful method of performing this opera|tion, by making a puncture with a lancet in the &s;car of the navel, and leaving it to di&s;charge it&s;elf gradually for &s;everal days, without in|troducing a canula, which he thinks injurious both on account of the too &s;udden emi&s;&s;ion of the fluid, and the danger of wounding or &s;ti|mulating the vi&s;cera. This operation I have twice known performed with le&s;s inconvenience, and I believe with more benefit to the patient, than the common method.</P>
<P>After the patient has been tapped, &s;ome have tried injections into the cavity of the abdomen, but hitherto I believe with ill event. Nor are experiments of this kind very promi&s;ing of &s;ucce&s;s. Fir&s;t becau&s;e the patients are generally much debilitated, mo&s;t frequently by &s;piritu|ous potation, and have generally a di&s;ea&s;e of the liver, or of other vi&s;|cera. And &s;econdly, becau&s;e the quantity of inflammation, nece&s;&s;ary to prevent future &s;ecretion of mucus into the cavity of the abdomen, by uniting the peritoneum with the inte&s;tines or me&s;entery, as hap|pens in the cure of the hydroc$le, would I &s;uppo&s;e generally de&s;troy the patient, either immediately, or by the con&s;equence of &s;uch ad|he&s;ions.</P>
<P>This however is not the $a&s;e in re&s;pect to the drop&s;y of the ovari|um, or in the hydrocele.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="107" REF="1180">
14. <HI>Hydrops thoracis.</HI> The drop&s;y of the che&s;t commences with lo&s;s of fle&s;h, cold extremities, pale countenance, high coloured urine in &s;mall quantity, and general debility, like many other drop&s;ies. The patient next complains of numbne&s;s in the arms, e&s;pecially when ele|vated, with pain and difficulty of &s;wallowing, and an ab&s;olute im|po&s;&s;ibility of lying down for a few minutes, or with &s;udden &s;tarting from &s;leep, with great difficulty of breathing and palpitation of his heart.</P>
<P>The numbne&s;s of the arms is probably owing more frequently to the increa&s;ed action of the pectoral mu&s;cles in re&s;piration, whence they are le&s;s at liberty to perform other offices, than to the connexion of nerves mentioned in Sect. XXIX. 5. 2. The difficulty of &s;wal|lowing is owing to the compre&s;&s;ion of the oe&s;ophagus by the lymph in the che&s;t; and the impo&s;&s;ibility of breathing in an horizontal po&s;|ture originates from this, that if any parts of the lungs mu&s;t be ren|dered u&s;ele&s;s, the inability of the extremities of them mu&s;t be le&s;s in|convenient to re&s;piration; &s;ince if the upper parts or larger trunks of the air-ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be rendered u&s;ele&s;s by the compre&s;&s;ion of the ac|cumulated lymph, the air could not gain admittance to the other parts, and the animal mu&s;t immediately peri&s;h.</P>
<P>If the pericardium is the principal &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, the pul&s;e is quick and irreg$lar. If only the cavity of the thorax is hydropic, the pul&s;e is not quick nor irregular.</P>
<P>If one &s;ide is more affected than the other, the patient leans mo&s;t that way, and has more numbne&s;s in that arm.</P>
<P>The hydrops thoracis is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ana&s;arca pulmonum, as the patient in the former cannot lie down half a minute; in the latter the difficulty of breathing, which occa&s;ions him to ri&s;e up, comes on more gradually; as the tran&s;ition of the lymph in the cellular membranes from one part to another of it is &s;lower, than that of the effu&s;ed lymph in the cavity of the che&s;t.</P>
<P>The hydrops thoracis is often complicated with &s;its of convul&s;ive
<PB N="108" REF="1190">
breathing; and then it produces a di&s;ea&s;e for the time very &s;imilar to the common periodic a&s;thma, which is perhaps owing to a temporary ana&s;arca of the lungs; or to an impaired venous ab&s;orption in them. The&s;e exacerbations of difficult breathing are attended with cold extremities, cold breath, cold tongue, upright po&s;ture with the mouth open, and a de&s;ire of cold air, and a quick, weak, intermittent pul&s;e, and contracted hands.</P>
<P>The&s;e exacerbations recur &s;ometimes every two or three hours, and are relieved by opium, a grain every hour for two or three do&s;es, with ether about a dram in cold water; and &s;eem to be a convul&s;ion of the mu&s;cles of re&s;piration induced by the pain of the dy&s;pnea. As in Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. 9.</P>

<P>Can the fluctuation in the che&s;t be heard by applying the ear to the &s;ide, as Hippocrates a&s;&s;erts? Can it be felt by the hand or by the patient before the di&s;ea&s;e is too great to admit of cure by the paracen|te&s;is? Does this drop&s;y of the che&s;t often come on after peripneu|mony? Is it ever cured by making the patient &s;ick by tincture of digitalis? Could it be cured, if on one &s;ide only, by the operation of puncture between the ribs, and afterwards by inflaming the cavity by the admi&s;&s;ion of air for a time, like the cure of the hydrocele; the pleura afterwards adhering wholly to that lobe of the lungs, &s;o as to prevent any future effu&s;ion of mucus?</P>

It affects women of all ages, either married or virgins; and is pro|duced by cold, fear, hunger, bad food, and other debilitating cau&s;es. I &s;aw an elegant young lady, who was &s;hortly to have been married to a &s;en&s;ible man, with great pro&s;pect of happine&s;s; who, on being overturned in a chai&s;e in the night, and obliged to walk two or three miles in wet, cold, and darkne&s;s, became much indi&s;po&s;ed, and gra|dually afflicted with a &s;welling and pain on one &s;ide of the abdomen; which terminated in a drop&s;y of the ovary, and de&s;troyed her in two or three years. Another young woman I recollect &s;eeing, who was about &s;eventeen, and being of the very inferior cla&s;s of people, &s;eemed to have been much weakened by the hard&s;hip of a cold floor, and little or no bed, with bad food; and who to the&s;e evils had to bear the uncea&s;ing obloquy of her neighbours, and the per&s;ecution of pari&s;h officers.</P>
<P>The following is ab&s;tracted from a letter of my friend Mr. Power, &s;urgeon, at Bo&s;worth in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, on examining the body of an elderly lady who died of this di&s;ea&s;e, March 29, 1793. "On open|ing the abdomen I found a large cy&s;t attached to the left ovarium by an ela&s;tic neck as thick as the little finger, and &s;o callous as not to admit of being &s;eparated by &s;ci&s;&s;ars without con&s;iderable difficulty. The &s;ub&s;tance of the cy&s;t had an appearance much re&s;embling the gravid uterus near the full period of ge&s;tation, and was as thick. It had no attachment to the peritonaeum, or any of the vi&s;cera, except by the hard callous neck I have mentioned; &s;o that the blood mu&s;t with difficulty have been circulated through it for &s;ome time. Its texture was extremely tender, being ea&s;ily perforated with the finger, was of a livid red colour, and evidently in a &s;phacelated &s;tate. It con|tained about two gallons of a fluid of the colour of port wine, with|out any greater tenacity. It has fallen to my lot to have opened two other patients, who&s;e deaths were occa&s;ioned by incy&s;ted drop&s;y of the ovarium. In one of the&s;e the ovarium was much enlarged with eight or ten $y&s;ts on its &s;urface, but there was no adhe&s;ion formed by
<PB N="110" REF="1210">
any of the cy&s;ts to any other part; nor had the ovarium formed any adhe&s;ion with the peritonaeum, though in a very di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate. In the other the di&s;ea&s;e was more &s;imple, being only one cy&s;t, without any attachment but to the ovarium.</P>
<P>"As the ovarium is a part not nece&s;&s;ary to life, and drop&s;ies of this kind are &s;o generally fatal in the end, I think I &s;hall be induced, notwith&s;tanding the hazard attending wounds, which penetrate the cavity of the abdomen, to propo&s;e the extirpation of the di&s;ea&s;ed part in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, which occurs to me, in which I can with preci&s;ion &s;ay, that the ovarium is the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the patient in other re&s;pects tolerably healthy; as the cavity of the abdomen is often opened in other ca&s;es without bad con&s;equences."</P>
<P>An argument, which might further countenance the operation thus propo&s;ed by Mr. Power, might be taken from the di&s;ea&s;e frequently affecting young per&s;ons; from its being generally in the&s;e &s;ubjects local and primary; and not like the a&s;cites, produced or accompanied with other di&s;ea&s;ed vi&s;cera; and la&s;tly, as it is performed in adult quadrupeds, as old &s;ows, with &s;afety, though by awkward operators.</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Ana&s;arca pulmonum.</HI> The drop&s;y of the cellular membrane of the lungs is u&s;ually connected with that of the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem. As the cells of the whole cellular membrane communicate with each other, the mucaginous fluid, which remains in any part of it for want of due ab&s;orption, &s;inks down to the mo&s;t depending cells; hence the legs &s;well, though the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, the deficiency of ab&s;orption, may be in other parts of the &s;y&s;tem. The lungs how|ever are an exception to this, &s;ince they are &s;u&s;pended in the cavity of the thorax, and have in con&s;equence a depending part of their own.</P>
<P>The ana&s;arca of the lungs is known by the difficulty of re&s;piration accompanied with &s;welled legs, and with a very irregular pul&s;e. This
<PB N="111" REF="1220">
la&s;t circum&s;tance has generally been a&s;cribed to a drop&s;y at the &s;ame time exi&s;ting in the pericardium, but is more probably owing to the difficult pa&s;&s;age of the blood through the lungs; becau&s;e I found on di&s;&s;ection, in one in&s;tance, that the mo&s;t irregular pul&s;e, which I ever attended to, was owing to very exten&s;ive adhe&s;ions of the lungs; in&s;omuch that one lobe intirely adhered to the pleura; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e this kind of drop&s;y of the lungs is &s;o certainly removed for a time along with the ana&s;arca of the limbs by the u&s;e of digitalis.</P>
<P>This medicine, as well as emetic tartar, or &s;quill, when given &s;o as to produce &s;ickne&s;s, or nau&s;ea, or perhaps even without pro|ducing either in any perceptible degree, by affecting the lymphatics of the &s;tomach, &s;o as either to invert their motion, or to weaken them, increa&s;es by rever&s;e &s;ympathy the action, and con&s;equent ab&s;orbent power of the&s;e lymphatics, which open into the cellular membrane. But as tho&s;e medicines &s;eldom &s;ucceed in producing an ab&s;orption of tho&s;e fluids, which &s;tagnate in the larger cavities of the body, as in the abdomen, or che&s;t, and do generally &s;ucceed in this difficulty of breathing with irregular pul&s;e above de&s;cribed, I conclude that it is not owing to an effu&s;ion of lymph into the pericardium, but &s;imply to an ana&s;arca of the lungs.</P>

<P N="17">17. <HI>Obe&s;itas.</HI> Corpulency may be called an ana&s;arca or drop&s;y of fat, &s;ince it mu&s;t be owing to an analogous cau&s;e; that is, to the de|ficient ab&s;orption of fat compared to the quantity &s;ecreted into the cells which contain it. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 4.</P>
<P>The method of getting free from too much fat without any injury to the con&s;titution, con&s;i&s;ts, fir&s;t, in putting on a proper bandage on the belly, &s;o that it can be tightened or relaxed with ea&s;e, as a tighti&s;h under wai&s;tcoat, with a double row of buttons. This is to compre&s;s the bowels and increa&s;e their ab&s;orption, and it thus removes one prin|cipal cau&s;e of corpulency, which is the loo&s;ene&s;s of the &s;kin. Secondly, he &s;hould omit one entire meal, as &s;upper; by this long ab&s;tinence from food the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem will act on the mucus and fat with greater energy. Thirdly, he &s;hould drink as little as he can with ea&s;e to his &s;en&s;ations; &s;ince, if the ab&s;orbents of the &s;tomach and bowels &s;upply the blood with much, or perhaps too much, aqueous fluid, the ab&s;orbents of the cellular membrane will act with le&s;s energy. Fourthly, he &s;hould u&s;e much &s;alt or &s;alted meat, which will increa&s;e the per&s;piration and make him thir&s;ty; and if he bears this thir&s;t, the ab&s;orption of his fat will be greatly increa&s;ed, as ap|pears in fevers and drop&s;ies with thir&s;t; this I believe to be more effi|cacious than &s;oap. Fifthly, he may u&s;e aerated alcaline water for his drink, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to render the fat more fluid,&mdash;or he may take &s;oap in large quantities, which will be decompo&s;ed in the &s;tomach.

called Ague-cakes, and &s;eem owing to a deficiency of ab&s;orption in the affected part.</P>
<P>Mr. Y&mdash;, a young man about twenty-five years of age, who lived intemperately, was &s;eized with an ob&s;tinate intermittent, which had become a continued fever with &s;trong pul&s;e, attended with daily remi&s;&s;ion. A large hard tumour on the left &s;ide, on the region of the &s;pleen, but extending much more downward, was &s;o di&s;tinctly percepti|ble, that one &s;eemed to get one's fingers under the edge of it, much like the feel of the brawn or &s;hield on a boar's &s;houlder. He was repeat|edly bled, and purged with calomel, had an emetic, and a bli&s;ter on the part, without dimini&s;hing the tumour; after &s;ome time he took the Peruvian bark, and &s;light do&s;es of chalybeates, and thus became free from the fever, and went to Bath for feveral weeks, but the tumour remained. This tumour I examined every four or five years for above thirty years. His countenance was pale, and towards the end of his life he &s;uffered much from ulcers on his legs, and died about &s;ixty, of general debility; like many others, who live intemperately in re&s;pect to the ingurgitation of fermented or &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P>As this tumour commenced in the cold fit of an intermittent fever, and was not attended with pain, and continued &s;o long without en|dangering his life, there is rea&s;on to believe it was &s;imply occa&s;ioned by deficient ab&s;orption, and not by more energetic action of the ve&s;|&s;els which con&s;titute the &s;pleen. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 13.</P>

The inferior people of Derby are much &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e, but whether more &s;o than other populous towns, I can not determine; certain it is, that they chiefly drink the water of the Der|went, which ari&s;es in a mountainous country, and is very fre|quently blackened as it pa&s;&s;es through the mora&s;&s;es near its &s;ource; and is generally of a darker colour, and attended with a whiter foam, than the Trent, into which it falls; the greater quantity and whitene&s;s of its froth I &s;uppo&s;e may be owing to the vi&s;cidity communicated to it by the colouring matter. The lower parts of the town of Derby might be ea&s;ily &s;upplied with &s;pring water from St. Alkmond's well; or the whole of it from the abundant &s;prings near Bowbridge: the water from which might be conveyed to the town in hol|low bricks, or clay-pipes, at no very great expence, and might be received into frequent re&s;ervoirs with pumps to them; or laid into the hou&s;es.</P>

<P>I have directed in the early &s;tate of this di&s;ea&s;e a mixture of common &s;alt and water to be held in the mouth, particularly under the tongue, for a few minutes, four or &s;ix times a day for many weeks, which has &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded, the &s;alt and water is then &s;pit out again, or in part &s;wallowed. Externally vinegar of &s;quills has been applied, or a mercurial pla&s;ter, or fomentations of acetated ammoniac; or ether. Some empirics have applied cau&s;tics on the bronchocele, and &s;ome|times, I have been told, with &s;ucce&s;s; which &s;hould certainly be u&s;ed where there is danger of &s;uffocation from the bulk of it. One ca&s;e I &s;aw, and one I was well informed of, where the bronchocele was cured by burnt &s;ponge, and a hectic fever &s;upervened with colli|quative &s;weats; but I do not know the final event of either of them.</P>
<P>De Haen affirms the cure of bronchocele to be effected by flowers of zinc, calcined egg-&s;hells, and &s;carlet cloth burnt together in a clo&s;e crucible, which was tried with &s;ucce&s;s, as he a&s;&s;ured me, by a late lamented phy&s;ician, my friend, Dr. Small of Birmingham; who to the cultivation of modern &s;ciences added the integrity of an|cient manners; who in clearne&s;s of head, and benevolence of heart, had few equals, perhaps no &s;uperiors.</P>

inflammation of tho&s;e lymphatic glands, where they fir&s;t ar|rive, as in the axilla and groin. There is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the ton&s;ils frequently become inflamed, and &s;uppurate from the matter ab|&s;orbed from carious teeth; and I &s;aw a young lady, who had both the axillary glands fwelled, and which &s;uppurated; which was believed to have been cau&s;ed by her wearing a pair of new green gloves for one day, when &s;he had per&s;pired much, and was much exhau&s;ted and fatigued by walking; the gloves were probably dyed in a &s;olution of verditer.</P>
<P>The&s;e indolent tumours of the lymphatic glands, which con&s;titute the &s;crophula, originate from the inirritability of tho&s;e glands; which therefore &s;ooner fall into torpor after having been &s;timulated too vio|lently by &s;ome poi&s;onous material; as the mu&s;cles of enfeebled people &s;ooner become fatigued, and cea&s;e to act, when exerted, than tho&s;e of &s;tronger ones. On the &s;ame account the&s;e &s;crophulous glands are much longer in acquiring increa&s;e of motion, after having been &s;timu|lated into inactivity, and either remain years in a &s;tate of indolence, or &s;uppurate with difficulty, and &s;ometimes only partially.</P>
<P>The difference between &s;crophulous tumours, and tho&s;e before de|&s;cribed, con&s;i&s;ts in this; that in tho&s;e either glands of different kinds were di&s;ea&s;ed, or the mouths only of the lymphatic glands were become torpid; whereas in &s;crophula the conglobate glands them&s;elves become tumid, and generally &s;uppurate after a great length of time, when they acquire new &s;en&s;ibility. See Sect. XXXIX. 4. 5.</P>
<P>The&s;e indolent tumours may be brought to &s;uppurate &s;ometimes by pa&s;&s;ing electric &s;hocks through them every day for two or three weeks, as I have witne&s;&s;ed. It is probable, that the alternate appli|cation of &s;now or iced water to them, till they become painfully cold, and then of warm flannel or warm water, frequently repeated, might re&s;tore their irritability by accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power; and thence either facilitate their di&s;per&s;ion, or occa&s;ion them to &s;uppurate.

<P>MANY of the di&s;ea&s;es of this genus are attended with pain, and with cold extremities, both which cea&s;e on the exhibition of wine or opium; which &s;hews, that they originate from deficient action of the affected organ. The&s;e pains are called nervous or &s;pa&s;modic, are not attended with fever, but are frequently &s;ucceeded by convul&s;ions and madne&s;s; both which belong to the cla&s;s of volition. Some of them return at periods, and when the&s;e can be a&s;certained, a much le&s;s quantity of opium will prevent them, than is nece&s;&s;ary to cure them, when they are begun; as the ve&s;&s;els are then torpid and inirritable from the want of &s;en&s;orial power, till by their inaction it becomes again accumulated.</P>
<P>Our organs of &s;en&s;e properly &s;o called are not liable to pain from the ab&s;ence of their appropriated &s;timuli, as from darkne&s;s or &s;ilence; but the other &s;en&s;es, which may be more properly called appetites, as tho&s;e by which we perceive heat, hunger, thir&s;t, lu&s;t, want of fre&s;h air, are affected with pain from the defect or ab&s;ence of their accu&s;tomed &s;timuli, as well as with plea&s;ure by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; it is probable that &s;ome of our glands, who&s;e &s;en&s;e or appetite requires or receives &s;omething from the circulating blood, as the pancreas, liver, te&s;tes, pro&s;tate gland, may be affected with aching or pain, when they cannot acquire their appropriated fluid.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="1340">
Wherever this defect of &s;timulus occurs, a torpor or inaction of the organ en&s;ues, as in the capillaries of the &s;kin, when expo&s;ed to cold; and in the glands, which &s;ecrete the ga&s;tric juice, when we are hungry. This torpor however, and concomitant pain, which is at fir&s;t owing to defect of &s;timulus, is afterwards induced by other a&s;&s;o|ciations or catenations, and con&s;titutes the beginning of ague fits.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be further ob&s;erved, that in the di&s;ea&s;es of pain without fever, the pain is frequently not felt in the part where the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e re&s;ides; but is induced by &s;ympathy with a di&s;tant part, who&s;e irritability or &s;en&s;ibility is greater or le&s;s than its own. Thus a &s;tone at the neck of the bladder, if its &s;timulus is not very great, only induces the pain of &s;trangury at the glans penis. If its &s;timulus be greater, it then induces pain at the neck of the bladder. The concretions of bile, which are protruded into the neck of the gall|bladder, when the di&s;ea&s;e is not very great, produce pain at the other extremity of the bile-duct, which enters the duodenum immediately under the pit of the &s;tomach; but, when the di&s;ea&s;e is great from the largene&s;s of the bile-&s;tone, the pain is felt in the region of the liver at the neck of the gall-bladder.</P>
<P>It appears from hence, that the pains enumerated in this genus are con&s;equences of the inactivity of the organ; and, as they do not oc|ca&s;ion other di&s;ea&s;es, &s;hould be cla&s;&s;ed according to their proximate cau&s;e, which is defective irritation; there are neverthele&s;s other pains from defect of &s;timulus, which produce convul&s;ions, and belong to Cla&s;s III. 1. 1.; and others, which produce pains of &s;ome di&s;tant part by a&s;&s;ociation, and belong to Cla&s;s IV. 2. 2.</P>

<P>The membrane of the upper end of the gullet becomes torpid, and con&s;equently painful, when there is a deficiency of aqueous fluid in the general &s;y&s;tem; it then wants its proper &s;timulus. In the &s;$me manner a want of the &s;timulus of more &s;olid materials at the other end of the canal, which terminates in the &s;tomach, produces hunger; as mentioned in Sect. XIV. 8. The proximate cau&s;es of both of them therefore con&s;i&s;t in deficient irritation, when they are con&s;idered as pains; becau&s;e the&s;e pains are in con&s;equence of the inactivity of the organ, according to the fifth law of animal cau&s;ation. Sect. IV. 5. But when they are con&s;idered as de&s;ires, namely of liquid or &s;olid ali|ment, their proximate cau&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in the pain of them, according to the &s;ixth law of animal cau&s;ation. So the proximate cau&s;e of the pain of coldne&s;s is the inactivity of the organ, and perhaps the con&s;equent accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in it; but the pain it&s;elf, or the con|&s;equent volition, is the proximate cau&s;e of the &s;huddering and gna&s;h|ing the teeth in cold fits of intermittent fevers. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 1.</P>
<P>Thir&s;t may be divided into two varieties alluding to the remote cau&s;e of each, and may be termed &s;itis calida, or warm thir&s;t, and &s;itis frigida, or cold thir&s;t. The remote cau&s;e of the former ari&s;es from the di&s;&s;ipation of the aqueous parts of our fluids by the increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of per&s;pirable matter, or other evacuations. And hence it occurs in hot fits of fever, and after taking much wine, opium, &s;pice, &s;alt, or other drugs of the Art. incitantia or &s;ecernentia. The thir&s;t, which occurs about three hours after eating a couple of red herrings, to a per&s;on unaccu&s;tomed to &s;alted meat, is of this kind; the increa&s;ed action of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els di&s;&s;ipates &s;o much of ou$

<P>M. M. Cold water. Vegetable acids. Warm bath.</P>
<P>The remote cau&s;e of &s;itis frigida, or cold thir&s;t, is owing to the in|action of the cutaneous, pulmonary, urinary, and cellular ab&s;orbents; whence the blood is deprived of the great &s;upply of moi&s;ture, which it ought to receive from the atmo&s;phere, and from the cells of the cellular membrane, and from other cy&s;ts; this cau&s;e of thir&s;t exi&s;ts in drop&s;ies, and in the cold fits of intermittents. The de&s;ire of fluids, like that of &s;olids, is liable to acquire periods, and may therefore readily become di&s;ea&s;ed by indulgence in liquids grateful to the palate.</P>
<P>Of di&s;ea&s;ed thir&s;t, the mo&s;t common is either owing to defect of the action of the numerous ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els on the neck of the blad|der, in which the patient makes much palei&s;h water; or to the de|fective ab&s;orption of the &s;kin and lungs, in which the patient makes but little water, and that high-coloured, and with &s;ediment.

<P N="2">2. <HI>E&s;uries.</HI> Hunger has been fancifully a&s;cribed to the &s;ides of the &s;tomach rubbing again&s;t each other, and to the increa&s;ed acidity of the ga&s;tric juice corroding the coats of it. If either of the&s;e were the cau&s;e of hunger, inflammation mu&s;t occur, when they had continued &s;ome time; but, on the contrary, coldne&s;s and not heat are attendant on hunger; which evinces, that like thir&s;t it is owing to the inac|tivity of the membrane, which is the &s;eat of it; while the abundant nerves about the cardia ventriculi, and the pain of hunger being
<PB N="126" REF="1370">
felt in that part, gives great rea&s;on to conclude, that it is there &s;ituated.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of hunger as well as of thir&s;t is liable to acquire habits in re&s;pect to the times of its returning painfulne&s;s, as well as in re|&s;pect to the quantity required to &s;atiate its appetency, and hence may become di&s;ea&s;ed by indulgence, as well as by want of its appropriate &s;timulus. Tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to di&s;tend their &s;tomach by large quantities of animal and vegetable food, and much potation, find a want of di&s;tention, when the &s;tomach is empty, which occa|&s;ions faintne&s;s, and is mi&s;taken for hunger, but which does not ap|pear to be the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation. I was well informed, that a woman near Lichfield, who eat much animal and vegetable food for a wager, affirmed, that &s;ince di&s;tending her &s;tomach &s;o much, &s;he had never felt her&s;elf &s;atisfied with food; and had in general taken twice as much at a meal, as &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to, before &s;he eat &s;o much for a wager.</P>

1. 3. It con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;tate between the u&s;ual peri&s;talic motions of that organ, in the dige&s;tion of our aliment, and the retrograde mo|tions of it in vomiting; for it is evident, that the direct motions of it from the cardia to the pylorus mu&s;t &s;top, before tho&s;e in a contrary direction can commence. This &s;ickne&s;s, like the nau&s;ea above de|&s;cribed, is &s;ometimes produced by di&s;gu&s;tful ideas, as when na&s;ty ob|jects are &s;een, and na&s;ty &s;tories related, as well as by the exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power by the &s;timulus of &s;ome emetic drugs, and by the defect of the production of it, as in enfeebled drunkards.</P>

<P N="5">5. <HI>Cardialgia.</HI> Heartburn originates from the inactivity of the &s;tomach, whence the aliment, in&s;tead of being &s;ubdued by dige&s;tion, and converted into chyle, runs into fermentation, producing acetous acid. Sometimes the ga&s;tric juice it&s;elf becomes &s;o acid as to give pain to the upper orifice of the &s;tomach; the&s;e acid contents of the &s;tomach, on falling on a marble hearth, have been &s;een to produce an efferve&s;cence on it. The pain of heat at the upper end of the gullet, when any air is brought up from the &s;ermenting contents of the &s;tomach, is to be a&s;cribed to the &s;ympathy between the&s;e two extre|mities of the oe&s;ophagus rather than to the pungency of the carbonic gas, or fixed air; as the &s;en&s;ation in &s;wallowing that kind of air in water is of a different kind.

M. M. This di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;ing from indige&s;tion is often very pertina|cious, and afflicting; and attended with emaciation of the body from want of &s;ufficient chyle. As the &s;aliva &s;wallowed along with our food prevents its fermentation, as appears by the experiments of Pringle and Macbride, &s;ome find con&s;iderable relief by chewing parched wheat, or ma&s;tic, or a lock of wool, frequently in a day, when the pain occurs, and by &s;wallowing the &s;aliva thus effu&s;ed; a temporary relief is often obtained from antiacids, as aerated alcaline water, Seltzer's water, calcareous earths, alcaline &s;alts made into pills with &s;oap, &s;oap alone, tin, milk, bitters. More permanent u&s;e may be had from &s;uch drugs as check fermentation, as acid of vitriol; but &s;till more permanent relief from &s;uch things as invigorate the di|ge&s;tion, as a bli&s;ter on the back; a due quantity of vinous &s;pirit and water taken regularly.

But when the patient is &s;eized with great pain at the &s;tomach with the &s;en&s;ation of coldne&s;s, which they have called an ice-bolt, this is a primary affection of the &s;tomach, and de&s;troys the patient in a few hours, owing to the torpor or inaction of that vi&s;cus &s;o important to life.</P>

<P N="7">7. <HI>Colica flatulenta.</HI> The flatulent colic ari&s;es from the too great di&s;tention of the bowel by air, and con&s;equent pain. The cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e is the inactivity or want of &s;ufficiently powerful contrac|tion of the coats of the bowel, to carry forwards the gas given up by the fermenting aliment. It is without fever, and generally attended with cold extremities.</P>
<P>It is di&s;tingui&s;hed, fir&s;t, from the pain occa&s;ioned by the pa&s;&s;age of a gall-&s;tone, as that is felt at the pit of the &s;tomach, and this nearer the navel. Secondly, it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the colica &s;aturnina, or colic from lead, as that ari&s;ing from the torpor of the liver, or of &s;ome other vi&s;cus, is attended with greater coldne&s;s, and with an aching pain; whereas the flatulent cholic being owing to di&s;tention of the mu&s;cles of the bowel, the pain is more acute, and the coldne&s;s le&s;s. Thirdly, it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from inflammation of the bowels, or ileus, as perpetual vomiting and fever attend this. Fourthly, it is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from cholera, becau&s;e that is accompanied with both vomiting and diarrhoea.

It terminates in paraly&s;is, frequently of the mu&s;cles of the arm, &s;o that the hand hangs down, when the arm is extended horizontally. It is not attended with fever, or increa&s;e of heat. The &s;eat of the di&s;|ea&s;e is not well a&s;certained, it probably affects &s;ome part of the liver, as a pale blui&s;h countenance and deficiency of bile &s;ometimes attends or &s;ucceeds it, with con&s;equent ana&s;arca; but it &s;eems to be cau&s;ed immediately by a torpor of the inte&s;tine, whether this be a primary or &s;econdary affection, as appears from the con&s;tipation of the bowels, which attends it; and is always produced in con&s;equence of the great &s;timulus of lead previou&s;ly u&s;ed either internally for a length of time, or externally on a large &s;urface.</P>
<P>A delicate young girl, daughter of a dairy farmer, who kept his milk in leaden ci&s;terns, u&s;ed to wipe off the cream from the edges of the lead with her finger; and frequently, as &s;he was fond of cream, licked it from her finger.

<P>M. M. In the former ca&s;e a cly&s;ter-pipe unarmed may be intro|duced, and left &s;ome time in the rectum, to take off the re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;phincter, and thus di&s;charge the air, as it is produced from the fermenting or putrefying aliment.

<P>Fir&s;t, becau&s;e the pain precedes the decay of the tooth in regard to time, and is liable to recur, frequently for years, without certainly being &s;ucceeded at la&s;t by a carious tooth, as I have repeatedly ob|&s;erved.</P>
<P>Secondly, becau&s;e any &s;timulant drug, as pyrethrum, or oil of cloves, applied to the tooth, or ether applied externally to the cheek, &s;o far from increa&s;ing the pain, as they would do if the pained mem|brane, already acted too &s;trongly, that they frequently give imme|diate relief like a charm.</P>
<P>And thirdly, becau&s;e the torpor, or deficient action of the mem|brane, which includes the di&s;ea&s;ed tooth, occa&s;ions the motions of the membranes mo&s;t connected with it, as tho&s;e of the cheek and tem|ples, to act with le&s;s than their natural energy; and hence a coldne&s;s of the cheek is perceived ea&s;ily by the hand of the patient, comparing it with the other cheek; and the pain of hemicrania is often produced in the temple of the affected &s;ide.</P>
<P>This coldne&s;s of the cheek in common tooth-ach evinces, that the pain is not then cau&s;ed by inflammation; becau&s;e in all inflammations &s;o much heat is produced in the &s;ecretions of new ve&s;&s;els and fluids, as to give heat to the parts in vicinity. And hence, as &s;oon as the gum &s;wells and inflames along with the cheek, heat is produced, and the pain cea&s;es, owing to the increa&s;ed exortions of the torpid mem|brane, excited by the activity of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation; which previou&s;ly exi&s;ted in its pa&s;&s;ive &s;tate in the painful torpid mem|brane. See Odontitis, Cla&s;s II. 1. 4. 7. and IV. 2. 2. 8.</P>

M. M. If the painful tooth be found, vene&s;ection. Then a ca|thartic. Afterwards two grains of opium. Camphor and opium, one grain of each held in the mouth; or a drop or two of oil of cloves put on the painful tooth. Ether. If the tooth has a &s;mall hole in it, it &s;hould be widened within by an in&s;trument, and then &s;topped with leaf-gold, or leaf-lead; but &s;hould be extracted, if much decayed. It is probable that half a &s;mall drop of a &s;trong &s;olution of ar&s;enic, put carefully into the hollow of a decayed aching tooth, would de&s;troy the nerve without giving any additional pain; but this experiment requires great caution, le&s;t any of the &s;olution &s;hould touch the tongue or gums.</P>
<P>Much cold or much heat are equally injurious to the teeth, which are endued with a fine &s;en&s;ation of this univer&s;al fluid. The be&s;t me|thod of pre&s;erving them is by the daily u&s;e of a bru&s;h, which is not very hard, with warm water and fine charcoal du&s;t. A lump of charcoal &s;hould be put a &s;econd time into the fire till it is red hot, as &s;oon as it becomes cool the external a&s;hes &s;hould be blown off, and it &s;hould be immediately reduced to fine powder in a mortar, and kept clo&s;e &s;topped in a phial. It takes away the bad &s;mell from decayed teeth, by wa&s;hing the mouth with this powder diffu&s;ed in water im|mediately. The putrid &s;mell of decaying &s;tumps of teeth may be de&s;troyed for a time by wa&s;hing the mouth with a weak &s;olution of alum in water. If the calcareous cru&s;t upon the teeth adheres very firmly, a fine powder of pumice-&s;tone may be u&s;ed occa&s;ionally, or a tooth in&s;trument.</P>
<P>Acid of &s;ea-&s;alt, much diluted, may be u&s;ed; but this very rarely, and with the greate&s;t caution, as in cleaning &s;ea-&s;hells. When the gums are &s;pongy, they &s;hould be frequently pricked with a lancet. Should black &s;pots in teeth be cut out? Does the enamel grow again when it has been perforated or abraded?</P>

13. <HI>Otalgia.</HI> Ear-ach &s;ometimes continues many days without apparent inflammation, and is then frequently removed by filling the ear with laudanum, or with ether; or even with warm oil, or warm water. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 4. 8. This pain of the ear, like hemicrania, is frequently the con&s;equence of a&s;&s;ociation with a di&s;ea&s;ed tooth; in that ca&s;e the ether &s;hould be applied to the cheek over the &s;u&s;pected tooth, or a grain of opium and as much camphor mixed together and applied to the &s;u&s;pected tooth. In this ca&s;e the otalgia belongs to the fourth cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Pleurodyne chronica.</HI> Chronical pain of the &s;ide. Pains of the membranous parts, which are not attended with fever, have acquired the general name of rheumatic; which &s;hould, neverthele&s;s, be re|&s;tricted to tho&s;e pains which exi&s;t only when the parts are in motion, and which have been left after inflammation of them; as de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 12. The pain of the &s;ide here mentioned affects many ladies, and may po&s;&s;ibly have been owing to the pre&s;&s;ure of tight &s;tays, which has weakened the action of the ve&s;&s;els compo&s;ing &s;ome membranous part, as, like the cold head-ach, it is attended with pre|&s;ent debility; in one patient, a boy about ten years old, it was at|tended with daily convul&s;ions, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to have originated from worms. The di&s;ea&s;e is very frequent, and generally with&s;tands the u&s;e of bli&s;ters on the part; but in &s;ome ca&s;es I have known it re|moved by electric &s;hocks repeated every day for a fortnight through the affected &s;ide.</P>
<P>Pains of the &s;ide may be &s;ometimes occa&s;ioned by the adhe&s;ion of the lungs to the pleura, after an inflammation of them; or to the adhe&s;ion of &s;ome abdominal vi&s;cera to their cavity, or to each other; which al&s;o are more liable to affect ladies from the unnatural and un|graceful pre&s;&s;ure of tight &s;tays, or by &s;itting or lying too long in one po&s;ture. But in the&s;e ca&s;es the pain &s;hould be more of the &s;marting, than of the dull kind.</P>

<P N="15">15. <HI>Sciatica frigida.</HI> Cold &s;ciatica. The pain along the cour&s;e of the &s;ciatic nerve, from the hip quite down to the top of the foot, when it is not attended with fever, is improperly termed either rheu|mati&s;m or gout; as it occurs without inflammation, is attended with pain when the limb is at re&s;t; and as the pain attends the cour&s;e of the nerve, and not the cour&s;e of the mu&s;cles, or of the fa&s;cia, which contains them. The theory of Cotunnius, who believed it to be a drop&s;y of the &s;heath of the nerve, which was compre&s;&s;ed by the accumulated fluid, has not been confirmed by di&s;&s;ection. The di&s;|ea&s;e &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of a torpor of this &s;heath of the nerve, and the pain &s;eems to be in con&s;equence of this torpor. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 13.</P>

<P N="16">16. <HI>Lumbago &s;rigida.</HI> Cold lumbago. When no fever or inflam|mation attends this pain of the loins, and the pain exi&s;ts without mo|tion, it belongs to this genus of di&s;ea&s;es, and re&s;embles the pain of the loins in the cold fit of ague. As the&s;e membranes are exten&s;ive, and more ea&s;ily fall into quie&s;cence, either by &s;ympathy, or when they are primarily affected, this di&s;ea&s;e becomes very afflicting, and of great pertinacity.

<P N="19">19. <HI>Ve&s;icae felleae inirritabilitas.</HI> The inirritability of the gall-blad|der probably occa&s;ions one kind of <HI>icterus,</HI> or jaundice; which is ow|ing to whatever ob&s;tructs the pa&s;&s;age of bile into the duodenum. The jaundice of aged people, and which attends &s;ome fevers, is believed to be mo&s;t frequently cau&s;ed by an irritative pal&s;y of the gall-bladder; on which account the bile is not pre&s;&s;ed from the cy&s;t by its contrac|tion, as in a paraly&s;is of the urinary bladder.</P>
<P>A thickening of the coats of the common bile-duct by inflammation or increa&s;ed action of their ve&s;&s;els &s;o as to prevent the pa&s;&s;age of the bile into the inte&s;tine, in the &s;ame manner as the membrane, which
<PB N="139" REF="1500">
lines the no&s;trils, becomes thickened in catarrh &s;o as to prevent the pa&s;&s;age of air through them, is probably another frequent cau&s;e of jaundice, e&s;pecially of children; and generally cea&s;es in about a fort|night, like a common catarrh, without the aid of medicine; which has given ri&s;e to the character, which charms have obtained in &s;ome countries for curing the jaundice of young people.</P>
<P>The &s;pi&s;&s;itude of the bile is another cau&s;e of jaundice, as mentioned in Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 8. This al&s;o in children is a di&s;ea&s;e of little danger, as the gall-ducts are di&s;ten&s;ible, and will the ea&s;ier admit of the exclu|&s;ion of gall-&s;tones; but becomes a more &s;erious di&s;ea&s;e in proportion to the age of the patient, and his habits of life in re&s;pect to &s;pirituous potation.</P>
<P>A fourth cau&s;e of jaundice is the compre&s;&s;ion of the bile-duct by the enlargement of an inflamed or &s;chirrous liver; this attends tho&s;e who have drank much &s;pirituous liquor, and is generally &s;ucceeded by drop&s;y and death.</P>
<P>M. M. Repeated emetics. Mild cathartics. Warm bath. Elec|tricity. Bitters. Then &s;teel; which, when the pain and inflamma|tion is removed by evacuations, acts like a charm in removing the re|mainder of the inflammation, and by promoting the ab&s;orption of the new ve&s;&s;els or fluids; like the application of any acrid eye-water at the end of ophthalmia; and thus the thickened coats of the bile-duct become reduced, or the enlargement of the liver le&s;&s;ened, and a free pa&s;&s;age is again opened for the bile into the inte&s;tine. Ether with yolk of egg is recommended, as having a tendency to di&s;&s;olve in|&s;pi&s;&s;ated bile. And a decoction of madder is recommended for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; becau&s;e the bile of animals, who&s;e food was mixed with madder, was found always in a dilute &s;tate. Aerated alcaline water, or Seltzer's water. Raw cabbage, and other acrid vegetables, as water-cre&s;&s;es, mu&s;tard. Hor&s;es are &s;aid to be &s;ubject to in&s;pi&s;&s;ated bile, with yellow eyes, in the winter &s;ea&s;on, and to get well as &s;oon as they feed on the &s;pring gra&s;s.</P>

The large&s;t bile-&s;tone I have &s;een was from a lady, who had parted with it &s;ome years before, and who had ab&s;tained above ten years from all kinds of vegetable diet to prevent, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, a colic of her &s;tomach, which was probably a pain of the biliary duct; on re|&s;uming the u&s;e of &s;ome vegetable diet, &s;he recovered a better &s;tate of health, and formed no new bilious concretions.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Stultitia inirritabilis.</HI> Folly from inirritability. Dulne&s;s of perception. When the motions of the fibrous extremities of the nerves of &s;en&s;e are too weak to excite &s;en&s;ation with &s;ufficient quick|ne&s;s and vigour. The irritative ideas are neverthele&s;s performed, though perhaps in a feeble manner, as &s;uch people do not run again&s;t a po&s;t, or walk into a well. There are three other kinds of folly; that from deficient &s;en&s;ation, from deficient volition, and from de|ficient a&s;&s;ociation, as will be mentioned in their places. In delirium, reverie, and &s;leep, the power of perception is aboli&s;hed from other cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Vi&s;us imminutus.</HI> Dimini&s;hed vi&s;ion. In our approach to old age our vi&s;ion becomes imperfect, not only from the form of the cor|nea, which becomes le&s;s convex, and from its decrea&s;ed tran&s;parency mentioned in Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 26.; but al&s;o from the decrea&s;ed irritability of the optic nerve. Thus, in the inirritative or nervous fever, the pupil of the eye becomes dilated; which in this, as well as in the drop&s;y of the brain, is generally a fatal &s;ymptom. A part of the cornea as well as a part of the albuginea in the&s;e fevers is frequently &s;een during &s;leep; which is owing to the inirritability of the retina to light, or to the general pare&s;is of mu&s;cular action, and in con&s;equence
<PB N="142" REF="1530">
to the le&s;s contraction of the &s;phincter of the eye, if it may be &s;o called, at that time.</P>

Which &s;eems to have been owing to the want of irritability, or the inaptitude to action, of &s;ome cla&s;&s;es of fibres which compo&s;e the retina. Other permanent defects depend on the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the external organ. Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 14. I. 2. 3. 25. IV. 2. 1. 11.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Mu&s;cae volitantes.</HI> Dark &s;pots appearing before the eyes, and changing their apparent place with the motions of the eyes, are ow|ing to a temporary defect of irritability of tho&s;e parts of the retina, which have been lately expo&s;ed to more luminous objects than the other parts of it, as explained in Sect. XL. 2. Hence dark &s;pots are &s;een on the bed-clothes by patients, when the optic nerve is become le&s;s irritable, as in fevers with great debility; and the patients are perpetually trying to pick them off with their fingers to di&s;cover what they are; for the&s;e parts of the retina of weak people are &s;ooner ex|hau&s;ted by the &s;timulus of bright colours, and are longer in regaining their irritability.</P>
<P>Other kinds of ocular &s;pectra, as the coloured ones, are al&s;o more liable to remain in the eyes of people debilitated by fevers, and to produce various hallucinations of &s;ight. For after the contraction of a mu&s;cle, the fibres of it continue in the la&s;t &s;ituation, till &s;ome an|tagoni&s;t mu&s;cles are exerted to retract them; whence, when any one is much exhau&s;ted by exerci&s;e, or by want of &s;leep, or in fevers, it is ea&s;ier to let the fibres of the retina remain in their la&s;t &s;ituation, after having been &s;timulated into contraction, than to exert any antagoni&s;t fibres to replace them.</P>
<P>As the optic nerves at their entrance into the eyes are each of them as thick as a crow-quill, it appears that a great quantity of &s;en&s;orial
<PB N="143" REF="1540">
power is expended during the day in the perpetual activity of our &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion, be&s;ides that u&s;ed in the motions of the eye-balls and eye|lids; as much I &s;uppo&s;e as is expended in the motions of our arms, which are &s;upplied with nerves of about the &s;ame diameters. From hence we may conclude, that the light &s;hould be kept from patients in fevers with debility, to prevent the unnece&s;&s;ary exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power. And that on the &s;ame account their rooms &s;hould be kept &s;ilent as well as dark; that they &s;hould be at re&s;t in an hori|zontal po&s;ture; and be cooled by a bla&s;t of cool air, or by wa&s;hing them with cold water, whenever their &s;kins are warmer than na|tural.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Strabi&s;mus.</HI> Squinting is generally owing to one eye being le&s;s perfect than the other; on which account the patient endeavours to hide the wor&s;t eye in the &s;hadow of the no&s;e, that his vi&s;ion by the other may not be confu&s;ed. Calves, which have an hydatide with in&s;ects inclo&s;ed in it in the frontal &s;inus on one &s;ide, turn towards the affected &s;ide; becau&s;e the vi&s;ion on that &s;ide, by the pre&s;&s;ure of the hydatide, becomes le&s;s perfect; and the di&s;ea&s;e being recent, the animal turns round, expecting to get a more di&s;tinct view of objects.</P>
<P>In the hydrocephalus internus, where both eyes are not become in&s;en&s;ible, the patient &s;quints with only one eye, and views objects with the other, as in common &s;trabi&s;mus. In this ca&s;e it may be known on which &s;ide the di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ts, and that it does not exi&s;t on both &s;ides of the brain; in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as the patients I be|lieve never recover as they are now treated, might it not be advi&s;e|able to perforate the cranium over the ventricule of the affected &s;ide? which might at lea&s;t give room and &s;timulus to the affected part of the brain?</P>

In fevers of debility without inflammation, called nervous fevers, I &s;u&s;pect deafne&s;s to be a bad &s;ymptom, ari&s;ing like the dilated pupil from a partial paraly&s;is of the nerve of &s;en&s;e. See Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 15.</P>
<P>Nervous fevers are &s;uppo&s;ed by Dr. Gilchri&s;t to originate from a conge&s;tion of &s;erum or water in &s;ome part of the brain, as many of the &s;ymptoms are &s;o &s;imilar to tho&s;e of hydrocephalus internus, in which a fluid is accumulated in the ventricules of the brain; on this idea the inactivity of the optic or auditory nerves in the&s;e fevers may ari&s;e from the compre&s;&s;ion of the effu&s;ed fluid; while the torpor at|tending putrid fever may depend on the meninges of the brain being thickened by inflammation, and thus compre&s;&s;ing it; now the new ve&s;&s;els, or the blood, which thickens inflamed parts, is more fre|quently reab&s;orbed, than the effu&s;ed fluid from a cavity; and hence the &s;tupor in one ca&s;e is le&s;s dangerous than in the other.</P>

9. <HI>Tactus imminutus.</HI> Numbne&s;s is frequently complained of in fevers, and in epilep&s;y, and the touch is &s;ometimes impaired by the dryne&s;s of the cuticle of the fingers. See Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 16.</P>
<P>When the &s;en&s;e of touch is impaired by the compre&s;&s;ion of the nerve, as in &s;itting long with one thigh cro&s;&s;ed over the other, the limb appears larger, when we touch it with our hands, which is to be a&s;cribed to the indi&s;tinctne&s;s of the &s;en&s;ation of touch, and may be explained in the &s;ame manner as the apparent largene&s;s of objects &s;een through a mi&s;t. In this la&s;t ca&s;e the minute parts of an object, as &s;uppo&s;e of a di&s;tant boy, are &s;een le&s;s di&s;tinctly, and therefore we in&s;tantly conceive them to be further from the eye, and in con&s;equence that the whole &s;ubtends a larger angle, and thus we believe the boy to be a man. So when any one's fingers are pre&s;&s;ed on a benumbed limb, the &s;en&s;ation produced is le&s;s than it &s;hould be, judging from vi&s;ible circum&s;tances; we therefore conceive, that &s;omething inter|vened between the object and the &s;en&s;e, for it is felt as if a blanket was put between them; and that not being vi&s;ibly the ca&s;e, we judge that the limb is &s;welled.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of touch is al&s;o liable to be deceived from the acquired habits of one part of it acting in the vicinity of another part of it. Thus if the middle finger be cro&s;&s;ed over either of the fingers next to it, and a nut be felt by the two ends of the fingers &s;o cro&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time, the nut appears as if it was two nuts. And la&s;tly, the &s;en&s;e of touch is liable to be deceived by preconceived ideas; which we believe to be excited by external objects, even when we are awake. It has happened to me more than once, and I &s;uppo&s;e to mo&s;t others, to have put my hands into an empty ba&s;on &s;tanding in an ob&s;cure corner of a room to wa&s;h them, which I believed to contain cold water, and have in&s;tantly perceived a &s;en&s;ation of warmth, con|trary to that which I expected to have felt.</P>
<P>In &s;ome paralytic affections, and in cold fits of ague, the &s;en&s;ation of touch has been much impaired, and yet that of heat has remained. See Sect. XIV. 6.</P>

<P>Dr. Blane in his Croonian Lecture on mu&s;cular motion for 1788, among many other ingenious ob&s;ervations and deductions, relates a curious experiment on &s;almon, and other fi&s;h, and which he repeated upon eels with &s;imilar event.</P>
<P>"If a fi&s;h, immediately upon being taken out of the water, is &s;tun|ned by a violent blow on the head, or by having the head cru&s;hed, the irritability and &s;weetne&s;s of the mu&s;cles will be pre&s;erved much longer, than if it had been allowed to die with the organs of &s;en&s;e en|tire. This is &s;o well known to fi&s;hermen, that they put it in practice, in order to make them longer &s;u&s;ceptible of the operation called <HI>crimping.</HI> A &s;almon is one of the fi&s;h lea&s;t tenacious of life, in&s;omuch, that it will lo&s;e all &s;igns of life in le&s;s than half an hour after it is taken out of the water, if &s;uffered to die without any farther injury; but if, immediately after being caught, it receives a violent blow on the head, the mu&s;cles will &s;hew vi&s;ible irritability for more than twelve hours afterwards."</P>

<P>THE retrograde motions of our &s;y&s;tem originate either from defect of &s;timulus, or from defect of irritability. Thus &s;ickne&s;s is often induced by hunger, which is a want of &s;timulus; and from ipecacu|anha, in which la&s;t ca&s;e it would &s;eem, that the &s;ickne&s;s was induced after the violence of the &s;timulus was abated, and the con&s;equent tor|por had &s;ucceeded.

<P>The globus hy&s;tericus, &s;alivation, diabaetes, and other inver&s;ions of motion attending hy&s;teric paroxy&s;ms, &s;eem to depend on the want of irritability of tho&s;e parts of the body, becau&s;e they are attended with cold extremities, and general debility, and are relieved by wine, opi|um, &s;teel, and fle&s;h diet; that is, by any additional &s;timulus.</P>
<P>When the longitudinal mu&s;cles are fatigued by long action, or are habitually weaker than natural, the antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles replace the limb by &s;tretching it in a contrary direction; and as the&s;e mu&s;cles have had their actions a&s;&s;ociated in &s;ynchronous tribes, their actions cea&s;e together. But as the hollow mu&s;cles propel the fluids, which they con|tain, by motions a&s;&s;ociated in trains; when one ring is fatigued from its too great debility, and brought into retrograde action; the next ring, and the next, from its a&s;&s;ociation in train falls into retrograde action. Which continue &s;o long as they are excited to act, like the tremors of the hands of infirm people, &s;o long as they endeavour to
<PB N="150" REF="1610">
act. Now as the&s;e hollow mu&s;cles are perpetually &s;timulated, the&s;e retrograde actions do not cea&s;e as the tremors of the longitudinal mu&s;cles, which are generally excited only by volition. Whence the retrograde motions of hollow mu&s;cles depend on two circum&s;tances, in which they differ from the longitudinal mu&s;cles, namely, their motions being a&s;&s;ociated in trains, and their being &s;ubject to perpetual &s;timulus. For further elucidation of the cau&s;e of this curious &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;es, &s;ee Sect. XXIX. 11. 5.</P>
<P>The fluids di&s;gorged by the retrograde motions of the various va&s;cu|lar mu&s;cles may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, 1. From tho&s;e, which are pro|duced by &s;ecretion, by their not being attended by increa&s;e of heat, which always accompanies increa&s;ed &s;ecretion. 2. They may be di&s;|tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e fluids, which are the con&s;equence of deficient ab&s;orption, by their not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;aline acrimony, which tho&s;e fluids po&s;&s;e&s;s; which inflames the &s;kin or other membranes on which they fall; and which have a &s;aline ta&s;te to the tongue. 3. They may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e fluids, which are the con&s;equence both of increa&s;ed &s;ecretion and ab&s;orption, as the&s;e are attended with increa&s;e of warmth, and are in&s;pi&s;&s;ated by the ab&s;traction of their aqueous parts. 4. Where chyle, or milk, are found in the feces or urine, or when other fluids, as matter, are tran&s;lated from one part of the &s;y&s;tem to another, they have been the product of retrograde action of lymphatic or other canals.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Ruminatio.</HI> In the rumination of horned cattle the retograde motions of the oe&s;ophagus are vi&s;ible to the eye, as they bring up the &s;oftened gra&s;s from their fir&s;t &s;tomach. The vegetable aliment in the fir&s;t &s;tomach of cattle, which have filled them&s;elves too full of young clover, is liable to run into fermentation, and di&s;tend the &s;tomach,
<PB N="151" REF="1620">
&s;o as to preclude its exit, and frequently to de&s;troy the animal. To di&s;charge this air the farmers frequently make an opening into the &s;tomach of the animal with &s;ucce&s;s. I was informed, I believe by the late Dr. Whytt of Edinburgh, that of twenty cows in this &s;itua|tion two had died, and that he directed a pint of gin or whi&s;ky, mixed with an equal quantity of water, to be given to the other eighteen; all of which eructed immen&s;e quantities of air, and recovered.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Ructus.</HI> Eructation. An inverted motion of the &s;tomach ex|cluding through its upper valve an ela&s;tic vapour generated by the fer|mentation of the aliment; which proceeds &s;o ha&s;tily, that the dige&s;|tive power does not &s;ubdue it. This is &s;ometimes acquired by habit, &s;o that &s;ome people can eruct when they plea&s;e, and as long as they plea&s;e; and there is gas enough generated to &s;upply them for this purpo&s;e; for by Dr. Hale's experiments, an apple, and many other kinds of aliment, give up above &s;ix hundred times their own bulk of an ela&s;tic gas in fermentation. When people voluntarily eject the fix|able air from their &s;tomachs, the fermentation of the aliment pro|ceeds the fa&s;ter; for &s;topping the ve&s;&s;els, which contain new wines, retards their fermentation, and opening them again accelerates it; hence where the dige&s;tion is impaired, and the &s;tomach &s;omewhat di&s;tended with air, it is better to re&s;train than to encourage eructa|tions, except the quantity makes it nece&s;&s;ary. When wine is con|fined in bottles the fermentation &s;till proceeds &s;lowly even for years, till all the &s;ugar is converted into &s;pirit; but in the proce&s;s of di|ge&s;tion, the &s;accharine part is ab&s;orbed in the form of chyle by the bibulous mouths of the numerous lacteals, before it has time to run into the vinous fermentation.</P>

This di&s;ea&s;e is perhaps generally left after a &s;light inflammation of the &s;tomach, called a &s;urfeit, occa&s;ioned by drinking cold liquors, or eating cold vegetables, when heated with exerci&s;e. This inflammation of the &s;tomach is frequently, I believe, at its commencement removed by a critical eruption on the face, which differs in its appearance as well as in its cau&s;e from the gutta ro&s;ea of drunkards, as the &s;kin round the ba&s;e of each eruption is le&s;s inflamed. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 4. 7. This di&s;ea&s;e differs from Cardial|gia, Cla&s;s I. 2. 4. 5. in its being not uniformly attended with pain of the cardia ventriculi, and from its retrograde motions of a part of the &s;tomach about the upper orifice of it. In the &s;ame manner as hy&s;teria differs from hypochondria&s;is; the one con&s;i&s;ting in the weakne&s;s and indige&s;tion of the &s;ame portions of the alimentary canal, and the other in the inverted motions of &s;ome parts of it. This apep&s;ia or water|qualm continues many years, even to old age; Mr. G&mdash;of Lich|field &s;uffered under this di&s;ea&s;e from his infancy; and, as he grew old, found relief only from repeated do&s;es of opium.</P>

Pomme, relieves the&s;e hy&s;teric &s;ymptoms in&s;tantaneou&s;ly like a charm; which it may effect by checking the inverted motions of the inte&s;tinal canal by the torpor occa&s;ioned by cold; or one end of the inte&s;tinal canal may become &s;trengthened, and regain its peri&s;taltic motion by rever&s;e &s;ympathy, when the other end is rendered torpid by ice-water.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Catarrhus lymphaticus.</HI> Lymphatic catarrh. A periodical de|fluxion of a thin fluid from the no&s;trils, for a few hours, occa&s;ioned by the retrograde motions of their lymphatics; which may probably be &s;upplied with fluid by the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of &s;ome other lym|phatic branches in their vicinity. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed from that mucous di&s;charge, which happens in fro&s;ty weather from decrea&s;ed ab&s;orption, becau&s;e it is le&s;s &s;alt to the ta&s;te; and from an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of mucus, becau&s;e it is neither &s;o vi&s;cid, nor is attended with heat of the part. This complaint is liable to recur at diurnal periods, like an intermittent fever, for weeks and months together, with great &s;neez|ing and very copious di&s;charge for an hour or two.</P>
<P>I have &s;een two of the&s;e ca&s;es, both of which occurred in delicate women, and &s;eemed an appendage to other hy&s;teric &s;ymptoms; whence I concluded, that the di&s;charge was occa&s;ioned by the in|verted motions of the lymphatics of the no&s;trils, like the pale urine in hy&s;teric ca&s;es; and that they might receive this fluid from &s;ome other branches of lymphatic ve&s;&s;els opening into the frontal or maxil|lary cavities in their vicinity.</P>
<P>Could &s;uch a di&s;charge be produced by &s;trong errhines, and excite
<PB N="160" REF="1710">
an ab&s;orption of the conge&s;tion of lymph in the drop&s;y of the brain?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Salivatio lymphatica.</HI> Lymphatic &s;alivation. A copious expu|ition of a pellucid in&s;ipid fluid, occa&s;ioned by the retrograde motions of the lymphatics of the mouth. It is &s;ometimes periodical, and of|ten attends the hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e, and nervous fevers; but is not ac|companied with a &s;aline ta&s;te, or with heat of the mouth, or nau&s;ea.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Nau&s;ea humida.</HI> Moi&s;t nau&s;ea con&s;i&s;ts in a di&s;charge of fluid, owing to the retrograde motions of the lymphatics about the fauces, without increa&s;e of heat, or &s;aline ta&s;te, together with &s;ome retro|grade motions of the fauces or pharinx; along with this nau&s;ea a &s;ickne&s;s generally precedes the act of vomiting; which may con&s;i&s;t of a &s;imilar di&s;charge of mucus or chyle into the &s;tomach by the re|trograde motions of the lymphatics or lacteals, which open into it. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 4. 3. and I. 2. 4. 4.</P>
<P>M. M. Subacid liquids. Wine. Opium. A bli&s;ter.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Diarrhoea lymphatica.</HI> Lymphatic diarrhoea. A quantity of mucus and lymph are poured into the inte&s;tines by the inverted mo|tions of the inte&s;tinal lymphatics. The feces are le&s;s fetid and more liquid; and it &s;ometimes portends the commencement of a diabaetes, or drop&s;y, or their temporary relief. This lymphatic diarrhoea &s;ome|times becomes chronical, in which the atmo&s;pheric moi&s;ture, ab|&s;orbed by the cutaneous and pulmonary lymphatics, is poured into the inte&s;tines by the retrograde motions of the lacteals. See Section XXIX. 4. 6. where &s;ome ca&s;es of this kind are related.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Diarrhoea chylifera. caeliaca.</HI> Chyliferous diarrhoea. The chyle drank up by the lacteals of the upper inte&s;tines is poured into
<PB N="161" REF="1720">
the lower ones by the retrograde motions of their lacteals, and appears in the dejections. This circum&s;tance occurs at the beginning of di|arrhoea crapulo&s;a, where the patient has taken and dige&s;ted more ali|ment than the &s;y&s;tem can conveniently receive, and thus eliminates a part of it; as appears when there is curdled chyle in &s;ome of the de|jections. See Sect. XXIX. 4. 7. It differs from the lymphatic diar|rhoea, as the chyliferous diabaetes differs from the aqueous and muca|ginous diabaetes.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Diabaetes.</HI> By the retrograde motions of the urinary lymphatics, an immen&s;e quantity of fluid is poured into the bladder. It is either termed chyliferous, or aqueous, or mucaginous, from the nature of the fluid brought into the bladder; and is either a temporary di&s;ea&s;e, as in hy&s;teric women, in the beginning of intoxication, in worm ca&s;es, or in tho&s;e expo&s;ed to cold damp air, or to great fear, or anxiety, or in the commencement of &s;ome drop&s;ies; or it becomes chronical.</P>
<P>When the urinary lymphatics invert their motions, and pour their refluent contents into the bladder, &s;ome other branch of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem acts with greater energy to &s;upply this fluid. If it is the in|te&s;tinal branch, the chyliferous diabaetes is produced: if it is the cu|taneous or pulmonary branch, the aqueous diabaetes is produced: and if the cellular or cy&s;tic branches, the mucaginous diabaetes. In the two la&s;t the urine is pellucid, and contains no &s;ugar.</P>
<P>In drop&s;ies the fluid is &s;ometimes ab&s;orbed, and poured into the blad|der by the retrograde motions of the urinary lymphatics, as during the exhibition of digitalis. In the beginning of the drop&s;ies of infirm gouty patients, I have frequently ob&s;erved, that they make a large quantity of water for one night, which relieves them for &s;everal days. In the&s;e ca&s;es the patient previou&s;ly feels a fulne&s;s about the precordia, with difficult re&s;piration, and &s;ymptoms &s;imilar to tho&s;e of hy&s;teria. Perhaps a previous defect of ab&s;orption takes place in &s;ome part of
<PB N="162" REF="1730">
the body in tho&s;e hy&s;teric ca&s;es, which are relieved by a copious di&s;|charge of pale urine. See Diabaetes explained at large, Section XXIX. 4.</P>
<P>A di&s;charge of blood &s;ometimes attends the diabaetes, which was occa&s;ionally a &s;ymptom of that di&s;ea&s;e in Mr. Brindley, the great na|vigable canal maker in this country. Which may be accounted for by the communication of a lymphatic branch with the ga&s;tric branch of the vena portarum, as di&s;covered by J. F. Meckel. See Section XXVII. 2.</P>
<P>M. M. Alum. Earth of Alum. Cantharides. Calomel. Bark. Steel. Ro&s;in. Opium. See Sect. XXIX. 4.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Sudor lymphaticus.</HI> Profu&s;e &s;weats from the inverted motions of the cutaneous lymphatics, as in &s;ome fainting fits, and at the ap|proach of death; and as perhaps in the &s;udor anglicanus. See Sect. XXIX. 5. The&s;e &s;weats are glutinous to the touch, and without increa&s;ed heat of the &s;kin; if the part is not covered, the &s;kin becomes cold from the evaporation of the fluid. The&s;e &s;weats without heat &s;ometimes occur in the act of vomiting, as in Sect. XXV. 9. and are probably the cau&s;e of the cold &s;weaty hands of &s;ome people. As men|tioned in Sect. XXIX. 4. 9. in the ca&s;e of R. Davis, whi$h he cured by frequent application of lime. Though it is po&s;&s;ible, that cold &s;weaty hands may al&s;o ari&s;e from the want of due ab&s;orption of the per&s;pirable matter effu&s;ed on them, and that the coldne&s;s may be owing to the greater evaporation in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The acid &s;weats de&s;cribed by Dr. Dob&s;on, which he ob&s;erved in a diabaetic patient, and a&s;cribes to the chyle effu&s;ed on the &s;kin, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the retrograde action of the cutaneous lymphatics. See Sect. XXIX. 6.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Sudor a&s;thmaticus.</HI> The cold &s;weats in this di&s;ea&s;e only cover the head, arms, and brea&s;t, and are frequently exceedingly profu&s;e.
<PB N="163" REF="1740">
The&s;e &s;weats are owing to the inverted motions of the cutaneous lym|phatics of the upper part of the body, and at the &s;ame time the in|crea&s;ed ab&s;orption of the pulmonary ab&s;orbents: hence the&s;e &s;weats when profu&s;e relieve the pre&s;ent fit of a&s;thma. There is no other way to account for &s;weats appearing on the upper parts of the body only, but by the fluid having been ab&s;orbed by the lymphatic branch of the lungs, and effu&s;ed on the &s;kin by the retrograde movements of the cutaneous lymphatics; which join tho&s;e of the lungs before they enter into the venous circulation. For if they were occa&s;ioned, as generally &s;uppo&s;ed, by the difficulty of the circulation of the blood through the lungs, the whole &s;kin mu&s;t be equally affected, both of the upper and lower parts of the body; for whatever could ob&s;truct the circulation in the upper part of the venous &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t equally ob&s;truct it in the lower part of it. See Sect. XXIX. 6. In the con|vul&s;ive a&s;thma the&s;e &s;weats do not occur; hence they may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed; and might be called the hydropic a&s;thma, and the epileptic a&s;thma.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Tran&s;latio puris.</HI> Tran&s;lation of matter from one part of the &s;y&s;tem to another can only be explained from its being ab&s;orbed by one branch of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, and depo&s;ited in a di&s;tant part by the retrograde motions of another branch; as mentioned Sect. XXIX. 7. 1. It is curious, that the&s;e tran&s;lations of matter are attended ge|nerally, I believe, with cold fits; for le&s;s heat is produced during the retrograde action of this part of the &s;y&s;tem, as no &s;ecretion in the lymphatic glands of the affected branches can exi&s;t at the &s;ame time. Do any ineffectual retrograde motions occa&s;ion the cold fits of agues? The time when the gout of the liver cea&s;es, and the gout in the foot commences, is attended with a cold fit, as I have ob&s;erved in two in|&s;tances, which is difficult to explain, without &s;uppo&s;ing the new ve&s;|&s;els, or the matter produced on the inflamed liver, to be ab&s;orbed,
<PB N="164" REF="1750">
and either eliminated by &s;ome retrograde motion, or carried to the newly inflamed part? See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 2. 15.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Tran&s;latio lactis.</HI> Tran&s;lation of milk to the bowels in puer|peral fevers can only be explained by the milk being ab&s;orbed by the pectoral branch of lymphatics, and carried to the bowels by the retro|grade motions of the inte&s;tinal lymphatics or lacteals. See many in|&s;tances of this in Sect. XXIX. 7. 4.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Tran&s;latio urinae.</HI> Tran&s;lation of urine. There is a curious ca&s;e related in the Tran&s;action of the College of Phy&s;icians at Phila|delphia, Vol. I. p. 96. of a girl, who labouring under an i&s;curia vo|mited her urine for many months; which could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed from that which was at other times drawn off by the catheter. After having taken much opium, &s;he &s;eems at length to have formed gravel, &s;ome of which was frequently brought up by vomiting. Dr. Senter a&s;cribes this to the retrograde motions of the lymphatics of the &s;to|mach, and the increa&s;ed ones of tho&s;e of the bladder, and refers to tho&s;e of Sect. XXIX. of this work; which &s;ection was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1780; and to Macquire's Dictionary of Chemi&s;try, Art. Urine.</P>
<P>The patient above de&s;cribed &s;ometimes had a di&s;charge of urine by the navel, and at other times by the rectum, and &s;ometimes by uri|nous &s;weats.</P>

<P>The criterion between the actions, which are the immediate con|&s;equence of painful &s;en&s;ation, and convul&s;ive actions properly &s;o called, con&s;i&s;ts in the former having a tendency to di&s;lodge the &s;timulating cau&s;e, which induces the painful &s;en&s;ation; and the latter being ex|erted for the purpo&s;e of expending the &s;en&s;orial power, and thus dulling or de&s;troying the general &s;en&s;ation of the &s;y&s;tem.

<HEAD>SPECIES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Deglutitio.</HI> Swallowing our food is immediately cau&s;ed by the plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation occa&s;ioned by its &s;timulus on the palate or fauces, and is acquired long before the nativity of the animal. Afterwards the pain of hunger previou&s;ly produces the various voluntary exer|tions to procure the proper material, but the actions of ma&s;ticating and of &s;wallowing it are effected by the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation; which appears by their not being always controulable by the will, as when children in vain attempt to &s;wallow nau&s;eous drugs. See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 3. 1. The ma&s;ticated food &s;timulates the palate, which is an organ of &s;en&s;e, into &s;o much action, as to produce agreeable &s;en&s;ation; and the mu&s;cles &s;ub&s;ervient to deglutition are brought into action by the &s;en&s;ation thus produced. The plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ation is the proxi|mate cau&s;e; the action of the fibres of the extremities of the nerves of ta&s;te is the remote cau&s;e; the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation exciting the&s;e fibres of the nerves of ta&s;te into increa&s;ed action is the pre|remote cau&s;e; the action of the mu&s;cles of deglutition is the proximate effect; the pu&s;hing the food into the &s;tomach is the remote effect; and the nutrition of the body is the po&s;t-remote effect.</P>
<P>Though the mu&s;cles &s;ub&s;ervient to deglutition have their actions previou&s;ly a&s;&s;ociated, &s;o as to be excited into &s;ynchronous tribes or &s;ucce&s;&s;ive trains, either by volition, as when we &s;wallow a di&s;agree|able drug; or by &s;en&s;ation, as when we &s;wallow agreeable food; or by irritation, as when we inattentively &s;wallow our &s;aliva; yet do all tho&s;e three kinds of deglutition belong to the re&s;pective cla&s;&s;es of vo|lition, &s;en&s;ation, and irritation; becau&s;e the fir&s;t links of the&s;e tribes or trains of mu&s;cular action are excited by tho&s;e &s;en&s;orial powers, and the a&s;&s;ociated links, which accompany or &s;ucceed them, are excited by
<PB N="179" REF="1890">
the combined powers either of volition, or of &s;en&s;ation, or of irrita|tion, along with that of a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Re&s;piratio.</HI> Re&s;piration is immediately cau&s;ed by the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation in con&s;equence of the baneful want of vital air; and not from the accumulation of blood in the lungs, as that might be carried on by inhaling azote alone, without the oxygenous part of the atmo&s;phere. The action of re&s;piration is thus &s;imilar to that of &s;wallowing our food to appea&s;e the pain of hunger; but the lungs being &s;urrounded with air, their proper pabulum, no intermediate voluntary exertions are required, as in hunger, to obtain and prepare the wanted material.</P>
<P>Re&s;piration is &s;imilar to &s;low combu&s;tion; the oxygenous part of the atmo&s;phere is received through the moi&s;t membranes, which line the air-cells of the lungs, and uniting with the inflammable part of the blood generates an acid, probably the pho&s;phoric acid; a portion of carbonic acid is likewi&s;e produced in this proce&s;s; as appears by repeatedly breathing over lime-water, which then becomes turbid. See Botanic Garden, P. I. Canto I. l. 401. note.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Sternutatio.</HI> Sneezing con&s;i&s;ts of mu&s;cular actions produced by the &s;en&s;orial faculty of &s;en&s;ation; and is an effort to di&s;lodge, by means of air forcibly impelled through the no&s;trils, &s;ome material; which &s;timulates the membrane, which lines them, into too great action, and might thence injure the &s;en&s;e of &s;mell which is diffu&s;ed on it.</P>
<P>In this operation the too great action of the ve&s;&s;els of the mem|brane of the no&s;trils is the remote cau&s;e; the &s;en&s;ation thence induced is the proximate cau&s;e; and the mu&s;cular actions are the proximate effect.</P>
<P>This action of &s;neezing frequently precedes common re&s;piration in new-born children, but I believe not always; as like the latter it can|not have been previou&s;ly acquired in the uterus.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="1900">
It is produced in &s;ome people by &s;udden light, as by looking up at the &s;ky in a morning, when they come out of a gloomy bed-cham|ber. It then becomes an a&s;&s;ociate action, and belongs to Cla&s;s IV. 1. 2. 2.</P>
<P>M. M. When it is exerted to exce&s;s it may be cured by &s;nuffing &s;tarch up the no&s;trils. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 13.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Anhelitus.</HI> Panting. The quick and laborious breathing of running people, who are not accu&s;tomed to violent exerci&s;e, is occa|&s;ioned by the too great conflux of blood to the lungs. As the &s;angui|ferous &s;y&s;tem, as well as the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, is furni&s;hed in many parts of its cour&s;e with valves, which in general prevent the retro|grade movement of their contained fluids; and as all the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, in &s;ome part of their cour&s;e, lie in contact with the mu&s;cles, which are brought into action in running, it follows that the blood mu&s;t be ac|celerated by the intermitted &s;welling of the bellies of the mu&s;cles moving over them.</P>
<P>The difficulty of breathing, with which very fat people are imme|diately affected on exer$i&s;e, is owing to the pre&s;&s;ure of the accumu|lated fat on the veins, arteries, and lymphatics; and which, by di&s;|tending the &s;kin, occa&s;ions it to act as a tight bandage on the whole &s;urface of the body. Hence when the mu&s;cles are excited into quicker action, the progre&s;s of the blood in the veins, and of the lymph and chyle in the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, is urged on with much greater force, as under an artificial bandage on a limb, explained in Art. IV. 2. 10. and in Sect. XXXIII. 3. 2. Hence the circulation is in&s;tantly quick|ened to a great degree, and the difficulty of breathing is the con&s;e|quence of a more rapid circulation through the lungs. The increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of the per&s;pirable matter is another con&s;equence of this rapid circulation; fat people, when at re&s;t, are believed to per&s;pire le&s;s than others, which may be gathered from their generally having more liquid &s;tools, more and paler urine, and to their frequently taking le&s;s
<PB N="181" REF="1910">
food than many thin people; and la&s;tly, from the per&s;piration of fat people being generally more inodorous than that of lean ones; but when corpulent people are put in motion, the &s;weat &s;tands in drops on their &s;kins, and they "lard the ground" as they run. The in|crea&s;e of heat of corpulent people on exerci&s;e, is another con&s;equence of their more rapid circulation, and greater &s;ecretion. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 17.</P>
<P>Other cau&s;es of difficult or quick re&s;piration will be treated of un|der A&s;thma, Pertu&s;&s;is, Peripneumony, Ton&s;illitis.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Tu&s;&s;is ebriorum.</HI> Sen&s;itive cough is an exertion of the mu&s;cles u&s;ed in expiration excited into more violent action by the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation, in con&s;equence of &s;omething which too power|fully &s;timulates the lungs. As the &s;aline part of the &s;ecreted mucus, when the ab&s;orption of it is impeded; or the too great vi&s;cidity of it, when the ab&s;orption is increa&s;ed; or the too great quantity of the mucus, when the &s;ecretion is increa&s;ed; or the inflammation of the membranes of the lungs; it is an effort to di&s;lodge any of the&s;e extra|neous materials.</P>
<P>Of this kind is the cough which attends free-drinkers after a de|bauch; it con&s;i&s;ts of many &s;hort efforts to cough, with a frequent ex|puition of half a tea-&s;poonful of frothy mucus, and is attended with con&s;iderable thir&s;t. The thir&s;t is occa&s;ioned by the previous di&s;&s;ipa|tion of the aqueous parts of the blood by &s;en&s;ible or in&s;en&s;ible per&s;pira|tion; which was produced by the increa&s;ed action of the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries during the &s;timulus of the wine. In con|&s;equence of this an increa&s;ed ab&s;orption commences to replace this moi&s;ture, and the &s;kin and mouth become dry, and the pulmonary mucus becomes in&s;pi&s;&s;ated; which &s;timulates the bronchia, and is rai&s;ed into froth by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive currents of air in evacuating it. This production of froth is called by &s;ome free-drinkers "&s;pitting &s;ixpences" after a debauch. This &s;ub&s;equent thir&s;t, dry mouth, and
<PB N="182" REF="1920">
vi&s;cid expectoration in &s;ome people &s;ucceeds the &s;lighte&s;t degree of intoxication, of which it may be e&s;teemed a criterion. See Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 8.</P>
<P>As coughs are not always attended with pain, the mu&s;cular actions, which produce them, are &s;ometimes excited by the &s;en&s;orial faculty of irritation, as in Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 8. I. 1. 3. 4. I. 1. 4. 3. I. 2. 3. 4. Coughs are al&s;o &s;ometimes convul&s;ive, as in Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. 10. and &s;ometimes &s;ympathetic, as Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 7.</P>

<P N="6">6. <HI>Singultus.</HI> Hiccough is an exertion of the mu&s;cles u&s;ed in in|&s;piration excited into more violent action by the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en|&s;ation, in con&s;equence of &s;omething which too powerfully &s;timu|lates the cardia ventriculi, or upper orifice of the &s;tomach. As when &s;olid food is too ha&s;tily taken without &s;ufficient dilution. And is an effort to di&s;lodge that offen&s;ive material, and pu&s;h it to &s;ome le&s;s &s;en&s;ible part of the &s;tomach, or into the middle of the contained aliment.</P>
<P>At the end of fatal fevers it may ari&s;e from the acrimony of the undige&s;ted aliment, or from a part of the &s;tomach being already dead, and by its weight or coldne&s;s affecting the &s;urviving part with di&s;a|greeable &s;en&s;ation. The pain about the upper orifice of the &s;tomach is the proximate cau&s;e, the too great or too little action of the fibres of this part of the &s;tomach is the remote cau&s;e, the action of the mu&s;|cles u&s;ed in in&s;piration is the proximate effect, and the repercu&s;&s;ion of the offending material is the remote effect.</P>
<P>Hiccough is &s;ometimes &s;ympathetic, occa&s;ioned by the pain of gravel in the kidney or ureter, as in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 7. and is &s;ome|times a &s;ymptom of epilep&s;y or reverie, as in Sect. XIX. 2.</P>

7. <HI>A&s;thma humorale.</HI> The humoral a&s;thma probably con&s;i&s;ts in a temporary ana&s;arca of the lungs, which may be owing to a tempo|rary defect of lymphatic ab&s;orption. Its cau&s;e is neverthele&s;s at pre|&s;ent very ob&s;cure, &s;ince a temporary deficiency of venous ab&s;orption, at the extremities of the pulmonary or bronchial veins, might occa&s;ion a &s;imilar difficulty of re&s;piration. See Abortio, Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 14. Or it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the lymph effu&s;ed into the cavity of the che&s;t might, by &s;ome additional heat during &s;leep, acquire an aerial form, and thus compre&s;s the lungs; and on this circum&s;tance the re|lief, which the&s;e patients receive from cold air, would be readily ac|counted for.</P>
<P>The paroxy&s;ms attack the patient in his fir&s;t &s;leep, when the cir|culation through the lungs in weak people wants the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the voluntary power. Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 3. And hence the ab&s;orbents of the lungs are le&s;s able to fulfil the whole of their duty. And part of the thin mucus, which is &s;ecreted into the air-cells, remains there un|ab&s;orbed, and occa&s;ions the difficult re&s;piration, which awakes the patient. And the violent exertions of the mu&s;cles of re&s;piration, which &s;ucceed, are excited by the pain of &s;uffocation, for the purpo&s;e of pu&s;hing forwards the blood through the compre&s;&s;ed capillaries, and to promote the ab&s;orption of the effu&s;ed lymph.</P>
<P>In this the humoral differs from the convul&s;ive a&s;thma, treated of in Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. 10. as in that there is probably no accumulated fluid to be ab&s;orbed; and the violent re&s;piration is only an exertion for the purpo&s;e of relieving pain, either in the lungs or in &s;ome di&s;tant part, as in other convul&s;ions, or epilep&s;y; and in this re&s;pect the &s;its of humoral and convul&s;ive a&s;thma e&s;&s;entially differ from each other, con|trary to the opinion expre&s;&s;ed without &s;ufficient con&s;ideration in Sect. XVIII. 15.</P>
<P>The patients in the paroxy&s;ms both of humoral and convul&s;ive a&s;thma find relief from cold air, as they generally ri&s;e out of bed, and open the window, and put out their heads; for the lungs are not
<PB N="184" REF="1940">
&s;en&s;ible to cold, and the &s;en&s;e of &s;uffocation is &s;omewhat relieved by there being more oxygen contained in a given quantity of cold fre&s;h air, than in the warm confined air of a clo&s;e bed-chamber.</P>
<P>I have &s;een humoral a&s;thma terminate in confirmed ana&s;arca, and de&s;troy the patient, who had been an exce&s;&s;ive drinker of &s;pirituous potation. And M. Savage a&s;&s;erts, that this di&s;ea&s;e frequently termi|nates in diabetes; which &s;eems to &s;hew, that it is a temporary drop&s;y relieved by a great flow of urine. Add to this, that the&s;e paroxy&s;ms of the a&s;thma are them&s;elves relieved by profu&s;e &s;weats of the upper parts of the body, as explained in Cla&s;s I. 3. 2. 8. which would coun|tenance the idea of their being occa&s;ioned by conge&s;tions of lymph in the lungs.</P>
<P>The conge&s;tion of lymph in the lungs from the defective ab&s;orp|tion of it is probably the remote cau&s;e of humoral a&s;thma; but the pain of &s;uffocation is the immediate cau&s;e of the violent exertions in the paroxy&s;ms. And whether this conge&s;tion of lymph in the air|cells of the lungs increa&s;es during our &s;leep, as above &s;ugge&s;ted, or not; the pain of &s;uffocation will be more and more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing after &s;ome hours of &s;leep, as the &s;en&s;ibility to internal &s;timuli increa&s;es during that time, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XVIII. 15. For the &s;ame rea&s;on many epileptic fits, and paroxy&s;ms of the gout, occur during &s;leep.</P>
<P>In two gouty ca&s;es, complicated with jaundice, and pain, and &s;ick|ne&s;s, the patients had each of them a &s;hivering fit, like the com|mencement of an ague, to the great alarm of their friends; both which commenced in the night, I &s;uppo&s;e during their &s;leep; and the con&s;equence was a ce&s;&s;ation of the jaundice, and pain about the &s;tomach, and &s;ickne&s;s; and in&s;tead of that the gout appeared in their extremities. In the&s;e ca&s;es I conjecture, that there was a meta&s;ta&s;is not only of the di&s;ea&s;ed action from the membranes of the liver to tho&s;e of the foot; but that &s;ome of the new ve&s;&s;els, or new fluids, which were previou&s;ly produced in the inflamed liver, were tran&s;lated
<PB N="185" REF="1950">
to the feet during the cold fit, by the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of the he|patic lymphatics, and by the retrograde motions of tho&s;e of the af|fected limbs.</P>
<P>This I think re&s;embles in &s;ome re&s;pects a fit of humoral a&s;thma, where &s;tronger motions of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the lungs are ex|cited, and retrograde ones of the corre&s;pondent cutaneous lymphatics; whence the violent &s;weats of the upper parts of the body only are produced; and for a time the patient becomes relieved by the me|ta&s;ta&s;is and elimination of the offending material by &s;en&s;itive exer|tion.

<P>In this &s;pecies of a&s;thma, there is great rea&s;on to believe, that the re&s;piration of an atmo&s;phere, with an increa&s;ed proportion of oxygen, will prove of great advantage; &s;ome well-ob&s;erved and well-atte&s;ted ca&s;es of which are publi&s;hed by Dr. Beddoes; as this purer air invigo|rates the circulation, and the whole &s;y&s;tem in con&s;equence, perhaps not only by its &s;timulus, but by its &s;upplying the material from which the &s;en&s;orial power is extracted or fabricated.

<P>There are however other cau&s;es, which render parturition more dangerous to the ladies of high life; &s;uch as their greater general de|bility from neglect of energetic exerci&s;e, their inexperience of the va|riations of cold and heat, and their &s;eclu&s;ion from fre&s;h air. To which mu&s;t be added, that great &s;ource of the de&s;truction of female grace

and beauty, as well as of female health, the tight &s;tays, and other bandages, with which they are generally tortured in their early years by the active folly of their friends, which by di&s;placing many of the vi&s;cera impedes their actions, and by compre&s;&s;ing them together pro|duces adhe&s;ions of one part to another, and affects even the form and aperture of the bones of the pelvis, through which the na&s;cent child mu&s;t be protruded.</P>
<P>As parturition is a natural, not a morbid proce&s;s, no medicine &s;hould be given, where there is no appearance of di&s;ea&s;e.

<P>IN the fir&s;t cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es two kinds of fevers were de&s;cribed, one from exce&s;s, and the other from defect of irritation; and were in con&s;equence termed irritative, and inirritative fevers.

But there is no fever from defect of &s;en&s;ation, becau&s;e the circulation is carried on in health without our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that is, without any &s;en&s;ation attending it.</P>
<P>But as exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ation may exi&s;t with exce&s;s or defect of irrita|tion, two other kinds of fever ari&s;e from a combination of &s;en&s;itive fever with the irritative, and inirritative ones. Making five kinds in all.</P>

<PB N="191" REF="2010">
of the &s;pecies enumerated under the third genus of this order, it is placed at the head of them. And as the &s;en&s;itive fever attends the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ixth genus, it is placed at the head of them. But as every febrile paroxy&s;m con&s;i&s;ts of di&s;ordered tribes or trains of a&s;&s;oci|ated motions, it may be doubted, whether they ought not all to have been placed in the fourth cla&s;s, among&s;t the di&s;ea&s;es of a&s;&s;o|ciation. See Cla&s;s IV. 2. 4. 11.</P>
<P>All the &s;ub&s;equent &s;pecies of this genus are attended with &s;en&s;itive irritated fever; there are neverthele&s;s &s;ome &s;uperficial inflammations, which affect the &s;ame &s;ituations without much fever, as the &s;cro|phulous ophthalmy and &s;purious peripneumony, which belong to other genera.</P>
<P>Inflammation is uniformly attended with the production or &s;ecre|tion of new fibres con&s;tituting new ve&s;&s;els; this therefore may be e&s;teemed its e&s;&s;ential character, or the criterion of its exi&s;tence. The exten&s;ion of the old ve&s;&s;els &s;eems rather a con&s;equence than a cau&s;e of the germination, or pullulation, of the&s;e new ones; for the old ve&s;|&s;els may be enlarged, and excited with unu&s;ual energy, without any production of new ones, as in the blu&s;h of &s;hame or of anger.</P>
<P>When the&s;e new ve&s;&s;els are formed, if they are not reab&s;orbed into the circulation, they &s;ecrete a new fluid called purulent matter; which generally opens it&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age on the external &s;kin, and pro|duces an ulcer, which either gradually heals, or &s;preads, and is the cau&s;e of hectic fever; or they &s;ecrete contagious matter, which has the property of exciting the &s;ame kind of inflammation, and of pro|ducing the &s;ame kind of contagious matter, when in&s;erted by inocu|lation into the &s;kin of other per&s;ons. The&s;e contagious matters form ulcers, which either heal &s;pontaneou&s;ly, or by art; or continue to &s;pread, and de&s;troy the patient, by other kinds of hectic fever.</P>
<P>In this genus there is an increa&s;e of the &s;en&s;orial power of irrita|tion as well as of &s;en&s;ation; whence great arterial energy is produced, and the pul&s;e becomes &s;trong and full, as well as quick; and the
<PB N="192" REF="2020">
coats of the arteries feel hard under the finger, being them&s;elves thickened and di&s;tended by inflammation. The blood drawn, e&s;pe|cially at the &s;econd bleeding, is covered with a tough &s;ize; which is probably the mucus from the inflamed internal &s;urface of the arteries, increa&s;ed in quantity, and more coagulable than in its natural &s;tate; the thinner part being more perfectly ab&s;orbed by the increa&s;ed action of the inflamed ab&s;orbents. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 2. This is ren|dered more probable, becau&s;e the hard feel of the pul&s;e, and the abundance of coagulable lymph commence, exi&s;t, and cea&s;e to|gether.</P>
<P>Great heat is produced from the new chemical combinations ari&s;ing in the &s;ecretion of new fibres, and great pain from the di&s;tention of old ones, or from their increa&s;ed action. The increa&s;ed quantity of &s;en&s;ation from a topical inflammation or phlegmon is the immediate cau&s;e of the febris &s;en&s;itiva irritata, or inflammatory fever; as when it ari&s;es from the pain of pleuri&s;y, or paronychia; but generally an irritative fever precedes this topical inflammation, which occurs during the hot fit of it; and then the irritative fever is changed into a &s;en&s;itive irritated fever, by the additional cau&s;e of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation be&s;ides that of irritation.</P>

<P>When matter is thus formed in any internal vi&s;cus, or in the cel|lular membrane, as in the lungs or liver; &s;o long as this ab&s;ce&s;s re|mains without admi&s;&s;ion of air, this inflammatory fever is liable to continue, receiving only temporary relief by bleeding or emetics, or cathartics; till the patient, after a month, or two, or three, expires. But, if air be admitted to the&s;e internal ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, this kind of fever is changed into a hectic fever in a &s;ingle day. It al&s;o &s;ometimes hap|pens, that when the ab&s;ce&s;s remains unopened to the air, if the mat|ter has become putrid, that hectic fever &s;upervenes, with colliquative &s;weats, or diarrhoea; the matter in both ca&s;es is &s;ometimes ab&s;orbed, and the &s;ides of the ab&s;ce&s;s grow together again without an external aperture. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 4. 1. and 2. Another termination of in|flammation is in gangrene, but this belongs to the inflammation of the external &s;kin; as the production of purulent matter belongs to inflammation of the internal or mucous membranes. Thus when the external &s;kin is the &s;eat of inflammation, as in erythema, or ery|&s;ipelas, and produces &s;en&s;itive irritated fever, no collection of purulent matter can be formed; but a material oozes out, and lies upon the &s;urface, like that in the confluent &s;mall-pox, and the cuticle at length peels off, or gangrene &s;upervenes. It mu&s;t be noted, that the&s;e kinds of inflammation can exi&s;t together; and &s;ome parts of the cel|lular membrane may &s;uppurate at the &s;ame time that the external &s;kin is affected with erythema, or ery&s;ipelas.</P>

<P>The increa&s;ed arterial action in this &s;en&s;itive irritated fever is not &s;imply owing to the increa&s;ed irritability of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, or to the &s;timulus of the di&s;tention of the ve&s;&s;els, but al&s;o to the increa&s;ed acrimony or pungency of the blood; which has now &s;o far changed

its nature as to become more fluid, more den&s;e, and to be loaded with coagulable lymph. Hence it becomes nece&s;&s;ary not only to le&s;&s;en the quantity of blood by vene&s;ection and by cathartics, but al&s;o to dilute its acrimony, or pungency, by the introduction of aqueous and mu|cilaginous fluids, &s;uch as barley water, cream and water, &s;ugar and water, weak broths; to which may be added &s;o much of &s;ome ve|getable e&s;&s;ential oil, as may render them grateful to the &s;tomach, and thus promote their ab&s;orption, as by infu&s;ing par&s;ley or cellery and turneps in the broth; or by balm, mint, or &s;age teas.</P>
<P>The following &s;pecies of this genus only di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ituation of the part previou&s;ly inflamed, and which is the remote cau&s;e of the &s;en&s;itive irritated, or inflammatory fever, which attends it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ophthalmia interna.</HI> Inflammation of the eye is attended with the production of new ve&s;&s;els, which &s;pread over the tunica adjunc|tiva, and over the cornea; the&s;e new ve&s;&s;els are ea&s;ily &s;een, as they lie on a white ground, and give ocular demon&s;tration of their pro|duction in inflammation. When this inflammation of the cornea &s;uppurates, it is liable to leave little ulcers, which may be &s;een be|neath the &s;urface in the form of little excavations; and as the&s;e heal, they are liable to be covered with an opake &s;car. This &s;car, in &s;ome months or years, is liable to wear away, and become tran&s;parent, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any poli&s;hing powder, as of very finely le|vigated gla&s;s, as &s;ome have recommended.

exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible to light, by partaking of the inflammation; and I have been told, that red colours are in the&s;e ca&s;es &s;ometimes painfully perceived even in perfect darkne&s;s. This &s;hews that the retina is ex|cited into motion by the &s;timulus of light; and that, when it is in|flamed, the&s;e motions give great pain, like tho&s;e of other inflamed parts, as the mu&s;cles, or membranes. And &s;econdly, that the ideas of colours con&s;i&s;t in the motions of the retina; which ideas occa&s;ion pain, when the extremity of the moving nerve is inflamed.</P>
<P>M. M. Vene&s;ection. Cathartics. Diluents. Torpentia. Fre|quently moi&s;ten the eye with cold water by means of a rag. Cool airy room. Darkne&s;s. When the inflammation begins to decline, white vitriol gr. vi. in an ounce of water is more efficacious to moi&s;|ten the eye than &s;olutions of lead. Tincture of opium diluted. New ve&s;&s;els from the inflamed tunica adnata frequently &s;pread like a fly's wing upon the tran&s;parent cornea, which is then called Pterigium. To &s;top the growth of this, the principal ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be cut through with a lancet. When the inflammation begins to decline, after due evacuation any &s;timulating material put into the eye in|crea&s;es the ab&s;orption, which &s;oon removes the new red ve&s;&s;els; which has given ri&s;e to a hundred famous eye-waters, and eye-doc|tors; if the&s;e &s;timulating materials are u&s;ed too &s;oon, the inflamma|tion is increa&s;ed by them. See Sect. XXXII. 2. 10.</P>
<P>There is another ophthalmia, which attends weak children, and is generally e&s;teemed a &s;ymptom of &s;crophula, as de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s II. 1. 5. 3. and another, which is of venereal origin, mentioned in Cla&s;s II. 1. 5. 2. both which may be termed ophthalmia &s;uper|ficialis.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Phrenitis.</HI> Inflammation of the brain is attended with into|lerance of light and &s;ound; which &s;hews, that the extremities of the nerves of tho&s;e &s;en&s;es are at the &s;ame time inflamed; it is al&s;o attend|ed with great pain of the head, with watchfulne&s;s, and furious delirium.
<PB N="196" REF="2060">
The violent efforts, the&s;e patients are &s;aid &s;ometimes to exert, are owing to the increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain; as all other inflamed glands have a greater circulation of blood pa&s;&s;ing through them, and a greater &s;ecretion in con&s;equence of their pecu|liar fluids, as in the hepatitis much more bile is generated.</P>
<P>M. M. Vene&s;ection. Cathartics. Torpentia. Foment the head with cold water for hours together. Or with warm water. Cool airy room. Afterwards cupping on the occiput. Leeches to the temples. When the patient is weakened a bli&s;ter on the head, and after further exhau&s;tion five or &s;ix drops of tincture of opium.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Peripneumonia.</HI> Inflammation of the lungs. The pul&s;e is not always hard, &s;ometimes &s;oft; which is probably owing to a degree of &s;ickne&s;s or inaction of the &s;tomach; with dull pain of the che&s;t; re&s;piration con&s;tantly difficult, &s;ometimes with erect po&s;ture; the face bloated and purpli&s;h; cough generally with moi&s;t expectoration, often &s;tained with blood.</P>
<P>When the difficulty of re&s;piration is very great, the patient is not able to cough; in this &s;ituation, after copious bleeding, the cough is liable to return, and is &s;o far a favourable &s;ymptom, as it &s;hews &s;ome abatement of the inflammation.</P>
<P>A peripneumony frequently occurs in the chin-cough, and de&s;troys the patient, except immediate recour&s;e be had to the lancet, or to four or five leeches; when blood cannot be otherwi&s;e taken.</P>
<P>The peripneumony is very fatal to young children, e&s;pecially as I believe it is frequently mi&s;taken for a &s;pa&s;modic a&s;thma, or for the croup, or cynanche trachealis of Cullen. Both which, however, when they occur, require immediate vene&s;ection by the lancet or by leeches, as well as the peripneumony.</P>
<P>The croup is an inflammation of the upper part, and the peripneu|mony of the lower part of the &s;ame organ, viz. the trachea or wind|pipe. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 4. But as the inflammation is &s;eldom I &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="197" REF="2070">
confined to the upper part of the trachea only, but exi&s;ts at the &s;ame time in other parts of the lungs, and as no inflammation of the ton&s;ils is generally perceptible, the uncouth name of cynanche trache|alis &s;hould be changed for <HI>peripneumonia trachialis.</HI> The method of cure con&s;i&s;ts in immediate and repeated bleeding. A vomit. A grain of calomel or other mild cathartic. Bathing in &s;ubtepid water, and in breathing over the &s;team of warm water, with or without a little vinegar in it. And la&s;tly, by keeping the child rai&s;ed high in bed.</P>
<P>Inflammation of the lungs is al&s;o liable to occur in the mea&s;les, and mu&s;t be attacked by vene&s;ection at any time of the di&s;ea&s;e; other|wi&s;e either a pre&s;ent death, or an incurable con&s;umption, is the con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>The peripneumony is frequently combined with inflammation of the pleura, and &s;ometimes with that of the diaphragm; either of the&s;e may generally be di&s;tingui&s;hed, not only by the pain which at|tends inflammation of the&s;e membranes, but by in&s;pecting the naked che&s;t, and ob&s;erving whether the patient breathes more by elevating the ribs, or by depre&s;&s;ing the diaphragm.</P>
<P>A cri&s;is happens in children about the &s;ixth day with much pale urine, which mu&s;t be waited for after evacuations have been u&s;ed, as far as can be done with &s;afety; in this &s;ituation the warm bath twice a day, and &s;mall bli&s;ters repeatedly in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, are of peculiar &s;ervice.</P>
<P>After the termination of peripneumony a collection of coagulable lymph is frequently left in the cavity of the che&s;t unab&s;orbed; or a common ana&s;arca of the lungs occurs from the pre&s;ent inaction of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which had previou&s;ly been excited too violently. This difficulty of breathing is cured or relieved by the exhibition of digitalis. See Art. IV. 2. 8.</P>
<P>M. M. The lancet is the anchor of hope in this di&s;ea&s;e; which mu&s;t be repeated four or five times, or as often as the fever and dif|ficulty of breathing increa&s;e, which is generally in the evening; antimonials,
<PB N="198" REF="2080">
diluents, repeated &s;mall bli&s;ters about the che&s;t, mucilage, pediluvium, warm bath. Is a decoction of &s;eneka-root of u&s;e? Do not neutral &s;alts increa&s;e the tendency to cough by their &s;timulus, as they increa&s;e the heat of urine in gonorrhoea? Children in every kind of difficult breathing, from whatever cau&s;e, &s;hould be kept as up|right in bed as may be, and continually watched; &s;ince, if they &s;lip down, they are liable to be immediately &s;uffocated. After the patient is greatly debilitated, &s;o that no further evacuation can be admitted, and the difficult breathing and cough continue, I have given four or five drops of tincture of opium, that is, about a quarter of a grain of &s;olid opium, with great advantage, and I believe in &s;everal ca&s;es I have &s;aved the patient. A greater quantity of opium in this &s;tate of debility cannot be u&s;ed without hazarding the life of the per&s;on. This &s;mall quantity of an opiate &s;hould be given about &s;ix in the evening, or before the acce&s;s of the evening paroxy&s;m, and repeated three or four nights, or longer.</P>
<P>There is a peripneumony with weak pul&s;e, which may be termed <HI>peripneumonia inirritata,</HI> as de&s;cribed in Sect. XXVII. 2. which be|longs to this place. See al&s;o Superficial Peripneumony, Cla&s;s II. 1. 3. 7.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Pleuritis.</HI> Pleuri&s;y. Inflammation of the pleura, with hard pul&s;e, pain chiefly of the &s;ide, pungent, particularly increa&s;ed during in&s;piration; lying on either &s;ide unea&s;y, the cough very painful, dry at the beginning, afterwards moi&s;t, often bloody.</P>
<P>One cau&s;e of pleuri&s;y is probably a previous adhe&s;ion of the lungs to a part of the pleura, which envelops them. This in many ca&s;es has been produced in infancy, by &s;uffering children to lie too long on one &s;ide. Or by placing them uniformly on one &s;ide of a fire, or window, to which they will be liable always to bend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When matter is produced during peripneumony or pleuri&s;y in one &s;ide of the che&s;t, &s;o long as it is a concealed vomica, the fever continues,
<PB N="199" REF="2090">
if the di&s;ea&s;e be great, for many weeks, and even months; and requires occa&s;ional vene&s;ection, till the patient &s;inks under the inflammatory or &s;en&s;itive irritated fever. But if air be admitted, by a part of the ab&s;ce&s;s opening it&s;elf a way into the air-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, a hectic fever, with colliquitive &s;weats or diarrhoea, &s;upervenes, and frequently de&s;troys the patient; or the ab&s;ce&s;s heals the lungs ad|hering to the pleura.</P>
<P>M. M. The lancet mu&s;t be u&s;ed copiou&s;ly, and repeated as often as the pain and difficult re&s;piration increa&s;e. A bli&s;ter on the pained part. Antimonial preparations. Diluents. Cool air. Do neutral &s;alts increa&s;e the tendency to cough? Pediluvium or &s;emicupium frequently repeated.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Diaphragmitis.</HI> Inflammation of the diaphragm. Pain round the lower ribs as if girt with a cord. Difficult re&s;piration performed only by elevating the ribs and in an erect po&s;ture. The corners of the mouth frequently retracted into a di&s;agreeable &s;mile, called ri&s;us Sardonicus.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e animals, which are furni&s;hed with clavicles, or collar-bones, not only u&s;e their foremo&s;t feet as hands, as men, monkies, cats, mice, &s;quirrels, &amp;c. but elevate their ribs in re&s;piration as well as depre&s;s the diaphragm for the purpo&s;e of enlarging the cavity of the che&s;t. Hence an inflammation of the diaphragm is &s;udden death to tho&s;e animals, as hor&s;es and dogs, which can only breathe by de|pre&s;&s;ing the diaphragm; and is I &s;uppo&s;e the cau&s;e of the &s;udden death of hor&s;es that are over-worked; whereas, in the human animal, when the diaphragm is inflamed, &s;o as to render its motions impo&s;|&s;ible from the pain they occa&s;ion, re&s;piration can be carried on, though in a le&s;s perfect manner, by the interco&s;tal mu&s;cles in the ele|vation of the ribs. In pleuri&s;y the ribs are kept motionle&s;s, and the re&s;piration is performed by the diaphragm, as may be readily &s;een on in&s;pecting the naked che&s;t, and which is generally a bad &s;ymptom;
<PB N="200" REF="2100">
in the diaphragmitis the ribs are alternately elevated, and depre&s;&s;ed, but the lower part of the belly is not &s;een to move.</P>
<P>M. M. As in pleuri&s;y and peripneumony. When the patient be|comes delirious, and &s;miles di&s;agreeably by intervals, and is become &s;o weak, that evacuations by the lancet could be u&s;ed no further, and I have almo&s;t de&s;paired of my patient, I have found in two or three in&s;tances, that about five or &s;ix drops of tinct. thebaic. given an hour before the evening exacerbation, has had the happie&s;t effect, and cured the patient in this ca&s;e, as well as in common peripneu|mony; it mu&s;t be repeated two or three evenings, &s;ee Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 4. as the exacerbation of the fever and difficult re&s;piration and delirium generally increa&s;e towards night.</P>
<P>The &s;timulus of this &s;mall quantity of opium on a patient previ|ou&s;ly &s;o much debilitated, acts by increa&s;ing the exertion of the ab|&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, in the &s;ame manner as a &s;olution of opium, or any other &s;timulant, put on an inflamed eye after the ve&s;&s;els are previou&s;ly emptied by evacuations, &s;timulates the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, &s;o as to cau&s;e the remaining new ve&s;&s;els to be immediately reab&s;orbed. Which &s;ame &s;timulants would have increa&s;ed the inflammation, if they had been applied before the evacuations. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 2. Sect. XXXIII. 3. 1. When the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem is full of blood, the ab&s;orbents cannot act &s;o powerfully, as the progre&s;s of their con|tents is oppo&s;ed by the previous fulne&s;s of the blood-ve&s;&s;els; whence &s;timulants in that ca&s;e increa&s;e the action of the &s;ecerning &s;y&s;tem more than of the ab&s;orbent one; but after copious evacuation this re|&s;i&s;tance to the progre&s;s of the ab&s;orbed fluids is removed; and when &s;timulants are then applied, they increa&s;e the action of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem more than that of the &s;ecerning one. Hence opium given in the commencement of inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es de&s;troys the patient; and cures them, if given in very &s;mall do&s;es at the end of inflamma|tory di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

7. <HI>Carditis.</HI> Inflammation of the heart is attended with un|equal intermitting pul&s;e, palpitation, pain in the middle of the &s;ter|num, and con&s;tant vomiting. It cannot certainly be di&s;tingui&s;hed from peripneumony, and is perhaps always combined with it.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Peritonitis.</HI> Inflammation of the peritonaeum is known by pain all over the abdomen, which is increa&s;ed on erecting the body. It has probably mo&s;t frequently a rheumatic origin. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 17.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Me&s;enteritis.</HI> Inflammation of the me&s;entery is attended with pains like colic, and with curdled or chyle-like &s;tools. It is a very frequent and dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, as the production of matter more readily takes place in it than in any other vi&s;cus. The con&s;equence of which, after a hard labour, is probably the puerperal fever, and in &s;crophulous habits a fatal purulent fever, or hopele&s;s con|&s;umption.</P>
<P>M. M. Vene&s;ection. Warm bath. Emollient cly&s;ters.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Ga&s;tritis.</HI> In inflammation of the &s;tomach the pul&s;e is gene|rally &s;oft, probably occa&s;ioned by the &s;ickne&s;s which attends it. The pain and heat of the &s;tomach is increa&s;ed by whatever is &s;wallowed, with immediate rejection of it. Hiccough.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e may be occa&s;ioned by acrid or indige&s;tible matters taken into the &s;tomach, which may chemically or mechanically in|jure its interior coat. There is however a &s;lighter &s;pecies of inflam|mation of this vi&s;cus, and perhaps of all others, which is unattended by much fever; and which is &s;ometimes induced by drinking cold water, or eating cold in&s;ipid food, as raw turnips, when the per&s;on has been much heated and fatigued by exerci&s;e. For when the &s;en|&s;orial power has been dimini&s;hed by great exertion, and the &s;tomach has become le&s;s irritable by having been previou&s;ly &s;timulated by much heat, it &s;ooner becomes quie&s;cent by the application of cold.
<PB N="202" REF="2120">
In con&s;equence of this &s;light inflammation of the &s;tomach an eruption of the face frequently en&s;ues by the &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation of this vi&s;cus with the &s;kin, which is called a &s;urfeit. See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 2. 13. and II. 1. 4. 6. and II. 1. 3. 19.</P>

<P N="11">11. <HI>Enteritis.</HI> Inflammation of the bowels is often attended with &s;oft pul&s;e, probably owing to the concomitant &s;ickne&s;s; which pre|vents &s;ometimes the early u&s;e of the lancet, to the de&s;truction of the patient. At other times it is attended with &s;trong and full pul&s;e like other inflammations of internal membranes. Can the &s;eat of the di&s;|ea&s;e being higher or lower in the inte&s;tinal canal, that is, above or below the valve of the colon, produce this difference of pul&s;e by the greater &s;ympathy of one part of the bowels with the &s;tomach than another? In enteritis with &s;trong pul&s;e the pain is great about the navel, with vomiting, and the greate&s;t difficulty in procuring a &s;tool. In the other, the pain and fever is le&s;s, without vomiting, and with diarrhoea. Whence it appears, that the enteritis with hard quick pul&s;e differs from Ileus, de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s I. 3. 1. 6. only in the ex|i&s;tence of fever in the former and not the latter, the other &s;ymptoms generally corre&s;ponding; and, &s;econdly, that the enteritis with &s;ofter quick pul&s;e, differs from the cholera de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s I. 3. 1. 5. only in the exi&s;tence of fever in the former, and not the latter, the other &s;ymptoms being in general &s;imilar. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 3. 20.</P>
<P>Inflammation of the bowels &s;ometimes is owing to extraneous in|dige&s;tible &s;ub&s;tances, as plum-&s;tones, e&s;pecially of the dama&s;in, which has &s;harp ends. Sometimes to an intro&s;u&s;ception of one part of the inte&s;tine into another, and very frequently to a &s;trangulated hermia or rupture. In re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, I knew an in&s;tance where a dama&s;in &s;tone, after a long period of time, found its way out of the body near the groin. I knew another child, who vomited &s;ome dama&s;in &s;tones, which had lain for near twenty hours, and given
<PB N="203" REF="2130">
great pain about the navel, by the exhibition of an emetic given in repeated do&s;es for about an hour. The &s;wallowing of plum-&s;tones in large quantities, and even of cherry-&s;tones, is annually fatal to many children. In re&s;pect to the intro&s;u&s;ception and hermia, &s;ee Ileus, Cla&s;s I. 3. 1. 6.</P>
<P>M. M. Repeated vene&s;ection. Calomel from ten to twenty grains given in &s;mall pills as in Ileus; the&s;e means u&s;ed early in the di&s;ea&s;e generally &s;ucceed. After the&s;e evacuations a bli&s;ter contributes to &s;top the vomiting. Warm bath. Crude mercury. Aloes one grain|pill every hour will frequently &s;tay in the &s;tomach. Glauber's &s;alt di&s;&s;olved in pepper-mint water given by repeated &s;poonfuls.</P>
<P>When the patient is much reduced, opium in very &s;mall do&s;es may be given, as a quarter of a grain, as recommended in pleuri&s;y. If the pain &s;uddenly cea&s;es, and the patient continues to vomit up what|ever is given him, it is generally fatal; as it indicates, that a morti|fication of the bowel is already formed. Some authors have advi&s;ed to join cathartic medicines with an opiate in inflammation of the bowels, as recommended in colica &s;aturnina. This may &s;ucceed in &s;lighter ca&s;es, but is a dangerous practice in general; &s;ince, if the ob&s;truction be not removed by the evacuation, the &s;timulus of the opium is liable to increa&s;e the action of the ve&s;&s;els, and produce mortification of the bowel, as I think I have &s;een more than once.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Hepatitis.</HI> Inflammation of the liver is attended with &s;trong quick pul&s;e; ten&s;ion and pain of the right &s;ide; often pungent as in pleuri&s;y, oftner dull. A pain is &s;aid to affect the clavicle, and top of the right &s;houlder; with difficulty in lying on the left &s;ide; difficult re&s;piration; dry cough; vomiting; hiccough.</P>
<P>There is another hepatitis mentioned by authors, in which the fever, and other &s;ymptoms, are wanting, or are le&s;s violent; as de|&s;cribed in Cla&s;s II. 1. 4. 11. and which is probably &s;ometimes relieved
<PB N="204" REF="2140">
by eruptions of the face; as in tho&s;e who are habituated to the in|temperate u&s;e of fermented liquors.</P>
<P>M. M. Hepatic inflammation is very liable to terminate in &s;up|puration, and the patient is de&s;troyed by the continuance of a fever with &s;izy blood, but without night-&s;weats, or diarrhoea, as in other unopened ab&s;ce&s;&s;es. Whence copious and repeated vene&s;ection is re|quired early in the di&s;ea&s;e, with repeated do&s;es of calomel, and ca|thartics. Warm bath. Towards the end of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;mall do&s;es of opium before the evening paroxy&s;ms, and la&s;tly the Peruvian bark, and chalybeate wine, at fir&s;t in &s;mall do&s;es, as 20 drops twice a day, and afterwards, if nece&s;&s;ary, in larger.

<P>Mrs. C. a lady in the la&s;t month of her pregnancy, was &s;eized with violent hepatitis, with &s;ymptoms both of peripneumony and of pleu|ri&s;y, for it &s;eldom happens in violent inflammations, that one vi&s;cus alone is affected; &s;he wanted then about a fortnight of her delivery, and after frequent vene&s;ection, with gentle cathartics, with fomenta|tion or warm bath, &s;he recovered and was &s;afely delivered, and both her&s;elf and child did well. Rheumatic and eruptive fevers are more liable to induce abortion.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Splenitis.</HI> Inflammation of the &s;pleen commences with ten&s;ion, heat, and tumour of the left &s;ide, and with pain, which is increa&s;ed by pre&s;&s;ure. A ca&s;e is de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 18. where a tumid &s;pleen, attended with fever, terminated in &s;chirrus of that vi&s;cus.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Nephritis.</HI> Inflammation of the kidney &s;eems to be of two kinds; each of them attended with different &s;ymptoms, and different modes of termination. One of them I &s;uppo&s;e to be an inflammation of the external membrane of the kidney, ari&s;ing from general cau&s;es of inflammation, and accompanied with pain in the loins without vo|miting; and the other to con&s;i&s;t in an inflammation of the interior
<PB N="205" REF="2150">
parts of the kidney, occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulus of gravel in the pelvis of it, which is attended with perpetual vomiting, with pain along the cour&s;e of the ureter, and retraction of the te&s;tis on that &s;ide, or numbne&s;s of the thigh.</P>
<P>The former of the&s;e kinds of nephritis is di&s;tingui&s;hed from lum|bago by its &s;ituation being more exactly on the region of the kidney, and by its not being extended beyond that part; after three or four days I believe this inflammation is liable to change place; and that a herpes or ery&s;ipelas, called zona, or &s;hingles, breaks out about the loins in its &s;tead; at other times it is cured by a cathartic with calo|mel, with or without previous vene&s;ection.</P>
<P>The other kind of nephritis, or inflammation of the interior part of the kidney, generally ari&s;es from the pain occa&s;ioned by the &s;timu|lus of a &s;tone entering the ureter from the pelvis of the kidney; and which cea&s;es when the &s;tone is protruded forwards into the bladder; or when it is returned into the pelvis of the kidney by the retrograde action of the ureter. The kidney is neverthele&s;s inflamed more fre|quently, though in a le&s;s degree, from other cau&s;es; e&s;pecially from the intemperate ingurgitation of ale, or other fermented or &s;pirituous liquors. This le&s;s degree of inflammation is the cau&s;e of gravel, as that before mentioned is the effect of it. The mucus &s;ecreted to lu|bricate the internal &s;urface of the uriniferous tubes of the kidney be|comes &s;ecreted in greater quantity, when the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are inflamed; and, as the corre&s;pondent ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els act more energetically at the &s;ame time, the ab&s;orption of its more fluid parts is more power|fully effected; on both the&s;e accounts the mucus becomes both changed in quality and more indurated. And in this manner &s;tones are produced on almo&s;t every mucous membrane of the body; as in the lungs, bowels, and even in the pericordium, as &s;ome writers have affirmed.

<P>The &s;tone in the bladder is generally formed in the kidney, and pa&s;&s;ing down the ureter into the bladder becomes there gradually in|crea&s;ed in &s;ize; and this mo&s;t frequently by the appo&s;ition of concen|tric &s;pheres, as may be &s;een by &s;awing &s;ome of the harder calculi through the middle, and poli&s;hing one &s;urface. The&s;e new concre|tions &s;uperinduced on the nucleus, which de&s;cended from the kidney, as de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 9. and in the preceding article of this genus, is not owing to the microco&s;mic &s;alt, which is often &s;een to adhere to the &s;ides of chamber-pots, as this is &s;oluble in warm water, but to the mucus of the bladder, as it rolls along the internal &s;urface of it. Now when the bladder is &s;lightly inflamed, this mucus of its internal &s;urface is &s;ecreted in greater quantity, and is more indurated by the ab&s;orption of its more liquid part at the in&s;tant of &s;ecretion, as explained in Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 9. and II. 1. 2. 14. and thus the &s;timulus and pain of a &s;tone in the bladder contributes to its enlargement by inflaming the interior coat of it.</P>

Some accoucheurs have had a practice of intro|ducing their hand into the uterus immediately after the birth of the child, to take away the placenta; which they &s;aid was to &s;ave time. Many women I believe have been victims to this unnatural practice.</P>
<P>Others have received injury, where inflammation has been begin|ning, by the univer&s;al practice of giving a large do&s;e of opium imme|diately on delivery, without any indication of its propriety; which, though a proper and u&s;eful medicine, where the patient is too feeble, when given in a &s;mall do&s;e, as 10 drops of tincture of opium, or half a grain of &s;olid opium, mu&s;t do a proportionate injury, when it is given improperly; and as delivery is a natural proce&s;s, it is certainly more wi&s;e to give no medicines, except there be &s;ome morbid &s;ymp|tom, which requires it; and which has only been introduced into cu&s;tom by the ill-employed activity of the Prie&s;ts or Prie&s;te&s;&s;es of LUCINA; like the concomitant non&s;en&s;e of cramming rue or rheu|barb into the mouth of the unfortunate young &s;tranger, who is thus &s;oon made to experience the evils of life.

But when this cold fit or torpor of the&s;e membranes, or ligaments or mu&s;cles of the back, is &s;ucceeded by a hot fit, and con&s;equent inflammation, a violent inflammatory fever, with great pain, occurs, preventing the erect po&s;ture of the body; and the affected part is liable to &s;uppurate, in which ca&s;e a very dangerous ulcer is formed, and a part of one of the vertebrae is generally found carious, and the patient &s;inks after a long time under the hectic fever occa&s;ioned by the aerated or oxy|genated matter.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">With the Production of new Ve&s;&s;els by external Membranes or Glands, with Fever.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;es of this genus are perhaps all productive of contagious matter; or which becomes &s;o by its expo&s;ure to the air, either through the cuticle, or by immediate contact with it; &s;uch are the matters of the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les. The purulent matter formed on parts covered from the air by thicker membranes or mu&s;cles, as in the preceding genus, does not induce fever, and cannot therefore be called contagious; but it acquires this property of producing fever in a few hours, after the ab&s;ce&s;s has been opened, &s;o as to admit the air to its &s;urface, and may then be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of contagious mia&s;mata. This kind of contagious matter only induces fever, but does not pro|duce other matter with properties &s;imilar to its own; and in this re|&s;pect it differs from the contagious mia&s;mata of &s;mall-pox or mea&s;les, but re&s;embles tho&s;e which have their origin in crowded jails; for the&s;e produce fever only, which frequently de&s;troys the patient; but do not produce other matters &s;imilar to them&s;elves; as appears from none of tho&s;e, who died of the jail-fever, caught at the famous black a&s;&s;izes at Oxford, at the beginning of this century, having infected their phy&s;icians or attendants.</P>
<P>If indeed the matter has continued &s;o long as to become putrid, and thus to have given out air from a part of it, it acquires the power of producing fever; in the &s;ame manner as if the ulcer had been opened, and expo&s;ed to the common air; in&s;tances of which are not
<PB N="212" REF="2220">
unfrequent. And from the&s;e circum&s;tances it &s;eems probable, that the matters &s;ecreted by the new ve&s;&s;els formed in all kinds of phleg|mons, or pu&s;tles, are not contagious, till they have acquired &s;ome|thing from the atmo&s;phere, or from the gas produced by putrefaction; which will account for &s;ome phenomena in the lues venerea, cancer, and of other contagious &s;ecretions on the &s;kin without fever, to be mentioned hereafter. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 4. 14.</P>
<P>The theory of contagion has been perplexed by comparing it with fermenting liquors; but the contagious material is &s;hewn in Section XXXIII. to be produced like other &s;ecreted matters by certain animal motions of the terminations of the ve&s;&s;els. Hence a new kind of gland is formed at the terminations of the ve&s;&s;els in the eruptions of the &s;mall-pox; the animal motions of which produce from the blood va|riolous matter; as other glands produce bile or &s;aliva. Now if &s;ome of this matter is introduced beneath the cuticle of a healthy per&s;on, or enters the circulation, and excites the extremities of the blood|ve&s;&s;els into tho&s;e kinds of di&s;ea&s;ed motions, by which it was it&s;elf produced, either by irritation or a&s;&s;ociation, the&s;e di&s;ea&s;ed motions of the extremities of the ve&s;&s;els will produce other &s;imilar contagious matter. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 5. and 9. Hence contagion &s;eems to be propagated two ways; one, by the &s;timulus of contagious matter applied to the part, which by an unknown law of nature excites the &s;timulated ve&s;&s;els to produce a &s;imilar matter; as in venereal ulcers, which thus continue to &s;pread; or as when variolous matter is in|&s;erted beneath the cuticle; or when it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be ab&s;orbed, and diffu&s;ed over the body mixed with the blood, and applied in that manner to the cutaneous glands. The other way, by which con|tagion &s;eems to be diffu&s;ed, is by &s;ome di&s;tant parts &s;ympathizing or imitating the motions of the part fir&s;t affected; as the &s;tomach and &s;kin in the eruptions of the inoculated &s;mall-pox, or in the bite of a mad dog; as treated of in Sect. XXII. 3. 3.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the di&s;ea&s;es of this genus the pul&s;e is &s;trong, full, and
<PB N="213" REF="2230">
hard, con&s;tituting the &s;en&s;itive irritated fever, as de&s;cribed in the preceding genus; as in one kind of ery&s;ipelas, which requires re|peated vene&s;ection. In others the arterial action is &s;ometimes mo|derate, &s;o as to con&s;titute the &s;en&s;itive fever, as in the inoculated &s;mall-pox; where the action of the arteries is neither increa&s;ed by the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, as in the &s;en&s;itive irritated fever; nor de|crea&s;ed by the defect of that power, as in the &s;en&s;itive inirritated fever. But in the greate&s;t number of the di&s;ea&s;es of this genus the arterial action is greatly dimini&s;hed in re&s;pect to &s;trength, and con&s;e|quently the frequency of pul&s;ation is proportionally increa&s;ed, as ex|plained in Sect. XXXII. 2. 1. Which is owing to the deficiency of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation joined with the increa&s;e of that of &s;en&s;ation, and thus con&s;titutes the &s;en&s;itive inirritated fever; as in Scarlatina with gangrenous ton&s;ils.</P>
<P>From this great debility of the action of the arteries, there appears to be le&s;s of the coagulable lymph or mucus &s;ecreted on their internal &s;urfaces; whence there is not only a defect of that buff or &s;ize upon the blood, which is &s;een on the &s;urface of that, which is drawn in the &s;en&s;itive irritated fever; but the blood, as it cools, when it has been drawn into a ba&s;on, &s;carcely coagulates; and is &s;aid to be di&s;&s;olved, and is by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed to be in a &s;tate of actual putrefaction. See Sect. XXXIII. 1. 3. where the truth of this idea is controverted. But in the fevers of both this genus and the preceding one great heat is produced from the chemical combinations in the &s;ecretions of new ve&s;&s;els and fluids, and pain or unea&s;ine&s;s from the di&s;tention of the old ones; till towards the termination of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;en&s;ation cea&s;es, as well as irritation, with the mortification of the affected parts, and the death of the patient.</P>
<P>Dy&s;enteria, as well as ton&s;illitis and aphtha, are enumerated among&s;t the di&s;ea&s;es of external membranes, becau&s;e they are expo&s;ed either to the atmo&s;pheric air, which is breathed, and &s;wallowed with our food and &s;aliva; or they are expo&s;ed to the inflammable air, or
<PB N="214" REF="2240">
hydrogen, which is generated in the inte&s;tines; both which contri|bute to produce or promote the contagious quality of the&s;e fluids; as mentioned in Cla&s;s II. 1. 5.</P>
<P>It is not &s;peaking accurate language, if we &s;ay, that in the di&s;ea&s;es of this genus the fever is contagious; &s;ince it is the material produced by the external membranes, which is contagious, after it has been expo&s;ed to air; while the fever is the con&s;equence of this contagious matter, and not the cau&s;e of it. As appears from the inoculated &s;mall-pox, in which the fever does not commence, till after &s;uppura|tion has taken place in the inoculated arm, and from the di&s;ea&s;es of the fifth genus of this order, where contagion exi&s;ts without fever.

The immediate cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e is the increa&s;e of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation, joined with the decrea&s;e of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation; that is, it con|&s;i&s;ts in the febris &s;en&s;itiva joined with the febris inirritativa of Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 1. as the febris &s;en&s;itiva irritata of the preceding genus con&s;i&s;ts of the febris &s;en&s;itiva joined with the febris irritativa of Cla&s;s I. 1. 1. 1.

<P>This fever is frequently accompanied with topical inflammation, which is liable, if the arterial &s;trength is not &s;upported, to end in &s;phacelus; and as mortified parts, &s;uch as &s;loughs of the throat, if they adhere to living parts, &s;oon become putrid from the warmth and moi&s;ture of their &s;ituation; the&s;e fevers have been termed putrid, and have been thought to owe their cau&s;e to what is only their con&s;equence.
<PB N="215" REF="2250">
In hot climates this fever is frequently induced by the ex|halations of &s;tagnating lakes or mar&s;hes, which abound with animal &s;ub&s;tances; but which in colder countries produce fevers with debility only, as the quartan ague, without inflammation.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;itive inirritated, or malignant, fever is al&s;o frequently produced by the putrid exhalations and &s;tagnant air in pri&s;ons; but perhaps mo&s;t frequently by contact or near approach of the per&s;ons, who have re&s;ided in them. The&s;e cau&s;es of malignant fevers contri|buted to produce, and to &s;upport for a while, the &s;eptic and anti&s;eptic theory of them; &s;ee Sect. XXXIII. 1. 3. The vibices or brui&s;es, and petechiae or purples, were believed to be owing to the di&s;&s;olved &s;tate of the blood by its incipient putrefaction; but hydro&s;tatical ex|periments have been made, which &s;hew the &s;izy blood of the patient in &s;en&s;itive irritated or inflammatory fever, with &s;trong pul&s;e, is more fluid, while it is warm, than this uncoagulable blood taken in this &s;en&s;itive inirritated, or malignant fever; from whence it is inferred, that the&s;e petechiae, and vibices, are owing to the deficient power of ab&s;orption in the terminations of the veins. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 5.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;itive inirritated fever, or typhus gravior, is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the inirritative fever, or typhus mitior, in the early &s;tages of it, by the colour of the &s;kin; which in the latter is paler, with le&s;s heat, owing to the le&s;s violent action of the capillaries; in this it is higher coloured, and hotter, from the greater energy of the capillary action in the production of new ve&s;&s;els. In the more advanced &s;tate pe|techiae, and the production of contagious matter from inflamed mem|branes, as the aphthae of the mouth, or ulcers of the throat, di&s;|tingui&s;hes this fever from the former. Delirium, and dilated pupils of the eyes, are more frequent in nervous fevers; and &s;tupor with deafne&s;s more frequent attendants on malignant fevers. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 5. 6.</P>
<P>There is another criterion di&s;cernible by the touch of an experi|enced finger; and that is, the coat of the artery in in&s;lammatory
<PB N="216" REF="2260">
fevers, both tho&s;e attended with &s;trength of pulfation, and the&s;e with weak pul&s;ation, feels harder, or more like a cord; for the coats of the arteries in the&s;e fevers are them&s;elves inflamed, and are con&s;equently turgid with blood, and thence are le&s;s ea&s;ily compre&s;&s;ed, though their pul&s;ations are neverthele&s;s weak: when the artery is large or full with an inflamed coat, it is called hard; and when &s;mall or empty with an inflamed coat, it is called &s;harp, by many writers.</P>
<P>M. M. The indications of cure con&s;i&s;t, 1. In procuring a regur|gitation of any offen&s;ive material, which may be lodged in the long mouths of the lacteals or lymphatics, or in their tumid glands. 2. To excite the &s;y&s;tem into nece&s;&s;ary action by the repeated exhibition of nutrientia, &s;orbentia, and incitantia; and to pre&s;erve the due eva|cuation of the bowels. 3. To prevent any unnece&s;&s;ary expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power. 4. To prevent the formation of ulcers, or to promote the ab&s;orption in them, for the purpo&s;e of healing them.</P>
<P N="1">1. One ounce of wine of ipecacuanha, or about ten grains of the powder, &s;hould be given as an emetic. After a few hours three or four grains of calomel &s;hould be given in a little mucilage, or con|&s;erve. Where &s;omething &s;wallowed into the &s;tomach is the cau&s;e of the fever, it is liable to be arre&s;ted by the lymphatic glands, as the matter of the &s;mall-pox inoculated in the arm is liable to be &s;topped by the axillary lymphatic gland; in this &s;ituation it may continue a day or two, or longer, and may be regurgitated during the operation of an emetic or cathartic into the &s;tomach or bowel, as evidently hap|pens on the exhibition of calomel, as explained in Sect. XXIX. 7. 2. For this rea&s;on an emetic and cathartic, with vene&s;ection, if in|dicated by the hardne&s;s and fulne&s;s of the pul&s;e, will very fre|quently remove fevers, if exhibited on the fir&s;t, &s;econd, or even third day.</P>

greater degree of debility is produced from the expenditure of &s;en|&s;orial power in unnece&s;&s;ary motions. Many weak patients have been thus &s;timulated to death. See Sect. XII. 7. 8. The Peruvian bark &s;hould be given al&s;o in repeated do&s;es in &s;uch quantity only as may &s;trengthen dige&s;tion, not impede it. For the&s;e purpo&s;es two ounces of wine, or of ale, or cyder, &s;hould be given every &s;ix hours; and two ounces of decoction of bark, with two drachms of the tincture of bark, and &s;ix drops of tincture of opium, &s;hould be given al&s;o every &s;ix hours alternately; that is, each of them four times in twenty-four hours. As much rhubarb as may induce a daily evacu|ation, &s;hould be given to remove the colluvies of indige&s;ted materials from the bowels; which might otherwi&s;e increa&s;e the di&s;tre&s;s of the patient by the air it gives out in putrefaction, or by producing a diarrhoea by its acrimony; the putridity of the evacuations are in con&s;equence of the total inability of the dige&s;tive powers; and their delay in the inte&s;tines, to the inactivity of that canal in re&s;pect to its peri&s;taltic motions.</P>
<P>The q$antities of wine or beer and opium, and bark, above men|tioned, may be increa&s;ed by degrees, if the patient &s;eems refre&s;hed by them; and if the pul&s;e becomes &s;lower on their exhibition; but this with caution, as I have &s;een irrecoverable mi&s;chief done by greater quantities both of opium, wine, and bark, in this kind of fever; in which their u&s;e is to &s;trengthen the dige&s;tion of the weak patient, rather than to &s;top the paroxy&s;ms of fever; but when they are ad|mini&s;tered in intermittents, much larger quantities are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The &s;timulus of &s;mall bli&s;ters applied in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, one every three or four days, when the patient becomes weak, is of great &s;ervice by &s;trengthening dige$tion, and by preventing the coldne&s;s of the extre|mities, owing to the &s;ympathy of the &s;kin with the &s;tomach, and of one part of the &s;kin with another.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to nutriment, the patient &s;hould be &s;upplied with wine and water, with toa&s;ted bread, and &s;ugar or &s;pice in it; or with

&s;ago with wine; fre&s;h broth with turnips, cellery, par&s;ley; fruit; new milk.

If &s;ome parts are too cold, as the extremities, while other parts are too hot, as the face or brea&s;t, cover the cold parts with flannel, and cool the hot parts by a current of cool air, or bathing them as above.</P>
<P N="4">4. For the healing of ulcers, if in the mouth, &s;olution of alum in water about 40 grains to an ounce, or of blue vitriol in water, one grain or two to an ounce may be u&s;ed to touch them with three or four times a day. Of the&s;e perhaps a &s;olution of alum is to be pre|ferred, as it in&s;tantly takes away the &s;tench from ulcers I &s;uppo&s;e by combining with the volatile alcali which attends it. For this purpo&s;e a &s;olution of alum of an ounce to a pint of water &s;hould be frequently injected by means of a &s;yringe into the mouth. If there are ulcers on the external &s;kin, fine powder of bark &s;even parts, and ceru&s;&s;a in fine powder one part, &s;hould be mixed, and applied dry on the &s;ore, and kept on by lint, and a bandage.</P>
<P>As &s;loughs in the mouth are frequently produced by the previous dryne&s;s of the membranes, which line it, this dryne&s;s &s;hould be prevented by frequently moi&s;tening them, which may be effected by injection with a &s;yringe, or by a moi&s;t &s;ponge, or la&s;tly in the $ollow|ing manner. Place a gla&s;s of wine and water, or of milk and &s;ugar,
<PB N="219" REF="2290">
on a table by the bed&s;ide, a little above the level of the mouth of the patient; then, having previou&s;ly moi&s;tened a long piece of narrow li&s;ting, or cloth, or flannel, with the &s;ame liquor, leave one end of it in the gla&s;s, and introduce the other into the mouth of the patient; which will thus be &s;upplied with a con&s;tant oozing of the fluid through the cloth, which acts as a capillary &s;yphon.</P>
<P>The vi&s;cid phlegm, which adheres to the tongue, &s;hould be coagulated by &s;ome au&s;tere acid, as by lemon-juice evaporated to half its quantity, or by crab-juice; and then it may be &s;craped off by a knife, or rubbed off by flannel, or a &s;age leaf dipped in vinegar, or in &s;alt and water.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ery&s;ipelas,</HI> St. Anthony's fire, may be divided into three kinds, which differ in their method of cure, the irritated, the inirritated, and the &s;en&s;itive ery&s;ipelas.</P>
<P><HI>Ery&s;ipelas irritatum</HI> is attended with increa&s;e of irritation be&s;ides increa&s;e of &s;en&s;ation; that is, with &s;trong, hard, and full pul&s;e, which requires frequent vene&s;ection, like other inflammations with arterial &s;trength. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the phlegmonic inflammations of the la&s;t genus by its &s;ituation on the external habit, and by the red|ne&s;s, heat, and tumour not being di&s;tinctly circum&s;cribed; &s;o that the eye or finger cannot exactly trace the extent of them.</P>
<P>When the external &s;kin is the &s;eat of inflammation, and produces &s;en&s;itive irritated fever, no collection of matter is formed, as when a phlegmon is &s;ituated in the cellular membrane beneath the &s;kin; but the cuticle ri&s;es as beneath a bli&s;ter-pla&s;ter, and becomes ruptured; and a yellow material oozes out, and becomes in&s;pi$$ated, and lies upon its &s;urface; as is &s;een in this kind of cry&s;ipelas, and in the con|fluent &s;mall pox; o$ if the new ve&s;&s;els are reab&s;orbed the cuticle peels off in &s;cales. This diffe$ence of the termination of ery&s;ipelatous and p$legmonic inflammation &s;eems to be owing in part to the le&s;s di&s;ten|$$$$lity of the cuticle than of the cellular membrane, and in part to
<PB N="220" REF="2300">
the ready exhalation of the thinner parts of the &s;ecreted fluids through its pores.</P>
<P>This ery&s;ipelas is generally preceded by a fever for two or three days before the eruption, which is liable to appear in &s;ome places, as it declines in others; and &s;eems frequently to ari&s;e from a previous &s;cratch or injury of the &s;kin; and is attended &s;ometimes with inflam|flammation of the cellular membrane beneath the &s;kin; whence a real phlegmon and collection of matter becomes joined to the ery&s;i|pelas, and either occa&s;ions or increa&s;es the irritated fever, which at|tends it.</P>
<P>There is a greater &s;ympathy between the external &s;kin and the meninges of the brain, than between the cellular membrane and tho&s;e meninges; whence ery&s;ipelas is more liable to be preceded or attended, or &s;ucceeded, by delirium than internal phlegmons. I ex|cept the mumps, or parotitis, de&s;cribed below; which is properly an external gland, as its excretory duct opens into the air. When pain of the head or delirium precedes the cutaneous eruption of the face, there is &s;ome rea&s;on to believe, that the primary di&s;ea&s;e is a torpor of the meninges of the brain; and that the &s;ucceeding violent action is transferred to the &s;kin of the face by &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation; and that a &s;imilar &s;ympathy occurs between &s;ome internal membranes and the &s;kin over them, when ery&s;ipelas appears on other parts of the body. If this circum&s;tance &s;hould be &s;upported by further evidence, this di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould be removed into Cla&s;s IV. along with the rheu|mati&s;m and gout. See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 2. 17.</P>
<P>This &s;uppo&s;ed retropul&s;ion of ery&s;ipelas on the brain from the fre|quent appearance of delirium, has prevented the free u&s;e of the lancet early in this di&s;ea&s;e to the de&s;truction of many; as it has prevented the &s;ubduing of the general inflammation, and thus has in the end produced the particular one on the brain. Mr. B&mdash;, a delicate gentleman about &s;ixty, had an ery&s;ipelas beginning near one $ar, and extending by degrees over the whole head, with hard, full, and &s;trong
<PB N="221" REF="2310">
pul&s;e; blood was taken from him four or five times in con&s;iderable quantity, with gentle cathartics, with calomel, diluents, and cool air, and he recovered without any &s;igns of delirium, or inflammation of the meninges of the brain. Mr. W&mdash;, a &s;trong corpulent man of inferior life, had ery&s;ipelas over his whole head, with &s;trong hard pul&s;e: he was not evacuated early in the di&s;ea&s;e through the timidity of his apothecary, and died delirious. Mrs. F&mdash;had ery&s;ipelas on the face, without either &s;trong or weak pul&s;e; that is, with &s;en|&s;itive fever alone, without &s;uperabundance or deficiency of irritation; and recovered without any but natural evacuations. From the&s;e three ca&s;es of ery&s;ipelas on the head it appears, that the evacuations by the lancet mu&s;t be u&s;ed with courage, where the degree of inflam|mation requires it; but not where this degree of inflammation is &s;mall, nor in the ery&s;ipelas attended with inirritation, as de&s;cribed below.</P>
<P>M. M. Vene&s;ection repeated according to the degree of inflam|mation. An emetic. Calomel three grains every other night. Cool air. Diluents, emetic tartar in &s;mall do&s;es, as a quarter of a grain every &s;ix hours. Tea, weak broth, gruel, lemonade, neutral &s;alts. See Sect. XII. 6.</P>
<P>Such external applications as carry away the heat of the &s;kin may be of &s;ervice, as cold water, cold flour, &s;now, ether. Becau&s;e the&s;e applications impede the exertions of the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els, which are now in too great action; but any applications of the &s;timulant kind, as &s;olutions of lead, iron, copper, or of alum, u&s;ed early in the di&s;|ea&s;e, mu&s;t be injurious; as they &s;timulate the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els, as well as the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, into greater action; exactly as occurs when &s;timulant eye waters are u&s;ed too &s;oon in ophthalmy. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 2. But as the cuticle peels off in this ca&s;e after the inflammation cea&s;es, it differs from ophthalmy; and &s;timulant appli|cations are not indicated at all, except where &s;ymptoms of gangrene appear. For as a new cuticle is formed under the old one, as under
<PB N="222" REF="2320">
a bli&s;ter, the &s;erous fluid between them is a defence to the new cuticle, and &s;hould dry into a &s;cab by exhalation rather than be re|ab&s;orbed. Hence we &s;ee how grea&s;y or oily applications, and even how moi&s;t ones, are injurious in ery&s;ipelas; becau&s;e they prevent the exhalation of the &s;erous effu&s;ion between the old and new cuticle, and thus retard the formation of the latter.</P>
<P><HI>Ery&s;ipelas inirritatum</HI> differs from the former in its being attended with weak pul&s;e, and other &s;ymptoms of &s;en&s;itive inirritated fever. The feet and legs are particularly liable to this ery&s;ipelas, which pre|cedes or attends the &s;phacelus or morti$$cation of tho&s;e parts. A great and long coldne&s;s fir&s;t affects the limb, $$d the ery&s;ipelas on the &s;kin &s;eems to occur in con&s;equence of the pre$$ous torpor of the interior membranes. As this generally attends old age, it becomes more dan|gerous in proportion to the age, and al&s;o to the habitual intemperance of the patient in re&s;pect to the u&s;e of fermented or &s;pirituous liquor.</P>
<P>When the former kind, or irritated ery&s;ipelas, continues lo$g, the patient becomes &s;o weakened as to be liable to all the &s;ympto$$ of this inirritated ery&s;ipelas; e&s;pecially where the meninges of the brain are primarily affected. As in that ca&s;e, after two or three effo$$$ have been made to remove the returning periods of torpor of the meninges to the external &s;kin, tho&s;e meninges become inflamed them&s;elves, and the patient &s;inks under the di&s;ea&s;e; in a manner &s;imilar to that in old gouty patients, where the torpor of the liver or &s;tomach is relieved by a&s;&s;ociation of the inflammation of the membranes of the feet, and then of other joints, and la&s;tly the power of a&s;&s;ociation cea&s;ing to act, but the exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ation continuing, the liver $r &s;tomach remains torpid, or become them&s;elves inflamed, and the pa|tient is de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>M. M. Where there exi&s;ts a beginning gangrene of the extre|mities, the Peruvian bark, and wine, and opium, are to be given in large quantities; &s;o as to &s;trengthen the patient, but not to intoxicate,
<PB N="223" REF="2330">
or to impede his dige&s;tion of aliment, as mentioned in the fir&s;t &s;pecies of this genus. Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 1. But where the brain is inflamed or oppre&s;&s;ed, which is known either by delirium, with quick pul&s;e; or by &s;tupor, and &s;low re&s;piration with &s;low pul&s;e; other means mu&s;t be applied. Such as, fir&s;t, a fomentation on the head with warm water, with or without aromatic herbs, or &s;alt in it, &s;hould be con|tinued for an hour or two at a time, and frequently repeated. A bli&s;ter may al&s;o be applied on the head, and the fomentation neverthele&s;s occa&s;ionally repeated. Internally very gentle &s;timulants, as camphor one grain or two in infu&s;ion of valerian. Wine and water or &s;mall beer, weak broth. An enema. Six grains of rhubarb and one of calomel. Afterwards five drops of tincture of opium, which may be repeated every &s;ix hours, if it &s;eems of &s;ervice. Might the head be bathed for a minute with cold water? or with ether? or vinegar?</P>
<P><HI>Ery&s;ipelas &s;en&s;itivum</HI> is a third &s;pecies, differing only in the kind of fever which attends it, which is &s;imply inflammatory, or &s;en&s;itive, without either exce&s;s of irritation, as in the fir&s;t variety; or the defect of irritation, as in the &s;econd variety: all the&s;e kinds of ery&s;ipelas are liable to return by periods in &s;ome people, who have pa&s;&s;ed the middle of life, as at periods of a lunation, or two lunations, or at the equinoxes. When the&s;e periods of ery&s;ipelas happen to women, they &s;eem to &s;upply the place of the receding catamenia; when to men, I have &s;ometimes believed them to be a&s;&s;ociated with a torpor of the liver; as they generally occur in tho&s;e who have drank vinous &s;pirit exce&s;&s;ively, though not approbriou&s;ly; and that hence they &s;upply the place of periodical piles, or gout, or gutta ro&s;ea.</P>
<P>M. M. As the fever requires no management, the di&s;ea&s;e takes its progre&s;s &s;afely, like a moderate paroxy&s;m of the gout; but in this ca&s;e, as in &s;ome of the former, the ery&s;ipelas does not appear to be a primary di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;hould perhaps be removed to the Cla&s;s of A&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="224" REF="2340">
3. <HI>Ton&s;illitis.</HI> Inflammation of the ton&s;ils. The uncouth term Cynanche has been u&s;ed for di&s;ea&s;es &s;o di&s;&s;imilar, that I have divided them into Ton&s;illitis and Parotitis; and hope to be excu&s;ed for adding a Greek termination to a Latin word, as one of tho&s;e languages may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as a dialect of the other. By ton&s;illitis the in|flammation of the ton&s;ils is principally to be under&s;tood; but as all inflammations generally &s;pread further than the part fir&s;t affected; &s;o, when the &s;ummit of the windpipe is al&s;o much inflamed, it may be termed ton&s;illitis trach$alis, or croup. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 4. and II. 1. 2. 4.; and when the &s;ummit of the gullet is much inflamed along with the ton&s;il, it may be called ton&s;illitis pharyngea, as de&s;cribed in Dr. Cullen's No&s;ologia, Genus X. p. 92. The inflammation of the ton&s;ils may be divided into t$$ee kinds, which require different me|thods of cure.</P>
<P><HI>Ton&s;illitis interna.</HI> Inflammation of the internal ton&s;il. When the &s;welling is &s;o con&s;iderable as to produce difficulty of breathing, the &s;ize of the ton&s;il &s;hould be dimini&s;hed by cutting it with a proper lancet, which may either give exit to the matter it contains, or may make it le&s;s by di&s;charging a part of the blood. This kind of angina is frequently attended with irritated fever be&s;ides the &s;en&s;itive one, which accompanies all inflammation, and &s;ometimes requires vene|&s;ection. An emetic &s;hould be given early in the di&s;ea&s;e, as by its in|ducing the retrograde action of the ve&s;&s;els about the fauces during the nau&s;ea it occa&s;ions, it may eliminate the very cau&s;e of the inflamma|tion; which may have been taken up by the ab&s;orbents, and &s;till continue in the mouths of the lymphatics or their glands. The pa|tient &s;hould then be induced to &s;wallow &s;ome aperient liquid, an in|fu&s;ion of &s;enna, &s;o as to induce three or four evacuations. Gargles of all kinds are rather hurtful, as the action of u&s;ing them is liable to give pain to the inflamed parts; but the patients find great relief from frequently holding warm water in their mouths, and putting it out again, or by &s;yringing warm water into the mouth, as this acts
<PB N="225" REF="2350">
like a warm bath or fomentation to the inflamed part. La&s;tly, &s;ome mild &s;timulant, as a weak &s;olution of &s;alt and water, or of white vi|triol and water, may be u&s;ed to wa&s;h the fauces with in the decline of the di&s;ea&s;e, to expedite the ab&s;orption of the new ve&s;&s;els, if ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as recommended in ophthalmy.</P>
<P><HI>Ton&s;illitis &s;uperficialis.</HI> Inflammation of the &s;urface of the ton&s;ils. As the ton&s;ils and parts in their vicinity are covered with a membrane, which, though expo&s;ed to currents of air, is neverthele&s;s con&s;tantly kept moi&s;t by mucus and &s;aliva, and is liable to di&s;ea&s;es of its &s;urface like other mucous membranes, as well as to &s;uppuration of the in|ternal &s;ub&s;tance of the gland; the inflammation of its &s;urface is &s;ucceeded by &s;mall elevated pu&s;tules with matter in them, which &s;oon di&s;appears, and the parts either readily heal, or ulcers covered with &s;loughs are left on the &s;urface.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is generally attended with only &s;en&s;itive fever, and therefore is of no danger, and may be di&s;tingui&s;hed with great cer|tainty from the dangerous inflammation or gangrene of the ton&s;ils at the height of the &s;mall-pox, or &s;carlet fever, by its not being attended with other &s;ymptoms of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. One emetic and a gentle cathartic is generally &s;ufficient; and the frequent &s;wallowing of weak broth, or gruel, both without &s;alt in them, relieves the patient, and ab&s;olves the cure. When the&s;e tumours of the ton&s;ils frequently return I have &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected them to originate from the ab|&s;orption of putrid matter from decaying teeth. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 21. and II. 2. 2. 1.</P>
<P><HI>Ton&s;illitis inirritata.</HI> Inflammation of the ton&s;ils with &s;en&s;itive inirritated fever is a &s;ymptom only of contagious fever, whether attended with &s;carlet eruption, or with confluent &s;mall-pox, or other|wi&s;e. The matter of contagion is generally diffu&s;ed, not di&s;&s;olved in the air; and as this is breathed over the mucaginous &s;urface of the ton&s;ils, the contagious atoms are liable to be arre&s;ted by the ton&s;il; which th$r$fore becomes the ne&s;t of the future di&s;ea&s;e, like the
<PB N="226" REF="2360">
inflamed circle round the inoculated puncture of the arm in &s;uppo&s;i|titious &s;mall-pox. This &s;welling is liable to &s;uffocate the patient in &s;mall-pox, and to become gangrenous in &s;carlet fever, and &s;ome other contagious fevers, which have been received in this manner. The exi&s;tence of inflammation of the ton&s;il previous to the &s;carlet erup|tion, as the arm inflames in the inoculated &s;mall-pox, and &s;uppurates before the variolous eruption, &s;hould be a criterion of the &s;carlet fever being taken in this manner.</P>
<P>M. M. All the means which &s;trengthen the patient, as in the &s;en|&s;itive inirritated fever, Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 1. As it is liable to continue a whole lunation or more, great attention &s;hould be u&s;ed to nouri&s;h the patient with acidulous and vinous panada, broth with vegetables boiled in it, &s;ugar, cream, beer; all which given frequently will contribute much to moi&s;ten, clean, and heal the ulcu&s;cles, or &s;loughs, of the throat; warm water and wine, or acid of lemon, &s;hould be frequently applied to the ton&s;ils by means of a &s;yringe, or by means of a capillary &s;yphon, as de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 1. A &s;light &s;olution of blue vitriol, as two grains to an ounce, or a &s;olution of &s;ugar of lead of about &s;ix grains to an ounce, may be of &s;ervice; e&s;pecially the latter, applied to the edges of the &s;loughs, drop by drop by means of a &s;mall gla&s;s tube, or &s;mall crow-quill with the end cut off, or by a camel's-hair pencil or &s;ponge; to the end of either of which a drop will conveniently hang by capillary attraction; as &s;olut$ons of lead evidently impede the progre&s;s of ery&s;ipelas on the exterior &s;kin, when it is attended with feeble pul&s;e. Yet a &s;olution of alum injected frequently by a &s;yringe is perhaps to be preferre$, as it immediately removes the fetor of the breath, which mu&s;t much injure the patient by its being perpetually received into the lungs by re&s;pi$ation.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>P$rotitis.</HI> Mumps, or branks, is a contagious inflammation of the paro$is and maxillary glands, and has generally been cla&s;&s;ed under
<PB N="227" REF="2370">
the word Cynanche or Angina, to which it bears no analogy. It divides it&s;elf into two kinds, which differ in the degree of fever which attends them, and in the method of cure.</P>
<P><HI>Parotitis &s;uppurans.</HI> The &s;uppurating mumps is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the acutene&s;s of the pain, and the &s;en&s;itive, irritated, or inflamma|tory fever, which attends it.</P>
<P>M. M. Vene&s;ection. Cathartic with calomel three or four grains repeatedly. Cool air, diluents. This antiphlogi&s;tic treatment is to be continued no longer than is nece&s;&s;ary to relieve the violence of the pain, as the di&s;ea&s;e is attended with contagion, and mu&s;t run through a certain time, like other fevers with contagion.</P>
<P><HI>Parotitis mutabilis.</HI> Mutable parotitis. A &s;en&s;itive fever only, or a &s;en&s;itive irritated fever, generally attends this kind. And when the tumor of the parotis and maxillary glands &s;ub&s;ides, a new &s;welling occurs in &s;ome di&s;tant part of the &s;y&s;tem; as happens to the hands and feet, at the commencement of the &s;econdary fever of the &s;mall|pox, when the tumor of the face &s;ub&s;ides. This new &s;welling in the parotitis mutabilis is liable to affect the te&s;tes in men, and form a painful tumor, which &s;hould be prevented from &s;uppuration by very cautious means, if the violence of the pain threaten &s;uch a termina|tion; as by bathing the part with coldi&s;h water for a time, vene|&s;ection, a cathartic; or by a bli&s;ter on the perinaeum, or &s;crotum, or a poultice.</P>
<P>When women are affected with this complaint, after the &s;welling of the parotis and maxillary glands &s;ub&s;ides, a tumor with pain is liable to affect their brea&s;ts; which, however, I have never &s;een terminate in &s;uppuration.</P>
<P>On the retroce&s;&s;ion of the tumor of the te&s;tes above de&s;cribed, and I &s;uppo&s;e of that of the brea&s;ts in women, a delirium of the calm kind is very liable to occur; which in &s;ome ca&s;es has been the fir&s;t &s;ymp|tom which has alarmed the friends of the patient; and it has thence been difficult to di&s;cover the cau&s;e of it without much inquiry; the
<PB N="228" REF="2380">
previous &s;ymptoms having been &s;o &s;light as not to have occa&s;ioned any complaints. In this delirium, if the pul&s;e will bear it, vene|&s;ection &s;hould be u&s;ed, and three or four grains of calomel, with fomentation of the head with warm water for an hour together every three or four hours.</P>
<P>Though this di&s;ea&s;e generally terminates favourably, con&s;idering the numbers attacked by it, when it is epidemic, yet it is dangerous at other times in every part of its progre&s;s. Sometimes the parotis or maxillary glands &s;uppurate, producing ulcers which are difficult to cure, and frequently de&s;troy the patient, where there was a previous &s;crophulous tendency. The te&s;tis in men is al&s;o liable to &s;uppurate with great pain, long confinement, and much danger; and la&s;tly the affection of the brain is fatal to many.</P>
<P>Mr. W. W. had a &s;welled throat, which after a few days &s;ub&s;ided. He became delirious or &s;tupid, in which &s;tate he was dying when I &s;aw him; and his friends a&s;cribed his death to a coup de &s;oleil, which he was &s;aid to have received &s;ome months before, when he was abroad.</P>
<P>Mr. A. B. had a &s;welling of the throat, which after a few days &s;ub&s;ided. When I &s;aw him he had great &s;tupor, with &s;low breath|ing, and partial delirium. On fomenting his head with warm water for an hour the&s;e &s;ymptoms of &s;tupor were greatly le&s;&s;ened, and his oppre&s;&s;ed breathing gradually cea&s;ed, and he recovered in one day.</P>
<P>Mr. C. D. I found walking about the hou&s;e in a calm delirium without &s;tupor; and not without much inquiry of his friends could get the previous hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e; which had been attended with parotitis, and &s;welled te&s;tis, previous to the delirium. A few ounces of blood were taken away, a gentle cathartic was directed, and his head fomented with warm water for an hour, with a &s;mall bli&s;ter on the back, and he recovered in two or three days.</P>
<P>Mr. D. D. came down from London in the coach alone, &s;o that no previous hi&s;tory could be obtained. He was walking about the
<PB N="229" REF="2390">
hou&s;e in a calm delirium, but could give no &s;en&s;ible an&s;wers to any thing which was propo&s;ed to him. His pul&s;e was weak and quick. Cordials, a bli&s;ter, the bark, were in vain exhibited, and he died in two or three days.</P>
<P>Mr. F. F. came from London in the &s;ame manner in the coach. He was mildly deli$ious with con&s;iderable &s;tupor, and moderate pul&s;e, and could give no account of him&s;elf. He continued in a kind of cataleptic &s;tupor, &s;o that he would remain for hours in any po&s;ture he was placed, either in his chair, or in bed; and did not attempt to &s;peak for about a fortnight; and then gradually recovered. The&s;e two la&s;t ca&s;es are not related as being certainly owing to parotitis, but as they might probably have that origin.</P>
<P>The parotitis &s;uppu$ans, or mumps with irritated fever, is at times epidemic among cats, and may be called <HI>parotitis felina;</HI> as I have rea&s;on to believe from the &s;wellings under the jaws, which frequently &s;uppurate, and are very fatal to tho&s;e animals. In the village of Hay|wood, in Stafford&s;hire, I remember a whole breed of Per&s;ian cats, with long white hair, was de&s;troyed by this malady, along with almo&s;t all the common cats of the neighbourhood; and as the paro|titis or mumps had not long before prevailed among&s;t human beings in that part of the country, I recollect being inclined to believe, that the cats received the infection from mankind; though in all other contagious di&s;ea&s;es, except the rabies canina can be &s;o called, no dif|ferent genera of animals naturally communicate infection to each other; and I am informed, that vain efforts have been made to com|municate the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les to &s;ome quadrupeds by inocula|tion.

and by diluents internally, with moderate vene&s;ection and gentle ca|thartics. This may be termed catarrhus &s;en&s;itivus, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the catarrhus contagio&s;us, and is in common language called a violent cold in the head; it differs from the catarrhus calidus, or warm catarrh, of Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 7. in the production of new ve&s;&s;els, or inflammation of the membrane, and the con&s;equent more purulent appearance of the di&s;charge.</P>
<P>Rancedo catarrhalis, or catarrhal hoar&s;ene&s;s, is a frequent &s;ymptom of this di&s;ea&s;e, and is occa&s;ioned by the pain or &s;orene&s;s which attends the thickened and inflamed membranes of the larynx; which pre|vents the mu&s;cles of vocallity from &s;ufficiently contracting the aper|ture of it. It cea&s;es with the inflammation, or may be relieved by the &s;team of warm water alone, or of water and vinegar, or of water and ether. See Paralytic Hoar&s;ene&s;s, Cla&s;s III. 2. 1. 4.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Catarrhus contagio&s;us.</HI> This malady attacks &s;o many at the &s;ame time, and &s;preads gradually over &s;o great an extent of country, that there can be no doubt but that it is di&s;&s;eminated by the atmo|&s;phere. In the year 1782 the &s;un was for many weeks ob&s;cured by a dry fog, and appeared red as through a common mi&s;t. The ma|terial, which thus rendered the air muddy, probably cau&s;ed the epi|demic catarrh, which prevailed in that year, and which began far in the north, and extended it&s;elf over all Europe. See Botanic Garden, Vol. II. note on Chunda, and Vol. I. Canto IV. line 294, note; and was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been thrown out of a voleano, which much di&s;placed the country of Iceland.</P>
<P>In many in&s;tances there was rea&s;on to believe, that this di&s;ea&s;e be|came contagions, as well as epidemic; that is, that one per&s;on might receive it from another, as well as by the general un$alutary in|fluence of the atmo&s;phere. This is difficult to comprehend, but may be conce$$ed by con&s;idering the increa&s;e of contagious matter in the &s;mall-pox. In that di&s;ea&s;e one particle of contagious matter &s;timulates
<PB N="231" REF="2410">
the &s;kin of the arm in inoculation into morbid action &s;o as to produce a thou&s;and particles &s;imilar to it&s;elf; the &s;ame thing occurs in catarrh, a few deleterious atoms &s;timulate the mucous membrane of the no&s;trils into morbid actions, which produce a thou&s;and other particles &s;imilar to them&s;elves. The&s;e contagious particles diffu&s;ed in the air mu&s;t have con&s;i&s;ted of animal matter, otherwi&s;e how could an animal body by being &s;timulated by them produce &s;imilar particles? Could they then have had a volcanic origin, or mu&s;t they not rather have been blown from putrid mar&s;hes full of animal matter? But the greate&s;t part of the &s;olid earth has been made from animal and veget|able recrements, which may be di&s;per&s;ed by volcanos.&mdash;Future di&s;|coveries mu&s;t an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions.</P>
<P>As the &s;en&s;itive fever attending the&s;e epidemic catarrhs is &s;eldom either much irritated or inirritated, vene&s;ection is not always either clearly indicated or forbid; but as tho&s;e who have died of the&s;e catarrhs have generally had inflamed livers, with con&s;equent &s;uppu|ration in them, vene&s;ection is advi&s;eable, wherever the cough and fever are greater than common, &s;o as to render the u&s;e of the lancet in the lea&s;t dubious. And in &s;ome ca&s;es a &s;econd bleeding was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and a mild cathartic or two with four grains of calomel; with mucilaginous &s;ubacid diluents; and warm &s;team occa&s;ionally to alle|viate the cough, fini&s;hed the cure.</P>
<P>The catarrhus contagio&s;us is a frequent di&s;ea&s;e among&s;t hor&s;es and dogs; it &s;eems fir&s;t to be di&s;&s;eminated among&s;t the&s;e animals by mia&s;mata diffu&s;ed in the atmo&s;phere, becau&s;e &s;o many of them re|ceive it at the &s;ame time; and afterwards to be communicable from one hor&s;e or dog to another by contagion, as above de&s;cribed. The&s;e epidemic or contagious catarrhs more frequently occur among&s;t dogs and hor&s;es than among&s;t men; which is probably owing to the greater exten&s;ion and &s;en&s;ibility of the mucous membrane, which covers the organ of &s;mell, and is diffu&s;ed over their wide no&s;trils,
<PB N="232" REF="2420">
and their large maxillary and frontal cavities. And to this circum|&s;tance may be a&s;cribed the greater fatality of it to the&s;e animals.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to hor&s;es, I &s;u&s;pect the fever at the beginning to be of the &s;en&s;itive, irritated, or inflammatory kind, becau&s;e there is &s;o great a di&s;charge of purulent mucus; and that therefore they will bear once bleeding early in the di&s;ea&s;e; and al&s;o one mild purgative, con&s;i&s;ting of about half an ounce of aloe, and as much white hard &s;oap, mixed together. They &s;hould be turned out to gra&s;s both day and night for the benefit of pure air, unle&s;s the weather be too cold (and in that ca&s;e they &s;hould be kept in an open airy &s;table, without being tied), that they may hang down their heads to facilitate the di&s;charge of the mucus from their no&s;trils. Gra&s;s &s;hould be offered them, or other fre&s;h vegetables, as carrots and potatoes, with ma&s;hes of malt, or of oats, and with plenty of fre&s;h warm or cold water frequently in a day. When &s;ymptoms of debility appear, which may be known by the coldne&s;s of the ears or other extremities, or when &s;loughs can be &s;een on the membrane which lines the no&s;trils, a drink con&s;i&s;ting of a pint of ale with half an ounce of tincture of opium in it, given every &s;ix hours, is likely to be of great utility.</P>
<P>In dogs I believe the catarrh is generally joined with &s;ymptoms of debility early in the di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e animals &s;hould be permitted to go about in the open air, and &s;hould have con&s;tant acce&s;s to fre&s;h water. The u&s;e of being as much as may be in the air is evident, becau&s;e all the air which they breathe pa&s;&s;es twice over the putrid &s;loughs of the mo$ti$ied parts of the membrane which lines the no&s;trils, and the maxillary and frontal cavities; that is, both during $word$ and expiration; and mu&s;t therefore be loaded with con|tagious particles. Fre&s;h new milk, and fre&s;h broth, &s;hould be given them very frequently, and they &s;hould be &s;uffered to go among&s;t the g$a$s, which they &s;ometimes eat for the purpo&s;e of an emetic; and if po&s;&s;ible &s;hould have acce&s;s to a running &s;tream of water. As the
<PB N="233" REF="2430">
contagious mucus of the no&s;trils, both of the&s;e animals and of hor&s;es, generally drops into the water they attempt to drink. Bits of raw fle&s;h, if the dog will eat them, are preferred to cooked meat; and from five to ten drops of tincture of opium may be given with advan|tage, when &s;ymptoms of debility are evident, according to the &s;ize of the dog, every &s;ix hours. If &s;loughs can be &s;een in the no&s;trils, they &s;hould be moi&s;tened twice a day, both in hor&s;es and dogs, with a &s;olution of &s;ugar of lead, or of alum, by means of a &s;ponge fixed on a bit of whale bone, or by a &s;yringe. The lotion may be made by di&s;&s;olving half an ounce of &s;ugar of lead in a pint of water.</P>
<P>Ancient philo&s;ophers &s;eem to have believed, that the contagious mia&s;mata in their warm climates affected hor&s;es and dogs previous to mankind. If tho&s;e contagious particles were &s;uppo&s;ed to be diffu&s;ed among&s;t the heavy inflammable air, or carbonated hydrogen, of pu|trid mar&s;hes, as the&s;e animals hold their heads down lower to the ground, they may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have received them &s;ooner than men. And though men and quadrupeds might receive a di&s;ea&s;e from the &s;ame &s;ource of mar&s;h-putrefaction, they might not afterwards be able to infect each other, though they might infect other animals of the &s;ame genus; as the new contagious matter generated in their own bodies might not be preci&s;ely &s;imilar to that received; as hap|pened in the jail-fever at Oxford, where tho&s;e$who took the conta|gion and died, did not infect others.</P>

<P N="8">8. <HI>Pertu&s;&s;is.</HI> Tu&s;&s;is convul&s;iva. Chin-cough re&s;embles peripneu|monia &s;uperficialis in its con&s;i&s;ting in an inflammation of the mem|brane which lines the air-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs; but differs in the cir|cum&s;tance of its being contagious; and is on that account of very long duration; as the whole of the lungs are probably not infected at the &s;ame time, but the contagious inflammation continues gradually to creep on the membrane. It may in this re&s;pect be compared to the ulcers in the pulmonary con&s;umption; but it differs in this, that in chin-cough &s;ome branches of the bronchia heal, as others become inflamed.</P>
<P>This complaint is not u&s;ually cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t febrile di&s;orders, but a &s;en&s;itive fever may generally be perceived to attend it during &s;ome part of the day, e&s;pecially in weak patients. And a peripneu|mony very frequently &s;upervenes, and de&s;troys great numbers of chil|dren, except the lancet or four or &s;ix leeches be immediately and repeatedly u&s;ed. When the child has permanent difficulty of breath|ing, which continues between the coughing fits: unle&s;s blood be taken from it, it dies in two, three, or four days of the inflammation of the lungs. During this permanent difficulty of breathing the hooping-cough abates, or quite cea&s;es, and returns again after once
<PB N="235" REF="2450">
or twice bleeding; which is then a good &s;ymptom, as the child now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the power to cough &s;hews the difficulty of breathing to be abated. I dwell longer upon this, becau&s;e many lo&s;e their lives from the difficulty there is in bleeding young children; where the apo|thecary is old or clum&s;y, or is not furni&s;hed with a very &s;harp and fine-pointed lancet. In this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation the application of four leeches to one of the child's legs, the wounds made by which &s;hould continue to bleed an hour or two, is a &s;uccedaneum; and &s;aves the patient, if repeated once or twice according to the difficulty of the re&s;piration.</P>
<P>The chin-cough &s;eems to re&s;emble the gonorrhoea venerea in &s;everal circum&s;tances. They are both received by infection, are both di&s;|ea&s;es of the mucous membrane, are both generally cured in four or &s;ix weeks without medicine. If ulcers in the cellular membrane under the mucous membrane occur, they are of a phagedenic kind, and de&s;troy the patient in both di&s;ea&s;es, if no medicine be ad|mini&s;tered.</P>
<P>Hence the cure &s;hould be &s;imilar in both the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es; fir&s;t ge|neral evacuations and diluents, then, after a week or two, I have believed the following pills of great advantage. The do&s;e for a child of about three years old was one &s;ixth part of a grain of calomel, one &s;ixth part of a grain of opium, and two grains of rhubarb, to be taken twice a day.</P>
<P>The opium promotes ab&s;orption from the mucous membrane, and hence contributes to heal it. The mercury prevents ulcers from be|ing formed under the mucous membrane, or cures them, as in the lues venerea; and the rhubarb is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the bowels open.</P>
<P>M. M. Antimonial vomits frequently repeated. Mild cathartics. Cool air. Tincture of cantharides, or repeated bli&s;ters; afterwards opiates in &s;mall do&s;es, and the bark.

atmo&s;pheric air be of &s;ervice? Copious vene&s;ection, when a difficulty of breathing continues between the fits of coughing; otherwi&s;e the cough and the expectoration cea&s;e, and the patient is de&s;troyed. Ulcers of the lungs &s;ometimes &s;upervene, and the phthi&s;is pulmonalis in a few weeks terminates in death. Where the cough continues after &s;ome weeks without much of the hooping, and a &s;en&s;itive fever daily &s;upervenes, &s;o as to re&s;emble hectic fever from ulcers of the lungs; change of air for a week or fortnight acts as a charm, and re|&s;tores the patient beyond the hopes of the phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Young children &s;hould lie with their heads and &s;houlders rai&s;ed; and &s;hould be con&s;tantly watched day and night; that when the cough occurs, they may be held up ea&s;ily, &s;o as to &s;tand upon their feet bending a little forwards; or nicely &s;upported in that po&s;ture which they &s;eem to put them&s;elves into. A bow of whalebone, about the &s;ize of the bow of a key, is very u&s;eful to extract the phlegm out of the mouths of infants at the time of their coughing; as an handkerchief, if applied at the time of their quick in&s;pirations after long holding their breath, is dangerous, and may &s;uffocate the patient in an in&s;tant, as I believe has &s;ometimes happened.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Variola di&s;creta.</HI> The &s;mall-pox is well divided by Sydenham into di&s;tinct and confluent. The former con&s;i&s;ts of di&s;tinct pu&s;tules, which appear on the fourth day of the fever, are circum&s;cribed and turgid; the fever cea&s;ing when the eruption is complete. Headach, pain in the loins, vomiting frequently, and convul&s;ive fits &s;ometimes, precede the eruption.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox is attended with &s;en&s;itive fever only, when very mild, as in mo&s;t inoculated patients; or with &s;en&s;itive irritated fever, when the di&s;ea&s;e is greater: the danger in this kind of &s;mall|pox is owing either to the tumor and &s;orene&s;s of the throat about the height, or eighth day of the eruption; or to the violence of the &s;e|condary fever. For, fir&s;t, as the natural di&s;ea&s;e is generally taken
<PB N="237" REF="2470">
by particles of the du&s;t of the contagious matter dried and floating in the air, the&s;e are liable to be arre&s;ted by the mucus about the throat and ton&s;ils in their pa&s;&s;age to the lungs, or to the &s;tomach, when they are previou&s;ly mixed with &s;aliva in the mouth. Hence the throat inflames like the arm in inoculated patients; and this increa&s;ing, as the di&s;ea&s;e advances, de&s;troys the patient about the height.</P>
<P>Secondly, all tho&s;e upon the face and head come out about the &s;ame time, namely, about one day before tho&s;e on the hands, and two before tho&s;e in the trunk; and thence, when the head is very full, a danger ari&s;es from the &s;econdary fever, which is a purulent, not a variolous fever; for as the matter from all the&s;e of the face and head is reab&s;orbed at the &s;ame time, the patient is de&s;troyed by the violence of this purulent fever; which in the di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox can only be abated by vene&s;ection and cathartics; but in the confluent &s;mall-pox requires cordials and opiates, as it is attended with arterial debility. See Sect. XXXV. 1. and XXXIII. 2. 10.</P>
<P>When the pu&s;tules on the face recede, the face &s;wells; and when tho&s;e of the hands recede, the hands &s;well; and the &s;ame of the feet in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The&s;e &s;wellings &s;eem to be owing to the ab&s;orption of variolous matter, which by its &s;timulus excites the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els to &s;ecrete more lymph, or &s;erum, or mucus, exactly as hap|pens by the &s;timulus of a bli&s;ter. Now, as a bli&s;ter &s;ometimes pro|duces &s;trangury many hours after it has ri&s;en; it is plain, that a part of the cantharides is ab&s;orbed, and carried to the neck of the blad|der; whether it enters the circulation, or is carried thither by retro|grade movements of the urinary branch of lymphatics; and by parity of rea&s;oning the variolous matter is ab&s;orbed, and &s;wells the face and hands by its &s;timulus.</P>

continuing after the eruption is complete; convul&s;ions do not pre|cede this kind of &s;mall-pox, and are &s;o far to be e&s;teemed a favourable &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>The confluent &s;mall-pox is attended with &s;en&s;itive inirritated fever, or inflammation with arterial debility; whence the danger of this di&s;ea&s;e is owing to the general tendency to gangrene, with petechiae, or purple &s;pots, and haemorrhages; be&s;ides the two &s;ources of danger from the tumor of the throat about the height, or eleventh day of the eruption, and the purulent fever after that time; which are ge|nerally much more to be dreaded in this than in the di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox de&s;cribed above.</P>
<P>M. M. The method of treatment mu&s;t vary with the degree and kind of fever. Vene&s;ection may be u&s;ed in the di&s;tinct &s;mall|pox early in the di&s;ea&s;e, according to the &s;trength or hardne&s;s of the pul&s;e; and perhaps on the fir&s;t day of the confluent &s;mall-pox, and even of the plague, before the &s;en&s;orial power is exhau&s;ted by the violence of the arterial action? Cold air, and even wa&s;hing or bath|ing in cold water, is a powerful means in perhaps all eruptive di&s;ea&s;es attended with fever; as the quantity of eruption depends on the quantity of the fever, and the activity of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els; which may be judged of by the heat produced on the &s;kin; and which latter is immediately abated by expo&s;ure to external cold. Mercurial purges, as three grains of calomel repeated every day during the eruptive fever, &s;o as to induce three or four &s;tools, contribute to abate in|flammation; and is believed by &s;ome to have a &s;pecific effect on the variolous, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have on the venereal contagion.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that opening the pock and taking out the matter has not abated the &s;econdary fever; but as I had conceived, that the pits, or marks left after the &s;mall-pox, were owing to the acri|mony of the matter beneath the hard &s;cabs, which not being able to exhale eroded the &s;kin, and produced ulcers, I directed the faces of
<PB N="239" REF="2490">
two patients in the confluent &s;mall-pox to be covered with cerate early in the di&s;ea&s;e, which was daily renewed; and I was induced to think, that they had much le&s;s of the &s;econdary fever, and were &s;o little marked, that one of them, who was a young lady, almo&s;t en|tirely pre&s;erved her beauty. Perhaps mercurial pla&s;ters, or cerates, made without turpentine in them, might have been more efficacious in preventing the marks, and e&s;pecially if applied early in the di&s;ea&s;e, even on the fir&s;t day of the eruption, and renewed daily. For it ap|pears from the experiments of Van Woen&s;el, that calomel or &s;ubli|mate corro&s;ive, triturated with variolous matter, incapacitates it from giving the di&s;ea&s;e by inoculation. Calomel or &s;ublimate given as an alterative for ten days before inoculation, and till the eruptive fever commences, is &s;aid with certainty to render the di&s;ea&s;e mild by the &s;ame author. Exper. on Mercury by Van Woen&s;el, tran&s;lated by Dr. Fowle, Sali&s;bury.</P>
<P><HI>Variola inoculata.</HI> The world is much indebted to the great di&s;|coverer of the good effects of inoculation, who&s;e name is unknown; and our own country to Lady Wortley Montague for its intro|duction into this part of Europe. By in&s;erting the variolous conta|gion into the arm, it is not received by the ton&s;ils, as generally happens, I &s;uppo&s;e, in the natural &s;mall-pox; whence there is no dangerous &s;welling of the throat, and as the pu&s;tules are generally few and di&s;tinct, there is &s;eldom any &s;econdary fever; whence tho&s;e two &s;ources of danger are precluded; hence when the throat in inoculated &s;mall-pox is much inflamed and &s;welled, there is rea&s;on to believe, that the di&s;ea&s;e had been previou&s;ly taken by the ton&s;ils in the natural way.&mdash;Which al&s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, has generally happened, where the confluent kind of &s;mall-pox has occurred on inoculation.</P>
<P>I have known two in&s;tances, and have heard of others, where the natural &s;mall-pox began fourteen days after the contagion had been received; one of the&s;e in&s;tances was of a countryman, who went to a market town many miles from his home, where he &s;aw a per&s;on
<PB N="240" REF="2500">
in the &s;mall-pox, and on returning the fever commenced that day fortnight: the other was of a child, whom the ignorant mother carried to another child ill of the &s;mall-pox, on purpo&s;e to communi|cate the di&s;ea&s;e to it; and the variolous fever began on the fourteenth day from that time. So that in both the&s;e ca&s;es fever commenced in half a lunation after the contagion was received. In the inoculated &s;mall-pox the fever generally commences on the &s;eventh day, or after a quarter of a lunation; and on this circum&s;tance probably depends the greater mildne&s;s of the latter. The rea&s;on of which is difficult to comprehend; but &s;uppo&s;ing the facts to be generally as above re|lated, the &s;lower progre&s;s of the contagion indicates a greater inirri|tability of the &s;y&s;tem, and in con&s;equence a tendency to malignant rather than to inflammatory fever. This difference of the time be|tween the reception of the infection and the fever in the natural and artificial &s;mall-pox may neverthele&s;s depend on its being in&s;erted into a different &s;eries of ve&s;&s;els; or to &s;ome unknown effect of lunar pe|riods. It is a &s;ubject of great curio&s;ity, and de&s;erves further in|ve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>When the inoculated &s;mall-pox is given under all the mo&s;t favour|able circum&s;tances I believe le&s;s than one in a thou&s;and mi&s;carry, which may be a&s;cribed to &s;ome unavoidable a$cident, &s;uch as the patient having previou&s;ly received the infection, or being about to be ill of &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e. Tho&s;e which have lately mi&s;carried under inoculation, as far as has come to my knowledge, have been chiefly children at the brea&s;t; for in the&s;e the habit of living in the air has been confirmed by &s;o &s;hort a time, that it is much ea&s;ier de&s;troyed, than when the&s;e habits of life have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by more frequent repetition. See Sect. XVII. 3. Thus it appears from the bills of mortality kept in the great cities of London, Paris, and Vienna, that out of every thou&s;and children above three hundred and fifty die under two years old. (Kirkpatrick on Inoculation.) Whence a &s;trong rea&s;on again&s;t our hazarding inoculation before that age is pa&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="241" REF="2510">
e&s;pecially in crowded towns; except where the vicinity of the natural contagion renders it nece&s;&s;ary, or the convenience of inoculating a whole family at a time; as it then becomes better to venture the le&s;s favourable circum&s;tances of the age of the patient, or the chance of the pain from toothing, than to ri&s;k the infection in the natural way.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t favourable method con&s;i&s;ts in, fir&s;t, for a week before inoculation, re&s;training the patients from all kinds of fermented or &s;pirituous liquor, and from animal food; and by giving them from one grain to three or four of calomel every other day for three times. But if the patients be in any the lea&s;t danger of taking the natural in|fection, the inoculation had better be immediately performed, and this ab&s;tinence then began; and two or three gentle purges with ca|lomel &s;hould be given, one immediately, and on alternate days. The&s;e cathartics &s;hould not induce more than two or three &s;tools. I have &s;een two in&s;tances of a confluent &s;mall-pox in inoculation following a violent purging induced by too large a do&s;e of calomel.</P>
<P>Secondly, the matter u&s;ed for inoculation &s;hould be in a &s;mall quantity, and warm, and fluid. Hence it is be&s;t when it can be recently taken from a patient in the di&s;ea&s;e; or otherwi&s;e it may be diluted with part of a drop of warm water, &s;ince its fluidity is likely to occa&s;ion its immediate ab&s;orption; and the wound &s;hould be made as &s;mall and &s;uperficial as po&s;&s;ible, as otherwi&s;e ulcers have been &s;up|po&s;ed &s;ometimes to en&s;ue with &s;ubaxillary ab&s;ce&s;&s;es. Add to this, that the making two punctures either on the &s;ame, or one on each arm, &s;ecures the &s;ucce&s;s of the operation in re&s;pect to communicating the infection.</P>
<P>Thirdly, at the time of the fever or eruption the application of cool air to tho&s;e parts of the &s;kin, which are too warm, or appear red, or are covered with what is termed a ra&s;h, &s;hould be u&s;ed freely, as well as during the whole di&s;ea&s;e. And at the &s;ame time, if the feet or
<PB N="242" REF="2520">
hands are colder than natural, the&s;e &s;hould be covered with flannel. See Cla&s;s IV. 2. 2. 10.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Rubeola irritata, morbilli.</HI> The mea&s;les commence with &s;neezing, red eyes, dry hoar&s;e cough, and is attended with &s;en&s;itive irritated fever. On the fourth day, or a little later, &s;mall thick eruptions appear, &s;carcely eminent above the &s;kin, and, after three days, changing into very &s;mall branny &s;cales.</P>
<P>As the contagious material of the &s;mall-pox may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be diffu&s;ed in the air like a fine dry powder, and mixing with the &s;aliva in the mouth to infect the ton&s;ils in its pa&s;&s;age to the &s;tomach; &s;o the contagious material of the mea&s;les may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be more completely di&s;&s;olved in the air, and thus to impart its poi&s;on to the membrane of the no&s;trils, which covers the &s;en&s;e of &s;mell; whence a catarrh with &s;neezing u&s;hers in the fever; the termination of the na&s;al duct of the lacrymal &s;ac is &s;ubject to the &s;ame &s;timulus and in|flammation, and affects by &s;ympathy the lacrymal glands, occa&s;ioning a great flow of tears. See Sect. XVI. 8. And the redne&s;s of the eye and eyelids is produced in con&s;equence of the tears being in &s;o great quantity, that the &s;aline part of them is not entirely reab&s;orbed. See Sect. XXIV. 2. 8.</P>
<P>The contagion of the mea&s;les, if it be taken a &s;ufficient time be|fore inoculation, &s;o that the eruption may commence before the va|riolous fever comes on, &s;tops the progre&s;s of the &s;mall-pox in the inoculated wound, and delays it till the mea&s;le-fever has fini&s;hed its career. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 9.</P>
<P>The mea&s;les are u&s;ually attended with inflammatory fever with &s;trong pul&s;e, and bear the lancet in every &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e. In the early periods of it, vene&s;ection renders the fever and cough le&s;s; and, if any &s;ymptoms of peripneumony occur, is repeatedly nece&s;&s;ary; and at the decline of the di&s;ea&s;e, if a cough be left after the eruption

has cea&s;ed, and the &s;ub&s;equent branny &s;cales are falling off, vene|&s;ection &s;hould be immediately u&s;ed; which prevents the danger of con&s;umption. At this time al&s;o change of air is of material con&s;e|quence, and often removes the cough like a charm, as mentioned in a &s;imilar &s;ituation at the end of the chin-cough.</P>
<P><HI>Rubeola inirritata.</HI> Mea&s;les with inirritated fever, or with weak pul&s;e, has been &s;poken of by &s;ome writers. See London Med. Ob|&s;erv. Vol. IV. Art. XI. It has al&s;o been &s;aid to have been attended with &s;ore throat. Edinb. E&s;&s;ays, Vol. V. Art. II. Could the &s;carlet fever have been mi&s;taken for the mea&s;les? or might one of them have &s;ucceeded the other, as in the mea&s;les and &s;mall-pox mentioned in Sect. XXXIII. 2. 9.?</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it is probable that inoculation might di&s;arm the mea&s;les as much as the &s;mall-pox, by preventing the catarrh, and frequent pulmonary inflammation, which attends this di&s;ea&s;e; both of which are probably the con&s;equence of the imme|diate application of the contagious mia&s;mata to the&s;e membranes. Some attempts have been made, but a difficulty &s;eems to ari&s;e in giving the di&s;ea&s;e; the blood, I conjecture, would not infect, nor the tears; perhaps the mucous di&s;charge from the no&s;trils might &s;uc|ceed; or a drop of warm water put on the eruptions, and &s;craped off again with the edge of a lancet; or if the branny &s;cales were col|lected, and moi&s;tened with a little warm water? Further experiments on this &s;ubject would be worthy the public attention.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Scarlatina mitis.</HI> The &s;carlet fever exi&s;ts with all degrees of virulence, from a flea-bite to the plague. The infectious material of this di&s;ea&s;e, like that of the &s;mall-pox, I &s;uppo&s;e to be diffu&s;ed, not di&s;&s;olved, in the air; on which account I &s;u&s;pect, that it re|quires a much nearer approach to the &s;ick, for a well per&s;on to receive the infection, than in the mea&s;les; the contagion of which I believe to be more volatile, or diffu&s;ible in the atmo&s;phere. But as the
<PB N="244" REF="2540">
contagious mia&s;mata of &s;mall-pox and &s;carlet fever are &s;uppo&s;ed to be more fixed, they may remain for a longer time in clothes or furni|ture; as a thread dipped in variolous matter has given the di&s;ea&s;e by inoculation after having been expo&s;ed many days to the air, and after having been kept many months in a phial. This al&s;o accounts for the &s;low or &s;poradic progre&s;s of the &s;carlet fever, as it infects others at but a very &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;ick; and does not produce a quantity of pus-like matter, like the &s;mall-pox, which can adhere to the clothes of the attendants, and when dried is liable to be &s;hook off in the form of powder, and thus propagate the infection.</P>
<P>This contagious powder of the &s;mall-pox, and of the &s;carlet fever, becomes mixed with &s;aliva in the mouth, and is thus carried to the ton&s;ils, the mucus of which arre&s;ts &s;ome particles of this deleterious material; while other parts of it are carried into the &s;tomach, and are probably decompo&s;ed by the power of dige&s;tion; as &s;eems to happen to the venom of the viper, when taken into the &s;tomach. Our perception of bad ta&s;tes in our mouths, at the &s;ame time that we perceive di&s;agreeable odours to our no&s;trils, when we inhale very bad air, occa&s;ions us to &s;pit out our &s;aliva; and thus, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to pre&s;erve our&s;elves from infection. This has been &s;uppo&s;ed to ori|ginate from the &s;ympathy between the organs of ta&s;te and &s;mell; but any one who goes into a &s;ick room clo&s;e &s;hut up, or into a crowded a&s;&s;embly-room, or tea-room, which is not &s;ufficiently ventilated, may ea&s;ily mix the bad air with the &s;aliva on his tongue &s;o as to ta&s;te it; as I have my&s;elf frequently attended to.</P>
<P>Hence it appears that the&s;e heavy infectious matters are more liable to mix with the &s;aliva, and inflame the ton&s;ils, and that either before or at the commencement of the fever; and this is what generally happens in the &s;carlet fever, always I &s;uppo&s;e in the malignant kind, and very frequently in the mild kind. But as this infection may be taken by other means, as by the &s;kin, it al&s;o happens in the mo&s;t mild kind, that there is no inflammation of the ton&s;ils at all; in the
<PB N="245" REF="2550">
&s;ame manner as there is generally no inflammation of the ton&s;ils in the inoculated &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>In the mild &s;carlatina on the fourth day of the fever the face &s;wells a little, at the &s;ame time a florid redne&s;s appears on various parts of the &s;kin, in large blotches, at length coale&s;cing, and after three days changing into branny &s;cales.</P>

<P><HI>Scarlatina maligna.</HI> The malignant &s;carlet fever begins with in|flamed ton&s;ils; which are &s;ucceeded by dark drab-coloured &s;loughs three or five lines in diameter, flat, or beneath the &s;urrounding &s;ur|face; and which conceal beneath them &s;preading gangrenous ulcers. The &s;wellings of the ton&s;ils are &s;en&s;ible to the eye and touch exter|nally, and have an ela&s;tic rather than an oedematous feel, like parts in the vicinity of gangrenes. The pul&s;e is very quick and weak, with delirium, and the patient generally dies in a few days; or if he re|covers, it is by &s;low degrees, and attended with ana&s;arca.</P>

Touch the ulcers with a dry &s;ponge to ab&s;orb the contagious matter, and then with a &s;ponge filled with vinegar, with or without &s;ugar of lead di&s;&s;olved in it, about &s;ix grains to an ounce; or with a very little blue vitriol di&s;&s;olved in it, as a grain to an ounce; but nothing &s;o in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly corrects the putrid &s;mell of ulcers as a &s;olution of alum, about half an ounce to a pint of water, which &s;hould be a little warmi&s;h, and injected into the fauces gently by means of a &s;yringe. The&s;e &s;hould be repeated frequently in a day, if it can be done ea&s;ily, and without fatigue to the child.

Could oxygene gas mixed with common air &s;timulate the languid &s;y&s;tem? Small electric &s;hocks through the ton&s;ils every hour? ether frequently applied externally to the &s;welled ton&s;ils?</P>
<P>As this di&s;ea&s;e is attended with the greate&s;t degree of debility, and as &s;timulant medicines, if given in quantity, &s;o as to produce more than natural warmth, contribute to expend the already too much ex|hau&s;ted &s;en&s;orial power; it appears, that there is nothing &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary to be nicely attended to, as to prevent any unnece&s;&s;ary motions of the &s;y&s;tem; this is be&s;t accompli&s;hed by the application of cold to tho&s;e parts of the &s;kin, which are in the lea&s;t too hot. And &s;econdly, that the exhibition of the bark in &s;uch quantity, as not to oppre&s;s the &s;tomach and injure dige&s;tion, is next to be attended to, as not being liable to increa&s;e the actions of the &s;y&s;tem beyond their natural quan|tity; and that opium and wine &s;hould be given with the greate&s;t cau|tion, in very &s;mall repeated quantity, and &s;o managed as to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, the cold fits of fever; which probably occur twice in 25 hours, obeying the lunations like the tides, as mentioned in Sect. XXXII. 6. that is, I &s;uppo&s;e, the cold periods, and con&s;equent ex|acerbations of fever, in this malignant &s;carlatina, occur twice in a lunar day; which is about ten minutes le&s;s than 25 hours; &s;o that if the commencement of one cold fit be marked, the commencement of the next may be expected, if not di&s;turbed by the exhibition of wine or opium, or the application of bli&s;ters, to occur in about twelve hours and a half from the commencement of the former; or if not prevented by large do&s;es of the bark.</P>
<P>No one could do an act more beneficial to &s;ociety, or glorious to him&s;elf, than by teaching mankind how to inoculate this fatal di&s;|ea&s;e; and thus to deprive it of its malignity. Matter might be taken from the ulcers in the throat, which would probably convey the con|tagion. Or warm water might be put on the eruption, and &s;craped
<PB N="247" REF="2570">
off again by the edge of a lancet. The&s;e experiments could be attend|ed with no danger, and &s;hould be tried for the public benefit, and the honour of medical &s;cience.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Miliaria.</HI> Miliary fever. An eruption produced by the warmth, and more particularly by the &s;timulus of the points of the wool in flannel or blankets applied to the &s;kin, has been frequently ob&s;erved; which, by cool dre&s;s, and bed-clothes without flannel, has &s;oon cea&s;ed. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 3. This, which may be called <HI>mili|aria &s;udatoria,</HI> has been confounded with other miliary fevers, and has made the exi&s;tence of the latter doubted. Two kinds of eruptions I have &s;een formerly attended with fever, but did not &s;ufficiently mark their progre&s;s, which I conceived to be miliary eruptions, one with arterial &s;trength, or with &s;en&s;itive irritated fever, and the other with arterial debility, or with &s;en&s;itive inirritated fever.</P>
<P>In the former of the&s;e, or <HI>miliaria irritata,</HI> the eruptions were di&s;tinct and larger than the &s;mall-pox, and the fever was not &s;ub|dued without two or three vene&s;ections, and repeated cathartics with calomel.</P>
<P>The latter, or <HI>miliaria inirritata,</HI> was attended with great arterial debility; and during the cour&s;e of the fever pellucid points appeared within the &s;kin, particularly on the &s;oft parts of the fingers. And, in one patient, whom I e&s;teemed near her end, I well recollect to have ob&s;erved round pellucid globules, like what are often &s;een on vines in hot-hou&s;es, no larger than the &s;malle&s;t pins' heads, adhere to her neck and bo&s;om; which were hard to the touch, but were ea&s;ily rubbed off. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, if they are allied, do not differ more than the kinds of &s;mall-pox; but require many further ob&s;er|vations.</P>
<P>The eruption &s;o often &s;een on children in the cradle, and called by the nur&s;es red-gum, and which is attended with &s;ome degree of fever, I &s;u&s;pect to be produced by too great warmth, and the contact of flannel

<P N="13">13. <HI>Pe&s;tis.</HI> The plague, like other di&s;ea&s;es of this cla&s;s, &s;eems to be &s;ometimes mild, and &s;ometimes malignant; according to the te&s;|timony of different writers. It is &s;aid to be attended with inflamma|tion, with the greate&s;t arterial debility, and to be very contagious, attended at an uncertain time of the fever with buboes and carbuncles. Some authors affirm, that the contagion of the plague may be re|peatedly received, &s;o as to produce the di&s;ea&s;e; but as this is contrary to the general analogy of all contagious di&s;ea&s;es, which are attended with fever, and which cure them&s;elves &s;pontaneou&s;ly; there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that where it has been &s;uppo&s;ed to have been repeatedly received, that &s;ome other fever with arterial debility has been mi&s;|taken for it, as has probably univer&s;ally been the ca&s;e, when the &s;mall-pox has been &s;aid to have been twice experienced.</P>
<P>M. M. Vene&s;ection has been recommended by &s;ome writers on the fir&s;t day, where the inflammation was &s;uppo&s;ed to be attended with &s;ufficient arterial &s;trength, which might perhaps &s;ometimes happen, as the bubo &s;eems to be a &s;uppuration; but the carbuncle, or anthrax, is a gangrene of the part, and &s;hews the greate&s;t debility of circu|lation. Whence all the means before enumerated in this genus of di&s;ea&s;es to &s;upport the powers of life are to be admini&s;tered. Cur|rents of cold air, cold water, ice, externally on the hot parts of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>The methods of preventing the &s;preading of this di&s;ea&s;e have been much canva&s;&s;ed, and &s;eem to con&s;i&s;t in preventing all congregations of the people, as in churches, or play-hou&s;es; and to remove the &s;ick into tents on &s;ome airy common by the &s;ide of a river, and &s;upply them with fre&s;h food, both animal and vegetable, with beer and wine in proper quantities, and to encourage tho&s;e who can, daily to wa&s;h both their clothes and them&s;elves.</P>

The <HI>peftis vaccina,</HI> or di&s;ea&s;e among&s;t the cows, which afflicted this i&s;land about half a century ago, &s;eems to have been a contagious fever with great arterial debility; as in &s;ome of them in the latter &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, an emphy&s;ema could often be felt in &s;ome parts, which evinced a con&s;iderable progre&s;s of gangrene beneath the &s;kin. In the &s;en&s;itive inirritated fevers of the&s;e animals, I &s;uppo&s;e about &s;ixty grains of opium, with two ounces of extract of oak-bark, every &s;ix hours, would &s;upply them with an efficacious medicine; to which might be added thirty grains of vitriol of iron, if any tendency to bloody urine &s;hould appear, to which this animal is liable. The me|thod of preventing the infection from &s;preading, if it &s;hould ever again gain acce&s;s to this i&s;land, would be immediately to obtain an order from government to prevent any cattle from being removed, which were found within five miles of the place &s;uppo&s;ed to be in|fected, for a few days; till the certainty of the exi&s;tence of the pe&s;|tilence could be a&s;certained, by a committee of medical people. As &s;oon as this was a&s;certained, all the cattle within five miles of the place &s;hould be immediately &s;laughtered, and con&s;umed within the circum&s;cribed di&s;trict; and their hides put into lime-water before pro|per in&s;pectors.</P>

They &s;eem to &s;pread downwards from the throat into the &s;tomach, and probably through the whole inte&s;tinal canal, beginning their cour&s;e with cardialgia, and terminating it with tene&s;mus; and might perhaps be called an ery&s;i|pelas of this mucous membrane.</P>
<P>M. M. Cool air. A &s;mall bli&s;ter on the back. Bark. Wine. Opium in &s;mall repeated quantities. Soap neutralizes the ga&s;tric acid without efferve&s;cence, and thus relieves the pain of cardialgia, where the &s;tomach is affected. Milk al&s;o de&s;troys a part of this acid. In|fu&s;ion of &s;age leaves two ounces, almond &s;oap from five grains to ten, with &s;ugar and cream, is generally both agreeable and u&s;eful to the&s;e patients. See I. 2. 4. 5.</P>
<P>Where the &s;tomach may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be excoriated by poi&s;ons containing acid, as &s;ublimate of mercury or ar&s;enic; or if it be other|wi&s;e inflamed, or very &s;en&s;ible to the &s;timulus of the ga&s;tric acid; or where it abounds with acid of any kind, as in cardialgia; the exhibition
<PB N="252" REF="2620">
of &s;oap is perhaps a preferable manner of giving alcali than any other, as it decompo&s;es in the &s;tomach without efferve&s;cence; while the cau&s;tic alcali is too acrid to be admini&s;tered in &s;uch ca&s;es, and the mild alcali produces carbonic gas. If a drop of acid of vitriol be put on cap paper, it will be long before it de&s;troys the paper; but if a drop of mild alcali be added, a &s;udden efferve&s;cence ari&s;es, and the paper is in&s;tantly de&s;troyed by the e&s;cape of the fixed air; in the &s;ame manner as lumps of &s;olid lime are broken into powder by the e&s;cape of the &s;team produced from the water, which is poured on them. This &s;hews why a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of acid and of alcaline cau&s;tics &s;ooner de&s;troys a part, than either of them applied &s;eparately.</P>
<P N="18">18. <HI>Dy&s;enteria.</HI> Bloody-flux is attended with &s;en&s;itive fever gene|rally with arterial debility; with frequent mucous or bloody &s;tools; which contain contagious matter produced by the membranes of the inte&s;tines; the alimentary excrement being neverthele&s;s retained; with griping pains and tene&s;mus.</P>
<P>M. M. Emetics. Antimonials. Peruvian bark. Opium and ca|lomel of each a grain every night. Bolus armeniae. Earth of alum. Chalk. Calcined hart&s;horn. Mucilage. Bee's wax mixt with yolk of egg. Cerated gla&s;s of antimony. Warm bath. Flannel clothing next to the &s;kin. Large cly&s;ters with opium. With ipecacuanha, with &s;moke of tobacco? Two dy&s;enteric patients in the &s;ame ward of the infirmary at Edinburgh quarrelled, and whipped each other with hor&s;ewhips a long time, and were both much better after it, owing perhaps to the exertion of &s;o much of the &s;en&s;orial power of volition; which, like real in&s;anity, added excitement to the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The prevention of this contagion mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t principally in ventila|tion and cleanline&s;s; hence the patients &s;hould be removed into cot|tages di&s;tant from each other, or into tents; and their faeces buried as &s;oon as may be; or conveyed into a running &s;tream; and them&s;elves
<PB N="253" REF="2630">
&s;hould be wa&s;hed with cold or warm water after every evacuation. For the contagious matter con&s;i&s;ts in the mucous or purulent di&s;|charge from the membrane which lines the inte&s;tines; and not from the febrile per&s;piration, or breath of the patients. For the fever is only the con&s;equence and not the cau&s;e of contagion; as appears from Genus the Fifth of this Order, where contagion exi&s;ts without fever.</P>
<P N="19">19. <HI>Ga&s;tritis &s;uperficialis.</HI> Superficial inflammation of the &s;tomach. An ery&s;ipelatous inflammation of the &s;tomach is mentioned by Dr. Cullen from his own ob&s;ervations; which is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the inflammatory ga&s;tritis by le&s;s pain and fever, and by an ery&s;ipelatous redne&s;s about the fauces.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">With the Production of new Ve&s;&s;els by internal Membranes or Glands, without Fever.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE inflammation is produced in a &s;mall part, which has not great natural &s;en&s;ibility, the additional &s;en&s;ation does not produce an increa&s;ed action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem; that is, the a&s;&s;ociated motions which are employed in the circulation of the blood, tho&s;e for in&s;tance of the heart, arteries, glands, capillaries, and their corre&s;pondent veins, are not thrown into increa&s;ed action by &s;o &s;mall an addition of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation. But when parts, which naturally po&s;&s;e&s;s more &s;en&s;ibility, become inflamed, the quantity of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation becomes &s;o much increa&s;ed, as to affect the a&s;&s;oci|ated motions belonging to the circulation, occa&s;ioning them to pro|ceed with greater frequency; that is, a fever is induced. This is well exemplified in the internal and &s;uperficial paronychia, one of which is attended with great pain and fever, and the other with little pain and no fever. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 19. and II. 1. 4. 5.</P>
<P>From hence it appears, that the &s;en&s;itive fever is an accidental con|&s;equence of the topical phlegmon, or inflammation, and not a cau&s;e of it; that it is often injurious, but never &s;alutary; and &s;hould there|fore always be extingui&s;hed, as &s;oon as may be, either by the lancet and cathartics, and diluents, and cold air, when it is of the irritated kind; or by the bark, opium, cool air, and nutrientia, when it is of the inirritated kind.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="255" REF="2650">
<HEAD>SPECIES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Ophthalmia &s;uperficialis.</HI> As the membranes, which cover the eye, are excluded from the air about one third part of the twenty|four hours; and are moi&s;tened by perpetual nictitation during the other &s;ixteen; they may be con&s;idered as internal membranes; and from the analogy of their inflammation to that of other internal mem|branes, it is arranged under this genus; whil&s;t the ton&s;illitis is e&s;teemed an inflammation of an external membrane, becau&s;e currents of air are perpetually pa&s;&s;ing both day and night over the fauces.</P>
<P>The &s;uperficial ophthalmy has generally been e&s;teemed a &s;ymptom of &s;crophula, when it recurs frequently in young per&s;ons; but is probably only a concomitant of that di&s;ea&s;e, as a &s;ymptom of general debility; ramifications of new red ve&s;&s;els, and of enlarged old ones, are &s;pread over the white part of the eye; and it is attended with le&s;s heat, le&s;s pain, and le&s;s intolerance of light than the ophthalmia in|terna, de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 2. It occurs in tho&s;e of feeble cir|culation, e&s;pecially children of a &s;crophulous tendency, and &s;eems to ari&s;e from a previous torpor of the ve&s;&s;els of the tunica albuginea from their being expo&s;ed to cold air; and from this torpor being more liable to occur in habits, which are naturally inirritable; and therefore more readily fall into quie&s;cence by a &s;maller deduction of the &s;timulus of heat, than would affect &s;tronger or more irritable habits; the con|&s;equence of this torpor is increa&s;ed action, which produces pain in the eye, and that induces inflammation by the acqui&s;ition of the additional &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Ophthalmia lymphatica</HI> is a kind of ana&s;arca of the tunica adnata; in this the ve&s;&s;els over the &s;clerotica, or white part of the eye, ri&s;e con&s;i|derably above the cornea, which they &s;urround, are le&s;s red than in the ophthalmia &s;uperficialis, and appear to be &s;welled by an accumulation
<PB N="256" REF="2660">
of lymph rather than of blood; it is probably owing to the temporary ob&s;truction of a branch of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>M. M. If the pain be great, vene&s;ection by leeches on the tem|ple, or cutting the temporal artery, and one purge with three or four grains of calomel &s;hould be premi&s;ed. Then the Peruvian bark twice a day. Opium from a quarter to half a grain twice a day for &s;ome weeks. Bathe the eye frequently with cold water alone, or with cold water, to a pint of which is added half an ounce of &s;alt. White vitriol &s;ix grains di&s;&s;olved in one ounce of water; a drop or two to be put between the eyelids twice a day. Take very &s;mall electric &s;parks from the eyes every day for a fortnight. Bathe the whole head with &s;alt and water made warm every night for &s;ome months. Send &s;uch children to a &s;chool near the &s;ea for the convenience of &s;ea-bath|ing for many months annually; &s;uch &s;chools are to be found in or near Liverpool.</P>
<P>When a child is afflicted with an inflamed eye of this kind, he &s;hould always &s;it with his back to the window or candle; but it is generally not nece&s;&s;ary to cover it, or if the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation of light makes this proper, the cover &s;hould &s;tand off from the eye, &s;o as not much to exclude the cool air from it. As covering an eye unnece&s;&s;a|rily is liable to make that eye weaker than the other, from its not being &s;ufficiently u&s;ed, and thence to produce a &s;quinting for ever afterwards.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, when the pain is great, a poultice mu&s;t be applied to keep the eyes moi&s;t, or a piece of oiled &s;ilk bound lightly over them. Or thus, boil an egg till it is hard, cut it longitudinally into two he|mi&s;pheres, take out the yolk, $ew the backs of the two hollow hemi&s;pheres of the white to a ribbon, and bind them over the eyes every night on going to bed; which, if nicely fitted on, will keep the eyes moi&s;t without any di&s;agreeable pre&s;&s;ure. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 14.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="2670">
<HI>Ophthalmia equina.</HI> An inflammation of this kind is liable to affect the eyes of hor&s;es; one cau&s;e of which is owing to a &s;illy cu&s;tom of cutting the hair out of hor&s;es' ears; by which they are not only liable to take cold at the ear, but gra&s;s &s;eeds are liable to fall into their ears from the high racks in &s;tables; and in both ca&s;es the eye becomes inflamed by &s;ympathy. I once directed the temporal artery of a hor&s;e to be opened, who had frequent returns of an inflamed eye; and I believed it was of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to him; it is probable that the ar|tery was afterwards contracted in the wounded part, and that thence le&s;s blood was derived to the eye: the haemorrhage was &s;topped by two per&s;ons alternately keeping their fingers on the orifice, and after|wards by a long bandage of broad tape.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Pterigion.</HI> Eye-wing. A &s;pot of inflammation &s;ometimes begins on the in&s;ide of the lower eyelid, or on the tunica albuginea, and &s;preads an intertexture of red ve&s;&s;els from it, as from a center, which extend on the white part of the eye, and have the appearance of the wing of a fly, from whence its name.</P>
<P>M. M. Cut the ramifications of ve&s;&s;els again and again with the point of a lancet clo&s;e to the center of inflammation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Tar&s;itis palpebrarum.</HI> Inflammation of the edges of the eyelids. This is a di&s;ea&s;e of the glands, which produce the hairs of the eye|la&s;hes, and is frequently the cau&s;e of their falling off. After this in|flammation a hard &s;car-like ridge is left on the edge of the eyelid, which &s;cratches and inflames the eyeball, and becomes a very trouble|&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h ladies are &s;aid to colour the edge of the eyela&s;h with crude antimony in very fine powder, which not only gives lu&s;tre to the eye, as a diamond &s;et on a black foil, but may prevent extraneous light from being reflected from the&s;e edges into the eye, and thus &s;erve the purpo&s;e of the black feathers about the eyes of &s;wans, de&s;cribed
<PB N="258" REF="2680">
in Sect. XXXIX. 5. 1. and may al&s;o prevent the edges of the eyelids from being inflamed by the frequent &s;timulus of tears on them. Black lead in fine powder might be better for all the&s;e purpo&s;es than antimony, and might be put on with a camel's hair bru&s;h.</P>
<P>M. M. Mercurial ointment &s;meared at night on the edges of the eyelids. Burnt alum &s;ixty grains, hog's grea&s;e half an ounce, well rubbed into an ointment to be &s;meared on them in the night. Cold water frequently in the day. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 8.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Hordeolum.</HI> Stye. This inflammation begins either on or near the edges of the eyelids, or in the loo&s;e &s;kin of them, and is &s;ome|times very &s;low either in coming to &s;uppuration or in di&s;per&s;ing. The &s;kin beneath the lower eyelid is the mo&s;t frequent &s;eat of this tumor, which &s;ometimes never &s;uppurates at all, but becomes an in|cy&s;ted tumor. for as this &s;kin is very loo&s;e for the purpo&s;e of admit|ting great motion to the eyelid, the ab&s;orbent power of the veins &s;eems particularly weak in this part; whence when any per&s;on is weakened by fatigue or otherwi&s;e, a darker &s;hade of colour is &s;een beneath the eyes; which is owing to a le&s;s energetic action of the ab|&s;orbent terminations of the veins, whence the currents of dark or venous blood are delayed in them. This dark &s;hade beneath the eyes, when it is permanent, is a &s;ymptom of habitual debility, or inirritabi|lity of the circulating &s;y&s;tem. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 2.</P>
<P>M. M. Smear the tumors with mercurial ointment, moi&s;ten them frequently with ether. To promote their &s;uppuration they may be wounded with a lancet, or &s;lit down the middle, or they may be cut out. A cau&s;tic leaves a large &s;car.</P>
<P><HI>Paronychia &s;uperficialis.</HI> Whitlow. An inflammation about the roots of the nail beneath the &s;kin, which &s;uppurates without fever, and &s;ometimes de&s;troys the nail; which is however gradually reproduced.
<PB N="259" REF="2690">
This kind of ab&s;ce&s;s, though not it&s;elf dangerous, has given opportunity for the inoculation of venereal matter in the hands of ac|coucheurs, and of putrid matter from the di&s;&s;ection of di&s;ea&s;ed bodies; and has thus been the cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e and death. When putrid matter has been thus ab&s;orbed from a dead body, a livid line from the finger to the &s;welled gland in the axilla is &s;aid to be vi&s;ible; which &s;hews the inflammation of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;el along its whole cour&s;e to the lymphatic gland; and death has generally been the con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>M. M. In the common paronychia a poultice is generally &s;uffici|ent. In the ab&s;orption of putrid matter rub the whole hand and arm with mercurial ointment three or four times a day, or perpetually. Could the &s;welled axillary gland be ex&s;ected? In the ab&s;orption of venereal matter the u&s;ual methods of cure in &s;yphilis mu&s;t be admi|ni&s;tered, as in Cla&s;s II. 1. 5. 1.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Gutta ro&s;ea.</HI> The ro&s;y drop on the face is of three kinds. Fir&s;t, the <HI>gutta ro&s;ea hepatica,</HI> or the red pimples on the faces of drunkards, which are probably a kind of cri&s;is, or vicarious inflam|mation, which &s;ucceeds, or prevents, a torpor of the membranes of the liver. This and the &s;ucceeding &s;pecies properly belong to Cla&s;s IV. 1. 2. 14.</P>
<P>Secondly, the pimpled face in con&s;equence of drinking cold water, or eating cold turnips, or other in&s;ipid food, when much heated with exerci&s;e; which probably ari&s;es from the &s;ympathy between the &s;kin of the face and the &s;tomach; and may be called the <HI>gutta ro&s;ea &s;toma|tica.</HI> Which is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the former by the habits of the patient in re&s;pect to drinking; by the colour of the eruptions being le&s;s deep; and by the patient continuing generally to be troubled with &s;ome degree of apep&s;ia. See Cla&s;s I. 3. 1. 3. I knew a lady, who had long been afflicted with pain about the region of the &s;tomach; and, on drinking half a pint of vinegar, as a medicine, &s;he had a breaking
<PB N="260" REF="2700">
out commenced on her face; which remained, and &s;he became free from the pain about the &s;tomach. Was this a &s;tomachic, or an hepa|tic di&s;ea&s;e?</P>
<P>Thirdly, there is a red face, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;maller pimples than tho&s;e above mentioned; and which is le&s;s liable to &s;uppurate; and which &s;eems to be hereditary, or at lea&s;t has no apparent cau&s;e like tho&s;e above mentioned; which may be termed <HI>gutta ro&s;ea here|ditaria,</HI> or puncta ro&s;ea.</P>
<P>Mrs. S. had a pimpled face, which I believe aro&s;e from potation of ale. She applied alum in a poultice to it, and had &s;oon a paralytic &s;troke, which di&s;abled her on one &s;ide, and terminated in her death.</P>
<P>Mrs. L. had a red pimpled face, which &s;eemed to have been de|rived from her mother, who had probably acquired it by vinous po|tation; &s;he applied a quack remedy to it, which I believe was a &s;o|lution of lead, and was &s;eized with epileptic fits, which terminated in pal&s;y, and de&s;troyed her. This &s;hews the danger of u&s;ing white paint on the face, which is called bi&s;muth, but is in reality white lead or ceru&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>Mr. Y&mdash;had acquired the gutta ro&s;ea on his no&s;e, and applied a &s;aturnine &s;olution on it for a few nights, and was then &s;eized with paraly&s;is on one &s;ide of his face; which however he gradually re|covered, and has &s;ince acquired the gutta ro&s;ea on other parts of his face.</P>
<P>The&s;e fatal effects were probably cau&s;ed by the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;a|tion of an inflamed liver, which u&s;ed before to be relieved of the &s;ympathetic action and con&s;equent inflammation of the &s;kin of the face, which was now prevented by the &s;tronger &s;timulus of the appli|cation of calx of lead. The manner in which di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;a|tions induce epilep&s;y and pal&s;y is treated of in Cla&s;s III. In &s;ome ca&s;es where habitual di&s;charges, or eruptions, or ulcers are &s;top|ped, a torpor of the &s;y&s;tem may follow, owing to the want of the
<PB N="261" REF="2710">
accu&s;tomed quantity of &s;en&s;ation or irritation. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 9. and II. 1. 5. 6. In both the&s;e &s;ituations &s;ome other &s;timulus &s;hould be u&s;ed to &s;upply the place of that which is taken away; which may either be perpetual, as an i&s;&s;ue; or periodical, as a cathartic repeated once a fortnight or month.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s W. an elegant young lady of about twenty, applied a mer|curial lotion to her face, which was covered with very &s;mall red points; which &s;eemed to have been not acquired by any known or avoidable means; &s;he was &s;eized with inflammation of her liver, and after repeated bleeding and cathartics recovered, and in a few weeks the eruption appeared as before.</P>
<P>M. M. Five grains of calomel once a month, with a cathartic, five grains of rhubarb and a quarter of a grain of emetic tartar every night for many weeks. With this preparation mercurial pla&s;ters, made without turpentine, and applied every night, and taken off every morning, will &s;ometimes &s;ucceed, and may be u&s;ed with &s;afety. But bli&s;tering the face all over the eruption, beginning with a part, &s;ucceeds better than any other means, as I have more than once experienced.&mdash;Something like this is mentioned in the Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague, who bli&s;tered her face with bal&s;am of Mecca.</P>
<P>Mrs. F. had for many years had a di&s;agreeably looking eruption on her chin, after a cathartic with calomel, &s;he was advi&s;ed to bli&s;ter her whole chin; on the healing of the bli&s;ter a few eruptions again ap|peared, which cea&s;ed on the application of a &s;econd bli&s;ter. She took rhubarb five grains, and emetic tartar a quarter of a grain every night for many weeks.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s L. a young lady about eighteen, had tried variety of advice for pimples over the greate&s;t part of her face in vain. She took the above medicines internally, and bli&s;tered her face by degrees all over and became quite beautiful. A &s;pot or two now and then appeared, and on this account &s;he frequently &s;lept with parts of her face covered
<PB N="262" REF="2720">
with mercurial pla&s;ter, made without turpentine, which was held on by a pa&s;teboard ma&s;k, and taken off in the mornings; if any part of the pla&s;ter adhered, a little butter or oil de&s;troyed the adhe&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Odontitis.</HI> Inflammatory tooth-ach is occa&s;ioned by inflamma|tion of the membranes of the tooth, or a caries of the bone it&s;elf. The gum &s;ometimes &s;uppurates, otherwi&s;e a &s;welling of the cheek &s;ucceeds by a&s;&s;ociation, and thus the violence of the pain in the membranes of the tooth is relieved, and frequently cured; and when this happens the di&s;ea&s;e properly belongs to Cla&s;s IV. as it &s;o far re&s;embles the tran&s;lations of morbid actions in the gout and rheuma|ti&s;m.</P>
<P>At other times the tooth dies without caries, e&s;pecially in people about &s;ixty years of age, or before; and then it &s;timulates its in|volving membrane, like any other extraneous &s;ub&s;tance. The mem|brane then becomes inflamed and thickened, occa&s;ioning &s;ome pain, and the tooth ri&s;es upwards above the re&s;t, and is gradually pu&s;hed out whole and undecayed; on its ri&s;ing up a pus-like mucus is &s;een di&s;charged from the gum, which &s;urrounds it; and the gum &s;eems to have left the tooth, as the fangs or roots of it are in part naked.</P>
<P>M. M. Where the tooth is &s;ound it can only be &s;aved by evacu|ations by vene&s;ection, and a cathartic; and after its operation two grains of opium, a bli&s;ter may al&s;o be u&s;ed behind the ear, and ether applied to the cheek externally. In &s;lighter ca&s;es two grains of opium with or without as much camphor may be held in the mouth, and &s;uffered to di&s;&s;olve near the affected tooth, and be gradually &s;wallow|ed. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 4. 12. Odontalgia may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from otitis by the application of cold water to the affected tooth; for as the pain of common tooth-ach is owing to torpor, whatever decrea&s;es &s;timulus adds to the torpor and con&s;equent pain; whereas the pain of an inflamed tooth being cea&s;ed by the increa&s;ed action of the
<PB N="263" REF="2730">
membranes of it is in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviated by the application of cold.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Otitis.</HI> Inflammation and con&s;equent &s;uppuration of &s;ome mem|branes of the internal ear frequently occur in children, who &s;leep in cold rooms, or near a cold wall, without a night-cap. If the bones are affected, they come out in a long proce&s;s of time, and the child remains deaf of that ear. But in this ca&s;e there is generally a fever attends this inflammation; and it then belongs to another genus.</P>
<P>M. M. A warmer night-cap.

A bit of cotton wool applied to the fundament to receive the matter, and renewed twice a day for a week or two, &s;hould always be u&s;ed before examination with the probe. The probe of an un&s;kilful empyric &s;ometimes does more harm in the loo&s;e cellular membrane of the&s;e parts than the original ulcer, by making a fi&s;tula he did not find. The cure of a fi&s;tula in ano of tho&s;e, who have been much addicted to drinking &s;pirituous liquor, or who have a tendency to pulmonary con&s;umption, is fre|quently of dangerous con&s;equence, and is &s;ucceeded by ulcers of the lungs, and death.</P>

A French &s;urgeon has lately affirmed, that a wire of lead put in at the external opening of the ulcer, and brought through the rectum, and twi&s;ted together, will gradually wear it&s;elf through the gut, and thus effect a cure without much pain.

<P>M. M. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 21.

<P>A poor boy, about twelve years old, had a large &s;crophulous ulcer on one &s;ide of the che&s;t beneath the clavicle, and another under his jaw; he was directed, about three weeks ago, to procure a pound of dry oak-bark from the tanners, and to reduce it to fine powder, and to add to it one ounce of white lead in fine powder, and to cover the ulcers daily with it, keeping it on by brown paper and a bandage. He came to me a few minutes ago, to &s;hew me that both the ulcers are quite healed.

Another termination of &s;cir|rhus is in cancer, as de&s;cribed below. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 22.</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Carcinoma.</HI> Cancer. When a &s;chirrous tumor regains its &s;en&s;ibi|lity by nature, or by any accidental hurt, new ve&s;&s;els &s;hoot among&s;t the yet in&s;en&s;ible parts of it, and a new &s;ecretion takes place of a very injurious material.

<P>This cancerous matter does not &s;eem to acquire its malignant or contagious quality, till the cancer becomes an open ulcer; and the matter &s;ecreted in it is thus expo&s;ed to the air. Then it evidently becomes contagious, becau&s;e it not only produces hectic fever, like common matter in ulcers open to the air; but it al&s;o, as it becomes ab&s;orbed, &s;wells the lymphatic glands in its vicinity; as tho&s;e of the axilla, when the open cancer is on the brea&s;t. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 3.</P>
<P>Hence ex&s;ection before the cancer is open is generally a cure; but

after the matter has been expo&s;ed to the air, it is &s;eldom of &s;ervice; as the neighbouring lymphatic glands are already infected.

<P>Ero&s;ion with ar&s;enic, after the cancer is become an open ulcer, has generally no better effect than ex&s;ection, but has been &s;ucce&s;sful before ulceration. The be&s;t manner of u&s;ing ar&s;enic, is by mixing one grain with a dram of lapis calaminaris, and &s;trewing on the can|cer &s;ome of the powder every day, till the whole is de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Cancers on the face are &s;aid to ari&s;e from the perio&s;teum, and that unle&s;s this be de&s;troyed by the knife, or by cau&s;tics, the cancer cer|tainly recurs. After the cancer becomes an open ulcer of &s;ome extent, a purulent fever &s;upervenes, as from other open ulcers, and gradually de&s;troys the patient. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 6. 13.</P>
<P>Two very intere&s;ting ca&s;es have been lately publi&s;hed by Dr. Ew|art, of Bath, in which carbonic acid gas, or fixed air, was kept con|&s;tantly in contact with the open cancerous ulcers of the brea&s;t; which then healed like other common ulcers. This is rather to be a&s;cribed to the exclu&s;ion of oxygen, than to any &s;pecific virtue in the carbonic acid. As in common ulcers the matter does not induce hectic fever, till it has been expo&s;ed to the air, and then probably united with oxygen.</P>
<P>The manner of applying the fixed air, is by including the cancer in one half or hemi&s;phere of a large bladder; the edges are made to ad|here to the &s;kin by adhe&s;ive pla&s;ter, or perhaps a mixture of one part of honey with about twenty parts of carpenter's glue might better &s;uit &s;ome tender &s;kins. The bladder is then kept con&s;tantly filled with carbonic acid gas, by means of a pipe in the neck of it; and the matter let out at a &s;mall aperture beneath.</P>

The epiphy&s;es, or ends of the bones, being naturally of a loo&s;er texture, are mo&s;t liable to this di&s;ea&s;e, and perhaps the cartilages and cap&s;ular ligaments may al&s;o become inflamed and &s;welled along with the heads of the bones. This malady is liable to di&s;tort the fingers and knees, and is u&s;ually called gout or rheumati&s;m; the former of which is liable to di&s;able the fingers by chalk-&s;tones, and thence to have &s;omewhat a &s;imilar appearance. But the arthrocele, or &s;welling of the joints, affects people who have not been intemperate in the u&s;e of fermented or &s;pirituous liquors; or who have not previou&s;ly had a regular gout in their feet; and in both the&s;e circum&s;tances differs from the gout.

<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es even the matter formed beneath the &s;kin becomes in &s;ome degree contagious, at lea&s;t &s;o much &s;o as to produce fever of the hectic or malignant kind, as &s;oon as it has pierced through the &s;kin, and has thus gained acce&s;s to &s;ome kind of air; as the fre&s;h pu&s;s of a common ab&s;ce&s;s; or the putrid pus of an ab&s;ce&s;s, which has been long confined; or of cancerous ulcers.</P>
<P>From this analogy there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the matter of all contagious di&s;ea&s;es, whether with or without fever, is not infectious till it has acquired &s;omething from the air; which, by oxygenating the &s;ecreted matter, may probably produce a new acid.

acts on the &s;urface of the ulcer; as variolous matter affects the ino|culated part of the arm.

<P>In the itch there exi&s;ts not only great irritation in the production of the pu&s;tles, but great &s;en&s;ation is cau&s;ed by their acrimony afterwards; in&s;omuch that the pain of itching, without the interrupted &s;marting occa&s;ioned by &s;cratching, would be intolerable. This great excite|ment of the two &s;en&s;orial powers of irritation and &s;en&s;ation is &s;o great, when the pu&s;tles are diffu&s;ed over the whole &s;urface of the body, that a torpor &s;ucceeds the &s;udden cea&s;ing of it; which affects tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, which were mo&s;t catenated with the new motions of the

In three patients I have been induced to believe, that the eruption on the loins was a tran&s;lation of inflammation from the external membrane of the kidney to the &s;kin. They had, for a day or two before the appearance of the eruption, complained of a dull pain on the region of one kidney, but without vomiting; by which it was di&s;tingui&s;hed from nephritis interna, or gravel; and without pain down the out&s;ide of the thigh, by which it was di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;ciatica. In other &s;ituations the &s;hingles may &s;ympathize with other internal membranes, as in a ca&s;e publi&s;hed by Dr. Ru&s;&s;el (De Tabe Glandulari), where the retroce&s;&s;ion of the &s;hingles was &s;ucceed|ed by a &s;erious dy&s;pnaea.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Febris &s;en&s;itiva.</HI> Sen&s;itive fever, when unmixed with either ir|ritative or inirritative fever, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from either of them by the le&s;s comparative diminution of mu&s;cular &s;trength; or in other words, from its being attended with le&s;s diminution of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation. An example of unmixed &s;en&s;itive fever may ge|nerally be taken from the pulmonary con&s;umption; in this di&s;ea&s;e patients are &s;een to walk about with ea&s;e, and to do all the common offices of life for weeks, and even months, with a pul&s;e of 120 &s;trokes in a minute; while in other fevers, whether irritated or inirritated, with a pul&s;e of this frequency, the patient generally lies upon the bed, and exerts no mu&s;cular efforts without difficulty.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this curious phenomenon is thus to be under&s;tood; in the &s;en&s;itive fever a new &s;en&s;orial power, viz. that of &s;en&s;ation, is &s;uperadded to that of irritation; which in other fevers alone carries on the increa&s;ed circulation. Whence the power of irritation is not much more exhau&s;ted than in health; and tho&s;e mu&s;cular motions, which are produced in con&s;equence of it, as tho&s;e which are exerted in keeping the body upright in walking, riding, and in the per|formance of many cu&s;tomary actions, are little impaired.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Febris a pure clau&s;o.</HI> Fever from inclo&s;ed matter is generally of the irritated &s;en&s;itive kind, and continues for many weeks, and even months, after the ab&s;ce&s;s is formed; but is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the fever from aerated matter in open ulcers, becau&s;e there are &s;eldom any night-&s;weats, or colliquative diarrhoea in this, as in the latter. The pul&s;e is al&s;o harder, and requires occa&s;ional vene&s;ection, and ca|thartics, to abate the inflammatory fever; which is liable to increa&s;e again every three or four days, till at length, unle&s;s the matter has an exit, it de&s;troys the patient. In this fever the matter, not having been expo&s;ed to the air, has not acquired oxygenation; in which a new acid, or &s;ome other noxious property, is produced; which acts like contagion on the con&s;titution inducing fever-fits, called hectic fever, which terminate with &s;weats or diarrhoea; whereas the mat|ter in the clo&s;ed ab&s;ce&s;s is either not ab&s;orbed, or does not &s;o affect the circulation as to produce diurnal or hectic fever-fits; but the &s;timulus of the ab&s;ce&s;s excites &s;o much &s;en&s;ation as to induce perpe|tual pyrexia, or inflammatory fever, without &s;uch marked remi&s;&s;ions. Neverthele&s;s there &s;ometimes is no fever produced, when the matter is lodged in a part of little &s;en&s;ibility, as in the liver; yet a white pus|like &s;ediment in tho&s;e ca&s;es exi&s;ts I believe generally in the urine, with occa&s;ional wandering pains about the region of the liver or che&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Vomica.</HI> An ab&s;ce&s;s in the lungs is &s;ometimes produced after peripneumony, the cough and &s;hortne&s;s of breath continue in le&s;s degree, with difficulty in lying on the well &s;ide, and with &s;en&s;itive irritated fever, as explained in the preceding article.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ional increa&s;e of fever, with hard pul&s;e and &s;izy blood, in the&s;e patients, is probably owing to the inflammation of the walls of
<PB N="283" REF="2930">
the vomica; as it is attended with difficulty of breathing, and re|quires vene&s;ection. Mr. B&mdash;, a child about &s;even years old, lived about five weeks in this &s;ituation, with a pul&s;e from 150 to 170 in a minute, without &s;weats, or diarrhoea, or &s;ediment in his water, ex|cept mucus occa&s;ionally; and took &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment during the whole time. The blood taken was always covered with a &s;trong cupped &s;ize, and on his death three or four pints of matter were found in one &s;ide of the che&s;t; which had probably, but lately, been effu&s;ed from a vomica. This child was frequently induced to &s;wing, both in a reciprocating and in a rotatory &s;wing, without any apparent ab&s;orption of matter; in both the&s;e &s;wings he expre&s;&s;ed plea&s;ure, and did not appear to be vertiginous.</P>
<P>M. M. Repeated emetics. Digitalis? Per&s;everance in rotatory &s;winging. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 6. 7.</P>
<P>Mr. I. had laboured &s;ome months under a vomica after a peripneu|mony, he was at length taken with a catarrh, which was in &s;ome degree endemic in March 1795, which occa&s;ioned him to &s;neeze much, during which a copious haemorrhage from the lungs occurred, and he &s;pit up at the &s;ame time half a pint of very fetid matter, and recovered. Hence errhines may be occa&s;ionally u&s;ed with advantage.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Empyema.</HI> When the matter from an ab&s;ce&s;s in the lungs finds its way into the cavity of the che&s;t, it is called an empyema. A &s;ervant man, after a violent peripneumony, was &s;eized with &s;ymp|toms of empyema, and it was determined, after &s;ome time, to per|form the operation; this was explained to him, and the u&s;ual means were employed by his friends to encourage him, "by advi&s;ing him not to be afraid." By which good advice he conceived &s;o much fear, that he ran away early next morning, and returned in about a week quite well. Did the great fear promote the ab&s;orption of the matter, like the &s;ickne&s;s occa&s;ioned by digitalis? Fear renders the external &s;kin pale; by this continued decrea&s;e of the action of the ab&s;orbents

<P N="5">5. <HI>Febris Me&s;enterica.</HI> Fever from matter formed in the me&s;entery is probably more frequent than is &s;u&s;pected. It commences with pain in the bowels, with irritated &s;en&s;itive fever; and continues many weeks, and even months, requiring occa&s;ional vene&s;ection, and mild cathartics; till at length the continuance of the pyrexia, or inflam|matory fever, de&s;troys the patient. This is an affection of the lym|phatic glands, and properly belongs to &s;crophula; but as the mat|ter is not expo&s;ed to the air, no hectic fever, properly &s;o called, is induced.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Febris a pure aerato.</HI> Fever from aerated matter. A great col|lection of matter often continues a long time, and is &s;ometimes to|tally ab&s;orbed, even from venereal buboes, without producing any di&s;order in the arterial &s;y&s;tem. At length, if it becomes putrid by its delay, and one part of the matter thus becomes aerated by the air given out by the other part; or if the ulcer has been opened, &s;o that any part of it has been expo&s;ed to the air for but one day, a hectic fever is produced. Whence the utility ari&s;es of opening large ab&s;ce&s;&s;es by &s;etons, as in that ca&s;e little or no hectic fever is induced; becau&s;e the matter is &s;queezed out by the &s;ide of the &s;pongy threads of cotton, and little or no air is admitted; or by tapping the ab&s;ce&s;s with a trocar, as mentioned in i&s;chias, Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 18.</P>
<P>In this fever the pul&s;e is about 120 in a minute, and its acce&s;s is generally in an evening, and &s;ometimes about noon al&s;o, with &s;weats or purging towards morning, or urine with pus-like &s;ediment; and the patients bear this fever better than any other with &s;o quick a
<PB N="285" REF="2950">
pul&s;e; and la&s;tly, when all the matter from a concealed ulcer is ab|&s;orbed, or when an open ulcer is healed, the hectic fever cea&s;es. Here the ab&s;orbed matter is &s;uppo&s;ed to produce the fever, and the diarrhoea, &s;weats, or copious muddy urine, to be &s;imply the con&s;e|quence of increa&s;ed &s;ecretion, and not to con&s;i&s;t of the purulent mat|ter, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be ab&s;orbed from the ulcer. See Sudor calidus, Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 3.</P>
<P>The action of the air on ulcers, as we have already &s;hewn, in|crea&s;es the acrimony of the purulent matter, and even converts it into a weaker kind of contagious matter; that is, to a material in|ducing fever. This was a&s;cribed to the union of the azotic part of the atmo&s;phere with the effu&s;ed pus in Sect. XXVIII. 2. but by con|templating more numerous facts and analogies, I am now induced to believe, that it is by the union of oxygen with it; fir&s;t, becau&s;e oxy|gen &s;o greedily unites with other animal &s;ub&s;tances, as the blood, that it will pa&s;s through a moi&s;t bladder to combine with it, accord|ing to the experiment of Dr. Prie&s;tley. Secondly, becau&s;e the poi|&s;ons of venomous creatures are &s;uppo&s;ed to be acids of different kinds, and are probably formed by the contact of air after their &s;ecretion. And la&s;tly, becau&s;e the contagious matter from other ulcers, as in itch, or &s;mall-pox, are formed on external membranes, and are pro|bably combinations of animal matter and oxygen, producing other new acids; but further experiments mu&s;t determine this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It was thought a &s;ubject of con&s;equence by the Ae&s;culapian Society at Edinburgh, to find a criterion which &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h pus from mucus, for the purpo&s;e of more certainly di&s;covering the pre&s;ence of ulcers in pulmonary di&s;ea&s;es, or in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages. For this purpo&s;e that &s;ociety offered their fir&s;t gold medal, which was con|ferred on the late Mr. Charles Darwin, in the year 1778, for his ex|periments on this &s;ubject. From which he deduces the following conclu&s;ions:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="286" REF="2960">
"1. Pus and mucus are both &s;oluble in the vitriolic acid, though in very different proportions, pus being much the le&s;s &s;oluble.</P>
<P N="2">2. The addition of water to either of the&s;e compounds decom|po&s;es it; the mucus thus &s;eparated, either &s;wims on the mixture, or forms large flocci in it; whereas the pus falls to the bottom, and forms on agitation a uniform turbid mixture.</P>
<P N="3">3. Pus is diffu&s;ible through a diluted vitriolic acid, though mucus is not; the &s;ame occurs with water, or a &s;olution of &s;ea &s;alt.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nitrous acid di&s;&s;olves both pus and mucus; water added to the &s;olution of pus produces a precipitate; and the fluid above becomes clear and green; while water and the &s;olution of mucus form a dirty coloured fluid.</P>
<P N="5">5. Alkaline lixivium di&s;&s;olves (though &s;ometimes with difficulty) mucus, and generally pus.</P>
<P N="6">6. Water precipitates pus from &s;uch a &s;olution, but does not mucus.</P>
<P N="7">7. Where alkaline lixivium does not di&s;&s;olve pus, it &s;till di&s;|tingui&s;hes it from mucus; as it then prevents its diffu&s;ion through water.</P>
<P N="8">8. Coagulable lymph is neither &s;oluble in diluted nor concentrated vitriolic acid.</P>
<P N="9">9. Water produces no change on a &s;olution of &s;erum in alkaline lixivium, until after long &s;tanding, and then only a very &s;light &s;edi|ment appears.</P>
<P N="10">10. Corro&s;ive &s;ublimate coagulates mucus, but does not pus.</P>
<P>From the above experiments it appears, that &s;trong vitriolic acid and water, diluted vitriolic acid, and cau&s;tic alkaline lixivium and water will &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h pus from mucus; that the vitriolic acid can &s;eparate it from coagulable lymph, and alkaline lixivium from &s;erum.</P>

If in neither a precipitation oc|curs, it is a certain te&s;t, that the material is entirely mucus.

The ulcers are probably &s;ome|times occa&s;ioned by the putrid acrimony of effu&s;ed blood remaining in the air-cells of the lungs after an haemoptoe. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 9. The remote cau&s;e of con&s;umption is ingeniou&s;ly a&s;cribed by Dr. Bed|does to the hyper oxygenation of the blood, as mentioned Section XXVIII. 2.</P>
<P>As the patients liable to con&s;umption are of the inirritable tempera|ment, as appears by the large pupils of their eyes; there is rea&s;on to believe, that the haemoptoe is immediately occa&s;ioned by the deficient ab&s;orption of the blood at the extremities of the bronchial vein; and that one difficulty of healing the ulcers is occa&s;ioned by the deficient ab&s;orption of the fluids effu&s;ed into them. See Sect. XXX. 1. and 2.</P>
<P>The difficulty of healing pulmonary ulcers may be owing, as its remote cau&s;e, to the ince&s;&s;ant motion of all the parts of the lungs; whence no &s;cab, or indurated mucus, can be formed &s;o as to adhere on them. Whence the&s;e naked ulcers are perpetually expo&s;ed to the action of the air on their &s;urfaces, converting their mild purulent matter into a contagious ichor; which not only prevents them from
<PB N="288" REF="2980">
healing, but by its action on their circumferences, like the matter of itch or tinea, contributes to &s;pread them wider. See the preceding article, and Sect. XXXIII. 2. 7. where the pulmonary phthi&s;is is &s;uppo&s;ed to be infectious.</P>
<P>This acidifying principle is found in all the metallic calces, as in lapis calaminaris, which is a calciform ore of zinc; and in ceru&s;&s;a, which is a calx of lead; two materials which are powerful in healing excoriations, and ulcers, in a &s;hort time by their external application. How then does it happen, that the oxygen in the atmo&s;phere &s;hould prevent pulmonary ulcers from healing, and even induce them to &s;pread wider; and yet in its combination with metals, it &s;hould faci|litate their healing? The healing of ulcers con&s;i&s;ts in promoting the ab&s;orption of the fluids effu&s;ed into them, as treated of in Section XXXIII. 3. 2. Oxygen in combination with metals, when applied in certain quantity, produces this effect by its &s;timulus; and the me|tallic oxydes not being decompo&s;ed by their contact with animal matter, no new acid, or contagious material, is produced. So that the combined oxygen, when applied to an ulcer, &s;imply I &s;uppo&s;e promotes ab&s;orption in it, like the application of other materials of the articles &s;orbentia or incitantia, if applied externally; as opium, bark, alum. But in the pulmonary ulcers, which cannot protect them&s;elves from the air by forming a &s;cab, the uncombined oxygen of the atmo&s;phere unites with the purulent matter, converting it into a contagious ichor; which by infection, not by ero&s;ion, enlarges the ulcers, as in the itch or tinea; which might hence, according to Dr. Beddoes's ingenious theory of con&s;umption, be induced to heal, if ex|po&s;ed to an atmo&s;phere deprived of a part of its oxygen. This I hope future experiments will confirm, and that the pneumatic medicine will alleviate the evils of mankind in many other, as well as in this mo&s;t fatal malady.</P>
<P>M. M. Fir&s;t, the re&s;piration of air lowered by an additional quan|tity of azote, or mixed with &s;ome proportion of hydrogen, or of carbonic
<PB N="289" REF="2990">
acid air, may be tried; as de&s;cribed in a late publication of Dr. Beddoes on the medicinal u&s;e of factitious airs. John&s;on, London. Or la&s;tly, by breathing a mixture of one tenth part of hydro-carbo|nate mixed with common air, according to the di&s;covery of Mr. Watt, which has a double advantage in the&s;e ca&s;es, of diluting the oxygen of the atmo&s;pheric air, and inducing &s;ickne&s;s, which increa&s;es pul|monary ab&s;orption, as mentioned below. An atmo&s;phere diluted with fixed air (carbonic acid) might be readily procured by &s;etting tubs of new wort, or fermenting beer, in the parlour and lodging|room of the patient. For it is not acids floating in the air, but the oxygen or acidifying principle, which injures or enlarges pulmonary ulcers by combining with the purulent matter.</P>
<P>Another ea&s;y method of adding carbonic acid gas to the air of a room, would be by means of an apparatus invented by Mr. Watt, and &s;old by Bolton and Watt at Birmingham, as de&s;cribed in Dr. Beddoes' Treati&s;e on Pneumatic Medicine. John&s;on, London. It con&s;i&s;ts of an iron pot, with an arm projecting, and a method of let|ting water drop by &s;low degrees on chalk, which is to be put into the iron pot, and expo&s;ed to a moderate degree of heat over a common fire. By occa&s;ionally adding more and more chalk, carbonic acid gas might be carried through a tin pipe from the arm of the iron pot to any part of the room near the patient, or from an adjoining room. In the &s;ame manner a diffu&s;ion of &s;olution of flowers of zinc might be produced and breathed by the patient, and would be likely much to contribute to the healing of pulmonary ulcers; as ob&s;erved by Mr. Watt. See the treati&s;e above mentioned.</P>
<P>Breathing over the vapour of cau&s;tic volatile alkali might ea&s;ily be managed for many hours in a day; which might neutralize the acid poi&s;on formed on pulmonary ulcers by the contact of oxygen, and thus prevent its deleterious quality, as other acids become le&s;s cau&s;|tic, when they are formed into neutral &s;alts with alkalis. The volatile
<PB N="290" REF="3000">
&s;alt &s;hould be put into a tin cani&s;ter, with two pipes like horns from the top of it, one to &s;uck the air from, and the other to admit it.</P>
<P>Secondly, the external ulcers in &s;crophulous habits are pale and flabby, and naturally di&s;inclined to heal, the depo&s;ition of fluids in them being greater than the ab&s;orption; the&s;e ulcers have their ap|pearance immediately changed by the external application of metallic calxes, and the medicines of the article Sorbentia, &s;uch as ceru&s;&s;a and the bark in fine powder, &s;ee Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 21. and are generally healed in a &s;hort time by the&s;e means. Induced by the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I wi&s;hed to try the external application of &s;uch powders to ulcers in the lungs, and con&s;tructed a box with a circulating bru&s;h in it, as de&s;cribed in the annexed plate; into this box two ounces of fine powder of Peru|vian bark were put, and two drams of ceru&s;&s;a in fine powder; on whirling the central bru&s;h, part of this was rai&s;ed into a cloud of powder, and the patient, applying his mouth to one of the tin pipes ri&s;ing out of the box, inhaled this powder twice a day into his lungs. I ob&s;erved it did not produce any cough or unea&s;ine&s;s. This patient was in the la&s;t &s;tage of con&s;umption, and was &s;oon tired of the expe|riment, nor have I had &s;uch patients as I wi&s;hed for the repetition of it. Perhaps a fine powder of mangane&s;e, or of the flowers of zinc, or of lapis calaminaris, might be thus applied to ulcers of the lungs with greater advantage? Perhaps air impregnated with flowers of zinc in their mo&s;t comminuted &s;tate, might be a better way of apply|ing this powder to the lungs, as di&s;covered by Mr. Watt. See Dr. Beddoes on Pneumatic Medicine. John&s;on.</P>
<P>Thirdly, as the healing of an ulcer con&s;i&s;ts in producing a tendency to ab&s;orption on its &s;urface greater than the depo&s;ition on it; &s;ee Sect. XXXIII. 3. 2. other modes of increa&s;ing pulmonary ab&s;orption, which are perhaps more manageable than the preceding ones, may be had recour&s;e to; &s;uch as by producing frequent nau&s;ea or &s;ickne&s;s. See Sect. XXIX. 5. 1. and Art. IV. 2. The great and &s;udden ab&s;orption

of fluid from the lungs in the ana&s;arca pulmonum by the &s;ickne&s;s induced by the exhibition of digitalis, a&s;toni&s;hes tho&s;e who have not before attended to it, by emptying the &s;welled limbs, and removing the difficulty of breathing in a few hours.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t manageable method of u&s;ing digitalis is by making a &s;a|turated tincture of it, by infu&s;ing two ounces of the powder of the leaves in a mixture of four ounces of rectified &s;pirit of wine, and four ounces of water. Of this from 30 to 60 drops, or upwards, from a two-ounce phial, are to be taken twice in the morning part of the day, and to be &s;o managed as not to induce violent &s;ickne&s;s. If &s;ick|ne&s;s neverthele&s;s comes on, the patient mu&s;t for a day or two omit the medicine; and then begin it again in reduced do&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr.&mdash;, a young man about twenty, with dark eyes, and large pupils, who had every &s;ymptom of pulmonary ulcers, I believed to have been cured by digitalis, and publi&s;hed the ca&s;e in the Tran&s;ac|tions of the College, Vol. III. But about two years afterwards I heard that he relap&s;ed and died. Mr. L&mdash;, a corpulent man, who had for &s;ome weeks laboured under a cough with great expectoration, with quick pul&s;e, and difficulty of breathing, &s;oon recovered by the u&s;e of digitalis taken twice a day; and though this ca&s;e might probably be a peripneumonia notha, or catarrh, it is here related as &s;hewing the power of pulmonary ab&s;orption excited by the u&s;e of this drug.</P>
<P>Another method of inducing &s;ickne&s;s, and pulmonary ab&s;orption in con&s;equence, is by &s;ailing on the &s;ea; by which many con&s;ump|tive patients have been &s;aid to have received their cure; which has been erroneou&s;ly a&s;cribed to &s;ea-air, in&s;tead of &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s; whence many have been &s;ent to breathe the &s;ea-air on the coa&s;ts, who might have done better in higher &s;ituations, where the air probably contains le&s;s oxygen gas, which is the heavie&s;t part of it. See a Letter from Dr. T. C. below.</P>
<P>A third method of inducing &s;ickne&s;s, and con&s;equent pulmonary
<PB N="292" REF="3030">
ab&s;orption, is by the vertigo occa&s;ioned by &s;winging; which has lately been introduced into practice by Dr. Smith, (E&s;&s;ay on Pulmo|nary Con&s;umption), who ob&s;erved that by &s;winging the hectic pul&s;e became &s;lower, which is explained in Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 10. The u&s;ual way of reciprocating &s;winging, like the o&s;cillations of a pendulum, produces a degree of vertigo in tho&s;e, who are unu&s;ed to it; but to give it greater effect, the patient &s;hould be placed in a chair &s;u&s;pended from the ceiling by two parallel cords in contact with each other, the chair &s;hould then be forcibly revolved 20 or 40 times one way, and &s;uffered to return &s;pontaneou&s;ly; which induces a degree of &s;ickne&s;s in mo&s;t adult people, and is well worthy an exact and pertinacious trial, for an hour or two, three or four times a day for a month.</P>
<P>The common means of promoting ab&s;orption in ulcers, and of thickening the matter in con&s;equence, by taking the bark and opium internally, or by metallic &s;alts, as of mercury, &s;teel, zinc, and cop|per, in &s;mall quantities, have been repeatedly u&s;ed in pulmonary con&s;umption; and may have relieved &s;ome of the &s;ymptoms. As mercury cures venereal ulcers, and as pulmonary ulcers re&s;emble them in their not having a di&s;po&s;ition to heal, and in their tendency to enlarge them&s;elves, there were hopes, from analogy, that it might have &s;ucceeded. Would a &s;olution of gold in aqua regia be worth trying? When vinegar is applied to the lips, it renders them in&s;tan$|ly pale, by promoting the venous ab&s;orption; if the whole &s;kin was moi&s;tened with warmi&s;h vinegar, would this promote venous ab&s;orp|tion in the lungs by their &s;ympathy with the &s;kin? The very ab&s;te|mious diet on milk and vegetables alone is frequently injurious. Fle&s;h-meat once a day, with &s;mall wine and water, or &s;mall beer, is preferable. Half a grain of opium twice a day, or a grain, I believe to be of great u&s;e at the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, as appears from the &s;ub&s;equent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s&mdash;, a delicate young lady, of a con&s;umptive family, when &s;he was about eighteen, had frequent cough, with quick pul&s;e, a

pain of her &s;ide, and the general appearances of a beginning con&s;ump|tion. She took about five drops of laudanum twice a day in a &s;aline draught, which was increa&s;ed gradually to ten. In a few weeks &s;he recovered, was afterwards married, bore three or four children, and then became con&s;umptive and died.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e of hereditary con&s;umption is related by a phy|&s;ician of great ability and very exten&s;ive practice; and, as it is his own ca&s;e, abounds with much nice ob&s;ervation and u&s;eful knowledge; and, as it has been attended with a favourable event, may give con|&s;olation to many, who are in a &s;imilar &s;ituation; and &s;hews that Sydenham's recommendation of riding as a cure for con&s;umption is not &s;o totally ineffectual, as is now commonly believed.</P>
<P>"J. C. aged 27, with black hair, and a ruddy complexion, was &s;ubject to cough from the age of puberty, and occa&s;ionally to &s;pitting of blood. His maternal grandfather died of con&s;umption under thirty years of age, and his mother fell a victim to this di&s;ea&s;e, with which &s;he had long been threatened, in her 43d year, and immediately after &s;he cea&s;ed to have children. In the &s;evere winter of 1783-4, he was much afflicted with cough; and being expo&s;ed to inten&s;e cold, in the month of February he was &s;eized with peripneumony. The di&s;ea&s;e was violent and dangerous, and after repeated bleedings as well as bli&s;terings, which he &s;upported with difficulty, in about &s;ix weeks he was able to leave his bed. At this time the cough was &s;evere, and the expectoration difficult. A fixed pain remained on the left &s;ide, where an i&s;&s;ue was in&s;erted; regular hectic came on every day about an hour after noon, and every night heat and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s took place, &s;ucceeded towards morning by general per&s;piration.</P>
<P>The patient, having formerly been &s;ubject to ague, was &s;truck with the re&s;emblance of the febrile paroxy&s;m, with what he had ex|perienced under that di&s;ea&s;e, and was willing to flatter him&s;elf it might be of the &s;ame nature. He therefore took bark in the interval of fever, but with an increa&s;e of his cough, and this requiring vene&s;ection,
<PB N="294" REF="3050">
the blood was found highly inflammatory. The va&s;t quan|tity of blood which he had lo&s;t from time to time, produced a di&s;po|&s;ition to fainting, when he re&s;umed the upright po&s;ture, and he was therefore obliged to remain almo&s;t con&s;tantly in a recumbent po&s;ition. Attempting to ride out in a carriage, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that he could &s;it upright for a con&s;iderable time, while in motion, without inconvenience, though, on &s;topping the carriage, the di&s;po&s;ition to fainting returned.</P>
<P>At this time, having prolonged his ride beyond the u&s;ual length, he one day got into an uneven road at the u&s;ual period of the recur|rence of the hectic paroxy&s;ms, and that day he mi&s;&s;ed it altogether. This circum&s;tance led him to ride out daily in a carriage at the time the febrile acce&s;&s;ion might be expected, and &s;ometimes by this means it was prevented, &s;ometimes deferred, and almo&s;t always mitigated.</P>
<P>This experience determined him to undertake a journey of &s;ome length, and Bri&s;tol being, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, recommended, he &s;et out on the 19th of April, and arrived there on the 2d of May. During the greater part of this journey (of 175 miles) his cough was &s;evere, and being obliged to be bled three different times on the road, he was no longer able to &s;it upright, but at very &s;hort intervals, and was obliged to lie at length in the diagonal of a coach. The hectic paroxy&s;ms were not interrupted during the journey, but they were irregular and indi&s;tinct, and the &s;alutary effects of exerci&s;e, or rather of ge&s;tation, were impre&s;&s;ed on the patient's mind.</P>
<P>At Bri&s;tol he &s;tayed a month, but reaped no benefit. The weather was dry and the roads du&s;ty; the water in&s;ipid and inert. He at|tempted to ride on hor&s;eback on the downs, but was not able to bear the fatigue for a di&s;tance of more than a hundred yards. The nece&s;|&s;ity of frequent bleedings kept down his &s;trength, and his hectic pa|roxy&s;ms continued, though le&s;s &s;evere. At this time, &s;u&s;pecting that his cough was irritated by the we&s;t-winds bearing the vapour
<PB N="295" REF="3060">
from the &s;ea, he re&s;olved to try the effects of an inland &s;ituation, and &s;et off for Matlock in Derby&s;hire.</P>
<P>During the journey he did not find the improvement he expected, but the nightly per&s;pirations began to dimini&s;h; and the extraordinary fatigue he experienced proceeded evidently from his travelling in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, where he could not indulge in a recumbent po&s;ition. The weather at Bri&s;tol had been hot, and the earth arid and du&s;ty. At Matlock, during the month of June 1784, there was almo&s;t a perpetual drizzle, the &s;oil was wet, and the air moi&s;t and cold. Here, however, the patient's cough began to abate, and at intervals he found an opportunity of riding more or le&s;s on hor&s;eback. From two or three hundred yards at a time, he got to ride a mile without &s;topping; and at length he was able to &s;it on hor&s;eback during a ride from Ma&s;on's Bath to the village of Matlock along the Derwent, and round on the oppo&s;ite banks, by the works of Mr. Arkwright, back to the hou&s;e whence he &s;tarted, a di&s;tance of five miles. On di&s;|mounting, however, he was &s;eized with diliquium, and &s;oon after the &s;trength he had recovered was lo&s;t by an attack of the haemorrhoids of the mo&s;t painful kind, and requiring much lo&s;s of blood from the parts affected.</P>
<P>On reflection, it appeared that the only benefit received by the pa|tient was during motion, and continued motion could better be ob|tained in the cour&s;e of a journey than during his re&s;idence at any par|ticular place. This, and other circum&s;tances of a private but painful nature, determined him to &s;et out from Matlock on a journey to Scot|land. The weather was now much improved, and during the jour|ney he recruited his &s;trength. Though as yet he could not &s;it up|right at re&s;t for half an hour together without a di&s;po&s;ition to giddi|ne&s;s, dimne&s;s of &s;ight, and deliquium, he was able to &s;it upright under the motion of a po&s;t-chai&s;e during a journey of from 40 to 70 miles daily, and his appetite began to improve. Still his cough continued,
<PB N="296" REF="3070">
and his hectic flu&s;hings, though the chills were much abated and very irregular.</P>
<P>The &s;alutary effects of motion being now more &s;triking than ever, he purcha&s;ed a hor&s;e admirably adapted to a valetudinarian in Dum|fries&s;hire, and being now able to &s;it on hor&s;eback for an hour to|gether, he rode out &s;everal times a day. He fixed his re&s;idence for a few weeks at Moffat, a village at the foot of the mountains whence the Tweed, the Clyde, and the Annan, de&s;cend in different direc|tions; a &s;ituation inland, dry, and healthy, and elevated about three hundred feet above the &s;urface of the &s;ea. Here his &s;trength reco|vered daily, and he began to eat animal food, which for &s;everal months before he had not ta&s;ted. Per&s;evering in exerci&s;e on hor&s;e|back, he gradually increa&s;ed the length of his rides, according to his &s;trength, from four to twenty miles a day; and returning on hor&s;e|back to Lanca&s;hire by the lakes of Cumberland, he arrived at Liver|pool on the fir&s;t of September, having rode the la&s;t day of his journey forty miles.</P>
<P>The two inferences of mo&s;t importance to be drawn from this nar|rative, are, fir&s;t, the extraordinary benefit derived from ge&s;tation in a carriage, and &s;till more the mixture of ge&s;tation and exerci&s;e on hor&s;eback, in arre&s;ting or mitigating the hectic paroxy&s;m; and &s;e|condly, that in the florid con&s;umption, as Dr. Beddoes terms it, an elevated and inland air is in certain circum&s;tances peculiarly &s;alutary; while an atmo&s;phere loaded with the &s;pray of the &s;ea is irritating and noxious. The benefit derived in this ca&s;e from exerci&s;e on hor&s;e|back, may lead us to doubt whether Sydenham's prai&s;e of this re|medy be as much exaggerated as it has of late been &s;uppo&s;ed. Since the publication of Dr. C. Smyth on the effects of &s;winging in lower|ing the pul&s;e in the hectic paroxy&s;m, the &s;ubject of this narrative has repeated his experiments in a great variety of ca&s;es, and has con|firmed them. He has al&s;o repeatedly &s;een the hectic paroxy&s;m prevented,
<PB N="297" REF="3080">
or cut &s;hort, by external ablution of the naked body with tepid water.</P>
<P>So much was his power of dige&s;tion impaired or vitiated by the immen&s;e evacuations, and the long continued debility he underwent, that after the cough was removed, and indeed for &s;everal years after the period mentioned, he never could eat animal food without heat and flu&s;hing, with frequent pul&s;e and extreme drow&s;ine&s;s. If this drow&s;ine&s;s was encouraged, the fever ran high, and he awoke from di&s;turbed &s;leep, wearied and depre&s;&s;ed. If it was re&s;olutely re&s;i&s;ted by gentle exerci&s;e, it went off in about an hour, as well as the in|crea&s;ed frequency of the pul&s;e. This agitation was however &s;uch as to incapacitate him during the afternoon for &s;tudy of any kind. The &s;ame effects did not follow a meal of milk and vegetables, but under this diet his &s;trength did not recruit; whereas after the u&s;e of animal food it recovered rapidly, notwith&s;tanding the inconvenience already mentioned. For this inconvenience he at la&s;t found a remedy in the u&s;e of coffee immediately after dinner, recommended to him by his friend Dr. Percival. At fir&s;t this remedy operated like a charm, but by frequent u&s;e, and indeed by abu&s;e, it no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its origi|nal efficacy.</P>
<P>Dr. Falconer, in his Di&s;&s;ertation on the Influence of the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections of the Mind on Health and Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;uppo&s;es that the cheerfulne&s;s which attends hectic fever, the ever-&s;pringing hope, which brightens the gloom of the con&s;umptive patient, increa&s;es the di&s;ea&s;ed actions, and ha&s;tens his doom. And hence he is led to en|quire, whether the influence of fear might not be &s;ub&s;tituted in &s;uch ca&s;es to that of hope with advantage to the patient? This que&s;tion I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to an&s;wer, but it leads me to &s;ay &s;omething of the &s;tate of the mind in the ca&s;e ju&s;t related.</P>
<P>The patient, being a phy&s;ician, was not ignorant of his danger, which &s;ome melancholy circum&s;tances &s;erved to impre&s;s on his mind. It has already been mentioned, that his mother and grandfather died
<PB N="298" REF="3090">
of this di&s;ea&s;e. It may be added, that in the year preceding that on which he him&s;elf was attacked, a &s;i&s;ter of his was carried off by con|&s;umption in her 17th year; that in the &s;ame winter in which he fell ill, two other &s;i&s;ters were &s;eized with the &s;ame fatal di&s;order, to which one of them fell a victim during his re&s;idence at Bri&s;tol, and that the hope of bidding a la&s;t adieu to the other was the immediate cau&s;e of his journey to Scotland, a hope which, alas! was indulged in vain. The day on which he reached the end of his journey, her remains were committed to the du&s;t! It may be conjectured from the&s;e circum&s;tances, that whatever benefit may be derived from the apprehen&s;ion of death, mu&s;t in this ca&s;e have been obtained. The expectation of this i&s;&s;ue was indeed for &s;ome time &s;o fixed that it cea&s;ed to produce much agitation; in conformity to that general law of our nature, by which almo&s;t all men &s;ubmit with compo&s;ure to a fate that is fore&s;een, and that appears inevitable. As however the progre&s;s of di&s;ea&s;e and debility &s;eemed to be arre&s;ted, the hope and the love of life revived, and produced, from time to time, the ob&s;erva|tions and the exertions already mentioned.</P>

The&s;e parts are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been injured by the exer|tions accompanying labour; and as matter in this vi&s;cus may have been produced without much pain, this di&s;ea&s;e is not attended with arterial &s;trength and hard full pul&s;e like the inflammation of the ute|rus; and as the fever is of the inirritative or typhus kind, there is rea&s;on to believe, that the previous exhau&s;tion of the patient during labour may contribute to its production; as well as the ab&s;orption of a material not purulent but putrid; which is formed by the delay of extrava&s;ated or dead matter produced by the brui&s;es of the omentum, or other vi&s;cera, in the efforts of parturition, rather than by purulent matter, the con&s;equence of &s;uppuration. The pul&s;e is generally about 120 when in bed and in the morning; and is increa&s;ed to 134, or more, when the patient &s;its up, or in the evening paroxy&s;m. The pul&s;e of all very weak patients increa&s;es in frequency when they &s;it up; becau&s;e the expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve an erect po&s;ture deducts &s;o much from their general &s;trength; and hence the pul&s;e becomes weaker, and in con&s;equence quicker.

In this fever time mu&s;t be allowed for the ab&s;orption of the matter. Very large and repeated quantities of the bark, by preventing &s;uffici|ent food from being taken, as bread, and wine, and water, I have thought has much injured the patient; for the bark is not here given as in intermittent fevers to prevent the paroxy&s;m, but &s;imply to &s;trengthen the patient by increa&s;ing the power of dige&s;tion. About two ounces of decoction of bark, with four drops of laudanum, and a dram of &s;weet &s;pirit of vitriol, once in &s;ix hours, and a gla&s;s of wine between tho&s;e times, with panada, or other food, I have thought of mo&s;t advantage, with a &s;mall bli&s;ter occa&s;ionally.</P>

The ideas in delirium con&s;i&s;t of tho&s;e excited by the &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure or pain, which precedes them, and the trains of other ideas a&s;&s;ociated with the&s;e, and not of tho&s;e excited by external irritations or by voluntary exertion. Hence the patients do not know the room which they inhabit, or the peo|ple who &s;urround them; nor have they any voluntary exertion, where the delirium is complete; &s;o that their efforts in walking about a room or ri&s;ing from their bed are un&s;teady, and produced by their catena|tions with the immediate affections of plea&s;ure or pain. See Section XXXIII. 1. 4.</P>
<P>By the above circum&s;tances it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from madne&s;s, in which the patients well know the per&s;ons of their acquaintance, and the place where they are; and perform all the voluntary actions with &s;teadine&s;s and determination. See Sect. XXXIV. 2. 2.</P>
<P>Delirium is &s;ometimes le&s;s complete, and then a new face and louder voice &s;timulate the patient to attend to them for a few moments; and then they relap&s;e again into perfect delirium. At other times a deli|rium affects but one &s;en&s;e, and the per&s;on thinks he &s;ees things which do not exi&s;t; and is at the &s;ame time &s;en&s;ible to the que&s;tions which are a&s;ked him, and to the ta&s;te of the food which is offered to him.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="3150">
This partial delirium is termed an hallucination of the di&s;ordered organ; and may probably ari&s;e from the origin of one nerve of &s;en&s;e being more liable to inflammation than the others; that is, an exube|rance of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation may affect it; which is there|fore thrown into action by &s;lighter &s;en&s;itive catenations, without being obedient to external &s;timulus, or to the power of volition.</P>
<P>The perpetual flow of ideas in delirium is owing to the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tance, as of tho&s;e in our dreams; namely, to the defect or pa|raly&s;is of the voluntary power; as in hemiplagia, when one &s;ide of the body is paralytic, and thus expends le&s;s of the &s;en&s;orial power, the limbs on the other &s;ide are in con&s;tant motion from the exube|rance of it. Whence le&s;s &s;en&s;orial power is exhau&s;ted in delirium, than at other times, as well as in &s;leep; and hence in fevers with great debility, it is perhaps, as well as the &s;tupor, rather a favourable circum&s;tance; and when removed by numerous bli&s;ters, the death of the patient often follows the recovery of his under&s;tanding. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 5. 6. and I. 2. 5. 10.</P>
<P>Delirium in di&s;ea&s;es from inirritability is &s;ometimes preceded by a propen&s;ity to &s;urpri&s;e. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 5. 12.</P>

<P>I have &s;een other ca&s;es of what may be termed anorexia epi|leptica, in which a total lo&s;s of appetite, and of the power of dige&s;tion, &s;uddenly occurred along with epileptic fits. Mi&s;s B. a girl about eighteen, apparently very healthy, and rather plump, was &s;eized with fits, which were at fir&s;t called hy&s;terical; they occurred at the end of men&s;truation, and returned very frequently with total lo&s;s of appetite. She was relieved by vene&s;ection, bli&s;ters, and opi|ates; her &s;trength dimini&s;hed, and after &s;ome returns of the fits, &s;he took to her bed, and has &s;urvived 15 or 20 years; &s;he has in general eaten half a potato a day, and &s;eldom &s;peaks, but retains her &s;en&s;es, and had many years occa&s;ional returns of convul&s;ion.

<P>WE now &s;tep forward to con&s;ider the di&s;ea&s;es of volition, that &s;u|perior faculty of the &s;en&s;orium, which gives us the power of rea&s;on, and by its facility of action di&s;tingui&s;hes mankind from brute animals; which has effected all that is great in the world, and &s;uperimpo&s;ed the works of art on the &s;ituations of nature.</P>
<P>Pain is introduced into the &s;y&s;tem either by exce&s;s or defect of the action of the part. (Sect. IV. 5.) Both which circum&s;tances &s;eem to originate from the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the affected organ. Thus when the &s;kin is expo&s;ed to great cold, the activity of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els is dimini&s;hed, and in con&s;equence an accumula|tion of &s;en&s;orial power obtains in them, becau&s;e they are u&s;ually ex|cited into ince&s;&s;ant motion by the &s;timulus of heat, as explained in Sect. XII. 5. 2. Contrarywi&s;e, when the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin are ex|po&s;ed to great heat, an exce&s;s of &s;en&s;orial power is al&s;o produced in them, which is derived thither by the increa&s;e of &s;timulus above what is natural.</P>
<P>This accounts for the relief which is received in all kinds of pain by any violent exertions of our mu&s;cles or organs of &s;en&s;e; which may
<PB N="322" REF="3320">
thus be in part a&s;cribed to the exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power by &s;uch exertions. But this relief is in many ca&s;es &s;o in&s;tantaneous, that it &s;eems neverthele&s;s probable, that it is al&s;o in part owing to the dif|ferent manner of progre&s;&s;ion of the two &s;en&s;orial powers of &s;en&s;ation and volition; one of them commencing at &s;ome extremity of the &s;en|&s;orium, and being propagated towards the central parts of it; and the other commencing in the central parts of the &s;en&s;orium, and being propagated towards the extremities of it; as mentioned in Sect. XI. 2. 1.</P>
<P>The&s;e violent voluntary exertions of our mu&s;eles or ideas to relieve the &s;en&s;ation of pain con&s;titute convul&s;ions and madne&s;s; and are di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the mu&s;cular actions owing to increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ation, as in &s;neezing, or coughing, or parturition, or ejectio &s;eminis, becau&s;e they do not contribute to di&s;lodge the cau&s;e, but only to prevent the &s;en&s;ation of it. In two ca&s;es of parturition, both of young women with their fir&s;t child, I have &s;een general convul&s;ions occur from ex|ce&s;s of voluntary exertion, as above de&s;cribed, in&s;tead of the actions of particular mu&s;cles, which ought to have been excited by &s;en&s;ation for the exclu&s;ion of the fetus. They both became in&s;en&s;ible, and died after &s;ome hours; from one of them the fetus was extracted in vain. I have heard al&s;o of general convul&s;ions being excited in&s;tead of the actions of the mu&s;culi acceleratores in the ejectio &s;eminis, which terminated fatally. See Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. 7.</P>
<P>The&s;e violent exertions are mo&s;t frequently excited in con&s;equence of tho&s;e pains, which originate from defect of the action of the part. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. and 2. The pains from exce&s;s and defect of the action of the part are di&s;tingui&s;hable from each other by the former being attended with increa&s;e of heat in the pained part, or of the whole body; while the latter not only exi&s;t without increa&s;e of heat in the pained part, but are generally attended with coldne&s;s of the ex|tremities of the body.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the&s;e violent actions of our mu&s;cular or &s;en&s;ual &s;ibres
<PB N="323" REF="3330">
for the purpo&s;e of relieving pain cea&s;e to be exerted, the pain recurs; whence the reciprocal contraction and relaxation of the mu&s;cles in con|vul&s;ion, and the intervals of madne&s;s. Otherwi&s;e the&s;e violent ex|ertions continue, till &s;o great a part of the &s;en&s;orial power is exhau&s;t|ed, that no more of it is excitable by the faculty of volition; and a temporary apoplexy &s;ucceeds, with &s;noring as in profound &s;leep; which &s;o generally terminates epileptic fits.</P>
<P>When the&s;e voluntary exertions become &s;o connected with certain di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations, or with irritations, that the effort of the will cannot re&s;train them, they can no longer in common language be termed voluntary; but neverthele&s;s belong to this cla&s;s, as they are produced by exce&s;s of volition, and may &s;till not improperly be called depraved voluntary actions. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. where many motions in common language termed involuntary are &s;hewn to de|pend on exce&s;s of volition.</P>
<P>When the&s;e exertions from exce&s;s of volition, which in common language are termed involuntary motions, either of mind or body, are perpetually exerted in weak con&s;titutions, the pul&s;e becomes quick; which is occa&s;ioned by the too great expenditure of the &s;en&s;orial power in the&s;e uncea&s;ing modes of activity. In the &s;ame manner as in very weak people in fevers, the pul&s;e &s;ometimes increa&s;es in fre|quency to 140 &s;trokes in a minute, when the patients &s;tand up or endeavour to walk; and &s;ub&s;ides to 110, when they lie down again in their beds. Whence it appears, that when a very quick pul&s;e ac|companies convul&s;ion or in&s;anity, it &s;imply indicates the weakne&s;s of the patient; that is, that the expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power is too great for the &s;upply of it. But if the &s;trength of the patient is not previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted, the exertions of the mu&s;cles are attended with temporary increa&s;e of circulation, the reciprocal &s;wellings and elonga|tions of their bellies pu&s;h forwards the arterial blood, and promote the ab&s;orption of the venous blood; whence a temporary increa&s;e of &s;ecre|tion and of heat, and a &s;tronger pul&s;e.</P>

But there is another re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, which ap|proaches towards writhing or contortions of the body, which is a voluntary effort to relieve pain; and may be e&s;teemed a &s;lighter kind of convul&s;ion, not totally unre&s;trainable by oppo&s;ite or counter|acting volitions.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Tremor febrilis.</HI> Reciprocal convul&s;ions of the &s;ubcutaneous mu&s;cles, originating from the pain of the &s;en&s;e of heat, owing to de|fect of its u&s;ual &s;timulus, and con&s;equent accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in it. The actual deficiency of heat may exi&s;t in one part of the body, and the pain of cold be felt mo&s;t vividly in &s;ome other part a&s;&s;ociated with it by &s;en&s;itive &s;ympathy. So a chillne&s;s down the back is fir&s;t attended to in ague-fits, though the di&s;ea&s;e perhaps com|mences with the torpor and con&s;equent coldne&s;s of &s;ome internal vi&s;cus. But in whatever part of the &s;y&s;tem the defect of heat exi&s;ts, or the &s;en&s;ation of it, the convul&s;ions of the &s;ubcutaneous mu&s;cles exerted to relieve it are very general; and, if the pain is &s;till greater, a chattering of the teeth is added, the more &s;uddenly to exhau&s;t the &s;en&s;orial power, and becau&s;e the teeth are very &s;en&s;ible to cold.</P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>Clamor.</HI> Screaming from pain. The talkative animals, as dogs, and &s;wine, and children, &s;cream mo&s;t, when they are in pain, and even from fear; as they have u&s;ed this kind of exertion from their birth mo&s;t frequently and mo&s;t forcibly; and can therefore &s;ooner exhau&s;t the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the affected mu&s;cular or &s;en&s;ual organs by this mode of exertion; as de&s;cribed in Sect. XXXIV. 1. 3. This facility of relieving pain by &s;creaming is the &s;ource of laughter, as explained below.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Ri&s;us.</HI> The plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations, which occa&s;ion laughter, are perpetually pa&s;&s;ing into the bounds of pain; for plea&s;ure and pain are often produced by different degrees of the &s;ame &s;timulus; as warmth, light, aromatic or volatile odours, become painful by their exce&s;s; and the tickling on the &s;oles of the feet in children is a painful &s;en&s;a|tion at the very time it produces laughter. When the plea&s;urable ideas, which excite us to laugh, pa&s;s into pain, we u&s;e &s;ome exertion, as a &s;cream, to relieve the pain, but &s;oon &s;top it again, as we are un|willing to lo&s;e the plea&s;ure; and thus we repeatedly begin to &s;cream, and &s;top again alternately. So that in laughing there are three &s;tages, fir&s;t of plea&s;ure, then pain, then an exertion to relieve that pain. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 3.</P>
<P>Every one has been in a &s;ituation, where &s;ome ludicrous circum|&s;tance has excited him to laugh; and at the &s;ame time a &s;en&s;e of de|corum has forbid the exertion of the&s;e interrupted &s;creams; and then the pain has become &s;o violent, as to occa&s;ion him to u&s;e &s;ome other great action, as biting his tongue, and pinching him&s;elf, in lieu of the reiterated &s;creams which con&s;titute laughter.</P>

When the&s;e convul&s;ive motions bend the body forwards, they are termed empro&s;thotonoi; when they bend it backward, they are termed opi&s;thotonoi. They frequently &s;ucceed each other, but the opi&s;thotonoi are generally more violent; as the mu&s;cles, which erect the body, and keep it erect, are naturally in more con&s;tant and more forcible action than their antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of convul&s;ion are very numerous, as from toothing in children, from worms or acidity in their bowels, from eruption of the di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox, and la&s;tly, from breathing too long the air of an unventilated bed-room. Sir G. Baker, in the Tran&s;actions of the College, de&s;cribed this di&s;ea&s;e, and detected its cau&s;e; where many children in an orphan-hou&s;e were crowded together in one chamber without a chimney, and were almo&s;t all of them affected with con|vul&s;ion; in the ho&s;pital at Dublin, many died of convul&s;ions before the real cau&s;e was under&s;tood. See Dr. Beddoes's Guide to Self-pre|&s;ervation. In a large family, which I attended, where many female &s;ervants &s;lept in one room, which they had contrived to render ina$|ce&s;&s;ible to every bla&s;t of air; I &s;aw four who were thus &s;eiz$d with convul&s;ions, and who were believed to have been affected by &s;ym|pathy from the fir&s;t who fell ill. They were removed into more airy apartments, but were &s;ome weeks before they all regained their perfect health.</P>
<P>Convul&s;ion is di&s;tingui&s;hed from epilep&s;y, as the patient does not intirely lo&s;e all perception during the paroxy&s;m. Which only &s;hews, that a le&s;s exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power renders tolerable the pains which cau&s;e convul&s;ion, than tho&s;e which cau&s;e epilep&s;y.

by the pre&s;ence of the expectation of death, which precedes and &s;uc|ceeds them, and generally by a flow of pale urine; the&s;e convul&s;ions do not con&s;tantly attend the hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e, but are occa&s;ionally &s;u|perinduced by the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation ari&s;ing from the torpor or in|ver&s;ion of a part of the alimentary canal. Whence the convul&s;ion of laughter is frequently &s;ufficient to re&s;train the&s;e hy&s;teric pains, which accounts for the fits of laughter frequently attendant on this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>Convul&s;io debilis.</HI> The convul&s;ions of dying animals, as of tho&s;e which are bleeding to death in the &s;laughter-hou&s;e, are an effort to relieve painful &s;en&s;ation, either of the wound which occa&s;ions their death, or of faintne&s;s from want of due di&s;tention of the blood-ve&s;&s;els. Similar to this in a le&s;s degree is the &s;ub&s;ultus tendinum, or &s;tarting of the tendons, in fevers with debility; the&s;e actions of the mu&s;cles are too weak to move the limb, but the belly of the acting mu&s;cles is &s;een to &s;well, and the tendon to be &s;tretched. The&s;e weak convul|&s;ions, as they are occa&s;ioned by the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation of faintne&s;s from inanition, are &s;ymptoms of great general debility, and thence frequently pr$cede the general convul&s;ions of the act of dying.

<P>It has al&s;o been improperly called nervous rheumati&s;m; but is di&s;|tingui&s;hed from rheumati&s;m, as the pains recur by periods once or twice a day; whereas in the chronic rheumati&s;m they only occur on moving the affected mu&s;cles. And by the warmth of a bed the pains of the chronic rheumati&s;m are increa&s;ed, as the mu&s;cles or membranes then become more &s;en&s;ible to the &s;timulus of the extraneous muca|ginous material depo&s;ited under them. Whereas the pains of the ra|phania, or painful convul&s;ion, commence with coldne&s;s of the part, or of the extremities. See Rheumati&s;mus chronicus, Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 12.</P>
<P>The pains which accompany the contractions of the mu&s;cles in this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eem to ari&s;e from the too great violence of tho&s;e con|tractions, as happens in the cramp of the calf of the leg; from which they differ in tho&s;e being fixed, and the&s;e being reiterated contractions. Thus the&s;e convul&s;ions are generally of the lower limbs, and recur at periodical times from &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation from defect of action, like other periodic di&s;ea&s;es; and the convul&s;ions of the limbs relieve the original unea&s;y painful &s;en&s;ation, and then produce a greater pain from their own too vehement contractions. There is however an|other way of accounting for the&s;e pains, when they &s;ucceed the acute rheumati&s;m; and that is by the coagulable lymph, which may be left &s;till unab&s;orbed on the membranes; and which may be in too &s;mall quantity to affect them with pain in common mu&s;cular exertions, but may produce great pain, when the bellies of the mu&s;cles &s;well to a larger bulk in violent action.</P>

<P N="7">7. <HI>Epilep&s;ia</HI> is originally induced, like other convul&s;ions, by a volun|tary exertion to relieve &s;ome pain. This pain is mo&s;t frequently about the pit of the &s;tomach, or termination of the bile-duct; and in &s;ome ca&s;es the torpor of the &s;tomach, which probably occa&s;ioned the epileptic fits, remains afterwards, and produces a chronical anorexia; of which a ca&s;e is related in Cla&s;s II. 2. 2. 1. There are in&s;tances of its beginning in the heel, of which a ca&s;e is publi&s;hed by Dr. Short, in the Med. E&s;&s;ays, Edinb. I once &s;aw a child about ten years old, who frequently fell down in convul&s;ions, as &s;he was running about in play; on examination a wart was found on one ancle, which was ragged and inflamed; which was directed to be cut off, and the fits never recurred.</P>
<P>When epilep&s;y fir&s;t commences, the patients are liable to utter one &s;cream before they fall down; afterwards the convul&s;ions &s;o immedi|ately follow the pain, which occa&s;ions them, that the patient does not recollect or &s;eem &s;en&s;ible of the preceding pain. Thus in laughter, when it is not exce&s;&s;ive, a per&s;on is not con&s;cious of the pain, which &s;o often recurs, and cau&s;es the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;creams or exertions of laughter, which give a temporary relief to it.</P>
<P>Epileptic fits frequently recur in &s;leep from the increa&s;e of &s;en&s;ibi|lity at that time, explained in Sect. XVIII. 14. In two &s;uch ca&s;es, both of young women, one grain of opium given at night, and con|tinued many months, had &s;ucce&s;s; in one of them the opium was omitted twice at different times, and the fit recurred on both the nights. In the more violent ca&s;e, de&s;cribed in Sect. XVIII. 15, opium had no effect.</P>
<P>Epileptic &s;its generally commence with &s;etting the teeth, by which means the tongue is frequently wounded; and with rolling the eye|balls in every kind of direction; for the mu&s;cles which &s;u&s;pend the
<PB N="330" REF="3400">
jaw, as well as tho&s;e which move the eyes, are in p$rpetual motion during our waking hours; and yet continue &s;ub&s;ervient to voli|tion; hence their more facile and forcible actions for the purpo&s;e of relieving pain by the exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power. See Section XXXIV. 1. 4.</P>
<P>Epileptic convul&s;ions are not attended with the fear of death, as in the hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e, and the urine is of a &s;traw colour. However it mu&s;t be noted, that the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations in hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;es &s;ometimes are the cau&s;e of true epileptic convul&s;ions, of &s;yncope, and of madne&s;s.</P>
<P>The pain, which occa&s;ions &s;ome fits of epilep&s;y, is felt for a time in a di&s;tant part of the &s;y&s;tem, as in a toe or heel; and is &s;aid by the patient gradually to a&s;cend to the head, before the general convul&s;ions commence. This a&s;cending &s;en&s;ation has been called aura epileptica, and is &s;aid to have been prevented from affecting the head by a tight bandage round the limb. In this malady the pain, probably of &s;ome torpid membrane, or di&s;ea&s;ed tendon, is at fir&s;t only &s;o great as to in|duce &s;light &s;pa&s;ms of the mu&s;cular fibres in its vicinity; which &s;light &s;pa&s;ms cea&s;e on the numbne&s;s introduced by a tight bandage; when no bandage is applied, the pain gradually increa&s;es, till generally con|vul&s;ions are exerted to relieve it. The cour&s;e of a lymphatic, as when poi&s;onous matter is ab&s;orbed; or of a nerve, as in the &s;ciatica, may, by the &s;ympathy exi&s;ting between their extremities and origins, give an idea of the a&s;cent of an aura or vapour.</P>
<P>In difficult parturition it &s;ometimes happens, that general convul|&s;ions are excited to relieve the pain of labour, in&s;tead of the exertions of tho&s;e mu&s;cles of the abdomen and diaphragm, which ought to for|ward the exclu&s;ion of the child. See Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. That is, in|&s;tead of the particular mu&s;cular actions, which ought to be excited by &s;en&s;ation to remove the o&s;&s;ending cau&s;e, general convul&s;ions are pro|duced by the power of volition, which &s;till the pain, as in common epilep&s;y, without removing the cau&s;e; and, as the parturition is not thus promoted, the convul&s;ions continue, till the &s;en&s;orial power is

totally exhau&s;ted, that is, till death. In patients afflicted with epi|lep&s;y from other cau&s;es, I have &s;een the mo&s;t violent convul&s;ions recur frequently during pregnancy without mi&s;carriage, as they did not tend to forward the exclu&s;ion of the fetus.</P>

<P>The later in life epileptic fits are fir&s;t experienced, the more dan|gerous they may be e&s;teemed in general; as in the&s;e cafes the cau&s;e has generally been acquired by the habits of the patient, or by the de|cay of &s;ome part, and is thus probably in an increa&s;ing &s;tate. Where|as in children the changes in the &s;y&s;tem, as they advance to puberty, &s;ometimes removes the cau&s;e. So in toothing, fits of convul&s;ion with &s;tupor frequently occur, and cea&s;e when the tooth advances; but this is not to be expected in advanced life. Sir&mdash;, about &s;ixty years of age, had only three teeth left in his upper jaw, a canine tooth, and one on each &s;ide of it. He was &s;eized with epileptic fits, with pain commencing in the&s;e teeth. He was urged to have them extracted, which he delayed too long, till the fits were become ha|bitual, and then had them extracted in vain, and in a few months &s;unk under the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. F&mdash;, who had lived intemperately, and had been occa&s;ion|ally affected with the gout, was &s;uddenly &s;eized with epileptic fits; the convul&s;ions were &s;ucceeded by apoplectic &s;noring; from which he was, in about 20 minutes, di&s;turbed by fre&s;h convul&s;ions, and had continued in this &s;ituation above four-and-twenty hours. About eight ounces of blood were then taken from him; and after having ob&s;erved, that the apoplectic's torpor continued about 20 minutes, I directed him to be forcibly rai&s;ed up in bed, after he had thus lain about fifteen minutes, to gain an interval between the termination of the &s;leep, and the renovation of convul&s;ion. In this interval he was induced to &s;wallow forty drops of laudanum. Twenty more were given him in the &s;ame manner in about half an hour, both which evidently &s;hortened the convul&s;ion fits, and the con&s;equent &s;tupor; he then took thirty more drops, which for the pre&s;ent removed the
<PB N="332" REF="3420">
fits. He became rather in&s;ane the next day, and after about three more days lo&s;t the in&s;anity, and recovered his u&s;ual &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e mentioned in Sect. XXVII. 2. where the patient was left after epileptic fits with a &s;uffu&s;ion of blood beneath the tunica ad|junctiva of the eye, was in almo&s;t every re&s;pect &s;imilar to the pre|ceding, and &s;ubmitted to the &s;ame treatment. Both of them &s;uffered frequent relap&s;es, which were relieved by the &s;ame means, and at length peri&s;hed, I believe, by the epileptic fits.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e patients, who have not been &s;ubject to epilep&s;y before they have arrived to about forty years of age, and who have been intem|perate in re&s;pect to &s;pirituous potation, I have been induced to believe, that the fits were occa&s;ioned by the pain of a di&s;ea&s;ed liver; and this became more probable in one of the above &s;ubjects, who had u&s;ed means to repel eruptions on the face; and thus by &s;ome &s;timulant applica|tion had prevented an inflammation taking place on the &s;kin of the face in&s;tead of on &s;ome part of the liver. Secondly, as in the&s;e ca&s;es in&s;anity had repeatedly occurred, which could not be traced from an he|reditary &s;ource; there is rea&s;on to believe, that this as well as the epi|leptic convul&s;ions were cau&s;ed by &s;pirituous potation; and that this therefore is the original &s;ource both of epilep&s;y and of in&s;anity in tho&s;e families, which are afflicted with them. This idea however brings &s;ome con&s;olation with it; as it may be inferred, that in a few &s;ober generations the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es may be eradicated, which otherwi&s;e de&s;troy the family.</P>

<P>This di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes originates from a pain about the lower edge of the liver, &s;ometimes in the temple, and &s;ometimes in the puden|dum; it recurs daily for five or &s;ix weeks, and then cea&s;es for &s;everal months. The pain is owing to defect of action, that is, to the ac|cumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the part, which probably &s;ympathizes with &s;ome other part, as explained in Sect. XXXV. 2. XII. 5. 3. and Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 11. and IV. 2. 2. 3.</P>
<P>It is the mo&s;t painful malady that human nature is liable to!&mdash;See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.</P>
<P>Mrs. C&mdash;was &s;eized every day about the &s;ame hour with violent pain on the right &s;ide of her bowels about the &s;ituation of the lower edge of the liver, without fever, which increa&s;ed for an hour or two, till it became totally intolerable. After violent &s;creaming &s;he fell into convul&s;ions, which terminated &s;ometimes in fainting, with or with|out &s;tertor, as in common epilep&s;y; at other times a tempory in&s;anity &s;upervened; which continued about half an hour, and the fit cea&s;ed. The&s;e paroxy&s;ms had returned daily for two or three weeks, and were at length removed by large do&s;es of opium, like the fits of reverie or &s;omnambulation. About half an hour before the expected return of the fit three or four grains of opium were exhibited, and then tincture of opium was given in warm brandy and water about 20 or 30 drops every half hour, till the eyes became &s;omewhat inflamed, and the no&s;e began to itch, and by the &s;harp movements of the patient, or quick &s;peech, an evident intoxication appeared; and then it generally happened that the pain cea&s;ed. But the effects of this large do&s;e of opium was &s;ucceeded by perpetual &s;ickne&s;s and efforts to vomit, with great general debility all the &s;ucceeding day.</P>
<P>The rationale of this temporary cure from the exhibition of opium and vinous &s;pirit depends on the great expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power in the increa&s;ed actions of all the irritative motions, by the &s;timulus of &s;uch large quantities of opium and vinous &s;pirit; together with the
<PB N="334" REF="3440">
production of much &s;en&s;ation, and many movements of the organs of &s;en&s;e or ideas in con&s;equence of that &s;en&s;ation; and la&s;tly, even the motions of the arterial &s;y&s;tem become accelerated by this degree of in|toxication, all which &s;oon exhau&s;ted &s;o much &s;en&s;orial power as to relieve the pain; which would otherwi&s;e have cau&s;ed convul&s;ions or in&s;anity, which are other means of expending &s;en&s;orial power. The general debility on the &s;ucceeding day, and the particular debility of the &s;tomach, attended in con&s;equence with &s;ickne&s;s and frequent ef|forts to vomit, were occa&s;ioned by the &s;y&s;tem having previou&s;ly been &s;o &s;trongly &s;timulated, and tho&s;e parts in particular on which the opium and wine more immediately acted. This &s;ickne&s;s continued &s;o many hours as to break the catenation of motions, which had daily reproduced the paroxy&s;m; and thus it generally happened, that the whole di&s;ea&s;e cea&s;ed for &s;ome weeks or months from one great intoxi|cation, a circum&s;tance not ea&s;ily to be explained on any other theory.</P>
<P>The exce&s;s or defect of motion in any part of the &s;y&s;tem occa&s;ions the production of pain in that part, as in Sect. XII. 1. 6. This defect or exce&s;s of fibrous action is generally induced by exce&s;s or defect of the &s;timulus of objects external to the moving organ. But there is another &s;ource of exce&s;&s;ive fibrous action, and con&s;equent pain, which is from exce&s;s of volition, which is liable to affect tho&s;e mu&s;cles, that have weak antagoni&s;ts; as tho&s;e which &s;upport the under jaw, and clo&s;e the mouth in biting, and tho&s;e of the calf of the leg; which are thus liable to fixed or painful contractions, as in tri&s;mus, or locked jaw, and in the cramp of the calf of the leg; and perhaps in &s;ome colics, as in that of Japan: the&s;e pains, from contraction ari&s;ing from exce&s;s of volition in the part from the want of the counteraction of antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles, may give occa&s;ional cau&s;e to epileptic fits, and may be relieved in the &s;ame way, either by exciting irritative and &s;en&s;itive motions by the &s;timulus of opium and wine; or by convul|&s;ions or in&s;anity, as de&s;cribed above, which are only different methods of exhau&s;ting the general quantity of &s;en&s;orial power.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="3450">
Con&s;idering the great re&s;emblance between this kind of painful epilep&s;y and the colic of Japan, as de&s;cribed by Kemfer; and that that di&s;ea&s;e was &s;aid to be cured by acupuncture, or the prick of a needle; I directed &s;ome very thin &s;teel needles to be made about three inches long, and of &s;uch a temper, that they would bend double rather than break; and wrapped wax thread over about half an inch of the blunt end for a handle. One of the&s;e needles, when the pain occurred, was pu&s;hed about an inch into the painful part, and the pain in&s;tantly cea&s;ed; but I was not certain, whether the fear of the patient, or the &s;timulus of the puncture, occa&s;ioned the ce&s;&s;ation of pain; and as the paroxy&s;m had continued &s;ome weeks, and was then declining, the experiment was not tried again. The di&s;ea&s;e is &s;aid to be very frequent in Japan, and its &s;eat to be in the bowels, and that the acupuncture eliminates the air, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to di&s;tend the bowel. But though the aperture thus made is too &s;mall to admit of the eduction of air; yet as the &s;timulus of &s;o &s;mall a puncture may either excite a torpid part into action, or cau&s;e a &s;pa&s;modic one to cea&s;e to act; and la&s;tly, as no injury could be likely to en&s;ue from &s;o &s;mall a perforation, I &s;hould be inclined at &s;ome future time to give this a fairer trial in &s;imilar circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Another thing worth trial at the commencement of this deplorable di&s;ea&s;e would be electricity, by pa&s;&s;ing &s;trong &s;hocks through the painful part; which, whether the pain was owing to the inaction of that part, or of &s;ome other membrane a&s;&s;ociated with it, might &s;ti|mulate them into exertion; or into inactivity, if owing to fixed pain|ful contraction.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, the cold bath, or a&s;per&s;ions with cold water on the af|fected part, according to the method of Dr. Currie in the Memoirs of a Med. Soc. London, V. iii. p. 147, might produce great effect at the commencement of the pain. Neverthele&s;s opium duly admi|ni&s;tered, &s;o as to precede the expected paroxy&s;m, and in &s;uch do&s;es, given by degrees, as to induce intoxication, is principally to be de|pended upon in this deplorable malady. To which &s;hould be added,
<PB N="336" REF="3460">
that if vene&s;ection can be previou&s;ly performed, even to but few ounces, the effect of the opium is much more certain; and &s;till more &s;o, if there be time to premi&s;e a bri&s;k cathartic, or even an emetic. The effect of increa&s;ed &s;timulus is &s;o much greater after previous de|fect of &s;timulus; and this is &s;till of greater advantage where the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e happens to con&s;i&s;t in a material, which can be ab&s;orbed.

In this malady the patients have only the general appearance of being a&s;leep in re&s;pect to their inatten|tion to the &s;timulus of external objects, but, like the epilep&s;ies above de&s;cribed, it con&s;i&s;ts in voluntary exertions to relieve pain. The mu&s;cles are &s;ub&s;ervient to the will, as appears by the patient's walk|ing about, and &s;ometimes doing the common offices of life. The ideas of the mind al&s;o are obedient to the will, becau&s;e their di&s;cour&s;e is con&s;i&s;tent, though they an&s;wer imaginary que&s;tions. The irrita|tive ideas of external objects continue in this malady, becau&s;e the pa|tients do not run again&s;t the furniture of the room; and when they apply their volition to their organs of &s;en&s;e, they become &s;en&s;ible of the objects they attend to, but not otherwi&s;e, as general &s;en&s;ation is de&s;troyed by the violence of their voluntary exertions.

XXXIV. 3. 1. where a hi&s;tory of a hunting &s;cene was voluntarily recalled, with all the plea&s;urable ideas which attended it. In melan|choly madne&s;s the patient is employed in voluntarily exciting one idea, with tho&s;e which are connected with it by voluntary a&s;&s;ociations only, but not &s;o violently as to exclude the &s;timuli of external objects. In reverie variety of ideas are occa&s;ionally excited by volition, and tho&s;e which are connected with them either by &s;en&s;itive or voluntary a&s;&s;ociations, and that &s;o violently as to exclude the &s;timuli of external objects. The&s;e two &s;ituations of our &s;en&s;ual motions, or ideas, re|&s;emble convul&s;ion and epilep&s;y; as in the former the &s;timulus of ex|ternal objects is &s;till perceived, but not in the latter. Whence this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o far from being connected with &s;leep, though it has by uni|ver&s;al mi&s;take acquired its name from it, ari&s;es from exce&s;s of voli|tion, and not from a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of it; and though, like other kinds of epilep&s;y, it often attacks the patients in their &s;$eep, yet tho&s;e two, whom I &s;aw, were more frequently &s;eized with it while awake, the &s;leep-walking being a part of the reverie.

<P N="10">10. <HI>A&s;thma convul&s;ivum.</HI> The fits of convul&s;ive a&s;thma return at periods, and are attended with cold extremities, and &s;o far re&s;emble the acce&s;s of an intermittent fever; but, as the lungs are not &s;en&s;ible to the pain of cold, a &s;hivering does not &s;ucceed, but in&s;tead of it violent efforts of re&s;piration; which have no tendency, as in the humoral a&s;thma, to di&s;lodge any offending material, but only to re|lieve the pain by exertion, like the &s;huddering in the beginning of ague-fits, as explained Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. 2.</P>
<P>The in&s;en&s;ibility of the lungs to cold is ob&s;ervable on going into fro&s;ty air from a warm room; the hands and face become painfully cold, but no &s;uch &s;en&s;ation is excited in the lungs; which is another argument in favour of the exi&s;tence of a peculiar &s;et of nerves for the
<PB N="338" REF="3480">
purpo&s;e of perceiving the univer&s;al fluid matter of heat$ in which all things are immer&s;ed. See Sect. XIV. 6. Yet are the lungs never|thele&s;s very &s;en&s;ible to the deficiency of oxygen in the atmo&s;phere, as all people experience, when they go into a room crowded with company and candles, and complain, that it is &s;o clo&s;e, they can &s;carcely breathe; and the &s;ame in &s;ome hot days in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>There are two di&s;ea&s;es, which bear the name of a&s;thma. The fir&s;t is the torpor or inability of the minute ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, con|&s;i&s;ting of the terminations of the pulmonary and bronchial arteries and veins, and their attendant lymphatics; in this circum&s;tance it re|&s;embles the difficulty of breathing, which attends cold bathing. If this continues long, a conge&s;tion of fluid in the air-cells &s;ucceeds, as the ab&s;orbent actions cea&s;e completely before the &s;ecerning ones; as explained in Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 3. And the coldne&s;s, which attends the inaction of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, prevents the u&s;ual quantity of exhalation. Some fits cea&s;e before this conge&s;tion takes place, and in them no vio|lent &s;weating nor any expuition of phlegm occurs. This is the hu|moral a&s;thma, de&s;cribed at Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 7.</P>
<P>The &s;econd kind of a&s;thma con&s;i&s;ts in the convul&s;ive actions in con&s;equence of the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;tions thus induced; which in &s;ome fits of a&s;thma are very great, as appears in the violent efforts to rai&s;e the ribs, and to depre&s;s the diaphragm, by lifting the &s;houlders. The&s;e, &s;o long as they contribute to remove the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, are not properly convul&s;ions, but exertions immediately cau&s;ed by &s;en&s;ation; but in this kind of a&s;thma they are only efforts to relieve pain, and are frequently preceded by other epileptic convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e two kinds of a&s;thmas have &s;o many re&s;embling features, and are &s;o frequently intermixed, that it often requires great attention to di&s;tingui&s;h them; but as one of them is allied to ana&s;arca, and the other to epilep&s;y, we &s;hall acquire a clearer idea of them by com|paring them with tho&s;e di&s;orders. A criterion of the humoral or hy|dropic a&s;thma is, that it is relieved by copious &s;weats about the head
<PB N="339" REF="3490">
and brea&s;t, which are to be a&s;cribed to the &s;en&s;itive exertions of the pulmonary ve&s;&s;els to relieve the pain occa&s;ioned by the ana&s;arcous conge&s;tion in the air-cells; and which is effected by the increa&s;ed ab|&s;orption of the mucus, and its elimination by the retrograde action of tho&s;e lymphatics of the &s;kin, who&s;e branches communicate with the pulmonary ones; and which partial &s;weats do not ea&s;ily admit of any other explanation. See Cla&s;s I. 3. 2. 8. Another criterion of it is, that it is generally attended with &s;welled legs, or other &s;ymptoms of ana&s;arca. A criterion of the convul&s;ive a&s;thma may be had from the ab&s;ence of the&s;e cold clammy &s;weats of the upper part of the body only, and from the patient having occa&s;ionally been &s;ubject to con|vul&s;ions of the limbs, as in the common epilep&s;y.</P>
<P>It may thus frequently happen, that in the humoral a&s;thma &s;ome exertions of the lungs may occur, which may not contribute to di&s;|charge the ana&s;arcous lymph, but may be efforts &s;imply to relieve pain; be&s;ides tho&s;e efforts, which produce the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption and elimination of it; and thus we have a bodily di&s;ea&s;e re&s;embling in this circum&s;tance the reverie, in which both &s;en&s;itive and voluntary motions are at the &s;ame time, or in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, excited for the pur|po&s;e of relieving pain.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e &s;ometimes happen, that the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, occa&s;ioned by the conge&s;tion of lymph in the air-cells in the humoral or hydropic a&s;thma, may induce voluntary convul&s;ions of the re&s;pira|tory organs only to relieve the pain, without any &s;en&s;itive actions of the pulmonary ab&s;orbents to ab&s;orb and eliminate the conge&s;tion of &s;erous fluid; and thus the &s;ame cau&s;e may occa&s;ionally induce either the humoral or convul&s;ive a&s;thma.</P>
<P>The humoral a&s;thma has but one remote cau&s;e, which is the torpor of the pulmonary ve&s;&s;els, like that which occurs on going into the cold bath; or the want of ab&s;orption of the pulmonary lymphatics to take up the lymph effu&s;ed into the air-cell. Whereas the convul&s;ive a&s;thma, like other convul&s;ions, or epilep&s;ies, may be occa&s;ioned by
<PB N="340" REF="3500">
pain in almo&s;t any remote part of the &s;y&s;tem. But in &s;ome of the adult patients in this di&s;ea&s;e, as in many epilep&s;ies, I have &s;u&s;pected the remote cau&s;e to be a pain of the liver, or of the biliary ducts.</P>
<P>The a&s;thmas, which have been induced in con&s;equence of the re|ce&s;s of eruptions, e&s;pecially of the leprous kind, countenance this opinion. One lady I knew, who for many years laboured under an a&s;thma, which cea&s;ed on her being afflicted with pain, &s;welling, and di&s;tortion of &s;ome of her large joints, which were e&s;teemed gouty, but perhaps erroneou&s;ly. And a young man, whom I &s;aw ye&s;terday, was &s;eized with a&s;thma on the retroce&s;&s;ion, or cea&s;ing of eruptions on his face.</P>
<P>The convul&s;ive a&s;thma, as well as the hydropic, are more liable to return in hot weather; which may be occa&s;ioned by the le&s;s quantity of oxygen exi&s;ting in a given quantity of warm air, than of cold, which can be taken into the lungs at one in&s;piration. They are both mo&s;t liable to occur after the fir&s;t &s;leep, which is therefore a general $riterion of a&s;thma. The cau&s;e of this is explained in Sect. XVIII. 15. and applied to both of them, as our &s;en&s;ibility to internal unea&s;y &s;en&s;a|tion increa&s;es during &s;leep.</P>
<P>When children are gaining teeth, long before they appear, the pain of the gums often induces convul&s;ions. This pain is relieved in &s;ome by &s;obbing and &s;creaming; but in others a laborious re&s;piration is ex|erted to relieve the pain; and this con&s;titutes the true a&s;thma convul|&s;ivum. In other children again general convul&s;ions, or epileptic pa|roxy&s;ms, are induced for this purpo&s;e; which, like other epilep&s;ies, become e&s;tabli&s;hed by habit, and recur before the irritation has time to produce the painful &s;en&s;ation, which originally cau&s;ed them.</P>
<P>The a&s;thma convul&s;ivum is al&s;o &s;ometimes induced by worms, or by acidity in the &s;tomachs of children, and by other painful &s;en&s;ations in adults; in whom it is generally called nervous a&s;thma, and is oft$$ joined with other epileptic &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>This a&s;thma is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the peripneumony, and from
<PB N="341" REF="3510">
the croup, by the pre&s;ence of fever in the two latter. It is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the humoral a&s;thma, as in that the patients are more liable to run to the cold air for relief, are more &s;ubject to cold extre|mities, and experience the returns of it more frequently after their fir&s;t &s;leep. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the hydrops thoracis, as that has no intervals, and the patient &s;its con&s;tantly upright, and the breath is colder; and, where the pericardium is affected, the pul&s;e is quick and unequal. See Hydrops Thoracis, I. 2. 3. 14.</P>
<P>M. M. Vene&s;ection once. A cathartic with calomel once. Opium. A&s;&s;afaetida. Warm bath. If the cau&s;e can be detected, as in toothing or worms, it &s;hould be removed. As this &s;pecies of a&s;thma is &s;o li|able to recur during &s;leep, like epileptic fits, as mentioned in Section XVIII. 15. there was rea&s;on to believe, that the re&s;piration of an at|mo&s;phere mixed with hydrogen, or any other innocuous air, which might dilute the oxygen, would be u&s;eful in preventing the parox|y&s;ms by decrea&s;ing the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;y&s;tem. This, I am informed by Dr. Beddoes, has been u&s;ed with decided &s;ucce&s;s by Dr. Ferriar. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 7.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>A&s;thma dolorificum.</HI> Angina pectoris. The painful a&s;thma was fir&s;t de&s;cribed by Dr. Heberden in the Tran&s;actions of the Col|lege; its principal &s;ymptoms con&s;i&s;t in a pain about the middle of the &s;ternum, or rather lower, on every increa&s;e of pulmonary or mu&s;cu|lar exertion, as in walking fa&s;ter than u&s;ual, or going quick up a hill, or even up &s;tairs; with great difficulty of breathing, &s;o as to occa&s;ion the patient in&s;tantly to &s;top. A pain in the arms about the in&s;ertion of the tendon of the pectoral mu&s;cle generally attends, and a de&s;ire of re&s;ting by hanging on a door or branch of a tree by the arms is &s;ometimes ob&s;erved. Which is explained in Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 14. and in Sect. XXIX. 5. 2.</P>
<P>The&s;e patients generally die &s;uddenly; and on examining the tho|rax no certain cau&s;e, or &s;eat, of the di&s;ea&s;e has been detected; &s;ome
<PB N="342" REF="3520">
have &s;uppo&s;ed the valves of the arteries, or of the heart, were imper|fect; and others that the accumulation of fat about this vi&s;cus or the lungs ob&s;tructed their due action; but other ob&s;ervations do not accord with the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Mr. W&mdash;, an elderly gentleman, was &s;eized with a&s;thma during the hot part of la&s;t &s;ummer; he always waked from his fir&s;t &s;leep with difficult re&s;piration, and pain in the middle of his &s;ternum, and after about an hour was enabled to &s;leep again. As this had returned for about a fortnight, it appeared to me to be an a&s;thma complicated with the di&s;ea&s;e, which Dr. Heberden has called angina pectoris. It was treated by vene&s;ection, a cathartic, and then by a grain of opium given at going to bed, with ether and tincture of opium when the pain or a&s;thma recurred, and la&s;tly with the bark, but was &s;everal days before it was perfectly &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>This led me to conceive, that in this painful a&s;thma the diaphragm, as well as the other mu&s;cles of re&s;piration, was thrown into convul|&s;ive action, and that the fibres of this mu&s;cle not having proper anta|goni&s;ts, a painful fixed &s;pa&s;m of it, like that of the mu&s;cles in the calf of the leg in the cramp, might be the cau&s;e of death in the angina pectoris, which I have thence arranged under the name of painful a&s;thma, and leave for further inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>From the hi&s;tory of the ca&s;e of the late much lamented John Huter, and from the appearances after death, the ca&s;e &s;eems to have been of this kind, complicated with vertigo and con&s;equent affection of the &s;tomach. The remote cau&s;e &s;eems to have ari&s;en from o&s;&s;ifi|cations of the coronary arteries; and the immediate cau&s;e of his death from fixed &s;pa&s;m of the heart. Other hi&s;tories and di&s;&s;ections are &s;till required to put this matter out of doubt; as it is po&s;&s;ible, that either a fixed &s;pa&s;m of the diaphragm, or of the heart, which are both fur|ni&s;hed with but weak antagoni&s;ts, may occa&s;ion &s;udden death; and the&s;e may con&s;titute two di&s;tinct di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Four patients I have now in my recollection, all of whom I believed
<PB N="343" REF="3530">
to labour under the angina pectoris in a great degree; which have all recovered, and have continued well three or four years by the u&s;e, as I believe, of i&s;&s;ues on the in&s;ide of each thigh; which were at fir&s;t large enough to contain two pea&s;e each, and afterwards but one. They took be&s;ides &s;ome &s;light antimonial medicine for a while, and were reduced to half the quantity or &s;trength of their u&s;ual potation of fermented liquor.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of femoral i&s;&s;ues in angina pectoris was fir&s;t recommended by Dr. Macbride, phy&s;ician at Dublin, Med. Ob&s;erv. &amp; Enquir. Vol. VI. And I was further induced to make trial of them, not only becau&s;e the means which I had before u&s;ed were inadequate, but from the ill effect I once ob&s;erved upon the lungs, which &s;ucceeded the cure of a &s;mall &s;ore beneath the knee; and argued conver&s;ely, that i&s;&s;ues in the lower limbs might a&s;&s;i&s;t a difficult re|&s;piration.</P>
<P>Mrs. L&mdash;, about fifty, had a &s;mall &s;ore place about the &s;ize of half a pea on the in&s;ide of the leg a little below the knee. It had di&s;|charged a pellucid fluid, which &s;he called a ley water, daily for four|teen years, with a great deal of pain; on which account &s;he applied to a &s;urgeon, who, by means of bandage and a &s;aturnine application, &s;oon healed the &s;ore, unheedful of the con&s;equences. In le&s;s than two months after this I &s;aw her with great difficulty of breathing, which with univer&s;al ana&s;arca &s;oon de&s;troyed her.</P>
<P>The theory of the double effect of i&s;&s;ues, as above related, one in relieving by their pre&s;ence the a&s;thma dolori&s;icum, and the other in producing by its cure an ana&s;arca of the lungs, is not ea&s;y to explain. Some &s;imilar effects from cutaneous eruptions and from bli&s;ters are mentioned in Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 9. In the&s;e ca&s;es it &s;eems probable, that the pain occa&s;ioned by i&s;&s;ues, and perhaps the ab&s;orption of a &s;mall quantity of aerated purulent matter, &s;timulate the whole &s;y&s;tem into greater energy of action, and thus prevent the torpor which is the beginning of &s;o many di&s;ea&s;es. In confirmation of this effect of pain
<PB N="344" REF="3540">
on the &s;y&s;tem, I remember the ca&s;e of a lady of an ingenious and ac|tive mind, who, for many of the latter years of her life, was perpe|tually &s;ubject to great pains of her head from decaying teeth. When all her teeth were gone, &s;he became quite low &s;pirited, and melan|choly in the popular &s;en&s;e of that word, and after a year or two be|came univer&s;ally drop&s;ical and died.</P>
<P>M. M. I&s;&s;ues in the thighs. Five grains of rhubarb, and one &s;ixth of a grain of emetic tartar every night for &s;ome months, with or without half a grain of opium. No &s;tronger liquor than &s;mall beer, or wine diluted with twice its quantity of water. Since I wrote the above I have &s;een two ca&s;es of hydrops thoracis, attended with pain in the left arm, &s;o as to be mi&s;taken for a&s;thma dolorificum, in which femoral i&s;&s;ues, though applied early in the di&s;ea&s;e, had no effect.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Stridor dentium.</HI> The clattering of the teeth on going into cold water, or in the beginning of ague-fits, is an exertion along with the tremblings of the &s;kin to relieve the pain of cold. The teeth and &s;kin being more &s;en&s;ible to cold than the more internal parts, and more expo&s;ed to it, is the rea&s;on that the mu&s;cles, which &s;erve them, are thrown into exertion from the pain of cold rather than tho&s;e of re&s;piration, as in &s;creaming from more acute pain. Thus the poet,</P>

<P>In more acute pains the jaws are gna&s;hed together with great vehe|mence, in&s;omuch that &s;ometimes the teeth are &s;aid to have been broken by the force. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 3. In the&s;e ca&s;es &s;ome|thing &s;hould be offered to the patient to bite, as a towel, otherwi&s;e they are liable to tear their own arms, or to bite their attendants, as I have witne&s;&s;ed in the painful epilep&s;y.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="345" REF="3550">
13. <HI>Tetanus tri&s;mus.</HI> Cramp. The tetanus con&s;i&s;ts of a fixed &s;pa&s;m of almo&s;t all the mu&s;cles of the body; but the tri&s;mus, or locked jaw, is the mo&s;t frequent di&s;ea&s;e of this kind. It is generally believed to ari&s;e from &s;ympathy with an injured tendon. In one ca&s;e where it occurred in con&s;equence of a broken ankle from a fall from a hor&s;e, it was preceded by evident hydrophobia. Amputation was ad|vi&s;ed, but not &s;ubmitted to; two wounds were laid into one with &s;ci&s;&s;ors, but the patient died about the &s;eventh day from the accident. In this ca&s;e the wounded tendon, like the wounds from the bite of a mad dog, did not produce the hydrophobia, and then the locked jaw, till &s;everal days after the accident.</P>
<P>I twice witne&s;&s;ed the locked jaw from a pain beneath the &s;ternum, about the part where it is complained of in painful a&s;thma, or angina pectoris, in the &s;ame lady at &s;ome years di&s;tance of time. The la&s;t time it had continued two days, and &s;he wrote her mind, or expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf by &s;igns. On ob&s;erving a broken tooth, which made a &s;mall aperture into her mouth, I rolled up five grains of opium like a worm about an inch long, and introducing it over the broken tooth, pu&s;hed it onward by means of a &s;mall crow-quill; as it di&s;&s;olved I ob&s;erved &s;he &s;wallowed her &s;aliva, and in le&s;s than half an hour, &s;he opened her mouth and conver&s;ed as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Men are taught to be a&s;hamed of &s;creaming from pain in their early years; hence they are prone to exert the mu&s;cles of the jaws in&s;tead, which they have learnt to exert frequently and violently from their infancy; whence the locked jaw. This and the following &s;pa&s;m have no alternate relaxations, like the preceding ones; which is perhaps owing, fir&s;t, to the weakne&s;s of their antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles, tho&s;e which elevate the jaw being very &s;trong for the purpo&s;e of biting and ma&s;ti|cating hard &s;ub&s;tances, and for &s;upporting the under jaw, with very weak antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles; and &s;econdly, to their not giving &s;ufficient relief even for a moment to the pain, or its preceding irritation, which excited them.</P>

This kind of &s;pa&s;m mo&s;t frequently attacks the calf of the leg, or mu&s;cles of the toes; it often precedes paroxy&s;ms of gout, and appears towards the end of violent diarrhoea, and from indige&s;tion, or from acid diet. In the&s;e ca&s;es it &s;eems to &s;ympathize with the bowels, but is al&s;o frequently produced by the pain of external cold, and to the too great previous exten&s;ion of the mu&s;cles, whence &s;ome people get the cramp in the exten&s;or mu&s;|cles of the toes after walking down hill, and of tho&s;e of the calf of the leg after walking up a &s;teep eminence. For the rea&s;on why the&s;e cramps commence in &s;leep, &s;ee Sect. XVIII. 15.</P>
<P>The mu&s;cle in this di&s;ea&s;e contracts it&s;elf to relieve &s;ome &s;maller pain, either from irritation or a&s;&s;ociation, and then falls into great pain it&s;elf, from the too great action of its own fibres. Hence any mu&s;cle, by being too vehemently exerted, falls into cramp, as in &s;wimming too forcibly in water, which is painfully cold; and a &s;econdary pain is then induced by the too violent contraction of the mu&s;cle; though the pain, which was the cau&s;e of the contraction, cea&s;es. Which ac|counts for the continuance of the contraction, and di&s;tingui&s;hes this di&s;ea&s;e from other convul&s;ions, which are relaxed and exerted alter|nately. Hence whatever may be the cau&s;e of the primary pain, which occa&s;ions the cramp of the calf of the leg, the &s;econdary one is re|lievable by &s;tanding up, and thus by the weight of the body on the
<PB N="347" REF="3570">
toes forcibly extending the contracted mu&s;cles. For the cau&s;e, which induces the&s;e mu&s;cles of the calf of the leg to fail into more violent contraction than other &s;pa&s;modic mu&s;cles, proceeds from the weakne&s;s of their antagoni&s;t mu&s;cles; as they are generally extended again after action by the weight of the body on the balls of the toes.

<P N="15">15. <HI>Hydrophobia.</HI> Dread of water generally attending canine mad|ne&s;s. I was witne&s;s to a ca&s;e, where this di&s;ea&s;e preceded the locked jaw from a wound in the ankle, occa&s;ioned by a fall from a hor&s;e; as mentioned in the preceding article. It came on about the &s;ixth day after the accident; when the patient attempted to &s;wallow fluids, he became convul&s;ed all over from the pain of this attempt, and &s;purted them out of his mouth with violence. It is al&s;o &s;aid to happen in &s;ome hy&s;terical ca&s;es. Hence it &s;eems rather the immediate con&s;e|quence of a pained tendon, than of a contagious poi&s;on. And is &s;o far analogous to tetanus, according with the opinions of Doctor Ru&s;ch and Doctor Percival.</P>
<P>In other re&s;pects, as it is produced by the &s;aliva of an enraged ani|mal in&s;tilled into a wound, it would &s;eem analogous to the poi&s;on of venomous animals. And from the manner of its acce&s;s &s;o long after the bite, and of its termination in a &s;hort time, it would

&s;eem to re&s;emble the progre&s;s of contagious fevers. See Sect. XXII. 3. 3.</P>
<P>If the patient was bitten in a part, which could be totally cut away, as a finger, even after the hydrophobia appears, it is probable it might cure it; as I &s;u&s;pect the cau&s;e &s;till remains in the wounded tendon, and not in a diffu&s;ed infection tainting the blood. Hence there are generally unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, as cold or numbne&s;s, in the old cicatrix, before the hydrophobia commences. See a ca&s;e in Medical Communications, Vol. II. p. 190.</P>
<P>If the di&s;ea&s;ed tendon could be inflamed without cutting it out, as by cupping, or cau&s;tic, or bli&s;ter after cupping, and this in the old would long &s;ince healed, after the hydrophobia commences, might prevent the &s;pa&s;ms about the throat. As inflaming the teeth by the u&s;e of mercury is of u&s;e in &s;ome kinds of hemicrania. Put &s;pirit of turpentine on the wound, wa&s;h it well. See Cla&s;s I. 3. 1. 11. IV. 1. 2. 7.</P>

Put a tight bandage on the limb above the &s;car of the old wound to benumb the pained tendon, however long the wound may have been healed. Could a hollow catheter of ela&s;tic gum, coartchouc, be introduced into the oe&s;ophagus by the mouth or no&s;tril, and liquid nouri&s;hment be thus conveyed into the &s;tomach? See De&s;ault's Journal, Ca&s;e I. where, in an ulcer of the mouth, &s;uch a catheter was introduced by the no&s;tril, and kept in the oe&s;ophagus for a month, by which means the patient was nouri&s;hed and pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>It is recommended by Dr. Bard&s;ley to give oil internally by a &s;imi|lar method contrived by Mr. John Hunter. He covered a probang with the &s;kin of a &s;mall eel, or the gut of a lamb or cat. It was tied up at one end above and below the &s;ponge, and a &s;lit made above the
<PB N="349" REF="3590">
upper ligature; to the other end of the eel-&s;kin or gut was fixed a bladder and pipe. The probang thus covered was introduced into the &s;tomach, and the liquid food or medicine was put into the bladder and &s;queezed down through the eel-&s;kin. Mem. of Society at Manche&s;ter. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 25.</P>
<P>Dr. Bard&s;ley has endeavoured to prove, that dogs never experience the hydrophobia, or canine madne&s;s, without having been previou&s;ly bitten or infected; and &s;econdly, that the di&s;ea&s;e in this &s;pecies of animal always &s;hews it&s;elf in five or &s;ix weeks; and concludes from hence, that this dreadful malady might be annihilated by making all the dogs in Great Britain perform a kind of quarantine, by &s;hutting them up for a certain number of weeks. Though the di&s;ea&s;e from the bite of the mad dog is perhaps more analogous to tho&s;e from the wounds inflicted by venomous animals than to tho&s;e from other con|tagious matter, yet the&s;e ob&s;ervations are well worthy further atten|tion; which the author promi&s;es.</P>

<P>In every &s;pecies of madne&s;s there is a peculiar idea either of de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, which is perpetually excited in the mind with all its connections. In &s;ome con&s;titutions this is connected with plea&s;urable ideas without the exertion of much mu&s;cular action, in others it pro|duces violent mu&s;cular action to gain or avoid the object of it, in others it is attended with de&s;pair and inaction. Mania is the general word for the two former of the&s;e, and melancholia for the latter; but the &s;pecies of them are as numerous as the de&s;ires and aver&s;ions of mankind.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent age the plea&s;urable in&s;anities are mo&s;t frequently in|duced by &s;uper&s;titious hopes of heaven, by &s;entimental love, and by per&s;onal vanity. The furious in&s;anities by pride, anger, revenge, &s;u&s;picion. And the melancholy ones by fear of poverty, fear of death, and fear of hell; with innumerable others.</P>

<P>This idea, however, which induces madne&s;s or melancholy, is ge|nerally untrue; that is, the object is a mi&s;taken fact. As when a patient is per&s;uaded he has the itch, or venereal di&s;ea&s;e, of which he has no &s;ymptom, and becomes mad from the pain this idea occa&s;ions. So that the object of madne&s;s is generally a delirious idea, and thence
<PB N="351" REF="3610">
cannot be conquered by rea&s;on; becau&s;e it continues to be excited by painful &s;en&s;ation, which is a &s;tronger &s;timulus than volition. Mo&s;t frequently pain of body is the cau&s;e of convul&s;ion, which is often however exchanged for madne&s;s; and a painful delirious idea is mo&s;t frequently the cau&s;e of madne&s;s originally, but &s;ometimes of convul|&s;ion. Thus I have &s;een a young lady become convul&s;ed from a fright, and die in a few days; and a temporary madne&s;s frequently terminates the paroxy&s;ms of the epilep&s;ia dolorifica, and an in&s;anity of greater permanence is frequently induced by the pains or brui&s;es of partu|rition.</P>
<P>Where the patient is debilitated a quick pul&s;e &s;ometimes attends in&s;ane people, which is neverthele&s;s generally only a &s;ymptom of the debility, owing to the too great expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power; or of the paucity of its production, as in inirritative, or in &s;en&s;itive inirritated fever. See III. 1. 1.</P>
<P>But neverthele&s;s where the quick pul&s;e is permanent, it &s;hews the pre&s;ence of fever; and as the madne&s;s then generally ari&s;es from the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations attending the fever, it is &s;o far a good &s;ymp|tom; becau&s;e when the fever is cured, or cea&s;es &s;pontaneou&s;ly, the in&s;anity mo&s;t frequently vani&s;hes at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The &s;timulus of &s;o much volition &s;upports in&s;ane people under va|riety of hard&s;hips, and contributes to the cure of di&s;ea&s;es from debility, as &s;ometimes occurs towards the end of fevers. See Sect. XXXIV. 2. 5. And, on the &s;ame account, they bear large do&s;es of medicines to procure any operation on them; as emetics, and cathartics, which, before they produce their effect in inverting the motions of the &s;to|mach in vomiting, or of the ab&s;orbents of the bowels in purging, mu&s;t fir&s;t weaken the natural actions of tho&s;e organs, as &s;hewn in Sect. XXXV. 1. 13.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations it appears, that the indications of cure mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in removing the cau&s;e of the pain, whether it ari&s;es from a delirious idea, or from a real fact, or from bodily di&s;ea&s;e; or &s;econdly,
<PB N="352" REF="3620">
if this cannot be done, by relieving the pain in con&s;equence of &s;uch idea or di&s;ea&s;e. The fir&s;t is &s;ometimes effected by pre&s;enting frequently in a day contrary ideas to &s;hew the fallacy, or the too great e&s;timation, of the painful ideas. 2dly. By change of place, and thus pre&s;enting the &s;timulus of new objects, as a long journey. 3dly. By producing forgetfulne&s;s of the idea or object, which cau&s;es their pain; by removing all things which recal it to their minds; and avoiding all conver&s;ation on &s;imilar &s;ubjects. For I &s;uppo&s;e no di&s;ea&s;e of the mind is &s;o perfectly cured by other means as by forget|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly, the pain in con&s;equence of the ideas or bodily di&s;ea&s;es above de&s;cribed is to be removed, fir&s;t, by evacuations, as vene&s;ec|tion, emetics, and cathartics; and then by large do&s;es of opium, or by the vertigo occa&s;ioned by a circulating &s;wing, or by a &s;ea-voyage, which, as they affect the organs of &s;en&s;e as well as evacuate the &s;to|mach, may contribute to an&s;wer both indications of cure.</P>
<P>Where maniacs are outrageous, there can be no doubt but coercion is nece&s;&s;ary; which may be done by means of a &s;traight wai&s;tcoat; which di&s;arms them without hurting them; and by tying a handker|chief round their ankles to prevent their e&s;cape. In others there can be no doubt, but that confinement retards rather than promotes their cure; which is forwarded by change of ideas in con&s;equence of change of place and of objects, as by travelling or &s;ailing.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which render confinement nece&s;&s;ary, are fir&s;t, if the lunatic is liable to injure others, which mu&s;t be judged of by the outrage he has already committed. 2dly. If he is likely to injure him&s;elf; this al&s;o mu&s;t be judged of by the de&s;pondency of his mind, if &s;uch exi&s;ts. 3dly. If he cannot take care of his affairs. Where none of the&s;e circum&s;tances exi&s;t, there &s;hould be no confinement. For though the mi&s;taken idea continues to exi&s;t, yet if no actions are produced in con&s;equence of it, the patient cannot be called in&s;ane, he can only be termed delirious. If every one, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es mi&s;taken
<PB N="353" REF="3630">
ideas, or who puts fal&s;e e&s;timates on things, was liable to confine|ment, I know not who of my readers might not tremble at the &s;ight of a madhou&s;e!</P>
<P>The mo&s;t convenient di&s;tribution of in&s;anities will be into general, as mania mutabilis, &s;tudium inane, and vigilia; and into partial in|&s;anities. The&s;e la&s;t again may be &s;ubdivided into de&s;ires and aver|&s;ions, many of which are &s;ucceeded by plea&s;urable or painful ideas, by fury or dejection, according to the degree or violence of their ex|ertions. Hence the analogy between the in&s;anities of the mind, and the convul&s;ions of the mu&s;cles de&s;cribed in the preceding genus, is curiou&s;ly exact. The convul&s;ions without &s;tupor, are either ju&s;t &s;uf|ficient to obliterate the pain, which occa&s;ions them; or are &s;ucceeded by greater pain, as in the convul&s;io dolorifica. So the exertions in the mania mutabilis are either ju&s;t &s;ufficient to allay the pain which occa&s;ions them, and the patient dwells comparatively in a quiet &s;tate; or tho&s;e exertions excite painful ideas, which are &s;ucceeded by furious di&s;cour&s;es, or outrageous actions. The &s;tudium inane, or reverie, re&s;embles epilep&s;y, in which there is no &s;en&s;ibility to the &s;timuli of external objects. Vigilia, or watchfulne&s;s, may be compared to the general writhing of the body; which is ju&s;t a &s;ufficient exertion to relieve the pain which occa&s;ions it. Erotomania may be compared to tri&s;mus, or other mu&s;cular fixed &s;pa&s;m, without much &s;ub&s;equent pain; and maeror to cramp of the mu&s;cles of the leg, or other fixed &s;pa&s;m with &s;ub&s;equent pain. All the&s;e coincidences contribute to &s;hew, as explained in Sect. III. 5, that our ideas are motions of the immediate organs of &s;en&s;e obeying the &s;ame laws as our mu&s;cular motions.</P>
<P>The violence of action accompanying in&s;anity depends much on the education of the per&s;on; tho&s;e who have been proudly educated with unre&s;trained pa&s;&s;ions, are liable to greater fury; and tho&s;e, who&s;e education has been humble, to greater de&s;pondency. Where the delirious idea, above de&s;cribed, produces plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations, as
<PB N="354" REF="3640">
in per&s;onal vanity or religious enthu&s;ia&s;m; it is almo&s;t a pity to &s;natch them from their fool's paradi&s;e, and reduce them again to the com|mon lot of humanity; le&s;t they &s;hould complain of their cure, like the patient de&s;cribed in Horace,</P>
<LG>

</LG>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition to in&s;anity, as well as to convul&s;ion, is believed to be hereditary; and in con&s;equence to be induced in tho&s;e families from &s;lighter cau&s;es than in others. Convul&s;ions have been &s;hewn to have been mo&s;t frequently induced by pains owing to defect of &s;timu|lus, as the &s;huddering from cold, and not from pains from exce&s;s of &s;timulus, which are generally &s;ucceeded by inflammation. But in|&s;anities are on the contrary generally induced by pains from exce&s;s of &s;timulus, as from the too violent actions of our ideas, as in common anger, which is an in&s;anity of &s;hort duration; for in&s;anities generally, though not always, ari&s;e from pains of the organs of &s;en&s;e; but con|vul&s;ions generally, though not always, from pains of the membranes or glands. And it has been previou&s;ly explained, that though the membrane and glands, as the &s;tomach and &s;kin, receive great pain from want of &s;timulus; yet that the organs of &s;en&s;e, as the eye and ear, receive no pain from defect of &s;timulus.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that the con&s;titutions mo&s;t liable to convul&s;ion, are tho&s;e which mo&s;t readily become torpid in &s;ome part of the &s;y&s;|tem, that is, which po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s irritability; and that tho&s;e mo&s;t liable to in&s;anity, are &s;uch as have exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility; and la&s;tly, that the&s;e two circum&s;tances generally exi&s;t in the &s;ame con&s;titution; as explained in Sect. XXXI. 2. on Temperaments. The&s;e ob&s;ervations explain why epilep&s;y and in&s;anity frequently &s;ucceed or reciprocate with each other, and why inirritable habits, as &s;crophulous ones, are liable to in&s;anity, of which I have known &s;ome in&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="3650">
In many ca&s;es however there is no appearance of the di&s;po&s;ition to epilep&s;y or in&s;anity of the parent being tran&s;mitted to the progeny. Fir&s;t, where the in&s;anity has ari&s;en from &s;ome violent di&s;appoint|ment, and not from intemperance in the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors. Secondly, where the parent has acquired the in&s;anity or epilep&s;y by habits of intoxication after the procreation of his children. Which habits I &s;uppo&s;e to be the general cau&s;e of the di&s;po&s;ition to in&s;anity in this country. See Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. 7.</P>
<P>As the di&s;po&s;ition to gout, drop&s;y, epilep&s;y, and in&s;anity, appears to be produced by the intemperate u&s;e of &s;pirituous potation, and is in all of them hereditary; it &s;eems probable, that this di&s;po&s;ition gradu|ally increa&s;es from generation to generation, in tho&s;e families which continue for many generations to be intemperate in this re&s;pect; till at length the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are produced; that is, the irritability of the &s;y&s;tem gradually is decrea&s;ed by this powerful &s;timulus, and the &s;en|&s;ibility at the &s;ame time increa&s;ed, as explained in Sect. XXXI. 1. and 2. This di&s;po&s;ition is communicated to the progeny, and becomes &s;till increa&s;ed, if the &s;ame &s;timulus be continued, and &s;o on by a third and fourth generation; which accounts for the appearance of epilep&s;y in the children of &s;ome families, where it was never known before to have exi&s;ted, and could not be a&s;cribed to their own intem|perance. A parity of rea&s;oning &s;hews, that a few &s;ober generations may gradually in the &s;ame manner re&s;tore a due degree of irritability to the family, and decrea&s;e the exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>From hence it would appear probable, that &s;crophula and drop&s;y are di&s;ea&s;es from inirritability; but that in epilep&s;y and in&s;anity an ex|ce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility is added, and the two faulty temperaments are thus conjoined.</P>

I received good information of the truth of the following ca&s;e, which was publi&s;hed a few years ago in the new&s;papers. A young farmer in Warwick&s;hire, finding his hedges broke, and the &s;ticks carried away during a fro&s;ty &s;ea&s;on, determined to watch for the thief. He lay many cold hours under a hay-&s;tack, and at length an old woman, like a witch in a play, approached, and began to pull up the hedge; he waited till &s;he had tied up her bottle of &s;ticks, and was carrying them off, that he might convict her of the theft, and then &s;pringing from his concealment, he &s;eized his prey with violent threats. After &s;ome altercation, in which her load was left upon the ground, &s;he kneeled upon her bottle of &s;ticks, and rai&s;ing her arms to heaven beneath the bright moon then at the full, &s;poke to the farmer already &s;hivering with cold, "Heaven grant, that thou never maye&s;t know again the ble&s;&s;ing to be warm." He complained of cold all the next day, and wore an upper coat, and in a few days an|other, and in a fortnight took to his bed, always &s;aying nothing made him warm, he covered him&s;elf with very many blankets, and had a &s;ieve over his face, as he lay; and from this one in&s;ane idea he kept his bed above twenty years for fear of the cold air, till at length he died.</P>
<P>M. M. As mania ari&s;es from pain either of our mu&s;cles or organs of &s;en&s;e, the arts of relieving pain mu&s;t con&s;titute the method of cure. See Sect. XXXIV. 3. 4. Vene&s;ection. Vomits of from five grains to ten of emetic tartar, repeated every third morning for three or four times; with &s;olution of gum-ammoniac, and &s;oluble tartar, &s;o as to purge gently every day. Afterwards warm bath for two or three hours a day. Opium in large do&s;es. Bark. Steel.</P>
<P>Dr. Binns gave two &s;cruples (40 grains) of &s;olid opium at a do&s;e, and twenty grains four hours afterwards; which re&s;tored the patient.

<P>THE temporary quick pul&s;e attending &s;ome maniacal ca&s;es is &s;imply a &s;ymptom of debility, and is the con&s;equence of too great exertions; but a permanent quick pul&s;e &s;hews the pre&s;ence of fever, and is fre|quently a &s;alutary &s;ign; becau&s;e, if the life of the patient be &s;afe, when the fever cea&s;es, the in&s;anity generally vani&s;hes along with it, as mentioned above. In this ca&s;e the kind of fever mu&s;t direct the method of curing the in&s;anity; which mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of moderate eva|cuations and diluents, if the pul&s;e be &s;trong; or by nutrientia, bark, and &s;mall do&s;es of opium, if the pul&s;e be weak.</P>
<P>Where the cau&s;e is of a temporary nature, as in puerperal in&s;anity, there is rea&s;on to hope, that the di&s;ea&s;e will cea&s;e, when the brui&s;es, or other painful &s;en&s;ations attending this &s;tate, are removed. In the&s;e ca&s;es the child &s;hould be brought frequently to the mother, and ap|plied to her brea&s;t, if &s;he will &s;uffer it, and this whether &s;he at fir&s;t attends to it or not; as by a few trials it frequently excites the &s;torg&egrave;, or maternal affection, and removes the in&s;anity, as I have witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When the madne&s;s is occa&s;ioned by pain of the teeth, which I be|lieve is no uncommon ca&s;e, the&s;e mu&s;t be extracted; and the cure follows the extinction of the pain. There is however &s;ome difficulty in detecting the delinquent tooth in this ca&s;e, as in hemicrania, unle&s;s by its apparent decay, or by &s;ome previous information of its pain having been complained of; becau&s;e the pain of the tooth cea&s;es, as &s;oon as the exertions of in&s;anity commence.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on becomes in&s;ane, who has a family of &s;mall children to &s;olicit his attention, the progno&s;tic is very unfavourable; as it &s;hews the maniacal hallucination to be more powerful than tho&s;e ideas which generally intere&s;t us the mo&s;t.</P>

2. <HI>Studium inane.</HI> Reverie con&s;i&s;ts of violent voluntary exertions of ideas to relieve pain, with all the trains or tribes connected with them by &s;en&s;ations or a&s;&s;ociations. It frequently alternates with epi|leptic convul&s;ions; with which it corre&s;ponds, in re&s;pect to the in|&s;en&s;ibility of the mind to the &s;timuli of external objects, in the &s;ame manner as madne&s;s corre&s;ponds with common convul&s;ion, in the patient's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time a &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;timuli of external objects.</P>
<P>Some have been reported to have been involved in reverie &s;o per|fectly, as not to have been di&s;turbed by the di&s;charge of a cannon; and others to have been in&s;en&s;ible to torture, as the martyrs for reli|gious opinions; but the&s;e &s;eem more properly to belong to particular in&s;anities than to reverie, like no&s;talgia and erotomania.</P>
<P>Reverie is di&s;tingui&s;hed from madne&s;s as de&s;cribed above; and from delirium, becau&s;e the trains of ideas are kept con&s;i&s;tent by the power of volition, as the per&s;on rea&s;ons and deliberates in it. Somnambu|li&s;mus is a part of reverie, the latter con&s;i&s;ting in the exertions of the locomotive mu&s;cles, and the former of the exertions of the organs of &s;en&s;e; &s;ee Cla&s;s I. 1. 1. 9. and Sect. XIX. both which are mixed, or alternate with each other, for the purpo&s;e of relieving pain.</P>
<P>When the patients in reverie exert their volition on their organs of &s;en&s;e, they can occa&s;ionally perceive the &s;timuli of external objects, as explained in Sect. XIX. And in this ca&s;e it re&s;embles &s;ome|times an hallucination of the &s;en&s;es, as there is a mixture of fact and imagination in their di&s;cour&s;e; but may be thus di&s;tingui&s;hed: hallu|cinations of the &s;en&s;es are allied to delirium, and are attended gene|rally with quick pul&s;e, and other &s;ymptoms of great debility; but reverie is without fever, and generally alternates with convul&s;ions; and &s;o much intuitive analogy (&s;ee Sect. XVII. 3. 7.) is re|tained in its paroxy&s;ms, as to pre&s;erve a con&s;i&s;tency in the trains of ideas.</P>

In a few minutes he &s;aid, with apparent &s;urpri&s;e, "He is gone," and re|turned to his perfect mind. Other ca&s;es are related in Sect.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Vigilia.</HI> Watchfulne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the uncea&s;ing exertion of vo|lition; which is generally cau&s;ed by &s;ome degree of pain either of mind or of body, or from defect of the u&s;u$l quantity of plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation; hence if tho&s;e, who are accu&s;tomed to wine at night, take tea in&s;tead, they cannot &s;leep.

<P N="4">4. <HI>Erotomania.</HI> Sentimental love. De&s;cribed in its exce&s;s by ro|mance-writers and poets. As the object of love is beauty, and as our perception of beauty con&s;i&s;ts in a recognition by the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion of tho&s;e objects, which have before in&s;pired our love, by the plea&s;ure they have afforded to many of our &s;en&s;es (Sect. XVI. 6); and as brute animals have le&s;s accuracy of their &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion than mankind (ib.); we &s;ee the rea&s;on why this kind of love is not frequently ob&s;ervable in the brute creation, except perhaps in &s;ome married birds, or in the affection of the mother to her offspring. Men, who have not had lei&s;ure to cultivate their ta&s;te for vi&s;ible objects, and who have not read the works of poets and romance-writers, are le&s;s liable to &s;enti|mental love; and as ladies are educated rather with an idea of being cho&s;en, than of choo&s;ing; there are many men, and more women,
<PB N="364" REF="3740">
who have not much of this in&s;anity; and are therefore more ea&s;ily induced to marry for convenience or intere&s;t, or from the flattery of one &s;ex to the other.</P>
<P>In its fortunate gratification &s;entimental love is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;upply the pure&s;t &s;ource of human felicity; and from the &s;uddenne&s;s with which many of tho&s;e patients, de&s;cribed in Species I. of this genus, were &s;eized with the maniacal hallucination, there is rea&s;on to be|lieve, that the mo&s;t violent &s;entimental love may be acquired in a moment of time, as repre&s;ented by Shake&s;peare in the beginning of his Romeo and Juliet.</P>
<P>Some have endeavoured to make a di&s;tinction between beauty and grace, and have made them as it were rivals for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human heart; but grace may be defined beauty in action; for a &s;leep|ing beauty cannot be called graceful in whatever attitude &s;he may re|cline; the mu&s;cles mu&s;t be in action to produce a graceful attitude, and the limbs to produce a graceful motion. But though the object of love is beauty, yet the idea is neverthele&s;s much enhanced by the imagination of the lover; which appears from this curious circum|&s;tance, that the lady of his pa&s;&s;ion &s;eldom appears &s;o beautiful to the lover after a few months &s;eparation, as his ideas had painted her in his ab&s;ence; and there is, on that account, always a little di&s;appoint|ment felt for a minute at their next interview from this hallucination of his ideas.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;ion of love produces reverie in its fir&s;t &s;tate, which exer|tion alleviates the pain of it, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of hope converts it into plea&s;ure. Then the lover &s;eeks &s;olitude, le&s;t this agreeable re|verie &s;hould be interrupted by external &s;timuli, as de&s;cribed by Virgil.</P>

When the pain of love is &s;o great, as not to be relieved by the ex|ertions of reverie, as above de&s;cribed; as when it is mi&s;placed on an object, of which the lover cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf; it may &s;till be counteracted or conquered by the &s;toic philo&s;ophy, which &s;trips all things of their ornaments, and inculcates "nil admirari." Of which le&s;&s;ons may be found in the meditations of Marcus Antoninus. The maniacal idea is &s;aid in &s;ome lovers to have been weakened by the action of other very energetic ideas; &s;uch as have been occa&s;ioned by the death of his favourite child, or by the burning of his hou&s;e, or by his being &s;hipwrecked. In tho&s;e ca&s;es the violence of the new idea for a while expends &s;o much &s;en&s;orial power as to prevent the exer|tion of the maniacal one; and new catenations &s;ucceed. On this theory the lover's leap, &s;o celebrated by poets, might effect a cure, if the patient e&s;caped with life.</P>
<P>The third &s;tage of this di&s;ea&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e is irremediable; when a lover has previou&s;ly been much encouraged, and at length meets with neglect or di&s;dain; the maniacal idea is &s;o painful as not to be for a moment relievable by the exertions of reverie, but is in&s;tantly follow|ed by furious or melancholy in&s;anity; and &s;uicide, or revenge, have frequently been the con&s;equence.

I once &s;aw a hand&s;ome young man, who had been &s;o much flattered by his parents, that his vanity ro&s;e &s;o near to in&s;anity, that one might di&s;cern by his perpetual attention to him&s;elf, and the dif|ficulty with which he arranged his conver&s;ation, that the idea of him|&s;elf intruded it&s;elf at every comma or pau&s;e of his di&s;cour&s;e. In this degree vanity mu&s;t afford great plea&s;ure to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and when it exi&s;ts within moderate bounds, may contribute much to the hap|pine&s;s of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>My friend Mr.&mdash;once complained to me, that he was much troubled with ba&s;hfulne&s;s in company, and believed that it aro&s;e from his want of per&s;onal vanity; on this account he determined on a jour|ney to Paris, when Paris was the center of politene&s;s; he there learnt to dre&s;s, to dance, and to move his hands gracefully in con|ver&s;ation; and returned a mo&s;t con&s;ummate coxcomb. But after a very few years he relap&s;ed into ru&s;ticity of dre&s;s and manners.</P>

While in our part of the globe fa&s;ting and mortifica|tion, as flagellation, has been believed to plea&s;e a merciful deity! The &s;erenity, with which many have &s;uffered cruel martyrdoms, is to be a&s;cribed to this powerful reverie.</P>
<P>Mr.&mdash;, a clergyman, formerly of this neighbourhood, began to brui&s;e and wound him&s;elf for the &s;ake of religious mortification, and pa&s;&s;ed much time in prayer, and continued whole nights alone in the church. As he had a wife and family of &s;mall children, I be|lieved the ca&s;e to be incurable; as otherwi&s;e the affection and employ|ment in his family connections would have oppo&s;ed the beginning of this in&s;anity. He was taken to a madhou&s;e without effect, and after
<PB N="368" REF="3780">
he returned home, continued to beat and brui&s;e him&s;elf, and by this kind of mortification, and by &s;ometimes long fa&s;ting, he at length became emaciated and died. I once told him in conver&s;ation, that "God was a merciful being, and could not delight in cruelty, but that I &s;uppo&s;ed he wor&s;hipped the devil." He was &s;truck with this idea, and promi&s;ed me not to beat him&s;elf for three days, and I be|lieve kept his word for one day. If this idea had been frequently forced on his mind, it might probably have been of &s;ervice.</P>

<P N="10">10. <HI>Maeror.</HI> Grief. A perpetual voluntary contemplation of all the circum&s;tances of &s;ome great lo&s;s, as of a favourite child. In ge|neral the painful ideas gradually decrea&s;e in energy, and at length the recollection becomes more tender and le&s;s painful. The letter of Sul|picius to Cicero on the lo&s;s of his daughter is ingenious. The ex|ample of David on the lo&s;s of his child is heroic.</P>
<P>A widow lady was left in narrow circum&s;tances with a boy and a girl, two beautiful and lively children, the one &s;ix and the other &s;even years of age; as her circum&s;tances allowed her to keep but one

maid-&s;ervant, the&s;e two children were the &s;ole attention, employ|ment, and con&s;olation of her life; &s;he fed them, dre&s;&s;ed them, &s;lept with them, and taught them her&s;elf; they were both &s;natched from her by the gangrenous &s;ore throat in one week: &s;o that &s;he lo&s;t at once all that employed her, as well as all that was dear to her. For the fir&s;t three or four days after their death, when any friend vi&s;ited her, &s;he &s;at upright, with her eyes wide open, without &s;hedding tears, and affected to &s;peak of indifferent things. Afterwards &s;he be|gan to weep much, and for &s;ome weeks talked to her friends of no|thing el&s;e but her dear children. But did not for many years, even to her dying hour, get quite over a gloom, which was left upon her countenance.</P>
<P>In violent grief, when tears flow, it is e&s;teemed a good &s;ymptom; becau&s;e then the actions cau&s;ed by &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation take the place of tho&s;e cau&s;ed by volition; that is, they prevent the voluntary exer|tions of ideas, or mu&s;cular actions, which con&s;titute in&s;anity.</P>
<P>The &s;obbing and &s;ighing attendant upon grief are not convul&s;ive movements, they are occa&s;ioned by the &s;en&s;orial power being &s;o ex|pended on the painful ideas, and their connections, that the per&s;on neglects to breathe for a time, and then a violent &s;igh or &s;ob is nece&s;|&s;ary to carry on the blood, which oppre&s;&s;es the pulmonary ve&s;&s;els, which is then performed by deep or quick in&s;pirations, and laborious expirations. Sometimes neverthele&s;s the breath is probably for a while voluntarily held, as an effort to relieve pain. The palene&s;s and ill health occa&s;ioned by long grief is &s;poken of in Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 9.</P>
<P>The melioration of grief by time, and its being at length even attended with plea&s;ure, depends on our retaining a di&s;tinct idea of the lo&s;t object, and forgetting for a time the idea of the lo&s;s of it. This plea&s;ure of grief is beautifully de&s;cribed by Aken&s;ide. Plea&s;ures of Imagination, Book II. l. 680.</P>

<P>M. M. Con&s;olation is be&s;t &s;upplied by the Chri&s;tian doctrine of a happy immortality. In the pagan religion the power of dying was the great con&s;olation in irremediable di&s;tre&s;s. Seneca &s;ays, "no one need be unhappy unle&s;s by his own fault." And the author of Tele|machus begins his work by &s;aying, that Calyp&s;o could not con&s;ole her&s;elf for the lo&s;s of Uly&s;&s;es, and found her&s;elf unhappy in being im|mortal.

<P>Mr.&mdash;, a gentleman about fifty, of poli&s;hed manners, who in a few months afterwards de&s;troyed him&s;elf, &s;aid to me one day, "a ride out in the morning, and a warm parlour and a pack of cards in the afternoon, is all that life affords." He was per&s;uaded to have an i&s;&s;ue on the top of his head, as he complained of a dull head-ach, which being un&s;kilfully managed, de&s;troyed the pericranium to the &s;ize of an inch in diameter; during the time this took in healing, he was indignant about it, and endured life, but &s;oon afterwards &s;hot him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr.&mdash;, a gentleman of Gray's Inn, &s;ome years ago was pre|vailed upon by his friends to di&s;mi&s;s a mi&s;tre&s;s, by whom he had a child, but who was &s;o great a termagant and &s;cold, that &s;he was be|lieved to u&s;e him very ill, and even to beat him.

<P>Mr. An&s;on, the brother to the late Lord An&s;on, related to me the following anecdote of the death of Lord Sc&mdash;. His Lord&s;hip &s;ent to &s;ee Mr. An&s;on on the Monday preceding his death, and &s;aid, "You are the only friend I value in the world, I determined there|fore to acquaint you, that I am tired of the in&s;ipidity of life, and in|tend to-morrow to leave it." Mr. An&s;on &s;aid, after much conver&s;a|tion, that he was obliged to leave town till Friday, and added, "As you profe&s;s a friend&s;hip for me, do me this la&s;t favour, I entreat you, live till I return." Lord Sc&mdash;believed this to be a pious artifice to gain time, but neverthele&s;s agreed, if he &s;hould return by four o'clock on that day. Mr. An&s;on did not return till five, and found,
<PB N="374" REF="3840">
by the countenances of the dome&s;tics, that the deed was done. He went into his chamber and found the corp&s;e of his friend leaning over the arm of a great chair, with the pi&s;tol on the ground by him, the ball of which had been di&s;charged into the roof of his mouth, and pa&s;&s;ed into his brain.</P>
<P>Mr.&mdash;and Mr.&mdash;, two young men, heirs to con&s;iderable fortunes, &s;hot them&s;elves at the age of four or five and twenty, with|out their friends being able to conjecture any cau&s;e for tho&s;e ra&s;h ac|tions. One of them I had long known to expre&s;s him&s;elf with di&s;|&s;atisfaction of the world; at eighteen years of age he complained, that he could not entertain him&s;elf; he tried to &s;tudy the law at Cam|bridge, and afterwards went abroad for a year or two by my advice; but returned di&s;&s;atisfied with all things. As he had had an eruption for &s;ome years on a part of his face, which he probably endeavoured to remove by external applications; I was induced to a&s;cribe his per|petual ennui to the pain or di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation of a di&s;ea&s;ed liver. The other young gentleman &s;hot him&s;elf in his bed-room, and I was informed that there was found written on a &s;crap of paper on his table, "I am impotent, and therefore not fit to live." From whence there was rea&s;on to conclude, that this was the hallucinatio maniacalis, the delirious idea, which cau&s;ed him to de&s;troy him|&s;elf. The ca&s;e therefore belongs to mania mutabilis, and not to tae|dium vitae.</P>
<P>M. M. Some re&s;traint in exhau&s;ting the u&s;ual plea&s;ures of the world early in life. The agreeable cares of a matrimonial life.

<P>In many of the&s;e ca&s;es, whence irk&s;omene&s;s of life has been the often&s;ible cau&s;e of &s;uicide, there has probably exi&s;ted a maniacal hal|lucination, a painful idea, which the patient has concealed even to his dying hour; except where the mania has evidently ari&s;en from hereditary

<P N="12">12. <HI>Pulchitudinis de&s;iderium.</HI> The lo&s;s of beauty, either by di&s;ea&s;e, as by the &s;mall-pox, or by age, as life advances, is &s;ometimes pain|fully felt by ladies, who have been much flattered on account of it. There is a curious ca&s;e of this kind related in Le Sage's Bachelor of Salamanca, which is too nicely de&s;cribed to be totally imaginary.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation &s;ome ladies apply to what are termed co&s;metics under various names, which crowd the new&s;papers. Of the&s;e the white has de&s;troyed the health of thou&s;ands; a calx, or magi&s;tery, of bi&s;muth is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;old in the &s;hops for this purpo&s;e; but it is either, I am informed, in part or entirely white lead or ceru&s;&s;a. The pernicious effects of the external u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;aturnine applications are &s;poken of in gutta ro&s;ea, Cla&s;s II. 1. 4. 6. The real calx of bi&s;muth would probably have the &s;ame ill effect. As the red paint is prepared from cochineal, which is an animal body, le&s;s if any injury ari&s;es from its u&s;e, as it only lies on the &s;kin like other filth.</P>
<P>The tan of the &s;kin occa&s;ioned by the &s;un may be removed by lemon juice evaporated by the fire to half its original quantity, or by diluted marine acid; which cleans the cuticle, by eroding its &s;urface, but requires much caution in the application; the marine acid mu&s;t be diluted with water, and when put upon the hand or face, after a &s;econd of time, as &s;oon as the tan di&s;appears, the part mu&s;t be wa&s;hed with a wet towel and much warm water. Freckles lie too deep for this operation, nor are they in general removeable by a bli&s;ter, as I once experienced. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 9.</P>
<P>It is probable, that tho&s;e materials which &s;tain &s;ilk, or ivory, might be u&s;ed to &s;tain the cuticle, or hair, permanently; as they are all animal &s;ub&s;tances. But I do not know, that any trials of this kind have been made on the &s;kin. I endeavoured in vain to whiten the
<PB N="376" REF="3860">
back of my hand by marine acid oxygenated by mangane&s;e, which &s;o in&s;tantly whitens cotton.</P>
<P>The cure therefore mu&s;t be &s;ought from moral writers, and the cultivation of the graces of the mind, which are frequently a more valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion than celebrated beauty.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Paupertatis timor.</HI> The fear of poverty is one kind of avarice; it is liable to affect people who have left off a profitable and active bu&s;ine&s;s; as they are thus deprived of their u&s;ual exertions, and are liable to ob&s;erve the daily expenditure of money, without calculating the &s;ource from whence it flows. It is al&s;o liable to occur with a &s;udden and unexpected increa&s;e of fortune. Mr.&mdash;, a &s;urgeon, about fifty years of age, who was always rather of a par&s;imonious di&s;po&s;ition, had a large hou&s;e, with a fortune of forty thou&s;and pounds, left him by a di&s;tant relation; and in a few weeks became in&s;ane from the fear of poverty, lamenting that he &s;hould die in a jail or workhou&s;e. He had left off a laborious country bu&s;ine&s;s, and the daily perception of profit in his books; he al&s;o now &s;aw greater expences going forwards in his new hou&s;e, than he had been ac|cu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve, and did not &s;o di&s;tinctly &s;ee the &s;ource of &s;upply; which &s;eems to have occa&s;ioned the maniacal hallucination.&mdash;This idea of approaching poverty is a very frequent and very painful di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o as to have induced many to become &s;uicides, who were in good circum&s;tances; more perhaps than any other maniacal hallucination, except the fear of hell.</P>
<P>The covetou&s;ne&s;s of age is more liable to affect &s;ingle men, than tho&s;e who have families; though an accumulation of wealth would &s;eem to be more de&s;irable to the latter. But an old man in the former &s;ituation, has no per&s;onal connections to induce him to open his pur&s;e; and having lo&s;t the friends of his youth, and not ea&s;ily acquiring new ones, feels him&s;elf alone in the world; feels him&s;elf unprotected, as his &s;trength declines, and is thus led to depend for
<PB N="377" REF="3870">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance on money, and on that account wi&s;hes to accumulate it. Whereas the father of a family has not only tho&s;e connections, which demand the frequent expenditure of money, but feels a con&s;olation in the friend&s;hip of his children, when age may render their good offices nece&s;&s;ary to him.</P>
<P>M. M. I have been well informed of a medical per&s;on in good cir|circum&s;tances in London, who always carries an account of his af|fairs, as debtor and creditor, in his pocket-book; and looks over it frequently in a day, when this di&s;ea&s;e returns upon him; and thus, by counteracting the maniacal hallucination, wi&s;ely prevents the in|crea&s;e of his in&s;anity. Another medical per&s;on, in London, is &s;aid to have cured him&s;elf of this di&s;ea&s;e by &s;tudying mathematics with great attention; which exertions of the mind relieved the pain of the maniacal hallucination.</P>
<P>Many moral writers have &s;tigmati&s;ed this in&s;anity; the covetous, they &s;ay, commit crimes and mortify them&s;elves without hopes of re|ward; and thus become mi&s;erable both in this world and the next. Thus Juvenal:</P>

<P>The &s;ufferers under this malady are generally at once di&s;coverable by their telling you, amid&s;t an unconnected de&s;cription of their com|plaints, that they are neverthele&s;s not afraid of dying.

<P>M. M.

Some of the&s;e, which I think curious, I &s;hall con|ci&s;ely relate, as a part of the method of cure.</P>
<P>Mr.&mdash;, an elderly gentleman, had &s;ent for me one whole day before I could attend him; on my arrival he &s;aid he was glad to &s;ee me, but that he was now quite well, except that he was weak, but had had a pain in his bowels the day before. He then lay in bed with his legs cold up to the knees, his hands and arms cold, and his pul&s;e &s;carcely di&s;cernible, and died in about &s;ix hours. Mr.&mdash;, another gentleman about &s;ixty, lay in the act of dying, with difficult re&s;piration like groaning, but in a kind of &s;tupor or coma vigil, and every ten or twelve minutes, while I &s;at by him, he waked, looked up, and &s;aid, "who is it groans &s;o, I am &s;ure there is &s;omebody dying in the room," and then &s;unk again into a kind of &s;leep. From the&s;e two ca&s;es there appeared to be no pain in the act of dying, which may afford con&s;olation to all, but particularly to tho&s;e who are afflict|ed with the fear of death.</P>

15. <HI>Orci timor.</HI> The fear of hell. Many theatric preachers among the Methodi&s;ts &s;ucce&s;sfully in&s;pire this terror, and live comfortably upon the folly of their hearers. In this kind of madne&s;s the poor patients frequently commit &s;uicide; although they believe they run headlong into the hell, which they dread! Such is the power of ora|tory, and &s;uch the debility of the human under&s;tanding!</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who &s;uffer under this in&s;anity, are generally the mo&s;t in|nocent and harmle&s;s people; who are then liable to accu&s;e them&s;elves of the greate&s;t imaginary crimes, and have &s;o much intellectual cowardice, that they dare not rea&s;on about tho&s;e things, which they are directed by their prie&s;ts to believe, however contradictory to hu|man apprehen&s;ion, or derogatory to the great Creator of all things.

<P>An injury voluntarily inflicted on us by others excites our exertions of &s;elf-defence or of revenge again&s;t the perpetrator of it; but anger does not &s;ucceed in any great degree unle&s;s our pride is offended; this idea is the maniacal hallucination, the pain of which &s;ometimes pro|duces &s;uch violent and general exertions of our mu&s;cles and ideas, as to di&s;appoint the revenge we meditate, and vainly to exhau&s;t our &s;en|&s;orial power.

<P>A poet of antiquity, who&s;e name I do not recollect, is &s;aid to have written a book de&s;cribing the mi&s;eries of the world, and to have de|&s;troyed him&s;elf at the conclu&s;ion of his ta&s;k. This &s;ympathy, with all &s;en&s;itive beings, has been carried &s;o far by &s;ome individuals, and even by whole tribes, as the Gentoos, as not only to re&s;train them from killing animals for their &s;upport, but even to induce them to permit in&s;ects to prey upon their bodies. Such is however the con|dition of mortality, that the fir&s;t law of nature is, "Eat or be eaten."

<P>The old man of the mountain in Syria, who governed a &s;mall na|tion of people called A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ines, is recorded thus to have educated tho&s;e of his army who were de&s;igned to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the princes with whom he was at war. A young man of natural activity was cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e, and thrown into a deep &s;leep by opium mixed with his food; he was then carried into a garden made to repre&s;ent the paradi&s;e of Mahomet, with flowers of great beauty and fragrance, fruits of deli|cious flavor, and beautiful houries beckoning him into the &s;hades. After a while, on being a &s;econd time &s;tupified with opium, the young enthu&s;ia&s;t was reconveyed to his apartment; and on the next day was a&s;&s;ured by a prie&s;t, that he was de&s;igned for &s;ome great ex|ploit, and that by obeying the commands of their prince, immortal happine&s;s awaited him.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">With decrea&s;ed Actions of the Mu&s;cles.</HEAD>
<P>OUR mu&s;cles become fatigued by long contraction, and cea&s;e for a time to be excitable by the will; owing to exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power, which re&s;ides in them. After a &s;hort interval of relaxation the mu&s;cle regains its power of voluntary contraction; which is pro|bably occa&s;ioned by a new &s;upply of the &s;pirit of animation. In weaker people the&s;e contractions cea&s;e &s;ooner, and therefore recur more frequently, and are attended with &s;horter intervals of relaxation, as exemplified in the quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e in fevers with debility, and in the tremors of the hands of aged or feeble people.</P>
<P>After a common degree of exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power in a mu&s;cle, it becomes again gradually re&s;tored by the re&s;t of the mu&s;cle; and even accumulated in tho&s;e mu&s;cles, which are mo&s;t frequently u&s;ed; as in tho&s;e which con&s;titute the capillaries of the &s;kin after having been rendered torpid by cold. But in tho&s;e mu&s;cles, which are generally obedient to volition, as tho&s;e of locomotion, though their u&s;ual quantity of &s;en&s;orial power is re&s;tored by their quie&s;cence, or in &s;leep (for &s;leep affects the&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem only), yet but little accumulation of it &s;ucceeds. And this want of accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power in the&s;e mu&s;cles, which are chiefly &s;ub&s;ervient to volition, explains to us one cau&s;e of their greater tendency to paralytic affection.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="3980">
It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, which have been for a time quie&s;cent from want of &s;timulus, as the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, when expo&s;ed to cold, acquire an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during their inactivity; but this does not happen at all, or in much le&s;s quantity, from their quie&s;cence after great expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power by a previous exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus, as after intoxication. In this ca&s;e the mu&s;cles or organs of &s;en&s;e gradually acquire their na|tural quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, as after &s;leep; but not an accumu|lation or &s;uperabundance of it. And by frequent repetitions of ex|hau&s;tion by great &s;timulus, the&s;e ve&s;&s;els cea&s;e to acquire their whole natural quantity of &s;en&s;orial power; as in the &s;chirrous &s;tomach, and &s;chirrous liver, occa&s;ioned by the great and frequent &s;timulus of vinous &s;pirit; which may properly be termed irritative paraly&s;is of tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner in common pal&s;ies the inaction of the paralytic mu&s;cle &s;eems not to be owing to defect of the &s;timulus of the will, but to exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power. Whence it frequently follows great exertion, as in Sect. XXXIV. 1. 7. Thus &s;ome parts of the &s;y&s;tem may cea&s;e to obey the will, as in common para$y&s;is; others may cea&s;e to be obedient to &s;en&s;ation, as in the impotency of age; others to irritation, as in &s;chirrous vi&s;cera; and others to a&s;&s;ociation, as in impediment of &s;peech; yet though all the&s;e may become inex|citable, or dead, in re&s;pect to that kind of &s;timulus, which has pre|viou&s;ly exhau&s;ted them, whether of volition, or &s;en&s;ation, or ir|ritation, or a&s;&s;ociation, they may &s;till in many ca&s;es be excited by the others.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>La&s;&s;itudo.</HI> Fatigue or wearine&s;s after much voluntary exertion. From the too great expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power the mu&s;cles are with difficulty brought again into voluntary contraction; and &s;eem to require a greater quantity or energy of volition for this purpo&s;e. At the &s;ame time they &s;till remain obedient to the &s;timulus of agree|able &s;en&s;ation, as appears in tired dancers finding a renovation of their aptitude to motion on the acqui&s;ition of an agreeable partner; or from a tired child riding on a gold-headed cane, as in Sect. XXXIV. 2. 6. The&s;e mu&s;cles are likewi&s;e &s;till obedient to the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, becau&s;e the motions, when thus excited, are performed in their de&s;igned directions, and are not broken into variety of ge&s;ti|culation, as in St. Vitus's dance.</P>
<P>A la&s;&s;itude likewi&s;e frequently occurs with yawning at the begin|ning of ague-fits; where the production of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain is le&s;s than its expenditure.

By the&s;e motions the mu&s;cles, which pre&s;erve the perpendicularity of the body, are alternately quie&s;cent, and ex|erted; and are thus le&s;s liable to fatigue or exhau&s;tion. This there|fore re&s;embles the tremors of old people above mentioned, and not tho&s;e &s;pa&s;modic movements of the face or limbs, which are called tricks, de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s IV. 3. 2. 2. which originate from exce&s;s of

The&s;e tremors only exi&s;t when the affected mu&s;cles are excited into action, as in lifting a gla&s;s to the mouth, or in writing, or in keep|ing the body upright; and cea&s;e again, when no voluntary exertion is attempted, as in lying down. Hence the&s;e tremors evidently ori|ginate from the too quick exhau&s;tion of the le&s;&s;ened quantity of the &s;pirit of animation. So many people tremble from fear or anger, when too great a part of the &s;en&s;orial power is exerted on the organs of &s;en&s;e, &s;o as to deprive the mu&s;cles, which &s;upport the body erect, of their due quantity.</P>

In the colica &s;aturnina a paraly&s;is affects the wri&s;ts, as appears on the patient extending his arm horizontally with the palm downwards, and is often attended with a tumor on the carpal or metacarpal bones.

<P>Mr. M&mdash;, a miner and well-&s;inker, about three years ago, lo&s;t the power of contracting both his thumbs; the balls or mu&s;cles of the thumbs are much emaciated, and remain paralytic.

He &s;ays his hands had frequently been much be|numbed before, &s;o that he could not without difficulty clench them;

<P>In this ca&s;e there exi&s;ted two injurious circum&s;tances of different kinds; one the violent and continued action of the mu&s;cles, which de&s;troys by exhau&s;ting the &s;en&s;orial power; and the other, the appli|cation of cold, which de&s;troys by defect of &s;timulus. The cold &s;eems to have contributed to the paraly&s;is by its long application, as well as the continued exertion; but as during the torpo$ occa&s;ioned by the expo&s;ure to cold, if the degree of it be not &s;o great as to extingui&s;h life, the &s;en&s;orial power becomes accumulated; there is rea&s;on to be|lieve, that the expo&s;ing a paralytic limb to the cold for a certain time, as by covering it with &s;now or iced water for a few minutes, and then covering it with warm flannel, and this frequently repeated, might, by accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, contribute to re&s;tore it to a &s;tate of voluntary excitability. As this accumulation of &s;en|&s;orial power, and con&s;equent glow, &s;eems, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;everal times to have contributed to re&s;tore the numbne&s;s or inability of tho&s;e mu&s;cles, which at length became paralytic.

This ob&s;ervation is of great value to tho&s;e, who attend to the education of their own children. I have &s;een one or two young married ladies of fortune, who perpetually became unea&s;y, and be|lieved them&s;elves ill, a week after their arrival in the country, and continued &s;o uniformly during their &s;tay; yet on their return to Lon|don or Bath immediately lo&s;t all their complaints, and this repeatedly; which I was led to a&s;cribe to their being in their infancy &s;urrounded with menial attendants, who had flattered them into the exertions they then u&s;ed. And that in their riper years, they became torpid for want of this &s;timulus, and could not amu&s;e them&s;elves by any vo|luntary employment; but required ever after, either to be amu&s;ed by other people, or to be flattered into activity.

As the voluntary motions are not perpetually exerted, there is little &s;en&s;orial power ac|cumulated during their quie&s;cence, whence they are le&s;s liable to re|cover from torpor, and are thus more frequently left paralytic, or di&s;obedient to the power of volition, though they are &s;ometimes &s;till alive to painful &s;en&s;ation, as to the prick of a pin, and to heat; al&s;o to irritation, as in &s;tretching and yawning; or to electric &s;hocks. Where the paraly&s;is is complete the patient &s;eems gradually to learn to u&s;e his limbs over again by repeated efforts, as in infancy; and, as time is required for this purpo&s;e, it becomes difficult to know, whether the cure is owing to the effect of medicines, or to the re|peated efforts of the voluntary power.</P>

Black &s;tools &s;ometimes attend the commencement of hemiplegia, which is probably an effu&s;ion of blood from the biliary duct, where the liver is previou&s;ly affected; or &s;ome blood may be derived to the inte&s;tines by its e&s;caping from the vena cava into the receptacle of chyle during the di&s;tre&s;s of the paralytic attack; and may be conveyed from thence into the inte&s;tines by the retrograde motions of the lacteals; as pro|bably &s;ometimes happens in diabaetes. See Sect. XXVII. 2. Pal&s;y of one &s;ide of the face is mentioned in Cla&s;s II. 1. 4. 6. Paraly&s;is of the lacteals, of the liver, and of the veins, which are de&s;cribed in Sect. XXVIII.

<P N="11">11. <HI>Paraplegia.</HI> A pal&s;y of the lower half of the body divided ho|rizontally. Animals may be conceived to have double bodies, one half in general re&s;embling &s;o exactly the other, and being &s;upplied with &s;eparate &s;ets of nerves; this gives ri&s;e to hemiplegia, or pal&s;y of one half of the body divided vertically; but the paraplegia, or pal&s;y of the lower parts of the &s;y&s;tem, depends on an injury of the &s;pinal marrow, or that part of the brain which is contained in the vertebrae of the back; by which all the nerves &s;ituated below the injured part are deprived of their nutriment, or precluded from doing their proper offices; and the mu&s;cles, to which they are derived, are in con&s;e|quence di&s;obedient to the power of volition.</P>
<P>This &s;ometimes occurs from an external injury, as a fall from an eminence; of which I &s;aw a deplorable in&s;tance, where the bladder and rectum, as well as the lower limbs, were deprived of &s;o much of their powers of motion, as depended on volition or &s;en&s;ation; but I &s;uppo&s;e not of that part of it, which depends on irritation. In the &s;ame manner as the voluntary mu&s;cles in hemiplegia are &s;ometimes brought into action by irritation, as in &s;tretching or pendiculation, de&s;cribed in Sect. VII. 1. 3.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of paraplegia is from a protuberance of one of the &s;pinal vertebrae; which is owing to the innutrition or &s;oft|ne&s;s of bones, de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 17.

<P>The &s;ub&s;equent ingenious ob&s;ervations on the frequency of the pul&s;e, which &s;ometimes occurs in &s;leep, are copied from a letter of Dr. Currie of Liverpool to the author.</P>
<P>"Though re&s;t in general perhaps renders the healthy pul&s;e &s;lower, yet under certain circum&s;tances the contrary is the truth. A full meal without wine or other &s;trong liquor does not increa&s;e the fre|quency of my pul&s;e, while I &s;it upright, and have my attention en|gaged. But if I take a recumbent po&s;ture after eating, my pul&s;e becomes more frequent, e&s;pecially if my mind be vacant, and I be|come drow&s;y; and, if I &s;lumber, this increa&s;ed frequency is more con&s;iderable with heat and flu&s;hing.</P>
<P>"This I apprehend to be a general truth. The ob&s;ervation may be frequently made upon children; and the re&s;tle&s;s and feveri&s;h nights experienced by many people after a full &s;upper are, I believe, owing to this cau&s;e. The &s;upper occa&s;ions no inconvenience, whil&s;t the per&s;on is upright and awake; but, when he lies down and begins to &s;leep, e&s;pecially if he does not per&s;pire, the &s;ymptoms above men|tioned occur. Which may be thus explained in part from your prin|ciples. When the power of volition is aboli&s;hed, the other &s;en&s;orial actions are increa&s;ed. In ordinary &s;leep this does not occa&s;ion in|crea&s;ed frequency of the pul&s;e; but where &s;leep takes place during the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion, the dige&s;tion it&s;elf goes on with increa&s;ed rapidity.
<PB N="398" REF="4080">
Heat is excited in the &s;y&s;tem fa&s;ter than it is expended; and operating on the &s;en&s;itive actions, it carries them beyond the limita|tion of plea&s;ure, producing, as is common in &s;uch ca&s;es, increa&s;ed frequency of pul&s;e.</P>
<P>"It is to be ob&s;erved, that in &s;peaking of the heat generated under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I do not allude to any chemical evolution of heat from the food in the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion. I doubt if this takes place to any con&s;iderable degree, for I do not ob&s;erve that the parts incum|bent on the &s;tomach are increa&s;ed in heat during the mo&s;t hurried di|ge&s;tion. It is on &s;ome parts of the &s;urface, but more particularly on the extremities of the body, that the increa&s;ed heat excited by dige&s;|tion appears, and the heat thus produced ari&s;es, as it &s;hould &s;eem, from the &s;ympathy between the &s;tomach and the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin. The parts mo&s;t affected are the palms of the hands and the &s;oles of the feet. Even there the thermometer &s;eldom ri&s;es above 97 or 98 degrees, a temperature not higher than that of the trunk of the body; but three or four degrees higher than the common temperature of the&s;e parts, and therefore producing an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation of heat, a &s;en&s;ation increa&s;ed by the great &s;en&s;ibility of the parts affected.</P>
<P>"That the increa&s;ed heat excited by dige&s;tion in &s;leep is the cau&s;e of the accompanying fever, &s;eems to be confirmed by ob&s;erving, that if an increa&s;ed expenditure of heat accompanies the increa&s;ed genera|tion of it (as when per&s;piration on the extremities or &s;urface attends this kind of &s;leep) the frequent pul&s;e and flu&s;hed countenance do not occur, as I know by experiment. If, during the feveri&s;h &s;leep al|ready mentioned, I am awakened, and my attention engaged power|fully, my pul&s;e becomes almo&s;t immediately &s;lower, and the fever gradually &s;ub&s;ides."</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations of Dr. Currie it appears, that, while in common &s;leep the actions of the heart, arteries, and capillaries, are &s;trengthened by the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during the &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of voluntary action, and the pul&s;e in con&s;equence becomes
<PB N="399" REF="4090">
fuller and &s;lower; in the feveri&s;h &s;leep above de&s;cribed the actions of the heart, arteries, and capillaries, are quickened as well as &s;trength|ened by their con&s;ent with the increa&s;ed actions of the &s;tomach, as well as by the &s;timulus of the new chyle introduced into the circula|tion. For the &s;tomach, and all other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, being more &s;en&s;ible and more irritable during &s;leep, Sect. XVIII. 15. and probably more ready to act from a&s;&s;ociation, are now exerted with greater velocity as well as &s;trength, con&s;tituting a temporary fever of the &s;en&s;itive irritated kind, re&s;embling the fever excited by wine in the beginning of intoxication; or in &s;ome people by a full meal in their waking hours. Sect. XXXV. 1.</P>
<P>On waking, this increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility and irritability of the &s;y&s;tem cea&s;es by the renewed exertions of volition; in the &s;ame manner as more violent exertions of volition de&s;troy greater pains; and the pul&s;e in con&s;equence &s;ub&s;ides along with the increa&s;e of heat; if more vio|lent efforts of volition are exerted, the &s;y&s;tem becomes &s;till le&s;s af|fected by &s;en&s;ation or irritation. Hence the fever and vertigo of intoxi|cation are le&s;&s;ened by inten&s;e thinking, Sect. XXI. 8; and in&s;ane people are known to bear the pain of cold and hunger better than others, Sect. XXXIV. 2. 5; and la&s;tly, if greater voluntary efforts exi&s;t, as in violent anger or violent exerci&s;e, the whole &s;y&s;tem is thrown into more energetic action, and a voluntary fever is induced, as appears by the red &s;kin, quickened pul&s;e, and increa&s;e of heat; whence drop&s;ies and fevers with debility are not unfrequently removed by in&s;anity.</P>
<P>Hence the exertion of the voluntary power in its natural degree dimini&s;hes the increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility, and irritability, and probably the increa&s;ed a&s;&s;ociability, which occurs during &s;leep; and thus reduces the frequency of the pul&s;e in the feveri&s;h &s;leep after a full meal. In its more powerful &s;tate of exertion, it dimini&s;hes or de&s;troys &s;en&s;a|tions and irritations, which are &s;tronger than natural, as in intoxication,
<PB N="400" REF="4100">
or which precede convul&s;ions, or in&s;anity. In its &s;till more powerful degree, the &s;uperabundance of this &s;en&s;orial power actuates and invigorates the whole moving &s;y&s;tem, giving &s;trength and fre|quency to the pul&s;e, and an univer&s;al glow both of colour and of heat, as in violent anger, or outrageous in&s;anities.</P>
<P>If, in the feveri&s;h &s;leep above de&s;cribed, the &s;kin becomes cooled by the evaporation of much per&s;pirable matter, or by the application of cooler air, or thinner clothes, the actions of the cutaneous capil|laries are le&s;&s;ened by defect of the &s;timulus of heat, which counteracts the increa&s;e of &s;en&s;ibility during &s;leep, and the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries become &s;lower from the le&s;&s;ened &s;timulus of the particles of blood thus cooled in the cutaneous and pulmonary ve&s;&s;els. Hence the admi&s;&s;ion of cold air, or ablution with &s;ubtepid or with cold water, in fevers with hot &s;kin, whether they be attended with ar|terial &s;trength, or arterial debility, renders the pul&s;e &s;lower; in the former ca&s;e by dimini&s;hing the &s;timulus of the blood, and in the latter by le&s;&s;ening the expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power. See Suppl. I. 8. and 15.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Incubus.</HI> The night-mare is an imperfect &s;leep, where the de|&s;ire of locomotion is vehement, but the mu&s;cles do not obey the will; it is attended with great unea&s;ine&s;s, a &s;en&s;e of &s;uffocation, and fre|quently with fear. It is cau&s;ed by violent fatigue, or drunkenne&s;s, or indige&s;tible food, or lying on the back, or perhaps from many other kinds of unea&s;ine&s;s in our &s;leep, which may originate either from the body or mind.</P>
<P>Now as the action of re&s;piration is partly voluntary, this complaint may be owing to the irritability of the &s;y&s;tem being too &s;mall to carry on the circulation of the blood through the lungs during &s;leep, when the voluntary power is &s;u&s;pended. Whence the blood may accumu|late in them, and a painful oppre&s;&s;ion &s;upervene; as in &s;ome haemorrhages

And as much greater exerci&s;e can be borne without fatigue in cold weather than in warm; becau&s;e the exce&s;&s;ive motions of the cutane|ous ve&s;&s;els are thus prevented, and the con&s;equent wa&s;te of &s;en&s;orial power; it may be inferred, that the fatigued traveller becomes para|lytic from violent exertion as well as by the application of cold.</P>
<P>Great degrees of cold affect the motions of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els mo&s;t, which have been generally excited into action by irritation; for when the feet are much benumbed by cold, and painful, and at the &s;ame time almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to the touch of external objects, the voluntary mu&s;|cles retain their motions, and we continue to walk on; the &s;ame happens to the fingers of children in throwing &s;now-balls, the volun|tary motions of the mu&s;cles continue, though tho&s;e of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els are benumbed into inactivity.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomp&s;on, an elderly gentleman of Shrew&s;bury, was &s;eized with hemiplegia in the cold bath; which I &s;uppo&s;e might be owing to &s;ome great energy of exertion, as much as to the coldne&s;s of the water. As in the in&s;tance given of Mr. Nairn, who, by the exer|tion to &s;ave his relation, peri&s;hed him&s;elf. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 7.</P>
<P>Whence I conclude, that though heat is a fluid nece&s;&s;ary to mu&s;|cular motion, both perhaps by its &s;timulus, and by its keeping the minute component parts of the ultimate fibrils of the mu&s;cles or or|gans of &s;en&s;e at a proper di&s;tance from each other; yet that paraly&s;is, properly &s;o called, is the con&s;equence of exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power by exertion. And that the accumulations of it during the torpor of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els by expo&s;ure to cold, or of &s;ome internal vi&s;cus in the cold fits of agues, are frequently in&s;trumental in recovering the u&s;e of paralytic limbs, or of the motions of other paralytic parts of the &s;y&s;tem. See Spec. 4. of this genus.</P>
<P>Animal bodies re&s;i&s;t the power of cold probably by their exertions in con&s;equence of the pain of cold, &s;ee Botan. Gard. V. 1. additional note xii. But if the&s;e increa&s;ed exertions be too violent, &s;o as to ex|hau&s;t the &s;en&s;orial power in producing unnece&s;&s;ary motions, the animal
<PB N="405" REF="4150">
will probably &s;ooner peri&s;h. Thus a moderate quantity of wine or &s;pirit repeated at proper intervals of time might be of &s;ervice to tho&s;e, who are long expo&s;ed to exce&s;&s;ive cold, both by increa&s;ing the action of the capillary ve&s;&s;els, and thus producing heat, and perhaps by increa&s;ing in &s;ome degree the &s;ecretion of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain. But the contrary mu&s;t happen when taken immoderately, and not at due intervals. A well atte&s;ted hi&s;tory was once related to me of two men, who &s;et out on foot to travel in the &s;now, one of whom drank two or three gla&s;&s;es of brandy before they began their journey, the other contented him&s;elf with his u&s;ual diet and potation; the former of whom peri&s;hed in &s;pite of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance his companion could afford him; and the other performed his journey with &s;afety. In this ca&s;e the &s;en&s;orial power was exhau&s;ted by the unnece&s;&s;ary motions of incipient intoxication by the &s;timulus of the brandy, as well as by the exertions of walking; which &s;o weakened the dram-drinker, that the cold &s;ooner de&s;troyed him; that is, he had not power to produce &s;uf|ficient mu&s;cular or arterial action, and in con&s;equence &s;ufficient heat, to &s;upply the great expenditure of it. Hence the capillaries of the &s;kin fir&s;t cea&s;e to act, and become pale and empty; next tho&s;e which are immediately a&s;&s;ociated with them, as the extremities of the pulmonary artery, as happens on going into the cold bath. By the continued in|action of the&s;e parts of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem the blood becomes accu|mulated in the internal arteries, and the brain is &s;uppo&s;ed to be af|fected by its compre&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e the&s;e patients are &s;aid to &s;leep, or to become apoplectic, before they die. I overtook a fi&s;hman a&s;leep on his panniers on a very cold fro&s;ty night, but on waking him he did not appear to be in any degree of &s;tupor. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 1.</P>
<P>When travellers are benighted in deep &s;now, they might frequent|ly be &s;aved by covering them&s;elves in it, except a &s;mall aperture for air; in which &s;ituation the lives of hares, &s;heep, and other animals, are &s;o often pre&s;erved. The &s;now, both in re&s;pect to its component parts, and to the air contained in its pores, is a bad conductor of heat,
<PB N="406" REF="4160">
and will therefore well keep out the external cold; and as the water, when part of it di&s;&s;olves, is attracted into the pores of the remainder of it, the &s;ituation of an animal beneath it is perfectly dry; and, if he is in contact with the earth, he is in a degree of heat between 48, the medium heat of the earth, and 32, the freezing point; that is, in 40 degrees of heat, in which a man thus covered will be as warm as in bed. See Botan. Garden, V. II. notes on Anemone, Barometz, and Mu&s;chus. If the&s;e facts were more generally under&s;tood, it might annually &s;ave the lives of many.</P>
<P>After any part of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem of the body has been long ex|po&s;ed to cold, the &s;en&s;orial power is &s;o much accumulated in it, that on coming into a warm room the pain of hotach is produced, and in|flammation, and con&s;equent mortification, owing to the great exer|tion of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, when again expo&s;ed to a moderate degree of warmth. See Sect. XII. 5. Whence the propriety of applying but very low degrees of heat to limbs benumbed with cold at fir&s;t, as of &s;now in its &s;tate of di&s;&s;olving, which is at 32 degrees of heat, or of very cold water. A French writer has ob&s;erved, that if frozen ap|ples be thawed gradually by covering them with thawing &s;now, or immer&s;ing them in very cold water, that they do not lo&s;e their ta&s;te; if this fact was well a&s;certained, it might teach us how to pre&s;erve other ripe fruits in ice-hou&s;es for winter con&s;umption.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Recollectionis jactura.</HI> Lo&s;s of recollection. This is the defect of memory in old people, who forget the actions of ye&s;terday, being incapable of voluntary recollection, and yet remember tho&s;e of their youth, which by frequent repetition are introduced by a&s;&s;ociation or &s;ugge&s;tion. This is properly the paraly&s;is of the mind; the organs of &s;en&s;e do not obey the voluntary power; that is, our ideas cannot be recollected, or acted over again by the will.</P>
<P>After an apoplectic attack the patients, on beginning to recover, find them&s;elves mo&s;t at a lo&s;s in recollecting proper names of per&s;ons or places; as tho&s;e words have not been &s;o frequently a&s;&s;ociated with the ideas they &s;tand for, as the common words of a language.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Stultitia voluntaria.</HI> Voluntary folly. The ab&s;ence of volun|tary power and con&s;equent incapacity to compare the ideas of pre&s;ent and future good. Brute animals may be &s;aid to be in this &s;ituation, as they are in general excited into action only by their pre&s;ent painful or plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations. Hence though they are liable to &s;urpri&s;e, when their pa&s;&s;ing trains of ideas are di&s;&s;evered by violent &s;timuli; yet are they not affected with wonder or a&s;toni&s;hment at the novelty of objects; as they po&s;&s;e&s;s but in a very inferior degree, that volun|tary power of comparing the pre&s;ent ideas with tho&s;e previou&s;ly ac|quired, which di&s;tingui&s;hes mankind; and is termed analogical rea|&s;oning, when deliberatively exerted; and intuitive analogy, when u&s;ed without our attention to it, and which always pre&s;erves our hourly trains of ideas con&s;i&s;tent with truth and nature. See Sect. XVII. 3. 7.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Credulitas.</HI> Credulity. Life is &s;hort, opportunities of know|ledge rare; our &s;en&s;es are fallacious, our rea&s;onings uncertain, man|kind therefore &s;truggles with perpetual error from the cradle to the coffin. He is nece&s;&s;itated to correct experiment by analogy, and ana|logy by experiment; and not always to re&s;t &s;atisfied in the belief of facts even with this two-fold te&s;timony, till future opportunities, or the ob&s;ervations of others, concur in their &s;upport.</P>
<P>Ignorance and credulity have ever been companions, and have mi&s;|led and en&s;laved mankind; philo&s;ophy has in all ages endeavoured to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s, and to loo&s;en the &s;hackles they had impo&s;ed; philo&s;ophers have on this account been called unbelievers: unbelievers of what? of the fictions of fancy, of witchcraft, hobgobblins, appa|ritions, vampires, fairies; of the influence of &s;tars on human actions, miracles wrought by the bones of &s;aints, the flights of ominous birds,
<PB N="409" REF="4190">
the predictions from the bowels of dying animals, expounders of dreams, fortune-tellers, conjurors, modern prophets, necromancy, cheiromancy, animal magneti&s;m, with endle&s;s variety of folly? The&s;e they have di&s;believed and de&s;pi&s;ed, but have ever bowed their hoary heads to Truth and Nature.</P>
<P>Mankind may be divided in re&s;pect to the facility of their belief or conviction into two cla&s;&s;es; tho&s;e, who are ready to a&s;&s;ent to &s;ingle facts from the evidence of their &s;en&s;es, or from the &s;erious a&s;&s;ertions of others; and tho&s;e, who require analogy to corroborate or authen|ticate them.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t knowledge is acquired by our &s;en&s;es; but the&s;e are liable to deceive us, and we learn to detect the&s;e deceptions by comparing the ideas pre&s;ented to us by one &s;en&s;e with tho&s;e pre&s;ented by another. Thus when we fir&s;t view a cylinder, it appears to the eye as a flat &s;urface with different &s;hades on it, till we correct this idea by the &s;en&s;e of touch, and find its &s;urface to be circular; that is, having &s;ome parts gradually receding further from the eye than others. So when a child, or a cat, or a bird, fir&s;t &s;ees its own image in a looking|gla&s;s, it believes that another animal exi&s;ts before it, and detects this fallacy by going behind the gla&s;s to examine, if another tangible animal really exi&s;ts there.</P>
<P>Another exuberant &s;ource of error con&s;i&s;ts in the fal&s;e notions, which we receive in our early years from the de&s;ign or ignorance of our in&s;tructors, which affect all our future rea&s;oning by their perpe|tual intru&s;ions; as tho&s;e habits of mu&s;cular actions of the face or limbs, which are called tricks, when contracted in infancy continue to the end of our lives.</P>
<P>A third great &s;ource of error is the vivacity of our ideas of imagina|tion, which perpetually intrude them&s;elves by various a&s;&s;ociations, and compo&s;e the farrago of our dreams; in which, by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of volition, we are precluded from comparing the ideas of one &s;en&s;e with tho&s;e of another, or the incongruity of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ions with
<PB N="410" REF="4200">
the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature, and thus to detect their fallacy. Which we do in our waking hours by a perpetual voluntary exertion, a pro|ce&s;s of the mind above mentioned, which we have termed intuitive analogy. Sect. XVII. 3. 7.</P>
<P>This analogy pre&s;uppo&s;es an acquired knowledge of things, hence children and ignorant people are the mo&s;t credulous, as not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing much knowledge of the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature; and &s;econdly, tho&s;e are mo&s;t credulous, who&s;e faculty of comparing ideas, or the volun|tary exertion of it, is &s;low or imperfect. Thus if the power of the magnetic needle of turning towards the north, or the &s;hock given by touching both &s;ides of an electrized coated jar, was related for the fir&s;t time to a philo&s;opher, and to an ignorant per&s;on; the former would be le&s;s ready to believe them, than the latter; as he would find nothing &s;imilar in nature to compare them to, he would again and again repeat the experiment, before he would give it his entire credence; till by the&s;e repetitions it would cea&s;e to be a &s;ingle fact, and would therefore gain the evidence of analogy. But the latter, as having le&s;s knowledge of nature, and le&s;s facility of voluntary exer|tion, would more readily believe the a&s;&s;ertions of others, or a &s;ingle fact, as pre&s;ented to his own ob&s;ervation. Of this kind are the bulk of mankind; they continue throughout their lives in a &s;tate of child|hood, and have thus been the dupes of prie&s;ts and politicians in all countries and in all ages of the world.</P>
<P>In regard to religious matters, there is an intellectual cowardice in|&s;tilled into the minds of the people from their infancy; which pre|vents their inquiry: credulity is made an indi&s;pen&s;able virtue; to in|quire or exert their rea&s;on in religious matters is denounced as &s;inful; and in the catholic church is puni&s;hed with more &s;evere penances than moral crimes. But in re&s;pect to our belief of the &s;uppo&s;ed medical facts, which are publi&s;hed by variety of authors; many of whom are ignorant, and therefore credulous; the golden rule of David Hume may be applied with great advantage. "When two miraculous a&s;&s;ertions
<PB N="411" REF="4210">
oppo&s;e each other, believe the le&s;s miraculous." Thus if a per&s;on is &s;aid to have received the &s;mall-pox a &s;econd time, and to have gone through all the &s;tages of it, one may thus rea&s;on: twenty thou|&s;and people have been expo&s;ed to the variolous contagion a &s;econd time without receiving the variolous fever, to every one who has been &s;aid to have thus received it; it appears therefore le&s;s miraculous, that the a&s;&s;ertor of this &s;uppo&s;ed fact has been deceived, or wi&s;hes to deceive, than that it has &s;o happened contrary to the long experienced order of nature.</P>
<P>M. M. The method of cure is to increa&s;e our knowledge of the laws of nature, and our habit of comparing whatever ideas are pre&s;ented to us with tho&s;e known laws, and thus to counteract the fallacies of our &s;en&s;es, to emancipate our&s;elves from the fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ions which we have imbibed in our infancy, and to &s;et the faculty of rea&s;on above that of imagination.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A.</HI> A&s;&s;ociate Motions di&s;tingui&s;hed from Catenations.</HEAD>
<P>A&s;&s;ociate motions properly mean only tho&s;e, which are cau&s;ed by the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation. Whence it appears, that tho&s;e fibrous motions, which con&s;titute the introductory link of an a&s;&s;ociate train of motions, are excluded from this definition, as not being them&s;elves cau&s;ed by the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, but by irrita|tion, or &s;en&s;ation, or volition. I &s;hall give for example the flu&s;hing of the face after dinner; the capillary ve&s;&s;els of the face increa&s;e their actions in con&s;equence of their catenation, not their a&s;&s;ociation, with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach; which latter are cau&s;ed to act with greater energy by the irritation excited by the &s;timulus of food. The&s;e ca|pillaries of the face are a&s;&s;ociated with each other reciprocally, as being all of them excited by the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; but they are only catenated with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, which are not in this ca&s;e a&s;&s;ociate motions but irritative ones. The common u&s;e of the word a&s;&s;ociation for almo&s;t every kind of connection has rendered this &s;ub|ject difficult; from which inaccuracy I fear &s;ome parts of this work are not exempt.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD><HI>B.</HI> A&s;&s;ociate Motions of three Kinds.</HEAD>
<P>Tho&s;e trains or tribes of a&s;&s;ociate motions, who&s;e introductory link con&s;i&s;ts of an irritative motion, are termed irritative a&s;&s;ociations; as when the mu&s;cles of the eyelids clo&s;e the eye in common nictita|tion. Tho&s;e, who&s;e introductory link con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;en&s;itive motion, are termed &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociations; as when the pectoral and interco&s;tal mu&s;cles act in &s;neezing. And la&s;tly, tho&s;e, who&s;e introductory link con&s;i&s;ts of a voluntary motion, are termed voluntary a&s;&s;ociations;
<PB N="425" REF="4330">
as when the mu&s;cles of the lower limbs act in concert with tho&s;e of the arm in fencing.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD><HI>C.</HI> A&s;&s;ociations affected by external Influences.</HEAD>
<P>Circles of a&s;&s;ociate motions, as well as trains and tribes of them, are liable to be affected by external influences, which con&s;i&s;t of ethe|rial fluids, and which, by penetrating the &s;y&s;tem, act upon it perhaps rather as a cau&s;a &s;ine qu&acirc; non of its movements, than directly as a &s;timulus; except when they are accumulated in unu&s;ual quantity. We have a &s;en&s;e adapted to the perception of the exce&s;s or defect of one of the&s;e fluids; I mean that of elementary heat; in which all things are immer&s;ed. See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 4. 1. But there are others of them, which as we have no power to evade their influence, &s;o we have no &s;en&s;e to perceive it; the&s;e are the &s;olar, and lunar, and ter|re&s;trial gravitation, in which al&s;o all things are immer&s;ed; the elec|tric aura, which pervades us, and is perpetually varying, See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 4. 5; the magnetic fluid, Cla&s;s IV. 1. 4. 6; and la&s;tly, the great life-pre&s;erver oxygen gas, and the aqueous vapour of the atmo|&s;phere, &s;ee Cla&s;s IV. 1. 4. 6. and 7. and 2.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e external influences tho&s;e of heat, and of gravity, have di|urnal periods of increa&s;e and decrea&s;e; be&s;ides their greater periods of monthly or annual variation. The manner in which they act by pe|riodical increments on the &s;y&s;tem, till &s;ome effect is produced, is &s;poken of in Sect. XXXII. 3. and 6.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD><HI>D.</HI> A&s;&s;ociations affected by other Sen&s;orial Motions.</HEAD>
<P>Circles and trains of a&s;&s;ociate motions are al&s;o liable to be affected by their catenations with other &s;en&s;orial powers, as of irritation, or
<PB N="426" REF="4340">
&s;en&s;ation, or volition; which other &s;en&s;orial powers either thus &s;imply form &s;ome of the links of the catenation, or add to the energy of the a&s;&s;ociated motions. Thus when vomiting is cau&s;ed by the &s;ti|mulus of a &s;tone in the ureter, the &s;en&s;ation of pain &s;eems to be a link of the catenation rather than an efficient cau&s;e of the vomiting. But when the capillary ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin increa&s;e their action from the influence of external heat, they are excited both by the &s;timulus of unu&s;ual heat, as well as by the &s;timulus of the blood, and by their accu&s;tomed a&s;&s;ociation with the actions of the heart and arteries. And la&s;tly, in the blu&s;h of anger the &s;en&s;orial power of volition is added to that of a&s;&s;ociation, and irritation, to excite the capillaries of the face with increa&s;ed action. See Cla&s;s IV. 2. 3. 5.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD><HI>E.</HI> A&s;&s;ociations catenated with Sen&s;ation.</HEAD>
<P>Pain frequently accompanies a&s;&s;ociate trains or circles of motion without its being a cau&s;e, or a link, of them, but &s;imply an attendant &s;ymptom; though it frequently gives name to the di&s;ea&s;e, as head|ach. Thus in the cramp of the calves of the legs in diarrhoea, the increa&s;ed &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation is the proximate cau&s;e; the preceding increa&s;ed action of the bowels is the remote cau&s;e; and the proximate effect is the violent contractions of the mu&s;culi ga&s;trocne|mii; but the pain of the&s;e mu&s;cles is only an attendant &s;ymptom, or a remote effect. See Sect. XVIII. 15. Other &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociations are mentioned in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 2. and IV. 1. 2. 15.</P>
<P>Thus, if the flu&s;hing of the face above mentioned after dinner be called a di&s;ea&s;e, the immediate or proximate cau&s;e is the increa&s;ed power of a&s;&s;ociation, the remote cau&s;e is the increa&s;ed irritative mo|tions of the &s;tomach in con&s;equence of the &s;timulus of food and wine. The di&s;ea&s;e or proximate effect con&s;i&s;ts in the increa&s;ed actions of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els of the face; and the &s;en&s;ation of heat, the exi&s;tence
<PB N="427" REF="4350">
of heat, and the red colour, are attendants or &s;ymptoms, or remote effects, of the increa&s;ed actions of the&s;e cutaneous ve&s;&s;els.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD><HI>F.</HI> Direct and rever&s;e Sympathy.</HEAD>
<P>The increa&s;ed actions of the primary part of the trains of a&s;&s;ociated motions are &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded by increa&s;ed actions of the &s;econdary part of the train; and &s;ometimes by decrea&s;ed actions of it. So like|wi&s;e the decrea&s;ed actions of the primary part of a train of a&s;&s;ociate motions are &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded by decrea&s;ed actions of the &s;econdary part, and &s;ometimes by increa&s;ed actions of it. The former of the&s;e &s;ituations is called direct &s;ympathy, and the latter rever&s;e &s;ympathy. In general I believe, where the primary part of the train of a&s;&s;ociated motions is exerted more than natural, it produces direct &s;ympathy in &s;trong people, and rever&s;e &s;ympathy in weak ones, as a full meal makes &s;ome people hot, and others chill. And where the primary part of the train is exerted le&s;s than natural, it produces direct &s;ym|pathy in weak people, and rever&s;e &s;ympathy in &s;trong ones, as on being expo&s;ed for a certain length of time on hor&s;eback in a cold day gives indige&s;tion and con&s;equent heart-burn to weak people, and &s;trengthens the dige&s;tion, and induces con&s;equent hunger in &s;trong ones. See Sect. XXXV. 1.</P>
<P>This may perhaps be more ea&s;ily under&s;tood, by con&s;idering &s;trength and weakne&s;s, when applied to animal bodies, as con&s;i&s;ting in the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power re&s;iding in the contracting fibres, and the quantity of &s;timulus applied, as &s;hewn in Sect. XII. 2. 1. Now when defective &s;timulus, within certain limits, is partially ap|plied to parts &s;ubject to perpetual motion, the expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power is for a while le&s;&s;ened, but not its general production in the brain, nor its derivation into the weakly-&s;timulated part. Hence in &s;trong people, or &s;uch who&s;e fibres abound with &s;en&s;orial power, if
<PB N="428" REF="4360">
the fir&s;t tribe of an a&s;&s;ociate train of motions be deprived in part of its accu&s;tomed &s;timulus, its action becomes dimini&s;hed; and the &s;en&s;o|rial power becomes accumulated, and by its &s;uperabundance, or over|flowing as it were, increa&s;es the action of the &s;econd tribe of the a&s;|&s;ociate actions by rever&s;e &s;ympathy. As expo&s;ing the warm &s;kin for a moderate time to cold air increa&s;es the action of the &s;tomach, and thus &s;trengthens the power of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>On the rever&s;e, when additional &s;timulus within certain limits is partially applied to parts, which are deficient in re&s;pect to the natural quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, the expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power is in|crea&s;ed, but in a le&s;s degree than the increa&s;ed production of it in the brain, or its increa&s;ed derivation into the &s;trongly-&s;timulated organ. Hence in weak people, or &s;uch who&s;e fibres are deficient of &s;en&s;orial power, if the fir&s;t tribe of an a&s;&s;ociate train of motions be &s;ubjected for a while to greater &s;timulus than u&s;ual, a greater production of &s;en|&s;orial power, or a greater derivation of it into the &s;timulated parts oc|curs; which by its exce&s;s, or overflowing as it were, increa&s;es the actions of the &s;econd tribe of the a&s;&s;ociate motions by direct &s;ympathy. Thus when vomiting occurs with cold extremities, a bli&s;ter on the back in a few hours occa&s;ions univer&s;al warmth of the &s;kin, and &s;tops the vomiting. And when a diarrhoea occurs with pale &s;kin and cold extremities, the pricking of the points of a flannel &s;hirt, worn next the &s;kin, occa&s;ions univer&s;al warmth of it, and checks or cures the diarrhoea.</P>
<P>In &s;ome a&s;&s;ociate trains of action neverthele&s;s rever&s;e &s;ympathies more frequently occur than direct ones, and in others direct ones more frequently than rever&s;e ones. Thus in continued fever with debility there appears to be a rever&s;e &s;ympathy between the capillary ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tomach and tho&s;e of the &s;kin; becau&s;e there exi&s;ts a total aver&s;ion to &s;olid food, and con&s;tant heat on the &s;urface of the body. Yet the&s;e two &s;y&s;tems of ve&s;&s;els are at other times actuated by direct &s;ympathy, as when palene&s;s attends &s;ickne&s;s, or cold feet induces
<PB N="429" REF="4370">
indige&s;tion. This &s;ubject requires to be further inve&s;tigated, as it probably depends not only on the pre&s;ent or previous plus or minus of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, but al&s;o on the introduc|tion of other kinds of &s;en&s;orial power, as in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. D; or the increa&s;ed production of it in the brain, or the greater mobility of one part of a train of actions than another.</P>
<P>Thus when much food or wine is taken into the &s;tomach, if there be no &s;uperfluity of &s;en&s;orial power in the &s;y&s;tem, that is, none to be &s;pared from the continual actions of it, a palene&s;s and chillne&s;s &s;uc|ceeds for a time; becau&s;e now the expenditure of it by the increa&s;ed actions of the &s;tomach is greater than the pre&s;ent production of it. In a little time however the &s;timulus of the food and wine increa&s;es the production of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain, and this produces a &s;uper|fluity of it in the &s;y&s;tem; in con&s;equence of which the &s;kin now be|comes warm and florid, which was at fir&s;t cold and pale; and thus the rever&s;e &s;ympathy is &s;hortly converted into a direct one; which is probably owing to the introduction of a &s;econd &s;en&s;orial power, that of plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>On the contrary, when an emetic drug produces &s;ickne&s;s, the &s;kin is at fir&s;t pale for a time by direct &s;ympathy with the capillaries of the &s;tomach; but in a few minutes, by the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the &s;tomach during its le&s;s active &s;tate in &s;ickne&s;s, the ca|pillaries of the &s;kin, which are a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, act with greater energy by rever&s;e &s;ympathy, and a florid colour re|turns. Where the quantity of action is dimini&s;hed in the fir&s;t part of a train of motions, whether by previous diminution of &s;en&s;orial power, or pre&s;ent diminution of &s;timulus, the &s;econd part of the train be|comes torpid by direct &s;ympathy. And when the quantity of action of the fir&s;t part becomes increa&s;ed by the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during its previous torpor, or by increa&s;e of &s;timulus, the actions of the &s;econd part of it likewi&s;e become increa&s;ed by direct &s;ympathy.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="4380">
In moderate hunger the &s;kin is pale, as before dinner, and in mo|derate &s;ickne&s;s, as no great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power has commenced; but in violent hunger, and in greater torpor of the &s;tomach, as from contagious matter, the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power becomes &s;o great as to affect the arterial and capillary &s;y&s;tem, and fever is produced in both ca&s;es.</P>
<P>In contagious fevers with arterial debilities commencing with tor|por of the &s;tomach, why is the action of the heart weakened, and that of the capillaries increa&s;ed? Is it becau&s;e the mobility of the hear$ is le&s;s than that of the &s;tomach, and the mobility of the capillaries greater? Or is it becau&s;e the a&s;&s;ociation between the mu&s;cular fibres of the &s;tomach and tho&s;e of the heart have been uniformly a&s;&s;ociated by direct &s;ympathy; and the capillaries of the &s;tomach and tho&s;e of the &s;kin have been more frequently a&s;&s;ociated by rever&s;e &s;ym|pathy?</P>
<P>Where the actions of the &s;tomach have been previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted by long &s;timulus, as on the day after intoxication, little or no accu|mulation of &s;en&s;orial power occurs, during the torpor of the organ, beyond what is required to replace the deficiency of it, and hence fever &s;eldom follows intoxication. And a repetition of the &s;timulus &s;ometimes becomes nece&s;&s;ary even to induce its natural action, as in dram-drinkers.</P>
<P>Where there has been no previous exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power, and the primary link of a&s;&s;ociate motions is violently actuated by the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation, the &s;econdary link is al&s;o violently ac|tuated by direct &s;ympathy, as in inflammatory fevers. Where how|ever the &s;en&s;orial power of the &s;y&s;tem is le&s;s than natural, the &s;econ|dary link of a&s;&s;ociated motions becomes torpid by rever&s;e &s;ympathy, as in the inoculated &s;mall-pox during the eruption on the face the feet are frequently cold.</P>

<HEAD><HI>G.</HI> A&s;&s;ociations affected four Ways.</HEAD>
<P>Hence a&s;&s;ociated trains or circles of motions may be affected four different ways. 1. By the greater or le&s;s energy of action of the fir&s;t link with which they are catenated, and from which they take their names; as irritative, &s;en&s;itive, or voluntary a&s;&s;ociations. 2. By being excited by two or more &s;en&s;orial powers at the &s;ame time, as by irritation and a&s;&s;ociation, as in the in&s;tance of the application of the &s;timulus of increa&s;ed external heat to the cutaneous capillaries. 3. By catenation with other &s;en&s;orial powers, as with pain or plea&s;ure, which are in this ca&s;e not the proximate cau&s;e of motion, but which, by becoming a link of catenation, excites the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;|&s;ociation into action; as the pain at the neck of the gall-bladder oc|ca&s;ioned by a gall-&s;tone is transferred to the other end of that canal, and becomes a link of catenation between the action of the two ex|tremities of it. 4. The influence of ethereal fluids, as of heat and gravitation. To which la&s;t perhaps might be added moi&s;ture and oxygen gas as con&s;tituting nece&s;&s;ary parts of the &s;y&s;tem, rather than &s;timuli to excite it into action.</P>

<HEAD><HI>H.</HI> The Origin of A&s;&s;ociations.</HEAD>
<P>Some trains or circles of a&s;&s;ociate motions mu&s;t have been formed before our nativity, as tho&s;e of the heart, arteries, and capillaries; others have been a&s;&s;ociated, as occa&s;ion required them, as the mu&s;|cles of the diaphragm and abdomen in vomiting; and others by per|petual habit, as tho&s;e of the &s;tomach with the heart and arteries di|rectly, as in weak pul&s;e during &s;ickne&s;s; with the capillaries directly, as in the flu&s;hed &s;kin after dinner; and la&s;tly, with the c$llular ab&s;orbents
<PB N="432" REF="4400">
rever&s;ely, as in the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption in ana&s;arca during &s;ickne&s;s; and with the irritative motions of the organs of &s;en&s;e re|ver&s;ely, as in vertigo, or &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s. Some of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations &s;hall be here &s;hortly de&s;cribed to facilitate the inve&s;tigation of others.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, other congeries of glands occupy but a particular part of the &s;y&s;tem, or con&s;titute a particular organ, as the liver, or kidneys; but tho&s;e glands, which &s;ecrete the mucus, and per&s;pirable matter, which are called capillaries, are of very great extent; they receive the blood from the arteries, &s;eparate from it the mucus, which lines every cell, and covers every cavity of body; and the per&s;pirable mat|ter, which &s;oftens and lubricates the whole &s;urface of the &s;kin, and the more exten&s;ive &s;urface of the air-ve&s;&s;els, which compo&s;e the lungs. The&s;e are &s;upplied with blood by the perpetual action of the heart and arteries, and have therefore their motions a&s;&s;ociated with the former, and with each other, by &s;ympathy, which is &s;ometimes di|rect, and &s;ometimes rever&s;e.</P>
<P>One branch of this a&s;&s;ociation, the capillaries of the &s;kin, are very irritable by the increa&s;ed quantities of cold and heat, another branch, that of the lungs, has not the perception of cold and heat, but is liable by direct &s;ympathy to act in concert with the former, as in going into the cold bath. And it is probable the capillaries of the internal mem|branes are likewi&s;e directly affected by their &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the &s;kin, as appears from the defect of &s;ecretion in ulcers during the cold fits of agues.</P>
<P>The motions of this exten&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of capillaries, thus a&s;&s;ociated by direct &s;ympathy, are al&s;o a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e of the heart and ar|teries, &s;ometimes by rever&s;e and &s;ometimes by direct &s;ympathy; and thus con&s;titute &s;imple fever.

<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Of the Action of Vomiting.</HEAD>
<P>The manner, in which the &s;tomach and the diaphragm and abdo|minal mu&s;cles acquire their a&s;&s;ociate action in vomiting, requires &s;ome attention. It is not probable, that this action of vomiting oc|curs before nativity; as the uniform application of the nutritive liquor amnii to the mouth of the foetus, and the uniform expenditure of its nouri&s;hment, would not &s;eem to give occa&s;ion to too great temporary repletion of the &s;tomach; and would preclude the deglutition of any improper material. After nativity the &s;tomach of the child may be occa&s;ionally too much di&s;tended with milk; as previous hunger may induce it to overgorge it&s;elf; and by repeated efforts the act of vo|miting is learned, as a means of getting free from a di&s;agreeable &s;en|&s;ation. Thus when any di&s;gu&s;tful material, as a bitter drug, is taken into the mouth; certain retrograde motions of the tongue and lips are produced, for the purpo&s;e of putting the di&s;agreeable material out of the mouth again.</P>
<P>When the &s;tomach is di&s;agreeably &s;timulated by the di&s;tention or acrimony of the aliment, a &s;imilar effort to regurgitate it mu&s;t occur; and by repeated trials the action of the diaphragm and abdominal mu&s;|cles by &s;queezing the &s;tomach a&s;&s;i&s;ts its retrograde exertion to di&s;|gorge its contents. In the &s;ame manner when a piece of gravel is pu&s;hed into the urethra, or a piece of indurated bile into the neck of the gall-bladder, after they have been in vain pre&s;&s;ed forward by the u&s;ual motions of tho&s;e ducts, they return into the bladders of gall and urine by the retrograde motions of them.</P>
<P>That this is one mode, in which vomiting is induced, appears from the in&s;tantaneous rejection from the &s;tomach occa&s;ioned by &s;ome nau|&s;eous drug, or from &s;ome nau&s;eous idea; and la&s;tly, from the voluntary
<PB N="434" REF="4420">
power, which &s;ome people have been &s;aid to have acquired, of emptying their &s;tomachs, much in the &s;ame manner as ruminating animals bring up the gra&s;s from their fir&s;t &s;tomach.</P>
<P>There are neverthele&s;s many modes by which the&s;e inverted mo|tions of the &s;tomach and oe&s;ophagus are induced, and which it is of con&s;equence to di&s;tingui&s;h from each other. The fir&s;t is the mode above de&s;cribed, where an effort is made to di&s;lodge &s;omething, which &s;timulates the &s;tomach into di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation; and which is re|turned by repeated exertions; as when a nau&s;eous drug is taken into the mouth, or a bit of &s;and falls into the eye, or a drop of water into the wind-pipe. In this the peri&s;taltic motions of the &s;tomach are fir&s;t &s;topped, and then reverted by painful &s;en&s;ation; and the abdominal mu&s;cles and diaphragm by repeated efforts become a&s;&s;ociated with them. Now as le&s;s &s;en&s;orial power is expended on the retrograde ac|tions of the &s;tomach, and of the lymphatics, which open their mouths on its &s;urface, than by their natural motions, an accumula|tion of &s;en&s;orial power in the fibres of the &s;tomach follows the exhibi|tion of an emetic, and on that account an emetic will &s;ometimes &s;top a &s;pontaneous vomiting which was owing to &s;en&s;orial deficiency. See Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. and Art. V. 2. 1.</P>
<P>As bitters and metallic &s;alts, exhibited in &s;mall do&s;es, &s;timulate the &s;tomach into greater action, as appears by their increa&s;ing the power of dige&s;tion, and yet become emetic, when given in larger do&s;es; one might &s;u&s;pect, that they became emetic by inducing debility, and con&s;equent retrograde actions of the &s;tomach, by their previou&s;ly ex|hau&s;ting the &s;en&s;orial power by their great &s;timulus; which might be effected in a moment without producing pain, and in con&s;equence without our perceiving it. But on the contrary, there does not in general appear on the exhibition of emetics to be any previous ex|hau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power; becau&s;e there is evidently an accumula|tion of it during the &s;ickne&s;s, as appears from the dige&s;tion being
<PB N="435" REF="4430">
&s;tronger afterwards; and from the increa&s;$d action of the cellular and cutaneous ab&s;orbents during its operation. See Art. V. 2. 1.</P>
<P>Another mode, by which vomiting is induced, is owing to debi|lity or deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power, from the previous exhau&s;tion of it; as on the day after intoxication, or which occurs in people enfeebled with the gout, and in drop&s;y, and in &s;ome fevers with debility. In the&s;e, when the vomiting cea&s;es, there is no appear|ance of accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, as the dige&s;tion &s;till remains weak and imperfect.</P>
<P>Another mode by which &s;ickne&s;s or vomiting is induced, is by defect of &s;timulus, as in great hunger; and in tho&s;e, who have been habituated to &s;pice and &s;pirit with their meals, who are liable to be &s;ick after taking food without the&s;e additional $timuli. Other means of inducing &s;ickne&s;s by vertigo, or by nau&s;eous ideas, will be men|tioned below.</P>
<P>We &s;hall only add, that the motions of the mu&s;cular fibres of the &s;tomach are a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e of the heart and arteries by direct &s;ympathy, as appears by the weakne&s;s of the pul&s;e during the exhi|bition of an emetic; and that the ab&s;orbents of the &s;tomach are a&s;&s;o|ciated with the cellular and cutaneous ab&s;orbents by rever&s;e &s;ympathy, as is &s;hewn by the great ab&s;orption of the mucus of the cells in ana|&s;arca during &s;ickne&s;s; at the &s;ame time that the ab&s;orbents of the &s;tomach invert their actions, and pour the mucus and water thus ab&s;orbed into that vi&s;cus.</P>
<P>In cold paroxy&s;ms of fever the &s;tomach partakes of the general torpor, and vomiting is induced by its debility, either by its a&s;&s;o|ciation with the torpid capillaries, or other torpid parts, or by its own torpor commencing fir&s;t, and cau&s;ing the cold fit. The di&s;or|dered motions of the &s;tomach frequently &s;eem to be the cau&s;e or primary &s;eat of fever, as where contagious mia&s;mata are &s;wallowed with the &s;aliva, and where fever is produced by &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, which I once &s;aw. Neverthele&s;s a di&s;order of the &s;tomach does not always

induce fever, as in that ca&s;e it &s;hould con&s;tantly attend indige&s;tion, and vertigo, and &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s; but is it&s;elf frequently induced by a&s;&s;ociation with the di&s;ordered movements of other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, as when it ari&s;es from gravel in the ureter, or from a per|cu&s;&s;ion on the head.</P>
<P>The connexion of the motions of the &s;tomach with irritative ideas, or motions of the organs of &s;en&s;e, in vertigo, is &s;hewn in Sect. XX. and thus it appears, that many circles of a&s;&s;ociation are either directly or rever&s;ely a&s;&s;ociated, or catenated, with this vi&s;cus; which will much contribute to unfold &s;ome of the &s;ymptoms of fever.</P>

In the beginning of intoxication the whole &s;kin becomes florid from the a&s;&s;ociation of the actions of the cutaneous arteries with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, becau&s;e vinous &s;pirit excites the fibres of the &s;tomach into more violent action than the &s;timulus of common food; and the cutaneous capillaries of the face, from their more frequent expo&s;ure to the vici&s;&s;itudes of cold and heat,
<PB N="437" REF="4450">
po&s;&s;e&s;s more mobility or irritability than tho&s;e of other parts of the &s;kin, as further explained in Sect. XXXIII. 2. 10. Vinegar is liable to produce this flu&s;hing of the face, which probably is owing to the quantity of vinous &s;pirit it contains, as I believe the unfermented vegetable acids do not produce this effect. In every kind of blu&s;h the arterial blood is propelled into the capillaries fa&s;ter than the venous ab&s;orption can carry it forwards into the veins, in this re&s;pect re&s;embling the ten&s;io phalli.</P>
<P>Can the beginning vinous or acetous fermentation of the aliment in weak &s;tomachs contribute to this effect? or is it to be a&s;cribed to the greater power of a&s;&s;ociation between the arteries of the face and the fibres of the &s;tomach in &s;ome people than in others?</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Sudor &s;tragulis immerforum.</HI> Sweat from being covered in bed. In the commencement of an epidemic fever, in which the perpetual efforts to vomit was a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptom, Dr. Sydenham di&s;co|vered, that if the patient's head was for a &s;hort time covered over with the bed clothes, warmth was produced, and a &s;weat broke out upon the &s;kin, and the tendency to vomit cea&s;ed. In this curious fact two trains of a&s;&s;ociated motions are excited into increa&s;ed action. Fir&s;t, the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs are known to have their motion a&s;&s;o|ciated with tho&s;e of the &s;kin by the difficulty of breathing on going into the cold bath, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XXXII. 3. 2. Hence, when the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs become excited into &s;tronger action, by the bad air under the bed clothes, warmed and adulterated by frequent breathing, tho&s;e of the external &s;kin &s;oon become excited by their a&s;&s;ociation into more energetic action, and generate more heat along with a greater &s;ecretion of per&s;pirable matter. Secondly, the &s;ympathy
<PB N="438" REF="4460">
between the &s;tomach and &s;kin is evident in variety of circum|&s;tances; thus the cold air of fro&s;ty days applied to the &s;kin for a &s;hort time increa&s;es the action of the &s;tomach by rever&s;e &s;ympathy, but decrea&s;es it if continued too long by direct &s;ympathy; &s;o in the circum&s;tance above mentioned the action of the &s;tomach is increa&s;ed by direct &s;ympathy with that of the &s;kin; and the tendency to vomit, which was owing to its dimini&s;hed action, cea&s;es.</P>

The bli&s;ter &s;timulates the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els into greater action; whence warmth and pain are produced at the &s;ame time, and the fibres of the &s;tomach are excited into greater action by their a&s;&s;o|ciation with tho&s;e of the &s;kin. It does not appear, that the con|comitant pain of the bli&s;ter cau&s;es the increa&s;ed energy of the &s;tomach, becau&s;e the motions of it are not greater than natural; though it is &s;ometimes difficult to determine, whether the primary part of &s;ome a&s;&s;ociated trains be connected with irritative or &s;en&s;itive motions.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner a flannel &s;hirt, to one who has not been in the habit of wearing one, &s;timulates the &s;kin by its points, and thus &s;tops vomiting in &s;ome ca&s;es; and is particularly efficacious in check|ing &s;ome chronical diarrhoeas, which are not attended with fever; for the ab&s;orbents of the &s;kin are thus &s;timulated into greater action, with which tho&s;e of the inte&s;tines con&s;ent by direct &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>This effect cannot be a&s;cribed to the warmth alone of the flannel &s;hirt, as being a covering of loo&s;e texture, and confining air in its pores, like a &s;ponge, which air is known to be a bad conductor of

The di&s;ea&s;es above explained in this genus are chiefly concerning the &s;ympathies of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, or the alimentary canal, which are not &s;o much a&s;&s;ociated with the arterial &s;y&s;tem, as to throw it into di&s;order, when they are &s;lightly deranged; but when any great congeries of conglomerate glands, which may be con&s;idered as the extremities of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, are affected with torpor, the whole arterial &s;y&s;tem and the heart &s;ympathize with the torpid glands, and act with le&s;s energy; which con&s;titutes the cold fit of fever; which is therefore at fir&s;t a decrea&s;ed action of the a&s;&s;ociate organ; but as this decrea&s;e of action is only a temporary effect, and an increa&s;e of exertion both of the torpid glands, and of the whole arterial &s;y&s;tem, &s;oon follows; the hot fit of irritative fever, or fever with &s;trong pul&s;e, properly belongs to this cla&s;s and genus of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<P>THE primary links of the a&s;&s;ociated actions of this genus are either produced or attended by painful or plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation. The &s;e|condary links of the fir&s;t ten &s;pecies are attended with increa&s;ed mo|tions without inflammation, tho&s;e of the remainder are attended with inflammation. All inflammations, which do not ari&s;e in the part which was previou&s;ly torpid, belong to this genus; as the gout, rheu|mati&s;m, ery&s;ipelas. It is probable many other inflammations may, by future ob&s;ervation, require to be tran&s;planted into this cla&s;s.</P>
<P>The circles of &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociate motions con&s;i&s;t chiefly of the ex|cretory ducts of the capillaries and of the mouths of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which con&s;titute the membranes; and which have been in|duced into action at the &s;ame time; or they con&s;i&s;t of the termina|tions of canals; or of parts which are endued with greater &s;en&s;ibility than tho&s;e which form the fir&s;t link of the a&s;&s;ociation. An in&s;tance of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e is the &s;ympathy between the membranes of the alveolar proce&s;&s;es of the jaws, and the membranes above or beneath the mu&s;cles about the temples in hemicrania. An in&s;tance of the &s;econd is in the &s;ympathy between the excretory duct of the lacrymal gland, and the na&s;al duct of the lacrymal &s;ack.

<HEAD>SPECIES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Lacrymarum fluxus &s;ympatheticus.</HI> A flow of tears from grief or joy. When the termination of the duct of the lacrymal &s;ac in the no&s;trils becomes affected either by painful or plea&s;urable &s;en&s;a|tions, in con&s;equence of external &s;timulus, or by its a&s;&s;ociation with agreeable or di&s;agreeable ideas, the motions of the lacrymal gland are at the &s;ame time exerted with greater energy, and a profu&s;ion of tears &s;ucceeds by &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 2.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e there exi&s;ts a chain of a&s;&s;ociated actions, the &s;ecretion of the lacrymal gland is increa&s;ed by whatever &s;timulates the &s;urface of the eye, at the &s;ame time the increa&s;ed abundance of tears &s;timu|lates the puncta lacrymalia into greater action; and the fluid thus ab&s;orbed &s;timulates the lacrymal &s;ac, and its na&s;al duct in the no&s;e into greater action. In a contrary direction of this chain of a&s;&s;o|ciation the pre&s;ent increa&s;e of action is induced. Fir&s;t, the na&s;al duct of the lacrymal &s;ac is excited into increa&s;ed action by &s;ome plea|&s;urable or painful idea, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XVI. 8. 2. 2d. The puncta lacrymalia or other extremity of the lacrymal &s;ac &s;ympa|thizes with it (as the two ends of all other canals &s;ympathize with each other). 3d. With the&s;e increa&s;ed motions of the puncta lacry|malia tho&s;e of the excretory duct of the lacrymal gland are a&s;&s;ociated from their having &s;o perpetually acted together. And, la&s;tly, with the increa&s;ed actions of the excretory duct of this gland are a&s;&s;ociated tho&s;e of the other end of it by their frequently acting together; in the &s;ame manner as the extremities of other canals are a&s;&s;ociated; and thus a greater flow of tears is poured into the eye.</P>
<P>When a flow of tears is produced in grief, it is believed to relieve the violence of it, which is worthy a further inquiry. Painful &s;en|&s;ations, when great, excite the faculty of volition; and the per&s;on continues voluntarily to call up or perform tho&s;e ideas, which occa&s;ion
<PB N="444" REF="4520">
the painful &s;en&s;ation; that is, the afflicted per&s;on becomes &s;o far in|&s;ane or melancholy; but tears are produced by the &s;en&s;orial faculty of a&s;&s;ociation, and &s;hew that the pain is &s;o far relieved as not to ex|cite the exce&s;&s;ive power of volition, or in&s;anity, and are therefore a &s;ign of the abatement of the painful &s;tate of grief, rather than a cau&s;e of that abatement. See Cla&s;s III. 1. 2. 10.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sternutatio a lumine.</HI> Some per&s;ons &s;neeze from looking up at the light &s;ky in a morning after coming out of a dark bedroom. The olfactory nerves are brought into too great action by their &s;ympathy with the optic nerves, or by their re&s;pective &s;ympathies with &s;ome intervening parts, as probably with the two extremities of the lacry|mal &s;ac; that is, with the puncta lacrymalia and the na&s;al duct. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 1. 3.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Dolor dentium Stridore.</HI> Tooth-edge from grating &s;ounds, and from the touch of certain &s;ub&s;tances, and even from imagination alone, is de&s;cribed and explained in Sect. XVI. 10. The increa&s;ed actions of the alveolar ve&s;&s;els or membranes are a&s;&s;ociated with the ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions of the auditory nerves in the fir&s;t ca&s;e; and of tho&s;e of the &s;en&s;e of touch, in the &s;econd ca&s;e; and by imagination, or ideas exerted of painful &s;en&s;ation alone, in the la&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Ri&s;us &s;ardonicus.</HI> A di&s;agreeable &s;mile attends inflammations of the diaphragm ari&s;ing from the a&s;&s;ociations of the reiterated exertions of that mu&s;cle with tho&s;e of the lips and checks in laughing. See Diaphragmitis, Cla&s;s II. 1. 2. 6.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Salivae fluxus cibo vi&s;o.</HI> The flow of &s;aliva into the mouths of hungry animals at the &s;ight or &s;mell of food is &s;een in dogs &s;tanding round a dinner-table. The increa&s;ed actions of the &s;alivary glands have been u&s;ually produced by the &s;timulus of agreeable food on their
<PB N="445" REF="4530">
excretory ducts during the ma&s;tication of it; and with this increa&s;ed action of their excretory ducts the other terminations of tho&s;e glands in the capillary arteries have been excited into increa&s;ed action by the mutual a&s;&s;ociation of the ends of canals; and at the &s;ame time the plea&s;urable ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions, of the &s;en&s;e of &s;mell and of &s;ight have accompanied this increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of &s;aliva. Hence this chain of motions becomes a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e vi&s;ual or olfactory ideas, or with the plea&s;ure, which produces or attends them.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Ten&s;io mamularum vi&s;o puerulo.</HI> The nipples of lacte&s;cent women are liable to become turgid at the &s;ight of their young off|&s;pring. The nipple has generally been rendered turgid by the titilla|tion of the lips or gums of the child in giving &s;uck; the vi&s;ible idea of the child has thus frequently accompanied this plea&s;urable &s;en&s;a|tion of parting with the milk, and turge&s;cence of the tubes, which con&s;titute the nipple. Hence the vi&s;ual idea of the child, and the plea&s;ure which attends it, become a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e increa&s;ed arterial actions, which &s;well the cells of the mamula, and extend its tubes; which is very &s;imilar to the ten&s;io phalli vi&s;&acirc; muliere nud&acirc; etiam in in&s;omnio.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Ten&s;io penis in hydrophobia.</HI> An erection of the penis occurs in the hydrophobia, and is a trouble&s;ome &s;ymptom, as ob&s;erved by Coelius Aurelianus, Fothergill, and Vaughn, and would &s;eem to be produced by an unexplained &s;ympathy between the &s;en&s;ations about the fauces and the penis. In men the hair grows about both the&s;e parts, the voice changes, and the neck thickens at puberty. In the mumps, when the &s;wellings about the throat &s;ub&s;ides, the te&s;ticles are liable to &s;well. Venereal infection received by the penis is very liable to affect the throat with ulcers. Violent coughs, with &s;orene&s;s or rawne&s;s about the fauces are often attended with erection of the penis; which is al&s;o &s;aid to happen to male animals, that are hanged;
<PB N="446" REF="4540">
which la&s;t circum&s;tance has generally been a&s;cribed to the ob&s;truction of the circulation of the blood, but is more probably occa&s;ioned by the &s;timulus of the cord in compre&s;&s;ing the throat; &s;ince if it was owing to impeded circulation it ought equally to occur in drowning animals.</P>
<P>In men the throat becomes &s;o thickened at the time of puberty, that a mea&s;ure of this is u&s;ed to a&s;certain the payment of a poll-tax on males in &s;ome of the i&s;lands of the Mediterranean, which com|mences at puberty; a &s;tring is wrapped twice round the thinne&s;t part of the neck, the ends of it are then put into each corner of the mouth; and if, when thus held in the teeth, it pa&s;&s;es readily over the head, the &s;ubject is taxable.</P>
<P>It is difficult to point out by what circum&s;tance the &s;en&s;itive mo|tions of the penis and of the throat and no&s;e become a&s;&s;ociated; I can only ob&s;erve, that the&s;e parts are &s;ubjected to greater plea&s;urable &s;en|&s;ations than any other parts of the body; one being de&s;igned to pre|&s;erve our&s;elves by the plea&s;ure attending the &s;mell and deglutition of food, and the other to en&s;ure the propagation of our &s;pecies; and may thus gain an a&s;&s;ociation of their &s;en&s;itive motion by their being eminently &s;en&s;ible to plea&s;ure. See Cla&s;s I. 3. 1. 11. and III. 1. 1. 15. and Sect. XVI. 5.</P>
<P>In the female &s;ex this a&s;&s;ociation between the face, throat, no&s;e, and pubis does not exi&s;t; whence no hair grows on their chins at the time of puberty, nor does their voices change, or their necks thicken. This happens probably from there being in them a more exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;itive &s;ympathy between the pubis and the brea&s;ts. Hence their brea&s;ts &s;well at the time of puberty, and &s;ecrete milk at the time of parturition. And in the parotitis, or mumps, the brea&s;ts of women &s;well, when the tumor of the parotitis &s;ub&s;ides. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 15. Whence it would appear, that their brea&s;ts po&s;&s;e&s;s an intermediate &s;ympathy between the pubis and the throat; as they are the &s;eat of a pa&s;&s;ion, which men do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, that of &s;uckling children.</P>

8. <HI>Tene&s;inus calculo&s;us.</HI> The &s;phincter of the rectum becomes painful or inflamed from the a&s;&s;ociation of its &s;en&s;itive motions with tho&s;e of the &s;phincter of the bladder, when the latter is &s;timulated into violent pain or inflammation by a &s;tone.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Polypus narium ex a&s;caridibus?</HI> The &s;timulation of a&s;carides in the rectum produces by &s;en&s;itive &s;ympathy an itching of the no&s;e, as explained in IV. 2. 2. 6; and in three children I have &s;een a polypus in the no&s;e, who were all affected with a&s;carides; to the perpetual &s;timulation of which, and the con&s;equent &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation, I was led to a&s;cribe the inflammation and thickening of the membrane of the no&s;trils.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Crampus &s;urarum in cholera.</HI> A cramp of the mu&s;cles of the legs occurs in violent diarrhoea, or cholera, and from the u&s;e of too much acid diet in gouty habits. This &s;eems to &s;ympathize with unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation in the bowels. See Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. 14. This a&s;&s;ociation is not ea&s;ily accounted for, but is analogous in &s;ome degree to the paraly&s;is of the mu&s;cles of the arms in colica &s;aturnina. It would &s;eem, that the mu&s;cles of the legs in walking get a &s;ympathy with the lower parts of the inte&s;tines, and tho&s;e of the arms in variety of employment obtain a &s;ympathy with the higher parts of them.

When the torpor or beginning inflammation of this mem|brane cea&s;es, the external &s;kin becomes inflamed in its &s;tead, and a kind of herpes, called the &s;hingles, covers the loins and &s;ides of the belly. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 5. 9.</P>

12. <HI>Eruptio variolarum.</HI> After the inflammation of the inoculated arm has &s;pread for a quarter of a lunation, it affects the &s;tomach by rever&s;e &s;ympathy; that is, the actions of the &s;tomach are a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e of the &s;kin; and as much &s;en&s;orial power is now exerted on the inflamed &s;kin, the other part of this &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation is de|prived of its natural &s;hare, and becomes torpid, or inverts its mo|tions. After this torpor of the &s;tomach has continued a time, and much &s;en&s;orial power is thus accumulated; other parts of the &s;kin, which are al&s;o a&s;&s;ociated with it, as that of the face fir&s;t, are thrown into partial inflammation; that is, the eruptions of the &s;mall-pox appear on the face.</P>
<P>For that the variolous matter affects the &s;tomach previous to its eruption on the &s;kin appears from the &s;ickne&s;s at the commencement of the fever; and becau&s;e, when the morbid motions affect the &s;kin, tho&s;e of the &s;tomach cea&s;e; as in the gout and ery&s;ipelas, mentioned below. The con&s;ent between the &s;tomach and the &s;kin appears in variety of other di&s;ea&s;es; and as they both con&s;i&s;t of &s;urfaces, which ab&s;orb and &s;ecrete a quantity of moi&s;ture, their motions mu&s;t fre|quently be produced together or in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; which is the founda|tion of all the &s;ympathies of animal motions, whether of the irritative, &s;en&s;itive, or voluntary kinds.</P>
<P>Now as the &s;kin, which covers the face, is expo&s;ed to greater va|riations of heat and cold than any other part of the body; it probably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more mobility to &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociations, not only than the &s;tomach, but than any other part of the &s;kin; and is thence affected at the eruption of the &s;mall-pox with violent action and con&s;equent inflammation, by the a&s;&s;ociation of its motions with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, a day before the other parts of the &s;kin; and becomes fuller of pu&s;tules, than any other part of the body.

<P>It might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;welling of the hands, when the face &s;ub&s;ides, at the height of the &s;mall-pox, and of the feet, when the hands &s;ub&s;ide, were governed by &s;ome unknown

a&s;&s;ociations of tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem; but the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of tumor and &s;ub&s;idence more evidently depend on the times of the eruption of the pu&s;tules on tho&s;e parts, as they appear a day &s;ooner on the face than on the hands, and a day &s;ooner on the hands than on the feet, owing to the greater comparative mobility of tho&s;e parts of the &s;kin.</P>

The &s;tomach becomes painful, with indige&s;tion and flatulency, and after a few days an eruption of the face appears, and continues with &s;ome relief, but not with entire relief; as both the pimpled face and indige&s;tion are liable to continue even to old age.</P>

<P N="14">14. <HI>Gutta ro&s;ea hepatica.</HI> The ro&s;y drop of the face of &s;ome drinking people is produced like the gout de&s;cribed below, in con&s;e|quence of an inflamed liver. In the&s;e con&s;titutions the &s;kin of the face being expo&s;ed to greater variation of heat and cold than the membranes of the liver, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more mobility than tho&s;e hepatic membranes; and hence by whatever means the&s;e membranes are in|duced to &s;ympathize, when this &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation occurs, the cu|taneous ve&s;&s;els of the face run into greater degrees of tho&s;e motions, which con&s;titute inflammation, than previou&s;ly exi&s;ted in the mem|branes of the liver; and then tho&s;e motions of the liver cea&s;e.

<P>An inflammation of the liver &s;o frequently attends the great potation of vinous &s;pirit, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that this vi&s;cus it&s;elf becomes inflamed by &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation with the &s;tomach; or that, when one

<P N="15">15. <HI>Podagra.</HI> The gout, except when it affects the liver or &s;tomach, &s;eems always to be a &s;econdary di&s;ea&s;e, and, like the rheu|mati&s;m and ery&s;ipelas mentioned below, begins with the torpor of &s;ome di&s;tant part of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t frequent primary &s;eat of the gout I &s;uppo&s;e to be the liver, which is probably affected with torpor not only previous to the annual paroxy&s;ms of the gout, but to every change of its &s;ituatio$ from one limb to another. The rea&s;ons, which induce me to &s;u&s;pect the liver to be fir&s;t affected, are not only becau&s;e the jaundice &s;ome|times attends the commencement of gout, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XXIV. 2. 8. but a pain al&s;o over the pit of the &s;tomach, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be of the termination of the bile-duct in the duodenum, and which is erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed to be the gout of the &s;tomach, with indi|ge&s;tion and flatulency, generally attends the commencement of th$ inflammation of each limb. See Arthritis ventriculi, Cla&s;s I. 2. 4. 6. In the two ca&s;es, which I &s;aw, of the gout in the limbs being pre|ceded by jaundice, there was a cold &s;hivering fit attended the inflam|mation of the foot, and a pain at the pit of the &s;tomach; which cea&s;ed along with the jaundice, as &s;oon as the foot became inflamed. This led me to &s;u&s;pect, that there was a torpor of the liver, and per|haps of the foot al&s;o, but neverthele&s;s the liver might al&s;o in this ca&s;e be previou&s;ly inflamed, as ob&s;erved in Sect. XXIV. 2. 8.</P>
<P>Now as the membranes of the joints of the feet &s;uffer greater va|riations of heat and cold than the membranes of the liver, and are more habituated to exten&s;ion and contraction than other parts of the &s;kin in their vicinity; I &s;uppo&s;e them to be more mobile, that is, more liable to run into extremes of exertion or quie&s;cence; and are thence more &s;u&s;ceptible of inflammation, than &s;uch parts as are le&s;s

expo&s;ed to great variations of heat and cold, or of exten&s;ion and contraction.</P>
<P>When a &s;tone pre&s;&s;es into the &s;phincter of the bladder, the glans penis is affected with greater pain by &s;ympathy, owing to its greater &s;en&s;ibility, than the &s;phincter of the bladder; and when this pain commences, that of the &s;phincter cea&s;es, when the &s;tone is not too large, or pu&s;hed too far into the urethra. Thus when the membrane, which covers the ball of the great toe, &s;ympathizes with &s;ome mem|branous part of a torpid or inflamed liver; this membrane of the toe falls into that kind of action, whether of torpor or inflammation, with greater energy, than tho&s;e actions excited in the di&s;ea&s;ed liver; and when this new torpor or inflammation commences, that with which it &s;ympathi&s;es cea&s;es; which I believe to be a general law of a&s;&s;ociated inflammations.</P>
<P>The paroxy&s;ms of the gout would &s;eem to be catenated with &s;olar influence, both in re&s;pect to their larger annual periods, and to their diurnal periods&mdash;See Sect. XXXVI. 3. 6&mdash;as the former occur about the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of the year, and the latter commence about an hour before &s;un-ri&s;e; neverthele&s;s the annual periods may depend on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of great vici&s;&s;itudes of cold and heat, and the diurnal ones on our increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility to internal &s;en&s;ations during &s;leep, as in the fits of a&s;thma, and of &s;ome epilep&s;ies. See Sect. XVIII. 15.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the pre-remote cau&s;e or di&s;po&s;ition to the gout, there can be no doubt of its individually ari&s;ing from the potation of fer|mented or &s;pirituous liquors in this country; whether opium pro|duces the &s;ame effect in the countries, where it is in daily u&s;e, I have never been well informed. See Sect. XXI. 10, where this &s;ubject is treated of; to which I have to add, that I have &s;een &s;ome, and heard of others, who have moderated their paroxy&s;ms of gout, by dimini&s;h|ing the quantity of fermented liquors, which they had been accu&s;|tomed to; and others who, by a total ab&s;tinence from fermented

liquors, have entirely freed them&s;elves from this excruciating malady; which otherwi&s;e grows with our years, and curtails or renders mi|&s;er$ble the latter half, or third, of the lives of tho&s;e, who are &s;ubject $o it. The remote cau&s;e is whatever induces temporary torpor or weakne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem; and the proximate cau&s;e is the inirritability, $r defective irritation, of &s;ome part of the &s;y&s;tem; whence torpor a$d con&s;equent inflammation. The great Sydenham &s;aw the bene|$icial effects of the ab&s;tinence from fermented liquors in preventing $he gout, and adds, <Q>&startq;if an empiric could give &s;mall-beer only to gouty patients as a no&s;trum, and per&s;uade them not to drink any other &s;pirituous fluids, that he might re&s;cue thou&s;ands from this di&s;ea&s;e, and acquire a fortune for his ingenuity.&endq;</Q> Yet it is to be lamented, that this accurate ob&s;erver of di&s;ea&s;es had not re&s;olution to practi&s;e his own pre&s;cription, and thus to have &s;et an example to the world of the truth of his doctrine; but, on the contrary, recom|mends Madeira, the &s;tronge&s;t wine in common u&s;e, to be taken in the fits of the gout, to the detriment of thou&s;ands; and is &s;aid him|&s;elf to have peri&s;hed a martyr to the di&s;ea&s;e, which he knew how to &s;ubdue!</P>
<P>As example has more forcible effect than &s;imple a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall now conci&s;ely relate my own ca&s;e, and that of one of my mo&s;t re|&s;pected friends. E. D. was about forty years of age, when he was fir&s;t &s;eized with a fit of the gout. The ball of his right great toe was very painful, and much &s;welled and inflamed, which continued five or &s;ix days in &s;pite of vene&s;ection, a bri&s;k cathartic with ten grains of calomel, and the application of cold air and cold water to his foot. He then cea&s;ed to drink ale or wine alone; confining him|&s;elf to &s;mall beer, or wine diluted with about thrice its quantity of water. In about a year he &s;uffered two other fits of the gout, in le&s;s violent degree. He then totally ab&s;tained from all fermented liquors, not even ta&s;ting &s;mall-beer, or a drop of any kind of wine; but eat plentifully of fle&s;h-meat, and all kinds of vegetables, and fruit, u&s;ing
<PB N="453" REF="4610">
for his drink at meals chiefly water alone, or lemonade, or cream and water; with tea and coffee between them as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>By this ab&s;tinence from fermented liquors he kept quite free from the gout for fifteen or &s;ixteen years; and then began to take &s;mall|beer mixed with water occa&s;ionally, or wine and water, or perry and water, or cyder and water; by which indulgence after a few months he had again a paroxy&s;m of gout, which continued about three days in the ball of his toe; which occa&s;ioned him to return to his habit of drinking water, and has now for above twenty years kept in perpetual health, except accidental colds from the changes of the &s;ea&s;ons. Before he ab&s;tained from fermented or &s;pirituous li|quors, he was frequently &s;ubject to the piles, and to the gravel, nei|ther of which he has &s;ince experienced.</P>
<P>In the following ca&s;e the gout was e&s;tabli&s;hed by longer habit and greater violence, and therefore required more cautious treatment. The Rev. R. W. was &s;eized with the gout about the age of thirty|two, which increa&s;ed &s;o rapidly that at the age of forty-one he was confined to his room &s;even months in that year; he had &s;ome degree of lamene&s;s during the intervals, with chalky &s;wellings of his heels and elbows. As the di&s;ea&s;e had continued &s;o long and &s;o violently, and the powers of his dige&s;tion were &s;omewhat weakened, he was advi&s;ed not entirely to leave off all fermented liquors; and as &s;mall|beer is of &s;uch various &s;trength, he was advi&s;ed to drink exactly two wine gla&s;&s;es, about four ounces, of wine mixed with three or four times its quantity of water, with or without lemon and &s;ugar, for his daily potation at dinner, and no other fermented liquor of any kind; and was advi&s;ed to eat fle&s;h-meat with any kind of boiled vegetables, and fruit, with or without &s;pice. He has now &s;crupulou&s;ly con|tinued this regimen for above five years, and has had an annual mo|derate gouty paroxy&s;m of a few weeks, in&s;tead of the confinement of &s;o many months, with great health and good &s;pirits during the intervals.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="4620">
The following is a more particular account of the hi&s;tory of this ca&s;e; being part of a letter which Mr. Wilmot wrote on that &s;ub|ject at my entreaty.</P>
<P>"I entered into the army with an excellent con&s;titution at the age of fifteen. The corps I &s;erved in was di&s;tingui&s;hed by its regu|larity, that is, the regular allowance of the me&s;s was only one pint of wine per man each day; unle&s;s we had company to dine with us; then, as was the general cu&s;tom of the time, the bottle circulated without limit. This mode of living, though by no means con&s;idered as exce&s;s for men, was certainly too great for a youth of my age. This &s;tyle of living I continued, when with the regiment, till the latter end of the year 1769, when I had the misfortune to &s;leep in a damp bed at Sheffield on a journey to York, but arrived there before I felt the ill effects of it. I was then &s;eized with a violent inflam|matory rheumati&s;m with great inflammation of my eyes, and was attended by Dr. Dealtry; &s;o violent was the di&s;order, that I was bled for it eight times in le&s;s than a fortnight; and was three months, before I could con&s;ider my health perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. Dr. Dealtry told me, that I &s;hould be &s;ubject to &s;imilar attacks for many years; and that he had no doubt, from the tendency he found in my habit to inflammation, that, when I was farther advanced in life, I &s;hould change that complaint for the gout. He predicted truly; for the three &s;ucceeding winters I had the &s;ame complaint, but not &s;o vio|lently; the fourth winter I e&s;caped, and imputed my e&s;cape to the continuance of cold bathing during the whole of that winter; after that I never e&s;caped it, till I had a regular and &s;evere &s;it of the gout: after the fir&s;t attack of rheumatic fever I was more ab&s;temious in my manner of living, though when in company I never &s;ubjected my&s;elf to any great re&s;traint. In the year 1774 I had quitted the army, and being in a more retired &s;ituation, was &s;eldom led into any exce&s;s; in 1776 and 1777 I was in the habit of drinking a good deal of wine very frequently, though not con&s;tantly. After that period till the
<PB N="455" REF="4630">
year 1781, I drank a larger quantity of wine regularly, but very &s;el|dom to any degree of intoxication. I lived much at that time in the &s;ociety of &s;ome gentlemen, who u&s;ually drank nearly a bottle of wine daily after dinner. I mu&s;t here however ob&s;erve, that at no part of my life was I accu&s;tomed to drink wine in an evening, and very &s;el|dom drank any thing more than a &s;ingle half-pint gla&s;s of &s;ome &s;ort of &s;pirits diluted with much water. Till the year 1781 I had always been accu&s;tomed to u&s;e very violent and continued exerci&s;e on hor&s;e|back; in the winter months I pur&s;ued all field diver&s;ions, and in the &s;ummer months I rode frequent and long journeys; and with this exerci&s;e was liable to per&s;pire to great exce&s;s; be&s;ides which I was &s;ubject to very profu&s;e night-&s;weats, and had frequently boils break out all over me, e&s;pecially in the &s;pring and autumn; for which I took no medicine, except a little flour of &s;ulphur with cream of tartar in honey.</P>
<P>"You will ob&s;erve I bring every thing down to the date of 1781. In the month of October in that year, when I was ju&s;t entered into the thirty-&s;econd year of my age, I had the fir&s;t attack of gout; that fit was very &s;evere, and of many weeks continuance. I now deter|mined upon a more ab&s;temious method of living, in re&s;pect to wine; and indeed the &s;ociety, in which I had before been accu&s;tomed to live, being con&s;iderably changed, I had le&s;s frequent temptations to exce&s;s. From this time I enjoyed the mo&s;t perfect good &s;tate of health till Augu&s;t 1784, when I had my &s;econd attack of gout. I never perfectly recovered from this attack through the &s;ucceeding winter, and in March 1785 was advi&s;ed to try the Bath waters, and drank them under the direction of one of the faculty of that place. I was there &s;oon &s;eized with a fever, and a &s;light attack of gout in one knee. I &s;hould ob&s;erve, that when I &s;et out from home, I was in a weak and low &s;tate, and unequal to much fatigue; as appeared by my having a fainting fit one day on the road, after having tra|velled only about fifty miles; in the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer I had two
<PB N="456" REF="4640">
or three more &s;light attacks of gout of le&s;s con&s;equence, till the month of October; when I was afflicted with it all over me in &s;uch a manner, as to be without the po&s;&s;ibility of the lea&s;t degree of re|moval for &s;ome days; and was about two months without being able to get into the air. This was the &s;evere&s;t attack I had then expe|rienced; though I have &s;ince had &s;everal equally &s;evere. In the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer I had a fall with my hor&s;e; and &s;oon after it, having di&s;covered an enlargement on one elbow, I concluded I had hurt it at that time; but in the cour&s;e of this la&s;t attack having a &s;imilar enlargement on the other elbow, I found my mi&s;take, and that they were collections of gouty matter; the&s;e increa&s;ed to the &s;ize of pullet's eggs, and continue in that &s;tate. I had &s;oon after &s;imilar enlargements on my heels; the right heel being &s;everely brui&s;ed, I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of having it lanced, and a large quantity of chalky matter was di&s;charged from it; and have &s;ince that time frequently had chalky matter taken from it, and &s;ometimes &s;mall bits of apparently perfect chalk. My right hand &s;oon was afflicted in the &s;ame way, and I have &s;carcely a joint on tho&s;e fingers now in a natural &s;tate. My left hand has e&s;caped tolerably well. After this la&s;t attack (viz. October 1785), I had two or three &s;light attacks before the month of June 1787, when I had a very &s;evere intermittent fever; from that time I continued very well till the latter end of the year, when I began to feel the gout about me very much, but was not confined by it. I was in this &s;tate advi&s;ed to try what is called the American Recipe (gum guaiacum and nitre di&s;|&s;olved in &s;pirits); it had apparently been of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to a friend of mine, who from the inability to walk a mile for &s;ome years, was believed to be re&s;tored by the u&s;e of this medicine to a good &s;tate of health, &s;o as to walk ten miles a day. In addition to this medicine I drank, as my common beverage with my meals, &s;pruce beer. I had &s;o high an opinion of this medicine in the go$t, and of &s;pruce be$r as an anti&s;corbutic, that I contemplated with much &s;atisfaction, and
<PB N="457" REF="4650">
with very little doubt, the perfect re&s;toration of my health and &s;trength; but I was mi&s;erably deceived; for in September 1788 I was &s;eized with the gout in a degree that none but arthritics, and indeed but few of tho&s;e, can ea&s;ily conceive. From this time till Augu&s;t 1789 I &s;carcely ever pa&s;&s;ed a comfortable day; &s;even months of this time I had been confined, my health &s;eemed much impaired, my &s;trength was dimini&s;hed, and my appetite almo&s;t gone. In this &s;tate my friends pre&s;&s;ed me to con&s;ult you. I was unwilling for &s;ome time to do it, as I had lo&s;t all hope of relief; however, when I had determined to apply to you, I likewi&s;e determined to give up every prejudice of my own re&s;pecting my ca&s;e, and to adhere mo&s;t &s;trictly to your advice. On the 20th of Augu&s;t 1789 I con&s;ulted you, on the 25th I entered upon the regimen, which you pre&s;cribed, and which was as follows.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Drink no malt liquor on any account. Let your beverage at dinner con&s;i&s;t of two gla&s;&s;es of wine diluted with three half-pints of water. On no account drink any more wine or &s;pirituous liquors in the cour&s;e of the day; but, if you want more liquid, take cream and water, or milk and water, or lemonade, with tea, coffee, chocolate. U&s;e the warm bath twice a week for half an hour before going to bed, at the degree of heat which is mo&s;t grateful to your &s;en&s;ations. Eat meat con&s;tantly at dinner, and with it any kind of tender vegetables you plea&s;e. Keep the body open by two evacuations daily, if po&s;&s;ible without medicine, if not take the &s;ize of a nutmeg of lenitive electuary occa&s;ionally, or $iv$ grains of rhubarb every night. U&s;e no violent exerci&s;e, which may &s;ubject your&s;elf to &s;udden changes from heat to cold; but as much moderate exerci&s;e as may be, without being much fatigued or &s;tarved with cold. Take &s;ome &s;upper every night; a &s;mall quantity of animal food is pre&s;erred; but if your palate refu&s;es this, take vegetable food, as fruit pie, or milk; &s;omething &s;hould be eaten, as it might be injurious to you to fa&s;t too long.&endq;</Q> To
<PB N="458" REF="4660">
the whole of this I adhered mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly, and &s;oon found my appetite improve, and with it my &s;trength and &s;pirits. I had in December a &s;evere attack, and two or three &s;light ones in the cour&s;e of twelve months; but the improvement in the general &s;tate of my health induced me to per&s;evere. On the 18th of Augu&s;t 1790 I had another &s;evere attack, but it went off ea&s;ier than before, and I &s;oon recovered &s;ufficiently to go to Buxton, which you advi&s;ed me to, and from which I reaped great benefit; neverthele&s;s on the 29th of December I had a &s;light attack in compari&s;on of &s;ome that I had be|fore experienced, and from that time I was free from gout, and en|joyed my health perfectly well till the fourth week in October 1791; from that till the third week in October 1792; from that till the third week in October 1793; and from that till June 1794. From what happened for the la&s;t three years I dreaded the month of Octo|ber; but I e&s;caped then, and have enjoyed my health mo&s;t perfectly ever &s;ince till within the la&s;t week, that I have had a &s;light attack in one knee, which is nearly gone, without any &s;ymptom to lead me to &s;uppo&s;e that it will go further.</P>
<P>"I adhered to your advice mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly for the fir&s;t year; and in regard to the not drinking malt liquor, and taking only the two gla&s;&s;es of wine with water, I have never deviated but two days; and then the fir&s;t day I only drank one gla&s;s of ale and one gla&s;s of Champaigne; on the &s;econd only one gla&s;s of Champaigne. With regard to the warm bath, I only u&s;e it now when I have gouty &s;ymptoms upon me, and in &s;uch &s;ituations I find it of infinite &s;er|vice; and in other re&s;pects I continue to live according to your direction.</P>
<P>"Many per&s;ons have laughed at the idea of my per&s;everance in a &s;y&s;tem, which has not been able to <HI>cure</HI> the gout after five years trial; but &s;uch per&s;ons are either ignorant of what I before &s;uff$$$d, or totally unacquainted with the nature of the di&s;order.

<P>There are &s;ituations neverthele&s;s in which a paroxy&s;m of gout has been believed to be de&s;irable, as relieving the patient from other di&s;agreeable di&s;ea&s;es, or debilities, or &s;en&s;ations. Thus when the liver is torpid, a perpetual unea&s;ine&s;s and depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits occur; which a fit of gout is &s;uppo&s;ed to cure by a meta&s;ta&s;is of the di&s;ea&s;e. Others have acquired epileptic fits, probably from the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation of a chronically inflamed liver; which they &s;uppo&s;e the pain and inflammation of gout would relieve. When gouty patients become much debilitated by the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, they are liable to drop&s;y of the che&s;t, which they &s;uppo&s;e a fit of the gout would relieve. But in all the&s;e ca&s;es the attempt to procure a pa|roxy&s;m of gout by wine, or aromatics, or volatiles, or bli&s;ters, or mineral waters, &s;eldom &s;ucceeds; and the patients are obliged to ap|ply to other methods of relief adapted to their particular ca&s;es. In the two former &s;ituations &s;mall repeated do&s;es of calomel, or mer|curial unction on the region of the liver may &s;ucceed, by giving new activity to the ve&s;&s;els of the liver, either to &s;ecrete or to ab&s;orb their adapted fluids, and thus to remove the cau&s;e of the gout, rather than to promote a fit of it. In the la&s;t ca&s;e the tincture of digitalis, and afterwards the cla&s;s of &s;orbentia, mu&s;t be applied to.</P>
<P>M. M. In young &s;trong patients the gout &s;hould be cured by vene&s;ection and cathartics and diluents, with poultices externally. But it has a natural cri&s;is by producing calcarcous matter on the in|flamed membrane, and therefore in old en&s;eebled people it is &s;afe&s;t to
<PB N="460" REF="4680">
wait for this cri&s;is, attending to the natural evacuations and the de|gree of fever; and in young ones, where it is not attended with much fever, it is cu&s;tomary and popular not to bleed, but only to keep the body open with aloes, to u&s;e gentle &s;udorifics, as neutral &s;alts, and to give the bark at the decline of the fit; which is parti|cularly u&s;eful where the patient is much debilitated. See Arthritis ven|triculi, Cla&s;s I. 2. 4. 6. and Sect. XXV. 17.</P>
<P>When there is not much fever, and the patient is debilitated with age, or the continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e, a moderate opiate, as twenty drops of tincture of opium, or one grain of &s;olid opium, may be taken every night with advantage. Externally a pa&s;te made with double the quantity of yea&s;t is a good poultice; and booterkins made with oiled &s;ilk, as they confine the per&s;pirable matter, keep the part moi&s;t and &s;upple, and thence relieve the pain like poultices.</P>
<P>The only &s;afe way of moderating the di&s;ea&s;e is by an uniform and equal diminution, or a total ab&s;tinence from fermented liquors, with the cautions directed in Sect. XII. 7. 8. The continued u&s;e of &s;trong bitters, as of Portland's powder, or bark, has been frequently inju|rious, as &s;poken of in the Materia Medica, Art. IV. 2. 11.</P>
<P>One of my acquaintance, who was much afflicted with the gout, ab&s;tained for about half a year from beer and wine; and not having re&s;olution to per&s;i&s;t, returned to his former habits of potation in le&s;s quantity; and ob&s;erved that he was then for one winter &s;tronger and freer from the gout than u&s;ual. This however did not long con|tinue, as the di&s;ea&s;e afterwards returned with its u&s;ual or increa&s;ed violence. This I think is a circum&s;tance not unlikely to occur, as opium has a greater effect after its u&s;e has been a while intermitted; and the debility or torpor, which is the cau&s;e of gout, is thus for a few months prevented by the greater irritability of the &s;y&s;tem, ac|quired during the le&s;&s;ened u&s;e of fermented liquor.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on an ounce of &s;pirituous tincture of guaiacum, or of bark, is &s;aid to have for &s;ome time prevented returns of the gout;
<PB N="461" REF="4690">
which has afterwards, like all other great &s;timuli when long con|tinued, been &s;ucceeded by greater debility, and de&s;troyed the patient. This &s;eems to have been exemplified in the ca&s;e of the ingenious Dr. Bown, &s;ee Preface to his Elementa Medicinae; he found tem|porary relief from the &s;timulus of wine, regardle&s;s of its future effects.</P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>Rheumati&s;mus.</HI> Acute rheumati&s;m. There is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that rheumatic inflammations, like the gouty ones, are not a primary di&s;ea&s;e; but that they are the con&s;equence of a tran&s;lation of morbid action from one part of the &s;y&s;tem to another. This idea is countenanced by the frequent change of place of rheumatic-like gouty inflammations, and from their attacking two &s;imilar parts at the &s;ame time, as both ankles a$d both wri&s;ts, and the&s;e attacks being in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to each other. Whereas it is not probable that both feet or both hands &s;hould at the &s;ame time be equally expo&s;ed to any external cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, as to cold or moi&s;ture; and le&s;s &s;o that the&s;e &s;hould occur in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. La&s;tly, from the inflamma|tory diathe&s;is in this di&s;ea&s;e being more difficult to &s;ubdue, and more dangerous in event, than other common inflammations, e&s;pecially to pregnant women, and in weak con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>From this idea of the rheumati&s;m being not a primary di&s;ea&s;e, like the gout, but a transferred morbid action owing to the previous tor|por of &s;ome other part of the &s;y&s;tem, we perceive why it attacks weak people with greater pertinacity than &s;trong ones; re&s;i&s;ting or recurring again and again after frequent evacuatio$s, in a manner very different from primary inflammations; becau&s;e the cau&s;e is not removed, which is at a di&s;tance from the &s;eat of the inflam|mation.</P>
<P>This al&s;o accounts for rheumatic inflammations &s;o very rarely ter|minating in &s;uppuration, becau&s;e like the gout the original cau&s;e is not in the inflamed part, and therefore does not continue to act after
<PB N="462" REF="4700">
the inflammation commences. In&s;tead of &s;uppuration in this di&s;ea&s;e, as well as in the gout, a quantity of mucus or coagulable lymph is formed on the inflamed membrane; which in the gout changes into chalk&s;tones, and in the rheumati&s;m is either reab&s;orbed, or lies on the membrane, producing pains on motion long after the termina|tion of the inflammation, which pains are called chronic rheumati&s;m. The membranes, which have thus been once or repeatedly inflamed, become le&s;s mobile, or le&s;s liable to be affected by &s;ympathy, as ap|pears by the gout affecting new parts, when the joints of the foot have been frequently inflamed by it; hence as the cau&s;e of the inflam|mation does not exi&s;t in the inflamed part, and as this part becomes le&s;s liable to future attacks, it &s;eldom &s;uppurates.</P>
<P>Secondly, when rheumati&s;m affects the mu&s;cles of the che&s;t, it produces &s;ymptoms &s;imilar to pleuri&s;y, but are di&s;tingui&s;hed from that by the patient having previou&s;ly &s;uffered rheumatic affections in other parts, and by the pertinacity or continuance of the inflam|matory &s;tate of the patient, this &s;hould be termed pleurodyne rheu|matica.</P>
<P>Thirdly, when rheumatic inflammation affects the bowels, it pro|duces a di&s;ea&s;e very different from enteritis, or common inflammation of the bowels, and &s;hould be termed enteralgia rheumatica. The pain is le&s;s than in enteritis, and the di&s;ea&s;e of longer continuance, with harder pul&s;e, and the blood equally &s;izy. It is attended with frequent dejections, with much mucus, and previous griping pains, but without vomiting; and differs perhaps from dy&s;entery from its not being attended with bloody &s;tools, and not being infectious.</P>
<P>Fourthly, there is another kind of rheumati&s;m attended with de|bility, which &s;uppurates, and &s;hould be termed rheumati&s;mus &s;up|purans. It is generally believed to be the gout, till &s;uppuration takes place on the &s;welled joint; and, as the patient &s;inks, there are &s;loughs formed over the whole mouth; and he &s;eems to be de&s;troyed by inflammation or gangrene of the mucous membranes. I have
<PB N="463" REF="4710">
twice &s;een this di&s;ea&s;e in patients about &s;ixty. Some other di&s;ea&s;es are erroneou&s;ly called rheumatic, as hemicrania, and odontalgia. See Sect. XXVI. 3.</P>
<P>M. M. In the three former kinds vene&s;ection repeatedly. Cathar|tics. Antimonials. Diluents. Neutral &s;alts. Oil. Warm bath. Afterwards the bark. Opium with or without ipecacuanha; but not till the patient is con&s;iderably weakened. Sweats forced early in the di&s;ea&s;e do injury. Opium given early in the di&s;ea&s;e prolongs it. In the la&s;t kind, gentle &s;timulants, as wine and water, mucilage, &s;or|bentia.</P>
<P>The following is a ca&s;e of &s;uppurative rheumati&s;m. Mr. F&mdash;, about &s;ixty, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have the gout in his hand, which how|ever &s;uppurated, and it was then called the &s;uppurative rheumati&s;m. He had lived rather intemperately in re&s;pect to wine, and was now afflicted with a tendency to inflammation of the mucous membranes. As he lay on the bed half re&s;upine, propped up with pillows, and al&s;o &s;lept in that po&s;ture, his lower jaw dropped by its own weight, when the voluntary power of the mu&s;cles was &s;u&s;pended. The mucus of his mouth and throat became quite dry, and at length was &s;ucceeded with &s;loughs; this was a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tance to him, and was in vain endeavoured to be relieved by &s;upporting his jaw by &s;lender &s;teel &s;prings fixed to his night-cap, and by &s;prings of ela&s;tic gum. The &s;loughs &s;pread and &s;eemed to accelerate his death. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 2.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>Ery&s;ipelas.</HI> The ery&s;ipelas differs from the zona ignea, and other &s;pecies of herpes, in its being attended with fever, which is &s;ometimes of the &s;en&s;itive irritated or inflammatory kind, with &s;trong and full pul&s;e; and at other times with weak pul&s;e and great inirritabi|lity, as when it precedes or attends mortifications. See Cla&s;s II. $. 3. 2.</P>
<P>Like the zona ignea above de&s;cribed, it &s;eems to be a &s;econdary di&s;|ea&s;e, having for its primary part the torpor or inflammation of &s;ome
<PB N="464" REF="4720">
internal or di&s;tant membrane, as appears from its &s;o frequently attend|ing wounds; &s;ometimes &s;preading from i&s;&s;ues over the whole limb, or back, by &s;ympathy with a tendon or membrane, which is &s;timulated by the pea&s;e in them. In its more violent degree I &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;ympathizes with &s;ome exten&s;ive internal membranes, as of the liver, &s;tomach, or brain. Another rea&s;on, which countenances this idea, is, that the inflammation gradually changes its &s;ituation, one part healing as another inflames; as happens in re&s;pect to more di&s;tant parts in gout and rheumati&s;m; and which &s;eems to &s;hew, that the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e is not in the &s;ame place with the inflammation. And thirdly, becau&s;e the ery&s;ipelas of the face and head is liable to affect the membranes of the brain; which were probably in the&s;e ca&s;es the original or primary &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e; and la&s;tly, becau&s;e the fits of ery&s;ipelas, like tho&s;e of the gout, are liable to return at certain an|nual or monthly periods, as further treated of in Cla&s;s II. 1. 3. 2.</P>
<P>Many ca&s;es of ery&s;ipelas from wounds or brui&s;es are related in De|$ault's Surgical Journal, Vol. II. in which poultices are &s;aid to do great injury, as well as oily or fatty applications. Saturnine &s;olutions were &s;ometimes u&s;ed with advantage. A grain of emetic tartar given to clear the &s;tomach and bowels, is &s;aid to be of great &s;ervice.</P>
<P N="18">18. <HI>Te&s;tium tumor in gonorrhoea.</HI> Mr. Hunter in his Treati&s;e on the Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e ob&s;erves, that the tumor of the te&s;tes in gonor|rhoea ari&s;es from their &s;ympathy with the inflammation of the urethra; and that they are not &s;imilar to the actions ari&s;ing from the applica|tion of venereal matter, whether by ab&s;orption or otherwi&s;e; as they &s;eldom or never &s;uppurate; and when &s;uppuration happens, the mat|t$r produced is not venereal.

In wo|men a &s;welling of the brea&s;ts often &s;ucceeds the decline of the mumps by another wonderful &s;ympathy. See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 2. 7. and I. 1. 2. 15. In many per&s;ons a delirium &s;ucceeds the &s;welling of the parotis, or the &s;ub&s;equent ones of the te&s;tes or brea&s;ts; which is &s;ometimes fatal, and &s;eems to ari&s;e from a &s;ympathy of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive action, and not of &s;ynchronous action, of the membranes of the brain with tho&s;e of the parotide glands. Sometimes a &s;tupor comes on in&s;tead of this deli|rium, which is relieved by fomenting the &s;haved head for an hour or two. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 3. 4.</P>

Hunter to re&s;i&s;t the freezing proce&s;s in their living &s;tate more powerfully, than when they were killed by having the yolk and white &s;hook together. Philo&s;. Tran&s;. It may be a&s;ked, does the heat during the incubation of eggs act as a &s;timulus exciting the living principle into activity? Or does it act &s;imply as a cau&s;a &s;ine qu&acirc; non, as an influence, which penetrating the ma&s;s, removes the particles of it to a greater di&s;tance from each other, &s;o as to allow their movement over each other, in the &s;ame manner as heat is conceived to produce the fluidity of water; not by &s;timulus, but by its penetrating influ|ence? Or may elementary heat in its uncombined &s;tate be &s;uppo&s;ed to act only as an influence nece&s;&s;ary to life in its natural quantity; whence torpor and death follows the education of it from the body; but in its increa&s;ed &s;tate above what is natural, or u&s;ual, that it acts as a &s;timulus; which w$ have a &s;en&s;e to perceive; and which excites many parts of the &s;y$$em into unnatural action?

it mu&s;t differ very much from that &s;tate of animal life, &s;ince not only all voluntary power is &s;u&s;pended, but &s;en&s;ation and va&s;cular mo|tion has cea&s;ed, and can only be re&s;tored by the influence of heat. There have been related in&s;tances of &s;nails, which have recovered life and motion on being put into water after having experienced many years of torpidity, or apparent death, in the cabinets of the curious. Here the water as well as the heat are required not only as a &s;timulus, but as a cau&s;a &s;ine qu&acirc; non of fluidity and motion, and con&s;equent life.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Pullulatio arborum.</HI> The annual revive&s;cence of the buds of trees &s;eems not only to be owing to the influence of the returning warmth of the &s;pring, but al&s;o to be catenated with &s;olar gravitation; becau&s;e &s;eeds and roots and buds, which are analogous to the eggs of animals, put forth their &s;hoots by a le&s;s quantity of heat in &s;pring, than they had undergone in the latter part of autumn, which may however be a&s;cribed to their previous torpid &s;tate, and con&s;equent ac|cumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, or irritability; as explained in Botanic Garden, Part II. Cant. I. l. 322. note. Other circum&s;tances, which countenance the idea, that vegetation is affected by &s;olar gravitation, as well as by heat, may be ob&s;erved in the ripening of the &s;eeds of plants both in tho&s;e countries where the &s;ummers are &s;hort, and in tho&s;e where they are long.

<P N="4">4. <HI>Orga&s;matis venerei periodus.</HI> The venereal orga&s;m of birds and quadrupeds commences or returns about the vernal or autumnal equi|noxes, and thence &s;eems in re&s;pect to their great periods to be go|verned by &s;olar influence.

mares and bitches in this re&s;pect re&s;embling the female catamenia. See Sect. XXXVI. 2. 3. and Sect. XVI. 13.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Brachii concu&s;&s;io electrica.</HI> The movement of the arm, even of a paralytic patient, when an electric &s;hock is pa&s;&s;ed through it, is owing to the &s;timulus of the exce&s;s of electricity. When a piece of zinc and &s;ilver, each about the &s;ize of a crown-piece, are placed one under the upper lip, and the other on the tongue, &s;o as the outer edges may be brought into contact, there is an appearance of light in the eyes, as often as the outer edges of the&s;e metals are brought into contact or &s;eparated; which is another in&s;tance of the &s;timulus of the pa&s;&s;age of electric &s;hocks through the fibres of the organs of &s;en&s;e, as well as through the mu&s;cular fibres. See Sect. XII. 1. 1. and fir&s;t addit. note to Vol. I. of this work. But in its natural &s;tate electricity &s;eems only to act as an influence on animal and vegetable bodies; of the &s;alutary or injurious effects of which we have yet no preci&s;e knowledge.</P>
<P>Yet if regular journals were kept of the variations of atmo&s;pheric electricity, it is probable &s;ome di&s;coveries of its influence on our &s;y&s;|tem might in time be di&s;covered. For this purpo&s;e a machine on the principle of Mr. Bennet's electric doubler might be applied to the pen|dulum of a clock, &s;o as to manife&s;t, and even to record the daily or hourly variations of aerial electricity. Which has already been exe|cuted, and applied to the pendulum of a Dutch wooden clock, by Mr. Bennet, c$rate of Wirk&s;worth in Derby&s;hire.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the variations of the degree or kind of atmo&s;pheric electri|city, &s;ome animals, and &s;ome men, &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater power of accumulating this fluid in them$$lves than others. Of which a fa|mous hi&s;tory of a Ru&s;&s;ian prince was lately publi&s;hed; who, during the clear and &s;evere fro&s;ts of that country, could not move him&s;elf in bed without luminous corru&s;cations. Such may have been the ca&s;e of tho&s;e people, who have been related to have taken fire &s;pontaneou&s;ly,
<PB N="472" REF="4800">
and to have been reduced to a&s;hes. The electric concu&s;&s;ion from the gymnotus electricus, and torpedo, are other in&s;tances of the power of the animal &s;y&s;tem to accumulate electricity, as in the&s;e it is u&s;ed as a weapon of defence, or for the purpo&s;e of taking their prey.</P>
<P>Some have believed that the accumulation or pa&s;&s;age of the magne|tic fluid might affect the animal &s;y&s;tem, and have a&s;&s;erted that the application of a large magnet to an aching tooth has quickly effected a cure. If this experiment is again tried in odontalgia, or hemicrania, the painful membrane of the tooth or head &s;hould be included between the &s;outh and north poles of a hor&s;e-&s;hoe magnet, or between the contrary poles of two different magnets, that the magneti&s;m may be accumulated on the torpid part.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Oxygenatio &s;anguinis.</HI> The variation of the quantity of oxygen gas exi&s;ting in the atmo&s;phere mu&s;t affect all breathing animals; in its exce&s;s this too mu&s;t be e&s;teemed a &s;timulus; but in its natural quantity would &s;eem to act as an influence, or cau&s;e, without which animal life cannot exi&s;t even a minute. It is hoped that Dr. Beddoes's plan for a pneumatic infirmary, for the purpo&s;e of putting this and various other airs to the te&s;t of experiment, will meet with public en|couragement, and render con&s;umption, a&s;thma, cancer, and many di&s;ea&s;es conquerable, which at pre&s;ent prey with unremitted deva&s;ta|tion on all orders and ages of mankind.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Humectatio corporis.</HI> Water, and probably the vapour of water di&s;&s;olved or diffu&s;ed in the atmo&s;phere, unites by mechanical attraction with the unorganized cuticle, and &s;oftens and enlarges it; as may be &s;een in the loo&s;e and wrinkled &s;kin of the hands of wa&s;herwomen; the &s;ame probably occurs to the mucous membrane of the lungs in moi&s;t weather; and by thickening it increa&s;es the difficulty of re&s;piration of &s;ome people, who are &s;aid to be a&s;thmatical. So far water may be &s;aid to act as an influx or influence, but when it is taken up by the
<PB N="473" REF="4810">
mouths of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, it mu&s;t excite tho&s;e mouths into ac|tion, and then acts as a &s;timulus.</P>
<P>There appears from hence to be four methods by which animal bodies are penetrated by external things. 1. By their &s;timulus, which induces the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els to imbibe them. 2. By mechanical at|traction, as when water &s;oftens the cuticle. 3. By chemical attrac|tion, as when oxygen pa&s;&s;es through the membranes of the air-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, and combines with the blood. And la&s;tly, by influx without mechanical attraction, chemical combination, or animal ab|&s;orption, as the univer&s;al fluids of heat, gravitation, electricity, mag|neti&s;m, and perhaps of other ethereal fluids yet unknown.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Catenated with Irritative Motions.</HEAD>
<P>As irritative mu&s;cular motions are attended with pain, when they are exerted too weakly, as well as when they are exerted too &s;trongly; &s;o irritative ideas become attended with &s;en&s;ation, when they are ex|erted too weakly, as well as when they are exerted too &s;trongly. Which accounts for the&s;e ideas being attended with &s;en&s;ation in the various kinds of vertigo de&s;cribed below.</P>
<P>There is great difficulty in tracing the immediate cau&s;e of the de|ficiences of action of &s;ome links of the a&s;&s;ociations of irritative mo|tions; fir&s;t, becau&s;e the trains and tribes of motions, which compo&s;e the&s;e links, are &s;o widely extended as to embrace almo&s;t the whole animal &s;y&s;tem; and &s;econdly, becau&s;e when the fir&s;t link of an a&s;&s;o|ciated train of actions is exerted with too great energy, the &s;econd link by rever&s;e &s;ympathy may be affected with torpor. And then this &s;econd link may tran&s;mit, as it were, this torpor to a third link, and at the &s;ame time regain its own energy of action; and it is po&s;&s;ible this third link may in like manner tran&s;mit its torpor to a fourth, and thus regain its own natural quantity of motion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to explain this by an example taken from &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociated motions, as the origin of their di&s;turbed actions is more ea&s;ily detected. This morning I &s;aw an elderly per&s;on, who had gradually lo&s;t all the teeth in his upper jaw, and all of the under ex|cept three of the molares; the la&s;t of the&s;e was now loo&s;e, and occa&s;ionally
<PB N="475" REF="4830">
painful; the fangs of which were almo&s;t naked, the gums being much wa&s;ted both within and without the jaw. He is a man of attentive ob&s;ervation, and a&s;&s;ured me, that he had again and again noticed, that, when a pain commenced in the membranes of the al|veolar pro$$$$ of the upper jaw oppo&s;ite to the loo&s;e tooth in the under one (which had frequently occurred for &s;everal days pa&s;t), the pain of the loo&s;e tooth cea&s;ed. And that, when the pain afterwards extend|ed to the ear and temple on that &s;ide, the pain in the membranes of the upper jaw cea&s;ed. In this ca&s;e the membranes of the alveolar proce&s;s of the upper jaw became torpid, and con&s;equently painful, by their rever&s;e &s;ympathy with the too violent actions of the inflamed membranes of the loo&s;e tooth; and then by a &s;econdary &s;ympathy the membranes about the ear and temple became torpid, and painful; and tho&s;e of the alveolar proce&s;s of the upper jaw regained their natural quantity of action, and cea&s;ed to be painful. A great many more nice and attentive ob&s;ervations are wanted to elucidate the&s;e curious circum&s;tances of a&s;&s;ociation, which will be found to be of the greate&s;t importance in the cure of many di&s;ea&s;es, and lead us to the knowledge of fever.</P>

In this ca&s;e the mouths of the cutaneous lymphatics be|come torpid by the &s;ubduction of their accu&s;tomed degree of heat, and tho&s;e of the bladder and inte&s;tines become torpid by direct &s;ympathy; whence le&s;s of the thinner part of the urinary &s;ecretion, and of the mucus of the inte&s;tines, is reab&s;orbed. See Sect. XXIX. 4. 6. This effect of &s;uddenly cooling the &s;kin by the a&s;per&s;ion of cold water has been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in co&s;tivene&s;s, and has produced evacuations, when other means have failed.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Dy&s;pnoea a balneo frigido.</HI> The difficulty of breathing on going up to the middle in cold water is owing to the irritative a&s;&s;ociation or catenation of the action of the extreme ve&s;&s;els of the lungs with tho&s;e of the &s;kin. So that when the latter are rendered torpid or inactive by the application of &s;udden cold, the former become inactive at the &s;ame time, and retard the circulation of the blood through the lungs, for this difficulty of breathing cannot be owing to the pre&s;&s;ure of the water impeding the circulation downwards, as it happens equally by a cold &s;hower-bath, and is &s;oon conquered by habitual immer&s;ions. The capillaries of the &s;kin are rendered torpid by the &s;ubduction of the &s;timulus of heat, and by the con&s;equent diminution of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation. The capillaries of the lungs are rendered torpid by the diminution of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which is now excited in le&s;s quantity by the le&s;&s;ened actions of the capillaries of the &s;kin, with which they are catenated. So that at this time both the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries are principally actuated, as far as they have any action, by the &s;timu$us of the blood. But in a &s;hort time the &s;en&s;orial powers of irritation, and of a&s;&s;ociation, become ac|cumulated, and very energetic action of both the&s;e membranes &s;uc|ceed. Which thus re&s;emble the cold and hot fit of an intermittent fever.</P>

The irritative motions of the &s;tomach become torpid, and do their office of dige&s;tion imperfectly, in con&s;equence of their a&s;&s;ociation with the torpid motions of the ve&s;|&s;els of the extremities. Fear, as it produces palene&s;s and torpidity of the &s;kin, frequently occa&s;ions temporary indige&s;tion in con&s;equence of this a&s;&s;ociation of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach; as riding in very bad roads will give flatulency and indige&s;tion to ti|morous people.</P>
<P>A &s;hort expo&s;ure to cold air increa&s;es dige&s;tion, which is then owing to the rever&s;e &s;ympathy between the capillary ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, and of the &s;tomach. Hence when the body is expo&s;ed to cold air, within certain limits of time and quantity of cold, a rever&s;e &s;ympathy of the &s;tomach and the &s;kin fir&s;t occurs, and afterwards a direct &s;ympathy. In the former ca&s;e the expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power by the &s;kin being le&s;&s;ened, but not its production in the brain; the &s;econd link of the a&s;&s;ociation, viz. the &s;tomach, acquires a greater &s;hare of it.

<P>As no fever attended this violent cough, and but little expectora|tion, and that of a thin and fro$hy kind, I &s;u&s;pected the membrane of the lungs to be rather torpid than inflamed, and that the &s;aline part of the mucus not being ab&s;orbed &s;timulated them into perpetual exertion And la$tly, that though the lungs are not &s;en&s;ible to cold and heat, and probably therefore le&s;s mobile; yet, as they are never|thele&s;s liable to con$ent with the torpor of cold feet, as de&s;cribed in Species 6 of this Genus, I &s;u&s;pected this torpor of the lungs to &s;uc|ceed the gout in the feet, or to act a vicarious part for them.</P>

10. <HI>Vertigo rotatoria.</HI> In the vertigo from circumgyration the ir|ritative motions of vi&s;ion are increa&s;ed; which is evinced from the plea&s;ure that children receive on being rocked in a cradle, or by &s;winging on a rope. For whenever &s;en&s;ation ari&s;es from the produc|tion of irritative motion with le&s;s energy than natural, it is of the di&s;agreeable kind, as from cold or hunger; but when it ari&s;es from their production with greater energy than natural, if it be confined within certain limits, it is of the plea&s;urable kind, as by warmth or wine. With the&s;e increa&s;ed irritative motions of vi&s;ion, I &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e of the &s;tomach are performed with greater energy by direct &s;ym|pathy; but when the rotatory motions, which produce this agreeable vertigo, are continued too long, or are too violent, &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach follows; which is owing to the decrea&s;ed action of that or|gan from its rever&s;e &s;ympathy with the increa&s;ed actions of the organ of vi&s;ion. For the expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power by the organ of vi&s;ion is always very great, as appears by the &s;ize of the optic nerves; and is now &s;o much increa&s;ed as to deprive the next link of a&s;&s;ociation of its due &s;hare. As mentioned in Article 6 of this Genus.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner the undulations of water, or the motions of a &s;hip, at fir&s;t give plea&s;ure by increa&s;ing the irritative motions belong|ing to the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion; but produce &s;ickne&s;s at length by expend|ing on one part of the a&s;&s;ociated train of irritative actions too much of that &s;en&s;orial power, which u&s;ually &s;erved the whole of it; whence &s;ome other parts of the train acquire too little of it, and perform their actions in con&s;equence too feebly, and thence become attended with di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that when the irritative motions are &s;ti|mulated into unu&s;ual action, as in inebriation, they become &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation, either of the plea&s;urable or painful kind; and thus a new link is introduced between the irritative motions thus excited, and tho&s;e which u&s;ed to &s;ucceed them; whence the a&s;&s;ociation is either di&s;&s;evered or much weakened, and thus the vomiting in &s;ea&s;ickne&s;s
<PB N="481" REF="4890">
occurs from the defect of the power of a&s;&s;ociation, rather than from the general deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power.</P>
<P>When a blind man turns round, or when one, who is not blind, revolves in the dark, a vertigo is produced belonging to the &s;en&s;e of touch. A blind man balances him&s;elf by the &s;en&s;e of touch, which being a le&s;s perfect means of determining &s;mall quantities of deviation from the perpendicular, occa&s;ions him to walk more carefully upright than tho&s;e, who balance them&s;elves by vi&s;ion. When he revolves, the irritative a&s;&s;ociations of the mu&s;cular motions, which were u&s;ed to pre&s;erve his perpendicularity, become di&s;ordered by their new modes of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive exertion; and he begins to fall. For his feet now touch the floor in manners or directions different from tho&s;e they have been accu&s;tomed to; and in con&s;equence he judges le&s;s perfectly of the &s;ituation of the parts of the floor in re&s;pect to that of his own body, and thus lo&s;es his perpendicular attitude. This may be illu&s;|trated by the curious experiment of cro&s;&s;ing one finger over the next to it, and feeling of a nut or bullet with the ends of them. When, if the eyes be clo&s;ed, the nut or bullet appears to be two, from the deception of the &s;en&s;e of touch.</P>
<P>In this vertigo from gyration, both of the &s;en&s;e of &s;ight, and of the &s;en&s;e of touch, the primary link of the a&s;&s;ociated irritative motions is increa&s;ed in energy, and the &s;econdary ones are increa&s;ed at fir&s;t by direct &s;ympathy; but after a time they become decrea&s;ed by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with the primary link, owing to the exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power in general, or to the power of a&s;&s;ociation in particular; becau&s;e in the la&s;t ca&s;e, either plea&s;urable or painful &s;en&s;ation has been intro|duced between the links of a train of irritative motions, and has di&s;|&s;evered, or much enfeebled them.</P>
<P>Dr. Smyth, in his E&s;&s;ay on Swinging in Pulmonary Con&s;umption, has ob&s;erved, that &s;winging makes the pul&s;e &s;lower. Dr. Ewart of Bath confirmed this ob&s;ervation both on him&s;elf and on Col. Cath$art, who was then hectic, and that even on &s;hipboard, where &s;ome degree
<PB N="482" REF="4900">
of vertigo might be &s;uppo&s;ed previou&s;ly to exi&s;t. Dr. Currie of Liverpool not only confirmed this ob&s;ervation frequently on him&s;elf, when he was al&s;o phthi$ical, but found that equitation had a &s;imilar effect on him, uniformly retarding his pul&s;e. This curious circum|&s;tance cannot ari&s;e from the general effect of exerci&s;e, or fatigue, as in tho&s;e ca&s;es the pul&s;e becomes weaker and quicker; it mu&s;t there|fore be a&s;cribed to a degree of vertigo, which attends all tho&s;e modes of motion, which we are not perpetually accu&s;tomed to.</P>
<P>Dr. Currie has further ob&s;erved, that "in ca&s;es of great debility the voluntary mu&s;cular exertion requi&s;ite in a &s;wing produces weari|ne&s;s, that is, increa&s;es debility; and that in &s;uch in&s;tances he had frequently noticed, that the diminution of the frequency of the pul&s;e did not take place, but the contrary." The&s;e circum&s;tances may thus be accounted for.</P>
<P>The links of a&s;&s;ociation, which are effected in the vertigo occa|&s;ioned by unu&s;ual motion, are the irritative motions of the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion, tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, and tho&s;e of the heart and arteries. When the irritative ideas of vi&s;ion are exerted with greater energy at the beginning of vertigo, a degree of &s;en&s;ation is excited, which is of the plea&s;urable kind, as above mentioned; whence the a&s;&s;ociated trains of irritative motions of the &s;tomach, and heart, and arteries, act at fir&s;t with greater energy, both by direct &s;ympathy, and by the additional &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation. Whence the pul&s;e of a con|&s;umptive patient becomes &s;tronger and con&s;equently &s;lower.</P>
<P>But if this vertigo becomes much greater in degree or duration, the fir&s;t link of this train of a&s;&s;ociated irritative motions expends too much of the &s;en&s;orial power, which was u&s;ually employed on the whole train; and the motions of the &s;tomach become in con&s;equence exerted with le&s;s energy. This appears, becau&s;e in this degree of vertigo &s;ickne&s;s &s;upervenes, as in &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, which has been &s;hewn to be owing to le&s;s energetic action of the &s;tomach. And the mo|tions of the heart and arteries then become weaker, and in con&s;equence
<PB N="483" REF="4910">
more frequent, by their direct &s;ympathy with the le&s;&s;ened ac|tions of the &s;tomach. See Supplement, I. 12. and Cla&s;s II. 1. 6. 7. The general weakne&s;s from fatigue is owing to a &s;imilar cau&s;e, that is, to the too great expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power in the increa&s;ed actions of one part of the &s;y&s;tem, and the con&s;equent deficiency of it in other parts, or in the whole.</P>
<P>The abatement of the heat of the &s;kin in hectic fever by &s;winging, is not only owing to the increa&s;ed ventilation of cool air, but to the rever&s;e &s;ympathy of the motions of the cutaneous capillaries with tho&s;e of the heart and arteries; which occurs in all fevers with arterial debility, and a hot or dry &s;kin. Hence during moderate &s;winging the action of the heart and arteries becomes &s;tronger and &s;lower, and the action of the capillaries, which was before too great, as appeared by the heat of the &s;kin, now is le&s;&s;ened by their rever&s;e &s;ympathy with that of the heart and arteries. See Supplement, I. 8.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Vertigo vi&s;ualis.</HI> Vi&s;ual vertigo. The vertigo rotatoria de&s;cribed above, was induced by the rotation or undulation of external objects, and was attended with increa&s;ed action of the primary link of the a&s;|&s;ociated motions belonging to vi&s;ion, and with con&s;equent plea&s;ure. The vertigo vi&s;ualis is owing to le&s;s perfect vi&s;ion, and is not accom|panied with plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation. This frequently occurs in &s;trokes of the pal&s;y, and is then &s;ucceeded by vomiting; it &s;ometimes pre|cedes epileptic fits, and often attends tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ight begins to be impaired by age.</P>
<P>In this vertigo the irritative ideas of the apparent motions of objects are le&s;s di&s;tinct, and on that account are not &s;ucceeded by their u&s;ual irritative a&s;&s;ociations of motion; but excite our attention. Whence the objects appear to librate or circulate according to the motions of our heads, which is called dizzine&s;s; and we lo&s;e the means of ba|lancing our&s;elves, or pre&s;erving our perpendicularity, by vi&s;ion. So that in this vertigo the motions of the a&s;&s;ociated organs are decrea&s;ed
<PB N="484" REF="4920">
by direct &s;ympathy with their primary link of irritation; as in the preceding ca&s;e of &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s they are decrea&s;ed by rever&s;e &s;ym|pathy.</P>
<P>When vertigo affects people about fifty years of age, their &s;ight has generally been &s;uddenly impaired; and from their le&s;s accurate vi&s;ion they do not &s;oon enough perceive the apparent motions of objects; like a per&s;on in a room, the walls of which are &s;tained with the uni|form figures of lozenges, explained in Sect. XX. 1. This is gene|rally a&s;cribed to indige&s;tion; but it cea&s;es &s;pontaneou&s;ly, as the pa|tient acquires the habit of balancing him&s;elf by le&s;s di&s;tinct objects.</P>
<P>A gentleman about 50 was &s;eized with an uncommon degree of vertigo, &s;o as to fall on the ground, and not to be able to turn his head, as he &s;at up either in his chair or in his bed, and this continued eight or ten weeks. As he had many decayed teeth in his mouth, and the vertigo was preceded and &s;ometimes accompanied by pains on one &s;ide of his head, the di&s;ea&s;e of a tooth was &s;u&s;pected to be the cau&s;e. And as his timidity was too great to admit the extraction of tho&s;e which were decayed; after the trial of cupping repeatedly, fo|mentations on his head, repeated bli&s;ters, with valerian, Peruvian bark, mu&s;k, opium, and variety of other medicines; mercurials were u&s;ed, both externally and internally, with de&s;ign to inflame the mem|branes of the teeth, and by that means to prevent the torpor of the action of the membranes about the temple, and parietal bone; which are catenated with the membranes of the teeth by irritative a&s;&s;ocia|tion, but not by &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation. The event was, that as &s;oon as the gums became $ore with a &s;light ptyali&s;m, the pains about the head and vertigo gradually dimini&s;hed, and during the &s;orene&s;s of his gums entirely cea&s;ed; but I believe recurred afterwards, though in le&s;s degree.</P>
<P>The idea of inflaming the membranes of the teeth to produce in|crea&s;ed &s;en&s;ation in them, and thus to prevent their irritative connec|tion with tho&s;e of the crani$m, was taken from the treatment of tri&s;mus,

Whence when the&s;e latter become much increa&s;ed by the immoderate &s;timulus of wine, the irritative motions of the retina are produced with le&s;s energy by rever&s;e &s;ympathy, and become at the &s;ame time &s;ucceeded by &s;en&s;ation in con&s;equence of their decrea&s;ed action. See Sect. XXI. 3. and XXXV. 1. 2. So conver&s;ely when the irritative motions of vi&s;ion are increa&s;ed by turning round, or by our unaccu&s;tomed agitation at &s;ea, tho&s;e of the &s;tomach become in|verted by rever&s;e &s;ympathy, and are attended in con&s;equence with di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation.

<P>Whence though a certain quantity of vinous &s;pirit &s;timulates the whole &s;y&s;tem into increa&s;ed action, and perhaps even increa&s;es the &s;ecretion of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain; yet as &s;oon as any degree of vertigo is produced, it is a proof, that by the too great expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power by the &s;tomach, and its neare&s;t a&s;&s;ociated motions, the more di&s;tant ones, as tho&s;e of vi&s;ion, become imperfectly exerted. From hence may be deduced the nece&s;&s;ity of exhibiting wine in fevers with weak pul&s;e in only appropriated quantity; becau&s;e if the lea&s;t intoxication be induced, &s;ome part of the &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t act more feebly from the unnece&s;&s;ary expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power.</P>

Now if the&s;e irritative &s;ounds from the partial lo&s;s of hearing do not corre&s;pond with the &s;ize or u&s;ual echoes of the places, where we are; their catenation with other irritative ideas, as tho&s;e of vi&s;ion, becomes di&s;&s;evered or di&s;turbed; and we attend to them in con&s;equence, which I think unravels this intricate circum&s;tance of noi&s;es being always heard in the head, when the &s;en&s;e of hearing begins to be impaired, from whatever cau&s;e it occurs.</P>
<P>This ringing in the ears al&s;o attends the vertigo from intoxication; for the irritative ideas of &s;ound are then more weakly excited in con|&s;equence of the deficiency of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation. As is known by this al&s;o being attended with di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, and by its accompanying other di&s;ea&s;es of debility, as &s;trokes on the head, fainting fits, and paralytic &s;eizures. For in this vertigo from intoxi|cation &s;o much &s;en&s;orial power in general is expended on the increa&s;ed actions of the &s;tomach, and its neare&s;t connections, as the capillaries of the &s;kin; that there is a deficiency for the purpo&s;es of the other irritative a&s;&s;ociations of motions u&s;ually connected with it. This au|ditory vertigo attends both the rotatory and the vi&s;ual vertigo above mentioned; in the former it is introduced by rever&s;e &s;ympathy, that is, by the diminution of &s;en&s;orial power; too great a quantity of it being expended on the increa&s;ed irritative motions of vi&s;ion; in the latter it is produced either by the &s;ame cau&s;es which produce the vi|&s;ual vertigo, or by direct &s;ympathy with it.

The&s;e organs of &s;en&s;e are con&s;tantly &s;timulated into action by the &s;aliva or by the air; hence, like the &s;en&s;e of hunger, when they are torpid from want of &s;timulus, or from want of &s;en&s;orial power, pain or di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation en&s;ues, as of hunger, or faintne&s;s, or &s;ick|ne&s;s in one ca&s;e; and the ideas of bad ta&s;tes or odours in the other.

fever, but al&s;o in the hot paroxy&s;m. The capillary arteries or glands have their actions neverthele&s;s increa&s;ed after the fir&s;t cold fit, as appears by the greater production of heat, and the glow of arterial blood, in the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els; and la&s;tly, the action of the &s;tomach is much impaired or de&s;troyed, as appears by the total want of appe|tite to &s;olid food. Whence it would &s;eem, that the torpid motions of the &s;tomach, whatever may occa&s;ion them, are a very frequent cau&s;e of continued fever with weak pul&s;e; and that the&s;e torpid mo|tions of the &s;tomach do not &s;ufficiently excite the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which contributes in health to actuate the heart and arte|ries along with the irritation produced by the &s;timulus of the blood; and hence the actions of the&s;e organs are weaker. And la&s;tly, that the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which ought to be expended on the motions of the heart and arteries, becomes now exerted on the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries.

<P>IN this genus the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation is exerted with le&s;s energy, and thence the actions produced by it are le&s;s than natural; and pain is produced in con&s;equence, according to the fifth law of animal cau&s;ation, Sect. IV. This pain is generally attended with coldne&s;s of the affected part, and is &s;eldom &s;ucceeded by inflammation of it. This decrea&s;ed action of the &s;econdary link of the a&s;&s;ociated motions, belonging to this genus, is owing to the previous exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power either in the increa&s;ed actions of the primary link of the a&s;&s;ociated motions, or by the pain which attends them; both which are frequently the con&s;equence of the &s;timulus of &s;omething external to the affected fibres.</P>
<P>As pain is produced either by exce&s;s or defect of the natural exer|tions of the fibres, it is not, con&s;idered &s;eparately, a criterion of the pre&s;ence of either. In the a&s;&s;ociations belonging to this genus the &s;en&s;ation of pain or plea&s;ure produces or attends the primary link of the a&s;&s;ociated motions, and very often gives name to the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>When great pain exi&s;ts without cau&s;ing any &s;ibrous motions, I conjecture that it contributes to exhau&s;t or expend the general quan|tity of &s;en&s;orial power; becau&s;e people are fatigued by enduring pain, till at length they &s;leep. Which is contrary to what I had perhaps erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed in Sect. XXXV. 2. 3. If it cau&s;es &s;ibrous mo|tions, it then takes the name of &s;en&s;ation, according to the definition
<PB N="492" REF="5000">
of &s;en&s;ation in Sect. II. 2. 9.; and increa&s;ed fibrous action or inflam|mation is the con&s;equence. This circum&s;tance of the general ex|hau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power by the exi&s;tence of pain will a&s;&s;i&s;t in ex|plaining many of the di&s;ea&s;es of this genus.</P>
<P>Many of the canals of the body, as the urethra, the bile-duct, the throat, have the motions of their two extremities a&s;&s;ociated by having been accu&s;tomed to feel plea&s;urable or painful &s;en&s;ations at the &s;ame time or in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This is termed &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation, though tho&s;e painful or plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations do not cau&s;e the motions, but only attend them; and are thus perhaps, &s;trictly &s;peaking, only ca|tenated with them.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Torpor genae a dolore dentis.</HI> In tooth-ach there is generally a coldne&s;s of the cheek, which is &s;en&s;ible to the hand, and is attended in &s;ome degree with the pain of cold. The cheek and tooth have fre|quently been engaged in plea&s;urable action at the &s;ame time during the ma&s;ticating of our food; whence they have acquired &s;en&s;itive a&s;|&s;ociations. The torpor of the cheek may have for its cau&s;e the too great expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power by the painful &s;en&s;ation of the membranes of the di&s;ea&s;ed tooth; whence the membranes of the cheek a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e of the alveolar proce&s;s are deprived of their natural &s;hare of it, and become torpid; thus they produce le&s;s &s;ecretions, and le&s;s heat, and the pain of cold is the con&s;equence. This torpor of the ve&s;&s;els of the cheek cannot be produced by the ac|tivity of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation; for then they would act more violently than natural, or become inflamed. And though the pain by exhau&s;ting &s;o much &s;en&s;orial power may be a remote cau&s;e, it is the defect of the power of a&s;&s;ociation, which is the immediate cau&s;e of the torpor of the cheek.</P>
<P>After &s;ome hours this pain occa&s;ioned by the torpor of the ve&s;&s;els of
<PB N="493" REF="5010">
the cheek either gradually cea&s;es along with the pain of the di&s;ea&s;ed tooth; or, by the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during their &s;tate of torpor, the capillaries of the cheek act with greater violence, and produce more &s;ecretions, and heat, and con&s;equent tumour, and in|flammation. In this &s;tate the pain of the di&s;ea&s;ed tooth cea&s;es; as the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation is now expended on the inflamed ve&s;|&s;els of the cheek. It is probable that mo&s;t other internal membranous inflammations begin in a &s;imilar manner; whence there may &s;eem to be a double kind of &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation; fir&s;t, with decrea&s;ed action of the a&s;&s;ociated organ, and then with increa&s;ed action of it; but the latter is in this ca&s;e &s;imply the con&s;equence of the former; that is, the tumor or inflammation of the cheek is in con&s;equence of its previous quie&s;cence or torpor.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Stranguria a dolore ve&s;icae.</HI> The &s;trangury, which has its origin from pain at the neck of the bladder, con&s;i&s;ts of a pain in the external extremity of the urethra or of the glans penis of men, and probably in the external termination of the urethra or of the clitoris of women; and is owing to the &s;ympathy of the&s;e with &s;ome di&s;tant parts, gene|rally with the other end of the urethra; an endeavour and difficulty of making water attends this pain.</P>
<P>Its remote cau&s;e is from the internal or external u&s;e of cantharides. which &s;timulate the neck of the bladder; or from a &s;tone, which whenever it is pu&s;hed into the neck of the bladder, gives this pain of &s;trangury, but not at other times; and hence it is felt mo&s;t &s;everely in this ca&s;e after having made water.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ations or &s;en&s;itive motions of the glans penis, and of the &s;phincter of the bladder, have been accu&s;tomed to exi&s;t together during the di&s;charge of the urine; and hence the two ends of the urethra &s;ympathize by a&s;&s;ociation. When there is a &s;tone at the neck of the bladder, which is not &s;o large or rough as to inflame the part, the &s;phincter of the bladder becomes &s;timulated into pain; but as the
<PB N="494" REF="5020">
glans penis is for the purpo&s;es of copulation more &s;en&s;itive than the &s;phincter of the bladder, as &s;oon as it becomes affected with pain by the a&s;&s;ociation above mentioned, the &s;en&s;ation at the neck of the blad|der cea&s;es; and then the pain of the glans penis would &s;eem to be a&s;|&s;ociated with the irritative motions only of the &s;phincter of the bladder, and not with the &s;en&s;itive ones of it. But a circum&s;tance &s;imilar to this occurs in epileptic fits, which at fir&s;t are induced by di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, and afterwards &s;eem to occur without previous pain, from the &s;uddenne&s;s in which they follow and relieve the pain, which occa&s;ioned them. From this analogy I imagine the pain of the glans penis is a&s;&s;ociated with the pain of the &s;phincter of the bladder$ but that <HI>as &s;oon as the greater pain in a more &s;en&s;ible part is produced; the le&s;&s;er one, which occa&s;ioned it, cea&s;es;</HI> and that this is one of the laws of &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation. See Sect. XXXV. 2. 1.</P>
<P>A young man had by an accident &s;wallowed a large &s;poonful or more of tincture of cantharides; as &s;oon as he began to feel the pain of &s;trangury, he was advi&s;ed to drink large quantities of warmi&s;h water; to which, as &s;oon as it could be got, &s;ome gum arabic was added. In an hour or two he drank by intervals of a few minutes about two gallons of water, and di&s;charged his urine every four or five minutes. A little blood was voided towards the end, but he &s;uf|fered no ill con&s;equence.</P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>Stranguria convul&s;iva.</HI> The convul&s;ive &s;trangury, like that be|fore de&s;cribed, is probably occa&s;ioned by the torpor or defective action of the painful part in con&s;equence of the too great expenditure of &s;en|&s;orial power on the primary link of the a&s;&s;ociated motions, as no heat or inflammation attends this violent pain. This kind of &s;trangury
<PB N="495" REF="5030">
recurs by &s;tated periods, and &s;ometimes ari&s;es to &s;o great a degree, that convul&s;ion or temporary madne&s;s terminates each period of it. It affects women oftener than men, is attended with cold extremities without fever, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;tone of the bladder by the regularity of its periods, and by the pain being not increa&s;ed after making water.</P>
<P>On introducing the catheter &s;ometimes part of the urine will come away and not the whole, which is difficult to explain; but may ari&s;e from the weakne&s;s of the mu&s;cular fibres $word$ the bladder; which are not liable &s;uddenly to contract them&s;elves &s;o far as to exclude the whole of the urine. In &s;ome old people, who have experienced a long retention of urine, the bladder never regains the power of com|pletely emptying it&s;elf; and many who are beginning to be weak from age can make water a &s;econd time, a few minutes after they &s;uppo&s;ed they had emptied the bladder.</P>
<P>I have believed this pain to originate from &s;ympathy with &s;ome di&s;tant part, as from a&s;carides in the rectum, or from piles in women; or from caruncles in the urethra about the caput gallinaginis in men; and that the pain has been in the glans or clitoris by rever&s;e &s;ympathy of the&s;e more &s;en&s;ible parts with tho&s;e above mentioned.</P>

from the &s;ame &s;treams of bile pa&s;&s;ing through them in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, ex|actly as the two terminations of the urethra have their actions a&s;&s;o|ciated, as de&s;cribed in Species 2 and 3 of this genus. But as the in|te&s;tinal termination of the bile-duct is made more &s;en&s;ible for the purpo&s;e of bringing down more bile, when it is &s;timulated by new &s;upplies of food from the &s;tomach, it falls into violent pain from a&s;&s;o|ciation; and then the pain on the region of the gall-bladder cea&s;es, exactly as above explained in the account of the pain of the glans penis from a &s;tone in the &s;phincter of the bladder.</P>
<P>The common bile-duct opens into the inte&s;tine exactly at what is called the pit of the &s;tomach; and hence it has &s;ometimes happened, that this pain from a&s;&s;ociation with the &s;en&s;ation of a gall-&s;tone at the other end of the bile-duct has been mi&s;taken for a pain of the &s;tomach.</P>

This di&s;ea&s;e is at|tended with cold &s;kin, and hence whatever may be the remote cau&s;e, the immediate one &s;eems to be want of &s;timulus, either of heat or di&s;tention, or of &s;ome other unknown &s;timulus in the painful part; or in tho&s;e, with which it is a&s;&s;ociated. The membranes in their natural &s;tate are only irritable by di&s;tention; in their di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate, they are &s;en&s;ible like mu&s;cular fibres. Hence a di&s;ea&s;ed tooth may render the neighbouring membranes &s;en&s;ible, and is frequently the cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Sometimes the &s;tomach is torpid along with the pained membrane of the head; and then &s;ickne&s;s and inappetency attends either as a cau&s;e or con&s;equence. The natural cure of hemicrania is the accu|mulation of &s;en&s;orial power during the re&s;t or &s;ickne&s;s of the patient. Mrs.&mdash;is frequently liable to hemicrania with &s;ickne&s;s, which is probably owing to a di&s;ea&s;ed tooth; the paroxy&s;m occurs irregularly, but always after &s;ome previous fatigue, or other cau&s;e of debility. She lies in bed, &s;ick, and without taking any &s;olid food, and very little of fluids, and tho&s;e of the aqueous kind, and, after about 48 or 50 hours, ri&s;es freem from $$$nplaint. Similar to this is the recovery from cold paroxy&s;ms of fever, from the torpor occa&s;ioned by fear, and from &s;yncope; which are all owing to the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during the inactivity of the &s;y&s;tem. Hence it appears, that, though when the &s;en&s;orial power of volition is much exhau&s;ted by fa|tigue, it can be re&s;tored by eight or ten hours of &s;leep; yet, when the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation is exhau&s;ted by fatigue, that it
<PB N="499" REF="5070">
requires two whole &s;olar or lunar days of re&s;t, before it can be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>The late Dr. Monro a&s;&s;erted in his lectures, that he cured the he|micrania, or megrim, by a &s;trong vomit, and a bri&s;k purge immedi|ately after it. This method &s;ucceeds be&s;t if opium and the bark are given in due quantity after the operation of the cathartic; and with &s;till more certainty, if bleeding in &s;mall quantity is premi&s;ed, where the pul&s;e will admit of it. See Sect. XXXV. 2. 1.</P>
<P>The pain generally affects one eye, and &s;preads a little way on that &s;ide of the no&s;e, and may &s;ometimes be relieved by pre&s;&s;ing or cutting the nerve, where it pa&s;&s;es into the bone of the orbit above the eye. When it affects a &s;mall defined part on the parietal bone on one &s;ide, it is generally termed Clavus hy&s;tericus, and is always I believe owing to a di&s;ea&s;ed dens molaris. The tendons of the mu&s;|cles, which &s;erve the office of ma&s;tication, have been extended into pain at the &s;ame time, that the membranous coverings of the roots of the teeth have been compre&s;&s;ed into pain, during the biting or ma&s;ti|cation of hard bodies. Hence when the membranes, which cover the roots of the teeth, become affected with pain by a beginning de|cay, or perhaps by the torpor or coldne&s;s of the dying part of the tooth, the tendons and membranous fa&s;cia of the mu&s;cles about the &s;ame &s;ide of the head become affected with violent pain by their &s;en|&s;itive a&s;&s;ociations: and as &s;oon as this a&s;&s;ociated pain takes place, the pain of the tooth entirely cea&s;es, as explained in the &s;econd &s;pecies of this genus.</P>
<P>A remarkable circum&s;tance attends this kind of hemicrania, viz. that it recurs by periods like tho&s;e of intermittent fevers, as explained in the Section on Catenation of Motions; the&s;e periods &s;ometimes corre&s;pond with alternate lunar or &s;olar days like tertian agues, and that even when a decaying tooth is evidently the cau&s;e; which has been evinced by the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e by extracting the tooth. At
<PB N="500" REF="5080">
other times they ob&s;erve the monthly lunations, and &s;eem to be in|duced by the debility, which attends men&s;truation.</P>
<P>The dens &s;apientiae, or la&s;t tooth of the upper jaw, frequently de|cays fir&s;t, and gives hemicrania over the eye on the &s;ame &s;ide. The fir&s;t or &s;econd grinder in the under-jaw is liable to give violent pain about the middle of the parietal bone, or &s;ide of the head, on the &s;ame &s;ide, which is generally called the Clavus hy&s;tericus, of which an in|&s;tructive ca&s;e is related in Sect. XXXV. 2. 1.</P>
<P>M. M. Detect and extract the di&s;ea&s;ed tooth. Cut the affected nerve, or &s;timulate the di&s;ea&s;ed membrane by acu-puncture. Vene|&s;ection to &s;ix ounces by the lancet or by leeches. A &s;trong emetic and a &s;ub&s;equent cathartic; and then an opiate and the bark. Pa&s;s &s;mall electric &s;hocks through the pained membrane, and through the teeth on the &s;ame &s;ide. Apply vitriolic ether externally, and a grain of opium with camphor internally, to the cheek on the affected &s;ide, where a di&s;ea&s;ed tooth may be &s;u&s;pected. Foment the head with warm vinegar. Drink two large &s;poonfuls of vinegar. Stimulate the gums of the &s;u&s;pected teeth by oil of cloves, by opium. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 4. 4. Snuff volatile &s;pirit of vinegar up the no&s;trils. La&s;tly, in permanent head-achs, as in permanent vertigo, I have &s;een good effect by the u&s;e of mercurial ointment rubbed on the &s;haved head or about the throat, till a mild &s;alivation commences, which by inflaming the membranes of the teeth may prevent their irritative &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the cranium. Thus by inflaming the tendon, which is the cau&s;e of locked jaw, and probably by inflaming the wound, which is the cau&s;e of hydrophobia, tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es may be cured, by di&s;uniting the irritative &s;ympathy between tho&s;e parts, which may not po&s;&s;e&s;s any &s;en&s;itive &s;ympathy. This idea is well worth our attention.</P>
<P><HI>Otalgia.</HI> Ear-ach is another di&s;ea&s;e occa&s;ioned by the &s;ympathy of the membranes of the ear with tho&s;e which inve&s;t or &s;urround a decaying

tooth, as I have had frequent rea&s;on to believe; and is fre|quently relieved by filling the ear with tincture of opium. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 4.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Dolor humeri in hepatidide.</HI> In the efforts of excluding the faeces and urine the mu&s;cles of the &s;houlders are exerted to compre&s;s the air in the lungs, that the diaphragm may be pre&s;&s;ed down. Hence the di&s;tention of the tendons or fibres of the&s;e mu&s;cles is a&s;&s;ociated with the di&s;tention of the tendons or fibres of the diaphragm; and when the latter are pained by the enlargement or heat of the inflamed liver, the former &s;ympathize with them. Sometimes but one &s;houlder is affected, &s;ometimes both; it is probable that many other pains, which are termed rheumatic, have a &s;imilar origin, viz. from &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociations.</P>
<P>As no inflammation is produced in con&s;equence of this pain of the &s;houlder, it &s;eems to be owing to inaction of the membranous part from defect of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, of which the pri|mary link is the inflamed membrane of the liver; which now expends &s;o much of the &s;en&s;orial power in general by its increa&s;ed action, that the membranes about the &s;houlder, which are links of a&s;&s;ociation with it, become deprived of their u&s;ual &s;hare, and con&s;equently fall into torpor.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Torpor pedum in eruptione variolarum.</HI> At the commencement of the eruption of the &s;mall-pox, when the face and brea&s;t of chil|dren are very hot, their extremities are frequently cold. This I a&s;cribe to &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation between the different parts of the &s;kin; whence when a part acts too violently, the other part is liable to act too weakly; and the &s;kin of the face being affected fir&s;t in the erup|tion of the &s;mall-pox, the &s;kin of the feet becomes cold in con&s;e|quence by rever&s;e &s;ympathy.</P>
<P><PB N="502" REF="5100">
M. M. Cover the feet with flannel, and expo&s;e the face and bo&s;om to cool air, which in a very &s;hort time both warms the feet and cools the face; and hence what is erroneou&s;ly called a ra&s;h, but which is probably a too ha&s;ty eruption of the &s;mall-pox, di&s;appears; and after|wards fewer and more di&s;tinct eruptions of the &s;mall-pox &s;uper|vene.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Te&s;tium dolor nephriticus.</HI> The pain and retraction of the te&s;|ticle on the &s;ame &s;ide, when there is a &s;tone in the ureter, is to be a&s;cribed to &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation; whether the connecting cau&s;e be a branch of the fame nerve, or from membranes, which have been fre|quently affected at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Dolor digiti minimi &s;ympatheticus.</HI> When any one accidentally &s;trikes his elbow again&s;t any hard body, a tingling pain runs down to the little finger end. This is owing to &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation of mo|tions by means of the &s;ame branch of a nerve, as in hemicrania from a decaying tooth the pain is owing to the &s;en&s;itive a&s;&s;ociation of ten|dons or membranes.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Dolor brachii in hydrope pectoris.</HI> The pain in the left arm which attends &s;ome drop&s;ies of the che&s;t, is explained in Sect. XXIX. 5. 2. 10. which re&s;embles the pain of the little finger from a per|cu&s;&s;ion of the nerve at the elbow in the preceding article. A numb|ne&s;s of this kind is produced over the whole leg, when the crural nerve is much compre&s;&s;ed by &s;itting for a time with one leg cro&s;&s;ed over the other.</P>
<P>Mr.&mdash;, about &s;ixty, had for two years been affected with dif|ficulty of re&s;piration on any exertion, with pain about the &s;ternum, and of his left arm; which la&s;t was more con&s;iderable than is u&s;ual
<PB N="503" REF="5110">
in drop&s;y of the che&s;t; &s;ome months ago the pain of his arm, after walking a mile or two, became exce&s;&s;ive, with coldne&s;s and numb|ne&s;s; and on the next day the back of the hand, and a part of the arm &s;welled, and became inflamed, which relieved the pain; and was taken for the gout, and continued &s;everal days. He after &s;ome months became drop$ical both in re&s;pect to his che&s;t and limbs, and was &s;ix or &s;even times perfectly relieved by one dram of &s;a|turated tincture of digitalis, taken two or three times a day for a few days in a gla&s;s of peppermint water. He afterwards breathed oxygen gas undiluted, in the quantity of &s;ix or eight gallons a day for three or four weeks without any effect, and &s;unk at length from general debility.</P>
<P>In this in&s;tructive ca&s;e I imagine the pre&s;&s;ure or &s;timulus of one part of the nerve within the che&s;t cau&s;ed the other part, which &s;erves the arm, to become torpid, and con&s;equently cold by &s;ym|pathy; and that the inflammation was the con&s;equence of the pre|vious torpor and coldne&s;s of the arm, in the &s;ame manner as the &s;welling and inflammation of the cheek in tooth-ach, in the fir&s;t &s;pecies of this genus; and that many rheumatic inflammations are thus produced by &s;ympathy with &s;ome di&s;tant part.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Diarrhoea a dentitione.</HI> The diarrhoea, which frequently at|tends dentition, is the con&s;equence of indige&s;tion; the aliment acquires chemical changes, and by its acidity acts as a cathartic; and changes the yellow bile into green, which is evacuated along with indige&s;ted parts of the coagulum of milk. The in|dige&s;tion is owing to the torpor of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines cau&s;ed by their a&s;&s;ociation with the membranes of the gums, which are now &s;timulated into great exertion with pain; both which contribute to expend the general quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, which belongs to this membranous a&s;&s;ociation; and thus the
<PB N="504" REF="5120">
&s;tomach and inte&s;tines act with le&s;s than their natural energy. This is generally e&s;teemed a favourable &s;ymptom in difficult denti|tion, as the pain of the alveolar membranes exhau&s;ts the &s;en&s;orial power without producing convul&s;ions for its relief. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 4. 5. And the diarrhoea cea&s;es, as the tooth advances.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Titubatio linguae.</HI> Impediment of &s;peech is owing to the a&s;&s;oci|ations of the motions of the organs of &s;peech being interrupted or di&s;|&s;evered by ill-employed &s;en&s;ation or &s;en&s;itive motions, as by awe, ba&s;hfulne&s;s, ambition of &s;hining, or fear of not &s;ucceeding, and the per&s;on u&s;es voluntary efforts in vain to regain the broken a&s;&s;ociations, as explained in Sect. XVII. 1. 10. and XVII. 2. 10.</P>
<P>The broken a&s;&s;ociation is generally between the fir&s;t con&s;onant and the &s;ucceeding vowel; as in endeavouring to pronounce the word parable, the p is voluntarily repeated again and again, but the re|mainder of the word does not follow, becau&s;e the a&s;&s;ociation between it and the next vowel is di&s;&s;evered.</P>
<P>M. M. The art of curing this defect is to cau&s;e the &s;tammerer to repeat the word, which he finds difficult to &s;peak, eight or ten times without the initial letter, in a &s;trong voice, or with an a&s;pirate before it, as arable, or harable; and at length to &s;peak it very &s;oftly with the initial letter p, parable. This &s;hould be practi&s;ed for weeks or months upon every word, which the &s;tammerer he&s;itates in pro|nouncing. To this &s;hould be added much commerce with mankind, in order to acquire a carele&s;&s;ne&s;s about the opinions of others.</P>

2. <HI>Chorea St. Viti.</HI> In the St. Vitus's dance the patient can at any time lie &s;till in bed, which &s;hews the motions not to be convul&s;ive; and he can at different times voluntarily exert every mu&s;cle of his body; which evinces, that they are not paralytic. In this di&s;ea&s;e the principal mu&s;cle in any de&s;igned motion obeys the will; but tho&s;e mu&s;cles, who&s;e motions were a&s;&s;ociated with the principal one, do not act; as their a&s;&s;ociation is di&s;&s;evered, and thus the arm or leg is drawn outward, or inward, or backward, in&s;tead of upward or for|ward, with various ge&s;ticulations exactly re&s;embling the impediment of &s;peech.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is frequently left after the itch has been too ha&s;tily cured. See Convul&s;io dolorifica, Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. 6. A girl about eighteen, after wearing a mercurial girdle to cure the itch, acquired the Chorea St. Viti in &s;o univer&s;al a manner, that her &s;peech became affected as well as her limbs; and there was evidently a di&s;union of the common trains of ideas; as the itch was &s;till among the younger children of the family, &s;he was advi&s;ed to take her &s;i&s;ter as a bed|fellow, and thus received the itch again; and the dance of St. Vitus gradually cea&s;ed. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 5. 6.</P>
<P>M. M. Give the patient the itch again. Calomel a grain every night, or &s;ublimate a quarter of a grain twice a day for a fortnight. Steel. Bark. Warm-bath. Cold-bath. Opium. Vene&s;ection once at the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e. Electricity. Perpetual &s;low and repeated efforts to move each limb in the de&s;igned direction, as in the titubatio linguae above de&s;cribed.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Ri&s;us.</HI> Laughter is a perpetual interruption of voluntary exer|tion by the interpo&s;ition of plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation; which not being checked by any important con&s;equences ri&s;es into pain, and requires to be relieved or moderated by the frequent repetition of voluntary exertion.

4. <HI>Tremor ex ir&acirc;.</HI> The trembling of the limbs from anger. The interruption of the voluntary a&s;&s;ociations of motions by anger, origi|nates from too great a part of the &s;en&s;orial power being exerted on the organs of &s;en&s;e; whence the mu&s;cles, which ought to &s;upport the body upright, are deprived of their due quantity, and tremble from debility. See Cla&s;s III. 2. 1. 1.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Rubor ex ir&acirc;.</HI> Redne&s;s from anger. Anger is an exce&s;s of aver|&s;ion, that is of voluntarity not yet employed. It is excited by the pain of offended pride; when it is employed it becomes outrage, cruelty, in&s;anity. The cutaneous capillaries, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the face, are more mobile, that is, more ea&s;ily excited into increa&s;ed ac|tion, or more ea&s;ily become torpid, from le&s;s variation of &s;en&s;orial power, than any other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, which is owing to their being perpetually &s;ubject to the vici&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold, and of exten&s;ion and corrugation. Hence, when an exce&s;s of voluntarity exi&s;ts without being immediately expended in the actions of the large mu&s;cles, the capillary arteries and glands acquire more energetic ac|tion, and a flu&s;hed &s;kin is produced, with increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of per|&s;pirable matter, and con&s;equent heat, owing to the pau&s;e or inter|ruption of voluntary action; and thus the actions of the&s;e cutaneous ve&s;&s;els become a&s;&s;ociated between the ira&s;cent ideas and ira&s;cent mu&s;|cular actions, which are thus for a time interrupted.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Rubor criminati.</HI> The blu&s;hing of accu&s;ed people, whether guilty or not, appears to be owing to circum&s;tances &s;imilar to that of anger; for in the&s;e &s;ituations there is always a &s;udden voluntarity, or wi&s;h, of clearing their characters ari&s;es in the mind of the accu&s;ed per&s;on; which, before an opportunity is given for it to be expended on the large mu&s;cles, influences the capillary arteries and glands, as in the preceding article. Whence the increa&s;ed actions of the capil|laries, and the con&s;equent redne&s;s and heat, become exerted between
<PB N="508" REF="5160">
the voluntary ideas of &s;elf-defence, and the mu&s;cular actions nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e; which la&s;t are thus for a time interrupted or delayed.</P>
<P>Even in the blu&s;h of mode&s;ty or ba&s;hfulne&s;s there is a &s;elf-condem|nation for &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed defect or indecorum, and a &s;udden volunta|rity, or wi&s;h, of &s;elf-defence; which not being expended in actions of the larger mu&s;cles excites the capillaries into action; which in the&s;e &s;ubjects are more mobile than in others.</P>
<P>The blu&s;h of young girls on coming into an a&s;&s;embly room, where they expect their dre&s;s, and &s;teps, and manner to be examined, as in dancing a minuet, may have another origin; and may be con&s;idered as a hot fit of returning confidence, after a previous cold fit of fear.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Tarditas paralytica.</HI> By a &s;troke of the pal&s;y or apoplexy it frequently happens, that tho&s;e ideas, which were a&s;&s;ociated in trains, who&s;e fir&s;t link was a voluntary idea, have their connection di&s;&s;erved; and the patient is under the nece&s;&s;ity by repeated efforts &s;lowly to re|new their a&s;&s;ociations. In this &s;ituation tho&s;e words, which have the fewe&s;t other words a&s;&s;ociated with them, as the proper names of per|&s;ons or places, are the mo&s;t difficult to recollect. And in tho&s;e efforts of recollection the word oppo&s;ite to the word required is often pro|duced, as hot for cold, winter for &s;ummer, which is owing to our a&s;&s;ociating our ideas of things by their oppo&s;ites as well as by their &s;imilitudes, and in &s;ome in&s;tances perhaps more frequently, or more forcibly. Other paralytic patients are liable to give wrong names to external objects, as u&s;ing the word pigs for &s;heep, or cows for hor&s;es; in this ca&s;e the a&s;&s;ociation between the idea of the animal and the name of it is di&s;&s;evered; but the idea of the cla&s;s or genus of the thing remains; and he takes a name from the fir&s;t of the &s;pecies, which pre&s;ents it&s;elf, and &s;ometimes can correct him&s;elf, till he finds the true one.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Tarditas &s;enilis.</HI> Slowne&s;s of age. The difficulty of a&s;&s;ociating

<P>Similar to this is the difficulty which old people experience in learning new bodily movements, that is, in a&s;&s;ociating new mu&s;cular actions, as in learning a new trade or manufactury.

<P>As the di&s;ea&s;es, which obey &s;olar or lunar periods, commence with torpor or inactivity, &s;uch as the cold paroxy&s;ms of fevers, the torpor and con&s;equent pain of hemicrania, and the pains which precede the fits of epilep&s;y and convul&s;ion, it would &s;eem, that the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are more generally owing to the diminution than to the exce&s;s of &s;olar or lunar gravitation; as the di&s;ea&s;es, which originate from the influ|ence of the matter of heat, are much more generally in this country produced by the defect than by the exce&s;s of that fluid.</P>
<P>The periodic returns of &s;o many di&s;ea&s;es coincide with the diurnal, monthly, and annual rounds of time; that any one, who would deny the influence of the &s;un and moon on the periods of quotidian, ter|tian, and quartan fevers, mu&s;t deny their effect on the tides, and on the &s;ea&s;ons. It has generally been believed, that &s;olar and lunar ef|fect was exerted on the blood; which was thus rendered more or le&s;s &s;timulant to the &s;y&s;tem, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XXXII. 6. But as the fluid matter of gravitation permeates and covers all things, like the fluid matter of heat; I am induced to believe, that gravitation acts in its medium &s;tate rather as a cau&s;a $ine qu&acirc; non of animal mo|tion, like heat; which may di&s;order the &s;y&s;tem chemically or me|chanically, when it is dimini&s;hed; but may neverthele&s;s &s;timulate it, when increa&s;ed, into animal exertion.</P>
<P><PB N="511" REF="5190">
Without heat and motion, which &s;ome philo&s;ophers &s;till believe to be the &s;ame thing, as they &s;o perpetually appear together, the particles of matter would attract and move towards each other, and the whole univer&s;e freeze or coale&s;ce into one &s;olid ma&s;s. The&s;e therefore coun|teract the gravitation of bodies to one center; and not only prevent the planets from falling into the &s;un, but become either the efficient cau&s;es of vegetable and animal life, or the cau&s;es without which life cannot exi&s;t; as by their means the component particles of matter are enabled to &s;lide over each other with all the various degrees of fluidity and repul&s;ion.</P>
<P>As the attraction of the moon countervails or dimini&s;hes the ter|rene gravitation of bodies on the &s;urface of the earth; a tide ri&s;es on that &s;ide of the earth, which is turned tow$$ds the moon; and fol|lows it, as the earth revolves. Another $word$ is rai&s;ed at the &s;ame time on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the revolving $word$ which is owing to the greater centrifugal motion of that &s;ide of $word$ earth, which coun|teracts the gravitation of bodies near its &s;urface. For the earth and moon may be con&s;idered as two cannon balls of different &s;izes held together by a chain, and revolving once a month round a common center of gravity between them, near the earth's &s;urface; at the &s;ame time that they perform their annual orbits round the &s;un. Whence the centrifugal force of that &s;ide of the earth, which is farthe&s;t from this center of motion, round which the earth and moon monthly re|volve, is con&s;iderably greater, than the centrifugal force of that &s;ide of the earth, which is neare&s;t it; to which &s;hould be added, that this centrifugal force not only contributes to dimini&s;h the terrene gra|vitation of bodies on the earth's &s;urface on that &s;ide furthe&s;t from this center of motion, but al&s;o to increa&s;e it on that &s;ide, which is neare&s;t it.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance, which tends to rai&s;e the tide on the part of the earth's &s;urface, which is mo&s;t di&s;tant from the moon, is, that the attraction of the moon is le&s;s on that part of the ocean, than it is on
<PB N="512" REF="5200">
the other parts of the earth. Thus the moon may be &s;uppo&s;ed to at|tract the water on the &s;ide of the earth neare&s;t it with a power equal to three; and to attract the central parts of the earth with a power equal to two; and the water on the part of the earth mo&s;t di&s;tant from the moon with a power only equal to one. Hence on the &s;ide of the earth mo&s;t di&s;tant from the moon, the moon's attrac|tion is le&s;s, and the centrifugal force round their common center of motion is greater; both which contribute to rai&s;e the tides on that &s;ide of the earth. On the &s;ide of the earth neare&s;t the moon, the moon's attraction is &s;o much greater as to rai&s;e the tides; though the centrifugal force of the &s;urface of the earth round their common cen|ter of motion in &s;ome degree oppo&s;es this effect.</P>
<P>On the&s;e accounts, when the moon is in the zenith or nadir, the gravitation of bodies on the earth's &s;urface will be greate&s;t at the two oppo&s;ite quadratures; that is, the greate&s;t gravitation of bodies on the earth's &s;urface towards her center during the lunar day is about &s;ix hours and an half after the &s;outhing, or after the northing of the moon.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tances &s;imilar to the&s;e, but in a le&s;s degree, mu&s;t occur in re&s;pect to the &s;olar influence on terre&s;trial bodies; that is, there mu&s;t be a diminution of the gravity of bodies near the earth's &s;urface at noon, when the &s;un is over them; and al&s;o at midnight from the greater centrifugal force of that &s;ide of the earth, which is mo&s;t di&s;|tant from the center, round which the earth moves in her annual orbit, than on the &s;ide neare&s;t that center. Whence it likewi&s;e fol|lows, that the gravitation of bodies towards the earth is greate&s;t about &s;ix hours after noon, and after midnight.</P>
<P>Now when the &s;un and moon have their united gravitation on the &s;ame &s;ide of the earth, as at the new moon; or when the &s;olar attrac|tion coincides with the greater centrifugal motion of that &s;ide of the earth, which is furthe&s;t di&s;tant from the moon, as at the full moon; and when this happens about noon or midnight, the gravitation of
<PB N="513" REF="5210">
terrene bodies towards the earth will be greater about &s;ix hours after+noon, and after midnight, than at any other part of the lunar period; becau&s;e the attraction of both the&s;e luminaries is then exerted on tho&s;e &s;ides of the earth over which they hang, which at other times of the month are more or le&s;s exerted on other parts of it.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, as heat and motion counteract the gravitation of the par|ticles of bodies to each other, and hence become either the efficient cau&s;es of vegetable and animal life, or the cau&s;es without which life cannot exi&s;t, it &s;eems to follow, that when our gravitation towards the earth's center is greate&s;t, the powers of life &s;hould be the lea&s;t: and hence that tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which begin with torpor, &s;hould occur about &s;ix hours after the &s;olar or lunar noon, or about &s;ix hours after the &s;olar or lunar midnight; and this mo&s;t frequently about &s;ix hours after or before the new or full moon; and e&s;pecially when the&s;e happen at noon or at midnight; or la&s;tly, according to the combina|tion of the&s;e powers in dimini&s;hing or increa&s;ing the earth's attraction to bodies on its &s;urface.</P>
<P>The returns or exacerbations of many fevers, both irritative and inflammatory, about &s;ix in the evening, and of the periodic cough de&s;cribed in Sect. XXXVI. 3. 9. countenance this theory. Tables might be made out to &s;hew the combined powers of the &s;un and moon in dimini&s;hing the gravitation of bodies on the earth's &s;urface, at every part of their diurnal, monthly, and annual periods; and which might facilitate the elucidation of this &s;ubject. But I am well aware of the difficulty of its application to di&s;ea&s;es, and hope the&s;e conjectures may induce others to publi&s;h more numerous ob&s;ervations, and more conclu&s;ive rea&s;onings.</P>

<P>A few days ago I &s;aw a young man of delicate con&s;titution in what was called a fit of the a&s;thma; he had about two months before had a peripneumony, and had been ever &s;ince &s;ubject to difficult re&s;piration on exertion, with occa&s;ional palpitation of his heart. He was now &s;eized about eight at night after &s;ome exertion of mind in his bu&s;ine&s;s with cold extremities, and difficulty of breathing. He gradually be|came wor&s;e, and in about half an hour, the palpitation of his heart and difficult re&s;piration were very alarming; his whole &s;kin was cold and pale, yet he did not &s;hudder as in cold paroxy&s;m of fever; his tongue from the point to the middle became as cold as his other ex|tremities, with cold breath. He &s;eemed to be in the act of dying, except that his pul&s;e continued equal in time, though very quick. He lo&s;t three ounces of blood, and took ten drops of laudanum with mu&s;k and &s;alt of hart&s;horn, and recovered in an hour or two without any cold &s;weat.</P>
<P>There being no cold &s;weat &s;eems to indicate, that there was no accumulation of &s;erous fluid in the lungs; and that their inactivity, and the coldne&s;s of the breath, was owing to the &s;ympathy of the air-cells with &s;ome di&s;tant part.

The cau&s;e of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations are explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 1.</P>
<P>The&s;e torpid actions of the capillaries and mu&s;cles of the limbs are not cau&s;ed immediately by the painful &s;en&s;ation of fear; as in that ca&s;e they would have been increa&s;ed and not decrea&s;ed actions, as oc|curs in anger; where the painful volition increa&s;es the actions of the capillaries, exciting a blu&s;h and heat of the &s;kin. Whence we may gain &s;ome knowledge of what is meant by depre&s;&s;ing and exciting pa&s;&s;ions; the former con&s;i&s;ting of ideas attended with pain, which pain occa&s;ions no mu&s;cular actions, like the pain of cold head-ach;

the latter being attended with volitions, and con&s;equent mu&s;cular ex|ertions.</P>
<P>That is, the pain of fear, and the pain of anger, are produced by the exertion of certain ideas, or motions of certain nerves of &s;en&s;e; in the former ca&s;e, the painful &s;en&s;ation of fear produces no mu&s;cular actions, yet it exhau&s;ts or employs &s;o much &s;en&s;orial power, that the whole &s;y&s;tem acts more feebly, or becomes retrograde; but &s;ome parts of it more &s;o than others, according to their early a&s;&s;ociations de&s;cribed in Sect. XVI. 8. 1. hence the tremor of the limbs, palpitation of heart, and even &s;yncope. In anger the painful volition produces vio|lent mu&s;cular actions; but if previous to the&s;e any deliberation oc|curs, a flu&s;hed countenance &s;ometimes, and a red &s;kin, are produced by this &s;uperabundance of volition exerted on the arterial &s;y&s;tem; but at other times the &s;kin becomes pale, and the legs tremble, from the exhau&s;tion or expenditure of the &s;en&s;orial power by the painfu volitions of anger on the organs of &s;en&s;e, as by the painful &s;en&s;ations of fear above mentioned.</P>
<P>Where the pa&s;&s;ion of fear exi&s;ts in a great degree, it exhau&s;ts or expends &s;o much &s;en&s;orial power, either &s;imply by the pain which attends it, or by the violent and perpetual excitement of the terrific imaginations or ideas, that not only a cold and pale &s;kin, but a retro|grade motion of the cutaneous ab&s;orbents occurs, and a cold &s;weat appears upon the whole &s;urface of the body, which probably &s;ome|times increa&s;es pulmonary ab&s;orption; as in Cla&s;s II. 1. 6. 4. and as in the cold &s;weats, which attend the paroxy&s;ms of humoral a&s;thma. Hence anxiety, which is a continued pain of fear, &s;o univer&s;ally de|bilitates the con&s;titution as to occa&s;ion a lingering death; which hap|pens much more frequently than is u&s;ually &s;uppo&s;ed; and the&s;e vic|tims of continued anxiety are &s;aid to die of a broken heart.

6. <HI>Palpitatio cordis a timore.</HI> The palpitation of the heart from fear is owing to the weak action of it, and perhaps &s;ometimes to the retrograde exertion of the ventricules and auricles; becau&s;e it &s;eems to be affected by its a&s;&s;ociation with the capillaries, the actions of which, with tho&s;e of the arteries and veins, con&s;titute one great circle of a&s;&s;ociate motions. Now when the capillaries of the &s;kin become torpid, coldne&s;s and palene&s;s &s;ucceed; and with the&s;e are a&s;&s;ociated the capillaries of the lungs, whence difficult re&s;piration; and with the&s;e the weak and retrograde actions of the heart. At the &s;ame time the ab&s;orbents of the &s;kin, and of the bladder, and of the inte&s;tines, &s;ometimes become retrograde, and regurgitate their contents; as appears by the pale urine in large quantities, which attends hy&s;teric complaints along with this palpitation of the heart; and from the cold &s;weats, and diarrhoea; all which, as well as the hy&s;teric complaints, are liable to be induced or attended by fear.</P>
<P>When fear has &s;till more violently affected the &s;y&s;tem, there have been in&s;tances where &s;yncope, and &s;udden death, or a total &s;toppage of the circulation, have &s;ucceeded: in the&s;e la&s;t ca&s;es, the pain of fear has employed or exhau&s;ted the whole of the &s;en&s;orial power, &s;o that not only tho&s;e mu&s;cular fibres generally exerted by volition cea&s;e to act, whence the patient falls down; and tho&s;e, which con&s;titute the organs of &s;en&s;e, whence &s;yncope; but la&s;tly tho&s;e, which perform the vital motions, become deprived of &s;en&s;orial power, and death en&s;ues. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 4. and I. 2. 1. 10. Similar to this in &s;ome epileptic fits the patient fir&s;t &s;uddenly falls down, with|out even endeavouring to &s;ave him&s;elf by his hands before the con|vul&s;ive motions come on. In this ca&s;e the great exertion of &s;ome &s;mall part in con&s;equence of great irritation or &s;en&s;ation exhau&s;ts the whole &s;en&s;orial power, which was lodged in the extremities of the locomotive nerves, for a &s;hort time, as in &s;yncope; and as &s;oon as

<P N="7">7. <HI>Abortio a timore.</HI> Women mi&s;carry much more frequently from a fright, than from bodily injury. A torpor or retrograde motion of the capillary arteries of the internal uterus is probably the immediate cau&s;e of the&s;e mi&s;carriages, owing to the a&s;&s;ociation of the actions of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els with the capillaries of the &s;kin, which are rendered torpid or retrograde by fear. By this contrac|tion of the uterine arteries, the fine ve&s;&s;els of the placenta, which are in&s;erted into them, are detruded, or otherwi&s;e &s;o affected, that the placenta &s;eparates at this time from the uterus, and the fetus dies from want of oxygenation. A &s;trong young woman, in the fifth or &s;ixth month of her pregnancy, who has &s;ince borne many children, went into her cellar to draw beer; one of the &s;ervant boys was hid behind a barrel, and &s;tarted out to &s;urpri&s;e her, believing her to be the maid-&s;ervant; &s;he began to flood immediately, and mi&s;carried in a few hours.

<P N="8">8. <HI>Hy&s;teria a timore.</HI> Some delicate ladies are liable to fall into hy&s;teric fits from &s;udden fright. The peri&s;taltic motions of the bowels and &s;tomach, and tho&s;e of the oe&s;ophagus, make a part of the great circle of irritative motions with tho&s;e of the &s;kin, and many other membranes. Hence when the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els be|come torpid from their rever&s;e &s;ympathy with the painful ideas of fear; the&s;e of the bowels, and &s;tomach, and oe&s;ophagus, become fir&s;t torpid by direct &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the &s;kin, and then feebly and ineffectually invert the order of their motions, which con&s;titutes a paroxy&s;m of the hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e.

<P>For the action of vomiting, as well as the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation of &s;ickne&s;s, are &s;hewn to be occa&s;ioned by defect of the &s;en&s;orial power; which in this ca&s;e is owing to the greater expenditure of it by the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion. On the &s;ame account the vomiting, which attends the pa&s;&s;age of a &s;tone through the ureter, or from an inflammation of the bowels, or in the commencement of &s;ome fevers, is cau&s;ed by the increa&s;ed expenditure of the &s;en&s;orial power by the too great ac|tion of &s;ome links of the a&s;&s;ociations of irritative motions; and there being in con&s;equence a deficiency of the quantity required for other links of this great catenation.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power by

<P N="4">4. <HI>Vomitio a calculo in ur$tere.</HI> The action of vomiting in con&s;e|quence of the increa&s;ed or decrea&s;ed actions of the ureter, when a &s;tone lodges in it.

<P>For as vomiting is a decrea&s;ed action of the &s;tomach, as explained in Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be produced by the pain of gravel in the ureter alone, as it &s;hould then be an increa&s;ed ac|tion, not a decrea&s;ed one.</P>
<P>The perpetual vomiting in ileus is cau&s;ed in like manner by the defective excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation by the bowel, which is torpid during the intervals of pain; and the &s;tomach &s;ym|pathizes with it.

<P N="1">1. When a &s;mall part of the cutaneous capillaries with their mu|cous or per&s;pirative glands are for a &s;hort time expo&s;ed to a colder me|dium, as when the hands are immer&s;ed in iced water for a minute, the&s;e capillary ve&s;&s;els and their glands become torpid or quie&s;cent, owing to the education of the &s;timulus of heat. The &s;kin then be|comes pale, becau&s;e no blood pa&s;&s;es through the external capillaries; and appears &s;hrunk, becau&s;e their &s;ides are collap&s;ed from inactivity, not contracted by &s;pa&s;m; the roots of the hair are left prominent from the &s;eceding or &s;ub&s;iding of the &s;kin around them; and the pain of coldne&s;s is produced.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, if the u&s;ual degree of warmth be applied, the&s;e ve&s;&s;els regain their activity; and having now become more irritable from an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation during their quie&s;cence, a greater exertion of them follows, with an increa&s;ed glow of the &s;kin, and another kind of pain, which is called the hot-ach; but no fever, properly &s;o called, is yet produced; as this effect is not univer&s;al, nor permanent, nor recurrent.</P>
<P N="2">2. If a greater part of the cutaneous capillaries with their mucous and per&s;pirative glands be expo&s;ed for a longer time to cold, the torpor
<PB N="539" REF="5470">
or quie&s;cence becomes extended by direct &s;ympathy to the heart and arteries; which is known by the weakne&s;s, and con&s;equent fre|quency of the pul&s;e in cold fits of fever.</P>
<P>This requires to be further explained. The movements of the heart and arteries, and the whole of the circulatory ve&s;&s;els, are in ge|neral excited into action by the two &s;en&s;orial powers of irritation, and of a&s;&s;ociation. The former is excited by &s;timulus, the latter by the previous actions of a part of the vital circle of motions. In the above &s;ituation the capillaries act weakly from defect of irritation, which is cau&s;ed by deficient &s;timulus of heat; but the heart and arteries act weakly from defect of a&s;&s;ociation, which is owing to the weak action of the capillaries; which does not now excite the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation into action with &s;ufficient energy.</P>
<P>After a time, either by the application of warmth, or by the in|crea&s;e of their irritability owing to the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation during their previous quie&s;cence, the capillary ve&s;&s;els and glands act with greater energy than natural; whence the red colour and heat of the &s;kin. The heart and arteries acquire a greater &s;trength of pul&s;ation, and continue the frequency of it, owing to the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation during their previous torpor, and their con&s;equent greater a&s;&s;ociability; which is now al&s;o more &s;trongly excited by the increa&s;ed actions of the capil|laries. And thus a fit of &s;imple fever is produced, which is termed Febris irritativa; and con&s;i&s;ts of a torpor of the cutaneous capillaries with their mucous and per&s;pirative glands, accompanied with a torpor of the heart and arteries; and afterwards of an increa&s;ed action of all the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, by what is termed direct &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>This fever, with &s;trong pul&s;e without inflammation, or febris ir|ritativa, de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s I. 1. 1. 1. is frequently &s;een in vernal in|termittents, as the orga&s;m of the heart and arteries is then occa&s;ioned by their previous &s;tate of torpor; but more rarely I believe exi&s;ts in the type of continued fever, except there be an evident remi&s;&s;ion, or
<PB N="540" REF="5480">
approximation to a cold fit; at which time a new accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation is produced; which afterwards actuates the heart and arteries with unnatural vigour; or unle&s;s there be &s;ome &s;timulus perpetually acting on the &s;y&s;tem, &s;o as to induce an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain, as occurs in &s;light degrees of intoxication. Since without one or other of the&s;e circum&s;tances in continued fevers without inflammation, that is, without the addi|tional &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation being introduced, it &s;eems difficult to account for the production of &s;o great a quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, as mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary to give perpetual increa&s;e of action to the whole &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="3">3. On the contrary, while the cutaneous capillaries with their mu|cous and per&s;pirative glands acquire an increa&s;ed irritability, as above, by the accumulation of that &s;en&s;orial power during their previous quie&s;cence, and thus con&s;titute the hot fit of fever; if the heart and arteries do not acquire any increa&s;e of a&s;&s;ociability, but continue in their &s;tate of torpor, another kind of &s;imple fever is produced; which is generally of the continued kind, and is termed Febris inirritativa; which con&s;i&s;ts of a previous torpor of the capillaries of the &s;kin, and of the heart and arteries by direct &s;ympathy with them; and after|wards of an orga&s;m or increa&s;ed action of the capillaries of the &s;kin, with a decrea&s;ed action, or continued torpor, of the heart and arteries by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with them. This orga&s;m of the cutaneous ca|pillaries, which appears by the blu&s;h and heat of the &s;kin, is at fir&s;t owing to the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation during their previous torpid &s;tate, as in the febris irritata above de&s;cribed; but which is afterwards &s;upported or continued by the rever&s;e &s;ym|pathy of the&s;e capillaries with the torpid &s;tate of the heart and arteries, as will be further explained in article 8 of this Supple|ment.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="541" REF="5490">
4. The renovated activity of the capillaries commences as &s;oon or &s;ooner than that of the heart and arteries after the cold fit of irritative fever; and is not owing to their being forced open by the blood being impelled into them mechanically, by the renovated action of the heart and arteries; for the&s;e capillaries of the &s;kin have greater mobility than the heart and arteries, as appears in the &s;udden blu&s;h of &s;hame; which may be owing to their being more liable to perpetual varieties of activity from their expo&s;ure to the vici&s;&s;itudes of atmo&s;pheric heat. And becau&s;e in inirritative fevers, or tho&s;e with arterial debility, the capillaries acquire increa&s;ed &s;trength, as is evinced by the heat of the &s;kin, while the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries remain feeble.</P>
<P N="5">5. It was &s;aid above, that the cutaneous capillaries, when they were rendered torpid by expo&s;ure to cold, either recovered their ac|tivity by the reapplication of external warmth; or by their increa&s;ed irritability, which is cau&s;ed by the accumulation of that &s;en&s;orial power during their quie&s;cence. An example of the former of the&s;e may be &s;een on emerging from a very cold bath; which produces a fit of &s;imple fever; the cold fit, and con&s;equent hot fit, of which may be prolonged by continuing in the bath; which has indeed proved fatal to &s;ome weak and delicate people, and to others after having been much exhau&s;ted by heat and exerci&s;e. See Sect. XXXII. 3. 2. An example of the latter may be taken from going into a bath of about eighty degrees of heat, as into the bath at Buxton, where the bather fir&s;t feels a chill, and after a minute becomes warm, though he remains in the &s;ame medium, owing to the increa&s;e of ir|ritability from the accumulation of that &s;en&s;orial power during the &s;hort time, which the chilne&s;s continued.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hence &s;imple fevers are of two kinds; fir&s;t, the febris irritativa, or fever with &s;trong pul&s;e; which con&s;i&s;ts of a previous torpor of the heart, arteries, and capillaries, and a &s;ucceeding orga&s;m of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els.
<PB N="542" REF="5500">
Secondly, the febris inirritativa, or fever with weak pul&s;e, which con&s;i&s;ts of a previous torpor of the heart, arteries, and capilla|ries; and of a &s;ucceeding orga&s;m of the capillaries, the torpor of the heart and arteries continuing. But as the frequency of the pul&s;e oc|curs both in the &s;tate of torpor, and in that of orga&s;m, of the heart and arteries; this con&s;titutes a criterion to di&s;tingui&s;h fever from other di&s;ea&s;es, which are owing to the torpor of &s;ome parts of the &s;y&s;tem, as pare&s;is, and hemicrania.</P>
<P N="7">7. The reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that where the cutaneous or pulmonary capillaries are mentioned, their mucous and per&s;pirative glands are to be under&s;tood as included; but that the ab&s;orbents be|longing to tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems of ve&s;&s;els, and the commencement of the veins, are not always included; as the&s;e are liable to torpor &s;eparately, as in ana&s;arca, and petechiae; or to orga&s;m, or increa&s;ed action, as in the exhibition of &s;trong emetics, or in the application of vinegar to the lips; yet he will al&s;o plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that an increa&s;ed or decrea&s;ed action of the&s;e ab&s;orbents and veins generally occurs along with that of the capillaries, as appears by the dry &s;kin in hot fits of fever; and from there being generally at the &s;ame time no accumulation of venous blood in the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els, which would appear by its purple colour.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Compound Fever.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. When other parts of the &s;y&s;tem &s;ympathize with this torpor and orga&s;m of the cutaneous capillaries, and of the heart and arteries; the fever-fit becomes more complicated and dangerous; and this in proportion to the number and con&s;equence of &s;uch affected parts. Thus if the lungs become affected, as in going into very cold water, a &s;hortne&s;s of breath occurs; which is owing to the collap&s;e or inactivity
<PB N="543" REF="5510">
(not to the active contraction, or &s;pa&s;m), of the pulmonary ca|pillaries; which, as the lungs are not &s;en&s;ible to cold, are not &s;ubject to painful &s;en&s;ation, and con&s;equent &s;huddering, like the &s;kin. In this ca&s;e after a time the pulmonary capillaries, like the cutaneous ones, act with increa&s;ed energy; the breathing, which was before quick, and the air thrown out at each re&s;piration in le&s;s quantity, and cool to the back of the hand oppo&s;ed to it, now becomes larger in quantity, and warmer than natural; which however is not accom|panied with the &s;en&s;ation of heat in the membrane, which lines the air-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, as in the &s;kin.</P>
<P N="2">2. One con&s;equence of this increa&s;ed heat of the breath is the in|crea&s;ed evaporation of the mucus on the tongue and no&s;trils. A vi&s;cid material is &s;ecreted by the&s;e membranes to pre&s;erve them moi&s;t and &s;upple, for the purpo&s;es of the &s;en&s;es of ta&s;te and of &s;mell, which are extended beneath their &s;urfaces; this vi&s;cid mucus, when the aqueous part of it is evaporated by the increa&s;ed heat of the re&s;pired air, or is ab&s;orbed by the too great action of the mucous ab&s;orbents, adheres clo&s;ely on tho&s;e membranes, and is not without difficulty to be &s;epa|rated from them. This dryne&s;s of the tongue and no&s;trils is a cir|cum&s;tance therefore worthy to be attended to; a$ it &s;hews the in|crea&s;ed action of the pulmonary capillaries, and the con&s;equent in|crea&s;ed heat of the expired air; and may thus indicate, when colder air &s;hould be admitted to the patient. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 3. 1. The middle part of the tongue becomes dry &s;ooner, and recovers its moi&s;|ture later, than the edges of it; becau&s;e the currents of re&s;pired air pa&s;s mo&s;t over the middle part of it. This however is not the ca&s;e, when the dryne&s;s of the tongue is owing only to the increa&s;ed mucous ab&s;orption. When however a frequent cough attends pulmonary in|flammation, the edges of the tongue are liable to be as much furred as the middle of it; as during the action of coughing the middle of the tongue is depre&s;&s;ed, &s;o as to form half a cylinder, to give a greater
<PB N="544" REF="5520">
aperture for the emi&s;&s;ion of air from the larynx; and the edges of it become thus as much expo&s;ed to the currents of air, as the middle parts of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the internal capillaries or glands &s;ympathize with the cutaneous capillaries; or when any of them are previou&s;ly affected with torpor, and the external or cutaneous capillaries are affected &s;e|condarily; other &s;ymptoms are produced, which render the paroxy&s;ms of fever &s;till more complicate. Thus if the &s;pleen or pancreas are primarily or &s;econdarily affected, &s;o as to be rendered torpid or quie&s;|cent, they are liable to become enlarged, and to remain &s;o even after the extinction of the fever-fit. The&s;e in &s;ome intermittent fevers are perceptible to the hand, and are called ague-cakes; their tumour &s;eems to be owing to the permanent torpor of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els continuing to act &s;ome time afterwards. If the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the liver are affected fir&s;t with torpor, and after|wards with orga&s;m, a greater &s;ecretion of bile is produced, which &s;ometimes cau&s;es a diarrhoea. If a torpor of the kidneys, and of the ab&s;orbents of the bladder occurs, either primarily, or by &s;ympathy with the cutaneous capillaries, the urine is in &s;mall quantity and pale, as explained in Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 5.; and if the&s;e &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the kidneys, and the ab&s;orbents of the bladder act more &s;trongly than na|tural afterwards by their increa&s;ed irritability or a&s;&s;ociability, the urine becomes in larger quantity, and deeper coloured, or depo&s;its its earthy parts, as in Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 4. which has been e&s;teemed a favourable circum&s;tance. But if the urine be in &s;mall quantity, and no &s;ediment appears in it, after the hot fit is over; it &s;hews, that the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els of the kidneys and the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the bladder have not regained the whole of their activity, and thence indicates a greater tendency to a return of the cold $it.</P>
<P N="4">4. When the &s;tomach is affected with torpor either primarily; or
<PB N="545" REF="5530">
&s;econdarily by its &s;ympathy with the cutaneous capillaries; or with &s;ome internal vi&s;cus; &s;ickne&s;s occurs, with a total want of appetite to any thing &s;olid; vomiting then &s;upervenes, which may often be relieved by a bli&s;ter on the &s;kin, if the &s;kin be cool and pale; but not if it be hot and flu&s;hed. The inte&s;tines cea&s;e to perform their office of ab&s;orption from a &s;imilar torpor; and a diarrhoea &s;upervenes owing to the acrimony of their putrid, or of their acid contents. The loo&s;e undige&s;ted or fetid &s;tools indicate the inability of the inte&s;tines to per|form their proper office; as the mucus and ga&s;tric acid, which are vomited up, does that of the &s;tomach; this torpor of the &s;tomach is liable to continue after the cold paroxy&s;m cea&s;es, and to convert in|termittent fevers into continued ones by its direct &s;ympathy with the heart and arteries. See article 10 of this Supplement.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the meninges of the brain &s;ympathize with other torpid part$, or are primarily affected, delirium, &s;tupor, and perhaps hydrocephalus internus occur, &s;ee Cla&s;s II. 1. 7. 1. and I. 2. 5. 10; and &s;ometimes the pul&s;e becomes &s;low, producing pare&s;is in&s;tead of fever. But if the membranes, which cover the mu&s;cles about the head, or of the pericranium, become torpid by their &s;ympathy with other torpid parts, or are primarily affected, a head-ach &s;upervenes; which however generally cea&s;es with the cold paroxy&s;m of fever. For as when the &s;en&s;orial power of volition is exhau&s;ted by labour, a few hours, or half a &s;olar day, pa&s;&s;ed in &s;leep recruits the &s;y&s;tem by accumulation of this &s;en&s;orial power; &s;o when the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation is exhau&s;ted, one or two &s;olar or lunar days of re&s;t or quie&s;cence of the affected part will generally re&s;tore its action by accumulation of irrita|bility, and con&s;equent increa&s;e of a&s;&s;ociation, as in hemicrania, Cla&s;s IV. 2. 2. 8. But when the heart and arteries become torpid, either primarily, or by their &s;ympathy with the &s;tomach, this accumul$|tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation can take place but &s;lowly; <HI>is to re&s;t is death!</HI> This explains the cau&s;e of the duration of fevers with
<PB N="546" REF="5540">
weak pul&s;e, which continue a quarter, or half, or three quarters, or a whole lunation, or &s;till longer, before &s;ufficient accumulation of irritability can be produced to re&s;tore their natural &s;trength of action.</P>
<P N="6">6. If the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which are &s;pread around the neck of the bladder, become torpid by their direct &s;ympathy with the ab|&s;orbents of the &s;kin in cold fits of fever; the urine, which is poured into the bladder in but &s;mall quantity from the torpid kidneys, has neverthele&s;s none of its aqueous &s;aline part reab&s;orbed; and this &s;aline part &s;timulates the bladder to empty it&s;elf frequently, though the urine is in &s;mall quantity. Which is not therefore owing to any &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pa&s;m of the bladder, for the action of it in excluding the urine is weak, and as much controlable by the will as in ordi|nary micturition.</P>
<P N="7">7. If the beginnings or ab&s;orbent mouths of the venous &s;y&s;tem re|main torpid, petechiae or vibices are produced in fevers, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which are &s;een in &s;curvy without fever. If the &s;kin was fre|quently moi&s;tened for an hour, and at the &s;ame time expo&s;ed to the common air, or to oxygen gas, it might contribute to turn the black colour of the&s;e points of extrava&s;ated blood into &s;carlet, and thus by increa&s;ing its &s;timulus facilitate its reab&s;orption? For oxygen gas pe|netrates moi&s;t animal membranes though not dry ones, as in the lungs during re&s;piration.</P>
<P N="8">8. When the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation is introduced into the ar|terial &s;y&s;tem, other kinds of compound fevers are produced, which will be &s;poken of in their place.</P>

<HEAD><HI>III.</HI> Termination of the cold Fit.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. If all the parts, which were affected with torpor, regain their irritability, and a&s;&s;ociability, the cold paroxy&s;m of fever cea&s;es; but as &s;ome of the parts affected were previou&s;ly accu&s;tomed to ince&s;&s;ant action, as the heart and arteries, and others only to intermitted ac|tion, as the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines; and as tho&s;e, which are &s;ub|jected during health to perpetual action, accumulate &s;en&s;orial power fa&s;ter, when their motions are impeded, than tho&s;e which are &s;ub|jected to intermitted action; it happens, that &s;ome of the parts, which were affected with torpor during the cold fit, recover their ir|ritability or a&s;&s;ociability &s;ooner than others, and more perfectly, or acquire a greater quantity of them than natural; as appears by the partial heat and flu&s;hings previous to the general hot fit.</P>
<P>Hence if all the parts, which were previou&s;ly torpid, regain their due degree of irritability, or of a&s;&s;ociability, the di&s;ea&s;e is removed, and health re&s;tored. If &s;ome or all of them acquire more than their natural degree of the&s;e &s;en&s;orial powers; increa&s;ed actions, and con|&s;equent increa&s;ed &s;ecretions, and greater heat occur, and con&s;titute the hot fit of fever. If after this hot fit of fever all the parts, which had acquired too great irritability, or a&s;&s;ociability, regain their natural degree of it; the di&s;ea&s;e is removed, and health re&s;tored. But if &s;ome of the&s;e parts do not regain their natural degree of the&s;e &s;en&s;o|rial powers, the actions of tho&s;e parts remain imperfect, and are more or le&s;s injurious to the &s;y&s;tem, according to the importance of their functions.</P>
<P N="2">2. Thus if a torpor of the heart and arteries remains; the quick pul&s;e without &s;trength, which began in the cold fit, per&s;i&s;ts; and a continued fever is produced. If the torpor of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines
<PB N="548" REF="5560">
remains, which are known by &s;ickne&s;s and undige&s;ted &s;tools, the fever is liable to be of con&s;iderable length and danger; the &s;ame if the kidnies and ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem retain &s;ome degree of torpor, as is &s;hewn by the pale urine in not unu&s;ual quantity. If part of the ab|&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem remains torpid, as the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the &s;pleen, a tumour of that vi&s;cus occurs, which may be felt by the hand; the &s;ame &s;ometimes happens to the liver; and the&s;e from their tendency to more complete torpor are afterwards liable to give occa&s;ion to a re|turn of the cold fit. If the cellular ab&s;orbents do not completely re|cover their activity, a pale and bloated countenance with &s;welled legs mark their want of action.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the termination of the cold fit is owing to the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation and of a&s;&s;ociation during the previ|ous quie&s;cence of the &s;y&s;tem; and as tho&s;e parts, which are in per|petual action during health, are more &s;ubject to this accumulation during their torpor, or quie&s;cence; one &s;hould have imagined, that the heart and arteries would acquire this accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power &s;ooner or in greater degree than other parts. This indeed &s;o happens, where the pul&s;e is previou&s;ly &s;trong, as in febris irritativa; or where another &s;en&s;orial power, as that of &s;en&s;ation, is exerted on the arterial &s;y&s;tem, as in inflammations. The heart and arteries in the&s;e ca&s;es &s;oon recover from their torpor, and are exerted with great violence.</P>
<P>Many other parts of the &s;y&s;tem &s;ubject to perpetual motion in health may re&s;t for a time without much inconvenience to the whole; as when the fingers of &s;ome people become cold and pale; and during this complete re&s;t great accumulation of irritability may be produced. But where the heart and arteries are previou&s;ly feeble, they cannot much dimini&s;h their actions, and certainly cannot re&s;t entirely, for that would be death; and therefore in this ca&s;e their accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation or of a&s;&s;ociation is &s;lowly produced,
<PB N="549" REF="5570">
and a long fever &s;upervenes in con&s;equence; or &s;udden death, as fre|quently happens, terminates the cold fit.</P>
<P>Whence it appears, that in fevers with weak pul&s;e, if the action of the heart, arteries, and capillaries could be dimini&s;hed, or &s;topped for a &s;hort time without occa&s;ioning the death of the patient, as happens in cold bathing, or to per&s;ons apparently drowned, that a great accu|mulation of the &s;en&s;orial powers of irritation or of a&s;&s;ociation might &s;oon be produced, and the pul&s;e become &s;tronger, and con&s;equently &s;lower, and the fever cea&s;e. Hence cold ablution may be of &s;ervice in fevers with weak pul&s;e, by preventing the expenditure and pro|ducing accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation or a&s;&s;ociation. Stupor may be u&s;eful on the &s;ame account. Could a centrifugal &s;wing be &s;erviceable for this purpo&s;e, either by placing the head or the feet in the outward part of the circle, as de&s;cribed in Art. 15. 7. of this Supplement?</P>

<HEAD><HI>IV.</HI> Return of the cold Fit.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. If the increa&s;ed action of the cutaneous and pulmonary capil|laries, and of the heart and arteries, in febris irritativa continues long and with violence, a proportional expenditure or exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;o|rial power occurs; which by its tendency to induce torpor of &s;ome part, or of the whole, brings on a return of the cold fit.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another cau&s;e which contributes to induce torpor of the whole &s;y&s;tem by the &s;ympathy of its parts with each other, is the remaining torpor of &s;ome vi&s;cus; which after the la&s;t cold paroxy&s;m had not re|covered it&s;elf, as of the &s;pleen, liver, kidnies, or of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, or ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, as above mentioned.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="550" REF="5580">
3. Other cau&s;es are the deficiency of the natural &s;timuli, as hunger, thir&s;t, and want of fre&s;h air. Other cau&s;es are great fatigue, want of re&s;t, fear, grief, or anxiety of mind. And la&s;tly, the influence of external ethereal fluids, as the defect of external heat, and of &s;olar or lunar gravitation. Of the latter the return of the paroxy&s;ms of con|tinued fevers about &s;ix o'clock in the evening, when the &s;olar gravitation is the lea&s;t, affords an example of the influence of it; and the u&s;ual periods of intermittents, whether quotidian, tertian, or quartan, which &s;o regularly obey &s;olar or lunar days, afford in&s;tances of the influence of tho&s;e luminaries on the&s;e kinds of fevers.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the tendency to torpor of &s;ome vi&s;cus is con&s;iderable, this will be increa&s;ed at the time, when the terrene gravitation is greate&s;t, as explained in the introduction to Cla&s;s IV. 2. 4. and may either produce a cold paroxy&s;m of quotidian fever; or it may not yet be &s;ufficient in quantity for that purpo&s;e, but may neverthele&s;s become greater, and continue &s;o till the next period of the greate&s;t terrene gravitation, and may then either produce a paroxy&s;m of tertian fever; or may &s;till become greater, and continue &s;o till the next period of greate&s;t terrene gravitation, and then produce a paroxy&s;m of quartan ague. And la&s;tly, the periodical times of the&s;e paroxy&s;ms may exceed, or fall &s;hort of, the time of greate&s;t diurnal terrene gra|vitation according to the time of day, or period of the moon, in which the fir&s;t fit began; that is, whether the diurnal terrene gravitation was then in an increa&s;ing or decrea&s;ing &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD><HI>V.</HI> Sen&s;ation excited in Fever.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A curious ob&s;ervation is related by Dr. Fordyce in his Tract on Simple fever, page 168. He a&s;&s;erts, that tho&s;e people, who have been confined &s;ome time in a very warm atmo&s;phere, as of 120 or 130 degrees of heat, do not feel cold, nor are &s;ubject to palene&s;s of their &s;kins, on coming into a temperature of 30 or 40 degrees; which would produce great palene&s;s and painful &s;en&s;ation of coldne&s;s in tho&s;e, who had been &s;ome time confined in an atmo&s;phere of only 86 or 90 degrees. Analogous to this, an ob&s;erving friend of mine a&s;&s;ured me, that once having &s;at up to a very late hour with three or four very in|genious and humorous companions, and drank a con&s;iderable quantity of wine; both contrary to his u&s;ual habits of life; and being obliged to ri&s;e early, and to ride a long journey on the next day; he expected to have found him&s;elf weak and &s;oon fatigued; but on the contrary he performed his journey with unu&s;ual ea&s;e and alacrity; and fre|quently laughed, as he rode, at the wit of the preceding evening. In both the&s;e ca&s;es a degree of pain or plea&s;ure actuated the &s;y&s;tem; and thus a &s;en&s;orial power, that of &s;en&s;ation, was &s;uperadded to that of ir|ritation, or volition. See Sect. XXXIV. 2. 6.</P>
<P N="2">2. Similar to this, when the energetic exertions of &s;ome parts of the &s;y&s;tem in the hot fit of fever ari&s;e to a certain exce&s;s, a degree of &s;en&s;ation is produced; as of heat, which particularly increa&s;es the actions of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els, which are more liable to be excited by this &s;timulus. When this additional &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation exi&s;ts to a greater degree, the pul&s;e, which was before full, now be|comes hard, owing to the inflammation of the va&s;a va&s;orum, or coats of the arteries. In the&s;e ca&s;es, whether there is any topical inflam|mation or not, the fever cea&s;es to intermit; but neverthele&s;s there
<PB N="552" REF="5600">
are daily remi&s;&s;ions and exacerbations of it; which recur for the mo&s;t part about &s;ix in the evening, when the &s;olar gravitation is the lea&s;t, as mentioned in Sect. XXXVI. 3. 7.</P>
<P N="3">3. Thus the introduction of another &s;en&s;orial power, that of &s;en|&s;ation, converts an intermittent fever into a continued one. If it be attended with &s;trong pul&s;e, it is termed febris &s;en&s;itiva irritata, or py|rexia, or inflammation; if with a weak pul&s;e, it is termed febris &s;en|&s;itiva inirritata, or typhus gravior, $r malignant fever. The &s;eat of the inflammation is in the glandular or capillary &s;y&s;tem, as it con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ecretion of new fluids, or new fibres, which form new ve&s;&s;els, as they harden, like the &s;ilk of the &s;ilk-worm. See Art. 15. of this Supplement.</P>

<HEAD><HI>VI.</HI> Circles of irritative A&s;&s;ociate Motions.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. There are &s;ome a&s;&s;ociate motions, which are perpetually pro|ceeding in our waking hours, and are catenated by their fir&s;t link, or in &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent parts of the chain, with the &s;timuli or the influ|ence of external things; which we &s;hall here enumerate, as they contribute to the knowledge of fever. Of the&s;e are the irritative ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions of the organs of &s;en&s;e, and the mu&s;cular motions a&s;&s;ociated with them; which, when the chain is di&s;turbed or interrupted, excite the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation, and proceed in confu&s;ion. Thus if the irritative ideas of &s;ight are di&s;turbed, the pa|ralactic motions of objects, which in general are unperceived, become &s;en&s;ible to us; and the locomotive mu&s;cles a&s;&s;ociated with them, which ought to pre&s;erve the body erect, &s;tagger from this decrea&s;e or interruption of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; and vertigo is produced.</P>
<P><PB N="553" REF="5610">
When the irritative &s;en&s;ual motions, or ideas, belonging to one &s;en&s;e are increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed, the irritative &s;en&s;ual motions, or ideas, of the other &s;en&s;es are liable to become di&s;turbed by their ge|neral catenations; whence occur noi&s;es in the ears, bad ta&s;tes in the mouth, bad odours, and numbne&s;s or tingling of the limbs, as a greater or le&s;s number of &s;en&s;es are affected. The&s;e con&s;titute con|comitant circles of di&s;turbed irritative ideas; or make a part of the great circle of irritative ideas, or motions of the organs of &s;en&s;e; and when thus di&s;turbed occa&s;ion many kinds of hallucination of our other &s;en&s;es, or attend on the vertigo of vi&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another great circle of irritative a&s;&s;ociated motions con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e of the alimentary canal; which are catenated with &s;timuli or with influences external to the &s;y&s;tem, but continue to be exerted in our &s;leeping as well as in our waking hours. When the&s;e a&s;&s;o|ciations of motion are di&s;turbed by the too great or too &s;mall &s;timulus of the food taken into the &s;tomach, or by the too great exce&s;s or de|privation of heat, or by indige&s;tible &s;ub&s;tances, or by torpor or orga&s;m occa&s;ioned by their a&s;&s;ociation with other parts, various di&s;ea&s;es are induced under the names of apep&s;ia, hypochondria&s;is, hy&s;teria, diarr|hoea, cholera, ileus, nephritis, fever.</P>
<P N="3">3. A third circle of irritative a&s;&s;ociate motions con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem; which may be divided into two, the lacteals, and the lymphatics. When the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines are recently filled with food and fluid, the lacteal &s;y&s;tem is &s;timulated into great action; at the &s;ame time the cellular, cutaneous, and pulmonary lymphatics act with le&s;s energy; becau&s;e le&s;s fluid is then wanted from tho&s;e branches, and becau&s;e more &s;en&s;orial power is expended by the lacteal branch. On this account the&s;e two &s;y&s;tems of ab|&s;orbents are liable to act by rever&s;e &s;ympathy; hence pale urine is made after a full dinner, as le&s;s of the aqueous part of it is imbibed by
<PB N="554" REF="5620">
the urinary lymphatics; and hence the water in ana&s;arca of the lungs and limbs is &s;peedily ab&s;orbed, when the actions of the lacteals of the &s;tomach or inte&s;tines are weakened or inverted by the exhibition of tho&s;e drugs, which produce nau&s;ea, or by violent vomiting, or vio|lent cathartics.</P>
<P>Hence in diabetes the lacteal &s;y&s;tem acts &s;trongly, at the &s;ame time that the urinary lymphatics invert their motions, and tran&s;mit the chyle into the bladder; and in diarrhoea from crapula, or too great a quantity of food and fluid taken at a time, the lacteals act &s;trongly, and ab&s;orb chyle or fluids from the &s;tomach and upper in|te&s;tines; while the lymphatics of the lower inte&s;tines revert their motions, and tran&s;mit this over-repletion into the lower inte&s;tines, and thus produce diarrhoea; which accounts for the &s;peedy operation of &s;ome cathartic drugs, when much fluid is taken along with them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Other circles of irritative a&s;&s;ociate motions of great importance are tho&s;e of the &s;ecerning &s;y&s;tem; of the&s;e are the motions of the larger congeries of glands, which form the liver, &s;pleen, pancreas, ga&s;tric glands, kidneys, &s;alivary glands, and many others; &s;ome of which act by direct and others by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with each other. Thus when the ga&s;tric glands act mo&s;t powerfully, as when the &s;tomach is filled with food, the kidneys act with le&s;s energy; as is &s;hewn by the &s;mall &s;ecretion of urine for the fir&s;t hour or two after dinner; which rever&s;e &s;ympathy is occa&s;ioned by the greater expen|diture of &s;en&s;orial power on the ga&s;tric glands, and to the newly ab|&s;orbed fluids not yet being &s;ufficiently animalized, or otherwi&s;e prepared, to &s;timulate the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the kidneys.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e very exten&s;ive glands, which &s;ecrete the per&s;pirable matter of the &s;kin and lungs, with the mucus, which lubricates all the internal cells and cavities of the body, claim our particular atten|tion. The&s;e glands, as well as all the others, proceed from the capillary
<PB N="555" REF="5630">
ve&s;&s;els, which unite the arteries with the veins, and are not properly a part of them; the mucous and per&s;pirative glands, which ari&s;e from the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries, are a&s;&s;ociated by direct &s;ympathy; as appears from immer&s;ion in the cold bath, which is therefore attended with a temporary difficult re&s;piration; while tho&s;e from the capillaries of the &s;tomach and heart and arteries are more generally a&s;&s;ociated by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the cu|taneous capillaries; as appears in fevers with weak pul&s;e and indi|ge&s;tion, and at the &s;ame time with a hot and dry &s;kin.</P>
<P>The di&s;turbed actions of this circle of the a&s;&s;ociate motions of the &s;ecerning &s;y&s;tem, when the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation is added to that of irritation, frequently produces inflammation, which con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ecretion of new fluids or new ve&s;&s;els. Neverthele&s;s, if the&s;e di&s;turbed actions be of the torpid kind, the pain, which attends them, is &s;eldom productive of inflammation, as in hemicrania; but is liable to excite voluntary actions, and thus to expend much &s;en&s;orial power, as in the &s;huddering in cold fits of fever, or in convul&s;ions; or la&s;tly the pain it&s;elf, which attends torpid actions, is liable to expend or exhau&s;t much &s;en&s;orial power without producing any increa&s;ed actions; whence the low pul&s;e, and cold extremities, which u&s;ually attend hemicrania; and hence when inert, or inactive &s;en&s;ation at|tends one link of a&s;&s;ociated action, the &s;ucceeding link is generally rendered torpid, as a coldne&s;s of the cheek attends tooth-ach.</P>
<P N="5">5. A fifth important circle of irritative motions is that of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem, in which the capillary ve&s;&s;els are to be included, which unite the arterial and venous &s;y&s;tems, both pulmonary and aortal. The di&s;turbed action of this &s;y&s;tem of the heart and arteries, and capillaries, con&s;titute &s;imple fever; to which may be added, that the &s;ecerning and ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els appending to the capillaries, and the bibulous mouths of the veins, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure at the &s;ame time generally affected.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="556" REF="5640">
6. Now, though the links of each of the&s;e circles of irritative motions are more &s;trictly a&s;&s;ociated together, yet are they in greater or le&s;s degree a&s;&s;ociated or catenated with each other by direct or rever&s;e &s;ympathy. Thus the &s;ickne&s;s, or inverted irritative motions of the &s;tomach, are a&s;&s;ociated or catenated with the di&s;turbed irrita|tive ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions, in vertigo; as in &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s. This &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach is al&s;o a&s;&s;ociated or catenated with the torpor of the heart and arteries by direct &s;ympathy, and with the capillaries and ab&s;orbents by rever&s;e &s;ympathy; and are thus all of them liable occa&s;ionally to be di&s;turbed, when one of them is di&s;ea&s;ed; and con|&s;titute the great variety of the kinds or &s;ymptoms of fevers.</P>

<HEAD><HI>VII.</HI> Alternation of the cold and hot Fits.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. When any cau&s;e occurs, which dimini&s;hes to a certain degree the &s;upply of &s;en&s;orial power in re&s;pect to the whole &s;y&s;tem; as &s;up|po&s;e a temporary inexertion of the brain; what happens? Fir&s;t, tho&s;e motions are exerted with le&s;s energy, which are not imme|diately nece&s;&s;ary to life, as the locomotive mu&s;cles; and tho&s;e ideas, which are generally excited by volition; at the &s;ame time this defi|ciency of voluntary motion is different from that which occurs in &s;leep; as in that the movements of the arterial &s;y&s;tem are increa&s;ed in energy though not in frequency. Next, the motions of the ali|mentary canal become performed with le&s;s energy, or cea&s;e alto|gether; and a total want of appetite to &s;olid food occurs, or &s;ickne&s;s, or a diarrhoea occa&s;ioned by the indige&s;ted aliment. Then the ab|&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els cea&s;e to act with their due energy; whence thir&s;t, and pale urine, though in &s;mall quantities. Fourthly, the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els become affected by the general diminution of &s;en&s;orial power; whence all the &s;ecreted fluids are produced in le&s;s quantity. And la&s;tly, the &s;angui&s;erous canals feel the general torpor; the pul&s;ations
<PB N="557" REF="5650">
of the heart and arteries become feeble, and con&s;equently quick; and the capillaries of the &s;kin become inactive, acquire le&s;s blood from the arteries, and are con&s;equently paler and &s;hrunk.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t circum&s;tance of the torpor of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem con&s;i&s;ts inirritative fever; as all the others are rather accidental or concomitant &s;ymptoms, and not e&s;&s;ential ones; as fewer or more of them may be pre&s;ent, or may exi&s;t with a greater or le&s;s degree of inactivity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now as the capillaries of the &s;kin are expo&s;ed to greater va|rieties of heat and cold, than the heart and arteries, they are &s;up|po&s;ed to be more mobile, that is, more &s;u&s;ceptible of torpor or exertion, or to inflammation, by external &s;timuli or influences, than the other parts of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem; and as the &s;kin is more &s;en&s;ible to the pre&s;ence of heat, than the internal parts of the body, the commencement of the cold paroxy&s;ms of fever generally either fir&s;t exi&s;ts in, or is fir&s;t perceived by, the coldne&s;s and palene&s;s of the &s;kin; and the commencement of the hot fits by the heat and redne&s;s of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power occurs in the&s;e organs &s;oone&s;t, and in greate&s;t quantity, during their quie&s;cence, which were mo&s;t perpetually in action during health; hence tho&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem &s;oone&s;t recover from torpor in intermittent fever, and &s;oone&s;t fall into the contrary extreme of increa&s;ed activity; as the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem of the heart and arteries and capillaries. But of the&s;e the capillaries &s;eem fir&s;t to acquire a renovation of their action, as the heat of the &s;kin becomes fir&s;t renewed, as well as increa&s;ed beyond its natural quantity, and this in &s;ome parts &s;ooner than in others; which quantity of heat is however not to be e&s;timated &s;imply by the ri&s;e of the mercury in the thermometer, but al&s;o by the quan|tity carried away into the atmo&s;phere, or diffu&s;ed among&s;t other
<PB N="558" REF="5660">
bodies in a given time; as more heat pa&s;&s;es through water, which boils vehemently, than when it boils gently, though the ri&s;e of the thermometer in both ca&s;es continues the &s;ame. This fact may be known by boiling an egg in water, the white of which coagulates in much le&s;s time, if the water boils vehemently, than if it boils moderately, though the &s;en&s;ible heat of the water is the &s;ame in both ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e, which induces the cutaneous capillaries to renew their actions &s;ooner than the heart and arteries after imme$&s;ion in the cold bath, is, that their torpor was occa&s;ioned by defect of irritation; whereas that of the heart and arteries was occa&s;ioned by defect of a&s;&s;ociation; which defect of a&s;&s;ociation was owing to the decrea&s;ed actions of the capillaries, and is now again excited by their renewed action; which excitement mu&s;t therefore be &s;ub&s;equent to that in|crea&s;ed action of the capillaries; and in con&s;equence the increa&s;ed action of the heart and arteries at the commencement of the hot fit of &s;ome fevers is &s;ub&s;equent to the increa&s;ed action of the cutaneous capillaries. There is, however, in this ca&s;e an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in the heart and arteries, which mu&s;t contribute to increa&s;e their orga&s;m in the hot fit, as well as the in|crea&s;ed excitement of it by the increa&s;ed action of the capillaries.</P>
<P N="4">4. Now this increa&s;ed action of the &s;y&s;tem, during the hot fit, by exhau&s;ting the &s;en&s;orial powers of irritation and a&s;&s;ociation, contri|butes to induce a renewal of the cold paroxy&s;m; as the accumulation of tho&s;e &s;en&s;orial powers in the cold fit produces the increa&s;ed actions of the hot fit; which two &s;tates of the &s;y&s;tem reciprocally induce each other by a kind of libration, or a plus and minus, of the &s;en&s;orial powers of irritation and a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>If the exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power during the hot fit of fever only reduces the quantity of irritability and a&s;&s;ociability to its natural &s;tandard, the fever is cured, not being liable to return. If the
<PB N="559" REF="5670">
quantity of the&s;e &s;en&s;orial powers be reduced only &s;o much, as not to produce a &s;econd cold fit during the pre&s;ent quantity of external &s;timuli or influences; yet it may be &s;o far reduced, that a very &s;mall &s;ubtraction of &s;timulus, or of influence, may again induce a cold fit; &s;uch as the coldne&s;s of the night-air, or the diminution of &s;olar or lunar gravitation, as in intermittent fevers.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another cau&s;e of the renovation of the cold fits of fever is from &s;ome parts of the &s;y&s;tem not having completely recovered from the former cold paroxy&s;m; as happens to the &s;pleen, liver, or other in|ternal vi&s;cus; which &s;ometimes remains tumid, and either occa&s;ions a return of the cold fit by direct &s;ympathy with other parts of the body, or by its own want of action cau&s;es a diminution of the general quantity of heat, and thus facilitates the renovation of the torpor of the whole &s;y&s;tem, and gives cau&s;e to intermittent fevers catenated with lunar or &s;olar influence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8">
<HEAD><HI>VIII.</HI> Orga&s;m of the Capillaries.</HEAD>
<P>As the remaining torpor of &s;ome le&s;s e&s;&s;ential part of the &s;y&s;tem, as of the &s;pleen, when the hot fit cea&s;es, produces after one, two, or three days a return of cold fit by direct &s;ympathy with the cutaneous capillaries, when joined with &s;ome other cau&s;e of torpor, as the de|fect of &s;olar or lunar influences, or the expo&s;ure to cold or hunger, and thus gives origin to intermittent fever; &s;o the remaining torpor of &s;ome more e&s;&s;ential parts of the &s;y&s;tem, as of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, is probably the cau&s;e of the immediate recurrence of the cold paroxy&s;m, at the time the hot one cea&s;es, by their direct &s;ym|pathy with the cutaneous capillaries, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other cau&s;e of torpor; and thus produces remittent fever. And la&s;tly the remaining torpor of &s;ome &s;till more e&s;&s;ential parts of the
<PB N="560" REF="5680">
&s;y&s;tem, as the heart and arteries, after the hot fit ought to cea&s;e, is liable by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with the cutaneous capillaries to continue their orga&s;m, and thus to render a fever continual, which would otherwi&s;e remit or intermit.</P>
<P>Many difficulties here occur, which we &s;hall endeavour to throw &s;ome light upon, and leave to future inve&s;tigation; ob&s;erving only hat difficulties were to be expected, otherwi&s;e fevers would long &s;ince have been under&s;tood, as they have employed the unremitted attention of the phy&s;icians of all ages of the world.</P>
<P N="1">1. Why do the &s;ame parts of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive trains of action &s;ometimes affect each other by direct, and &s;ometimes by rever&s;e &s;ympathy?&mdash;1&s;t, When any irritative motion cea&s;es, or becomes torpid, which was before in perpetual action; it is either deprived of its u&s;ual &s;timulus, and thence the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation is not excited; or it has been previou&s;ly too much &s;timulated, and the &s;en&s;orial power has been thus exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>In the former ca&s;e an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power &s;oon occurs, which is excitable by a renewal of the &s;timulus; as when the fingers, which have been immer&s;ed &s;ome time in &s;now, are again expo&s;ed to the u&s;ual warmth of a room. Or, &s;econdly, the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation becomes &s;o much accumulated, that the motions, which were torpid, are now performed by le&s;s &s;timulus than natural; as appears by the warmth, which &s;oon occurs after the fir&s;t chill in going into fro&s;ty air, or into the bath at Buxton, which is about eighty degrees of heat. Or, la&s;tly, this accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation &s;o far abounds, that it increa&s;es the action of the next link of the a&s;&s;ociated train or tribe of motions; thus on expo&s;ing the &s;kin to cold air, as in walking out in a fro&s;ty morning, the actions of the &s;tomach are increa&s;ed, and dige&s;tion &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>But where the torpor of &s;ome irritative motion is owing to the previous exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation by too great
<PB N="561" REF="5690">
&s;timulus, the re&s;toration of it occurs either not at all, or much more &s;lowly than in the former in&s;tances; thus after intoxication the &s;tomach is very &s;low in recovering its due quantity of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, and never &s;hews any accumulation of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. When an a&s;&s;ociate motion, as de&s;cribed in the introduction to Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. acts with le&s;s energy, the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;oci|ation is either not &s;ufficiently excited by the preceding fibrous mo|tions; or it has been expended or exhau&s;ted by the too violent actions of the preceding fibrous motions. In the former ca&s;e there occurs an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; exactly as, where the u&s;ual &s;timulus is withdrawn, there occurs an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation. Thus when the actions of the capillaries of the &s;kin are dimini&s;hed by immer&s;ion in cold water, the capillaries of the lungs are rendered torpid by the want of the excite|ment of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, owing to the le&s;&s;ened actions of the previous fibrous motions, namely, of tho&s;e of the &s;kin. Neverthele&s;s as &s;oon as the capillaries of the &s;kin regain their in|crea&s;ed activity by the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irrita|tion, the&s;e capillaries of the lungs act with greater energy al&s;o owing to their accumulated &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation. The&s;e are in|&s;tances of direct &s;ympathy, and con&s;titute the cold and hot paroxy&s;ms of intermittent fever; or the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m of a continued one.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the fir&s;t link of a train of a&s;&s;ociated motions, which is &s;ubject to perpetual action, becomes a con&s;iderable time torpid for want of being excited by the previous exertions of the irritative mo|tions, with which it is catenated; the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation becomes accumulated in &s;o great a degree as to affect the &s;econd link of the train of a&s;&s;ociated motions, and to excite it into &s;tronger action. Thus when the &s;tomach is rendered torpid by contagious matter &s;wallowed into it mixed with the &s;aliva, the heart and arteries
<PB N="562" REF="5700">
act more feebly; becau&s;e the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which u&s;ed to be excited by the fibrous motions of the &s;tomach, is not now excited; and in con&s;equence the motions of the heart and arteries act only by the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, which is excited by the &s;timulus of the blood.</P>
<P>But during this torpor of the &s;tomach, and le&s;s action of the heart and arteries, &s;o great an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial powers of irritation and of a&s;&s;ociation occurs, that it adds to the action of the next link of this vital circle of actions, that is, to that of the cuta|neous capillaries. Whence in this &s;ituation the torpor of the &s;to|mach occa&s;ions a dimini&s;hed action of the heart and arteries by direct &s;ympathy, and may be &s;aid to occa&s;ion an increa&s;ed one of the cuta|neous capillaries by rever&s;e &s;ympathy; which con&s;titute continued fever with weak pul&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor is this increa&s;ed action of the capillaries in con&s;equence of the decrea&s;ed action of the heart and arteries, as in fevers with weak pul&s;e, a &s;ingle fact in the animal economy; though it exi&s;ts in this ca&s;e in the greate&s;t degree or duration, becau&s;e the heart and arteries are perpetually in greater action than any other part of the &s;y&s;tem. But a &s;imilar circum&s;tance occurs, when the &s;tomach is rendered in|active by defective excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, as in &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, or in nephritis. In the&s;e ca&s;es the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation becomes much accumulated in the &s;tomach, and &s;eems by its &s;uperabundance to excite the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem, which is &s;o nearly connected with it, into great increa&s;e of action; as is known by the great quantity frequently in the&s;e &s;ituations rejected by vomit, which could not otherways be &s;upplied. It is probable the increa&s;e of dige&s;tion by walking in fro&s;ty air, with many other animal facts, may by future ob&s;ervations be found to be dependent on this principle, as well as the increa&s;ed action of the capillaries in continued fevers with weak pul&s;e.</P>
<P>Whereas in continued fever with &s;trong pul&s;e, which may perhaps
<PB N="563" REF="5710">
occur &s;ometimes on the fir&s;t day even of the plague, the &s;tomach with the heart and arteries and the capillaries act by direct &s;ympathy; that is, the &s;tomach is excited into &s;tronger action by increa&s;ed irritation owing to the &s;timulus of contagious matter; the&s;e &s;tronger irritative motions of the &s;tomach excite a greater quantity of the &s;en|&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which then actuates the heart and arte|ries with greater energy, as the&s;e are catenated with the &s;tomach; and in the &s;ame manner the increa&s;ed actions of the heart and arte|ries excite a greater quantity of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which actuates the cutaneous capillaries with increa&s;e of energy. See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1.</P>
<P N="4">4. I &s;hall dwell a little longer on this intricate &s;ubject. The com|mencement of fever-fits is known by the inactivity of the cutaneous capillaries, which inactivity is ob&s;ervable by the palene&s;s and coldne&s;s of the &s;kin, and al&s;o by the pain of coldne&s;s, which attends it. There is neverthele&s;s in mo&s;t ca&s;es, except tho&s;e which are owing to expo&s;ure to external cold, a torpor of the capillaries of &s;ome internal vi&s;cus preceding this inactivity of the cutaneous capillaries; which is known by the tumour or hardne&s;s of the vi&s;cus, or by an aching pain of it. The capillaries of the lungs are at the &s;ame time rendered inactive or torpid, as appears by the difficulty of breathing, and coldne&s;s of the breath in cold fits of fever, and in going into the cold bath; but the lungs are not affected with the pain either of coldne&s;s or of torpor.</P>
<P>One cau&s;e of this &s;ynchronous or &s;ucce&s;&s;ive inactivity of the cu|taneous capillaries, in con&s;equence of the previous torpor of &s;ome in|ternal vi&s;cus, may be owing to the deficiency of heat; which mu&s;t occur, when any part becomes inactive; becau&s;e the &s;ecretions of that part cea&s;e or are le&s;&s;ened, and the quantity of heat of it in con|&s;equence. But the principal cau&s;e of it I &s;uppo&s;e to be owing to the defect of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; which power of
<PB N="564" REF="5720">
a&s;&s;ociation is excited by &s;ome previous or concomitant motions of the parts of every great circle of actions. This appears on going into the cold bath, becau&s;e the &s;hortne&s;s of breath in&s;tantly occurs, &s;ooner than one can conceive the diminution of the heat of the &s;kin could affect the lungs by the want of its &s;timulus; but not &s;ooner than the defect of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation could affect them; becau&s;e this mu&s;t cea&s;e to be excited into action on the in|&s;tant that the cutaneous capillaries cea&s;e to act; whence in the fir&s;t moment of contact of the cold water the cutaneous capillaries cea&s;e to act from defect of irritation; which is cau&s;ed by defect of the &s;timulus of heat; and in the &s;econd moment the capillaries of the lungs cea&s;e to act from the defect of a&s;&s;ociation; which is cau&s;ed by the defect of the motions of the cutaneous capillaries. Thus the univer&s;al torpor in the cold paroxy&s;m of fever is an example of direct &s;ympathy, though occa&s;ioned in part by defect of irritation, and in part by defect of a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P N="5">5. Thus in walking out in a fro&s;ty morning the &s;kin is cooled by the contact of the cold air, whence the actions of its capillaries are dimini&s;hed for want of their u&s;ual &s;timulus of heat to excite a &s;uffi|cient quantity of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation. Hence there is at fir&s;t a &s;aving of &s;en&s;orial power of irritation for the purpo&s;e of actuating the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem with greater energy. Secondly the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which u&s;ed to be excited by the motions of the cutaneous capillaries, is now not &s;o powerfully ex|cited; and in con&s;equence the parts, which con&s;titute the next links of the circles of a&s;&s;ociated motions, are for a time actuated with le&s;s energy, and a temporary general chillne&s;s &s;ucceeds; which is &s;o far &s;imilar to the cold fit of intermittent fever.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation there is a curious circum&s;tance occurs, which me|rits peculiar attention: after a &s;hort time, though the external &s;kin continues cool by its expo&s;ure to the cold air, and the actions of its
<PB N="565" REF="5730">
capillaries are con&s;equently dimini&s;hed, yet the capillaries of the &s;tomach act with greater energy; as is known by increa&s;ed dige&s;tion and con&s;equent hunger. This is to be a&s;cribed to the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, which now excites by its &s;uper|abundance, or overflowing, as it were, the &s;tomach into increa&s;ed action; though it is at the &s;ame time excited le&s;s powerfully than u&s;ual by the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation. Thus the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation in the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin increa&s;es in this ca&s;e the action of the &s;tomach, in the &s;ame manner as an ac|cumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in the heart and arteries in fevers with weak pul&s;e increa&s;es the action of the capillaries.</P>
<P>If neverthele&s;s the coldne&s;s of the &s;kin be too long continued, or exi&s;ts in too great a degree, &s;o as in &s;ome mea&s;ure to impair the life of the part, no further accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irri|tation occurs; and in con&s;equence the actions of the &s;tomach become le&s;s than natural by the defect of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; which has cea&s;ed to be excited by the want of action of the cutaneous capillaries. Whence continued coldne&s;s of the feet is accompanied with indige&s;tion and heartburn. See Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 6.</P>
<P N="6">6. Similar to this when the actions of the &s;tomach are rendered torpid by the previous &s;timulus of a violent emetic, and its motions become retrograde in con&s;equence, a great quantity of &s;en&s;orial power is exerted on the lymphatics of the lungs, and other parts of the body; which excites them into greater direct action, as is evinced by the exhibition of digitalis in ana&s;arca. In this &s;ituation I &s;uppo&s;e the emetic drug &s;timulates the mu&s;cular fibres of the &s;tomach into too great action; and that in con&s;equence a great torpor &s;oon &s;ucceeds; and that this inaction of the mu&s;cular parts of the &s;tomach is not fol|lowed by much accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation; becau&s;e that &s;en&s;orial power is in great mea&s;ure exhau&s;ted by the
<PB N="566" REF="5740">
previous exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus. But the lymphatics of the &s;tomach have their actions le&s;&s;ened by defect of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;o|ciation, which is not now excited into action, owing to the le&s;&s;ened motions of the mu&s;cular parts of it, with which the lymphatics are a&s;&s;ociated. The &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation becomes therefore ac|cumulated in the&s;e lymphatics of the &s;tomach, becau&s;e it is not excited into action; exactly as the power of irritation becomes accu|mulated in the hand, when immer&s;ed in &s;now; and this accumulated &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation excites the lymphatic of the lungs and of other parts, which are mo&s;t nearly a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, into more energetic actions. Thus the mu&s;cular fibres of the &s;tomach act with the lymphatics of that organ in direct &s;ympathy; and the lymphatics of the &s;tomach act in rever&s;e &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the lungs and of other parts of the body; the former of which is cau&s;ed by defect of the excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, and the latter by the accumulation of it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the efficient cau&s;e, as above explained, the final cau&s;e, or convenience, of the&s;e organic actions are worthy our attention. In this ca&s;e of an acrid drug &s;wallowed into the &s;tomach the reverted actions of the mu&s;cular fibres of the &s;tomach tend to eject its enemy; the reverted actions of its lymphatics pour a great quantity of fluids into the &s;tomach for the purpo&s;e of diluting or wa&s;hing off the noxious drug; and the increa&s;ed actions of the other lymphatics &s;up|ply the&s;e retrograde ones of the &s;tomach with an inconceivable &s;upply of fluids, as is &s;een in Ileus and Cholera.</P>
<P N="7">7. The inqui&s;itive reader will excu&s;e my continuing this &s;ubject, though perhaps with &s;ome repetitions, as it envelopes the very e&s;&s;ence of fever. When the fir&s;t link of a train of actions is excited by ex|ce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus, or exce&s;&s;ive irritability, and thus acts with unu&s;ual energy by the increa&s;ed quantity of irritation, the&s;e increa&s;ed mo|tions excite a greater quantity of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation,
<PB N="567" REF="5750">
which cau&s;es increa&s;ed motions in the &s;econd link, which is catenated with the fir&s;t; and then the exce&s;&s;ive action of this &s;econd link ex|cites al&s;o a greater quantity of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which increa&s;es the motions of the third link of this chain of a&s;&s;o|ciation, and thus the increa&s;e of the &s;timulus on the irritative mo|tions, to which the chain of a&s;&s;ociation is catenated, increa&s;es the action of the whole chain or circle of a&s;&s;ociated motions.</P>
<P>After a time the irritative motions become torpid by expenditure of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, and then the power of a&s;&s;ociation al&s;o becomes le&s;s exerted, both becau&s;e it has been in part exhau&s;ted by too great action, and is now le&s;s excited by the le&s;&s;ened action of the irritative motions, which u&s;ed to excite it. The&s;e are both in|&s;tances of direct &s;ympathy, and frequently con&s;titute the cold and hot fit of intermittents.</P>
<P>But though the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation during the quie&s;cence of &s;ome motion owing to want of &s;timulus generally induces torpor in the fir&s;t link of the train of a&s;&s;ociated motions catenated with it; as the capillaries of the lungs become torpid immediately on immer&s;ion of the &s;kin into cold water; yet in &s;ome &s;ituations an orga&s;m or exce&s;s of action is produced in the fir&s;t link of the a&s;&s;ociated motions thus catenated with irritative ones; as in the increa&s;ed action of the &s;tomach, when the &s;kin is for a time ex|po&s;ed to cold air; which may in part be a&s;cribed to the general increa&s;e of action of the whole &s;y&s;tem, owing to the dimini&s;hed expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power, but particularly of the parts, which have habitually acted together; as when one arm is paralytic the other is liable to more frequent or almo&s;t continual motion; and when one eye becomes blind the other frequently becomes &s;tronger; which is well known to farriers, who are &s;aid &s;ometimes to de&s;troy the &s;ight of one eye to &s;trengthen that of the other in di&s;ea&s;ed hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Hence there is &s;ometimes a direct &s;ympathy, and &s;ometimes a
<PB N="568" REF="5760">
rever&s;e one &s;ucceeds the torpor occa&s;ioned by defect of &s;timulus, the latter of which is perhaps owing to a certain time being required for the production of an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation by the nervous branches of the torpid organ; which accumulation is now in part or entirely derived to the next link of the a&s;&s;ociation, Thus in going into a coldi&s;h bath, as into a river in the &s;ummer months, we at fir&s;t experience a difficulty of breathing from the torpid action of the pulmonary capillaries, owing to the deficient excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in con&s;equence of the torpor of the cutaneous capillaries. But in a very &s;hort time, as in one minute, the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation becomes accumulated by the inactivity of the cutaneous capillaries; and as its &s;uper|abundance becomes now expended on the pulmonary capillaries, the difficult re&s;piration cea&s;es; though the cutaneous capillaries continue torpid by their contact with the cold water, and con&s;equently the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which u&s;ed to contribute to actuate the pulmonary capillaries, is le&s;s excited.</P>
<P N="8">8. In like manner when there exi&s;ts an accumulation of the &s;en|&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, owing to defect of its excitement by &s;ome previous irritative or a&s;&s;ociate motions, it is generally accompanied for a certain time by a torpor not only of the link fir&s;t affected, but of the &s;ub&s;equent parts, or of the whole train of a&s;&s;ociated motions, as in the cold fits of intermittent fevers. Yet after a time an increa&s;ed action of the next links of a&s;&s;ociated motions &s;ucceeds the torpor of the fir&s;t, as the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the lungs act more violently in con&s;equence of the deficient action of tho&s;e of the &s;tomach; and the &s;kin at the commencement of &s;ickne&s;s is pale and cold, but in a little time becomes flu&s;hed and warm.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee in a&s;&s;ociate motions, which are rendered torpid by defect of excitement, that &s;ometimes a direct, and &s;ometimes a re|ver&s;e &s;ympathy &s;ucceeds in the &s;ub&s;equent links of the chain. But
<PB N="569" REF="5770">
I believe where a torpor of irritative or of the a&s;&s;ociate motions is cau&s;ed by a previous too great expenditure or exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;o|rial powers of irritation or a&s;&s;ociation, no increa&s;e of action in the &s;ub|&s;equent link ever occurs, or not till after a very long time.</P>
<P>Thus when the &s;tomach becomes torpid by previous violent exer|tion, and con&s;equent exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, as after intoxication with wine or opium, or after the exhibition of &s;ome violent emetic drug, the torpor is communicated to the heart and ar|teries, as in continued fevers with weak pul&s;e. But where the tor|por of the &s;tomach is produced from defective a&s;&s;ociation, as in &s;ea|&s;ickne&s;s; or in the &s;ickne&s;s which occurs, when a &s;tone &s;timulates the ureter; no torpor is then communicated to the heart and arteries. For in the former ca&s;e there is no accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the &s;tomach, which was previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted by too great &s;timulus; but in the latter ca&s;e the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power in the &s;to|mach during its torpor is evinced by this circum&s;tance; that in &s;ea|&s;ickne&s;s the patients eat and drink voraciou&s;ly at intervals; and the pul&s;e is generally not affected by the &s;ickne&s;s occa&s;ioned by a &s;tone in the ureter. For the action of the &s;tomach is then le&s;&s;ened, and in con&s;equence becomes retrograde, not owing to the exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, but to the want of excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; which is cau&s;ed by the defective action of the ureter, which becomes occa&s;ionally torpid by the great &s;timulus of the &s;tone it contains; or which is cau&s;ed by the great exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power by the pain; which affects the ureter without exciting inflammation, or increa&s;ed action of it.</P>
<P N="9">9. Thus though the &s;tomach after the great &s;timulus of intoxica|tion from exce&s;s of wine or opium will continue many hours without accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, as appears from the patient's experi|encing no appetite at the intervals of &s;ickne&s;s; yet after long ab&s;tinence from food, at length not only the exhau&s;ted quantity of &s;en&s;orial
<PB N="570" REF="5780">
power is renewed, but an accumulation of it at length occurs, and hunger returns. In this &s;ituation the &s;tomach is generally about a whole day before it regains its u&s;ual powers of dige&s;tion; but if it has been &s;till more violently &s;timulated, and its actions further impaired, a &s;till more permanent torpor along with a continued fever with weak pul&s;e is liable to occur; and a fourth part, or a half, or three fourths, or a whole lunar period pa&s;&s;es, before it recovers its due irritability and con&s;equent action.</P>
<P>In &s;imilar manner, after a per&s;on has been confined in a very warm room for &s;ome hours, the cutaneous capillaries, with their &s;ecretory and ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, become exhau&s;ted of their &s;en&s;orial power of ir|ritation by the too great violent exertions occa&s;ioned by the unu&s;ual &s;timulus of heat; and in coming into a colder atmo&s;phere an inactivity of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els exi&s;ts at fir&s;t for &s;ome time without accumu|lation of &s;en&s;orial power; as is &s;hewn by the continuance of the pain of cold and the palene&s;s; but after a time both the pain of cold and palene&s;s vani&s;h, which now indicates an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, as le&s;s degrees of heat &s;timulate the &s;y&s;tem into due action.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner, after any one has been &s;ome time in the &s;um|mer &s;un&s;hine, on coming into a dark cell he continues much longer before he can clearly di&s;tingui&s;h objects, than if his eyes had only been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to the light of a cloudy day in winter; becau&s;e the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, and con&s;equent &s;en&s;ation, had in the fir&s;t ca&s;e been previou&s;ly much expended or exhau&s;ted; and therefore re|quired a much longer time before it could be produced in the brain, or derived to the optic nerves, in &s;uch quantity as to re&s;tore the defi|ciency, and to cau&s;e an accumulation of it; whereas in the latter ca&s;e no deficiency had occurred.</P>
<P N="10">10. Thus the accumulation or deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power in a torpid organ, which had previou&s;ly been accu&s;tomed to perpetual action,
<PB N="571" REF="5790">
depends on the manner in which it becomes torpid; that is, whether by great previous &s;timulus, or great previous excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation; or by defect of its accu&s;tomed &s;timulus, or of its accu&s;tomed excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation. In the former ca&s;e the &s;en&s;orial power is in an exhau&s;ted &s;tate, and therefore is not likely to become &s;o &s;oon accumulated, as after drunkenne&s;s, or expo&s;ure to great heat, or to great light; in the latter a great accu|mulation of &s;en&s;orial power occurs, as after expo&s;ure to cold, or hun|ger, or darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Hence when the &s;tomach continues torpid by previous violent &s;ti|mulus, as in the exhibition of digitalis, no accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power of irritation &s;upervenes; and in con&s;equence the motions of the heart and arteries, which are a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, become weak, and &s;low, and intermittent, from the defect of the excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation. But what follows? as the actions of the heart and arteries are le&s;&s;ened by the deficient ac|tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, and not by previous increa&s;ed excitement of it; a great accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;o|ciation occurs, which is exerted on the pulmonary and cutaneous ab|&s;orbents by rever&s;e &s;ympathy, and produces a great ab&s;orption of the fluid effu&s;ed into the cellular membrane in ana&s;arca, with dry &s;kin; con&s;tituting one kind of atrophy.</P>
<P>But if at the &s;ame time the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tomach are &s;ti|mulated into &s;o violent activity as to induce great con&s;equent torpor, as probably happens when contagious matter is &s;wallowed into the &s;tomach with our &s;aliva, tho&s;e of the heart and arteries act feebly from the deficient excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation; and then the cutaneous and pulmonary &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els act with greater force than natural, owing to the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;|&s;ociation; and unnatural heat of the &s;kin, and of the breath &s;ucceed; but without frequency of pul&s;e, con&s;tituting the pare&s;is irritativa of Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 2. And la&s;tly, if a paucity of blood attends this pare&s;is,
<PB N="572" REF="5800">
or &s;ome other cau&s;e inducing a frequency of pul&s;e, the febris inirrita|tiva, or fever with weak pul&s;e, is produced.</P>
<P>But on the contrary when the &s;tomach has previou&s;ly been render|ed torpid by defect of &s;timulus, as by hunger, if food be too ha&s;tily &s;upplied, not only great exertion of the &s;tomach it&s;elf &s;ucceeds, but fever with &s;trong pul&s;e is induced in con&s;equence; that is, the heart and arteries are excited into more energetic action by the exce&s;s of the power of a&s;&s;ociation, which catenates their motions with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach. For the redundancy of &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, which was accumulated during the inactivity of the &s;tomach, and is now called into action by &s;timulus, actuates that organ with increa&s;ed energy, and excites by the&s;e increa&s;ed motions the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; which has al&s;o been accumulated during the inactivity of the heart and arteries; and thus the&s;e organs al&s;o are now excited into greater action.</P>
<P>So after the &s;kin has been expo&s;ed &s;ome hours to greater heat than natural in the warm room, other parts, as the membranes of the no&s;trils, or of the lungs, or of the &s;tomach, are liable to become tor|pid from direct &s;ympathy with it, when we come into air of a mode|rate temperature; whence catarrhs, coughs, and fevers. But if this torpor be occa&s;ioned by defect of &s;timulus, as after being expo&s;ed to fro&s;ty air, the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power is exerted, and a glow of the &s;kin follows, with increa&s;ed dige&s;tion, full re&s;piration, and more vigorous circulation.</P>
<P N="11">11. It may be a&s;ked, Why is there a great and con&s;tant accumula|tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, owing to the torpor of the &s;tomach and heart and arteries, in continued fever with weak pul&s;e; which is exerted on the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries, &s;o as to excite them into increa&s;ed action for many weeks, and yet no &s;uch exuberance of &s;en&s;orial power produces fever in winter-&s;leeping ani|mals, or in chloro&s;is, or apep&s;ia, or hy&s;teria?</P>
<P><PB N="573" REF="5810">
In winter-&s;leeping animals I &s;uppo&s;e the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem is torpid, or paraly&s;ed, as in the &s;leep of frozen people; and that the &s;tomach is torpid in con&s;equence of the inactivity or quie&s;cence of the brain; and that all other parts of the body, and the cutaneous capil|laries with the re&s;t, labour under a &s;imilar torpor.</P>
<P>In chloro&s;is, I imagine, the actions of the heart and arteries, as well as tho&s;e of the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries, &s;uffer along with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach from the deficient &s;timulus of the pale blood; and that though the liver is probably the &s;eat of the original torpor in this di&s;ea&s;e, with which all other parts &s;ympathize from defect of the excitation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; yet as this torpor occurs in &s;o &s;mall a degree as not to excite a &s;huddering or cold fit, no ob&s;ervable con&s;equences are in general occa&s;ioned by the con&s;equent accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power. Sometimes indeed in chloro&s;is there does occur a frequent pul&s;e and hot &s;kin; in which cir|cum&s;tances I &s;uppo&s;e the heart and arteries are become in &s;ome de|gree torpid by direct &s;ympathy with the torpid liver; and that hence not only the pul&s;e becomes frequent, but the capillaries of the &s;kin act more violently by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with the heart and arteries, owing to the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in them during their torpid &s;tate, as occurs in irritative fever. See Article 11 of this Supplement.</P>
<P>In apep&s;ia chronica the actions of the &s;tomach are not &s;o far impaired or de&s;troyed as totally to prevent the excitation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which therefore contributes &s;omething towards the ac|tions of the heart and arteries, though le&s;s than natural, as a weak pul&s;e always I believe attends this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>There is a torpor of the &s;tomach, and of the upper part of the ali|mentary canal in hy&s;teria, as is evident from the retrograde actions of the duodenum, &s;tomach, and oe&s;ophagus, which con&s;titute the globus hy&s;tericus, or &s;en&s;ation of a globe ri&s;ing into the throat. But as the&s;e retrograde actions are le&s;s than tho&s;e, which induce &s;ickne&s;s or vomiting,
<PB N="574" REF="5820">
and are not occa&s;ioned by previous exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, they do not &s;o totally prevent the excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, as to le&s;&s;en the motion of the heart and arteries &s;o much as to induce fever; yet in this ca&s;e, as in apep|&s;ia, and in chloro&s;is, the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries are weaker than natural, and are &s;ometimes attended with occa&s;ionally increa&s;ed action of the capillaries; as appears from the flu&s;hings of the face, and hot &s;kin, which generally form an evening febricula in di&s;ea&s;es attend|ed with weak dige&s;tion.</P>
<P N="12">12. The increa&s;ed action, or orga&s;m, of the cutaneous, pulmo|nary, and cellular capillaries, with their &s;ecerning and ab&s;orbent ve&s;|&s;els, in tho&s;e fevers which are attended with deficiency of vital action, exhau&s;ts the patient both by the additional expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power on tho&s;e organs of &s;ecretion, and by the too great ab&s;orption of the mucus and fat of the body; whence great debility and great ema|ciation. Hence one great indication of cure of continued fever with arterial debility is to dimini&s;h the too great action of the capillaries; which is to be done by frequent ablutions, or bathing the whole &s;kin in tepid or in cold water, as recommended by Dr. Currie of Liver|pool (Philo&s;. Tran&s;. for 1792), for half an hour, twice a day, or at tho&s;e times when the &s;kin feels drye&s;t and hotte&s;t. Much cool air &s;hould al&s;o be admitted, when the breath of the patient feels hot to one's hand; or when the tongue, e&s;pecially its middle part, is dry, and covered with a cru&s;t of indurated mucus; as the&s;e indicate the increa&s;ed action of the pulmonary capillaries; in the &s;ame manner as the dry and hot &s;kin indicates the orga&s;m of the cutaneous capillaries; and the emaciation of the body that of the cellular ones.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e of abating the action of the capillaries by frequent ablution or fomentation, water of any degree of heat beneath that of the body will be of &s;ervice, and ought in accurate language to be called a cold bath; but the degree of coldne&s;s, where the patient is

<P>Another great u&s;e of frequent ablutions, or fomentations, or baths, in fevers, where the &s;tomach is in &s;ome degree torpid, is to &s;upply the &s;y&s;tem with aqueous fluid by means of the cutaneous ab&s;orbents; which is di&s;&s;ipated fa&s;ter by the increa&s;ed action of the &s;ecerning ca|pillaries, than the &s;tomach can furni&s;h, and occa&s;ions great thir&s;t at the intervals of the &s;ickne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD><HI>IX.</HI> Torpor of the Lungs.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The lungs in many ca&s;es of contagion may fir&s;t be affected with torpor, and the &s;kin become cold by &s;ympathy; in the &s;ame manner as a cold &s;kin on going into the cold bath induces difficulty of breath|ing. Or the &s;tomach may become affected with torpor by its &s;ympa|thy with the lungs, as in the experiments of Mr. Watt with hydro|carbonate gas; a few re&s;pirations of which induced &s;ickne&s;s, and even &s;yncope. When the &s;tomach or &s;kin is thus affected &s;econdarily by a&s;&s;ociation, an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power occurs much &s;ooner, than when the&s;e parts become torpid in con&s;equence of previous ex|ce&s;s of &s;timulus; and hence they &s;ooner recover their accu&s;tomed ac|tion, and the fever cea&s;es. The particles of contagious matter thus received by re&s;piration &s;omewhat re&s;emble in their effects the acid ga&s;es from burning &s;ulphur, or from charcoal; which, if they do not in&s;tantly de&s;troy, induce a fever, and the patient &s;lowly recovers.</P>

detect the &s;ource of the &s;pring, and inhaled a vapour, which occa&s;ion|ed an in&s;tant &s;en&s;e of &s;uffocation. Immediately recoiling I believe I inhaled it but once; yet a few hours afterwards in the cool of the evening, when I returned home rather fatigued and hungry, a &s;hiver|ing and cold fit occurred, which was followed by a hot one; and the whole di&s;ea&s;e began and terminated in about twelve hours without re|turn. In this ca&s;e the power of fear, or of imagination, was not con|cerned; as I neither thought of the bad air of a mora&s;s before I per|ceived it; nor expected a fever-fit, till it occurred.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the torpor commenced in the lungs, and after a few hours, by the addition of fatigue, and cold, and hunger, was propa|gated by direct &s;ympathy to the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem. An orga&s;m or in|crea&s;ed action of the whole &s;y&s;tem was then induced by the accumu|lation of &s;en&s;orial power of irritation in the lungs, and of a&s;&s;ociation in the other organs; and when the&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, the di&s;ea&s;e cea&s;ed. It may be a&s;ked, could a torpor of the capillaries of the air-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs be &s;o &s;uddenly produced by great &s;timulation?&mdash;It appears pro|bable, that it might, becau&s;e great exertion of irritative motions may be in&s;tantly produced without our perceiving them; that is, without their being attended by &s;en&s;ation, both in the lungs and &s;tomach; and the organs may become torpid by the great expenditure of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation in an in&s;tant of time; as paraly&s;is frequently in|&s;tantly follows too great an exertion of voluntary power.</P>

<P>As the inactivity or torpor of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the brain is the cau&s;e of hydrocephalus internus; and as the deficiency of venous ab&s;orption in the brain, or torpor of the extremities of its veins, is believed frequently to be the cau&s;e of apoplexies; &s;o there is rea&s;on to conclude, that the torpor of the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els of the brain, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to produce the &s;en&s;orial power, may con&s;titute the im|mediate cau&s;e of &s;ome fevers with arterial debility.

<P>It is neverthele&s;s probable, that the torpor or orga&s;m of the &s;angui|ferous, ab&s;orbent, or &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els of the brain may frequently exi&s;t as a &s;econdary effect, owing to their a&s;&s;ociation with other or|gans, as the &s;tomach or lungs; and may thus be produced like the torpor of the heart and arteries in inirritative fevers, or like the orga&s;m of tho&s;e organs in irritative fevers, or inflammatory ones.</P>
<P>Where there exi&s;ts a torpor of the brain, might not very &s;light electric &s;hocks pa&s;&s;ed frequently through it in all directions be u&s;ed with advantage?

<P N="1">1. It was &s;hewn in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 6. in IV. 2. 1. 2. and in Suppl. I. 6. 3. that a rever&s;e &s;ympathy generally exi&s;ts between the lacteal and lymphatic branches of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem. Hence, when the motions of the ab&s;orbents of the &s;tomach are rendered torpid or retro|grade in fevers with arterial debility, tho&s;e of the &s;kin, lungs, and cellular membrane, act with increa&s;ed energy. But the actions of the mu&s;cular fibres of the heart and arteries are at the &s;ame time a&s;|&s;ociated with tho&s;e of the mu&s;cular fibres of the &s;tomach by direct &s;ympathy. Both the&s;e actions occur during the operation of power|ful emetics, as &s;quill, or digitalis; while the motions of the &s;tomach continue torpid or retrograde, the cellular and cutaneous ab&s;$$bents act with greater energy, and the pul&s;ations of the heart and art$ries become weaker, and &s;ometimes &s;lower.</P>
<P N="2">2. The increa&s;ed action of the &s;tomach after a meal, and of the heart and arteries at the &s;ame time from the &s;timulus of the new &s;up|ply of chyle, &s;eems originally to have produced, and to have e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, this direct &s;ympathy between them. As the increa&s;ed acti$n of the ab&s;orbents of the &s;tomach after a meal has been u&s;ually attended with dimini&s;hed action of the other branches of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem,
<PB N="579" REF="5870">
as mentioned in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 6. and has thus e&s;tabli&s;hed a rever&s;e &s;ympathy between them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be&s;ides the rever&s;e &s;ympathy of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els and the mu&s;cles of the &s;tomach, and of the heart and arteries, with tho&s;e of the &s;kin, lungs, and cellular membrane; there exi&s;ts a &s;imilar rever&s;e &s;ympathy between the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els or glands of the former of the&s;e organs with tho&s;e of the latter; that is the mucous glands of the heart and arteries act generally by direct &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach; and the mucous glands of the cellular membrane of the lungs, and of the &s;kin, act by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with them both.</P>
<P>Hence when the &s;tomach is torpid, as in &s;ickne&s;s, this torpor &s;ome|times only affects the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of it; and then the ab&s;orbents of the cellular membrane and the &s;kin only act with increa&s;ed energy by rever&s;e &s;ympathy. If the torpor affects the mu&s;cular fibres of the &s;tomach, tho&s;e of the heart and arteries act by direct &s;ympathy with it, and a weak pul&s;e is produced, as in the exhibition of digitalis, but without increa&s;e of heat. But if the torpor al&s;o affects the glands of the &s;tomach, the cutaneous and pulmonary glands act with greater energy by their rever&s;e &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, and of the heart and arteries; and great heat is produced along with increa&s;ed per&s;piration both from the &s;kin and lungs.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is &s;ome difficulty in explaining, why the actions of the exten&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of capillary glands, which exi&s;t on every other membrane and cell in the body for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecreting mucus and per&s;pirable matter, &s;hould &s;o generally act by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach and upper part of the inte&s;tines. It was &s;hewn in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 6. that when the &s;tomach was filled with &s;olid and fluid aliment, the ab&s;orbents of the cellular membrane, and of the bladder, and of the &s;kin acted with le&s;s energy; as the fluids, they were u&s;ed to ab&s;orb and tran&s;mit into the circulation, were now
<PB N="580" REF="5880">
le&s;s wanted; and that hence by habit a rever&s;e &s;ympathy obtained between the&s;e branches of the ab&s;orbents of the alimentary canal, and tho&s;e of the other parts of the body.</P>
<P>Now, as at this time le&s;s fluid was ab&s;orbed by the cutaneous and cellular lymphatics, it would happen, that le&s;s would be &s;ecreted by their corre&s;pondent &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els, or capillary glands; and that hence by habit, the&s;e &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els would acquire a rever&s;e &s;ym|pathy of action with the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els of the alimentary canal.</P>
<P>Thus when the ab&s;orption of the tears by the puncta lacrymalia is much increa&s;ed by the &s;timulus of &s;nuff; or of an affecting idea, on the na&s;al ducts, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 2. a great increa&s;e of the &s;ecretion of tears from the lacrymal glands is produced by the direct &s;ympathy of the action of the&s;e glands with tho&s;e of their cor|re&s;pondent ab&s;orbents; and that though in this ca&s;e they are placed at &s;o great a di&s;tance from each other.</P>
<P N="4">4. A difficult que&s;tion here occurs; why does it happen, that in fevers with weak pul&s;e the contractions of the heart and arteries be|come at the &s;ame time more frequent; which al&s;o &s;ometimes occurs in chloro&s;is, and in &s;ome hy&s;teric and hypochondriac di&s;ea&s;es, and in &s;ome in&s;anities; yet at other times the weak pul&s;e becomes at the &s;ame time &s;low, as in the exhibition of digitalis, and in pare&s;is irrita|tiva, de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 2. which may be termed a fever with &s;low pul&s;e? this frequency of pul&s;e can not depend on heat, becau&s;e it &s;ometimes exi&s;ts without heat, as towards the end of &s;ome fevers with debility.</P>
<P>Now as apoplexies, which are &s;ometimes a&s;cribed to fulne&s;s of blood, are attended with &s;low pul&s;e; and as in animals dying in the &s;laughter hou&s;e from deficiency of blood the pul&s;e becomes frequent in extreme; may not the frequency of pul&s;e in fevers with arterial debility be in general owing to paucity of blood? as explained in Sect. XXXII. 2. 3. and its &s;lowne&s;s in pare&s;is irritativa be cau&s;ed by
<PB N="581" REF="5890">
the debility being accompanied with due quantity of blood? or may not the former circum&s;tance &s;ometimes depend on a concomitant af|fection of the brain approaching to &s;leep? or to the unu&s;ual facility of the pa&s;&s;age of the blood through the pulmonary and aortal capil|laries? in which circum&s;tance the heart may completely empty it&s;elf at each pul$ation, though its contractions may be weak. While the latter depends on the difficulty of the pa&s;&s;age of the blood through the pulmonary or aortal capillaries, as in the cold fits of intermittents, and in &s;ome palpitations of the heart, and in &s;ome kinds of haemop|toe? in the&s;e ca&s;es the increa&s;ed re&s;i&s;tance prevents the heart from emptying it&s;elf, and in con&s;equence a new dia&s;tole &s;ooner occurs, and thus the number of pul&s;ations becomes greater in a given time.</P>
<P N="5">5. In re&s;pect to the &s;ympathies of action, which produce or con|&s;titute fever with debility, the &s;y&s;tem may be divided into certain provinces, which are a&s;&s;entient or oppo&s;ite to each other Fir&s;t, the lacteals or ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tomach, and upper part of the in|te&s;tines; &s;econdly, the lymphatics or all the other branches of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which ari&s;e from the &s;kin, mucous membranes, cel|lular membranes, and the various glands. The&s;e two divi&s;ions act by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with each other in the hot fits of fever with debility, though by direct &s;ympathy in the cold ones. The third divi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tomach and upper in|te&s;tines; and the fourth of the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els of all the other parts of the body, as the capillary glands of the &s;kin, lungs, and cellular membrane, and the various other glands belonging to the &s;angui|ferous &s;y&s;tem. Many of the&s;e frequently, but the capillaries always, act by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the third divi&s;ion above men|tioned in the hot fits of fever with debility, though by direct &s;ympa|thy with them in the cold fits. Fifthly, the mu&s;cular fibres of the &s;tomach, and upper inte&s;tines; and &s;ixthly, the mu&s;cular fibres of the heart and arteries. The actions of the&s;e two la&s;t divi&s;ions of moving
<PB N="582" REF="5900">
fibres act by direct &s;ympathy with each other, both in the cold and hot fits of fevers with debility.</P>
<P>The efficient cau&s;e of tho&s;e apparent &s;ympathies in fevers with weak pul&s;e may be thus under&s;tood. In the cold paroxy&s;m of fever with weak pul&s;e the part fir&s;t affected I believe to be the &s;tomach, and that it has become torpid by previous violent exertion, as by &s;wallowing contagious matter mixed with &s;aliva, and not by defect of &s;timulus, as from cold or hunger. The actions of this important organ, which &s;ympathizes with almo&s;t every part of the body, being thus much dimini&s;hed or nearly de&s;troyed, the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation is not excited; which in health contributes to move the heart and arteries, and all the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem; whence an univer|&s;al torpor occurs.</P>
<P>When the hot fit approaches, the &s;tomach in fevers with &s;trong pul&s;e regains its activity by the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of either irritation, if it was the part fir&s;t affected, or of a&s;&s;ociation if it was affected in &s;ympathy with &s;ome other torpid part, as the &s;pleen or liver; which accumulation is produced during its torpor. At the &s;ame time all the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem acquire greater energy of action by the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which was produced, during their inactivity in the cold fit.</P>
<P>But in fevers with weak pul&s;e the &s;tomach, who&s;e &s;en&s;orial power of irritation had been previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted by violent action, acquires no &s;uch quick accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, but remains in a &s;tate of torpor after the hot fit commences. The heart and arteries re|main al&s;o in a &s;tate of torpor, becau&s;e there continues to be no excitement of their power of a&s;&s;ociation owing to the torpid motions of the &s;tomach; but hence it happens, that there exi&s;ts at this time a great accumulation of the power of a&s;&s;ociation in the le&s;s active fibres of the heart and arteries; which, as it is not excited and ex|pended by them, increa&s;es the a&s;&s;ociability of the next link of the a&s;&s;ociated chain of motions, which con&s;i&s;ts of the capillaries or other

<P N="6">6. When the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation cau&s;ed by defect of &s;timulus is greater in the fir&s;t link of a train of actions, to which a&s;&s;ociated motions are catenated, than the deficiency of the excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in the next link, what happens?&mdash;the &s;uperabundance of the unemployed &s;en|&s;orial power of the fir&s;t link is derived to the &s;econd; the a&s;&s;ociability of which thus becomes &s;o greatly increa&s;ed, that it acts more vio|lently than natural, though the excitement of its power of a&s;&s;ociation by the le&s;&s;ened action of the fir&s;t link is le&s;s than natural. So that in this &s;ituation the withdrawing of an accu&s;tomed &s;timulus in &s;ome parts of the &s;y&s;tem will decrea&s;e the irritative motions of that part, and at the &s;ame time occa&s;ion an increa&s;e of the a&s;&s;ociate motion of another part, which is catenated with it.</P>

By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this new fact the curious circum&s;tance of the quick production of warmth of the &s;kin on co|vering the head under the bed-clothes, which every one mu&s;t at &s;ome time have experienced, receives a more &s;atisfactory explanation, than that which is given in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 2. which was printed before this part of Dr. Beddoes's Con&s;iderations was publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>For if the blood be deprived of its accu&s;tomed quantity of oxygen, as in covering the head in bed, and thus breathing an air rendered im|pure by repeated re&s;piration, or by breathing a factitious air with le&s;s proportion of oxygen, which in common re&s;piration pa&s;&s;es through the moi&s;t membranes of the lungs, and mixes with the blood, the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries become weaker, and con&s;e|quently quicker, by the defect of the &s;timulus of oxygen. And as the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are &s;ubject to perpetual motion, the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation becomes &s;o great by their le&s;&s;ened ac|tivity, that it excites the ve&s;&s;els next connected, the cutaneous capil|laries for in&s;tance, into more energetic actions, &s;o as to produce in|crea&s;ed heat of the &s;kin, and greater per&s;piration.</P>
<P>How exactly this re&s;embles a continued fever with weak and quick pul&s;e!&mdash;in the latter the action of the heart and arteries are le&s;&s;ened by defect of the excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, owing to the torpor or le&s;&s;ened actions of the &s;tomach; hence the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in this ca&s;e, as the accumulation of that of irritation in the former, becomes &s;o abundant as to excite into increa&s;ed action the parts mo&s;t nearly connected, as the cutaneous capillaries.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the circum&s;tance mentioned by Sydenham, that co|vering the head in bed in a &s;hort time relieved the pertinacious &s;ick|ne&s;s of the patient, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that when the action of the heart and arteries become weakened by the want of the due &s;timulus

of the proper quantity of oxygen in the blood, that an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation occurs in the fibres of the heart and arteries, which then is expended on tho&s;e of the capillary glands, increa&s;ing their actions and con&s;equent &s;ecretions and heat. And then the &s;tomach is thrown into &s;tronger action, both by the greater excitement of its natural quantity of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation by the increa&s;ed actions of the capillaries, and al&s;o by &s;ome increa&s;e of a&s;&s;ociability, as it had been previou&s;ly a long time in a &s;tate of tor|por, or le&s;s activity than natural, as evinced by its perpetual &s;ick|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In a manner &s;omewhat &s;imilar to this, is the redne&s;s of the &s;kin produced in angry people by the &s;uperabundance of the unemployed &s;en&s;orial power of volition, as explained in Cla&s;s IV. 2. 3. 5. Rubor ex ir&acirc;. From hence we learn how, when people in fevers with weak pul&s;e, or in drop&s;ies, become in&s;ane, the abundance of the unemployed &s;en&s;orial power of volition increa&s;es the actions of the whole moving &s;y&s;tem, and cures tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="7">7. As the orga&s;m of the capillaries in fevers with weak pul&s;e is immediately cau&s;ed by the torpid actions of the heart and arteries, as above explained, this &s;upplies us with another indication of cure in &s;uch fevers, and that is to &s;timulate the&s;e organs. This may pro|bably be done by &s;ome kind of medicines, which are known to pa&s;s into the blood unchanged in &s;ome of their properties. It is po&s;&s;ible that nitre, or its acid, may pa&s;s into the blood and increa&s;e the co|lour of it, and thus increa&s;e its &s;timulus, and the &s;ame may be &s;uppo&s;ed of other &s;alts, neutral or metallic? As rubia tinctoria, madder, colours the bones of young animals, it mu&s;t pa&s;s int$ the blood with its colouring matter at lea&s;t unchanged, and perhaps many other medicines may likewi&s;e affect the blood, and thus act by &s;timulating the heart and arteries, as well as by &s;timulating the &s;to|mach; which circum&s;tance de&s;erves further attention.</P>
<P><PB N="586" REF="5940">
Another way of immediately &s;timulating the heart and arteries would be by transfu&s;ing new blood into them. Is it po&s;&s;ible that any other fluid be&s;ides blood, as chyle, or milk, or water, could, if ma|naged with great art, be introduced &s;afely or advantageou&s;ly into the vein of a living animal?</P>
<P>A third method of exciting the heart and arteries immediately is by increa&s;ing the natural &s;timulus of the blood, and is well worthy experiment in all fevers with weak pul&s;e; and that con&s;i&s;ts in &s;up|plying the blood with a greater proportion of oxygen; which may be done by re&s;piration, if the patient was to breathe either oxygen gas pure, or diluted with atmo&s;pheric air, which might be given to many gallons frequently in a day, and by pa&s;&s;ing through the moi&s;t membranes of the lungs, according to the experiments of Dr. Prie&s;t|ley, and uniting with the blood, might render it more &s;timulant, and thus excite the heart and arteries into greater action! May not &s;ome ea&s;ier method of exhibiting oxygen gas by re&s;piration be di&s;covered, as by u&s;ing very &s;mall quantities of hyper-oxygenated marine acid gas very much diluted with atmo&s;pheric air?</P>

<HEAD><HI>XII.</HI> Torpor of the Stomach and upper Inte&s;tines.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The principal circum&s;tance, which &s;upports the increa&s;ed ac|tion of the capillaries in continued fever with weak pul&s;e, is their rever&s;e &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach and upper inte&s;tines, or with tho&s;e of the heart and arteries. The torpor of the &s;tomach and upper inte&s;tines is apparent in continued fevers from the total want of appetite for &s;olid food, be&s;ides the &s;ickne&s;s with which fevers gene|rally commence, and the frequent diarrhoea with indige&s;ted &s;tools, at the &s;ame time the thir&s;t of the patient is &s;ometimes urgent at the intervals of the &s;ickne&s;s. Why the &s;tomach can at this time take fluids by intervals, and not &s;olids, is difficult to explain; except it be &s;uppo&s;ed, as &s;ome have affirmed, that the lacteal ab&s;orbents are a different
<PB N="587" REF="5950">
branch from the lymphatic ab&s;orbents, and that in this ca&s;e the former only are in a &s;tate of permanent torpor.</P>
<P N="2">2. The torpor of the heart and arteries is known by the weak|ne&s;s of the pul&s;e. When the actions of the ab&s;orbents of the &s;to|mach are dimini&s;hed by the exhibition of &s;mall do&s;es of digitalis, or become retrograde by larger ones, the heart and arteries act more feebly by direct &s;ympathy; but the cellular, cutaneous, and pulmonary ab&s;orbents are excited into greater action. Whence in ana&s;arca the fluids in the cellular membrane throughout the whole body are ab|&s;orbed during the &s;ickne&s;s, and frequently a great quantity of atmo&s;|pheric moi&s;ture at the &s;ame time; as appears by the very great di&s;|charge of urine, which &s;ometimes happens in the&s;e ca&s;es; and in ileus the prodigious evacuations by vomiting, which are often a hun|dred fold greater than the quantity &s;wallowed, evince the great action of all the other ab&s;orbents during the &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P N="3">3. But when the &s;tomach is rendered permanently &s;ick by an emetic drug, as by digitalis, it is not probable, that much accumu|lation of &s;en&s;orial power is &s;oon produced in this organ; becau&s;e its u&s;ual quantity of &s;en&s;orial power is previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted by the great &s;timulus of the foxglove; and hence it &s;eems probable, that the great accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, which now cau&s;es the increa&s;ed action of the ab&s;orbents, is produced in con&s;equence of the inactivity of the heart and arteries; which inactivity is induced by deficient excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation between tho&s;e organs and the &s;tomach, and not by any previous exhau&s;tion of their natural quantity of &s;en&s;orial power; whereas in ileus, where the torpor of the &s;tomach, and con&s;equent &s;ickne&s;s, is induced by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with an inflamed inte&s;tine, that is, by di&s;&s;evered or defective a&s;&s;ocia|tion; the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, which in that di&s;ea&s;e &s;o violently actuates the cellular, pulmonary, and cutaneous ab&s;orbents, is
<PB N="588" REF="5960">
apparently produced by the torpor of the &s;tomach and lacteals, and the con&s;equent accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in them owing to their le&s;&s;ened action in &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. This accounts for the dry &s;kin in fevers with weak pul&s;e, where the &s;tomach and the heart and arteries are in a torpid &s;tate, and for the &s;udden emaciation of the body; becau&s;e the actions of the cellular and cutaneous ab&s;orbents are increa&s;ed by rever&s;e &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach, or with tho&s;e of the heart and arteries; that is by the expenditure of that &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which is accumulated in con&s;equence of the torpor of the &s;tomach and heart and arteries, or of either of them; this al&s;o explains the &s;udden ab|&s;orption of the milk in puerperal fevers; and contributes along with the heat of the re&s;pired air to the dryne&s;s of the mucous membrane of the tongue and no&s;trils.</P>
<P N="5">5. Be&s;ides the rever&s;e &s;ympathy, with which the ab&s;orbent ve&s;|&s;els of the &s;tomach and upper inte&s;tines act in re&s;pect to all the other ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, as in the exhibition of digitalis, and in ileus; there is another rever&s;e &s;ympathy exi&s;ts between the capillaries, or &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tomach, and tho&s;e of the &s;kin. Which may neverthele&s;s be occa&s;ioned by the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power by the torpor of the heart and arteries, which is induced by direct &s;ym|pathy with the &s;tomach; thus when the torpor of the &s;tomach re|mains in a fever-fit, which might otherwi&s;e have intermitted, the tor|por of the heart and arteries remains al&s;o by direct &s;ympathy, and the increa&s;ed cutaneous capillary action, and con&s;equent heat, are pro|duced by rever&s;e &s;ympathy; and the fever is thus rendered continual, owing primarily to the torpor of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P N="6">6. The rever&s;e &s;ympathy, which exi&s;ts between the capillaries of the &s;tomach and the cutaneous capillaries, appears by the chillne&s;s of
<PB N="589" REF="5970">
&s;ome people after dinner; and contrary-wi&s;e by the dige&s;tion being &s;trengthened, when the &s;kin is expo&s;ed to cold air for a &s;hort time; as mentioned in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 4. and IV. 2. 1. 1. and from the heat and glow on the &s;kin, which attends the action of vomiting; for though when &s;ickne&s;s fir&s;t commences, the &s;kin is pale and cold; as it then partakes of the general torpor, which induces the &s;ickne&s;s; yet after the vomiting has continued &s;ome minutes, &s;o that an accu|mulation of &s;en&s;orial power exi&s;ts in the capillaries of the &s;tomach, and of the &s;kin, owing to their dimini&s;hed action; a glow of the &s;kin &s;ucceeds, with &s;weat, as well as with increa&s;ed ab&s;orption.</P>
<P N="7">7. Neverthele&s;s in &s;ome circum&s;tances the &s;tomach and the heart and arteries &s;eem to act by direct &s;ympathy with the cutaneous capil|laries, as in the flu&s;hing of the face and glow of the &s;kin of &s;ome people after dinner; and as in fevers with &s;trong pul&s;e. In the&s;e ca&s;es there appears to be an increa&s;ed production of &s;en&s;orial power, either of &s;en&s;ation, as in the blu&s;h of &s;hame; or of volition, as in the blu&s;h of anger; or of irritation, as in the flu&s;hed face after dinner above mentioned.</P>
<P>This increa&s;ed action of the capillaries of the &s;kin along with the increa&s;ed actions of the &s;tomach and heart is perhaps to be e&s;teemed a &s;ynchronous increa&s;e of action, rather than a &s;ympathy between tho&s;e organs. Thus the flu&s;hing of the face after dinner may be owing to the &s;ecretion of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain being increa&s;ed by the a&s;&s;ociation of that organ with the &s;tomach, in a greater proportion than the increa&s;ed expenditure of it, or may be owing al&s;o to the &s;ti|mulus of new chyle received into the blood.</P>
<P N="8">8. When the &s;tomach and the heart and arteries are rendered torpid in fevers, not only the cutaneous, cellular, and pulmonary ab|&s;orbents are excited to act with greater energy; but al&s;o their corre&s;|pondent capillaries and &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els or glands, e&s;pecially perhaps
<PB N="590" REF="5980">
tho&s;e of the &s;kin, are induced into more energetic action. Whence greater heat, a greater &s;ecretion of per&s;pirable matter, and of mucus; and a greater ab&s;orption of them both, and of aerial moi&s;ture. The&s;e rever&s;e &s;ympathies coincide with other animal facts, as in eruption of &s;mall pox on the face and neck the feet become cold, while the face and neck are much flu&s;hed; and in the hemiplagia, when one arm and leg become di&s;obedient to volition, the patient is perpetually moving the other. Which are well accounted for by the accumula|tion of &s;en&s;orial power in one part of an a&s;&s;ociated &s;eries of actions, when le&s;s of it is expended by another part of it; and by a deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power in the &s;econd link of a&s;&s;ociation, when too much of it is expended by the fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="9">9. This doctrine of rever&s;e &s;ympathy enables us to account for that difficult problem, why in continued fevers the increa&s;ed action o$ the cutaneous, cellular, and pulmonary capillaries proceeds without in|terruption or return of cold fit; though perhaps with &s;ome exacerba|tions and remi&s;&s;ions; and that during a quarter, or half, or three quarters, or a whole lunation; while at the &s;ame time the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries are weaker than natural.</P>
<P>To this &s;hould be added the direct &s;ympathy, which exi&s;ts be|tween the peri&s;taltic motions of the fibres of the &s;tomach, and the pul&s;ations of the heart. And that the &s;tomach has become torpid by the too great &s;timulus of &s;ome poi&s;onous or contagious matter; and this very intricate idea of continued fever with feeble pul&s;e is reduced to curious &s;implicity.</P>
<P>The direct &s;ympathy of the &s;tomach and heart and arteries not only appears from the &s;tronger and &s;lower pul&s;e of per&s;ons exhau&s;ted by fatigue, after they have drank a gla&s;s of wine, and eaten a few mouthfuls; but appears al&s;o from the exhibition of large do&s;es of digitalis; when the patient labours under great and ince&s;&s;ant efforts to vomit, at the &s;ame time that the actions of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="591" REF="5990">
are known to be much increa&s;ed by the ha&s;ty ab&s;orption of the &s;erous fluid in ana&s;arca, the pul&s;ations of the heart become &s;low and inter|mittent to an alarming degree. See Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 17. and 18.</P>
<P N="10">10. It would a&s;&s;i&s;t us much in the knowledge and cure of fevers, if we could always determine, which part of the &s;y&s;tem was pri|marily affected; and whether the torpor of it was from previous ex|ce&s;s or defect of &s;timulus; which the indu&s;try of future ob&s;ervers mu&s;t di&s;cover. Thus if the &s;tomach be affected primarily, and that by previous exce&s;s of &s;timulus, as when certain quantities of opium, or wine, or blue vitriol, or ar&s;enic, are &s;wallowed, it is &s;ome time in recovering the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted by exce&s;s of &s;timulus, before any accumulation of it can occur. But if it be affected with torpor &s;econdarily, by &s;ympathy with &s;ome di&s;tant part; as with the torpid capillaries of the &s;kin, that is by defective excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; or if it be affected by defect of &s;timulus of food or of heat; it &s;ooner acquires &s;o much accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, as to be enabled to accommodate it|&s;elf to its le&s;&s;ened &s;timulus by increa&s;e of its irritability.</P>
<P>Thus in the hemicrania the torpor generally commences in a di&s;|ea&s;ed tooth, and the membranes about the temple, and al&s;o tho&s;e of the &s;tomach become torpid by direct &s;ynchronous &s;ympathy; and pain of the head, and &s;ickne&s;s &s;upervene; but no fever or quickne&s;s of pul&s;e. In this ca&s;e the torpor of the &s;tomach is owing to defect of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which is cau&s;ed by the too feeble actions of the membranes &s;urrounding the di&s;ea&s;ed tooth, and thus the train of &s;ympathy cea&s;es here without affecting the motions of the heart and arteries; but where contagious matter is &s;wallow$$ into the &s;tomach, the &s;tomach after a time becomes torpid from exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, and the heart and arteries act feebly from defect of the excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation. In the former ca&s;e the torpor of the &s;tomach is conquered by accumulation of the
<PB N="592" REF="6000">
power of a&s;&s;ociation in one or two whole days; in the latter it recovers by accumulation of the power of irritation in three or four weeks.</P>
<P>In intermittent fevers the &s;tomach is generally I bel$eve affected &s;e|condarily by &s;ympathy with the torpid cutaneous capillaries, or with &s;ome internal torpid vi&s;cus, and on this account an accumulation of &s;en|&s;orial power ari&s;es in a few hours &s;ufficient to re&s;tore the natural irrita|bility of this organ; and hence the hot fit &s;ucceeds, and the fever inter|mits. Or if this accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power becomes exce&s;&s;ive and permanent, the continued fever with &s;trong pul&s;e is produced, or febris irritativa.</P>
<P>In continued fevers the &s;tomach is frequently I &s;uppo&s;e affected with torpor by previous exce&s;s of &s;timulus, and con&s;equent exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power, as when contagious matter is &s;wallowed with the &s;aliva, and it is then much &s;lower in producing an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power &s;ufficient to re&s;tore its healthy irritability; which is a frequent cau&s;e of continued fever with weak pul&s;e or febris inirrita|tiva. Which con&s;i&s;ts, after the cold fit is over, in a more frequent and more feeble action of the heart and arteries, owing to their di|rect &s;ympathy with the mu&s;cular fibres of the torpid &s;tomach; toge|ther with an increa&s;ed action of the capillaries, glands, and ab&s;orbents of the &s;kin, and cellular membrane, owing to their rever&s;e &s;ympathy with the torpid capillaries, glands, and ab&s;orbents of the &s;tomach, or with tho&s;e of the heart and arteries.</P>
<P>Or in more accurate language. 1. The febris inirritativa, or fever with weak pul&s;e, commences with torpor of the &s;tomach, occa&s;ioned by previous exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power of irritation by the &s;timulus of contagious matter &s;wallowed with the &s;aliva. 2. The whole &s;y&s;tem becomes torpid from defect of the excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation owing to the too feeble actions of the &s;tomach, this is the cold fit. 3. The whole &s;y&s;tem, except the &s;tomach with the upper inte&s;tines, and the heart and arteries, falls into increa&s;ed action, or orga&s;m, owing to accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation
<PB N="593" REF="6010">
during their previous torpor, this is the hot fit. 4. The &s;to|mach and upper inte&s;tines have not acquired their natural quantity of &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, which was previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted by vio|lent action in con&s;equence of the &s;timulus of contagious matter, and the heart and arteries remain torpid from deficient excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation owing to the too feeble actions of the &s;tomach. 5. The accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in con&s;equence of the torpor of the heart and arteries occa&s;ions a perpe|tual orga&s;m, or increa&s;ed action of the capillaries.</P>
<P N="11">11. From hence it may be deducted fir&s;t, that when the torpor of the &s;tomach fir&s;t occurs, either as a primary effect, or as a &s;econdary link of &s;ome a&s;&s;ociate train or circle of motions, a general torpor of the &s;y&s;tem &s;ometimes accompanies it, which con&s;titutes the cold fit of fever; at other times no &s;uch general torpor occurs, as during the operation of a weak emetic, or during &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly. After a time it generally happens, that a torpor of the &s;tomach cea&s;es, and its actions are renewed with increa&s;e of vigour by accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power during its quie&s;cence; as after the operation of a weak emetic, or at the intervals of &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, or after the paroxy&s;m of an intermittent fever.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The &s;tomach is &s;ometimes much &s;lower in recovering from a previous torpor, and is then the remote cau&s;e of continued fever with weak pul&s;e; which is owing to a torpor of the heart and arteries, produced in con&s;equence of the deficient excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation by the too weak actions of the &s;tomach; and to an orga&s;m of the capillaries of the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, in con|&s;equence of the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power occa&s;ioned by the inactivity of the heart and arteries.</P>
<P>Fourthly. The torpor of the &s;tomach is &s;ometimes &s;o complete, that probably the origin of its nerves is likewi&s;e affected, and then no accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power occurs. In this ca&s;e the patient dies

for want of nouri&s;hment; either in three or four weeks, of the inirri|tative fever; or without quick pul&s;e, by what we have called pare&s;is irritativa. Or he continues many years in a &s;tate of total debility. When this torpor &s;uddenly commences, the patient generally &s;uffers epileptic fits or temporary in&s;anity from the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation of &s;o great a torpor of the &s;tomach; which al&s;o happens &s;ometimes at the eruption of the di&s;tinct &s;mall pox; whence we have termed this di&s;ea&s;e anorexia epileptica. See Cla&s;s II. 2. 2. 1. and III. 1. 1. 7. and Suppl. I. 14. 3.</P>
<P>Fifthly. When this torpor of the &s;tomach is le&s;s in degree or ex|tent, and yet without recovering its natural irritability by accumula|tion of &s;en&s;orial power, as it does after the cold fit of intermittent fever, or after the operation of mild emetics, or during &s;yncope; a permanent defect of its activity, and of that of the upper inte&s;tines, remains, which con&s;titutes apep&s;ia, cardialgia, hypochondria&s;is, and hy&s;teria. See Cla&s;s I. 3. 1. 3. and I. 2. 4. 5.</P>
<P>Sixthly. If the torpor of the &s;tomach be induced by direct &s;ym|pathy, as in con&s;equence of a previous torpor of the liver, or &s;pleen, or &s;kin, an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power will &s;ooner be produced in the &s;tomach; becau&s;e there has been no previous expenditure of it, the pre&s;ent torpor of the &s;tomach ari&s;ing from defect of a&s;&s;ociation. Hence &s;ome fevers perfectly intermit, the &s;tomach recovering its complete action after the torpor and con&s;equent orga&s;m, which con|&s;titute the paroxy&s;m of fever, are terminated.</P>
<P>Seventhly. If the torpor of the &s;tomach be owing to defect of ir|ritation, as to the want of food, an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power &s;oon occurs with an increa&s;e of dige&s;tion, if food be timely applied; or with violent inflammation, if food be given in too great quantity after very long ab&s;tinence.</P>
<P>Eighthly. If the torpor of the &s;tomach be induced by defect of plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation, as when &s;ickne&s;s is cau&s;ed by the &s;ugge&s;tion of nau&s;eous ideas; an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power &s;oon occurs, and
<PB N="595" REF="6030">
the &s;ickne&s;s cea&s;es with the return of hunger; for in this ca&s;e the inactivity of the &s;tomach is occa&s;ioned by the &s;ubduction of agreeable &s;en&s;ation, which acts as a &s;ubduction of &s;timulus, and not by exhau&s;t|ing the natural quantity of &s;en&s;orial power in the fibres or nerves of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>Ninthly. If the torpor of the &s;tomach be induced by a two|fold cau&s;e, as in &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s. See Vertigo rotatoria. Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 10. in which the fir&s;t link of a&s;&s;ociation acts too &s;trongly, and in con&s;e|quence expends more than u&s;ual of the &s;en&s;orial power of iritation; and &s;econdly in which &s;en&s;ation is produced between the links of a&s;&s;ociation, and di&s;&s;evers or enfeebles them; the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power &s;oon occurs in the &s;tomach; as no previous expendi|ture of it in that organ has occurred. Whence in &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s the per&s;ons take food with eagerne&s;s at times, when the vertigo ca&s;es for a few minutes.</P>
<P>Tenthly. If the ga&s;tric torpor be induced by previous violent exertion, as after intoxication, or after contagious matter has been &s;wallowed, or &s;ome poi&s;ons, as digitalis, or ar&s;enic; an accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power very &s;lowly &s;ucceeds; whence long &s;ickne&s;s, or continued fever, becau&s;e the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power already wa&s;ted mu&s;t fir&s;t be renewed, before an accumulation of it can be produced.</P>
<P N="12">12. This leads us to a &s;econd indication of cure in continued fevers, which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;trengthening the actions of the &s;tomach; as the fir&s;t indication con&s;i&s;ted in decrea&s;ing the actions of the cutane|ous capillaries and ab&s;orbents. The actions of the &s;tomach may &s;ometimes be increa&s;ed by exhibiting a mild emetic; as an accumula|tion of &s;en&s;orial power in the fibres of the &s;tomach is produced during their retrograde actions. Be&s;ides the evacuation of any noxious ma|terial from the &s;tomach and duodenum, and from the ab&s;orbents,
<PB N="596" REF="6040">
which open their mouths on their internal &s;urfaces, by their retrograde motion.</P>
<P>It is probable, that when mild emetics are given, as ipecacuanha, or antimonium tartarizatum, or infu&s;ion of chamomile, they are re|jected by an inverted motion of the &s;tomach and oe&s;ophagus in con|&s;equence of di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, as du&s;t is excluded from the eye; and the&s;e actions having by previous habit been found effectual, and that hence there is no exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation. But where &s;trong emetics are admini&s;tered, as digitalis, or contagious matter, the previous exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation &s;eems to be a cau&s;e of the continued retrograde actions and &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach. An emetic of the former kind may therefore &s;trengthen the power of the &s;tomach immediately after its operation by the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power of irritation during its action. See Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1.</P>
<P>Another method of decrea&s;ing the action of the &s;tomach for a time, and thence of increa&s;ing it afterwards, is by the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation during its torpor; is by giving ice, iced water, iced creams, or iced wine. This accounts for the plea&s;ure, which many people in fevers with weak pul&s;e expre&s;s on drinking cold beverage of any kind.</P>
<P>A &s;econd method of exciting the &s;tomach into action, and of de|crea&s;ing that of the capillaries in con&s;equence, is by the &s;timulus of wine, opium, bark, metallic &s;alts of antimony, &s;teel, copper, ar&s;enic, given in &s;mall repeated quantities; which &s;o long as they render the pul&s;e &s;lower are certainly of &s;ervice, and may be given warm or cold, as mo&s;t agreeable to the patient. For it is po&s;&s;ible, that the capil|laries of the &s;tomach may act too violently, and produce heat, at the &s;ame time that the large mu&s;cles of it may be in a torpid &s;tate; which curious circum&s;tance future ob&s;ervations mu&s;t determine.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Hot fomentation on the region of the &s;tomach might be of mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice by its &s;timulus, as heat penetrates the
<PB N="597" REF="6050">
&s;y&s;tem not by the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, but by external influence; whence the u&s;e of hot fomentation to the head in torpor of the brain; and the u&s;e of hot bath in ca&s;es of general debility, which has been much too frequently neglected from a popular error occa|&s;ioned by the unmeaning application of the word relaxation to animal power. If the fluid of heat could be directed to pa&s;s through parti|cular parts of the body with as little diffu&s;ion of its influence, as that of electricity in the &s;hocks from the coated jar, it might be employed with &s;till greater advantage.</P>
<P>Fourthly. The u&s;e of repeated &s;mall electric &s;hocks through the region of the &s;tomach might be of &s;ervice in fevers with weak pul&s;e, and well de&s;erves a trial; twenty or thirty &s;mall &s;hocks twice a day for a week or two would be a promi&s;ing experiment.</P>
<P>Fifthly. A bli&s;ter on the back, or &s;ides, or on the pit of the &s;to|mach, repeated in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by &s;timulating the &s;kin frequently &s;trengthens the action of the &s;tomach by exciting the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; this e&s;pecially in tho&s;e fevers where the &s;kin of the ex|tremities, as of the hands or no&s;e or ears, &s;ooner becomes cold, when expo&s;ed to the air, than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Sixthly. The action of the &s;tomach may be increa&s;ed by prevent|ing too great expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power in the link of previous motion with which it is catenated, e&s;pecially if the action of that link be greater than natural. Thus as the capillaries of the &s;kin act too violently in fevers with weak pul&s;e, if the&s;e are expo&s;ed to cold air or cold water, the &s;en&s;orial power, which previou&s;ly occa&s;ioned their orga&s;m, becomes accumulated, and tends to increa&s;e the action of the &s;tomach; thus in tho&s;e fevers with weak pul&s;e and hot &s;kin, if the &s;tomach be &s;timulated by repeated &s;mall do&s;es of bark and wine or opium, and be further excited at the &s;ame time by accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power occa&s;ioned by rendering the capillaries torpid by cold air or water, this twofold application is frequently attended with vi&s;ible good effect.</P>
<P><PB N="598" REF="6060">
By thus &s;timulating the torpid &s;tomach into greater action, the motions of the heart and arteries will likewi&s;e be increa&s;ed by the greater excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation. And the capillaries of the &s;kin will cea&s;e to act &s;o violently, from their not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o great a &s;uperfluity of &s;en&s;orial power as during the greater quie&s;cence of the &s;tomach and of the heart and arteries. Which is in &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances &s;imilar to the curious phenomenon mentioned in Cla&s;s IV. 2. 2. 10; where, by covering the chill feet with flannel at the eruption of the &s;mall-pox, the points of the flannel &s;timulate the &s;kin of the feet into greater action, and the quantity of heat, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, is al&s;o confined, or in&s;ulated, and further increa&s;es by its &s;ti|mulus the activity of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els of the feet; and by that circum&s;tance abates the too great action of the capillaries of the face, and the con&s;equent heat of it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>XIII.</HI> Ca&s;e of continued fever.</HEAD>
<P>The following ca&s;e of continued fever which I frequently &s;aw during its progre&s;s, as it is le&s;s complicate than u&s;ual, may illu&s;trate this doctrine. Ma&s;ter S. D. an active boy about eight years of age, had been much in the &s;now for many days, and &s;at in the cla&s;&s;ical &s;chool with wet feet; he had al&s;o about a fortnight attended a writing &s;chool, where many children of the lower order were in&s;tructed. He was &s;eized on February the 8th, 1795, with great languor, and pain in his forehead, with vomiting and perpetual &s;ickne&s;s; his pul&s;e weak, but not very frequent. He took an emetic, and on the next day, had a bli&s;ter, which checked the &s;ickne&s;s only for a few hours; his &s;kin became perpetually hot, and dry; and his tongue white and furred; his pul&s;e when a&s;leep about 104 in a minute, and when awake about 112.</P>
<P>Fourth day of the di&s;ea&s;e. He has had another bli&s;ter, the pain
<PB N="599" REF="6070">
of his head is gone, but the &s;ickne&s;s continues by intervals; he re|fu&s;es to take any &s;olid food, and will drink nothing but milk, or milk and water, cold. He has two or three very liquid &s;tools every day, which are &s;omtimes green, but generally of a darki&s;h yellow, with great flatulency both upwards and downwards at tho&s;e times. An antimonial powder was once given, but in&s;tantly rejected; a &s;poonful of decoction of bark was al&s;o exhibited with the &s;ame event. His legs are bathed, and his hands and face are moi&s;tened twice a day for half an hour in warmi&s;h water, which is neverthele&s;s much colder than his &s;kin.</P>
<P>Eighth day. His &s;kin continues hot and dry without any ob&s;erv|able remi&s;&s;ions, with liquid &s;tools and much flatulency and &s;ickne&s;s; his water when ob&s;erved was of a &s;traw colour. He has a&s;ked for cyder, and drinks nearly a bottle a day mixed with cold water, and takes three drops of laudanum twice a day.</P>
<P>Twelfth day. He continues much the &s;ame, takes no milk, drinks only cyder and water, &s;kin hot and dry, tongue hot and furred, with liquid &s;tools, and &s;ickne&s;s always at the &s;ame time; &s;leeps much.</P>
<P>Sixteenth day. Was apparently more torpid, and once rather de|lious; pul&s;e 112. Takes only capillaire and water; &s;leeps much.</P>
<P>Twentieth day. Pul&s;e 100, &s;kin dry but le&s;s hot, liquid &s;tools not &s;o frequent, he is emaciated to a great degree, he has eaten half a tea-cup full of cu&s;tard to day, drinks only capillaire and water, has thrice taken two large &s;poonfuls of decoction of bark with three drops of laudanum, refu&s;es to have his legs bathed, and will now take no|thing but three drops of laudanum twice a day.</P>
<P>Twenty-fourth day. He has gradually taken more cu&s;tard every day, and began to attend to &s;ome new play things, and takes wine &s;yllabub.</P>
<P>Twenty-eighth day. He daily grows &s;tronger, eats eggs, and
<PB N="600" REF="6080">
and butter, and &s;leeps immediately after his food, can creep on his hands and knees, but cannot &s;tand erect.</P>
<P>Thirty-&s;econd day. He cannot yet &s;tand alone &s;afely, but &s;eems hourly to improve in &s;trength of body, and activity of mind.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the remote cau&s;e of his fever could not be well a&s;cer|tained, as it might be from having his feet cold for many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, or from contagion; but the latter &s;eems more probable, becau&s;e his younger brother became ill of a &s;imilar fever about three weeks afterwards, and probably received the infection from him. The di&s;|ea&s;e commenced with great torpor of the &s;tomach, which was &s;hewn by his total aver&s;ion to &s;olid food, and perpetual &s;ickne&s;s; the watery &s;tools, which were &s;ometimes green, or of a darki&s;h yellow, were owing to the acrimony, or acidity, of the contents of the bowels; which as well as the flatulency were occa&s;ioned by indige&s;tion. This torpor of the &s;tomach continued throughout the whole fever, and when it cea&s;ed, the fever cea&s;ed along with it.</P>
<P>The contagious material of this fever I &s;uppo&s;e to have been mixed with the &s;aliva, and &s;wallowed into the &s;tomach; that it excited the ve&s;&s;els, which con&s;titute the &s;tomach, into the greate&s;t irritative mo|tion like ar&s;enic; <HI>which might not be perceived, and yet might render that organ paralytic or inirritable in a moment of time;</HI> as animals &s;ometimes die by one &s;ingle exertion, and con&s;equent paraly&s;is, with|out a &s;econd &s;truggle; as by lightning, or being &s;hot through the back part of the brain; of both which I have &s;een in&s;tances. I had once an opportunity of in&s;pecting two oxen, a few minutes after they were killed by lightning under a crab-tree on moi&s;t ground in long gra&s;s; and ob&s;erved, that they could not have &s;truggled, as the gra&s;s was not pre&s;&s;ed or bent near them; I have al&s;o &s;een two hor&s;es &s;hot through the cerebellum, who never once drew in their legs after they fir&s;t &s;tretched them out, but died in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; in a &s;imilar manner the lungs &s;eem to be rendered in&s;tantly inanimate by the fumes of burning &s;ulphur.</P>
<P><PB N="601" REF="6090">
The lungs may be &s;ometimes primarily affected with contagious matter floating in the atmo&s;phere as well as the &s;tomach, as men|tioned in article 9. of this Supplement. But probably this may oc|cur much le&s;s frequently, becau&s;e the oxygene of the atmo&s;phere does not appear to be taken into the blood by animal ab&s;orption, as the &s;aliva in the &s;tomach, but pa&s;&s;es through the moi&s;t membranes into the blood, like the ethereal fluids of electricity or heat, or by chemical attraction, and in con&s;equence the contagious matter may be left behind; except it may &s;ometimes be ab&s;orbed along with the mucus; of which however in this ca&s;e there appeared no &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>The ton&s;ils are other organs liable to receive contagious matter, as in the &s;mall-pox, &s;carlet-fever, and in other &s;en&s;itive inirritated fevers; but no &s;ymptom of this appeared here, as the ton&s;ils were at no time of the fever inflamed, though they were in this child previ|ou&s;ly uncommonly large.</P>
<P>The pain of the forehead does not &s;eem to have been of the inter|nal parts of the head, becau&s;e the nerves, which &s;erve the &s;tomach, are not derived from the anterior part of the brain; but it &s;eems to have been owing to a torpor of the external membranes about the forehead from their direct &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of the &s;tomach; that is, from the deficient excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; and &s;eemed in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be relieved by the emetics and bli&s;ters.</P>
<P>The pul&s;ations of the heart were weaker and in con&s;equence quicker than natural, owing to their direct &s;ympathy with the torpid peri&s;|taltic motions of the &s;tomach; that is to the deficient excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>The action of the cutaneous capillaries and ab&s;orbents were &s;tronger than natural, as appeared by the perpetual heat and dryne&s;s of the &s;kin; which was owing to their rever&s;e &s;ympathy with the heart and arteries. This weaker and quicker action of the heart
<PB N="602" REF="6100">
and arteries, and the &s;tronger action of the cutaneous capillaries and ab&s;orbents, continued throughout the di&s;ea&s;e, and may be &s;aid to have con&s;tituted the fever, of which the torpor of the &s;tomach was the remote cau&s;e.</P>
<P>His tongue was not very much furred or very dry, nor his breath very hot; which &s;hewed, that there was no great increa&s;e of the action of the mucous ab&s;orbents, nor of the pulmonary capillaries, and yet &s;ufficient to produce great emaciation. His urine was nearly natural both in quantity and colour; which &s;hewed, that there was no increa&s;e of action either of the kidnies, or of the urinary ab|&s;orbents.</P>
<P>The bathing his legs and hands and face for half an hour twice a day &s;eemed to refre&s;h him, and &s;ometimes made his pul&s;e &s;lower, and thence I &s;uppo&s;e &s;tronger. This &s;eems to have been cau&s;ed by the water, though &s;ubtepid, being much below the heat of his &s;kin, and con&s;equently contributing to cool the capillaries, and by &s;atiating the ab&s;orbents to relieve the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation from the dryne&s;s of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>He continued the u&s;e of three drops of tincture of opium from about the eighth day to the twenty-fourth, and for the three preced|ing days took along with it two large &s;poonfuls of an infu&s;ion or bark in equal parts of wine and water. The former of the&s;e by its &s;timulus &s;eemed to decrea&s;e his languor for a time, and the latter to &s;trengthen his returning power of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>The daily exacerbations or remi&s;&s;ions were ob&s;cure, and not well attended to; but he appeared to be wor&s;e on the fourteenth or fifteenth days, as his pul&s;e was then quicke&s;t, and his inattention greate&s;t; and he began to g$t better on the twentieth or twenty-fir&s;t days of his di&s;ea&s;e; for the pul&s;e then became le&s;s frequent, and his &s;kin cooler, and he took rather more food: the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;eemed to ob&s;erve the quarter periods of lunation.</P>

<P N="1">1. When the &s;tomach is primarily affected with torpor not by de|fect of &s;timulus, but in con&s;equence of the previous exhau&s;tion of its &s;en&s;orial power; and not &s;econdarily by its a&s;&s;ociation with other torpid parts; it &s;eems to be the general cau&s;e of the weak pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries, and the con&s;equent increa&s;ed action of the capillaries, which con&s;titute continued fever with weak pul&s;e. In this &s;ituation if the patient recovers, it is owing to the renovation of life in the torpid &s;tomach, as happens to the whole &s;y&s;tem in winter|&s;leeping animals. If he peri&s;hes, it is owing to the exhau&s;tion of the body for want of nouri&s;hment occa&s;ioned by indige&s;tion; which is ha&s;tened by the increa&s;ed actions of the capillaries and ab|&s;orbents.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the &s;tomach is primarily affected by defect of &s;timulus, as by cold or hunger; or &s;econdarily by defect of the power of a&s;&s;o|ciation, as in intermittent fevers; or la&s;tly in con&s;equence of the in|troduction of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation, as in inflammatory di&s;|ea&s;es; the actions of the heart and arteries are not dimini&s;hed, as when the &s;tomach is primarily affected with torpor by its previous exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power, but become greatly increa&s;ed, pro|ducing irritative or inflammatory fever. Where this fever is conti|nued, though with &s;ome remi&s;&s;ions and exacerbations, the exce&s;&s;ive action is at length &s;o much le&s;&s;ened by expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power, as to gradually terminate in health; or it becomes totally ex|hau&s;ted, and death &s;ucceeds the de&s;truction of the irritability and a&s;|&s;ociability of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is al&s;o another termination of the di&s;ea&s;es in con&s;equence of great torpor of the &s;tomach, which are not always termed fevers;

one of the&s;e is attended with &s;o great and univer&s;al torpor, that the patient dies in the fir&s;t cold fit; that is, within twelve hours or le&s;s of the fir&s;t &s;eizure; this is commonly termed &s;udden death. But the quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e, and the coldne&s;s with &s;huddering, and with &s;ick &s;tomach, di&s;tingui&s;hed a ca&s;e, which I lately &s;aw, from the &s;udden deaths occa&s;ioned by apoplexy, or ruptured blood-ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>In hemicrania I believe the &s;tomach is always affected &s;econdarily, as no quickne&s;s of pul&s;e generally attends it, and as the &s;tomach re|covers its activity in about two whole days. But in the following ca&s;e, which I &s;aw la&s;t week, I &s;uppo&s;e the &s;tomach &s;uddenly be|came paralytic, and cau&s;ed in about a week the death of the patient. Mi&s;s&mdash;, a fine young lady about nineteen, had bathed a few times, about a month before, in a cold &s;pring, and was always much indi&s;po&s;ed after it; &s;he was &s;eized with &s;ickne&s;s, and cold &s;huddering, with very quick pul&s;e, which was &s;ucceeded by a violent hot fit; during the next cold paroxy&s;m &s;he had a convul&s;ion fit; and after that &s;ymptoms of in&s;anity, &s;o as to &s;trike and bite the attendants, and to &s;peak furious language; the &s;ame circum&s;tances occurred during a third fit, in which I believe a &s;trait wai&s;tcoat was put on, and &s;ome blood taken from her; during all this time her &s;tomach would receive no nutriment, except once or twice a little wine and water. On the &s;eventh day of the di&s;ea&s;e, when I &s;aw her, the extre|mities were cold, the pul&s;e not to be counted, and &s;he was unable to &s;wallow, or to &s;peak; a cly&s;ter was u&s;ed with turpentine and mu&s;k and opium, with warm fomentations, but &s;he did not recover from that cold fit.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the convul&s;ion fit and the in&s;anity &s;eem to have been violent efforts to relieve the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation of the paralytic &s;tomach; and the quick pul&s;e, and returning fits of torpor and of orga&s;m, evinced the di&s;ea&s;e to be attended with fever, though it might have been called anorexia maniacalis, or epileptica.</P>

<P>If this experiment be again tried on the human &s;ubject, it &s;hould be &s;o contrived, that the blood in pa&s;&s;ing from the well per&s;on to the &s;ick one &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to the air; it &s;hould not be cooled or heated; and it &s;hould be mea&s;ured; all which may be done in the following manner. Procure two &s;ilver pipes, each about an inch long, in the form of funnels, wide at top, with a tail beneath, the former &s;omething wider than a &s;wan-quill, and the latter le&s;s than a &s;mall crow-quill. Fix one of the&s;e &s;ilver funnels by its wide end to one end of the gut of a chicken fre&s;h killed about four or &s;ix inches long, and the other to the other end of the gut; then introduce the &s;mall end of one funnel into the vein of the arm of a well per&s;on downwards towards the hand; and laying the gut with the other end on a water-plate heated to 98 degrees in a very warm room, let the blood run through it. Then pre&s;&s;ing the finger on the gut near the arm of the well per&s;on, &s;lide it along &s;o as to pre&s;s out one gut|ful into a cup, in order to a&s;certain the quantity by weight. Then introduce the other end of the other funnel into a &s;imilar vein in the arm of the &s;ick per&s;on upwards towards the &s;houlder; and by &s;liding one finger, and then another reciprocally, along the chicken's gut, &s;o as to compre&s;s it, from the arm of the well per&s;on to the arm of the &s;ick one, the blood may be mea&s;ured, and thus the exact quantity known which is given and received.

<HEAD><HI>XV.</HI> Inflammation excited in fever.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. When the actions of any part of the &s;y&s;tem of capillaries are excited to a certain degree, &s;en&s;ation is produced, along with a greater quantity of heat, as mentioned in the fifth article of this &s;upplement. When this increa&s;ed capillary action becomes &s;till more energetic, by the combined &s;en&s;orial powers of &s;en&s;ation with irritation, new fibres are &s;ecreted, or new fluids, (which harden into fibres like the mucus &s;ecreted by the &s;ilk-worm, or &s;pider, or pinna,) from which new ve&s;&s;els are con&s;tructed; it is then termed inflammation: if this exi&s;ts in the capillary ve&s;&s;els of the cellular membrane or &s;kin only, with feeble pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries, the febris &s;en&s;itiva inirritata, or malignant fever, occurs; if the coats of the arteries are al&s;o in|flamed, the febris &s;en&s;itiva irritata, or inflammatory fever, exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e fevers the part inflamed is called a phlegmon, and by its violent actions excites &s;o much pain, that is, &s;o much of the &s;en|&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation, as to produce more violent actions, and in|flammation, throughout the whole &s;y&s;tem. Whence great heat from the excited capillaries of the &s;kin, large and quick pul&s;ations of the heart, full and hard arteries, with great univer&s;al &s;ecretions and ab&s;orptions. The&s;e perpetually continue, though with exacerba|tions and remi&s;&s;ions; which &s;eem to be governed by &s;olar or lunar influence.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this &s;ituation there generally, I &s;uppo&s;e, exi&s;ts an increa&s;ed activity of the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els of the brain, and con&s;equently an in|crea&s;ed production of &s;en&s;orial power; in le&s;s violent quantity of this di&s;ea&s;e however the increa&s;e of the action of the heart and arteries may be owing &s;imply to the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;o|ciation in the &s;tomach, when that organ is affected by &s;ympathy with &s;ome inflamed part. In the &s;ame manner as the capillaries are violently
<PB N="607" REF="6150">
and permanently actuated by the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in the heart and arteries, when the &s;tomach is affected primarily by contagious matter, and the heart and arteries &s;e|condarily. Thus I &s;u&s;pect, that in the di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox the &s;tomach is affected &s;econdarily by &s;ympathy with the infected ton&s;ils or ino|culated arm; but that in the confluent &s;mall-pox the &s;tomach is affected primarily, as well as the ton&s;ils, by contagious matter mixed with the &s;aliva, and &s;wallowed.</P>
<P N="3">3. In inflammatory fevers with great arterial action, as the &s;tomach is not always affected with torpor, and as there is a direct &s;ympathy between the &s;tomach and heart, &s;ome people have believed, that nau|&s;eating do&s;es of &s;ome emetic drug, as of antimonium tartarizatum, have been admini&s;tered with advantage, abating by direct &s;ympathy the actions of the heart. This theory is not ill founded, and the u&s;e of digitalis, given in &s;mall do&s;es, as from half a dram to a dram of the &s;aturated tincture, two or three times a day, as well as other le&s;s violent emetic drugs, would be worth the attention of ho&s;pital phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Sickne&s;s might al&s;o be produced probably with advantage by whirl|ing the patient in a chair &s;u&s;pended from the cieling by two parallel cords; which after being revolved fifty or one hundred times in one direction, would return with great circular velocity, and produce vertigo, &s;imilar I &s;uppo&s;e to &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s. And la&s;tly the &s;ickne&s;s produced by re&s;piring an atmo&s;phere mixed with one tenth of carbo|nated hydrogen, di&s;covered by Mr. Watt, and publi&s;hed by Dr. Beddoes, would be well worthy exact and repeated experiment.</P>
<P N="4">4. Cool air, cool fomentations, or ablutions, are al&s;o u&s;eful in this inflammatory fever; as by cooling the particles of blood in the cutaneous and pulmonary ve&s;&s;els, they mu&s;t return to the heart with le&s;s &s;timulus, than when they are heated above the natural degree of ninety-eight.
<PB N="608" REF="6160">
For this purpo&s;e &s;now and ice have been &s;cattered on the patients in Italy; and cold bathing has been u&s;ed at the eruption of the &s;mall pox in China, and both, it is &s;aid, with advantage. See Cla&s;s III. 2. 1. 12. and Suppl. I. 8.</P>
<P N="5">5. The lancet however with repeated mild cathartics is the great agent in de&s;troying this enormous excitement of the &s;y&s;tem, &s;o long as the &s;trength of the patient will admit of evacuations. Bli&s;ters over the painful part, where the phlegmon or topical inflammation is &s;ituated, after great evacuation, is of evident &s;ervice, as in pleuri&s;y. Warm bathing for half an hour twice a day, when the patient becomes enfeebled, is of great benefit, as in peripneumony and rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P N="6">6. When other means fail of &s;ucce&s;s in abating the violent ex|citement of the &s;y&s;tem in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, might not the &s;haved head be covered with large bladders of cold water, in which ice or &s;alt had been recently di&s;&s;olved; and changed as often as nece&s;&s;ary, till the brain is rendered in &s;ome degree torpid by cold?&mdash;Might not a greater degree of cold, as iced water, or &s;now, be applied to the cutaneous capillaries?</P>
<P N="7">7. Another experiment I have frequently wi&s;hed to try, which cannot be done in private practice, and which I therefore recommend to &s;ome ho&s;pital phy&s;ician; and that is, to endeavour to &s;till the violent actions of the heart and arteries, after due evacuations by vene&s;ection and cathartics, by gently compre&s;&s;ing the brain. This might be done by &s;u&s;pending a bed, &s;o as to whirl the patient round with his head mo&s;t di&s;tant from the center of motion, as if he lay acro&s;s a mill|&s;tone, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XVIII. 20. For this purpo&s;e a perpen|dicular &s;haft armed with iron gudgeons might have one end pa&s;s
<PB N="609" REF="6170">
into the floor, and the other into a beam in the cieling, with an hori|zontal arm, to which a &s;mall bed might be readily &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>By thus whirling the patient with increa&s;ing velocity &s;leep might be produced, and probably the violence of the actions of the heart and arteries might be dimini&s;hed in inflammatory fevers; and, as it is believed, that no accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power would &s;ucceed a torpor of the origin of the nerves, either thus procured by mechanical compre&s;&s;ion, or by the bladder-cap of cold water above de&s;cribed, the lives of thou&s;ands might probably be &s;aved by thus extingui&s;hing the exacerbations of febrile paroxy&s;ms, or preventing the returns of them.</P>
<P>In fevers with weak pul&s;e &s;leep, or a degree of &s;tupor, thus pro|duced, might prevent the too great expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power, and thus contribute to pre&s;erve the patient. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 5. 10. on &s;tupor. What might be the con&s;equence of whirling a per&s;on with his head next the center of motion, &s;o as to force the blood from the brain into the other parts of the body, might be di&s;covered by cau|tious experiment without danger, and might probably add to our ability of curing fever.</P>

<HEAD>XVI. <HI>Recapitulation.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The &s;en&s;orial power cau&s;es the contraction of the fibres, and is excited into action by four different circum&s;tances, by the &s;timulus of external bodies, by pain or plea&s;ure, by de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, or by the previous motions of other contracting fibres. In the fir&s;t &s;ituation it is called the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, in the &s;econd the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation, in the third the &s;en&s;orial power of volition, and in the fourth the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>Many parts of the body are excited into perpetual action, as the &s;anguiferous ve&s;&s;els con&s;i&s;ting of the heart, arteries, and veins; others
<PB N="610" REF="6180">
into nearly perpetual action, as the conglomerate and capillary glands; and others into actions &s;till &s;omewhat le&s;s frequent, as the alimentary canal, and the lacteal and lymphatic ab&s;orbents with their conglobate glands: all the&s;e are principally actuated by the &s;en&s;orial powers of ir|ritation, and of a&s;&s;ociation; but in &s;ome degree or at &s;ome times by tho&s;e of &s;en&s;ation, and even of volition. There are three kinds of &s;timulus, which may ea&s;ily be occa&s;ionally dimini&s;hed, that of heat on the &s;kin, of food in the &s;tomach, and of the oxygenous part of the atmo&s;phere, which mixes with the blood in re&s;piration, and &s;timulates the heart and arteries.</P>
<P N="2">2. When any parts, which are naturally excited into perpetual ac|tion by &s;timulus, become torpid or le&s;s active from decrea&s;e of that &s;timulus; there fir&s;t occurs a decrea&s;e of the activity of the parts next catenated with them; thus going into cold water produces a torpor of the capillary ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, as is known by the difficult re&s;piration, which immediately occurs; for the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which naturally contributes to actuate the lungs, is now le&s;s excited by the decrea&s;ed actions of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els, with which they are catenated. This con&s;titutes the cold fit of fever.</P>
<P>There next occurs an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation in the parts, which were torpid from defect of &s;timulus, as the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els for in&s;tance when expo&s;ed to cold air; and a &s;imilar accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation occurs in the parts which were catenated with the for|mer, as the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs in the example above men|tioned. Whence, if the &s;ubduction of &s;timulus has not been too great, &s;o as to impair the health of the part, the activity of the irri|tative motions returns, even though the &s;timulus continues le&s;s than u&s;ual; and tho&s;e of the a&s;&s;ociate motions become con&s;iderably in|crea&s;ed, becau&s;e the&s;e latter are now excited by the previous fibrous
<PB N="611" REF="6190">
motions, which now act as &s;trong or &s;tronger than formerly, and have al&s;o acquired an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ocia|tion. This accounts for the curious event of our becoming warm in a minute or two after remaining in water of about 80 degrees of heat, as in the bath at Buxton; or in the cold air of a fro&s;ty morning of about 30 degrees of heat.</P>
<P>But if the parts thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the accumulated &s;en&s;orial powers of irritation and of a&s;&s;ociation be expo&s;ed again to their natural quan|tity of &s;timulus, a great exce&s;s of activity &s;upervenes; becau&s;e the fibres, which po&s;&s;e&s;s accumulated irritation, are now excited by their u&s;ual quantity of &s;timulus; and tho&s;e which po&s;&s;e&s;s accumulated a&s;|&s;ociation, are now excited by double or treble the quantity of the preceding irritative fibrous motions, with which they are catenated; this con&s;titutes the hot fit of fever.</P>
<P>Another important circum&s;tance occurs, when the parts, which are torpid from decrea&s;ed &s;timulus, do not accumulate a quantity of &s;en&s;orial power &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e of renewing their own na|tural quantity of action; but are neverthele&s;s not &s;o torpid, as to have the life of the part impaired. In this &s;ituation the &s;uperabundance of the accumulated power of irritation contributes to actuate the a&s;&s;o|ciate motions next catenated with them. Thus, when a per&s;on breathes air with le&s;s oxygene than natural, as by covering his head in bed, and thus re&s;piring the &s;ame atmo&s;phere repeatedly, the heart and arteries become le&s;s active by defect of the &s;timulus of oxygene; and then the accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power of irritation becomes in&s;tantly very great, as the&s;e organs are &s;ubject to perpetual and energetic action. This accumulation neverthele&s;s is not &s;o great as to renew their own activity under this defect of &s;timulus, but yet is in &s;ufficient abundance to increa&s;e the a&s;&s;ociability of the next link of catenation, that is, to actuate the capillaries of the &s;kin with great and perpetual increa&s;e of energy. This re&s;embles continued fever with weak-pul&s;e; in which the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power
<PB N="612" REF="6200">
cau&s;ed by the le&s;&s;ened motions of the heart and arteries, actuates the capillaries with increa&s;e of energy.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which is cau&s;ed as above explained by deficient excitement owing to the le&s;&s;ened quantity of action of the irritative fibrous motions, with which the a&s;&s;ociate train is catenated, is not in quantity &s;ufficient to renew the natural actions of the fir&s;t link of an a&s;&s;ociate train of mo|tions; it is neverthele&s;s frequently &s;o abundant as to actuate the next link of the a&s;&s;ociated train with unnatural energy by increa&s;ing its a&s;|&s;ociability; and that in a &s;till greater degree if that &s;econd link of the a&s;&s;ociated train was previou&s;ly in a torpid &s;tate, that is, had previ|ou&s;ly acquired &s;ome accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ocia|tion. This important circum&s;tance of the animal economy is worthy our mo&s;t accurate attention. Thus if the heart and arteries are de|prived of their due quantity of the &s;timulus of oxygene in the blood, a weak and quick pul&s;e enfues, with an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation; next follows an increa&s;e of the action of the capillaries by the &s;uperabundance of this accumulated power of irrita|tion; but there al&s;o exi&s;ts an accumulation of the power of a&s;&s;ocia|tion in the&s;e acting capillaries, which is not now excited by the de|ficient actions of the heart and arteries; but which by its abundance contributes to actuate the next link of a&s;&s;ociation, which is the &s;ick &s;tomach in the ca&s;e related from Sydenham in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 2. and explained in this Supplement I. 4. And as this &s;ick &s;tomach was in a previous &s;tate of torpor, it might at the &s;ame time po&s;&s;e&s;s an accu|mulation of &s;ome &s;en&s;orial power, which, if it was of a&s;&s;ociation, would be thus more powerfully excited by the increa&s;ed actions of the ca|pillaries; which exi&s;ted in con&s;equence of the weak action of the heart and arteries. This al&s;o re&s;embles in &s;ome re&s;pects the continued fevers with weak pul&s;e, and with increa&s;ed activity of the capillaries.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="613" REF="6210">
4. When a torpor of &s;ome irritative motions occurs from a previ|ous exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation by the action of &s;ome very great &s;timulus, it is long before any accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation is produced; as is experienced in the &s;ickne&s;s and languor, which continues a whole day after a fit of drunkenne&s;s. But neverthele&s;s there occurs an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in the fir&s;t link of the a&s;&s;ociate train of motions, which is catenated with the&s;e torpid irritative ones; which accumulation is owing to deficient excitement of that &s;en&s;orial power in the fir&s;t link of the a&s;&s;ociate train. This fir&s;t link therefore exi&s;ts al&s;o in a le&s;s active or torpid &s;tate, but the accumulation of the &s;en|&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation by its &s;uperabundance contributes to ac|tuate the &s;econd link of the a&s;&s;ociate train with unnatural quantity of motion; and that though its own natural quantity of the power of a&s;&s;ociation is not excited by the deficient action of preceding fibrous motions.</P>
<P>When this happens to the &s;tomach, as after its irritative motions have been much exerted from the unnatural &s;timulus of wine, or opium, or of contagious matter mixed with the &s;aliva, a torpor or inactivity of it &s;ucceeds for a greater or le&s;s length of time; as no accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation can occur, till the natural quantity, which has been previou&s;ly expended, is fir&s;t re&s;tored. Then the heart and arteries, which are next in catenation, become le&s;s active from the want of &s;ufficient excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which previou&s;ly contributed to actuate them. This &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation therefore becomes accumulated, and by its &s;uperabundance contributes to actuate the link next in a&s;|&s;ociation, which has thus acquired &s;o great a degree of a&s;&s;ociability, as to overbalance the le&s;s quantity of the excitement of it by the torpid action of the previous or fir&s;t a&s;&s;ociate link. This happens to the capillaries, when the heart and arteries are affected as above by the torpor of the &s;tomach, when it is occa&s;ioned by previous grea$
<PB N="614" REF="6220">
expenditure of its &s;en&s;orial power, and thus con&s;titutes fever with weak pul&s;e, which is here termed inirritative fever, typhus mitior.</P>
<P N="5">5. When a deficiency of &s;timulus is too great or too long con|tinued, &s;o as to impair the life of the part, no further accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power occurs; as when the &s;kin is long expo&s;ed to cold and damp air. In that ca&s;e the link in catenation, that is, the fir&s;t of the a&s;&s;ociate train, is rendered torpid by defect of excitement of its u&s;ual quantity of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, and from there being no accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation to increa&s;e its a&s;&s;ociability, and thus to contribute to actuate it by overbalanc|ing the defect of the excitement of its a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>Thus on riding long and &s;lowly on a cold and damp day, the ex|halation of the vapour, which is impinged on the &s;kin, as the tra|veller proceeds, carries away his warmth fa&s;ter, than it is generated within the &s;y&s;tem; and thus the capillaries of the &s;kin have their actions &s;o much impaired after a time, that no accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation occurs; and then the &s;tomach, who&s;e motions are catenated with tho&s;e of the capillaries, cea&s;es to act from the deficient excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation; and indige&s;tion and flatulency &s;ucceed, in&s;tead of the increa&s;ed dige&s;tion and hunger, which occur, when the cutaneous capillaries are expo&s;ed to a le&s;s de|gree of cold, and for a &s;horter time. In which latter &s;ituation the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation increa&s;es by its &s;uperabundance the a&s;&s;ociability of the fibres of the &s;tomach, &s;o as to overbalance the defect of the excitement of their a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;tomach is affected &s;econdarily in fevers with &s;trong pul&s;e, as in tho&s;e with weak pul&s;e it is affected primarily. To illu&s;trate this doctrine I &s;hall relate the following ca&s;e of Mr. Y&mdash;. He was a young man rather intemperate in the u&s;e of wine or beer, and
<PB N="615" REF="6230">
was &s;eized with a cold fit, and with a con&s;equent hot one with &s;trong pul&s;e; on examining his hypochondrium an oblong tumour was di&s;tinctly felt on the left &s;ide of the &s;tomach, which extended &s;ix or eight inches downward, and was believed to be a tumour of the &s;pleen, which thus occa&s;ioned by its torpor the cold fit and con&s;e|quent hot fit of fever with &s;trong pul&s;e. This fever continued, though with remi&s;&s;ions, for two or three weeks; and the patient re|peatedly lo&s;t blood, u&s;ed cathartics with calomel and &s;ena, and had fre|quent antimonial and &s;aline medicines. And after he was much weakened by evacuations, the peruvian bark and &s;mall do&s;es of &s;teel removed the fever, but the tumour remained many years during the remainder of his life.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the tumour of the &s;pleen was occa&s;ioned by the torpor of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els; while the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els continued &s;ome|what longer to pour their fluids into the cells of it. Then the inactivity of this vi&s;cus affected the whole &s;y&s;tem with torpor by the deficient ex|citement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, which contributes along with the irritation cau&s;ed by their &s;pecific &s;timuli to actuate the whole &s;anguiferous, &s;ecerning, and ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els; and along with the&s;e the &s;tomach, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es perhaps greater mobility, or promptitude to torpor or to orga&s;m, than any other part. And after a time all the&s;e parts recover their actions by the accumulation of their &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation. But the &s;pleen not recovering its action from the accumulation of its power of irritation, as ap|peared from the continuance of the tumor, &s;till affects the &s;tomach by its defective irritative motions cea&s;ing to excite the a&s;&s;ociation, which ought to contribute to actuate it.</P>
<P>Hence the &s;tomach continues torpid in re&s;pect to its motions, but accumulates its power of a&s;&s;ociation; which is not excited into ac|tion by the defective motions of the &s;pleen; this accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation now by its &s;uperabundance actuates the next link of a&s;&s;ociate motions, which con&s;i&s;ts of the heart and arteries,
<PB N="616" REF="6240">
into greater energy of action than natural, and thus cau&s;es fever with &s;trong pul&s;e; which, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be mo&s;t fre|quently excited by increa&s;e of irritation, is called irritative fever or &s;ynocha.</P>
<P>Similar to this in the &s;mall pox, which is given by inoculation, the &s;tomach is affected &s;econdarily, when the fever commences; and hence in this &s;mall-pox the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries are frequently &s;tronger than natural, but never weaker, for the rea&s;ons above given. Whereas in that &s;mall-pox, which is cau&s;ed by the &s;tomach being primarily affected, by the contagious matter being &s;wallowed with the &s;aliva, whether the ton&s;ils are at the &s;ame time affected or not, the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries become weak, and the inirritative fever is produced, as explained above, along with the confluent &s;mall-pox. This unfolds the cau&s;e of the mildne&s;s of the inoculated &s;mall-pox; becau&s;e in this di&s;ea&s;e the &s;tomach is af|fected &s;econdarily, whereas in the natural &s;mall-pox it is frequently af|fected primarily by &s;wallowing the contagious matter mixed with &s;aliva.</P>
<P>In the mea&s;les I &s;uppo&s;e the contagious matter to be di&s;&s;olved in the air, and therefore not liable to be mixed with the &s;aliva; where|as the variolous matter is probably only diffu&s;ed in the air, and thence more readily mixed with the &s;aliva in the mouth during re&s;piration. This difference appears more probable, as the &s;mall-pox I believe is always taken at a le&s;s di&s;tance from the di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on than is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to acquire the mea&s;les. The contagion of the mea&s;les affects the membranes of the no&s;trils, and the &s;ecretion of tears in con&s;e|quence, but never I &s;u&s;pect the &s;tomach primarily, but always &s;e|condarily; whence the pul&s;ation of the heart and arteries is always &s;tronger than natural, &s;o as to bear the lancet at any period of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The great mildne&s;s &s;ometimes, and fatality at other times, of the &s;carlet fever may depend on the &s;ame circum&s;tance; that is, on the &s;tomach being primarily or &s;econdarily affected by the contagious
<PB N="617" REF="6250">
matter, ob&s;erving that the ton&s;ils may be affected at the &s;ame time with the &s;tomach. Should this prove to be the ca&s;e, which future ob&s;ervations mu&s;t determine, what certain advantage mu&s;t ari&s;e from the inoculation of this di&s;ea&s;e! When it is received by the &s;kin pri|marily I &s;uppo&s;e no &s;ore throat attends it, nor fever with weak pul&s;e; when it is received by the &s;tomach primarily, the ton&s;ils are affected at the &s;ame time, and the torpor of the &s;tomach produces in|irritative fever, and the mortification of the ton&s;ils &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>We may hence conclude, that when the torpor of the &s;tomach is either owing to defect of &s;timulus, which is not &s;o great as to impair the life of the part, as in moderate hunger, or in &s;wallowing iced water, or when its torpor is induced by its catenation or a&s;&s;ociation with other torpid parts, as in the commencement of intermittent fevers, and inoculated &s;mall-pox, that the &s;ub&s;equent action of the heart and arteries is generally increa&s;ed, producing irritative fever. Wh$ch is owing to the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irrita|tion in one ca&s;e, and of a&s;&s;ociation in the other, contributing to actuate the next link of the catenated or a&s;&s;ociated motions. But when the torpor of the &s;tomach is induced by previous exhau&s;tion of its &s;en&s;orial powers of irritation or of a&s;&s;ociation by continued violent action, as by the &s;timulus of digitalis, or of contagious matter, or after intoxication from wine or opium, a weaker action of the heart and arteries &s;ucceeds, becau&s;e there is no accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power, and a deficient excitement of a&s;&s;ociation. And finally, as this weak action of the heart and arteries is not induced by exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power, but by defect of the excitement of a&s;&s;ociation, the accumulation of this power of a&s;&s;ociation increa&s;es the action of the capillaries, and thus induces inirritative fever.</P>
<P N="7">7. When any part of the &s;y&s;tem acts very violently in fevers, the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation is excited, which increa&s;es the actions of the moving &s;y&s;tem; whereas the pain, which ari&s;es from decrea&s;ed
<PB N="618" REF="6260">
irritative motions, as in hemicrania, &s;eems to exhau&s;t a quantity of &s;en&s;orial power, without producing or increa&s;ing any fibrous actions.</P>
<P>When the &s;tomach is primarily affected, as in inirritative fevers from contagion, and in &s;uch a manner as to occa&s;ion pain, the action of the capillaries &s;eems to be increa&s;ed by this additional &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation, whence exten&s;ive inflammation or mortification; but when the &s;tomach and con&s;equently the heart and arteries conti|nue their torpidity of action; as in confluent &s;mall-pox, and fatal &s;carlatina; this con&s;titutes &s;en&s;itive inirritative fever, or typhus gravior.</P>
<P>But when the &s;tomach is &s;econdarily affected, if the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation is excited, as in pleuri&s;y or peripneumony, the ac|tions of the heart and arteries are violently increa&s;ed, and of all the moving &s;y&s;tem along with them. Thus the peripneumony is gene|rally induced by the patient re&s;piring very cold air, and this e&s;pe|cially after being long confined to warm air, or after being much fa|tigued and heated by exce&s;&s;ive labour or exerci&s;e. For we can cover the &s;kin with more clothes, when we feel our&s;elves cold; but the lungs not having the perception of cold, we do not think of covering them, nor have the power to cover them, if we de&s;ired it; and the torpor, thus produced is greater, or of longer duration, in pro|portion to the previous expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power by heat or ex|erci&s;e.</P>
<P>This torpor of the lungs affects the &s;kin with &s;huddering, and the &s;tomach is al&s;o &s;econdarily affected; next follows the violent action of the lungs from the accumulation of the power of irritation, and an inflammation of them follows this violent action. While the &s;to|mach recovers its activity by the increa&s;e of the excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, and along with it the heart and arteries, and the whole moving &s;y&s;tem. Hence this inflammation occurs during the hot fit of fever, and no cold fit &s;ucceeds, becau&s;e the
<PB N="619" REF="6270">
exce&s;s of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation prevents a &s;ucceeding torpor.</P>
<P>The&s;e new motions of certain parts of the &s;y&s;tem produce increa&s;ed &s;ecretions of nutritious or organic mucus, which forms new ve&s;&s;els; the&s;e new ve&s;&s;els by their unu&s;ual motions produce new kinds of fluids; which are termed contagious, becau&s;e they have the power, when introduced into a healthy body, of producing &s;imilar actions and effects, with or without fever, as in the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, or in the itch and venereal di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>If any of the&s;e contagious matters affect the &s;tomach with torpor either by their &s;timulus immediately applied, or by its &s;ympathy with the parts fir&s;t di&s;ea&s;ed, a fever is produced with &s;ickne&s;s and want of appetite; as in &s;mall-pox, and &s;carlatina. If the &s;tomach is not affected by contagious matter, no fever &s;ucceeds, as in itch, tinea, &s;yphilis.</P>
<P>All the&s;e contagious matters are conceived to be harmle&s;s, till they have been expo&s;ed to the air, either openly or through a moi&s;t membrane; from which they are believed to acquire oxygene, and thence to become &s;ome kinds of animal acids. As the preparations of mercury cure venereal ulcers; as a quarter of a grain of &s;ublimate di&s;&s;olved in wine, and given thrice a day; this effect &s;eems to be pro|duced either by its &s;timulating the ab&s;orbents in the ulcer to ab&s;orb the venereal matter before it has acquired oxygene; or by afterwards uniting with it chemically, and again depriving it of its acquired acidity. On either &s;uppo&s;ition it might probably be given with ad|vantage in &s;mall-pox, and in all infectious di&s;ea&s;es, both previous to their commencement, and during their whole progre&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">8. The cold fits of intermittent fevers are cau&s;ed by the torpor of &s;ome part owing to deficient irritation, and of the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem from deficient a&s;&s;ociation. The hot fits are owing fir&s;t to the accumulation of irritation in the part primarily affected, if it recovers
<PB N="620" REF="6280">
its action, which does not always happen; and &s;econdly to the accu|mulation of a&s;&s;ociation in the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, which during health are &s;ubject to perpetual action; and la&s;tly al&s;o to the greater excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation, when the part primarily af|fected recovers its irritability, and acts with greater energy than na|tural.</P>
<P>The deficient &s;ecretions in the cold fit depend on the torpor of the glandular &s;y&s;tem; and the increa&s;ed &s;ecretions in the hot fit on their more energetic action. The thir&s;t in the cold fit is owing to the de|ficient ab&s;orption from the &s;kin, cellular membrane, and bladder; the thir&s;t in the hot fit is owing to the too great di&s;&s;ipation of the aqueous part of the blood. The urine is pale and in &s;mall quanity in the cold fit from deficient &s;ecretion of it, and from deficient ab&s;orp|tion of its aqueous parts; it is high coloured, and &s;ometimes depo&s;its a &s;ediment, in the hot fit from the greater &s;ecretion of it in the kid|neys, and the greater ab&s;orption of its aqueous and &s;aline part in the bladder. The dryne&s;s and &s;curf on the tongue and no&s;trils is owing to the increa&s;ed heat of the air expired from the lungs, and con&s;equent greater evaporation of the aqueous part of the mucus. The &s;weats ap|pear in con&s;equence of the declen&s;ion of the hot fit, owing to the ab&s;or|bent ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin lo&s;ing their increa&s;ed action &s;ooner than the &s;e|cerning ones; and to the evaporation le&s;&s;ening as the &s;kin becomes cooler. The returns of the paroxy&s;ms are principally owing to the torpor of &s;ome le&s;s e&s;&s;ential part of the &s;y&s;tem remaining after the termination of the la&s;t fit; and are al&s;o dependent on &s;olar or lunar diurnal periods.</P>
<P>The torpor of the part, which induces the cold paroxy&s;m, is ow|ing to deficient irritation occa&s;ioned either by the &s;ubduction of the natural &s;timuli of food, or water, or pure air, or by deficiency of ex|ternal influences, as of heat, or of &s;olar or lunar gravitation. Or &s;e|condly, in con&s;equence of the exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power by great previous exertions of &s;ome parts of the &s;y&s;tem, as of the limbs by
<PB N="621" REF="6290">
great labour or exerci&s;e, or of the &s;tomach by great &s;timulus, as by contagious matter &s;wallowed with the &s;aliva, or by much wine or opium previou&s;ly taken into it. Or la&s;tly a torpor of a part may be occa&s;ioned by &s;ome mechanic injury, as by a compre&s;|&s;ion of the nerves of the part, or of their origin in the brain; as the &s;itting long with one leg cro&s;&s;ed over the other occa&s;ions numb|ne&s;s, and as a torpor of the &s;tomach with vomiting frequently pre|cedes paralytic &s;trokes of the limbs.</P>
<P>As &s;leep is produced, either by defect of &s;timulus, or by previous exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power; &s;o the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of volition in tho&s;e mu&s;cles and organs of &s;en&s;e, which are ge|nerally obedient to it, awakens the &s;leeping per&s;on; when it has in|crea&s;ed the quantity of voluntarity &s;o much as to overbalance the de|fect of &s;timulus in one ca&s;e, and the exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power in the other; which latter requires a much longer time of &s;leep than the former. So the cold paroxy&s;m of fever is produced either by de|fect of &s;timulus, or by previous exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;ome part of the &s;y&s;tem; and the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation in that part renews the action of it, when it has increa&s;ed its irritability &s;o much as to overbalance the defect of &s;timulus in one ca&s;e, and the exhau&s;tion of &s;en&s;orial power in the other; which latter requires a much longer torpor or cold fit than the former.</P>
<P>But in the cold paroxy&s;m of fever be&s;ides the torpor of one part of the &s;y&s;tem from defect of irritation, the remainder of it becomes tor|pid owing to defect of excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation by the le&s;&s;ened action of the part fir&s;t affected. This torpor of the general &s;y&s;tem remains, till the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation has increa&s;ed the a&s;&s;ociability &s;o much as to overbalance the defect of the excitement of a&s;&s;ociation; then the torpor cea&s;es, and if the fir&s;t affected part has recovered its activity the other parts are all thrown into exce&s;s of action by their increa&s;ed a&s;&s;ociability, and the hot fit of fever is produced.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="622" REF="6300">
9. In the continued fevers with &s;trong pul&s;e the &s;tomach is af|fected &s;econdarily, and thus acts feebly from deficient excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation; but the accumulation of the power of a&s;|&s;ociation thus produced in an organ &s;ubject to perpetual and energetic action, is &s;o great as to affect the next link of the a&s;&s;ociate train, which con&s;i&s;ts of the heart and arteries; the&s;e therefore are exerted perpetually with increa&s;e of action.</P>
<P>In continued fevers with weak pul&s;e the torpid &s;tomach is affected primarily by previous exhau&s;tion of its irritability by &s;timulus, as of contagious matter &s;wallowed into it. The heart and arteries act feebly from deficient excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation, owing to the torpor of the &s;tomach, with which they are catenated; but the accumulation of the power of a&s;&s;ociation, thus produced in organs &s;ubject to perpetual and energetic motion, is &s;o great, as to affect the next link of the a&s;&s;ociate train; which con&s;i&s;ts of the capillaries of the &s;kin or other glands; the&s;e therefore are exerted perpetually with great increa&s;e of action.</P>
<P>The continued fevers with &s;trong pul&s;e terminate by the reduc|tion or exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power by violent action of the whole &s;y&s;tem; which is followed either by return of health with the natural quantity of irritability, and of a&s;&s;ociability, or by a total de|&s;truction of them both, and con&s;equent death.</P>
<P>In continued fevers with weak pul&s;e the &s;tomach remains torpid during the whole cour&s;e of the fever; and at length by the recovery of its irritability and &s;en&s;ibility effects the cure of it. Which gene|rally happens about the fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third quarter of the lunar pe|riod, counted from the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, or continues a whole lunation, and &s;ometimes more; which gave ri&s;e to what are termed critical days. See Sect. XXXVI. 4. on this &s;ubject. If the &s;tomach does not recover from its torpor, the patient becomes ema|ciated, and dies exhau&s;ted by the continuance of the increa&s;ed action of the capillaries and ab&s;orbents, and the want of nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="623" REF="6310">
The cure of continued fever with weak pul&s;e con&s;i&s;ts fir&s;t in weak|ening the undue action of the capillaries of the &s;kin by ablution with cold water from 32 to 80 degrees of heat; or by expo&s;ing them to cool air. Secondly by invigorating the actions of the &s;tomach, by de|crea&s;ing them for a time, and thence accumulating the power of irritation, as by an emetic, or by iced water, or iced wine. Or by increa&s;e of &s;timulus, as by bark, wine, opium, and food, in &s;mall quantities frequently repeated. Or by renewing the action of the &s;tomach by &s;light electric &s;hocks. Or by fomenting it frequently with water heated to 96 or 100 degrees. Or la&s;tly by exciting its power of a&s;&s;ociation with other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, as by a bli&s;ter; which &s;ucceeds be&s;t when the extremities are cool; or by &s;winging, as in vertigo rotatoria.</P>
<P>If by the &s;timulus of the Peruvian bark on the fibres of the &s;to|mach, they regain their due action, the heart and arteries al&s;o regain their due action; as their &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation is now excited, and expended as u&s;ual. And as there is then no accumulation of &s;en|&s;orial power in the heart and arteries, the capillaries cea&s;e to act with too great energy, and the fever is cured.</P>
<P>Thirdly. If the heart and arteries could be them&s;elves &s;ti|mulated into greater action, although the &s;tomach remained torpid, they might probably by expending a greater quantity of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation, prevent an accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation, (for the&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly be only different modes of action of the &s;pirit of animation,) and thus the too great action of the capillaries might be prevented and the fever cea&s;e. This new mode of cure might po&s;&s;ibly be accompli&s;hed, if the patient was to breathe a gallon or two of pure or diluted oxygene gas frequently in a day; which by pa&s;&s;ing through the moi&s;t membranes of the lungs and uniting with the blood might render it more &s;timulant, and thus excite the heart and arteries into greater action.</P>
<P>Fourthly. Greater energy might probably be given to the whole &s;y&s;tem, and particularly to tho&s;e parts which act too feebly in fevers,
<PB N="624" REF="6320">
as the &s;tomach and the heart and arteries, if the action of the &s;e|cerning ve&s;&s;els of the brain could be increa&s;ed in energy; th$s is pro|bably one effect of all tho&s;e drugs, which when given in large quan|tity induce intoxication, as wine and opium. And when given with great caution in &s;mall quantities uniformly rep$ated, as from three drops to five of the tincture of opium, but not more, every &s;ix hours, I believe they &s;upply an efficacious medicine in fevers with great arte|rial debility; and the more &s;o, if the Peruvian bark be exhibited al|ternately every &s;ix hours along with them. There are other means of exciting the ve&s;&s;els of the brain into action; as fir&s;t by decrea&s;ing the &s;timulus of heat by temporary cold fomentation; &s;econdly, in|crea&s;ing the &s;timulus of heat by long continued warm fomentation; thirdly, by electricity, as very &s;mall &s;hocks pa&s;&s;ed through it in all directions; and la&s;tly by bli&s;ters on the head. All tho&s;e require to be u&s;ed with great caution, and e&s;pecially where there exi&s;ts an evi|dent &s;tupor, as the removing of that is I believe frequently injurious. See &s;tupor, Cla&s;s I. 2. 5. 10.</P>
<P>The cure of fever with &s;trong pul&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in the repeated u&s;e of vene&s;ection, gentle cathartics, diluents; medicines producing &s;ick|ne&s;s, as antimonials, digitalis; or the re&s;piration of carbonated hydro|gen; or by re&s;piration of atmo&s;pheric air lowered by a mixture of hydrogen, azote, or carbonic acid gas, or by compre&s;&s;ing the brain by whirling in a decumbent po&s;ture, as if lying acro&s;s an hori|zontal mill-&s;tone. See the former parts of this &s;upplement for the methods of cure both of fevers with &s;trong and weak pul&s;e.</P>
<P N="10">10. When any difficulty occurs in determining the weak pul&s;e from the &s;trong one, it may generally be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by counting its fre|quency. For when an adult patient lies horizontally in a cool room, and is not hurried or alarmed by the approach of his phy&s;ician, nor &s;timulated by wine or opium, the &s;trong pul&s;e &s;eldom exceeds 118 or 120 in a minute; and the weak pul&s;e is generally not much below
<PB N="625" REF="6330">
130, and often much above that number. Secondly in &s;itting up in bed, or changing the horizontal to a perpendicular po&s;ture, the quick|ne&s;s of the weak pul&s;e is liable immediately to increa&s;e 10 or 20 pul&s;ations in a minute, which does not I believe occur in the &s;trong pul&s;e, when the patient has re&s;ted him&s;elf after the exertion of ri&s;ing.</P>

<P>Thus have I given an outline of what may be termed the &s;ympa|thetic theory of fevers, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the mechanic theory of Boerhaave, the &s;pa&s;modic theory of Hoffman and of Cullen, and the putrid theory of Pringle. What I have thus delivered, I beg to be con&s;idered rather as ob&s;ervations and conjectures, than as things ex|plained and demon&s;trated; to be con&s;idered as a foundation and a &s;caffolding, which may enable future indu&s;try to erect a &s;olid and a beautiful edifice, eminent both for its &s;implicity and utility, as well as for the permanency of its materials,&mdash;which may not moulder, like the &s;tructures already erected, into the &s;and of which they were compo&s;ed; but which may &s;tand unimpaired, like the Newtonian philo&s;ophy, a rock amid the wa&s;te of ages!</P>

<HEAD>ADDITION I.</HEAD>
<P>AT the end of the article Canities, in Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 11. plea&s;e to add the following:</P>
<P>As mechanical injury from a percu&s;&s;ion, or a wound, or a cau&s;tic, is liable to occa&s;ion the hair of the part to become grey; &s;o I &s;u&s;pect the compre&s;&s;ion of parts again&s;t each other of &s;ome animals in the womb is liable to render the hair of tho&s;e parts of a lighter colour; as &s;eems often to occur in black cats and dogs. A &s;mall terrier bitch now &s;tands by me, which is black on all tho&s;e parts, which were external, when &s;he was wrapped up in the uterus, teres atque rotunda; and tho&s;e parts white, which were mo&s;t con&s;tantly pre&s;&s;ed together; and tho&s;e parts tawny, which were generally but le&s;s con&s;tantly pre&s;&s;ed together. Thus the hair of the back from the forehead to the end of the tail is black, as well as that of the &s;ides, and external parts of the legs, both before and behind.</P>
<P>As in the uterus the chin of the whelp is bent down, and lies in contact with the fore part of the neck and brea&s;t; the tail is applied clo&s;e again&s;t the divi&s;ion of the thighs behind; the in&s;ide of the
<PB N="627" REF="6350">
hinder thighs are pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e to the &s;ides of the belly, all the&s;e parts have white hairs.</P>
<P>The fore-legs in the uterus lie on each &s;ide of the face; &s;o that the feet cover part of the temples, and compre&s;s the prominent part of the upper eye-brows, but are &s;o placed as to defend the eye-balls from pre&s;&s;ure; it is curious to ob&s;erve, that the hair of the &s;ides of the face, and of the prominent upper eye-brows, are tawny, and of the in&s;ide of the feet and legs, which covered them; for as this po&s;ture admitted of more change in the latter weeks of ge&s;tation, the colour of the&s;e parts is not &s;o far removed from black, as of tho&s;e parts, where the contact or compre&s;&s;ion was more uniform.</P>
<P>Where this uterine compre&s;&s;ion of parts has not been &s;o great as to render the hair white in other animals, it frequently happens, that the extremities of the body are white, as the feet, and no&s;es, and tips of the ears of dogs and cats and hor&s;es, where the circulation is naturally weaker; whence it would &s;eem, that the capillary glands, which form the hair, are impeded in the fir&s;t in&s;tance by compre&s;&s;ion, and in the la&s;t by the debility of the circulation in them. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 15.</P>
<P>This day, Augu&s;t 8th, 1794, I have &s;een a negro, who was born (as he reports) of black parents, both father and mother, at King&s;ton in Jamaica, who has many large white blotches on the &s;kin of his limbs and body; which I thought felt not &s;o &s;oft to the finger, as the black parts. He has a white divergent blaze from the &s;ummit of his no&s;e to the vertex of his head; the upper part of which, where it extends on the hairy &s;calp, has thick curled hair, like the other part of his head, but quite white. By the&s;e marks I &s;uppo&s;ed him to be the &s;ame black, who is de&s;cribed, when only two years old, in the Tran&s;actions of the American Philo&s;ophical Society, Vol. II. page 292, where a female one is likewi&s;e de&s;cribed with nearly &s;imilar marks.</P>
<P>The joining of the frontal bones, and the bregma, having been

later than that of the other &s;utures of the cranium, probably gave cau&s;e to the whitene&s;s of the hair on the&s;e parts by delaying or im|peding its growth.</P>

<P>The following extract from a letter of Dr. Beddoes on hydro|cephalus internus, I e&s;teem a valuable addition to the article on that &s;ubject at Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 12.</P>
<P>"Ma&s;ter L&mdash;, aged 9 years, became &s;uddenly ill in the night about a week before I &s;aw him. On the day before the attack, he had taken opening medicines, and had bathed afterwards. He had complained of violently acute pain in his head, &s;hrieked frequently, ground his teeth hard, could not bear to have his head rai&s;ed from the pillow, and was torpid or deaf. His tongue was white, pul&s;e 110 in the evening and full. As yet the pupil of the eye was irri|table, and he had no &s;trabi&s;mus. He had been bled with leeches about the head, and bli&s;tered. I directed mercurial inunction, and calomel from 3 to 6 grains to be taken at fir&s;t every &s;ix, and after|wards every three hours. This plan produced no &s;en&s;ible effect, and the patient died on the 18th day after the &s;eizure. He had con|vul&s;ion fits two days preceding his death, and the well-known &s;ymp|toms of hydrocephalus internus all made their appearance. From what I had &s;een and read of this di&s;ea&s;e, I believed it to belong to inflammations, and at an earlier period I &s;hould be tempted to bleed as largely as for pneumonia. The fluid found after death in the ventricules of the brain I impute to debility of the ab&s;orbents induced by inflammation. My rea&s;ons are briefly the&s;e; 1. The acutene&s;s of the pain. 2. The &s;tate of the pul&s;e. In the above ca&s;e for the fir&s;t 9 or 10 days it did not exceed 110, and was full and &s;trong.

3. To find out whether any febrile alternations took place, Ma&s;ter L.'s feet were frequently felt, and they were found at times cold, and at other times of a dry heat. I have many times &s;een this di&s;|ea&s;e, but the patients were too young, or too far advanced, to in|form me, whether they had chillne&s;s &s;ucceeded by heat at its on&s;et. 4. The di&s;orders to which the young are more peculiarly liable afford a pre&s;umption, that hydrocephalus internus is an inflammatory di&s;|ea&s;e; and this is confirmed by the regularity of the period, within which it fini&s;hes its cour&s;e.

<P>I have ju&s;t now been well informed, that Dr. Ru&s;h has lately cured five out of &s;ix patients by copious bleedings. I relate here the rea&s;ons for an opinion without pretending to a di&s;covery.

<P>To this idea of Dr. Beddoes may be added, that the hydrocele ge|nerally &s;ucceeds an injury, and con&s;equent inflammation of the bag, which contains it. And that other drop&s;ies, which principally attend inebriates, are con&s;equent to too great action of the mucous mem|branes by the &s;timulus of beer, wine, and &s;pirits. And la&s;tly, that as the&s;e ca&s;es of hydrocephalus end &s;o fatally, a new mode of treating them is much to be de&s;ired, and de&s;erves to be &s;eriou&s;ly attend|ed to.</P>

<HEAD>ADDITION III. ON VERTIGO.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To be placed after the additional Note at the end of Vol. <HI>I.</HI> on this Subject.</HEAD>
<P>Having reperu&s;ed the ingenious E&s;&s;ay of Dr. Wells on Single Vi|&s;ion, and his additional ob&s;ervations in the Gentleman's Magazine on the apparent retrogre&s;&s;ion of objects in vertigo, I am induced to be|lieve, that this apparent retrogre&s;&s;ion of objects is not always owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on revolves with his eyes clo&s;ed, till he becomes ver|tiginous, and then &s;tands &s;till without opening them, he &s;eems for a while to go forward in the &s;ame direction. This hallucination of his ideas cannot be owing to ocular &s;pectra, becau&s;e, as Dr. Wells ob|&s;erves, no &s;uch can have been formed; but it mu&s;t ari&s;e from a &s;imi|lar continuance or repetition of ideas belonging to the &s;en&s;e of touch, in&s;tead of to the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion; and &s;hould therefore be called a tan|gible, not a vi&s;ual, vertigo. In common language this belief of con|tinuing to revolve for &s;ome time, after he &s;tands &s;till, when a per&s;on has turned round for a minute in the dark, would be called a decep|tion of imagination.</P>
<P>Now at this time if he opens his eyes upon a gilt book, placed with other books on a &s;helf about the height of his eye, the gilt book &s;eems to recede in the contrary direction; though his eyes are at this time kept quite &s;till, as well as the gilt book. For if his eyes were not kept &s;till, other books would fall on them in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; which, when I repeatedly made the experiment, did not occur; and which thus evinces, that no motion of the eyes is the cau&s;e of the apparent retroce&s;&s;ion of the gilt book. Why then does it happen?&mdash;Certainly
<PB N="631" REF="6390">
from an hallucination of ideas, or in common language the deception of imagination.</P>
<P>The vertiginous per&s;on &s;till imagines, that he continues to revolve forwards, after he has opened his eyes; and in con&s;equence that the objects, which his eyes happen to fall upon, are revolving backward; as they would appear to do, if he was actually turning round with his eyes open. For he has been accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve the motion$ of bodies, whether apparent or real, &s;o much more frequently by the eye than by the touch; that the pre&s;ent belief of his gyration, occa|&s;ioned by the hallucinations of the &s;en&s;e of touch, is attended with ideas of &s;uch imagined motions of vi&s;ible objects, as have always ac|companied his former gyrations, and have thus been a&s;&s;ociated with the mu&s;cular actions and perceptions of touch, which occurred at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>When the remains of colours are &s;een in the eye, they are termed ocular &s;pectra; when remaining &s;ounds are heard in the ear, they may be called auricular murmurs; but when the remaining motions, or ideas, of the &s;en&s;e of touch continue, as in this vertigo of a blind|folded per&s;on, they have acquired no name, but may be termed eva|ne&s;cent titillations, or tangible hallucinations.</P>
<P>Whence I conclude, that vertigo may have for its cau&s;e either the ocular &s;pectra of the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion, when a per&s;on revolves with his eyes open; or the auricular murmurs of the &s;en&s;e of hearing, if he is revolved near a ca&s;cade; or the evane&s;cent titillations of the &s;en&s;e of touch, if he revolves blindfold. All the&s;e I &s;hould wi&s;h to call va|ni&s;hing ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions, of tho&s;e organs of &s;en&s;e; which ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions, have lately been a&s;&s;ociated in a circle, and therefore for a time continue to be excited. And what are the ideas of colours, when they are excited by imagination or memory, but the repetition of finer ocular &s;pectra? What the idea of &s;ounds, but the repetition of finer auricular murmurs? And what the ideas of tangible objects, but the repetition of finer evane&s;cent titillations?</P>
<P><PB N="632" REF="6400">
The tangible, and the auricular, and the vi&s;ual vertigo, are all perceived by many people for a day or two after long travelling in a boat or coach; the motions of the ve&s;&s;el, or vehicle, or of the &s;ur|rounding objects, and the noi&s;e of the wheels and oars, occur at in|tervals of reverie, or at the commencement of &s;leep. See Sect. XX. 5. The&s;e ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions, of &s;ight, of hearing, and of touch, are &s;ucceeded by the &s;ame effects as the ocular &s;pectra, the auricular murmurs, and the evane&s;cent titillations above mentioned; that is, by a kind of vertigo, and cannot in that re&s;pect be di&s;tingui&s;hed from them. Which is a further confirmation of the truth of the doctrine delivered in Sect. III. of this work, that the colours remaining in the eyes, which are termed ocular &s;pectra, are ideas, or &s;en&s;ual motions, belonging to the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion, which for too long a time continue their activity.</P>

<HEAD>ADDITION IV. OF VOLUNTARY MOTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>A corre&s;pondent acquaints me, that he finds difficulty in under|&s;tanding how the convul&s;ions of the limbs in epilep&s;y can be induced by voluntary exertions. This I &s;u&s;pect fir&s;t to have ari&s;en from the double meaning of the words "involuntary motions;" which are &s;ometimes u&s;ed for tho&s;e motions, which are performed without the interference of volition, as the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries; and at other times for tho&s;e actions, which occur, where two coun|ter volitions oppo&s;e each other, and the &s;tronger prevails; as in en|deavouring to &s;uppre&s;s laughter, and to &s;top the &s;hudderings, when expo&s;ed to cold. Thus when the poet writes,
<Q><L>&mdash;video meliora, proboque,</L>
<L>Deteriora &s;equor.&mdash;</L></Q>
<PB N="633" REF="6410">
The &s;tronger volition actuates the &s;y&s;tem, but not without the counteraction of unavailing &s;maller ones; which con&s;titute delibera|tion.</P>
<P>A &s;econd difficulty may have ari&s;en from the confined u&s;e of the words "to will," which in common di&s;cour&s;e generally mean to choo&s;e after deliberation; and hence our will or volition is &s;uppo&s;ed to be always in our own power. But the will or voluntary power, acts always from motive, as explained in Sect. XXXIV. 1. and in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 3. 2. and III. 2. 1. 12. which motive can frequently be examined previous to action, and balanced again&s;t oppo&s;ite motives, which is called deliberation; at other times the motive is &s;o powerful as immediately to excite the &s;en&s;orial power of volition into action, without a previous balancing of oppo&s;ite motives, or counter volitions. The former of the&s;e volitions is exerci&s;ed in the common purpo&s;es of life, and the latter in the exertions of epilep&s;y and in&s;anity.</P>
<P>It is difficult <HI>to think without words,</HI> which however all tho&s;e mu&s;t do, who di&s;cover new truths by rea&s;oning; and &s;till more difficult, when the words in common u&s;e deceive us by their twofold mean|ings, or by the inaccuracy of the ideas, which they &s;ugge&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>ADDITION V. OF FIGURE.</HEAD>
<P>I feel my&s;elf much obliged by the accurate attention given to the fir&s;t volume of Zoonomia, and by the ingenious critici&s;ms be&s;towed on it, by the learned writers of that article both in the Analytical and Engli&s;h Reviews. Some circum&s;tances, in which their &s;entiments do not accord with tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ed in the work, I intend to recon&s;ider, and to explain further at &s;ome future time. One thing, in which both the&s;e gentlemen &s;eem to di&s;&s;ent from me, I &s;hall now mention, it is concerning the manner, in which we acquire the idea of figure; a circum&s;tance of great importance in the knowledge of our intellect,
<PB N="634" REF="6420">
as it &s;hews the cau&s;e of the accuracy of our ideas of motion, time, &s;pace, number, and of the mathematical &s;ciences, which are concern|ed in the men&s;urations or proportions of figure.</P>
<P>This I imagine may have in part ari&s;en from the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which has almo&s;t univer&s;ally prevail$$, that ideas are immaterial beings, and therefore po&s;&s;e&s;s no properties in common with &s;olid mat|ter. Which I &s;uppo&s;e to be a fanciful hypothe&s;is, like the &s;tories of gho&s;ts and apparitions, which have &s;o long amu&s;ed, and &s;till amu&s;e, the credulous without any foundation in nature.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of our own bodies, and of their &s;olidity, and of their figure, and of their motions, is taken for granted in my account of ideas; becau&s;e the ideas them&s;elves are believed to con&s;i&s;t of motions or configurations of &s;olid fibres; and the que&s;tion now propo&s;ed is, how we become acquainted with the figures of bodies external to our organs of &s;en&s;e? Which I can only repeat from what is mentioned in Sect. XIV. 2. 2. that if part of an organ of &s;en&s;e be &s;timulated into action, as of the &s;en&s;e of touch, that part &s;o &s;timulated into action mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s figure, which mu&s;t be &s;imilar to the figure of the body, which &s;timulates it.</P>
<P>Another previous prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, which may have ren|dered the manner of our acquiring the knowledge of figure le&s;s intel|ligible, may have ari&s;en from the common opinion of the perceiving faculty re&s;iding in the head; whereas our daily experience &s;hews, that our perception (which con&s;i&s;ts of an idea, and of the plea&s;ure or pain it occa&s;ions) exi&s;ts principally in the organ of &s;en&s;e, which is &s;ti|mulated into action; as every one, who burns his finger in the candle, mu&s;t be bold to deny.</P>
<P>When an ivory triangle is pre&s;&s;ed on the palm of the hand, the figure of the &s;urface of the part of the organ of touch thus compre&s;&s;ed is a triangle, re&s;embling in figure the figure of the external body, which compre&s;&s;es it. The action of the &s;timulated fibres, which con|&s;titute the idea of hardne&s;s and of figure, remains in this part of the
<PB N="635" REF="6430">
&s;en&s;orium, which forms the &s;en&s;e of touch; but the &s;en&s;orial motion, which con&s;titutes plea&s;ure or pain, and which is excited in con&s;e|quence of the&s;e fibrous motions of the organ of &s;en&s;e, is propagated to the central parts of the &s;en&s;orium, or to the whole of it; though this generally occurs in le&s;s degree of energy, than it exi&s;ts in the &s;timulated organ of &s;en&s;e; as in the in&s;tance above mentioned of burn|ing a finger in the candle.</P>
<P>Some, who have e&s;pou&s;ed the doctrine of the immateriality of ideas, have &s;eriou&s;ly doubted the exi&s;tence of a material world, with which only our &s;en&s;es acquaint us; and yet have a&s;&s;ented to the exi&s;tence of &s;pirit, with which our &s;en&s;es cannot acquaint us; and have finally allowed, that all our knowledge is derived through the medium of our &s;en&s;es! They forget, that if the &s;pirit of animation had no proper|ties in common with matter, it could neither affect nor be affected by the material body. But the knowledge of our own material exi&s;tence being granted, which I &s;u&s;pect few rational per&s;ons will &s;eriou&s;ly deny, the exi&s;tence of a material external world follows in cour&s;e; as our perceptions, when we are awake and not in&s;ane, are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from tho&s;e excited by &s;en&s;ation, as in our dreams, and from tho&s;e excited by volition or by a&s;&s;ociation as in in&s;anity and reverie, by the power we have of comparing the pre&s;ent perceptions of one &s;en&s;e with tho&s;e of another, as explained in Sect. XIV. 2. 5. And al&s;o by comparing the tribes of ideas, which the &s;ymbols of pictures, or of languages, &s;ugge&s;t to us, by intuitive analogy with our previous experience, that is, with the common cour&s;e of nature.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Cold and hot Fit.</HEAD>
<P>As the torpor, with which a fit of fever commences, is &s;ometimes owing to defect of &s;timulus, as in going into the cold-bath; and &s;ometimes to a previous exhau&s;tion of the &s;en&s;orial power by the ac|tion of &s;ome violent &s;timulus, as after coming out of a hot room into cold air; a longer time mu&s;t elap&s;e, before there can be a &s;ufficient accumulation of &s;en&s;orial power to produce a hot fit in one ca&s;e than in the other. Becau&s;e in the latter ca&s;e the quantity of &s;en&s;orial power previou&s;ly expended mu&s;t be &s;upplied, before an accumulation can begin.</P>
<P>The cold paroxy&s;m commences, when the torpor of a part becomes &s;o great, and its motions in con&s;equence &s;o &s;low or feeble, as not to excite the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; which in health contributes to move the re&s;t of the &s;y&s;tem, which is catenated with it. And the hot fit commences by the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irri|tation of the part fir&s;t affected, either &s;o as to counteract its deficient &s;timulus, or its previous wa&s;te of &s;en&s;orial power; and it becomes general by the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; which is excited by the renovated actions of the part fir&s;t affected; or becomes &s;o great as to overbalance the deficient excitement of it. On all the&s;e accounts the hot fit cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to bear any propor|tion to the cold one in length of time, though the latter may be the con&s;equence of the former. See Suppl.

<P>WHEN the heat of the body in weak patients in fevers is increa&s;ed by the &s;timulus of the points of flannel, a greater con&s;equent debility &s;ucceeds, than when it is produced by the warmth of fire; as in the former the heat is in part owing to the increa&s;ed activity of the &s;kin, and con&s;equent expenditure of &s;en&s;orial power; whereas in the latter ca&s;e it is in part owing to the influx of the fluid matter of heat.</P>
<P>So the warmth produced by equitation, or by rubbing the body and limbs with a &s;mooth bru&s;h or hand, as is done after bathing in &s;ome parts of the Ea&s;t, does not expend nearly &s;o much &s;en&s;orial power, as when the warmth is produced by the locomotion of the whole weight of the body by mu&s;cular action, as in walking, or running, or &s;wim|ming.

<HEAD>ADDITION VIII. PUERPERAL FEVER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To be added to Cla&s;s <HI>II. 1. 6. 16.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A very intere&s;ting account of the puerperal fever, which was epi|demic at Aberdeen, has been lately publi&s;hed by Dr. Alexander Gor|don. (Robin&s;on, London.) In &s;everal di&s;&s;ections of tho&s;e, who died of this di&s;ea&s;e, purulent matter was found in the cavity of the abdo|men; which he a&s;cribes to an ery&s;ipelatous inflammation of the pe|ritonaeum, as its principal &s;eat, and of its productions, as the omen|tum, me&s;entery, and peritonaeal coat of the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>He believes, that it was infectious, and that the contagion was al|ways carried by the accoucheur or the nur&s;e from one lying-in woman to another.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e began with violent unremitting pain of the abdomen on the day of delivery, or the next day, with &s;huddering, and very quick pul&s;e, often 140 in a minute. In this &s;ituation, if he &s;aw the patient within 12 or 24 hours of her &s;eizure, he took away from 16 to 24 ounces of blood, which was always &s;izy. He then immedi|ately gave a cathartic con&s;i&s;ting of three grains of calomel, and 40 grains of powder of jalap. After this had operated, he gave an opiate at night; and continued the purging and the opiate for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;erts, that almo&s;t all tho&s;e, whom he was permitted to treat in this manner early in the di&s;ea&s;e, recovered to the number of 50; and that almo&s;t all the re&s;t died. But that when two or three days were elap&s;ed, the patient became too weak for this method; and the matter was already formed, which de&s;troyed them. Except that he &s;aw two patients, who recovered after di&s;charging a large quantity of matter at the navel. And a few, who were relieved by the appearance of external ery&s;ipelas on the extremities.</P>
<P><PB N="639" REF="6470">
This di&s;ea&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of an ery&s;ipelatous inflammation, may oc|ca&s;ion the great debility &s;ooner to occur than in inflammation of the uterus; which latter is neither ery&s;ipelatous, I &s;uppo&s;e, nor contagi|ous. And the &s;ucce&s;s of Dr. Gordon's practice &s;eems to corre&s;pond with that of Dr. Ru&s;h in the contagious fever or plague at Philadel|phia; which appeared to be much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by early evacuations. One ca&s;e I &s;aw &s;ome time ago, where violent uncea&s;ing pain of the whole abdomen occurred a few hours after delivery, with quick pul&s;e; which cea&s;ed after the patient had twice lo&s;t about eight ounces of blood, and had taken a moderate cathartic with calomel.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e induces me to think, that it might be &s;afer and equally efficacious, to take le&s;s blood at fir&s;t, than Dr. Gordon mentions, and to repeat the operation in a few hours, if the continuance of the &s;ymp|toms &s;hould require it. And the &s;ame in re&s;pect to the cathartic, which might perhaps be given in le&s;s quantity, and repeated every two or three hours.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould I wi&s;h to give an opiate after the fir&s;t vene&s;ection and cathartic; as I &s;u&s;pect that this might be injurious, except tho&s;e evacuations had emptied the ve&s;&s;els &s;o much, that the &s;timulus of the opiate &s;hould act only by increa&s;ing the ab&s;orption of the new ve&s;&s;els or fluids produced on the &s;urfaces of the inflamed membranes. In other inflammations of the bowels, and in acute rheumati&s;m, I have &s;een the di&s;ea&s;e much prolonged, and I believe &s;ometimes ren|dered fatal, by the too early admini&s;tration of opiates, either along with cathartics, or at their intervals; while a &s;mall do&s;e of opium given after &s;ufficient evacuations produces ab&s;orption only by its &s;ti|mulus, and much contributes to the cure of the patient. We may have vi&s;ible te&s;timony of this effect of opium, when a &s;olution of it is put into an inflamed eye; if it be thus u&s;ed previous to &s;ufficient eva|cuation, it increa&s;es the inflammation; if it be u&s;ed after &s;ufficient evacuation, it increa&s;es ab&s;orption only, and clears the eye in a very &s;mall time.</P>

I cannot omit ob&s;erving, from con&s;idering the&s;e circum&s;tances, how unwi&s;e is the common practice of giving an opiate to every woman immediately after her delivery, which mu&s;t often have been of dan|gerous con&s;equence.</P>

<P N="1">I. 1. THOSE THINGS, which pre&s;erve in their natural &s;tate the due exertions of all the irritative motions, are termed nutrientia; they produce the growth, and re&s;tore the wa&s;te, of the &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t of a variety of mild vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances, water, and air.</P>
<P N="2">2. Where &s;tronger &s;timuli have been long u&s;ed, they become ne|ne&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, as mu&s;tard, &s;pice, &s;alt, beer, wine, vinegar, alcohol, opium. Which however, as they are unnatural &s;timuli, and difficult to manage in re&s;pect to quantity, are liable to &s;horten the &s;pan of human life, &s;ooner rendering the &s;y&s;tem incapable of being &s;timulated into action by the nutrientia. See Sect. XXXVII. 4. On the &s;ame account life is &s;horter in warmer climates than in more tem|perate ones.</P>

<PB N="660" REF="6660">
<HEAD>II. OBSERVATIONS ON THE NUTRIENTIA.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. 1. The fle&s;h of animals contains more nouri&s;hment, and &s;timu|lates our ab&s;orbent and &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els more powerfully, than the vegetable productions, which we u&s;e as food; for the carnivorous animals can fa&s;t longer without injury than the graminivorous; and we feel our&s;elves warmer and &s;tronger after a meal of fle&s;h than of grain. Hence in di&s;ea&s;es attended with cold extremities and general debility this kind of diet is preferred; as in rickets, drop&s;y, &s;crophula, and in hy&s;teric and hypochondriac ca&s;es, and to prevent the returns of agues. Might not fle&s;h in &s;mall quantities brui&s;ed to a pulp be more advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed in fevers attended with debility than vegetable diet?</P>
<P>That fle&s;h, which is of the darke&s;t colour, generally contains more nouri&s;hment, and &s;timulates our ve&s;&s;els more powerfully, than the white kinds. The fle&s;h of the carnivorous and pi&s;civorous animals is &s;o &s;timulating, that it &s;eldom enters into the food of European na|tions, except the &s;wine, the Soland goo&s;e (Pelicanus Ba&s;&s;anus), and formerly the &s;wan. Of the&s;e the &s;wine and the &s;wan are fed previ|ou&s;ly upon vegetable aliment; and the Soland goo&s;e is taken in very &s;mall quantity, only as a whet to the appetite. Next to the&s;e are the birds, that feed upon in&s;ects, which are perhaps the mo&s;t &s;timulating and the mo&s;t nutritive of our u&s;ual food.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that a greater quantity of volatile alkali can be obtained from this kind of fle&s;h, to which has been a&s;cribed its &s;timulating quality. But it is more probable, that fre&s;h fle&s;h contains only the elements of volatile alkali.</P>
<P N="2">2. Next to the dark coloured fle&s;h of animals, the various tribes of &s;hell-fi&s;h &s;eem to claim their place, and the whole&s;ome kinds of
<PB N="661" REF="6670">
mu&s;hrooms, which mu&s;t be e&s;teemed animal food, both for their al|kale&s;cent tendency, their &s;timulating quality, and the quantity of nouri&s;hment, which they afford; as oy&s;ters, lob&s;ters, crabfi&s;h, &s;hrimps; mu&s;hrooms; to which perhaps might be added &s;ome of the fi&s;h without &s;cales; as the eel, barbolt, tench, &s;melt, turbot, turtle.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of many kinds of fi&s;h, when it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have un|dergone a beginning putrefaction, becomes luminous in the dark. This &s;eems to &s;hew a tendency in the pho&s;phorus to e&s;cape, and com|bine with the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere; and would hence &s;hew, that this kind of fle&s;h is not &s;o perfectly animalized as tho&s;e before mentioned. This light, as it is frequently &s;een on rotten wood, and &s;ometimes on veal, which has been kept too long, as I have been told, is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to have its cau&s;e from putrefaction; but is neverthele&s;s mo&s;t probably of pho&s;phoric origin, like that &s;een in the dark on oy&s;ter-&s;hells, which have previou&s;ly been ignited, and afterwards expo&s;ed to the &s;un&s;hine, and on the Bolognian &s;tone. See Botan. Gard. Vol. I. Cant. I. line 1 and 2, the note.</P>
<P N="3">3. The fle&s;h of young animals, as of lamb, veal, and &s;ucking pigs, &s;upplies us with a &s;till le&s;s &s;timulating food. The broth of the&s;e is &s;aid to become &s;our, and continues &s;o a con&s;iderable time be|fore it changes into putridity; &s;o much does their fle&s;h partake of the chemical properties of the milk, with which the&s;e animals are nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P N="4">4. The white meats, as of turkey, partridge, phea&s;ant, fowl, with their eggs, &s;eem to be the next in mildne&s;s; and hence are ge|nerally fir&s;t allowed to convale&s;cents from inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">5. Next to tho&s;e &s;hould be ranked the white river-fi&s;h, which have &s;cales, as pike, perch, gudgeon.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="662" REF="6680">
II. 1. Milk unites the animal with the vegetable &s;ource of our nouri&s;hment, partaking of the properties of both. As it contains &s;ugar, and will therefore ferment and produce a kind of wine or &s;pi|rit, which is a common liquor in Siberia; or will run into an acid by &s;imple agitation, as in the churning of cream; and la&s;tly, as it con|tains coagulable lymph, which will undergo the proce&s;s of putrefac|tion like other animal &s;ub&s;tances, as in old chee&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Milk may be &s;eparated by re&s;t or by agitation into cream, butter, butter-milk, whey, curd. The cream is ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion to adults, becau&s;e it contains le&s;s of the coagulum or chee&s;y part, and is al&s;o more nutritive. Butter con&s;i&s;ting of oil between an animal and vege|table kind contains &s;till more nutriment, and in its recent &s;tate is not difficult of dige&s;tion if taken in moderate quantity. See Art. I. 2. 3. 2. Butter-milk if it be not bitter is an agreeable and nutritive fluid, if it be bitter it has &s;ome putrid parts of the cream in it, which had been kept too long; but is perhaps not le&s;s whole&s;ome for being &s;our to a certain degree: as the inferior people in Scotland choo&s;e &s;our milk in preference to &s;kimmed milk before it is become &s;our. Whey is the lea&s;t nutritive and ea&s;ie&s;t of dige&s;tion. And in the &s;pring of the year, when the cows feed on young gra&s;s, it contains &s;o much of vegetable properties, as to become a &s;alutary potation, when drank to about a pint every morning to tho&s;e, who during the winter have taken too little vegetable nouri&s;hment, and who are thence liable to bilious con|cretions.</P>
<P N="3">3. Chee&s;e is of various kinds, according to the greater or le&s;s quan|tity of cream, which it contains, and according to its age. Tho&s;e chee&s;es, which are ea&s;ie&s;t broken to pieces in the mouth, are gene|rally ea&s;ie&s;t of dige&s;tion, and contain mo&s;t nutriment. Some kinds of chee&s;e, though &s;low of dige&s;tion, are al&s;o &s;low in changing by chemical
<PB N="663" REF="6690">
proce&s;&s;es in the &s;tomach, and therefore will frequently agree well with tho&s;e, who have a weak dige&s;tion; as I have &s;een toa&s;ted chee&s;e vomited up a whole day after it was eaten without having un|dergone any apparent change, or given any unea&s;ine&s;s to the patient. It is probable a portion of &s;ugar, or of animal fat, or of the gravy of boiled or roa&s;ted meat, mixed with chee&s;e at the time of making it, might add to its plea&s;ant and nutritious quality.</P>
<P N="4">4. The rea&s;on, why autumnal milk is &s;o much thicker or coagu|lable than vernal milk, is not ea&s;y to under&s;tand, but as new milk is in many re&s;pects &s;imilar to chyle, it may be con&s;idered as food already in part dige&s;ted by the animal it is taken from, and thence &s;upplies a nutriment of ea&s;y dige&s;tion. But as it requires to be curdled by the ga&s;tric acid, before it can enter the lacteals, as is &s;een in the &s;tomachs of calves, it &s;eems more &s;uitable to children, who&s;e &s;tomachs abound more with acidity, than to adults; but neverthele&s;s &s;upplies good nouri&s;hment to many of the latter, and particularly to tho&s;e, who u&s;e vegetable food, and who&s;e &s;tomachs have not been much accu&s;|tomed to the unnatural &s;timulus of &s;pice, &s;alt, and &s;pirit. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 5.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. The &s;eeds, roots, leaves, and fruits of plants, con&s;titute the greate&s;t part of the food of mankind; the re&s;pective quantities of nouri&s;hment, which the&s;e contain, may perhaps be e&s;timated from the quantity of &s;tarch, or of &s;ugar, they can be made to produce: in farinaceous &s;eeds, the mucilage &s;eems gradually to be converted into &s;tarch, while they remain in our granaries; and the &s;tarch by the germination of the young plant, as in making malt from barley, or by animal dige&s;tion, is converted into &s;ugar. Hence old wheat and beans contain more &s;tarch than new; and in our &s;tomachs other vegetable
<PB N="664" REF="6700">
and animal materials are converted into &s;ugar; which con&s;ti|tutes in all creatures a part of their chyle.</P>
<P>Hence it is probable, that &s;ugar is the mo&s;t nutritive part of vege|tables; and that they are more nutritive, as they are convertible in greater quantity into &s;ugar by the power of dige&s;tion; as appears from &s;ugar being found in the chyle of all animals, and from its exi&s;ting in great quantity in the urine of patients in the diabaetes, of which a curious ca&s;e is related in Sect. XXIX. 4. where a man labouring un|der this malady eat and drank an enormous quantity, and &s;ometimes voided &s;ixteen pints of water in a day, with an ounce of &s;ugar in each pint.</P>
<P N="2">2. Oil, when mixed with mucilage or coagulable lymph, as in cream or new milk, is ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and con&s;titutes probably the mo&s;t nutritive part of animal diet; as oil is another part of the chyle of all animals. As the&s;e two materials, &s;ugar and butter, contain much nutriment under a &s;mall volume, and readily undergo &s;ome che|mical change &s;o as to become acid or rancid; they are liable to di&s;turb weak &s;tomachs, when taken in large quantity, more than aliment, which contains le&s;s nouri&s;hment, and is at the &s;ame time le&s;s liable to chemical changes; becau&s;e the chyle is produced quicker than the torpid lacteals can ab&s;orb it, and thence undergoes a further chemical proce&s;s. Sugar and butter therefore are not &s;o ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, when taken in large quantity, as tho&s;e things, which contain le&s;s nutriment; hence, where the &s;tomach is weak, they mu&s;t be u&s;ed in le&s;s quan|tity. But the cu&s;tom of &s;ome people in re&s;training children entirely from them, is depriving them of a very whole&s;ome, agreeable, and &s;ub&s;tantial part of their diet. Honey, manna, &s;ap-juice, are different kinds of le&s;s pure &s;ugar.</P>
<P N="3">3. All the e&s;culent vegetables contain a bland oil, or mucilage, or
<PB N="665" REF="6710">
&s;tarch, or &s;ugar, or acid; and, as their &s;timulus is moderate, are pro|perly given alone as food in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es; and mixed with milk con&s;titute the food of thou&s;ands. Other vegetables po&s;&s;e&s;s vari|ous degrees and various kinds of &s;timulus; and to the&s;e we are be|holden for the greater part of our Materia Medica, which produce nau&s;ea, &s;ickne&s;s, vomiting, cathar&s;is, intoxication, inflammation, and even death, if un&s;kilfully admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>The acrid or intoxicating, and other kinds of vegetable juices, &s;uch as produce &s;ickne&s;s, or evacuate the bowels, or &s;uch even as are only di&s;agreeable to the palate, appear to be a part of the defence of tho&s;e vegetables, which po&s;&s;e&s;s them, from the a&s;&s;aults of larger animals or of in&s;ects. As mentioned in the Botanic Garden, Part II. Cant. I. line 161, note. This appears in a forcible manner from the peru&s;al of &s;ome travels, which have been publi&s;hed of tho&s;e unfortunate people, who have &s;uffered &s;hipwreck on uncultivated countries, and have with difficulty found food to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, in otherwi&s;e not inho&s;pitable climates.</P>
<P N="4">4. As the&s;e acrid and intoxicating juices generally re&s;ide in the mucilage, and not in the &s;tarch of many roots, and &s;eeds, according to the ob&s;ervation of M. Parmentier, the whole&s;ome or nutritive parts of &s;ome vegetables may be thus &s;eparated from the medicinal parts of them. Thus if the root of white briony be ra&s;ped into cold water, by means of a bread-grater made of a tinned iron plate, and agitated in it, the acrid juice of the root along with the mucilage will be di&s;|&s;olved, or &s;wim, in the water; while a &s;tarch perfectly whole&s;ome and nutritious will &s;ub&s;ide, and may be u&s;ed as food in times of &s;carcity.</P>
<P>M. Parmentier further ob&s;erves, that potatoes contain too much mucilage in proportion to their &s;tarch, which prevents them from being converted into good bread. But that if the &s;tarch be collected from
<PB N="666" REF="6720">
ten pounds of raw potatoes by grating them into cold water, and agi|tating them, as above mentioned; and if the &s;tarch thus procured be mixed with other ten pounds of boiled potatoes, and properly &s;ub|jected to fermentation like wheat flour, that it will make as good bread as the fine&s;t wheat.</P>
<P>Good bread may al&s;o be made by mixing wheat-flour with boiled potatoes. Eighteen pounds of wheat flour are &s;aid to make twenty|two pounds and a half of bread. Eighteen pounds of wheat-flour mixed with nine pounds of boiled potatoes, are &s;aid to make twenty|nine pounds and a half of bread. This difference of weight mu&s;t ari&s;e from the difference of the previous dryne&s;s of the two materials. The potatoes might probably make better flour, if they were boiled in &s;team, in a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el, made &s;ome degrees hotter than common boiling water.</P>
<P>Other vegetable matters may be deprived of their too great acri|mony by boiling in water, as the great variety of the cabbage, the young tops of white briony, water-cre&s;&s;es, a&s;paragus, with innu|merable roots, and &s;ome fruits. Other plants have their acrid juices or bitter particles dimini&s;hed by covering them from the light by what is termed blanching them, as the &s;tems and leaves of cellery, endive, &s;ea-kale. The former method either extracts or decompo&s;es the acrid particles, and the latter prevents them from being formed. See Botanic Garden, Vol. I. additional note XXXIV. on the Etiolation of vegetables.</P>
<P N="5">5. The art of cookery, by expo&s;ing vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances to heat, has contributed to increa&s;e the quantity of the food of man|kind by other means be&s;ides that of de&s;troying their acrimony. One of the&s;e is by converting the acerb juices of &s;ome fruits into &s;ugar, as in the baking of unripe pears, and the brui&s;ing of unripe apples; in both which &s;ituations the life of the vegetable is de&s;troyed, and the
<PB N="667" REF="6730">
conver&s;ion of the har&s;h juice into a &s;weet one mu&s;t be performed by a chemical proce&s;s; and not by a vegetable one only, as the germina|tion of barley in making malt has generally been &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some circum&s;tances, which &s;eem to injure the life of &s;everal fruits, &s;eem to forward the &s;accharine proce&s;s of their juices. Thus if &s;ome kinds of pears are gathered a week before they would ripen on the tree, and are laid on a heap and covered, their juice becomes &s;weet many days &s;ooner. The taking off a circular piece of the bark from a branch of a pear-tree cau&s;es the fruit of that branch to ripen &s;ooner by a fortnight, as I have more than once ob&s;erved. The wounds made in apples by in&s;ects occa&s;ion tho&s;e apples to ripen &s;ooner; capri|fication, or the piercing of figs, in the i&s;land of Malta, is &s;aid to ripen them &s;ooner; and I am well informed, that when bunches of grapes in this country have acquired their expected &s;ize, that if the &s;talk of each bunch be cut half through, that they will &s;ooner ripen.</P>
<P>The germinating barley in the malt-hou&s;e I believe acquires little &s;weetne&s;s, till the life of the &s;eed is de&s;troyed, and the &s;accharine pro|ce&s;s then continued or advanced by the heat in drying it. Thus in animal dige&s;tion, the &s;ugar produced in the &s;tomach is ab&s;orbed by the lacteals as fa&s;t as it is made, otherwi&s;e it ferments, and produces flatulency; &s;o in the germination of barley in the malt-hou&s;e, &s;o long as the new plant lives, the &s;ugar, I &s;uppo&s;e, is ab&s;orbed as fa&s;t as it is made; but that, which we u&s;e in making beer, is the &s;ugar pro|duced by a chemical proce&s;s after the death of the young plant, or which is made more expeditiou&s;ly, than the plant can ab&s;orb it.</P>
<P>It is probably this &s;accharine proce&s;s, which obtains in new hay|&s;tacks too ha&s;tily, and which by immediately running into fermenta|tion produces &s;o much heat as to &s;et them on fire. The greate&s;t part of the grain, or &s;eeds, or roots, u&s;ed in the di&s;tilleries, as wheat, ca|nary &s;eed, potatoes, are not I believe previou&s;ly &s;ubjected to ger|mination, but are in part by a chemical proce&s;s converted into &s;ugar, and immediately &s;ubjected to vinous fermentation; and it is probable a proce&s;s may &s;ometime be di&s;covered of producing &s;ugar
<PB N="668" REF="6740">
from &s;tarch or meal; and of &s;eparating it from them for dome&s;tic pur|po&s;es by alcohol, which di&s;&s;olves &s;ugar but not mucilage; or by other means.</P>
<P>Another method of increa&s;ing the nutriment of mankind by cook|ery, is by di&s;&s;olving cartilages and bones, and tendons, and probably &s;ome vegetables, in &s;team or water at a much higher degree of heat than that of boiling. This is to be done in a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el, which is called Papin's dige&s;ter; in which, it is &s;aid, that water may be made red-hot, and will then di&s;&s;olve all animal &s;ub&s;tances; and might thus add to our quantity of food in times of &s;carcity. This ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be made of iron, and &s;hould have an oval opening at top, with an oval lid of iron larger than the aperture; this lid &s;hould be &s;lipped in end|ways, when the ve&s;&s;el is filled, and then turned, and rai&s;ed by a &s;crew above it into contact with the under edges of the aperture. There &s;hould al&s;o be a &s;mall tube or hole covered with a weighted valve to prevent the danger of bur&s;ting the dige&s;ter.</P>
<P>Where the powers of dige&s;tion are weakened, broths made by boil|ing animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances in water afford a nutriment; though I &s;uppo&s;e not &s;o great as the fle&s;h and vegetables would afford, if taken in their &s;olid form, and mixed with &s;aliva in the act of ma&s;|tication. The aliment thus prepared &s;hould be boiled but a &s;hort time, nor &s;hould be &s;uffered to continue in our common kitchen-uten|&s;ils afterwards, as they are lined with a mixture of half lead and half tin, and are therefore unwhole&s;ome, though the copper is completely covered. And tho&s;e &s;oups, which have any acid or wine boiled in them, unle&s;s they be made in &s;ilver, or in china, or in tho&s;e pot-ve&s;|&s;els, which are not glazed by the addition of lead, are truly poi&s;onous; as the acid, as lemon-juice or vinegar, when made hot, erodes or di&s;&s;olves the lead and tin lining of the copper-ve&s;&s;els, and the leaden glaze of the porcelain ones. Hence, where &s;ilver cannot be had, iron ve&s;&s;els are preferable to tinned copper ones; or tho&s;e made of tinned iron-plates in the common tin-&s;hops, which are &s;aid to be covered with pure or block tin.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="669" REF="6750">
6. Another circum&s;tance, which facilitates the nouri&s;hment of mankind, is the mechanic art of grinding farinaceous &s;eeds into powder between mill-&s;tones; which may be called the artificial teeth of &s;o|ciety. It is probable, that &s;ome &s;oft kinds of wood, e&s;pecially when they have undergone a kind of fermentation, and become of loo&s;er texture, might be thus u&s;ed as food in times of famine.</P>
<P>Nor is it improbable, that hay, which has been kept in &s;tacks, &s;o as to undergo the &s;accharine proce&s;s, may be &s;o managed by grinding and by fermentation with yea&s;t like bread, as to &s;erve in part for the &s;u&s;tenance of mankind in times of great &s;carcity. Dr. Prie&s;tley gave to a cow for &s;ome time a &s;trong infu&s;ion of hay in large quantity for her drink, and found that &s;he produced during this treatment above double the quantity of milk. Hence if bread cannot be made from ground hay, there is great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that a nutritive beverage may be thus prepared either in its &s;accharine &s;tate, or fermented into a kind of beer.</P>
<P>In times of great &s;carcity there are other vegetables, which though not in common u&s;e, would mo&s;t probably afford whole&s;ome nouri&s;h|ment, either by boiling them, or drying and grinding them, or by both tho&s;e proce&s;&s;es in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Of the&s;e are perhaps the tops and the bark of all tho&s;e vegetables, which are armed with thorns or prickles, as goo&s;eberry trees, holly, gor&s;e, and perhaps hawthorn. The inner bark of the elm tree makes a kind of gruel. And the roots of fern, and probably of very many other roots, as of gra&s;s and of clover taken up in winter, might yield nouri&s;hment either by boiling or baking, and &s;eparating the fibres from the pulp by beating them; or by getting only the &s;tarch from tho&s;e, which po&s;&s;e&s;s an acrid mu|cilage, as the white briony.</P>
<P N="7">7. However the arts of cookery and of grinding may increa&s;e or facilitate the nouri&s;hment of mankind, the great &s;ource of it is from agriculture. In the &s;avage &s;tate, where men live &s;olely by hunting,
<PB N="670" REF="6760">
I was informed by Dr. Franklin, that there was &s;eldom more than one family exi&s;ted in a circle of five miles diameter; which in a &s;tate of pa&s;turage would &s;upport &s;ome hundred people, and in a &s;tate of agriculture many thou&s;ands. The art of feeding mankind on &s;o &s;mall a grain as wheat, which &s;eems to have been di&s;covered in Egypt by the immortal name of Ceres, &s;hewed greater ingenuity than feeding them with the large roots of potatoes, which &s;eem to have been a di&s;|covery of ill-fated Mexico.</P>
<P>This greater production of food by agriculture than by pa&s;turage, &s;hews that a nation nouri&s;hed by animal food will be le&s;s numerous than if nouri&s;hed by vegetable; and the former will therefore be li|able, if they are engaged in war, to be conquered by the latter, as Abel was &s;lain by Cain. This is perhaps the only valid argument again&s;t inclo&s;ing open arable fields. The great production of human nouri&s;hment by agriculture and pa&s;turage evinces the advantage of &s;ociety over the &s;avage &s;tate; as the number of mankind becomes in|crea&s;ed a thou&s;and fold by the arts of agriculture and pa&s;turage; and their happine&s;s is probably under good governments improved in as great a proportion, as they become liberated from the hourly fear of bea&s;ts of prey, from the daily fear of famine, and of the occa&s;ional in|cur&s;ions of their cannibal neighbours.</P>
<P>But pa&s;turage cannot exi&s;t without property both in the &s;oil, and the herds which it nurtures; and for the invention of arts, and pro|duction of tools nece&s;&s;ary to agriculture, &s;ome mu&s;t think, and others labour; and as the efforts of &s;ome will be crowned with greater &s;uc|ce&s;s than that of others, an inequality of the ranks of &s;ociety mu&s;t &s;ucceed; but this inequality of mankind in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world is too great for the purpo&s;es of producing the greate&s;t quantity of human nouri&s;hment, and the greate&s;t &s;um of human happine&s;s; there &s;hould be no &s;lavery at one end of the chain of &s;ociety, and no de&s;poti&s;m at the other.&mdash;By the future improvements of human rea|&s;on &s;uch governments may po&s;&s;ibly hereafter be e&s;tabli&s;hed, as may a
<PB N="671" REF="6770">
hundred-fold increa&s;e the numbers of mankind, and a thou&s;and-fold their happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. Water mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a part of our nutriment, be|cau&s;e &s;o much of it enters the compo&s;ition of our &s;olids as well as of our fluids; and becau&s;e vegetables are now believed to draw almo&s;t the whole of their nouri&s;hment from this &s;ource. As in them the water is decompo&s;ed, as it is per&s;pired by them in the &s;un&s;hine, the oxygen gas increa&s;es the quantity and the purity of the atmo&s;phere in their vi|cinity, and the hydrogen &s;eems to be retained, and to form the nu|tritive juices, and con&s;equent &s;ecretions of ro&s;in, gum, wax, honey, oil, and other vegetable productions. See Botanic Garden, Part I. Cant. IV. line 25, note. It has however other u&s;es in the &s;y&s;tem, be&s;ides that of a nouri&s;hing material, as it dilutes our fluids, and lu|bricates our &s;olids; and on all the&s;e accounts a daily &s;upply of it is required.</P>
<P N="2">2. River-water is in general purer than &s;pring-water; as the neutral &s;alts wa&s;hed down from the earth decompo&s;e each other, except per|haps the marine &s;alt; and the earths, with which &s;pring-water fre|quently abounds, is precipitated; yet it is not improbable, that the calcareous earth di&s;&s;olved in the water of many &s;prings may contribute to our nouri&s;hment, as the water from &s;prings, which contain earth, is &s;aid to conduce to enrich tho&s;e lands, which are flooded with it, more than river water.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many arguments &s;eem to &s;hew, that calcareous earth contributes to the nouri&s;hment of animals and vegetables. Fir&s;t becau&s;e calcare|ous earth con&s;titutes a con&s;iderable part of them, and mu&s;t therefore either be received from without, or formed by them, or both, as milk, when taken as food by a lacte&s;cent woman, is decompo&s;ed in the &s;tomach by the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion, and again in part converted
<PB N="672" REF="6780">
into milk by the pectoral glands. Secondly, becau&s;e from the ana|logy of all organic life, whatever has compo&s;ed a part of a vegetable or animal may again after its chemical &s;olution become a part of an|other vegetable or animal, &s;uch is the general tran&s;migration of mat|ter. And thirdly, becau&s;e the great u&s;e of lime in agriculture on al|mo&s;t all kinds of &s;oil and &s;ituation cannot be &s;atisfactorily explained from its chemical properties alone. Though the&s;e may al&s;o in certain &s;oils and &s;ituations have con&s;iderable effect.</P>
<P>The chemical u&s;es of lime in agriculture may be, 1. from its de|&s;troying in a &s;hort time the cohe&s;ion of dead vegetable fibres, and thus reducing them to earth, which otherwi&s;e is effected by a &s;low proce&s;s either by the con&s;umption of in&s;ects or by a gradual putrefaction. Thus I am informed that a mixture of lime with oak bark, after the tanner has extracted from it whatever is &s;oluble in water, will in two or three months reduce it to a fine black earth, which, if only laid in heaps, would require as many years to effect by its own &s;pontane|ous fermentation or putrefaction. This effect of lime mu&s;t be particu|larly advantageous to newly inclo&s;ed commons when fir&s;t broken up.</P>
<P>Secondly, lime for many months continues to attract moi&s;ture from the air or earth, which it deprives I &s;uppo&s;e of carbonic acid, and then &s;uffers it to exhale again, as is &s;een on the pla&s;tered walls of new hou&s;es. On this account it mu&s;t be advantageous when mixed with dry or &s;andy &s;oils, as it attracts moi&s;ture from the air above or the earth beneath, and this moi&s;ture is then ab&s;orbed by the lymphatics of the roots of vegetables. Thirdly, by mixing lime with clays it is believed to make them le&s;s cohe&s;ive, and thus to admit of their being more ea&s;ily penetrated by vegetable fibres. A mixture of lime with clays de&s;troys their &s;uperabundancy of acid, if &s;uch exi&s;ts, and by uniting with it converts it into gyp&s;um or alaba&s;ter. And la&s;tly, fre&s;h lime de&s;troys worms, &s;nails, and other in&s;ects, with which it happens to come in contact.</P>
<P>Yet do not all the&s;e chemical properties &s;eem to account for the
<PB N="673" REF="6790">
great u&s;es of lime in almo&s;t all &s;oils and &s;ituations, as it contributes &s;o much to the melioration of the crops, as well as to their increa&s;e in quantity. Wheat from land well limed is believed by farmers, mil|lers, and bakers, to be, as they &s;uppo&s;e, thinner &s;kinned; that is, it turns out more and better flour; which I &s;uppo&s;e is owing to its con|taining more &s;tarch and le&s;s mucilage. In re&s;pect to gra&s;s-ground I am informed, that if a &s;padeful of lime be thrown on a tu&s;&s;ock, which hor&s;es or cattle have refu&s;ed to touch for years, they will for many &s;ucceeding &s;ea&s;ons eat it quite clo&s;e to the ground.</P>
<P>One property of lime is not perhaps yet well under&s;tood, I mean its producing &s;o much heat, when it is mixed with water; which may be owing to the elementary fluid of heat con&s;olidated in the lime. It is the &s;team occa&s;ioned by this heat, when water is &s;prinkled upon lime, if the water be not in too great quantity or too cold, which breaks the lime into &s;uch fine powder as almo&s;t to become fluid, which cannot be effected perhaps by any other means, and which I &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t give great preference to lime in agriculture, and to the &s;olutions of calcareous earth in water, over chalk or powdered lime|&s;tone, when &s;pread upon the land.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was formerly believed that waters replete with calcareous earth, &s;uch as incru&s;t the in&s;ide of tea-kettles, or are &s;aid to petrify mo&s;s, were liable to produce or to increa&s;e the &s;tone in the bladder. This mi&s;taken idea has lately been exploded by the improved che|mi&s;try, as no calcareous earth, or a very minute quantity, was found in the calculi analy&s;ed by Scheel and Bergman. The waters of Mat|lock and of Carl&s;bad, both which cover the mo&s;s, which they pa&s;s through, with a calcareous cru&s;t, are &s;o far from increa&s;ing the &s;tone of the bladder or kidnies, that tho&s;e of Carl&s;bad are celebrated for giving relief to tho&s;e labouring under the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. Philo&s;. Tran&s;. Tho&s;e of Matlock are drank in great quantities without any &s;u&s;picion of injury; and I well know a per&s;on who for above ten years has
<PB N="674" REF="6800">
drank about two pints a day of cold water from a &s;pring, which very much incru&s;ts the ve&s;&s;els, it is boiled in, with calcareous earth, and affords a copious calcareous &s;ediment with a &s;olution of &s;alt of tartar, and who enjoys a &s;tate of uninterrupted health.</P>
<P N="5">V. 1. As animal bodies con&s;i&s;t much both of oxygen and azote, which make up the compo&s;ition of atmo&s;pheric air, the&s;e &s;hould be counted among&s;t nutritious &s;ub&s;tances. Be&s;ides that by the experi|ments of Dr. Prie&s;tley it appears, that the oxygen gains admittance into the blood through the moi&s;t membranes of the lungs; and &s;eems to be of much more immediate con&s;equence to the pre&s;ervation of our lives than the other kinds of nutriment above &s;pecified.</P>
<P>As the ba&s;is of fixed air, or carbonic acid gas, is carbone, which al&s;o con&s;titutes a great part both of vegetable and animal bodies; this air &s;hould likewi&s;e be reckoned among&s;t nutritive &s;ub&s;tances. Add to this, that when this carbonic acid air is &s;wallowed, as it e&s;capes from beer or cyder, or when water is charged with it as detruded from lime&s;tone by vitriolic acid, it affords an agreeable &s;en&s;ation both to the palate and &s;to$$$h, and is therefore probably nutritive.</P>
<P>The immen&s;e quantity of carbone and of oxygen which con&s;titute &s;o great a part of the lime&s;tone countries is almo&s;t beyond conception, and, as it has been formed by animals, may again become a part of them, as well as the calcareous matter with which they are united. Whence it may be conceived, that the waters, which abound with lime&s;tone in &s;olution, may &s;upply nutriment both to animals and to vegetables, as mentioned above.</P>
<P N="6">VI. 1. The manner, in which nutritious particles are &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of tho&s;e, which are mechanically abraded, or chemi|cally decompo&s;ed, or which vani&s;h by animal ab&s;orption, mu&s;t be owing to animal appetency, as de&s;cribed in Sect. XXXVII. 3. and is probably &s;imilar to the proce&s;s of inflammation, which produces new
<PB N="675" REF="6810">
ve&s;&s;els and new fluids; or to that which con&s;titutes the growth of the body to maturity. Thus the granulations of new fle&s;h to repair the injuries of wounds are vi&s;ible to the eye; as well as the callous matter, which cements broken bones; the calcareous matter, which repairs injured &s;nail-&s;hells; and the threads, which are formed by &s;ilk|worms and &s;piders; which are all &s;ecreted in a &s;ofter &s;tate, and harden by ex&s;iccation, or by the contact of the air, or by ab&s;orption of their more fluid parts.</P>
<P>Whether the materials, which thus &s;upply the wa&s;te of the &s;y&s;tem, can be given any other way than by the &s;tomach, &s;o as to pre&s;erve the body for a length of time, is worth our inquiry; as ca&s;es &s;ome|times occur, in which food cannot be introduced into the &s;tomach, as in ob&s;tructions of the oe&s;ophagus, inflammations of the throat, or in hydrophobia; and other ca&s;es are not unfrequent in which the power of dige&s;tion is nearly or totally de&s;troyed, as in anorexia epilep|tica, and in many fevers.</P>
<P>In the former of the&s;e circum&s;tances liquid nutriment may &s;ome|times be got into the &s;tomach through a flexible catheter; as de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. 15. In the latter many kinds of mild aliment, as milk or broth, have frequently been injected as cly&s;ters, together with a &s;mall quantity of opium, as ten drops of the tincture, three or four times a day; to which al&s;o might be added very &s;mall quantities of vinous &s;pirit. But the&s;e, as far as I have ob&s;erved, will not long &s;u&s;tain a per&s;on, who cannot take any &s;u&s;tenance by the &s;tomach.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another mode of applying nutritive fluids might be by exten&s;ive fomentations, or by immerging the whole body in a bath of broth, or of warm milk, which might at the &s;ame time be coagulated by rennet, or the acid of the calf's &s;tomach; broth or whey might thus probably be introduced, in part at lea&s;t, into the circulation, as a &s;o|lution of nitre is &s;aid to have been ab&s;orbed in a pediluvium, which was afterwards di&s;covered by the manner in which paper dipped frequently
<PB N="676" REF="6820">
in the urine of the patient and dried, burnt and &s;parkled like touch-paper. Great quantity of water is al&s;o known to be ab&s;orbed by tho&s;e, who have bathed in the warm bath after exerci&s;e and ab|&s;tinence from liquids. Cleopatra was &s;aid to travel with 4000 milch|a&s;&s;es in her train, and to bathe every morning in their milk, which &s;he probably might u&s;e as a co&s;metic rather than a nutritive.</P>
<P N="3">3. The transfu&s;ion of blood from another animal into the vein of one, who could take no &s;u&s;tenance by the throat, or dige&s;t none by the &s;tomach, might long continue to &s;upport him; and perhaps other nutriment, as milk or mucilage, might be this way introduced into the &s;y&s;tem, but we have not yet &s;ufficient experiments on this &s;ub|ject. See Sect. XXXII. 4. and Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 25. and Sup. I. 14. 2.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Various kinds of condiments, or &s;auces, have been taken along with vegetable or animal food, and have been thought by &s;ome to &s;trengthen the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion and con&s;equent proce&s;s of nu|trition. Of the&s;e wine, or other fermented liquors, vinegar, &s;alt, &s;pices, and mu&s;tard, have been in mo&s;t common u&s;e, and I believe to the injury of thou&s;ands. As the &s;tomach by their violent &s;timulus at length lo&s;es its natural degree of irritability, and indige&s;tion is the con&s;equence; which is attended with flatulency and emaciation. Where any of the&s;e have been taken &s;o long as to induce a habit, they mu&s;t either be continued, but not increa&s;ed; or the u&s;e of them &s;hould be gradually and cautiou&s;ly dimini&s;hed or di&s;continued, as di|rected in Sect.

But as they at the &s;ame time promote ab&s;orption; tho&s;e fluids, which are &s;ecreted into receptacles, as the urine, bile, inte&s;tinal and pulmonary mucus, have again their thinner parts ab&s;orbed; and hence, though the quantity of &s;ecreted fluid was increa&s;ed, yet as the ab&s;orption was al&s;o increa&s;ed, the excretion from the&s;e receptacles is le&s;&s;ened; at the &s;ame time that it is deeper coloured or of thicker con&s;i&s;tence, as the urine, alvine feces, and pulmonary mucus. Where|as the per&s;piration being &s;ecreted on the &s;urface of the body is vi&s;ible in its increa&s;ed quantity, before it can be reab&s;orb$d; whence ari&s;es that erroneous opinion, that opium increa&s;es the cutaneous &s;ecretion, and le&s;&s;ens all the others.</P>
<P N="3">3. It mu&s;t however be noted, that after evacuations opium &s;eems to promote the ab&s;orptions more than the &s;ecretions; if you except that of the &s;en&s;orial power in the brain, which probably &s;uffers no ab&s;orption. Hence its efficacy in re&s;training haemorrhages, after the ve&s;&s;els are emptied, by promoting venous ab&s;orption.</P>
<P N="4">4. In ulcers the matter is thickened by the exhibition of opium from the increa&s;ed ab&s;orption of the thinner parts of it; but it is probable, that the whole &s;ecretion, including the part which is ab|&s;orbed, is increa&s;ed; and hence new fibres are &s;ecreted along with the matter, and the ulcer fills with new granulations of fle&s;h. But as no ulcer can heal, till it cea&s;es to di&s;charge; that is, till the ab&s;orption becomes as great as the excretion; tho&s;e medicines, which promote ab&s;orption only, are more advantageous for the healing an ulcer after it is filled with new fle&s;h; as the Peruvian bark internally; with bandages and &s;olutions of lead externally.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="680" REF="6860">
5. There are many pains which originate from a want of due mo|tion in the part, as tho&s;e occa&s;ioned by cold; and all tho&s;e pains which are attended with cold extremities, and are generally termed nervous. The&s;e are relieved by whatever excites the part into its proper actions, and hence by opium and alcohol; which are the mo&s;t univer&s;al &s;ti|mulants we are acquainted with. In the&s;e ca&s;es the effect of opium is produced, as &s;oon as the body becomes generally warm; and a de|gree of intoxication or &s;leep follows the ce&s;&s;ation of the pain.</P>
<P>The&s;e nervous pains (as they are called) frequently return at cer|tain periods of time, and are al&s;o frequently &s;ucceeded by convul&s;ions; in the&s;e ca&s;es if opium removes the pain, the convul&s;ions do not come on. For this purpo&s;e it is be&s;t to exhibit it gradually, as a grain every hour, or half hour, till it intoxicates. Here it mu&s;t be noted, that a much le&s;s quantity will prevent the periods of the&s;e cold pains, than is nece&s;&s;ary to relieve them after their acce&s;s. As a grain and half of opium given an hour before the expected paroxy&s;m will pre|vent the cold fit of an intermittent fever, but will not &s;oon remove it, when it is already formed. For in the former ca&s;e the u&s;ual or healthy a&s;&s;ociations or catenations of motion favour the effect of the medicine; in the latter ca&s;e the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations or catenations are di&s;|ordered, or interrupted, and new ones are formed, which &s;o far coun|teract the effect of the medicine.</P>
<P>When opium has been required in large do&s;es to ea&s;e or prevent convul&s;ions, &s;ome have advi&s;ed the patient to omit the u&s;e of wine, as a greater quantity of opium might then be exhibited; and as opium &s;eems to increa&s;e ab&s;orption more, and &s;ecretion le&s;s, than vinous &s;pirit; it may in &s;ome ca&s;es be u&s;eful to exchange one for the other; as in di&s;ea&s;es attended with too great evacuation, as diarrhoea, and dy|&s;entery, opium may be preferable; on the contrary in tetanus, or locked-jaw, where inflammation of the &s;y&s;tem might be of &s;ervice, wine may be preferable to opium; &s;ee Cla&s;s III. 1. 1. 12. I have generally ob&s;erved, that a mixture of &s;pirit of wine and warm water,
<PB N="681" REF="6870">
given alternately with the do&s;es of opium, has &s;oone&s;t and mo&s;t cer|tainly produced that degree of intoxication, which was nece&s;&s;ary to relieve the patient in the epilep&s;ia dolorofica.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is likewi&s;e &s;ome relief given by opium to inflammatory pains, or tho&s;e from exce&s;s of motion in the affected part; but with this difference, that this relief from the pains, and the &s;leep, which it occa&s;ions, does not occur till &s;ome hours after the exhibition of the opium. This requires to be explained; after the &s;timulus of opium or of alcohol cea&s;es, as after common drunkenne&s;s, a con&s;equent tor|por comes on; and the whole habit becomes le&s;s irritable by the na|tural &s;timuli. Hence the head-achs, &s;ickne&s;s, and languor, on the next day after intoxication, with cold &s;kin, and general debility. Now in pains from exce&s;s of motion, called inflammatory pains, when opium is given, the pain is not relieved, till the debility comes on after the &s;timulus cea&s;es to act; for then after the greater &s;timulus of the opium has exhau&s;ted much of the &s;en&s;orial power; the le&s;s &s;ti|mulus, which before cau&s;ed the pain, does not now excite the part into unnatural action.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ca&s;es the &s;timulus of the opium fir&s;t increa&s;es the pain; and it &s;ometimes happens, that &s;o great a torpor follows, as to produce the death or mortification of the affected part; whence the danger of giving opium in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially in inflammation of the bowels; but in general the pain returns with its former violence, when the torpor above mentioned cea&s;es. Hence the&s;e pains attended with inflammation are be&s;t relieved by copious vene&s;ection, other eva|cuations, and the cla&s;s of medicines called torpentia.</P>
<P N="7">7. The&s;e pains from exce&s;s of motion are attended with increa&s;ed heat of the whole, or of the affected part, and a &s;trong quick pul&s;e; the pains from defect of motion are attended with cold extremities,
<PB N="682" REF="6880">
and a weak pul&s;e; which is al&s;o generally more frequent than natural, but not always &s;o.</P>
<P N="8">8. Opium and alcohol are the only two drugs, we are much ac|quainted with, which intoxicate; and by this circum&s;tance are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;ecernentia and &s;orbentia. Camphor, and ci|cuta, and nicotiana, are thought to induce a kind of intoxication; and there are many other drugs of this cla&s;s, who&s;e effects are le&s;s known, or their do&s;es not a&s;certained; as atropa belladonna, hyocy|amus, &s;tramonium, prunus laurocera&s;us, meni&s;permum, cynoglo&s;|&s;um, &s;ome fungi, and the water di&s;tilled from black cherry-&s;tones; the la&s;t of which was once much in u&s;e for the convul&s;ions of chil|dren, and was &s;aid to have good effect; but is now improvidently left out of our pharmacopias. I have known one leaf of the laurocera&s;u$, &s;hred and made into tea, given every morning for a week with no ill con&s;equence to a weak hy&s;teric lady, but rather perhaps with ad|vantage.</P>
<P N="9">9. The pernicious effects of a continued u&s;e of much vinous &s;pirit is daily &s;een and lamented by phy&s;icians; not only early debility, like premature age, but a dreadful catalogue of di&s;ea&s;es is induced by this kind of intemperance; as drop&s;y, gout, lepro&s;y, epilep&s;y, in&s;anity, as de&s;cribed in Botanic Garden, Part II. Canto III. line 357. The &s;tronger or le&s;s diluted the &s;pirit is taken, the &s;ooner it &s;eems to de|&s;troy, as in dram-drinkers; but &s;till &s;ooner, when kernels of apricots, or bitter almonds, or laurel-leaf, are infu&s;ed in the &s;pirit, which is termed rata&s;ia; as then two poi&s;ons are &s;wallowed at the &s;ame time. And vinegar, as it contains much vinous &s;pirit, is probably a noxious part of our diet. And the di&s;tilled vinegar, which is commonly &s;old in the &s;hops, is truly poi&s;onous, as it is generally di&s;tilled by means of a pewter or leaden alembic-head or worm-tube, and abounds with
<PB N="683" REF="6890">
lead; which any one may detect by mixing with it a &s;olution of liver of &s;ulphur. Opium, when taken as a luxury, not as a medicine, is as pernicious as alcohol; as Baron de Tott relates in his account of the opium-eaters in Turkey.</P>
<P N="10">10. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that a frequent repetition of the u&s;e of this cla&s;s of medicines &s;o habituates the body to their &s;timulus, that their do&s;e may gradually be increa&s;ed to an a&s;toni&s;hing quantity, &s;uch as otherwi&s;e would in&s;tantly de&s;troy life; as is frequently &s;een in tho&s;e, who accu&s;tom them&s;elves to the daily u&s;e of alcohol and opi|um; and it would &s;eem, that the&s;e unfortunate people become di&s;|ea&s;ed as &s;oon as they omit their u&s;ual potations; and that the con&s;e|quent gout, drop&s;y, pal&s;y, or pimpled face, occur from the debility occa&s;ioned from the want of accu&s;tomed &s;timulus, or to. &s;ome change in the contractile fibres, which requires the continuance or increa&s;e of it. Whence the cautions nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved are mentioned in Sect. XII. 7. 8.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is probable, that &s;ome of the articles in the &s;ub&s;equent cata|logue do not induce intoxication, though they have been e&s;teemed to do &s;o; as tobacco, hemlock, nux vomica, &s;tavi&s;agria; and on this account &s;hould rather belong to other arrangements, as to the &s;ecer|nentia, or &s;orbentia, or invertentia.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. Externally the application of heat, as the warm bath, by its &s;timulus on the &s;kin excites the excretory ducts of the per&s;pirative glands, and the mouths of the lymphatics, which open on its furface, into greater action; and in con&s;equence many other irritative motions, which are a&s;&s;ociated with them. To this increa&s;ed action is added plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation, which adds further activity to the &s;y&s;tem; and thus many kinds of pain receive relief from this additional atmo&s;phere of heat.</P>
<P><PB N="684" REF="6900">
The u&s;e of a warm bath of about 96 or 98 degrees of heat, for half an hour once a day for three or four months, I have known of great &s;ervice to weak people, and is perhaps the lea&s;t noxious of all unnatural &s;timuli; which however, like all other great excitement, may be carried to exce&s;s, as complained of by the ancients. The un|meaning application of the words relaxation and bracing to warm and cold baths has much prevented the u&s;e of this grateful &s;timulus; and the mi&s;u&s;e of the term warm-bath, when applied to baths colder than the body, as to tho&s;e of Buxton and Matlock, and to artificial baths of le&s;s than 90 degrees of heat, which ought to be termed cold ones, has contributed to mi&s;lead the unwary in their application.</P>
<P>The &s;timulus of wine, or &s;pice, or &s;alt, increa&s;es the heat of the &s;y&s;tem by increa&s;ing all or &s;ome of the &s;ecretions; and hence the &s;trength is dimini&s;hed afterwards by the lo&s;s of fluids, as well as by the increa&s;ed action of the fibres. But the &s;timulus of the warm|bath &s;upplies heat rather than produces it; and rather fills the &s;y&s;tem by increa&s;ed ab&s;orption, than empties it by increa&s;ed &s;ecretion; and may hence be employed with advantage in almo&s;t all ca&s;es of debility with cold extremities, perhaps even in ana&s;arca, and at the approach of death in fevers. In the&s;e ca&s;es a bath much beneath 98 degrees, as of 80 or 85, might do injury, as being a cold-bath compared with the heat of the body, though &s;uch a bath is generally called a warm one.</P>
<P>The activity of the &s;y&s;tem thus produced by a bath of 98 degrees of heat, or upwards, does not &s;eem to render the patients liable to take cold, when they come out of it; for the &s;y&s;tem is le&s;s inclined to become torpid than before, as the warmth thus acquired by com|munication, rather than by increa&s;ed action, continues long without any con&s;equent chillne&s;s. Which accords with the ob&s;ervation of Dr. Fordyce, mentioned in Sup. I. 5. 1. who &s;ays, that tho&s;e who are confined &s;ome time in an atmo&s;phere of 120 or 130 degrees of heat, do not feel cold or look pale on coming into a temperature of
<PB N="685" REF="6910">
30 or 40 degrees; which would produce great palene&s;s and &s;en&s;ation of coldne&s;s in tho&s;e, who had been &s;ome time confined in an atmo|&s;phere of only 86 or 90 degrees of heat. Treati&s;e on Simple Fever, p. 168.</P>
<P>Hence heat, where it can be confined on a torpid part along with moi&s;ture, as on a &s;crophulous tumour, will contribute to produce &s;up|puration or re&s;olution. This is done by applying a warm poultice, which &s;hould be frequently repeated; or a pla&s;ter of re&s;in, wax, or fat; or by covering the part with oiled &s;ilk; both which la&s;t prevent the per&s;pirable matter from e&s;caping as well as the heat of the part, as the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances repel moi&s;ture, and are bad conductors of heat. Another great u&s;e of the &s;timulus of heat is by applying it to torpid ulcers, which are generally termed &s;crophulous or &s;corbutic, and are much ea&s;ier inclined to heal, when covered with &s;everal folds of flannel.</P>
<P>Mr.&mdash;had for many months been afflicted with an ulcer in pe|rinaeo, which communicated with the urethra, through which a part of his urine was daily evacuated with con&s;iderable pain; and was re|duced to a great degree of debility. He u&s;ed a hot-bath of 96 or 98 degrees of heat every day for half an hour during about &s;ix months. By this agreeable &s;timulus repeated thus at uniform times not only the ulcer healed, contrary to the expectation of his friends, but he acquired greater health and &s;trength, than he had for &s;ome years pre|viou&s;ly experienced.</P>
<P>Mrs.&mdash;was affected with tran&s;ient pains, which were called nervous &s;pa&s;ms, and with great fear of di&s;ea&s;es, which &s;he did not labour under, with cold extremities, and general debility. She u&s;ed a hot-bath every other day of 96 degrees of heat for about four months, and recovered a good &s;tate of health, with greater &s;trength and courage, than &s;he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for many months before.</P>
<P>Mr. Z. a gentleman about 65 years of age, who had lived rather intemperately in re&s;pect to vinous potation, and had for many years
<PB N="686" REF="6920">
had annual vi&s;its of the gout, which now became irregular, and he appeared to be lo&s;ing his &s;trength, and beginning to feel the effects of age. He u&s;ed a bath, as hot as was agreeable to his &s;en&s;ations, twice a week for about a year and half, and greatly recovered his health and &s;trength with le&s;s frequent and le&s;s violent returns of regular gout, and is now near 80 years of age.</P>
<P>When Dr. Franklin, the American philo&s;opher, was in England many years ago, I recommended to him the u&s;e of a warm-bath twice a week to prevent the too &s;peedy acce&s;s of old age, which he then thought that he felt the approach of, and I have been informed, that he continued the u&s;e of it till near his death, which was at an advanced age.</P>
<P>All the&s;e patients were advi&s;ed not to keep them&s;elves warmer than their u&s;ual habits, after they came out of the bath, whether they went into bed or not; as the de&s;ign was not to promote per&s;piration, which weakens all con&s;titutions, and &s;eldom is of &s;ervice to any. Thus a flannel &s;hirt, particularly if it be worn in warm weather, oc|ca&s;ions weakne&s;s by &s;timulating the &s;kin by its points into too great action, and producing heat in con&s;equence; and occa&s;ions emaciation by increa&s;ing the di&s;charge of per&s;pirable matter; and in both the&s;e re&s;pects differs from the effect of warm bathing, which communicates heat to the &s;y&s;tem at the &s;ame time that it &s;timulates it, and cau&s;es ab&s;orption more than exhalation.</P>

Electric &s;hocks frequently repeated daily for a week or two remove chronical pains, as the pleurodyne chronica, Cla&s;s I. 2. 4. 14. and other chronic pains, which are termed rheumatic, probably by promoting the ab&s;orption of &s;ome extrava&s;ated material.

tumours are &s;ometimes ab&s;orbed, and &s;ometimes brought to &s;uppurate by pa&s;&s;ing electric &s;hocks through them daily for two or three weeks.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s&mdash;, a young lady about eight years of age, had a &s;welling about the &s;ize of a pigeon's egg on her neck a little below her ear, which long continued in an indolent &s;tate. Thirty or forty &s;mall electric &s;hocks were pa&s;&s;ed through it once or twice a day for two or three weeks, and it then &s;uppurated and healed without difficulty. For this operation the coated jar of the electric machine had on its top an electrometer, which mea&s;ured the &s;hocks by the approach of a bra&s;s knob, which communicated with the external coating to another, which communicated with the internal one, and their di&s;tance was adju&s;ted by a &s;crew. So that the &s;hocks were &s;o &s;mall as not to alarm the child, and the accumulated electricity was frequently di&s;charged, as the wheel continued turning. The tumour was inclo&s;ed between two other bra&s;s knobs, which were fixed on wires, which pa&s;&s;ed through gla&s;s tubes, the tubes were cemented in two grooves on a board, &s;o that at one end they were nearer each other than at the other, and the knobs were pu&s;hed out &s;o far as exactly to include the tumour, as de&s;cribed in the annexed plate, which is about half the &s;ize of the original apparatus.</P>
<P>Inflammations of the eyes without fever are frequently cured by taking a &s;tream of very &s;mall electric &s;parks from them, or giving the electric &s;parks to them, once or twice a day for a week or two; that is, the new ve&s;&s;els, which con&s;titute inflammation in the&s;e inirritable con&s;titutions, are ab&s;orbed by the activity of the ab&s;orbents induced by the &s;timulus of the electric aura. For this operation the ea&s;ie&s;t method is to &s;ix a pointed wire to a &s;tick of &s;ealing wax, or to an in|&s;ulating handle of gla&s;s, one end of this wire communicates with the prime conductor, and the point is approached near the inflamed eye in every direction.</P>

III. Externally the application of ether, and of e&s;&s;ential oils, as of cloves or cinnamon, &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s a general &s;timulating effect. As they in&s;tantly relieve tooth-ach, and hiccough, when the&s;e pains are not in violent degree; and camphor in large do&s;es is &s;aid to produce intoxication; this effect however I have not been witne&s;s to, and have rea&s;on to doubt.</P>
<P>The manner in which ether and the e&s;&s;ential oil operate on the &s;y&s;tem when applied externally, is a curious que&s;tion, as pain is &s;o immediately relieved by them, that they mu&s;t &s;eem to penetrate by the great fluidity or expan&s;ive property of a part of them, as of their odoriferous exhalation or vapour, and that they thus &s;timulate the torpid part, and not by their being taken up by the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, and carried thither by the long cour&s;e of circulation; nor is it pro|bable, that the&s;e pains are relieved by the &s;ympathy of the torpid membrane with the external &s;kin, which is thus &s;timulated into ac|tion; as it does not &s;ucceed, unle&s;s it is applied over the pained part. Thus there appears to be three different modes by which extraneous bodies may be introduced into the &s;y&s;tem, be&s;ides that of ab&s;orption. 1&s;t. By ethereal tran&s;ition, as heat and electricity; 2d. by chemical attraction, as oxygen; and 3d. by expan&s;ive vapour, as ether and e&s;|&s;ential oils.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The perpetual nece&s;&s;ity of the mixture of oxygen gas with the blood in the lungs evinces, that it mu&s;t act as a &s;timulus to the &s;an|guiferous &s;y&s;tem, as the motions of the heart and arteries pre&s;ently cea&s;e, when animals are immer&s;ed in airs which po&s;&s;e&s;s no oxygen. It may al&s;o &s;ub&s;equently an&s;wer another important purpo&s;e, as it probably affords the material for the production of the &s;en&s;orial power; which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ecreted in the brain or medullary part of the nerves; and that the perpetual demand of this fluid in re|&s;piration is occa&s;ioned by the &s;en&s;orial power, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be
<PB N="689" REF="6960">
produced from it, being too &s;ubtle to be long confined in any part of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Another proof of the &s;timulant quality of oxygen appears from the increa&s;ed acrimony, which the matter of a common ab&s;ce&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, after it has been expo&s;ed to the air of the atmo&s;phere, but not be|fore; and probably all other contagious matters owe their fever-pro|ducing property to having been converted into acids by their union with oxygen.</P>
<P>As oxygen penetrates the fine moi&s;t membranes of the air-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, and unites with the blood by a chemical attraction, as is &s;een to happen, when blood is drawn into a ba&s;on, the lower &s;urface of the cra&s;&s;amentum is of a very dark red &s;o long as it is covered from the air by the upper &s;urface, but becomes florid in a &s;hort time on its being expo&s;ed to the atmo&s;phere; the manner of its introduction into the &s;y&s;tem is not probably by animal ab&s;orption but by chemical attraction, in which circum&s;tance it differs from the fluids before mentioned both of heat and electricity, and of ether and e&s;&s;ential oils.</P>
<P>As oxygen has the property of pa&s;&s;ing through moi&s;t animal mem|branes, as fir&s;t di&s;covered by the great Dr. Prie&s;tley, it is probable it might be of u&s;e in vibices, and petechiae in fevers, and in other brui&s;es; if the &s;kin over tho&s;e parts was kept moi&s;t by warm water, and covered with oxygen gas by means of an inverted gla&s;s, or even by expo&s;ing the parts thus moi&s;tened to the atmo&s;phere, as the dark coloured extrava&s;ated blood might thus become florid, and by its in|crea&s;e of &s;timulus facilitate its reab&s;orption.</P>
<P>Two weak patients, to whom I gave oxygen gas in as pure a &s;tate as it can ea&s;ily be procured from Exeter mangane&s;e, and in the quan|tity of about four gallons a day, &s;eemed to feel refre&s;hed, and &s;tronger, and to look better immediately after re&s;piring it, and gained &s;trength in a &s;hort time. Two others, one of whom laboured under confirmed
<PB N="690" REF="6970">
hydrothorax, and the other under a permanent and uniform difficulty of re&s;piration, were not refre&s;hed, or in any way &s;erved by the u&s;e of oxygen in the above quantity of four gallons a day for a fort|night, which I a&s;cribed to the inirritability of the di&s;ea&s;ed lungs. For other ca&s;es the reader is referred to the publications of Dr. Bed|does; Con&s;iderations on the U&s;e of Factitious Airs, &s;old by John&s;on, London.</P>
<P>Its effects would probably have been greater in re&s;pect to the quan|tity breathed, if it had been given in a dilute &s;tate, mixed with 10 or 20 times its quantity of atmo&s;pheric air, as otherwi&s;e much of it returns by expiration without being deprived of its quality, as may be &s;een by the per&s;on breathing on the flame of a candle, which it enlarges. See the Treati&s;e of Dr. Beddoes above mentioned.</P>
<P N="5">V. Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which are attended with plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ation, excite the &s;y&s;tem into increa&s;ed action in con&s;equence of that &s;en&s;a|tion, as joy, and love, as is &s;een by the flu&s;h of the &s;kin.

Be&s;ides the exertions of the &s;y&s;tem occa&s;ioned by increa&s;ed &s;ti|muli, and con&s;equent irritation, and by the pa&s;&s;ions of the mind above de&s;cribed, the increa&s;ed actions occa&s;ioned by exerci&s;e belong to this article. The&s;e may be divided into the actions of the body in con&s;equence of volition, which is generally termed labour; or &s;e|condly, in con&s;equence of agreeable &s;en&s;ation, which is termed play
<PB N="691" REF="6980">
or &s;port; thirdly, the exerci&s;e occa&s;ioned by agitation, as in a car|riage or on hor&s;eback; fourthly, that of friction, as with a bru&s;h or hand, &s;o much u&s;ed in the baths of Turkey; and la&s;tly, the exerci&s;e of &s;winging.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e modes of exerci&s;e is frequently carried to great exce&s;s even among&s;t our own labourers, and more &s;o under the la&s;h of &s;lavery; &s;o that the body becomes emaciated and &s;inks under either the pre&s;ent hard&s;hips, or by a premature old age. The &s;econd mode of exerci&s;e is &s;een in the play of all young animals, as kittens, and puppies, and children; and is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their health as well as to their plea&s;ure, that tho&s;e children, which are too much confined from it, not only become pale-faced and bloated, with tumid bellies, and con&s;equent worms, but are liable to get habits of unnatural ac|tions, as twitching of their limbs, or of &s;ome parts of their counte|nance; together with an ill-humoured or di&s;contented mind.</P>
<P>Agitation in a carriage or on hor&s;eback, as it requires &s;ome little voluntary exertion to pre&s;erve the body perpendicular, but much le&s;s voluntary exertion than in walking, &s;eems the be&s;t adapted to invalids; who by the&s;e means obtain exerci&s;e principally by the &s;trength of the hor&s;e, and do not therefore too much exhau&s;t their own &s;en&s;orial power. The u&s;e of friction with a bru&s;h or hand, for half an hour or longer morning and evening, is &s;till better adapted to tho&s;e, who are reduced to extreme debility; and none of their own &s;en&s;orial power is thus expended, and affords &s;omewhat like the warm|bath activity without &s;elf-exertion, and is u&s;ed as a luxury after warm bathing in many parts of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>Another kind of exerci&s;e is that of &s;winging, which requires &s;ome exertion to keep the body perpendicular, or pointing towards the center of the &s;wing, but is at the &s;ame time attended with a degree of vertigo; and is de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s II. 1. 6. 7. IV. 2. 1. 10. Sup. I. 3. and 15.</P>
<P><PB N="692" REF="6990">
The nece&s;&s;ity of much exerci&s;e has perhaps been more in&s;i&s;ted upon by phy&s;icians, than nature &s;eems to demand. Few animals ex|erci&s;e them&s;elves &s;o as to induce vi&s;ible &s;weat, unle&s;s urged to it by mankind, or by fear, or hunger. And numbers of people in our market towns, of ladies particularly, with &s;mall fortunes, live to old age in health, without any kind of exerci&s;e of body, or much activity of mind.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer weak people cannot continue too long in the air, if it can be done without fatigue; and in winter they &s;hould go out &s;everal times in a day for a few minutes, u&s;ing the cold air like a cold-bath, to invigorate and render them more hardy.</P>

See Botanic Garden, Part II. Canto IV. line 221. Spices taken to exce&s;s by &s;timulating the &s;tomach, and the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin by a&s;&s;ociation, into unnece&s;&s;ary action, contribute to weaken the&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, but are probably le&s;s noxious than the general u&s;e of &s;o much &s;alt.</P>

<PB N="696" REF="7030">
<HEAD>II. OBSERVATIONS ON THE SECERNENTIA.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. 1. Some of the medicines of this cla&s;s produce ab&s;orption in &s;ome degree, though their principal effect is exerted on the &s;ecerning part of our &s;y&s;tem. We &s;hall have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve a &s;imilar cir|cum&s;tance in the next cla&s;s of medicines termed Sorbentia; as of the&s;e &s;ome exert their effects in a &s;maller degree on the &s;ecerning &s;y&s;tem. Nor will this &s;urpri&s;e any one, who has ob&s;erved, that all natural objects are pre&s;ented to us in a &s;tate of combination; and that hence the materials, which produce the&s;e different effects, are frequently found mingled in the &s;ame vegetable. Thus the pure aromatics in|crea&s;e the action of the ve&s;&s;els, which &s;ecrete the per&s;pirable matter; and the pure a&s;tringents increa&s;e the action of the ve&s;&s;els, which ab|&s;orb the mucus from the lungs, and other cavities of the body; hence it mu&s;t happen, that nutmeg, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es both the&s;e qua|lities, &s;hould have the double effect above mentioned.</P>
<P>Other drugs have this double effect, and belong either to the cla&s;s of Secernentia or Sorbentia, according to the do&s;e in which they are exhibited. Thus a &s;mall do&s;e of alum increa&s;es ab&s;orption, and in|duces co&s;tivene&s;s; and a large one increa&s;es the &s;ecretions into the inte&s;tinal canal, and becomes cathartic. And this accounts for the con&s;tipation of the belly left after the purgative quality of rhubarb cea&s;es, for it increa&s;es ab&s;orption in a &s;maller do&s;e, and &s;ecretion in a greater. Hence when a part of the larger do&s;e is carried out of the habit by &s;t$ols, the &s;mall quantity which remains induces co&s;tivene&s;s. Hence rhubarb exhibited in &s;mall do&s;es, as 2 or 3 grains twice a day, &s;trengthens the &s;y&s;tem by increa&s;ing the action of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;|&s;els, and of the inte&s;tinal canal.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="697" REF="7040">
2. Diaphoretics. The per&s;piration is a &s;ecretion from the blood in its pa&s;&s;age through the capillary ve&s;&s;els, as other &s;ecretions are pro|duced in the termination of the arteries in the various glands. After this &s;ecretion the blood lo&s;es its florid colour, which it regains in its pa&s;&s;age through the lungs; which evinces that &s;omething be&s;ides wa|ter is &s;ecreted on the &s;kins of animals.</P>
<P>No &s;tatical experiments can a&s;certain the quantity of our per&s;pira|tion; as a continued ab&s;orption of the moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere exi&s;ts at the &s;ame time both by the cutaneous and pulmonary lym|phatics.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every gland is capable of being excited into greater exertions by an appropriated &s;timulus applied either by its mixture with the blood immediately to the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;el, or applied externally to its excre|tory duct. Thus mercury internally promotes an increa&s;ed &s;alivation, and pyrethrum externally applied to the excretory ducts of the &s;alival glands. Aloes &s;timulate the rectum internally mixed with the cir|culating blood; and &s;ea-&s;alt by injection externally. Now as the ca|pillaries, which &s;ecrete the per&s;pirable matter, lie near the &s;urface of the body, the application of external heat acts immediately on their excretory ducts, and promotes per&s;piration; internally tho&s;e drugs which po&s;&s;e&s;s a fragrant e&s;&s;ential oil, or &s;piritus rector, produce this effect, as the aromatic vegetables, of which the number is very great.</P>
<P N="4">4. It mu&s;t be remembered, that a due quantity of &s;ome aqueous vehicle mu&s;t be given to &s;upport this evacuation; otherwi&s;e a burning heat without much vi&s;ible &s;weat mu&s;t be the con&s;equence. When the &s;kin acquires a degree of heat much above 108, as appears by Dr. Alexander's experiments, no vi&s;ible &s;weat is produced; which is owing to the great heat of the &s;kin evaporating it as ha&s;tily, as it is
<PB N="698" REF="7050">
&s;ecreted; and, where the &s;weat is &s;ecreted in abundance, its evapora|tion cannot carry off the exuberant heat, like the vapour of boiling water; becau&s;e a great part of it is wiped off, or ab&s;orbed by the bed|clothes; or the air about the patient is not changed &s;ufficiently often, as it becomes &s;aturated with the per&s;pirable matter. And hence it is probable, that the wa&s;te of per&s;pirable matter is as great, or greater, when the &s;kin is hot and dry, as when it &s;tands in drops on the &s;kin; as appears from the inextingui&s;hable thir&s;t.</P>
<P>Hence Dr. Alexander found, that when the heat of the body was greater than 108, nothing produced &s;weats but repeated draughts of cold water; and of warm fluids, when the heat was much below that degree. And that cold water which procured &s;weats in&s;tantaneou&s;ly when the heat was above 108, &s;topped them as certainly when it was below that heat; and that flannels, wrung out of warm water and wrapped round the legs and thighs, were then mo&s;t certainly pro|ductive of &s;weats.</P>
<P N="5">5. The diaphoretics are all &s;aid to &s;ucceed much better, if given early in the morning, about an hour before &s;un-ri&s;e, than at any other time; which is owing to the great excitability of every part of the &s;y&s;tem after the &s;en&s;orial power has been accumulated during &s;leep. In tho&s;e, who have hectic fever, or the febricula, or nocturnal fever of debility, the morning &s;weats are owing to the decline of the fever-fit, as explained in Sect. XXXII. 9. In &s;ome of the&s;e patients the &s;weat does not occur till they awake; becau&s;e then the &s;y&s;tem is &s;till more excitable than during &s;leep, becau&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the vo|luntary power in re&s;piration facilitates the general circulation. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 1. 3.</P>
<P N="6">6. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the &s;kin is very dry and hard to the touch, where the ab&s;orbents, which open on its &s;urface, do not act; as
<PB N="699" REF="7060">
in &s;ome drop&s;ies, and other di&s;ea&s;es attended with great thir&s;t. This dryne&s;s, and &s;hrivelled appearance, and roughne&s;s, are owing to the mouths of the ab&s;orbents being empty of their accu&s;tomed fluid, and is di&s;tingui&s;hable from the dryne&s;s of the &s;kin above mentioned in the hot fits of fever, by its not being attended with heat.</P>
<P>As the heat of the &s;kin in the u&s;ual temperature of the air always evinces an increa&s;ed per&s;piration, whether vi&s;ible or not, the heat being produced along with the increa&s;e of &s;ecretion; it follows, that a defect of per&s;piration can only exi&s;t, when the &s;kin is cold.</P>
<P N="7">7. Volatile alcali is a very powerful diaphoretic, and particularly if exhibited in wine-whey; 20 drops of &s;pirit of hart&s;horn every half hour in half a pint of wine-whey, if the patient be kept in a mode|rately warm bed, will in a few hours elicit mo&s;t profu&s;e &s;weats.</P>
<P>Neutral &s;alts promote invi&s;ible per&s;piration, when the &s;kin is not warmed much externally, as is evinced from the great thir&s;t, which &s;ucceeds a meal of &s;alt provi&s;ions, as of red herrings. When the&s;e are &s;ufficiently diluted with water, and the &s;kin kept warm, copious &s;weats without inflaming the habit, are the con&s;equence. Half an ounce of vinegar &s;aturated with volatile alcali, taken every hour or two hours, well an&s;wers this purpo&s;e; and is preferable perhaps in general to all others, where &s;weating is advantageous. Bocrhaave mentions one cured of a fever by eating red-herrings or anchovies, which, with repeated draughts of warm water or tea, would I &s;uppo&s;e produce copious per&s;piration.</P>
<P>Antimonial preparations have al&s;o been of late much u&s;ed with great advantage as diaphoretics. For the hi&s;tory and u&s;e of the&s;e pre|parations I &s;hall refer the reader to the late writers on the Materia Medica, only ob&s;erving that the &s;tomach becomes &s;o &s;oon habituated to its &s;timulus, that the &s;econd do&s;e may be con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, if the fir&s;t had no operation.</P>
<P><PB N="700" REF="7070">
Where it is advi&s;able to procure copious &s;weats, the emetics, as ipecacuanha, joined with opiates, as in Dover's powder, produce this effect with greater certainty than the above.</P>
<P N="8">8. We mu&s;t not di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject without ob&s;erving, that per|&s;piration is de&s;igned to keep the &s;kin flexile, as the tears are intended to clean and lubricate the eye; and that neither of the&s;e fluids can be con&s;idered as excretions in their natural &s;tate, but as &s;ecretions. See Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 3. And that therefore the principal u&s;e of diaphoretic medicines is to warm the &s;kin, and thence in con&s;equence to produce the natural degree of in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration in languid habits.</P>
<P N="9">9. When the &s;kin of the extremities is cold, which is always a &s;ign of pre&s;ent debility, the dige&s;tion becomes frequently impaired by a&s;|&s;ociation, and cardialgia or heartburn is induced from the vinous or acetous fermentation of the aliment. In this di&s;ea&s;e diaphoretics, which have been called cordials, by their action on the &s;tomach re&s;tore its exertion, and that of the cutaneous capillaries by their a&s;&s;ociation with it, and the &s;kin becomes warm, and the dige&s;tion more vigorous.</P>
<P N="10">10. But a bli&s;ter acts with more permanent and certain effect by &s;timulating a part of the &s;kin, and thence affecting the whole of it, and of the &s;tomach by a&s;&s;ociation, and thence removes the mo&s;t ob|&s;tinate heartburns and vomitings. From this the principal u&s;e of bli&s;|ters is under&s;tood, which is to invigorate the exertions of the arterial and lymphatic ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, producing an increa&s;e of in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, and of cutaneous ab&s;orption; and to increa&s;e the action of the &s;tomach, and the con&s;equent power of dige&s;tion; and thence by &s;ympathy to excite all the other irritative motions: hence they re|lieve pains of the cold kind, which originate from defect of motion;
<PB N="701" REF="7080">
not from their introducing a greater pain, as &s;ome have imagined, but by &s;timulating the torpid ve&s;&s;els into their u&s;ual action; and thence increa&s;ing the action and con&s;equent warmth of the whole &s;kin, and of all the parts which are a&s;&s;ociated with it.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. <HI>Sialagogues.</HI> The preparations of mercury con&s;i&s;t of a &s;o|lution or corro&s;ion of that metal by &s;ome acid; and, when the do&s;e is known, it is probable that they are all equally efficacious. As their principal u&s;e is in the cure of the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, they will be mentioned in the catalogue among&s;t the &s;orbentia. Where &s;alivation is intended, it is much forwarded by a warm room and warm clothes; and prevented by expo&s;ing the patient to his u&s;ual habits of cool air and dre&s;s, as the mercury is then more liable to go off by the bowels.</P>
<P N="2">2. Any acrid drug, as pyrethrum, held in the mouth acts as a &s;ia|lagogue externally by &s;timulating the excretory ducts of the &s;alivary glands; and the &s;iliqua hir&s;uta applied externally to the parotid gland, and even hard &s;ub&s;tances in the ear, are &s;aid to have the &s;ame effect. Ma&s;tich chewed in the mouth emulges the &s;alivary glands.</P>
<P N="3">3. The unwi&s;e cu&s;tom of chewing and &s;moking tobacco for many hours in a day not only injures the &s;alivary glands, producing dryne&s;s in the mouth when this drug is not u&s;ed, but I &s;u&s;pect that it al&s;o produces &s;chirrhus of the pancreas. The u&s;e of tobacco in this immo|derate degree injures the power of dige&s;tion, by occa&s;ioning the pa|tient to &s;pit out that &s;aliva, which he ought to &s;wallow; and hence produces that flatulency, which the vulgar unfortunately take it to prevent. The mucus, which is brought from the &s;auces by hawking, &s;hould be &s;pit out, as well as that coughed up from the lungs; but that which comes &s;pontaneou&s;ly into the mouth from the &s;alivary
<PB N="702" REF="7090">
glands, &s;hould be &s;wallowed mixed with our food or alone for the purpo&s;es of dige&s;tion. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 7.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. Expectorants are &s;uppo&s;ed to increa&s;e the &s;ecretion of mucus in the branches of the windpipe, or to increa&s;e the per&s;piration of the lungs &s;ecreted at the terminations of the bronchial artery.</P>
<P N="2">2. If any thing promotes expectoration toward the end of pe|ripneumonies, when the inflammation is reduced by bleeding and gentle cathartics, &s;mall repeated bli&s;ters about the che&s;t, with tepid $queous and mucilaginous or oily liquids, are more advantageous than the medicines generally enumerated under this head; the bli&s;ters by &s;timulating into action the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin produce by a&s;&s;ociation a greater activity of tho&s;e of the mucous membrane, which lines the branches of the windpipe, and air-cells of the lungs; and thus after evacuation they promote the ab&s;orption of the mucus and con&s;equent healing of the inflamed membrane, while the diluting liquids prevent this mucus from becoming too vi&s;cid for this purpo&s;e, or facilitate its expuition.</P>
<P>Bli&s;ters, one at a time, on the &s;ides or back, or on the &s;ternum, are al&s;o u&s;eful towards the end of peripneumonies, by preventing the evening acce&s;s of cold fit, and thence preventing the hot fit by their &s;ti|mulus on the &s;kin; in the &s;ame manner as five drops of laudanum by its &s;timulus on the &s;tomach. For the increa&s;ed actions of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin or &s;tomach excite a greater quantity of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;o|ciation, and thus prevent the torpor of the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem; which, when patients are debilitated, is &s;o liable to return in the evening.</P>
<P N="3">3. Warm bathing is of great &s;ervice towards the end of peripneu|mony to promote expectoration, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e children who drink too little aqueous fluids, as it gently increa&s;es the action of the
<PB N="703" REF="7100">
pulmonary capillaries by their con&s;ent with the cutaneous ones, and &s;upplies the &s;y&s;tem with aqueous fluid, and thus dilutes the &s;ecreted mucus.</P>
<P>Some have recommended oil externally around the che&s;t, as well as internally, to promote expectoration; and upon the no&s;e, when its mucous membrane is inflamed, as in common catarrh.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. Diuretics. If the &s;kin be kept warm, mo&s;t of the&s;e medi|cines promote &s;weat in&s;tead of urine; and if their do&s;e is enlarged, mo&s;t of them become cathartic. Hence the neutral &s;alts are u&s;ed in general for all the&s;e purpo&s;es. Tho&s;e indeed, which are compo&s;ed of the vege|table acid, are mo&s;t generally u&s;ed as &s;udorifics; tho&s;e with the nitrous acid as diuretics; and tho&s;e with the vitriolic acid as cathartics: while tho&s;e united with the marine acid enter our common nutriment, as a more general &s;timulus. All the&s;e increa&s;e the acrimony of the urine, hence it is retained a le&s;s time in the bladder; and in con&s;equence le&s;s of it is reab&s;orbed into the &s;y&s;tem, and the apparent quantity is great|er, as more is evacuated from the bladder; but it is not certain from thence, that a greater quantity is &s;ecreted by the kidnies. Hence nitre, and other neutral &s;alts, are erroneou&s;ly given in the gonorrhoea; as they augment the pain of making water by their &s;timulus on the exco|riated or inflamed urethra. They are al&s;o erroneou&s;ly given in catarrhs or coughs, where the di&s;charge is too thin and &s;aline, as they increa&s;e the frequency of coughing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Bal&s;am of Copaiva is thought to promote urine more than the other native bal&s;ams; and common re&s;in is &s;aid to act as a power|ful diuretic in hor&s;es. The&s;e are al&s;o much recommended in gleets, and in fluor albus, perhaps more than they de&s;erve; they give a violet &s;mell to the urine, and hence probably increa&s;e the &s;ecretion of it.</P>
<P><PB N="704" REF="7110">
Calcined egg-&s;hells are &s;aid to promote urine, perhaps from the pho&s;phoric acid they contain.</P>
<P N="3">3. Cold air and cold water will increa&s;e the quantity of urine by decrea&s;ing the ab&s;orption from the bladder; and neutral and alcalious &s;alts and cantharides by &s;timulating the neck of the bladder to di&s;|charge the urine as &s;oon as &s;ecreted; and alcohol as gin and rum at the beginning of intoxication, if the body be kept cool, occa&s;ion much urine by inverting the urinary lymphatics, and thence pouring a fluid into the bladder, which never pa&s;&s;ed the kidnies. But it is probable, that tho&s;e medicines, which give a &s;cent to the urine, as the bal&s;ams and re&s;ins, but particularly a&s;paragus and garlic, are the only drugs, which truly increa&s;e the &s;ecretion of the kidnies. Alcohol however, u&s;ed as above mentioned, and perhaps great do&s;es of tincture of can|tharides, may be con&s;idered as dra&s;tic diuretics, as they pour a fluid into the bladder by the retrograde action of the lymphatics, which are in great abundance &s;pread about the neck of it. See Sect. XXIX. 3.</P>
<P N="5">V. Mild cathartics. The ancients believed that &s;ome purges eva|cuated the bile, and hence were termed Cholagogues; others the lymph, and were termed Hydragogues; and that in &s;hort each ca|thartic &s;elected a peculiar humour, which it di&s;charged. The mo|derns have too ha&s;tily rejected this &s;y&s;tem; the &s;ubject well de&s;erves further ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Calomel given in the do&s;e from ten to twenty grains, &s;o as to in|duce purging without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other drugs, appears to me to particularly increa&s;e the &s;ecretion of bile, and to evacuate it; aloe &s;eems to increa&s;e the &s;ecretion of the inte&s;tinal mucus; and it is probable that the pancreas and &s;pleen may be peculiarly &s;timulated into action by &s;ome other of this tribe of medicines; whil&s;t others of
<PB N="705" REF="7120">
them may &s;imply &s;timulate the inte&s;tinal canal to evacuate its con|tents, as the bile of animals. It mu&s;t be remarked, that all the&s;e cathartic medicines are &s;uppo&s;ed to be exhibited in their u&s;ual do&s;es, otherwi&s;e they become dra&s;tic purges, and are treated of in the Cla&s;s of Invertentia.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The mucus of the bladder is &s;een in the urine, when cantha|rides have been u&s;ed, either internally or externally, in &s;uch do&s;es as to induce the &s;trangury. Spirit of turpentine is &s;aid to have the &s;ame effect. I have given above a dram of it twice a day floating on a gla&s;s of water in chronic lumbago without this effect, and the patient gra|dually recovered.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Aloe given internally &s;eems to act chiefly on the rectum and &s;pincter ani, producing tene&s;mus and piles. Externally in cly&s;ters or &s;uppo&s;itories, common &s;alt &s;eems to act on that bowel with greater certainty. But where the thread-worm or a&s;carides exi&s;t, 60 or 100 grains of aloes reduced to powder and boiled in a pint of gruel, and u&s;ed as a cly&s;ter twice a week for three months, has frequently de|&s;troyed them.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The external application of cantharides by &s;timulating the excretory ducts of the capillary glands produces a great &s;ecretion of &s;ubcutaneous mucus with pain and inflammation; which mucaginous fluid, not being able to permeate the cuticle, rai&s;es it up; a &s;imilar &s;ecretion and elevation of the cuticle is produced by actual fire; and by cau&s;tic materials, as by the application of the juice of the root of white briony, or brui&s;ed mu&s;tard-&s;eed. Experiments are wanting to introduce &s;ome acrid application into practice in&s;tead of cantharides, which might not induce the &s;trangury.</P>
<P><PB N="706" REF="7130">
Mu&s;tard-&s;eed alone is too acrid, and if it be &s;uffered to lie on the &s;kin many minutes is liable to produce a &s;lough and con&s;equent ulcer, and &s;hould therefore be mixed with flour when applied to cold extre|mities. Volatile alkali properly diluted might &s;timulate the &s;kin with|out inducing &s;trangury.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The mild errhines are &s;uch as moderately &s;timulate the mem|brane of the no&s;trils, &s;o as to increa&s;e the &s;ecretion of na&s;al mucus; as is &s;een in tho&s;e, who are habituated to take &s;nuff. The &s;tronger errhines are mentioned in Art. V. 2. 3.</P>
<P N="10">X. The &s;ecretion of tears is increa&s;ed either by applying acrid &s;ub|&s;tances to the eye; or acrid vapours, which &s;timulate the excretory duct of the lacrymal gland; or by applying them to the no&s;trils, and &s;timulating the excretory duct of the lacrymal &s;ack, as treated of in the Section on In&s;tinct.</P>
<P>Or the &s;ecretion of tears is increa&s;ed by the a&s;&s;ociation of the mo|tions of the excretory duct of the lacrymal &s;ack with ideas of tender plea&s;ure, or of hopele&s;s di&s;tre&s;s, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 2. and 3.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The &s;ecretion of &s;en&s;orial power in the brain is probably in|crea&s;ed by opium or wine, becau&s;e when taken in certain quantity an immediate increa&s;e of &s;trength and activity &s;ucceeds for a time, with con&s;equent debility if the quantity taken be &s;o great as to intoxicate in the lea&s;t degree. The nece&s;&s;ity of perpetual re&s;piration &s;hews, that the oxygen of the atmo&s;phere &s;upplies the &s;ource of the &s;pirit of animation; which is con&s;tantly expended, and is probably too fine to be long contained in the nerves after its production in the brain. Whence it is probable, that the re&s;piration of oxygen
<PB N="707" REF="7140">
gas mixed with common air may increa&s;e the &s;ecretion of &s;en&s;orial power; as indeed would appear from its exhilarating effect on mo&s;t patients.</P>

<P N="1">I. THOSE THINGS which increa&s;e the irritative motions, which con&s;titute ab&s;orption, are termed &s;orbentia; and are as various as the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which they &s;timulate into action.</P>
<P N="1">1. Cutaneous ab&s;orption is increa&s;ed by au&s;tere acids, as of vitriol; hence they are believed to check colliquative &s;weats, and to check the eruption of &s;mall-pox, and contribute to the cure of the itch, and tinea; hence they thicken the &s;aliva in the mouth, as lemon-juice, crab-juice, &s;loes.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ab&s;orption from the mucous membrane is increa&s;ed by opium, and Peruvian bark, internally; and by blue vitriol externally. Hence the expectoration in coughs, and the mucous di&s;charge from the ure|thra, are thickened and le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P N="3">3. Ab&s;orption from the cellular membrane is promoted by bitter vegetables, and by emetics, and cathartics. Hence matter is thick|ened and le&s;&s;ened in ulcers by opium and Peruvian bark; and &s;erum is ab&s;orbed in ana&s;arca by the operation of emetics and cathartics.</P>
<P N="4">4. Venous ab&s;orption is increa&s;ed by acrid vegetables; as water|cre&s;s, cellery, hor&s;e-radi&s;h, mu&s;tard. Hence their u&s;e in &s;ea|&s;curvy, the vibices of which are owing to a defect of venous ab|&s;orption; and by external &s;timulants, as vinegar, and by electricity, and perhaps by oxygen.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="711" REF="7180">
5. Inte&s;tinal ab&s;orption is increa&s;ed by a&s;tringent vegetables, as rhubarb, galls; and by earthy &s;alts, as alum; and by argillaceous and calcareous earth.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hepatic ab&s;orption is increa&s;ed by metallic &s;alts, hence calo|mel and &s;al martis are &s;o efficacious in jaundice, worms, chloro&s;is, drop&s;y.</P>
<P N="7">7. Venereal virus in ulcers is ab&s;orbed by the &s;timulus of mercury; hence they heal by the u&s;e of this medicine.</P>
<P N="8">8. Vene&s;ection, hunger, thir&s;t, and violent evacuations, increa&s;e all ab&s;orptions; hence &s;weating produces co&s;tivene&s;s.</P>
<P N="9">9. Externally bitter a&s;tringent vegetables, earthy and metallic &s;alts, and bandages, promote the ab&s;orption of the parts on which they are applied.</P>
<P N="10">10. All the&s;e in their u&s;ual do&s;es do not increa&s;e the natural heat; but they induce co&s;tivene&s;s, and deep coloured urine with earthy &s;ediment.</P>
<P>In greater do&s;es they invert the motions of the &s;tomach and lacteals; and hence vomit or purge, as carduus benedictus, rhubarb. They promote per&s;piration, if the &s;kin be kept warm; as camomile tea, and te&s;taceous powders, have been u&s;ed as &s;udorifics.</P>
<P>The preparations of antimony vomit, purge, or &s;weat, either ac|cording to the quantity exhibited, or as a part of what is given is eva|cuated. Thus a quarter of a grain of emetic tartar (if well prepared) will promote a diaphore&s;is, if the &s;kin be kept warm; half a grain will procure a &s;tool or two fir&s;t, and &s;weating afterwards; and a grain will generally vomit, and then purge, and la&s;tly &s;weat the patient. In le&s;s quantity it is probable, that this medicine acts like other metallic

&s;alts, as &s;teel, zinc, or copper in &s;mall do&s;es; that is, that it &s;trengthens the &s;y&s;tem by its &s;timulus. As camomile or rhubarb in different do&s;es vomit, or purge, or act as &s;timulants &s;o as to &s;trengthen the &s;y&s;tem.</P>

<HEAD>II. OBSERVATIONS ON THE SORBENTIA.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. 1. As there is great difference in the apparent &s;t$ucture of the various glands, and of the fluids which they &s;elect from the blood, the&s;e glands mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s different kinds of irritability, and are there|fore &s;timulated into &s;tronger or unnatural actions by different articles of the materia medica, as &s;hewn in the &s;ecernentia. Now as the ab|&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els are likewi&s;e glands, and drink up or &s;elect different fluids, as chyle, water, mucus, with a part of every different &s;ecre|tion, as a part of the bile, a part of the &s;aliva, a part of the urine, &amp;c. it appears, that the&s;e ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s different kinds of irritability, and in con&s;equence mu&s;t require different articles of the materia medica to excite them into unu&s;ual action. This part of the &s;ubject has been &s;o little attended to, that the candid reader will find in this article a great deal to excu&s;e.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of the &s;ecernentia did in a le&s;s degree increa&s;e ab&s;orption, from the combination of different properties in the &s;ame vegetable body; for the &s;ame rea&s;on &s;ome of the cla&s;s of &s;or|bentia produce &s;ecretion in a le&s;s degree, as tho&s;e bitters which have al&s;o an aroma in their compo&s;ition; the&s;e are known from their in|crea&s;ing the heat of the &s;y&s;tem above its u&s;ual degree.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t al&s;o be noted, that the actions of every part of the ab&s;or|bent &s;y&s;tem are &s;o a&s;&s;ociated with each other, that the drugs which &s;timulate one branch increa&s;e the action of the whole; and the torpor or qui$&s;cence of one branch weakens the exertions of the whole; or
<PB N="713" REF="7200">
when one branch is excited into &s;tronger action, &s;ome other branch has its actions weakened or inverted. Yet though peculiar branches of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem are &s;timulated into action by peculiar &s;ub|&s;tances, there are other &s;ub&s;tances which &s;eem to &s;timulate the whole &s;y&s;tem, and that without immediately increa&s;ing any of the &s;ecretions; as tho&s;e bitters which po&s;&s;e&s;s no aromatic &s;cent, at the head of which &s;tands the famed Peruvian bark, or cinchona.</P>
<P N="2">2. Cutaneous ab&s;orption. I have heard of &s;ome experiments, in which the body was kept cold, and was thought to ab&s;orb more moi&s;|ture from the atmo&s;phere than at any other time. This however cannot be determined by &s;tatical experiments; as the capillary ve&s;&s;els, which &s;ecrete the per&s;pirable matter, mu&s;t at the &s;ame time have been benumbed by the cold; and from their inaction there could not have been the u&s;ual wa&s;te of the weight of the body; and as all other mu&s;|cular exertions are be&s;t performed, when the body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its u&s;ual degree of warmth, it is conclu&s;ive, that the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem &s;hould likewi&s;e do its office be&s;t, when it is not benumbed by external cold.</P>
<P>The au&s;tere acids, as of vitriol, lemon-juice, juice of crabs and &s;loes, &s;trengthen dige&s;tion, and prevent that propen&s;ity to &s;weat &s;o u&s;ual to weak convale&s;cents, and dimini&s;h the colliquative &s;weats in hectic fevers; all which are owing to their increa&s;ing the action of the external and internal cutaneous ab&s;orption. Hence vitriolic acid is given in the &s;mall-pox to prevent the too ha&s;ty or too copious erup|tion, which it effects, by increa&s;ing the cutaneous ab&s;orption. Vi|negar, from the quantity of alcohol which it contains, exerts a con|trary effect to that here de&s;cribed, and belongs to the incitantia; as an ounce of it promotes &s;weat, and a flu&s;hing of the &s;kin; at the &s;ame time externally it acts as a venous ab&s;orbent, as the lips become pale by moi&s;tening them with it. And it is &s;aid, when taken internally in
<PB N="714" REF="7210">
great and continued quantity, to induce palene&s;s of the &s;kin, and &s;oft|ne&s;s of the bones.</P>
<P>The &s;weet vegetable acids, as of &s;everal ripe fruits, are among the torpentia; as they are le&s;s &s;timulating than the general food of this climate, and are hence u&s;ed in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Where the quantity of fluids in the &s;y&s;tem is much le&s;&s;ened, as in hectic fever, which has been of &s;ome continuance, or in &s;purious pe|ripneumony, a grain of opium given at night will &s;ometimes prevent the appearance of &s;weats; which is owing to the &s;timulus of opium increa&s;ing the actions of the cutaneous ab&s;orbents, more than tho&s;e of the &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin. Whence the &s;ecretion of per&s;pirable matter is not decrea&s;ed, but its appearance on the &s;kin is prevented by its more facile ab&s;orption.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is one kind of itch, which &s;eldom appears between the fingers, is the lea&s;t infectious, and mo&s;t difficult to eradicate, and which has its cure much facilitated by the internal u&s;e of acid of vi|triol. This di&s;ea&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall ulcers in the &s;kin, which are healed by whatever increa&s;es the cutaneous ab&s;orption. The external application of &s;ulphur, mercury, and acrid vegetables, acts on the &s;ame principle; for the animalcula, which are &s;een in the&s;e pu&s;|tules, are the effect, not the cau&s;e, of them; as all other &s;tagnating animal fluids, as the &s;emen it&s;elf, abounds with &s;imilar micro&s;copic animals.</P>
<P N="4">4. Young children have &s;ometimes an eruption upon the head called Tinea, which di&s;charges an acrimonius ichor inflaming the parts, on which it falls. This eruption I have &s;een &s;ubmit to the internal u&s;e of vitriolic acid, when only wheat-flour was applied externally. This kind of eruption is likewi&s;e frequently cured by te&s;taceous powders; two materials &s;o widely different in their
<PB N="715" REF="7220">
chemical properties, but agreeing in their power of promoting cuta|neous ab&s;orption.</P>
<P N="2">II. Ab&s;orption from the mucous membrane is increa&s;ed by applying to its &s;urface the au&s;tere acids, as of vitriol, lemon-juice, crab-juice, &s;loes. When the&s;e are taken into the mouth, they immediately thicken, and at the &s;ame time le&s;&s;en the quantity of the &s;aliva; which la&s;t circum&s;tance cannot be owing to their coagulating the &s;aliva, but to their increa&s;ing the ab&s;orption of the thinner parts of it. So alum applied to the tip of the tongue does not &s;top in its action there, but independent of its diffu&s;ion it induces cohe&s;ion and corrugation over the whole mouth. (Cullen's Mat. Med. Art. A&s;tringentia.) Which is owing to the a&s;&s;ociation of the motions of the parts or branches of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem with each other.</P>
<P>Ab&s;orption from the mucous membrane is increa&s;ed by opium taken internally in &s;mall do&s;es more than by any other medicine, as is &s;een in its thickening the expectoration in coughs, and the di&s;charge from the no&s;trils in catarrh, and perhaps the di&s;charge from the urethra in gonorrhoea. The bark &s;eems next in power for all the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Externally &s;light &s;olutions of blue vitriol, as two or three grains to an ounce of water, applied to ulcers of the mouth, or to chancres on the glans penis, more powerfully induces them to heal than any other material.</P>
<P>Where the lungs or urethra are inflamed to a con&s;iderable de|gree, and the ab&s;orption is &s;o great, that the mucus is already too thick, and adheres to the membrane from its vi&s;cidity, opiates and bitter vegetable and au&s;tere acids are improper; and mucila|ginous diluents &s;hould be u&s;ed in their &s;tead with vene&s;ection and torpentia.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="716" REF="7230">
III. 1. Ab&s;orption from the cellular membrane, and from all the other cavities of the body, is too &s;lowly performed in &s;ome con&s;titu|tions; hence the bloated pale complexion; and when this occurs in its greate&s;t degree, it becomes an univer&s;al drop&s;y. The&s;e habits are liable to intermittent fevers, hy&s;teric paroxy&s;ms, cold extremities, indige&s;tion, and all the &s;ymptoms of debility.</P>
<P>The ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem is more &s;ubject to torpor or quie&s;cence than the &s;ecerning &s;y&s;tem, both from the coldne&s;s of the fluids which are applied to it, as the moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;phere, and from the cold|ne&s;s of the fluids which we drink; and al&s;o from its being &s;timulated only by intervals, as when we take our food; whereas the &s;ecerning &s;y&s;tem is perpetually excited into action by the warm circulating blood; as explained in Sect.

<P N="2">2. The Peruvian bark, camomile flowers, and other bitter drugs, by &s;timulating this cellular branch of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem prevents it from becoming quie&s;cent; hence the cold paroxy&s;ms of tho&s;e agues, which ari&s;e from the torpor of the cellular lymphatics, are prevented, and the hot fits in con&s;equence. The patient thence pre&s;erves his natural heat, regains his healthy colour, and his accu&s;tomed &s;trength.</P>
<P>Where the cold paroxy&s;m of an ague originates in the ab&s;orbents of the liver, &s;pleen, or other internal vi&s;cus, the addition of &s;teel to vegetable bitters, and e&s;pecially after the u&s;e of one do&s;e of calomel, much advances the cure.</P>
<P>And where it originates in any part of the &s;ecerning &s;y&s;tem, as is probably the ca&s;e in &s;ome kinds of agues, the addition of opium in the do&s;e of a grain and half, given about an hour before the acce&s;s of the paroxy&s;m, or mixed with chalybeate and bitter medicines, en&s;ures the cure. Or the &s;ame may be effected by wine given in&s;tead of opi|um before the paroxy&s;m, &s;o as nearly to intoxicate.</P>
<P><PB N="717" REF="7240">
The&s;e three kinds of agues are thus di&s;tingui&s;hed; the fir&s;t is not attended with any tumid or indurated vi&s;cus, which the people call an ague cake, and which is evident to the touch. The &s;econd is ac|companied with a tumid vi&s;cus; and the la&s;t has generally, I believe, the quartan type, and is attended with &s;ome degree of arterial debility.</P>
<P N="3">3. This cla&s;s of ab&s;orbent medicines are &s;aid to decrea&s;e irritability. After any part of our &s;y&s;tem has been torpid or quie&s;cent, by what|ever cau&s;e that was produced, it becomes afterwards capable of being excited into greater motion by &s;mall &s;timuli; hence the hot fit of fever &s;ucceeds the cold one. As the&s;e medicines prevent torpor or quie&s;cence of parts of the &s;y&s;tem, as cold hands or feet, which per|petually happen to weak con&s;titutions, the &s;ub&s;equent increa&s;e of irri|tability of the&s;e parts is likewi&s;e prevented.</P>
<P N="4">4. The&s;e ab&s;orbent medicines, including both the bitters, and me|tallic &s;alts, and opiates, are of great u&s;e in the drop&s;y by their pro|moting univer&s;al ab&s;orption; but here evacuations are likewi&s;e to be produced, as will be treated of in the Invertentia.</P>
<P N="5">5. The matter in ulcers is thickened, and thence rendered le&s;s corro&s;ive, the &s;aline part of it being reab&s;orbed by the u&s;e of bitter medicines; hence the bark is u&s;ed with advantage in the cure of ulcers.</P>
<P N="6">6. Bitter medicines &s;trengthen dige&s;tion by promoting the ab&s;orp|tion of chyle; hence the introduction of hop into the potation u&s;ed at our meals, which as a medicine may be taken advantageou&s;ly, but, like other unnece&s;&s;ary &s;timuli, mu&s;t be injurious as an article of our daily diet.</P>
<P><PB N="718" REF="7250">
The hop may perhaps in &s;ome degree contribute to the production of gravel in the kidnies, as our intemperate wine-drinkers are more &s;ubject to the gout, and ale-drinkers to the gravel; in the formation of both which di&s;ea&s;es, there can be no doubt, but that the alcohol is the principal, if not the only agent.</P>
<P N="7">7. Vomits greatly increa&s;e the ab&s;orption from the cellular mem|brane, as &s;quill, and foxglove. The &s;quill &s;hould be given in the do&s;e of a grain of the dried root every hour, till it operates upwards and downwards. Four ounces of the fre&s;h leaves of the foxglove &s;hould be boiled from two pounds of water to one, and half an ounce of the decoction taken every two hours for four or more do&s;es. This medicine by &s;timulating into inverted action the ab&s;orbents of the &s;to|mach, increa&s;es the direct action of the cellular lymphatics.</P>
<P>Another more convenient way of a&s;certaining the do&s;e of foxglove is by making a &s;aturated tincture of it in proof &s;pirit; which has the twofold advantage of being invariable in its original &s;trength, and of keeping a long time as a &s;hop-medicine without lo&s;ing any of its virtue. Put two ounces of the leaves of purple foxglove, digitalis purpurea, nicely dried, and coar&s;ely powdered, into a mixture of four ounces of rectified &s;pirit of wine and four ounces of water; let the mixture &s;tand by the fire-&s;ide twenty-four hours frequently &s;haking the bottle, and thus making a &s;aturated tincture of digitalis; which mu&s;t be poured from the &s;ediment or pa&s;&s;ed through filtering paper.</P>
<P>As the &s;ize of a drop is greater or le&s;s according to the &s;ize of the rim of the phial from which it is dropped, a part of this &s;aturated tinc|ture is then directed to be put into a two-ounce phial, for the purpo&s;e of a&s;certaining the &s;ize of the drop. Thirty drops of this tincture is directed to be put into an ounce of mint-water for a draught to be taken twice or thrice a day, till it reduces the ana&s;arca of the limbs,
<PB N="719" REF="7260">
or removes the difficulty of breathing in hydrothorax, or till it in|duces &s;ickne&s;s. And if the&s;e do not occur in two or three days, the do&s;e mu&s;t be gradually increa&s;ed to forty or &s;ixty drops, or further.</P>
<P>From the great &s;timulus of this medicine the &s;tomach is rendered torpid with con&s;equent &s;ickne&s;s, which continues many hours and even days, owing to the great exhau&s;tion of its &s;en&s;orial power of ir|ritation; and the action of the heart and arteries becomes feeble from the deficient excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation; and la&s;tly, the ab&s;orbents of the cellular membrane act more violently in con&s;equence of the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation in the torpid heart and arteries, as explained in Suppl. I. 12.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance curiou&s;ly &s;imilar to this occurs to &s;ome people on &s;moking tobacco for a &s;hort time, who have not been accu&s;tomed to it. A degree of &s;ickne&s;s is pre&s;ently induced, and the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries become feeble for a &s;hort time, as in the ap|proach to fainting, owing to the direct &s;ympathy between the&s;e and the &s;tomach, that is from defect of the excitement of the power of a&s;&s;ociation. Then there &s;ucceeds a tingling, and heat, and &s;ometimes &s;weat, owing to the increa&s;ed action of the capillaries, or per&s;pirative and mucous glands; which is occa&s;ioned by the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation by the weaker action of the heart and arteries, which now increa&s;es the action of the capillaries.</P>
<P N="8">8. Another method of increa&s;ing ab&s;orption from the cellular membrane is by warm air, or by warm &s;team. If the &s;welled legs of a drop&s;ical patient are inclo&s;ed in a box, the air of which is made warm by a lamp or two, copious &s;weats are &s;oon produced by the in|crea&s;ed action of the capillary glands, which are &s;een to &s;tand on the &s;kin, as it cannot readily exhale in &s;o &s;mall a quantity of air, which is only changed &s;o fa&s;t as may be nece&s;&s;ary to permit the lamps to burn. At the &s;ame time the lymphatics of the cellular membrane are
<PB N="720" REF="7270">
&s;timulated by the heat into greater action, as appears by the &s;peedy reduction of the tumid legs.</P>
<P>It would be well worth trying an experiment upon a per&s;on labour|ing under a general ana&s;arca by putting him into a room filled with air heated to 120 or 130 degrees, which would probably excite a great general diaphore&s;is, and a general cellular ab&s;orption both from the lungs and every other part. And that air of &s;o great heat may be borne for many minutes without great inconvenience was &s;hewn by the experiments made in heated rooms by Dr. Fordyce and others. Philo&s;. Tran&s;.</P>
<P>Another experiment of u&s;ing warmth in ana&s;arca, or in other di&s;|ea&s;es, might be by immer&s;ing the patient in warm air, or in warm &s;team, received into an oil-&s;kin bag, or bathing-tub of tin, &s;o ma|naged, that the current of warm air or &s;team &s;hould pa&s;s round and cover the whole of the body except the head, which might not be expo&s;ed to it; and thus the ab&s;orbents of the lungs might be induced to act more powerfully by &s;ympathy with the &s;kin, and not by the &s;timulus of heat. See U&s;es of Warm Bath, Cla&s;s IV. 2. 2. 1.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. Venous ab&s;orption. Cellary, water-cre&s;&s;es, cabbages, and many other vegetables of the Cla&s;s Tetradynamia, do not increa&s;e the heat of the body (except tho&s;e who&s;e acrimony approaches to cor|ro&s;ion), and hence they &s;eem alone, or principally, to act on the ve|nous &s;y&s;tem; the extremities of which we have &s;hewn are ab&s;orbents of the red blood, after it has pa&s;&s;ed the capillaries and glands.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the &s;ea-&s;curvy and petechial fever the veins do not perfectly perform this office of ab&s;orption; and hence the vibices are occa&s;ioned by blood &s;tagnating at their extremities, or extrava&s;ated into the cel|lular membrane. And this cla&s;s of vegetables, &s;timulating the veins to perform their natural ab&s;orption, without increa&s;ing the energy of
<PB N="721" REF="7280">
the arterial action, prevents future petechiae, and may a&s;&s;i&s;t the ab|&s;orption of the blood already &s;tagnated, as &s;oon as its chemical change renders it proper for that operation.</P>
<P N="3">3. The fluids, which a$e extrava&s;ated, and received into the cells of the cellular membrane, &s;eem to continue there for many days, &s;o as to undergo &s;ome chemical change, and are then taken up again by the mouths of the cellular ab&s;orbents. But the new ve&s;&s;els produced in inflamed parts, as they communicate with the veins, are probably ab&s;orbed again by the veins along with the blood which they contain in their cavities. Hence the blood, which is extrava&s;ated in brui&s;es or vibices, is gradually many days in di&s;appearing; but after due eva|cuations the inflamed ve&s;&s;els on the white of the eye, if any &s;timu|lant lotion is applied, totally di&s;appear in a few hours.</P>
<P>Among&s;t ab&s;orbents affecting the veins we &s;hould therefore add the external application of &s;timulant materials; as of vinegar, which makes the lips pale on touching them. Friction, and electricity.</P>
<P N="4">4. Haemorrhages are of two kinds, either arterial, which are at|tended with inflammation; or venous, from a deficiency in $$e ab|&s;orbent power of this &s;et of ve&s;&s;els. In the former ca&s;e the t$ pentia are efficacious; in the latter &s;teel, opium, alum, and all the tribe of &s;orbentia, are u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. Sydenham recommends vegetables of the cla&s;s Tetradynamia in rheumatic pains left after the cure of intermittents. The&s;e pains are perhaps &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the &s;ea-&s;curvy, and &s;eem to ari&s;e from want of ab&s;orption in the affected part, and hence are relieved by the &s;ame medicines.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="722" REF="7290">
V. 1. Inte&s;tinal ab&s;orption. Some a&s;tringent vegetables, as rhu|barb, may be given in &s;uch do&s;es as to prove cathartic; and, after a part of it is evacuated from the body, the remaining part augments the ab&s;orption of the inte&s;tines; and acts, as if a &s;imilar do&s;e had been exhibited after the operation of any other purgative. Hence 4 grains of rhubarb &s;trengthen the bowels, 30 grains fir&s;t empty them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The earthy &s;alts, as alum, increa&s;e the inte&s;tinal ab&s;orption, and hence induce con&s;tipation in their u&s;ual do&s;e; alum is &s;aid &s;ometimes to cure intermittents, perhaps when their &s;eat is in the inte&s;tines, when other remedies have failed. It is u&s;eful in the diabaetes by exciting the ab&s;orbents of the bladder into their natural action; and combined with re&s;in is e&s;teemed in the fluor albus, and in gleets. Lime-&s;tone or chalk, and probably gyp&s;um, po&s;&s;e&s;s effects in &s;ome degree &s;imilar, and increa&s;e the ab&s;orption of the inte&s;tines; and thus in certain do&s;es re&s;train &s;ome diarrhoeas, but in greater do&s;es alum I &s;uppo&s;e will act as a cathartic. Five or ten grains produce con&s;tipation, 20 or 30 grains are either emetic or cathartic.</P>
<P N="3">3. Earth of alum, tobacco-pipe clay, marl, Armenian bole, lime, crab's eyes or claws, and calcined hart&s;horn, or bone a&s;hes, re&s;train fluxes; either mechanically by &s;upplying &s;omething like mucilage, or oil, or rollers to abate the friction of the aliment over inflamed mem|branes; or by increa&s;ing their ab&s;orption. The two la&s;t con&s;i&s;t of calcareous earth united to pho&s;phoric acid, and the Armenian bole and marl may contain iron. By the con&s;ent between the inte&s;tines and the &s;kin 20 grains of Armenian bole given at going into bed to hectic patients will frequently check their tendency to &s;weat as well as to purge, and the more certainly if joined with one grain of opium.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="723" REF="7300">
VI. 1. Ab&s;orption from the liver, &s;tomach, and other vi&s;cera. When inflammations of the liver are &s;ubdued to a certain degree by vene&s;ection, with calomel and other gentle purges, &s;o that the arte|rial energy becomes weakened, four or eight grains of iron-filings, or of &s;alt of &s;teel, with the Peruvian bark, have wonderful effect in curing the cough, and re&s;toring the liver to its u&s;ual &s;ize and &s;anity; which it &s;eems to effect by increa&s;ing the ab&s;orption of this vi&s;cus. The &s;ame I &s;uppo&s;e happens in re&s;pect to the tumours of other vi&s;|cera, as of the &s;pleen, or pancreas, &s;ome of which are frequently en|larged in agues.</P>
<P N="2">2. Haemorrhages from the no&s;e, rectum, kidnies, uterus, and other parts, are frequently attendant on di&s;ea&s;ed livers; the blood being impeded in the vena portarum from the decrea&s;ed power of ab|&s;orption, and in con&s;equence of the increa&s;ed &s;ize of this vi&s;cus. The&s;e haemorrhages after vene&s;ection, and a mercurial cathartic, are mo&s;t certainly re&s;trained by &s;teel alone, or joined with an opiate; which increa&s;e the ab&s;orption, and dimini&s;h the &s;ize of the liver.</P>
<P>Chalybeates may al&s;o re&s;train the&s;e haemorrhages by their promoting venous ab&s;orption, though they exert their principal effect upon the liver. Hence al&s;o opiates, and bitters, and vitriolic acid, are advan|tageou&s;ly u&s;ed along with them. It mu&s;t be added that &s;ome haemor|rhages recur by periods like the paroxy&s;ms of intermittent fevers, and are thence cured by the &s;ame treatment.</P>
<P N="3">3. The jaundice is frequently cau&s;ed by the in&s;ipidity of the bile, which does not &s;timulate the gall-bladder and bile-ducts into their due action; hence it &s;tagnates in the gall-bladder, and produces a kind of cry&s;tallization, which is too large to pa&s;s into the inte&s;tines, blocks up the bile-duct, and occa&s;ions a long and painful di&s;ea&s;e. A para|ly&s;is of the bile-duct produces a &s;imilar jaundice, but without pain.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="724" REF="7310">
4. Worms in &s;heep called flukes are owing to the dilute &s;tate of the bile; hence they originate in the inte&s;tines, and thence migrate into the biliary ducts, and corroding the liver produce ulcers, cough, and hectic fever, called the rot. In human bodies it is probable the inert &s;tate of the bile is one cau&s;e of the production of worms; which in&s;ipid &s;tate of the bile is owing to deficient ab&s;orption of the thinner parts of it; hence the pale and bloated complexion, and &s;welled up|per lip, of wormy children, is owing to the concomitant deficiency of ab&s;orption from the cellular membrane. Salt of &s;teel, or the ru&s;t of it, or filings of it, with bitters, increa&s;e the acrimony of the bile by promoting the ab&s;orption of its aqueous part; and hence de&s;troy worms, as well as by their immediate action on the inte&s;tines, or on the worms them&s;elves. The cure is facilitated by premi&s;ing a purge with calomel. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 3. 9.</P>
<P N="5">5. The chloro&s;is is another di&s;ea&s;e owing to the deficient action of the ab&s;orbents of the liver, and perhaps in &s;ome degree al&s;o to that of the &s;ecretory ve&s;&s;els, or glands, which compo&s;e that vi&s;cus. Of this the want of the catameniae, which is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be a cau&s;e, is only a &s;ymptom or con&s;equence. In this complaint the bile is deficient perhaps in quantity, but certainly in acrimony, the thin|ner parts not being ab&s;orbed from it. Now as the bile is probably of great con&s;equence in the proce&s;s of making the blood; it is on this account that the blood is &s;o de&s;titute of red globules; which is evinced by the great palene&s;s of the&s;e patients. As this &s;erous blood mu&s;t exert le&s;s &s;timulus on the heart, and arteries, the pul&s;e in con&s;equence becomes quick as well as weak, as explained in Sect. XII. 1. 4.</P>
<P>The quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e is frequently &s;o great and permanent, that when attended by an accidental cough, the di&s;ea&s;e may be mi&s;|taken for hectic fever; but is cured by chalybeates, and bitters ex|hibited twice a day; with half a grain of opium, and a grain of aloe
<PB N="725" REF="7320">
every night; and the expected catamenia appears in con&s;equence of a re&s;toration of the due quantity of red blood. This and the two former articles approach to the di&s;ea&s;e termed paraly&s;is of the liver. Sect. XXX. 4.</P>
<P N="6">6. It &s;eems paradoxical, that the &s;ame treatment with chalybeates, bitters, and opiates, which produces men&s;truation in chlorotic pa|tients, &s;hould repre&s;s the too great or permanent men&s;truation, which occurs in weak con&s;titutions at the time of life when it &s;hould cea&s;e. This complaint is an haemorrhage owing to the debility of the ab|&s;orbent power of the veins, and belongs to the paragraph on venous ab&s;orption above de&s;cribed, and is thence curable by chalybeates, alum, bitters, and particularly by the exhibition of a grain of opium every night with five grains of rhubarb.</P>
<P N="7">7. Metallic &s;alts &s;upply us with very powerful remedies for pro|moting ab&s;orption in drop&s;ical ca&s;es; which frequently are cau&s;ed by enlargement of the liver. Fir&s;t, as they may be given in &s;uch quan|tities as to prove &s;trongly cathartic, of which more will be &s;aid in the article on invertentia; and then, when their purgative quality cea&s;es, like the effect of rhubarb, their ab&s;orbent quality continues to act. The &s;alts of mercury, &s;ilver, copper, i$on, zinc, antimony, have all been u&s;ed in the drop&s;y; either &s;ingly for the former purpo&s;e, or united with bitters for the latter, and occa&s;ionally with moderate but repeated opiates.</P>
<P N="8">8. From a quarter of a grain to half a grain of blue vitriol given every four or &s;ix hours, is &s;aid to be very efficacious in ob&s;tinate inter|mittents; which al&s;o frequently ari&s;e from an enlarged vi&s;cus, as the liver or &s;pleen, and are thence owing to the deficient ab&s;orption of the lymphatics of that vi&s;cus. A quarter of a grain of white ar&s;enic, as I was informed by a &s;urgeon of the army, cures a quartan ague with
<PB N="726" REF="7330">
great certainty, if it be given an hour before the expected fit. This do&s;e he &s;aid was for a robu&s;t man, perhaps one eighth of a grain might be given and repeated with greater &s;afety and equal efficacy.</P>
<P>Dr. Fowler has given many &s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es in his treati&s;e on this &s;ubject. He prepares it by boiling &s;ixty-four grains of white ar&s;enic in a Florence fla&s;k along with as much pure vegetable fixed alcali in a pint of di&s;tilled water, till it is di&s;&s;olved, and then adding to it as much di&s;tilled water as will make the whole exactly &s;ixteen ounces. Hence there are four grains of ar&s;enic in every ounce of the &s;olution. This &s;hould be put into a phial of &s;uch a &s;ize of the edge of its aper|ture, that &s;ixty drops may weigh one dram, which will contain half a grain of ar&s;enic. To children from two years old to four he gives from two to five drops three or four times a day. From five years old to &s;even, he directs &s;even or eight drops. From eight years old to twelve, he directs from &s;even to ten drops. From thirteen years old to eighteen he directs from ten to twelve drops. From eighteen upwards, twelve drops. In &s;o powerful a medicine it is always prudent to begin with &s;maller do&s;es, and gradually to increa&s;e them.</P>
<P>A &s;aturated &s;olution of ar&s;enic in water is preferable I think to the above opero&s;e preparation of it; as no error can happen in weighing the ingredients, and it more certainly therefore po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an uniform &s;trength. Put much more white ar&s;enic reduced to powder into a given quantity of di&s;tilled water, than can be di&s;&s;olved in it. Boil it for half an hour in a Florence fla&s;k, or in a tin &s;auce-pan; let it &s;tand to &s;ub&s;ide, and filter it through paper. My friend Mr. Greene, a &s;urgeon at Brewood in Stafford&s;hire, a&s;&s;ured me, that he had cured in one &s;ea&s;on agues without number with this &s;aturated &s;olution; that he found ten drops from a two-ounce phial given thrice a day was a full do&s;e for a grown per&s;on, but that he generally began with five.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="727" REF="7340">
9. The manner, in which ar&s;enic acts in curing intermittent fevers, cannot be by its general &s;timulus, becau&s;e no intoxication or heat follows the u&s;e of it; nor by its peculiar &s;timulus on any part of the &s;ecreting &s;y&s;tem, &s;ince it is not in &s;mall do&s;es &s;ucceeded by any increa&s;ed evacuation, or heat, and mu&s;t therefore exert its power, like other articles of the &s;orbentia, on the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem. In what manner it de&s;troys life &s;o &s;uddenly is difficult to under&s;tand, as it does not intoxicate like many vegetable poi&s;ons, nor produce fevers like contagious matter. When applied externally it &s;eems chemically to de&s;troy the part like other cau&s;tics. Does it chemically de&s;troy the &s;tomach, and life in con&s;equence? or does it de&s;troy the action of the &s;tomach by its great &s;timulus, and life in con&s;equence of the &s;ympathy between the &s;tomach and the heart? This la&s;t appears to be the mo&s;t probable mode of its operation.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of ar&s;enic in the cure of intermittent fevers I &s;u&s;pect to depend on its &s;timulating the &s;tomach into &s;tronger action, and thus, by the a&s;&s;ociation of this vi&s;cus with the heart and arteries, pre|venting the torpor of any part of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem. I was led to this conclu&s;ion from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The effects of ar&s;enic given a long time internally in &s;mall do&s;es, or when u&s;ed in larger quantities externally, &s;eem to be &s;imilar to tho&s;e of other great &s;timuli, as of wine or alcohol. The&s;e are a bloated countenance, &s;welled legs, hepatic tumours, and drop&s;y, and &s;ometimes eruptions on the &s;kin. The former of the&s;e I have &s;een, where ar&s;enic has been u&s;ed externally for curing the itch; and the latter appears on evidence in the famous trial of Mi&s;s Blandy at Chelm&s;|ford, about forty years ago.</P>
<P>Secondly. I &s;aw an ague cured by ar&s;enic in a child, who had in vain previou&s;ly taken a very large quantity of bark with great regu|larity. And another ca&s;e of a young officer, who had lived intem|perately, and laboured under an intermittent fever, and had taken the bark repeatedly in con&s;iderable quantities, with a grain of opium at
<PB N="728" REF="7350">
night, and though the paroxy&s;ms had been thrice thus for a time prevented, they recurred in about a week. On taking five drops of a &s;aturated &s;olution of ar&s;enic thrice a day the paroxy&s;ms cea&s;ed, and re|turned no more, and at the &s;ame time his appetite became much im|proved.</P>
<P>Thirdly. A gentleman about 65 years of age had for about ten years been &s;ubject to an intermittent pul&s;e, and to frequent palpita|tions of his heart. Lately the palpitations &s;eemed to ob&s;erve irregular periods, but the intermi&s;&s;ion of every third or fourth pul&s;ation was almo&s;t perpetual. On giving him four drops of a &s;aturated &s;olution of ar&s;enic from a two-ounce phial about every four hours for one day, not only the palpitation did not return, but the intermi&s;&s;ion cea&s;ed entirely, and did not return &s;o long as he took the medicine, whic$ was three or four days.</P>
<P>Now as when the &s;tomach has its action much weakened by an over-do&s;e of digitalis, the pul&s;e is liable to intermit, this evinces a direct &s;ympathy between the&s;e parts of the &s;y&s;tem, and as I have re|peatedly ob&s;erved, that when the pul&s;e begins to intermit in elderly people, that an eructation from the &s;tomach, voluntarily produced, will prevent the threatened &s;top of the heart; I am induced to think, that the torpid &s;tate of the &s;tomach, at the in&s;tant of the production of air occa&s;ioned by its weak action, cau&s;ed the intermi&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;e. And that ar&s;enic in this ca&s;e, as well as in the ca&s;es of agues above mentioned, produced its effects by &s;timulating the &s;tomach into more powerful action; and that the equality of the motions of the heart was thus re&s;tored by increa&s;ing the excitement of the &s;en&s;orial power of a&s;&s;ociation. See Sect. XXV. 17. Cla&s;s IV. 2. 1. 18.</P>
<P N="10">10. Where ar&s;enic has been given as a poi&s;on, it may be di&s;covered in the contents of the &s;tomach by the &s;mell like garlic, when a few grains of it are thrown on a red-hot iron. 2. If a few grains are placed between two plates of copper, and &s;ubjected to a red heat,
<PB N="729" REF="7360">
the copper becomes whitened. 3. Di&s;&s;olve ar&s;enic in water along with vegetable alcali, add to this a &s;olution of blue vitriol in water, and the mixture becomes of a fine green, which gradually precipitates, as di&s;covered by Bergman. 4. Where the quantity is &s;ufficient, &s;ome wheat may be &s;teeped in a &s;olution of it, which given to &s;par|rows or chickens will de&s;troy them.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Ab&s;orption of the matter from venereal ulcers. No ulcer can heal, unle&s;s the ab&s;orption from it is as great as the depo&s;ition in it. The preparations or oxydes of mercury in the cure of the venereal di&s;ea&s;e &s;eem to act by their increa&s;ing the ab&s;orption of the matter in the ulcers it occa&s;ions; and that whether they are taken into the &s;tomach, or applied on the &s;kin, or on the &s;urface of the ulcers. And this in the &s;ame manner as &s;ugar of lead, or other metallic oxydes, promote &s;o rapidly the healing of other ulcers by their external application; and probably when taken internally, as ru&s;t of iron given to children affected with &s;crophulous ulcers contributes to heal them, and &s;olu|tions of lead were once famous in phthi&s;is.</P>
<P>The matter depo&s;ited in large ab&s;ce&s;&s;es does not occa&s;ion hectic fe|ver, till it has become oxygenated by being expo&s;ed to the open air, or to the air through a moi&s;t membrane; the &s;ame &s;eems to happen to other kinds of matter, which produce fever, or which occa&s;ion &s;preading ulcers, and are thence termed contagious. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 3. II. 1. 5. II. 1. 6. 6. This may perhaps occur from the&s;e mat|ters not being generally ab&s;orbed, till they become oxygenated; and that it is the &s;timulus of the acid thus formed by their union with oxygen, which occa&s;ions their ab&s;orption into the circulation, and the fever, which they then produce. For though collections of mat|ter, and milk, and mucus, are &s;ometimes &s;uddenly ab&s;orbed during the action of emetics or in &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s, they are probably eliminated from the body without entering the circulation; that is, they are
<PB N="730" REF="7370">
taken up by the increa&s;ed action of one lymphatic branch, and eva|cuated by the inverted action of &s;ome other lymphatic branch, and thus carried off by &s;tool or urine.</P>
<P>But as the matter in large ab&s;ce&s;&s;es is in general not ab&s;orbed, till it becomes by &s;ome means expo&s;ed to air, there is rea&s;on to conclude, that the &s;timulus of this new combination of the matter with oxygen occa&s;ions its ab&s;orption; and that hence the ab&s;orption of matter in ulcers of all kinds, is &s;till more powerfully effected by the external application or internal u&s;e of metallic oxydes; which are al&s;o acids con&s;i&s;ting of the metal united with oxygen; and la&s;tly, becau&s;e ve|nereal ulcers, and tho&s;e of itch, and tinea, will not heal without &s;ome &s;timulant application; that is, the &s;ecretion of matter in them continues to be greater, than the ab&s;orption of it; and the ulcers at the &s;ame time continue to enlarge, by the contagion affecting the edges of them; that is, by the &s;timulus of the oxygenated matter &s;timulating the capillary ve&s;&s;els in its vicinity into actions &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the ulcer, which produces it.</P>
<P>This effect of the oxydes of mercury occurs, whether &s;alivation at|tends its u&s;e or not. Salivation is much forwarded by external warmth, when mercury is given to promote this &s;ecretion; but as the cure of venereal complaints depends on its ab&s;orbent quality, the act of &s;alivation is not nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful. A quarter of a grain of good corro&s;ive &s;ublimate twice a day will &s;eldom fail of curing the mo&s;t confirmed pox; and will as &s;eldom &s;alivate, if the patient be kept cool. A quarter of a grain thrice a day I believe to be infallible, if it be good &s;ublimate.</P>
<P>Mercury alone when &s;wallowed does not act beyond the inte&s;tines, its active preparations are the &s;alts formed by its union with the va|rious acids, as mentioned in the catalogue. Its union with the ve|getable acid, when triturated with manna, is &s;aid to compo&s;e Key&s;er's Pill. Triturated with gum arabic it is much recommended by Plenk; and triturated with &s;ugar and a little e&s;&s;ential oil, as directed in a
<PB N="731" REF="7380">
former Edinburgh Di&s;pen&s;atory, it probably forms &s;ome of the &s;yrups &s;old as no&s;trums.</P>
<P>United with &s;ulphur it &s;eldom enters the circulation, as when cin|nabar, or Aethiop's mineral, are taken inwardly. But united with fat and rubbed on the &s;kin, it is readily ab&s;orbed. I know not whe|ther it can be united to charcoal, nor whether it has been given in|ternally when united with animal fat.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. 1. Ab&s;orptions in general are increa&s;ed by inanition; hence the u&s;e of evacuations in the cure of ulcers. Dr. Jurin ab&s;orbed in one night, after a day's ab&s;tinence and exerci&s;e, eighteen ounces from the atmo&s;phere in his chamber; and every one mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, how &s;oon his &s;heets became dry, after having been moi&s;tened by &s;weat, if he throws off part of the bed-clothes to cool him&s;elf; which is owing to the increa&s;ed cutaneous ab&s;orption after the evacuation by previous &s;weat.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now as opium is an univer&s;al &s;timulant, as explained in the article on Incitantia, it mu&s;t &s;timulate into increa&s;ed action both the &s;ecretory &s;y&s;tem, and the ab&s;orbent one; but after repeated evacua|tion by vene&s;ection, and cathartics, the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem is already inclined to act more powerfully; as the blood-ve&s;&s;els being le&s;s di&s;|tended, there is le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance to the progre&s;s of the ab&s;orbed fluids into them. Hence after evacuations opium promotes ab&s;orption, if given in &s;mall do&s;es, much more than it promotes &s;ecretion; and is thus eminently of &s;ervice at the end of inflammations, as in pleuri&s;y, or peripneumony, in the do&s;e of four or five drops of the tincture$ given before the acce&s;s of the evening paroxy&s;m; which I have &s;een &s;ucceed even when the ri&s;us &s;ardonicus has exi&s;ted. Some convul|&s;ions may originate in the want of the ab&s;orption of &s;ome acrid
<PB N="732" REF="7390">
&s;ecretion, which occa&s;ions pain; hence the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are &s;o much more certainly relieved by opium after vene&s;ection or other eva|cuations.</P>
<P N="9">IX. 1. Ab&s;orption is increa&s;ed by the calces or &s;olutions of mer|cury, lead, zinc, copper, iron, externally applied; and by ar&s;enic, and by &s;ulphur, and by the application of bitter vegetables in fine powder. Thus an ointment con&s;i&s;ting of mercury and hog's fat rub|bed on the &s;kin cures venereal ulcers; and many kinds of herpetic eruptions are removed by an ointment con&s;i&s;ting of 60 grains of white precipitate of mercury and an ounce of hog's fat.</P>
<P N="2">2. The tumours about the necks of young people are often pro|duced by the ab&s;orption of a &s;aline or acrid material, which has been depo&s;ited from eruptions behind the ears, owing to deficient ab&s;orp|tion in the &s;urface of the ulcer, but which on running down on the &s;kin below becomes ab&s;orbed, and &s;wells the lymphatic glands of the neck; as the variolous matter, when in&s;erted into the arm, &s;wells the gland of the axilla. Sometimes the per&s;pirative matter produced behind the ears becomes putrid from the want of daily wa&s;hing them, and may al&s;o cau&s;e by its ab&s;orption the tumours of the lymphatics of the neck. In the former ca&s;e the application of a cerate of lapis ca|laminaris, or of ceru&s;&s;a applied in dry powder, or of rags dipped in a &s;olution of &s;ugar of lead, increa&s;es the ab&s;orption in the ulcers, and prevents the effu&s;ion of the &s;aline part of the &s;ecreted material. The latter is to be prevented by cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>After the eruptions or ulcers are healed a &s;olution of corro&s;ive &s;ubli|mate of one grain to an ounce of water applied for &s;ome weeks behind the ear, and among&s;t the roots of the hair on one &s;ide of the head, where the mouths of the lymphatics of the neck open them&s;elves, frequently removes the&s;e tumours.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="733" REF="7400">
3. Linen rags moi&s;tened with a &s;olution of half an ounce of &s;ugar of lead to a pint of water applied on the ery&s;ipelas on ana&s;arcous legs, which have a tendency to mortification, is more efficacious than other applications. White vitriol &s;ix grains di&s;&s;olved in one ounce of ro&s;e-water removes inflammations of the eyes after evacuation more certainly than &s;olutions of lead. Blue vitriol two or three grains di&s;|&s;olved in an ounce of water cures ulcers in the mouth, and other mucous membranes, and a &s;olution of ar&s;enic externally applied cures the itch, but requires great caution in the u&s;e of it. See Cla&s;s II. 1. 5. 6.</P>
<P N="4">4. Bitter vegetables, as the Peruvian bark, quilted between two &s;hirts, or &s;trewed in their beds, will cure the ague in children &s;ome|times. Iron in &s;olution, and &s;ome bitter extract, as in the form of ink, will cure one kind of herpes called the ringworm. And I have &s;een &s;even parts of bark in fine powder mixed with one part of ceru&s;s, or white lead, in fine powder, applied dry to &s;crophulous ulcers, and renewed daily, with great advantage.</P>
<P N="5">5. To the&s;e &s;hould be added electric &s;parks and &s;hocks, which promote the ab&s;orption of the ve&s;&s;els in inflamed eyes of &s;crophulous children; and di&s;per&s;e, or bring to &s;uppuration, &s;crophulous tumours about the neck. For this la&s;t purpo&s;e &s;mart &s;hocks &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed through the tumours only, by inclo&s;ing them between two bra&s;s knobs communicating with the external and internal coating of a charged phial. See Art. II. 2. 2. 2.</P>
<P N="10">X. 1. Bandages increa&s;e ab&s;orption, if they are made to fit nicely on the part; for which purpo&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pread &s;ome mode|rately adhe&s;ive pla&s;ter on the bandage, and to cut it into tails, or into &s;hreds two inches wide; the ends are to be wrapped over each other; and it mu&s;t be applied when the part is lea&s;t tumid, as in the morning
<PB N="734" REF="7410">
before the patient ri&s;es, if on the lower extremities. The em|pla&s;trum de minio made to cover the whole of a &s;welled leg in this manner, whether the &s;welling is hard, which is u&s;ually termed &s;cor butic; or more ea&s;ily compre&s;&s;ible, as in ana&s;arca, reduces the limb in two or three days to its natural &s;ize; for this purpo&s;e I have &s;ome|times u&s;ed carpenter's glue, mixed with one twentieth part of honey to prevent its becoming too hard, in&s;tead of a re&s;inous pla&s;ter; but the minium pla&s;ter of the &s;hops is in general to be preferred. No|thing &s;o much facilitates the cure of ulcers in the legs, as covering the whole limb from the toes to the knee with &s;uch a pla&s;ter|bandage; which increa&s;es the power of ab&s;orption in the &s;urface of the &s;ore.</P>
<P N="2">2. The lymph is carried along the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, which are replete with valves, by the intermitted pre&s;&s;ure of the arteries in their neighbourhood. Now if the external &s;kin of the limb be lax, it ri&s;es, and gives way to the pre&s;&s;ure of the arteries at every pul&s;ation; and thence the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els are &s;ubject to the pre&s;&s;ure of but half the arterial force. But when the external &s;kin is tightened by the &s;ur|rounding bandage, and thence is not elevated by the arterial dia&s;tole, the whole of this power is exerted in compre&s;&s;ing the lymphatic ve&s;|&s;els, and carrying on the lymph already ab&s;orbed; and thence the ab|&s;orbent power is &s;o amazingly increa&s;ed by bandage nicely applied. Pains are &s;ometimes left in the fle&s;hy parts of the thighs or arms, after the inflammation is gone, in the acute rheumati&s;m, or after the patient is too weak for further evacuation; in this ca&s;e after internal ab&s;orbent medicines, as the bark, and opiates, have been u&s;ed in vain, I have &s;ucce&s;sfully applied a pla&s;ter-bandage, as above de&s;cribed, &s;o as to compre&s;s the pained part.</P>
<P N="11">XI. 1. We &s;hall conclude by ob&s;erving, that the &s;orbentia &s;trengthen the whole habit by preventing the e&s;cape of the fluid part
<PB N="735" REF="7420">
of the &s;ecretions out of the body, before it has given up as much nouri&s;hment, as it is capable; as the liquid part of the &s;ecretion of urine, &s;weat, &s;aliva, and of all other &s;ecretions, which are poured into receptacles. Hence they have been &s;aid to brace the body, and been called tonics, which are mechanical terms not applicable to the living bodies of animals; as explained in Sect. XXXII. 3. 2.</P>
<P N="2">2. A continued u&s;e of bitter medicines for years together, as of Portland's powder, or of the bark, is &s;uppo&s;ed to induce apoplexy, or other fatal di&s;ea&s;es. Two ca&s;es of this kind have fallen under my ob&s;ervation; the patients were both rather intemperate in re&s;pect to the u&s;e of fermented liquors, and one of them had been previou&s;ly &s;ubject to the gout. As I believe the gout generally originates from a torpor of the liver, which in&s;tead of being &s;ucceeded by an inflam|mation of it, is &s;ucceeded by an inflammation of &s;ome of the joints; or by a pimpled face, which is another mode, by which the di&s;ea&s;e of the liver is terminated. I conceive, that the daily u&s;e of bitter me|dicine had in the&s;e patients prevented the removal of a gouty inflam|mation from the liver to the membranes of the joints of the extremi|ties, or to the &s;kin of the face, by preventing the nece&s;&s;ary torpor of the&s;e parts previous to the inflammation of them; in the &s;ame man|ner as cold fits of fever are prevented by the &s;ame medicines; and, as I believe, the returns of the gout have &s;ometimes for two or three years been prevented by them.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e patients died of the apoplexy in a few hours; and the other of an inflammation of the liver, which I believe was called the gout, and in con&s;equence was not treated by ven$&s;ection, and other evacuations. From hence it appears, that the daily u&s;e of hop in our malt liquor mu&s;t add to the noxious quality of the &s;pirit in it, when taken to exce&s;s, and contribute to the production of apoplexy, or inflammation of the liver.</P>

<HEAD>II. OBSERVATIONS ON THE INVERTENTIA.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. 1. The action of vomiting &s;eems originally to have been occa|&s;ioned by di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation from the di&s;tention or acrimony of the aliment; in the &s;ame manner as when any di&s;gu&s;tful material is taken into the mouth, as a bitter drug, and is rejected by the retrograde motions of the tongue and lips; as explained in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 2. and mentioned in Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. Or the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation may thus excite the power of volition, which may al&s;o contribute to the retrograde actions of the &s;tomach and oe&s;ophagus, as when cows bring up the contents of their fir&s;t &s;tomach to re-ma&s;ticate it. To either of the&s;e is to be attributed the action of mild emetics, which &s;oon cea&s;e to operate, and leave the &s;tomach &s;tronger, or more irritable, after their operation; owing to the accumulation of the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation during its torpid or inverted action. Such appears to be the operation of ipecacuanha, or of antimonium tartarizatum, in &s;mall do&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. But there is rea&s;on to believe, that the &s;tronger emetics, as di|gitalis, fir&s;t &s;timulate the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tomach into greater action; and that the inverted motions of the&s;e ab&s;orbents next occur, pouring the lymph, lately taken up, or obtained from other lympha|tic branches, into the &s;tomach: the quantity of which in &s;ome di&s;|ea&s;es, as in the cholera morbus, is inconceivable. This inverted mo|tion, fir&s;t of the ab&s;orbents of the &s;tomach, and afterwards of the &s;tomach it&s;elf, &s;eems to originate from the exhau&s;tion or debility, which &s;ucceeds the unnatural degree of action, into which they had been previou&s;ly &s;timulated. An unu&s;ual defect of &s;timulus, as of food without &s;pice or wine in the &s;tomachs of tho&s;e, who have been much

accu&s;tomed to &s;pice or wine, will induce &s;ickne&s;s or vomiting; in this ca&s;e the defective energy of the &s;tomach is owing to defect of ac|cu&s;tomed &s;timulus; while the action of vomiting from digitalis is owing to a deficiency of &s;en&s;orial power, which is previou&s;ly ex|hau&s;ted by the exce&s;s of its &s;timulus. See Sect. XXXV. 1. 3. and Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 2.</P>
<P>For fir&s;t, no increa&s;e of heat ari&s;es from this action of vomiting; which always occurs, when the &s;ecerning &s;y&s;tem is &s;timulated into action. Secondly, the motions of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els are as liable to inver&s;ion as the &s;tomach it&s;elf; which la&s;t, with the oe&s;ophagus, may be con&s;idered as the ab&s;orbent mouth and belly of that great gland, the inte&s;tinal canal. Thirdly, the cla&s;s of &s;orbentia, as bitters and metallic &s;alts, given in large do&s;es, become invertentia, and vo|mit, or purge. And la&s;tly, the &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting induced by large potations of wine, or opium, does not occur till next day in &s;ome people, in none till &s;ome time after their ingurgitation. And tincture of digitalis in the do&s;e of 30 or 60 drops, though applied in &s;olution, is a con&s;iderable time before it produces its effect; though vomiting is in&s;tantaneou&s;ly induced by a nau&s;eous idea, or a nau&s;eous ta&s;te in the mouth. At the &s;ame time there &s;eem to be &s;ome mate|rials, which can immediately &s;timulate the &s;tomach into &s;uch power|ful action, as to be immediately &s;ucceeded by paraly&s;is of it, and con|&s;equent continued fever, or immediate death; and this without ex|citing &s;en&s;ation, that is, without our perceiving it. Of the&s;e are the contagious matter of &s;ome fevers &s;wallowed with the &s;aliva, and pro|bably a few grains of ar&s;enic taken in &s;olution. See Suppl. I. 8. 8. Art. IV. 2. 6. 9.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some branches of the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem become inverted by their &s;ympathy with other branches, which are only &s;timulated into too violent ab&s;orption. Thus when the &s;tomach and duodenum are much &s;timulated by alcohol, by nitre, or by worms, in &s;ome per&s;ons
<PB N="742" REF="7490">
the urinary lymphatics have their motion inverted, and pour that ma|terial into the bladder, which is ab&s;orbed from the inte&s;tines. Hence the drunken diabetes is produced; and hence chyle is &s;een in the urine in worm ca&s;es.</P>
<P>When on the contrary &s;ome branches of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tems have their motions inverted in con&s;equence of the previous exhau&s;tion of their &s;en&s;orial power by any violent &s;timulus, other branches of it have their ab&s;orbent power greatly increa&s;ed. Hence continued vo|miting, or violent cathartics, produce great ab&s;orption from the cel|lular membrane in ca&s;es of drop&s;y; and the fluids thus ab&s;orbed are poured into the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines by the inverted motions of the lacteals and lymphatics. See Sect. XXIX. 4. and 5.</P>
<P N="4">4. The quantity of the do&s;e of an emetic is not of &s;o great con&s;e|quence as of other medicines, as the greate&s;t part of it is rejected with the fir&s;t effort. All emetics are &s;aid to act with greater certainty when given in a morning, if an opiate had been given the night be|fore. For the &s;en&s;orial power of irritation of the &s;tomach had thus been in &s;ome mea&s;ure previou&s;ly exhau&s;ted by the &s;timulus of the opium, which thus facilitates the action of the emetic; and which, when the do&s;e of opium has been large, is frequently followed on the next day by &s;pontaneous &s;ickne&s;s and vomitings, as after violent intoxication.</P>
<P>Ipecacuanha is the mo&s;t certain in its effect from five grains to thirty; white vitriol is the mo&s;t expeditious in its effect, from twenty grains to thirty di&s;&s;olved in warm water; but emetic tartar, antimo|nium tartarizatum, from one grain to four to &s;ane people, and from thence to twenty to in&s;ane patients, will an&s;wer mo&s;t of the u&s;eful purpo&s;es of emetics; but nothing equals the digitalis purpurea for the purpo&s;e of ab&s;orbing water from the cellular membrane in the ana&s;arca pulmonum, or hydrops pectoris. See Art. II. 3. 7.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="743" REF="7500">
II. Violent cathartics. 1. Where violent cathartics are required, as in drop&s;ies, the &s;quill in dried powder made into &s;mall pills of a grain, or a grain and a half, one to be given every hour till they operate bri&s;kly, is very efficacious; or half a grain of emetic tartar di&s;&s;olved in an ounce of peppermint-water, and given every hour, till it operates. Scammony, and other &s;trong purges, are liable to pro|duce hypercathar&s;is, if they are not nicely prepared, and accurately weighed, and are thence dangerous in common practice. Gamboge is uncertain in its effects, it has otherwi&s;e the good property of being ta&s;tele&s;s; and on that account &s;ome preparation of it might be u&s;eful for children, by which its do&s;e could be a&s;certained, and its effects rendered more uniform.</P>
<P N="2">2. In inflammations of the bowels with con&s;tipation calomel, given in the do&s;e from ten to twenty grains after due vene&s;ection, is mo&s;t efficacious; and if made into very &s;mall pills is not liable to be re|jected by vomiting, which generally attends tho&s;e ca&s;es. When this fails, a grain of aloes every hour will find its way, if the bowel is not de&s;troyed; and &s;ometimes, I believe, if it be, when the mortification is not exten&s;ive. If the vomiting continues after the pain cea&s;es, and e&s;pecially if the bowels become tumid with air, which &s;ounds on being &s;truck with the finger, the&s;e patients &s;eldom recover. Opiates given along with the cathartics I believe to be frequently injurious in inflammation of the bowels, though they may thus be given with ad|vantage in the &s;aturnine colic; the pain and con&s;tipation in which di&s;ea&s;e are owing to torpor or inactivity, and not to too great action.</P>
<P N="3">III. Violent errhines and &s;ialagogues. 1. Turpeth mineral in the quantity of one grain mixed with ten grains of &s;ugar an&s;wers every purpo&s;e to be expected from errhines. Their operation is by inverting
<PB N="744" REF="7510">
the motions of the lymphatics of the membrane, which lines the no&s;trils, and the caverns of the forehead and cheeks; and may thence po&s;&s;ibly be of &s;ervice in the hydrocephalus internus.</P>
<P>Some other violent errhines, as the powder of white hellebore, or Cayan pepper, diluted with &s;ome le&s;s acrid powder, are &s;aid to cure &s;ome cold or nervous head-achs; which may be effected by inflaming the no&s;trils, and thus introducing the &s;en&s;orial power of &s;en&s;ation, as well as increa&s;ing that of irritation; and thus to produce violent ac|tion of the membranes of the no&s;trils, and of the frontal and maxillary &s;inu&s;es, which may by a&s;&s;ociation excite into action the torpid mem|branes, which occa&s;ion the head-ach.</P>
<P N="2">2. A copious &s;alivation without any increa&s;e of heat often attends hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;es, and fevers with debility, owing to an inver&s;ion of the lymphatics of the mouth, &s;ee Cla&s;s I. 1. 2. 6. The &s;ame occurs in the nau&s;ea, which precedes vomiting; and is al&s;o excitable by di&s;|agreeable ta&s;tes, as by &s;quills, or by nau&s;eous &s;mells, or by nau&s;eous ideas. The&s;e are very &s;imilar to the occa&s;ional di&s;charge of a thin fluid from the no&s;trils of &s;ome people, which recurs at certain periods, and differs from defective ab&s;orption.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Violent diuretics. 1. If nitre be given from a dram to half an ounce in a morning at repeated draughts, the patient becomes &s;icki&s;h, and much pale water is thrown into the bladder by the inverted ac|tion of the urinary lymphatics. Hence the ab&s;orption in ulcers is i$|crea&s;ed and the cure forwarded, as ob&s;erved by Dr. Rowley.</P>
<P N="2">2. Cantharides taken inwardly &s;o &s;timulate the neck of the bladder as to increa&s;e the di&s;charge of mucus, which appears in the urine; but I once &s;aw a large do&s;e taken by mi&s;take, not le&s;s than half an ounce or an ounce of the tincture, by which I &s;uppo&s;e the urinary
<PB N="745" REF="7520">
lymphatics were thrown into violent inverted motions, for the pa|tient drank repeated draughts of &s;ubtepid water to the quantity of a gallon or two in a few hours; and during the greate&s;t part of that time he was not I believe two entire minutes together without making water. A little blood was &s;een in his water the next day, and a &s;ore|ne&s;s continued a day longer without any other inconvenience.</P>
<P N="3">3. The decoction of foxglove &s;hould al&s;o be mentioned here, as great effu&s;ions of urine frequently follow its exhibition. See Art. IV. 2. 3. 7. And an infu&s;ion or tincture of tobacco as recommended by Dr. Fowler of York.</P>
<P N="4">4. Alcohol, and opium, if taken &s;o as to induce &s;light intoxication, and the body be kept cool, and much diluting liquids taken along with them, have &s;imilar effect in producing for a time a greater flow of urine, as mo&s;t intemperate drinkers mu&s;t occa&s;ionally have ob&s;erved. This circum&s;tance &s;eems to have introduced the u&s;e of gin, and other vinous &s;pirits as a diuretic, unfortunately in the gravel, among&s;t ig|norant people; which di&s;ea&s;e is generally produced by fermented or &s;pirituous liquors, and always increa&s;ed by them.</P>
<P N="5">5. Fear and anxiety are well known to produce a great frequency of making water. A per&s;on, who believed he had made a bad pur|cha&s;e concerning an e&s;tate, told me, that he made five or &s;ix pints of water during a &s;leeple&s;s night, which &s;ucceeded his bargain; and it is u&s;ual, where young men are waiting in an anti-room to be examin|ed for college preferment, to &s;ee the chamber-pot often wanted.</P>
<P N="5">V. Cold &s;weats about the head, neck, and arms, frequently attend tho&s;e, who&s;e lungs are oppre&s;&s;ed, as in &s;ome drop&s;ies and a&s;thma. A

<DIV3 N="2">
<HEAD>II. OBSERVATIONS ON THE REVERTENTIA.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. The hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;e is attended with inverted motions feebly exerted of the oe&s;ophagus, inte&s;tinal canal and lymphatics of the blad|der. Hence the borborigmi, or rumbling of the bowels, owing to their fluid contents de&s;cending as the air beneath a&s;cends. The glo|bus hy&s;t$ricus con&s;i&s;ts in the retrograde motion of the oe&s;ophagus, and the great flow of urine from that of the lymphatics &s;pread on the neck of the bladder; and a copious &s;alivation &s;ometimes happens to
<PB N="748" REF="7550">
the&s;e patients from the inver&s;ion of the lymphatics of the mouth; and palpitation of the heart owing to weak or incipient inver&s;ion of its motions; and &s;yncope, when this occurs in its greate&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The&s;e hy&s;teric affections are not nece&s;&s;arily attended with pain; though it &s;ometimes happens, that pains, which originate from qui|e&s;cence, afflict the&s;e patients, as the hemicrania, which has errone|ou&s;ly been termed the clavus hy&s;tericus; but which is owing &s;olely to the inaction of the membranes of that part, like the pains attending the cold fits of intermittents, and which frequently returns like them at very regular periods of time.</P>
<P>Many of the above &s;ymptoms are relieved by mu&s;k, ca&s;tor, the foetid gums, valerian, oleum animale, oil of amber, which act in the u&s;ual do&s;e without heating the body. The pains, which &s;ometimes attend the&s;e con&s;titutions, are relieved by the &s;ecernentia, as e&s;&s;ential oils in common tooth-ach, and bal&s;am of Peru in the flatulent colic. But the incitantia, as opium, or vinous &s;pirit, reclaim the&s;e morbid inverted motions with more certainty, than the foetids; and remove the pains, which attend the&s;e con&s;titutions, with more certainty than the &s;ecernentia; but if given in large do&s;es, a debility and return of the hy&s;teric &s;ymptoms occurs, when the effect of the opium or al|cohol cea&s;es. Opiates and foetids joined &s;eem be&s;t to an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e of alleviating the pre&s;ent &s;ymptoms; and the &s;orbentia, by &s;ti|mulating the lymphatics and lacteals into continued action, prevent a relap&s;e of their inver&s;ion, as Peruvian bark, and ru&s;t of iron. See Cla&s;s I. 3. 1. 10.</P>
<P N="2">II. Vomiting con&s;i&s;ts in the inverted order of the motions of the &s;tomach, and oe&s;ophagus; and is al&s;o attended with the inverted mo|tions of a part of the duodenum, when bile is ejected; and of the lymphatics of the &s;tomach and fauces, when nau&s;ea attends, and when much lymph is evacuated. Permanent vomiting is for a time relieved by the incitantia, as opium or alcohol; but is liable to return, when
<PB N="749" REF="7560">
their action cea&s;es. A bli&s;ter on the back, or on the &s;tomach, is more efficacious for re&s;training vomiting by their &s;timulating into action the external &s;kin, and by &s;ympathy affecting the membranes of the &s;to|mach. In &s;ome fevers attended with ince&s;&s;ant vomiting Sydenham advi&s;ed the patient to put his head under the bed-clothes, till a &s;weat appeared on the &s;kin, as explained in Cla&s;s IV. 1. 1. 3.</P>
<P>In chronical vomiting I have ob&s;erved crude mercury of good effect in the do&s;e of half an ounce twice a day. The vomitings, or vain efforts to vomit, which &s;ometimes attend hy&s;teric or epileptic patients, are frequently in&s;tantly relieved for a time by applying flour of mu&s;|tard-&s;eed and water to the &s;mall of the leg; and removing it, as &s;oon as the pain becomes con&s;iderable. If &s;inapi&s;ms lie on too long, e&s;|pecially in paralytic ca&s;es, they are liable to produce trouble&s;ome ul|cers. A pla&s;ter or catapla&s;m, with opium and camphor on the region of the &s;tomach, will &s;ometimes revert its retrograde motions.</P>
<P N="3">III. Violent cathar&s;is, as in diarrhoea or dy&s;entery, is attended with inverted motions of the lymphatics of the inte&s;tines, and is ge|nerally owing to &s;ome &s;timulating material. This is counteracted by plenty of mucilaginous liquids, as &s;olutions of gum arabic, or &s;mall chicken broth, to wa&s;h away or dilute the &s;timulating material, which cau&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e. And then by the u&s;e of the inte&s;tinal &s;orbentia, Art. IV. 2. 5. as rhubarb, decoction of logwood, calcined hart&s;horn, Armenian bole; and la&s;tly, by the incitantia, as opium.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The diaboetes con&s;i&s;ts in the inverted motions of the urinary lymphatics, which is generally I &s;uppo&s;e owing to the too great ac|tion of &s;ome other branch of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem. The urinary branch &s;hould be &s;timulated by cantharides, turpentine, re&s;in (which when taken in larger do&s;es may po&s;&s;ibly excite it into inverted ac|tion), by the &s;orbentia and opium. The inte&s;tinal lymphatics &s;hould

be rendered le&s;s active by torpentia, as calcareous earth, earth of alum; and tho&s;e of the &s;kin by oil externally applied over the whole body; and by the warm-bath, which &s;hould be of 96 or 98 degrees of heat, and the patient &s;hould &s;it in it every day for half an hour.</P>
<P N="5">V. Inverted motions of the inte&s;tinal canal with all the lymphatics, which open into it, con&s;titute the ileus, or iliac pa&s;&s;ion; in which di&s;ea&s;e it &s;ometimes happens, that cly&s;ters are returned by the mouth. After vene&s;ection from ten grains to twenty of calomel made into very &s;mall pills; if this is rejected, a grain of aloe every hour; a bli&s;|ter; crude mercury; warm-bath; if a cly&s;ter of iced water?</P>
<P>Many other inverted motions of different parts of the &s;y&s;tem are de&s;cribed in Cla&s;s I. 3. and which are to be treated in a manner &s;imi|lar to tho&s;e above de&s;cribed. It mu&s;t be noted, that the medicines mentioned under number one in the catalogue of revertentia are the true articles belonging to this cla&s;s of medicines. Tho&s;e enumerated in the other four divi&s;ions are chiefly &s;uch things as tend to remove the &s;timulating cau&s;es, which have induced the inver&s;ion of the mo|tions of the part, as acrimonious contents, or inflammation, of the bowels in diarrhoea, diabetes, or in ileus. But it is probable after the&s;e remote cau&s;es are de&s;troyed, that the fetid gums, mu&s;k, ca&s;tor, and bal&s;ams, might be given with advantage in all the&s;e ca&s;es.</P>

<P N="1">I. As the torpentia con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch materials as are le&s;s &s;timulating than our u&s;ual diet, it is evident, that where this cla&s;s of medicines is u&s;ed, &s;ome regard mu&s;t be had to the u&s;ual manner of living of the patient both in re&s;pect to quantity and quality. Hence wounds in tho&s;e, who have been accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of much wine, are very liable to mortify, unle&s;s the u&s;ual potation of wine be allowed the patient. And in the&s;e habits I have &s;een a delirium in a fever cured almo&s;t immediately by wine; which was occa&s;ioned by the too mild regimen directed by the attendants. On the contrary in great inflammation, the &s;ubduction of food, and of &s;pirituous drink, con|tributes much to the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e. As by the&s;e means both the &s;timulus from di&s;tention of the ve&s;&s;els, as well as that from the acrimony of the fluids, is decrea&s;ed; but in both the&s;e re&s;pects the previous habits of diet of the patients mu&s;t be attended to. Thus if tea be made &s;tronger, than the patient has u&s;ually drank it, it belongs to the article &s;orbentia; if weaker, it belongs to the tor|pentia.</P>
<P N="2">II. 2. Water in a quantity greater than u&s;ual dimini&s;hes the ac|tion of the &s;y&s;tem not only by diluting our fluids, and thence le&s;&s;en|ing their &s;timulus, but by lubricating the &s;olids; for not only the
<PB N="755" REF="7620">
parts of our &s;olids have their &s;liding over each other facilitated by the interpo&s;ition of aqueous particles; but the particles of mucaginous or &s;accharine &s;olutions &s;lide ea&s;ier over each other by being mixed with a greater portion of water, and thence &s;timulate the ve&s;&s;els le&s;s.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the particles of water them&s;elves, and of animal gluten di&s;&s;olved in water, as the glue u&s;ed by carpenters, &s;lide ea&s;ier over each other by an additional quantity of the fluid matter of heat.</P>
<P>The&s;e two fluids of heat and of water may be e&s;teemed the univer|&s;al &s;olvents or lubricants in re&s;pect to animal bodies, and thus facilitate the circulation, and the &s;ecretion of the various glands. At the &s;ame time it is po&s;&s;ible, that the&s;e two fluids may occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;ume an aerial form, as in the cavity of the che&s;t, and by compre&s;&s;ing the lungs may cau&s;e one kind of a&s;thma, which is relieved by breathing colder air. An increa&s;ed quantity of heat by adding &s;timulus to every part of the &s;y&s;tem belongs to the article Incitantia.</P>
<P N="3">III. 3. 1. The application of cold to the &s;kin, which is only an|other expre&s;&s;ion for the diminution of the degree of heat we are ac|cu&s;tomed to, benumbs the cutaneous ab&s;orbents into inaction; and by &s;ympathy the urinary and inte&s;tinal ab&s;orbents become al&s;o quie&s;cent. The &s;ecerning ve&s;&s;els continuing their action &s;omewhat longer, from the warmth of the blood. Hence the u&s;ual &s;ecretions are poured into the bladder and inte&s;tines, and no ab&s;orption is retaken from them. Hence &s;prinkling the &s;kin with cold water increa&s;es the quantity of urine, which is pale; and of &s;tool, which is fluid; the&s;e have er|roneou&s;ly been a&s;cribed to increa&s;ed &s;ecretion, or to ob&s;tructed per|&s;piration.</P>
<P>The thin di&s;charge from the no&s;trils of &s;ome people in cold weather is owing to the torpid &s;tate of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the membrana &s;neideriana, which as above are benumbed &s;ooner than tho&s;e, which perform the &s;ecretion of the mucus.</P>
<P><PB N="756" REF="7630">
The quick anhelation, and palpitation of the heart, of tho&s;e, who are immer&s;ed in cold water, depends on the quie&s;cence of the exter|nal ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els and capillaries. Hence the cutaneous circulation is dimini&s;hed, and by a&s;&s;ociation an almo&s;t univer&s;al torpor of the &s;y&s;|tem is induced; thence the heart becomes incapable to pu&s;h forwards its blood through all the inactive capillaries and glands; and as the terminating ve&s;&s;els of the pulmonary artery &s;uffer a &s;imilar inac|tion by a&s;&s;ociation, the blood is with difficulty pu&s;hed through the lungs.</P>
<P>Some have imagined, that a &s;pa&s;modic con&s;triction of the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els took place, and have thus accounted for their re&s;i&s;tance to the force of the heart. But there &s;eems no nece&s;&s;ity to introduce this imaginary &s;pa&s;m; &s;ince tho&s;e, who are conver&s;ant in injecting bodies, find it nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to put them into warm water to take away the &s;tiffne&s;s of the cold dead ve&s;&s;els; which become inflexible like the other mu&s;cles of dead animals, and prevent the injected fluid from pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>All the &s;ame &s;ymptoms occur in the cold fits of intermittents; in the&s;e the coldne&s;s and palene&s;s of the &s;kin with thir&s;t evince the di|minution of cutaneous ab&s;orption; and the dryne&s;s of ulcers, and &s;mall &s;ecretion of urine, evince the torpor of the &s;ecerning &s;y&s;tem; and the anhelation, and coldne&s;s of the breath, &s;hew the terminations of the pulmonary artery to be likewi&s;e affected with torpor.</P>
<P>After the&s;e ve&s;&s;els of the whole &s;urface of the body both ab&s;orbent and &s;ecretory have been for a time to$$id by the application of cold water; and all the internal &s;ecerning and ab&s;orbent ones have been made torpid from their a&s;&s;ociation with the external; as &s;oon as their u&s;ual &s;timulus of warmth is renewed, they are thrown into more than their u&s;ual energy of action; as the hands become hot and pain|ful on approaching the $ire after having been immer&s;ed &s;ome time in &s;now. Hence the face becomes of a red colour in a cold day on turn|ing from the wind, and the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration increa&s;ed by repeatedly
<PB N="757" REF="7640">
going into fro&s;ty air, but not continuing in it too long at a time.</P>
<P N="2">2. When by the too great warmth of a room or of clothes the &s;e|cretion of per&s;pirable matter is much increa&s;ed, the &s;trength of the patient is much exhau&s;ted by this nece&s;&s;ary exertion of the capillary &s;y&s;tem, and thence of the whole &s;ecerning and arterial &s;y&s;tem by a&s;|&s;ociation. The diminution of external heat immediately induces a torpor or quie&s;cence of the&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary exertions, and the patient in&s;tantly feels him&s;elf &s;trengthened, and exhilarated; the animal power, which was thus wa&s;ted in vain, being now applied to more u&s;eful purpo&s;es. Thus when the limbs on one &s;ide are di&s;abled by a &s;troke of the pal&s;y, tho&s;e of the other &s;ide are perpetually in mo|tion. And hence all people bear riding and other exerci&s;es be&s;t in cold weather.</P>
<P>Patients in fevers, where the &s;kin is hot, are immediately &s;trength|ened by cold air; which is therefore of great u&s;e in fevers attended with debility and heat; but may perhaps be of temporary di&s;&s;ervice, if too ha&s;tily applied in &s;ome &s;ituations of fevers attended with internal topical inflammation, as in peripneumony or pleuri&s;y, where the ar|terial &s;trength is too great already, and the increa&s;ed action of the ex|ternal capillaries being de&s;troyed by the cold, the action of the inter|nal inflamed part may be &s;uddenly increa&s;ed, unle&s;s vene&s;ection and other evacuations are applied at the &s;ame time. Yet in mo&s;t ca&s;es the application of cold is neverthele&s;s &s;alutary, as by decrea&s;ing the heat of the particles of blood in the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els, the &s;timulus of them, and the di&s;tention of the ve&s;&s;els becomes con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened. In external inflammations, as the &s;mall-pox, and perhaps the gout and rheumati&s;m, the application of cold air mu&s;t be of great &s;ervice by dec$ea&s;ing the action of the inflamed &s;kin, though the contrary is too frequently the practice in tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that for all the&s;e purpo&s;es the application of it &s;hould be continued a long
<PB N="758" REF="7650">
time, otherwi&s;e an increa&s;ed exertion follows the temporary torpor, before the di&s;ea&s;e is de&s;troyed.</P>
<P N="3">3. After immer&s;ion in cold water or in cold air the whole &s;y&s;tem becomes more exciteable by the natural degree of &s;timulus, as appears from the &s;ub&s;equent glow on the &s;kin of people otherwi&s;e pale; and even by a degree of &s;timulus le&s;s than natural, as appears by their becoming warm in a &s;hort time during their continuance in a bath, of about 80 degrees of heat, as in Buxton bath. See Sect. XII. 2. 1. XXXII. 3. 3.</P>
<P>This increa&s;ed exertion happens to the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els more par|ticularly, as they are fir&s;t and mo&s;t affected by the&s;e temporary dimi|nutions of heat; and hence like the medicines, which promote ab|&s;orption, the cold-bath contributes to &s;trengthen the con&s;titution, that is to increa&s;e its irritability; for the di&s;ea&s;es attended with weak|ne&s;s, as nervous fevers and hy&s;teric di&s;ea&s;es, are &s;hewn in Section XXXII. 2. 1. to proceed from a want of irritability, not from an ex|ce&s;s of it. Hence the dige&s;tion is greater in fro&s;ty weather, and the quantity of per&s;piration. For the&s;e purpo&s;es the application of cold mu&s;t not be continued too long. For in riding a journey in cold wea|ther, when the feet are long kept too cold, the dige&s;tion is impaired, and cardialgia produced.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the diminution of external heat be too great, produced too ha&s;tily, or continued too long, the torpor of the &s;y&s;tem either be|comes &s;o great, that the animal cea&s;es to live; or &s;o great an energy of motion or orga&s;m of the ve&s;&s;els &s;ucceeds, as to produce fever or in|flammation. This mo&s;t frequently happens after the body has been temporarily heated by exerci&s;e, warm rooms, anger, or intemperance. Hence colds are produced in the external air by re&s;ting after exerci&s;e, or by drinking cold water. See Cla&s;s I. 2. 2. 1.</P>
<P>Frequent cold immer&s;ions harden or invigorate the con&s;titution,
<PB N="759" REF="7660">
which they effect by habituating the body to bear a diminution of heat on its &s;urface without being thrown into &s;uch exten&s;ive torpor or quie&s;cence by the con&s;ent of the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin with the pul|monary and glandular &s;y&s;tem; as tho&s;e experience, who frequently u&s;e the cold-bath. At fir&s;t they have great anhelation and palpita|tion of heart at their ingre&s;s into cold water; but by the habit of a few weeks they are able to bear this diminution of heat with little or no inconvenience; for the power of volition has &s;ome influence over the mu&s;cles &s;ub&s;ervient to re&s;piration, and by its counter efforts gra|dually prevents the quick breathing, and dimini&s;hes the a&s;&s;ociations of the pulmonary ve&s;&s;els with the cutaneous ones. And thus though the &s;ame quantity of heat is &s;ubducted from the &s;kin, yet the torpor of the pulmonary ve&s;&s;els and internal glands does not follow. Hence during cold immer&s;ion le&s;s &s;en&s;orial power is accumulated, and in con&s;equence, le&s;s exertion of it &s;ucceeds on emerging from the bath. Whence &s;uch people are e&s;teemed hardy, and bear the common vari|ations of atmo&s;pheric temperature without inconvenience. See Sect. XXXII. 3. 2.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Vene&s;ection has a ju&s;t title to be cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t the torpentia in ca&s;es of fever with arterial &s;trength, known by the fulne&s;s and hardne&s;s of the pul&s;e. In the&s;e ca&s;es the heat becomes le&s;s by its u&s;e, and all exuberant &s;ecretions, as of bile or &s;weat, are dimini&s;hed, and room is made in the blood-ve&s;&s;els for the ab&s;orption of mild fluids; and hence the ab&s;orption al&s;o of new ve&s;&s;els, or extrava&s;ated fluids, the produce of inflammation, is promoted. Hence vene&s;ection is pro|perly cla&s;&s;ed among&s;t the &s;orbentia, as like other evacuations it pro|motes general ab&s;orption, re&s;trains haemorrhages, and cures tho&s;e pains, which originate from the too great action of the &s;ecerning ve&s;|&s;els, or from the torpor of the ab&s;orbents. I have more than once been witne&s;s to the &s;udden removal of nervous head-achs by vene&s;ection,
<PB N="760" REF="7670">
though the patient was already exhau&s;ted, pale, and feeble; and to its great u&s;e in convul&s;ions and madne&s;s, whether the patient was &s;trong or weak; which di&s;ea&s;es are the con&s;equence of nervous pains; and to its &s;topping long debilitating haemorrhages from the uterus, when other means had been in vain e&s;&s;ayed. In inflammatory pains, and inflammatory haemorrhages, every one ju&s;tly applies to it, as the certain and only cure.</P>
<P N="5">V. When the circulation is carried on too violently, as in inflam|matory fevers, tho&s;e medicines, which invert the motions of &s;ome parts of the &s;y&s;tem, retard the motions of &s;ome other parts, which are a&s;&s;ociated with them. Hence &s;mall do&s;es of emetic tartar, and ipecacuanha, and large do&s;es of nitre, by producing nau&s;ea debilitate and le&s;&s;en the energy of the circulation, and are thence u&s;eful in in|flammatory di&s;ea&s;es. It mu&s;t be added, that if nitre be &s;wallowed in powder, or &s;oon after it is di&s;&s;olved, it contributes to le&s;&s;en the cir|culation by the cold it generates, like ice-water, or the external appli|cation of cold air.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The re&s;piration of air mixed with a greater proportion of azote than is found in the common atmo&s;phere, or of air mixed with hy|drogen, or with carbonic acid gas, &s;o that the quantity of oxygen might be le&s;s than u&s;ual, would probably act in ca&s;es of inflammation with great advantage. In con&s;umptions this might be mo&s;t conveni|ently and effectually applied, if a phthi&s;ical patient could re&s;ide day and night in a porter or ale brewery, where great quantities of tho&s;e liquors were perpetually fermenting in vats or open barrels; or in &s;ome great manufactory of wines from rai&s;ins or from &s;ugar.</P>
<P>Externally the application of carbonic acid gas to cancers and other ulcers in&s;tead of atmo&s;pheric air may prevent their enlargement, by

<HEAD>INABILITY TO EMPTY THE BLADDER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To be introduced at the end of Cla&s;s III. 2. 1. 6. on Paraly&s;is Ve&s;icae Urinariae.</HEAD>
<P>AN inability to empty the bladder frequently occurs to elderly men, and is often fatal. This &s;ometimes ari&s;es from their having too long been re&s;trained from making water from accidental confine|ment in public &s;ociety, or otherwi&s;e; whence the bladder has become &s;o far di&s;tended as to become paralytic; and not only this, but the neck of the bladder has become contracted &s;o as to re&s;i&s;t the intro|duction of the catheter. In this deplorable ca&s;e it has frequently happened, that the forcible efforts to introduce the catheter have per|forated the urethra; and the in&s;trument has been &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s into the bladder when it has only pa&s;&s;ed into the cellular mem|brane along the &s;ide of it; of which I believe I have &s;een two or three in&s;tances; and afterwards the part has become &s;o much in|flamed as to render the introduction of the catheter into the bladder impracticable.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation the patients are in imminent danger, and &s;ome have advi&s;ed a trocar to be introduced into the bladder from the
<PB N="764" REF="7710">
rectum; which I believe is generally followed by an incurable ulcer. One patient, whom I &s;aw in this &s;ituation, began to make a &s;poonful of water after &s;ix or &s;even days, and gradually in a few days emptied his bladder to about half its &s;ize, and recovered; but I believe he never afterwards was able completely to evacuate it.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation I lately advi&s;ed about two pounds of crude quick|&s;ilver to be poured down a gla&s;s tube, which was part of a baro|meter tube, drawn le&s;s at one end, and about two feet long, into the urethra, as the patient lay on his back; which I had previou&s;ly performed upon a hor&s;e; this ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, into the bladder; on &s;tanding erect it did not return, but on kneeling down, and lying horizontally on his hands, the mercury readily re|turned; and on this account it was believed to have pa&s;&s;ed into the bladder, as it &s;o ea&s;ily returned, when the neck of the bladder was lower than the fundus of it. But neverthele&s;s as no urine followed the mercury, though the bladder was violently di&s;tended, I was led to believe, that the urethra had been perforated by the pre|vious efforts to introduce a catheter and bougee; and that the mercury had pa&s;&s;ed on the out&s;ide of the bladder into the cellular membrane.</P>
<P>As the urethra is &s;o liable to be perforated by the forcible efforts to introduce the catheter, when the bladder is violently di&s;|tended in this deplorable di&s;ea&s;e, I &s;hould &s;trongly recommend the injection of a pound or two of crude mercury into the urethra to open by its weight the neck of the bladder previous to any vio|lent or very frequent e&s;&s;ays with a catheter whether of metal or of ela&s;tic re&s;in.</P>
