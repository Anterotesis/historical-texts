<P>ON the evening appointed, he ha&s;tened after the opera, to the apartment of the charming Italian, who received him with tran&s;port, and had provided an elegant and expen&s;ive &s;upper; after which the Marquis again reque&s;ted her to accept of a proper e&s;tabli&s;hment, but in vain: <Q>You are the lover of my &startq;choice, (&s;aid &s;he) all I po&s;&s;e&s;s is your's,
<PB N="6" REF="4">and my future happine&s;s will con&s;i&s;t in &s;hewing you that the merit, not the for|tune of a lover, entitles him to my &endq;affection.</Q> Mon&s;ieur D'Illois was enraptured with the refinement and deli|cacy of her &s;entiments, and determined to &s;eek a favourable opportunity to con|vince her of his genero&s;ity: happily, it was not long before fortune was in this particular favourable to his wi&s;hes&mdash;he did not return home that night, and the very next morning, whil&s;t they were &s;it|ting at breakfa&s;t, there entered the room a mercer and a jeweller, who, after having properly apologized for their intru&s;ion, <Q>&startq;We called, Madam (&s;aid they) to know whether you have any commands for us, this being the time of year we have been always honoured with your &endq;orders.</Q> <Q>It is true, (&s;aid the di&s;inte|re&s;ted &startq;fair one) but I have been parti|cularly
<PB N="7" REF="5">unfortunate, my &s;alary has not been regularly paid; I am poor and cannot afford what I u&s;ed to do, as you well know I never accept of pre&s;ents from any one, therefore, have not the re&s;ources of intere&s;ted women: I am now engaged; if you will return when this gentleman is gone, I will look over the articles you have brought, and &s;upply my&s;elf with what I can pay for, as debts, you know, are my aver&s;ion; but pray, go now, as I &s;hall not buy &endq;any thing whil&s;t the Marquis is here.</Q> Mon&s;ieur D'Illois declared, he po&s;itively liked to &s;ee fine things, and wi&s;hed to be a judge of her ta&s;te, and u&s;ed &s;o many entreaties, that at la&s;t &s;he con&s;ented he &s;hould &s;tay. The mercer unfolded &s;eve|ral rich fa&s;hionable &s;ilks; the jeweller di&s;played watches, rings, &s;nuff boxes, lockets, and trinkets of various &s;orts;
<PB N="8" REF="6">the lady &s;aw &s;everal &s;he liked, but ob&s;erved they were all too dear: the Marquis, on the contrary, declared he thought the prices very rea&s;onable, and begged her acceptance of any toys or &s;ilks &s;he wi&s;hed to have, but &s;he prote&s;ted again&s;t it with great firm|ne&s;s, and refu&s;ed every thing he offered; at length &s;he drew the mercer towards the window to agree with him for the price of a &s;ilk, and whil&s;t &s;he was &s;o en|gaged, Mon&s;ieur d'Illois gave the jeweller his addre&s;s, with &s;trict orders that he &s;hould &s;uffer her to &s;elect what articles &s;he liked, and, on his return home, ordered him to &s;end the bill to the Marquis's &s;teward, who would di&s;charge it imme|diately. Whil&s;t &s;he was talking with the jeweller, he practi&s;ed the &s;ame artifice with the mercer, but not &s;o &s;ecretly but &s;he di&s;covered the deceit, to her infi|nite
<PB N="9" REF="7">regret, as &s;he had cho&s;en &s;everal things of each; but vain were all her ge|nerous re&s;olutions, as the trade&s;men were gone, and the valet who was &s;ent after them could not overtake them; and, as if every thing united to di&s;tre&s;s her, they were travelling merchants who came from a di&s;tant province, and &s;he knew not where they were to be met with. Thus the Marquis had the &s;atisfaction of pre|&s;enting his charmer with the value of twenty thou&s;and francs, and yet returned home with the &s;incere&s;t admiration of her di&s;intere&s;ted love, and fully convinced of the great genero&s;ity of her &s;entiments.</P>

<P>THE Marquis regretted not &s;ums &s;o &s;pent, however con&s;iderable, whil&s;t they &s;atisfied his caprices, and he kept his three mi&s;tre&s;&s;es in great &s;plendor, though he had &s;uch a variety of engage|ments that he &s;eldom vi&s;ited any of them; and whenever he went to his little dancer, he was obliged to u&s;e &s;ome kind of pre|caution in his introduction, for &s;he had made him promi&s;e never to come but by night, and without a carriage, <Q>That &startq;the only foible in her character (&s;he told him) might be &s;till a &s;ecret to &endq;the neighbours.</Q> The Marquis, who was good natured, was ea&s;ily prevailed on to gratify her in this particular, be&s;ides an air of my&s;tery in an intrigue was a
<PB N="11" REF="9">novelty he did not di&s;like; he u&s;ed, therefore, to go to her on foot, wrapt up in a long cloak after midnight, and letting him&s;elf in at a garden gate, creep &s;oftly to her apartment, and this only when it had been regulated between them the day before, as &s;he could not &s;ubmit to be looked upon by him as an ea&s;y fair one who mu&s;t &s;ubmit to receive his vi|&s;its whenever he plea&s;ed. Indeed, &s;o rare is it to po&s;&s;e&s;s an opera dancer who admits only one lover, that &s;uch a phae|nomenon ought to be treated with un|common tenderne&s;s and delicacy.</P>

<P>IN one of the&s;e nocturnal vi&s;its, the Marquis was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed to find his Adelaide bathed in tears; in vain did &s;he endeavour to wear a &s;mile on his appearance, and di&s;&s;emble her &s;orrows, whil&s;t the officious mama &s;trove without &s;ucce&s;s to admini&s;ter con&s;olation to the weeping beauty. Alarmed at her de&s;pair, Mon&s;ieur D'Illois in&s;i&s;ted on being made acquainted with her grief, but &s;he return|ed no other an&s;wer than &s;ighs; the Marquis at length conjured her not to conceal the cau&s;e any longer, and &s;wore mo&s;t &s;olemnly he would do all in in his power to di&s;&s;ipate her unea&s;ine&s;s, and make her happy. Overcome by the&s;e promi&s;es &s;he wiped her lovely eyes, and looking tenderly on him, <Q>I am,
<PB N="13" REF="11">&startq;(&s;aid &s;he) indeed, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and un|happy to the la&s;t degree; all my com|panions at the theatre de&s;pi&s;e me, and treat me with a contempt I cannot bear; they laugh at me, and &s;ay my appearance is a di&s;credit to them, nor can I deny it, as they are mo&s;t of them covered with jewels, have each rich bracelets, &s;uperb necklaces, and large diamond ear-rings, whil&s;t I have only two or three &s;habby brilliant pins, which look &s;o mi&s;erably when com|pared with their's, that I blu&s;h when|ever I am forced to place my&s;elf by them on the &s;tage; and this night (to complete my mortification), little Vic|toria, who is frightfully ugly, came in, adorned with a &s;uit of diamonds that ought to have been mine, for they were given her by that booby of an Engli&s;h lord who made propo&s;als
<PB N="14" REF="12">to me: when I &s;aw her thus orna|mented I was ready to &s;ink with &s;hame and confu&s;ion, and I believe it will &endq;break my heart.</Q> She again bur&s;t into tears, and the Marquis vainly en|deavoured to pacify her, 'till at length di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by her unea&s;ine&s;s, he &s;wore to her, that the next evening &s;he &s;hould &s;urpa&s;s her companions in magnificence as well as beauty. The &s;udden revolution this promi&s;e made in the fair one's di&s;|po&s;ition was a&s;toni&s;hing; &s;he became lively, gay and entertaining, and charm|ed the Marquis &s;o much, that after he quitted her next morning, he went in|&s;tantly to his jeweller's, and &s;ent by a faithful valet to her toilette, a &s;hagreen ca&s;e, the richne&s;s and beauty of it's con|tents &s;oon bani&s;hed all &s;orrows, and left her not any rea&s;on to envy Victoria, or any other of her companions.</P>

<P>THE Marchione&s;s d' Illois whom we left very angry with her favourite the Abb&eacute;, from that time de&s;pi&s;ed him very &s;incerely, and on his part the blows and indignity he had &s;uffered on her ac|count, made him hate her mo&s;t cordially; the only que&s;tion on the &s;ide of the Mar|chione&s;s was, who &s;hould &s;ucceed him? The certainty of her connection with the Abb&eacute;, the levity of her conduct, and beauty of her per&s;on drew round her numbers of gay, di&s;&s;ipated young men of fa&s;hion, who had rea&s;on to hope her fa|vours might without much difficulty be obtained; the general homage paid to her charms embarra&s;&s;ed her in her choice, and though her determination was to ac|cept a lover, it was for &s;ome time diffi|cult to &s;ay which was the happy man &s;he intended to prefer.</P>

<P>AT la&s;t, however, it happened that the Marchione&s;s one evening at a ball, at a friend's hou&s;e, met with the Vi&s;|count De l'Enclu&s;e; he was a tall boy, ju&s;t turned of nineteen, in the bloom of youth; the lu&s;tre of health glowed on his cheeks; an animated complexion, &s;parkling eyes, and white even teeth, gained him the admiration of mo&s;t of the ladies; he was well &s;haped for his &s;ize, but rather inclined to fat, he was audacious, lively and familiar in his be|haviour among women, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;ed, liked him the better for the impertinence with which he addre&s;&s;ed them: his character was
<PB N="17" REF="17">not &s;o amiable as his figure; he was both malicious and &s;piteful, would repeat and propagate &s;candal of tho&s;e to whom he profe&s;&s;ed friend&s;hip; was particularly &s;ati|rical on the conduct of women, as his ad|ventures among the worthle&s;s part of the &s;ex had been &s;o many that he had from thence imbibed an illiberal notion of all. This was the man with whom Madame D'Illois became captivated at fir&s;t &s;ight; &s;he thought him the mo&s;t entertaining, agreeable creature in the world, and as he treated her with very little ceremony, &s;he encouraged him by laughing at the &s;candalous anecdotes he told of her ac|quaintance, and permitted him great li|berties in his conver&s;ation, not doubting but when &s;he cho&s;e to a&s;&s;ume a different mode of behaviour, &s;he could ea&s;ily awe him into a proper re&s;pect; but the Vi&s;|count was too much u&s;ed to the advances
<PB N="18" REF="18">of the ladies, not to perceive the impre&s;&s;ion he had made on the Marchione&s;s, or to be &s;o ea&s;ily repul&s;ed: her partiality to him was too apparent to be denied, he therefore at|tached him&s;elf to her, and the Marchio|ne&s;s already more than half vanqui&s;hed by the depravity of her own inclination, yielded in a very &s;hort time to her new lover, and became as compleatly ridicu|lous towards him in her behaviour as any of tho&s;e unfortunate women who&s;e hi&s;|tories he had entertained her with.</P>

<HEAD>FOLLY CXLI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Vi&s;count, by a very extraordi|nary effort and mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing ta|citurnity, kept the &s;ecret of his conque&s;t over Madame D'Illois for three whole days, at the end of which he was un|able to re&s;i&s;t the plea&s;ure of relating it to &s;ome of his intimate friends, (after taking the precaution to &s;wear them to &s;ecre&s;y, which they doubtle&s;s ob&s;erved with the &s;ame delicacy he had done him|&s;elf); but grown more negligent in a few days after, when he had fini&s;hed his u&s;ual bottle of champaigne, <Q>Come, (he would &startq;&s;ay) let us drink a bumper to poor little D'Illois, the be&s;t woman in the world, and &s;o partial to me that it is a&s;toni&s;hing; my acquaintance with her has been &s;o &s;hort, that I am &s;ur|prized
<PB N="20" REF="20">my&s;elf at the rapidity of my &s;ucce&s;s. I may &s;ay with Cae&s;ar, I came, &s;aw, and conquered. I have not the honour of knowing the lady's hu&s;band, but I am &s;ure he has the mo&s;t ea&s;y, gentle-temper'd wife in Pa|ris.&endq;</Q> Not content with treating her name with &s;o little re&s;erve among&s;t his companions, he prevailed on Madame D'Illois to give him her picture, which &s;he readily granted, and looked on the reque&s;t as a proof of his pa&s;&s;ion, little &s;u&s;pecting the purpo&s;e for which he in|tended it.</P>

<HEAD>FOLLY CXLII.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after, the Marquis happened to meet the Vi&s;count at a joyous &s;upper, at the hou&s;e of a friend; they were mutually plea&s;ed with each other's conver&s;ation; and the Marquis being much too polite ever to mention the name of his wife, mo&s;t of the company (and the Vi&s;count among&s;t the re&s;t) looked upon him as a &s;ingle man; be|fore they parted, the Vi&s;count engaged the whole party to &s;pend the following evening at his hou&s;e. They met at the time appointed; and wit, good humour, and plenty of champaigne made them &s;till more gay than they were the night before; mirth and wine elated the fancy of the Vi&s;count, and he began as u&s;ual to boa&s;t the number of his triumphs over the mo&s;t celebrated beauties; and even
<PB N="22" REF="22">went &s;o far as to affirm, <Q>there was not &startq;a truly virtuous woman in the world, at lea&s;t not one who might not be &s;ub|dued by any man of per&s;on and ad|dre&s;s, if he thought it worth his while to give him&s;elf any trouble about her; and to convince you (continued he) that <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s are in this age very rare to be met with, I will &s;hew you the por|traits of tho&s;e whom I have found to be very different creatures, and your&s;elves &s;hall judge from the number of pic|tures in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, how many a monarch might obtain if he had a de|&s;ire to become ma&s;ter of the pictures of all the conde&s;cending fair ones in the &endq;poli&s;hed nations of the univer&s;e:</Q> here he ro&s;e, and opened the door of a large elegant clo&s;et, who&s;e walls were almo&s;t covered with pictures, and illuminated in an elegant ta&s;te; they all ru&s;hed into
<PB N="23" REF="23">it with impatience; and the fir&s;t object that &s;truck the &s;ight of Mon&s;ieur d'Illois was the exact re&s;emblance of his wife; however well-bred a hu&s;band he might be, yet it would be a di&s;honour to human nature not to &s;uppo&s;e he felt a very di&s;a|greeable &s;en&s;ation at this di&s;covery; but he di&s;gui&s;ed his emotion, and, with the calmne&s;s of a philo&s;opher, attended to the Vi&s;count, who enraptured at being thus &s;urrounded with trophies &s;o flattering to his &s;elf-love, pointed to each particular painting, and gave his friends a &s;hort, hi&s;|tory of the fair one it re&s;embled. <Q>The &startq;fir&s;t, gentlemen, (&s;aid he) on my right hand, is old Madame de P&mdash;; no great addition to the collection I con|fe&s;s, but &s;he was my fir&s;t conque&s;t among what is called virtuous ladies; &s;he it &s;eems had a kind of curio&s;ity to know how a boy of &s;ixteen
<PB N="24" REF="24">made love; and I, (out of a frolic) had a mind to try whether a woman of fifty would reli&s;h &s;uch a declaration: next to this old hag, (by way of con|tra&s;t) behold the young blooming Ce|lia; I pur&s;ued her five weeks with un|remitting ardor, but &s;he conde&s;cended not to reward my pa&s;&s;ion till the very day before &s;he married my mo&s;t inti|mate friend the Count of R&mdash;: this little bewitching face (up higher) the Counte&s;s de Morun, who though &s;he &s;cruples not to grant favours to her lovers, has the delicacy to declare &s;he &s;till adores her hu&s;band with the mo&s;t unabated fondne&s;s: this on your left, is the famous devotee Madame de M: who every day in public devoutly prays to heaven that &s;he may be forgiven the &s;ins &s;he hourly commits in private: this haughty beauty is the Dutche&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="25">De C&mdash;, who yielded to my wi&s;hes with a mo&s;t petrifying air of gran|deur; but making u&s;e of the privi|lege of a favoured lover, and going rather abruptly into her apartment three days after, found her in the arms of a footman: that further lady, is the &s;miling prince&s;s of T&mdash;, who, when I hinted at noon in a whi&s;per (after pa&s;&s;ing the night in her apart|ment) that I &s;hould be glad to repeat the a&s;&s;ignation, turned from me and bur&s;t into a loud laugh; told me, &s;he wondered at my a&s;&s;urance, that I ought to know that a <HI>faux pas</HI> in women of her rank, was a mere je&s;t; and that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed I was not to learn that nothing could be more dull than the &endq;repetition of a joke.</Q></P>

<P>IN this manner he ran over great numbers with the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing volubility, 'till he came at la&s;t to that of the Marchione&s;s: <Q>Here!

<PB N="35" REF="35">&startq;&s;moke it (&s;aid he) this is &s;ome pri|vate decampment, there is nothing in it but furniture, &s;o let the dog go on, and we will follow him, and get in where he &s;ets down his lug|gage.&endq;</Q> He then &s;hut the door, and though the coachman did not &s;pare whipcord, we ea&s;ily kept pace with the crazy machine which we had the pati|ence to follow through at lea&s;t a dozen &s;treets, expecting every moment he would be at his journey's end. He came at la&s;t into this very &s;treet, and &s;topped before a little narrow gate-way which leads into a blind alley, a very few yards from hence, and drove up &s;o very clo&s;e to the wall, that I, who happen|ed to be the only one of the party on that &s;ide of the way, was forced to turn into a little alley to avoid the wheels: the ob&s;curity of the place made
<PB N="36" REF="36">it impo&s;&s;ible for me to be perceived, and the coachman believing us all on the other &s;ide of the way, got down, and opened the coach door; a man imme|diately jumped out, and put a large bundle on his &s;houlders; with which the coachman came &s;o very clo&s;e to me that it bru&s;h'd again&s;t me, but with what horror and con&s;ternation was I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, when, by the light of a dark|lantern (which was &s;uddenly opened by the man at the coach &s;ide to light the other in) I plainly perceived that the&s;e pretended goods were no other than dead bodies; &s;ometimes I was touched by the leg of one of them&mdash;at the next turn a cold dangling hand came again&s;t my face; and now and then the head of one with force again&s;t mine; the man with the lantern was &s;o fully convinc|ed that the coa&s;t was clear, that he never
<PB N="37" REF="37">turned the light in any other po&s;ition but what &s;erved to gleam on their dread|ful load, by which I di&s;covered that each corp&s;e was about half covered up in coar&s;e linen cloth, ju&s;t wrapped round it. Among&s;t others, was the body of an infant, who&s;e face appeared &s;wel|led and livid. The air and mein of the wretch at the coach, encrea&s;ed my appre|hen&s;ions; he looked like a cut-throat, and under a loo&s;e hor&s;eman's coat which he wore, I could di&s;cern &s;everal daggers in a kind of belt. The&s;e wretches whil&s;t thus employed held a conver&s;ation &s;hock|ing to think of; which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of remarks on the objects before them: there is one (&s;aid the coachman) that is &s;carce cold now; how devili&s;hly &s;trong and robu&s;t he is! he had trouble enough to get out of this world &s;o quickly,
<PB N="38" REF="38">and a good &s;truggle for it, I warrant. The&s;e &s;ort of ob&s;ervations were pa&s;&s;ed on each as they lugged them in; and I own to you my fears were &s;uch, that I was my&s;elf more dead than alive at that moment; I &s;carce breathed, and drew my&s;elf to the wall as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible; at la&s;t I concluded I mu&s;t un|doubtedly be murdered if I was per|ceived by them, and that I had better call my friends to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for the entrance was almo&s;t rendered impa&s;&s;able by the bodies being laid within it, in order, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to clear the coach till they could di&s;po&s;e of them el&s;e|where. I tried &s;everal times to rai&s;e my voice, but the &s;ound died upon my tongue; at length fear, by encrea&s;ing my panic, gave me utterance, and I gave &s;o loud and piercing a cry, that the
<PB N="39" REF="39">cur&s;ed coachman, and the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in him&s;elf, both became immoveable; my friends alarmed for my fafety, ran to my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and turning a&s;ide the heads of the hor&s;es came into the alley, where I ex|pected my la&s;t moment was approach|ing. On the noi&s;e they made, the mi&s;|creant opened the lantern and the hor|rid &s;ight of &s;o many carca&s;es a&s;toni&s;hed them nearly as much as it had done me. <Q>&startq;For God' &s;ake! (&s;aid I) lay hold of that villain, who having perpetrated &s;uch a number of murders, con&s;pires with the coachman his accomplice, to bring them hither to conceal his &endq;crimes.</Q> At the&s;e words, my friends laid hold of them both, and it was now their turn to become pale and trembling; they looked on each other in &s;ilence, whil&s;t my companions interrogated them
<PB N="40" REF="40">with their drawn &s;words. I was glad to get into the &s;treet to recover my &s;en&s;es in a pure air, and perceiving your coach waiting at the door of the Vi&s;count, thought I would &s;tep in and a&s;k your advice, what ought to be done in this very extraordinary ca&s;e.</P>

He told the coachman
<PB N="46" REF="46">to &s;top &s;ome di&s;tance from the hou&s;e of his divinity, where he got out, &s;ent home his carriage, and arrived happily at the garden gate, which he fortunately found open, from thence he &s;oftly a&s;cended the &s;tairca&s;e, and knocked very gently at the door of Adelaide's apartment. He waited &s;ome minutes, at la&s;t the cham|ber maid, peeping thro' the key hole, whi&s;pered an enquiry of <Q>who was &startq;&endq;there? and what he wanted?</Q> when having received her an&s;wer, &s;he again left him, under no &s;mall degree of im|patience, and not a little &s;urpri&s;ed that he was &s;uffered to wait an in&s;tant after telling his name, which gave him &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the place was filled by another; at la&s;t he gained entrance, but his &s;u&s;picions made him &s;urvey the room with a very inqui&s;itive eye.

From this time Lord Warton and the Marquis became in&s;e|parable friends: the young Engli&s;hman was twenty-two years old, tall, well pro|portioned, with an air of dignity in his manner which made him an intere&s;ting figure, but his complection was &s;o ex|tremely fair, his eye &s;o blue, and his features &s;o delicate, that had not his
<PB N="59" REF="61">countenance been over&s;pread with a kind of manly ruddine&s;s, he might have pa&s;&s;ed for a woman; his hair, of which he had a profu&s;ion, appeared to be fair, but many affirmed it to be red when dive&s;ted of Marechale powder. The elegance of his dre&s;s was a proof that he &s;tudied fa|&s;hion with the nice&s;t exactne&s;s; and it was his particular plea&s;ure to excel in them to the mo&s;t eminent degree; as for wit, he had not by nature the &s;malle&s;t preten|&s;ions to any thing that wore the re&s;em|blance of it, yet, being a man of qua|lity, his mi&s;erable puns were laughed at, his <HI>bon-mots</HI> approved, and his &s;tories re|peated by his acquaintance; &s;o that upon the whole, he formed an opinion of him|&s;elf, as a very lively, clever, &s;en&s;ible, entertaining fellow.

<P>"AMSTERDAM could not be very agreeable to me, after having re|ceived &s;o &s;ignal an affront, and cho&s;e rather to leave it, than run the ri&s;que of the unpolite rebukes of his High Mightine&s;s; and &s;hould have quitted Holland directly, had I not heard that the Hague was a very agreeable re&s;i|dence for &s;trangers, and in every re|&s;pect worthy of my attention. I there|fore determined to go back and make &s;ome &s;tay at that rendezvous of the States General, mini&s;ters, and foreign Amba&s;&s;adors to the United Provinces.
<PB N="79" REF="83">The air of the Hague &s;eemed to purify me from the gro&s;&s;er particles of the &s;moke I had contracted in Am&s;terdam; and I no longer met &s;o continually tho&s;e little round, oily, fat people, with faces of &s;tupid &s;erenity.

Ever anxious to gain an early knowledge of the man|ners and cu&s;toms of the inhabitants of the principal towns, I went on the ve|ry fir&s;t evening of my arrival, to the play at the French Theatre, and was a&s;toni&s;hed to find a troop of comedi|ans,
<PB N="80" REF="84">who&s;e language is &s;carce under&s;tood, &s;hould draw together a much greater number of people than the actors of their own country: from this preference of the French players, I drew this in|ference, that the Dutch however &s;atur|nine by nature, yet have their whims and caprices; and that there are not any people &s;o ab&s;olutely unpoli&s;hed as not to be in &s;ome degree governed by fa|&s;hion. When I returned to my inn, I ordered &s;upper in my chamber, and was a&s;ked by my landlord, if I did not pre|fer &s;upping in company; I readily con|&s;ented, and he then introduced me into a large hall, where was a table with above thirty covers. I found my&s;elf not a little embarra&s;ed on being introduced to &s;uch a number of &s;trangers. I placed my&s;elf by the &s;ide of a young Dutch|man who had &s;at near me at the play,
<PB N="81" REF="85">and we &s;oon entered on the talents of the men, and intrigues of the women at the theatre. The ladies, I under&s;tood, were mo&s;tly maintained in a very expen&s;ive &s;tile by the rich merchants: thus I found the Seven United Provinces taking large &s;teps towards attaining the agree|able failings of politer nations. This kind of chat enabled me to bear with patience the amazing length of time we &s;at at table; at la&s;t the company ro&s;e, having fini&s;hed a pipe or two apiece, and as my new acquaintance and I re|tired to our chambers which were con|tiguous to each other, my compan$$$ ob&s;erved, that I &s;eemed melancholy; but that if I wi&s;hed for amu&s;ement, and travelled for information, he would the next day introduce me to a place, where I &s;hould &s;ee a&s;&s;embled mo&s;t of

<P>THE recital of Lord Warton's ad|ventures had di&s;&s;ipated the gloom which hung on the Marquis, who thank|ed him for the entertainment they had afforded him; he then left my lord, and went to &s;ee his tragic nymph play Zara.

<P>"MY pur&s;e was no &s;ooner empty than we were obliged from nece&s;&s;ity to return to Paris, and on my way thither I compo&s;ed a long &s;tory, &s;ufficient to in&s;pire my benevolent pro|tector with compa&s;&s;ion of <Q>my having &startq;been robbed in my way to La Trappe, and the dreadful mi&s;eries I had en|dured &endq;on my way back to Paris</Q>; but my &s;tudied eloquence was vain, and all the pains I had taken to give it an air of probability, thrown away, as I found his door ab&s;olutely &s;hut again&s;t me, and a me&s;&s;age left with the porter <Q>&startq;not to be &s;een there any more, if I &endq;valued my per&s;onal &s;afety.</Q> From this I was convinced that he was well
<PB N="319" REF="323">informed of the truth of my expedition, and did not dare to make any further application. Thus deprived of my only friend, without the lea&s;t re&s;ource, I thought it high time to con&s;ider how I &s;hould find means to pre&s;erve my mi&s;e|rable exi&s;tence; and being both tall and &s;trong for my age, I re&s;olved to enli&s;t into the army, and &s;oon after became a &s;oldier in a regiment then in garri&s;on at Rochelle, where I arrived &s;afely in company with the re&s;t of the recruits: here I formed an intimacy with a young man, who &s;hared my bed, and who did me a thou&s;and little &s;ervices, which I endeavoured to return on my part by all the means in my power, and we &s;oon became in&s;eparable companions. Two or three months after we came to Rochelle, my friend received an hun|dred louis from his father, (nearly all

Almo&s;t as &s;oon as he had entru&s;ted it to me, I formed a plan to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; in pur&s;uance of this I &s;lipt out unperceived, and buried the money in a very private place amid&s;t &s;ome bu&s;hes, which I took care to mark in &s;uch a manner that I could infallibly know it again, and then returned to my companions, who, far from &s;u&s;pecting the matter, a&s;ked me to go and drink, which I gladly complied with: we drank a good deal, and though I was in fact perfectly &s;ober, pretended to be the &s;oone&s;t intoxicated,
<PB N="321" REF="325">and they being nearly more than half drunk, we none of us returned to quar|ters, but lay down on a bench which was in the room.

<P>MADAME D'Illois, far from &s;u&s;|pecting the combination again&s;t her, was at this time involved in &s;ome dome&s;tic concerns, which were very un|expected, and which took up her whole attention.

<P>THE letter which brought this ac|count, contained not any other par|ticulars; but the reader's curio&s;ity may probably lead him to enquire, what could po&s;&s;ibly have been cau&s;e &s;ufficient to in|duce that man to draw a &s;word, who had &s;o often &s;ubmitted to bear the highe&s;t indignity that can be offered to an hu&s;band, without an attempt to re|venge the in&s;ult? Soon after the Marquis arrived at the army, he formed an ac|quaintance with a general officer, and they became in a very &s;hort time the mo&s;t intimate friends; however, Mon&s;. D'Illois (knowing that he was a man of univer&s;al gallantry, and that Julia's fidelity was not to be greatly relied on) kept with
<PB N="412" REF="416">unaccu&s;tomed prudence, both his mi&s;|tre&s;s and her abode from his knowledge; but the general had a &s;ervant, who&s;e only merit was &s;uch kind of di&s;cove|ries, and this man not only found out the whole &s;ecret, but carried &s;everal letters, and contrived matters &s;o well, that Julia received &s;everal vi&s;its from his ma&s;ter without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion.</P>
