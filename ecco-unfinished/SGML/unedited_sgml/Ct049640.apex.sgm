<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. SPEAKER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Ri&s;e, in acquittal of my engagement to the hou&s;e, in obedience to the &s;trong and ju&s;t re|qui&s;ition of my con&s;tituents, and, I am per&s;uaded, in conformity to the unanimous wi&s;hes of the whole nation, to &s;ubmit to the wi&s;dom of parlia|ment, "A plan of reform in the con&s;titution of &s;everal parts of the public oeconomy."</P>
<P>I have endeavoured, that this plan &s;hould in|clude in its execution, a con&s;iderable reduction of improper expence; that, it &s;hould effect a con|ver&s;ion of unprofitable titles into a productive e&s;tate; that, it &s;hould lead to, and indeed almo&s;t compel, a provident admini&s;tration of &s;uch &s;ums of public money as mu&s;t remain under di&s;cre|tionary tru&s;ts; that, it &s;hould render the incurring debts on the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment (which mu&s;t ultimately affect national &s;trength and national credit) &s;o very difficult, as to become next to impracticable.</P>
<P>But what, I confe&s;s, was uppermo&s;t with me, what I bent the whole force of my mind to, was
<PB N="2" REF="3">
the reduction of that corrupt influence, which is it&s;elf the perennial &s;pring of all prodigality, and of all di&s;order; which loads us, more than millions of debt; which takes away vigour from our arms, wi&s;dom from our councils, and every &s;hadow of authority and credit from the mo&s;t venerable parts of our con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Sir, I a&s;&s;ure you, very &s;olemnly, and with a very clear con&s;cience, that nothing in the world has led me to &s;uch an undertaking, but my zeal for the honour of this hou&s;e, and the &s;ettled, ha|bitual, &s;y&s;tematic affection I bear to the cau&s;e, and to the principles of government.</P>
<P>I enter perfectly into the nature and con&s;e|quences of my attempt; and I advance to it with a tremor that &s;hakes me to the inmo&s;t fibre of my frame. I feel, that I engage in a bu&s;ine&s;s, in it&s;elf mo&s;t ungracious, totally wide of the cour&s;e of prudent conduct; and I really think, the mo&s;t compleatly adver&s;e that can be ima|gined, to the natural turn and temper of my own mind. I know, that all par&s;imony is of a qua|lity approaching to unkindne&s;s; and that (on &s;ome per&s;on or other) every reform mu&s;t ope|rate as a &s;ort of puni&s;hment. Indeed the whole cla&s;s of the &s;evere and re&s;trictive virtues, are at a market almo&s;t too high for humanity. What is wor&s;e, there are very few of tho&s;e virtues which are not capable of being imitated, and even out|done in many of their mo&s;t &s;triking effects, by the wor&s;t of vices. Malignity and envy will carve much more deeply, and fini&s;h much more &s;harply, in the work of retrenchment, than frugality amd provi|dence. I do not, therefore, wonder that gentle|men have kept away from &s;uch a ta&s;k, as well from good nature as from prudence. Private feeling might, indeed, be overborne by legi&s;lative rea&s;on; and a man of a long-&s;ighted and &s;trong-nerved
<PB N="3" REF="4">
humanity, might bring him&s;elf, not &s;o much to con&s;ider from whom he takes a &s;uperfluous en|joyment, as for whom in the end he may pre|&s;erve the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>But it is much more ea&s;y to reconcile this mea&s;ure to humanity, than to bring it to any agree|ment with prudence. I do not mean that little, &s;elfi&s;h, pitiful, ba&s;tard thing, which &s;ometimes goes by the name of a family in which it is not legitimate, and to which it is a di&s;grace;&mdash;I mean even that public and enlarged prudence, which, apprehen&s;ive of being di&s;abled from ren|dering acceptable &s;ervices to the world, with|holds it&s;elf from tho&s;e that are invidious. Gen|tlemen who are, with me, verging towards the decline of life, and are apt to form their ideas of kings from kings of former times, might dread the anger of a reigning prince;&mdash;they who are more provident of the future, or by being young are more intere&s;ted in it, might tremble at the re&s;entment of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or; they might &s;ee a long, dull, dreary, unvaried vi&s;to of de&s;pair and exclu&s;ion, for half a century, before them. This is no plea|&s;ant pro&s;pect at the out&s;et of a political journey.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, Sir, the private enemies to be made in all attempts of this kind, are innumerable; and their enmity will be the more bitter, and the more dangerous too, becau&s;e a &s;en&s;e of dignity will oblige them to conceal the cau&s;e of their re&s;ent|ment. Very few men of great families and ex|ten&s;ive connections, but will feel the &s;mart of a cutting reform, in &s;ome clo&s;e relation, &s;ome bo|&s;om friend, &s;ome plea&s;ant acquaintance, &s;ome dear protected dependant. Emolument is taken from &s;ome; patronage from others; objects of pur|&s;uit from all. Men, forced into an involuntary independence, will abhor the authors of a ble&s;&s;ing which in their eyes has &s;o very near a re&s;em|blance to a cur&s;e. When officers are removed,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
and the offices remain, you may &s;et the gratitude of &s;ome again&s;t the anger of others; you may op|po&s;e the friends you oblige again&s;t the enemies you provoke. But &s;ervices of the pre&s;ent &s;ort create no attachments. The individual good felt in a public benefit, is comparatively &s;o &s;mall, comes round through &s;uch an involved labyrinth of intricate and tedious revolutions; whil&s;t a pre|&s;ent per&s;onal detriment is &s;o heavy where it falls, and &s;o in&s;tant in its operation, that the cold com|mendation of a public advantage never was, and never will be, a match for the quick &s;en&s;ibility of a private lo&s;s: and you may depend upon it, Sir, that when many people have an intere&s;t in railing, &s;ooner or later, they will bring a con|&s;iderable degree of unpopularity upon any mea|&s;ure. So that, for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t, the re|formation will operate again&s;t the reformers; and revenge (as again&s;t them at the lea&s;t) will pro|duce all the effects of corruption.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is almo&s;t always the ca&s;e, where the plan has compleat &s;ucce&s;s. But how &s;tands the matter in the mere attempt? Nothing, you know, is more common, than for men to wi&s;h, and call loudly too, for a reformation, who, when it ar|rives, do by no means like the &s;everity of its a&s;pect. Reformation is one of tho&s;e pieces which mu&s;t be put at &s;ome di&s;tance in order to plea&s;e. Its greate&s;t favourers love it better in the ab&s;tract than in the &s;ub&s;tance. When any old prejudice of their own, or any intere&s;t that they value, is touched, they become &s;crupulous, they become captious, and every man has his &s;eparate excep|tion. Some pluck out the black hairs, &s;ome the grey; one point mu&s;t be given up to one; ano|ther point mu&s;t be yielded to another; nothing is &s;uffered to prevail upon its own principle: the whole is &s;o frittered down, and disjointed, that
<PB N="5" REF="6">
&s;carcely a trace of the original &s;cheme remains! Thus, between the re&s;i&s;tance of power, and the un&s;y&s;tematical proce&s;s of popularity, the under|taker and the undertaking are both expo&s;ed, and the poor reformer is hi&s;&s;ed off the &s;tage, both by friends and foes.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, Sir, that the apology for my under|taking (an apology which, though long, is no longer than nece&s;&s;ary) is not grounded on my want of the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the difficult and invi|dious nature of the ta&s;k I undertake. I ri&s;que odium if I &s;ucceed, and contempt if I fail. My excu&s;e mu&s;t re&s;t in mine and your convic|tion of the ab&s;olute, urgent <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> there is, that &s;omething of the kind &s;hould be done. If there is any &s;acrifice to be made, either of e&s;ti|mation or of fortune, the &s;malle&s;t is the be&s;t. Commanders in chief are not to be put upon the forlorn hope. But indeed it is nece&s;&s;ary that the attempt &s;hould be made. It is nece&s;&s;ary from our own political circum&s;tances; it is nece&s;&s;ary from the operations of the enemy; it is nece&s;&s;ary from the demands of the people; who&s;e de&s;ires, when they do not militate with the &s;table and eternal rules of ju&s;tice and rea&s;on (rules which are above us, and above them) ought to be as a law to a Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>As to our circum&s;tances; I do not mean to ag|gravate the difficulties of them, by the &s;trength of any colouring what&s;oever. On the contrary, I ob&s;erve, and ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure, that our af|fairs rather wear a more promi&s;ing a&s;pect than they did on the opening of this &s;e&s;&s;ion. We have had &s;ome leading &s;ucce&s;&s;es. But tho&s;e who rate them at the highe&s;t (higher a great deal indeed than I dare to do) are of opinion, that, upon the ground of &s;uch advantages, we cannot at this time hope to make any treaty of peace, which
<PB N="6" REF="7">
would not be ruinous and completely di&s;graceful, In &s;uch an anxious &s;tate of things, if dawnings of &s;ucce&s;s &s;erve to animate our diligence, they are good; if they tend to increa&s;e our pre&s;umption, they are wor&s;e than defeats. The &s;tate of our af|fairs &s;hall then be as promi&s;ing as any one may choo&s;e to conceive it: It is however but promi&s;ing. We mu&s;t recollect, that with but half of our na|tural &s;trength, we are at war again&s;t confederated powers who have &s;ingly threatned us with ruin&punc; We mu&s;t recollect, that whil&s;t we are left naked on one &s;ide, our other flank is uncovered by any alliance; That whil&s;t we are weighing and balan|cing our &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t our lo&s;&s;es, we are accu|mulating debt to the amount of at lea&s;t fourteen millions in the year. That lo&s;s is certain.</P>
<P>I have no wi&s;h to deny, that our &s;ucce&s;&s;es are as brilliant as any one choo&s;es to make them; our re&s;ources too may, for me, be as unfathomable as they are repre&s;ented. Indeed they are ju&s;t whatever the people po&s;&s;e&s;s, and will &s;ubmit to pay. Taxing is an ea&s;y bu&s;ine&s;s. Any projector can contrive new impo&s;itions; any bungler can add to the old. But is it altogether wi&s;e to have no other bounds to your impo&s;itions, than the pa|tience of tho&s;e who are to bear them?</P>
<P>All I claim upon the &s;ubject of your re&s;ources is this, that they are not likely to be increa&s;ed by wa&s;ting them.&mdash;I think I &s;hall be permitted to a&s;|&s;ume, that a &s;y&s;tem of frugality will not le&s;&s;en your riches, whatever they may be;&mdash;I believe it will not be hotly di&s;puted, that tho&s;e re&s;ources which lie heavy on the &s;ubject, ought not to be objects of preference; that they ought not to be the <HI>very fir&s;t choice,</HI> to an hone&s;t repre&s;entative of the people.</P>
<P>This is all, Sir, that I &s;hall &s;ay upon our cir|cum&s;tances and our re&s;ources: I mean to &s;ay a
<PB N="7" REF="8">
little more on the operations of the enemy, be|cau&s;e this matter &s;eems to me very natural in our pre&s;ent deliberation. <Q>When I look to the other &s;ide of the water, I cannot help recollecting what Pyrrhus &s;aid on reconnoitering the Roman camp, &startq;The&s;e Barbarians have nothing barbarous in their di&s;cipline.&endq;</Q> When I look, as I have pretty carefully looked, into the proceedings of the French king, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, I &s;ee nothing of the character and genius of arbitrary finance; none of the bold frauds of bankrupt power; none of the wild &s;truggles, and plunges, of de&s;|poti&s;m in di&s;tre&s;s;&mdash;no lopping off from the ca|pital of debt;&mdash;no &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of intere&s;t;&mdash;no robbery under the name of loan;&mdash;no rai&s;ing the value, no deba&s;ing the &s;ub&s;tance of the coin. I &s;ee neither Louis the fourteenth, nor Louis the fifteenth. On the contrary, I behold with a&s;to|ni&s;hment, ri&s;ing before me, by the very hands of arbitrary power, and in the very mid&s;t of war and confu&s;ion, a regular, methodical &s;y&s;tem of public credit; I behold a fabric laid on the na|tural and &s;olid foundations of tru&s;t and confidence among men; and ri&s;ing, by fair gradations, or|der over order, according to the ju&s;t rules of &s;ymmetry and art. What a rever&s;e of things! Principle, method, regularity, oeconomy, fruga|lity, ju&s;tice to individuals, and care of the peo|ple, are the re&s;ources with which France makes war upon Great Britain. God avert the omen! But if we &s;hould &s;ee any genius in war and politics ari&s;e in France, to &s;econd what is done in the bureau!&mdash;I turn my eyes from the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The noble Lord in the blue ribbon, la&s;t year, treated all this with contempt. He never could conceive it po&s;&s;ible that the French mini&s;ter of finance could go through that year with a loan of but &s;eventeen hundred thou&s;and pounds; and that he &s;hould be able to fund that loan without any
<PB N="8" REF="9">
tax&punc; The &s;econd year, however, opens the very &s;ame &s;cene. A &s;mall loan, a loan of no more than two millions five hundred thou&s;and pounds, is to carry our enemies through the &s;ervice of this year al&s;o. No tax is rai&s;ed to fund that debt; no tax is rai&s;ed for the current &s;ervices. I am credibly informed that there is no anticipation what&s;oever. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This term comprehends various retributions made to per&s;ons who&s;e offices are taken away, or who, in any other way, &s;uffer by the new arrangements that are made.</NOTE> Compen&s;ations are correctly made. Old debts continue to be &s;unk as in the time of profound peace. Even payments which their trea&s;ury had been authorized to &s;u&s;pend during the time of war, are not &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>A general reform, executed through every <HI>de|partment of the revenue,</HI> creates an annual income of more than half a million, whil&s;t it facilitates and &s;implifies all the functions of admini&s;tration. The king's <HI>hou&s;ehold&mdash;</HI>at the remote&s;t avenues to which, all reformation has been hitherto &s;topped&mdash;that hou&s;ehold, which has been the &s;trong hold of pro|digality, the virgin fortre&s;s which was never be|fore attacked&mdash;has been not only not defended, but it has, even in the forms, been &s;urrendered by the king to the oeconomy of his mini&s;ter. No ca|pitulation; no re&s;erve. Oeconomy has entered in triumph into the public &s;plendour of the monarch, into his private amu&s;ements, into the appointments of his neare&s;t and highe&s;t relations. Oeconomy and public &s;pirit have made a beneficent and an hone&s;t &s;poil; they have plundered, from extrava|gance and luxury, for the u&s;e of &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ervice, a revenue of near four hundred thou&s;and pounds. The reform of the finances, joined to this reform of the court, gives to the public nine hundred thou&s;and pounds a year and upwards.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter who does the&s;e things is a great man&mdash;But the king who de&s;ires that they &s;hould be
<PB N="9" REF="10">
done, is a far greater. We mu&s;t do ju&s;tice to our enemies&mdash;The&s;e are the acts of a patriot king. I am not in dread of the va&s;t armies of France: I am not in dread of the gallant &s;pirit of its brave and nu|merous nobility: I am not alarmed even at the great navy which has been &s;o miraculou&s;ly cre|ated. All the&s;e things Louis the fourteenth had before. With all the&s;e things, the French mo|narchy has more than once fallen pro&s;trate at the feet of the public faith of Great Britain. It was the want of public credit which di&s;abled France from recovering after her defeats, or recovering even from her victories and triumphs. It was a prodigal court, it was an ill-ordered revenue, that &s;apped the foundations of all her greatne&s;s. Credit cannot exi&s;t under the arm of nece&s;&s;ity. Nece&s;&s;ity &s;trikes at credit, I allow, with a heavier and quicker blow under an arbitrary monarchy, than under a limited and balanced government: but &s;till nece&s;&s;ity and credit are natural enemies, and cannot be long reconciled in any &s;ituation. From nece&s;&s;ity and corruption, a free &s;tate may lo&s;e the &s;pirit of that complex con&s;titution which is the foundation of confidence. On the other hand, I am far from being &s;ure, that a monarchy, when once it is properly regulated, may not for a long time, furni&s;h a foundation for credit upon the &s;o|lidity of its maxims, though it affords no ground of tru&s;t in its in&s;titutions. I am afraid I &s;ee in England, and in France, &s;omething like a be|ginning of both the&s;e things. I wi&s;h I may be found in a mi&s;take.</P>
<P>This very &s;hort, and very imperfect &s;tate of what is now going on in France (the la&s;t circum|&s;tances of which I received in about eight days after the regi&s;try of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edict, regi&s;tered 29 Jan. 1780.</NOTE> edict) I do not, Sir, lay before you for any invidious purpo&s;e. It is in
<PB N="10" REF="11">
order to excite in us the &s;pirit of a noble emula|tion.&mdash;Let the nations make war upon each other (&s;ince we mu&s;t make war) not with a low and vul|gar malignity, but by a competition of virtues. This is the only way by which both parties can gain by war. The French have imitated us; let us, through them, imitate our&s;elves; our&s;elves in our better and happier days. If public fru|gality, under whatever men, or in whatever mode of government, is national &s;trength, it is a &s;trength which our enemies are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of before us.</P>
<P>Sir, I am well aware, that the &s;tate and the re&s;ult of the French oeconomy which I have laid before you, are even now lightly treated by &s;ome, who ought never to &s;peak but from information. Pains have not been &s;pared, to repre&s;ent them as impo&s;itions on the public. Let me tell you, Sir, that the creation of a navy, and a two years war without taxing, are a very &s;ingular &s;pecies of impo&s;ture. But be it &s;o. For what end does Neckar carry on this delu&s;ion? Is it to lower the e&s;timation of the crown he &s;erves, and to render his own admini&s;tration contemptible? No! No! He is con&s;cious, that the &s;en&s;e of mankind is &s;o clear and decided in favour of oeconomy, and of the weight and value of its re&s;ources, that he turns him&s;elf to every &s;pecies of fraud and ar|tifice, to obtain the meer reputation of it. Men do not affect a conduct that tends to their di&s;|credit. Let us, then, get the better of Mon&s;ieur Neckar in his own way&mdash;Let us do in reality what he does only in pretence&mdash;Let us turn his French tin&s;el into Engli&s;h gold. Is then the meer opinion and appearance of frugality and good management of &s;uch u&s;e to France, and is the &s;ub&s;tance to be &s;o mi&s;chievous to England? Is the very con&s;titution of nature &s;o altered by a &s;ea of twenty miles, that oeconomy &s;hould give power
<PB N="11" REF="12">
on the continent, and that profu&s;ion &s;hould give it here? For God's &s;ake let not this be the only fa&s;hion of France which we refu&s;e to copy.</P>
<P>To the la&s;t kind of nece&s;&s;ity, the de&s;ires of the people, I have but a very few words to &s;ay. The mini&s;ters &s;eem to conte&s;t this point; and affect to doubt, whether the people do really de&s;ire a plan of oeconomy in the civil government. Sir, this is too ridiculous. It is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould not de&s;ire it. It is impo&s;&s;ible that a pro|digality which draws its re&s;ources from their indigence, &s;hould be plea&s;ing to them. Little factions of pen&s;ioners, and their dependants, may talk another language. But the voice of nature is again&s;t them; and it will be heard. The peo|ple of England will not, they cannot take it kindly, that repre&s;entatives &s;hould refu&s;e to their con&s;tituents, what an ab&s;olute &s;overeign volun|tarily offers to his &s;ubjects. <Q>The expre&s;&s;ion of the petitions is, that <HI>&startq;before any new burthens are laid upon this country, effectual mea&s;ures be taken by this hou&s;e, to enquire into, and correct, the gro&s;s abu&s;es in the expenditure of public money.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
<P>This has been treated by the noble lord in the blue ribbon, as a wild factious language. It hap|pens, however, that the people in their addre&s;s to us, u&s;e almo&s;t word for word the &s;ame terms as the king of France u&s;es in addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his people; and it differs only, as it falls &s;hort of the French king's idea of what is due to his &s;ubjects. To convince, &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;our faithful &s;ubjects of <HI>the de&s;ire we entertain not to recur to new impo&s;itions,</HI> until we have fir&s;t exhau&s;ted all the re&s;ources which order and oeconomy can po&s;&s;ibly &s;upply.&endq;</Q>&mdash;&amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e de&s;ires of the people of England, which come far &s;hort of the voluntary conce&s;&s;ions of the king of France, are moderate indeed. They
<PB N="12" REF="13">
only contend that we &s;hould interweave &s;ome oeconomy with the taxes with which we have cho|&s;en to begin the war. They reque&s;t, not that you &s;hould rely upon oeconomy exclu&s;ively, but that you &s;hould give it rank and precedence, in the order of the ways and means of this &s;ingle &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But if it were po&s;&s;ible, that the de&s;ires of our con&s;tituents, de&s;ires which are at once &s;o natu|ral, and &s;o very much tempered and &s;ubdued, &s;hould have no weight with an hou&s;e of com|mons, which has its eye el&s;ewhere; I would turn my eyes to the very quarter to which theirs are directed. I would rea&s;on this matter with the hou&s;e, on the mere policy of the que&s;tion; and I would undertake to prove, that an early de|reliction of abu&s;e, is the direct intere&s;t of go|vernment, of government taken ab&s;tractedly from its duties, and con&s;idered merely as a &s;y&s;tem intending its own con&s;ervation.</P>
<P>If there is any one eminent criterion, which, above all the re&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;hes a wi&s;e government from an admini&s;tration weak and improvident, it is this;&mdash;<Q>&startq;well to know the be&s;t time and manner of yielding, what it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep.&endq;</Q>&mdash;There have been, Sir, and there are, many who chu&s;e to chicane with their &s;ituation, rather than be in&s;tructed by it. Tho&s;e gentlemen argue again&s;t every de&s;ire of reformation, upon the principles of a criminal pro&s;ecution. It is enough for them to ju&s;tify their adherence to a pernicious &s;y&s;tem, that it is not of their contrivance; that it is an inheritance of ab&s;urdity, derived to them from their ance&s;tors; that they can make out a long and unbroken pedigree of mi&s;managers that have gone before them. They are proud of the anti|quity of their hou&s;e; and they defend their errors, as if they were defending their inheritance:
<PB N="13" REF="14">
afraid of derogating from their nobility; and care|fully avoiding a &s;ort of blot in their &s;cutcheon, which they think would degrade them for ever.</P>
<P>It was thus that the unfortunate Charles the Fir&s;t defended him&s;elf on the practice of the Stuart who went before him, and of all the Tudors; his partizans might have gone to the Planta|genets.&mdash;They might have found bad examples enough, both abroad and at home, that could have &s;hewn an antient and illu&s;trious de&s;cent. But there is a time, when men will not &s;uffer bad things becau&s;e their ance&s;tors have &s;uffered wor&s;e. There is a time, when the hoary head of invete|rate abu&s;e, will neither draw reverence nor obtain protection. If the noble Lord in the blue ribbon pleads, <HI>"not guilty,"</HI> to the charges brought again&s;t the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of public oeconomy, it is not po&s;&s;ible to give a fair verdict by which he will not &s;tand acquitted. But pleading is not our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s. His plea or his traver&s;e may be allow|ed as an an&s;wer to a charge, when a charge is made. But if he puts him&s;elf in the way to ob|&s;truct reformation, then the faults of his office in&s;tantly become his own. In&s;tead of a public officer in an abu&s;ive department, who&s;e province is an object to be regulated, he becomes a cri|minal who is to be puni&s;hed. I do mo&s;t &s;eri|ou&s;ly put it to admini&s;tration, to con&s;ider the wi&s;dom of a timely reform. Early reformations are amicable arrangements with a friend in power: Late reformations are terms impo&s;ed upon a con|quered enemy; early reformations are made in cool blood; late reformations are made under a &s;tate of inflammation. In that &s;tate of things the people behold in government nothing that is re|&s;pectable. They &s;ee the abu&s;e, and they will &s;ee nothing el&s;e&mdash;They fall into the temper of a fu|rious populace provoked at the di&s;order of a hou&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="15">
of ill fame; they never attempt to correct or re|gulate; they go to work by the &s;horte&s;t way&mdash;They abate the nu&s;ance, they pull down the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This is my opinion with regard to the true intere&s;t of government. But as it is the intere&s;t of government that reformation &s;hould be early, it is the intere&s;t of the people that it &s;hould be temperate. It is their intere&s;t, becau&s;e a tem|perate reform is permanent; and becau&s;e it has a principle of growth. Whenever we improve, it is right to leave room for a further improvement. It is right to con&s;ider, to look about us, to exa|mine the effect of what we have done.&mdash;Then we can proceed with confidence, becau&s;e we can proceed with intelligence.&mdash;Whereas in hot reformations, in what men, more zealous than con&s;iderate, <HI>call making clear work,</HI> the whole is generally &s;o crude, &s;o har&s;h, &s;o indige&s;ted; mixed with &s;o much im|prudence, and &s;o much inju&s;tice; &s;o contrary to the whole cour&s;e of human nature and human in|&s;titutions, that the very people who are mo&s;t eager for it, are among the fir&s;t to grow di&s;gu&s;ted at what they have done. Then &s;ome part of the ab|dicated grievance is recalled from its exile in order to become a corrective of the correction. Then the abu&s;e a&s;&s;umes all the credit and popularity of a reform. The very idea of purity and di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s in politics falls into di&s;repute, and is con&s;idered as a vi&s;ion of hot and inexperienced men; and thus di&s;orders become incurable, not by the virulence of their own quality, but by the unapt and violent nature of the remedies. A great part therefore, of my idea of reform, is meant to operate gradually; &s;ome benefits will come at a nearer, &s;ome at a more remote period. We mu&s;t no more make ha&s;te to be rich by par&s;i|mony, than by intemperate acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>In my opinion, it is our duty when we have
<PB N="15" REF="16">
the de&s;ires of the people before us, to pur&s;ue them, not in the &s;pirit of literal obedience, which may militate with their very principle, much le&s;s to treat them with a peevi&s;h and contentious litiga|tion, as if we were adver&s;e parties in a &s;uit. It would, Sir, be mo&s;t di&s;honourable for a faithful repre&s;entative of the commons, to take advantage of any inartificial expre&s;&s;ion of the people's wi&s;hes, in order to fru&s;trate their attainment of what they have an undoubted right to expect. We are un|der infinite obligations to our con&s;tituents, who have rai&s;ed us to &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a tru&s;t, and have imparted &s;uch a degree of &s;anctity to com|mon characters. We ought to walk before them with purity, plainne&s;s, and integrity of heart; with filial love, and not with &s;lavi&s;h fear, which is always a low and tricking thing. For my own part, in what I have meditated upon that &s;ubject, I cannot indeed take upon me to &s;ay I have the honour <HI>to follow</HI> the &s;en&s;e of the people. The truth is, <HI>I met it on the way,</HI> while I was pur&s;uing their intere&s;t according to my own ideas. I am happy beyond expre&s;&s;ion, to find that my intentions have &s;o far coincided with theirs, that I have not had cau&s;e to be in the lea&s;t &s;crupulous to &s;ign their Petition, conceiving it to expre&s;s my own opinions, as nearly as general terms can expre&s;s the object of particular arrangements.</P>
<P>I am therefore &s;atisfied to act as a fair mediator between government and the people, endeavouring to form a plan which &s;hould have both an early and a temperate operation. I mean, that it &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tantial; that it &s;hould be &s;y&s;tematic. That it &s;hould rather &s;trike at the fir&s;t cau&s;e of prodi|gality and corrupt influence, than attempt to fol|low them in all their effects.</P>
<P>It was to fulfil the fir&s;t of the&s;e objects (the propo&s;al of &s;omething &s;ub&s;tantial) that I found
<PB N="16" REF="17">
my&s;elf obliged at the out-&s;et, to reject a plan propo&s;ed by an honourable and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Gilbert, E&s;&abque; member for Litchfield.</NOTE> attentive mem|ber of parliament, with very good intentions on his part, about a year or two ago. Sir, the plan I &s;peak of, was the tax of 25 <HI>per cent.</HI> moved upon places and pen&s;ions during the con|tinuance of the American war.&mdash;Nothing, Sir, could have met my ideas more than &s;uch a tax, if it was con&s;idered as a practical &s;atire on that war, and as a penalty upon tho&s;e who led us into it; but in any other view it appeared to me very liable to objections. I con&s;idered the &s;cheme as neither &s;ub&s;tantial, nor permanent, nor &s;y&s;tema|tical, nor likely to be a corrective of evil in|fluence. I have always thought employments a very proper &s;ubject of regulation, but a very ill|cho&s;en &s;ubject for a tax. An equal tax upon property is rea&s;onable; becau&s;e the object is of the &s;ame quality throughout. The &s;pecies is the &s;ame, it differs only in its quantity: but a tax upon &s;alaries is totally of a different nature; there can be no equality, and con&s;equently no ju&s;tice, in taxing them by the hundred, in the gro&s;s.</P>
<P>We have, Sir, on our e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;everal offices which perform real &s;ervice&mdash;We have al&s;o places that provide large rewards for no &s;ervice at all. We have &s;tations which are made for the public decorum; made for pre&s;erving the grace and maje&s;ty of a great people.&mdash;We have likewi&s;e expen&s;ive formalities, which tend rather to the di&s;grace than the ornament of the &s;tate and the court. This, Sir, is the real condition of our e&s;tabli&s;hments. To fall with the &s;ame &s;everity on objects &s;o perfectly di&s;&s;imilar, is the very rever&s;e of a reformation. I mean a reformation framed,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
as all &s;erious things ought to be, in number, weight, and mea&s;ure.&mdash;Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, that two men receive a &s;alary of &pound;. 800 a year each.&mdash;In the office of one, there is nothing at all to be done; in the other, the occupier is oppre&s;&s;ed by its duties.&mdash;Strike off twenty-five <HI>per cent.</HI> from the&s;e two offices, you take from one man &pound;. 200, which in ju&s;tice he ought to have, and you give in effect to the other &pound;. 600, which he ought not to receive. The public robs the former, and the latter robs the public; and this mode of mutual robbery is the only way in which the office and the public can make up their accounts.</P>
<P>But the balance in &s;ettling the account of this double inju&s;tice, is much again&s;t the &s;tate. The re&s;ult is &s;hort. You purcha&s;e a &s;aving of two hun|dred pounds, by a profu&s;ion of &s;ix. Be&s;ides, Sir, whil&s;t you leave a &s;upply of un&s;ecured money be|hind, wholly at the di&s;cretion of mini&s;ters, they make up the tax to &s;uch places as they wi&s;h to fa|vour, or in &s;uch new places as they may choo&s;e to create. Thus the civil li&s;t becomes oppre&s;&s;ed with debt; and the public is obliged to repay, and to repay with an heavy intere&s;t, what it has taken by an injudicious tax. Such has been the effect of the taxes hitherto laid on pen&s;ions and employ|ments, and it is no encouragement to recur again to the &s;ame expedient.</P>
<P>In effect, &s;uch a &s;cheme is not calculated to pro|duce, but to prevent reformation. It holds out a &s;hadow of pre&s;ent gain to a greedy and nece&s;&s;i|tous public, to divert their attention from tho&s;e abu&s;es, which in reality are the great cau&s;es of their wants. It is a compo&s;ition to &s;tay enquiry; it is a fine paid by mi&s;management, for the re|newal of its lea&s;e. What is wor&s;e, it is a fine paid by indu&s;try and merit, for an indemnity to the idle and the worthle&s;s. But I &s;hall &s;ay no more upon
<PB N="18" REF="19">
this topic, becau&s;e (whatever may be given out to the contrary) I know that the noble lord in the blue ribbon perfectly agrees with me in the&s;e &s;en|timents.</P>
<P>After all that I have &s;aid on this &s;ubject, I am &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that it is our duty to try every thing which may contribute to the relief of the nation, that I do not attempt wholly to reprobate the idea even of a tax. Whenever, Sir, the incumbrance of u&s;ele&s;s office (which lies no le&s;s a dead weight upon the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, than upon its reve|nues) &s;hall be removed;&mdash;when the remaining of|fices &s;hall be cla&s;&s;ed according to the ju&s;t propor|tion of their rewards and &s;ervices, &s;o as to admit the application of an equal rule to their taxation, when the di&s;cretionary power over the civil li&s;t ca&s;h &s;hall be &s;o regulated, that a mini&s;ter &s;hall no longer have the means of repaying with a private, what is taken by a public hand&mdash;if after all the&s;e preliminary regulations, it &s;hould be thought that a tax on places is an object worthy of the public attention, I &s;hall be very ready to lend my hand to a reduction of their emoluments.</P>
<P>Having thus, Sir, not &s;o much ab&s;olutely reject|ed, as po&s;tponed, the plan of a taxation of office,&mdash;my next bu&s;ine&s;s was to find &s;omething which might be really &s;ub&s;tantial and effectual. I am quite clear, that if we do not go to the very origin and fir&s;t ruling cau&s;e of grievances, we do no|thing. What does it &s;ignify to turn abu&s;es out of one door, if we are to let them in at another? What does it &s;ignify to promote oeconomy upon a mea&s;ure, and to &s;uffer it to be &s;ubverted in the principle? Our mini&s;ters are far from being wholly to blame for the pre&s;ent ill order which prevails. Whil&s;t in&s;titutions directly repugnant to good management, are &s;uffered to remain, no effectual or la&s;ting reform <HI>can</HI> be introduced.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
I therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary, as &s;oon as I conceived thoughts of &s;ubmitting to you &s;ome plan of reform, to take a comprehen&s;ive view of the &s;tate of this country; to make a &s;ort of &s;urvey of its Juri&s;dictions, its E&s;tates, and its E&s;tabli&s;h|ments. Something, in every one of them, &s;eemed to me to &s;tand in the way of all oeconomy in their admini&s;tration, and prevented every po&s;&s;ibility of methodizing the &s;y&s;tem. But being, as I ought to be, doubtful of my&s;elf, I was re&s;olved not to pro|ceed in an <HI>arbitrary</HI> manner, in any particular which tended to change the &s;ettled &s;tate of things, or in any degree to affect the fortune or &s;ituation, the intere&s;t or the importance, of any individual. By an arbitrary proceeding, I mean one conducted by the private opinions, ta&s;tes, or feelings, of the man who attempts to regulate. The&s;e private mea&s;ures are not &s;tandards of the exchequer, nor balances of the &s;anctuary. General principles can|not be debauched or corrupted by intere&s;t or ca|price; and by tho&s;e principles I was re&s;olved to work.</P>
<P>Sir, before I proceed further, I will lay the&s;e principles fairly before you, that afterwards you may be in a condition to judge whether every ob|ject of regulation, as I propo&s;e it, comes fairly un|der its rule. This will exceedingly &s;horten all di&s;cu&s;&s;ion between us, if we are perfectly in ear|ne&s;t in e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;y&s;tem of good management. I therefore lay down to my&s;elf, &s;even fundamen|tal rules; they might indeed be reduced to two or three &s;imple maxims, but they would be too gene|ral, and their application to the &s;everal heads of the bu&s;ine&s;s, before us, would not be &s;o di&s;tinct and vi&s;ible. I conceive then,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That all juri&s;dictions which furni&s;h more matter of expence, more tempta|tion to oppre&s;&s;ion, or more means and
<PB N="20" REF="21">
in&s;truments of corrupt influence, than advantage to ju&s;tice or political ad|mini&s;tration, ought to be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That all public e&s;tates which are more &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of vex|ing, overawing, and influencing tho&s;e who hold under them, and to the ex|pence of perception and management, than of benefit to the revenue, ought, upon every principle, both of revenue and of freedom, to be di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That all offices which bring more charge than proportional advantage to the &s;tate; that all offices which may be engrafted on others, uniting and &s;im|plifying their duties, ought, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, to be taken away; and in the &s;e|cond, to be con&s;olidated.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That all &s;uch offices ought to be aboli&s;hed as ob&s;truct the pro&s;pect of the general &s;uperintendant of finance; which de&s;troy his &s;uperintendancy, which di&s;|able him from fore&s;eeing and providing for charges as they may occur; from pre|venting expence in its origin, checking it in its progre&s;s, or &s;ecuring its appli|cation to its proper purpo&s;es. A mi|ni&s;ter under whom expences can be made without his knowledge, can never &s;ay what it is that he can &s;pend or what it is that he can &s;ave.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That it is proper to e&s;tabli&s;h an invariable order in all payments; which will prevent partiality; which will give preference to &s;ervices, not according to the importunity of the demandant, but the rank and order of their utility or their ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
<HI>Sixthly,</HI> That it is right to reduce every e&s;tabli&s;hment, and every part of an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment (as nearly as po&s;&s;ible) to cer|tainty, the life of all order and good management.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> That all &s;ubordinate trea&s;uries, as the nur&s;eries of mi&s;management, and as naturally drawing to them&s;elves as much money as they can, keeping it as long as they can, and accounting for it as late as they can, ought to be di&s;|&s;olved. They have a tendency to per|plex and di&s;tract the public accounts, and to excite a &s;u&s;picion of govern|ment, even beyond the extent of their abu&s;e.</P>
<P>Under the authority and with the guidance of tho&s;e principles, I proceed; wi&s;hing that nothing in any e&s;tabli&s;hment may be changed, where I am not able to make a &s;trong, direct, and &s;olid appli|cation of tho&s;e principles, or of &s;ome one of them. An oeconomical con&s;titution is a nece&s;&s;ary ba&s;is for an oeconomical admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, with regard to the &s;overeign juri&s;dictions, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, Sir, that whoever takes a view of this kingdom in a cur&s;ory manner, will ima|gine, that he beholds a &s;olid, compacted, uniform &s;y&s;tem of monarchy; in which all inferior juri&s;|dictions are but as rays diverging from one center. But on examining it more nearly, you find much excentricity and confu&s;ion. It is not a <HI>Monarchy</HI> in &s;trictne&s;s. But, as in the Saxon times this country was an heptarchy, it is now a &s;trange &s;ort of <HI>Pentarchy.</HI> It is divided into five &s;everal di&s;|tinct principalities, be&s;ides the &s;upreme. There is indeed this difference from the Saxon times, that as in the itinerant exhibitions of the &s;tage, for want of a complete company, they are obliged to ca&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="23">
a variety of parts on their chief performer; &s;o our &s;overeign conde&s;cends him&s;elf to act, not only the principal, but all the &s;ubordinate parts in the play. He conde&s;cends to di&s;&s;ipate the royal character, and to trifle with tho&s;e light, &s;ubordinate, lackered &s;ceptres, in tho&s;e hands that &s;u&s;tain the ball repre&s;enting the world, or which wield the tri|dent that commands the ocean. Cro&s;s a brook, and you lo&s;e the king of England; but you have &s;ome comfort in coming again under his maje&s;ty, though "&s;horn of his beams," and no more than Prince of Wales. Go to the north, and you find him dwindled to a Duke of Lanca&s;ter; turn to the we&s;t of that north, and he pops upon you in the humble character of Earl of Che&s;ter. Travel a few miles on, the Earl of Che&s;ter di&s;appears; and the king &s;urpri&s;es you again as Count Pala|tine of Lanca&s;ter. If you travel beyond Mount Edgecombe, you find him once more in his in|cognito, and He is Duke of Cornwall. So that, quite fatigued and &s;atiated with this dull variety, you are infinitely refre&s;hed when you return to the &s;phere of his proper &s;plendor, and behold your amiable &s;overeign in his true, &s;imple, undi&s;|gui&s;ed, native character of maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In every one of the&s;e five Principalities, Dutchies, Palatinates, there is a regular e&s;tabli&s;hment of con&s;iderable expence, and mo&s;t domineering in|fluence. As his maje&s;ty &s;ubmits to appear in this &s;tate of &s;ubordination to him&s;elf, &s;o his loyal peers and faithful commons attend his royal transforma|tions; and are not &s;o nice as to refu&s;e to nibble at tho&s;e crumbs of emoluments, which con&s;ole their petty metamorpho&s;es. Thus every one of the&s;e principalities has the apparatus of a kingdom, for the juri&s;diction over a few private e&s;tates; and the formality and charge of the exchequer of Great Britain, for collecting the rents of a country
<PB N="23" REF="24">
&s;quire. Cornwall is the be&s;t of them; but when you compare the charge with the receipt, you will find that it furni&s;hes no exception to the general rule. The dutchy and county palatine of Lanca&s;ter do not yield, as I have rea&s;on to believe, on an average of twenty years, four thou&s;and pounds a year, clear to the crown. As to Wales, and the county palatine of Che&s;ter, I have my doubts, whether their productive ex|chequer yields any returns at all. Yet one may &s;ay, that this revenue is more faithfully applied to its purpo&s;es than any of the re&s;t; as it exi&s;ts for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of multiplying offices, and extending influence.</P>
<P>An attempt was lately made to improve this branch of local influence, and to transfer it to the fund of general corruption. I have on the &s;eat behind me, the con&s;titution of Mr. John Probert; a knight-errant, dubbed by the noble lord in the blue ribbon, and &s;ent to &s;earch for revenues and adventures upon the mountains of Wales. The commi&s;&s;ion is remarkable; and the event not le&s;s &s;o. <Q>The commi&s;&s;ion &s;ets forth, that &startq;Upon a report of the <HI>deputy au|ditor</HI> (for there is a deputy auditor) of the principality of Wales, it appeared, that his maje&s;ty's land-revenues in the &s;aid principality, <HI>are greatly dimini&s;hed;&mdash;&endq;</HI></Q> and <Q>&startq;that upon a <HI>re|port</HI> of the <HI>&s;urveyor general</HI> of his maje&s;ty's land revenues, upon a <HI>memorial</HI> of the auditor of his maje&s;ty's revenues <HI>within the &s;aid principality,</HI> that his mines and fore&s;ts have produced very <HI>little profit either to the public revenue or to indi|viduals;&endq;</HI></Q>&mdash;and therefore they appoint Mr. Probert, with a pen&s;ion of three hundred pounds a year from the &s;aid principality, to try whether he can make any thing more of that very <HI>little</HI> which is &s;tated to be &s;o <HI>greatly</HI> dimini&s;hed. <Q><HI>&startq;A
<PB N="24" REF="25">
beggarly account of empty boxes.&endq;</HI></Q> And yet, Sir, you will remark&mdash;that this diminution from lit|tlene&s;s (which &s;erves only to prove the infinite divi&s;ibility of matter) was not for want of the tender and officious care (as we &s;ee) of &s;urveyors general, and &s;urveyors particular; of auditors and deputy-auditors; not for want of memorials, and remon&s;trances, and reports, and commi&s;&s;ions, and con&s;titutions, and inqui&s;itions, and pen|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Probert, thus armed, and accountred,&mdash;and paid, proceeded on his adventure;&mdash;but he was no &s;ooner arrived on the confines of Wales, than all Wales was in arms to meet him. That na|tion is brave, and full of &s;pirit. Since the in|va&s;ion of king Edward, and the ma&s;&s;acre of the bards, there never was &s;uch a tumult, and alarm, and uproar, through the region of <HI>Pre&s;tatyn. Snowden</HI> &s;hook to its ba&s;e; <HI>Cader Edris</HI> was loo&s;ened from its foundations. The fury of litigious war blew her horn on the mountains. The rocks poured down their goatherds, and the deep caverns vomited out their miners. Every thing above ground, and every thing under ground, was in arms.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir, to alight from my Wel&s;h Pega&s;us, and to come to level ground; the <HI>Preux Chevalier</HI> Probert went to look for revenue, like his ma&s;ters upon other occa&s;ions; and like his ma&s;ters, he found rebellion. But we were grown cautious by experience. A civil war of paper might end in a more &s;erious war; for now remon&s;trance met re|mon&s;trance, and memorial was oppo&s;ed to memo|rial. In truth, Sir, the attempt was no le&s;s an af|front upon the under&s;tanding of that re&s;pectable people, than it was an attack on their property. The wi&s;e Britons thought it more rea&s;onable, that the poor, wa&s;ted, decrepit revenue of the principality,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
&s;hould die a natural than a violent death. They cho&s;e that their ancient mo&s;s-grown ca&s;tles, &s;hould moul|der into decay, under the &s;ilent touches of time, and the &s;low formality of an oblivious and drow&s;y exchequer, than that they &s;hould be battered down all at once, by the lively efforts of a pen|&s;ioned engineer. As it is the fortune of the no|ble lord to whom the au&s;pices of this campaign belonged, frequently to provoke re&s;i&s;tance, &s;o it is his rule and his nature to yield to that re&s;i&s;tance <HI>in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</HI> He was true to him&s;elf on this occa&s;ion. He &s;ubmitted with &s;pirit to the &s;pirited remon&s;trances of the Welch. <Q>Mr. Pro|bert gave up his adventure, and keeps his pen|&s;ion&mdash;and &s;o ends &startq;the famous hi&s;tory of the revenue adventures of the bold Baron North, and the good Knight Probert, upon the moun|tains of Venodotia.&endq;</Q></P>

They are exchequers of unfrequent receipt, and con|&s;tant charge; a &s;y&s;tem of finances not fit for an oeconomi&s;t who would be rich; not fit for a prince who would govern his &s;ubjects with equity and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It is not only between prince and &s;ubject, that the&s;e mock juri&s;dictions, and mimic revenues, pro|duce great mi&s;chief. They excite among the peo|ple a &s;pirit of informing, and delating; a &s;pirit of &s;upplanting and undermining one another. So that many in &s;uch circum&s;tances, conceive it ad|vantageous to them, rather to continue &s;ubject to vexation them&s;elves, than to give up the means and chance of vexing others. It is exceedingly common for men to contract their love to their country, into an attachment to its petty &s;ubdivi|&s;ions; and they &s;ometimes even cling to their pro|vincial abu&s;es, as if they were franchi&s;es, and local privileges. Accordingly, in places where there is much of this kind of e&s;tate, per&s;ons will be always found, who would rather tru&s;t to their talents in recommending them&s;elves to power for the renewal of their intere&s;ts, than to incumber their pur&s;es, though never &s;o lightly, in order to tran&s;mit independence to their po&s;terity. It is a great mi&s;take, that the de&s;ire of &s;ecuring property is univer&s;al among mankind. Gaming is a prin|ciple inherent in human nature. It belongs to us all. I would therefore break tho&s;e tables; I would furni&s;h no evil occupation for that &s;pirit. I would make every man look every where, ex|cept to the intrigue of a court, for the improve|ment of his circum&s;tances, or the &s;ecurity of his fortune. I have in my eye a very &s;trong ca&s;e in the dutchy of Lanca&s;ter (which lately occupied

<P>For what plau&s;ible rea&s;on are the&s;e principali|ties &s;uffered to exi&s;t? When a government is ren|dered complex (which in it&s;elf is no de&s;irable thing) it ought to be for &s;ome political end, which cannot be an&s;wered otherwi&s;e. Subdivi&s;ions in government, are only admi&s;&s;ible in favour of the dignity of inferior princes, and high nobility; or for the &s;upport of an ari&s;tocratic confederacy un|der &s;ome head; or for the con&s;ervation of the franchi&s;es of the people in &s;ome privileged pro|vince. Such, for the two former of the&s;e ends, are the &s;ubdivi&s;ions in favour of the electoral, and other princes in the empire; for the latter of the&s;e purpo&s;es, are the juri&s;dictions of the imperial ci|ties, and the Han&s;e towns. For the latter of the&s;e ends, are al&s;o the countries of the States <HI>[Pais d'Etats]</HI> and certain cities, and orders in France. The&s;e are all regulations with an object, and &s;ome of them with a very good object. But how are the principles of any of the&s;e &s;ubdivi&s;ions applicable in the ca&s;e before us?</P>
<P>Do they an&s;wer any purpo&s;e to the king? The principality of Wales was given by patent to Edward the Black Prince, on the ground on which it has &s;tood ever &s;ince.&mdash;Lord Coke &s;agaciou&s;ly ob|&s;erves upon it, <Q>&startq;That in the charter of creating the Black Prince Edward prince of Wales, there is a <HI>great my&s;tery&mdash;</HI>for <HI>le&s;s</HI> than an e&s;|tate of inheritance, &s;o <HI>great</HI> a prince <HI>could</HI> not have, and an <HI>ab&s;olute e&s;tate of inheritance</HI> in &s;o <HI>great</HI> a principality as Wales (this principality being <HI>&s;o dear</HI> to him) he <HI>&s;hould</HI> not have; and
<PB N="28" REF="29">
therefore it was made, <HI>&s;ibi et heredibus &s;uis regi|bus Angliae,</HI> that by his decea&s;e, or attaining to the crown, it might be extingui&s;hed in the crown.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>For the &s;ake of this fooli&s;h <HI>my&s;tery,</HI> of what a great prince <HI>could</HI> not have <HI>le&s;s,</HI> and <HI>&s;hould</HI> not have <HI>&s;o much,</HI> of a principality which was too <HI>dear</HI> to be given, and too <HI>great</HI> to be kept&mdash;and for no other cau&s;e, that ever I could find&mdash;this form and &s;ha|dow of a principality without any &s;ub&s;tance, has been maintained. That you may judge in this in&s;tance (and it &s;erves for the re&s;t) of the differ|ence between a great and a little oeconomy, you will plea&s;e to recollect, Sir, that Wales may be about the tenth part of England in &s;ize and popu|lation; and certainly not a hundredth part in opu|lence. Twelve judges perform the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s, both of the &s;tationary and the itinerant ju&s;tice of this kingdom; but for Wales, there are eight judges. There is in Wales an exchequer, as well as in all the dutchies, according to the very be&s;t and mo&s;t authentic ab&s;urdity of form. There are in all of them, a hundred more difficult trifles and laborious fooleries, which &s;erve no other pur|po&s;e than to keep alive corrupt hope and &s;ervile dependence.</P>
<P>The&s;e principalities are &s;o far from contributing to the ea&s;e of the king, to his wealth, or his dig|nity, that they render both his &s;upreme and his &s;ubordinate authority, perfectly ridiculous. It was but the other day, that that pert, factious fel|low, the duke of Lanca&s;ter, pre&s;umed to fly in the face of his liege lord, our gracious &s;overeign; and <HI>a&s;&s;ociating</HI> with a parcel of lawyers as factious as him&s;elf, to the de&s;truction of <HI>all law and order,</HI> and <HI>in committees leading directly to rebellion&mdash;</HI>pre&s;umed to go to law with the king. The ob|ject
<PB N="29" REF="30">
is neither your bu&s;ine&s;s, nor mine. Which of the parties got the better, I really forget. I think it was (as it ought to be) the king. The mate|rial point is, that the &s;uit co&s;t about fifteen thou|&s;and pounds. But as the duke of Lanca&s;ter is but a &s;ort of <HI>duke Humphrey,</HI> and not worth a groat, our &s;overeign was obliged to pay the co&s;ts of both. Indeed this art of converting a great monarch into a little prince, this royal ma&s;querading, is a very dangerous and expen&s;ive amu&s;ement; and one of the king's <HI>menus plai&s;irs,</HI> which ought to be reform|ed. This dutchy, which is not worth four thou|&s;and pounds a year at be&s;t, to <HI>revenue,</HI> is worth forty or fifty thou&s;and to <HI>influence.</HI></P>
<P>The dutchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and the county pala|tine of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> an&s;wered, I admit, &s;ome pur|po&s;e in their original creation. They tended to make a &s;ubject imitate a prince. When <HI>Henry the fourth</HI> from that &s;tair a&s;cended the throne, high-minded as he was, he was not willing to kick away the ladder. To prevent that prin|cipality from being extingui&s;hed in the crown, he &s;evered it by act of parliament. He had a mo|tive, &s;uch as it was; he thought his title to the crown un&s;ound, and his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in&s;ecure. He therefore managed a retreat in his dutchy; which <HI>lord Coke</HI> calls (I do not know why) <HI>par multis regnis.</HI> He flattered him&s;elf that it was practica|ble to make a projecting point half way down, to break his fall from the precipice of royalty; as if it were po&s;&s;ible for one who had lo&s;t a king|dom to keep any thing el&s;e. However, it is evident that he thought &s;o. When <HI>Henry the fifth</HI> united, by act of parliament, the e&s;tates of his mother to the dutchy, he had the &s;ame predi|lection with his father, to the root of his fa|mily honours, and the &s;ame policy in enlarging
<PB N="30" REF="31">
the &s;phere of a po&s;&s;ible retreat from the &s;lippery royalty of the two great crowns he held. All this was changed by <HI>Edward the fourth.</HI> He had no &s;uch family partialities, and his policy was the rever&s;e of that of Henry the fourth and Henry the fifth. He accordingly again united the dutchy of Lanca&s;ter to the crown. But when <HI>Henry the &s;eventh,</HI> who cho&s;e to con&s;ider him&s;elf as of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, came to the throne, he brought with him the old preten&s;ions, and the old politics of that hou&s;e. A new act of parliament, a &s;econd time, di&s;&s;evered the dutchy of Lanca&s;ter from the crown; and in that line things continued until the &s;ubver&s;ion of the monarchy, when principa|lities and powers fell along with the throne. The dutchy of Lanca&s;ter mu&s;t have been extingui&s;hed, if <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who began to form ideas of aggran|dizing his hou&s;e, and rai&s;ing the &s;everal branches of it, had not cau&s;ed the dutchy to be again &s;e|parated from the commonwealth, by an act of the parliament of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>What partiality, what objects of the politics of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, or of Cromwell, has his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, or his maje&s;ty's family? What power have they within any of the&s;e prin|cipalities, which they have not within their king|dom? In what manner is the dignity of the no|bility concerned in the&s;e principalities? What rights have the &s;ubject there, which they have not at lea&s;t equally in every other part of the nation. The&s;e di&s;tinctions exi&s;t for no good end to the king, to the nobility, or to the people. They ought not to exi&s;t at all. If the crown (contrary to its nature, but mo&s;t conformably to the whole tenor of the advice that has been lately given) &s;hould &s;o far forget its dignity, as to contend, that the&s;e juri&s;dictions and revenues are e&s;tates of private property, I am rather for acting as if that
<PB N="31" REF="32">
groundle&s;s claim were of &s;ome weight, than for giving up that e&s;&s;ential part of the reform. I would value the clear income, and give a clear annuity to the crown, taken on the medium pro|duce for twenty years.</P>
<P>If the crown has any favourite name or title, if the &s;ubject has any matter of local accommodation within any of the&s;e juri&s;dictions, it is meant to pre|&s;erve them; and to improve them, if any improve|ment can be &s;ugge&s;ted. As to the crown rever|&s;ions or titles upon the property of the people there, it is propo&s;ed to convert them from a &s;nare to their independance, into a relief from their bur|thens. I propo&s;e, therefore, to unite all the five principalities to the crown, and to its ordinary juri&s;diction, to aboli&s;h all tho&s;e offices that pro|duce an u&s;ele&s;s and chargeable &s;eparation from the body of the people,&mdash;to compen&s;ate tho&s;e who do not hold their offices (if any &s;uch there are) at the plea&s;ure of the crown,&mdash;to extingui&s;h vexatious titles by an act of &s;hort limitation,&mdash;to &s;ell tho&s;e unprofitable e&s;tates which &s;upport u&s;ele&s;s juri&s;dictions, and to turn the tenant-right into a fee, on &s;uch moderate terms as will be better for the &s;tate than its pre&s;ent right, and which it is impo&s;&s;ible for any rational tenant to refu&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the Dutchies, their judicial oeconomy may be provided for without charge. They have only to fall of cour&s;e into the common county admi|ni&s;tration. A commi&s;&s;ion more or le&s;s made or omitted, &s;ettles the matter fully. As to Wales, it has been propo&s;ed to add a judge to the &s;everal courts of We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall; and it has been con|&s;idered as an improvement in it&s;elf. For my part, I cannot pretend to &s;peak upon it with clearne&s;s or with deci&s;ion; but certainly this arrangement would be more than &s;ufficient for Wales. My
<PB N="32" REF="33">
original thought was to &s;uppre&s;s five of the eight judges; and to leave the chief ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter, with the two &s;enior judges; and, to facilitate the bu&s;ine&s;s, to throw the twelve counties into &s;ix di&s;tricts, holding the &s;e&s;&s;ions alternately in the counties of which each di&s;trict &s;hall be compo&s;ed. But on this I &s;hall be more clear, when I come to the particular bill.</P>
<P>Sir, the hou&s;e will now &s;ee whether, in praying for judgment again&s;t the minor principalities, I do not act in conformity to the laws that I had laid down to my&s;elf, of getting rid of every juri&s;diction more &s;ub&s;ervient to oppre&s;&s;ion and expence, than to any end of ju&s;tice or hone&s;t policy; of aboli&s;hing offices more expen&s;ive than u&s;eful; of combining duties improperly &s;eparated; of changing revenues more vexatious than productive, into ready money; of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing offices which &s;tand in the way of oeco|nomy; and of cutting off lurking fubordinate trea&s;uries. Di&s;pute the rules; controvert the ap|plication; or give your hands to this &s;alutary mea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the &s;ame rules will be found appli|cable to my &s;econd object<HI>&mdash;the landed e&s;tate of the crown.</HI> A landed e&s;tate is certainly the very wor&s;t which the crown can po&s;&s;e&s;s. All minute and di&s;per&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions that are often of indeterminate value, and which require a con|tinued per&s;onal attendance, are of a nature more proper for private management, than public admi|ni&s;tration.&mdash;They are fitter for the care of a frugal land &s;teward, than of an office in the &s;tate. What|ever they may po&s;&s;ibly have been in other times, or in other countries, they are not of magnitude enough with us, to occupy a public department, nor to provide for a public object. They are al|ready given up to parliament, and the gift is not of great value. Common prudence dictates, even
<PB N="33" REF="34">
in the management of private affairs, that all di&s;|per&s;ed and chargeable e&s;tates, &s;hould be &s;acrificed to the relief of e&s;tates more compact and better circum&s;tanced.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that the&s;e lands at pre&s;ent would &s;ell at a low market; this is an&s;wered, by &s;hewing that money is at high price. The one balances the other. Lands &s;ell at the current rate, and nothing can &s;ell for more. But be the price what it may, a great object is always an&s;wered, whenever any property is transferr'd from hands that are not fit for that property, to tho&s;e that are. The buyer and &s;eller mu&s;t mutually profit by &s;uch a bargain; and, what rarely happens in matters of revenue, the relief of the &s;ubject will go hand in hand with the profit of the exchequer.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>fore&s;t lands,</HI> in which the Crown has (where they are not granted or pre&s;criptively held) the <HI>dominion</HI> of the <HI>&s;oil,</HI> and the <HI>vert</HI> and <HI>veni&s;on;</HI> that is to &s;ay, the timber and the game, and in which the people have a variety of rights, in com|mon of herbage, and other commons, according to the u&s;age of the &s;everal fore&s;ts;&mdash;I propo&s;e to have tho&s;e rights of the crown valued as ma|nerial rights are valued on an inclo&s;ure; and a defined portion of land to be given for them; which land is to be &s;old for the public benefit.</P>
<P>As to the timber, I propo&s;e a &s;urvey of the whole. What is u&s;ele&s;s for the naval purpo&s;es of the kingdom, I would condemn, and di&s;po&s;e of, for the &s;ecurity of what may be u&s;eful; and to inclo&s;e &s;uch other parts as may be mo&s;t fit to furni&s;h a perpetual &s;upply; wholly extingui&s;h|ing, for a very obvious rea&s;on, all right of <HI>veni&s;on</HI> in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The fore&s;t <HI>rights</HI> which extend over the lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of others, being of no profit to the crown, and a grievance, as far as it goes, to the
<PB N="34" REF="35">
&s;ubject; the&s;e I propo&s;e to extingui&s;h without charge to the proprietors. The &s;everal commons are to be allotted and compen&s;ated for upon ideas which I &s;hall hereafter explain. They are nearly the &s;ame with the principles upon which you have acted in private inclo&s;ures. I &s;hall never quit precedents where I find them applicable. For tho&s;e regulations and compen&s;ations, and for every other part of the detail, you will be &s;o indulgent as to give me credit for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The revenue to be obtained from the &s;ale of the fore&s;t lands and rights, will not be &s;o con&s;i|derable, I believe, as many people have ima|gined; and I conceive it would be unwi&s;e to &s;crew it up to the utmo&s;t, or even to &s;uffer bidders to inhance, according to their eagerne&s;s, the pur|cha&s;e of objects, wherein the expence of that purcha&s;e may weaken the capital to be employed in their cultivation. This, I am well aware, might give room for partiality in the di&s;po&s;al. In my opinion it would be the le&s;&s;er evil of the two. But I really conceive, that a rule of fair prefe|rence might be e&s;tabli&s;hed, which would take away all &s;ort of unju&s;t and corrupt partiality. The principal revenue which I propo&s;e to draw from the&s;e uncultivated wa&s;tes, is to &s;pring from the improvement and population of the kingdom; which never can happen, without producing an im|provement more advantageous to the revenues of the crown, than the rents of the be&s;t landed e&s;tate which it can hold. I believe, Sir, it will hardly be nece&s;&s;ary for me to add, that in this &s;ale I na|turally except all the hou&s;es, gardens, and parks belonging to the crown, and &s;uch one fore&s;t as &s;hall be cho&s;en by his maje&s;ty, as be&s;t accommo|dated to his plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>By means of this part of the reform, will fall the expen&s;ive office of <HI>&s;urveyor general,</HI> with all
<PB N="35" REF="36">
the influence that attends it. By this, will fall <HI>two chief ju&s;tices in Eyre,</HI> with all their train of dependents. You need be under no apprehen&s;ion, Sir, that your office is to be touched in its emolu|ments. They are yours by law; and they are but a moderate part of the compen&s;ation which is given to you for the ability with which you exe|cute an office of quite another &s;ort of importance: it is far from overpaying your diligence; or more than &s;ufficient for &s;u&s;taining the high rank you &s;tand in, as the fir&s;t gentleman of England. As to the duties of your chief ju&s;tice&s;hip, they are very different from tho&s;e for which you have re|ceived the office. Your dignity is too high for a juri&s;diction over wild bea&s;ts; and your learn|ing and talents too valuable to be wa&s;ted as chief ju&s;tice of a de&s;ert. I cannot reconcile it to my|&s;elf, that you, Sir, &s;hould be &s;tuck up as a u&s;ele&s;s piece of antiquity.</P>
<P>I have now di&s;po&s;ed of the unprofitable land|ed e&s;tates of the crown, and thrown them into the ma&s;s of private property; by which they will come, through the cour&s;e of circulation, and through the political &s;ecretions of the &s;tate, into our better under&s;tood and better ordered reve|nues.</P>
<P>I come next to the great &s;upreme body of the civil government it&s;elf. I approach it with that awe and reverence with which a young phy&s;ician approaches to the cure of the di&s;orders of his pa|rent. Di&s;orders, Sir, and infirmities, there are&mdash;&s;uch di&s;orders, that all attempts towards method, prudence, and frugality, will be perfectly vain, whil&s;t a &s;y&s;tem of confu&s;ion remains, which is not only alien but adver&s;e to all oeconomy; a &s;y&s;tem, which is not only prodigal in its very e&s;&s;ence, but cau&s;es every thing el&s;e which belongs to it to be prodigally conducted.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">
It is impo&s;&s;ible, Sir, for any per&s;on to be an oeconomi&s;t where no order in payments is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed; it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man to be an oeconomi&s;t, who is not able to take a comparative view of his means, and of his expences, for the year which lies before him; it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man to be an oeconomi&s;t, under whom various officers in their &s;everal departments may &s;pend,&mdash;even ju&s;t what they plea&s;e,&mdash;and often with an emulation of expence, as contributing to the importance, if not profit, of their &s;everal departments.&mdash;Thus much is certain; that neither the pre&s;ent, nor any other fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury, has been ever able to take a &s;urvey, or to make even a to|lerable gue&s;s, of the expences of government for any one year; &s;o as to enable him with the lea&s;t degree of certainty, or even probability, to bring his affairs within compa&s;s. Whatever &s;cheme may be formed upon them, mu&s;t be made on a cal|culation of chances. As things are circum|&s;tanced, the fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury cannot make an e&s;timate. I am &s;ure I &s;erve the king, and I am &s;ure I a&s;&s;i&s;t admini&s;tration, by putting oeco|nomy, at lea&s;t in their power. We mu&s;t <HI>cla&s;s &s;er|vices;</HI> we mu&s;t (as far as their nature admits) <HI>ap|propriate</HI> funds; or every thing however reform|ed, will fall again into the old confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Coming upon this ground of the civil li&s;t, the fir&s;t thing in dignity and charge that attracts our notice, is the <HI>royal hou&s;ehold.</HI> This e&s;tabli&s;hment, in my opinion, is exceedingly abu&s;ive in its con|&s;titution. It is formed upon manners and cu&s;|toms, that have long &s;ince expired. In the fir&s;t place, it is formed, in many re&s;pects, upon <HI>feudal principles.</HI> In the feudal times, it was not un|common, even among &s;ubjects, for the lowe&s;t offices to be held by con&s;iderable per&s;ons; per|&s;ons as unfit by their incapacity, as improper
<PB N="37" REF="38">
from their rank, to occupy &s;uch employments. They were held by patent, &s;ometimes for life, and &s;ometimes by inheritance. If my memory does not deceive me, a per&s;on of no &s;light con&s;i|deration, held the office of patent hereditary cook to an earl of Warwick&mdash;The earl of Warwick's &s;oups, I fear, were not the better for the dignity of his kitchen. I think it was an earl of Glou|ce&s;ter, who officiated as &s;teward of the hou&s;ehold to the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury. In&s;tances of the &s;ame kind may in &s;ome degree be found in the Northumberland hou&s;e-book, and other family records. There was &s;ome rea&s;on in ancient ne|ce&s;&s;ities, for the&s;e ancient cu&s;toms. Protection was wanted; and the dome&s;tic tie, though not the highe&s;t, was the clo&s;e&s;t.</P>
<P>The king's hou&s;ehold has not only &s;everal &s;trong traces of this <HI>feudality,</HI> but it is formed al&s;o upon the principles of a <HI>Body-corporate.</HI> It has its own magi&s;trates, courts, and by-laws. This might be nece&s;&s;ary in the antient times, in order to have a government within it&s;elf, capable of regulating the va&s;t and often unruly multitude which compo&s;ed and attended it. This was the origin of the an|tient court called the <HI>Green Cloth&mdash;</HI>compo&s;ed of the mar&s;hal, trea&s;urer, and other great officers of the hou&s;ehold, with certain clerks. The rich &s;ub|jects of the kingdom, who had formerly the &s;ame e&s;tabli&s;hments (only on a reduced &s;cale) have &s;ince altered their oeconomy; and turned the cour&s;e of their expence, from the maintenance of va&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hments within their walls, to the employment of a great variety of independent trades abroad. Their influence is le&s;&s;ened; but a mode of accom|modation and a &s;tyle of &s;plendour, &s;uited to the manners of the times, has been encrea&s;ed. Royalty it&s;elf has in&s;en&s;ibly followed; and the royal hou&s;e|hold has been carried away by the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s tide of manners: but with this very material difference.
<PB N="38" REF="39">
Private men have got rid of the e&s;tabli&s;hments along with the rea&s;ons of them; whereas the royal hou&s;ehold has lo&s;t all that was &s;tately and venerable in the antique manners, without retrenching any thing of the cumbrous charge of a Gothic e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. It is &s;hrunk into the poli&s;hed little|ne&s;s of modern elegance and per&s;onal accommo|dation. It has evaporated from the gro&s;s concrete, into an e&s;&s;ence and rectified &s;pirit of expence, where you have tuns of antient pomp in a vial of modern luxury.</P>
<P>But when the rea&s;on of old e&s;tabli&s;hments is gone, it is ab&s;urd to pre&s;erve nothing but the bur|then of them. This is &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly to embalm a earca&s;s not worth an ounce of the gums that are u&s;ed to pre&s;erve it. It is to burn precious oils in the tomb; it is to offer meat and drink to the dead,&mdash;not &s;o much an honour to the de|cea&s;ed, as a di&s;grace to the &s;urvivors. Our palaces are va&s;t inho&s;pitable halls. There the bleak winds, there, "Boreas, and Eurus, and Caurus, and Arge&s;tes loud," howling through the vacant lob|bies, and clattering the doors of de&s;erted guard|rooms, appal the imagination, and conjure up the grim &s;pectres of departed tyrants&mdash;the Saxon, the Norman, and the Dane; the &s;tern Edwards and fierce Henrys&mdash;who &s;talk from de&s;olation to de|&s;olation, through the dreary vacuity, and melan|choly &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of chill and comfortle&s;s chambers. When this tumult &s;ub&s;ides, a dead, and &s;till more frightful &s;ilence would reign in this de&s;ert, if every now and then the tacking of hammers did not announce, that tho&s;e con&s;tant attendants upon all courts, in all ages, Jobbs, were &s;till alive; for who&s;e &s;ake alone it is, that any trace of ancient grandeur is &s;uffered to remain. The&s;e palaces are a true emblem of &s;ome governments; the inha|bitants are decayed, but the governors and magi|&s;trates &s;till flouri&s;h. They put me in mind of <HI>Old</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="40">
<HI>Sarum,</HI> where the repre&s;entatives, more in number than the con&s;tituents, only &s;erve to inform us, that that this was once a place of trade, and &s;ounding with "the bu&s;y hum of men," though now you can only trace the &s;treets by the colour of the corn; and its &s;ole manufacture is in members of parliament.</P>
<P>The&s;e old e&s;tabli&s;hments were formed al&s;o on a third principle, &s;till more adver&s;e to the living economy of the age. They were formed, Sir, on the principle of <HI>purveyance,</HI> and <HI>receipt in kind.</HI> In former days, when the hou&s;ehold was va&s;t, and the &s;upply &s;canty and precarious, the royal purveyors, &s;allying forth from under the Gothic portcullis, to purcha&s;e provi&s;ion with power and prerogative, in&s;tead of money, brought home the plunder of an hundred markets, and all that could be &s;eized from a flying and hid|ing country, and depo&s;ited their &s;poil in an hun|dred caverns, with each its keeper. There, every commodity, received in its rawe&s;t condition, went through all the proce&s;s which fitted it for u&s;e. This inconvenient receipt produced an oeconomy &s;uited only to it&s;elf. It multiplied offices beyond all mea&s;ure; buttery, pantry, and all that rabble of places, which, though profitable to the holders and expen&s;ive to the &s;tate, are almo&s;t too mean to mention.</P>
<P>All this might be, and I believe was nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t; for it is remarkable, that <HI>purveyance,</HI> after its regulation had been the &s;ubject of a long line of &s;tatutes, (not fewer, I think, than twenty-&s;ix) was wholly taken away by the twelfth of Charles the &s;econd; yet in the next year of the &s;ame reign, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to revive it by a &s;pecial act of parliament, for the &s;ake of the king's jour|nies. This, Sir, is curious; and what would hardly be expected in &s;o reduced a court as that of Charles the &s;econd, and in &s;o improved a
<PB N="40" REF="41">
country as England might then be thought. But &s;o it was. In our time, one well filled and well covered &s;tage-coach, requires more accommoda|tion than a royal progre&s;s; and every di&s;trict at an hour's warning, can &s;upply an army.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay, Sir, that all the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments who&s;e principle is gone, have been &s;y&s;tematically kept up for influence &s;olely: neglect had its &s;hare. But this I am &s;ure of, that a con&s;ideration of in|fluence has hindered any one from attempting to pull them down. For the purpo&s;es of influence, and for tho&s;e purpo&s;es only, are retained half at lea&s;t of the hou&s;ehold e&s;tabli&s;hments. No reve|nue, no not a royal revenue, can exi&s;t under the accumulated charge of antient e&s;tabli&s;hment; mo|dern luxury; and parliamentary political corrup|tion.</P>
<P>If therefore we aim at regulating this hou&s;e|hold, the que&s;tion will be, whether we ought to oeconomize by <HI>detail,</HI> or by <HI>principle?</HI> The example we have had of the &s;ucce&s;s of an attempt to oeco|nomize by detail, and under e&s;tabli&s;hments ad|ver&s;e to the attempt, may tend to decide this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>At the beginning of his maje&s;ty's reign, Lord Talbot came to the admini&s;tration of a great de|partment in the hou&s;ehold. I believe no man ever entered into his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, or into the &s;ervice of any prince, with a more clear integrity, or with more zeal and affection for the intere&s;t of his ma&s;ter; and I mu&s;t add, with abilities for a &s;till higher &s;ervice. Oeconomy was then announced as a maxim of the reign. This noble lord, therefore, made &s;everal attempts towards a reform. In the year 1777, when the king's civil li&s;t debts came la&s;t to be paid, he explained very fully the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his undertaking. He told the hou&s;e of lords, that he had attempted to reduce the charges
<PB N="41" REF="42">
of the king's tables, and his kitchen.&mdash;The thing, Sir, was not below him. He knew, that there is nothing intere&s;ting in the concerns of men, whom we love and honour, that is beneath our atten|tion.&mdash;"Love," &s;ays one of our old poets, <Q>&startq;e&s;|teems no office mean;&endq;</Q> and with &s;till more &s;pirit, "Entire affection &s;corneth nicer hands." Frugality, Sir, is founded on the principle, that all riches have limits. A royal hou&s;ehold, grown enormous, even in the meane&s;t departments, may weaken and perhaps de&s;troy all energy in the high|e&s;t offices of the &s;tate. The gorging a royal kitchen may &s;tint and fami&s;h the negotiations of a king|dom. Therefore, the object was worthy of his, was worthy of any man's attention.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this noble lord's re&s;olution, (as he told the other hou&s;e) he reduced &s;everal tables, and put the per&s;ons entitled to them upon board wages, much to their own &s;atisfaction. But un|luckily, &s;ub&s;equent duties requiring con&s;tant atten|dance, it was not po&s;&s;ible to prevent their being fed where they were employed&mdash;and thus this fir&s;t &s;tep towards oeconomy doubled the expence.</P>
<P>There was another di&s;a&s;ter far more doleful than this. I &s;hall &s;tate it, as the cau&s;e of that misfor|tune lies at the bottom of almo&s;t all our prodiga|lity. Lord Talbot attempted to reform the kitchen; but &s;uch, as he well ob&s;erved, is the con&s;equence of having duty done by one per&s;on, whil&s;t another enjoys the emoluments, that he found him&s;elf fru&s;trated in all his de&s;igns. On that rock his whole adventure &s;plit&mdash;His whole &s;cheme of oeconomy was da&s;hed to pieces; his de|partment became more expen&s;ive than ever;&mdash;the civil li&s;t debt accumulated&mdash;Why? It was truly from a cau&s;e, which, though perfectly adequate to the effect, one would not have in&s;tantly gue&s;&s;ed;&mdash;It was becau&s;e the <HI>turn&s;pit in the king's kitchen</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="43">
<HI>was a member of parliament</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Lord Talbot's &s;peech, in Almon's Parliamentary Regi&s;ter, vol. vii. p. 79 of the Proceedings of the Lords.</NOTE>. The king's dome&s;tic &s;ervants were all undone; his trade&s;men remain|ed unpaid, and became bankrupt<HI>&mdash;becau&s;e the turn|&s;pit of the king's kitchen was a member of parliament.</HI> His maje&s;ty's &s;lumbers were interrupted, his pillow was &s;tuffed with thorns, and his peace of mind entirely broken,<HI>&mdash;becau&s;e the king's turn&s;pit was a member of parliament.</HI> The judges were unpaid; the ju&s;tice of the kingdom bent and gave way; the foreign mini&s;ters remained inactive and unpro|vided; the &s;y&s;tem of Europe was di&s;&s;olved; the chain of our alliances was broken; all the wheels of go|vernment at home and abroad were &s;topped;<HI>&mdash;be|cau&s;e the king's turn&s;pit was a member of parliament.</HI></P>
<P>Such, Sir, was the &s;ituation of affairs, and &s;uch the cau&s;e of that &s;ituation, when his maje&s;ty came a &s;econd time to parliament, to de&s;ire the pay|ment of tho&s;e debts which the employment of its members in various offices, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, had occa&s;ioned. I believe that a like fate will attend every attempt at oeconomy by detail, under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, and in every department. A complex opero&s;e office of account and controul, is in it&s;elf, and even if members of parliament had nothing to do with it, the mo&s;t prodigal of all things. The mo&s;t audacious robberies, or the mo&s;t &s;ubtle frauds, would never venture up|on &s;uch a wa&s;te, as an over careful, detailed guard again&s;t them will infallibly produce. In our e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, we frequently &s;ee an office of account, of an hundred pounds a year expence, and an|other office, of an equal expence, to controul that office, and the whole upon a matter that is not worth twenty &s;hillings.</P>
<P>To avoid, therefore, this minute care which produces the con&s;equences of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive neglect, and to oblige members of parliament to
<PB N="43" REF="44">
attend to public cares, and not to the &s;ervile of|fices of dome&s;tic management, I propo&s;e, Sir, to <HI>oeconomize by principle,</HI> that is, I propo&s;e, to put affairs into that train, which experience points out as the mo&s;t effectual, from the nature of things, and from the con&s;titution of the human mind. In all dealings, where it is po&s;&s;ible, the principles of radical oeconomy pre&s;cribe three things; fir&s;t, undertaking by the great; &s;econdly, engaging with per&s;ons of &s;kill in the &s;ubject matter; thirdly, engaging with tho&s;e who &s;hall have an immediate and direct intere&s;t in the proper execution of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>To avoid frittering and crumbling down the attention, by a blind un&s;y&s;tematic ob&s;ervance of every trifle, it has ever been found the be&s;t way, to do all things, which are great in the total amount, and minute in the component parts, by a <HI>general contract.</HI> The principles of trade have &s;o pervaded every &s;pecies of dealing, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t objects; all tran&s;actions are got &s;o much into &s;y&s;tem; that we may, at a moment's warning, and to a farthing value, be informed at what rate any &s;ervice may be &s;upplied. No dealing is exempt from the po&s;&s;ibility of fraud. But by a contract on a matter certain, you have this advantage&mdash;you are &s;ure to know the utmo&s;t <HI>extent</HI> of the fraud to which you are &s;ubject. By a contract with a per&s;on in <HI>his own trade,</HI> you are &s;ure you &s;hall not &s;uffer by <HI>want of &s;kill.</HI> By a <HI>&s;hort</HI> contract you are &s;ure of making it the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> of the con|tractor to exert that &s;kill for the &s;atisfaction of his employers.</P>
<P>I mean to derogate nothing from the diligence or integrity of the pre&s;ent, or of any former board of green-cloth. But what &s;kill can members of parliament obtain in that low kind of province? What plea&s;ure can they have in the execution of
<PB N="44" REF="45">
that kind of duty? And if they &s;hould neglect it, how does it affect their intere&s;t, when we know, that it is their vote in parliament, and not their diligence in cookery or catering, that recommends them to their office, or keeps them in it?</P>
<P>I therefore propo&s;e, that the king's tables (to whatever number of tables, or covers to each, he &s;hall think proper to command) &s;hould be cla&s;&s;ed by the &s;teward of the hou&s;ehold, and &s;hould be contracted for, according to their rank, by the head or cover;&mdash;that the e&s;timate and circum|&s;tance of the contract &s;hould be carried to the trea&s;ury to be approved; and that its faithful and &s;atisfactory performance &s;hould be reported there, previous to any payment; that there, and there only, &s;hould the payment be made. I pro|po&s;e, that men &s;hould be contracted with only in their proper trade; and that no member of parliament &s;hould be capable of &s;uch contract. By this plan, almo&s;t all the infinite offices un|der the lord &s;teward may be &s;pared; to the ex|treme &s;implification, and to the far better exe|cution, of every one of his functions. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia is &s;o &s;erved. He is a great and emi|nent (though indeed a very rare) in&s;tance of the po&s;&s;ibility of uniting in a mind of vigour and compa&s;s, an attention to minute objects, with the large&s;t views, and the mo&s;t complicated plans. His tables are &s;erved by contract, and by the head. Let me &s;ay, that no prince can be a&s;hamed to imitate the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; <Q>and particularly to learn in his &s;chool, when the problem is&mdash;&startq;The be&s;t manner of reconciling the &s;tate of a court with the &s;upport of war? Other courts,&endq; I under&s;tand, have followed him with effect, and to their &s;atisfaction.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame clue of principle leads us through the labyrinth of the other departments. What, Sir, is there in the office of <HI>the great wardrobe</HI> (which
<PB N="45" REF="46">
has the care of the king's furniture) that may not be executed by the <HI>lord chamberlain</HI> him&s;elf. He has an honourable appointment; he has time &s;ufficient to attend to the duty; and he has the vice chamberlain to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Why &s;hould not he deal al&s;o by contract, for all things be|longing to this office, and carry his e&s;timates fir&s;t, and his report of the execution in its proper time, for payment, directly to the board of trea|&s;ury it&s;elf? By a &s;imple operation (containing in it a treble control) the expences of a department, which for naked walls, or walls hung with cob|webs, has in a few years co&s;t the crown &pound;. 150,000, may at length hope for regulation. But, Sir, the office and its bu&s;ine&s;s are at variance. As it &s;tands, it &s;erves, not to furni&s;h the palace with its hangings, but the parliament with its dependent members.</P>
<P>To what end, Sir, does the office of <HI>removing wardrobe</HI> &s;erve at all? Why &s;hould a <HI>jewel office</HI> exi&s;t for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of taxing the king's gifts of plate? Its object falls naturally within the <HI>chamberlain</HI>'s province; and ought to be under his care and in&s;pection, without any fee. Why &s;hould an office of the <HI>robes</HI> exi&s;t, when that of <HI>groom of the &s;tole</HI> is a &s;inecure, and that this is a proper object of his department?</P>
<P>All the&s;e incumbrances, which are them&s;elves nu&s;ances, produce other incumbrances, and other nu&s;ances. For the payment of the&s;e u&s;ele&s;s e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, there are no le&s;s than <HI>three u&s;ele&s;s trea&s;urers;</HI> two to hold a pur&s;e, and one to play with a &s;tick. The trea&s;urer of the hou&s;ehold is a mere name. The cofferer, and the trea&s;urer of the chamber, receive and pay great &s;ums, which it is not at all nece&s;&s;ary <HI>they</HI> &s;hould either receive or pay. All the proper officers, &s;ervants, and trade&s;men, may be inrolled in their &s;everal departments, and paid in proper cla&s;&s;es and times
<PB N="46" REF="47">
with great &s;implicity and order, at the exchequer, and by direction from the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>The <HI>board of works,</HI> which in the &s;even years preceding 1777, has co&s;t towards &pound;. 400, 000 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">More exactly &pound;. 378,616. 10s. 1d. &frac14;.</NOTE>; and (if I recollect rightly) has not co&s;t le&s;s in propor|tion from the beginning of the reign, is under the very &s;ame de&s;cription of all the other ill-con|trived e&s;tabli&s;hments, and calls for the very &s;ame reform. We are to &s;eek for the vi&s;ible &s;igns of all this expence.&mdash;For all this expence, we do not &s;ee a building of the &s;ize and importance of a pigeon-hou&s;e. Buckingham-hou&s;e was repri&s;ed by a bargain with the public, for one hundred thou&s;and pounds;&mdash;and the &s;mall hou&s;e at Wind|&s;or has been, if I mi&s;take not, undertaken &s;ince that account was brought before us. The good works of that board of works, are as carefully concealed, as other good works ought to be. They are per|fectly invi&s;ible. But though it is the perfection of charity to be concealed, it is, Sir, the pro|perty and glory of magnificence, to appear, and &s;tand forward to the eye.</P>
<P>That board, which ought to be a concern of builders, and &s;uch like, and of none el&s;e, is turn|ed into a junto of members of parliament. That office too has a <HI>trea&s;ury,</HI> and a payma&s;ter of its own; and le&s;t the arduous affairs of that impor|tant exchequer &s;hould be too fatiguing, that payma&s;ter has a deputy to partake his profits, and relieve his cares. I do not believe, that ei|ther now or in former times, the chief managers of that board have made any profit of its abu&s;e. It is, however, no good rea&s;on that an abu&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t, becau&s;e it is of as little private as of public advantage. But this e&s;tabli&s;hment has the grand radical fault, the original &s;in, that pervades and perverts all our
<PB N="47" REF="48">
e&s;tabli&s;hments;&mdash;The apparatus is not fitted to the object, nor the workmen to the work. Expences are incurred on the private opinion of an inferior e&s;tabli&s;hment, without con&s;ulting the principal; who can alone determine the proportion which it ought to bear to the other e&s;tabli&s;hments of the &s;tate, in the order of their relative importance.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e, therefore, along with the re&s;t, to pull down this whole ill-contrived &s;caffolding, which ob&s;tructs, rather than forwards our public works; to take away its trea&s;ury; to put the whole into the hands of a real builder, who &s;hall not be a member of parliament; and to oblige him by a previous e&s;timate and final payment, to appear twice at the trea&s;ury, before the public can be loaded. The king's gardens are to come under a &s;imilar regulation.</P>
<P>The <HI>mint,</HI> though not a department of the hou&s;ehold, has the &s;ame vices. It is a great expence to the nation, chiefly for the &s;ake of members of parliament. It has its officers of pa|rade and dignity. It has its trea&s;ury too. It is a &s;ort of corporate body; and formerly was a body of great importance; as much &s;o, on the then &s;cale of things, and the then order of bu&s;ine&s;s, as the bank is at this day. It was the great center of money tran&s;actions and remittances for our own, and for other nations; until king Charles the fir&s;t, among other arbitrary projects, dictated by de&s;potic nece&s;&s;ity, made him withhold the money that lay there for remittance. That blow, (and happily too) the mint never recover'd. Now it is no bank; no remittance-&s;hop. The mint, Sir, is a <HI>manufacture,</HI> and it is nothing el&s;e; and it ought to be undertaken upon the principles of a manufacture; that is, for the be&s;t and cheape&s;t execution, by a contract, upon proper &s;ecurities, and under proper regulations.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49">
The <HI>artillery</HI> is a far greater object; it is a military concern; but having an affinity and kindred in its defects with the e&s;tabli&s;hments I am now &s;peaking of, I think it be&s;t to &s;peak of it along with them. It is, I conceive, an e&s;tabli&s;hment not well &s;uited to its martial, though exceedingly well calculated for its par|liamentary purpo&s;es.&mdash;Here there is a <HI>trea|&s;ury,</HI> as in all the other inferior departments of government. Here the military is &s;ubordinate to the civil, and the naval confounded with the land &s;ervice. The object indeed is much the &s;ame in both. But when the detail is examined, it will be found that they had better be &s;eparated. For a reform of this office, I propo&s;e to re&s;tore things, to what (all con&s;iderations taken together) is their natural order; to re&s;tore them to their ju&s;t propor|tion, and to their ju&s;t di&s;tribution. I propo&s;e, in this military concern, to render the civil &s;ubordinate to the military; and this will annihilate the greate&s;t part of the expence, and all the influence belonging to the office. I propo&s;e to &s;end the military branch to the army, and the naval to the Admiralty: and I intend to perfect and accompli&s;h the whole detail (where it becomes too minute and complicated for legi&s;lature, and requires exact, official, military, and mechanical knowledge) by a commi&s;&s;ion of competent officers in both departments. I pro|po&s;e to execute by contract, what by contract can be executed, and to bring, as much as po&s;|&s;ible, all e&s;timates to be previou&s;ly approved, and finally to be paid by the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Thus, by following the cour&s;e of nature, and not the purpo&s;es of politics, or the accumulated patchwork of occa&s;ional accommodation, this va&s;t expen&s;ive department may be methodized; its &s;er|vice proportioned to its nece&s;&s;ities; and its pay|ments &s;ubjected to the in&s;pection of the &s;uperior mini&s;ter of finance; who is to judge of it on the
<PB N="49" REF="50">
re&s;ult of the total collective exigencies of the &s;tate. This la&s;t is a reigning principle through my whole plan; and it is a principle which I hope may hereafter be applied to other plans.</P>
<P>By the&s;e regulations taken together&mdash;be&s;ides the three &s;ubordinate trea&s;uries in the le&s;&s;er prin|cipalities, five other &s;ubordinate trea&s;uries are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. There is taken away the whole <HI>e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of detail</HI> in the hou&s;ehold; the <HI>trea&s;u|rer;&mdash;</HI>the <HI>comptroller</HI> (for a comptroller is hardly nece&s;&s;ary where there is no trea&s;urer) the <HI>cofferer of the hou&s;ehold;&mdash;</HI>the <HI>trea&s;urer of the chamber;&mdash;</HI>the <HI>ma&s;ter of the hou&s;ehold;&mdash;</HI>the whole <HI>board of green cloth;&mdash;</HI>and a va&s;t number of &s;ubordinate offices in the department of the <HI>&s;teward of the hou&s;ehold;&mdash;</HI>the whole e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>great wardrobe;&mdash;</HI>the <HI>removing wardrobe;&mdash;</HI>the <HI>jewel office;&mdash;</HI>the <HI>robes;&mdash;</HI>the <HI>board of works;</HI> almo&s;t the whole charge of the <HI>civil branch</HI> of the <HI>board of ordnance,</HI> are taken away. All the&s;e arrange|ments together will be found to relieve the nation from a va&s;t weight of influence, without di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing, but rather by forwarding every public &s;ervice. When &s;omething of this kind is done, then the public may begin to breathe. Under other governments, a que&s;tion of expence is only a que&s;tion of oeconomy, and it is nothing more; with us in every que&s;tion of expence, there is always a mixture of con&s;titutional con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>It is, Sir, becau&s;e I wi&s;h to keep this bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ubordinate trea&s;uries&punc; as much as I can to|gether, that I brought the <HI>ordnance - office</HI> before you, though it is properly a military department. For the &s;ame rea&s;on I will now trouble you with my thoughts and propo&s;iti|ons upon two of the greate&s;t <HI>under trea&s;uries,</HI> I mean the office of <HI>payma&s;ter of the land forces</HI> or <HI>trea&s;urer of the army;</HI> and that of the <HI>trea&s;urer</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="51">
<HI>of the navy.</HI> The former of the&s;e has long been a great object of public &s;u&s;picion and unea&s;ine&s;s. Envy too has had its &s;hare in the oblequy which is ca&s;t upon this office. But I am &s;ure that it has no &s;hare at all in the reflections I &s;hall make upon it, or in the reformations that I &s;hall propo&s;e. I do not grudge to the honourable gentleman who at pre|&s;ent holds the office, any of the effects of his talents, his merit, or his fortune. He is re&s;pectable in all the&s;e particulars. I follow the con&s;titution of the office, without per&s;ecuting its holder. It is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in all matters of public complaint, where men frequently feel right and argue wrong, to &s;e|perate prejudice from rea&s;on; and to be very &s;ure, in attempting the redre&s;s of a grievance, that we hit upon its real &s;eat, and its true nature. Where there is an abu&s;e in office, the fir&s;t thing that oc|curs in heat is to cen&s;ure the officer. Our natu|ral di&s;po&s;ition leads all our enquiries rather to per&s;ons than to things. But this prejudice is to be corrected by maturer thinking.</P>
<P>Sir, the profits of the <HI>pay-office</HI> (as an office) are not too great, in my opinion, for its duties, and for the rank of the per&s;on who has generally held it. He has been generally a per&s;on of the highe&s;t rank; that is to &s;ay, a per&s;on of eminence and con&s;ideration in this hou&s;e. The great and the invidious profits of the pay-office, are from the <HI>Bank</HI> that is held in it. According to the pre&s;ent cour&s;e of the office, and according to the pre&s;ent mode of accounting there, this bank mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily exi&s;t &s;omewhere. Money is a productive thing; and when the u&s;ual time of its demand can be tolerably calculated, it may, with prudence, be &s;afely laid out to the profit of the holder. It is on this calculation, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of banking proceeds. But no profit can be derived from the u&s;e of money, which does not make it the intere&s;t
<PB N="51" REF="52">
of the holder to delay his account. The proce&s;s of the exchequer colludes with this intere&s;t. Is this collu&s;ion from its want of rigour, and &s;trict|ne&s;s, and great regularity of form? The rever&s;e is true. They have in the exchequer brought ri|gour and formali&s;m to their ultimate perfection. The proce&s;s again&s;t accountants is &s;o rigorous, and in a manner &s;o unju&s;t, that correctives mu&s;t, from time to time, be applied to it. The&s;e cor|rectives being di&s;cretionary, upon the ca&s;e, and generally remitted by the barons to the lords of the trea&s;ury, as the be&s;t judges of the rea&s;ons for re&s;pite, hearings are had; delays are produced; and thus the extreme of rigour in office (as u&s;ual in all human affairs) leads to the extreme of lax|ity. What with the intere&s;ted delay of the offi|cer; the ill-conceived exactne&s;s of the court; the applications for di&s;pen&s;ations from that exactne&s;s, the revival of rigorous proce&s;s, after the expira|tion of the time; and the new rigours producing new applications, and new enlargements of time, &s;uch delays happen in the public accounts, that they can &s;carcely ever be clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Sir, they have a rule in the exchequer, which, I believe, they have founded upon a very ancient &s;tatute, that of the 51&s;t of Henry III. by which it is provided, <Q>&startq;That when a &s;heriff or bailiff hath began his account, none other &s;hall be received to account, until he that was fir&s;t appointed hath clearly accounted, and that the &s;um has been received <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Et quant vi&s;count ou bailliff ait commence de accompter|nul autre ne &s;eit re&s;ceu de acconter tanque le primer qe &s;oit a&s;&s;is, eit peraccompte, et qe la &s;omme &s;oit re&s;ceu. Stat. 5. ann. dom. 1266.</NOTE>.&endq;</Q> Whether this clau&s;e of that &s;tatute be the ground of that ab&s;urd practice, I am not quite able to a&s;certain. But it has very generally prevailed, though I am told
<PB N="52" REF="53">
that of late they have began to relax from it. In con&s;equence of forms adver&s;e to &s;ub&s;tantial account, we have a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pay-ma&s;ters and their repre&s;entatives, who have never been admitted to account, although perfectly ready to do &s;o.</P>
<P>As the extent of our wars has &s;cattered the accountants under the pay-ma&s;ter into every part of the globe, the grand and &s;ure pay-ma&s;ter, Death, in all his &s;hapes, calls the&s;e accountants to another reckoning. Death, indeed, domineers over every thing, but the forms of the exchequer. Over the&s;e he has no power. They are impa&s;|&s;ive and immortal. The audit of the exchequer, more &s;evere than the audit to which the ac|countants are gone, demands proofs which in the nature of things are difficult, &s;ometimes impo&s;&s;ible to be had. In this re&s;pect, too, rigour, as u&s;ual, defeats it&s;elf. Then, the exchequer never gives a particular receipt, or clears a man of his account, as far as it goes. A final acquittance (or a <HI>quie|tus,</HI> as they term it) is &s;carcely ever to be obtained. Terrors and gho&s;ts of unlaid accountants, haunt the hou&s;es of their children from generation to ge|neration. Families, in the cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, fall into minorities; the inheritance comes into the hands of females; and very perplexed affairs are often delivered over into the hands of negli|gent guardians, and faithle&s;s &s;tewards. So that the demand remains, when the advantage of the money is gone, if ever any advantage at all has been made of it. This is a cau&s;e of infinite di&s;tre&s;s to fa|milies; and becomes a &s;ource of influence to an extent, that can &s;carcely be imagined, but by tho&s;e who have taken &s;ome pains to trace it. The mildne&s;s of government in the employment of u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous powers, furni&s;hes no rea|&s;on for their continuance.</P>

As things &s;tand, can you in ju&s;tice (except perhaps in that over-perfect kind of ju&s;tice which has obtained, by its merits, the title of the oppo|po&s;ite vice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Summum jus &s;umma injuria.</NOTE>) in&s;i&s;t that any man &s;hould, by the cour&s;e of his office, keep a <HI>bank</HI> from whence he is to derive no advantage? That a man &s;hould be &s;ubject to demands below, and be in a manner refu&s;ed an acquittance above; that he &s;hould tran&s;mit an original &s;in, and inheritance of vexation to his po&s;terity, without a power of compen&s;ating him&s;elf in &s;ome way or other, for &s;o perilous a &s;ituation? We know, that if the pay-ma&s;ter &s;hould deny him&s;elf the advantages of his bank, the public, as things &s;tand, is not the richer for it by a &s;ingle &s;hilling.

<P>The trea&s;urer of the navy is, <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. Indeed all account|ants are. In&s;tead of the pre&s;ent mode, which is trouble&s;ome to the officer, and unprofitable to the public, I propo&s;e to &s;ub&s;titute &s;omething more effectual than rigour, which is the wor&s;t ex|actor in the world. I mean to remove&punc; the very temptations to delay; to facilitate the account; and to transfer this bank, now of private emolu|ment, to the public. The crown will &s;uffer no wrong at lea&s;t from the pay offices; and its terrors will no longer reign over the families of tho&s;e who hold or have held them. I propo&s;e, that the&s;e offices &s;hould be no longer <HI>banks</HI> or <HI>trea&s;uries,</HI> but mere <HI>offices of admini&s;tration.&mdash;</HI>I propo&s;e, fir&s;t, that the pre&s;ent payma&s;ter and the trea&s;urer of the navy, &s;hould carry into the exchequer the whole
<PB N="54" REF="55">
body of the vouchers for what they have paid over to deputy payma&s;ters, to regimental agents, or to any of tho&s;e to whom they have and ought to have paid money. I propo&s;e that tho&s;e vouch|ers &s;hall be admitted as actual payments in their accounts; and that the per&s;ons to whom the mo|ney has been paid, &s;hall then &s;tand charged in the exchequer in their place. After this pro|ce&s;s, they &s;hall be debited or charged for no|thing but the money-balance that remains in their hands.</P>
<P>I am con&s;cious, Sir, that if this balance (which they could not expect to be &s;o &s;uddenly de|manded by any u&s;ual proce&s;s of the exchequer) &s;hould now be exacted all at once, not only their ruin, but a ruin of others to an extent which I do not like to think of, but which I can well conceive, and which you may well conceive, might be the con&s;equence. I told you, Sir, when I promi&s;ed before the holydays to bring in this plan, that I never would &s;uffer any man, or de&s;cription of men, to &s;uffer from errors that naturally have grown out of the abu&s;ive con&s;titution of tho&s;e offices which I propo&s;e to regulate. If I cannot reform with equity, I will not reform at all.</P>
<P>For the regulation of pa&s;t accounts, I &s;hall therefore propo&s;e &s;uch a mode, as men, temperate and prudent, make u&s;e of in the management of their private affairs, when their accounts are vari|ous, perplexed, and of long &s;tanding. I would therefore, after their example, divide the public debts into three &s;orts; good; bad; and doubt|ful. In looking over the public accounts, I &s;hould never dream of the blind mode of the ex|chequer, which regards things in the ab&s;tract, and knows no difference in the quality of its debts, or the circum&s;tances of its debtors. By this means, it fatigues it&s;elf; it vexes others; it often cru&s;hes
<PB N="55" REF="56">
the poor; it lets e&s;cape the rich; or in a fit of mercy or carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, declines all means of re|covering its ju&s;t demands. Content with the eternity of its claims, it enjoys its Epicurean divinity with Epicurean languor. But it is proper that all &s;orts of accounts &s;hould be clo&s;ed &s;ome time or other&mdash;by payment; by compo|&s;ition; or by oblivion. <HI>Expedit reipublicae ut &s;it finis litium.</HI> Con&s;tantly taking along with me, that an extreme rigour is &s;ure to arm every thing again&s;t it, and at length to relax into a &s;upine neglect, I propo&s;e, Sir, that even the be&s;t, &s;ounde&s;t, and the mo&s;t recent debts, &s;hould be put into in&s;talments, for the mutual benefit of the accountant and the public.</P>
<P>In proportion, however, as I am tender of the pa&s;t, I would be provident of the future. All mo|ney that was formerly impre&s;ted to the two great <HI>pay-offices,</HI> I would have impre&s;ted in future to the <HI>bank of England.</HI> The&s;e offices &s;hould, in future, receive no more than ca&s;h &s;ufficient for &s;mall pay|ments. Their other payments ought to be made by drafts on the Bank, expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ervice. A cheque account from both offices, of drafts and receipts, &s;hould be annually made up in the ex|chequer, charging the bank, in account, with the ca&s;h-balance, but not demanding the payment un|til there is an order from the trea&s;ury, in con&s;e|quence of a vote of parliament.</P>
<P>As I did not, Sir, deny to the payma&s;ter the na|tural profits of the bank that was in his hands, &s;o neither would I to the bank of England. A &s;hare of that profit might be derived to the public in various ways. My favourite mode is this; that, in compen&s;ation for the u&s;e of this money, the bank may take upon them&s;elves, fir&s;t, <HI>the charge of the mint;</HI> to which they are already, by their charter,
<PB N="56" REF="57">
obliged to bring in a great deal of bullion annually to be coined.</P>
<P>In the next place, I mean that they &s;hould take upon them&s;elves the charge of <HI>remittances to our troops abroad.</HI> This is a &s;pecies of dealing from which, by the &s;ame charter, they are not debarred. One and a quarter <HI>per cent.</HI> will be &s;aved in&s;tantly thereby to the public, on very large &s;ums of money. This will be at once a matter of oeconomy, and a con&s;iderable reduction of influence, by taking away a private contract of an expen&s;ive nature. If the bank, which is a great corporation, and of cour&s;e receives the lea&s;t profits from the money in their cu&s;tody, &s;hould of it&s;elf refu&s;e, or be per&s;uaded to refu&s;e, this offer upon tho&s;e terms, I can &s;peak with &s;ome confidence, that one at lea&s;t, if not both parts of the condi|tion would be received, and gratefully received, by &s;everal bankers of eminence. There is no banker who will not be at lea&s;t as good &s;ecurity as any payma&s;ter of the forces, or any trea&s;urer of the navy, that have ever been bankers to the public: as rich at lea&s;t as my lord Chatham, or my lord Holland, or either of the honourable gentlemen, who now hold the offices, were, at the time that they entered into them; or as ever the whole e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>mint</HI> has been at any period.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are the outlines of the plan I mean to follow, in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e two large &s;ubor|dinate trea&s;uries. I now come to another &s;ubor|dinate trea&s;ury; I mean, that of the <HI>payma&s;ter of the pen&s;ions;</HI> for which purpo&s;e I re-enter the li|mits of the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment&mdash;I departed from tho&s;e limits in pur&s;uit of a principle; and follow|ing the &s;ame game in its doubles, I am brought into tho&s;e limits again. That trea&s;ury, and that office, I mean to take away; and to transfer the
<PB N="57" REF="58">
payment of every name, mode, and denomina|tion of pen&s;ions, to the <HI>exchequer.</HI> The pre&s;ent cour&s;e of diver&s;ifying the &s;ame object, can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e; whatever its u&s;e may be to purpo&s;es of another kind. There are al&s;o other li&s;ts of pen&s;ions; and I mean that they &s;hould all be here|after paid at one and the &s;ame place. The whole of that new con&s;olidated li&s;t, I mean to reduce to &pound;. 60, 000 a year, which &s;um I intend it &s;hall ne|ver exceed. I think that &s;um will fully an&s;wer as a reward to all real merit, and a provi&s;ion for all real public charity that is ever like to be placed upon the li&s;t. If any merit of an extraordinary nature &s;hould emerge, before that reduction is completed, I have left it open for an ad|dre&s;s of either hou&s;e of parliament to provide for the ca&s;e. <Q>To all other demands, it mu&s;t be an&s;wered, with regret, but with firmne&s;s, &startq;the public is poor.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I do not propo&s;e, as I told you before Chri&s;t|mas, to take away any pen&s;ion. I know that the public &s;eem to call for a reduction of &s;uch of them as &s;hall appear unmerited. As a cen&s;orial act, and puni&s;hment of an abu&s;e, might an|&s;wer &s;ome purpo&s;e. But this can make no part of <HI>my</HI> plan. I mean to proceed by bill; and I cannot &s;top for &s;uch an enquiry. I know &s;ome gentlemen may blame me. It is with great &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to better judgments, that I recommend it to con&s;ideration; that a critical retro&s;pective exa|mination of the pen&s;ion li&s;t, upon the principle of merit, can never &s;erve for my ba&s;is.&mdash;It can|not an&s;wer, according to my plan, any effectual purpo&s;e of oeconomy, or of future permanent re|formation. The proce&s;s, in any way, will be en|tangled and difficult; and it will be infinitely &s;low: There is a danger that if we turn our line of march, now directed towards the grand
<PB N="58" REF="59">
object, into this more laborious than u&s;eful de|tail of operations, we &s;hall never arrive at our end.</P>
<P>The king, Sir, has been, by the con&s;titution, appointed &s;ole judge of the merit for which a pen&s;ion is to be given. We have a right, un|doubtedly, to canva&s;s this, as we have to can|va&s;s every act of government. But there is a ma|terial difference between an office to be reformed, and a pen&s;ion taken away for demerit. In the for|mer ca&s;e, no charge is implied again&s;t the holder; in the latter, his character is &s;lurred, as well as his lawful emolument affected. The former proce&s;s is again&s;t the thing; the &s;econd again&s;t the per&s;on. The pen&s;ioner certainly, if he plea&s;es, has a right to &s;tand on his own defence; to plead his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and to bottom his title in the competency of the crown to give him what he holds. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and on the defen&s;ive as he is, he will not be obliged to prove his &s;pecial merit, in order to ju&s;tify the act of legal di&s;cretion, now turned into his property, according to his tenure. The very act, he will contend, is a legal pre&s;umption, and an im|plication of his merit. If this be &s;o (from the natural force of all legal pre&s;umption) he would put us to the difficult proof, that he has no merit at all. But other que&s;tions would ari&s;e in the cour&s;e of &s;uch an enquiry; that is, que&s;tions of the merit when weighed again&s;t the proportion of the re|ward; then the difficulty will be much greater.</P>
<P>The difficulty will not, Sir, I am afraid, be much le&s;s, if we pa&s;s to the per&s;on really guilty, in the que&s;tion of an unmerited pen&s;ion; the mi|ni&s;ter him&s;elf. I admit, that when called to ac|count for the execution of a tru&s;t, he might fairly be obliged to prove the affirmative; and to &s;tate the merit for which the pen&s;ion is given; though on the pen&s;ioner him&s;elf, &s;uch a proce&s;s would be hard. If in this examination we proceed methodically, and
<PB N="59" REF="60">
&s;o as to avoid all &s;u&s;picion of partiality and pre|judice, we mu&s;t take the pen&s;ions in order of time, or merely alphabetically. The very fir&s;t pen&s;ion to which we come, in either of the&s;e ways, may ap|pear the mo&s;t gro&s;sly unmerited of any. But the mini&s;ter may very po&s;&s;ibly &s;hew, that he knows no|thing of the putting on this pen&s;ion&mdash;that it was prior in time to his admini&s;tration&mdash;that the mini|&s;ter, who laid it on, is dead; and then we are thrown back upon the pen&s;ioner him&s;elf, and plunged into all our former difficulties. Abu&s;es, and gro&s;s ones, I doubt not, would appear; and to the correction of which I would readily give my hand; but, when I con&s;ider that pen&s;ions have not generally been affected by the revolutions of mini&s;try; as I know not where &s;uch enquiries would &s;top; and as an ab&s;ence of merit is a nega|tive and loo&s;e thing, one might be led to derange the order of families, founded on the probable continuance of their kind of income. I might hurt children; I might injure creditors. I really think it the more prudent cour&s;e, not to follow the letter of the petitions. If we fix this mode of enquiry as a ba&s;is, we &s;hall, I fear, end, as par|liament has often ended under &s;imilar circum|&s;tances. There will be great delay; much con|fu&s;ion; much inequality in our proceedings. But what pre&s;&s;es me mo&s;t of all is this; that though we &s;hould &s;trike off all the unmerited pen&s;ions, while the power of the crown remains unlimited, the very &s;ame unde&s;erving per&s;ons might afterwards return to the very &s;ame li&s;t: or if they did not, other per&s;ons, meriting as little as they do, might be put upon it to an undefinable amount. This I think is the pinch of the grievance.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, Sir, I am obliged to wave this mode of proceeding as any part of my plan. In a plan of reformation, it would be one of my
<PB N="60" REF="61">
maxims, that when I know of an e&s;tabli&s;hment which may be &s;ub&s;ervient to u&s;eful purpo&s;es, and which at the &s;ame time, from its di&s;cretionary na|ture, is liable to a very great perver&s;ion from tho&s;e purpo&s;es, <HI>I would limit the quantity of the power that might be &s;o abu&s;ed.</HI> For I am &s;ure, that in all &s;uch ca&s;es, the rewards of merit will have very narrow bounds; and that partial or corrupt favour will be infinite. This principle is not arbitrary; but the limitation of the &s;pecific quan|tity mu&s;t be &s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure. I therefore &s;tate &pound;. 60, 000; leaving it open to the hou&s;e to enlarge or contract the &s;um as they &s;hall &s;ee, on examination, that the di&s;cretion I u&s;e is &s;canty or liberal. The whole amount of the pen&s;ions of all denominations, which have been laid before us, amount, for a period of &s;even years, to con|&s;iderably more than &pound;. 100, 000 a year. To what the other li&s;ts amount, I know not. That will be &s;een hereafter. But from tho&s;e that do appear, a &s;aving will accrue to the public, at one time or other, of &pound;. 40, 000 a year, and we had better in my opinion to let it fall in naturally, than to tear it crude and unripe from the &s;talk. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was &s;uppo&s;ed by the Lord Advocate, in a &s;ub&s;equent debate, that Mr. Burke, becau&s;e he objected to an enquiry into the pen&s;ion li&s;t for the purpo&s;e of oeconomy and relief of the public, would have it withheld from the judgment of parliament for all purpo&s;es what&s;oever. This learned gen|tleman certainly mi&s;under&s;tood him. His plan &s;hews, that he wi&s;hed the whole li&s;t to be ea&s;ily acce&s;&s;ible; and he knows that the public eye is of it&s;elf a great guard again&s;t abu&s;e.</NOTE></P>
<P>There is a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s among the people, upon an article which I mu&s;t cla&s;s under the head of pen&s;ions. I mean the <HI>great patent of|fices in the exchequer.</HI> They are in reality and &s;ub&s;tance no other than pen&s;ions, and in no other light &s;hall I con&s;ider them. They are &s;inecures.
<PB N="61" REF="62">
They are always executed by deputy. The duty of the principal is as nothing. They differ how|ever from the pen&s;ions on the li&s;t, in &s;ome parti|culars. They are held for life. I think with the public, that the profits of tho&s;e places are grown enormous; the magnitude of tho&s;e profits, and the nature of them, both call for reformation. The nature of their profits which grow out of the pu|blic di&s;tre&s;s, is it&s;elf invidious and grievous. But I fear that reform cannot be immediate. I find my&s;elf under a re&s;triction. The&s;e places, and others of the &s;ame kind, which are held for life, have been con&s;idered as property. They have been given as a provi&s;ion for children; they have been the &s;ubject of family &s;ettlements; they have been the &s;ecurity of creditors. What the law re&s;pects &s;hall be &s;acred to me. If the barriers of law &s;hould be broken down, upon ideas of convenience, even of public convenience, we &s;hall have no longer any thing certain among us. If the di&s;cretion of power is once let loo&s;e upon property, we can be at no lo&s;s to deter|mine who&s;e power, and what di&s;cretion it is that will prevail at la&s;t. It would be wi&s;e to attend upon the order of things; and not to attempt to outrun the &s;low, but &s;mooth and even cour&s;e of nature. There are oc|ca&s;ions, I admit, of public nece&s;&s;ity, &s;o va&s;t, &s;o clear, &s;o evident, that they &s;uper&s;ede all laws. Law being only made for the benefit of the communi|ty cannot in any one of its parts, re&s;i&s;t a demand which may comprehend the total of the public intere&s;t. To be &s;ure, no law can &s;et it&s;elf up again&s;t the cau&s;e and rea&s;on of all law. But &s;uch a ca&s;e very rarely happens; and this mo&s;t certainly is not &s;uch a ca&s;e. The mere time of the reform is by no means worth the &s;acrifice of a principle of law. Individuals pa&s;s like &s;hadows; but the com|monwealth is fixed and &s;table. The difference there|fore of to-day and to-morrow, which to private
<PB N="62" REF="63">
people is immen&s;e, to the &s;tate is nothing. At any rate it is better, if po&s;&s;ible, to reconcile our oeconomy with our laws, than to &s;et them at variance; a quarrel which in the end mu&s;t be de|&s;tructive to both.</P>
<P>My idea, therefore, is to reduce tho&s;e offices to fixed &s;alaries, as the pre&s;ent lives and rever&s;ions &s;hall &s;ucce&s;&s;ively fall. I mean, that the office of the great auditor (the auditor of the receipt) &s;hall be reduced to &pound;. 3, 000 a year; and the auditors of the impre&s;t and the re&s;t of the principal officers, to fixed ap|pointments of &pound;. 1&punc;500 a year each. It will not be difficult to calculate the value of this fall of lives to the public, when we &s;hall have obtained a ju&s;t account of the pre&s;ent income of tho&s;e places; and we &s;hall obtain that account with great facility, if the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors are not alarmed with any apprehen&s;ion of danger to their freehold office.</P>
<P>I know too, that it will be demanded of me, how it comes, that &s;ince I admit the&s;e offices to be no better than pen&s;ions, I cho&s;e, after the princi|ple of law had been &s;atisfied, to retain them at all? To this, Sir, I an&s;wer, that conceiving it to be a fundamental part of the con&s;titution of this country, and of the rea&s;on of &s;tate in every coun|try, that there mu&s;t be means of rewarding public &s;ervice, tho&s;e means will be incomplete, and indeed wholly in&s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, if there &s;hould be no fur-her reward for that &s;ervice, than the daily wages it receives during the plea&s;ure of the crown.</P>
<P>Whoever &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;iders the excellent argu|ment of Lord Somers, in the banker's ca&s;e, will &s;ee he bottoms him&s;elf upon the very &s;ame maxim which I do; and one of his principal grounds of doc|trine for the alienability of the domain in England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before the &s;tatute of Queen Anne, which limited the alienation of land.</NOTE>
<PB N="63" REF="64">
contrary to the maxim of the law in France, he lays in the con&s;titutional policy, of furni&s;hing a permanent reward to public &s;ervice; of making that reward the origin of families; and the foun|dation of wealth as well as of honours. It is indeed the only genuine unadulterated origin of nobility. It is a great principle in government; a principle at the very foundation of the whole &s;truc|ture. The other judges who held the &s;ame doc|trine, went beyond Lord Somers with regard to the remedy, which they thought was given by law again&s;t the crown, upon the grant of pen&s;ions. Indeed no man knows, when he cuts off the in|citements to a virtuous ambition, and the ju&s;t re|wards of public &s;ervice, what infinite mi&s;chief he may do his country, through all generations. Such &s;aving to the public may prove the wor&s;t mode of robbing it. The crown, which has in its hands the tru&s;t of the daily pay for national &s;ervice, ought to have in its hands al&s;o the means for the re|po&s;e of public labour, and the fixed &s;ettlement of acknowledged merit. There is a time, when the weather-beaten ve&s;&s;els of the &s;tate, ought to come into harbour. They mu&s;t at length have a retreat from the malice of rivals, from the perfidy of political friends, and the incon&s;tancy of the peo|ple. Many of the per&s;ons, who in all times have filled the great offices of &s;tate, have been younger brothers, who had originally little, if any fortune. The&s;e offices do not furni&s;h the means of ama&s;&s;ing wealth. There ought to be &s;ome power in the crown of granting pen&s;ions out of the reach of its own caprices. An intail of dependence is a bad reward of merit.</P>
<P>I would therefore leave to the crown the po&s;&s;i|bility of conferring &s;ome favours, which, whil&s;t they are received as a reward, do not operate as corruption. When men receive obligations from
<PB N="64" REF="65">
the crown through the pious hands of fathers, or of connections as venerable as the paternal, the dependences which ari&s;e from thence, are the obligations of gratitude, and not the fetters of &s;ervility. Such ties originate in virtue, and they promote it. They continue men in tho&s;e habi|tudes of friend&s;hip, tho&s;e political connections, and tho&s;e political principles in which they began life. They are antidotes again&s;t a corrupt levity, in&s;tead of cau&s;es of it. What an un&s;eemly &s;pectacle would it afford, what a di&s;grace would it be to the commonwealth that &s;uffered &s;uch things, to &s;ee the hopeful &s;on of a meritorious mini&s;ter beg|ging his bread at the door of that trea&s;ury, from whence his father di&s;pen&s;ed the oeconomy of an empire, and promoted the happine&s;s and glory of his country? Why &s;hould he be obliged to pro&s;|trate his honour, and to &s;ubmit his principles at the levee of &s;ome proud favourite, &s;houldered and thru&s;t a&s;ide by every impudent pretender, on the very &s;pot where a few days before he &s;aw him&s;elf adored?&mdash;obliged to cringe to the author of the calamities of his hou&s;e, and to ki&s;s the hands that are red with his father's blood?&mdash;No, Sir,&mdash;The&s;e things are unfit&mdash;They are intolerable.</P>
<P>Sir, I &s;hall be a&s;ked, why I do not chu&s;e to de&s;troy tho&s;e offices which are pen&s;ions, and appoint pen&s;ions under the direct title in their &s;tead? I allow, that in &s;ome ca&s;es it leads to abu&s;e; to have things appointed for one pur|po&s;e, and applied to another. I have no great objection to &s;uch a change: but I do not think it quite prudent for me to propo&s;e it. If I &s;hould take away the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, the burthen of proof re&s;ts upon me, that &s;o many pen&s;ions, and no more, and to &s;uch an amount each, and no more, are nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;ervice. This is what I can never prove: for it
<PB N="65" REF="66">
is a thing incapable of definition. I do not like to take away an object that I think an&s;wers my purpo&s;e, in hopes of getting it back again in a better &s;hape. People will bear an old e&s;tabli&s;h|ment when its exce&s;s is corrected, who will revolt at a new one. I do not think the&s;e office-pen&s;ions to be more in number than &s;ufficient: but on that point the Hou&s;e will exerci&s;e its di&s;cretion. As to abu&s;e, I am convinced, that very few tru&s;ts in the ordinary cour&s;e of admini&s;tration, have ad|mitted le&s;s abu&s;e than this. Efficient mini|&s;ters have been their own payma&s;ters. It is true. But their very partiality has operated as a kind of ju&s;tice; and &s;till it was &s;ervice that was paid. When we look over this exche|quer li&s;t, we find it filled with the de&s;cendants of the Walpoles, of the Pelhams, of the Town|&s;hends; names to whom this country owes its li|berties, and to whom his maje&s;ty owes his crown. It was in one of the&s;e lines, that the immen&s;e and envied employment he now holds, came to a cer|tain duke <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duke of Newca&s;tle, who&s;e dining-room is under the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE>, who is now probably &s;itting quietly at a very good dinner directly under us; and act|ing <HI>high life below &s;tairs,</HI> whil&s;t we, his ma&s;ters, are filling our mouths with un&s;ub&s;tantial &s;ounds, and talking of hungry oeconomy over his head. But he is the elder branch of an ancient and de|cayed hou&s;e, joined to, and repaired by the re|ward of &s;ervices done by another. I re&s;pect the original title, and the fir&s;t purcha&s;e of merited wealth and honour through all its de&s;cents, through all its transfers, and all its a&s;&s;ignments. May &s;uch fountains never be dried up. May they ever flow with their original purity, and refre&s;h and fructify the common wealth, for ages!</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="67">
Sir, I think my&s;elf bound to give you my rea&s;ons as clearly, and as fully, for &s;topping in the cour&s;e of reformation, as for proceeding in it. My limits are the rules of law; the rules of po|licy; and the &s;ervice of the &s;tate. This is the rea&s;on why I am not able to intermeddle with another article, which &s;eems to be a &s;pecific ob|ject in &s;everal of the petitions; I mean the reduc|tion of exorbitant emoluments to efficient offices. If I knew of any real efficient office, which did po&s;&s;e&s;s exorbitant emoluments, I &s;hould be ex|tremely de&s;irous of reducing them. Others may know of them. I do not. I am not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an exact common mea&s;ure between real &s;ervice and its reward. I am very &s;ure, that &s;tates do &s;ome|times receive &s;ervices, which is hardly in their power to reward according to their worth. If I were to give my judgment, with regard to this country, I do not think the great efficient offices of the &s;tate to be overpaid. The &s;ervice of the public is a thing which cannot be put to auction, and &s;truck down to tho&s;e who will agree to exe|cute it the cheape&s;t. When the proportion be|tween reward and &s;ervice, is our object, we mu&s;t always con&s;ider of what nature the &s;ervice is, and what &s;ort of men they are that mu&s;t perform it. What is ju&s;t payment for one kind of labour, and full encouragement for one kind of talents, is fraud and di&s;couragement to others. Many of the great offices have much duty to do, and much ex|pence of repre&s;entation to maintain. A &s;ecretary of &s;tate, for in&s;tance, mu&s;t not appear &s;ordid in the eyes of the mini&s;ters of other nations; neither ought our mini&s;ters abroad to appear contempti|ble in the courts where they re&s;ide. In all of|fices of duty, there is, almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, a great neglect of all dome&s;tic affairs. A per&s;on in high office can rarely take a view of his family-hou&s;e.
<PB N="67" REF="68">
If he &s;ees that the &s;tate takes no detriment, the &s;tate mu&s;t &s;ee that his affairs &s;hould take as little.</P>
<P>I will even go &s;o far as to affirm, that if men were willing to &s;erve in &s;uch &s;ituations without &s;alary, they ought not to be permitted to do it. Ordinary &s;ervice mu&s;t be &s;ecured by the motives to ordinary integrity. I do not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that, that &s;tate which lays its foundation in rare and heroic vir|tues, will be &s;ure to have its &s;uper&s;tructure in the ba&s;e&s;t profligacy and corruption. An honourable and fair profit is the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t avarice and rapacity; as in all things el&s;e, a lawful and regulated enjoyment is the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t debauchery and exce&s;s. For as wealth is power, &s;o all power will infallibly draw wealth to it&s;elf by &s;ome means or other: and when men are left no way of a&s;certaining their profits but by their means of obtaining them, tho&s;e means will be en|crea&s;ed to infinity. This is true in all the parts of admini&s;tration, as well as in the whole. If any individual were to decline his appointments, it might give an unfair advantage to o&s;tentati|ous ambition over unpretending &s;ervice; it might breed invidious compari&s;ons; it might tend to de&s;troy whatever little unity and agreement may be found among mini&s;ters. And after all, when an ambitious man had run down his competitors by a fallacious &s;hew of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and fixed him&s;elf in power by that means, what &s;ecu|rity is there that he would not change his cour&s;e, and claim as an indemnity ten times more than he has given up?</P>
<P>This rule, like every other, may admit its ex|ceptions. When a great man has &s;ome one great object in view to be atchieved in a given time, it may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to walk out of all the common roads, and if his fortune per|mits it, to hold him&s;elf out as a &s;plendid exam|ple. I am told, that &s;omething of this kind is
<PB N="68" REF="69">
now doing in a country near us. But this is for a &s;hort race; the training for a heat or two, and not the proper preparation for the regular &s;tages of a methodical journey. I am &s;peaking of e&s;tabli&s;hments, and not of men.</P>
<P>It may be expected, Sir, that when I am giv|ing my rea&s;ons why I limit my&s;elf in the reduction of employments, or of their profits, I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of tho&s;e which &s;eem of eminent inutility in the &s;tate; I mean the number of officers who by their places are attendant on the per&s;on of the king. Con&s;idering the commonwealth merely as &s;uch, and con&s;idering tho&s;e officers only as relative to the direct purpo&s;es of the &s;tate, I admit that they are of no u&s;e at all. But there are many things in the con&s;titution of e&s;tabli&s;hments, which appear of little value on the fir&s;t view, which in a &s;econdary and oblique manner, produce very ma|terial advantages. It was on full con&s;ideration that I determined not to le&s;&s;en any of the offices of honour about the crown, in their number or their emoluments. The&s;e emoluments, except in one or two ca&s;es, do not much more than an&s;wer the charge of attendance. Men of condition naturally love to be about a court; and women of condition love it much more. But there is in all regular at|tendance, &s;o much of con&s;traint, that if it were a mere charge, without any compen&s;ation, you would &s;oon have the court de&s;erted by all the nobility of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Sir, the mo&s;t &s;erious mi&s;chiefs would follow from &s;uch a de&s;ertion. Kings are naturally lovers of low company. They are &s;o elevated above all the re&s;t of mankind, that they mu&s;t look upon all their &s;ubjects as on a level. They are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility, on account of the occa&s;ional re&s;i&s;tance to their will, which will be made by their virtue, their petulance, or their pride. It mu&s;t indeed be admitted, that many of
<PB N="69" REF="70">
the nobility are as perfectly willing to act the part of flatterers, tale-bearers, para&s;ites, pimps, and buffoons, as any of the lowe&s;t and vile&s;t of mankind can po&s;&s;ibly be. But they are not pro|perly qualified for this object of their ambition. The want of a regular education, and early habits, and &s;ome lurking remains of their dignity, will ne|ver permit them to become a match for an Italian eunuch, a mountebank, a fidler, a player, or any regular practitioner of that tribe. The Roman emperors almo&s;t from the beginning, threw them|&s;elves into &s;uch hands; and the mi&s;chief increa&s;ed every day till its decline, and its final ruin. It is therefore of very great importance (provided the thing is not overdone) to contrive &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment as mu&s;t, almo&s;t whether a prince will or not, bring into daily and hourly offices about his per&s;on, a great number of his fir&s;t nobility; and it is rather an u&s;eful prejudice that gives them a pride in &s;uch a &s;ervitude. Though they are not much the better for a court, a court will be much the better for them. I have therefore not attempted to reform any of the offices of honour about the king's per&s;on.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, two offices in his &s;tables which are &s;inecures. By the change of manners, and indeed by the nature of the thing, they mu&s;t be &s;o; I mean the &s;everal keepers of buck-hounds, &s;tag-hounds, fox-hounds, and harriers. They an&s;wer no purpo&s;e of utility or of &s;plendor. The&s;e I propo&s;e to aboli&s;h. It is not proper that great noblemen &s;hould be keepers of dogs, though they were the king's dogs. In every part of my &s;cheme, I have endeavoured that no primary, and that even no &s;econdary &s;ervice of the &s;tate, &s;hould &s;uffer by its frugality. I mean to touch no offices but &s;uch as I am perfectly &s;ure, are either of no u&s;e at all, or not of any u&s;e in the lea&s;t a&s;&s;ignable propor|tion to the burthen with which they load the
<PB N="70" REF="71">
revenues of the kingdom, and to the influence with which they oppre&s;s the freedom of parliamentary deliberation; for which rea&s;on there are but two offices which are properly &s;tate offices, that I have a de&s;ire to reform.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them is the new office of <HI>third &s;ecretary of &s;tate,</HI> which is commonly called <HI>&s;ecre|tary of &s;tate for the colonies.</HI></P>
<P>We know that all the corre&s;pondence of the colonies had been, until within a few years, car|ried on by the &s;outhern &s;ecretary of &s;tate; and that this department has not been &s;hunned upon account of the weight of its duties; but on the contrary, much &s;ought, on account of its patronage. Indeed he mu&s;t be poorly acquainted with the hi&s;tory of office, who does not know how very lightly the A|merican functions have always leaned on the &s;houl|ders of the mini&s;terial <HI>Atlas,</HI> who has upheld that &s;ide of the &s;phere. Undoubtedly, great temper and judgment was requi&s;ite in the management of the colony politics; but the official detail was a trifle. Since the new appointment, a train of unfortunate accidents has brought before us al|mo&s;t the whole corre&s;pondence of this favourite &s;ecretary's office, &s;ince the fir&s;t day of its e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. I will &s;ay nothing of its au&s;picious foun|dation; of the quality of its corre&s;pondence; or of the effects that have en&s;ued from it. I &s;peak merely of its <HI>quantity;</HI> which we know would have been little or no addition to the trouble of whatever office had its hands the fulle&s;t. But what has been the real condition of the old office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate? Have their velvet bags, and their red boxes, been &s;o full, that nothing more could po&s;&s;ibly be crammed into them?</P>
<P>A corre&s;pondence of a curious nature has been lately publi&s;hed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Letters between Dr. Addington and Sir James Wright.</NOTE>. In that corre&s;pondence, Sir,
<PB N="71" REF="72">
we find, the opinion of a noble per&s;on, who is thought to be the grand manufacturer of ad|mini&s;trations; and therefore the be&s;t judge of the quality of his work. He was of opinion, that there was but one man of diligence and indu&s;try in the whole admini&s;tration&mdash;it was the late earl of Suf|folk. The noble lord lamented very ju&s;tly, that this &s;tate&s;man, of &s;o much mental vigour, was almo&s;t wholly di&s;abled from the exertion of it, by his bodily infirmities. Lord Suffolk, dead to the &s;tate, long before he was dead to nature, at la&s;t paid his tribute to the common trea&s;ury to which we mu&s;t all be taxed. But &s;o little want was found even of his intentional indu&s;try, that the office, vacant in reality to its duties long be|fore, continued vacant even in nomination and appointment for a year after his death. The whole of the laborious and arduous corre&s;pondence of this empire, re&s;ted &s;olely upon the activity and energy of Lord Weymouth.</P>
<P>It is therefore demon&s;trable, &s;ince one diligent man was fully equal to the duties of the two offices, that two diligent men will be equal to the duty of one. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the new office which I &s;hall propo&s;e to you to &s;uppre&s;s, is by no means too much to be returned to either of the &s;ecretaries which remain. If this du&s;t in the balance &s;hould be thought too heavy, it may be divided between them both; North America (whether free or redu|ced) to the northern &s;ecretary, the We&s;t Indies to the &s;outhern. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould &s;ay more upon the inutility of this office. It is burning day light. But before I have done, I &s;hall ju&s;t remark, that the hi&s;tory of this office is too recent to &s;uffer us to forget, that it was made for the mere convenience of the $$rangements of political intrigue, and not for the &s;ervice of the &s;tate; that it was made, in order to give a
<PB N="72" REF="73">
lour to an exorbitant increa&s;e of the civil li&s;t; and in the &s;ame act to bring a new acce&s;&s;ion to the loaded compo&s;t heap of corrupt influence.</P>
<P>There is, Sir, another office, which was not long &s;ince, clo&s;ely connected with this of the A|merican &s;ecretary; but has been lately &s;eparated from it for the very &s;ame purpo&s;e for which it had been conjoined; I mean the &s;ole purpo&s;e of all the &s;eparations and all conjunctions that have been lately made&mdash;a job.&mdash;I &s;peak, Sir, of the <HI>board of trade and plantations.</HI> This board is a &s;ort of temperate bed of influence; a &s;ort of gently ripening hot-hou&s;e, where eight members of Par|liament receive &s;alaries of a thou&s;and a year, for a certain given time, in order to mature at a pro|per &s;ea&s;on, a claim to two thou&s;and, granted for doing le&s;s, and on the credit of having toiled &s;o long in that inferior laborious department.</P>
<P>I have known that board, off and on, for a great number of years. Both of its pretended objects have been much the objects of my &s;tudy, if I have a right to call any pur&s;uits of mine by &s;o re&s;pectable a name. I can a&s;&s;ure the hou&s;e, and I hope they will not think that I ri&s;k my little credit lightly, that, without mean|ing to convey the lea&s;t reflection upon any one of its members pa&s;t or pre&s;ent,&mdash;it is a board which, if not mi&s;chievous, is of no u&s;e at all.</P>
<P>You will be convinced, Sir, that I am not mi&s;taken, if you reflect how generally it is true, that commerce, the principal object of that office, flouri&s;hes mo&s;t when it is left to it&s;elf. Intere&s;t, the great guide of commerce, is not a blind one. It is very well able to find its own way; and its nece&s;&s;ities are its be&s;t laws. But if it were po&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, that the young &s;hould direct the old, and the in|experienced in&s;truct the knowing; if a board in
<PB N="73" REF="74">
the &s;tate was the be&s;t tutor for the counting|hou&s;e; if the de&s;k ought to read lectures to the anvil, and the pen to u&s;urp the place of the &s;huttle&mdash;yet in any matter of regulation, we know that board mu&s;t act with as little au|thority as &s;kill. The prerogative of the crown is utterly inadequate to its object; becau&s;e all regulations are, in their nature, re&s;trictive of &s;ome liberty. In the reign indeed, of <HI>Charles the fir&s;t,</HI> the council, or committees of council, were ne|ver a moment unoccupied, with affairs of trade. But even where they had no ill intention (which was &s;ometimes the ca&s;e) trade and manufacture &s;uffered infinitely from their injudi|cious tampering. But &s;ince that period, when|ever regulation is wanting (for I do not deny, that &s;ometimes it may be wanting) parliament con&s;tantly &s;its; and parliament alone is compe|tent to &s;uch regulation. We want no in&s;truction from boards of trade, or from any other board; and God forbid we &s;hould give the lea&s;t atten|tion to their reports. Parliamentary enquiry is the only mode of obtaining parliamentary infor|mation. There is more real knowledge to be ob|tained, by attending the detail of bu&s;ine&s;s in the committees above &s;tairs, than ever did come, or ever will come from any board in this kingdom, or from all of them together. An a&s;&s;iduous mem|ber of parliament will not be the wor&s;e in&s;tructed there, for not being paid a thou&s;and a year for learning his le&s;&s;on. And now that I &s;peak of the committees above &s;tairs, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that having till lately attended them a good deal, I have ob&s;erved that no de&s;cription of members give &s;o little attendance, either to communicate, or to obtain in&s;truction upon matters of com|merce, as the honourable members of the grave board of trade. I really do not recollect,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
that I have ever &s;een one of them in that &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s. Po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ome members may have better memories; and may call to mind &s;ome job that may have accidentally brought one or other of them, at one time or other, to attend a matter of commerce.</P>
<P>This board, Sir, has had both its original for|mation, and its regeneration, in a job. In a job it was conceived, and in a job its mother brought it forth. It made one among tho&s;e &s;hewy and &s;pecious impo&s;itions, which one of the experi|ment-making admini&s;trations of <HI>Charles the &s;econd</HI> held out to delude the people, and to be &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in the place of the real &s;ervice which they might expect from a parliament annually &s;itting. It was intended al&s;o to corrupt that body when|ever it &s;hould be permitted to &s;it. It was pro|jected in the year 1668, and it continued in a tot|tering and rickety childhood for about three or four years, for it died in the year 1673, a babe of as little hopes as ever &s;welled the bills of mor|tality in the article of convul&s;ed or overlaid children, who have hardly &s;tepped over the thre&s;hold of life.</P>
<P>It was buried with little ceremony; and never more thought of, until the reign of <HI>King William,</HI> when in the &s;trange vici&s;&s;itude of neglect and vi|gour, of good and ill &s;ucce&s;s that attended his wars, in the year 1695, the trade was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed beyond all example of former &s;ufferings, by the piracies of the French crui&s;ers. This &s;uffering incen&s;ed, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, very ju&s;tly in|cen&s;ed, the hou&s;e of commons. In this ferment they &s;truck, not only at the admini&s;tration, but at the very con&s;titution of the executive govern|ment. They attempted to form in parliament a board for the protection of trade; which, as they planned it, was to draw to it&s;elf a great part, if
<PB N="75" REF="76">
not the whole, of the functions and powers, both of the admiralty, and of the trea&s;ury; and thus, by a parliamentary delegation of office and of|ficers, they threatened ab&s;olutely to &s;eparate the&s;e departments from the whole &s;y&s;tem of the execu|tive government, and of cour&s;e to ve&s;t the mo&s;t leading and e&s;&s;ential of its attributes in this board. As the executive government was in a manner convicted of a dereliction of its functions, it was with infinite difficulty, that this blow was ward|ed off in that &s;e&s;&s;ion. There was a threat to renew the &s;ame attempt in the next. To prevent the effect of this manoeuvre, the court oppo&s;ed another manoeuvre to it; and in the year 1696, called into life this board of trade, which had &s;lept &s;ince 1673.</P>
<P>This, in a few words, is the hi&s;tory of the rege|neration of the board of trade. It has perfectly an|&s;wered its purpo&s;es. It was intended to quiet the minds of the people, and to compo&s;e the ferment that then was &s;trongly working in parliament. The courtiers were too happy to be able to &s;ub&s;titute a board, which they knew would be u&s;ele&s;s, in the place of one that they feared would be dan|gerous. Thus the board of trade was repro|duced in a job; and perhaps it is the only in|&s;tance of a public body, which has never dege|nerated; but to this hour pre&s;erves all the health and vigour of its primitive in&s;titution.</P>
<P>This board of trade and plantations has not been of any u&s;e to the colonies, as colonies; &s;o little of u&s;e, that the flouri&s;hing &s;ettlements of New England, of Virginia, and of Maryland, and all our wealthy colonies in the We&s;t Indies, were of a date prior to the fir&s;t board of Charles the &s;e|cond. Pen&s;ylvania and Carolina were &s;ettled during its dark quarter, in the interval between the extinction of the fir&s;t, and the formation of
<PB N="76" REF="77">
the &s;econd board. Two colonies alone owe their origin to that board. Georgia, which, till lately, has made a very &s;low progre&s;s; and never did make any progre&s;s at all, until it had wholly got rid of all the regulations which the board of trade had moulded into its original con&s;titution. That colony has co&s;t the nation very great &s;ums of money; whereas the colonies which have had the fortune of not being godfathered by the board of trade, never co&s;t the nation a &s;hilling, except what has been &s;o properly &s;pent in lo&s;ing them. But the colony of Georgia, weak as it was, car|ried with it to the la&s;t hour, and carries, even in its pre&s;ent dead pallid vi&s;age, the perfect re&s;em|blance of its parents. It always had, and it now has, an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> paid by the public of Eng|land, for the &s;ake of the influence of the crown; that colony having never been able or willing to take upon it&s;elf the expence of its proper govern|ment, or its own appropriated jobs.</P>
<P>The province of Nova Scotia was the younge&s;t and the favourite child of the board. Good God! What &s;ums the nur&s;ing of that ill-thriven, hard-vi&s;aged, and ill-favoured brat, has co&s;t to this wittol nation? Sir, this colony has &s;tood us in a &s;um of not le&s;s than &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds. To this day it has made no repayment&mdash;It does not even &s;upport tho&s;e offices of ex|pence, which are mi&s;called its government; the whole of that job &s;till lies upon the patient, cal|lous &s;houlders of the people of England.</P>
<P>Sir, I am going to &s;tate a fact to you, that will &s;erve to &s;et in full &s;un&s;hine the real value of for|mality and official &s;uperintendance. There was in the province of Nova Scotia, one little ne|glected corner; the country of the <HI>neutral French;</HI> which having the good fortune to e&s;cape the fo&s;|tering care both of France and England, and to
<PB N="77" REF="78">
have been &s;hut out from the protection and regu|lation of councils of commerce, and of boards of trade, did, in &s;ilence, without notice, and without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, increa&s;e to a con&s;iderable de|gree. But it &s;eems our nation had more &s;kill and ability in de&s;troying, than in &s;ettling a colony. In the la&s;t war we did, in my opinion, mo&s;t in|humanly, and upon pretences that in the eye of an hone&s;t man are not worth a farthing, root out this poor innocent de&s;erving people, whom our utter inability to govern, or to reconcile, gave us no &s;ort of right to extirpate. Whatever the me|rits of that extirpation might have been, it was on the foot&s;teps of a neglected people, it was on the fund of uncon&s;trained poverty, it was on the acqui&s;itions of unregulated indu&s;try, that any thing which de&s;erves the name of a colony in that province, has been formed. It has been formed by overflowings from the exuberant population of New England, and by emigration, from other parts of Nova Scotia of fugitives from the pro|tection of the board of trade.</P>
<P>But if all of the&s;e things were not more than &s;ufficient to prove to you the inutility of that ex|pen&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hment, I would de&s;ire you to re|collect, Sir, that tho&s;e who may be very ready to defend it, are very cautious how they employ it; cautious how they employ it even in appear|ance and pretence. They are afraid they &s;hould lo&s;e the benefit of its influence in parliament, if they &s;eemed to keep it up for any other purpo&s;e. If ever there were commercial points of great weight, and mo&s;t clo&s;ely connected with our de|pendences, they are tho&s;e which have been agi|tated and decided in parliament &s;ince I came into it. Which of the innumerable regulations &s;ince made had their origin or their improvement in the board of trade? Did any of the &s;everal Ea&s;t India
<PB N="78" REF="79">
bills which have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively produced &s;ince 1767, originate there? Did any one dream of referring them, or any part of them thither? Was any body &s;o ridiculous as even to think of it? If ever there was an occa&s;ion on which the board was fit to be con&s;ulted, it was with regard to the acts, that were preludes to the American war, or at|tendant on its commencement: tho&s;e acts were full of commercial regulations, &s;uch as they were;&mdash;the intercour&s;e bill; the prohibitory bill; the fi&s;hery bill? If the board was not concern|ed in &s;uch things, in what particular was it thought fit that it &s;hould be concerned? In the cour&s;e of all the&s;e bills through the hou&s;e, I ob|&s;erved the members of that board to be remark|ably cautious of intermeddling. They under&s;tood decorum better; they know that matters of trade and plantations are no bu&s;ine&s;s of theirs.</P>
<P>There were two very recent occa&s;ions, on which, if the idea of any u&s;e for the board had not been extingui&s;hed by pre&s;cription, appeared loudly to call for their interference.</P>
<P>When commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent to pay his ma|je&s;ty's and our dutiful re&s;pects to the congre&s;s of the United States, a part of their powers un|der the commi&s;&s;ion were, it &s;eems, of a commer|cial nature. They were authorized in the mo&s;t ample and undefined manner, to form a com|mercial treaty with America on the &s;pot. This was no trivial object. As the formation of &s;uch a treaty would nece&s;&s;arily have been no le&s;s than the breaking up of our whole commercial &s;y&s;tem, and the giving it an entire new form; one would imagine, that the board of trade would have &s;at day and night, to model propo&s;itions, which, on our &s;ide, might &s;erve as a ba&s;is to that treaty. No &s;uch thing. Their learned lei&s;ure was not in the lea&s;t interrupted, though one of the members
<PB N="79" REF="80">
of the board was a commi&s;&s;ioner, and might, in mere compliment to his office, have been &s;uppo&s;ed to make a &s;hew of deliberation on the &s;ubject. But he knew, that his colleagues would have thought he laughed in their faces, had he at|tempted to bring any thing the mo&s;t di&s;tantly re|lating to commerce or colonies before <HI>them.</HI> A noble per&s;on, engaged in the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ent to learn his commercial rudiments in New York, (then under the operation of an act for the univer&s;al prohibition of trade) was &s;oon af|ter put at the head of that board. This con|tempt from the pre&s;ent mini&s;ters of all the pre|tended functions of that board, and their manner of breathing into its very &s;oul, of in&s;piring it with its animating and pre&s;iding principle, puts an end to all di&s;pute concerning their opinion of the clay it was made of. But I will give them heaped mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It was but the other day, that the noble lord in the blue ribbon carried up to the hou&s;e of peers, two acts, altering, I think much for the better, but altering, in a great degree, our whole commercial &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e acts, I mean, for giving a free trade to Ireland in woollens and in all things el&s;e, with independent nations, and giving them an equal trade to our own colo|nies. Here too the novelty of this great, but ar|duous and critical improvement of &s;y&s;tem, would make you conceive that the anxious &s;olicitude of the noble lord in the blue ribbon, would have wholly de&s;troyed the plan of &s;ummer recreation of that board, by references to examine, compare, and dige&s;t matters for parliament&mdash;You would imagine, that Iri&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners of cu&s;toms and Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners of cu&s;toms, and commi&s;|&s;ioners of exci&s;e, that merchants and manufactu|rers of every denomination, had daily crowded
<PB N="80" REF="81">
their outer rooms. <HI>Nil horum.</HI> The perpetual virtual adjournment, and the unbroken &s;itting vacation of that board, was no more di&s;turbed by the Iri&s;h than by the plantation commerce, or any other commerce. The &s;ame matter made a large part of the bu&s;ine&s;s which occupied the hou&s;e for two &s;e&s;&s;ions before; and as our mi|ni&s;ters were not then mellowed by the mild, emol|lient, and engaging blandi&s;hments of our dear &s;i&s;ter, into all the tenderne&s;s of unqualified &s;ur|render, the bounds and limits of a re&s;crained bene|fit naturally required much detailed management and po&s;itive regulation. But neither the quali|fied propo&s;itions which were received, nor tho&s;e other qualified propo&s;itions which were rejected by mini&s;ters, were the lea&s;t concern of theirs, or were they ever thought of in the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It is therefore, Sir, on the opinion of parlia|ment, on the opinion of the mini&s;ters, and even on their own opinion of their inutility, that I &s;hall propo&s;e to you to <HI>&s;uppre&s;s the board of trade and plantations;</HI> and to recommit all its bu&s;ine&s;s to the council from whence it was very improvidently taken; and which bu&s;ine&s;s (whatever it might be) was much better done and without any expence; and indeed where in effect it may all come at la&s;t. Almo&s;t all that de&s;erves the name of bu&s;ine&s;s there, is the reference of the planta|tion acts, to the opinion of gentlemen of the law. But all this may be done, as the Iri&s;h bu|&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ame nature has always been done, by the council, and with a reference to the attor|ney and &s;olicitor general.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome regulations in the hou&s;ehold, re|lative to the officers of the yeomen of the guards, and the officers and band of gentlemen pen|&s;ioners, which I &s;hall likewi&s;e &s;ubmit to your
<PB N="81" REF="82">
con&s;ideration, for the purpo&s;e of regulating e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, which at pre&s;ent are much abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed all, that for the pre&s;ent I &s;hall trouble you with on the <HI>plan of reduction.</HI> I mean next to propo&s;e to you the <HI>plan of arrange|ment,</HI> by which I mean to appropriate and fix the civil li&s;t money to its &s;everal &s;ervices according to their nature; for I am thoroughly &s;en&s;ible, that if a di&s;cretion, wholly arbitrary, can be exerci&s;ed over the civil li&s;t revenue, although the mo&s;t effec|tual methods may be taken to prevent the inferior departments from exceeding their bounds, the plan of reformation will &s;till be left very imperfect. It will not, in my opinion, be &s;afe to permit an entirely arbitrary di&s;cretion even in the fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury him&s;elf: It will not be &s;afe to leave with him a power of diverting the public money from its proper objects, of paying it in an irregular cour&s;e, or of inverting perhaps the order of time, dictated by the proportion of va|lue, which ought to regulate his application of payment to &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible too, that the very operation of a plan of oeconomy which tends to exonerate the civil li&s;t of expen&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hments, may in &s;ome &s;ort defeat the capital end we have in view, the independence of parliament; and that in re|moving the public and o&s;ten&s;ible means of influ|ence, we may increa&s;e the fund of private cor|ruption. I have thought of &s;ome methods to pre|vent an abu&s;e of &s;urplus ca&s;h under di&s;cretionary application; I mean the heads of <HI>&s;ecret &s;ervice, &s;pecial &s;ervice, various payments,</HI> and the like; which, I hope, will an&s;wer, and which in due time I &s;hall lay before you. Where I am unable to limit the quantity of the &s;ums to be applied, by rea&s;on of the uncertain quantity of the &s;ervice, I endeavour to confine it to its <HI>line;</HI> to &s;ecure
<PB N="82" REF="83">
an indefinite application to the definite &s;ervice to which it belongs; not, to &s;top the progre&s;s of expence in its line, but to confine it to that line in which it profe&s;&s;es to move.</P>
<P>But that part of my plan, Sir, upon which I principally re&s;t, that, on which I rely for the pur|po&s;e of binding up, and &s;ecuring the whole, is to e&s;tabli&s;h a fixed and invariable order in all its payments, which it &s;hall not be permitted to the fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury, upon any pretence what|&s;oever, to depart from. I therefore divide the ci|vil li&s;t payments into <HI>nine</HI> cla&s;&s;es, putting each cla&s;s forward according to the importance or ju&s;|tice of the demand, and to the inability of the per&s;ons entitled to enforce their preten&s;ions; that is, to put tho&s;e fir&s;t who have the mo&s;t efficient offices, or claim the ju&s;te&s;t debts; and, at the &s;ame time, from the character of that de&s;crip|tion of men, from the retiredne&s;s, or the re|motene&s;s of their &s;ituation, or from their want of weight and power to enforce their preten&s;ions, or from their being entirely &s;ubject to the power of a mini&s;ter, without any reciprocal power of awe|ing him, ought to be the mo&s;t con&s;idered, and are the mo&s;t likely to be neglected; all the&s;e I place in the highe&s;t cla&s;&s;es: I place in the lowe&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e functions are of the lea&s;t importance, but who&s;e per&s;ons or rank are often of the greate&s;t power and influence.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t cla&s;s I place the <HI>judges,</HI> as of the fir&s;t importance. It is the public ju&s;tice that holds the community together; the ea&s;e, therefore, and independence of the judges, ought to &s;uper&s;ede all other con&s;iderations, and they ought to be the very la&s;t to feel the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate, or to be obliged either to court or bully a mini&s;ter for their right: They ought to be as <HI>weak &s;olici|tors on their own demands,</HI> as &s;trenuous a&s;&s;ertors of
<PB N="83" REF="84">
the rights and liberties of others. The judges are, or ought to be, of a <HI>re&s;erved</HI> and retired character, and wholly unconnected with the po|litical world.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd cla&s;s I place the foreign mini|&s;ters. The judges are the links of our connec|tions with one another; the foreign mini&s;ters are the links of our connection with other nations. They are not upon the &s;pot to demand pay|ment, and are therefore the mo&s;t likely to be, as in fact they have &s;ometimes been, entirely neglected, to the great di&s;grace, and perhaps the great detri|ment of the nation.</P>
<P>In the third cla&s;s I would bring all the trade&s;|men who &s;upply the crown by contract, or other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>In the fourth cla&s;s I place all the dome&s;tic &s;ervants of the king, and all per&s;ons in efficient offices, who&s;e &s;alaries do not exceed two hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>In the fifth, upon account of honour, which ought to give place to nothing but charity and rigid ju&s;tice, I would place the pen&s;ions and allow|ances of his maje&s;ty's royal family, comprehend|ing of cour&s;e the queen, together with the &s;tated allowance of the privy pur&s;e.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth cla&s;s, I place the&s;e efficient offices of duty, who&s;e &s;alaries may exceed the &s;um of two hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>In the &s;eventh cla&s;s, that mixed ma&s;s, the whole pen&s;ion li&s;t.</P>
<P>In the eighth, the offices of honour about the king.</P>
<P>In the ninth and the la&s;t of all, the &s;alaries and pen&s;ions of the fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury him&s;elf, the chancellor of the exchequer, and the other commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>If by any po&s;&s;ible mi&s;management of that part
<PB N="84" REF="85">
of the revenue which is left at di&s;cretion, or by any other mode of prodigality, ca&s;h &s;hould be deficient for the payment of the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es, I propo&s;e, that the amount of tho&s;e &s;alaries where the deficiency may happen to fall, &s;hall not be carried as debt to the account of the &s;ucceed|ing year, but that it &s;hall be entirely lap&s;ed, &s;unk, and lo&s;t; &s;o that government will be enabled to &s;tart in the race of every new year, wholly un|loaded, fre&s;h in wind and in vigour. Hereafter, no civil li&s;t debt can ever come upon the pub|lic. And tho&s;e who do not con&s;ider this as &s;av|ing, becau&s;e it is not a certain &s;um, do not ground their calculations of the future on their experience of the pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I know of no mode of pre&s;erving the effectual execution of any duty, but to make it the direct intere&s;t of the executive officer that it &s;hall be faithfully performed. A&s;&s;uming, then, that the pre&s;ent va&s;t allowance to the civil li&s;t is perfectly adequate to all its purpo&s;es, if there &s;hould be any failure, it mu&s;t be from the mi&s;management or neglect of the fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea|&s;ury; &s;ince, upon the propo&s;ed plan, there can be no expence of any con&s;equence, which he is not him&s;elf previou&s;ly to authorize and finally to control. It is therefore ju&s;t, as well as politic, that the lo&s;s &s;hould attach upon the delinquency.</P>
<P>If the failure from the delinquency &s;hould be very con&s;iderable, it will fall on the cla&s;s directly above the fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury, as well as upon him|&s;elf and his board. It will fall, as it ought to fall, upon offices of no primary importance in the &s;tate; but then it will fall upon per&s;ons, whom it will be a matter of no &s;light importance for a mini&s;ter to provoke&mdash;it will fall upon per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank and con&s;equence in the kingdom; upon tho&s;e who are neare&s;t to the king, and
<PB N="85" REF="86">
frequently have a more interior credit with him than the mini&s;ter him&s;elf. It will fall upon ma&s;ters of the hor&s;e, upon lord chamberlains, upon lord &s;tewards, upon grooms of the &s;tole, and lords of the bedchamber. The hou&s;hold troops form an army, who will be ready to mutiny for want of pay, and who&s;e mutiny will be <HI>really</HI> dreadful to a commander in chief. A rebellion of the thir|teen lords of the bedchamber would be far more terrible to a mini&s;ter, and would probably affect his power more to the quick, than a revolt of thirteen colonies. What an uproar &s;uch an event would create at court! What <HI>petitions,</HI> and <HI>com|mittees,</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ociations</HI> would it not produce! Ble&s;s me! what a clattering of white &s;ticks and yellow &s;ticks would be about his head&mdash;what a &s;torm of gold keys would fly about the ears of the mini&s;ter&mdash;what a &s;hower of Georges, and Thi&s;tles, and me|dals, and collars of S. S. would a&s;&s;ail him at his fir&s;t entrance into the antichamber, after an in&s;olvent Chri&s;tmas quarter. A tumult which could not be appea&s;ed by all the harmony of the new-year's ode. Rebellion it is certain there would be; and rebellion may not now indeed be &s;o critical an event to tho&s;e who engage in it, &s;ince its price is &s;o correctly a&s;certained;&mdash;a&s;cer|tained at ju&s;t a thou&s;and pound.</P>
<P>Sir, this cla&s;&s;ing, in my opinion, is a &s;erious and &s;olid &s;ecurity for the performance of a mini&s;ter's duty. Lord Coke &s;ays, that the &s;taff was put into the trea&s;urer's hand, to enable him to &s;upport him&s;elf when there was no money in the exchequer, and to beat away importunate &s;olicitors. The method, which I propo&s;e, would hinder him from the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a broken &s;taff to lean on, or &s;uch a mi&s;erable weapon for repul&s;ing the demands of worthle&s;s &s;uitors, who, the noble lord in the blue ribbon knows, will
<PB N="86" REF="87">
bear many hard blows on the head, and many other indignities, before they are driven from the trea&s;ury. In this plan, he is furni&s;hed with an an&s;wer to all their importunity; <Q>an an&s;wer far more conclu&s;ive, than if he had knocked them down with his &s;taff&mdash;&startq;Sir, (or my Lord), you are calling for my own &s;alary&mdash;Sir, you are calling for the appointments of my colleagues who &s;it about me in office&mdash;Sir, you are going to excite a mutiny at court again&s;t me&mdash;you are going to e&s;trange his maje&s;ty's confidence from me, through the chamberlain, or the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, or the groom of the &s;tole.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>As things now &s;tand, every man, in propor|tion to his con&s;equence at court, tends to add to the expences of the civil li&s;t, by all manner of jobs, if not for him&s;elf, yet for his dependents. When the new plan is e&s;tabli&s;hed, tho&s;e who are now &s;uitors for jobs, will become the mo&s;t &s;trenuous oppo&s;ers of them. They will have a common intere&s;t with the mini&s;ter in public oeco|nomy. Every cla&s;s, as it &s;tands low, will be|come &s;ecurity for the payment of the preceding cla&s;s; and thus the per&s;ons, who&s;e in&s;ignificant &s;ervices defraud tho&s;e that are u&s;eful, would then become intere&s;ted in their payment. Then the powerful, in&s;tead of oppre&s;&s;ing, would be obliged to &s;upport the weak; and idlene&s;s would become concerned in the reward of indu&s;try. The whole fabric of the civil oeconomy would become compact and connected in all its parts; it would be formed into a well organized&punc; body, where every member contributes to the &s;upport of the whole; and where even the lazy &s;tomach &s;e|cures the vigour of the active arm.</P>
<P><Q>This plan, I really flatter my&s;elf, is laid, not in official formality, nor in airy &s;peculation, but in real life, and in human nature, in what
<PB N="87" REF="88">
&startq;comes home (as Bacon &s;ays) to the bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;oms of men.&endq;</Q> You have now, Sir, before you, the whole of my &s;cheme, as far as I have dige&s;ted it into a form, that might be in any re&s;pect worthy of your con&s;ideration.&mdash;I in|tend to lay it before you in five bills <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titles of the Bills read.</NOTE>. The plan con&s;i&s;ts, indeed, of many parts; but they &s;tand upon a few plain principles. It is a plan which takes nothing from the civil li&s;t with|out di&s;charging it of a burthen equal to the &s;um carried to the public &s;ervice. It weakens no one function nece&s;&s;ary to government; but on the contrary, by appropriating &s;upply to &s;ervice, it gives it greater vigour. It provides the means of order and fore&s;ight to a mini&s;ter of finance, which may always keep all the objects of his office, and their &s;tate, condition, and relations, di&s;tinctly before him. It brings forward accounts without hurrying and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the accountants: whil&s;t it provides for public convenience, it regards private rights. It extingui&s;hes &s;ecret corruption almo&s;t to the po&s;&s;ibility of its exi&s;tence. It de|&s;troys direct and vi&s;ible influence equal to the offices of at lea&s;t fifty members of parliament. La&s;tly, it prevents the provi&s;ion for his Maje&s;ty's children, from being diverted to the political pur|po&s;es of his mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the points, on which I rely for the merit of the plan: I pur&s;ue oeconomy in a &s;econdary view, and only as it is connected with the&s;e great objects. I am per&s;uaded, that even for &s;upply, this &s;cheme will be far from unfruit|ful, if it be executed to the extent I propo&s;e it. I think it will give to the public, at its periods, two or three hundred thou&s;and pounds a year; if not, it will give them a &s;y&s;tem of oeconomy,
<PB N="88" REF="89">
which is it&s;elf a great revenue. It gives me no little pride and &s;atisfaction, to find that the prin|ciples of my proceedings are, in many re&s;pects, the very &s;ame with tho&s;e which are now pur&s;ued in the plans of the French mini&s;ter of finance. I am &s;ure, that I lay before you a &s;cheme ea&s;y and prac|ticable in all its parts. I know it is common at once to applaud and to reject all attempts of this nature. I know it is common for men to &s;ay, that &s;uch and &s;uch things are perfectly right&mdash;very de|&s;irable; but that, unfortunately, they are not practi|cable. Oh! no, Sir, no. Tho&s;e things which are not practicable, are not de&s;irable. There is nothing in the world really beneficial, that does not lie within the reach of an informed un|der&s;tanding, and a well directed pur&s;uit. There is nothing that God has judged good for us, that he has not given us the means to accompli&s;h, both in the natural and the moral world. If we cry, like children for the moon, like children we mu&s;t cry on.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t follow the nature of our affairs, and conform our&s;elves to our &s;ituation. If we do, our objects are plain and compa&s;&s;able. Why &s;hould we re&s;olve to do nothing, becau&s;e what I propo&s;e to you may not be the exact demand of the pe|tition; when we are far from re&s;olved to comply even with what evidently is &s;o? Does this &s;ort of chicanery become us? The people are the ma&s;|ters. They have only to expre&s;s their wants at large and in gro&s;s. We are the expert arti&s;ts; we are the &s;kilful workmen, to &s;hape their de&s;ires into perfect form, and to fit the uten&s;il to the u&s;e. They are the &s;ufferers, they tell the &s;ymptoms of the complaint; but we know the exact &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, and how to apply the remedy, ac|cording to the rules of art. How &s;hocking would it be to &s;ee us pervert our &s;kill, into a
<PB N="89" REF="90">
&s;ini&s;ter and &s;ervile dexterity, for the purpo&s;e of evading our duty, and defrauding our employers, who are our natural lords, of the object of their ju&s;t expectations. I think the whole not only practicable, but practicable in a very &s;hort time. If we are in earne&s;t about it, and if we exert that indu&s;try, and tho&s;e talents in forwarding the work, which I am afraid may be exerted in impeding it&mdash;I engage, that the whole may be put in complete execution within a year. For my own part, I have very little to recommend me for this or for any ta&s;k, but a kind of earne&s;t and anxious per&s;everance of mind, which, with all its good and all its evil effects, is moulded into my con&s;titution. I faithfully engage to the hou&s;e, if they choo&s;e to appoint me to any part in the execution of this work, which (when they have made it theirs by the improvements of their wi&s;dom, will be worthy of the able a&s;&s;i&s;tance they may give me) that by night and by day, in town, or in country, at the de&s;k, or in the fore&s;t, I will, without regard to convenience, ea&s;e, or plea&s;ure, devote my&s;elf to their &s;ervice, not expecting or admitting any reward what&s;o|ever. I owe to this country my labour, which is my all; and I owe to it ten times more indu&s;try, if ten times more I could exert. After all I &s;hall be an unprofitable &s;ervant.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, if I am able, and if I &s;hall be permitted, I will lend an humble helping hand to any other good work which is going on. I have not, Sir, the frantic pre&s;umption to &s;up|po&s;e, that this plan contains in it the whole of what the public has a right to expect, in the great work of reformation they call for. Indeed, it falls infinitely &s;hort of it. It falls &s;hort, even of my own ideas. I have &s;ome thoughts not yet
<PB N="90" REF="91">
fully ripened, relative to a reform in the cu&s;toms and exci&s;e, as well as in &s;ome other branches of financial admini&s;tration. There are other things too, which form e&s;&s;ential parts in a great plan for the purpo&s;e of re&s;toring the independence of parliament. The contractors bill of la&s;t year it is fit to revive; and I rejoice that it is in better hands than mine. The bill for &s;u&s;pending the votes of cu&s;tomhou&s;e officers, brought into parliament &s;everal years ago, by one of our wor|thie&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t members, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">W. Dowde&s;well, E&s;&abque; chancellor of the exchequer, 1765.</NOTE> (would to God we could along with the plan revive the per&s;on who propo&s;ed it.) But a man of very real integrity, honour, and ability will be found to take his place, and to carry his idea into full execu|tion. You all &s;ee how nece&s;&s;ary it is to review our military expences for &s;ome years pa&s;t, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to bind up and clo&s;e that bleeding artery of profu&s;ion: but that bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o, I have rea&s;on to hope, will be undertaken by abi|lities that are fully adequate to it. Something mu&s;t be devi&s;ed (if po&s;&s;ible) to check the ruinous expence of elections.</P>
<P>Sir, all or mo&s;t of the&s;e things mu&s;t be done. Every one mu&s;t take his part.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould be able by dexterity or power, or intrigue, to di&s;appoint the expectations of our con&s;tituents, what will it avail us? we &s;hall never be &s;trong or artful enough to parry, or to put by the irre&s;i&s;tible demands of our &s;ituation. That &s;ituation calls upon us, and upon our con&s;titu|ents too, with a voice which <HI>will</HI> be heard. I am &s;ure no man is more zealou&s;ly attached than I am to the privileges of this hou&s;e, particularly in regard to the exclu&s;ive management of money. The lords have no right to the di&s;po&s;ition, in any &s;en&s;e, of the public pur&s;e; but they have

gone further in <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the Debate on the Rejection of Lord Shelburne's motion in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE> &s;elf-denial than our utmo&s;t jealou&s;y could have required. A power of exa|mining accounts, to cen&s;ure, correct, and puni&s;h, we never, that I know of, have thought of de|nying to the Hou&s;e of Lords. It is &s;omething more than a century &s;ince we voted that body u&s;ele&s;s: they have now voted them&s;elves &s;o. The whole hope of reformation is at length ca&s;t upon <HI>us;</HI> and let us not deceive the nation, which does us the honour to hope every thing from our virtue. If <HI>all</HI> the nation are not equally forward to pre&s;s this duty upon us, yet be a&s;&s;ured, that they all equally expect we &s;hould perform it. The re&s;pectful &s;ilence of tho&s;e who wait upon your plea&s;ure, ought to be as powerful with you, as the call of tho&s;e who require your &s;ervice as their right. Some, without doors, affect to feel hurt for your dignity, becau&s;e they &s;up|po&s;e, that menaces are held out to you. Ju&s;tify their good opinion, by &s;hewing that no menaces are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;timulate you to your duty.&mdash;But, Sir, whil&s;t we may &s;ympathize with them, in one point, who &s;ympathize with us in another, we ought to attend no le&s;s to tho&s;e who approach us like men, and who, in the gui&s;e of petitioners, &s;peak to us in the tone of a concealed authority. It is not wi&s;e to force them to &s;peak out more plainly, what they plainly mean.&mdash;But, the petitioners are vio|lent. Be it &s;o. Tho&s;e who are lea&s;t anxious about your conduct, are not tho&s;e that love you mo&s;t. Moderate affection and &s;atiated enjoyment, are cold and re&s;pectful; but an ardent and injured pa&s;&s;ion, is tempered up with wrath, and grief, and &s;hame, and con&s;cious worth, and the maddening

&s;en&s;e of violated right. A jealous love lights his torch from the firebrands of the furies.&mdash;They who call upon you to belong <HI>wholly</HI> to the peo|ple, are tho&s;e who wi&s;h you to return to your <HI>proper</HI> home; to the &s;phere of your duty, to the po&s;t of your honour, to the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of all genuine, &s;erene, and &s;olid &s;atisfaction. We have furni&s;hed to the people of England (indeed we have) &s;ome real cau&s;e of jealou&s;y. Let us leave that &s;ort of company which, if it does not de&s;troy our innocence, pollutes our honour: let us free our&s;elves at once from every thing that can in|crea&s;e their &s;u&s;picions, and inflame their ju&s;t re|&s;entment: let us ca&s;t away from us, with a gene|rous &s;corn, all the love-tokens and &s;ymbols that we have been vain and light enough to accept;&mdash;all the bracelets and &s;nuff-boxes, and miniature pictures, and hair-devices, and all the other adul|terous trinkets that are the pledges of our alienation, and the monuments of our &s;hame. Let us return to our legitimate home, and all jars and all quar|rels will be lo&s;t in embraces. Let the commons in parliament a&s;&s;embled, be one and the &s;ame thing with the commons at large. The di&s;tinctions that are made to &s;eparate us, are unnatural and wicked contrivances. Let us identify, let us incorporate our&s;elves with the people. Let us cut all the cables and &s;nap the chains which tie us to an unfaithful &s;hore, and enter the friendly harbour, that &s;hoots far out into the main its moles and jettees to receive us.&mdash;"War with the world, and peace with our con&s;tituents." Be this our motto and our principle. Then indeed, we &s;hall be truly great. Re&s;pecting our&s;elves, we &s;hall be re&s;pected by the world. At pre&s;ent all is troubled and cloudy, and di&s;tracted, and full of anger and turbulence, both abroad and at home:

but the air may be cleared by this &s;torm, and light and fertility may follow it. Let us give a faithful pledge to the people, that we honour, indeed, the crown; but that we <HI>belong</HI> to them; that we are their auxiliaries, and not their ta&s;k|ma&s;ters; the fellow-labourers in the &s;ame vine|yard, not lording over their rights, but helpers of their joy: that to tax them is a grievance to our&s;elves, but to cut off from our enjoyments to forward theirs, is the highe&s;t gratification we are capable of receiving. I feel with comfort, that we are all warmed with the&s;e &s;entiments, and while we are thus warm, I wi&s;h we may go di|rectly and with a chearful heart to this &s;alutary work.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Sir, I move for leave to bring in a Bill, For the better regulation of his Maje&s;ty's civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, and of certain public of|fices; for the limitation of pen&s;ions, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;undry u&s;ele&s;s, expen&s;ive, and inconvenient places; and for applying the monies &s;aved thereby to the public &s;ervice.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Fox &s;econded the motion.</P>
<P>Lord North &s;tated, that there was a difference between this bill for regulating the e&s;tabli&s;hments, and &s;ome of the others, as they affected the antient patrimony of the crown; and therefore wi&s;hed them to be po&s;tponed, till the King's con&s;ent could be obtained. This di&s;tinction was &s;trongly contro|verted; but when it was in&s;i&s;ted on as a point of decorum <HI>only,</HI> it was agreed to po&s;tpone them to another day. Accordingly, on the Monday fol|lowing, viz. Feb. 14, leave was given, on the
