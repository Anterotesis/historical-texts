<HEAD>PREFACE&mdash;by TIM.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we are delighted with the writings of an author, as I make no doubt but every &s;en&s;ible reader of the following poem will be, we naturally have a de&s;ire to be acquainted with his private hi&s;tory and character; that this ob&s;ervation is true, is manife&s;t from its having been made fifty thou&s;and times, and therefore it &s;hall &s;erve me to introduce the very brief account I &s;hall at pre&s;ent give of poor Peter, the Author of this excellent Satire&mdash;Know then, gentle Reader, Peter was born in the north of England, of hone&s;t though but poor parents, and edu|cated at a good Grammar-School, from which his Father, again&s;t Peter's inclinations, took him away to bind him apprentice to a Tanner, an occupation he did not greatly approve, for he could never endure the &s;mell of hides; he had not been in this &s;ituation above a year before his Father died, upon which Peter run away from his Indentures, and went and re&s;ided &s;ome time with an intimate acquaintance who had been his
<PB N="viii" REF="4">&s;chool-fellow; this per&s;on was a man of polite ta&s;te, and a good cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar: by his con|ver&s;ation Peter &s;o greatly improved his genius, which was naturally poetical, that he compo&s;ed &s;everal Pa&s;torals and &s;ome rural de&s;criptions, by which he acquired great reputation&mdash;The Love of Glory, and an ardent de&s;ire to conver&s;e with the Learned, brought him up to Town the lat|ter end of the year 1753: He flattered him&s;elf that he &s;hould be able to procure a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by his &s;cattered poetical performances; but alas he was mi&s;taken! for that kind of merit is not now encouraged&mdash;all the money he ever received for his works was only one Guinea of a Book&s;eller for an excellent Poem, by which I have heard the Proprietor got a hundred. This general di&s;couragement depre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirits to &s;uch a degree, that it threw him into a &s;ort of a melancholy, which in a &s;hort time put a period to his exi&s;tence, for he died the beginning of this month to the inexpre&s;&s;ible grief of all his acquaintance&mdash;In his Box was found fairly tran&s;cribed for the pre&s;s, a Poem in two Books, the fir&s;t of which we now &s;ubmit to the Public; if it meets with encouragement the &s;econd may &s;hortly make its appearance&mdash;</P>

The Patents of the&s;e dignities, together with all the others he has received from the courts and univer|&s;ities abroad, are in the hands of his &s;on in London.

That he is the author of 24 different works that he has wrote him&s;elf in different languages, three of which are pub|li&s;hed in Italian. And, to complete all, he was received as a member of the univer&s;ity of Padua by Order of the &s;enate of Venice, with di&s;tinct approbation from the famous profe&s;&s;or Morgany: And this crowned by the dignities he has received from the court and &s;enate of Rome.
