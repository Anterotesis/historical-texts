<HEAD>The Wonderful Old Man.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by <HI>George Alexander Steevens.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>Tune&mdash;<HI>Derry Down.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>THERE was an Old Man, and tho' it's not common,</L>
<L>Yet if he &s;aid true, he was born of a woman;</L>
<L>And, tho' it's incredible, yet I've been told</L>
<L>He was once a meer infant, but age made him old.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whene'er he was hungry, he long'd for &s;ome meat,</L>
<L>And if he could get it, 'twas &s;aid he would eat;</L>
<L>When thir&s;ty, he'd drink, if you gave him a pot,</L>
<L>And the liquor mo&s;t commonly ran down his throat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He &s;eldom or ever could &s;ee without light,</L>
<L>And yet I've been told he could hear in the night:</L>
<L>He has oft been awake in the day-time, 'tis &s;aid,</L>
<L>And has fallen a&s;leep as he lay in his bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis reported his tongue always mov'd when he talk'd,</L>
<L>And he &s;tirr'd both his legs and his arms as he walk'd,</L>
<L>His gait was &s;o odd, had you &s;een him, you'd bur&s;t,</L>
<L>For one leg or t'other wou'd always be fir&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His face was the odde&s;t that ever was &s;een,</L>
<L>For if 'twas not wa&s;h'd, it was &s;eldom quite clean;</L>
<L>He &s;hew'd mo&s;t his teeth, if he happen'd to grin,</L>
<L>And his mouth &s;tood acro&s;s 'twixt his no&s;e &amp; his chin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length he fell &s;ick, as old chronicles tell,</L>
<L>And then, as they &s;ay, he was not very well;</L>
<L>But what is more &s;trange! in &s;o weak a condition,</L>
<L>As he cou'd not give fees, he cou'd get no phy&s;ician.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What pity he dy'd! yet 'tis &s;aid that his death</L>
<L>Was occa&s;ion'd at la&s;t by the want of his breath;</L>
<L>But peace to his bones that in a&s;hes now moulder,</L>
<L>Had he liv'd a day longer, he'd been a day older!</L>
