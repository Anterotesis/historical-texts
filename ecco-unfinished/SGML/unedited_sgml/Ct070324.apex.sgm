<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_AT the fir&s;t Appearance of this Treati&s;e, I make no Doubt of its being taken for &s;uch another Ro|mance as <HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;o;</HI> but whoever expects to find here the &s;ine Inventions of a prolifick Brain will be de|ceiv'd; for &s;o far as every Body concern'd in the Publication knows, it is nothing el&s;e but a plain, hone&s;t Narrative of Matter of Fact. The Original was wrote by <HI>Robert Drury,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ting of eight Quires in <HI>Folio,</HI> each of near an hundred Pages, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to contract it, and put it in a more agreeable Method: But he con&s;tantly attended the Tran&s;criber, and al&s;o the Printer, &s;o that the utmo&s;t Care has been taken to be well in|form'd of every dubious, &s;trange, and intri|$te Circum&s;tance. And as to the large Pro|$tion of Credit which we give him, it will $word$ &s;ound not to ari&s;e from an implicit Faith, $word$ every Thing he might think proper to re|late;
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
but from the &s;trong Proof the Matters related receive by concurring Te&s;timony, and the Nature of the Thing.</P>
<P>I at fir&s;t wonder'd how Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> ven|tur'd to &s;ay in his Certificate, <HI>That he believ'd the Account he gave of his &s;urpri&s;ing Adven|tures to be true:</HI> But inquiring into the Cha|racter of that Gentleman, I found him to he a Per&s;on of the highe&s;t Reputation for Inte|grity and Honour; to which if we add, his known Solidity and good Sen&s;e, his Fortune, and Station of Life; there is no Room left to &s;uppo&s;e he would countenance any trifling Fa|bles or Impo&s;itions; yet this did not fully &s;a|tisfy me, till diligently peru&s;ing the Hi&s;tory, we find at <HI>Yong-Owl,</HI> where he took the Author on Board, <HI>William Pur&s;er</HI> was their Lingui&s;t for &s;everal Months, and he &s;peaking <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> perfectly, 'tis not doubted but this Gentleman, as well as the Captains of the other Ships, in|form'd them&s;elves by his Means all they could of &s;o &s;ingular and remarkable a Ca&s;e. Now 'tis to be ob&s;erv'd, that this <HI>William Pur&s;er</HI> was a Native of <HI>Feraingher,</HI> knew Mr. <HI>Drury</HI> there, and was an Eye-Witne&s;s to his carry|ing the <HI>Elodge</HI> in their Expedition to <HI>Antern|droea,</HI> and to &s;everal other the other mo&s;t doubtful Circum&s;tances here related, and his Adventures for &s;everal Years together.</P>
<P>After this, the Captain went to <HI>Munnon|garo,</HI> alias <HI>Ma&s;&s;alege,</HI> where he &s;aw <HI>Nich Dove,</HI> one of the Boys &s;hip-wreck'd in the <HI>De|grave,</HI> and &s;av'd in the Ma&s;&s;acre in <HI>Antern+droca;</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="5">
&s;o that it was in the Captain's Power to come at more than two Thirds of what is contain'd in this Hi&s;tory, be&s;ides the Opportu|nity of conver&s;ing with him in their long Voy|age to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> and after to <HI>England.</HI> The &s;econd Voyage which <HI>Drury</HI> made was al|&s;o in Capt. <HI>Macket</HI>'s Service, tho' not in the Ship commanded by him&s;elf; yet he was a principal Proprietor in the Ship and Cargo commanded by Capt. <HI>White,</HI> as well as of his own and &s;ome others; the Captain al&s;o con|firm'd this to me in Conver&s;ation, adding <HI>That he had &s;een others in his la&s;t Voyage there, as well Natives who &s;pake</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>and knew</HI> Drury, <HI>as &s;ome who were &s;av'd by Flight with Capt.</HI> Drummond, <HI>with this material Particular, That this very Captain</HI> Drummond <HI>was the Man whom</HI> Drury <HI>&s;up|po&s;es him to be; and that he was kill'd at</HI> Tullea, <HI>&s;even Leagues to the Northward of</HI> Augu&s;tine Bay, <HI>by one</HI> Lewes, <HI>a Jamaica Negro.</HI> This Gentleman continu'd his Friend|&s;hip for <HI>Drury,</HI> even to be his Patron to this Day, which he wou'd not have done, had he not known him to be a Per&s;on of Innocence and Probity, tho' his own well-known Life and Conver&s;ation does &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate this; &s;o that on the whole, I think, we have no Rea&s;on to doubt his Veracity in any mate|rial Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Account here given of the Religion of the&s;e People, may be thought by &s;ome to be in|vented by the Tran&s;criber to &s;erve an End, or
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
Inclination of his own, but &s;o far is this from being the Ca&s;e, that the mo&s;t to-be-&s;u&s;pected Part of the Account of this Religion is Fact, as related by <HI>Drury;</HI> and particularly the re|markable Co$$errence with <HI>Deaan Murnan|zack,</HI> his ridiculing of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Rib, <HI>God's talking with Men, making the World in &s;ix D$ys, and re&s;ting the &s;eventh</HI> his taking the&s;e Things for childi&s;h Notions of <HI>Drury</HI>'s, and more e&s;pecially &s;aying and repeating <HI>they were old Women Stories,</HI> are no other than thi$ Prince's own Words, and were more &s;tr$ngly confirm'd with Additions of the &s;ame Nature, on &s;trictly examining and interroga|ting the Author; who&s;e Character and Circum|&s;tances are al&s;o to be con&s;ider'd, as that he was but <HI>14</HI> Years of Age when he embark'd on this unfortunate Voyage, his being educated at a <HI>Grammer-School,</HI> and in the <HI>Religion of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church;</HI> that ever &s;ince he came home he has firmly adher'd to the &s;ame&punc; even to <HI>Bigotry;</HI> &s;o that it wou'd be a Weakne&s;s to imagine he was able or willing to invent any &s;uch Thing, which might fa|vour <HI>Free thinking,</HI> or <HI>Natural Religion,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Reveal'd;</HI> &s;ince they were Mat|ters he &s;carce ever troubl'd him&s;elf to enquire after. And in all tho&s;e Places where <HI>Religi|on</HI> is touch'd $word$ the <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>Govern|ment,</HI> the Tran&s;criber is only an&s;werable for puting &s;ome Reflections in the Author's Mout$, which as it is the only Artifice here us'd, he makes no Scruple to own, and confe&s;s that he
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
could not pa&s;s &s;uch remarkable and agree|able Topicks without making proper Appli|cations, and taking u&s;eful In&s;tructions from them; yet the Love of the&s;e Subjects has not induc'd the Tran&s;criber to alter any Facts, or add any Fiction of his own; Mr. <HI>Drury</HI> mu&s;t an&s;wer for every Occurrence, the Cha|racter of every Per&s;on, his Conver&s;ation or Bu&s;ine&s;s with them.</P>
<P>There are Authors, who pretend to &s;ay the Religion of the&s;e People is <HI>Mahometani&s;m;</HI> from what they drew this Conclu&s;ion, or where they had their Information is unknown to me; &s;ince their <HI>Sacrifices, Antipathy to Revelation,</HI> and the <HI>Only Place where a</HI> Moori&s;h <HI>Ship, who are</HI> Mahometans <HI>come, Swine's Fle&s;h is eaten;</HI> obviou&s;ly &s;hew there can be nothing in more direct Oppo&s;ition to it: There is no one Circum&s;tance like it ex|cept <HI>Circumci&s;ion,</HI> and that is well known by tho&s;e learn'd in ancient Hi&s;tory, to have been common to &s;ome <HI>Ea&s;tern Nations,</HI> even before the <HI>Jews</HI> had it; and where there is no Rea&s;on to think the Name of the <HI>Jews</HI> was ever heard. (For they were an incon&s;i|derable People, con&s;in'd by their own Laws to them&s;elves, unskill'd in Arts and Sciences, and u&s;ele&s;s to the World.) And of this there is more Proof than what <HI>Herodotus</HI> &s;ays, as well as from the Rea&s;on of the Thing; for there is a Separation of a white Excrement always made behind the <HI>Glans,</HI> and if the <HI>Prepuce</HI> &s;o clo&s;ely covers it that it cannot be
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
expell'd, it corrodes, frets, and cau&s;es dange|rous Inflamations. There is al&s;o a grievous Di&s;order &s;ometimes happens to Children, the Heat of their Water &s;o excoriating the <HI>Prepuce,</HI> that it joyns, and grows together in form of a Bladder, holding the <HI>Urine</HI> that it cannot pa&s;s, till the <HI>Prepuce</HI> is cut; be&s;ides the Injuries to Generation, which oblige People to undergo the Operation at an advanc'd Age; &s;o that the&s;e Inconveni|ences and Pain, which are very often found in hot Countries, have put Men on this Invention to prevent it in their Children.</P>
<P>But I am ready to &s;u&s;pect, we &s;hall have more Rea&s;on pre&s;ently to think, the <HI>Jews</HI> de|riv'd a great deal from them, in&s;tead of they from the <HI>Jews;</HI> that their Religion is more ancient, is evident from &s;everal obvious Rea|&s;ons. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By their regarding Dreams, and divining by them, which, &s;o early as the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> Law, the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were warn'd again&s;t. <HI>2dly,</HI> The&s;e People &s;have their Hair all off in mourning for the Dead: This <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> expre&s;ly commands the <HI>I&s;ralites</HI> not to do. And the <HI>Jews</HI> do &s;till &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly ob&s;erve This, and &s;uffer their Hair to grow in their Mourning. I was going to quote two or three Texts in <HI>Numbers, Deuteronomy, &amp;c.</HI> but on Con&s;ideration find it would be endle&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary; for from almo&s;t the Beginning of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> thro' the Pentateuch and all other the Narrative, as well as preceptive Part of the Old Te&s;tament are full of In&s;tances of this Nature. <HI>3dly, Mo&s;es</HI> commanded none but
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
Males to be &s;acrificed; on the contrary, the&s;e &s;acrifice <HI>Cows</HI> for the mo&s;t Part. The Sacri|fices here are not accompanied with many Ce|remonies which it is plain were added after|wards. On this I&s;land they are only Fea&s;ts with the Addition of a very little Super&s;tition: They have no burnt Offerings; but near their Sepulchres, which with Gums burnt likewi&s;e, may only ari&s;e from a Defence again&s;t cada|verous Scents. <HI>4thly,</HI> But the mo&s;t remarka|ble In&s;tance of all is, that the <HI>Owley,</HI> which the&s;e <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> People u&s;e to divine by, and procure extraordinary Dreams with, is evi|dently the <HI>Ephod</HI> and <HI>Teraphim,</HI> which the <HI>Levite</HI> us'd, who liv'd in <HI>Micah</HI>'s Hou&s;e, &s;ee <HI>Judges 17.</HI> And which the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> could never be wholly brought off from, tho' contra|ry to their Law; for it was again&s;t the Com|mand, that <HI>Abimelech,</HI> the Prie&s;t, con&s;ulted an <HI>Ephod</HI> for <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome have taken the&s;e <HI>Teraphim</HI> for Images like a Man; and there is a &s;hew of Rea&s;on in it from <HI>Mi|chal, S$ul</HI>'s Daughter's putting One in <HI>Da|vid</HI>'s Bed to deceive her Father's Me&s;&s;engers whil&s;t he e&s;cap'd; tho' I am rather inclin'd to think it alludes to &s;ome Divination by the <HI>Teraphim,</HI> which &s;he us'd in his Behalf; for <HI>Teraphim</HI> is the plural Number, therefore could not fignifie only one Image: Neither could the gods which <HI>Rachel</HI> &s;tole from her Father <HI>Laban,</HI> be one god as big as a Man; for &s;he &s;at on them, and hid them. The Word is here in the Original, <HI>Teraphim,</HI> tho' tran|&s;lated
<PB N="x" REF="10">
<HI>gods:</HI> Then in <HI>Ho&s;ea, c. iii. v. 4. an Image,</HI> an <HI>Ephod</HI> and <HI>Teraphim</HI> are all mention'd in one Ver&s;c, plainly &s;hewing, that they are di&s;tinct Things. It is further to be remark'd, that by this <HI>Teraphim</HI> they in|vok'd the Dead, which is exactly the &s;ame as the&s;e People do by the <HI>Owley,</HI> always invok|ing the Spirits of their Fore-fathers, which is expre&s;sly forbid to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and often &s;harply in$eigh'd again&s;t by the Prophets: Tho&s;e, who have any Plea&s;ure in Reading $he Super&s;titions of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Cabbali&s;ts,</HI> may find a great deal of this Kind of Divi|nation by <HI>Ephod</HI> and <HI>Teraphim;</HI> and that the&s;e Spirits are Me&s;&s;engers, who go in the Night to God, and bring back Me&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>This is exactly the very Notion the&s;e Peo|ple have of their <HI>Owleys:</HI> If there &s;hould be any Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e an Image was meant by this <HI>Teraphim,</HI> it would not much alter the Ca&s;e; for after the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and other Nations improv'd in Sculpture, as well as in other Arts, they might come to carving it into an Image; but this <HI>Owley</HI> is plainly the Ori|ginal; we find <HI>Ephod</HI> and <HI>Teraphim</HI> join'd together in &s;everal Places of Scripture; now an <HI>Ephod</HI> is well known to be <HI>a little Linnen Garment,</HI> and this <HI>Owley</HI> being fix'd to a Swa&s;h, finely adorn'd, for a Man to wear, is evidently the &s;ame as <HI>Ephod</HI> and <HI>Teraphim;</HI> and whether the High-Prie&s;t's fine <HI>Ephod,</HI> and <HI>Brea&s;t-plate,</HI> with <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> was not an Improvement from this Original,
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
is no ab&s;urd Que&s;tion, or rather no Que&s;tion at all; for 'tis evident it was for the &s;ame U&s;es; <HI>(viz.)</HI> to <HI>wear,</HI> and <HI>divine by.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may &s;ee the original of the Noti|on of familiar Spirits, which has been &s;till further improv'd by the <HI>Chimeras</HI> of Witch|craft, Sorcery, and the like; all which have no other Foundation, than on the Notion of the Spirits, which the&s;e People &s;ay attend their <HI>Owleys,</HI> as Me&s;&s;engers to God, and ari&s;es from Mens dreaming often naturally, and &s;ometimes, &s;ignificantly (at lea&s;t, mo&s;t are apt to think &s;o;) and this is no more than a Super&s;titious En|deavour to do it profitably for Advice, and Fore-knowledge in Emergencies.</P>
<P>That the&s;e People had not their Religion from any polite, or learn'd Nation, is plain by their retaining no Notion, or Memory of Letters; nor their having a Hor&s;e among&s;t them, or &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a Machine as a Wheel of any kind, either for Carriage, or other U&s;e, which could never have been forgot, had they ever had it. That the&s;e <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> People came fir&s;t from <HI>Africa</HI> is certain, by their Co|lour; and, perhaps, from the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ines,</HI> or even from <HI>Aegypt.</HI> The <HI>Virzimbers,</HI> indeed, by their woolly Heads, mu&s;t come from the more Southern Part of <HI>Africa;</HI> Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Deaan Toak-Offu</HI> told him they had a Tra|dition of their Coming on the I&s;land many Ages ago in large Canoes: But let them come from where they will, it is evident that their Religion is the mo&s;t antient in the known World,
<PB N="xii" REF="12">
and not much remov'd from pure natural Re|ligion; and whether the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and the <HI>Canaanites</HI> had their Religion from them, or that they are <HI>Aegyptians</HI> originally, it had its Ri&s;e long before the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were in Bondage; for <HI>Egypt</HI> was then a very polite Country; and al&s;o to be remembred, that they were not <HI>Idolaters</HI> any more than their Neigh|bours before <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Time. It is worth ob&s;erving, that <HI>Melchizedech</HI> was a King, and call'd the Prie&s;t of the Mo&s;t High God, a Phra&s;e which exactly corre&s;ponds to <HI>Deaan Unghorray,</HI> or the Highe&s;t God; as does al|&s;o this Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Kings, or Lords, who perform them&s;elves all the reli|gious Offices, where the Publick is concern'd.</P>
<P>I can but ju&s;t touch on the&s;e Things, yet the&s;e Hints, tho ha&s;ty, and undige&s;ted, may o|pen a Door to &s;uch a Di&s;covery of the Original of practical Religion as well reveal'd as natural, as is little expected. We have al|ready exceeded the Number of Sheets de&s;ign'd for this Book, and too long delay'd the Publi|cation; &s;o that on no Account, can I at pre|&s;ent examine Authors proper to be con&s;ulted; but am oblig'd, unwillingly to leave this a|greeable Enquiry; yet not without Thoughts of rea&s;&s;uming it: A Gentleman of undoubted In|tegrity, and good Sen&s;e, having given me Hopes of &s;ome curious Remarks he has made in the mo&s;t unknown Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> up in &s;everal Parts of the Country, at a Di&s;tance from the Sea: Where the People have not been
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">
corrupted by <HI>Europeans,</HI> he has found them to be Innocent, Humane, and Moral; as he al&s;o confirm'd the Account our Author has gi|ven of The&s;e.</P>
<P>But as much ha&s;te as I am in, I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over the Ob&s;ervation, That Men in the State of Nature, and con&s;idering God as the Author of the Univer&s;e, form no other Noti|ons of him, but what are con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Ju|&s;tice, Wi&s;dom,</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s:</HI> They &s;ee him to have perfectly fini&s;h'd his Work, and that he wants no Alterations, and Amendments, nor repents of his Actions, as &s;ome would pre|tend, as if he did Things like weak, ra&s;h Mor|tals inadvertently; much le&s;s can they bear to hear of the wor&s;t of Pa&s;&s;ions attributed to the perfect divine Being; &s;uch as Anger, Revenge, and Jealou&s;ie: God has given Men the Sen&s;e of ta&s;ting, to judge what Food is proper for the Support of Life; and as he has form'd them fit for Society, &s;o he has given them Perception, and Rea&s;on to judge what will conduce mo&s;t to their Peace and Happine&s;s in &s;ocial Communities; and we need look no fur|ther for the Original of moral, and politick Laws, than to the mo&s;t &s;imple, and natural Sen&s;ations; (for I &s;hall not call them Ideas) of Plea&s;ure and Pain.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider Mankind in his true natural State, we &s;hall not &s;ee him as the <HI>Hobbi&s;ts</HI> would ridicuou&s;ly in&s;inuate, who imagine only Men of the Male-kind fighting with one ano|ther; on the Contrary, we find Mankind
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">
Male and Female, and the mo&s;t ardent Appe|tites will then plainly appear to be a Fondne&s;s for their Women, and a Tenderne&s;s for their Off-&s;pring, and this is even common to them with &s;ome Brutes; and therefore the <HI>true State of Nature:</HI> From hence ari&s;e benign Di&s;|po&s;itions, Softne&s;s of Temper and Friend&s;hips, the&s;e being more plea&s;ant and &s;afe than Quar|relling, and Fighting; they natural improve and pro&s;ecute them, taking Care not to be di|&s;turb'd in their Enjoyments. In this natural un&s;ophi&s;ticated View of the Human Species, we &s;hall find it to be impo&s;&s;ible for forty Fa|milies to &s;ub&s;i&s;t together, without &s;ome Com|pact, or Agreement to puni&s;h, or expel Adul|terers, Murderers, and Thieves, even for the Space of one Year (I had like to have &s;aid not one Quarter of the Time; but that it would have come too near twice forty Days.) The Re&s;pect due from Children to Parents is taught them early by tho&s;e Parents, and grows up with them; be&s;ides the Gratitude naturally ari&s;ing to tho&s;e, who have fed, and protected them when they were helple&s;s Infants; &s;o that it is no wonder to find a Law here <HI>again&s;t cur&s;ing of Parents.</HI> The Notion of the Be|ing of One &s;upreme Author of Nature, ari&s;es from natural Reflections on the vi&s;ible Har|mony and Uniformity of the Univer&s;e, and &s;eeing Men and Things did not produce them|&s;elves. The Reverence due to this Stupen|dious Being, is only a pious, and rightly turn'd <HI>Amazement, Dread,</HI> and <HI>Re&s;pect;</HI>
<PB N="xv" REF="15">

<HI>MADAGASCAR:</HI> OR, <HI>Robert Drury</HI>'S JOURNAL DURING Fifteen Years Captivity on that ISLAND.</HEAD>
<P>_MY De&s;ign, in the en&s;uing Hi&s;tory, is to give a plain and hone&s;t Narrative of Matters of Fact; I &s;hall not, therefore, make u&s;e of any artful Inventions or bor|row'd Phra&s;es to lengthen or embelli&s;h it; nor &s;hall I offer any other Reflections than what naturally occurr'd from my many uncommon and &s;urpri&s;ing Adventures. And,</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="19">
I hope, it will not be improper to acquaint my Readers, that I was not fourteen Years of Age when the&s;e Mi&s;eries and Misfortunes fir&s;t befel me; &s;o that my Youth as well as Igno|rance of the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Language, render'd me incapable of making tho&s;e many curious Ob&s;er|vations, which One of a riper Age and better Judgment (freed from Slavery) might have done with le&s;s Difficulty, and to much greater Advantage. For,</P>
<P>I, <HI>ROBERT DR&V;RY,</HI> was born on the 24th of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1687. in <HI>Crutched Fryars, London,</HI> where my Father then liv'd; but &s;oon after remov'd to the <HI>Old Jury</HI> near <HI>Cheap-&s;ide,</HI> where he was well known and e&s;|teem'd for keeping that noted Hou&s;e, call'd <HI>The King's Head,</HI> or otherwi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Name of the <HI>Bcef-Stake Hou&s;e;</HI> and to which there was all my Father's Time a great Re&s;ort of Merchants and Gentlemen of the be&s;t Rank and Character.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the Education my Father be&s;tow'd on me, I cou'd not be brought to think of any Art, Science, Trade, Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or Profe&s;&s;ion of any kind what&s;oever, but <HI>Going to Sea:</HI> And as &s;oon as I was capable of an&s;wering any Que&s;tions propounded to me concerning what Bu&s;ine&s;s or Profe&s;&s;ion my Ge|nius led me to, I di&s;cover'd no Inclination to any thing but <HI>the Sea.</HI> And I well remember
<PB N="3" REF="20">
that from Eleven Years of Age, my Mind had taken &s;uch an unhappy Bent this Way, that it grew with my Stature, and at length be|came an ob&s;tinate Re&s;olution; and not all the tender In&s;inuations of my dear and indulgent Mother, tho' &s;he once intreated me on her Knees, nor the Per&s;wa&s;ions of my tender Fa|ther, and other Friends, could make any Im|pre&s;&s;ion on me.</P>
<P>WHEN they found their Endeavours were in vain, they then try'd another Method, and by a &s;eeming Compliance with my De&s;ire, did propo&s;e, and would have procur'd a &s;hort Voy|age for me; hoping that the Dangers I &s;hould be liable to, and the Hard&s;hips I &s;hould &s;ee others &s;uffer, would terrify me from per&s;i&s;t|ing in that Cour&s;e of Life. But,</P>
<P>SUCH was my unhappy Ob&s;tinacy, that no|thing would &s;erve me, but what was for my Ruin; and Providence herein ju&s;tly puni&s;h'd my Di&s;obedience, by granting me the fooli&s;h Choice I had wickedly made, in direct Oppo|&s;ition to my Duty, and the earne&s;t Entrea|ties of my Friends. Thus did this Perver&s;e|ne&s;s of mine bring along with it its own Pains and Puni&s;hment. Nothing but an <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Voyage wou'd &s;erve my Turn; for no other Rea&s;on that I know of, but becau&s;e I had a Cou&s;in at <HI>Bengal,</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>John Steel,</HI> in the New <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company's Service; it being before the Companies were united.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="21">
MY Father &s;hew'd his Care and Tender|ne&s;s for me by his manner of fitting me out, plentifully &s;upplying me with the u&s;ual extra|ordinary Provi&s;ions, and all other Nece&s;&s;aries for the Voyage; be&s;ides the&s;e, I had a Cargo to the Value of an hundred Pounds, which was a very &s;ufficient one for a Boy of my Age. I went as a Pa&s;&s;enger, well recommended to Capt. <HI>William Younge,</HI> my Pa&s;&s;age and Freight of Cargo were agreed for, and we embark'd.</P>
<P>THE Ship which Captain <HI>Younge</HI> commanded in this unfortunate Voyage was the <HI>DEGRAVE,</HI> of 700 Tuns Burden, and mounted 52 Guns. I am not going to give an Account of any of the common Occurrences of the Voyage, or to take Notice of more than two or three extraordi|nary Accidents, and of what only is nece&s;&s;ary to lead to my Purpo&s;e; which is the Hi&s;tory of our Fate on <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> in our Return home|ward, together with my own Mi&s;eries and Va|riety of Fortune during fifteen Years &s;pace in that &s;carce known, tho' large Country.</P>
<P>WE pa&s;s'd through the <HI>Downs</HI> on <HI>Feb.</HI> 19. 1701. when Admiral <HI>Bembo</HI> (who&s;e Son, Mr. <HI>John Bembo,</HI> was fourth Mate of our Ship) lay there with the Squadron of Ships under his Command bound to the <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI> and we ar|riv'd at Fort <HI>St. George</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> in three Months and twenty Days from the <HI>Downs,</HI> having &s;topp'd in our Pa&s;&s;age one Week at the
<PB N="5" REF="22">
<HI>Canaries;</HI> and came to an Anchor there in the Evening.</P>
<P>WE had on board Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lapie,</HI> a Jeweller, and his Son, who went de&s;ignedly to &s;ettle there; and one would have thought, being &s;o near the End of his Voyage, he had great Rea|&s;on to hope, or rather to be a&s;&s;ur'd, he had obtain'd his De&s;ire; the Ship being &s;afe at Anchor in Sight of the Place, and within half a dozen Miles. But &s;ee how Providence di&s;ap|points us, and interrupts our De&s;igns! and what an adver&s;e and mercile&s;s Fate directed, and accompany'd this unhappy Ship, and all concern'd in it!</P>
<P>THE Barge was hoi&s;ted out the next Morn|ing, in order to put the&s;e unfortunate People on Shoar; we rode about two Leagues off. They put off, and we did not expect their Return till the next Day; but about eight a Clock at Night a Voice was heard hailing the Ship; it &s;urpris'd our People, but &s;ome of them &s;oon knew it to be the Voice of <HI>Jo|&s;eph Chamberlain,</HI> who was one of the Barge's Crew: They hoi&s;ted out the Pinnace, and rowing towards the Voice, found him &s;wim|ming on an Oar, who told us, that as &s;oon as they came to the <HI>Bar,</HI> a great <HI>Sea</HI> &s;truck them on the Lar-board Side, and over-&s;et her; he could &s;ee nothing what became of the re&s;t of the Company, and &s;uppos'd they
<PB N="6" REF="23">
were all drowned; for the Current &s;et to Sea|ward, but he, being a good Swimmer, and with the help of one of the Boat's Oars which he happen'd on, made &s;hift to fetch with|in Call of the Ship: We immediately hung a Light on the Top-Ma&s;t Head to guide others, if happily, any had been like him alive and &s;wimming; but no more of them were ever &s;een, or heard of. There peri&s;h'd by this Di&s;|a&s;ter Mr. <HI>John Lapie,</HI> his Son, and their Cook, the Cox&s;wain and nine of the Boat's Crew; they had al&s;o with them very con&s;iderable Effects in Goods, Silver, &amp;c. to &s;ome thou|&s;and Pounds Value.</P>
<P>Two Days after we weigh'd Anchor, and &s;ail'd to <HI>Ma&s;lapatan,</HI> where we &s;taid a Month, and from thence to <HI>Bengall.</HI> My Cou&s;in hear|ing I was arriv'd came on board to &s;ee me, and to take me and my Effects on Shoar with him; but my Father had a more prudent Regard to my Welfare than I could be capa|ble of $t tho&s;e Years; for my Cou&s;in being only a Pilot, my Father had de&s;ir'd Capt <HI>Younge</HI> to inform him&s;elf of his Circum&s;tan|ces, Fortune and Reputation, and if he found him not of &s;ufficient Ability or Hone&s;ty to be entru&s;ted with me and my Effects, that he &s;hould not let me go on Shoar to him.</P>
<P>THE Captain perform'd the Tru&s;t my Fa|ther committed to him very honourably, and
<PB N="7" REF="24">
would not let me go with my Kin&s;man; but took my Cargo, and di&s;pos'd of it him&s;elf, and bought me in Return the Commodities of the Country; and would have brought me back again according to his Contract with my Fa|ther, had Providence permitted him. My Cou|&s;in &s;oon after our Arrival dy'd, and we had a great Mortality among&s;t our Ship's Crew; for during our Stay here which was nine Months, we bury'd above forty of our People: The Chief Mate was the fir&s;t of Note, and about a Month after him Captain <HI>Younge</HI> him&s;elf dy'd of a Fever, happy at lea&s;t in this, that he dy'd in Peace, and liv'd not to bear his Part in the many Mi&s;eries which his Son, and we under|went afterwards; for this Son being &s;econd Mate, and the Chief Mate being already dead, and now the Captain his Father, he became Captain of Cour&s;e; &s;o that there was &s;till a Captain <HI>Younge.</HI></P>
<P>THE only Good which I got at <HI>Bengall,</HI> and which prov'd of any Advantage to me after|wards, was, that I here learnt to &s;wim, which has two or three times &s;ince &s;av'd my Life and Liberty; and I attain'd to be &s;o great a Proficient in &s;wimming by the help of good Companions, that it was a common Practice for half a dozen of us to tye a <HI>Rupee</HI> apiece (which is about the Value of 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> Engli&s;h) in an Handkerchief about our Middles, and
<PB N="8" REF="25">
&s;wim four or five Miles up or down the Ri|ver; and when we came on Shoar, the <HI>Gen|tees</HI> or <HI>Moors</HI> would lend us Cloaths to put on while we &s;taid; thus we us'd to &s;it and regale our&s;elves for a few Hours with Arrack Punch and a Dinner, and then &s;wim back again.</P>
<P>OUR Bu&s;ine&s;s being at length fini&s;h'd at <HI>Ben|gail,</HI> we &s;ail'd from thence, and had at that Time about 120 Hands on board, be&s;ides two Women and my&s;elf, and a few other Pa&s;&s;en|gers; as we were going down the River our Ship ran aground and &s;tuck fa&s;t; but a very &s;trong Tide running, it turn'd her round and the next High-water we got off, and as we then thought without Damage; but when we came to Sea &s;he prov'd &s;o leaky, that we were forc'd to keep two Chain-Pumps conti|nually going: We were two Months in this Condition, at length we fetcht <HI>Mauritius,</HI> which is an I&s;land in the Latitude of 16&frac12; South, and to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> inhabited by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who very civilly treated, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted us with all that was in their Power: We made a Tent on Shoar, in which we &s;tow'd a great Part of our Cargo; for we took out as many of our Goods as we could, to &s;earch for the Leak, but could not find it.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>Boon,</HI> a Pyrate, had been here about two Months before, he having ju&s;t then plunder'd a very rich <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Ship, and had taken
<PB N="9" REF="26">
out of her fifty <HI>La&s;cars.</HI> (For that is the Name which our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen call the&s;e <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> People by.) <HI>Boon</HI> lo&s;t his own Ship on this I&s;land, and the Pyrates were glad to make a &s;mall Sloop of their Long-boat, to get off the I&s;land with; and were therefore forc'd to leave the <HI>La&s;cars</HI> behind them. The&s;e People we took with us, thinking they would be of u&s;e, and &s;ave our Hands from returning &s;o often to the Pump; they having for two Months before but little Re&s;t.</P>
<P>WE found here very good <HI>Fi&s;h, Turtle, Goats,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Beef;</HI> we &s;taid about a Month, and then departed, &s;haping our Cour&s;e directly for the Cape of <HI>Good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>THE Leak gain'd upon us more and more, and we had much adoe to keep her above Water: Our Men were all tired, and &s;pent with continual Labour, pumping and bailing Night and Day, when by our reckoning we were 100 Leagues to the Southward of <HI>Ma|daga&s;car:</HI> We heav'd over-board &s;everal of our Guns and heavy Goods to lighten her. The Captain was for keeping on his Cour&s;e to the Cape, but the Ship's Company were all again&s;t it, being of Opinion, that they could not make her &s;wim long enough, judging them|&s;elves at that time about 600 Leagues from it, and but 100 from <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> which was the neare&s;t Land.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="27">
WITH much Difficulty they at length pre|vail'd with the Captain to put back to <HI>Ma|daga&s;car.</HI> The Wind favouring us, the third Day in the Morning they &s;ent me and the Captain's Boy up to the Ma&s;t-head to look out for Land, &s;ince they cou'd &s;pare no Body el&s;e: In &s;uch Extremity of Life and Death, my being a Pa&s;|&s;enger was not con&s;ider'd, and accordingly I went up, and &s;at there two Hours and an half before I &s;py'd any thing like Land; and when I fir&s;t &s;aw it I told my Companion, but not being &s;ure would not call out; for the Ca&s;e was of &s;uch Con&s;equence, that there was no trifling, nor amu&s;ing them with vain Hopes. However, at length, I plainly di&s;cover'd a white Cliff, and a Smoak at a Di&s;tance from the Cliff; I then cry'd out <HI>La$d, Land.</HI></P>
<P>SEVERAL then ran up the Shrouds, and even the Captain him&s;elf to &s;ee it; One among&s;t them knew the Land, and &s;aid it was <HI>Port Dauphine;</HI> and that the King of that Part of the I&s;land was at Enmity with all white Men, and treated all the <HI>Europeans</HI> he met with very barbarou&s;ly: The Rea&s;on of which, and a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of King <HI>Samuel,</HI> (for that was his Name) I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion here|after to mention. This Information put us into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion and De&s;pair, and was indeed our utter Ruin. The Man who inform'd us was right to the be&s;t of his Know|ledge;
<PB N="11" REF="28">
for they were, indeed, Enemies to the <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and had murder'd all they could find on the I&s;land, in Revenge for an Injury &s;ome of that Country had formerly done to King <HI>Samuel;</HI> but to no other white Men: So that had we put in there, we had at lea&s;t &s;av'd our Lives, and &s;ome of our Cargo; but who can account for the Infatuation of Mankind when de&s;tin'd to their De&s;truction! Our Fate was &s;ix'd, and we were to be de&s;troy'd in the mo&s;t tragical Manner, and all our Endeavours to &s;ave our&s;elves &s;erv'd only to prolong our Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><HI>Port Dauphine</HI> we dur&s;t not put into, for fear of falling immediately into the Hands of re|vengeful and barbarous Murderers, as we then thought them: We could not get to the Northward, the Wind being North-Ea&s;t; nei|ther was there any Harbour or Port to the We&s;t-ward, but what was a Week's &s;ail to it. The We&s;tern Shoar is &s;teep too.</P>
<P>HEREUPON the Captain re&s;olv'd to &s;teer a|long the We&s;tern Coa&s;t, and &s;ee if he could find any Place fit to run her into, or put a&s;hoar with Safety of our Lives. We were at length pretty near the Shoar, but no Place could be found, and her Hold was now half full of Water, the Men went to the Captain, and ask'd him what he de&s;ign'd to do, for &s;he could &s;wim no longer. He went into the Round-hou&s;e for a Minute or two, and when
<PB N="12" REF="29">
he came out he ask'd them, if they de&s;ir'd he &s;hould run the Ship on &s;hore at all Hazards; to which they all a&s;&s;ented, and cry'd out <HI>Any Thing to &s;ave our Lives.</HI> Now here was a Sand which ran along for two Leagues; we came within a quarter of a Mile of the Shoar, and let go an Anchor fir&s;t without the Breakers, and then cut down all our Ma&s;ts and our Rig|ging, threw our Guns and Goods over-board, and try'd all the Means we could, to make her &s;wim till we could get our&s;elves on Shoar. We had lo&s;t our Long-boat and Pinnace at <HI>Bengall,</HI> and had only one &s;mall Boat left, we therefore made a Raft with &s;ome Planks and Yards.</P>
<P>THERE were at that time &s;ome of the Na|tives fi&s;hing, who &s;eeing us in Di&s;tre&s;s, made a Smoak on Shoar to guide and invite us; but we had heard &s;uch a bad Character of the Country, that we could not tell what to ex|pect from them, tho'we were inform'd this was another Prince's Dominions.</P>
<P>WE fini&s;h'd the Raft in the Night, and in the Morning &s;ent Mr. <HI>Prat,</HI> our Chief Mate, and four Men in the Boat with a long Rope for a Warp, to fa&s;ten on the Land. Here a great Sea con&s;tantly runs on the Rocks, and before they got to the Land their Boat was &s;tav'd in Pieces; but, being pretty near, by the help of &s;ome of the Negroes (Natives) they

<P>p. 12</P>

<PB N="13" REF="31">
&s;av'd that part of the Boat to which the Rope was fa&s;ten'd: We had two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Women on board, one of them would not go on the Raft, not would the Captain; but the other Wo|man, and about forty or fifty of us went: I &s;tript my&s;elf of all my Cloaths, but took two Pur&s;es of Money and a &s;ilver Cup, and made them fa&s;t about my Middle; we haul'd by the Rope towards the Shoar, but were no &s;ooner among the Breakers than the fir&s;t Sea turn'd the Raft over, and wa&s;h'd us off; &s;ome &s;wam to the Raft again, but were &s;oon wa&s;h'd off; the Woman was drowned ju&s;t by me, for I could not &s;ave her. I div'd under every Wave, and with great Difficulty got on Shoar, as did every Body el&s;e who were on the Raft, but the Woman. There was &s;uch a Surff run, and the Sea broke &s;o high, that we dur&s;t not venture out to return the Raft; which the Cap|tain ob&s;erving, order'd the Cable to be cut, and let the Ship drive nearer the Land, where &s;he &s;oon beat to pieces: The Captain got on Shoar with his Father's Heart in his Hand, which, according to his Reque&s;t when dying, was put in a Bottle, to be brought to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and bury'd at <HI>Dover.</HI> At length they all got on Shoar on Pieces of the Ship, Planks, &amp;c. except two Men who were drowned, and the Woman I mention'd before: The other Woman e&s;cap'd, tho' &s;he was &s;o full of Wa|ter
<PB N="14" REF="32">
as well as &s;ome Others, that we were forc'd to roll and rub them well to make them di&s;|gorge the Water; we laid them al&s;o before a great Fire made for that purpo&s;e, and in time reviv'd them. We were in all with the <HI>La&s;cars</HI> above one hundred and &s;ixty.</P>
<P>THE Country began now to be alarm'd, and we had already two or three hundred Negroes about us, picking up Pieces of Silk and fine Callico; the Mu&s;&s;in they regarded not. Our Goods were driven a&s;hoar in whole Bails, for what with Salt-petre and other Things, we rec|kon'd there might be then left three hundred Tuns; notwith&s;tanding what we threw over|board at &s;everal times before.</P>
<P>THERE was one Negroe brought an Ox down to us, and made Signs that we &s;hould kill him; we &s;ign'd to them to &s;hoot him for us, for we had &s;av'd no Ammunition; which when one of them ob&s;erv'd, he lent us his Gun ready loaded, with which one of our Men &s;hot the Bullock.</P>
<P>IT was &s;hocking, and even terrible to me, to &s;ee the Negroes cut the Bea&s;t, Skin and Fle&s;h together, and &s;ometimes the Guts too, then to&s;s it into the Fire or A&s;hes, as it hap|pen'd, and eat it half roa&s;ted; I did not know but they would devour us &s;o; for they &s;eem'd to me like what I had heard related of <HI>Canni|bals:</HI> Every Thing before our Eyes appear'd
<PB N="15" REF="33">
horrid and frightful, and excited mo&s;t di&s;mal Thoughts and dreadful Expectations.</P>
<P>IF I here di&s;cover'd a little more Concern than became a Man, I hope my tender Years, little Knowledge and le&s;s Experience will ex|cu&s;e me: This tragical Scene made &s;uch a deep Impre&s;&s;ion on me, that when any Accident brings it to my Mind, I &s;tart, and am &s;hock'd with the frightful Remembrance. If my Ob|&s;ervations are not &s;o many, or &s;o ju&s;t and good as they &s;hould be, they mu&s;t not be look'd on to come from a Man, but a Boy; for as I grew in Years, it will appear, I grew in Know|ledge and Courage, was capable of making more proper Remarks, and al&s;o of enterpri&s;ing more hazardous and dangerous Things.</P>
<P>WHILE the Negroes were bu&s;y opening our Bails, and taking what they lik'd, I ob&s;erv'd &s;ome of them regarded the Iron they found more than all tho&s;e Goods which we call va|luable; and took a great deal of Pains to break any pieces of Timber they met with, which had Iron in them. I broke open my Che&s;t, and took out only one Suit of Cloaths, leaving the re&s;t to whom&s;oever had a Mind to them.</P>
<P>WE remain'd thus two Days and Nights with|out re&s;olving on any one Thing, and not know|ing what to do. We were told <HI>Port Dauphine</HI> was but 60 Miles from us, but the Notion we had of their being a barbarous People prevented our

going thither; but this Debate was &s;oon deter|min'd for us by the Dean (or as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailors call him) King of that Part of the Country.</P>
<P>FOR next Evening about Nine of the Clock, we heard a Man call out <HI>Ho-lo,</HI> at a great Di|&s;tance, like an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> (as he prov'd to be) who being an&s;wer'd came nearer, and ask'd <HI>Who we were.</HI> We told him the Crew of an <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ship, which prov'd &s;o leaky, that we were forc'd to run her in here, as the fir&s;t Land we could make, to &s;ave our Lives. Hereupon he came to us, and being de&s;ir'd &s;at down with us by our Fire, and told the Captain that the King had &s;ent him to tell us, We had no Rea&s;on to fear any Thing tho' we were in a &s;trange Coun|try; and that he would come down him&s;elf the next Day to &s;ee us. The Captain de&s;ir'd him to give us what Account he could of the Coun|try and the Natives; and al&s;o how he came there. We all crowded about him, not &s;o much out of Curio&s;ity to hear a Novelty, as to be able to judge by his Relation, what our Fate was like to be: The Circum&s;tances of his Story were &s;o very remarkable, and &s;o much concern'd us, that I dare &s;ay, I can give it you almo&s;t in his own Words; which were as follow.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="35">
who &s;hould have taken Care of me being dead, I went to Sea very young. My fir&s;t Voyage was to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> but &s;eeing much was not to be got there, I was re|&s;olv'd to try the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> and going thi|ther was taken by a Pirate about an hun|dred Leagues to the Ea&s;t-ward of this I&s;land: They plunder'd the Ship of all her Rig|ging, Ammunition and Liquor; they took me and nine Men more out of her, and then let the Ship go. In the time I was with them they took &s;ome rich Prizes, and I &s;eemingly join'd with them, &s;ince there was no Help to prevent it; we us'd to re&s;ort to this I&s;land for Refre&s;hments. I was &s;oon tir'd of going a pyrating, and be|ing at Anchor in <HI>Mattatan</HI> Road, where the Canoes came off as u&s;ual to &s;ell us <HI>Rice, Plantins, Milk,</HI> and <HI>Honey,</HI> &amp;c. our Boat could not go a&s;hoar, there is &s;uch a great Sea breaks upon the Strand; I took this Opportunity to feign my&s;elf &s;ick, and un|able to &s;tand or walk: and &s;ent &s;uch Word to the Captain (who&s;e Name I mu&s;t not declare being &s;worn to the contrary) de|&s;iring him to let me go on Shoar, hoping the Land Air would refre&s;h me; to which he con&s;ented. I dre&s;s'd my&s;elf, and carry'd as much Gold and other rich Things as I could &s;tow in my Pockets; but acquainted
<PB N="18" REF="36">
no Man with my Intention, becau&s;e not one on Board &s;hew'd any Inclination to leave their dangerous and villainous Engagements, I &s;tepp'd into the Canoe with no little Sa|tisfaction, thinking my&s;elf more happy in this Country, heatheni&s;h and barbarous as it is, than with my former Companions; the Captain &s;ent a Canoe for me, but bad the Men tell him I was not capable of going to Sea any more; and he never &s;ent again.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I had been here about three Months, when Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> in a Merchant Ship, came to trade about the I&s;land; three Days after his Arrival a Pyrate took him as he rode at Anchor: The Pyrates gave Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> his own Long-Boat, and a few Ne|ce&s;&s;aries. There was one Capt. <HI>Steward</HI> with Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> him they permitted to go a&s;hoar al&s;o, and three or four Hands more; it was very calm, and the Sea con&s;equently moderate, &s;o they got &s;afe on Shoar. Here was at the &s;ame time another <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> and his Wife, who came from <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> who were Company for me. When my Compa|nion and I &s;aw the Long-Boat come on Shoar, and the Ship &s;ail away, we gue&s;s'd the Rea|&s;on, and went down to meet them, and to invite them to our Cottages, which were a Mile from the Sea-&s;ide. My Companion,
<PB N="19" REF="37">
by the Help of his Wife, was better provi|ded to entertain them than my&s;elf; we could &s;peak enough of the Language of the Country to deal with the Natives for what we wanted; which was a great Help to tho&s;e who but ju&s;t then arriv'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;CAPTAIN <HI>Drummond</HI> was very melancholy for the Lo&s;s of his Ship, and his being in &s;uch a remote and barbarous Place, and therefore re&s;olv'd to get if po&s;&s;ible to St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> Bay, which is a Place where Ships often come to get fre&s;h Provi&s;ions and Wa|ter: He ask'd us if we would go with him, to which we readily agreed. In a Week's Time we had got Provi&s;ions enough, &s;uch as <HI>Beef, Rice, Water,</HI> and <HI>Firing,</HI> and made the Long-boat tight. We were nine Per|&s;ons in all with my Companion's Wife, and one Negroe.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;WE &s;ail'd three or four Days along the Shoar, and were got to the Southward of <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> when the Wind &s;hifted, and blow'd &s;o hard we could not carry &s;ail; &s;o that in &s;hort, we drove on Shoar within three or four Leagues of this Place where we now are. We &s;av'd all our Lives with our Money, Guns, Powder, Shot, &amp;c. but the Long-Boat was &s;tav'd in pieces. The Natives, who liv'd near the Sea, &s;eeing us in this Di&s;tre&s;s, came down to &s;uccour us, and carried us up to
<PB N="20" REF="38">
their Town; for they found we under&s;tood a little of their Language, and having al&s;o a Negroe with us they were not afraid, tho' they never &s;aw any white Men before; and they were &s;o civil, that we wanted for nothing which they could a&s;&s;i&s;t us with, but they &s;oon &s;ent up into the Coun|try, to let their <HI>Dean,</HI> or King, know of us, who &s;ent his Son and a commanding Officer with fifty Men to fetch us. They were all arm'd with Guns and Lances; we refus'd to go with them, and were as re|&s;olute as we dur&s;t be in oppo&s;ing them; but they &s;oon made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of our Ammunition. Capt. <HI>Drummend</HI> was for de|fending our&s;elves to the la&s;t Extremity, and not deliver our Arms; but it was my Opi|nion, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to get off from them by Force, becau&s;e of their Number; and therefore advis'd Compliance, and &s;ee if we could not obtain our De&s;ires by &s;of|ter Means. We told them we de&s;ir'd to go to <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> (St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> Bay we thought too far to travel by Land) but, in &s;hort, we were not at our own Di&s;po|&s;al, for they oblig'd us to go with them. We made it three Days Travel to the prin|cipal Town where their King's Re&s;idence was. When we came there, and went to &s;ee him, he was drinking <HI>Toake</HI> (which is made
<PB N="21" REF="39">
of Honey and Water like <HI>Mead)</HI> his Sons and Generals were with him; they were all very merry. He ask'd Captain <HI>Drummond</HI> to drink, but the Captain pretended he was &s;ick, and refus'd it. I was the Interpreter between them; the King bad me tell him he &s;hould want for nothing which the Coun|try afforded. The Captain de&s;ir'd I would return for An&s;wer, that he wanted to be in his own Country, and begg'd he would give us Leave to go where we might get Shipping. On this the King look'd &s;ternly, and <HI>&s;aid,</HI> Let the Captain know, if he does not under&s;tand when he is well I do; there are &s;everal Kings on this I&s;land have white Men live among them, and why &s;hall not I, &s;ince our Gods have &s;ent you here? You &s;hall never go as long as I live. As &s;oon as Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> under&s;tood this, his Co|lour ro&s;e, and looking as &s;ternly at the King, <HI>he reply'd,</HI> Let him know, that if I could have &s;u&s;pected this before-hand, he &s;hould never have &s;een my Face alive; I would have &s;ent &s;ome of their black Souls to Hell: It is not their Gods, it's nothing but For|tune and Chance has put me into his Power, and by FORTUNE I may be deliver'd from him. Hereupon he got up without taking his Leave, and went to our Cottage. I &s;tay'd long enough to tell the King what
<PB N="22" REF="40">
he had &s;aid, and without waiting for an An&s;wer, got up and follow'd the Captain. The King &s;eeing Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> go away in a Pa&s;&s;ion, to appea&s;e him &s;ent one of his Generals with an Ox for us to kill, and de|&s;ir'd the Captain to make him&s;elf ea&s;y; we &s;hould be well provided for, if we could eat an Ox every Day we &s;hould have it. The Captain &s;ent my Companion's Wife, who&s;e Name was <HI>Deude,</HI> with a Compli|ment to the King, and to thank him for the Care he took to provide &s;o plentifully for our Support; but withal to tell him, we did not think Life worth pre&s;erving with|out Freedom to enjoy it; and if we could not get home to our Native Country it would be no Favour to let us live.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;WE continu'd thus about a Fortnight before we made any Attempt to e&s;cape; we computed our&s;elves to be about five Days Journey from <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> whither we at length agreed to go, and to &s;teal away by Night, and got what Provi&s;ion we thought proper: Ammunition, or Arms we had none, nor could get any, except that my Companion had two Pocket-Pi&s;tols which the Natives had not di&s;cover'd when they plunder'd us: The Country was woody&punc; and we thought to conceal our&s;elves wel$ enough in the Woods. According to this
<PB N="23" REF="41">
Re&s;olution, on a Moon-light Night, we got out of the Town undi&s;cover'd, and were &s;oon in the Woods. By Day-light they mi&s;s'd us, and the News being carry'd to the King, he immediately order'd us to be &s;ought for, and pur&s;u'd. They &s;oon track'd us, for our Shoes di&s;tingui&s;h'd our Footing from that of the bare-foot Natives; and having got into our Path, they came up with us ju&s;t before Night, and knowing we had nothing to defend our&s;elves, did not offer any Violence to us, but told us we mu&s;t go back with them to their King. Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> told them we would not go back, when they &s;aw our Re&s;olution, and that they could not per&s;uade us with fair Words, they took hold of us. They who &s;eiz'd my Companion not having hold of both his Hands, he had an Opportunity to take out his Pi&s;tol, with which he &s;hot one of them and wounded him: They &s;eem'd enrag'd at this, however they did nothing to us but bind us, till they had made a &s;trict Search, for fear we &s;hould have con|ceal'd more Pi&s;tols; but no more being found than the&s;e of my Companion's, they march'd back with us to their King. When he &s;aw us, he look'd upon us with a frown|ing and threatning Face; and he having but one Eye and thin Jaws, his Countenance,
<PB N="24" REF="42">
when he frown'd, &s;eem'd more terrible. He bad me tell the Captain, and all of them, that if ever we offer'd to run away again he would make us repent it. As to the Man who was wounded, and for the doing of which we had &s;ome Fear, neither he, nor any Body el&s;e &s;aid any Thing about it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THIS was about two Months ago; &s;ince that Time nothing remarkable has happen'd, till Ye&s;terday News came of your being ca&s;t away; and the King immediately order'd me down with the Me&s;&s;age which I have deliver'd to you from him. My Friends are guarded for fear they &s;hould make their E&s;cape, and come to you; as for me, I &s;weeten him, and tell him I will remain with him as long as I live, and he puts &s;ome Con|fidence in me. This, Sir, is a true Account of the Misfortunes and Mi&s;eries we are un|der; and which, I am afraid, will be more now our Numbers are increas'd.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sam</HI> having made an End of his Story, which every Body li&s;ten'd to very attentively, we &s;eparated, and went with heavy Hearts to our re&s;pective Quarters, which were under the Bu&s;hes. It was very late, and we endeavour'd to repo&s;e our&s;elves as well as we could; the Pieces of Mu&s;lin &s;erv'd us to &s;pread on the
<PB N="25" REF="43">
Ground for Beds; but as for my Part, I &s;lept not at all. Now my wicked Ob&s;tinacy appear'd to my View, and my tender Mother's begging me on her Knees not to go to Sea, gave me the mo&s;t di&s;tracting Torture. I could &s;ee my Error now, and repent; but who could I blame but my&s;elf? Here were many poor Men who had no other Way to live, but I had no &s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity; I wilfully run into Mi&s;ery, and I had it. Tears I might, and did &s;hed enough; but could not complain of Fate or Provi|dence, for my Puni&s;hment was ju&s;t, tho' ter|rible.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as Day-light appear'd we were all up, and mo&s;t of my Fellow-&s;ufferers got no more Re&s;t than I; for the Man's Relation had made us give over all Hopes of Re|lief, and nothing but Lamentation, Di&s;tre&s;s, and De&s;pair appear'd in all its di&s;mal various Forms in every Man according to their diffe|rent Con&s;titutions. We could &s;ave neither Arms nor Ammunition, the Want of which fi|ni&s;h'd our De&s;truction; for near one hundred and &s;eventy People would have made their Way thorow that Part of the Country where we wanted to travel, had we wherewithal to have defended our&s;elves; but Fate had or|dain'd it to be as it was, which was in eve|ry re&s;pect in the wor&s;t Manner it could have been. So that we had only our Lives left
<PB N="26" REF="44">
us, for no other U&s;e but to be &s;en&s;ible of Pain, Mi&s;ery, and perpetual Slavery; which was the be&s;t we could then expect.</P>
<P>ABOUT one a Clock in the Afternoon, the King came down with about two hundred Ne|groes. They brought no Fire-Arms with them, for fear we &s;hould &s;natch them; but they were arm'd with Lances. When we &s;aw them coming towards us, we all &s;tood together in a Body, with our Captain at the Head of us, fronting them: When they came near, he call'd <HI>Sam,</HI> which was the Man's Name he &s;ent to us, and ask'd him which was our Captain; being &s;hew'd him, he came to him, took him by the Hand, and &s;aid <HI>Salamonger, Captain;</HI> which is a common Term of Salu|tation, like &s;aying <HI>Your Servant, Sir.</HI> The Captain return'd him the &s;ame An&s;wer; <HI>Sam</HI> having before told him what was proper to &s;ay to the King. He brought with him four large Bullocks, &s;ix Callaba&s;hes of Toak, ten Baskets of Potatoes, and two Pots of Honey; the&s;e he pre&s;ented to our Captain, and gave us al&s;o two or three earthen Pots to boil our Meat and other Victuals in: We immediately roa&s;ted the Potatoes. He &s;tay'd two Hours with us, before he went to the Cottage where he de&s;ign'd to lye that Night, and ask'd &s;everal Que&s;tions about our Ship, and the Manner of her being lo&s;t. He told the Captain he
<PB N="27" REF="45">
was &s;orry for his Misfortunes and Lo&s;s, tho&punc; in my Opinion he was glad of it; for he was, as I found afterwards, more bruti&s;h and di&s;hone&s;t than mo&s;t of the other Kings on the I&s;land; and his whole Nation were cloath'd for many Years out of the Goods they &s;av'd from our Wreck. He &s;aid nothing at this Time to our Captain of carrying us up to his Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>THE next Morning he came to vi&s;it us again, and then he told us we mu&s;t prepare to go along with him to his Town, and there he would plentifully provide for us, and we &s;hould want for nothing the Country afforded. Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> bid the Interpreter tell the King, he return'd him a thou&s;and Thanks for the Ci|vilities he had already receiv'd; and that he was not only unable to make him Satisfac|tion, but very unwilling to put him to the further Trouble and Charge of maintaining &s;o many People. The King reply'd, that if we were as many more he &s;hould not think us a Trouble or Charge; for he &s;hould be &s;ufficiently recompenc'd by the Honour of having &s;o many white Men in his Dominions.</P>
<P>THE Captain by this la&s;t Speech perceiv'd his whole Intention, which &s;o &s;hock'd him, that he could not tell what to &s;ay to him; but after con&s;idering a little, and looking earne&s;tly at <HI>Sam,</HI> he bad him &s;ay, that we
<PB N="28" REF="46">
have Wives, Children, and Relations, who want us and we them; that it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to live here always; and therefore we de&s;ire he will let us go to &s;ome Port where we may meet with Ships, and return to our native Country. The King &s;tood a good while before he an&s;wer'd again; but at length he bid <HI>Sam</HI> tell us, that we &s;hould &s;tay in his Country till &s;ome Ships came there to trade; and then we &s;hould go home. The Captain knowing there was no Port in his Dominions, nor any Harbour for a Ship to put into, took it to be only a Trick and a Compli|ment; for we might &s;tay for ever before a Ship came there to trade. He therefore bad <HI>Sam</HI> tell him he would think of it, and re|turn him an An&s;wer to Morrow; upon this the King departed, and gave us no more Trouble that Day.</P>
<P>AFTER he was gone the Captain call'd us all together, and in a very moving Speech addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to us, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;I am now on an Equality with every Man here pre|&s;ent, my Fortune as low, and my Life no more to be valu'd; I, therefore, do not pre|tend to command, but to con&s;ult with you what is proper to be done in the pre&s;ent Extremity." He further &s;aid, "I am happy in this, that tho' my own Life and Liberty are lo&s;t as well as yours, yet no|thing
<PB N="29" REF="47">
of this Misfortune is owing to me; for I would rather have kept on my Cour&s;e to the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> and tru&s;ted Pro|vidence in a leaky Ship than put in here, but you were all again&s;t it; for in my Opinion, Death is much rather to be pre|fer'd to our pre&s;ent Slavery, and what we are further threaten'd with. In Death our Mi&s;eries will have an End, but now who can tell the Troubles and Torments we &s;hall yet undergo?</Q> <HI>(At this the Tears &s;tood in his Eyes.)</HI> <Q>&startq;I de&s;ire you to con&s;ider, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that we have no Arms nor Ammunition wherewith to defend our&s;elves; and I have endeavour'd to per&s;uade the King to give us a Pa&s;&s;age thorow his Country to a Sea|port, but all in vain; therefore, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> think of it, and con&s;ult your own Safety as well as you can, only agree in one Mind, and I am ready to do any thing you would have me: As for my Life, I &s;et no Value upon it; it is not now worth pre&s;erving, only to try if I can &s;erve you with it. Re|member, I mu&s;t return an An&s;wer to Mor|row Morning, and I will advi&s;e nothing, nor do any thing my&s;elf.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>WE went together and con&s;ulted, as the Captain advis'd, and &s;oon agreed; for there was, indeed, not much Choice to be made: The King had refus'd to give us Leave to go
<PB N="30" REF="48">
to a Sea-port, and we had no Arms to fight and to force our Way, if we could have found it: So we re&s;olv'd to go quietly up the Country with the King; where, perhaps, we &s;hould &s;ee Captain <HI>Drummond</HI> and the other People, who, being gallant and re&s;olute Men, and by this time a little acquainted with the Natives, might be capable of advi&s;ing us.</P>
<P>WITH this Re&s;olution we acquainted the Captain, who was very well contented with it; for, indeed, he did not much Care what became of him&s;elf, &s;ince he had lo&s;t his Ship and Fortune, and de&s;pair'd of ever getting off the I&s;land.</P>
<P>THE next Morning the King came to vi&s;it the Captain, they &s;aluted each other as u&s;ual, and &s;at down together upon the Sand, we &s;tand|ing round them: When they were &s;eated, the King bid <HI>Sam</HI> ask the Captain whether he was ready to travel; for it would be be&s;t to walk in the Cool of the Morning, and re&s;t at Noon. The Captain ob&s;erv'd, that he did not ask whether he had a Mind to go, as might be rea|&s;onably expected, &s;eeing he pretended to give him time to con&s;ider of it; but peremptorily ask'd if he was ready to go. The Captain &s;ee|ing there was no help, and having our Con&s;ent, it &s;ignify'd nothing to di&s;pute it; &s;o he told him we were ready to go when he pleas'd. At this the King &s;eem'd very well &s;atisfy'd, and
<PB N="31" REF="49">
bid <HI>Sam</HI> tell us he would go and break-fa&s;t; and advis'd us to do &s;o too, that we might be the better able to travel.</P>
<P>BUT we had little Satisfaction in eating and drinking, e&s;pecially now the Hour was come, that we mu&s;t leave the Sea-&s;ide; and it gall'd us to the quick, to think how we were forc'd up the Country at the Plea&s;ure of heatheni&s;h Negroes, like a Flock of Sheep, without Power to make Terms for our&s;elves like Men. Some curs'd, and others lamented their hard For|tune, nor were Reflections wanting; for my part, I could not then &s;ee any Rea&s;on to blame any Body; only I have &s;ince thought that our Captain was young, and had not &s;o much Experience as his Father, who, perhaps, would not have put to Sea from <HI>Mauritius</HI> in a leaky Ship, but have took the Company's Cargo out, and left it there till they &s;ent another Ship for it, and &s;av'd all our Lives; however it was as it plea&s;ed Fate!</P>
<P>THE King &s;ent, and the Word was given <HI>To go:</HI> I was always ready, for I would carry nothing with me but what I brought a&s;hoar; but many of our People took Pieces of Silk and fine Callico. We a&s;&s;embl'd together, and went where the King's Tent was. We were no &s;ooner come but he was for marching. We left the Sea with heavy Hearts, looking very
<PB N="32" REF="50">
wi&s;hfully back as long as we could di&s;cern it; and as often as we did, we could &s;ee the Negroes hard at work, breaking up our Bails; and inriching them&s;elves with the Plunder of our Goods; for there was &s;o much to be got, that but few went back with the King.</P>
<P>OUR People were in very indifferent Ca&s;e for travelling; every Body tir'd with working and want of Re&s;t; many lam'd with Hurts receiv'd in getting on Shoar: Some al&s;o with|out Shoes, and mo&s;t with bad Ones; then the Country near the Sea-&s;ide and &s;ome few Miles further is woody, full of &s;hort Under|wood and thorny Shrubs, which tore out Cloaths to Rags; for the Path was very nar|row, and before this Accident but little prac|tis'd; the Ground al&s;o &s;andy: So that when the Sun was advanc'd pretty high, it &s;corch'd our Feet that we were not able to walk.</P>
<P>ABOUT Noon we came to one of their &s;mall mean Villages, con&s;i&s;ting of about eight or ten Hou&s;es, or rather Huts; for they were not above &s;ix or &s;even Feet high, and eight or nine Feet long, and their Doors not above three or four Feet high: Our People crept into the&s;e Hovels to re&s;t, and to &s;ee what they could meet with to refre&s;h them&s;elves&punc; Some found Honey, &s;ome Milk, others Beef; for the King had given us Leave to take what|&s;oever came to Hand of Eatables. The In|habitants
<PB N="33" REF="51">
were all ab&s;ent, the Men down at the Sea-&s;ide making Advantage of our Wreck, and the Women and Children fled into the Woods at our Approach. We pa&s;s'd thorow &s;everal of the&s;e poor Villages, but &s;aw few or none of the People. Here we repos'd our&s;elves till the Heat of the Sun was abated, making a very poor Retaliation on them by $obbing them of Trifles, while they were enriching them&s;elves out of our mo&s;t valuable Commo|dities: However, I ob&s;erv'd &s;ome of our People &s;eem'd a little to gratify their Revenge in it.</P>
<P>IN the Cool of the Afternoon we march'd again, and in a little time came to a more open Country and better Path. The King hav|ing now got us &s;ome Miles from the Sea, le&s;t us, and went before to his Seat, leaving us to march as we could in our own Time, hav|ing before taken Care that we &s;hould not want Provi&s;ions, and left his (Chief Officer, whom tho' of a petty Army, we &s;hall call) General &s;trict Orders to provide what&s;oever we wanted, which the Country would afford.</P>
<P>AT Night we came to another of the&s;e little Villages, where we kill'd a Bullock, and got &s;ome earthen Pots to boil our Meat in; the Water was very dirty, they having none but what they fetch'd a great Way out of Holes and Pits in the Woods, and kept in Calaba&s;hes or long Tubs, which hold four or five Gallons

each; however it &s;erv'd our Turn, for then we were not curious. We repos'd our&s;elves as well as we could on the Ground, and ro&s;e the next Morning by Day-light, <HI>Sam</HI> calling on us to march in the Cool of the Morning. We eat a Breakfa&s;t of Beef without any Bread kind, or Roots in the Room of Bread, and the Meat full of Sand; but at that Time Eating and Drink|ing was the lea&s;t of our Care. We pa&s;s'd this D$y much after the &s;ame manner as the Day before, only with a little more Difficulty to tho&s;e who wanted Shoes, who&s;e Feet were &s;orely prick'd and h$$t in the Woods.</P>
<P>THE third Day of our March we reach'd to our Journey's End: We were forc'd to walk fa&s;ter this Day than either of the former, hav|ing more Ground to travel, and le&s;s Time to do it in; for we were to be at the King's Town before Sun-&s;et. This Day I lo&s;t one of my Pur&s;es, but the Lo&s;s was not of any Importance to me then; for it would have been of little U&s;e had I kept it: Yet in all this great Concern, where my Life and Li|berty were in &s;uch imminent Danger, it was no &s;mall Addition to my Trouble to lo&s;e a Medal, which my Mother had giv'n me at our parting as a Token to remember her.</P>
<P>THE Re&s;idence of this King is about fifty Miles from the Sea-&s;ide; for I &s;uppo&s;e, we might travel &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen Miles a Day.

It &s;tands in a Wood, and is &s;ecur'd in a par|ticular manner with Trees all round it, which &s;eem to have been planted there when very young; they grow very &s;treight and tall, and &s;o near together, that a &s;mall Dog can't pa&s;s between them. They are al&s;o naturally arm'd with large &s;trong Thorns, &s;o that there's no breaking thorow, nor climbing over. There are but two Pa&s;&s;ages, or Gates, no wider than for two to go a-brea&s;t: One of the&s;e to the North|ward, and the other to the Southward; the whole in Compa&s;s is about a Mile.</P>
<P>WHEN we came near we halted, whil&s;t <HI>Sam</HI> went to acquaint the King of our coming, who order'd us to &s;tay till he had made him|&s;elf ready to receive us; our Captain too put us into Form as well as he could, ordering all our Baggage, and Things which our People brought with them, to be laid down under a <HI>Tamarind</HI> Tree, and three or four <HI>La&s;cars</HI> to look after it. He &s;oon &s;ent for us, and we march'd in Order by Fours. The King was &s;itting on a Mat cro&s;s-legg'd in the open Air, ju&s;t before the Door of his Hou&s;e, having a Gun leaning on his Shoulder, and a Brace of Pi&s;tols lying by him; his Sons and Kin&s;men in the &s;ame manner &s;itting on the Ground on each Hand with Guns and Lances; his People joining them on both Sides, forming together an Half-moon; they too were mo&s;t of them
<PB N="36" REF="54">
arm'd with Guns and Lances. There were Mats &s;pread from one End of the People to the other for us to &s;it on, &s;o that when we had join'd them, the whole A&s;&s;embly made almo&s;t a Circle. We were a little concern'd to &s;ee them all arm'd, till <HI>Sam</HI> told us, it was their Cu&s;tom never to go from one Hou&s;e to another without their Guns and Lances.</P>
<P>AFTER we were &s;eated, the King (by <HI>Sam)</HI> bid the Captain <HI>Welcome,</HI> and &s;ent for ten Ca|laba&s;hes of <HI>Toake;</HI> &s;ix he gave to our People, three to his own, and one he kept betwixt our Captain and him&s;elf. He al&s;o &s;ent for Cap|tain <HI>Drummond,</HI> Captain <HI>Steward,</HI> and the re&s;t of their Company. Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> aro&s;e to &s;a|lute them, and the common Civilities being over, the Captains &s;at by each other. The King order'd a Servant to pour out &s;ome <HI>Toake</HI> into a clean earthen Cup, which he had for him&s;elf, and drank it up without any Form of Compliment by drinking to any Body; but order'd &s;ome to be pour'd out for our Cap|tain in another Cup that was dirty, which our Captain refus'd. The King ask'd the Rea|&s;on of it, and was told by <HI>Sam,</HI> that it was becau&s;e it was dirty; &s;o the King &s;ent a Man to wa&s;h it. The Captain ask'd for the King's Cup, but <HI>Sam</HI> inform'd him that neither <HI>Black</HI> nor <HI>White</HI> ever drank out of his Cup, not even his Wives or Children; and this is the gene|ral
<PB N="37" REF="55">
Cu&s;tom of the Country. When I &s;aw the Servant returning with the Cup wa&s;h'd, which our Captain had refus'd, I took out my &s;il|ver Cup, and pre&s;ented it to him; after we had all drank out of it, the King de&s;ir'd to &s;ee it, and was &s;o wonderfully delighted with it, that he begg'd it. But the Captain told him it was none of his own, it belong'd to a Boy that was behind him. I call'd to <HI>Sam,</HI> and de&s;ir'd him to tell the King, <Q>that &startq;&endq;&s;eeing &s;o many People had drank out of it, I did conceive,</Q> it could not be proper for his U&s;e. At this he, and his People too, laugh'd hear|tily. He de&s;ir'd me to &s;tand up that he might &s;ee me; however I kept my Cup this Time. Night drawing on he took his Leave, order|ing us a Bullock for our Supper. He would not tru&s;t us all to lye in the Town, there were but few of us lay within the Gates, be&s;ides our Captain, Mr. <HI>Prat,</HI> our chief Mate, Mr. <HI>Bembo,</HI> our &s;econd Mate, and my&s;elf. We had a Hutch order'd us next to Capt. <HI>Drum|mond</HI> and his Companions, but the re&s;t of the People lay without the Gate under the Trees.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner we liv'd for a few Days: I know not what particular Amu&s;ements &s;ome of our People found to pa&s;s away their melan|choly Hours; but there occurr'd to me an Affair of a mo&s;t agreeable and &s;urpri&s;ing Na|ture; and which many would have made a
<PB N="38" REF="56">
much better U&s;e than I did. <Q>&startq;&endq;This King had a Daughter, a Girl, as One might gue&s;s, about thirteen or fourteen Years of Age, and &s;he us'd to talk often to me a great While together, tho' I did not under&s;tand a Word &s;he &s;aid. She &s;eem'd to be very de&s;irous I &s;hould apprehend her Meaning, but &s;he was mode&s;t, and us'd no unhand&s;om Ge|&s;tures to explain any loo&s;e Inclinations, and no &s;uch Thing came into my Head; &s;o that our Conver&s;ation on my &s;ide tended to nothing: Which &s;he at length perceiv|ing, &s;ent <HI>Sam</HI> to me one Day, to de&s;ire I would come to her Nur&s;e's Hou&s;e, where &s;he was brought up, and eat &s;omething with her. I went along with him, and when we came there, I found a Mat &s;pread on one &s;ide of the Hou&s;e, on which &s;he de|&s;ir'd us to &s;it; and order'd one of her Slaves to boil &s;ome <HI>Guinca</HI> Corn and Milk, and roa&s;t &s;ome Beef. She &s;ate down over a|gain&s;t me, and tho' I had no Notion of LOVE, yet I could not help ob&s;erving a particular Softne&s;s in her &s;peaking to me; and when &s;he ask'd <HI>Sam</HI> of our Misfortunes, &s;he &s;hew'd a great deal of Concern and Pity, and look'd at me with &s;ome uncommon Plea|&s;ure, as People do at Pictures which plea&s;e them, and &s;tar'd me almo&s;t out of Counte|nance. I thought &s;he was re&s;olv'd to know
<PB N="39" REF="57">
me again, &s;he remark'd me &s;o all over. She was wondrous courteous and obliging, and often &s;igh'd with Pity at the Sen&s;e &s;he &s;eem'd to have of our mi&s;erable Condition. I look'd upon her to be a good-natur'd Crea|ture, and that Curio&s;ity more than Love had made her de&s;irous of being acquainted with a <HI>White Man,</HI> which is &s;o &s;trange a Sight in their Country. We were ju&s;t en|tring into the be&s;t Part of the Conver&s;ation, and our Interpreter had began at her Reque&s;t, to tell me the Rea&s;on of her extraordinary Courte&s;y and Ob&s;ervation of me, when her Mother came to the Door, and ask'd her to take a Walk without the Gates to &s;ee the white Men. I was concern'd at this Interruption, and &s;he &s;eem'd much more vex'd at it her&s;elf; but it would have been imprudent to have refus'd her Mother's Re|que&s;t; &s;o &s;he went with her Mother, and we return'd. <HI>Sam</HI> told me &s;he had order'd him to acquaint me that &s;he was in Love with me; but charg'd him to &s;ay nothing of it to any other Man, either white or black. I was &s;trangely &s;urpris'd at this plain Declaration, and that this was the End of her coveting &s;o much of my Com|pany. Since I came to be a Man, I have wonder'd at the Thoughts of my own Stu|pidity, &s;o as to put a young Lady to the
<PB N="40" REF="58">
Expence of acquainting me with her Love, and expo&s;ing her&s;elf to another Man. I have nothing to offer in Excu&s;e, but that being a Youth not &s;ixteen Years of Age, the Di&s;co|very of &s;o great a Secret created in me more Fear than Love, le&s;t the Con&s;equen|ces of this Affair might prove fatal to me. The &s;ame Night &s;he &s;ent again for me, and I went accordingly, and there behav'd my|&s;elf with all the Deceney and good Man|ners, as Policy and Gratitude for her Ci|vilities oblig'd me to. I knew &s;he was the King's Favourite, and that he dearly lov'd her, I was, therefore, more fearful of di&s;|obliging her, le&s;t &s;he might tell her Fa|ther what Story &s;he pleas'd, and de&s;troy me. At length I found &s;he was afraid of her Father's knowing it; &s;o that I look'd on my&s;elf to be in Danger on both Sides, and for this Rea&s;on, when <HI>Sam</HI> told me &s;he de&s;ir'd my Company again the next Night, I pretended my&s;elf to be very &s;ick, and unable to go; &s;o that this Affair which might have afforded much Plea&s;ure to &s;ome others, prov'd to me, in my then Circum|&s;tances, a Matter of Vexation and Trou|ble; but two Days after an End was put to our Amour,</Q> if I may call it &s;o.</P>
<P>EVERY Morning we us'd to go in a Body, and vi&s;it the King; till one Morning he bid
<PB N="41" REF="59">
<HI>Sam</HI> tell us, that he had a very potent Ene|my to the We&s;tward, who had hitherto been too powerful for him; but &s;ince his Gods had &s;ent him &s;ome white Men, he would take this Opportunity once more to try his Strength with our A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but in the mean time he mu&s;t di&s;tribute us among his Sons, who liv'd at other Towns, as well for more convenient Provi&s;ions for &s;uch a Number of us (there not being Room enough in this Town) as to ea&s;e him&s;elf of a Charge too great and trouble|&s;ome for him alone to &s;u&s;tain. He al&s;o &s;ent to me this Night to beg the Cup, which I did not refu&s;e him, knowing it was in his Power to take it by Force. This Parting was a terrible Blow to us, and we return'd to our Cottages with heavy Hearts, knowing if we could not find &s;ome Way to prevent our Se|paration, there remain'd for us no Hopes of ever getting off the I&s;land.</P>
<P>HEREUPON the three Captains, <HI>viz. Drum|mond, Sieward,</HI> and <HI>Younge</HI> enter'd immediately into a Con&s;ultation with a few only of the chief of our People, to con&s;ult what was proper to be done on this emergent Occa&s;ion, and to make &s;ome Attempt for our precious Liberty. It was Captain <HI>Drummond,</HI> as I heard afterwards, who propos'd to take the King Pri&s;oner; and by that Means to make their own Terms with the People. Now Captain
<PB N="42" REF="60">
<HI>Drummond</HI> and &s;ome others were experienc'd Men, and of gallant enterpri&s;ing Spirits; our Captain had Courage enough, but he was too young. However every Body approv'd the Propo&s;ition, and the Time and Manner of the Execution was fix'd. I was too young to be of the Council, &s;o I will not pretend to re|late what Rea&s;ons were giv'n for and again&s;t the Propo&s;al, tho' I was told afterwards. But that Night I was wholly ignorant, I ob&s;erv'd Cap|tain <HI>Younge</HI> and Mr. <HI>B$mbo</HI> to talk with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, but &s;oftly, and with Caution: However, I &s;lept &s;ound, till I was wak'd in the Morning by a great and &s;udden Noi&s;e in the Town, occa&s;ion'd by the putting their Plot in Execution. Our People went as u&s;ual, early in the Morning to vi&s;it the King (by what Mi&s;take it came to pa&s;s that I was not call'd I know not) when &s;ome of them were got to the Prince's Hou&s;e, the Signal was giv'n by one of Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI>'s Mens firing a Pi|&s;tol; at which the King was &s;eis'd, and his Son at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>THIS immediately alarm'd the whole Town: I &s;tarted up, and jump'd out as I lay, with|out Shoes, being frighted at the &s;udden Cry and Uproar: Not knowing what was the Matter, and &s;eeing the Negroes running out of the Town, I ran with them, till I was e&s;py'd by one of our Men, who call'd me back; and
<PB N="43" REF="61">
I was as much amas'd as the Natives, to &s;ee the King, his Wife, and one of his Sons, with their Hands ty'd behind them, and guarded by our People. They &s;oon plunder'd the King's Hou&s;e, and every other Place, where they could find any Thing fit for their Pur|po&s;e. We happen'd to find about thirty &s;mall Arms, &s;ome Powder and Shot, and &s;ome got Lances. The People (as I before ob&s;erv'd) ran out of this Town, but they did it only to gather more Strength; for they &s;oon a|larm'd the Country, and return'd with great Numbers from all the Neighbouring Towns, and be&s;ieg'd us. They fir'd in upon us, and wounded one of our Men in the Groin, on which Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> bid <HI>Sam</HI> tell the King if they fir'd any more, they would immediately kill him. When the King heard their Re&s;o|lution, he call'd to his Men, and de&s;ir'd them to forbear firing, if they had a Mind to &s;ave his Life.</P>
<P>THIS Attempt, indeed, was bold and ha|zardous, and &s;ome, perhaps may think it cri|minal; howbeit I &s;hall &s;ay but little in its Defence: Yet &s;ince I have arriv'd to Years of Maturity, I cannot but reflect, that if <HI>Nature,</HI> ev'n in a Chri&s;tian Country, <HI>will rebel again&s;t Principle,</HI> what will <HI>It</HI> not do for Life and Li|berty under Heatheni&s;m!</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="62">
HOWEVER, at length we put our&s;elves in Or|der, and march'd out of the Town: Six Men arm'd march'd in the Front, and in the Body where the King was, &s;ix went arm'd before him, and &s;ix behind; three before his Son, and three behind him; and &s;ix brought up the Rear, in which were the <HI>La&s;cars.</HI> Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> out of Pity releas'd the Queen, and let her go whither &s;he pleas'd; but &s;he would not leave her Husband.</P>
<P>BY that Time we had got about four Miles on our March, the wounded Man fainted; and we could not &s;tay to make Provi&s;ion to carry him, but were forc'd to leave him by the Side of a Pond of Water; where, as I was afterwards inform'd, they &s;oon put him out of his Pain, by &s;ticking their Lances in almo&s;t every Part of his Body. About two or three Miles further we got out of the Woods, and found our&s;elves in a large open Plain where we could &s;ee all around us, and &s;oon found that our Enemies were near and numerous, threatning immediately to attack us. We fac'd toward them, our arm'd Men in the Front, and the King bound before them. <HI>Sam</HI> was order'd to tell him, that they did not de&s;ign to hurt either him or his Son, nor to carry them to their Enemies Country; that our De&s;ign was only to detain them as Pledges for our Safe-guard, while we pa&s;s'd
<PB N="45" REF="63">
thorow his Dominions; and as &s;oon as we came to the Borders of <HI>Port-Dauphine</HI> Coun|try we would let them go again, and give them back the Arms and Ammunition we took from them; but if any Violence was offer'd to us we would &s;acrifice them, and this we de&s;ir'd him to tell his People.</P>
<P>UPON which he call'd one of his Generals, and bid him not be afraid to come to him, for he &s;hould receive no Harm. Accordingly he left his Gun and Lance behind him, and came to us, where he was a&s;&s;ur'd by us and the King of our Intention; hereupon he told us there &s;hould not be a Gun fir'd at us while we kept the King alive, and us'd him well.</P>
<P>WHEN this Parley was over, we continu'd our March thorow the Plain till near Eve|ning, many without Shoes as well as my&s;elf, and &s;ome &s;ick; which oblig'd us to take up our Quarters &s;ooner than we would have done; &s;o that every Body was faint, and glad to re&s;t them&s;elves. The King bid <HI>Sam</HI> to tell us, that he had order'd an Ox to be brought to us By-and-by. We made a round Trench, like a Ring, in the Mid&s;t of which we plac'd the black King and his Son; our Captain and &s;ome few others were appointed to guard them: Our armed Men were divided into four Parties as might be&s;t &s;ecure us. We had ju&s;t fini&s;h'd our Camp, when the Officer who
<PB N="46" REF="64">
had been with us came, and three Men with him bringing a Bullock. He brought &s;ome roa&s;ted Meat in his Hand, and an Horn of Water for the King; &s;o we loos'd his and his Son's Hands that they might feed them|&s;elves. They eat a little, and gave the re&s;t to Capt. <HI>Younge.</HI></P>
<P>IN the mean Time we were bu&s;y in killing the Ox, we de&s;ir'd the King to &s;end &s;ome of his People into the Woods for &s;ome Fuel; which he readily did, and they &s;oon brought us a &s;ufficient Quantity. But all this While we had no Water, which we as much wanted as Meat, and complain'd to the King, who told us there was none to be got near that Place by &s;ome Miles; that which was given him in the Horn being brought from that Pond where we left the wounded Man; which we gue&s;s'd might be about ten Miles Di&s;tance. This very much di&s;hearten'd us, for we were parch'd up with Thir&s;t, the more encreas'd by the Fatigue of our long March, and the Heat of the Country. However there was no Help for us, and bear it we mu&s;t. When the King and his Son had &s;upp'd we bound their Hands before them, that they might &s;leep as ea&s;y as they could; &s;o we, after having cut up our Bullock, and divided it among&s;t us, broil'd and eat it, tho' with little Satisfaction for Want of Water; and when we had made as good
<PB N="47" REF="65">
a Supper as our mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances would admit of, we al&s;o endeavour'd to repo&s;e our|&s;elves. The three Captains agreed to watch by Turns, and divided our People into three Parties for that Purpo&s;e. The King de&s;ir'd his Wife to go Home and comfort his Chil|dren, particularly recommending to her Care his beloved Daughter. She went at his Re|que&s;t, but wept at parting, as did al&s;o the King and his Son. We who were not on the Watch lay down, and a wretched Night we had, for it was a &s;tony Ground and little Gra&s;s; but our Thir&s;t increa&s;ing was the mo&s;t intol|lerable Mi&s;ery of all.</P>
<P>BY Day-light we aro&s;e, which was the &s;e|cond Day of our Travel, and the better to &s;trengthen our&s;elves for our Journey, we eat &s;ome of the Remains of our Beef; but it was a mi&s;erable Repa&s;t without Drink. However we put our&s;elves in Order as the Day before and went forwards; the Natives, who all this While ob&s;erv'd our Motions, &s;eeing us moving they mov'd too, but kept at a greater Di|&s;tance, and went into our Camp after we had left it to &s;ee what they could find, and they did not wholly lo&s;e their Labour; for many of our People were glad to leave half tho&s;e <HI>In|dia</HI> Goods they brought out of the Town be|hind them, that they might travel the bet|ter. We walk'd with more Ea&s;e half this
<PB N="48" REF="66">
Day than the Day before, it proving cloudy Weather and cool. About Noon the Gene|ral, who was with us before, came with &s;ome roa&s;t Meat, and an Horn of Water for the King and his Son, and fed them; for we did not loo&s;e their Hands. The General bid <HI>Sam</HI> ask the Captains, if they would relea&s;e the King for &s;ix Guns. I perceiv'd there was a Debate between them and Mr. <HI>Bembo</HI> what to do. Some thinking the &s;ix Guns would be of great U&s;e to us, e&s;pecially &s;eeing we &s;hould &s;till have the King's Son. Others were of Opinion, that it would be &s;afer for us to keep the King; but it was at la&s;t agreed to part with him. We told the General, if they would give us &s;ix very good Guns, and pro|mi&s;e not to follow us, but return back with their King, we would let him go; and that as &s;oon as we came to the River <HI>Manderra,</HI> which parted his Dominions from tho&s;e of <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> we would relea&s;e the King's Son, and leave with him all their Arms be|hind us.</P>
<P>THE General was &s;urpris'd at this unex|pected Conde&s;cention of our People, and di|&s;patch'd away one of his Men to the King's other Sons, who were not far off with their Army, to acquaint them of it; they &s;oon &s;ent the &s;ix Guns, for in half an Hour's Time they return'd to us with them. They made the
<PB N="49" REF="67">
more Ha&s;te fearing our Minds &s;hould change: We detain'd them no longer in &s;u&s;pence than while we took the Guns to pieces, to &s;ee whether they were good; and finding them better than we could have expected in &s;uch a Country, we releas'd their King, and &s;ent him away with the General. He took his Leave of the Prince, and went to his Army. We were &s;o very near as to &s;ee the Ceremony of his Sons meeting him at that time, who fell down and embrac'd his Knees with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;hedding Tears for Joy: After they had ki&s;s'd, and lick'd his Knees and Legs for five or &s;ix Minutes, they aro&s;e to give his Head Officers an Opportunity of do|ing the &s;ame, and after them many others; all whom expre&s;s'd a mo&s;t &s;incere and pa&s;&s;io|nate Affection to him in this Manner, and &s;how'd exce&s;&s;ive Joy at receiving him again; they then fell to &s;houting, hallowing, and fi|ring their Guns to declare their great Satis|faction.</P>
<P>WE could not help &s;topping to &s;ee this Scene, which being a little over, we march'd forward, tho' after a poor Manner; for tho' it continu'd cloudy, yet the Afternoon was &s;ultry hot, and our Thir&s;t increa&s;ing, our People began to be &s;en&s;ibly weaker and weak|er; but the Captains walk'd &s;lowly on, which made our travelling &s;omething ea&s;ier. We
<PB N="50" REF="68">
as'd the Prince if there was no Water near, who told us, there was none to be got till we came to <HI>Manderra</HI> River, which we could not reach that Night. We made him our Guide, tho' it was not ea&s;y for us to mi&s;s the Way; for we had inform'd our&s;elves from the Natives, that the Plain we were in was long, and of no great Breadth in Proportion to the Length, but extended it&s;elf near <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> to the River. When we came to a &s;andy Place, it being pretty near Sun-&s;et, we halted and form'd our Camp, which was &s;omewhat &s;ofter to lye on than our former Night's. The Natives &s;eeing us begin to in|camp, they al&s;o form'd theirs. They divided them&s;elves into &s;ix Parties, and &s;o order'd the Matter that they very near &s;urrounded us; which did not a little daunt us. However, we appointed the Watch as before, but to our Misfortune here were neither Meat nor Wa|ter, and we almo&s;t parch'd to Death; and to &s;o great an Extremity were we reduc'd, that we crawl'd on the Ground to lick the Dew; and this was all the Means we had to moi&s;ten our Lips.</P>
<P>THE next Day, which was the third of our March, we ro&s;e early, and &s;oon put forward as well as we could; the Negroes, &s;trictly ob|&s;erving our Motions, were as ready as we; but we plac'd our armed Men in the Front,

re&s;olving to make a Pu&s;h for it if they at|tempted to hinder us. They divided, and let us pa&s;s without Mole&s;tation, and we travell'd all the Morning without any Thing remar|kable, till we got to a little round Hill, on which there &s;tood a prodigious large Tub, &s;ix Foot high, and held as near as might be gue&s;s'd about an hundred Gallons; this was full of <HI>Toake,</HI> and our People were going to drink it, when <HI>Sam</HI> came and pu&s;h'd it over, and &s;pilt all the Liquor; asking us if we were mad, that we could not &s;ee this was de&s;ign'd as a Plot for our De&s;truction: For it was &s;et in this droughty Place to tempt us to drink, with De&s;ign either to poi&s;on us im|mediately, or &s;o to intoxicate us, that they might re&s;cue their Prince, and murder us at their Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>WHILE we were wondring at this, the Ge|neral, and two or three more came towards us, and ask'd <HI>Sam</HI> why he &s;pilt the <HI>Toake?</HI> To which he gave him no An&s;wer, but bid him be gone about his Bu&s;ine&s;s. The Gene|ral de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with the Prince, and af|ter a little Talk with him, order'd <HI>Sam</HI> to acquaint Capt. <HI>Younge,</HI> that if he would re|lea&s;e the Prince, they would give him three of the Head-men of the Country in his Room. The Captain told him, if he would be one him&s;elf they would agree to it. He excus'd
<PB N="52" REF="70">
him&s;elf becau&s;e of his Family, which, he pre|tended, would be di&s;tracted for him; but he promis'd, that his own Brother, who had none, &s;hould be &s;ent as one of the Ho&s;tages.</P>
<P>CAPT. <HI>Younge,</HI> who thought they follow'd us for nothing but their Prince; and that if we releas'd him, they would go back and leave us, told the General he was content it &s;hould be &s;o. Hereupon he ha&s;ted immediate|ly to the Army, and acquainted the other Princes with it; for the King went &s;treight home as &s;oon as he departed from us. We march d on, re&s;olving to lo&s;e no Time, and about an Hour after the General return'd with three Men; and told us, he had brought his Brother, and two more of the Chief of their People to exchange for the Prince; and as to the Arms we had which belong'd to their King, we might, when we had done with them, leave them according to our Promi&s;e with the&s;e three Men, who would take Care to have them fetch'd home.</P>
<P>WE took the three Men, and ty'd their Hands behind them; and then deliver'd the Prince to him. He &s;hook Hands with our Cap|tains, and went to the Army: His Brethren &s;eeing him coming ran to meet him, as did al&s;o many others; and there &s;eem'd to be more Rejoicing for his Deliverance than there was before for the King's.</P>

WE proceeded on our Journey as well as our feeble Limbs would carry us, without Meat and Drink, and &s;oon &s;aw Capt. <HI>Younge</HI>'s Mi&s;take; for the Negroes, in&s;tead of going back, came nearer to us, and &s;ome march'd before us; &s;o that we expected every Mi|nute when they would a&s;&s;ault us. We had a young Lad who lo&s;t his Leg at <HI>Bengal,</HI> but had a wooden One, tho' well fitted, yet was he not able to keep up with us; for we, be|ing now &s;urpris'd by their &s;urrounding us, ha&s;ten'd on more than before; in&s;omuch that we were forc'd to leave this poor Lad be|hind us. We &s;aw them as they came up with him take off his wooden Leg, and make Sport with it, bidding him follow us; till at length they thru&s;t their Lances into his Body, and left him wallowing in his Blood. We now &s;aw plainly what we had to expect from them, and therefore hurry'd on as fa&s;t as our feeble Limbs could carry us till Sun-&s;et; when we came to a large <HI>Tamarind</HI> Tree, which we climb'd for the Leaves to chew, becau&s;e they were &s;our; it not being then the Fruit-&s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE three black Men we had Pri&s;oners &s;ee|ing what had pa&s;s'd, began to be afraid of their Lives; for they thought if their People attack'd us they were &s;ure to be kill'd; they therefore call'd <HI>Sam</HI> and the Captains, and
<PB N="54" REF="72">
told them they had a Propo&s;al to make, which would be for the Safety of all our Lives: It was, <Q>&startq;That as &s;oon as it was dark, we &s;hould &s;ilently march from this Place, and walk all Night.&endq;</Q> The Captains lik'd the Propo|&s;al, and order'd us not to &s;leep, but to be ready as &s;oon as the Word was giv'n to go forward, This was very hard, con&s;idering how tir'd we were the Day before; but we were glad to &s;ubmit to any Thing that gave us Hopes of e&s;caping from tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians.</HI> As &s;oon as it was dark enough to conceal our Flight, we a&s;&s;embl'd together, and took &s;ome Mu&s;lin and Call$co and hung them upon the Bu&s;hes, that the Spies, who, we knew, watch'd us, might think we &s;till remain'd there.</P>
<P>WE walk'd off very &s;ilently and &s;lowly, and undi&s;cover'd by them. Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> was taken &s;o ill he could not walk, and there were none of us able to carry him; at la&s;t we re|&s;olv'd to make the three <HI>Blacks</HI> carry him by Turns. When we had thus travell'd mo&s;t part of the Night, we came to a Thicket among &s;ome <HI>Cotton</HI> Trees, where the Man who carry'd Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> pretending to heave him&s;elf up to give a Lift, threw the Captain on the Ground, and ran away into the Wood, and we never &s;aw him again. We took more Care of the other two, and led him, who&s;e Turn it was to carry the Captain, with a Rope about his Neck.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="73">
WE travell'd a great many Miles this Night, notwith&s;tanding our weak Condition, and were glad when we &s;aw the Day break; for the Ne|groes had told us if we travell'd all Night, be|fore half the next Morning was pa&s;t we &s;hould be at <HI>Manderra</HI> River: And their Informa|tion was true, for as we went on and came to a little Hill, the Sun ju&s;t ri&s;ing, they &s;hew'd us the River. It was a great way off, yet the Hopes we had of coming to it in a little time, and of getting Water to quench our parched Bodies, gave us no &s;mall Plea&s;ure, and our Spirits began to revive even at the Sight of it. That this was al&s;o the Bounds of this King's Dominion gave us &s;ome Comfort, tho' there were no Inhabitants to protect us with|in &s;everal Miles on the other Side. Some of our People who were tir'd began to take the Liberty of &s;itting down; thinking the Ne|groe Army would never come in Sight of us again.</P>
<P>BUT this flattering Pro&s;pect of Safety quick|ly vani&s;h'd, for as &s;oon as they mi&s;s'd us in the Morning, they ran after us like &s;o many Grey-hounds; and by that time we got with|in a Mile of <HI>Manderra</HI> River they overtook us, and began immediately to &s;laughter our Men then re&s;ting under the Trees, &s;triking $heir Lances into their Sides and Throats. I was one of tho&s;e who could not travel well,
<PB N="56" REF="74">
but there were twenty behind me; the Wo|man who was &s;av'd in our Ship was next to me. I, &s;eeing them kill our People as they overtook them, tore off my Coat, and after|wards my Wa&s;tcoat, throwing them away, that they &s;hould not hinder me in running; for the foremo&s;t of our People being got over the River, and I not far off, took Courage; but as I look'd back at the Pop of a Gun, I &s;aw the Woman fall, and the Negroes &s;ticking their Lances in her Sides. It was my Turn next, for the &s;ame Negroes came after me, and I was ju&s;t got to the River-&s;ide as they fir'd a Gun at me; but I jump'd into it. Our Men who had got over made a Stand on the other Side to defend us who were behind; and for all the Negroes follow'd me clo&s;e, I would not go thorow the River, without &s;top|ping to drink two or three Times out of my Hat, till I was &s;well'd with Water.</P>
<P>I got over to our People, and whil&s;t we were on the Bank, and fac'd them, they would not attempt to go over. Our Captains ask'd me if there were any more of our People to be expected, I told him no; they were all kill'd. We waited, however, a little, and &s;ee|ing no Hopes of any e&s;caping to us we march'd on. We had a Wood to go thorow, and the Negroes follow'd us as &s;oon as they &s;aw us gone from the Banks. They got into the
<PB N="57" REF="75">
Woods, and skulk'd behind the Trees, firing every now and then at us, and killing three or four of our Men. We had not travell'd above two Miles in this Wood, before we came to a large &s;andy open Place that we could &s;ee no End to, and here they re&s;olv'd to &s;top our Progre&s;s; knowing if we went much further, we &s;hould be within hearing of King <HI>Samuel</HI>'s People, who were their Enemy, and would rea|dily a&s;&s;i&s;t us. They, therefore, divided them|&s;elves into &s;everal Bodies, in Order to break in upon us on every Side; and we, &s;eeing their De|&s;igns, were re&s;olv'd to &s;ell our Lives and Liber|ties as dear as we could Hereupon our Cap|tains put us in as good Order as was po&s;&s;i|ble, and divided our armed People into four Divi&s;ions: One under the Command of each Captain, and the other under Mr. <HI>John Bembo;</HI> the re&s;t who had no Arms, or were di&s;abled, we cover'd as well as we could in a little Val|ley; and with them were the two Negroe Ho&s;tages.</P>
<P>WE had not above &s;ix and thirty Fire-Arms among&s;t us, and not many more People fit to fight; &s;o that we were a poor Hand|ful to with&s;tand an Army of two or three Thou&s;and. When they found we made a Stand to oppo&s;e them, they did &s;o too; and after their accu&s;tom'd Manner (where it could be done) three or four of them in a Place threw
<PB N="58" REF="76">
up the Sand before them to cover them&s;elves, and being al&s;o beneath us down-hill, we could &s;ee only their Heads: Their Shot flew very fa&s;t over us, and we kept them in Play from Noon till &s;ix in the Afternoon; by which Time all our Shot was gone. Our People who had Money made Slugs of it; and when that was done, they took the middle Screws out of their Guns, and charg'd their Pieces with them. When they could find no more Shot, they knew not what to do: Now we began to reflect on them who advis'd the de|livering up the King, and afterwards his Son; when keeping them would have been our Safe|guard. The two Negroes in our Cu&s;tody ex|pected every Minute to be kill'd, when they &s;aw &s;ome of our People wounded; but their Death would do us no Good, and, therefore, we did not hurt them.</P>
<P>AT length it was agreed to &s;end the Wo|man <HI>Dudey</HI> and her Husband to them with a Flag of Truce, as well to protract the Time, as to know what they wanted: So we ty'd a Piece of red Silk to a Lance, and &s;ent them away. All this While they kept firing at us, not knowing what we meant by not firing again. They &s;hot at tho&s;e who carry'd the Flag, but when they &s;aw they came nearer to them, and were not arm'd, the Prince gave Orders to cea&s;e. <HI>Dudey</HI> was Interpreter, and
<PB N="59" REF="77">
told them, that our Captain was willing to make Peace with them, and would deliver up the two Ho&s;tages, and &s;end the Guns and Ammunition we took away with us, as &s;oon as we got a little further into this Country. They &s;aid they would let us go in the Morning, if we would deliver up our Arms and the Men; but they would not let us that Eve|ning becau&s;e it was dark. Their Rea&s;on was, That if we got away that Night, we &s;hould &s;end &s;ome of King's <HI>Samuel</HI>'s People, who were their utter Enemies, to revenge our&s;elves upon them.</P>
<P>WE could not tell what Re&s;olution to come to, we were willing enough to let the two Men (whom they call'd Generals) go; but we were loth to part with our Arms: Mo&s;t of us, and our Captain were of Opinion, that they follow'd us only for them, and were for delivering our Arms; but Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> Capt. <HI>Steward,</HI> and their People, with Mr. <HI>Bem|bo</HI> and &s;ome of our People were again&s;t it; Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> particularly expre&s;s'd a great Concern to &s;ee us &s;o ea&s;y to be impos'd up|on; and told us, that we might &s;ee their Words were worth nothing. But mo&s;t Voices carry'd it, and Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> being of the Opi|nion to do it, it was agreed, and in &s;hort, &s;oon done; for <HI>Dudey</HI> had no &s;ooner Orders to go and tell them, but they &s;ent People to
<PB N="60" REF="78">
fetch the Arms from us. However Capt. <HI>Drum|mand,</HI> and his Companions claim'd theirs as their own Property, which they brought on Shoar with them, &s;o would not deliver them; nor would <HI>Dudey</HI>'s Husband. The Negroes well knew we had but few left, and went away &s;eemingly contented for that Night. <HI>Dudey</HI> came back to us, and told us, that they would let us go in the Morning; and Night now coming on, we laid down on the Sand, to repo&s;e our&s;elves as well as our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Cir|cum&s;tances would admit; for be&s;ides the Hun|ger and Fatigue we &s;uffer'd, a thou&s;and Re|flections came now into our Heads of what Barbarity we had &s;een them u&s;e the Day be|fore; and that it was now in their Power to do with us what they pleas'd.</P>
<P>DAY began to break, which was the fourth of our mi&s;erable Journey, we look'd up as &s;oon as we could &s;ee one another, and im|mediately mi&s;s'd Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> Capt. <HI>Stew|ard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bembo, Dudey,</HI> and her Husband, and four or five more, who went away &s;i|lently in the Night without &s;aying any thing to us. Now our Fate approach'd, and we were come to the End of this mi&s;erable Journey; which, after &s;o bold an Attempt, we undertook for the Pre&s;ervation of our Lives and Liberty; and a TRAGICAL ON$ it was. For,</P>

IT was no &s;ooner Broad-day Light, but the Negroes came to us, and the Prince &s;tood talking with <HI>Sam</HI> a little While; Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> ask'd him what they &s;aid to him. He an|&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;They wanted to know where Cap|tain <HI>Drummond</HI> and the re&s;t were.&endq;</Q> They had &s;carce done &s;peaking, when one of the Princes took hold of me, and deliver'd me to one of his Men; there were three or four Youths more be&s;ides my&s;elf, and much about my Age, whom they &s;eiz'd, and deliver'd to their People in like manner; who bound our Hands with Ropes.</P>
<P>I was ju&s;t ty'd, when I &s;aw the &s;ame Prince &s;tick his Lance into Capt. <HI>Younge</HI>'s Throat, and afterwards into his Sides. He had no &s;ooner kill'd him, but he went on to another, and the re&s;t of his People immediately fol|low'd his Example, and &s;oon murder'd eve|ry Man; they then fell to &s;tripping them of their Cloaths, and even butchering them; for they ript open &s;everal of their Bellies. As for my part, I did not know what more mi&s;e|rable Death might be de&s;ign'd for me; for one of the Generals came with his Lance lifted up to &s;trike me, but was hinder'd by the Man who held me, giving him &s;ome Rea&s;on that I could not then under&s;tand; but I was after|ward inform'd, he told him I was re&s;erv'd for the King's Grand&s;on. But this would not hin|der
<PB N="62" REF="81">
the Officer from rifling me; for he, feel|ing my Pur&s;e without Side my Breeches, and not readily finding the Pocket-hole, in a Fury, with his Lance cut away my Breeches, and narrowly mi&s;s'd my Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>WHEN they had made an End of their But|chery, and cloath'd them&s;elves with the Gar|ments of the &s;lain, they march'd away in great Ha&s;te for fear of <HI>Port Dauphine</HI> People; for they &s;uppos'd that Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> and the re&s;t had been gone long enough to alarm them, and &s;end &s;ome Forces down to our Re&s;cue. Now whether the Negroes might not think we had &s;ent them away on Purpo&s;e to get Help; and this might enrage and provoke them to murde$ us, I can't &s;ay; but certain it is, we were per&s;u'd by a mercile&s;s Fate, and were the mo&s;t unfortunate Wretches in the Univer&s;e; for I was afterwards inform'd, that we were &s;carce march'd off the Spot, and our murder'd People not quite cold, be|fore two thou&s;and of King <HI>Samuel</HI>'s Men came down to re&s;cue us.</P>
<P>AND now I can't help thinking, that my Reader will &s;ay, Why did we not &s;end two or three of our People as &s;oon as ever we got over the River? To which I can only an&s;wer, I think we were all infatuated; for with Ea&s;e it might have been done, e&s;peci|ally &s;ince we had the Woman <HI>Dudey,</HI> to go
<PB N="63" REF="82">
with them as an Interpreter, and we might have kept <HI>Sam</HI> with us: But I &s;aw none of the&s;e Rea&s;ons then, I was but a Youth, and it could not be expected from me. And why Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> was for relea&s;ing the King, and afterwards his Son, is what I can't pretend to account for. Certainly, the Plot was well laid, and as well executed at fir&s;t, but mi&s;erably conducted afterwards; and indeed, 'tis &s;carce credible, that &s;o many People could be &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;tupid as we then were; and this I have often wonder'd at &s;ince I have attain'd to a mature Age, and could reflect with more Judgment.</P>
<P>WHAT I have to offer for a Rea&s;on in this Affair, is, <Q>&startq;That as All of us had a great Affection for our Captain's Father, &s;o it caus'd us to think the better of what his Son did.&endq;</Q> But I found &s;ince to my great Grief, that our young Capt. <HI>Younge</HI> wanted Ripene&s;s of Judgment, and Experience in the World; for Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> as I well re|member, oppos'd him in &s;everal Things, but by what&s;oever ill Conduct or Folly we might contribute to the bringing on our Fate, &s;o it was; and I am relating a real Tran&s;action of Matter of Fact, and not inventing a Fiction, or telling what might have been; or what &s;hould have been in&s;tead of what was; but thus were my Friends ma&s;&s;acred, my&s;elf and

three more made Slaves: For they &s;av'd only four of us alive, the Elde&s;t of us was not a|bove &s;ixteen Years of Age, and we were im|mediately &s;eparated, for they march'd directly off the Spot. As for <HI>Sam,</HI> I reckon him not among&s;t us, becau&s;e he went off with the Ne|groe People: I never &s;aw him after, but I heard he liv'd a Freeman under Deaan <HI>Crindo;</HI> and whether he was &s;o ju&s;t to us as he &s;hould have been is &s;omewhat doubtful. All the Way we went, I had the gha&s;tly Pro&s;pect of our Mens mangled Corps in pa&s;&s;ing thorow the Woods to the River. I was not now &s;o thir&s;ty as when we fir&s;t pa&s;s'd it, but &s;o faint for Want of Victuals that I could &s;carce &s;tand on my Legs, having had none for three Days. My Ma&s;ter &s;eem'd concern'd for me, but ha&s;ten'd over the River before he would bait; and in a proper and plea&s;ant Place by the River|&s;ide, he order'd his People to &s;top, and make a Fire, and now I was in hopes of eating; for &s;ome of his Servants having carry'd Bee$ on their Backs, they cut it into long Pieces, like Ropes, with the Hyde, and dre&s;s'd, and eat it half-roa&s;ted according to their Cu&s;tom, and gave it me in the &s;ame Manner; this I thought the &s;weete&s;t Mor&s;el I ever eat in my Life; tho' a Beggar in <HI>England</HI> would not have touch'd it. We re&s;ted here about an Hour, when he who had the Care of me made

Signs to know if I was able to walk; and I, being a little refre&s;h'd, got up and travell'd the remaining Part of the Day with more Ea&s;e $han I expected; they walking lei&s;urely, as I perceiv'd, on purpo&s;e to favour me.</P>
<P>AT Night we came to a Wood, where we were to lodge; and there we met three or four Men whom my Ma&s;ter had &s;ent to look for &s;ome Cattle, and they brought with them $wo Bullocks; one of which my Ma&s;ter &s;ent $o his Brother, for him and his People, and $he other was kill'd for us; for the Army was now &s;eparated, and every Body going home with their re&s;pective Chief to their own Habitation. Here my Ma&s;ter came to me, $nd gave me a Lance, pointing to me to cut $ut &s;ome Beef for my&s;elf. I cut about a Pound without the Hyde, which he, perceiving, impu|$ed to my Ignorance, and &s;o cut a Piece with the Hyde, and dre&s;s'd it him&s;elf for me; which I $at, not daring to refu&s;e it. After Supper eve|$y Man went to pulling up Gra&s;s by the Roots $word$ lye on, and my Guardian pull'd enough $or him&s;elf and me; I then laid my&s;elf down, $nd he laid by me, but his black Skin &s;mell'd $word$ &s;trong, that I was forc'd to turn my Back $n him all Night. I had but little Re&s;t, for $he horrid Spectacle of my ma&s;&s;acred Friends $as con&s;tantly before me, and made me &s;tart $om Sleep as &s;oon as I clos'd my Eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="85">
AT Break of Day we aro&s;e, and after the u&s;ual Repa&s;t march'd on till Noon, when we baited among &s;ome &s;hady Trees near a Pond of Water: This very Pond, I per|ceiv'd, we had pa&s;s'd by three Days before, within two hundred Yards, when we were dy|ing with Thir&s;t, and the Negroes told us there was no Water near us.</P>
<P>WHILE &s;ome were making a Fire, I ob&s;erv'd &s;everal others were digging up and down among the Gra&s;s. I wonder'd what they were doing, and went toward one of them, whom I found pulling out of the Ground a long white Root, which I knew to be a <HI>Yam,</HI> having &s;een them at <HI>Bengal;</HI> they &s;oon furni&s;h'd them&s;elves with what they wanted. I found they grew wild; &s;ome of them were a Yard long, and as thick as the Calf of One's Leg; they gave me &s;ome, which I roa&s;ted and eat, with great Plea&s;ure, in&s;tead of Bread with my Beef: They are very good Food.</P>
<P>WE came that Evening to a little Town, which we no &s;ooner enter'd, but the Women and Children came running about me, pinch|ing and &s;triking me with the Back of their Hands, and &s;hewing other Signs of Deri&s;ion and Contempt; at which I could not forbear weeping, but when my Guardian ob&s;erv'd it, he came and drove them away. All the empty Hou&s;es were taken up by my Ma&s;ter, his Bro|ther,
<PB N="67" REF="86">
and other Head-men, &s;o that my Guar|dian and I lay in the open Air. The Abu&s;es I met with from the Women and Children, put a thou&s;and di&s;tracting Thoughts into my Head; as, <Q>&startq;that I might be kept alive only to be carry'd to the King and his Son; who would, probably, be fill'd with Re&s;ent|ment at our late &s;eizing, and making them Pri&s;oners; and to gratify their Plea&s;ure and Revenge, might order me to be put to Death before their Faces by &s;ome very horrible Torments.&endq;</Q> Such Thoughts as the&s;e &s;o di&s;|order'd me, that when once thro' Wearine&s;s I fell into a Slumber, I had a terrible Dream, which &s;o frighted me, that I &s;tarted up|right, and trembl'd in every Joint; and no Sleep could I get that Night.</P>
<P>WHEN it was broad Day-light we march'd on our Way homeward (for now I mu&s;t call it &s;o) and in three or four Hour's Time we arriv'd at a pretty large Town, with three great <HI>Tamarind</HI> Trees before it. One of the Negroes carry'd a large Shell, which, as &s;oon as he blow'd, &s;ounded like a Po&s;t-boy's Horn. This brought the Women to a great Hou&s;e in the Middle of the Town about twelve Foot high; which I &s;oon found to be my Ma&s;ter's. He had &s;carce &s;eated him&s;elf at his Door, when his Wife came out crawling $n her Hands and Knees till &s;he came to him,
<PB N="68" REF="87">
and then lick'd his Feet; when &s;he had done, his Mother did the &s;ame; and all the Women in the Town &s;aluted their Husbands in the &s;ame Manner: Then every one went to their own Home, except my Ma&s;ter's Brother, who, tho' he had a Hou&s;e, had no Wife to go to, and &s;o he &s;taid.</P>
<P>MY Mi&s;tre&s;s beckon'd me to go in and &s;it down, I perceiv'd a great deal of &s;erious Di&s;|cour&s;e pa&s;s'd between my Ma&s;ter and her; and by her looking &s;o earne&s;tly at me, while he was talking, I conjectur'd he was telling our tragical Story; and I ob&s;erv'd the Tears to &s;tand in her Eyes. She order'd &s;ome Carra|vances to be boil'd for our Dinner, they are like <HI>grey Peas;</HI> &s;he gave me &s;ome, but they look'd as if they had been boil'd in dirty Water: She perceiving I did not like them, &s;train'd them off the Water, and put &s;ome Milk to them; and then I made a tolerable Meal of them. She gave me a Mat to lye down on, and a Piece of Callico about two Yards to cover me. She made me under&s;tand that &s;he wanted to know my Name, which $ told her was <HI>Robin.</HI> I, having receiv'd &s;o much Civility from my Mi&s;tre&s;s, began to be better &s;atisfy'd than before; and then laid me down, and &s;lept without any Fear or Care, as near as I could gue&s;s, about four Hours by the Sun. When I wak'd, my Mi&s;tre&s;s call'd
<PB N="69" REF="88">
me by my Name, and gave me &s;ome Milk to drink. She talk'd a great deal to me, but I under&s;tood not a Word &s;he &s;aid. My Ma|&s;ter was all this While &s;itting with his Bro|ther without the Door, regaling them&s;elves with drinking <HI>Toake.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN Night came, I found I was to lye in the &s;ame Place; for there was no other Room. My Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s lay in the Middle, and the whole Hou&s;e was not above fourteen Foot long and twelve wide; &s;o that I laid a-cro&s;s clo&s;e to his Feet. On this manner I liv'd, and lay three or four Nights, till one Night he call'd me by my Name, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to know whether I was awake; b$t I an&s;wer'd him as often as he call'd, which was three or four Times. I fancy he would have been better pleas'd if I had &s;lept &s;ound, and had not heard him; for the next Eve|ning he carry'd me to his Aunt's Hou&s;e, and made me to under&s;tand I mu&s;t lye there: At this Aunt's Hou&s;e I remain'd Day and Night, and us'd to walk out with her and her Daughter to the Plantations, which were newly made, and where they had &s;ow'd <HI>Gui|nea</HI> Corn and planted Potatoes. When we came home at Evening, I us'd to go and vi|&s;it my Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;he us'd to give me Milk, &s;ometimes fre&s;h and &s;ometimes &s;our. They were not in ha&s;te to put me to
<PB N="70" REF="89">
Work, and indeed, I could do them but little Service, being wholly ignorant of their Lan|guage; be&s;ides he did not want working Slaves, having above two hundred to &s;erve his Oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter, who&s;e Name was <HI>Deaan Me|varrow,</HI> was Grand&s;on to <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> who was ab&s;olute Lord of this Country, and his Wife was the Daughter of a King to the Northward, whom they overcame in a Battle; and &s;he was one of the Captives which <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> took: For this Rea&s;on it was &s;he took Compa&s;&s;ion on me, being her&s;elf a Slave, and in a &s;trange Country, and only preferr'd to be Wife to my Ma&s;ter by Courte&s;y.</P>
<P>I began after a While to reconcile my&s;elf to their manner of Eating, &s;eeing no better was to be had; only I would pull off &s;ome of the Hair from the Hyde of the Beef. I us'd of|ten to think how happy my Brother and Si|&s;ter liv'd at my Father's Table; and that even &s;ome Beggars in <HI>England</HI> far'd better in this re&s;pect than I did here. But when I found that No-body liv'd better I made my&s;elf ea&s;y, and had pretty well got over all my Fears of be|ing kill'd, till an Accident happen'd, which put me into mo&s;t dreadful Apprehen&s;ions for an Hour's Time. My Ma&s;ter took me along with him one Evening with &s;ome of his People into the Woods; I &s;aw Preparations for kill|ing
<PB N="71" REF="90">
and dre&s;&s;ing a Bullock, or &s;ome &s;uch Thing; but &s;eeing none to kill, and it being now dark, I ob&s;erv'd them to walk about with Caution, and to talk &s;oftly, and all the Symptoms of &s;ome &s;ecret De&s;ign; I pre&s;ently fell a-crying, and thought they were going to kill and eat me; but my Fears were &s;oon over, when I &s;aw two Slaves dragging along a Bullock with a Rope about his Horns, in who&s;e Throat my Ma&s;ter &s;tuck his Lance. They immediately fell to cutting him up, and dre&s;&s;ing the Intrails after their Manner. The Carca&s;s was divided and &s;har'd, and I ob&s;erv'd every Man went and hid his Meat in &s;ome private Place, from whence he might fetch it by Night. When our Bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;h'd, we &s;eparated and went home, &s;ome one Way and &s;ome another; they would not go in a Body for fear of being taken Notice of. I now began to find, that we were all this While &s;tealing other Folks Cattle; I had, indeed, before wonder'd, that the Aunt I liv'd with would often dre&s;s Meat in the Night; but this clear'd up the My&s;tery. Howbeit this was not the only Time I was com|pell'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t in this kind of Theft.</P>
<P>IN three or four Months Time, I began to under&s;tand the Names of common Things in their Language. I went one Day with my Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s into the Plantations, where the Slaves were hoeing the Weeds from
<PB N="72" REF="91">
Carravances, which were ju&s;t above the Ground&punc; They gave me a Hoe, but I having no Mind to work, pretended to be very ignorant, and hoed up Carravances and Weeds together; at which they laugh'd, and took away my Hoe. But this Artifice proy'd of little Service to me, for my Ma&s;ter, finding that either I could not, or would not work in the Plantations, was re&s;olv'd to &s;et me about &s;ome other Bu|&s;ine&s;s; &s;uch, at lea&s;t, as I could not do wrong&punc; So the next Day, he, &s;hewing me his Cattle, told me, I mu&s;t take Care of them, and drive them to Water; and &s;ee that they did not break into his own, and other Peoples Plan|tations. Now here is no Di&s;tinction or Pro|perty of Lands, but every Man feeds his Bea&s;ts, and pla$ts where he thinks &s;it. This Bu&s;ine&s;s I lik'd better than the other; becau&s;e there were three or four Boys more of this Town about my Age, who al&s;o had Cattle to look after: The wor&s;t was, we had a great Way to drive them to Water, and back again; be&s;ides, I had a long Tub, which held about three Gallons, to carry home with me; for all the Water we us'd in the Hou&s;e was fetch'd from this Place where the Cattle drank. Notwith&s;tand|ing this we had Time enough, for we join'd our Herds together, and in the Heat of the Day, when the Cattle would lye down in the Shade, we had three or four Hour's Time to
<PB N="73" REF="92">
go into the Woods to get wild Yams. I had been thus long in the Country, and never knew how they &s;truck Fire; till I, wanting to roa&s;t &s;ome of my Yams, ask'd the Boys where their Fire was? The unlucky Rogues &s;hew'd me their Hands, and &s;aid, <HI>Here it is;</HI> but one of them &s;oon &s;hew'd me how they did it. He took one Stick like half a Gun Ram|mer, and another a great deal thicker, both of one Sort of Wood, and rubb'd the former upon the latter, till there came a Du&s;t from it, then a Smoak, and &s;oon after Fire.</P>
<P>WE &s;ometimes went into the Woods, and &s;tole Peoples Honey, and eat it, as we found it, with the Wax. We us'd, when we could &s;pare time enough, to look for a Creature which I call a <HI>Ground-Hog;</HI> and which in their Language is call'd <HI>Tondruck.</HI> It is about the Bigne&s;s of a Cat, but its No&s;e, Eyes and Ears are like a Hog; it has Bri&s;tles al&s;o on its Back, and no Tail; the Feet are like a Rabbit's. Their chief Food is Beetles and young Snails, which they rout up with their No&s;es: They have above twenty young Ones at a Litter, to which they give &s;uck. In the colder Time of the Year (for tho' there is no Sea&s;on which can properly be call'd <HI>Winter,</HI> yet one Time of the Year is &s;en&s;ibly colder than the other) the&s;e Creatures hide them&s;elves in the Ground after a mo&s;t wonderful manner. They fir&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="93">
dig a Hole right down about two Foot deep, then they work &s;loping downwards two or three Foot one Way, and then as much ano|ther, making Angles; all the Way they work they throw the Earth behind with their Fore|feet, and make it as firm with their Hind-feet as if no Pa&s;&s;age had been made; when they have thus work'd a good Way downward and forward, they then work a-&s;lant upwards in the &s;ame manner, till they come within half a Foot of the Surface; there they make a little Hole, ju&s;t big enough for them to turn round in, and here they lye four or five Months without any Appearance of Food all the Time; and what is yet more &s;trange, they are as fat at the End of this Time as when they fir&s;t went in. It is no &s;mall Difficulty to find them, for when we have found out &s;ome Marks of the Place, where, we think, they began to dig, we are often fru&s;trated in digging after them; they work &s;o cunningly, that we know not which Way to dig for the Hole they lye in; but we take much Pains after them, for they are excellent Food; their Skin is as brown and cri&s;p as a Pig's. We eat the <HI>Hedge-Hogs</HI> too, but they are nothing near &s;o good; the&s;e al&s;o get into Holes of Trees, and hide them&s;elves all the cold Weather; where they remain for &s;ome Months, and by all that could be perceiv'd, without Food.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="94">
THIS keeping of Cattle I lik'd well enough, except in the hot Sea&s;on; when it was a great Fatigue to drive them every other Day &s;ome Miles to Water: But in the colder Sea&s;on we had no &s;uch Occa&s;ion, for there falls &s;o great a Dew, that we find it &s;ufficient to drive them into the Gra&s;s about Break of Day; and even the Inhabitants of this Part of the Country of <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> who live at a Di&s;tance from Water, go out into the Fields with two wooden Platters and a Tub, and in an Hour's Time will gather eight or ten Gallons of Dew-water: It will not keep, but will turn &s;our in a Day or two.</P>
<P>I had not liv'd this Life above a Year, when my Ma&s;ter went to War, or (as I un|der&s;tood afterward) rather to plunder a People to the We&s;tward, again&s;t whom they have an irreconcileable Enmity; they having &s;urpris'd <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Father in his Town by Night, and kill'd him.</P>
<P>MY Ma&s;ter told me I mu&s;t not look after Cattle any more; he was going to War, and had other Bu&s;ine&s;s for me. I offer'd my Ser|vice to go with him: He an&s;wer'd, they were to travel Night and Day; that it was a long and hard Journey, and I could not be able to undergo the Fatigue; but that my Bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be to look after his Wife, and be her Guardian. He gave me a &s;trict Charge
<PB N="76" REF="95">
to lye in the fame Hou&s;e with her, and ne|ver to let her go out any where without me. After giving her In&s;tructions to the &s;ame Pur|po&s;e, he took his Leave, and with mo&s;t of his People went on their Journey.</P>
<P>I now liv'd at Ea&s;e, and my Mi&s;trefs was very kind to me. I went abroad when &s;he did; eat when &s;he eat; and lay in the Hou&s;e with her; both of us punctually ob&s;erving my Ma&s;ter's Orders: Nor did I &s;ee &s;he had any Uneafine&s;s at it, or Inclination to do other|wi&s;e. But I was not &s;o ea&s;y my&s;elf, for the Thoughts of my Friends and Native Coun|try, and the little Probability I had of ever &s;eeing them again, made me very melancholy; in&s;omuch that &s;ometimes I could not for bear weeping.</P>
<P>My Mi&s;tre&s;s would often ask me whether I was &s;ick, or wanted any Thing; I was loth to tell her the Rea&s;on: But one Day, I took the Courage to tell her I wanted to &s;ee the other three Lads who were &s;av'd, and taken Captives when I was. She bid me not to con|cern my&s;elf about that, &s;he would go with me her&s;elf, and had a Curio&s;ity to hear us talk in our own Language. She enquir'd of her Neighbours where they were, who told us they were not all together; but that there was one liv'd a little Way off about four or five Miles; &s;o the next Morning we went
<PB N="77" REF="96">
thither, and ask'd for the white Boy. He was gone to carry his Fellow-Servants &s;ome Victuals to the Plantation, but on a Me&s;&s;en|ger going to him, he ran home immediately, being as de&s;irous of &s;eeing me as I was him; we embrac'd each other with great Pa&s;&s;ion, and expre&s;s'd our&s;elves rather in Tears than Words. We had been very familiar on Ship|board, and I delighted to treat him often with Punch; he being a civil Lad, and could play well on the Violin. We lamented our hard Fate, and griev'd to &s;ee how wretchedly we look'd, naked, except a &s;mall Clout about our Middles, and our Skins &s;potted like a Leopard's; for we not being us'd to be thus expos'd to the Sun, were &s;corch'd and flead, and our Skins of|ten ro&s;e up in Bli&s;ters. We condol'd each other's Misfortunes, and agreed if either got to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to give the other's Friends an Account. We enquir'd of one another after the other two Lads; but were equally ignorant what was become of them. My Mi&s;tre&s;s ob&s;erv'd us with much Attention, and &s;hew'd a deep Concern at our Grief; but with great Re|luctancy and many Tears we were forc'd at la&s;t to part.</P>
<P>WE had not been at Home two Hours, be|fore a Me&s;&s;enger arriv'd from my Ma&s;ter with News of his Succe&s;s, and that he would be at Home in a Fortnight. My Mi&s;tre&s;s, and all
<PB N="78" REF="97">
the Women who had Husbands abroad, went immediately to making of <HI>Toake.</HI> In the mean time I fell dangerou&s;ly &s;ick with Grief, but was tolerably recover'd before my Ma&s;ter's Return.</P>
<P>HE made his Entry into Town in a trium|phant Manner: The Trumpet-Shells blowing, and &s;ome People before him dancing all the Way with Guns in their Hands. At the En|trance the foremo&s;t Men fir'd their Guns to|ward the Ground; which is the Signal of a Return with Victory. <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> and his Brother <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> came after them with Attendants; next follow'd the Cattle and Slaves he had taken from the Enemy. After they were &s;eated in Form before my Ma&s;ter <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s Hou&s;e, his Wife, and the Women came as u&s;ual, and lick'd his Feet; and the Men too whom he left in the Town behind him when he went to war. I &s;tood all this While looking on, till he e&s;py'd me, and call'd me to him. I went toward him in the u&s;ual Po&s;ture of the Country when they go toward a great Man; that is, with my Hands lifted up, and in a Praying-Form. When I came near, I gave him the Compli|ment of <HI>Salamonger &V;mba;</HI> but did not kneel down as others did, having a &s;ort of &s;uper|&s;titious Reluctancy to it, thinking it an Ado|ration that I ought to pay to none but God.
<PB N="79" REF="98">
But this Excu&s;e would not &s;erve him, for he ask'd me, if I thought my&s;elf too great a Man, to pay him the &s;ame Re&s;pect his own Wife did, who was a King's Daughter; and al&s;o his own Mother. But I peremptorily re|fus'd it, and told him I would obey all his other Commands, and do what Work he pleas'd; but this I could not do. On this he fell into a Pa&s;&s;ion, telling me, how he had &s;av'd me from being kill'd among my Coun|try-men; and that I was his Slave, &amp;c. but notwith&s;tanding this, I &s;till continu'd ob&s;tinate. Hereupon he ro&s;e from his Seat, and with his Lance made a Stroke at me with all his Force; but his Brother giving it a Pu&s;h on one Side, he mi&s;s'd me. He was going to repeat his Blow, when his Brother &s;tood up between us, and begg'd for me: He refus'd to pardon me, except I would lick his Feet. His Brother de&s;ir'd he would give him a little Time to talk with me, which he did; and af|ter he had talk'd with me, and told me the Danger of not doing it, and that in &s;ubmitting to it I did no more than what many great Princes were forc'd to do, when taken Pri&s;o|ners. I found, at length, 'twas be&s;t to comply; &s;o I went in and ask'd Pardon, and perform'd the Ceremony as others had done. He told me, he readily forgave me; but would make me &s;en&s;ible I was a Slave. I did not much
<PB N="80" REF="99">
regard his Threats, for &s;eeing no Hopes of returning to <HI>England,</HI> I &s;et but little Value on my Life.</P>
<P>THE next Day I fell into another Broil much more dangerous than the former; from which I did not expect to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>MY Ma&s;ter perform'd the Ceremony of Thank&s;giving to God for his Deliverance from the Hazards of War, and for the Vic|tory obtain'd; which is done after this Man|ner: <Q>&startq;The People have in their Hou&s;es a &s;mall portable Uten&s;il con&s;ecrated to re|ligious U&s;es, and is a &s;ort of a Hou&s;hold Altar; which they call the <HI>Owley.</HI> It is made of a peculiar Wood, in Bits neatly join'd, and making almo&s;t the Form of an Half|moon with the Horns downwards, between which are plac'd two <HI>Alligator</HI>'s Teeth; this is adorn'd with divers &s;orts of Beads, and a Sa&s;h fa&s;ten'd to it behind; which a Man is to tye about his Wa&s;te when he goes to War.&endq;</Q> [I &s;hall not here pretend to give a full Account of their religious Wor|&s;hip; for I had not been long enough in the Country, to know the true Meaning of what they did and &s;aid.] <Q>&startq;&endq;However I ob&s;erv'd them to bring two Forks from the Wood, and place them in the Ground; on which was laid a Beam, &s;lender at each End, and about &s;ix Foot long, with two or three
<PB N="81" REF="100">
Pegs in it; on this they hung the <HI>Owley.</HI> Behind it was a long Pole, to which was ty'd a Bullock: They had a Pan with &s;ome live Coals, on which they &s;trow'd a &s;weet|&s;cented Gum, and plac'd it under the <HI>Owley.</HI> Then they took &s;ome of the Hairs of the Tail, and from under the Chin, and the Eye-brows of the Ox, and put them on the <HI>Owley.</HI> Then <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> my Ma&s;ter, us'd &s;ome Ge&s;ture with Knives in his Hand, and made his Prayer; in which the People join'd. They next threw the Ox on the Ground with his Legs ty'd, and the <HI>Deaan</HI> cut his Throat; for they having no Prie&s;ts, the chief Man, whether of the Country, Town, or Family, performs all divine Offices him&s;elf. The People being &s;eated on Mats round about, my Ma&s;ter call'd to me to &s;it down, and &s;ay as the People &s;aid, which I refus'd. He went on with his Devotion, and when he had done, he takes the <HI>Owley</HI> in one Hand and his Lance in the other, and came toward me, asking me, Which I would rather choo&s;e, either to a&s;&s;i&s;t in their Ceremony of re|turning Thanks, or be &s;truck thorow with his Lance. Now I, thinking this &s;ort of Wor&s;hip to be wicked Idolatry, and that they paid their Devotions to the <HI>Owley</HI> as a God, told him, I would &s;ooner dye than
<PB N="82" REF="101">
wor&s;hip fal&s;e Gods. He went back to put the <HI>Owley</HI> in its Place, and came to me: He took me by the Hand to lead me out of Town, and kill me; his Brother, and all the People about him, us'd many Argu|ments and Intreaties to per&s;uade him again&s;t killing me; but in vain, till his Brother at la&s;t grew re&s;olute, and told him, he would that Minute leave him, and &s;ee his Face no more, if he offer'd to act &s;uch a Piece of Cruelty; and ro&s;e up to be gone. When <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> &s;aw his Brother go|ing in good Earne&s;t, he call'd him back; and told him, He would &s;pare my Life, but I &s;hould have a very tire&s;ome One with him; for he would be reveng'd on me one Way or another for my Contempt of him. <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> told him, he &s;hould not concern him&s;elf about that; all he begg'd for was my Life. On this he wink'd upon me to kneel down, and lick his Feet; which I did, asking Pardon and thanking him for &s;paring me. When I got up, I, of my own Accord, kneel'd down to <HI>Deaan Sambo,</HI> and lick'd his Feet very &s;incerely and heartily, thanking him for having thus twice &s;av'd my Life.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN all Things were &s;ettl'd, I was or|der'd to my former Po&s;t of <HI>Cow-Keeper.</HI> I had a great deal of Trouble &s;ometimes with the&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="102">
Cattle, for they are very nimble and unruly; they are fine Bea&s;ts, and notwith&s;tanding their Size, which is the large&s;t in the World, they would jump over high Fences. They have a Hump between their Shoulders, almo&s;t like a Camel's, all Fat and Fle&s;h; &s;ome of which might weigh, as near as I can gue&s;s, about three or four&s;core Pound; they are al&s;o beautifully colour'd, &s;ome &s;treak'd like a Tyger, others black with white Spots, and &s;ome white with black Spots; or half black and half white. They do not give &s;o much Milk as our Cattle in <HI>England,</HI> nor will they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be milk'd at any Time, till the Calf has fir&s;t &s;uck'd; &s;o that they keep a Calf for every Cow all the Year, or till the Cow is big again; and they &s;eldom mi&s;s a Sea&s;on. Here are al|&s;o &s;ome Sheep with great heavy Tails, like <HI>Turky</HI> Sheep; but they are not woolly as ours, rather hairy as a Goat. Here are al&s;o Goats, a few, like tho&s;e in other Nations. They bring up no Hogs, there are enough in the Country, and very mi&s;chievous to the Plan|tations; for they will &s;ometimes break in, rout up and de&s;troy the Potatoes and other Things. So that we are forc'd to &s;et Traps to catch them; but in this Country of <HI>Anterndroea</HI> No|body eats them, except the poor and ordi|nary People.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="103">
WHILE I was peaceably looking after my Cattle, and every Thing &s;eem'd quiet and ea&s;y, a &s;udden Piece of News chang'd at once the Scene of our Affairs, and call'd my Ma&s;ter to War in good Earne&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is a common Practice &s;or Parties to go out, and &s;urprize their Enemies by Night, when lea&s;t expected: On the&s;e Expeditions every Man generally carries a piece of Meat in his Hand, and getting into the Town in the Dead of Night, they throw the Meat to the Dogs to prevent their Barking. When they are all enter'd, one fires a Mu&s;quet, and making no other Noi&s;e, the Inhabitants &s;uddenly ri|&s;ing, and ha&s;tily getting out of the Doors of their low Huts in a &s;tooping Po&s;ture, are &s;tabb'd with Lances; the young Ones and Wo|men they take captive, and drive away with them all the Cattle they can find, burn the Town, and return home by private unprac|tis'd Ways. On this manner did <HI>Deaan Me|varrow,</HI> his Brother, and &s;ome others of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s People enter &s;ome of the King of <HI>Mefaughla</HI>'s remote and defencele&s;s Towns; to retaliate which on <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s People, he mu&s;ters an Army of three thou&s;and Men, and enter'd <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> re&s;olving either to fight him in the Field, or attack him in his own Town <HI>Fenno-arevo,</HI> and burn it; and accordingly &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> to tell him

<P><HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> therefore, &s;ummons all his People to come to him, and be ready at hand in <HI>Fenno-arevo,</HI> or the neighbouring Villages.

His Sons were <HI>Deaan Mun|dumbo, Deaan Frukey, Deaan Trodaughe,</HI> and <HI>Deaan Chahary;</HI> but it was his great Misfor|tune, that <HI>Deaan Chahary</HI> was gone with five hundred able Men to traffick into <HI>Feraingher;</HI> which is <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>-Bay Country.</P>
<P>'Tis their Cu&s;tom in Time of War to hide their Wives, Children, and Cattle in remote &s;ecret Places in the Woods, that the Enemy may not find them when they plunder the Country; but the Women and Children are never with the Cattle, le&s;t their bellowing &s;hould make a Di&s;covery. The Women can, for the mo&s;t part, &s;ecure them&s;elves, by draw|ing a Bough after them as they go to their hiding Place; which prevents their Tract from being follow'd. On this manner did my Ma|&s;ter, and his People &s;ecure their Wives, Chil|dren and Cattle; with the latter I was left, and therefore am not able to give an exact Account of this War, knowing only what was
<PB N="86" REF="105">
told me when they came back; which in ge|neral was as follows.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THAT <HI>Deaan Woozington,</HI> the King, and his Son <HI>Chemermaundy,</HI> and <HI>Ryopheck,</HI> his Ne|phew, a gallant Man, commanded the Army of <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> enter'd the Country without Oppo&s;ition; for <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> having receiv'd his Me&s;&s;age, that he would come, and burn him in his Town, took Care fir&s;t to &s;ecure the Families and Cattle of his People, and then drew all his armed Men there, re|re&s;olving to wait his Coming; but <HI>Deaan Mundumber, Frukey,</HI> and the younger Chiefs, had not Patience to hear of his pa&s;&s;ing qui|etly without Re&s;i&s;tance; &s;o they pre&s;s'd the King again&s;t his Will to let them go out with two thou&s;and Men, and oppo&s;e him in his March. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was re&s;olute, and would not &s;tir out of his Town. This Ar|my was commanded in Chief by <HI>Deaan Mun|dumber</HI> and <HI>Frukey,</HI> who behav'd them&s;elves with great Bravery and good Conduct, fir&s;t &s;ending Word to <HI>Deaan Woozington,</HI> that they were come by their Father's Command to give him a Welcome into their Country, and hop'd he would meet them. To which he an&s;wer'd, He would a&s;&s;uredly &s;ee them, and make him&s;elf welcome; and was as good as his Word. They join'd Battle, and <HI>Mundumber</HI> was forc'd to retire; which he
<PB N="87" REF="106">
did in good Order after a &s;harp and ob&s;ti|nate Fight; in which <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI>'s Son was dangerou&s;ly wounded. <HI>Deaan Mundumber</HI> return'd to his Father with eight hundred Men, and would have per&s;uaded him to go out with his Forces, and give <HI>Deaan Woo|zington</HI> Battle; but the old King was ob&s;ti|nate, and would not: So <HI>Mundumber</HI> re|main'd with him, fortifying the Town as well as they could.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AFTER this <HI>Deaan Frukey</HI> and <HI>Trodaughe</HI> took a Pa&s;s between two Hills, and cutting down great Trees to defend them, they had en|tirely &s;top'd <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI>'s Progre&s;s, tho' he attack'd them in a vigorous Manner, and was as gallantly receiv'd and repuls'd; till <HI>Ryopheck,</HI> by the Help of a Man who knew the Country, got by a By-path behind them; and <HI>Deaan Woozington,</HI> at the &s;ame time with <HI>Ryopheck,</HI> charging them again, <HI>Frukey,</HI> and his Brethren were forc'd to re|tire; which they did with great Re&s;olu|tion thorow <HI>Ryopheck</HI>'s Party. In this Ac|tion <HI>Ryopheck,</HI> who was always in the hot|te&s;t Place, did with very much Difficulty e&s;cape.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IN the End <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> got to <HI>Fenno-arevo,</HI> and attack'd it in a vigorous Manner; but was as bravely repuls'd: <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> and his Sons re&s;i&s;ting till
<PB N="88" REF="107">
they were overpower'd; and when their Enemies were got within the Town, they even then defended every Inch of Ground, till <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> him&s;elf was forc'd to cut down &s;ome of the Trees, which are their Walls, to make a Pa&s;&s;age for their E&s;cape. He &s;o much rely'd on his own Strength and Courage, that he kept his Wife and Daugh|ter in his Hou&s;e, tho' all the other Wo|men and Children were &s;ent away; who fell into the Hands of <HI>Deaan Woozington,</HI> and were made Captives. The Town was burnt, after having been fir&s;t plunder'd of &s;uch Trifles as their Riches con&s;i&s;t in, the chief of which are <HI>Beads;</HI> the&s;e they often dig Holes for, and hide: So that there is nothing to be got but <HI>Iron Shavels, Hoes, Earthen</HI> and <HI>Wooden Di&s;hes, Spoons,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ome Cattle, indeed, they found, which were brought into the Town to &s;u&s;tain them|&s;elves during the Siege; and in &s;uch Ca&s;es the&s;e Cattle live well enough on the That|ches of the Hou&s;es. They had al&s;o fill'd a great many Tubs with Water.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was incon&s;olable for the Lo&s;s of his Wife and Daughter, and like a di|&s;tracted Man; till his Sons told him, if he would now join them, as he &s;hould have done at fir&s;t, they were yet able to deal with <HI>Deaan Woozington.</HI> And accordingly they
<PB N="89" REF="108">
mu&s;ter'd all their Forces into one Army, and made a Number equal to their Ene|mies. <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> not being appris'd of this, was detaching a thou&s;and Men to plunder the Country, &s;earch for and bring in all the Women, Children, and Cattle they could find; as they always do after an entire Victory. When <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> ap|pear'd in his View with his potent Army, and &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to tell him, he mu&s;t either deliver the Queen and Prince&s;s, with the other People and Cattle he had got, or immediately decamp, and fight them. <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> &s;ent him Word, he did not de|&s;ire to keep his Wife and Daughter, nor did he come for Slaves or Cattle, he hav|ing enough already; but he, <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> had &s;ent him a Challenge, bragging that his Strength was &s;uperiour to any of the Kings on the I&s;land by the Addition of white Men, of which he boa&s;ted to have had a great Number, and which he came to &s;ee, but finding none, he now hop'd that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Pride was a little humbl'd; &s;o he was ready to &s;end him his Wife and Daugh|ter again: But for the few Slaves and Cattle he had taken, his People &s;hould keep them to make &s;ome Recompence for the Robbe|ries, which <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> and others had com|mitted in his Country.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="109">
<Q>&startq;&endq;IN the End a Peace was concluded, and &s;worn to by the Generals of each Side, with the u&s;ual Solemnity of killing an Ox, and each General eating a Piece of the Liver from off the Point of a Lance, and wi&s;hing that whoever fires the fir&s;t Gun, it might be the De&s;truction of him. The Ceremony being over, Rejoicings were made on both Sides&punc; <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> return'd into his own Country, and <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> to rebuild his ruin'd Town, which is done almo&s;t as &s;oon as de&s;troy'd; and all his Chiefs each with his People to their re&s;pective Homes.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN we were &s;ettl'd again, I, and three Boys more, who belong'd to &s;ome principal Men of our Town were &s;ent &s;ome Miles off with two hundred Head of Cattle to live by our&s;elves, and look after them. We had not among them above five or &s;ix which gave Milk, and this was all the Provi&s;ion we had to live upon; what we wanted more, we mu&s;t &s;earch for in the Woods, and get it where, and when we could find it. My Mi&s;tre&s;s gave me an earthen Pot to warm my Milk in, a Calaba&s;h to drink out of, and a Mat to lye upon for my Bed. My Ma&s;ter gave me an Hatchet to make Fences with, and a Lance; telling me, I mu&s;t &s;ight if any Body came to &s;teal my Cattle: He al&s;o gave me a new Clout to wear after the manner of their Country, my other be|ing
<PB N="91" REF="110">
worn out; this for the ordinary People is not much broader than a Napkin: They call it a <HI>Lamber,</HI> and &s;o &s;hall I for the fu|ture; the Name of <HI>A&mdash;&s;e-Clout</HI> (by which our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen call this Garment to &s;ignify its U&s;e) being too gro&s;s an Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>WE drove our Cattle to the de&s;igned Place, and the fir&s;t Thing we &s;et about was to build us an Hou&s;e, which we &s;oon fini&s;h'd; for it took us no more Time than one Day and an half. We next fini&s;h'd our Cow-Pen, and a &s;mall One for the Calves, to keep them from &s;ucking while we milk'd the Cows. Our Hou&s;e was a poor little Hut, not well-thatch'd, and it being now the rainy Time (which is their Winter, and is &s;ometimes very cold) we had but a very indifferent Lodging. We kept a Fire, and happy was he who could fir&s;t get to lye down neare&s;t it; all the Covering we had was our Lambers, which we pull'd off to lay over us. Now, it was, I felt the Mi&s;ery of my Slavery, being almo&s;t fami&s;h'd; for good and &s;ub&s;tantial Food we could get none, ex|cept now and then a &s;mall Fowl, which creeps on the Ground; and which we took in Traps.</P>
<P>WE liv'd thus almo&s;t three Months, and having eat no other Fle&s;h, we began to con|trive the killing one of our Ma&s;ter's Bea&s;ts, and dre&s;s it &s;ecretly. A great many Projects were talk'd of, till at length I propos'd one
<PB N="92" REF="111">
which was agreed to; which was, to kill a Cow, by &s;tabbing her in the Side with a Stick made &s;harp; and make another Cow's Horn bloody, which belong'd to the &s;ame Man, that he might think it was done by goring. But then a Di&s;pute aro&s;e, who&s;e Bea&s;t &s;hould be hill'd; for every one was for &s;hifting it from his Ma&s;ter. However, I &s;oon determin'd that, by drawing Lots with four Sticks &s;horter than each other; and I &s;o manag'd it, by keeping the longe&s;t in my Hand, that it came not to my Ma&s;ter's Turn to have his Cow kill'd.</P>
<P>WHEN the Bu&s;ine&s;s was done, away ran the Boy to acquaint his Ma&s;ter, that one Heifer was kill'd by another; he came immediately with his Family, and finding a Cow with a bloody Horn, concluded it was done by her; &s;o giving it &s;ome Blows in a Pa&s;&s;ion, he fell $o cutting up the dead Bea&s;t, and gave us a good-large Piece be&s;ides the Guts and Legs; and then went home again. Thus far we &s;ucceeded well, but our chief De&s;ign was, un|der Colour of having Meat giv'n us by our Ma|&s;ters, to kill another Heifer; and if any Per|&s;on came to &s;ee us (as we were not far from People, tho' we were from our own Homes) who &s;hould ask how we came by Beef? we could tell them our Ma&s;ters gave it us. But we grew too venturous by our Succe&s;s, for one Day having kill'd one, which &s;tray'd from
<PB N="93" REF="112">
&s;ome other People among&s;t ours; our Ma&s;ters, unluckily for us, came to &s;ee their Cattle, which they found in the Cow-Pens, but none of us being near, they began to &s;u&s;pect us; and therefore, dividing them&s;elves to make a more diligent Search, one of them heard a Noi&s;e in the Wood, like cutting down Trees, where we were very bu&s;y; and, following the Sound, &s;oon &s;melt roa&s;t Meat: Our Dogs too, like our&s;elves, were &s;o hungry, that they minded nothing but their Bellies; tho' at other Times they were very watchful, and would give us Notice if a Mou&s;e did but &s;tir: Howbeit our Ma&s;ters &s;urpris'd us, and came at once among&s;t us with their Guns cock'd, cry|ing out, <HI>Vonne terach com boar;</HI> which in Eng|li&s;h is, <HI>Kill them, Sons of Bitches.</HI></P>
<P>I need not relate what a Fright we were in, expecting nothing but immediate Death; and, indeed, it prov'd but little better to the other three. They took Time to ask us who&s;e Bea&s;t it was, and being inform'd it was a &s;trange one; they told us, the Crime was the &s;ame; for if we had got the Habit of killing Cattle privately, they knew theirs mu&s;t &s;ome Time be our Prey when no others offer'd; and, therefore, were re&s;olv'd to puni&s;h us. Hereupon my Comrades Ma&s;ters took each his Slave, and in an In&s;tant (Ah, woful Fate!) ca&s;trated them. I, not liking that &s;ort of
<PB N="94" REF="113">
Puni&s;hment, fell down at my Ma&s;ter's Feet, and told him how careful I had been of his Cattle; and that I had rather run the Ri&s;que of my Life, by his &s;hooting me at a rea&s;onable Di|&s;tance, than &s;u&s;tain &s;o great a Lo&s;s. To this he li&s;ten'd, and taking me out of the Wood, he ty'd my Arms behind me round a Tree, and plac'd him&s;elf at a great Di&s;tance, (I &s;uppo&s;e about four&s;core Yards) then &s;eeming to take good Aim at me, fir'd, but mi&s;s'd me: Whe|ther he did it on purpo&s;e I can't &s;ay, but I am apt to think he did; imagining the Terror was enough, and &s;eeing how &s;everely the others were puni&s;h'd. They took their Leaves of us, telling us, if ever they found us doing the like again, nothing &s;hould &s;ave us from im|mediate Death.</P>
<P>THEY were no &s;ooner gone from us, but I began to reflect on the Inju&s;tice of our Ma&s;ters, who, tho' they had Cattle of their own, would often oblige us to go with them on &s;everal of their thievi&s;h Expeditions, and yet &s;o &s;e|verely puni&s;h'd us for one poor Crime to &s;atisfy our Hunger. However, after all, I was forc'd to be Doctor to my poor afflicted Comrades, for their Ma&s;ters took no Care of them; &s;o I warm'd &s;ome Water, and wa&s;h'd off the Blood, and dre&s;s'd their Wounds: I was al&s;o forc'd, while we remain'd there, to look after all the Cattle, and to milk them
<PB N="95" REF="114">
too; for they were not recover'd, when Or|ders was brought us to return home with our Cattle. My Comrades being but ju&s;t able to walk, I made the Me&s;&s;enger, who came to us, help to drive the Cattle.</P>
<P>WHEN I came home, I was &s;oon made &s;en|&s;ible, that <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro,</HI> King of <HI>Anteno&s;a,</HI> had giv'n my Ma&s;ter this Trouble, by march|ing his People into <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> and demanding of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> Satisfaction for the Murder of the white Men. Now, tho' this was two Years and an half before (for &s;o long I had been in the Country) yet I &s;oon heard that Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> Capt. <HI>Steward,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bembo,</HI> and the re&s;t, who e&s;cap'd the Night before the Ma&s;&s;acre, were with him; and that there had not been, in all that Time, a Ship come to <HI>Port-Dauphine,</HI> for them to return home in&punc; but that notwith&s;tanding they liv'd free, and intirely at their own Di&s;po&s;al. This <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI> was King <HI>Samuel,</HI> whom I mention'd before; who&s;e Hi&s;tory I &s;hall relate in its pro|per Place, and who&s;e Dominions were on the other Side of the River <HI>Manderra.</HI></P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner come home, but I was taken from the Cattle, and put under the Care of two Men; who were to guard me, and &s;ee that I did not run away to King <HI>Samuel.</HI> The next Day, we heard the <HI>Anteno&s;a</HI> People were within ten or twelve Miles of our Town, which put
<PB N="96" REF="115">
them all into a great Fright and Hurry. The Cattle were &s;ent one Way, and the Women and Children into the Woods another, and poor <HI>Robin,</HI> their white Slave, along with them with his Hands ty'd behind him: But I had not been long there, before a Me&s;&s;enger came in great ha&s;te to my Mi&s;tre&s;s, ordering her <Q>&startq;to &s;end me to my Ma&s;ter in the Camp; for the white Men were to buy me, and had agreed to give two Buccanere Guns.&endq;</Q> My Mi&s;tre&s;s was loth to part with me, I di&s;&s;embl'd as much as I could, and pretended I &s;hould have been glad to &s;tay with them now, &s;ince I had been &s;o long among them; tho' at the &s;ame Time I had much ado to conceal my Joy. I kneel'd down, and lick'd her Feet, thanking her for her Civilities; and away I went with the Me&s;&s;enger, in great Hopes now, of &s;eeing &s;ome of my Country|men again, and getting to <HI>England.</HI> But &s;ee how Fortune tantaliz'd me! It was about twen|ty Miles, as I gue&s;s, to the Camp, where my Ma&s;ter was; and it might be &s;omewhat after Midnight when we arriv'd there: My Ma&s;ter, &s;et a Watch over me the remaining Part of the Night, and made me &s;wear I would never tell the Hiding-places of their Wives and Cattle; which I very readily did.</P>
<P>THE next Morning King <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;ent to know if I was come, and they would let an hun|dred
<PB N="97" REF="116">
Men come down with me between the two Camps, and he would &s;end an hundred to meet them with the two Buccanere Guns. Which being agreed to, <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> order'd my Ma&s;ter to go with the Party; and King <HI>Samuel,</HI> &s;eeing them coming forward, order d his Men to go, and meet them; among whom were Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> and the re&s;t of the white Men. When we came pretty near one another, Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> being glad to &s;ee me, call'd to me by my Name; and ask'd me how I did. My Ma&s;ter, who &s;tood by me, clapp'd his Hand upon my Mouth, and vow'd if I offer'd to &s;peak he would kill me; &s;o that I dur&s;t not an&s;wer. Capt. <HI>Drummond</HI> finding I did not an&s;wer, thought, as I &s;uppo&s;e, that I could not hear; whereupon he, and the white Men came nearer to us. My Ma&s;ter &s;eeing them advancing, thought they came to take me by Force, and cheat them of the two Guns; he, therefore, order'd his Men to fire at them: So that in&s;tead of a Parley, and changing me for the two Guns, a Skirmi&s;h began; the Shot and Lances flew at one ano|ther, and both Armies advanc'd to &s;upport each other's Party. I was immediately &s;ent away under a &s;trong Guard to the Woods, where I parted from my Mi&s;tre&s;s the Night before: So that this fine Pro&s;pect of Delive|rance was only a &s;hort, tran&s;itory Dream of
<PB N="98" REF="117">
Liberty, which immediately vani&s;h'd, $and made me only feel the Mi&s;ery of Slavery more &s;en&s;ibly than before. I know not well which Way I went back, but, &s;ure I am, it was in&s;uch-like Di&s;order of Mind as a condemn'd Criminal has, when going to Execution: But in a few Hours I found my&s;elf in my former Station; my Legs in <HI>Parra-Pingo</HI> (a Fa&s;ten|ing almo&s;t like Fetters) for fear I &s;hould run away: My old Companions were about me, my Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the Women very glad to &s;ee me again; but I was too dull to compli|ment them, they could have nothing from me but Tears and Exclamations at my hard For|tune. I wi&s;h'd for Death, and was very near being gratify'd in my De&s;ire two Days after.</P>
<P>THE next Day News was brought us of <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI>'s returning back to his own Country; he being (as they &s;aid) forc'd to retire by <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> tho' the <HI>Anteno&s;a</HI> Army was twice their Number. We were al&s;o or|der'd to go home, and I was releas'd from <HI>Parra-Pingo,</HI> and allow'd to walk at Liberty; my Guard being al&s;o di&s;charg'd.</P>
<P>THE Day following came <HI>Deaan Mevarrow, Deaan Sambo,</HI> and their little Army, entring the Town with great Pomp and Grandeur, as if they had gain'd &s;ome notable Victory; tho' I heard of nothing but a little Bu&s;h-fighting and Ambu&s;cadoes. However, the <HI>Deaan</HI> &s;at
<PB N="99" REF="118">
him&s;elf down with his Brother, other Chiefs and the re&s;t in the u&s;ual Form before his Hou&s;e: My Mi&s;tre&s;s, according to Cu&s;tom crept out to lick her Hero's Feet; when &s;he had done, the re&s;t of the Women did the like; and after them the Slaves, among whom was my&s;elf. As I was getting up to go away, he bad me &s;tay; I &s;tood &s;ome Time hearing him tell his Wife, what a Coward <HI>Deaan Tu|ley-Noro</HI> was to run away, tho' he had twice their Number of Men. After he had done, he turn'd his Head, and with an angry Coun|tenance, ask'd me, <Q>&startq;What the white Men &s;aid to me when they call'd me? Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> they only ask'd me how I did? And nothing el&s;e, <HI>&s;aid he. I reply'd,</HI> No, Sir.&endq;</Q> At this he ro&s;e up, cock'd his Gun, and put|ting the Muzzle to my Brea&s;t, with his Finger to the Trigger, <HI>&s;aid,</HI> <Q>&startq;If I did not tell him the Truth he would &s;hoot me that In&s;tant.&endq;</Q> I was not much daunted, not regarding my Life in the melancholy Humour I then was, &s;o with very little Concern, I told him the &s;ame again. At which he pull'd the Trigger, but Providence being pleas'd to pre&s;erve me for &s;ome other Purpo&s;e, the Cock &s;napp'd and mi&s;s'd Fire. Whether the Prime was wet in the Pan, or by what Miracle it was, I can't &s;ay; but he took his Lance to &s;tab me, when his Brother, and the re&s;t of his chief Men ran
<PB N="100" REF="119">
in between us; and told him, <Q>&startq;It was bar|barous and cruel; and that he had better have kill'd me at fir&s;t, than to have &s;av'd me only to terrify me with Death on eve|ry trivial Occa&s;ion; there being no Rea&s;on at all for this.&endq;</Q> With much Per&s;ua&s;ion he return'd to his Seat, and told them, <Q>&startq;There was Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the white Men had form'd a Plot to do &s;ome unfair Thing; el&s;e why did they come nearer than they &s;hould have done?&endq;</Q> And, indeed, their Fears proceeded from a natural Dread they have on them of white Men, ten of whom will drive fifty black Men before them. And then Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> and the re&s;t being compleat|ly arm'd with Pi&s;tols in their Girdles, made them the more terrible to them. What was the true Rea&s;on of King <HI>Samuel</HI>'s retiring thus I don't know; but when this Broil was over, I was very inqui&s;itive to under&s;tand the whole Tran&s;action, which was thus related to me.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;King <HI>Samuel</HI>'s De&s;ign was to march di|rectly to <HI>Fenno-arcvo,</HI> and come upon <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> before he could be provided for him: His Way lay thorow a large Plain, call'd <HI>Ambovo,</HI> leading to a great Wood, which they mu&s;t al&s;o pa&s;s thorow. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> having more timely Notice than they ex|pected, laid an Ambu&s;cado in the Wood; King <HI>Samuel</HI> was lame of the Court, and

carry'd on Mens Shoulders, him and great Part of his Army they &s;uffer'd to enter the Wood, and then the Signal being given, <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Men ro&s;e, and attack'd them &s;o vigorou&s;ly, and with &s;uch Advantage, (knowing the Wood, which the others did not;) that King <HI>Samuel</HI> him&s;elf had like to have been taken; but was gallantly de|fended by the white Men, and others of his brave&s;t People. However, they were forc'd to retire into the Plain, where they encamp'd, as did al&s;o <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s People clo&s;e by the Wood-&s;ide, and even in it; &s;ecuring them&s;elves by that Means from the &s;uperior Number of the <HI>Anteno&s;a</HI> Army, which, they &s;ay, con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix thou&s;and Men; and here they came to parlying.

this Purpo&s;e: That he wonder'd <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI> &s;hould trouble him&s;elf with o|ther People's Bu&s;ine&s;s; as to the white Men who were &s;hip-wreck'd on his Coa&s;t, he look'd upon it, that the great God had &s;ent them there; he, having a potent Ene|my, and knowing the white Men to be skil|ful in War, as al&s;o of couragious Spirits, did de&s;ign not to flight the Help his Gods had &s;ent him; but to de&s;ire their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in his Wars: Accordingly he treated them with the greate&s;t Civility as Friends, and maintain'd them as well as his Country would afford, they wanting for nothing he could procure them; and after all, tho' they had, in a violent Manner, &s;eiz'd him and Prince <HI>Murnanzack,</HI> and made them Pri|&s;oners, he would conde&s;cend &s;o far to <HI>Tuley-Noro</HI> to tell him (tho' under no Obligations to give him an Account of his Actions or make Excu&s;es) that neither him&s;elf nor Prince <HI>Murnanzack</HI> were pre&s;ent, or any ways aiding or a&s;&s;i&s;ting in their Deaths; but that Action was done by &s;ome of his Sons and Nephews, to revenge their bar|barous &s;eizing him and Prince <HI>Murnanzack.</HI> And to convince him, he does not tell him this as an Excu&s;e thro' a mean-&s;pirited Fear; &s;ince his Sons did think fit to do it, he will ju&s;tify and defend them in it; and thinks
<PB N="103" REF="122">
they did the white Men Ju&s;tice: That he knows but of one living out of four Boys that were &s;av'd at that Time; who, he finds by Inquiry, is in <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s Hands; as to the other three, one dy'd by Sickne&s;s, another was kill'd by his Ma&s;ter for his Wickedne&s;s; and the third is run away, or lo&s;t; for No-body could tell what became of him: And as to him who was living, he &s;hould not have him, without giving &s;uch a Price as his Ma&s;ter thought proper.</Q></P>
<P>Now I am apt to think by &s;everal Circum|&s;tances, that this An&s;wer might &s;eem to King <HI>Samuel</HI> to carry &s;ome Rea&s;on with it; and That, in my Opinion, prevail'd more on him to re|turn to <HI>Anteno&s;a,</HI> than all the Force my brag|ging Ma&s;ter talk'd of, or than all that <HI>Crindo</HI>'s Army was able to do.</P>
<P>HOWEVER they told me, that King <HI>Samuel,</HI> in his Reply to this, excus'd the Violence the white Men offer'd to <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> by &s;ay|ing, <Q>&startq;That they did it only to &s;ecure their own Flight from him for their Liberty; that they did not, nor ever de&s;ign'd to hurt, or wrong him: However &s;ince there was no rai&s;ing the dead to Life, if he would &s;end &s;ix hundred Head of Cattle, it &s;hould be taken for a Satisfaction: As for me, he was content to buy me; and de&s;ir'd to know
<PB N="104" REF="123">
what they demanded for me. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> &s;ent Word, That as to me, they requir'd two Buccaneer Guns; but as to his De|mand of &s;ix hundred Head of Cattle, he was not to have Laws and arbitrary Com|mands impos'd on him by any King in the World; that if they wanted Provi&s;ion, he was ready to make them a Pre&s;ent; for it &s;hould not be &s;aid <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI> came to &s;ee him, and he would not give him a Dinner; and, therefore, had order'd his Peo|ple to give him &s;ix Oxen, and a Bull.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>SOME &s;aid, King <HI>Samuel</HI> re&s;ented this as an Affront, and would have attack'd the <HI>Antern|droeans</HI> immediately; but was di&s;&s;uaded by Capt. <HI>Drummond,</HI> and the re&s;t, there being no Likelyhood of any Engagement but Bu&s;h-fight|ing; which mu&s;t be to the Advantage of the <HI>Anterndrocans</HI> in their own Country; and in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Wood: So finding that no other Terms were to be had, they accepted of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Pre&s;ent, which his Men did indeed want, and went on in their Parley about me; the Succe&s;s of which you have already &s;een. But,</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over a Piece of Super&s;ti|tion practis'd here: There are a Sort of People in this Country, who pretend to a great deal of Knowledge in the Magical Virtue of Roots, Trees, Plants, and other &s;uch like Matters;
<PB N="105" REF="124">
and of their Power to perform &s;trange Things by Charms made of them. One of the&s;e Con|jurers, or <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee</HI> (as the Natives call them) advis'd <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> to take a certain Powder which he gave him, and to &s;trip off a Piece of the Skin of the Tail of the Bull, which he ad|vis'd &s;hould be a white One too, becau&s;e <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI> was a whiti&s;h Man; and to put this Magical Powder on the Wound, as al&s;o to mix &s;ome of it with Water, and give it to the Bull to drink before it was giv'n to the <HI>Anteno&s;a</HI> Men. Now this was not done to make the Creature un|whol&s;ome, and thereby procure Deaths or Di&s;|ea&s;es among&s;t their Enemies in the common Way; but it was expected to work &s;ome Witch|craft, or &s;uper-natural Operation on them. Now it happen'd in two Months after this, that King <HI>Samuel</HI> died; he was at that Time very infirm, and had been &s;o long before; which with the Fatigue of this Journey might ha&s;ten his End. But there were not wanting People &s;uper&s;titious enough, to think his Death was the Effect of this Conjuration, tho' we might be &s;ure he eat none of the Bull, there being Oxen at the &s;ame Time; for the&s;e Ne|groes would not make Oxen any more than we white Men, did they not know them to be, in every re&s;pect, preferable to Bulls.</P>
<P>AND &s;ince I have had an Occa&s;ion to &s;ay &s;o much of King <HI>Samuel,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e my Reader

will have Curio&s;ity enough to de&s;ire to know, who this King with a Chri&s;tian Name was; and for what Rea&s;on he &s;hould endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, and revenge our Wrongs. His living near the Sea, and the Riches he and his People got by trading with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> may pa&s;s as a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for the Friend&s;hip this King &s;hew'd to our People; and, indeed, all over the I&s;land they are Friends to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> ex|cept in &s;ome few Places remote from the Sea: But King <HI>Samuel</HI>'s Hi&s;tory being very &s;ingu|lar, I &s;hall here relate it as I learn'd it at Times from the Natives. Whether any of the <HI>French</HI> Authors of Voyages have wrote any Thing of him I know not; nor have I had the Opportunity of &s;eeing their Hi&s;tories of <HI>Ma|daga&s;car</HI> to compare with this of mine: It is exactly as the People them&s;elves told me, and I &s;hall not alter, or vary from their Account of it, whether it is agreeable to what others have &s;aid, or no.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THIS Part of the Country, to which the <HI>French</HI> have given the Name of <HI>Port-Dau|phine,</HI> is call'd, in the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Language, <HI>Anteno&s;a.</HI> About ninety Years ago, there came hither two <HI>French</HI> Ships; on what Ac|count, Voyage, or Bu&s;ine&s;s they were, I can't learn; but they came to an Anchor clo&s;e under the Land in a very good Har|bour. The Captains ob&s;erving that there
<PB N="107" REF="126">
were Plenty of Cattle, and all Provi&s;ions, as al&s;o a very good Soil, concluded that one of them &s;hould &s;tay here, and make a Settlement; hereupon they ca&s;t Lots who &s;hould remain on the I&s;land, and he on whom the Lot fell was Captain <HI>Me&s;merrico.</HI></Q> [I mu&s;t here de&s;ire my Reader to take Notice, that this is the Name the Natives told me, who, very likely, being unlearned, may pro|nounce it very different from the true Name; but be&s;ides, as it is al&s;o &s;ome Time &s;ince, and they have no Writings or Records of Things, &s;o con&s;equently, they can have no Hi&s;tory, but by Tradition, as the Father tells the Son, and &s;o on to &s;ucceeding Generations.] <Q>&startq;&endq;This Captain <HI>Me&s;merrico</HI> landed with two hundred white Men, well arm'd, with Store of Am|munition and other Nece&s;&s;aries proper for the Building of a Fort, which they imme|diately began. The Natives no &s;ooner ob|&s;erv'd their Intention, but they endeavour'd to hinder them; this ca$$$ a War, in which the <HI>French</HI> were the Conquerors, who took at &s;everal Times many Pri&s;oners: In this War, the King of <HI>Anteno&s;a</HI> and his Brother were kill'd; and among&s;t many o|ther Children which were taken, the King's Son was one. When the <HI>French</HI> had &s;up|pre&s;s'd the Natives, and built their Fort, the Ships &s;ail'd away to <HI>France,</HI> and carry'd

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;BY that Time the Ships had been gone a Year, the Natives began to be better re|concil'd to the <HI>French-men;</HI> only they pri|vately re&s;ented the carrying away their young Prince, and did not well like to be govern'd at the Plea&s;ure of Foreigners; however the <HI>French,</HI> by their obliging Be|haviour, gain'd Friend&s;hip among them; marrying, and living up and down at Peace in &s;everal Towns di&s;tant from each other, not above five or &s;ix in a Place. They al&s;o join'd with the Natives in their Wars a|gain&s;t a King, who liv'd to the North-ward, whom they routed, and took many Slaves and Cattle. On this manner they liv'd &s;ome Years with great Security, neglecting their Fort, and &s;preading them&s;elves all over the whole Country of <HI>Anteno&s;a;</HI> having Families and many Children, the Natives ob&s;erving them to increa&s;e, and remembring their Prince whom they barbarou&s;ly &s;ent away, and &s;ee|ing them thus di&s;pers'd, thought this the only Opportunity to free them&s;elves from the U&s;urpation of Foreigners: Hereupon they form'd a Plot to de&s;troy all the white Men in one Day; and accordingly a <HI>Wed|ne&s;day</HI> being appointed, it was executed; and they left not a white Man alive in <HI>Anteno&s;a.</HI></Q></P>

<Q>&startq;&endq;NOT long after a <HI>French</HI> Ship came there as u&s;ual: The <HI>Maurominters,</HI> or Slaves, who had a Love for the <HI>French,</HI> got a Canoe, and went off to them, and told them their Coun|try-men were all murder'd. The Captain was much concern'd at the News, but could not revenge them; being glad to get &s;afe away him&s;elf, without once attempting to go on Shore.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THEY, having now No-body to interrupt them, put their Government into its Ori|ginal Form, by choo&s;ing a King who was the neare&s;t related to their former; for there was no other Son but him whom the <HI>French</HI> took captive. Thus they liv'd &s;e|veral Years, no <HI>French</HI> Ship ever daring to come near them; but now and then an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Ship came, with whom they traded very civilly and hone&s;tly.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AFTER &s;ome Years a <HI>French</HI> Ship, home|ward bound from <HI>India,</HI> was in great Streights for Water and Provi&s;ion, and could not get about the <HI>Cape. Port-Dauphine</HI> lay very con|venient for him, but he knew the Natives were their mortal Enemies, and the Occa|&s;ion; and therefore re&s;olv'd to make U&s;e of this Stratagem. He pretended he was an Amba&s;&s;ador from the <HI>French</HI> King, and accordingly went on Shoar in great State, and with proper Attendants. Their Ship
<PB N="110" REF="129">
anchor'd as near as they could, that they might be within the Reach of their Guns, if any Violence &s;hould be offer'd to them. The Natives, who came down to &s;peak to them, ask'd if they were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French:</HI> They told them the latter, but that they were &s;ent by the <HI>French</HI> King with Pre&s;ents, and to make a Peace with them. The King they had cho&s;en, whom I mention'd before, had been dead about a Month pa&s;t, and no new One yet elected in his Room; but the old Queen (Mother of the Prince they had carry'd away &s;ome Years before) who was &s;till living, order'd the Amba&s;&s;ador to be conducted to her Hou&s;e. His Men carry'd a great many Things of no great Co&s;t a|mong&s;t them, but &s;uch as they knew to be greatly valu'd in this Country; and which, he was a&s;&s;ur'd, would plea&s;e her. The&s;e he pre&s;ented in the Name of the <HI>French</HI> King; and &s;he te&s;tify'd her Satisfaction in receiving them, by entertaining the Cap|tain in the be&s;t Manner &s;he could invent. This Day pa&s;t in Compliments, Pre&s;enting, and Ceremony, &s;o far as their little Know|ledge carry'd them; the next Day &s;he &s;ent for the Captain, and told him, they mu&s;t both &s;wear according to the Cu&s;tom of her Country.</Q></P>

<Q>&startq;&endq;THE Captain having agreed to the Ce|remony, it was perform'd after the follow|ing Manner: The holy <HI>Owley,</HI> which we have already de&s;crib'd, was brought out, and hung on a Piece of Wood laid a-cro&s;s two Forks, all which was cut down on purpo&s;e; as was al&s;o a long Pole, to which the Bullock was ty'd; this was provided by the Queen, and being kill'd, they took &s;ome of the Tail, and &s;ome of the Hair of the No&s;e and Eye-brows, and put them on &s;ome live Coals &s;moaking under the <HI>Owley;</HI> they then took &s;ome of the Blood, which they &s;prinkl'd on it, and on the Beam it hung on; the Liver al&s;o was roa&s;ted, and a Piece of that plac'd on it; two Pieces were put on two Lances, and the&s;e two Lances &s;tuck in the Ground betwixt the Queen and the Amba&s;&s;ador; the Queen &s;wore fir&s;t to this Purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>I Swear by the Great God above, by the Four Gods of the Four Quarters of the World, by the Spirits of my Forefathers, and before this holy <HI>Owley,</HI> that neither My&s;elf, nor any of my Off|&s;pring, or People, who a&s;&s;i&s;t at this &s;olemn Oath, for them&s;elves and their Off-&s;pring, will wittingly kill any <HI>French-man,</HI> unle&s;s they fir&s;t kill &s;ome of us; and if We, or any of &V;s, mean any other but the plain and hone&s;t Truth by This, may this

Liver, which I now eat, be turn'd into Poi&s;on in my Belly, and kill me in&s;tantly.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;WHEN &s;he had &s;aid this, &s;he took the Piece of Liver off the Lance, and eat it; when &s;he had done, the Amba&s;&s;ador did the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THE Captain &s;taid on Shoar three or four Days after this, &s;ending on Board what Pro|vi&s;ion his People wanted. A firm Friend|&s;hip being now e&s;tabli&s;h'd between them, they &s;trove who &s;hould outdo the other in Civilities. The Captain invited the Queen to go on board his Ship, and &s;he very rea|dily went with &s;everal of the Chief of her People; and were treated by the Captain with Magnificence, and very much to her Satisfaction. She return'd on Shore in the Ship's Boat, and after Landing did not im|mediately walk up from the Sea-&s;ide, but &s;tood looking about her. The <HI>French-men,</HI> not regarding the Pre&s;ence of the black Queen, &s;tripp'd, and &s;wam about to wa&s;h and cool them&s;elves; the Queen could not help ob&s;erving the Whitene&s;s of their Skins, which being &s;o different from theirs, &s;he indulg'd her Curio&s;ity in looking on them; till &s;eeing one Man, who&s;e Skin was much darker than the re&s;t of his Companions, as he came toward the Shoar, and was going
<PB N="113" REF="132">
to put on his Cloaths, &s;he e&s;py'd a Mole under his left Pap; &s;he went near to him im|mediately, and, looking more diligently on it, hinder'd him from putting on his Shirt. She cry'd out, &s;he was po&s;itive he was her Son, who had been carry'd away, when a Child, many Years before; and had not Patience to contain her&s;elf, but ran to him, crying for Joy that &s;he had found her Son, and threw her Arms about his Neck. This &s;ur|pris'd all the People, as well Blacks as Whites, till having recover'd her&s;elf a little, &s;he turn'd to them, and told them this was her Son; and &s;hew'd them the Mark. They, who had known the young Prince, came near, view'd the Mole, and were of her Opinion, that it mu&s;t be he, and no other. The <HI>French-men</HI> could not tell what to make of this, nor what might be the Con&s;equence; and began to be in Fear.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THE Captain, therefore, taking the Man a&s;ide, advis'd him to give as cunning&punc;An|&s;wers as he could to what Que&s;tions they &s;hould ask him for their Safety's &s;ake: Now there were &s;everal Blacks who &s;poke <HI>French,</HI> and by their Means the <HI>French-men</HI> as &s;oon under&s;tood the Queen as them&s;elves did. She bid the&s;e ask him, <HI>If he knew the Coun|try he was born in?</HI> He an&s;wer'd, <HI>He could remember nothing of it, for he was carry'd from</HI>

<HI>his Native Place when a Child.</HI> She ask'd him, <HI>If he knew her?</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>He could not pretend to &s;ay he did; but he thought &s;he re|&s;embl'd &s;omebody he was us'd to when young:</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THIS confirm'd them, more and more in their Opinion: As to his being white skin'd, that, they thought, might ea&s;ily be from his wearing Cloaths during the Time he was ab&s;ent from thence; his Hair was black like theirs, &s;o that it was concluded it mu&s;t be their Prince. The Queen was in Rap|tures of Joy for finding her Son, and the Na|tives were for choo&s;ing him King directly; he being the next Heir. They ask'd him, <HI>What Name he went by?</HI> He told them, <HI>He never remember'd him&s;elf to be call'd by any other Name than</HI> Samuel; but they gave him what, they thought, was his Origi|nal Name, compounded with <HI>Tuley;</HI> which &s;ignify'd <HI>His Return,</HI> or <HI>Arrival:</HI> So they call'd him <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro, [Deaan,</HI> it may be ob&s;erv'd, is an univer&s;al Title of Honour, &s;ignifying <HI>Lord;]</HI> and he was al&s;o further &s;aluted immediately with the Title of <HI>Panzacker</HI> (which is <HI>King)</HI> of <HI>Anteno&s;a.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THE Captain, and other <HI>French-men</HI> were &s;urpris'd to find the Man acted his Part &s;o well; not perceiving at fir&s;t that he was in Earne&s;t, and was as ready to be made a King as they were to choo&s;e him; tho' it
<PB N="115" REF="134">
was in this heatheni&s;h Place. He had here immediately under his Command twelve thou&s;and fighting Men, and a fine, large, plentiful Country to live in at his Plea|&s;ure. The Ship &s;ail'd away, and left him; but as often as the <HI>French</HI> had Occa&s;ion for what this I&s;land afforded, they us'd to put into <HI>Port-Dauphine;</HI></Q> and trade with him.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;ABOUT three or four Years before we were ca&s;t away, it happen'd that a <HI>French</HI> Ship being there, &s;ome of the Men got drunk on Shoar; and quarrelling with &s;ome of the Natives, told them, King <HI>Samuel</HI> was not their lawful King; but that he was yet living in <HI>France.</HI> This might have been of very ill Con&s;equence to him, but he took &s;uch Care to prevent it as no One could blame him for: He &s;ent for the Man who &s;poke the Words, and order'd him to be &s;hot to Death; he al&s;o commanded his Companions to depart forthwith, and told them, That if ever they, or any of their Country-men came there again, he would take Care they &s;hould never go alive off the I&s;land.&endq;</Q> And this la&s;t Adventure be|ing known to our Man, who advis'd us again&s;t putting into <HI>Port-Dauphine,</HI> made him &s;ay, <HI>He was barbarous to all white People;</HI> but he had heard the Story imperfectly, and from thence aro&s;e the Mi&s;take which prov'd &s;o fatal to us.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="135">
BY this Conference between <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> and King <HI>Samuel,</HI> I came to the Knowledge of what happen'd to the white Boys, who were taken with me; &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as the Natives knew them&s;elves: As al&s;o, that the Prince, who was &s;eis'd by our People, and made Pri&s;oner with <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> their King, was not, &s;trictly &s;peaking, his Son, but <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> his Nephew; who&s;e Right <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> had u|&s;urp'd, as we &s;hall find hereafter: But a Word in their Language &s;ignifying <HI>Off-&s;pring,</HI> and comprehending as well <HI>Grand&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Nephews</HI> as <HI>Sons,</HI> was the Cau&s;e we did not di&s;tingui&s;h the Difference. But,</P>
<P>To return to my own Hi&s;tory: The Fray between my Ma&s;ter and me being over, by the Iuterce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Deaan Sambo,</HI> and the other Chiefs, he order'd me to be carry'd to the Plantations to work there; telling me, <Q>&startq;If I hoed the Carravances and Weeds toge|ther, as I did at fir&s;t; he would hoe my St&mdash;es out.&endq;</Q> I went away very content|edly, not caring where I was, &s;o it was where I could not &s;ee him; for he now became more hateful to me than ever.</P>
<P>OUR Plantation was about five Miles from Home, and he came not above once in a Month to &s;ee us. He took no Care for my Maintenance, nor the re&s;t of his Slaves; we mu&s;t provide for our&s;elves. But then every
<PB N="117" REF="136">
Man had as much Land as he pleas'd to cul|tivate for his own U&s;e; and one Day in a Week to work for him&s;elf. When I fir&s;t came, I found it hard enough to keep my&s;elf alive; I was oblig'd on Moon-light Nights, after I had done my Ma&s;ter's Work, to go in|to the Woods, and look for wild Yams for my Su&s;tenance, and many Times I could find no more than was &s;ufficient for one Meal; which, however, I was forc'd to lengthen out for the next Day's Support.</P>
<P>MY Fellow-Slaves were, indeed, as kind to me as they could a&s;ford; they having Planta|tions of their own: They gave me Carra|vances, and &s;uch Victuals at they had; e&s;pe|cially on dark Nights, and Times when I could not &s;hift for my&s;elf. I work'd a Night or two in a Week, in clearing and burning the Weeds, and Things off the Piece of Ground I de&s;ign'd for my own Plantation; but the &s;peedie&s;t Thing I could plant to produce my&s;elf Food was Potatoes. I liv'd this mi|&s;erable Life for two or three Months, and it was a Year before I was rightly &s;ettl'd, and had Plenty.</P>
<P>HONEY is one of the mo&s;t profitable and u&s;eful Things this Country produces; and they have it in Plenty, if they will take proper Care. There's little Trouble in managing Bees, which are here very numerous; they will readily come

to their Hives, or <HI>Tohokes,</HI> as the Natives call them; and in making the&s;e I took a particu|lar Delight: They are Part of the Body of a Tree, call'd <HI>Fontuoletch,</HI> fir&s;t cut off about a Yard long, and then &s;plit right down; having dug out the Middle with our Hatchets (in which we are not very nice) we bind the two Parts together in their natural Po&s;ition, &s;o that the Hive is a hollow Cylinder; we leave a Hole at the Bottom for them to enter: And this is all the Care that need be taken.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t two hundred of the&s;e Hives; but &s;ome of my Neighbours us'd often to rob them: Once I catch'd a Boy, following him by his Track, and carry'd him to his Father; about three or four Days after, I went to demand Satisfaction for the Honey he &s;tole, and de&s;troying my Hives; his Fa|ther made very few Words with me, but gave me two Hatchets, a Hoe, and ten Strings of yellow Beads; I was very well contented with this, thinking my&s;elf as rich as a grent Merchant. But &s;oon after, I happen'd on a &s;ecure Way of pre&s;erving my Honey; the relating which will give a ju&s;t Notion of al|mo&s;t the only Super&s;tition the&s;e People are addicted to.</P>

his Travels from <HI>Anteno&s;a</HI> into our Country, and in his Way took up his Lodging at my Ma&s;ter's Town; my Ma&s;ter had been that Day in the Woods to &s;ee his Bee-Hives, and found a great many of them robb'd: He re|turn'd in the Evening in a very great Pa&s;&s;ion, threatning to &s;hoot whom&s;oever he &s;hould catch &s;tealing his Honey. This <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee</HI> com|ing in this Juncture to pay his Re&s;pects to him, and hearing his Complaint, told him, he could give him &s;omewhat that would ef|fectually prevent his Honey from being &s;tole; but he was afraid to tell it him, becau&s;e it would kill that Per&s;on who eat the &s;tolen Honey: <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> &s;aid, he did not care if they were all kill'd. In the End they agreed, the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee</HI> was to have two Cows and two Calves, if it effected the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and was to &s;tay to &s;ee the Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>THE next Morning he goes into the Woods, and &s;ingles out a Tree call'd <HI>Roe-bouche;</HI> we have no &s;uch-like in <HI>England,</HI> nor is it much to the Purpo&s;e; for I &s;uppo&s;e any Tree would have done his Bu&s;ine&s;s as well. He goes to the Ea&s;tward of this Tree, and dug up a Piece of its Root, and then he goes to the We&s;tward, and dug up another Piece of the Root of the &s;ame Tree; he takes the Ea&s;tern Root, and directs <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> to rub it on a Stone with a little Water, and &s;prinkle
<PB N="120" REF="139">
the Water among the Bees and Honey-combs in the Hives; and if any one &s;teals the Ho|ney and eats it, in a Quarter of a Day (for they reckon not by Hours) they will &s;well, and break out in Spots like a Leopard from Head to Foot; and in three Days they will dye. This pleas'd <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> but then &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;How &s;hall I do, when I want to to u&s;e my Honey for my&s;elf and Family?&endq;</Q> Says the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;I have here a Remedy for that in my Hand, which is no other than a Root of the &s;ame Tree, but dug to the We&s;t; and when you go to take your Honey, only rub a little of this on ano|ther Stone (not the &s;ame) with Water, and &s;prinkle the Hives; then will the Ea&s;tern Root have no Power: But if any Body has &s;tole your Honey, and finds the Effects of it, and you have a Mind to be merciful, and &s;ave his Life, give him &s;ome of this We&s;tern Root, which he call'd <HI>Vau|hovalumy,</HI> or Root of Life; it will take off all the Swelling and Spots, and re&s;tore him to Health.</Q></P>
<P>ALL this was mighty well, but the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s was to try if it would an&s;wer all the&s;e $word$ Pretences of the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee,</HI> which <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> was very eager to know; and there|fore, having &s;prinkl'd his Hives with the Ea&s;t|ern Root according to Directions, he propos'd
<PB N="121" REF="140">
it to &s;everal to try it, and he would give them an Ox for their Pains; but No-body offering them&s;elves, he order'd it to be cry'd about the Country, and by this Means it came to my Ears. Now I had before ob&s;erv'd the Sim|plicity of the People on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, and that the&s;e <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ees</HI> made a Property of their Ignorance, to cheat and impo&s;e on them; I knew there was nothing el&s;e in this, and that it had already the Effect de&s;ir'd, by terrify|ing the People; and having a great deal of Honey my&s;elf, I thought, if I could, by any Means, pretend I had the Secret it would pre|&s;erve mine. I, therefore, &s;ent Word to my Ma&s;ter that I would try it; provided he would communicate the Secret to me if I &s;urviv'd the Experiment. He very readily &s;ent for me, and agreed to it, promi&s;ing me over and a|bove a great Reward.</P>
<P>I went with my Ma&s;ter and &s;everal other People to the Hive, which was &s;prinkl'd with the Poi&s;on, as they call it; and taking the Honey out by Handfuls I eat it before them, asking them if they would partake with me? They &s;aid, they would not touch it for a thou&s;and Cattle, making &s;everal Grimaces in the mean time, and dreading what would befa&punc; me for my Pre&s;umption. When I had fill'd my Belly, and cloy'd my&s;elf, my Ma&s;ter would have me Home with him to be ready to have it
<PB N="122" REF="141">
expell'd, but I cho&s;e rather to go to Play with my Comrades; by which Means I had Time to think of &s;ome Way to deceive them. As Luck would have it, being in the Fields, I e&s;py'd a Calf &s;ucking a Cow, and No-body in View; &s;o I ty'd up the Calf with my Lam|ber, and milk'd the Cow into my Mouth as long as the Cow would give Milk; this, and the Honey together had the de&s;ir'd Effect; for it began to &s;well me, and rumble in my Belly that it might be heard. Away I went to my Comrades, who &s;eeing my Belly &s;well'd, and hearing the rumbling, advis'd me to run Home; and cry'd out I was poi&s;on'd. I pre|tended to &s;tep behind a Hedge on &s;ome Oc|&s;ion, but it was only to beat my&s;elf with Nettles; the Pimples and Redne&s;s rais'd from this did the more affright them; for there appear'd on me all the Signs and Symptoms of Poi&s;on, which the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee</HI> had before de|&s;crib'd; and to compleat the Deceit, you may be &s;ure, I did not fail heavily to complain, and cry out; hereupon &s;ome ran before me, and others help'd me Home.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter had prepar'd the Water with the <HI>Vauhovalumy,</HI> or Root of Life; the Peo|ple, terrify'd at the Danger I was in, flock'd to the Hou&s;e; pitying me, and admiring the great Learning of the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee;</HI> who did not him&s;elf perceive the Cheat. Well, I
<PB N="123" REF="142">
drank the Medicine, and after lying down three or four Hours all was vani&s;h'd, and I was well; the <HI>Vauhovalumy</HI> was e&s;teem'd a great Medicine, the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee</HI> a very great and wi&s;e Man, and did not a little value him&s;elf upon it; repenting that he had parted with the Secret &s;o cheap, &s;aying, <HI>He would have twenty Cows for it of the next who wanted it. Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> to gratify him, bid him choo&s;e his two Cows and two Calves out of all his Cattle in the Cow-pen; which he did, and departed. My Ma&s;ter, on my Promi&s;e of Secrecy, di&s;clos'd both the Roots to me, and the Manner of finding and u&s;ing them; for the Pain I had &s;uffer'd, and the Hazard, he believ'd, I underwent, he gave me a Cow and a Calf; I then thought I had made a very good Day's Work.</P>
<P>WHEN I return'd to my Plantation, my Neighbours, and Fellow-Slaves having &s;een the terrible Effects of this Poi&s;on, de&s;ir'd me to put a Mark on all my Hives; that when they went out a Honey-thieving they might not be kill'd, by happening on any of mine. This was the Thing I aim'd at, and according|ly I put a white Stick before every Hive, and never after this lo&s;t my Honey: No-body would go near my Hives, for Fear my Bees &s;hould &s;ting them, and their Stings be of more dangerous Con&s;equence than tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="143">
I, having now a Cow and Calf, had Milk of my own, and was as rich as my Fellow-Slaves; be&s;ides the Gain I made of my Ho|ney, by &s;elling forty or fifty Gallons a Year, to other People for <HI>Hatchets, Beads,</HI> &amp;c. who make <HI>Toak</HI> with it; more e&s;pecially again&s;t their <HI>Circumci&s;ion,</HI> and other Fea&s;ts.</P>
<P>I liv'd thus about three Years, which, with two Years and a half before, made almo&s;t an Ap|prentice&s;hip in this Country: My Ma&s;ter came one Day to &s;ee how we went on, and taking more than ordinary Notice of my Manner of working, he at length told me I mu&s;t go Home with him, and keep his Cattle, which were near the Town. This was much le&s;s Work than digging, and cultivating his Plantation; however I was pretty well reconcil'd to it, &s;ince my own Plantation was likewi&s;e &s;o much im|prov'd; but he providing for me now, and my Honey being &s;afe, I was not much con|cern'd at my Removal: So away I went, dri|ving my own Cattle, which were now en|creas'd, having a Cow and Calf, be&s;ides two Heifers. My Hou&s;hold-Furniture too was not &s;o much, but I was able to carry it away my|&s;elf at once; yet I was as rich, and had as much as other People of my Condition, and more than many of them.</P>
<P>I built me an Hou&s;e, and a Cow-pen for my own Cattle in le&s;s than two Days: Now
<PB N="125" REF="144">
was I in my fir&s;t Station again, looking after Cattle; the harde&s;t of my Labour was (as I &s;aid before) every other Night bringing Home either a Tub, or a Callaba&s;h four or five Miles full of Water; but con&s;idering I was a Slave, it was as ea&s;y living as I could expect.</P>
<P>I had not continu'd long in this la&s;t Sta|tion, before a common Calamity reduc'd us to mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances: The epidemical Evil of this I&s;land is, Their <HI>Frequent Quar|rels with one another;</HI> and the very Cau&s;e &s;o many of them are &s;old to the <HI>Europeans</HI> for Slaves. This is a dangerous and de&s;truc|tive Misfortune to a People, otherwi&s;e good natur'd and well inclin'd, who have whol|&s;ome &s;tated Laws for determining Di&s;putes, and puni&s;hing Crimes; of which I &s;hall give an Account in a proper Place: But what I have ob&s;erv'd is, that the &s;upreme King of any Country has &s;eldom Force enough, to bring the le&s;&s;er Chiefs in his Dominions to an&s;wer, in a judicial Manner, to the Wrongs they do one another, or the Mi&s;takes and Errors committed by Chance; but they fight it out, making Slaves of, impoveri&s;hing, and de&s;troying one another, after the Manner I am now going to relate; in which I my&s;elf was a grievous Sufferer.</P>
<P>EVERY Thing &s;eem'd happy, and peace|able: No foreign Enemy for a long Time
<PB N="126" REF="145">
di&s;turb'd us. But what I took Notice of, when fir&s;t a Slave, was my Ma&s;ter's, and others &s;tealing their Neighbours Cattle, and their Neighbours doing al&s;o the &s;ame by them; for they were equally addicted to this Kind of Thievery: So that it could not ea&s;ily be known, who was the Ag|gre&s;&s;or in the pre&s;ent Quarrel. But one Day, when I, and &s;ome others went about five or &s;ix Miles to water our Cattle, hav|ing two Men arm'd with Guns to guard us as u&s;ual, it happen'd in our going Home, that, tho' the greater Number of them went on &s;lowly, grazing as they pa&s;s'd a|long, &s;ome of the Milch-Cows ran home|ward before the re&s;t; wanting to be &s;uck'd by their Calves. The Men, knowing me to be light of Foot, de&s;ir'd me to run after and &s;top them, that they might be kept in a Body; but they being got a great Way off, it was &s;ome Time before I could &s;top them. When I turn'd about, I was &s;ur|pris'd to &s;ee one of our Men &s;hooting in|to a Body of Men, who drove the Cattle a contrary Way; and running from them toward me, they &s;oon e&s;py'd me, and the Cattle with me, and ran after us. Here|upon I left the Cattle, and fled, as fa&s;t as I could, Home to my Ma&s;ter, and got there the fir&s;t of any Body; puffing, and blow|ing,
<PB N="127" REF="146">
being frighten'd and out of Breath, in imperfect Exclamations I told him, an Army had taken our Cattle; and one of our Men, named <HI>Roy'n&s;owra,</HI> had fir'd, and kill'd a Man; but I could not tell him who the Ene|my were, nor on what Account they did it. While my Ma&s;ter and the re&s;t were talking with me, in came two or three more; who &s;aid it was <HI>Deaan Chahary</HI> and his Brother <HI>Deaan Frukey,</HI> two of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Sons. It &s;eems, our Ma&s;ter had been di&s;cover'd &s;tealing three of <HI>Deaan Frukey</HI>'s Cattle; and this they did out of Revenge. All was in Confu&s;ion and Hurry at once; every Man taking his Arms, <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> bid them follow him, which they were as ready to do as him&s;elf to lead; for it was a gene|ral Lo&s;s. All the Milch Cows, and Home|kept Cattle were gone, and now away go all the Men in Per&s;uit of them; except &s;ome old and incapable Per&s;ons. Among&s;t others I was broke too, having lo&s;t my Cow and Heifers; my Calf, indeed, was left at Home, bellowing for its Dam, as did every Body's el&s;e; between whom, and the crying of the Women and Children, there was a mo&s;t confu&s;ed, and frightful Uproar.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Frukey,</HI> who then was (or pre|tended to be) the injur'd Per&s;on, liv'd with|in
<PB N="128" REF="147">
two, or three Miles of our Watering-place; but they drove our Cattle a great Way more to the Northward to <HI>Deaan Cha|hary</HI>'s Town, which was better - fortify'd, and more capable of being defended from the A&s;&s;ault, which, they ju&s;tly expected, we &s;hould make again&s;t it. Our People, notwith&s;tanding the Pa&s;&s;ion they were in, and the Speed they made, yet follow'd them with great Circum&s;pection; having Spies running &s;oftly before, by whom they found their Enemies were enter'd the Town with their Booty. Our People, not being provi|ded with Strength enough, and having no Time to call in the Help of their Neighbours, did not attempt to a&s;&s;ault <HI>Deaan Chahary</HI>'s Town; but &s;ilently and undi&s;cover'd turn'd off, and went about five Miles further; where they kept all their breeding Cattle. The&s;e they took, it being now late in the Night; the few Keepers they had were at a Di&s;tance and fa&s;t a&s;leep, knowing nothing of the Matter; &s;o they drove away the Bea&s;ts without any Noi&s;e, and came home|wards as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. We look'd out all the Morning, expecting them every Mi|nute to return; at length we e&s;py'd them with a va&s;t large Drove of Cattle, con|taining as many, or more than our own; being above five hundred. We all thought
<PB N="129" REF="148">
they had recover'd their own; and I more e&s;pecially was thinking, how I &s;hould ki&s;s my Cow for Joy of &s;eeing her again; but we &s;oon perceiv'd they were Strangers, and I, not be|ing with them, had no Share in the Booty.</P>
<P>MY Ma&s;ter, and &s;everal others, after they had divided them, kill'd &s;ome Oxen; we made a jovial Fea&s;t, and &s;ome of our People &s;ent me Pre&s;ents of Meat. The next Day my Ma|&s;ter &s;ent me away to look after the Cattle as before; and him&s;elf went to repair &s;ome Breaches in his Town-Walls, by putting in Poles cut down on Purpo&s;e, and made Prepa|rations for a War. But he had not Patience to &s;tay at Home, and &s;ee if his Enemies would come to give him any new Di&s;tur|bance; tho' the Reprizals he had made on them might have well contented him, being more than he lo&s;t; nothing would &s;erve him, but in two or three Days Time he would go, and &s;urprize his Enemies Town by Night, and left his own unguarded, and had ju&s;t &s;uch Suc|ce&s;s as &s;o precipitate a Conduct de&s;erv'd: For the very Morning after they went on their Expedition, as I, and others were watering the Cattle, and carefully regarding them, le&s;t they &s;hould run towards their own Home, which was nearer than our Town to the Wa|tering-place; about twenty Men ru&s;h'd out of a Thicket of Bu&s;hes, and leap'd upon us
<PB N="130" REF="149">
like &s;o many Tigers at their Prey. I, and three or four Boys had Time to &s;tart out of their Clutches, and run for it; but they &s;oon came up with the re&s;t, carrying them back, and all the Cattle and other Slaves who were with them; while &s;ome follow'd me, hollowing, yelping, and threatning they would kill me, if I did not &s;top, and yield my&s;elf their Captive; but turning about, and perceiving I gain'd Ground of them, I ran on for a Mile and half at lea&s;t, before I came to any Place to &s;helter my&s;elf; at length, I got to a Wood, which I knew, where I &s;oon lo&s;t them; and they re|turn'd back to their Companions, who march'd off with their Pri&s;oners and Cattle. I, perceiv|ing them gone, ha&s;ted home; when I enter'd the Town, the Women immediately flock'd about me; for they &s;aw by my Countenance, and the Confu&s;ion I was in, that &s;ome Evil had hap|pen'd: I &s;oon made them &s;en&s;ible of the Lo&s;s, and they as &s;oon reflected on their Husbands ill Conduct; who, to follow the Dictates of a blind Pa&s;&s;ion, and revenge them&s;elves on their Ene|mies, would leave all that was valuable to them|&s;elves unguarded, to become a Prey to tho&s;e very Enemies; who, they might be &s;ure, had Spies out to give Notice of every Opportu|nity, which might be of Advantage to them.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> return'd about Evening, when, for his Welcome-home, the News of
<PB N="131" REF="150">
this, which happen'd at Sun-ri&s;ing, was told him. I al&s;o under&s;tood, the Expedition they went on had been fruitle&s;s; for tho' they arriv'd at their Enemies Town an Hour be|fore Day-light, yet &s;o vigilant were they, in &s;ending out Spies every Way Night and Day&punc; that they di&s;cover'd our People, and alarm'd the Towns-folks; who came out and met them: And all that was done, as I could hear, was only &s;colding at one another, like Wo|men, with a <HI>You began fir&s;t,</HI> and <HI>You gave the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> began to fire a little at them at a Di&s;tance, and they return'd it; but without Execution on either Side. A Kin&s;man coming &s;oon after Day-light to <HI>Deaan Frukey</HI>'s A&s;&s;i&s;tance, <HI>Deaan Me|varrow</HI> thought be&s;t to retire; but not with|out telling them, <Q>&startq;If his Kin&s;man, and his People had not come, he would have had all his Cattle again in a few Hours.&endq;</Q> To which they an&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;That they would not only keep his Cattle, but that their own, which he had lately carry'd away by Sur|prize, were by this Time in their own Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion again, as he would find at his Re|turn Home;&endq;</Q> and &s;o in Truth he found it. At which he was heartily vex'd, but we had kill'd a pretty many of them fir&s;t, and &s;tock'd our&s;elves with Provi&s;ion. He vow'd Revenge on his Uncles, and accordingly provides for
<PB N="132" REF="151">
another Enterprize; which they &s;et out up|on in three Days after. He ask'd me, if I was willing to go with them, I very readily embrac'd the Offer; for there was Safety no where now, and it was as little Danger with them as at Home: So he furni&s;h'd me with a Gun, Cartouch-box, and Powder-horn, &amp;c. and I commenc'd Souldier.</P>
<P>WE &s;ally'd out of our Town ju&s;t as it was dark, for we had a great Way to go: <HI>Deaan Frukey,</HI> with all his People, having de&s;erted their own Town as not defen&s;ible, and mov'd to his Brother's, which was many Miles fur|ther to the Northward. We march'd very &s;wiftly, but &s;ilently; never &s;peaking to one another, but in Whi&s;pers. My Skin appear|ing white, they thought it might be &s;een at a Di&s;tance in the dark, and thereby di&s;cover us to our Enemies Spies; they, therefore, made me daub my&s;elf all over with Mud.</P>
<P>WE arriv'd two Hours before Day near the Town, and &s;ent two Men, who knew it well, to go round it, and &s;earch for Breaches, or weak Places in the Fortifications: They return'd, having di&s;cover'd two Breaches; as al&s;o the private Way, which is always pro|vided for the Women and Children to e&s;cape to the Woods by, in Ca&s;e of a Surprize. Near this Place we laid an Ambu&s;cade of thirty Men, who were not to fire, or make any Noi&s;e,
<PB N="133" REF="152">
only to &s;eize the Women in their Flight. Our Army was divided in three Parts: <HI>Deaan Me|varrow</HI> with his, attack'd the mo&s;t difficult Breach of the two in the Walls, a Chief Man of his the other, and <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> the Gate, in who&s;e Party I was; for my Ma&s;ter would not take me with him, thinking I could not well bear to tread on the Thorns in the For|tification.</P>
<P>THERE were three Gates, one within ano|ther: The Signal for us to attack was the fi|ring the fir&s;t Gun; which was when <HI>Deaan Me|varrow,</HI> and the other Chief had &s;ecur'd the out-&s;ide of the Breaches: It was a Quarter of an Hour we waited in Expectation before the Gun was fir'd; the Towns-men were immediately in Arms, and almo&s;t as ready as we; for they &s;ecur'd the inner Gate, at the Time when we enter'd the outer, and came furiou&s;ly on to|wards us; but we drove them back. How|ever they maintain'd the other a long Time, till <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> had, with much Difficul|ty, enter'd thorow the Breach; he had one of his principal Men &s;hot in the Belly ju&s;t be|fore him; which &s;o enrag'd him that he leap'd down, and the re&s;t follow'd. About the &s;ame Time we pu&s;h'd vigorou&s;ly tho&s;e we engag'd with, enter'd the Town, and immediately heard the Outcry of the Women, who were &s;urpris'd by our Ambu&s;cade, and almo&s;t all taken. The
<PB N="134" REF="153">
Men got off, by a Breach of their own making, into the Woods, and left us the Town to plunder and burn; which we did not fail to do. I got &s;ome Cotton, wooden Platters and Spoons. We found here a great many of our Cattle, and looking about, I e&s;py'd my Cow, and now thought my&s;elf &s;ure of her; but &s;ee the ill Effects of too great Security, we had now a great Booty of Slaves and Cattle; the latter we drove out of the Town before us, neglecting to &s;ecure them with a Guard before them, thinking we had entirely defeated, and di&s;|pers'd all our Enemies; when in Truth, they were encreas'd, and kept in a Body in the Woods, ob&s;erving our Motions, and watching an Opportunity for their Advantage. They &s;oon perceiv'd the Cattle defencele&s;s, and had nothing to do, but to turn them out of the Way we put them into, and drive them a little into the Woods; where we lo&s;t them all again, as &s;oon as we had got them: For marching to regain them, our Enemy appear'd in a formidable Body, firing at us, and even offering us Battle. Here they kill'd us one Man: We had mi&s;s'd &s;everal of our People before, while we were in the Town; and &s;earching about, found three of them wounded, and four of our principal, and &s;toute&s;t Men kill'd. This very much afflicted <HI>Deaan Me|varrow,</HI> and all the re&s;t, and abated their Cou|rage;
<PB N="135" REF="154" MS="Y">
&s;o that they thought of nothing, but retiring with the Slaves they had taken, and getting out of the Reach of their Enemy as fa&s;t as they could. Accordingly they left the plain open Road we came by, and went thorow the Woods, a mo&s;t wretched Way for ten Miles or more, full of Thorns and Briars, and per|petually in Fear of Ambu&s;cades. However, we &s;topp'd to make a Bier, to carry our wounded Men upon, and then march'd on, but with great Circum&s;pection, thinking every Bird which &s;tir'd, an Enemy in Ambu&s;cade. After we were thorow this long Wood, we &s;till went by unpractis'd Ways; &s;o that it was ju&s;t dark as we got Home. It is cu&s;tomary, let the Succe&s;s be good or bad, for the Chief to &s;et down with his People before his own Hou&s;e; the Women &s;oon flock'd about him to know the News; and notwith&s;tanding the Prize of Slaves we brought with us, here was but a melancholy Scene; for the Wives, Re|lations, and Friends of the Men who were kill'd, made great Lamentation. However, &s;ome Calves were kill'd, and we refre&s;h'd our|&s;elves after our Fatigue, as well as we could, every Man at his own Home, and being wea|ry, laid down to &s;leep; but before Day-light we were waken'd by the Firing of a Gun. Our Enemies, by our Conduct the Day be|fore, found we were di&s;pirited, and re&s;olv'd

to give us no Time to recruit; &s;o they fol|low'd us, and attack'd our Town, as we had done theirs; but I think, they did not be|have with &s;o much Judgment and good Conduct as we did at their Town: For the fir&s;t Thing we did on the Alarm, was to order a Party to &s;ecure the Wives, Children, and valuable Slaves; in which we &s;ucceeded happily, and convey'd them &s;afe out of the Town to their Hiding-place. We defended our&s;elves as long as we could, but not with &s;o much Re&s;olu|tion as we &s;hould have done at another Time; yet we retir'd with little Lo&s;s, and left them the Town to plunder, as we had done theirs. There was very little of Value for them, the Women carrying off what their Ha&s;te would admit of; and as for Cattle, there was none but a few Calves, who&s;e Dams they had feiz'd at fir&s;t; and they were in &s;o much Ha&s;te, that they could not drive them away; &s;o they kill'd them, and carry'd as much of their Carca&s;es away for Food, as they could con|veniently. They never attempted to go in Search for the Women, but they call'd; and told us, <Q>&startq;We &s;hould have no Re&s;t, till they had their Wives and Children again.&endq;</Q> We told them, <Q>&startq;We would have our Cattle a|gain, and keep their Wives too.&endq;</Q> They &s;eem'd pleas'd with this Revenge on us, and it was no &s;mall Satisfaction to our People,

tho' they were defeated this Time, to find, that notwith&s;tanding the Di&s;advantage they took us at, we were, at lea&s;t, their Match.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> our King, had by this Time the News carry'd him; who immedi|ately undertook to reconcile us, and accord|ingly &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to both Parties, to know the Cau&s;e of the Quarrel, and the Demands on each Side. <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> &s;ent Word he was ready to oblige the King, and would live in Peace with his Uncles, if they would &s;end him all his Cattle again; and <HI>Deaan Fru|key,</HI> and <HI>Chahary</HI> wanted their Wives again, and &s;aid, They would return what Cattle was left alive of ours; but they had kill'd a third Part, and refus'd to make up the Number; &s;o that the King could not per&s;uade <HI>Deaan Frukey,</HI> to make up the Number of our Cattle; nor us to &s;end them their Wives without them. Our Ma&s;ter &s;ent the King Word, that <Q>&startq;&endq;All the Force he had, join'd with his Sons, &s;hould not oblige him to re&s;tore their Wives and Children on other Terms.</Q></P>
<P>THESE haughty An&s;wers <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> re|&s;ented, and was re&s;olv'd, by Force, to reduce them to a Compliance; and in Order there|to, mu&s;ters an Army of a thou&s;and Men, and de&s;ign'd to come to <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> fir&s;t. Now <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> could not, on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, rai&s;e a great Army, becau&s;e there was a Di&s;pute

always &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and his Ne|phew <HI>Murnanzack,</HI> who&s;e Father was <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s elder Brother; who dying when his Son was young, and his Country invaded by an Enemy, this Uncle took on him the Charge of the Government; and when po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it, would never lay it down. <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> was not only a gallant Man in War, but al&s;o of as fine Accompli&s;hments as this illiterate Country could produce, as we &s;hall &s;ee here|after. He was ju&s;t, honourable, and exceed|ing generous and affable; he had three Bro|thers, who were Lords, Judges, and Chiefs of Towns, who together could make up an Army not much inferior to their Uncle's; be&s;ides he was very much e&s;teem'd, and belov'd all over the Country. Now in Ca&s;e of a foreign War, they all readily join'd to oppo&s;e the common Enemy of their Country, as we have &s;een them do again&s;t the Kings of <HI>Merfaughla</HI> and <HI>Anteno&s;a;</HI> but among&s;t them&s;elves they always regarded each other with jealous and watch|ful Eyes; therefore <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> could bring no greater an Army again&s;t us, than was con|&s;i&s;tent with the Safety of his own, and his Sons Towns.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> had Notice of this De&s;ign again&s;t him, by a Friend of his in <HI>Fenno-arevo,</HI> who ran from thence to our Town by Night and was back again before Day-light undi&s;|cover'd.
<PB N="139" REF="158">
My Ma&s;ter had a Cou&s;in, with whom he had an intimate Friend&s;hip, and who&s;e Fa|ther was as potent a Lord as any in <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Dominions; to this Uncle, who&s;e Name was <HI>Mephontey,</HI> did he fly, with his People, for Protection. We &s;oon pack'd up our (little) ALL, which we &s;av'd from our Ene|mies. My whole Stock of Provi&s;ion and Hou&s;|hold-Furniture worth carrying away, was a|bout a Gallon of Carravances, a Mat to lye on, a Hatchet, and little Spade to dig wild Yams. We wanted no Hoes now, that Work was at a Stop in this Country. All our Plan|tations, and mo&s;t of the Produce, laid up in little Store-hou&s;es, we now left to our Ene|mies; or whom&s;oever had a Mind to do as they pleas'd with them. In half a Day we arriv'd at <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI>'s Town, who treated my Ma&s;ter with great Civility, and a&s;&s;ur'd him of his Protection; and that he would de|fend him, and his People to the la&s;t Extre|mity. The Chiefs had Hou&s;es given them, and we common People built for our&s;elves in any Part of the Town, where we could find Room; I made a very &s;mall and &s;light One &s;erve my Turn, for I did not know how &s;oon it might be burnt.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was with us in three Days Time, and encamp'd before the Town: He &s;ent to <HI>Deaan Mephontey,</HI> de&s;iring him, <Q>&startq;&endq;To

deliver up <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> and all his Peo|ple;</Q> and bid him detain them at his Peril. To which <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI> &s;ent a re&s;olute An|&s;wer, <Q>&startq;&endq;That he would protect any Strangers, who were good People, and fled to him for Relief when they were in Di&s;tre&s;s, much more would he do for Friends and Rela|lations; and if <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> would have them, he mu&s;t get them by Force; for he would defend them to the utmo&s;t of his Power.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> made Preparation to attack the Town the next Morning, and we to defend it: And in Order thereunto, the Women and Chil|dren were &s;ent away in the dark to the Woods; not all into one Place, but at Di&s;tances in &s;mall Companies. I was order'd with a Guard to &s;ee my Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;afe, and &s;ome other Women and Slaves with her, which I did; and after mark|ing the Place to find it again, I return'd to the Town, where we liv'd well that Night, dre&s;&s;ing and eating Beef, &amp;c. for we had &s;ome Cattle of our own, &s;uch as I was &s;ent to keep at fir&s;t, breeding Cows, Heifers, and Oxen; which were a great Way off, when <HI>Deaan Frukey</HI> &s;eiz'd tbe Milch Cows; but we wanted Wa|ter, which was a great Misfortune to us; our Enemies being &s;o near, we could fetch none all the Day before.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="160">
THE next Morning we were all up by Break of Day, and every Man at his Station, as it was appointed the Day before; mine was be|hind my Ma&s;ter, who had two Guns; one of which I was to keep and load, while he fir'd with the other. It was broad Day before our Enemies began the Attack, they fir'd &s;o brisk|ly upon us, that for almo&s;t a Quarter of an Hour we could not &s;ee them for Smoak; but when their Fire abated a little, we return'd it as hotly upon them. On the &s;econd On&s;et they came nearer to us, and the Lances began now to fly at one another; one of which went thorow my Lamber, and &s;cratch'd me; I was a little &s;car'd at fir&s;t, but &s;oon recovering my Spirits, I return'd them the Lance over the Fortification, in the &s;ame Manner it came to me. The Cattle were very trouble&s;ome to us; &s;everal being wounded, ran up and down and di&s;order'd the re&s;t, like &s;o many wild Bulls. We fought thus for four Hours, with great Fury on both Sides; till <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> finding he could not enter the Town, call'd off his Forces, and retreated to his Camp. <HI>Deaan Mephontey,</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> were for &s;allying out, but <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI>'s Son <HI>Batoengha,</HI> with &s;ome Difficulty, per&s;uaded them again&s;t it, &s;u&s;pecting an Ambu&s;cade. We had &s;everal People kill'd on both Sides, and &s;ome wounded, whom we convey'd out of the
<PB N="142" REF="161">
Town, after the Fight, to their Wives. We bury'd the dead under the Fortification, and &s;ent out Spies to ob&s;erve the Enemy, who brought us Intelligence they were very quiet, regarding nothing but killing Cattle, and fetch|ing Wood to dre&s;s their Meat. When this In|telligence was repeated, and we were &s;uffici|ently a&s;&s;ur'd, they would give us no more Trouble that Day, our People kill'd, and dre&s;s'd Beef al&s;o; but we were parch'd up with Thir&s;t: You might here have &s;een Men, with their Tongues hanging out of their Mouths thro' exce&s;&s;ive Heat. This Want of Water is the mo&s;t intolerable of all Calamities, a painful Mi&s;ery not to be expre&s;s'd in Words. It may be remember'd, that when I fir&s;t came into this Country, I had felt the Angui&s;h for al|mo&s;t four Days, and know by dear Expe|rience, that Hunger is not to be compar'd to Thir&s;t; but I had Relief &s;ooner than my Neighbours, for my Ma&s;ter &s;ent me, and two Slaves out of the Town, with Provi&s;ions for our Mi&s;tre&s;s, and tho&s;e with her$; where, by the Way, we found a little Water.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome Difficulty to find the Place, where I left her the Night before; however, at length we came to them, whom we found in great Concern for our Welfare: My Mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;itting on her Legs crying, for hearing the Guns firing, and, at length, cea&s;ing all at
<PB N="143" REF="162">
once, &s;he thought the Town was taken, and her Husband kill'd; but the Sight of us di&s;|&s;ipated all her Fears. I cut down &s;ome Boughs of Trees with large Leaves, which &s;erv'd very well for Di&s;hes and Plates, and cutting the roa&s;t Meat, I brought on my Back, into Pieces, I &s;erv'd it up to my Mi&s;tre&s;s. I don't que|&s;tion, but &s;ome will remark, that &s;he had not &s;o much Delicacy, as we &s;ee in fine Ladies of her high Rank and Di&s;tinction in <HI>Europe,</HI> yet I dare &s;ay, &s;he enjoy'd as good a Repa&s;t, and as much to her Satisfaction, as any of them would have done in her Circum&s;tances. When I had &s;erv'd her, I divided the re&s;t among my Fellow-Servants, her Women, who accompa|ny'd her; and my Orders being to &s;tay with her, I &s;ent the two Men away; they had brought a good deal of raw Meat, and in the Night I could make a Fire to dre&s;s it, which could not be &s;een at any great Di&s;tance tho|row &s;o thick a Wood, when in the Day-time the Smoak might have di&s;cover'd us. I went at a Di&s;tance, and dug wild Yams, which were very acceptable for their Moi&s;ture, this Place being de&s;titute of Water; but as much as they wanted them, they would not venture to dig for them&s;elves till licame, le&s;t the Noi&s;e might betray them to the Enemy.</P>
<P>AT Night we &s;at very &s;ocially round the Fire, while I entertain'd them with the Story
<PB N="144" REF="163">
of the Fight, and my own Danger. I al&s;o roa&s;ted my Meat, and hung it up in Trees, out of the Reach of wild Dogs and Foxes. When it was Time to go to Sleep, I told them I had no Bed, having forgot my Mat in the Hurry. They laugh'd at me for this, and my Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;aid, <HI>Sure you don't doubt, but we will make Room for one Man among&s;t us;</HI> and bid me <HI>choo&s;e my Place.</HI> Now I might be free enough with the young Women-Slaves, tho' not with her&s;elf; &s;o we lay down very clo&s;e together all Night, but very innocently.</P>
<P>I had formerly wonder'd, why my Ma&s;ter made no Scruple of tru&s;ting me with his Wife, contrary to his Care of her in re&s;pect to other Men, and to the Cu&s;tom of the Country; but when I began to con&s;ider, how hazardous it was for any Woman, who was liable to be call'd to an Account for her Actions, to have an Affair with a white Man, the Wonder ceas'd; for if a Woman &s;hould prove with Child, the Colour of the Off-&s;pring would de|clare the Father. But I mu&s;t not let this pa&s;s with any Thing which may be taken as a Hint to this Lady's Prejudice; for I &s;incerely declare, I never once di&s;cover'd in her any criminal Inclinations; notwith&s;tanding what may be &s;aid here, or el&s;ewhere, of &s;ome &s;uch Liberties, which would not look well in <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> Women.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="164">
WE aro&s;e by Day-break, and li&s;ten'd very diligently for the Noi&s;e of Guns, but heard none; and in a little While the two Men came again to us, and brought us more Meat. They told us, that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> had &s;ent a threat|ning Me&s;&s;age to <HI>Deaan Mephontey,</HI> to tell him, <Q>&startq;That if he did not oblige <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> to come out to him, and &s;ubmit to his De|ci&s;ion of the Quarrel between him and <HI>Deaan Frukey,</HI> that he would humble their haughty Spirits by Force; for he would there re|main with his Army till he &s;tarv'd them, and al&s;o guard the Watering-place, that they &s;hould not come at it.&endq;</Q> <HI>Deaan Me|phontey</HI> return'd as re&s;olute an An&s;wer, <Q>&startq;&endq;That he did not fear &s;tarving, having Provi&s;ions enough of all Sorts; a great Number of Cattle, and Hou&s;es enough for them to live on for three Months; be&s;ides which, he had Strength &s;ufficient to force his Way out of the Town whenever he had a Mind; and, therefore, advis'd <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> not to put it to the Hazard of a Trial; but to depart contented with the Repul&s;e he had already met with.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER the Men had told all they had to &s;ay, they return'd home, and we all went to digging of Yams; even my Mi&s;tre&s;s too would make one among&s;t us: So I &s;harpen'd Sticks for them, and they pull'd off their Lambers,
<PB N="146" REF="165">
becau&s;e they would not dirty them; &s;ome of which a Rag - Woman in <HI>England</HI> would &s;carce have taken up. My Mi&s;tre&s;s's, indeed, was a fine &s;ilk One of divers Colours, and very large, hanging almo&s;t down to her Feet, and a Fringe at the Bottom. They took more Li|berties with me than they would with others' laughing and &s;aying, they did not regard me as a Man; &s;eeing I di&s;cover'd no manly Inclina|tions. My Reader, perhaps, will &s;carce credit it, but this was my Behaviour and my Re&s;o|lution at that Time, and long after; and I told them, <HI>That I would not till I return'd to</HI> England. They &s;aid, <HI>They were &s;ure that would never be.</HI> I liv'd very idly, and merrily, the few Days I remain'd here; there were about a Dozen of them, be&s;ides my Mi&s;tre&s;s: And, indeed, I did not care how long the War la&s;ted; for it was ea&s;y living, my Provi&s;ion being given me all the Time, and no Work to do. As to the Ha|zard of the War, I did not trouble my&s;elf about it; I had nothing to lo&s;e but my Life, and that I did not much regard in the Circum|&s;tances I was in, and the De&s;pair of ever get|ting Home; but we had not yet &s;een all the Mi&s;eries of a Civil War.</P>
<P>EVERY Morning we us'd to li&s;ten very at|tentively for the Noi&s;e of Guns; when at length came one o&s; the Slaves alone without Meat; and having &s;eated him&s;elf (as is always the
<PB N="147" REF="166">
Cu&s;tom of every Body, Slaves more e&s;pecially&punc; before they &s;peak;) he then told us, <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was gone, and my Ma&s;ter had &s;ent for us Home. This was joyful News, we &s;at down to Breakfa&s;t together, &s;ung, and were as merry as &s;o many Beggars. My Mi&s;tre&s;s ha&s;ten'd to be gone, for &s;he was unea&s;y till &s;he came to her Husband, whom &s;he no &s;ooner &s;aw, than &s;he fell on her Knees, and lick'd his Feet; and he &s;aluted her after the Manner of the Country; which is, by touching their No&s;es together.</P>
<P>Now the Rea&s;on of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s &s;udden Departure was, on his hearing that <HI>Deaan Mur|nanzack</HI> had &s;eiz'd &s;ix hundred of his Cattle; he might have taken them all, but he did this only to begin the Di&s;pute. We &s;tay'd, never|thele&s;s, a Week longer at <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI>'s Town, till we were well inform'd how the Matter &s;tood between them; and that we were &s;ure, we had no more to fear on that Side. <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> we were told, had &s;ent to <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> to know on what Account he &s;eiz'd tho&s;e Cattle; and whether he meant to take <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s Part? and receiv'd for An|&s;wer, <Q>&startq;&endq;That he did it to begin his Claim on him for his Right of Dominion; and which he &s;uppos'd, and expected he would as un|ju&s;tly di&s;pute with him, as he had unju&s;tly u&s;urp'd it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="167">
THIS was a mortifying Stroke, and hap|pen'd at an unlucky Juncture: <HI>Deaan Mur|nanzack</HI> was always a formidable Competitor, and was look'd on as &s;uch, whenever he &s;hould think proper to a&s;&s;ert his Right; and he cho&s;e this Opportunity (no Doubt) on Purpo&s;e, when <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> had weaken'd him&s;elf, by affronting <HI>Deaan Mevarrow, Deaan Sambo,</HI> and their Friend <HI>Deaan Mephontey. Crindo</HI> was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of his Error, and endeavour'd to &s;often Matters, by &s;ending Me&s;&s;engers to them all, to tell them, <Q>&startq;&endq;That what he had done was only to correct his Grand&s;ons; and what was nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore the Peace of the Country, which they, and his Son <HI>Fru|key</HI> had violated; and tho' he began with the former, yet <HI>Frukey</HI> had far'd no better, if he had prov'd refractory; he, therefore, hop'd they would con&s;ider his good Inten|tion,</Q> and not break Friend&s;hip with him.</P>
<P>THREE or Four Days after this, we de|parted from <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI>'s, not without returning many Thanks for the&s;e great De|mon&s;trations of Friend&s;hip, and Ho&s;pitality. We went Home, (homeward I &s;hould &s;ay) for the Way we found, and the Place of our late Aboad; but not a Hou&s;e left to put our Heads in. Our Plantations too were de&s;troy'd, and the very Barns and Store-hou&s;es burnt; &s;o that we had nothing to live on, but what
<PB N="149" REF="168">
the Woods afforded, and a few Cattle among the riche&s;t and chiefe&s;t Men; who were, in Truth, very good, and communicated to their poor Neighbours.</P>
<P>THE Town being &s;o utterly de&s;troy'd, as not to be repair'd, <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> re&s;olv'd to build a new One; and going about to look for a proper Place, at length, a Wood was found &s;o thick, that a Dog could not creep into it. This, therefore, was more than half fortify'd; &s;o all Hands went to Work to make a Vacancy in it; the Men cut down the Trees, Bu&s;hes and Briars, and the Women and Children dragg'd them away; &s;o that in three Days, we clear'd a pretty large Space to build our Hou&s;es in: But it was Summer|time, and we were not in &s;o much Ha&s;te for Hou&s;es, as for Defences again&s;t an Enemy. We, therefore, &s;et about fortifying it with Bodies of Trees, which we cut about &s;ixteen or eighteen Foot long; the&s;e we &s;tuck into the Ground &s;o clo&s;e together, that no Creature could get between them. We thought our|&s;elves not &s;ecure enough with one Row only of the&s;e Poles or Trees; but we made three or four one within another, round the whole Space of the Town; leaving no Vacancy, only a &s;mall and private Pa&s;&s;age for conveying the Women, Children, and Slaves thorow, in Ca&s;e of an Enemy's Approach; and this was &s;o
<PB N="150" REF="169">
contriv'd, as not ea&s;ily to be &s;een, or known by Strangers. We made only one Gate|way, or Entrance, which was narrow too, and defended with four prodigious thick and &s;trong Doors, one within another.</P>
<P>THE Walls being fini&s;h'd, we had nothing now to do, but every Man to build a Hou&s;e for him&s;elf and Family. We, who were Slaves to <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> went all Hands to work to build his fir&s;t; &s;ome cut Wood, others fetch'd Gra&s;s to fill up the Sides with; while I, and about thirty more, went a long Way, I dare &s;ay, ten or twelve Miles for <HI>Annevoes,</HI> which are the Leaves of a Tree like a <HI>Coco|nut</HI> Tree; the&s;e we &s;plit, and cover the Hou&s;e with at the Top; it makes a Thatch hand|&s;omer, and &s;tronger than any in <HI>England:</HI> But the&s;e Trees were &s;o &s;carce and far from hence, that &s;ingle Men could not go often enough, in any rea&s;onable Time, to fetch the Leaves; and as great a Number as we were, we went twice for as much only as would cover one Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN we had fini&s;h'd our Ma&s;ter's, we went about our own Hutches; and as at <HI>Deaan Me|phontey's,</HI> &s;o here al&s;o, a &s;mall one &s;erv'd my Turn; for notwith&s;tanding our &s;trong Walls and Fortification, I did not know whether we &s;hould be able to keep them long; as it prov'd &s;oon after: So I made my Hut no bigger, than to have Room convenient to lye at my
<PB N="151" REF="170">
Length, and make a Fire in; if, by Fortune, I &s;hould get any Victuals to dre&s;s.</P>
<P>ABOUT a Week after we were &s;ettl'd in our New Town, a Me&s;&s;enger, (or rather, an Am|ba&s;&s;ador) arriv'd from <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> with twenty People in his Retinue. His Bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;ound <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s Inclinations, and (if there was any Room) to de&s;ire his Friend&s;hip: He &s;oon found there was Rea&s;on to hope for Succe&s;s, and, therefore, deliver'd his Me&s;&s;age the fir&s;t Night he came. To which <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> an&s;wer'd, He would con&s;ider of it, con&s;ult his People, and give him his An&s;wer the next Morning. In the mean Time, he gave him a Slave's Hou&s;e to repo&s;e him&s;elf in, as is the Cu&s;tom on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; and &s;ent a Bullock for him, and his Attendants. He next &s;ent out Me&s;&s;engers to all the Chiefs and Freemen, to come and con&s;ult with him on a Matter of great Im|portance. I was pre&s;ent, and &s;aw this A&s;&s;em|bly, <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> being &s;eated, the Principals plac'd them|&s;elves on either Hand; and the other Freemen on each Side of them.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> open'd the Con&s;ultation by telling them, <Q>&startq;&endq;That <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> had &s;ent a very honourable Me&s;&s;enger to him to de&s;ire his Friend&s;hip and A&s;&s;i&s;tance. We mu&s;t not forget, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that <HI>Deaan</HI>

<P>WHEN I &s;aw the Manner and Form of this A&s;&s;embly, our Parliament in <HI>Great Britain</HI> run &s;trangely in my Head, I thought this very like it; and tho' I was but a Boy when I went from Home, yet my Father keeping a publick Hou&s;e, I remember often to have heard Gentle|men di&s;puting with one another about the Power of the Prince, to command the People to do what he pleas'd without con&s;ulting them; while others &s;aid, a King had no Power without a Parliament. Then they would di&s;pute about the Original of Parliaments, and the Power they had; and who brought the U&s;e of them fir&s;t into <HI>England;</HI> in this too they &s;eldom agreed. Some &s;aid the <HI>Saxons,</HI> others it was &s;ince their Time; while many were of Opi|nions
<PB N="154" REF="173">
different from either of the&s;e. Now I think this might be decided without refer|ring to Authors and Hi&s;tories, That the Ori|ginal of Parliaments was long before the <HI>Sax|ons</HI> or <HI>Romans</HI> either: for I imagine, that <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and other Countries too, were once like <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> without the Knowledge of Let|ters, and Coin'd Money; it was then impo&s;|&s;ible for Princes and Lords to command Peo|ple, or di&s;po&s;e of them contrary to their In|clinations, or Intere&s;t: For I &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e Princes to be like my Ma&s;ter, who had not, nor could have any &s;eparate Army, or Inte|re&s;t; but when any Neighbour crav'd their Help, or Enemy had offended them, they a&s;|&s;embl'd before the Hou&s;e of their Chief, and there they con&s;ulted what Mea&s;ures were pro|per to be taken for their Safety and Intere&s;t: If War was agreed on, the &s;ame Men took their Arms, and the Lord headed them, as my Ma&s;ter did here; and when they return'd, every Man went Home to his Family. Thus the People are them&s;elves their own Army and Defence, and the Lord could not oblige them to do tho&s;e Things, which the greater Part did not think convenient to do; becau&s;e he had no Army to force them. This was, with|out Doubt, the Condition of all other Coun|tries once, and mu&s;t have remain'd &s;o, if Peo|ple had not betray'd them&s;elves unwarily in|to

the Power of one Man, by giving him Wealth and Authority to rai&s;e an Army, keep it in Pay him&s;elf, and u&s;e it at Di&s;cretion for their Defence; with which he wickedly in|&s;ulted, and abus'd them. But in the State of Nature, and the Beginning of Mens joining in Societies, this was the Form of Government; and with due Reverence to the Learned, I think, we need not turn over many Volumes to find the Original of <HI>Briti&s;h Parliaments;</HI> for they are earlier than all their Hi&s;tories, or even Letters them&s;elves; and as to their Power, it is founded on the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> REASON and NATURE.</P>
<P>THE Alliance being re&s;olv'd on, the next Morning <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> &s;ent for the Me&s;|&s;enger, and told him, he had con&s;ulted his People, and they unanimou&s;ly agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Deaan Murnanzack;</HI> and de&s;ir'd that their Friend&s;hip might be bound with the u&s;ual Solemnity: So an Ox was brought and kill'd, the Liver roa&s;ted, and put on Lances, and <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;ador, and a chief Man deputed by <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> eat the Liver between them, repeating the Impreca|tion; that they wi&s;h'd it might prove Poi&s;on, and a further Cur&s;e might be &s;ent by God upon them, who fir&s;t broke the Alliance.</P>
<P>THIS &s;olemn Ratification being fini&s;h'd, the Ox was divided between the Amba&s;&s;ador's

<P>BUT the Cour&s;e of my Hi&s;tory leads me to relate <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Attacking <HI>Deaan Mundumber</HI>'s Town; where he took three hun|dred Cattle, and a great many Pri&s;oners, Wo|men, and Children, for it is never the Cu&s;|tom to take Men; if they can't get away from their Enemies, they are kill'd. Among the Captives were <HI>Deaan Mundumber</HI>'s Wife, and his only Child, a Daughter. After they
<PB N="157" REF="176">
had plunder'd the Town, they were going to burn it, when <HI>Deaan Murnanzaok</HI> hinder'd them, and march'd into the Plain, waiting to &s;ee if <HI>Deaan Mundumber</HI> would rally, and give him Battle. They appeard, indeed, but at a great Di&s;tance, not daring to come near him; which, when he &s;aw, he march'd home|wards, yet not without doing a very generous Action; which was &s;ending back <HI>Deaan Mun|dumber</HI>'s Wife and Daughter to him; telling her, he did not mean it as a Compliment to her Husband, but in re&s;pect to her&s;elf, and Family; &s;he being Neice to the King of <HI>Yung-Owl,</HI> one of the greate&s;t Princes on the I&s;land: Nor did he do it to give him an Example of returning the like; for he had no Wife, and was well a&s;&s;ur'd, by the Help of God who would favour his ju&s;t Cau&s;e, that it would not be in his Power to take his Family.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> heard of his Son's Town being taken, he thought it was high Time to revenge them; and accordingly mu&s;ters a great Army, threatning how he would ruin the Country, de&s;tory the Men, and make Slaves of their Families. He al&s;o &s;ent to our Ma&s;ter to join him, which he peremptorily refus'd, &s;aying, "He would not join with his profe&s;s'd "Enemies again&s;t his experienc'd Friends;" but did not declare his Intentions of being again&s;t him. They both &s;ent to <HI>Deaan Me|phontey,</HI>

<P>WHEN <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> march'd from <HI>Fenno|arevo,</HI> he did not leave his Towns quite de&s;ti|tute of Men, for Fear of <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> and <HI>Afferrer;</HI> but he never &s;u&s;pected us. While he was gone <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mevar|row</HI> join'd their Forces, and went out to &s;ee what they could get; they &s;urpris'd three Towns, the Men making a very weak Re&s;i&s;tance; &s;o they brought off about two hundred Cattle and fifty Slaves. My Ma&s;ter was di&s;cover'd by my being (a white Man) with him. This was unexpected to them, and <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Wife immediately &s;ent him Word of it; and that &s;he was in Fear of us. To which he an&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;He would &s;oon di&s;patch the Bu&s;ine&s;s he was about, and then he would be &s;ufficiently re|veng'd of <HI>Deaan Mevarrow;&endq;</HI></Q> but we took Care to be provided for him.</P>
<P>IN the Way homewards, the Cattle and Slaves were divided equally between <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> and <HI>Rer Mimebolambo;</HI> and they then re&s;olv'd, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to live together in one Town. Ours was the

We lo&s;t no Time, for the very &s;ame Day we went Home, we pack'd up our Goods, and march'd away to <HI>Merhaundrovarta,</HI> which was the Name of <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI>'s Town; and de&s;erted our own in a Fortnight after we had built it. Thus were we driven about like wild Boars, which in this Country change their Holes every Day, and go from one Wood to ano|ther, for Fear the wild Dogs &s;hould find them out. And we were not only forc'd to &s;ecure our|&s;elves again&s;t the Surpri&s;es of a Body of our Enemies, but living &s;o near each other, three or four, or half a dozen of their Men would often lurk privately in the Woods near Towns, to &s;ee if they could catch a Woman, Child, or Slave of ours &s;traying out, or on any Bu&s;ine&s;s, as dig|ging wild Yams, &amp;c. &s;o that we had very &s;el|dom any Thing el&s;e to eat but Beef; and tho&s;e who had it of their own gave to them who had none.</P>
<P>BUT I had an Employment here, which maintain'd me hand&s;omely; and it &s;eem'd as if Providence had pleas'd to appoint it on pur|po&s;e for my Support in this Time of Scarcity: The People of this Part of the I&s;land do not

care to eat Beef, which is not kill'd by one de&s;cended from a Race of Kings; now my Ma|&s;ter, ju&s;t before the War broke out, growing high and proud, and having none but him&s;elf, and his Brother to do the&s;e Offices, they were &s;ometimes oblig'd to go five or &s;ix Miles to kill an Ox: He, at length, con&s;ider'd that the&s;e People have a great Opinion of all white Men, and more e&s;pecially taking me for the Cap|tain's Son, whom they look'd upon to be the &s;ame as a King, I was thought of honourable De&s;cent enough to be preferr'd to the Dig|nity of a Butcher; tho' in Truth, I did no more than cut the Throat of the Bea&s;t, and they cut him up them&s;elves; for this I always had my Fee, which was a large Piece of Meat. My Ma&s;ter, as well as many others, &s;aw that this was a very ridiculous Cu&s;tom; but he al&s;o knew that the Vulgar are not to be violently oppos'd in their old WAYS, be they ever &s;o fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd; and had <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> peevi&s;hly refus'd to do this Office, and call'd it a &s;illy Humour of theirs, &s;uch an abrupt Inno|vation would have been attended with almo&s;t a general De&s;ertion; for they would have gone, and liv'd under other Lords: He, therefore, con|triv'd to &s;ub&s;titute me in his Place, and by that Means did (as all wi&s;e Governors will) &s;eemingly conform to Cu&s;tom to Oblige the People; yet by an ingenious Expedient &s;hifted off from him|&s;elf a mean and trouble&s;ome Office.</P>

THE next Morning the Cattle were &s;har'd, my Ma&s;ter had ten, his Brother &s;ix, and the principal Men one a Piece; &s;ome others one between two; and we Slaves one between four. Now I wanted not Beef, for I was of|ten employ'd, while in this Town, to kill the Bea&s;ts; neverthele&s;s I was oblig'd to agree with my Partners to kill ours, for they wanted it tho' I did not. I liv'd pretty well here, often changing Beef for Potatoes, &amp;c. with the Towns-People, and here we heard of the Ravage <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> made in the Country: The People, who were ally'd to <HI>Deaan Mur|nanzack,</HI> and liv'd in &s;mall Towns, left their Habitations, and went with their Families and Cattle beyond <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s to|ward the Sea, where they were under his Pro|tection. When <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> came to the de|&s;erted Towns, he burnt them, and utterly de|&s;troy'd the Plantations, pulling up every Thing by the Roots, as if his De&s;ign was to cau&s;e a Famine in the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> was all this While with his Brother <HI>Mu&s;&s;ecorow,</HI> marching towards them, and had &s;uch good Intelligence, that he came under Cover of a Wood undi&s;cover'd, almo&s;t upon them. They were then making wretched Havock of a very large Plantation of Pota|toes, and &s;ome other adjacent Ones. He di|vided his Army into four Parts, re&s;olving to

attack them on every Side, while they were about their accur&s;ed Bu&s;ine&s;s, him&s;elf boldly &s;hewing his Face in Front, whom they hur|ry'd to oppo&s;e; while the other Parties firing each from their Po&s;t, kill'd a great many, and put the re&s;t into Confu&s;ion. However, they made a vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance, retreating and forcing their Way to a Wood; where it was not practicable to follow them. Here <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> rally'd them, and put them in good Order, in proper Divi&s;ions, each one un|der his own, or one of his Son's Command; for his three Sons, <HI>Mundumber, Chahary,</HI> and <HI>Frukey</HI> were with him: They were a great many more in Number than the other, &s;ome &s;aid, near twice as many; which <HI>Deaan Mur|nanzack</HI> knew very well, as al&s;o his Uncle's Courage; but he was, neverthele&s;s, re&s;olv'd to engage him: And tho' he had Time enough to have retreated, yet he only march'd back into the Plain, to have good Ground and Time to form his Army; which he did, and waited for his Enemy's Coming to attack him. It was not long before they fell on very furi|ou&s;ly, and were as hotly receiv'd, firing and throwing Lances; till <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> per|ceiving his Brother <HI>Mu&s;&s;ecorrow</HI>'s Divi&s;ion be|gan to give Ground, he was re&s;olv'd to make one vigorous Pu&s;h him&s;elf, and throwing away his Gun, he, with &s;ix &s;mall Lances in his

Hand, challeng'd &s;everal of his principal Men to follow him, if they dur&s;t, into the thicke&s;t of the Enemy's Body, which they very gal|lantly did; but he, being formo&s;t, ran like an enraged Lion, and in &s;pite of all their Fire and flying Lances, came to clo&s;e fighting Hand to Hand with his Lances; and tho&s;e gallant Men with him following his Exam|ple, drove all that Divi&s;ion of their Enemy's Army back, and put it into utter Confu&s;ion; and they, not being able to abide their Fury, ran for it. They broke into the very Part where <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> him&s;elf was fighting, who had been &s;truck through with a Lance by one of <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Companions, had he not generou&s;ly him&s;elf prevented it; de&s;iring them not to kill his Uncle. He left his Peo|ple to per&s;ue them, and him&s;elf ran to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Mu&s;&s;ecorrow,</HI> who, at the &s;ame Time, made a bold Pu&s;h, being a&s;ham'd to be out-done; ne|verthele&s;s they had been ruin'd, had not <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> him&s;elf came to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in that Juncture; but they were &s;oon in one general Rout and Di&s;order, running towards the Woods, where <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> follow'd them to keep them from rallying; and car|ry'd on the Pur&s;uit till he &s;aw they were di|&s;pirited, and making towards their own Home to recruit them&s;elves.</P>

<P>WE were oblig'd to go round about by tedious unpractis'd Ways, and to look out di|ligently, for Fear our Enemies &s;hould inter|cept us; but we had cho&s;en an Opportunity when they were di&s;pirited by their Defeat, and &s;u&s;pected nothing of any &s;uch Prize be|ing near them: So we arriv'd in two Days at <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s Town on the Hills of <HI>Yong|gorvo,</HI> where we &s;topp'd two Days to re&s;t our Cattle; and were going on the third in the Morning, when we heard a Shell blow. This put the Town and Country in an Uproar, expecting Enemies; they ran immediately to defend the Pa&s;&s;age up the Hill (for there is but one) when pre&s;ently came two Me&s;&s;en|gers from <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> to <HI>Deaan Affer|rer,</HI> to tell him, that he was at the Bottom of the Hill coming to vi&s;it him. When my Guardians &s;aw them join, and perceiv'd it was <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> as &s;oon as the u&s;ual Civili|ties were over between the two Brothers, they went to <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> and told him, that <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> had &s;ent &s;ome Cattle, and a Man to look after them, to be convey'd &s;omewhere

<P><HI>WHEN</HI> Deaan Murnanzack <HI>came to &s;ee the Cattle, and found me left with them, he &s;eem'd &s;urpris'd: He ask'd me, if</HI> I was Cow|keeper? <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> He never heard of a white Man being put to look after Cattle. <HI>I told him,</HI> It was my Ma&s;ter's Plea&s;ure, and that I did not di&s;pute it with him; but mu&s;t do it as well as I could.</P>
<P>THREE Days after <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> went homeward, ordering three Servants to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, and we follow'd in the Rear; we had al&s;o with us above a dozen other People, who car|ry'd Provi&s;ion, Bedding, &amp;c. for their Ma|&s;ters. When we were down the Hill I found a new Scene, the Soil was of a quite different Colour and Nature, yellow Clay with Stones, which made m$ Feet unea&s;y, being us'd be|fore to a &s;andy Country; but I was &s;oon har|$en&punc;d to it: The Trees al&s;o were different, $word$ and $aller. This was the Place I had $word$ wi&s;h'd to &s;ee for the wild Cattle, of $word$ I had heard &s;o much: I &s;oon found the $word$ $word$ they made thorow the Woods;

which render'd it ea&s;ier driving mine than in other Woods.</P>
<P>ABOUT Noon we re&s;ted in a Grove: The whole Country is very beautiful, and finely water'd with Springs and Rivulets. They &s;hew'd me &s;ome wild Cattle &s;tanding under the Trees; I was eager to &s;ee them nearer, and taking a Gun in my Hand, went toward them; but within thirty Yards I was oblig'd to creep on the Ground, hiding my&s;elf as well as I could with the Gra&s;s, which is very long. When I came nearer to them, I &s;aw three other Bulls running directly toward me; their Eyes &s;parkl'd with Fire, their Ears prick'd upright, and foaming at the Mouth; it was &s;uppos'd they fled from &s;ome Hun|ters. They put me into a great Fright, in|&s;omuch that I thought of nothing but firing at them, to frighten them away; but as Luck would have it, I &s;hot, and wounded one &s;o that he fell: Notwith&s;tanding he was down, I expected the others would have a&s;&s;aulted me, and, therefore, laid flat on my Face, not da|ring to &s;tir for Fear; till hearing no other Noi&s;e, but my Companions hallowing at a Di|&s;tance, I look'd up, and &s;aw they were all run away, but the wounded one, kicking upon the Ground; whom I dur&s;t not go near, till they came, and put us both out of our Pain, by cutting his Throat, and extolling me for my

Courage, and being an excellent Mark&s;-man! See how contrary to one's Expectation Things happen&punc; I thought of being laugh'd at for my Cowardice, and was applauded by Mi&s;take, and Chance, for Bravery.</P>
<P>WHILE they were cutting up the Bull, I could not forbear looking with Wonder, at tho&s;e, which they call'd <HI>Wild Cattle,</HI> and which are, indeed, &s;o here; but they are &s;o like our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cattle in every re&s;pect, that I could &s;ee no Difference: Nor &s;ince I have been bet|ter acquainted with them have I di&s;cover'd any; except that, I think, the Horns of our Bulls in <HI>England</HI> are &s;omewhat &s;horter, and they roar louder than the&s;e wild Bulls. When we had cut up our Beef, we roa&s;ted &s;ome; and were not a little pleas'd with the Thoughts of our Ma&s;ters leaving us, becau&s;e we &s;hould not &s;poil their Sport, and we happen'd on better Luck than they, and had Beef to eat &s;ooner; as al&s;o &s;ome ready to dre&s;s for them at the Place appointed to meet at Night: You may be &s;ure, this Bull-beef could not be comparable in Goodne&s;s to that of the tame; e&s;pecially after it had run &s;o much before it was kill'd. The&s;e wild Cattle &s;ometimes give the Hunters a Chace of &s;everal Miles after they are wounded, which makes the Fle&s;h very indifferent Meat, e&s;pecially if it is a Bull; but People are glad of what they can get,
<PB N="169" REF="188">
when they are in Want: For the&s;e wild Cat|tle are a great Benefit to People in remote Parts, who, in nece&s;&s;itous Times, come here on hunting; tho' they are al&s;o as plentiful in another va&s;t Tract of Fore&s;t Land of &s;ome hundred Miles in Extent; of which I &s;hall have an Occa&s;ion to give an Account, and al&s;o of their &s;uppos'd Original. The Place where we baited at Noon, and lay this Night were agreeable and delightful Groves; and &s;o, in|deed, is all this Country for &s;everal Days Jour|nies, abounding in wild Honey, wild Boars, good, whole&s;om and plea&s;ant Fruits of the Trees and Earth; and the&s;e in &s;uch Variety, that Men may not only find enough to &s;a|tisfy their Hunger and Thir&s;t; but even to indulge their luxurious Appetites, without the Pains of cultivating and planting; and many do &s;o live.</P>
<P>AMONG the mo&s;t u&s;eful and plea&s;ant Fruits of the Earth is the <HI>Faungidge,</HI> which I here fir&s;t &s;aw; my Companions taking me with them into the thicke&s;t Woods. They look fir&s;t for the Place, which is a tender Creeper, or wild Vine taking hold of a Tree, or any Thing which &s;tands next it; twining round the Body, even to the Top of the Tree, and dividing it&s;elf into &s;everal Branches, like a Vine. I never ob&s;erv'd any Fruit it bore, and was amas'd, when they told me, it was the Root
<PB N="170" REF="189">
of this, which produc'd the <HI>Faungidge;</HI> and yet in&s;tead of digging at the Root, they went about half a dozen Yards from it round a|bout, and &s;truck the Ground with the End of their Lances, to find where it &s;ounded hol|low; and there digging, they took up the <HI>Faungidge.</HI> The Root &s;preads a great Way under Ground, and there are but few Branches of it, which bear the <HI>Faungidge:</HI> So that it might be endle&s;s tracing it from where it ap|pears above Ground. The fir&s;t which I &s;aw dug here, was not much le&s;s in Bulk than a Gallon Runlet: It is red and &s;mooth with|out, the Coat as thin as a Parchment, the In|&s;ide is white, and has a milky Juice; it eats as &s;oft as a Water-Mellon, but has no Seeds in it; it is both Meat and Drink, very whol|&s;ome, and always eaten raw.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Verlaway</HI> is of the &s;ame Kind, very little different in every re&s;pect; except that the Skin of the latter is thinner, but &s;o tough, that it mu&s;t be par'd with a Knife. There is another Sort of this, call'd the <HI>Verlaway-voler;</HI> which we look on to be unwho&s;ome: I once &s;aw a Man, who had eaten &s;ome of it, and it made him &s;well and &s;ick; but by giv|ing him &s;ome melted Fat to drink, he brought it up, and was reliev'd. This <HI>Verlaway-voler</HI> is ea&s;ily known, it being more beautiful to the Eye, and the Leaf which &s;prings from it is very indifferent.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="190">
THE next Day I &s;aw excellent Sport: For <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> not leaving us, as he did the Day before, in the Morning we &s;aw one &s;ingle Bull alone in the Mid&s;t of a large Plain; he, having a Mind for a little Diver&s;ion, order'd us to &s;top, while him&s;elf, and two more drove my Cattle toward the Bull; who no &s;ooner &s;aw them approach, but he fell a roaring, and dig|ging up the Ground with his Horns, as if he expected &s;ome other was coming to fight him; when he perceiv'd Cows, he &s;hew'd an Inclina|tion to be better acquainted with them: The <HI>Deaan,</HI> and his Companions conceal'd them|&s;elves under Cover of the Cows, and letting them graze a little, and then driving them a little, till the wild Bull was among&s;t them; and ju&s;t as he was putting his No&s;e to a Cow's Tail, <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> from under another Cow's Belly, &s;tuck a Lance in his Flank; a|way he ran with it, but not till he had ano|ther &s;tuck in his Side: And now they had Room for the Sport they aim'd at, which was not unlike what I have heard de&s;crib'd of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Bull-Fea&s;ts. Several now came in|to the Chace, he ran near a Mile out-right before he &s;topp'd, and turn'd to the Pur&s;uers; which is what they always do, when they find them&s;elves &s;orely wounded; and then let every Man take Care of him&s;elf: For it is a dange|rous Encounter, as it was here, the Bea&s;t was
<PB N="172" REF="191">
outragious, and turning upon them, ran di|rectly at the Man who threw a Lance at him, while another from behind threw another; then the Bull turn'd again, as he always does, to the Man whom he &s;ees throw at him; and the Hunters being divided to take him which Way &s;oever he turns, and al&s;o keeping a good Di&s;tance, as well to prevent hurting one ano|ther, as to give him Scope to play in, they at length kill'd him; but this &s;ometimes proves a tragical Pa&s;time, and I have &s;een a Man kill'd at it.</P>
<P>THIS Night we lay in a Wood, where we found <HI>Faungidge</HI> enough; thus we liv'd deli|ciou&s;ly with only what the Country yielded us. I ty'd up my Calves every Night, to keep my Cows from &s;traying, and was forc'd to ri&s;e two or three Times, to &s;ee that none of my Cattle got among the wild Ones; for when|ever they do, it is trouble&s;ome catching them again; they running whenever they &s;ee the others run, and almo&s;t as fa&s;t.</P>
<P>THE next Day at Noon we halted at a Spring, which comes from the highe&s;t Hill in this I&s;land, call'd <HI>Vohitch-Maner,</HI> or Red-Hill; <HI>Vohitch</HI> &s;ignifying Hill, or Mountain. I drove my Cattle into a fine Valley, where there was good Gra&s;s; and there came among them a wild Bull, and mounted one of my Cows: I had a great Mind to try to kill him, tho'
<PB N="173" REF="192">
I almo&s;t &s;hook for Fear; they are terrible Creatures to any Body's View who is not us'd to them, and it was this Fear was the Cau&s;e of my ill Succe&s;s; for covering my&s;elf under another Cow, I made &s;uch an awkward Stroak at him, that I wounded one of my own in|&s;tead of him. However, as it did not prove mortal I conceal'd it; not &s;o much for Fear of any Danger I was in from the Anger of my Ma&s;ter, as that I knew I &s;hould have been laugh'd at, for wounding a tame Cow in&s;tead of a wild Bull.</P>
<P>WE &s;et up early this Afternnoon, in a Place conveniently &s;ituated near good Water; and then we went out to &s;ee for <HI>Wild Honey</HI> and <HI>Faungidge.</HI> I had the good Fortune to meet with a large Hole in a hollow Tree full of it; I made a Fire, and with a Brand &s;moak'd the Bees out. I next cut down a <HI>Vounturk,</HI> to make a Ve&s;&s;el like a Tub, to put my Honey in. This <HI>Vounturk</HI> is a Tree, or Plant, (for I don't know which to call it) of a very &s;in|gular Shape and Nature: It grows upright about &s;ixteen or eighteen Foot high, &s;mall below, big in the Middle, and &s;mall again above, like a Nine-pin; at the Top are two or three Branches bearing very long Leaves; in the Spring they have Blo&s;&s;oms, but I never &s;aw any Fruit come to Perfection; the outer Bark is whiti&s;h, like old Lead, and full of
<PB N="174" REF="193">
Thorns four or five Inches long; which are, however, very ea&s;ily &s;truck off with a Lance, with which al&s;o we cut the Bark round, and the Tree immediately falls down, not being able to &s;upport it&s;elf: We then take away what Length we want, and with our Hands pull out the &s;pungy Sub&s;tance on the In&s;ide, till within three or four Inches of the Bot|tom. Thus we make a Ve&s;&s;el light and ea&s;y of Carriage, and in one of the&s;e I put my Ho|ney. The Liquor of this <HI>Vounturk</HI> is good Drink, and even fit to boil any Thing in, when Water is &s;carce. I found al&s;o &s;ome <HI>Faun|gidge.</HI> When I return'd, I went to <HI>Deaan Mur|nanzack,</HI> and made him a Pre&s;ent of &s;ome Ho|ney; which is a Compliment our Lords always expect.</P>
<P>IT was now Night, and they were going a Beef-hunting: When they go out on Purpo&s;e to kill the be&s;t Bea&s;ts, they always choo&s;e a dark Night. They admitted me, on my Re|que&s;t, to go with them; bidding me wa&s;h my&s;elf, as they all did, that we might not &s;mell of Smoak, nor Sweat. I took two Lan|ces as u&s;ual, but they made me leave one be|hind me, le&s;t two might rattle in my Hand. The&s;e Cattle feed only in the Night, and if they did not take all the&s;e Precautions they could never &s;urpri&s;e them; for they are al|ways on their Guard, &s;norting with their No&s;es,
<PB N="175" REF="194">
and li&s;tening after Enemies. We can hear them bellow, and the Bulls roar a great Way off; by which we know where they are, and always go round till they are directly to the Windward of us: For if we were to go toward them with the Wind, they would &s;oon &s;cent us. When we had got the Wind and Cattle right-a-head, and were within hearing, we walk'd very &s;oftly and circum&s;pectly; pulling the Top of the Gra&s;s with our Hands, as near as was po&s;&s;ible, mimicking the Noi&s;e a Cow makes with biting it. They no &s;ooner heard us, but they were all hu&s;h on a &s;udden; no bellowing, nor grazing, but &s;tood &s;till li&s;ten|ing: Which when we perceiv'd, we all &s;tood likewi&s;e without &s;peaking, or walking, only three or four who under&s;tood it be&s;t, kept pulling the Gra&s;s. When the Cattle had li|&s;ten'd, till (as we &s;uppo&s;e) they took us to be &s;ome of their own Kind, they fell to gra|zing again, and we walk'd cautiou&s;ly on nearer, mimicking them. <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> made me keep behind, for fear they &s;hould e&s;py my white Skin, and be frighted; he al&s;o gave me his Lamber to cover my&s;elf with, which was black Silk; &s;o that if I had been in their View, they could have &s;een nothing but my Face; for the Gra&s;s is above Knee deep.</P>
<P>WE got at length among&s;t them, &s;o that one of our Men (as he told me) with &s;ome
<PB N="176" REF="195">
Gra&s;s in his Hand, and under the Cover of a Bu&s;h, took hold of the Dug of a Cow, and felt whether &s;he gave Milk; but finding &s;he did not, he concluded &s;he was not lean; and therefore &s;tuck his Lance into her Belly, and pull'd it out again, making no other Motion him&s;elf. The Cow which is wounded will, perhaps, give a Spring, and make a Noi&s;e, as if another had run her Horns again&s;t her; and this is &s;o common among them, that the Herd is not di&s;turb'd by it: So that our Peo|ple &s;tuck three or four on this Manner, and left them, with Intent to come the next Morn|ing, and track them by their Blood; it being dangerous to come near them in the Night: For when they find them&s;elves &s;orely wounded, they run away from their Companions, and will a&s;&s;ault any Man they &s;ee. They are com|monly found lying dead, or fallen in &s;ome Wood, or Shelter of Bu&s;hes, as if they en|deavour'd to hide them&s;elves. Ju&s;t as we were going away, and I had return'd <HI>Deaan Mur|nanzack</HI> his Lamber, a Calf, who was mor|tally wounded, began to make an Uproar; and running about, made the Herd &s;u&s;pect &s;omething: So that away they ran, and the Calf came directly at me, and beat me back|wards; I catch'd hold of his Leg, and call'd out for Help. This Accident caus'd Laugh|ter, and was a Je&s;t upon me, for calling out
<PB N="177" REF="196">
for Help again&s;t a little Calf: However, they took him, cut him to Pieces, and carry'd him away; of whom we made a good Supper. I have heard, that notwith&s;tanding the Wild|ne&s;s of the&s;e Cattle; the Cows will &s;tand &s;till to have their Dugs handl'd, and in the Night have been milk'd into an Horn; but as I ne|ver did this my&s;elf, I cannot vouch the Truth of it; yet I have been &s;o often told it, I can|not help crediting it.</P>
<P>WE made no Ha&s;te homeward, for our&s;elves and Cattle too, liv'd as well as we could there; &s;o that tho' we kept going on, yet we made &s;everal Days more of our Journey than we &s;hould have done. A Day, or two, after this Beef-hunt|ing, we had an accidental Sport of another kind: Our Dogs had got the Scent of wild Hogs in a Thicket, and were very bu&s;y running round it; but could find no Entrance for a long Time. At length they di&s;cover'd the Path the Swine had made, and attempted to enter the Wood by it; the Pa&s;&s;age was defended by a huge Boar, who fought the Dogs, and wounded one of them dangerou&s;ly: Now what with the Dogs and the Swine, here was &s;uch a yelping, grunting, and &s;quaulling, that the Woods rang with their Noi&s;e; and one would have thought, all the Hogs in the I&s;land had agreed to meet here, and &s;ight out their Quarrel again&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="197">
WE laid down our Burdens, and &s;ome of us went to them, arm'd with Guns and Lan|ces; <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> &s;hot the Boar, who wounded his Dog; when immediately came another, and defended the Entrance, fighting &s;o re&s;olutely, that neither the Dogs, nor our|&s;elves could come at the Herd, who were within; till we made a Way behind them with our Hatchets and Lances, and then fir'd, and kill'd &s;ome of the &s;toute&s;t who turn'd to us: The others &s;eeing them&s;elves attack'd behind, fought their Way through the Dogs, and ran for it, with the Dogs after them. It is im|po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe in Words the Noi&s;e there was, e&s;pecially after &s;everal were wounded. We found &s;even dead, be&s;ides &s;ome &s;o hurt that they could not make off; we pick'd out only one of the fatte&s;t, for there are very few will eat them. I did not dare to take it, be|cau&s;e of my Office of killing Beeves; and the Eating of Swine's Fle&s;h is &s;o contemptible, that I &s;hould have le&s;&s;en'd my Dignity, and been degraded from my Office; which, what|ever mean Thoughts I might have, as to the Honour of it, I had too great an Opinion of its Value, to part with for the Gratification of my Appetite in one Meal; for they are curious to a Punctilio in this Ca&s;e, that if the Daughter of a King is marry'd to any one that is not of a King's Family, their Children are
<PB N="179" REF="198">
not admitted to the Honour of killing Beeves, tho' the Father be a Freeman, and a Chief among&s;t his Neighbours.</P>
<P>EVERY Evening we us'd to &s;it down near the Prince, and talk of one thing or another to pa&s;s away the Time: Now it is the ge|neral U&s;age of the Princes here, to conver&s;e very familiarly with every Body; yet do they, neverthele&s;s, pre&s;erve a decent State and Di|&s;tinction. The People all over the I&s;land have a religious Regard to Dreams, and think that the good <HI>Daemon</HI> (for I know not what Name el&s;e to give to the inferior Deities, which, they &s;ay, attends each to its re&s;pective <HI>Owley)</HI> comes, and tells them in their Dreams, when they ought to do a Thing, or to warn them of &s;ome Danger; more e&s;pecially after a Sacrifice and Prayer made to God, and Invocation of this <HI>Daemon.</HI> I very well remember the Di&s;cour&s;e this Evening was on this Subject; the next Morning <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> came to me as I was alone, and talk'd very freely with me about many Things; particularly advi&s;ing me to take what Beef I wanted, and could carry, for we &s;hould have no more Oppor|tunities of killing wild Cattle after this Day. When I ob&s;erv'd him de&s;irous of Conver&s;a|tion, I told him, if there was any Thing in Dreams, as &s;ome had &s;aid the Night before, I &s;hould have a great Deal of Anger from
<PB N="180" REF="199">
him that Day, having dream'd, <Q>&startq;That I was at my Father's Hou&s;e, with my Parents and Relations about me; my Pockets full of Gold, and they giving more. This, <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> did not only throw me into a Melancholy when I awak'd, to find my&s;elf naked in a Wood, and a &s;trange Country, in&s;tead of my Fa|ther's Hou&s;e; but it al&s;o gave me &s;ome Concern, for that I had always remark'd when I was a Boy in <HI>England,</HI> and al&s;o un|der my Ma&s;ter <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> that to dream of <HI>Plenty of Gold-Money</HI> was a certain Sign of Anger.&endq;</Q> At this <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> &s;mil'd, and an&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;I wonder that you, who, but la&s;t Night, laugh'd at the Talk of God's &s;ending Dreams by the good <HI>Daemons,</HI> &s;hould now be afraid of one. However, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I dare &s;ay, you will be mi&s;taken in this, for I don't know any Thing you can do to make me angry.&endq;</Q> I would not have my Reader think, I trouble him with this Story, meerly for the &s;ake of telling a fooli&s;h Dream; but it prov'd the Introduction to &s;omething very remarkable, and furni&s;h'd us with a Di&s;cour&s;e the next Evening worth repeating.</P>
<P>THE next Day we roa&s;ted our Beef, and laid it to cool, in Order to bind up in a Bur|den, which we call <HI>an Enter,</HI> to carry at our Backs. I had nothing to do but to provide for my&s;elf, and what with my Beef and Ho|ney,
<PB N="181" REF="200">
I was pretty well loaded, and as well contented, for I liv'd plentifully and delici|ou&s;ly; my Honey al&s;o mix'd with Water made me a plea&s;ant Drink. This was the la&s;t Day of our pa&s;&s;ing through the&s;e Groves and Habitations of the wild Cattle; &s;ome of which they made another Attempt to &s;urround, more for the Sport-&s;ake than Want of Beef; and in this, I, for Want of Knowledge, &s;poil'd all their Diver&s;ion, by cro&s;&s;ing the Way they were running, which was towards the Place where <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> laid in Ambu&s;h for them: This caus'd them to run another Way, and put him into a furious Pa&s;&s;ion at fir&s;t; in&s;omuch that he lifted up his Lance, threat|ning to kill me, and I expected no le&s;s; which made me get away from him as fa&s;t as I could, and keep out of Sight, dreading &s;ome &s;uch barbarous Treatment, as I had before receiv'd from <HI>Deaan Mevarrow:</HI> But this Prince was of a more generous Di&s;po&s;ition, for when his Pa&s;&s;ion was over, he &s;ent for me, and de&s;ir'd I would come in the Evening, as u&s;ual, and &s;it down by him; which I did: He then de|&s;ir'd me to give him &s;ome Account of the Cu&s;toms of my Country; and particularly, <HI>What God, or Gods we wor&s;hip,</HI> &s;ince I &s;eem'd to have &s;o little Regard to theirs; and that I would be free, and tell them what Things, I (who had been a great Traveller) had &s;een
<PB N="182" REF="201">
in Order to pa&s;s the Evening away the plea|&s;anter. And fir&s;t &s;ays he, <HI>What God do you adore?</HI> On this the Company drew round me, and I began. But,</P>
<P>I fir&s;t de&s;ir'd them to tell me, <Q>&startq;If they did not know there was a God above the Skies.&endq;</Q> I could not &s;ay <HI>Heaven,</HI> beau&s;e there was no Word in their Language which &s;ignifies <HI>Heaven;</HI> nor could I perceive, that they had any Notion of what Chri&s;tians mean by <HI>Hea|ven,</HI> as the Place of God's Re&s;idence, and Man&s;ion of the Saints after this Life. They told me, <Q>&startq;&endq;There was a God above, the &s;u|preme one Lord of all other Gods, Daemons, or Spirits what&s;oever. This very God, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> is the God we wor&s;hip; for we know of no other inferior Gods, nor do we pay Adoration, or make Prayers to any Thing el&s;e, but this One, the Supreme and Only God, and think it not good to adore any other. And do you not, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> make Prayers and Sacrifices, and call upon one of the&s;e Guardian <HI>Daemons</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, and let you know the Mind of God, and warn you of Dangers, and protect you? If your Country-men had &s;uch <HI>Owleys</HI> as we have, the good <HI>Daemons</HI> who are invok'd, when we &s;acrifice before them, would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted ye; and that Night, when ye lay on the Sands, ye would have been told in

Dreams of the Danger, and been directed to e&s;cape before Morning.</Q></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;That all good Men in <HI>England</HI> acknowledge God's Providence, and I think it was by the Providence of God that I was &s;av'd from Death; and why God did not think fit, that the re&s;t &s;hould &s;ave their Lives, is what I do not pretend to know: But I cannot conceive that your <HI>Owleys,</HI> which to me you &s;eem to wor&s;hip, and pray to, &s;hould have a Spirit, or a God within them, and come in the Night when you are a&s;leep, and tell you &s;uch Things. I &s;ee they are Wood, and <HI>Alli|gators</HI> Teeth, only dre&s;s'd up; and I &s;ee, and know how they are made, and I am &s;ure other Wood, and other <HI>Alligators</HI> Teeth are not living Spirits to &s;peak, and &s;ee Things pre&s;ent, much le&s;s Things to come; and we think it abominable to pay that Adoration to any Thing, which belongs on|ly to God; &s;ince the great God him&s;elf has forbid us to wor&s;hip any Thing but him|&s;elf.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> li&s;ten'd to me with At|tention, and then turn'd to &s;ome of his Peo|ple, and rea&s;on'd a good While with them, partly vindicating me, and endeavouring to explain, and argue with them on the&s;e <HI>Ow|leys;</HI> which I find &s;ince, I had not a ju&s;t No|tion

of; but I was too young when reduc'd to this Slavery, and had neither Companions nor Books to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, that I did not attend to make tho&s;e Remarks then, which I could now do.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed, when the <HI>Deaan</HI> had done talking with them, he turn'd to me, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;I think it &s;trange, that you, who but this Morning told me a Dream of yours, and you &s;aw it happen'd true, as you expected, &s;hould argue again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Owleys;</HI> you mi&s;|take us, it is not the Wood, nor the <HI>Alli|gators</HI> Teeth, but there are certain Guar|dian <HI>Daemons,</HI> who will take Care of Na|tions, Families and private Men; and if you have one of the&s;e <HI>Owleys,</HI> and give it the Name of &s;ome Guardian Spirit, it will attend you&punc; For how could you come by the Knowledge this Morning, that I &s;hould be angry with you, if one of the&s;e good <HI>Daemons</HI> had not come to you, and &s;hew'd it, and thereby gave you Warning; and if you had not had this Warning, perhaps, you might have been kill'd, tho' I did not de&s;ign it. But Mens Pa&s;&s;ions are unruly, and I was provok'd, tho' I &s;ay not this to reproach you, as if I thought you &s;poil'd our Hunting on Purpo&s;e; for I know very well you did not mean any Harm, only I put you in Mind, that you argue again&s;t

<P>TO which I an&s;wer'd, that <Q>&startq;No Man ever &s;aw God, but &s;ome of our Fore-fathers did once, many Ages ago, hear his Voice, when he came down, and appear'd to them in a Cloud." But, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if this was &s;o many Years ago, and there is no &s;uch Thing now, nor any Man in the World living, black or white, that ever heard God's Voice, or &s;aw him in a Cloud, how are you &s;ure it is true? And you &s;ay it is many Ages ago, Things may be &s;o chang'd, or mi&s;reprented, from what they were, when your fir&s;t Fore-fathers told them, that you cannot depend
<PB N="186" REF="205">
on their Certainty.&endq;</Q> I was here at a great Lo&s;s, becau&s;e they had no Knowledge of Let|ters; and therefore, I could not make them under&s;tanding any Thing of the Scriptures: I only told them, we had a Way of pre&s;erv|ing the Memory of Things, which they knew nothing of; and by this Means, I &s;aid, we had an Account of the <HI>Beginning of the World,</HI> and of <HI>Its being created by God;</HI> and that I could tell them a great many &s;trange Things relating thereunto; which they then de&s;ir'd to hear.</P>
<P>AND accordingly I told them, that the <HI>World was originally dark, and a confu&s;ed Heap;</HI> and that <HI>God made the Sun and Moon, Bea&s;t, Fi&s;h, Fowl, Trees, Herbs,</HI> and ever Thing el&s;e. They &s;till continu'd the fir&s;t Objection; and, as they thought, with more Rea&s;on than before. <Q>&startq;For, <HI>&s;aid one of them,</HI> if you have a better Way of keeping the Memory of Things than we, yet I am &s;ure, you can't have the Know|ledge of what was done, before there was any Man made to &s;ee it.&endq;</Q> To this I re|ply'd, <Q>&startq;That God had reveal'd the Know|ledge of this, and a great deal more to &s;ome particular Per&s;ons:&endq;</Q> Which they glad|ly attending to hear, I went on to the <HI>Crea|tion of Man,</HI> and then of the <HI>Woman's being made out of a Rib, which God took from him while h$ was a&s;leep.</HI> At this they all broke
<PB N="187" REF="206">
out into Amazement and Laughter, and <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> &s;aid, <Q>&startq;It was a plain Untruth; and that it was a Shame to tell it with a &s;erious Countenance; by this, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he knew all the re&s;t was fal&s;e, for if this was true, a Woman would have a Rib more than a Man, and a Man want one on one Side, and have fewer than on the other.&endq;</Q> Here I committed a great Error thro' Igno|rance, which, however, I can't help confe&s;&s;ing; I hope, our Divines, and all good Chri&s;tians will con&s;ider the Circum&s;tances I was in, and forgive me: For I had no more Wit, than to in&s;i&s;t on the Truth of it; and affirm what I had heard, when a Child, from ignorant Per|&s;ons, <Q>&startq;That a Man had one Rib le&s;s on one Side than the other;&endq;</Q> and I had A&s;&s;urance enough to put the whole Argument upon this I&s;&s;ue, and offer'd to lay my Life as a Wager on it. The Prince laugh'd at me, and refus'd my Wager; but we had two Women with us, one was very lean, whom they call'd, and told her Ribs, finding them equal; and then a Man, and found the &s;ame: But they were not all of them convinc'd of the true Num|ber, not perfectly &s;atisfying them&s;elves, nor could I my&s;elf, in attempting to count them after them. From this Time, I perceiv'd, <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> treated all I &s;aid on Reli|gon with Contempt, and immediately re&s;um'd
<PB N="188" REF="207">
his former Objection with more Vigour, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;That to talk what was done before Man was made was &s;illy; and that what I &s;aid of God's talking with Men, and tell|ing them &s;uch Things had no Proof; and the Things I pretended to know, and talk of, were only old Womens Stories. How|ever, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> go on, and give us &s;ome fur|ther Account of this God of yours, who for|merly talk'd with Men.&endq;</Q> Then I went on with the Scripture Story of <HI>God's Wrath, and the Flood, which de&s;troy'd all Men and Bea&s;ts on the Earth, but tho&s;e in the Ark; and of</HI> Noah<HI>'s taking Male and Female of every Kind to pre|&s;erve them.</HI> Here another objected, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;If they had been all de&s;troy'd, could not God, who made them at fir&s;t, make more at his Plea&s;ure?&endq;</Q> But I went on, and told them of the <HI>Rainbow;</HI> and that it was made as <HI>a Sign to &s;ignify that the World &s;hould never be drowned again. Deaan Murnanzack</HI> objected, <Q>&startq;That they had no Memory of any &s;uch Thing deliver'd to them from their Fore|fathers; be&s;ides, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if none but <HI>Noah,</HI> with his Sons and Daughters were &s;av'd, pray was <HI>Noah</HI> a white Man, or a black Man?&endq;</Q> To which I an&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;Sir, I per|ceive you give no Credit to what I &s;ay of this Nature.&endq;</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;There are a great many Things which I don't know,
<PB N="189" REF="208">
and &s;hall be glad to be inform'd of; and would give Credit to any Thing, that a rea&s;onable Man can give Credit to; but mo&s;t of the&s;e Things are nothing but old Womens Stories; and I am &s;ure all white Men will not talk as you do.&endq;</Q> The&s;e were his very Words, which he repeated &s;everal Times, and was the Conclu&s;ion of the Argument, and the Evening's Conference. It was no &s;mall Trou|ble to me, to find how the Truth &s;uffer'd by my Weakne&s;s; but I was in &s;ome Hope, that <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> who was a Man of great Under&s;tanding, might con&s;ider that I was but a Child when I left <HI>England,</HI> and therefore, not well acquainted with the Things I under|took to inform them of.</P>
<P>THE next Day we went forward directly, for we were now pa&s;t all the wild Cattle; and therefore, <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> ha&s;ten'd homeward. About the Middle of the After|noon, we came to a Place where the Road divided; here the Prince halted, as I found, on Purpo&s;e to take his Leave of me, order|ing two Men to conduct me, and my Cattle, to his Cow-keeper. Here we parted, and we laid that Night near the Banks of a River, which bounds <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Country, and runs into <HI>Madamvovo,</HI> the great River, which pa&s;&s;es thorow <HI>Anterndroea.</HI> To this Place, where I was going, all the Cattle come
<PB N="190" REF="209">
to Water. As we pa&s;s'd thorow the Woods, we met a Company of Men and Women go|ing to fetch Water; they &s;top'd, and gaz'd at me with Wonder, having never &s;een a white Man; asking the Men who accompa|ny'd me, What I was? and Where I came from? who rogui&s;hly told them, <Q>&startq;They found me in the Fore&s;t among the wild Cattle, and were going to pre&s;ent me to the Prince.&endq;</Q> I, to carry on the Je&s;t, ran toward the Women, &s;peaking &s;ome gibberi&s;h, and frighted one of them into Fits; in&s;o|much that the re&s;t had much a-do to reco|ver her; for which I was afterwards very &s;orry.</P>
<P>THIS Wood reach'd from the River about &s;even Miles, without any Break, or Plain, till within a Mile of the Town. I was concern'd to think, what a great Way I had to drive my Cattle to Water every other Day; but it prov'd better than I expected, for there be|ing eight or ten of us, we took it by Turns; &s;o that it did not come to each one's Turn above once in &s;ixteen or twenty Days: Then there being no Gra&s;s by the Way, there was no Hindrance; and when they return'd hun|gry, they would go home fa&s;t enough.</P>
<P>THE People here had never &s;een a white Man before, &s;o that I was a very &s;urpri&s;ing Sight to them at fir&s;t; but they were &s;oon
<PB N="191" REF="210">
acquainted with me, and I became very &s;er|viceable: For whenever they had an Ox to kill, they were forc'd to go a great Way for one of the Royal Family; this Trouble I now &s;av'd them, and liv'd well my&s;elf by it. I was frequently &s;ent for on the&s;e Occa|&s;ions, and had always my Fee, which was four or five Ribs to carry home with me; be&s;ides the Leg roa&s;ted for my Entertaiment there. I &s;eldom went without a Boy to at|tend me, there being always &s;ome ready; be|cau&s;e I was able to gratify them with &s;ome of my Beef. I had al&s;o enough to live like other People, who are very free and gene|rous, in communicating &s;omething of what|ever they have to their Neighbours: When I came home with my Beef, I us'd to &s;et on the Pot, and &s;end Me&s;&s;es out to all my Neigh|bours; which they did not fail to return, whenever it was in their Power: And it may be ob&s;erv'd in the whole Cour&s;e of this Hi|&s;tory, that all the People of this I&s;land de|light in this free, and good-natur'd Manner of Living.</P>
<P>WHEN I was &s;ent for, the Hou&s;e was al|ways put in Order, the <HI>Owley</HI> dre&s;s'd, and plac'd in View; I was often employ'd&punc; to kill a Sacrifice, as in Ca&s;e of a Circumci&s;ion, or a Per&s;on's being &s;ick; and &s;ince I had the afore-recited Conference with <HI>Deaan Murnan|zack,</HI>
<PB N="192" REF="211">
I us'd out of Curio&s;ity to li&s;ten to the$t Prayers; and once or twice I attempted to talk of the Chri&s;tian Religion. When I men|tion'd the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Body,</HI> they told me, <Q>&startq;It mu&s;t be a Lye; and to talk to them of <HI>burning in Fire after this Life</HI> was abomi|nable: For, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> no Man can feel af|ter he is dead, and except we can &s;ee Peo|ple rais'd from Death, we will not give Credit to it.&endq;</Q> I attempted to tell them of <HI>God's Appearing</HI> and <HI>Giving the Ten Commandments,</HI> but &s;oon found it &s;ignify'd nothing; for they have the Purport and Meaning of all of them by Nature.</P>
<P>HERE are Laws again&s;t <HI>Adultery, Theft</HI> and <HI>Murder;</HI> and they have &s;uch an E&s;teem for their Parents, that they regard, and honour them even after Death; and there is al&s;o a Fine inflicted on a Man, who &s;hall cur&s;e ano|ther Man's Parents. They never &s;wear pro|fanely, but the&s;e Things they do, <Q>&startq;becau&s;e, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> it is convenient and proper; and we could not live one by another, if there were not &s;uch Laws; and therefore, there was no Occa&s;ion for the Great God to &s;peak the&s;e Things.&endq;</Q> The <HI>Fourth Commandment,</HI> indeed, they do not &s;eem to have any Notion of, except that they allow their Slaves one Day for them&s;elves; but they have no religious Duties to perform. And when I us&punc;d to tell
<PB N="193" REF="212">
them, that we kept it holy, becau&s;e <HI>God re&s;ted on it.</HI> They &s;aid, <Q>&startq;This was like the re&s;t; and <HI>ask'd,</HI> How I could tell what God did before there was any M$n?&endq;</Q> And indeed, I found my&s;elf &s;en&s;ibly grow into Contempt with them, for talking of the&s;e Things, and was likely to get the Reputation of a common, idle Liar; &s;o that I was forc'd to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, I had no Way to prove any Thing I &s;aid, and that Failure of the <HI>Rib</HI> in my Con|ver&s;ation with <HI>Deaan Murnanzack,</HI> was a mor|tifying Stroak to me; and tho' I, at fir&s;t, thought my ill Succe&s;s in the Argument was owing to my own Ignorance, yet I have had a great many &s;crupulous Thoughts ari&s;e in my Mind &s;ince; and &s;ure I am, that all was not owing to my Weakne&s;s, for our Divi$es have not furni&s;h'd us with Arguments &s;trong enough&punc; And I don't know, but they would be hard put to it to prove tho&s;e Things them&s;elves to the&s;e People, &s;ince Miracles are ceas'd. Neither do I know what Miracle could be $ow wrought, to prove what was done before any M$n was born. They are, here, Fools enough to be impos'd on by the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ees,</HI> or Conjurors; who, they think, do &s;trange Things; yet they don't imagine, that they conver&s;e with the Great God. They think, indeed, that there are Spirits, which may be good or bad, who come in Dreams, and tell the&s;e <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ees</HI> many Things; yet
<PB N="194" REF="213">
they do not take them to be more pious, or better Men than others, tho' they imagine them to be more knowing. However, the Awe, which my Education had fix'd on me, kept me from joining in any of their Wor&s;hip, for Fear it &s;hould be Idolatry; and here was no &s;uch Thing as Per&s;ecution for Religion ever thought of among them; &s;o that I was en|tirely to think, and do as I pleas'd, &s;o long as I did not affront them. I have not forgot <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s threatning to kill me at fir&s;t, but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, there was nothing in that, but a Pride and Ill-nature peculiar to him&s;elf; as appear'd by <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI>'s hin|dring him, and reconciling us, without obli|ging me to join in the Ceremony.</P>
<P>I had not liv'd here above &s;ix Weeks, be|fore I heard that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> had attack'd <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI>'s Town, and burnt it, killing two Men, and taking &s;ome of their Wives and Children captive, with almo&s;t all their Cattle. I was very much concern'd at this News, not|with&s;tanding that <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> had &s;everal Times in Pa&s;&s;ion attempted to kill me; yet living &s;o long in his Family, I could not but be affected with their Misfortunes. We us'd to have here a great Deal of flying News re|lating to their Wars; one Day an Account of a Battle fought, and the next Day a Contra|diction of it; their Reports being ju&s;t as much
<PB N="195" REF="214">
to be rely'd on, as &s;ome of our common News&punc; apers at <HI>London;</HI> &s;o that I did not regard hem. Be&s;ides, we liv'd here at a Di&s;tance $ Peace and Plenty, and might, perhaps, hear ow and then of the Lo&s;&s;es, which our Friends $&s;tain'd; but feeling none of the Mi&s;eries our|$lves, they &s;erv'd us only for Conver&s;ation; $ which, we, like <HI>Coffee-hou&s;e</HI> Politicians, &s;leep|$g in Security remote from Danger, cen&s;ur'd he Conduct of our Superiors, according to our $veral factious Inclinations, for Things we new little or nothing of, or at mo&s;t, but by $eirexternal Appearances; and tho&s;e too from ncertain Reports: Our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to make ur Lives as ea&s;y and happy as our Circum|ances would admit of; and among the many $hings we found to divert our&s;elves with, $e, I think, will bear relating; which, was $word$ Project of my Governor's, and prov'd as $ofitable as plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>THERE are in the remote Parts of this ountry &s;ome People, who&s;e Habitations are $word$ &s;ecret Places in the Woods; they live ea|$ indolent Lives, never coming near Towns, $r concerning them&s;elves with any Affairs f Peace or War, foreign, or dome&s;tick: $hey keep no Cattle, le&s;t their Bellowing ight betray them, and their Value induce me evil-minded Men to di&s;turb their Peace $ robbing them; but content them&s;elves with

&s;mall Plantations, and what Nature produ|ces; which is indeed &s;ufficient. They never trouble them&s;elves, who is Lord of any par|ticular Place, or King of the whole. <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Cow-keeper, who was my Go|vernor, had in the former Part of his Time liv'd on this Manner, and was, therefore, ac|quainted with &s;ome of their private Settle|ments; he conceiv'd that I, being a Man of a &s;ingular Colour, might be impos'd on them for a Prince of <HI>Murnanzack</HI>'s Family, they be|ing very ignorant; and yet not more &s;o than &s;ome vulgar People in <HI>Europe,</HI> who imagine that their Princes are &s;omething more Excellent, o$ Extraordinary in their Make, or Shape, from the re&s;t of Mankind. In &s;hort, the Bu&s;ine&s;s was agreed on, I was to have one Third of what Pre&s;ents we &s;hould get, he another, and the Per&s;ons who compos'd my Retinue the other Third. They procur'd me a fine &s;ilk Lam|ber, two, or three Strings of gawdy Beads for a Necklace, and a Gun to carry on my Shoulder; my Name on this Occa&s;ion was <HI>Rer Mimebolambo,</HI> who living the furthe&s;t off, there was the le&s;s Hazard of a Di&s;covery; &s;ince no Man among them had ever &s;een any of the Family in their Lives. Twenty Men of our Neighbours were my Attendants, and we practis'd three or four Days before we went, they waiting on me, and calling me by that
<PB N="197" REF="216">
Name and Title, that every Man might be perfect in the Part he had to act.</P>
<P>AT length we &s;et out, and made a very grand and formal March, with Shells blow|ing in the Rear, as is the Cu&s;tom: We had about ten, or a dozen Miles to the Place, when we came within half a Mile, my Go|vernor, and one to attend him, went before to acquaint them, that <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s younge&s;t Brother, <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> was pa&s;&s;ing this Way, and under&s;tanding there were Peo|ple hereabouts, de&s;ir'd they would &s;pare him &s;ome Provi&s;ions for him&s;elf and Retinue. We halted till we thought he had deliver'd his Me&s;&s;age, and prepar'd them; then we march'd on in Form and Order: When we came into their little Village, I found the Mat &s;pread for me to &s;it down upon, and all of them, Men, Women, and Children crawling upon their Hands and Knees to lick my Feet. My own People acted their Parts exactly, &s;hew|ing me the &s;ame Honour as was due to the Per&s;on I repre&s;ented; for I was no &s;ooner &s;at down, than one ran to fetch Water, while another brought a Callaba&s;h to receive it, and held for a third, who wa&s;h'd my Feet. I order'd my chief Man (who was in Reality my Governor) to procure a Hou&s;e for me; there were but five in the Place be&s;ides a few Huts for their Children. He pitch'd on one
<PB N="198" REF="217">
of the be&s;t, and left the Owner to &s;hift for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THEY &s;tood in Admiration, having never &s;een any One command with &s;uch Authority in their Lives. The Chief call'd the re&s;t to him, and con&s;ulted what Pre&s;ent was proper to make &s;uitable to my Dignity. Some of them return'd in a &s;hort Time, bringing &s;everal Gallons of <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn, and more of Carra|vances; but the old Man did not come him|&s;elf till near Evening, when he brought four Men loaded; two with as much Honey as they could well carry, and two with as much Carravances; which were plac'd before me. The old Man &s;at down at a Di&s;tance, and &s;urpriz'd with Awe, in a trembling Tone told me, <Q>&startq;He hop'd I would accept his &s;mall Pre&s;ent; that he had no more to command on this &s;hort Notice.&endq;</Q> I pity'd the poor Wretch, and chear'd him up, telling him, <Q>&startq;&endq;I was well pleas'd; that this was &s;ufficient, and more than I expected from him;</Q> defiring him to &s;it, and bear me Company, while my People went to &s;ome of his Neighbours; for I &s;ent them out &s;ome one Way, and &s;ome another, to get what they could: And what|ever the People could &s;pare, $ particularly order'd, they &s;hould bring them&s;elves, and ta&s;te it; le&s;t it &s;hould be damag'd by the Charms of the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee.</HI> The old Man reco|ver'd
<PB N="199" REF="218">
his Spirits in Time, and began to talk very freely; &s;aying, <Q>&startq;It was no Wonder, that my Father and Brethren rul'd over them; for God and the <HI>Daemons</HI> had made a Di&s;tinction in us from other Men: And if I had, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> met you in a Wood alone, I &s;hould have fallen down, and paid my Duty to you; for &s;urely, the <HI>Varzachars</HI> (or White-men) cannot be whiter than this young Prince is.&endq;</Q> Thus he run on, de&s;cribing all my Features, and prai&s;ing me in his Manner; for his Tongue was &s;et on running, and I could not tell what to &s;ay to him, nor when he would &s;top; but as Luck would have it, a &s;harp Man of my Retinue came in, and in a drolling Manner an&s;wer'd him, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;&endq;I don't wonder, old Father, that you are &s;urpris'd at the different Co|lour, excellent Features, and Make of the Prince; but you mu&s;t con&s;ider, my good old Man, that God has not made us equal; but he is pleas'd to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e whom he de&s;igns for the Government of Man|kind, by making them in &s;uch particular Form and Colour, that no Man can be ig|norant of their Superiority: For if all were of the &s;ame Shape and Colour, People would choo&s;e one from among them&s;elves, whom they thought mo&s;t wi&s;e and valiant, to be their Lord, King, and Commander; and
<PB N="200" REF="219">
if they did not like him, perhaps, they would go from him, and live under ano|ther, or choo&s;e another from among&s;t them|&s;elves; but if God has made any particu|lar Man, or Family for Princes, and has ordain'd that they &s;hall be Lords and Ma|&s;ters of all Mankind, You may be &s;ure he has made them more excellent for Beauty, and has given them &s;uch Marks, as every Man who &s;ees them mu&s;t know them by; and immediately fall down, and acknowledge their divine Right, Authority, and Power over them. Ay, ay, <HI>&s;ays the old Man,</HI> it is true, as you &s;ay; for I remember my Father went once in two or three Years, to carry Honey to <HI>Deaan Mernindgarevo,</HI> who was <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Father; and, <HI>they &s;ay,</HI> he was of a Copper Colour; but his Hair was black like ours. Yes, <HI>&s;ays the other,</HI> he was a little different, and not much; but <HI>Deaan Mungaz$ungarevo,</HI> which was this Prince's Father, marry'd a Woman from <HI>Port Dauphine;</HI> and it is &s;aid, &s;he was a white Man's Daughter. Yes, yes, <HI>&s;ays the old Man,</HI> there's &s;omething in that, in|deed; but I don't under&s;tand the&s;e Marks you mention of God's making in Princes. Pray, are all Princes of his fine Colour and Make&punc; And has God mark'd them all for Kings? I can't &s;ay, <HI>&s;ays the other,</HI> but this
<PB N="201" REF="220">
is the white&s;t.</Q>&mdash;In the Interim, as I began to be tyr'd with the Dialogue, came &s;ome of the People, who were &s;ent for, bring|ing their Pre&s;ents, and licking my Feet; and &s;o broke off the Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I found that my People had rogui&s;hly plot|ted this Drollery among&s;t them&s;elves to de|ceive the&s;e poor Pea&s;ants, and carry'd it on with admirable Ingenuity and Succe&s;s; for as they told me, one of the&s;e la&s;t ask'd how he &s;hould know who to pay his Re&s;pects to? and was roundly an&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;Do you think God has not di&s;tingui&s;h'd Princes from o|ther Men; you will &s;oon know him by his excellent Colour and Form.&endq;</Q> But I doubt, I have tyr'd my Reader with the long Tale of this Farce: In &s;hort, we got well by it; we had de&s;ign'd to have proceeded further into the Country; but were &s;o well provided with all we wanted, that we had no Occa&s;ion for any more; every Man having as much as he could carry: So the next Day they made up their <HI>Enters,</HI> all except my&s;elf, who kept my State. When we came home, we di|vided it according to Agreement; and after I had &s;ent Pre&s;ents to my Neighbours, I had enough for, two or three Months.</P>
<P>THIS was too happy a Life, for my adver&s;e Fate to &s;uffer me to continue long in: For before a Year came about, I was order'd home

again with my Cattle; three Men being &s;ent by <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> to conduct me. The Civil War had now been a Year and half, which reduc'd every On$ to great Straits; &s;o that they wanted the&s;e Catrle to live on, the re&s;t being con&s;um'd by them&s;elves, or taken by the Enemy; their Enemies al&s;o being in as bad Circum&s;tances, or wor&s;e. We return'd the &s;ame Way I came, thorow the Fore&s;ts of wild Cattle, and hunted as we went, till we arriv'd at <HI>Deaan Afferer</HI>'s Town on <HI>Yong-gorvo.</HI> I was very melancholy all the Way, and here began fir&s;t to think of making my E&s;cape to &s;ome Sea-Port Town at the Hazard of my Life; tho' it was a long Time before I had an Opportunity to effect it. When I arriv'd at <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI>'s Town, where my Ma&s;ter and his People &s;till liv'd, I found none but dull Countenances, yet they were glad at my &s;afe Arrival, being hereby richer than their Neigh|bours, whether Friends or Enemies; for my Cattle were increas'd. They thank'd me for my Care, which was all the Pay I got, and my Ma&s;ter was too &s;urly to do that; but my butchering Office brought me the u&s;ual Fees; by which Means I liv'd as well as others.</P>
<P>MY Bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;till to follow the Cow-Tail for the whole Town, no Body being willing to tru&s;t their Children, or Servants;

and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> dur&s;t not peremptorily command, even his own young Slaves, to any Thing which might hazard their being taken by the Enemy; le&s;t their Parents and Friends &s;hould re&s;ent it, and leave him to&punc; go, and live under other Lords. As for their white Slave, he had no Parents, nor Relations, to lament his Lo&s;s, if kill'd, or taken; and, therefore, the only fit Per&s;on to be expos'd to Dan|ger.</P>
<P>THE War was not carried on &s;o hotly as at fir&s;t, for their Courage was cool'd on all Sides; nor was there &s;o much to be got by plundering one another, as at the Beginning; but it was not long before our original Ene|mies, <HI>Chahary</HI> and <HI>Frukey,</HI> heard we had Cat|tle, and one Day, as I was tending them at &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Town, they came with two hundred Men, &s;urpris'd, and took the Cattle, and pur&s;u'd me in a mo&s;t furious Man|ner with a &s;avage yelling, firing, and throw|ing Lances, calling out, <HI>Kill him, cut him to pieces,</HI> &amp;c. but I got the Start of them, and fled into a Thicket &s;o full of Prickles and &s;trong great Thorns, that my Fle&s;h was mi|&s;erably torn from Head to Foot; neverthe|le&s;s I hid my&s;elf in the Mid&s;t of it: They &s;till follow'd me with their bruiti&s;h Cries, be|ginning to cut a Pa&s;&s;age to come at me; but ju&s;t as I had giv'n up my&s;elf for lo&s;t, of a

I was &s;ome Time before I could under|&s;tand the Meaning, till at length I found our People had heard the Uproar, and came up|on them: So that they had now as much as they could do to &s;ave their own Lives. They could not drive off the Bea&s;ts, but re&s;olving to do all the Mi&s;chief they could, they kill'd and wounded every one of them, and then fled. I was forc'd to keep my Station, and was not without Fear &s;ome of them would be driven upon me; till I perceiv'd by the Noi&s;e of the Guns, that they went further off; I then crept out, and found one of their chief Men fallen, and wounded, with two Lan|ces in his Hand. He look'd me full in the Face with his Eyes dazling, and was going to &s;peak, when I &s;natch'd one of his Lances out of his Hand, telling him, it was my Time now, and he was doubly my Enemy, and im|mediately &s;truck him dead. When our People &s;aw me, they thought, I was cut with Lan|ces; for I was all over bloody, and had &s;e|veral large Rents in my Fle&s;h, my Feet al|mo&s;t cut to Pieces, and many large Thorns yet &s;ticking in me: So that when I came to recover from the Fright, and to be cool, I was in great Pain. The Women and Chil|dren &s;oon came to help carry the &s;lain Cat|tle into Town; there not being above fif|teen

While the&s;e were bu&s;y with the Bea&s;ts, I told <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> that I took two Lances from a Man, who was grievou&s;ly wounded; but alive at the Side of the Thicket. I dur&s;t not tell them I kill'd him, for he had near Relations among our People, and I did not know, but they might privately revenge his Death on me; for they griev'd at it, and begg'd his Body to bury; which was granted.</P>
<P>WHEN I came Home, my Mi&s;tre&s;s very compa&s;&s;ionately order'd, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted a Slave to wa&s;h, and dre&s;s my Wounds, and pull out the Thorns. It was many Days before I was well, and I was not a little glad, I had no more Cattle to look after; notwith&s;tanding the Want, which, I knew, mu&s;t immediately follow. However, for a few Days we had Beef enough, and more than we could well di&s;pence with, while it was &s;weet.</P>
<P>BY that Time I was got well, my Ma&s;ter found another Employment for me, which was to go into the Woods to dig wild Yams for him, and his Wife; the Beef was now con&s;um'd, and there was &s;carce any Thing el&s;e to be found hereabouts to live on, and now we &s;everely felt the Mi&s;eries of a Civil War. I went a great Way &s;ometimes, before I could find enow of the&s;e for my Ma&s;ter and &s;elf, being &s;eldom able to bring home &s;ufficient to

<P>ONE Morning ju&s;t at Sun-ri&s;ing (for I have Rea&s;on to remember it) my Ma&s;ter, and &s;ome of the Chiefs were &s;itting in the Gate of the Town, and reflecting on their Poverty and Mis|fortunes, <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> &s;aid he had ta&s;ted no Beef a great While, and ask'd if they knew of any Body who had Cattle. They told him none of his, or <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI>'s People; but there was a Man in <HI>Deaan Mephontey</HI>'s Juri&s;|diction, about four or five Miles off, who had &s;ome good Beeves. He immediately calls a Man, and me, near to him, and told us, we mu&s;t go, and bring away privately one of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts, bidding us to choo&s;e a fat One.

He, perceiving he had not kill'd me, took up two Lances, and before the People could &s;top his Hand, he threw one at me. He rav'd, and call'd me an hundred vile Names; as for &s;wear|ing, they know nothing of it: At length he was pacify'd, and on my Submi&s;&s;ion, and the Intreaty of his Friends, he forgave me; but in&s;i&s;ted on my going. There being no Reme|dy, I proceeded on the De&s;ign with the Man, tho' with many Lamentations at my hard For|tune, and wretched Slavery.</P>

The Meat was divided into two hundred Pieces, and di&s;tributed to as many People.

<P>IT was now Winter, and the Yams could not &s;o ea&s;ily be found, the Stalks being &s;o wither'd; that we were reduc'd to mi&s;erable Want, and almo&s;t fami&s;h'd: If we could eat once a Day, it was luxurious Living; in&s;o|much that when the Children cry'd for Food, tho' they had none all Day, their Mothers could with Authority &s;nap &s;hort at them; and

<P>IT was with &s;ome Reluctancy, that this Prince li&s;ten'd to Peace; for his Uncle's Be|haviour, and that of his Sons was &s;o inhu|man and &s;avage, in de&s;troying the Cattle of Relations and Country-men, rooting up the Plantations, and other gro&s;s Inhumanites; that he almo&s;t forgot his private Wrongs, and look'd on <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> as the general Enemy of Mankind; who, to gratify his bru|ti&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion, endeavour'd to bring about irre|parable De&s;olation and univer&s;al De&s;truction; notwith&s;tanding the Examples he him&s;elf had &s;hewn at the fir&s;t breaking out of the Quar|rels: With what admirable Genero&s;ity did he treat both <HI>Crindo</HI> and <HI>Mundumber,</HI> their Peo|ple, Towns, and Effects? plainly &s;hewing that he aim'd at nothing, but doing him&s;elf Ju&s;tice, and deciding a Controver&s;y; and that the mur|dering of Men, and ruining of Countries were abominable: Aad as <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> told me, it was his Piety at la&s;t determin'd him to a Recon|ciliation; for he thought God could never

look favourably on a Man, who would re|fu&s;e to relieve Mankind from &s;uch Mi&s;eries, as his Country-men then &s;uffer'd; and This only mov'd him, in the Height of Succe&s;s, to wave the Pro&s;ecution of his own Intere&s;t, when it &s;tood in Competition with the pub|lick Good. The&s;e were the pious Re&s;olu|tions of this great Man, notwith&s;tanding the Laugh he made of Reveal'd Religion; or, at lea&s;t, of my Manner of attempting to teach it him. I wi&s;h, that our Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts, who build &s;o much on a more than ordi|nary Knowledge of God's Will, would make their Lives Examples, as his was; and teach Princes, and others too, to be in Reality &s;o truly ju&s;t, honourable, and good as this gal|lant black Prince was in all his Actions; and yet I que&s;tion not, but he mu&s;t be call'd an illiterate Heathen.</P>

<P>WHILE <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> was delivering his fir&s;t Speech to <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mevar|row,</HI> I ob&s;erv'd him to fix his Eye upon me, and when he had done, he look'd at me with Concern in his Face; and calling to me in broken Engli&s;h, <HI>You, white Man, come hither&punc;</HI> He ask'd me my Name, then turning to my Ma&s;ter, &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;Here's a white Bird among Crows, in our Country they are common, Ships coming there frequently; but they wear Cloaths, eat, and drink with the Lords&punc; This poor young Man looks piteou&s;ly, why do you let him go without Cloaths?

<P>I could not forbear li&s;tning to this Di&s;|cour&s;e with the greate&s;t Attention, and wanted an Opportunity to talk privately with him, which I did at Night; for he brought &s;ome Cattle, which <HI>Murnanzack</HI> had giv'n him, know|ing we had none; and I was &s;ent for to kill a Bullock. By this Means I had an Opportunity to tell him in broken Engli&s;h, <HI>That I would come, and &s;ee him at Night.</HI> Accordingly I went, and he receiv'd me with great Civility: After we were &s;at, he enquir'd into the whole Hi&s;tory of our Shipwreck and Misfortune. I gave him a full Account thereof, as al&s;o of my Ma&s;ter's cruel U&s;age, and my mi&s;erable Slavery. The Relation of my wretched Ca&s;e made me weep, and drew Tears from his Eyes. He told me, he would endeavour to buy me of <HI>Deaan Me|varrow,</HI> and comforted me as well as he could.

<P>AFTER I &s;at down as u&s;ual, he told me, he was glad to &s;ee me again; and ask'd what Succe&s;s I had, which I told him; as al&s;o that my Ma&s;ter had greatly abus'd me for bringing no more Yams. He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;I was the fir&s;t white Man he ever &s;aw, who had a black Man for his Ma&s;ter; and tho' he could not buy me, yet he did not doubt, but <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> would find &s;ome Way to get me into <HI>Feraingher;</HI> when he came next Sum|mer toward this Country."

When I con&s;ider'd on what had pa&s;s'd, I began to have quite diffe|rent Thoughts, as if I had been in another Country; for I found here were a great many People, and Nations too, who under&s;tood Hu|manity; but it was my Misfortune to hap|pen

The next Command was to attend, and receive Axes and Hoes to pre|pare the Ground for planting. Some clear'd it of the Wood and Briars, while others ho'd it up in&s;tead of Plowing: Our Ma&s;ter &s;ent to his Uncle <HI>Mephontey</HI> for <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn and Carravances, which were &s;oon &s;ow'd; and then gave his Slaves a Fortnight's Time to make their own Plantations. I was forc'd to de&s;ire <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> to beg my Ma&s;ter to give me two Days more to look after my Honey; which I had left &s;ecur'd from Thieves by the white Sticks, on Pretence of being poi&s;on'd by the Charm of the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee.</HI> He gave me Leave, and I took three large Tubs, each of which held five or &s;ix Gallons, and as many
<PB N="219" REF="238">
Callaba&s;hes. I had further to go than from our old Town, which was burnt; but when I came there, I found them as I left them, untouch'd; and the Honey prodigiou&s;ly en|creas'd. I &s;moak'd the Bees out, and took the greate&s;t Part of the Honey and Wax away, but not all, leaving them &s;ome to live on; for they will return to the Hives them&s;elves, and when they &s;warm, go to new Ones with|out any of that Trouble we have in <HI>England.</HI> I found &s;ome fine <HI>Virginia</HI> Honey with white Wax, which I put in my Callaba&s;hes: It being two Years &s;ince I had &s;een them, I had almo&s;t forgot where to look for &s;ome of them; for they were at a great Di&s;tance from one ano|ther, up and down in the Wood. However, I fill'd all my Ve&s;&s;els, and left as much more behind for another Journey. I had more now than I could carry Home at once, &s;o that I was oblig'd to return the next Day for it. When I had brought it Home, I went to my Ma|&s;ter, and pre&s;ented him with one of the Tubs: Now the&s;e Lords always expect a Pre&s;ent on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. When my Ma&s;ter &s;aw me bring &s;uch a large Tub-ful, he was &s;urpris'd; and ask'd me, <HI>Why I brought him &s;o much?</HI> For I mu&s;t do him the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay he was not covetous.</P>
<P>BESIDES, Here are no Officers to go about, and demand any certain Quantity; but the
<PB N="220" REF="239">
People mu&s;t go them&s;elves, and carry a Pre|&s;ent of whatever their Plantations and Indu|&s;try produce; as Carravances, <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn, Potatoes, &amp;c. but it is only as an Acknow|ledgment of Homage; and a Callaba&s;h would have been &s;ufficient for me: But I told him, I knew he had a Circumci&s;ion-Fea&s;t to make, and I had a great deal, and &s;o de&s;ir'd him to accept it. He told me, it was true; and for that U&s;e he would buy all the Honey I had to &s;pare, and give me a Cow and a Calf for it as &s;oon as he had &s;ome Cattle.</P>
<P>THE Civil War being over, we liv'd at Ea&s;e, could dig our wild Yams without Fear: People now went to and fro in the Country to vi&s;it one another, and every Body attended their Plantations; but it was &s;ix Months after this before we had Plenty. My Conver&s;ation with <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> was &s;till for ever in my Mind, and I wanted only an Opportunty of my Ma|&s;ter's going abroad on &s;ome Expedition, to execute my Re&s;olution of endeavouring to e&s;|cape. Nothing happen'd all this While, but there was one <HI>Rer Ambarroch,</HI> a petty Prince, to the Northward, who, a little before the Civil War began, had receiv'd, and detain'd eight Slaves of <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI>'s, and thirty Head of his Cattle; and when the <HI>Deaan</HI> &s;ent a &s;pecial Me&s;&s;enger to demand them, he re|turn'd for An&s;wer, <HI>That he might come him&s;elf,</HI>

<HI>and feteh them.</HI> He being now at Lei&s;ure, <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> and he agreed to join their For|ces, and having obtain'd Leave of <HI>Deaan Crin|do,</HI> they prepar'd to march. I expected to be left behind with my u&s;ual Charge of his Wife, and thought it would be a proper Opportunity for my De&s;ign; but &s;tanding before him with two Lances in my Hand, &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;You &s;hall not always live at Home like a Woman, you &s;hall go to the Wars with me; the Sight of a white Man arm'd will fright tho&s;e People in the Mountains where we are go|ing:&endq;</Q> So taking my two Lances away, <Q>&startq;Here, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> is one of your Grand-father's Arms, I &s;uppo&s;e, you can manage this bet|ter than ours; prepare your&s;elf for the March.&endq;</Q> I de&s;ir'd one of my Lances, which he gave me, and twenty Musket-Balls, &s;ome Powder, and two Flints. I took my Mat as u&s;ual, but my Ma&s;ter gave it to one of his Slaves to carry for me; &s;o I walk'd like a Gentleman without any Luggage.</P>
<P>OUR little Army con&s;i&s;ted of about three hundred Men be&s;ides Slaves: We went to the Northward all the fir&s;t Day, the &s;econd Day we got into the Fore&s;t to the Ea&s;t of <HI>Yong|gorvo,</HI> where the wild Cattle are, we hunted, and kill'd &s;ome Beef, while four Men were &s;ent out as Spies toward <HI>Rer Ambarroch</HI>'s Town, to &s;ee how it was fortify'd. We were almo&s;t

a Day's Journey from it; for it was not pro|per to go nearer, le&s;t &s;ome of their People &s;hould have di&s;cover'd us hunting, and alarm'd the Town; for they live chiefly on wild Cat|tle. Our Spies return'd, and brought Word that it was an open Place without any Fortifi|cation. We march'd all Night, and by Break of Day arriv'd at the Town, divided our&s;elves to &s;urround it, and fir'd into their Hou&s;es to rou&s;e them; the Barking of the Dogs and the Noi&s;e of the Guns &s;oon awaken'd them, and away they run; for we gave them no Time to mu&s;ter together: So we fell to plundering, and taking what Pri&s;oners we could get; I &s;aw the Prince's Hou&s;e, and ran directly toward it, hoping to take him Pri&s;oner; he jump'd out, and fir'd at me, I was going to return it, when a Man threw a Lance at me, which I put off, and fir'd at him, and &s;topp'd his Run|ning; but by this Means the Prince got off.</P>
<P>I enter'd the Hou&s;e, and found his Wife and Daughter &s;itting with two or three Slaves: I took hold of the Ladies Hands, and brought them both out, and let other People go in, and plunder the Hou&s;e as they pleas'd, for I had a good Prize; but one of <HI>Rer Mimebo|lambo</HI>'s Men, who had taking Nothing, would have took one of my Captives from me: I told him, I &s;uppos'd he was a Coward, and had &s;neak'd behind a Tree in the Action, or

el&s;e he might have taken &s;omething or other. He in&s;i&s;ted on it, and reproach'd me with be|ing a Slave, till &s;ome of our People came up, when he was &s;orc'd to depart with Shame; for a Complaint was made to <HI>Deaan Mevar|row,</HI> who ju&s;tify'd me, and &s;everely repri|manded the Man. Now an Agreement was made before we &s;et out, that the Cattle &s;hould be divided; but Captives &s;hould remain to tho&s;e who took them. When we had drove all the Men away, we got what Cattle we could find together, and ha&s;ten'd thorow the Wood with them, expecting that the Enemy would rally and attack us. When we got in|to the Plain, we halted, and made ready to receive them; they &s;oon came according to Expectation, as I &s;uppo&s;e, about two hun|dred.</P>
<P>I deliver'd my two Captives, as did every One el&s;e theirs to the Slaves in the Rear, while we march'd; and coming very near them, they al&s;o meeting us, we made a Di&s;|charge almo&s;t all at once, and kill'd them three or four Men. We halted a little to load again, and ob&s;erv'd them &s;tand amaz'd and daunted, looking more particularly on &s;ome one remarkable Per&s;on, who was fall'n; I being &s;oon loaded, and a few more ran di|rectly to them; they &s;eeing us come &s;o near, which is not u&s;ual, fir'd at us, and ran away:
<PB N="224" REF="244">
We follow'd them till they got into the Wood, and then return'd to the main Army. They came out of the Wood again on our Retreat, and follow'd us at a Di&s;tance, being willing to &s;ee the la&s;t of their Wives, Children and Cattle; and to ob&s;erve us, if any Accident &s;hould happen, which might give them an Advantage to recover them, or any Part of them.</P>
<P>AT Noon we halted near a Spring, in a &s;hady Grove, to refre&s;h our&s;elves; for we were fa&s;ting. My Ma&s;ter being &s;eated, call'd to me to bring my two Captives before him; and having commended me for my Behavi|our in the Action, he told me, I &s;hould keep one of them my&s;elf; and de&s;ir'd I would make my Choice, and he would have the other. I &s;oon determin'd for the young One, being in Truth, extremely pleas'd with her from the very Moment I took her. She was about &s;ix|teen Years of Age, her Mother was not a|bove four, or five and thirty; She I pre&s;ented to my Ma&s;ter. My Choice al&s;o pleas'd him, for he had a Mind to do a generous Action; &s;o calling her to him, he told her, <Q>&startq;Her Husband had brought all this upon him|&s;elf by his unju&s;t and churli&s;h Proceedings, and I have done no more than he bid me; I am come my&s;elf, and have fetch'd away all my Women; and I perceive &s;ome of my

And, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> he &s;hall &s;pill all the white Man's Blood before he &s;hall have her again.&endq;</Q> Af|ter &s;he had eaten &s;ome Meat, which <HI>Mevarrow</HI> gave her, &s;he came to me to take Leave of her Daughter. They both cry'd, not expect|ing ever to &s;ee each other again; I pity'd them heartily, and &s;hould have di&s;mis'd the young One; but to confe&s;s the Truth, I was downright in Love with her, having never be|fore &s;een any Woman I lik'd &s;o well; tho' I had been here &s;o many Years. However I com|forted the Mother as well as I could, and told her, <Q>&startq;Not to lament too much for her Daugh|ter, &s;he &s;hould live very well; I would take more Care of her than of my&s;elf, and tho' I was not a black Man, I had as tender a Heart as any black Man whatever, and de|&s;ign'd to make her my Wife, if &s;he lik'd it: If not, <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> I did not know whether &s;he would live &s;o ea&s;y a Life.&endq;</Q> Her Mother ask'd her, "What &s;he thought of that? <HI>She an&s;wer'd,</HI> <Q>&startq;She was at my Di&s;po&s;al, and not at

her own; and de&s;ir'd her Duty might be pre&s;ented to her Father: And mine too, if you plea&s;e, Mother, <HI>&s;aid I.&endq;</HI></Q> So after a little more Di&s;cour&s;e they parted. She took her Leave of <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> thanking him for his Civility, and went away by her&s;elf: But I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he had not far to go alone; they were, no doubt, as near as they dur&s;t come, in the Woods, ob&s;erving us, tho' we ne|ver &s;aw them any more; yet we kept a &s;trict Guard all Day, and the next Night. I was very careful of my pretty Pri&s;oner, tying a Rope about her Middle, with the Ends about my&s;elf, and laid her clo&s;e to me, holding her fa&s;t al&s;o in my Arms; &s;he only laugh'd, and je&s;ted with me for it, but I was &s;o fear|ful of her getting away, that I could not &s;leep. We march'd very &s;wiftly the next Day, and when we halted, <HI>Rer Mimebolambo</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> parted the Cattle, each had two hundred and eleven; and then they &s;eparated, taking the neare&s;t Way home.</P>
<P>JUST before we enter'd the Town, we halted again to divide the Cattle among our&s;elves; the <HI>Deaan</HI> had thirty, his Brother ten, each of the other Principals one; who&s;oever had two Slaves retain'd one of them, and deli|ver'd the other to their Lord, and had a Cow and Calf in&s;tead of it: If two Men got a Slave between them, they had each a Cow for it;
<PB N="227" REF="247">
every Man, who had not a Slave, was to have a Cow, if the Number would admit of it; if not, one between two. And this is a gene|ral, and fixed Law for dividing an Enemies Spoil.</P>
<P>MY Ma&s;ter told me I had but one Slave, I alledg'd he had taken one away, and might have kept it; but I found he was only in Je&s;t: For he gave me a Cow and a Calf for her whom he &s;ent away, and would have had me pick'd out another Cow and Calf for my Honey, which I refus'd; &s;o he cho&s;e them for me him&s;elf of the be&s;t of the Cattle. Thus I became rich at once, having two Cows and their Calves, and an hand&s;ome <HI>Zorzer Ampeller.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we came near the Gates of the Town the Shells were blown, and the Women came all running to &s;ee what was the Meaning of it, not expecting us &s;o &s;oon; but when they knew us, they ran back to their Hou&s;es till we enter'd in Triumph, and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> was &s;eated; then his Wife came out, and lick'd his Feet, and after her the re&s;t of the Women, and then each to her re&s;pective Husband. I thought I had now a Wife, and as fine a One too as the be&s;t of them, and the next Time we return'd from &s;uch an Expedition, I &s;hould have Homage done me. My Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ent, and de&s;ir'd to &s;ee my Lady, I went along with her; She would have her &s;et down on the &s;ame Mat with her&s;elf,
<PB N="228" REF="248">
and could not forbear &s;hedding Tears, it hav|ing been her own Ca&s;e, and charg'd me to u&s;e her tenderly. I &s;aid, I did not de&s;ign to make a Slave of her, but a <HI>Valle,</HI> or Wife.</P>
<P>I had a Stock of Honey, which I left with a Neighbour, as al&s;o Carravances; and having Milk from my Cows, I made a very tolerable Supper for my Bride, and my&s;elf; and was for|mal enough to mimick Matrimony as far as I could, by taking her by the Hand, and &s;aying, <HI>I was willing to make her a tender, and faith|ful Husband;</HI> and ask'd her, <HI>If &s;he was willing to be a faithful, and loving Wife;</HI> to which &s;he chearfully agreed: And &s;o we lay down, and were as happy as our Circum&s;tances would ad|mit of; notwith&s;tanding we had no Bride-Men and Maids, nor Throwing of Stockings.</P>
<P>SOME of my Readers will, perhaps, wonder how I could &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately love a black Wo|man; but let them con&s;ider, I had been &s;everal Years in the Country, and they were become natural to me. Then She was very hand&s;ome, of a middle Stature, &s;treight and exactly &s;hap'd, her Features regular, and her Skin &s;oft, fine, and delicate, as any Ladies in <HI>Europe.</HI> Indeed, all the Women are &s;oft and fine skinn'd, who are of any Rank, and carefully brought up.

Negroes. Their Cloathing is a Lamber much longer than the Mens, reaching to their Feet from their Middle; above it, and joining un|der the Lamber, is a Garment like a &s;treight Shift, covering all the Body to the Neck, and &s;hort Sleeves. This is commonly made of Cotton, and of a dark Colour; the Women of the better Sort adorn it with Beads very hand&s;omely, e&s;pecially on the Back; where they are rang'd in Rows, coming cro&s;s one a|nother; and being of different Colours, they make a large double Cro&s;s, &s;o like a Union-Flag, that One would imagine they copy'd it.</P>
<P>THUS much as to the De&s;cription of the Per&s;on and Habits of the&s;e Women; in which I will not pretend to prefer them to our <HI>Eu|ropeans:</HI> And yet notwith&s;tanding I have been &s;o long in <HI>England,</HI> I can't help confe&s;&s;ing, 'tis with Plea&s;ure I think of mine; and with Con|cern I remember our Parting: For as to their Fidelity, Behaviour to their Husbands, good|natur'd Di&s;po&s;itions and agreeable Conver&s;a|tion, &s;o far as their little Knowledge extends, I think the <HI>Europeans</HI> mu&s;t not compare with them. We white People have a very con|temptible, and mean Opinion of the&s;e Blacks; and a great One of our&s;elves. They al&s;o have a great Opinion of us, and think we excel them va&s;tly in Knowledge, Arts and Sciences; &s;o far they are right, but if an impartial Compa|ri&s;on

It will be remark'd, I dare &s;ay, that the be&s;t Character I could give my&s;elf to re|commend me to my Wife's Mother was, <HI>That I had as tender an Heart as a Black;</HI> for they, certainly, treat one another with more Hu|manity than we do. Here is no One mi&s;e|rable, if it is in the Power of his Neighbours to help him; here is Love, Tenderne&s;s, and Gener$&s;ity, which might &s;hame us; and Mo|ral Hone&s;ty too: And this not only ju&s;t in this one Country of <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> but all over the I&s;land; even in other Places more than here&punc; <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> may be alledg'd as an Excep|tion to this Moral Hone&s;ty, for his &s;tealing his Neighbours Cattle: This is true, but there will be bad Men in every Country; yet it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, he did it again&s;t Con&s;ci|ence, and was &s;elf-condemn'd; for he knew Ju&s;tice as well as any One, witne&s;s his Pay|ing me my Cow and Calf for my Honey; and many other Things.

MY Reader, I hope, will excu&s;e this Digre&s;|&s;ion, by remembring the only Plea&s;ure I had to alleviate the Mi&s;ery of my Slavery while in <HI>Anterndroea.</HI> I look'd after my Ma&s;ter's Cat|tle as before, but then I had &s;ome of my own, and an agreeable Companion to go Home to, who took Care to dre&s;s my Victuals; and hav|ing Plenty of Honey, I was never without Toak in the Hou&s;e, for my Wife and I to enjoy our&s;elves with, and entertain a Friend. So that I liv'd as well as any of my Neigh|bours, and being now le&s;s fatigu'd than for|merly, I was capable of taking more Notice than before, of the Religion and Laws of the Country: And as I am going to relate a Cir|cumci&s;ion Fea&s;t, it will not be improper to give fir&s;t an Account of the Religion, which is, indeed, but little.</P>
<P>THEY acknowledge, and adore the Only One Supreme God, whom they call <HI>Deaan &V;nghor|ray;</HI> which &s;ignifies the <HI>Lord Above:</HI> They &s;ay, there are four other Lords, each to his re&s;pective Quarter of the World, who&s;e Names are <HI>Deaan Antemoor,</HI> or the Northern Lord; <HI>Deaan Meguddummateme,</HI> the Southern Lord; <HI>Deaan Androwfertraer,</HI> the We&s;tern; and <HI>Deaan Anabele&s;hey,</HI> the Ea&s;tern: This la&s;t, they &s;ay, is the Di&s;pen&s;er of Plagues, and Mi&s;eries to Mankind, by the Permi&s;&s;ion or Command of the Great God; the Others al&s;o are $$e$$|tors
<PB N="232" REF="252">
of his Commands; but chiefly Di&s;pen&s;ers of Benefits. The&s;e four they look on as Me|diators between Men and the Great God; from whence they have a great Veneration for them, and recommend them&s;elves to them in their Prayers and Sacrifices.</P>
<P>I have already giv'n &s;ome Account of the <HI>Om|leys&punc;</HI> by which they &s;eem to have the &s;ame No|tion, as &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious People in <HI>Europe</HI> have formerly had of familiar Spirits; becau&s;e they &s;end them, as it were, on Me&s;&s;ages with their Prayers to the Great God; and expect them to come after a Sacrifice, and tell in Dreams what they have to do; and al&s;o warn them of Dangers. This agrees pretty near to the No|tion, which &s;ome Chri&s;tians have had of Guar|dian Angels; or &s;ome Philo&s;ophers of a good, and bad Genius; or rather is more exactly a|greeable to a very ancient, and long-received Opinion of <HI>Daemons;</HI> and therefore, not hav|ing any other Word &s;o fit in our Language, I choo&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h them by that; for <HI>Owley</HI> is no more than the general Name of the Uten|&s;il, or Altar; which is rather like a <HI>Tali&s;ma$,</HI> or <HI>Sigil,</HI> to which the <HI>Daemon</HI> is &s;uppos'd to be attach'd; and by which, as a proper <HI>Me|dium,</HI> they will be invok'd: For there are al|mo&s;t as many different <HI>Daemons</HI> with proper Names, as there are People who have <HI>Owleys</HI> Some of which are, <HI>Ry-Leffu, Tompack-Offnarev$,</HI>
<PB N="233" REF="253">
<HI>Lalla-petu, Deer-me&s;acker, Deer-hurzolavor, Ry|mungary, Ry-ove.</HI> Then they al&s;o invoke the Spirits of their Fore-fathers, and have a great Veneration for them; calling upon them by Names giv'n after their Decea&s;e: In&s;omuch that they account it a Crime to mention them by the Names they had when living; and this Name is chiefly known by the Word <HI>Garevo</HI> at the End of it; as may be ob&s;erv'd in the Names of <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s and <HI>Deaan Murnan|zack</HI>'s Fathers, when repeated by my Mock-Retinue among the Pea&s;ants.</P>
<P>THE Veneration they have for the Memory of their Fore-fathers, and the A&s;&s;urance they have of their Spirits always exi&s;ting, appears in every Circum&s;tance of the few religious Du|ties they perform: The Burial of the Dead is very &s;ingular, and &s;olemn. I have often taken Notice of the great Humanity, with which, on all Occa&s;ions, they treat each other in all Calamities and Misfortunes; &s;o al&s;o in Sick|ne&s;s they frequently vi&s;it, and contribute all they can to the Help of the afflicted Family, and Re&s;toration of the &s;ick Per&s;on. At a De|cea&s;e all the Relations and Neighbours come to the Hou&s;e, the Women lament, and the Men a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Preparations for the Funeral. The fir&s;t Thing is to pitch upon a Tree for the Coffin; then a Cow, or an Ox is kill'd, and &s;ome of the Blood &s;prinkl'd on it; pray|ing
<PB N="234" REF="254">
to their Fore-fathers, and the <HI>Daemons,</HI> and Demy Gods to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and take Care that the Tree &s;plit not in falling, nor that any Man be hurt by cutting, or felling it. After the Tree is down, they cut it about a Foot longer than the Corps, and &s;plit it downright Length-ways; (for they always choo&s;e a Tree which they know will &s;plit &s;o;) and dig both Parts hollow, making them like two Throughs. It is then fit to be carry'd to the Hou&s;e, the Corps being in the mean Time wa&s;h'd, and wrapp'd up in a Lamber, or perhaps, in two Lambers, and &s;ow'd fa&s;t There is all this While Frankincen&s;e, or a Gum very like it, burning in the Hou&s;e. They &s;eldom keep the Corps above one Day, e&s;pecially in hot Wea|ther. They put the Corps in the Troughs, clo&s;ing them together, and carry it on &s;ix Mens Shoulders. Every Family has a peculiar Bury|ing-place, which no other Per&s;on dur&s;t infringe upon, or break into; nor, indeed, does any Body attempt it. This is inclos'd, and fenc'd round with Sticks like Palli&s;adoes, when they come near the Place, the Corps is &s;et down without it, and they proceed to the re&s;t of the Ceremony; which is to make four Fires, one at each Corner on the Out-&s;ide of the Bu|rying-place: On the&s;e Fires they burn the Ox or Cow, which was before kill'd on Purpo&s;e, dividing it into Quarters, and con&s;uming it

how to turn to his Advantage: And when the trouble&s;ome Times came on, he would come frequently to <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> and tell him how an|gry <HI>Lulu-bay</HI> was, and what Misfortunes he threaten'd him with. Now, whether, as he was a cunning Man, he gue&s;s'd right from the Rea&s;on of Things, or, whether he dream'd right; for &s;ometimes, indeed, it happen'd, as he &s;aid; and often otherwi&s;e.

This open'd the Eyes of a great many more, but an Excu&s;e was at hand, <Q>&startq;That this Brother had neg|lected to &s;acrifice, and pray to <HI>Lulu-bay;</HI> and therefore, he &s;uffer'd him to fall.&endq;</Q> Yet <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> and &s;ome of the &s;illie&s;t of the People &s;till continu'd their &s;uper&s;titious Opi|nion of this Great Spirit, being afraid to &s;peak, or think any Thing contemptible of it; hav|ing always ready the Excu&s;e of mean-&s;pirited Bigots, <Q>&startq;That tho&s;e were &s;afer who paid a

a Butt, and &s;ome &s;maller; a Shed being built, and thatch'd over on purpo&s;e, to place them in.

When I came Home in the Evening I found the Town full of People, &s;ome wallowing on the Ground, and &s;ome &s;taggering; &s;carce any One &s;ober, either Men, Women, or Children: And here One might &s;en&s;ibly perceive the Ef|fects of Peace and Seeurity, People being wholly abandon'd to Drinking and Merry|making, without Fear or Care. My Wife, I perceiv'd, had been among them, but had the Prudence to retire Home in Time; for I found her cover'd up a&s;leep.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AND now the Day being come, I return'd from looking after my Cattle before Noon, to bring up the two Oxen, and a Bull; who&s;e Legs being immediately ty'd fa&s;t, they were thrown along on the Ground:

The Child was near a Year old, for they have no certain Time of doing it: He was was dre&s;s'd up with Beads, and a Skain of white Cotton-Thread on his Head.

Every One was &s;erv'd with a little Toak in a Callaba&s;h once only before the Ceremony. Things being now ready, they waited for the Signal from the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee,</HI> who was all this While mea&s;uring his Shadow with his Feet; and when it came to the Length of three and an half of his Feet, he gave the Word; Then a Principal of the near Relations, who had the Child in his Arms, ran with him to the Bull, and putting the Child's right Hand on the Bull's right Horn,</Q> &s;aid the&s;e Words,</P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IF the Bull roars while the Boy's Hand is on his Horn, they look on it as an unfor|tunate <HI>Omen</HI> of his being &s;ickly, or unhap|py in Life; and all the Bu&s;ine&s;s the <HI>&V;mo&s;|&s;ee</HI> has, is only &s;uch Super&s;tition as this, to tell them, <HI>When is the mo&s;t lucky Hour, or Minute, to do it in;</HI> like a Fortune-teller: But as to the religious Part of the Cere|mony, he has nothing to do with it. If there is any Religion intended by it, which is &s;ome Que&s;tion, for any experienc'd Man of the Neighbourhood, whom, they &s;uppo&s;e, be&s;t under&s;tands it, performs the Office, by feeling for the Head of the Yard, and cutting the Fore-skin off as clo&s;e as they can, two Men holding the Child's Legs and Arms: As to the Name, it's giv'n before, and often chang'd afterwards; this Child's was <HI>Ry-mocker.</HI> When the Fore-skin is cut off, a Man &s;tands ready with a Stick, like a Gun-Rammer, the big|ge&s;t End of which is cut pointed; on this he puts the Fore-skin, and going to the Wood, throws it to the Ea&s;tward. When the Ceremony is fini&s;h'd, the Child is de|liver'd to its Mother, who is all this While &s;itting on a Mat, and the Women round

Before they began to drink, he took Care to &s;ecure their Wea|pons, and no Man was &s;uffer'd to have ei|ther Gun or Lance; and then they went to boiling, broiling, and roa&s;ting of Meat, and drinking of Toak, &s;inging, hallowing, blowing of Shells, and drumming, as long as they were able. I don't think there were twenty &s;ober Per&s;ons among them. This continu'd all Night, &s;ome went away the next Morning; but mo&s;t &s;tay'd till Eve|ning:</Q> So that the Fea&s;t la&s;ted three Days.</P>
<P>THESE People are great Lovers of Toak; and &s;ome of the ordinary Fellows as great Sots as any in <HI>England,</HI> and as lazy; for they will &s;ell their <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn, Carravances, and even their very Spades and Shovels, and live on what the Woods afford; their Lambers too mu&s;t go for Toak, and make a very ordinary One &s;erve their Turn, ju&s;t to cover their Na|kedne&s;s. It is made of the <HI>Wooring,</HI> a Tree &s;o call'd; which they cut down with a Lance: The onter Bark they take away, and the in|ner, which is white, they peel off entire, and

beat with a Stick till 'tis &s;oft and pliable; and then it is fit to wear as a Lamber, but it can't be wa&s;h'd. The Lambers for the mo&s;t part are made of Cotton, dy'd in the Yarn, except the richer and great People, who buy the Silks and Callicoes at Sea-port Towns, and at a great Price, as a Cow and a Calf, for no more than will make one Lamber: Other Cloaths the Men wear not, but they adorn them&s;elves with <HI>Mananelers,</HI> which are Rings for their Wri&s;ts; and the&s;e both Men and Women of Di&s;tinc|tion wear. They are &s;ometimes of Gold (but where they get it is more than I know, and perhaps, worth enquiring after;) often of Silver, but more often of Copper; which I found at length is produc'd, and made in the Country as well as Iron. They dre&s;s their Heads hand&s;omely, curling up their Hair to make it lye clo&s;e; for they have Hair on their Heads, and not Wool, as the <HI>Guinea</HI> Ne|groes; neither are their No&s;es flat, tho' they are &s;mall, nor their Lips &s;o big; but their Hair is always black, and for the mo&s;t part curls naturally. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Family are di|&s;tingui&s;hable for their long Hair, and their Copper-colour'd Skins.

"Pray, wi&s;e old Man go on, &s;ays <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> (interrupting <HI>Olaavor)</HI> I &s;ent for you on Purpo&s;e to take your Advice.&mdash;Prepare the Charms.&endq;</Q> Away goes the fumbling old Fellow to work, &s;cra|ping a Root, and mixing of Things, which I knew, had neither Good nor Harm in them; (for I was afraid of nothing but his No&s;e drop|ping into it;) muttering all the While betwixt his few broken Teeth, Words that neither him&s;elf, nor any One el&s;e knew any Meaning to. When the Do&s;e was prepar'd, he call'd it the <HI>Fermonner,</HI> and put it into Carravances boil'd on Purpo&s;e, and it was given me in a Callaba&s;h: But before I eat it, he hung &s;eve|ral Roots about me; one over my Eyes, one at my Back, one on my Brea&s;t, and one on each Leg, giving every one a Name; then &s;craping a little from each of them, and put|ting it into the Me&s;s of Carravances, I was order'd to eat it, which I did without any Concern; in the mean While he pronounc'd his Prayers and Cur&s;es over me. <Q>&startq;&endq;Whenever he thinks of running away, remember, O You <HI>Deaan Fermonner,</HI> how he has eaten what
<PB N="253" REF="273">
belongs to you; and al&s;o,</Q> O Ye, &amp;c. <HI>[Here he nam'd all the Spirits belonging to other charm'd Roots.]</HI> <Q>&startq;how he has eaten what belongs to you; and if he offers to go away, ari&s;e in his Stomach, O <HI>Deaan Fermonner,</HI> and make him &s;o &s;ick, that he &s;hall not be able to &s;tir: And Ye, which have guarded his &s;everal Parts, break his Back; let his Brea&s;t be tormented with Pain, and his Legs chain'd, as with <HI>Parra-pingo's;</HI> and if he &s;ets for|ward join all your Powers, and break his Legs the fir&s;t Time he jumps, or &s;teps over any Thing in his Way.&endq;</Q> Thus he went on for a long Time, but in a more abrupt Manner without any Method, with his Hands to&s;&s;ing, and his Voice changing, high and low, with an hundred impertinent Repetitions, and cant Words of his own Invention; raving like a fanatical Enthu&s;ia&s;t. When he had tyr'd him|&s;elf with Preaching, he takes off the Charms, making me lick every one of them. <Q>&startq;&endq;Now let him go, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> where he plea&s;es; the <HI>Dae|mons</HI> which attend the&s;e Charms will &s;oon acquaint me, and I &s;hall inform his Ma&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>I had a Holliday giv'n me this Day, for my Ma&s;ter was in a good Humout, being highly pleas'd with what he had done; and &s;ent ano|ther to do my Bu&s;ine&s;s. When I came Home, I found my Wife &s;itting in a melancholy Po|&s;ture, being under great Concern, for Fear I
<PB N="254" REF="274">
&s;hould be kill'd. She would have prepar'd me &s;omething to eat, but I told her I had din'd, and related the whole Affair to her. She was glad I got off &s;o well, aud wonder'd I was &s;o dull at it, knowing I did not regard any of the&s;e Ceremonies, and made a Je&s;t of them; but I had quite different Thoughts than &s;he was aware on, or than I dur&s;t tru&s;t her with; which broke my Re&s;t &s;o, that I &s;carce ever &s;lept &s;ound there any more. I found I mu&s;t now run away at all Hazards; for if Sickne&s;s, or any common Accident had attended me, &s;uch was <HI>Deaan Me|varrow</HI>'s Super&s;tition, that he would certainly have thought it had been done by the&s;e Dae|mons or Spirits invok'd in this Conjuration; and took it for an infallible Sign of my Intenti|on to go from him, and very probably in his Pa&s;&s;ion would have kill"d me. So that the&s;e Conjurations, which <HI>Mevarrow</HI> depended on to hinder me from going, had the direct contrary Effect, and was the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Motive, that could have happen'd to force me to it, and made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be &s;o; yet I have often thought how unaccounta|bly true his Prediction, or Gue&s;s prov'd, even in the very Circum&s;tances of it.</P>
<P>WHILE my Head was full of Projections, which Way to bring it about, I could not help &s;aying &s;omewhat relating to my De&s;ign to a very civil, hone&s;t, young Man, who kept
<PB N="255" REF="275">
Cattle always near me; and was a Captive from another Country. I ask'd him one Day where he came from? and he &s;aid from the Northward; I told him if I was &s;o near my own Country as he was, I would not &s;tay here in Slavery. Nor would I, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> were it not for the <HI>Daemons,</HI> who, I am afraid, will break my Bones ever &s;ince the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee</HI> curs'd me &s;o, as he did you; at which I laugh'd. <Q>&startq;Why, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if you are not afraid of that, you may get away with as much Ea&s;e as I.&endq;</Q> I &s;tartled at this, and told him, <Q>&startq;I &s;uppo&s;e he did it to try me.&endq;</Q> But he offer'd to en|ter into a &s;olemn Oath before the <HI>Owley,</HI> that he meant no &s;uch Thing, and would a&s;&s;i&s;t me in it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I went no further with the Ar|gument that Day, but the next I try'd him; for after &s;wearing him in a religious Man|ner, and knowing him to be like mo&s;t Peo|ple, more religiou&s;ly di&s;pos'd under Misfor|tunes than in Pro&s;perity; I freely confe&s;s'd my De&s;ire was to go, and ask'd his Advice: He told me, <Q>&startq;I had nothing to do, but fly directly to <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> who would pro|tect me, and treat me civilly; that when <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI>'s Army came next Summer, I might ea&s;ily get to them, who would be glad to oblige the white Men by &s;ending me Home in the fir&s;t Ship which arriv'd at <HI>Fer|raignher:</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="276">
For, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> no Body in the whole I&s;land will make a white Man a SIave, or keep him again&s;t his Will, but the&s;e People. So that if you get from hence, you will &s;oon get to &s;ome Town where Ships come.&endq;</Q> I thank'd him for his Advice, and told him, I would &s;hew him my Bee-hives, and the Roots of which the Charm was made. This I did to make him keep the Secret. And,</P>
<P>NOW I had but one hard Task more to go through, and that was to per&s;uade my Wife to fly with me; or let me carry her Home to her Father. It was no ea&s;y Matter to break my Mind to her, but at length catch|ing her in an Humour talking of her Friends, and wi&s;hing &s;he could &s;ee them; I told her, if &s;he would be re&s;olute, and &s;ecret, and al|ways love me, I would carry her to them, and &s;tay with her; but &s;he was &s;uper&s;titious too, and afraid I &s;hould be hurt by the Charms of the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee:</HI> So that I could not in&s;i&s;t up|on it any &s;urther. But to part with her, and leave her in Slavery, and perhaps, to be ill|us'd on my Account, was a mortifying Stroak to me, for I lov'd her &s;incerely.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, there was a Nece&s;&s;ity, my Re|&s;olution was fix'd, and I had no Time to lo&s;e; it was now rainy Weather, and I &s;tay'd only till it &s;hould be fair again, which was about a Fortnight: Near which Time I took my
<PB N="257" REF="277">
Companion into the Woods, &s;hew'd him my Hives, and al&s;o the Manner of digging the Roots for the Charms; for it was to no Pur|po&s;e to attempt to undeceive him. The Night before I went away I left an Heifer in the Field on Purpo&s;e, telling my Friend, <HI>When I call'd, and de&s;ir'd him to look after my Cattle, while I went after the Heifer; that &s;hould be the Signal of my Departure.</HI> He told me it was two Days Walk to <HI>Yong-gorvo;</HI> but I &s;aid I would run it in one, and did not doubt of getting &s;afe thi|ther, even tho' my Ma&s;ter &s;hould &s;end after me; if I was but two Hours before them. When I came Home with my Cattle, my Ma|&s;ter look'd on them, and mi&s;s'd the Heifer; but after chiding me a little, he bid me get up early in the Morning, and look for it, be|fore it broke into any Per&s;on's Plantation.</P>
<P>THIS was what I plotted, for to have the whole Day before me; but now came the hard|e&s;t Task, which was to take Leave of my Wife. It was &s;ome Satisfaction that I had no Child by her: I was almo&s;t afraid to tell her, but at length, after making her &s;wear &s;olemnly by the <HI>Owley,</HI> that &s;he would keep the Secret I &s;hould intru&s;t her with, I told her I was go|ing, and the only Trouble I had was parting with her. She begg'd, and cry'd, but there was no &s;taying any longer for me here, my Life was every Day in Danger. Had I been
<PB N="258" REF="278">
in any other Part of the Country, where I could have liv'd free, ea&s;y, and &s;afe, I don't know what Effects the Love I had for her might have produc'd. At length &s;he was a little ap|peas'd from her fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion, and I broke from her Arms by Break of Day, with what Pain tho&s;e of my Readers who are tender Lovers, can bet|ter imagine than I de&s;cribe. I drove my Cattle into the Field, where my Companion was rea|dy; I did not go near him for Fear of Spies, but call'd, and bid him take Care of my Cattle; he &s;aid Yes, Yes: And away I walk'd, or ra|ther ran; for by that Time the Sun was two Hours high, I was got thorow the fir&s;t Woods, which is not much le&s;s than ten Miles, if it could be mea&s;ur'd.</P>
<P>I had now a Plain to go over of five or &s;ix Miles, here I look'd back often, for Fear of Per&s;uers, but &s;aw none; for my Wife and Friend, as I heard afterwards, were both faith|ful. I came to a Pond about Noon, where I ju&s;t wa&s;h'd, and refre&s;h'd my&s;elf, and kept going on, till at length I e&s;py'd the white Clift of <HI>Yong-gorvo.</HI> It is very high, and look'd like Land &s;een &s;even or eight Leagues at Sea; but I was not di&s;courag'd; and two Hours be|fore Night I was at the Foot of it. It is a good half Hour's brisk Walk to go up the Hill to <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s Town, where I at length ar|riv'd, and went directly to him. He thought
<PB N="259" REF="279">
when he &s;aw me, that I came with a Me&s;&s;age from <HI>Deaan Mevarrow;</HI> but I threw my&s;elf at his Feet, and begg'd his Protection; telling him all the Hard&s;hips I had endur'd by my Ma&s;ter's Barbarity, and the eminent Danger my Life was in every Day; and now more than ever.</P>
<P>HE no &s;ooner perceiv'd the Rea&s;on of my Coming, than I di&s;cover'd a Plea&s;ure in his Countenance, and he told me, he would pro|tect me, and I &s;hould be no longer a Slave; he would give me a Gun, and I &s;hould do nothing but go along with him. Now Car|rying a Gun here, like Wearing a Sword in <HI>England,</HI> is the Mark of a Gentleman: <HI>Says he,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;You look with this Lance in your Hand, like a <HI>Mall-a-Co&s;s;</HI></Q> (which is a Nick-name they give meane&s;t of the Natives) <Q>&startq;you &s;hall appear like a white Man as you are.&endq;</Q> I lick'd his Feet with great Satisfaction, and return'd him Thanks; nor did I forget to ac|knowledge the Goodne&s;s of God, who had thus far pro&s;per'd my Endeavours for Liber|ty, and to de&s;ire his further A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>WHEN I told them I came in one Day from my own Hou&s;e, there was no Body gave Cre|dit to it; but about a Week after came two Me&s;&s;engers from <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> to <HI>demand his white Slave, and to reproach</HI> Deaan Afferrer, <HI>for not &s;ending me back by &s;ome of his own Peo|ple</HI>
<PB N="260" REF="280">
<HI>as &s;oon as I arriv'd there.</HI> This haughty Me&s;|&s;age made him laugh. <HI>Says he,</HI> "Send him back! and by my own People too! and his <Q>&startq;white Slave! No Body ever &s;aw a white Man a Slave before; nor has he any Right to make a Slave of him. I look upon him as a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Man, fled to me for Relief; and I will not expo&s;e him to Mi&s;ery. I &s;hall not make a Slave of him, he is at his Liberty, and may &s;tay with me, or go any where el&s;e whenever he plea&s;es.&endq;</Q> He &s;aid a great deal more relating to our People and <HI>Deaan Crindo;</HI> which being to the &s;ame Pur|po&s;e as Others have &s;aid before, I &s;hall not re|peat. In &s;hort, he convinc'd the two Men, in|&s;omuch that they excus'd them&s;elves, &s;aying <HI>They only came with a Me&s;&s;age.</HI> And, <HI>&s;ays he, I only tell you what to &s;ay to</HI> Deaan Mevarrow. And then enter'd into a familiar Conver&s;a|tion with them, and ask'd them the Day I came away; when they told him he was &s;ur|pris'd; and &s;o were they to find I had walk'd it all in one Day; for I don't thiuk it le&s;s than &s;ixty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles. I could not forbear reflect|ing on them, for having Faith in the&s;e <HI>&V;mo&s;|&s;ees,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;See, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> how my Legs are broke, and how the Spirits have hinder'd me.</Q> <HI>They &s;aid,</HI> I was a white Man, and they had no Power over me. After <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> had or|der'd them a Hou&s;e and Provi&s;ions, and I had
<PB N="261" REF="281">
enquir'd after my Wife, I took my Leave of them with Plea&s;ure; for I had &s;ome Doubt before what might be the Effect of <HI>Deaan Me|varrow</HI>'s demanding me.</P>
<P>AND now I liv'd, indeed, with more Free|dom than ever I did before; for I walk'd a|bout with my Gun on my Shoulder, eat, when the <HI>Deaan</HI> eat, tho' not in the &s;ame Di&s;h; for no One does that here. I had nothing to do, but to go along with him a hunting; by which Means I made my&s;elf perfect in all the Ways of taking wild Cattle: My main Bu&s;ine&s;s was ob&s;erving the Country, and enquiring the Way which <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> was expected to come.</P>
<P>I cho&s;e to go often on Hunting, on Purpo&s;e to take Notice of the notable Mountains, which might be &s;o many Land-marks to me. Here is be&s;ides <HI>Vohitch Futey,</HI> or white Hill, another very high Mountain more to the North-ward, call'd <HI>Vohitch Manner,</HI> or red Hill. It is like a Sugar-Loaf, and runs towering up a great Height; the Inhabitants think it to be the highe&s;t in the World. After I had liv'd thus &s;ix Months, almo&s;t the only Time that I did not go a hunting with them, <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> met them accidently in the Fore&s;t, as he was coming to give <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> and the other Lords Notice of the <HI>Feraignher</HI> Army being on their March. This was &s;uch plea&s;ing News to me, that I could not tell how to conceal my Joy, and
<PB N="262" REF="282">
therefore, walk'd into the Woods, for Fear they &s;hould di&s;cover my Intention by my Be|haviour. I would have return'd God Thanks in Engli&s;h, for the Hopes I had of getting to a Sea-port Town; but found I had forgot my native Language, and could &s;carce put three Engli&s;h Words together. However, the <HI>Ma|daga&s;car</HI> Tongue &s;erv'd me well enough to ex|pre&s;s my pious Sentiments.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> told me, when I came Home, of his &s;eeing <HI>Ry-Nanno,</HI> and the News he brought of <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI>'s Death, and his Son's <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI>'s &s;ucceeding him; and of his Ne|phew <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s commanding the Army, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his Brother <HI>Rer Befaugher</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI>'s Brother <HI>Rer Mundro&s;&s;er.</HI> As I was talking with the <HI>Deaan,</HI> I could not help &s;ay|ing I was &s;orry for <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI>'s Death, be|cau&s;e he was &s;o good a Friend to white Men. I perceiv'd immediately he &s;u&s;pected my De|&s;ign, but it was in a civil Manner, he told me he hop'd I had no Occa&s;ion to change my Place of Aboad thro' his U&s;age of me. To which I reply'd, and thank'd him for his Favours, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;I had no Thoughts of changing my Habitation; that I was &s;en&s;ible I liv'd as well, or better than I could do any where el&s;e.&endq;</Q> And, indeed, this was true; for he treated me very hand&s;omely. I eat, and drank as he did, and did no Work; but I found
<PB N="263" REF="283">
by this, that he was not willing to part with me; and therefore I was oblig'd to be more clo&s;e and cunning than I &s;hould have been, had I not made this Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>NOW Orders were &s;ent to the three Towns under <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s Command, that no One &s;hould go out a hunting of wild Cattle; but prepare to hunt the wild Boar, by which they meant the King of <HI>Merfaughla;</HI> and all Hands were at Work, cleaning, and fitting up their Arms; for here are Artificers, who can make, or mend a Spring, and do &s;everal other Things to Guns as well as Lances. The Women made Caps to di&s;tingui&s;h us in the Wars; they are made of the &s;ame as our Mats: The Children beat <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn for to carry with us. I made ready <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s, and my own Gun, and ca&s;t Shot, or rather Slugs, by making a Hole in Clay, with a round Stick to ca&s;t the Lead in, and cutting it in pieces about half an Inch long. They al&s;o buy Shot at the Sea-ports, but this was made, as I gue&s;s, of the Lead, which they had from the Wreck of our Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> went back to <HI>Deaan Trongba,</HI> to meet him at <HI>Vohitch Manner</HI> according to Ap|pointment; and in a Fortnight's Time. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> &s;ent Orders for us to march, and meet him at the River, where we water'd our Cattle in <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Country. I might have &s;taid at Home, but was re&s;olv'd at the Ha|zard
<PB N="264" REF="284">
of my Life to go with them, I told <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> I was afraid of my old Ma&s;ter <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> whom to be &s;ure, I &s;hould &s;ee there: But he bid me not be unea&s;y, for he would protect me; and <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> would not make a Di&s;tur|bance in the Army. But it happen'd better than I expected, for <HI>Mevarrow</HI> was left at Home &s;ick of the <HI>Colah;</HI> which is what is call'd in <HI>Guinea,</HI> or the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> the <HI>Yaws.</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;It is a wretched Di&s;temper, not unlike the <HI>Pox,</HI> affecting the Bones and Joints with great Pain and Sorene&s;s, breaking out all over in Blotches and dry Scabs, infe&s;ting the privy Parts, and under the Arm-pits chiefly; yet is it not the <HI>Pox:</HI> For I have known Chil|dren of three or four Years old have it, who&s;e Parents never had it; tho' there are very few who e&s;cape it once in their Life-time, but they have it no more. For it is, in that re&s;pect, like the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and al&s;o catch'd as that is, or the <HI>Itch.</HI> In&s;omuch that a Per&s;on who never had it, if he fol|lows One infected in the long Gra&s;s, or Bu&s;hes, he will &s;urely catch it; al&s;o by ly|ing, or &s;itting on the &s;ame Mat, or even eating, and drinking after the di&s;ea&s;ed Per|&s;on. For this Rea&s;on they &s;end their Chil|dren, when they have it, to nur&s;e to &s;ome who live alone in remote Places; and when a Man or Family is taken with it, they ob|lige
<PB N="265" REF="285">
them to go into the Woods, and re|main till they are cur'd; which is very of|ten a whole Year, and &s;ometimes two Years.</Q></P>
<P>IT was good News to me, to hear that <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> was left at Home infected with this Di&s;temper; and that <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> commanded the People in his Room. I knew experimen|tally this la&s;t was none of my Enemy, tho' the &s;ame Evening he came, he demanded me in his Brother's Name; but when <HI>Deaan Affer|rer</HI> expo&s;tulated the Ca&s;e, and told him what he had &s;aid to the former Me&s;&s;engers, and added, <Q>&startq;&endq;That it was natural for a Man to fly for his Life, who was every Day in Fear of it, and us'd like a Brute, even tho' he had been a lawful Slave; which he in&s;i&s;ted on was not my Ca&s;e.</Q> <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI> &s;oon gave up the Argument, and turn'd to me, asking, <Q>&startq;If he had not &s;everal Times &s;av'd me, and bid me not be afraid, for he would not in|&s;i&s;t on it any more; de&s;iring I would come often, and &s;ee him as a Friend.&endq;</Q> I grate|fully acknowledg'd his Favours, and thank'd him for this la&s;t &s;ignal One; for he confirm'd the Account I had giv'n of my&s;elf before.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> having Notice of the Day the <HI>Feraingher</HI> Army would join them, put him|&s;elf in Order to receive them with a great Deal of Form and Ceremony. He was &s;eated under a great <HI>Tamarind</HI> Tree, his Sons accord|ing
<PB N="266" REF="286">
to their Seniority&punc; on his Right-hand, and all their People; on his Left were <HI>Deaan Mur|nanzack,</HI> and his Brethren with all their People; forming a Line of above a quarter of a Mile in length. After a little While the <HI>Feraingher</HI> Ar|my appear'd, and as they approach'd us, they came Dancing with each a Gun in their Left-hand, and a Lance in the Right; their Shells &s;ounding and Drums beating. At a little Di|&s;tance they fired &s;ome Pieces to &s;alute us, which was returned on our Side, and now the three Generals, <HI>Deaan Trongha, Rer Befaugher,</HI> and <HI>Rer Mundro&s;&s;er,</HI> went up to <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> and the Re&s;t; and after the u&s;ual Salutations, they were all feated under the <HI>Tamarind</HI> Tree, and ten Calaba&s;hes of Toak &s;ent for by <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> to entertain them. I &s;at all this While behind <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> with his Gun in my Hand. After mutual A&s;&s;urances of their League of Friend|&s;hip, they &s;ettled the Divi&s;ion of the Prizes of Cattle, which was, that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> and his Sons &s;hould have one thrid; <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI> and his Brethren another third; and <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> and his Brother and Cou&s;in, the other.</P>
<P>AFTER they had &s;ettl'd their own Affairs, and began to be chearful over their Toak, <Q>&startq;&endq;&s;ays <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> You have got a white Man among&s;t you I &s;ee. Yes, <HI>&s;ays Deaan Crindo,</HI> this is one of tho&s;e who took me and my Nephew Pri&s;oners; and would have
<PB N="267" REF="287">
deliver'd us into <HI>Deaan Tuley-Noro</HI>'s Hands&punc; who was our Enemy. I don't think, <HI>&s;ays Deaan Trongha,</HI> they would have done you any Harm; you mu&s;t certainly have done them &s;ome great Injury fir&s;t. I did them no Wrong, <HI>reply'd the other,</HI> unle&s;s main|taining them well was wronging them: They wanted indeed to go to <HI>Anteno&s;a,</HI> and I would keep them with me to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Wars. And was not this, &s;ays <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> a great Injury, and a ju&s;t Provoca|tion, to keep Free Men again&s;t their Will in a &s;trange Country? But I will relate a very remarkable Affair of my Grand|father's, with the&s;e white Men, before he was well acquainted with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;There came an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship to our Sea Town, (which they call St. <HI>Augu&s;tine Bay)</HI> for to buy Provi&s;ions, and get Water; they did not go up to my Grandfather's Town, but he went down to them, and pre&s;ent|ed the Captain with two Oxen, as a free Gift; and the Captain freely gave him a Gun, and &s;ome Powder and Shot. The white Men built a Hou&s;e on the Shore to put &s;ome &s;ick Men in. It happen'd &s;ome Days after we had been here, that the white Men, and &s;ome of ours, got drunk together, and a Quarrel aro&s;e among them. They beat one another with their Fi&s;ts at

fir&s;t, but at length Weapons were us'd, and a white Man was kill'd by one of ours. So &s;oon as the News was carry'd to the Ship, the Captain came on Shore, and after enquiring into the Matter, he took hold of the King, while his People ran to the Boat, and fetch'd their Arms. My Father, and <HI>Rer Vovvern,</HI> immediately headed our Peo|ple, and would have fought them; but were hindred by my Grandfather; for he was &s;ure of being kill'd, by one Side or the other; &s;o he went quietly on board their Ship. The Fi&s;her-men were not at all a|fraid of the white Men, notwith&s;tanding this Di&s;turbance, for they knew them well, and were acquainted with their Manners; &s;o they went on board, and ask'd <HI>what the Captain requir'd of the King?</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>Satis|faction for the white Man who was kill'd.</HI> They return'd, and ask'd in the Name of the King's two Sons, <HI>What Satisfaction they demanded?</HI> The Captain reply'd, <HI>They mu&s;t &s;end him the Man who kill'd the</HI> Engli&s;h-man, <HI>and ten Oxen for the Damage.</HI> The Fi&s;her-man had no more Wit than to deliver his Me&s;&s;age in publick; which the Murderer hearing, ran directly into the Woods; &s;o that when they &s;ent to take him he was gone. The Fi&s;her-man return'd to the Cap|tain, and told him, they had made dili|gent

Search for the Man, but he was fled; and if he would have a Slave or two, or twenty Oxen, they were ready to give it him. The Captain was very angry at this, and &s;ent Word, that he would have the <HI>&s;ame Man,</HI> for he had Murder'd his Man bar|barou&s;ly; and if they did not find him, he would keep their Father: But he would grant them ten Days Time to &s;earch for him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;DURING the&s;e ten Days, my Grandfather's Legs had Irons upon them, to keep him from getting away; but he eat and drank with the Captain all the Time, and was very civilly treated. When the ten Days were expir'd, and the Captain was &s;atisfied they could not find the Murderer, he took the Irons off the King's Legs; and ask'd him, If he would enter into a religious Oath, never to wrong any <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> nor &s;uffer his People to do it. To which my Grand|father readily agreed. And after he had din'd with the Captain, they came on Shore together. How, &s;ays <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> do you and your Family eat with white Men? Yes, &s;ays <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> we <HI>Andry Voler</HI> (which is the Sur-name of the Family) do eat out of the &s;ame Di&s;h, and drink out of the &s;ame Cup, and e&s;teem them as our own Family. We never pretend to a&s;|&s;ume

a Power over them, they come, and go, and do as they plea&s;e with us; and if a|ny idle Fellows do ill Things, their Cap|tains do not hinder their being puni&s;h'd. We have great Profit by the&s;e white Men coming among&s;t us, which they would not do, if we did not treat them civilly. Be&s;ides, our Grandfather has bound us all with an Oath, and a Cur&s;e. on all our Po&s;terity, who &s;hall u&s;e an <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> ill. For when he, and the Captain came on Shore, the <HI>Owley</HI> was brought out, and they &s;wore &s;olemnly to a perpetual Friend&s;hip, which we do all &s;trictly ob&s;erve; and think God will not pro&s;per us if we break it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;MY Grand-father gave the Captain twenty Oxen, which he receiv'd; but he would re|turn the full Value of them in Guns, and other Things. And if we had this white Man among&s;t us, we &s;hould give him Cloaths, which his Country-men have left who dy'd there. Says <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> he will hardly wear any of his own Country Cloaths a|gain.&endq;</Q> Better you were hang'd, <HI>thought I,</HI> tho' I dur&s;t not &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>THE next Day we march'd to the Borders of <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> and encamp'd: I lay always in <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s Tent. The next Morning we decamp'd again, and march'd a great Way in|to the Country, towards <HI>Manner-ronder</HI> (a &s;mall

River pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Woozington</HI>'s Chief Town) we pa&s;&s;ed thorow &s;everal &s;mall Towns, but found them all de&s;erted by the Inhabitants; and by the dryne&s;s of the Dung of the Cat|tle, we judg'd they had been gone a Fortnight: For <HI>Woozington</HI> was a politick Man, and would leave nothing for us to live on, neither would he wa&s;te his Army in fruitle&s;s Skirmi&s;hes and weak Attempts; but wait till he had obtain'd the Knowledge of our Strength by his Spies, and al&s;o got all the Force he could to oppo&s;e us. A Man came to me privately from <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> with a Me&s;&s;age, that he de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with me. To which I an&s;wer'd, I would, as &s;oon as I could po&s;&s;ibly contrive to come without any Notice taken. Which I accom|pli&s;h'd in two or three Days, telling <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> I was going to &s;ee <HI>Deaan Sambo.</HI> To this he reply'd, I need not ask him Leave; yet he bid me not go any where el&s;e. By which I knew well what he meant; and that he was jealous of me. However, I returned, and by private Ways in the dark, got to <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s Tent; there were a great ma|ny with him. He &s;poke to me in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> ask|ing me, <HI>how I did,</HI> I was forc'd to an&s;wer in the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Language, telling him, <HI>I had forgot to &s;peak my Mother Tongue.</HI> This, and my being naked, mov'd his Compa&s;&s;ion; that he &s;pake as tender Things to me as my own
<PB N="272" REF="292">
Father could; and wi&s;h'd he could find any Means to take me with him, he would &s;end me Home in the fir&s;t Ship. While we were talking, <HI>Rer Befaugher</HI> came in, who taking me by the Hand, &s;aid, <HI>Ah Brother, how do you do?</HI> I could an&s;wer, <HI>Very well;</HI> but could &s;peak no more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> without a Mixture of this Coun|try Language. They told me there had lately been &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War to &s;eek for Py|rates, and they had directed them to St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s and <HI>Mattatanna,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the I&s;land; that there was but one white Man then among&s;t them, and he was a <HI>Dutch-man;</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> had been kill'd not long &s;ince in the Wars. I told him, I re&s;olv'd, at the Hazard of my Life, to e&s;cape, and follow them; but they &s;aid they would buy me if they gave &s;ix Slaves for me. After Thanks for their Civility, and agreeing not to take any publick Notice of one another, I took my Leave of them, and went to <HI>Deaan Sambo</HI>'s Tent; who al&s;o treated me very hand|&s;omely, telling me, he was going to live by him&s;elf, and ask'd me if I would come to him, which I promis'd to do; I took my Leave and return'd to our Tent. The next Morning a Con&s;ultation was held, in which it was re&s;olv'd to divide the Army into three Parts, and march a-brea&s;t one another; but at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a Mile. We &s;aw no Body all this While, till we were near the Chief Town; and
<PB N="273" REF="293">
then we perceiv'd Spies ob&s;erving us; but the Town was de&s;erted. We pa&s;&s;ed the River <HI>Man|ner-ronder,</HI> and encamp'd on the Plain; where we had not been long, before three Men came and call'd to our People, and bid them tell <HI>Deaan Crin|do,</HI> that <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> would come, and pay him a Vi&s;it the next Morning. Now he was a cunning Man, and full of Stratagems; &s;o not|with&s;tanding this bold Challenge, they knew he would endeavour to &s;urpri&s;e, or over-reach them by Policy; &s;o we went hard to Work every Man to fortify the Camp, which was form'd in a Circle. Trees were cut down, and forked Limbs &s;et up, the Spaces fill'd with great pieces of Wood, pil'd one on another length ways, four Foot high, and joining clo&s;e, made a Wall of it: Then we dug the Ground about a Foot deep, and about &s;even Foot wide, throw|ing up the Earth again&s;t the wooden Pile mak|ing the Wall &s;tronger; we left only two nar|row Entrances. The loo&s;e &s;mall Boughs, with the Leaves on, were thrown, as it were, care|le&s;sly without &s;ide to hide the Fortification; &s;o that it &s;eem'd like nothing but a common Way they have of concealing their Numbers: When we made our Camp &s;ecure, &s;ome Cattle were kill'd, and all Hands to Supper, and then we laid down under our Tent Cloths; for we did not &s;et up our Tents, nor pull off our Lambers, but lay clo&s;e under the Fortification, ready for

an Attack; the Slaves who carried the Provi|&s;ion were plac'd in the Center.</P>
<P>WE aro&s;e at Day-break, putting our Guns through Holes in our Wall left on Purpo&s;e, and kneel'd to fight with the more Ea&s;e and better Aim. We had not not been up above ten Minutes, before we &s;aw them coming down furiou&s;ly upon us. While we were attending to receive them, another Party appear'd on the oppo&s;ite Side, thinking to have come on our Backs; but we being in a Ring were all Front. Our Shells were &s;ounded, and our Drums beat; but we &s;oon changed this for another &s;ort of Noi&s;e. When they came within thirty Yards they fir'd briskly, &s;till coming forward; and thinking nothing of our Wall, expected we &s;hould &s;oon give way from behind the Boughs. I ob&s;erv'd their Eyes red with &s;moak|ing <HI>Jermaughler,</HI> which made them more daring than u&s;ual. (I &s;hall de&s;cribe this after the Relation of the Fight) <HI>Ry-Opheck,</HI> with a Body of Men, attack'd one of the Entrances of our Camp; he came jumping along, his Eyes like Fire, a Lance in one Hand, a Gun in the o|ther, and his People running after him &s;o fu|riou&s;ly, that <HI>Trodaughe,</HI> who &s;hould have de|fended the Pa&s;&s;age, gave way with his People. We were employ'd on our Side, and did not know it, till he had got within our Camp; when one of our chief Men turning, and &s;eeing <HI>Ry-Opheck</HI>

&s;tabbing our Men, and they running before fir'd at him, and &s;hot him in the Belly. When he found him&s;elf wounded he went back again, and fell about thirty or forty Yards from the Place; his People ran back when he did, in&s;tead of revenging him. (See how common Men mi|mick a General's Behaviour!) But when they &s;aw him fall, they return'd to bring off his Bo|dy, and this brought on a fierce Conte&s;t in the open Field; for <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> leap'd over the Works, and mo&s;t of us who were his Peo|ple after him, and made them retire. Here a Man, di&s;tingui&s;hable from the re&s;t by his yel|lowi&s;h Colour, and who &s;eem'd of &s;uperior Rank, took Aim at me, and mi&s;&s;ing, I return'd his Compliment, wounded him in the Thigh, and running up to him, found his Hand full of Powder to charge again, and menacing with his Countenance and Words; but I &s;natch'd his Lance from him, and prevented him from doing any further Mi&s;chief to me&punc; or any Body el&s;e. Another &s;uch Pu&s;h on the oppo&s;ite Side entirely defeated the Enemy that they fled, and we per&s;ued them, but not far; becau&s;e we would not divide our&s;elves, lea&s;t <HI>Woozington</HI> &s;hould have turn'd, and took the Advantage of our Di&s;order; which he would certainly have done, had an Opportunity pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>WHEN we return'd to our Camp, the <HI>Deaans</HI> all a&s;&s;embl'd at <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI>'s Tent, who took
<PB N="276" REF="296">
Notice of every Man according to his Merit, thanking them for their Conduct and Bravery: He next enquir'd of every One what Men they had lo&s;t, and found not above &s;ixteen kill'd, and thirteen wounded. Then he &s;ent out to count the dead Bodies of the Enemy, and found one hundred and &s;eventy five; among whom were &s;ixteen great Men, two of <HI>Woozington</HI>'s younger Sons, <HI>Metorolahatch,</HI> and <HI>Rer Fungenzer;</HI> his Nephews, <HI>Ry-Opheck</HI> and <HI>Rer Chula;</HI> the Others Names I never knew. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> order'd the Bodies of the&s;e &s;ixteen to be cut to Pieces, and thrown about the Field, that their Friends might not bury them. We march'd two or three Days after, further into <HI>Merfaughla$</HI> plundering, and &s;poiling their Plantations.</P>
<Q>&startq;The&s;e People being more addicted to &s;moak <HI>Jermaughler</HI> than Others, it will be proper to de&s;cribe it here. It is a Plant about five Foot high, bearing a &s;mall long Leaf, and a Cod, containing about a dozen Seeds like <HI>Hemp&s;eed:</HI> They mix the Leaves and Seeds together, lay them in the Sun three or four Days, till they are very dry; and then they are fit to be &s;moak'd. They make Pipes of a Reed, or rather &s;mall Cane, and &s;ometimes they have a very long Shell which does well enough. It makes them drunk, their Eyes look red and fiery, and their Looks wild and fierce. It is ea&s;ie to know a Man who
<PB N="277" REF="297">
&s;moaks <HI>Jermaughler;</HI> while the Effects la&s;t, they are more vigorous and fierce; being as it were di&s;tracted. Tho&s;e who u&s;e it much, are good for nothing, but when they are drunk with it. I had once the Curio&s;ity to try a little my&s;elf, it made my Head &s;wim, that I was &s;ick, and as it were drunk for three Days; &s;o that I never meddl'd any more with it.&endq;</Q>
<P>WE were two Days before our Spies could di&s;cover any Cattle. At length they came and told us, they had heard the bellowing of &s;ome; and a thou&s;and Men were order'd to fetch them. They were gone a Week, but they return'd with above two thou&s;and Beeves, and two hun|dred and fifty Captives; Women, and Children. This great Prize made them eager to go again; &s;o on a Con&s;ultation, a Camp was form'd, and fortify'd as before; in which, <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> re|main'd with four thou&s;and Men, while two thou&s;and went out to plunder; and when they return'd, other two thou&s;and were to go.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Afferrer, Deaan Sambo, Rer Mimebo|lambo,</HI> and <HI>Rer Befaugher,</HI> went out with two thou&s;and Men. We had three or four for Guides, who knew the Country well, and where they us'd to feed their Cattle: Neverthele&s;s, we were two Days before we came into any of their Tracks, and then they were all drove off; and, as appear'd by their Marks, different
<PB N="278" REF="298">
So our Army divided, <HI>Deaan Sambo,</HI> and <HI>Rer Befaugher,</HI> went to the Northward, and we to the South-We&s;t. We march'd in the Tracks all Day, and the next Night being Moon-&s;hine: In the Morning we found our&s;elves near the Sea, where they had drove the Bea&s;ts to the Water's Edge, that the ebbing, and flowing, and wa&s;h of the Sea, might efface their Foot-&s;teps on the Sands; which in a great Mea&s;ure, it did: But we march'd on all Day, till we found out where they turn'd out towards the Woods. The next Morning our Spies came in, and told us, they heard a Cow bellow. We &s;oon came to the Plain, where we found above an hun|dred, but the&s;e did not &s;atisfy us; and there|fore, well ob&s;erving their Foot-&s;teps, we trac'd them farther, and found eight or nine hundred. Here were two or three hundred Sheep, which we kill'd; the be&s;t of them we dre&s;s'd for Meat, and left the Others to rot. But we wanted Water, having had none for near two Days. At length, one of our Scouts di&s;cover'd a Pond of thick Water, where the Cattle us'd to drink; and this, hot and foul as it was, we eagerly drank; no better being to be got. Till this Time we &s;aw no Enemies, tho' we expected them; for the Cow-herds fled from the Cattle in our Sight, no doubt, to alarm their Ma&s;ters. And as &s;ome of us were taking up this Wa|ter, as clean as we could, in our Calaba&s;hes,
<PB N="279" REF="299">
One of our Company was &s;tooping down, wa&s;h|ing his Lamber, a Volley of Shot was fir'd a|mong us, before we perceiv'd any Body. We look'd up, and &s;aw about eight or ten Men running back into the Wood, which was ex|tended along on the other Side the Water, within three, or four&s;core Yards. We fir'd &s;ome Shot at them, but they vani&s;h'd out of Sight. There was none of us hurt, but the Man who was wa&s;hing his Lamber, and he re|ceiv'd a Shot in his Fundament; which in&s;tant|ly kill'd him.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING I had been &s;uper&s;titi|ou&s;ly addicted to regard certain fix'd Cha|racters, or Hieroglyphicks, when they happen'd to me in Dreams, (which was but &s;eldom) and us'd to find they foretold Things to me: Yet I could not help ob&s;erving, what a re|markable In&s;tance we had here, of the Vani|ty of tru&s;ting to Dreams; and I did not fail to make U&s;e of it to <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> and to turn their &s;uper&s;titious Praying to their <HI>Ow|leys</HI> into Ridicule. For he &s;eeing me come in a Hurry, and having heard Guns go off, ask'd, <HI>What News?</HI> <Q>&startq;I told him, Nothing, but a Man was kill'd by the Order of his Gods. How! &s;ays the <HI>Deaan,</HI> by the Order of his Gods! What do you mean by that? Why, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> a Man pray'd to his <HI>Owley</HI> la&s;t Night, and when he went to lye down, bid

it be &s;ure to come when he was a&s;leep. Ac|cording to his De&s;ire, the <HI>Daemon,</HI> which at|tends his <HI>Owley,</HI> came, and told him in a Dream; or which is all one, he dream'd he told him, That he mu&s;t wa&s;h his Lamber the next Morning. In Obedience to this di|vine Vi&s;ion, he went along with us to the watering Place, having no other Bu&s;ine&s;s there, and &s;tooping to wa&s;h his Lamber, was kill'd by a Shot, which he receiv'd in his Back-&s;ide, from &s;ome of our fugitive Ene|mies; who fir'd, ran away, and hurt no o|ther Man.&endq;</Q> I had no Fear of <HI>Deaan Af|ferrer</HI>'s being angry with me, Per&s;ecution for differing from them in Religion, is not yet thought of there.</P>
<P>I remember one In&s;tance whil&s;t I liv'd with <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> of a more &s;tupid blind Bigot|try than this. A young Man, who had an <HI>Owley,</HI> the <HI>Daemon</HI> of which, was call'd <HI>Ry-leffu.</HI> He pray'd one Night to him, and <HI>Ry-leffu</HI> came in a Dream, telling him, his Brother mu&s;t &s;hoot at him. Away he goes, early in the Morning, above an Hour's Walk to his Bro|ther, telling his Dream, and de&s;iring him to perform the Order of <HI>Ry-leffu.</HI> His Brother per&s;waded him again&s;t it, but the other re|ply'd, It mu&s;t be done; or wor&s;e will follow. Well, then <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I will &s;hoot towards you, and mi&s;s you. No, &s;ays the <HI>Devout-Man,</HI> it
<PB N="281" REF="301">
mu&s;t be done according to Order, without Eva|&s;ion; and the <HI>Daemon</HI> will certainly defend me from Hurt. The Brother at length was over|rul'd, and loads his Piece, but would &s;tand about thirty Yards, and fire at his lower Parts; notwith&s;tanding his Care he broke a Leg, and then reflecting on his own Credulity, to be wrought upon to do &s;o much Damage, ran la|menting to a&s;&s;i&s;t the wounded Bigot. In &s;hort, with the u&s;ual Means, but not without &s;ome of the Fat of a Sacrifice, which was laid on the <HI>Owley</HI> of <HI>Ry-leffu,</HI> he was cur'd; tho' he never perfectly recover'd the U&s;e of his Leg.</P>
<P>WE drove our Cattle to the Sea-&s;ide, the &s;ame Way we came, by the Water's Edge, and went round that Bay, which is call'd <HI>St. John</HI>'s. I took good Notice of it; there is a Ridge of Rocks, which &s;eem'd to me to extend quite thwart it, &s;o as to leave no Entrance; but if there was a Channel wide enough for Ships to come in, it would be an excellent Harbour; for the Water is very &s;mooth within. I heard that hereabouts on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Ship was ca&s;t away two or three Years before ours, and the People all murder'd; but the Rea|&s;on, or any Particulars thereof, I could not learn. They have no Canoes, neither here, nor in <HI>Anterndro$a;</HI> therefore they can have no Com|merce with Ships: For they are People of the mo&s;t treacherous Di&s;po&s;itions to white Men of
<PB N="282" REF="302">
any in the I&s;land. Whether their little Ac|quaintance with <HI>Europeans</HI> makes them afraid of them? I know they have Notions, that white Men are very much addicted to fighting, and are not &s;o tender-hearted as them&s;elves. This may be a great Rea&s;on of their de&s;troying them for very &s;light Provocations; for they always think the white Men have &s;ome barbarous De|&s;igns on them. So that they are ever &s;u&s;pi|cious, and on their Guard, dreading the daring Boldne&s;s and &s;uperior Skill the <HI>Europeans</HI> have of them in War.</P>
<P>As to their Mercy; where they have con|quer'd them, as in <HI>Anteno&s;a</HI> the <HI>French</HI> did, they made Slaves of them, inverted the whole Order of their Government; and being chiefly igno|rant Seamen, who pretended thus to rule, they regarded neither Morality, Civility, nor com|mon Decency, making no Di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons, confounding all Order, and treating every black Man as if he was a Brute, &s;o much beneath them&s;elves, as not to have a Claim in their Opi|nions to the common natural Rights of human Creatures: So that killing them was no more than killing a Brute. I do not make this as a National Reflection on the <HI>French</HI> only, tho' were Credit to be giv'n to half what the Na|tives &s;ay, there were many &s;candalous and hor|$$d Things done: Our own Country-men are not to be exempted from the ju&s;t Cau&s;e of this

Scandal on white Men; for the Behaviour of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pyrates, and others too, who are not willing to be call'd &s;o, has been very barba|rous.

<P>WE return'd to our Camp with the Cattle four Days before <HI>Rer Befaugher,</HI> who al&s;o got a good Prize of Captives, which they di&s;cover'd by &s;eeing a Smoak; they had Cattle too. <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> was impatient to be at Home, for fear <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> &s;hould go into his Country to plunder it; but <HI>Rer Mundro&s;&s;er</HI> and <HI>Deaan Mu&s;|&s;ecoro</HI> would go in their Turn to &s;ee what they could get; and return'd with Slaves and Cattle.

It was fourteen Days before <HI>Rer Mundro&s;&s;er</HI> return'd; he al&s;o brought Slaves and Cattle. The Cattle were divided the next Day, and the Army march'd back into <HI>Anterndroea;</HI> for <HI>Deaan Crin|do</HI> would not agree to let the <HI>Feraingher</HI> People go Home, till they had accompany'd him into his own Country out of Danger: Our Habita|tion on <HI>Yong-gorvo</HI> Hills was in the Way. The Night before we parted, <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> with his Brother and Cou&s;in, came to take their Leave of <HI>Deaan Afferrer;</HI> after &s;ome other Di&s;cour&s;e he ask'd him, <HI>If he would part with his white Man, and he would give three Slaves for him.</HI> This was a hand&s;ome Price, but my Ma&s;ter, for &s;o I mu&s;t call him, &s;aid, <HI>He would not take three Times three for me:</HI> So no more was &s;aid, and <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> went away. I had an Opportu|nity the next Morning, before they march'd, to &s;ee one of the <HI>Feraingher</HI> Men, and bid him
<PB N="285" REF="305">
tell his General, that I would be with them in three or four Days; for I was re&s;olv'd to run away, and follow their Tracks. But I was pre|vented at pre&s;ent, for being &s;u&s;pected, two Men were order'd never to let me go out of Sight, Night or Day, till we got Home; and for two Months after, I was never &s;uffer'd to go any where without &s;ome Body with me.</P>
<P>BEFORE I take my Leave of <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> it will be but ju&s;t to give my Readers an Ac|count of what few Things I noted, and have not hitherto been de&s;crib'd; and which indeed, are but few, con&s;idering the many Things, which a curious Per&s;on would have employ'd him&s;elf in ob&s;erving: But when it is con&s;ider'd how young I was when I came here, how I pa&s;t the Prime of my Years in Slavery among the&s;e illiterate People, and the little or no Hopes I had of ever getting off the I&s;land; I dare &s;ay it will not be expected I &s;hould at this Time have known what was worth a curious Per&s;on's Re|gard. However, I &s;hall not &s;upply the&s;e Defects of mine, as many Travellers have done, with In|ventions of their own; Things that were for the U&s;e of Mankind I could not help knowing: What are in common with other Places, &s;uch as <HI>Bonana's, Plantanes, Monkies, Turtle,</HI> and an hundred other &s;uch like, I have no Occa&s;ion to de&s;cribe here.</P>

NEAR the Sea Side, there is no good Thing to be found, either on the Trees, or within the Earth, for at lea&s;t three or four Miles; nothing but &s;hort prickly Wood, bearing no eatable Fruit. In the Country, there is great Variety of Fruit; among which, is a Currant, growing on a Tree, not a Bu&s;h, as in <HI>Europe;</HI> it is very plea&s;ant. Here is a very large Tree, that bears a <HI>Plumb,</HI> which is black when ripe, and as big as a <HI>Cherry,</HI> with little Stones like Grapes: There are Thorns on the Tree two In|ches long. Here is a Fruit like a <HI>Slow,</HI> growing al&s;o on a prickly Bu&s;h; but it is very &s;weet. Another Fruit grows on very tall Trees, &s;peck|led like a <HI>Sparrow</HI>'s Egg, and in the &s;ame Form, full of Seeds and a &s;weet Juice: It is held a certain Cure for <HI>Fluxes;</HI> the Leaf of it is like a <HI>Pear-Tree</HI> Leaf. Here is a Tree, who&s;e Leaves, and tender Sprigs &s;ting like Nettles: The Root of this is of great U&s;e in Scarcity of Water, which is in a great many Parts of this Country; and this Root being &s;pungy, it retains a great deal of Juice: We beat it in a wooden Mortar, (in which we beat our <HI>Guinea</HI> Corn)# and &s;queeze the Liquor out. The Bark of the Tree is good to make Ropes of. Here is good Wood for Building; as al&s;o <HI>Cedar</HI> and <HI>Ebony,</HI> but none fit to make Ship-Ma&s;ts of. The Plains are well cover'd with &s;everal Sorts of Gra&s;s, and of dif|ferent Colours; which grow to a much greater

<P>WHEN I was in <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Coun|try, I went &s;ometimes a fi&s;hing; but as I &s;aid before, they have no Canoes, &s;o we only go on the Rocks, and fi&s;h with Hooks and Lines; ne|ver with Nets.

Here are a great many <HI>Lob&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Craw-fi&s;h;</HI> they never run away when they &s;ee the Lights. We have al&s;o a &s;harp Pike made on Purpo&s;e to &s;tick Fi&s;h.

<PB N="288" REF="308">
kill'd, by tearing its great Jaws a&s;under with my Hands; it was not venemous, nor did I ever know of a Serpent, which kill'd, or hurt any Man by its Venom, during the whole Time off my being here: They have bit People, and the &s;ame Hurt has accru'd, as is u&s;ual from the Bite of any Bea&s;t; and no wor&s;e.</P>
<P>WHILE I was in <HI>Yong-gorve,</HI> our Bu&s;ine&s;s and Diver&s;ton was chiefly hunting of wild Cattle; and here I ob&s;erv'd the People call the&s;e Cat|tle <HI>Hattoy's</HI> Cattle, or <HI>Anomebay Rer Hattoy:</HI> The Tradition they have of their Original is, that the&s;e Cattle belong'd to a great Man, call'd <HI>Rer Hattoy;</HI> and he being very covetous would kill none, but let them encrea&s;e, and run a|bout where they would. He liv'd in the wild Fore&s;t, but his Family and People after his Death, went to live with a King of an Inland Dominion, call'd <HI>&V;nt$maroche;</HI> and left mo&s;t of their Cattle behind. Others &s;ay, that <HI>Rer Hattoy</HI> was kill'd with mo&s;t of his People, and the other Cattle being better e&s;teem'd his were neglected; and being in the Fore&s;ts, they en|creas'd without Interruption: But this does not acconnt for the Way they came into the I&s;land. This <HI>Hattoy,</HI> they all &s;ay, was a Na|tive; &s;o that I rather think the&s;e were the original Cattle of the Country, and the tame Beeves were imported; becau&s;e on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Natal</HI> and <HI>Dilligoe</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> there are the
<PB N="289" REF="309">
&s;ame Cattle with Humpsion their Backs. The&s;e were preferr'd to the others, and bred up while <HI>Hattoy's</HI> were neglected: And what confirms this Opinion is, here are two Sorts of People, as if they were two di&s;tinct Species of Man|kind; of which I &s;hall have an Occa&s;ion to give a large Account in its proper Place.</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI> had narrowly watch'd me for about two Months; till he thought the Track of the <HI>Feraingher</HI> Army was not to be found by the Gra&s;s being grown. He took me with him to hunt the&s;e <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cattle again; we had very good Sport, had it not ended tragi|cally: For we kill'd five Cows, and were going a|way, but a Bull ran off with a Lance in his Belly, and we not being willing to lo&s;e it ran after him; and &s;tuck two or three more in his Sides When he felt his Wounds &s;mart, he grew en|rag'd, and turn'd to us. One bold Man threw another Lance, and hit him on the Back; he ran directly at the Man who hurt him, we hal|lo'd to frighten him off; but he per&s;u'd his Enemy, and overtaking him, to&s;s'd him &s;ome Yards above his Head: The Ground was &s;tony where he fell, and we dur&s;t not throw Lances for fear of hitting the Man, who was all this While endeavouring to ri&s;e; but the Bull pu&s;h'd him down as often as he attempted it, tram|pling on him with his Feet, and pu&s;hing with his Horns, he &s;oon kill'd him; having broke
<PB N="290" REF="310">
his Ribs. When we &s;aw the Man was dead, we threw more Lances, till the Bull fell down like a Log. I have known them fight &s;o long, that they have been dead before they fell; hav|ing fix'd their Feet wide, and dy'd &s;tanding &s;o firm, that we have been forc'd to pull them down by the Tail. They were oblig'd to dre&s;s the Meat this Evening, becau&s;e of going home the next Day with the Corps of their Neigh|bour. After we had roa&s;ted the Beef, and &s;upp'd, we made up our <HI>Enters</HI> again&s;t the next Morning. I pack'd up as much as I could well carry; for I was re&s;olv'd to go away this Night. I laid down when the re&s;t did, but could not &s;leep for thinking of the hazardous Journey I was going to undertake. Every One el&s;e &s;lept &s;ound, being tyr'd and their Bellies full; &s;o that about Midnight I took up my Burden, and walk'd away, directing my Cour&s;e to the North|ward, not without recommending my&s;elf to God's Providence to be my Conducter.</P>
<P>THE Direction I had from <HI>Ry-Nanno,</HI> and which, I found on Enquiry from others, was to go to the Southward, till I came to <HI>Vohitch futey,</HI> and leave it on my right Hand, di|recting my Cour&s;e between the North and We&s;t, till I came to the great River <HI>Oneghaloyhe,</HI> which goes to <HI>St. Augu&s;tine Bay;</HI> then keep a|long the River, till I &s;hould &s;ee High-land run|ning along the We&s;tern-mo&s;t Parts of the Fo|re&s;t;
<PB N="291" REF="311">
and then pa&s;s over the River, and go a|way to the We&s;tward.</P>
<P>I walk'd very hard all Night, and when Day appear'd I &s;aw the white Mountains very near: By this I found, I had made a great Progre&s;s, and therefore would not hide my&s;elf as I at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd; but proceeded on my Journey, looking well about me, conceiving how hard it would be for them to overtake, and find me, if they attempted it. I went very mer|rily on, &s;inging <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Songs; for I had forgot to &s;ing in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The Noi&s;e of the wild Cattle would &s;ometimes make me &s;tart, thinking they were my Pur&s;uers. I came to a plea&s;ant Brook, where I baited; and at Sun|&s;et look'd out for a Covert in a Thicket to lye in; I found none but what was too far out of my Way: So I contented my&s;elf with lying in the open Plain, pulling up Gra&s;s for a Bed, and a Stone-pillow; making a &s;mall Fire to warm my Beef. I dur&s;t not make a great One, for fear of being e&s;py'd at a Di&s;tance; for in the Afternoon I could di&s;cern &s;ome Fires to the Ea&s;tward of the Mountain. I was di&s;turb'd in my Sleep by Night-walkers, whom I took for furious Pur&s;uers, and accordingly took up my Lances to defend my&s;elf; but when I was perfectly awake, I found they were only &s;ome of the Inhabitants of the Fore&s;t, <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cat|tle, &s;norting at the Smell of my Fire, and
<PB N="292" REF="312">
ran away much more afraid of me than I of them.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd Day in the Morning I &s;tay'd till the Sun appear'd before I went forward, that I might know how to &s;teer my Cour&s;e; for being abrea&s;t of <HI>Vohitch futey,</HI> I walk'd more moderately; and tho' I was out of Danger of being overtaken by <HI>Deaan Afferrer</HI>'s People, yet I did not know what other Men might be in the Fore&s;t hunting of Beeves; &s;o that I was very circum&s;pect. Nothing remarkable hap|pen'd this Day, I look'd out for a Lodging ear|ly this Evening, &s;eeing the Clouds gather'd black, and found a large thick Tree, where I made a Fire, warm'd &s;ome Meat, and hung up the re&s;t to keep it as dry as I could; for I had nothing el&s;e that the Rain could hurt. At length it came as I expected, in a violent Man|ner, with Thunder and Lightning; it &s;oon came thorow my Roof, I crouded my&s;elf to|gether, with my Head on my Knees, my Hands betwixt my Legs, and my little Lamber co|ver'd my Ears. The Rain ran down like a Flood, but it being warm I did not much re|gard it; in three or four Hours it was fair Weather, and I laid down, and &s;lept &s;ound.</P>
<P>THE next Morning I dry'd my Beef at a Fire, which I made on Purpo&s;e; for it was the third Day &s;ince it was kill'd; but I was very careful of it, not knowing how to kill more at
<PB N="293" REF="313">
that Time: So I made it up in clean Gra&s;s, and went forward. The Mountains, over which I was to pa&s;s, &s;eem'd very high, craggy, and thick with Wood, and no Path nor Opening to be found: It look'd &s;omewhat di&s;mal, but I was re&s;olutely bent to run all Hazards. Tho&s;e Mountains &s;eem'd to me to run quite thwart the I&s;land, and appear'd like, what we call at Sea, <HI>Double Land;</HI> one Hill behind another. I &s;aw nothing all this Day but wild Cattle, and now and then a wild dog; it was fair Weather, and I &s;lept &s;ound this Night.</P>
<P>THE fourth Day I walk'd till Noon, when I baited to dine; my Beef was now very in|different: As I was walking forward in the Af|ternoon, I &s;aw about a dozen Men before me; I skulk'd in a Bu&s;h, peeping to &s;ee if they had di&s;cover'd me; but was &s;oon out of my Pain, ob&s;erving them &s;urrounding &s;ome Cattle a good Way to the We&s;tward on a Hill. I was al&s;o on another Hill, &s;o that I perceiv'd them throw their Lances, and di&s;cern'd three Beeves fall; which, I was &s;ure, were more than they could carry away at one. I &s;tay'd where I was, re|&s;olving when they were gone to have &s;ome Beef. They &s;oon fell to Work, cutting up the Bea&s;ts, and making every Man his Burden, hanging the re&s;t up in a Tree, that the wild Dogs &s;hould not get it, and went Home to the Ea&s;tward. When they were gone, and I
<PB N="294" REF="314">
had look'd well about me, I threw away my &s;tinking Meat, went to the Tree, and took as much as I could well carry; with which I march'd toward the Mountains, not daring to re&s;t for fear they &s;hould return, and e&s;py me. In an Hour's Time I got to the Foot of the Hills in the thick Woods, and &s;eeing no Path, nor Track of Men, nor any Hopes of finding any, not knowing which Way to look for one, I re&s;olv'd to go thorow all; but happening on a Run of Water, I took up my Quarters near it, made a Fire, cut &s;ome wooden Spits, and roa&s;ted my Beef; I kept my Fire burning all Night, for fear the Foxes &s;hould come, and attack me.</P>
<P>THE next Morning I made up my <HI>Enter</HI> with Gra&s;s, binding it with Bark of Trees, and pro|ceeded up the Hill: My Burden was now much lighter. I got to the Top in an Hour, tho' I found no Path but what Swine had made; which was not always in my Way. I per|ceiv'd here was <HI>Faungidge</HI> and <HI>Verlaway</HI> enough, which pleas'd me, tho' I did not at pre&s;ent want it. I climb'd a high Tree to look about me, but could di&s;cover no Entrance: Nothing but Hills and Vales one beyond another; a cragged di&s;mal Wilderne&s;s was all which pre|&s;ented it&s;elf to my View. I would have gone down again, had there not been Danger of be|ing &s;een by the Hunters; be&s;ides I could not
<PB N="295" REF="315">
tell whether to look Ea&s;t or We&s;t for the Pa&s;|&s;age; &s;o &s;etting a Lance up an End, I turn'd the Way it fell, tho' I thought it was due North, or rather a little to the Ea&s;tward. However, Super&s;tition prevail'd where Rea&s;on had no|thing to offer; for I was as likely to be right that Way as any other; and if I went to the Northward, &s;o long as I knew it, I mu&s;t go when I could to the We&s;tward, as Sailors are forc'd to do &s;ometimes, run their Latitude fir&s;t, and their Longitude after. I went down this Hill, and up another, which took me a|bout an Hour's Walk; but when I came to de&s;cend this, it was &s;teep right up and down. I unwarily threw down my Lances, Hatchet, and Burden, thinking to go down by a very tall Tree, who&s;e Top-Branches ju&s;t reach'd clo&s;e to the Brow, but could not do it; yet rather than lo&s;e my Lances, I made Ropes of the Bark of a Tree, and fa&s;tning them to the &s;tronge&s;t Branches, &s;lid down, I dare &s;ay, not le&s;s than thirty Foot. I pa&s;s'd over a fine Spring, and Run of Water in the Vale, the Hill on the other Side was a craggy &s;teep Rock; however I found a Way to a&s;cend, and on the Top climb'd a Tree again; but there was the &s;ame di&s;mal Pro&s;pect. Here I dug <HI>Faungidge,</HI> it being Sun-&s;et, and e&s;pying a Hole in a large Rock, I de&s;ign'd to take up my Lodging there; but peeping in, of a &s;udden I heard &s;uch an
<PB N="296" REF="316">
Outcry, which, with the Eccho in the Rock, made &s;o confus'd a Noi&s;e, that I knew not what to make of it. My Fears prevail'd, and I imagin'd Pur&s;uers and Enemies; for it drew nearer: So &s;etting my Back to a Tree, with my two Lances in my Hand, I waited for the Murderers, when immediately came &s;queaking toward me a Herd of wild Swine; who ran away as much frighted as my&s;elf. When I had recover'd my Sen&s;es, I made two Fires for fear of Foxes, and laid down on my hard Bed; for here was no Gra&s;s, and a &s;tony Place.</P>
<P>THE next Morning, which was the &s;ixth Day, I made a very good Breakfa&s;t with <HI>Faun|gidge</HI> and Bee$, and the Hill extending North and South, I went &s;trait on till it gradually declin'd into a Valley, in which was a &s;mall River running We&s;tward: And I am apt to think it was the Head of <HI>Manner-ronder,</HI> near which we fought <HI>Deaan $$$$ington.</HI> By that Time I arriv'd to the Top of the next Hill it was near Evening; for I was not much le&s;s than two Hours a&s;cending it; and yet I went no &s;mall Pace con&s;idering my Burden, tho' it was not very heavy now. As I was looking out for the be&s;t Lodging, that is a Place with the faire&s;t Stones in it, I e&s;py'd a Swarm of Bees; this was a joyful Sight, for it was Food that wou'd not corrupt with keeping: I &s;oon cut down a <HI>$word$</HI> to put the Honey in&punc; and &s;moak'd them out.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="317">
I made &s;uch an hearty, and agreable Supper this Night, with Honey, Faungidge, and Beef, that I &s;lept too &s;ound; even till I was wak'd with a &s;evere Correction, for my thoughtle&s;s Security. A <HI>Fox</HI> had got hold of my Heel, and was for dragging me along; I &s;tartl'd, and catching a Fire-brand, gave him a blow, which &s;tagger'd him; but he recovering, flew at my Face. I was up an end by this Time, and re|cover'd one of my Lances, with which, I pre|vented his ever a&s;&s;aulting me again; but he made &s;uch a Howling, as brought &s;everal more about him. I &s;aw three, with their Eyes &s;park|ling, but they kept at a Di&s;tance; for I &s;oon made a Blaze, with &s;ome light dry Wood I had laid near me, on Purpo&s;e to keep a Flame all Night; but did not wake to renew it, as I &s;hould have done: So that my two Fires, being re|duc'd to Embers, one of them ventur'd between them; and, it is well, he did not &s;eize my Throat fir&s;t; for I have known &s;uch an Accident, when Men have negligently &s;lept where they haunt. After I had made up my Fires, and drove away my Enemies, I examin'd my Heel, and found two Holes on each Side, made by his Teeth; I bound it up with a piece of my Lam|ber, as well as I could; and making a great Fire, threw the <HI>Fox</HI> upon it by Way of Re|venge. I had none of that Plea&s;ure in eating my Breakfa&s;t this Morning, as I had in my la&s;t
<PB N="298" REF="318">
Night's Supper. Be&s;ides, my Beef was a little too tender now; but as I had Honey enough for a Week, and Faungidge ea&s;y to be found, I did not much trouble my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I walk'd on this &s;eventh Day, favouring my lame Foot, re&s;ting once only all Day: This Way happen'd to be plain, and ea&s;y. At Eve|ning, I came to a Place where &s;everal Bodies of Trees, dead and dry, lay: This I thought was a proper Lodging; &s;o making four Fires, very large, I &s;at me down to Supper, and ven|tur'd to &s;leep with my Fires round me; but my Heel now pain'd me extreamly, and was much &s;well'd, &s;o that I could not go forward the next Day; but finding Faungidge within twenty, or thirty Yards of me, I digg'd &s;everal, and contented my&s;elf to remain here till my Foot &s;hould be better. My Beef was &s;oon gone, but Faungidge was both Water and Food. I &s;av'd &s;ome of my Beef-fat, to dre&s;s my Heel with; which, with the Re&s;t I gave it, in &s;ix Days, took away all the Swelling; for &s;o long I remain'd here. During which Time I made &s;uch large Fires by Night, that if they could have been &s;een, were like tho&s;e of a great Ar|my. I had not far to go for Wood, or any thing el&s;e which I wanted; or at lea&s;t, which I could hope for here.</P>
<P>AFTER this &s;ix Days Pee&s;t, it being the four|teenth &s;ince I left <HI>Deaan Afferrer,</HI> I went for|ward,
<PB N="299" REF="319">
and pa&s;s'd over three very high Hills that Day. My Honey was now gone, and I could find no more; &s;o that Faungidge was my Diet.</P>
<P>THE fifteenth Day I walk'd very &s;toutly a|gain, and pa&s;s'd over &s;everal rough, craggy Hills, which were very tire&s;ome. I always took Care to get dry Wood enough, for I never lay down without four Fires.</P>
<P>THE &s;ixteenth Day, I had not travel'd three Hours, when I perceiv'd the Earth to be of ano|ther Colour: It was Chalky before, and now Clay. This excited my Curio&s;ity, to climb the fir&s;t high Tree I could, from which I di&s;cover'd an Opening to the Northward, which gave me no little Plea&s;ure; but it was at a greater Di|&s;tance than I could reach that Night; &s;o I took up my Lodging as before. I was di&s;turb'd this Night by a Herd of wild Swine.</P>
<P>THE &s;eventeenth Day I walk'd very hard, being in ha&s;te to get thorow this Wilderne&s;s: It was &s;till up, and down Hills. About Noon I got into the open Country, and could look a|bout with Plea&s;ure, and walk on level Ground. I was like a Man deliver'd from a Pri&s;on, hav|ing been twelve Days in this mountainous Wil|derne&s;s. I was almo&s;t &s;ix Days actually tra|veling, and I think, I did not walk le&s;s than twenty Miles a Day: It might have been pa&s;s'd in three Days, if I had been &s;o fortunate as to have found the Path.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="320">
I had not been long in the Plain, before I ar|riv'd at a little Wood, where I took up my Lodging; becau&s;e here was Firing enough, and Faungidge, which I was not a little glad to &s;ee; having been in &s;ome Fear of wanting Provi&s;ion in the Plains: But I had yet a far greater Hope of being &s;upplied, for I was wak'd in the Night by the Roaring of a Bull, by which I found my&s;elf &s;ure it was the great Northern Fore&s;t of wild Cattle which <HI>Ry-Nanno</HI> had told me of.</P>
<P>THE next Day, which was the eighteenth, I &s;aw &s;everal Herds of <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cattle; and found here were more than in the Southern Fore&s;t. I look'd about me, to &s;ee if I could di&s;cover Hunters, or if I could ob&s;erve the Crows to hover about any particular Place; for I might then expect a Bea&s;t, who had been wounded, was fallen there. In the Afternoon I came to a River, which was deep and large: As I was &s;eeking for a Place to wade, or &s;wim over, I &s;aw a large <HI>Alligator:</HI> I &s;till walk'd on the Banks, and &s;aw three more. This was a mortifying Sight, and almo&s;t di&s;pirited me. I walk'd till I came to a &s;hallower Place, and went into the River about ten Yards, thinking to have &s;wam over the re&s;t in four or five Mi|nutes; but before I &s;wam, I e&s;py'd an <HI>Alli|gator</HI> making toward me. I ran back, and he
<PB N="301" REF="321">
pur&s;u'd, till I got into very &s;hallow Water, and then he return'd into the deep; for they never attack a Man on Shore. It vex'd me to be &s;topt by a River, not above an hundred Yards over. At length, I remembred when I was at <HI>Bengall,</HI> where are the large&s;t <HI>Alligators</HI> in the World, and who have been &s;o bold, as to take a Man&punc;out of a &s;hallow Boat; that if we came off from the Shore in the Night, we made a &s;mall Fire at the Head, and another at the Stern of the Boat, which the <HI>Alligator</HI> would not come near. Di&s;tre&s;s puts a Man on Inven|tion, &s;omething like this mu&s;t be done; for here was no dwelling, nor going back: So choo&s;|ing a Stick fit for a Fire-brand, I cut it into long Splinters, and waited till it was almo&s;t dark; then binding my two Fire-&s;ticks to the top of one of my Lances, with the two Lances and Hatchet in one Hand, my Fire-brand burn|ing in the other, and my Lamber twi&s;ted, and ty'd fa&s;t about my Lances, I went into the Water (recommending my&s;elf to Providence) turn'd on my Back, and &s;wam over.</P>
<P>THE Place where I cho&s;e to &s;wim over had a Gap thorow the Thickets on each Side over again&s;t one another; which made it look like an accu&s;tom'd Pa&s;&s;age, either for Men, or Cat|tle. I was no &s;ooner landed, than I heard &s;ome wild Cattle feeding; &s;o &s;peedily extingui&s;hing my Fire, and &s;ilently wa&s;hing my&s;elf, that they
<PB N="302" REF="322">
&s;hould not &s;mell me, I &s;tood clo&s;e under Cover of a thick Bu&s;h in the Pa&s;&s;age, where I expect|ed they would come to drink. The Wind was fortunately with them, by which Means, they could not &s;cent me; tho' they &s;norted often to &s;mell for Enemies. I &s;tood ready with my Lance, and did not wait long before a va&s;t Herd came, running thorow the Pa&s;&s;age to the River; and as they went, I pu&s;h'd my Lance, as force|ably as I was able, into above forty of them; endeavouring to hit them in the Belly. They ran roaring, fighting, and pu&s;hing one another, as it were to revenge the Blows they felt; not expecting any other Enemies, but what were a|mong&s;t them&s;elves. I thought I had wounded enow, and hop'd &s;ome would prove mortal; but would not run any Hazard by Night, con|tenting my&s;elf to &s;tay without Roa&s;t-meat this Evening; &s;ecuring my&s;elf from their Attacks in a thick Wood. The next Morning, when I went to &s;ee what Execution I had done, I found one Bull, and three Cows on the Sand: I &s;oon cut up the younge&s;t, and fatte&s;t, carry|ing it to my Quarters; near which I made an Oven to bake it. This is common, tho' I have not before de&s;crib'd it; but it is thus made: <Q>&startq;A Hole is dug, about five Foot long, two over, and about three deep: This is fill'd with Wood, and kindled; on the top of the Fire, I put about a dozen great Stones,
<PB N="303" REF="323">
which might weigh each a Pound. While the Fire was burning, I cut the Bark off the Tree <HI>Succore,</HI> took the outer Part away, and the inner being pliable, and lying flat, I made the Cover of the Oven. When the Fire is burnt to Embers, I laid three, or four green Sticks a-cro&s;s for my Beef to re&s;t on; the Stones being red-hot, were plac'd about the Bottom and Sides; over the Top more Sticks, and then the Bark covering all clo&s;e with the Earth. This is our manner of bak|ing Meat in the Fore&s;ts.&endq;</Q> I broil'd &s;ome for my Breakfa&s;t, and then went out, to &s;ee if I had done any more Execution, and found &s;ix more Beeves dead, up and down the Plain; but I had enough here. When I came back my Beef was bak'd, and as well done, as it would have been at any Baker's in <HI>London.</HI> When it was cold, I made it up in an <HI>Enter,</HI> but went no farther this Day.</P>
<P>THE next Morning, which was the twentieth &s;ince my &s;etting out, I went forward well pleas'd with my Load: I di&s;cover'd Smoak to the Ea&s;t|ward, but &s;aw no People; wild Cattle here were many Herds: There being &s;everal little Woods in this Plain, I never wanted a Covert for a Lodging, nor Gra&s;s to make a tolerable &s;oft Bed on. The Country was plea&s;ant, and Travelling ea&s;ie; in&s;omuch that I re&s;olv'd, if it &s;hould be my Misfortune, to meet with as
<PB N="304" REF="324">
bad a Ma&s;ter as <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> and no hopes of getting to <HI>England,</HI> that I would run away, and live by my&s;elf in this Fore&s;t.</P>
<P>THE twenty-fir&s;t Day in the Morning I &s;aw &s;everal wild Dogs fighting, and pulling down a Bull, whom I &s;uppo&s;e, had been wounded before; for I never knew the Dogs attack-them el&s;e. I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s to interrupt them, and if I had, it would have been very dangerous; for tho' they do not &s;eek out, and a&s;&s;ault a Man, yet on Provocation they have been known to de|&s;troy Men. This Night was the fir&s;t time I ever felt <HI>Mu&s;quettoes</HI> in the I&s;land; for lying in the Evening in a Covert, near a Run of Water, they &s;o &s;tung me, that I was forc'd to &s;hift my Lodgings; and being Moon-light, I got up, and walk'd three, or four Miles far|ther to the top of a Hill; where I re&s;ted qui|etly. I had no Occa&s;ion to light above one Fire, for here was very little Danger of wild Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE twenty-&s;econd Day I di&s;cover'd a Fog in one long Canal from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; which continuing all Day, and at a va&s;t Di&s;tance, I conceiv&punc;d it to hang over the great River <HI>Oneghaloyhe,</HI> which runs into <HI>Augu&s;tine-Bay.</HI> This put new Vigour into me, to think I was ap|proaching to a Sea-port: I &s;aw two Men this Day carrying Beef, and would have &s;poke with them; but they dropt their <HI>Enters,</HI> and
<PB N="305" REF="325">
ran from me, tho' I call'd, and laid down mine, and went towards them. When they thought I was gone, I &s;aw them return, and take up their Beef again.</P>
<P>THE twenty-third Day in the Morning, I &s;aw the Fog again, which look'd much nearer. I walk'd very hard, being de&s;irous to come to the River, tho' it was Afternoon before I arriv'd within a Mile of it; and then the Bu&s;hes, and thorny &s;mall Wood, were &s;o thick, that it was with great Difficulty, and many Rents in my Skin, that I got to the River|&s;ide. When I &s;aw the va&s;t Breadth of the Ri|ver I was &s;urpris'd; for I dare &s;ay, it was not le&s;s than twice as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Lon|don.</HI> I had been inform'd, that near the Head of it a Man might wade over; but they al|ways had Canoes to tran&s;port them&s;elves over other Parts; whether they &s;ent them up the River before, or where they got them I know not; I had no &s;uch Help. I made my Fire, went to Supper, and laid down to &s;leep, or rather to con&s;ider of &s;ome Invention to get o|ver. In the Morning I re&s;olv'd to look for &s;ome old Trees fallen, or Branches, and in a few Hours happen'd on &s;ome fit for my Pur|po&s;e; &s;ome Bodies of Trees, and great Arms broke off by Tempe&s;ts: The&s;e I dragg'd down to the River-&s;ide, next I &s;ought for a &s;trong Creeper, which is as large as withy, but twi|ning
<PB N="306" REF="326">
round Trees, is pliable: I cut the &s;uper|fluous Branches off of &s;ix long and thick Arms of the Trees, and placing three above the other three, I bound them together, making what is call'd in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> a <HI>Cattama$an.</HI> I built it afloat in the Water, or I could not have launch'd it, and moor'd it to a Lance, which I &s;tuck in the Shore on Purpo&s;e; I then fix'd my <HI>Enter</HI> to pre&s;erve it as dry as I cou'd, al&s;o my Hatchet and the other Lance; then I made a Paddle to row with, and pulling up my Lance, I kept it in my Hand to defend my&s;elf again&s;t the <HI>Alligators,</HI> if they &s;hould a&s;&s;ault me; for I was inform'd they were very fierce here. It blow'd a fre&s;h Gale at We&s;t again&s;t the Stream, which in the Middle made a Sea, that did not a little terrify me; fearing I &s;hould be over-&s;et, and become a Prey to the <HI>Alligators.</HI> However it pleas'd God to protect me, and I arriv'd &s;afe on the other Side, I thought I had made a very good Days Work; &s;o went but little further that Evening before I took up my Lodging.</P>
<P>THE twenty fourth Day I travell'd a great Way, nothing remarkable happen'd: I &s;aw a few wild Cattle, but not &s;o many as on the other Side the River; and tho&s;e I &s;aw were more &s;hy than in the Fore&s;t, by which I &s;up|pos'd it to be an inhabited Country.</P>
<P>THE twenty fifth Day my Burden grew light, and began to &s;mell; but I did not much trou|ble
<PB N="307" REF="327">
my&s;elf at that, being re&s;olv'd to &s;peak with the fir&s;t People I could &s;ee: For I remember'd that <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> told me his Town was clo&s;e to this River on the North-&s;ide. I pa&s;s'd tho|row a fordable River, which runs into the great One: This is a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Country, here are abundance of <HI>Palmettoe</HI> Trees; which in their Language are call'd <HI>Satter-futey.</HI> They bear a long Leaf like a <HI>Cocoanut</HI> Tree, but ano|ther Sort of Fruit; of the&s;e Leaves the People make <HI>Baskets, Caps,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;aw no wild Cattle all this Day.</P>
<P>THE twenty &s;ixth Day I walk'd very hard, baited in the Heat of the Day, and in the Af|ternoon going forward again I e&s;py'd a Smoak, and being re&s;olv'd to &s;peak with tho&s;e who made it I mended my Pace; le&s;t they &s;hould be only Pa&s;&s;engers, who baited as I did, and would be gone; but I &s;oon heard Childrens Tongues. At the In&s;tant they &s;aw me, they ran into the Wood where I had &s;een the Smoak, and im|mediately came out three Men arm'd with Guns and Lances. I look'd behind me for a Shelter, not knowing what to think of them, and retir'd back a little; which they perceiving left their Guns with the Children, and came toward me&punc; I then went to meet them, and call'd at a Di|&s;tance, to know what King they belong'd to? They an&s;wer'd <HI>Deaan Mernaugha;</HI> and as a fur|ther Token &s;eeing me a white Man, &s;poke two
<PB N="308" REF="328">
or three Words in broken <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They then ap|proach'd near, and we &s;hook Hands, &s;aluting one another with the u&s;ual Compliment <HI>Salamonger:</HI> They de&s;ir'd me to go with them to their Cot|tages, where we &s;at down, and I gave them an Account of my Travels. They &s;aid they had heard of me, and having <HI>Su&s;ers</HI> boiling, they de&s;ir'd me to eat with them: After which I enquir'd of the News of the Country relating to their Trade, War, and Peace; and one of them gave me the following melancholy Ac|count of it.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;THAT their late King, <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> had kill'd him&s;elf with Grief at an Inva&s;ion, which <HI>Rer Trimmenongarevo</HI> made with nine thou&s;and Men, and took his two Daughters captive. <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> follow'd him with &s;e|ven thou&s;and, but the other by a Stratagem the mean Time got privately into <HI>Ferangher,</HI> and plunder'd it; <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> at the &s;ame Time attack'd the Southern Parts, hav|ing made Canoes, and pa&s;s'd the great River, the other Pa&s;&s;ages being &s;topp'd: He took al&s;o a great many People, but <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> and his Brother <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> who remain'd at Home with two thou&s;and Men, routed him, and prevented his carrying away the Captives; which &s;o enrag'd <HI>Woozington</HI>'s barbarous Di&s;|po&s;ition, that he &s;lew a great many Women and Children. <HI>Rer Trimmenongarevo</HI> took a
<PB N="309" REF="329">
contrary Method, for he &s;ent Me&s;&s;ages in|viting the People to come, and live in his Country, and be his Subjects, and he would give them their Wives and Children again; which Promi&s;e he perform'd, and &s;till conti|nues, &s;o that many hundreds are gone away: And he &s;till embarra&s;&s;es us &s;o much, that we who are not willing to leave our Native Country, are many of us forc'd to fly into the&s;e Fore&s;ts, and lonely Places, to be &s;afe; contenting our&s;elves with what the Country produces naturally, as you &s;ee we do: For we dare not plant, nor keep Cattle, for fear of being &s;urpris'd. We have another petty King in the Mountains, who takes this Op|portunity to make Inroads, and helps to im|poveri&s;h us, &s;o that we are &s;urrounded with Enemies; and tho&s;e who remain in Towns are almo&s;t fami&s;h'd: For we have no Friends but white Men, and there has been no Ship come a long Time; and when they know our Poverty they will come no more. Thus This, which was lately the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Kingdom in the I&s;land, is reduc'd to almo&s;t nothing.</Q></P>
<P>THIS melancholy Story &s;o &s;hock'd me, that I &s;at mute and &s;tupid, till the Man perceiving it rous'd me by asking my Name; and if I would not go to the King fir&s;t before I went to <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> as (they &s;aid) was my Duty: But I
<PB N="310" REF="330">
told them I was a Freeman, and would do as I had already acquainted them; &s;o giving me a Mat I lay down, thinking of the hard Fate which pro&s;ecuted me; but as Providence had conducted me hitherto, I did not doubt, in due Time, my Deliverance would be perfected; and with this Re&s;ignation I went to &s;leep.</P>
<P>THESE Men were very civil to me, de&s;iring I would &s;tay two or three Days; but I only break-fa&s;ted there, giving them &s;ome Beef which they wanted; tho' mine was far from good. When they found I would &s;tay no lon|ger, they made me up a Bundle of roa&s;ted <HI>Su|&s;ers</HI> to carry with me, and accompany'd me till I got into the Path; &s;hewing me how to find the&s;e <HI>Su&s;ers,</HI> which till then I had not &s;een: They grow like <HI>Wild Yams.</HI> Here were al&s;o <HI>Berbows</HI> and <HI>Wild Yams,</HI> which were their principal Food; this was the twenty &s;eventh Day of my Travels. I turn'd out of the Path into a Wood, looking for &s;uch an Inn as had &s;erv'd me many a Night before; which I &s;oon found, made a Fire, &s;upp'd, and &s;lept very con|tentedly.</P>
<P>THE next Morning I met four Men, who told me I could not reach <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s Town; but I might <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI>'s, and he would &s;end a Man with me. My Way lay over a high Hill, from whence I &s;aw the Sea, and the Road, where the Ships us'd to lye in <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>
<PB N="311" REF="331">
<HI>Bay;</HI> on the other hand the great River, and the Country very plea&s;ant along its Banks: When I came to the Bottom, &s;ome Boys, who look'd after Cattle, came running to me, for they are not afraid of white Men; and one of them very civilly would go, and &s;hew me the Way to the Town. When I came there the People &s;tar'd at me, wondring what &s;ort of a white Man I was without Cloaths; &s;ome &s;aid <HI>a Ship was arriv'd;</HI> but mo&s;t &s;aid, <HI>I could not come from a Ship naked, and without a Hat.</HI> When I came near <HI>Rer Ba|faugher</HI>'s Hou&s;e, I &s;aw him look at me, not know|ing me at fir&s;t; but when I came nearer he got up from his Seat, clapp'd his Hand to his Mouth, and cry'd, <HI>Ah!</HI> Ry-Robin, <HI>how came you here?</HI> He embrac'd me as if I had been his Brother. When I was &s;eated &s;everal came about me, &s;ome who knew me in the Army, ask'd me, <HI>Who ac|company'd me?</HI> and wonder'd how I could find the Way alone: But when I told them how I mi&s;s'd the Way, and came thorow the moun|tainous Wilderne&s;s, and of my Inventions to pa&s;s the Rivers, they were &s;urpris'd.</P>
<P><HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> took me into his Hou&s;e, and at Supper we eat out of one Di&s;h; he had roa&s;t Beef, and his Wife brought Milk on Purpo&s;e for me. I ask'd him about the State of the Country, and he gave me much the &s;ame Ac|count I had before; adding, <Q>&startq;&endq;He expected eve|ry Day when <HI>Rer Trimmenongarevo</HI> would
<PB N="312" REF="332">
come, and take the whole Country; for they had no Force able to re&s;i&s;t him; however, they, who were the Pillars of the Land, would &s;tand till they were cut down by Death, and not fly: For indeed, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> we have no where to go but into the Sea; and we don't under&s;tand living there as you white Men do.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN we had &s;upp'd, and talk'd till I was &s;leepy, he &s;ent a Man with me to a Hou&s;e pre|par'd on Purpo&s;e. The next Morning I de&s;ir'd he would plea&s;e to &s;end a Man to &s;hew me the Way to <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s; but he would go him|&s;elf. I told him <HI>It was beneath his Dignity to at|tend a Slave as I was.</HI> He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;He never thought white Men Slaves; and that he had waited on many: And <HI>Rer Vovvern,</HI> and he too had taken Care of &s;ome, cloathing and main|taining them, tho' they did not de&s;erve it; but they did it for the &s;ake of others: For, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> here come &s;ome very bad People, who quarrel with one another, and come a&s;hoar, and never go aboard again; behaving them|&s;elves very ill.&endq;</Q> <HI>I ask'd him,</HI> <Q>What they &startq;tra|ded for here? <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> Nothing but Provi&s;ion; for which they gave them Gold and Silver Money, and &s;ometimes Pieces of Silk, and when they &s;ail away no One knows to what Country they go; nor them&s;elves neither: For they are wicked, carele&s;s Wretches, and all their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to rob other Ships. <HI>I
<PB N="313" REF="333">
told him,</HI> They did not do well to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, or &s;ell them Provi&s;ion; and that the Go|vernment of <HI>England</HI> was at a great Charge to fit out Ships on Purpo&s;e to de&s;troy them; for they &s;poil the Merchants Trade, and were a Scandal to their Country. <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> The Generality of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were good People, and by the Trade they drove with them were a great Benefit to the Country; that he had been on board &s;ome Ships, and found &s;ome Captains were hone&s;t Men, for they us'd to treat him very civilly, and give him <HI>Wine, Punch,</HI> and <HI>Brandy,</HI> and &s;ometimes they had another Liquor, which was very bitter, they lov'd it them&s;elves; it was ty'd down with Iron, but he had forgot the Name. <HI>I told him,</HI> It was Beer. <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> Yes; but he could never drink it.&endq;</Q> Thus we went chatting all the Way to <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s, which was about two Hour's Walk: When we came to the Town the People flock'd about me, &s;ome &s;aying <HI>a Samb-Tuley,</HI> which is, <HI>A Ship was arriv'd;</HI> but others &s;aid <HI>No; for Men come not naked from a Ship.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN I came before <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> I found he did not know me; I offer'd to kneel, and lick his Feet, but he would not &s;uffer me: <HI>Say|ing,</HI> Let him be who he will, he is a white Man; and they &s;hall never lick black Mens Feet. At length, his Brother told him who I was; he no &s;ooner heard it than he ro&s;e, and embrac'd me
<PB N="314" REF="334">
with a great deal of Joy, and Friend&s;hip, and after &s;etting down, and giving them an Account of my Travels, and &s;ome Admirations had been made, <HI>He told me,</HI> I was &s;till very unfor|tunate; for they were in a very poor Condition, and I &s;hould be di&s;appointed if I expected to live happy here. I told him, it could not be wor&s;e than it had been with me hitherto; and I was re&s;olv'd to live with him, and &s;erve him, if he pleas'd to accept of my Service, as long as I liv'd, unle&s;s he would be &s;o good as to &s;end me Home, when a Ship came. <HI>He told me,</HI> I &s;hould fare as him&s;elf; for he look'd on it as his Duty to relieve a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed white Man, for the Benefit he, and his Family had receiv'd by my Country-men. In &s;hort, he receiv'd me with that Affection, and treated me with &s;o much Ten|derne&s;s, that my own Father could not have &s;hew'd more Compa&s;&s;ion: He lamented very much the Calamity of his Country, and <HI>&s;aid,</HI> He was afraid the white Men would know it, and not come to Trade with them, and give him an Opportunity of &s;ending me Home.</P>
<P>AFTER I had eaten, and drank with him, he took his Leave of his Brother, being oblig'd to go with other People to guard the Slaves who were at Work in the Plantations; le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;urpris'd, and taken by &s;mall Parties of their Northern Enemy, who skulk'd in co|vert Places, on Purpo&s;e to &s;ally out, and carry
<PB N="315" REF="335">
off what they could get on a &s;udden, and run away again. A little Way out of Town, we came to a large Thicket of <HI>wild Canes, Reeds,</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;hes;</HI> in which were the Plantations, bounded on the other Side with the great Ri|ver <HI>Oneghaloyhe.</HI> Here were <HI>Plantins, Bonanoes, Sugar-Canes,</HI> and <HI>Rice;</HI> all the&s;e were not com|mon to the Southern Country from whence I came; but here were al&s;o a great many Things which I had &s;een before; as <HI>Anbotty, An|choroko,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e were all newly planted, and &s;ow'd; for the Enemy had de&s;troy'd all the Plantations in the In-road they made, whil&s;t <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> &amp;c. were in the late War in <HI>Merfaughla.</HI> I was in &s;ome Fear he was going to &s;et me to Work; but this was &s;oon di&s;&s;i|pated, when he gave me his Gun, and <HI>told me,</HI> &s;ince I was willing to call my&s;elf his Servant, all he would require of me, &s;hould be to carry his Gun; and take Care, when I had it, never to be the length of it from him, that he might reach it in Ca&s;e of a Surpri&s;e.</P>
<P>AS we went homewards, &s;ome of our Peo|ple climb'd up <HI>Tamarind</HI> Trees, and gather'd a great deal of the Fruit. I ask'd them what they did with it.

but when I came Home, there were Flatters full of it mix'd for our Supper: The Strings of the <HI>Tamarinds</HI> appearing in it, and being white, when thus mix'd, I could not for|bear thinking it like Mortar with Hair in it; but ta&s;ting, I found it as they &s;aid, very &s;weet: Neverthele&s;s, I could not be reconcil'd to it at fir&s;t, being prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd, as Men too often are, even again&s;t the Te&s;timony of their Sen&s;es. <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> &s;eeing the Grimace I made, told me, <HI>That this was always held a plea&s;ant Di&s;h, when they had the greate&s;t plenty of other Things.</HI> Now, indeed, &s;ays he, <HI>We have &s;ometimes nothing el&s;e to eat.</HI> I have &s;een many unexpected &s;trange, and odd Things eaten; but nothing ever &s;ur|pris'd me &s;o much, as &s;our <HI>Tamarinds,</HI> mix'd with wood A&s;hes, becoming &s;weet, and eatable. Let the Chymi&s;ts rea&s;on, and philo&s;ophize upon it at their Lei&s;ure, I do a&s;&s;ure them of the Truth of the Fact, and can bring &s;ome Gentlemen, now living in <HI>London</HI> to te&s;tify the &s;ame, that have &s;een me mix it. It did not well agree with me the fir&s;t time I eat it, making a rumbling Di&s;order in my Stomach: I &s;uppo&s;e it fermented there; but after I was was us'd to it, I never found any Inconveni|ence attend it.</P>
<P><HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> had two Wives, each hav|ing a Hou&s;e to her&s;elf: He divided him&s;elf pretty equally between them, living near as
<PB N="317" REF="337">
much at the one Hou&s;e, as at the other, for Peace-&s;ake: Now it is u&s;ual for them to appoint every Slave his proper Mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e Com|mands he is to attend; and &s;he is to &s;ee what they want, and give it them. He did not ap|point me any &s;uch Service, but &s;aid, I was a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Man, ca&s;t by Providence among&s;t them, and it was their Duty to provide for &s;uch; but he had a more particular Regard to me, for the &s;ake of my Fathers, and Brothers (meaning <HI>Engli&s;hmen)</HI> and he had therefore or|der'd that I &s;hould be taken Care of at both their Hou&s;es, and therefore bid me go to them at my Plea&s;ure, where I found the be&s;t Provi&s;ion; and as long as there was Meat, I had my Part with them. I ob&s;erv'd, notwith&s;tanding, he be|hav'd him&s;elf with Decency to them both, yet his fir&s;t Wife had &s;ome Preference to the other; and we therefore di&s;tingui&s;h'd her by the Title of his <HI>Head-Wife.</HI> He was at her Hou&s;e, when I fir&s;t came, and when he gave the&s;e Directions; &s;o &s;he immediately furni&s;h'd me with a Pot or two, Callaba&s;h, &amp;c. for my U&s;e; but having not all I wanted, he &s;ent a Man with me to the Other, and &s;he as readily &s;upplied me with what I had Occa&s;ion for, chiding me in a friendly Manner, for not coming &s;ooner to &s;ee her; &s;o I &s;at down, and had half an Hour's Conver&s;a|tion with her, they both behaving them&s;elves with great Civility to me.</P>

THE next Morning came two Me&s;&s;engers from <HI>Deaan Mernaugha:</HI> The King de&s;iring <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> to go, and con&s;ult with him on Affairs of Importance. They were going away, but notwith&s;tanding, it was &s;uch a &s;carce Time, he would not let them depart till he had kill'd a Heifer to entertain them with. And here as in <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> I found the &s;ame generous Man|ner of Treating one another; for mo&s;t of the People in Town came near the Hou&s;e, and none went away without a Piece of Beef. They have but a &s;lovenly Way of dre&s;&s;ing their Meat here; for the Liver, as &s;oon as it was taken out, was thrown into the mid&s;t of the Fire, and broil'd in the A&s;hes, and Smoak; and the Entrails with very little cleaning were broil'd: I had a Piece of Beef given me to dre&s;s at Home, and we all liv'd well while this la&s;ted. When I went the next Morning, the <HI>Deaan</HI> was dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to go; for notwith&s;tanding, he had no Cloaths to put on, yet his Hair took up &s;ome Time to curl up, and plat in Knots, and he was &s;hav'd neatly; then the <HI>Owley</HI> was brought out, and dre&s;s'd to be carried before him; for he went in State. There was not a &s;incere, and hearty Friend&s;hip between <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> and him, which made him go in more Form than he otherwi&s;e would have done: I carried his Gun after him. We march'd up an ea&s;ie A&s;cent of near two Miles, when I perceiv'd
<PB N="319" REF="339">
we were near the Sea; the De&s;cent on the other Side extended to the Shore of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine Bay,</HI> where Ships u&s;ually ride. Here <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> &s;hew'd me where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> built their Hou&s;es, while they remain'd here to trade. It was an agreeable Pro&s;pect to me, tho' there were no Ships. I &s;aw &s;ome Canoes a great Way out at Sea, the Men were &s;triking, and darting of Fi&s;h, and &s;ome were in the Water, not Knee deep, at the &s;ame Sport; for the Sand is almo&s;t flat, &s;o that one may walk near a Mile into the Sea at Low-water. The Sea-coa&s;t lay near North, and South; from whence I came it lay Ea&s;t, and We&s;t. After we had pa&s;s'd thorow a Wood on a Point of Land, we came among the Towns belonging to <HI>Deaan Mernaugha.</HI> The People all wonder'd to &s;ee a white Man naked, and took me at fir&s;t for the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> who had liv'd among them, and who would have &s;ometimes very odd Frolicks; but my Fame &s;oon went before me, and I was known when I came to <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI>'s: For after the u&s;ual Compliments were over, I not being in Sight, having deliver'd my Ma&s;ter his Gun, he ask'd, Where was the white <HI>Man,</HI> who came from <HI>Anterndroea.</HI> On which I came forward, and was &s;eated among them. The King ask|ing me of my Travels, and Fortune, and I gratify'd him with my whole Story at large. A Bullock was given <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> for his, and his Retinue's Entertainment.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="340">
AT Night a Con&s;ultation was held on the Affair they met about; there were none admit|ted to this but a few principal Men, among whom I had the Honour to be; and to my great Mortification, heard <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI> propo&s;e to &s;end nine, or ten hundred People under <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s Command, as before into <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> to joyn with <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> again&s;t <HI>Deaan Woozington.</HI> This was approv'd of, and agreed to; the Manner, and Time was ap|pointed, which was to be &s;ome Months after. When we came away, <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> told me, They had all of them Confidence in me, knowing it to be my Intere&s;t to keep their Secrets. But, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> <Q>&startq;A more than ordinary Care is nece&s;&s;ary now; for the common People de&s;ert us, and go to live under other Lords if they don't like our Proceedings; tho' all we aim at is their own Good and Safety: But they have not the Sen&s;e to know it, and will always be cen|&s;uring our Conduct, and finding Fault, tho' we lo&s;e our Wives, Families, and Cattle, and run the Hazard of our Lives to protect them. It is natural, for mean People to abu&s;e their Go|vernours; but Governours mu&s;t do Good to their Country, and defend Mankind from In|juries, and never regard the&s;e Reflections; but then we mu&s;t keep &s;ecret tho&s;e Things, which we know before-hand, they have not Sen&s;e to under&s;tand, nor judge of.&endq;</Q> I a&s;&s;ur'd

him of my Fidelity, but told him, I was un|der great Concern at what I heard, being afraid he would de&s;ire me to go with him; where I &s;hould &s;ee my former Ma&s;ter, <HI>Mevarrow,</HI> who&s;e barbarous Di&s;po&s;ition I had too much Experi|ence of, not to dread the Con&s;equence of being within his Power. He reply'd, I never could be in his Power any more, for they know, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> my Re&s;olution, and that it would be dangerous for any Man to provoke me to &s;uch a Degree; &s;ince it might be the Ruin of the whole Army; for he would protect me at the Hazard of his own Life, and revenge with the utmo&s;t Rigour any Injury that &s;hould be done to me. I was not entirely &s;atisfy'd, tho' know|ing him to be a Man of &s;trict Honour, I had &s;ome Security in depending on it. When I return'd to my Companions, they endeavour'd to &s;ift out of me the Matter of their Coun|cil; but I told them with a very negligent Air, <Q>&startq;&endq;That I &s;tood at a Di&s;tance, and did not mind one Word they &s;aid.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> took his Leave the next Morn|ing, telling the King his Nephew, his <HI>Owley</HI> had in the Night warn'd him of &s;ome Dan|ger attending his Town from the Enemy, if he &s;tay'd long. I de&s;ir'd, &s;ince I was on this Side the Country, I might go and &s;ee <HI>Egla&s;&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Dutchman.</HI> The <HI>Deaan</HI> told me, He would make it in his Way Home.

<HI>Egla&s;&s;e,</HI> when they came running to him, and cry'd <HI>Arve, verzahar;</HI> that is, <HI>A white Man is coming;</HI> for he knew of none in the Country. There was living near him one <HI>Efflep,</HI> a Negroe of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> who was left a&s;hoar by Pirates many Years before, and &s;poke nothing but <HI>Eng|li&s;h:</HI> He was very deaf, and therefore never learn'd the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Language; but he had two Sons born on this I&s;land of a native Mother, who &s;poke both Languages. When I approach'd <HI>Egla&s;&s;e,</HI> he pull'd off his Hat to me; but poor <HI>Robin</HI> had none to return the Compliment with: He &s;poke <HI>Dutch</HI> to me at fir&s;t, but perceiving I did not under&s;tand it, he &s;poke a little broken <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and I had as little to an&s;wer him in. I ask'd for an Interpreter to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for me; which &s;et <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> and all of them a|laughing at fir&s;t; but they afterwards pitied my hard Fortune, to have liv'd all the Prime of my Days in a foreign Country. But <HI>James,</HI> who was <HI>Efflep</HI>'s elde&s;t Son, carry'd on a Conver|&s;ation among&s;t us to all our Satisfaction; <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> ask'd me to live con&s;tantly with him, but I told him I would not leave <HI>Deaan Trongha;</HI> in which I was in good Earne&s;t: For he was a Man gene|rous and humane, of great Authority, and there|fore an able Protector; but I de&s;ir'd they would get Leave of him to let me &s;tay two or three Days with them; which they did, and he as readily agreed to give me a Week. I had heard
<PB N="323" REF="343">
but an indifferent Character of <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI>'s Tem|per, he was ra&s;h and pa&s;&s;ionate, and would, on every trivial Occa&s;ion, threaten the great Men; and even the King him&s;elf, with what he would do when a Ship came. This imprudent Beha|haviour render'd him di&s;ta&s;teful to them, and I was therefore afraid to enter into too &s;trict an Amity with him, and it will appear By-and-by, that I was right; for his continu'd indecent Be|haviour co&s;t him his Life at la&s;t.</P>
<P>WE having now taken our Leaves of <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> and his Retinue, the Pot was &s;et on by a Slave nam'd <HI>Toby,</HI> with a Piece of &s;alt Beef and Potatoes after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manner. In the mean Time <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> de&s;ir'd <HI>James</HI> to relate to me the Hi&s;tory of his Arrival and Adventures here; and this conducing to my Purpo&s;e, which is to give all the Account I can of the different Cu&s;|toms and Manners of this I&s;land, as may be u&s;eful to Traders and Navigators, and plea|&s;ing to the Curious, I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe as he then told it.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;AT a Place call'd <HI>Ma&s;&s;eelege</HI> on this I&s;land to the Northward, there comes once a Year a <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Ship bringing &s;ilk Lambers, and many other Things, to trade with for Slaves. At this Place one <HI>Burge&s;s,</HI> call'd Capt. <HI>Burge&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Robert Arnold</HI> had a Sloop; <HI>Burge&s;s</HI> commanded, for <HI>Arnold</HI> knew nothing of Navigation, tho' he was as rich as the
<PB N="324" REF="344">
other, and as much concern'd in the Ve&s;&s;el; with this Sloop they us'd to come to <HI>Augu&s;|tine Bay,</HI> and other Places on the I&s;land to buy Slaves, and carry them to <HI>Ma&s;&s;eelege</HI> a|gain&s;t the <HI>Moors</HI> Ship arriv'd: <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> &s;ail'd with them in this Sloop. In one of their Voy|ages to this Place <HI>Burge&s;s</HI> and <HI>Arnold</HI> quar|rell'd; and it came to that Height, that <HI>Ar|nold</HI> would &s;tay no longer with him; but en|gaging <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> to come on Shoar for his Com|panion, he brought all his Effects with him, which were very con&s;iderable; &s;everal Bags of Dollars, a great many Guns, Powder, Shot, Che&s;ts of Cloaths, Beads, &amp;c. In &s;hort, every Thing which is proper to trade with here. He told <HI>Egla&s;&s;e,</HI> that if he &s;urviv'd him he &s;hould have all his Effects; but their De&s;ign was only to &s;tay till a Ship arriv'd, in which they could procure a Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Europe:</HI> Whether they dur&s;t go to <HI>England</HI> I cannot truly &s;ay, for I had &s;ome Rea&s;on to think a great Part of the&s;e Riches were obtain'd by Piracy. There were two black Slaves; this <HI>Toby,</HI> and another, who will be here pre&s;ently call'd <HI>Robin,</HI> both whom &s;peak good <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> the&s;e &s;wam a&s;hoar the &s;ame Night Capt. <HI>Burge&s;s</HI> &s;ail'd away, and &s;urren|der'd them&s;elves to <HI>Arnold.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IT happen'd a little before <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI>'s Death, (and which was indeed the Occa&s;ion
<PB N="325" REF="345">
of his Death) that this Country was inva|ded by two Enemies at once: While the greater Part of the Lords and People were gone to oppo&s;e the Northern Enemy, the Southern one, <HI>Woozington,</HI> came unexpectedly on us; having pa&s;s'd the great River un&s;u|&s;pected by us, and a bold General of his nam'd <HI>Ry-Opheck,</HI> attack'd the Town and King's Hou&s;e in the Night; <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> him|&s;elf was wounded in the Thigh. Another Party came towards us, every Body was for flying to &s;ome Shelter as is u&s;ual, and indeed nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch Ca&s;es: But <HI>Arnold</HI> and <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> having great Riches were re&s;olv'd to defend it; and therefore arm'd them&s;elves with Guns, Pi&s;tols, and Cutlaees; but they no &s;ooner ap|pear'd at their Door than <HI>Arnold</HI> was &s;hot dead. <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> was then glad to fly with his two Slaves, <HI>Robin</HI> and <HI>Toby;</HI> for they never left him: The Enemy plunder'd the Hou&s;e of what they thought fit, which was all his wearing Apparel, or any Thing like it, even his Beds for the Ticking-&s;ake; the Silver being black, they did not know it; therefore con|tented them&s;elves with throwing it about: They kill'd the Cattle they found in the Pens; for they had not Time nor Strength enough to carry them off, and defend them|&s;elves when once the Country made Head a|gain&s;t them. However, they took &s;ome Cap|tives,
<PB N="326" REF="346">
and march'd away in as great Ha&s;te as they came, for fear of <HI>Deaan Mundro&s;&s;er,</HI> our pre&s;ent King's Brother, who is belov'd by his Country-men, and fear'd by his Ene|mies; for we have not a greater Man in War than he, except <HI>Deaan Trongha. Ry-Opheck</HI>'s Fears and Ha&s;te were ju&s;t and proper, for <HI>Deaan Mundro&s;&s;er</HI> mu&s;ter'd an Army in a few Hours, and overtook them before they could pa&s;s the River: The Sound of his Shells made them ha&s;ten over, but &s;o precipitately that they le$t their Captives behind; and he brought mo&s;t of our Women and Chil|dren again; &s;o that we lo&s;t but little: For as to our valuable Goods, we who well knew the Danger of a Surpri&s;e, aad the Manner of the Country, had dug Holes in the Ground, and bury'd, and they had no Time to &s;earch for them. When my Father <HI>Efflep,</HI> my Bro|ther, and &s;elf return'd, we mi&s;s'd none of our Goods; but were &s;orely afflicted and &s;urpris'd to find <HI>Arnold</HI> dead and naked, for they had &s;tripp'd him of his Cloaths; but as to his <HI>Dollars,</HI> they lay neglected, and &s;catter'd up and down, till &s;ome of our own People, who knew their U&s;e and Value, took up a great many, and conceal'd them from <HI>Egla&s;&s;e.</HI> We threaten'd &s;ome of them, and made them re|turn what they had &s;tole; complaining to <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> but they were above half

He lives very hand|&s;omely tho' he lo&s;t &s;o much, having a Plan|tation of his own, and three or four Cows which give Milk; and he is able to join with my Father to buy an Ox, notwith&s;tand|ing it is a very dear Time: A good One is worth now ten <HI>Dollars.</HI> Our King <HI>Rer Vov|vern</HI> dy'd more with Grief than of his Wound in &s;ix Weeks after: He was very well-belov'd, being a good Man and gallant Warriour; al&s;o a great Friend to white Men, more e&s;pe|cially to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> But I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, here is another Family you mu&s;t be acquainted with too, and that is one <HI>Hemp&s;hire,</HI> a <HI>Guinea</HI> Negroe, who was for|merly among the Pyrates, but has been &s;ettl'd here a great While. He has a very pretty Woman to his Wife, and al&s;o a Daughter by her; the Man is blind and poor, but <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> makes him many Pre&s;ents, tho' we think it is out of Re&s;pect to his Wife; for they are very intimate.</Q></P>

Di&s;cour&s;e: Tho' <HI>James</HI> &s;aid he was only telling how Chri&s;tian-like he behav'd to <HI>Hemp&s;hire</HI> and his Family; but by this Time Dinner was rea|dy. I found my&s;elf here a perfect Negroe in my Way and Manner, for I devour'd my Meat alone, which made them laugh; but what was a greater Mortification was, <HI>Hemp&s;hire,</HI> his Wife and Child came to &s;ee me and <HI>Egla&s;&s;e;</HI> they talk'd of my Adventures in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and it &s;eem'd like unintelligible Sounds of a &s;trange Language, which I could not form my Tongue to imitate; in&s;omuch that I was in fear I &s;hould never be able to &s;peak my Mother-Tongue again: But a few Days Conver&s;ation among the&s;e People gave me Hopes of remembring it in Time. <HI>Efflep,</HI> and his Sons were next Neighbours to <HI>Egla&s;&s;e,</HI> where I was invited the next Day, and treated in a very hand&s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manner, bet|ter than at <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI>'s: Here were a Couple of Capons boil'd with <HI>Rice,</HI> like a <HI>Pilaw,</HI> al&s;o ano|ther Di&s;h of fry'd Meat and boil'd Potatoes, &s;erv'd up on Pewter-plates; &s;o that I began to think my&s;elf in a Chri&s;tian Country. They al&s;o procur'd &s;ome <HI>Toak</HI> for me, as <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> had done before; but it was &s;carce, <HI>Honey</HI> not be|ing to be got: This was made of <HI>Sugar-Canes,</HI> which were al&s;o &s;carce now, and the <HI>Toak</HI> was much inferior to what we had to the South|ward; but it was &s;trong enough to make us a little merry.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="349">
WHEN the Week was expir'd I would &s;tay no longer, tho' they importun'd me; telling them I would get Leave to come again in a &s;hort Time: Nor would I accept of a Guide, well knowing I could find the Way. When I came to the Sea-&s;ide, I &s;aw a Sail, as I thought, tho' it prov'd only a large Canoe, which was re|turning from Sea where they had been fi&s;hing; I waited till they came on Shoar, when the Men &s;eeing me white, tho' naked, came up to me, and we had a great Deal of Di&s;cour&s;e; they being very inqui&s;itive after my &s;trange Fate. I related all I could to them, and enquir'd after Shipping. At the End of our Conver&s;ation, they made me a Pre&s;ent of as much Fi&s;h as I could well carry with me. When I came home to my own Hou&s;e, I pick'd out four of the be&s;t Fi&s;h, and went to wait on my Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, pre|&s;enting each of them with two: When <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> came home he was &s;urpris'd to find Fi&s;h there, and highly pleas'd that I was come; but he would not &s;uffer me to lick his Feet. He had been all Day in the Plantations forward|ing the Work, that they might have Provi&s;ion when they return'd from the War; for every Body was bu&s;y preparing for it. He told me, he had order'd one of his Wives to make me a Cap, &s;uch as we us'd to wear to know one another by. I did not like the Propo&s;al, but there was no Help. He gave out to his Wives

<P>WHEN I return'd to my Hou&s;e I found Vi|&s;itors enough, who came to &s;ee me for the &s;ake of my Fi&s;h; but as it was cu&s;tomary, and I us'd to do &s;o my&s;elf, I could not take it ill; &s;o I &s;har'd it out as far as it would go.</P>
<P>I &s;lept but this one Night in Quiet, the next Morning I was call'd up to attend the <HI>Deaan</HI> with his Gun at the Plantation. He then thought of nothing extraordinary, but before Mid-day, came a Me&s;&s;enger running in Ha&s;te with the News, That an Army of ten thou|&s;and <HI>Saccalauvors</HI> (our Northern Enemies) were at a Town call'd <HI>Murnumbo,</HI> within ten or twelve Hours March of us. <HI>Deaean Trongha</HI> had not Patience to hear the whole Story, before he order'd his Slaves to leave Work, and go Home; the Hoes and Spades were thrown a&s;ide, and the Lances taken in Hand, every Man running Home to get ready for a March. Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent to <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> and all the other neighbouring Lords to come, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in re|pul&s;ing the Enemy. Some of the chief Men of each Town were order'd to &s;tay at Home, with a &s;ufficient Force to defend their Families and Cattle, if <HI>Woozington</HI> &s;hould be at Hand as
<PB N="331" REF="351">
as he was before, to attack the Towns by Sur|prize, while the Fighting Men were all engag'd another Way. I went Home under Pretence of whetting my Lances, but with a De&s;ign to be out of Sight and forgotten, which &s;ucceeded ac|cordingly; for they &s;oon march'd away. When I was certain they were gone, I went in great Ha&s;te to the chief Lady's Hou&s;e, asking for my Ma&s;ter; and being told he was gone, I pre|tended to be in a great Hurry to follow him, but the Women would not &s;uffer me, ordering the Men, who were left as a Guard, to &s;top me&punc; At length, I was per&s;uaded to &s;tay, and &s;at very contentedly among the Women: Mo&s;t in Town, and the Children too, were a&s;&s;embl'd at the Hou&s;e, and about it. Their Clamour, Pray|iug and Crying for their Husbands, and igno|rant Chat of the War was trouble&s;ome enough; but not &s;o bad as running the Hazard of lo&s;ing Life or Limb, in fighting the Quarrel of a Peo|ple I was not concern'd for. When I went Home at Night, I had &s;everal young Women Vi&s;itors, who &s;upp'd with me on &s;ome Carra|vances which my Mi&s;tre&s;s had giv'n me; but our Conver&s;ation was very innocent, tho' &s;ome of my wanton Readers will &s;carce credit it: But I do a&s;&s;ure them here are more mode&s;t Women, in Proportion to the Number of People than in <HI>England;</HI> even &s;uch as would re&s;i&s;t to Death, unle&s;s they were taken to Wife according to

the Cu&s;tom of the Country; and the Women which Sailors find for their Turn, are Slaves brought down to the Sea-&s;ide, and dre&s;s'd on Purpo&s;e with Beads and &s;ilk Lambers, to de|ceive their Gallants; and the Gain they make is for their Ma&s;ters, who are generous enough to pre&s;ent them with &s;ome Part of the fine Things they get From their Cullies: But if the&s;e Sailors were to go up into the Country, they would find it no ea&s;y Matter to get a Mi&s;tre&s;s. The Conver&s;ation I had with the&s;e Women put me in a melancholy Humour, in bringing to Remembrance the Plea&s;ure I us'd to enjoy in my Wife's Company; to whom, in my Opinion, they were all inferior.</P>
<P>DURING the Mens Ab&s;ence we had little el&s;e to live on but <HI>Tamarinds</HI> and A&s;hes, except a little Milk; in twelve Days they return'd, and were receiv'd with great Joy by the Wo|men. I al&s;o went with a bold A&s;&s;urance to welcome them Home, <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> rally'd me a little, but his Wife &s;aying &s;he hinder'd me from following him, I had no more &s;aid to me.</P>
<P>THE Account they gave of their Expedition was, that a General of <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI> was at the Place; but the Me&s;&s;enger's Fear aug|mented his Army to near double the Number it really was; there not being above five Thou|&s;and. Our People were &s;o &s;peedy, that they &s;ecur'd a narrow Pa&s;s, which the Enemy de|&s;ign'd
<PB N="333" REF="353">
to have taken; and after a little Skir|mi&s;hing and Bu&s;h-fighting at a Di&s;tance, <HI>Rer Mynbolambo</HI> retir'd to a Plain and encamp'd; to whom <HI>Deaan Mundro&s;&s;er</HI> &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger, de&s;i|ring to know for what Rea&s;on he (more e&s;pe|cially) march'd an Army into a Country to de&s;troy it; who&s;e late King <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> had reliev'd, and protected him when he fled from his Uncle <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI> at his Father's Death: For <HI>Rer Mynbolambo</HI>'s Father was King of <HI>Morandavo,</HI> and this Son &s;hould have &s;uc|ceeded; and there was a Di&s;pute between his Uncle and he &s;everal Years, till <HI>Rer Vovvern</HI> at la&s;t mediated a Reconciliation between them. <HI>Rer Mynbolambo</HI> an&s;wer'd in few Words, <HI>Tho&s;e Matters were made up, his &V;ncle was King, and he was under his Command, and could not help it.</HI> We under&s;tood afterwards, that <HI>Deaan Woo|zington</HI> had appointed to meet him, and had fail'd; he neverthele&s;s was loth to return Home without doing &s;omewhat, and therefore attempted to make an Incur&s;ion, and carry off a Booty of Slaves and Cattle, but was pre|vented this Time: Our Army follow'd them at a Di&s;tance to &s;ee them &s;afe in their own Coun|try, and then return'd Home them&s;elves. But that Part of the News which pleas'd me mo&s;t was, that <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> and they had a|greed to defer for this Sea&s;on, their intended Expedition with <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> again&s;t <HI>Merfaugh|la;</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="354">
for I had always a dread upon me of going into <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> as well for fear a Ship &s;hould come during the Time I &s;hould be ab&s;ent, which would be &s;ix or &s;even Months; as al&s;o for &s;ee|ing my old Ma&s;ter <HI>Deaan Mevarrow:</HI> But the&s;e Fears being di&s;&s;ipated for the pre&s;ent, I a&s;&s;i&s;ted heartily in fortifying the Town, which was done with Stones; they were here in great Plenty. None were exempted from Work, the Women and Children, according to their Strength, fetch'd Stones; and we made a Wall round the Town, at lea&s;t a Yard thick, and three Yards high, with Loop-holes to look thorow, or fire out at an Enemy. We had no Mortar, the Stones were only laid one on another; we were about two Months before we fini&s;h'd it.</P>
<P>AFTER this was done, &s;ome of our princi|pal Men got Leave to go into the Country to get Honey, and hunt wild Cattle; there being &s;ome on this Side the River <HI>Oneghaloyhe:</HI> We look'd on our&s;elves &s;afe at this Time of the Year, between <HI>November</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> the River being &s;well'd very large, and no Canoes, except here and there one; but it was impa&s;&s;able for an Army. I obtain'd my Ma&s;ter's Permi&s;&s;ion to accompany them, we were half a Day walk|ing very briskly, before we came to a Place pro|per to bait at, and where we could find <HI>Ove</HI> (that is, <HI>Wild Yams)</HI> or <HI>Su&s;ers;</HI> which here we found in Plenty: But we had a hard Day's Journey
<PB N="335" REF="355">
further to go to the Place de&s;ign'd for our Coun|try-Habitation; and when we came there we had our Hou&s;e to build. The fir&s;t Night we took Care for a good Supper; two, who well knew the Place, went to look out for Honey a|mong the Rocks, in the Holes of which the Bees make their Combs; the other of us (for there were four in all) dug <HI>Ove</HI> and <HI>Su&s;ers.</HI> Our Companions brought &s;ome Honey, and we made a delicious Supper. The next Morning we built our Hou&s;e, fini&s;hing it in half a Day; it was thatch'd with <HI>Palmetto</HI> Leaves. The next Day we employ'd our&s;elves in getting a plea&s;ant Liquor, call'd <HI>Araffer;</HI> which I had never &s;een before: The Tree from whence it comes grows like a <HI>Coco-nut</HI> Tree, but not &s;o large; rather a Kind of <HI>Palmeto,</HI> call'd in their Language <HI>Satter.</HI> The long Leaves, or Branches we burn off, leaving the Trunk bare; then we cut off a little of the Top of the Tree, and with our Lances or Hatchets make a Hole in the Middle; which in a little Time fills with a Liquid, i&s;&s;uing as from a Spring. This may be drawn, or &s;uck'd out with a Reed, as long as it will run, and it will fill again the &s;ame Day; continuing &s;ix or &s;even Days before the Tree is dry: It is not thick like a Syrup, yet very &s;weet and plea&s;ant; and I never knew it gave any One the Flux, as &s;ome may expect; nor did any Inconvenience attend the drinking it. But
<PB N="336" REF="356">
we wanted roa&s;t Meat, &s;o roving about the next Day, we e&s;py'd a Herd of about twenty of <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cattle, and with &s;ome Difficulty kill'd a Bull; and now we liv'd luxuriou&s;ly: We made drinking Cups of the Bull's Horns, thru&s;ting them into the Fire, then giving them a Knock or two to get out the Pith; and we were as well contented as &s;ome with fine Gla&s;&s;es&punc; It is indeed &s;urpri&s;ing, tho' delightful, to &s;ee how plentifully Providence has furni&s;h'd this Country with every Thing, not only nece&s;&s;ary for the Sub&s;i&s;tance of Mankind, but even a de|licious Variety. If ever any Country flow'd with Milk and Honey it is this; and with &s;o much Ea&s;e are they to be had, that as the Na|tives have no Knowledge of the Cur&s;e on <HI>Adam</HI> and his Po&s;terity; &s;o One would be tempted to think, as well for this Rea&s;on as from their Co|lour, that they are not of his Race, or that the Cur&s;e never reach'd them; for they can get their Living without the Sweat of their Brows, or at lea&s;t without That which we commonly under|&s;tand by it; which is hard Labour: Yet &s;ee how the Follies and Pa&s;&s;ions of Men lead them into Mi&s;ery, tho' they have Happine&s;s in their Power. In this fine Country their quarrelling with one another, and frequent Wars do often reduce them to the greate&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity, in the Mid&s;t of the greate&s;t Plenty almo&s;t at their Doors; but they are confin'd &s;ometimes by too

<P>BUT we liv'd now very happy and plentifully, during our Stay at our Country-hou&s;e: We made an Oven, &s;uch an One as I have before de|&s;crib'd, and bak'd our Beef; then we &s;earch'd about for Honey to carry Home: In which I, knowing more of the Nature of Bees than they, had better Fortune, and got as much as I could carry away. When our Beef grew &s;o tainted we could not eat it, we look'd out for more; it was my Fortune to overtake by my&s;elf a young Heifer, and driving her into a Thicket kill'd her; and holla'd to my Companions. This we agreed to dre&s;s, and carry as much Home as we could; we bak'd the Marrow-bones, broil'd the Liver, and &s;pread the Marrow on it, as a dainty Mor&s;el: And then we made up our <HI>En|ters,</HI> and went Home as well contented as heavy
<PB N="338" REF="358">
laden; but we were not in Ha&s;te, and therefore travell'd &s;oftly.</P>
<P>WE made it almo&s;t Midnight when we en|ter'd the Town, on Purpo&s;e that we might not be ob&s;erv'd; and now again I wi&s;h'd for my Wife to have been at Home to receive me. The next Morning I carry'd a Horn of Honey, and a Piece of Beef to the chief Lady, who was highly pleas'd, and thought I had brought too much: I went next to the other, where <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> was, and made her a Pre&s;ent; he was very glad to &s;ee me, and made a hand&s;ome Breakfa&s;t; delighting to hear me tell of our Sport: The others by this Time came accord|ing to Cu&s;tom, to pre&s;ent their Lord with &s;ome|thing of what they had got by way of Compli|ment. As I went Home a Man met me, who wanted to buy &s;ome Honey; it being blaz'd a|bout that I brought Home a great deal: He gave me a fine &s;ilk Lamber for a Callaba&s;h of Honey of about two Gallons. I thought my|&s;elf very fine in it, and I am &s;ure I was the fir&s;t of the Family that was ever dre&s;s'd &s;o like a <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Lord. <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> told me I had bought it very cheap, but that Honey was &s;carce, or it was worth four Times as much; tho' Silk is very plentiful in this Country, if they would take the Pains to gather it.</P>

<P>IN three or four Days our fine Provi&s;ion was gone, for I di&s;tributed as is u&s;ual among our Neighbours; and then we had little el&s;e but <HI>Tamarinds</HI> and A&s;hes. About three Weeks af|ter, <HI>Egla&s;&s;e,</HI> and his Man <HI>Toby</HI> came to &s;ee me, bringing Beef and Potatoes with them, for they knew our Poverty.

<P>There came five Men with a Cow to &s;ell to <HI>Egla&s;&s;e,</HI> asking me for him, and he being in the Plantation I went and told him: He came along

with me to the Men, and de&s;ir'd me to agree with them. They ask'd &s;ix Pieces of Eight, and &s;tood hard for four; but I would give them no more than three. They &s;aid if <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> would give them the old Lance in his Hand, they would take the Money. This alarm'd me, for I had ob&s;erv'd them whi&s;per two or three Times to one another; and having heard that <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> us'd to threaten the King, <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> I began to be in great Fear, and told him in <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> they wanted the Lance; and that I did not like their Behaviour, for the Lance was not worth a Meal of Potatoes, being one of his Slaves: But he in a Bravado gave the Man the Lance, <HI>Here,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I wo'n't di&s;agree; take the Lance.</HI> He had no &s;ooner deliver'd it, than a Man came behind him, and with both his Hands pu&s;h'd the Lance in at his Back &s;o forcibly, that i ca me out of his Brea&s;t.

<P>WHILE he was praying his Slaves were cut|ting up the Beef; when he had done, he or|der'd me to take the whole Brea&s;t, and the re&s;t to be divided, and &s;har'd among the People.

I had no great Mind to take his Beef; but remembring <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI> brought about his own De&s;truction, by his imprudent Behaviour, I thought it was &s;afe&s;t to appear pleas'd. <HI>Robin,</HI> the Slave, was given to the Executioner; but <HI>James</HI> bought

<HI>Toby</HI> of the King. I beg'd Leave to bury the Body, which was granted, and we return'd back to <HI>James</HI>'s Hou&s;e. The next Morning came two Me&s;&s;engers from <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> to enquire into the Truth of this Story; it having been re|ported that I was kill'd: In which Ca&s;e, they were order'd to go directly to <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> and demand Satisfaction of him, he being re|&s;olv'd to revenge $t; but it prov'd otherwi&s;e, and they having nothing to do in <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI>'s Ca&s;e, I went Home with them.</P>
<P>WHEN I arriv'd, I was receiv'd with as much Joy, as if I had been &s;ome Man of great Con&s;e|quence to them: I went to the chief Lady&punc;s Hou&s;e; where the other came on Purpo&s;e to &s;ee me, tho' &s;he had not been there in half a Year before: <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> was plea '$ too, and made me relate my &s;evere Sickne&s;s, and the frightful Tragedy of <HI>Egla&s;&s;e</HI>'s Death; &s;aying, <HI>I had &s;o many E&s;capes, that he did not think it would be my Fate to die in their Country; but that I might &s;ee</HI> England <HI>again.</HI> (Repeating his Promi&s;e to &s;end me thither.) He order'd my Hou&s;e to be re|pair'd, the Thatch being eaten by the Cattle: Provi&s;ions were given me, and appointed for Time to come; for he had lately a good Har|ve&s;t, &s;o that we liv'd much better than before.</P>
<P>I ask'd Leave one Day to pay a Vi&s;it to <HI>Rer Bafaugher;</HI> for in a Time of &s;o much Danger from Enemies, none went out of Town with|out

Leave. As I was pa&s;&s;ing by a River, and walking down, with an Intention to drink, I e&s;py'd the Track of an <HI>Alligator,</HI> which deter'd me; and there being two, or three Hou&s;es not far off, I was going toward them to beg Water, and met a young Woman with a Calaba&s;h, go|ing to dip &s;ome: She de&s;ir'd me to &s;tay, and &s;he would let me drink out of her Calaba&s;h; but going a little Way into the Water, and crouch|ing with her Knees to fill her Ve&s;&s;el, an <HI>Alliga|tor</HI> gave a Spring, and catch'd fa&s;t hold of both her Thighs, and dragg'd her into the Stream, driving down with it; but &s;he keeping her Head, and Hands above Water, I threw one Lance away, ran toward her with the other; which &s;he took hold of, and I pull'd her to me: The <HI>Alligator</HI> &s;till keeping fa&s;t hold, we calling out all this While for Help; but taking her by the Hand, &s;he directing me where the Creature lay, I &s;truck him with my Lance, and wounded him; but he did not let go till a &s;econd Stroke. By this Time Help came, and we brought her out &s;afe with only two large Wounds made with his long Jaws, and &s;harp Teeth. She was now naked, having lo&s;t her Lamber in the Scuffle; but that was not worth minding: We &s;av'd her Life, and every Body was highly pleas'd with that. <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> entertain'd me generou&s;ly, and having gratify'd his Curio&s;ity, in hearing my late dangerous Adventures, I re|turn'd Home.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="370">
THE next Day <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> told me, <HI>He had News for me:</HI> I flatter'd my&s;elf it was of a Ship's Arrival; but in the End, <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI> had &s;ent to de&s;ire him, and his People would prepare to go to and join <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> as had been be|fore projected. The Di&s;like I &s;hew'd at this, made the <HI>Deaan</HI> reproach me with Cowardice, till I told him, <HI>I ran the Ri&s;que of lo&s;ing Life, or Limb to obtain no Good; for I had no Family to re|ceive Benefit of my Fighting, and might be out of the Way, when a Ship &s;hould arrive to carry me Home; be&s;ides the Danger I was in from</HI> Deaan Mevarrow, <HI>who was known to be a Man of ungovernable Pa&s;&s;ions, and ill Principles. Deaan Trongha</HI> was &s;o good as to admit of the&s;e Rea&s;ons, and gave me his Word, <HI>He would not take me with him,</HI> &s;eeing I was unwilling to go; but a cunning <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee</HI> drew me into it, by a conjuring Stratagem, not|with&s;tanding his &s;incere Intention of keeping his Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>THE People were order'd to get ready in three Days to march, and the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee</HI> was &s;et to work to prophe&s;ie of the Succe&s;s of the War. He took &s;ome Sand, to&s;&s;ing it about, and making Scrawls with it on a Board: At length, he bid them <HI>Go, and look for an upright Tree, which lean'd no Way:</HI> Then a black, and bald-fac'd Cow was &s;ought out; which being brought to the Tree, and kill'd, the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee</HI> took &s;ome of the Blood with his Hand, &s;mear'd the Tree, and invok'd
<PB N="350" REF="371">
the <HI>Daemons,</HI> and al&s;o the <HI>Spirits</HI> of <HI>Deaan Trong|ha</HI>'s Fore-fathers; calling on them to ari&s;e, and hear what he was about to tell them; which was, <Q>&startq;That their Grand&s;on, <HI>Deaan Trongha,</HI> was going to War again&s;t their, and his old Enemy, the King of <HI>Merfaughla.&endq;</HI></Q> He next &s;et two Men of equal Strength to cut the Tree with Hatchets, one to the Northward, and the other to the Southward, to give Stroke for Stroke with each other: <HI>Saying,</HI> <Q>&startq;If the Tree fell to the Northward, bad Succe&s;s would attend the Undertaking.&endq;</Q> Tho&s;e of the Vulgar who were pre&s;ent, &s;tood &s;tupidly gaping to &s;wallow every Divine Word that came out of this wonder-working Prophet's Mouth. I don't know how the Mi&s;take came, but the Tree fell to the Norward, tho' it was certainly de&s;ign'd to fall the other way; for when <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> perceiv'd it, he only &s;mil'd: <Q>&startq;Let us cut up the Beef, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and be merry, that's the be&s;t Part of the Ceremony. We forgot to ob&s;erve that what little Wind there is, is to the Southward: We &s;hould have cho&s;e a a fitter Time.&endq;</Q> But he &s;trictly enjoin'd all pre&s;ent to &s;ay nothing at Home to the Women; &s;o we told them when we return'd that the Tree fell to the Southward, that they &s;hould tell their husbands &s;o.</P>
<P>THIS Conduct of <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s confirm'd me in a Su&s;picion I had entertain'd for &s;ome Time,

that &s;ome of the&s;e Lords, who are Men of Sen&s;e, keep one of the&s;e <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ees</HI> out of Policy, only to amu&s;e the common People; who here, as well as in other Places mu&s;t be humour'd in their Bi|gotry, and captivated by &s;uch Artifices, which politick Governours know very well; tho' they re$ard very little them&s;elves what the Conju|rors &s;ay, of their talking, and having Familia|rity with the <HI>Demy-Gods,</HI> and <HI>Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>NOW here was a &s;eeming ill Omen, and too many vulgar minded Men had &s;een it, to be tru&s;ted with the Secret: An Expedient mu&s;t therefore be found to avert it.

He bound them up in a Clout, and fixt it on the Top of a Stick, about the Length, and Bigne&s;s of a Walking-Cane. This was a Charm, which was to work terrible Mi&s;chief on the Enemy: He gave it a Name, calling it the <HI>E|lodge;</HI> it was to be carried before the Army: But who &s;hould be a proper Per&s;on to do this was &s;till a Que&s;tion, and the <HI>Daemons</HI> were to be con&s;ulted again on this important Part of

Why then, &s;ays the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee,</HI> you mu&s;t think of &s;ome|body el&s;e if you can.&endq;</Q> And away he went, for he had done his Bu&s;ine&s;s, leaving the <HI>Deaan</HI> in no &s;mall Concern, who was a Man of nice Ho|nour, and a &s;trict Ob&s;erver of his Word: But he &s;ent for me, and told me, <Q>&startq;It lay in my Power to do a piece of Service of great Importance to the whole Country, and more e&s;pecially to him&s;elf, that I &s;hould be well rewarded for it, but he de&s;ir'd I would promi&s;e fir&s;t. <HI>I an&s;wer'd,</HI> If it is not to kill a Man, I would be glad of an Opportunity to do him any Service.&endq;</Q> He then told me the whole Story, and that there was no Help for it, or he would not have ask'd it of me. I paus'd a little, but &s;oon recollected my&s;elf, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;All I fear'd was what I had already told him; but &s;ince there was a Nece&s;&s;ity I readily &s;ubmitted. <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> He would protect me, and take as much Care of my Life and Health as of his own:&endq;</Q> And immediately order'd a Slave to attend me, and every Thing to be got ready for me.

This was to

be done till we &s;hould fight with <HI>Woozington</HI>'s Army: I was to have ten Beeves and two Slaves for my Trouble. The common People look on this to have a poi&s;onous Effect, and that's the Rea&s;on I was to wa&s;h before I came near any of them; but <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> told me, <Q>&startq;&endq;He knew I did not think it hurtful. No Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I know there is no Harm, nor Good in it, and they &s;hall &s;ee me lick it before their Fa|ces; which none of them would do for an hundred Oxen. I can never think, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> that you depend as much on it as you tell them, but you &s;ee the ill Con&s;equence of u&s;ing the&s;e Conjurers; for the Vulgar are &s;o per|&s;uaded of their Power over them by the&s;e Charms, that if your own Life was in Dan|ger you mu&s;t do what he &s;ays his Demy-Gods direct, if it was to carry this your&s;elf. This is very true, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and if I was to refu&s;e to let you carry it, they would refu&s;e to march; or if they did, would charge me with every Mi&s;carriage or Misfortune.

IN two or three Days after we march'd out of Town, I had a Slave to carry my Mat and Pro|vi&s;ion, like a great Man, every Thing being plentifully provided for me: Now came the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee,</HI> and put the <HI>Elodge</HI> in my left Hand, and I march'd before them.

We pa&s;s'd the great River <HI>Oneghaloyhe,</HI> wading thorow a &s;hallow Place a great Way above where I had pa&s;s'd it before.

However I forc'd him to fetch two Guns, that I might fire them into the Water to

&s;care away the <HI>Alligators;</HI> and then I went on. We &s;aw &s;everal People belonging to two petty Princes not far off, who were here hunting: Our People had &s;ome Conver&s;ation with them, for they were not Enemies. We pa&s;s'd thorow the mountainous Wilderne&s;s, but lay no more than two Nights in it; for they knew a much better Way than I did when I came by my&s;elf. The Day I &s;aw <HI>Vohitch futey,</HI> I return'd very melancholy into the Camp; in&s;omuch that <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> took Notice, and ask'd <HI>What was the Matter?</HI> I told him, <Q>&startq;We were now coming into <HI>Anterndroea,</HI> which had been a Scene of Mi&s;ery to me, and I had a Dread of <HI>Deaan Mevarrow.&endq;</HI></Q> But he chear'd me up, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;They dur&s;t not venture to wrong me, and he was &s;ure they would not as well out of Fear, as out of Re&s;pect to him.</Q></P>
<P>THE next Day we arriv'd at <HI>Madamvovo,</HI> the River where I us'd to water my Cattle in <HI>Deaan Murnanzack</HI>'s Country.

I was de&s;ir'd to tell my own Story, which I did to his Satisfaction. He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&endq;I had taken a great deal of Pains for Liberty, but it was no more than he would

<P>THE next Day came <HI>Deaan Crindo,</HI> and his Sons; and with them <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> and his Brother: I was &s;orry to find he was recover'd of the <HI>Yaws,</HI> but I ventur'd to go to &s;ee him, choo&s;|ing a Time when I found he and his Brother were together; and after the u&s;ual Ceremony of licking their Feet, and their &s;aying they were glad to &s;ee me, they ask'd me, <HI>Why I left them?</HI> I pretended when the Army parted I would re|turn again, if he would give me my Wife. They both told me, She would not be marry'd to any other Man, but continu'd con&s;tantly lamenting for me. This brought unfeigned Tears from me, and made them the ea&s;ier to be deceiv'd by my Flatteries. I would not have attempted this Piece of Deceit, had I not been in Fear he would have privately murder'd me, when he found I contemn'd, or hated him. At Night I acquainted <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> with what I had done, for Fear he &s;hould have &s;u&s;pected I was carry|ing on &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter &s;ecret De&s;ign in vi&s;iting <HI>Me|varrow.</HI> I met here with my former tru&s;ty Friend, who had all this While kept my Se|cret: He al&s;o told me, that my Wife remain'd incon&s;olable, and repented every Day to him, that &s;he did not go with me.</P>
<P>AFTER two or three Days, the Army, which now con&s;i&s;ted of about four thou&s;and, march'd;

and I went before them with the <HI>Elodge.</HI> The next Day we enter'd the Country of <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> and here the Army divided into three Parts, as in the former Expedition, marching with more Circum&s;pection than before; for we were in an Enemy's Country, I &s;till in the Front. As we were pa&s;&s;ing between the two Woods, on a &s;udden, a Volley of Shot was fir'd at me; I &s;aw the Enemy run away as &s;oon as they fir'd. They were a &s;mall Party, skulking about on Purpo&s;e to look for &s;uch Opportunities. The Shot whi&s;t|led about my Ears, and &s;ome &s;mall Boughs fly|ing off from the Trees, and &s;triking me, I could not tell at fir&s;t, whether I was not wounded. However I &s;topp'd, and was re&s;olv'd to proceed no further. <HI>Deaan Tredaughe</HI> being the neare&s;t Commander, call'd to me to go on; which I peremptorily refus'd, except they would &s;end a Party to march before.

I was enrag'd beyond Decency, at the Haughtine&s;s of him whom I had &s;o much Rea|&s;on to hate; and told him, <Q>&startq;He was a proud Prince, and that I thank'd God I was out of his Power. <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> It was true; or he would have prevented my going any fur|ther.&endq;</Q> <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> was now come for|ward,

<P>In two Days more we arriv'd at the River, where we had encamp'd, fought, and defeated <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> before, and kill'd his &s;tout General <HI>Ry-Opheck.</HI> Here we encamp'd again, and no Enemy appearing, mo&s;t were for plun|dering the Country, but <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI> per|&s;uaded them again&s;t it, and advis'd marching &s;till on to find out the Enemy; if po&s;&s;ible be|fore they divided their Force into &s;mall Par|ties: I did not care how &s;oon we came to a Bat|tle, that I might get rid of the <HI>Elodge.</HI></P>
<P>AT length after four Days March, a Body of the Enemy of about a thou&s;and &s;hew'd them|&s;elves on a Plain in our Sight; and <HI>Deaan Trong|ha</HI> drew out his Country-men to fight them.

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;ABOUT Sun-ri&s;e, a Man came to the Gene|ral, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> There appear'd a Party of about fifty of the Enemy in the Plain, on which he march'd his little Army out of the Wood where he lay toward them, and &s;oon &s;aw them increa&s;e in Number; but he was re&s;olv'd to attack them. Here he committed an Error, forgetting that the <HI>Anterndroeans</HI> are good for little el&s;e, but Bu&s;h-fighting. When they
<PB N="362" REF="383">
came nearer, another Party appear'd; and &s;oon after, a third: However, here was no going back. Some of the <HI>Anterndroeans,</HI> in|deed, ran away, and Others skulk'd down in the high Gra&s;s; &s;o that there were not above three&s;core Men of his own <HI>Feraingher</HI> People, &s;tood with him again&s;t &s;ome hundreds. They maintain'd the Fight half the Morning: The General receiv'd two Wounds without falling; at length, a third kill'd him. There were not by this Time above twenty of his Party left, and they re&s;olutely forc'd their Way thorow the Enemy; of which Number were the Three, who gave us this Account of it. The <HI>Anterndroea</HI> Men, who lay hid in the Gra&s;s, were mo&s;t of them kill'd; for the Gra&s;s being exceeding long, and very dry (at this Time of the Year in this hot Country) the Enemy &s;et Fire to it, and it run along like a wild Fire, &s;corching the Men who lay hid under it; &s;o that they were forc'd to ri&s;e, and were mo&s;t of them over-taken,</Q> and &s;lain.</P>
<P>THE Death of this great Man was a &s;en&s;ible Lo&s;s to the whole Army, and &s;incerely lamented by every Body: It was a mortifying Stroke to me, and I remain'd incon&s;olable, not knowing what Evil might attend me in this Country. <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> did not return till ten Days after, when he brought a good Prize of Cattle, and Slaves; but his Joy was all damp'd at once with
<PB N="363" REF="384">
the News of his Brother's Death; which &s;o &s;hock'd, and &s;urpris'd him, that he was not e|nough compos'd to talk of any Affairs of the Army till the next Day. I had carry'd on the Deceit with <HI>Mevarrow</HI> of pretending that I would come privately to him, when the Army broke up; but was very unea&s;y, till I got an Opportu|nity to communicate my whole Project to <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> and beg his Protection, which he rea|dily promis'd: And it was agreed that I &s;hould ab&s;ent my&s;elf two or three Days before they &s;e|parated, in order to make <HI>Deaan Mevarrow</HI> think I ran away from the <HI>Feraingher</HI> People, and went to his Town before him; when, indeed, I, and my Man only went to a Place appointed, walk|ing by Night to prevent Di&s;covery, and &s;tay'd till <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> and the re&s;t arriv'd.</P>
<P>THE &s;everal Parties who were &s;ent out to plunder, return'd, and the Cattle being divi|ded, which were &s;everal Thou&s;ands, be&s;ides Slaves; the Army decamp'd. The <HI>Feraingher</HI> People did not accompany the <HI>Anterndroeans</HI> Home, as before; but took their Leave here, and departed, going a much nearer Way, direct|ly homeward. I went away with my Servant, as was &s;ecretly agreed on with <HI>Rer Bafaugher,</HI> and met them according to Appointment, to the great Surpri&s;e of the People; for there had been a &s;trict Search, and Inquiry made after me, every one thinking I was lo&s;t. <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI>
<PB N="364" REF="385">
made &s;o great a Clamour with <HI>Deaan Mevarrow,</HI> and &s;ome Others, that <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> gave him two Slaves to appea&s;e him; fearing a Quarrel of dangerous Con&s;equence would have en&s;u'd. One of the Slaves, a young Man, <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> made me a Pre&s;ent of. I was &s;urpris'd not know|ing what he meant by it, till relating the whole Story, and &s;aying, <HI>That both were by right mine.</HI> I was &s;atisfy'd, calling my Slave's Name <HI>Sambo.</HI> We were near a Month before we pa&s;s'd over the River <HI>Oneghaloybe,</HI> &s;pending our Time vo|luptuou&s;ly in hunting, eating, and drinking, making very &s;hort Marches. We did this chiefly to feed our Captives, for their Country was &s;o ruin'd by us, that for many Months they had very little to live on; &s;o that the poor Wretches look'd very thin.</P>
<P>WHEN we came within one, or two Days Jour|ney of <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI>'s, the Cattle were &s;har'd, and tho&s;e who had two, or more Slaves, pre|&s;ented one to their Lord, according to the &s;ame Law, and Cu&s;tom which I have already related is us'd in <HI>Anterndroea;</HI> and now I thought it a proper Time to mention to <HI>Rer Befaugher</HI> what I was promis'd as a Reward, for carrying the <HI>Eledge;</HI> and told him, <HI>The Fatigue, and Hazard I underwent did well de&s;erve it.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>There would have been no Objection again&s;t it if</HI> Deaan Trongha <HI>had liv'd: However, he would go to</HI> Deaan Mun|dro&s;&s;er, <HI>and &s;ee what could be done.</HI> Soon return|ing

with five Cows, and a little after a Girl Slave was &s;ent me; but I having already a Man, which was enough for my U&s;e, I de&s;ir'd to have two Cows in the Room of the Girl, which they readily agreed to. I committed my Cattle to my Man <HI>Sambo</HI>'s Care, and the Man who at|tended me, when I went out was their Guard; for he would not leave me till we got Home.</P>
<P>WHEN we came to <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI>'s Town, I left my Slave, and Cattle, and went to <HI>Deaan Trongha</HI>'s Town to &s;ee his Widows. I found a melancholy Scene: The elde&s;t Lady would have had me live with her. <HI>I told her,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;I could not think my&s;elf &s;afe, but under the Protection of &s;ome great Man, as <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> was; but I &s;hould have Opportunities of coming often to &s;ee her, and would for ever &s;hew the Value I had for the Memory of my dear Lord, and al&s;o my Gratitude for all her former Favours.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN I return'd, I met my Man <HI>Sambo,</HI> who told me, <HI>He was going to build a Hou&s;e,</HI> when <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> &s;ent, and provided one for me, giving him al&s;o the nece&s;&s;ary Furniture for it.

<P><HI>Deaan Mundumbo,</HI> after his Father's Death, attempted to a&s;&s;ume the &s;upreme Command, as King; but had not Magnanimity enough to maintain his Pretention, nor Love enough of the People to &s;tand in any Degree in Competi|tion with <HI>Deaan Murnanzack.</HI> He wanted tho&s;e few good Qualities which his Father had; for it mu&s;t be allow'd, that <HI>Crindo</HI> had Vigour in War, and the Spirit of Authority at Home, which alone &s;upported his Dignity, and made him u&s;e|ful

to his Country. <HI>Murnanzack</HI> had his Uncle's Fire in War, and Maje&s;ty at Home, with the Addition of all the human, and &s;ocial Vertues, and was, indeed, a truly great Man; &s;o that <HI>Mundumbo</HI> was forc'd to fly into <HI>Anteno&s;a</HI> for the Pre&s;ent till Matters were &s;ettled, and what be|came of either of them after, I never knew; for I was not long after this mov'd into another Country, &s;till farther from <HI>Anterndroea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI> treated me as hand&s;omely as his Brother had done. He had but one Wife, with whom he had liv'd nine Years, and was &s;o unfortunate as to have no Child. She was a mo&s;t agreeable, and good natur'd Woman, and behav'd her&s;elf &s;o well that he lov'd her, and prefer'd her to all the Women in the World: She was al&s;o generally re&s;pected, and extreamly kind to me. Three of my Cows gave Milk, and they furni&s;hing me with <HI>Carravances,</HI> and <HI>Guinea-Corn,</HI> I, and my Man <HI>Sambo</HI> liv'd very well. This continu'd all the Rain-time, and we planted and &s;ow'd, but never &s;tay'd to reap. For,</P>
<P>NEWS was brought by &s;ome People, who liv'd a great Way off, that <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> was marching toward us with a great Army.

Cattle, Wives, and Slaves to the River <HI>Fe|raingher,</HI> which runs by <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI>'s Town. I was &s;o careful of my little Stock, that I accom|panied them to the River, and went my&s;elf to <HI>James</HI>'s Hou&s;e (the Son of <HI>Efflep)</HI> where I found <HI>Hemp&s;hire,</HI> his Wife, and Daughter. Two Days after, hearing that <HI>Woozington</HI> had pa&s;s'd <HI>Oneg|haloyhe,</HI> we were order'd farther to the North|ward to <HI>Murnumbo;</HI> where we had not been three Days, but we were alarm'd with wor&s;e News, of an Army of <HI>Saccalauvors</HI> being ju&s;t ready to at|tack us: From The&s;e we were forc'd to retreat immediately, and hearing that <HI>Woozington</HI> had not penetrated &s;o far as the River <HI>Feraingher,</HI> we attempted to go back again there; but the <HI>Sacca|lauvor</HI> Army was &s;o clo&s;e at our Heels, that we were forc'd to fly for our Lives, and leave our Cattle to them; ha&s;tening as fa&s;t as we could to the River. Some of our People who had Arms, made a Running-fight to &s;ave the Women, and Children. We reach'd to the River, but they were in Sight of us by this Time. <HI>Hemp&s;hire</HI>'s Wife ran away from him, I, out of Compa&s;&s;ion, took him by the Hand, and made him run with me into the very &s;ame Cane-thicket where I fled at the Death of <HI>Egla&s;&s;e.</HI> We were not long &s;at down there before we heard &s;ome Women, and Children cry out, who were taken but a little Way from us in the &s;ame Thicket; which put us into the utmo&s;t Fear: For we could expect
<PB N="369" REF="390">
nothing but immediate Death. We had not &s;at trembling long under the&s;e frightful Apprehen|&s;ions before I e&s;py'd them We got up to run I knew not where; but one of them fir'd, and &s;hot <HI>Hemp&s;hire</HI> in at the Back, on which he fell dead. I was too nimble for my Pur&s;uer, and was got out of his Reach; but ju&s;t at the En|trance of the Thicket, I met another Man run|ning directly at me: He took a Lance to throw, but I call'd out to him, begg'd my Life, and <HI>&s;aid,</HI> "I would go with him." He &s;eeing me without any Weapons (for I had neither Lance, nor Gun) bid me come forward; &s;o I went and lick'd his Feet, &s;ubmitting my&s;elf to be his Slave, <HI>he told me,</HI> <Q>&startq;He &s;av'd my Life becau&s;e I was a white Man, and un-arm'd.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>HE took me with him into the Body of the Army, and it was &s;oon &s;pread about, that a white Man was taken Pri&s;oner; in&s;omuch that the Ge|neral heard of it, and &s;ent for my Conqueror, and me. When I came before him, I kneel'd, and lick'd his Feet: He ask'd, if any Body could &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> and was &s;urpris'd I &s;poke in his own Language to him. He ask'd me &s;everal Que&s;tions relating to the Strength of <HI>Deaan Mernaugha,</HI> and the Number of his Peo|ple, and other Things of that Nature, which I as cunningly avoided an&s;wering as was po&s;&s;i|ble for <HI>Rer Bafaugher</HI>'s &s;ake; but in the End of the Conver&s;ation, he gave the Man, who&s;e Pri|&s;oner
<PB N="370" REF="391">
I was, another Slave, and took me him|&s;elf; at which I was a little better pleas'd than with him: For it was wretched indeed to be a Slave's Slave. My new Ma&s;ter bid me follow him, which I did while they march'd, which was not long; for they encamp'd &s;oon after o$ the Banks of the River. This was the fine&s;t Camp I had &s;een, for it was full of good Tents; when the General's Tent was erected, he de&s;ir'd me to &s;it down, and tell him how I came upon the I&s;land; and how it came to pa&s;s, that I be|ing a white Man &s;poke their Language. I gra|tify'd him by relating my whole Hi&s;tory, which he li&s;ten'd to very attentively, and we had a great deal of Talk about my &s;urpri&s;ing Adven|tures. After he had &s;een me &s;up, (I did not eat with him) he gave one of his principal Men Charge of me, to &s;ee I wanted for nothing, but never bid him guard me; and when one of his People advis'd him to it, he &s;aid' <Q>&startq;There was no Fear of my going away, for white Men have no Home on this I&s;land; all Places are alike to them, and they will &s;tay with them longe&s;t who treat them be&s;t, and feed them well; which could not be done, he was &s;ure, by the People of <HI>Feraingher</HI> at pre&s;ent.&endq;</Q> And he was certainly right; for I fed &s;o heartily this Evening, having eat no Beef a long Time, that I was &s;ick. And when I came to con&s;ider, that Ships eome to this Country, and the poor
<PB N="371" REF="392">
Condition of <HI>St. Augu&s;tine Bay</HI> render'd it very unlikely they &s;hould come to trade there; I did not find, but I was by this Providence likely to get &s;ooner to <HI>England</HI> than any other Place where I had yet been: And the General judg'd very rightly, for I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s to go away from them, I could not mend my Circum&s;tances; &s;o having my Liberty to go up and down where I pleas'd, I went to &s;ee who I knew of the Cap|tives, and found <HI>Hemp&s;hire</HI>'s Wife and Daugh|ter, <HI>Toby</HI> and <HI>Robin,</HI> and my own Man <HI>Sambo;</HI> I took him by the Hand, and &s;aid, <HI>I was a Slave as well as he.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>He had rather have &s;erv'd me, for he &s;hould not live &s;o well.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER the General had &s;atisfy'd him&s;elf with enquiring after me, I had al&s;o the &s;ame Curio|&s;ity to know who it was I had for a Ma&s;ter, and was inform'd he was known by the Names <HI>Rer Towlerpherangha</HI> and <HI>Rer Vove.</HI> Now it is com|mon for great Men to have two Names, and the la&s;t being the mo&s;t in U&s;e, I &s;hall for the future di&s;tingui&s;h him by that only. He was Grand|&s;on to <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo,</HI> King of <HI>Saccalau|vor;</HI> which is call'd by <HI>Europeans Yong-Owl,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Morandavo,</HI> from a River of that Name. The Man to who&s;e Care <HI>Rer Vove</HI> recommended me was named <HI>Guy,</HI> he was a principal Man and di&s;tant Relation of the King's Family. All the great Families here have a general Name of Di|&s;tinction, on which they value them&s;elves, as

mo&s;t Gentlemen in <HI>Europe</HI> do by their <HI>Coat of Arms.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;tay'd here two Days, expecting <HI>Deaan Woozington</HI> would by this Time have made his Way thorow the Country on the other Side, and join'd us, but were in orm'd that <HI>Rer Ba|faugher,</HI> by his timely Care, had &s;topp'd &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages, and defended others &s;o well, that he was glad to retire without effecting any Thing. Our General on this News retir'd to <HI>Murnumbo,</HI> hoping that <HI>Deaan Mernaugha</HI> would be ra&s;h enough to follow, and fight him; but <HI>Mer|naugha</HI> wi&s;ely cho&s;e to re&s;t for this Time con|tented with his pre&s;ent Lo&s;s, rather &s;acri|fice all to a fooli&s;h Notion of Revenge and fal&s;e Valour, more ju&s;tly call'd Pride and Pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>Rer Vove</HI> &s;eeing no more could be done, after re|maining here &s;even or eight Days, till the Parties which were &s;ent out were return'd; he march'd homeward, and in&s;tead of putting me under a Guard as others were, he gave me a Blunder|bu&s;s, and made me a Guardian over &s;everal of my late Country-folks, bidding me &s;hoot any who &s;hould attempt to run away.</P>
<P>AMONG the re&s;t who were under my Care was <HI>Hemp&s;hire</HI>'s Widow, and three other Wo|men, who one Evening as I attended them into a private Place in a Wood, told me, <Q>&startq;&endq;It was hard to &s;ee them&s;elves guarded by one who but lately fought, and defended them; <HI>telling</HI>

<P>WE made very &s;hort Marches, yet &s;oon ar|riv'd to the Borders of <HI>Saccalauvor;</HI> which was not inhabited: It is a fine Country, and I &s;aw a great many different kinds of <HI>Monkies, Ba|boons,</HI> and <HI>Virjees,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>wild Swine</HI> in Abun|dance; but none of <HI>Hattoy</HI>'s Cattle.</P>
<P>IN three Days after we pa&s;s'd by &s;everal of the Towns belonging to <HI>Rer Mynbolambo,</HI> alias <HI>Moiang Andro;</HI> it being the very Country which <HI>Rer Vovvern,</HI> late King of <HI>Feraingher,</HI> procur'd for him, by Treaty of his Uncle <HI>Rer Trimmo|nongarcvo.</HI>

I &s;aw in the Towns and Meadows more of the hump'd Cattle, and larger than I had ever &s;een in any Part of the I&s;land before; but was told, that the&s;e were only near Home for U&s;e; the King and Lords having their prin|cipal Stock of Cattle a great Way further to the Northward, and in &s;uch Numbers, that they don't know how many they have; which I af|terward found true to my Amazement. Our Army now le&s;&s;en'd apace, People going Home as they came near the Towns they belong'd to, without taking Leave of the General; having no Pay to take, or demand: For every One is &s;en&s;ible that it is for his own Intere&s;t to join with his Neighbours, and prevent Enemies from plundering them; never muttering at their Generals for leading them out to War, knowing it is their own Cau&s;e, and not the Ge|neral's, which they engage in: For if they &s;aw their Lords impos'd on them, they would re|fu&s;e to go; and could ea&s;ily remove, and live under others. They fight for their own Safety and Felicity, and if they get any Plunder from their Enemies, they think them&s;elves over|paid.</P>
<P><HI>Moharb$</HI> is the chief Town, or rather City and Re&s;idence of the King, our General's Grand|father, to whom he mu&s;t pay a Vi&s;it before he went Home. When we came within a Mile or two, for Form-&s;ake three Me&s;&s;engers were di&s;|patch'd
<PB N="375" REF="396">
to acquaint him of our Approach, and to know his Plea&s;ure; who return'd for An|&s;wer that <HI>Rer Vove</HI> might come, he was ready to receive him. On which he put his People in Order, appointing fifty Men to go in the Front, and fire their Guns; then to be reliev'd by fifty more; the Shells all this While &s;ound|ing. As we approach'd within Sight of the King, who was &s;itting with his Courtiers and other People, we heard their Shells &s;ound and Drums beat; tho' they made but a dull, Tub|like Sound for Congratulatory Mu&s;ick, being indeed &s;omewhat like this Country Tubs, made of a light Tree hollow'd, and very thin, cover'd with a Calf's Skin dre&s;s'd like our Parchment. They beat both Ends at once, one with a Stick, and the other with the Hand.</P>
<P>THIS King lives in a more grand Manner, than any I had hitherto &s;een: He has 20 or 30 Hou&s;es, or rather a Court within Palli&s;adoes in the Town; but it not being large enough to receive &s;o many People, he was on this Occa&s;ion &s;itting without the Town. Our fir&s;t fifty Men ad|vanc'd capering, and firing their Guns regularly one after another: Then they retreated, and the other fifty advanc'd. After this the Gene|ral went forward, and kneeling on one Knee lick'd the King's Knee: Several principal Men &s;aluted him with their Knee but lick'd his Feet; then a Mat was laid at four Yards Di|&s;tance,
<PB N="376" REF="397">
and the General, and three, or four of the Chiefs (among whom was <HI>Guy)</HI> &s;at down; I &s;tood behind my Ma&s;ter with my Blunderbu&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS King, <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo,</HI> made a very odd, and, as I thought, terrible Figure; whe|ther it was becau&s;e I had heard Stories of &s;ome of his ra&s;h, and barbarous Actions, which had prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd me: But his Dre&s;s was &s;uch I had never &s;een any like it; his Hair was twi&s;ted in Knots, beginning at the Crown of his Head, making a &s;mall Ring; then another Ring of Knots bigger than that, and &s;o on downward, every Circle larger than the upper; on &s;everal of the&s;e Knots of Hair hung &s;ome fine Beads: He had a Fore-head Piece of Beads &s;o low, that &s;ome of them hung over his No&s;e; among the&s;e were &s;everal gold Beads: About his Neck was a very fine gold Necklace, over his Shoulders, in the Manner of an Alderman's Chain, hung two Strings of Beads, &s;everal of them gold; on each Wri&s;t about &s;ix <HI>Mannelers</HI> of Silver, &s;eeming large enough to weigh near three Dol|lars apiece; and four Rings of Gold on his Fingers. On each Ancle were near twenty Strings of Beads &s;trung very clo&s;e, al&s;o &s;itting very clo&s;e to his Legs; a &s;ilk Lamber like a Mantle over his Shoulders, and another as u&s;ual about his Wa&s;te. He was an old Man, not le&s;s, by what I could find, than four&s;core Years of Age; yet of a robu&s;t and hardy Con&s;titution:
<PB N="377" REF="398">
His Colour rather tawny, like an <HI>Indian,</HI> than black; his Eyes fierce, and his whole Appear|ance frightful, or his &s;ingular Habit and Cha|racter made me think &s;o; he &s;oon e&s;py'd me, and ask'd <HI>Rer Vove</HI> if I was the white Man whom he took Pri&s;oner, and my Name. He call'd to me, <HI>Robin mehove a toee,</HI> which is, <HI>Come hither.</HI> I laid down my Blunderbu&s;s, and walk'd toward him with my Hands lifted up, and clos'd be|fore me. When I came to him I kneel'd down, and lick'd fir&s;t one Foot, and then the other; as I &s;aw the meaner People do before. He bid me &s;it down by him, but not &s;o familiar as on his Mat. He ask'd &s;everal Que&s;tions of my coming on this I&s;land, and told me he had a white Man him&s;elf; <Q>&startq;&endq;but, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> he is an <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> and I don't know if you &s;peak his Language. <HI>I told him,</HI></Q> I was an <HI>Engli&s;h-man.</HI> I began to have more Courage now, hearing him &s;ay he kept an <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> him&s;elf, and wonder'd that my Ma&s;ter had not mention'd this before. I ask'd the King <HI>How long he had been with him? and his Name.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>Six or &s;even Years, and his Name was</HI> Will. He order'd a Man to go immediately, and call him; who return'd with an An&s;wer, that <HI>Will</HI> was gone out of Town, and would not be back in three or four Days; &s;o finding the King begin another Di&s;cour&s;e to the General, I retir'd to my former Po&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="399">
AFTER a While we went to a Hou&s;e ap|pointed for our Reception; where my Ma&s;ter di&s;charg'd me from guarding the Slaves: <HI>Say|ing,</HI> <Q>&startq;He did that only to try my Fidelity, for he was &s;ure if I had not been hone&s;t they would have made their E&s;cape; and finding me faithful, he had a Tru&s;t of greater Im|portance to commit to my Care.&endq;</Q> By this Time came in <HI>Ry Chemotoea,</HI> the King's Head-Wife, and Grandmother to <HI>Rer Vove:</HI> She was the bigge&s;t Woman I had ever &s;een in my Life. When &s;he &s;at, her Brea&s;ts hung in her Lap, &s;he never walk'd much; but was carried on a Thing like a Bier, on Mens Shoulders. She had a great many Attendants, be&s;ides Slaves, who brought four Calaba&s;hes of <HI>Toak,</HI> two of <HI>Honey,</HI> and two of <HI>Sugar-canes;</HI> al&s;o &s;ix Baskets of <HI>Rice.</HI> The King &s;ent ten <HI>Beeves,</HI> four of them very large, and fat <HI>Oxen. Ry Chemotoea</HI> was no &s;ooner gone, than we &s;at down to drinking the <HI>Honey-Teak,</HI> till <HI>Rer Vove</HI> was very merry, and fell a|&s;leep; when three Slaves came from his Grand|mother; One with a fat <HI>Capon</HI> boil'd (for they make <HI>Capons</HI> here); Another with a Pot full of <HI>Rice</HI> boil'd dry; and the Third with a Basket, a wooden Di&s;h, and a Spoon. This was the be&s;t Supper I had &s;een of the Natives dre&s;&s;ing, and I had my Part of it; but for all this good Cheer, I could not help thinking of this <HI>Will,</HI> the <HI>Eng|li&s;h-man,</HI> and was concern'd that we could not &s;tay till he came Home.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="400">
THE next Day we march'd homewards, it was two Days Journey; but we ha&s;ted to come in early the &s;econd Day, becau&s;e of the great Triumph we were to make at our Entrance; which was much the &s;ame as I have de&s;crib'd in other Places, of their Wives licking their Feet, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Rer Vove</HI>'s Hou&s;e was &s;even, or eight Yards long, and &s;ix broad, built of Boards, as are all the great Mens Hou&s;es in <HI>Saccalauvor,</HI> tho' they have no Saws; but with a great deal of Labour hew out Boards very even with Hatchets. The Language differs not from that in other Coun|tries, except as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> or the We&s;t of <HI>England;</HI> where each Place has &s;ome particu|lar Words, and a little Difference in Pronoun|ciation.</P>
<P>MY Po&s;t here was a grand one, for I was made Captain of my Ma&s;ter's Guard. His Hou&s;e was enclos'd in Palli&s;ades, at the Gate of which was a little Hou&s;e for &s;everal Youths to lay in, who were his Guard, over whom I was appointed Chief; but this did not continue above one Month, when he &s;ingl'd me out to go with him a &s;hooting wild Fowl by our&s;elves: He then told me how vicious the People of <HI>Saccalauvor</HI> were grown, &s;ince the few Years of the Coun|try's being made rich; and that young Men, living &s;o well, and drinking too much <HI>Toak,</HI> did often lye with other Mens Wives; by which
<PB N="380" REF="401">
Means, Murders, and other Mi&s;chiefs have en&s;u'd. <Q>&startq;Now, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I have no Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect my Wife <HI>Ry Kaley,</HI> and to prevent a|ny Su&s;picion for the future, I will put her under your Care, and de&s;ire &s;he may never be be out of your Sight, by Night, or Day, on any Occa&s;ion what&s;oever; except &s;he is with me: I know &s;he will not take this ami&s;s, and you have no Bu&s;ine&s;s to mind any Body el&s;e.&endq;</Q> I return'd him Thanks for the great Opinion he had of my Fidelity, and that I would take the &s;ame Care I had hitherto done, to di&s;charge my Duty to him in any Thing he thought proper to commaud; but was afraid &s;ome tru&s;ty old Servants of his would envy me. <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> <Q>&startq;No, for a white Man is by every Body expected to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd, and preferr'd to others.&endq;</Q> When we came Home, he broke it to her with &s;uch another Apology as he did to me. She prevented him from asking her Con&s;ent, very readily apprehending him&punc; and <HI>&s;aying,</HI> <Q>&startq;She de&s;ir'd nothing more than that he would take &s;ome Method to keep always the &s;ame Opi|nion of her he then had; and hoping I was to be her Guardian, &s;he would &s;ubmit with Plea&s;ure to it: And, from this Time, <HI>Robin, &s;ays &s;he,</HI> I will never be out of your Sight, but in <HI>Rer Vove</HI>'s; and I am now under your Juri&s;diction: See you di&s;charge your Tru&s;t as you ought to do, and don't think
<PB N="381" REF="402">
you can di&s;plea&s;e me in any Thing, but in not performing your Orders &s;trictly; be&s;ides, I propo&s;e a great deal of Plea&s;ure in your Company, in telling me Stories of your Tra|vels, and Country.&endq;</Q> And indeed, &s;he gave me Rea&s;on to think &s;he was not di&s;pleas'd with my Company. I was oblig'd to attend her on all Occa&s;ions, &s;ometimes her Women Slaves were with her, and often none but our&s;elves; &s;he making Opportunities: And whether my Ma&s;ter had &s;o great an Opinion of her, as he pretended, I cannot &s;ay; but I found her to be a very wanton Woman, and was oblig'd to manage with a great deal of Art to keep her hone&s;t, as well with others, as with my&s;elf. My Life lay at Stake, and therefore I was re|&s;olv'd to be faithful. She was under my Care three Quarters of a Year, before I got rid of this trouble&s;ome Charge; during which Time, my Ma&s;ter took another Woman to Wife, if One may call it &s;o: She had lately been di|vorc'd from a Cou&s;in of his. He was very fond of her for a little While; but &s;oon quarrell'd with her, beat her, and turn'd her away; re|turning with as much Fondne&s;s to my Charge, <HI>Ry Kaley,</HI> again.</P>
<P>A little after this, <HI>Rer Vove</HI> would take a Journey to the Northward for Plea&s;ure, and to &s;ee his Cattle; &s;o ordering his Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff to be remov'd to his Head-&s;lave's till he re|turn'd,
<PB N="382" REF="403">
our Hou&s;e was &s;hut up, and we march'd away: We were a large Company; <HI>Ry Kaley</HI> his Wife, his Friend <HI>Guy,</HI> with &s;everal others, be&s;ides Slaves. It was ju&s;t as the Rains were o|ver; &s;o coming to a &s;mall River, which was &s;well'd with the Floods, the People were at a Stand, not caring to go thorow it ra&s;hly; le&s;t <HI>Alligators</HI> might have come up into the Mar&s;hes, as is u&s;ual, and return again to their old Haunts when the Waters fell. The River was &s;hallow enough to wade, and I, being fool|hardy, would out of a Bravado go fir&s;t. Two fine Dogs which my Ma&s;ter lov'd, went into the Water with me, and kept clo&s;e, one on each Side; for the Dogs are &s;en&s;ible of <HI>Alligators.</HI> I was about up to my Belly in the Water, when an <HI>Alligator</HI> gave &s;uch a &s;udden, and violent Spring at the Dog on my left Side, that the <HI>Alligator</HI>'s No&s;e &s;truck me down. The <HI>Alliga|tor,</HI> Dog, and I, di&s;appearing at once, the Peo|ple thought I had been carry'd away; but ri|&s;ing, and finding my&s;elf not hurt, I went over, and they all follow'd me; for if there are a Number of People, and a Noi&s;e is made, an <HI>Alligator</HI> will &s;ink to the Bottom like a Stone, and lye as motionle&s;s; that if you tread on him he will not &s;tir. We march'd &s;lowly, for be|ing on a Journey only for Plea&s;ure, we had no Occa&s;ion to fatigue our&s;elves. In a few Hours we arriv'd on the Banks of a very large
<PB N="383" REF="404">
River, call'd <HI>Mernee.</HI> Here we came to a Town inhabited by a People of a different Species of Mankind, and of a Language peculiar to them|&s;elves; tho' they &s;peak the general Language too: Their Cu&s;toms, and Manners differ al&s;o very much; of which being &s;ome Time after better acquainted, I &s;hall give a further Ac|count.</P>
<P><HI>Rer Vove</HI> order'd one of the Hou&s;es of the&s;e <HI>Virzimbers</HI> (which is the Name they are di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by) to be made very clean for him, and all their Furniture to be taken away; and as for us of his Retinue, we might &s;hift as we would. There are very few <HI>Saccalauvors</HI> will lye in the <HI>Virzimbers</HI> Hou&s;es, for fear of an In&s;ect like a <HI>Cow-Tick;</HI> &s;uch a kind of a Creature being often found on Cattle; this they call <HI>Porropongee.</HI> It is found only in the Hou&s;es of the&s;e People, who take Care to breed them, on Purpo&s;e to make their Hou&s;es &s;hunn'd by the <HI>Saccalauvors:</HI> For the <HI>Virzimbers</HI> were, till very lately, under no Go|vernment, and often moving their Habitations; &s;o that when they came fir&s;t to &s;ettle here, the Natives us'd to come into their Hou&s;es, and take away what they thought proper; impo&s;ing very gro&s;ly upon them, till the King, under who&s;e Protection they now are, did on their Complaint redre&s;s the&s;e Grievances. This <HI>Porro|pongee</HI> makes People, who are bit by it, &s;ick for &s;ix Weeks, or two Months together, &s;ticking

clo&s;e on the Skin, or in it for a long Time; but when a Man has been once thus bit, and &s;ick, he is never hurt any more afterwards, if he is among ever &s;o many of them; or at lea&s;t they don't fear them. The&s;e <HI>Virzimbers</HI> are al&s;o ve|ry &s;ubject to the Di&s;temper, call'd <HI>Colah</HI> or <HI>Yaws,</HI> which has been el&s;ewhere de&s;crib'd; but it is &s;o frequent here, that you may &s;ee a third Part of the People of a Town &s;potted like <HI>Lepers,</HI> with dry Scabs. We &s;tay'd but one Night here, and pa&s;s'd over this large River the next Morn|ing in Canoes.</P>
<P>ABOUT half a Day's Journey from hence, lives <HI>Rer Moume,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the King <HI>Trim|monongarevo,</HI> and Uncle to <HI>Rer Vove,</HI> to whom we went now on a Vi&s;it. Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent before for Form-&s;ake, and the An&s;wer being receiv'd, we approach'd the Town, and found him &s;itting in great State under a <HI>Tamarind-Tree</HI> for the Shade-&s;ake; it being the Heat of the Day: He is a very great Prince, and well belov'd. There were then with him twelve Wives, and a great many other People. When <HI>Rer Vove,</HI> with his Wife <HI>Ry Kaley</HI> came to him, they kneel'd, and lick'd his Knee; &s;he retiring among the Women, and he &s;itting down on a Mat near his Uncle; but his Aunts, all of them, except one who was blind, came to him, and lick'd his Shoulder; for they had not &s;een him &s;ince his Return from his Expedition at <HI>Feraing|her.</HI>
<PB N="385" REF="406">
<HI>Toak</HI> was now brought out, and &s;ome given to our principal People, among whom I always was with <HI>Guy,</HI> for he had a particular E&s;teem for me; but my Ma&s;ter being a little proud of his white Man, call'd me in broken <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he having ju&s;t enough to &s;ay, <HI>Come hither;</HI> or, <HI>How do you do?</HI> When <HI>Rer Moume</HI> &s;aw me, &s;ays he, <HI>If it were not for his Hair, and Eyes, I &s;hould &s;carce have known him to be a White; his Skin is &s;o burn'd with the Sun, that it is almo&s;t as &s;warthy as my own:</HI> Ry Anzacker <HI>there, is as white as he.</HI> And, indeed, &s;he was almo&s;t. This was his &s;e|cond Wife, and Si&s;ter to <HI>Deaan Tokeoff$,</HI> King of <HI>Munnongaro,</HI> alias <HI>Ma&s;&s;eelege. Rer Moume</HI> is not black, but of a Copper Colour: He has lo&s;t the U&s;e of his Limbs, tho' without any vi&s;ible Di&s;temper, having no Swelling in his Legs, or Sores, looking very well to Appearance, tho' he can't &s;upport him&s;elf upright. It was &s;up|pos'd to be brought on him by Poy&s;on, given him by one of his Wives with an Intention to kill him, &s;he having been a Captive, and the Wife of a neighbouring Prince, their Enemy, who was kill'd in Battle. He &s;ets on a &s;quare Seat made on Purpo&s;e, and no higher than he can conveniently re&s;t his Legs on the Ground.</P>
<P>WHEN he found I could &s;peak their Language, he was extreamly delighted with me; for he was a Man of a great deal of good Nature, and Hu|manity; which I have ju&s;t Rea&s;on to acknow|ledge;

By his Compa&s;&s;ion I was redeem'd from the Hard&s;hips of Slavery while I remain'd here and at la&s;t by him di&s;mi&s;s'd in a friendly and genteel Manner, and &s;ent Home to <HI>England.</HI> The whole Di&s;cour&s;e now turn'd on me, and my &s;urpri&s;ing Adventures; the Women too join'd in the Conver&s;ation, expre&s;&s;ing their Pity, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;They &s;hould be glad to have me among them, they could never do enough for me, if I would gratify them with Stories of my Tra|vels and Country:&endq;</Q> But this happy Time was not yet come, I was to undergo &s;ome more Slavery fir&s;t, tho' it did not continue long.</P>
<P>MY Ma&s;ter <HI>Rer Vove</HI> was a gallant young Man, addicted to his Plea&s;ures and &s;ome Vices; and indeed, like many young Noblemen in <HI>Europe,</HI> always in Action, full of Fire, and many of the thoughtle&s;s Extravagances of Men of his Age and Con&s;titution, which was very vigorous: His Stature was of the talle&s;t, I dare &s;ay, not le&s;s than &s;ix Foot eight Inches; he might be &s;een in an Army or Croud, at a Di&s;tance, an Head taller than mo&s;t People; exactly propor|tion'd and well-&s;hap'd, his Legs and Arms finely taper'd, without Bigne&s;s of the Joints. I was oblig'd &s;ometimes to &s;erve him in his Gallan|tries, of which a pretty remarkable as well as hazardous One was on this Journey. After he parted from his Uncle, he would go and vi&s;it a Cou&s;in, named <HI>Rer Chemunghoher;</HI> but coming

He order'd mo&s;t of his Attendants to accom|pany his Wife; and me, who expected to have been left her Guardian, to follow him. When we were at a &s;ufficient Di&s;tance from the People, he told me he had a Secret to impart to me of great Importance, and al&s;o de&s;ir'd my A&s;&s;i&s;tance in a certain Affair he was going about. <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> <Q>&startq;He knew my Fidelity, and that I would &s;cruple nothing but killing of People to &s;erve him.

<P><HI>Lewis</HI> receiv'd, and entertain'd me very hand|&s;omely: He was born in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> follow'd the Sea, and being taken by Pyrates was &s;et on Shoar at <HI>Augu&s;tine Bay;</HI> where he liv'd &s;ome Time, till the Troubles of that Country came on; and then he, as well as many Natives, came away for more &s;afe and plentiful Living: So that between the Affairs of <HI>Feraingher</HI> and <HI>Eng|land,</HI> we had Di&s;cour&s;e enough for a long Time; but his Wife going out, I took the Opportunity to ask him, if he could bring me to the Speech of their Lord's Wife? He gue&s;s'd at my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, knowing the Story, tho' I told him no more than was ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for my Purpo&s;e; but he went to her, and &s;he &s;ent Word &s;he would come; which &s;he did &s;oon with only one Maid to attend her.

melancholy <HI>Rer Vove</HI> was ever &s;ince he came near the Town: In &s;hort, I found her as eager as him&s;elf for the Interview; and &s;he appointed that Night, in a Wood at a convenient Di|&s;tance. She return'd Home, &s;ending her Maid with &s;ome <HI>Toak</HI> to me, which <HI>Lewis</HI> and I having drank, I went with the joyful News to my Ma|&s;ter; and it being a Moon-light Night, we came to the Place appointed; tho' going over a River, and thorow a Plantation, the Dogs barking, the Owner had like to have di&s;cover'd us; for they are forc'd to li&s;ten to the Dogs, the wild Hogs often making great Havock in the Night.</P>
<P>I left him in the Wood, and went to <HI>Lewis,</HI> for who&s;e Coming &s;he waited: He conducted her thorow a Breach in the Palli&s;ado; for the Gate was always guarded, and I conducted her to her Lover: Her Maid follow'd with a Ca|pon and Rice, and a Callaba&s;h of <HI>Toak.</HI> They embrac'd each other with great Pa&s;&s;ion, the Maid was for &s;erving up the Supper, but they had other Affairs to talk of fir&s;t; which we perceiving withdrew, and diverted our&s;elves as well as we could. It was two Hours before he whi&s;tled, which was the Signal to come; when we &s;upp'd with them, and then roving about at a Di&s;tance, left them again till it was Day-break. <Q>&startq;Now <HI>Robin,</HI> &s;ays he, we mu&s;t do as the wild Boars do, get at a Di&s;tance from the

As I was looking out, and li&s;tening for the Token, which was whi&s;t|ling, I went toward him, but he being a &s;illy Fellow, and knowing nothing of a white Man, threw down the Meat and Callaba&s;h of <HI>Toak,</HI> and ran away frighted; going home, and telling his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he met with a white Spirit, who ran after him for the Meat, which he was forc'd to leave behind him. This caus'd us Mirth e|nough the next Night, when &s;he came again; a Capon, Rice, and Toak were brought al&s;o this Evening; and I could not forbear being very plea&s;ant with my Ma&s;ter, having now Pa|tience enough to &s;up, and regale him&s;elf with <HI>Toak</HI> fir&s;t. After which they bid us go, and watch at a Di&s;tance, and find &s;ome Diver&s;ion or other to pa&s;s the Night away; and indeed, if we had not made our&s;elves merry, and agree|able to one another as &s;uch an Occa&s;ion requir'd, we &s;hould have been dull People, and have made the Nights very long and tedious. We &s;lept till Day-break, and when I went toward them they were not ri&s;en; then they were to take their Leave, which they did by embracing, and rubbing their No&s;es together, drawing their Breath like People who take Snuff.

So on we went thorow all, but when we were got on the other Side&punc; of the River, we &s;tood to look on one another, and &s;eeing how our Hides were &s;cratch'd and torn, we could not forbear laughing; tho' we were not without a great deal of Smart.

AFTER we were together again we proceeded to the Northward, where all the Cattle is kept. This is the fine&s;t Country that ever I &s;aw, and the mo&s;t plentiful of every Nece&s;&s;ary for the U&s;e of Mankind. The&s;e People never go out to War, but are left to take Care of the King's and Lord's Cattle; and have al&s;o Plenty of their own: The King's Cattle are mark'd with a Mark call'd <HI>Chemerango.</HI> Here are &s;o many Thou&s;ands of them, that it is not known to two or three thou&s;and, how many he has: You may &s;ee Oxen not able to walk for Age, and others for Fatne&s;s; they never trouble them|&s;elves to milk the fourth Part of the Cows, tho' the Place is populous, and as large as &s;ome King's Dominions; which are a great many Towns, many <HI>Virzimbers</HI> dwelling among them. The chief Town is very large, where the prin|cipal Herd keeps a great Court, and has ab&s;o|lute Authority to decide Controver&s;ies, and puni&s;h without Appeal. He made, when we &s;aw him, as great a Figure as a King, and was &s;itting with his People about him in the &s;ame Manner; tho' he aro&s;e to ki&s;s <HI>Rer Vove</HI>'s Knee (not his Feet) out of a particular Re&s;pect to him. He has eight thou&s;and Head of Cattle of his own, and three hundred Slaves; he pre&s;ented my Ma&s;ter with five of his own, and fifteen of the <HI>Chemerango.</HI> He never goes out on Foot, but is carry'd on a Bier on Mens Shoulders; indeed,

<P>BUTTER and <HI>Chee&s;e</HI> might be made here, were there any Body in the Country that under&s;tood it; for the Cows give a great deal of <HI>Milk,</HI> tho' I think not altogether &s;o much as ours in <HI>England;</HI> but then they continue it more Months in a Year, the Summer-time in this hot Coun|try being the Wor&s;t for the Cattle; tho' in this Place here are &s;o many Rivers, Brooks, and Springs that they never have the Drought which we found in <HI>Anterndroea.</HI> Here are al&s;o <HI>Tallow,</HI> and <HI>Hides</HI> enough, if any thought it worth their While to regard them. Many o|ther Commodities are to be found here, which de&s;erve Notice, as <HI>Wax</HI> in &s;uch Plenty that it is thrown away; and there is <HI>Iron</HI> in many Parts of the Country, as well as here, which the Na|tives know very well how to make <HI>Steel</HI> of; al|&s;o <HI>Copper</HI> of their own Production, of which they make <HI>Mannelers:</HI> The&s;e <HI>Metals</HI> I can af|firm they have for Certainty.

<P>I mu&s;t not omit to mention two or three Kinds of Silk, which is in Plenty in every Part of the I&s;land, where I have been; &s;ome of a browni&s;h Colour: But there is one Sort white, the Out-&s;ide of it is full of very &s;mall pointed Prickles, which run into one's Fingers; the Cod, or Bag is about three Inches long, &s;hap'd like a Nine-pin; at the Top, when we take it, is found a Hole, out of which, I have &s;een a blacki&s;h Worm creep: I am not able to de&s;cribe the Worm, nor have I been curious e|nough to know of it's changing it's Form, as the common Silk-worm does; yet this I know, that there are no <HI>Mulberry-Trees;</HI> but the&s;e Worms, and Silk are found on three, or four Sorts of Trees, cleaving, when they &s;pin, to the thick Branches, or Body of the Tree. I have &s;een the People pull the Cod out to a Length on their Knees, with their Hands, teazing it to Pieces, and then &s;pin it with a Spindle made of a Bone, and a Rock-&s;taff; then they weave it as they do Cotton, and it makes verry pretty, and fine Lambers; but there is &s;ome Trouble in the managing of it, which is all the Rea&s;on I can a&s;&s;ign for their not making more U&s;e of it. In this Part of <HI>Saccalauvor,</HI> where the Cattle are kept, is a Tree call'd <HI>Rofeer;</HI> which is of great U&s;e to the lower, or midling Sort of People to

make Lambers of: The Leaf is like a <HI>Coco-Nut-Tree-Leaf,</HI> but longer by two Feet; they take the Outer-part off, and put the other two or three Days to dry, which is then like a long Shaving, thin, and white: Then they moi&s;ten it again, and &s;plit it into Threads, which they knot neatly together, and weave into Cloth: They often dye &s;ome of it, and make their Lam|bers &s;trip'd. This Tree bears a <HI>Plum</HI> almo&s;t like a <HI>Dama&s;ene.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Rer Vove</HI> had &s;een his Cattle, and left about two Hundred behind him, which he got by this Journey, we return'd Home to plant <HI>Rice;</HI> for the greate&s;t Men look after their Plan|tations them&s;elves, and take Care to get Provi|&s;ion for their Families.

<P>THIS Kings Per&s;on I have already de&s;crib'd: I had heard a great deal of his cholerick, and cruel Actions before now: <HI>William Thornberry</HI> let me a little into his Character. I found, up|on taking in the whole Account of him, that Ambition, and Glory was his chief Aim, which he look'd upon to lye in the Pro&s;perity, and Wealth of his Country; for <HI>Saccalauvor</HI> was of very little more Account than other Countries till his Time, or le&s;s Powerful than <HI>Feraingher:</HI> But he having expell'd both his Brothers at his a&s;&s;uming the &s;upreme Authority, One, as I have already related, fled to <HI>Eeraingher,</HI> and obtain'd Part of the Country to the Southward; the Other, with about eight Hundred Men, pa&s;s'd thorow the fine Country, where the Cattle are kept, and where the <HI>Virzimbers</HI> then dwelt, going

on &s;till further to the Northward, and &s;ettl'd on that River, now call'd by the <HI>Europeans, Ma&s;|&s;eelege:</HI> The <HI>Virzimbers</HI> fled from him at fir&s;t, but finding he meant them no Harm, and was only &s;eeking a Place of Safety, they return'd to their Habitations, and liv'd under his In&s;pec|tion. Here he founded a Kingdom, almo&s;t as large, and potent as his Brothers; which his Son, <HI>Deaan Tokeoffu,</HI> now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. <HI>Rer Trim|monnongarevo</HI> finding his Brother had thus hap|pily e&s;tabli&s;h'd him&s;elf, &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors, and concluded a League of Amity with him, he being a Man of a good humane Di&s;po&s;ition, readily came into it; hoping God, and his Father deceas'd, <HI>Deaan Lohefute,</HI> would for|give his Brother; and for the future ble&s;s them both.</P>
<P><HI>Rer Trimmonnongarevo</HI> now courted &s;ome of the <HI>Virzimbers,</HI> giving them Towns on the Banks of <HI>Mernee:</HI> He al&s;o was very Generous among&s;t his own Subjects, making many of them, who had &s;uffer'd Lo&s;&s;es in &s;erving him, Pre&s;ents of Cattle, and Slaves; but more e&s;pecially took all the politick Ways he could, to entice People to come from other Countries to live in <HI>Sacca|lauvor,</HI> pre&s;enting them with Slaves, and Cat|tle.

Relations would come, and live in his Domini|ons: By this Means, they are grown va&s;tly po|pulous, and rich, the People living in Plenty, and Safety; they value, and adore him as a a beneficial Father of his Country. But &s;ee now the Danger of &s;ubmitting without Re&s;triction to the arbitrary Will, and Plea&s;ure of any Man, even tho' he has many u&s;eful, and great Vir|tues, and Qualifications: People thereby be|come Slaves to the MAN, who is not in all Re|&s;pects an <HI>Hero;</HI> but attended with human Frail|ties, and to Pa&s;&s;ions le&s;s governable than in Men of a lower Rank: Superior Greatne&s;s is his View, which explain'd, is advancing his prerogative Power beyond what his Predece&s;&s;ors did; and to &s;hew that he can more ab&s;olutely deter|mine according to his Will, than any of his Cotemporaries: To accompli&s;h this, is the Itch of ambitious Princes, and to enjoy it, and let the World &s;ee it, is the titillating Lu&s;t of the vicious GREAT; and this was the Misfortune of <HI>Saccalauvor,</HI> at lea&s;t that Part of it which was under the immediate civil Juri&s;diction of <HI>Rer Trimmonnongarevo:</HI> For the other Lords, his Sons, and Nephews were as humane as in any other Part of the I&s;land; but &s;o proud was he of the Authority he had u&s;urp'd, to &s;hew that he could act according to his own Will, and was not to be guided by the traditional Laws; that if an Amba&s;&s;ador, or Strangers were at his

He did not di&s;cover this barbarous Di&s;po&s;ition till he was &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;h'd; and then in his Choler &s;everal In&s;tances were &s;een of his Cruelty: And by this Means he lo&s;t many Subjects, who went to live under Others: Some went quite out of the Country, to his Brother's Son <HI>Toakoffu,</HI> tho' they were pretty &s;afe with his own Sons, and Nephews. And this is a Remedy which the&s;e People have again&s;t ar|bitrary Power, they making no religious Scru|ples of their Kings being their Ma&s;ter by divine Authority nor think them&s;elves oblig'd by Ties of Religion, to &s;uffer any Impo&s;itions. The Lords al&s;o have contracted a very humane Habit, of being proud to relieve the Di&s;tre&s;s'd, even tho' there has been Enmity before.

Here was, while I was pre&s;ent, a Woman came complaining to him again&s;t ano|ther, for robbing her Mi&s;tre&s;s, one of his Wives; but in the End, the Accu&s;er was found a vile Creature, and one, who when they ex|amin'd her, had her Ears cut off for a former Theft. Some Emba&s;&s;adors were then pre&s;ent, (and the wicked Wretch had cho&s;en this Time, on Purpo&s;e to accompli&s;h the End of her Malice the more cruelly); for the People expected a bloody Deci&s;ion, and it &s;o happen'd; yet one can &s;carce &s;ay it was unju&s;t, tho' very &s;evere; for after examining with a great deal of Pati|ence, into every minute Circum&s;tance of the Ca&s;e, he order'd the vile Accu&s;er to be led away, and kill'd: The Accu&s;ed de&s;ir'd, &s;he might have the Plea&s;ure of doing it her&s;elf; which he comply'd with, giving her a Sword:

<P><HI>Rer Vove</HI> was now returning home, and my Country-man and I were to part, which we did with great Reluctancy; yet not before giving one another full In&s;tructions where to find our Friends, whoever &s;hould be &s;o happy to arrive in <HI>England</HI> fir&s;t; which prov'd to be his good Fortune.</P>
<P>A FEW Days after we were at Home, the two Amba&s;&s;adors who were at <HI>Moherbo</HI> return|ing to their own Country, and pa&s;&s;ing thorow our Town, <HI>Rer Vove</HI> per&s;uaded them to &s;tay a Night with him, and allotted them an Hou&s;e; to which they &s;ent for me, &s;eating me on their own Mat between them.

Curio&s;ity to enquire after my Country, and Manners; and al&s;o my own Adventures: I gra|tify'd them as well as I was able, or rather as they were capable of under&s;tanding; for they would give but little Credit to the Largene&s;s and Grandeur of our Court, City, Fleets, and Armies, &amp;c. I, in my Turn, ask'd them where their Country lay? <HI>They &s;aid,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;It was a mountainous Inland Place divided into two Kingdoms, called <HI>Amboerlambo;</HI> and govern'd by two Brothers: They had va&s;t large Ears, with bright &s;ilver Plates in them, glittering like Comets. I was curi|ous to know how they came &s;o, and they told me, When they are young a &s;mall Hole is made, and a Piece of Lead put in it at fir&s;t; after the Wound is heal'd, they have a &s;mall Spring-Ring put into it, which dilates it by Degrees, and after this another till the Hole is large enough; then they place in it the&s;e &s;ilver Plates, which are neatly made, and exactly adju&s;ted to the Hole with great Care for fear of breaking it: Some of the&s;e Holes in their Ears are large enough for a Woman's Hand to go thorow. They have Artificers among them&s;elves who make the&s;e Orna|ments. The poorer Sort, <HI>they &s;aid,</HI> who could not afford Silver, had them of <HI>Tuta|neg;</HI> which they call <HI>Ferotchfutey.</HI> They come into this Country to trade with <HI>Iron;</HI> chiefly

of which they make a great deal: They bring Silk al&s;o. Their Air is not healthy, the Val|lies being foggy and mar&s;hy, and not very whol&s;om for Cattle, nor proper to be inhabi|ted; &s;o that they buy Cattle. The Mountains are &s;o &s;tony, that they have &s;carce Earth deep enough for Foundations to their Hou|&s;es. <HI>They al&s;o told me,</HI> That <HI>Rer Trimmonon|garevo</HI> will not &s;ell them any Guns, nor &s;uffer his People. Before Guns were brought by the <HI>Europeans</HI> on the I&s;land, they were too &s;trong for the <HI>Saccalauvers</HI> in <HI>Deaan Lohefutey</HI>'s Time; but this King is too powerful: They have, <HI>they &s;ay,</HI> a Trade &s;ometimes to <HI>Matta|tanna</HI> and <HI>Anteno&s;a;</HI> but not &s;ufficient to fur|ni&s;h them with Arms and Ammunition.

<P>I liv'd pretty well hitherto, and for about three Months longer; when I heard a Ship came to <HI>Yong-Owl</HI> to trade. Her Name (as I have been &s;ince inform'd) was the <HI>Clapham-Gal'y,</HI> Capt. <HI>Wilks,</HI> Commander. Every One who had Slaves to &s;ell, carry'd them down to the Sea|&s;ide: My Ma&s;ter was al&s;o preparing &s;ome. I was over-joy'd at the Thought, but could not tell which Way to move my Reque&s;t. At length I went to my Friend <HI>Guy</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and expo&s;tulating the Ca&s;e with him and his Wife, prevail'd on him to de&s;ire my Ma&s;ter to

&s;end me down, and &s;ell me to the Captain; which he did one Evening when I was ab|&s;ent: And it was well I was, for had it not been for the Interce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome Friends, he would immediately have found me out, and &s;hot me. When I came to him he bid me deliver him my Gun, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;I was a Captive taken in War, and a Slave; and he would make me know it. <HI>Will,</HI> he &s;aid, was an unfortunate Lad left by Accident on Shoar; his Ca&s;e was therefore different. <HI>So calling his Cook,</HI> Here, <HI>Mechorow, &s;ays he,</HI> Take this white Slave, and &s;ee he works under you like other Slaves.&endq;</Q> <HI>Mecho|row</HI> did not fail to obey his Orders, u&s;ing me &s;o much the wor&s;e; becau&s;e I had before &s;ome Command over him.

<HI>I ask'd him,</HI> <Q>&startq;What they &s;aid to it? <HI>He an&s;wer'd,</HI> He &s;uppos'd the white Man to whom he gave it did not like it, for he threw it away; and I am &s;ure it was as good an One as that you gave me; for it's true I dropp'd yours, but I pull'd one of the be&s;t I could find from a Tree.&endq;</Q> My Heart was &s;o full at this Di&s;|appointment, that I turn'd away from him, and went into the Woods to vent my Sorrow by weeping. I &s;oon heard that <HI>Will. Thornbury</HI> was di&s;mi&s;s'd, and was in &s;ome Hopes of his work|ing my Redemption. But in a little time I heard the Ship was &s;ail'd, and not one Word of me mention'd.

<P>SOON after this, I was taken with a Pain and Sorene&s;s in my Bones; which I, at fir&s;t, took for a Cold; but it encreas'd &s;o, that I could not walk without two Sticks: This held for three Months, and then I began to have Blot|ches break out all over my Body; my Neigh|bours &s;oon found it was the <HI>Colah,</HI> or <HI>Yaws,</HI> and <HI>Rer Vove</HI> &s;ent me to a <HI>Virzimber</HI>'s Hou&s;e on the Banks of <HI>Mernee</HI> to be cur'd.

I having now almo&s;t recover'd my Strength, began to think of the Mi&s;ery of returning to my former Slavery; and therefore, after &s;ome De|bate with my&s;elf, I re&s;olv'd to run the Hazard of throwing my&s;elf at <HI>Rer Moume</HI>'s Feet to beg his Protection, let the Con&s;equence be as it would; Death was better than perpetual Sla|very.

Our Bu&s;ine&s;s was Fowling, and Fi&s;hing, in which the <HI>Virzimbers</HI> are very dexterous, ma|king Nets of different Sorts, and al&s;o Fi&s;h-hooks for Angling; which <HI>Rer Moume</HI> took Delight in.

<P>I had now about thirty Head of Cattle, and liv'd very ea&s;y and happy.

The Religion is al&s;o the &s;ame exactly, and their &s;uper&s;titious Regard to unlucky Days and Hours as the <HI>&V;mo&s;&s;ee</HI> tells them; in&s;omuch that many poor Children are privately murder'd, who are born on an <HI>Alhaida,</HI> or on a <HI>Jumor,</HI> which are <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Friday;</HI> for I took good Notice when I came on board the Ship, to remark how the Days an&s;wer'd with ours; and found that <HI>Alhaida</HI> is Sunday, <HI>Alle|tenine</HI> Monday, <HI>Talawter</HI> Tue&s;day, <HI>Alarrerbere</HI> Wedne&s;day, <HI>Comemee&s;hey</HI> Thur&s;day, <HI>Jumor</HI> Fri|day, <HI>Sarbuchee,</HI> Saturday.

<P>I liv'd with <HI>Rer Moume</HI> about two Years and a half, at the End of which Time News was brought, that two Ships were arriv'd at <HI>Yong-Owl,</HI>
<PB N="424" REF="445">
to trade. I was overjoy'd at the News, and hop'd <HI>William Thornbury</HI> would not forget me; but they were there &s;everal Days, and Slaves were &s;ent down to be &s;old, and Guns, and other Goods brought from them. I could not tell how to break my Mind to <HI>Rer Moume,</HI> hoping he would of his own Accord mention &s;omething to me; but one Evening, as I was &s;it|ting with him, came two Men with a Basket of <HI>Palmetto</HI> Leaves &s;ow'd up, and gave it to the Prince: He open'd it, and, finding a Letter, ask'd the Men, <Q>&startq;What they meant by giving him that? <HI>They &s;aid,</HI> The Captain gave it us for your white Man; but we thought pro|per to let you &s;ee it fir&s;t.

<P><PB N="425" REF="446">
<HI>Rer Moume</HI> ob&s;erv'd my Countenance change while I read the Letter, and ask'd me, <Q>&startq;What was the Matter? <HI>I told him,</HI> The Cap|tain wanted to &s;peak with me; and that my Father had &s;ent for me Home, if he would plea&s;e to give me Leave to go. How do you know this? <HI>Says the Prince.</HI> Are you a Conjurer? <HI>Then calling to the Me&s;&s;engers ask'd them,</HI> If they heard any &s;uch Thing. Yes, <HI>&s;aid they,</HI> It is in every One's Mouth at the Sea-&s;ide, that <HI>Robin</HI>'s Father has &s;ent the&s;e two Ships for him; and more than this, the King, your Father, expects him down there, if you give him Leave, and de&s;ires to &s;ee him before he goes to the Ship.&endq;</Q> <HI>Rer Moume</HI> took the Letter, turn'd it about, and up-&s;ide down, &s;ay|ing, he had often heard of the&s;e Ways of con|veying Intelligence, but never &s;aw it before; and could not imagine how it could be done without Conjuration. I &s;hew'd him as well as I could how we learn'd it when Children; the Marks fir&s;t, and then put them together. <Q>&startq;But, <HI>&s;ays he, Robin,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, you don't de&s;ire to go now you live &s;o well here; you have Cat|tle, and a Slave, and may have more if you want them; and as many Wives as you plea&s;e, and be a great Man.&endq;</Q> I de&s;ir'd he would plea&s;e to make my Ca&s;e his own, and think whe|ther he would not de&s;ire to &s;ee his Parents and Native Country, had he been ab&s;ent &s;o long? He told me, he did think he &s;hould; and there|fore
<PB N="426" REF="447">
would con&s;ider of it, con&s;ult with his Wives, and give an An&s;wer in the Morning.</P>
<P>I did not fail to attend him as &s;oon as he was &s;tirring, and &s;eated with his Wives, &s;itting down right before him: After he had look'd on me a good While, <Q><HI>&startq;Robin, &s;ays he,</HI> I have con|&s;ulted with my Wives here; your Mother <HI>Ry Anzacker,</HI> and two, or three more, are for your going; but mo&s;t are again&s;t it: How|ever, let them an&s;wer for them&s;elves, it is out of Love to you, that they would have you continue among&s;t them.&endq;</Q> On which I turn'd toward them, and without waiting to hear them, de&s;ir'd, as they were Mothers, they world imagine if a Child of theirs was in a &s;trange Country, they &s;hould not have a long|ing De&s;ire to &s;ee him, and he them. The Prince then told me, <Q>&startq;If I would &s;tay, he would treat me as he had hitherto done, like his own Son, but he would do me no Inju&s;tice; and if I had a Mind to go he would di&s;mi&s;s me: And this is my Re&s;olution; your Slave you &s;hall take with you, and as to your Cattle, they are yours, di&s;po&s;e of them as you plea&s;e. <HI>I told him,</HI> I did intend to come again to &s;ee him, and if he pleas'd not to take my Cattle, which were in Truth his own, he might let them remain as they were mark'd for mine: And that I de&s;ign'd to make one Voyage here a|gain; in Hopes of making him &s;ome Amends for the great Care he had taken of me; by bringing a Ship to trade with him: (And in
<PB N="427" REF="448">
this I was in earne&s;t, and as good as my Word.) <HI>I ask d him,</HI> If he would plea&s;e to demand any Thing of the Captain for my Liberty. <HI>He an&s;wer'd,</HI> He de&s;ir'd nothing, but if I and my Friends would make him a Pre&s;ent of a Gun, he &s;hould be oblig'd to them, and would call it <HI>Robin,</HI> and keep it in Remembrance of me.&endq;</Q> kneel'd down, and lick'd his Feet with great Sin|cerity, as ju&s;tly thinking I could never expre&s;s Gratitude enough to this generous good Prince. He would not di&s;mi&s;s me this Day, but took Care of the Me&s;&s;engers; and I had as much Re|luctancy in parting with my Wife, and the Women of his Family and him&s;elf, as I had when I went from my natural Parents, and they di&s;cover'd as much tender Affection; but he would not let us go empty, ordering an Ox to be giv'n us for our Sub&s;i&s;tence on the Journey, with two of his own People to accompany the other two; and at length we &s;et forward.</P>
<P>I had yet one &s;u&s;picious Circum&s;tance more to go through, and that was, as we pa&s;s'd by <HI>Mo|herbo,</HI> to call on <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo:</HI> This gave me &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, but when we came near the Town, we heard he was gone to a Place with|in an Hour's Walk of the Sea-&s;ide. When I came before him, he &s;crupl'd not to make an Apology for his unhappy cholerick Con&s;titu|tion; and own'd, <Q>&startq;That he had &s;ometimes done Mi&s;chief in his Pa&s;&s;ion, but hop'd I would ex|cu&s;e him for what had pa&s;s'd, and &s;aid he was
<PB N="428" REF="449">
afraid to let me go till the Ship was near on &s;ailing, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;poil the Trade. <HI>I told him,</HI> That I had nothing to complain of, &s;ince his Son had been &s;o very good to me; and that if him&s;elf would plea&s;e to di&s;mi&s;s me at my Friends Reque&s;t, they would take it kind|ly; but if he detain'd me now they know I am &s;o near, I did not know what might be the Con&s;equence.&endq;</Q> However, he kept me this Night, but in the Morning di&s;mi&s;s'd me with his Ble&s;&s;ing; praying <HI>that God and the Daemons would protect me, and &s;end me &s;afe Home to my Native Country.</HI> So I lick'd his Feet, and took my Leave of him, and of this Cu&s;tom too; for this was the la&s;t Time I lick'd a black Man's Feet.</P>
<P>WHEN I came down to the Sea-&s;ide, the fir&s;t Man who &s;poke to me was <HI>William Pur&s;er;</HI> the &s;ame with whom I was acquainted in <HI>Feraingher:</HI> He came away, as Others did, to live in more Security and Plenty; he was the Interpreter for the Trade. Here were &s;everal Hou&s;es, but &s;uch as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call Huts, built by the Inhabitants, at a little Di&s;tance from the Factory, for the Conveniency of &s;elling Milk, and other Provi&s;i|ons. When I came there, I met Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> the Steward of the <HI>Drake,</HI> Capt. <HI>Macket</HI>'s Ship, and two, or three more of their People; who took me for a wild Man: And in a Letter he wrote, and &s;ent off by a Canoe to the Captain, he &s;aid <HI>The wild</HI> Engli&s;h-man <HI>was come.</HI> I de&s;ir'd <HI>Wil|liam Pur&s;er</HI> to tell them, that I could &s;peak but
<PB N="429" REF="450">
little <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> tho' the few Days I was with <HI>Will. Thornbury</HI> I regain'd &s;ome; yet I was at a great Lo&s;s for Words to &s;peak currently for &s;everal Days. Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> &s;oon came on Shoar, and with him Capt. <HI>Bloom;</HI> for here were two Ships, the <HI>Drake,</HI> and the <HI>Sarah.</HI> I &s;tar'd at them as if I had never &s;een a white Man cloath'd before; and what added to the Wildne&s;s of my Appear|ance, I was naked except the Lamber, my Skin &s;warthy, and full of Freckles, my Hair long, and felted together, &s;o that I really made a fright|ful Appearance to them; but they &s;oon re&s;tor'd me to an <HI>European</HI> Form: Mr. <HI>Hill</HI> cut off my Hair, and order'd me to be &s;hav'd, and cloath'd in a neat Seaman's Habit, light and fit for the hot Country. The Captain ask'd me, <HI>What he mu&s;t give for my Ran&s;om?</HI> I told him, <HI>Nothing was requir'd, only a Gun for a Pre&s;ent, to be kept in Re|membrance of me.</HI> He, therefore, pick'd out a hand&s;ome, and very good Buccaneer Gun, al&s;o &s;ome Powder, and Flints, and a Ca&s;e of Spirits as a Pre&s;ent to <HI>Rer Moume.</HI> He al&s;o pre&s;ented his two Men with Knives and Beads, and the Me&s;&s;engers which went for me had a &s;mall Gun. I pre&s;ented the Captain with my Slave <HI>Anthony,</HI> he then gave me my Father's Letter, which he brought thus directed, and is as follows.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>IN two, or three Days after I went aboard; but the Sea, and Change of Meat and Drink, made me very &s;ick for three or four Days; after which I accompany'd the two Captains to <HI>Rer Trimmo|n$$garevo,</HI> to whom they went in Order to &s;ettle &s;ome Circum&s;tances relating to the trade: This being the general Cu&s;tom all over the I&s;land, the King of each Place makes Terms, and &s;et|tles one univer&s;al Price, to which all the People are oblig'd to conform; and this renders Trading very ea&s;y, and free from Quarrels and Di&s;tur|bances. They pre&s;ented the King with a fine Gun, gilded on the Barrel, and japan'd. I was the Lingui&s;t, and notwith&s;tanding I carry'd on the Corre&s;pondence, my Dre&s;s had &s;o alter'd me in the&s;e few Days Time, that he had no No|tion who I was, till on Inquiry, <HI>Who that</HI> Engli&s;h|man <HI>was, who &s;pake &s;o well their Language?</HI> He was told, <HI>It was</HI> Robin.</P>
<P>A Few Days after this came Me&s;&s;engers from <HI>Rer Moume,</HI> de&s;iring the Captains to come up the River <HI>Mernee;</HI> he having a great many Slaves to fell, and being lame could not take a long Journey, but would come down on the Banks of
<PB N="431" REF="452">
that River, to a Town near enough for the Trade. They agreed that the <HI>Sarah</HI> &s;hould go, &s;o ordering a Long-boat out to &s;ound before them, I went on Board, and we &s;ail'd with an ea&s;y Gale, but could find no convenient Har|bour, or Road in the Mouth of <HI>Mernee;</HI> but three Leagues on this Side, a convenient Place for Anchoring, in a Salt-water River, was found; from whence the two Captains and my|&s;elf went up in the Boat a great Way, till a Ca|noe took us in, and carry'd us to the Town where <HI>Rer Moume</HI> was with his Wives and People. He knew me not at fir&s;t, till I kneel'd, and ki&s;s'd his Knee; and by my Behaviour and Thanks for his great Civility they &s;oon recollected me, and were extremely pleas'd to &s;ee me. Here we remain'd four or five Days, bought all the Slaves they had, and agreed to &s;end the Long|boat once a Week while they &s;taid; and then they went on Board, weigh'd, and return'd to their former Road at <HI>Yong-Owl;</HI> where there ar|riv'd that Day a third Ship, belonging to the &s;ame Owners, call'd <HI>The Mercury,</HI> Capt. <HI>White,</HI> Commander: He had on Board eight or nine Natives of <HI>Dillagoe</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> who liv'd very merrily; they were Freemen, and went with him the whole Voyage; &s;ix of whom liv'd to be brought by him to their Native Country, the next Voyage in which I was with him. Soon after this a Ketch came in, which was fitted out on Purpo&s;e to crui&s;e off the Coa&s;t, and be &s;er|vicable
<PB N="432" REF="453">
in &s;everal Affairs: This was com|manded by Capt. <HI>Henry Macket,</HI> the Captain's Brother; there was another Ship &s;till expected, but &s;he did not come till we were at <HI>Ma&s;&s;alege;</HI> for they agreed now to &s;eparate for the more &s;peedy Di&s;patch of Bu&s;ine&s;s. Capt. <HI>Bloom</HI> had his Choice, which was to go to <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;&s;alege;</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd <HI>Mun|nongaro.</HI> We arriv'd there in a Week's Time, and went &s;everal Leagues up a great River, call'd <HI>Munnonbaugher;</HI> a Fi&s;herman was our Pi|lot, who told us, the King's Town was about a Quarter of a Day's Journey up the Country. The Captain ask'd me, <HI>If I would venture to go there?</HI> I readily told him, <HI>I would, and did not think there was any Hazard;</HI> &s;o going a&s;hoar with the Fi&s;herman I went forward. We had not gone far from the Shoar, when the Fi&s;herman told me the King was gone to War. On which I fell into a great Pa&s;&s;ion asking <HI>Why he impos'd on us?</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>The King's Wives wou'd trade with us.</HI> I told him, <HI>We did not want Provi&s;ion, and as for Slaves it was not in their Power.</HI> But the Man per|&s;uaded me to go to their Town, telling me, <HI>There were four white Men liv'd there, who came from the I&s;land of</HI> St. Mary<HI>'s. Then I &s;uppo&s;e they are Robbers of Ships,</HI> &s;aid I. <HI>No,</HI> he reply'd, <HI>not now; for they have liv'd here &s;ome Years: Their Names are Capt.</HI> Burge&s;s, Zachary, John Pro, <HI>and</HI> Nick. So I walk'd on with my Gun on my Shoulder, with another which the Man carry'd. I had al&s;o
<PB N="433" REF="454">
Knives and Beads, which the Captain gave me to buy Provi&s;ions; I took them, tho' I knew how to live without buying Victuals; yet I thought they would be u&s;eful for Pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>WHEN I arriv'd at the Town, a Man ran be|fore and inform'd the King's Head-Wife, whom I &s;hall call Queen, that a Ship was arriv'd, and one of the white Men was in Town coming to &s;ee her. When I came, a Mat was ready plac'd for me to &s;it down on; I was no &s;ooner &s;eated, than I heard the Queen wi&s;h for one of the white Men to interpret between us, and before I could &s;peak a Man ran out to &s;eek for them; but I &s;oon let her know that I wanted no Interpreter, and de|liver'd my Me&s;&s;age as an Emba&s;&s;ador from the Captain; &s;aying <HI>I was afraid no Trade could be tran&s;acted becau&s;e of the King's Ab&s;ence.</HI> She &s;aid, <HI>That &s;he expected him in a Fortnight, and there were a great many Slaves to be &s;old; and begg'd of me to induce the Captain to &s;tay.</HI> By this Time came in the two white Men abrea&s;t, making a formidable and ho&s;tile Appearance; &s;o I cock'd my Gun, laid the other by me, and plac'd my&s;elf directly before them: One was a <HI>Dutch|man,</HI> named <HI>John Pro,</HI> who &s;poke good Engli&s;h; he was dre&s;s'd in a &s;hort Coat with broad Plate|buttons, and other Things agreeable, but with|out Shoes or Stockings: In his Sa&s;h &s;tuck a Brace of Pi&s;tols, and one in his Hand. The other was dre&s;s'd in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manner, with two Pi&s;tols in his Sa&s;h, and one in his Hand, like his Compa|nion;
<PB N="434" REF="455">
they &s;poke to me in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> with the com|mon Compliment, which I return'd; but <HI>Nick</HI> look'd me earne&s;tly in the Face, and at length took hold of my Hand, &s;aying <HI>Robert Drury, how have you done the&s;e many Years?</HI> In &s;hort&punc; he &s;oon let me know his Name was <HI>Nicholas Dove,</HI> and one of the four Boys who were &s;av'd with me, at the Ma&s;&s;acre of our Ship's Company in <HI>Anterndr$ea;</HI> and the &s;ame of whom no Account could be given in the Conference between <HI>Deaan Crindo</HI> and King <HI>Samuel:</HI> So I went Home with them after I had fini&s;h'd for the pre&s;ent with the Queen, to inform my&s;elf whether it would be worth Capt. <HI>Macket</HI>'s While to &s;tay. <HI>John Pr$</HI> told me, it would certainly be advantagious; that there were a great Number of Slaves, and they wanted the Trade very much; that the King, <HI>Deaan Toke-Offu,</HI> was a very hone&s;t, and good Man, as well as a great Prince, and would return in a &s;hort Time, tho' he did not know whether it would be &s;o &s;oon as the Queen &s;aid: They were gone to fight a King to the North|ward, and went all the Way up the River in Canoes; their whole Army con&s;i&s;ting of five or &s;ix thou&s;and People: Some of the&s;e Canoes being large enough to contain twenty or thirty Men apiece with Accommodations in them, to make Fires, and dre&s;s Victuals; &s;uch I had never &s;een any where el&s;e. The next Morning I wrote a Letter to the Captain, and &s;ent it by the Fi&s;her|man, giving him a full and particular Account
<PB N="435" REF="456">
of every Thing. He return'd an An&s;wer, de|&s;iring me to &s;end &s;ome Men to carry him up the Country to the Town, on their Shoulders in a Hammock affix'd to two Poles.</P>
<P><HI>John Pro</HI> liv'd in a very hand&s;ome Manner, his Hou&s;e was furni&s;h'd with Pewter Di&s;hes, &amp;c. a &s;tanding Bed with Curtains, and other Things of that Nature except Chairs; but a Che&s;t or two &s;erv'd for that U&s;e well enough: He had one Hou&s;e on Purpo&s;e for his Cook-room, and Cook|&s;lave's Lodging, Store-hou&s;e and Summer-hou&s;e; all the&s;e enclos'd in a Palli&s;ade, as the great Mens Hou&s;es are in this Country; For he was rich, had many Cattle and Slaves: <HI>Nich.

<P><HI>Nich.

<P>THE Queen &s;ent me a Calf for a Pre&s;ent, and I gave her Knives and Beads in my own Name: I went to the Shoar, accompany'd by <HI>John Pro,</HI> to welcome the Captain, and attend him to the Town: Mr. <HI>Strahan,</HI> his Surgeon was with him.

<P>WE return'd that Evening to the Ship, and the next Day built a Hou&s;e for to carry on the Trade in: The Natives &s;eeing our Re&s;olution to &s;tay, they built &s;everal others near it, to &s;erve us with <HI>Rice, Milk, Fruits,</HI> and other Nece&s;&s;aries. I went often up to Town to hear News, but it was a Month before the People came back from the Wars; they came down the River in Canoes, having had good Succe&s;s.

Hou&s;e, while I waited on the King; we had &s;ome very familiar Conver&s;ation, he having often heard of me; in the End of which he told me, he de&s;ir'd the Captain's Patience, till he had &s;ent for his People about him, and put him&s;elf in hand&s;ome Order to receive him, and would then &s;end; which in about two Hours Time he did: And then all we white Men, as well Capt. <HI>Bur|ge&s;s,</HI> and the re&s;t, as tho&s;e who came with us, march'd in Order two abrea&s;t, the Trumpeter &s;ounding before the Captain, with a Crowd of black Mob after us; the Shells blowing, and Drums bearing in the King's Pall$&s;ade to compli|ment him. <HI>D$aan Toke-Offu,</HI> who knew how to treat white Men, had order'd two Stools for the Captain and Surgeon to fit on. After the u&s;ual Compliments of <HI>Salamonger umbay</HI> reciprocally had pa&s;s'd, I being Interpreter, we &s;ettl'd the Manner of Trade; and then the Captain made Pre&s;ents of a Gun or two, &amp;c. and the King pre|&s;ented him with a Slave, &amp;c.

The next Day they began to &s;end down Slaves to &s;ell, Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> fitted up <HI>Burge&s;s</HI>'s Sloop, and &s;ent her to fetch the Ketch from <HI>Yong-Owl;</HI> during which Time arriv'd the <HI>Henry,</HI> Capt. <HI>Harvey,</HI> a Ship of five hundred Tuns Burthen: While we remain'd here, <HI>Deaan Toke-Offu</HI>'s Brother was bury'd, and all the Men in the Country &s;hav'd off their Hair; which is the Manner of their Mourning all over the I&s;land.

<P>IT was about the Middle of <HI>October</HI> when we arriv'd here, and the 24th of <HI>November</HI> before the King came Home; but by the Beginning of <HI>January</HI> we had bought more than our Cargo of

Slaves, leaving &s;ome with the <HI>Henry,</HI> who re|main'd after us.

<P>WE did not touch at the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> but at <HI>St. Helena;</HI> where I went a&s;hoar, and took Care of &s;ome of our Slaves who were &s;ick: From thence we went to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> arriving there the 22d of <HI>April,</HI> where we &s;taid a Week, then weigh'd and &s;ail'd to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> where we deli|ver'd our Cargo of Slaves. The Captain not only took a fatherly Care of me on Board, but al&s;o &s;upply'd me with Money at every Place we came to, tho' I &s;carce knew the U&s;e of it; com|mitting &s;everal Mi&s;takes, which were the Subject of Laughter and Merriment: As for Liquors I could reli&s;h none heartily, &s;ince I had lo&s;t <HI>Toak,</HI> which I had been &s;o long us'd to.

The Man of War could not fol|low her, but our Captain, who&s;e Ship was a good Sailer, and mounted &s;ixteen Guns, follow'd him, and exchang'd &s;everal Broad-&s;ides.

<P>A few Days after this, we had the Misfortune to run foul of the <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> Stem for Stem, &s;he tacking unexpectedly, &s;tav'd our Bow to the Waters Edge, and carry'd away our Fore-ma&s;t: The Man of War lo&s;t his Head, and Sprit-&s;ail|yard.

<P>ON the fir&s;t of <HI>April,</HI> 1719, we arriv'd at the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> where we bought &s;uch Pro|vi&s;ions as we wanted, and on the 10th, we &s;ail'd for <HI>Natal;</HI> on the 29th, we &s;aw the Land, in the Latitude of 29 deg. 10 min. South, to the Northward of <HI>Natal,</HI> Di&s;tance about 11 Leagues. We &s;ail'd along Shore, a W S. W. Cour&s;e, with a gentle Breeze; at Noon the Point of <HI>Natal</HI> bore S. W. by W. di&s;tant two Leagues; at two a Clock Afternoon, we came to an Anchor in 14 Fathom Water, within two Miles of the Point of <HI>Natal,</HI> it b$aring W. S. W. the Current &s;ets S. S. W. and N. N. E&punc; Here we traded for Slaves, with large bra&s;s Rings, or rather Collars, and other Things: We bought in a Fortnight's Time, 74 Boys, and Girls: The&s;e are better Slaves for working, than tho&s;e of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> being &s;tronger, al&s;o blacker.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN <HI>White</HI> put on Shoar here &s;ix Natives of <HI>Dillagoe,</HI> which he took with him the former Voyage: They had two or three Kings Domi|nions to go thorow, before they came to their own Country, and were in &s;ome Fear they might be intercepted: The Captain gave them Guns, Ammunition, Hatchets, and bra&s;s Collars. I &s;aw here &s;ome of the <HI>hump'd Cattle,</HI> like tho&s;e on <HI>Madaga&s;car;</HI> but the People have &s;hort woollv Hair, like <HI>Guinea</HI> Negroes, and nothing like <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> People.</P>
<P><PB N="446" REF="467">
ON <HI>June</HI> the 7th, We made the Land on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Madaga&s;car;</HI> I went up to the Ma&s;t|head; where &s;eeing high Land to the South|ward, I concluded we were to the Northward of <HI>Port Dauphine;</HI> the Captain not depending on what I &s;aid, hoi&s;ted out the Boat; and the &s;e|cond Mate, and I went in her toward the Shore, to &s;peak with any of the Natives we might hap|pen on. We row'd along Shore a good While, till I e&s;py'd a little Town, and &s;ome of the Peo|ple looking on us; but the Sea broke &s;o much, three or four hundred Yards from the Shore, that we dur&s;t not venture in the Boat, which oblig'd me to pull off my Cloaths, and &s;wim; two of the Natives ob&s;erving me, &s;wam to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; they walk'd with me to a Point, a Mile farther, where they go off with their Canoes. Here the Boat came in, and I per&s;uaded one of the Fi&s;hermen to go with us. This Place is call'd <HI>Murnumbo,</HI> about ten or eleven Leagues to the Northward of <HI>Port Dauphine:</HI> We per|ceiv'd here a great Current, and Swell again&s;t us. The next Day in the Evening, we came to an Anchor in 14 Fathom Water, not being a|ble to get into the Bay. The Ruins of the Fort bore W. S. W. of us; <HI>Cape Ramus</HI> S. W. by S. the Point of the <HI>Seven Virgins</HI> or <HI>Seven Ham|mocks</HI> bore Ea&s;t: The next Morning we weigh'd, &s;tood into the Bay, and anchor'd in 3 Fathom Water; the <HI>French</HI> Fort bore S.

Cable's Length of the Shore, on either Side al|mo&s;t Land-lock'd: Notwith&s;tanding which, it is always be&s;t to keep a good Anchor and Cable without; here being &s;ometimes a &s;trong N. E. Wind.</P>
<P><HI>Port Dauphine</HI> is in the Lat. of 24. Deg. 50 Min.

S.

<P>I went on Shore immediately to the King's Brother's Town, and told him, <HI>That we came to Trade, but were in ha&s;te to be gone again; therefore he mu&s;t di&s;patch the Slaves down, if they had any to &s;ell.</HI> And this mu&s;t always be principally re|garded to ha&s;ten them, and make them think you are ready to go away; for they have no No|tion of the Expence of the Merchants in paying Men, and keeping them. He immediately &s;ent Me&s;&s;engers to the King, who di&s;patch'd away an <HI>Iri&s;h-man,</HI> who liv'd with him, and had run away from Capt. <HI>Ware:</HI> He told us, <HI>The King would be with us the next Day,</HI> and he accordingly
<PB N="448" REF="469">
came; his Name was <HI>Deaan Morrough&s;evea,</HI> he was dre&s;s'd in a Coat and Breeches, with a Hat on: The fir&s;t Day was &s;pent in Compliments, and making Pre&s;ents. The next Day the Price was &s;ettled, and we built a Factory, and palli&s;a|do'd it round; the King return'd, but we &s;tay'd here till the 19th of <HI>July:</HI> When the Captain &s;ent me up the Country with Pre&s;ents to the King, I &s;tripp'd off my Cloaths, and dre&s;s'd like a Native, with a Lance in my Hand: I think it was not le&s;s than twenty Miles. When I came there, the King was ju&s;t going to Dinner with <HI>Salt-Fi&s;h, Rice,</HI> and <HI>Roa&s;t-Beef:</HI> He de&s;ir'd me to &s;it down, and eat with him, &s;aying, <HI>White Men and he were all one; only he did not love the</HI> French. They kill'd his Grand-father, and carry'd an Uncle away Captive. After Dinner, he treated me with <HI>Toak,</HI> and a Dram of <HI>Brandy,</HI> and then praying to God for the Captain's Succe&s;s, di&s;|mi&s;s'd me with &s;ome Pre&s;ents, de&s;iring we would return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; for he was going to War with <HI>&V;nter' Morrow Cherock</HI> to the North|ward in the Mountains, and hop'd to have more Slaves for us.</P>
<P>WHEN I came on Board, which was the 20th, we weigh'd, leaving behind four Men, and the <HI>Natal</HI> Slaves. We bought here 130, which we took on Board, and &s;ail'd to <HI>Mattatanna</HI> Road; and on the 26th of <HI>July,</HI> we made the <HI>Thrumb-Cap</HI> off <HI>Mattatanna,</HI> and came to an Anchor one League Di&s;tance. Here is no going on Shoar
<PB N="449" REF="470">
in our Boats, for a great Bar, and the Sea al|ways breaking on it; but the Canoes came off, with whom I went on Shoar; and after that, a great Way up the River to the King's Town; One ran before, and told him the Captain's Em|ba&s;&s;ador was coming: So he put him&s;elf in Or|der, and appear'd in great State. He bid me <HI>Welcome,</HI> in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he &s;peaking it very well, al&s;o <HI>French;</HI> and &s;o do likewi&s;e &s;ome others of his Family. Capt. <HI>Macket</HI> had been here before us, and bought 330 Slaves in 20 Days, which made him endeavour to rai&s;e the Price; but I &s;oon let him under&s;tand, that I knew the Country, and that if they had none to &s;ell us, I knew where to go. In the End we agreed, and I &s;ent the Captain a Letter of what I had done; for it is &s;o dangerous going over the Breakers, that I did not care how &s;eldom I went: I did not very well like the Place, for they were em|barra&s;s'd with a Neighbouring Enemy; &s;o that they were ever on their Guard, and could not &s;leep in Safety, nor get Provi&s;ions, the Country being in much the &s;ame Condition, which <HI>F$|raingher</HI> was when I liv'd there. Notwith&s;tand|ing this, the Captain was ob&s;tinate, and &s;ent me a Cargo on Shoar, and a Man to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; &s;ail|ing away to <HI>Don Ma&s;careen,</HI> an I&s;land &s;o call'd, belonging to the <HI>French,</HI> about 100 Leagues to the Ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>WHEN the Ship was gone, I remov'd my Fac|tory up the River to the King's Town, for
<PB N="450" REF="471">
more Safety: I very often lent the Natives &s;ome&punc; Guns and Ammunition to repul&s;e their Enemies, and once went with them. The fir&s;t three Days I bought 14 Slaves, and finding Provi&s;ion dear, I went more cunningly to work; agreeing for the Slaves they offer'd to &s;ell, and leaving &s;omething in their Hands, but would not fini&s;h the Bargain. I had here a knavi&s;h Trick put upon me, which I relate that others may beware of it: One Night in &s;pite of all my Care two Women-&s;laves were mi&s;&s;ing; they were fa&s;ten'd by the Arms toge|ther. I went to the King and complain'd, who pretended he knew nothing of it, and order'd Search to be made for them; but in vain till I publi&s;h'd a Reward of &s;ix Pounds of <HI>Gun-Powder</HI> to whom&s;oever would re&s;tore them; The Man who &s;old them to me brought them again, pre|tending he had di&s;cover'd where they hid them|&s;elves, and demanded the Reward. I charg'd him with K$avery, but not being able then to prove my A&s;&s;ertion, he complain'd to the King, who threaten'd me if I did not give the Man the &s;ix Pounds of Powder. I return'd his Threats in hot Words, offering to defend my &s;elf with my Fire-Arms; &s;ix of which I had ready loaded by me. Before the next Morning, by Threats and Flat|teries, the Women confe&s;s'd their former Ma&s;ter had done it, and mi&s;us'd them when he had them again. I went directly to the King's Brother, tel|ling him, <HI>I would take Care no white Men &s;hould ever come to trade there again.</HI> But in the End he de&s;ir'd
<PB N="451" REF="472">
I would go, and &s;peak to the King fir&s;t; which I did not refu&s;e. He reconcil'd us before our Ship return'd, which was not till about the Middle of <HI>September,</HI> and then without Capt <HI>White;</HI> he be|ing dead and bury'd at <HI>Don Ma&s;careen:</HI> His Bu&s;i|ne&s;s there was to &s;ell &s;ome Slaves to the <HI>French,</HI> and buy more for the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Cargo; but there happen'd to be no Demand for any.</P>
<P>CAPT. <HI>Chri&s;tal,</HI> now Commander, &s;ent one of his Officers to a&s;&s;ure me of the &s;ame civil U&s;age and Friend&s;hip, which I might have expected from his Predece&s;&s;or; he approv'd of my Con|duct, and I perfected the Bargains I had begun, and brought aboard my Slaves.</P>
<P><HI>Mattatanna</HI> is in the Lat. of 22 <HI>d.</HI> 15 <HI>m.</HI> South, a wild Coa&s;t, and no going a&s;hoar at any Time in the Year for our Boats; the&s;e Slaves, and tho&s;e of <HI>Port Dauphine</HI> are accounted the be&s;t in the I&s;land. Before we went from hence I was in|form'd, that <HI>Deaan Morrough&s;evea</HI> of <HI>Port Dau|phine</HI> was kill'd in the Expedition he went on when I left him. Before I give an Account of the Remainder of this Voyage, being now on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the I&s;land, I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omewhat of the principal Places on this Side.</P>
<P>To the Norward of <HI>Mattatanna</HI> about &s;even Leagues is <HI>Malancaro:</HI> Here is a River with eight Foot Water on the <HI>Bar.</HI> This River di|vides the Kingdom of <HI>Mattatanna</HI> from that of <HI>Trounghe,</HI> the People of which la&s;t are very civil and numerous; but cannot trade for Want of
<PB N="452" REF="473">
Canoes. About ten Leagues from the Country of <HI>Trounghe</HI> is <HI>Maninzaroe;</HI> the&s;e would gladly trade with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but having no Canoes, and it being a wild Shoar where we cannot land with our Boats, they are prevented. About twenty Leagues further to the Northward is <HI>Mungaro:</HI> They have continual War with the Inhabitants of Port <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s and the Pyrates; this King's Name is <HI>Maulaunza.</HI> They have no Canoes, and if a Captain would take Canoes with him from <HI>Mattatanna,</HI> they would be glad to trade. <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s is an I&s;land three Leagues off the Main, in Lat. 16 <HI>d.</HI> 30 <HI>m.</HI> having a very good Harbour. Here are about twenty white Men who have been Pyrates, and now live there among the Natives on their ill-gotten Wealth.</P>
<P><HI>Antogeal</HI> is in the Lat. of 16 <HI>d.</HI> 15 <HI>m.</HI> Here is a clear deep Bay, keep the North Shoar on board. At the Bottom of this Bay is a &s;mall I&s;land of two or three Miles round; in which is a good Harbour: The <HI>Dutch</HI> had once a Fort on it. $$ere are <HI>Crampu&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Whales</HI> which the Natives $word$ the Art of taking. <HI>Barimba&s;s</HI> is in Lat. $5 <HI>d.</HI> o <HI>m.</HI> They have Canoes, and will come $$f as &s;oon as they &s;ee a Ship: The King is very civil to white Men, and delights in trading with them.</P>
<P>OUR pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s was to go to <HI>Port Dau|phine,</HI> where we heard a Confirmation of the Death of their King; and &s;ound the Country in Confu&s;ion, and in no Condition for Trading: So
<PB N="453" REF="474">
we took on Board our Men, Slaves and Goods, and proceeded round the Southern-mo&s;t End of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>THE next adjoining Country to <HI>Port Dauphine,</HI> or <HI>Anteno&s;a,</HI> is <HI>Anterndroea;</HI> where the <HI>Degrave</HI> was wreck'd, and which was the Scene of my Sla|very. Joining to this is <HI>Merfaughla,</HI> a little to the Southward, in the Latitude of 26 <HI>d.</HI> South. There is no Trading in either of the&s;e Coun|tries for Want of Canoes. The next Port is <HI>St. Augu&s;tine Bay,</HI> in which is a fre&s;h Water River, with 12 Foot Water in it at Spring Tides; it flows S. S. E, and N. N. W. Seven Leagues to the Northward is <HI>Tulea,</HI> which is a good Har|bour, and well de&s;crib'd in the <HI>Waggoner.</HI></P>
<P>As you &s;ail from <HI>St. Augu&s;tine Bay</HI> to <HI>Yong-Owl,</HI> there are &s;everal &s;mall I&s;lands: The fir&s;t are two in the Lat. of 21 <HI>d.</HI> 0 <HI>m.</HI> four or five Leagues di&s;tant from the main I&s;land: A little further is a &s;ingle I&s;land with high Trees on it; and &s;till further to the Norward you &s;ee three &s;andy I&s;lands, there are Breakers between them. A North-Ea&s;t Cour&s;e carries you clear, and along Shoar; but keep in 15, 16, or 17 Fa|thom Water. On the Banks is 9, 10, or 12 Fa|thom Water. When you are pa&s;t the &s;andy I&s;lands, the Coa&s;t is clear to <HI>Yong-Owl:</HI> This is an Open Road in the Lat. of 20 <HI>d.</HI> 20 <HI>m.</HI> There is good Anchoring in 16 Fathom Water with|in a Mile of the Shoar. On all this Coa&s;t there is no High-land near the Shoar; but you may
<PB N="454" REF="475">
&s;ee Mountains up the Country. <HI>Munnonbaugher</HI> is a River call'd in their Language al&s;o <HI>Manzer|roy;</HI> in which is 14 or 15 Fathom Water: On Spring&punc;Tides it flows Ea&s;t and We&s;t 12 Foot right up and down, you go up the River &s;ix or or &s;even Leagues to the u&s;ual Place where they trade. A little to the Southward of this is ano|ther River, call'd <HI>Luna;</HI> to which the <HI>Arab</HI>'s Ship comes once a Year: This Place is other|wi&s;e call'd <HI>Ma&s;&s;alege,</HI> or the Country of <HI>Munnon|garo,</HI> where <HI>Deaan Take-O&s;&s;u</HI> is King; and of which I have already given an Account.</P>
<P>OUR Bu&s;ine&s;s now was at <HI>Yong Owl,</HI> where we arriv'd on the 16th of <HI>October;</HI> the Captain ac|company'd me up the Country to <HI>Moherbo,</HI> and took our Mu&s;icians with us: I heard as &s;oon as I came on Shoar, that <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI> was dead, and <HI>Rer Moume</HI> had the Dominion, and liv'd at <HI>Moherbo.</HI> I &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger before to let him know, that I was coming to wait on him; and had brought a Ship to trade here ac|cording to my Word. But when we came to a Town ju&s;t on this Side <HI>Moherbo,</HI> we &s;aw a great Number of People pulling down a wooden Hou&s;e, in which <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI> was bury'd; the Rea&s;on whereof, as I learn'd from the Natives, is as follows: <Q>&startq;That <HI>Rer Trimmonongarevo</HI> had appear'd to <HI>Rer Moume</HI> in the Night, and ask'd him <HI>Why he put him above his Father</HI> Lohefutee? And he &s;eem'd to be very angry with his Son for &s;o doing, and order'd his Corps to be ta|ken
<PB N="455" REF="476">
up, and put lower than his Father's; and likewi&s;e his Hou&s;e (built for a Tomb) to be made lower, and not erected above his Fa|ther's.&endq;</Q> Notwith&s;tanding this Notice, when I came to <HI>Rer Moume</HI> he did not know me, I was &s;o alter'd by my Habit; but I &s;oon let him un|der&s;tand who I was, for I could not forbear to lick his Knee: His former mo&s;t generous and humane Behaviour to me made me e&s;teem him as my Father; and he was no le&s;s rejoic'd to &s;ee me: His Wives al&s;o expre&s;s'd their Plea&s;ure. I went to &s;ee my Cattle, for he had kept them for me as he promis'd; and they being now in|creas'd I mark'd the young Ones with my Mark; for he per&s;i&s;ts in it that they &s;hall remain mine.</P>
<P>IN ten Weeks Time we got our whole Com|plement of Slaves here, and &s;ail'd from hence <HI>Jan.</HI> 7. We touch'd at <HI>St. Helena</HI> and at <HI>Barba|does;</HI> from thence to <HI>Rappahanack</HI> River in <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI> where we &s;old our Slaves, took in <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and &s;ail'd for <HI>Enlgand;</HI> we arriv'd in the <HI>Downs</HI> the 11th Day of <HI>September</HI> 1720.</P>
<P>THUS have I endeavour'd to give an Account of what has been in my Power to remark of this I&s;land: I have read the <HI>Atlas Geographicus,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;e it to be a Collection of all that has been wrote of this I&s;land. And notwith&s;tanding I find &s;ome Things there mention'd of which I give no Account, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to depart from any Thing herein contain'd, nor to add any Thing to it; I relate only what I &s;aw, and knew my|&s;elf.
<PB N="456" REF="477">
I have not mention'd the <HI>Scorpion,</HI> which is a very trouble &s;ome In&s;ect; other venemous Crea|tures I never &s;aw, nor knew: As to what is there &s;aid, That the Natives are <HI>Mahometans;</HI> I have read, &s;ince I came to <HI>England,</HI> &s;ome Account of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion, but can find no Re&s;em|blance in it to This of <HI>Madaga&s;car;</HI> on the con|trary, <HI>Mahomet</HI> pretended to talk with God, but the&s;e People will not hear with Patience, that any One ever convers'd with <HI>Deaan &V;nghorray,</HI> the &s;upreme God. But I have omitted to take No|tice of one Cu&s;tom, which is their-<HI>Ab&s;taining from their Women at certain Times as the</HI> Jews <HI>do.</HI> The <HI>Virzimbers,</HI> whom &s;ome think to be the fir&s;t Inhabitants of this I&s;land, I have &s;aid, do differ in Religion; but this is to be under&s;tood in Forms and Manner of Wor&s;hip and Ceremonies; for they have <HI>Owleys</HI> as the Others have, and the &s;ame Notions of a <HI>Supreme God, the Lords of the four Corners of the World, Spirits,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I am every Day to be &s;poken with at <HI>Old Tom</HI>'s Coffee-hou&s;e in <HI>Birchin-Lane;</HI> where I &s;hall be ready to gratify any Gentleman with a further Account of any Thing herein contain'd; to &s;tand the &s;tricte&s;t Examination, or to confirm tho&s;e Things which to &s;ome may &s;eem doubtful.</P>
