<HEAD>THE
ADVENTURES
OF
Peregrine Pickle.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An account of Mr. Gamaliel Pickle. The di&s;po|&s;ition
of his &s;i&s;ter de&s;cribed. He yields to her
&s;ollicitations, and retires to the country.</HEAD>
<P>IN a certain county of England, bounded on
one &s;ide by the &s;ea, and at the di&s;tance of
one hundred miles from the metropolis, lived
Gamaliel Pickle E&s;&abque; the father of that hero
who&s;e adventures we propo&s;e to record. He was
the &s;on of a merchant in London, who (like
Rome) from &s;mall beginnings, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf
to the highe&s;t honours of the city, and acquired
a plentiful fortune, tho', to his infinite regret,
he died before it amounted to a Plum, conjuring
his &s;on, as he re&s;pected the la&s;t injunction of a
<PB N="2" REF="10">
parent, to imitate his indu&s;try and adhere to his
maxims, until he &s;hould have made up the defi|ciency,
which was a &s;um con&s;iderably le&s;s than
fifteen thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>This pathetic remon&s;trance had the de&s;ired ef|fect
upon his repre&s;entative, who &s;pared no pains
to fulfil the reque&s;t of the decea&s;ed; but exerted
all the capacity with which nature had endowed
him, in a &s;eries of efforts, which, however, did
not &s;ucceed; for, by that time he had been fifteen
years in trade, he found him&s;elf five thou&s;and
pounds wor&s;e than he was when he fir&s;t took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his father's effects: a circum&s;tance that
affected him &s;o nearly, as to detach his inclina|tions
from bu&s;ine&s;s, and induce him to retire from
the world, to &s;ome place where he might at lei|&s;ure
deplore his misfortunes, and, by frugality,
&s;ecure him&s;elf from want, and the apprehen&s;ions
of a jail, with which his imagination was ince&s;|&s;antly
haunted. He was often heard to expre&s;s
his fears of coming upon the pari&s;h; and to ble&s;s
God, that, on account of his having been &s;o long
a hou&s;ekeeper, he was intitled to that provi&s;ion.
In &s;hort, his talents were not naturally active,
and there was a &s;ort of incon&s;i&s;tency in his cha|racter;
for, with all the de&s;ire of ama&s;&s;ing which
any citizen could po&s;&s;ibly entertain, he was en|cumbered
by a certain indolence and &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s
that prevailed over every intere&s;ted con&s;ideration,
and even hindered him from profiting by that
&s;inglene&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, and moderation of ap|petites,
which have &s;o frequently conduced to the
acqui&s;ition of immen&s;e fortunes, and which he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a very remarkable degree. Nature,
in all probability, had mixed little or nothing in|flammable
in his compo&s;ition; or, whatever &s;eeds
<PB N="3" REF="11">
of exce&s;s &s;he might have &s;own within him, were
effectually &s;tifled and de&s;troyed by the au&s;terity of
his education.</P>
<P>The &s;allies of his youth, far from being inor|dinate
or criminal, never exceeded the bounds of
that decent jollity which an extraordinary pot,
on extraordinary occa&s;ions, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to
have produced in a club of &s;edate book-keepers,
who&s;e imaginations were neither very warm nor
luxuriant. Little &s;ubject to refined &s;en&s;ations, he
was &s;carce ever di&s;turbed with violent emotions
of any kind. The pa&s;&s;ion of love never inter|rupted
his tranquillity; and if, as Mr. Creech &s;ays
after Horace,</P>
<P>Not to admire is all the art, I know,</P>
<P>To make men happy, and to keep them &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. Pickle was undoubtedly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that inva|luable
&s;ecret; at lea&s;t, he was never known fo
betray the fainte&s;t &s;ymptom of tran&s;port, except
one evening at the club, where he ob&s;erved, with
&s;ome demon&s;trations of vivacity, that he had dined
upon a delicate loin of veal.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this appearance of phlegm,
he could not help feeling his di&s;appointments in
trade; and upon the failure of a certain under|writer,
by which he lo&s;t five hundred pounds, de|clared
his de&s;ign of relinqui&s;hing bu&s;ine&s;s, and re|tiring to the country. In this re&s;olution he was
comforted and encouraged by his only &s;i&s;ter Mrs.
Grizzle, who had managed his family, &s;ince the
death of his father, and was now in the thirtieth
year of her maidenhood, with a fortune of five
thou&s;and pounds, and a large &s;tock of oeconomy
and devotion.</P>
<P>The&s;e qualifications, one would think, might
have been the means of abridging the term of
<PB N="4" REF="12">
her celibacy, as &s;he never expre&s;&s;ed any aver&s;ion
for wedlock; but, it &s;eems, &s;he was too delicate
in her choice, to find a mate to her inclination in
the city: for I cannot &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he remained
&s;o long un&s;ollicited; tho' the charms of her per&s;on
were not altogether enchanting, nor her manner
over and above agreeable. Exclu&s;ive of a very wan
(not to call it a &s;allow) complexion, which per|haps
was the effect of her virginity and mortifica|tion,
&s;he had a ca&s;t in her eyes that was not at all
engaging, and &s;uch an extent of mouth, as no art
or affectation could contract into any proportion|able
dimen&s;ion: then her piety was rather peevi&s;h
than re&s;igned, and did not in the lea&s;t dimini&s;h a
certain &s;tateline&s;s in her demeanour and conver&s;a|tion,
that delighted in communicating the impor|tance
and honour of her family, which, by the bye,
was not to be traced two generations back, by
all the power of heraldry or tradition.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed to have renounced all the ideas &s;he
had acquired before her father &s;erved the office of
&s;heriff; and the aera which regulated the dates of
all her ob&s;ervations, was the mayoralty of her
papa. Nay, &s;o &s;ollicitous was this good lady for
the &s;upport and propagation of the family-name,
that, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing every &s;elfi&s;h motive, &s;he actually
prevailed upon her brother to combat his own
di&s;po&s;ition, and even &s;urmount it &s;o far, as to de|clare
a pa&s;&s;ion for the per&s;on whom he afterwards
wedded, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;equel. Indeed,
&s;he was the &s;pur that in&s;tigated him in all his ex|traordinary
undertakings; and I que&s;tion whe|ther
or not he would have been able to di&s;engage
him&s;elf from that cour&s;e of life in which he had
&s;o long mechanically moved, unle&s;s he had been
rou&s;ed and actuated by her ince&s;&s;ant exhortations.
London, &s;he ob&s;erved, was a receptacle of ini|quity,
<PB N="5" REF="13">
where an hone&s;t un&s;u&s;pecting man was
every day in danger of falling a &s;acrifice to craft;
where innocence was expo&s;ed to continual tempta|tions,
and virtue eternally per&s;ecuted by malice
and &s;lander; where every thing was ruled by ca|price
and corruption, and merit utterly di&s;cou|raged
and de&s;pi&s;ed. This la&s;t imputation &s;he pro|nounced
with &s;uch empha&s;is and chagrin, as plainly
denoted how far &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf an example
of what &s;he advanced; and really, the charge
was ju&s;tified by the con&s;tructions that were put
upon her retreat by her female friends, who, far
from imputing it to the laudable motives that in|duced
her, in&s;inuated, in &s;arca&s;tic commenda|tions,
that &s;he had good rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied
with a place where &s;he had been &s;o long over|looked;
and that it was certainly her wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e
to make her la&s;t effort in the country, where, in
all probability, her talents would be le&s;s eclip&s;ed,
and her fortune more attractive.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, her admonitions, tho' they
were powerful enough to convince, would have
been in&s;ufficient to overcome the languor and <HI>vis
inertiae</HI> of her brother, had &s;he not reinforced her
arguments, by calling in que&s;tion the credit of
two or three merchants, with whom he was em|barked
in trade.</P>
<P>Alarmed at the&s;e hints of intelligence, he ex|erted
him&s;elf effectually; and having withdrawn
his money, which he had laid out in Bank &s;tock
and India bonds, removed to a hou&s;e in the coun|try,
that his father had built near the &s;ea-&s;ide, for
the convenience of carrying on a certain branch
of traffick in which he had been deeply concerned.</P>
<P>Here then Mr. Pickle fixed his habitation for
life, in the &s;ix-and-thirtieth year of his age; and
<PB N="6" REF="14">
tho' the pangs he felt at parting with his intimate
companions, and quitting all his former con|nexions,
were not quite &s;o keen as to produce any
dangerous di&s;order in his con&s;titution, he did not
fail to be extremely di&s;concerted at his fir&s;t en|trance
into a &s;cene of life to which he was totally
a &s;tranger. Not but that he met with abundance
of people in the country, who, in con&s;ideration
of his fortune, courted his acquaintance, and
breathed nothing, but friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality:
yet even the trouble of receiving and returning
the&s;e civilities, was an intolerable fatigue to a man
of his habits and di&s;po&s;ition. He therefore le&s;t
the care of the ceremonial to his &s;i&s;ter, who in|dulged
her&s;elf in all the pride of formality, while
he him&s;elf, having made a di&s;covery of a public
hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, went thither every
evening and enjoyed his pipe and cann; being
very well &s;atisfied with the behaviour of the land|lord,
who&s;e communicative temper was a great
comfort to his own taciturnity; for he &s;hunned all
&s;uperfluity of &s;peech, as much as he avoided any
other unnece&s;&s;ary expence.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is made acquainted with the characters of Com|modore
Trunnion and his adherents; meets with
them by accident, and contracts an intimacy with
that commander.</HEAD>
<P>THIS loquacious publican &s;oon gave him
&s;ketches of all the characters in the county;
and, among others, de&s;cribed that of his next
neighbour Commodore Trunnion, which was al|together
&s;ingular and odd. &startq;The commodore
<PB N="7" REF="15">
and your wor&s;hip (&s;aid he) will in a &s;hort time
be hand and glove; he has a power of money,
and &s;pends like a prince&mdash;that is, in his own way&mdash;
for to be &s;ure he is a little humour&s;ome, as the
&s;aying is, and &s;wears woundily; tho' I'll be
&s;worn he means no more harm than a &s;ucking
babe. Lord help us! it will do your honour's
heart good to hear him tell a &s;tory, as how he lay
along-&s;ide of the French, yard-arm and yard-arm,
board and board, and of heaving grapplings,
and &s;tink-pots, and grapes, and round and double-headed
partridges, crows and carters&mdash;Laud have
mercy upon us! he has been a great warrior in
his time, and lo&s;t an eye and a heel in the &s;er|vice&mdash;
Then, he does not live like any other
Chri&s;tian land-man; but keeps garri&s;on in his
hou&s;e, as if he were in the mid&s;t of his enemies,
and makes his &s;ervants turn out in the night,
watch and watch (as he calls it) all the year
round. His habitation is defended by a ditch,
over which he has laid a draw-bridge, and planted
his court-yard with patereroes continually load|ed
with &s;hot, under the direction of one Mr.
Hatchway, who had one of his legs &s;hot away,
while he acted as lieutenant on board of the com|modore's
&s;hip; and now, being on half-pay, lives
with him as his companion. The lieutenant is
a very brave man, a great joker, and, as the &s;ay|ing
is, hath got the length of his commander's
foot&mdash;Tho' he has another favourite in the hou&s;e
called Tom Pipes, that was his boat&s;wain's mate,
and now keeps the &s;ervants in order. Tom is a
man of few words, but an excellent hand at a
&s;ong concerning the boat&s;wain's whi&s;tle, hu&s;sle|cap
and chuck-farthing&mdash;there is not &s;uch another
pipe in the county&mdash;So that the commodore lives
<PB N="8" REF="16">
very happy in his own manner; tho&s; he be &s;ome|times
thrown into perilous pa&s;&s;ions and quan|daries,
by the application of his poor kin&s;men,
whom he can't abide, becau&s;e as how &s;ome of
them were the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of his going to &s;ea.
Then he &s;weats with agony at the &s;ight of an at|torney;
ju&s;t for all the world, as &s;ome people
have an antipathy at a cat; for it &s;eems he was
once at law, for &s;triking one of his officers, and
ca&s;t in a &s;winging &s;um. He is, moreover, ex|ceedingly
afflicted with goblins that di&s;turb his
re&s;t, and keep &s;uch a racket in his hou&s;e, that
you would think (God ble&s;s us!) all the devils in
hell had broke loo&s;e upon him. It was no longer
ago than la&s;t year about this time, that he was
tormented the live-long night by two mi&s;chievous
&s;pirits that got into his chamber, and played a
thou&s;and pranks about his hammock, (for there
is not one bed within his walls.) Well, Sir, he
rung his bell, called up all his &s;ervants, got lights,
and made a thorough &s;earch; but the devil a
goblin was to be found. He had no &s;ooner turned
in again, and the re&s;t of the family gone to &s;leep,
than the foul fiends began their game anew. The
commodore got up in the dark, drew his cutla&s;s,
and attacked them both &s;o manfully, that, in five
minutes, every thing in the apartment went to
pieces. The lieutenant hearing the noi&s;e, came
to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and Tom Pipes being told what
was the matter, lighted his match, and going
down to the yard, fired all the patereroes, as &s;ig|nals
of di&s;tre&s;s. Well, to be &s;ure, the whole
pari&s;h was in a pucker: &s;ome thought the French
had landed; others imagined the commodore's
hou&s;e was be&s;et by thieves: for my own part, I
called up two dragoons that are quartered upon
<PB N="9" REF="17">
me; and they &s;wore with deadly oaths, it was a
gang of &s;mugglers engaged with a party of their
regiment that lies in the next village; and mount|ing
their hor&s;es like lu&s;ty fellows, rode up into
the country as fa&s;t as their bea&s;ts could carry
them. Ah, Ma&s;ter! the&s;e are hard times, when
an indu&s;trious body cannot earn his bread, without
fear of the gallows. Your wor&s;hip's father (God
re&s;t his &s;oul!) was a good gentleman, and as
well re&s;pected in this pari&s;h, as e'er a he that
walks upon neat's leather. And if your honour
&s;hould want a &s;mall parcel of fine tea, or a few
anchors of right Nantz, I'll be bound you &s;hall
be &s;urni&s;hed to your heart's content. But, as I
was &s;aying, the hubbub continued till morning,
when the par&s;on being &s;ent for, conjured the &s;pi|rits
into the Red Sea; and the hou&s;e has been
pretty quiet ever &s;ince. True it is, Mr. Hatch|way
makes a mock of the whole affair; and told
his commander in this very ble&s;&s;ed &s;pot, that the
two goblins were no other than a couple of jack|daws
which had fallen down the chimney, and
made a flapping with their wings up and down
the apartment. But the commodore, who is
very choleric, and does not like to be jeered, fell
into a main high pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;tormed like a per|fect
hurricane, &s;wearing that he knew a devil
from a jack-daw as well as e'er a man in the
three kingdoms. He owned, indeed, that the
birds were found, but denied that they were the
occa&s;ion of the uproar. For my own part,
Ma&s;ter, I believe much may be &s;aid on both &s;ides
of the que&s;tion; tho&s; to be &s;ure, the devil is al|ways
going about, as the &s;aying is.&endq;</P>
<P>This circum&s;tantial account, extraordinary as
it was, never altered one feature in the counte|nance
<PB N="10" REF="18">
of Mr. Pickle, who having heard it to an
end, took the pipe from his mouth, &s;aying, with a
look of infinite &s;agacity and deliberation, &startq;I do
&s;uppo&s;e he is of the Corni&s;h Trunnions. What
&s;ort of a woman is his &s;pou&s;e?&endq; &startq;Spou&s;e!
cried the other; odd's heart! I don't think he
would marry the queen of Sheba. Lack a day!
Sir, he won't &s;uffer his own maids to lie in the
garri&s;on, but turns them into an out-hou&s;e, every
night, before the watch is &s;et. Ble&s;s your ho|nour's
&s;oul! he is, as it were, a very oddi&s;h kind
of a gentleman. Your wor&s;hip would have &s;een
him before now; for, when he is well, he and
my good ma&s;ter Hatchway come hither every
evening, and drink a couple of canns of rumbo
apiece; but he has been confined to his hou&s;e
this fortnight, by a plaguy fit of the gout, which,
I'll a&s;&s;ure your wor&s;hip, is a good penny out of
my pocket.&endq;</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant, Mr. Pickle's ears were &s;aluted
with &s;uch a &s;trange noi&s;e, as even di&s;compo&s;ed
the mu&s;cles of his face, which gave immediate
indications of alarm. This compo&s;ition of notes
at fir&s;t re&s;embled the crying of quails, and croak|ing
of bull-frogs; but, as it approached nearer,
he could di&s;tingui&s;h articulate &s;ounds pronounced
with great violence, in &s;uch a cadence as one
would expect from a human creature &s;colding
thro' the organs of an a&s;s. It was neither &s;peak|ing
nor braying, but a &s;urpri&s;ing mixture of both,
employed in the utterance of terms ab&s;olutely un|intelligible
to our wondering merchant, who had
ju&s;t opened his mouth to expre&s;s his curio&s;ity,
when the landlord, &s;tarting up at the well known
&s;ound, cried, &startq;Odd's niggers! there is the com|modore
with his company, as &s;ure as I live!&endq;
<PB N="11" REF="19">
and with his apron began to wipe the du&s;t off an
elbow-chair placed at one &s;ide of the fire, and
kept &s;acred for the ea&s;e and convenience of this
infirm commander. While he was thus occu|pied,
a voice &s;till more uncouth than the former,
bawled aloud, &startq;Ho! the hou&s;e, a hoy!&endq; Up|on
which the publican, clapping an hand to each
&s;ide of his head, with his thumbs fixed on his
ears, rebellowed in the &s;ame tone, which he had
learned to imitate, &startq;Hilloah.&endq; The voice
again exclaimed, &startq;Have you got any attorneys
aboard?&endq; and when the landlord replied,
&startq;No, no;&endq; this man of &s;trange expectation
came in, &s;upported by his two dependants, and
di&s;played a figure every way an&s;werable to the
oddity of his character. He was in &s;tature at
lea&s;t &s;ix feet high, tho' he had contracted an ha|bit
of &s;tooping, by living &s;o long on board; his
complexion was tawny, and his a&s;pect rendered
hideous by a large &s;car acro&s;s his no&s;e, and a
patch that covered the place of one eye. Being
&s;eated in his chair, with great formality the land|lord
complimented him upon his being able to
come abroad again; and having, in a whi&s;per,
communicated the name of his fellow-gue&s;t,
whom the commodore already knew by report,
went to prepare, with all imaginable di&s;patch, the
fir&s;t allowance of his favourite liquor, in three
&s;eparate canns, (for each was accommodated with
his own portion apart) while the lieutenant &s;at
down on the blind-&s;ide of his commander; and
Tom Pipes, knowing his di&s;tance, with great
mode&s;ty took his &s;tation in the rear. After a
pau&s;e of &s;ome minutes, the conver&s;ation was be|gun
by this ferocious chief, who fixing his eye
upon the li$utenant with a &s;ternne&s;s of counte|nance
<PB N="12" REF="20">
not to be de&s;cribed, addre&s;&s;ed him in the&s;e
words: &startq;D&mdash;n my eyes! Hatchway, I always
took you to be a better &s;eaman than to over&s;et
our chai&s;e in &s;uch fair weather. Blood ! didn't
I tell you we were running bump a&s;hore, and bid
you set in the lee-brace, and haul upon a wind ?&endq;
&startq;Yes, replied the other with an arch &s;neer, I
do confe&s;s as how you did give &s;uch orders, after
you had run us foul of a po&s;t, &s;o as that the car|riage
lay along, and could not right her&s;elf.&endq; &startq;I
run you foul of a po&s;t! cried the commander;
d&mdash;n my heart! you're a pretty dog, an't you,
to tell me &s;o above board to my face? Did I
take charge of the chai&s;e? Did I &s;tand at the
helm?&endq; No, an&s;wered Hatchway; that I mu&s;t
confe&s;s you did not &s;teer; but how&s;omever, you
cunned all the way, and &s;o, as you could not &s;ee
how the land lay, being blind of your larboard
eye, we were fa&s;t a&s;hore, before you knew any
thing of the matter. Pipes, who &s;tood abaft,
can te&s;tify the truth of what I &s;ay.&endq; &startq;D&mdash;n
my limbs! re&s;umed the commodore, I don't va|lue
what you or Pipes &s;ays, a rope yarn. You're
a couple of mutinous&mdash;I'll &s;ay no more; but,
you shan't run your rig upon me. Damn
ye, I am the man that learnt you, Jack
Hatchway, to &s;plice a rope, and rai&s;e a perpendi|cular.&endq;</P>
<P>The lieutenant, who was perfectly well ac|quainted
with the trim of his captain, did not
chu&s;e to carry on the altercation any farther; but,
taking up his cann, drank to the health of the
&s;tranger, who very courteou&s;ly returned the com|pliment,
without, however, pre&s;uming to join
in the conver&s;ation, which &s;uffered a con&s;iderable
pau&s;e. During this interruption, Mr. Hatch|way's
<PB N="13" REF="21">
way's wit di&s;play'd it&s;elf in &s;everal practical jokes
upon the commodore, with whom, he knew, it
was dangerous to tamper in any other way. Being
without the &s;phere of his vi&s;ion, he &s;ecurely pil|fered
his tobacco, drank his rumbo, made wry faces,
and (to u&s;e the vulgar phra&s;e) cocked his eye at
him, to the no &s;mall entertainment of the &s;pecta|tors,
Mr. Pickle him&s;elf not excepted, who gave
evident tokens of uncommon &s;atisfaction at the
dexterity of this marine pantomime.</P>
<P>Mean while, the captain's choler gradually &s;ub|&s;ided,
and he was plea&s;ed to de&s;ire Hatchway by
the familiar and friendly diminutive of Jack, to
read a news-paper that lay on the table before
him. This ta&s;k was accordingly undertaken by
the lame lieutenant, who, among other para|graphs,
read that which follows, with an eleva|tion
of voice that &s;eemed to progno&s;ticate &s;ome|thing
extraordinary. &startq;We are informed that
admiral Bower will very &s;oon be created a Briti&s;h
peer, for his eminent &s;ervices during the war,
particularly in his late engagement with the French
fleet.&endq; Trunnion was thunder-&s;truck at this
piece of intelligence. The mug dropt from his
hand, and &s;hivered into a thou&s;and pieces; his
eye gli&s;tened like that of a rattle-&s;nake, and &s;ome
minutes elap&s;ed before he could pronounce,
&startq;Ava&s;t! overhaul that article again.&endq; It was
no &s;ooner read the &s;econd time, than &s;miting
the table with his fi&s;t, he &s;tarted up, and with
the mo&s;t violent empha&s;is of rage and indignation,
exclaimed, &startq;D&mdash;n my heart and liver! 'tis a
land lie, d'ye &s;ee; and I will maintain it to be a
lie, from the &s;prit-&s;ail-yard to the mizzen top-&s;ail
haulyards! blood and thunder! Will. Bower a
peer of this realm! a fellow of ye&s;terday, that
<PB N="14" REF="22">
&s;carce knows a ma&s;t from a manger; a &s;notty|no&s;e
boy, whom I my&s;elf have ordered to the
gun, for &s;tealing eggs out of the hen-coops! and
I Haw&s;er Trunnion, who commanded a &s;hip be|fore
he could keep a reckoning, am laid a&s;ide,
d'ye &s;ee, and forgotten! If &s;o be, as this be the
ca&s;e, there is a rotten plank in our con&s;titution,
which ought to be hove down and repaired, damn
my eyes! For my own part, d'ye &s;ee, I was
none of your Guinea-pigs; I did not ri&s;e in the
&s;ervice by parliamenteering intere&s;t, or a hand|&s;ome
bitch of a wife. I was not hoi&s;ted over
the bellies of better men, nor &s;trutted athwart
the quarter-deck in a laced doublet and thingum|bobs
at the wri&s;ts. Damn my limbs! I have been
a hard-working man, and &s;erved all offices on
board from cook's &s;hifter to the command of a
ve&s;&s;el. Here, you Tunley, there's the hand of
a &s;eaman, you dog.&endq; So &s;aying, he laid hold on
the landlord's fi&s;t, and honoured him with &s;uch a
&s;queeze, as compelled him to roar with great vo|ciferation,
to the infinite &s;atisfaction of the com|modore,
who&s;e features were a little unbended,
by this acknowledgment of his vigour; and he
thus proceeded in a le&s;s outrageous &s;train: &startq;They
make a damned noi&s;e about this engagement with
the French: but, agad! it was no more than
a bum-boat battle, in compari&s;on with &s;ome that
I have &s;een. There was old Rook and Jennings,
and another whom I'll be damned before I name,
that knew what fighting was. As for my own
&s;hare, d'ye &s;ee, I am none of tho&s;e that hollow
in their own commendation: but if &s;o be that
I were minded to &s;tand my own trumpeter, &s;ome
of tho&s;e little fellows that hold their heads &s;o
high, would be taken all aback, as the &s;aying is;
<PB N="15" REF="23">
they would be a&s;hamed to &s;hew their colours,
d&mdash;n my eyes! I once lay eight gla&s;&s;es along-&s;ide
of the Floor de Lou&s;e, a French man of war,
tho' her metal was heavier, and her complement
larger by an hundred hands than mine. You,
Jack Hatchway, damn ye, what d'ye grin at?
D'ye think I tell a &s;tory, becau&s;e you never
heard it before?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, look ye, Sir, an&s;wered the lieute|nant,
I'm glad to find you can &s;tand your own
trumpeter, on occa&s;ion; thof I wi&s;h you would
change the tune; for that is the &s;ame you have
been piping every watch, for the&s;e ten months
pa&s;t. Tunley him&s;elf will tell you, he has heard
it five hundred times.&endq; &startq;God forgive you, Mr.
Hatchway, &s;aid the landlord, interrupting him;
as I'm an hone&s;t man, and a hou&s;ekeeper, I ne|ver
heard a &s;yllab of the matter.&endq;</P>
<P>This declaration, tho' not &s;trictly true, was
extremely agreeable to Mr. Trunnion, who, with
an air of triumph, ob&s;erved, &startq;Aha! Jack, I
thought I &s;hould bring you up, with your gibes
and your jokes. But &s;uppo&s;e you had heard it
before, is that any rea&s;on why it &s;houldn't be
told to another per&s;on? There's the &s;tranger,
belike he has heard it five hundred times too;
han't ye, brother?&endq; addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mr.
Pickle; who, replying with a look expre&s;&s;ing
curio&s;ity, &startq;No, never;&endq; he thus went on:
&startq;Well, you &s;eem to be an hone&s;t, quiet &s;ort of
a man; and therefore, you mu&s;t know, as I
&s;aid before, I fell in with a French man of war,
Cape Fini&s;terre bearing about &s;ix leagues on the
weather-bow, and the chace three leagues to
leeward, going before the wind: whereupon I &s;et
my &s;tudding-&s;ails, and coming up with her,
<PB N="16" REF="24">
hoi&s;ted my jack and en&s;ign, and poured in a
whole broad&s;ide, before you could count three
rattlins in the mizzen &s;hrouds; for I always keep
a good look-out, and love to have the fir&s;t fire.&endq;
&startq;That I'll be &s;worn, &s;aid Hatchway; for the
day we made the Triumph, you ordered the men
to fire, when &s;he was hull-to, by the &s;ame to|ken
we below pointed the guns at a flight of gulls;
and I won a cann of punch from the gunner, by
killing the fir&s;t bird.&endq; Exa&s;perated at this &s;ar|ca&s;m,
he replied with great vehemence, &startq;You
lie, lubber! d&mdash;n your bones! what bu&s;ine&s;s
have you to come always athwart my haw&s;e in
this manner? You, Pipes, was upon deck, and
can bear witne&s;s, whether or not I fired too &s;oon&punc;
Speak, you blood of a&mdash;and that upon the
word of a &s;eaman: how did the chace bear of
us, when I gave orders to fire?&endq;</P>
<P>Pipes, who hitherto had &s;at &s;ilent, being thus
called upon to give his evidence, after diver&s;e
&s;trange ge&s;ticulations, opened his mouth like a
ga&s;ping cod, and with a cadence like that of the
ea&s;t wind &s;inging through a cranny, pronounced,
&startq;Half a quarter of a league right upon our lee|beam.&endq;
&startq;Nearer, you porpu&s;s-fac'd &s;wab!
(cried the commodore) nearer by twelve fa|thom:
but, how&s;omever, that's enough to
prove the fal&s;ehood of Hatchway's jaw&mdash;and &s;o,
brother, d'ye &s;ee, (turning to Mr. Pickle) I lay
along-&s;ide of the Floor de Lou&s;e, yard-arm and
yard-arm, plying our great guns and &s;mall arms,
and heaving in &s;tink-pots, powder-bottles, and
hand-grenades, till our &s;hot was all expended,
double-headed, partridge and grape: then we
l$aded with iron crows, marlin &s;pikes, and old
nails, but finding the Frenchman took a great
<PB N="17" REF="25">
deal of drubbing, and that he had &s;hot away all
our rigging, and killed and wounded a great num|ber
of our men, d'ye &s;ee, I re&s;olved to run him
on board upon his quarter, and &s;o ordered our
grapplings to be got ready; but Mon&s;ieur per|ceiving
what we were about, filled his top&s;ails
and &s;heered off, leaving us like a log upon the
water, and our &s;cuppers running with blood.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Pickle and the landlord paid &s;uch extra|ordinary
attention to the rehear&s;al of this exploit,
that Trunnion was encouraged to entertain them
with more &s;tories of the &s;ame nature, after which
he ob&s;erved by way of encomium on the govern|ment,
that all he had gained in the &s;ervice was a
lame foot and the lo&s;s of an eye. The lieutenant,
who could not find in his heart to lo&s;e any oppor|tunity
of being witty at the expence of his com|mander,
gave a loo&s;e to his &s;atirical talent once
more, &s;aying, &startq;I have heard as how you came
by your lame foot, by having your upper-decks
over&s;towed with liquor, whereby you became
crank, and rolled, d'ye &s;ee, in &s;uch a manner,
that by a pitch of the &s;hip, your &s;tarboard heel
was jammed in one of the &s;cuppers; and as for
the matter of your eye, that was knocked out by
your own crew when the Lightning was paid off:
there's poor Pipes, who was beaten into all the
colours of the rainbow for taking your part, and
giving you time to &s;heer off; and I don't find as
how you have rewarded him according as he de|&s;erves.&endq;
As the commodore could not deny the
truth of the&s;e anecdotes, however un&s;ea&s;onably
they were introduced, he affected to receive them
with good humour, as jokes of the lieutenant's
own inventing; and reply'd, &startq;Ay, ay, Jack,
every body knows your tongue is no &s;lander;
<PB N="18" REF="26">
but, how&s;omever, I'll work you to an oil for
this, you dog.&endq; So &s;aying, he lifted up one of his
crutches, intending to lay it gently a cro&s;s Mr.
Hatchway's pate; but, Jack, with great agility,
tilted up his wooden leg, with which he warded
off the blow, to the no &s;mall admiration of Mr.
Pickle, and utter a&s;toni&s;hment of the landlord,
who, by the bye, had expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame amaze|ment,
at the &s;ame feat, at the &s;ame hour, every
night, for three months before. Trunnion then
directing his eye to the boat&s;wain's mate, &startq;You,
Pipes, (&s;aid he) do you go about and tell people
that I did not reward you for &s;tanding by me,
when I was hu&s;sled by tho&s;e rebellious rap&s;callions;
damn you, ha'n't you been rated on the books
ever &s;nce?&endq; Tom, who indeed had no words
to &s;pare, &s;at &s;moaking his pipe with great indiffe|rence,
and never dreamed of paying any regard
to the&s;e interrogations, which being repeated
and reinforced with many oaths, that (however)
produced no effect, the commodore pulled out
his pur&s;e, &s;aying, &startq;Here, you bitch's baby, here's
&s;omething better than a &s;mart ticket; and threw
it at his &s;ilent deliverer, who received and pock|eted
his bounty, without the lea&s;t demon&s;tration
of &s;urprize or &s;atisfaction; while the donor turn|ing
to Mr. Pickle, &startq;You &s;ee brother, (&s;aid he)
I make good the old &s;aying, we &s;ailors get money
like hor&s;es, and &s;pend it like a&s;&s;es; come, Pipes,
let's have the boat&s;wain's whi&s;tle, and be jovial.&endq;
This mu&s;ician accordingly, applied to his mouth
the &s;ilver in&s;trument that hung at a button-hole
of his jacket, by a chain of the &s;ame metal, and
though not quite &s;o ravi&s;hing as the pipe of
Hermes, produced a &s;ound &s;o loud and &s;hrill, that
the &s;tranger (as it were in&s;tinctively) &s;topped
<PB N="19" REF="27">
his ears, to pre&s;erve his organs of hearing from
&s;uch a dangerous inva&s;ion. The prelude being
thus executed, Pipes fixed his eyes upon the egg
of an o&s;trich that depended from the cieling,
and without once moving them from that object,
performed the whole cantata in a tone of voice
that &s;eemed to be the joint i&s;&s;ue of an Iri&s;h bag|pipe,
and a &s;ow-gelder's horn; the commodore,
the lieutenant and landlord joined in the chorus,
repeating this elegant &s;tanza,
<Q><L>Bu&s;tle, bu&s;tle, brave boys!</L>
<L>Let us &s;ing, let us toil,</L>
<L>And drink all the while,</L>
<L>Since labour's the price of our joys.</L></Q></P>
<P>The third line was no &s;ooner pronounced, than
the cann was lifted to every man's mouth with
admirable uniformity; and the next word taken
up at the end of their draught, with a twang
equally expre&s;&s;ive and harmonious. In &s;hort,
the company began to under&s;tand one another;
Mr. Pickle &s;eemed to reli&s;h the entertainment,
and a corre&s;pondence immediately commenced
between him and Trunnion, who &s;hook him by
the hand, drank to further acquaintance, and
even invited him to a me&s;s of pork and pea&s;e in
the garri&s;on. The compliment was returned,
good fellow&s;hip prevailed, and the night was
pretty far advanced, when the merchant's man
arrived with a lanthorn to light his ma&s;ter home;
upon which, the new friends parted, after a mu|tual
promi&s;e of meeting next evening in the &s;ame
place.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mrs. Grizzle exerts her&s;elf in finding a proper
match for her brother; who is accordingly intro|duced
to the young lady whom he marries in due
&s;ea&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>I Have been the more circum&s;tantial in opening
the character of Trunnion, becau&s;e he bears
a con&s;iderable &s;hare in the cour&s;e of the&s;e me|moirs;
but, now it is high time to re&s;ume the
con&s;ideration of Mrs. Grizzle, who, &s;ince her
arrival in the country, had been engro&s;&s;ed by a
double care, namely, that of finding a &s;uitable
match for her brother, and a comfortable yoke|fellow
for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Neither was this aim the re&s;ult of any &s;ini|&s;ter
or frail &s;ugge&s;tion, but the pure dictates of
that laudable ambition, which prompted her to
the pre&s;ervation of the family name. Nay, &s;o
di&s;intere&s;ted was &s;he in this pur&s;uit, that, po&s;t|poning
her neare&s;t concern, or at lea&s;t leaving
her own fate to the &s;ilent operation of her charms,
&s;he laboured with &s;uch indefatigable zeal in behalf
of her brother, that before they had been three
months &s;ettled in the country, the general topick
of conver&s;ation in the neighbourhood, was an in|tended
match between the rich Mr. Pickle and
the fair mi&s;s Appleby, daughter of a gentleman
who lived in the next pari&s;h, and who, though
he had but little fortune to be&s;tow upon his chil|dren,
had to (u&s;e his own phra&s;e) repleni&s;hed
their veins with &s;ome of the be&s;t blood in the
county.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="29">
This young lady, who&s;e character and di&s;po|&s;ition
Mrs. Grizzle had inve&s;tigated to her own
&s;atisfaction, was de&s;tined for the &s;pou&s;e of Mr.
Pickle, and an overture accordingly made to her
father, who being overjoyed at the propo&s;al, gave
his con&s;ent without he&s;itation, and even recom|mended
the immediate execution of the project
with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, as &s;eemed to indicate either
a &s;u&s;picion of Mr. Pickle's con&s;tancy, or a diffi|dence
of his own daughter's complexion, which,
perhaps, he thought too &s;anguine, to keep much
longer cool. The previous point being thus &s;et|tled,
our merchant, at the in&s;tigation of Mrs.
Grizzle, went to vi&s;it his future father-in-law,
and was introduced to the daughter, with whom
he had, that &s;ame afternoon, an opportunity of
being alone. What pa&s;&s;ed in that interview, I
never could learn, though from the character of
the &s;uitor, the reader may ju&s;tly conclude that
&s;he was not much teized with the impertinence
of his addre&s;&s;es. He was not, I believe, the le&s;s
welcome for that rea&s;on; certain it is, &s;he made
no objection to his taciturnity, and when her fa|ther
communicated his re&s;olution, acquie&s;ced
with the mo&s;t pious re&s;ignation. But, Mrs. Griz|zle,
in order to give the lady a more favourable
idea of his intellects than what his conver&s;ation
could po&s;&s;ibly in&s;pire, was re&s;olved to dictate a
letter, which her brother &s;hould tran&s;cribe and
tran&s;mit to his mi&s;tre&s;s, as the produce of his own
under&s;tanding; and had actually compo&s;ed a very
tender billet for this purpo&s;e; yet her intention
was intirely fru&s;trated by the mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of
the lover him&s;elf, who, in con&s;equence of his &s;i&s;|ter's
repeated admonitions, anticipated her &s;cheme,
by writing for him&s;elf, and di&s;patching the letter
<PB N="22" REF="30">
one afternoon, while Mrs. Grizzle was vi&s;iting
at the par&s;on's.</P>
<P>Neither was this &s;tep the effect of his vanity or
precipitation; but having been often a&s;&s;ured by
his &s;i&s;ter, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him
to make a declaration of his love in writing, he
took this opportunity of acting in conformity to
her advice, when his imagination was unengaged
or undi&s;turbed by any other &s;ugge&s;tion, without
&s;u&s;pecting in the lea&s;t, that &s;he intended to &s;ave
him the trouble of exerci&s;ing his own genius.
Left, therefore, as he imagined, to his own in|ventions,
he &s;at down and produced the following
morceau, which was tran&s;mitted to mi&s;s Appleby,
before his &s;i&s;ter and coun&s;ellor had the lea&s;t inti|mation
of the affair.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This laconic epi&s;tle, &s;imple and unadorned as
it was, met with as cordial a reception from the
per&s;on to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, as if it had
been couched in the mo&s;t elegant terms that deli|cacy
of pa&s;&s;ion and cultivated genius could &s;up|ply:
nay, I believe, was the more welcome, on
<PB N="23" REF="31">
account of its mercantile plainne&s;s; becau&s;e
when an advantageous match is in view, a &s;en&s;i|ble
woman often con&s;iders the flowery profe&s;&s;ions
and rapturous exclamations of love, as en&s;naring
ambiguities, or at be&s;t impertinent preliminaries,
that retard the treaty they are de&s;igned to pro|mote:
whereas Mr. Pickle removed all di&s;agree|able
uncertainty, by de&s;cending at once to the mo&s;t
intere&s;ting particular.</P>
<P>She had no &s;ooner, as a dutiful child, commu|nicated
this billet-doux to her father, than he as a
careful parent vi&s;ited Mr. Pickle, and in pre&s;ence of
Mrs. Grizzle, demanded a formal explanation of
his &s;entiments with regard to his daughter Sally.
Mr. Gamaliel, without any ceremony, a&s;&s;ured
him he had a re&s;pect for the young woman, and
with his good leave, would take her for better for
wor&s;e; and Mr. Appleby, after having expre&s;&s;ed
his &s;atisfaction that he had fixed his affections in
his family, and comforted the lover with the a&s;|&s;urance
of his being agreeable to the young lady,
they forthwith proceeded to the articles of the
marriage-&s;ettlement, which being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and
determined, a lawyer was ordered to engro&s;s
them; the wedding cloaths were bought, and in
&s;hort, a day was appointed for the celebration of
their nuptials, to which every body of any fa|&s;hion
in the neighbourhood was invited. Among
the&s;e commodore Trunnion and Mr. Hatchway
were not forgotten, being the &s;ole companions
of the bridegroom, with whom, by this time,
they had contracted a &s;ort of intimacy at their
nocturnal rendezvous.</P>
<P>They had received a previous intimation of
what was on the anvil, from the landlord, before
Mr. Pickle thought proper to declare him&s;elf; in
<PB N="24" REF="32">
con&s;equence of which, the topick of the one eyed
commander's di&s;cour&s;e at their meeting for &s;eve|ral
evenings before, had been the folly and plague
of matrimony; on which he held forth with
great vehemence of abu&s;e, levelled at the fair &s;ex,
whom he repre&s;ented as devils incarnate &s;ent
from hell, to torment mankind; and in particu|lar,
inveighed again&s;t old maids, for whom he
&s;eemed to entertain a &s;ingular aver&s;ion; while
his friend Jack confirmed the truth of all
his allegations, and gratified his own malig|nant
vein at the &s;ame time, by clenching every
&s;entence with a fly joke upon the married &s;tate,
built upon &s;ome allu&s;ion to a &s;hip or &s;ea-faring
life. He compared a woman to a great gun loaded
with fire, brim&s;tone and noi&s;e, which being vio|lently
heated, will bounce and fly, and play the
devil, if you don't take &s;pecial care of her breech|ings.
He &s;aid &s;he was like a hurricane that ne|ver
blows from one quarter, but veers about to
all points of the compa&s;s: he likened her to a
painted galley curiou&s;ly rigged, with a leak in her
hold, which her hu&s;band would never be able to
&s;top. He ob&s;erved that her inclinations were like
the Bay of Bi&s;cay; for why? becau&s;e you may
heave your deep &s;ea lead long enough, without
ever reaching the bottom. That he who comes
to an anchor on a wife, may find him&s;elf moored
in damned foul ground, and after all, can't for
his blood &s;lip his cable; and that for his own part,
thof he might make &s;hort trips for pa&s;time, he
would never embark in woman on the voyage of
life, becau&s;e he was afraid of foundering in the
fir&s;t foul weather.</P>
<P>In all probability, the&s;e in&s;inuations made &s;ome
impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of Mr. Pickle, who was
<PB N="25" REF="33">
not very much inclined to run great ri&s;ks of any
kind; but the injunctions and importunities of
his &s;i&s;ter, who was bent upon the match, over|balanced
the opinion of his &s;ea friends, who
finding him determined to marry, notwith&s;tand|ing
all the hints of caution they had thrown out,
re&s;olved to accept his invitation, and honoured
his nuptials with their pre&s;ence accordingly.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The behaviour of Mrs. Grizzle at the wedding,
with an account of the gue&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>I Hope it will not be thought uncharitable, if I
advance by way of conjecture, that Mrs.
Grizzle, on this grand occa&s;ion, &s;ummoned her
whole exertion, to play off the artillery of her
charms, upon the &s;ingle gentlemen who were in|vited
to the entertainment: &s;ure I am, &s;he di&s;|played
to the be&s;t advantage all the engaging qua|lities
&s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: her affability at dinner was
altogether uncommon, her attention to the gue&s;ts
was &s;uperfluou&s;ly ho&s;pitable, her tongue was &s;heath|ed
with a mo&s;t agreeable and infantine li&s;p, her ad|dre&s;s
was perfectly obliging; and though, con&s;ci|ous
of the extraordinary capacity of her mouth,
&s;he would not venture to hazard a laugh, &s;he
modelled her lips into an enchanting &s;imper,
which played upon her countenance all day long;
nay, &s;he even profited by that defect in her vi&s;ion
we have already ob&s;erved, and &s;ecurely contem|plated
tho&s;e features which were mo&s;t to her like|ing,
while the re&s;t of the company believed her
regards were di&s;po&s;ed in a quite contrary direction.
With what humility of complai&s;ance did &s;he re|ceive
<PB N="26" REF="34">
the compliments of tho&s;e who could not
help prai&s;ing the elegance of the banquet! and
how piou&s;ly did &s;he &s;eize that opportunity of com|memorating
the honours of her fire, by ob&s;erving
that it was no merit in her to under&s;tand &s;ome|thing
of entertainments, as &s;he had occa&s;ion to
pre&s;ide at &s;o many, during the mayoralty of her
papa! Far from di&s;covering the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of
pride and exultation, when the opulence of her
family became the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, &s;he
a&s;&s;umed a &s;everity of countenance; and after
having moralized on the vanity of ri$hes, declared
that tho&s;e who looked upon her as a fortune,
were very much mi&s;taken; for her father had left
her no more than poor five thou&s;and pounds,
which, with what little &s;he had &s;aved of the inte|re&s;t
&s;ince his death, was all &s;he had to depend
upon: indeed, if &s;he had placed her chief felicity
in wealth, &s;he &s;hould not have been &s;o forward
in de&s;troying her own expectations, by advi&s;ing
and promoting the event at which they were now
&s;o happily a&s;&s;embled; but &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould
always have virtue enough to po&s;tpone any inte|re&s;ted
con&s;ideration, when it &s;hould happen to
cla&s;h with the happine&s;s of her friends. Fi|nally,
&s;uch was her mode&s;ty and &s;elf denial, that
&s;he indu&s;triou&s;ly informed tho&s;e whom it might
concern, that &s;he was no le&s;s than three years
older than the bride; though had &s;he added ten
to the reckoning, &s;he would have committed no
mi&s;take in point of computation.</P>
<P>To contribute as much as lay in her power to
the &s;atisfaction of all pre&s;ent, &s;he in the afternoon
regaled them with a tune on the harp&s;ichord, ac|companied
with her voice, which, though not the
mo&s;t melodious in the world, I dare &s;ay, would
<PB N="27" REF="35">
have been equally at their &s;ervice, could &s;he have
vyed with Philomel in &s;ong; and as the la&s;t effort
of her complai&s;ance when dancing was propo&s;ed,
&s;he was prevailed upon, at the reque&s;t of her new
&s;i&s;ter, to open the ball in per&s;on.</P>
<P>In a word, Mrs. Grizzle was the principal figure
in this fe&s;tival, and almo&s;t eclip&s;ed the bride, who
far from &s;eeming to di&s;pute the preheminence,
very wi&s;ely allowed her to make the be&s;t of her
talents; contenting her&s;elf with the lot to which
fortune had already called her, and which &s;he
imagined would not be the le&s;s de&s;irable, if her
&s;i&s;ter-in-law were detached from the family.</P>
<P>I believe I need &s;carce adverti&s;e the reader,
that during this whole entertainment, the com|modore
and his lieutenant were quite out of their
element; and this indeed, was the ca&s;e with the
bridegroom him&s;elf, who being utterly unac|quainted
with any &s;ort of polite commerce, found
him&s;elf under a very di&s;agreeable re&s;traint during
the whole &s;cene.</P>
<P>Trunnion, who had &s;carce ever been on &s;hore
till he was paid off, and never once in his whole
life, in the company of any females above the
rank of tho&s;e who herd upon the point at Port&s;|mouth,
was more embarra&s;&s;ed about his beha|viour
than if he had been &s;urrounded at &s;ea by
the whole French navy. He had never pro|nounced
the word <HI>Madam</HI> &s;ince he was born, &s;o
that far from entering into conver&s;ation with the
ladies, he would not even return the compliment,
or give the lea&s;t nod of civility when they drank
to his health; and I verily believe, would rather
have &s;uffered &s;uffocation, than allowed the &s;imple
phra&s;e, <HI>your &s;ervant</HI>, to proceed from his mouth.
He was altogether as inflexible with re&s;pect to the
<PB N="28" REF="36">
attitudes of his body; for, either through ob&s;ti|nacy
or ba&s;hfulne&s;s, he &s;at upright without mo|tion,
in&s;omuch that he provoked the mirth of a
certain wag, who addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the lieu|tenant,
a&s;ked whether that was the commodore
him&s;elf, or the wooden lion that u&s;ed to &s;tand at
his gate? An image to which, it mu&s;t be owned,
Mr. Trunnion's per&s;on bore no faint re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>Mr. Hatchway, who was not quite &s;o unpo|li&s;hed
as the commodore, and had certain notions
that &s;eemed to approach the ideas of common life,
made a le&s;s uncouth appearance; but then he was
a wit, and though of a very peculiar genius, par|took
largely of that di&s;po&s;ition which is common
to all wits, who never enjoy them&s;elves, except
when their talents meet with tho&s;e marks of di|&s;tinction
and veneration, which (in their own
opinion) they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances being premi&s;ed, it is
not to be wondered at, if this triumvirate made
no objections to the propo&s;al, when &s;ome of
the grave per&s;onages of the company made a
motion for adjourning into another apartment,
where they might enjoy their pipes and bottles,
while the young folks indulged them&s;elves in the
continuance of their own favourite diver&s;ion. Thus
re&s;cued, as it were, from a &s;tate of annihilation, the
fir&s;t u&s;e the two lads of the ca&s;tle made of their ex|i&s;tence,
was to ply the bridegroom &s;o hard with
bumpers, that in le&s;s than an hour he made divers
efforts to &s;ing, and &s;oon after was carried to bed, de|prived
of all manner of &s;en&s;ation, to the utter di&s;|appointment
of the bridemen and maids, who, by
this accident, were prevented from throwing the
&s;tocking, and performing certain other ceremo|nies
<PB N="29" REF="37">
practi&s;ed on &s;uch occa&s;ions. As for the bride,
&s;he bore this misfortune with great good humour,
and indeed, on all occa&s;ions, behaved like a di&s;|creet
woman, perfectly well acquainted with the
nature of her own &s;ituation.</P>

<P>WHatever deference, not to &s;ay &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,

to manage the reins of government in the

&s;he performed with great capacity, and in

told her one day &s;he would take that trouble upon

&s;trange di&s;tortion of look, &s;he replied, &startq;I &s;hall

had recour&s;e again to the company of his &s;ea|friends,
with whom he &s;pent the be&s;t part of his
time. But, if he was &s;atisfied with his condition,
the ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e with Mrs. Grizzle, who
finding her importance in the family greatly di|mini&s;hed,
her attractions neglected by all the
male-&s;ex in the neighbourhood, and the withering
hand of time hang threatning over her head, be|gan
to feel the horror of eternal virginity, and in
a &s;ort of de&s;peration, re&s;olved at any rate to
re&s;cue her&s;elf from that reproachful and uncom|fortable
&s;ituation. Thus determined, &s;he formed
a plan, the execution of which, to a &s;pirit le&s;s
enterprizing and &s;ufficient than her's, would have
appeared altogether impracticable; this was no
other than to make a conque&s;t of the commo|dore's
heart, which the reader will ea&s;ily believe
was not very &s;u&s;ceptible of tender impre&s;&s;ions;
but, on the contrary, fortified with in&s;en&s;ibility
and prejudice again&s;t the charms of the whole
&s;ex, and particularly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to the prejudice
of that cla&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of
old maids, in which Mrs. Grizzle was, by this
time, unhappily ranked. She neverthele&s;s took
the field, and having inve&s;ted this &s;eemingly im|pregnable
fortre&s;s, began to break ground one
day, when Trunnion dined at her brother's, by
&s;pringing certain en&s;naring commendations on
the hone&s;ty and &s;incerity of &s;ea-&s;aring people,
paying a particular attention to his plate, and af|fecting
a &s;imper of approbation at every thing he
&s;aid which by any means &s;he could con&s;true into
a joke, or with mode&s;ty be &s;uppo&s;ed to hear:
<PB N="32" REF="40">
nay, even when he left decency on the left hand,
(which was often the ca&s;e) &s;he ventured to repri|mand
his freedom of &s;peech with a gracious
grin, &s;aying, &startq;Sure you gentlemen belong|ing
to the &s;ea have &s;uch an odd way with you.&endq;
But, all this complacency was &s;o ineffectual, that,
far from &s;u&s;pecting the true cau&s;e of it, the com|modore,
that very evening, at the club, in pre|&s;ence
of her brother, with whom, by this time,
he could take any manner of freedom, did not
&s;cruple to damn her for a &s;quinting, block-faced,
chattering pi&s;s-ki$chen; and immediately after
drank de&s;pair to all old maids; a toa&s;t which
Mr. Pickle pledged without the lea&s;t he&s;itation,
and next day intimated to his &s;i&s;ter, who bore
the indignity with &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;ignation, and did
not therefore de&s;i&s;t from her &s;cheme, unpromi&s;ing
as it &s;eemed to be, until her attention was called
off, and engaged in another care, which, for
&s;ome time, interrupted the progre&s;s of this de|&s;ign.
Her &s;i&s;ter had not been married many
months, when &s;he exhibited evident &s;ymptoms
of pregnancy, to the general &s;atisfaction of all
concerned, and the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of Mrs.
Grizzle, who (as we have already hinted) was
more intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ervation of the family|name,
than in any other con&s;ideration what|ever.
She therefore no &s;ooner di&s;covered appear|ances
to ju&s;tify and confirm her hopes, than po&s;t|poning
her own purpo&s;e, and laying a&s;ide that
pique and re&s;entment &s;he had conceived from the
behaviour of Mrs. Pickle, when &s;he &s;uper&s;eded
her authority; or perhaps, con&s;idering her in no
other light than that of the vehicle which con|tained,
and was de&s;tined to convey her brother's
heir to light, &s;he determined to exert her utter|mo&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="41">
in nur&s;ing, tending, and cheri&s;hing her,
during the term of her important charge. With
this view &s;he purcha&s;ed Culpepper's midwifery,
which, with that &s;agacious performance dignified
with Ari&s;totle's name, &s;he &s;tudied with indefati|gable
care, and diligently peru&s;ed the Compleat
Hou&s;e-wife, together with Quincy's di&s;pen&s;atory,
culling every jelly, marmalade and con&s;erve
which the&s;e authors recommend as either &s;alutary
or tooth&s;ome, for the benefit and comfort of her
&s;i&s;ter-in-law, during her ge&s;tation. She re&s;tricted
her from eating roots, pot-herbs, fruit, and all
&s;ort of vegetables; and one day when Mrs. Pickle
had plucked a peach with her own hand, and
was in the very act of putting it between her
teeth, Mrs. Grizzle perceived the ra&s;h attempt,
and running up to her, fell upon her knees in
the garden, intreating her, with tears in her
eyes, to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a pernicious appetite. Her
reque&s;t was no &s;ooner complied with, than recol|lecting
that if her &s;i&s;ter's longing was baulked,
the child might be affected with &s;ome di&s;agreeable
mark, or deplorable di&s;ea&s;e, &s;he begged as ear|ne&s;tly
that &s;he would &s;wallow the fruit, and in
the mean time ran for &s;ome cordial water of her
own compo&s;ing, which &s;he forced upon her &s;i&s;ter,
as an antidote to the poi&s;on &s;he had received.</P>
<P>This exce&s;&s;ive zeal and tenderne&s;s did not fail
to be very trouble&s;ome to Mrs. Pickle, who
having revolved divers plans for the recovery of
her own ea&s;e, at length determined to engage
Mrs. Grizzle in &s;uch employment as would inter|rupt
that clo&s;e attendance which &s;he &s;ound &s;o
teizing and di&s;agreeable. Neither did &s;he wait
long for an opportunity of putting her re&s;olution
in practice. The very next day, a gentleman
<PB N="34" REF="42">
happening to dine with Mr. Pickle, unfortu|nately
mentioned a pine-apple, part of which he
had eaten a week before at the hou&s;e of a noble|man
who lived in another part of the country,
at the di&s;tance of an hundred miles at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>The name of this fatal fruit was no &s;ooner
pronounced, than Mrs. Grizzle, who ince&s;&s;antly
watched her &s;i&s;ter's looks, took the alarm, be|cau&s;e
&s;he thought they gave certain indications
of curio&s;ity and de&s;ire; and after having ob&s;erved
that &s;he her&s;elf never could eat pine-apples,
which were altogether unnatural productions, ex|torted
by the force of artificial fire, out of filthy
manure, a&s;ked with a faultering voice, if Mrs.
Pickle was not of her way of thinking? This
young lady, who wanted neither &s;lyne&s;s nor pe|netration,
at once divined her meaning, and re|plied
with &s;eeming unconcern, that for her own
part &s;he &s;hould never repine, if there was not a
pine-apple in the univer&s;e, provided &s;he could
indulge her&s;elf with the fruits of her own coun|try.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer, which was calculated for the be|nefit
of the &s;tranger, who would certainly have
&s;uffered for his impr$dence by the re&s;entment of
Mrs. Grizzle, had her &s;i&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t
reli&s;h for the fruit in que&s;tion: I &s;ay, this an|&s;wer
had the de&s;ired effect, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the
peace of the company, which was not a little
endangered by the gentleman's want of con&s;idera|tion.
Next morning, however, after breakfa&s;t,
the pregnant lady, in pur&s;uance of her plan,
yawned (as it were by accident) full in the face
of her maiden &s;i&s;ter, who being infinitely di|&s;turbed
by this convul&s;ion, affirmed it was a &s;ymp|tom
of longing; and in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing the
<PB N="35" REF="43">
object in de&s;ire, when Mrs. Pickle affecting an
affected &s;mile, told her &s;he had eaten a mo&s;t de|licious
pine-apple in her &s;leep. This declara|tion
was attended with an immediate &s;cream ut|tered
by Mrs. Grizzle, who in&s;tantly perceiving
her &s;i&s;ter &s;urprized at the exclamation, cla&s;ped
her in her arms, and a&s;&s;ured her, with a &s;ort of
hy&s;terical laugh, importing horror rather than de|light,
that &s;he could not help &s;creaming with joy,
becau&s;e &s;he had it in her power to gratify her
dear &s;i&s;ter's wi&s;h; a lady in the neighbourhood
having promi&s;ed to &s;end her, in a pre&s;ent, a cou|ple
of fine pine-apples, which &s;he would that very
day go in que&s;t of.</P>
<P>Mrs. Pickle would by no means con&s;ent to
this propo&s;al, on pretence of &s;paring the other
unnece&s;&s;ary fatigue; and a&s;&s;ured her, that, if &s;he
had any de&s;ire to eat a pine-apple, it was &s;o faint,
that the di&s;appointment could produce no bad
con&s;equence. But this a&s;&s;urance was conveyed
in a manner (which &s;he knew very well how to
adopt) that in&s;tead of di&s;&s;uading, rather &s;timu|lated
Mrs. Grizzle to &s;et out immediately, not
on a vi&s;it to that lady, who&s;e promi&s;e &s;he her&s;elf
had &s;eigned with a view of con&s;ulting her &s;i&s;ter's
tranquillity, but on a random &s;earch thro' the
whole county for this unlucky fruit, which was
like to produce &s;o much vexation and prejudice to
her and her father's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>During $hree whole days and nights, did &s;he,
attended by a valet, ride from place to place
without &s;ucce&s;s, unmindful of her health, and
carele&s;s of her reputation, that began to &s;uffer
from the nature of her inquiry, which was pur|&s;ued
with &s;uch peculiar eagerne&s;s and di&s;traction&punc;
that every body with whom &s;he conver&s;ed, looked
<PB N="36" REF="44">
upon her as an unhappy per&s;on, who&s;e intellects
were not a little di&s;ordered.</P>
<P>Baffled in all her re&s;earches within the county,
&s;he at length re&s;olved to vi&s;it that very nobleman,
at who&s;e hou&s;e the officious &s;tranger had been
(for her) &s;o unfortunately regaled, and actually
arrived in a po&s;t-chai&s;e at the place of his habi|tation,
where &s;he introduced her bu&s;ine&s;s as an af|fair
on which the happine&s;s of a whole family
depended. But, alas! &s;he had come too late;
his lord&s;hip lamented, in very polite and pathetic
terms, that he was di&s;abled from exerting his hu|manity,
and enjoying the plea&s;ure he &s;hould feel
in contributing to the happine&s;s of his fellow|creatures,
at &s;uch an ea&s;y rate; telling her, that
he had unluckily, the very day before, &s;ent the
two la&s;t pine-apples his garden had produced, in
a pre&s;ent to a certain lady in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Mrs. Grizzle was &s;o affected with this explana|tion,
that &s;he fainted away, and was immediately
carried to the public hou&s;e, where &s;he had left
her hor&s;es, and where &s;he remained incon&s;olable
for the di&s;appointment, which in all likelihood
would have proved more fatal to her than to the
per&s;on for whom &s;he was &s;o piou&s;ly concerned,
had not &s;he in the evening, by the medium of
her own &s;ervant, received a hint from the no|bleman's
gardener, that for five pieces &s;he &s;hould
be furni&s;hed with a couple of as fine apples as
ever were &s;een in England. The terms (I &s;carce
need &s;ay) were greedily embraced, the fruit &s;e|cured
in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and &s;he departed that
very night on her return to her brother's hou&s;e,
where &s;he &s;afely arrived with her acqui&s;ition, and
was mo&s;t cordially received by her &s;i&s;ter, who
had been under &s;ome apprehen&s;ions on her ac|count.
<PB N="37" REF="45">
Neither was his lord&s;hip forgotten in
Mrs. Grizzle's benediction, when &s;he under&s;tood
from the valet who accompanied her, that he
had, with his own eyes, &s;een above an hundred
pine-apples ripe for cutting in his garden the
evening of that very day on which he had a&s;|&s;ured
her that there was not one left.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mrs. Grizzle is indefatigable in gratifying her
&s;i&s;ter's longings. Peregrine is born, and ma|naged
contrary to the directions and remon&s;trances
of his aunt, who is di&s;gu&s;ted upon that account;
and re&s;umes the plan which &s;he had before re|jected.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of this device would have en|couraged
Mrs. Pickle to practi&s;e more of
the &s;ame &s;ort upon her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, had &s;he not
been deterred by a violent fever which &s;eized her
zealous ally, in con&s;equence of the fatigue and
unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he had undergone; which, while it
la&s;ted, as effectually conduced to her repo&s;e, as
any other &s;tratagem &s;he could invent. But Mrs.
Grizzle's health was no &s;ooner re&s;tored, than the
other being as much incommoded as ever, was
obliged, in her own defence, to have recour&s;e to
&s;ome other contrivance; and managed her artifi|ces
in &s;uch a manner, as leaves it at this day a
doubt whether &s;he was really &s;o whim&s;ical and
capricious in her appetites as &s;he her&s;elf pretended
to be; for her longings were not re&s;tricted to the
demands of the palate and &s;tomach, but al&s;o af|fected
all the other organs of &s;en&s;e, and even in|vaded
<PB N="38" REF="46">
her imagination, which at this period
&s;eemed to be &s;trangely di&s;ea&s;ed.</P>
<P>One time &s;he longed to pinch her hu&s;band's
ear; and it was with infinite difficulty that his &s;i&s;|ter
could prevail upon him to undergo the ope|ration.
Yet this ta&s;k was ea&s;y, in compari&s;on
with another &s;he undertook for the gratification
of Mrs. Pickle's unaccountable de&s;ire; which was
no other than to per&s;uade the commodore to &s;ub|mit
his chin to the mercy of the big-bellied lady,
who ardently wi&s;hed for an opportunity of pluck|ing
three black hairs from his beard. When this
propo&s;al was fir&s;t communicated to Mr. Trun|nion
by the hu&s;band, his an&s;wer was nothing but
a dreadful effu&s;ion of oaths, accompanied with
&s;uch a &s;tare, and delivered in &s;uch a tone of voice,
as terrified the poor be&s;eecher into immediate
&s;ilence; &s;o that Mrs. Grizzle was fain to take the
whole enterprize upon her&s;elf, and next day went
to the garri&s;on accordingly, where having obtained
entrance by means of the lieutenant, who, while
his commander was a&s;leep, ordered her to be ad|mitted
for the joke's &s;ake, &s;he waited patiently
till he turned out, and then acco&s;ted him in the
yard, where he u&s;ed to perform his morning
walk. He was thunder-&s;truck at the appearance
of a woman in a place which he had hitherto
kept &s;acred from the whole &s;ex, and immediately
began to utter an apo&s;trophe to Tom Pipes, who&s;e
turn it was then to watch; when Mrs. Grizzle
falling on her knees before him, conjured him
with many pathetic &s;upplications, to hear and
grant her reque&s;t, which was no &s;ooner &s;ignified,
than he bellowed in &s;uch an outragious manner,
that the whole court re-ecchoed the opprobrious
term <HI>bitch</HI>; and the word <HI>damnation</HI> which he
<PB N="39" REF="47">
repeated with &s;urpri&s;ing volubility, without any
&s;ort of propriety or connection; and retreated
into his penetralia, leaving the baffled devotee in
the humble po&s;ture &s;he had &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sfully
cho&s;en to melt his obdurate heart.</P>
<P>Mortifying as this repul&s;e mu&s;t have been to a
lady of her &s;tately di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he did not relinqui&s;h
her aim, but endeavoured to intere&s;t the commo|dore's
coun&s;ellors and adherents in her cau&s;e. With
this view &s;he &s;ollicited the intere&s;t of Mr. Hatch|way,
who being highly plea&s;ed with a circum|&s;tance
in all probability &s;o productive of mirth
and diver&s;ion, readily entered into her mea&s;ures,
and promi&s;ed to employ his whole influence for
her &s;atisfaction: and as for the boat&s;wain's mate,
he was rendered propitious by the pre&s;ent of a
guinea which &s;he &s;lipt into his hand. In &s;hort,
Mrs. Grizz'e was continually engaged in this
negotiation for the &s;pace of ten days, during
which the commodore was &s;o ince&s;&s;antly pe&s;|tered
with her remon&s;trances, and the admoni|tions
of his a&s;&s;ociates, that he &s;wore his people
had a de&s;ign upon his life, which becoming a
burthen to him, he at la&s;t complied, and was
conducted to the &s;cene like a victim to the altar,
by the exulting prie&s;ts; or rather growling like
a reluctant bear, when he is led to the &s;take
amid&s;t the &s;houts and cries of butchers and their
dogs. After all, this victory was not quite &s;o de|ci&s;ive
as the conquerors imagined; for the patient
being &s;et, and the performer prepared with a pair
of pincers, a &s;mall difficulty occurred: &s;he could
not for &s;ome time di&s;cern one black hair on the
whole &s;uperficies of Mr. Trunnion's face; when
Mrs. Grizzle, very much alarmed and di&s;con|certed,
had recour&s;e to a magnifying gla&s;s that
<PB N="40" REF="48">
&s;tood upon her toilette; and after a mo&s;t accurate
examination, di&s;covered a fibre of a du&s;ky hue,
to which the in&s;trument being applied, Mrs.
Pickle pulled it up by the roots, to the no &s;mall
di&s;compo&s;ure of the owner, who feeling the
&s;mart much more &s;evere than he had expected,
&s;tarted up, and &s;wore he would not part with
another hair to &s;ave them all from damnation.</P>
<P>Mr. Hatchway exhorted him to patience and
re&s;ignation, Mrs. Grizzle repeated her intreaties
with great humility; but finding him deaf to all
her prayers, and ab&s;olutely bent upon leaving the
hou&s;e, &s;he cla&s;ped his knees, and begged for the
love of God that he would have compa&s;&s;ion upon
a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family, and endure a little more for
the &s;ake of the poor infant, who would other|wi&s;e
be born with a grey beard upon its chin.
Far from being melted, he was rather exa&s;perated
by this reflection; to which he replied with great
indignation, &startq;Damn ye for a yaw-&s;ighted bitch!
he'll be hanged long enough before he has any
beard at all:&endq; &s;o &s;aying, he di&s;engaged him&s;elf
from her embraces, flung out at the door, and
halted homewards with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing &s;peed,
that the lieutenant could not overtake him until
he had arrived at his own gate; and Mrs. Griz|zle
was &s;o much affected with his e&s;cape, that
her &s;i&s;ter, in pure compa&s;&s;ion, de&s;ired &s;he would
not afflict her&s;elf, prote&s;ting that her own wi&s;h
was already gratified, for &s;he had plucked three
hairs at once, having from the beginning been
dubious of the commodore's forbearance. But
the labours of this affiduous kin&s;woman did not
end with the atchievement of this adventure: her
eloquence or indu&s;try were employed without
cea&s;ing, in the performance of other ta&s;ks im|po&s;ed
<PB N="41" REF="49">
by the ingenious craft of her &s;i&s;ter-in-law,
who at another time conceived an in&s;uppre&s;&s;ible
affection for a frica&s;&s;ee of frogs, which &s;hould be
the genuine natives of France; &s;o that there was
a nece&s;&s;ity for di&s;patching a me&s;&s;enger on purpo&s;e
to that kingdom: but as &s;he could not depend
upon the integrity of any common &s;ervant, Mrs.
Grizzle undertook that province, and actually
&s;et fail in a cutter for Bologne, from whence &s;he
returned in eight and forty hours with a tub full
of tho&s;e live animals, which being dre&s;&s;ed accord|ing
to art, her &s;i&s;ter would not ta&s;te them, on
pretence that her fit of longing was pa&s;t: but
then her inclinations took a different turn, and
fixed them&s;elves upon a curious implement be|longing
to a lady of quality in the neighbourhood,
which was reported to be a very great curio&s;ity;
this was no other than a porcelain chamber-pot of
admirable workman&s;hip, contrived by the honour|able
owner, who kept it for her own private u&s;e,
and cheri&s;hed it as an uten&s;il of ine&s;timable value.</P>
<P>Mrs. Grizzle &s;huddered at the fir&s;t hint &s;he re|ceived
of her &s;i&s;ter's de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s this piece of
furniture; becau&s;e &s;he knew it was not to be
purcha&s;hed; and the lady's character, which was
none of the mo&s;t amiable in point of humanity
and conde&s;cen&s;ion, forbad all hopes of borrowing
it for a &s;ea&s;on; &s;he therefore attempted to rea&s;on
down this capricious appetite, as an extravagance
of imagination which ought to be combated and
repre&s;&s;ed; and Mrs. Pickle, to all appearance,
was convinced and &s;atisfied by her arguments and
advice: but neverthele&s;s, could make u&s;e of no
other convenience, and was threatened with a
very dangerous &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. Rouzed at the peril
in which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her to be, Mrs. Grizzle
<PB N="42" REF="50">
flew to the lady's hou&s;e, and having obtained a
private audience, di&s;clo&s;ed the melancholy &s;itua|tion
of her &s;i&s;ter, and implored the benevolence
of her lady&s;hip, who, contrary to expectation,
received her very graciou&s;ly, and con&s;ented to in|dulge
Mrs. Pickle's longing: but, as &s;he had not
the plea&s;ure of being acquainted with the family,
&s;he hoped it would not be taken ami&s;s, if &s;he in|&s;i&s;ted
upon &s;ecurity for her own indemnification,
in ca&s;e any accident &s;hould happen to the machine
while under their protection. Overjoyed at this
conde&s;cen&s;ion, Mrs. Grizzle was loud in her ac|knowledgments,
embraced the terms of the loan,
in con&s;equence of which, an hundred guineas
were depo&s;ited, and brought home this illu&s;trious
Jordan, with as much plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction, as
the Argonauts enjoyed when they made them|&s;elves
ma&s;ters of the golden fleece. True it is,
her &s;ucce&s;s was attended with a &s;mall di&s;a&s;ter,
which &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee: next day it
was, at the de&s;ire of Mrs. Pickle, committed to
the charge of a tru&s;ty &s;ervant, who, in carrying
it back to the right owner, had the misfortune to
be overturned by one of her lady&s;hip's valets who
ran again&s;t him in the court; and this &s;uperb piece
of porcelain falling upon the pavement, was
da&s;hed into a thou&s;and pieces. In vain did the
poor carrier urge his own innocence, by repre&s;ent|ing
the true cau&s;e of this mi&s;adventure; her lady|&s;hip
was deaf to all his proofs and prote&s;tations,
and without any ceremony, detained the pledge
which had been left in her hands; not without
violent &s;u&s;picion of having acted as the auxiliary
of chance, to which this calamity was imputed.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, Mr. Pickle began to be out of
humour at the expence to which he was expo&s;ed
<PB N="43" REF="51">
by the caprice of his wife, who was her&s;elf
alarmed at this la&s;t accident, and for the future
kept her fancy within bounds, in&s;omuch, that
without being &s;ubject to any more extraordinary
trouble, Mrs. Grizzle reaped the long wi&s;hed
fruits of her deare&s;t expectation in the birth of a
fine boy, whom her &s;i&s;ter in a few months brought
into the world.</P>
<P>I &s;hall omit the de&s;cription of the rejoicings,
which were infinite on this important occa&s;ion,
and only ob&s;erve that Mrs. Pickle's mother and
aunt &s;tood godmothers, and the commodore a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
at the ceremony as godfather to the child,
who was chri&s;tened by the name of Peregrine,
in compliment to the memory of a decea&s;ed un|cle.
While the mother was confined to her bed,
and incapable of maintaining her own authority,
Mrs. Grizzle took charge of the infant by a dou|ble
claim; and &s;uperintended with &s;urprizing vi|gilance
the nur&s;e and midwife in all the particu|lars
of their re&s;pective offices, which were per|formed
by her expre&s;s direction. But no &s;ooner
was Mrs. Pickle in a condition to re-a&s;&s;ume the
management of her own affairs, than &s;he thought
proper to alter certain regulations concerning the
child, which had obtained in con&s;equence of her
&s;i&s;ter's orders, directing, among other innovati|ons,
that the bandages with which the infant had
been &s;o neatly rolled up, like an Aegyptian mum|my,
&s;hould be loo&s;ened and laid a&s;ide, in order to
rid nature of all re&s;traint, and give the blood free
&s;cope to circulate; and with her own hands &s;he
plunged him headlong every morning in a tub-full
of cold water. This operation &s;eemed &s;o barba|rous
to the tender-hearted Mrs. Grizzle, that &s;he
not only oppo&s;ed it with all her eloquence, &s;hed|ding
<PB N="44" REF="52">
abundance of tears over the &s;acrifice when
it was made; but took hor&s;e immediately, and
departed for the habitation of an eminent country
phy&s;ician, whom &s;he con&s;ulted in the&s;e words.
&startq;Pray, doctor, is it not both dangerous and
cruel to be the means of letting a poor tender in|fant
peri&s;h, by &s;ou&s;ing it in water as cold as ice?&endq;
&startq;Yes, replied the doctor, downright murder, I
affirm.&endq; &startq;I &s;ee you are a per&s;on of great learn|ing
and &s;agacity, &s;aid the other; and I mu&s;t beg
you will be &s;o good as to &s;ignify your opinion
in your own hand-writing.&endq; The doctor imme|diately
complied with her reque&s;t, and expre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf upon a &s;lip of paper to this purpo&s;e.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>The&s;e are to certify whom it may concern, that
I firmly believe, and it is my unalterable opi|nion,
that who&s;oever letteth an infant peri&s;h, by
&s;ou&s;ing it in cold water, even though the &s;aid water
&s;hould not be &s;o cold as ice, is in effect, guilty of
the murder of the &s;aid infant, as witne&s;s my hand</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Comfit Colocynth.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Having obtained this certificate, for which the
phy&s;ician was hand&s;omely acknowledged, &s;he re|turned
in triumph, hoping, with &s;uch authority,
to overthrow all oppo&s;ition; and accordingly next
morning, when her nephew was about to under|go
his diurnal bapti&s;m, produced the commi&s;&s;ion,
whereby &s;he conceived her&s;elf impowered to over|rule
&s;uch inhuman proceedings. But &s;he was di&s;|appointed
in her expectation, confident as it was;
not that Mrs. Pickle pretended to differ in opi|nion
from Dr. Colocynth, &startq;for who&s;e character
and &s;entiments (&s;aid &s;he) I have &s;uch veneration,
that I &s;hall carefully ob&s;erve the caution implied
in this very certificate, by which, far from con|demning
my method of practice, he only a&s;&s;erts
<PB N="45" REF="53">
that killing is murder; an a&s;&s;everation, the truth
of which, it is to be hoped, I &s;hall never di&s;pute.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Grizzle, who, &s;ooth to &s;ay, had rather
too &s;uperficially con&s;idered the clau&s;e by which
&s;he thought her&s;elf authorized, peru&s;ed the paper
with more accuracy, and was confounded at her
own want of penetration. Yet, though &s;he was
confuted, &s;he was by no means convinced that
her objections to the cold bath were unrea&s;on|able;
on the contrary, after having be&s;towed
&s;undry opprobrious epithets on the phy&s;ician, for
his want of knowledge and candour, &s;he pro|te&s;ted
in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and &s;olemn manner
again&s;t the pernicious practice of dipping the
child; a piece of cruelty, which with God's a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
&s;he &s;hould never &s;uffer to be inflicted on
her own i&s;&s;ue; and wa&s;hing her hands of the me|lancholy
con&s;equence that would certainly en&s;ue,
&s;hut her&s;elf up in her clo&s;et, to indulge her &s;or|row
and vexation. She was deceived, however,
in her progno&s;tic; the boy, in&s;tead of declining
in point of health, &s;eemed to acquire fre&s;h vigour
from every plunge, as if he had been re&s;olved to
di&s;credit the wi&s;dom and fore&s;ight of his aunt,
who, in all probability, could never forgive
him for this want of reverence and re&s;pect. This
conjecture is founded upon her behaviour to
him in the &s;equel of his infancy, during which
&s;he was known to torture him more than once,
when &s;he had opportunities of thru&s;ting pins into
his fle&s;h, without any danger of being detected.
In a word, her affections were in a little time
altogether alienated from this hope of her family,
whom &s;he abandoned to the conduct of his mo|ther,
who&s;e province it undoubtedly was to ma|nage
the nurture of her own child; while &s;he
<PB N="46" REF="54">
her&s;elf re&s;umed her operations upon the commo|dore,
whom &s;he was re&s;olved at any rate to cap|tivate
and in&s;lave. And it mu&s;t be owned, that
Mrs. Grizzle's knowledge of the human heart
never &s;hone &s;o con&s;picuous as in the methods
&s;he pur&s;ued for the accompli&s;hment of this im|portant
aim.</P>
<P>Through the rough unpoli&s;hed hu&s;k that ca&s;ed
the &s;oul of Trunnion, &s;he could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h
a large &s;hare of that vanity and &s;elf-conceit that
generally predominate even in the mo&s;t &s;avage
brea&s;t; and to this &s;he con&s;tantly appealed. In
his pre&s;ence &s;he always exclaimed again&s;t the
craft and di&s;hone&s;t di&s;&s;imulation of the world;
and never failed of uttering particular invectives
again&s;t tho&s;e arts of chicanry, in which the law|yers
are &s;o conver&s;ant to the prejudice and ruin
of their fellow creatures: ob&s;erving that in a &s;ea|faring
life, &s;o far as &s;he had opportunities of judg|ing
or being informed, there was nothing but
friend&s;hip, &s;incerity, and a hearty contempt for
every thing that was mean or &s;elfi&s;h.</P>
<P>This kind of conver&s;ation, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of certain particular civilities, in&s;en&s;ibly made an
impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of the commodore; and
that the more effectual, as his former prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons
were built upon very flender foundations:
his antipathy to old maids, which he had con|ceived
upon hear&s;ay, began gradually to dimini&s;h,
when he found they were not quite &s;uch in|fernal
animals as they had been repre&s;ented; and
it was not long; before he was heard to ob&s;erve at
the club, that Pickle's &s;i&s;ter had not &s;o much of
the core of bitch in her as he had imagined.
This negative compliment, by the medium of
her brother, &s;oon reached the ears of Mrs. Griz|zle,
<PB N="47" REF="55">
who thus encouraged, redoubled all her arts
and attention; &s;o that in le&s;s than three months
after, he in the &s;ame place di&s;tingui&s;hed her with
the epithet of a damned &s;en&s;ible jade.</P>
<P>Hatchway taking the alarm at this declaration,
which he feared foreboded &s;omething fatal to his
intere&s;t, told his commander with a &s;neer, that
&s;he had &s;en&s;e enough to bring him to, under her
&s;tern; and he did not doubt but that &s;uch an old
crazy ve&s;&s;el would be the better for being taken
in tow. &startq;But how&s;omever, added this arch ad|vi&s;er,
I'd have you take care of your upper works;
for if once you are made fa&s;t to her poop, agad!
&s;he'll &s;pank it away, and make every beam in
your body crack with &s;training.&endq; Our &s;he-pro|jector's
whole plan had like to have been ruined
by the effect which this malicious hint had upon
Trunnion, who&s;e rage and &s;u&s;picion being wak|ened
at once, his colour changed from tawny to
a cadaverous pale, and then &s;hifting to a deep and
du&s;ky red, &s;uch as we &s;ometimes ob&s;erve in the
&s;ky when it is replete with thunder, he after his
u&s;ual preamble of unmeaning oaths, an&s;wered in
the&s;e words. &startq;Damn ye, you jury-legg'd dog,
you would give all the &s;towage in your hold to be
as &s;ound as I am; and as for being taken in tow,
d'ye &s;ee, I'm not &s;o di&s;abled but that I can lie my
cour&s;e, and perform my voyage without any a&s;|&s;i&s;tance;
and, agad! no man &s;hall ever &s;ee
Haw&s;er Trunnion lagging a-&s;tern in the wake of
e'er a bitch in chri&s;tendom.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Grizzle, who every morning interrogated
her brother with regard to the &s;ubjeot of his
night's conver&s;ation with his friends, &s;oon re|ceived
the unwelcome news of the commodore's
aver&s;ion to matrimony; and ju&s;tly imputing the
<PB N="48" REF="56">
greate&s;t part of his di&s;gu&s;t to the &s;atyrical in&s;i|nuations
of Mr. Hatchway, re&s;olved to level this
ob&s;truction to her &s;ucce&s;s, and actually found
means to intere&s;t him in her &s;cheme. She had
indeed, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, a particular knack at
making converts, being probably not unacquainted
with that grand &s;y&s;tem of per&s;ua&s;ion, which is
adopted by the greate&s;t per&s;onages of the age, as
fraught with maxims much more effectual than
all the eloquence of Tully or Demo&s;thenes, even
when &s;upported by the demon&s;trations of truth:
be&s;ides, Mr. Hatchway's fidelity to his new ally,
was confirmed by his fore&s;eeing in his captain's
marriage an infinite fund of gratification for his
own cynical di&s;po&s;ition. Thus, therefore, con|verted
and properly cautioned, he for the future
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed all the virulence of his wit again&s;t the
matrimonial &s;tate; and as he knew not how to
open his mouth in the po&s;itive prai&s;e of any per|&s;on whatever, took all opportunities of excepting
Mrs. Grizzle by name, from the cen&s;ures he li|berally
be&s;towed upon the re&s;t of her &s;ex. &startq; She
is not a drunkard, like Nan Ca&s;tick of Dept&s;ord,
he would &s;ay; nor a nincompoop, like Peg Sim|per
of Woolwich; nor a brim&s;tone, like Klate
Coddle of Chatham; nor a &s;hrew, like Nell Grif|fin
on the Point Port&s;mouth;&endq;' (ladies to whom at
different times, they had both paid their addre&s;&s;es)
but a tight, good humoured &s;en&s;ible wench, who
knows very well how to. box her compa&s;s; well
trimmed alo&s;t, and well &s;hcathed alow, with a
good commodity under her hatches.&endq; The com|modore
at fir&s;t imagined this commendation was
ironical, but hearing it repeated again and again,
was filled with a&s;toni&s;hment at this &s;urpri&s;ing
change in the lieutenant's behaviours and after a
<PB N="49" REF="57">
long fit of mu&s;ing, concluded that Hatchway
him&s;elf harboured a matrimonial de&s;ign on the
per&s;on of Mrs. Grizzle.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed with this conjecture, he rallied Jack in
his turn, and one night toa&s;ted her health as a
compliment to his pa&s;&s;ion; a circum&s;tance which
the lady learning next day by the u&s;ual canal of
her intelligence, and interpreting as the re&s;ult of
his own tenderne&s;s for her, &s;he congratulated
her&s;elf upon the victory &s;he had obtained; and
thinking it unnece&s;&s;ary to continue the re&s;erve
&s;he had hitherto indu&s;triou&s;ly affected, re&s;olved
from that day to &s;weeten her behaviour towards
him with &s;uch a da&s;h of affection, as could not
fail to per&s;uade him that he had in&s;pired her with
a reciprocal flame. In con&s;equence of this de|termination
he was invited to dinner, and while
he &s;taid, treated with &s;uch cloying proofs of her
regard, that not only the re&s;t of the company,
but even Trunnion him&s;elf perceived her dri&s;t;
and taking the alarm accordingly, could not help
exclaiming, &startq;Oho! I &s;ee how the land lies, and$word$
I don't weather the point, I'll be clamn'd.&endq;
Having thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his afflicted ina|morata,
he made the be&s;t of his way to the gar|$$&s;on,
in which he &s;hut him&s;elf up for the &s;pacc of
ten days, and had no communication with his
friends and dome&s;ticks but by looks, which were
mo&s;t &s;ignificantly picture&s;que.</P>

<P>THIS abrupt departure and unkind declara|tion
affected Mrs. Grizzle &s;o much, that
&s;he &s;ell &s;ick of &s;orrow and mortification; and after
having confined her&s;elf to her bed for three days,
&s;ent for her brother, told him &s;he perceived her
end drawing near, and de&s;ired that a lawyer
might be brought, in order to write her la&s;t will&punc;
Mr. Pickle &s;urpri&s;ed at her demand, began to act
the part of a comforter, a&s;&s;uring her that her
di&s;temper was not at all dangerous; and that he
would in&s;tantly &s;end for a phy&s;ician, who would
convince her that &s;he was in no manner of jeo|pardy;
&s;o that there was no occa&s;ion at pre&s;ent,
to employ any officious attorney in &s;uch a melan|choly
ta&s;k. Indeed, this affectionate brother wa$
of opinion that a will was altogether &s;uperfluous
at any rate, as he him&s;elf was heir at law to his
&s;i&s;ter's whole real and per&s;onal e&s;tate. But &s;he
in&s;i&s;ted upon his compliance with &s;uch determined
ob&s;tinacy, that he could no longer re&s;i&s;t her im|portunities; and a &s;crivener arriving, &s;he dictate$
and executed her will, in which &s;he bequeath$
to commodore Trunnion one thou&s;and pounds
to purcha&s;e a mourning ring, which &s;he hope
he would wear as a pledge of her friend&s;hip an$
affection. Her brother, though he did not muc$
$eli&s;h this te&s;timony of her love, neverthele&s;s th$$
&s;ame evening gave an account of this particular
<PB N="51" REF="59">
to Mr. Hatchway, who was al&s;o, as Mr. Pickle
a&s;&s;ured him, generou&s;ly remembered by the te&s;ta|&s;trix.</P>
<P>The lieutenant fraught with this piece of intel|ligence,
watched for an opportunity, and as &s;oon
as he perceived the commodore's features a little
unbended from that ferocious contraction they had
&s;uffered &s;o long, ventured to inform him that
Pickle's &s;i&s;ter lay at the point of death, and that
&s;he had left him a thou&s;and pounds in her will.
This piece of news overwhelmed him with con|fu&s;ion,
and Mr. Hatchway imputing his &s;ilence
to remor&s;e, re&s;olved to take advantage of that
favourable moment, and coun&s;elled him to go
and vi&s;it the poor young woman, who was dying
for love of him. But his admonition happened
to be &s;omewhat un&s;ea&s;onable; for Trunnion no
&s;ooner heard him mention the cau&s;e of her di&s;or|der
than his moro&s;ity recurring, he bur&s;t out
into a violent fit of cur&s;ing, and forthwith betook
him&s;elf again to his hammock, where he lay ut|tering
in a low growling tone of voice, a repeti|tion
of oaths and imprecations, for the &s;pace of
four and twenty hours, without cea&s;ing. This
was a delicious meal to the lieutenant, who eager
to inhance the plea&s;ure of the entertainment &s;till
more, and at the &s;ame time conduce to the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of the cau&s;e he had e&s;pou&s;ed, invented a
&s;tratagem, the execution of which had all the ef|fect
he could de&s;ire. He prevailed upon Pipes,
who was devoted to his &s;ervicc, to get upon the
top of the chimney belonging to the commodore's
chamber, at midnight, and to lower down by a rope
a bunch of &s;tinkina whitings, which being per&s;o$$|ed,
he put a &s;peaking-trumpet to his mouth, and
hollowed down the next, in a voice $word$ thunder,
<PB N="52" REF="60">
&startq;Trunnion! Trunnion! turn out and be &s;pliced,
or lie &s;till and be damned.&endq; This dreadful note,
the terror of which was increa&s;ed by the &s;ilencc
and darkne&s;s of the night, as well as the eccho of
the pa&s;&s;age through which it was conveyed, n$
&s;ooner reached the ears of the a&s;toni&s;hed commo|dore,
than turning his eye towards the place from
whence this &s;olemn addre&s;s &s;eemed to proceed,
he beheld a glittering object that vani&s;hed in an
in&s;tant; and ju&s;t as his &s;uper&s;titious fear had im|proved
the apparition into &s;ome &s;upernatural me&s;|&s;enger
cloathed in &s;hining array, his opinion was
confirmed by a &s;udden explo&s;ion, which he took
for thunder, though it was no other than the
noi&s;e of a pi&s;tol fired down the chimney by the
boat&s;wain'a mate, according to the in&s;tructions
he had received; and he had time enough to de|&s;cend before he was in any danger of being de|tected
by his commander, who could not for a
whole hour recollect him&s;elf from the amazement
and con&s;ternation which had overpowered his &s;a|culties.</P>
<P>At length, however, he got up and rung his
bell with great agitation. He repeated the &s;um|mons more than once, but no regard being paid
to this alarm, his dread returned with double ter|ror,
a cold &s;weet bedewed his limbs, his knees
knocked together, his hair bri&s;tled up, and the
remains of his teeth were &s;hattered to pieces in
the convul&s;ive vibrations of his jaws.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this agony he made one de&s;pe|rate effort, and bur&s;ting open the door of his
apartment, bolted into Hatchway's chamber,
which happened to be on the &s;ame floor; and
there found the lieutenant in a counterfeit &s;woon,
who pretended to wake from his trance in an $ja|culation

of &startq;Lord have mercy upon us!&endq;$WORD$
being que&s;tioned by the terrified commodore with
regard to what had: appened, a&s;&s;ured him he had
heard the &s;ame voice ard clap of thunder by
which Trunnion him&s;elf had been di&s;compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Pipes, who&s;e turn it was to watch, concurred
in giving evidence to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and the
commodore not only owned that he had heard
the voice, but likewi&s;e communicated hu vi&s;ion,
with all the aggravation which his di&s;turbed fancy
&s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>A con&s;ultation immediately en&s;ued, in which
Mr. Hatchway very gravely ob&s;erved, that the
finger of God was plainly perceivable in tho&s;e &s;ig|nals;
and that it would be both &s;inful and fooli&s;h
to di&s;regard his commands, e&s;pecially as the match
propo&s;ed was, in all re&s;pects, more advantage|ous
than any that one of his years and infirmities
could rea&s;onably expect; declaring that for his
own part he would not endanger his &s;oul and
body by living one day longer under the &s;ame
roof with a man who de&s;pi&s;ed the holy will of
heaven; and Tom Pipes adhered to the &s;ame
pi$us re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Trunnion's per&s;everance could not re&s;i&s;t the
number and diver&s;ity of con&s;iderations that a&s;|&s;aulted
it; he revolved in &s;ilence all the oppo&s;ite
motives that occurred to his reflection; and after
having been, to all appearance, bewildered in the
labyrinth of his own thoughts, he wiped the &s;weat
from his forehead, and heaving a piteous groan,
yielded to their remon&s;trances in the&s;e words:
&startq;Well, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, I think we mu&s;t
$'en grapple. But damn my eyes! &startq;'tis a damn'd

<P>This important article being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, Mr.
Hatchway &s;et out in the morning to vi&s;it the de|&s;pairing
&s;hepherde&s;s, and was hand&s;omely re|warded
for the enlivening tidings with which he
ble&s;&s;ed her ears. Sick as &s;he was, &s;he could not
help laughing heartily at the contrivance, in
con&s;equence of which her &s;wain's a&s;&s;ent had been
obtained, and gave the lieutenant ten guineas for
Tom Pipes, in con&s;ideration of the part he acted
in the farce.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the commodore &s;uffered
him&s;elf to be conveyed to her apartment, like a
$elon to execution, and was received by her in a
langui&s;hing manner and genteel di&s;habille, ac|companied
by her &s;i&s;ter-in law; who was, for
very obvious rea&s;ons, extremely &s;ollicitous about
her &s;ucce&s;s. Though the lieutenant had tutored
him touching his behaviour at this interview, he
made a thou&s;and wry faces before he could pro|nounce
the &s;imple &s;alutation of <HI>How d'ye?</HI> to his
mi&s;tre&s;s; and after his coun&s;ellor had urged him
with twenty or thirty whi&s;pers, to each of which
he had replied aloud, &startq;Damn your eyes I won't,&endq;
he got up, and halting towards the couch on
which Mrs. Grizzle reclined in a &s;tate of &s;trange
expectation, he &s;eized her hand and pre&s;&s;ed it to
his lips; but this piece of gallantry he performed
in &s;uch a reluctant, uncouth, indignant manner,
that the nymph had need of all her re&s;olution to
endure the compliment without &s;hrinking; and
he him&s;elf was &s;o di&s;concerted at what he had
done, that he in&s;tantly retired to the other end of
the room, where he &s;at &s;ilent, and broiled with
&s;hame and vexation. Mrs, Pickle, like a &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="55" REF="63">
matron, quitted the place, on pretence of going
to the nur&s;ery; and Mr. Hatchway taking the
hint, recollected that he had le&s;t his tobacco pouch
in the parlour, whither he immediately de&s;cendedy,
leaving the two lovers to their mutual endear|ments.
Never had the commodore found him&s;elf
in &s;uch a di&s;agreeable dilemma before. He &s;at in
an agony of &s;u&s;pence, as if he every moment
dreaded the di&s;&s;olution of nature; and the implor|ing
&s;ighs of his future bride added, if po&s;&s;ible,
to the pangs of his di&s;tre&s;s. Impatient of his
&s;ituation, he rolled his eye around in que&s;t of
&s;ome relief, and unable to contain him&s;elf, ex|c$almed,
&startq;Damnation &s;eize the fellow and his
pouch too! I believe he. has &s;heered off, and left
me here in the &s;tays. &endq; Mrs.Grizzle, who could
not help taking &s;ome notice of this manife&s;tation
of chagrin, lamented her unhappy fate in being
&s;o di&s;agreeable to him that he could not put up
with her company for a few moments without
rep$ning; and began in very tender terms to re|proach
him with his inhumanity and indifference.
To this expo&s;tulation he replied, &startq;Zounds!
what would the woman have? let the par&s;on do
his office when he wool, here I am ready to be
reeved in the matrimonial block, d'ye &s;ee, and
damn all non&s;en&s;ical palaver.&endq; So &s;aying, he re|treated,
leaving his mi&s;tre&s;s not at all di&s;obliged
at his plain-dealing. That &s;ame evening the treaty
of marriage was brought upon the carpet, and by
means of Mr. Pickle and the lieutenant &s;ettled
to the &s;atisfaction, of all parties, without the inter|vention
of lawyers, whom Mr. Trunnion ex|pre&s;sly
excluded from all &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s;
making that condition the indi&s;pen&s;ible prelimi|nary
of the whole agreement. Things being
<PB N="56" REF="64">
brought to this bearing, Mrs. Grizzle's heart di|lated
with joy; her health, which by the bye
was never dangerou&s;ly impaired, &s;he recovered as
if by inchantment, and a day being fixed for the
nuptials, employed the &s;hort period of her celi|bacy
in choo&s;ing ornaments for the celebration of
her entrance into the married &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preparations are made for the commodore's wed|ding,
which is delayed by an accident that hur|ried
him the Lord knows whither.</HEAD>
<P>THE fame of this extraordinary conjunction
&s;pread all over the county; and on the
day appointed for their &s;pou&s;als, the church was
&s;urrounded by an inconceivable multitude. The
commodore, to give a &s;pecimen of his gallantry,
by the advice of his friend Hatchway, re&s;olved
to appear on hor&s;eback on the grand occa&s;ion, at
the head of all his male attendants, whom he had
rigged with the white &s;hirts and black caps for|merly
belonging to his barge's crew; and he
bought a couple of hunters for the accommoda|tion
of himfelf and his lieutenant. With this
equipage then he &s;et out from the garri&s;on for the
church, after having di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to
apprize the bride that he and his company were
mounted; whereupon &s;he got immediately into
the coach, accompanied by her brother and his
wife, and drove directly to the place of a&s;&s;igna|tion,
where &s;everal pew$ were demoli&s;ed, and
divers per&s;ons almo&s;t pre&s;&s;ed to death, by the ea|gerne&s;s
of the crowd that broke in to &s;ee the ce|remony
performed. Thus arrived at the altar,
and the prie&s;t in attendance, they waited a whole
<PB N="57" REF="65">
half hour for the commodore, at who&s;e &s;lowne&s;s
they began to be under &s;ome apprehen&s;ion, and
accordingly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed a &s;ervant to quicken his
pace. The valet having rode &s;omething more
than a mile, e&s;pied the whole troop di&s;po&s;ed in a
long field, cro&s;&s;ing the road obliquely, and headed
by the bridegroom and his friend Hatchway, who
finding him&s;elf hindered by a hedge from pro|ceeding
farther in the &s;ame direction, fired a
pi&s;tol, and &s;tood over to the other &s;ide, making
an obtu&s;e angle with the line of his former cour&s;e;
and the re&s;t of the &s;quadron followed his exam|ple,
keeping always in the rear of each other,
like a flight of wild gee&s;e.</P>
<P>Surprized at this &s;trange method of journeying,
the me&s;enger came up, and told the commodore
that his lady and her company expected him in
the church, where they had tarried a con&s;iderable
time, and were beginning to be very unea&s;y at his
dealy; and therefore defired he would proceed
with more expedition. To this me&s;&s;age Mr.
Trunnion replied, &startq;Hark ye, brother, don't
you &s;ee we make all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed? go back and
tell tho&s;e who &s;ent you, that the wind has &s;hifted
&s;ince we weighed anchor, and that we are obliged
to make very &s;hort trips in tacking, by rea&s;on of
the narrowne&s;s of the channel; and that as we
he within &s;ix points of the wind, they mu&s;t
make &s;ome allowance for variation and leeway.&endq;
&startq;Lord, Sir! &s;aid the vale$, what occa&s;ion have
you to go zig zag in that manner? Do but clap
&s;purs to your hou&s;es, and ride &s;traight forward,
and I'11 engage you &s;hall be at the church porch
in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour.&endq; &startq;What!
right in the wind's eye? an&s;wered the commander,
$hey! brother, where did you learn your naviga|tion?
<PB N="58" REF="66">
Haw&s;er Trunnion is not to be taught at
this time of day how to lie his cour&s;e, or keep
his own reckoning. And as for you, brother,
you know be&s;t the trim of your own frigate.&endq;
The courier finding he had to do with people
who would not be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded out of their
own opinions, returned to the temple, and made a
report of what he had &s;een and heard, to the no
&s;mall con&s;olation of the bride, who had begun to
di&s;cover &s;ome &s;igns of di&s;quiet. Compo&s;ed, how|ever,
by this piece of intelligence, &s;he exerted her
patience for the &s;pace of another half hour, dur|ing
which period &s;eeing no bridegroom arrive,
&s;he was exceedingly alarmed; &s;o that all the &s;pec|tators
could ea&s;ily perceive her perturbation, which
manife&s;ted it&s;elf in frequent palpitations, heart|heavings,
and alterations of countenance, in &s;pite
of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;melling-bottle which &s;he
ince&s;&s;antly applied to her no&s;trils.</P>
<P>Various were the conjectures of the company
on this occa&s;ion; &s;ome imagined he had mi&s;taken
the place of rendezvous, as he had never been at
church &s;ince he fir&s;t &s;ettled in that pari&s;h; others
believed he had met with &s;ome accident, in con|&s;equence
of which his attendants had carried him
back to his own hou&s;e; and a third &s;et, in which
the bride her&s;elf was thought to be comprehended,
could not help &s;u&s;pecting that the commodore had
changed his mind. But all the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions,
ingenious as they were, happened to be wide of
the true cau&s;e that detained him, which was no
other than this: the commodore and his crew
had by dint of turning, almo&s;t weathered the
par&s;on's hou&s;e that &s;tood to windwa$d of the
church, when the notes of a pack of hounds un|luckily
reached the ears of the two hunters which
<PB N="59" REF="67">
Trunnion and the lieutenant be&s;trode. The&s;e fleet
animals no &s;ooner heard the enlivening &s;ound,
than eager for the chace they &s;prung away all of a
&s;udden, and &s;training every nerve to partake of
the &s;port, flew acro&s;s the fields with incredible
&s;peed, overleaping hedges and ditches, and every
thing in their way, without the lea&s;t regard to
their unfortunate riders. The lieutenant, who&s;e
&s;teed had got the heels of the other, finding it
would be great folly and pre&s;umption in him to
pretend to keep the &s;addle with his wooden leg,
very wi&s;ely took the opportunity of throwing
him&s;elf off in his pa&s;&s;age through a field of rich
clover, among which he lay at his ea&s;e; and
&s;eeing his captain advancing at full gallop, hailed
him with the &s;alutation of &startq;What chear? ho!&endq;
The commodore, who was in infinite di&s;tre&s;s, eying
him a&s;kance, as he pa&s;&s;ed, replied with a faul|tering
voice, &startq;O damn ye! you are &s;afe at an
anchor; I wi&s;h to God I were as fa&s;t moored.&endq;
Neverthele&s;s, con&s;cious of his di&s;abled heel, he
would not venture to try the &s;ame experiment
which had &s;ucceeded &s;o well with Hatchway, but
re&s;olved to &s;tick as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible to his hor&s;e's
back, until providence &s;hould interpo&s;e in his be|half.
With this view he dropped his whip, and
with his right hand laid fa&s;t hold on the pummel,
contracting every mu&s;cle in his body to &s;ecure
him&s;elf in the &s;eat, and grinning mo&s;t formidably,
in con&s;equence of this exertion. In this attitude
he was hurried on a con&s;iderable way, when all
of a &s;udden his view was comforted by a five bar
gate that appeared before him, as he never doubt|ed
that there the career of his hunter mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
end. But, alas! he reckoned without his
ho&s;t; far from halting at this ob&s;truction, tho
<PB N="60" REF="68">
hor&s;e &s;prung over it with amazing agility, to the
utter confu&s;ion and di&s;order of his owner, who
lo&s;t his hat and periwig in the leap, and now be|gan
to think in good earne&s;t, that he was actually
mounted on the back of the devil. He recom|mended
him&s;elf to God, his reflection for&s;ook
him, his eye-&s;ight and all his other &s;en&s;es failed,
he quitted the reins, and fa&s;tening by in&s;tinct on
the mane, was in this condition conveyed into the
mid&s;t of the &s;port&s;men, who were a&s;toni&s;hed at
the &s;ight of &s;uch an apparition. Neither was their
&s;urprize to be wondered at, if we reflect on the
figure that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to their view. The
commodore's per&s;on was at all times an object of
admiration; much more &s;o on this occa&s;ion,
when every &s;ingularity was aggravated by the cir|cum&s;tances
of his dre&s;s and di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>He had put on in honour of his nuptials his be&s;t
cont of blue broad cloth, cut by a taylor of Ram&s;|gate,
and trimmed with five dozen of bra&s;s but|tons,
large and &s;mall; his breeches were of the
&s;ame piece, fa&s;tened at the knees with large
bunches of tape; his wai&s;tcoat was of red plu$
la$elled with green velvet, and garni&s;hed with
velium holes; his boots bore an intimate re&s;em|blance
both in colour and &s;hape to a pair of lea|thern
buckets; his &s;houlder was graced with a
broad buff belt, from whence depended a huge
hanger with a hil$ like that of a back&s;word; and
on each &s;ide of his pummel appeared a ru&s;ty pi&s;|tol
rammed in a ca&s;e covered with bear-&s;kin.
The lo&s;s of his tye-periwig and laced hat, which
were curio&s;ities of the kind, did not at all contri|bute
to the improvement of the picture, but on
the contrary, by exhibiting his bald pate, and the
natural exten&s;ion of his lanthorn jaws, added to
<PB N="61" REF="69">
the peculiarity and extravagance of the whole.
Such a &s;pectacle could not have failed of di|verting
the whole company from the chace, had
his hor&s;e thought proper to pur&s;ue a different
route, but the bea&s;t was too keen a &s;porter to
choo&s;e any other way than that which the &s;tag
followed; and therefore, without &s;topping to gra|tify
the curio&s;ity of the &s;pectators, he in a few mi|nutes
out&s;tripped every hunter in the field; and
there being a deep hollow way betwixt him and
the hounds, rather than ride round about the
length of a furlong to a path that cro&s;&s;ed the lane,
he tran&s;ported him&s;elf at one jump, to the un|&s;peakable
a&s;toni&s;hment and terror of a waggoner
who chanced to be underneath, and &s;aw this phe|nomenon
fly over his carriage. This was not the
only adventure he atchieved. The &s;tag having
taken a deep river that lay in his way, every man
directed his cour&s;e to a bridge in the neigh|bourhood;
but our bridegroom's cour&s;er de&s;pi&s;ing
all &s;uch conveniences, plunged into the &s;tream
without he&s;itation, and &s;wam in a twinkling to
the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. This &s;udden immer&s;ion into
an element of which Trunnion was properly a
native, in all probability helped to recruit the
exhu&s;ted &s;pirits of his rider, who at his landing
on the other &s;ide give &s;ome tokens of &s;en&s;ation,
by hollowing aloud for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he could
not po&s;&s;ibly receive, becau&s;e his hor&s;e &s;till main|tained
the advantage he had gained, and would
not allow him&s;elf to be overtaken.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, after a long chace that la&s;ted &s;everal
hours, and extended to a dozen miles at lea&s;t, he
was the fir&s;t in at the death of the deer, being &s;e|$ded
by the lieutenant's gelding, which actuated
<PB N="62" REF="70">
by the &s;ame &s;pirit, had, without a rider, followed
his companion's example.</P>
<P>Our bridegroom finding him&s;elf at la&s;t brought
up, or in other words, at the end of his career,
took the opportunity of this fir&s;t pau&s;e, to de&s;ire
the hunt&s;men would lend him a hand in di&s;|mounting;
and was by their conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;afely
placed on the gra&s;s, where he &s;at &s;taring at the
company as they came in, with &s;uch wildne&s;s of
a&s;toni&s;hment in his looks, as if he had been a
creature of another &s;pecies, dropt among them
from the clouds.</P>
<P>Before they had fle&s;hed the hounds, however,
he recollected him&s;elf, and &s;eeing one of the
&s;port&s;men take a &s;mall fla&s;k out of his pocket and
apply it to his mouth, judged the cordial to be no
other than neat Coniac, which it really was; and
expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire of participation, was immedi|ately
accommodated with a moderate do&s;e, which
perfectly compleated his recovery.</P>
<P>By this time he and his two hor&s;es had en|gro&s;&s;ed
the attention of the whole crowd; while
&s;ome admired the elegant proportion and un|common
&s;pirit of the two animals, the re&s;t con|templated
the &s;urpri&s;ing appearance of their ma|&s;ter,
whom before they had only &s;een <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant</HI>;
and at length, one of the gentlemen, acco&s;ting
him very courteou&s;ly, &s;ignified his wonder at
&s;eeing him in &s;uch an equipage, and a&s;ked if he
had not dropped his companion by the way.
&startq;Why, look ye, brother, (replied the com|modore)
mayhap you think me an odd &s;ort of a
fellow, &s;eeing me in this trim, e&s;pecially as I
have lo&s;t part of my rigging; but this here is the
ca&s;e, d'ye &s;ee: I weighed anchor from my own
hou&s;e this morning at ten A.M. with fair wea|ther,
<PB N="63" REF="71">
and a favourable breeze at &s;outh &s;outh|ea&s;t,
being bound to the next church, on the
voyage of matrimony: but how&s;omever, we had
not run down a quarter of a league, when the
wind &s;hifting, blowed directly in our teeth; &s;o
that we were forced to tack all the way, d'ye &s;ee,
and had almo&s;t beat up within &s;ight of port,
when the&s;e &s;ons of bitches of hor&s;es, which I
had bought but two days before (for my own
part, I believe they are devils incarnate) luffed
round in a trice, and then refu&s;ing the helm,
drove away like lightning with me and my lieu|tenant,
who &s;oon came to anchor in an exceed|ing
good birth. As for my own part, I have
been carried over rocks, and flats, and quick|&s;ands;
among which I have pitched away a &s;pe|cial
good tye-periwig, and an iron-bound hat;
and at la&s;t, thank God! am got into &s;mooth wa|ter
and &s;afe riding: but if ever I venture my car|ca&s;e
upon &s;uch a hare'um &s;care'um blood of a
bitch again, my name is not Haw&s;er Trunnion,
d&mdash;n my eyes!&endq;</P>
<P>One of the company, &s;truck with this name,
which he had often heard, immediately laid hold
on his declaration at the clo&s;e of this &s;ingular ac|count;
and ob&s;erving that his hor&s;es were very
vicious, a&s;ked how he intended to return? &startq;As
for that matter, (replied Mr. Trunnion) I am
re&s;olved to hire a &s;ledge or waggon, or &s;uch a
thing as a jack-a&s;s; for I'll be d&mdash;n'd if ever I
cro&s;s the back of a hor&s;e again.&endq; &startq;And what
do you propo&s;e to do with the&s;e creatures? (&s;aid
the other, pointing to the hunters) they &s;eem to
have &s;ome mettle; but then they are meer colts,
and will take the devil and all of breaking.
Methinks this hither one is &s;houlder &s;lipped.&endq;
<PB N="64" REF="72">
&startq;Damn them, (cried the commodore) I wi&s;h
both their necks were broke, tho$ the two co&s;t
me forty good yellow-boys,&endq; &startq;Forty guineas!
(exclaimed the &s;tranger, who was a &s;quire and a
jocky, as well as owner of the pack) Lord!
Lord! how a man may be impo&s;ed upon! Why,
the&s;e cattle are clum&s;y enough to go to plow:
mind what a flat counter; do but ob&s;erve how
&s;harp this here one is in the withers; then he's
fired in the further &s;etlock.&endq; In &s;hort, this con|noi&s;&s;eur
in hor&s;e-fle&s;h, having di&s;covered in them
all the defects which can po&s;&s;ibly be found in that
&s;pecies of animals, offered to give him ten gui|neas
for the two, &s;aying, he would convert them
into bea&s;ts of burthen. The owner, who (after
what had happened) was very well di&s;po&s;ed to
li&s;ten to any thing that was &s;aid to their preju|dice,
implicitly believed the truth of the &s;tran|ger's
a&s;&s;everations, di&s;charged a furious volley
of oaths again&s;t the ra&s;cal who had taken him
in, and forthwith &s;truck a bargain with the
&s;quire, who paid him in&s;tantly for his purcha&s;e;
in con&s;equence of which he won the plate at the
next Canterbury races.</P>
<P>This affair being tran&s;acted to the mutual &s;a|tisfaction
of both parties, as well as to the gene|ral
entertainment of the company, who laughed
in their &s;leeves at the dexterity of their friend,
Trunnion was &s;et upon the &s;quire's own hor&s;e,
and led by his &s;ervant in the mid&s;t of this caval|cade,
which proceeded to a neighbouring village,
where they had be&s;poke dinner, and where our
bridegroom &s;ound means to provide him&s;elf with
another hat and wig. With regard to his mar|riage,
he bore his di&s;appointment with the tem|per
of a philo&s;opher; and the exerci&s;e he had
<PB N="65" REF="73">
undergone having quickened his appetite, &s;at
down at table in the mid&s;t of his new acquaint|ance,
making a very hearty meal, and moi&s;tening

<P>MEAN while lieutenant Hatchway made
&s;hift to hobble to the church, where he

her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, to the &s;urprize of all the &s;pec|tators,
who could not comprehend the cau&s;e of
her di&s;order; and when &s;he was recovered by
the application of &s;melling-bottles, earne&s;tly
legged that Mr. Hatchway and Tom Pipes would
take her brother's coach, and go in que&s;t of

the par&s;on's hou&s;e, and the ceremony deferred
t$$l another occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The lieutenant, &s;teering his cour&s;e as near the
line of direction in which Trunnion went off as
the coach-road would permit, got intelligence of
<PB N="66" REF="74">
his track from one farm-hou&s;e to another; for
&s;uch an apparition could not fail of attracting par|ticular
notice; and one of the hor&s;emen having
picked up his hat and wig in a bye-path, the whole
troop entered the village where he was lodged,
about four o'clock in the afternoon. When they
under&s;tood he was &s;afely hou&s;ed at the George,

were instructed in the nature of the &s;alute by
Trunnion, who by this time had entered into

more than half &s;eas over. The lieutenant was
introduced to all pre&s;ent as his &s;worn brother,
and had &s;omething t***&s;&s;ed up for his dinner. Tom
Pipes and the crew were regaled in another room;

about &s;ix in the evening the commodore, with

having &s;hook hands with every individual in the
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Without any farther accident he was con|veyed
in &s;afety to his own gate before nine, and
committed to the care of Pipes, who carried him

when he a&s;&s;ured them that his commodore

and plea&s;antry at the account he gave of Trun|nion's
adventure.</P>
<P>Another day was fixed for the nuptials; and,
in order to baulk the curio&s;ity of idle people,
which had given great offence, the par&s;on was
prevailed upon to perform the ceremony in the

garri&s;on, which all that day was adorned with
flags and pendants di&s;played, and at night illumi|nated
by the direction of Hatchway, who al&s;o
ordered the patereroes to be fired as &s;oon as the
marriage knot was tied. Neither were the other
parts of the entertainment neglected by this inge|nious
contriver, who produced undeniable proofs
of his elegance and art in the wedding-&s;upper,
which had been committed to his management
and direction. This general banquet was in|tirely
compo&s;ed of &s;ea-di&s;hes; a huge pillaw,
con&s;i&s;ting of a large piece of beef &s;liced, a couple
of fowls, and half a peck of rice, &s;moaked in
the middle of the board: a di&s;h of hard fi&s;h
&s;wimming in oil appeared at each end, the &s;ides
being furni&s;hed with a me&s;s of that &s;avoury com|po&s;ition
known by the name of lob's cour&s;e, and
a plate of &s;almagundy. The &s;econd cour&s;e di&s;|played
a goo&s;e of a mon&s;trous magnitude, flanked
with two Guinea hens, a pig barbecu'd, an hock
of &s;alt pork in the mid&s;t of a pea&s;e-pudding, a
leg of mutton roa&s;ted, with potatoes, and another
boiled, with yam$. The third &s;ervice was made
up of a loin of fre&s;h pork with apple-&s;auce, a kid
&s;mothered with onions, and a terrapin baked in
the &s;hell: and la&s;t of all, a prodigious &s;ea-pye
was pre&s;ented, with an infinite volume of pan|cakes
and fritters. That every thing might be
an&s;werable to the magnificence of this delicate
$e$&s;t, he had provided va&s;t quantities of &s;trong
beer, flip, rumbo, and burnt brandy, with plenty
of Barbadoes water for the ladies; and hired all
the fiddles within &s;ix miles, who, with the addi|tion
of a drum, bag-pipe, and Welch-harp, re|galed
the gue&s;ts with a mo&s;t melodious concert.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="76">
The company, who were not at all exceptio$s,
&s;eemed extremely well plea&s;ed with every parti|cular
of the entertainment; and the evening be|ing
&s;pent in the mo&s;t &s;ocial manner, the bride
was by her &s;i&s;ter conducted to her apartment,
where, however, a trifling circum&s;tance had like
to have de&s;troyed the harmony which had been
hitherto maintained.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that there was not
one &s;tanding bed within the walls; there&s;ore the
reader will not wonder that Mrs. Trunnion
was out of humour, when &s;he found her&s;elf un|der
the nece&s;&s;ity of being confined with her &s;pou&s;e
in a hammock, which tho' enlarged with a dou|ble
portion of canvas, and dilated with a yoke
for the occa&s;ion, was at be&s;t but a di&s;agreeable,
not to &s;ay dangerous &s;ituation. She accordingly
complained with &s;ome warmth of this inconve|nience,
which &s;he imputed to di&s;re&s;pect, and at
fir&s;t ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to put up with the expe|dient:
but Mrs. Pickle &s;oon brought her to rea|&s;on
and compliance, by ob&s;erving that one night
would &s;oon be elap&s;ed, and next day &s;he might
regulate her own oeconomy.</P>
<P>Thus per&s;uaded, &s;he ventured into the vehicle,
and was vi&s;ited by her hu&s;band in le&s;s than an
hour, the company being departed to their own
homes, and the garri&s;on left to the command of
his lieutenant and mate. But it &s;eems the hooks
that &s;upported this &s;winging couch were not calcu|lated
for the addition of weight which they were
now de&s;tined to bear; and therefore gave way in
the middle of the night, to the no &s;mall terror of
Mrs. Trunnion, who perceiving her&s;elf falling,
&s;creamed aloud, and by that exclamation brought
Hatchway with a light into the chamber. Tho'
<PB N="69" REF="77">
&s;he had received no injury by the fall &s;he was
extremely di&s;compo&s;ed and incen&s;ed at the acci|dent,
which &s;he even openly a&s;cribed to the ob|&s;tinacy
and whim&s;ical oddity of the commodore,
in &s;uch petulant terms as evidently declared that
&s;he thought her great aim accompli&s;hed, and her
authority &s;ecured again&s;t all the &s;hocks of fortune.
Indeed her bedfellow &s;eemed to be of the &s;ame
opinion, by his tacit re&s;ignation; for he made no
reply to her in&s;inuations, but with a mo&s;t vinegar
a&s;pect crawled out of his ne&s;t, and betook him|&s;elf
to re&s;t in another apartment, while his irri|tated
&s;pou&s;e di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the lieutenant, and from
the wreck of the hammock made an occa&s;ional
b$d for her&s;elf on the floor, fully determined to
provide better accommodation for next night's
lodging.</P>
<P>Having no inclination to &s;leep, her thoughts
during the remaining part of the night were en|gr$&s;&s;ed
by a &s;cheme of reformation &s;he was re|$$ved
to execute in the family; and no &s;ooner
did the fir&s;t lark bid &s;alutation to the morn, than
$tarting from her humble couch, and huddling on
her cloaths, &s;he &s;allied from her chamber, ex|plored
her way thro' paths before unknown, and
in the cour&s;e of her re&s;earches perceived a large
bell, to which &s;he made &s;uch effectual application
as alarmed every &s;oul in the family. In a mo|ment
&s;he was &s;urrounded by Hatchway, Pipes,
and all the re&s;t of the &s;ervants half dre&s;&s;ed; but
&s;eeing none of the feminine gender appear, &s;he
began to &s;torm at the &s;loth and lazine&s;s of the
maids, who, &s;he ob&s;erved, ought to have been
at work an hour at lea&s;t before &s;he called;
and then, for the fir&s;t time, under&s;tood that no
woman was permitted to &s;leep within the walls.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="78">
She did not fail to exclaim again&s;t this regula|tion;
and being informed that the cook and
chambermaid lodged in a &s;mall office-hou&s;e that
&s;tood without the gate, ordered the draw-bridge
to be let down, and in per&s;on beat up their
quarters, commanding them forthwith to &s;et
about &s;couring the rooms, which had not been
hitherto kept in a very decent condition, while
two men were immediately employed to tran&s;port
the bed on which &s;he u&s;ed to lie from her bro|ther's
hou&s;e to her new habitation; &s;o that, in
le&s;s than two hours, the whole oeconomy of the
garri&s;on was turned top&s;y-turvy, and every thing
involved in &s;uch tumult and noi&s;e, that Trunnion
being di&s;turbed and di&s;tracted with the uproar,
turned out in his &s;hirt like a frantic maniac, and
arming him&s;elf with a cudgel of crab-tree, made
an irruption into his wife's apartment, where
perceiving a couple of carpenters at work, in
joining a bed&s;tead, he, with many dreadful oaths
and opprobrious invectives, ordered them to de|&s;i&s;t,
&s;wearing he would &s;uffer no bulk-heads nor
hurricane-hou&s;es to &s;tand where he was ma&s;ter:
but finding his remon&s;trances di&s;regarded by the&s;e
mechanics, who believed him to be &s;ome mad|man
belonging to the family, who had broke
from his confinement, he a&s;&s;aulted them both
with great fury and indignation, and was handled
&s;o roughly in the encounter, that in a very &s;hort
time he mea&s;ured his length on the floor, in con|&s;equence
of a blow that he received from a ham|mer,
by which the &s;ight of his remaining eye
was grievou&s;ly endangered.</P>
<P>Having thus reduced him to a &s;tate of &s;ub|jection,
they re&s;olved to &s;ecure him with cords,
and were actually bu&s;y in adju&s;ting his fetters,
<PB N="71" REF="79">
when he was exempted from the di&s;grace by
the accidental entrance of his &s;pou&s;e, who re&s;cued
him from the hands of his adver&s;aries, and, in
the mid&s;t of her condolance, imputed his misfor|tune
to the inconfiderate roughne&s;s of his own
di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>He breathed nothing but revenge, and made
&s;ome efforts to cha&s;ti&s;$ the in&s;olence of the work|men,
who, as &s;oon as they under&s;tood his qua|lity,
a&s;ked forgivene&s;s for what they had done
with great humility, prote&s;ting that they did not
know he was ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e. But, far
from being &s;atisfied with this apology, he groped
about for the bell, (the inflammation on his eye
having utterly deprived him of &s;ight) and the
rope being, by the precaution of the delinquents,
conveyed out of his reach, began to &s;torm with
incredible vociferation, like a lion roaring in the
toil, pouring forth innumerable oaths and exe|crations,
and calling by name Hatchway and
Pipes, who being within hearing, obeyed the ex|traordinary
&s;ummons, and were ordered to put
the carpenters in irons, for having audaciou&s;ly
a&s;&s;aulted him in his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>His myrmidons &s;eeing he had been evil-intreat|ed,
were exa&s;perated at the in&s;ult he had &s;uffered,
which they con&s;idered as an affront upon the dig|nity
of the garri&s;on; the more &s;o, as the muti|neers
&s;eemed to put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of
defence, and &s;et their authority at defiance: they
therefore un&s;heathed their cutla&s;&s;es, which they
commonly wore as badges of their commi&s;&s;ion;
and a de&s;perate engagement, in all probability,
would have en&s;ued, had not the lady of the ca&s;tle
interpo&s;ed, and prevented the effects of their
animo&s;ity, by a&s;&s;uring the lieutenant that the
<PB N="72" REF="80">
commodore had been the aggre&s;&s;or; and that the
workmen, finding them&s;elves attacked in &s;uch an
extraordinary manner, by a per&s;on whom they
did not know, were obliged to act in their own
defence, by which he had received that unlucky
contu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Hatchway no &s;ooner learnt the &s;enti|ments
of Mrs. Trunnion, than &s;heathing his in|dignation,
he told the commodore he &s;hould always
be ready to execute his lawful commands; but
that he could not in con&s;cience be concerned in
oppre&s;&s;ing poor people who had been guilty of no
offence.</P>
<P>This unexpected declaration, together with the
behaviour of his wife, who in his hearing de|&s;ired
the carpenters to re&s;ume their work, filled
the brea&s;t of Trunnion with rage and mortifica|tion.
He pulled off his woollen night-cap, pum|melled
his bare pate, beat the floor alternately
with his feet, &s;wore his people had betrayed him,
and cur&s;ed him&s;elf to the lowe&s;t pit of hell, for
having admitted &s;uch a cockatrice into his family.
But all the&s;e exclamations did not avail; they
were among the la&s;t e&s;&s;ays of his re&s;i&s;tance to
the will of his wife, who&s;e influence among his
adherents had already &s;wallowed up his own;
and who now peremptorily told him, that he
mu&s;t leave the management of every thing within
doors to her, who under&s;tood be&s;t what was for
his honour and advantage. She then ordered a
poultice to be prepared for his eye, which being
applied, he was committed to the care of Pipes,
by whom he was led about the hou&s;e like a blind
bear growling for prey, while his indu&s;trious
yoke-fellow executed every circum&s;tance of the
plan &s;he had projected; &s;o that, when he re|covered
<PB N="73" REF="81">
his vi&s;ion, he was an utter &s;tranger in his
own hou&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The commodore being in &s;ome ca&s;es re&s;tif, his lady
has recour&s;e to artifice in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her
throne; &s;he exhibits &s;ymptoms of pregnancy, to
the un&s;peakable joy of Trunnion, who neverthe|le&s;s
is baulked in his expectation.</HEAD>
<P>THESE innovations were not effected with|out
many loud objections on his part; and
divers curious dialogues pa&s;&s;ed between him and
his yoke-fellow, who always came off victorious
from the di&s;pute; in&s;omuch that his countenance
gradually fell; he began to &s;uppre&s;s, and at length
intirely devoured his chagrin; the terrors of &s;u|perior
authority were plainly perceivable in his
features, and in le&s;s than three months he be|came
a thorough-paced hu&s;band. Not that his
ob&s;tinacy was extingui&s;hed, tho' overcome; in
&s;ome things he was as inflexible and mulei&s;h as
ever, but then he dur&s;t not kick &s;o openly, and
was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of being pa&s;&s;ive in
his re&s;entments. Mrs. Trunnion, for example,
propo&s;ed that a coach and &s;ix &s;hould be pur|cha&s;ed,
as &s;he could not ride on hor&s;eback, and
the chai&s;e was a &s;candalous carriage for a per&s;on
of her condition; the commodore, con&s;cious of
his own inferior capacity in point of rea&s;oning,
did not think proper to di&s;pute the propo&s;al, but
lent a deaf ear to her repeated remon&s;trances,
tho' they were inforced with every argument
which &s;he thought could &s;ooth, terrify, &s;hame or
decoy him into compliance: in vain did &s;he urge
the exce&s;s of affection &s;he had for him, as me|riting
<PB N="74" REF="82">
&s;ome return of tenderne&s;s and conde&s;cen|&s;ion;
he was even proof again&s;t certain menacing
hints &s;he gave, touching the re&s;entment of a
&s;lighted woman; and he &s;tood out again&s;t all the
con&s;iderations of dignity or di&s;grace, like a bul|wark
of bra&s;s. Neither was he moved to any
indecent or unkind expre&s;&s;ions of contradiction,
even when &s;he upbraided him with his &s;ordid di&s;|po&s;ition,
and put him in mind of the fortune and
honour he had acquired by his marriage, but
&s;eemed to retire within him&s;elf, like a tortoi&s;e
when attacked, that &s;hrinks within its &s;hell, and
&s;ilently endure the &s;courge of her reproaches,
without &s;eeming &s;en&s;ible of the &s;mart.</P>
<P>This, however, was the only point in which &s;he
had been baffled &s;ince her nuptials; and as &s;he
could by no means dige&s;t the mi&s;carriage, &s;he
tortured her invention for &s;ome new plan by
which &s;he might augment her influence and au|thority:
what her genius refu&s;ed was &s;upplied
by accident; for &s;he had not lived four months in
the garri&s;on when &s;he was &s;eized with frequent
qualms and reachings, her brea&s;ts began to har|den,
and her &s;tomach to be remarkable promi|nent:
in a word, &s;he congratulated her&s;elf on
the &s;ymptoms of her own &s;ertility, and the com|modore
was tran&s;ported with joy, at the pro&s;pect
of an heir of his own begetting.</P>
<P>She knew this was the proper &s;ea&s;on for vindi|cating
her own &s;overeignty, and accordingly em|ployed
the means which nature had put in her
power. There was not a rare piece of furniture
and apparel for which &s;he did not long; and on
day as &s;he went to church, &s;eeing lady Stately
equipage arrive, &s;he &s;uddenly fainted away. Her
husband, who&s;e vanity had never been &s;o perfectly|gratified
<PB N="75" REF="83">
as with this promi&s;ed harve&s;t of his own
&s;owing, took the alarm immediately, and in or|der
to prevent relap&s;es of that kind, which might
be attended with fatal con&s;equences to his hope,
gave her leave to be&s;peak a coach, hor&s;es and li|veri$s
to her own liking. Thus authorized, &s;he
in a very little time exhibited &s;uch a &s;pecimen of
her own ta&s;te and magnificence as afforded &s;pecu|lation
to the whole county, and made Trun|nion's
heart quake within him, becau&s;e he fore|&s;aw
no limits to her extravagance, which al&s;o
manife&s;ted it&s;elf in the mo&s;t expen&s;ive prepara|tions
for her lying in.</P>
<P>Her pride, which had hitherto regarded the re|pre&s;entative
of her father's hou&s;e, &s;eemed now to
lo&s;e all that hereditary re&s;pect, and prompt her
to out&s;hine and undervalue the elder branch of
her family. She behaved to Mrs. Pickle with a
&s;ort of civil re&s;erve that implied a con&s;cious &s;u|periority,
and an emulation in point of grandeur
immediately commenced between the two &s;i&s;ters.
She every day communicated her importance to
the whole pari&s;h, under pretence of taking the air
in her coach, and endeavoured to extend her ac|quaintance
among people of fa&s;hion. Nor was
this an undertaking attended with great difficulty,
for all per&s;ons whatever, capable of maintaining
a certain appearance, will always find admi&s;&s;ion
into what is called the be&s;t company, and be
$ated in point of character according to their own
valuation, without &s;ubjecting their preten&s;ions to
the &s;malle&s;t doubt or examination. In all her vi|&s;its
and parties &s;he &s;eized every opportunity of de|claring
her pre&s;ent condition, ob&s;erving that &s;he
was forbid by her phy&s;icians to ta&s;te &s;uch a pickle,
and that &s;uch a di&s;h was poi&s;on to a woman in her
<PB N="76" REF="84">
way: nay, where &s;he was on a footing of fa|miliarity,
&s;he affected to make wry faces, and
complained that the young rogue began to be very
unruly, writhing her&s;elf into divers contortions,
as if &s;he had been grievou&s;ly incommoded by the
mettle of this future Trunnion. The hu&s;band
him&s;elf did not behave with all the moderation
that might have been expected; at the club he
frequently mention'd this circum&s;tance of his
own vigour as a pretty &s;ucce&s;sful feat to be per|formed
by an old fellow of fifty-five, and con|firmed
the opinion of his &s;trength by redoubled
&s;queezes of the landlord's hand, which never
failed of extorting a &s;atisfactory certificate of his
might. When his companions drank to the <HI>Hans
en kelderr</HI>, or Jack in the low cellar, he could
not help di&s;playing an extraordinary complacence
of countenance, and &s;ignified his intention of
&s;ending the young dog to &s;ea, as &s;oon as he &s;hould
be able to carry a cartridge, in hopes of &s;eeing
him an officer before his own death.</P>
<P>This hope helped to con&s;ole him under the ex|traordinary
expence to which he was expo&s;ed by
the profu&s;ion of his wife, e&s;pecially when he con|&s;idered
that his compliance with her prodigality
would be limited to the expiration of the nine
months, of which the be&s;t part was by this time
elap&s;ed; yet in &s;pite of all this philo&s;ophical re|&s;ignation,
her fancy &s;ometimes &s;oared to &s;uch a
ridiculous and intolerable pitch of in&s;olence and
ab&s;urdity, that his temper for&s;ook him, and he
could not help wi&s;hing in &s;ecret, that her pride
might be confounded in the di&s;&s;ipation of her mo&s;t
flattering hopes, even tho' he him&s;elf &s;hould be
a principal &s;ufferer by the di&s;appointment. The&s;e,
however, were no other than the &s;ugge&s;tions of
<PB N="77" REF="85">
temporary di&s;gu&s;ts, that commonly &s;ub&s;ided as
&s;uddenly as they aro&s;e, and never gave the lea&s;t
di&s;turbance to the per&s;on who in&s;pired them, be|cau&s;e
he took care to conceal them carefully from
her knowledge.</P>
<P>Mean while &s;he happily advanced in her reck|oning,
with the promi&s;e of a favourable i&s;&s;ue; the
term of her computation expired, and in the
middle of the night &s;he was vi&s;ited by certain
warnings that &s;eemed to be&s;peak the approach of
the critical moment. The commodore got up
with great alacrity, and called the midwife, who
had been &s;everal days in the hou&s;e; the go&s;&s;ips
were immediately &s;ummoned, and the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting
expectations prevailed; but the &s;ymp|toms
of labour gradually vani&s;hed, and, as the
matrons &s;agely ob&s;erved, this was no more than
a fal&s;e alarm.</P>
<P>Two nights after they received a &s;econd inti|mation,
and as &s;he was $$$$ibly dimini&s;hed in the
wai&s;t, every thing was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in a fair
way; yet this vi$$t$tion was not more conclu&s;ive
than the former; her pains wore off in &s;pite of
all her endeavours to encourage them, and the
good women betool them&s;elves to their re&s;pective
homes, in expectation of finding the third attack
deci&s;ive, alluding to the well-known maxim, that
<HI>number three is always fortunate.</HI> For once,
however, this apothegm $ailed; the next call was
altogether as ineffectual as the former; and
moreover, attended with a phaenomenon which
to them was equally &s;trange and inexplicable:
this was no other than &s;uch a reduction in the
&s;ize of Mrs. Trunnion as might have been ex|pected
after the birth of a full-grown child.
Startled at &s;uch an unaccountable event, they &s;at
<PB N="78" REF="86">
in clo&s;e divan; and concluding that the ca&s;e was
in all re&s;pects unnatural and prodigious, de&s;ired
that a me&s;&s;enger might be immediately di&s;patched
for &s;ome male practitioner in the art of mid|wi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The commodore, without gue&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e
of their perplexity, ordered Pipes immediately on
this piece of duty; and in le&s;s than two hours
they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the advice of a &s;urgeon of
the neighbourhood, who boldly affirmed that the
patient had never been with child. This a&s;&s;eve|$word$
was like a clap of thunder to Mr. Trun|nion,
who had been during eight whole days and
nights in continual expectation of being hailed
with the appellation of father.</P>
<P>After &s;ome recollection he &s;wore the &s;ur|geon
was an ignorant fellow, and that he would
not take his word for what he advanced, being
comforted and confirmed in his want of faith by
the in&s;inuations of the midwi&s;e, who &s;till, per|&s;i&s;ted
to feed Mrs. Trunnion with hopes of a
&s;peedy and &s;afe delivery; ob&s;erving that &s;he had
been concerned in many a ca&s;e of the &s;ame na|ture,
where a fine child was found, even after
all &s;igns of the mother's pregnancy had di&s;ap|peared.
Every twig of hope, how &s;lender &s;o|ever
it may be, is eagerly caught hold on by
people who find them&s;elves in danger of being
di&s;appointed. To every que&s;tion propo&s;ed by her
to the lady with the preamble of &startq;Han't you?&endq;
or &startq;Don't you?&endq; an an&s;wer was made in the af|firmative,
whether agreeable to truth or not, be|cau&s;e
the re&s;pondent could not find in her heart
to di&s;own any &s;ymptom that might &s;avour the
notion &s;he had &s;o long indulged.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="87">
This experienced proficient in the ob&s;tetric
art was therefore kept in clo&s;e attendance for the
&s;pace of three weeks, during which the patient
had &s;everal returns of what &s;he plea&s;ed her&s;elf
with believing to be labour-pains, till at length
&s;he and her hu&s;band became the &s;tanding joke of
the pari&s;h; and this in$atuated couple could &s;carce
be prevailed upon to part with their hopes, even
when &s;he appeared as lank as a greyhound, and
they were furni&s;hed with other unque&s;tionable
proofs of their having been deceived. But they

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mrs. Trunnion erects a tyranny in the garri&s;on,
while her husband conceives an affection for his
nephew Perry, who manife&s;ts a peculiarity of
di&s;po&s;ition even in his tender years.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING exerci&s;ed her&s;elf three months
in &s;uch pious amu&s;ements, &s;he appeared
again in the world; but her misfortune had made
&s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on her mind, that &s;he could
not bear the &s;ight of a child, and trembled when
$word$ the conver&s;ation happened to turn upon a
$word$. Her temper, which was naturally
$word$ of the &s;weete&s;t, &s;eemed to have imbibed a
$word$ proportion of &s;ouring from her di&s;ap|pointment;
of con&s;equence her company was
not much coveted, and &s;he found very few peo|ple
di&s;po&s;ed to treat her with tho&s;e marks of con|&s;ideration
which &s;he looked upon as her due.
This neglect detached her from the &s;ociety of an
unmannerly world; &s;he concentred the energy of
all her talents in the government of her own
hou&s;e, which groaned accordingly under her ar|bitrary
&s;way, and in the brandy-bottle found
ample con&s;olation for all the affliction &s;he had
undergone.</P>
<P>As for the commodore, he in a little time wea|thered
his di&s;grace, after having &s;u&s;tained many
&s;evere jokes from the lieutenant; and now his
chief aim being to be ab&s;ent from his own hou&s;e
as much as po&s;&s;ible, he frequented the publick|hou&s;e
more than ever, more a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated
the friend&s;hip of his brother-in-law Mr. Pickle,
and in the cour&s;e of their intimacy conceived an
<PB N="81" REF="89">
affection for his nephew Perry, which did not
end but with his life. Indeed it mu&s;t be owned
that Trunnion was not naturally deficient in the
&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul, which, tho' they were
&s;trangely warped, di&s;gui&s;ed and overborne by the
circum&s;tances of his boi&s;terous life and educa|tion,
did not fail to manife&s;t them&s;elves occa|&s;ionally
thro' the whole cour&s;e of his behaviour.</P>
<P>As all his hopes of propagating his own name
had peri&s;hed, and his relations lay under the in|terdiction
of his hate, it is no wonder that thro'
the familiarity and friendly intercour&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
between him and Mr. Gamaliel, he contracted a
liking for the boy, who by this time entered the
third year of his age, and was indeed a very
hand&s;ome, healthy and promi&s;ing child; and what
&s;eemed to ingratiate him &s;till more with his un|cle,
was a certain oddity of di&s;po&s;ition for which
he had been remarkable even from his cradle. It
is reported of him, that before the fir&s;t year of
his infancy was elap&s;ed, he u&s;ed very often, im|mediately
after being dre&s;&s;ed, in the mid&s;t of the
care&s;&s;es which were be&s;towed upon him by his
mother while &s;he indulged her&s;elf in the contem|plation
of her own happine&s;s, all of a &s;udden to
alarm her with a fit of &s;hrieks and cries, which
continued with great violence till he was &s;tripped
to the &s;kin with the utmo&s;t expedition by order
of his affrighted parent, who thought his tender
body was tortured by the mi&s;application of &s;ome
unlucky pin; and when he had given them all
this di&s;turbance and unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, he would
lie &s;prawling and laughing in their faces, as if
he ridiculed the impertinence of their concern.
Nay it is affirmed, that one day, when an old
woman who attended in the nur&s;ery had by
<PB N="82" REF="90">
&s;tealth conveyed a bottle of cordial waters to
her mouth, he pulled his nur&s;e by the &s;leeve,
and by a &s;light glance detecting the the&s;t,
tipt her the wink with a particular &s;lyne&s;s of
countenance, as if he had &s;aid with a &s;neer,
&startq;Ay, ay, that is what you mu&s;t all come to.&endq;
But the&s;e in&s;tances of reflection in a babe nine
months old are &s;o incredible, that I look upon
them as <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> ob&s;ervations, founded upon
imaginary recollection, when he was in a more
advanced age, and his peculiarities of temper be|came
much more remarkable: of a piece with the
ingenious di&s;coveries of tho&s;e &s;agacious ob&s;ervers,
who can di&s;cern &s;omething evidently character|i&s;tic
in the features of any noted per&s;onage who&s;e
character they have previou&s;ly heard explained;
yet, without pretending to &s;pecify at what period
of his childhood this &s;ingularity fir&s;t appeared, I
can with great truth declare, that when he fir&s;t
attracted the notice and affection of his uncle, it
was plainly perceivable.</P>
<P>One would imagine he had marked out the
commodore as a proper object of ridicule, for
almo&s;t all his little childi&s;h &s;atire was levelled
again&s;t him. I will not deny that he might have
been influenced in this particular by the example
and in&s;truction of Mr. Hatchway, who delighted
in &s;uperintending the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of his genius.
As the gout had taken up its re&s;idence in Mr.
Trunnion's great toe, from whence it never re|moved,
no not for a day, little Perry took great
plea&s;ure in treading by accident on this infirm
member; and when his uncle, incen&s;ed by the
pain u&s;ed to damn him for a hell-begotten brat,
he would appea&s;e him in a twinkling by return|ing
the cur&s;e with equal empha&s;is, and a&s;king
about was the matter with old Hannibal Tough?
<PB N="83" REF="91">
an appellation by which the lieutenant had taught
him to di&s;tingui&s;h this grim commander.</P>
<P>Neither was this the only experiment he tried
upon the patience of the commodore, with who&s;e
no&s;e he u&s;ed to take indecent freedoms even
while he was fondled on his knee; in one month
he put him to the expence of two guineas in
&s;eal-&s;kin, by picking his pocket of divers tobacco
pouches, all of which he in &s;ecret committed to
the flames. Nor did the caprice of his di&s;po|&s;ition
ab&s;tain from the favourite beverage of
Trunnion, who more than once &s;wallowed a
whole draught in which his brother's &s;nuff-box
had been emptied, before he perceived the di&s;|agreeable
infu&s;ion: and one day, when the com|modore
had cha&s;ti&s;ed him by a gentle tap with his
cane, he fell flat on the floor as if he had been
deprived of all &s;en&s;e and motion, to the terror
and amazement of the &s;triker; and after having
filled the whole hou&s;e with confu&s;ion and di&s;may,
opened his eyes and laughed heartily at the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of his own impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It would be an endle&s;s and perhaps no very
agreeable ta&s;k, to enumerate all the unlucky
$ranks he played upon his uncle and others, be|fore
he attained the fourth year of his age; about
which time he was &s;ent, with an attendant, to a
day-&s;chool in the neighbourhood, that (to u&s;e
his good mother's own expre&s;&s;ion) he might be
out of harm's way. Here, however, he made
little progre&s;s, except in mi&s;chief, which he prac|ti&s;ed
with impunity, becau&s;e the &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s
would run no ri&s;k of di&s;obliging a lad$ of for|tune,
by exerci&s;ing unnece&s;&s;ary &s;everities upon
her only child. Neverthele&s;s Mrs. Pickle was
not &s;o blindly partial as to be plea&s;ed with &s;uch
<PB N="84" REF="92">
un&s;ea&s;onable indulgence. Perry was taken out
of the hands of this courteous teacher, and com|mitted
to the in&s;truction of a pedagogue, who
was ordered to admini&s;ter &s;uch correction as the
boy &s;hould in his opinion de&s;erve. This autho|rity
he did not neglect to u&s;e; his pupil was re|gularly
flogged twice a day, and after having been
&s;ubjected to this cour&s;e of di&s;cipine for the &s;pace of
eighteen months, declared the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, dull
and untoward genius that ever had fallen under his
cultivation; in&s;tead of being reformed, he &s;eemed
rather hardened and confirmed in his vicious in|clinations,
and was dead to all &s;en&s;e of fear as
well as &s;hame. His mother was extremely mor|tified
at the&s;e &s;ymptoms of &s;tupidity, which &s;he
con&s;idered as an inheritance derived from the &s;pirit
of his father, and con&s;equently in&s;urmountable
by all the efforts of human car. But the com|modore
rejoiced over the over the ruggedne&s;s of his na|ture
and was particularly plea&s;ed when upon in|quiry
he found that Perry had beaten all the boys
in the &s;chool, a circum&s;tance from which he
progno&s;ticated every thing that was fair and for|tunate
in his future fate: ob&s;erving, that at his
age he him&s;elf was ju&s;t &s;uch another. The boy,
who was now turned of &s;ix, having profited &s;o
little under the birch of his un&s;paring governor,
Mrs. Pickle was coun&s;elled to &s;end him to a board|ing
-&s;chool not far from London, which was kept
by a certain per&s;on very eminent for his &s;ucce&s;sful
method of education. This advice &s;he the more
readily embraced, becau&s;e at that time &s;he found
her&s;elf pretty far gone with another child, that &s;he
hoped would con&s;ole her for the di&s;appointment &s;he
had met with in the unpromi&s;ing talents of Perry,
or at any rate divide her concern, &s;o as to enable
her to endure the ab&s;ence of either.</P>

<P>THE commodore under&s;tanding her deter|mination,
to which her hu&s;band did not
venture to make the lea&s;t objection, intere&s;ted
him&s;elf &s;o much in behalf of his favourite, as to
fit him out at his own charge, and accompany
him in per&s;on to the place of his de&s;tination;

him as a per&s;on of parts and integrity, received
<HI>per</HI> advance a hand&s;ome con&s;ideration for the ta&s;k
he undertook.</P>
<P>Nothing could be better judged than this piece
of liberality; the a&s;&s;i&s;tant was actually a man of
learning, probity, and good &s;en&s;e; and though
obliged by the &s;candalous admini&s;tration of for|tune
to act in the character of an inferior teacher,
had by his &s;ole capacity and application, brought
the &s;chool to that degree of reputation which it
never could have obtained from the talents of his
&s;uperior. He had e&s;tabli&s;hed an oeconomy, which
though regular, was not at all &s;evere, by enact|ing
a body of laws &s;uited to the age and compre|hen&s;ion
of every individual; and each tran&s;gre&s;&s;or
was fairly tried by his peers, and puni&s;hed accord|ing
to the verdict of the jury. No boy was
&s;courged for want of apprehen&s;ion, but a &s;pirit of
emulation was rai&s;ed by well-timed prai&s;e and art|ful
compari&s;on, and maintained by a di&s;tribution
of &s;mall prizes, which were adjudged to tho&s;e who
<PB N="86" REF="94">
&s;ignalized them&s;elves either by their indu&s;try, &s;o|briety
or genius. This tutor, who&s;e name was
Jennings, began with Perry, according to his
con&s;tant maxim, by examining the &s;oil; that is,
&s;tudying his temper, in order to con&s;ult the bia&s;s
of his di&s;po&s;ition, which was &s;trangely perverted
by the ab&s;urd di&s;cipline he had undergone. He
found him in a &s;tate of &s;ullen in&s;en&s;ibility, which
the child had gradually contracted in a long cour&s;e
of &s;tupifying correction; and at fir&s;t he was not
in the lea&s;t actuated by that commendation which
animated the re&s;t of his &s;chool-fellows; nor was
it in the power of reproach to excite his ambition,
which had been buried, as it were, in the grave
of di&s;grace: the u&s;her therefore had recour&s;e to
contemptuous neglect, with which he affected to
treat this &s;tubborn &s;pirit; fore&s;eeing that if he re|tained
any &s;eeds of &s;entiment, this weather would
infallibly rai&s;e them into vegetation: his judgement
was ju&s;tified by the event; the boy in a little time
began to make ob&s;ervations; he perceived the
marks of di&s;tinction with which virtue was re|warded,
grew a&s;hamed of the de&s;picable figure he
him&s;elf made among&s;t his companions, who far
from courting, rather &s;hunned his conver&s;ation;
and actually pined at his own want of importance.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings &s;aw and rejoiced at his mortifi|cation,
which he &s;uffered to proceed as far as po&s;|&s;ible,
without endangering his health. The child
lo&s;t all reli&s;h for diver&s;ion, loathed his food, grew
pen&s;ive, &s;olitary, and was frequently found weep|ing
by him&s;elf. The&s;e &s;ymptoms plainly evinced
the recovery of his feelings, to which his gover|nor
thought it now high time to make applica|tion;
and therefore by little and little altered his
behaviour from the indifference he had put on, to
<PB N="87" REF="95">
the appearance of more regard and attention.
This produced a favourable change in the boy,
who&s;e eyes &s;parkled with &s;atisfaction one day,
when his ma&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with a &s;hew of
&s;urprize in the&s;e words, &startq;So, Perry! I find you
don't want genius, when you think proper to u&s;e
it.&endq; Such encomiums kindled the &s;pirit of emu|lation
in his little brea&s;t; he exerted him&s;elf with
&s;urpri&s;ing alacrity, by which he &s;oon acquitted
him&s;elf of the imputation of dullne&s;s, and obtained
&s;undry honorary &s;ilver pennies, as acknowledge|ments
of his application: his &s;choolfellows now
&s;ollicited his friend&s;hip as eagerly as they had
avoided it before; and in le&s;s than a twelvemonth
after his arrival, this &s;uppo&s;ed dunce was remark|able
for the brightne&s;s of his parts; having in
that &s;hort period learnt to read Engli&s;h perfectly
well, made great progre&s;s in writing, enabled
him&s;elf to &s;peak the French language without he|&s;itation,
and acquired &s;ome knowledge in the ru|diments
of the Latin tongue. The u&s;her did not
fail to tran&s;mit an account of his proficiency to
the commodore, who received it with tran&s;port,
and forthwith communicated the happy tidings to
the parents.</P>
<P>Mr. Gamaliel Pickle, who was never &s;ubject
to violent emotions, heard them with a &s;ort of
phlegmatic &s;atisfaction that &s;carce manife&s;ted it&s;elf
either in his countenance of expre&s;&s;ions; nor did
the child's mother break forth into that rapture
and admiration which might have been expected,
when &s;he under&s;tood how much the talents of her
fir&s;t-born had exceeded the hope of her warme&s;t
magination. Not but that &s;he profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf
well plea&s;ed with Perry's reputation; though &s;he
ob&s;erved that in the&s;e commendations the truth was
<PB N="88" REF="96">
always exaggerated by &s;chool-ma&s;ters, for their own
intere&s;t; and pretended to wonder that the u&s;her
had not mingled more probability with his prai&s;e.
Trunnion was offended at her indifference and
want of faith, and believing that &s;he refined too
much in her di&s;cernment, &s;wore that Jennings
had declared the truth, and nothing but the
truth; for he him&s;elf had prophecied from the
beginning, that the boy would turn out a credit
to his family. But by this time Mrs. Pickle was
ble&s;&s;ed with a daughter, whom &s;he had brought
into the world about &s;ix months before the intel|ligence
arrived; &s;o that her care and affection be|ing
otherwi&s;e engro&s;&s;ed, the prai&s;e of Perry was
the le&s;s greedily devoured. The abatement of her
fondne&s;s was an advantage to his education, which
would have been retarded, and perhaps ruined by
pernicious indulgence and prepo&s;terous interpo&s;i|tion,
had her love con&s;idered him as an only
child; whereas her concern being now diverted
to another object that &s;hared, at lea&s;t, one half
of her affection, he was left to the management
of his preceptor, who tutored him according to
his own plan, without any lett or interruption.
Indeed all his &s;agacity and circum&s;pection were
but barely &s;ufficient to keep the young gentleman
in order; for now that he had won the palm of
victory from his rivals in point of &s;cholar&s;hip, his
ambition dilated, and he was &s;eized with the de|&s;ire
of &s;ubjecting the whole &s;chool by the valour
of his arm. Before he could bring this project to
bear, innumerable battles were fought with vari|ous
&s;ucce&s;s; every day a bloody no&s;e and com|plaint
were pre&s;ented again&s;t him, and his own
vi&s;age commonly bore &s;ome livid marks of ob&s;ti|nate
contention. At length, however, he ac|compli&s;hed
<PB N="89" REF="97">
his aim; his adver&s;aries were &s;ubdued,
his prowe&s;s acknowledged, and he obtained the
laurel in war as well as wit. Thus triumphant,
he was intoxicated with &s;ucce&s;s. His pride ro&s;e in
proportion to his power, and in &s;pite of all the
endeavours of Jennings, who practi&s;ed every me|thod
he could invent for curbing his licentious
conduct, without depre&s;&s;ing his &s;pirit, he con|tracted
a large proportion of in&s;olence, which a
&s;eries of misfortunes that happened to him in the
&s;equel could &s;carce effectually tame. Neverthe|le&s;s
there was a fund of good nature and genero|&s;ity
in his compo&s;ition; and though he e&s;tabli&s;hed
a tyranny among his comrades, the tranquility
of his reign was maintained by the love rather
than by the fear of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all this enjoyment of empire,
he never once violated that re&s;pectful awe with
which the u&s;her had found means to in&s;pire him;
but he by no means pre&s;erved the &s;ame regard for
the principal ma&s;ter, an old illiterate German
quack, who had formerly practi&s;ed corn-cutting
among the quality, and &s;old co&s;metic wa&s;hes to
the ladies, together with teeth-powders, hair|dying
liquors, prolifick elixirs, and tinctures to
&s;weeten the breath. The&s;e no&s;trums, recommended
by the art of cringing, in which he was con&s;um|mate,
ingratiated him &s;o much with people of
fa&s;hion, that he was enabled to &s;et up-&s;chool with
five and twenty boys of the be&s;t families, whom
he boarded on his own terms, and undertook to
in&s;truct in the French and Latin languages, &s;o as
to qualify them for the colleges of We&s;tmin&s;ter
or Eaton. While this plan was in its infancy,
he was &s;o fortunate as to meet with Jennings,
who for the paultry con&s;ideration of thirty pounds
<PB N="90" REF="98">
a year, which his nece&s;&s;ities compelled him to
accept, took the whole trouble of educating the
children upon him&s;elf, contrived an excellent &s;y|&s;tem
for that purpo&s;e, and by his a&s;&s;iduity and
knowledge executed all the particulars to the en|tire
&s;atisfaction of tho&s;e concerned, who by the
bye, never inquired into his qualifications, but
&s;uffered the other to enjoy the fruits of his labour
and ingenuity.</P>
<P>Over and above a large &s;tock of avarice, ig|norance
and vanity, this &s;uperior had certain ridi|culous
peculiarities in his per&s;on, &s;uch as a hunch
upon his back, and di&s;torted limbs, that &s;eemed
to attract the &s;atirical notice of Peregrine, who,
young as he was, took offence at his want of re|verence
for his u&s;her, over whom he &s;ometimes
cho&s;e opportunities of di&s;playing his authority,
that the boys might not mi&s;place their venera|tion.
Mr. Keyp&s;tick, therefore, &s;uch as I have

of this enterpri&s;ing pupil, who now being

dimen&s;ions of nature; with this view he wore
&s;hoes with heels three inches high, &s;trutted like
a peacock in walking, and erected his head with
&s;uch mu&s;cular exertion, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible
for him to extend his vi&s;ion downwards blow the
preternatural prominence of his brea&s;t. Peregrine,
therefore, taking advantage of this foppery, u&s;ed
to &s;trew his way with bean-&s;hells, on which
whenever he chanced to tread, his heels &s;lipped
<PB N="92" REF="100">
from under him, his hunch pitched upon the
ground, and the furniture of his head fell off in
the &s;hock; &s;o that he lay in a very ludicrous atti|tude
for the entertainment of the &s;pectators. He
moreover &s;eized opportunities of &s;tudding his
breeches with large pins, which when he &s;at down
with a &s;udden jirk, penetrated the &s;kin of his po|&s;teriors,
and compelled him to &s;tart up again with
infinite expedition, and roar hideou&s;ly with the
pain. Nay, perceiving that he was extremely pe|nurious
in his hou&s;e-keeping, he &s;poilt many a
pot of excellent &s;oup maigre, by &s;lily conveying
into it handfuls of &s;alt or &s;oot, and even drove
needles into the heads of &s;undry fowls, that from
the &s;uddenne&s;s of their death he might conclude
some infection was communicated to his poultry,
and di&s;po&s;e of them accordingly for the half of their
value. But no in&s;tance of young Pickle's mi&s;chievous
talents affected him with &s;uch immediate perplexity
and confu&s;ion as this that I am going to recount.</P>
<P>Being apprized by one of his friends that a lady
of fa&s;hion intended to vi&s;it his &s;chool on a certain
day, without giving any previous notice of her
coming, that &s;he might be an eye-witne&s;s of the
accommodation in his hou&s;e before &s;he would
commit her &s;on to his care, he ordered his
boarders and apartments to be di&s;hed out for the
occa&s;ion, &s;pared no pains in adorning his own
per&s;on, and in particular employed a whole hour
in adju&s;ting a voluminous tye, in which he pro|po&s;ed
to make his appearance. Thus prepared,
he waited with great confidence and tranquillity,
and no &s;ooner &s;aw the coach appear at a di&s;tance,
than he went to his clo&s;et in order to put on the
periwig, which he had depo&s;ited in a box, that no
accident might ruffle or di&s;compo&s;e it before it
was pre&s;ented to her lady&s;hip; but neither the
<PB N="93" REF="101">
box nor its contents were to be found. At fir&s;t
he thought it might be mi&s;placed by &s;ome of the
&s;ervants, to whom he called with great eagerne&s;s
and vociferation, while he him&s;elf ran from room
to room in que&s;t of what he wanted: the dome&s;|ticks
could give him no intelligence of his tye;
he heard the gates opened to admit the equipage,
his impatience increa&s;ed, he &s;wore in high Dutch,
the noi&s;e of the wheels on his pavement &s;aluted
his ears, his vexation redoubled, and to&s;&s;ing his
night-cap on the floor, he waddled down &s;tairs
to the hall for his ordinary periwig, which he now
found him&s;elf compelled to wear. How &s;hall I
de&s;cribe his di&s;straction when he under&s;tood that
too was mi&s;&s;ing! he became quite delirious,
foamed at the mouth, danced to and fro in the
pa&s;&s;age like one bere&s;t of his &s;en&s;es, bla&s;phemed
alternately in Engli&s;h and French, and mu&s;t have
been found by the lady in that frantic condition,
had not his &s;ervants conveyed him to his own
chamber by force.</P>
<P>The noble vi&s;itant was received by Jennings,
who told her that Mr. Keyp&s;tick was confined
to his bed, and explained the whole oeconomy of
the &s;chool &s;o much to her &s;atisfaction, that &s;he
re&s;olved to honour them with the charge of her
own offspring. Keyp&s;tick fell &s;ick in good earne&s;t,
and his intellects &s;eemed to have received a rude
&s;hock from the violence of the pa&s;&s;ion into which
he had been precipitated by the roguery of Pere|grine,
who had concealed both periwigs in the
cellar, and now having enjoyed his trick, car|ried
them back unperceived to the places from
which they had been removed.</P>
<P>A whole week elap&s;ed before the ma&s;ter reco|vered
&s;o much temper as to appear decently in pub|lic;
<PB N="94" REF="102">
and even then his countenance, was &s;tormy,
and his re&s;entment again&s;t the authors of his di&s;|grace
&s;o inten&s;e, that he promi&s;ed a reward of
five guineas to any boy that would di&s;cover the
principal actor, or any of the accomplices con|cerned
in this audacious intrigue; declaring that
no con&s;ideration &s;hould &s;creen the offenders form
condign puni&s;hment, could they once be con|victed
of the trick.</P>
<P>Pickle had not conducted this <HI>Jeu d'e&s;prit</HI>
without participation, and &s;ome there were privy
to the affair who&s;e fidelity was not incorruptible;
but their &s;ecrecy was &s;ecured by the terror of Pe|regrine,
who&s;e authority and influence was &s;uch
as to baffle the ma&s;ter in all his endeavours to un|ravel
the con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>This extraordinary re&s;erve, and the recollec|tion
of &s;everal other mortifying jokes he had
undergone, in&s;pired him with ungenerous &s;u&s;pi|cions
of Mr. Jennings, who he could not help
thinking had been at the bottom of them all, and
&s;pirited up principles of rebellion in the &s;chool,
with a view of making him&s;elf independent. Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
with this chimera, which was void of all foun|dation,
the German de&s;cended &s;o low as to tam|per
in private with the boys, from whom he hoped
to draw &s;ome very important di&s;covery; but he
was di&s;appointed in his expectation; and this
mean practice reaching the ears of his u&s;her, he
vol$ntarily re&s;igned his employment, and finding
intere&s;t to obtain holy orders in a little time after,
left the kingdom, hoping to find a &s;ettlement in
&s;ome of our American plantations.</P>
<P>The departure of Mr. Jennings produced a
great revolution in the affairs of Keyp&s;tick, which
declined from that moment, becau&s;e he had neither
<PB N="95" REF="103">
authority to enforce obedience, nor prudence to
maintain order among his &s;cholars; &s;o that the
&s;chool degenerated into anarchy and con$u&s;ion,
and he him&s;elf dwindled in the opinion of his
imployers, who looked upon him as &s;uperannu|ated.
and withdrew their children from his tui|tion.</P>
<P>Peregrine &s;eeing this di&s;&s;olution of their &s;ociety,
and finding him&s;elf every day deprived of &s;ome
companion, began to repine at his &s;ituation, and
re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to procure his relea&s;e from
the juri&s;diction of a per&s;on whom he both dete&s;ted
and de&s;pi&s;ed. With this view he went to work,
and compo&s;ed the following billet, addre&s;&s;ed to
the commodore, which was the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of
his compo&s;ition in the epi&s;tolary way.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured and loving uncle,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOping you are in good health, this &s;erves
to inform you, that Mr. Jennings is
gone, and Mr. Keyp&s;tick will never meet with
his fellow. The &s;chool is already almo&s;t broke
up, and the re&s;t daily going away; and I beg of
you of all love to have me fetched away al&s;o, for
I cannot bear to be any longer under one who is
a perfect ignoramus, who &s;carce knows the decli|nation
of <HI>mu&s;a,</HI> and is more fit to be a &s;care-crow
than a &s;choolma&s;ter; hoping you will &s;end for

<P><PB N="96" REF="104">
Trunnion was overjoyed at the receit of this
letter, which he looked upon as one of the greate&s;t
efforts of human genius, and as &s;uch communi|cated
the contents to his lady, whom he had di&s;|turbed
for the purpo&s;e in the middle of her devo|tion,
by &s;ending a me&s;&s;age to her clo&s;et, whither
it was her cu&s;tom very frequently to retire. She
was out of humour at being interrupted, and
therefore did not peru&s;e this &s;pecimen of her ne|phew's
under&s;tanding with all the reli&s;h that the
commodore him&s;elf had enjoyed; on the con|trary,
after &s;undry paralytical endeavours to &s;peak,
(for her tongue &s;ometimes refu&s;ed its office) &s;he
ob&s;erved that the boy was a pert jackanapes, and
de&s;erved to be &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed for treating his
betters with &s;uch di&s;re&s;pect. Her hu&s;band under|took
his god&s;on's defence, repre&s;enting with great
warmth that he knew Keyp&s;tick to be a good for
nothing pimping old ra&s;cal, and that Perry &s;hewed
a great deal of &s;pirit and good &s;en&s;e in de&s;iring to
be taken from under his command; he therefore
declared that the boy &s;hould not live a week
longer with &s;uch a &s;hambling &s;on of a bitch, and
&s;anctioned his declaration with abundance of
oaths.</P>
<P>Mrs. Trunnion compo&s;ing her countenance
into a look of religious demurene&s;s, rebuked him
for his profane way of talking, and a&s;ked in a
magi&s;terial tone if he intended never to lay a&s;ide
that brutal behaviour? Irritated at this reproach,
he an&s;wered in terms of indignation, that he knew
how to behave him&s;elf as well as e'er a woman
that wore a head, bad her mind her own affairs,
and with another repetition of oaths gave her to
under&s;tand that he would be ma&s;ter in his own
hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="105">
This in&s;inuation operated upon her &s;pirits like
friction upon a gla&s;s globe, her face gleamed with
re&s;entment, and every pore &s;eemed to emit par|ticles
of flame. She replied with incredible fluency
of the bittere&s;t expre&s;&s;ions. He retorted equal
rage in broken hints and incoherent imprecations.
She rejoined with redoubled fury, and in conclu|&s;ion
he was fain to betake him&s;elf to flight, eja|culating
cur&s;es again&s;t her; and muttering &s;ome|thing
concerning the brandy-bottle, which, how|ever,
he took care &s;hould never reach her ears.</P>
<P>From his own hou&s;e he went directly to vi&s;it Mrs.
Pickle, to whom he imparted Peregrine's epi&s;tle
with many encomiums upon the boy's promi&s;ing
parts; and finding his commendations but coldly
received, de&s;ired &s;he would permit him to take
his god&s;on under his own care.</P>
<P>This lady, who&s;e family was now increa&s;ed by
another &s;on that &s;eemed to engro&s;s her care for
the pre&s;ent, had not &s;een Perry during a cour&s;e
of four years, and with regard to him, was per|fectly
weaned of that infirmity known by the
name of maternal fondne&s;s; &s;he therefore con|&s;ented
to the commodore's reque&s;t with great con|de&s;cen&s;ion,
and a polite compliment to him on
the concern he had all along manife&s;ted for the
welfare of the child.</P>

<P>TRunnion having obtained this permi&s;&s;ion
that very afternoon, di&s;patched the lieute|nant
in a po&s;t chai&s;e to Keyp&s;tick's hou&s;e, from
whence in two days he returned with our young
hero; who being now in the eleventh year of his
age, had outgrown the expectation of all his fa|mily,
and was remarkable for the beauty and ele|gance
of his per&s;on. His godfather was tran&s;|ported
at his arrival, as if he had been actually
the i&s;&s;ue of his own loins. He &s;hook him heartily
by the hand, turned him round and round, &s;ur|veyed
him from top to bottom, bad Hatchway
take notice how hand&s;omely he was built;
&s;queezed his hand again, &s;aying, &startq;Damn ye, you
dog, I &s;uppo&s;e you don't value &s;uch an old crazy
&s;on of a bitch as me, a rope's end. You have for|got
how I wont to dandle you on my knee, when
you was a little urchin no higher than the David,
and played a thou&s;and tricks upon me, burning
my bacco-pouches and poi&s;oning my rumbo: O!
damn ye, you can grin fa&s;t enough I &s;ee; I war|rant
you have learnt more things than writing
and the Latin lingo.&endq; Even Tom Pipes expre&s;&s;ed
uncommon &s;atisfaction on this joyful occa&s;ion;
and coming up to Perry, thru&s;t forth his fore|paw,
and acco&s;ted him with the &s;alutation of
&startq;What chear, my young ma&s;ter? I am glad &s;ee
<PB N="99" REF="107">
thee with all my heart.&endq; The&s;e compliments be|ing
pa&s;&s;ed, his uncle halted to the door of his
wife's chamber, at which he &s;tood hollowing,
&startq;Here's your kin&s;man Perry, belike you won't
come and bid him welcome.&endq; &startq;Lord! Mr.
Trunnion, &s;aid &s;he, why will you continually har|ra&s;s
me in this manner with your impertinent in|tru&s;ion?&endq;
&startq;I harrow you, replied the commodore,
'&s;blood! I believe your upper works are damaged.
I only came to inform you that here was your
cou&s;in, whom you have not &s;een the&s;e four long
years; and I'll be damned if there is &s;uch another
of his age within the king's dominions, d'ye &s;ee,
either for make or mettle; he's a credit to the
name, d'ye &s;ee, but damn my eyes I'll &s;ay no
more of the matter; if you come you may, if
you won't you may let it alone.&endq; &startq;Well, I
won't come then (an&s;wered his yoke-fellow) for
I am at pre&s;ent more agreeably employed.&endq;
&startq;Oho! you are? I believe &s;o too;&endq; cried the
commodore, making wry faces and mimicking
the action of dram-drinking. Then addre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf to Hatchway, &startq;Prithee Jack, &s;aid he,
go and try thy &s;kill on that &s;tubborn hulk; if any
body can bring her about I know you wool.&endq;
The lieutenant accordingly taking his &s;tation at
the door, conveyed his per&s;wa&s;ion in the&s;e words.
&startq;What won't you turn out and hail little Perry?
It will do your heart good to &s;ee &s;uch a hand&s;ome
young dog; I'm &s;ure he is the very moral of you,
and as like as if he had been &s;pit out of your
own mouth, as the &s;aying is; do &s;hew a little
re&s;pect for your kin&s;man, can't you.&endq; To this
rem$n&s;trance &s;he replied in a mild tone of voice,
&startq;Dear Mr. Hatchway, you are always teazing
one in &s;uch a manner; &s;ure I am, no body can
<PB N="100" REF="108">
tax me with unkindne&s;s, or want of natural af|fection;&endq;
&s;o &s;aying, &s;he opened the d$or, and
advancing to the hall where her nephew &s;tood, re|ceived
him very graciou&s;ly, and ob&s;erved that he
was the very image of her papa.</P>
<P>In the afternoon he was conducted by the com|modore
to the hou&s;e of his parents; and &s;trange
to tell, no &s;ooner was he pre&s;ented to his mother
than her countenance changed, &s;he eyed him with
tokens of affliction and &s;urprize, and bur&s;ting
into tears, exclaimed her child was dead, and this
was no other than an impo&s;tor whom they had
brought to de&s;raud her &s;orrow. Trunnion was
confounded at this unaccountable pa&s;&s;ion, which
had no other foundation than caprice and whim;
and Gamaliel him&s;elf &s;o di&s;concerted and un&s;ettled
in his own belief, which began to waver, that he
knew not how to behave towards the boy, whom
his godfather immediately carried back to the
garri&s;on, &s;wearing all the way that Perry &s;hould
never cro&s;s their thre&s;hold again with his good|will.
Nay, &s;o much was he incen&s;ed at this un|natural
and ab&s;urd renunciation, that he refu&s;ed
to carry on any further corre&s;pondence with
Pickle, until he was appea&s;ed by his &s;ollici$ations
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and Peregrine owned as his &s;on
and heir. But this acknowledgment was made
without the privity of his wife, who&s;e vicious
aver&s;ion he was obliged, in appearance, to adopt.
Thus exiled from his father's hou&s;e, the young
gentleman was left entirely to the di&s;po&s;al of the
commodore, who&s;e affection for him daily in|crea&s;ed,
in&s;omuch, that he could &s;carce prevail
upon him&s;elf to part with him, when his educa|tion
ab&s;olutely required that he &s;hould be other|wi&s;e
di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="109">
In all probability, this extraordinary attach|ment
was, if not produced, at lea&s;t rivetted by
that peculiar turn in Peregrine's imagination,
which we have already ob&s;erved; and which,
during his re&s;idence in the ca&s;tle, appeared in
&s;undry &s;tratagems he practi&s;ed upon his uncle and
aunt, under the au&s;pices of Mr. Hatchway, who
a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the contrivance and execution of
all his &s;chemes. Nor was Pipes exempted from
a &s;$are in their undertakings for, being a tru&s;ty
fellow, not without dexterity in &s;ome ca&s;es, and
altogether re&s;igned to their will, they found him
a &s;erviceable in&s;trument for their purpo&s;e, and
u&s;ed him accordingly.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ample of their art was exhibited upon
Mrs. Trunnion, from who&s;e chamber Peregrine
having &s;ecreted a cetain uten&s;il, divers holes were
drilled through the bottom of it by their operator;
and then it was replaced in a curious ca&s;e that
&s;tood by the bed-&s;ide, in which it was re&s;erved
for midnight-occa&s;ions. The good lady had that
evening made &s;everal extraordinary vi&s;its to her
clo&s;et, and that &s;ort of exerci&s;e never failed of
having a diuretic effect uponher con&s;titution; &s;o
that &s;he and her hu&s;band were &s;carce warm
in bed, when &s;he found it convenient to reach
out her hand, and introduce this receptacle under
the cloaths. It was then that Peregrine's roguery
took effect. The commodore, who had ju&s;t
compo&s;ed him&s;elf to re&s;t, was in&s;tantly alarmed
with a &s;trange &s;en&s;ation in his right &s;houlder, on
which &s;omething warm &s;eemed to de&s;cend in va|rious
&s;treams: he no &s;ooner comprehended the
nature of this &s;hower, which in a twinkling be|dewed
him from head to foot, than he exclaimed,
&startq;Blood and oons! I'm afloat?&endq; and &s;tarting
<PB N="102" REF="110">
up, a&s;ked with great bitterne&s;s if &s;he had pi&s;&s;ed
through a watering can. Equally &s;urprized and of|fended
at the indecent que&s;tion, &s;he began to re|gale
him with a lecture on the &s;ubject of that re|&s;pect
in which &s;he thought him &s;o deficient; but
perceiving the &s;ource of his di&s;plea&s;ure, was &s;ilenc|ed
in the middle of the fir&s;t &s;entence; and after
a &s;hort pau&s;e of a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;creamed with vex|ation.</P>
<P>As there was a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;hifting the bed|linnen,
&s;he got up with great reluctance, rung
her bell, and when her mad entered, pre&s;ented
this new fa&s;hioned cullender, and threatened with
many choleric expre&s;&s;ions to &s;plit it into a thou|&s;and
pieces on her &s;kull. Thunder&s;truck at the
phaenomenon, it was &s;ome time beore the atten|dant
could open her lips in her own vindication;
at length, however, &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he was inno|cent
as the babe unborn, and that the pot was
found and intire when &s;he rin&s;ed it in the after|noon.</P>
<P>Her &s;u&s;picion was of con&s;equence transferred
upon Perry, again&s;t whom &s;he uttered many me|nacing
invectives; though &s;he was afterwards
a&s;hamed of di&s;clo&s;ing her re&s;entment, and in the
mean time was fain to take up her night's
lodging in another apartment; while Trunnion,
after a &s;tring of unmeaning oaths, which were
extorted from him by his pre&s;ent uncomfortable
&s;ituation, could not help laughing at the adven|ture;
and Peregrine with his confederates, ap|plauded
them&s;elves in &s;ecret for having reduced
them to &s;uch ridiculous di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the impunity with which they
performed this feat, our a&s;&s;ociates atchieved ano|ther,
that had like to have been attended with
<PB N="103" REF="111">
very &s;erious con&s;equences. Mrs. Trunnion hav|ing
one day received a &s;udden call which &s;he
could not help obeying, her nephew, who was
always on the &s;cout, took that opportunity of
gliding un&s;een into her clo&s;et, and finding her
ca&s;e open, infu&s;ed into one of the bottles a good
quantity of powdered jallap, which had been pur|cha&s;ed
by the lieutenant for that purpo&s;e. He had
de&s;ired the apothecary from whom he bought it,
to give him as much as would impregnate two
quarts of brandy, which, he gue&s;&s;ed, each bottle
might contain; and never dreamed that the pa|tient,
though left to her own di&s;cretion, was in
any danger of taking an over-do&s;e; he therefore
directed Perry to convey the whole proportion
into one of the full bottles that &s;tood at &s;ome di|&s;tance
from that which he would perceive wa$ in
pre&s;ent u&s;e, that the &s;pirits might have time to
extract the virtues of the root before it &s;hould
come to their turn. Every thing was done ac|cording
to his pre&s;cription, and a very &s;mall hole
being bored in the wain&s;cot, through which they
could reconnoitre her from another room; they
ob&s;erved her motions by turns, with a view of
seeing whether or not &s;he would be alarmed by
the extraordinary ta&s;te of the tincture they had
made.</P>
<P>When they had watched in this manner for
three or four days, Pipes being upon duty, per|ceived
her take the fir&s;t cup of the compo&s;ition,
which &s;he had no &s;ooner &s;wallowed, than &s;he be|gan
to &s;hut her eyes, &s;mack her lips, &s;pit and
expre&s;s all the marks of loathing and di&s;gu&s;t: ne|verthele&s;s
&s;he &s;eemed to doubt her own &s;en&s;e,
rather than the flavour of the Coniac, the neat|ne&s;s
of which &s;he had already experienced, and

her own di&s;ta&s;te; taking care, however, to arm
her palate with a large lump of &s;ugar, through

<P>Hatchway was &s;tartled when he under&s;tood &s;he
had taken &s;uch a dangerous draught of the medi|cine,
e&s;pecially as &s;he had immediately after &s;tep|ped
into the coach to go to church, where he
feared &s;he might catch cold, or be otherwi&s;e af|fected,
to the jeopardy of her per&s;on and the pre|judice
of her reputation. Nor was his fear alto|gether
di&s;appointed. The &s;ervice was not half
performed, when Mrs. Trunnion was &s;uddenly
$aken ill; her face underwent violent flu&s;hings
and vici&s;&s;itudes of complexion; a cold clammy
&s;weat bedewed her forehead, and her bowels were
afflicted with &s;uch agonies, as compelled her to
retire in the face of the congregation. She was
brougt home in torture, which was a little a&s;|&s;uaged
when the do&s;e began to operate; but &s;uch
was the exce&s;s of evacuation &s;he &s;u&s;tained, that
her &s;pirits were quite exhau&s;ted, and &s;he &s;uffered
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fainting fits that reduced her to
the brink of the grave, in &s;pite of all the reme|dies
that were admini&s;tered by a phy&s;ician who
was called in the beginning of her di&s;order, and
who, after having examined the &s;ymptoms, de|clared
that the patient had been poi&s;oned with
ar&s;enic, and pre&s;cribed oily draughts and lubri|cating
injections to defend the coats of the &s;to|mach

of that pernicious mineral; at the &s;ame time hint|ing,
with a look of infinite &s;agacity, that it was
not difficult to divine the whole my&s;tery; and

whom the officious &s;on of Ae&s;culapius
&s;u&s;pected as the author of this expedient, to rid
his hands of a yoke-fellow, for whom he was
well known to have no great devotion. This
impertinent and malicious in&s;inuation made &s;ome
impre&s;&s;ion upon the by-&s;tanders, and fur|ni&s;hed
ample field for &s;lander, to a&s;per&s;e the mo|rals
of Trunnion, who was repre&s;ented through
the whole di&s;trict as a mon&s;ter of barbarity.
Nay, the &s;ufferer her&s;elf, though &s;he behaved
with great decency and prudence, could not help
entertaining &s;ome &s;mall diffidence of her hu&s;band:
not that &s;he imagined he had any de&s;ign upon her
life, but that he had been at pains to adulterate
the brandy, with the view of detaching her from
that favourite liquor.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The triumvirate turn the &s;tream of their wit upon
the commodore, who by their means is embroiled
with an attorney, and terrified with an appari|tion.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;hafts of their wit were now directed
again&s;t the commander him&s;elf, whom
they teized and terrified almo&s;t out of his &s;en&s;es.
One day while he was at dinner, Pipes came and
told him that there was a per&s;on below that
wanted to &s;peak with him immediately about an
affair of the greate&s;t importance, that would admit
of no delay; upon which he ordered the &s;tranger
to be told that he was engaged, and that he mu&s;t
&s;end up his name and bu&s;ine&s;s. To this demand
he received for an&s;wer a me&s;&s;age, importing that
the per&s;on's name was unknown to him, and his
bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch a nature, that it could not be di&s;|clo&s;ed
to any one but the commodore him&s;elf,
whom he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ee without lo&s;s of
time.</P>
<P>Trunnion, &s;urpri&s;ed at this importunity, got
up with great reluctance in the middle of his
meal, and de&s;cending to a parlour where the
$span$, was a&s;ked in a &s;urly tone what he wanted
with him in &s;uch a damned hurry, that he could
not wait till he had made an end of his me&s;s.
The other, not at all di&s;concerted at this rough
addre&s;s, advanced clo&s;e up to him on his tiptoes,
and with a look of confidence and conceit, laying
his mouth to one &s;ide of the commodore's head,
whi&s;pered &s;o$tly in his ear, &startq;Sir, I am the attor|ney
whom you wanted to conver&s;e with in pri|vate.&endq;
<PB N="107" REF="115">
&startq;The attorney!&endq; cried Trunnion, &s;tare|ing

at your &s;ervice, replied this retainer to the law,
and if you plea&s;e, the &s;ooner we di&s;patch the affair
the better; for 'tis an old ob&s;ervation, that delay
breeds danger.&endq; &startq;Truly, brother, &s;aid the com|modore,
who could no longer contain him&s;elf,
I do confe&s;s that I am very much of your way of
thinking, d'ye &s;ee; and therefore you &s;hall be
di&s;patched in a trice;&endq; &s;o &s;aying, he lifted up his
walking &s;taff, which was &s;omething between a
crutch and a cudgel, and di&s;charged it with &s;uch
energy on the &s;eat of the attorney's under&s;tand|ing,
that if there had been any thing but &s;olid
bone, the contents of his &s;kull mu&s;t have been
evacuated.</P>
<P>Fortified as he was by nature again&s;t all &s;uch
a&s;&s;aults, he could not with&s;tand the momentum
of the blow, which in an in&s;tant laid him flat on
the floor, deprived of all &s;en&s;e and motion; and
Trunnion hopped up &s;tairs to dinner, applauding
him&s;elf in ejaculations all the way for the ven|geance
he had taken on &s;uch an impudent petti|fogging
mi&s;creant.</P>
<P>The attorney no &s;ooner awaked from this
tr$nce, into which he had been &s;o unexpectedly
lulled, than he ca&s;t his eyes around in que&s;t of
evidence, by which he might be enabled the more
ea&s;ily to prove the injury he had &s;u&s;tained; but
not a &s;oul appearing, he made &s;hift to get upon
his legs again, and with the blood trickling over
his no&s;e, followed one of the &s;ervants into the
dining-room, re&s;olved to come to an explanation
with the a&s;&s;ailant, and either extort money from
him by way of &s;atisfaction, or provoke him to a
&s;econd application before witne&s;&s;es. With this

<P>The one-eyed commander who had been &s;atis|fied
with the cha&s;ti&s;ement he had already be|&s;towed
upon the plaintiff, hearing him read this
audacious piece of forgery, which he con&s;idered
as the effect of his won villany, &s;tarted up from
table, and &s;eizing a huge turkey that lay in a di&s;h
<PB N="109" REF="117">
before him, would have applied it &s;auce and all by
way of poultice to his wound, had he not been
re&s;trained by Hatchway, who laid fa&s;t hold on
both his arms, and fixed him to his chair again,
advi&s;ing the attorney to &s;heer off with what he
had got. Far from following this &s;alutary coun&s;el,
he redoubled his threats, and &s;et Trunnion at de|fiance,
telling him he was not a man of true
courage, although he had commanded a &s;hip of
war, or el&s;e he would not have attacked any
per&s;on in &s;uch a cowardly and clande&s;tine man|ner.
This provocation would have an&s;wered his
purpo&s;e effectually, had not his adver&s;ary's in|dignation
been repre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ugge&s;tions of the
lieutenant who de&s;ired his friend in a whi&s;per to
be ea&s;y, for he would take care to have the attor|ney
to&s;&s;ed in a blanket for his pre&s;umption. This
propo&s;al, which he received with great approba|tion,
pacified him in a moment; he wiped the
&s;weat from his forehead, and his features relaxed
into a grim &s;mile.</P>
<P>Hatchway di&s;appeared, and Ravine proceeded
with great fluency of abu&s;e, until he was interrupt|ed
by the arrival of Pipes, who, without any expo&s;|tulation,
led him out by the hand, and conducted
him to the yard, where he was put into a carpet,
and in a twinkling &s;ent into the air by the &s;trength
and dexterity of five &s;tout operators, whom the
lieutenant had &s;elected from the number of do|me&s;ticks
for that &s;ingular &s;pell of duty.</P>
<P>In vain did the a&s;toni&s;hed vaulter beg for the
love of God and pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, that they would
take pity upon him, and put an end to his in|voluntary
gambols; they were deaf to his prayers
and prote&s;tations, even when he &s;wore in the
mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that if they would cea&s;e tor|menting
<PB N="110" REF="118">
him, he would forget and forgive what
was pa&s;&s;ed, and depart in peace to his own habi|tation;
and continued the game till they were
fatigued with the exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Ravine being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in a mo&s;t melancholy
plight, brought an action of a&s;&s;ault and battery
again&s;t the commodore, and &s;ubpoena'd all the
&s;ervants as evidences in the cau&s;e; but as none of
them had &s;een what happened, he did not find his
account in the pro&s;ecution, though he him&s;elf
examined all the witne&s;&s;es, and among other
que&s;tions, a&s;ked whether they had not &s;een him
come in like another man? and whether they had
ever &s;een any other man in &s;uch a condition as
that in which he had crawled off? But this la&s;t
interrogation they were not obliged to an&s;wer,
becau&s;e it had reference to the &s;econd di&s;cipline he
had undergone, in which they, and they only
were concerned; and no per&s;on is bound to give
te&s;timoney again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the attorney was non&s;uited, to the
&s;atisfaction of all who knew him, and found him|&s;elf
under the nece&s;&s;ity of proving that he had re|ceived
in cour&s;e of po&s;t, the letter which was de|clared
in court a &s;candalous forgery, in order to
prevent an indictment with which he was threat|ened
by the commodore, who little dreamt that
the whole affair had been planned and executed
by Peregrine and his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>The next enterprize in which this triumvirate
engaged, was a &s;cheme to frighten Trunnion
with an apparition, which they prepared and ex|hibited
in this manner. To the hide of a large
ox Pipes fitted a leathern vizor of a mo&s;t terrible
appearance, &s;tretched on the jaws of a &s;hark
which he had brought from &s;ea, and accommo|dated
<PB N="111" REF="119">
with a couple of broad gla&s;&s;es in&s;tead of eyes.
On the in&s;ide of the&s;e he placed two ru&s;h lights,
and with a compo&s;ition of &s;ulphur and &s;alt-petre,
made a pretty large fu&s;e, which he fixed between
two rows of the teeth. This equipage being fini&s;hed,
he, one dark night cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e, put it
on, and following the commodore into a long
pa&s;&s;age in which he was preceded by Perry with
a light in his hand, kindled his fire-work with a
match, and began to bellow like a bull. The boy,
as it was concerted, looking behind him, &s;creamed
aloud, and dropped the light, which was extin|gui&s;hed
in the fall: when Trunnion alarmed at
his nephew's con&s;ternation, exclaimed, &startq;Zounds!
what's the matter?&endq; And turning about to &s;ee
the cau&s;e of his di&s;may, beheld a hideous phan|tom
vomiting blue flame, which aggravated the
horrors of its a&s;pect. He was in&s;tantly &s;eized with
an agony of fear, which dive&s;ted him of his rea|&s;on;
neverthele&s;s, he, as it were mechanically,
rai&s;ed his tru&s;ty &s;upporter in his own defence, and
the apparition advancing towards him, aimed it
at this dreadful annoyance with &s;uch a convul&s;ive
exertion of &s;trength, that had not the blow
chanced to light upon one of the horns, Mr. Pipes
would have had no cau&s;e to value him&s;elf upon
his invention. Mi&s;app$ied as it was, he did not
$ail to &s;tagger at the &s;hock, and dreading another
&s;uch &s;alutation, clo&s;ed with the commodore, and
having tripped up his heels, retreated with great
expedition.</P>
<P>It was then that Peregrine, pretending to re|collect
him&s;elf a little, run with all the marks
of di&s;turbance and affright, and called up the
&s;ervants to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their ma&s;ter, whom
they found in a cold &s;weat-upon the floor, his
<PB N="112" REF="120">
features betokening horror and confu&s;ion. Hatch|way
rai&s;ed him up, and having comforted him
with a cup of Nantz, began to inquire into the
cau&s;e of his di&s;order: but he could not extract
one word of an&s;wer from his friend, who, after
a con&s;iderable pau&s;e, during which he &s;eemed to
be wrapped up in profound contemplation, pro|nounced
aloud, &startq;By the Lord! Jack, you
may &s;ay what you wool; but I'll be damned if
it was not Davy Jones him&s;elf: I know him by
his &s;aucer-eyes, his three rows of teeth, his horns
and tail, and the blue &s;moak that came out of
his no&s;trils. What does the black-guard, hell's
baby want with me? I'm &s;ure I never committed
murder, nor wronged any man what&s;omever,
&s;ince I fir&s;t went to &s;ea.&endq; This &s;ame Davy
Jones, according to the mythology of &s;ailors, is
the fiend that pre&s;ides over all the evil &s;pirits of
the deep, and is often &s;een in various &s;hapes,
perching among the rigging on the eve of hur|ricanes,
&s;hipwrecks, and other di&s;a&s;ters, to which
a &s;ea-faring life is expo&s;ed; <HI>warning the devoted
wretch of death and woe.</HI> No wonder then that
Trunnion was di&s;turbed by a &s;uppo&s;ed vi&s;it of
this daemon, which, in his opinion, foreboded
&s;ome dreadful calamity.</P>

it is our confederates entertained &s;uch a large
proportion of it, that not &s;atisfied with the
pranks they had already played, they &s;till per&s;e|cuted
the commodore without cea&s;ing. In the
cour&s;e of his own hi&s;tory, the particulars of
which he delighted to recount, he had often re|hear&s;ed
an adventure of deer-&s;tealing, in which
(during the unthinking impetuo&s;ity of his youth)
he had been unfortunately concerned. Far from
&s;ucceeding in that atchievement, he and his a&s;&s;o|ciates
had (it &s;eems) been made pri&s;oners, after an
ob&s;tinate engagement with the keepers, and car|ried
before a neighbouring ju&s;tice of the peace,
who u&s;ed Trunnion with great indignity, and
with his companions committed him to jail.</P>
<P>His own relations, and in particular an uncle
on whom he chiefly depended, treated him during
his confinement with great rigour and inhuma|nity,
and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to interpo&s;e his in|fluence
in his behalf, unle&s;s he would &s;ign a
writing, obliging him&s;elf to go to &s;ea within thirty
days after his relea&s;e, under the penalty of being
proceeded again&s;t as a felon. The alternative
was either to undergo this voluntary exile, or
remain in pri&s;on di&s;owned and de&s;erted by every
body, and after all &s;uffer an ignominious trial,
that might end in a &s;entence of tran&s;portation
for life. He therefore, without much he&s;itation,
embraced the propo&s;al of his kin&s;man, and (as
he ob&s;erved) was in le&s;s than a month after his
di&s;charge turned adrift to the mercy of the wind
and waves.</P>
<P>Since that period he had never maintained any
corre&s;pondence with his relations, all of whom
had concurred in &s;ending him off; nor would he
<PB N="114" REF="122">
ever pay the lea&s;t regard to the humiliations and
&s;upplications of &s;ome among them, who had
pro&s;trated them&s;elves before him, on the advance|ment
of his fortune: but he retained a mo&s;t in|veterate
re&s;entment for his uncle, who was &s;till
in being, tho' extremely old and infirm, and fre|quently
mentioned his name with all the bitter|ne&s;s
of revenge.</P>
<P>Perry being perfectly well acquainted with the
particulars of this &s;tory, which he had heard &s;o
often repeated, propo&s;ed to Hatchway, that a
per&s;on &s;hould be hired to introduce him&s;elf to the
commodore, with a &s;uppo&s;ititious letter of recom|mendation
from this dete&s;ted kin&s;man; an im|po&s;ition
that, in all likelihood, would afford
abundance of diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The lieutenant reli&s;hed the &s;cheme, and young
Pickle having compo&s;ed an epi&s;tle for the occa|&s;ion,
the exci&s;eman of the pari&s;h, a fellow of
great impudence and &s;ome humour, in whom
Hatchway could confide&punc; undertook to tran|&s;cribe
and deliver it with his own hand, and al&s;o
per&s;onate the man in who&s;e favour i$ was feigned
to be writ. He, accordingly, one morning ar|rived
on hor&s;eback at the garri&s;on, two hours at
lea&s;t before Trunnion u&s;ed to get up, and gave
Pipes, who admitted him, to under&s;tand that he
had a letter for his ma&s;ter, which he was ordered
to deliver to none but the commodore him&s;elf.
This me&s;&s;age was no &s;ooner communicated, than
the indignant chief (who had been waked for the
purpo&s;e) began to cur&s;e the me&s;&s;enger for break|ing
his re&s;t, and &s;wore he would not budge till
his u&s;ual time of turning out. This re&s;olution
being conveyed to the &s;tranger, he de&s;ired the
carrier to go back and tell him, he had &s;uch joy|ful
<PB N="115" REF="123">
tidings to impart, that he was &s;ure the com|modore
would think him&s;elf amply rewarded for
his trouble, even if he had been rai&s;ed from the
grave to receive them.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;urance, flattering as it was, would not
have been powerful enough to per&s;uade him, had
it not been a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the exhortations of his
&s;pou&s;e, which never failed to influence his con|duct.
He therefore crept out of bed, tho' not
without great repugnance, and wrapping him&s;elf
in his morning-gown, was &s;upported down &s;tairs,
rubbing his eye, yawning fearfully, and grumbling
all the way. As &s;oon as he popt his head into
the parlour, the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tranger made divers
awkward bows, and with a grinning a&s;pect ac|co&s;ted
him in the&s;e words: &startq;Your mo&s;t humble
&s;ervant, mo&s;t noble commodore! I hope you are
in good health; you look pure and hearty; and
if it was not for that misfortune of your eye,
one would not de&s;ire to &s;ee a more plea&s;ant coun|tenance
in a &s;ummer's day. Sure as I am a living
&s;oul, one would take you to be on this &s;ide of three|&s;core.
Laud help us! I &s;hould have known you
to be a Trunnion if I had met with you in
the mid&s;t of Sali&s;bury-plain, as the &s;aying is.&endq;
The commodore, who was not at all in the hu|mour
of reli&s;hing &s;uch an impertinent preamble,
interrupted him in this place, &s;aying with a
peevi&s;h accent, &startq;P&s;haw! p&s;haw! brother, there's
no occa&s;ion to bow&s;s out &s;o much unnece&s;&s;ary
gum; if you can't bring your di&s;cour&s;e to bear
on the right &s;ubject, you had much better clap
a &s;topper on your tongue, and bring your&s;elf up,
d'ye &s;ee: I was told you had &s;omething to de|liver.&endq;
&startq;Deliver! (cried the waggi&s;h impo&s;tor)

of yours. Take, read it and be happy. Ble&s;&s;ings
on his old heart! one would think he had re|newed
his age, like the eagles.&endq; Trunnion's
expectation being thus rai&s;ed, he called for his
&s;pectacles, adju&s;ted them to his eye, took the
letter, and being curio$s to know the &s;ub&s;crip|tion&punc;
no &s;ooner perceived his uncle's name, than
he &s;tarted back, his lip quivered, and he began
to &s;hake in every limb with re&s;entment and &s;ur|prize:
neverthele&s;s, eager to know the &s;ubject

what a kind uncle I have been to you in the
days of your y$uth, and how little you de&s;erved
any &s;uch thing; for you was always a gracele&s;s

your aunt Margery, and is not over and above
well as to worldly matters. He thinks of going
to London, to &s;ee for &s;ome po&s;t in the exci&s;e or
cu&s;toms, if &s;o be that you will recommend him
to &s;ome great man of your acquaintance, and
give him a &s;mall matter to keep him till he is
provided. I doubt not, nephew, but you will

<P>It would be a difficult ta&s;k for the inimitable
Hogarth him&s;elf to exhibit the ludicrous expre&s;|&s;ion
of the commodore's countenance, while
he read this letter. It was not a &s;tare of a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
a convul&s;ion of rage, or a gha&s;tly grin of
revenge, but an a&s;&s;ociation of all three, that took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his features. At length he hawked
up, with incredible &s;training, the interjection
ah! that &s;eemed to have &s;tuck &s;ome time in his
windpipe, and thus gave vent to his indignation:
&startq;Have I come along &s;ide of you at la&s;t, you
old &s;tinking curmudgeon! you lie, you lou&s;y
hulk, ye lie! you did all in your power to
founder me when I was a &s;tripling; and as for
being gracele&s;s, and wicked, and keeping bad
company, you tell a damned lie again, you
thief; there was not a more peaceable lad in the
county, and I kept no bad company but your
own, d'ye &s;ee. Therefore, you Trickle, or
what's your name, tell the old ra&s;cal that &s;ent
you hither, that I &s;pit in his face, and call him
<HI>Hor&s;e;</HI> that I tear his letter into rags, &s;o; and
that I trample upon it as I would upon his own
villainous carca&s;e, d'ye &s;ee.&endq; So &s;aying, he
danced in a &s;ort of frenzy upon the fragments of
the paper which he had &s;cattered about the room,
to the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction of the triumvirate,
who beheld the &s;cene.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="126">
The exci&s;eman having got between him and
the door, which was left open for his e&s;cape, in
ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, affected great confu&s;ion and
&s;urprize at this behaviour, &s;aying, with an air of
mortification, &startq;Lord, be merciful unto me!
is this the way you treat your own relations,
and the recommendation of your be&s;t friend?
Surely all gratitude and virtue has left this &s;inful
world! What will cou&s;in Tim, and Dick, and
Tom, and good mother Pipkin, and her daugh|ters,
cou&s;in Sue, and Prue, and Peg, with all
the re&s;t of our kinsfolks &s;ay, when they hear of
this uncon&s;cionable reception that I have met
with. Con&s;ider, Sir, that ingratitude is wor&s;e
than the &s;in of witchcraft, as the apo&s;tle wi&s;ely
ob&s;erves; and do not &s;end me away with &s;uch
unchri&s;tian u&s;age, which will lay a heavy load of
guilt upon your poor mi&s;erable &s;oul.&endq; &startq;What
you are on the cruize for a po&s;t, brother Trickle,
an't ye? (&s;aid Trunnion, interrupting him) we
&s;hall find a po&s;t for you in a trice, my boy.
Here, Pipes, take this &s;aucy &s;on of a bitch,
belay him to the whipping po&s;t in the yard. I'll
teach you to rowce me in a morning with &s;uch
impertinent me&s;&s;ages.&endq; Pipes, who wanted to
carry the joke farther than the exci&s;eman dreamt
of, laid hold on him in a twinkling, and exe|cuted
the orders of his commander, notwith|&s;tanding
all his nods, winking, and &s;ignificant
ge&s;tures, which the boat&s;wain's mate would by
no means under&s;tand: &s;o that he began to repent
of the part he acted in this performance, which
was like to end &s;o tragically, and &s;tood fa&s;tened
to the &s;take, in a very di&s;agreeable &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pence;
ca&s;ting many a rueful look over his left
&s;houlder, (while Pipes was ab&s;ent in que&s;t of a
<PB N="119" REF="127">
cat and nine tails) in expectation of being re|lieved
by the interpo&s;ition of the lieutenant, who
did not&punc; however, appear; and Tom returning
with the in&s;trument of correction, undre&s;&s;ed the
delinquent in a trice, and whi&s;pering in his ear,
that he was very &s;orry for being employed in &s;uch
an office, but dur&s;t not for his &s;oul di&s;obey the
orders of his commander, flouri&s;hed the &s;courge
about his head, and with admirable dexterity
made &s;uch a &s;marting application to the offenders
back and &s;houlders, that the di&s;tracted gauger
performed &s;undry new cuts with his feet, and
bellowed hideou&s;ly with pain, to the infinite &s;a|tisfaction
of the &s;pectators. At length, when he
was almo&s;t flead from his rump to the nape of
his neck, Hatchway, who had purpo&s;ely ab&s;ented
him&s;elf hitherto, appeared in the yard, and in|terpo&s;ing
in his behalf, prevailed upon Trunnion
to call off the executioner, and order the male|factor
to be relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The exci&s;eman, mad with the cata&s;trophe he
had undergone, threatened to be revenged upon
his employers, by making a candid confe&s;&s;ion of
the whole plot; but the lieutenant giving him to
under&s;tand, that in &s;o doing he would bring up|on
him&s;elf a pro&s;ecution for fraud, forgery and
impo&s;ture, he was fain to put up with his lo&s;s,
and &s;neaked out of the garri&s;on, attended with a
volley of cur&s;es di&s;charged upon him by the com|modore,
who was exceedingly irritated by the
di&s;turbance and di&s;appointment he had under|gone.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The commodore detects the machinations of the con|&s;pirators,
and hires a tutor for Peregrine, whom
he &s;ettles at Winche&s;ter &s;chool.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was not the la&s;t affliction he &s;uffered
from the unwearied endeavours and inex|hau&s;ted
invention of his tormentors, who har|ra&s;&s;ed
him with &s;uch a variety of mi&s;chievous
pranks, that he began to think all the devils in
hell had con&s;pired again&s;t his peace; and accord|ingly
became very &s;erious and contemplative on
the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of his meditations, when he re|collected
and compared the circum&s;tances of
every mortification to which he had been lately
expo&s;ed, he could not help &s;u&s;pecting that &s;ome
of them mu&s;t have been contrived to vex him;
and as he was not ignorant of his lieutenant's di&s;|po&s;ition,
nor unacquainted with the talents of
Peregrine, he re&s;olved to ob&s;erve them both for
the future with the utmo&s;t care and circum|&s;pection.
This re&s;olution, aided by the incau|tious
conduct of the con&s;pirators, whom, by this
time, &s;ucce&s;s had rendered heedle&s;s and indi&s;creet,
was attended with the de&s;ired effect. He in a little
time detected Perry in a new plot, and by dint of
a little cha&s;ti&s;ement, and a great many threats,
extorted from him a confe&s;&s;ion of all the con|trivances
in which he had been concerned. The
commodore was thunder&s;truck at the di&s;covery,
and &s;o much incen&s;ed again&s;t Hatchway for the
part he had acted in the whole, that he deliberated
with him&s;elf, whether he &s;hould demand &s;atis|faction
<PB N="121" REF="129">
with &s;word and pi&s;tol, or di&s;mi&s;s him from
the gari&s;on, and renounce all friend&s;hip with
him at once. But he had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed
to Jack's company, that he could not live with|out
him; and upon more cool reflection, per|ceiving
that what he had done was rather the
effect of wantonne&s;s than malice, which he him|&s;elf
would have laughed to &s;ee take place upon
any other per&s;on, he determined to devour his
chagrin, and extend his forgivene&s;s even to Pipes,
whom in the fir&s;t &s;ally of his pa&s;&s;ion he had
looked upon in a more criminal light than that
of a &s;imple mutineer. This determination was
&s;econded by another, which he thought ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary for his own repo&s;e, and in which
his own intere&s;t and that of his nephew con|curred.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was now turned of twelve,
had made &s;uch advances under the in&s;truction of
Je$nings, that he often di&s;puted upon grammar,
and was &s;ometimes thought to have the better
in his conte&s;ts with the pari&s;h-prie&s;t, who, not|with&s;tanding
this acknowledged &s;uperiority of his
antagoni&s;t, did great ju&s;tice to his genius, which
he a&s;&s;ured Mr. Trunnion would be lo&s;t for want
of cultivation, if the boy was not immediately
&s;ent to pro&s;ecute his &s;tudies at &s;ome proper &s;emi|nary
of learning.</P>
<P>This maxim had more than once been inculcated
upon the commodore by Mrs. Trunnion, who, over
and above the deference &s;he paid to the par&s;on's
opinion, had a rea&s;on of her own for wi&s;hing to &s;ee
the hou&s;e clear of Peregrine, at who&s;e prying di&s;po|&s;ition
&s;he began to be very unea&s;y. Induced by
the&s;e motives, which were joined by the &s;ollici|tation
of the youth him&s;elf, who ardently longed
<PB N="122" REF="130">
to &s;ee a little more of the world, his uncle deter|mined
to &s;end him forthwith to Winche&s;ter, under
the immediate care and in&s;pection of a governor,
to whom he allowed a very hand&s;ome appointment
for that purpo&s;e. This gentleman, who&s;e name
was Mr. Jacob Jolter, had been &s;choolfellow
with the par&s;on of the pari&s;h, who recommend|ed
him to Mrs. Trunnion as a per&s;on of great
worth and learning, in every re&s;pect qualified for
the office of a tutor. He likewi&s;e added, by
way of eulogium, that he was a man of exem|plary
piety, and particularly zealous for the ho|nour
of the church of which he was a member,
having been many years in holy orders, tho' he
did not then exerci&s;e any function of the prie&s;t|hood.
Indeed, Mr. Jolter's zeal was &s;o exceed|ingly
&s;ervent, as, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, to get the
better of his di&s;cretion: for, being an high-churchman,
and of con&s;equence a malecontent,
his re&s;entment was habituated into an in&s;ur|mountable
prejudice again&s;t the pre&s;ent di&s;po|&s;ition
of affairs, which, by confounding the na|tion
with the mini&s;try, &s;ometimes led him into
erroneous, not to &s;ay ab&s;urd calculations; Other|wi&s;e,
a man of good morals, well ver&s;ed in ma|thematicks
and &s;chool-divinity, &s;tudies which had
not at all contributed to sweeten and unbend the natural
&s;ourne&s;s and &s;everity of his complexion.</P>
<P>This gentleman being de&s;tined to the charge
of &s;uperintending Perry's education, every thing
was prepared for their departure; and Tom
Pipes, in con&s;equence of his own petition, put
into livery, and appointed footman to the young
&s;quire. But, before they &s;et out, the commo|dore
paid the compliment of communicating his
de&s;ign to Mr. Pickle, who approved of the plan,
<PB N="123" REF="131">
tho' he dur&s;t not venture to &s;ee the boy; &s;o
much was he intimidated by the remon&s;trances
of his wife, who&s;e aver&s;ion to her fir&s;t-born be|came
every day more inveterate and unaccount|able.
This unnatural caprice &s;eemed to be &s;up|ported
by a con&s;ideration which (one would ima|gine)
might have rather vanqui&s;hed her di&s;gu&s;t.
Her &s;econd &s;on Gam, who was now in the fourth
year of his age, had been ricketty from the
cradle, and as remarkably unpromi&s;ing in ap|pearance
as Perry was agreeable in his per&s;on.
As the deformity increa&s;ed, the mother's fond|ne&s;s
was augmented, and the virulence of her
hate again&s;t the other &s;on &s;eemed to prevail in
the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>Far from allowing Perry to enjoy the com|mon
privileges of a child, &s;he would not &s;uffer
him to approach his father's hou&s;e, expre&s;&s;ed un|ea&s;ine&s;s
whenever his name happened to be men|tioned,
&s;ickened at his prai&s;e, and in all re&s;pects
behaved like a mo&s;t rancorous &s;tep-mother. Tho'
&s;he no longer retained that ridiculous notion of
his being an impo&s;tor, &s;he &s;till continued to ab|hor
him, as if &s;he really believed him to be
&s;uch; and when any per&s;on de&s;ired to know the
cau&s;e of her &s;urpri&s;ing di&s;like, &s;he always lo&s;t
her temper, and peevi&s;hly replied, that &s;he had
rea&s;ons of her own, which &s;he was not obliged
to declare: nay, &s;o much was &s;he infected by
this vicious partiality, that &s;he broke off all com|merce
with her &s;i&s;ter-in-law and the commodore,
becau&s;e they favoured the poor child with their
countenance and protection.</P>
<P>Her malice, however, was fru&s;trated by the
love and genero&s;ity of Trunnion, who having
adopted him as his own &s;on, equipped him ac|cordingly,
<PB N="124" REF="132">
and carried him and his governor in
his own coach to the place of de&s;tination, where
they were &s;ettled on a very genteel footing, and
every thing regulated according to their de&s;ires.</P>
<P>Mrs. Trunnion behaved with great decency at
the departure of her nephew, to whom, with a
great many pious advices, and injunctions to be|have
with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and reverence towards his
tutor, &s;he pre&s;ented a diamond ring of &s;mall va|lue,
and a gold medal, as tokens of her affection
and e&s;teem. As for the lieutenant, he accom|panied
them in the coach; and &s;uch was the
friend&s;hip he had contracted for Perry, that when
the commodore propo&s;ed to return, after having
accompli&s;hed the intent of his journey, Jack ab|&s;olutely
refu&s;ed to attend him, and &s;ignified his
re&s;olution to &s;tay where he was.</P>
<P>Trunnion was the more &s;tartled at this de|claration,
as Hatchway was become &s;o nece&s; &s;ary
to him in almo&s;t all the purpo&s;es of his life, that
he fore&s;aw he &s;hould not be able o exi&s;t without
his company. Not a little affected with this
con&s;ideration, he turned his eye ruefully upon
the lieutenant, &s;aying in a piteous tone, &startq;What!
leave me at la&s;t, Jack, after we have weathered
&s;o many hard gales together? D&mdash;n my limbs!
I thought you had been more of an hone&s;t heart:
I looked upon you as my forema&s;t, and Tom
Pipes as my mizzen; now he is carried away,
if &s;o be as you go too, my &s;tanding rigging be|ing
decayed, d'ye &s;ee, the fir&s;t &s;quall will bring
me by the board. D&mdash;n ye, if in ca&s;e I have
given offence, can't ye &s;peak above-board? and
I &s;hall make you amends.&endq;</P>
<P>Jack being a&s;hamed to own the true &s;ituation
of his thoughts, after &s;ome he&s;itation, an&s;wered
<PB N="125" REF="133">
with perplexity and incoherence, &startq;No, damme!
that an't the ca&s;e neither: to be &s;ure you always
u&s;ed me in an officer-like manner, that I mu&s;t
own, to give the devil his due, as the &s;aying is;
but for all that, this here is the ca&s;e, I have &s;ome
thoughts of going to &s;chool my&s;elf to learn your
Latin lingo; for, as the &s;aying is, <HI>Better late
mend than never do well:</HI> and I am informed as
how one can get more for the money here than
any where el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>In vain did Trunnion endeavour to convince
him of the folly of going to &s;chool at his years,
by repre&s;enting that the boys would make game
of him, and that he would become a laughing-&s;tock
to all the world; he per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;o|lution
to &s;tay, and the commodore was fain to
have recour&s;e to the mediation of Pipes and Perry,
who employed their influence with Jack, and at
la&s;t prevailed upon him to return to the gari|&s;on,
after Trunnion had promi&s;ed he &s;hould be
at liberty to vi&s;it them once a month. This &s;ti|pulation
being &s;ettled, he and his friend took
leave of the pupil, governor and attendant, and
next morning &s;et out for their habitation, which
they reached in &s;afety that &s;ame night.</P>
<P>Such was Hatchway's reluctance to leave Pe|regrine,
that he is &s;aid, for the fir&s;t time in his
life, to have looked mi&s;ty at parting: certain I
am, that on the road homewards, after a long
pau&s;e of &s;ilence, which the commodore never
dreamt of interrupting, he exclaimed all of a
&s;udden, &startq;I'll be damned if the dog han't given
me &s;ome &s;tuff to make me love him.&endq; Indeed
there was &s;omething congenial in the di&s;po&s;ition
of the&s;e two friends, which never failed to ma|nife&s;t
<PB N="126" REF="134">

<P>THUS left to the pro&s;ecution of his &s;tu|dies,
Peregrine was in a little time a di|&s;tingui&s;hed
character, not only for his acutene&s;s

a great number of &s;uch luminaries in this new

&s;o con&s;picuous, while they &s;hone in his &s;ingle
capacity, as they afterwards appeared, when they
concentrated and reflected the rays of the whole

<P>At fir&s;t he confined him&s;elf to piddling game,
exerci&s;ing his genius upon his own tutor, who
attracted this attention, by endeavouring to &s;ea|&s;on

fallacy of which he had di&s;cernment enough to
perceive. Scarce a day pa&s;&s;ed, on which he did
not find means to render Mr. Jolter the object of

aukward &s;olemnity and ignorance of man|kind,
afforded continual food for the raillery, pe|tulance
and &s;atire of his pupil, who never neg|lected
an opportunity of laughing, and making
others laugh at his expence.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="135">
Sometimes in their parties, by mixing brandy
in his wine, he decoyed this pedagogue into a
debauch, during which his caution for&s;ook him,
and he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the cen&s;ure of the
company. Sometimes, when the conver&s;ation
turned upon intricate &s;ubjects, he practi&s;ed upon
him the Socratic method of confutation, and,
under pretence of being informed, by an artful
train of puzzling que&s;tions, in&s;en&s;ibly betrayed

he, in a mo&s;t dexterous manner, &s;et on foot a

&s;hame and confu&s;ion. The wench was hand|&s;ome,
Jolter was frail; and one evening, while
in his cups, beheld her with a carnal eye.</P>
<P>Perry, who was ever on the catch, di&s;covered
his longing, and prevailed upon the object of his
p$&s;&s;ion to &s;eed his $$ame with &s;mall favours, until
it became too violent to be re&s;trained: he then
urged his addre&s;&s;es with redoubled ardor, pro|mi&s;ed,
vowed, bribed and intreated; the inamora$$
&s;eemed to yield, and ble&s;&s;ed him with a declara|tion,
that her chamber-door &s;hould be left open
at midnight.</P>
<P>True to the a&s;&s;ignation, he ro&s;e at the hour
appointed, and full of the mo&s;t vigorous expec|tation,
in his &s;hirt, darkling explored his way to
the place of rendezvous. His heart throbbed
with joy when he found immediate admittance;
he &s;aw the cap of his Dulcinea, who &s;eemed to
be a&s;leep; he &s;prung into bed, and cla&s;ped in his
arms&mdash;oh heavens! no other than the
traitor Pipes, who, by his ma&s;ter's direction, per|&s;onated
the maid; and returned the embrace
with &s;uch mu&s;cular contraction, that the unfor|tunate
<PB N="128" REF="136">
lover felt the di&s;appointment, and the im|po&s;&s;ibility
of di&s;$ngaging him&s;elf, at the &s;ame
time. His malicious pupil, attended by another
&s;cholar who lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and the &s;ly
jilt who was the cau&s;e of this di&s;a&s;ter, imme|diately
entered the room with lights, and detected
the forlorn governor in all the mortification of
di&s;grace.</P>
<P>This adventure de&s;troyed all the remains of
authority which he had hitherto pre&s;erved over
Peregrine; &s;o that, for the future, no &s;ort of ce|remony
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, and all Mr. Jol|ter's
precepts were conveyed in hints of friendly
advice, which the other might either follow or
neglect at his own plea&s;ure. No wonder then
that Peregrine gave a loo&s;e to his inclinations,
and by dint of genius and an enterpri&s;ing temper,
made a figure among the younger cla&s;s of heroes
in the college.</P>
<P>Before he had been a fully year at Winche&s;ter,
he had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in &s;o many atchieve|ments,
in defiance to the laws and regulations of
the place, that he was looked upon with admi|ration,
and actually cho&s;en <HI>Dux,</HI> or leader, by
a large body of his cotemporaries. It was not
long before his &s;ame reached the ears of the ma|&s;ter,
who &s;ent for Mr. Jolter, communicated to
him the informations he had received, and de|&s;ired
him to check the vivacity of his charge, and
redouble his vigilance in time to come, el&s;e he
&s;hould be obliged to make a public example of
his pupil for the benefit of the &s;chool.</P>
<P>The governor, con&s;cious of his won unim|portance,
was not a little di&s;concerted at this in|juction,
which it was not in his power to fulfil
by any compul&s;ive means. He therefore went
<PB N="129" REF="137">
home in a very pen&s;ive mood, and after mature
deliberation, re&s;olved to expo&s;tulate with Pere|grine
in the mo&s;t familiar terms, and endeavour
to di&s;&s;uade him from practices which might affect
his character as well as intere&s;t. He accordingly
frankly told him the &s;ubject of the ma&s;ter's di&s;|cour&s;e,
repre&s;ented the di&s;grace he might incur
by neglecting this warning; and putting him in
mind of his won &s;ituation, hinted the con&s;e|quences
of the commodore's di&s;plea&s;ure, in ca&s;e
he &s;hould be brought to di&s;approve of his con|duct.
The&s;e in&s;inuations made the greater im|pre&s;&s;ion,
as they were delivered with many ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of friend&s;hip and concern. The young
gentleman was not &s;o raw, but that he could per|ceive
the &s;olidity of Mr. Jolter's advice, to which
he promi&s;ed to conform, becau&s;e his pride was in|tere&s;ted
in the affair; and he con&s;idered his own
reformation as the only means of avoiding that
infamy which even in idea he could not bear.</P>
<P>His governor finding him &s;o rea&s;onable, pro|$$ted
by the&s;e moments of reflection, and in or|der
to prevent a relap&s;e, propo&s;ed that he &s;hould
engage in &s;ome delightful &s;tudy that would agree|$$$$
amu&s;e his imagination, and gradually de|tach
him from tho&s;e connexions which had in|volved
him in &s;o many trouble&s;ome adventures.
For this purpo&s;e, he, with many rapturous en|c$miums,
recommended the mathematics, as
yielding more rational and &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure to a
youthful fancy than any other &s;ubject of contem|plation;
and actually began to read Euclid with
$$m that &s;ame afternoon.</P>
<P>Peregrine entered upon this branch of learning
with all that warmth of application which boys
commonly yield on the fir&s;t change of &s;tudy;
<PB N="130" REF="138">
but he had &s;carce advanced beyond the <HI>Pons A&s;i|norum,</HI>
when his ardor abated, the te&s;t of truth
by demon&s;tration did not elevate him to tho&s;e
tran&s;ports of joy with which his preceptor had
regaled his expectation; and before he arrived
at the fortieth and &s;eventh propo&s;ition, he began
to yawn drearily, make abundance of wry faces,
and thought him&s;elf but indifferently paid for his
attention, when he &s;hared the va&s;t di&s;covery of
Pyt$azor$s, and under&s;tood that the &s;quare of
the hypothenu&s;e was equal to the &s;quares of the
other two &s;ides of a right angled triangle. He
was a&s;hamed, however, to fail in his undertaking,
and per&s;evered with great indu&s;try, until he had
fini&s;hed the fir&s;t four books, acquired plain tri|gonomet$y,
with the method of algebraical cal|culation,
and made him&s;elf well acquained with
the principles of &s;urveying. But no con&s;idera|tion
could prevail upon him to extend his inquiries
farther in this &s;cience; and he returned with
double reli&s;h to his former avocations, like a
&s;tream which being dammed, accumulates more
force, and bur&s;ting o'er its mounds, ru&s;hes down
with double impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter &s;aw with a&s;toni&s;hment and chagrin,
but could not re&s;i&s;t the torrent. His behaviour
was now no other than a &s;e$ies of licence and ef|fro$tery;
prank &s;ucceeded prank, and outrage
followed outrage with &s;urpri&s;ing velocity. Com|plaints
were every day preferred again&s;t him; in
vain were adm$nitions be&s;towed by the governor
in private, and menaces di&s;charged by the ma&s;ters
in publick; he di&s;regarded the fir&s;t, de&s;pi&s;ed the
latter, dive&s;ted him&s;elf of all manner of re&s;traint,
and proceeded in his career to &s;uch a pitch of au|dacity,
that a con&s;ultation was held upon the &s;ub|ject,
<PB N="131" REF="139">
in which it was determined that this unto|ward
&s;pirit &s;hould be humbled by a &s;evere and ig|nominious
flogging for the very next offence he
&s;hould commit; and in the mean time that Mr. Jolter
&s;hould be de&s;ired to write in the ma&s;ter's
name to the commodore, reque&s;ting him to re|move
Tom Pipes from the per&s;on of his nephew,
the &s;aid Pipes being a principal actor and abettor
in all his malver&s;ations; and to put a &s;top to the
monthly vi&s;itations of the mutilated lieutenant,
who had never once failed to u&s;e his permi&s;&s;ion,
but came punctual to a day, always fraught with
&s;ome new invention. Indeed, by this time, Mr.
Hatchway was as well known, and much better
beloved by every boy in the &s;chool than the ma|&s;ter
who in&s;tructed him, and always received by
a number of the &s;cholars who u&s;ed to attend
Peregrine when he went forth to meet his friend,
and conduct him to his lodging with public te&s;ti|monies
of joy and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>As for Tom Pipes he was not &s;o properly the
attendant of Peregrine, as ma&s;ter of the revels to
the whole &s;chool. He mingled in all their parties,
and &s;uperintended the diver&s;ions, deciding be|tween
boy and boy, as if he acted by commi&s;&s;ion
under the great &s;eal. He regulated their motions
by his whi&s;tle, in&s;tructed the young boys in the
games of hus&s;le-cap, leap-frog, and chuck far|thing;
imparted to tho&s;e of a more advanced age
the &s;ciences of cribbidge and all-fours, together
with the method of &s;torming the ca&s;tle, acting
the comedy of Prince Arthur, and other panto|mimes,
as they are commonly exhibited at &s;ea;
and in&s;tructed the &s;eniors who were di&s;tingui&s;hed
by the appellation of bloods, in cudgel-playing,
dancing the St. Giles's hornpipe, drinking flip
<PB N="132" REF="140">
and &s;moaking tobacco. The&s;e qualifications had
rendered him &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and acceptable to the
&s;cholars, that exclu&s;ive of Perry's concern in the
affair, his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion in all probability, would have
produced &s;ome dangerous convul&s;ion in the com|munity.
Jolter, therefore, knowing his impor|tance,
informed his pupil of the directions he had
received, and very candidly a&s;ked how he &s;hould
demean him&s;elf in the execution; for he dur&s;t not
write to the commodore without this previous
notice, fearing that the young gentleman, as &s;oon
as he &s;hould get an inkling of the affair, would
follow the example, and make his uncle ac|quainted
with certain anecdotes, which it was the
governor's intere&s;t to keep concealed. Peregrine
was of opinion that he &s;hould &s;pare him&s;elf the
trouble of conveying any complaints to the com|modore;
and if que&s;tioned by the ma&s;ter, a&s;&s;ure
him he had complied with his de&s;ire; at the &s;ame
time he promi&s;ed faithfully to conduct him&s;elf
with &s;uch circum&s;pection for the future, that the
ma&s;ters &s;hould have no temptation to revive the
inquiry. But the re&s;olution attending this ex|torted
promi&s;e was too frail to la&s;t, and in le&s;s
than a fortnight our young hero found him&s;elf
intangled in an adventure from which he was not
extricated with his u&s;ual good fortune.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is concerned in a dangerous adventure with a
certain gardener; heads an in&s;urrection in the
&s;chool; takes the field with his adherents, marches
up into the country, and fixes his head quarters at
an inn.</HEAD>
<P>HE and &s;ome of his companions one day en|tered
a garden in the &s;uburbs, and having
indulged their appetites, de&s;ired to know what &s;a|tisfaction
they mu&s;t make for the fruit they had
pulled. The gardener demanded what (in their
opinion) was an exorbitant price, and they with
many opprobious terms refu&s;ed to pay it. The
pea&s;ant being &s;urly and intractable, in&s;i&s;ted upon
his right; neither was he deficient or &s;paring in
the eloquence of vulgar abu&s;e. His gue&s;ts at|tempted
to retreat, a &s;cuffle en&s;ued, in which Pe|regrine
lo&s;t his cap, and the gardener being in
danger from the number of his foes, called to his
wife to let loo&s;e the dog, who in&s;tantly flew to
his ma&s;ter's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and after having tore the
leg of one, and the &s;houlder of another, put the
whole body of &s;cholars to flight. Enraged at the
indignity which had been offered to them, they
&s;olicited a reinforcement of their friends, and with
Tom Pipes at their head, marched back to the
field of battle. Their adver&s;ary &s;eeing them ap|proach,
called his apprentice, who worked at the
other end of the ground, to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, armed
him with a mattock, while he him&s;elf wielded an
hoe, bolted his door on the in&s;ide, and flanked
with his man and ma&s;tiff, waited the attack with|out
flinching. He had not remained three minutes
<PB N="134" REF="142">
in this po&s;ture of defence, when Pipes, who acted
as the enemy's forlorn hope, advanced to the ga$e
with great intrepidity, and clapping his foot to the
door, which was none of the &s;toute&s;t, with the
execution and di&s;patch of a petard, &s;plit it into a
thou&s;and pieces. This &s;udden execution had an
immediate effect upon the 'prentice, who re|treated
with great precipitation, and e&s;caped at
a po&s;tern gate. But the ma&s;ter placed him&s;elf
like another Hercules in the breach; and when
Pipes brandi&s;hing his cudgel, &s;tepped forward to
engage him, levelled his weapon with &s;uch force
and dexterity at his head, that had the &s;kull been
made of penetrable &s;tuff, the iron edge mu&s;t have
cleft his pate in twain. Ca&s;emated as he was,
the in&s;trument cut &s;heer even to the bone, on
which it &s;truck with &s;uch amazing violence, that
&s;parks of real fire were produced by the colli&s;ion.
And let not the incredulous reader pretend to
doubt the truth of this phaenomenon, until he
&s;hall have fir&s;t peru&s;ed the ingenious Peter Kol|ben's
Natural Hi&s;tory of the Cape of Good Hope,
where the inhabitants commonly u&s;e to &s;trike
fire with the &s;hin-bones of lions which have been
killed in that part of Africk.</P>
<P>Pipes, though a little di&s;concerted, far from
being di&s;abled by the blow, in a trice retorted
the compliment with his truncheon, which, had
not his antagoni&s;t expeditiou&s;ly &s;lipped his head
a&s;ide, would have laid him breathle&s;s acro&s;s his
own thre&s;hold; but, happily for him, he received
the &s;alutation upon his right &s;houlder, which
cra&s;hed beneath the &s;troke, and the hoe dropped
in&s;tantly from his tingling hand. Tom perceiv|ing,
and being unwilling to forego the advantage
he had gained, darted his head into the bo&s;om of
<PB N="135" REF="143">
this &s;on of earth, and overturned him on the
plain, being him&s;elf that in&s;tant a&s;&s;aulted by the
ma&s;tif, who fa&s;tened upon the out&s;ide of his
thigh. Feeling him&s;elf incommoded by this a&s;|&s;ailant
in his rear, he quitted the pro&s;trate gar|dener
to the re&s;entment of his a&s;&s;ociates, who
poured upon him in &s;hoals, and turning about,
laid hold with both his hands of this ferocious
animal's throat, which he &s;queezed with &s;uch in|credible
force and per&s;everance, that the creature
quitted his hold; his tongue lolled out of his
jaws, the blood &s;tarted from his eyes, and he
&s;wung a li$ele&s;s trunk between the hands of his
vanqui&s;her.</P>
<P>It was well for his ma&s;ter that he did not
longer exi&s;t; for by this time he was over|whelmed
by &s;uch a multitude of foes, that his
whole body &s;carce afforded points of contact to
all the fi&s;t$ that drummed upon it, con&s;equently,
to u&s;e a vulgar phra&s;e, his wind was almo&s;t knock|ed
out, before Pipes had lei&s;ure to interpo&s;e in his
behalf, and per&s;uade had offenders to de&s;i&s;t, by
repre&s;enting that the wife had gone to alarm the
neighbourhood, and that in all probability, they
would be intercepted in their return. They ac|cordingly
li&s;tened to his remon&s;trances, and
marched homewards in triumph, leaving the gar|dener
in the embraces of his mother earth, from
which he had not power to move when he was
found by his di&s;con&s;olate helpmate and &s;ome
$word$ whom &s;he had a&s;&s;embled for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
Among the&s;e was a black&s;mith and farrier, who
took cognizance of his carca&s;e, every limb of
which having examined, he declared there was
no bone broke, and taking out his fleam, blooded
$im plentifully as he lay. He was then conveyed
<PB N="136" REF="144">
to his bed, from which he was not able to &s;tir
during a whole month, and his family coming
upon the pari&s;h, a formal complaint was made to
the ma&s;ter of the college, and Peregrine repre|&s;ented
as the ring-leader of tho&s;e who committed
this barbarous a&s;&s;ault. An inquiry was immedi|ately
&s;et on foot, and the articles of impeachment
being fully proved, our hero was &s;entenced to be
&s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed in the face of the whole &s;chool.
This was a di&s;grace the thoughts of which his
proud heart could not brook. He re&s;olved to make
his elopement rather than undergo the puni&s;h|ment
to which he was doomed; and having &s;ig|nified
his &s;entiments to his confederates, they pro|mi&s;ed,
one an all, to &s;tand by him, and either
&s;creen him from cha&s;ti&s;ement, or &s;hare his fate.</P>
<P>Confiding in this friendly prote&s;tation, he ap|peared
unconcerned on the day that was appointed
for his puni&s;hment; and when he was called to
his de&s;tiny, advanced towards the &s;cene, attended
by the greate&s;t part of the &s;cholars, who inti|mated
their determination to the ma&s;ter, and
propo&s;ed that Peregrine &s;hould be forgiven. The
&s;uperior behaved with that dignity of demeanor
which became his place, repre&s;ented the folly and
pre&s;umption of their demand, reprehended them
for their audacious proceeding, and ordered every
boy to his re&s;pective &s;tation; but they had gone
too far to retract, and in&s;tead of obeying the in|junction
they had received, marched directly out
of the college, with their captain in the mid&s;t of
them, and halting on a ri&s;ing ground at the di&s;tance
of a &s;hort mile from town, held a council
to deliberate on what was to be done.</P>
<P>This con&s;ultation was too tumultuous to end
in any unanimous deci&s;ion, &s;o that Mr. Pickle
<PB N="137" REF="145">
put him&s;elf at their head, and proceeded &s;traight
forward till the hurry and confu&s;ion that pre|vailed
among them &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide; while Tom
Pipes, who had by this time joined the company,
brought up the rear with great calmne&s;s and tran|quillity,
and never once inquired into the rea&s;on
of this extraordinary migration. They pur&s;ued
this indeterminate cour&s;e for &s;ix miles, when a
public-hou&s;e pre&s;enting it&s;elf to their view, there
was a propo&s;al made to halt for refre&s;hment, and
they di&s;po&s;ed of them&s;elves accordingly, as the
conveniencies of the place would permit. Having
made a very hearty breakfa&s;t on bread and butter
and chee&s;e, which they took care to dilute with
a proportionable quantity of ale; a motion was
made for holding another board, from which the
younger boys were excluded, that they might,
as much as po&s;&s;ible, avoid clamour and di&s;trac|tion
in their coun&s;els. Here Peregrine being in|ve&s;ted
with the &s;upreme command, made a pub|lic
&s;peech to his con&s;tituents, wherein having
thanked them for their generous interpo&s;ition in
his favour, and the great honour they now con|ferred
upon him, he ob&s;erved that in all likeli|hood,
they &s;hould in a little time reap the fruits
of their re&s;olution, and be recalled with honour
to the &s;tudies they had left; but as it would be
nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;evere a little longer, that the
ma&s;ters might &s;ee they were not mere boys whom
they had di&s;obliged, he propo&s;ed that they &s;hould
di&s;mi&s;s the minor brothers who were not capable
of enduring a little fatigue, and depo&s;it all their
money in the hands of one per&s;on who &s;hould be
cho&s;en for that tru&s;t, and to regulate their ex|pence
upon the road; while they advanced far|ther
into the country, and waited patiently for
<PB N="138" REF="146">
the terms which would undoubtedly be propound|ed
unto them. The propo&s;al was unanimou&s;ly
embraced, the money produced, to the amount of
ten guineas, and put into the hands of Pipes, who
was elected caterer and pur&s;er to the whole com|munity;
and the young boys being exhorted to
return, the re&s;t, to the number of five and
twenty, departed under the au&s;pices of Peregrine,
who conducted them ten miles farther to a certain
village, where they took up their lodging at an
inn, and be&s;poke &s;omething hot for &s;upper; after
which they called for punch and &s;trong beer, and
indulged them&s;elves in &s;uch intemperance, that
in a little time riot and di&s;order prevailing, they
&s;allied forth in que&s;t of willing dames to crown
their enjoyment, and committed many other ex|ce&s;&s;es
which the prudence and authority of Pere|grine
could not re&s;train.</P>
<P>In the morning the landlord &s;aved them the
trouble of calling for a bill, and they had the mor|tification
to &s;ee that their night's extravagance had
mounted up their expence to one half of their
whole &s;tock. They di&s;charged the reckoning,
and as few or none of them had any inclination
or appetite for breakfa&s;t, put them&s;elves in mo|tion,
and marched onwards for &s;even miles before
they made another halt. This happened on the
edge of a common, where they perceived the
&s;ign of the George, to the no &s;mall comfort and
&s;atisfaction of &s;ome among them, who&s;e tongues
by this time cleaved to the roofs of their mouths,
in con&s;equence of the debauch of la&s;t night. Here
then they pau&s;ed, and having moi&s;tened their
throats with plentiful &s;treams of ale, began to re|li&s;h
the &s;ituation, and ordered their &s;teward to
provide &s;omething for dinner. The people of the
<PB N="139" REF="147">
hou&s;e would have gladly di&s;pen&s;ed with their cu&s;|tom,
as they had no great faith either in the finan|ces
or principles of their gue&s;ts, who &s;eemed too
young to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much money or con&s;ide|ration.
But as they lived in a &s;olitary place, un|provided
with defence again&s;t the in&s;ults to which
they might be expo&s;ed from the re&s;entment of
&s;uch a di&s;orderly crowd, they would not venture
to &s;ignify their di&s;tru&s;t, and lamented that there
was nothing in the hou&s;e with which they could
entertain them. Tom Pipes, who had ob&s;erved
a flock of gee&s;e upon the common, and abundance
of poultry in the yard, took no notice of the
landlord's declaration, but went out, and in le&s;s
than five mintues returned with provi&s;ion &s;uffici|ent
to regale twice the number of his a&s;&s;ociates.
The woman dur&s;t not venture to di&s;approve of
what he had done, but after having a&s;&s;ured him
that the fowls were none of her own, very peace|ably
employed her whole family in preparing
them for the fire, and &s;ome bacon and greens be|ing
added to the repa&s;t, our company di&s;po&s;ed
them&s;elves in different groups upon the gra&s;s, and
dined with great mirth and &s;atisfaction, without
once recollecting that another &s;uch meal would
utterly exhau&s;t their common fund. However,
this &s;weet in&s;en&s;ibility did not long prevail; about
four o'clock they called to pay, and were very
much &s;tartled to find them&s;elves charged no le&s;s
than two pounds eleven and &s;ixpence for the en|tertainment
they had received. They looked
upon this reckoning as uncon&s;cionable, and di&s;|puted
every article accordingly; but the landlady
&s;olemnly prote&s;ted that the &s;um would barely in|demnify
her, and imputed great part of the charge
to the unnece&s;&s;ary number of gee&s;e and chickens
<PB N="140" REF="148">
which had been &s;laughtered without her know|ledge
or con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Pipes, who on certain &s;ubjects, thought a lit|tle
too much at large, propo&s;ed to puni&s;h her
for her exorbitant demand, by marching off
without paying one farthing; but this advice Pe|regrine
declined with di&s;dain, looking upon &s;u$h
an expedient as incon&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of
the corps which he had the honour to command;
and ordered that the bill &s;hould be immedi$tely
di&s;charged. This affair being &s;ettled to the &s;atis|faction
of all parties concerned, they re&s;umed
their march, and in the evening arrived at a cer|tain
market town, where they re&s;olved to fix
their quarters until they &s;hould hear tidings from
the college which they had left. With this view
they cho&s;e their re&s;idence at the be&s;t inn belong|ing
to the place, and determined to manage the
remains of their fortune with great frugality. But
the &s;pirits of &s;ome among&s;t them beginning to
flag, in con&s;equence of the fatigue of their jour|ney,
and their own reflection that now repre&s;ented
the folly of their de&s;ign, with the uncomfortable
circum&s;tances that mu&s;t in a few hours attend the
con&s;umption of their &s;tock; this prudent &s;cheme
of oeconomy was over-ruled, a huge bowl of
punch prepared, and Pipes ordered to enliven the
company with a &s;ong. Their cares were in a
little time overwhelmed, and the greate&s;t part of
the night was con&s;umed in mirth and jollity;
though next morning they waked in the horrors,
and univer&s;al de&s;pondence took place, when they
learnt that their bank was &s;carce able to defray
the expence of their bill, which they received next
their &s;tomachs, and were obliged to di&s;charge.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="149">
They were now reduced to a dilemma that
occa&s;ioned another general con&s;ultation, in which
they agreed to club their pocket-pieces and &s;ilver
buckles for pre&s;ent &s;upport, and give notice by
letters of their &s;ituation to their re&s;pective rela|tions,
taking care to a&s;cribe their di&s;tre&s;s to the
ill u&s;age they had met with at &s;chool: on this oc|ca&s;ion
Peregrine produced the ring and medal he
had received from Mrs. Trunnion, and Pipes not
only pre&s;ented his own pur&s;e, which was pretty
well furni&s;hed, but even made a proffer of his
&s;ilver whi&s;tle, with the chain by which it had for
many years depended from his neck. They

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The governors tamper with their pupils. Peregrine

<P>MEAN while the ma&s;ter, &s;urpri&s;ed and
di&s;concerted at &s;uch an unprecedented &s;e|ce&s;&s;ion,
convened all the tutors of tho&s;e who
were concerned in this dangerous a&s;&s;ociation, in
order to concert proper mea&s;ures for recalling
them; and after mature deliberation, as it was
the opinion of every body, that &s;uch a number
of raw, hot-headed boys, without money, con|duct,

experience or plan, could not po&s;&s;ibly co|here
for any length of time, they re&s;olved to
leave them to the operation of their own pa&s;|&s;ions;
not doubting that as the fir&s;t impul&s;e
gradually weakened, they would drop off one by
one, and the whole confederacy be thus melted
down. The return of the young boys ju&s;tified
the progno&s;tic; but the ma&s;ters were not a little
alarmed, when they under&s;tood that the re&s;t had
cho&s;en a general, &s;ubmitted to certain regula|tions,
and adopted a determinate de&s;ign. They
re&s;olved, neverthele&s;s, to give them a little more
&s;cope, and waited four and twenty hours for the
effect of their forbearance; when hearing no ac|counts
from the de&s;erters, they began to con|&s;ider
this revolt as a very &s;erious affair; and in
pur&s;uance of their advice and direction, the go|vernors
&s;et out in que&s;t of their &s;tray pupils.</P>
<P>It was not difficult to di&s;cover the rout they
had taken; &s;uch a remarkable caravan could not
pa&s;s unheeded; they got intimation of their ad|vances
from &s;tage to &s;tage, and at night arrived
at an inn that &s;tood on the road, about two
miles &s;hort of the town where the adventures
had &s;ettled their head quarters. From hence they
repaired in a body to the hou&s;e of a neighbouring
ju&s;tice, who, in con&s;equence of their repre&s;en|tations,
granted a warrant to apprehend and &s;e|cure
the body of Thomas Pipes, as an idle va|gabond
and &s;educer of youth. Thus autho|ri&s;ed,
they went early next morning to the town,
and &s;et up their hor&s;es at another inn, where
they remained <HI>incognito,</HI> until they had engaged
the con&s;table with a competent number of a&s;|&s;i&s;tants;
then a per&s;on was &s;ent to inform Mr.
<PB N="143" REF="151">
Pipes, that his company was de&s;ired at the White
Hart.</P>
<P>Tom received this me&s;&s;age immediately after
the contribution of effects, already mentioned;
and imparted the contents to his ma&s;ter, who
rightly judging that it concerned the common
cau&s;e, de&s;ired him to obey the &s;ummons. He
followed the me&s;&s;enger accordingly; and no
&s;ooner &s;et his no&s;e within the room to which he
was directed, than the con&s;table and his po&s;&s;e
&s;prung upon him, before he had the lea&s;t intima|tion
of his de&s;ign, or any opportunity of acting
in his own defence.</P>
<P>Thus overpowered, he was made acquainted
with the cau&s;e of his being arre&s;ted, which, in
all appearance, did not give him a great deal of
concern, and in private committed to jail, where
he was left to his own meditations.</P>
<P>This previous mea&s;ure being &s;ucce&s;sfully taken,
the tutors went into &s;eparate apartments, and
&s;ending for their re&s;pective pupils, each plied his
own charge in particular with &s;uch arguments as
he judged mo&s;t conducive to di&s;&s;uade him from
per&s;evering in the imprudent &s;cheme which he
had already pro&s;ecuted too far. No great elo|quence
was required to accompli&s;h this aim, which
was already more than half effected by their own
reflections; and therefore the greate&s;t part of
them yielded to &s;uch rea&s;onable remon&s;trances,
and con&s;ented to return to &s;chool, provided they
might be indulged with a general amne&s;ty for
what they had done. This they were impow|ered
to promi&s;e to all of them, except Peregrine,
whom, as ringleader and fir&s;t cau&s;e of this di&s;tur|bance,
the ma&s;ter had marked out for a public
example. For this rea&s;on he &s;tood out again&s;t
<PB N="144" REF="152">
all the admonitions of Mr. Jolter, who in vain
conjured him to put up with a little correction,
rather than run the ri&s;k of being ignominiou&s;ly
expelled, and of forfeiting the friend&s;hip of his
uncle, on whom he knew his chief dependance
was built; till at length, &s;eeing his adheren$s
per&s;uaded out of their allegiance, and him&s;elf
bereft of all company and means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence,
he with great reluctance re&s;igned him&s;elf to his
fate; and having obtained the di&s;charge of Pipes,
was reconducted to the college, where, notwith|&s;tanding
the interce&s;&s;ion of his governor, who
begged earne&s;tly that his puni&s;hment might be
mitigated, our unfortunate hero was publickly
hor&s;ed, <HI>in terrorem</HI> of all whom it might concern.</P>
<P>This di&s;grace had a very &s;en&s;ible effect upon
the mind of Peregrine, who having, by this
time, pa&s;&s;ed the fourteenth year of his age, be|gan
to adopt the pride and &s;entiments of a man.
Thus di&s;honourably &s;tigmatized, he was a&s;hamed
to appear in public as u&s;ual; he was incen&s;ed
again&s;t his companions for their infidelity and ir|re&s;olution,
and plunged into a profound reverie
that la&s;ted several weeks&punc; during which he &s;hook
off his boyi&s;h connections, and fixed his view
upon objects which he thought more worthy of
his attention.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of his gymna&s;tic exerci&s;es, at
which he was very expert, he contracted inti|macies
with &s;everal youths who were greatly his
&s;uperiors in point of age, and who, plea&s;ed with
his a&s;piring genius and addre&s;s, introduced him
into parties of gallantry, which &s;trongly capti|vated
his inclination. He was by nature parti|cularly
adapted for &s;ucceeding in adventures of
this kind; over and above a mo&s;t engaging per&s;on
<PB N="145" REF="153">
that improved with his years, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a dig|nified
a&s;&s;urance, an agreeable ferocity which in|hanced
the conque&s;t of the fair who had the good
fortune to en&s;lave him, unlimited genero&s;ity, and
a fund of humour which never failed to plea&s;e.
Nor was he deficient in the more &s;olid accom|pli&s;hments
of youth; he had profited in his &s;tu|dies
beyond expectation, and be&s;ides that &s;en|&s;ibility
of di&s;cernment which is the foundation
of ta&s;te, and in con&s;equence of which he di|&s;tingui&s;hed
and enjoyed the beauties of the Cla&s;|&s;ics,
he had already given &s;everal &s;pecimens of a
very promi&s;ing poetic talent.</P>
<P>With this complexion and the&s;e qualifications,
no wonder that our hero attracted the notice
and affection of the young Delias in town,
who&s;e hearts had ju&s;t begun to flutter for they
knew not what. Inquiries were made concern|ing
his condition; and no &s;ooner were his ex|pectations
known, than he was invited and ca|re&s;&s;ed
by all the parents, while their daughters
vyed with each other in treating him with parti|cular
complacency. He in&s;pired love and emu|lation
wherever he appeared; envy and jealous
rage followed of cour&s;e; &s;o that he became a very
de&s;irable, though a very dangerous acquaintance.
His moderation was not equal to his &s;ucce&s;s;
his vanity took the lead of his pa&s;&s;ions, di&s;&s;ipating
his attention, which might otherwi&s;e have fixed
him to one object; and he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the
rage of increa&s;ing the number of his conque&s;ts.
With this view he frequented public walks, con|certs
and a&s;&s;emblies, became remarkably rich and
fa&s;hionable in his cloaths, gave entertainments
to the ladies, and was in the utmo&s;t hazard of
turning out a mo&s;t egregious coxcomb.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="154">
While his character thus wavered between the
ridicule of &s;ome, and the regard of others, an
accident happened, which, by contracting his
view to one object, detached him from tho&s;e
vain pur&s;uits that would in time have plunged
him into an aby&s;s of folly and contempt. Being
one evening at the ball which is always given to
the ladies at the time of the races, the per&s;on
who acted as ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, knowing
how fond Mr. Pickle was of every opportunity
to di&s;play him&s;elf, came up and told him, that
there was a fine young creature at the other end
of the room, who &s;eemed to have a great incli|nation
to dance a minuet, but wanted a partner,
the gentleman who attended her being in boots.</P>
<P>Peregrine's vanity being arrou&s;ed at this inti|mation,
he went up to reconnoitre the young
lady, and was &s;truck with admiration at her
beauty. She &s;eemed to be of his own age, was
tall, and tho' &s;lender, exqui&s;itely &s;haped; her
hair was auburn, and in &s;uch plenty, that the
barbarity of dre&s;s had not been able to pre|vent
it from &s;hading both &s;ides of her forehead,
which was high and poli&s;hed; the contour of
her face was oval, her no&s;e very little rai&s;ed into
the aquiline form, that contributed to the &s;pirit
and dignity of her a&s;pect; her mouth was &s;mall,
her lips plump, juicy and delicious, her teeth re|gular
and white as driven &s;now, her complexion
incredibly delicate and glowing with health, and
her full blue eyes beamed forth vivacity and love:
her mein was at the &s;ame time commanding and
engaging, her addre&s;s perfectly genteel, and her
whole appearance &s;o captivating, that our young
Adonis looked, and was overcome.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="155">
He no &s;ooner recollected him&s;elf from his a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
than he advanced to her with a grace|ful
air of re&s;pect, and begged &s;he would do him
the honour to walk a minuet with him. She
&s;eemed particularly plea&s;ed with his application,
and very frankly complied with his reque&s;t. This
pair was too remarkable to e&s;cape the particular
notice of the company: Mr. Pickle was well
known by almo&s;t every body in the room, but
his partner was altogether a new face, and of
con&s;equence underwent the critici&s;m of all the
ladies in the a&s;&s;embly; one whi&s;pered, &startq;She has
a good complexion, but don't you think &s;he is a
little awry?&endq; A &s;econd pitied her for her ma&s;|culine
no&s;e; a third ob&s;erved, that &s;he was auk|ward
for want of &s;eeing company; a fourth di|&s;tingui&s;hed
&s;omething very bold in her counte|nance;
and in &s;hort, there was not a beauty in
her whole compo&s;ition, which the gla&s;s of envy
did net pervert into a blemi&s;h.</P>
<P>The men, however, looked upon her with dif|ferent
eyes; among them her appearance pro|duced
an univer&s;al murmur of applau&s;e; they en|circled
the &s;pace on which &s;he danced, and were
enchanted by her graceful motion. While they
launched out in the prai&s;e of her, they expre&s;&s;ed
their di&s;plea&s;ure at the good fortune of her part|ner,
whom they damned for a little finical cox|comb,
that was too much engro&s;&s;ed by the con|templation
of his own per&s;on, to di&s;cern or de|&s;erve
the favour of his fate. He did not hear,
therefore could not repine at the&s;e invectives;
but while they imagined he indulged his vanity,
a much more generous pa&s;&s;ion had taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="156">
In&s;tead of that petulance of gaiety for which
he had been di&s;tingui&s;hed in his public appear|ance,
he now gave manife&s;t &s;igns of confu&s;ion
and concern; he danced with an anxiety which
impeded his performance, and blu&s;hed to the
eyes at every fal&s;e &s;tep he made. Though this
extraordinary agitation was overlooked by the
men, it could not e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of the
ladies, who perceived it with equal &s;urprize and
re&s;entment; and when Peregrine led this fair un|known
to her &s;eat, expre&s;&s;ed their pique in an
affected titter, which broke from every mouth
at the &s;ame in&s;tant, as if all of them had been
informed by the &s;ame &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Peregrine was nettled at this unmannerly mark
of di&s;approbation, and, in order to increa&s;e their
chagrin, endeavoured to enter into particular
conver&s;ation with their fair rival. The young
lady her&s;elf, who neither wanted penetration,
nor the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own accompli&s;h|ments,
re&s;ented their behaviour, though &s;he tri|umphed
at the cau&s;e of it, and gave her partner
all the encouragement he could de&s;ire. Her mo|ther,
who was pre&s;ent, thanked him for his ci|vility
in taking &s;uch notice of a &s;tranger, and he
received a compliment of the &s;ame nature from
the young gentleman in boots, who was her own
brother.</P>
<P>If he was charmed with her appearance, he
was quite ravi&s;hed with her di&s;cour&s;e, which was
&s;en&s;ible, &s;pirited and gay. Her frank and &s;prightly
demeanour excited his own confidence and good
humour; and he de&s;cribed to her the characters
of tho&s;e females who had honoured them with
&s;uch a &s;piteful mark of di&s;tinction, in terms &s;o
replete with humorous &s;atire, that &s;he &s;eemed to
<PB N="149" REF="157">
li&s;ten with particular complacency of attention,
and di&s;tingui&s;hed every nymph thus ridiculed with
&s;uch a &s;ignificant glance, as overwhelmed her
with chagrin and mortification. In &s;hort, they
&s;eemed to reli&s;h each other's conver&s;ation, during
which our young Damon acquitted him&s;elf with
great &s;kill in all the duties of gallantry: he laid
hold of proper opportunities to expre&s;s his ad|miration
of her charms, had recour&s;e to the &s;i|lent
rhetoric of tender looks, breathed divers in|fidious
&s;ighs, and attached him&s;elf wholly to her
during the remaining part of the entertainment.</P>
<P>When the company broke up, he attended
her to her lodgings, and took leave of her with
a &s;queeze of the hand, after having obtained per|mi&s;&s;ion
to vi&s;it her next morning, and been in|formed
by the mother that her name was Mi&s;s
Emilia Gauntlet.</P>
<P>All night long he clo&s;ed not an eye, but
amu&s;ed him&s;elf with plans of plea&s;ure, which his
imagination &s;ugge&s;ted, in con&s;equence of this
new acquaintance. He aro&s;e with the lark, ad|ju&s;ted
his air into an agreeable negligence of
curl, and dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in a genteel grey frock
t$immed with &s;ilver binding, waited with the
utmo&s;t impatience for the hour of ten, which
no &s;ooner &s;truck, than he hied him to the
place of appointment, and inquiring for Mi&s;s
Gauntlet, was &s;hewn into a parlour. Here he
had not waited above ten minutes, when Emilia
entered in a mo&s;t inchanting undre&s;s, with all
the graces of nature playing about her per&s;on,
and in a moment rivetted the chains of his &s;la|very
beyond the power of accident to unbind.</P>
<P>Her mother being &s;till abed, and her brother
gone to give orders about the chai&s;e, in which
<PB N="150" REF="158">
they propo&s;ed to return that &s;ame day to their
own habitation, he enjoyed her company <HI>t&ecirc;te a
t&ecirc;te</HI> a whole hour, during which he declared his
love in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate terms, and begged
that he might be admitted into the number of
tho&s;e admirers whom &s;he permitted to vi&s;it and
adore her.</P>
<P>She affected to look upon his vows and prote&s;ta|tions
as the ordinary effects of gallantry, and very
obligingly a&s;&s;ured him, that were &s;he to live in
that place, &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him often;
but as the &s;pot on which &s;he re&s;ided was at a
con&s;iderable di&s;tance, &s;he could not expect he
would go &s;o far upon &s;uch a trifling occa&s;ion, or
take the trouble of providing him&s;elf with her
mamma's permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To this favourable hint he an&s;wered with all
the eagerne&s;s of the mo&s;t fervid pa&s;&s;ion, that he
had uttered nothing but the genuine dictates of
his heart, and de&s;ired nothing &s;o much as an op|portunity
of evincing the &s;incerity of his profe&s;|&s;ions;
and that though &s;he lived at the extre|mity
of the kingdom, he would find means to
lay him&s;elf at her feet, provided he could vi&s;it
her with her mother's con&s;ent, which he a&s;&s;ured
her he would not fail to &s;ollicit.</P>
<P>She then gave him to under&s;tand, that her ha|bitation
was about &s;ixteen miles from Winche&s;ter,
in a village which &s;he named, and where (as he
could ea&s;ily collect from her di&s;cour&s;e) he would
be no unwelcome gue&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this communication they were
joined by Mrs. Gauntlet, who received him with
great courte&s;y, thanked him again for his polite|ne&s;s
to Emy at the Ball, and anticipated his in|tention,
<PB N="151" REF="159">
by &s;aying that &s;he &s;hould be very glad to
&s;ee him at her hou&s;e, if ever his occa&s;ions &s;hould
call him that way.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He inquires into the &s;ituation of this young lady

is found by the lieutenant, reconveyed to Win|che&s;ter,
and &s;ends a letter with a copy of ver&s;es
to his mi&s;tre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>HE was tran&s;ported with plea&s;ure at this in|vitation,
which he a&s;&s;ured her he &s;hould
not neglect; and after a little more conver&s;ation
on general topics, took his leave of the charm|ing
Emilia and her prudent mamma, who had
perceived the fir&s;t emotions of Mr. Pickle's pa&s;|&s;ion
for her daughter, and been at &s;ome pains to
inquire about his family and fortune.</P>
<P>Neither was Peregrine le&s;s inqui&s;itive about
the &s;ituation and pedigree of his new mi&s;tre&s;s,
who, he learned, was the only daughter of a
field-officer, who died before he had it in his
power to make &s;uitable provi&s;ion for his children;
that the widow lived in a frugal, though decent
manner, on the pen&s;ion, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the bounty
of her relations; that the &s;on carried arms as vo|lunteer
in the company which his father had
commanded; and that Emilia had been educated
in London, at the expence of a rich uncle, who
was &s;eized with the whim of marrying at the age
of fifty-five; in con&s;equence of which, his niece
had returned to her mother, without any vi&s;ible
dependance, except on her own conduct and qua|lifications.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="160">
This account, though it could not dimini&s;h
his affection, neverthele&s;s alarmed his pride; for
his warm imagination had exaggerated all his
own pro&s;pects; and he began to fear, that his
pa&s;&s;ion for Emilia might be thought to derogate
from the dignity of his &s;ituation. The &s;truggle
between his intere&s;t and love produced a per|plexity
which had an evident effect upon his be|haviour;
he became pen&s;ive, &s;olitary and peevi&s;h,
avoided all publick diver&s;ions, and grew &s;o re|markably
negligent in his dre&s;s, that he was
&s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable by his own acquaintance.
This contention of thoughts continued &s;everal
weeks, at the end of which the charms of Emi|lia
triumphed over every other con&s;ideration;
and having received a &s;upply of money from the
commodore, who acted towards him with great
genero&s;ity, he ordered Pipes to put up &s;ome
linnen, and other nece&s;&s;aries, in a &s;ort of knap|&s;ack
which he could conveniently carry, and
thus attended &s;et out early one morning on foot
for the village where his charmer lived, at which
he arrived before two o'clock in the afternoon;
having cho&s;en this method of travelling, that his
rout might not be &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;covered, as it mu&s;t
have been, had he hired hor&s;es, or taken a place
in the &s;tage-coach.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing he did was to &s;ecure a conve|nient
lodging at the inn where he dined; then
he &s;hifted him&s;elf, and according to the direction
he had received, went to the hou&s;e of Mrs.
Gauntlet in a tran&s;port of joyous expectation.
As he approached the gate his agitation increa&s;ed,
he knocked with impatience and concern, the
door opened, and he and actually a&s;ked if Mrs.
Gauntlet was at home, before he perceived that the
<PB N="153" REF="161">
portre&s;s was no other than his dear Emilia. She
was not without emotion at the unexpected &s;ight
of her lover, who in&s;tantly recognizing his charm|er,
obeyed the irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e of his love, and
caught the fair creature in his arms. Nor did
&s;he &s;eem offended at this forwardne&s;s of beha|viour,
which might have di&s;plea&s;ed another of a
le&s;s open di&s;po&s;ition, or le&s;s u&s;ed to the freedom
of a &s;en&s;ible education; but her natural frank|ne&s;s
had been encouraged and improved by the
ea&s;y and familiar intercour&s;e in which &s;he had
been bred; and therefore, in&s;tead of reprimand|ing
him with a &s;everity of look, &s;he with great
good humour rallied him upon his a&s;&s;urance,
which, &s;he ob&s;erved, was undoubtedly the effect
of his own con&s;cious merit, and conducted him
into a parlour, where he found her mother, who
in very polite terms expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction at
&s;eeing him within her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Having drank tea together, Mi&s;s Emy pro|po&s;ed
an evening walk, which they enjoyed
through a variety of little cop&s;es and lawns, wa|tered
by a mo&s;t romantic &s;tream, that quite en|chanted
the imagination of Peregrine.</P>
<P>It was late before they returned from this
agreeable excur&s;ion, and when our lover wi&s;hed
the ladies good night, Mrs. Gauntlet in&s;i&s;ted up|on
his &s;taying to &s;upper, and treated him with
particular demon&s;trations of regard and affection.
As her oeconomy was not encumbered with an

all the tender oaths and in&s;inuations that his pa&s;|&s;i$n

finding him&s;elf unable to &s;upport her ab&s;ence one
day longer, he had quitted his &s;tudies, and left
his governor by &s;tealth, that he might vi&s;it the
object of his adoration, and be ble&s;&s;ed in her
company for a few days without interruption.</P>
<P>She li&s;tened to his addre&s;&s;es with &s;uch affability
as denoted approbation and delight, and gently
chid him as a thoughtle&s;s truant, but carefully
avoided the confe&s;&s;ion of a mutual flame; be|cau&s;e
&s;he di&s;cerned, in the mid&s;t of all his ten|derne&s;s,
a levity of pride which &s;he dur&s;t not
venture to tru&s;t with &s;uch a declaration. Per|haps
&s;he was confirmed in this caution by her mo|ther,
who very wi&s;ely, in her civilities to him,
maintained a &s;ort of ceremonious di&s;tance, which
&s;he thought not only requi&s;ite for the honour and
intere&s;t of her family, but likewi&s;e for her own
exculpation, &s;hould &s;he ever be taxed with hav|ing
encouraged or abetted him in the imprudent
faliies of his youth: $et notwith&s;tanding this af|fected
re&s;erve, he was treated with &s;uch di&s;tinction
both by one and t'other, that he was ravi&s;hed
with his &s;ituation, and became more and more
enamoured every day.</P>
<P>While he remained under the influence of this
&s;weet intoxication, his ab&s;ence produced great
di&s;turbance at Winche&s;ter. Mr. Jolter was g$ie|vou&s;ly
afflicted at his abrupt departure, which
alarmed him the more, as it happened after a
long fit of melancholy which he had perceived in
his pupil. He communicated his apprehen&s;ions
to the ma&s;ter of the &s;chool, who advi&s;ed him
to apprize the commodore of his nephe$'s di&s;ap|pearance,
and in the mean time inquire at all
the inns in town, whether he had hired hor&s;es,
<PB N="155" REF="163">
or any &s;ort of carriage, for his conveyance, or
was not met with on the road by any per&s;on who
could give an account of the direction in which
he travelled.</P>
<P>This &s;crutiny, though performed with great di|ligence
and minutene&s;s, was altogether ineffectual;
they could obtain no intelligence of the runaway.
Mr. Trunnion was well nigh di&s;tracted at the
news of his flight; he raved with great fury at
the imprudence of Peregrine, whom in his fir&s;t
tran&s;ports he damned as an ungrateful de&s;erter;
then he cur&s;ed Hatchway and Pipes, who he
&s;wore had foundered the lad by their pernicious
coun&s;els; and, la&s;tly, transferred his execrations
upon Jolter, becau&s;e he had not kept a better
look-out: finally, he made an apo&s;trophe to that
&s;on of a bitch the gout, which for the pre&s;ent
di&s;abled him from &s;earching for his nephew in
per&s;on. That he might not, however, neglect
any means in his power, he immediately di&s;|patched
expre&s;&s;es to all the &s;ea-port towns on that
coa&s;t, that he might be prevented from leaving
the kingdom; and the lieutenant, at his own de|sire,
was &s;ent acro&s;s the country, in que&s;t of this
young fugitive.</P>
<P>Four days had he un&s;ucce&s;sfully carried on his
inquiries with great accuracy, when re&s;olving to
return by Winche&s;ter, where he hoped to meet
with &s;ome hints of intelligence, by which he
might profit in his future &s;earch, he &s;truck off
the common road, to take the benefit of a nearer
cut; and finding himself benighted near a vil|lage,
took up his lodging at the fir&s;t inn to which
his hor&s;e directed him. Having be&s;poke &s;ome|thing
for &s;upper, and retired to his chamber,
where he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with a pipe, he heard
<PB N="156" REF="164">
a confu&s;ed noi&s;e of ru&s;tic jollity, which being all
of a &s;udden interrupted, after a &s;hort pau&s;e his
car was saluted by the voice of Pipes, who, at
the &s;ollicitation of the company, began to enter|tain
them with a &s;ong.</P>
<P>Hatchway in&s;tantly recognized the well-known
&s;ound, in which indeed he could not po&s;&s;ibly be
mi&s;taken, as nothing in nature bore the lea&s;t re|&s;emblance
to it; he threw his pipe into the
chimney, and &s;natching up one of his pi&s;tols, ran
immediately to the apartment from whence the
voice i&s;&s;ued: he no &s;ooner entered, than di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
his old &s;hip-mate in a crowd of country
pea&s;ants, he in a moment &s;prung upon him, and
clapping his pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, exclaimed,
&startq;Damn you, Pipes, you're a dead man, if you
don't immediately produce young ma&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>This menacing application had a much greater
effect upon the company than upon Tom, who
looking at the lieutenant with great tranquillity,
replied, &startq;Why &s;o I can, Ma&s;ter Hatchway.&endq;
&startq;What! &s;afe and &s;ound?&endq; cried the other.
&startq;As a roach,&endq; an&s;wered Pipes, &s;o much to the
&s;atisfaction of his friend Jack, that he &s;hook him
by the hand, and de&s;ired him to proceed with
his &s;ong. This being performed, and the reck|oning
di&s;charged, the two friends adjourned to
the other room, where the lieutenant was in|formed
of the manner in which the young gen|tleman
had made his elopement from college, as
well as of the other particulars of his pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation,
as far as they had fallen within the &s;phere
of his comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>While they &s;at thus conferring together, Pe|regrine
having taken his leave of his mi&s;tre&s;s for
$he night, came home, and was not a little &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
<PB N="157" REF="165">
when Hatchway entering his chamber in
his &s;ea attitude, thru&s;t out his hand by way of
&s;alutation. His old pupil received him as u&s;ual,
with great cordiality, and expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;h|ment
at meeting him in that place; but when
he under&s;tood the cau&s;e and intention of his arri|val,
he &s;tarted with concern; and his vi&s;age
glowing with indignation, told him he was old
enough to be judge of his own conduct, and
when he &s;hould &s;ee it convenient, would return
of him&s;elf; but tho&s;e who thought he was to be
compelled to his duty, would find them&s;elves
egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The lieutenant a&s;&s;ured him, that for his own
part he had no intention to offer him the lea&s;t
violence; but, at the &s;ame time, he repre&s;ented
to him the danger of incen&s;ing the commodore,
who was already almo&s;t di&s;tracted on account of
his ab&s;ence: and in &s;hort, conveyed his argu|ment,
which were equally obvious and valid, in
&s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and re&s;pect, that
Peregrine yielded to his remon&s;trances, and pro|mi&s;ed
to accompany him next day to Winche&s;ter.</P>
<P>Hatchway, overjoyed at the &s;ucce&s;s of his nego|ciation,
went immediately to the ho&s;tler and be|&s;poke
a po&s;t-chai&s;e for Mr. Pickle and his man, with
whom he afterwards indulged him&s;elf in a double
cann of rumbo, and when the night was pretty
far advanced, left the lover to his repo&s;e, or ra|ther
to the thorns of his own mediation; for he
&s;lept not one moment, being ince&s;&s;antly tortured
with the pro&s;pect of parting from his divine Emi|lia,
who had now acquired the mo&s;t ab&s;olute em|pire
over his &s;oul. One minute he propo&s;ed to
depart early in the morning, without &s;eeing this
enchantre&s;s, in who&s;e bewitching pre&s;ence he
<PB N="158" REF="166">
dur&s;t not tru&s;t his own re&s;olution. Then the
thoughts of leaving her in &s;uch an abrupt and
di&s;re&s;pectful manner, interpo&s;ed in favour of his
love and honour. This war of &s;entiments kept
him all night upon the rack, and it was time to
ri&s;e before he had determined to vi&s;it his charmer,
and candidly impart the motives that induced him
to leave her.</P>
<P>He accordingly repaired to her mother's hou&s;e
with a heavy heart, being attended to the gate
by Hatchway, who did not choo&s;e to leave him
alone; and being admitted, found Emilia ju&s;t
ri&s;en, and in his opinion, more beautiful than
ever.</P>
<P>Alarmed at his early vi&s;it, and the gloom that
over&s;pread his countenance, &s;he &s;tood in &s;ilent
expectation of hearing &s;ome melancholy tidings;
and it was not till after a con&s;iderable pau&s;e, that
he collected re&s;olution enough to tell her he was
come to take his leave. Though &s;he &s;trove to
conceal her &s;orrow, nature was not to be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed;
every feature of her countenance &s;ad|dened
in a moment, and it was not without the
utmo&s;t difficulty that &s;he kept her lovely eyes
from overflowing. He &s;aw the &s;ituation of her
thoughts, and in order to alleviate her concern,
a&s;&s;ured her he &s;hould find means to &s;ee her again
in a very few weeks; mean while he communi|cated
his rea&s;ons for departing, in which &s;he rea|dily
acquie&s;ced; and having mutually con&s;oled
each other, their tran&s;ports of grief &s;ub&s;ided, and
before Mrs. Gauntlet came down &s;tairs they were
in a condition to behave with great decency and
re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>This good lady expre&s;&s;ed her concern when
&s;he learnt his re&s;olution, &s;aying, &s;he hoped his
<PB N="159" REF="167">
occa&s;ions and inclinations would permit him to
favour them with his agreeable company another
time.</P>
<P>The lieutenant, who began to be unea&s;y at
Peregrine's &s;tay, knocked at the door, and being
introduced by his friend, had the honour of
breakfa&s;ting with the ladies; on which occa&s;ion
his heart received &s;uch a rude &s;hock from the
charms of Emilia, that he afterwards made a me|rit
with his friend of having con&s;trained him&s;elf
&s;o far, as to forbear commencing his profe&s;&s;ed
rival.</P>
<P>At length they bad adieu to their kind enter|tainers,
and in le&s;s than an hour &s;etting out from
the inn, arrived about two o'clock in Winche&s;ter,
where Mr. Jolter was overwhelmed with joy at
their appearance.</P>
<P>The nature of this adventure being unknown
to all except tho&s;e who could be depended upon,
every body who inquired about the cau&s;e of Pe|regrine's
ab&s;ence, was told that he had been with
a relation in the country, and the ma&s;ter conde|&s;cended
to overlook his indi&s;cretion; &s;o that
Hatchway &s;eeing every thing &s;ettled to the &s;ati&s;|faction
of his friend, returned to the garri&s;on,
and gave the commodore an account of his expe|dition.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was very much &s;tartled
when he heard there was a lady in the ca&s;e, and
very emphatically ob&s;erved, that a man had bet|ter
be &s;ucked into the gulph of Florida than once
get into the indraught of woman; becau&s;e in one
ca&s;e, he may with good pilotage bring out his ve&s;|&s;el
&s;afe between the Bahama's and the Indian
&s;hore; but in the other there is no outlet at all,
and it is in vain to &s;trive again&s;t the current; &s;o
<PB N="160" REF="168">
that of cour&s;e he mu&s;t be embayed, and run chuck
upon a lee-&s;hore. He re&s;olved, therefore, to lay
the &s;tate of the ca&s;e before Mr. Gamaliel Pickle,
and concert &s;uch mea&s;ures with him as &s;hould be
thought likelie&s;t to detach his &s;on from the pur|&s;uit
of an idle amour, which could not fail of in|terfering
in a dangerous manner with the plan of
his education.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Perry's ideas were totally
engro&s;&s;ed by his amiable mi&s;tre&s;s, who, whether
he &s;lept or waked, was &s;till pre&s;ent in his imagi|nation,

This juvenile production was inclo&s;ed in a very

Mrs. Gauntlet's habitation with a pre&s;ent of ve|ni&s;on,

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">His me&s;&s;enger meets with a misfortune, to which he
applies a very extraordinary expedient that is at|tended
with &s;trange con&s;equences.</HEAD>
<P>AS a &s;tage coach pa&s;&s;ed within two miles of
the village where &s;he lived, Tom bar|gained
with the driver for a &s;eat on the box, and
accordingly departed on this me&s;&s;age, though he
was but indifferently qualified for commi&s;&s;ions of
&s;uch a nature: having received particular injunc|tioins
about the letter, he re&s;olved to make that
the chief object of his care, and very &s;agaciou&s;ly
conveyed it between his &s;tocking and the &s;ole of
his foot, where he thought it would be perfectly
&s;ecure from all injury and accident. Here it re|mained
until he arrived at the inn where he had
formerly lodged, when a$ter having refre&s;hed him|&s;elf
with a draught of beer, he pulled off his &s;tock|ing,
and found the poor billet fullied with du&s;t,
and torn into a thou&s;and tatters by the motion of
his foot in walking the la&s;t two miles of his jour|ney.
Thunder&s;truck at this phaenomenon, he
uttered a long and loud <HI>whew!</HI> which was &s;uc|ce$ded
by an exclamation of &startq;Damn my old
&s;hoes! a bite by G&mdash;!&endq; then he re&s;ted his elbows
<PB N="162" REF="170">
on the table, and his forehead upon his two fi&s;ts,
and in that attitude deliberated with him&s;elf upon
the means of remedying this misfortune.</P>
<P>As he was not di&s;tracted by a va&s;t number of
ideas, he &s;oon concluded that his be&s;t expedient
would be to employ the clerk of the pari&s;h, who
he knew was a great &s;cholar, to write another
epi&s;tle according to the directions he &s;hould give
him; and never dreaming that the mangled ori|ginal
would in the lea&s;t facilitate this &s;cheme, he
very wi&s;ely committed it to the flames, that it
might never ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Having taken this wi&s;e &s;tep, he went in que&s;t
of his &s;cribe, to whom he communicated his bu|&s;ine&s;s,
and promi&s;ed a full-pot by way of gratifi|cation.
The clerk, who was al&s;o &s;chool-ma&s;ter,
proud of an opportunity to di&s;tingui&s;h his talents,
readily undertook the ta&s;k; and repairing with
his employer to the inn, in le&s;s than a quarter of
an hour produced a mor&s;el of eloquence &s;o much
to the &s;atisfaction of Pipes, that he &s;queezed his
hand by way of acknowledgement, and doubled
his allowance of beer, which being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, our
courier betook him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of Mrs. Gaunt|let
with the haunch of veni&s;on and this &s;ucceda|neous
letters, and delivered his me&s;&s;age to the mo|ther,
who received it with great re&s;pect, and
many kind inquiries about the health and welfare
of his ma&s;ter, attempting to tip the me&s;&s;enger
a crown, which he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to accept,
in con&s;equence of Mr. Pickle's repeated caution.
While the old gentlewoman turned to a &s;ervant,
in order to give directions about the di&s;po&s;al of
this pre&s;ent, Pipes looked upon this as a favour|able
occa&s;ion to tran&s;act his bu&s;ine&s;s with Emilia,
and therefore, &s;hutting one eye, with a jirk of his
<PB N="163" REF="171">
thumb towards his left &s;houlder, and a mo&s;t &s;ig|nificant
twi&s;t of his countenance, he beckoned
the young lady into another room, as if he had
been fraught with&s;omething of con&s;equences, which
he wanted to impart. She under&s;tood the hint
how&s;oever &s;trangely communicated, and by &s;tep|ing
to one &s;ide of the room, gave him an op|portunity
of &s;lipping the epi&s;tle into her hand,
which he gently &s;queezed at the &s;ame time in
token of regard; then throwing a &s;ide-glance at
the mother, who&s;e back was turned, clapped his
finger to one &s;ide of his no&s;e, thereby recom|mending
&s;ecrecy and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Emilia conveying the letter into her bo&s;om,
could not help &s;miling at Tom's politene&s;s and
dexterity; but left her mamma &s;hould detect him
in the execution of his pantomime, &s;he broke off
this intercour&s;e of &s;igns, by a&s;king aloud when he
propo&s;ed to &s;et out on his return to Winche&s;ter;
and when he an&s;wered &startq;To-morrow morning,&endq;
Mrs. Gauntlet recommended him to the ho&s;pita|lity
of her own footman, de&s;iring him to make
much of Mr. Pipes below, where he was kept to
&s;upper, and very cordially entertained. Our
young heroine, impatient to read her lover's billet,
which made her heart throb with rapturous ex|pectation,
retired to her chamber as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible,

</LETTER>
<P>Never was a&s;toni&s;hment more perplexing than
that of Emilia, when &s;he read this curious com|po&s;ition,
which &s;he repeated verbatim three times
before &s;he would credit the evidence of her own
&s;en&s;es. She began to fear in good earne&s;t that
love had produced a di&s;order in her lover's under|&s;tanding;
but after a thou&s;and conjectures by
which &s;he attempted to account for this extraor|dinary
&s;u&s;tian of &s;tile, &s;he concluded that it was
the effect of mere levity, calculated to ridicule
the pa&s;&s;ion he had formerly profe&s;&s;ed. Irritated
by this &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;he re&s;olved to baulk his tri|umph
with affected indifferences, and in the mean
time endeavour to expel him from that place
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed within her heart. And indeed,
&s;uch a victory over her inclinations might have
been obtained without great difficulty; for &s;he
enjoyed an ea&s;ine&s;s of temper that could accom|modate
it&s;elf to the emergencies of her fate; and
her vivacity by amu&s;ing her imagination, pre|&s;erved
<PB N="165" REF="173">
her from the keener &s;en&s;ations of &s;orrow.
Thus determined and di&s;po&s;ed, &s;he did not &s;end
any &s;ort of an&s;wer, or the lea&s;t token of remem|brance
by Pipes, who was &s;uffered to depart with
a general compliment from the mother, and ar|rived
at Winche&s;ter the next day.</P>
<P>Peregrine's eyes &s;parkled when he &s;aw his me&s;|&s;enger
come in, and he &s;tretched out his hand in
full confidence of receiving &s;ome particular mark
of his Emilia's affection; but how was he con|founded,
when he felt his hope &s;o cruelly di&s;ap|pointed!
In an in&s;tant his countenance fell. He
&s;tood for &s;ome time &s;ilent and aba&s;hed, then thrice
repeated the interrogation of &startq;What! not one
word from Emilia?&endq; And dubious of his courier's
di&s;cretion, inquired minutely into all the particu|lars
of his reception. He a&s;ked if he had &s;een the
young lady, if &s;he was in good health, if he had
found an opportunity of delivering his letter, and
how &s;he looked when he put it into her hand?
Pipes an&s;wered, that he had never &s;een her in
better health or higher &s;pirits; that he had ma|naged
matters &s;o as not only to pre&s;ent the billet
unperceived, but al&s;o to a&s;k her commands in
private before he took his leave, when &s;he told
him that the letter required no reply. This la&s;t
circum&s;tance he con&s;idered as a mainfe&s;t mark of
di&s;re&s;pects, and gnawed his lips with re&s;entment.
Upon further reflexion, however, he &s;uppo&s;ed
that &s;he could not conveniently write by the me&s;|&s;enger,
and would undoubtedly favour him by
the po&s;t. This con&s;ideration con&s;oled him for
the pre&s;ent, and he waited impatiently for the
fruits of his hope; but after he had &s;een eight
days elap&s;ed without reaping the &s;atisfaction with
which he had flattered him&s;elf, his temper for&s;ook
<PB N="166" REF="174">
him, he raved again&s;t the whole &s;ex, and was
&s;eized with a fit of &s;ullen chagrin; but his pride
in a little time came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and re&s;cued
him from the horrors of the melancholy fiend.
He re&s;olved to retort her own neglect upon his
ungrateful mi&s;tre&s;s, his countenance gradually re|&s;umed
its former &s;erenity; and though by this
time he was pretty well cured of his foppery, he
appeared again at public diver&s;ions with an air of
gaiety and unconcern, that Emilia might have a
chance of hearing how much, in all likelihood, he
di&s;regarded her di&s;dain.</P>
<P>There are never wanting certain officious per|&s;ons,
who take plea&s;ure in promoting intelligence
of this &s;ort. His behaviour &s;oon reached the ears
of Mi&s;s Gauntlet, and confirmed her in the opi|nion
&s;he had conceived from his letter; &s;o that
&s;he fortified her&s;elf in her former &s;entiments, and
bore his indifference with great philo&s;ophy. Thus
a corre&s;pondence which had commenced with all
the tenderne&s;s and &s;incerity of love, and every
promi&s;e of duration, was interrupted in its infancy
by a mi&s;under&s;tanding occa&s;ioned by the &s;impli|city
of Pipes, who never once reflected upon the
con&s;equences of his deceit.</P>
<P>Though their mutual pa&s;&s;ion was by the&s;e
means &s;uppre&s;&s;ed for the pre&s;ent, it was not alto|gether
extingui&s;hed, but glowed in &s;ecret, though
even to them&s;elves unknown, until an occa&s;ion
which afterwards offered, blew up the latent flame,
and love re&s;umed his empire in their brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>While they moved, as it were, without the
&s;phere of each other's attraction, the commodore
fearing that Perry was in danger of involving
him&s;elf in &s;ome pernicious engagement, re&s;olved
by advice of Mr. Jolter and his friend the pari&s;h
<PB N="167" REF="175">
prie&s;t, to recal him from the place where he had
contracted &s;uch imprudent connexions, and &s;end
him to the univer&s;ity, where his education might
be compleated, and his fancy weaned from all
puerile amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>This plan had been propo&s;ed to his own fa|ther,
who, as hath been already ob&s;erved, &s;tood
always neuter in every thing that concerned his
elde&s;t &s;on; and as for Mrs. Pickle, &s;he had never
heard his name mentioned &s;ince his departure
with any degree of temper or tranquillity, except
when her hu&s;band informed her that he was in a
fair way of being ruined by this indi&s;creet amour.
It was then &s;he began to applaud her own fore&s;ight,
which had di&s;cerned the mark of reprobation in
that vicious boy, and launched out in compari|&s;ons
between him and Gammy, who, &s;he ob|&s;erved,
was a child of uncommon parts and &s;oli|dity,
and with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, would be a
comfort to his parents, and an ornament to the
family.</P>
<P>Should I affirm that this favourite whom &s;he
commonded &s;o much, was in every re&s;pect the
rever&s;e of what &s;he de&s;cribed; that he was a boy
of mean capacity, and though remarkably di&s;torted
in his body, much more crooked in his di&s;po&s;i|tion;
and that &s;he had per&s;uaded her hu&s;band to
e&s;pou&s;e her opinion, though it was contrary to
common &s;en&s;e, as well as to his own perception;
I am afraid the reader will think I repre&s;ent a
mon&s;ter that never exi&s;ted in nature, and be apt
to condemn the oeconomy of my invention; ne|verthele&s;s,
there is nothing more true than every

wi&s;h the picture, &s;ingular as it is, may not be

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine is &s;ummoned to attend his uncle, is more
and more hated by his own mother; appeals to
his father, who&s;e conde&s;cen&s;ion is defeated by the
dominion of his wife.</HEAD>
<P>BUT waving the&s;e reflections, let us return
to Peregrine, who received a &s;ummons to
attend his uncle, and in a few days arrived with
Mr. Jolter and Pipes at the garri&s;on, which he
filled with joy and &s;atisfaction. The alteration,
which, during his ab&s;ence, had happened in his
per&s;on, was very favourable to his appearance,
which from that of a comely boy, was converted
into that of a mo&s;t engaging youth. He was al|ready
taller than a middle-&s;ized man, his &s;hape
a&s;certained, his &s;inews well knit, his mien greatly
improved, and his whole figure as elegant and
graceful, as if it had been ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould
with the Apollo of Belvidere.</P>
<P>Such an out&s;ide could not fail of prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
people in his favour. The commedore,
notwith&s;tanding the advantageous reports he had
heard, found his expectation exceeded in the per|&s;on
of Peregrine, and &s;ignified his approbation in
the mo&s;t &s;anguine terms. Mrs. Trunnion was
&s;truck with his genteel addre&s;s, and received him
with uncommon marks of complacency and af|fection;
he was care&s;&s;ed by all the people in the
neighbourhood, who, while they admired his ac|compli&s;hments,
could not help pitying his infa|tuated
mother, who was deprived of that unut|terable
delight which any other parent would
<PB N="169" REF="177">
have enjoyed in the contemplation of &s;uch an
amiable &s;on.</P>
<P>Divers efforts were made by &s;ome well-di&s;po&s;ed
people, to conquer, if po&s;&s;ible, this mon&s;trous
prejudice; but their endeavours, in&s;tead of curing,
&s;erved only to inflame the di&s;temper, and &s;he ne|ver
could be prevailed upon to indulge him in the
lea&s;t mark of maternal regard. On the contrary,
her original di&s;gu&s;t degenerated into &s;uch invete|racy
of hatred, that &s;he left no &s;tone unturned to
alienate the commodore's affection for this her
innocent child, and even practi&s;ed the mo&s;t ma|licious
defamation to accompli&s;h her purpo&s;e.
Every day did &s;he abu&s;e her hu&s;band's ear with
&s;ome forged in&s;tance of Peregrine's ingratitude to
his uncle, well knowing that it would reach the
commodore's knowledge at night.</P>
<P>Accordingly Mr. Pickle u&s;ed to tell him at the
club, that his hopeful favourite had ridiculed him
in &s;uch a company, and a&s;per&s;ed his &s;pou&s;e upon
another occa&s;ion; and thus retail the little &s;can|dalous
i&s;&s;ue of his own wife's invention. Luckily
for Peregrine, the commodore paid no great re|gard
to the authority of his informer, becau&s;e he
knew from what canal his intelligence flowed;
be&s;ides, the youth had a &s;taunch friend in Mr.
Hatchway, who never failed to vindicate him
when he was thus unju&s;tly accu&s;ed, and always
found argument enough to confute the a&s;&s;ertions
of his enemies. But, though Trunnion had been
dubious of the young gentleman's principles, and
deaf to the remon&s;trances of the lieutenant, Perry
was provided with a bulwark &s;trong enough to
defend him from all &s;uch a&s;&s;aults. This was no
other than his aunt, who&s;e regard for him was
perceived to increa&s;e in the &s;ame proportion as his
<PB N="170" REF="178">
own mother's dimini&s;hed; and indeed, the aug|mentation
of the one was, in all probability, ow|ing
to the decrea&s;e of the other; for the two la|dies,
with great civility, performed all the duties
of good neighbourhood, and hated each other
mo&s;t piou&s;ly in their hearts.</P>
<P>Mrs. Pickle having been di&s;obliged at the
&s;plendor of her &s;i&s;ter's new eq$ipage, had ever
&s;ince that time, in the cour&s;e of her vi&s;iting, en|deavoured
to make people merry with &s;atirical
jokes on that poor lady's infirmit$es; and Mrs.
Trunnion &s;eized the very fir&s;t opportunity of
making repri&s;als, by inveighing again&s;t her unna|tural
behaviour to her own child; &s;o that Pere|grine,
as on the one hand he was abhorred, &s;o
on the other was he care&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence of
this contention; and I firmly believe that the
mo&s;t effectual method of de&s;tro$ing his intere&s;t at
the garri&s;on, would have been the &s;hew of coun|tenancing
him at his father's hou&s;e: but, whe|ther
this conjecture be rea&s;onable or chimerical,
certain it is the experiment was never tried, and
therefore Mr. Peregrine r$n no ri&s;k of being di&s;|graced.
The commodore, who $&s;&s;umed, and ju&s;tly
too, the whole merit of his education, was now
as proud of the youth's improvements, as if he
had actually been his own offspring; and &s;ome|times
his affection ro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch of enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
that he verily believed him to be the i&s;&s;ue
of his own loins. Notwith&s;tanding this favour|able
predicament in which our hero &s;tood with his
aunt and her hu&s;band, he could not help feeling
the injury he &s;uffered from the caprice of his
mother; and though the gaiety of his di&s;po&s;ition
hindered him from afflicting him&s;elf with reflexi|ons
of any gloomy ca&s;t, he did not fail to for&s;ee
<PB N="171" REF="179">
that if any &s;udden accident &s;hould deprive him
of the commodore, he would in all likelihood
find him&s;elf in a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation.
Prompted by this con&s;ideration, he one evening
accompanied his uncle to the club, and was in|troduced
to his father, before that worthy gentle|man
had the lea&s;t inkling of his arrival.</P>
<P>Mr. Gamaliel was never &s;o di&s;concerted as at
this rencounter. His own di&s;po&s;ition would not
&s;uffer him to do any thing that might create the
lea&s;t di&s;turbance, or interrupt his evening's enjoy|ment;
and &s;o &s;trongly was he impre&s;&s;ed with the
terror of his wife, that he dur&s;t not yield to the
tranquillity of his temper: and, as I have already
ob&s;erved, his inclination was perfectl$ neutral.
Thus di$tracted between different motives, when
Perry was pre&s;ented to him, he &s;at &s;ilent and ab|&s;orpt,
as if he did not or would not perceive the
application; and when he was urged to declare
him&s;elf by the youth, who pathetically begged to
know how he had incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure, he
an&s;wered in a peevi&s;h &s;train, &startq;Why, good now,
child, what would you have me to do? your
mother can't abide you.&endq; &startq;If my mother is &s;o
unkind, I will not call it unnatural, (&s;aid Pere|grine,
the tears of indignation &s;tarting from his
eyes) as to bani&s;h me from her pre&s;ence and af|fection,
without the lea&s;t cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned; I hope
you will not be &s;o unju&s;t as to e&s;pou&s;e her barba|rous
prejudice.&endq; Before Mr. Pickle had time to
reply to this expo&s;tulation, for which he was not
at all prepared, the commodore interpo&s;ed, and
enforced his favourite's remon&s;trance, by telling
Mr. Gamaliel that he was a&s;hamed to &s;ee any
man $rive in &s;uch a mi&s;erable manner under his
wife's petticoat.&endq; As for my own part, (&s;aid he,
<PB N="172" REF="180">
rai&s;ing his voice, and a&s;&s;uming a look of impor|tance
and command) before I would &s;uffer my&s;elf
to be &s;teered all weathers by any woman in Chri&s;|tendom,
d'ye &s;ee, I'd rai&s;e &s;uch a hurricane about
her ears that&endq;&mdash;Here he was interrupted by
Mr. Hatchway, who thru&s;ting his head towards
the door, in the attitude of one that li&s;tens, cried
&startq;Ahey! there's your &s;pou&s;e come to pay us a
vi&s;it.&endq; Trunnion's features that in&s;tant adopted
a new di&s;po&s;ition: fear and confu&s;ion took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his countenance; his voice from a tone
of vociferation &s;unk into a whi&s;per of &startq;Sure you
mu&s;t be mi&s;taken, Jack;&endq; and in great perplexity
he wiped off the &s;weat which had &s;tarted on his
forehead at this fal&s;e alarm. The lieutenant hav|ing
thus puni&s;hed him for the rhodomontade he
had uttered, told him with an arch &s;neer, that
he was deceived by the &s;ound of the outward door
creaking upon its hinges, which he mi&s;took for
Mrs. Trunnion's voice, and de&s;ired him to pro|ceed
with his admonitions to Mr. Pickle. It is
not to be denied that this arrogance was a little
un&s;ea&s;onable in the commodore, who was in all
re&s;pects as effectually &s;ubdued to the dominion of
his wife, as the per&s;on who&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he then
ventured to condemn; with this difference of di&s;|po&s;ition:
Trunnion's &s;ubjection was like that of
a bear, chequered with fi$s of &s;urline&s;s and rage;
whereas Pickle bore the yoke like an ox, without
repining. No wonder then that this indolence,
this &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s, this &s;tagnation of temper, ren|dered
Gamaliel incapable of with&s;tanding the ar|guments
and importunity of his friends, to which
he at length &s;urrendered, acquie&s;ced in the ju&s;tice
of their ob&s;ervations, and taking his &s;on by the
<PB N="173" REF="181">
hand, promi&s;ed to favour him for the future with
his love and fatherly protection.</P>
<P>But this laudable re&s;olution did not la&s;t; Mrs.
Pickle &s;till dubious of his con&s;tancy, and jealous
of his communication with the commodore, ne|ver
failed to interrogate him every night about
the conver&s;ation that happened at the club; and
regulate her exhortations according to the intelli|gence
&s;he received. He was no &s;ooner, therefore,
&s;a$ely conveyed to bed, (that academy in which
all notable wives communicate their lectures)
when her catechi&s;m began; and &s;he in a moment
perceived &s;ometing reluctant and equivocal in
her hu&s;band's an&s;wers. Arrou&s;ed at this di&s;covery,
&s;he employed her influence and &s;kill with &s;uch
&s;ucce&s;s, that he di&s;clo&s;ed every circum&s;tance of
what had happened; and after having &s;u&s;tained a
mo&s;t &s;evere rebuke for his &s;implicity and indi&s;cre|tion,
humbled him&s;elf &s;o far as to promi&s;e
that he would next day annul the conde&s;cen&s;ions
he had made, and for ever renounce the ungra|$$ous
object of her di&s;gu&s;t. This undertaking
was punctually performed in a letter to the com|modore,

</LETTER>
<P>This letter, which nothing but his pa&s;&s;ion and
inexperience could excu&s;e, had &s;uch an effect
upon his mother, as may be ea&s;ily conceived. She
was enraged to a degree of frenzy again&s;t the
writer; though at the &s;ame time &s;he con&s;idered
the whole as the production of Mrs. Trunnion's
particular pique, and repre&s;ented it to her hu&s;band
as an in&s;ult, that he was bound in honour to re|&s;ent,
by breaking off all corre&s;pondence with the
commodore and his family. This was a bitter
pill to Gamaliel, who, through a long cour&s;e of
years, was &s;o habituated to Trunnion's company,
that he could as ea&s;ily have parted with a limb,
as have relinqui&s;hed the club all at once. He
therefore ventured to repre&s;ent his own incapacity
to follow her advice, and begged that he might
at lea&s;t be allowed to drop the connexion gradu|ally;
<PB N="176" REF="184">
prote&s;ting that he would do his endeavour
to give her all manner of &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Mean while preparations were made for Pere|grine's
departure to the univer&s;ity, and in a few
weeks he &s;et out in the &s;eventeenth year of his
age, accompanied by the &s;ame attendants who
lived with him at Winche&s;ter, after his uncle
had laid &s;trong injunctions upon him to avoid the
company of mode&s;t women, to mind to mind his learn|ing,
to let him hear of his welfare as often as he
could &s;pare time to write, and had &s;ettled his ap|pointments
at the rate of five hundred a year, in|cluding
his governor's &s;alary, which was one fifth
part of the &s;um. The heart of our young gentlemen
dil$ted at the pro&s;pect of the figure he &s;hould make
with &s;uch an hand&s;ome annui$y, the management
of which was left to his own di&s;c$etion; and he
amu&s;ed his imagination with the mo&s;t agreeable
reveries during his journey to Oxford, which he
performed in two days. Here being introd$ced
to the head of the college, to whom he had been
recommended, accommodated with genteel apart|ments,
entered as gentleman commoner in
the books, and provided with a judicious tutor,
in&s;tead of returning to the &s;tudy of Greek and
Latin, in which he thought him&s;elf already &s;uffi|ciently
in&s;tructed; he renewed his acquaintance
with &s;ome of his old &s;chool-fellows, whom he
found in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and was by them ini|tiated
in all the fa&s;hionable diver&s;ions of the place.</P>
<P>It was not long before he made him&s;elf remark|able
for his &s;pirit and humour, which were &s;o
acceptable to the bucks of the univer&s;ity, that
he was admitted as a member of their corpora|tion,
and in a very little time became the mo&s;t
<PB N="177" REF="185">
con&s;picuous per&s;onage of the whole fraternity;
not that he valued him&s;elf upon his ability in
&s;moking the greate&s;t number of pipes, and drink|ing
the large&s;t quantity of ale; the&s;e were quali|fications
of too gro&s;s a nature to captivate his re|fined
ambition. He p$qued him&s;elf on his talent
for raillery, his genius and ta&s;te, his per&s;onal ac|compli&s;hments,
and his &s;ucce&s;s at intrigue; nor
were his excur&s;ions confined to the &s;mall villages
in the neighbourhood, which are commonly vi|&s;ited
once a week by the &s;tudents for the &s;ake of
carnal recreation. He kept his own hor&s;es, tra|ver&s;ed
the whole country in parties of plea&s;ure,
attended all the races within fifty miles of Oxford,
and made frequent jaunts to London, where he
u&s;ed to lie incognito during the be&s;t part of many
a term.</P>
<P>The rules of the university were too &s;e|vere
to be ob&s;erved by a youth of his vivacity;
and therefore he became acquainted with the
proctor, by times. But all the checks he re|ceived
were in&s;ufficient to moderate his career;
he frequented taverns and coffee-hou&s;es, com|mitted
midnight frolics in the &s;treets, in&s;ulted all
the &s;ober and pacific cla&s;s of his fellow-&s;tudents;
the tutors them&s;elves were not &s;acred from his
ridicule; he laughed at the magi&s;trate, and neg|lected
every particular of college-di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>In vain did they attempt to re&s;train his irre|gularities
by the impo&s;ition of fines; he was li|beral
to profu&s;ion, and therefore paid without
reluctance. Thrice did he &s;cale the windows of
a trade&s;man, with who&s;e daughter he had an af|fair
of gallantry, as often was he obliged to &s;eek his
&s;afety by a precipitate leap; and one night would,
in all probability, have fallen a &s;acrifice to an
<PB N="178" REF="186">
ambu&s;cade that was laid by the father, had not
his tru&s;ty &s;quire Pipes interpo&s;ed in his behalf,
and manfully re&s;cued him from the clubs of his
enemies.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, Mr. Jolter find|ing
his admonitions neglected, and his influence
utterly de&s;troyed, attempted to wean his pupil
from his extravagant cour&s;es, by engaging his at|tention
in &s;ome more laudable pur&s;uit. With
this view he introduced him into a club of po|liticians,
who received him with great demon|&s;trations
of regard, accommodated them&s;elves
more than he could have expected to his jovial
di&s;po&s;ition, and while they revolved &s;chemes for
the reformation of the &s;tate, drank with &s;uch de|votion
to the accompli&s;hment of their plans, that
before parting the cares of their patrioti&s;m were
quite overwhelmed.</P>
<P>Peregrine, though he could not approve of
their doctrine, re&s;olved to attach him&s;elf for &s;ome
time to their company; becau&s;e he perceived
ample &s;ubject for his ridicule, in the characters o$
the&s;e wrong-headed enthu&s;ia&s;ts. It was a con|&s;tant
practice with them, in their midnight con|&s;i&s;t$ries,
to &s;wallow &s;uch plentiful draughts $word$
in&s;piration, that their my&s;teries commonly ended
like tho&s;e of the Bacchanalian Orgia; and they
were &s;eldom capable of maintaining that &s;olem|nity
of decorum which by the nature of their
functions mo&s;t of them were obliged to profe&s;s.
Now as Peregrine's $span$ was never
more graitifi$d than when he had an opportunity
of expo&s;ing grave characters in ridiculous atti|tudes,
he laid a mi&s;chievous &s;nare for his new
confederates, which took effect in this manner.
In one of their nocturnal deliberations, he pro|moted
<PB N="179" REF="187">
&s;uch a &s;pirit of good fellow&s;hip, by the
agreeable &s;allies of his wit, which were purpo&s;ely
levelled again&s;t their political adver&s;aries, that by
ten o'clock they were all ready to join in the
mo&s;t extravagant propo&s;al that could be made.
They had already broke their gla&s;&s;es in con|&s;equence
of his &s;ugge&s;tion, drank healths out of
their &s;hoes, caps, and the bottoms of the candle|&s;ticks
that &s;tood before them, &s;ometimes &s;tanding
with one foot on a chair, and the knee bent on
the edge of the table; and when they could no
longer &s;tand in that po&s;ture, &s;etting their bare
po&s;teriors on the cold floor, they huzza'd, hol|lowed,
danced and &s;ung, and in &s;hort were ele|vated
to &s;uch a pitch of intoxication, that when
Peregrine propo&s;ed that they &s;hould burn their
perriwigs, the hint was immediately approved,
and they executed the frolick as one man; their
&s;hoes and caps underwent the &s;ame &s;ate by the
&s;ame in&s;tigation, and in this trim he led them
forth into the &s;treet, where they re&s;olved to com|pel
every body they &s;hould find to &s;ub&s;cribe to
their political creed, and pronounce the Shibo|leth
of their party. In the atchievement of this
enterprize, they met with more oppo&s;ition than
they expected; they were encountered with ar|guments
which they could not well with&s;tand;
the no&s;es of &s;ome, and eyes of others, in a very
little time bore the marks of ob&s;tinate di&s;puta|tion;
and their conductor having at length en|gaged
the whole body in a fray with another
&s;quadron which was pretty much in the &s;ame
condition, he very fairly gave them the &s;lip, and
&s;$$ly retreated to his apartment, fore&s;eeing that
his companions would &s;oon be favoured with the
notice of their &s;uperiors. Nor was he deceived
<PB N="180" REF="188">
in his progno&s;tic; the proctor going his round,
chanced to fall in with this tumultuous uproar,
and interpo&s;ing his authority, found means to
quiet the di&s;turbance, and, after having taken
cognizance of their names, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the rioters
to their re&s;pective chambers, not a little &s;canda|lized
at the behaviour of &s;ome among them,
who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s and duty it was to &s;et far other
examples to the youth under their care and di|rection.</P>
<P>About midnight Pipes, who had orders to at|tend
at a di&s;tance, and keep an eye upon Jolter,
brought home that unfortunate governor upon his
pack (Peregrine having beforehand &s;ecured his
admittance into the college) and among other
brui&s;es, he was found to have received a couple
of contu&s;ions on his face, which next morning
appeared in a black circle that &s;urrounded each
eye. This was a mortifying circum&s;tance to a
man of his character and deportment, e&s;pecially
as he had received a me&s;&s;age from the proctor,
who de&s;ired to &s;ee him forthwith. With great
humility and contrition he begged the advice of
his pupil, who being u&s;ed to amu&s;e him&s;elf with
painting, a&s;&s;ured Mr. Jolter, that he would co|ver
tho&s;e &s;igns of di&s;grace with a &s;light coat of
fle&s;h-colour, &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that it would be al|mo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the artificial from
the natural &s;kin. The rueful governor, rather
than expo&s;e &s;uch opprobrious tokens to the ob|&s;ervation
and cen&s;ure of the magi&s;trate, &s;ubmitted
to the expedient; and although his coun&s;ellor
had over-rated his own &s;kill, was per&s;uaded to
confide in the di&s;gui&s;e, and actually attended the
proctor, with &s;uch a &s;taring addition to the na|tural
gha&s;tline&s;s of his features, that his vi&s;age
<PB N="181" REF="189">
bore a very apt re&s;emblance to &s;ome of tho&s;e fe|rocious
countenances that hang over the doors of
certain taverns and alehou&s;es, under the denomi|nation
of the Saracen's head.</P>
<P>Such a remarkable alteration of phi&s;iognomy
could not e&s;cape the notice of the mo&s;t un|di&s;cerning
beholder, much le&s;s the penetrating
eye of this &s;evere judge, already whetted with
what he had &s;een over-night. He was therefore
upbraided with his ridiculous and &s;hallow artifice,
and, together with the companions of his de|bauch,
underwent &s;uch a cutting reprimand for
the &s;candalous irregularity of his conduct, that
all of them remained cre&s;t-fallen, and were
a&s;hamed, for many weeks, to appear in the pub|lick
execution of their duty.</P>
<P>Peregrine was too vain of his fine&s;&s;e, to con|ceal
the part he acted in this comedy, with the
particulars of which he regaled his companions,
and thereby intailed upon him&s;elf the hate and
re&s;entment of the community, who&s;e maxims
and practices he had di&s;clo&s;ed; for he was con|&s;idered
as a &s;py, who had intruded him&s;elf into
their &s;ociety with a view of betraying it; or, at
be&s;t, an apo&s;tate and renegado from the faith
and principles which he had profe&s;&s;ed.</P>

and in an excu$&s;ion to Wind&s;or meets with Emi|lia

<P>AMONG tho&s;e who &s;uffered by his craft
and infidelity was Mr. Jumble his own tu|tor,
who could not at all dige&s;t the mortifying
affront he had received, and was re&s;olved to be
revenged on the in&s;ulting author. With this
view he watched the conduct of Mr. Pickle with
the utmo&s;t rancour of vigilance, and let &s;lip no
opportunity of treating him with di&s;re&s;pect, wh$ch
he knew the di&s;po&s;ition of his pupil could le&s;s
brook than any other &s;everity it was in his power
to exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Peregrine had been &s;everal mornings ab&s;ent
from chapel; and as Mr. Jumble never failed
to que&s;tion him in a very peremptory &s;tile about
his non-at$endance, he invented &s;ome very plau|&s;ible
excu&s;es; but, at length, his ingenuity was
exhau&s;ted, he received a very galling rebuke for
his profl$gacy of morals, and that he might fe$l
it the more &s;en&s;ibly, was ordered, by way of
exerci&s;e, to compo&s;e a paraphra&s;e in Engli&s;h
$words$, upon the&s;e two lines in Virgil,</P>
<L>$word$ ligur, fru&s;traque animis elate &s;uperbis,</L>
<L>Necqui$quam, patrias, tenta&s;ti lubricus, artes.</L>
<P>The impo&s;ition of this invidious theme had
all the de&s;ired effect upon Peregrine, who not
only con&s;idered it as a piece of unmannerly abu&s;e
<PB N="183" REF="191">
levelled again&s;t his own conduct, but al&s;o as a
retro&s;pective in&s;ult on the memory of his grand|father,
who (as he had been informed) was in
his life-time more noted for his cunning than
candour in trade.</P>
<P>Exa&s;perated at this in&s;tance of the pedant's
audacity, he had well nigh (in his fir&s;t tran&s;|ports)
taken corporal &s;atisfaction on the &s;pot;
but fore&s;eeing the trouble&s;ome con&s;equences that
would attend &s;uch a flagrant outrage again&s;t the
laws of the univer&s;ity, he checked his indigna|tion,
and re&s;olved to revenge the injury in a
more cool and contemptuous manner. Thus
determined, he &s;et on foot an inquiry into the
particulars of Jumble's parentage and education,
and learnt that the father of this in&s;olent tutor
was a bri$klayer, and that his mother &s;old pies,
and that the &s;on, at different periods of his youth,
had amu&s;ed him&s;elf in both occupations, before
he conver$$d his views to the &s;tudy of learning.
Fraught with this intelligence, he compo&s;ed the

</LG>
<P>This impudent production was the mo&s;t effec|tual
vengeance he could have taken on his tutor,
who had all the &s;upercilious arrogance and ridi|culous
pride of a low-born pedant. In&s;tead of
overlooking this petulant piece of &s;atire with that
temper and decency of di&s;dain that became a per|&s;on
of his gravity and &s;tation, he no &s;ooner ca&s;t
his eye over the performance, than the blood ru&s;hed
into his countenance, which immediately after
exhibited a gha&s;tly pale colour, and with a qui|vering
lip he told his pupil that he was an imper|tinent
jackanapes, and he would take care that
he &s;hould be expelled from the univer&s;ity, for
having pre&s;umed to write and deliver &s;uch a licen|tious
and &s;currilous libel. Peregrine an&s;wered with
<PB N="185" REF="193">
great re&s;olution, that when the provocation he
had received &s;hould be known, he was per&s;uaded
that he &s;hould be acquitted by the opinion of all
impartial people; and that he was ready to &s;ub|mit
the whole to the deci&s;ion of the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>This arbitration he propo&s;ed, becau&s;e he knew
the ma&s;ter and Jumble were at variance; and for
that rea&s;on the tutor dur&s;t not venture to put the
cau&s;e on &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue. Nay, when this reference
was mentioned, Jumble, who was naturally jea|lous,
&s;u&s;pected that Peregrine had a promi&s;e of
protection before he undertook to commit &s;uch
an outrageous in&s;ult; and this notion had &s;uch an
effect upon him, that he re&s;olved to devour his
vexation, and wait for a more proper opportunity
of gratifying his hate. Mean while copies of the
ballad were di&s;tributed among the &s;tudents, who
&s;ung it under the very no&s;e of Mr. Jumble, to the
tune of a <HI>Cobler there was, &amp;c.</HI> and the triumph
of our hero was compleat. Neither was his whole
time devoted to the riotous extravagancies of
youth. He enjoyed many lucid intervals, during
which he contracted a more intimate acquaintance
with the cla&s;&s;icks, applied him&s;elf to the reading
of hi&s;tory, improved his ta&s;te for painting and
mu&s;ick, in which he made &s;ome progre&s;s; and
above all things, cultivated the &s;tudy of natural
philo&s;ophy. It was generally after a cour&s;e of
clo&s;e attention to &s;ome of the&s;e arts and &s;ciences,
that his di&s;po&s;ition broke out into tho&s;e irregulari|ties
and wild &s;allies of a luxuriant imagination,
for which he became &s;o remarkable; and he was
perhaps the only young man in Oxford, who at
the &s;ame time maintained an intimate and friendly
intercour&s;e with the mo&s;t unthinking, as well as
with the mo&s;t &s;edate &s;tudents at the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="194">
It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a young man of
Peregrine's vanity, inexperience and profu&s;ion,
could &s;uit his expence to his allowance, liberal as
it was; for he was not one of tho&s;e fortunate peo|ple
who are born oeconomi&s;ts, and knew not the
art of with-holding his pur&s;e when he &s;aw his
companion in difficulty: thus naturally generous
and expen&s;ive, he &s;quandered away his money, and
made a mo&s;t &s;plendid appearance upon the receipt
of his quarterly appointment; but long before the
third month was elap&s;ed, his finances were con|&s;umed,
and as he could not &s;toop to a&s;k an extra|ordinary
&s;upply, was too proud to borrow, and
too haughty to run in debt with trade&s;men, he
devoted tho&s;e periods of poverty to the pro&s;ecu|tion
of his &s;tudies, and &s;hone forth again at the
revolution of quarter day.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e irruptions he and &s;ome of his
companions went to Wind&s;or, in order to &s;ee the
royal apartmen$s in the ca&s;tle, whither they re|paired
in the afternoon, and as Peregrine &s;tood
contemplating the picture of Hercules and Om|phale,
one of this fellow-&s;tudents whi&s;pered in his
ear, &startq;Z&mdash;ds! Pickle, there are two fine girls.&endq;
He turned in&s;tantly about, and in one of them
recognize his almo&s;t forgotten Emilia: her ap|pearance
acted upon his imagination like a &s;park of
fire that falls among gun-powder; that pa&s;&s;ion
which had lain dormant for the &s;pace of two years
fla&s;hed up in a moment, and he was &s;eized with
an univer&s;al trepidation. She perceived and par|took
of his emotion; for their &s;ouls, like uni&s;ons,
vibrated with the &s;ame impul&s;e. However, &s;he
called her pride and re&s;$ntment to her aid, and
found re&s;olution enough to retire from &s;uch a dan|gerous
&s;cene. Alarmed at her retreat, he recol|lected
<PB N="187" REF="195">
all his a&s;&s;urance, and impelled by love
which he could no longer re&s;i&s;t, followed her into
the next room, where in the mo&s;t di&s;concerted
manner he acco&s;ted her with &startq;Your humble &s;er|vant,
Mi&s;s, Gauntlet;&endq; To which &s;alutation &s;he
replied, with an affectation of indifference that did
not, however, conceal her agitation, &startq;Your &s;er|vant,
Sir;&endq; and immediately extending her finger
towards the picture of Duns Scotus, which is
fixed over $word$ of the doors, a&s;ked her companion
in a &s;trange $ort of gi$gling tone&punc; if &s;he did not
think he looked like a conjurer. Peregrine net|tled
into &s;pirits by this reception, an&s;wered for
the othe$ lady, &startq;that it was an ea&s;y matter to be
a conjurer in tho&s;e times, when the &s;implicity of
the age a&s;&s;i&s;ted his divination; but were he, or
Merlin him&s;elf to ri&s;e from the dead now, when
&s;uch deceit and di&s;&s;imulation prevail, they would
no$ be able to earn their bread by the profe&s;&s;ion.&endq;
&startq;&mdash;O! Sir, &s;aid &s;he, (turning full upon him) with|out
doubt they would adopt new maxims; 'tis
no di&s;paragement in this enlightened age for one
to alter one's opinion.&endq; &startq;No &s;ure, Madam, re|plied
the youth with &s;ome precipitation, provided
the change be for the better;&endq; &startq;and &s;hould it
happen otherwi&s;e, retorted the nymph with a
flirt of her fan, incon&s;tancy will never want
countenance from the practice of mankind.&endq;
&startq;True, Madam, re&s;umed our hero, fixing his
eyes upon her, examples of levity are every where
to be met with.&endq; &startq;O Lord, Sir, cried Emilia,
to&s;&s;ing her head, you'll &s;carce ever find a fop
without it.&endq; By this time his companion &s;eeing
him engaged with one of the ladies, entered
into conver&s;ation with the other; and in order to
favour his friend's gallantry, conducted her into
<PB N="188" REF="196">
the next appartment, on pretence of entertaining
her with the &s;ight of a remarkable piece of paint|ing.</P>
<P>Peregrine laying hold on this opportunity of
being alone with the object of his love, a&s;&s;umed
a mo&s;t &s;educing tenderne&s;s of look, and heaving
a profound &s;igh, a&s;ked if &s;he had utterly di&s;carded
him from her remembrance. Reddening at this
pathetic que&s;tion, which recalled the memory of
the imagined &s;light he had put upon her, &s;he an|&s;wered
in great confu&s;ion, &startq;Sir, I believe I once
had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you at a ball in Win|che&s;ter.&endq;
&startq;Mi&s;s Emilia, &s;aid he, very gravely,
will you be &s;o candid as to tell me what mi&s;beha|viour
of mine you are plea&s;ed to puni&s;h, by re|&s;tricting
your remembrance to that &s;ingle occa|&s;ion?&endq;
&startq;Mr. Pickle, &s;he replied in the &s;ame
tone, it is neither my province nor inclination to
judge your conduct; and therefore your mi&s;apply
your que&s;tion when you a&s;k &s;uch an explanation
of me.&endq; &startq;At lea&s;t, re&s;umed our lover, give
me the melancholy &s;atisfaction to know for what
offence of my committing you refu&s;ed to take the
lea&s;t notice of that letter which I had the honour
to write from Winche&s;ter by your own expre&s;s
permi&s;&s;ion.&endq; &startq;Your letter, &s;aid Mi&s;s with great
vivacity, neither required, nor in my opinion,
de&s;erved an an&s;wer; and to be free with you,
Mr. Pickle, it was but a &s;hallow artifice to rid
your&s;elf of a corre&s;pondence you had deigned to
&s;ol$icit.&endq; Peregrine confounded at this repartee,
replied that how&s;oever he might have failed in
point of elegance or di&s;cretion, he was &s;ure he
had not been deficient in expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect
and devotion for tho&s;e charms which it was his
pride to $dore: &startq; As for the ver&s;es, &s;aid he, I
<PB N="189" REF="197">
own they were unworthy of the theme, but I
flattered my&s;elf that they would have merited your
acceptance, though not your approbation, and
been con&s;idered not &s;o much as the proof of my
genius, as the genuine effu&s;ion of my love.&endq;
&startq;Ver&s;es? cried Emilia with an air of a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
what ver&s;es? I really don't under&s;tand
you.&endq; The young gentleman was thunder&s;truck
at this exclamation, to which, after a long pau&s;e,
he an&s;wered, &startq;I begin to &s;u&s;pect, and heartily
wi&s;h it may appear that we have mi&s;under&s;tood
each other from the beginning. Pray, Mi&s;s
Gauntlet, did not you find a copy of ver&s;es in|clo&s;ed
in that unfortunate letter?&endq; &startq;Truly, Sir,
(&s;aid the lady) I am not &s;o much of a connoi&s;eru
as to di&s;tingui&s;h whether that facetious production
which you merrily &s;tile an unfortunate letter was
compo&s;ed in ver&s;e or pro&s;e; but, methinks, the
je&s;t is a little too &s;tale to be brought upon the car|pet
again.&endq; So &s;aying, &s;he tripped away to her
companion, and left her lover in a mo&s;t tumultu|ous
&s;u&s;pence. He now perceived that her neglect
of his addre&s;&s;es when he was at Winche&s;ter, mu&s;t
have been owing to &s;ome my&s;tery which he could
not comprehend; and &s;he began to &s;u&s;pect and to
hope that the letter which &s;he received was &s;pu|rious,
though &s;he could not conceive how that
could po&s;&s;ibly happen, as it had been delivered to
her by the hands of his own &s;ervant.</P>
<P>However, &s;he re&s;olved to leave the ta&s;k of un|ravelling
the affair, to him who, &s;he knew,
would infallibly exert him&s;elf for his own as well
as her &s;atisfaction. She was not deceived in her
opinion; he went up to her again at the &s;tair|ca&s;e,
and as they were unprovided with a male
attendant, in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;quiring the ladies to their
<PB N="190" REF="198">
lodgings. Emilia &s;aw his drift, which was no
other than to know where &s;he lived; and though
&s;he approved of his fine&s;&s;e, thought it was incum|bent
upon her for the &s;upport of her own dignity
to decline his civility: &s;he therefore thanked him
for his polite offer, but would by no means con|&s;ent
to his giving him&s;elf &s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary trouble,
e&s;pecially as they had a very little way to walk.
He was not repul&s;ed by this refu&s;al, the nature of
which he perfectly under&s;tood; nor was &s;he &s;orry
to &s;ee him per&s;evere in his determination; he
therefore accompanied them in their return, and
made divers efforts to &s;peak with Emilia in parti|cular:
but &s;he had a &s;pice of the coquette in her
di&s;po&s;ition, and being determined to whet his im|patience,
artfully baffled all his endeavours, by
keeping her companion continually engaged in the
conver&s;ation, which turned upon the venerable
appearance and imperial &s;ituation of the place.
Thus tantalized, he lounged with them to the
door of the hou&s;e in which they lodged, when his
mi&s;tre&s;s perceiving by the countenance of her
comrade, that &s;he was on the point of de&s;iring
him to walk in, checked her intention with a
frown, then turning to Mr. Pickle, dropped him
a very formal curt'&s;ey, &s;eized the other young
lady by the arm, and &s;aying &startq;Come, cou&s;in So|phy,&endq;

come to an explanation with his mi&s;tre&s;s; and a
rec$nciliation en&s;ues.</HEAD>
<P>PEregrine, di&s;concerted at their &s;udden di&s;|appearance,
&s;tood for &s;ome minutes gap|ing
in the &s;treet, before he could get the better
of his &s;urprize; and then deliberated with him&s;elf
whether he &s;hould demand immediate admittance
to his mi&s;tre&s;s, or choo&s;e &s;ome other method of
application. Piqued at her abrupt behaviour,
though plea&s;ed with her &s;pirit, he &s;et his inven|tion
to work, in order to contrive &s;ome means of
&s;eeing her; and in a fit of mu&s;ing arrived at the
inn, where he found his companions whom he
had left at the Ca&s;tle-gate. They had already
made inquiry about the ladies, in con&s;equence of
which, he learnt that Mi&s;s Sophy w$s daughter
of a gentleman in town to whom his mi&s;tre&s;s
was related; that an intimate friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
between the two young ladies; that Emilia had
lived about a month with her cou&s;in, and appeared
at the la&s;t a&s;&s;embly, where &s;he was univer&s;ally
admired; and that &s;everal young gentlemen of
fortune had &s;ince that time teized her with ad|dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Our hero's ambition was flattered, and his
pa&s;&s;ion inflamed with this intelligence; and he
&s;wore within him&s;elf that he would not quit the
&s;pot until he &s;hould have obtained an indi&s;puted
victory over all his rivals.</P>
<P>That &s;ame evening he compo&s;ed a mo&s;t elo|q$$nt
epi&s;tle, in which he earne&s;tly intreated that
<PB N="192" REF="200">
&s;he would favour him with an opportunity of vin|dicating
his conduct; but &s;he would neither re|ceive
his billet nor &s;ee his me&s;&s;enger. Baulked in
this effort, he inclo&s;ed it in a new cover directed
by another hand, and ordered Pipes to ride next
morning to London, on purpo&s;e to deliver it at
the po&s;t-office; that coming by &s;uch conveyance,
&s;he might have no &s;u&s;picion of the author, and
open it before &s;he &s;hould be aware of the deceit.</P>
<P>Three days he waited patiently for the effect
of this &s;tratagem, and in the afternoon of the
fourth, ventured to hazard a formal vi&s;it, in qua|lity
of an old acquaintance. But here too he
failed in his attempt; &s;he was indi&s;po&s;ed and could
not &s;ee company. The&s;e ob&s;tacles &s;erved only
to increa&s;e his eagerne&s;s; he &s;till adhered to his
former re&s;olution; and his companions under|&s;tanding
his determination, left him next day to
his own inventions. Thus relinqui&s;hed to his
own ideas, he doubled his a&s;&s;iduity, and practi&s;ed
every method his imagination could &s;ugge&s;t, in
order to promote his plan.</P>
<P>Pipes was &s;tationed all day long within &s;ight of
her door, that he might be able to give his ma&s;ter
an account of her motions; but &s;he never went
abroad except to vi&s;it in the neighbourhood, and
was always hou&s;ed before Peregrine could be ap|prized
of her appearance. He went to church
with a view of attracting her notice, and humbled
his deportment before her; but &s;he was &s;o mi&s;|chievou&s;ly
devout as to look at nothing but her
book, &s;o that he was not favoured with one
glance of regard. He frequented the coffee-hou&s;e,
and attempted to contract an acquaintance
with Mi&s;s Sophy's father, who, he hoped, would
invite him to his hou&s;e; but this expectation was
<PB N="193" REF="201">
al&s;o defeated. That prudent gentleman looked
upon him as one of tho&s;e forward fortune-hunters
who go about the country &s;eeking whom they
may devour, and warily di&s;couraged all his ad|vances.
Chagrined by &s;o many un&s;ucce&s;sful en|deavours,
he began to de&s;pair of accompli&s;hing
his aim, and as the la&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion of his art, paid
off his lodging, took hor&s;e at noon, and departed,
in all appearance, for the place from whence he
had come. He rode, however, but a few miles,
and in the du&s;k of the evening returned un&s;een,
alighted at another inn, ordered Pipes to &s;tay
within doors, and keeping him&s;elf incognito, em|ployed
another per&s;on as a centinel upon Emilia.</P>
<P>It was not long before he reaped the fruits of
his ingenuity. Next day in the afternoon he was
informed by his &s;py, that the two young ladies
were gone to walk in the park, whither he fol|lowed
them on the in&s;tant, fully determined to
come to an explanation with his mi&s;tre&s;s, even
in pre&s;ence of her friend, who might po&s;&s;ibly be
prevailed upon to intere&s;t her&s;elf in his behalf.</P>
<P>When he &s;aw them at &s;uch a di&s;tance that they
could not return to town before he &s;hould have
an opportunity of putting his re&s;olution in prac|tice,
he mended his pace, and found means to ap|pear
before them &s;o &s;uddenly, that Emilia could
not help expre&s;&s;ing her &s;urprize in a &s;cream. Our
lover putting on a mein of humility and mortifi|cation,
begged to know if her re&s;entment was
implacable; and a&s;ked why &s;he had &s;o cruelly re|fu&s;ed
to grant him the common privilege that
every criminal enjoyed. &startq;Dear Mi&s;s Sophy,
&s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her companion, give
me leave to implore your interce&s;&s;ion with your
cou&s;in; I am &s;ure you have humanity enough to
<PB N="194" REF="202">
e&s;pou&s;e my cau&s;e, did you but know the ju&s;tice of
it; and I flatter my&s;elf, that by your kind inter|po&s;ition,
I may be able to rectify that fatal mi&s;un|der&s;tanding
which hath made me wretched.&endq;
&startq;Sir, &s;aid Sophy, you appear like a gentleman,
and I doubt not but your behaviour has been al|ways
&s;uitable to your appearance; but you mu&s;t
excu&s;e me from undertaking any &s;uch office in
behalf of a per&s;on whom I have not the honour
to know.&endq; &startq;Madam, an&s;wered Peregrine, I
hope Mi&s;s Emy will ju&s;tify my preten&s;ions to that
character, notwith&s;tanding the my&s;tery of her
di&s;plea&s;ure, which upon my honour I cannot for
my &s;oul explain.&endq; &startq;Lord! Mr. Pickle, &s;aid
Emilia, (who had by this time recollected her&s;elf)
I never que&s;tioned your gallantry and ta&s;te, but I
am re&s;olved that you &s;hall never have cau&s;e to
exerci&s;e your talents at my expence; &s;o that you
teize your&s;elf and me to no purpo&s;e: come, So|phy,
let us walk home again.&endq; &startq;Good God!
Madam, (cried the lover with great emotion)
why will you di&s;tract me with &s;uch barbarous in|difference?
Stay, dear Emilia! I conjure you on
my knees to &s;tay and hear me: by all that is &s;acred!
I was not to blame, you mu&s;t have been
impo&s;ed upon by &s;ome villain who envied my good
fortune, and took &s;ome treacherous method to
ruin my love.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Sophy, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large &s;tock of
good nature, and to whom her cou&s;in had com|municated
the cau&s;e of her re&s;erve, &s;eeing the
young gentleman &s;o much affected with that di&s;|dain
which &s;he knew to be feigned, laid hold on
Emilia's &s;leeve, &s;aying with a &s;mile, &startq;Not quite
&s;o fa&s;t, Emily; I begin to perceive that this is a
love-quarrel, and therefore there may be hopes
<PB N="195" REF="203">
of a reconciliation; for I &s;uppo&s;e both parties are
open to conviction.&endq; &startq;For my own part, (cried
Peregrine with great eagerne&s;s) I appeal to Mi&s;s
Sophy's deci&s;ion. But why do I &s;ay appeal? Tho'
I am con&s;cious of having committed no offence,
I am ready to &s;ubmit to any penance, let it be
never &s;o rigorous, that my fair en&s;laver her&s;elf
&s;hall impo&s;e, provided it will intitle me to her
favour and forgivene&s;s at la&s;t.&endq; Emily well nigh
overcome by this declaration, told him that as
&s;he taxed him with no guilt, &s;he expected no at|tonement;
and pre&s;&s;ed her companion to return
into town. But Sophy, who was too indulgent
to her friend's real inclination to comply with her
reque&s;t, ob&s;erved that the gentleman &s;eemed &s;o
rea&s;onable in his conce&s;&s;ions, &s;he began to think
her cou&s;in was in the wrong, and felt her&s;elf di&s;|po&s;ed
to act as umpire in the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Overjoyed at this conde&s;cen&s;ion, Mr. Pickle
thanked her in the mo&s;t rapturous terms, and in
the tran&s;port of his expectation, ki&s;&s;ed the hand
of his kind mediatrix; a circum&s;tance which had
a remarkable effect on the countenance of Emi|lia,
who did not &s;eem to reli&s;h the warmth of his
acknowledgement.</P>
<P>After many &s;upplications on one hand, and
pre&s;&s;ing remon&s;trances on the other, &s;he yielded
at length, and turning to her lover, while her
face was over&s;pread with blu&s;hes, &startq;Well, Sir,
(&s;aid &s;he) &s;uppo&s;ing I were to put the difference
on that i&s;&s;ue, how could you excu&s;e the ridiculous
letter which you &s;ent to me from Winche&s;ter.&endq;
This expo&s;tulation introduced a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the
whole affair, in which all the circum&s;tances were
canva&s;&s;ed; and Emilia &s;till affirmed with great
heat, that the letter mu&s;t have been calculated to
<PB N="196" REF="204">
affront her; for &s;he could not &s;uppo&s;e the author
was &s;o weak as to de&s;ign it for any other purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who &s;till retained in his memory
the &s;ub&s;tance of this unlucky epi&s;tle, as well as
the ver&s;es which were inclo&s;ed, could recollect
no particular expre&s;&s;ion which could have ju&s;tly
given the lea&s;t umbrage; and therefore in the
agonies of perplexity, begged that the whole
might be &s;ubmitted to the judgment of Mi&s;s So|phy;
and faithfully promi&s;ed to &s;tand to her award.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this propo&s;al was with &s;eeming re|luctance
embraced by Emilia, and an appointment
made to meet next day in the &s;ame place, whi|ther
both parties were de&s;ired to come provided
with their credentials, according to which defini|tive
&s;entence would be pronounced.</P>
<P>Our lover having &s;ucceeded thus far, over|whelmed
Sophy with acknowledgements on account
of her generous mediation, and in the cour&s;e of
their walk, which Emilia was now in no hurry
to conclude, whi&s;pered a great many tender pro|te&s;tations
in the ear of his mi&s;tre&s;s, who, never|thele&s;s,
continued to act upon the re&s;erve, until
her doubts &s;hould be more fully re&s;olved.</P>
<P>Mr. Pickle having found means to amu&s;e them
in the fields till the twilight, was obliged to wi$h
them good even, after having obtained a &s;olemn
repetition of their promi&s;e to meet him at the
appointed time and place; and then retreated to
his apartment, where he &s;pent the whole night in
various conjectures on the &s;ubject of this letter,
the gordian knot of which he could by no means
untie.</P>
<P>One while he imagined that &s;ome wag had
played a trick upon his me&s;&s;enger, in con&s;equence
of which Emilia had received a &s;uppo&s;ititious letter;
<PB N="197" REF="205">
but upon further reflection, he could not conceive
the practicability of any &s;uch deceit. Then he
began to doubt the &s;incerity of his mi&s;tre&s;s who,
perhaps, had only made that an handle for di&s;|carding
him, at the reque&s;t of &s;ome favoured rival;
but his own integrity forbad him to harbour this
mean &s;u&s;picion; and therefore he was again in|volved
in the labyrinth of perplexity. Next day
he waited on the rack of impatience for the hour
of five in the afternoon, which no &s;ooner &s;truck,
than he ordered Pipes to attend him, in ca&s;e there
&s;hould be occa&s;ion for his evidence; and repaired
to the place of rendezvous, where he had not
tarried five minutes before the ladies appeared.
Mutual compliments being pa&s;&s;ed, and the at|tendant
&s;tationed at a convenient di&s;tance, Pere|grine
per&s;uaded them to &s;it down upon the gra&s;s,
under the &s;hade of a &s;preading oak, that they
might be more at their ea&s;e; while he &s;tretched
him&s;elf at their feet, and de&s;ired that the paper
on which his doom depended might be examined.
It was accordingly put into the hand of his fair
arbitre&s;s, who read it immediately with an audi|ble
voice. The fir&s;t two words of it were no
&s;ooner pronounced, than he &s;tarted with great
emotion, and rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his hand and
knee, in which po&s;ture he li&s;tened to the re&s;t of
the &s;entence; and then &s;prung upon his feet in
the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, and glowing with re|&s;entment
at the &s;ame time, exclaimed &startq;Hell and
the devil! what's all that? Sure you make a je&s;t
of me, madam.&endq; &startq;Pray, Sir, (&s;aid Sophy) give
me the hearing for a few moments, and then urge
what you &s;hall think proper in your own defence.&endq;
H$ving thus cautioned him, &s;he proceeded; but
before &s;he had fini&s;hed one half of the performance,
<PB N="198" REF="206">
her gravity for&s;ook her, and &s;he was &s;eized with
a violent fit of laughter, in which neither of the
lovers could help joining, notwith&s;tanding the
re&s;entment which at that in&s;tant prevailed in the
brea&s;ts of both. The judge, however, in a little
time, re&s;umed her &s;olemnity, and having read
the remaining part of this curious epi&s;tle, all three
continued &s;taring at each other alternately for the
&s;pace of half a minute, and then broke forth at
the &s;ame in&s;tant in another paroxi&s;m of mirth.
From this unanimous convul&s;ion, one would have
thought that both parties were extremely well
$word$ with the joke; yet this was by no means
the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Emilia imagined that notwith&s;tanding his af|fected
&s;urprize, her lover in &s;pite of him&s;elf had
renewed the laugh at her expence, and in &s;o do|ing,
applauded his own unmannerly ridicule. This
&s;uppo&s;ition could not not fail of rai&s;ing and reviv|ing
her indignation, while Peregrine highly re|&s;ented
the indignity with which he &s;uppo&s;ed him|&s;elf
treated, in their attempting to make him the
dupe of &s;uch a gro&s;s and ludicrous artifice. This
being the &s;ituation of their thoughts, their mirth
was &s;ucceeded by a mutual gloomine&s;s of a&s;pect,
and the judge addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Mr. Pickle,
a&s;ked if he had any thing to offer why &s;entence
&s;hould not be pronounced. &startq;Madam, an&s;wered
the culprit, I am &s;orry to find my&s;elf &s;o low in
the opinion of your cou&s;in, as to be thought ca|pable
of being deceived by &s;uch a &s;hallow con|trivance.&endq;
&startq;Nay, Sir, &s;aid Emily, the contri|vance
is your own, and I cannot help admiring
your confidence in imputing it to me.&endq; &startq;Upon
my honour, Mi&s;s Emily, re&s;umed our hero, you
wrong my under&s;tanding as well as my love, in
<PB N="199" REF="207">
accu&s;ing me of having written &s;uch a &s;illy imper|tinent
performance: the very appearance and ad|dre&s;s
of it is &s;o unlike the letter which I did my|&s;elf
the honour to write, that I dare &s;ay my man,
even at this di&s;tance of time, will remember the
difference.&endq; So &s;aying, he extended his voice,
and beckoned to Pipes, who immediately drew
near. His mi&s;tre&s;s &s;eemed to object to the evi|dence,
by ob&s;erving that to be &s;ure Mr. Pipes
had his cue; when Peregrine begging &s;he would
&s;pare him the mortification of con&s;idering him in
&s;uch a di&s;honourable light, de&s;ired his valet to
examine the out&s;ide of the letter, and recollect
if it was the &s;ame which he had delivered to Mi&s;s
Gauntlet about two years ago. Pipes having
taken a &s;uperficial view of it, pulled up his
breeches, &s;aying, &startq;Mayh$p it is, but we have
made &s;o many trips, and been in &s;o many creeks
and corners &s;ince that time, that I can't pretend
to be certain; for I neither keep journal nor log|book
of our proceedings.&endq; Emilia commended
him for his candour, at the &s;ame darting a &s;arca&s;t$c
look at his ma&s;ter, as if &s;he thought he had tam|pered
with his &s;ervant's integrity in vain; and Pe|regrine
began to rave and cur&s;e his fate for hav|ing
&s;ubjected him to &s;uch mean &s;u&s;picion, atte&s;t|ing
heaven and earth in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner,
that far from having compo&s;ed and conveyed that
&s;tupid production, he had never &s;een it before,
nor been privy to the lea&s;t circum&s;tance of the
plan.</P>
<P>Pipes, now for the fir&s;t time, perceived the
mi&s;chief which he had occa&s;ioned, and moved
with the tran&s;ports of his ma&s;ter, for whom he
had a mo&s;t inviolable attachment, frankly de|clared
he was ready to make oath that Mr. Pickle
<PB N="200" REF="208">
had no hand in the letter which he delivered.
All three were amazed at this confe&s;&s;ion, the
meaning of which they could not comprehend;
aud Peregrine after &s;ome pau&s;e, leaped upon Pipes,
and &s;eizing him by the throat, exclaimed in an
exta&s;y of rage, &startq;Ra&s;cal! tell me this in&s;tant
what became of the letter I intru&s;ted to your
care.&endq; The patient valet, half &s;trangled as he
was, &s;quirted a collection of tobacco juice out of
one corner of his mouth, and with great delibe|ration
replied, &startq;Why burnt it, you wouldn't
have me give the young woman a thing that
&s;hook all in the wind in tatters, would you?&endq;
The ladies interpo&s;ed in behalf of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
&s;quire, from whom, by dint of que&s;tions which
he had neither art nor inclination to evade, they
extorted an explanation of the whole affair.</P>
<P>Such ridiculous &s;implicity and innocence of in|tention
appeared in the compo&s;ition of his expe|dient,
that even the remembrance of all the cha|grin
which it had produced, could not rou&s;e their
indignation, or enable them to re&s;i&s;t a third erup|tion
of laughter which they forthwith underwent.</P>
<P>Pipes was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with many menacing in|junctions,
to beware of &s;uch conduct for the fu|ture;
Emilia &s;tood with a confu&s;ion of joy and
tenderne&s;s in her countenance; Peregrine's eyes
kindled into rapture, and when Mi&s;s Sophy pro|nounced
the &s;entence of reconciliation, advanced
to his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aying, &startq;Truth is mighty, and
will prevail;&endq; then cla&s;ping her in his arms, very
impudently ravi&s;hed a ki&s;s, which &s;he had not
power to refu&s;e. Nay, &s;uch was the impul&s;e of
his joy, that he took the &s;ame freedom with the
lips of Sophy, calling her his kind mediatrix and
guardian angel, and behaved with &s;uch extrava|gance
<PB N="201" REF="209">
of tran&s;port, as plainly evinced the fervour
and &s;incerity of his love.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pretend to repeat the tender prote&s;|tations
that were uttered on one &s;ide, or de&s;cribe
the bewitching glances of approbation with which
they were received on the other; &s;uffice it to
&s;ay, that the endearing intimacy of their former
connexion was in&s;tantly renewed, and Sophy,
who congratulated them upon the happy termi|nation
of their quarrel, favoured with their mu|tual
confidence. In con&s;equence of this happy
pacification, they deliberated upon the means of
&s;eeing each other often; and as he could not
without &s;ome previous introduction vi&s;it her
openly at the hou&s;e of her relation, they agreed
to meet every afternoon in the park till the next
a&s;&s;embly, at which he would &s;olicit her as a part|ner,
and &s;he be unengaged, in expectation of
his reque&s;t. By this connexion he would be in|titled
to vi&s;it her next day, and thus an avowed
corre&s;pondence would of cour&s;e commence. This
plan was actually put in execution, and attended
with a circum&s;tance which had well nigh pro|duced
&s;ome mi&s;chievous con&s;equence, had not Pe|regrine's
good fortune been &s;uperior to his di&s;cre|tion.</P>

<DIV2 N="27" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He atchieves an adventure at the a&s;&s;embly, and
quarrels with his governor.</HEAD>
<P>AT the a&s;&s;embly, were no fewer than three
gentlemen of fortune, who rivalled our
lover in his pa&s;&s;ion for Emilia, and who had &s;e|verally
begged the honour of dancing with her
<PB N="202" REF="210">
upon that occa&s;ion. She had excu&s;ed her&s;elf to
each, on pretence of a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition that &s;he
fore&s;aw would detain her from the ball, and de|&s;ired
they would provide them&s;elves with other
partners. Obliged to admit her excu&s;e, they ac|cordingly
followed her advice; and after they
had engaged them&s;elves beyond the power of re|tracting,
had the mortification to &s;ee her there
unclaimed.</P>
<P>They in their turns made up to her, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
their &s;urprize and concern at finding her
in the a&s;&s;embly unprovided, after &s;he had declined
their invitation; but &s;he told them that her cold
had for&s;aken her &s;ince &s;he had the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing
them, and that &s;he would rely upon accident
for a partner. Ju&s;t as &s;he pronounced the&s;e words
to the l$&s;t of the three, Peregrine advanced as an
utter &s;tranger, bowed with great re&s;pect, told her
he under&s;tood &s;he was di&s;engaged, and would
think him&s;elf highly honoured in being accepted
as her partner for the night; and had the good
fortune to &s;ucceed in his application.</P>
<P>As they were by far the hand&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t
accompli&s;hed couple in the room, they could not
fail of attracting the notice and admiration of the
&s;pectators, which inflamed the jealou&s;y of his
three competitors, who immediately entered into
a con&s;piracy again&s;t this gaudy &s;tranger, whom
as their rival, they re&s;olved to affront in publick.
Pur&s;uant to the plan which they projected for this
purpo&s;e, the fir&s;t country-dance was no &s;ooner
concluded, than one of them with his partner
took place of Peregrine and his mi&s;tre&s;s, contrary
to the regulations of the ball. Our lover imput|ing
this behaviour to inadvertency, informed the
gentleman of his mi&s;take, and civilly de&s;ired he
<PB N="203" REF="211">
would rectify his error. The other told him, in
an imperious tone, that he wanted none of his
advice, and bad him mind his own affairs. Pe|regrine
an&s;wered with &s;ome warmth, and in&s;i&s;ted
upon his right; a di&s;pute commenced, high words
en&s;ued, in the cour&s;e of which, our impetuous
youth hearing him&s;elf reviled with the appellation
of &s;coundrel, pulled off his antagoni&s;t's periwig,
and flung it in his face. The ladies immediately
&s;hriek'd, the gentlemen interpo&s;ed, Emilia was
&s;eized with a fit of trembling, and conducted to
her &s;eat by her youthful admirer, who begged
pardon for having di&s;compo&s;ed her, and vindi|cated
what he had done, by repre&s;enting the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
he was under to re&s;ent the provocation he
had received.</P>
<P>Though &s;he could not help owning the ju&s;tice
of his plea, &s;he was not the le&s;s concerned at the
dangerous &s;ituation in which he had involved
him&s;elf, and in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation and
anxiety, in&s;i&s;ted upon going directly home: he
could not re&s;i&s;t her importunities, and her cou&s;in
being determined to accompany her, he e&s;corted
them to their lodgings, where he wi&s;hed them
good night, after having, in order to quiet their
apprehen&s;ions, prote&s;ted that if his opponent was
&s;atisfied, he &s;hould never take any &s;tep towards
the prosecution of the quarrel. Mean while the
a&s;&s;embly-room became a &s;cene of tumult and up|roar;
the per&s;on who conceived him&s;elf injured,
&s;eeing Peregrine retire, &s;truggled with his com|panions
who with-held him, in order to pur&s;ue and
take &s;atisfaction of our hero, whom he loaded
with terms of abu&s;e, and challenged to &s;ingle
combat.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="212">
The director of the ball held a con&s;ultation
with all the &s;ub&s;cribers who were pre&s;ent, and it
was determined by a majority of votes, that the
two gentlemen who had occa&s;ioned the di&s;turb|ance,
&s;hould be de&s;ired to withdraw. This re&s;o|lution
being &s;ignified to one of the parties then
pre&s;ent, he made &s;ome difficulty of complying,
but was per&s;uaded to &s;ubmit by his two confede|rates,
who accompanied him to the &s;treet-door,
where he was met by Peregrine on his return to
the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>This choleric gentleman, who was a country
&s;quire, no &s;ooner &s;aw his rival, than he began to
brandi&s;h his cudgel in a menacing po&s;ture, when
our adventurous youth &s;tepping back with one foot,
laid his hand upon the hilt of his &s;word, which he
drew half way out of the &s;cabbard. This attitude,
and the &s;ight of the blade which glittened by
mo$nl$ght in his face, checked in &s;ome &s;ort, the
ardour of his a&s;&s;ailant, who de&s;ired he would lay
a&s;ide his toa&s;ter, and take a bout with him at
equal arms. Peregrine, who was an expert
cudgel-player, accepted the invitation, and ex|changing
weapons with Pipes who &s;tood behind
him, put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence, and
received the attack of his adver&s;ary, who &s;truck
at random without either &s;kill or oeconomy. Pic|kle
could have beaten the cudgel out of his hand
at the fir&s;t blow, but as in that ca&s;e he would
have been obliged in honour to give imme|diate
quarter, he re&s;olved to di&s;cipline his anta|goni&s;t
without endeavouring to di&s;able him until
he &s;hould be heartily &s;atisfied with the vengeance
he had taken. With this view he returned the
&s;alute, and rai&s;ed &s;uch a clatter about the &s;quire's
pate, that one who had heard without &s;eeing the
<PB N="205" REF="213">
application, would have mi&s;taken the &s;ound for
that of a &s;alt-box, in the hand of a dext'rous
Merry Andrew, belonging to one of the booths at
Bartholomew Fair. Neither was this &s;alutation
confined to his head; his &s;houlders, arms, thighs,
ancles and ribs, were vi&s;ited with amazing rapi|dity,
while Tom Pipes &s;ounded the charge through
his fi&s;t. Peregrine tired-with this exerci&s;e, which
had almo&s;t bereft his enemy of &s;en&s;ation, at la&s;t
&s;truck the deci&s;ive blow, in con&s;equence of which,
the &s;quire's weapon flew out of his gra&s;p, and he
allowed our hero to be the better man. Satisfied
with this acknowledgment, the victor walked up
&s;tairs with &s;uch elevation of &s;pirits and in&s;olence
of mein, that no body cho&s;e to intimate the re|&s;olution
which had been taken in his ab&s;ence, and
having amu&s;ed him&s;elf for &s;ome time in beholding
the country dances, he retreated to his lodging,
where he indulged him&s;elf all night in the con|templation
of his own &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Next day in the forenoon he went to vi&s;it his
partner, and the gentleman at who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he
lived, having been informed of his family and
condition, received him with great courte&s;y, as
the acquaintance of his cou&s;in Gauntlet, and in|vited
him to dinner that &s;ame day.</P>
<P>Emilia was remarkably well plea&s;ed, when &s;he
under&s;tood the i&s;&s;ue of his adventure, which be|gan
to make &s;ome noi&s;e in town, even though it
deprived her of a wealthy admirer; for the &s;quire
having con&s;ulted an attorney about the nature of
the di&s;pute, in hopes of being able to pro&s;ecute
Peregrine for an a&s;&s;ault, and finding little encou|ragement
to go to law, re&s;olved to pocket the
in&s;ult and injury he had undergone, and to di&s;|continue
<PB N="206" REF="214">
his addre&s;&s;es to her who was the cau&s;e
of both.</P>
<P>Our lover being told by his mi&s;tre&s;s that &s;he
porpo&s;ed to &s;tay a fortnight longer at Wind&s;or,
determined to enjoy her company all that time,
and then to give her a convoy to the hou&s;e of her
mother, whom he longed to &s;ee. In con&s;equence
of this plan, he every day contrived &s;ome fre&s;h
party of plea&s;ure for the ladies, to whom he had
by this time free acce&s;s; and intangled him&s;elf &s;o
much in the &s;nares of love, that he &s;eemed quite
enchanted by Emilia's charms, which were now
indeed almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible. While he thus heed|le&s;sly
roved in the flowery paths of plea&s;ure, his
governor at Oxford alarmed at the unu&s;ual dura|tion
of his ab&s;ence, went to the young gentlemen
who had accompanied him in his excur&s;ion, and
very earne&s;tly intreated them to tell him what
they knew concerning his pupil; they accordingly
gave him an account of the rencounter that hap|pened
between Peregrine and Mi&s;s Emily Gaunt|let
in the ca&s;tle, and mentioned circum&s;tances
&s;ufficient to convince him that his charge was very
dangerou&s;ly engaged.</P>
<P>Far from having an authority over Peregrine,
Mr. Jolter dur&s;t not even di&s;oblige him, and
therefore, in&s;tead of writing to the commodore,
he took hor&s;e immediately, and that &s;ame night
reached Wind&s;or, where he found his &s;tray &s;heep
very much &s;urpri&s;ed at his unexpected arrival.</P>
<P>The governor de&s;iring to have &s;ome &s;erious
conver&s;ation with him, they &s;hut them&s;elves up
in an apartment, when Jolter with great &s;olem|nity,
communicated the cau&s;e of his journey,
which was no other than his concern for his pu|pil's
welfare; and very gravely undertook to
<PB N="207" REF="215">
prove by mathematical demon&s;tration, that this
intrigue, if further pur&s;ued, would tend to the
young gentleman's ruin and di&s;grace. This &s;in|gular
propo&s;ition to rai&s;ed the curio&s;ity of Peregrine,
who promi&s;ed to yield all manner of attention,
and de&s;ired him to begin without further pream|ble.</P>
<P>The governor, encouraged by this appearance
of candour, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction in finding
him &s;o open to conviction, and told him he
would proceed upon geometrical principles. Then
hemming thrice, ob&s;erved, that no mathematical
inquiries could be carried on, except upon certain
<HI>data,</HI> or conce&s;&s;ions to truths, that were &s;elf-evident;
and therefore he mu&s;t crave his a&s;&s;ent
to a few axioms, which he was &s;ure Mr. Pickle
would &s;ee no rea&s;on to di&s;pute. &startq;In the fir&s;t
place then (&s;aid he) you will grant, I hope, that
youth and di&s;cretion are with re&s;pect to each
other as two parallel lines, which though infi|nitely
produced, remain &s;till equi-di&s;tant, and
will never coincide: then you mu&s;t allow that
pa&s;&s;ion acts upon the human mind, in a ratio
compounded of the acutene&s;s of &s;en&s;e, and con|&s;titutional
heat: and thirdly, you will not deny
that the angle of remor&s;e is equal to that of pre|cipitation.
The&s;e <HI>po&s;tulata</HI> being admitted,
(added he, taking paper, pen and ink, and draw|ing
a parallelogram) let youth be repre&s;ented by
the right line <HI>a, b,</HI> and d$&s;$retion by another right
line <HI>c, d,</HI> parallel to the former. Compleat the
par$llelogram <HI>a, b, c, d,</HI> and let the point of in|ter&s;ection,
<HI>b,</HI> repre&s;ent perdition. Let pa&s;&s;ion,
repre&s;ented under the letter <HI>c,</HI> have a motion in
the direction <HI>c, a.</HI> At the &s;ame time, let another
motion be communicated to it, in the direction
<PB N="208" REF="216">
<HI>c, d,</HI> it will proceed in the diagonal <HI>c, b,</HI> and
de&s;cribe it in the &s;ame time that it would have
de&s;cribed the &s;ide <HI>c, a,</HI> by the fir&s;t motion, or
the &s;ide <HI>c, d,</HI> by the &s;econd. To under&s;tand
the demon&s;tration of this corollary, we mu&s;t
premi&s;e this obvious principle, that when a body
is acted upon by a motion or power parallel to a
right line given in po&s;ition, this power, or mo|tion,
has no effect to cau&s;e the body to approach
towards that line, or recede from it, but to
move in a line parallel to a right line only; as
appears from the &s;econd law of motion: there|fore
<HI>c, a,</HI> being parallel to <HI>d, b,</HI>&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>His pupil having li&s;tened to him thus far,
could contain him&s;elf no longer, but interrupted
the inve&s;tigation with a loud laugh, and told him
that his <HI>po&s;tulata</HI> put him in mind of a certain
learned and ingenious gentleman, who under|took
to di&s;prove the exi&s;tence of natural evil,
and a&s;ked no other <HI>datum</HI> on which to found his
demon&s;tration, but an acknowledgment that <HI>every
thing that is, is right.</HI> &startq;You may therefore
(&s;aid he, in a peremptory tone) &s;pare your&s;elf
the trouble of torturing your invention; for,
after all, I am pretty certain that I &s;hall want
capacity to comprehend the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of your
lemma, and con&s;equently be obliged to refu&s;e
my a&s;&s;ent to your deduction.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter was di&s;concerted at this declaration,
and &s;o much offended at Peregrine's di&s;re&s;pect,
that he could not help expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;plea&s;ure,
by telling him flatly, that he was too violent and
head&s;trong to be reclaimed by rea&s;on and gentle
means; that he (the tutor) mu&s;t be obliged in
the di&s;charge of his duty and con&s;cience, to in|form
the commodore of his nephew's imprudence;
<PB N="209" REF="217">
that if the laws of this realm were effectual, they
would take cognizance of the gip&s;y who had led
him a&s;tray; and ob&s;erved, by way of contra&s;t,
that if &s;uch a prepo&s;terous intrigue had happened
in France, &s;he would have been clapt up in a convent
two years ago.</P>
<P>Our lover's eyes kindled with indignation,
when he heard his mi&s;tre&s;s treated with &s;uch ir|reverence;
he could &s;carce refrain from inflict|ing
manual cha&s;ti&s;ement on the bla&s;phemer,
whom he reproached in his wrath as an arrogant
pedant, without either delicacy or &s;en&s;e, and cau|tioned
him again&s;t u&s;ing any &s;uch impertinent
freedoms with his affairs for the future, on pain
of incurring more &s;evere effects of his re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter, who entertained very high no|tions
of that veneration to which he thought
him&s;elf intitled by his character and qualifica|tions,
had not bore without repining, his want of
influence and authority over his pupil, again&s;t
whom he cheri&s;hed a particular grudge, ever
&s;ince the adventure of the painted eye; and
therefore, on this occa&s;ion, his political forbear|ance
had been overcome by the accumulated mo|tives
of his di&s;gu&s;t. Indeed he would have re|&s;igned
his charge with di&s;dain, had not he been
encouraged to per&s;evere, by the hopes of a good
living which Trunnion had in his gift, or known
how to di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf for the pre&s;ent to better
advantage.</P>

<P>MEAN while he quitted the youth in
high dudgeon, and that &s;ame evening
di&s;patched a letter for Mrs. Trunnion, which
was dictated by the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his pa&s;&s;ion,

<P>In con&s;equence of this complaint, it was not
long before Peregrine received an epi&s;tle from
his aunt, wherein &s;he commemorated all the cir|cum&s;tances
of the commodore's benevolence to|wards
him, when he was helple&s;s and forlorn,
de&s;erted and abandoned by his own parents, up|braided
him for his mi&s;behaviour and neglect of

off all intercour&s;e with that girl who had &s;educed
his youth, as he valued the continuance of her

<P>As our lover's own ideas of genero&s;ity were

</LETTER>
<P>Peregrine was equally piqued and di&s;concerted
at the receit of this letter, which was quite dif|ferent
from what he had expected, and declared
in a re&s;olute tone to the lieutenant, who brought
it, that he might return as &s;oon as he plea&s;ed;
for he was determined to con&s;ult his own incli|nation,
and remain for &s;ome time longer where
he was.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="221">
Hatchway endeavoured to per&s;uade him by all
the arguments which his &s;agacity and friend&s;hip
could &s;upply, to &s;hew a little more deference for
the de&s;ire of the old man, who was by this time
rendered fretful and peevi&s;h by the gout, which
now hindered him from enjoying him&s;elf as u&s;ual,
and who might, in his pa&s;&s;ion, take &s;ome &s;tep
very much to the detriment of the young gen|tleman,
whom he had hitherto con&s;idered as his
own &s;on. Among other remon&s;trances, Jack
ob&s;erved that mayhap Peregrine had got under
Emilia's hatches, and did not choo&s;e to &s;et her
adrift; and if that was the ca&s;e, he him&s;elf would
take charge of the ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ee her cargo &s;afely
delivered; for he had a re&s;pect for the young
woman, and his needle pointed towards matri|mony;
and as, in all probability, &s;he could not
be much the wor&s;e for the wear, he would make
&s;hift to &s;cud thro' life with her under an ea&s;y
&s;ail.</P>
<P>Our lover was deaf to all his admonitions,
and having thanked him for this la&s;t in&s;tance of
his complai&s;ance, repeated his re&s;olution of ad|hering
to his fir&s;t purpo&s;e. Hatchway having
profited &s;o little by mild exhortations, a&s;&s;umed a
more peremptory a&s;pect, and plainly told him he
neither could nor would go home without him;
&s;o he had be&s;t make immediate preparation for
the voyage.</P>
<P>Peregrine made no other reply to this decla|ration
than by a contemptuous &s;mile, and ro&s;e
from his &s;eat in order to retire; upon which the
lieutenant &s;tarted up, and po&s;ting him&s;elf by
the door, prote&s;ted with &s;ome menacing ge&s;tures,
that he would not &s;uffer him to run a-head nei|ther.
The other, incen&s;ed at his pre&s;umption
<PB N="214" REF="222">
in attempting to detain him by force, tripped up
his wooden leg, and laid him on his back in a
moment; then walked deliberately towards the
park, in order to indulge his reflection, which at
that time teemed with di&s;agreeable thoughts. He
had not proceeded two hundred &s;teps, when he
heard &s;omething blowing and &s;tamping behind him;
and looking back, perceived the lieutenant at his
heels, with rage and indignation in his coun|tenance.
This exa&s;perated &s;eaman, impatient of
the affront he had received, and forgetting all
the circum&s;tances of their former intimacy, ad|vanced
with great eagerne&s;s to his old friend,
&s;aying, &startq;Look ye, brother, you're a &s;aucy boy,
and if you was at &s;ea, I would have your ar&s;e
brought to the David for your di&s;obedience; but
as we are on &s;hore, you and I mu&s;t crack a pi&s;tol
at one another; here is a brace, you &s;hall take
which you plea&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Peregrine, upon recollection, was &s;orry for
having been laid under the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;obliging
hone&s;t Jack, and very frankly a&s;ked his pardon
for what he had done. But this conde&s;cen&s;ion
was mi&s;interpreted by the other, who refu&s;ed any
other &s;atisfaction but that which an officer ought
to claim; and, with &s;ome irreverent expre&s;&s;ions,
a&s;ked if Perry was afraid of his bacon. The
youth, inflamed at this unju&s;t in&s;inuation, darted
a ferocious look at the challenger, told him he
had paid but too much regard to his infirmities,
and bad him walk forward to the park, where
he would &s;oon convince him of his error, if he
thought his conce&s;&s;ion proceeded from fear.</P>
<P>About this time, they were overtaken by
Pipes, who having heard the lieutenant's fall,
and &s;een him pocket his pi&s;tols, &s;u&s;pected that
<PB N="215" REF="223">
there was a quarrel in the ca&s;e, and followed
him with a view of protecting his ma&s;ter. Pere|grine
&s;eeing him arrive, and gue&s;&s;ing his inten|tion,
a&s;&s;umed an air of &s;erenity, and pretending
that he had left his handkerchief at the inn, or|dered
his man to go thither and fetch it to him
in the park, where he would find them at his re|turn.
This command was twice repeated be|fore
Tom would take any other notice of the
me&s;&s;age, except by &s;haking his head: but being
urged with many threats and cur&s;es to obedience,
he gave them to under&s;tand that he knew their
drift too well to tru&s;t them by them&s;elves. &startq;As
for you, lieutenant Hatchway (&s;aid he) I have
been your &s;hip-mate, and know you to be a &s;ai|lor,
that's enough; and as for ma&s;ter, I know
him to be as good a man as ever &s;tept betwixt
&s;tem and &s;tern, whereby, if you have any thing
to &s;ay to him, I am your man, as the &s;aying is.
Here's my &s;apling, and I don't value your crackers
of a rope's end.&endq; This oration, the longe&s;t that
ever Pipes was known to make, he concluded
with a flouri&s;h of his cudgel, and enforced with
&s;uch determined refu&s;als to leave them, that
they found it impo&s;&s;ible to bring the cau&s;e to
mortal arbitrement at that time, and &s;trolled
about the park in profound &s;ilence; during
which, Hatchway's indignation &s;ub&s;iding, he all
of a &s;udden thru&s;t out his hand as an advance to
reconciliation, which being cordially &s;haken by
Peregrine, a general pacification en&s;ued; and
was followed by a con&s;ultation about the means
of extricating the youth from his pre&s;ent per|plexity.
Had his di&s;po&s;ition been like that of
mo&s;t other young men, it would have been no
difficult ta&s;k to overcome his difficulties; but
<PB N="216" REF="224">
&s;uch was the ob&s;tinacy of his pride, that he
deemed him&s;elf bound in honour to re&s;ent the
letters he had received; and, in&s;tead of &s;ub|mitting
to the plea&s;ure of the commodore, ex|pected
an acknowledgment from him, without
which he would li&s;ten to no terms of accommo|dation.
&startq;Had I been his own &s;on (&s;aid he) I
&s;hould have bore his reproof, and &s;ued for for|givene&s;s;
but knowing my&s;elf to be on the
footing of an orphan who depends entirely upon
his benevolence, I am jealous of every thing
that can be con&s;trued into di&s;re&s;pect, and in&s;i&s;t
upon being treated with the mo&s;t punctual re|gard.
I &s;hall now make application to my fa|ther,
who is obliged to provide for me by the
ties of nature, as well as the laws of the land;
and if he &s;hall refu&s;e to do me ju&s;tice, I can
never want employment while men are required
for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.&endq;</P>
<P>The lieutenant, alarmed at this intimation,
begged he would take no new &s;tep, until he
&s;hould hear from him; and that very evening
&s;et out for the gari&s;on, where he gave Trunnion
an account of the mi&s;carriage of his negotiation,
told him how highly Peregrine was offended at
the letter, communicated the young gentleman's
&s;entiments and re&s;olution; and finally a&s;&s;ured
him, that unle&s;s he &s;hould think proper to a&s;k
pardon for the offence he had committed, he
would, in all appearance, never more behold
the face of his god&s;on.</P>
<P>The old commodore was utterly confounded
at this piece of intelligence; he had expected
all the humility of obedience and contrition from
the young man; and in&s;tead of that, received
nothing but the mo&s;t indignant oppo&s;ition, and
<PB N="217" REF="225">
even found him&s;elf in the predicament of an of|fender,
obliged to make atonement, or forfeit
all corre&s;pondence with his favourite. The&s;e
in&s;olent conditions at fir&s;t threw him into an
agony of wrath, and he vented execrations with
&s;uch rapidity, that he left him&s;elf no time to
breathe, and had almo&s;t been &s;uffocated with his
choler. He inveighed bitterly again&s;t the ingra|titude
of Peregrine, whom he mentioned with
many opprobrious epithets, and &s;wore that he
ought to be keel-hauled for his pre&s;umption;
but when he began to reflect more coolly upon
the &s;pirit of the young gentleman, which had al|ready
manife&s;ted it&s;elf on many occa&s;ions, and
li&s;tened to the &s;ugge&s;tions of Hatchway, whom
he had always con&s;idered as an oracle in his
way, his re&s;entment abated, and he determined
to take Perry into favour again; this plac$bility
being not a little facilitated by Jack's narrative
of our hero's intrepid behaviour at the a&s;&s;embly,
as well as in the conte&s;t with him in the park.
But &s;till this plaguy amour occurred like a bug|bear
to his imagination; for he held it as an in|fallible
maxim, that woman was an eternal &s;ource
of mi&s;ery to man. Indeed this apothegm he &s;el|dom
repeated &s;ince his marriage, except in the
company of a very few intimates, to who&s;e &s;e|crecy
and di&s;cretion he could tru&s;t. Finding
Jack him&s;elf at a nonplus in the affair of Emilia,
he con&s;ulted Mrs. Trunnion, who was equally
&s;urpri&s;ed and offended, when &s;he under&s;tood that
her letter did not produce the de&s;ired effect; and
after having imputed the youth's obstinacy to his
uncle's un&s;ea&s;onable indulgence, had recour&s;e to
the advice of the par&s;on, who, &s;til with an eye
to his friend's advantage, coun&s;elled them to &s;end
<PB N="218" REF="226">
the young gentleman on his travels, in the cour&s;e
of which he would, in all probability, forget the
amu&s;ements of his greener years. The propo&s;al
was judicious, and immediately approved, when
Trunnion going into his clo&s;et, after divers ef|forts,
produced the following billet, with which
Jack departed for Wind&s;or that &s;ame afternoon.</P>

<P>PEregrine, fortified as he was with pride and
indignation, did not fail to feel the &s;mart|ing
&s;ugge&s;tions of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation: after
having lived &s;o long in an affluent and imperious
manner, he could ill brook the thoughts of &s;ub|mitting
<PB N="219" REF="227">
to the mortifying exigencies of life;
all the gaudy &s;chemes of pomp and plea&s;ure,
which his luxuriant imagination had formed, be|gan
to di&s;&s;olve; a train of melancholy ideas took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his thoughts, and the pro&s;pect of
lo&s;ing Emilia was not the lea&s;t part of his afflic|tion.
Though he endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s the
chagrin that preyed upon his heart, he could not
conceal the di&s;turbance of his mind from the
penetration of that amiable young lady, who
&s;ympathized with him in her heart, though &s;he
could not give her tongue the liberty of a&s;king
the cau&s;e of his di&s;order; for, notwith&s;tanding
all the ardour of his addre&s;&s;es, he never could
obtain from her the declaration of a mutual
flame; becau&s;e, tho' he had hitherto treated her
with the utmo&s;t reverence of re&s;pect, he had ne|ver
once mentioned the final aim of his pa&s;&s;ion;
and however honourable &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be,
&s;he had di&s;cernment enough to fore&s;ee, that va|nity
or intere&s;t co-operating with the levity of
youth, might one day deprive her of her lover,
and &s;he was too proud to give him any handle of
exulting at her expence; &s;o that, although he was
received by her with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed civility,
and even an intimacy of friend&s;hip, all his &s;olli|citations
could never extort from her an acknow|ledgment
of love; on the contrary, being of a
gay di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he &s;ometimes coquetted with
other admirers, that his attention thus whetted
might never abate, and that he might &s;ee &s;he
had other re&s;ources, in ca&s;e he &s;hould flagg in
his affection.</P>
<P>This being the prudential plan on which &s;he
acted, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he would con|de&s;cend
to inquire into the &s;tate of his thoughts,
<PB N="220" REF="228">
when &s;he &s;aw him thus affected; but &s;he, ne|verthele&s;s,
impo&s;ed that ta&s;k on her cou&s;in and
confidan$e, who, as they walked together in the
park, ob&s;erved that he &s;eemed to be out of hu|mour.
When this is the ca&s;e, &s;uch a que&s;tion
generally increa&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e; at lea&s;t it had
that effect upon Peregrine, who replied &s;omewhat
peevi&s;hly, &startq;I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, you never
was more mi&s;taken in your ob&s;ervations.&endq; &startq;I
think &s;o too (&s;aid Emilia) for I never &s;aw Mr.
Pickle in higher &s;pirits.&endq; This ironical enco|mium
completed his confu&s;ion; he affected to
&s;mile, but it was a &s;mile of angui&s;h, and in his
heart cur&s;ed the vivacity of both. He could not
for his &s;oul recollect him&s;elf, &s;o as to utter one
connected &s;entence; and the &s;u&s;picion that they
ob&s;erved every circum&s;tance of his behaviour,
threw &s;uch a damp on his &s;pirits, that he was
quite overwhelmed with &s;hame and re&s;entment,
when Sophy ca&s;ting her eyes towards the gate,
&s;aid, &startq;Yonder is your &s;ervant, Mr. Pickle, with
another man who &s;eems to have a wooden leg.&endq;
Peregrine &s;tarted at this intelligence, and imme|diately
underwent &s;undry changes of complexion,
knowing that his fate, in a great mea&s;ure, de|pended
upon the information he would receive
from his friend.</P>
<P>Hatchway advancing to the company, after a
brace of &s;ea-bows to the ladies, took the youth
a&s;ide, and put the commodore's letter into his
hand, which threw him into &s;uch an agitation,
that he could &s;carce pronounce, &startq;Ladies, will
you give me leave?&endq; And when, in con&s;e|quence
of their permi&s;&s;ion, he attempted to open
the billet, he fumbled with &s;uch manife&s;t di&s;order,
that his mi&s;tre&s;s, who watched his motions, be|gan
<PB N="221" REF="229">
to think there was &s;omething very intere&s;ting
in the me&s;&s;age; and &s;o much was &s;he affected
with his concern, that &s;he was fain to turn her
head another way, and wipe the tears from her
lovely eyes.</P>
<P>Mean while, Peregrine no &s;ooner read the fir&s;t
&s;entence, than his countenance, which before was
overca&s;t with a deep gloom, began to be lighted
up, and every feature unbending by degrees, he
recovered his &s;erenity; and having peru&s;ed the
letter, his eyes &s;parkling with joy and gratitude,
he hugged the lieutenant in his arms, and pre|&s;ented
him to the ladies as one of his be&s;t friends.
Jack met with a mo&s;t gracious reception, and
&s;hook Emilia by the hand, telling her, with the
familiar appellation of <HI>old acquaintance,</HI> that he
did not care how &s;oon he was ma&s;ter of &s;uch an|other
clean-going frigate as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The whole company partook of this favour|able
change that evidently appeared in our lover's
recollection, and enlivened his conver&s;ation with
&s;uch an uncommon flow of &s;prightline&s;s and good
humour, as even made an impre&s;&s;ion on the iron
countenance of Pipes him&s;elf, who actually
&s;miled with &s;atisfaction as he walked behind
them.</P>
<P>The evening being pretty far advanced, they
directed their cour&s;e homeward; and while the
valet attended Hatchway to the inn, Peregrine
e&s;corted the ladies to their lodgings, where he
owned the ju&s;tne&s;s of Sophy's remark, in &s;aying
he was out of humour, and told them he had
been extremely chagrined at a difference which
happened between him and his uncle, to whom
(by the letter which they had &s;een him receive)
he now found him&s;elf happily reconciled.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="230">
Having received their congratulations, and de|clined
&s;taying to &s;up with them, on account of
the longing de&s;ire he had to conver&s;e with his
friend Jack, he took his leave, and repaired to
the inn, where Hatchway informed him of every
thing that had happened in the gari&s;on upon his
repre&s;entations; and far from being di&s;gu&s;ted, he
was perfectly well plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of
going abroad, which flattered his vanity and am|bition,
gratified his thir&s;t after knowledge, and
indulged that turn for ob&s;ervation, for which he
had been remarkable from his mo&s;t tender years:
neither did he believe a &s;hort ab&s;ence would tend
to the prejudice of his love, but, on the contrary,
inhance the value of his heart, becau&s;e he &s;hould
return better accompli&s;hed, and con&s;equently a
more welcome offering to his mi&s;tre&s;s. Elevated
with the&s;e &s;entiments, his heart dilated with joy,
and the &s;luices of his natural benevolence being
opened by this happy turn of his affairs, he &s;ent
his compliments to Mr. Jolter, to whom he had
not &s;poken during a whole week, and de&s;ired
he would favour Mr. Hatchway and him with his
company at &s;upper.</P>
<P>The governor was not weak enough to decline
this invitation, in con&s;equence of which he forth|with
appeared, and was cordially welcomed by
the relenting pupil, who expre&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow for
the mi&s;under&s;tanding which had prevailed be|tween
them, and a&s;&s;ured him, that for the future
he would avoid giving him any ju&s;t cau&s;e of
complaint. Jolter, who did not want affections,
was melted by this acknowledgment, which he
could not have expected, and earne&s;tly prote&s;ted,
that his chief &s;tudy had always been, and ever
<PB N="223" REF="231">
&s;hould be, to promote Mr. Pickle's intere&s;t and
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The be&s;t part of the night being &s;pent in the
circulation of a chearful gla&s;s, the company broke
up; and next morning Peregrine went out, with
a view of making his mi&s;tre&s;s acquainted with
his uncle's intention of &s;ending him out of the
kingdom for his improvement, and of &s;aying every
thing which he thought nece&s;&s;ary for the intere&s;t
of his love. He found her at breakfa&s;t with
her cou&s;in; and as he was very full of the &s;ubject
of his vi&s;it, had &s;carce fixed him&s;elf in his &s;eat,
when he brought it upon the carpet, by a&s;king
with a &s;mile, if the ladies had any commands for
Paris? Emilia at this que&s;tion began to &s;tare,
and her confidante de&s;ired to know who was
going thither? He no &s;ooner gave them to un|der&s;tand,
that he him&s;elf intended in a &s;hort
time to vi&s;it that capital, than his mi&s;tre&s;s, with
great precipitation, wi&s;hed him a good journey,
and affected to talk with indifference about the
plea&s;ures he would enjoy in France: but when
he &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured Sophy, who a&s;ked if he was
in earne&s;t, that his uncle actually in&s;i&s;ted upon
his making a &s;hort tour, than the tears gu&s;hed in
poor Emilia's eyes, and &s;he was at great pains to
conceal her concern, by ob&s;erving that the tea
was &s;o &s;calding hot, as to make her eyes water.
This pretext was too thin to impo&s;e upon her
lover, or even deceive the ob&s;ervation of her
friend Sophy, who after breakfa&s;t took an oppor|tunity
of quitting the room.</P>
<P>Thus left by them&s;elves, Peregrine imparted
to her what he had learnt of the commodore's
intention, without, however, mentioning a &s;yl|lable
of his being offended at their corre&s;pon|dence;
<PB N="224" REF="232">
and accompanied his information with
&s;uch &s;ervent vows of eternal con&s;tancy, and &s;o|lemn
promi&s;es of a &s;peedy return, that Emily's
heart, which had been invaded by a &s;u&s;picion,
that this &s;cheme of travelling was the effect of
her lover's incon&s;tancy, began to be more at
$a&s;e; and &s;he could not help &s;ignifying her ap|probation
of his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>This affair being amicably compromi&s;ed, he
a&s;ked how &s;oon &s;he propo&s;ed to &s;et out for her
mother's hou&s;e; and under&s;tanding that her de|parture
was fixed for next day but one, and
that her cou&s;in Sophy intended to accompany
her in her father's chariot, he repeated his in|tention
of attending her, and in the mean time
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his governor and the lieutenant to the
gari&s;on, with his compliments to his aunt and
the commodore, and a faithful promi&s;e of his
being with them in &s;ix days at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e previous mea&s;ures being taken, he, at|tended
by Pipes, &s;et out with the ladies; and
they had al&s;o a convoy for twelve miles from
Sophy's father, who, at parting, recommended
them piou&s;ly to the care of Peregrine, with
whom, by this time, he was perfectly well ac|quainted.</P>

<P>AS they travelled at an ea&s;y rate, they had
performed &s;omething more than one half
of their journey, when they were benighted near
an inn, at which they re&s;olved to lodge; the ac|commodation
was very good, they &s;$pped toge|ther
with great mirth and enjoyment, and it was
not till after he had been warned by the yawns of
the ladies, that he conducted them to their apart|ment;
and wi&s;hing them good night, retired to
his own, and went to re&s;t.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was crowded with country poeple
who had been at a neighbouring fair, and now
regaled them&s;elves with ale and tobacco in the
yard; &s;o that their con&s;ideration, which at any
time was but &s;lender, being now overwhelmed by
this debauch, they &s;taggered in to their re&s;pec|tive
kennels, and left a lighted candle flicking to
one of the wooden pillars that &s;upported the
gallery. The flame in a little time laid hold on
the wood, which was as d$y as tinder, and the
whole gallery was on fire, when Peregrine &s;ud|denly
waked, and found him&s;elf almo&s;t &s;uffo|cated.
He &s;prung up in an in&s;tant, &s;lipped on
his breeches, and throwing open the door of his
chamber, &s;aw the whole entry in a blaze.</P>
<P>Heavens! what were the emotions of his &s;oul,
when he beheld the volumes of flame and &s;moke
<PB N="226" REF="234">
rolling towards the room where his dear Emilia
lay! Regardle&s;s of his own danger, he darted
him&s;elf through the thicke&s;t of the gloom, when
knocking hard, and calling at the &s;ame time to
the ladies, with the mo&s;t anxious intreaty to be
admitted; the door was opened by Emilia in her
&s;hift, who a&s;ked with the utmo&s;t trepidation,
what was the matter? He made no reply, but
&s;natching her up in his arms, like another Aeneas,
bore her through the flames to a place of &s;afety;
where leaving her, before &s;he could recollect her|&s;elf,
or pronounce one word, but &startq;Alas! my
cou&s;in Sophy!&endq; he flew back to the re&s;cue of
that young lady, and found her already delivered
by Pipes, who having been alarmed by the &s;mell
of fire, had got up, ru&s;hed immediately to the
chamber where he knew the&s;e companions lodg|ed,
and (Emily being &s;aved by her lover) brought
off Mi&s;s Sophy, with the lo&s;s of his own &s;hock-head
of hair, which was &s;inged off in his re|treat.</P>
<P>By this time the whole inn was alarmed,
every lodger, as well as &s;ervant, exerted him|&s;elf,
in order to &s;top the progre&s;s of this cala|mity;
and there being a well repleni&s;hed hor&s;e-pond
in the yard, in le&s;s than an hour the fire
was totally extingui&s;hed, without having done
any other damage than that of con&s;uming about
two yards of the wooden gallery.</P>
<P>All this time our young gentleman clo&s;ely at|tended
his fair charge, each of whom had &s;woon|ed
with apprehen&s;ion; but as their con&s;titutions
were good, and their &s;pirits not ea&s;ily di&s;&s;ipated,
when upon reflection they found them&s;elves and
their company &s;afe, and that the flames were
happily quenched, the tumult of their fears &s;ub|&s;ided,
<PB N="227" REF="235">
they put on their cloaths, recovered their
good humour, and began to rally each other on
the trim in which they had been &s;ecured. Sophy
ob&s;erved, that now Mr. Pickle had an indi&s;putable
claim to her cou&s;in's affection; and therefore &s;he
ought to lay a&s;ide all affected re&s;erve for the fu|ture,
and frankly avow the &s;entiments of her
heart. Emily retorted the argument, putting
her in mind, that by the &s;ame claim Mr. Pipes
was intitled to the like return from her. Her
friend admitted the force of the conclu&s;ion, pro|vided
&s;he could not find means of &s;atisfying her
deliverer in another &s;hape; and turning to the
valet, who happened to be pre&s;ent, a&s;ked if his

did not conceive the meaning of the que&s;tion,
&s;tood $$lent according to cu&s;tom; and the inter|rogation
being repeated, an&s;wered with a grin,
&startq;Heart-whole as a bi&s;cuit, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, Mi|&s;tre&s;s.&endq;
&startq;What! (&s;aid Emilia) have you never
been in love, Thomas?&endq;. &startq;Yes, for&s;ooth, (re|plied
the valet, without he&s;itation) &s;ometimes of
a morning.&endq; Peregrine could not help laughing,
and his mi&s;tre&s;s looked a little di&s;concerted at
this blunt repartee; while Sophy, &s;lipping a pur&s;e
into his hand, told him there was &s;omething to
purcha&s;e a periwig. Tom having con&s;ulted his
ma&s;ter's eyes, refu&s;ed the pre&s;ent, &s;aying, &startq;No,
thank ye as much as if I did.&endq; And though &s;he
in&s;i&s;ted upon his putting it in his pocket, as a

be prevailed upon to avail him&s;elf of her gene|ro&s;ity;

the morals of his &s;ervant, who rough and un|cultivated
as he was, had &s;en&s;e enough to per|ceive
that he had no preten&s;ion to any &s;uch ac|knowledgment.
But &s;he argued with great ve|hemence,

ea&s;y in her own mind, until &s;he found
&s;ome opportunity of manife&s;ting the &s;en&s;e &s;he had
of the obligation: &startq;I do not pretend (&s;aid &s;he)
to reward Mr. Pipes; but I &s;hall be ab&s;olutely
unhappy, unle&s;s I am allowed to give him &s;ome
token of my regard.&endq;</P>
<P>Peregrine thus earne&s;tly &s;ollicited, de&s;ired that
&s;ince &s;he was bent upon di&s;playing her genero&s;ity,
&s;he would not be&s;tow upon him any pecuniary
gratification, but honour him with &s;ome trinket,
as a mark of con&s;ideration; becau&s;e he him&s;elf
had &s;uch a particular value for the fellow, on ac|count
of his attachment and fidelity, that he
&s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee him treated on the footing
of a common mercenary dome&s;tick.</P>
<P>There was not one jewel in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
this grateful young lady, that &s;he would not have
gladly given as a recompence, or badge of di|&s;tinction,
to her re&s;cuer: but his ma&s;ter pitched
upon a &s;eal ring of no great value that hung at
her watch; and Pipes being called in, had per|mi&s;&s;ion
to accept that te&s;timony of Mi&s;s Sophy's
favour. Tom received it accordingly with &s;un|dry
&s;crapes, and having ki&s;&s;ed it with great devo|tion,
put it on his little finger, and &s;trutted off,
extremely proud of his acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="237">
Emilia, with a mo&s;t enchanting &s;weetne&s;s of
a&s;pect, told her lover, that he had in&s;tructed her
how to behave towards him; and taking a dia|mond
ring from her finger, de&s;ired he would
wear it for her &s;ake. He received the pledge as
became him, and pre&s;ented another in exchange,
which &s;he at fir&s;t refu&s;ed, alledging that it would
de&s;troy the intent of her acknowledgment; but
Peregrine a&s;&s;ured her, he had accepted her jewel,
not as a proof of her gratitude, but as the mark
of her love; and that if &s;he refu&s;ed a mutual
token, he &s;hould look upon him&s;elf as the object
of her di&s;dain. Her eyes kindled, and her cheeks
glowed with re&s;entment at this impudent intima|tion,
which &s;he con&s;idered as an un&s;ea&s;onable in|&s;ult;
and the young gentleman perceiving her
emotion, &s;tood corrected for his temerity, and
a&s;ked pardon for the liberty of his remon&s;trance,
which he hoped &s;he would a&s;cribe to the preva|lence
of that principle alone, which he had al|ways
taken pride in avowing.</P>
<P>Sophy &s;eeing him di&s;concerted, interpo&s;ed in
his behalf, and chid her cou&s;in for having prac|ti&s;ed
&s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary affectation; upon which
Emilia, &s;oftened into compliance, held out her
finger as a &s;ignal of her conde&s;cen&s;ion. Pere|grine
put on the ring with great eagerne&s;s,
mumbled her &s;oft white hand in an exta&s;y, which
would not allow him to confine his embraces to
that limb, but urged him to &s;eize her by the
wai&s;t, and &s;natch a delicious ki&s;s from her love-pouting
lips; nor would he leave her a butt to
the ridicule of Sophy, on who&s;e mouth he in|&s;tantly
committed a rape of the &s;ame nature; &s;o
that the two friends, countenanced by each
other, reprehended him with &s;uch gentlene&s;s of
<PB N="230" REF="238">
rebuke, that he was almo&s;t tempted to repeat the
offence.</P>
<P>The morning being now lighted up, and the
&s;ervants of the inn on foot, he ordered &s;ome cho|colate
for breakfa&s;t, and at the de&s;ire of the la|dies
&s;ent Pipes to &s;ee the hor&s;es fed, and the cha|riot
prepared, while he went to the bar, and di&s;|charged
the bill.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures being taken, they &s;et out
about five o'clock, and having refre&s;hed them|&s;elves
and their cattle at another inn on the road,
during the heat of the day, they proceeded in
the afternoon; and, without meeting with any
other accident, &s;afely arrived at the place of
their de&s;tination, where Mrs. Gauntlet expre&s;&s;ed
her joy at &s;eeing her old friend Mr. Pickle, whom,
however, &s;he kindly reproached for the long di&s;|continuance
of his regard. Without explaining
the cau&s;e of that interruption, he prote&s;ted that
his love and e&s;teem had never been di&s;continued,
and that for the future he &s;hould omit no occa&s;ion
of te&s;tifying how much he had her friend&s;hip at
heart. She then made him acquainted with her
&s;on, who at that time was in the hou&s;e, being
excu&s;ed from his duty by furlow.</P>
<P>This young man, who&s;e name was godfrey,
was about the age of twenty, of a middling &s;ize,
vigorous make, remarkably well &s;haped, and the
&s;cars of the &s;mall pox, of which he bore a good
number, added a peculiar manline&s;s to the air of
his count nance. His capacity was good, and
his di&s;po&s;ition naturally frank and ea&s;y; but he
had been a &s;oldier from his infancy, and his edu|cation
was altogether in the military &s;tile. He
looked upon ta&s;te and letters as meer pedantry,
beneath the con&s;ideration of a gentleman, and
<PB N="231" REF="239">
every civil &s;tation of life as mean, when com|pared
with the profe&s;&s;ion of arms. He had made
great progre&s;s in the gymna&s;tic &s;ciences of dan|cing,
fencing and riding, played perfectly well
on the German flute, and above all things va|lued
him&s;elf upon a &s;crupulous ob&s;ervance of all
the points of honour.</P>
<P>Had Peregrine and he con&s;idered them&s;elves
upon equal footing, in all probability they would
have immediately entered into a league of inti|macy
and friend&s;hip; but this &s;ufficient &s;oldier
looked upon his &s;i&s;ter's admirer as a young &s;tu|dent
raw from the univer&s;ity, and utterly igno|rant
of mankind, while &s;quire Pickle beheld
Godfrey in the light of a needy volunteer,
greatly inferior to him&s;elf in fortune, as well as
every other accompli&s;hment. This mutual mi&s;|under&s;tanding
could not fail of producing ani|mo&s;ities.
The very next day after Peregrine's ar|rival,
&s;ome &s;harp repartees pa&s;&s;ed between them
in pre&s;ence of the ladies, before whom each en|deavoured
to a&s;&s;ert his own &s;uperiority. In the&s;e
conte&s;ts our hero never failed of obtaining the
victory, becau&s;e his genius was more acute, and
his talents better cultivated than tho&s;e of his an|tagoni&s;t,
who therefore took umbrage at his &s;uc|ce&s;s,
became jealous of his reputation, and be|gan
to treat him with marks of &s;corn and di&s;|re&s;pect.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter &s;aw, and dreading the con&s;equence
of his ferocity, not only took him to ta&s;k in
private for his impolite behaviour, but al&s;o in|treated
her lover to make allowances for the
roughne&s;s of her brother's education. He kindly
a&s;&s;ured her, that whatever pains it might co&s;t him
to vanqui&s;h his own impetuous temper, he would
<PB N="232" REF="240">
for her &s;ake endure all the mortifications to
which her brother's arrogance might expo&s;e him;
and after having &s;tayed with her two days, and
enjoyed &s;everal private interviews, during which
he acted the part of a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate lover, he
took his leave of Mrs. Gauntlet over-night, and
told the young ladies he would call early next
morning, to bid them farewel. He did not neg|lect
this piece of duty, and found the two friends
and breakfa&s;t already prepared in the parlour.
All three being extremely affected with the
thoughts of parting, a mo&s;t pathetic &s;ilence for
&s;ome time prevailed, till Peregrine put an end to
it, by lamenting his fate, in being obliged to exile
him&s;elf &s;o long from the dear object of his mo&s;t
intere&s;ting wi&s;h; and begged with the mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t
&s;upplications, that &s;he would now, in con|&s;ideration
of the cruel ab&s;ence he mu&s;t &s;uffer,
give him the con&s;olation which &s;he had hitherto
refu&s;ed, namely, that of knowing he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
a place within her heart. The confidante &s;e|conded
his reque&s;t, repre&s;enting that it was now
no time to di&s;gui&s;e her &s;entiments, when her
lover was about to leave the kingdom, and might
be in danger of contracting other connexions,
unle&s;s he was confirmed in his con&s;tancy, by
knowing how far he could depend upon her love;
and in &s;hort, &s;he was plied with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible
importuniti$s, that &s;he an&s;wered in the utmo&s;t
confu&s;ion, &startq;Tho' I have avoided literal ac|knowledgments,
methinks the circum&s;tances of
my behaviour might have convinced Mr. Pickle,
that I do not regard him as a common acquain|tance.&endq;
&startq;My charming Emily! (cried the im|patient
lover, throwing him&s;elf at her feet) why
will you deal out my happine&s;s in &s;uch &s;canty
<PB N="233" REF="241">
portions? Why will you thus mince the decla|ration
which would overwhelm me with plea&s;ure,
and chear my lonely reflection, while I &s;igh
amid the &s;olitude of &s;eparation?&endq; His fair mi|&s;t$e&s;s,
melted by this image, replied, with the
tears gu&s;hing from her eyes, &startq;I'm afraid I &s;hall
feel that &s;ep$ration more &s;everely than you ima|gine&endq;
Tran&s;ported at this flattering confe&s;&s;ion,
he pre&s;&s;ed her to his brea&s;t, and wh$le her head
re$lined upon his neck, mingled his tears with
hers in great abundance, and breathed the mo&s;t
tender vows of eternal fidelity. The gentle heart
of Sophy could not bear this &s;cene unmoved,
&s;he wept with &s;ympathy, and encouraged the lo|vers
to re&s;ign them&s;elves to the will of fate, and
&s;upport their &s;pirits with the hope of meeting
again on happier terms. Finally, after mutual
promi&s;es, exhortations and endearments, Pere|grine
took his leave, his heart being &s;o full, that
he could &s;carce pronounce the word &startq;<HI>Adieu!</HI>&endq;
and mounting his hor&s;e at the door, &s;et out with
Pipes for the gari&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine is overtaken by Mr. Gauntlet, with
whom he fights a duel, and contracts an intimate
friend&s;hip. He arrives at the gari&s;on, and
finds his mother as implacable as ever. He is
in&s;ulted by his brother Gam, who&s;e preceptor he
di&s;ciplines with a hor&s;e-whip.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to expel the melancholy images that
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his fancy, at parting from
his mi&s;tre&s;s, he called in the flattering ideas of
tho&s;e plea&s;ures he expected to enjoy in France;
<PB N="234" REF="242">
and before he had rode ten miles, his imagination
was effectually amu&s;ed.</P>
<P>While he thus pro&s;ecuted his travels by antici|pation,
and indulged him&s;elf in all the in&s;olence
of hope, at the truning of a lane he was all of
a &s;udden overtaken by Emilia's brother on hor&s;e|back,
who told him he was riding the &s;ame way,
and &s;hould be glad of his company.</P>
<P>This young gentleman, whether prompted by
per&s;onal pique, or actuated with zeal for the
honour of his family, had followed our hero,
with a view of obliging him to explain the na|ture
of his attachment to his &s;i&s;ter. Peregrine
returned his compliment with &s;uch di&s;dainful ci|vility,
as gave him room to believe that he &s;u&s;|&s;pected
his errand; and therefore, without fur|ther
preamble, he declared his bu&s;ine&s;s in the&s;e
words: &startq;Mr. Pickle, you have carried on a
corre&s;pondence with my &s;i&s;ter for &s;ome time,
and I &s;hould be glad to know the nature of it?&endq;
To this que&s;tion our lover replied, &startq;Sir, I
&s;hould be glad to know what title you have to
demand that &s;atisfaction?&endq; &startq;Sir, (an&s;wered
the other) I demand it in the capacity of a bro|ther,
jealous of his own honour, as well as of
his &s;i&s;ter's reputation; and if your intentions are
honourable, you will not refu&s;e it.&endq; &startq;Sir, (&s;aid
Peregrine) I am not at pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ed to appeal
to your opinion for the rectitude of my inten|tions;
and I think you a&s;&s;ume a little too much
improtance, in pretending to judge my conduct.&endq;
&startq;Sir, (replied the &s;oldier) I pretend to judge
the conduct of every man who interferes with
my concerns, and even to cha&s;ti&s;e him, if I
think he acts ami&s;s.&endq; &startq;Cha&s;ti&s;e! (cried the
youth, with indignation in his looks) &s;ure you
<PB N="235" REF="243">
dare not apply that term to me?&endq; &startq;You are
mi&s;taken (&s;aid Godfrey) I dare do any thing that
becomes the character of a gentleman.&endq; &startq;Gen|tleman,
God wot! (replied the other, looking
contemptuou&s;ly at his ewquipage, which was none
of the mo&s;t &s;uperb) a very pretty gentleman,
truly!&endq; The &s;oldier's wrath was inflamed by
this ironical repetition, the contempt of which
his con&s;cious poverty made him feel; and he
called his antagoni&s;t pre&s;umptuous boy, in&s;olent
up&s;tart, with other epithets, which Perry re|torted
with great bitterne&s;s: and a formal chal|lenge
having pa&s;&s;ed between them, they alighted
at the fir&s;t inn, and walked into the next field,
in order to decide their quarrel by the &s;word.
Having pitched upon the &s;pot, helped to pull off
each other's boots, and laid a&s;ide their coats and
wai&s;tcoats, Mr. Gauntlet told his opponent, that
he him&s;elf was looked upon in the army as an
expert &s;word&s;man, and that if Mr. Pickle had
not made that &s;cience his particular &s;tudy, they
&s;hould be upon a more equal footing in u&s;ing pi|&s;tols.
Peregrine was too much incen&s;ed to thank
him for his plain dealing, and too confident of
his own &s;kill to reli&s;h the other's propo&s;al, which
he accordingly rejected; and drawing his &s;word,
ob&s;erved, that were he to treat Mr. Gauntlet ac|cording
to his de&s;erts, he would order his man to
puni&s;h his audacity with an hor&s;e-whip. Exa&s;|perated
at this expre&s;&s;ion, which he con&s;idered
as an indelible affront, he made no reply, but
attacked his adver&s;ary with equal ferocity and ad|dre&s;s.
The youth parried his fir&s;t and &s;econd
thru&s;t, but received the third in the out&s;ide of
his &s;word arm. Though the wound was &s;uper|ficial,
he was tran&s;ported with rage at &s;ight of
<PB N="236" REF="244">
his own blood, and returned the a&s;&s;ault with
&s;uch fury and precipitation, that Gauntlet, loath
to take advantage of his unguarded heat, &s;tood
upon the defen&s;ive; and in the &s;econd longe,
Peregrine's weapon entering a kind of net-work
in the &s;hell of Godfrey's &s;word, the blade
&s;napped in two, and left him at the mercy of the
&s;oldier, who, far from making an in&s;olent u&s;e
of the victory he had gained, put up his Toledo
with great deliberation, like a man who had
been u&s;ed to that kind of rencounters, ob&s;erved
that &s;uch a blade as Peregrine's was not to be
tru&s;ted with a man's life, and advi&s;ing the owner
to treat a gentleman in di&s;tre&s;s with more re&s;pect
for the future, &s;lipped on his boots, and wi$h
&s;ullen dignity of demeanour &s;talked back to the
inn.</P>
<P>Though Pickle was extremely mortified at his
mi&s;carriage in this adventure, he was al&s;o &s;truck
with the behaviour of his antagoni&s;t, which a&s;|&s;ected
him the more, as he under&s;tood that God|frey's
<HI>fiert&egrave;</HI> had proceeded from the jealous &s;en|&s;ibility
of a gentleman declined into the vale of
misfortune. Gauntlet's valour and moderation
induced him to put a favourable con&s;truction on
all tho&s;e circum&s;tances of that young &s;oldier's
conduct, which before had given him di&s;gu&s;t;
and though in any other ca&s;e he would have in|du&s;triou&s;ly
avoided the lea&s;t appearance of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
he followed his conqueror to the inn,
with a view of thanking him for his generous for|bearance,
and of &s;olliciting his friend&s;hip and
corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Godfrey had his foot in the &s;tirrup to mount,
when Peregrine coming up to him, de&s;ired he
would defer his departure for a quarter of an
<PB N="237" REF="245">
hour, and favour him with a little private con|ver&s;ation.
The &s;oldier, who mi&s;took the mean|ing
of the reque&s;t, immediately quitted his hor&s;e,
and followed Pickle into a chamber, where he
expected to find a brace of pi&s;tols loaded on the
table; but he was very agreeably deceived, when
our hero, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms, acknow|ledged
his noble department in the field, owned
that till then he had mi&s;under&s;tood his character,
and begged that he would honour him with his
intimacy and corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Gauntlet, who had &s;een undoubted proofs of
Peregrine's courage, which $ad con&s;iderably rai&s;ed
him in his e&s;teem, and had &s;en&s;e enough to per|ceive
that this conce&s;&s;ion was not owing to any
&s;ordid or &s;ini&s;ter motive, embraced his offer with
demon&s;trations of infinite &s;atisfaction; and when
he under&s;tood the terms on which Mr. Pickle
was with his &s;i&s;ter, proffered his &s;ervice in his
turn, either as agent, mediator, or confidant:
nay, to give this new friend a convincing proof
of his &s;incerity, he di&s;clo&s;ed to him a pa&s;&s;ion
which he had for &s;ome time entertained for his
cou&s;in Mi&s;s Sophy, though he dur&s;t not reveal
his &s;entiments to her father, le&s;t he &s;hould be of|fended
at his pre&s;umption, and withdraw his pro|tection
from the family.</P>
<P>Peregrine's generous heart was wrung with
angui&s;h, when he under&s;tood that this young
gentleman, who was the only &s;on of a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
officer, had carried arms for the &s;pace
of five years, without being able to obtain a &s;ub|altern's
commi&s;&s;ion, though he had always be|haved
with remarkable regularity and &s;pirit, and
acquired the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem of all the of|ficers
under whom he had &s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="246">
He would, at that time, with the utmo&s;t plea|&s;ure,
have &s;hared his finances with him; but as
he would not run the ri&s;k of offending the young
&s;oldier's delicacy of honour, by a premature ex|ertion
of his liberality, he re&s;olved to in&s;inuate
him&s;elf into an intimacy with him, before he
would venture to take &s;uch freedoms; and with
that view pre&s;&s;ed Mr. Gauntlet to accompany him
to the gari&s;on, where he did not doubt of hav|ing
influence enough to make him a welcome
gue&s;t. Godfrey thanked him very courteou&s;ly for
his invitation, which he &s;aid he could not imme|diately
accept, but promi&s;ed if he would favour
him with a letter, and fix the time at which he
propo&s;ed to &s;et out for France, he would endea|vour
to vi&s;it him at the commodore's habitation,
and from thence give him a convoy to Dover.
This new treaty being &s;ettled, and a do&s;&s;il of lint
with a &s;nip of plai&s;ter applied to our adventurer's
wound, he parted from the brother of his dear
Emilia, to whom and his friend Sophy he &s;ent
his kinde&s;t wi&s;hes; and having lodged one night
upon the road, arrived next day in the afternoon
at the gari&s;on, where he found all his friends in
good health, and overjoyed at his return.</P>
<P>The commodore, who was by this time turned
of &s;eventy, and altogether crippled by the gout,
&s;eldom went abroad; and as his conver&s;ation was
not very entertaining, had but little company
within doors; &s;o that his &s;pirits mu&s;t have quite
&s;tagnated, had not they been kept in motion by
the conver&s;ation of Hatchway, and received at
different times an whole&s;ome fillip from the di&s;|cipline
of his &s;pou&s;e, who, by the force of pride,
religion and Coniac, had erected a mo&s;t terrible
tyranny in the hou&s;e. There was &s;uch a quick
<PB N="239" REF="247">
circulation of dome&s;ticks in the family, that every
&s;uit of livery had been worn by figures of all di|men&s;ions:
Trunnion him&s;elf had long before
this time yielded to the torrent of her arbitrary
&s;way; though not without divers ob&s;tinate ef|forts
to maintain his liberty; and now, that he
was di&s;abled by his iufirmities, when he u&s;ed to
hear his empre&s;s &s;inging the loud Orthyan &s;ong
among the &s;ervants below, he would often in
whi&s;pers communicate to the lieutenant, hints of
what he would do if &s;o be he was not deprived of
the u&s;e of his precious limbs. Hatchway was the
only per&s;on whom the temper of Mrs. Trunnion
re&s;pected, either becau&s;e &s;he dreaded his ridicule,
or looked upon his per&s;on with the eyes of affec|tion.
This being the &s;ituation of things in the
gari&s;on, it is not to be doubted that the old gen|tleman
highly enjoyed the pre&s;ence of Peregrine,
who found means to ingratiate him&s;elf &s;o effec|tually
with his aunt, that while he remained at
home, &s;he &s;eemed to have exchanged the di&s;po&s;i|tion
of a tygre&s;s, for that of a gentle kid; but he
found his own mother as implacable, and his fa|ther
as much hen-pecked as ever.</P>
<P>Gamaliel, who now very &s;eldom enjoyed the
conver&s;ation of his old friend the commodore,
had &s;ome time ago entered into an amicable &s;o|ciety,
con&s;i&s;ting of the barber, apothecary, at|torney
and exci&s;eman of the pari&s;h, among whom
he u&s;ed to &s;pend the evening at Tunley's, and
li&s;ten to their di&s;putes upon philo&s;ophy and poli|ticks,
with great comfort and edification, while
his &s;overeign lady domineered at home as u&s;ual,
vi&s;ited with great pomp in the neighbourhood,
and employed her chief care in the education of
her darling &s;on Gam, who was now in the fif|teenth
<PB N="240" REF="248">
year of his age, and &s;o remarkable for his
perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, that in &s;pite of his mother's
influence and authority, he was not only hated,
but al&s;o de&s;pi&s;ed both at home and abroad. She
had put him under the tuition of the curate who
lived in the family, and was obliged to attend him
in all his exerci&s;es and excur&s;ions. This governor
was a low bred fellow, who had neither experi|ence
nor ingenuity, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large fund of
adulation and &s;ervile complai&s;ance, by which he
had gained the good graces of Mrs. Pickle, and
pre&s;ided over all her deliberations in the &s;ame
manner as his &s;uperior managed tho&s;e of Mrs.
Trunnion.</P>
<P>He had one day rode out to take the air with
his pupil, who, as I have already ob&s;erved, was
odious to the poor people, for having killed their
dogs and broken their inclo&s;ures, and on account
of his hump, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of my
lord; when in a narrow lane they chanced to
meet Peregrine on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The young &s;quire no &s;ooner perceived his elder
brother, for whom he had been in&s;tructed to en|tertain
the mo&s;t inveterate grudge, than he re|&s;olved
to in&s;ult him <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> and actually rode
again&s;t him full gallop. Our hero gue&s;&s;ing his aim,
fixed him&s;elf in his &s;tirrups, and by a dexterous
management of the reins, avoided the &s;hock in
&s;uch a manner, as that their legs only &s;hould en|counter,
by which means my lord was tilted out
of his &s;addle, and in a twinkling laid &s;prawling in
the dirt. The governor enraged at the di&s;grace
of his charge, advanced with great in&s;olence and
fury, and &s;truck at Peregrine with his whip. No|thing
could be more agreeable to our young gen|tleman
than this a&s;&s;ault, which furni&s;hed him
<PB N="241" REF="249">
with an opportunity of cha&s;ti&s;ing an officious
wretch, who&s;e petulance and malice he had longed
to puni&s;h. He therefore, &s;purring up his hor&s;e
towards his antagoni&s;t, overthrew him in the
middle of a hedge; and before he had time to
recollect him&s;elf from the confu&s;ion of the fall,
alighted in a trice, and exerci&s;ed his hor&s;e-whip
with &s;uch agility about the curate's face and ears,
that he was fain to pro&s;trate him&s;elf before his
enraged conqueror, and implore his forbearance
in the mo&s;t abject terms. While Peregrine was
thus employed, his brother Gam had made &s;hift
to ri&s;e, and attack him in the rear; for which
rea&s;on, when the tutor was quelled, the victor
faced about, &s;natched the weapon out of his
hand, and having broken it to pieces, remounted
his hor&s;e, and rode off, without deigning to ho|nour
him with any other notice.</P>
<P>The condition in which they returned pro|duced
infinite clamour again&s;t the conqueror, who
was repre&s;ented as a ruffian who had lain in am|bu&s;h
to make away with his brother, in who&s;e
defence the curate was &s;aid to have received tho&s;e
cruel &s;tripes, that hindered him from appearing
for three whole weeks in the performance of his
duty at church.</P>
<P>Complaints were made to the commodore, who
having inquired into the circum&s;tances of the af|fair,
approved of what his nephew had done;
adding, with many oaths, that, provided Pere|grine
had been out of the &s;crape, he wi&s;hed Crook|back
had broke his neck in the fall.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He projects a plan of revenge, which is executed
again&s;t the curate.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero, exa&s;perated at the villainy of the
curate, in the treacherous mi&s;repre&s;entation
he had made of this rencounter, determined to
practi&s;e upon him a method of revenge, which
&s;hould be not only effectual, but al&s;o unattended
with any bad con&s;equence to him&s;elf. For this
purpo&s;e he and Hatchway, to whom he imparted
his plan, went to the alehou&s;e one evening, and
called for an empty room, knowing there was
no other but that which they had cho&s;en for the
&s;cene of action. This apartment was a &s;ort of a
parlour that fronted the kitchen, with a window
towards the yard; where, after they had &s;at
&s;ome time, the lieutenant found means to amu&s;e
the landlord in di&s;cour&s;e, while Peregrine &s;tep|ping
out into the yard, by the talent of mimickry,
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a &s;urpri&s;ing degree, coun|terfeited
a dialogue between the curate and Tun|ley's
wife; which reaching the ears of the pub|lican,
for who&s;e hearing it was calculated, in|flamed
his naturally jealous di&s;po&s;ition to &s;uch a
degree, that he could not conceal his emotion,
but made an hundred efforts to quit the room;
while the lieutenant, &s;moaking his pipe with great
gravity, as if he neither heard what pa&s;&s;ed, nor
took notice of the landlord's di&s;order, detained
him on the &s;pot by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of que&s;tions
which he could not refu&s;e to an&s;wer; though he
&s;tood &s;weating with agony all the time, &s;tretching
his neck every in&s;tant towards the window thro'
<PB N="243" REF="251">
which the voices were conveyed, &s;cratching his
head, and exhibiting &s;undry other &s;ymptoms of
impatience and agitation. At length, the &s;up|po&s;ed
conver&s;ation came to &s;uch a pitch of amo|rous
complai&s;ance, that the hu&s;band, quite frantic
with his imaginary di&s;grace, ru&s;hed out at the
door, crying, &startq;Coming, Sir.&endq; But, as he was
obliged to make a circuit round one half of the
hou&s;e, Peregrine had got in by the window, be|fore
Tunley arrived in the yard.</P>
<P>According to the feigned intelligence he had
received, he ran directly to the b$rn, in expecta|tion
of making &s;ome very extraordinary di&s;co|very;
and having employed &s;ome minutes in
rummaging the &s;traw to no purpo&s;e, returned in
a &s;tate of di&s;traction to the kitchen,ju&s;t as his
wife chanced to enter at the other door. The
circum&s;tance of her appearance confirmed him
in the opinion, that the deed was done; but as
the di&s;ea&s;e of being hen-peck'd was epidemic in
the pari&s;h, he dur&s;t not expre&s;s the lea&s;t hint of
his unea&s;ine&s;s to her, but re&s;olved to take ven|geance
on the libidinous prie&s;t, who, he ima|gined,
had corrupted the cha&s;tity of his &s;pou&s;e.</P>
<P>The two confederates, in order to be certi|fied
that their &s;cheme had taken effect, as well
as to blow up the flame which they had kindled,
called for Tunley, in who&s;e countenance they
could ea&s;ily di&s;cern his confu&s;ion; and Peregrine
de&s;iring him to &s;it down and drink a gla&s;s with
them, began to interrogate him about his family,
and among other things, a&s;ked him how long he
had been married to that hand&s;ome wife? This
que&s;tion, which was put with an arch &s;ignificance
of look, alarmed the publican, who begin to
fear that Pickle had overheard his di&s;honour; and
<PB N="244" REF="252">
this &s;u&s;picion was not at all removed, when the
lieutenant, with a &s;ly regard, pronounced, &startq;Tun|ley,
wan't you noo&s;ed by the curate?&endq; &startq;Yes, I
was,&endq; (replied the landlord, with an eagerne&s;s
and perplexity of tone, as if he thought the lieu|tenant
knew, that <HI>thereby hangs a tale;</HI>) and
Hatchway &s;upported this &s;u&s;picion, by an&s;wering,
&startq;Nay, as for that matter, the curate may be a
very &s;ufficient man in his way.&endq; This tran&s;ition
from his wife to the curate, convinced him that
his &s;hame was known to his gue&s;ts; and in the
tran&s;port of his indignation, he pronounced with
great empha&s;is, &startq;A &s;ufficient man! Odds heart!
I believe they are all wolves in &s;heeps cloathing.
I wi&s;h to God I could &s;ee the day, ma&s;ter, when
there &s;hall not be a prie&s;t, an exci&s;eman, or a
cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer in this kingdom. As for
that fellow of a curate, if I do catch him&mdash;It
don't &s;ignify talking&mdash;But, by the Lord!&mdash;
Gentlemen, my &s;ervice to you.&endq;</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ociates being &s;atisfied by the&s;e abrupt
in&s;inuations, that they had &s;o far &s;ucceeded in
their aim, waited with impatience two or three
days, in expectation of hearing that Tunley had
fallen upon &s;ome method of being revenged for
this imaginary wrong: but finding that either his
invention was too &s;hallow, or his inclination too
languid to gratify their de&s;ire of his own accord,
they determined to bring the affair to &s;uch a cri|&s;is,
that he &s;hould not be able to with&s;tand the
opportunity of executing his vengeance. With
this view, they one evening hired a boy to run
to Mr. Pickle's hou&s;e, and tell the curate, that
Mrs. Tunley being taken &s;uddenly ill, her hu&s;|band
de&s;ired he would come immediately, and
pray with her. Mean while, they had taken
<PB N="245" REF="253">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a room in the hou&s;e; and Hatch|way
engaging the landlord in conver&s;ation, Pe|regrine
in his return from the yard ob&s;erved, as
if by accident, that the par&s;on was gone into the
kitchen, in order, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, to cat$chi&s;e
Tunley's wife.</P>
<P>The publican &s;tarted at this intelligence, and
under pretence of &s;erving another company in
the next room, went out to the barn, and arm|ing
him&s;elf with a flail, repaired to a lane thro'
which the curate was under a nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing
in his way home. There he lay in ambu&s;h, with
fell intent; and when the &s;uppo&s;ed author of his
&s;hame arrived, greeted him in the dark with &s;uch
a &s;alutation, as forced him to &s;tagger backward
three paces at lea&s;t. If the &s;econd application had
taken effect, in all probability that &s;pot would have
been the boundary of the pa$&s;on's mortal peregri|nation;
but, luckily for him, his antagoni&s;t was
not expert in the management of his weapon,
which, by a twi&s;t of the thong that connected
the legs, in&s;tead of pitching upon the head of the
a&s;toni&s;hed curate, de&s;cended in an oblique di|rection
on his own pate, with &s;uch a &s;wing, that
the &s;kull actually rung like an apothecary's mor|tar,
and ten thou&s;and lights &s;eemed to dance be|fore
his eyes. The curate recollecting him&s;elf
during the re&s;pite he obtained from this accident,
and believing his aggre&s;&s;or to be &s;ome thief who
lurked in that place for prey, re&s;olved to make a
running fight, until he &s;hould arrive within cry
of his habitation. With this de&s;ign he rai&s;ed up
his cudgel for the defence of his head, and be|taking
him&s;elf to his heels, began to roar for help
with the lungs of a Stentor. Tunley throwing
away the flail, which he dur&s;t no longer tru&s;t
<PB N="246" REF="254">
with the execution of his revenge, pur&s;ued the
fugitive with all the &s;peed he could exert; and
the other, either unnerv'd by fear, or &s;tum|bling
over a &s;tone, was overtaken before he had
run an hundred paces. He no &s;ooner felt the
wind of the publican's fi&s;t that whi&s;tled round
his ears, than he fell flat upon the earth at full
length, and the cudgel flew from his uncla&s;ping
hand; when Tunley &s;pringing like a tyger upon
his back, rained &s;uch a &s;hower of blows upon his
carca&s;e, that he imagined him&s;elf under the di&s;ci|pline
of ten pair of fi&s;ts at lea&s;t: yet the imagi|nary
cuckold, not &s;atisfied with annoying the
prie&s;t in this manner, laid hold on one of his ea$s
with his teeth, and bit &s;o unmercifully, that the
curate was found almo&s;t intranced with pain by
two labourers, at who&s;e approach the a&s;&s;ailant re|treated
unperceived.</P>
<P>The lieutenant had po&s;ted him&s;elf at the win|dow,
in order to &s;ee the landlord at his fir&s;t re|turn;
and no &s;ooner perceived him enter the
yard, than he called him into the apartment,
impatient to learn the effects of their &s;tratagem.
Tunley obeyed the &s;ummons, and appeared be|fore
his gue&s;ts in all the violence of rage, di&s;or|der
and fatigue; his no&s;trils were dilated more
than one half beyond their natural capacity, his
eyes rolled, his teeth chattered, he &s;nored in
breathing as if he had been oppre&s;&s;ed by the night|mare,
and &s;treams of &s;weat flowed down each
&s;ide of his forehead.</P>
<P>Peregrine affecting to &s;tart at the approach of
&s;uch an uncouth figure, a&s;ked if he had been
wre&s;tling with a &s;pirit; upon which he an&s;wered
with great vehemence, &startq;Spirit! No, no, ma|&s;ter,
I have had a roll and tumble with the fle&s;h.
<PB N="247" REF="255">
A dog! I'll teach him to come a caterwauling
about my doors.&endq; Gue&s;&s;ing from this reply, that
his aim was accompli&s;hed, and curious to know
the particulars of the rencounter, &startq;Well then,
(&s;aid the youth) I hope you have prevailed again&s;t
the fle&s;h, Tunley.&endq; &startq;Yes, yes, (an&s;wered the
publican) I have cooled his capi&s;&s;ens, as the &s;ay|ing
is; I have played &s;uch a tune about his ears,
that I'll be bound he &s;han't long for mu&s;ick this
month. A goati&s;h ram-fac'd ra&s;cal! Why,
he's a perfect pari&s;h bull, as I hope to live.&endq;</P>
<P>Hatchway ob&s;erving that he &s;eemed to have
made a &s;tout battle, de&s;ired he would &s;it down
and recover wind; and after he had &s;wallowed a
brace of bumpers, his vanity prompted him to ex|patiate
upon his own exploit in &s;uch a manner,
that the confederates, without &s;eeming to know
the curate was his antagoni&s;t, became acquainted
with every circum&s;tance of the ambu&s;cade.</P>
<P>Tunley had &s;carce got the better of his agita|tion,
when his wife entering the room, told
them by way of news, that &s;ome waggi&s;h body
had &s;ent Mr. Sackbut the curate to pray with her.
This name inflamed the hu&s;band's choler anew,
and forgetting all his complai&s;ance for his &s;pou&s;e,
he replied with a rancorous grin, &startq;Add rabbit
him! I doubt not but you found his admonitions
deadly comfortable!&endq; The landlady, looking
at her va&s;&s;al with a &s;overeign a&s;pect, &startq;What
crotchets (&s;aid &s;he) have you got in your fool's
head, I trow? I know no bu&s;ine&s;s you have to
&s;it here like a gentleman with you arms akimbo,
when there's another company in the hou&s;e to be
&s;erved.&endq; The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive hu&s;band took the hint,
and without further expo&s;tulation, &s;neaked out
of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="256">
Next day it was reported, that Mr. Sackbut

offering a reward to any per&s;$n that &s;hould

for attacking our hero in the dark, that, had it
been executed according to their intention, the
young gentleman's &s;cheme of travelling would
have been effectually marred. But their machi|nations
were overheard by Mi&s;s Pickle, who was
now in the &s;eventeenth year of her age, and, in
&s;pite of the prejudice of education, entertained
in &s;ecret a mo&s;t &s;i&s;terly affection for her brother
Perry, though &s;he had never &s;poke to him, and
was deterred by the precepts, vigilance and me|naces
of her mother, from attempting any means
of meeting him in private. She was not&punc; how|ever,
in&s;en&s;ible to his prai&s;e, which was loudly
&s;ounded forth in the neighbourhood, and never
failed of going to church, and every other place,
where &s;he thought &s;he might have an opportunity
of &s;eeing this amiable brother. With the&s;e &s;en|timents
it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he would hear
the con&s;piracy without emotion. She was &s;hocked
at the treacherous barbarity of Gam, and &s;hud|dered
at the pro&s;pect of the danger to which Pe|regrine
would be expo&s;ed from their malice. She
dur&s;t not communicate this plot to her mother,
becau&s;e &s;he was afraid that lady's unaccountable
aver&s;ion for her fir&s;t-born would hinder her from
interpo&s;ing in his behalf, and con&s;equently render
her a &s;ort of accomplice in the guilt of his a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins.
She therefore re&s;olved to warn Peregrine
of the con&s;piracy, an account of which &s;he tran&s;|mitted
to him in an affectionate letter, by means
of a young gentleman in that neighbourhood,
who made his addre&s;&s;es to her at that time, and
<PB N="250" REF="258">
who, at her reque&s;t, offered his &s;ervice to our
hero, in de$eating the projects of his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>Peregrine was &s;tartled when he read the parti|culars
of their &s;cheme, which was no other than
an intention to &s;ally upon him when he &s;hould
be altogether unprovided again&s;t &s;uch an attack,
cut off his ears, and otherwi&s;e mutilate him in
&s;uch a manner, that he &s;hould have no cau&s;e to
be vain of his per&s;on for the future.</P>
<P>Incen&s;ed as he was again&s;t the brutal di&s;po&s;i|tion
of his own father's &s;on, he could not help
being moved at the integrity and tenderne&s;s of
his &s;i&s;ter, of who&s;e inclinations towards him he
had been hitherto kept in ignorance. He thanked
the gentleman for his honourable dealing, and
expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of being better acquainted with
his virtues; told him, that now he was cautioned,
he hoped there would be no nece&s;&s;ity for giving
him any further trouble, and wrote by him a
letter of acknolwedgment to his &s;i&s;ter, for whom
he expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t love and regard, be|&s;eeching
her to favour him with an interview be|fore

of &s;lander, which would have exerted

&s;et Pipes at work to forward the prepa|rations.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Pickle having de&s;cribed the &s;pot which

&s;hould come and give them intelligence when the
ambu&s;cade was laid; and in con&s;equence of that
information, they would &s;teal &s;oftly towards the

and draw a large net over the con&s;pi|rators,

<P>The plan being thus dige&s;ted, and the com|modore
made acquainted with the whole affair,
the &s;py was &s;ent upon duty, and every body
within doors prepared to go forth upon the fir&s;t

them that he had perceived three men &s;kulk|ing
behind the hedge, on the road that led to
the publick hou&s;e from which Peregrine and the
lieutenant u&s;ed every night to return about that
hour. Upon this intelligence the confederates
&s;et out immediately with all their implements,
and approaching the &s;cene with as little noi&s;e as
po&s;&s;ible, they heard the &s;ound of blows; and
though the night was dark, perceived a &s;ort of
tumultuous conflict on the very &s;pot which the
con&s;pirators had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Surpri&s;ed at this oc|currence,
the meaning of which he could not
comprehend, Peregrine ordered his myrmidons
<PB N="252" REF="260">
to halt and reconnoitre; and immediately his ears
were &s;aluted with an exclamation of &startq;You
&s;han't &s;cape me, ra&s;scal.&endq; The voice being quite
familiar to him, he all at once divined the cau&s;e

running up to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the exclaimer,
found a fellow on his knees begging his life of
Mr. Gauntlet, who &s;tood over him with a naked
hanger in his hand.</P>
<P>Pickle in&s;tantly made him&s;elf known to his
friend, who told him, that having left his hor&s;e
at Tunley's, he was in his way to the gari&s;on &s;et

his head, which however he mi&s;&s;ed, and the in|&s;trument
de&s;cended on his left &s;houlder; that up|on
drawing his hanger, and laying abut him in

whom he had di&s;abled, in the lurch.</P>
<P>Peregrine congratulated him upon his &s;afety,
and having ordered Pipes to &s;ecure the pri&s;oner,
conducted Mr. Gauntlet to the gari&s;on, where he
met with a very hearty reception from the com|modore,
to whom he was introduced as his ne|phew's
intimate friend; not but that, in all like|lihood,
he would have abated &s;omewhat of his
ho&s;pitality, had he known that he was the bro|ther
of Perry's mi&s;tre&s;s; but her name the old
gentleman had never thought of a&s;king, when
he inquired into the particulars of his god&s;on's
amour.</P>
<P>The captive being examined, in pre&s;ence of
Tr$nnion and all his adherents, touching the am|bu&s;cade,
owned, that being in the &s;ervice of
G$m Pickle, he had been prevailed upon by the
<PB N="253" REF="261">
&s;ollicitations of his ma&s;ter and the curate, to ac|company
them in their expedition, and under|take
the part which he had acted again&s;t the
&s;tranger, whom he and his employers mi&s;took
for Peregrine. In con&s;ideration of this frank ac|knowledgment,
and a &s;evere wound he had re|ceived
in his right arm, they re&s;olved to inflict
no other puni&s;hment on this malefactor, than to
detain him all night in the gari&s;on, and next
morning carry him before a ju&s;tice of the peace,
to whom he repeated all that he had &s;aid over|night,
and with his own hand &s;ub&s;cribed his con|fe&s;&s;ion,
copies of which were handed about the
neighbourhood, to the un&s;peakable confu&s;ion and
di&s;grace of the curate and his promi&s;ing pupil.</P>
<P>Mean while, Trunnion treated the young &s;ol|dier
with uncommon marks of re&s;pect, being pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
in his favour by this adventure, which
he had &s;o gallantly atchieved, as well as by the
encomiums that Peregrine be&s;towed upon his va|lour
and genero&s;ity. He liked his countenance,
which was bold and hardy, admired his Hercu|lean
limbs, and delighted in a&s;king que&s;tions con|cerning
the &s;ervice he had &s;een.</P>
<P>The day after his arrival, while the conver&s;a|tion
turned on this la&s;t &s;ubject, the commodore,
taking the pipe out of his mouth, &startq;I'll tell you
what, brother, (&s;aid he) five and forty years ago,
when I was third lieutenant of the Warwick
man of war, there was a very &s;tout young fel|low
on board, a &s;ubaltern officer of marines;
his name was not unlike your own, d'ye &s;ee,
being Guntlet, with a G. I remember he and
I could not abide one another at fir&s;t, becau&s;e,
d'ye &s;ee, I was a &s;ailor and he a land-man, till
we fell in with a Frenchman, whom we engaged
<PB N="254" REF="262">
for eight gla&s;&s;es, and at length boarded and
took. I was the fir&s;t man that &s;tood on the
enemy's deck, and &s;hould have come &s;curvily
off, d'ye &s;ee, if Guntlet had not jumped to my
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but we &s;oon cleared &s;hip, and drove
them to clo&s;e quarters, &s;o that they were obliged
to &s;trike; and from that day Guntlet and I were
&s;worn brothers as long as he remained on board.
He was exchanged into a marching regiment,
and what became of him afterwards, Lord in
heaven knows; but this I'll &s;ay of him, whether
he be dead or alive, he feared no man that ever
wore a head, and was, moreover, a very hearty
me&s;&s;mate.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;tranger's brea&s;t glowed at this eulogium,
which was no &s;ooner pronounced, than he ea|gerly
a&s;ked, if the French &s;hip was not the Di|ligence?
The commodore replied with a &s;tare,
&startq;The very &s;ame, my lad.&endq; &startq;Then (&s;aid
Gauntlet) the per&s;on of whom you are plea&s;ed
to make &s;uch honourable mention was my own
father.&endq; &startq;The devil he was! (cried Trun|nion,
&s;haking him by the hand) I am rejoiced
to &s;ee a &s;on of Ned Gauntlet in my hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>This di&s;covery introduced a thou&s;and que&s;tions,
in the cour&s;e of which, the old gentleman learnt
the &s;ituation of his friend's family, and di&s;charged
innumerable execrations upon the ingratitude and
inju&s;tice of the mini&s;try, which had failed to pro|vide
for the &s;on of &s;uch a brave &s;oldier. Nor
was h$s friend&s;hip confined to &s;uch in$ffectual ex|pre&s;&s;ions;
he that &s;ame evening &s;ignified to Pe|regrine
a de&s;ire of doing &s;omething for his friend;
and this inclination was &s;o much prai&s;ed, en|couraged
and promoted by his god&s;on, and even
&s;upported by his coun&s;ellor Hatchway, that our
<PB N="255" REF="263">
hero was empowered to pre&s;ent him with a &s;um
of money &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e a commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Though nothing could be more agreeable to
Pickle than this permi&s;&s;ion, he was afraid that
Godfrey's &s;crupulous di&s;po&s;ition would hinder
him from &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to any &s;uch obliga|tion;
and therefore propo&s;ed that he &s;hould be
decoyed into his own intere&s;t by a feigned &s;tory,
in con&s;equence of which he would be prevailed
upon to accept of the money, as a debt which
the commodore had contracted of his father at
&s;ea. Trunnion made wry faces at this expedient,
the nece&s;&s;ity of which he could not conceive,
without calling in que&s;tion the common &s;en&s;e of
Gauntlet, as he took it for granted, that &s;uch
offers as tho&s;e were not to be rejected on any
con&s;ideration whatever. Be&s;ides, he could not
dige&s;t an artifice, by which he him&s;elf mu&s;t own
that he had lived &s;o many years, without mani|fe&s;ting
the lea&s;t intention of doing ju&s;tice to his
creditor. All the&s;e objections, however, were
removed by the zeal and rhetoric of Peregrine,
who repre&s;ented that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to
befriend him on any other terms; that his &s;ilence
hitherto would be imputed to his want of infor|mation
touching the circum&s;tances and condition
of his friend; and that his remembring and in|&s;i&s;ting
upon di&s;charging the obligation, after &s;uch
an interval of time, when the whole affair was
in oblivion, would be the greate&s;t compliment
he could pay to his own honour and integrity.</P>
<P>Thus per&s;uaded, he took an opportunity of
Gauntlet's being alone with him to broach the
affair, telling the young man, that his father had
advanced a &s;um of money for him, when they
&s;ailed together, on account of the me&s;s, as well
<PB N="256" REF="264">
as to &s;top the mouth of a clamorous creditor at
Port&s;mouth; and that the &s;aid &s;um, with in|tere&s;t,
amounted to about four hundred pounds,
which he would now, with great thankfulne&s;s,
repay.</P>
<P>Godfrey was amazed at this declaration, and
after a con&s;iderable pau&s;e replied, that he had
never heard his parents mention any &s;uch debt;
that no memorandum or voucher of it was found
among his father's papers; and that, in all proba|bility,
it mu&s;t have been di&s;charged long ago, al|though
the commodore, in &s;uch a long cour&s;e of
time and hurry of occupation, might have forgot
the repayment: he therefore de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed
from accepting what in his own con&s;cience he be|lieved
was not his due; and complimented the
old gentleman upon his being &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly ju&s;t
and honourable.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier's refu&s;al, which was matter of
a&s;toni&s;hment to Trunnion, increa&s;ed his inclina|tion
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; and, on pretence of acquitting
his own character, he urged his beneficence with
&s;uch ob&s;tinacy, that Gauntlet, afraid of di&s;obliging
him, was in a manner compelled to receive a
draught for the money, for which he &s;ub&s;cribed
an ample di&s;charge, and immediately tran&s;mitted
the order to his mother, whom at the &s;ame time
he informed of the circum&s;tances by which they
had &s;o unexpectedly gained this acce&s;&s;ion of for|tune.</P>
<P>Such a piece of news could not fail of being
agreeable to Mrs. Gauntlet, who by the fir&s;t po&s;t
wrote a polite letter of acknowledgment to the
commodore, another to her own &s;on, importing,
that &s;he had already &s;ent the draught to a friend
in London, with directions to depo&s;it it in the
<PB N="257" REF="265">
hands of a certain banker, for the purcha&s;e of
the fir&s;t en&s;igncy to be &s;old; and &s;he took the
liberty of &s;ending a third to Peregrine, couched
in very affectionate terms, with a kind po&s;t&s;cript,
&s;igned by Mi&s;s Sophy and his charming Emily.</P>
<P>This affair being tran&s;acted to the &s;atisfaction
of all concerned, preparations were &s;et on foot
for the departure of our hero, on whom his uncle
&s;ettled an annuity of eight hundred pounds, being
little le&s;s than one half of his whole income.
By this time indeed the old gentleman could
ea&s;ily afford to alienate &s;uch a part of his fortune,
becau&s;e he entertained little or no company, kept
few &s;ervants, was remarkably plain and frugal in
his hou&s;e-keeping; and Mrs. Trunnion being
now &s;ome years on the wrong &s;ide of fifty, her
infirmities began to increa&s;e; and tho' her pride
had &s;uffered no diminution, her vanity was alto|gether
&s;ubdued by her avarice.</P>
<P>A Swi&s;s valet de chambre, who had already
made the tour of Europe, was hired for the care
of Peregrine's own per&s;on; and Pipes being ig|norant
of the French language, as well as other|wi&s;e
unfit for the office of a fa&s;hionable attendant,
it was re&s;olved that he &s;hould remain in gari&s;on,
and his place was immediately &s;upplied by a Pari|&s;ian
lacquey engaged at London for that purpo&s;e.
Pipes did not &s;eem to reli&s;h this di&s;po&s;ition of
things; and though he made no verbal objections
to it, looked remarkably &s;our at his &s;ucce&s;&s;or upon
his fir&s;t arrival; but this &s;ullen fit &s;eemed gra|dually
to wear off; and long before his ma&s;ter's
departure, he had recovered his natural tranquil|lity
and unconcern.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The two young gentlemen di&s;play their talents for
gallantry, in the cour&s;e of which they are in|volved
in a ludicrous circum&s;tance of di&s;tre&s;s, and
afterwards take vengeance on the author of their
mi&s;hap.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN while our hero and his new friend,
together with hone&s;t Jack Hatchway,
made daily excur&s;ions into the country, vi&s;ited
the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, and fre|quently
accompanied them to the chace; all three
being exceedingly care&s;&s;ed on account of their
talents, which could accommodate them&s;elves
with great facility to the tempers and turns of
their entertainers. The lieutenant was a droll in
his way, Peregrine po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great fund of
&s;prightline&s;s and good humour, and Godfrey, a|mong
his other qualifications already recited,
&s;ung a mo&s;t excellent &s;ong; &s;o that the company
of this triumvirate was courted in all parties, whe|ther
male or female; and if the hearts of our
young gentlemen had not been pre-engaged, they
would have met with opportunities in abundance
of di&s;playing their addre&s;s in the art of love; not
but that they gave a loo&s;e to their gallantry with|out
much intere&s;ting their affections, and amu&s;ed
them&s;elves with little intrigues, which, in the
opinion of a man of plea&s;ure, do not affect his
fidelity to the acknowledged &s;overeign of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Had they u&s;ed tho&s;e advantages which their
&s;kill and accompli&s;hments gave them over the
warm unpracti&s;ed minds of the young ladies to
whom they had acce&s;s, almo&s;t every family in the
<PB N="259" REF="267">
county, might have had cau&s;e to rue their ac|quaintance;
but our adventurers, wild and licen|tious
as they were, governed their actions by cer|tain
notions of honour, which they never pre|&s;umed
to infringe, and therefore, no dome&s;tic
tragedies took ri&s;e from their behaviour.</P>
<P>Among the lower cla&s;s of people, they did not
act with the &s;ame virtuous moderation, but laid
clo&s;e &s;iege to every buxom country dam&s;el that
fell in their way; imagining that their dalliance
with &s;uch Dulcineas could produce no fatal ef|fects;
and that it would be in their power to at|tone
for any damage the&s;e inamorata's might
&s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of the&s;e amours, Gauntlet
could not help di&s;covering a particular bia&s;s to|wards
married women, and when que&s;tioned by
his friend, defended his &s;ingularity of ta&s;te, by
ob&s;erving that &s;uch connections, if di&s;creetly ma|naged,
are attended by none of tho&s;e bad con&s;e|quences
which commonly pur&s;ue an amorous cor|re&s;pondence
with &s;ingle per&s;ons; becau&s;e the
wedded dame's fortune is already made, and her
hu&s;band &s;tands as a buttre&s;s before her reputation.</P>
<P>Though Peregrine could not approve of this
maxim which the &s;oldier had adopted in the cour&s;e
of a military education, he could not avoid en|gaging
as a &s;econd and confidant to his friend, in
an intrigue which he carried on with a farmer's
wife in the neighbourhood. Godfrey had prac|ti&s;ed
all his arts in attempting to overcome the
cha&s;tity of this woman, who was an hale ro&s;y
wench, lately married; and at length &s;ucceeded
&s;o far in his addre&s;&s;es, that &s;he promi&s;ed to admit
him one night when her hu&s;band would be ab&s;ent
<PB N="260" REF="268">
on bu&s;ine&s;s, which called him once a fortnight
to the next market town.</P>
<P>He communicated his good fortune to Perry,
de&s;iring that he would accompany him to the
place, in ca&s;e of accident; and our young gentle|man
having undertaken the office of &s;tanding
centinel over his friend, while he &s;hould enjoy
his conque&s;t, they &s;et out at the time appointed,
and arriving at the door, the gallant made the
&s;ignal which had been agreed upon, and was let
in accordingly, after having a&s;&s;ured his confidant
that he would be with him again in two hours at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus left to his own meditations, our hero be|gan
his patrole, beguiling the time with the mo&s;t
amu&s;ing fancies of a glowing imagination, and
enjoying by anticipation all the plea&s;ures attend|ing
affluence and youth, till at length his rever&s;e
was interrupted by a plump &s;hower that compelled
him to &s;eek for &s;helter in a &s;ort of &s;hed, the door
of which &s;tood open to his view. Thither there|fore
he betook him&s;elf, and groping about as he
entered in the dark, chanced to lay hold on a
bu&s;hy beard, to his infinite &s;urprize and con&s;terna|tion.
Before he had time to form any conjecture
concerning this &s;trange object of his touch, he
received a &s;udden &s;hock upon his forehead that
felled him to the ground in an in&s;tant, and as he
lay, underwent the trampling of a huge body that
ru&s;hed over him into the field. In this attitude he
remained extended for the &s;pace of &s;everal mi|nutes,
before he recovered the u&s;e of &s;en&s;ation
which he had lo&s;t, and then he perceived the
blood trickling down from his temples in a double
&s;tream. The cau&s;e of this misfortune was &s;till a
my&s;tery to him, and he made &s;hift to ri&s;e, cur&s;|ing
<PB N="261" REF="269">
his fate for having &s;u&s;tained &s;uch vi&s;ible marks
of di&s;grace in the exerci&s;e of &s;uch a ridiculous of|fice;
when &s;trolling about with his handkerchief
applied to his hurts, he di&s;cerned on the farther
&s;ide of a tree a pair of large eyes glancing like
two coals of fire. He immediately un&s;heathed his
hanger, in the belief that now he had found the
author of his mi&s;chance; and &s;pringing forward
on his adver&s;ary, aimed a furious &s;troke that en|tered
the body of the tree, in which his weapon
&s;tuck &s;o fa&s;t, that he could not di&s;engage it with|out
&s;ome difficulty; while the object of his wrath
made a precipitate retreat, and by an exclama|tion,
gave him to know that his a&s;&s;ailant was no
other than an he-goat.</P>
<P>Mad as he was with indignation and &s;hame, he
could not help laughing at the ludicrous adven|ture,
and had ju&s;t &s;et his invention at work to
find &s;ome plau&s;ible excu&s;e which he might make
to the world, for the patches he knew he mu&s;t
wear on his face, when a window of the fir&s;t
&s;tory flying open, he &s;aw &s;omething white de|&s;cend
with a&s;toni&s;hing velocity, and running to
the &s;pot, found his friend Godfrey naked to the
&s;hirt. Confounded at his condition, he began to
inquire into the rea&s;on of his precipitation, but
received no an&s;wer until he had followed the fu|gitive
to a place where they could not be over|heard.
There he under&s;tood that the &s;oldier had
been decoyed into the &s;nare by the connivance of
the hu&s;band, by who&s;e direction he had (without
all doubt) been admitted not only into the hou&s;e,
but even into his wife's own bed, where the jilt
had left him undre&s;&s;ed, on pretence of fa&s;tening
the doors, but in reality with a view of giving the
hint to the farmer, who armed with a pitchfork
<PB N="262" REF="270">
and &s;upported by his man, entered the room be|fore
he was aware, &s;ecured his &s;word and cloaths,
and obliged him to take refuge in clo&s;et, from
the window of which he had thrown him&s;elf, in
order to avoid the re&s;entment of the boor, and
the di&s;grace as well as expence of being taken in
that &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Peregrine was tempted to laugh at the ridicu|lous
i&s;&s;ue of this adventure, but re&s;trained him|&s;elf
in con&s;ideration of his friend's temper and
condition, neither of which were at that time
proper objects of mirth; and &s;tripping off his own
coat, accommodated Godfrey's naked &s;houlders;
then after mature deliberation, they determined
to leave the &s;poil in the hands of the enemy, be|cau&s;e
they fore&s;aw it would be altoghether imprac|ticable
to retrieve it, as well as hazardous both
to their per&s;on and reputation, to make any at|tempt
towards the recovery of what was lo&s;t;
the two friends, therefore, made their retreat in
this trim to the gari&s;on, and the farmer remained
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the &s;oldier's cloaths, &s;word and
ready money, to the amount of ten pounds. But
here the di&s;a&s;ter did not end, the malicious pea|&s;ant
propagated the whole &s;tory in the neighbour|hood,
and an adverti&s;ement was pa&s;ted on the
church door, for the peru&s;al of the whole pari&s;h,
giving a de&s;cription of the goods, &s;ignifying the
place where they were found, and offering to
re&s;tore them to any per&s;on who &s;hould prove
him&s;elf the right owner. This was a mortifying
joke to Gauntlet, who was a&s;hamed to &s;hew
him&s;elf for a whole week; nor was Peregrine
exempted from a &s;hare of the di&s;grace, to which
he was expo&s;ed by the marks on his forehead,
that confined him al&s;o to the hou&s;e, and &s;ubjected
<PB N="263" REF="271">
him to the ridicule of the commodore, who hav|ing
heard the &s;tory, rallied the two adventurers,
ob&s;erving that it was well Gauntlet's ma&s;t had
not gone along with his rigging; and a&s;king if
the cockold's horns had run foul of Peregrine's
bows. Mrs. Trunnion, who chanced to be pre|&s;ent,
very demurely checked her hu&s;band for his
profane &s;coffing, and in a &s;evere lecture, rebuked
the young men for their profligate cour&s;es, which,
if they were not relinqui&s;hed in time, would
bring their bodies into trouble in this life, and
their &s;ouls into perdition in that which is to come.
While the&s;e fellow-&s;ufferers were obliged to keep
within doors, they held frequent con&s;ultations
with the lieutenant, concerning &s;ome means of
revenge, which the &s;oldier was bent upon taking;
becau&s;e he could not forgive the double dealing of
his mi&s;tre&s;s, who, he thought, might have de|clined
his &s;olicitations, without inveigling him
into &s;uch a di&s;graceful &s;ituation. After much de|liberation,
they re&s;olved to wait patiently, and
watch for the hu&s;band's ab&s;ence, when by a &s;tra|tagem
they had concerted, they would endea|vour
to obtain admittance$ and puni&s;h the wife's
perfidy, by fixing her as a monument,with her
po&s;teriors thr$&s;t out at a window, for the con|templation
of her &s;pou&s;e when he &s;hould return
in the morning.</P>
<P>The plan being laid, Peregrine found means
to make him&s;elf acquainted with the farmer's
voice and manner of &s;peaking, which he over|heard
one night at Tunley's; and likewi&s;e to
procure information of the day upon which he
always went to a certain market, in order to di&s;|po&s;e
of his wheat, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that he
&s;eldom failed of being abroad all night. Accord|ing
<PB N="264" REF="272">
to this intelligence, the confederates attended
by Pipes, &s;et out one evening about nine o'clock
for the hou&s;e of the delinquent, where the lieu|tenant
and Tom being placed at different ave|nues
to prevent interruption, the two young gen|tlemen
approached the door which was locked,
and Peregrine in the ru&s;tic tone of the farmer de|manded
entrance; the wife never doubting that
her hu&s;band was returned, in con&s;equence of
having met with a &s;peedier &s;ale than u&s;ual, &s;ent
her maid to let him in, and the door was no
&s;ooner opened, than our adventurers ru&s;hed into
the hou&s;e. The mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;truck dumb with
con&s;ternation, mi&s;taking them for robbers, be|cau&s;e
they wore vizors, and were otherwi&s;e di&s;|gui&s;ed;
while the &s;ervant wench, terrified with
the &s;ame apprehen&s;ion, fell upon her knees, and
begged they would &s;pare her life and take all &s;he
had. Gauntlet taking the wife by the hand, led
her trembling into that very chamber which had
been the &s;cene of his misfortune, where pulling
off his ma&s;k, he upbraided her with the treachery
&s;he had practi&s;ed upon him, and intimated the
intention of his pre&s;ent vi&s;it. The lady a&s;ked
pardon for what &s;he had done with &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion,
and deprecated his wrath &s;o pathetically,
that his heart relented, and he propo&s;ed terms of
accommodation, which with &s;ome &s;eeming re|luctance
&s;he embraced, and he forthwith enjoyed
a more agreeable revenge than that which he in
his ire had projected.</P>
<P>Mean while Peregrine gue&s;&s;ing the good for|tune
of his friend, and allured by the attractions
of the maid, who was a cleanly florid girl, em|ployed
his addre&s;s to &s;uch effectual purpo&s;e, that
<PB N="265" REF="273">
&s;he yielded to his efforts; and he was as happy as
&s;uch a conque&s;t could make him.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier and his companion having thus ob|tained
all the &s;atisfaction they required, and fet|tled

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine has an interview with his &s;i&s;ter Julia.
Is interrupted and attacked by his mother, and
relieved by his friend Gauntlet. Julia is &s;ettled
in the gari&s;on, and Trunnion affronted by his
old friend Gamaliel Pickle.</HEAD>
<P>TWO days after this atchievement was &s;o
happily accompli&s;hed, our here received
an intimation from his &s;i&s;ter, that &s;he &s;hould be
overjoyed to meet him next day, at five o'clock
in the afternoon, at the hou&s;e of her nur&s;e, who
lived in a cottage hard by her father's habitation,
&s;he being debarred from all opportunity of &s;eeing
him in any other place by the &s;everity of her mo|ther,
who &s;u&s;pected her inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="274">
He accordingly obeyed the &s;ummons, and went
at the time appointed to the place of rendezvous,
where he met this affectionate young lady, who
when he entered the room, ran towards him with
ail the eagerne&s;s of tran&s;port; flung her arms
about his neck, and &s;hed a flood of tears in his
bo&s;om before &s;he could utter one word, except a
repetition of my dear, dear brother! He em|braced
her with all the piety of fraternal tender|ne&s;s,
wept over her in his turn, a&s;&s;ured her that
this was one of the happie&s;t moments of his life,
and kindly thanked her for having re&s;i&s;ted the
example, and di&s;obeyed the injunctions of his
mother's unnatural aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was ravi&s;hed to find by her conver&s;ation,
that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;hare of &s;en&s;ibility and
prudent reflexion; for &s;he lamented the in&s;atua|tion
of her parents with the mo&s;t filial regret, and
expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch abhorrence and concern at the vil|lainous
di&s;po&s;ition of her younger brother, as a
humane &s;i&s;ter may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have enter|tained.
He made her acquainted with all the cir|cum&s;tances
of his own fortune, and as he &s;up|po&s;ed
&s;he &s;pent her time very di&s;agreeably at
home, among characters which mu&s;t be &s;hock|ingly
intere&s;ting, profe&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of moving her
into &s;ome other &s;phere, where &s;he could live with
more tranquillity and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>She objected to this propo&s;al as an expedient
that would infallibly &s;ubject her to implaca$le
re&s;entment of her mother, who&s;e favour and af|fection
&s;he at pre&s;ent enjoyed but in a very in|con&s;iderable
degree; and they had canva&s;&s;ed di|vers
&s;chemes of corre&s;ponding for the future when
the voice of Mrs. Pickle was heard at the door.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Julv (that was the young lady's name)
finding her&s;elf betrayed, was &s;eized with a vio|lent
<PB N="267" REF="275">
agitation of fear, and Peregrine &s;carce had
time to encourage her with a promi&s;e of protec|tion&punc;
before the door of the apartment being flung
open, this irreconcileable parent ru&s;hed in, and
with a furious a&s;pect flew directly at her trem|bling
daughter, when the &s;on interpo&s;ing, re|ceived
the fir&s;t di&s;charge of her fury.</P>
<P>Her eyes gleamed with all the rage of indigna|tion,
which choaked up her utterance, and &s;eemed
to convul&s;e her whole frame; &s;he twi&s;ted her left
hand in his hair, and with the other buffeted him
about the face, till the blood gu&s;hed from his no|&s;trils
and mouth; while he defended his &s;i&s;ter
from the cruelty of Gam, who a&s;&s;aulted her
from another quarter, &s;eeing his brother en|gaged.
This attack la&s;ted &s;everal minutes with
great violence, till at length Peregrine finding
him&s;elf in danger of being overpowered, if he
&s;hould remain any longer on the defen&s;ive, laid
his brother on his back; and before he could get
up again, di&s;entangled his mother's hand from his
own hair, and having pu&s;hed her gently out of
the room, bolted the door on the in&s;ide; then
turning to Gam, threw him out at the window,
among a parcel of hogs that fed under it. By
this time, Julia was almo&s;t quite di&s;tracted with
terror; &s;he knew &s;he had offended beyond all
h$pe of forgivene&s;s, and from that moment con|&s;idered
her&s;elf as an exile from her father's hou&s;e;
in vain did her brother &s;trive to con&s;ole her with
fre&s;h prote&s;tations of love and protection, &s;he
counted her&s;elf extremely mi&s;erable in being
obliged to endure the eternal re&s;entment of a pa|rent
with whom &s;he had hitherto lived, and
dreaded the cen&s;ure of the world, which from
her mother's mi&s;repre&s;entation &s;he was &s;en&s;ible
would condemn her unheard. That &s;he might not
<PB N="268" REF="276">
however neglect any means in her power of a|verting
this &s;torm, &s;he re&s;olved to appea&s;e, if po&s;|&s;ible,
her mother's wrath with humiliation, and
even appeal to the influence of her father, weak
as it was, before &s;he would de&s;pair of being for|given.
But the good lady &s;pared her this unne|ce&s;&s;ary
application, by telling her through the
key-hole, that &s;he mu&s;t never expect to come
within her father's door again; for from that hour
&s;he renounced her as unworthy of her affection
and regard. Julia weeping bitterly, endeavoured
to &s;often the rigour of this &s;entence, by the mo&s;t
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and rea&s;onable remon&s;trances; but as in
her vindication &s;he of nece&s;&s;ity e&s;pou&s;ed her elder
brother's cau&s;e, her endeavours in&s;tead of &s;oothing,
&s;erved only to exa&s;perate her mother to an higher
pitch of indignation, which di&s;charged it&s;elf in in|vectives
again&s;t Peregrine, whom &s;he reviled with
the epithets of worthle&s;s abandoned reprobate.</P>
<P>The youth hearing the&s;e unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ions,
trembled with re&s;entment through every limb,
a&s;&s;uring the upbraider that he con&s;idered her as an
object of compa&s;&s;ion; &startq;for without all doubt,
&s;aid he, your diabolic rancour mu&s;t be &s;everely
puni&s;hed by the thorns of your own con&s;cience,
which this very in&s;tant taxes you with the malice
and fal&s;ehood of your reproaches. As for my
&s;i&s;ter, I ble&s;s God that you have not been able to
infect her with your unnatural prejudice, which
becau&s;e &s;he is too ju&s;t, too virtuous, too humane
to imbibe, you reject her as an alien to your
blood, and turn her out unprovided into a bar|barous
world. But even there your vitious pur|po&s;e
&s;hall be defeated; that &s;ame providence that
&s;creened me from the cruelty of your hate &s;hall ex|tend
its protection to her, until I &s;hall find it con|venient
to a&s;&s;ert by law that right of maintenance
<PB N="269" REF="277">
which nature, it &s;eems, hath be&s;towed upon us in
vain. In the mean time, you will enjoy the &s;ati&s;|faction
of paying an undivided attention to that dar|ling
&s;on, who&s;e amiable qualities have &s;o long en|gaged
and engro&s;&s;ed your love and e&s;teem.&endq;</P>
<P>This freedom of expo&s;tulation exalted his
mother's ire to meer frenzy; &s;he cur&s;ed him with
the bittere&s;t imprecations, and raved like a Bed|lamite
at the door, which &s;he attempted to bur&s;t
open. Her efforts were &s;econded by her favourite
&s;on, who denounced vengeance again&s;t Peregrine,
made furious a&s;&s;aults again&s;t the lock, which re|&s;i&s;ted
all their applications, until our hero e&s;pying
his friend Gauntlet and Pipes &s;tepping over a
&s;tyle that &s;tood about a $urlong from the window,
called them to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and giving them to
under&s;tand how he was be&s;ieged, de&s;ired they
would keep off his mother, that he might the
more ea&s;ily &s;ecure his &s;i&s;ter Julia's retreat. The
young &s;oldier entered accordingly, and po&s;ting
him&s;elf between Mrs. Pickle and door, gave
the &s;ignal to his friend, who lifting up his &s;i&s;ter
in his arms, carried her &s;afe without the clutches
of this &s;he-dragon, while Pipes with his cudgel
kept young ma&s;ter at bay.</P>
<P>The mother being thus deprived of her prey,
&s;prung upon Gauntlet like a lione&s;s robbed of her
whelps, and he mu&s;t have &s;uffered &s;orely in the
fle&s;h, had he not prevented her mi&s;chievous in|tent
by &s;eizing both her wri&s;ts, and &s;o keeping
her at due di&s;tance. In attempting to di&s;engage
her&s;elf from his gra&s;p, &s;he &s;truggled with &s;uch
exertion, and &s;uffered &s;uch agony of pa&s;&s;ion at
the &s;ame time, that &s;he actually fell into a &s;evere
fit, during which &s;he was put to bed, and the
confederates retired without further mole&s;tation.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="278">
In the mean time, Peregrine was not a little
perplexed about the di&s;po&s;al of his &s;i&s;ter whom he
had re&s;cued. He could not endure the thoughts
of &s;addling the commodore with a new expence;
and he was afraid of undertaking the charge of
$ul$a, without his benefactor's advice and $word$|tion:
for the pre&s;ent, however, he carried her
to the hou&s;e of a gentleman in the neighbour|hood,
who&s;e lady was her godmother, where &s;he
was received with great tenderne&s;s and conde|lance;
and he propo&s;ed to inquire for &s;ome credi|table
hou&s;e&punc; where &s;he might be gent$elly boarded
in his a$&s;ence&punc; $word$ to maintain her from the
&s;avi$g of his o$h allowance which he thought
might very well bear &s;uch deduction. But this
intention was $ru&s;trated by the publication of the
whole affair, which was divulged next day, and
&s;oon reached the ears of Trunnion, who chid
his god&s;on for having concealed the adventure;
and, with the approbation of his wife, ordered
him to bring Julia forthwith to the gari&s;on. The
young gentleman, with tears of gratitude in his
eyes, explained his de&s;ign of maintaining her at
his own expence, and earne&s;tly begged that he
might not be deprived of that &s;atisfaction. But
his uncle was deaf to all his intreaties, and in|&s;i&s;ted
upon her living in the gari&s;on, though for
no other rea&s;on than that of being company to
her aunt, who, he ob&s;erved, was lo&s;t for want
of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Julia was accordingly brought home, and &s;et|led
under the tuition of Mrs. Trunnion, who,
whatever face &s;he might put on the matter, could
have di&s;pen&s;ed with the &s;ociety of her niece;
though &s;he was not without hope of gratifying
her pique at Mrs. Pickle, by the intelligence &s;he
would receive from the daughter, of that lady's
<PB N="271" REF="279">
$economy and dome&s;tic behaviour. The mother
her&s;elf &s;eemed con&s;cious of this advantage which
her &s;i&s;ter-in-law had now gained over her, being
as much chagrined at the news of Julia's recep|tion
at the gari&s;on, as if &s;he had heard of her
own hu&s;band's death. She even tortured her in|vention
to propagate calumni$s again&s;t the repu|tation
of her own daughter, whom &s;he &s;landered
in all companies; &s;he exclaimed again&s;t the com|modore
as an old ru&s;&s;ian who &s;pi$ited up a rebel|lion
among her children, and imputed the ho&s;pi|tality
of his wife, in countenancing them&punc; to no|thing
el&s;e but her inveterate enmity to their mo|ther,
whom they had di&s;obliged. She now in|&s;i$$ed,
in the mo&s;t peremptory terms, upon her
hu&s;band's renouncing all commerce with the old
lad of ca&s;tle and his adherents; and Mr. Ga|maliel
having by this time contracted other friend|&s;hips,
readily &s;ubmitted to her will, and even re|fu&s;ed
to communicate with the commodore one
night, when they happened to meet by accident
at the public hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The commodore &s;ends a challenge to Gamaliel, and
is impo&s;ed upon by a waggi&s;h invention of the
lieutenant, Peregrine and Gauntlet.</HEAD>
<P>THIS affront Trunnion could by no means
dige&s;t: he advi&s;ed with the lieutenant upon
the &s;ubject; and the re&s;ult of their con&s;ultation was
a defiance which the old commander &s;ent to Pickle,
demanding that he would meet him at &s;uch a place
on hor&s;eback with a brace of pi&s;tols, and give &s;a|tisfaction
for the &s;light he had put upon him.</P>
<P>Nothing could have afforded more plea&s;ure to
J$ck, than the acceptance of this challenge,
<PB N="272" REF="280">
which he delivered verbally to Mr. Gamaliel,
who was called out from the club at Tunley's
for that purpo&s;e. The nature of this me&s;&s;age
had an in&s;tantaneous effect upon the con&s;titution
of the pacific Pickle, who&s;e bowels yearned with
apprehen&s;ion, and underwent &s;uch violent agitation
on the &s;pot, that one would have thought the ope|ration
proceeded from &s;ome &s;evere joke of the apo|thecary
which he had &s;wallowed in his beer.</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;enger de&s;pairing of a &s;atisfactory an|&s;wer,
left him in this woeful condition; and
being loath to lo&s;e any opportunity of rai&s;ing the
$word$ again&s;t the commodore, went immediately
and communicated the whole affair to the young
gentlemen, intreating them, for the love of God,
to concert &s;ome means of bringing old Hannibal
into the field. The two friends reli&s;hed the pro|po&s;al,
and after &s;ome deliberation, it was re&s;olved
that Hatchway &s;hould tell Trunnion his invitation
was accepted by Gamaliel, who would meet him
at the place appointed, with his &s;econd, to-mor|row
in the twilight, becau&s;e if either &s;hould fall,
the other would have the better chance for e&s;caping
in the dark; that Godfrey &s;hould per&s;onate old
pickle's friend, and Peregrine repre&s;ent his own
father, while the lieutenant &s;hould take care in
loading the pi&s;tols to keep out the &s;hot, &s;o as
that no damage might be done in the rencounter.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances being adju&s;ted, the lieu|tenant
returned to his principal with a mo&s;t thun|dering
reply from his antagoni&s;t, who&s;e coura|geous
behaviour, though it could not intimidate,
did not fail to a&s;toni&s;h the commodore, who a&s;|cribed
it to the &s;pirit of his wife&punc; which had in|&s;pired
him. Trunnion that in&s;tant de&s;ired his
coun&s;ellor to prepare his cartridge-box, and order
the quiete&s;t hor&s;e in the &s;table to be kept ready
<PB N="273" REF="281">
&s;addled for the occa&s;ion; his eye &s;eemed to lighten
with alacrity and plea&s;ure at the pro&s;pect of &s;mell|ing
gun-powder once more before his death; and
when Jack advi&s;ed him to make his will, in ca&s;e
of accident, he rejected his coun&s;el with di&s;dain,
&s;aying, &startq;What! do&s;t think that Haw&s;er Trun|nion,
who has &s;tood the fire of &s;o many floating
batteries, runs any ri&s;k from the lou&s;y pops of a
land-man? Thou &s;halt &s;ee, thou &s;halt &s;ee how
I will make him lower his top-&s;ails.&endq; Next day
Peregrine and the &s;oldier provided them&s;elves with
hor&s;es at the public hou&s;e, from whence, at the
de&s;tined hour, they rode to the field of battle,
each of them being muffled in a great coat, which,
with the dimne&s;s of the light, effectually &s;hielded
them from the knowledge of the one-eyed com|mander,
who having taken hor&s;e, on pretence of
enjoying the fre&s;h air, &s;oon appeared with Hatch|way
in his rear. When they came within &s;ight
of each other, the &s;econds advanced, in order to
divide the ground, and regulate the mea&s;ures of
the combat; when it was determined by mutual
con&s;ent, that two pi&s;tols &s;hould be di&s;charged on
each &s;ide, and that if neither &s;hould prove deci|&s;ive,
recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the broad-&s;words,
in order to a&s;certain the victory. The&s;e articles
being &s;ettled, the opponents rode forward to their
re&s;pective &s;tations, when Peregrine cocking his
pi&s;tol, and pre&s;enting, counterfeited his father's
voice, and bad Trunnion take care of his re|maining
eye. The commodore took his advice,
being unwilling to hazard his day-light, and very
deliberately oppo&s;ed the patched &s;ide of his face
to the muzzle of his antagoni&s;t's piece, de&s;iring
him to do his duty without further jaw. The
young man accordingly fired, and the di&s;tance be|ing
&s;mall, the wad of his pi&s;tol took place with a
<PB N="274" REF="282">
&s;mart &s;troke on the forehead of Trunnion, who
mi&s;taking it for the ball, which he thought was
lodged in his brain, &s;purred up his &s;teed in a &s;tate
of de&s;peration towards his antagoni&s;t, and holding
his piece within two yards of his body, let it off,
without any regard to the laws of battle. Sur|pri&s;ed
and enraged to &s;ee it had made no impre&s;|&s;ion,
he hollowed in a terrible tone, &startq;O! damn
ye, you have got your netting &s;tuffed, I &s;ec;&endq;
and advancing, di&s;charged his &s;econd pi&s;tol &s;o near
his god&s;on's head, that had he not been defended
by his great coat, the powder mu&s;t have &s;corched
his face. Having thus thrown away his fire, he
remained at the mercy of Peregrine, who clap|ping
the piece he had in re&s;erve to his head,
commanded him to beg his life, and a&s;k pardon
for his pre&s;umption. The commodore made no
reply to this imperious injunction, but dropping
his pi&s;tol, and un&s;heathing his broad-&s;word with
a j$k, attacked our hero with &s;uch incredible agi|l$ty,
that if he had not made &s;hift to ward off the
&s;troke with his piece, the adventure, in all like|lihood,
would have turned out a very tragical
joke. Peregrine finding it would bein vain for
him to think of drawing his weapon, and &s;tading
on the defen&s;ive again&s;t this furious aggre&s;&s;or,
very fairly cl$pt &s;purs to his nag, and &s;ougt his
&s;afety in flight. Trunnion pur&s;ued him with in|finite
eagerne&s;s, and his $word$ being the better of
the two, would have overtaken the fugitive to
his peril, had he not been unfortunately encoun|tered
by the $word$ of a tree that happened to
&s;tand on his blind &s;ide, and incomm$ded him &s;o
much, that he was fain to quit his &s;word, and
lay hold on the m$ne, in order to maintain his
&s;eat. Perry perceiving his di&s;a&s;ter, wheeled about,
and now finding lei&s;ure to produce his weapon,
<PB N="275" REF="283">
returned upon his di&s;armed foe, and brandi&s;hing
his Ferrara, threatened to make him &s;horter by
the head, if he would not immediately crave
quarter, and yield. There was nothing farther
from the intention of the old gentleman than &s;uch
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which he flatly refu&s;ed to pay, alledging
that he had already compelled his enemy to clap
on all his &s;ails, and that his own pre&s;ent misfor|tune
was owing to accident, all one as if a &s;hip
&s;hould be attacked, after &s;he had been obliged to
heave her guns over-board in a &s;torm.</P>
<P>Before Peregrine had time to an&s;wer this re|mon&s;trance,
the lieutenant interpo&s;ed, and taking
cognizance of the ca&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;hed a truce, until
he and the other &s;econd &s;hould di&s;cu&s;s and decide
upon the merits of the cau&s;e. They accordingly
retired to a &s;mall di&s;tance, and after having con|ferred
a few minutes, Hatchway returned, and
pronounced the commodore vanqui&s;hed by the
chance of war.</P>
<P>Never was rage more tran&s;porting than that
which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of old Hannibal, when he
heard the &s;entence; it was &s;ome time before he
could utter aught, except the reproachful expre&s;|&s;ion,
<HI>You lie!</HI> which he repeated more than twenty
times, in a &s;ort of delirious in&s;en&s;ibility; and when
he recovered the further u&s;e of &s;peech, abu&s;ed the
arbitrators with &s;uch bitter invectives, renouncing
their &s;entence, and appealing to another trial, that
the confederates began to repent of having carried
the joke &s;o far; and Peregrine, in order to appea&s;e
his choler, owned him&s;elf overcome.</P>
<P>This acknowledgement calmed the tumult of
his wrath, though he could not for &s;ome days
forgive the lieutenant; and the two young gen|tlemen
rode back to Tunley's while Hatchway,
taking the commodore's hor&s;e by the bridle, re|conducted
<PB N="276" REF="284">
him to his man&s;ion, growling all the
way at Jack for his unju&s;t and unfriendly decree;
though he could not help ob&s;erving, as how he
had made his words good, in making his adver|&s;ary
&s;trike his top-&s;ails: &startq;And yet (&s;aid he) be|fore
God! I think the fellow's head is made of a
wool-pack; for my &s;hot rebounded from his face
like a wad of &s;pun-yarn from the walls of a &s;hip.
But if &s;o be that &s;on of a bitch of a tree hadn't
come athwart my weather-bow, d'ye &s;ee, I'll
be damned if I hadn't &s;napt his main-yard in the
&s;lings, and mayhap let out his bulge water into
the bargain.&endq; He &s;eemed particularly vain of
this exploit, which dwelt upon his imagination,
and was cheri&s;hed as the child of his old age; for
though he could not with decency rehear&s;e it to the
young men and his wife at &s;upper, he gave &s;hrewd
hints of his own manhood, even at the&s;e years, and
atte&s;ted Hatchway as a voucher for his mettle,
while the triumvirate, diverted by his vanity, en|joyed
in &s;ecret the &s;ucce&s;s of their impo&s;ition.</P>

out from the gari&s;on, parts with his uncle and
Hatchway on the road, and with his governor
arrives in &s;afety at Dover.</HEAD>
<P>THIS, however, was the la&s;t effort of in|vention
which they practi&s;ed upon him;
and every thing being now prepared for the de|parture
of his god&s;on, that hopeful youth in two
days took leave of all his friends in the neigh|b$urhood,
was clo&s;eted two whole hours with
his aunt, who inriched him with many pious ad|vices,
recapitulated all the benefits which, through
her means, had been con&s;erred upon him &s;ince
<PB N="277" REF="285">
his infancy, cautioned him again&s;t the tempta|tions
of lewd women, who bring many a man
to a mor&s;el of bread, laid &s;trict injunctions upon
him, to live in the fear of the Lord and the true
prote&s;tant faith, to e&s;chew quarrels and conten|tion,
to treat Mr. Jolter with reverence and re|gard,
and above all things to ab&s;tain from the
bea&s;tly &s;in of drunkenne&s;s, which expo&s;eth a
man to the &s;corn and contempt of his fellow|creatures,
and by dive&s;ting him of rea&s;on and re|flection,
renders him fit for all manner of vice
and debauchery. She recommended to him oeco|nomy
and the care of his health, bad him re|member
the hounour of his family, and in all the
circum&s;tances of his behaviour, a&s;&s;ured him, that
he might always depend upon the friend&s;hip and
genero&s;ity of the commodore; and finally, pre|&s;enting
him with her own picture &s;et in gold,
and an hundred guineas from her privy pur&s;e,
embraced him affectionately, and wi&s;hed him all
manner of happine&s;s and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Being thus kindly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by Mrs. Trunnion,
he locked him&s;elf up with his &s;i&s;ter Julia, whom
he admoni&s;hed to cultivate her aunt with the mo&s;t
complai&s;ant and re&s;pectful attention, without
&s;tooping to any circum&s;tance of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that
&s;he &s;hould judge unworthy of her practice; he
prote&s;ted, that his chief &s;tudy &s;hould be to make
her amends for the privilege &s;he had forfeited
by her affection for him; intreated her to enter
into no engagement without his knowledge and
approbation, put into her hand the pur&s;e which
he had received from his aunt, to defray her
packet expences in his ab&s;ence, and parted from
her, not without tears, after &s;he had for &s;ome
minutes hung about his neck, ki&s;&s;ing him and
weeping in the mo&s;t pathetic &s;ilence.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="286">
Having performed the&s;e duties of affection and
con&s;anguinity over-night, he went to bed, and
was by his own direction, called at four o'clock
in the morning, when he found the po&s;t-chai&s;e,
coach and riding-hor&s;es ready at the gate, his
friends Gauntlet and Hatchway on foot, the com|modore
him&s;elf almo&s;t dre&s;&s;ed, and every &s;ervant
in the gari&s;on a&s;&s;embled in the yard, to wi&s;h him
a good journey. Our hero &s;hook each of the&s;e
humble friends by the hand, tipping them at the
&s;ame time with marks of his bounty; and was
very much &s;urprized when he could not perceive
his old attendant Pipes among the number. When
he expre&s;&s;ed his wonder at this di&s;re&s;pectful omi&s;|&s;ion
of Tom, &s;ome of tho&s;e pre&s;ent ran to his
chamber, in order to give him a call, but his
hammock and room were both de&s;erted,and they
&s;oon returned with an account of his having eloped.
Peregrine was di&s;turbed at this information, be|lieving
that the fellow had taken &s;ome de&s;perate
cour&s;e, in con&s;equence of his being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from
his &s;ervice, and began to wi&s;h that he had indulged
his inclination, by retaining him &s;till about his
per&s;on. However, as there was now no other
remedy, he recommended him &s;trenuou&s;ly to the
particular favour and di&s;tinction of his uncle and
Hatchway, in ca&s;e he &s;hould appear again; and
as he went out at the gate, was &s;aluted with three
chears by all the dome&s;tics in the family. The
commodore, Gauntlet, lieutenant, Peregrine and
Jolter went into the coach together, that they
might enjoy each other's conver&s;ation as much as
po&s;&s;ible, re&s;olving to breakfa&s;t at an inn upon the
road, where Trunnion and Hatchway intended
to bid our adventurer &s;arewel; the valet de cham|bre
got into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, the French lacquey
rode one hor&s;e and led another, one of the valets
<PB N="279" REF="287">
of the gari&s;on mounted at the back of the coach;
and thus the cavalcade &s;et out on the road to Do|ver.
As the commodore could not bear the fa|tigue
of jolting, they travelled at an ea&s;y pace
during the fir&s;t &s;tage; &s;o that the old gentleman
had an opportunity of communicating his exhor|tations
to his god&s;on, with regard to his conduct
abroad; he advi&s;ed him, now that he was going
into foreign parts, to be upon his guard again&s;t
the fair weather of the French polite&s;&s;e, which
was no more to be tru&s;ted than a whirlpool at &s;ea.
He ob&s;erved that many young men had gone to
Paris with good cargoes of &s;en&s;e, and returned
with a great deal of canvas, and no balla&s;t at all,
whereby they became crank all the days of their
lives, and &s;ometimes carried their keels above wa|ter.
He de&s;ired Mr. Jolter to keep his pupil out
of the clutches of tho&s;e &s;harking prie&s;ts who lie in
wait to make converts of all young &s;trangers, and
in a particular manner cautioned the youth again&s;t
carnal conver&s;ation with the Pari&s;ian dames, who,
he under&s;tood, were no better than gaudy fire-&s;hips
ready primed with death and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Peregrine li&s;tened with great re&s;pect, thanking
him for his kind admonitions, which he faithfully
promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve. They halted and breakfa&s;ted at
the end of the &s;tage, where Jolter provided him&s;elf
with a hor&s;e, and the commodore &s;ettled the me|thod
of corre&s;ponding with his nephew; and the
minute of parting being arrived, the old comman|der
wrung his god&s;on by the hand, &s;aying, &startq;I
with thee a pro&s;perous voyage and good cheer,
my lad; my timbers are now a little crazy, d'ye
&s;ee; and God knows if I &s;hall keep afloat till
&s;uch time as I &s;ee thee again; but, how&s;omever,
h$p what will, thou wilt find thy&s;elf in a condi|tion
to keep in the line with the be&s;t of thy fol|lows.&endq;;
<PB N="280" REF="288">
He then reminded Gauntlet of his pro|mi&s;e
to call at the gari&s;on in his return from Do|ver,
and imparted &s;omething in a whi&s;per to the
governor, while Jack Hatchway unable to &s;peak,
pulled his hat over his eyes, and &s;queezing Pere|grine
by the hand, gave him an iron pi&s;tol of cu|rious
workman&s;hip, as a memorial of his friend|&s;hip.
Our youth, who was not unmoved on this
occa&s;ion, received the pledge, which he acknow|ledged
with the pre&s;ent of a &s;ilver tobacco-box,
that he had bought for that purpo&s;e; and the two
lads of the ca&s;tle getting into the coach, were
driven homewards, in a &s;tate of &s;ilent dejection.</P>
<P>Godfrey and Peregrine &s;eated them&s;elves in the
po&s;t-chai&s;e, and Jolter, the valet de chambre and
lacquey be&s;triding their bea&s;ts, they proceeded for
the place of their de&s;tination, at which they arrived
in &s;afety that &s;ame night, and be&s;poke a pa&s;&s;age
in the pacqu$t-boat which was to &s;ail next day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He adju&s;ts the method of his corre&s;pondence with
Gauntlet; meets by accident with an Italian
Charlatan, and a certain apothecary, who proves
to be a noted character.</HEAD>
<P>THERE the two friends adju&s;ted the arti|cles
of their future corre&s;pondence, and
Peregrine having written a letter to his mi&s;tre&s;s,
wherein he renewed his former vows of eternal
fidelity, it was intru&s;ted to the care of her bro|ther,
while Mr. Jolter, at the de&s;ire of his pupil,
provided an elegant &s;upper, and &s;ome excellent
Burgundy, that they might &s;pend this eve of his
departure with the greater enjoyment.</P>
<P>Things being thus di&s;po&s;ed,and a &s;ervant em|ployed
in laying the cloth, their ears were of a
<PB N="281" REF="289">
&s;udden invaded by a &s;trange tumultuous noi&s;e in
the next room, occa&s;ioned by the overthrow of
tables, chairs and gla&s;&s;es, with odd unintelligible
exclamations in broken French, and a jargon of
threats in the Wel&s;h dialect. Our young gentle|men
ran immediately into the apartment from
whence this clamour &s;eemed to proceed, and
found a thin meager &s;warthy figure ga&s;ping in all
the agony of fear, under the hands of a &s;quat,
thick, hard-featured man, who collared him with
great demon&s;trations of wrath, &s;aying, &startq;If you
was as mighty a magician as Owen Glendower,
or the witch of Entor, look you, ay, or as Paul
Beor him&s;elf, I will make pole, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of Got, and in his Maje&s;ty's naam, to &s;eize and
&s;ecure, and confine and confront you, until &s;uch
time as you &s;uffer and endure and undergo the pains
and penalties of the law, for your diabolical prac|tices.
Shentlemens, added he, turning to our ad|venturers,
I take you to witne&s;s that I prote&s;t and
a&s;&s;ert and avow that this per&s;on is as pig a necro|mancer
as you would de&s;ire to behold; and I &s;up|plicate
and be&s;eech and intreat of you, that he may
be prought pefore his petters, and compelled to
give an account of his compact and commerce with
the imps of darkne&s;s, look you; for as I am a
chri&s;tian &s;oul, and hope for joyful re&s;urrection,
I have this ple&s;&s;ed evening &s;een him perform &s;uch
things as could not be done without the aid and
in&s;truction and connivance of the Tevil.&endq;</P>
<P>Gauntlet &s;eemed to enter into the &s;entiments
of this Welch reformer, and actually laid hold
on the delinquent's &s;houlder, crying, &startq;Damn
the ra&s;cal! I'll lay any wager that he's a je&s;uit;
for none of his order travel without a familiar.&endq;
But Peregrine, who looked upon the affair in
another point of view, interpo&s;ed in behalf of
<PB N="282" REF="290">
the &s;tranger, whom he freed from his aggre&s;&s;ors,
ob&s;erving that there was no occa&s;ion to u&s;e vio|lence,
and a&s;ked in French what he had done to
incur the cen&s;ure of the informer. The poor fo|reigner,
more dead than alive, an&s;wered that he
was an Italian charlatan, who had practi&s;ed with
&s;ome reputation in Padua. until he had the mi&s;|fortune
to attract the notice of the $nqui&s;ition, by
exhibiting certain wonderful performances by his
&s;kill in natural knowledge, which that tribunal
con&s;idered as the effects of &s;orcery, and pe$&s;e|c$ted
him accordingly; &s;o that he had been fain
to make a precipitate retreat into France, where
not finding his account in his talents, he was
now arrived in England, with a view of prac|ti&s;ing
his art in London; and that in con&s;equence
of a &s;pecimen which he had given to a company
below, the choleric gentleman had followed him
up &s;tairs to his own apartment, and a&s;&s;aulted him
in that inho&s;pitable manner. He therefore ear|ne&s;tly
begged that our hero would take him under
his protection; and if he entertained the lea&s;t
&s;u&s;picion of his employing preternatural means in
the operations of his art, he would freely commu|nicate
all the &s;ecrets in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The youth di&s;pelled his apprehen&s;ion, by a&s;|&s;uring
him that he was in no danger of &s;uffer|ing
for his art in England, where, if ever he
&s;hould be que&s;tioned by the zeal of &s;uper&s;titious
individuals, he had nothing to do but appeal to
the next ju&s;tice of the peace, who would imme|diately
acquit him of the charge, and puni&s;h his
accu&s;ers for their impertinence and indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>He then told Gauntlet and the Wel&s;hman, that
the &s;tranger had a good action again&s;t them for
an a&s;&s;ault, by virtue of an act of parliament,
which makes it criminal for any per&s;on to accu&s;e
<PB N="283" REF="291">
another of &s;orcery and witchcraft, the&s;e idle no|tions
being now ju&s;tly exploded by all &s;en&s;ible
men. Mr. Jolter, who had by this time joined
the company, could not help &s;ignif$ing his di&s;&s;ent
from this opinion of his pupil, which he endea|voured
to invalidate by the authority of &s;cripture,
quotations from the father, and the confe&s;&s;ion of
many wretches who &s;uffered death for having car|ried
on corre&s;pondence with evil &s;pirits, together
with the evidence of Satan's Invi&s;ible World,
and Moreton's hi&s;tory of witchcraft.</P>
<P>The &s;oldier corroborated the&s;e te&s;timonies by
facts that had happened within the &s;phere of his
own knowledge, and in particular mentioned the
ca&s;e of an old woman of the pari&s;h in which he
was born, who u&s;ed to transform her&s;elf into the
&s;hapes of &s;undry animals, and was at la&s;t killed
by &s;mall-&s;hot, in the character of an hare. The
Welchman thus &s;upported, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize
at hearing that the legi&s;lature had &s;hewn &s;uch
tenderne&s;s for criminals of &s;o dark a hue; and
offered to prove by undeniable in&s;tances, that
there was not a mountain in Wales, which had
not been in his memory the &s;cene of necromancy
and witchcraft; &startq;Wherefore, &s;aid he, I am a&s;|&s;uredly
more than apove a&s;toni&s;hed and con|founded
and concerned, that the parliament of
Great Pritain &s;hould in their great wi&s;doms and
their prudence, and their penetration, give coun|tenance
and encouragement, look you, to the
works of darkne&s;s and the empire of Polzepup;
ofer and apove the evidence of holy writ, and
tho&s;e writers who have been quoted by that aggu|rate
and learned &s;hentleman, we are informed
by profane hi&s;tory, of the pribbles and pranks of
the old &s;erpent, in the bortents and oragles of an|tiquity;
as you will find in that mo&s;t excellent
<PB N="284" REF="292">
hi&s;torian Bolypius, and Titus Lifius; ay, and
moreofer, in the commentaries of Julius Cae&s;ar
him&s;elf, who, as the ole 'orld knows, was a mo&s;t
famous, and a mo&s;t faliant, and a mo&s;t wi&s;e, and
a mo&s;t prudent, and a mo&s;t fortunate chei&s;tan,
and a mo&s;t renowned orator; ay, and a mo&s;t
elegant writer to boot.&endq;</P>
<P>Peregrine did not think proper to enter the
li&s;ts of di&s;pute with three &s;uch ob&s;tinate antago|ni&s;ts;
but contented him&s;elf with &s;aying, that he
believed it would be no difficult matter to im|pugn
the arguments they had advanced; though
he did not find him&s;elf at all di&s;po&s;ed to under|take
the ta&s;k, which mu&s;t of cour&s;e break in upon
the evening's entertainment. He therefore invited
the Italian to &s;upper, and a&s;ked the &s;ame favour
of his accu&s;er, who &s;eemed to have &s;omething
curious and characteri&s;tic in his manner and di&s;|po&s;ition,
re&s;olving to make him&s;elf an eye-wit|ne&s;s
of tho&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing feats, which had given
offence to the choleric Briton. This &s;crupulous
gentleman thanked our hero for his courte&s;y, but
declined communicating with the &s;tranger, until
his character &s;hould be further explained; upon
which his inviter, after &s;ome conver&s;ation with the
charlatan, a&s;&s;ured him that he would him&s;elf under|take
for the innocence of his art; and then he was
prevailed upon to favour them with his company.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation, Peregrine
learnt that the Welchman was a &s;urgeon of
Canterbury, who had been called in to a con&s;ul|tation
at Dover, and under&s;tanding that his name
was Morgan, took the liberty of a&s;king if he was
not the per&s;on &s;o re&s;pectfully mentioned in the
Adventures of Roderick Random. Mr. Morgan
a&s;&s;umed a look of gravity and importance at this
interrogation, and &s;crewing up his mouth, an|&s;wered,
<PB N="285" REF="293">
&startq;Mr. Rantum, my goot &s;ir, I believe
upon my con&s;cience and &s;alfation, is my very
goot frient and wellwi&s;her; and he and I have
been companions and me&s;&s;mates and fellow-&s;uf|ferers,
look you; but neverthele&s;s, for all that,
peradventure, he hath not pehaved with &s;o much
complai&s;ance and affability and re&s;pect, as I might
have expected from him; pecau&s;e he hath re|vealed
and tivulged and bupli&s;hed our private af|fairs,
without my knowledge and privity and con|&s;ent;
but as Got is my &s;afiour, I think he had
no evil intention in his pelly; and though there
be certain per&s;ons, look you, who, as I am told,
take upon them to laugh at his de&s;criptions of my
per&s;on, deportment and conver&s;ation, I do af|firm
and maintain, and in&s;i&s;t with my heart, and
my $lood and my &s;oul, that tho&s;e per&s;ons are no
$etter than ignorant a&s;&s;es, and that they know
not how to di&s;cern and di&s;tingui&s;h and define true
ridicule, or as Ari&s;totle calls it, the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, no
more, look you, than a herd of mountain goats;
for I will make $old to ob&s;erve, and I hope this
goot company will be of the &s;ame opinion , that
there is nothing &s;aid of me in that performance,
which is unworthy of a chri&s;tian and a &s;hentleman.&endq;</P>
<P>Our young gentleman and his friends acquie&s;|ced
in the ju&s;tne&s;s of his ob&s;ervation, and Pere|grine
particularly a&s;&s;ured him, that from reading
the book, he had conceived the utmo&s;t regard
and veneration for his character; and that he
thought him&s;elf extremely fortunate in having
this opportunity of enjoying his conver&s;ation.
Morgan, not a little proud of &s;uch advances from
a per&s;on of Peregrine's appearance, returned the
compliment with a profu&s;ion of civility, and in
the warmth of acknowledgement, expre&s;&s;ed a
de&s;ire of &s;eeing him and his company at his hou&s;e
<PB N="286" REF="294">
in Canterbury: &startq;I will not pretend, or pre&s;ume,
kind &s;ir, &s;aid he, to entertain you according to
your merits and de&s;erts; but you &s;hall be as wel|come
to my poor cottage, and my wife and fa|mily,
as the Prince of Wales him&s;elf; and it
&s;hall go hard, if one way or other, I do not find
ways and means of making you con$e&s;s that there
is &s;ome goot fellow&s;hip in an ancient Priton: for
though I am no petter than a &s;imple apothecary,
I have as goot $lood circulating in my veins, as
any he in the county; and I can de&s;cribe and
delineate and demon&s;trate my pedigree to the
&s;atisfaction of the 'ole 'orld; and moreofer, by
Got's goot providence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance&punc; I can af|ford
to treat my friend with a joint of goot mut|ton,
and a $ottle of excellent wine, and no
trade&s;man can peard me with a bill.&endq; He was
congratulated on his happy &s;ituation, and a&s;&s;ured
that our youth would vi&s;it him on his return from
France, provided he &s;hould take Canterbury in
his route; and as Peregrine manife&s;ted an inclina|tion
of being acquainted with the &s;tate of his af|fairs,
he very complai&s;antly &s;atisfied his curio&s;ity,
by giving him to know that his &s;pou&s;e had left off
breeding, after having ble&s;&s;ed him with two boys
and a girl, who were &s;till alive and well; that he
lived in good e&s;teem with his neighbours, and by
his practice, which was con&s;iderably extended
immediately after the publication of Roderick
Random, had &s;aved &s;ome thou&s;and pounds, and
begun to think of retiring among his own rela|tions
in Glamorgan&s;hire, where he had already
pitched upon a &s;pot for his re&s;idence, though his
wife had made objections to this propo&s;al, and
oppo&s;ed the execution of it with &s;uch ob&s;tinacy,
that he had been at infinite pains in a&s;&s;erting his
own prerogative, by convincing her both from
<PB N="287" REF="295">
rea&s;on and example, that he was king and prie&s;t
in his own family, and that &s;he owed the mo&s;t
implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will: he likewi&s;e in|formed
the company, that he had lately &s;een his
friend Roderick, who had come from London on
purpo&s;e to vi&s;it him, after having gained his law|suit
with Mr. Topehall, who was obliged to pay
Narci&s;&s;a's fortune; that Mr. Random, in all ap|pearance,
led a very happy life in the conver&s;a|tion
of his father and bedfellow, by whom he
enjoyed a &s;on and daughter; and that Morgan
had received in a pre&s;ent from him, a piece of
very fine linnen of his wife's own making, &s;eve|ral
kits of &s;almon, and two ca&s;ks of pickled pork,
the mo&s;t delicate he had ever ta&s;ted; together
with a barrel of excellent herrings for &s;almagundy,
which he knew to be his favourite di&s;h.</P>
<P>This topick of conver&s;ation being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the
Italian was de&s;ired to exhibit a &s;pecimen of his
art, and in a few minutes conducted the company
into the next room, where to their great a&s;toni&s;h|ment
and affright, they beheld a thou&s;and &s;er|pents
winding along the cieling. Morgan &s;truck
with this phaenomenon, which he had not &s;een
before, began to utter exorci&s;ms with great devo|tion,
Mr. Jolter ran terrified out of the room,
Gauntlet drew his hanger, and Peregrine him&s;elf
was di&s;concerted. The operator perceiving their
confu&s;ion, de&s;ired them to retire, and calling
them back in an in&s;tant, there was not a viper to
be &s;een. He rai&s;ed their admiration by &s;undry
other performances, and the Welchman's former
opinion and abhorrence of his character began
to recur, when in con&s;ideration of the civility
with which he had been treated, this Italian im|parted
to them all the methods by which he had
acted &s;uch wonders, that were no other than the
<PB N="288" REF="296">
effects of natural cau&s;es curiou&s;ly combined; &s;o
that Morgan became a convert to his &s;kill, a&s;ked
pardon for the &s;u&s;picion he had entertained, and
invited the &s;tranger to pa&s;s a few days with him
at Canterbury. The &s;cruples of Godfrey and Jol|ter
were removed at the &s;ame time, and Pere|grine
te&s;tified his &s;atisfaction by an hand&s;ome gra|tuity
which he be&s;towed upon their entertainer.</P>
<P>The evening being &s;pent in this &s;ociable man|ner,
every man retired to his re&s;pective chamber,
and next morning they breakfa&s;ted together, when
Morgan declared he would &s;tay till he &s;hould &s;ee
our hero fairly embarked, that he might have the
plea&s;ure of Mr. Gauntlet's company to his own
habitation; mean while, by the &s;kipper's advice,
the &s;ervants were ordered to carry a &s;tore of wine
and provi&s;ion on board in ca&s;e of accident; and
as the packet-boat could not &s;ail before one
o'clock, the company walked up hill to vi&s;it the
ca&s;tle, where they &s;aw the &s;word of Julius Cae&s;ar
and Queen Elizabeth's pocket pi&s;tol, repeated
Shake&s;pear's de&s;cription, while they &s;urveyed the
chalky cliffs on each &s;ide, and ca&s;t their eyes to|wards
the city of Calais, that was ob&s;cured by a
thick cloud which did not much regale their eye|&s;ight,
becau&s;e it &s;eemed to portend foul weather.</P>
<P>Having viewed every thing remarkable in this
place, they returned to the pier, where after the
compliments of parting, and an affectionate em|brace
between the two young gentlemen, Pere|grine
and his governor &s;tept on board, the &s;ails
were hoi&s;ted, and they went to &s;ea with a fair
wind, while Godfrey, Morgan and the conjurer
walked back to the inn, from whence they &s;et
out for Canterbury before dinner.</P>
