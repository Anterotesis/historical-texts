<HEAD>JEFFERY, LORD AMHERST.</HEAD>
<P>JEFFERY, &s;ince Lord, Amher&s;t, is the &s;econd &s;on of the late Jef|fery Amher&s;t, E&s;q. a gentleman who, though bred to the law, inhe|rited from a very re&s;pectable ance&s;try, a freehold e&s;tate at Riverhead, near Seven Oaks, and who&s;e family is equally e&s;teemed from its de&s;|cent, and for the con&s;iderable &s;urrounding families, to which it is re|lated by matrimonial alliances. The elder brother of the pre&s;ent lord dying unmarried, the e&s;tate of cour&s;e de&s;cended to him. But Mr. Amher&s;t was born to give lu&s;tre to his family, not to receive it from paternal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. With that juvenile enthu&s;ia&s;m with which great minds are frequently attached to particular pur&s;uits, and without which no one ever became illu&s;trious in any, he at a very early period made choice of the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, and in a happy hour was received into the &s;ervice of his country. Having pa&s;&s;ed through the inferior gradations with honour to him&s;elf, and to tho&s;e who promoted him, and having di&s;played, in &s;ome re&s;pects, tho&s;e early promi&s;es of military talents, which afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed him on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic, he at length obtained the command of a regiment. After this a war breaking out between France and England, of which North America was the principal theatre, his lord&s;hip was appointed to &s;erve in that country, where he &s;oon had opportunities of di&s;playing his talents as a general officer. The courage and military abilities which entitled him to the tru&s;t thus repo&s;ed in him, were not long unatte&s;ted by the fears of his enemies, and the acclamations of his country. It is not the intention of the pre&s;ent article to enumerate all the victories of this brave and fortunate &s;oldier: the following, among
<PB N="2" REF="3">
the mo&s;t important, are &s;ufficient to evince the value of the com|mander, and to in&s;ure the gratitude of his country. In the &s;ummer of 1758, he undertook the expedition again&s;t Loui&s;bourg; which, together with the i&s;land of Cape Breton, on which it is &s;ituated, in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, &s;urrendered with all its dependencies to his victorious arms on July 26th, 1758. This important conque&s;t not only deprived the enemy of an important place of &s;trength, on which the pro&s;perity of their mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America depended, as it was the guardian and protector of their trade in that part of the world, but it al&s;o put Great Britain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the navigation of the river Saint Lawrence, cut off France from the advantages of her fi&s;hery, and thereby con&s;iderably di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her We&s;t India I&s;lands, and finally opened the road for the reduction of Canada. The &s;ame campaign was di&s;tingui&s;hed by another very important atchievement: for in the month of November following, a plan being laid by this vi|gilant general for the capture of fort Du Que&s;ney, one of the keys of Canada, &s;ituated on the Lakes; and the execution being intru&s;ted to brigadier general Forbes, the a&s;&s;ault proved &s;ucce&s;sful, and the for|tre&s;s was accordingly captured: mea&s;ures being conducted at the &s;ame time with &s;o much &s;pirit and wi&s;dom, that the Indians were &s;o far detached from the alliance of the enemy, as to give no ob&s;truction to the expedition. In the en&s;uing campaign another &s;trong &s;tation was reduced, under the prudent au&s;pices of this a&s;&s;iduous officer. Sir William John&s;on, to whom the command of the expedition again&s;t Niagara devolved, in con&s;equence of the accidental death of brig|gen. Prideaux, on the 24th July, 1759, having defeated and taken M. d'Aubrey near that place, the fort &s;urrendered the next day. This important victory and capture, threw the whole of the Indian fur trade into the hands of the Engli&s;h; and al&s;o &s;ecured the Briti&s;h do|minions behind it from the incur&s;ions of the &s;calping parties, and, in &s;hort, from all ho&s;tile annoyance.</P>
<P>Some time before this, general Abercrombie had made an un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attempt on Ticonderoga, in which, together with a con&s;iderable number of men, the Briti&s;h army had been robbed of tho&s;e gallant and re&s;pected young officers, Lord Howe, and colonel Roger Town|&s;hend. But it now, on the 26th of July, 1759, the day after the reduction of Niagara, confe&s;&s;ed the power and fortune of the Briti&s;h arms, and &s;urrendered its important fortre&s;s. Thus was the way cleared for the &s;ubjection of Canada; and accordingly we find, tha$ on the 14th of the following month, the long and ob&s;tinately di&s;pute$ po&s;t of Crown Point &s;urrendered to the Briti&s;h forces; the 18th o$ the en&s;uing September beheld the chief &s;ettlement of the enemy in thi$

part of the globe, the ever to be remembered Quebec, &s;urrender upon capitulation to our commanders; and in the month of Augu&s;t, 1760, the French army evacuating I&s;le au Noix, abandoning the I&s;le Gal|lot, and Picquet's I&s;land, at the approach of general Amher&s;t, I&s;le Royale being captured by him, and Montreal, the la&s;t remaining po&s;t of the foe, &s;urrendering on the 8th of September following, the whole province became &s;ubject to the Briti&s;h government. In the mean time the I&s;land of Newfoundland having been reduced by the French, general Amher&s;t projected an expedition for its recovery. The com|mand of this was intru&s;ted to the late major general William Amher&s;t (then lieutenant colonel) who giving effect and action to the plan which his brother had formed, happily re&s;tored the i&s;land to its Briti&s;h owners, and captured the various garri&s;ons which had been &s;tationed by the enemy in the re&s;pective po&s;ts. General Amher&s;t now &s;eeing that the whole continent of North America was reduced in &s;ubjection to his country, returned to New York, the capital of the Briti&s;h em|pire there, to receive all tho&s;e honours which a grateful people can &s;hower on the vindicators of their rights and glory. His arrival was celebrated by public rejoicings, and every te&s;timony of popu|lar applau&s;e; and the corporation pre&s;ented him with a gold box, containing the freedom of that city: a gift rendered the more gracious by the animated and elegant addre&s;s of the mayor, in which he enumerated &s;ome of the principal &s;ervices which the ge|neral had performed for his country, and expatiated on the grateful &s;en&s;e of his worth which his conduct had in&s;pired in the bo&s;oms of all. Nor was the Engli&s;h government entirely unmindful of his me|rits and his &s;ervices. The thanks of the hou&s;e of commons had al|ready been tran&s;mitted to him; and among other honourable te&s;timo|nies of approbation, in 1761, he was created one of the knights companions of the mo&s;t honourable order of the Bath. He had al&s;o &s;ome time before been appointed commander in chief of all the forces in America, and governor general of the Briti&s;h provinces there. But &s;hortly after the peace was concluded, he re&s;igned his command, and returned to England, arriving in London in December, 1763. The commander who&s;e exploits have added lu&s;tre to his name, and aggran|dized the power of his country, and who has neither embroiled him|&s;elf with party di&s;putes, nor &s;tooped to be the tool of a faction, can never fail of a gracious reception from an amiable &s;overeign to whom he has devoted his talents and his labours. His maje&s;ty accordingly received his conquering general, like one who&s;e &s;ervices demanded &s;omething beyond the u&s;ual formula of gracious approbation; and the government of the province of Virginia was conferred on him, as the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
fir&s;t mark of that royal favour which he had merited and obtained. In the year 1768, he was appointed colonel of the 3d regiment of foot, with permi&s;&s;ion to continue al&s;o his command of the 60th, or royal American regiment, of four battalions; and in October, 1770, he was appointed governor of the i&s;land of Guern&s;ey, and the ca&s;tle of Cornet, together with all other i&s;lands, forts, and dependencies thereunto belonging. To the&s;e was added the office of lieutenant general of the ordnance, in October 1772; at which time he was &s;worn of the privy council. From this period al&s;o to the beginning of the year 1782, he officiated as commander in chief of the Engli&s;h forces, though he was not promoted to the rank of general in the army till March, 1778; from which period, to the time of his re&s;ig|nation in March, 1782, he acted as elde&s;t general on the &s;taff of Eng|land. Till his military promotion in 1778, he had no higher appoint|ment in the army than that of elde&s;t lieutenant general on the Engli&s;h &s;taff. In the year 1780, he re&s;igned the command of the 3d regi|ment of foot, and was promoted to the 2d troop of hor&s;e-grenadiers. Be&s;ides the military honours already mentioned, general Amher&s;t received from his royal ma&s;ter on the 20th of May, 1776, the dignity of Briti&s;h peerage, by the title of Baron Amher&s;t, of Holme&s;dale, in the county of Kent. Nor was he, who in former times had been the ornament and glory of Britain in a di&s;tant climate, and a dangerous camp, doomed to re&s;t at home without power or opportunity of doing e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to his country. It is not intended here to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed how far the admini&s;tration of that time were blameable for not cau&s;ing effective means to be u&s;ed more early for checking the riots in June, 1780, when a de&s;perate band of robbers, under the &s;tale pretence of religion, committed the mo&s;t daring and &s;hocking depredations on the peace and &s;ecurity of a metropolis filled with troops of di&s;ciplined &s;oldiers, and boa&s;ting of a regular police. But the honour of &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing, with little blood&s;hed, this outrageous mob of dep$edators, who had already began to lay the inhabitants of the metropolis under contribution, had de&s;troyed the public gaols, relea&s;ed and recruited them&s;elves with the pri&s;oners, and were preparing to plunder the Bank, is to be attributed to the prudent conduct of Lord Amher&s;t. It was he who, according to the duty of his office, planned and cau&s;ed to be executed tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which checked the progre&s;s of anarchy and deva&s;tation, and re&s;tored tranquillity to the metropolis, though not before it began to dread all the evils which the lowe&s;t and vile&s;t of mankind can inflict, on tho&s;e whom inferiority of circum&s;tances had taught them to envy and to hate, and whom &s;uperiority of power would &s;oon have enabled them to per&s;ecute with cruelty and contempt.
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Had this loo&s;e and di&s;&s;olute mob been guided by a re&s;olution which kept pace with their outrageous profligacy, there is no knowing where the evil might have ended. Had they, while in the height of their career, after de&s;troying the pri&s;on of Newgate, proceeded im|mediately to the Bank, they would have found that place unprepared for their reception; and plunder, unbridled licenciou&s;ne&s;s, popular anarchy, and public ruin, mu&s;t have been the inevitable con&s;equences. But Providence, who&s;e general di&s;pen&s;ations are calculated for the general good, has denied to the profligate and the ba&s;e that vigour of mind which can plan and execute great undertakings, and that quickne&s;s of perception which can &s;eize the proffered advantages of the moment. Either this gang of de&s;peradoes had not courage im|mediately to attempt &s;o daring a piece of mi&s;chief; or el&s;e perhaps they had never ventured to meditate &s;o great a project, till emboldened by an uninterrupted career of &s;ucce&s;s. Be this as it will, the attempt was not made till the &s;ucceeding day. In the mean while the de&s;ign got wind, and tho&s;e who, from idle curio&s;ity, had &s;welled the formid|able appearance of the in&s;urgents, and others who, from mere wan|tonne&s;s, had but too far countenanced their depredations, began to reflect on the dangers and the con&s;equences of their conduct, with|drew them&s;elves to the &s;ecurity of their homes, and left the de&s;peradoes to their fate. Government in the mean while was alarmed. His lord&s;hip ordered out the military, the Bank was garri&s;oned, and the money &s;o concealed and &s;ecured, that had the a&s;&s;ault been &s;ucce&s;sful, the banditti would have been di&s;appointed of their booty. But vigo|rous mea&s;ures were now determined upon; and it was &s;oon evident how little is to be effected by a tumultuous rabble again&s;t a handful of regular troops. Though every precaution had been made u&s;e of in other places to prevent blood&s;hed, and though but few compara|tively fell in other parts of the town, yet here it was nece&s;&s;ary to pro|ceed with a &s;everity in &s;ome degree proportionate to the de&s;perate eagerne&s;s of the rabble; and to &s;trike with terror tho&s;e who could not be &s;ubdued by lenity. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that con&s;iderably above a hun|dred of the mo&s;t daring fell at this place; the officers di&s;patching tho&s;e who had been only wounded by the privates, to convince the de&s;perate that no mercy was to be hoped if they per&s;evered in their profligate de&s;ign. The unhappy victims were prudently interred behind the Bank, that the minds of the people might not be agitated by a &s;ight which always excites commotion in a mercantile city&mdash; the bodies of men &s;laughtered within their walls by the hand of mar|tial law. Thus terminated this dangerous tumult, with as little blood|&s;hed as prudence would permit, and with le&s;s than could po&s;&s;ibly

have been expected. The humanity which marked the regulations and in&s;tructions of his lord&s;hip in this affair may be termed the happy and honourable conclu&s;ion of that career of glory which his country will ever reflect upon with a mixture of hone&s;t pride and gratitude. After this nothing particular marked his official conduct; and indeed he did not long after remain in his elevated &s;ituation. During the early part of his lord&s;hip's life his conduct does not &s;eem to have been marked by attachments to any particular party; the duties of his mi|litary &s;ituation, and the advancement of the intere&s;ts and glory of his country engro&s;&s;ing all his thoughts. But when re&s;iding in the vicinity of the court, his lord&s;hip experienced the truth of the axiom, "that in England every man mu&s;t choo&s;e his party." He naturally became attached to that mini&s;try with which he was a&s;&s;ociated, and under who&s;e influence he had obtained tho&s;e honours which were the ju&s;t rewards of pa&s;t &s;ervices. On this account therefore, when the mini&s;try of Lord North found their po&s;ts no longer tenable again&s;t the growing force of oppo&s;ition, Lord Amher&s;t remained no longer in his &s;i|tuation. In March 1782, he re&s;igned his &s;taff as commander in chief of the forces, which was &s;hortly after conferred upon general Conway. Since this period, his lord&s;hip has lived retired from all public bu&s;ine&s;s, mingling but little in political debate: deeming per|haps that a youth &s;pent in the glorious camp of danger, can reap little addition of honour from an age devoted to party &s;quabbles, and con|tentions for po&s;ts of ambition or emolument. Con&s;idering his lord|&s;hip in a &s;tate of popular demi&s;e at pre&s;ent, it is pre&s;umed that it may not be improper to take a liberty with the memory of his former con|duct, which can &s;eldom be done with ju&s;tice and impartiality while a man is yet engaged in the bu&s;y &s;cenes of action. The character of his lord&s;hip ought to occupy &s;ome part of the con&s;ideration of one who profe&s;&s;es to write even a &s;ketch of his important life. This may in part be drawn from what has already been recorded: but it &s;hall be more particularly &s;tated. His vigilance and courage are too &s;trongly marked in every part of his conduct in America to need further com|ment; and his di&s;patches &s;peak a mind attentive to the duties of an offi|cial &s;ituation, and tinged with &s;omething of the Spartan &s;pirit, more engro&s;&s;ed in the projection and execution of great and hazardous enter|prizes, than careful about the eloquent illu&s;tration of his exploits. But the mo&s;t prominent features in his lord&s;hip's character were the fertility of his mind in the invention of expedients, with which he &s;urmounted difficulties apparently inacce&s;&s;ible, and the &s;trict and rigid &s;everity with which he pre&s;erved di&s;cipline in his army. Of the former of the&s;e a &s;triking in&s;tance was given in the dangerous but &s;ucce&s;sful at|tack
<PB N="7" REF="8">
at I&s;le Royale. To di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the foe from their &s;tations was not po&s;&s;ible without an attack upon their fort by water. This appeared impracticable by means of the rocks, of the rapidity of the torrent, and of the falls, which could not fail to &s;plit or over&s;et the boats made u&s;e of on &s;uch occa&s;ions. But the di&s;lodgement of the enemy from this po&s;t appeared of the utmo&s;t importance; little el&s;e being left to do to bring affairs to an expeditious and happy i&s;&s;ue. His lord&s;hip there|fore had a number of round boats built, &s;o con&s;tructed as to &s;ail equally well whichever &s;ide might be forced forward by the brakes of the waves, and prevent their being whirled away by the eddies of the flood, da&s;hed again&s;t the crags, or over&s;et by the rapidity of the falls. On board of the&s;e he embarked, &s;haring in common with his troops the dangers of the expedition; and falling down the Lakes with the current, he effected the purpo&s;e of his undertaking. The other leading feature in the general's character, however it may per|haps be ju&s;tified by the con&s;ideration of military nece&s;&s;ity, will not place him in &s;o amiable a light in the eyes of the children of &s;en&s;ibi|lity; and the circum&s;tance now about to be related will undoubtedly draw forth the pitying &s;igh from tho&s;e who can excu&s;e the aberrations which proceed from the glow of youthful pa&s;&s;ion. A young fellow, of gay and heroic di&s;po&s;ition, but of rather wild and irregular conduct, though the &s;on of a con&s;iderable trade&s;man in London, felt him&s;elf impelled, either by that martial ardour natural to his warmth of tem|per, or by that wandering and un&s;ettled inclination frequently attend|ant on youthful di&s;&s;ipation, to enter into the &s;ervice of his country: and he went to America accordingly in the capacity of a common &s;oldier. But as, together with a very fine per&s;on, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome accom|pli&s;hments above the expectations of his &s;tation; and as, by means of an income which his father allowed him, he was enabled to pre&s;erve a gentility of appearance which di&s;tingui&s;hed him above his comrades, the youth always attracted and pre&s;erved to him&s;elf a degree of re&s;pect to which his &s;ituation in the ranks did not &s;eem to entitle him. The regiment in which he &s;erved was, during the war, quartered in the town of Albany. Here the youth, who&s;e heart had at all times been devoted to gallantry, &s;oon became tenderly attached to a beautiful young lady, the daughter of one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable inhabitants of the town. The lady returned his attachment with a di&s;intere&s;ted ardour which gratified his warme&s;t wi&s;hes. But how often does the pro&s;perous gale which &s;eems to be wafting us to the harbour of felicity, by &s;ome &s;udden gu&s;t, &s;hipwreck us on the cliffs of ruin, even in &s;ight of the wi&s;hed-for &s;hore! The relations of the young lady were in|formed of the connection, and removed her &s;uddenly to another part of the country. The young &s;oldier got intimation of the&s;e proceed|ings,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
and without the delay of obtaining leave of ab&s;ence, &s;et off in pur&s;uit of his mi&s;tre&s;s; di&s;covered the place of her retreat, and having adju&s;ted the terms of their future corre&s;pondence, was returning to his quarters. But the unfortunate lover was &s;eized before he reached the lines, and tried by a court-martial for de&s;ertion. The officers, with pitying hearts, pa&s;&s;ed unwillingly the &s;entence of military law upon his crime; and immediately &s;ent an account of the affair to ge|neral Amher&s;t, then at New York, accompanying it with a petition for his pardon, &s;igned by every officer of the three regiments then at Albany. But the &s;evere temper of the general admitted of no relaxa|tion in the &s;trict laws of di&s;cipline. He is &s;aid to have an&s;wered to the &s;olicitations made for the life of the unfortunate victim, that <HI>The laws of war condemned the de&s;erter to death, and if he were his own brother he mu&s;t abide by the deci&s;ion</HI>. The youth had been permitted during the time of &s;u&s;pen&s;e to be at large, accompanied only by one &s;entinel; but the fatal me&s;&s;enger arrived with the warrant for his execution, and he was led to death among the tears of &s;urrounding &s;pectators. The officers, though they could not &s;ave his life, decreed him all the ho|nours which could attend upon his exit. He was led to the fatal &s;pot, accompanied by a long military proce&s;&s;ion, which la&s;ted for the &s;pace of two hours, filling the pitying beholders with awe, but not melting the gallant &s;pirit of the victim. He walked round all the ranks, ex|patiated on the ju&s;tice of his &s;entence, exhorted his comrades to be warned by his example, and met his death with a calmne&s;s and heroi&s;m which proved him worthy of a better fate. The reader it is pre&s;umed will readily pardon the detail of a circum&s;tance which, how|ever romantic in appearance, has been well atte&s;ted to the writer of this article by a gentleman of indubitable integrity, and who was an eye witne&s;s of the whole. Its in&s;ertion al&s;o appeared proper, as it places in a &s;trong point of view the character of this able commander and rigid di&s;ciplinarian.</P>
<P>Lord Amher&s;t has no legitimate i&s;&s;ue, although he has been twice married; fir&s;t to a lady of Hampton, the daughter of Thomas Daly|&s;on, E&s;q. which lady dying in 1765, his lord&s;hip, in 1767, united him|&s;elf to Mi&s;s Elizabeth Cary, daughter of the lieutenant-general of that name, and niece to Lord Vi&s;count Falkland. His lord&s;hip, who is now about &s;eventy-three, although he has the appearance of more ad|vanced age, enjoys, con&s;idering his years, a firm and happy con&s;titution. He is tall and thin; but his figure, which is now venerable with the marks of age, and the hard&s;hips of former &s;ervices, was formerly martial and commanding, full of dignity, and expre&s;&s;ive of great powers of mind; and of that enterpri&s;ing boldne&s;s, and that &s;teady re&s;olution, the former of which di&s;tingui&s;hed him as an officer, the latter as a commander.</P>

<P>Mr. Howard was de&s;cended from a colateral branch of the hou&s;e of Norfolk, and was born at Cordington in Bedford&s;hire, where he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed by inheritance a freehold e&s;tate, &s;mall indeed in compari&s;on with the ample genero&s;ity of his &s;oul, but &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to have &s;ecured re&s;pect, even if his di&s;tingui&s;hed virtues had not called forth a &s;entiment more warm and more honourable. Indeed, when we con&s;ider with how &s;mall an income this amiable philanthropi&s;t has di&s;pen&s;ed more benefits to mankind than the power and affluence of princes ever be|$towed, we are taught to excu&s;e our&s;elves no longer for the little good we do towards &s;ociety, on account of the want of affluence, or the
<PB N="10" REF="11">
frowns of fortune; and are in&s;tructed how con&s;iderable a proportion of the happine&s;s imparted by charity depends upon the benevolence of the heart, and the indu&s;try and attention with which that benevolence is carried into action. He &s;pent his earlie&s;t years abroad, not returning into England till his coming of age called him to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate. Shortly after this, having taken lodgings at the hou&s;e of a gentlewo|man of decayed fortune, he was &s;eized with a violent fever, of which he langui&s;hed for a con&s;iderable time. The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e watched and attended him during his illne&s;s, with a tender a&s;&s;iduity to which he chiefly attributed his recovery. The grateful heart of Mr. Howard knew not how to render a return equal to the obligation, without making his careful ho&s;te&s;s the mi&s;tre&s;s of his fortune. And as gratitude, in tender and be|nevolent minds is clo&s;ely allied to love, he &s;eems to have made his propo&s;al in terms which &s;hew all the ardour of that pa&s;&s;ion, telling her, that if &s;he did not con&s;ent to marry him, he &s;hould immediately quit his friends and his country, never to &s;ee them more. The lady, who was upwards of forty, remon&s;trated on the difference of their ages; but he replied, that he could by no other means make a proper return for her kindne&s;s, and having given her twenty-four hours to con&s;ider of his propo&s;al, &s;he con&s;ented. For a con&s;iderable time they enjoyed a degree of happine&s;s which &s;y&s;tem-builders would have con&s;idered as in|con&s;i&s;tent with the di&s;&s;imilarity of their years. This happine&s;s was only terminated by the death of Mrs. Howard; and (though, as will be &s;een hereafter, Mr. Howard again entered into the matrimonial &s;tate) her ear|ly lo&s;s was lamented by him with the &s;incere&s;t tenderne&s;s He erected a monument to her memory in Whitechapel church, and has often been heard to &s;ay, that to her excellent example he owed much of his de&s;ire to be &s;er|viceable to his fellow-creatures. To another adventitious circum&s;tance Mr. Howard, perhaps with ju&s;tice, a&s;cribes the particular direction towards which his active benevolence was &s;o uniformly bia&s;&s;ed: though certain|ly a mind like his could never have been inert in a community where &s;orrow was to be found dropping the dejected tear, or where pain and angui&s;h were heard to breathe their affecting moan. But as we are now entering upon the con&s;ideration of his public conduct, we think proper to ob&s;erve, that for the &s;ake of connection we &s;hall throw &s;uch parts of the life of this great man as relate to his public character, into one regular narrative, re&s;erving &s;uch particulars as relate to his private life for the &s;econd part of the&s;e memoirs.</P>
<P>In the year 1756, being de&s;irous of making the tour of Portugal, he embarked a pa&s;&s;enger on board the Hanover, Li&s;bon packet, for that purpo&s;e. But as, at that time, this country and France were in a &s;tate of ho&s;tilities, the ve&s;&s;el was captured by a French privateer, and taken into Bre&s;t. On this occa&s;ion Mr. Howard was not only a witne&s;s to
<PB N="11" REF="12">
tho&s;e hard&s;hips to which pri&s;oners are frequently expo&s;ed, but he was al&s;o a &s;harer in all their &s;ufferings. "Before I reached Bre&s;t," &s;ays he, "I &s;uffered the extremity of thir&s;t, not having for above forty hours one drop of water, nor hardly a mor&s;el of food. In the ca&s;tle of Bre&s;t I lay &s;ix nights upon &s;traw; and ob&s;erving how cruelly my countrymen were u&s;ed there, and at Morlaix, whither I was carried next; during the two months I was at Corhaix upon parole, I corre&s;ponded with the Engli&s;h pri&s;oners at Bre&s;t, Morlaix, and Dinnan. I had &s;ufficient evi|dence of their being treated with &s;uch barbarity, that many hundreds had peri&s;hed; and that thirty-&s;ix were buried in a hole at Dinnan in one day. Perhaps what I &s;uffered on this occa&s;ion increa&s;ed my &s;ym|pathy with the unhappy people, who&s;e ca&s;e is the &s;ubject of this book." <HI>Howard on Pri&s;ons</HI>, &s;. 1. When Mr. Howard afterward came to Eng|land, &s;till on his parole, he communicated tho&s;e particulars, with which his &s;ufferings or his ob&s;ervation had &s;upplied him, upon this &s;ubject to the commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;ick and wounded pri&s;oners. The information was received with the attention due to the authenticity and the humanity with which it was given: the commi&s;&s;ioners returned their thanks to the informant, cau&s;ed a remon&s;trance to be made to the French court, and thus procured redre&s;s for the captives: tho&s;e at Bre&s;t, Morlaix, and Dinnan, being brought home in the fir&s;t cartel-&s;hips. Nor did Mr. Howard &s;atisfy him&s;elf with merely redre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e mi&s;eries of which he had been partly an involuntary &s;pectator; the circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s &s;unk deep into his mind, and made &s;o indelible an impre&s;&s;ion, as to in|fluence his conduct through every future &s;tage of his life. He &s;oon found that France was not the only country in which there was cau&s;e for like complaints, and that pri&s;oners of war were not the only &s;ufferers by the loath&s;ome inconveniences which give additional horrors to the lo&s;s of liberty. In England&mdash;in his own county, he found that the debtor and the felon were equal &s;harers in the di&s;ea&s;es and di&s;tre&s;&s;es incident to confinement, un&s;oftened by humanity and unalleviated by any of tho&s;e attentions by which health might be pre&s;erved. And though he plainly &s;aw the inju&s;tice of cla&s;&s;ing both the&s;e de&s;criptions of unhappy beings to|gether under the &s;ame general puni&s;hment, yet his &s;trong benevolence would not admit that even guilt ought to &s;uffer beyond what ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity demands. "I grant," &s;ays he, after &s;peaking of pri&s;oners of war, "there is a material difference in the <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> of foreign and dome&s;tic pri&s;oners, but there is none in their <HI>nature</HI>. Debtors and felons, as well as ho&s;tile foreigners, are <HI>men</HI>, and by men they ought to be treated as men. Tho&s;e gentlemen who, when they are told of the mi&s;ery which our pri&s;oners &s;uffer, content them&s;elves with &s;aying, <HI>Let them take care and keep out</HI>, prefaced perhaps with an angry prayer, &s;eem not duly &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="12" REF="13">
of the favour of Providence, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the &s;ufferers; they do not remember that we are required to imitate our gracious hea|venly parent, <HI>who is kind to the unthankful and the evil:</HI> they al&s;o forget the vici&s;&s;itudes of human affairs, the unexpected changes to which all men are liable: and that tho&s;e who&s;e circum&s;tances are affluent, may in time be reduced to indigence, and them&s;elves become debtors and pri&s;oners. And as to criminality, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, that a man who has often &s;hud|dered at hearing the account of a murder, may on a &s;udden temptation commit that very crime. <HI>Let him that thinks he &s;tands, take heed left he fall</HI>, and commi&s;erate tho&s;e that are fallen." The better to be ena|bled to examine into tho&s;e evils, of which there was &s;o much cau&s;e to complain, and to impower him&s;elf to redre&s;s them as far as the &s;phere of his ability could be extended, in the year 1773 he took upon him|&s;elf the office of &s;heriff for the county of Bedford, although the circum|&s;tance of his being a di&s;&s;enter would have excu&s;ed him from &s;o trouble|&s;ome a &s;ituation. On this account there were &s;ome few &s;cruples in the bo&s;om of Mr. Howard, relative to the &s;afety with which he might di&s;|charge the office, and the danger of incurring the penalties of non|conformity. But having con&s;ulted &s;ome friends of eminence in the law, he did not find &s;o much rea&s;on to dread that the act would be enforced, as was &s;ufficient to deter him from his benevolent de&s;igns. This is not the only in&s;tance in which Mr. Howard has expo&s;ed his fortune to in|jury, and endeavoured (though always aver&s;e to popularity) to bring him&s;elf forward into public life, for the &s;ake of advancing tho&s;e great objects of humanity which were the grand pur&s;uits of his life. He en|deavoured to &s;ecure a &s;eat in parliament for the borough of Bedford that he might be the better enabled to effect a national reforma|tion of our pri&s;ons, ho&s;pitals, &amp;c. It will hardly be credited in a fu|ture period, that this object which &s;hould have made all mankind an|xious for the &s;ecurity of his election, was the very circum&s;tance which rendered his de&s;ign abortive. There were per&s;ons who&s;e prejudices, or who&s;e want of feeling, rendered them de&s;irous of di&s;appointing his li|beral de&s;igns, Mr. and Whitbread was brought to parliament in oppo&s;i|tion to the intere&s;t of this great philanthropi&s;t.</P>
<P>But to return: during his &s;heriffalty he made a particular and anxious &s;crutiny into the &s;tate of pri&s;ons in the county of Bedford, and al&s;o occa&s;ioned very con&s;iderable reformations of the various abu&s;es which he di&s;covered. In the&s;e and his future vi&s;its to the various loath&s;ome dungeons which vindictive ju&s;tice has invented, and which negligence and inhumanity have contributed to render noxious and abhorrent, his only precautions to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from infection were, never to enter an ho&s;pital or pri&s;on before breakfa&s;t, and in an offen&s;ive room never to
<PB N="13" REF="14">
draw his breath deeply, to &s;mell at vinegar while he was in tho&s;e places, and to change his apparel afterwards, the la&s;t two of which precautions, after habit had rendered him le&s;s timid, he entirely omitted. When he was interrogated how he could venture to expo&s;e him&s;elf to &s;uch dan|gers, it was his u&s;ual an&s;wer, "That next to the free goodne&s;s and mercy of the author of his being, temperance and cleanline&s;s were his pre&s;ervatives; and that tru&s;ting in <HI>divine providence</HI>, and believing him|&s;elf in the way of his duty, he vi&s;ited the noxious cells; and while thus employed <HI>he feared no evil</HI>." While we admire the genuine piety which dictated this &s;entiment, &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals cannot but lament that &s;uch are the in&s;crutible ways of providence, that humanity and con&s;cious rectitude could not at all times pre&s;erve the philanthropi&s;t from the fatal influence of tainted vapours; but that after having avoided all in|fections till in the year 1783, at his la&s;t vi&s;it to the <HI>Tour de St. Pierre</HI> at Li&s;le, he &s;hould not only then have caught the fever there, but &s;hould at a future period have imbibed a fatal di&s;temper which has finally deprived human nature of its noble&s;t ornament, and &s;ociety of its true&s;t friend. The object which mo&s;t affected the mind of the philanthropi&s;t in &s;urveying the Engli&s;h pri&s;ons, was the cruel practice of detaining pri&s;oners after acquittal for their fees, and other oppre&s;&s;ive demands of a &s;imilar nature. To remedy this, he applied to the ju&s;tices to a&s;&s;ign to the gaoler and others certain &s;alaries in lieu of fees; but as no precedent for this could be recollected, Mr. Howard, unwilling his de&s;ign &s;hould be prevented by &s;uch an excu&s;e, vi&s;ited the neighbouring counties in que&s;t of one: but he only found additional &s;cenes of horror and di&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e exertions &s;oon attracted the notice of the nation, and in March, 1774, he was examined in the Hou&s;e of Commons upon the &s;ubject. Happily Mr. Howard was endowed with great fluency of &s;peech; and as this circum&s;tance enabled him to communicate his ob&s;ervations with ca&s;e and &s;ucce&s;s, the information he afforded, and the humanity with which he had collected, and with which he now illu&s;trated his remarks, drew upon him the thanks of the Hou&s;e; and, which to his heart afforded far &s;uperior &s;atisfaction, was productive of &s;erious regard to the &s;ituation of the unhappy pri&s;oners; for &s;oon after, Mr. Popham, member for Taunton, repeated the humane attempt which had mi&s;carried a few years before, and brought in a bill for the relief of pri&s;oners who &s;hould be acquitted&mdash;re&s;pecting their fees; and another bill for pre&s;erving the health of pri&s;oners, and preventing the gaol-di&s;temper; both of which pa&s;&s;ed that &s;e&s;&s;ions. But as acts of parliament are u&s;ually printed in black letter, which many (e&s;pecially in country places) cannot read, Mr. Howard, aware of how much importance it was that the humane decrees of the &s;enate &s;hould be properly di&s;&s;eminated, had the&s;e two bills
<PB N="14" REF="15">
printed in the Roman character, at his own expence, and &s;ent them to the keeper of every county gaol in England. "By the&s;e acts," &s;ays the philanthropi&s;t, "the tear was wiped from many an eye; and the legi&s;lature had for them <HI>the ble&s;&s;ings of them that were ready to peri&s;h</HI>." The abu&s;es, the mi&s;eries, and the extortions which he di&s;covered in the gaols within his own and neighbouring counties prompted him to exa|mine tho&s;e in other parts of the kingdom; and in the years 1773, 74 and 75, he travelled all over England, Ireland, and Scotland, and vi&s;ited all the pri&s;ons in each, examining with that anxious curio&s;ity which de&s;ire to benefit the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of his fellow-creatures had in&s;pired, into every abu&s;e, and carefully noting down every circum&s;tance which re|quired redre&s;s, or which, on the contrary, might appear worthy of imi|tation. In one of the&s;e vi&s;its to Hor&s;ham gaol with the keeper, he &s;aw a heap of &s;tones and rubbi&s;h lying in &s;uch a manner as to excite &s;u&s;picion; and upon examination found that the felons had been undermining the cells. They had been at work two or three days, and that very night was fix|ed upon for a general e&s;cape. So far had they proceeded in their plan, that had they been re&s;olute or abandoned enough when they found they were di&s;covered, to have murdered their detectors, nothing could have prevented their ru&s;hing out and making their e&s;cape. But perhaps, &s;ince there is no condition of humanity &s;o deba&s;ed or abandoned as to be entirely dead to the impre&s;&s;ive &s;entiment of gratitude, the eye of him who had braved for their &s;akes the dangers of the loath&s;ome cell, might overawe tho&s;e who were equal to the perpetration of any crime but that which would have &s;hortened the life of Howard.</P>
<P>Our traveller frequently found that the gaolers, con&s;cious of negli|gence and improper conduct, endeavoured, by artifice, to prevent him from pro&s;ecuting his inquiry. For this purpo&s;e they would pretend the utmo&s;t willingne&s;s to accompany him, but at the &s;ame time hint a fear of danger from <HI>the fever</HI> among the pri&s;oners. But Howard was not to be thus intimidated; he always proceeded, and generally found that the di&s;covery of the filthy and neglected &s;tate of the pri&s;on was, in fact, the object of their apprehen&s;ions. Frequently however the cells and ha|bitations thus inve&s;tigated, were &s;ufficiently offen&s;ive to have deterred any one from entering who was not &s;timulated by the noble motive of philanthropic &s;ympathy; and Mr. Howard him&s;elf found that after &s;uch vi&s;its his cloaths &s;o far imbibed the noxious effluvia, that he was unable to endure a po&s;t-chai&s;e, unle&s;s all the windows were down. This circum&s;tance compelled him to travel at all hours, and in all wea|thers, on hor&s;eback, expo&s;ed to all the dangers of the road, which how|ever he did without mole&s;tation, never experiencing any of tho&s;e inter|ruptions or di&s;a&s;ters, of which the rumours are &s;o innumerable.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">With how con&s;tant and re&s;tle&s;s an a&s;&s;iduity he pro&s;ecuted his inquiries, &mdash;and how completely his life was devoted to this object, may be ga|thered from the extent of his travels, and the number of his remarks&punc; and we find him, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame month (January 1775) re|lieving the angui&s;h of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed pri&s;oners in Ireland, and reforming the abu&s;es which had crept into the gaols in Scotland. It was in this month, that in the latter of the&s;e countries, the magi&s;trates of Gla&s;gow, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful and ho&s;pitable manner pre&s;ented him the freedom of their city, as a te&s;timony of that admiration which his conduct had excited. The &s;ame honour was conferred upon him on a future and &s;imilar occa&s;ion by the city of Edinburgh, as al&s;o by that of Liver|pool, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Having thus made him&s;elf thoroughly acquainted with the &s;tate of pri&s;ons in England, in Scotland, and Ireland, he returned to England in the &s;pring of the year 1775, with the de&s;ign of publi&s;hing his account of them, that thus the public might be &s;timulated to redre&s;s tho&s;e grie|vances, which his private exertions could not remove. But conjectur|ing that &s;ome u&s;eful information on this &s;ubject might be collected abroad, and willing to extend the advantages of his labours to foreign countries, he laid a&s;ide his papers, and travelled into France, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. The benefits he had thus an opportunity of di&s;pen&s;ing to mankind, induced him to repeat his journey in the year 1776, adding Switzerland to the countries which had before challenged his ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>At the Hague, the friendly interference of Sir Jo&s;eph Yorke, by pro|curing to the philanthropi&s;t every a&s;&s;i&s;tance which could facilitate the in|quiry in which he was engaged, reflected con&s;iderable honour on that re&s;pected amba&s;&s;ador. Nor in Germany were there wanting tho&s;e who were eager to &s;hare the honour of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the philanthropic de&s;igns of this illu&s;trious citizen of the world. The &s;ame year the friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s of the &s;enator <HI>Voght</HI>, at Hamburgh, procured him every ad|vantage of introduction and information, in vi&s;iting the various pri&s;ons in that great and opulent city. Mr. Howard did not in the&s;e, or indeed in any other of his travels, confine his ob&s;ervations to pri&s;ons only; the ho&s;pitals and charitable in&s;titutions of various denominations, were al&s;o the objects of his care: in &s;hort, to do good to the mi&s;erable and friend|le&s;s part of his fellow-creatures, was a de&s;ire interwoven with his very exi&s;tence, and he only &s;eemed to live in &s;eeking opportunities to gratify (if we may venture &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion) &s;o god-like a pa&s;&s;ion. On his vi&s;it to the pe&s;t-hou&s;e near Rotterdam, he has a remark which &s;hows that though his &s;pirit beamed with univer&s;al benevolence, yet this noble effer|ve&s;cence was very capable of being converged to a point, and of glowing
<PB N="16" REF="17">
with all the collected ardour of patrioti&s;m. "I mention this edifice," &s;ays he, "not only as it occurred to me, that it would be a good plan for a hou&s;e of correction, &amp;c. but on account of the veneration it in&s;pired, when I trod on the ground under which &s;uch piles of my countrymen lie buried; it having been u&s;ed as a military ho&s;pital at the &s;iege of Bergen|op-Zoom." With &s;uch &s;entiments of patriot reverence, and with the &s;pi|rit of piety which warmed and animated his bo&s;om, how mu&s;t he have been affected to find the rights of nature and the grand objects of moral reformation le&s;s attended to in the treatment of pri&s;oners in England, than in almo&s;t every other country which he vi&s;ited. Having thus with unwearied a&s;&s;iduity collected much u&s;eful information on the &s;ubject, and having by his benevolence and genero&s;ity wiped many a &s;calding tear from many an eye, he returned to England, and in the year 1777 publi&s;hed his STATE OF PRISONS, which he dedicated to the Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>in gratitude</HI>, as him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>for the encourage|ment which they had given to the de&s;ign, and for the honour they had con|ferred on the author</HI>. At the conclu&s;ion of this edition he pledged him|&s;elf, if the legi&s;lature &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly engage in the reformation of our pri&s;ons, to take a third journey through the Pru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian domi|nions. In the year 1780, a &s;econd edition of this work was publi&s;hed, but not before the performance of the above promi&s;e, the extending of his tour through Italy, and the revi&s;iting of &s;ome of the countries he had before in&s;pected, enabled him to make &s;ome valuable additions to this noble monument of philanthropy.</P>
<P>In vi&s;iting the pri&s;ons at Florence, he was accompanied by Dr. Tar|gioni, who was ordered by his royal highne&s;s to in&s;pect the ho&s;pitals, and report what beneficial improvements might be made in them; and indeed both the grand duke and Sir Horace Mann, our amba&s;&s;ador, paid him every attention, and lent him that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which was due to one who&s;e pur&s;uit was the alleviation of mi&s;ery, and who&s;e bo&s;om vibrated alike to the &s;ufferings of mankind. The year 1779 pre&s;ents us another in&s;tance of the indefatigable indu&s;try with which he devoted him&s;elf to his great and benevolent projects. In January we find him at Dunkirk, at Calais, at Bruges, vi&s;iting his captive countrymen, alle|viating their di&s;tre&s;s, and procuring the redre&s;s of their grievances; at the &s;ame time not forgetting to vi&s;it the ho&s;pitals, &amp;c. of an ho&s;tile country, nor neglecting to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e whom a le&s;s libe|ral heart would have looked upon as foes. In the &s;ame month we find him returned to England, laying an account of the condition of the poor captives before the commi&s;&s;ioners of the &s;ick and wounded &s;eamen, and &s;oliciting their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his intended vi&s;it to the French pri&s;oners confined in different parts of this kingdom.</P>

<P>THIS di&s;tingui&s;hed character is &s;aid by &s;ome, how truly we do not pretend to &s;ay, to have been de&s;cended from a collateral branch of the hou&s;e of Norfolk. Be this as it may, his family was certainly re&s;pecta|ble; his father, an eminent uphol&s;terer and carpet warehou&s;eman in Long-Lane, Smithfield, being related to the Tatnalls, the Cholmleys, and the Barnardi&s;tons. The benevolent character of whom we are now about to write the life, and one &s;i&s;ter, were the only children of this re|putable trader who &s;urvived him. Mr. Howard was born about the year 1724; and it has been reported that Enfield, in Middle&s;ex, had the honour of his birth: but this is probably a mi&s;take, &s;ince no &s;uch entry is to be found in the pari&s;h-regi&s;ter; and the regi&s;ter of the Pre&s;|byterian congregation there does not go &s;o far back. When he had arrived at a proper age, his father, de&s;irous perhaps that he &s;hould in|crea&s;e the fortune which parental indu&s;try had been labouring to pro|cure, fixed upon the profe&s;&s;ion of a whole&s;ale grocer as eligible for his future e&s;tabli&s;hment in life: Mr. Howard was accordingly apprenticed to Mr. Nathaniel Newnham, of Watling-&s;treet (grandfather to the pre|&s;ent alderman of that name), with whom he &s;erved his time. In the meanwhile his father had died; and be&s;ides bequeathing his &s;i&s;ter a hand|&s;ome
<PB N="10" REF="19">
fortune, left him in circum&s;tances narrow indeed, when compared with the ample genero&s;ity of his &s;oul, but &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to have &s;ecured re&s;pect, even if his di&s;tingui&s;hed virtues had not called forth a &s;entiment more warm and more honourable. Indeed, when we con&s;ider with how &s;mall an income this amiable philanthropi&s;t has di&s;pen&s;ed more benefits to mankind than the power and affluence of princes ever be|&s;towed, we are taught to excu&s;e our&s;elves no longer for the little good we do towards &s;ociety, on account of the want of affluence, or the frowns of fortune; and are in&s;tructed, how con&s;iderable a proportion of the happine&s;s imparted by charity depends upon the benevolence of the heart, and the indu&s;try and attention with which that benevolence is carried into execution.&mdash;Mr. Howard does not &s;eem ever to have been very earne&s;t in the pur&s;uit of that increa&s;e of fortune which trade might have procured; and as his health appeared con&s;iderably injured by his atten|tion to bu&s;ine&s;s during his apprentice&s;hip, he now for&s;ook an avocation which he was no longer bound in duty to follow, and, con&s;ulting the re&s;toration of his health, took an apartment in Church-&s;treet, at Stoke Newington, Middle&s;ex. Not &s;atisfied, however, with his accommoda|tions, he &s;ome time after, probably about the time he came of age (which according to his father's will was not till he was twenty-five), removed to an apartment in another hou&s;e, but in the &s;ame &s;treet. The mi&s;tre&s;s of this hou&s;e, Mrs. Sarah Lardeau, though afflicted with the infirmities of advanced life, and troubled with the gout, was neverthele&s;s an agreeable and amiable woman, endowed with a good under&s;tanding and a feeling heart. She was a widow, and her hu&s;band had been clerk at the lead works of Sir James Creed. While Mr. H. re&s;ided here, he was &s;eized with a violent indi&s;po&s;ition, of which he langui&s;hed for a con&s;iderable time. Mrs. Lardeau watched and attended him during his illne&s;s with a tender a&s;&s;iduity, to which he chiefly attributed his recovery. The grateful heart of Mr. Howard knew not how to render a return equal to the obligation, without making his careful ho&s;te&s;s the mi&s;tre&s;s of his fortune. And as gratitude, in tender and be|nevolent minds, is clo&s;ely allied to love, he &s;eems to have made his propo&s;al in terms which &s;hew all the ardour of that pa&s;&s;ion; telling her, that if &s;he did not con&s;ent to marry him, he &s;hould immediately quit his friends and his country, never to &s;ee them more. The lady remon|&s;trated on the difference of their ages, &s;he being turned of fifty, and him&s;elf, at that time, not above twenty-eight. To this he replied, that he could by no other means make a proper return for her kindne&s;s, and that his re&s;olution was immoveable. Having given her twenty-four hours to con&s;ider of his propo&s;al, &s;he con&s;ented, and they were accordingly privately married in the year 1752. Mr. Howard, to com|plete
<PB N="11" REF="20">
his genero&s;ity, made a pre&s;ent to her &s;i&s;ter of the little fortune to which his bride was entitled. For upwards of three years, this excen|tric couple enjoyed a degree of happine&s;s which &s;y&s;tem-builders would have con&s;idered as totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the di&s;parity of their years. In the mean time, dome&s;tic happine&s;s did not make our philanthropi&s;t negligent of further acts of genero&s;ity. Being bred a di&s;&s;enter, and de&s;irous of &s;upporting the re&s;pectability of the preachers in the &s;ect to which he always firmly adhered, he &s;et on foot a &s;ub&s;cription, to which he him&s;elf advanced 50 l. for the purpo&s;e of purcha&s;ing the lea&s;e of a tenement in the vicinity of the meeting-hou&s;e, to be a&s;&s;igned as a dwelling for the mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>On November 10, 1755, his dome&s;tic happine&s;s was terminated by the death of Mrs. Howard; and though (as will be &s;een hereafter) Mr. Howard again entered into the matrimonial &s;tate, the lo&s;s of this his fir&s;t partner was lamented by him with the &s;incere&s;t tenderne&s;s. He erected a monument to her memory in Whitechapel church, and has often been heard to &s;ay, that to her excellent example he owed much of his de&s;ire to be &s;er|viceable to his fellow-creatures. To another adventitious circum&s;tance Mr. Howard, perhaps with ju&s;tice, a&s;cribes the particular direction towards which his active benevolence was &s;o uniformly bia&s;&s;ed: though certain|ly a mind like his could never have been inert in a community where &s;orrow was to be found dropping the dejected tear, or where pain and angui&s;h were heard to breathe their affecting moan. In the year 1756, being de&s;irous of making the tour of Portugal, that he might view the awful ravages made by the earthquake (Nov. 1. 1755) in the city of Li&s;bon; and having been much di&s;&s;uaded by his friends from a de&s;ign which they deemed pre&s;umptuous, he held &s;everal con&s;ultations upon the &s;ubject with a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, with whom he was on terms of intimacy. Having at la&s;t &s;ettled his con&s;cience upon the point, he, about mid&s;ummer, &s;et off and embarked as a pa&s;&s;enger on board the Hanover Li&s;bon packet. But France and England being at that time in a &s;tate of war, the Hanover packet was captured by a French privateer, and carried into Bre&s;t. On this occa&s;ion Mr. Howard was not only a witne&s;s to tho&s;e hard&s;hips to which pri&s;oners are frequently expo&s;ed, but he was al&s;o a &s;harer in all their &s;ufferings. "Before I reached Bre&s;t," &s;ays he, "I &s;uffered the extremity of thir&s;t, not having for above forty hours one drop of water, nor hardly a mor&s;el of food. In the ca&s;tle of Bre&s;t I lay &s;ix nights upon &s;traw; and ob&s;erving how cruelly my countrymen were u&s;ed there, and at Morlaix, whither I was carried next; during the two months I was at Morlaix upon parole, I corre&s;ponded with the Engli&s;h pri&s;oners at Bre&s;t, Morlaix, and Dinnan. I had &s;ufficient evi|dence of their being treated with &s;uch barbarity, that many hundreds
<PB N="12" REF="21">
had peri&s;hed; and that thirty-&s;ix were buried in a hole at Dinnan in one day. Perhaps what I &s;uffered on this occa&s;ion increa&s;ed my &s;ym|pathy with the unhappy people, who&s;e ca&s;e is the &s;ubject of this book." <HI>Howard on Pri&s;ons</HI>, &s;. 1. When Mr. Howard afterward came to Eng|land, &s;till on his parole, he communicated tho&s;e particulars, with which his &s;ufferings or his ob&s;ervation had &s;upplied him upon this &s;ubject, to the commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;ick and wounded pri&s;oners. The information was received with the attention due to the authenticity and the humanity with which it was given: the commi&s;&s;ioners returned their thanks to the informant, cau&s;ed a remon&s;trance to be made to the French court, and thus procured redre&s;s for the captives: tho&s;e at Bre&s;t, Morlaix, and Dinnan, being brought home in the fir&s;t cartel-&s;hips. Nor did Mr. Howard &s;atisfy him&s;elf with merely redre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e mi&s;eries of which he had been partly an involuntary &s;pectator; the circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s &s;unk deep into his mind, and made &s;o indelible an impre&s;&s;ion, as to in|fluence his conduct through every future &s;tage of his life. He &s;oon found that France was not the only country in which there was cau&s;e for like complaints, and that pri&s;oners of war were not the only &s;ufferers by the loath&s;ome inconveniences which give additional horrors to the lo&s;s of liberty. In England&mdash;in his own county, he found that the debtor and the felon were equal &s;harers in the di&s;ea&s;es and di&s;tre&s;&s;es incident to confinement, un&s;oftened by humanity, and unalleviated by any of tho&s;e attentions by which health might be pre&s;erved. And though he plainly &s;aw the inju&s;tice of cla&s;&s;ing both the&s;e de&s;criptions of unhappy beings to|gether under the &s;ame general puni&s;hment, yet his &s;trong benevolence would not admit that even guilt ought to &s;uffer beyond what ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity demands. "I grant," &s;ays he, after &s;peaking of pri&s;oners of war, "there is a material difference in the <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> of foreign and dome&s;tic pri&s;oners; but there is none in their <HI>nature</HI>. Debtors and felons, as well as ho&s;tile foreigners, are <HI>men</HI>, and by men they ought to be treated as &s;uch. Tho&s;e gentlemen who, when they are told of the mi&s;ery which our pri&s;oners &s;uffer, content them&s;elves with &s;aying, <HI>Let them take care and keep out</HI>, prefaced perhaps with an angry prayer, &s;eem not duly &s;en&s;ible of the favour of Providence, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the &s;ufferers; they do not remember that we are required to imitate our gracious hea|venly Parent, <HI>who is kind to the unthankful and the evil:</HI> they al&s;o forget the vici&s;&s;itudes of human affairs, the unexpected changes to which all men are liable: and that tho&s;e who&s;e circum&s;tances are affluent, may in time be reduced to indigence, and them&s;elves become debtors and pri&s;oners. And as to criminality, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, that a man who has often &s;hud|dered at hearing the account of a murder, may on a &s;udden temptation
<PB N="13" REF="22">
commit that very crime. <HI>Let him that thinks he &s;tands, take heed le&s;t be fall</HI>, and commi&s;erate tho&s;e that are fallen."</P>
<P>But to return to the narrative. After the di&s;agreeable affair at France, Mr. H. again vi&s;ited the Continent, and made the tour of Italy, from whence he returned about the beginning of the year 1758; and on the 25th of April en&s;uing married Mi&s;s Harriet Leeds, only daughter of Edward Leeds, E&s;q. of Croxton, in the county of Cambridge, king's &s;erjeant, and &s;i&s;ter to E. Leeds, E&s;q. ma&s;ter in chancery, and late M. P. for Rye|gate. He then retired to the &s;eque&s;tered villa of Brokenhur&s;t, in the New Fore&s;t, near Lymington in Hamp&s;hire, where for &s;ome time he fixed his re&s;idence. Seven years after this, Mrs. Howard was delivered of a &s;on, the only child of Mr. H. and &s;hortly after expired. This unfortunate child has been the cau&s;e of much angui&s;h of heart to the benevolent ob|ject of the&s;e pages; and, what is &s;till more cruel, his misfortunes have been the cau&s;e of much unmerited calumny and reproach; but of this we &s;hall &s;peak in its proper place. After the lo&s;s of his &s;econd wife, Mr. Howard removed from the villa of Brokenhur&s;t to an e&s;tate which he purcha&s;ed at Cardington, in Bedford&s;hire, in the vicinity of that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Mr. Whitbread, M. P. who is his relation by the father's &s;ide. We believe we may truly &s;ay, that wherever Mr. H. fixed his re&s;idence, the ble&s;&s;ings of the poor were &s;ure to be heard, and the wiped eye of mi|&s;ery infallibly proclaimed his benevolence; at lea&s;t, this is well known to have been the ca&s;e while he remained at Cardington, where he furni&s;hed employment for many for the mere purpo&s;e of affording them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; built cottages for others, and extended his kind &s;olicitude to all. The only condition he ever impo&s;ed upon tho&s;e whom he thus favoured with his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was, that they &s;hould attend every Sunday at &s;ome place of public wor&s;hip, according to the religion which they profe&s;&s;ed. This he always religiou&s;ly performed him&s;elf, walking on the morning of every Sabbath to Bedford, that he might attend one of the meeting-hou&s;es there, and returning home on foot at night. His &s;on, in the meanwhile, had been con&s;igned to the mi&s;tre&s;s of a lady's boarding-&s;chool for in&s;truction, where by mi&s;management he had contracted an impedi|ment in his &s;peech. Notwith&s;tanding this, the excentricity of Mr. H. prompted him to form the de&s;ign of bringing him up to the mini&s;try; and for that purpo&s;e he removed the unfortunate youth to an academy for the in&s;truction of the children of di&s;&s;enters, at Pinner, kept by Mr. Magie. But every pro&s;pect which parental partiality might have formed was clouded by the vi&s;itation of Providence, and this unfortunate youth was obliged to be con&s;igned to the care of Dr. T. Arnold, who kept a hou&s;e for the reception of Iunatics at Leice&s;ter. Whether this derange|ment of intellects, from which the unhappy youth has never recovered,
<PB N="14" REF="23">
took place before or after Mr. Howard had entered upon that eager ca|reer of benevolence to which the remainder of his life was devoted, we cannot &s;ay for a certainty; but it is probable that it happened a little before. The private affections of his heart had now no longer any cheerful claim upon his attention; and, naturally as the di&s;&s;ipated fly from &s;orrow to the bu&s;tle of noi&s;y plea&s;ure, &s;o in&s;tinctively do the benevolent endeavour to lo&s;e the remembrance of private angui&s;h in exertions for the public good.</P>
<P>In order that he might be the better enabled to examine into tho&s;e evils, of which there was &s;o much cau&s;e to complain, and to im|power him&s;elf to redre&s;s them as far as the &s;phere of his ability could be extended, in the year 1773, Mr. Howard took upon him&s;elf the office of &s;heriff for the county of Bedford, although the cir|cum&s;tance of his being a di&s;&s;enter would have excu&s;ed him from &s;o trouble&s;ome a &s;ituation. On this account there were &s;ome few &s;cru|ples in his bo&s;om relative to the &s;afety with which he might di&s;|charge the office, and the danger of incurring the penalties of non|conformity. But having con&s;ulted &s;ome friends of eminence in the law, he did not find &s;o much rea&s;on to dread that the act would be enforced, as was &s;ufficient to deter him from his benevolent de&s;igns. This is not the only in&s;tance in which Mr. Howard has expo&s;ed his fortune to in|jury, and endeavoured (though always aver&s;e to popularity) to bring him&s;elf forward into public life, for the &s;ake of advancing tho&s;e great intere&s;ts of humanity which were the grand objects of pur&s;uit through his bu&s;y life. At the general election, the following year, he en|deavoured to &s;ecure a &s;eat in parliament for the borough of Bedford, that he might be the better enabled to effect a national reforma|tion of our pri&s;ons, ho&s;pitals, &amp;c. It will hardly be credited in a fu|ture period, that what &s;hould have made all mankind anxious for the &s;ecurity of his election, was the very circum&s;tance which ren|dered his de&s;ign abortive. There were per&s;ons who&s;e prejudices, or who&s;e want of feeling, rendered them de&s;irous of di&s;appointing his li|beral de&s;igns; and Sir William Wake, Bart. was brought into parliament in oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;t of this great philanthropi&s;t, though &s;up|ported by his relation Mr. Whitbread, and by the prayers and wi&s;hes of &s;o many benevolent characters.</P>
<P>But to return: during his &s;heriffalty he made a particular and anxious &s;crutiny into the &s;tate of pri&s;ons in the county of Bedford, and al&s;o occa&s;ioned very con&s;iderable reformations of the many abu&s;es which he di&s;covered. In the&s;e and his future vi&s;its to the various loath&s;ome dungeons which vindictive ju&s;tice has invented, and which negligence and inhumanity have contributed to render noxious and abhorrent, his
<PB N="15" REF="24">
only precautions to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from infection were, never to enter an ho&s;pital or pri&s;on before breakfa&s;t, and in an offen&s;ive room never to draw his breath deeply, to &s;mell at vinegar while he was in tho&s;e places, and to change his apparel afterwards; the la&s;t two of which precautions, after habit had rendered him le&s;s timid, he entirely omitted. When he was interrogated how he could venture to expo&s;e him&s;elf to &s;uch dan|gers, it was his u&s;ual an&s;wer, "That, next to the free goodne&s;s and mercy of the Author of his being, temperance and cleanline&s;s were his pre&s;ervatives; and that tru&s;ting in <HI>divine providence</HI>, and believing him|&s;elf in the way of his duty, he vi&s;ited the noxious cells; and while thus employed <HI>he feared no evil</HI>." While we admire the genuine piety which dictated this &s;entiment, &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals cannot but lament that &s;uch are the in&s;crutable ways of Providence, that humanity and con&s;cious rectitude could not at all times pre&s;erve the philanthropi&s;t from the fatal influence of tainted vapours; but that, after having avoided all in|fections, till in the year 1783, at his la&s;t vi&s;it to the <HI>Tour de St. Pierre</HI> at Li&s;le, he &s;hould not only then have caught the fever there, but &s;hould at a future period have imbibed a fatal di&s;temper, which has finally deprived human nature of its noble&s;t ornament, and &s;ociety of its true&s;t friend.&mdash;The object which mo&s;t affected the mind of the philanthropi&s;t in &s;urveying the Engli&s;h pri&s;ons, was the cruel practice of detaining pri&s;oners, after acquittal, for their fees, and other oppre&s;&s;ive demands of a &s;imilar nature. To remedy this, he applied to the ju&s;tices to a&s;&s;ign to the gaoler and others certain &s;alaries in lieu of fees; but as no precedent for this could be recollected, Mr. Howard, unwilling his de&s;ign &s;hould be prevented by &s;uch an excu&s;e, vi&s;ited the neighbouring counties in que&s;t of one: but he only found additional &s;cenes of horror and di&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e exertions &s;oon attracted the notice of the nation; and in March, 1774, he was examined in the Hou&s;e of Commons upon the &s;ubject. Happily Mr. Howard was endowed with great fluency of &s;peech; and as this circum&s;tance enabled him to communicate his ob&s;ervations with ea&s;e and &s;ucce&s;s, the information he afforded, and the humanity with which he had collected, and with which he now illu&s;trated his remarks, drew upon him the thanks of the Hou&s;e; and, which to his heart afforded far &s;uperior &s;atisfaction, was productive of &s;erious regard to the &s;itua|tion of the unhappy pri&s;oners. Soon after, Mr. Popham, member for Taunton, repeated the humane attempt which had mi&s;carried a few years before, and brought in a bill for the relief of pri&s;oners who &s;hould be acquitted&mdash;re&s;pecting their fees; and another bill for pre&s;erving the health of pri&s;oners, and preventing the gaol-di&s;temper; both of which pa&s;&s;ed that &s;e&s;&s;ions. But as acts of parliament are u&s;ually printed in black letter, which many (e&s;pecially in country places) cannot read,
<PB N="16" REF="25">
Mr. Howard, aware of how much importance it was that the humane decrees of the &s;enate &s;hould be properly di&s;&s;eminated, had the&s;e two bills printed in the Roman character at his own expence, and &s;ent them to the keepers of every county gaol in England. "By the&s;e acts," &s;ays the philanthropi&s;t, "the tear was wiped from many an eye; and the legi&s;lature had for them <HI>the ble&s;&s;ings of tho&s;e that were ready to peri&s;h</HI>." The abu&s;es, the mi&s;eries, and the extortions which he di&s;covered in the gaols within his own and neighbouring counties, prompted him to exa|mine tho&s;e in other parts of the kingdom; and in the years 1773, 74 and 75, he travelled all over England, Ireland, and Scotland, and vi&s;ited all the pri&s;ons in each, examining with that anxious curio&s;ity which a de&s;ire to benefit the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of his fellow-creatures had in&s;pired, into every abu&s;e, and carefully noting down every circum&s;tance which re|quired redre&s;s, or which, on the contrary, might appear worthy of imi|tation. In one of the&s;e vi&s;its to Hor&s;ham gaol, with the keeper, he &s;aw a heap of &s;tones and rubbi&s;h lying in &s;uch a manner as to excite &s;u&s;picion; and upon examination found that the felons had been undermining the cells. They had been at work two or three days, and that very night was fixed upon for a general e&s;cape. So far had they proceeded in their plan, that had they been re&s;olute or abandoned enough when they found that they were di&s;covered, to have murdered their detectors, nothing could have prevented their ru&s;hing out and making their e&s;cape. But perhaps, &s;ince there is no condition of humanity &s;o deba&s;ed or abandoned as to be entirely dead to the impre&s;&s;ive &s;entiment of gratitude, the eye of him who had braved for their &s;akes the dangers of the loath&s;ome cell, might overawe tho&s;e who were equal to the perpetration of any crime but that which would have &s;hortened the life of Howard.</P>
<P>Our traveller frequently found that the gaolers, con&s;cious of negli|gence and improper conduct, endeavoured, by artifice, to prevent him from pro&s;ecuting his inquiry. For this purpo&s;e they would pretend the utmo&s;t willingne&s;s to accompany him, but at the &s;ame time hint a fear of danger from <HI>the fever</HI> among the pri&s;oners. But Howard was not to be thus intimidated; he always proceeded, and generally found that the di&s;covery of the filthy and neglected &s;tate of the pri&s;on was, in fact, the object of their apprehen&s;ions. Frequently however the cells and ha|bitations, thus inve&s;tigated, were &s;ufficiently offen&s;ive to have deterred any one from entering who was not &s;timulated by the noble motive o$ philanthropic &s;ympathy; and Mr. Howard him&s;elf found, that after &s;uch vi&s;its his cloaths &s;o far imbibed the noxious effluvia, that he was unable to endure a po&s;t-chai&s;e, unle&s;s all the windows were down&punc; This circum&s;tance compelled him to travel at all hours, and in all wea+thers, on hor&s;eback, expo&s;ed to all the dangers of the road, which how+ever
<PB N="17" REF="26">
he did without mole&s;tation, never experiencing any of tho&s;e inter|ruptions or di&s;a&s;ters, of which the rumours are &s;o innumerable.</P>
<P>With how con&s;tant and re&s;tle&s;s an a&s;&s;iduity he pro&s;ecuted his inquiries, &mdash;and how completely his life was devoted to this object, may be ga|thered from the extent of his travels, and the number of his remarks; and we find him, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame month (January 1775) re|lieving the angui&s;h of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed pri&s;oners in Ireland, and reforming the abu&s;es which had crept into the gaols in Scotland. It was in this month, that in the latter of the&s;e countries, the magi&s;trates of Gla&s;gow, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful and ho&s;pitable manner pre&s;ented him the freedom of their city, as a te&s;timony of that admiration which his conduct had excited. The &s;ame honour was conferred upon him, on a future and &s;imilar occa&s;ion, by the city of Edinburgh, as al&s;o by that of Liver|pool, and &s;everal other corporations.</P>
<P>Having thus made him&s;elf thoroughly acquainted with the &s;tate of pri&s;ons in England, in Scotland, and Ireland, he returned to England in the &s;pring of the year 1775, with the de&s;ign of publi&s;hing his account of them, that thus the public might be &s;timulated to redre&s;s tho&s;e grie|vances, which his private exertions could not remove. But conjectur|ing that &s;ome u&s;eful information on this &s;ubject might be collected abroad, and willing to extend the advantages of his labours to foreign countries, he laid a&s;ide his papers, and travelled into France, Flanders, Holland, and Germany. The benefits he had thus an opportunity of di&s;pen&s;ing to mankind, induced him to repeat his journey in the year 1776, adding Switzerland to the countries which had before challenged his ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>At the Hague, the friendly interference of Sir Jo&s;eph Yorke, by pro|curing to the philanthropi&s;t every a&s;&s;i&s;tance which could facilitate the in|quiry in which he was engaged, reflected con&s;iderable honour on that re&s;pected amba&s;&s;ador. Nor in Germany were there wanting tho&s;e who were eager to &s;hare the honour of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the philanthropic de&s;igns of this illu&s;trious citizen of the world. The &s;ame year the friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s of the &s;enator <HI>Voght</HI>, at Hamburgh, procured him every ad|vantage of introduction and information, in vi&s;iting the various pri&s;ons in that great and opulent city. Mr. Howard did not in the&s;e, or indeed in any other of his travels, confine his ob&s;ervations to pri&s;ons only; the ho&s;pitals and charitable in&s;titutions of various denominations, were al&s;o the objects of his care: in &s;hort, to do good to the mi&s;erable and friend|le&s;s part of his fellow-creatures, was a de&s;ire interwoven with his very exi&s;tence, and he only &s;eemed to live in &s;eeking opportunities to gratify (if we may venture &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion) &s;o god-like a pa&s;&s;ion. On his vi&s;it to the pe&s;t-hou&s;e near Rotterdam, he has a remark which &s;hows that
<PB N="18" REF="27">
though his &s;pirit beamed with univer&s;al benevolence, yet this noble effer|ve&s;cence was very capable of being converged to a point, and of glowing with all the collected ardour of patrioti&s;m. "I mention this edifice," &s;ays he, "not only as it occurred to me, that it would be a good plan for a hou&s;e of correction, &amp;c. but on account of the veneration it in&s;pired, when I trod on the ground under which &s;uch piles of my countrymen lie buried; it having been u&s;ed as a military ho&s;pital at the &s;iege of Bergen|op-Zoom." With &s;uch &s;entiments of patriot affection, and with the &s;pi|rit of piety which warmed and animated his bo&s;om, how mu&s;t he have been affected to find the rights of nature, and the grand objects of moral reformation, le&s;s attended to in the treatment of pri&s;oners in England, than in almo&s;t every other country which he vi&s;ited. Having thus with unwearied a&s;&s;iduity collected much u&s;eful information on the &s;ubject, and having by his benevolence and genero&s;ity wiped many a &s;calding tear from many an eye, he returned to England, and in the year 1777 publi&s;hed his STATE OF PRISONS, which he dedicated to the Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>in gratitude</HI>, as him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>for the encourage|ment which they had given to the de&s;ign, and for the honour they had con|ferred on the author</HI>. At the conclu&s;ion of this edition he pledged him|&s;elf, if the legi&s;lature &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly engage in the reformation of our pri&s;ons, to take a third journey through the Pru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian domi|nions. In the year 1780, a &s;econd edition of this work was publi&s;hed, but not before the performance of the above promi&s;e, the extending of his tour through Italy, and the revi&s;iting of &s;ome of the countries he had before in&s;pected, enabled him to make &s;ome valuable additions to this noble monument of philanthropy.</P>
<P>In vi&s;iting the pri&s;ons at Florence, he was accompanied by Dr. Tar|gioni, who was ordered by his royal highne&s;s to in&s;pect the ho&s;pitals, and report what beneficial improvements might be made in them; and indeed both the grand duke and Sir Horace Mann, our amba&s;&s;ador, paid him every attention, and lent him that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which was due to one who&s;e pur&s;uit was the alleviation of mi&s;ery, and who&s;e bo&s;om vibrated alike to the &s;ufferings of mankind. The year 1779 pre&s;ents us another in&s;tance of the indefatigable indu&s;try with which he devoted him&s;elf to his great and benevolent projects. In January we find him at Dunkirk, at Calais, at Bruges, vi&s;iting his captive countrymen, alle|viating their di&s;tre&s;s, and procuring the redre&s;s of their grievances; at the &s;ame time not forgetting to vi&s;it the ho&s;pitals, &amp;c. of an ho&s;tile country, nor neglecting to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e whom a le&s;s libe|ral h$art would have looked upon as foes. In the &s;ame month we find him returned to England, laying an account of the condition of the poor captives before the commi&s;&s;ioners of the &s;ick and wounded &s;eamen, and
<PB N="19" REF="28">
&s;oliciting their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his intended vi&s;it to the French pri&s;oners confined in different parts of this kingdom. From the&s;e gentlemen he readily procured letters, which threw open all the pri&s;ons to his in|&s;pection, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in procuring whatever information he might be de&s;irous to obtain. Thus a&s;&s;i&s;ted, he proceeded in the pro&s;ecution of his benevolent de&s;igns; and during the &s;ame year examined the pri&s;ons at Plymouth, at Bri&s;tol, at Winche&s;ter, at Forton, Deal, Car|li&s;le, Pembroke, Che&s;ter, and Liverpool; and in &s;everal parts of Scotland, and in Ireland. In the&s;e vi&s;its, he did not confine his hu|manity to mere inquiry into the calamities he was endeavouring to redre&s;s: he procured the relea&s;e of &s;everal boys, and others, confined for their fees, by compounding and paying the demands of the officers. Some of the&s;e poor wretches were &s;hivering in filth and nakedne&s;s; &s;ome were laid up with the &s;mall-pox, or &s;inking into con&s;umptions; and many had wives and children who were &s;tarving around them: but the only effect this had upon the clerks of the peace, and others con|cerned, was, as Mr. Howard informs us, to induce them to compound for half their fees. With &s;ome &s;heriffs, however, he prevailed to have the unfortunate wretches relea&s;ed from the&s;e inhuman demands&punc; Mr. Howard, however (in the way of that particular object to which his la|bours tended) was as far from being backward at be&s;towing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his property, as of his labour and his thoughts. He &s;eems hardly ever to have entered the walls of a pri&s;on without di&s;pen&s;ing pecuniary relief to the objects of di&s;tre&s;s immured in its gloomy walls. In France, too, we find him vi&s;iting the Grand Ch&acirc;telet on tho&s;e days when the allowance of the pri&s;oners is mo&s;t &s;canty; becau&s;e at &s;uch times, as him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, a &s;mall donation of wine was mo&s;t ac|ceptable: and when at Ru&s;&s;ia, where he attended the horrible puni&s;h|ment of the knoot, his liberality afforded all the con&s;olation of which poor wretches, almo&s;t expiring under their cruel puni&s;hment, could be &s;en&s;ible. But to return: the pious labours of the year 1779 were not yet clo&s;ed. Mr. Howard had previou&s;ly made much inquiry into the condition and u&s;age of tran&s;ports: but Mr. Eden's bill for re|&s;traints and puni&s;hments in lieu of tran&s;portation, which pa&s;&s;ed in the 16th of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, rendered the detail of abu&s;es and cruelties in this department unnece&s;&s;ary; he therefore &s;uppre&s;&s;ed what might have excited indignation, without the po&s;&s;ibility of producing any ad|vantage. The wretched convicts &s;till however were not neglected by this pattern of humanity: he had &s;earched into the needle&s;s oppre&s;|&s;ions and mi&s;eries of the&s;e poor creatures, and had cau&s;ed a parliamen|tary inquiry and a reformation to take place on their behalf in the
<PB N="20" REF="29">
year 1778; and now, on his return from Ireland in the month of No|vember, he revi&s;ited the hulks at Woolwich, to &s;ee how far the regu|lations, voted in the &s;enate, had been carried into the execution.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, an act of parliament was pa&s;&s;ed for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of penitentiary hou&s;es; and Mr. Howard was appointed by his Maje&s;ty &s;upervi&s;or of them, an appointment which he accepted, on condition that Dr. Fothergill &s;hould be appointed his a&s;&s;ociate: to the&s;e was added Geo. Whatley, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> trea&s;urer of the Foundling Ho&s;|pital. The &s;pot fixed upon by our philanthropi&s;t and Dr. Fothergill for the building, was a piece of ground at I&s;lington, near to that where Penton Ville chapel now &s;tands. In this, however, they were op|po&s;ed by Mr. Whatley, who in&s;i&s;ted that it &s;hould be erected on or near the I&s;le of Dogs. In this &s;tate of affairs, unfortunately, our phi|lanthropi&s;t lo&s;t his worthy colleague Dr. Fothergill; and finding, after his death, no pro&s;pect of bringing the di&s;pute to the i&s;&s;ue he wi&s;hed, he, in January 1781, re&s;igned his &s;upervi&s;or&s;hip, by the fol|lowing letter to Earl Bathur&s;t, lord pre&s;ident of the privy council:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"When Sir William Black&s;tone prevailed upon me to act as a &s;u|pervi&s;or of the buildings intended for the confinement of certain cri|minals, I was per&s;uaded to think that my ob&s;ervations on &s;imilar in&s;ti|tutions in foreign countries would, in &s;ome degree, qualify me to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the execution of the &s;tatute of the 19th year of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. With this hope, and the pro&s;pect of being a&s;&s;ociated with my late worthy friend Dr. Fothergill, who&s;e wi&s;hes and ideas upon this &s;ub|ject I knew entirely corre&s;ponded with my own, I cheerfully accepted his Maje&s;ty's appointment, and have &s;ince earne&s;tly endeavoured to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of it; but, at the end of two years, I have the mortification to find that not even a preliminary has been &s;ettled. The <HI>&s;ituation</HI> of the buildi$ has been made a matter of ob&s;tinate con|tention, and is at this moment undecided. Judging, therefore, from what is pa&s;&s;ed, that the further &s;acrifice of my time is not likely to contribute to the &s;ucce&s;s of the plan, and being now deprived, by the death of Dr. Fothergill, of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a worthy colleague, I beg leave to &s;ignify to your lord&s;hip my determination to re&s;ign all further concern in the bu&s;ine&s;s; and to de&s;ire that your lord&s;hip will be &s;o good as to lay before the king my humble reque&s;t, that his Maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to accept my re&s;ignation, and to appoint &s;ome other gentleman to the office of &s;upervi&s;or in my place. I have the honour," &amp;c.</P>

<P>But he by no means, at the &s;ame time, re&s;igned his zeal to be &s;er|viceable to the cau&s;e of humanity, and to promote the reformation
<PB N="21" REF="30">
and alleviate the mi&s;eries of the unhappy criminals. He &s;eems to have con&s;idered his efforts in this re&s;pect as a kind of mi&s;&s;ion frome Heaven; and, from the peculiar bias of his mind, to have &s;ometimes looked upon the mo&s;t natural occurrences as proofs of the interpo&s;ition of Providence in favour of his &s;cheme. This &s;entiment particularly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, when, on the death of his &s;i&s;ter, he found that &s;he had left all her property to him, without making any provi&s;ion for his &s;on. By this circum&s;tance, be&s;ides the acqui&s;ition of a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, a hou&s;e in Great Ormond-&s;treet was added to tho&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at Clap|ton, Hackney, Ivey-lane, and Cardington, and his landed property at Enfield; and he &s;eems to have con&s;idered them all together as forming a fund for the benefit of the pri&s;oner and the wretched. He therefore proceeded to appropriate it accordingly; and, in Dec. 1782, and Oct. 1783, repeated his vi&s;its to the hulks at Woolwich. On the la&s;t of the&s;e occa&s;ions, finding &s;ome &s;ickly felons, he immediately revi&s;ited the county gaol in Southwark, and others, from whence they had been drafted: the&s;e he found had relap&s;ed into their former &s;tate of loath&s;ome negligence; and he had all his pains for their reformation to repeat. Mr. Howard was not, however, at all times doomed to the mortification of finding that the unfeeling carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the magi|&s;trates and gentry of the re&s;pective counties &s;uffered his humane efforts to be una&s;&s;i&s;ted, and the regulations he had effected to langui&s;h and decay. He was plea&s;ed to find that Sir Charles Whitworth, chairman of the We&s;tmin&s;ter charity, and Dr. W. Smith, were, in the me|tropolis, careful to advance the work which he had already begun. The gentlemen of the county of York entered into his benevolent plans with a degree of public &s;pirit, which reflected the highe&s;t honour on their hearts and under&s;tandings; and that active and worthy ma|gi&s;trate, the Rev. Mr. Zouch, tran&s;mitted to him the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timonies of their admiration. Nor were foreigners more backward to a&s;&s;i&s;t and to applaud his benevolent de&s;igns: for when, in 1781, he travelled through Holland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Poland; and again in the year 1783, through Portugal, Spain, France, Flanders and Holland, &s;everal per&s;ons of the fir&s;t con&s;equence were proud to &s;hew every degree of friend&s;hip and honour to one, who&s;e virtues added dignity to human nature. In Holland, during the fir&s;t of the&s;e journies, he was aided by the attentions of profe&s;&s;or Camper; and al&s;o by Sir Jo&s;eph York, who&s;e attentions, on a former occa&s;ion, are mentioned in the&s;e memoirs, and who now not only ex|$rted him&s;elf with ardour to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of our traveller's en|quiries; but, while he was confined at the Hague, in con&s;equence of
<PB N="22" REF="31">
an accident, &s;hewed him every kind regard of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip. And in Germany (though a ba&s;e minded gaoler was unwilling to &s;hew the torture-room, le&s;t his active benevolence &s;hould drag forth the horrors of cruelty to public view, and procure the abolition of practices abhorrent to nature) yet there were &s;everal in the mo&s;t elevated rank who di&s;covered a very different di&s;po&s;ition. And altho' at Stockholm $e was compelled to be re&s;olute, before a being of the &s;ame de&s;cription, who had neglected to wall up the torture dungeon, though, in con|&s;equence of Mr. Howard's exertions, the King had publi&s;hed a decree for that purpo&s;e; yet the friendly behaviour of Count de Firmain, go|vernor of Lombardy, the attentions of the Mar&s;hal-de-Vellere at Elvas, of Dr. Haller, in Switzerland, of Count Campomanes at Madrid, &amp;c. plainly proved, that more enlightened minds had caught a con&s;iderable pro|portion of that &s;pirit of philanthropy which glowed in his own bo&s;om. But that which gratified the Philanthropi&s;t mo&s;t, was to find that many of the abu&s;es and the horrors which he had by his former journies made known, were now, by the interference of tho&s;e in power, con&s;iderably reformed. Princes had blu&s;hed to find a foreigner more awake to &s;ym|pathy than them&s;elves to the groans and mi&s;eries of their wretched &s;ubjects; and the Pri&s;ons, Ho&s;pitals, and the Pe&s;t-hou&s;es in Brun&s;wick, Geneva, France, and a variety of other places, were now in a &s;ituation much more fit for the re&s;idence of human beings; and even the wretched &s;laves in the Stockhou&s;e in Denmark, "To whom hope never comes, that comes to all," felt the cheering influence of his benevolence in the regulations which &s;oftened the rigour of their fate. At his third vi&s;it to Paris (1783) he al&s;o found two of the wor&s;t pri&s;ons entirely demoli&s;hed; and learned that the King's declaration had made &s;everal very humane regulations, particularly for the abolition of dungeons under ground,&mdash; upon this principle, that it is unju&s;t for tho&s;e who may po&s;&s;ibly be in|nocent, to &s;uffer, before trial, a rigorous puni&s;hment. It was, however, in vain that Mr. Howard endeavoured to gain admittance to the Ba&s;tile; nor was he more &s;ucee&s;sful at Rome, or at Li&s;bon, in his attempts to explore the Chambers of the Inqui&s;ition; and though at Madrid, he was introduced by Count Campomanes to the Inqui&s;itor General, in 1783, the Tribunal was the only part of the pri&s;on he was permitted to &s;ee. The letters of the &s;ame nobleman procured him but little more &s;atisfaction at Valladolid. Here he was received in the Inqui&s;ition-room by two of the Inqui&s;itors, their &s;ecretaries, and two magi&s;trates, and conducted into &s;everal rooms. On the &s;ide of one was the pictu$ of an <HI>Auto-de-F&eacute;e</HI>; or, as Pegna, a famous Spani&s;h inqui&s;itor, calls the proce&s;&s;ion, <HI>Horrendum ac tremcudum Spectacul$m</HI>, in 1667, when 97 per|&s;ons were burnt. The tribunal-room was hung with red: over the inqui|&s;itor's
<PB N="23" REF="32">
&s;eat there was a crucifix, and before it a table with two &s;eats for the two &s;ecretaries, and a &s;tool for the pri&s;oner; an altar, and a door (with three locks) into the &s;ecretary's room, over which was in&s;cribed, that the greater excommunication was denounced again&s;t all &s;trangers who pre&s;ume to enter. In two other Tribunal-rooms were the <HI>In&s;ignia</HI> of the Inqui&s;ition, which are a cro&s;s between a palm and a &s;word. In a large room, on the floor and &s;helves, were a number of prohibited books, &s;ome of which were Engli&s;h: in another room were multitudes of cro&s;&s;es, beads, and &s;mall pictures, The painted cap was al&s;o &s;hewn, and the ve&s;tments for the unhappy victims. After &s;everal con&s;ultations, he was permitted to go up the private &s;tair-ca&s;e, by which pri&s;oners are brought to the Tribunal. But the grand object of this &s;earch was pre|vented. Through the &s;everal doors, in the pa&s;&s;age to which this &s;tair|ca&s;e leads, he was not permitted to pa&s;s. On being told that none but Pri&s;oners ever enter the&s;e rooms, "I will be confined a month," ex|claims the philanthophi&s;t, in the ardour of his heart, "to &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity:" but the &s;ecretary replied that none came out under three years; and then not till they had taken the oath of &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>We have mentioned the a&s;&s;iduous indu&s;try with which Mr. Howard exerted his benevolence in the year 1779. But this was not peculiar to that period. In the year 1782 he again revi&s;ited all the pri&s;ons in England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, which he had in&s;pected in the year 1779, be&s;ides tho&s;e of Hull, Lincoln, Shrew&s;bury, Yar|mouth, and Old Newgate, in Ireland. In this kingdom, he this year reported to the Hou&s;e of Commons, the &s;tate of pri&s;ons in Dublin; in con&s;equence of which, two of the commi&s;&s;ioners from that Hou&s;e, taking into con&s;ideration the regulation of goals, were appointed to examine with him the New Pri&s;on. The College of Dublin, at the &s;ame time, conferred upon him the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timonies of ad|miration; and, what afforded him infinitely more &s;atisfaction, Mr. Provo&s;t Hutchin&s;on brought a bill into the Iri&s;h Parliament, which pa&s;&s;ed, for di&s;charging the unhappy pri&s;oners confined for fees; and the Lord Lieutenant, Temple, took up, very warmly, the cau&s;e of the unhappy pri&s;oners. In the year 1783 al&s;o (notwith&s;tanding the various pri&s;ons and ho&s;pitals he vi&s;ited on the continent, he found time to make per&s;onal ob&s;ervations on the condition of the pri&s;oners of war, &amp;c. at Falmouth, in Ireland, and other places. In every one of the vi&s;ita|tions to the innumerable pri&s;ons which have been the objects of Mr. Howard's in&s;pection, he con&s;tantly entered every room, cell, and dun|geon, with a memorandum-book in his hand, in which he noted par|ticulars upon the &s;pot. So that when we con&s;ider the time nece&s;&s;arily devoted to ob&s;ervation, to travel, to arranging, and to preparing for the public the information he had obtained upon this &s;ubject, we &s;hall find
<PB N="24" REF="33">
that every hour of his life mu&s;t have been dedicated to benevolence, and that he pur&s;ued it with more avidity than ever &s;en&s;uali&s;t pur&s;ued the meaner plea&s;ures of &s;elf-gratification. Nor did he &s;top here: Virtue, as well as vice, becomes bolder by habitual practice; and from braving the noxious effluvia of a gaol, our philanthropi&s;t &s;oon became encouraged to face contagion in her wilde&s;t &s;hape, and to ex|tend his ob&s;ervations to the pe&s;tilential caverns of bloated de&s;pair, and &s;tretch forth the kindly hand of relief to the wretched victims pining in their horrible rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>For the&s;e purpo&s;es, and that he might be enabled to point out the proper means of effectually preventing the plague from ever being again introduced into this country, and al&s;o might a&s;&s;i&s;t in pointing out to tho&s;e nations which are frequently inflicted with that dreadful &s;courge, the mo&s;t eligible means of avoiding or removing its melan|choly effects, he again departed from his native land, in Nov. 1785, and vi&s;ited the lazerettos of Mar&s;eilles, Genoa, Spezia, Leghora, Naples, Malta, Zante, Corfu, and Ca&s;tel Novo. At Leghorn, where they are the be&s;t conducted of any in Europe, there are three lazaret|tos, one having been building at Mr. Howard's former vi&s;it to this place, in 1778: to this new building (which, in compliment to the grand duke, is called <HI>San</HI> Leopoldo) as al&s;o to that of San Rocco, the governor of the city, Federigo Barbolani, accompanied the philan|thropi&s;t. At the upper end of one of the courts is placed the &s;tatue of the duke, who &s;eems truly worthy of this honour, being, as Mr. Howard &s;ays he is well convinced, the father of his country. After vi&s;iting the&s;e lazarettos, Mr. Howard &s;ailed to Smyrna, and from thence to Con&s;tantinople, where Sir Robert Ain&s;lie, our amba&s;&s;ador, kindly invited him to fix his re&s;idence at his hou&s;e. During his &s;tay there, it was his con&s;tant practice to vi&s;it all the loath&s;ome and in|fected places, introducing him&s;elf, as was always his practice, as a phy&s;ician. Nor did he &s;cruple, in the open air, feeling the pul&s;es of people whom he knew to be infected: he, however, always took the precaution to keep to the windward, being of opinion, that the infec|tion (like that near carrion) chiefly lurks to the leeward. He al&s;o, to inve&s;tigate more thoroughly the modes of treating the plague at Zante, Smyrna, and other places, held frequent con&s;ultations with the Greek and other phy&s;icians; having, for that purpo&s;e, before his departure from England, been furni&s;hed by his friends, Dr. Aikin and Dr. Jebb, with a &s;et of queries re&s;pecting the plague.&mdash;During this vi&s;it to Con|&s;tantinople, he not only explored the pri&s;ons and ho&s;pitals, in hopes of producing general reformations, but was attentive al&s;o to the allevia|tion of individual &s;orrow. It is &s;aid, that, among other b$nevolent
<PB N="25" REF="34">
exertions, he procured the liberation of an unfortunate lady, a native of England, who had flown to that country, though in a &s;tate of preg|nancy, in que&s;t of her hu&s;band; but had found, on her arrival, that he was no more; and who having been &s;eized with a temporary delirium at this intelligence, was now, though recovered, pining in horrible confinement, which mu&s;t have been perpetual, had not the &s;earching be|nevolence of Mr. Howard di&s;covered her wretchedne&s;s, and procured her relea&s;e; crowning all his generous exertions by having her conveyed to England, and affording her an annuity for her &s;upport. This anec|dote is not, however, in&s;erted here as indi&s;putable; being only adopted on the authority of a pamphlet, entitled <HI>Anecdotes of the Life and Cha|racter of John Howard, E&s;q. F. R. S.</HI> which the writer of the&s;e memoirs has detected in many other re&s;pects to be un&s;upported by truth.</P>
<P>When the precaution of building lazarettos in England was propo&s;ed (an object which Mr. Howard laboured with ince&s;&s;ant zeal to accompli&s;h), the principal objection was, that the nation could reap no adequate re|turns from the Turkey trade for the va&s;t expence attendant upon &s;uch a plan. But our traveller now made it appear, by his con&s;ultations with the members of the Levant Company, that the want of a lazaretto was the real cau&s;e of the ruin of our Turkey trade; for our ve&s;&s;els from the Levant being compelled, by act of parliament, to perform a tedious and expen&s;ive quarantine at Malta, and the ports of the Mediterranean, be|fore they are permitted to appear off the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, the Dutch have an opportunity of being before-hand with us, and under&s;elling us at our own markets; and, as their ve&s;&s;els perform &s;carce any quarantine, we are expo&s;ed to the continual danger of the plague, through their me|dium. This opinion was confirmed, in every particular, by &s;ome Engli&s;h merchants whom Mr. Howard con&s;ulted at Salonica.</P>
<P>From Con&s;tantinople Mr. H. at fir&s;t de&s;igned to travel by land to Vienna, as the journey might ea&s;ily be performed in twenty-four days, no quarantine being then performed at Semlin, on the confines of the em|peror's Hungarian dominions, where formerly travellers u&s;ed to be de|tained for that purpo&s;e. But, on further con&s;ideration, he determined to <HI>&s;eek</HI> an opportunity of performing quarantine <HI>him&s;elf</HI>. With this view, he &s;ubmitted to the inconveniencies of a &s;ea voyage to Venice, where lazarettos were fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, in order to obtain the be&s;t information, by performing the &s;tricte&s;t quarantine, he returned to Smyr|na, and took his pa&s;&s;age in a &s;hip with a <HI>foul</HI> bill; thus running him&s;elf into the very jaws of danger, that he might be enabled to re&s;cue others from its fangs. This voyage from Smyrna to Venice was both tedious and dangerous, and la&s;ted 60 days; part of which time was con&s;umed by the avaricious delays of the captain, who lo&s;t the fair wind, by improperly
<PB N="26" REF="35">
tarrying at the i&s;le of Molita, near Dalmatia, and other places, for the purpo&s;es of traffic, and by the&s;e means expo&s;ed our humane voyager to all the fury of contrary winds, and of tempe&s;ts. Nor did the danger terminate here; for, a few days after leaving Modon, the ve&s;&s;el was at|tacked by a Tuni&s;ian privateer, and a very &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h en&s;ued; the captain determining, as the con&s;equence of being taken would be either immediate death, or perpetual &s;lavery at Tunis, that he would rather blow up the &s;hip than &s;urrender. But from this dreadful fate they were happily re&s;cued; for one of their cannon, charged with &s;pike-nails, hav|ing accidently done great execution, the privateer immediately hoi&s;ted its &s;ails, and made off; a circum&s;tance which the piety of Mr. Howard did not fail to a&s;cribe to the interpo&s;ition of Providence. At length, however, he arrived at Venice, and went thro' the nece&s;&s;ary forms of his quarantine, expo&s;ing him&s;elf to all the loath&s;ome inconveniencies of the place: for an account of which, together with the infectious &s;tate of his lodging in the lazaretto, and the methods he made u&s;e of to remedy the evil, &s;ee the IMPERIAL MAGAZINE for April 1789. It &s;hould be ob|&s;erved, that, in the cour&s;e of this journey, he al&s;o re-vi&s;ited the pri&s;ons, ho&s;pitals, and galleys in Holland; at Lyons, Avignon, Toulon, &amp;c. in France; at Nice, Savona, Salonica, Genoa, Leghorn, Pi&s;a, Florence, Rome, and Naples, in Italy; at Malta, in Venice, and in many parts of Germany. In the cour&s;e of his ob&s;ervations on this occa&s;ion, he had the &s;atisfaction, particularly at Lyons, to &s;ee that the attention he had paid to the &s;ubject had procured many humane regulations for the better &s;e|curity of &s;ome of the rights of nature to the mo&s;t wretched of her chil|dren. At Malta, having a letter of introduction to the Grand-ma&s;ter from Sir William Hamilton, which he pre&s;ented after his fir&s;t vi&s;it to the ho&s;pitals there, he was received with great kindne&s;s. His highne&s;s readily a&s;&s;ured him, that the pri&s;ons and ho&s;pitals &s;hould be all opened to his in&s;pections. On a &s;ub&s;equent vi&s;it, being a&s;ked by the Grand|ma&s;ter his opinion of the ho&s;pitals, he faithfully told him his &s;entiments, and made his remarks on what appeared to him improper; adding, that if his highne&s;s would him&s;elf &s;ometimes walk over them, many abu&s;es would be corrected. The&s;e animadver&s;ions were, it &s;eems, reckoned too bold; but Mr. Howard was not in the habit of looking upon princes and potentates with any great degree of adulation, or &s;hewing to them any particular portion of complacent deference; he therefore frequently repeated his vi&s;its to the&s;e places, more inclined to be plea&s;ed with the good effects of his &s;olicitude, and the plea&s;ure they imparted to the patients, than to retract any part of that Briti&s;h freedom of &s;peech which was found to be &s;o unharmonious to his highne&s;s's ear. This indiffe|rence with which he looked upon per&s;ons in power, &s;eems to have been a
<PB N="27" REF="36">
&s;triking trait in his character; his di&s;like to all the forms made u&s;e of on approaching royalty was &s;o rooted, that he is believed never to have bent the knee to any one; and, when unable to re&s;i&s;t the pre&s;&s;ing invitation to the table of the late Emperor of Germany, he carried the &s;implicity, or, as &s;ome will perhaps call it, the eccentricity of his cha|racter to the royal banquet, and would not depart from the temperate rule to which he had for &s;ome time adhered, of eating no animal food, and drinking nothing but water.</P>
<P>During the time that Mr. Howard was thus exerting his benevolence on the continent, his country was not unmindful of the &s;plendor which his virtues reflected on the Briti&s;h character: while the fir&s;t geniu&s;es of the nation were celebrating his worth with all the ardour of admiration, many patriotic characters &s;et on foot a &s;ub&s;cription for the purpo&s;e of erecting a &s;tatue or column to his memory; and, in the cour&s;e of con&s;i|derably le&s;s than a year and a half, between fifteen and &s;ixteen hundred pounds were &s;ub&s;cribed. But our philanthropi&s;t was far from receiving, from this proceeding, the &s;atisfaction it was de&s;igned to impart. His letters to his private friends &s;ufficiently &s;hew how much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed he felt his mind on this occa&s;ion: "Have not I one friend in England," &s;aid he, "that would put a &s;top to &s;uch a proceeding?" And in another letter, addre&s;&s;ed to a very amiable character, who had no incon&s;iderable &s;hare in forming his youthful mind to benevolence and virtue, he ex|pre&s;&s;es the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction at finding that his particular friends were &s;o well acquainted with his &s;entiments, that, in the whole li&s;t of &s;ub|&s;cribers, he had not met with the name of one of them. To put an ef|fectual &s;top to this proceeding, Mr. Howard, on the 15th December, wrote from Vienna the following letter to the &s;ub&s;cribers:

<P>The de&s;ign was therefore accordingly laid a&s;ide; and the &s;ub&s;cribers were publicly invited either to recal their &s;ub&s;criptions, or leave them to the di&s;po&s;al of the committee. Out of the &s;um not recalled, 200l. was, in the &s;ame year, applied to the relief of 55 pri&s;oners and their fa|milies in the metropolis: upwards of 750l. &s;till remain undi&s;po&s;ed of in the hands of the committee.</P>
<P>Thus did the hero of benevolence, with more than ancient &s;implicity, refu&s;e the triumphal laurel which gratitude and admiration had prepared for his brow, even at the very time when his re&s;tle&s;s mind was planning fre&s;h victories over barbarity and prejudice, and preparing to bear &s;till farther the pious banner of humanity and moral reformation. Ever &s;teady to the great objects of his life, he con&s;umed this and the following year in making a thorough progre&s;s through all the counties and divi&s;ions of Scotland, of Ireland, of England, and of Wales, vi&s;iting indi&s;criminately pri&s;ons, ho&s;pitals, public charities, and &s;eminaries of education; in &s;hort, every place (in the metropolis, or the provinces, in cities, or in villages) where mi&s;ery might be &s;u&s;pected to be found brooding over her fate, or reformation might be needed to &s;ecure the future health and morals of mankind: nor did he on &s;uch occa&s;ions &s;uffer the minute&s;t circum&s;tances, either in the deportment, the accommodations, the food, or the raiment of the pri&s;oners, the paupers, or others, to e&s;cape his ob&s;ervation. The toil and a&s;&s;iduity of this, his la&s;t progre&s;s, through the Briti&s;h dominions were not without their reward. He had the &s;atisfaction, before he bade a la&s;t farewel to his native land, who&s;e real happine&s;s he had &s;o anxiou&s;ly
<PB REF="38">
laboured to promote, of &s;eeing that all his labours had not been fruitle&s;s; but that he had occa&s;ioned &s;ome regulations to take place, which piety will not hear of without a glow of rapture, or humanity behold with|out dropping the joyful tear. "It gave me &s;incere plea&s;ure," &s;ays this amiable man, "to find that, from the attention of the magi|&s;trates, and the operation of the &s;alutary act for pre&s;erving the health of pri&s;oners, the gaols of the capital, though crowded, have been freed from that di&s;ea&s;e which formerly de&s;troyed more per&s;ons than the hand of the executioner: and tho&s;e in the country have been &s;o much improved, that mo&s;t of them may now be vi&s;ited without hazard of infection. With &s;atisfaction I have al&s;o ob&s;erved the <HI>liberal</HI> and <HI>hu|mane</HI> &s;pirit which engages the public to alleviate the &s;ufferings of pri|&s;oners in general, and particularly to relea&s;e many <HI>indu&s;trious</HI>, though <HI>unfortunate</HI> debtors." Thus does the mode&s;t &s;implicity of the philan|thropi&s;t mention the good effects of his own indefatigable labours, without alluding to his own efforts, and generou&s;ly a&s;cribe to others the merit of tho&s;e improvements of which him&s;elf had been the effi|cient cau&s;e. Yes, thou tran&s;cendant worthy! thine was the breath which revived in Briti&s;h hearts the too much neglected embers of hu|manity; and may the humble admiration which now labours to di&s;&s;e|minate the knowledge of thy virtues, contribute in &s;ome degree to keep alive the generous flame&mdash;a flame which, fed by the philanthro|py of Howard, could warm even the rugged brea&s;ts of tho&s;e who were hitherto tyrants by pre&s;cription, and obdurate by profe&s;&s;ion! This was particularly con&s;picuous at Che&s;ter, Liverpool, Oxford Ca&s;tle, and other pri&s;ons, where more humane and tender modes of treatment had been adopted, and where Mr. Howard, conver&s;ing with the <HI>gaolers</HI> on the good effects which &s;teady, lenient, and per&s;ua&s;ive methods might produce, &s;ome of the keepers &s;aid, "they <HI>now</HI> find they can do more with their pri&s;oners by lenient mea&s;ures, than with a r$ugh hand."</P>
<P>Still, however, he lamented that the &s;pirit of improvement &s;carcely extended to "the more <HI>important</HI> object, the <HI>reformation of morals</HI> in our pri&s;ons. In this further reformation," &s;ays the philanthropi&s;t, "it will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to begin with the capital; for, as in my former vi&s;its, when I have met with the gaol-fever in county pri|&s;ons, I have been almo&s;t con&s;tantly told, that it was derived from tho&s;e in London; &s;o the corruption of manners al&s;o, flowing from that great fountain, &s;preads far and wide its malignant &s;treams. In what pri&s;on in London is there a proper &s;eparation of criminals, the old from the young, convicts from the untried? Where are the night-rooms
<PB N="30" REF="39">
for &s;olitary confinement and reflection? Where is any proper attention paid to &s;ick and dying pri&s;oners? Where are the rules and orders of magi&s;trates for the direction of gaolers, and the government of pri&s;oners? In what gaol are not the ears &s;hocked with the profane|ne&s;s both of pri&s;oners and turnkeys? Where is any regard paid to the Lord's day? Where is not the afternoon of that day a time of greater intercour&s;e of vi&s;itants than any other? And though the gaol|ers taps are aboli&s;hed, yet are not the publicans continually waiting to &s;erve the pri&s;oners, and their company? Is not beer <HI>now</HI> &s;old by the debtors? And do not turnkeys keep &s;hops in the gaols?"</P>
<P>The above pa&s;&s;age is quoted thus at large from Mr. Howard's la&s;t publication, becau&s;e it tends to di&s;play many of the objects princi|pally kept in view in all his projects for the reformation of our pri|&s;ons: other articles of his attention, we are happy to &s;ay, &s;tand re|corded in the comparative decency and healthine&s;s of many of the&s;e receptacles for vice and mi&s;ery, both in and out of the metropolis, and in the &s;uperior attention which is paid to the rights of humanity. Our philanthropi&s;t had al&s;o &s;till to lament the cruel &s;everity of our laws, and the very inadequate offences for which per&s;ons were doomed to re&s;ign the precious inheritance of life, or to linger out exi&s;tence in mi&s;ery and confinement: nay, he could not but behold with indigna|tion how, in this land of freedom and boa&s;ted equity, oppre&s;&s;ion may &s;till pervert the law to the privation even of the liberty of injured in|nocence. In the county gaol of Cumberland at Carli&s;le, in particular, he found a pri&s;oner, who, as the widow of an old gentleman, had en|joyed an e&s;tate of 300l. per annum, and about 7000l. in mortgages; but marrying afterwards in Scotland to a Mr. Melbourn of Carli&s;le, he &s;oon &s;quandered 4 out of the 7,000l. and &s;he (in con&s;equence of &s;ome di&s;agreement) refu&s;ing to give up the mortgages for the other 3000, he, under &s;ome pretence, by an attachment from the court of chancery, &s;ent her to the common gaol; which confinement pre|vented her compliance with an order for appearance at that court <HI>in</HI> 15 <HI>days of St. Hilary next en&s;uing</HI>. At fir&s;t &s;he was on the ma&s;ter's &s;ide; but the gaoler, after cruelly &s;eizing her clothes, &amp;c. for the rent of her apartment, turned her on the common &s;ide, to a little mi&s;erable room without a fire-place. Not having the county allowance, this poor injured creature &s;upported her&s;elf by &s;pinning and knitting, and the occa&s;ional kindne&s;s of her <HI>late</HI> hu&s;band's relations, while her <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> hu&s;band lived and rioted on her e&s;tate, &s;ending her &s;ometimes, with the intermi&s;&s;ion of &s;even or eight months, the in&s;ulting charity of twenty &s;hillings. By her &s;pinning &s;he was not at fir&s;t capable of earn|ing
<PB N="31" REF="40">
more than <HI>four-pence a-week</HI>; but at length, by practice and ex|treme application, &s;he could, when in health, earn in that time about ten-pence.&mdash;O Humanity! art thou at a lo&s;s for objects on whom to &s;hine? enter the gloomy rece&s;&s;es of the pri&s;on, how many languid wretches &s;halt thou find full worthy of thy reviving beams!</P>
<P>Mr. Howard having thus furni&s;hed him&s;elf with &s;ufficient matter to throw con&s;iderable additional light upon tho&s;e &s;ubjects, which he ju&s;tly con&s;idered &s;o intimately connected with the morals, the welfare, and the happine&s;s of mankind, in 1789, publi&s;hed, in quarto, <HI>An account of the principal Lazarettos in Europe; with various papers relative to the Plague; together with further ob&s;ervations on &s;ome foreign pri&s;ons and ho&s;pitals; and additional remarks on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of tho&s;e in Great Britain and Ireland</HI>; embelli&s;hed with a great number of curious plates. To this work he affixed the following motto: "<HI>O let the &s;or|rowful &s;ighing of the pri&s;oners come before thee!</HI>" to the adoption of which, from the 12th ver&s;e of the 79th P&s;alm, he was led by ob|&s;erving, while he was attending divine &s;ervice one Sunday at Lanca&s;|ter, that the pri&s;oners of the ca&s;tle there were particularly affected by that pa&s;&s;age, as it was read in the p&s;alm for the day. This, his la&s;t publication, after pointing out the regulations nece&s;&s;ary to be adopted by the legi&s;lature, the philanthropi&s;t concludes with the following em|phatic and prophetic language: "After all, the be&s;t laws will fail in their effect, unle&s;s the a&s;&s;iduous and zealous endeavours of magi&s;trates be exerted in a &s;trict attention to their execution. Abu&s;es, tho' ever &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly guarded again&s;t, will creep in; and it requires the utmo&s;t vigilance to <HI>detect</HI>, and re&s;olution to <HI>reform</HI> them. If I have been able to point out any of the&s;e, and to &s;ugge&s;t their cau&s;es and remedies, it has been by that <HI>clo&s;e, per&s;evering</HI> attention to <HI>one</HI> object, which has in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upplied the want of original abilities, and gives me clear notions, and a more decided opinion upon the&s;e matters. To my country I commit the re&s;ult of my pa&s;t labours. It is my intention again to quit it, for the purpo&s;e of revi&s;iting Ru&s;&s;ia, Turkey, and &s;ome other countries, and extending my tour in the Ea&s;t. I am not in&s;en&s;ible of the dangers that mu&s;t attend &s;uch a journey: tru&s;ting, however, in the protection of that <HI>kind Providence</HI> which has hitherto pre&s;erved me, I <HI>c$mly</HI> and <HI>cheerfully</HI> commit my&s;elf to the di&s;po&s;al of unerring wi&s;dom. <HI>Should it plea&s;e God to cut off my life in the pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, let not my conduct be uncandidly imputed to ra&s;hne&s;s or enthu&s;ia&s;m, but to a &s;erious and deliberate conviction that I am pur&s;uing the path of duty; and to a &s;incere de&s;ire of being made an in&s;trument of more exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s
<PB N="32" REF="41">
to my fellow-creatures than could be expected in the narrow circle of re|tired life.</HI>"</P>
<P>Such were the &s;entiments with which this truly great and amiable character &s;ilenced all the objections and &s;olicitations of tho&s;e friends who would rain have di&s;&s;uaded him from his benevolent but dangerous de&s;ign;&mdash;&s;uch were the &s;entiments with which he once more bad fare|wel to that country, to who&s;e bourn he was never permitted to return. But though we are deprived of his future labours, though his du&s;t is not permitted to remingle with his native earth, nor Britons indulged in the mournful plea&s;ure of watering with their tears the &s;pot which entombs him, let us not forget that, in his excellent publications, he has left us a noble legacy, which furni&s;hes us with the means and the incitements to benevolence! and may tho&s;e who have power and op|portunity, con&s;ider the&s;e records of his pious and patriot labours as talents which it is their duty to improve, and for the application of which they mu&s;t be an&s;werable at the great day of account.</P>
<P>No particulars concerning this la&s;t journey of this <HI>be&s;t good man</HI> have yet tran&s;pired, but that, in his way to Cher&s;on, a new &s;ettlement of the Ru&s;&s;ians, in the mouth of the Dnieper, or Bory&s;thenes, to|wards the northern extremity of the Black Sea, where he died, his baggage was lo&s;t from behind his carriage, while him&s;elf and &s;er|vant were taking the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment of &s;lumber. This, how|ever, was recovered on his ha&s;tening back to the neare&s;t town, where he had &s;een a party of Ru&s;&s;ian recruits, who were the objects of his &s;u&s;picion. The things had been found by &s;ome ploughmen, half-buried in the &s;oil by the road &s;ide; but &s;u&s;picion &s;o &s;trongly fa&s;tened upon the recruits, that &s;even of them were con&s;igned by the magi&s;trates to exile in Siberia. Shortly after this, having vi&s;ited a young lady who had an epidemic fever, for the purpo&s;e of admini&s;tering that relief which he hoped his con&s;tant attention to the&s;e di&s;orders would enable him to &s;upply, he caught the infecti$n. Prince Potemkin, hearing of his ill|ne&s;s, &s;ent his phy&s;ician to attend him from Ja&s;&s;y: but medical aid was vain; and, after langui&s;hing about twelve days, he expired on the 20th of January 1790, at Cher&s;on, a victim to that benevolence which had been the con&s;tant and invariable object of his pur&s;uit, through many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years of his life. After having been kept five days, in pur&s;uance of his particular in&s;tructions to his &s;ervant, he was buried, according to his own de&s;ire, in the garden of a neighbouring villa, belonging to a French gentleman, from whom he had received great civilities. He was attended in his la&s;t hours by the &s;ame faithful &s;er|vant who had accompanied him in all his former travels, and whom he particularly in&s;tructed not to depart for England till five weeks
<PB N="33" REF="42">
after his decea&s;e. Other reports affirm the malignant fever to have been caught by vi&s;iting an ho&s;pital where the infection prevailed; but the ac|count given in the London Gazette is here followed; and it may be re|marked, that it is the fir&s;t in&s;tance of the death of a private indivi|dual being noticed in this national print.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard left Edward Leeds, E&s;q. Ma&s;ter in Chancery, and Jo&s;eph Leeds, E&s;q. of Croydon, Surrey (the brothers of his &s;econd wife), executors of his will.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the works already noticed in the cour&s;e of the&s;e memoirs, Mr. Howard publi&s;hed, in the year 1780, <HI>Hi&s;torical Remarks and Anec|dotes on the Ca&s;$ $he B$&s;tille, tran&s;lated from the French;</HI> and in the year 1789, <HI>the Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany's New Code of Criminal Laws, with an Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation</HI>. It was not with uninterrupted &s;ecurity that our philanthropi&s;t expo&s;ed the horrors of de&s;poti&s;m, and the cruel ini|quities of the now ruined Ba&s;tille. The jealous re&s;entment of the French police, had nearly doomed him to a participation of all the &s;ufferings of that dete&s;ted pri&s;on. From this danger he was, however, re&s;cued by the timely interpo&s;ition of our Amba&s;&s;ador. After this circum&s;tance, he is reported to have &s;tood &s;o much in dread of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, that in every per&s;on who, from admiration, thronged to look upon him, while in France, he fancied he beheld the de&s;perate ruffian preparing the dagger for his heart.</P>
<P>As a member of that great &s;ociety of which provinces and kingdoms may be con&s;idered as only humble divi&s;ions, and of which the bounda|ries are to be looked for only in tho&s;e barriers which &s;eparate this ter|re&s;trial &s;phere from the &s;i&s;ter globes which people the immen&s;ity of created &s;pace; the facts already &s;tated to the reader mu&s;t &s;peak Mr. Howard to &s;tand unequalled: and it is to be remembered that his feeling heart ex|tended its tender commi&s;eration in an equal degree, even to the brute creation. But whether as a private character, he was as amiable as he was admirable in his public conduct, has been que&s;tioned, perhaps, with more envy than propriety. It is natural enough to conclude, that a man who devoted his whole life to the arduous and undiver&s;ified pur&s;uit of one grand object, e&s;pecially if this pur&s;uit naturally &s;ubjected him to the contemplation of objects not very congenial with &s;entiments of elegance and refinement, would have &s;omething har&s;h and eccentric in his out|ward demeanor, and not be very much di&s;tingui&s;hed by tho&s;e &s;oft and engaging arts by which very &s;uperficial characters frequently in&s;inuate them&s;elves into our affections; and which, though not all concomitants of merit, are perhaps nece&s;&s;ary to endear even the mo&s;t &s;hining abilities, and the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed virtues: and that Mr. Howard &s;o far was deficient, it is not ea&s;y to deny, any more than it can
<PB N="34" REF="43">
ju&s;tly be concealed that there were, in particular circum&s;tances, rather too much au&s;terity and inflexibility in his di&s;po&s;ition: but the&s;e were only &s;light blemi&s;hes which would not have been ob&s;erved, if they had been a&s;&s;ociated with the common qualifications of the herd of mankind. It is the nature of whatever is brilliant, to make its defects the more con&s;picuous; and &s;pots, which appear dark upon the luminous face of the &s;un, might be thought beauties on the dull clod of uneradicated earth.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard, with all his excentricity, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very eminent de|gree of affability; and if he could not bend and fawn to greatne&s;s, or bring him&s;elf, in all things, to the exact &s;tandard of modern manners, he placed him&s;elf on a level with all mankind, and treated all with the &s;ame degree of civility and attention.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to religious &s;entiments, he has been charged of ri|gid illiberality: but if this were the ca&s;e, it is &s;omething extraordinary that it &s;hould never be apparent in action; and the very rever&s;e is prov|ed by the te&s;timony (among others) of Mr. Thickne&s;s, who affirms, that he "con&s;tantly built a cottage every year on his own e&s;tate, and put a poor family in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, on expre&s;s condition, that they &s;hould at|tend divine &s;ervice every Sunday, at <HI>church, ma&s;s, meeting</HI>, or <HI>&s;ynagogue</HI>." How far it is con&s;i&s;tent with illiberality to diffu&s;e its favours alike upon per&s;ons of all per&s;ua&s;ions, li&s;tening to no plea but that of their poverty, compliant at once to the prejudices of all, and anxious only that they &s;hould cultivate the meek &s;pirit of piety according to that particular &s;en|timent which had been inculcated into them; we leave common &s;en&s;e to determine: but the cruele&s;t a&s;per&s;ion on the character of Mr. Howard, is that which relates to his dome&s;tic conduct. The behaviour of this philanthropi&s;t, &s;o tender and humane to the wretched outca&s;ts of guilt and mi&s;ery is reported to have been &s;o &s;evere and unfeeling to his <HI>own</HI>, and <HI>beloved</HI> &s;on, as to have occa&s;ioned the derangement of his intellects.</P>
<P>That Mr. Howard, like many other parents, might have higher no|tions of paternal authority, than a thorough inve&s;tigation of the &s;ubject would ju&s;tify, cannot perhaps be denied; neither is it controverted&punc; that in his temper (as with prede&s;tinarians in general) there was too much of &s;ternne&s;s and &s;everity. But how unheard of mu&s;t have been that cru|elty which could produce &s;uch terror or angui&s;h to the mind of youth as to derange the rational &s;y&s;tem, and hurl the powers of rea&s;on from their &s;eat. Madne&s;s is &s;eldom, if ever, produced by any adventitious circum&s;tance without a pre-exi&s;tent and pre-di&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e: and not unfrequently, the con&s;titution has &s;o &s;trong and natural a bias to this derangement, that the common progre&s;s of events pu&s;hes the tottering rea&s;on from the brink of the precipice upon which it hovers into the inevi|table
<PB N="35" REF="44">
aby&s;s. When this is the ca&s;e, ignorance, incapable of di&s;covering the propelling &s;ource within, &s;eeks for &s;ome external cau&s;e to account for the dreadful effect; and malevolence &s;eldom fails to fa&s;ten upon &s;ome hypothe&s;is which may inflict fre&s;h angui&s;h on tho&s;e unhappy re|latives who are already but too far overwhelmed in angui&s;h and regret: but that the man, who&s;e liberal feelings and expan&s;ive &s;ympathy we have made this feeble attempt to pourtray, could have exerci&s;ed towards an only child, that brutality which would have driven to in&s;anity an undi&s;tempered intellect, however timid and irritable, is what malice perhaps may report, but we can never believe. Add to this, that Mr. Howard indi&s;putably entertained the mo&s;t tender and rooted affection for his child; that he always regarded him with a &s;olicitude truly paternal; and, as his private corre&s;pondence &s;ufficiently evinces, ever reflected upon his di&s;tre&s;&s;ing malady with the feelings of a tender and ardent affection. Another charge brought again&s;t Mr. Howard, is that of inflexible ob&s;tinacy&mdash;a charge, which is &s;upported on the manner in which he conducted him&s;elf on the di&s;pute, relative to the &s;ituation of the intended penitentiary hou&s;e. But this charge is, in fact, only applicable to tho&s;e who, with inferior knowledge upon the &s;ubject, oppo&s;e with &s;uch irrational per&s;everance the plan of one, who&s;e benevolent life had been employed in collecting &s;uch informa|tion as rendered him the fitte&s;t judge to decide &s;uch a controver&s;y. In the opinion Mr. Howard entertained, he was encouraged to per&s;e|vere by the coun&s;el of Dr. Fothergill, and confirmed by the dying words of SIR WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, at who&s;e in&s;tance he under|took the ta&s;k. "This great and good man, &s;ays Mr. Howard, Dr. Fothergill &s;aw ju&s;t before he died, to whom he then turned, and a&s;ked, <HI>what progre&s;s we had made in the penitentiary hou&s;es?</HI>" The Dr. an&s;wered, "that we had paid all po&s;&s;ible attention to the opinion of others re&s;pecting a &s;ituation, that we mu&s;t &s;oon be obliged to reque&s;t the opinion of our judges concerning it. <HI>Be firm in your own</HI>, was all he was able to &s;ay, as he &s;oon after departed for a better life." This account of the Judge's la&s;t conver&s;ation, I received in a letter from the Dr. in January 1780; as I was then attending the pre&s;s at Warring|ton. I &s;hall take the liberty to copy, <HI>verbatim</HI>, my immediate an&s;wer to that letter. "Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Black&s;tone</HI>'s dying words, <HI>be firm in your opinion</HI>, &s;eem to me the mo&s;t important direction for our conduct. We are fixed upon as the proper per&s;ons to determine upon a plan, &s;ituation, &amp;c. of a penitentiary hou&s;e; why then transfer the office to other per&s;ons, who&s;e &s;tation of life, and other engagements, mu&s;t render them very unfit for entering into &s;uch a matter? let us, when we meet, ab|&s;olutely fix upon one &s;ituation as the be&s;t of the whole, according to
<PB N="36" REF="45">
our ideas, and &s;pecify our rea&s;ons; let us &s;ubmit the approbation, or rejection of this one plan, to tho&s;e in whom the law has ve&s;ted &s;uch a power; but not give <HI>them</HI> the unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, or <HI>us</HI> the improper degradation of determining in our &s;tead, &amp;c." the rea&s;ons which &s;upported their preference were well weighed, and whoever takes the trouble to con&s;ider the affair, will readily allow on which &s;ide the ob|&s;tinacy lay. With re&s;pect to Mr. Howard's wi&s;h to prevent any li|quors, except water, milk, tea, and the like, from being introduced into pri&s;ons, no narrow-minded want of feeling will be attributable to him, when we reflect that it was his ardent wi&s;h that none but felons, and &s;windlers (<HI>who</HI>, he ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <HI>are felons)</HI> &s;hould be con&s;igned to the&s;e dreary abodes; and when we con&s;ider the dreadful effects of intoxication, a fatal attachment to which, in tho&s;e who are &s;unk in misfortune, &s;o frequently occa&s;ions him who went in to confinement a debtor, to come out a reprobate. The indignation, however, which he entertained again&s;t the abu&s;e of liquors, having been rou&s;ed by the circum&s;tance of his finding, in the King's-bench pri&s;on, a quaker, whom he was going to relea&s;e, in a &s;tate of intoxication, occa&s;ioned him to expre&s;s him&s;elf in a manner to the Duke of Richmond, and others in <HI>private conver&s;ation</HI>, which was repeated again with exaggera|tion in the Hou&s;e of Lords, much, though unju&s;tly, to the injury of his popularity. Mr. Howard has al&s;o been reported not to have been <HI>naturally</HI> generous. But what con&s;truction is to be put on this report, we leave to tho&s;e to con&s;ider who have read his life. That his gene|ro&s;ity (con&s;cious as he mu&s;t be, that a private fortune can never be adequate to every demand of pity) was converged to one point, is obvious; and it is likely, that he who pur&s;ued one object &s;o &s;teadily in his travels, that even the &s;olicitations of friend&s;hip could not induce him to turn out of his way to behold the man&s;ions of grandeur and clegance, al&s;o kept the ever &s;ympathi&s;ing eye of his charity &s;o con|&s;tantly fixed upon the &s;ame point, that he had neither the lei&s;ure, not the means to attend to other objects of di&s;tre&s;s. But a conduct like this rather evinces the &s;teadine&s;s of his judgment, than his want of <HI>native</HI> genero&s;ity. On the whole, Mr. Howard &s;eems to have been a character truly &s;ingular in every re&s;pect; and his eccentricity in trifling matters, mu&s;t be attributed to the extraordinary attention which he con&s;tantly paid to the rights of humanity, and the important intere&s;ts of morals and of &s;ociety. His virtues, as they will &s;oar above defamation, &s;o do they render panegyric unnece&s;&s;ary; and his under&s;tanding, though certainly inferior to his heart was &s;uch as his works will &s;ufficiently evince to have been re&s;pectable. He was of a middle &s;tature; his features were prominent, and much re&s;embled tho&s;e of the poet Gray.</P>

<HEAD>BIOGRAPHIA ADDENDA. [No. III.] BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</HEAD>
<P>WAS born at Bo&s;ton, in the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's, in the year 1705. His father was a Tallow-chandler in that city; where al&s;o he &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip to a Printer. While in this &s;ituation, his letters to Sir Hans Sloane &s;ufficiently evince the attachment he di&s;covered to &s;cience, and particularly to philo&s;ophical &s;ubjects. He early removed to Philadelphia, in con&s;equence, as has been &s;u&s;|pected, of &s;ome &s;atyrical productions which he had anonymou&s;ly pub|li&s;hed. Here, at fir&s;t, he was employed as a journeyman Printer; in which capacity he exhibited a great example of frugality and in|du&s;try. The&s;e virtues &s;oon enabled him to commence bu&s;ine&s;s for him&s;elf. He began with printing primers, and books for children, but at length purcha&s;ed the Penn&s;ylvania Gazette, the olde&s;t paper in that province. This paper, and an almanack he annually pub|li&s;hed, were the fir&s;t vehicles which made his talents known to the world. About this time al&s;o, he became acquainted with the cele|brated Whitfield, by publi&s;hing who&s;e Sermons, and collection of Hymns, he acquired &s;uch profit, as enabled him con&s;ider|ably to extend his bu&s;ine&s;s. While he was thus ri&s;ing, by appli|cation, to opulence, Mr. F. employed his lei&s;ure time in the &s;tudy of Natural Philo&s;ophy, and in acquiring the Latin and French lan|guages, both of which he attained after he had arrived to manhood. Philadelphia, during the &s;ame period, al&s;o became indebted to him for the projection of her fir&s;t public charities, as &s;he was afterwards for her library. In 1743, the Society for promoting u&s;eful Know|ledge in America, now known by the name of the <HI>American Philo&s;ophi|cal Society</HI>, was formed upon the model propo&s;ed by Mr. F. His un|common a&s;&s;iduity &s;till continued to increa&s;e his reputation and know|ledge in Experimental Philo&s;ophy, in which, it is &s;aid, he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Rev. Ebenezer Kinner&s;ley, Profe&s;&s;or of Oratory in the Col|lege of Philadelphia. Mr. F. was the fir&s;t who, ob&s;erving the power of unin&s;ulated points in drawing off the electricity from bodies at great di&s;tances, inferred, that a pointed metallic bar, if in&s;ulated at a con&s;iderable height in the air, would become electrical by com|munication from the clouds; and by pro&s;ecuting the experiment, a&s;|certained the identity of lightning, and the electric &s;park. He ma|nufactured
<PB N="38" REF="47">
a kite with a large &s;ilk handkerchief, and two cro&s;s &s;ticks, which being rai&s;ed, during a thunder &s;torm, in June 1752, and the end of the &s;tring tied to a &s;ilk &s;tring which he held, and a &s;mall key being fa&s;tened at the place of junction, he had at length the complete&s;t evidence of the theorem. After this, he erected an in&s;ulated iron rod, to draw the lightning into his hou&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of mak|ing experiments; and that he might lo&s;e no opportunity of that na|ture, he connected two bells with his apparatus, which gave notice by ringing whenever the rod was electrified. The&s;e in&s;ulated con|ductors have, in con&s;equence of the&s;e di&s;coveries, been of con&s;iderable benefit to mankind, by pre&s;erving many buildings from being in|jured or de&s;troyed by lightning. For &s;everal years, Mr. F. con|tinued deeply engaged in the&s;e electrical experiments, maintaining a corre&s;pondence with P. Colli&s;on, E&s;q. F. R. S. his letters to whom being publi&s;hed, were much admired in all parts of the globe. In April 1762, the Univer&s;ity of Oxford conferred upon him the hono|rary degree of L. D. many of the mo&s;t eminent men of the age about this time cultivating his friend&s;hip, and revering his name.</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin had pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life, before his oppo&s;i|tion to the <HI>proprietary</HI> government; and his endeavours to introduce a <HI>royal</HI> one, fir&s;t rendered him con&s;picuous as a politician. His &s;cheme for new regulations for managing the Po&s;t Offices, and en|crea&s;ing the Po&s;t Tax in America, procured him the place of joint Po&s;t-Ma&s;ter General of the Provinces; and obtaining a &s;eat in the A&s;&s;embly, and joining with Mr. Jo&s;eph Galloway again&s;t the pro|prietary intere&s;t, he was in 1764 appointed Agent to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Province (Penn&s;ylvania) at London: &s;oon after which, he was al&s;o nominated Agent for New Jer&s;ey, Virginia, and Geor|gia. The affair of the Stamp Act coming on, the Doctor found full employment in oppo&s;ing it, though there are &s;ome who a&s;&s;ert that he was the original projector of it. However this be, he did not cea&s;e his indefatigable exertions, till the obnoxious mea&s;ure was repealed. This repeal did not completely &s;ooth the Americans. Di&s;contents reiteratedly &s;pread among them, and Mr. Samuel Adams, a &s;uppo&s;ed agent of the Doctor, previous to the de&s;truction of the Tea at Bo&s;|ton, continued to di&s;&s;eminate the &s;pirit of freedom among them, till it &s;pread through all the Provinces from New Hamp&s;hire to Georgia. The part Dr. F. was &s;uppo&s;ed to have in the&s;e commotions, pro|curing his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from his office of Po&s;t-Ma&s;ter, he left London, and repaired to America with a firm and ardent zeal to &s;upport the cau&s;e of liberty.

<P>The re&s;olution of the Americans to a&s;&s;ert their liberties was now &s;ufficiently inflamed; but their want of money and &s;tores would have rendered all their re&s;olutions fruitle&s;s, had not the fertile brain of Dr. F &s;ugge&s;ted the plan of a continental paper currency. The fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion of three millions of dollars took place July 25, 1775; and before he left America, the latter end of 1776, upwards of twenty-one millions were expended. The Doctor is by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed, from the very fir&s;t of the &s;truggle, to have looked forward to the event of American Independence; and accordingly, when the important que&s;|tion was debated in Congre&s;s, he, as Repre&s;entative for Penn&s;ylva|nia, was one of the mo&s;t firm and re&s;olute advocates for that mea&s;ure, in which he was &s;o warmly &s;upported, that his opponents were ob|liged to yield, and the re&s;olution, in con&s;equence, was carried. To &s;upport this re&s;olution, he was &s;ent to France to negociate an al|liance with that kingdom. Having taken two Engli&s;h prizes in his way, he arrived at Nantz the 17th of December 1776, and &s;hort|ly after wrote &s;everal letters to Lord Stormont, the Engli&s;h Amba&s;|&s;ador, relative to the more humane treatment, and the exchange of pri&s;oners; to which he could obtain no other an&s;wer from his Lord|&s;hip, than that <HI>he received no letters from rebels, except when they came to a&s;k mercy:</HI> not recollecting that he who &s;huts his ears again&s;t the voice of humanity, is the mo&s;t <HI>unnatural rebel</HI>. During the Doctor's re&s;idence here, &s;everal American privateers were privately fitted out from the ports of France, greatly to the detriment of our merchan|dize. This produced a Remon&s;trance from the Briti&s;h Court; in con&s;equence of which the French Mini&s;ter affected a &s;hyne&s;s towards the American Agents. But the news of the &s;urrender of Gen. Bur|goyne and his army to Gen. Gates at Saratoga, October 17, 1777, &s;oon encouraged France to yield to the ardent de&s;ires of the people, and declare publicly in favour of the Americans. The treaties, which acknowledged the independence of the revolted provinces, were ac|cordingly

&s;igned at Paris January 30, 1778. The Sieur Girard was appointed Amba&s;&s;ador to the new States; but before his departure, the Doctor had planned a &s;cheme for &s;urpri&s;ing the Briti&s;h fleet and army at the Delaware, which, but for the interference of the winds and weather, the Count D'E&s;taing in all probability had executed. The infatuated attachment of the French to America, and parti|cularly to Franklin, is a&s;toni&s;hing; and the zeal with which they la|boured to prove that his family originated in their country, &s;peak unan&s;werably the affection with which the people revered him.&mdash;It was in this year that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty con&s;tituted the Royal Medical Society of France, of which the Doctor was made the fir&s;t foreign Member. For near nine years he continued as Plenipoten|tiary in France, admini&s;tering the mo&s;t efficacious &s;ervices to his country, not only as a re&s;ource in their difficulties, but by &s;up|porting their &s;pirits again&s;t apprehen&s;ion and wearine&s;s; and hav|ing thoroughly effected his favourite &s;cheme of independence, he re|turned to America in September 1785. On his arrival at Philadel|phia, the citizens appeared to vie with each other in exhibiting te&s;|timonies of their e&s;teem. The Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, the Faculty of the Univer&s;ity, and other &s;ocieties, pre&s;ented him with their affec|tionate addre&s;&s;es, and in October following, he was elected Gover|nor of the State of Penn&s;ylvania; in which office he continued till October 1788: when he a&s;&s;i&s;ted as Repre&s;entative of that Province, at the General Convocation called for new-modelling the Con&s;ti|tution. It &s;eems that he did not entirely approve of the Foedera|tion; but he gave it his concurrence, becau&s;e he conceived a general union nece&s;&s;ary, and thought a better plan was not likely to be de|vi&s;ed. This was his la&s;t interference in popular affairs; and full of years and honours, he &s;pent his remaining time in the pur&s;uit of his favourite &s;ciences, entertaining weekly, at his own hou&s;e, a Society for Political and Philo&s;ophical Inquiries. Several years before his death, he was afflicted with the gravel; and in the beginning of April, 1790, he was &s;eized with a feveri&s;h indi&s;po&s;ition, which ter|minated his life on the 17th, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.</P>
<P>As a genius, Dr. F. was more of a writer than a &s;peaker, and more of a philo&s;opher than either. In his conver&s;ation, he was af|fable, obliging, and facetious. A collection of his common &s;ayings would form an intellectual banquet: his letters to his friends were full of wit and in&s;truction; and it may be truly &s;aid of him, that in the &s;age he never lo&s;t &s;ight of the friend or companion.</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t &s;olid talents, and the mo&s;t &s;teady exertions, do not in&s;ure fame. A &s;udden effu&s;ion of genius, or a &s;ingle effort of in|vention, will often tran&s;mit a name through many generations, while, too frequently, a long life of u&s;eful and &s;teady exertions will be found hardly to pre&s;erve from oblivion the le&s;s fortunate adventurer: the blazing meteor, that vani&s;hes almo&s;t with the fir&s;t corru&s;cations of its radiance, infinitely more attracts the vulgar attention than all the beautiful luminaries, who&s;e ince&s;&s;ant revolutions adorn the planetary &s;phere.</P>
<P>BERNARD GATES, E&s;q. though more than three&s;core years de|voted to the &s;cience of Mu&s;ic, and half that time employed in the cultivation of ri&s;ing genius, would hardly have been now remember|ed, but for the eminence and gratitude of his pupils. This gen$le|man was a native of Holland (being born at the Hague April 23d, 1686), and came over with his father, a Page of the Back Stairs to King William, at the glorious Revolution. In 1697, he was ad|mitted one of the children of the Chapel under Dr. Blow, appointed Gentleman Extraordinary to the Queen in March 1697, and in July following &s;ucceeded Mr. Howell as Gentleman in Ordinary. In 1710-11, he held one of the Choir of lay places, We&s;tmin&s;ter, jointly with a Mr. G. Laye, and the next year &s;ucceeded to a full place. November 4, 1714, he was elected one of the Choir of Wind&s;or, but did not long &s;tay there, as he became a &s;upernumerary at St. Paul's Cathedral. September 1727, Mr. Gates &s;ucceeded Dr. Croft as Ma&s;ter of the Children of his Maje&s;ty's Chapel, and was appointed Tuner of the Regals. In 1731, he cheerfully contributed to the ri&s;ing &s;ame of Handel, while mo&s;t other of our Ma&s;ters invidiou&s;ly endeavoured to depreciate his merits, or vainly attempted to become his rivals. That immortal compo&s;er having &s;et the Oratorio of E&s;ther for the Duke of Chandos, it was this year repre&s;ented in action by the children of his Maje&s;ty's Chapel, at their Ma&s;ter's hou&s;e in James-&s;treet, We&s;tmin&s;ter; and afterwards repeated by the &s;ame performers, in a Sub&s;cription Concert, at the Crown and Anchor.

<P>Mr. Gates never di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a compo&s;er of eminence; but there is a little Duet by him, pre&s;erved and commended at the end of Dr. Nares's Vocal Duets, the character of which is elegant &s;implicity. But it is as a tutor that he principally demands the grate|ful remembrance of the admirers of his &s;cience. In this re&s;pect his life was u&s;eful in educating &s;everal of the fir&s;t mu&s;icians now living, who have &s;hewn a regard for his memory, in annually devoting a day to his commemoration, and the cultivation of friend&s;hip among them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>(No. V.) DR. THOMAS AUGUSTINE ARNE,</HEAD>
<P>WAS the &s;on of the political Uphol&s;terer &s;o much celebrated by Mr. Addi&s;on. Our mu&s;ician was born in the year 1710, and di&s;|covered an early attachment to mu&s;ic; for even while at Eton, where he was &s;ent for education, he u&s;ed, at every opportunity, to torment his &s;chool-fellows with the wretched mu&s;ic of a broken Engli&s;h flute. And when he came home, he contrived to &s;ecrete a &s;pinnet in his garret, on which, having muffled the &s;trings with a handkerchief, he u&s;ed to practi&s;e at nights, while the re&s;t of the family were a&s;leep. His father had determined to bring him up to the law, and actually articled him for three years to an Attorney; &s;till, however, this child of Apollo devoted every moment he could redeem to his fa|vourite &s;cience, and was &s;o a&s;&s;iduous in his application, not only to the &s;pinnet, but al&s;o to other in&s;truments, that before his father had the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch an attachment, he caught him one day at a friend's hou&s;e in the very act of playing the fir&s;t violin. From this time he procured his father's con&s;ent to make mu&s;ic his profe&s;&s;ion; and having obtained this licence, &s;oon bewitched the re&s;t of the fa|mily.
<PB N="43" REF="52">
His &s;i&s;ter and younger brother became popular &s;ingers; and the former afterwards a great actor in the walk of tragedy.</P>
<P>Mr. Arne's performance on the violin, for which he had received &s;ome in&s;tructions from Fe&s;tino, &s;oon recommended him to the ac|quaintance and friend&s;hip of the mo&s;t eminent Italian ma&s;ters re&s;iding among us; particularly Geminiani; and procured him the place of Leader of the Band at Drury-Lane Theatre, in which he continued &s;everal years. But the &s;ame of his performance was &s;oon forgot, in the applau&s;e he received as a compo&s;er. His fir&s;t compo&s;ition was the mu&s;ic in the Opera of Ro&s;amond, which, though it contained &s;ome agreeable airs, was not very popular. Alfred, compo&s;ed in honour of the Prince&s;s of Brun&s;wick, and the Burletta of Tom Thumb, had better &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;eem to have particularly attracted the notice of the Prince of Wales and his Court. But in 1738, Mr. Arne com|pletely e&s;tabli&s;hed his reputation as a lyric compo&s;er, by &s;etting <HI>Comus</HI>, as it had been altered for the &s;tage by Dr. Dalton.
<Q>&startq;In this Ma&s;que (&s;ays Dr. Burney) he introduced a light, airy, original, and plea&s;ing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Han|del, whom all Engli&s;h compo&s;ers hitherto had either pillaged or imitated. Indeed the melody of Arne at this time, and of his Vauxhall &s;ongs afterwards, forms an aera in Engli&s;h mu&s;ic; it was &s;o ea&s;y, natural, and agreeable to the whole kingdom, that it had an effect upon our national ta&s;te; and, till a more modern Italian &s;tyle was introduced, was the &s;tandard of all perfection at our the|&endq;atres and public $dens.</Q>
<HI>(Hi&s;t. Mu&s;ic, Vol. IV. p.</HI> 659.) In 1736, Mr. Arne had married Mi&s;s Cecilia Young, a popular &s;inger, and pupil of Geminiani. From 1742 to 1744 Mr. Arne and his lady took a trip to Ireland; during which time al&s;o Handel happened to be there. The next year he was appointed Compo&s;er to Vauxhall; and his little Pa&s;toral of Colin and Phoebe met with &s;uch applau&s;e, as to be encored every night for three months &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. About this time our Compo&s;er al&s;o applied him&s;elf to &s;tudy the more ab&s;tru&s;e parts of mu&s;ical &s;cience under the learned Dr. Pepu&s;ch, the oracle of that time. Arne's &s;ub&s;equent compo&s;itions were very numerous, and though, as might be expected, &s;everal of them were un&s;ucce&s;sful, from others he reaped much additional applau&s;e. But the mo&s;t fa|mous of all his &s;ecular compo&s;itions, was the Opera of Artaxerxes, of which different opinions have been entertained. Let us hear our Mu&s;ical Hi&s;torian.
<Q>&startq;In 1762, Arne quitted the former &s;tyle of me|lody, in which he had &s;o well &s;et Comus, and furni&s;hed Vauxhall, and the whole kingdom, with $uch &s;ongs as had improved and po|li&s;hed our national ta&s;te; and when he &s;et the bold tran&s;lation of
<PB N="44" REF="53">
Meta&s;ta&s;$o's Opera of <HI>Arta&s;cr&s;e [i. e.</HI> Artaxerxes, of which him|&s;elf was the tran&s;lator], he crowded the airs, particularly in the part of <HI>Mandane</HI> for Mi&s;s Brent, with all the Italian divi&s;ions and difficulties which had ever been heard at the Opera. This drama by the novelty of the mu&s;ic to Engli&s;h ears, with the talents of Ten|ducci, Peretti, and the Doctor's &s;cholar, Mi&s;s Brent, had very great &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;till continues to be repre&s;ented, whenever &s;ing|ers can be found who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ufficient abilities for its per|formance. But in &s;etting <HI>Artaxerxes</HI>, though the melody is le&s;s original than that of <HI>Comus</HI>, Arne had the merit of fir&s;t adapting many of the be&s;t pa&s;&s;ages of Italy, which all Europe admired, to our own language, and of incorporating them with his own pro|perty, and with what was &s;till in favour of former Engli&s;h com|&endq;po&s;ers.</Q>
<HI>(Burney's Hi&s;t. Mu&s;ic, Vol. IV. p.</HI> 673.) In the Oratorio &s;tyle, Dr. Arne (who had taken his Degree at Oxford in 1759) com|po&s;ed the <HI>Death of Abel, Judith</HI>, and <HI>Beauty and Virtue</HI>. In his &s;a|cred Choru&s;&s;es, though Dr. <HI>Burney</HI> &s;ays they "were much inferior to tho&s;e of Handel," yet to <HI>tho&s;e only</HI> can their inferiority be admitted; &s;ince they po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pirit and fire, which if Handel had not preceded and monopolized all the prai&s;e in that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, would doubtle&s;s have delighted and a&s;toni&s;hed every hearer. His Oratorio airs Dr. Burney him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es to be often "admirable." Our Author's la&s;t work was <HI>Caractacus</HI>, and is thought by no means infe|rior to any of the preceding. He likewi&s;e wrote &s;ome Harp&s;ichord mu&s;ic, but &s;uch improvements have been introduced in that line of writing &s;ince his time, that they mu&s;t appear now to great di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Dr. Arne was in per&s;on remarkably plain, which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, expo&s;ed him to the ridicule of wicked wits; but this &s;erved only as a &s;oil to his genius and abilitie.</P>
<P>The private lives of Mu&s;icians, and the Profe&s;&s;ors of other polite arts, will not always bear a &s;trict enquiry; the prominent features in the Doctor's character were a love of ea&s;e and gaiety, with an unbounded attachment to the fair &s;ex, which certainly contributed not a little to keep him all his life in contracted and embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances. He was educated in the principles of the Romi&s;h Church, in the com|munion of which he died, on the 5th of March, 1778.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not conclude the&s;e Memoirs, without ob&s;erving that Dr. Arne was not le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in the in&s;truction of vocal performers, than as a compo&s;er; the admirable Mi&s;s Brent is alone a &s;ufficient &s;upport to this a&s;&s;ertion. Dr. Arne likewi&s;e tried his genius in poetry, an be&s;ide tran&s;lating Arta&s;er&s;e, as above-mentioned, wrote The Guar|dian Outwitted, and The Ro&s;e, with &s;everal of his &s;ingle Ballads, there being at that time a great &s;carcity of good lyric writers.</P>

<HEAD>BIOGRAPHIA ADDENDA. [No. VI] JOHN HORNE TOOKE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>TO delineate the political character, and trace the conduct of a man who&s;e life has been &s;pent in a continued &s;eries of re&s;tle&s;s oppo|&s;ition, to the encroachments of tyranny, or to the growing in&s;olence of faction, are no ea&s;y ta&s;ks to execute with candour and impartiality, while the parties concerned are yet engaged on the theatre of public action, and the events to be recorded are fre&s;h in the memories of men, and con|nected with the ruling principles of exi&s;ting parties. The jaundiced eye of political prejudice will di&s;colour the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted proceed|ings on the one hand, while, on the other, the ardent gaze of enthu&s;ia&s;|tic admiration may, at times, impart its own lively vigour to the ob|jects of its contemplation, and di&s;cover, in mea&s;ures, who&s;e apparent object it applauds, a purity and &s;ublimity of di&s;intere&s;ted virtue, not en|tirely &s;upported by the dictates of the actor's heart. By the malignant influence of the former prejudice, the writer of this article is proud to &s;ay he is under no temptation of being mi&s;led; and he flatters him&s;elf, that his judgment is too unbia&s;&s;ed, and his heart too independent, to be deluded by the latter: tho&s;e, however, who entertain a different opi|nion, may a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves, that the bias (if any there is) ari&s;es not from any per&s;onal attachment to the man, but from an hone&s;t zeal for the cau&s;e in which he is &s;o warmly engaged. In the confidence, therefore, of having taken &s;ome pains to be impartially convinced, we pre&s;ume to trace, and deliver our &s;entiments upon, the conduct of a man, who, though he has been at times the idol, and at others the dete&s;tation of the populace, has, in our opinion, uniformly pur&s;ued one &s;teady and glo|rious object, in the pur&s;uit of which, as its accompli&s;hment alone can prop the tottering pile of Briti&s;h freedom, we hope to &s;ee him crowned with the mo&s;t triumphant &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>John Horne is the &s;on of an eminent poulterer, formerly an inhabitant of the metropolis, and being educated at St. John's College, Cambra$ge, obtained, early in life, the living of Brentford; though the cle$ a$ $o|fe&s;&s;ion was not that to which he fir&s;t directed his attention. As he$v$ m$ch admired for his eloquence in the pulpit, and joined to a &s;trong and pe|$etrating judgment, an inten&s;e application, and an exten&s;ive acquaint|ance with languages and &s;cience, he might, in all probability, have ad|vanced to much higher honours in the church; but his keen and ardent &s;pirit was not to be confined to dry &s;ubjects of theology, nor his laud|able ambition limited to the applau&s;es of a parochial congregation. The genius of the times in&s;pired, and, the po&s;ture of affairs &s;eemed to demand from men of talents and di&s;cernment, a more active kind of be|nevolence than could be di&s;played in repeating to a narrow circle the well-known duties of &s;ocial and relative affection. He, therefore, at an early period, began to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in the political world, and e$li&s;ting him&s;elf under the banners of Freedom, became the warm par|tizan of Mr. Wilkes, &s;o long as that &s;elfi&s;h, but eminently u&s;eful dema|gogue, pre&s;erved any decent appearance of di&s;intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m; and
<PB N="46" REF="55">
when, in defiance of the oppre&s;&s;ion and violence of the court, Mr. W. A. D. 1768, became a candidate for the county of Middle&s;ex, Mr. Horne mounted on hor&s;eback, and, without an a&s;&s;ociate, canva&s;&s;ed the whole county in his behalf, and was the principal mean of &s;ecuring his famous election: an obligation of which Mr. W. made a kind of tacit ac|knowledgment, by eagerly ha&s;tening through the crowd on the fir&s;t day of the late conte&s;t at We&s;tmin&s;ter, to give his vote, and wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to his once warm, and afterwards injured <HI>patron</HI>.</P>
<P>From the time Mr. H. performed this important &s;ervice for Mr. W. and eventually to the friends of liberty at large, no lukewarmne&s;s in the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> was ever di&s;covered. A con&s;tant attendant at all the public meetings of the County, he contributed, in no &s;mall degree, to keep alive and di&s;&s;eminate that flame of liberty which the overweening vio|lence of oppre&s;&s;ion had occa&s;ioned to bur&s;t forth; expre&s;&s;ing the hone&s;t zeal of his heart, in terms of &s;uch warmth, as even tho&s;e in who&s;e behalf they were &s;poken, did not afterwards &s;cruple to take a mean advantage of. On the&s;e occa&s;ions it was, that he fir&s;t began that bold and con&s;titutional attack on parliamentary corruption, which to this day he is &s;o &s;teadily pro&s;ecuting; and breathing then, as now, the &s;entiments of Independence, with all the energy of cla&s;&s;ical propriety, gave additional attractions to Patriot Virtue, by the force and eloquence with which he taught her or expre&s;s her feelings. Of this in particular, we may give the following in&s;tance, extracted from an addre&s;s moved by him, and unanimou&s;ly adopted, at a meeting of freeholders, on Friday the 30th of April, 1770, at the Mile-end A&s;&s;embly Room; after a &s;pirited and elaborate recapitulation of grievances, under which the nation had for a &s;eries of years been groaning, and many ju&s;t and indignant reflections on the reception former petitions had met with. "Your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervants have attacked our liberties in the mo&s;t vital part: they have torn away the very heart-&s;trings of the con|&s;titution, and have made tho&s;e men the in&s;truments of our de&s;truc|tion, whom the laws have appointed as the immediate guardians of our rights and liberties." Who does not perceive in this, the &s;ame bold, energetic &s;pirit which dictated the recent Petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons? and who may not, (if not unbia&s;&s;ed by preju|dice) &s;ee the &s;tamp of uniformity on the conduct of the man whom faction abu&s;ed as a model of incon&s;i&s;tent and de&s;igning incon&s;tancy? For though Corruption has &s;hifted, or rather extended the theatre of her ex|ertions, and from being confined to the cabinet, has become alike the in&s;trument of all parties, ought we not (con&s;cious as every man mu&s;t be of the undue influence exi&s;ting in our Hou&s;e of Commons) to admire the &s;teady Champion who pur&s;ues her &s;teps, and, repeating his blows, aims at the de&s;truction of an Hydra, already prepared to &s;wallow up all the &s;canty remnant of our ancient liberties. As we are now, by the &s;ubject of the Middle&s;ex Election, naturally led to reflect on the connexion for|merly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Me&s;&s;rs. Horne and Wilkes, we &s;hall, for the &s;ake of connection, tre&s;pa&s;s upon chronological order, and make a few remarks on the quarrel which afterwards aro&s;e between tho&s;e popular characters. We know there are &s;ome who, even to this day, condemn the conduct of Mr. Horne; and it is in the remembrance of many, that
<PB N="47" REF="56">
in the year 1771, while this quarrel was pending, Mr. Horne was pub|lickly burnt in effigy by the mobility of London. But the mad fury of a mob in behalf of their idolalized demagogue, is not at all times a te&s;t of truth. Let any man glance his eye but ever &s;o ca&s;ually over that controver&s;y; let them but con&s;ider the provocations and glaring conduct of Mr. Wilkes, and we believe two opinions can &s;carcely be entertained upon the &s;ubject. Be&s;ides, what did Mr. Horne more than detect and declare, what every body is at this time, we believe, cl$arly convinced to be the true character of this pretended Patriot. That Mr. W. (to whom we owe the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e diabolical and op|pre&s;&s;ive in&s;truments of tyranny, General Warrants) has been emi|nently u&s;eful to this country, we do not di&s;pute; but when he evidently aimed at making the genero&s;ity of the Public &s;ub&s;ervient to his rapa|city and extravagance; when he ab&s;olutely forbad the Society of the Bill of Rights to &s;ub&s;cribe to the relief of poor Bingley, who was &s;uffering per&s;ecution for the publication of W.'s own letter, and &s;ent his agents and Myrmydons to procure a re&s;olution, that nobody el&s;e &s;hould have any a&s;&s;i&s;tance till all his exorbitant wants were &s;atisfied; mu&s;t we not admire the man who braved all the fury of public per&s;ecution, to expo&s;e &s;uch complicated a&s;&s;urance and ingratitude, and prevent the con&s;equences which factious ambition, &s;upported by popular liberality and credulity, might otherwi&s;e have brought upon the nation. The part Mr. H. took came al&s;o with peculiar propriety from him, as he had been the fir&s;t and principal cau&s;e of founding the Bill of Rights Society; and was, therefore, particularly called upon to re&s;cue it from rapacious in&s;ult. And though, perhaps, it may be allowed that in &s;ome few in&s;tances he was tran&s;ported too far; yet the violence of the provocations, and the illiberality of his opponents, will be admitted as ample ju&s;tification in the eyes of all, who are not predetermined to condemn.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Horne was not exempted from per&s;ecutions from other quarters; his &s;pirited letters to Mr. On&s;low, Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, publi&s;hed in the Public Adverti&s;er, in July 1769, &s;ubjected him to a pro&s;ecution for a libel. This was tried April 6th, 1770, before Sir William Black&s;tone, and ably defended by the famous Serjeant Glynn, but was qua&s;hed, in con&s;equence of a defect in form of evidence, which was re&s;olutely contended between Serjeant Glynn, for the defendant, and Serjeant Leigh, on the part of the pro&s;ecution; but the Judge determined in favour of the former, advi&s;ing the latter, however, to move for a new trial, on the ground of a mi&s;take in law. This motion was accordingly made and granted, and a new trial was heard, Aug. 1, at Guildford, in Surrey; when, though the &s;pecial jury was not &s;ummoned to attend before eight o'clock, Lord Mansfield called on the cau&s;e at half pa&s;t &s;even, and filled up the places of the five ab&s;ent &s;pecial jurors with tale&s;men, a trick which &s;ome (perhaps not very ra&s;hly), may think looks not a little like packing a jury, e&s;pe|cially as &s;imilar practices were common at that time. In this new trial Mr. On&s;low introduced an additional charge for libellous words &s;poken by the defendant at a meeting of the Freeholders of Ep&s;om; and although Serjeant Glynn and Mr. Me&s;&s;ing ably expo&s;ed the impropriety of pro|&s;ecuting the con&s;tituent for expre&s;&s;ing his &s;entiments at a meeting ex|pre&s;sly
<PB N="48" REF="57">
called to con&s;ider the conduct, and give in&s;tructions to their re|pre&s;entati$es, and of puni&s;hing a man for interrogating a mini&s;ter on a report, already current, and thereby affording him an opportunity of clearing him&s;elf if innocent; and although Lord Mansfield him&s;elf ac|knowledged the in&s;ufficiency of the evidence re&s;pecting the Let|ters; yet the Jury gave a verdict again&s;t again&s;t Mr. H. with 400 <HI>l.</HI> da|mages: and this, too, according to the directions of Lord Mansfield; though it is a known maxim of our law, that no action for <HI>words</HI> will lie, unle&s;s &s;pecific damages are proved, which, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e was never attempted. On the&s;e grounds, a rule was moved for (Nov. 8,) in the Court of Common Pleas, to &s;hew cau&s;e why the verdict &s;hould not be &s;et a&s;ide, which was argued by Serjeant Glynn on the 26th; but the Judges deeming it a point of too much importance to authori&s;e a ha&s;ty deci&s;ion, the que&s;tion was adjourned over till next term; and, April 17, 1771, the Judges unanimou&s;ly declared, that no judgment could be given; and the verdict was &s;et a&s;ide.</P>
<P>In the mean while Mr. Horne became embroiled in the mo&s;t vexa|tious controver&s;y, in which the treachery and malevolence of a popular character, at who&s;e rapacity and duplicity he &s;corned to connive, could plunge an un&s;upported individual; and &s;o high did the current of po|pular fury flow in behalf of his adver&s;ary, that though our patriot regu|larly an&s;wered and obviated all the charges brought again&s;t him;&mdash;and though neither the haughty confidence of Mr. Wilkes conde&s;cended, nor the &s;harp and elegant, but unargumentative rhap&s;odies of Ju|nius were able to invalidate his charges of corruption again&s;t the de|magogue, Mr. H. was repaid by the hatred and in&s;ults of the people (as we before have noticed), in the year 1771, was burned in effigy.</P>
<P>A man, who&s;e public &s;pirit and conduct has made him a ho&s;t of ene|mies, and who yet re&s;olutely per&s;everes in the public cau&s;e, is never long exempted from per&s;ecution; and an opportunity accordingly of|fered in Feb. 1774, for Lord N. Mr. F. and the &s;ervile majority of the then Hou&s;e of Commons, to direct their uncon&s;titutional malevolence again&s;t Mr. Horne. On Tue&s;day 10th, Sir E. A&s;tley pre&s;ented a bill to ena|ble T. De Grey, E&s;q. to enclo&s;e &s;everal common lands and fields in Nor|folk. Mr. Sawbridge immediately pre&s;ented a petition from W. Tooke, E&s;q. in oppo&s;ition to this bill, &s;taring that Mr. D. G. had not given the u&s;ual notice to the inhabitants, and that the inclo&s;ure would be highly prejudicial to the petitioner. It was al&s;o argued, with great propriety, that to pa&s;s the bill, while the title to part of the grounds intended to be inclo&s;ed, was litigated between Mr. De Grey and Mr. T. would be an uprecedented indecency. The petition was, however, neglected, and the bill ordered to be read a &s;econd time. This uncandid preci|pitancy produced the next morning a bold attack upon the Speaker (Sir F. Norton) and the Hou&s;e of Commons, printed in the Public Adverti&s;er, and &s;igned, <HI>Strike&mdash;but bear</HI>; in con&s;equence of which Mr. Woodfall, the printer, was, on the 14th, had up to the bar of the Hou&s;e. Mr. W. in his defence, charged Mr. Horne with being the author. He was, however, committed to Newgate, and a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to Mr. H. to attend the Hou&s;e on Wedne&s;day the 16th; to which both verbally by the me&s;&s;enger, and by letter to the &s;ub&s;cribing clerk, he an&s;wered, that he &s;uppo&s;ed there mu&s;t be &s;ome mi&s;take, as there were many other John Hornes in the
<PB N="49" REF="58">
city; but that whenever the Hou&s;e &s;hould order <HI>him</HI> to attend, he &s;hould, with duteous &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, obey. On the 17th he was taken into cu&s;tody by a &s;erjeant at arms, and brought to the bar; but the evidence of Woodfall (who was an accomplice) being in&s;ufficient to criminate him, the &s;ubject was adjourned, and Mr. H. uncon&s;titutionally detained in cu&s;tody till further evidence could be &s;ought among the <HI>compo&s;itors</HI> and <HI>printer's devils</HI> of Mr. W.'s office; notwith&s;tanding the &s;ound legal objections of Mr. Dunning, and the animated eloquence of Mr. Burke, who endeavoured to &s;hame the Hou&s;e out of &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive a proceeding. When the&s;e new witne&s;&s;es were at length procured, and Mr. H. was a &s;econd time arraigned upon an individual charge, nothing however ap|peared again&s;t him; and he was reluctantly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the fangs of that de&s;poti&s;m which hoped to glut its rage in his per&s;ecution. But, even at the moment of acquittal, they &s;crupled not to condemn him to pay the fees of the Hou&s;e&mdash;though it had previou&s;ly been enacted, that no gaoler &s;hould demand fees of a pri&s;oner detained upon an accu&s;a|tion upon which he was not found guilty.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t indignation which Mr. H. had conceived and entertained again&s;t the mini&s;ter, who&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions were awakening the de&s;tructive flames of war in our American colonies, was not likely to be much appea&s;ed by the&s;e per&s;onal injuries; and the bloody and fatal affair at Lexington and Concord, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay, the 19th of April 1775, precipitating the. Americans into unavoidable rebel|lio$, he was &s;timulated in con&s;equence of a motion made in the Con&s;titu|tional Society, to in&s;ert an adverti&s;ement in the papers, for &s;ub&s;crip|tions to be applied to the relief of the widows, orphans, and aged parents, of the American fellow-&s;ubjects, <HI>murdered by the King's Troops</HI> in that affray; and afterwards another, thanking the per&s;ons who had &s;ub&s;cri|bed, and acknowledging the receipt of 50l. on that account. The&s;e adverti&s;ements, which he &s;igned with his name at length, and dated as from the Con&s;titutional Society, drew down a pro&s;ecution on the printers; and Feb. 11, 1777, three of them were fined in 100l. each, an information been previou&s;ly filed (June 27) again&s;t Mr. H. as the author. Mr. H. was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of this, than he waited on the Attorney General, and told him that he &s;hould not pay for a copy, but in&s;i&s;ted on its being read to him; after which he informed him that he &s;hould plead his own cau&s;e. This accordingly he did (July 4), and never was a more &s;pirited and eloquent di&s;play of con&s;titutional and rational argument than this trial pre&s;ents. The oppre&s;&s;ive inno|$ations of practice introduced by the Attorney General in the pro&s;e|cu$ions for this libel, the vindictive barbarity of the&s;e pro&s;ecutions in ge|neral, and the overbearing and erroneous conduct of the Judge on Mr. H's former trial (the remedying of which co&s;t him 200l.) are &s;trongly paint|ed in his introductory animadver&s;ions; and his defence, which la&s;ted fo$ hours, is one of the keene&s;t and able&s;t &s;pecimens of foren&s;ic elocu|tion in our language. He was however found GUILTY by the Jury: and yet &s;o little was he awed by the terror of the &s;entence which the Ju$ges held over his head, that he immediately republi&s;hed his Ma&s;&s;acre of Glenco, with the avowed de&s;ign of comparing that dete&s;table tran&s;|action with the affair at Lexington. On the 23d of November, Mr. H. (after having been twice before brought up for the &s;ame purpo&s;e,
<PB N="50" REF="59">
and twice urging forcible rea&s;ons in arre&s;t of judgment) received, the final &s;entence of the Court; which was to pay a fine of 200l. be impri|&s;oned for the &s;pace of twelve months, and afterwards find &s;ecurity him|&s;elf in 400l. and two &s;ureties in 200l. each for his good behaviour for two years: a rigorous &s;entence, which (if we con&s;ider the violent provocations given by a corrupt government, and the &s;ympathy almo&s;t univer&s;ally excited by the wrongs of our American brethren, at the time when the adverti&s;ement was written) has more the appearance of malignity and per&s;onal revenge, than of ju&s;tice and public con&s;ervation.</P>
<P>But the legal per&s;ecutions to which our undaunted champion of truth and liberty has been &s;ubjected, though of the mo&s;t public notoriety, are not the mo&s;t important circum&s;tances of his bu&s;y life. Steady from the fir&s;t moment of his political exi&s;tence to the pre&s;ent hour, in the grand objects of his pur&s;uit, the reformation of the Hou&s;e of Commons, freedom of election, equalization of repre&s;enta|tion, and the &s;hortening the duration of parliaments of Great-Britain, he has ever been active, by the mo&s;t re&s;olute and probable means, to ob|tain and &s;ecure tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings to the people, without which all other ble&s;&s;ings of our boa&s;ted con&s;titution mu&s;t &s;hortly become merely nominal, and the freedom of Britons mu&s;t expire beneath the accumulating rubbi&s;h of rotten boroughs, ari&s;tocratic barters, and mini&s;terial influence. And it is evident that to open to him&s;elf an opportunity to &s;trike an important blow towards the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e aims, and of claiming in &s;uch a manner as will force attention, the re&s;toration of part of the&s;e funda|mental rights, was his &s;ole object in oppo&s;ing <HI>a late bargain and &s;ale</HI> between the reigning factions of the day, and offering him&s;elf a candi|date for the city of We&s;tmin&s;ter. And we venture to prophe&s;y that, whatever may be the per&s;ecutions and calumny <HI>he</HI> may per&s;onally &s;uffer in the conte&s;t, whatever may be the power and malevolence of his ene|mies&mdash;whatever may be the a&s;&s;ociated intere&s;ts which may oppo&s;e him, and how incompetent &s;oever his individual efforts towards procuring the much wanted redre&s;s, may appear, in the eyes of tho&s;e who know not the virtues inherent in per&s;everance wedded with &s;uch powers of mind, that directly or indirectly he will, at lea&s;t, accompli&s;h <HI>&s;ome part</HI> of his de&s;ign. It is worthy of remark, that at many of the public meet|ings (particularly at the <HI>quintuple alliance</HI>) where parliamentary reformation has been the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, Mr. H. has fre|quently met with his grand antagoni&s;t, the <HI>arch mock patriot</HI> Mr. F. but never was able to extort any direct an&s;wer or opinion, upon a topic which every <HI>real</HI> friend to his country would nece&s;&s;arily make the fir&s;t object of his attention; and it was his eva&s;ion of this important point, which occa&s;ioned this once-boa&s;ted <HI>Man of the People</HI> to be &s;o completely $i&s;&s;ed off the hu&s;tings during the la&s;t election. A day or two after this, however, Mr. Sheridan came to town: and as by an <HI>unaccountable</HI> concurrence of events, the bludgeon-men at the &s;ame in&s;tant made their appearance, the knocking down of thirty or forty people, and the ab&s;olute murder of one, compelled the populace to re&s;train their indignation.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion. The nece&s;&s;ary limits of this arti|cle will not permit us to enumerate the various publications of the au|thor
<PB N="51" REF="60">
of <HI>the Diver&s;ions of Purley</HI>, which have appeared with and without his name: and many are too generally known to make it at this time requi&s;ite. But we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that a pamphlet of the latter de&s;cription, entitled <HI>Facts</HI>, had a very con&s;iderable effect in expo&s;ing the errors and enormities of Lord N.'s admini&s;tration, and by its very rapid and ex|ten&s;ive circulation, ha&s;tened, in no incon&s;iderable degree, the fall of that unpopular mini&s;ter. This pamphlet was written in con&s;equence of a con&s;ultation with the Marquis of Lan&s;down; but when it was fini&s;h|ed that nobleman altered his mind, and reque&s;ted that it might not be publi&s;hed. The author, however, bluntly replied, that &s;ince he had written the work, he never entertained a moment's doubt of its propriety, and his Lord&s;hip mu&s;t therefore excu&s;e his not complying with the re|que&s;t. The pamphlet was accordingly publi&s;hed; and the Marquis and the author have never &s;ince had any intercour&s;e together.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the bu&s;ine&s;s of the We&s;tmin&s;ter elec|tion, the facts relative to that tran&s;action being &s;o recent, and &s;o am|ply related in the Imperial Magazine for June and July. We &s;hall therefore here clo&s;e our brief &s;ketch of the public life of this patriot. by ob&s;erving, that &s;o far from being (as he has been repre&s;ented) at|tached to the licentious principles of the <HI>frantix</HI> patriots of a neigh|bouring kingdom, grown drunk with the unrectified &s;pirits of an half-prepared liberty, he was foremo&s;t to warn his countrymen from imitating practices we have no <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to adopt: witne&s;s his motion at the meeting for celebrating the anniver&s;ary of the French Revolution, where he was <HI>liberally</HI> hi&s;&s;ed for ri&s;ing to expre&s;s tho&s;e &s;entiments, which not a per&s;on pre&s;ent, when he had delivered them, could help approving.</P>
<P>Mr. H's original de&s;ign was to come to the bar, for which rea&s;on very early in life he entered him&s;elf a &s;tudent of the Temple; but having an early offer of the living of Brentford, he changed his mind, and took to the Church; though this profe&s;&s;ion was never congenial to his di&s;|po&s;ition, and he &s;pent much of his time on the Continent, leaving an able curate on his living. Nor was he very con&s;tant in the pulpit, even after his return: he therefore, when he found him&s;elf &s;o deeply involved in politics, turned his thoughts once more to the bar, and re&s;igning his gown about 1772, applied in the year 1779 to be called to the bar; but was rejected by a curious manoeavre of the offended powers. After this he made a &s;econd application, with no better &s;ucce&s;s, being rejected by the ca&s;ting voice of Mr. Bearcroft; whom a great law character (unable to forgive the &s;everity with which he had been treated&mdash;becau&s;e he knew that &s;everity to be de&s;erved), po&s;ted to the Temple-hall, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of preventing his admi&s;&s;ion, &s;kill, and per&s;e|verance.</P>
<P>Shortly after this, Mr. H. at the particular reque&s;t of W. Tooke E&s;q. who&s;e petition we formerly noticed, took the name of that gen|tleman by an act of parliament, and by that name is now principally known. This may be con&s;idered as a kind of adoption, and is certainly an evidence of friend&s;hip of which our patriot was not unworthy, &s;ince his exertions evidently &s;aved the e&s;tate from being &s;wallowed by the ar|tifices of law, at a time when the a&s;&s;ociated intere&s;ts of the C. J. de Grey,
<PB N="52" REF="61">
his Brother, and the Attorney General, intimidated all the bar from making proper exertions in behalf of ju&s;tice. Towards this effect, al&s;o, the libel for which Mr. H. was examined before the hou&s;e, eminently contributed, by drawing the attention of the public upon the &s;ubject, and thereby intimidating the Hou&s;e from proceeding with a Bill, which would have plundered the gentleman, who&s;e petition they &s;o &s;hamefully neglected, of his ju&s;t, though litigated, property. Nor did the affair end here; for Mr. Dod&s;well, in con&s;equence moved and carried &s;everal re&s;olutions now on the Journals of the Hou&s;e, to prevent, for the future, all &s;uch precipitate and infamous proceedings.</P>
<P>Mr. H. Tooke is, at this time, upwards of fifty; but, from his ex|cellent &s;tamina, is likely to live to pro&s;ecute, and &s;ee (we hope) the accompli&s;hment of his public-&s;pirited views. In his private deport|ment he is affable and facetious, and <HI>communicative</HI>&mdash;&s;o far as it inter|feres not with his public views and intentions. He is a warm friend, and an open enemy; zealous and well qualified to in&s;truct the inexpe|rienced; quick to di&s;cover, and eager to encourage merit; and, tho' a de&s;pi&s;er of &s;ervility and flattery, proud to bear in memory the &s;lighte&s;t efforts either of public or private friend&s;hip, and eager to return them with real kindne&s;&s;es. Of the powers of his mind, and the extent of his crudition, it would be pre&s;umption in the author of the&s;e pages to endeavour to give an adequate idea. As a lingui&s;t, a grammarian, and a critic, he &s;tands unrivalled. His writings on popular &s;ubjects are in the hands of every one who reads at all; and their force and accumen have been equally admired by the <HI>friends</HI>, and felt by the <HI>foes</HI>, of real liberty. His eloquence is clear, deliberate, keen, and &s;arca&s;tic: his periods are &s;hort and pithy; his &s;en&s;e compre&s;&s;ed, but per&s;picuous; his words are cho&s;en with the mo&s;t di&s;criminating nicety, and arranged with the utmo&s;t &s;implicity: every &s;entence is a volume, and (when he would be felt) every epithet is a dagger. Of his undaunted per&s;everance and fortitude, the foregoing narrative is &s;ufficiently de|&s;criptive; and the intrepidity with which, accompanied only by the con&s;table of the night, he &s;eized the murderers (one of whom for his gigantic figure, was ironically called Infant) who had headed the rioters at Brentford, even in the mid&s;t of their myrmidons at the Shake&s;peare Tavern, is a clear proof, that his per&s;onal courage is equal to his mental re&s;olution.</P>
<P>From the year 1768, when his individual exertions carried Mr. W's election for Middle&s;ex, after his mo&s;t decided rejection at London, to the pre&s;ent hour, one year and a half only, (during which time he wrote his Diver&s;ions of Purley) have pa&s;&s;ed unmarked by &s;ome popular &s;truggle, either of his per&s;on or his pen, in behalf of the rights and li|berties of his country. Of the applau&s;e due to this indefatigable in|du&s;try, faction and the bias of prejudice will undoubtedly at pre&s;ent occa&s;ion various opinions; but, for our part, we avow a principled conviction of the ju&s;tice of his &s;entiments, and the genuine influence of public virtue evident in his conduct: and though perhaps it may be ob|jected, that too much of the irritable has been in &s;ome in&s;tances di&s;|tingui&s;hable in his compo&s;ition, in our opinion, the provocations he has met with, and above all the temper and abu&s;es of the times, not only plead his excu&s;e, but &s;ub&s;tantiate his ju&s;tification.</P>

<HEAD>BIOGRAPHIA ADDENDA. [No. VII.] Mr. THOMAS PAINE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Thomas Paine was born at Thetford, in the county of Norfolk, on the 29th of January, 1737. His father, Jo|&s;eph Paine, was a &s;mall, but reputable farmer, of that &s;ect called Quakers, and who occa&s;ionally followed the trade of a &s;tay-maker. His mother's name was Frances Cocke; &s;he was the daughter of an attorney at Thetford, and a member of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church.</P>
<P>Young Paine was educated at the free-&s;chool of Thetford, chiefly at the expence of his mother's relations. While at this place, he was deemed a boy of con&s;iderable acutene&s;s, but of an un&s;ettled di&s;po&s;ition. His pur&s;uits, however, were directed rather to objects of utility than ornament. He was in&s;tructed princi|pally in reading, writing, and cyphering; and at the age of thir|teen he left &s;chool, in order to learn his father's trade, for which he never &s;hewed much inclination, though he worked at it &s;ix years.</P>
<P>In the year 1757, at the age of twenty-four, Mr. Paine came up to London, which he quitted the year following, for Dover, where he worked almo&s;t a twelvemonth with Mr. Grace, a re&s;pectable &s;tay-maker of that town.</P>
<P>In 1759 he e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf as a ma&s;ter &s;tay-maker at Sand|wich.&mdash;Here he became enamoured of a young woman, named Mary Lambert, the daughter of an exci&s;eman, who had been di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed for mi&s;conduct, and whom he married on the 27th of Sep|tember the &s;ame year. If we are to believe the voice of fame, his u&s;age of Mrs. Paine was far from being con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Rights of Humanity</HI>; but, as we wi&s;h not to throw out reflections upon any character without &s;ufficient grounds, we &s;hall leave the examination of this matter to future biographers. We may, how|ever, venture to &s;ay, that family embarra&s;&s;ments obliged Mr. Paine to remove to Margate; but his re&s;idence there was not of long duration. Having di&s;po&s;ed of his goods, he once more min|gled
<PB N="2" REF="63">
with the bu&s;y throng in the metropolis, and being de&s;irous of qualifying him&s;elf for the office of an exci&s;eman, a place which he wi&s;hed to obtain, he repaired, in July, 1761, to his father's hou&s;e, in order that he might pro&s;ecute in quiet privacy the great object of his future cour&s;e.</P>
<P>After fourteen months &s;tudy and application, Mr. Paine was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the exci&s;e in December 1762, by the intere&s;t of Mr. Cuck&s;edge, the recorder of Thetford. Soon after he was &s;ent as a &s;upernumerary to Grantham and in 1764, he was employed to watch the &s;mugglers of Alford, a town in Lincoln&s;hire, &s;ituated at the di&s;tance of twenty miles from Bo&s;ton, and of &s;ix from the &s;ea. How far his conduct in this &s;ituation was marked with pro|priety, we know not, but it is certain that in Augu&s;t, 1765, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine was now reduced to great di&s;tre&s;s; but the liberality of his friends enabled him to &s;ub&s;i&s;t with &s;ome comfort till the beginning of July, 1766, when he was re&s;tored to the exci&s;e. As mere re&s;toration, however, neither brought him pre&s;ent employ|ment, nor the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, he was obliged to enter into the &s;ervice of Mr. Noble, who kept a large academy in Leman-&s;treet, Goodman's-fields. Here he continued till Chri&s;tmas, 1766, when he quitted Mr. Noble, and went to live in the &s;ame capacity with Mr. Gardnor, the ma&s;ter of a reputable &s;chool at Ken&s;ington. With this gentleman he lived only three months; but whether he preached in Moorfields, and in various places of England after leaving Mr. Gardnor's &s;ervice, as &s;ome have pretended, we will not venture to determine.</P>
<P>In March, 1768, he was, after &s;ome delays, &s;ent to be an exci&s;e officer at Lewes, in Suffex, where he lodged with Mr. Samuel Olive, a tobacconi&s;t and &s;hop-keeper of that place. On the death of Mr. Olive, Mr. Paine opened the &s;hop in his own name as a grocer, and in 1771 married the daughter of his old landlord. A de&s;ign being formed about this time, by the exci&s;e officers throughout the kingdom, of applying to Parliament for a confi|deration of the &s;tate of their &s;alaries, a contribution was made for the common cau&s;e, and our author, we are told, engaged to draw up their ca&s;e, which made its appearance in 1772. This is an octavo pamphlet of about twenty pages, exclu&s;ive of the intro|duction, and is divided into two heads: <HI>The State of the Salary of
<PB N="4" REF="64">
the Officers of the Exci&s;e;</HI> and <HI>Thoughts on the Corruption ari&s;ing from the Poverty of Exci&s;e Officers</HI>. Four thou&s;and copies were printed by Mr. William Lee, of Lewes; but tho&s;e intended for the Mem|bers of Parliament were not all di&s;tributed. Mr. Paine, on this occa&s;ion, wrote al&s;o, as is &s;aid, <HI>A Letter concerning the Nottingham Officers</HI>, which was printed on a folio &s;heet; and likewi&s;e another letter enforcing his ca&s;e, on a folio page; but though our author exerted him&s;elf in London throughout the winter of 1773, all the&s;e efforts ended in no application to Parliament.</P>
<P>In the year 1774, misfortunes crowded fa&s;t upon him. Pecu|niary embarra&s;&s;ments once more obliged him to retire to &s;ome place of &s;helter, where be might be &s;ecured from the harpies of the law. Troubles &s;eldom come &s;ingle. As he kept a grocer's &s;hop, and dealt in exci&s;eable articles, &s;uch as tobacco, he was &s;u&s;pected of unfair practices. Whether there were any grounds for &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion, it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire, but in April, 1774, he was again di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice of government; and though he petitioned for re&s;toration, his application produced no effect.</P>
<P>On the 24th of May, 1774, Mr. Paine entered into articles of &s;eparation with his wife, and &s;oon after came up to London, where the late George Lewis Scott, E&s;q. a commi&s;&s;ioner of exci&s;e, recommended him &s;trongly to Dr. Franklin, as a per&s;on who could, at that epoch, be very u&s;eful in America. In con&s;equence of this introduction, our author embarked for that country, and arrived at Philadelphia in the winter of 1774, a few months before the battle of Lexington, which was fought in April the year fol|lowing.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine's fir&s;t employment in the new world, was that of being &s;hopman to Mr. Aitkin, a very indu&s;trious book&s;eller, in Philadelphia. After this, when foreign &s;upplies were &s;topped, he commenced chemi&s;t, and undertook, in November, 1775, to furni&s;h the Congre&s;s with &s;altpetre.</P>
<P>On the 10th of January, 1776, he publi&s;hed an octavo pamph|let, of &s;ixty pages, entitled <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI>, which was intended to &s;upport the mea&s;ures of Congre&s;s, and which was attacked by Dr. William Smith, Pre&s;ident of the College of Penn&s;ylvania, under the &s;ignature of Cato. In the Penn&s;ylvania Journal, for December the 19th, of the &s;ame year, he publi&s;hed the <HI>Cri&s;is</HI>, which was continued periodically, as the nece&s;&s;ity of affairs required, in
<PB N="4" REF="65">
order to animate the hopes of the Americans; and for the&s;e &s;er|vices, he was appointed &s;ecretary to the <HI>Committee of Congre&s;s for Foreign Affairs</HI>, by which he enjoyed the corre&s;pondence of the celebrated Dr. Franklin. Having, however, through the channel of a new&s;paper, di&s;clo&s;ed &s;ome matters re&s;pecting the intrigues of the French Court, which he confidentially knew from foreign corre&s;pondence, the Sieur Gerard complained to the Congre&s;s, and Mr. Paine, finding that his conduct had greatly offended that body, gave in his re&s;ignation on the 8th of February, 1779. On the 16th of the &s;ame month, a motion was made in Congre&s;s for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him from an office which he no longer held; and though there were fourteen members for it to thirteen again&s;t it, the mo|tion was lo&s;t, there being a tye upon the States who alone could vote of five to five.</P>
<P>Soon after this, Mr. Paine was made Ma&s;ter of Arts by the Univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, and when the <HI>American Philo&s;ophical Society</HI> was revived by the legi&s;lature of that province, in 1780, he was cho&s;en a member, and had the &s;atisfaction of &s;igning the act of revival, as clerk of the General A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>In 1782, when the Abb&egrave; Raynal had publi&s;hed his <HI>Hi&s;tory of the American Revolution</HI>, Mr. Paine addre&s;&s;ed a letter to him on the &s;ubject of that pamphlet, On the 29th of October, 1782, he addre&s;&s;ed <HI>A Letter to the Earl of Shelburne</HI>, re&s;pecting an a&s;&s;ertion made by him in the Hou&s;e of Lords,
<Q>&startq;That when Great Britain &s;hould acknowledge American independence, the &s;un of Bri|&endq;tain's glory would &s;et for ever-</Q>
&mdash;And on the 19th of April, 1783, the &s;ame day that a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities took place, he publi&s;hed his la&s;t Cri&s;is, which was &s;oon printed as a pamphlet, under the title of <HI>Paine's Thoughts on the Peace</HI>. On account of the&s;e, and his other exertions in behalf of the United States, New York conferred on him &s;ome forfeited lands at New Ro|chelle and Penn&s;ylvania gave him a pre&s;ent of five hundred pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Maryland Journal, dated December 31&s;t, 1784, there appeared the follow|ing article: "On the 6th in&s;tant, his Excellency John Dicken&s;on, Pre&s;ident of the State of Penn&s;ylvania, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the A&s;&s;embly, re&s;pecting Mr. Thomas Paine, the author of Common Sen&s;e, and other political pieces, &s;trongly recom|mending to their notice his &s;ervices and &s;ituation, and concluding in the &s;ub&s;equent words: We confide that you will then feel that the attention of Penn&s;ylvania is drawn towards Mr. Paine, by motives equally grateful to the human heart, and re|putable to the public; and that you will join with us in opinion, that a &s;uitable acknowledgment of his eminent &s;ervices, and a proper provi&s;ion for the continu|ance of them in an independent manner, &s;hould be made a part of this &s;tate."</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="66">As his pen was no longer of much u&s;e to the United States, our author left America, &s;et &s;ail for France in the autumn of 1786, and arrived at Paris in the beginning of the year following, car|rying with him the model of a bridge, which was &s;hewn to the Academy of Sciences. From Paris he came over to England in September, 1787, thirteen years after his fir&s;t departure for Phila|delphia, and before the end of the year he publi&s;hed his <HI>Pro&s;pects on the Rubicon</HI>; or, <HI>An Inve&s;tigation into the Cau&s;es and Con&s;equences of the Politics to be agitated at the meeting of Parliament</HI>. This is an octavo tract, of &s;ixty eight pages, which treats of the &s;tate of the nation.</P>
<P>During 1788, Mr. Paine was chiefly occupied in the con&s;truc|tion of his bridge. For this end he made a journey to Rother|ham, in York&s;hire, in order to &s;uperintend the ca&s;ting of the iron by the ingenious Mr. Walker. It was erected chiefly at the charge of that re&s;pectable citizen, but the project had co&s;t our author a large &s;um, which was mo&s;tly furni&s;hed by Mr. White|&s;ide, the American merchant. This bridge of ca&s;t iron is one hundred and ten feet in the &s;pan, five feet from the &s;pring, twen|ty-two feet in breadth, and &s;till is, or lately was, exhibited pub|licly at Paddington for a &s;hilling.</P>
<P>Mr. White&s;ide becoming a bankrupt, the a&s;&s;ignees, who found &s;ix hundred and twenty pounds charged again&s;t our author, cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted at the White Bear, Piccadilly, in October, 1789. From the White Bear he was carried to the hou&s;e of Mr. Arm|&s;trong, in Carey-&s;treet, where he was confined for three weeks. He now applied to Me&s;&s;rs. Clegget and Murdock, two re&s;pectable American merchants, who became his bail; and upon his paying down four hundred and &s;ixty pounds, and giving his note for one hundred and &s;ixty more, he was &s;et at liberty in November fol|lowing.</P>
<P>When the appearance of Mr. Burke's <HI>Thoughts on the French Revolution</HI> excited the attention of the public, and called forth an ho&s;t of antagoni&s;ts, Mr. Paine entered the li&s;ts al&s;o, and produced his celebrated pamphlet, entitled the <HI>Rights of Man</HI>. This work
<PB N="$" REF="67">
being &s;ubmitted to the revi&s;al of Mr. Brand Hollis, was printed in February la&s;t, for Mr. J. John&s;on, in St. Paul's Church-yard; but as it contained many &s;trong things again&s;t the Briti&s;h govern|ment, that re&s;pectable book&s;eller, by the advice of his friends, declined to &s;ell it. A few copies of it, however, in its original &s;tate, were privately di&s;per&s;ed, and after being again &s;ubjected to a thorough revi&s;ion and amputation, it was publi&s;hed in March following, by J. S. Jordan, in Fleet-&s;treet. Without entering into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the author's political principles, we are free to confe&s;s, that this pamphlet di&s;plays great &s;trength of intellect, and however we may di&s;&s;ent from many things advanced in it, we cannot help thinking it entitled to a con&s;iderable degree of prai&s;e. Had Mr. Paine been le&s;s violent, its effects might have been much greater; but by the manner in which he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, and particularly with regard to monarchial government, it appears to us that he has materially injured the cau&s;e which he meant to &s;erve.</P>
<P>In the month of May la&s;t, Mr. Paine went over to France, from which he returned a &s;hort time before the celebration of the French Revolution at the Crown and Anchor. But whatever may have been the cau&s;e, he was not pre&s;ent among the company who were a&s;&s;embled upon that occa&s;ion. He has, however, under|taken the defence of republicani&s;m, his attachment to which &s;eems immutably fixed, and has thrown out a challenge to the Abb&egrave; Seyes, to controvert his principles if he can. His letter to the Abb&egrave;, dated Paris, July 8th, 1791, is as follows:
<LETTER>
<P>"During my preparations for a journey to England, I read in the <HI>Moniteur</HI> of Wedne&s;day la&s;t a letter, in which you give to all true Republicans a challenge on the &s;ubject of Government, and offer your&s;elf for the defence of what is called a monarchic opi|nion again&s;t the republican &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>"I accept your challenge with plea&s;ure, and have &s;uch confi|dence in the &s;uperiority of the republican &s;y&s;tem, over that nul|lity of a &s;y&s;tem called monarchy, that I engage my&s;elf not to ex|ceed the extent of fifty pages in my part of the controver&s;y, though I leave to you the liberty of taking whatever latitude you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>"My re&s;pect for your moral and literary character will be a &s;ufficient a&s;&s;urance to you for my candour in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; but
<PB N="7" REF="68">
though I propo&s;e to conduct my&s;elf in it with as much &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s as good faith, I ought to mention, that I do not preclude my&s;elf from the liberty of ridiculing as they de&s;erve, any monar|chial ab&s;urdities which may occa&s;ionally pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my mind.</P>
<P>"I do not mean by republicani&s;m, that which bears the name in Holland, or in &s;ome Italian &s;tates. I con&s;ider it &s;imply as a government by repre&s;entation, a government founded upon the principles of the "Declaration of Rights;" principles with which many parts of the French con&s;titution are at variance. The French and the American Declaration of Rights are but one and the &s;ame thing in principles, and almo&s;t in expre&s;&s;ions; and this is the republicani&s;m which I undertake to defend, again&s;t what is called monarchy and ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>"I ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure, that we are already agreed upon one point&mdash;<HI>the extreme danger of a civil li&s;t of thirty millions</HI>. I cannot conceive the rea&s;on why one part of the government &s;hould be &s;upported with &s;uch extravagant profu&s;ion, while the other re|ceives &s;carcely &s;ufficient for its plaine&s;t wants.</P>
<P>"This di&s;proportion, at once dangerous and di&s;honourable, furni&s;hes to one the means of corruption, and places the other in a &s;ituation to be corrupted. In America we make but little difference in this re&s;pect between the legi&s;lative and the execu|tive parts of government; but the fir&s;t is much better treated than in France.</P>
<P>"But however I may con&s;ider the &s;ubject of which you, Sir, have propo&s;ed the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, I am anxious that you &s;hould have no doubt of my entire re&s;pect for your&s;elf. I &s;hould al&s;o add, that I am not the per&s;onal enemy of kings; on the contrary, no per&s;on can be more &s;incere than my&s;elf in wi&s;hing to &s;ee them in the happy and honourable &s;tate of plain individuals. But I am the declared, open, and intrepid enemy of that which is called monarchy, and I am &s;o on account of principles which nothing can alter or corrupt;&mdash;my predilection for humanity, my anxiety for the dignity and honour of the human &s;pecies, my di&s;gu&s;t at &s;eeing men directed by infants, and governed by brutes, and the horror in&s;pired by all the evils which monarchy has &s;cattered over the earth, by the mi&s;ery, the exactions, the wars, and the ma&s;&s;a|cres with which it has wounded humanity.</P>
<P><PB N="$" REF="69">"In &s;hort, it is again&s;t the <HI>whole hell of monarchy</HI> that I have declared war.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>This letter produced a reply from the Abb&egrave; Seyes, in which, after &s;ome ingenious ob&s;ervations on the difference of the two &s;y&s;tems, monarchy and republicani&s;m, the author &s;ays, "I fini&s;h this letter by a remark, with which I ought to have begun it. My letter, in&s;erted in the <HI>Moniteur</HI> of July the 6th, does not an|nounce that I have lei&s;ure to enter into a controver&s;y with repub|lican <HI>policrates</HI>. My words are the&s;e:
<Q>&startq;I &s;hall, perhaps, &s;oon have &endq;time to develope this que&s;tion.</Q>
Why &s;oon? Becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded that the National A&s;&s;embly will in a &s;hort time put the la&s;t hand to their work, and that it is upon the very point of be|ing fini&s;hed.&mdash;Till then it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to leave my daily occupations, to fill the journals with any &s;ort of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Mr. Paine returned from France, 13th July, 1791, previous to the Anniver&s;ary of the French Revolution, he was at the Society on the 4th of November, where he then was a welcome gue&s;t, and thanks were given him for his <HI>Rights of Man</HI>, when his health was drank; Mr. P. in return gave <HI>the Revolution of the World</HI>. From this fe&s;tive &s;cene Mr. P. retired to Fetter-lane, where he conver&s;ed but with few, except Mr. Horne Tooke and Mr. Chapman, who was employed to print the &s;econd part of the Rights of Man, at who&s;e ho&s;pitable table he u&s;ed to &s;pend the evening, till on the 16th of January, 1792; Mr. P. with his <HI>u&s;ual attention</HI> to the <HI>Rights of Women</HI>, in&s;ulted Mrs. Chapman&mdash;the Printer then turned the Author out of doors, without regarding his <HI>Dignity</HI> or his <HI>Independance</HI>, exclaim|ing that he had no more <HI>Principle than a Po&s;t, or Religion than a Ru&s;|&s;ian</HI>; he then returned the whole of his Papers, which was now transfered to Mr. Crowther, who printed the Second Part, of which 5000 was &s;old.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine acknowledges, the profits ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of his Rights of Man, has produced upwards of One Thou&s;and Pounds, which he has directed to the Society for Con&s;titutional informa|tion, to apply it to &s;uch purpo&s;es they &s;hall &s;ee proper. His let|ter in the Argus, is dated July 6, 1792. Several thou&s;and impre&s;|&s;ions are &s;truck off, on an inferior paper, and di&s;tributed at 6d. each part. He has al&s;o wrote two letters to Lord On&s;low, and one to Mr. Henry Dundas, which are wrote in a very &s;pirited manner.</P>
<P>Biography treats only of the pa&s;t; prophecy can alone reveal the future; what may be our Author's fate, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to foretell.</P>
