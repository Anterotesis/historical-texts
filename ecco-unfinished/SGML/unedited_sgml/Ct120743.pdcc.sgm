<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>The In&s;truction of Children having been always thought by wi&s;e Men of great U&s;e, both with regard to the pre|&s;ent Age, and to Po&s;terity; and mo&s;t of the Books, which have been made u&s;e of to introduce Children into an Habit of Reading, being &s;uch as tend rather to Cloy than Entertain them: I have thought fit, with &s;hort De&s;crip|tions of Animals, and Picture fairly draw (which la&s;t Experiences &s;hews them to be much delighted with) to engage their Attention. I have there|fore extracted from &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Authors a &s;hort Account of Bea&s;t, Birds, Fi&s;hes, Serpents, and
<PB REF="4">In&s;ects: which I hope will prove the more acceptable; there having been nothing done (that I know of) in this Nature, &s;o compendiou&s;ly for the En|tertainment of Children. I have for|born to be very particular in the De|&s;cription of tho&s;e Animals, which almo&s;t every Child is acquainted with. If this brief E&s;&s;ay &s;hall any ways con|tribute to the End propos'd, let God have the Glory, and the Compiler the good VVi&s;hes and Prayers of Parents.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF BEASTS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="book">
<HEAD><HI>BOOK I.</HI> Of Quadrupeds, or Four-footed Bea&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. _THE LION, ju&s;tly &s;tyled by all Writers the King of Bea&s;ts, is gene|rally of a dun Colour; but not without &s;ome Exceptions, as black, white, red, in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and &s;ome other Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> The Hair of &s;ome of them is Curl'd and &s;ome long, &s;hagged, and thin. His Head is va&s;tly large and &s;trong; his No&s;e thick; his Mouth very wide; his Eyes are red; fiery, and hollow, not very round, nor long, loo$ $$wry. His fore-feet have five di&s;tinct Claws, on ea$$ $word$, and the hinder but four; all crooked, &s;harp and ex$$eding hard. His Sight and Smelling are ve|ry acute, and he &s;leeps with his Eyes open. He can't endure Fire. When other wild Bea&s;ts hear his terrible roaring Voice, all are &s;urpriz'd with Fear, and dare not &s;tir; though he is not without his Fear of &s;ome Creatures, &s;uch (as is reported) the great Dogs of <HI>In|dia,</HI> &amp;c. with which they hunt and kill Lions. He is mo&s;t commonly taken with Nets, and other Snares. Lions are thought to be long liv'd, becau&s;e many of them have been found toothle&s;s; but this is no certain Sign, as it may proceed from their corrupt Breath, or other Cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE LIONESS, the Female of the &s;ame Kind, is found in the &s;ame Countries, with the &s;ame Nature and Properties: but has no Mane at all, which
<PB N="3" REF="11">is proper to the Male only, to who&s;e Shoulders and Neck 'tis a great Ornament.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE JACCALL, or <HI>Wild Dog,</HI> (commonly called <HI>the Lion's Provider</HI>) though not much bigger than a Fox; yet is &s;o fierce and bold, that is &s;eizes on &s;uch Bea&s;ts as Cows, Hogs, Sheep, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ome|times it will attack a Man. It is reported, that when this Creature &s;eizes his Prey, he makes an hideous Noi&s;e, which gives notice to the Lion, who immedi|ately comes, if within Hearing; at who&s;e Sight the Jaccall goes a little a&s;ide, till the Lion has fully &s;atis|fied his Hunger, and marches off; and then returns, to feed on what the Lion has left. His Head is like a Foxe's, and his Body like a Badger's.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE PANTER is in Shape &s;omewhat like a Lione&s;s, but not quite &s;o large. His Hair is &s;hort and mo&s;&s;y, his Skin is of a bright yellow, beautifully mark'd with round black Spots, and is &s;aid to &s;end forth a fragrant Smell, and bears a great Price. He is a very fierce and cruel Bea&s;t, greedy of Blood, very &s;wift, and catches his Prey by leaping. It is the Na|ture of this Creature, in &s;ome Places, to hide him&s;elf among&s;t the thick Boughs of Trees, and to &s;urprize his Prey. by leaping upon it &s;uddenly. His Tongue in licking grates like a File.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE LEOPARD is both in Shape $$$ure and Colour, very much like a Panther, being $$$ted like that Creature, and is &s;aid to be enge$ $word$ be|tween a Panther and a Lione&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. THE TIGER is in Shape &s;omewhat like a Lione&s;s, but has a &s;hort Neck. His Skin is beauti|fully &s;potted, not with round Spots, like a Panther, no$ with &s;everal different Colours. It is very wild and fierce, exceeding ravennous, and of a prodigious Swiftne&s;s. He &s;pares neither Man nor Bea&s;t, but, if he can &s;atisfy his Hunger with the Fle&s;h of Bea&s;ts, he'll not attempt on Mankind. It is &s;eldom taken, but in defence of its Young.</P>
<P N="7">7. THE RHINOCEROS, &s;o called becau&s;e of the Horn in his No&s;e, is bred in <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI> His Colour is like the Bark of a Box-Tree. He is &s;aid to be in &s;hape &s;omewhat like a Wild Boar, and

<PB N="6" REF="14">not much unlike an Elephant; and near as long, but not &s;o high, having &s;horter Legs. He has two Gir|dles upon his Body, like the Wings of a Dragon, from his Back down to his Belly; one towards his Neck and Mane, and the other towards his Loins and hinder Parts. His Skin is &s;o hard, that no Dart is able to pierce it; and cover'd over with Scales like the Shell of a Tortoi&s;e. His Legs are al&s;o &s;caled over down to the Hoofs, which are part|ed into four di&s;tinct Claws. The Horn upon his No&s;e is &s;o very hard and &s;harp, crooked towards the Crown of his Head, that &s;ome &s;ay it will pierce through Iron or Stone: He is &s;aid frequently to whet his Horn again&s;t a Flint, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that he may be prepar'd, whenever he is attack'd by an Enemy. He is a mortal Enemy to the Elephant, whom he &s;eldom meets without a Battle; and aims chiefly at his Bel|ly, being the &s;ofte&s;t Place, which if he mi&s;&s;es, the Elephant is too hart for him with his Trunk and Teeth. The Naturali&s;ts &s;ay, that he grunts like an Hog. The manner of taking him, being &s;o variou&s;ly and uncertainly related, I thought it not worth de|&s;cribing.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE UNICORN, a Bea&s;t, which though doubted of by many Writers, yet is by others thus de&s;cribed: He has but one Horn, and that an exceed|ing rich one, growing out of the middle of his Fore|head. His Head re&s;embles an Hart's, his Feet an Elephant's, his Tail a Boar's, and the re&s;t of his Body an Hor&s;e's. THe Horn is about a Foot and half in length. His Voice is like the Lowing of an Ox. His Main and Hair are of a yellowi&s;h Colour, His Horn is as hard as Iron, and as rough as any File, twi&s;ted or curled, like a flaming Sword; very &s;traight, &s;harp, and every where black. excepting the Point. Great Virtues are attributed to it, in expel|ling of Poi&s;on, and curing of &s;everal Di&s;ea&s;es. He is not a Bea&s;t of prey.</P>
<P N="9">9. OF BEARS there are two Kinds, a Greater and Le&s;&s;er; the latter of which is more apt to climb Trees. <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> and other Northern Countries pro|$$ce white Bears, for the mu&s;t part of a very large
<PB N="7" REF="15">&s;ize. The Head of a Bear is his weake&s;t Part, as the Head of a Lion is the &s;tronge&s;t, By a &s;mall Blow on his Head he has often been killed. His Mouth is like an Hog's, but longer; being armed with Teeth on both &s;ides, like a Saw. He will not willingly fight with an armed Man; but, when he does, he &s;tands upright, and takes the Man between his fore Feet, and hugs him; but the Man, being covered all over with a kind of Iron Armour, re|ceives no hurt; and may ea&s;ily, with a &s;harp Wea|pon, pierce through his Heart. He is generally ta|ken with Nets, into which he is driven, or allured by &s;ome Stratagem. The Bear is a great &s;leeper, and a &s;luggi&s;h indolent Creature, yet not ob&s;erved to be long lived; they &s;hould rather &s;eem to be &s;hort lived, from their very &s;hort period of ge&s;tation, or going with young, Scarce, reaching to forty Days.</P>
<P N="10">10. THE ANT BEAR is a four-footed Bea&s;t, as big as a pretty large Dog, with rough, dark brown Hair. It has &s;hort Legs, a long No&s;e, little Eyes, a very little Mouth, and a Tongue like an Earth. worm, five or &s;ix Inches long. It feeds on Ants, and is commonly &s;een near an Ant's Ne&s;t. It takes its Food, by laying its No&s;e down flat on the Ground, upon or near the Path that the Ants travel in; and puts our its Tongue cro&s;s the Path, the Ants pa&s;&s;ing to and fro, when they come to it making a &s;top; and in a few Minutes the Tongue will be covered all over with Ants; which Creature draws in &s;uddenly, and &s;o eats them very greedily. It is to be met with in &s;everal Parts of <HI>Armenia.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. THE WOLF is a very ravenous Creature, and as dangerous to meet with when hungry, as any Bea&s;t whatever: But, when his Belly is full, he is to Men and Bea&s;ts as meek as a Lamb. It inhabits the Mountains, except in Winter time, when it roars about the Gates of Cities and Towns; and kills both Sheep and Goats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He is very &s;ubtil in &s;eiz|ing, and de&s;troying &s;uch Creatures as are &s;tronger than him&s;elf.

<P N="12">12. THE OUNCE is a mo&s;t cruel Bea&s;t, bred in <HI>Libya,</HI> about as big as a Ma&s;tiff Dog; his Face and Ears being like a Lion's; his Body, Tail, Feet. and Nails, like a Cat's. It is of a very terrible A&s;pect His Teeth are &s;o &s;harp and &s;trong, that he can cut Wood a&s;under with them His Claws are a good De|fen&s;e, being like his Teeth both &s;harp and &s;trong, that he fights with them. The Colour of the upper part of his Body is like whiti&s;h Oak, the lower part of an A&s;h Colour, being every where cover'd with black Spots; but his Tail, more black than the re&s;t of his Body, with large Spots.

<P N="14">14. A BUFFALO has an Head like the Head of an Hart. His Horns are branched, and ragged. His Body is, for the mo&s;t part, like a wild Ox's; and about the &s;ame &s;ize. His Hair is deep and har&s;h, like a Bear's. His Hide is &s;o hard and thick, that the <HI>S$ythians</HI> make Brea&s;t-plates of it, that no Dart can pierce through. It is reported of this Crea|ture,

<P N="15">15. THE BULL is a very &s;trong, fierce Crea|ture, its Strength, in all Parts of its Body, is very great; but e&s;pecially about the Head and Neck. His Forehead &s;eems to be made for Fight; having &s;hort thick Horns, with which he can to&s;s up into the Air a large Dog, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he furiou&s;ly receives again as it falls, and &s;o gores it &s;ometimes with his Ho$ns, that at length he de&s;troys it.

<P N="18">18. THE HORSE is a very fine &s;tately Bea&s;t; and one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Creatures to Man. This Creature is bred now in mo&s;t Parts of the World. The Hor&s;es of <HI>Turkey, Arahia,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> are account|ed better limb'd and proportion'd than many others; but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Race may ju&s;tly claim the Precedence of mo&s;t European Nations; and are not perhaps infe|rior in Strenth and Beauty to tho&s;e of any other Country. The Hor&s;e is a &s;agacious and docile Ani|mal, fierce and couragious in War. It is &s;aid, that it was very much owing to Hor&s;es, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gain'd &s;uch large Acqui&s;itions in <HI>America:</HI> for, when fir&s;t the Natives &s;aw a Man on hor&s;eback, they thought the Man and the Hor&s;e to be one individual Creature; which &s;truck them into a very great Terror. The Hor&s;e &s;hares a middle Life, &s;carce attaining to forty, and u&s;ual|ly, not to more than twenty; but this &s;hortne&s;s of Life he probably owes to Man: For the Breed of the Sun is now no more, that ranged at large in fre&s;h pa&s;ture; yet the Hor&s;e continues growing till Six, and generates in old Age. The Mare al&s;o goes longer with young than the Woman; and but &s;eldom fouls double. It is wholly &s;uperfluous too nicely and particularly to de&s;cribe the &s;everal Parts and Properties of this Creature, which fall almo&s;t under every one's Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="19">19. THE ASS is a Bea&s;t of Burden, very &s;ervice|able to Mankind in carrying a Man, and &s;uch Uten|&s;ils as he plea&s;es to lade him with; of greater Strength than mo&s;t Animals of his &s;ize; but of a &s;tupid and &s;luggi&s;h Nature. The Female is much e&s;teem'd by Phy|&s;icians, for its Milk, in Con&s;umptions. This Crea|ture is u&s;ually of a dun Colour, and has the form of a Cro&s;s upon its Back and Shoulders. He has nearly the &s;ame Age as the Hor&s;e, to be more particular, in de&s;cribing a Creature &s;o well known, is altogether needle&s;s.</P>
<P N="20">20. A MULE is a Bea&s;t of a mixt Nature, engen|der'd of a Mare, and an A&s;s, and re&s;embles an A&s;s more than an Hor&s;e; having long Ears, a Cro&s;s upon the Shoulder, &s;mall Feet, a lean Body, but in mo&s;t other re&s;pects 'tis like an Hor&s;e, it don't propagate at all. The Mule is longer lived than either the Hor&s;e, or A&s;s.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="23">
<P N="21">21. THE FOX is produced in mo&s;t Countries; nor does one of them differ much in Size from another, but much in Colour. In <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> &s;ome of them are black, &s;ome white, and others red. The abode of this Creature in the Day time is in Holes of the Earth; which he never is at the trouble of making; for the Fox, by leaving his Excrements in the Badger's Hole, or Den, thereby takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for him&s;elf, the Badger never caring to come into it any more. The Fox &s;eems well provided for long Life, as being well covered, carnivorous, and living under Ground; yet he is not ob&s;erved to be long lived. Doubtle&s;s he is of the Dog kind, which is but &s;hort lived. The Male of this Species will &s;ometimes couple with a Bitch, and the Female with a Dog. When he is hunted, and the Dogs are ready to take him, he is &s;aid to urine upon his Tall, and &s;trikes it into the Faces of the Dogs: And as many as he touches with his pi&s;t Tail commonly leave off the Cha&s;e, unle&s;s very good of the kind. But, his Wiles and Strategems being &s;o nume|rous, I &s;hall forbear to &s;ay any more of him or them.</P>
<P N="22">22. THE RACOON, a Monkey, le&s;s than a Fox, is grey-hair'd; has a large black Fye, with Whiskers, and No&s;e like a Pig, Tail and Feet like a Rat, a brown|i&s;h Fur on his Back, and a white Belly. It is very prejudicial to Poultry.</P>
<P N="23">23. THE SAGOIN is about the &s;ize of a Rabbet, of a gri&s;led Colour, a Tail like a Rat, Feet like a Squirrel; Face almo&s;t like a Martin, a &s;hort round Ear, and in other re&s;pects like a Monkey. 'Tis bred in <HI>Brazil</HI> in South <HI>America.</HI></P>

<P N="25">25. THE PORCUPINE grows to the heighth of about two Foot and an half. Its Bite is &s;o &s;harp, that no wooden Work, as &s;ome &s;ay, can with&s;tand it. It is &s;o dareing, that it will encounter the mo&s;t dangerous Snake. When it is provok'd, it &s;hoots its Quills, which are about two Spans long, at Man and Bea&s;t. with &s;uch violence, that, if they happen to hit on a Board. they will &s;tick in it; which di&s;charge of tho&s;e Weapons of Artillery, which Nature hath provided for its Defence, if too often repeated, tends to its own De|&s;truction. Its Fle&s;h, in tho&s;e Countries where it breeds, is e&s;teemed by the Natives as good Food.</P>
<P N="26">26. THE BADGER is of two Kinds; one &s;ort like a Dog, the other like a Swine: It differs likewi&s;e in the &s;hape of the Snout, one re&s;embling a Dog's, the other an Hog's; the former of which cats Fle&s;h and Carrion, like a Dog; the latter Fruit and Roots, like a Swine. 'Tis about as big as a Fox, but of a &s;horter and thicker Body. His Skin is hard and rugged; his Hair har&s;h and &s;tubborn: His Back is broad: his Legs are longer on the right Side than the left. His Teeth are prodigious &s;harp; and, when he fights with a Dog, he u&s;eth both his Teeth and Nails, which are al&s;o very &s;harp</P>
<P N="27">27. AN HEDG-HOG is about the bigne&s;s of a o$bbet, but more like an Hog; being cove'd all o|ver with &s;harp thorny Hair, as well as on the Face and Feet, and tho&s;e &s;harp Prickles cover'd with a kind of &s;oft Mo&s;s; but, when 'tis angry, or gathers its Food, it &s;trikes them, by natural In&s;tinct, as &s;harp as Pins, or Needles. He has two Hole$ under his 'Tail to di&s;|charge his Excrements; which no Creature living has be&s;ides. His common Food is Apples, Worms, or Grapes, It is reported, that when he finds Apples on the Ground, under the Trees, he rolls him&s;elf upon them, untill he has fill'd all his Prickles and then carries them to his Den; never having above one in his Mouth. When it is apprehen&s;ive of Danger it draws it &s;elf up as round as a Football; &s;o that nothing ap|pears but the Prickles.</P>

<P N="28">28. THE HYENA, of which there &s;everal &s;orts, is in <HI>Ca&s;area</HI> about the &s;ize of a Fox. It has Bri&s;tles, like an Hor&s;e's Mane, on his Back. It is &s;aid, it can change the Colour of its eyes at plea&s;ure, a thou&s;and times in a Day. When it is very hungry, it enters the Graves of Men, and eats their dead Bodies; yet is its Fle&s;h, in <HI>Syria, Dama&s;ous,</HI> &amp; eaten by Men. Its Feet and Legs are like a Man's; its Colour like a Bear's; and is thought to be engender'd of a Bear and a Dog. it is a Bea&s;t of great Sultilty, that barks, and makes an hideous Noi&s;e in the Night. This Creature is &s;aid, when it goes to drink at the River <HI>Nile,</HI> to take a Sup and away, for fear of the Crocodile.</P>
<P N="29">29. THE MANTICORA, (or, according to the <HI>Per&s;ians, mantiora</HI>) a Devourer, is bred among the <HI>Indians;</HI> having a tripple Row of Teeth beneath and above, and in bigne&s;s and roughne&s;s like a Lion's: as are al&s;o his Feet, Face, and Ears like a Man's; his Tail like a Scorpion's, armed with a Sting, and &s;harp pointed Quills. His Voice is like a &s;mall Trumpet, or Pipe. He is &s;o wild, that 'tis very dif|ficult to tame him: and as &s;wift as an Hart. With his Tail he wounds the Hunters, w$$hether the$$ $ome before or behind him. When the <HI>Indians</HI> take a Wh$$$lp of this Bea&s;t, they brui&s;e its Buttocks and Tail, t$$$ prevent its bearing tho&s;e &s;harp Quills; then it is tame without danger.</P>
<P N="30">30. THE ANTELOPE is as large as a Goat, of a che&s;net Colour, and white under the Belly. His Horns are almo&s;t &s;traight from his Head up, tapering gradually, with Rings at a di&s;tance from one ano|ther, till within an Inch and half of the Top.

<P N="31">31. THE LAMIA, concerning which there are many fictitious Stories, is, (according to the Opinion of &s;ome Writers) the Creature mention'd in the 34th Chapter of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> called in Hebrew <HI>Lilith;</HI> as al&s;o the &s;ame which is mention'd in the 4th of <HI>Lamenta|tions.</HI> It is thought to be the &s;wi&s;te&s;t of all fourfoot|ed Creatures, &s;o that its Prey can &s;eldom or never e&s;|cape it: And by its Fraud it de&s;troys Men, for, when it &s;ees a Man, it &s;ays open his Brea&s;t, and intices him $o draw near; and, when it has him within reach, it falls upon and devours him. It is &s;aid to be bred in <HI>Libya;</HI> and to have a Face and Brea&s;ts like a very beautiful Woman. It has no Voice but that of hi&s;|$&s;ing like a Serpent. Its hinder Parts are like a Goat's, its &s;ore Legs like a Bear's; its Body is &s;caled all over. It is &s;aid to be a Devouter of its own Young.</P>
<P N="32">32. THE ELKE is twice as big as an Hart, and bigger than an Hor&s;e in <HI>Norwey, Sweden,</HI> &amp;c. It is tamed, and put into a Coach, Chariot, or S$edge, to draw Men thro' great Snows, and upon the Ice. It is &s;aid to be more &s;wift, and to run more Miles in one Day, than an Hor&s;e can in two. This Creature was formerly u&s;ed to be pre&s;ented to Princes, and much e&s;teem'd for its &s;ingular Strength and Swiftne&s;s. Its Forehead is broad, and has two very large Horns. The Female has likewi&s;e Horns. His Neck is &s;hort, but thick; his Ears and Back very long. It's Colour is generally like an Hart's, but &s;ometimes all white. Its Horns weighs twelve or fourteen Pounds. There is great Virtue a&s;cribed to its Hoof in Medicine.</P>
<P N="33">33. THE ALLOCAMELUS is a Bea&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> It is about two Yards high, and about five Foot in length: His Head. Neck, and Ears, are like a Mules; but his Neck is as white as a Swan's, his other Parts of a yellowi&s;h Colour: His Body is like a Cimel, and Feet like an O&s;triche's. It has no Horns. The Males di&s;charge their Urine backwards.</P>

<P N="34">34. THE SHEEP is a Creature univer&s;ally known, being one of the chief for human Food. Its Wooll is of great u&s;e for clothing. Mo&s;t Countries have Plenty of this Creature, but none exceed the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Sheep &s;eldom live to ten, tho' a Creature of a moderate Size, and well covered; and tho' &s;haring but a very &s;mall proportion of Gall, yet their coat is exceedingly cur|led, beyond that of any other Animal. The Ram ge|nerates not till the third Year; and continues fit for Generation to the Eighth. The Ewe continues to bear as long as &s;he lives?

<P>The <HI>African</HI> Sheep are &s;hap'd like ours, but not near &s;o big: They have no Wooll, but that want is &s;uppli|ed with Hair; &s;o that here the World &s;eems inverted, the Sheep being hairy, and the Men woolly. They are but a dry and indifferent &s;ort of Meat</P>
<P N="35">35.

His Heir and Neck are like a Buck Goat's, with a long Beard; the other Parts of his Body re&s;emble tho&s;e of an Hart. It inhabits the top of Cliffs, Rocks, and Mountains.</P>

His fore Feet are arm'd with very &s;trong Nails. He is very &s;wift, and hard to be taken.

His Head, Mouth, Feet, and Nails, are like a Cat's. His Beard hangs down on both &s;ides, divided in the middle, being of &s;undry Colours. His Tail is &s;hore and thick: His Ears are erected upright, as the Ears of a Cat.

<P N="44">44. THE CHAMELEON is very rare to be &s;een. It is firmly a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome Naturali&s;ts, that it lives on Air. Tho others have a&s;&s;erted from their own Experience as they a&s;&s;ure us, that upon the Di&s;&s;ec|tion of this Animal, Flies have been found in its Belly: From whence it &s;eems rea&s;onable to conclude, that, however it may live &s;ome time by &s;ucking in the Air, yet that is not its only Nouri&s;hment. It is &s;aid frequently to change its Colour, very often three or four times in half an hour: Which commonly is grey. The Colour it mo&s;tly changes to is very fine green, &s;potted with yellow. Its Skin is very thin, and almo&s;t tran&s;parent. Its Tongue is as long as its whole Body. It is &s;aid to be &s;o timorous, that, when, it de&s;cends from any Heighth, it moves very cautiou&s;|ly, and curls its Tail, by which it can hold fa&s;t about &s;omething or other in its way, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;lip.

Its Belly and Sides are &s;potted with white, which Spots it lo&s;es in old Age. Its Fle&s;h is good for Nouri&s;h|ment, but its Blood, when eaten, occa&s;ions Melan|choly.

This Creature is bred in very many Countries; but the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;eems to have the Pre&s;erene of mo&s;t. The H$nde, the Female of this Creature, has no Horns.

He is a great Enemy to all kinds of Serpents, which he la|bours to de&s;troy, wherever he finds any: But is afraid of almo&s;t all other Creature.

Though it lives in and upon the Water, yet it is forced to take Breath. It is exceeding &s;wift in pur&s;uit of its Prey, which are mo&s;tly Fi&s;h, with which he fills his Den &s;o full, that it &s;tinks to that degree, as to corrupt the Air.

THE BEAVER builds an Hou&s;e as the Musk-Rat, only much larger; and with Timber makes Dams over narrow Rivers, to catch Fi&s;h, by &s;tanding to watch them thereon, and jumping upon them on a &s;udden. It is a very &s;ubtil Creature; and there is an orderly Government among their Species. In their Works each knows his proper Buni&s;e&s;s and Station; and the Over&s;eers beat tho&s;e young ones that loiter, and will make them work &s;toutly. It is about the &s;ize of a Fox, or a Badger.

<PB N="71" REF="78">From the Chin hang down &s;mall Feathers like Hair, imitating a Beard; whence by &s;ome it is called <HI>the bearded Eagle.</HI> The Feathers of the whole Body are parti-coloured, being whiti&s;h, duski&s;h, and ru&s;ty. Its Legs are almo&s;t wholly cover'd with dusky Feathers, &s;omewhat inclining to yellow. Be&s;ides the Feathers, the whole Body is cover'd with a white and &s;oft Down, as the Skin of a Swan. The Talons are very black and hooked. This Eagle feeds only on Fi&s;h.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE</HI> BLACK EAGLE is about twice as big as a Raven. The Jaws and Eyelids are bare of Feathers, and &s;omewhat reddi&s;h; the Head, Neck, and Brea&s;t, black. In the middle of the Back, be|tween the Shoulders, it has a large white Spot da&s;h'd with red; the Rump red.

By the figure of its Tail alone it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other Birds of Prey. Her tail &s;erves her for a Rudder, to direct her flight through the Air, whence &s;ome learned Men have thought, that Men at fir&s;t learn'd the Art of fleering a Ship from this Bird.

<P N="22">22. <HI>THE</HI> FERN OWL, or <HI>Churn Owl,</HI> or <HI>Goal-&s;ucker,</HI> is a very beautiful Bird for Colour, being more like a Cuckow than an Owl; and it is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other Birds, by the Structure of its Bill and feet. Its Bill in Proportion to its Body, is the lea&s;t of all Birds, and a little crooked. It hath a huge wide Mouth and Swallow.

The Parrot only, with the Crocodile, moves the upper Jaw, as all other Animals do the lower. The Tongue is broad, and re&s;embles a Man's.

<P N="24">24. The RAVEN is a very large <HI>Fowl,</HI> being in length, from the tip of the Bill to the end of the tail, about two foot. The <HI>Bill</HI> is long, thick, &s;harp, and very black; the upper Chap &s;omewhat hooked, but not &s;o as in Hawks, the lower &s;treight; the fea|thers are black all over the body, having a blue Splen|dour or Glo&s;s; which is &s;een e&s;pecially in the tail and Wings. The belly is &s;omething paler, in|clining $word$ brown. It hath large crooked Claws. The Raven feeds not only upon <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>In&s;ects,</HI> but al|&s;o upon the Carca&s;&s;es of <HI>Bea&s;ts, Birds,</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;hes;</HI> moroever, it &s;ets upon, kills, and devours living <HI>Birds,</HI> after the manner of Hawks. Ravens abound in all Countries, they bring hardy <HI>Birds,</HI> that will ea&s;ily bear all Changes of Weather, fearing neither Heat nor Cold. The Raven lays about five or &s;ix Eggs before it begins to &s;it, of a pale greeni&s;h blue, full of black Spots, This <HI>Bird</HI> is &s;aid to live to a very great Age, forty or fifty Years, or upwards.</P>
<P N="25">25. <HI>THE</HI> Common or CARRION CROW is le&s;&s;er than the Raven, being about eighteen Inches in length. The Bill is &s;trong, thick, and &s;treight, The Colour of the whole Body is black, only the ground or bottom of the Feathers of a lead, or dirk a&s;h Colour. This Bird delights to feed upon Carrion, that is, Carca&s;&s;es of dead Animals when they begin to putrefy. It likewi&s;e kills and devours living Birds, in like manner as the Raven; moreover it eats Grain and all &s;orts of In&s;ects, in <HI>England</HI> at lea&s;t. For be|yond Seas (they &s;ay) it meddles with no &s;ort of Grain. It builds upon high Trees, and lays four or five Eggs at a time, like the Raven, but le&s;s. The Crow is &s;aid to have a very &s;agacious Scent, &s;o that it is difficult to &s;hoot it, the Bird &s;melling the Gunpowder far off.</P>
<PB N="91" REF="96">
<P N="26">26. <HI>THE</HI> ROOK is &s;omething bigger than the Crow. It hath no Craw, but, in&s;tead thereof, the Gullet below the Bill is dilated into kind of Bag, wherein it brings Meat to &s;eed its Young. Its Co|lour i black, but brighter than that of the Crow. The Rooks build many together, upon high Tre$$ about Gentlemen's Hou&s;es, who are much delighted with the Noi&s;e they make in Breeding-time: Both Cock and Hen &s;it by turns. Their Eggs are like $word Crow's, but le&s;&s;er, &s;potted with greater Spots. I$ is &s;aid, that when Roooks build, one of the Pair al|ways &s;it to watch the Ne&s;t, till it be fini&s;hed, whil&s;t the other goes about to fetch Materials: El&s;e, if both go, and leave the Ne&s;t unfini&s;hed, as &s;ometimes they venture to do, their Follow-Rooks, e'er they return again, will have robb'd them, and carried away to their &s;everal Ne&s;ts all their Sticks, and wh$$$ver el&s;e they had got together. Hence, perhaps, the Word <HI>Rooking</HI> with $word$ u&s;ed for cheating or abou&s;ing. Young Rooks are good Food.</P>
<P N="27">27. <HI>THE</HI> JACKDAW is much le&s;&s;er than a$ Crow. It h$$ a large Head, and a &s;trong Bill. The hinder Part of the Head, as far as the middle of the Neck, inclines to an a&s;h Colour, as al&s;o the brea&s;t and belly, but le&s;s, el&s;e the whole Plumage is black, with a kind of blue Glo&s;s; the fore-Part of the Head is of a$ deeper black. It &s;eeds upon Nuts, Fruits, Seeds, and In&s;ects. Jackdaws u&s;ually frequent and build in ancient Ca&s;tles, Towers, Cliffs, Hou&s;es, and Stone-Walls, e&s;pecially if they be de&s;olate and ruin|ous. They lay five or &s;ix Eggs, le&s;&s;er, paler, and having &s;ewer Spots than tho&s;e of Crows.

<P N="28">28 <HI>THE MAGPIE</HI> is about the bigne&s;s of the Jackdaw; and, excepting the whitene&s;s of the Brea&s;t, and Wings, and the length of the tail, it is very much like that Bird. The Head, Neck, Throat, Back, Rump, and lower Belly, are of a black colour. The brea&s;t and Sides are white, as al&s;o the fir&s;t Joint of the Wing. The Wings are &s;maller than the bigne&s;s of the body would &s;eem to require. It is a very crafty and cunning

<P N="38">38. <HI>THE</HI> BEE-EATER is as big as a Black|bird. The Crown of the Head is red, but in &s;ome Birds having &s;omething of green mixt. The Neck and Shoulders are green, with a certain mixture of red. The whole Belly and Brea&s;t, as far as the Chin, are blue; this Colour is deepr near the Chin, fainter on the Brea&s;t and Belly.

The long Feathers of the Tail are all of a che&s;nut Colour, beautified with mo&s;t elegant gold Lines, tending upwards, but ending in tips of a very deep green; and tho&s;e forked, like Swallows Tails. The circular Spots, or the Eyes of the Feathers, are particolour'd of a deep green, &s;hin|ing like a cry$olite, a gold, and &s;apphire Colour: For tho&s;e Eyes con&s;i&s;t of four Circles of different Co|burs; the fir&s;t a golden, the &s;econd a ch$&s;nut, the third a green, the fourth or middle place, is taken up by a blue or &s;apphire.colour'd Spot, almo&s;t of the figure and bigne&s;s of a Kidney-Bean.

Tur|keys love hot Countries; yet they can bear cold ones well enough, after they are grown up and have been u&s;ed to them; but their young chickens are very tender, and not to be reared without Care and At|tendance.

<P N="62">62. <HI>THE ROBIN-RED-BREAST</HI> is a <HI>Brid</HI> well known in almo&s;t all Countries, that but little $eed to be &s;aid of it. In Winter time, to &s;eek Food, $t enters into Hou&s;es with much Confidence; being a very hold <HI>Bird,</HI> &s;ociable, and familiar with Man. In the Summer time, when there is plenty of Food in the Woods, it withdraws it &s;elf in the mo&s;t de&s;ert Places. It is a &s;olitary <HI>Bird;</HI> and feeds &s;ingly: whence the Proverb took its ri&s;e, <HI>Unum arbu&s;tum $word$ alit duous Erithacos;</HI> One Shrub doth not produce $no Robin-red-brea&s;ts. It feeds upon In&s;ects, Ants Eggs, Crumbs of bread, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For a Song-bird it is by &s;ome e&s;teemed little inferior to the Nightingale. The Male may be known and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Female by the Colour of his Legs, which are blacker, and by certain Hairs which grow on each &s;ide his <HI>Bill</HI> and his brea&s;t being of a deeper red.</P>
<P N="63">63, LARKS are di&s;tingui&s;hed from other &s;orts of Birds; 1. By their long Heel or Claw of the back Toe; which is the characteri&s;tick Mark of the&s;e Birds. $word$ by the earthly Colour of their Feathers 3. By their &s;inging as they fly, mounting up in the Air. The Common Sky-Lark is not much bigger than an Hou&s;e Sparrow, yet longer bodied. It builds its Ne&s;t &s;ometimes in plain open Ground, under &s;ome clod of Earth; and &s;ometimes is Corn, or thick high Gra&s;s: and though in Winter we &s;ee great Plocks of them, yet we find the &s;ewe&s;t of their Ne&s;ts of any Birds that are &s;o plentiful. It breeds thrice in a Year, in <HI>May, July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> rearing her Young very &s;uddenly: &s;o that, if you have a Ne&s;t, you mu&s;t take them as &s;oon as they are &s;poon-feather|ed, or el&s;e you run the ri&s;que of lo&s;ing them, for they will get them gone of a &s;udden. Young Ne&s;tlings may be brought up almo&s;t with any Meat; but if you give them Sheep's Heart and Egg chopt together, $tili they are about three Weeks old, it will not be a|mi&s;s: and when they come to eat alone, give them O$tmeal, Hemp&s;eeds and Bread mixed together with $$$le Egg.</P>

<P N="64">64. <HI>THE</HI> WOOLDLARK is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Common Lark by the following Marks; 1. Whi&s;t|ling like a Blackbird. 2. A Cricle of white Feathers encompa&s;&s;ing the Head, from Eye to Eye, like a Crown or Wreath. 3. The fir&s;t or outmo&s;t Feather of the Wing being much &s;horter than the &s;econd; whereas in the Common Lark it is near equal. 4. The outmo&s;t Feathers of the Tail having white tips. 5. That it &s;its upon Trees. 6. It is le&s;&s;er than the Common Lark, but hath a &s;horter, thicker, or round|er Body, for its bigne&s;s. The Woodlark is campa|rable to the Nightingale for &s;inging, and by &s;ome preferred before it. It is a very tender Bird, and yet breeds the &s;oone&s;t of any in <HI>England.</HI> It builds mo&s;t commonly in Lays, where the Gra&s;s hath been pretty rank, and is grown ru&s;&s;et, under &s;ome large Turf. to &s;helter its Ne&s;t from the Wind and Wea|ther.</P>
<P N="65">65. <HI>THE</HI> CREASTED LARK differs from the Common Lark; 1. In bigne&s;s. 2. In the Cre&s;t. 3. In the Colour of the Back, which is le&s;s &s;potted, and not &s;o beautiful. 4. In the mea&s;ure of the Tail, which in this Bird is &s;horter, 5. In that it &s;oars not &s;o$ much in the Air; and when it mounts up, &s;tays not &s;o long there. 6. That it flies not in Flocks, as they do. La&s;tly, It is frequently &s;een about the Banks of Lakes and Rivers.</P>
<P N="66">66. <HI>THE</HI> NIGHTINGALE, being the Chief of all &s;inging Birds, is about the bigne&s;s of a Gold$ finch, or Red&s;tart, and long bodied.

The ends of the Wings are not of &s;o deep a &s;carlet, as neither the Tail. The Colour of the whole is a lovely &s;carlet, only the Head and Tail more faint. Seeing its Image in a Gla&s;s it hath many &s;trange Ge&s;ticulations making an hi&s;&s;ing Noi&s;e, lowring its Cre&s;t, &s;etting up its Tail after the manner of the Peacock, &s;haking its Wings; in fine, &s;triking at the Looking gla&s;s with its Bill.</P>
<P N="68">68. <HI>THE</HI> BLACK CAP is a very &s;mall Bird, not weighing above half an Ounce.

The Tail is al&s;o of a dusky Colour, with a little Tincture of green. The nether part of the Neck, the Throat and upper part of the Brea&s;t, are of a pale a&s;h Colour: the lower Belly white, tinc|tured with yellow. This Bird is common in <HI>Italy;</HI> it is al&s;o found in <HI>England,</HI> but more rarely.</P>
<P N="69">69. <HI>THE</HI> HUMMING BIRD is the lea&s;t of all Birds. The Head, together with the Feathers is of the bigne&s;s of a mean-&s;ized &s;weet Cherry: the Neck is three quarters of an Inch long: the Body an Inch and a quarter. The Body, together with the Feathers, is &s;carce equal in bigne&s;s to a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Olive, Its Colour is wonderfully re&s;plendent; &s;o that it can|not be well repre&s;ented by any Painter: for with a green, &s;uch as is &s;een in the Necks of Peacocks, a gol|den, flame colour, and yellow, are &s;trangely mixt; &s;o that being expo&s;ed to the Sun-beams it &s;hines ad|mirably. It makes its Ne&s;t in the Boughs of Trees, of the bigne&s;s of an <HI>Holland</HI> Schilling; and lays very white Eggs, two for the mo&s;t part, of an oval figure, not bigger than Pea&s;e. It is fed and nouri&s;hed with
<PB N="123" REF="128">Honey Dew, and the Juice of Flowers, which it &s;ucks out of them with its Bill. It flies very &s;wift, and makes a humming Noi&s;e like a Hornet, or Bee: hence it took its Name in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of Humming Bird.</P>

This Ne&s;t is of the figure of an Egg, erect upon one end, and hath in the middle of the &s;ide a Door, by which it goes in and out. It lays nine or ten, and &s;ometimes more Eggs, at a &s;itting. It is &s;trange to admiration, that &s;o &s;mall a bodied Bird &s;hould cover &s;o great a number of Eggs; and more &s;trange, that it &s;hould feed &s;uch a Company of Young, and not mi&s;s one Bird, and that in the dark al&s;o.

<P N="71">71. TITMICE are a &s;ort of &s;ma$l Birds, that are found for the mo&s;t part about Trees; and live chiefly upon In&s;ects which they find there.

<P N="82">82. <HI>THE</HI> CANARY BIRD is of the begne&s;s of the common Titmou&s;e. It hath a very &s;weet and &s;hrill Note, which at one Breath continued for a long time, without Intermi&s;&s;ion, it can draw out &s;ometimes in length, &s;ometimes rai&s;e very high, by a various, and almo&s;t mu&s;ical Inflection of its Voice, making ve|ry plea&s;ant and artificial Melody. The Sound it makes is very &s;harp, and &s;o quavering, that &s;ome|times, when it &s;tretches and exerci&s;es its little Throat and Chaps, whi&s;tling with all its force, it vehement|ly &s;trikes, and even deafens the Ears of the Hearers with its &s;hrillne&s;s. Many are delighted with this kind of its &s;inging, many al&s;o are offended, &s;aying that they are &s;tunn'd and deafned with it.</P>
<P N="83">83. <HI>THE</HI> CRANE is a large bodled Fowl, weighing &s;ometimes ten Pounds. Its Neck and Legs are very long. The top of the Head is black; from the Bill to the hinder Part covered with black Hairs or Bri&s;tles, rather than Feathers. The Throat and &s;ides of the Neck are of a black Hue. The Back, Shoulders, covert Feathers of the Wings, Brea&s;t, and all the Belly, and Things, are a&s;h-coloured. In the Fen-Countries in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Cambridge&s;hire,</HI> there are great Flocks of Cranes; but whether or no they breed in <HI>England</HI> is not cartainly known. Tho the Crane be a Water Fowl, yet it is thought no to feed at all upon Fi&s;h, but only upon Herbs, Grain, and Seeds of divers &s;orts and al&s;o upon In|fects. The Fle&s;h of the&s;e Fowls is very &s;avoury, and well ta&s;ted, not to &s;ay delicate.</P>
<P N="84">84. <HI>THE</HI> BALEARIC CRANE is in the &s;hape of its Body like a Stork.

It hath a black Cre&s;t on the Head four Inches high, The Feathers on the crown of the Head and the Chin are white, The Neck white and a&s;h coloured, tinctured with red, The throat white, being de|licately painted with black Spots. The Bre&s;t, Back, and Wings, are various, inelining to yellow, a&s;h, and black. It feeds upon Fi&s;hes, Frogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Herons, build &s;ometimes on the tops of great Trees, like Rooks, and for the mo&s;t part many together.</P>
<P N="86">86 The le&s;&s;er a&s;h-coloured Heron, called by the <HI>Germans</HI> the <HI>Night-Raven.</HI> is le&s;&s;er than the common Heron, and hath a &s;horter Neck. Its back and crown are black: its neck a&s;h coloured: its throat and belly tinctured with yellow. A white line is extended from the Eyes to the Bill. From the hinder part of the Head it hath a Cre&s;t of three Feathers five Inches long, hanging down over the Back; whereby it differs from all other Birds. Its Wings and Tail are of an a&s;h colour: its Bill black: its Legs and Feet are of a yellowi&s;h green. This Bird is called <HI>Night-Raven,</HI> becau&s;e in the <HI>Night-time</HI> it cries with an uncouth Voice, like one that &s;trains to Vomit.</P>

The back Claw of this Bird, which is remarkably thick and long above the re&s;t, is wont to be &s;et in &s;ilver for a Picktooth? and is thought to have a &s;ingular Property of pre&s;erving teeth.

<P N="94">94. <HI>THE REDSHANK,</HI> is of a middle fize for bigne&s;s, between a Lapwing and a Snipe, approaching to the quantity of a Plover. The Head, and Back, are of a dusky a&s;h Colour, &s;potted with black: the Throat is particolour'd of black and white, the black being drawn down longways the Feathers. the Brea&s;t is whiter with fewer Spots It is common on the &s;andy Shores about <HI>England</HI> every where. It breeds in Mar&s;hes, and, if any one come near its Ne&s;t, it flies about, making a'great noi&s;e, like the Lapwing.</P>
<P N="95">95. <HI>THE LAPWING,</HI> is a Bird in all Countries well known: and every where to be met with, In the North of <HI>England</HI> they call it <HI>Te-wit</HI> from its Cry. It is of the bigne&s;s of a common Pigeon. It lays four or five Eggs, of a dirty yellow, all over painted with great black Spots, and Strokes. It builds its Ne&s;t on the Ground, in the middle of &s;ome Field or Heath, open, and expo&s;ed to view, laying only &s;ome few Straws, or Bents, under the Eggs, that the Ne&s;t be not &s;een: the Eggs being &s;o like in Colour to the Ground on which they lie, it is not ea&s;y to find them, though they lie &s;o open. The Young &s;o &s;oon as they are hatcht, in&s;tantly for&s;ake the Ne&s;t, run|ning away with the thick Down, and follow the Old ones like Chickens.

My Author &s;ays, for his part, he could ea&s;ily be induced to believe it: for that he had been a&s;&s;ured, by credible Per&s;ons, that a Goo&s;e will live an hundred Years or more. But that a Swan is much longer lived than a Goo&s;e, he bring|eth many convincing Arguments to prove. The Swan feeds not upon Fi&s;h, but either upon Herbs growing in the Water, and their Roots and Seeds, or upon Worms and other In&s;ects, and Shell fi&s;h. Its Fle&s;h is black, hard, and tough, being no de&s;irable Dain|ty. yet for its rarity, &s;erves as a Di&s;h to adorn Great Men's Tables, at Fea&s;ts and Entertainments.

<HEAD>BOOK III.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>WHALE</HI> is about fifty or &s;ixty Foot in length. &s;ometies &s;eventy: and about 12 high; the length of his Chap about eighteen Foot. The <HI>Tongue</HI> is &s;aid to be as big as a large <HI>Feather-$ed</HI> It has only two large <HI>Fins,</HI> which are fa&s;tened to the <HI>Shoulder-blade.</HI> The <HI>Tail</HI> is forked, like a Swallow<HI>'s.</HI> Its colour on the <HI>Back</HI> is blacki&s;h, the Belly white: The back of the Fi&s;h is commonly full of Scars and Scratches, which it is &s;up|po&s;ed to receive from its &s;wimming under the Ice. Whales are taken in large Numbers about <HI>Ice-land, Green-land,</HI> and other Northern Countries, by the <HI>Engli&s;h, H$llanders,</HI> &amp;c. Our <HI>South-&s;ea</HI> Company &s;end annually, on this Expedition, 22 or 23 &s;ail of <HI>Ships.</HI> every <HI>Ship</HI> being above 300 <HI>Tons Burthen;</HI> and each <HI>car|r$ing</HI> forty five Men and &s;ix <HI>Boats.</HI> This Fleet u&s;ual|ly &s;ails about the end of March, but &s;eldom begins to fi&s;h till th$ month of May. When they begin their Fi&s;hery, the Ship <HI>is</HI> fa&s;tened, or moor'd with No&s;e-hooks to the Ice. Two Boats, each man'd with &s;ix Men (which <HI>is</HI> the <HI>Complement</HI> of every <HI>Boat</HI> in the <HI>fleet</HI>) are order'd by the Commodore, (which <HI>is</HI> an Officer who <HI>is</HI> the Head of every Ship<HI>'s</HI> Company, and ap|pointed on purpo&s;e to manage the Fi&s;hery) to look out for the coming of the Fi&s;h, for two Hours,
<PB N="151" REF="156">and then are reliev'd by two more, and &s;o by turns. The&s;e two Boats lies at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance from the Ship, each &s;eparated from the other, fa&s;tened to the Ice with thier Boat-hooks, ready to let go in an In&s;tant, at the fir&s;t &s;ight of the Whale. Here the Dexterity of the Whale hunters is to be admired, for, &s;o &s;oon as the Fi&s;h &s;hews her&s;elf. eve|ry Man to his Oar, and they ru&s;h on the Mon&s;ter with a prodigious &s;wiftne&s;s; at the &s;ame time taking care to come abat, or behind his Head, that he may not &s;ee the Boat; which &s;ometimes &s;o &s;ca$es him, that he plunges down again, before they have time to &s;trike him. But the greate&s;t Care is to be taken of the Tail. with which it many times does very great damage, both to the Boats and Mariners. The Harpinneer, who is placed in the Head, or Bow of the Boat, &s;eeing the back of the Whale, and making an on&s;et, thru&s;ts the Harping-Iron with all his Might into its Body, by the help of a Staff fixed in it for that purpo&s;e, and leaves it in: a Line being fa&s;ten'd to it of of about two Inches in circomference, and 136 Fathom long. Every Boat is furni&s;h'd with &s;even of the&s;e Lines; which being let run, from the Motion of it they ob&s;erve the Cour&s;e of the Fi&s;h. As &s;oon as ever the Harpinneer has &s;truck the Whale, the third Man in the Boat holds up his Oar, with an Hat on the top, as a Signal to the Ship; at the &s;ight of which, the Man who is appointed to watch gives the Alarm to tho&s;e that are a&s;leep; who in&s;tant|ly let fall their other four Boats, which hang on the Tackles, two on each &s;ide, ready to let go at a Mi|nutes warning, all furni&s;h'd alike with &s;ix Men each, Harping-irons, Lances, Line, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> two or three of the&s;e Boats row to the pl$ce where the Fi&s;h may be expected to come up again, the other to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Boat</HI> that fir&s;t &s;truck the Whale with Line; for the Fi&s;h will &s;ometimes run out two or three <HI>Boats</HI> Lines, all fa&s;tened to each other: for, when the Lines of the fir&s;t <HI>Boat</HI> are almo&s;t run out, they throw the end to the &s;econd, to be fa&s;tened to theirs, and then fol|low the other <HI>Boats,</HI> in pur&s;uit of the Whale; and &s;o likewi&s;e does the &s;econd <HI>Boat,</HI> when their Lines are run out, A Whale &s;ometimes, when &s;he is fir&s;t &s;truck,
<PB REF="157">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="152" REF="158">will run out above an hundred Fathom of Line be|fore the Harpinner is able to t a turn round the Boat's Stem, and with that Swiftne&s;s, that a Man &s;tands ready to quench it if it &s;hould fire, which it frequently does; and I am told, there is a Boat now to be &s;een in the <HI>South-Sea.</HI> Dock at <HI>D$pt-ford,</HI> the Head of which was &s;aw'd off by the &s;wiftne&s;s of the Line's running out: But &s;ometimes it is killed on the Spot, without &s;inking down at all. The Harp|ing-Iron would but little avail to the De&s;truction of this Animal, but part of the Rowers, either at the fir&s;t On&s;et, or, when in order to fetch its Breath it di&s;covers it &s;elf to view; throwing a&s;ide their Oars, and taking up their very &s;harp Lances, they thru&s;t it through the Body, till they &s;ee it &s;purt the Blood through its Blower; the &s;ight of which is a mo&s;t joyful Sign of the Creature's being mortally wound|ed. The Fi&s;hermen, upon the killing of a Whale, are each intitled to &s;ome &s;mall Reward. After the Whale is killed, they cut all the Lines that are fa&s;|tened to it, and the Tail off; then it in&s;tantly turns on its Back; &s;o they tow it to the Ship, where they fa&s;ten Ropes, to keep it from &s;inking; and, when it is cold, begin to cut it up. The Body of a Whale is frequently found to be eighteen or twenty Inches thick of Fat; and yields fifty or &s;ixty Puncheons of Oil, each Puncheon conta$ning &s;eventy four Gallons, and about twelve hundred Pieces of Whalebone, mo&s;t of which are about fifteen Foot long, and twelve Inches broad, which are all taken our of the Jaws, being the Gills of the Fi&s;h: The whole Produce of a Whale being worth One thou&s;and Pounds, &s;ometimes more, or le&s;s, according to the Goodne&s;s of the Fi&s;h. Whil&s;t the Men are at work on the Back of the Fi&s;h; they have Spurs on their Boots, with two Prongs, which come down on each &s;ide of their Feet, left they &s;hould &s;lip, the Back of the Whale being very &s;lippery. The&s;e Ships have Orders to quit tho&s;e Seas by the twenty fourth of <HI>June;</HI> for then the Fi&s;h begin to gender, and are very mi&s;chievous. The Male and Female (as the While catchers relate) cou|ple in a mo&s;t loving manner by Conjunction, Leap|ing, and other Tokens of conjugal Love; and then
<PB N="153" REF="159">&s;wim together, and always pre&s;erve the Friend&s;hip begun, till the Female fired by Lu&s;t, rai&s;ing her Bo|dy perpendicularly quite to her Tail, embraces the Male, meeting it in the &s;ame Po&s;ture with its Fins, as it were with two Arms; and they clo&s;ely conti|nue their Care&s;&s;es for h$lf an Hour or an hour; and after this pre&s;erve an inviolable Cha&s;tity for each other till Death. While they &s;wim, it is not ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the Male from the Female, unle&s;s from hence, that the latter is bigger than the former. The Female has Teats, and &s;uckles her Young after the manner of Land Animals. About five Years ago the <HI>Triton,</HI> one of our <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company's Ships, kill'd a Female Whale; and, whil&s;t they were cutting her up a long Side, a Young one &s;wam about the Ship, and would not for&s;ake the Dam; till at length the Commodore order'd the Boot out to go and kill it: which they did; and it produced four Puncheons of. Oil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There is a &s;mall Fi&s;h, by the Whale-catchers called <HI>Lodd;</HI> of which if the Whales devour any large Numbers, they become as it were drunk, and are tran&s;ported with Rage and Fury, and ex|erci&s;e Outrage again&s;t whatever comes in their way: The Throat of the Whale is &s;o very &s;trait, that it can hardly take in the Arm of a Man; therefore it is &s;trange that this &s;hould be the Fi&s;h that &s;wallow'd up <HI>Janah;</HI> and more &s;trange, when we are a&s;&s;ured by Travellers, that no &s;uch Fi&s;h is ever &s;een in tho&s;e Seas. Some have imagined, that the Prophet was only in the Mouth of the Whale, which indeed is able to hold more than one Man; and more po&s;&s;ible for a Man to continue alive there three Days, than in the Belly of the Fi&s;h; and the Whale, often com|ing up to breathe, might the better affoard the Man an opp$rtunity to breathe al&s;o. But it is more pro|bable that is was not the Whale that &s;wallowed up <HI>Janah;</HI> for the Word <HI>K$$los,</HI> which is tran&s;lated <HI>the Whale,</HI> may as well &s;ignify any other <HI>great Fi&s;h.</HI></P>

He likewi&s;e &s;ays, that the People of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> told him, that they had caught one, in which they found a Man arm'd with a Coat of Mail. The Head and Month of this Fi&s;h are large, in proportion to the re&s;t of the Body. The number of its Teeth is altogether uncertain, and va|ries according to the Age of the Fi&s;h; it having been ob&s;erved and delivered by Men worthy of cre|dit, that this Kind breeds new Teeth every Year as long as it lives. It is &s;aid to have three Rows of Teeth, very hard, &s;trong, and &s;harp. This Fi&s;h is common in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> &amp;c. and is very de&s;truc|tive to tho&s;e Men who divert them&s;elves by Swim|ming; it &s;ometimes biting a Man a&s;under, at other times at lea&s;t taking away a Limb, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet it is of|ten catch'd and eaten by Sailors. When it &s;eizes its Prey, it always turns it &s;elf upon its Back. Tho' it is va&s;tly &s;trong, yet when it takes the Bait it is &s;oon taken, if you play him with the Line. This Fi&s;h when eaten ta&s;tes &s;trong, and it has a very tough Skin.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE</HI> PILOT FISH is of a deep blue; the Belly is of a lighter Colour than the Back or Sides. The Scales are &s;mooth, like a Tench's: Its Back is &s;peckled like a Seal's Skin. When &s;wimming it ap|pears much like a Mackrel; and looks as if it were printed blue and white, like a Barber's Pole. They &s;ay, that the Shark is always attended by one or two of the&s;e Fi&s;h; which he will not devour, tho' never &s;o hungry, becau&s;e they find out the Pray for him. It is reckon'd a very good Fi&s;h to eat.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THE</HI> REMORA, or SUCKING FISH, is about eight or nine Inches long, of a dark blue Co|lour; having a Sucker about two Inches long on the top of his Head. The Mouth is wide; the Eyes &s;mall; the under Jaw longer than the upper, with two Rows of &s;mall &s;harp Teeth. It has two Fins, one on each &s;ide his Gills; two &s;mall ones under its Belly; two near the Tail; and one on the Ridge of the Back. It has its Name from its &s;ucking the Shark$. It is of a very &s;limy Nature, and commonly &s;t$cks
<PB N="157" REF="162">&s;o fa&s;t to Sharks and other large Fi&s;h, as not to be ea&s;ily got off. It is &s;aid, that Remoras are wont to cleave to the Keels of Ships, and hinder their Cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>THE</HI> DOLPHIN is a large Fi&s;h, not much unlike the Porpe&s;&s;e. It &s;wims with two &s;trong Fins, which, like the Arms of a Man, are joyned to the Shoulder-blades; and is &s;aid to be of that &s;wiftne&s;s, that is will ea&s;ily overtake a Ship in full &s;ail before the Wind. It produces its Young from Seed, and not from Spawn, perfect, one at a time, and &s;ome|times two: It goes with Young ten Months; and breeds only in the Summer. It lives about twenty five or thirty Years. They &s;ay that it is a mo&s;t cer|tain Foreboder of a Tempe&s;t &s;hortly to follow, when it more frequently moves its Body, and &s;ports it &s;elf on the Water. They are much deceived, who ima|gine Dolphins to be of the Figure they are u&s;ually repre&s;ented on Signs: that Error being more owing to the unbridled Licence of Statuaries, or Painters, than to any &s;uch thing found in fact: Tho' it mu&s;t be own'd, that at the approach of a Storm, whil&s;t the Dolphins leaping and &s;pringing from the Waves, are &s;een to precipitate them&s;eves into the Deep, they are wont to deceive our Sight, and at that time have &s;ome re&s;emblance of Crookedne&s;s. It is &s;aid it will live a long time out of the Water: One taken at <HI>Ri|mini</HI> (according to <HI>Ge&s;$er</HI>) lived three Days upon Land. Dolphins &s;ometimes &s;wim in Sholes, &s;ome|times the Male and Female together, but never &s;ingly. <HI>$illius</HI> &s;ays, that, when he was in a Ship where many Dolphins were taken, he ob&s;erved them &s;o to deplore with Groans, Lamentations, and a Flood of Tears, their Condition, that he him&s;elf out of Compa&s;&s;ion could not forbear weeping, and threw that which he ob&s;erv'd to groan more than ordinary (the Fi&s;herman being a&s;leep) into the Water; as choo&s;ing rather to damage the Fi&s;hman, than not to relieve the mi&s;era|ble But this gave him but little re&s;t, for all the others increa&s;ed their Groans, as &s;eeming, by not ob|&s;cure Signs, to beg the &s;ame Deliverance. It has been related, that Dolphins have been in great reque&s;t for Food with Princes, and purchas'd at and exce&s;&s;ive Rate; tho' according to the Accounts of &s;ome, their Fle&s;h yields no very grateful Ta&s;te.</P>

<P N="6">6. <HI>THE</HI> FLYING FISH is &s;lender and long, with a large Eye. The Body is in Shape, Scales, and Colour, like to one of our Mullets. The Wings and Fins are as repre&s;ented in the Figure. It flies near a Gun &s;hot before it touches the Water; and, when it has wet its Wings, mounts up again: Being cha&s;ed by the Dolphin, which &s;wims &s;o &s;wift that it often catches it as it drops into the Water.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>THE</HI> SEA UNICORN is a Fi&s;h often found about <HI>Iceland, Greenland,</HI> and other Northern I&s;lands; &s;omewhat of the Nature of a Whale. On the top of the left Part of the upper Jaw, or Fore-head, it hath one only Tooth, or Horn, of a large &s;ize, being &s;ix or &s;even Foot in length, &s;ometimes more; and in thickne&s;s equal, in proportion to its length; &s;t$ight and tapering, curl'd, or twi&s;ted a|bout to the end. The Female is &s;aid to have no Horn, but a Dint or Hollow in that place of her Forehead. The Horn is made u&s;e of by the <HI>Dutch</HI> as Ivory. This Fi&s;h is about nine Foot in length. It Ca&s;ts its Young like the Wale, which is after the manner of Land Animals: And is &s;uppo&s;ed to re|ceive them into her Belly, when in danger. One of our <HI>Greenland</HI> Ships, about two or three Years ago, found a Female of this Kind dead on the Ice, and in the Belly of it a Female Young one, which was in length, from the tip of its Snout to the end of its Tail, &s;ix Foot. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a Young one of that bigne&s;s had been never brought forth; or that the Dam devour'd it for Food; but rather that it took it in, to &s;ecure it from &s;ome great danger. This Account I had from two Per&s;ons wor|thy of Credit, who were Eye witne&s;&s;es of this Fact.</P>
<P N="8">8. A PICKED DOG, or <HI>Hound-Fi&s;h,</HI> has a long round, tapering Body, without Scales. It is cover'd with a &s;harp Skin, which is made u&s;e of to poli&s;h. A$$ b$&s;ter, Arrows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Its Snout is long, and a little round$&s;h at the Point. It &s;eldom weighs twenty Pounds. Many of the&s;e Fi&s;h are taken in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ocean, and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> POR$ESSE is in length from the tip of its Snout to the end of the Tail about three or
<PB N="161" REF="166">four Foot, and about two Foot and half thick. Its Figure is &s;omewhat longi&s;h and roundi&s;h, continually tapering towards the Tail. It is cover'd with a &s;len|der, thin Skin, not fenced with Scales. The Colour of the Back is of a dark blue, inclining to black; from the middle of the &s;ides it begins to whiten, the Belly altogether white: Its Eyes, for the bigne&s;s of the Fi&s;h, are very &s;mall. It has only three Fins, like the Dolphin; one on the middle of the Back, and one on each Shoulder: the Tail is forked. When this Fi&s;h is cut up, its Fle&s;h looks very much like Pork. There are great Numbers of Porpe&s;&s;es &s;een on our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ts, e&s;pecially in Mackrel and Her|ring Sea&s;ons: at which times they are wont to do very great damage to our Fi&s;hermen, by breaking and de&s;troying their Nets to get at the fi&s;h; and &s;ometimes &s;o entangle and wrap them&s;elves up in them, that they are often taken. Porpo&s;&s;es &s;wim but a very little way at a time, before they come up to breathe; and, when they come up, blow or breathe very loud, &s;o that in calm Weather they may be heard at a great di&s;tance: The&s;e Fi&s;h will &s;ometimes pur&s;ue their Prey clo&s;e to the Shore, nay even in the very Harbours.

Nature hath provided it with two &s;orts of In&s;truments for War and Defen&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> her Mouth, wherein are her Teeth, that meet &s;ideways, and not one over the other; with which it defends it&s;elf, and a&s;&s;aults others: And the Sting, which is in its Tail. With its Fangs it lays hold on Robbers, which come to &s;teal its Honey, whil&s;t another comes to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance with its Sting, which generally car|ries Death to any of its own Kind that it pierces; and, for the mo&s;t part, Death to it&s;elf, when it pierces any of the humane Species. The Sting is very taper and &s;harp, apt, when exerted by the Bee, to pierce the Skin, or other harder Body. It con|tains its Poi&s;on about the middle of it, which may be di&s;cover'd by the help of Gla&s;&s;es. The Eyes are very large, cover'd over with a thick horny Mem|brane, which occa&s;ions the dimne&s;s of its Sight. But, to &s;upply this Defect, Nature hath given it two Horns, which grow above its Eyes, about the tenth of and Inch long, in each of which there are two Joints, one in the middle, and another near the end, by which it can put them forth, when it will, to the full length, and draw them in at plea&s;ure. The&s;e are its In&s;truments of Feeling. The Tongue is much longer than the Mouth will contain, and &s;o is doubled underneath, and reacheth a good way down the Brea&s;t. The Body is all over hairy, like a Fox, and the Head too, nay a great part of the Eyes is cover|ed with &s;mall Hairs, but &s;o &s;mall, that they cannot be di&s;cern'd by the naked Eye, without the help of Micro&s;cope, which will al&s;o di&s;cover the Brain in

In the hinder Parts there is a Gut, <HI>&amp;c</HI> as al&s;o a Bottle or Bag, in which it carries its Ho|ney, which it emptieth into the Honey-comb. In this Bag it often fetches Water, to mix up its Sanda|rach, or Bee-bread, for the feeding its Young; a|bout which it is very careful, till they can &s;hift for them&s;elves. That, which has commonly been call'd the <HI>Drone,</HI> appears at length to be nothing el&s;e but the Male Bee, and is about half as big again as the Female, which only is the working Bee, &s;omewhat longer, and not quite &s;o dark-colour'd about the Head and Shoulders; e&s;pecially his Head and Eyes much larger than the Honey-Bee, his Voice more loud and dread|ful, often cau&s;ing Fear where no Fear is, e&s;pecially to the fair and timorous Sex: for he, having no Sting, cannot in the lea&s;t hurt any Creature, but is wholly under the Dominion of the Females. He is &s;mooth about his Neck, and very hairy all over his Back. His Tongue is much &s;horter than that of the <HI>Females;</HI> neither can he work if he would, his Tongue not being long enough to reach the Honey out of the &s;ocketed Flowers. This Male Bee, or &s;uppos'd <HI>Drone,</HI> is not only helpful, but nece&s;&s;ary to the Females, in the managing of their Young: for, by his great Heat, he &s;its, and hatches the Brood, keeping the Eggs warm, whil&s;t the Honey Bees, or Females, follow their delightful Vocation of gather|ing and bringing home of Honey: During which time the <HI>Drone</HI> Bees are not &s;uffer'd to &s;tir from the Brood, but about one or two of the Clock, when the chief part of the Day's Work is over with the Bees, mo&s;t of them, repairing home, take care of their own Brood; and &s;o give leave to the&s;e their obedient ma&s;culine Servants, to recreate them&s;elves abroad; their Heat now being no longer nece&s;&s;ary within doors.

Now, tho' they &s;hould be able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the&s;e lat|ter Enemies, yet conceiving a Di&s;ta&s;te again&s;t their Hive, by rea&s;on of the dete&s;table Smell of the Mice, they take a warm Day, and fly away all together, tho' perhaps to an equal, if not a greater, expo&s;ing them&s;elves to Death, than if they had &s;taid at home: and have &s;ometimes left Quarts of Honey behind them. The Bee hath, be&s;ides the Mou&s;e, the&s;e Ene|mies following, <HI>viz.</HI> the Moth, the Ear-wig, the Hornet, the Wa&s;p, the Swallow, and the Sparrow: of which, as well as of many other things relating to the Bees, tho&s;e, who de&s;ire farther Accounts, I refer to them who have di&s;tinctly treated of the&s;e In&s;ects, particularly to Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Warder</HI>'s <HI>True Amazons,</HI> or <HI>Monarchy of Bees.</HI> From which Treati&s;e I have extracted this Account of Bees; that Gentleman, from his nice, curious, and long Ob&s;ervations on this plea&s;ant, and no le&s;s profitable Subject, being thought to have di&s;cover'd more of the Nature, Pro|perties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Bees, than any that went before him. The Queen Bee is of all Bees the mo&s;t glorious. Her Body is much bigger and longer than that of the Honey-Bee: yet her Wings are no longer than the other's; which &s;hews, that &s;he is not de&s;ign'd for Labour, not long Flights, which is the continual Bu&s;ine&s;s of her Subjects. As to her Shape and Co|lour, her upper Parts are of a lighter brown than the re&s;t: her hinder Part from the Wa&s;te, (which is very &s;mall) as it is much longer than that of the Drone or Honey-Bee, &s;o is it much more taper than their$. And, whereas the Drone and Common Bee are brown all over the hinder Part, the Queen in that Part$i$ as black as Jet, or poli&s;h'd black Marble. And, whereas the two great Legs of the Commons are quite Black, hers are all as yellow as Gold, as al&s;o
<PB N="211" REF="214">&s;he is all along the under Part of the Belly. In &s;ort, the Queen doth as far &s;urpa&s;s her Subjects in Shape and Beauty, as the fine&s;t Hor&s;e does the com|mon F$rre&s;ter. And, as &s;he does far &s;urpa&s;s her Subjects in Shape and Beauty, &s;o &s;he al&s;o differs from them in Breeding. Fir&s;t, the Egg of her Royal Mother is ca&s;t into a Cell, made by her Va&s;&s;als for that very purpo&s;e, different from the re&s;t, being ex|actly round, much thicker in Wax, and the Cell, proportionably to her Body, much larger than tho&s;e the common Bees make for them&s;elves. But this round Palace is never among other Cells, but always by it &s;elf. No Monarch has a completer Submi&s;&s;ion from his Subjects, than the Queen-Bee from the common Bees. Bees &s;warms mo&s;t in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> tho' &s;ometime in <HI>April,</HI> and often in <HI>Ju|ly.</HI> There happen frequent and de&s;perate Wars a|mong&s;t the Bees, one Party &s;ometimes endeavouring to plunder another of its Honey; for which it will fight vigorou&s;ly: But, if it &s;hould &s;o happen, that the plunder'd Bees have lo&s;t their Queen, then they will &s;ide with the Robbers, and &s;uffer the Honey to be carried all out of their Hive. Sometimes Bees driven from their own Hives, and &s;eeking new Quarters, by that means occa&s;ion great Battles.</P>
<P N="14">14. THE SCORPION is an In&s;ect of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &amp;c. The coal black Scorpion is accounted the mo&s;t venemous; and is, both in thickne&s;s and length, a|bout the &s;ize of a Man's Finger. The Body &s;ome|what re&s;embles an Egg, and altogether is like a Craw-fi&s;h; only it has a blunter Head, and a le&s;s Body. It has eight-Legs, and two Claws. It has a long, knotted Tail, which Knots appear like &s;o ma|ny little Bladders; at the end of which it has a very venomous Sting. Some Scorpions are &s;aid to have two Stings in their Tails; and &s;ome to have venomous Teeth, with which they give a deadly B$te. It is reported, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> do not &s;leep in Ground Rooms, for fear of the&s;e Creatures. The mo&s;t general Cure again&s;t the Poi|&s;on of the&s;e In&s;ects, in tho&s;e Parts, is &s;aid to be a
