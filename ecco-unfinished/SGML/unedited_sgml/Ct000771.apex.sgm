<P>THE character of <HI>Sally</HI> (in which the little actre&s;s who performed it di&s;covered more than the dawn of theatrical genius) is an imitation of that of <HI>Babet,</HI> in the comedy of <HI>La Fau&s;&s;e Agn&egrave;s,</HI> by <HI>De&s;touches</HI>&mdash;and there are &s;ome traits of the character of <HI>Kitchen,</HI> in the 3d vol. of <HI>The CONNOISSEUR.</HI></P>

<P>No&mdash;I am in mourning, Sir, for a dear and worthy friend, and a mo&s;t valuable partner&mdash;a man, who&s;e goodne&s;s of heart was even &s;uperior to his admirable talents in his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Well, but George, now you have put on mourning for your friend, I am afraid you will

<P>I hope not, Sir&mdash;The publick is candid and generous; and we mu&s;t be attentive and indu&s;|trious.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>An innocent laugh, Sir&mdash;rai&s;ed out of an ad|venture which, I have taken the liberty to &s;up|po&s;e, happened during that period.&mdash;As to the Jubilee it&s;elf, or the de&s;ign and conduct of it, I cannot con&s;ider them as objects of &s;atire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir? they have been roundly attacked&mdash;Lodgings without beds&mdash;Dinners without victuals&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you mean, Sir.&mdash;My friend Pa$quin has infinite humour, but his plea&s;antries are exceedingly harmle&s;s, and I believe he wi&s;hes they &s;hould be &s;o.&mdash;The &s;candal of others is mere dirt&mdash;throw a great deal, and &s;ome of it will &s;tick. But the &s;atire of Pa&s;quin is like fuller's-earth&mdash;it daubs your coat indeed for a time&mdash;but it &s;oon grows dry; and when it rubs off, your coat is &s;o much the cleaner.&mdash;Thus it has happened on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion&mdash;for after all, gentlemen, if a building be erected for a particular purpo&s;e, is not it natural to pull it down again, when that pur|po&s;e is an&s;wered? A great number of people can|not
<PB N="4" REF="7">
be a&s;&s;embled without creating a croud&mdash;a rainy day will prevent the exhibition of a pageant&mdash;and heavy &s;howers de&s;troy the effect of a firework.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir&mdash;but an ode without poetry&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the ode&mdash;it had one capital fault, I mu&s;t confe&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY and JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;and what was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Gentlemen, I under&s;tood every word of it.&mdash;Now, an ode, they &s;ay&mdash;an ode&mdash;to be very good, &s;hould be wholly unintelligible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, your &s;ervant, Sir!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;but you intend to give it us here, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No&mdash;the ode can no where be heard to &s;o much advantage as from the mouth of the au|thor&mdash;and indeed it was &s;o happily calculated for the time and place, for which it was originally in|tended, and the &s;peaker &s;o truly felt a noble enthu|&s;ia&s;m on the occa&s;ion, that you have lo&s;t a very ex|qui&s;ite plea&s;ure (never to be retrieved) by not hearing it at Stratford-upon-Avon.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, Sir&mdash;but the pageant and the ma&s;|querace&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;but George&mdash;tell us a little of your comedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Walk in, Sir, and it will &s;peak for it&s;elf&mdash;The curtain is ju&s;t going to draw up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how do you feel your&s;elf?&mdash;Eh, George!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much as u&s;ual on &s;imilar occa&s;ions&mdash;all hurry and flutter&mdash;which &s;trangers are apt to mi&s;|take for high &s;pirits, and my friends and acquain|tance know to be nothing but apprehen&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>We'll give you a hand&mdash;I know of a &s;trong party again&s;t it, I can tell you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear no party, unle&s;s my own dulne&s;s rai&s;es one again&s;t me. The publick will &s;uffer no party, no malice, to interrupt its amu&s;ements.&mdash;If I &s;ucceed, I &s;hall owe my &s;ucce&s;s to their indulgence&mdash;if I fail, I &s;hall owe it to my&s;elf. With the&s;e &s;entiments I enter the theatre.&mdash;Come, Gen|tlemen&mdash;my trial is near coming on, for the play mu&s;t be ju&s;t going to begin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>We attend you, Sir.</P>
