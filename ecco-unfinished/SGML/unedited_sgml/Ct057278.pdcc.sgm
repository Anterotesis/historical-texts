<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I Should hardly have given the Reader the Trouble of a Preface, were it not to pay my Acknow|ledgment to the kind Performers, who, notwith&s;tanding the Hazard of being di&s;countenanc'd, are yet &s;o good-natur'd once more to venture in this Dangerous Road, purely with the friendly De&s;ire of a&s;&s;i&s;ting my Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>We all join'd in this Belief, That I was below the Notice of the Criticks, and therefore hop'd I might e&s;cape their Cen|&s;ure. I own, Poetry is a thing I little un|der&s;tand; yet &s;hould I meet a better Fate than po&s;&s;ibly I may de&s;erve, I &s;hall grate|fully acknowledge my &s;elf oblig'd to the
<PB REF="4">
generous Town for their Indulgence, but never arrogate to my &s;elf any Merit thereon.</P>
<P>This Attempt being begun &s;oon after the Run of the Celebrated <HI>Beggar</HI>'s <HI>Opera</HI> (to mention which gives me &s;ome Confu|&s;ion, while I am &s;peaking of my own weak Endeavours) the Reader may perhaps find &s;ome few Tunes &s;ince made u&s;e of in other Entertainments of this Kind. I mu&s;t de|clare the Songs thereto were made before I ever &s;aw any &s;uch Performances&mdash;and had Lei&s;ure permitted me, I had alter'd 'em &mdash;Such as it is, I throw it on the Mercy of its Auditors.</P>

<L>OUR <HI>humble</HI> Bard (well he de&s;erves that Name,</L>

<L>Seeing your <HI>modern</HI> Opera's &s;pring &s;o thick,</L>
<L>Thought <HI>Sing-&s;ong ea&s;ie</HI> as a <HI>Juggler</HI>'s <HI>Trick</HI>.</L>
<L>Building on <HI>This,</HI> and con&s;cious of no Skill,</L>
<L>He gives You <HI>his</HI> A&s;&s;ay, of pure good Will.</L>
<L>Since he pleads <HI>guilty, wink</HI> at <HI>one</HI> Offence:</L>
<L><HI>Mercy</HI> has oft reclaim'd to <HI>&s;ober Sen&s;e</HI>.</L>
<L>He likes the Trade <HI>&s;o ill,</HI> as a <HI>Beginner,</HI></L>
<L>He &s;wears, he ne'er &s;hall grow a <HI>harden'd</HI> Sinner:</L>
<L>Unle&s;s&mdash;Heav'n help him! &mdash; <HI>Wit</HI> &s;hould turn his Brain;</L>

<L>And <HI>fiddle</HI> to his <HI>own Extravagance</HI>.</L>
<L>Tho',&mdash;&s;hould <HI>That</HI> happen, he might plead &s;ome <HI>Merit;</HI></L>
<L>What <HI>once</HI> was <HI>Madne&s;s, now</HI> is <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI>.</L>
<L>But, <HI>yet,</HI> poor Soul! he claims not <HI>that proud</HI> Bays,</L>
<L>You'll <HI>under&s;tand</HI> him,&mdash;tho' you &s;hould not <HI>prai&s;e</HI>.</L>
<L>For <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> who&s;e <HI>doubtful</HI> Fate it is to be</L>

<L>Nor <HI>more,</HI> nor <HI>le&s;s,</HI> than what <HI>He prompts</HI> 'em to.</L>
<L>Then, 'faith, be kind;&mdash;you've had your Treat of <HI>Wit;</HI></L>
