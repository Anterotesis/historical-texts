<HEAD>TO THE
Right Honourable Sidney Lord
Godolphin, Lord High Trea|&s;urer
of England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THE Author of the&s;e is none of tho&s;e numerous Attendants,
which the envious Party &s;ays</HI> Wait at your levee, and
pay Homage to the Profits, they expect from your
Power.</P>
<P>As the&s;e envy your Lord&s;hip that Tru&s;t, which the Nation
in general, &s;ees your Lord&s;hip di&s;charge with an Integrity equal,
and Succe&s;s beyond all that ever went before you. So, pardon me,
my Lord, to &s;ay, The humble Author of the&s;e Sheets, wholly
unknown to your Lord&s;hip, &s;haded by his Ob&s;curity, from the
Sun-&s;hine of your Bounty, and in no Expectation of Reward,
thinks your Lord&s;hips Defence &s;o much his Duty, in Gratitude
as an Engli&s;h Man, and in Return for his &s;hare in common,
with the re&s;t of his Country, of the Ble&s;&s;ings receiv'd from
your exqui&s;ite Management of the Nations Trea&s;ure, that he
could not &s;ee you attack'd with &s;o much In&s;olence, without ex|po&s;ing
that Spirit of Malignity that &s;o much reigns at your
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
Lord&s;hip and the whole Government, in a Party who&s;e whole
Complaint is, that they are thrown out of a Tru&s;t they had no
Temper or Bounds, in the Di&s;charge of; and from which,
nothing but their Re&s;olutions to ruine us all, could have di&s;|plac'd
them.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip, however, has the Satisfaction to be thus
treated in very good Company: Her Maje&s;ty has a double
Portion of the Rage of this Party thrown upon Her Royal
Conduct; The Moderation of the Queen is fir&s;t $ria$$uled
and abu&s;ed, and Her Maje&s;ty is then &s;aid, <HI>with an unpara|lell'd
In&s;olence,</HI> to be wean'd from the Church; and that the
Church does not &s;tand in the &s;ame Rank, in Her E&s;teem, as it
formerly did.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops are charg'd with being Traytors to the Church
and the Sacred Office, di&s;charg'd from being a Signature of
a True Church-man.</P>
<P>The whole Hou&s;e of Lords are &s;aid to bully the Commons
with Things which they have nothing to do with.</P>
<P>All the Loyal Church of <HI>England</HI> Men in the Nation, that
are not for <HI>The &s;horte&s;t Way with the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> in the
Litteral Sen&s;e, are Abettors of a Faction.</P>
<P>Thus, my Lord, the Nation is in&s;ulted by a Party, or at
lea&s;t, by a &s;roward Author, who writes in the Name of a
Party, and who&s;e Book the Party are far from di&s;ou$ing.
And, to &s;um up all; He brings them up to the Face of the
Government, and threatens the Re&s;entment of the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">
It has often been &s;aid, in Behalf of the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and that even by this Party, That her Loyalty is &s;uch, &s;he
cannot be provok'd to Rebellion: A certain &s;ign the&s;e Gentle|men
are not of that Church, when they tell your Lord&s;hip and
the Government, P. 12. &startq;The Principles of the Church of
<HI>England</HI> will di&s;po&s;e Men to bear a great deal, but he is a
mad Man that will try how much; and that Nature is apt
to rebell again&s;t Principle.&endq;</P>
<P>From hence it would &s;eem a ju&s;t Enquiry to be made of
the&s;e Gentlemen, what Church they mean, &s;ince it cannot be
meant of the Prote&s;tant Church of <HI>England,</HI> even by their
own Principles, If of the Prote&s;tant Church of <HI>England</HI> they
&s;peak, when they complain of the Danger arriv'd to Her, by turning
the <HI>D</HI> of <HI>B</HI>&mdash;my Lord <HI>R</HI>&mdash;and my Lord <HI>N</HI>&mdash;it might not
be improper to enquire what mighty Things tho&s;e noble Lords
ever did for the Church, and what the Church has &s;uffer'd by
their mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>My Lord, 'tis hop'd your Lord&s;hip and the Government, who
were not ignorant of the Temper of this Party, when you &s;hew'd you
dur&s;t di&s;arm them of their Power, will equally contemn their
Threatning and Buffoonry, while di&s;arm'd and appearing unfit
to be tru&s;ted they &s;hew their Teeth, &s;narle at the Power they
mi&s;improv'd, and attempt to bully your Lord&s;hip with their
impotent R$$$$tment.</P>
<P>The Queen, my Lord and the Government, have nothing to
fear from the&s;e Men. <HI>Like the Devil,</HI> their Rage is great,
becau&s;e their T$ne is &s;hort. Murther, Trea&s;on, and A&s;a&s;&s;ina|$$$$
they once fled to in the late Reign, and
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
found their Reward at the Gallows, where all the Satisfaction
they could have, was to have one High-Church Man ab&s;olve an|other,
and own that tho&s;e behind, had as much Hand in the
Guilt as tho&s;e that went before.</P>
<P>God Almighty, we tru&s;t, will protect the Queen from the
bloody De&s;igns of exa&s;perated mad Men; and as for their
Re&s;entment as a Party, I am per&s;waded your Lord&s;hip &s;leeps
in quiet, and cannot but do &s;o, while admini&s;tring your high
Tru&s;t with &s;o equal a Hand, &s;o faithful to the Queen, and &s;o &s;a|tisfactory
to the People. Your Lord&s;hip has the Satisfaction
to &s;ee, That not one Man either&punc; envys or complains, but in
the Behalf of a Party, who&s;e chief Di&s;content ari&s;es from the
Lo&s;s of that Power they knew not how to manage, had neither
Temper enough to execute, nor Moderation enough to bear the
Lo&s;s of.</P>

<P>THat no Age can paralell the Moderation of the pre&s;ent Go|vernment,
the Contempt of &s;narling Enemies, their
Di&s;regard of Slander and intolerable In&s;olence, are Te&s;timonyes
be yound Exception.</P>
<P>The Daily In&s;ults of a Party, which the Government may,
and which &s;ome think they ought to re&s;ent, are mo&s;t un|accountable.</P>
<P>The Loo&s;e the hot Men of this Party give to their
Tongues, even in the mo&s;t Sacred Place the Church, the
Sacred Office of the Pulpit; and their common Di&s;cour&s;e is
&s;uch, as no Government but this, would ever bear with; a
clear and apparent Proof that the Queen and the Mini&s;try,
act by tho&s;e Principles of Temper and Moderation, that they
at the &s;ame Time per&s;wade the Nation to.</P>
<P>But, as if the Party were re&s;olved to try the Extent of Royal
Patience, and &s;ee, how long the Queen may be in&s;ulted, and
<PB N="2" REF="7">
the Government ridicul'd, before Her Maje&s;ty can be provok'd
to &s;hew her ju&s;t Re&s;entment &s;uch U&s;age calls for. We have
now publi&s;h'd a Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>The Memorial of the
Church of England. Humbly offered to the Con&s;ideration of all
true Lovers of our Church and Con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>To pre&s;ent the Reader with the Heads of this Tract, full
of Words, full of horrible Sugge&s;tions, and mo&s;t barbarous
Treatment, both of the Queen, the Mini&s;try, and the Diffenters,
would be to an&s;wer it Paragraph by Paragraph, a Thing too
tedious, and too big for this &s;mall Tract; but as the mo&s;t
&s;ignificant Part of it is reduceable to a few Heads, I &s;hall
give a &s;hort Abridgment of the Sub&s;tance, and then &s;peak to
the Whole, as a Thing all of a Piece, with &s;ome other De|&s;igns
of the Party, expre&s;s'd in different manner.</P>
<P>The whole Book is a virulent Exclamation again&s;t the Go|vernment;
a meer <HI>Church Legion.</HI> The Stile, gro&s;s and unman|nerly,
fill'd with all that Vehemence and Gall, that a Party
(who in Place were furious, and out of Place Revengeful)
could be imagin'd to be fill'd with.</P>
<P>The Subject of this Libel is, <HI>The Danger of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>The Foundation of that, the Author places in the Turn of
the Court, and Change of the great Officers.</P>
<P>The In&s;truments of this Change are call'd,</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Mini&s;try; and particularly, The Lord Trea&s;urer,
Duke of <HI>Marlbro'</HI> and his Dutche&s;s.</P>

<P>The&s;e are loaded with infamous Terms, horrid Sugge&s;tions,
pre&s;umptive In&s;inuations, Facts unprov'd, a long and black
Charge of Corruption, and De&s;igns to overthrowthe Con&s;titution;
<PB N="3" REF="8">
all the Evils of our Affairs, abroad and at home, are laid at their
Door, as Enemies to their Country, and De&s;troyers of the
Church; and at la&s;t they are openly threatned with the Churches
Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>He begins with what he calls&punc; <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the Di&s;&s;enters
Carriage towards the Church;</HI> a&s;&s;erting po&s;itive and premeditated
Fal&s;hoods.</P>
<P>&startq;1. That at the Death of King <HI>William</HI> they were ready
to have thrown a Blank to the Church, and would have taken
a general Indemnity, with an Exclu&s;ion from all publick
Tru&s;t and Office.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;2. That not a Month before, they breathed nothing but
Defiance, in&s;ulted the Church, and treated the Prince&s;s
with the mo&s;t &s;candalous Indignities: That now, they
preach nothing but Charity, Peace, Love, Forgivene&s;s of
Injuries, Oblivion of Wrongs, and the utter Extinction of
Parties for ever; &s;o very good and gracious can Men in
Fear be.&endq;</P>
<P>Really, if a Man were to mea&s;ure the Danger of the Church
a&s;&s;erted in this Book, by this Relation, and the Truth of the fir&s;t was
to be judged by the Truth of the la&s;t, the Controver&s;y might
&s;oon end.</P>
<P>If the Di&s;&s;enters were in this pickle, at the Death of the late
King, pray Gentlemen, come forth and make good this Charge.</P>
<P>What were the Crimes they had commited, for which they
wanted Indemnity?</P>
<P>You &s;ay their own Con&s;ciences, P. 5. prompted them to &s;eek
Pardon and Peace&mdash;Pray, who did they &s;eek it for, and who
were the Per&s;ons they &s;ought it of?&mdash;'Tis very &s;trange and
wonderful, the&s;e Criminals that wou'd have thrown the Church
a Blank, were neither Pardon'd nor Puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>We read of no Act of Indemnity, in Her Maje&s;ty's Reign; the
Church never offer'd to grant it, and the Diffenters had no oc|ca&s;ion
to ask it: 'Tis very hard to find out what the Crimes were
<PB N="4" REF="9">
the Di&s;&s;enters had Commited, that they were in &s;uch pain
about, and how their Fears came to be blown over.</P>
<P>Well, but &s;ays this <HI>Legeon</HI> Author, in the very next Para|graph;
<HI>They found the Head of the Church, and after her Example,
the Members too, enclin'd to forgive,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> With all humble Deference to Her Maje&s;ty's Clemency,
the Di&s;&s;enters think them&s;elves happy, in endeavouring
to merit Her Maje&s;ty's Protection, and value them&s;elves,
in having hitherto avoided coming into any Condition, which
&s;hould make them fly to Her Mercy.</P>
<P>Forgivene&s;s in a Prince, implyes Guilt in the Subject: Now,
with all the Re&s;pect to the Publck Ju&s;tice Immaginable, I mu&s;t
&s;ay, where there is no Guilt there is no Need of Forgivene&s;s.
The Di&s;&s;enters cannot be thought to le&s;&s;en her Maje&s;ty's Mer|cy,
by in&s;i&s;ting upon their Innocence, and not &s;eeking any Par|don
'till they are convicted of a Crime.</P>
<P>&startq;But they in&s;ulted the Church, and abu&s;ed the Prince&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>To this the Di&s;&s;enters mu&s;t plead, Not guilty too; and de|mand
who are the Men, let them be brought forth, let them
come to Ju&s;tice, it is not yet too late; we de&s;ire they may re|ceive
no Mercy: And on the other Hand, we demand, If two
Earls, often thus named among the Li&s;t of the Church's
Friends&mdash;which <HI>N</HI>&mdash;and <HI>R</HI>&mdash;did not u&s;e the <HI>Queen</HI>
as ill, during the la&s;t Reign, as any Per&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Thus, the Great Foundation Charge again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters,
&s;tands upon a Column of Fal&s;hood and Forgery; and by exa|mining
into the Truth of Fact <HI>falls to the Ground of it &s;elf.</HI> And
the fourth and fifth Pages of this Book are plea&s;ed to impo&s;e
three point blank Fal&s;ities, that have no Colour for them, but
in the Malignant Humour of the Relater.</P>
<P>And 'tis a great Felicity to the Nation and Government,
that the pre&s;ent inveterate Malice of the high Party, is oblig'd
to fly to <HI>a Refuge of Lyes</HI> for its Support, impo&s;ing po&s;itive
Contradictions in Defence of Erroneous Sugge&s;tions.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="10">
Again, &s;ays this fal&s;e Accu&s;er, &startq;The Di&s;&s;enters, as &s;oon as
they found the <HI>Queen</HI> gave them A&s;&s;urances and comfortable
Speeches, return'd to their Former In&s;olences and Pre&s;um|ption.&endq;</P>
<P>All this is &s;till beg'd, here's no Proof of Fact, nor
indeed can there be; the Per&s;on, or Examples are not brought
to light; and the&s;e bold A&s;&s;ertions remain ab&s;olutely unprov'd.</P>
<P>From this Hi&s;tory of the Di&s;&s;enters Carriage, not one Word
of which hath had the Good Fortune to be true: The Memorial
proceeds to tell us of, &startq;<HI>The Advances which have been made in their
Favour,</HI> and <HI>Repul&s;es the Church has met with,</HI> all Attempts
to &s;ettle it having been oppo&s;ed, and rendered ineffectual.&endq;</P>
<P>And who is all this done by? Who has given the Church &s;o
many Repul&s;es? Who made Advances to the Di&s;&s;enters, and
oppo&s;ed the Settlement of the Church?</P>
<P>The Per&s;ons charg'd, in this black Li&s;t are, The <HI>Queen,</HI> and
My Lord Trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>And a bold and in&s;olent Sugge&s;tion is made, that the Mem|bers,
who have places, hold them of my Lord <HI>T</HI>&mdash;, by this
Tenure, <HI>viz.</HI> To vote again&s;t the Church.</P>
<P>The <HI>Queen</HI> is then charg'd with turning out the E&mdash;of
<HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> Sr. <HI>E&mdash;S</HI>&mdash;, the E. of <HI>N</HI>&mdash;, and the E. of <HI>R</HI>&mdash;,
only becau&s;e their Con&s;ciences made them adhere &s;teadily to
the Intere&s;t of the Church.</P>
<P>Nor is this all the In&s;ult offered the <HI>Queen,</HI> but P. 6, 7. Her
Maje&s;ty is brought in, putting the Church out of her Favour,
that &s;he might keep the D&mdash;ke and Dutche&s;s of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, in her
Favour, wean'd from the Church, and &s;uffering all that ad|hered
firmly to the Church, to be driven from her Favour.</P>
<P>All the&s;e In&s;olences are &s;ugge&s;ted of the <HI>Queen</HI> and Mini&s;try,
to introduce the Picture of Moderation; and this they draw as
mon&s;trous as they can make it: in the <HI>Queen</HI> They call it
<PB N="6" REF="11">
Partiality for the Diffenters, and boldly affirm, P. 8. That
<HI>&startq;the Church does not hold the &s;ame Rank, in the</HI> Queen's <HI>E&s;teem
and Confidence, that it held heretofore: That Her Maje&s;ty
was fill'd with Apprehen&s;ions of the Mi&s;chicvous Heat and
Pa&s;&s;ion of the C&mdash;Men.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>In this, Manner for about twenty &s;ix Pages, this Mon&s;trous
Libel goes on to expo&s;e the <HI>Queen</HI> and her Mini&s;try, as Ene|mies
to the Church, all along intermixing Threatnings of the
Church's Re&s;entments and calling to Account for the&s;e Things;
buffoons my Lord Trea&s;urer, as triming again&s;t his Principle; in|&s;ults
the <HI>Queen</HI> as aw'd by her Mini&s;try, and not daring to &s;hew
her Di&s;like, repre&s;ents the Di&s;&s;enters as ru&s;hing into the Royal
Favour; upbraids the Mini&s;iry with &s;piriting up a Faction, and
making them pretend to the whole Power, who were &s;o de|pre&s;s'd,
that they would have purchas'd Impunity, with In|capacity;
charging them with di&s;obliging the be&s;t Hou&s;e of
<HI>C&mdash;ns</HI> that ever any Prince had, and from an idle Jealou&s;y of
&s;ome Lords ri&s;ing in the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Favour, courting and truck|ling
to the Lord <HI>Wh&mdash;Somers</HI> and <HI>H&mdash;fax,</HI> who requite
them with Contempt.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops, the Hou&s;e of Lords, and all the Gentry of
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> tho' never &s;o con&s;tant in her Com|munion,
and loyal to her Principles, that cannot come up to
the Intemperance and Zeal of this Party, come in for a Share
of their Reproaches: And at la&s;t, 'tis all &s;um'd up, P. 26. Thus,
the pre&s;ent pro&s;pect of the <HI>C&mdash;ch</HI> is very melancholyand &s;o is
that al&s;o of the Government, <HI>&amp;c</HI></P>
<P>From this Period, the Book proceeds to a Satyr upon Mode|ration&mdash;and
Abundance of fal&s;e and unaccountable A&s;&s;ertions;
which indeed, give the Book &s;ome Di&s;advantage, as Lyes al|ways
do, to any Cau&s;e, and which we &s;hall endeavour to de|tect.</P>
<P>Several Pages run on to examin the Impotencies of an Act of
Comprehen&s;ion, and then addre&s;&s;ing to the Moderate Clergy
of the C&mdash;of <HI>England,</HI> comes on an Offer to yeild, in Mat|ters
of Ceremony, to the Di&s;&s;enters, but at the &s;ame Time
tells them, it will notbe accepted.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">
As this is a Horrible In&s;olence in offering that in the Name of
the <HI>C.</HI> of <HI>E.</HI> which the <HI>C.</HI> has always refus'd, and which there can
be no Legal Authority to offer, it is a Mine laid for the Offence of
the Di&s;&s;enters, but breaks out backward, to the &s;haking the Repu|tation
of the whole Book, di&s;covers the Authors of it not to be of
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;peaks without Book, and as they &s;ay what
they cannot prove, &s;o they propo&s;e what they cannot perform.</P>
<P>From hence the Book runs on to in&s;ult the Lords in the Ca&s;e
of the <HI>Aylesbury</HI> Men, and &s;o &s;ets up in Defence, as it is call'd, of
the Rights and Privileges of the Commons. To this I &s;hall not
offer any thing, the Rea&s;ons of the Lords having &s;ufficiently done
it, and the Brevity of the&s;e Papers not admitting it.</P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion of the Book is a Defence of the Tackers; and
this is done with a Mixture of In&s;ults and Threatnings, how and
in what manner it &s;hall be attempted in the next Parliament,
and in Explicit Terms, telling the Queen, She &s;hall have no Mo|ney
till 'tis pa&s;t, and threaten the Con&s;equences lying on tho&s;e
that refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the In&s;olence of this Book is Unaccountable and Intol|lerable:
If the Authors and Publi&s;hers of it go Unpuni&s;h'd, the
Government mu&s;t expect yet greater In&s;ults than the&s;e, and tho'
<HI>except</HI> in more <HI>Coventry</HI> Tumults, 'tis hardly po&s;&s;ible; yet, all
that can be the Con&s;equence of &s;uch In&s;olence, ought to be expe|cted,
if this way of treating Governments be not &s;uppre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Who the Author of &s;uch a rank Excur&s;ion mu&s;t be, is not for
me to determine. Sometimes 'tis call'd <HI>&V;s,</HI> &s;peaking of the Cler|gy;
&s;ometimes <HI>&V;s,</HI> &s;peaking of the Hou&s;e of Commons: Some|times
the <HI>Spectre</HI> appears in one Shape, &s;ometimes in another. All
I can in$er is, and I think it &s;eems to be the Sen&s;e they would
have the Book be under&s;tood in, that it is a Conjunction of Sediti|ous
Heads laid together, &s;ome of the Church, &s;ome of the State,
&s;ome in the late Hou&s;e, &s;ome out of it, and &s;o may pa&s;s as before,
for the Party's <HI>Legion,</HI> the Church's <HI>Scandalous</HI> Club; for &s;ure no|thing
&s;o Extravagant, nothing &s;o Abominable, nothing &s;o Un|&s;eemly,
&s;o Di&s;loyal, Di&s;re&s;pectful or Undutiful, ever came from
the Church of <HI>England</HI> to Her Sovereign.</P>
<P>In order to con&s;ider this Inveterate Excur&s;ion, this Flux of
High-Church Choler, with a little more Temper than is &s;hewn
<PB N="8" REF="13">
in its own Method, I &s;hall begin to &s;tate the Ca&s;e a little fairly,
and I hope unexceptionably between us, which I take to be the
true&s;t Method to come at the Deci&s;ion, and if po&s;&s;ible, the end of
this Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>If in doing this, I am oblig'd to be free with &s;ome Per&s;ons,
who&s;e Quality demands &s;ome more Re&s;pect than their Integrity,
tho' &s;ome may object again&s;t it, yet the Authors of this Book
cannot, who&s;e Indecencies even to their Sovereign mu&s;t &s;top their
Mouths, and wholly incapacitate them from being Cen&s;urers of
Manners.</P>
<P>As the Memorial begins with the fir&s;t of this Reign, &s;o mu&s;t I.
When the High-Church Party had di&s;gorg'd them&s;elves of their
re&s;train'd Spleen in mo&s;t extravagant In&s;ults and Triumphs on
the Death of King <HI>William,</HI> when they had with unparallell'd
In&s;olence upbraided and in&s;ulted the Whigs with their certain
approaching De&s;truction, when Down with the Phanaticks,
Down with the Presbyterians, Down with the Meeting-Hou&s;es,

out of Breath with it. The fir&s;t Heat of their Joy being a lit|tle
over, they fell diligently to work, to put in Practice what
was always in their Hearts to do; and what they began to
think, <HI>now,</HI> was the only Opportunity to bring to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>If any Man will debate with me the Matter of Fact, and

The&s;e Things are not worth naming here; but to introduce
this General, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Party having been di&s;appointed in
the late King, who&s;e Immoderate Clemency even to them&s;elves
was his greate&s;t Mi&s;take, and counting all his (to them redious)
Reign a Re&s;traint to 'em from the old Temper of Per&s;ecution
and De&s;truction, which ever &s;ince the Re&s;toration they had
breath'd out again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, they thought at the Coming
of the Queen to the Throne, their Time was come.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty at Her fir&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, as a full De|mon&s;tration
of Her Sincere Affection to the Church and to all
its mo&s;t Zealous and Pious Members, and firmly believing
the Sincerity of the&s;e Church-Men to be equal to their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
put Her Self and the Nation wholly into their
Hands.</P>
<P>When Her Maje&s;ty did this, it was with &s;uch a Declaration of
Her true De&s;ign for the Good of all Her Subjects, that had the&s;e
Gentlemen had the lea&s;t Fore&s;ight of Things, had they weigh'd
the Ju&s;tice, the Candour, the Prudence and Piety of the Queen,
had they con&s;ider'd the Publick Good, the Means of obtaining a
happy Conclu&s;ion of Troubles Abroad, and avoiding the Embar|ra&s;ment
of Parties at Home, they could not have imagin'd Her
Maje&s;ty could entertain Thoughts equally De&s;tructive of any part
of Her Subjects to what they had &s;uppos'd.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Matters were hid from their Eyes; the Fury of
their Party-Zeal &s;o unhappily hood wink'd their Politicks, that
they could &s;ee nothing before them. So far had their eager Thir&s;t
after the Ruin of their Brethren blinded them to their own Intere&s;t,
that they &s;uffer'd nothing to &s;tand in their Way, but filling their
Mouths with the Church, the Church, like the Cry of <HI>Diana</HI> of
the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> they run on with this Extreme, That <HI>nothing could
procure the Safety of the Church, but the De&s;truction of the Di&s;|&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Shock this Warmth met with, was from a &s;mall,
but incon&s;iderable Difference between Men, who, tho' of the
&s;ame Principle as to the Di&s;&s;enters, yet of a di&s;&s;erent Intere&s;t as
to Politicks, happen'd to cla&s;h in their De&s;ign.</P>

High-Church Complying Clergy.</P>

The fir&s;t of the&s;e were in hopes of &s;ome Turn in Favour of
their old Ma&s;ter's Po&s;terity, and at lea&s;t expected from the Queen,
that the Right of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> &s;hould be Recogniz'd, and
that Her Maje&s;ty enjoying the Crown for Life, &s;hould re&s;tore it
as to the right Owner after Her Decea&s;e.</P>
<P>It was thought mo&s;t of our High Church-Men would have
come into this Project, but when they began to Examine it, it
&s;truck &s;o directly at Her Maje&s;ty's Right of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that they
&s;aw it was to no purpo&s;e to attempt it; and tho&s;e Lords, who
they had the Face to move it to, pre&s;ently Objected it would be
to acknowledge Her Maje&s;ty an U&s;urper, and at be&s;t to bring
the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to be the right Heir, only lending the
Crown to his Si&s;ter for Life, with a Re&s;erve to him&s;elf and his
Heirs.</P>
<P>This being an irreconcileable Difficulty, gave the fir&s;t Killing-Wound
to the Party, which appear'd United and Formidable be|fore;
for now all the Jacobite-Party fell off, and Rail'd at the
Queen as an U&s;urper, ju&s;t as they did before at the King.</P>
<P>This Nece&s;&s;ity of Owning the Queen's `Right to depend upon
the Revolution Settlement, drove the High-Church-Men all to a
yet wor&s;e Extream, and that was to fall in with the <HI>Hannover</HI>
Succe&s;&s;ion, confirm'd with an Abjuration.</P>
<P>This lo&s;t them yet more of their Friends, and &s;o weakened
their Party farther.</P>
<P>The&s;e Steps, which indeed the Nature of Things more than
the Inclination of the&s;e People led them to, brought them gradu|ally
to &s;ee the open De&s;igns of the Jacobite-Party; and the Con|&s;equence
was plain, That if the Queen &s;at on the Throne by
the Right of Parliament Limitation, which was the Effect of
King <HI>William</HI> and the Revolution, all tho&s;e Parties who were
Enemies to the King and the Revolution, could not but be
Enemies to the Queen's Intere&s;t, and the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Han|nover.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Church and the Di&s;&s;enters were found to have but
one and the &s;ame Civil Intere&s;t, whatever their Religious Inte|re&s;t
might &s;eem to be.</P>
<P>This was &s;uch a Choak-Pear to this High-Party, who, in their

out of all manner of Bounds.</P>

upon the Family of <HI>Hannover,</HI> whom on all occa&s;ions they have
repre&s;ented as no Friends to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> before they
know them.</P>
<P>It may &s;uffice, that they di&s;cover'd the&s;e Di&s;contents upon all
Occa&s;ions; and as the Mini&s;tery was wholly in the&s;e Hands,
the Fury of their Proceedings, the Ends they aim'd at, and the
Means they propos'd for it, di&s;cover'd them&s;elves &s;o, that it ju&s;t|ly
gave Offence to the Queen, and to all tho&s;e of the Nobility and
Gentry that had any Compa&s;&s;ion for their Native Country, and
who had Wi&s;dom to &s;ee the Tendency of tho&s;e unhappy Mea|&s;ures,

Foundation in general, <HI>viz.</HI> to E&s;tabli&s;h the Nation's Security upon
the ble&s;&s;ed Mean, between all the&s;e Extreams, and Build up the
Nation's Safety upon the Heavenly Foundation of Party, Peace

<P>The Queen, who far from any Thoughts &s;o Barbarous as the&s;e

Her A&s;&s;urance to them, That the Toleration Act &s;hould

<P>Not all the Faithful Di&s;charge of a difficult Office, not the re|covering

<P>But Succe&s;s &s;anctify'd the Action, and Heaven that &s;aw

<P>From this &s;hort Hi&s;tory, which indeed tho' exactly true in
Fact, is but an Ab&s;tract of tho&s;e Things. I draw the&s;e Conclu|&s;ions,
which I humbly Recommend to the Con&s;ideration of our
High-Church-Complainants.</P>
<P>That neither the Queen nor a &s;elect Mini&s;try, has Di&s;plac'd
the&s;e Gentlemen, but <HI>Them&s;elves,</HI> their own fiery furious Mea|&s;ures.
And how can the Authors of this Pamphlet, &s;ay, <HI>They
were Con&s;cious to them&s;elves of no intemperate Behaviour.</HI> p. 8. Will
they join I&s;&s;ue upon that Point? Let their Parliamentary Debates,
their Conference Speeches, their, Sermons Pamphlets, Di&s;cour&s;es,
their Cabinet Mea&s;ures; let them be brought on the Stage, and
the World will &s;oon Determine whether they were Guilty of any
Intemperate Behaviour or no.</P>
<P>Nor has the Lord Trea&s;urer or the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> much
le&s;s the Queen, yet le&s;s the Bi&s;hops, abandon'd the Church. All
Men know my Lord Trea&s;urer remote from a Di&s;&s;enter, or from
that you call a Whig; that he was always &s;o in Principle: Nay,
them&s;elves own it, for while they call the Queen a Whig and the
Bi&s;hops Presbyterians, my Lord comes under another Scandal of a
Trimmer.</P>
<P>Now Gentlemen, if you will run up to &s;uch Exce&s;s that no
wi&s;e Man can go with you, who can you blame? My Lord
<PB N="14" REF="19">
Trea&s;urer has not left the Church, but You have driven him from
You in Defence of the Church: You have forc'd him from You
becau&s;e He would not be Mad.</P>
<P>What could el&s;e make a Church of <HI>England</HI> Queen? The
Church of <HI>England</HI> Bi&s;hops and above three Fourths of a Church
Nobility &s;tand at a Di&s;tance from you.</P>
<P>If Men will be Mad, they mu&s;t not expect to be joyn'd by
tho&s;e that remain in their Wits; the Queen, the Bi&s;hops,
the Moderate Clergy, the Peers, the Gentry, are they all Con|verted
to Phanatici&s;m, or are You turn'd Lunaticks of ano|ther
Kind?</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;hort is, this happy Conjunction, is &s;eeking
the Church's Safety one Way, and You another.</P>
<P>'Tis agreed the Church is in Danger, and I joyn with You,
that the Pro&s;pect of the Church is very Melancholy; but I differ
in the Circum&s;tance. The Danger of the Church is from You,
that would Enflame Her, Embroil Her with Parties, Rai&s;e a
Civil Feud in Her Bowels, and place Her in <HI>I&s;hmael</HI>'s Circum|&s;tance,
with Her Hand up again&s;t every Body, and every Bo|dy's
Hand again&s;t Her.</P>
<P>Now the Queen, and the Mini&s;try, and the Bi&s;hops, and
Moderate Clergy, who are all known to be &s;teddy Adherers
to the Church, are on one &s;ide, and the High-Church-Men
on the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;eeking the Church's Safety in the Nation's Peace;
You in Per&s;ecution, Oppre&s;&s;ion and Ruin of your Neighbours;
and becau&s;e You will have the&s;e Extremes to be the Mea&s;ures,
the Government, who cannot be convinc'd of the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s
of your Way, have laid You by, and re&s;olve to go on
their Way. Now the Que&s;tion is, Whether Peace or Per&s;ecu|tion
be the be&s;t Way to E&s;tabli&s;h the Church.</P>
<P>To get off of this Difficulty, the Party never found a ready
Way till now; and this Author has hit of it, <HI>The Churches Danger.</HI>
But the Misfortune of it is, that the Thing would be a very Effe|ctual
Proof, only that it happens to be fal&s;e in Fact, and no Body
but an Author with &s;uch a Face could po&s;&s;ibly advance &s;uch a

contrary to the Principles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the
Chri&s;tian Religion.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>But to come off of this, this Memorial declares, p. 35.</HI> If the
parting with a few Ceremonies in the Form of our Wor&s;hip would
Reconcile and &V;nite them &s;incerely to our Church, we are ready to Sa|crifice
them to their Scruples. Let them &s;tate their Demands: <HI>Im|pudent
Forgery! Was ever any thing like this?</HI></P>
<P>Would the Church have Sacrific'd a few Ceremonies to the
Scruples of the Di&s;&s;enters, there had been at this Day but few
Di&s;&s;enters; all the Heads of their Mini&s;ters, all the principal
Leaders of their Numbers had Conform'd at fir&s;t. And 'tis
apparent, that when their Demands were &s;tated, and it was re|fer'd
to Bi&s;hop&mdash;his An&s;wer was, <HI>That the Church would part
with none of her Ceremonies.</HI></P>
<P>Well, but now you will.&mdash;How does this appear? Who
is it that makes the Offer, and calls upon the Di&s;&s;enters to make
their Demands? Is it the Church? Will they make an Order of
Convocation? Shall there be a &s;econd Conference, and &s;hall it be
with more Sincerity than the fir&s;t?</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee a &s;tated Authority before us which the Church will
&s;tand by, ready to make &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ions to really &s;crupulous Con|&s;ciences,
and ready to abate what &s;hall appear rea&s;onable to be
abated; and it will &s;oon appear, whether the Di&s;&s;enters, at lea&s;t
in &s;uch Numbers as would make your Occa&s;ional Bill u&s;ele&s;s,
would not come over to You.</P>
<P>As this therefore is the only way to An&s;wer the Di&s;&s;enters, &s;o
this Memorial takes hold of the crafty Part of the Argument,
and makes a right U&s;e of it: But where is the Call let us &s;ee it?
Done! There &s;hall be no need of a Call for the Demands, they
will be ready Made and Defended.</P>
<P>But then &s;ays the Author, it mu&s;t be from the whole Body:
This is another Fallacy, pre&s;uming great Numbers will not come
into it.</P>
<P>I believe not &s;uch Numbers would come into it, as would have
done at the <HI>Savoy</HI> Conference; but I believe 100000 Families of
<PB N="16" REF="21">
Di&s;&s;enters would come into it, if the Conce&s;&s;ions were Chri&s;tian
and Sincere.</P>
<P>But let me tell the Gentlemen of the High Church, this cannot
be their Sen&s;e, and that in particular proves it a Pre&s;umption
in the Author of this Legion.</P>
<P>For &s;hould the Church of <HI>England</HI> by Conce&s;&s;ion of her indif|ferent
Things, open a Door for all tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters to come in,
who could comply; as the&s;e new Converts would be then Entitu|led
to the publick Po&s;ts and Tru&s;ts in the Government, and be all
Low Church Men or Whigs, as ye call them, for &s;uch they would
certainly be: What would then become of your High Church?
They might in time come to open the Door farther, Vote down
your Liturgy, Epi&s;copacy, and what not; and &s;o the Church's
Danger would encrea&s;e from the Conver&s;ion of the Party: There|fore
in their Sen&s;es, the High-Church-Men cannot wi&s;h to let
them into the Church, and &s;o all this fine and mo&s;t &s;pecious
Scheme of Charity and Agreement, appears a meer Sham; what
the Church in general has given no Commi&s;&s;ion to offer, and
what the Party in particular cannot de&s;ire, without wi&s;hing their
own Extirpation and effectual Ruin as a Party.</P>
<P>Thus a &s;candalous Refuge of Lies runs thro' the whole Book:
The De&s;ign of which is plain,</P>
<P>To fill the Nation with ill Sugge&s;tions of the Queen, the Mi|ni&s;try,
the Bi&s;hops and the Hou&s;e of Lords, as Per&s;ons e&s;trang'd
from the true Intere&s;t of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> abetting Whigs
and Di&s;&s;enters, and invading the Privileges of the Commons.</P>
<P>How ab&s;urd the Imagination is, how managed with Gall and
Bitterne&s;s, little Argument and no Manners; I Appeal to the
Book for.</P>
<P>But le&s;t it &s;hould not prevail with all Parties, and that every
Sort may be dealt with by Arguments mo&s;t &s;uitable to their own
Con&s;titution, there are Wheedlers for the Fooli&s;h, &s;uch as the&mdash;&s;ham
Offer of Church Moderation hinted before: Then there are
Frights for the Timerous, &s;uch as Threatnings of the Church's
Re&s;entment, and that in Terms &s;o In&s;olent, that in Obedience to
<HI>Sachevrel</HI>'s Commands, the Bloody-Flag is hung out, even again&s;t

<P>If this be not Rebellion, I would be glad to &s;ee it Explain'd.

Church of <HI>England,</HI> will di&s;po&s;e Men to bear a great deal, but
he is a mad Man that tries how much. For when Men are ve|ry
much provoked, Nature is apt to Rebel again&s;t Principle.
Nor is it to be expected that they &s;hould long bear to be thus
u&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>From thus going on to Threaten the whole Nation with
taking Arms, they in particular Bully my Lord Trea&s;urer thus</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="23">
The Trea&s;urer is Wi&s;e, let him therefore look to that, and ma|turely
Weigh who is to be provoked at this Time.</P>
<P>Of all the Pamphlets that were ever Publi&s;h'd in <HI>England</HI> &s;ince
the Re&s;toration, none ever &s;poke &s;uch plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as this, I
think it needs no Comment; 'tis a plain Declaration of the depo|&s;ed
Mini&s;try, for they are in every Paragraph mentioned as the
Per&s;ons for whom the Party are Aggriev'd.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 25. They are Enumerated, the D. of <HI>B&mdash;ham,</HI> E. of
<HI>No&mdash;ham, Ro&mdash;r, Jer&mdash;y, Winch&mdash;&s;ea,</HI> Sir <HI>Ed. Se&mdash;r,</HI>
L. <HI>Gran&mdash;l, Gl&mdash;rd, Go&mdash;r,</HI> E. of <HI>Dy&s;ert,</HI> Sir <HI>G.&mdash;Ro&mdash;k.</HI>
The&s;e, &s;ays the Memorial, turn'd out <HI>without the
lea&s;t Pretence or Colour of Offence.</HI> Page 26. <HI>Was any Thing ob|jected
to them that might de&s;erve to be Puni&s;hed with the Lo&s;s of their
Places?</HI></P>
<P>Here's Obedience! The Queen mu&s;t be Ask't what Her Ma|je&s;ty's
Rea&s;ons are for Di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Her Officers.</P>
<P>In the next Paragraph the Bi&s;hops are Cry'd down, and we
are told, <HI>Lawn-Sleeves are no Tokens of True Church-Men:</HI> But a
few they tell us are left, and to the&s;e an Humble Petition is made,
That <HI>the Lower-Clergy, who want only to be Headed and Counte|nanc'd,
may be Encourag'd to Exert them&s;elves in Defence of the
Church.&mdash;And to &s;hew their re&s;pective Congregations the Evil
of that Po&s;ition, that there ought to be no Di&s;tinction among Pro|re&s;tants.</HI></P>
<P>And now Gentlemen, do You ask Rea&s;ons why the Queen
and the wi&s;er Men of the Nation <HI>left your Mea&s;ures?</HI> Do You
ask for what Rea&s;on the&s;e Men were turn'd out of Office?
For what Rea&s;on your <HI>own Bi&s;hops,</HI> and the be&s;t of your Clergy
abandon'd You?</P>
<P>The&s;e very Things were the Rea&s;ons, becau&s;e they &s;aw You
abandon all manner of <HI>Temper,</HI> they &s;aw You bent at <HI>Embroiling
the Nation,</HI> Trampling on your Brethren, Per&s;ecuting <HI>Con&s;ci|ence,</HI>
and Widening <HI>Breaches;</HI> they &s;aw You all Sworn Enemies
to Peace, and that You had doom'd all your Chri&s;tian Brethren
to the Devil <HI>the Shorte&s;t Way;</HI> they &s;aw You Mad with Fury,
and Drunk with Rage, and by no Mea&s;ures to be ruled or
guided.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="24">
Thus You turn'd out your Selves; You drove every Man of
Moderate Principles from You; You made all your Friends a|fraid
of you; and to allow &s;ome People to &s;ee as well as your
Selves, the Queen di&s;mi&s;s'd You, that You might not by your
precipitant Conduct overthrow the Church You pretended to
&s;ecure. Her Maje&s;ty &s;ent your <HI>Bu&mdash;hams, Nott&mdash;hams,
G&mdash;vills</HI> and <HI>Dy&mdash;ts,</HI> your <HI>Sey&mdash;rs</HI> and <HI>R&mdash;ks</HI> home,
that they might retire into the Country, <HI>Shave their Heads,</HI>
Air their Under&s;tandings, and coming up again like <HI>Nebuchadnez|zar,
when he came Home from Gra&s;s,</HI> new Men, recover'd and
found, they might be better qualify'd to guide the State, and be
capable of finding out &s;ome other Ways to &s;ecure the Church,
than by flying in the Face of Law, Liberty and Con&s;ci|ence,
to the Reporoach of Religion, and Scandal of the Go|vernment.</P>
<P>Of all Men in the Nation, I think the&s;e have the lea&s;t
Rea&s;on to complain of Her Maje&s;ty's di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them in time,
who, had they been &s;uffer'd to go on, mu&s;t have been di&s;|plac'd
by the Axe or the Halter, for involving their So|vereign
in the Oppre&s;&s;ions, Breaches and Tyranny of their
Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The Queen, who is far from being that <HI>Tool of Her Mini&s;try,</HI>
which they &s;uppos'd Her, and which their own Experience
might tell them <HI>She was not.</HI> Tho' Her Maje&s;ty's Zeal for
the Church is beyond the Reach of their Slander, yet having
never de&s;ign'd to E&s;tabli&s;h it on Blood and Perfecution, &s;oon
found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>Check this Torrent.</HI> Her Ma|je&s;ty
on all Occa&s;ions declar'd Her Love of Peace and earne&s;t
De&s;ire of the Union of Her People, and pro&s;e&s;s't Her Re&s;olu|tion
to promote it. But when Her Maje&s;ty's Mea&s;ures came
to be laid before the&s;e Gentlemen, they all <HI>flew in the Face of
their Sovereign.</HI> Thus they turn'd them&s;elves out of Place $
And do they now ask the Queen a Rea&s;on, why they are di&s;|mi&s;s'd?
<HI>Why really Gentlemen,</HI> becau&s;e the Queen wanted no
<HI>Jehu's,</HI> no <HI>Boutefeus,</HI> no <HI>Firebrands</HI> to root out and de&s;troy the
Church. But her Maje&s;ty and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> taught
by better Ma&s;ters, and built on better Principles, &s;uitable to
the Gentle, Meek and <HI>ea&s;y to be entreated Rules</HI> of the Chri&s;ti|an
<PB N="20" REF="25">
Religion, were not to be hook'd into the&s;e <HI>bloody Mea&s;ures,</HI>
but broke the <HI>Projected Ruin of Her People,</HI> heal'd the early
Wound, quench'd the Fire in its fir&s;t kindling, and the Men
dropt of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And it is to be remark'd with what Regret Her Maje&s;ty &s;aw
the Nece&s;&s;ity of parcing the&s;e ra&s;h People, and yet what ill
U&s;e they make of Her Royal Forbearance, how long She try'd
them, with what Patience Her Maje&s;ty has born their In&s;ults,
how long before they were turn'd out, how often &s;ollicited to
change their Mea&s;ures and to joyn in the general Good, how
many of them Her Maje&s;ty has left in their Places to this
Hour, &s;triving to Convince and Reclaim 'em, and hoping for
their Amendments, and not one Man put out, that could be
prevail'd with to fall in with the Intere&s;t of his Country, and
of the Church.</P>
<P>And as the&s;e are the Mea&s;ures the Queen has us'd, 'tis
plain, You have turn'd cut your Selves, and You will go
on to ruin your Selves to the la&s;t Ga&s;p; your Inveterate
Speeches, your Malignant Spirits, your <HI>Tacking,</HI> your <HI>Co|ventry
Elections,</HI> your Bullying the Government, what do
they all tend to, but your own Ruin? And if God and
the Queen had no more Mercy for, and in regard to, the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> than the&s;e Men, they would make Her
fir&s;t a Prey to any Enemy that &s;hould next Invade Her, by
ruining that Union and Peace, which alone, <HI>Miracles excepted,</HI>
can uphold Her.</P>
<P>And as every Step this Party has larely taken, has been a
Step backward as to their own Intere&s;t, &s;o let us examine
a little the general Scheme of this Book.&mdash;One would think
it was writ by &s;ome Body that was in a Plot again&s;t the High-Church,
that it was <HI>an Irony,</HI> to Expo&s;e 'em, like <HI>Defoe's Short|e&s;t
Way with the Di&s;&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P>To have the Pa&s;&s;ive Church of <HI>England</HI> threaten to &s;ecure
them&s;elves at the Peril of the Queen's Mini&s;ters, to have them
tell Her Maje&s;ty, <HI>for telling the Mini&s;try &s;o, is the &s;ame thing,</HI> She
had be&s;t not to provoke 'em too much.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>What can be the &V;&s;e of this?</HI> Really Gentlemen, not at all to
Awe, Affright, or Terrify the Minitry, who&s;e Protection is
<PB N="21" REF="26">
in the Laws, and the Laws in the whole People of <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
but 'tis hanging out a Lanthon in a dark Way, to
tell the Queen and Her Mini&s;try, if they meet with any
Ob&s;truction, or any Interruption in their Government, <HI>who to
lay their Hands on fir&s;t.</HI> And I mu&s;t recommend it to the D. of
<HI>B.</HI> my Ld. <HI>N. R.&mdash;I&mdash;y, W&mdash;&s;ea, D&mdash;t, Gr&mdash;vill,
G&mdash;er,</HI> Sir <HI>E. Seymr.</HI> Sir <HI>G. R.</HI> and the outed Gentlemen
to con&s;ider, whether in &s;ome Countrys and Governments
&s;uch an Impudent Sugge&s;tion would not have caus'd them
all to have been taken up, and at lea&s;t to have given Cauti|on
and very good Ho&s;tages for their Behaviour and Forth-Coming.</P>
<P>And therefore it &s;eems well worth heir Con&s;ideration,
whether it does not behove them to Teftifie their Abhorrence
of a Pamphlet, which in&s;ults their Sovereign in their Names,
and to prote&s;t openly again&s;t the Seditious Principles, &s;ugge&s;ted
by a Party who pretend to Expo&s;e their Intere&s;t?</P>
<P>Nor is this needful for them, in re&s;pect to Duty and their
Obligation to the Queen only: But if this exa&s;perated Spirit of
a High-Party &s;hould, <HI>as God only knows where it will end,</HI> reach
to offer any In&s;olence to the Queen's Per&s;on, what could the&s;e
Gentlemen, <HI>&s;ingled and mark'd out as the Per&s;ons in who&s;e Behalf
this is done,</HI> expect from the People? For my part, I do not
think any Body can an&s;wer for the Rage of a provok'd Nation,
if A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, as it has once been entred into by this very
Party, &s;hould come a &s;econd time into their De&s;ign, and God
for our Sins &s;hould &s;uffer any Fatal Effect of it to be brought
to pa&s;s, who &s;hall an&s;wer for it? That the enrag'd People would
not make an immediate Sacrifice of tho&s;e Men in the fir&s;t Heat,
as the very Per&s;ons pointed out in this Book, for who&s;e &s;akes
the&s;e Things were openly threatned.</P>
