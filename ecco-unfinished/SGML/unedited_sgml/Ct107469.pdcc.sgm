<HEAD>DEDICATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My Honoured Patrons,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BE you many in Number, or &s;ew, in high Condition, or low; to you only do I dedi|cate the following Performance, different from the Poets View, who addre&s;&s;es &s;ome particular Per&s;onage, is my De&s;ign of acco&s;ting you; he, by &s;oothing his Vanity hopes to draw from him &s;ome pecuniary Reward: I, by dedicating to you, have nothing more in Pro&s;pect than the Plea&s;ure 0218 0 of your mere Approbation, which has ever been e&s;teemed by me as your be&s;t Reward, not that I think this Trifle &s;hou'd &s;tand in Competition with tho&s;e more &s;erious Works, which, however, mean in them&s;elves, had &s;till this Merit to recommend them, that they labour'd the Advancement of your general Intere&s;t, but as coming from the &s;ame Hand, its Imperfections may hope for the greater Indulgence: 'Twas wrote to avoid &s;evere Reflec|tion ari&s;ing from melancholy Circum&s;tances, and with all that Indifferency of Mind, with Re&s;pect to Per&s;ons, as if I had only been an idle Spec|tator of tho&s;e Enormities I formerly endeavoured to correct. None then can complain they are par|ticularly la&s;hed at, for if the Vice &s;o incru&s;t the Man, that there is no dividing them, the Work of Virtue mu&s;t not be left undone, becau&s;e &s;ome few ba&s;e Particulars may &s;uffer by the Application.</P>
<P>Had the Spirit of the Times been &s;uited to Entertainments of a moral and in&s;tructive Na|ture, I might have hoped to have drawn &s;ome Emolument from their Pieces being acted; but alas! the Tyranny and Corruption &s;o much com|plained of in higher States, has crep't even into our Plea&s;ures. The Stage that u&s;ed to be the in|genious Man's la&s;t Re&s;ource and only Refuge from the Neglect of an ignorant and debas'd Nobiliy,
<PB N="ii" REF="3">is now become the Property of a Banditti of vile Players, Men who are not more corrupt in their Morals, than vitiated and &s;unk in their Ta&s;tes and Under&s;tandings; who try every Thing by the Te&s;t of their own Ignorance, and conclude no|thing good that is not full as bad as them&s;elves cou'd have made it, yet the&s;e mu&s;t the Ingenious apply to, and after a painful and heavy Atten|dance of many Sea&s;ons, where more Compliment is met with than Probity, more hearty Profe&s;&s;ions than well-meaning, be content with a civil Di&s;|mi&s;s of all their Hopes, and think them, even then, not their wor&s;t Patrons</P>
<P>The&s;e my Friends, you will &s;ay, are the con|&s;equential Ills of a Decline of Liberty; but as in a Storm no Man lets go his Hold, while the lea&s;t Hopes remains of weathering out the Tempe&s;t; &s;o I, who&s;e Voice you have &s;o often heard encou|raging you in the Mid&s;t of your mo&s;t imminent Dangers, will not be the fir&s;t to &s;ing the Dirge of De&s;pair, as the vulgar Saying has it, <HI>While there's Life there's Hopes,</HI> 'tis but thinking piou&s;ly of Providence, to &s;ay &s;he creates the&s;e Evils for the brave to grapple with. Let no ill Succe&s;s then hitherto, deter you from the Pur&s;uit of generous Views, nor think Virtue the le&s;s amiable for being unfortunate. 'Tis the Tax of brave Minds to be obnoxious to the Ba&s;e and Vulgar. Much Worth|le&s;&s;ne&s;s was never much per&s;ecuted, and to de|&s;erve well of one's Country, is the only Way to offend the Enemies of it; may &s;uch Offence never be wanting till you attain the End you wi&s;h for, and every Supporter of &s;o brave a Cau&s;e &s;hare in the Honour due to the di&s;intere&s;ted Endeavours,</P>
