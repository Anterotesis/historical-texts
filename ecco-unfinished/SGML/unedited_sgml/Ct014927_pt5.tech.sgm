<P>VERSE 12. <HI>With wanton glee, the pro&s;tituted fair.</HI>]</P>
<P><HI>_EUSTATHIUS</HI> expatiates upon the conduct of
the&s;e female &s;ervants of <HI>Penelope.</HI> Silence and a
decent re&s;erve (remarks that Author) is the
ornament of the fair &s;ex; levity and laugh|ter
betray them into an unguarded beha|viour,
and make them &s;u&s;ceptible of wan|ton
impre&s;&s;ions. The <HI>Athenians,</HI> as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI>
informs us, had a Temple &s;acred to Love and
<HI>Venus</HI> the Whi&s;perer. <HI>Venus</HI> was called the Whi&s;perer (<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">)
becau&s;e they who there offer'd up their prayers apply'd their
mouths to the ear of the &s;tatue of that Godde&s;s, and whi&s;per'd
their petitions; an Intimation, that Women ought to govern
their tongue, and not let it tran&s;gre&s;s either by loudne&s;s or loqua|city.
But this no way affects the Ladies of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> they
&s;peak &s;o well, they &s;hould never be &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="31">
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es, Homer</HI> tells us, is almo&s;t provok'd to kill the&s;e females
with his own hands: This has been imagin'd a thought unwor|thy
an Heroe. The like objection has been made again&s;t <HI>Aentas</HI>
in <HI>Virgil</HI> (<HI>Aeneid,</HI> lib. 2. ver. 567.)
<Q><L><HI>Thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The gracele&s;s</HI> Helen <HI>in the porch I &s;py'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of</HI> Ve&s;ta'<HI>s temple: there &s;he lurk'd alone,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Muffled &s;he &s;ate, and what &s;he could, unknown;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Trembling with rage, the &s;trumpet I regard,</HI></L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd to give her guilt the due reward.</L></Q>
This whole pa&s;&s;age is &s;aid to have been expung'd from <HI>Virgil</HI> by
<HI>Tucca</HI> and <HI>Varius;</HI> for as <HI>Virgil</HI> there expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q><L>'Tis true a &s;oldier can &s;mall honour gain,</L>
<L>And boa&s;t no conque&s;t from a woman &s;lain, <HI>Dryden.</HI></L></Q>
But the Objection is probably made with too great &s;everity, both
again&s;t <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil:</HI> It is no di&s;grace to the be&s;t or bra|ve&s;t
man, to be &s;ubject to &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions as betray him into no
unworthy actions: A Heroe is not &s;uppos'd to be in&s;en&s;ible;
he di&s;tingui&s;hes him&s;elf as &s;uch, if he re&s;trains them within the
bounds of rea&s;on. Both <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> are fir'd with a ju&s;t
indignation, and this is agreeable to human nature; but both of
them proceed to no outragious action, and this &s;hews that their
pa&s;&s;ions are govern'd by &s;uperior rea&s;on. However this re&s;ent|ment
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is le&s;s liable to objection than that of <HI>Aeneas:
Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;ubdues his indignation by the reflection of his own
rea&s;on; but <HI>Virgil</HI> introduces a Machine to compo&s;e the &s;pirit
of <HI>Aeneas:</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;all &s;hining heav'nly bright,</L>
<L>My mother &s;tood reveal'd before my &s;ight,</L>
<L>She held my hand, the de&s;tin'd blow to break, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<PB N="31" REF="32">
It may be further added that the ca&s;e is very different between
<HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> The per&s;ons whom <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> intends to puni&s;h
are his &s;ubjects and &s;ervants, and &s;uch a puni&s;hment would be no
more than an act of ju&s;tice, as he is their Ma&s;ter and King; and
we find in the &s;equel of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> that he actually inflicts it.
It &s;hould therefore be thought an in&s;tance of <HI>Homer</HI>'s judgment,
in painting the di&s;orders of the&s;e &s;ervants in &s;uch &s;trong colours,
that we may acknowledge the ju&s;tice, when he afterwards brings
them to puni&s;hment.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 20. <HI>As o'er her young the mother-ma&s;tiff growls,</HI> &amp;c.]
This in the original is a very bold expre&s;&s;ion, but <HI>Homer</HI> to
&s;often it, in&s;tances a compari&s;on which reconciles us to it. <HI>Ennius</HI>
has litterally tran&s;lated it, as <HI>Spondanus</HI> ob&s;erves:
<Q>&mdash;animu&s;que in pectore <HI>latrat.</HI></Q>
That is word for word,
<Q>&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
The &s;imilitude it&s;elf is very expre&s;&s;ive; as the ma&s;tiff barks to
guard her young, &s;o labours the &s;oul of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in defence of his
Son and Wife, <HI>Penelope</HI> and <HI>Telemachus. Dacier</HI> was afraid that
the compari&s;on could not be render'd with any beauty in the
<HI>French</HI> tongue, and therefore has &s;ub&s;tituted another in the room
of it, <HI>Son coeur rugi&s;&s;oit au dedans de luy, comme un Lion rugit au|tour
d'une bergerie, o&ugrave; il ne &s;&ccedil;auroit entrer.</HI> But however more
noble the Lion may be than the Ma&s;tiff, it is evident that &s;he
utterly deviates from the allu&s;ion: The Ma&s;tiff rages in defence
of her young, <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> of his Son <HI>Telemachus;</HI> but how is this
repre&s;ented by a Lion roaring round a fold, which he is not to
defend, but de&s;troy? We have therefore cho&s;en to follow <HI>Homer</HI>
in the more humble but more expre&s;&s;ive &s;imilitude; and what
<PB N="32" REF="33">
will entirely reconcile us to it, is the great honour which was
paid to Dogs by the Ancients: they were kept as a piece of
&s;tate by Princes and Heroes, and therefore a compari&s;on drawn
from them was held to be as noble as if it had been drawn
from a Lion.</P>

Mon&s;ieur <HI>Perault</HI> is particularly &s;evere upon it: <HI>Homer</HI> (&s;ays

broiling on a gridiron; whereas the truth is, he compares
that Hero turning and to&s;&s;ing in his bed, burning with impa|tience
to &s;atisfy him&s;elf with the blood of the Suitors, to a
man in &s;harp hunger preparing the entrails of a victim over a
great fire; and the agitation repre&s;ents the agitation of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.
Homer</HI> compares not the thing, but the per&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Boileau,</HI> in his notes upon <HI>Longinus,</HI> an&s;wers this objection.
It is notorious that the belly of &s;ome animals was one of
the mo&s;t delicious di&s;hes among&s;t the ancients: that the
<HI>&s;umex</HI> or &s;ow's belly was boa&s;ted of for its excellence by
the <HI>Romans,</HI> and forbidden by a &s;umptuary law as too volup|tuous.
Be&s;ides, the <HI>Greek</HI> word u&s;ed to expre&s;s a black-pudding
was not invented in the days of <HI>Homer. Ogylby</HI> indeed thus
renders it:
<Q>As one a pudding broiling on the coals.</Q>
But you will ask, Is not the allu&s;ion mean at be&s;t, and does
it not convey a low image? Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier</HI> an&s;wers in the
negative, in his notes upon <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Poetics. The compari&s;on
is borrow'd from &s;acrifices which yielded blood and fat, and
was therefore &s;o far from being de&s;picable, that it was look'd
upon with veneration by antiquity. <HI>Lib.</HI> 1. of the <HI>Iliad:</HI>
<Q><L>On the&s;e, in double cawls involv'd with art,</L>
<L>The choice&s;t mor&s;els lay from every part.</L></Q>
The <HI>Cawls</HI> and the <HI>choice&s;t mor&s;els</HI> were the fat of the Victim,
&s;elected as the be&s;t part of it, to be offer'd to the Gods. We
may find that the thought was noble in the oriental language,
for the Author of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;t.</HI> makes u&s;e of it, 47. 2. <HI>As is the
fat taken from the peace-offering, &s;o was</HI> David <HI>cho&s;en out of the

the worth and excellence of <HI>David,</HI> could be no degadation to
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>But what is under&s;tood by the <HI>belly of the bea&s;t, full of fat
and blood? Boileau</HI> is of opinion that tho&s;e words denote the fat

a real and unfeign'd laughter. But how will the words be
brought to bear this con&s;truction? Very naturally: They laugh'd
as if they had borrow'd their cheeks, as if their cheeks were not
their own, and con&s;equently they were not afraid to u&s;e them
with licence and exce&s;s; (&s;uch per&s;ons as the Suitors having no re|gard

<P>THIS book is entitled <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or the
<HI>propo&s;ition of the Bow:</HI> This action of <HI>Pene|lope</HI>
has given occa&s;ion of raillery both to
modern and ancient Critics; they in&s;inuate
that &s;he propos'd this exerci&s;e of the bow to
try the &s;trength of her gallants, determining
to have regard to that &s;ingle qualification in
the choice of her husband.
<Q><L>Penelope vires juvenum tentabat in arcu,</L>
<L>Qui latus argueret, corneus arcus erat.</L></Q>
They interpret <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> into a &s;en&s;e very contrary to the
character of <HI>Penelope.</HI> 'Tis true, other Authors have directly
charg'd her with Incha&s;tity, and affirm that &s;he had a &s;on na|med
<HI>Pan,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>all</HI> the Suitors had a &s;hare in him. <HI>Lycophron</HI>
calls her
<Q><PB N="84" REF="83">
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q></P>
<P>It is the exerci&s;e of the Bow that has occa&s;ion'd the&s;e impu|tations;
for none of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Commentators have given the rea|&s;on
why &s;he propo&s;es that exerci&s;e in particular; and therefore &s;ee|ing
no rea&s;on for it, they have invented a fal&s;e one, and give the
&s;tory a ridiculous air: I flatter my &s;elf that a better &s;olution
may be found out, and a rea&s;on given why <HI>Penelope</HI> propo&s;es this
exerci&s;e in particular, and preferably to any other.</P>
<P>We are to remember that this day was &s;acred to <HI>Apollo;</HI> this
is evident from the preceding book, where the <HI>Ithacans</HI> offer an
Hecatomb in a grove con&s;ecrated to that Deity: The diver&s;ion
&s;uits the day, the exerci&s;e of the bow being proper to be
practi&s;ed on the fe&s;tival of that Deity, who is the patron of it.
Several of the titles of <HI>Apollo</HI> are derived from it; <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
It is &s;trange that this nece&s;&s;ary ob|&s;ervation
&s;hould e&s;cape the notice of all Commentators.</P>
<P>If any thing further were wanting to reconcile us to the con|duct
of <HI>Penelope</HI> in propo&s;ing the Bow, an in&s;tance almo&s;t paral|lel
to it might be produced from Hi&s;tory. When <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> was
preparing to make war again&s;t <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> the King of that coun|try
bent his great bow with two fingers in the pre&s;ence of the
<HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors, and unbending it again, deliver'd it to them
with the&s;e words: That when the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> could do the like, they
might hope to conquer the <HI>Aethiopians.</HI> There is nothing more
ab&s;urd in the delivery of the bow to the Suitors by <HI>Penelope,</HI> than
in the &s;ame act of the <HI>Aethiopian</HI> King to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Amba&s;|&s;adors.</P>

<P>VERSE 9. <HI>A brazen key &s;he held,</HI> &amp;c.] The numerous par|ticularities
and digre&s;&s;ive Hi&s;tories crowded together in the be|ginning
of this book have not e&s;cap'd cen&s;ure. The Poet very
circum&s;tantially de&s;cribes the key, and the make of it, as like|wi&s;e
<PB N="85" REF="84">
the bow and quiver, then tells us who gave it to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI>
at the mention of the donor's name he &s;tarts into a little Hi&s;tory
of him, and returns not in many lines to his &s;ubject; he then
no le&s;s circum&s;tantially de&s;cribes the chamber, and the frame of
the door, he de&s;cends to every particular of <HI>Penelope</HI>'s opening it,
and every &s;tep and motion &s;he takes till &s;he produces the bow be|fore
the Suitors. This conduct has been liable to objection, as
made up of particulars of &s;mall importance, to no propos'd end.
But notwith&s;tanding, every circum&s;tance is not without its effect
and beauty, and nothing better &s;hows the power of the Poet's
diction. So great a Critic as <HI>Vida</HI> admir'd this very pa&s;&s;age.

<L>Su&s;pen&s;as trahit, ante viri quam proferet arcum?</L></Q>
The Poet adapts his ver&s;e to the nature of his &s;ubject;
the de&s;cription loiters, to expre&s;s the &s;tudied delay of <HI>Pe|nelope,</HI>
and her unwillingne&s;s to bring affairs to a deci&s;ion. How|ever
I will not promi&s;e that the&s;e digre&s;&s;ions and ancient hi|&s;tories
will plea&s;e every Reader; the pa&s;&s;age is &s;o far from being
faulty, that it is really an in&s;tance of <HI>Homer</HI>'s judgment; yet
every thing that is not a fault, is not a beauty. The ca&s;e is,
<HI>Penelope</HI> propo&s;es the tryal of the bow, merely to protract time
from the nuptials; &s;he is &s;low in producing it for the &s;ame rea|&s;on;
and <HI>Homer,</HI> to paint this &s;lowne&s;s in a lively manner, lets the
&s;ubject of the Poem &s;tand &s;till, and wanders out of the way,
that he may not come too &s;oon to the end of his journey.</P>

So that even this digre&s;&s;ion is not foreign to the purpo&s;e: The
Poet largely de&s;cribes the bow, being to make great u&s;e of it in the
&s;equel of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI> he &s;hews it was originally in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Eurytus,</HI> the mo&s;t famous archer in the world: Nay, this very di|gre&s;&s;ion
may appear to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; it being requi&s;ite
to de&s;cribe that bow, as of no common excellence and &s;trength,
which was not to be drawn by any of the Suitors; and at the
&s;ame time it &s;ets off the &s;trength of the Heroe of the Poem, who

It is wonderful how exactly the Poet ob&s;erves the di&s;tribution
of time; he di&s;tinctly marks the action of every day, and
allots a proper &s;pace to every action. In this place the Poem
goes forward while <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> withdraws to engage the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of <HI>Philaetius</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus.</HI> The Suitors are amus'd and em|ploy'd
about the Bow, while <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;teals away from their
ob&s;ervation, and returns without rai&s;ing their jealou&s;y. The
Poet likewi&s;e manages the time of the di&s;covery of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
very judiciou&s;ly; tho' he knew the fidelity of <HI>Eumaeus</HI> and <HI>Phi|laetius,</HI>
yet he tru&s;ts them not with the knowledge of his Per|&s;on,
till the very hour of execution; agreable to the general cha|racter
of his cautious nature and profound &s;ecrecy. But then is
not this an imputation to <HI>Penelope,</HI> that he &s;hould chu&s;e to di&s;co|ver
him&s;elf to the&s;e two per&s;ons, rather than to his Queen? The
an&s;wer is, There was a nece&s;&s;ity for his di&s;covery to the former,
but none to the latter; he wants their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the future en|gagement,
and makes good u&s;e of it; whereas a di&s;covery made
to the Queen could have been of no advantage, and might po&s;&s;ibly
have prov'd detrimental; be&s;ides, this is a &s;ea&s;on that requires
expedition; and we find <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> complies with it, and is very
conci&s;e in the di&s;covery and interview with <HI>Philaetius</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus.</HI>

it is an adventitious remembrance, and the&s;e remembrances
(continues <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>) may be us'd with more or le&s;s art: Thus in
the ca&s;e of this wound of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> it is us'd by <HI>Homer</HI> in a diffe|rent
way: <HI>Euryclea,</HI> Lib. 19. de&s;cribes it accidentally; <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> here
&s;hews it to <HI>Eumaeus</HI> and <HI>Philaetius</HI> voluntarily; and it is certain
that all tho&s;e marks which a Poet de&s;ignedly and deliberately u&s;es
to e&s;tabli&s;h any verity, have le&s;s ingenuity than tho&s;e which pro|duce
their effects unde&s;ignedly and ca&s;ually, and con&s;equently the

to have recour&s;e to &s;uch marks, when we have an intention to
make the di&s;covery: it cau&s;es no &s;urprize nor variety, neither
is it produc'd by any art or invention: On the contrary, the
other in the nineteenth book ari&s;es from the &s;ubject, and not
from the fancy of the Poet only. But, &s;ays <HI>Dacier,</HI> when <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI>
affirms that this pre&s;ent remembrance wants ingenuity, we
are not yet to imagine that he condemns it; for it is a remem|brance
made by nece&s;&s;ity. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> has not opportunity to wait till
the di&s;covery is made accidentally, as in the nineteenth Book; he

I will only further ob&s;erve the judgment of <HI>Homer</HI>
in making this di&s;covery with the utmo&s;t brevity, concluding it
in the compa&s;s of two ver&s;es: he had before enlarg'd upon the

is, becau&s;e he fears his inability to draw it: The feign'd rea&s;on
is a pretended piety paid to the day: it was a day to be ob|&s;erv'd
religiou&s;ly, and he in&s;inuates that all &s;ports upon it are a
prophanation of it; and con&s;equently, <HI>Apollo</HI> being provok'd,
di&s;ables them from drawing the Bow, of which he is the patron.
This is the rea&s;on why he propo&s;es to offer a libation, to attone
for the abu&s;e of the day by their diver&s;ions. But perhaps the
rea&s;on why <HI>Antinous</HI> defers the exerci&s;e of the Bow to the follow|ing
day, is not becau&s;e he thought it unlawful to proceed in it
on the fe&s;tival of <HI>Apollo;</HI> for why &s;hould an exerci&s;e which was
in&s;tituted in honour of that Deity, be thought a prophanation
of the day? I &s;hould therefore rather conclude, that the impiety
intended by <HI>Antinous,</HI> was their omi&s;&s;ion in not offering a &s;acri|fice
to that God before they begun the tryal, that he might pro|&s;per
their endeavours: The conclu&s;ion of his &s;peech makes this
opinion probable: &startq;Let us now defer the experiment, and
offer &s;acrifice in the morning to <HI>Apollo,</HI> that he may give
us &s;ucce&s;s in drawing the Bow;&endq; which implies that they were
un&s;ucce&s;sful becau&s;e they had forgot to &s;acrifice. I will only add
that <HI>Antinous</HI> mentions a goat as an offering to <HI>Apollo;</HI> we have
before &s;een bulls, &s;heep and bullocks offer'd to that Deity; the
rea&s;on why a goat is a proper victim, I &s;uppo&s;e is becau&s;e he is a
rural God, and patron of &s;hepherds, and therefore all kinds of
bea&s;ts were offer'd to him promi&s;cuou&s;ly.</P>

dwelt in mount <HI>Pelion.</HI> This war between the <HI>Lapithites</HI> and the

The words in <HI>Homer</HI> are, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; which

them know that he will not give up the &s;way into their pow'r.
He tells <HI>Penelope</HI> that the Bow &s;hall be u&s;ed as he directs; this is
done to intimidate the Suitors, and prepare the way for the de|livery
of it to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> contrary to their injunctions to <HI>Eumaeus.</HI></P>

In that place <HI>Hector</HI> remembers that he is an husband, yet

from the duty of a &s;on, yet &s;peaks in the character and &s;tyle

<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> excellently enlarges upon the words of <HI>Telemachus:</HI>
There is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that <HI>Penelope</HI> &s;hould withdraw, that
&s;he might not be pre&s;ent at the &s;cene of blood and &s;laughter.
It is for the &s;ame rea&s;on that the Poet introduces <HI>Minerva</HI>

ignorant of the death of the Suitors: This is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary;

remark'd that machines are not always u&s;ed out of nece&s;&s;ity,
but frequently for ornament, to dignify the Poetry and create
&s;urpri&s;e by the appearance of a Deity. But here the Poet brings
down <HI>Minerva,</HI> to give credibility to the &s;tory; for tho' it be
true that nature is &s;ufficient to produce this effect, yet that it
&s;hould operate in the critical and exact moment, when the Poet
has occa&s;ion for it, is in &s;ome degree incredible: The Poet there|fore,
to reconcile the relation to probability, introduces a praeter-natural

TWENTY-SECOND BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_WE are now come to the great event or Ca|ta&s;trophe
of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> which is the De|&s;truction
of the Suitors. The manner by
which the Poet conducts it, has been prais'd
and cen&s;ur'd, by &s;ome as noble and heroic,
by others as romantic and incredible: It is
therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate <HI>Homer</HI>
in the chief action of the whole Poem, that
he may not be found culpable, in the place where he ought to
be the mo&s;t exact and draw his Heroe to the be&s;t advantage.
The Objection made again&s;t this deci&s;ive$action is, that the Poet
makes <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> perform impo&s;&s;ibilities; no one per&s;on, with &s;uch
&s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance, being able to de&s;troy above an hundred Enemies.
It is no an&s;wer to &s;ay that <HI>Pallas</HI> de&s;cends to aid <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> for it
has been already proved, that all incidents which require a divine
probability, &s;hould be &s;o di&s;engag'd from the action, that they
may be &s;ub&s;tracted from it without de&s;troying it; whereas this
action is e&s;&s;ential to it. No le&s;s a Critic than <HI>Longinus,</HI> Chap. 7.
<PB N="140" REF="139">
condemns <HI>Homer;</HI> for enumerating the faults of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> he
thus proceeds: &startq;To the&s;e may be added the ab&s;urdities he com|mits,
in the account of the de&s;truction of <HI>Penelope</HI>'s Suitors.&endq;
And <HI>Scaliger,</HI> Lib. 5. of his <HI>Poetics</HI> is of the &s;ame opinion:
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es interfecit arcu procos, inter quos &amp; ip&s;um tantillum e&s;&s;et in|tervalli:
Quare omnes &s;imul in eum impetum non fecerunt?</HI> The
&s;trength of this Objection lies in the omi&s;&s;ion of the Suitors in
not ru&s;hing at once upon <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in an united Body: Now this
was impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;tood upon the thre&s;hold in a narrow pa&s;s,
and by this advantage he was able to make it good again&s;t a
great inequality of numbers. It is not difficult to bring in&s;tances
of a like nature from undoubted hi&s;tory: <HI>Cocles</HI> alone defended
the bridge over the <HI>Tyber</HI> again&s;t the whole army of <HI>Por&s;ena,</HI> and
&s;tood unmoveable till the <HI>Romans</HI> broke it down behind him.
And <HI>Leonidas</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> General defended the Pa&s;s of <HI>Thermopylae</HI>
with a &s;mall number, again&s;t three millions of <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> led by
<HI>Xerxes;</HI> and if he had not been betray'd, he would have pro|bably
defeated his whole army. In both the&s;e in&s;tances there
was a greater inequality of numbers, than between <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and
the Suitors. The Reader will be reconcil'd to the probability of
the&s;e relations, if he con&s;iders that the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of war was
anciently decided by mere &s;trength of body: Fire-arms now &s;et
all men upon a nearer Level; but in the&s;e early ages, the &s;trong|e&s;t
per&s;on was the greate&s;t Heroe; a man of &s;uperior and un|common
&s;trength drove his enemies before him like an army of
boys, and with as much facility. From this ob&s;ervation it is evi|dent
that <HI>Homer</HI> &s;carce tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the bounds of hi&s;toric truth,
when he de&s;cribes <HI>Achilles</HI> cha&s;ing whole &s;quadrons of <HI>Trojans:</HI>
He wrote according to the manners of his times, and drew after
the life, tho' &s;ometimes he improv'd a feature to give grace to
the picture of his Heroe: Thus in the Scripture, from the mere
advantage of &s;trength, we &s;ee a &s;ingle <HI>Goliah</HI> defy the whole armies
of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rapin</HI> commends the conduct of <HI>Homer</HI> in bringing about the
de&s;truction of the Suitors. The unravelling the whole <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI>
(&s;ays that Author) by their Deaths, is very great, and very becom|ing
<PB N="141" REF="140">
an Heroe; that whole &s;tory is dre&s;s'd up in colours &s;o decent,
and at the &s;ame time &s;o noble, that antiquity can hardly match
any part of the narration; here <HI>Homer</HI> has di&s;play'd him&s;elf to
the be&s;t advantage. I wi&s;h <HI>Rapin</HI> had given his rea&s;ons, and
not run into a general commendation: But we &s;hall be &s;uf|ficiently
convinc'd of the judgment of <HI>Homer</HI> in de&s;cribing the
Suitors falling chiefly by <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> if we con&s;ider the nature of
Epic Poetry. The chief action is to be peform'd by the Heroe
of the Poem: thus <HI>Hector</HI> falls by <HI>Achilles, Turnus</HI> by <HI>Aeneas:</HI>
The death of the Suitors is the chief action of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> and
therefore it is nece&s;&s;arily to be executed by <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> for if any
other per&s;on had perform'd it, that per&s;on would have done an
action more noble than the Heroe of the Poem, and eclips'd his
glory. It is for the &s;ame rea&s;on that the Poet refu&s;es all ea&s;ie
methods to re-e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> he throws him into difficulties
which he is to &s;urmount by his own prowe&s;s and magnanimity.
<HI>Homer</HI> might ea&s;ily have rais'd an army, and plac'd <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> at the
head of it; but the more difficult way being mo&s;t conducive to
his honour, he rejects all ea&s;ie methods, &s;hews him &s;truggling
with infinite hazards, out of which he extricates him&s;elf per&s;o|nally
by his wi&s;dom and courage. By the&s;e means he com|pleats
the character of his Heroe, leaves a noble image of his
worth upon the minds of the Spectators, and makes him go
off the &s;tage with the utmo&s;t applau&s;e.</P>

that he is yet new to the horrors of war, and therefore wanting

From what has been ob&s;erv'd, it appears evidently that there

<HI>Melanthius</HI> conveys the arms to the Suitors by &s;ome other

<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of the apartments. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> properly denotes a rupture, and
here repre&s;ents the openings of the pa&s;&s;ages from room to room.
The Ancients thought this whole pa&s;&s;age &s;o ob&s;cure, that they
drew a plan of the&s;e inward pa&s;&s;ages of the palace, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI>
informs us; in this they figur'd the porch, the higher aperture,
the other &s;tair-ca&s;e, and the room where the arms were laid. But
<HI>Dacier</HI> &s;tarts another difficulty: If <HI>Melanthius</HI> could go up to the
room where the arms lay, why could he not go from thence into
the courts of the palace, and rai&s;e the city? The an&s;wer is, becau&s;e
the arms were plac'd in an inward apartment, and there was no
pa&s;&s;age from thence into the palace-yards. Her mi&s;take aro&s;e from
her opinion that there was an entry into the palace by the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,

the latter of the birds, their weakne&s;s and unavailing flight.
The Gadfly &s;hews the fury and clo&s;e pur&s;uit of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and his

well paints the Suitors flying in an herd, and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> wounding
them as they fly.</P>
<P>The latter &s;imile from the Hawks, affords &s;ome curio&s;ity in regard
to the antient manner of that &s;port. It is evident, &s;ays <HI>Dacier,</HI>
that this pa&s;&s;age is an in&s;tance, that flying of birds of prey, in the
nature of our hawking, was practis'd by the Ancients: The nets,
call'd by <HI>Homer</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, were fix'd in the plain ground; the
fowlers with their falcons took their &s;tation upon the adjoining
eminences; when the birds, driven from this ri&s;ing ground, flew
to the plain, they met with the nets, and endeavouring to e&s;cape
them, crowded into flocks; Then the Hawk or Vultur was
loos'd, and de&s;cending upon his prey, &s;lew them in multitudes;
for the birds were incapable of re&s;i&s;ting, and at the &s;ame time
were afraid of the nets, and therefore could not e&s;cape: This is
the rea&s;on why the fowlers are &s;aid to rejoice at the &s;port: A
plain indication, that the Poet intended to de&s;cribe the &s;portman's
flying his bird at the prey. That the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;ignifies <HI>Nets,</HI>
is evident from <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, that is, <HI>I
&s;wear by my nets: He&s;ychius</HI> is of the &s;ame opinion, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;ays
that Author, &s;ignifies the <HI>Clouds,</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Hunters
Nets. Eu&s;tathius</HI> directly affirms, that in his time this &s;port
was practis'd in many countries; and the place where the nets
were fixed was called <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. That Author con&s;trues the&s;e
words <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, as if <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> were to be under&s;tod, to
expre&s;s the ru&s;hing of the birds again&s;t the net; but there is no
occa&s;ion for this violence to the text, for by joining <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> with
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> the period will be plain, and &s;ignify, that thro' fear
of the net they fly with violence to avoid it. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier</HI>

<PB N="156" REF="155">

birds of prey, in conformity to this de&s;cription of <HI>Homer:</HI> This

The&s;e Altars were places of &s;anctuary, and by flying to them
the per&s;on was thought to be under the immediate protection of
the Deity, and therefore in &s;ome ca&s;es inviolable. The &s;ame
practice prevail'd among&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> for we find frequently in

hold on the horns of the Altar. This is the rea&s;on why <HI>Phe|mius</HI>
entertains an intention to fly to the Altar of <HI>Jupiter Hercaeus.
Plutarch</HI> in his treati&s;e upon Mu&s;ic, informs us, that <HI>Demodocus</HI>

he had of the great qualifications that were nece&s;&s;ary to form a
good Poet. He mu&s;t &s;ing of men and Gods; that is, be tho|roughly

he mu&s;t be a Genius; he mu&s;t have a natural ability, which is
indeed to be improv'd, but not capable of being learn'd, by &s;tudy:
He adds, that be&s;ides this felicity of nature, he mu&s;t have an
heavenly in&s;piration; this implies that he mu&s;t have a kind of
enthu&s;ia&s;m, an elevation of &s;oul which is not to be obtain'd by

A reverence is due to a good man, and con&s;equently it is a crime

It would in the&s;e ages, ob&s;erves <HI>Dacier,</HI> be thought barbarous in

Kings, commands his &s;on to kill them with the &s;word in his pre|&s;ence:
But, continues that author, I wi&s;h <HI>Homer</HI> had deviated
from this cu&s;tom, that he had given both <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Telemachus</HI>
&s;entiments of more humanity, and &s;par'd his Reader a de&s;cription
of &s;uch a terrible execution. I am not delighted with any thing
that has a tendency to Inhumanity more than that Lady; but it
may be an&s;wer'd, that <HI>Homer</HI> was obliged to write according to
the cu&s;tom of the age. <HI>Virgil</HI> has a&s;crib'd an act more cruel to

This act is to be a&s;crib'd to the manner of the age, and the cu|&s;toms

But here it may &s;eem e&s;&s;ential to the very nature of Epic Poetry to
relate this act of ju&s;tice: The moral of it is, to &s;ee the good re|warded

The&s;e criminals had been as guilty in their &s;everal capacities

ON THE
TWENTY-THIRD BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS book contains the Di&s;covery of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
to <HI>Penelope.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Rapin</HI> is very &s;evere
upon &s;ome parts of it; who&s;e objections I
&s;hall here recite.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to his Queen
was the mo&s;t favourable occa&s;ion imaginable
for the Poet to give us &s;ome of the nice&s;t
touches of his art; but as he has manag'd
it, it has nothing but faint and weak &s;urprizes, cold and lan|gui&s;hing
a&s;toni&s;hments, and very little of that delicacy and ex|qui&s;itene&s;s
which ought to expre&s;s a conjugal tenderne&s;s: He
leaves his wife too long in doubt and di&s;tru&s;t, and &s;he is too cau|tious
and circum&s;pect; the formalities &s;he ob&s;erves in being fully
a&s;&s;ur'd, and her care to act with &s;ecurity, are &s;et down in num|ber
and mea&s;ure, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould fall into any mi&s;take; and this
particularity makes the &s;tory dull, in a place that &s;o much requires
briskne&s;s and liveline&s;s. Ought not the &s;ecret in&s;tinct of her love
<PB N="194" REF="191">
to have in&s;pir'd her with other &s;entiments? and &s;hould not her
heart have told her, what her eyes could not? Love is penetra|ting,
and whi&s;pers more to us than the &s;en&s;es can convey; but
<HI>Homer</HI> under&s;tood not this Philo&s;ophy: <HI>Virgil,</HI> who makes <HI>Dido</HI>
fore&s;ee that <HI>Aeneas</HI> de&s;igns to leave her, would have made better
advantage of this favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of this objection con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the long in|credulity
of <HI>Penelope,</HI> and the &s;lowne&s;s &s;he u&s;es to make an un|deniable
di&s;covery: This <HI>Rapin</HI> judges to be contrary to the pa&s;&s;ion
of love, and con&s;equently that the Poet writes unnaturally.</P>
<P>There is &s;omewhat of the <HI>Frenchman</HI> in this Critici&s;m: <HI>Homer</HI>
in his opinion wants vivacity; and if <HI>Rapin</HI> had been to have
drawn <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> we had &s;een him all tran&s;port and ec&s;ta&s;y. But
where there is mo&s;t fancy, there is often the lea&s;t judgment.
<HI>Penelope</HI> thought <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to be dead; he had been ab&s;ent twenty
years; and thro' ab&s;ence and his pre&s;ent di&s;gui&s;e, he was another
per&s;on from that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> whom &s;he knew, when he &s;ail'd to <HI>Troy;</HI>
&s;o that he was become an ab&s;olute &s;tranger. From this ob&s;erva|tion
we may appeal to the Reader's judgment, if <HI>Penelope,</HI> with|out
full conviction, ought to be per&s;uaded that this per&s;on was
the real <HI>Uly&s;&s;es?</HI> And how could &s;he be convinc'd, but by asking
many que&s;tions, and de&s;cending to particularities, which mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion delay in the di&s;covery? If indeed <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and
<HI>Penelope</HI> had met after a &s;horter ab&s;ence, when one view would
have a&s;&s;ured her that he was her real husband, then too much

'Till this moment the di&s;covery was not evidently made, and her
pa&s;&s;ion would have been un&s;ea&s;onable; but this is no &s;ooner done,
but &s;he falls into an agony of affection. If &s;he had here ap|pear'd
cool and indifferent, there had been weight in <HI>Rapin</HI>'s ob|jections.
Be&s;ides, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> informs us, that there was a Play,
call'd <HI>the Fal&s;e</HI> Uly&s;&s;es: It was form'd upon a &s;tory of a per&s;on
who de&s;ign'd to &s;urprize <HI>Penelope,</HI> and told her, that he was her
husband; and to confirm it, pretended to remember a Bow,
which he u&s;ed before he went to the &s;iege of <HI>Troy.</HI> This &s;hews
that <HI>Penelope</HI> had been in danger from impo&s;tors, and it is there|fore
very prudent in her to be upon the guard, and not to yield
without full conviction.</P>
<P>But there is a di&s;pute of a different nature mention'd by Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Bayle;</HI> namely, whether if <HI>Penelope</HI> had yielded to an impo|&s;tor,
believing him to be really <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> &s;he had been guilty of
adultery? Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ba&s;nage</HI> thus argues: &startq;Let us &s;uppo&s;e a
wife tran&s;ported with love for an husband, running eagerly to
the per&s;on &s;he mi&s;takes for him: This woman has no de&s;ign
to be deceived, one cannot blame her ardor; it is lawful, if he
proves her real husband: in &s;hort, her ignorance is involuntary,
and occa&s;ion'd &s;olely by a laudable pa&s;&s;ion for her husband:
Yet, if this per&s;on prove an adulterer, is the wife entirely ex|cu&s;able?
ought her eagerne&s;s and precipitation to give her
no unea&s;ine&s;s? Undoubtedly it ought, becau&s;e &s;he is &s;uppos'd to
act precipitately, without a full examination: her pa&s;&s;ion is
&s;tronger than her rea&s;on, and therefore &s;he is blameable.&endq; The
Author of the General Critique on <HI>Maimbourg</HI> is more indul|gent:
He judges that if a woman does not refu&s;e a &s;trict exami|nation
out of a blameable motive, &s;he is excu&s;able, tho' &s;he hap|pens
to oblige an impo&s;tor. &startq;If a wife, deceived by the re|&s;emblance
between her husband and an impo&s;tor, &s;hall allow
the latter all the privileges of the marriage-bed, this action is
no &s;tain to her cha&s;tity; and the husband would be the mo&s;t
<PB N="196" REF="193">
unrea&s;onable creature breathing, &s;hould he blame it as a breach
of conjugal fidelity, provided &s;he is no way acce&s;&s;ary to the
impo&s;ition.&endq; So that according to this Author, tho' the wife
is betray'd by her precipitation, yet &s;he is to be accounted inno|cent;
becau&s;e the precipitation is occa&s;ion'd by a vehemence of
love for her husband. But I fear few husbands who &s;hould take
their wives in &s;uch circum&s;tances would excu&s;e them, or believe
that they had us'd due circum&s;pection. In &s;hort, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bayle</HI>
rightly decides the que&s;tion, by &s;aying, that every per&s;on who
acts precipitately is culpable; and that no per&s;on can act ratio|nally,
without a full and &s;atisfactory examination. And indeed if
this rule were ob&s;erv'd, there would &s;carce be any room for the afore|&s;aid
&s;uppo&s;ition. The re&s;emblance between man and man is never
&s;o perfect, but the difference upon a &s;trict ob&s;ervation is di&s;cernible;
we may therefore conclude, that a wife who &s;hould &s;uffer &s;uch a
deceit, was not very unwilling to be deceiv'd; e&s;pecially when there
mu&s;t be between a man and wife a thou&s;and particularities, which
could only be known to the wife and husband, which upon a
due &s;crutiny would di&s;cover the impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>I fear I &s;hall be tedious to the Reader, by mentioning ano|ther
difficulty of a &s;imilar nature &s;tarted by <HI>Seneca.</HI> &startq;If any
per&s;on &s;hould make an a&s;&s;ignation with his own wife in di&s;|gui&s;e,
&s;uppo&s;ing her to be the wife of another per&s;on, would
he be guilty of adultery?&endq; He an&s;wers in the affirmative;
tho' the wife her &s;elf would be innocent; for he is guilty inten|tionally.
This may be illu&s;trated by the example of <HI>Jacob,</HI>
who was blamele&s;s when he was deceiv'd by <HI>Leah,</HI> who per&s;ona|ted
his wife <HI>Rachel;</HI> but <HI>Leah</HI> was culpable, tho' <HI>Jacob</HI> was in|nocent,
for &s;he very well knew that &s;he was not wife to <HI>Jacob.</HI>

We are not to gather from this tran&s;port of <HI>Penelope,</HI> that &s;he is
fully convinc'd of the return of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> She is yet incredulous;
but &s;he mu&s;t have been in&s;en&s;ible if &s;he had continu'd unmov'd
at the mention of the arrival of an husband, who&s;e return has
been de&s;crib'd thro' the whole <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> as the chief object of all
her de&s;ires. Be&s;ides, &s;he receives the death of the Suitors with
joy; &s;he cannot disbelieve the te&s;timony of <HI>Euryclea</HI> concerning
their deaths; but thinking it impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould be &s;lain
by any one per&s;on, &s;he a&s;cribes their de&s;truction not to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> but
a Deity. But then is not &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition extravagant? and
can it be reconcil'd to probability, that a God &s;hould really be
&s;uppos'd to de&s;cend to work their de&s;truction? It may be an|&s;wer'd,
that the exce&s;s of the a&s;&s;ertion ought to be a&s;crib'd to the
exce&s;s of joy in the &s;peaker: <HI>Penelope</HI> is in a tran&s;port, and no
wonder if &s;he &s;peaks with amplification: &s;he judges it impo&s;&s;ible
that &s;uch a great event &s;hould be wrought by a mortal hand;
and it is therefore very natural, while &s;he is under a &s;urprize, and
her thoughts rais'd above the bounds of calm Rea&s;on, to a&s;cribe
it to a Deity.</P>
<P>It has been believ'd that all the notions of good and bad Dae|mons
that prevail'd among the Ancients were borrow'd from
truth, and that they received them by tradition from the offices
of good and bad Angels: If I might be allow'd to make this
&s;uppo&s;ition, then what <HI>Penelope</HI> here &s;peaks may be reconcil'd to
&s;trict verity; then we may find a rea&s;on why &s;he may without

evidence of her veracity: what method then could the Poet
take to carry on <HI>Penelope</HI>'s incredulity, and give her room to re|&s;i&s;t
&s;uch evidence with any appearance of rea&s;on? This is very
well explain'd by <HI>Eu&s;tathius. Penelope</HI> (ob&s;erves that Author) an|&s;wers
with profound wi&s;dom; her words are &s;hort, but contain
excellent truth and morality: This is her meaning: &startq;<HI>Euryclea,</HI>
you appeal to your &s;en&s;es for the truth of your affirmation:
you &s;aw the wound, and touch'd it as you bath'd him; and
he forbad you to make a di&s;covery of his per&s;on: from hence
you conclude, that it is <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> who has &s;lain the Suitors; not
remembring that the Gods are able thus to &s;hew them&s;elves

do you know but this is a God? Are you able to know the

whence we may gather, that it was believ'd to be an undeniable
truth, that the divine Beings &s;ometimes a&s;&s;um'd the &s;hape of man,
and appear'd vi&s;ibly upon earth. Such expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e might
almo&s;t per&s;uade us of the reality of a former conjecture, that

<P>But it may be objected, that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is a King, and therefore
above apprehen&s;ions of puni&s;hment. 'Tis true, <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is a King,
yet &s;ubject to the laws; his government was not &s;o de&s;potic, as
to have no rea&s;on to fear the re&s;entments of the chief families of
his &s;ubjects, who&s;e heirs were &s;lain by his hand. I cannot en|tirely
agree with <HI>Dacier</HI> in this la&s;t &s;entiment: <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had only
done an act of ju&s;tice upon the&s;e offenders, and had tran&s;gre&s;s'd no
law by it, and ought therefore to apprehend no vengeance from
the law. I &s;hould rather a&s;cribe the apprehen&s;ions of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to a
fear of a &s;udden a&s;&s;ault from the friends of the Suitors before he
could di&s;cover him&s;elf to be the real <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> He is afraid of an

the rea&s;on of this conduct: The Suitors had been accu&s;to|med
to retire from the Palace, and &s;leep in other places by night:
<PB N="205" REF="202">
it would therefore have alarm'd the whole city, and made them
apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome calamity had befallen them, if there had
not appeared a &s;eeming rea&s;on why they return'd not to their &s;e|veral
hou&s;es as u&s;ual: <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> therefore invents this &s;tratagem to
deceive them into an opinion that they &s;tay'd to celebrate the
Queen's nuptials. But there appears to be a &s;trong objection
again&s;t this part of the relation; we have already &s;een the Sui|tors
&s;lain, without being heard by the <HI>Ithacans</HI> of the city; is it
then probable that the &s;ound of the mu&s;ic &s;hould be heard abroad,
when the cries, &s;houts and groans, during the fight were not heard
out of the Palace? Was the mu&s;ic louder than the&s;e united noi&s;es?
It is not ea&s;y to &s;olve this difficulty, unle&s;s we are allow'd to ima|gine
that the more than u&s;ual &s;tay of the Suitors in the Palace
had rais'd the curio&s;ity of &s;ome of the <HI>Ithacans</HI> to enquire the
rea&s;on of it; who con&s;equently approaching the Palace might
hear the mu&s;ic and dancing, and conclude that it was occa&s;ion'd
by the Queen's marriage. Be&s;ides, in the &s;tillne&s;s of the night, a
lower &s;ound may be further heard, than one more loud, during

<P>VERSE 183. <HI>Thus &s;peaks the Queen, &s;till dubious</HI>&mdash;] It mu&s;t
be allow'd that this is a very artful turn of thought in <HI>Penelope.
Uly&s;&s;es</HI> commands a bed to be prepar'd, <HI>Penelope</HI> catches the word,
and &s;eeming to con&s;ent, orders <HI>Euryclea</HI> to carry the bed out of
the bridal apartment, and prepare it. Now this bed was of &s;uch a
nature as to be inwrought into the &s;ub&s;tance of the apartment
it &s;elf, and could not be remov'd; if therefore <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had ac|quie&s;c'd
in the injunction given by <HI>Penelope,</HI> and not di&s;cover'd the
impo&s;&s;ibility of it, &s;he might very ju&s;tly have concluded him an
impo&s;tor, being manife&s;tly ignorant of the &s;ecret of his own
marriage-bed.</P>
<P>But <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> &s;tarts an objection again&s;t this whole proce&s;s
of the di&s;covery, which he calls in&s;olvible; and indeed if <HI>Homer</HI>
fails in the unravelling of his Poem, he is to be &s;everely blam'd:
<HI>Tully</HI> is of this opinion, <HI>Illic enim debet toto animo a poet&acirc; in di&s;&s;o|lutionem
<PB N="208" REF="205">
nodi agi; eaque praecipua fabulae pars e&s;t, quae requirit dili|gentiam.</HI>
The difficulty rais'd by <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> is as follows: <HI>Pene|lope</HI>
imagines that the per&s;on who pretends to be her husband,
is not really <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> but a God, who not only a&s;&s;umes his form,
but, to favour the impo&s;ture, the re&s;emblance of the wound re|ceiv'd
from the boar: Now if he be a God, how is it po&s;&s;ible
&s;he &s;hould conceive him to be ignorant of the &s;ecret of the mar|riage-bed,
and con&s;equently how can &s;he be convinc'd of the re|ality
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> from his knowledge of it, when it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
be known to a God, as well as to the real <HI>Uly&s;&s;es?</HI> all that
&s;he ought to gather from it is, that the per&s;on with whom &s;he
&s;peaks is <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> or a God. <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> replies, that <HI>Penelope</HI> up|on
the di&s;covery of the &s;ecret makes no &s;cruple to yield; becau&s;e
whether it be <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> or a God, her ca&s;e is happy: if he prove
to be <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> &s;he has her wi&s;hes; if a God, it is no &s;mall piece of
good fortune. <HI>Dacier</HI> condemns this &s;olution, and tells us, that
<HI>Penelope</HI> was &s;o faithful to her husband, that &s;he would not have
receiv'd even a God into the place of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> The true an&s;wer (con|tinues
that Author) is to be drawn from the Pagan Theology,
according to which the inferior Deities were &s;uppos'd to have a
finite knowledge, and con&s;equently <HI>Penelope</HI> might think the
di&s;covery of the nature of the nuptial-bed a full conviction of
the reality of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> it being &s;o great a &s;ecret that even a God
might be ignorant of it. But this is all fancy; for allowing this
per&s;on to be a God, why might not <HI>Penelope</HI> imagine him to be
a Deity of the &s;uperior order, and for that rea&s;on well acquainted
with the &s;ecrets of this nuptial bow'r? e&s;pecially becau&s;e <HI>Jupiter</HI>
him&s;elf was notorious for &s;uch amorous illu&s;ions. <HI>Dacier</HI> her &s;elf
confe&s;&s;es this to be no ju&s;t &s;olution, but gives a very different
rea&s;on: How is it po&s;&s;ible (&s;ays &s;he) that this bed and whole apart|ment
&s;hould be built by the &s;ingle hand of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> without be|ing
&s;een by any per&s;on while he builds it? or how can any one
be a&s;&s;ured that a &s;ecret that is known to a third per&s;on (<HI>Actoris</HI>)
is not thro' weakne&s;s or intere&s;t di&s;covered to others? 'Tis true,
the manner of the di&s;covery entirely depends upon the choice of
the Poet, but I could wi&s;h that he had cho&s;en a method more
<PB N="209" REF="206">
probable than this of the nuptial bed, which in my judgment
(continues the &s;ame Author) is unworthy of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> I am
per&s;uaded that this is one of the places where (as <HI>Horace</HI> writes)
<HI>Homer</HI> nods.</P>
<P>I will lay together what occurs to me by way of reply. The
fir&s;t objection is, that <HI>Penelope</HI> imagines <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to be a God, and
con&s;equently his knowledge of the nuptial bed ought not to
have induc'd her to believe him to be the real <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> The an|&s;wer
is, <HI>Penelope</HI> thought him a God only during her fir&s;t
tran&s;port; it is to be imputed to her &s;urprize, that &s;he at all thinks
him a Deity: This is very evident, for from the moment &s;he
&s;aw him, the thought of his divinity vani&s;hes, and &s;he never men|tions
one word concerning &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, nay from the fir&s;t
glance &s;he almo&s;t believes him to be the real <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI>
<Q><L>O'er all the man her eyes &s;he rolls in vain,</L>
<L>Now hopes, now fears, now knows, then doubts again.</L></Q>
She is &s;o far from thinking him a Deity, that &s;he is almo&s;t per|&s;uaded
that he is her husband. If this be allow'd, the fir&s;t diffi|culty
cea&s;es: For granting her belief that the per&s;on before her is
a real man, and that no man but <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was acquainted with
the nuptial bed; it follows, that this man is the real <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and
that this incident is not ill cho&s;en by the Poet, in the di&s;covery
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dacier</HI> objects, that this apartment could not po&s;&s;ibly be erect|ed
without being known to other per&s;ons; but we have &s;een <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es</HI>
build a &s;hip in a &s;olitary I&s;land, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
any man, in the fifth <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey;</HI> and why may he not then be al|low'd
to do the &s;ame, with re&s;pect to this nuptial bower? All
kind of arts in Mechanics were anciently practis'd by the great|e&s;t
per&s;onages, and their knowledge and dexterity in them was
e&s;teem'd a glory. This con&s;ideration may perhaps reconcile the
Reader to this part of the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The only difficulty that now remains is this: <HI>Actoris,</HI> a female
&s;ervant, is allow'd to be in the &s;ecret; how then can <HI>Penelope</HI> be
<PB N="210" REF="207">
a&s;&s;ur'd that &s;he has not betray'd it? <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf obviates
this objection; he has in a very &s;olemn manner told us, that on|ly
twelve of all the female train were guilty of a breach of tru&s;t,
and therefore <HI>Penelope</HI> may &s;afely rely upon the fidelity of <HI>Acto|ris.</HI>
Be&s;ides, it adds no &s;mall weight to this vindication of <HI>Ho|mer,</HI>
to ob&s;erve, that the whole procedure of the di&s;covery is ac|cidental;
how could <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> fore-know that the proof of his ve|racity
would depend upon his knowledge of the bridal bower?
and con&s;equently it is not to be imagin'd that he &s;hould have
made any clande&s;tine enquiries about it: It may be added,
that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> has been no more than five days upon the <HI>Ithacan</HI>
&s;hores, and probably had never &s;een <HI>Actoris,</HI> who alone was ac|quainted
with the nature of this bed: no per&s;on was anciently
permitted to enter the womens apartment, but fathers, husbands,
or brothers; this therefore was the greate&s;t &s;ecret in all families;
this &s;ecret <HI>Penelope</HI> propo&s;es in the tryal of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and upon his
knowledge of it receives him as her husband. To in&s;tance al|mo&s;t
in a parallel ca&s;e; <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> in <HI>Euripides</HI> tells <HI>Iphigenia,</HI> that
the lance which <HI>Pelops</HI> u&s;ed in the combat again&s;t <HI>Aenomaus</HI> was
lodg'd in her apartment; this circum&s;tance convinces her that
the per&s;on who knew this &s;ecret mu&s;t be her brother <HI>Ore|&s;tes,</HI>
no per&s;ons of a more di&s;tant relation being admitted into

<PB N="215" REF="212">
the remaining part of this book and the whole 24th &s;uppo&s;ititious:
tho&s;e who were of a contrary opinion reply'd, that by ending
the Poem with that ver&s;e, many incidents of great importance
would be rejected; for in&s;tance, the recapitulation of the whole
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> and e&s;pecially the di&s;covery of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to his father <HI>Laer|tes,</HI>
with all the beatiful fictions contain'd in it. They add, that
if the little relation that the beginning of that book bears to the
&s;ubject of the Poem be a rea&s;on for the rejection of it, we mu&s;t
for the &s;ame rea&s;on abridge the Poem, and reject a multitude of
the Fables which are &s;catter'd thro' the whole cour&s;e of it. It may
therefore be conjectured that <HI>Ari&s;tarchus</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> were
not of opinion that the Poem ended with this ver&s;e, but only
the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and important incidents. <HI>Ca&s;aubon</HI> in a remark
upon a pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Strabo,</HI> favours the opinion of <HI>Ari&s;tarchus,</HI> for
he there &s;peaks of the la&s;t book as if he &s;u&s;pected it to be &s;puri|ous;
and <HI>Rapin</HI> joyns in the &s;ame judgment. <HI>Homer</HI> is to be de|fended
in another manner, than by &s;uch arguments as are brought
in an&s;wer to <HI>Ari&s;tarchus.</HI> The &s;ame objection has been made
again&s;t the two la&s;t books of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> as again&s;t the&s;e of the <HI>O|dy&s;&s;ey;</HI>
the former ought to have ended with the deci&s;ive action
in the death of <HI>Hector,</HI> and the latter with the di&s;covery of <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es</HI>
to <HI>Penelope,</HI> when his happine&s;s &s;eems to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd. But
there is no weight in the&s;e objections. There is a difference
between the <HI>unravelling</HI> of the action, and the full <HI>accompli&s;hment</HI>
of it; the Action is unravell'd by the death of the Suitors; but
there are con&s;equences ari&s;ing from their deaths that hinder the
accompli&s;hment of the action; namely, the danger of the re|&s;entments
of their friends, who ri&s;e in arms to revenge their &s;laugh|ter;
and till their in&s;urrection is pacify'd, <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> cannot be &s;aid
to be in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity. The &s;ubject of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is the Anger
of <HI>Achilles;</HI> that of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> the Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in
his dominions; now the anger of <HI>Achilles</HI> ends not with the death
of <HI>Hector,</HI> nor is <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> fully re-e&s;tabli&s;hed by the death of the
Suitors; he has another ob&s;tacle to overcome, and till the com|motions
of the <HI>Ithacans</HI> are appeas'd, the de&s;ign of the Poem is
not executed, which is to &s;hew <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in peaceful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="216" REF="213">
his Palace and Authority. We &s;ee in this very book, that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
is forc'd to fly from his own Palace; can he then be &s;aid to be
re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd in tranquillity? this very action demon&s;trates, that
what follows is part of the &s;ubject of the Poem, and &s;uch a part,
as if it had not been related, would have given us room to have
imagin'd that <HI>Homer</HI> had never fini&s;h'd it, or that the conclu&s;i|on
of it had been lo&s;t. The beginning of the Action is his
&s;ailing from <HI>Troy</HI> toward his country; the middle contains all
the calamities he &s;u&s;tains in his return, the di&s;orders of his family
before and after it; and the end of the Action is his re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
in the peaceful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdoms, when he is ac|knowledg'd
by his wife, father, family, and &s;ubjects: now this
is not compleated till the very end of the la&s;t book, and con&s;e|quently
that book is not &s;purious, but e&s;&s;ential. The Poet had
ended very injudiciou&s;ly, if he had &s;topp'd before; for the Rea|der

how he was made known to <HI>Laertes,</HI> and what vengeance the

he will &s;ee the difference between a clear, and an ob&s;cure Writer.
<HI>Tibullus</HI> in his <HI>Panegyric</HI> on <HI>Me&s;&s;ala</HI> has been more &s;ucce&s;sful than

<HI>Dacier</HI> is of opinion, that this recapitulation in <HI>Homer</HI> has a very
good effect. I will tran&s;late her ob&s;ervation. We learn from it,
that the &s;ubject of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> is not alone the return of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
to his country, and his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment in it; but that it com|prehends
all his wandrings and all his voyages; all that he &s;aw,
or &s;uffer'd in his return to it; in a word, all that he underwent
after he &s;et &s;ail from the &s;hores of <HI>Troy:</HI> Another advantage we
reap from it is, that we &s;ee the order and train of the adven|tures
of his Heroe, as they really happen'd, naturally and hi&s;to|rically:
for in his relation of them in his Poem, he u&s;es an ar|tificial
order; that is, he begins at the latter end, and finds an
opportunity to in&s;ert all that precedes the opening of his Poem by
way of narration to the <HI>Phaeacians:</HI> Here he &s;ets every event in its
natural order, &s;o that with a glance of the eye we may di&s;tingui&s;h
what gives continuity to the action, and what is comprehended
in it. By this method we are able to &s;eparate the time of the du|ration
of the Poem, from the time of the duration of the Acti|on;
for in reality the Poem begins many years before the return
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> but <HI>Homer</HI> begins his action but thirty five days be|fore
<PB N="218" REF="215">
he lands in his own country. In the cour&s;e therefore of
the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey, Homer</HI> gave us the artificial, here the natural or|der;

The &s;tory of the&s;e oxen is fully related, <HI>lib.</HI> 12. I refer to the
Annotations. The crime of the companions of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
was &s;acrilege, they having de&s;troy'd the herds &s;acred to a
God. The&s;e herds were &s;aid to be immortal: I have there given
the rea&s;on of it, but too conci&s;ely, and will therefore add a &s;up|plement
from the <HI>Polyhymnia</HI> of <HI>Herodotus;</HI> I ought to have men|tion'd,
that the body of &s;oldiers call'd Immortal, was a &s;elect num|ber
of men in the army of <HI>Xerxes:</HI> &s;o nam'd, becau&s;e upon the
death of any one of their number, whether by war or &s;ickne&s;s,
another was immediately &s;ub&s;tituted into his room, &s;o that they
never amounted to more or le&s;s than ten thou&s;and. If we apply
this piece of Hi&s;tory to the herds of <HI>Apollo,</HI> it excellently explains
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Poetry: they are call'd Immortal, becau&s;e upon the death
of any one of the whole herd, another was brought into its
place; they are &s;aid neither to increa&s;e nor decay, becau&s;e they
were always of a fix'd number, and continually &s;upply'd upon
any vacancy.</P>
<P>The Reader will be appriz'd of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the crime

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
TWENTY-FOURTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_IT has been already prov'd, that this book is
the genuine work of <HI>Homer;</HI> but perhaps
the Reader may not be di&s;pleas'd to &s;ee the
rea&s;ons why it was rejected by &s;o great a
Critic as <HI>Ari&s;tarchus:</HI> I &s;hall therefore lay
them before him from <HI>Didymus</HI> and <HI>Spon|danus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;tarchus</HI> affirms, that this is the only
place in <HI>Homer,</HI> where <HI>Mercury</HI> performs the office of conduct|ing
the &s;ouls of the dead; and that there is no proof he was
known &s;o early by the title of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; that this is the
only pa&s;&s;age where he is call'd <HI>Cyllenius;</HI> that the ceremony of
his guiding the &s;ouls is contrary to other de&s;criptions of <HI>Ho|mer,</HI>
where they all de&s;cend without a guide into the man&s;ions
of the dead, even before the funeral rites. That it is ab&s;urd to
imagine a <HI>white rock</HI> in the&s;e kingdoms of darkne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To the&s;e
<HI>Didymus</HI> thus replies. If a &s;ingle mention of any incident in <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
were a rea&s;on for its rejection, abundance of pa&s;&s;ages mu&s;t
<PB N="260" REF="255">
be rejected. He thinks it a &s;ufficient argument, that <HI>Mercury</HI> was
call'd <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and <HI>Cyllenius</HI> in the days of <HI>Homer,</HI> that he
is here mention'd under the&s;e titles; but this is begging the que&s;ti|on.
He adds, that altho' the &s;ouls of the dead de&s;cend without
a guide in other places, this hinders not but they may de&s;cend
with one; for they are in other places only &s;aid in general to
de&s;cend, whereas here the manner of their de&s;cent is particulari|zed.
Neither is it any objection again&s;t this book, to &s;ay that
it is contrary to the manner of <HI>Homer</HI> to de&s;cribe the &s;hades of
the dead receiv'd immediately into the &s;tate of <HI>Achilles, Agamem|non,</HI>
&amp;c. before the performance of their funeral ceremonies;
this (&s;ays he) is a favour granted by <HI>Mercury</HI> to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who
was de&s;cended from that Deity, he being the father of <HI>Arci|&s;ius</HI>
and con&s;equently great grandfather to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> It was the
opinion of the Ancients, that the &s;hades of the deceas'd could
vi&s;it the earth before the ob&s;equies were fini&s;h'd, but not after|wards;
this is evident from the words of <HI>Patroclus, Iliad</HI> 23.
<Q><L>&mdash;To the further &s;hore,</L>
<L>When once we pa&s;s, the &s;oul returns no more.</L></Q>
It is therefore out of favour to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> that <HI>Mercury</HI> introduces
the&s;e &s;hades into the region where <HI>Agamemnon</HI> re&s;ided, before the
funeral ceremonies, that they might not return to earth and di&s;|quiet
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> But there may be a &s;tronger objection made
again&s;t the former part of this book; namely, that this is
an Epi&s;ode which has no relation to the principal &s;ubject,
and that we may retrench it without de&s;troying any part of
the Action e&s;&s;ential to the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI> But it may be an&s;wer'd,
that tho' it makes no part of the principal Action, yet it
has a &s;ufficient connection with it: it is the &s;equel of the
death of the Suitors, and con&s;equently the principal Action is
the cau&s;e of it; it is drawn and deduc'd from it, and <HI>Homer</HI> makes
a very happy u&s;e of it to adorn and diver&s;ify his Poem, with the
Hi&s;tory of what happen'd before <HI>Troy,</HI> after the conclu&s;ion of the
<PB N="261" REF="256">
<HI>Iliad;</HI> and in particular, with the death of <HI>Achilles,</HI> and a de|&s;cription
of his funeral ceremonies. <HI>Didymus, Dacier.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> in the beginning of his third Dialogue, <HI>de Repub.</HI> brings
an heavy charge again&s;t <HI>Homer,</HI> for the di&s;advantageous character
he gives of a future &s;tate. He quotes the &s;imilitude of the Bats,
and affirms that the dreadful de&s;cription of the condition of the
dead, mu&s;t deter mankind from hazarding their lives, even in the
cau&s;e of their country. &startq;Let us then (&s;ays that Author) with
the permi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Homer</HI> and other Poets, reject &s;uch relati|ons,
not becau&s;e they are unpoetical, not becau&s;e they are
unplea&s;ant to read, but becau&s;e by how much they are
more plea&s;ant and poetical, by &s;o much they are more dange|rous,
and to be kept from our youth, and men, who are born
to a&s;&s;ert their liberty with the hazard of their lives, and prefer
death to &s;lavery.&endq; It mu&s;t be allow'd that this is &s;trong rea|&s;oning,
and it is not ea&s;y to guard the doctrine of <HI>Homer</HI> from
&s;uch unhappy con&s;equences; for why &s;hould men chu&s;e to die, ra|ther
than be &s;laves, when by death they fall into a wor&s;e condition?
It will not be an an&s;wer to &s;ay that <HI>Homer</HI> a&s;&s;erts a threefold &s;tate
in futurity; <HI>viz.</HI> of the &s;oul, the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <HI>vehicle,</HI> and the
body: and that while the <HI>vehicle</HI> is in this condition of hor|rors,
the &s;oul may be happy; for &s;till the &s;tate of the dead is re|pre&s;ented
as a &s;tate of horror, and man is in part (namely, in
his <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">) mi&s;erable after death: Nay &s;o mi&s;erable, that even
<HI>Hercules,</HI> who was a God and receiv'd among&s;t the Deities,
is yet tormented in Hell; <HI>lib.</HI> XI.

<L>And clang their pinions with terrific &s;ound,</L>
<L>Gloomy as night he &s;tands, in act to throw</L>
<L>Th' aerial arrow from the twanging bow.</L></Q>
It will indeed be a vindication of <HI>Homer</HI> as a Poet, to &s;ay, that
he wrote according to the opinion of his age; and that &s;uch as was
the notion of the Ancients of a future &s;tate, &s;uch is his de&s;cription
<PB N="262" REF="257">
of it. I will only add, that we may collect from <HI>Plato,</HI> that
he judg'd this book genuine, for he quotes this pa&s;&s;age as
<HI>Homer</HI>'s.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 17. <HI>And</HI> Leucas' <HI>rock</HI>&mdash;] This de&s;cription of
the de&s;cent into hell is more particular than that in the XIth
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey;</HI> and each particular is well &s;uited to the &s;ubject; the de|&s;cent
is fabled to be by the Ocean, becau&s;e the Sun &s;eems to
de&s;cend thro' it into Night or the region of darkne&s;s, in the we|&s;tern
parts of Heaven. <HI>Milton</HI> fables the Sun to ri&s;e thro' the
gates of light, after the manner of the Ancients.
<Q><L>&mdash;'Till morn,</L>
<L>Wak'd by the circling hours, with ro&s;y hand</L>
<L>Unbarr'd the gates of light&mdash;</L></Q>
The circum&s;tance likewi&s;e of going thro' the region of <HI>dreams</HI> is
well cho&s;en; Dreams are the attendants of &s;leep, the brother of
death; they come by night, and are therefore well imagin'd
to have relation to the kingdom of death, and to be introducto|ry
to it; <HI>Virgil</HI> in the de&s;cent of <HI>Aeneas</HI> into hell, has borrow'd
this image,
<Q><L>&mdash;Quam &s;edem &s;omnia vulgo</L>
<L>Vana tenere ferunt&mdash;</L></Q>
<Q><L>The God of &s;leep there hides his heavy head,</L>
<L>And empty dreams on every leaf are &s;pread.</L></Q>
The only circum&s;tance liable to objection is, the <HI>Leucadian,</HI> or
<HI>white</HI> rock, which <HI>Ari&s;tarchus</HI> thought improperly placed in the road
to the realms of darkne&s;s; but (replies <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI>) this is only meant
<PB N="263" REF="258">
of a rock &s;tanding on the extremities of the earth, or a rock
on which the la&s;t rays of the Sun fall. <HI>Dacier</HI> imagines, that
there is a further meaning in the expre&s;&s;ion: &startq;There is an I&s;land
over-again&s;t <HI>Acarnania,</HI> on the we&s;t of <HI>Ithaca,</HI> call'd <HI>Leucas,</HI>
from a white rock &s;tanding in it; this rock was famous in
antiquity, becau&s;e lovers in de&s;pair threw them&s;elves from the
top of it into the ocean; it was call'd <HI>the Lover's leap,</HI> and
being thus remarkable for the deaths of numbers of people,
<HI>Homer</HI> places it here.&endq; This is no ill explication; for a rock
may well be feign'd to &s;tand at the entrance of the region of
death, by which &s;o many per&s;ons had enter'd into it.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid</HI> in his <HI>Epi&s;tles</HI> mentions this <HI>Leucadian</HI> rock.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;O you that love in vain,</L>
<L><HI>Fly hence, and &s;eek the far</HI> Leucadian <HI>main:</HI></L>
<L>There &s;tands a rock from who&s;e impending &s;teep,</L>
<L>Apollo'<HI>s fane &s;urveys the rolling deep;</HI></L>

<L>Their flames extingui&s;h, and forget to love.</L></Q>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 35. <HI>O mighty chief!</HI> (Pelides <HI>thus began</HI>) &amp;c.] This
appears to be introduc'd &s;omewhat unnaturally: <HI>Achilles</HI> had
now been dead about ten years, and <HI>Agamemnon</HI> almo&s;t as long;
it can therefore &s;carce be reconcil'd to probability, to imagine
that they &s;hould not have met before this time, and mutually
have &s;atisfy'd their curio&s;ities, by relating their &s;everal &s;tories at
&s;ome former interview: <HI>Dacier</HI> indeed remarks, that we are not
to imagine this conference was held at the time when the Sui|tors
de&s;cended, but upon &s;ome preceding occa&s;ion, immediately
after the death of <HI>Agamemnon.</HI> If this be allow'd, yet the ob|jection
remains, that the introduction is forc'd and unnatural,
for then the de&s;cent of <HI>Mercury</HI> and the &s;hades of the Suitors
will be no rea&s;on why this conference &s;hould be here repeat|ed;
for &s;o, neither <HI>Mercury</HI> nor the Suitors hear it. But
<PB N="264" REF="259">
<HI>Dacier</HI> is undoubtedly in an error; for <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in the original is the
third per&s;on plural, and ab&s;olutely refers to <HI>Mercury</HI> and the &s;hades
of the Suitors; and therefore it follows that this conference hap|pen'd
at the time of their entrance.</P>
<P>The &s;hades of the Suitors (ob&s;erves <HI>Dacier</HI>) when they are &s;um|mon'd
by <HI>Mercury</HI> out of the Palace of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> emit a feeble
plaintive, inarticulate &s;ound, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>&s;trident:</HI> Whereas <HI>Agamem|non</HI>
and the &s;hades that have long been in the &s;tate of the dead
&s;peak articulately. I doubt not but <HI>Homer</HI> intended to &s;hew by
the former de&s;cription, that when the &s;oul is &s;eparated from the
organs of the body, it cea&s;es to act after the &s;ame manner, as
while it was joyn'd to it; but how the dead recover their voices
afterwards is not &s;o ea&s;y to under&s;tand. In other re&s;pects <HI>Virgil</HI>
paints after <HI>Homer.</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;pars tollere vocem</L>
<L>Exiguam: inceptus clamor fru&s;tratur hiantes.</L></Q>
<Q><L>They rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes,</L>
<L>But the weak voice deceiv'd their ga&s;ping throats. <HI>Dryden.</HI></L></Q>
But why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e with <HI>Dacier,</HI> that the&s;e &s;hades of the
Suitors have lo&s;t the faculty of &s;peaking? I rather imagine, that
the &s;ounds they utter'd were &s;igns of complaint and di&s;content,
and proceeded not from an inability to &s;peak: After <HI>Patroclus</HI>
was &s;lain, he appears to <HI>Achilles,</HI> and &s;peaks very articulately
to him; yet to expre&s;s his &s;orrow at his departure he acts like
the&s;e Suitors: for <HI>Achilles</HI>
<Q><L>Like a thin &s;moke beholds the &s;pirit fly,</L>
<L>And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.</L></Q>
<HI>Dacier</HI> conjectures, that the power of &s;peech cea&s;es in the dead,
till they are admitted into a &s;tate of re&s;t; but <HI>Patroclus</HI> is an
in&s;tance to the contrary in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and <HI>Elpenor</HI> in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="260">
for they both &s;peak before their funeral rites are perform'd, and
con&s;equently before they enter into a &s;tate of repo&s;e among&s;t the
&s;hades of the happy.</P>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 56. <HI>Great, and terrific ev'n in death</HI>&mdash;] There is
a very peculiar beauty in the ver&s;ification of <HI>Homer</HI> in this place:

<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</L></Q>
The words <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;et the largene&s;s of the body of
<HI>Achilles</HI> &s;tretch'd out upon the ground full before our eyes; we
&s;ee him in the de&s;cription; the repetition forces it upon our ob|&s;ervation,
&s;o that the mind has time to dwell upon it, and ad|mire
the extent of the limbs of that Heroe.</P>

<P>VERSE 68.&mdash;<HI>Terror &s;eiz'd the</HI> Grecian <HI>train.]</HI> This de|&s;cription
furni&s;h'd <HI>Ari&s;tarchus</HI> with another objection to this book:
He thought it improbable that the appearance of <HI>Thetis</HI> and her
Sea-nymphs &s;hould terrify the whole <HI>Grecian</HI> army: they &s;ay in
an&s;wer, that all the ocean was in a great commotion as <HI>Thetis</HI>
a&s;cended, or as <HI>Homer</HI> expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q><L>&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.&mdash;</L></Q>
This uproar occa&s;ion'd their fear; the <HI>Greeks</HI> were ignorant of
the cau&s;e of it, and con&s;equently apprehended &s;ome dreadful
event; this is evident, for <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> appea&s;es their con&s;ternation by
unfolding the rea&s;on of the tumult, and &s;hewing them that it was
occa&s;ion'd by the a&s;cent of <HI>Thetis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="261">
The Reader has undoubtedly ob&s;erv'd how excellently <HI>Homer</HI>
&s;u&s;tains his characters; <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> is the wi&s;e&s;t man, both in the <HI>Ili|ad</HI>
and <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI> he has the experience of a very great age, and
may therefore be &s;uppos'd to be acquainted with all the mo&s;t un|common
appearances in nature: The Poet accordingly de&s;cribes
him as the only per&s;on not afraid in the <HI>Grecian</HI> army: there were
others undoubtedly as brave as <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> but no one &s;o wi&s;e; his
intrepidity is therefore to be imputed to his wi&s;dom, not brave|ry,
and this furni&s;hes us with an excellent moral; That igno|rance
is u&s;ually the &s;ource of fear.</P>
<P>The character of <HI>Achilles</HI> is no le&s;s happily &s;upported; the &s;ame
love of glory is vi&s;ible in all he &s;peaks, that di&s;tingui&s;h'd his
character thro' the <HI>Iliad:</HI> he &s;till prefers a &s;hort life with fame,
before old age without it.
<Q><L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,</L>

The &s;entiment is truly heroic; di&s;honour is wor&s;e than death,
the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of which is not to be mea&s;ured by time,
but glory; long life is but lengthen'd mortality, and they who

of it, why might he not mention it? <HI>Ari&s;tarchus</HI> further adds,
that it is ab&s;urd to imagine the body of <HI>Achilles</HI> could be
pre&s;erv'd &s;eventeen days without burial; but this may be a&s;crib'd
to the power of <HI>Thetis,</HI> who may ea&s;ily be &s;uppos'd to pre&s;erve it.
Be&s;ides, why might not the body be embalm'd? and then there
will be no occa&s;ion for a miracle, and the interpo&s;ition of a

for the actions of the &s;ame man are &s;o many and different, that
we can never reduce them to unity: For this rea&s;on <HI>Homer</HI> men|tions

to the &s;ubject of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey;</HI> he knew that this counter|feit
madne&s;s had no connexion either in truth or probability with
the &s;ubject of his Poem, and therefore he forbears the mention
of it. The Reader will under&s;tand the meaning of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> if
he con&s;iders that the &s;ubject of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> is the &s;tory of a per|&s;on
who &s;uffers great calamities in the return to his country; before
he e&s;tabli&s;hes him&s;elf in his dominions: Now the counterfeited
madne&s;s of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> has no connection with the&s;e &s;ufferings, and
con&s;equently is judiciou&s;ly omitted by <HI>Homer</HI> as foreign to the
de&s;ign of the Poem, and contrary to the unity of the action.
A detail of all the adventures of an Heroe's life is the province
of Hi&s;tory; the relation of one &s;ingle, great, and &s;urprizing action

of the Soul, into which &s;he de&s;cended as into a pri&s;on,
from above; this was thought the &s;epulchre of the &s;oul, and
the cave of <HI>Pluto.</HI> The river of Oblivion denotes the error
of the &s;oul, which forgets the Maje&s;ty of the former &s;tate &s;he
enjoy'd before &s;he enter'd the body: <HI>Phlegethon,</HI> the ardor of
our de&s;ires, and flames of anger: <HI>Acheron</HI> all our words and
actions that bring us into &s;orrows; &s;o likewi&s;e, <HI>Styx</HI> implies
our hatred, <HI>Cocytus</HI> our grief and lamentation. Thus al&s;o the
puni&s;hments in hell are verify'd upon earth: the Vultur which
preys upon the liver of <HI>Tityus,</HI> is the &s;ting of a guilty con&s;ci|ence;
the ambitious man is the <HI>Si&s;yphus,</HI> who is eternally a&s;|piring,

This is the fir&s;t appearance of <HI>Laertes,</HI> he is the very picture of
melancholy, his dre&s;s, his employ, and &s;olitary life all di&s;cover a
fix'd &s;orrow and contempt of the world. It has been a di&s;pute

&s;pirit, who for&s;akes his &s;tation, and is unequal to adver&s;ity; or to
wi&s;dom, and a noble neglect of the pomp and &s;plendor of the
<PB N="275" REF="270">
world, by which he prefers a little rural retreat to all the mag|nificence
of a Palace, and a &s;mall garden to all the dominions
of a King. <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;everely cen&s;ures his conduct: &startq;A per&s;on
(ob&s;erves that writer) who wa&s;tes his age in his bed, or in tri|vial
affairs, makes him&s;elf an object of contempt, as <HI>Homer</HI>
teaches by the examples of <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Laertes: Ne&s;tor,</HI> by en|gaging
in the war of <HI>Troy,</HI> obtain'd the utmo&s;t veneration;
while <HI>Laertes,</HI> who abandon'd him&s;elf to &s;olitude, was de&s;pis'd
univer&s;ally.&endq; I am unwilling to &s;ub&s;cribe to this ob&s;ervation,
being of opinion that the &s;ilent virtues of a good man in &s;oli|tude
are more amiable than all the noi&s;y honours of active life.
The picture of <HI>Laertes</HI> is undoubtedly drawn very naturally; a
tender father is afflicted for the lo&s;s of a brave and beloved &s;on,
this bitter ingredient gives a di&s;reli&s;h to all the vanities of life;
he is depriv'd of an object that he valu'd above the world, he
therefore neglects it, as having nothing worthy of his cares, and
abandons it for privacy and tranquillity. <HI>Menedemus</HI> in <HI>Terence</HI>
is the very copy of <HI>Laertes</HI> in <HI>Homer;</HI> an in&s;tance that he thought
<HI>Homer</HI>'s an exact repre&s;entation of human nature: and the applau&s;e
with which that Comedy was receiv'd, &s;hews that all <HI>Rome</HI> was of
the &s;ame judgment. Sorrow loves to be alone, it rather &s;eeks for
amu&s;ements than bu&s;ine&s;s and glory; and it may perhaps be
true, that it &s;hews more greatne&s;s of &s;oul to re&s;ign a kingdom
than to conquer it. Pride, ambition, and guilty pa&s;&s;ions have
rais'd many to the top of human glory; but it evidences that a
per&s;on is not influenced by vicious &s;entiments, who knows how
to moderate his de&s;ires, and is able to retire from the &s;plendor
of a Crown into ob&s;curity. <HI>Tully</HI> mentions the manner of life
in <HI>Laertes,</HI> without condemnation; the place is to be found in his
<HI>Cato Major,</HI> where he &s;peaks of the innocent amu&s;ements of old
age, and illu&s;trates his a&s;&s;ertions by the example of <HI>Laertes. Ho|merus

come to the conclu&s;ion, it is an argument that it is of too
large an extent, and its Length de&s;troys its Beauty. What
&s;eems to favour this deci&s;ion is, that the <HI>Aeneid, Iliad,</HI> and

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. POPE.</BYLINE>
<P>_I Cannot di&s;mi&s;s this work without a few
ob&s;ervations on the true Character and
Style of it. Whoever reads the Ody&s;&s;ey
with an eye to the Iliad, expecting
to find it of the &s;ame character, or
of the &s;ame &s;ort of &s;pirit, will be grievou&s;ly deceiv|ed,
and err again&s;t the fir&s;t principle of Criti|ci&s;m,
which is to con&s;ider the nature of the piece,
and the intent of its author. The Ody&s;&s;ey is a
moral and political work, in&s;tructive to all degrees
of men, and filled with images examples and pre|cepts,
of civil and dome&s;tic life. <HI>Homer</HI> is here a
per&s;on
<Q><L><HI>Qui didicit</HI> patriae <HI>quid debeat, &amp; quid</HI> amicis,</L>
<L><HI>Quo &s;it amore</HI> parens, <HI>quo</HI> frater <HI>amandus, &amp;</HI> ho&s;pes:</L>
<L><HI>Qui quid &s;it</HI> pulcrum, <HI>quid</HI> turpe, <HI>quid</HI> utile, <HI>quid</HI> non,</L>
<L>Plenius &amp; melius Chry&s;ippo &amp; Crantore dicit.</L></Q>
The Ody&s;&s;ey is the rever&s;e of the Iliad, in <HI>Moral,
Subject, Manner</HI> and <HI>Style;</HI> to which it has no &s;ort
<PB N="290" REF="285">
of relation, but as the &s;tory happens to follow in
order of time, and as &s;ome of the &s;ame per&s;ons
are actors in it. Yet from this incidental connexi|on
many have been mi&s;-led to regard it as a con|tinuation
or &s;econd part, and thence to expect a
parity of character incon&s;i&s;tent with its nature.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that the common Reader
&s;hould fall into this mi&s;take, when &s;o great a
Critic as <HI>Longinus</HI> &s;eems not wholly free from it.
Although what he has &s;aid has been generally un|der&s;tood
to import a &s;everer cen&s;ure of the Ody&s;|&s;ey
than it really does, if we con&s;ider the occa&s;i|on
on which it is introduced, and the circum&s;tan|ces
to which it is confined.</P>
<P>&startq;The Ody&s;&s;ey (&s;ays he) is an in&s;tance, how na|tural
it is to a great Genius, when it begins
to grow old and decline, to delight it &s;elf in
<HI>Narrations</HI> and <HI>Fables.</HI> For, that <HI>Homer</HI>
compo&s;ed the Ody&s;&s;ey after the Iliad, many
proofs may be given, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From hence in my
judgment it proceeds, that as the Iliad was writ|ten
while his <HI>Spirit</HI> was in its greate&s;t vigor, the
whole &s;tructure of that work is Dramatick and full
of action; whereas the greater part of the O|dy&s;&s;ey
is employ'd in Narration, which is the ta&s;te
of <HI>Old Age:</HI> So that in this latter piece we may
compare him to the &s;etting Sun, which has &s;till
<PB N="291" REF="286">
the &s;ame greatne&s;s but not the &s;ame ardor, or
force. He &s;peaks not in the &s;ame &s;train; we
&s;ee no more that <HI>Sublime</HI> of the Iliad which
marches on with a con&s;tant pace, without ever
being &s;topp'd, or retarded: there appears no
more that hurry and that &s;trong tyde of mo|tions
and pa&s;&s;ions, pouring one after another:
there is no more the &s;ame fury, or the &s;ame
volubility of diction, &s;o &s;uitable to action, and
all along drawing in &s;uch innumerable images of
nature. But <HI>Homer,</HI> like the Ocean, is always
great, even when he ebbs and retires; even when
he is lowe&s;t and lo&s;es him&s;elf mo&s;t in Narra|tions
and incredible Fictions: As in&s;tances of this,
we cannot forget the de&s;criptions of tempe&s;ts,
the adventures of <HI>&V;ly&s;&s;es</HI> with the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> and
many others. But tho' all this be <HI>Age,</HI> it is
the <HI>Age</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI>&mdash;And it may be &s;aid
for the credit of the&s;e fictions, that they are
<HI>beautiful Dreams,</HI> or if you will, the <HI>Dreams
of</HI> Jupiter <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> I &s;poke of the Ody&s;&s;ey on|ly
to &s;how, that the greate&s;t Poets when
their genius wants &s;trength and warmth for the
<HI>Pathetic,</HI> for the mo&s;t part employ them&s;elves
in painting the <HI>Manners.</HI> This <HI>Homer</HI> has done,
in characterizing the Suitors, and de&s;cribing their
way of life; which is properly a branch of Co|medy,
<PB N="292" REF="287">
who&s;e peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s it is to repre&s;ent
the manners of men.&endq;</P>
<P>We mu&s;t fir&s;t ob&s;erve, it is the <HI>Sublime</HI> of which
<HI>Longinus</HI> is writing: That, and not the nature of
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem, is his &s;ubject. After having highly
extoll'd the &s;ublimity and fire of the Iliad, he ju&s;tly
ob&s;erves the Ody&s;&s;ey to have le&s;s of tho&s;e qualities,
and to turn more on the &s;ide of moral, and refle|ctions
on human life. Nor is it his bu&s;ine&s;s here to
determine, whether the <HI>elevated &s;pirit</HI> of the one,
or the <HI>ju&s;t moral</HI> of the other, be the greater ex|cellence
in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Secondly, that fire and fury of which he is &s;peak|ing,
can not well be meant of the general Spirit and
In&s;piration which is to run through a whole Epic
Poem, but of that particular warmth and impe|tuo&s;ity
nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome parts, to image or
repre&s;ent actions or pa&s;&s;ions, of ha&s;te, tumult, and
violence. It is on occa&s;ion of citing &s;ome &s;uch
particular pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Homer,</HI> that <HI>Longinus</HI> breaks
into this reflection; which &s;eems to determine his
meaning chiefly to that &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, he affirms the Ody&s;&s;ey to have
le&s;s &s;ublimity and fire than the Iliad, but he does
not &s;ay it wants the &s;ublime or wants fire. He
affirms it to be narrative, but not that the nar|ration
is defective. He affirms it to abound in
<PB N="293" REF="288">
fictions, not that tho&s;e fictions are ill invented, or
ill executed. He affirms it to be nice and parti|cular
in painting the manners, but not that tho&s;e
manners are ill painted. If <HI>Homer</HI> has fully in the&s;e
points accompli&s;h'd his own de&s;ign, and done all
that the nature of his Poem demanded or allowed,
it &s;till remains perfect in its kind, and as much
a ma&s;ter-piece as the Iliad.</P>
<P>The Amount of the pa&s;&s;age is this; that in his
own particular ta&s;te, and with re&s;pect to the <HI>Sub|lime,
Longinus</HI> preferr'd the Iliad: And becau&s;e the
Ody&s;&s;ey was le&s;s active and lofty, he judged it the
work of the old age of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>If this opinion be true, it will only prove, that
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Age might determine him in the choice of
his &s;ubject, but not that it affected him in the ex|ecution
of it: And that which would be a very wrong
in&s;tance to prove the decay of his Imagination, is a
very good one to evince the &s;trength of his Judg|ment.
For had he (as Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> ob&s;erves) com|pos'd
the Ody&s;&s;ey in his youth, and the Iliad in his
age, both mu&s;t in rea&s;on have been exactly the
&s;ame as they now &s;tand. To blame <HI>Homer</HI> for his
choice of &s;uch a &s;ubject, as did not admit the &s;ame
incidents and the &s;ame pomp of &s;tyle as his for|mer;
is to take offence at too much variety, and
to imagine, that when a man has written one
<PB N="294" REF="289">
good thing, he mu&s;t ever after only copy him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Battle of</HI> Con&s;tantine, and the <HI>School of</HI> A|thens,
are both pieces of <HI>Raphael:</HI> Shall we cen&s;ure
the School of <HI>Athens</HI> as faulty, becau&s;e it has not the
fury and fire of the other? or &s;hall we &s;ay, that <HI>Ra|phael</HI>
was grown grave and old, becau&s;e he cho&s;e to
repre&s;ent the manners of old men and Philo&s;ophers?
There is all the &s;ilence, tranquillity and compo&s;ure
in the one, and all the warmth, hurry and tumult
in the other, which the &s;ubject of either required:
both of them had been imperfect, if they had not
been as they are. And let the Painter or Poet
be young or old, who de&s;igns and performs in this
manner, it proves him to have made the piece at
a time of life when he was ma&s;ter not only of his
art, but of his di&s;cretion.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> makes no &s;uch di&s;tinction between the
two Poems: He con&s;tantly cites them with equal
prai&s;e, and draws the rules and examples of Epic
writing equally from both. But it is rather to the
Ody&s;&s;ey that <HI>Horace</HI> gives the preference, in the E|pi&s;tle
to <HI>Lollius,</HI> and in the Art of Poetry. It is
remarkable how oppo&s;ite his opinion is to that of
<HI>Longinus;</HI> and that the particulars he chu&s;es to ex|toll,
are tho&s;e very <HI>fictions</HI> and <HI>pictures of the man|ners</HI>
which the other &s;eems lea&s;t to approve. Tho&s;e
<PB N="295" REF="290">
fables and manners are of the very e&s;&s;ence of the
work: But even without that regard, the fables them|&s;elves
have both more invention and more in&s;truction,
and the manners more moral and example, than tho&s;e
of the Iliad.</P>
<P>In &s;ome points (and tho&s;e the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to
the Epic Poem) the Ody&s;&s;ey is confe&s;&s;ed to excel the
Iliad; and principally in the great end of it, the <HI>Mo|ral.</HI>
The conduct, turn, and di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Fable</HI>
is al&s;o what the Criticks allow to be the better
model for Epic writers to follow: Accordingly we
find much more of the Ca&s;t of this Poem than of the
other in the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and (what next to that is perhaps
the greate&s;t example) in the <HI>Telemachus.</HI> In the <HI>Man|ners,</HI>
it is no way inferior: <HI>Longinus</HI> is &s;o far from
finding any defect in the&s;e, that he rather taxes <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
with painting them too minutely. As to
the <HI>Narrations,</HI> although they are more nume|rous
as the occa&s;ions are more frequent, yet they
carry no more the marks of old age, and are neither
more prolix nor more circum&s;tantial, than the con|ver&s;ations
and dialogues of the Iliad. Not to men|tion
the length of tho&s;e of <HI>Phaenix</HI> in the ninth book,
and of <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> in the eleventh (which may be thought
in compliance to their characters) tho&s;e of <HI>Glaucus</HI>
in the &s;ixth, of <HI>Aeneas</HI> in the twentieth, and &s;ome
others, mu&s;t be allow'd to exceed any in the whole
<PB N="296" REF="291">
Ody&s;&s;ey. And that the propriety of &s;tyle, and the
numbers, in the Narrations of each are equal, will
appear to any who compare them.</P>
<P>To form a right judgment, whether the Genius
of <HI>Homer</HI> had &s;uffer'd any decay; we mu&s;t con&s;i|der,
in both his poems, &s;uch parts as are of a &s;imi|lar
nature, and will bear compari&s;on. And it is
certain we &s;hall find in each, the &s;ame vivacity and
fecundity of invention, the &s;ame life and &s;trength of
imaging and colouring, the particular de&s;criptions
as highly painted, the figures as bold, the metaphors
as animated, and the numbers as harmonious and
as various.</P>
<P>The Ody&s;&s;ey is a perpetual &s;ource of Poetry: The
&s;tream is not the le&s;s full, for being gentle; tho' it
is true (when we &s;peak only with regard to the <HI>Sub|lime</HI>)
that a river, foaming and thund'ring in cataracts
from rocks and precipices, is what more &s;trikes, a|mazes
and fills the mind, than the &s;ame body of
water, flowing afterwards thro' peaceful vales and
agreeable &s;cenes of pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>The Ody&s;&s;ey (as I have before &s;aid) ought to be
con&s;ider'd according to its own nature and de&s;ign,
not with an eye to the Iliad. To cen&s;ure <HI>Homer</HI>
becau&s;e it is unlike what it was never meant to re|&s;emble,
is, as if a Gardiner who had purpo&s;ely cul|tivated
two beautiful trees of contrary natures, as a
<PB N="297" REF="292">
&s;pecimen of his skill in the &s;everal kinds, &s;hould
be blamed for not bringing them into <HI>pairs;</HI> when
in root, &s;tem, leaf, and flower, each was &s;o entirely
different, that one mu&s;t have been &s;poil'd in the en|deavour
to match the other.</P>
<P><HI>Longinus,</HI> who &s;aw this Poem was &startq;<HI>partly of the
nature of Comedy,</HI>&endq; ought not for that very rea&s;on
to have con&s;ider'd it with a view to the Iliad. How
little any &s;uch re&s;emblance was the intention of <HI>Ho|mer,</HI>
may appear from hence, that although the
character of <HI>&V;ly&s;&s;es</HI> there was already drawn, yet
here he purpo&s;ely turns to another &s;ide of it,
and &s;hows him not in that full light of glory but
in the &s;hade of common life, with a mixture of
&s;uch qualities as are requi&s;ite to all the lowe&s;t acci|dents
of it, &s;trugling with misfortunes, and on a
level with the meane&s;t of mankind. As for the o|ther
per&s;ons, none of them are above what we call
the higher Comedy: <HI>Calyp&s;o,</HI> tho' a Godde&s;s, is a
character of intrigue; the <HI>Suitors</HI> are yet more
approaching to it; the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> are of the &s;ame
ca&s;t; the <HI>Cyclops, Melanthius,</HI> and <HI>Irus,</HI> de&s;cend
even to droll characters: and the &s;cenes that appear
throughout, are generally of the comic kind; ban|quets,
revels, &s;ports, loves, and the pur&s;uit of a
woman.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="293">
From the Nature of the Poem, we &s;hall form an
Idea of the <HI>Style.</HI> The diction is to follow the ima|ges,
and to take its colour from the complexion of
the thoughts. Accordingly the Ody&s;&s;ey is not al|ways
cloath'd in the maje&s;ty of ver&s;e proper to Tra|gedy,
but &s;ometimes de&s;cends into the plainer Narra|tive,
and &s;ometimes even to that familiar dialogue e&s;|&s;ential
to Comedy. However, where it cannot &s;up|port
a &s;ublimity, it always pre&s;erves a dignity, or at
lea&s;t a propriety.</P>
<P>There is a real beauty in an ea&s;y, pure, per&s;pi|cuous
de&s;cription even of a <HI>low action.</HI> There are
numerous in&s;tances of this both in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Vir|gil;</HI>
and perhaps tho&s;e natural pa&s;&s;ages are not the
lea&s;t plea&s;ing of their works. It is often the &s;ame
in Hi&s;tory, where the repre&s;entations of common, or
even dome&s;tic things, in clear, plain, and natural
words, are frequently found to make the livelie&s;t
impre&s;&s;ion on the reader.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is, how far a Poet, in pur&s;uing the
de&s;cription or image of an action, can attach him&s;elf
to <HI>little circum&s;tances,</HI> without vulgarity or trifling?
what particulars are proper, and enliven the image;
or what are impertinent, and clog it? In this matter
Painting is to be con&s;ulted, and the whole regard
had to tho&s;e circum&s;tances which contribute to form
a full, and yet not a confu&s;ed, idea of the thing.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="294">
<HI>Epithets</HI> are of va&s;t &s;ervice to this effect, and the
right u&s;e of the&s;e is often the only expedient to ren|der
the narration poetical.</P>
<P>The great point of judgment is to di&s;tingui&s;h
when to &s;peak &s;imply, and when figuratively: But
whenever the Poet is oblig'd by the nature of his
&s;ubject to de&s;cend to the lower manner of wri|ting,
an elevated &s;tyle would be affected, and
therefore ridiculous; and the more he was forc'd up|on
figures and metaphors to avoid that lowne&s;s, the
more the image would be broken, and con&s;equenly
ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>One may add, that the u&s;e of the grand &s;tyle on
little &s;ubjects, is not only ludicrous, but a &s;ort of
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion again&s;t the rules of proportion and me|chanicks:
'Tis u&s;ing a va&s;t force to lift a <HI>feather.</HI></P>
<P>I believe, now I am upon this head, it will be
found a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that the <HI>low actions of life</HI>
cannot be put into a figurative &s;tyle without being ri|diculous,
but <HI>things natural</HI> can. Metaphors rai&s;e
the latter into Dignity, as we &s;ee in the <HI>Georgicks;</HI>
but throw the former into Ridicule, as in the <HI>Lutrin.</HI>
I think this may very well be accounted for: Laugh|ter
implies cen&s;ure; inanimate and irrational beings
are not objects of cen&s;ure; therefore the&s;e may be
elevated as much as you plea&s;e, and no ridicule fol|lows:
but when rational beings are repre&s;ented above
<PB N="300" REF="295">
their real character, it becomes ridiculous in Art,
becau&s;e it is vicious in Morality. The <HI>Bees</HI> in <HI>Vir|gil,</HI>
were they rational beings, would be ridiculous
by having their actions and manners repre&s;ented on
a level with creatures &s;o &s;uperior as men; &s;ince it
would imply folly or pride, which are the proper ob|jects
of Ridicule.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of pompous expre&s;&s;ion for low actions or
thoughts is the <HI>true Sublime</HI> of <HI>Don Quixote.</HI> How
far unfit it is for Epic Poetry, appears in its being
the perfection of the Mock-Epick. It is &s;o far
from being the Sublime of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> that it is the
cau&s;e of all <HI>Bomba&s;te;</HI> when Poets in&s;tead of being
(as they imagine) con&s;tantly lofty, only pre&s;erve
throughout a painful equality of fu&s;tian: That con|tinu'd
&s;well of language (which runs indi&s;criminately
even thro' their lowe&s;t characters, and rattles like
&s;ome mightine&s;s of meaning in the mo&s;t indiffe|rent
&s;ubjects) is of a piece with that perpetual
elevation of tone which the Players have learn|ed
from it; and which is not <HI>&s;peaking,</HI> but <HI>vocife|rating.</HI></P>
<P>There is &s;till more rea&s;on for a variation of &s;tyle
in <HI>Epic</HI> Poetry than in <HI>Tragic,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween
that <HI>Language of the Gods</HI> proper to the <HI>Mu&s;e</HI>
who &s;ings, and is in&s;pir'd; and that of <HI>Men</HI> who are
introduced &s;peaking only according to nature. Far|ther,
<PB N="301" REF="296">
there ought to be a difference of &s;tyle ob|&s;erv'd
in the &s;peeches of human per&s;ons, and tho&s;e
of Deities; and again, in tho&s;e which may be called
&s;et harangues or orations, and tho&s;e which are only
conver&s;ation or dialogue. <HI>Homer</HI> has more of the latter
than any other Poet: what <HI>Virgil</HI> does by two or three
words of narration, <HI>Homer</HI> &s;till performs by &s;peeches:
Not only replies, but even rejoynders are frequent in
him, a practice almo&s;t unknown to <HI>Virgil.</HI> This ren|ders
his Poems more animated, but le&s;s grave and ma|je&s;tic;
and con&s;equently nece&s;&s;itates the frequent u&s;e
of a lower &s;tyle. The writers of Tragedy lye under the
&s;ame nece&s;&s;ity, if they would copy nature; whereas
that painted and poetical diction which they perpetually
u&s;e, would be improper even in Orations de&s;ign'd to
move with all the arts of Rhetorick: This is plain
from the practice of <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Cicero;</HI> and
<HI>Virgil</HI> in tho&s;e of <HI>Drances</HI> and <HI>Turnus</HI> gives an e|minent
example, how far remov'd the &s;tyle of them
ought to be from &s;uch an exce&s;s of figures and or|naments:
which indeed fits only that <HI>Language of
the Gods</HI> we have been &s;peaking of, or that of a
<HI>Mu&s;e</HI> under in&s;piration.</P>
<P>To read thro' a whole work in this &s;train, is like
travelling all along on the ridge of a hill; which is
not half &s;o agreeable as &s;ometimes gradually to ri&s;e,
and &s;ometimes gently to de&s;cend, as the way leads,
and as the end of the journey directs.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="297">
Indeed the true rea&s;on that &s;o few Poets have imi|tated
<HI>Homer</HI> in the&s;e lower parts, has been the ex|treme
difficulty of pre&s;erving that mixture of Ea&s;e
and Dignity e&s;&s;ential to them. For it is as hard for an
Epic Poem to &s;toop to the Narrative with &s;ucce&s;s, as
for a Prince to de&s;cend to be familiar, without dimi|nution
to his greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ublime</HI> &s;tyle is more ea&s;ily counterfeited than
the <HI>natural;</HI> &s;omething that pa&s;&s;es for it, or &s;ounds
like it, is common in all fal&s;e writers: But nature,
purity, per&s;picuity, and &s;implicity, never walk in the
clouds; they are obvious to all capacities; and
where they are not evident, they do not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t plain Narration not only admits of the&s;e,
and of harmony (which are all the qualities of &s;tyle)
but it requires every one of them to render it plea|&s;ing.
On the contrary, whatever pretends to a
&s;hare of the Sublime, may pa&s;s notwith&s;tanding any
defects in the re&s;t, nay &s;ometimes without any of them,
and gain the admiration of all ordinary readers.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> in his lowe&s;t narrations or &s;peeches is e|ver
ea&s;y, flowing, copious, clear, and harmonious.
He &s;hows not le&s;s <HI>invention,</HI> in a&s;&s;embling the hum|bler,
than the greater, thoughts and images; nor le&s;s
<HI>judgment,</HI> in proportioning the &s;tyle and the ver&s;ifica|tion
to the&s;e, than to the other. Let it be remem|ber'd,
that the &s;ame Genius that &s;oar'd the highe&s;t,
<PB N="303" REF="298">
and from whom the greate&s;t models of the <HI>Sublime</HI>
are derived, was al&s;o he who &s;toop'd the lowe&s;t, and
gave to the &s;imple <HI>Narrative</HI> its utmo&s;t perfection.
Which of the&s;e was the harder task to <HI>Homer</HI>
him&s;elf, I cannot pretend to determine; but to his
Tran&s;lator I can affirm (however unequal all his
imitations mu&s;t be) that of the latter has been much
the more difficult.</P>
<P>Whoever expects here the &s;ame pomp of ver&s;e,
and the &s;ame ornaments of diction, as in the Iliad;
he will, and he ought to be di&s;appointed. Were the
original otherwi&s;e, it had been an offence again&s;t na|ture;
and were the tran&s;lation &s;o, it were an offence
again&s;t <HI>Homer,</HI> which is the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allow'd that there is a maje&s;ty and
harmony in the <HI>Greek</HI> language which greatly con|tribute
to elevate and &s;upport the narration. But
I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve that this is an advantage grown
upon the language &s;ince <HI>Homer</HI>'s time; for things are
remov'd from vulgarity by being out of u&s;e: And
if the words we could find in any pre&s;ent language
were equally &s;onorous or mu&s;ical in them&s;elves,
they would &s;till appear le&s;s poetical and uncommon
than tho&s;e of a dead one from this only circum|&s;tance,
of being in every man's mouth. I may add
to this another di&s;advantage to a Tran&s;lator, from a
different cau&s;e: <HI>Homer</HI> &s;eems to have taken upon
<PB N="304" REF="299">
him the character of an Hi&s;torian, Antiquary, Di|vine,
and Profe&s;&s;or of Arts and Sciences; as well
as a Poet. In one or other of the&s;e characters he
de&s;cends into many particularities, which as a Poet
only perhaps he would have avoided. All the&s;e
ought to be pre&s;erv'd by a faithful Tran&s;lator, who
in &s;ome mea&s;ure takes the place of <HI>Homer;</HI> and all
that can be expected from him is to make them as
poetical as the &s;ubject will bear. Many arts there|fore
are requi&s;ite to &s;upply the&s;e di&s;advantages, in
order to dignify and &s;olemnize the&s;e plainer parts,
which hardly admit of any poetical ornaments.</P>
<P>Some u&s;e has been made to this end, of the &s;tyle
of <HI>Milton.</HI> A ju&s;t and moderate mixture of old
words may have an effect like the working old Abbey
&s;tones into a building, which I have &s;ometimes &s;een
to give a kind of venerable air, and yet not de&s;troy
the neatne&s;s, elegance, and equality requi&s;ite to a
new work; I mean without rendring it too unfami|liar,
or remote from the pre&s;ent purity of writing, or
from that ea&s;e and &s;moothne&s;s which ought always
to accompany Narration or Dialogue. In reading
a &s;tyle judiciou&s;ly antiquated, one finds a plea&s;ure
not unlike that of travelling on an old <HI>Roman</HI> way:
but then the road mu&s;t be as <HI>good,</HI> as the way is
<HI>ancient;</HI> the &s;tyle mu&s;t be &s;uch in which we may
evenly proceed, without being put to &s;hort &s;tops by
<PB N="305" REF="300">
&s;udden abruptne&s;&s;es, or puzled by frequent turnings
and tran&s;po&s;itions: No man delights in furrows and
&s;tumbling-blocks: And let our love to Antiquity
be ever &s;o great, a fine ruin is one thing, and a heap
of rubbi&s;h another. The imitators of <HI>Milton,</HI> like
mo&s;t other imitators, are not <HI>Copies</HI> but <HI>Caricatura's</HI>
of their original; they are a hundred times more
ob&s;olete and cramp than he, and equally &s;o in all
places: Whereas it &s;hould have been ob&s;erved of
<HI>Milton,</HI> that he is not lavi&s;h of his exotick words
and phra&s;es every where alike, but employs them
much more where the &s;ubject is marvellous va&s;t
and &s;trange, as in the &s;cenes of Heaven, Hell,
Chaos, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than where it is turn'd to the natural
and agreeable, as in the pictures of Paradi&s;e, the
loves of our fir&s;t parents, the entertainments of
Angels, and the like. In general, this unu&s;ual &s;tyle
better &s;erves to awaken our ideas in the de&s;criptions
and in the imaging and picture&s;que parts, than it
agrees with the lower &s;ort of narrations, the character
of which is &s;implicity and purity. <HI>Milton</HI> has &s;e|veral
of the latter, where we find not an antiquated
affected or uncouth word, for &s;ome hundred lines
together; as in his fifth book, the latter part of
the eighth, the former of the tenth and eleventh
books, and in the narration of <HI>Michael</HI> in the twelfth.
I wonder indeed that he, who ventur'd (contrary
<PB N="306" REF="301">
to the practice of all other Epic Poets) to imitate
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Lowne&s;&s;es in the <HI>Narrative,</HI> &s;hould not al&s;o
have copied his plainne&s;s and per&s;picuity in the
<HI>Dramatic</HI> parts: Since in his &s;peeches (where clear|ne&s;s
above all is nece&s;&s;ary) there is frequently &s;uch
tran&s;po&s;ition and forced con&s;truction, that the
very &s;en&s;e is not to be di&s;cover'd without a &s;econd or
third reading: And in this certainly he ought to
be no example.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve the true character of <HI>Homer</HI>'s &s;tyle
in the pre&s;ent tran&s;lation, great pains has been taken
to be ea&s;y and natural. The chief merit I can
pretend to, is, not to have been carried into a
more plau&s;ible and figurative manner of writing,
which would better have plea&s;ed all readers, but the
judicious ones. My errors had been fewer, had
each of tho&s;e Gentlemen who join'd with me
&s;hown as much of the &s;everity of a friend to me,
as I did to them, in a &s;trict animadver&s;ion and cor|rection.
What a&s;&s;i&s;tance I receiv'd from them, was
made known in general to the publick in the origi|nal
Propo&s;als for this work, and the particulars
are &s;pecify'd at the conclu&s;ion of it; to which I
mu&s;t add (to be punctually ju&s;t) &s;ome part of the
tenth and fifteenth books. The Reader will
now be too good a judge, how much the
greater part of it, and con&s;equently of its faults, is
<PB N="307" REF="302">
chargeable upon me alone. But this I can with in|tegrity
affirm, that I have be&s;towed as much time
and pains upon the whole, as were con&s;i&s;tent with
the indi&s;pen&s;able duties and cares of life, and with
that wretched &s;tate of health which God has been
plea&s;ed to make my portion. At the lea&s;t, it is a
plea&s;ure to me to reflect, that I have introduced
into our language this other work of the great|e&s;t
and mo&s;t ancient of Poets, with &s;ome dignity;
and I hope, with as little di&s;advantage as the Iliad.
And if, after the unmerited &s;ucce&s;s of that tran&s;lati|on,
any one will wonder why I would enterprize
the Ody&s;&s;ey? I think it a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to &s;ay,
that <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf did the &s;ame, or the world would
never have &s;een it.</P>
<P>I de&s;ign'd to have ended this Po&s;t&s;cript here;
but &s;ince I am now taking my leave of <HI>Homer,</HI> and
of all controver&s;y relating to him, I beg leave to
be indulg'd if I make u&s;e of this la&s;t opportunity,
to &s;ay a very few words about &s;ome reflections which
the late Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> be&s;tow'd on the fir&s;t part
of my Preface to the Iliad, and which &s;he publi&s;h'd
at the end of her tran&s;lation of that Poem<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Seconde Edition, a Paris, 1719.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To write gravely an an&s;wer to them would be
too much for the reflections; and to &s;ay nothing
<PB N="308" REF="303">
concerning them, would be too little for the Au|thor.
It is owing to the indu&s;try of that learned
Lady, that our polite neighbours are become ac|quainted
with many of <HI>Homer</HI>'s beauties, which were
hidden from them before in <HI>Greek</HI> and in <HI>Eu&s;ta|thius.</HI>
She challenges on this account a particular
regard from all the admirers of that great Poet,
and I hope that I &s;hall be thought, as I mean, to
pay &s;ome part of this debt to her memory in what
I am now writing.</P>
<P>Had the&s;e reflections fallen from the pen of an
ordinary Critick, I &s;hould not have apprehended
their effect, and &s;hould therefore have been &s;ilent
concerning them: but &s;ince they are Madam <HI>Da|cier</HI>'s,
I imagine that they mu&s;t be of weight; and
in a ca&s;e where I think her Rea&s;oning very bad, I re|&s;pect
her Authority.</P>
<P>I have fought under Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>'s banner,
and have wag'd war in defence of the divine <HI>Homer</HI>
again&s;t all the Hereticks of the age. And yet it is
Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> who accu&s;es me, and who accu&s;es
me of nothing le&s;s than betraying our common
Cau&s;e. She affirms that the mo&s;t declar'd enemies
of this Author have never &s;aid any thing again&s;t
him more injurious or more unju&s;t than I.
What mu&s;t the world think of me, after &s;uch
a judgment pa&s;s'd by &s;o great a Critick? the
<PB N="309" REF="304">
world, who decides &s;o often, and who examines &s;o
&s;eldom; the world, who even in matters of littera|ture
is almo&s;t always the &s;lave of Authority? Who
will &s;u&s;pect that &s;o much learning &s;hould mi&s;take,
that &s;o much accuracy &s;hould be mi&s;-led, or that
&s;o much candour &s;hould be bya&s;s'd?</P>
<P>All this however has happen'd, and Madam <HI>Da|cier</HI>'s
Critici&s;ms on my Preface flow from the very
&s;ame error, from which &s;o many fal&s;e critici&s;ms of
her countrymen upon <HI>Homer</HI> have flow'd, and
which &s;he has &s;o ju&s;tly and &s;o &s;everely reprov'd; I
mean the error of depending on injurious and un|skilful
<HI>tran&s;lations.</HI></P>
<P>An indifferent tran&s;lation may be of &s;ome u&s;e,
and a good one will be of a great deal. But I think
that no tran&s;lation ought to be the ground of <HI>Cri|tici&s;m,</HI>
becau&s;e no man ought to be condemn'd up|on
another man's explanation of his meaning: Could
<HI>Homer</HI> have had the honour of explaining his, before
that augu&s;t Tribunal where Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Motte</HI> pre|&s;ides,
I make no doubt but he had e&s;cap'd many
of tho&s;e &s;evere animadver&s;ions with which &s;ome
<HI>French</HI> Authors have loaded him, and from which
even Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>'s tran&s;lation of the Iliad could
not pre&s;erve him.</P>
<P>How unhappy was it for me, that the knowledge
of our <HI>I&s;land-tongue</HI> was as nece&s;&s;ary to Madam
<PB N="310" REF="305">
<HI>Dacier</HI> in my ca&s;e, as the knowledge of <HI>Greek</HI> was
to Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Motte</HI> in that of our great Au|thor;
or to any of tho&s;e whom &s;he &s;tyles <HI>blind Cen|&s;urers,</HI>
and blames for condemning what they did
not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>I may &s;ay with mode&s;ty, that &s;he knew le&s;s of
my true &s;en&s;e from that faulty tran&s;lation of part
of my Preface, than tho&s;e blind cen&s;urers might
have known of <HI>Homer</HI>'s even from the tran&s;lation of
<HI>la Valterie,</HI> which preceded her own.</P>
<P>It pleas'd me however to find, that her objecti|ons
were not level'd at the general Doctrine, or at
any e&s;&s;entials of my Preface, but only at a few par|ticular
expre&s;&s;ions. She propos'd little more than
(to u&s;e her own phra&s;e) to <HI>combate two or three Si|miles;</HI>
and I hope that to combate a Simile is no
more than to fight with a &s;hadow, &s;ince a Simile is
no better than the &s;hadow of an Argument.</P>
<P>She lays much weight where I lay'd but little, and
examines with more &s;crupulo&s;ity than I writ, or than
perhaps the matter requires.</P>
<P>The&s;e unlucky Similes taken by them&s;elves may
perhaps render my meaning equivocal to an igno|rant
tran&s;lator; or there may have fallen from my
pen &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, which taken by them&s;elves
likewi&s;e, may to the &s;ame per&s;on have the &s;ame ef|fect.
But if the tran&s;lator had been ma&s;ter of our
<PB N="311" REF="306">
tongue, the general tenor of my argument, that
which precedes and that which follows the pa&s;&s;ages
objected to, would have &s;ufficiently determined him
as to the preci&s;e meaning of them: And if Ma|dam
<HI>Dacier</HI> had taken up her pen a little more lei|&s;urely,
or had employ'd it with more temper, &s;he
would not have an&s;wered Paraphra&s;es of her own,
which even the tran&s;lation will not ju&s;tify, and which
&s;ay more than once the very contrary to what I have
&s;aid in the pa&s;&s;ages them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If any per&s;on has curio&s;ity enough to read the
whole paragraphs in my Preface, on &s;ome mangled
parts of which the&s;e reflections are made, he will ea|&s;ily
di&s;cern that I am as orthodox as Madam <HI>Da|cier</HI>
her &s;elf in tho&s;e very articles on which &s;he treats
me like an Heretick: He will ea&s;ily &s;ee that all the dif|ference
between us con&s;i&s;ts in this, that I offer <HI>opini|ons,</HI>
and &s;he delivers <HI>doctrines;</HI> that my imagination
repre&s;ents <HI>Homer</HI> as the greate&s;t of human Po|ets,
whereas in hers he was exalted above humani|ty;
infallibility and impeccability were two of his
attributes. There was therefore no need of defend|ing
<HI>Homer</HI> again&s;t me, who (if I mi&s;take not) had
carry'd my admiration of him as far as it can be car|ry'd
without giving a <HI>real</HI> occa&s;ion of writing in his
defence.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="307">
After an&s;wering my harmle&s;s Similes, &s;he proceeds
to a matter which does not regard &s;o much the ho|nour
of <HI>Homer,</HI> as that of the times he liv'd in;
and here I mu&s;t confe&s;s &s;he does not wholly mi&s;take
my meaning, but I think &s;he mi&s;takes the &s;tate
of the que&s;tion. She had &s;aid, the Manners of tho&s;e
times were &s;o much the better the le&s;s they were
like ours: I thought this required a little qualificati|on,
I confe&s;t that in my own opinion the world was
mended in &s;ome points, &s;uch as the cu&s;tom of put|ting
whole nations to the &s;word, condemning Kings
and their families to perpetual &s;lavery, and a few
others. Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> judges otherwi&s;e in this; but
as to the re&s;t, particularly in preferring the &s;implicity
of the ancient world to the luxury of ours, which is
the main point contended for, &s;he owns we agree. This
I thought was well, but I am &s;o unfortunate that this
too is taken ami&s;s, and call'd adopting or (if you will)
&s;tealing <HI>her</HI> &s;entiment. The truth is &s;he might have
&s;aid <HI>her words,</HI> for I u&s;ed them on purpo&s;e, being
then profe&s;&s;edly, citing from her: tho' I might have
done the &s;ame without intending that compliment,
for they are al&s;o to be found in <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> and the
&s;entiment I believe is that of all mankind. I cannot
really tell what to &s;ay to this whole Remark, only
that in the fir&s;t part of it Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> is di&s;|plea&s;ed
that I don't agree with her, and in the la&s;t
<PB N="313" REF="308">
that I do: But this is a temper which every po|lite
man &s;hould over-look in a Lady.</P>
<P>To puni&s;h my ingratitude, &s;he re&s;olves to expo&s;e
my blunders, and &s;elects two which I &s;uppo&s;e are
the mo&s;t flagrant, out of the many for which &s;he
could have cha&s;tiz'd me. It happens that the fir&s;t of
the&s;e is in part the Tran&s;lator's, and in part her own,
without any &s;hare of mine: She quotes the end of a
&s;entence, and he puts in <HI>French</HI> what I never wrote in
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> &startq;<HI>Homer</HI> (I &s;aid) open'd a new and bound|le&s;s
walk for his imagination, and created a world
for him&s;elf in the invention of Fable;&endq; which he
tran&s;lates, <HI>Homere crea pour &s;on u&s;age un monde
mouvant, en inventant la fable.</HI></P>
<P>Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> ju&s;tly wonders at this non&s;en&s;e
in me; and I, in the Tran&s;lator. As to what I
meant by <HI>Homer's</HI> invention of Fable, it is after|wards
particularly di&s;tingui&s;h'd from that exten&s;ive
&s;en&s;e in which &s;he took it, by the&s;e words. &startq;If
<HI>Homer</HI> was not the fir&s;t, who introduced the Dei|ties
(as <HI>Herodotus</HI> imagines) into the religion of
<HI>Greece,</HI> he &s;eems the fir&s;t who brought them into
<HI>a Sy&s;tem of Machinery</HI> for Poetry.</P>
<P>The other blunder &s;he accu&s;es me of is, the
mi&s;taking a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and &s;he is plea&s;ed
to &s;end me back to this Philo&s;opher's treati&s;e of Po|etry,
and to her Preface on the Ody&s;&s;ey for my
<PB N="314" REF="309">
better in&s;truction. Now tho' I am &s;awcy enough
to think that one may &s;ometimes differ from <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI>
without blundering, and tho' I am &s;ure one
may &s;ometimes fall into an error by following him &s;er|vilely;
yet I own that to quote any Author for what
he never &s;aid is a blunder; (but by the way, to cor|rect
an Author for what he never &s;aid, is &s;omewhat
wor&s;e than a blunder.) My words were the&s;e. &startq;As
there is a greater variety of Characters in the Iliad
than in any other Poem, &s;o there is of Speeches.
Every thing in it has manners, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> expre&s;&s;es
it; That is, every thing is acted or &s;poken: very
little pa&s;&s;es in narration.&endq; She ju&s;tly &s;ays that &startq;E|very
thing which is acted or &s;poken, has not nece&s;&s;a|rily
manners merely becau&s;e it is acted or &s;poken.&endq;
Agreed: But I would ask the que&s;tion, whether any
thing can have manners which is neither acted nor
&s;poken? if not, then the whole Iliad being almo&s;t
&s;pent in &s;peech and action, almo&s;t every thing in
it has Manners: &s;ince <HI>Homer</HI> has been prov'd be|fore
in a long paragraph of the Preface, to have ex|cell'd
in drawing Characters and painting Manners,
and indeed his whole Poem is one continued occa|&s;ion
of &s;hewing this bright part of his talent.</P>
<P>To &s;peak fairly, it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could read
even the tran&s;lation, and take my &s;en&s;e &s;o wrong
as &s;he repre&s;ents it; but I was fir&s;t tran&s;lated igno|rantly,
<PB N="315" REF="310">
and then read partially. My expre&s;&s;ion in|deed
was not quite exact; it &s;hould have been,
&startq;Every thing has manners as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> calls them.&endq;
But &s;uch a fault methinks might have been &s;pa|red,
&s;ince if one was to look with that di&s;po&s;iti|on

&s;ome &s;lips of this &s;ort have afforded, to <HI>Homer</HI>'s, hers
and my enemies, from which &s;he was only &s;creen'd

when &s;he in&s;ulted Mr. <HI>de la Motte</HI> for omitting a

<P>Our concern, zeal, and even jealou&s;y, for our great
Author's honour were mutual, our endeavours to ad|vance
it were equal, and I have as often trembled for it
in her hands, as &s;he could in mine. It was one of the
many rea&s;ons I had to wi&s;h the longer life of this La|dy,
that I mu&s;t certainly have regain'd her good
opinion, in &s;pite of all mi&s;-repre&s;enting Tran&s;lators
whatever. I could not have expected it on any other
<PB N="316" REF="311">
terms than being approved as great, if not as pa&s;&s;io|nate,
an admirer of <HI>Homer</HI> as her &s;elf. For that was
the fir&s;t condition of her favour and friend&s;hip; o|therwi&s;e
not one's Ta&s;te alone, but one's Morality
had been corrupted, nor would any man's Religion
have been un&s;u&s;pected, who did not implicitly be|lieve
in an Author who&s;e doctrine is &s;o conformable
to holy Scripture. However, as different people have
different ways of expre&s;&s;ing their Belief, &s;ome purely
by public and general acts of wor&s;hip, others by a
reverend &s;ort of rea&s;oning and enquiry about the
grounds of it; 'tis the &s;ame in Admiration, &s;ome
prove it by exclamations, others by re&s;pect. I have
ob&s;erved that the loude&s;t huzza's given to a great
man in a triumph, proceed not from his friends, but
the rabble; and as I have fancy'd it the &s;ame with
the rabble of Criticks, a de&s;ire to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd
from them has turn'd me to the more moderate, and
I hope, more rational method. Tho' I am a Poet,
I would not be an Enthu&s;ia&s;t; and tho' I am an
Engli&s;hman, I would not be furiou&s;ly of a Party. I
am far from thinking my &s;elf that Genius, upon
whom at the end of the&s;e remarks Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>
congratulates my country: One capable of &startq;correct|ing
<HI>Homer,</HI> and con&s;equently of reforming man|kind,
and amending this Con&s;titution.&endq; It was
not to <HI>Great Britain</HI> this ought to have been ap|ply'd,
<PB N="317" REF="312">
&s;ince our nation has one happine&s;s for
which &s;he might have preferr'd it to her own,
that as much as we abound in other mi&s;erable mi&s;|guided
Sects, we have at lea&s;t none of the bla&s;|phemers
of <HI>Homer.</HI> We &s;tedfa&s;tly and unanimou&s;ly
believe, both his Poem, and our Con&s;titution, to be
the be&s;t that ever human wit invented: That the one
is not more incapable of amendment than the other;
and (old as they both are) we de&s;pi&s;e any <HI>French</HI> or
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man whatever, who &s;hall pre&s;ume to retrench,
to innovate, or to make the lea&s;t alteration in either.
Far therefore from the Genius for which Madam <HI>Da|cier</HI>
mi&s;took me, my whole de&s;ire is but to pre&s;erve
the humble character of a faithful Tran&s;lator, and a
quiet Subject.</P>
