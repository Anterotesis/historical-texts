<HEAD>PROLOGUE, Spoken by Mr. FOOTE, At the Theatre-Royal in DUBLIN, On the 19th of November, 1773.</HEAD>
<L>UPWARDS of twenty years are &s;led and wa&s;ted</L>
<L>Since in this &s;pot your favour fir&s;t I ta&s;ted.</L>
<L>Urg'd by your &s;miles thro' various realms to roam,</L>
<L>The Mu&s;e now brings her motley cargo home;</L>
<L>For frugal Nature, with an equal hand,</L>
<L>Be&s;tows peculiar gifts to every land.</L>
<L>To France &s;he gave her rapid repartee,</L>
<L>Bows, and <HI>bons mots,</HI> fibs, fa&s;hions, flattery,</L>
<L>Shrugs, grins, grimace, and &s;portive gaiety:</L>
<L>Arm'd with the whole artillery of love,</L>
<L>Latium's &s;oft &s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;s the powers to move:</L>
<L>Humour, the foremo&s;t of the fe&s;tive crew,</L>
<L>Source of the comic &s;cene, &s;he gave to you;</L>
<L>Humour, with arched brow, and leering eye,</L>
<L>Shrewd, &s;olemn, &s;neering, &s;ubtle, &s;low and &s;ly;</L>
<L>Serious her&s;elf, yet laughter &s;till provoking,</L>
<L>By tea&s;ing, tickling, jeering, gibing, joking:</L>
<L>Impartial gift, that owns nor rank nor birth!</L>
<L>'Tis theirs who rule the realm, or till the earth;</L>
<L>Theirs who in &s;enates wage the wordy war,</L>
<L>And theirs who&s;e humble lot conducts the car:</L>
<L>If aught deriv'd from her adorns my &s;train,</L>
<L>You gave, at lea&s;t di&s;cover'd fir&s;t, the vein.</L>
<L>Should wide experience, or maturing age,</L>
<L>Have brought or mirth or moral to the &s;tage,</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="4">To you, the patrons of the wilder &s;ong,</L>
<L>The cha&s;ter notes in ju&s;tice mu&s;t belong:</L>
<L>But &s;hould infirmities with time con&s;pire,</L>
<L>My force to weaken or abate my fire,</L>
<L>Le&s;s entertainment may ari&s;e to you,</L>
<L>But to my&s;elf le&s;s danger will en&s;ue.</L>
<L>If age contracts my mu&s;cles, &s;hrills my tone,</L>
<L>No man will claim tho&s;e foibles as his own;</L>
<L>Nor, if I halt or hobble thro' the &s;cene,</L>
<L>Malice point out what citizen I mean:</L>
<L>No foe I fear more than a legal fury,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s I gain this circle for my jury.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Oldham.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>NOT a &s;yllable more will I hear!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but, my dear&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am amazed, Sir John, at your meanne&s;s! or that you could &s;ubmit to give his paltry propo&s;als &s;o much as a reading!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear, what would you have had me done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Done? returned them with the con|tempt they de&s;erved. But, come, unfold! I am calm: Reveal the pretty project your precious head has produced.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear, as to that, my head produced&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I don't wonder that &s;hame has tied up your tongue! But, come; I will &s;pare the confu&s;ion, and tell you what you would &s;ay. Here, Lady Oldham, Sir Matthew Mite has ju&s;t &s;ent me a letter, mode&s;tly de&s;iring that, in return for the ruin he has brought on me and my hou&s;e, I would be &s;o kind as to be&s;tow upon him my darling daughter, the hopes of my&mdash; And is it po&s;&s;ible you can be mean enough to think of &s;uch an alliance? Will you, Sir John, oblige me with an an&s;wer to a few &s;hort que&s;tions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you con&s;ider your&s;elf as &s;prung from a family at lea&s;t as ancient as any in the county you live in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That I fancy will not be denied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor was it, I fancy, di&s;honoured by an alliance with mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My Lady, the very rever&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;ucceeded, Sir, to a patrimony, which though the liberal and ho&s;pitable &s;pirit of your predece&s;&s;ors would not &s;uffer to encrea&s;e, yet their prudence took care &s;hould never be dimini&s;hed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>From the public and private virtues of
<PB N="3" REF="8">
your ance&s;tors, the inhabitants of the neighbour|ing borough thought their be&s;t and deare&s;t in|tere&s;ts in no hands &s;o &s;ecure as in theirs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nor till lately were they &s;o tainted by the fa&s;hion of the times, as to adopt the egregious ab&s;urdity, That to be faithfully &s;erved and pro|tected above, it was nece&s;&s;ary to be largely bribed and corrupted below?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I can't &s;ay, except now and then a bit of veni&s;on, or an annual dinner, they have ever put me to any great&mdash;&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indulge me yet a moment, Sir John! In this happy &s;ituation, did the la&s;t year chear|fully clo&s;e; our condition, though not opulent, affluent, and you happy in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your family honours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is no gain&s;aying of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now, look at the di&s;mal, &s;hocking rever&s;e!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is but too much rea&s;on in what your lady&s;hip &s;ays.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And con&s;ider, at the &s;ame time, to whom you are obliged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what could we do? your lady&s;hip knows there was nobody more again&s;t my giving up than your&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let me proceed. At this cri&s;is,
<PB N="4" REF="9">
preceded by all the pomp of A&s;ia, Sir Matthew Mite, from the Indies, came thundering among&s;t us; and, profu&s;ely &s;cattering the &s;poils of ruined provinces, corrupted the virtue and alienated the affections of all the old friends to the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That is nothing but truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Compelled by the &s;ame means to defend tho&s;e that were employed in attacking your intere&s;t, you have been obliged deeply to encumber your fortune; his &s;uperior addre&s;s has procured a return, and probably your petition will complete the ruin his oppo&s;ition began.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hope all for the be&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And who can tell, but you may be &s;oon forced to part with your patrimony, to the very in&s;olent worthle&s;s individual, who has been the author of your di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I would &s;ooner peri&s;h, my Lady!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Parallel in&s;tances may be produced; nor is it at all unlikely, but Sir Matthew, taking a liking to your family man&s;ion, has pur&s;ued this very method to compel you to &s;ell it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is, my dear, to avoid this nece&s;&s;ity that I wi&s;h you to give his letter a reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, not to mention the mean|ne&s;s, that you can be weak enough to expect any real &s;ervice from that infamous quarter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10">
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who can tell, my love, but a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the mi&s;chief he has done us, may have rou&s;ed &s;ome feelings that&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>His feelings! will he li&s;ten to a pri|vate complaint, who has been deaf to the cries of a people? or drop a tear for particular di&s;|tre&s;s, who owes his ri&s;e to the ruin of thou&s;ands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Lady Oldham, I find all that I &s;ay &s;ignifies nothing. &mdash;But here comes brother Thomas; two heads are better than one; let us take his opinion, my love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What need of any opinion? the ca&s;e is too clear; nor indeed, if there had been a nece&s;&s;ity for con&s;ulting another, &s;hould I have thought your brother the propere&s;t man to ad|vi&s;e with on the occa&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And why not? there is not a mer|chant who&s;e judgment would be &s;ooner taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not, on the value of mer|chandize, or the goodne&s;s of a Bill of Exchange: But there is a nicety, a delicacy, an elevation of &s;entiment, in this ca&s;e, which people who have narrowed their notions with commerce, and con|&s;idered during the cour&s;e of their lives their in|tere&s;t alone, will &s;carce comprehend.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Mr. Thomas Oldham.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, &s;i&s;ter! what! upon your old topic, I find?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="11">
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Some pretty compari&s;ons, I &s;uppo&s;e, not much to the honour of trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, brother, you know I have always allowed merchants to be a u&s;eful body of men; and con&s;idered commerce, in this country, as a pretty re&s;ource enough for the younger &s;hoots of a family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Exceedingly conde&s;cending, indeed! And yet, &s;i&s;ter, I could produce you &s;ome in|&s;tances where the younger &s;hoots have flou|ri&s;hed and throve, when the reverend trunk has decayed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, brother Thomas&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, don't let us revive our antient di&s;putes!&mdash;You &s;eem warm; no mi&s;un|der&s;tanding, I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; none, in the lea&s;t: You know, my lady's temper's apt to be lively now and then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, &s;i&s;ter&mdash;But, come! what ha$ occa&s;ioned this mighty debate?</P>

<P>Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That in your hand?</P>

<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To what end?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A very natural one; in order to know the contents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Of what importance can they be to us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That the letter will tell you. But &s;urely, Lady Oldham, you are rather too nice. Give it me!</P>

<P>Is it your lady&s;hip's plea&s;ure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>P&s;ha! here's a rout, indeed!&mdash;One would be apt to &s;u&s;pect that the packet was pe&s;tilential, and came from the Archipelago, in&s;tead of the Indies. Now let us &s;ee what this formidable memorial contains! <STAGE><HI>opens the letter.</HI></STAGE> <Q>&startq;To Sir John Oldham.

<P>But do they always prevail?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is now, brother Thomas, no danger to dread; the re&s;traint the popular part of government has in this in&s;tance laid on it&s;elf, at the &s;ame time that it does honour to them, di&s;tributes equal ju&s;tice to all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And are you aware what the expence will be to obtain it?&mdash;But, pray, let me pro|ceed!&mdash;<Q>&startq;Secondly, as Sir Matthew is bent upon a large territorial acqui&s;ition in England, and Sir John Oldham's finances are at pre&s;ent a lit|tle out of repair, Sir Matthew Mite will make up the money already advanced in another name, by way of future mortgage upon his e&s;tate, for the entire purcha&s;e, five lacks of &endq;roupees.</Q></P>

<P>Sixty thou&s;and, at lea&s;t.</P>

<P>A jagghire?</P>

<P>The term is Indian, and means an annual income.</P>

<P>What &s;trange jargon he deals in!</P>

<P>But two articles more, <STAGE><HI>reads</HI></STAGE> <Q>&startq;And that the principals may have no cares for the younger parts of their family, Sir Matthew will, at his own expence, tran&s;port the two young ladies, Mi&s;s Oldham's two &s;i&s;ters, to Madra&s;s or Calcutta, and there procure them &endq;&s;uitable hu&s;bands.</Q></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he treats my children like a parcel of convicts: Is this their method of &s;up|plying their &s;ettlements?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="15">
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This, with now and then a little kid|napping, dear &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;Well, madam, you have now the means of getting rid of all your offspring at once: Did not I tell you the paper was worth your peru&s;al? You will reply to his wi&s;h; you can have no doubts, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not the lea&s;t, as I will &s;hew you. <STAGE><HI>Tears the letter.</HI></STAGE> And, if Sir John has the lea&s;t &s;pirit or pride, he will treat the in&s;olent principal as I do his propo&s;als.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But that method, as things &s;tand, may not be altogether &s;o &s;afe. I am &s;orry you were &s;o ha&s;ty in de&s;troying the letter: If I remember rightly, there is mention made of advancing money in another man's name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We have been compelled to borrow, I own; but I had no conception that he was the lender.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's done by a common contrivance; not a country lawyer but knows the doctrine of transfer.&mdash;How much was the &s;um?</P>

<P>Gentlemen! Not contented with col|lecting, for the u&s;e of my country, the&s;e ine&s;ti|mable relics, with a large catalogue of petri|factions, bones, beetles, and butterflies, con|tained in that box, <STAGE><HI>pointing to the pre&s;ent borne by the fourth Black.</HI></STAGE> I have likewi&s;e laboured for the advancement of national knowledge: For which end, permit me to clear up &s;ome doubts relative to a material and intere&s;ting point in the
<PB N="55" REF="60">
Engli&s;h hi&s;tory. Let others toil to illumine the dark annals of Greece, or of Rome; my &s;earches are &s;acred only to the &s;ervice of Britain!</P>
<P>The point I mean to clear up, is an error crept into the life of that illu&s;trious magi&s;trate, the great Whittington, and his no-le&s;s-eminent Cat: And in this di&s;qui&s;ition four material points are in que&s;tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did Whittington ever exi&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was Whittington Lord-Mayor of Lon|don?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was he really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Cat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>4th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was that Cat the &s;ource of his wealth?</P>
<P>That Whittington lived, no doubt can be made; that he was Lord-Mayor of London, is equally true; but as to his Car, that, gentle|men, is the gordian knot to untie. And here, gentlemen, be it permitted me to define what a Cat is. A Cat is a dome&s;tic, whi&s;kered, four-footed animal, who&s;e employment is catching of mice; but let Pu&s;s have been ever &s;o &s;ubtle, let Pu&s;s have been ever &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, to what could Pu&s;s's captures amount? no tanner can curry the &s;kin of a mou&s;e, no family make a of the meat; con&s;ecquently, no Cat could give Whittington his wealth. From whence then does this error proceed? be that my care $word$ point out!</P>
<P>The commerce this worthy merchant carried
<PB N="56" REF="61">
on, was chiefly confined to our coa&s;ts; fo$ this purpo&s;e, he con&s;tructed a ve&s;&s;el, which, from its agility and lightne&s;s, he aptly chri&s;tened a Cat. Nay, to this our day, gentlemen, all our coals from Newca&s;tle are imported in nothing but Cats. From thence it appears, that it was not the whi&s;kered, four-footed, mou&s;e-killing Cat that was the &s;ource of the magi&s;trate's wealth but the coa&s;ting, &s;ailing, coal-carrying Cat; that gentlemen, was Whittington's Cat.</P>

<P>But why make it a my&s;tery? have you no gue&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not the mo&s;t di&s;tant conception. My lady's di&s;like would hardly prompt her to &s;uch violent mea&s;ures. I can't comprehend how this can po&s;&s;ibly be; but yet my father has too firm, too manly a mind, to encourage or harbour vain fears.</P>

<P>Perhaps he depends on his rhetorical powers: I hear he has a good opinion of them. Stay, Sophy! Sir Matthew Mite, di&s;tru&s;ting the me&s;&s;age we begged your uncle to carry, de|&s;ires to have it confirmed by our&s;elves: I fancy, child, you will do your&s;elf no violence in re|jecting this lover.

<P>Well, in the main, I am glad of this meeting; it will not only put a final end to this bu&s;ine&s;s, but give us an opportunity of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing other matters, my dear.</P>

<P>I find the whole tribe is convened.&mdash;I hope I am not an intruder; but I confe&s;s the extraordinary an&s;wer I received from the mouth of this worthy citizen, to a me&s;&s;age conveyed by my &s;ecretary, induced me to que&s;tion its au|thenticity, unle&s;s confirmed by your&s;elves.</P>

<P>Which this conduct of mine inclines you to doubt?</P>

<P>Let us have them, however.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You will, Sir Matthew, pardon my weakne&s;s; but I would much rather &s;ee my child with a competence, nay, even reduced to an in|digent &s;tate, than voluptuou&s;ly rioting in plea|&s;ures that derive their &s;ource from the ruin of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ruin! what, you, I find, adopt the po|pular prejudice, and conclude that every man that is rich is a villain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>L. Old.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I only echo the voice of the public. Be&s;ides, I would wi&s;h my daughter a more &s;olid e&s;tabli&s;hment: The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions ari&s;ing from plun|der very rarely are permanent; we every day &s;ee what has been treacherou&s;ly and rapaciou&s;ly gained, as profu&s;ely and full as rapidly &s;quandered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="66" REF="71">
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry, madam, to &s;ee one of your fa&s;hion, concur in the common cry of the times; but &s;uch is the gratitude of this country to tho&s;e who have given it dominion and wealth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Thomas.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I could wi&s;h even that fact was well founded, Sir Matthew. Your riches (which per|haps too are only ideal) by introducing a general &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ipation, have extingui&s;hed labour and indu&s;try, the &s;low, but &s;ure &s;ource of national wealth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To the&s;e refinements I have no time to reply. By one of your lady&s;hip's hints I &s;hall profit at lea&s;t: I &s;hall be a little more careful of the plunder I have made. Sir John Oldham, you recollect a &s;mall &s;um borrowed by you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do.</P>

<P>I under&s;tand as much by your letter.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As I find there is an end of our treaty, it would be right, I think, to di&s;charge them directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay that is quite &s;o convenient; be&s;ides, I under&s;tood the party was to wait till the time that Jack comes of age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mite.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am told the law does not under&s;tand what is not clearly expre&s;&s;ed. Be&s;ides, the probable event of your death, or the young gentleman's

<SP>

<P>You mu&s;t, Ma&s;ter Oldham, give me leave to laugh at your prophetic effu&s;ion.

<P>I am doubly paid, Lady Oldham, in &s;upplying the wants of my friends, and defeating the de&s;igns of a villain: As to the mere money, we citizens indeed are odd kind of folks, and always expect good &s;ecurity for what we advance.</P>
