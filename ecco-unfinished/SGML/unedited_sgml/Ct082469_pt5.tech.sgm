<P>IN a nation divided like the Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXIX.</NOTE> it could &s;carce
be expected, that the death of one &s;overeign, and
the acce&s;&s;ion of another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1558.</NOTE> who was &s;trongly &s;u&s;|pected
to have embraced oppo&s;ite principles to tho&s;e
which prevailed, could be the object of univer&s;al &s;atis|faction:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's po|pularity.</NOTE> Yet &s;o much were Men di&s;plea&s;ed with the
pre&s;ent conduct of affairs, and &s;uch apprehen&s;ions were
<PB N="2" REF="7">
entertained of futurity, that the people, overlooking
their theological di&s;putes, expre&s;&s;ed a very general and
unfeigned joy that the &s;cepter had pa&s;&s;ed into the hands
of Elizabeth. That prince&s;s had di&s;covered great pru|dence
in her conduct during the reign of her &s;i&s;ter; and
as men were &s;en&s;ible of the imminent danger to which
&s;he was every moment expo&s;ed, the compa&s;&s;ion towards
her &s;ituation, and concern for her &s;afety, had rendered
her, to an uncommon degree, the favourite of the na|tion.
A Parliament had been a&s;&s;embled a few days be|fore
Mary's death; and when Heathe, archbi&s;hop of
York, then chancellor, notified to them that event,
&s;carce an interval of regret appeared; and the two
hou&s;es immediately re&s;ounded with the joyful accla|mations
of &startq;God &s;ave Queen Elizabeth: Long and
happily may &s;he reign.&endq; The people, le&s;s actuated
by faction, and le&s;s influenced by private views, expre&s;|&s;ed
a joy &s;till more general and hearty or her procla|mation;
and the au&s;picious commencement of this reign
progno&s;ticated that felicity and glory which, during its
whole cour&s;e, &s;o uniformly attended it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 373.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was at Hatfield when &s;he heard of her
&s;i&s;ter's death; and after a few days &s;he proceeded thence
to London, thro' crowds of People, who &s;trove with
each other in giving her the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony of their
affections. On her entrance into the Tower, &s;he
could not forbear reflecting on the great difference be|tween
her pre&s;ent fortune and that which a few years
before had attended her, when &s;he was conducted to
that place as a pri&s;oner, and lay there expo&s;ed to all
the bigotted malignity of her enemies. She fell on her
knees, and expre&s;&s;ed her thanks to heaven, for the de|liverance
which the Almighty had granted her from her
bloody per&s;ecutors; a deliverance, &s;he &s;aid, no le&s;s mi|raculous
than that which Daniel had received from the
<PB N="3" REF="8">
den of lions. This act of pious gratitude &s;eems to
have been the la&s;t circum&s;tance in which &s;he remem|bered
any pa&s;t injuries and hard&s;hips. With a pru|dence
and magnanimity truly laudable, &s;he buried all
offences in oblivion, and received with affability even
tho&s;e who had acted with the greate&s;t virulence again&s;t
her. Sir Harry Bennifield him&s;elf, to who&s;e cu&s;tody
&s;he had been committed, and who had treated her with
uncommon &s;everity, never felt, during the whole cour&s;e
of her reign, any effects of her re&s;entment<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burne$, vol. II. p. $74.</NOTE>. Yet was
not the gracious reception which &s;he gave, pro&s;titute
and undi&s;tingui&s;hing. When the bi&s;hops came in a
body to make their obei&s;ance to her, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed to
all of them &s;entiments of regard; except to Bonner,
from whom &s;he turned a&s;ide, as from a Man polluted
with blood, who was a ju&s;t object of horror to every
heart &s;u&s;ceptible of humanity.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Heylin, p. 102.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER employing a few days in ordering her do|me&s;tic
affairs, Elizabeth notified to foreign courts, her
&s;i&s;ter's death, and her own acce&s;&s;ion to the crown. She
&s;ent lord Cobham to the low Countries, where Philip
then re&s;ided; and &s;he took care to expre&s;s to that mo|narch,
her gratitude for the protection which he had af|forded
her, and her de&s;ire of per&s;evering in that friend|&s;hip
which was &s;o happily commenced between them.
Philip, who had long fore&s;een this event, and who &s;till
hoped, by means of Elizabeth, to obtain that dominion
over England, which he had failed of in e&s;pou&s;ing Ma|ry,
immediately di&s;patched orders to the duke of Feria,
his amba&s;&s;ador at London, to make propo&s;als of mar|riage
to the Queen, and $e offered to procure from
Rome a di&s;pen&s;ation for that purpo&s;e. But Elizabeth
&s;oon came to the re&s;olution of declining this propo|&s;al.
She &s;aw that the nation had entertained an ex|treme
aver&s;ion to the Spani&s;h alliance during her &s;i&s;|ter's
<PB N="4" REF="9">
reign; and that one great cau&s;e of the popularity
which &s;he her&s;elf enjoyed, was the pro&s;pect of being
freed, by her means, from the danger of foreign &s;ub|jection.
She was &s;en&s;ible that her affinity with Phi|lip
was exactly &s;imilar to that between her father and
Catharine of Arragon; and that her marrying that mo|narch
was, in effect, declaring her&s;elf illegitimate, and
incapable of &s;ucceeding to the throne. And tho' the
power of the Spani&s;h monarchy might &s;till be &s;ufficient,
in oppo&s;ition to all pretenders, to &s;upport her title, her
ma&s;culine &s;pirit di&s;dained &s;uch precarious dominion,
which, as it would depend &s;olely on the power of ano|ther,
mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed according to his inclination<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden in Kennet, p. 370. Burnet, vol. II. p. 375.</NOTE>.
But while the&s;e views prevented her from entertaining
any thoughts of a marriage with Philip, &s;he gave him
a very obliging, tho' eva&s;ive, an&s;wer; and he &s;till re|tained
&s;uch hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, that he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger
to Rome, with orders to &s;ollicit the di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>THE Queen too, on her &s;i&s;ter's death, had wrote to
Sir Edward Carne, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Rome,
to &s;ignify her acce&s;&s;ion to the pope; but the precipitate
nature of Paul broke thro' all the cautious mea&s;ures con|certed
by that young prince&s;s. He told Carne, that
England was a $ief of the holy &s;ee; and it was a great
temerity in her to have a&s;&s;umed, without his partici|pation,
the title and authority of Queen: That Eliza|beth,
being illegitimate, could not po&s;&s;ibly inherit that
kingdom; nor could he annul the &s;entence pronounced
by Clement the &s;eventh, and Paul the third, with regard
to Henry's marriage: That were he to proceed with ri|gour,
he would puni&s;h this criminal inva&s;ion of his
rights, by rejecting all her applications; but being wil|ling
to treat her with paternal indulgence, he would
&s;till keep the door of grace open to her: And that if &s;he
would renounce all preten&s;ions to the throne, and &s;ub|mit
<PB N="5" REF="10">
entirely to his will, &s;he &s;hould experience the ut|mo&s;t
lenity which was compatible with the dignity of
the apo&s;tolic &s;ee<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. v.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1585.</NOTE> When this an&s;wer was reported
to Elizabeth, &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed at the character of
that aged pontiff; and having recalled her amba&s;&s;ador,
&s;he continued with more determined re&s;olution to pur|&s;ue
tho&s;e mea&s;ures which &s;he had already &s;ecretly em|braced.</P>
<P>THE Queen, not to alarm the partizans of the catho|lic
religion, had retained eleven of her &s;i&s;ter's coun|cellors;
but in order to ballance their authority, &s;he
added eight more who were known to be affectionate to
the prote&s;tant communion: The marquis of Nor|thampton,
the earl of Bedford, Sir Thomas Parry, Sir
Edward Rogers, Sir Ambro&s;e Cave, Sir Francis Knolles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re-e&s;tab|li&s;hment of the pro|te&s;tant re|ligion.</NOTE>
Sir Nicholas Bacon, whom &s;he created lord keeper, and
Sir William Cecil, &s;ecretary of &s;tate<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype's Ann. vol. I. p. 5.</NOTE>. With the&s;e
councellors, particularly Cecil, &s;he frequently deliberated
concerning the expediency of re&s;toring the prote&s;tant
religion, and the means of executing that great enter|pri&s;e.
Cecil told her, that the greate&s;t part of the na|tion
had, ever &s;ince her father's reign, inclined to the
reformation; and tho' her &s;i&s;ter had con&s;trained them
to profe&s;s the ancient faith, the cruelties exerci&s;ed by her
mini&s;ters had &s;till more alienated their affections from
it: That happily the intere&s;ts of the &s;overeign concur|red
here with the inclinations of the people; nor was
her title to the crown compatible with the authority of
the Roman pontiff: That a &s;entence, &s;o &s;olemnly pro|nounced
by two popes again&s;t her mother's marriage,
could not po&s;&s;ibly be recalled, without inflicting a mor|tal
wound on the credit of the &s;ee of Rome; and even if
&s;he was allowed to retain the crown, it would only be
on an uncertain and dependant footing: That this mo|tive
counterballanced all dangers whatever; and the&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="11">
dangers them&s;elves, if narrowly viewed, would be
found very little formidable: That the cur&s;es and exe|crations
of the Romi&s;h church, when not &s;econded by
military force, were, in the pre&s;ent age, more an object
or ridicule than of terror, and had now as little influ|ence
in this world as in the next: That tho' the bigo|try
or ambition of Henry or Philip might incline them
to execute a &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t her,
their intere&s;ts were &s;o incompatible, that they never
could concur in any plan of operations; and the enmity
of the one would always en&s;ure to her the friend&s;hip of
the other: That if they encouraged the di&s;contents of
her catholic &s;ubjects, their dominions al&s;o abounded
with prote&s;tants, and it would be ea&s;y to retaliate that
injury upon them: That even &s;uch of the Engli&s;h as
&s;eemed at pre&s;ent zealou&s;ly attached to the catholic
faith, would mo&s;t of them embrace the religion of their
new &s;overeign; and the nation had of late been &s;o accu|&s;tomed
to the&s;e revolutions, that men had lo&s;t all idea
of truth and fal&s;ehood in &s;uch &s;ubjects: That the autho|rity
of Henry the eighth, &s;o highly rai&s;ed by many con|curring
circum&s;tances, fir&s;t enured the people to this
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference; and it was the le&s;s difficult for
the &s;ucceeding princes to continue the nation in a train
to which it had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed: And that it
would be ea&s;y for her, by be&s;towing on prote&s;tants all
the commi&s;&s;ions in civil offices and the militia, the
church and the univer&s;ities, both to en&s;ure her own au|thority,
and to render her religion entirely predomi|nant<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 377. Camden, p. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE education of Elizabeth, as well as her intere&s;t,
led her to favour the reformation; and &s;he remained not
long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e with regard to the party, which &s;he
&s;hould embrace: But, tho' determined in her own mind,
&s;he re&s;olved to proceed by gradual and &s;ecure &s;teps,
<PB N="7" REF="12">
and not to imitate the example of Mary, in encoura|ging
the bigots of her party to make immediately a vio|lent
inva&s;ion on the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 378. Camden, p. 371.</NOTE>. She thought
it requi&s;ite, however, to di&s;cover &s;uch &s;ymptons of her
intentions, as might give encouragement to the prote&s;|$ants,
&s;o much depre&s;&s;ed by the late violent pre&s;ecution.
She immediately recalled all the exiles, and gave liberty
to the pri&s;oners who were confined on account of reli|gion.
We are told of a plea&s;antry of one Rainsford on
this occa&s;ion, who &s;aid to the Queen, that he had a peti|tion
to pre&s;ent her in behalf of other pri&s;oners called
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John: She readily replied,
that it behoved her fir&s;t to con&s;ult the pri&s;oners them|&s;elves,
and to learn of them whether they de&s;ired that
liberty, which he demanded for them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 103.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH al&s;o proceeded to exert, in favour of the
reformers, &s;ome acts of power, which were con&s;i&s;tent
with the extent of the royal prerogative, during that age.
Finding, that the prote&s;tant teachers, irritated by per&s;e|cution,
broke out in a furious accack on the antient &s;u|per&s;tition,
and that the Romani&s;ts replied with no le&s;s
zeal and acrimony, &s;he publi&s;hed a proclamation, by
which &s;he inhibited all preaching without a &s;pecial li|cence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 104. Strype, vol. I. p. 41.</NOTE>; and tho' &s;he di&s;pen&s;ed with the&s;e orders in fa|vour
of &s;ome preachers of her own &s;ect, &s;he took care,
that they &s;hould be the mo&s;t calm and moderate of the
party. She al&s;o &s;u&s;pended the laws &s;o far as to order a
great part of the &s;ervice; the litany, the Lord's prayer,
the creed, and the go&s;pels; to be read in Engli&s;h. And
having fir&s;t publi&s;hed injunctions, that all the churches
&s;hould conform them&s;elves to the practice of her own
chapel, &s;he forbad the ho&s;te to be any more elevated in
her pre&s;ence; an innovation, which, however frivo|lous
<PB N="8" REF="13">
it may appear, implied the mo&s;t material con&s;e|quences<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 371. Heylin, p. 104. Strype, vol. I. p. 54. Stowe&punc; p. $35.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE declarations of her intention, concurring
with the preceding &s;u&s;picions, made the bi&s;hops fore|&s;ee
with certainty a revolution in religion. They
therefore refu&s;ed to officiate at her coronation; and it
was with &s;ome difficulty, that the bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le was
at la&s;t prevailed on to perform that ceremony. When &s;he
was conducted thro' London, amid&s;t the joyful accla|mations
of her &s;ubjects, a boy, who per&s;onated Truth,
was let down from one of the triumphal arches, and
pre&s;ented her with a copy of the Bible. She received
the book with the mo&s;t gracious deportment, placed it
next her bo&s;om, and declared, that, admi&s;t all the co&s;t|ly
te&s;timonies which the city had that day given her of
their attachment, this pre&s;ent was by far the mo&s;t pre|cious
and mo&s;t acceptable<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 380. Strype, vol. I. p. 29.</NOTE>. Such were the innocent
artifices, by which Elizabeth in&s;inuated her&s;elf into
the affections of her &s;ubjects. Open in her addre&s;s,
gracious and affable in all public appearances, &s;he re|joiced
in the concour&s;e of her Subjects, entered into all
their plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements, and without departing
from her dignity, which &s;he knew well how to pre&s;erve,
&s;he acquired a popularity beyond what any of he$ pre|dece&s;&s;ors
or &s;ucce&s;&s;ors ever could attain. Her own &s;ex
exulted to &s;ee a woman hold the reins of empire with
&s;uch prudence and fortitude: And while a young prin|ce&s;s
of twenty-five years (for that was her age at her
acce&s;&s;ion) who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the graces and in&s;inuation,
tho' not all the beauty of her &s;ex, courted the affections
of individuals by her civilities, of the public by her &s;er|vices,
her authority, tho' corroborated by the &s;tricte&s;t
bands of law and religion, appeared to be derived en|tirely
from the choice and inclination of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14">
A SOVEREIGN of this di&s;po&s;ition was not likely to
offend her &s;ubjects by any u&s;ele&s;s or violent exertions
of power;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1559.</NOTE> and Elizabeth, tho' &s;he threw out &s;uch hints
as encouraged the prote&s;tants, delayed the entire change
of religion till the meeting of the Parlia|ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE> which
was &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;emble. The elections had gone

to have made any great &s;truggle for the &s;uperiority;
and the Hou&s;es met in a di&s;po&s;ition of gratifying the
Queen in every particular, which &s;he could de&s;ire of
them. They began the &s;e&s;&s;ion with an unanimous de|claration,
&startq;that Queen Elizabeth was, and ought to
be, as well by the word of God, as the common and
&s;tatute laws of the realm, the lawful, undoubted, and
true heir to the crown, lawfully de&s;cended from the
blood-royal, according to the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
&s;ettled in the 35th of Henry VIII<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 3.</NOTE>.&endq; This act of
recognition was undoubtedly dictated by the Queen her|&s;elf
and her mini&s;ters; and &s;he &s;hewed her magnanimity,
as well as moderatio$ in the terms, which &s;he em|ployed
on that occa&s;ion. She followed not Mary's
practice in declaring the validity of her mother's mar|riage,
or in expre&s;ly repealing the act formerly made a|gain&s;t
her own legitimacy: She knew, that this attempt
mu&s;t be attended with reflexions on her father's me|mory,
and on the birth of her decea&s;ed &s;i&s;ter; and as all
the world were &s;en&s;ible that Henry's divorce from Anne
Boleyn was merely the effect of his violence and ca|price,
&s;he &s;corned to found her title on any act of an
a&s;&s;embly, which had too much pro&s;tituted its autho|rity
by its former variable, &s;ervile, and iniquitous de|ci&s;ions.
Satisfied therefore in the general opinion en|tertained
with regard to this fact, which appeared the
more undoubted, the le&s;s anxiety &s;he di&s;covered in for|tifying
it by votes and enquiries; &s;he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="10" REF="15">
of the throne, both as her birth-right, and as en&s;ured
to her by former acts of Parliament; and &s;he never ap|peared
&s;ollicitous to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e titles<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 372. Heylin, p. 107, 108.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t bill which was brought into the Parliament,
with a view of trying their di&s;po&s;ition with regard to
religion, was that for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the mona&s;teries lately
erected, and for re&s;toring the tenths and fir&s;t-fruits to
the Queen. This point being gained without much
difficulty, a bill was next introduced, annexing the
&s;upremacy to the crown; and tho' the Queen was
there denominated <HI>governe&s;s,</HI> not <HI>head,</HI> of the church,
it conveyed the &s;ame exten&s;ive power, which had for|merly
been exerci&s;ed by her father and brother. All
the bi&s;hops who were pre&s;ent in the upper hou&s;e &s;tre|nuou&s;ly
oppo&s;ed this law; and as they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more
learning than the temporal peers, they triumphed in
the argument; but the majority of voices in that
hou&s;e, as well as among the commons, were again&s;t
them. By this act the crown, without the concur|rence,
either of the Parliament or even of the convo|cation,
was ve&s;ted with the whole &s;piritual power;
might repre&s;s all here&s;ies<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">In determining here&s;y, the crown was only limited (if that could be called a limitation) to &s;uch doctrines as had been adjudged here&s;y, by the authority of the Scripture, by the fir&s;t four general councils, or by any ge|neral council, which followed the Scripture as their rule, or to &s;uch other doctrines as &s;hould hereafter be denominated here&s;y by the Parliament and convocation. 1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>, might e&s;tabli&s;h or repeal
all canons, might alter every point of di&s;cipline, and
might ordain or aboli&s;h any religious rite or ceremo|ny<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 1. This la&s;t power was anew granted in the act of uni|formity. 1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>. In order to exerci&s;e this unlimited authority,
the Queen, by a clau&s;e of the act, was empowered to
name commi&s;&s;ioners, either laymen or clergymen, as
&s;he &s;hould think proper; and on this clau&s;e was after|wards
<PB N="11" REF="16">
founded the court of eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion;
which a&s;&s;umed very large di&s;cretionary, not to &s;ay ar|bitrary
powers, totally incompatible with any exact
limitations in the con&s;titution. Their proceedings in|deed
were only con&s;i&s;tent with ab&s;olute monarchy;
but were entirely &s;uitable to the genius of the act on
which they were e&s;tabli&s;hed; an act that at once gave the
crown all the power, which had formerly been claim|ed
by the popes, but which even the&s;e u&s;urping pre|lates
had never been able fully to exerci&s;e, without
&s;ome concurrence of the clergy.</P>
<P>WHOEVER refu&s;ed to take an oath, acknowledging
the Queen's &s;upremacy, was incapacitated from holding
any office; whoever denied the &s;upremacy, or attempt|ed
to deprive the Queen of that prerogative, forfeited,
for the fir&s;t offence, all their goods and chattels; for
the &s;econd were &s;ubjected to the penalty of a premu|nire;
but the third offence was declared trea&s;on. The&s;e
puni&s;hments, however &s;evere, were le&s;s rigorous than
&s;uch as were formerly, during the reigns of her father
and brother, inflicted in like ca&s;es.</P>
<P>A LAW was pa&s;&s;ed, confirming all the &s;tatutes enact|ed
in King Edward's time with regard to religion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>:
The nomination of bi&s;hops was given to the crown
without any election of the chapters: The Queen was
empowered, on the vacancy of any &s;ee, to &s;eize all the
temporalities, and to be&s;tow on the bi&s;hops-elect an
equivalent, in the impropriations belonging to the
crown. This pretended equivalent was commonly ve|ry
much inferior in value; and thus the Queen, amid&s;t
all her concern for religion, followed the example of
the preceding reformers, in committing depredations on
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hops and all incumbents were prohibited
from alienating their revenues, and from letting lea&s;es
<PB N="12" REF="17">
longer than twenty-one years or three lives. This law
&s;eemed to be intended for &s;ecuring the property of the
church; but as an exception was left in favour of the
crown, great abu&s;es &s;till prevailed. It was u&s;ual for
a courtier, during this reign, to make an agreement
with a bi&s;hop or incumbent; and to procure a fic|titious
alienation to the Queen, who afterwards trans|ferred
the lands to the per&s;on agreed on<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 79.</NOTE>. This me|thod
of pillaging the church was not remedied till the
beginning of James the fir&s;t. The pre&s;ent depre&s;&s;ion
of the clergy expo&s;ed them to all injuries; and the
laity never &s;topped till they had reduced the church to
&s;uch poverty, that her plunder was no longer a compen|&s;ation
for the odium incurred by it.</P>
<P>A SOLEMN and public di&s;putation was held during
this &s;e&s;&s;ion, in pre&s;ence of Lord-keeper Bacon, be|tween
the divines of the prote&s;tant and tho&s;e of the
catholic party. The champions appointed to defend
the religion of the &s;overeign, were, as in former in|&s;tance,
entirely triumphant, and the popi&s;h di&s;putants,
being pronounced refractory and ob&s;tinate, were even
puni&s;hed by impri&s;onment<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 95.</NOTE>. Emboldened by this
victory, the prote&s;tants ventured on the la&s;t and mo&s;t
important &s;tep, and brought into Parliament a bill<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>
for aboli&s;hing the ma&s;s, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the li|turgy
of King Edward. Penalties were enacted, as
well again&s;t tho&s;e who departed from this mode of
wor&s;hip, as tho&s;e who ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the
church and the &s;acraments. And thus in one &s;e&s;&s;ion,
without any violence, tumult, or clamour, was the
whole &s;y&s;tem of religion altered, on the very commence|ment
of a reign, and by the will of a young woman,
who&s;e title to the crown was by many e&s;teemed liable
to great objections: An event, which, tho' it may ap|pear
&s;urpri&s;ing to men in the pre&s;ent age, was every
<PB N="13" REF="18">
where expected on the fir&s;t news of Elizabeth's ac|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE commons al&s;o made a &s;acrifice to the Queen,
more difficult to obtain than that of any articles of
religion: They voted a &s;ub&s;idy of four &s;hillings in the
pound on land, and two &s;hillings and eight pence on
goods, together with two fifteenths<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">The Parliament al&s;o granted the Queen the duties of tonnage and poun|dage; but this acce&s;&s;ion was at that time regarded only as a matter of form, and &s;he had levied the&s;e duties before they were voted by the Parlia|ment: But there was another exertion of power, which &s;he practi&s;ed, and which people, in this age, from their ignorance of the antient con|&s;titution, may be apt to think a little extraordinary. Her &s;i&s;ter, after the commencement of the war with France, had, from her own authority, impo&s;ed four marks on each ton of wine imported, and had encrea&s;ed the poundage a third on all commodities. Queen Elizabeth continued the&s;e impo&s;itions as long as &s;he thought convenient. The Parliament, who had &s;o good an opportunity of re&s;training the&s;e arbitrary taxes, when they voted the tonnage and poundage, thought proper not to make any men|tion of them. They knew, that the &s;overeign, during that age, pre|tended to have the &s;ole regulation of foreign trade, and that their inter|meddling with that prerogative would have drawn on them the &s;evere&s;t reproof, if not cha&s;ti&s;ement. See Forbes, vol. I. p. 132, 133. We know certainly from the &s;tatutes and journals, that no &s;uch impo&s;itions were granted by Parliament.</NOTE>. The hou&s;e in
no in&s;tance departed from the mo&s;t re&s;pectful defe|rence
and complai&s;ance towards the Queen. Even the
importunate addre&s;s, which they made her on the con|clu&s;ion
of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, to fix her choice of a hu&s;band,
could not, they &s;uppo&s;ed, be very di&s;agreeable to one
of her &s;ex and age. The addre&s;s was couched in the
mo&s;t re&s;pectful expre&s;&s;ions; yet met with a refu&s;al from
the Queen. She told the &s;peaker, that, as the appli|cation
from the hou&s;e was conceived in general terms,
only recommending marriage, without pretending to
direct her choice of a hu&s;band, &s;he could not take
offence at the addre&s;s, or regard it as other than a new
in&s;tance of their affectionate attachment towards her:
That any farther interpo&s;ition on their part would have
<PB N="14" REF="19">
ill become either them to make, as &s;ubjects, or her
to hear as an independant prince&s;s: That even while
&s;he was a private per&s;on, and expo&s;ed to much dan|ger,
&s;he had always declined that engagement, which
&s;he regarded as an incumbrance; much more, at pre|&s;ent
would &s;he per&s;evere in that &s;entiment, when the
charge of a great kingdom was committed to her, and
her life ought to be entirely devoted to promoting the
intere&s;ts of religion and the happine&s;s of her &s;ubjects:
That as England was her hu&s;band, wedded to her by
this pledge (and here &s;he &s;hewed them her finger with
the &s;ame gold ring upon it, with which &s;he had &s;olemn|ly
betrothed her&s;elf to the kingdom at her inagura|tion)
&s;o all Engli&s;hmen were her children; and while
&s;he was employed in the rearing or governing &s;uch a
family, &s;he could not deem her&s;elf barren, or her life
u&s;ele&s;s and unfruitful: That if &s;he ever entertained
thoughts of changing her condition, the care of her
&s;ubjects welfare would &s;till be uppermo&s;t in her
thoughts; but &s;hould &s;he live and die a virgin, &s;he
doubted not but the divine providence, &s;econded by
their coun&s;els and her own mea&s;ures, would be able
to prevent all di&s;pute with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
and &s;ecure them a &s;overeign, who, perhaps better than
her own i&s;&s;ue, would imitate her example in Ioving
and cheri&s;hing her people: And that for her part, &s;he
de&s;ired that no higher character, nor fairer remembrance
of her &s;hould be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, than to have
this in&s;cription engraved on her tomb-&s;tone, when &s;he
&s;hould pay the la&s;t debt to nature; &startq;Here lies Eliza|beth,

<P>AFTER the prorogation of the Parliament<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">It is thought remarkable by Camden, that tho' this &s;e&s;&s;ion was the fir&s;t of the reign, no per&s;on was attainted; but on the contrary, &s;ome re|&s;tored in blood by the Parliament. A good &s;ympton of the lenity, at lea&s;t of the prudence, of the Queen's government.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th May.</NOTE> the
laws enacted with regard to religion, were put in ex|execution,
<PB N="15" REF="20">
and met with no oppo&s;ition from any quar|ter.
The liturgy was again introduced in the vulgar
tongue, and the oath of &s;upremacy was tenderd to the
clergy. The number of bi&s;hops had been reduced to
fourteen by a very &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, which preceded; and
all of the&s;e, except the bi&s;hop of Landaffe, having re|fu&s;ed
compliance, were degraded from their &s;ees: But
of the inferior clergy throughout all England, where
there are near 10,000 $$ri&s;hes, only eighty pari&s;h
rectors, fifty prebendaries, fifteen heads of colleges,
twelve, archdeacons, and as many deans, &s;acrificed their
livings to their religious principles<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 376. Heylin, p. 115. Strype, vol. I. p. 73. with &s;ome &s;mall variations.</NOTE>. Tho&s;e in high
eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tations, who were expo&s;ed to the eyes of
the world, &s;eem chiefly to have placed a point of honour
in their pre&s;everance; but on the whole, the prote&s;|tants,
in the former change introduced by Mary, ap|pear
to have been much more rigid and con&s;cientious.
Tho' the catholic religion, adapting it&s;elf to the &s;en&s;es,
and requiring ob&s;ervances, which enter into the com|mon
train of life, does at pre&s;ent lay much fa&s;ter hold
of the mind than the reformed, which, being chiefly
&s;piritual, re&s;embles more a &s;y&s;tem of metaphy&s;icks;
yet was the proportion of zeal, as well as of knowledge,
during the fir&s;t ages after the reformation, much great|er
on the &s;ide of the prote&s;tants. The catholics con|tinued,
ignorantly and &s;upinely, in their antient belief,
or rather their antient practices: But the reformers,
obliged to di&s;pute on every occa&s;ion, and enflamed to
a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m by novelty and per&s;ecution, had
&s;trongly attached them&s;elves to their tenets; and were
ready to &s;acrifice their fortunes, and even their lives, in
defence of their &s;peculative and ab&s;tract principles.
<PB N="16" REF="21">
The forms and ceremonies, &s;till pre&s;erved in the Eng|li&s;h
liturgy, as they bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to the an|tient
&s;ervice, tended farther to reconcile the catholics
to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; and as the Queen permitted
no other mode of wor&s;hip, and at the &s;ame time &s;truck
out every thing that could be offen&s;ive to them in
the new liturgy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. III.</NOTE>, even tho&s;e addicted to the Romi&s;h
communion made no &s;cruple of attending the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
church. Had Elizabeth gratified her own in|clinations,
the exterior appearance, which is the chief
circum&s;tance with the people, would have been &s;till
more &s;imilar between the new and the antient form of
wor&s;hip. As &s;he loved &s;tate and magnificence in every
thing, &s;he was &s;omewhat addicted to the pomp of the
catholic religion; and it was merely in compliance
with the prejudices of her party, that &s;he gave up ei|ther
the images or the addre&s;&s;es to the &s;aints, or prayers
for the dead<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 376. 397. Camden, p. 371.</NOTE>. Some foreign princes interpo&s;ed to
procure the Romani&s;ts the privilege of &s;eparate a&s;&s;em|blies
in particular cities, but the Queen would not com|ply
with their reque&s;t; and repre&s;ented the manife&s;t dan|ger
of di&s;turbing the national peace by a toleration of
different religions<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 378. Strype, vol. I. p. 150. 370.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the Queen and Parliament were employed in
&s;ettling the public religion, the negotiations for a
peace were &s;till conducted fir&s;t at Cercamp, then at
Chateau-Cambre&s;is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France.</NOTE>, between the mini&s;ters of France,
Spain, and England; and Elizabeth, tho' equally pru|dent,
was not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in this tran&s;action. Philip
employed his utmo&s;t efforts to procure the re&s;titution
of Calais, both as bound in honour to indemnify Eng|land,
which, merely on his account, had been drawn
into the war, and as engaged in intere&s;t to remove
<PB N="17" REF="22">
France from his frontiers in the Low Countries. So
long as he entertained hopes of e&s;pou&s;ing the Queen,
he delayed concluding a peace with Henry; and even
after the change of religion in England deprived him
of all &s;uch views, his mini&s;ters hinted a propo&s;al, which
may be regarded as rea&s;onable and honourable. After
all his own terms with France were &s;ettled, he &s;eemed
willing to continue the war, till &s;he &s;hould obtain &s;atis|faction;
provided &s;he would &s;tipulate to adhere to the
Spani&s;h alliance, and continue ho&s;tilities again&s;t Hen|ry,
during the cour&s;e of &s;ix years.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Forbes's Full View, vol. I. p. 59.</NOTE>: But Elizabeth,
after con&s;ulting with her mini&s;ters, very wi&s;ely re|jected
this propo&s;al. She was &s;en&s;ible of the low &s;tate
of her finances; the great debts contracted by her fa|ther,
brother and &s;i&s;ter; the di&s;orders introduced into
every part of the admini&s;tration; the divi&s;ions by which
her people were agitated; and &s;he was convinced that
nothing but tranquillity during &s;ome years could
bring the kingdom again into a flouri&s;hing condition,
or enable her to act w$$h dignity and vigour, in her
tran&s;actions with foreign nations. Well acquainted
with the value which H$nry put upon Calais, and the
impo&s;&s;ibility of recovering it by treaty, during the pre|&s;ent
emergency, the was willing rather to &s;uffer that
lo&s;s, than &s;ubmit to &s;uch a dependance on Spain, as &s;he
mu&s;t expect to fall into, if &s;he continued pertinaciou&s;ly
in her pre&s;ent demand. She ordered, therefore, her am|ba&s;&s;adors,
the Lord Effingham, the bi&s;hop of Ely, and
Dr. Wotton, to conclude the negociation, and to &s;et|tle
a peace with Henry, on any rea&s;onable terms. Hen|ry
offered to &s;tipula$$ a marriage between the elde&s;t
daughter of the dauph$$, and the elde&s;t &s;on of Eliza|beth;
and to engage for the re&s;titution of Calais as the
dowry of that prince&s;s<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 54.</NOTE>; but as the Queen was &s;en|&s;ible
that this treaty would appear to the world a
<PB N="18" REF="23">
palpable eva&s;ion, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon more equitable, at
lea&s;t, more plau&s;ible conditions. It was at la&s;t agreed,
that Henry &s;hould re&s;tore Calais at the expiration of
eight years; that in ca&s;e of failure, he &s;hould pay five
hundred thou&s;and crowns, and the Queen's title to
Calais &s;till remain; that he &s;hould find the Security of
&s;even or eight foreign merchants, not natives of France,
for the payment of this &s;um; that he &s;hould deliver
five ho&s;tages till that &s;ecurity was provided; that if
Elizabeth broke the peace with France or Scotland
during that interval, &s;he &s;hould forfeit all title to Ca|lais;
but if Henry made war on Elizabeth, he &s;hould
be obliged immediately to re&s;tore that fortre&s;s<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Forbes, p. 6$. Rymer, tom. XV. p. 505.</NOTE>. All
men of penetration ea&s;ily &s;aw, that the&s;e &s;tipulations
were but a colourable pretence for abandoning Calais;
but they excu&s;ed the Queen on account of the nece&s;&s;ity
of her affairs, and they even extolled her prudence, in
&s;ubmitting, without further &s;truggle, to that nece&s;&s;ity.
A peace with Scotland was a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of
that with France.</P>
<P>PHILIP and Henry concluded ho&s;tilities with a mu|tual
re&s;titution of all places taken during the cour&s;e of
the war; and Philip e&s;pou&s;ed the prince&s;s Elizabeth,
elde&s;t daughter of France, formerly betrothed to his &s;on
Don Carlos. The duke of Savoy married Margaret,
Henry's &s;i&s;ter, and obtained a re&s;titution of all his do|minions
of Savoy and Piedmont, except a few towns,
retained by France. And thus general tranquillity &s;eem|ed
to be re&s;tored to Europe.</P>
<P>BUT tho' a peace was &s;igned and concluded between
France and England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;gu&s;t be|tween the Queen, and Mary Queen of Scots.</NOTE> there &s;oon appeared a ground of
quarrel, of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature, and which was after|wards
attended with the mo&s;t important con&s;equences.
The two marriages of Henry the eighth, that with Cathe|rine
of Arragon, and that with Anne Boleyn, were to|tally
incompatible with each other, and it &s;eemed im|impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="19" REF="24">
that both of them could be regarded as va|lid
and legal: But &s;till the birth of Elizabeth lay under
&s;ome di&s;advantages, to which that of her &s;i&s;ter, Mary,
was not expo&s;ed. Henry's fir&s;t marriage had obtained
the &s;anction of all the powers, both civil and eccle&s;i|a&s;tical,
which were then acknowledged in England;
and it was natural, for prote&s;tants as well as Roma|ni&s;ts,
to allow, on account of the &s;incere intention of
the parties, that their i&s;&s;ue ought to be regarded as le|gitimate.
But his divorce, and &s;econd marriage,
had been concluded in direct oppo&s;ition to the &s;ee
of Rome; and tho' they had been ratified by the au|thority
both of the Engli&s;h Parliament and convocation,
tho&s;e who were &s;trongly attached to the catholic
church, and who rea&s;oned with great &s;trictne&s;s,
were lead to regard them as entirely invalid, and to
deny altogether the Queen's right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The
next heir of blood was the Queen of Scots, now mar|ried
to the dauphin; and the great power of that prin|ce&s;s,
joined to her plau&s;ible title, rendered her a very
formidable rival to Elizabeth. The King of France
had &s;ecretly been &s;olliciting at Rome a bull of excom|munication
again&s;t the Queen; and &s;he had here been
beholden to the good offices of Philip, who, from in|tere&s;t
more than either friend&s;hip or principle, had ne|gociated
in her favour, and had &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed
the preten&s;ions of Henry. But the court of France
was not di&s;couraged with this repul&s;e: The duke of
Gui&s;e, and his brothers, thinking, that it would much
augment their credit, if their niece &s;hould bring an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of England, as &s;he had already done of Scot|land,
to the crown of France, engaged the King not to
neglect the claim; and, by their per&s;ua&s;ion, he ordered
his &s;on and daughter-in-law to a&s;&s;ume openly the arms
as well as title of England, and to quarter the&s;e arms
on all their equipages, furniture, and liveries. When
<PB N="20" REF="25">
the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador complained of this injury, he
could obtain nothing but an eva&s;ive an&s;wer; that as
the Queen of Scots was de&s;cended from the blood royal
of England, &s;he was entitled, by the example of many
princes, to a&s;&s;ume the arms of that kingdom. But be|&s;ides
that this practice had never prevailed without per|mi&s;&s;ion
being fir&s;t obtained, and without making a vi|&s;ible
difference between the arms, Elizabeth plainly
&s;aw, that this preten&s;ion had not been advanced during
the reign of her &s;i&s;ter Mary; and that, therefore, the
King of France intended, on the fir&s;t opportunity, to
di&s;pute her legitimacy, and her title to the crown. Alar|med
with the danger, &s;he thenceforth conceived a &s;trong
jealou&s;y again&s;t the Queen of Scots; and was determi|ned,
as far as po&s;&s;ible, to incapacitate Henry from the
execution of his project. The &s;udden death of that
monarch, who was killed in a tournament at Paris,
while he was celebrating the e&s;pou&s;als of his &s;i&s;ter with
the duke of Savoy, altered not her views. Being in|formed,
that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Francis the &s;econd, &s;till con|tinued
to a&s;&s;ume, without re&s;erve, the title of King of
England, &s;he began to con&s;ider him and his Queen as
her mo&s;t mortal enemies; and the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of
affairs in Scotland afforded her a favourable opportu|nity,
both of revenging the injury, and of providing
for her own &s;afety.</P>
<P>THE murder of the cardinal-primate at St. Andrews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE>
had deprived the Scots catholics of a head who&s;e &s;eve|rity,
courage, and capacity had rendered him extreme|ly
formidable to the innovators in religion; and the ex|ecution
of the Laws again&s;t here&s;y began thenceforth to
be much more remi&s;s and gentle. The Queen-regent
governed the Kingdom by prudent and moderate coun|cils;
and as &s;he was not di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice the civil
intere&s;ts of the &s;tate to the bigotry or intere&s;ts of prie&s;ts,
&s;he deemed it more expedient to temporize, and to
<PB N="21" REF="26">
connive at the progre&s;s of a doctrine which &s;he had not
power entirely to repre&s;s. When informed of the
death of Edward, and the acce&s;&s;ion of Mary to the
crown of England, &s;he entertained hopes, that the
Scotti&s;h reformers, deprived of the countenance which
they received from that powerful kingdom, would lo&s;e
their ardour with their pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, and would
gradually return to the faith of their ance&s;tors. But
the progre&s;s and revolutions of religion are little go|verned
by the u&s;ual maxims of civil policy; and the
event much di&s;appointed the regent's expectations. Ma|ny
of the Engli&s;h preachers, terri$ied with the &s;everity
of Mary's government, took &s;helter in Scotland, where
they found more protection, and a milder admini&s;tra|tion;
and while they propagated their theological tenets,
they filled that whole kingdom with a ju&s;t horror
again&s;t the cruelties of the bigotted catholics, and &s;how|ed
their di&s;ciples the fate which they mu&s;t expect, if
ever their adver&s;aries &s;hould attain an uncontrouled au|thority
over them.</P>
<P>A HIERARCHY, moderate in its acqui&s;itions of pow|er
and riches, may &s;afely grant a toleration to &s;ectaries;
and the more it debates the fervor of innovators by le|nity
and liberty, the more &s;ecurely will it po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e
advantages which the legal e&s;tabli&s;hments be&s;tow upon
it. But where &s;uper&s;tition has rai&s;ed a church to &s;uch
an exorbitant height as that of Rome, per&s;ecution is
le&s;s the re&s;ult of bigotry in the prie&s;ts, than of a nece&s;&s;a|ry
policy; and the rigour of law is the only method of
repelling the attacks of men, who, be&s;ides religious
zeal, have &s;o many other motives, derived both from
public and private intere&s;t, to engage them on the &s;ide
of innovation. But tho' &s;uch overgrown hierarchies
may long &s;upport them&s;elves by the&s;e violent expedi|ents,
the time comes, when &s;everities tend only to en|rage
the new &s;ectaries, and make them break thro' all
<PB N="22" REF="27">
bounds of rea&s;on and moderation. This cri&s;is was now
vi&s;ibly approaching in Scotland; and whoever con&s;iders
merely the tran&s;actions re&s;ulting from it, will be incli|ned
to throw the blame equally on both parties; who|ever
enlarges his view, and reflects on the &s;ituations,
will ob&s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary progre&s;s of human affairs, and
the operation of tho&s;e principles which are inherent in
human nature.</P>
<P>SOME heads of the reformers in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reformation in Scotland.</NOTE> &s;uch as the
earl of Argyle, his &s;on lord Lorne, the earls of Morton,
and Glencarne, Er&s;kine of Dun, and others, finding the
danger to which they were expo&s;ed, and de&s;irous to
propagate their principles, entered privately into a bond
or a&s;&s;ociation; and called them&s;elves the <HI>Congregation</HI>
of the Lord, in contradi&s;tinction to the e&s;tabli&s;hed
church, which they denominated the congregation of
Satan. The tenor of the bond was as follows: &startq;We,
perceiving how Satan, in his members, the anti|chri&s;ts
of our time, do cruelly rage, &s;eeking to over|throw
and to de&s;troy the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t and his
congregation, ought, according to our bounden
duty, to &s;trive, in our ma&s;ter's cau&s;e, even unto the
death, being certain of the victory in him. We do
therefore promi&s;e, before the maje&s;ty of God and his
congregation, that we, by his grace, &s;hall with all
diligence continually apply our whole power, &s;ub|&s;tance,
and our very lives, to maintain, &s;et forward,
and e&s;tabli&s;h the mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed word of God and his
congregation; and &s;hall labour, by all po&s;&s;ible means,
to have faithful mini&s;ters, truly and purely to mi|ni&s;ter
Chri&s;t's go&s;pel and &s;acraments to his people:
We &s;hall maintain them, nouri&s;h them, and defend
them, the whole congregation of Chri&s;t, and every
member thereof, by our whole power, and at the
hazard of our lives, again&s;t Satan, and all wicked
power, who may intend tyranny and trouble again&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="28">
the &s;aid congregation: Unto which holy word and
congregation we do join our&s;elves; and we for&s;ake
and renounce the congregation of Satan, with all
the &s;uper&s;titious abomination and idolatry thereof;
and moreover &s;hall declare our&s;elves manife&s;tly ene|mies

te&s;tified to this congregation by our &s;ub&s;criptions.

<P>HAD the &s;ub&s;cribers of this zealous league been con|tented
only to demand a toleration of the new opinions;
however incompatible their preten&s;ions might have been
with the policy of the church of Rome, they would
have had the prai&s;e of oppo&s;ing tyrannical laws, enacted
to &s;upport an e&s;tabli&s;hment prejudicial to civil &s;ociety:
But it is plain, that they carried their views much far|ther;
and their practi&s;e immediately di&s;covered the &s;pi|rit
by which they were actuated. Supported by the
authority which, they thought, belonged to them as the
congregation of the Lord, they ordained that prayers
in the vulgar tongue<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">The reformers u&s;ed at that time King Edward's liturgy in Scotland. Forbes, p. 155.</NOTE> &s;hould be u&s;ed in all the pari&s;h
churches of the kingdom; and that preaching, and the
interpretation of the &s;criptures &s;hould be practi&s;ed in pri|vate
hou&s;es, till God &s;hould move the prince to grant pub|lic
preaching by faithful and true mini&s;ters<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 66. Knox, p. 101.</NOTE>. Such bonds
of a&s;&s;ociation are always the forerunners of rebellion;
and this violent inva&s;ion of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion was
the actual commencement of it.</P>
<P>BEFORE this league was publickly known or avowed,
the clergy, alarmed with the progre&s;s of the reforma|tion,
attempted to recover their lo&s;t authority, by a vi|olent
exerci&s;e of power, which tended &s;till farther to
augment the zeal and number of their enemies. Ha|milton,
the primate, &s;eized Walter Mill, a prie&s;t of an
<PB N="24" REF="29">
irreproachable life, who had embraced the new doc|trines;
and having tried him at St. Andrews, condem|ned
him to the flames for here&s;y. Such general aver&s;i|on
was di&s;covered to this barbarity, that it was &s;ome
time before the bi&s;hops could prevail on any one to act
the part of a civil judge, and pronounce the &s;entence
upon him; and even after the time of his execution
was fixed, all the &s;hops of St. Andrews being &s;hut, no
one would &s;ell a rope to tie him to the &s;take, and the
primate him&s;elf was obliged to furni&s;h this implement.
The man bore the torture with that courage which,
tho' u&s;ual on the&s;e occa&s;ions, always appears a&s;toni&s;h|ing
and &s;upernatural to the multitude: The people, to
expre&s;s their abhorrence again&s;t the cruelty of the
prie&s;ts, rai&s;ed a monument of &s;tones on the place of his
execution; and as fa&s;t as the &s;tones were removed by or|der
of the clergy, they were again &s;upplied from the
voluntary zeal of the populace<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 122.</NOTE>. It is in vain for men
to oppo&s;e the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments to the united motives
of religion and public applau&s;e; and this was the la&s;t
barbarity of the kind which the catholics had the pow|er
to exerci&s;e in Scotland.</P>
<P>SOME time after, the people di&s;covered their &s;enti|ments
in &s;uch a manner as was &s;ufficient to progno&s;ti|cate
to the prie&s;ts, the fate which was awaiting them.
It was u&s;ual on the fe&s;tival of St. Giles, the tutelar
&s;aint of Edinburgh, to carry in proce&s;&s;ion the image of
that &s;aint; but the prote&s;tants, in order to prevent the
ceremony, found means, on the eve of the fe&s;tival, to
purloin the &s;tatue from the church, and they plea&s;ed
them&s;elves with imagining the a&s;toni&s;hment and
di&s;appointment of his votaries. The clergy, however,
framed ha&s;tily a new image, which, in deri&s;ion, was cal|led
by the people young St. Giles; and they carried it
thro' the &s;treets, attended with all the eccle&s;ia&s;tics in the
<PB N="25" REF="30">
town and neighbourhood. The multitude ab&s;tained
from violence &s;o long as the Queen-regent continued
a &s;pectator, but the moment &s;he retired, they invaded
the idol, threw it in the dirt, and broke it in pieces.
The flight and terror of the prie&s;ts and fryars, who, it
was remarked, de&s;erted, in his greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, the object
of their wor&s;hip, was the &s;ource of univer&s;al mockery
and laughter,</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by all the&s;e appearances, the congre|gation
proceeded with alacrity in openly &s;olliciting &s;ub|&s;criptions
of their league; and the death of Mary of
England, with the acce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth, which hap|pened
about this time, contributed much to increa&s;e
their hopes of final &s;ucce&s;s in their undertaking. They
ventured to pre&s;ent a petition to the regent, craving a
reformation of the church, and of the <HI>wicked, &s;candalous,</HI>
and <HI>dete&s;table</HI> lives of the prelates and eccle&s;ia&s;ticks<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 121.</NOTE>.
They framed a Petition, which they intended to pre&s;ent
to Parliament, and in which, after premi&s;ing, that they
could not communicate with the damnable idolatry,
and intolerable abu&s;es of the papi&s;tical church, they de|&s;ired,
that the laws again&s;t heretics &s;hould be executed
by the civil magi&s;trate alone, and that the &s;cripture
&s;hould be the &s;ole rule for judging of here&s;y<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 123.</NOTE>. They
even petitioned the convocation, and in&s;i&s;ted that prary|ers
&s;hould be &s;aid in the vulgar tongue, and that bi&s;hops
&s;hould be cho&s;en with the con&s;ent of the gentry of the
dioce&s;e, and prie&s;ts with the con&s;ent of the pari&s;hio|ners<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 78, 81, 82.</NOTE>. The regent prudently temporized between the&s;e
parties; and as &s;he aimed at procuring a matrimonial
crown for her &s;on-in-law, the dauphin, &s;he was, on
that as well as other accounts, unwilling to come to ex|tremities
with either of them.</P>
<P>BUT after this conce&s;&s;ion was obtained, &s;he received
orders from France, probably dictated by the haughty
<PB N="26" REF="31">
&s;pirit of her brothers, to proceed with violence again&s;t
the reformers, and to re&s;tore the royal authority, by
&s;ome &s;ignal act of power<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Melvil's Memoirs, p. 24. Jebb, vol. II. p. 446.</NOTE>. She made the mo&s;t eminent
of the prote&s;tant teachers be cited to appear before the
council at Stirling; but when their followers were
marching thither in great multitudes, in order to pro|tect
and countenance them, &s;he entertained apprehen&s;i|ons
of an in&s;urrection, and di&s;&s;ipated the people by a
promi&s;e<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 127. We &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t afterwards &s;ome rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect, that, perhaps, no expre&s;s promi&s;e was given. Calumnies, ea&s;ily ari&s;e during times of faction, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the religious kind, when men think eve|ry art lawful for promoting their purpo&s;e. The congregation in their mani|fe&s;to, where they enumerate all the articles of the regent's mal-admini&s;tra|tion, do not reproach her with this breach of promi&s;e. It was probably no|thing but a rumour &s;pread abroad to catch the populace. If the papi&s;ts have &s;ometimes maintained, that no faith was to be kept with heretics, their adver&s;aries &s;eem al&s;o to have thought, that no truth ought to be told of idolaters.</NOTE>, that nothing &s;hould be done to the preju|dice
of the mini&s;ters. This promi&s;e was violated; and
a &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed, by which all the mini&s;ters were pro|nounced
rebels, on account of their not appearing. A
mea&s;ure, &s;o ra&s;h and ill advi&s;ed, enraged the people, and
made them re&s;olve to re&s;i&s;t her authority by force of
arms, and to proceed to extremity again&s;t the clergy of
the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion.</P>
<P>IN this critical time John Knox arrived from Gene|va,
where he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years in bani&s;hment, and
where he had imbibed, from his commerce with Calvin,
the highe&s;t fanatici&s;m of his &s;ect, augmented by the na|tural
ferocity of his own character. He had been invi|ted
back to Scotland by the leaders of the reformation;
and mounting the pulpit at Perth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th May.</NOTE> during the pre&s;ent
ferment of mens minds, he declaimed with his u&s;ual ve|hemence
again&s;t the idolatry and other abominations of
the church of Rome, and incited his audience to exert
their utmo&s;t zeal for its &s;ubver&s;ion. A prie&s;t was &s;o im|prudent,
after this &s;ermon, as to open his repo&s;itory of
<PB N="27" REF="32">
images and reliques, and prepare him&s;elf to &s;ay ma&s;s.
The audience, who were wrought up to a di&s;po&s;ition
for any furious enterpri&s;e, were as much enraged as if
the &s;pectacle had not been quite familiar to them: They
attacked the prie&s;t with fury, broke the images in pieces,
tore the pictures, overthrew the altars, &s;cattred about
the &s;acred va&s;es; and left no implement of idolatrous
wor&s;hip, as they called it, entire or unbroken. They
thence proceeded with additional numbers, and aug|mented
rage, to the mona&s;teries of the Grey and Black
friars, which they pillaged in an in&s;tant: The Carthu|&s;ians
underwent the &s;ame fate; and the populace, not
content with robbing and expelling the monks, vented
their fury on the buildings, which had been the recep|ticles
of &s;uch abomination; and in a very little time no|thing
but the walls of the&s;e &s;tately edifices were left
&s;tanding. The inhabitants of Couper in Fife &s;oon af|ter
imitated the example<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 121. Knox, p. 127.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen-regent, provoked at the&s;e violences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars in Scotland.</NOTE> a&s;|&s;embled
an army, and prepared to cha&s;ti&s;e the rebels.
She had about two thou&s;and French under her com|mand,
with a few Scots troops; and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted with
&s;uch of the nobility as were well affected to her, &s;he
pitched her camp within ten miles of Perth. Even the
earl of Argyle, and the lord James Stuart, prior of St.
Andrew's, the Queen's natural brother, tho' deeply en|gaged
with the reformers, attended the regent in this
enterpri&s;e, either becau&s;e they blamed the fury of the po|pulace,
or hoped by their influence and authority to medi|ate
&s;ome agreement between the parties. The congrega|tion,
on the other hand, made preparations for defence;
and being joined by the earl of Glencarne from the we&s;t,
and being countenanced by many of the nobility and gen|try,
they appeared formidable from their numbers, as well
as from the zeal by which they were animated. They

&s;ent an addre&s;s to the regent, where they plainly in&s;i|nuated,
that if they were pur&s;ued to extremity, by the
cruel bea&s;ts, the churchmen, they would have recour&s;e
to foreign powers for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and they &s;ub&s;cribed
them&s;elves her faithful &s;ubjects in all things not repug|nant
to God; a&s;&s;uming, at the &s;ame time, the name of
the faithful congregation of Chri&s;t Je&s;us<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">s Knox, p. 129.</NOTE>. They ap|plied
to the nobility attending her, and maintained, that
their pa&s;t violences were ju&s;tified by the word of God,
which commands the godly to de&s;troy idolatry, and all
the monuments of it; that tho' all civil authority was
&s;acred, yet was there a great difference between the au|thority
and the per&s;ons who exerci&s;ed it<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 131.</NOTE>; and that
it ought to be con&s;idered whether or not tho&s;e abomina|tions,
called by the pe&s;tilent papi&s;ts, religion, and which
they defend by fire and &s;word, be the true religion of
Chri&s;t Je&s;us. They remon&s;trated with &s;uch of the
Queen's army as had formerly embraced their party, and
told them, &startq;That as they were already reputed trai|tors
by God, they &s;hould likewi&s;e be excommunica|ted
from their &s;ociety, and from the participation of
the &s;acraments of the church, which God by his
mighty power had erected among them; who&s;e mi|ni&s;ters
have the &s;ame authority which Chri&s;t granted
to his apo&s;tles in the&s;e words, <HI>Who&s;e &s;ins ye &s;hall for|give

&s;aints were no le&s;s lofty in their preten&s;ions than the an|cient
hierarchy; and it was therefore no wonder they
were enraged again&s;t the latter as their rivals in domi|nion.
They joined to all the&s;e declarations an addre&s;s to
the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; and they affixed this title to it.
&startq;To the generation of antichri&s;t, the pe&s;tilent prelates

Chri&s;t Je&s;us within the &s;ame &s;ayeth.&endq; The tenor of
the manife&s;to was agreeable to the title. They told the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics, &startq;As ye by tyranny intend not only to de|&s;troy
our bodies, but al&s;o by the &s;ame to hold our
&s;ouls in bondage of the devil, &s;ubject to idolatry; &s;o

&s;hall grant unto us, execute ju&s;t vengeance and pu|ni&s;hment

war which God commanded I&s;rael to execute
again&s;t the Canaanites; that is; contract of peace
&s;hall never be made, till you de&s;i&s;t from your open
idolatry, and cruel per&s;ecution of God's children.
And in this, in the name of the eternal God, and of
his &s;on, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who&s;e verity we profe&s;s, and
Go&s;pel we have preached, and holy &s;acraments right|ly
admini&s;tred, we &s;ignify unto you, to be our in|tent,

on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE Queen-regent, finding &s;uch ob&s;tinate zeal in
the malecontents, was contented to embrace the coun|cils
of Argyle and the prior of St. Andrew's, and to
form an accommodation with them. She was received
into Perth, which &s;ubmitted to her on promi&s;ing an
indemnity of pa&s;t offences, and engaging not to leave
any French garri&s;on in the place. This capitulation,
it is pretended, was not exactly ob&s;erved. Some of the
inhabitants were mole&s;ted on account of the late vio|lences;
and &s;ome companies of Scots &s;oldiers, &s;uppo&s;ed
to be in French pay, were quartered in the town;
<PB N="30" REF="37">
which &s;tep, tho' taken on a very plau&s;ible pretence,
was regarded by the congregation as an infraction of the
treaty<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 139.</NOTE>. It is a&s;&s;erted, that the regent, to ju&s;tify the&s;e
mea&s;ures declared, that princes ought not to have their
promi&s;es too &s;trictly urged upon them; nor was any faith
to be kept with heretics: And that for her part, could
&s;he find as good a colour of rea&s;on, &s;he would willingly
bereave all the&s;e men of their lives and fortunes<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Spot&s;wood, p. 123.</NOTE>. But
it is no wi&s;e likely, that &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions dropt from this
prudent and virtuous prince&s;s. On the contrary, it ap|pears,
that the&s;e violences were very di&s;agreeable to
her; that &s;he was in this particular over-ruled by the
authority of the French coun&s;ellors placed about her; and
that &s;he often thought, if the management of the&s;e affairs
had been entru&s;ted wholly to her&s;elf, &s;he could ea&s;ily,
without force, have accommodated all differences<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 146. Melvil, p. 29. Knox, p. 225, 228. Le&s;ly, lib. 2. That there was really no violation of the capitulation of Perth, appears from the manife&s;to of the congregation in Knox, p. 184. where it is not &s;o much as pretended. The companies of Scots &s;oldiers were, probably, in Scots pay, &s;ince the congregation complains, that the country was oppre&s;&s;ed with taxes to maintain armies. Knox, p. 164, 165. And even if they had been in French pay&punc; it were no breach of the capitulation, &s;ince they wer$ national troops, not French. Knox does not &s;ay, p. 139, that any of the inhabitants of Perth were tried or puni&s;hed for their pa&s;t offences; but only that they were oppre&s;&s;ed with the quartering of $oldiers: And the congregation in their mani|fe&s;to, &s;ay only that many of them had fled for fear. This plain detection of the calumny with regard to the breach of the capitulation of Perth, may make us &s;u&s;pect a like calumny with regard to the promi&s;e pretended not to give &s;entence again&s;t the mini&s;ters. The affair lay altogether between the re|gent and the laird of Dun; and that gentleman, tho' a man of &s;en&s;e and cha|racter, might be willing to take &s;ome general profe&s;&s;ions for promi&s;es. If the Queen, overawed by the power of the congregation, gave &s;uch a promi&s;e in order to have liberty to proceed to a &s;entence; how could &s;he expect to have power to execute a &s;entence &s;o treacherou&s;ly obtained? And to what purpo&s;e could it &s;erve?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE congregation enflamed with their own zeal,
and enraged with the&s;e di&s;appointments, remained not
<PB N="31" REF="38">
long in tranquillity. Even before they left Perth, and
while as yet they had no colour to complain of any vi|olation
of treaty, they had &s;igned a new covenant, in
which, be&s;ides their engagements to mutual defence,
they vowed in the name of God to employ their whole
power in de&s;troying every thing that di&s;honoured his
holy name; and this covenant was &s;ub&s;cribed, among
others, by Argyle and the prior of St. Andrew's<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 89. Knox, p. 138.</NOTE>.
The&s;e two leaders now de&s;ired no better Pretence for
de&s;erting the regent and openly joining their a&s;&s;ociates,
than the complaints, however doubtful, or rather fal&s;e,
of her breach of promi&s;e. The congregation al&s;o, en|couraged
by this acce&s;&s;ion of force, gave them&s;elves up
entirely to the furious zeal of Knox, and renewed at
Crail, An&s;truther, and other places in Fife, like depre|dations,
on the churches, and mona&s;teries with tho&s;e
formerly committed at Perth and Couper. The regent,
who marched again&s;t them with her army, finding
their power &s;o much increa&s;ed, was glad to conclude a
truce for a few days, and to pa&s;s over with her forces to
the Lothians. The reformers be&s;ieged and took Perth;
proceeded thence to Stirling, where they exerci&s;ed their
u&s;ual fury; and finding nothing able to re&s;i&s;t them,
they bent their march to Edinburgh, the inhabitants of
which, as they had already anticipated the zeal of the
congregation again&s;t the churches and mona&s;teries,
gladly opened their gates to them. The regent, with
the few forces which remained with her, took &s;hel|ter
in Dunbar, where &s;he &s;hut her&s;elf up, in expec|tation
of a reinforcement from France.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, &s;he employed her partizans in repre|&s;enting
to the people the dangerous con&s;equences of this
open rebellion; and &s;he endeavoured to convince them,
that the lord James, under pretence of religion, had
<PB N="32" REF="39">
formed the &s;cheme of wre&s;ting the &s;cepter from the
hands of the &s;overeign. By the&s;e con&s;iderations many
were engaged to de&s;ert the army of the congregation;
but much more by the want of pay or any means of
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance; and the regent, ob&s;erving the in&s;urgents to
be much weakened, ventured to march to Edinburgh,
with a de&s;ign to &s;uppre&s;s them. On the interpo&s;ition
of the duke of Chatelraut, who &s;till adhered to her, &s;he
agreed to a capitulation, in which &s;he granted them a
toleration of their religion, and they engaged to commit
no farther depredations on the churches. Soon after
they evacuated the city of Edinburgh; and before they
left it, they proclaimed the articles of agreement; but
they took care to publi&s;h only the articles favourable to
them&s;elves, and they were guilty of an impo&s;ture, in
adding one to the number, viz. that idolatry &s;hall not
again be erected in any place where it was at that time
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 153, 154, 155. This author pretends that this article was agreed to verbally, but that the Queen's &s;cribes omitted it in the treaty which was &s;igned. This &s;tory is very unlikely, or rather very ab&s;urd; and in the mean time it is allowed, that the article is not in the treaty: Nor do the con|gregation in their &s;ub&s;equent manife&s;to in&s;i&s;t upon it. Knox, p. 184.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN agreement concluded, while men's minds were in
this di&s;po&s;ition, could nor be durable; and both &s;ides en|deavoured
to &s;trenghten them&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible,
again&s;t the en&s;uing rupture, which appeared inevitable.
The regent, having got a reinforcement of 1000 men
from France, began to fortify Leith; and the congrega|tion
&s;educed the duke of Chatelraut to their party, who
had long appeared inclined to them, and who was at
la&s;t determine by the arirval of his &s;on, the earl of Ar|ran,
from Fra$ce, where he had e&s;caped many dangers,
from the jealou&s;y, as well as bigotry, of Henry and the
duke of Gui&s;e. More French troops &s;oon after di&s;em|barked
under the command of La Bro&s;&s;e, who was $ol|followed
<PB N="33" REF="40">
by the bi&s;hop of Amiens, and three doctors of
the Sorbonne. The&s;e la&s;t were &s;upplied with &s;tore of
&s;yllogi&s;ms, authorities, citations, and &s;chola&s;tic argu|ments,
which they intended $word$ oppo&s;e to the Scots
preachers, and which, they ju&s;tly pre&s;umed, would ac|quire
force, and operate conviction on mens minds, by
the influence of the French arms and artillery<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 134. Thuan. lib. xxiv. c. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE con&s;table Montmorency had always oppo&s;ed the
marriage of the Queen of Scots with the dauphin, and
had foretold, that, by forming &s;uch clo&s;e connexions
with Scotland, the antient league would be di&s;&s;olved;
and the natives of that kingdom, jealous of a foreign
yoke, would &s;oon become, in&s;tead of allies, attached by
intere&s;t and inclination, the mo&s;t inveterate enemies to
the French dominion. But tho' the event &s;eemed now
to have ju&s;tified the prudence of that aged mini&s;ter, it is
not impropable, con&s;idering the violence of the councils,
by which France was governed, that the in&s;urrection
was e&s;teemed a favourable event; as affording a pre|tence
for &s;ending over armies, for entirely &s;ubduing the
country, for attainting the rebels<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 139. Thuan. lib. xxiv. c. 13.</NOTE>, and for preparing
means thence to invade England, and &s;upport Mary's
title to the crown of that kingdom. The leaders of
the congregation, well acquainted with the&s;e views,
were not in&s;en&s;ible of their danger, and &s;aw that their
only &s;afety con&s;i&s;ted in the vigour and &s;ucce&s;s of their
mea&s;ures. They were encouraged by the intelligence
received of the &s;udden death of Henry the &s;econd; and
having pa&s;&s;ed an act from their own authority, de|priving
the Queen dowager of the regency, and order|ing
all the French troops to evacuate the kingdom,
they collected forces to put their edict in execution
again&s;t them. They became ma&s;ters again of Edin|burgh;
but found them&s;elves unable to keep long po&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion

of that city. Their tumultuary armies, a&s;&s;em|bled
in ha&s;te, and &s;upported by no pay, &s;oon &s;eparated
them&s;elves upon the lea&s;t di&s;a&s;ter, or even any delay of

troops as the French, who were al&s;o &s;econded by &s;ome
of the Scots nobility, among whom the earl of Both|wel
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf. Hearing that the marquis of
Elbeuf, brother to the regent, was levying a new ar|my
again&s;t them in Germany, they thought them&s;elves
excu&s;able for applying, in this extremity, to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England; and as the &s;ympathy of religion,
as well as regard to national liberty, had now counter|ballanced

had employed every expedient, both of war and

her &s;ituation &s;he proceeded with celerity to a deci&s;ion;

clergy lawful prey, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without cere|mony,
of the far greater part of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical reve|nues.
Their new preachers, who had authority &s;uffi|cient
to incite them to war and in&s;urrection, could not
re&s;train their rapacity; and fanatici&s;m concurring with
a$arice, an incurable blow was given to the papal au|thority
in that country. The prote&s;tant nobility and
gentry, united by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch unpardona|ble
guilt, alarmed for their new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, well ac|quainted
with the imperious character of the hou&s;e of
Gui&s;e, &s;aw no &s;afety for them&s;elves but in the protec|tion
of England; and they di&s;patched Morton, Glen|carne,
and Ledington to expre&s;s their &s;incere gratitude
to the Queen for her pa&s;t favours, and to repre&s;ent to
her the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing them.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH had equal rea&s;on to maintain an union
with the Scots prote&s;tants;<NOTE PLACE="marg">French af|fairs.</NOTE> and &s;oon found, that the
<PB N="41" REF="50">
hou&s;e of Gui&s;e, notwith&s;tanding their pa&s;t di&s;appoint|ments,
had not laid a&s;ide the de&s;ign of conte&s;ting her ti|tle,
and &s;ubverting her authority. Francis and Mary,
who&s;e councils were wholly directed by them, refu&s;ed
to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh; and &s;howed no di&s;po|&s;ition
to give her any &s;atisfaction for that mortal inju|ry
and affront which they had put upon her, by &s;o
openly a&s;&s;uming the title and arms of England. She
was &s;en&s;ible of the danger attending &s;uch preten&s;ions;
and it was with plea&s;ure &s;he heard of the violent factions,
which prevailed in the French government, and of the
oppo&s;ition, which had ari&s;en again&s;t the mea&s;ure sof the
duke of Gui&s;e. That ambitious prince, &s;upported by
his four brothers, the cardinal of Lorraine, the duke of
Aumale, the marquis of Elbeuf, and the grand prior,
men no le&s;s ambitious than him&s;elf, had engro&s;&s;ed all
the authority of the crown: and as he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
every quality, which could command the e&s;teem or &s;e|duce
the affections of men, there appeared no end of his
acqui&s;itions and preten&s;ions. The con&s;table Montmo|rency,
who had long ballanced his credit, was depri|ved
of all power: The princes of the blood, the King
of Navarre and his brother the prince of Cond&eacute;, were
entirely excluded from offices and favour: The Queen|mother
her&s;elf, Catherine de Medicis, found her influ|ence
every day declining: And as Francis, a young
prince, infirm both in mind and body, was wholly go|verned
by his &s;pou&s;e, who knew no law but the plea|&s;ure
of her uncles, men de&s;paired of ever obtaining free|dom
from the dominion of that a&s;piring family. It
was the conte&s;ts of religion, which fir&s;t in&s;pired the
French with courage openly to oppo&s;e their exorbitant
authority.</P>
<P>THE theological di&s;putes, fir&s;t &s;tarted in the north of
Germany, and next in Switzerland, countries at that
<PB N="42" REF="51">
time wholly illiterate, had long ago penetrated into
France; and as they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the general di&s;con|tents
again&s;t the court and church of Rome, and by the
zealous &s;pirit of the age, the pro&s;elytes to the new reli|ligion
were &s;ecretly encrea&s;ing in every province. Hen|ry
the &s;econd, in imitation of his father Francis, had op|po&s;ed
the progre&s;s of the reformers; and tho' a prince
addicted to plea&s;ure and &s;ociety, he was tran&s;ported by
a vehemence, as well as bigotry, which had little place
in his predece&s;&s;or's conduct. Rigorous puni&s;hments had
been inflicted on the mo&s;t eminent of the prote&s;tant par|ty;
and a point of honour &s;eemed to have ari&s;en, whe|ther
the one &s;ect could exerci&s;e or the other &s;uffer mo&s;t
barbarity. The death of Henry put &s;ome &s;top to the
per&s;ecutions; and the people, who had admired the con|&s;tancy
of the new preachers, now heard with favour
and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion their arguments and doctrines. But
the cardinal of Lorrain, as well as his brother, who
were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the legal authority, thought it their
intere&s;t to &s;upport the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; and when
they revived the exerci&s;e of the penal &s;tatutes, they ne|ce&s;&s;arily
engaged the malecontent princes and nobles in
the protection of the new religion. The King of Na|varre,
a man of mild di&s;po&s;itions, but of a weak charac|ter,
and the prince of Cond&eacute;, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many heroic
qualities, having declared them&s;elves in favour of the
prote&s;tants, that &s;ect acquired new force from their
countenance; and the admiral de Coligni, with his bro|ther
Andelot, no longer &s;crupled to declare them&s;elves
openly of their communion. The integrity of the ad|miral,
who was believed &s;incere in his profe&s;&s;ion, and
his high renown both for valour and conduct, for the
arts of peace as well as of war, gave credit to the re|formers;
and after a fru&s;trated attempt of the malecon|tents
to &s;eize the King's per&s;on at Amboi&s;e, of which
<PB N="43" REF="52">
Elizabeth had probably &s;ome intelligence<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. I. p. 214. Throcmorton&punc; about this time, unwilling to en|tru&s;t to letters the great &s;ecrets committed to him, obtained leave, under &s;ome pretext, to come over to London.</NOTE>, every place
was full of di&s;traction, and matters ha&s;tened to an ex|tremity
between the parties. But the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e,
tho' the&s;e factions had obliged them to remit their ef|forts
in Scotland, and had been one chief cau&s;e of Eli|zabeth's
&s;ucce&s;s, were determined not to relinqui&s;h
their authority in France, or yield to the $$olence of
their antagoni&s;ts. They found an opportunity to &s;eize
the King of Navarre and the prince of Cond&eacute;; they
threw the former into pri&s;on; they obtained a &s;entence
of death again&s;t the latter; and they were proceeding to
put the &s;entence in execution, when the king's &s;udden
death &s;aved the noble pri&s;oner, and interrupted the pro&s;|perity
of the duke of Gui&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 December. 1561.</NOTE> The Queen-mother was
appointed regent to her &s;on Charles the ninth, now in
his minority: The King of Navarre was named lieu|tenant-general

court: And the family of Gui&s;e, tho' they &s;till enjoyed
great offices, and great power, now found a counter|poi&s;e
to their authority.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was not di&s;&s;atisfied to learn, that her
avowed enemies had met with &s;o &s;evere a check, and &s;he
determined to make advantage of it again&s;t the Queen
of Scots, whom &s;he &s;till regarded as a dangerous rival.
She &s;aw her&s;elf freed from the perils attending an uni|on
of Scotland with France; and was plea&s;ed to find,
that &s;o powerful a prince as the French monarch was
no longer a pretender to her crown and kingdom. But
&s;he con&s;idered, on the other hand, that the Engli&s;h ca|tholics,
who were very numerous, and who were gene|rally
prejudiced in favour of Mary's title, would now
<PB N="44" REF="53">
adhere to that prince&s;s with more zealous attachment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1561.</NOTE>
when they &s;aw, that her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion no longer endanger|ed
the liberties of the kingdom, and was rather attended
with the advantages of producing an entire union with
Scotland. She gave orders, therefore, to her amba&s;&s;a|dor,
Throcmorton, a very vigilant and able mini&s;ter, to
renew his applications to the Queen of Scots, and to
require her ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh. But
tho' Mary had de&s;i&s;ted, after her hu&s;band's death, from
bearing the arms and title of Queen of England, &s;he &s;till
declined gratifying Elizabeth in this momentous arti|cle;
and hearkening too much to the ambitious &s;ug|ge&s;tions
of her uncles, &s;he refu&s;ed to make any formal
renunciation of her preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Queen-mother of France, who
imputed to Mary all the mortifications which &s;he had
met with during Francis's life-time, took care to retali|ate
on her by like injuries; and the Queen of Scots,
who foun$ her abode in France di&s;agreeable, began
to think of returning into her native country. Lord
James, who had been &s;ent in deputation from the &s;tates
to invite her over, &s;econded this intention; and &s;he ap|plied
to Elizabeth, by D'Oi&s;el, for liberty to pa&s;s thro'
England<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. I. p. 175.</NOTE>. But &s;he received for an&s;wer, that till &s;he
had given &s;atisfaction, by ratifying the treaty of Edin|burgh,
&s;he could expect no favour from a per&s;on whom
&s;he had &s;o much injured. This denial excited her re|&s;entment;
and &s;he made no &s;cruple of expre&s;&s;ing her &s;en|timents
to Throcmorton, when he reiterated his ap|plications
to gratify his mi&s;tre&s;s in a demand, which he
repre&s;ented as &s;o rea&s;onable. Having cleared the room
of all her attendants, &s;he &s;aid to him, &startq;How weak I
&startq;may prove, or how far a woman's frailty may tran&s;|port
me, I cannot tell: However, I have no mind to
have &s;o many witne&s;&s;es of my infirmity as you mi&s;|tre&s;s
<PB N="45" REF="54">
had at her audience of my amba&s;&s;ador D'Oi|&s;el.
There is nothing di&s;turbs me &s;o much, as the
having a&s;ked, with &s;o much importunity, a favour
which it was of no con&s;equence for me to obtain. I
can, with God's leave, return to my own country
without her leave; as I came to France, in &s;pite of
all the oppo&s;ition of her brother, King Edward:
Neither do I want friends, both able and willing to
conduct me home, as they have brought me hither;
tho' I was de&s;irous rather to make an experiment of
her friend&s;hip than of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other per|&s;on.
I have often heard you &s;ay, that a good cor|re&s;pondence
between her and my&s;elf would conduce
much to the &s;ecurity and happine&s;s of both our king|doms:
But were &s;he well convinced of this truth,
&s;he had hardly denied me &s;o &s;mall a reque&s;t. But,
perhaps, &s;he bears a better inclination to my rebel|lious
&s;ubjects than to me, their &s;overeing, her equal
in royal dignity, her near relation, and the undoubt|ted
heir of her kingdoms. Be&s;ides her friend&s;hip, I
a&s;k nothing at her hands: I neither trouble her, nor
concern my&s;elf in the affairs of her State: Not that
I am ignorant, that there are now in England a great
many malecontents, who are no friends to the pre|&s;ent
e&s;tabli&s;hment. She is plea&s;ed to upbraid me as a
per&s;on little experienced in the world: I freely own
it; but age will cure that defect. However, I am
old enough to acquit my&s;elf hone&s;tly and courteou&s;ly
to my friends and relations, and to encourage no re|ports
of her, which would mi&s;become a Queen and
her kin&s;woman. I would al&s;o &s;ay, by her leave,
that I am a Queen as well as &s;he, and not altogether
friendle&s;s: And, perhaps, I have as great a &s;oul too;
&s;o that methinks we &s;hould be upon a level in
our treatment of each other. As &s;oon as I have
<PB N="46" REF="55">
con&s;ulted the &s;tates of my kingdom, I &s;hall be ready
to give a rea&s;onable an&s;wer; and I am the more in|tent
on my journey, in order to make the quicker
di&s;patch in this affair. But &s;he, it &s;eems, intends to
&s;top my journey; &s;o that either &s;he will not let me
give her &s;atisfaction, or is re&s;olved not to be &s;atified;
perhaps, on purpo&s;e to keep up the di&s;agreement be|twixt
us. She had often reproached me with my be|ing
young; and I mu&s;t be very young, indeed, and
as ill advi&s;ed, to treat of matters of &s;uch great concern
and importance, without the advice of my Parlia|ment.
I have not been wanting in any friendly
offices to her; but &s;he di&s;believes or overlooks them.
I could heartily wi&s;h, that I was as near allied to
her in affection as in blood: For that, indeed, would
be a mo&s;t valuable alliance<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Caballa, p. 374. Spot&s;wood, p. 177.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>SUCH a &s;pirited reply, notwith&s;tanding the obliging
terms inter&s;per&s;ed in it, was but ill fitted to conciliate
friend&s;hip between the&s;e rival prince&s;&s;es, or cure tho&s;e
mutual jealou&s;ies which had already taken place. Eli|zabeth
equipped a fleet, on pretence of pur&s;uing py|rates,
but probably with an intention of intercepting the
Queen of Scots in her return homewards. Mary em|barked
at Calais;<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th Augu&s;t.</NOTE> and pa&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h fleet in a fog,
arrived &s;afely at Leith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival of Mary in Scotland.</NOTE> attended by her three uncles,
the duke of Aumale, the grand prior, and the marque&s;s
of Elbeuf, together with the marque&s;s of Damville, and
other French courtiers. This change of abode and &s;i|tuation
was very little agreeable to that prince&s;s. Be|&s;ides
the natural prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of a country
in which &s;he had been educated from her earlie&s;t infan|cy,
and where &s;he had borne &s;o high a rank, &s;he could
not forbe$$ regreting her departure from among that
people, &s;o celebrated for their humane and &s;ociable di&s;|po&s;ition,
<PB N="47" REF="56">
and their re&s;pect&s;ul attachment to their &s;o|vereign,
and reflecting on the di&s;parity of the &s;cene
which lay before her. It is &s;aid, tat after &s;he was em|barked
at Calais, &s;he kept her eyes fixed on the coa&s;t of
France, and never turned them from that beloved ob|ject,
till darkne&s;s fell, and intercepted it from her view.
She then ordered a couch to be &s;pread for her under the
open air; and charged the pilot, that, if in the morning
the land was &s;till in &s;ight, he &s;hould awake her, and afford
her one parting view of that country in which all her
affections were centered. The weather proved very
calm, &s;o that the &s;hip made little way in the night-time:
And Mary had once more an opportunity of &s;eeing the
French coa&s;t. She &s;at up on her couch, and &s;till look|ing
towards the land, often repeated the&s;e words:
&startq;Farewell, France, farewell; I &s;hall never &s;ee thee
more<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 179. Jebb, vol. II. p. 483.</NOTE>.&endq; The fir&s;t a&s;pect, however, of things in Scot|land,
was more favourable, if not to her plea&s;ure and
happine&s;s, at lea&s;t to her repo&s;e and &s;ecurity, than &s;he
had rea&s;on to apprehend. No &s;ooner did the French
gallies appear off Leith, than people of all ranks, who
had long expected their arrival, flocked towards the
&s;hore, with an earne&s;t impatience to behold and receive
their young &s;overeign. Some were led by duty, &s;ome
by intere&s;t, &s;ome by curio&s;ity; and all combined to ex|pre&s;s
their attachment to her, and to in&s;inuate them|&s;elves
into her confidence, on the commencement of
her admini&s;tration. She had now reached the nine|teenth
year of her age; and the bloom of her youth, and
amiable beauty of her per&s;on, were farther recommend|ed
by the affability of her addre&s;s, the politene&s;s of her
manners, and the elegance of her genius. Well ac|compli&s;hed
in all the &s;uperficial, but engaging graces
of a court, &s;he afforded, when better known, &s;till more
<PB N="48" REF="57">
promi&s;ing indications of her character; and men prog|no&s;ticated
both humanity from her &s;oft and obliging de|portment,
and penetration from her ta&s;te in all the refi|ned
arts of mu&s;ic, eloquence, and poetry<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Buchan, lib. xvii. c. 9. Spot&s;wood, p. 178, 179. Keith, p. 180. Thuan. lib. xxix. c. 2.</NOTE>. And as the
Scots had long been deprived of the pre&s;ence of their &s;o|vereign,
whom they once de&s;paired ever more to behold
among them, her arrival &s;eemed to give univer&s;al &s;atis|faction;
and nothing appeared about the court, but
&s;ymptoms of affection, joy, and fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t mea&s;ures which Mary embraced, confirmed
all the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which had been entertained in her
favour. She followed the advice which &s;he had receiv|ed
in France from D'Oi&s;el and the bi&s;hop of Ami|ens,
as well as her uncles; and gave her confidence en|tirely
to the leaders of the reformed party, who had
greate&s;t influence on the people, and who, &s;he found,
were alone able to &s;upport her government. Her bro|ther,
lord James, whom &s;he &s;oon after created earl of
Murray, obtained the chief authority; and after him,
Lidington, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, a man of great &s;agacity,
$word$ a principal &s;hare in her confidence. By the vigour
of the&s;e mens mea&s;ures &s;he endeavoured to re&s;tore or|der
and police in the country, divided by public fac|tions
and private feuds; and that fierce and intractable
people, unacquainted with laws and obedience, &s;eemed,
for a time, to &s;ubmit peaceably to her gentle and pru|dent
admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>BUT there was one circum&s;tance which bla&s;ted all
the&s;e promi&s;ing appearances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bigotry of the Scots reformers.</NOTE> and bereaved Mary of
that general favour which her agreeable manners and
prudent deportment gave her ju&s;t rea&s;on to expect. She
was &s;till a papi&s;t; and tho' &s;he publi&s;hed, &s;oon after her
arrival, a proclamation, requiring every one to &s;ubmit
<PB N="49" REF="58">
to &s;ubmit to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, the preachers, and
their adherents, could neither be reconciled to a per|&s;on
polluted with &s;o great an abomination, nor lay a&s;ide
their jealou&s;ies of her future conduct. It was with
great difficulty &s;he could obtain permi&s;&s;ion for ma&s;s in
her own chappel; and had not the people apprehend|ed,
that if &s;he had here met with a refu&s;al, &s;he would
in&s;tantly have returned to France, the zealots never
would have granted her even that &s;mall indulgence.
The cry was, &startq;Shall that idol be &s;uffered again to be
erected within the realm?&endq; It was a&s;&s;erted in the pul|pit,
that one ma&s;s was more terrible than ten thou&s;and

One that carried tapers for the ceremony of
that wor&s;hip, was attacked and in&s;ulted in the court of
the palace. And if the lord James, and &s;ome popular
leaders, had not interpo&s;ed, the mo&s;t dangerous uproar
was ju&s;tly apprehended, from the ungoverned fury of
the multitude<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 284, 285, 287. Spot&s;wood, p. 179.</NOTE>. The u&s;ual prayers in the churches
were to this purpo&s;e: That God would turn her heart,
which was ob&s;tinate again&s;t him and his truth; or if
his holy will be otherwi&s;e, that he would &s;trengthen the
hearts and <HI>hands</HI> of the elect, &s;toutly to oppo&s;e the rage
of all tyrants<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 179.</NOTE>. Nay, it was openly called in que|&s;tion,
whether that prince&s;s, being an idolatre&s;s, was
entitled to any authority, even in civil matters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 202.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The helple&s;s Queen was every moment expo&s;ed to
contumely, which &s;he bore with benignity and pati|ence.
Soon after her arrival &s;he dined in the ca&s;tle of
Edinburgh; and it was there contrived, that a boy,
&s;ix years of age &s;hould be let down from the roof, and
&s;hould pre&s;ent her with a bible, a p&s;alter, and the keys
<PB N="50" REF="59">
of the ca&s;tle. Le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be at a lo&s;s to under|&s;tand
this in&s;ult on her as a papi&s;t, all the decorations

and other puni&s;hments inflicted by God again&s;t idola|try<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 189. Buchan. lib. xvii. c. 20.</NOTE>. The town council of Edinburgh had the a&s;&s;u|rance,

have inferred, that the Queen was engaged, by a &s;ym|pathy
of manners, to take adulterers and fornicators
under her protection. It appears probable, that the
magi&s;trates were afterwards rein&s;tated in their office,
and that their proclamation was confirmed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 202.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT all the in&s;olence of the people was nothing in
compari&s;on of that which was exerci&s;ed by the clergy
and the preachers; and they took a pride in vilifying,
even to her face, this amiable prince&s;s. The a&s;&s;embly
of the church framed an addre&s;s, in which, after tel|ling
her, that her ma&s;s was a ba&s;tard &s;ervice of God, the
fountain of all impiety, and the &s;ource of every evil
which abounded in the realm; they di&s;covered their ex|pectations,
that &s;he would, ere this time, have prefer|ed
truth to her own pre-conceived opinion, and have
renounced her religion, which, they a&s;&s;ured her, was
nothing but abomination and vanity. They &s;aid, that the
pre&s;ent abu&s;es of government were &s;o enormous, that if a
&s;peedy remedy was not provided, God would not fail in
his anger to &s;trike the head and the tail, the di&s;obedient
prince and &s;inful people. They required, that &s;evere
puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted on adulterers and forni|cators;

and they concluded with demanding for them|&s;elves,
&s;ome addition both of power and property<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 311, 312.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE ringleader in all the&s;e in&s;ults on maje&s;ty was
John Knox, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncontrouled authority
in the church, and even in the civil affairs of the nati|on,

conde&s;cen&s;ion, to win his favour, all her in&s;inua|tions
could gain nothing on his obdurate heart. She
promi&s;ed him acce&s;s to her whenever he demanded it;
and &s;he even de&s;ired him, if he found her blameable in
any thing, to reprehend her freely in private, rather
than vilify her in the pulpit before all the people;
but he plainly told her, that he had a publick mi|ni&s;try
entru&s;ted to him, that if &s;he would come to
church, &s;he &s;hould there hear the go&s;pel of truth, and
that it was not his bu&s;ine&s;s to apply to every in|dividual,
nor had he lei&s;ure for that occupation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 310.</NOTE>.
The political principles of the man, which he com|municated
to his brethren, were as full of &s;edition as
his theological were of rage and bigotry. Tho' he
once conde&s;cended &s;o far as to tell the Queen, that
he would &s;ubmit to her, in the &s;ame manner that Paul
did to Nero<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 288.</NOTE>; he remained not long in this dutiful
&s;train. He &s;aid to her, that &startq;Samuel feared not to &s;lay
Agag, the fat and delicate King of Amalek, whom
King Saul had &s;aved: Neither &s;pared Elias Jezabel's
fal&s;e prophets, and Baal's prie&s;ts, tho' King Ahab was
pre&s;ent. Phineas,&endq; added he, &startq;was no magi&s;trate;
and yet feared he not to &s;trike Co&s;bie and Zimri in
the very act of filthy fornication. And &s;o, madam,
your grace may &s;ee, that others than chief magi&s;trates
may lawfully inflict puni&s;hment on &s;uch crimes as

are condemned by the law of God<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 326.</NOTE>.&endq; Knox had for|merly,
during the reign of Mary of England, wrote a

of it is, <HI>The fir&s;t bla&s;t of the trumpet again&s;t the mon|&s;trous

recant the tenets of this book, or even to apologize for
them; and his conduct &s;hewed, that he thought no
more civility than loyalty was due to any of the female
&s;ex.</P>
<P>THE whole life of Mary, from the demeanour of
the&s;e men, was filled with bitterne&s;s and &s;orrow. This
ru&s;tic apo&s;tle &s;cruples not, in his hi&s;tory, to inform us,
that he once treated her with &s;uch &s;everity, that &s;he
lo&s;t all command of her temper, and di&s;&s;olved into tears
before him: Yet &s;o far from being moved with youth,
and beauty, and royal dignity reduced to that conditi|on,
he per&s;evered in his in&s;olent reproofs; and when
he relates this incident, he even di&s;covers a vi&s;ible pride
and &s;atisfaction in his own conduct<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 332, 333.</NOTE>. The pulpits
had become nothing but &s;cenes of railing again&s;t the vi|ces
of the court; among which were always noted as
the principal, fea&s;ting, finery, dancing, balls, and
whoredom, their nece&s;&s;ary attendant<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 322.</NOTE>. Some orna|ments,
which the ladies at that time wore upon their
petticoats, excited mightily the indignation of the
preachers, and they affirmed, that &s;uch vanity would pro|voke
God's vengeance, not only again&s;t the&s;e fooli&s;h
women, but again&s;t the whole realm<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 330.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MARY, who&s;e age, condition, and education invited her
to liberty and chearfulne&s;s, was curbed in every amu&s;e|ment,
by the ab&s;urd &s;everity of the&s;e reformers; and &s;he
found each moment rea&s;on to regret her leaving that coun|try
from who&s;e manners &s;he had in her early youth recei|ved
the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 294.</NOTE>. Her two uncles, the duke
<PB N="53" REF="62">
of Aumale, and the grand prior, with the other French
nobility, &s;oon took their leave of her: The marque&s;s of
Elbeuf remained &s;ome time longer; but after his depar|ture,
&s;he was left alone to the &s;ociety of her own &s;ub|jects;
men at that time unacquainted with the plea|&s;ures
of conver&s;ation, ignorant of arts and civility, and
corrupted beyond their u&s;ual ru&s;ticity by a di&s;mal fana|t$$i&s;m,
which rendered them incapable of all humanity
or improvement. Tho' &s;he had made no attempt to
re&s;tore the antient religion, her popery was a &s;ufficient
crime: Tho' her behaviour was hitherto irreproacha|ble,
and her manners &s;weet and engaging, her gaiety
and ea&s;e were interpreted as &s;igns of di&s;&s;olute vanity.
And to the har&s;h and prepo&s;terous u&s;age which this prin|ce&s;s
met with, may, in part, be a&s;cribed tho&s;e errors of
her &s;ub&s;equent conduct, which &s;eemed to be &s;o little
of a piece with the general tenor of her character.</P>
<P>THERE happened to the marque&s;s of Elbeuf, before
his departure, an adventure which, tho' frivolous, might
enable him to give Mary's friends in France, a very
melancholy idea of her &s;ituation. This nobleman,
with the earl of Bothwel, and &s;ome other young cour|tiers,
had been engaged, after a debauch to pay a vi&s;it
to a woman called Ali&s;on Craig, who was known to be
liberal of her favours; and becau&s;e they were denied en|trance,
they broke the windows, thru&s;t open the door,
and committed &s;ome di&s;orders, in &s;earching for the
dam&s;el. It happened that the a&s;&s;embly of the church
was &s;itting at that time, and they immediately took
the matter under their cognizance. In conjunction
with &s;everal of the nobility, they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s
to the Queen, which was introduced with this awful
prelude. &startq;To the Queen's maje&s;ty, and to her &s;ecret
and great council, her grace's faithful and obedient
&s;ubjects, the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;t Je&s;us's holy evangil,
<PB N="54" REF="63">
with the &s;pirit of righteous judgment.&endq; The tenor
of the petition was, that the fear of God, the duty
which they owed her grace, and the terrible threatnings
denounced by God again&s;t every city or country where
horrible crimes are openly committed, compelled them
to demand the &s;evere puni&s;hment of &s;uch as had done
what in them lay to kindle the wrath of God again&s;t
the whole realm: That the inquity of which they com|plained,
was &s;o heinous, and &s;o horrible, that they
&s;hould e&s;teem them&s;elves accomplices in it, if they had
been engaged by worldly fear, or &s;ervile complai&s;ance,
to pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence, or bury it in oblivion: That
as they owed her grace obedience in the admini&s;tration
of ju&s;tice, &s;o were they entitled to require of her, in
return, the &s;harp and condign puni&s;hment of this enor|mity,
which, they repeated it, might draw down the
vengeance of God on the whole kingdom: And that
they in&s;i&s;ted on it to be her duty to lay a&s;ide all private
affections towards the actors in this heinous crime and
enormous villainy, and without delay bring them to a
trial, and inflict the &s;evere&s;t penalties upon them. The
Queen gave a gracious reception to this peremptory ad|addre&s;s;
but becau&s;e &s;he probably thought, that break|ing
the windows of a brothel merited not &s;uch &s;evere
reprehen&s;ion, &s;he only replied, that her uncle was a
&s;tranger, and that he was attended with a young com|pany:
But &s;he would put &s;uch order to him and to all
others, that her &s;ubjects &s;hould henceforth have no rea|&s;on
to complain. Her pa&s;&s;ing over this incident &s;o
&s;lightly, was the &s;ource of great di&s;content, and was re|garded
as a proof of the mo&s;t pro&s;tigate manners<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 302, 303, 304. Keith, p. 509.</NOTE>. It
is not to be omitted, that Ali&s;on Craig, the cau&s;e of all
the uproar, was known to entertain a commerce with
the earl of Arran, who, on account of his great zeal
<PB N="55" REF="64">
for the reformation, was, without &s;cruple, indulged in
that enormity<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Knox. Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME of the populace of Edinburgh broke into the
Queen's chappel during her ab&s;ence, and committed
&s;ome outrages; for which two of them were indicted,
and it was intended to bring them to a trial. Knox
wrote circular letters to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable zealots
of the party, and charged them to appear in town, and
protect their brethren. The holy &s;acraments, he there
&s;aid, are abu&s;ed by prophane papi&s;ts; the ma&s;s has been
&s;aid; and in wor&s;hiping that idol, the prie&s;ts have omit|ted
no ceremony, not even the conjuring of their ac|cur&s;ed
water, that had ever been practi&s;ed in the time
of the greate&s;t blindne&s;s. The&s;e violent mea&s;ures for
oppo&s;ing ju&s;tice differed little from rebellion; and Knox
was &s;ummoned before the council to an&s;wer for his
offence. The courage of this man was equal to his
in&s;olence. He &s;crupled not to tell the Queen, that
the pe&s;tilent papi&s;ts, who had enflamed her again&s;t the&s;e
holy men, were the &s;ons of the devil; and mu&s;t there|fore
obey the directions of their father, who had been a
liar and a man&s;layer from the beginning. The mat|ter
ended with the full acquital of Knox<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 336, 342.</NOTE>. Randolf,
the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador in Scotland at this time, had
rea&s;on to write to Cecil, &s;peaking of the Scots nation:
&startq;I think marvelou&s;ly of the wi&s;dom of God, that gave
this unruly, incon&s;tant, and cumber&s;ome people no
more power nor &s;ub&s;tance: For they would other|wi&s;e
run wild<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 202.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>WE have related the&s;e circum&s;tances at greater
length, than the nece&s;&s;ity of our &s;ubject may &s;eem to re|quire:
But even trivial incidents, which &s;how the man|ners
of the age, are often more in&s;tructive, as well as
entertaining, than the great tran&s;actions of wars and
<PB N="56" REF="65">
negotiations, which are nearly &s;imilar in all periods and
and in all countries of the world.</P>
<P>THE reformed clergy in Scotland had, at that time,
a very natural rea&s;on for their ill humour, viz. the po|verty
or rather beggary to which they were reduced:
The nobility and gentry had at fir&s;t laid their hands
on all the property of the regular clergy, without ma|king
any provi&s;ion for the friars and nuns, whom they
turned out of all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The &s;ecular cler|gy
of the catholic communion, tho' they lo&s;t all eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
juri&s;diction, &s;till held &s;ome of the temporalities
of their benefices; and either became laymen them&s;elves,
and converted them into perpetual property, or made
conveyance of them at low prices to the nobility, who
thus enriched them&s;elves by the plunder of the church.
The new teachers had hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted chiefly by the
voluntary oblations of the faithful; and in a poor coun|try,
divided in religious &s;entiments, this e&s;tabli&s;hment
was regarded as very &s;canty and very precarious. Re|peated
applications were made for a legal &s;ettlement
to the preachers; and tho' almo&s;t every thing in the
kingdom was governed by their zeal and caprice, it was
with difficulty that their reque&s;t was at la&s;t complied
with. The fanatical &s;pirit which they indulged, and
their indu&s;try in decrying the principles and practices
of the romi&s;h communion, which placed &s;uch a merit
in enriching the clergy, proved now a very &s;en&s;ible ob|&s;tacle
to their acqui&s;itions. The boundaries of the roy|al
power were, during that age, more uncertain in
Scotland than even in England; and the privy coun|cil
alone thought them&s;elves intitled, without a Parlia|ment,
to regulate this important matter. They pa&s;&s;ed
a vote<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 296. Keith, p. 210.</NOTE>, by which they divided all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical be|nefices
into twenty one parts: They a&s;&s;igned fourteen
to the antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors: Of the remaining &s;even, they
<PB N="57" REF="66">
granted three to the crown; and if that was &s;ound to
an&s;wer the public expences, they be&s;towed the over|plus
on the reformed mini&s;ters. The Queen was em|powered
to levy all the &s;even; and it was ordained,
that &s;he &s;hould afterwards pay to the clergy what &s;hould
be judged to &s;uffice for their maintenance. The ne|ce&s;&s;ities
of the crown, the rapacity of the courtiers, and
the &s;mall affection which Mary bore to the proto|&s;tant
eccle&s;ia&s;tics, rendered their revenues very con|temptible
as well as uncertain; and the preachers, find|ing
that they could not rival the gentry, nor even the
middling rank of men in opulence and plenty, were
nece&s;&s;itated to betake them&s;elves to other expedients for
&s;upporting their authority. They affected a furious
zeal for religion, moro&s;e manners, a vulgar and famili|ar,
and yet my&s;terious, cant; and tho' the liberality of
&s;ub&s;equent princes put them afterwards on a better
footing with regard to revenue and thereby corrected
in &s;ome degree the&s;e vicious habits; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed
that, while many other advantages attend pre&s;byterian
government, the&s;e inconveniencies are not ea&s;ily &s;epa|rated
from the genius of that eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots, de&s;titute of all force, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
a narrow revenue, &s;urrounded with a factious turbu|lent
nobility, a bigoted people, and in&s;olent eccle&s;ia&s;|tics,
&s;oon found, that her only expedient fot maintain|ing
tranquillity was to pre&s;erve a good corre&s;pondence
with<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 456.</NOTE> Elizabeth, who by former engagements and &s;er|vices,
had acquired &s;uch authority over all the&s;e ranks
of men. Soon after her arrival in Scotland, &s;ecretary
Lidington was &s;ent to London, in order to pay her
compliments to the Queen, and expre&s;s her de&s;ire of
friend&s;hip and a good corre&s;pondence; and he received
a commi&s;&s;ion from her, as well as from the Scots
nobility, to demand, as a means of cementing this
<PB N="58" REF="67">
friend&s;hip, that Mary &s;hould, by act of Parliament or
by Proclamation (for the difference between the&s;e &s;e|curities
was not then deemed very con&s;iderable) be de|clared
&s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown. No reque&s;t could be
more unrea&s;onable, nor made at a more improper
juncture. The Queen replied, that Mary had once
di&s;covered her intention not to wait for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
but had openly, without ceremony or re&s;erve, a&s;&s;umed
the title of Queen of England, and had pretended &s;upe|rior
right to her throne and kingdom: That tho' her
amba&s;&s;adors, and tho&s;e of her hu&s;band, the French King,
had &s;igned a treaty, in which they renounced that claim,
and promi&s;ed &s;atisfaction for &s;o great an indignity, &s;he
was &s;o intoxicated with this imaginary right, that &s;he
had rejected the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;ollicitations, and even, as
&s;ome endeavoured to per&s;uade her, incurred &s;ome dan|ger
in cro&s;&s;ing the &s;eas rather than ratify that equita|ble
treaty: That her partizans every where had &s;till
the a&s;&s;urance to in&s;i&s;t on her title, and had pre&s;umed to
talk of her own birth as &s;purious and illegitimate: That
while affairs were on this footing; while a claim thus
openly made, &s;o far from being openly renounced, was
only &s;u&s;pended till a more convenient opportunity; it
would in her be the mo&s;t egregious imprudence to for|tify
the hands of a pretender to her crown, by decla|ring
her the &s;ucce&s;&s;or: That no expedient could be
wor&s;e imagined for cementing friend&s;hip than &s;uch a
declaration, and Kings were often found to bear no
good will to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, even tho' their own chil|dren;
much more when the connexion was &s;o much le&s;s
intimate, and when &s;uch cau&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t and jealou&s;y
had been already given, and indeed was &s;till continued,
on the part of Mary: That tho' &s;he was willing, from
the amity which &s;he bore her kin&s;woman, to a&s;cribe
her former preten&s;ions to the advice of others, by who&s;e
<PB N="59" REF="68">
direction &s;he was then governed; her refu&s;al to relin|qui&s;h
them could proceed only from her own prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons,
and were a proof that &s;he &s;till retained &s;ome dan|gerous
project again&s;t her: That it was the nature of
all men to be di&s;gu&s;ted with the pre&s;ent, to entertain
flattering views of futurity, to think their &s;ervices ill
rewarded, to expect a better recompence from the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or;
and &s;he &s;hould e&s;teem her&s;elf &s;carce half a &s;ove|reign
over the Engli&s;h, if they &s;aw her declare her heir,
and arm her rival with authority again&s;t her own re|po&s;e
and &s;afety: That &s;he knew the incon&s;tant nature
of the people; &s;he was acquainted with the pre&s;ent di|vi&s;ions
in religion; &s;he was not ignorant, that the &s;ame
party, which expected greate&s;t favour during the reign
of Mary, did al&s;o imagine, that the title of that prince&s;s
was &s;uperior to her own: That for her part, whatever
claims were advanced, &s;he was determined to live and
die Queen of England; and after her death, it was the
bu&s;ine&s;s of others to examine who had the be&s;t preten|&s;ions,
either by the laws or by right of blood, to the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion: That &s;he hoped the Queen of Scots's claim
would then be found preferable; and con&s;idering the
injury, which &s;he her&s;elf had received, it was &s;uffici|ent
indulgence, if &s;he promi&s;ed, in the mean time, to
do nothing which might, in any re&s;pect, weaken or in|validate
that claim: And that Mary, if her title was re|ally
&s;uperior, a point, which, for her own part, &s;he had
never inquired into, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all advantages above her
rivals; who, de&s;titute both of pre&s;ent power, and of all
&s;upport by friends, would only expo&s;e them&s;elves to
inevitable ruin, by advancing any weak, or even doubt|ful
preten&s;ions<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Buchanan. lib. xvii. c. 14&mdash;17. Camden. p. 385. Spot&s;wood, p. 180. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE views of the Queen were &s;o prudent and ju|dicious,
that there was no likelihood of her ever de|parting
<PB N="60" REF="69">
from them: But that &s;he might put the matter
to a fuller proof, &s;he offered to explain the words of
the treaty of Edinburgh, &s;o as to leave no &s;u&s;picion on
their excluding Mary's right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 181.</NOTE>; and in this
form, &s;he again required her to ratify that treaty. Mat|ters
at la&s;t came to this i&s;&s;ue, that Mary agreed to the
propo&s;al, and offered to renounce all pre&s;ent preten&s;i|ons
to the crown of England, provided Elizabeth would
agree to declare her the &s;ucce&s;&s;or<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I. p. 377.</NOTE>. But &s;uch was the
jealous character of this latter prince&s;s, that &s;he never
would con&s;ent to &s;trengthen the intere&s;t and authority of
any claimant, by fixing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; much le&s;s would
&s;he make this conce&s;&s;ion in favour of a rival Queen,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch plau&s;ible preten&s;ions for the pre&s;ent,
and who, tho' &s;he might verbally re&s;ign them, could
eal&s;iy re&s;ume her title on the fir&s;t opportunity. Ma|ry's
propo&s;al, however, bore &s;o &s;pecious an appearance
of equity and ju&s;tice, that Elizabeth, &s;en&s;ible that rea|&s;on
would be deemed to lie entirely on that &s;ide, made
no more mention of the matter; and tho' no farther
conce&s;&s;ions were made by either Prince&s;s, they put on
all the appearances of a cordial reconcilement and
friend&s;hip with each other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wi&s;e go|vernment of Elizabeth.</NOTE> The Queen ob&s;erved, that,
even without her interpo&s;ition, Mary was &s;ufficiently
depre&s;&s;ed by the mutinous di&s;po&s;ition of her own &s;ub|jects;
and in&s;tead of giving Scotland, for the pre&s;ent,
any inquietude or di&s;turbance, &s;he employed her&s;elf,
much more u&s;efully and laudibly, in regulating the af|fairs
of her own kingdom, and promoting the happine&s;s
of her people. She made &s;ome progre&s;s in paying tho&s;e
great $$debtd which lay upon the crown; &s;he regulated
the coin, which had been extremely deba&s;ed by her
predece&s;&s;ors; &s;he furni&s;hed her ar&s;enals with great
quantities of arms from Germany and other places; en|gaged

her nobility and gentry to imitate her example
in this particular; introduced into the kingdom the

her frontiers on the &s;ide of Scotland; made frequent re|views

<P>IT is ea&s;y to imagine, that &s;o great a prince&s;s, who
enjoyed &s;uch felicity and renown, would receive propo|&s;als
of marriage from every one, who had any likelihood

account, better intitled to &s;ucceed in his addre&s;&s;es. Eric,
King of Sweden, and Adolph, duke of Hol&s;tein, were
encouraged by the &s;ame views to become &s;uitors; and
the earl of Arran, heir to the crown of Scotland, was,
by the &s;tates of that kingdom, recommended to her
as a &s;uitable marriage. Even &s;ome of her own &s;ubjects,
tho' they did not openly declare their preten&s;ions, en|tertained
<PB N="62" REF="71">
hopes of &s;ucce&s;s.. The earl of Arundel, a per|&s;on
declining in years, but de&s;cended from a very anti|ent
and noble family, as well as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great ri|ches,
flattered him&s;elf with this pro&s;pect; as did al&s;o Sir
William Pickering, a man much e&s;teemed for his per|&s;onal
merit. But the per&s;on mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed,
was a younger &s;on of the late duke of Northumberland,
the lord Robert Dudley, who, by means of his exterior
qualities, joined to addre&s;s and flattery, had become, in
a manner, her declared favourite, and had great influ|ence
in all her councils. The le&s;s worthy he appeared
of this di&s;tinction, the more was his great favour a&s;cri|bed
to &s;ome violent affection, which could thus &s;educe
the judgment of this penetrating prince&s;s; and men long
expected, that he would obtain the preference above &s;o
many princes and monarchs. But the Queen gave all
the&s;e &s;uitors a gentle refu&s;al, which &s;till encouraged
their pur&s;uit; and &s;he thought, that &s;he &s;hould the
better attach them to her intere&s;ts, if they were &s;till
allowed to entertain hopes of &s;ucceeding in their pre|ten&s;ions.
It is al&s;o probable, that this policy was not
entirely free from a mixture of female coquetry; and
that, tho' &s;he was determined in her own mind never
to &s;hare her power with any man, &s;he was not di&s;plea|&s;ed
with the court&s;hip, &s;ollicitation, and profe&s;&s;ions $word$
love, which the de&s;ire of acquiring &s;o valuable a prize,
procured her from all quarters.</P>
<P>WHAT is mo&s;t &s;ingular in the conduct and character
of Elizabeth, is, that, tho' &s;he determined never $word$
have any heir of her own body, &s;he was not only ex|tremely
aver&s;e to fix any &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown; b$
&s;eems al&s;o to have re&s;olved, as far as lay in her power
that no one, who had preten&s;ions to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
&s;hould ever have any heirs of &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. After the $word$
clu&s;ion given by the will of Henry VIII. to the po&s;teri
of Margaret, Queen of Scotland, the right to the cro$
<PB N="63" REF="72">
devolved on the hou&s;e of Suffolk; and the lady Ca|therine
Gray, younger &s;i&s;ter to the lady Jane, was now
the heir of that family. This lady had been married
to the lord Herbert, fon to the earl of Pembroke; but
having been divorced from that nobleman, &s;he had
made a private marriage with the earl of Hertford, &s;on
to the protector; and her hu&s;band, &s;oon after con&s;um|mation,
travelled into France. In a little time &s;he ap|peared
to be pregnant, which &s;o enraged Elizabeth,
that &s;he threw her into the Tower, and &s;ummoned him
to appear, in order to an&s;wer for his mi&s;demeanor. He
made no &s;cruple to acknowlege the marriage, which,
tho' concluded without the Queen's con&s;ent, was intire|ly
&s;uitable to both parties; and for this offence he was
al&s;o committed to the Tower. Elizabeth's &s;everity
&s;topped not here: She i&s;&s;ued a commi&s;&s;ion to enquire
into the matter; and as Hertford could not, within the
time limited, prove the nuptials by witne&s;&s;es, their
commerce was declared unlawful, and their po&s;terity
illegitimate. They were &s;till continued in cu&s;tody;
but by bribing their keepers, they found means to have
farther intercour&s;e; and another child appeared to be
the fruit of their commerce. This was a fre&s;h &s;ource
of vexation to the Queen who made a fine of fifteen
thou&s;and pounds be &s;et on Hertford by the Star-Cham|ber,
and ordered his con$nement to be thenceforth &s;till
more rigid and &s;evere. He lay in this condition for nine
years, till the death of his wife, by freeing Elizabeth
from all fears, procured him his liberty<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I. p. 369, 378, 396. Camden, p. 389. Heylin, p. 154.</NOTE>. This extreme
&s;everity mu&s;t be accounted for, either by the unrelent|ing
jealou&s;y of the Queen, who was afraid that any
pretender to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would acquire credit by
having i&s;&s;ue; or by her malignity, which, with all her
great qualities, made one ingredient in her character,

and which led her to envy in others tho&s;e natural plea|&s;ures
of love and po&s;terity, of which her own ambiti|on
and de&s;ire of dominion made her renounce all pro&s;|pect
for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>THERE happened, about this time, &s;ome other events
in the royal family, where the Queen's conduct was
more laudable. Arthur Pole, and his brother, ne|phews
to the late cardinal, and de&s;cended from the duke
of Clarence, brother to Edward the fourth, together
with Anthony Forte&s;cue, who had married a &s;i&s;ter of
the&s;e gentlemen, and &s;ome other per&s;ons, were brought
to their trial for con&s;piring to withdraw into France,
with a view of receiving &s;uccours from the duke of
Gui&s;e, of returning thence into Wales, and of pro|claiming
Mary Queen of England, and Arthur Pole
duke of Clarence. They confe&s;&s;ed the indictment,
but a&s;&s;erted, that they never intended to execute the&s;e
projects during the Queen's life-time: They had only
deemed &s;uch procautions requi&s;ite in ca&s;e of her death,
which, &s;ome pretenders to judicial a&s;trology had a&s;&s;ured
them, they might with certainty look for before the
year expired. They were condemned by the jury; but
received their pardon from the Queen's clemency<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 333. Heylin, p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>

during the cour&s;e of near forty years, a &s;cene of
horror and deva&s;tation, the great rival powers in Europe
were Spain and England; and it was not long before
an animo&s;ity, fir&s;t political, then per&s;onal, broke out
between the &s;overeigns of the&s;e countries.</P>
<P>PHILIP the &s;econd of Spain, tho' he reached not any
enlarged views of policy, was endowed with great indu|&s;try
and &s;agacity, a remarkable caution in his enter|prizes,
an unu&s;ual fore&s;ight in all his mea&s;ures; and as
he was ever cool and &s;eemingly unmoved by pa&s;&s;ion,
and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither talents nor inclination for war,
both his &s;ubjects and his neighbours had rea&s;on to ex|pect
great ju&s;tice, happine&s;s and tranquillity, from his
admini&s;tration. But prejudices had on him a more
pernicious effect than ever pa&s;&s;ions had on any other
monarch; and the &s;pirit of bigotry and tyranny, by
which he was actuated, with the fraudulent maxims
which governed his councils, excited the mo&s;t violent
<PB N="66" REF="77">
agitation among his own people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XL.</NOTE> engaged him in acts
of the mo&s;t enormous cruelty, and threw all Europe
into combu&s;tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1562.</NOTE></P>
<P>AFTER Philip had concluded peace at Cambray, and
had remained &s;ome time in the Netherlands, in order
to &s;ettle the affairs of that country, he embarked for
Spain; and as the gravity of that nation, with their
re&s;pectful obedience to their prince, had appeared much
more agreeable to his humour, than the homely fa|miliar
manners, and the pertinacious liberty of the Fle|mings,
it was expected, that he would for the future
re&s;ide altogether at Madrid, and would govern all his
exten&s;ive dominions by Spani&s;h mini&s;ters and Spani&s;h
councils. Having met with a violent tempe&s;t on his
voyage, he no &s;ooner arrived in harbour, than he fell
on his knees, and after giving thanks for this delive|rance,
he vowed, that his life, which was thus pro|videntially
&s;aved, &s;hould be thenceforth entirely devoted
to the extirpation of here&s;y<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. xxiii. cap. 14.</NOTE>. His &s;ub&s;equent conduct
corre&s;ponded to the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. Finding that the new
doctrines had penetrated into Spain, he let loo&s;e the rage
of per&s;ecution again&s;t all who profe&s;&s;ed them, or were
&s;u&s;pected of adhering to them; and by his violence he
gave new edge, even to the unrelenting cruelty of
prie&s;ts and inqui&s;itors. He committed to cu&s;tody Con|&s;tantine
Ponce, who had been confe&s;&s;or to his father,
the emperor Charles; who had attended him during
his retreat; and in who&s;e arms that great monarch had
terminated his life: And after this eccle&s;ia&s;tic died in
pri&s;on, he &s;till ordered him to be tried and condemned
for here&s;y, and his &s;tatue to be committed to the flames.
He even deliberated, whether he &s;hould not exerci&s;e
like &s;everity again&s;t the memory of his father, who
was &s;u&s;pected, during his latter years, to have indulged
a propen&s;ity towards the Lutheran principles: In his
<PB N="67" REF="78">
furious zeal for orthodoxy, he &s;pared neither age, &s;ex,
nor condition: He was pre&s;ent, with an inflexible
countenance, at the mo&s;t barbarous executions: He
i&s;&s;ued rigorous orders for the pro&s;ecution of heretics, in
Spain, Italy, the Indies, and the Low Countries: And
having founded his determined tyranny on maxims of
civil policy, as well as on principles of religion, all his
&s;ubjects &s;aw, that there was no method, except the
mo&s;t entire compliance, or mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance,
to e&s;cape or elude the &s;everity of his vengeance.</P>
<P>DURING that extreme animo&s;ity which prevailed be|tween
the adherents of the oppo&s;ite religions, the civil
magi&s;trate, who found it difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible,
for the &s;ame laws to govern &s;uch enraged adver&s;aries,
was naturally led by &s;pecious rules of prudence, in
embracing one party, to dec$are war again&s;t the other,
and to exterminate, by fire and &s;word, tho&s;e bigots,
who, from abhorrence of his religion, had proceeded to
an oppo&s;ition of his power, and to a hatred of his per|&s;on.
If any prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch enlarged views as to
fore&s;ee, that a mutual toleration would in time abate
the fury of religious prejudices, he yet met with diffi|culties
in reducing this principle to practice; and might
deem the malady too violent to await a remedy, which,
tho' certain, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;low in its operations.
But Philip, tho' a profound hypocrite, and extremely
governed by &s;elf-intere&s;t, &s;eems al&s;o to have been him|&s;elf
actuated by an imperious bigotry; and as he em|ployed
great reflection in all his conduct, he could
ea&s;ily palliate the gratification of his natural temper
under the colour of wi&s;dom, and find in this &s;y&s;tem
no le&s;s advantage to his foreign than his dome&s;tic po|litics.
By placing him&s;elf at the head of the catho|lic
party, he converted the zealots of the ancient faith
into partizans of the Spani&s;h greatne&s;s; and by employ|ing
<PB N="68" REF="79">
the powerful allurement of religion, he &s;educed
every where the &s;ubjects from that allegiance which
they owed their native &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE cour&s;e of events, guiding and concurring with
choice, had placed Elizabeth in a &s;ituation diametri|cally
oppo&s;ite; and had rai&s;ed her to be the glory, the
bulwark, and the &s;upport of the numerous, tho' &s;till
per&s;ecuted prote&s;tants, throughout all Europe. More
moderate in her temper than Philip, &s;he found, with
plea&s;ure, that the principles of her &s;ect required not &s;uch
extreme &s;everity in her dome&s;tic government, as was
exerci&s;ed by that monarch; and having no object but
&s;elf-pre&s;ervation, &s;he united her intere&s;ts in all foreign
negociations with tho&s;e who were every where &s;trug|gling
under oppre&s;&s;ion, and guarding them&s;elves again&s;t
ruin and extermination. The more virtuous &s;overeign
was thus happily thrown into the more favourable
cau&s;e; and fortune, in this in&s;tance, concurred with
policy and nature.</P>
<P>DURING the life-time of Henry the &s;econd and his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, the force of the&s;e principles was &s;omewhat
re&s;trained, tho' not altogether overcome, by the mo|tives
of a &s;uperior intere&s;t; and the dread of uniting
England with the French mona$chy, engaged Philip
to maintain a good corre&s;pondence with Elizabeth.
Yet even during this period he rejected the garter which
&s;he &s;ent him; he refu&s;ed to ratify the ancient league
between the hou&s;e of Burgundy and England<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Digges' Compleat amba&s;&s;ador, p. 369. Haynes, p. 585. S$rype, vol. IV. No 246.</NOTE>; he
furni&s;hed &s;hips to tran&s;port the French forces into Scot|land;
he endeavoured to intercept the earl of Arran,
who was ha&s;tening to join the malecontents in that
country; and the Queen's wi&s;e&s;t mini&s;ters &s;till regarded
his friend&s;hip as hollow and precarious<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Haynes, vol. I. p. 280, 281, 283, 284.</NOTE>. But no
&s;ooner did the death of Francis the &s;econd put an end
<PB N="69" REF="80">
to Philip's apprehen&s;ions with regard to Mary's
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, than his animo&s;ity again&s;t Elizabeth began
more openly to appear, and the intere&s;ts of Spain and
England were found oppo&s;ite in every negociation and
tran&s;action.</P>
<P>THE two great monarchies of the continent, France
and Spain, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of nearly equal force, were
naturally antagoni&s;ts; and England, from its power
and &s;ituation, was intitled to &s;upport its own dignity,
as well as tranquillity, by holding the ballance between
them. Whatever incident, therefore, tended too
much to depre&s;s any one of the&s;e rival powers, as it left
the other without controul, might be deemed contrary
to the intere&s;ts of England: Yet &s;o much were the&s;e
great maxims of policy over-ruled, during that age, by
the di&s;putes of theology, that Philip found an advan|tage
in &s;upporting the e&s;tabli&s;hed government and
religion of France; and Elizabeth in protecting faction
and innovation.</P>
<P>THE Queen-regent of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of France.</NOTE>, when re-in&s;tated in
authority by the death of her &s;on, Francis, had formed
a plan of admini&s;tration more &s;ubtle than judicious; and
ballancing the Catholics with the hugonots, the duke
of Gui&s;e with the prince of Corid&eacute;, &s;he endeavoured to
render her&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary to both, and to e&s;tabli&s;h her
own dominion on their con&s;trained obedience<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. ii. $span$</NOTE>. But
the equal counterpoi&s;e of power, which, among foreign
nations, is the &s;ource of tranquillity, proves always the
ground of quarrel between dome&s;tic factions; and if
the animo&s;ity of religion concur with the frequent
occa&s;ions which pre&s;ent them&s;elves of mutual injury,
it is impo&s;&s;ible, during any time, $o pre&s;erve a$firm
concord in &s;o delicate a &s;ituation. The con&s;table,
Montmorency, moved by zeal for the ancient faith,
joined him&s;elf to the duke of Gui&s;e: The King of
<PB N="70" REF="81">
Navarre, from his incon&s;tant temper, and his jealou&s;y
of the &s;uperior genius of his brother, embraced the &s;ame
party: And Catherine, finding her&s;elf depre&s;&s;ed by this
combination, had recour&s;e to Cond&eacute; and the hugonots,
who gladly embraced the opportunity of fortifying
them&s;elves by her countenance and protection<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">I bid. lib. iii.</NOTE>. An
edict had been publi&s;hed, granting a toleration to the
prote&s;tants; but the intere&s;ted violence of the duke of
Gui&s;e, covered with the pretence of religious zeal,
broke thro' this agreement; and the two parties, after
the fallacious tranquillity of a moment, renewed their
mutual in&s;ults and injuries. Cond&eacute;, Coligni, An|delot,
a&s;&s;embled their friends, and flew to arms: Gui&s;e
and Montmorency got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King's per&s;on,
and con&s;trained the Queen-regent to embrace their
party: Fourteen armies were levied and put in motion
in different places of France<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. vii.</NOTE>: Each province, each
city, each family, was agitated with inte&s;tine rage
and animo&s;ity. The father was divided again&s;t the
&s;on; the brother again&s;t the brother; and women
them&s;elves, &s;acrificing their humanity as well as their
timidity to the religious fury, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves
by acts of ferocity and valour<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">I bid.</NOTE>. Wherever the hu|gonots
prevailed, the images were broke, the altars
pillaged, the churches demoli&s;hed, the mona&s;teries con|&s;umed
with fire: Where &s;ucce&s;s attended the catholics,
they burned the bibles, re-baptized the in&s;ants, con|&s;trained
married per&s;ons to pa&s;s anew thro' the ceremo|ny:
And plunder, de&s;olation, and blood&s;hed attended
equally the triumph of both parties. The Parliament
of Paris it&s;elf, the &s;eat of law and ju&s;tice, in&s;tead of
employing its authority to compo&s;e the&s;e fatal quarrels,
publi&s;hed an edict, by which it put the &s;word into
the hands of the enraged multitude, and empowered
the catholics every where to ma&s;&s;acre the hugo|nots<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. vii. Haynes, p. 391.</NOTE>:
<PB N="71" REF="82">
And it was during this period, when men be|gan
to be &s;omewhat enlightened, and in this nation,
renowned for poli&s;hed manners, that the theological
rage, which had long been boiling in mens veins,
&s;eems to have attained its la&s;t &s;tage of virulence and
ferocity.</P>
<P>PHILIP, who was jealous of the progre&s;s which the
hugonots made in France, and who dreaded that the con|tagion
would &s;pread into the Low Country Provinces,
had formed a &s;ecret alliance with the princes of Gui&s;e,
and had entered into a mutual concert for the protec|tion
of the ancient faith, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of here&s;y.
He now &s;ent &s;ix thou&s;and men, with &s;ome &s;upply of
money, to reinforce the catholic party; and the prince
of Cond&eacute;, finding him&s;elf unequal to &s;o great a com|bination,
countenanced by the regal authority, was
obliged to di&s;patch the Vidame of Chartres and Bri|guemaut
to London, in order to crave the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
and protection of Elizabeth. Mo&s;t of the province of
Normandy was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the hugorots;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Havre de Grace put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> and Cond&eacute;
offered to put Havre de Grace into the hands of the
Engli&s;h; on condition, that, together with three thou|&s;and
men for the garri&s;on of that place, the Queen
&s;hould likewi&s;e &s;end over three thou&s;and to defend Di|eppe
and Rouen, and &s;hould furni&s;h the prince with
a &s;upply of a hundred thou&s;and crowns<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p. 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, be&s;ides the general and e&s;&s;ential inter|e&s;t
of &s;upporting the prote&s;tants, and oppo&s;ing the ra|pid
progre&s;s of her enemy, the duke of Gui&s;e, had other
motives which engaged her to accept this propo&s;al.
When &s;he concluded the peace at Cateau Cambre&s;is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th September.</NOTE>
&s;he had good rea&s;on to fore&s;ee, that France never
would voluntarily fulfil the article with regard to the
re&s;titution of Calais; and many &s;ub&s;equent incidents
<PB N="72" REF="83">
had tended to confirm this &s;u&s;picion. Con&s;iderable
&s;ums of money had been laid out on the fortifications;
long lea&s;es had been granted of the lands; and ma|ny
inhabitants had been encouraged to build and &s;ettle
there, by a&s;&s;urances that Calais &s;hould never be re&s;tored
to the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Forbes, p. 54, 257.</NOTE>. The Queen, therefore, very wi&s;ely
concluded, that could &s;he get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Havre, a
place which commanded the mouth of the Seine, and
was of much gr$$ter importance than Calais, &s;he &s;hould
ea&s;ily con&s;train the French to execute the treaty, and
&s;hould have the glory of re&s;toring to the crown that
anc$ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which was &s;o much the favourite of
the nation.</P>
<P>NO mea&s;ure could be more generally odious in
France, than the conclu&s;ion of this treaty with Eliza|beth.
Men were naturally led to compare the con|duct
of Gui&s;e, who had finally cha&s;ed the Engli&s;h from
France, and had debarred the&s;e dangerous and de&s;truc|tive
enemies from all acce&s;s into it, with the trea&s;ona|ble
politics of Cond&eacute;, who had again granted them an
entry into the heart of the kingdom. The prince had
the more rea&s;on to repent of this mea&s;ure, as he reaped
not from it all the advantage which he expected. Three
thou&s;and Engli&s;h immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Hav$e
and Dieppe, under the command of Sir Edward
Poinings; but the latter place was found &s;o little capa|ble
of being defended, that it was immediately abando|ned<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid, vol. II. p. 199.</NOTE>. The &s;iege of Rouen was already formed by
the catholics, under the command of the King of Na|varre
and the con&s;table Montmorency; and it was with
difficulty that Poinings could throw a &s;mall reinforce|ment
into the place. Tho' the&s;e Engli&s;h troops be|haved
with great gallantry<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 161.</NOTE>, and the King of Navarre
was mortally wounded during the &s;iege; the catholics
<PB N="73" REF="84">
&s;till continued the attack of the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">156.</NOTE> and carrying it
at la&s;t by a&s;&s;ault, put the whole garri&s;on to the &s;word.
The earl of Warwic, elde&s;t &s;on to the late duke of Nor|thumberland,
arrived &s;oon after at Havre, with ano|ther
body of three thou&s;and Engli&s;h, and took on him
the command of the place.</P>
<P>IT was expected, that the French catholics, flu&s;hed
with their &s;ucce&s;s at Rouen, would immediately have
formed the &s;iege of Havre, which was not as yet in
any condition of defence; but the inte&s;tine di&s;orders of
the kingdom &s;oon diverted their attention to another
enterprize. Andelot, &s;econded by the negociations of
Elizabeth, had levied a con&s;iderable body of prote&s;tants
in Germany; and having arrived at Orleans, the &s;eat
of the hugonot's power, he enabled the prince of Con|d&eacute;
and the admiral to take the field, and oppo&s;e the pro|gre&s;s
of their enemies. After threatning Paris dur|ing
&s;ome time, they took their march towards Nor|mandy,
with a view of engaging the Engli&s;h to act in
conjunction with them, and of fortifying them&s;elves
with the farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they expected from
the zeal and vigour of Elizabeth<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Forbes, p. 230. Davila, lib. iii.</NOTE>. The catholics, com|manded
by the con&s;table, and under him by the duke
of Gui&s;e, followed on their rear; and overtaking them
at Dreux, obliged them to give battle. The field was
fought with great ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides: and the ac|tion
was di&s;tingui&s;hed by this &s;ignal event, that Cond&eacute;
and Montmorency, the commanders of the oppo&s;ite
armies, remained both of them pri&s;oners in the hands
of their enemies. The appearances of victory remain|ed
with Gui&s;e; but the admiral, who&s;e fate it ever was

collected the remains of the army, and in&s;pir|ing

<P>THE expences incurred by a&s;&s;i&s;ting the French hu|gonots
had emptied the Queen's exchequer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1563. 12 January. A Parliament.</NOTE> notwith|&s;tanding
her extreme frugality; and in order to obtain
&s;upply, &s;he found her&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ummon|ing
a Parliament: An expedient to which &s;he never
voluntarily had recour&s;e. A little before the meet|ing
of this a&s;&s;embly, &s;he had fallen into a dangerous
illne&s;s, the &s;mall pox; and as her life, during &s;ome
time, was de&s;paired of, the people became the more
&s;en&s;ible of the perilous condition in which they &s;tood,
on account of the uncertainty which, in ca&s;e of her
decea&s;e, attended the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown. The
partizans of the Queen of Scots, and tho&s;e of the hou&s;e
of Suffolk, already divided the nation into factions;
and every one fore&s;aw, that, tho' it might be po&s;&s;ible
at pre&s;ent to determine the controver&s;y by law, yet,
if the throne was vacant, nothing but the &s;word would
be able to fix a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The commons, therefore,
on the very opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, voted an addre&s;s to
the Queen; in which, after enumerating the dan|gers
attending a broken and doubtful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and
mentioning the evils which their fathers had experien|ced
from the contending titles of York and Lanca&s;|ter,
they entreated the Queen to put an end to their ap|prehen&s;ions,
by choo&s;ing &s;ome hu&s;band, whom, they
promi&s;ed, whoever he was, gratefully to receive, and
faithfully to &s;erve, honour, and obey: Or if &s;he had
entertained any reluctance to the married &s;tate, they
de&s;ired, that the lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;or might be named, or
<PB N="75" REF="86">
at lea&s;t appointed by act of parliament. They re|marked,
that during all the reigns which had pa&s;&s;ed
&s;ince the conque&s;t, the nation had never before been
&s;o unhappy, as not to know the per&s;on who, in ca&s;e
of the &s;overeign's death, was legally entitled to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.
And they ob&s;erved, that the certain and fix|ed
order which took place in the inheritance of the
French monarchy, was one chief &s;ource of the u&s;ual
tranquillity, as well as of the happine&s;s of that king|dom<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sir Simon Dewes's Journ. p. 81.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject, tho' extremely intere&s;ting to the na|tion,
was very little agreeable to the Queen; and &s;he
was &s;en&s;ible, that great difficulties would attend eve|ry
deci&s;ion. A declaration in favour of the Queen of
Scots, would form a &s;ettlement perfectly legal; be|cau&s;e
that prince&s;s was commonly allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s
the right of blood, and the exclu&s;ion given by Henry's
will, deriving its weight chiefly from an act of parlia|ment,
would lo&s;e all authority whenever the Queen
and Parliament had made a new &s;ettlement, and re|&s;tored
the Scotti&s;h line to their place in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
But &s;he dreaded the giving encouragement to the ca|tholics
her &s;ecret enemies, by this declaration. She
was &s;en&s;ible, that every heir was, in &s;ome degree, a ri|val;
much more one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a claim for the pre|&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, and who had already ad|vanced,
in a very open manner, the&s;e dangerous pre|ten&s;ions.
The great power of Mary, both from the
favour of the catholic princes, and her connections
with the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e, not to mention the force and
&s;ituation of Scotland, was well known to her; and &s;he
&s;aw no &s;ecurity that that prince&s;s, if fortified by a &s;ure
pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would not again revive claims
which &s;he could never yet be prevailed on formally
<PB N="76" REF="87">
to relinqui&s;h. On the other hand, the title of the
hou&s;e of Suffolk was &s;upported only by the more zea|lous
prote&s;tants; and it was very doubtful, whether
even a parliamentary declaration in its favour would
be&s;tow on it &s;uch validity as to give &s;atisfaction to the
people. The republican part of the con&s;titution had
not as yet acquired &s;uch an a&s;cendant as to controul,
in any degree, the ideas of hereditary right; and as the
legality of Henry's will was &s;till di&s;puted, tho' founded
on the utmo&s;t authority which a Parliament could be&s;tow;
who could be a&s;&s;ured, that a more recent act would be
acknowleged to have any greater force or validity? In
the frequent revolutions which had of late taken place,
the right of blood had &s;till prevailed over religious preju|dices;
and the nation had ever &s;hewed it&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed
rather to change its faith than the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
Even many Prote&s;tants declared them&s;elves in favour
of Mary's claim of inheritance<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 322.</NOTE>; and nothing would
endanger more general di&s;gu&s;t, than to &s;ee the Queen
openly, and without re&s;erve, take party again&s;t it.
That prince&s;s al&s;o, finding her&s;elf injured in &s;o &s;en&s;ible
a point, would thenceforth act as a declared enemy;
and uniting together her foreign and dome&s;tic friends,
the partizans of her pre&s;ent title and of her eventual
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would &s;oon bring matters to extremity
again&s;t the public e&s;tabli&s;hment. The Queen, weigh|ing
all the&s;e inconveniences, which were great and ur|gent,
was determined to keep both parties in awe,
by maintaining &s;till an ambiguous conduct; and &s;he
cho&s;e rather that the people &s;hould run the hazard of
contingent events, than that her&s;elf &s;hould vi&s;ibly en|danger
her throne, by employing expedients, which,
at be&s;t, did not give entire &s;ecurity to the nation. She
made, therefore, an eva&s;ive an&s;wer to the applications
of the commons; and when the hou&s;e, at the end of the
<PB N="77" REF="88">
&s;e&s;&s;ions, desired, by the mouth of their &s;peaker, far|ther
&s;atisfaction on that head, &s;he could not be prevail|ed
on to make her reply more explicite. She only told
them, contrary to her declarations in the beginning of
her reign, that &s;he had fixed no ab&s;olute re&s;olution
again&s;t marriage; and &s;he added, that the difficulties
with which the que&s;tion of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was attended,
were &s;o great, that &s;he would be contented, for their
&s;ake, to remain &s;ome time longer in this vale of mi&s;ery;
and never &s;hould depart this life with &s;atisfaction, till
&s;he had laid &s;ome &s;olid foundation for their future
&s;ecurity<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Sir Simon D' Ewes's Journal, p. 75.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t remarkable law pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion was that
which bore the title of <HI>A&s;&s;urance of the Queen's royal pow|er
over all &s;tates and &s;ubjects within her dominions</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">5 Eliz. c. r.</NOTE>. By
this act, the a&s;&s;erting twice by writing, word, or deed,
the pope's authority, was &s;ubjected to the penalties of
trea&s;on. All per&s;ons in holy orders were bound to
take the oath of &s;upremacy; as al&s;o, all who were ad|vanced
to any degrees, either in the univer&s;ities or in
common law; all &s;choolma&s;ters, officers in court, or
members of Parliament: And the penalty of their &s;e|cond
refu&s;al was trea&s;on. The fir&s;t offence in both
ca&s;es, was puni&s;hed by bani&s;hment and forfeiture.
This rigorous &s;tatute, which involved a real, tho' not
general, per&s;ecution, and of the wor&s;t kind too, as it
made a &s;crutiny into mens &s;ecret &s;entiments, was not
extended to any of the degree of a baron; becau&s;e it
was not &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Queen could entertain any
doubt with regard to the fidelity of per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of &s;uch high dignity. The lord Montacute made vi|gorous
oppo&s;ition to this bill; and a&s;&s;erted, in favour
of the catholies, that they di&s;puted not, they preached
not, they di&s;obeyed not the Queen, they cau&s;ed no
<PB N="78" REF="89">
trouble no tumults among the people<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 260.</NOTE>. It is, how|ever,
probable, that &s;ome &s;u&s;picions of their &s;ecret con|&s;piracies
had made the Queen and Parliament increa&s;e
their rigour again&s;t them; tho' it is al&s;o more than
probable, that they were mi&s;taken in the nature of the
remedy.</P>
<P>THERE was likewi&s;e another point in which the
Parliament, this &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hewed more the goodne&s;s of
their intention than the &s;oundne&s;s of their judgment.
They pa&s;&s;ed a law again&s;t fond and fanta&s;tical prophe|cies,
which had been ob&s;erved to &s;educe the people in|to
rebellion and di&s;order<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">5 Eliz. c. 15.</NOTE>: But at the &s;ame time they
enacted a &s;tatute which was mo&s;t likely to increa&s;e
the&s;e and &s;uch like &s;uper&s;titions: It was levelled again&s;t
conjurations, enchantments, and witchcrafts<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 16.</NOTE>. Witch|craft
and here&s;y are two crimes which commonly in|crea&s;e
by puni&s;hment, and never are &s;o effectually &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed
as by being totally neglected. After the Par|liament
had granted the Queen a &s;upply of one &s;ub&s;i|dy
and two fifteenths, i$ was fini&s;hed by a prorogation.
The convocation likewi&s;e voted the Queen a &s;ub&s;idy
of &s;ix &s;hillings in the pound, payable in three
years.</P>
<P>WHILE the Engli&s;h parties exerted the&s;e calm ef|forts
again&s;t each other, in parliamentary votes and de|bates,
the French factions, enflamed to the highe&s;t de|gree
of animo&s;ity, continued that cruel war which
their intemperate zeal, actuated by the ambition of
their leaders, had kindled in the kingdom. The ad|miral
was &s;ucce&s;sful in reducing the towns of Norman|dy
which held for the King; but he frequently com|plained,
that the numerous garri&s;on of Havre remained
totally unactive, and was not employed in any milita|ry
operations again&s;t the common enemy. The Queen,
in taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place, had publi&s;hed a ma|nife&s;to<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II.</NOTE>,
<PB N="79" REF="90">
in which &s;he pretended, that her concern for
the French King's intere&s;t had engaged her in that
mea&s;ure, and that her &s;ole intention was to oppo&s;e
her enemies of the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e, who held their
prince in captivity, and employed his power to the de|&s;truction
of his be&s;t and mo&s;t faithful &s;ubjects. It
was chiefly her de&s;ire to pre&s;erve appearances, joined
to the great frugality of her temper, which made her,
at this critical juncture, keep her &s;oldiers in garri&s;on,
and re&s;train them from committing farther ho&s;tilities
upon the enemy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 276, 277.</NOTE>. The duke of Gui&s;e, meanwhile,
was aiming a mortal blow at the power of the hugo|nots;
and had commenced the &s;iege of Orleans, which
was commanded by Andelot, and where the con&s;ta|ble
was detained pri&s;oner. He had the pro&s;pect of
&s;peedy &s;ucce&s;s in this undertaking; when he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated
by Poltrot, a young gentleman, who&s;e zeal,
in&s;tigated (as it is pretended, tho' without any certain
foundation) by the admiral and Beza, a famous preach|er,
led him to attempt that criminal enterpri&s;e. The
death of this gallant prince was a very &s;en&s;ible lo&s;s to
the catholic party; and tho' the cardinal of Lorraine,
his brother, &s;till &s;upported the intere&s;ts of the family,
the danger of their progre&s;s appeared much le&s;s immi|nent,
both to Queen Elizabeth and to the French
prote&s;tants. The union, therefore, between the&s;e al|lies,
which had been cementedby their common fears, be|gan
thenceforth to be le&s;s intimate; and the leaders of the
hugonots were per&s;uaded to hearken to terms of accom|modation.
Cond&eacute; and Montmorency held conferences
for &s;ettling the peace; and as they were both of them im|patient
to relieve them&s;elves from captivity, they &s;oon
came to an agreement with regard to the conditions.
The character of the Queen-regent, who&s;e ends were
always violent, but who endeavoured, by &s;ubtilty and
<PB N="80" REF="91">
policy, rather than force, to attain them, led her to
embrace any plau&s;ible terms; and in &s;pite of the admi|ral's
prote&s;tations, who&s;e &s;agacity could ea&s;ily di&s;co|ver
the treachery of the court, the articles of agreement
were finally &s;ettled between the parties. A toleration,
under &s;ome re&s;trictions, was anew granted to the pro|te&s;tants;
a general amne&s;ty was publi&s;hed; Cond&eacute;
was rein&s;tated in his offices and governments; and
after money was advanced for the payment of arrears
due to the German troops, they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the
kingdom.</P>
<P>BY the agreement between Elizabeth and the prince
of Cond&eacute;, it had been &s;tipulated<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Forbes, vol. II. p. 79.</NOTE>, that neither party
&s;hould conclude peace without the con&s;ent of the
other; but this article was at pre&s;ent but little regarded
by the leaders of the French prote&s;tants. They on|ly
comprehended her &s;o far in the treaty, as to obtain
a promi&s;e, that, on her relinqui&s;hing Havre, her char|ges
and the money which &s;he had advanced them,
&s;hould be repaid her by the King of France, and that
Calais, on the expiration of the term, &s;hould be re&s;to|red
to her. But &s;he di&s;dained to accept of the&s;e terms;
and thinking the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Havre a much better
pledge for the obtaining her purpo&s;e, &s;he &s;ent War|wic
orders to prepare him&s;elf again&s;t an attack from
the now united power of the French monarchy.</P>
<P>THE earl of Warwic, who commanded a garri&s;on
of &s;ix thou&s;and men, be&s;ide &s;even hundred pioniers, had
no &s;ooner got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Havre, than he employed
every means for putting it in a po&s;ture of defence<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 153.</NOTE>; and
after expelling the French from the town, he encoura|ged
his &s;oldiers to make the mo&s;t de&s;perate defence
again&s;t the enemy. The con&s;table commanded the
French army; the Queen-regent her&s;elf, and the
<PB N="81" REF="92">
King, were pre&s;ent in the camp; even the prince of
Cond&eacute; joined the King's forces, and gave counte|nance
to this enterpri&s;e; the admiral and Andelot alone,
who &s;till de&s;ired to pre&s;erve Elizabeth's friend&s;hip,
kept at a di&s;tance, and prudently refu&s;ed to join their
antient enemies in an attack upon their allies.</P>
<P>BY the force, and di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;ituation of both
&s;ides, it was expected, that the &s;iege would be attend|ed
with &s;ome very memorable event; yet did France
make a much ea&s;ier acqui&s;ition of this important place,
than was at fir&s;t apprehended. The plague crept in
among the Engli&s;h &s;oldiers; and being encrea&s;ed by
their fatigue and bad diet (for they were but ill &s;up|plied
with provi&s;ions<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Forbes, p. 377, 45.</NOTE>) it committed &s;ue$ revages,
that &s;ometimes a hundred men a day di$$ of it, and
there remained not at la&s;t fifteen hundred in a condi|tion
to do duty<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 450, 458.</NOTE>. The French, meeting with &s;uch
feeble re&s;i&s;tance, carried on their attacks &s;ucce&s;sfully;
and having made two breaches, each of them &s;ixty feet
wide, they prepared for a general a&s;&s;ault, which mu&s;t
have terminated in the &s;laughter of the whole garri|&s;on<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid, vol. II. p. 49</NOTE>. Warwic, who had frequently warned the Engli&s;h
council of the danger, and who had loudly demanded
a &s;upply of men and provi&s;ions, found him&s;elf obliged
to capitulate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Havre lo&s;t. 28th July.</NOTE> and to content him&s;elf with the liberty
of withdrawing his garri&s;on. The articles$ were no
&s;ooner &s;igned, than lord Clinton, the admiral, who
had been detained by contrary winds, appeared off
the harbour with a reinforcement of three thou&s;and
men; and found the place &s;urrendered to the enemy.
To encrea&s;e the misfortune, the infected army brought
the plague with them into England, where it &s;wept
off great multitudes, particularly in the city of Lon|don.

The religious controver&s;ies were too far advanced to expect any conviction would re&s;ult from the decrees of this council.

it was with &s;ome difficulty that he was able to give

carefully avoided touching on this delicate &s;ubject,
&s;he employed a pretence of the wars in France,
which, &s;he &s;aid, would detain her in London; and &s;he
delayed till next year the intended interview. It is
al&s;o probable, that, being well acquainted with the
beauty and addre&s;s and accompli&s;hments of Mary, &s;he
did not cho&s;e to &s;tand the compari&s;on with regard to
tho&s;e exterior qualities, in which &s;he was eclip&s;ed by

<P>MARY's clo&s;e connexions with the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e,
and her devoted attachment to her uncles, by whom
&s;he had been educated and protected, was the ground
of ju&s;t and un&s;urmountable jealou&s;y to Elizabeth, who
regarded them as her mortal and declared enemies,
and was well acquainted with their dangerous charact|er
and ambitious projects. They had made offer of
their niece to Don Carlos, Philip's &s;on; to the King
of Sweeden, the King of Navarre, the archduke
Charles, the duke of Ferrara, the cardinal of Bourbon,
who had only taken deacons orders, from which he
might ea&s;ily be ab&s;olved; and they were ready to marry

&s;ide where it was weake&s;t and lay mo&s;t expo&s;ed<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 247, 284.</NOTE>. As
&s;he believed, that the marriage with the archduke
Charles was the one mo&s;t likely to have place, &s;he
u&s;ed every expedient to prevent it; and be&s;ides remon|&s;trating
again&s;t it to Mary her&s;elf, &s;he endeavoured to
draw off the archduke from that pur&s;uit, by giving him
&s;ome rea&s;on to hope for &s;ucce&s;s in his preten&s;ions to
her&s;elf, and by inviting him to a renewal of the former
treaty of marriage<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 41.</NOTE>. She always told the Queen of
Scots, that nothing would &s;atisfy her but her e&s;pou&s;ing
&s;ome Engli&s;h nobleman, who would remove all
grounds of jealou&s;y, and cement the union between
the two kingdoms; and &s;he offered on this condition
to have her title examined, and to declare her the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or
to the crown<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 243, 249, 259, 265.</NOTE>. After keeping the matter in the&s;e
general terms during a twelvemonth, &s;he at la&s;t named
the lord Robert Dudley, now created earl of Leice&s;ter,
as the per&s;on on whom &s;he de&s;ired that Mary's choice
&s;hould fall.</P>
<P>THE earl of Leice&s;ter, the great and powerful
favourite of Elizabeth, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e exterior qua|lities,
which are naturally alluring to the fair &s;ex; a
hand&s;ome per&s;on, a polite addre&s;s, an in&s;inuating
behaviour; and by means of the&s;e acompli&s;hments, he
had been able to blind even the penetration of Eli|zabeth,
and conceal from her the great defects, or
rather odious vices, which attended his character.
He was proud, in&s;olent, intere&s;ted, ambitious; without
honour, without genero&s;ity, without humanity; and
attoned not for the&s;e bad qualities, by any &s;uch abilities
or courage, as could fit him for that high tru&s;t and
confidence with which &s;he always honoured him.
<PB N="85" REF="96">
Her con&s;tant and declaed attachment to him had very
naturally emboldened him to a&s;pire to her bed; and in
order to make way for the&s;e nuptials, he was univer|&s;ally
believed to have murdered, in a barbarous manner,
his wife, the heire&s;s of one Robe&s;art. The propo&s;al
of e&s;pou&s;ing Mary was by no means agreeable to him;
and he always a&s;cribed it to the contrivance of Cecil,
his enemy; who intented by that artifice to make him
lo&s;e the friend&s;hip of Mary from the temerity of his
preten&s;ions, and that of Elizabeth from jealou&s;y of
his attachments to another woman<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 396.</NOTE>. The Queen
her&s;elf had not any &s;erous intention of effecting this
marriage; but, as &s;he was de&s;irous, that the Queen
of Scots &s;hould never take any hu&s;band, &s;he named
a man, who &s;he believed, was not likely to be ac|cepted
of; and &s;he hoped, by that means, to gain
time, and elude the project of any other alliance.
The earl of Leice&s;ter was too great a favourite to be
parted with; and when Mary, allured by the pro&s;pect
of being declared &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown, &s;eemed at
la&s;t to hearken to Elizabeth's propo&s;al, this prince&s;s
receded from her former offers, and withdrew the bait,
which &s;he had formerly thrown out to her rival<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 269, 270. Appendix, p. 158. Strype, vol. I. p. 414.</NOTE>.
This duplicity of conduct, joined to &s;ome appearance
of an imperious &s;uperiority, a&s;&s;umed by her, had drawn
a peevi&s;h letter from Mary; and the &s;eemingly ami|cable
corre&s;pondence of the two Queens was, during
&s;ome time, interrupted. In order to make up this
breach, the Queen of Scots di&s;patched Sir James
Melvil to London; who has given us a very particu|lar
accont of his negociation.</P>
<P>MELVIL was an agreeable courtier, a man of ad|dre&s;s
and conver&s;ation; and it was recommended to
him by his mi&s;tre&s;s, that, be&s;ides grave rea&s;onings
<PB N="86" REF="97">
concerning politics and &s;tate-affairs, he &s;hould in|troduce
more entertaining topics of conver&s;ation,
&s;uitable to the &s;prightly character of Elizabeth; and
&s;hould endeavour by that means to in&s;inuate him&s;lef
into her confidence. He &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that he
threw that artful prince&s;s entirely off her guard<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hayzes, p. 447.</NOTE>, and
brought her to di&s;cover the bottom of her heart,
full of all tho&s;e levities and follies and ideas of rival|&s;hip,
which po&s;&s;e&s;s the younge&s;t and mo&s;t frivolous
of her &s;ex. He talked to her of his travels, and forgot
not to mention the different dre&s;&s;es of the ladies in
different countries, and the particular advantages of
each, in &s;etting off the beauties of the &s;hape and per|&s;on.
The Queen &s;aid that &s;he had dre&s;&s;es of all
countries, and &s;he took care thenceforth to meet the
amba&s;&s;ador every day apparelled $in a different habit:
Sometimes &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed in the Engli&s;h garb, &s;ome|times
in the French, &s;ometimes in the Italian; and
&s;he a&s;ked him, which of them became her mo&s;t. He
an&s;wered, the Italian; a reply, that he knew would
be agreeable to her, becau&s;e that mode &s;howed her
flowing locks, which, he remarked, tho' they were
more red than yellow, &s;he fancied to be the fine&s;t in
the world. She de&s;ired to know of him what was
reputed the be&s;t colour of hair: She a&s;ked whether his
Queen's hair or hers was be&s;t: She even enquired
which of them he e&s;teemed the faire&s;t per&s;on: A very
delicate que&s;tion, and which he prudently eluded, by
&s;aying that her maje&s;ty was the faire&s;t per&s;on in Eng|land,
and his mi&s;tre&s;s in Scotland. She next demand|ed
which of them was talle&s;t: He replied, his queen:
Then, &s;aid Elizabeth, &s;he is too tall: For I$ my&s;elf
am of a ju&s;t &s;tature. Having learned from him, that
his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ometimes recreated her&s;elf by playing on
the harp&s;icord, an in&s;trument on which &s;he her&s;elf
<PB N="87" REF="98">
excelled, &s;he gave orders to lord Hun&s;don, that he
&s;hould lead him as it were ca&s;ually, into an apartment,
where he might hear her perform; and when Melvil,
as if ravi&s;hed with the harmony, broke into the
Queen's apartment, &s;he pretended to be di&s;plea&s;ed
at his intru&s;ion; but &s;till took care to a&s;k him whether
he thought Mary or her the be&s;t performer on that
in&s;trument<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Melvil. p, 49, 50.</NOTE>. From the whole of her behaviour,
Melvil thought he might, on his return, a&s;&s;ure his
mi&s;tre&s;s that &s;he had no rea&s;on ever to expect any
cordial friend&s;hip from Elizabeth, and that all her pro|fe&s;&s;ions
of amity were full of fal&s;hood and di&s;&s;imula|tion.</P>
<P>AFTER
two years had been &s;pent in eva&s;ions and
artfices<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 264.</NOTE>, Mary's &s;ubjects and coun&s;ellors, and pro|bably
her&s;elf, began to think it full time that &s;ome
alliance were concluded; and the lord Darnley, &s;on
to the earl of Lenox, was the per&s;on, in whom mo&s;t
mens opinons and wi&s;hes centered. He was Mary's
cou&s;in-german, by the lady Margaret Douglas, niece
to Harry the eighth, and daughter to the earl of An|gus,
by Margaret, Queen of Scotland. He had been
born and educated in England, where the earl of
Lenox had con&s;tantly re&s;ided, ever &s;ince he had been
bani&s;hed by the prevailing power of the hou&s;e of Ha|milton;
and as Darnley was now in his twentieth
year, and was a ver comely per&s;on, tall and delicately
&s;haped, it was hoped, that he might &s;oon render him|&s;elf
agreeable to the Queen of Scots. He was al&s;o by
his father a branch of the &s;ame family with her&s;elf;
and would, in e&s;pou&s;ing her, pre&s;erve the royal dig|nity
in the hou&s;e of Stuart: He was, after her, next
heir to the crown of England; and tho&s;e who pre|tended
to exclude her on account of her being a fo|reigner,
had endeavoured to recommend his title, and
<PB N="88" REF="99">
give it the preference. It &s;eemed no incon&s;iderable
advantage, that &s;he could, by marrying him, unite
both their claims; and as he was by birth an Engli&s;h|man,
and could not by his power or alliances give any
ground of &s;u&s;picion to Elizabeth, it was hoped that
the propo&s;al of this marriage would not be unaccept|able
to that jealous prince&s;s.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was well informed of the&s;e intentions
of the court of Edinburgh<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 261.</NOTE>; and was &s;ecretly not di&s;|plea&s;ed
with the projected marriage between Darnley
and the Queen of Scots<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 280, 282. Jebb, vol. II. p. 46.</NOTE>. She would rather have
wi&s;hed, that Mary had continued for ever in a &s;ingle
life; but finding little probability of rendering this
&s;cheme effectual, &s;he was &s;atisfied with a choice,
which freed her at once from the dread of a foreign
alliance, and from the nece&s;&s;ity of parting with Lei|ce&s;ter,
her favourite. In order to pave the way to
Darnley's marriage, &s;he &s;ecretly de&s;ired Mary to in|vite
Lenox into Scotland, to rever&s;e his attainder,
and to re&s;tore him to his honours and fortune<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 255, 259, 272.</NOTE>. And
when her reque&s;t was complied with, &s;he took care,
in order to pre&s;erve the friend&s;hip of the Hamiltons
and her other partizans in Scotland, to blame openly
this conduct of Mary<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 42.</NOTE>. Hearing that the negotiation
for Darnley's marriage proceeded apace, &s;he gave that
nobleman permi&s;&s;ion, on his fir&s;t application, to follow
his father into Scotland: But no &s;ooner did &s;he learn,
that the Queen of Scots was taken with his figure and
per&s;on, and that all mea&s;ures were fixed for e&s;pou&s;ing
him, than &s;he exclaimed again&s;t the marriage; &s;ent
Throcmorton to order Darnley immediately upon his
allegiance, to return into England; threw the coun|te&s;s
of Lenox and her &s;econd &s;on into the Tower,
where they &s;uffered a very rigorous confinement;
<PB N="89" REF="100">
&s;eized all Lenox's Engli&s;h e&s;tate; and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1565.</NOTE> tho' in was im|po&s;&s;ible
for her to a&s;&s;ign one &s;ingle rea&s;on of her di&s;|plea&s;ure<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 274, 275.</NOTE>, $&s;he menaced, and prote&s;ted, and com|plained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th July.</NOTE> as if &s;he had &s;uffered the mo&s;t grievous injury
in the world.</P>
<P>THE politics of Elizabeth, tho' judicious, were
u&s;ually full of duplicity and artifice; but never more
&s;o than in her tran&s;actions with the Queen of Scots,
where there entered &s;o many little pa&s;&s;ions and narrow
jealou&s;ies, that &s;he dur&s;t not avow to the world the
rea&s;ons of her conduct, &s;carcely to her mini&s;ters, and
&s;carcely even to her&s;elf. But be&s;ides a womani&s;h
rival&s;hip and envy again&s;t the marriage of this prin|ce&s;s,
&s;he had &s;ome motives of intere&s;t for feigning a
di&s;plea&s;ure on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. It &s;erved her as
a pretence for refu&s;ing to acknowledge Mary's title to
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of England; a point to which &s;he was
determined never to con&s;ent. And it was u&s;eful to
her for a purpo&s;e, &s;till more unfriendly and dangerous,
for encouraging the di&s;contents and rebellion of the
Scotti&s;h nobility and eccle&s;ia&s;tics<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 290.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more unhappy for a people than
to be governed by a &s;overeign, who is attached to a
religion different from that which is e&s;tabli&s;hed; and
it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible, that a mutual confidence can
ever, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, have place between the
prince and his &s;ubjects. Mary's conduct had been
hitherto, in every re&s;pect, unexceptionable, and even
laudable; yet had &s;he not made &s;uch progre&s;s in ac|quiring
popularity, as might have been expected from
her gracious deportment and agreeable accompli&s;h|ments.
Su&s;picions every moment prevailed on ac|count
of her attachment to the catholic faith, and
e&s;pecially to her uncles, the open and avowed pro|moters
of the &s;cheme for exterminating the profe&s;&s;ors
<PB N="90" REF="101">
of the reformed religion throughout all Europe. She
&s;till refu&s;ed to ratify the acts of Parliament, which had
e&s;tabli&s;hed the reformation; &s;he made attempts for re|&s;toring
to the catholic bi&s;hops &s;ome part of their civil
juri&s;diction<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 198.</NOTE>; and &s;he wrote a letter to the council
of Trent, in which, be&s;ides profe&s;&s;ing her attachment
to the catholic faith, &s;he took notice of her title to
&s;ucceed to the crown of England, and expre&s;&s;ed her
hopes of being able, in &s;ome period, to bring back
all her dominions to the bo&s;om of the church<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. vii.</NOTE> The
zealots among the prote&s;tants were not wanting, in
their turn, to practi&s;e in&s;ults upon her, which tended
&s;till more to alienate her from their faith. A law
was enacted, making it capital, even on the fir&s;t
offence, to &s;ay ma&s;s any where, except in the Queen's
chappel<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 268.</NOTE>; and it was with great difficulty that even
this &s;mall indulgence was granted her: The general
a&s;&s;embly importuned her anew to change her religion,
to renounce the bla&s;phemous idolatry of the ma&s;s, with
the tyranny of the Roman Antichri&s;t, and to em|brace
the true religion of Chrift Je&s;us<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 545. Knox, p. 374.</NOTE> As &s;he an|&s;wered
with temper, that &s;he was not yet convinced
of the fal&s;hood of her religion or the impiety of the
ma&s;s; and that her apo&s;tacy would lo&s;e her the friend|&s;hip
of her allies on the continent; they replied, by
a&s;&s;uring her, that their religion was undoubtedly the
&s;ame which had been revealed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which
had been preached by the apo&s;tles, and which had
been embraced by the faithful in the primitive ages;
that neither the religion of Turks, Jews, nor Papi&s;ts
was built on &s;o &s;olid a foundation as theirs; that they
alone, of all the various &s;pecies of religioni&s;ts &s;pread
over the face of the earth, were &s;o happy as to be
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the truth; that tho&s;e who hear, or rather
<PB N="91" REF="102">
who gaze on the ma&s;s, allow &s;acrilege, pronounce bla&s;|phemy,
and commit mo&s;t abominable idolatry; and that
the friend&s;hip of the King of kings was preferable to
all the confederacies and alliances in the world<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Keith, 550, 551.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE marriage of the Queen of Scots had kindled
afre&s;h the zeal of the reformers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen of Scots marries the earl of Darn|ley.</NOTE> becau&s;e the family of
Lenox was believed to adhere to the catholic faith;
and tho' Darnley, who now bore the name of King
Henry, went often to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, he could
not, by this exterior compliance, gain the confidence
and regard of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics. They rather laid hold
of this opportunity to in&s;ult him to his face; and Knox
&s;crupled not to tell him from the pulpit, that God, for
puni&s;hment of the offences and ingratitude of the peo|ple,
was wont to commit the rule over them to boys
and women<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 546. Knox, p. 381.</NOTE> The populace of Edinburgh, in&s;tiga|ted
by &s;uch doctrine, began to meet and to a&s;&s;ociate
them&s;elves again&s;t the government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 377.</NOTE> But what threat|ned
with more immediate danger Mary's authority,
were the di&s;contents which prevailed among &s;ome of
the principal nobility.</P>
<P>THE duke of Chatelrault was di&s;plea&s;ed with the
re&s;toration, and &s;till more with the aggrandizement,
of the family of Lenox, his hereditary enemies; and
entertained fears left his eventual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the
crown of Scotland &s;hould be excluded by his rival, who
had formerly advanced &s;ome preten&s;ions to it. The
earl of Murray found his credit at court much di|mini&s;hed
by the intere&s;t of Lenox, and his &s;on; and
began to apprehend the revocation of &s;ome con|&s;iderable
grants which he had obtained from Mary's
liberality. The earls of Argyle, Rothes, and Glen|cairne,
the lords Boyde and Ochiltry, Kirkaldy of
<PB N="92" REF="103">
Grange, Pittarow, were in&s;tigated by like motives;
and as the&s;e were the per&s;ons who had mo&s;t zealou&s;ly
promoted the reformation, they were di&s;gu&s;ted to find
that the Queen's favour was entirely engro&s;&s;ed by a
new cabal, the earls of Bothwel, Athole, Sutherland,
and Huntley; men who were e&s;teemed either luke|warm
in religious controver&s;y, or inclined to the ca|tholic
party. The &s;ame ground of di&s;content, which,
in other courts, is the &s;cource of intrigue, faction,
and oppo&s;ition, commonly produced in Scotland, either
projects of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, or of rebellion; and be&s;ides
mutual accu&s;ations of the former kind, which it is
difficult to clear up<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">It appears, however, from Randolf's Letters, Keith, p. 290, that &s;ome offers had been made to that mini&s;ter, of &s;eizing Lenox and Darn|ley, and delivering them into Queen Elizabeth's hands.

their &s;overeign. They met at Stirling; pretended an
anxious concern for the &s;ecurity of religion; framed
engagements for mutual defence; and made applica|tions

That &s;he might more effectually cut off all their re|&s;ources,

Hamilton, and thence to Edinburgh, which they en|tered

&s;overeign; and after &s;ome &s;ollicitation, and &s;ome pro|fe&s;&s;ions
of &s;incere repentance, the duke of Chatelrault
obtained his pardon, on condition that he &s;hould retire
into France. Mary was more implacable again&s;t the
ungrateful earl of Murray, and the other confederates,
on whom &s;he threw the chief blame of the enterprize;
but as &s;he was continually $ plied with applications
from their friends, and as &s;ome of her mo&s;t judicious
partizans in England thought, that nothing would more
promote her intere&s;ts in that kingdom, than the gentle
treatment of men &s;o celebrated for their zeal again&s;t
the catholic religion; &s;he agreed to give way to her
natural temper, which inclined not to &s;everity, and
&s;he &s;eemed determined to re&s;tore them to her favour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63. Keith, p. 322.</NOTE>.
In this interval, Rambouillet arrived as amba&s;&s;ador

from France, and brought her advice from her uncle,

<P>THE two religions, in France, as well as in other
parts of Europe, were rather irritated than &s;atiated
with their mutual violences; and the peace granted
to the hugonots, as had been fore&s;een by the admiral,
was intended only to lull them a&s;leep, and prepare
the way for their final and ab&s;olute de&s;truction. The
Queen-regent made a pretence of travelling thro' the
kingdom, in order to vi&s;it the provinces, and correct
all the abu&s;es ari&s;ing from the late war; and after ha|ving
held &s;ome conferences on the frontiers with the
duke of Lorraine, and the duke of Savoy, &s;he came to
Bayonne, where &s;he was met by her daughter, the
Queen of Spain, and the duke of Alva. Nothing
appeared in the congre&s;s of the&s;e two &s;plendid courts,
but gaiety, fe&s;tivity, love, and joy; but amid&s;t the&s;e
&s;miling appearances were &s;ecretly fabricated &s;chemes
the mo&s;t bloody, and the mo&s;t de&s;tructive to the re|po&s;e
of mankind, which had ever been thought of in
any age or nation. No le&s;s than a total and univer|&s;al
extermination of the prote&s;tants by fire and &s;word,
was concerted by Philip and Catherine of Medicis;
and Alva, agreeable to his fierce and &s;anguinary di&s;po|&s;ition,
advi&s;ed the Queen-regent to commence the exe|cution
of this project, by the immediate ma&s;&s;acre of all
the leaders of the hugonots<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. iii.</NOTE> But that prince&s;s, tho'
equally hardened again&s;t every humane &s;entiment,
would not forego this opportunity of di&s;playing her
wit and re&s;ined politics; and &s;he propo&s;ed, rather by
treachery and di&s;&s;imulation, which &s;he called addre&s;s,
to lead the Prote&s;tants into the &s;nare, and never to

The cardinal of Lorraine, who&s;e character

author of this barbarous a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t the refor|mers;
and having connected his hopes of &s;ucce&s;s with
the aggrandizement of his niece, the Queen of Scots,
he took care that her mea&s;ures &s;hould agree with tho&s;e
violent councils, which were embraced by the other
catholic princes. In con&s;equence of this &s;cheme, he
turned her from the road of clemency, which &s;he in|tended
to have followed, and made her re&s;olve on
the total ruin of the bani&s;hed lords<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 63. Keith's Append. p. 176.</NOTE> A Parliament

&s;he had at fir&s;t overlooked the qualities of his
mind, which no wife corre&s;ponded with the excel|lence

his enterprizes; in&s;olent, yet credulous and ea&s;ily go|verned

She had granted him the title of King; &s;he had join|ed
his name with her own in all public acts; &s;he in|tended
to have procured him from the &s;tates a matri|monial

his weakne&s;s and vices, &s;he began to &s;ee the danger of

proceed with more re&s;erve in the tru&s;t which &s;he &s;hould

mea&s;ures and behaviour.</P>
<P>THERE was in the court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Rizzio.</NOTE> one David Rizzio who
had of late obtained a very extraordinary degree of
confidence and favour with the Queen of Scots. He
was a Piedmonte&s;e, of mean birth, &s;on to a teacher of
mu&s;ic, him&s;elf a mu&s;ician; and finding it difficult to
&s;ub&s;i&s;t by his art in his own country, he had followed
into Scotland an amba&s;&s;ador whom the duke of Sa|voy
&s;ent thither to pay his compliments to Mary,
&s;ome time after her fir&s;t arrival. He po&s;&s;&s;&s;ed a good
ear, and a tolerable voice; and as that prince&s;s found
him u&s;eful to compleat her band of mu&s;ic, &s;he re|tained
him in her &s;ervice after the departure of his
ma&s;ter. Her &s;ecretary for French di&s;patches having,
&s;ome time after, fallen under her di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he pro|moted
Rizzio to that office, which gave him frequent
opportunities of approaching her per&s;on, and in&s;inuat|ing
him&s;elf into her favour. He was &s;hrewd and
&s;en&s;ible, as well as a&s;pin$ng, much beyond his rank and
education; and made &s;o good u&s;e of the acce&s;s which
fortune had procured him, that he was &s;oon regarded
as the chief confident and even mini&s;ter of the Queen.
<PB N="98" REF="109">
He was coun&s;ulted on all occa&s;ions; no favours could
be obtained but by his interce&s;&s;ion; all &s;uitors were
obliged to gain him by pre&s;ents and flattery; and the
man, in&s;olent from his new exaltation, as well as ra|pacious
in his acqui&s;itions, &s;oon drew on him&s;elf the
hatred of the nobility, and of the whole kingdom<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 282. 302. Crawford's Memoirs, p. 5. Spot&s;wood, p. 193.</NOTE>
He had at fir&s;t employed his credit to promote Darn|ley's
marriage; and a firm friend&s;hip &s;eemed to be
e&s;tabli&s;hed between them: But on the &s;ub&s;equent
change of the Queen's &s;entiments, it was ea&s;y for
Henry's friends to per&s;uade him, that Rizzio was the
real author of her indifference, and even to rouze in
his mind jealou&s;ies of a more dangerous nature. The
favourite was of a di&s;agreeable figure, but was not
pa&s;t his youth<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Buchanan confe&s;&s;es he was ugly; but it may be inferred, from the narration of that author, that he was young. He &s;ays, that on the re|turn of the duke of Savoy to Turin, Rizzio was <HI>in adole&s;centiae vigore;</HI> in the vigour of youth. Now that event happened only a few years before. Lib. xvii. cap. 44.</NOTE>; and tho' the opinion of his criminal
corre&s;pondence with Mary might &s;eem of it&s;elf un|rea&s;onable,
if not ab&s;urd, a &s;u&s;picious hu&s;band could
find no other means of accounting for that lavi&s;h and
imprudent kindne&s;s, with which &s;he honoured him.
The rigid au&s;terity of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who could
admit of no freedoms, contriburted to &s;pread this opini|on
among the people; and as Rizzio was univer&s;al|ly
believed to be a pen&s;ionary of the pope, and to be
deeply engaged in all &s;chemes again&s;t the prote&s;tants,
any &s;tory to his and Mary's di&s;advantage, received an
ea&s;y credit among the zealots of that communion.</P>
<P>RIZZIO, who had connected his intere&s;t with the
Roman catholics, was the declared enemy of the ba|ni&s;hed
lords; and by promoting the violent pro&s;ecu|tion
<PB N="99" REF="110">
again&s;t them, had expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the animo|&s;ity
of their numerous friends and reatainers. A &s;cheme
was al&s;o thought to be formed for revoking &s;ome
exorbitant grants made during the Queen's minori|ty;
and even the nobility, who had &s;eized the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
benefices, began to think them&s;elves le&s;s
&s;ecure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 326. Melvil, p. 64.</NOTE> The earl of Mor|ton,
chancellor, was affeted by all the&s;e con&s;iderati|ons,
and &s;till more by a rumour &s;pread abroad, that
Mary intended to appoint Rizzio chancellor in his
place, and to be&s;tow that dignity on a mean and up|&s;tart
foreigner, who was ignorant of the laws and
language of the country<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Buchanan&punc; lib. xvii. c. 60. Crawford, p. 6. Spotfwood, p. 194. Knox, p. 393. Jebb, vol. J. p. 4$6.</NOTE> So indi&s;creet had this
prince&s;s been in her kindne&s;s to Rizzio, that even that
&s;trange report met with credit, and proved a great means
of accelerating the ruin of the favourite. Morton,
in&s;inuating him&s;elf into Henry's confidence, employ|ed
all his art to enflame the di&s;content and jealou&s;y of
that prince; and he per&s;uaded him, that the only
means of freeing him&s;elf from the indignities under
which be laboured, was to bring the ba&s;e &s;tranger to
that fate which he had &s;o well merited, and which
was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired by the whole nation.
George Douglas, natural brother to the counte&s;s of
Lenox, concurred in the &s;ame advice; and the lords
Ruthven and Linde&s;ey, being con&s;ulted, offered their
concurrence in the enterprize; nor was even the earl
of Lenox, the King's father, aver&s;e to the de&s;ign<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 7.</NOTE>
But as the&s;e con&s;pirators were well acquainted with
Henry's levity, they engaged him to &s;ign a paper, in
which he avowed the undertaking, and promi&s;ed to
<PB N="100" REF="111">
protect them again&s;t every con&s;equence which might
en&s;ue upon the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Rizzio<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. I. p. 266. Crawford, p. 7.</NOTE>. All the&s;e
mea&s;ures being fully concerted, a me&s;&s;enger was di&s;|patched
to the bani&s;hed lords, who were hovering
near the borders; and they were invited by the King
to return to their native country.</P>
<P>THIS de&s;ign, &s;o atrocious in it&s;elf, was rendered &s;till
more &s;o by the circum&s;tances which attended its exe|cution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th March.</NOTE> Mary, who was in the &s;ixth month of her
pregnancy, was &s;upping in private, and had at table
the counte&s;s of Argyle, her natural &s;i&s;ter, with Riz|zio,
and others of her &s;ervants. The King entered
the room by a private pa&s;&s;age, and &s;tood at the back
of Mary's chair: The lord Ruthven, George Doug|las,
and other con&s;pirators, being all armed, ru&s;hed
in after him; and the Queen of Scots, terrified with
the appearance, demanded of them the rea&s;on of this
rude intru&s;ion. They told her, that they intended
no violence again&s;t her per&s;on; but meant only to
bring that villain, pointing at Rizzio, to his de&s;erved
puni&s;hment. Rizzio, aware of the danger, ran be|hind
his mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;eizing her by the wai&s;t, called
aloud to her for protection; while &s;he interpo&s;ed in
his behalf, with cries, and menaces, and entreaties.
The impatient a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, regardle&s;s of her efforts, ru&s;h|ed
upon their prey, and by overturning every thing
which &s;tood in their way, increa&s;ed the horror and
confu&s;ion of the &s;cene. Douglas, &s;eizing Henry's
dagger, &s;tuck it in the body of Rizzio, who, &s;cream|ing
with fear and agony, was torne from Mary by the
other con&s;pirators, and pu&s;hed into the antichamber,
where he was di&s;patched with fifty-&s;ix wounds.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 64. Keith, p. 330, $31. Crawford, p. 9.</NOTE> The
unhappy prince&s;s, informed of his fate, immediately
<PB N="101" REF="112">
dried her tears, and &s;aid, &s;he would weep no more;
&s;he would now think of revenge. The in&s;ult, indeed,
upon her per&s;on; the &s;tain attempted to be fixed on
her honour; the danger to which her life was expo&s;ed,
on account of her pregnancy; were injuries &s;o atro|cious,
and &s;o complicated, that they &s;carce left room
for pardon, even from the greate&s;t lenity and mercy.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, apprehen&s;ive of Mary's te&s;entment, de|tained
her a pri&s;oner in the palace; and the King di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
all tho&s;e who &s;eemed willing to attempt her
re&s;cue, by telling them, that nothing was done with|out
his orders, and that he would be careful of the
Queen's &s;afety. Murray, and the bani&s;hed lords,
appeared two days after; and Mary, who&s;e anger was
now engro&s;&s;ed by injuries more recent and violent,
was willingly reconciled to them; and &s;he even recei|ved
he brother with tenderne&s;s and affection. They
obtained an acquital from the Parliament, and were
re-in&s;tated in their honours and fortunes. The accom|plices
al&s;o in Rizzio's murder applied to her for a par|don;
but &s;he artfully delayed compliance, and per&s;uad|ed
them, that &s;o long as &s;he was detained in cu&s;tody,
and was &s;urrounded by guards, any deed which &s;he
&s;hould &s;ign, would have no force nor validity. Mean|while
&s;he had gained the confidence of her hu&s;band,
by her per&s;ua&s;ion and care&s;&s;es; and no &s;ooner were the
guards withdrawn, than &s;he engaged him to e&s;cape
with her in the night time, and take &s;helter in Dun|bar.
Many of her &s;ubjects here offered her their a&s;&s;i&s;|tance;
and Mary, having collected an army, which
the con&s;pirators had no power to re&s;i&s;t, advanced to
Edinburgh, and obliged them to fly into England,
where they lived in great poverty and di&s;tre&s;s. They
made applications, however, to the earl of Bothwel,
a new favourite of Mary's; and that nobleman, de&s;i|&s;irous
<PB N="102" REF="113">
to &s;trengthen his party by the acce&s;&s;ion of their
intere&s;t, was able to pacify her re&s;entment, and he &s;oon
after procured them liberty to return into their own
country<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 75, 76. Keith, p. 334. Knox, p. 398.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE vengeance of the Queen of Scots was impla|cable
again&s;t her hu&s;band alone, who&s;e per&s;on was
before di&s;agreeable to her, and who, by his violation of
every tie of gratitude and duty, had now drawn on
him her highe&s;t re&s;entment. She engaged him to di&s;|own
all connections with the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, to deny any
concurrence in their crime, even to publi&s;h a procla|mation
containing a fal&s;ehood &s;o notorious to the

for him ever to acquire the confidence of any
party, &s;he threw him off with di&s;dain and indignation<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 66, 67.</NOTE>
As if &s;he had been making an e&s;cape from him, &s;he
&s;uddenly withdrew to Alloa, a &s;eat of the earl of
Mar$ and when Henry followed her thither, &s;he re|turned
&s;uddenly to Edinburgh; and gave him every
where the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of di&s;plea&s;ure, and even of
antipathy. She encouraged her courtiers in their ne|glect
of him; and &s;he was plea&s;ed, that his mean equi|page,
and &s;mall train of attendants, &s;hould draw on
him the contempt of the very populace. He was
permitted, however, to have apartments in the ca&s;tle
of Edinburgh, which Mary had cho&s;en for the place
of her delivery. She there brought forth a &s;on; and as
this was very important news to England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th June.</NOTE> as well as
to Scotland, &s;he immediately di&s;patched Sir James Mel|vil

Melvil tells us, that that prince&s;s, the evening
of his arrival in London, had given a ball to her court
<PB N="103" REF="114">
at Greenwich, and was di&s;playing all that &s;pirit and
alacrity which u&s;ually attended her on the&s;e occa&s;ions:
But when the prince of Scotland's birth was notified
to her, all her joy was damped: She &s;unk into melan|choly;
&s;he reclined her head upon her arm; and com|plained
to &s;ome of her attendants, that the Queen of
Scots was mother of a fair &s;on, while &s;he was but a bar|ren
&s;tock. Next day, however, on the reception of
the Scots amba&s;&s;ador, &s;he re&s;umed her former di&s;&s;imula|tion,
put on a joyful countenance, gave Melvil thanks
for the ha&s;te he had made in conveying to her the
agreeable intelligence, and expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t cor|diality
and friend&s;hip to her &s;i&s;ter<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 69, 70.</NOTE> Some time after
&s;he di&s;patched the earl of Bedford, with her kin&s;man

officiate at the bapti&s;m of the young prince; and &s;he
&s;ent by them &s;ome magnificent pre&s;ents to the Queen

<P>THE birth of a &s;on gave additional zeal to Mary's

began to cry aloud for &s;ome &s;ettlement of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.

in a new &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment, which was held
after &s;ix prorogations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th September. A Parliament.</NOTE> The hou&s;e of peers, which
had hitherto forborne to touch on the delicate point of

Molineux opened the matter in the lower hou&s;e, and
propo&s;ed that the que&s;tion of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and that

that, for the good of her people, &s;he was determined
to marry. Secretary Cecil and Sir Francis Knollys
gave their te&s;timony to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; as did al&s;o
Sir Ambro&s;e Cave, chancellor of the dutchy, and Sir

ambitious and ma&s;culine character was &s;o well

and it was con&s;idered merely as an artifice,
by which &s;he endeavoured to retract that po&s;itive affir|mation,
which &s;he had made in the beginning of her
reign, that &s;he meant to live and die a virgin. The
mini&s;ters therefore gained nothing farther by this piece
of policy, but only to engage the hou&s;e, for the &s;ake
of decency, to join the que&s;tion of the Queen's mar|riage
with that of a &s;ettlement of the crown; and the
commons were proceeding with great earne&s;tne&s;s in the
debate, and had even appointed a committee to confer
with the lords, when expre&s;s orders were brought them
from Elizabeth not to proceed farther in that matter.
Cecil told them, that &s;he pledged to the hou&s;e the word
of a Queen for her &s;incerity in her intentions to marry;
that the appointment of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or would be attended
with great danger to her per&s;on; that &s;he her&s;elf had
had experience, during the reign of her &s;i&s;ter, how
much court was paid to the next heir, and what dan|gerous
&s;acrifices men were commonly di&s;po&s;ed to make
of their pre&s;ent duty to their future pro&s;pects; and that

violate that profound re&s;pect which they had hitherto

<P>ELIZABETH carried farther her dignity on this occa|&s;ion.

<P>BUT tho' the Queen was able to elude, for the pre|&s;ent,

corre&s;pondence with her, and w$$e ready to ri&s;e at her
command<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Haynes. p. 446, 448.</NOTE>, the court it&s;elf of Elizabeth was full of
her avowed partizans. The duke of Norfolk, the
earls of Leice&s;ter, Pembroke, Bedford, Northumber|land,
Sir Nicholas Throcmorton, and mo&s;t of the con|&s;iderable
men in England, except Cecil, &s;eemed con|vinced
of the nece&s;&s;ity of declaring her the &s;ucce&s;&s;or.
None but the more zealous prote&s;tants adhered either
to the counte&s;s of Hertford, or to her aunt, Eleanor,
Counte&s;s of Cumberland; and as the marriage of the
former &s;eemed liable to &s;ome objections, and had been
declared invalid, men were alarmed, even on that &s;ide,
with the pro&s;pect of new di&s;putes concerning the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Mary's behaviour al&s;o, &s;o moderate to|wards
the prote&s;tants, and &s;o gracious towards all men,
had procured her univer&s;al re&s;pect<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 53, 61, 74.</NOTE>; and the public
was willing to a&s;cribe any imprudences, into which
&s;he had fallen, to her youth and inexperience. But all
the&s;e flattering pro&s;pects were bla&s;ted by the &s;ub&s;e|quent
incidents, where her engregious indi&s;cretions,
&s;hall I &s;ay, or atrocious crimes, threw her from the
height of her pro&s;perity, and involved her in infamy
and ruin.</P>
<P>THE earl of Bothwel was of a con&s;iderable family
and power in Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Darnley.</NOTE> and tho' not di&s;tingui&s;hed$ by
any talents either of a civil or military nature, he had
made a figure in that party, which oppo&s;ed the great|ne&s;s
of the earl of Murray, and the more rigid refor|mers.
He was a man of profligate manners; had in|volved
his opulent fortune in great debts, and even re|duced
him&s;elf to beggary, by his profu&s;e expences<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 240.</NOTE>;
and &s;eemed to have no re&s;ource but in de&s;perate coun|cils
and enterprizes. He had been accu&s;ed more

on all &s;ides dimini&s;h &s;omewhat the credit due to
any particular imputation, they prove &s;ufficiently the
prevalence of that dete&s;table practice in Scotland, and
may in that view &s;erve to render &s;uch rumours the
more likely and credible. This man had of late acqui|red
the favour and entire confidence of Mary; and all
her mea&s;ures were directed by his advice and authori|ty.
Reports were &s;pread of more particular intima|cies
and familiarities between them; and the&s;e reports
gained ground from the continuance or rather encrea&s;e
of her hatred towards her hu&s;band<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 66. 77.</NOTE> That young

that occa&s;ion, and to have embraced the propo&s;al no
farther than it &s;hould be found con&s;i&s;tent with her own
honour and her &s;on's legitimacy<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 404. Goodal's Queen Mary, vol. II. p. 317.</NOTE>, men were inclined
to believe, that the difficulty of finding proper means
for effectuating that purpo&s;e, was the real cau&s;e of
laying a&s;ide all farther thoughts of it. So far were
the &s;u&s;picions again&s;t her carried, that, when Henry,
di&s;couraged with the continual proofs of her hatred,
left the court and retired to Gla&s;gow, an illne&s;s of an
extraordinary nature, with which he was &s;eized imme|diately
on his arrival in that place, was univer&s;ally
a&s;cribed by her enemies to a do&s;e of poi&s;on, which, it
was pretended, &s;he had admini&s;tred to him.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="120">
WHILE affairs were on this footing, all tho&s;e who
wi&s;hed well to her character or the repo&s;e of their coun|try,
were extremely plea&s;ed, and &s;omewhat &s;urprized,
to hear, that a friend&s;hip was again conciliated be|tween
them, that &s;he had taken a journey to Gla&s;gow
on purpo&s;e to vi&s;it him during his &s;ickne&s;s, that &s;he
behaved towards him with great tenderne&s;s, that &s;he
had brought him along with her, and that &s;he appeared
thenceforth determined to live with him on a footing
more &s;uitable to the connexions between them. Hen|ry,
naturally uxorious, and not mi&s;tru&s;ting this &s;ud|den
reconcilement, put him&s;elf implicitly into her
hands, and attended her to Edinburgh. She lived in
the palace of Holy-rood-hou&s;e; but as the &s;ituation
of that place was low, and the concour&s;e of per&s;ons
about the court was nece&s;&s;arily attended with noi&s;e,
which might di&s;turb him in his pre&s;ent infirm &s;tate of
health, the&s;e rea&s;ons were a&s;&s;igned for fitting up an
apartment for him in a &s;olitary hou&s;e, at &s;ome di&s;tance,
called the Kirk of Field. Mary here gave him marks
of kindne&s;s and attachment; &s;he conver&s;ed cordially
with him; and &s;he lay &s;ome nights in a room below
his; but on the ninth of February, &s;he told him, that
&s;he would pa&s;s that night in the palace, becau&s;e the mar|riage
of one of her &s;ervants was there to be celebrated
in her pre&s;ence. About two o'clock in the morning
the whole town was much alarmed at hearing a great
noi&s;e; and were &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed, when it was di&s;|covered,
that the noi&s;e came from the King's hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Febru|ary.</NOTE>
which was blown up by gun-powder; that his dead bo|dy
was found at &s;ome di&s;tance in a neighbouring field;
and that no marks either of fire, contu&s;ion or violence
appeared upon it<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">It was imagined, that Henry had been &s;trangled before the hou&s;e was blown up: But this &s;uppo&s;ition is contradicted by the confe&s;&s;ion of the cri|minals; and there is no nece&s;&s;ity to admit it in order to account for the con|dition of his body. There are many in&s;tances that men's lives have been! &s;aved who have been blown up in &s;hips. Had Henry fallen on water he had not probably been killed</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="121">
No doubt could be entertained but Henry was mur|dered; and the general conjecture &s;oon pointed to|wards
the earl of Bothwel as the author of that crime<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 78. Cabbala, p. 136.</NOTE>.
But as his favour with Mary was open and vi&s;ible,
and his power great, no one ventured to declare open|ly
his &s;entiments, and all men remained in &s;ilence and
mute a&s;toni&s;hment. Voices, however, were heard in
the &s;treets, during the darkne&s;s of the night, proclaim|ing
Bothwel, and even Mary her&s;elf, to be the murder|ers
of the King; placards were &s;ecretly affixed on the
walls to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; offers were made, that,
upon giving proper &s;ecurities, his guilt &s;hould be open|ly
proved: But after one proclamation from the court,
offering a reward and indemnity to any one that would
di&s;cover the author of that villainy, greater vigilance
was employed in &s;earching out the &s;preaders of the li|bels

in tracing the cau&s;es of the King's murder, or detect|ing
the regicides<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on's Collections vol. II. p. 38. vol $word$. p$ 167, 168. Spot&s;wood, p. 200. Keith, p. 374.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE earl of Lenox, who lived at a di&s;tance from
the court, in poverty and contempt, was rouzed by
the report of the &s;on's murder, and wrote to the Queen,
imploring &s;peedy ju&s;tice again&s;t the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; among
whom he named the earl of Bothwel, Sir James Bal|four,
and $word$ Balfour his other, David Chal|mers,

and allowing only fifteen days for the examination of
this important affair, &s;he &s;ent a citation to Lenox, re|quiring

and all the other per&s;ons, accu&s;ed by Lenox, enjoyed
their full liberty<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 374. 375.</NOTE>; Bothwel him&s;elf was continually
&s;urrounded with armed men<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 405.</NOTE>; took his place in coun|cil<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. I. p. 38, 40, 50, 52.</NOTE>; lived during &s;ome time in the hou&s;e with Mary<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. II. p. 274.</NOTE>;
and &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s all his wonted confidence and
familiarity with her. Even the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh,
a place of great con&s;equence, in this critical time, was
entru&s;ted to his creature, Sir James Balfour, who had
him&s;elf been publickly charged as an accomplice in
the King's murder<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 201.</NOTE>. Lenox, who had come as far
as Stirling, with a view of appearing at the trial, was
informed of all the&s;e circum&s;tances; and reflecting
on the &s;mall train, which attended him, he began to
entertain very ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions from the power, in&s;o|lence,
and temerity of his ememy. He wrote to Mary,
de&s;iring that the day of trial might be prorogued; and
conjured her, by all the regard which &s;he bore to her
own honour, to employ more lei&s;ure and deliberation
in determining a que&s;tion of &s;uch extreme moment<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Keith p. 375. Ander&s;on, vol. I. p. 52.</NOTE>.
No regard was paid to his application: The jury was

interpretation generally put upon this error, too gro&s;s,
it was thought, to have proceeded from mi&s;take, was,
that the &s;ecret council by whom Mary was governed,
not tru&s;ting entirely to precipitation, violence, and
authoity, had provided this plea, by which they en|&s;ured,
at all adventures, a plau&s;ible pretence for acquit|ing

<P>Two days after this extraordinary tran&s;action, a Parli|ament
was held; and tho' the &s;entence in favour of Both|wel
was attended with &s;uch circum&s;tances as &s;trongly

again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;et up defamatory placards; but no
notice was taken of the King's murder<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 380. The Queen, in order to gain the people, agreed to an act of Parliament, which e&s;tabli&s;hed the prote&s;tant religion; a conce&s;&s;ion which &s;he could never be|fore be brought to make.</NOTE> The fa|vour,
which Mary openly bore to Bothwel, kept eve|ry
one in awe; and the effects of this terror appeared
more plainly in another tran&s;action, which en&s;ued im|mediately

<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent mea&s;ures of Bothwel were equal|ly
precipitate and audacious. Mary having gone to
Stirling to pay a vi&s;it to her &s;on, he a&s;&s;embled a bo|dy
of eight hundred hor&s;e, on pretence of pur&s;uing
&s;ome robbers on the borders, and having way laid her
on her return, he &s;eized her per&s;on near Edinburgh,
<PB N="114" REF="127">
and carried her to Dunbar, with an avowed de&s;ign of
forcing her to yield to his purpo&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> Sir James Mel|vil,
who was in her retinue, was carried along with
her; and &s;ays not, that he &s;aw any &s;igns of reluc|tance

us by Bothwel's officers, that the whole tran&s;action
was managed in concert with her<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 80.</NOTE>. A woman, in|deed,
of that &s;pirit and re&s;olution, which is acknow|ledged

occa&s;ions, give &s;uch marks of oppo&s;ition to <HI>real</HI> vio|lence,
as can appear anywi&s;e doubtful or ambiguous.
Some of the nobility, however, in order to put mat|ters
to farther trial, &s;ent her a private me&s;&s;age; in
which they told her, that, if in reality &s;he lay under
force, they would u&s;e all their efforts to relieve her.
Her an&s;wer was, that &s;he had indeed been carried to
Dunbar by violence, but &s;ince her arrival had been &s;o

Bothwel<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 202.</NOTE> No one gave them&s;elves thenceforth any
&s;olicitude to relieve her from a captivity, which they
believed to have proceeded entirely from her own ap|probation
and connivance.</P>
<P>THIS unu&s;ual conduct was fir&s;t a&s;cribed to Mary's
&s;en&s;e of the infamy, attending her purpo&s;ed marriage;
and her de&s;ire of finding &s;ome colour to glo&s;s over
the irregularity of her conduct. But a pardon given
to Bothwel a few days afterwards, made the public
carry &s;omewhat farther their conjectures. In this deed,
Bothwel received a pardon for the violence committed
on the Queen's per&s;on; and for <HI>all other crimes:</HI> A
clau&s;e, by which the murder of the King was indi|rectly
pardoned. The rape was then conjectured to
have been only a contrivance of the&s;e politicians, in

<P>THESE events pa&s;&s;ed with &s;uch rapidity, that men
had no lei&s;ure to admire &s;ufficiently one incident, when
they were &s;urprized with a new one, equally rare
and uncommon. There &s;till, however, remained one
difficulty, which, it was not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, how the
Queen and Bothwel, determined as they were to exe|cute
their &s;hameful purpo&s;e, could find expedients to
overcome. The man, who had procured the &s;ub&s;crip|tion
of the nobility, recommending him as a hu&s;band
to the Queen, and who had acted this &s;eeming violence
on her per&s;on, in order to force her con&s;ent, had been
married &s;ix months before to another woman; to a
woman of merit, of a very noble family, &s;i&s;ter to the
earl of Huntley. But per&s;ons blinded with pa&s;&s;ion,
and infatuated with crimes, &s;oon &s;hake off all appear|ance
of decency. A &s;uit was commenced for a divorce
between Bothwel and his wife; and this &s;uit was open|ed
at the &s;ame in&s;tant in two different, or rather oppo|&s;ite
courts; in the court of the archbi&s;hop of St.
Andrews, which was popi&s;h, and governed it&s;elf by
the canon law; and in the new con&s;i&s;torial or commi&s;&s;|ariot
court, which was prote&s;tant, and was regulated
by the principles of the reformed teachers. The plea
advanced in each court, was &s;o calculated as to &s;uit
the principles which there prevailed: In the archbi|&s;hop's
court, the pretence of con&s;anguinity was em|ployed,
becau&s;e Bothwel was related to his wife in the
fourth degree; in the commi&s;&s;ariot court, the accu&s;a|tion
of adultery was made u&s;e of again&s;t him. The
parties too who applied for the divorce, were different
in the different courts: Bothwel was the per&s;on who
&s;ued in the former; his wife in the latter. And the
&s;uit in both courts was opened, pleaded, examined,
<PB N="116" REF="129">
and decided with the utmo&s;t precipitation, and a &s;en|tence
of divorce was pronounced in four days<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. p. 280.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE divorce being thus obtained, it was thought
proper that Mary &s;hould be conducted to Edinburgh,
and &s;hould there appear before the courts of judica|ture,
and &s;hould acknowledge her&s;elf to be re&s;tored to
entire freedom. This was under&s;tood to be contrived
with a view of obviating all doubts with regard to
the validity of her marriage. Orders were then gi|ven
to publi&s;h the banns in the church, between the
Queen and the duke of Orkney; for that was the ti|tle
which he now bore; and Craig, a mini&s;ter of Edin|burgh,
was applied to for that purpo&s;e. This clergy|man,
not content with having, for &s;ome time, refu&s;ed
compliance, publicly in his &s;ermons condemned the
marriage; and exhorted all tho&s;e who had acce&s;s to
the Queen, to give her their advice again&s;t &s;o &s;can|dalous
an alliance. Being called before the coun|cil,
to an&s;wer for this liberty, he &s;howed a courage
which might cover all the nobles with &s;hame, on ac|count
of their tamene&s;s and &s;ervility. He &s;aid, that,
by the rules of the church, the earl of Bothwel, be|ing
convicted of adultery, could not be permitted to
marry; that the divorce between him and his former
wife, was plainly procured by collu&s;ion, as appeared
by the precipitation of that &s;entence, and the &s;udden
conclu&s;ion of his marriage with the Queen; and that
all the &s;u&s;picions which prevailed, with regard to the
King's murder, and the Queen's concurrence in the
former rape, would thence receive undoubted confir|mation.
He therefore exhorted Bothwel, who was
pre&s;ent, no longer to per&s;evere in his pre&s;ent crimi|nal
enterprizes; and turning his di&s;cour&s;e to the other
coun&s;ellors, he charged them to employ all their influ|ence
with the Queen, in order to divert her from a
<PB N="117" REF="130">
mea&s;ure which would cover her with infamy and di&s;|honour. Not &s;atisfied even with this admonition, he
took the fir&s;t opportunity of informing the public,
from the pulpit, of this whole tran&s;action, and expre&s;&s;|ed
to them his fears, that, notwith&s;tanding all remon|&s;trances,
their &s;overeign was &s;till ob&s;tinately bent on
her &s;atal purpo&s;e &startq;For him&s;elf,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;he had
already di&s;charged his con&s;cience, and yet again
would take heaven and earth to witne&s;s, that he
abhorred and dete&s;ted that marriage, as &s;candalous
and hateful in the &s;ight of mankind; But &s;ince
the Great, as he perceived, either by their flattery
or &s;ilence, gave countenance to the mea&s;ure, he be|&s;ought
the Faithful to pray fervently to the Al|mighty,
that a re&s;olution, which was taken contrary to
all law, rea&s;on, and good con&s;cience, might, by the
divine ble&s;&s;ing, be turned to the comfort and benefit
of the church and kingdom.&endq; The&s;e &s;peeches of|fended
the court extremely; and Craig was anew &s;um|moned
before the council, to an&s;wer for his temerity
in thus pa&s;&s;ing the bounds of his commi&s;&s;ion. But
he told them, that the bounds of his commi&s;&s;ion
were the word of God, good laws, and natural rea&s;on;
and were the Queen's marriage tried by any of the&s;e
three &s;tandards, it would appear infamous and di&s;ho|nourable,
and would be &s;o e&s;teemed by the whole
world. The council were &s;o overawed by this heroic
behaviour in a private clergyman, that they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
him without farther cen&s;ure or puni&s;hment.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">I Spot&s;wood, p. 203. Ander&s;on, vol. II. p. 280.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this tran&s;action might have recalled Both|wel
and the Queen of Scots, from their infatuation,
and might have in&s;tructed them in the di&s;po&s;itions of
the people, as well as in their own inability to oppo&s;e
them; they were &s;till re&s;olute to ru&s;h forward to
their own manife&s;t de&s;truction.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 May.</NOTE> The marriage was
<PB N="118" REF="131">
&s;olemnized by the bi&s;hop of Orkney, a prote&s;tant,
who was afterwards depo&s;ed by the church for this
&s;candalous compliance. Few of the nobility appear|ed
at the ceremony; they had mo&s;t of them, either
from &s;hame or fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">51 May.</NOTE> retired to their own hou&s;es. The
French amba&s;&s;ador,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen of Scots mar|ries Bothwel.</NOTE> Le Croc, an aged gentleman of

opinion.</P>
<P>THE news of the&s;e tran&s;actions, being carried to
foreign countries, filled all Europe with amazement,
and threw infamy not only on the principal actors in
them, but al&s;o on the whole nation, who &s;eemed, by
their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and &s;ilence, and even by their declared
approbation, to give their &s;anction to the&s;e &s;candalous
practices<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p 82. Keith, p. 402. Ander&s;on, vol. I. 128, 134.</NOTE>. The Scots, who re&s;ided abroad, met with
&s;uch reproaches, that they dru&s;t no where appear in
public; and they earne&s;tly exhorted their countrymen
at home, to free them from the public odium, by
bringing to condign puni&s;hment the authors of &s;uch
atrocious crimes. This intelligence, with a little
more lei&s;ure for reflection, rou&s;ed men at la&s;t from
their lethargy; and the rumours, which, from the very
beginning<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 11. Keith, Pref. p. 9.</NOTE>, had been &s;pread again&s;t Mary, as if &s;he
had concurred in the King's murder, &s;eemed now, by
the &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;actions, to have received a &s;trong
confirmation and authority. It was every where &s;aid,
that, even tho' no particular and direct proofs had as
<PB N="119" REF="132">
yet been produced of the Queen's guilt, the whole
tenor of her late conduct was &s;ufficient, not only to
beget &s;u&s;picion, but to prudce entire conviction again&s;t
her: That her &s;udden re&s;olution of being reconciled
to her hu&s;band, whom before &s;he had long and ju&s;tly
hated; her bringing him to court, from which &s;he had
bani&s;hed him by neglects and rigours; her fitting up
&s;eparate apartments for him; were all of them circum|&s;tances,
which, tho' trivial in them&s;elves, yet, being
compared with the following events, bore a very un|favourable
a&s;pect for her: That the lea&s;t which, after
the King's murder, might have been expected in her
&s;ituation, was a more than u&s;ual caution in her mea|&s;ures,
and an extreme anxiety to puni&s;h the real
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, in order to free her&s;elf from all reproach and
&s;u&s;picion: That no woman, who had any regard to
her character, would allow a man, publickly accu&s;ed
of her hu&s;band's murder, &s;o much as to approach her
pre&s;ence, far le&s;s give him a &s;hare in her councils, and
cndow him with favour and authority: That an acquital
merely in the ab&s;ence of accu&s;ers was very ill fitted to &s;a|tisfy
the public; e&s;pecially if that ab&s;ence proceeded from
a de&s;igned precipitation of the &s;entence, and from the ter|ror
which her known friend&s;hip for the criminal had in|fu&s;ed
into every one: That the very mention of her
marriage to &s;uch a per&s;on, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, was
horrible; and the contrivances of extorting a con&s;ent
of the nobility, and of concerting a rape, were gro&s;s
artifices, more proper to di&s;cover her guilt than prove
her innocence: That where a woman thus &s;hews a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of merited reproach, and, in&s;tead of cor|recting,
provides only thin glo&s;&s;es to cover her excep|tionable
conduct, &s;he betrays a neglect of fame, which
mu&s;t either be the effect or the cau&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;hame|ful
enormities: That to e&s;pou&s;e a man, who had a
few days before been &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly divorced from his
wife; who, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, was believed to have, a
few months before, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated her hu&s;band, was &s;o
<PB N="120" REF="133">
contrary to the plaine&s;t rules of behaviour, that no pre|tence
of indi&s;cretion or imprudence could account for
&s;uch a conduct: That a woman, who, &s;o &s;oon after
her hu&s;band's death, tho' not attended with any ex|traordinary
circum&s;tances, contracts a marriage which
might, in it&s;elf, be the mo&s;t blamele&s;s, cannot, e&s;cape
&s;evere cen&s;ure; but one who overlooks, for her plea|&s;ure,
&s;o many other weighty con&s;iderations, was
equally capable, in gratifying her appetites, to neglect
every regard to honour, and to humanity: That Mary
was not ignorant of the prevailing opinion of the pub|lic,
with regard to her own guilt, and of the inferences
which would every where be drawn from her conduct;
and therefore, if &s;he &s;till continued to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures
which gave &s;uch ju&s;t offence, &s;he ratified, by her acti|ons,
as much as by the mo&s;t formal confe&s;&s;ion, all the
&s;urmizes and imputations of her enemies: That the
only circum&s;tance which oppo&s;ed all the&s;e pre&s;ump|tions,
was, the benignity and goodne&s;s of her preced|ing
behaviour, which &s;eemed to remove her from all
&s;u&s;picion of &s;uch atrocious inhumanity; but that the
characters of men were extremely variable, and the
per&s;ons who were guilty of the wor&s;t actions, were
not always naturally of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t criminal
di&s;po&s;itions; That a woman, who, in a critical and
dangerous moment, had &s;acrificed her honour to a man
of abandoned principles, might thenceforth be led
blindfold by him to the commi&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t enor|mous
crimes, and was in reality no longer at her own
di&s;po&s;al: And that tho' one &s;uppo&s;ition was &s;till left
to alleviate her blame, viz. that Bothwel, pre&s;um|ing
on her affection towards him, had of him&s;elf com|mitted
the crime, and had never communicated it to
her, yet &s;uch a &s;udden and pa&s;&s;ionate love to a man
whom &s;he had long known, could not ea&s;ily be ac|counted
for, without &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome degree of preced|ing
guilt; and as it appeared that &s;he was not after|wards
<PB N="121" REF="134">
re&s;trained, either by &s;hame or prudence, from
incurring the highe&s;t reproach and danger, it was not
likely, that a &s;en&s;e of duty or humanity would have a
more powerful influence over her.</P>
<P>THESE were the &s;entiments which prevailed through|out
Scotland; and as the prote&s;tant teachers, who had
great authority, had long borne a great animo&s;ity to|wards
Mary, the opinion of her guilt was, by that
means, the more widely diffu&s;ed, and made the deeper
impre&s;&s;ion on every one. Some attempts made by
Bothwel, and, as it pretended, with her con&s;ent,
to get the young prince into his power, excited the
mo&s;t &s;erious attention; and the principal nobility, even
many of tho&s;e who had formerly been con&s;trained to
&s;ign the application in favour of Bothwel's marriage,
met at Stirling, and formed an a&s;&s;ociation for protect|ing
the prince, and puni&s;hing the Kings murderers<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 394</NOTE>.
The earl of Athole him&s;elf, a known catholic was
the fir&s;t author of this confederacy: The earls of Ar|gyle,
Morton, Mar, Glencarne, the lords Boyd,
Linde&s;ey, Hume, Semple, Kirkaldy of Grange, Tul|libardine,
and &s;ecretary Lidington, entered zealou&s;ly
into it. The earl of Murray, fore&s;eeing &s;uch turbu|lent
times, and being de&s;irous to keep free of the&s;e
dangerous factions, had, &s;ome time before, de&s;ired
and obtained Mary's permi&s;&s;ion to retire into France.</P>
<P>LORD Hume was fir&s;t in arms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrecti|ons in Scot|land.</NOTE> and leading a body
of eight hundred hor&s;e, &s;uddenly invironed the Queen
of Scots and Bothwel, in the ca&s;tle of Borthwic. They
found means to make their e&s;cape to Dunbar; while
the confederate lords were a&s;&s;embling their troops at
Edinburgh, and taking mea&s;ures to effectuate their
purpo&s;e. Had Bothwel been &s;o prudent as to keep
within the forte&s;s of Dunbar, his enemies mu&s;t have
been di&s;&s;ipated for want of pay and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th June.</NOTE> but
hearing that the lords were fallen into di&s;tre&s;s, he was
<PB N="122" REF="135">
&s;o ra&s;h as to take the field, and advance towards them.
The armies met at Carberry Hill, about &s;ix miles from
Edinburgh; and Mary became &s;oon &s;en&s;ible, that her
own troops di&s;approved of her cau&s;e, and were aver&s;e
to &s;pend their blood in the quarrel<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 402. Spot&s;wood, p. 207.</NOTE> After &s;ome bra|va
does of Bothwel, where he di&s;covered very little
courage, &s;he &s;aw no re&s;ource but that of holding a
conference with Kirkaldy of Grange, and of putting
her&s;elf, upon &s;ome general promi&s;es, into the hands of
the confederates. She was conducted to Edinburgh,
amid&s;t the in&s;ults of the populace, who reproached her
with her crimes, and even held before her eyes, which
ever way &s;he turned, a banner, on which was painted
the murder of her hu&s;band, and the di&s;tre&s;s of her in|fant
&s;on<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 83, 84.</NOTE> Mary, overwhelmed with her calamities,
had recour&s;e to tears and lamentations. Mean while
Bothwel, during her conference with Grange, fled un|attended
to Dunbar; and fitting out a few &s;mall &s;hips,
&s;et &s;ail for the Orkneys, where he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted during &s;ome
time by pyracy. He was pur&s;ued thither by Grange,
and his &s;hip was taken, with &s;everal of his &s;ervants,
who afterwards di&s;covered all the circum&s;tances of the
King's murder, and were puni&s;hed for the crime<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. p. 165, 166, &amp;c.</NOTE>
Bothwel him&s;elf e&s;caped in a boat, and found means to
get a pa&s;&s;age to Denmark, where he was thrown into
pri&s;on, lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and died mi&s;erably about ten
years afterwards: An end worthy of his flagitious con|duct
and behaviour.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impri&s;on|ment of Mary.</NOTE>, now in the hands of an en|raged
faction, met with &s;uch treatment as a &s;overeign
may naturally expect from &s;ubjects who have their future

to gratify. It is pretended, that &s;he behaved with a
&s;pirit very little &s;uitable to her condition, avowed her
inviolable attachment to Bothwel<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 419.</NOTE>, and even wrote
him a letter, which the lords intercepted, where &s;he
declared, that &s;he would endure any extremity,
<PB N="123" REF="136">
nay, re&s;ign her dignity and power, rather than relin|qui&s;h
his affections<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 84. The reality of this letter appears &s;omewhat di&s;put|able; chiefly becau&s;e Murray and his a&s;&s;ociates never mentioned it in their accu&s;ation of her before Queen Elizabeth's commi&s;&s;ioners.</NOTE> The malecontents finding the
danger to which they were expo&s;ed, in ca&s;e Mary &s;hould
finally prevail, thought them&s;elves obliged to proceed
with rigour again&s;t her; and they &s;ent her next day
under a guard to the ca&s;tle of Lochlevin, &s;ituated in a
lake of that name. The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e was mo|ther
to the earl of Murray; and as &s;he pretended to
have been lawfully married to the late King of
Scots, &s;he naturally bore an animo&s;ity to Mary,
and treated her with the utmo&s;t har&s;hne&s;s and
&s;everity.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who was exactly informed of all tho&s;e
events, &s;eemed touched with compa&s;&s;ion rowards the
unfortunate Queen; and all her fears and jealou&s;ies
being now laid a&s;leep, by the con&s;ideration of that ruin
and infamy in which Mary's conduct had involved
her, &s;he began to reflect on the in&s;tability of human
affairs, the precarious &s;tate of royal grandeur, the dan|ger
of encouraging rebellious &s;ubjects; and &s;he re&s;olved
to employ her authority for alleviating the calamities
of her unhappy &s;i&s;ter. She &s;ent Sir Nicholas Throc|morton
amba&s;&s;ador to Scotland, in order to remon&s;trate
both with Mary and the a&s;&s;ociated lords; and &s;he gave
him in&s;tructions which, tho' mixt with &s;ome lofty pre|ten&s;ions,
were full of that good &s;en&s;e which was &s;o
natural to her, and of that genero&s;ity which the pre|&s;ent
intere&s;ting &s;ituation had called forth. She em|powered
him to declare in her name to Mary, that the
late conduct of that prince&s;s, &s;o enormous, and in
every re&s;pect &s;o unju&s;tifiable, had given her the highe&s;t
offence; and tho' &s;he felt the movements of pity to|wards
her, &s;he had once determined never to interpo&s;e
in her affairs, either by advice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but to
<PB N="124" REF="137">
abandon her entirely, as a per&s;on who&s;e condition was
totally de&s;perate, and honour irretrieveable: That
&s;he was well a&s;&s;ured, that other foreign princes,
Mary's near relations, had embraced the &s;ame re&s;olu|tion;
but, for her part, the late events had touched
her heart with more tender &s;ympathy, and had made
her adopt mea&s;ures more favourable to the liberty and
intere&s;ts of the unhappy Queen: That &s;he was de|termined
not to &s;ee her oppre&s;&s;ed by her rebellious &s;ub|jects,
but would employ all her good offices, and even
her power, to redeem her from captivity, and place her
in &s;uch a condition as would at once be compatible
with her dignity, and the &s;afety of her &s;ubjects: That
&s;he entreated her to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of revenge,
except again&s;t the murderers of her hu&s;band; and as
&s;he her&s;elf was his near relation, &s;he was better entitled
than the &s;ubjects of Mary to interpo&s;e her authority on
that head, and &s;he therefore be&s;ought that prince&s;s, if
&s;he had any regard to her own honour and &s;afety, not
to oppo&s;e &s;o ju&s;t and rea&s;onable a demand: That after
tho&s;e two points were provided for, her own liberty,
and the puni&s;hment of her hu&s;band's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, the &s;afety
of her infant &s;on was next to be con&s;idered; and there
&s;eemed no expedient more proper for that purpo&s;e, than
the &s;ending him to be educated in England: And that,
be&s;ides the &s;ecurity which would attend his removal
from all factions and convul&s;ions, there were many
other beneficial con&s;equences, which it was ea&s;y to
fore&s;ee as the re&s;ult of his education in that coun|try<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 411, 412, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE remon&s;trances which Throcmorton was in|&s;tructed
to make to the a&s;&s;ociated lords, were entirely
conformable to the&s;e &s;entiments which Elizabeth enter|tained
in Mary's favour. She empowered him to tell
them, that whatever blame &s;he might throw on Mary's
conduct, any oppo&s;ition to their &s;overeign was totally
<PB N="125" REF="138">
unju&s;tifiable, and incompatible with all order and
good government: That it belonged not to them to
reform, much le&s;s to puni&s;h, the mal-admini&s;tration
of their prince; and the only arms which &s;ubjects could
in any ca&s;e lawfully employ again&s;t the &s;upreme autho|rity,
were entr$aties, coun&s;els, and repre&s;entations:
That if the&s;e expedients failed, they were next to ap|peal
by their prayers to Heaven; and to wait with pa|tience
till the Almighty, in who&s;e hands are the hearts
of princes, &s;hould be plea&s;ed to turn them to ju&s;tice
and to mercy. That &s;he inculcated not this doctrine
becau&s;e &s;he her&s;elf was intere&s;ted in its ob&s;ervance;
but becau&s;e it was univer&s;ally received in all well go|verned
&s;tates, and was e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of
civil &s;ociety: That &s;he required them to re&s;tore their
Queen to liberty; and promi&s;ed, in that ca&s;e, to con|cur
with them in all proper expedients for regulating
the government, for puni&s;hing the King's murderers,
and for guarding the life and liberty of the infant
prince: And that if the &s;ervices which &s;he had lately
conferred on the Scoti&s;h nation, in protecting them
from foreign u&s;urpation, were duly con&s;idered by them,
they would repo&s;e confidence in her good offices, and
would e&s;teem them&s;elves blame-worthy, in never hav|ing
as yet made any application to her<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 414, 415, 429.</NOTE></P>

he was to propo&s;e to both parties, as expedients for
the &s;ettlement of public affairs; and tho' the&s;e articles
included &s;ome con&s;iderable re&s;traints on the &s;ove|reign
power, they were in the main calculated for
Mary's advantage, and were &s;ufficiently indulgent to
her<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 416.</NOTE> The a&s;&s;ociated lords, who were determined to
proceed with greater &s;everity, were apprehen&s;ive of
Elizabeth's partiality; and being &s;en&s;ible, that Ma|ry
would take courage from the protection of that
<PB N="126" REF="139">
powerful prince&s;s<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 427.</NOTE>, they thought proper, after &s;eve|ral
affected delays, to refu&s;e the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador
all acce&s;s to her per&s;on. There were four differ|ent
&s;chemes propo&s;ed in Scotland, for the treatment
of the captive Queen: One, that &s;he &s;hould be re|&s;tored
to her authority under very &s;trict limitations;
The &s;econd, that &s;he &s;hould be obliged to re&s;ign her
crown to the prince, be bani&s;hed the kingdom, and
be confined either to France or England; with a&s;&s;ur|ances
from the &s;overeign in who&s;e dominions &s;he
&s;hould re&s;ide, that &s;he &s;hould make no attempts to
the di&s;turbance of the e&s;tabli&s;hed government: The
third, that &s;he &s;hould be publickly treid for her crimes,
of which her enemies pretended to have undoubted
proofs, and be condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment:
The fourth was &s;till more &s;evere, and required
that, after her condemnation, capital puni&s;hment
&s;hould be inflicted upon her<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 420.</NOTE> Throcmorton &s;up|ported
the milde&s;t propo&s;al; but tho' he promi&s;ed his
mi&s;tre&s;s's guarantee for the performance of articles,
threatned them with immediate vengeance in ca&s;e of
refu&s;al<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 428.</NOTE>, and warned them not to draw on them
&s;elves, by their violence, the public reproach, which
now lay upon the Queen; he found, that except|ing
&s;ecretary Lidington, he had not the good for
tune to convince any of the leaders. All councils
&s;eemed to tend towards the more &s;evere expedients;
and the preachers, in particular, drawing their ex|amples
from the rigorous maxims of the Old Te&s;ta|ment,
which can only be warranted by particular re|velations,
inflamed the minds of the people again&s;t
their unhappy &s;overeign<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 422, 426.</NOTE></P>
<P>THERE were &s;everal pretenders to the regency of
the young prince, after the intended depo&s;ition of
Mary. The earl of Lenox claimed that authority as
<PB N="127" REF="140">
grandfather to the prince: The duke of Chatelraut,
who was ab&s;ent in France, had preten&s;ions as next
heir to the crown: But the greate&s;t number of the a&s;&s;o|ciated
lords inclined to the earl of Murray, in who&s;e
capacity they had the greate&s;t tru&s;t, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
the entire confidence of the preachers and more
zealous reformers. All mea&s;ures being therefore con|certed,
three in&s;truments were &s;ent to Mary, by the
hands of Lord Linde&s;ey and Sir Robert Melvil; by
one of which &s;he was to re&s;ign the crown in favour
of her &s;on, by another to appoint Murray regent, by
the third to name a Council, which &s;hould admini&s;ter
the government till his arrival in Scotland. The
Queen of Scots, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of relief, lying
ju&s;tly under apprehen&s;ions of her life, and believing,
that no deed, which &s;he executed during her capti|vity,
could be valid, was prevailed on, after a plenti|ful
effu&s;ion of tears, to &s;ign the&s;e three in&s;truments;
and &s;he took not the trouble of in&s;pecting any one
of them<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 85. Spot&s;wood, p. 211. Ander&s;on, vol. III. p. 19.</NOTE> In con&s;equence of this forced re&s;ignation,
the young prince was proclaimed King, under the
name of James the &s;ixth. He was &s;oon after crown|ed
at Stirling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th July.</NOTE> and the earl of Morton took in his
name the coronation-oath; in which a promi&s;e to ex|tirpate
here&s;y was not forgot. Some republican pre|ten&s;ions
in favour of the people's power were coun|tenanced
in this ceremony<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 439, 440.</NOTE>; and a coin was &s;oon
&s;truck, on which the famous &s;aying of Trajan was in|&s;cribed,
<HI>Pro me; &s;i merear, in me:</HI> For me; if I de|&s;erve
it, again&s;t me<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 440. Appen. p. 150.</NOTE> Throcmorton had orders from
his mi&s;tre&s;s not to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the coronation of the King
of Scots<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 430.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE council of regency had not long occa&s;ion to
exerci&s;e their authority, The earl of Murray arrived
<PB N="128" REF="141">
from France, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his high office.
He paid a vi&s;it to the captive Queen; and &s;poke to
her in a manner which better &s;uited her pa&s;t con|duct
than her pre&s;ent condition. This har&s;h treat|ment
quite extinqui&s;hed in her brea&s;t any remains
of affection towards him<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 87. Keith, p. 445.</NOTE> Murray proceeded af|terwards
to break, in a more public manner, all terms
of decency with her. He &s;ummoned a Parliament;
and that a&s;&s;embly, after voting that &s;he was undoubt|edly
an accomplice in her hu&s;band's murder, condemn|ed
her to impri&s;onment, ratified her dimi&s;&s;ion of the
crown, and acknowleged her &s;on for King, and Mur|ray
for regent<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. p. 206. &s;eq.</NOTE> The regent, who was a man of vi|gour
and abilities, employed him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully in
reducing the kingdom. He bribed Sir James Bal|four
to &s;urrender the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh: He con|&s;trained
the garri&s;on of Dunbar to open their gates:
And he demoli&s;hed that fortre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT tho' every thing thus bore a favourable a&s;|pect
to the new government, and all men &s;eemed to
&s;ubmit to Murray's authority; a violent revolution,
however nece&s;&s;ary, can never be effected without great
di&s;contents; and it was not likely that in a country,
where the government, in its mo&s;t &s;ettled &s;tate, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
a very disjointed authority, a new e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
&s;hould meet with $o interruption or di&s;turbance.
Few con&s;iderable men of the nation &s;eemed wil|ling
to &s;upport Mary, &s;o long as Bothwel was pre&s;ent;
but the removal of that obnoxious nobleman had al|tered
the &s;entiments of many. The duke of Cha|telraut,
being di&s;appointed of the regency, bore no
good will to Murray and his counfellors; and the
&s;ame &s;entiments were embraced by all his numerous
retainers: Several of the nobility, finding that others
had taken the lead among the a&s;&s;ociators, formed a
<PB N="129" REF="142">
faction apart, and oppo&s;ed the prevailing power:
And be&s;ides &s;ome remains of duty and affection to|wards
Mary; the malecontent lords, finding every thing
carried to extremity again&s;t her, were naturally led to
embrace her cau&s;e, and &s;helter them&s;elves under her
authority. All tho&s;e, who retained any propen&s;ity
to the catholic religion, were inclined to join this par|ty;
and even the people in general, tho' they had
formerly either dete&s;ted Mary's crimes, or blamed her
imprudence, were now moved by her misfortunes
to compa&s;&s;ionate her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and lamented;
that a per&s;on, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many amiable accom|pli&s;hments,
joined to &s;uch high dignity, &s;hould be
treated with &s;uch extreme rigour and &s;everity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Buchan. lib. xviii. c. 53.</NOTE> Ani|mated
by all the&s;e motives, many of the principal no|bility,
now adherents to the Queen of Scots, met
at Hamilton, and concerted mea&s;ures for &s;upporting
the cau&s;e of that prince&s;s.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e humours were in fermentation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1568.</NOTE>
Mary was employed in contrivances for effecting her
e&s;ape; and &s;he engaged, by her charms and care&s;&s;es,
a young gentleman, George Douglas, brother to the
laid of Lochlevin, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in that enterprize.
She even went &s;o far as to give him hopes of e&s;pou&s;|ing
her, after her marriage with Bothwel &s;hould be
di&s;&s;olved on the plea of force; and &s;he propo&s;ed this
expedient to the regent, who rejected it. Douglas,
however, per&s;evered in his endeavours to free her
from captivity; and having all opportunities of acce&s;s
to the hou&s;e, he was at la&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in the under|taking.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d May.</NOTE>
He conveyed her in di&s;gui&s;e into a &s;mall
boat, and him&s;elf rowed her a&s;hore. She ha&s;tened to
Hamilton; and the news of her arrival in that place
being immediately &s;pread abroad, many of the nobility
flocked to her with their forces. A bond of a&s;&s;ocia|tion
for her defence was &s;igned by the earls of Ar|gyle,
<PB N="130" REF="143">
Huntley, Eglington, Crawford, Ca&s;&s;iles, Rothes,
Montro&s;e, Southerland, Errol, nine bi&s;hops, and
nine barons, be&s;ides many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
gentry<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 475.</NOTE> And in a few days an army, to the num|ber
of &s;ix thou&s;and men, was a&s;&s;embled under her
&s;tandard.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was no &s;ooner informed of Mary's
e&s;cape, than &s;he di&s;covered her re&s;olution of per&s;e|vering
in the &s;ame generous and friendly mea&s;ures,
which &s;he had hitherto pur&s;ued. If &s;he had not
employed force again&s;t the regent, during the impri|&s;onment
of that prince&s;s, &s;he had been chiefly with|held
by the fear of pu&s;hing him to greater extremities
again&s;t her<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 463. Cabbala, p. 141.</NOTE>; but &s;he had propo&s;ed to the court of
France an expedient, which, tho' le&s;s violent, would
have been no le&s;s effectual for her &s;ervice: She de|&s;ired
that France and England &s;hould by concert cut
off all commerce with the Scots, till they &s;hould do
ju&s;tice to their injured &s;overeign<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 462.</NOTE> She now di&s;|patched
Leighton into Scotland to offer both her good
offices, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her force to Mary; but
as &s;he was apprehen&s;ive of the entrance of French
troops into the kingdom, &s;he de&s;ired that the contro|ver&s;y
between the Queen of Scots and her &s;ubjects
might by that prince&s;s be referred entirely to her ar|bitration,
and that no foreign &s;uccours &s;hould be in|troduced
into Scotland<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 473. in the notes. Anderson. vol. IV. p. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT Elizabeth had not leizure to exert fully her
offorts in favours of Mary. The regent made ha&s;te
to a&s;&s;emble forces; and notwith&s;tanding that his army
was inferior in number to that of the Queen of Scots,
he took the field again&s;t her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th May.</NOTE> A battle was fought at
Lang&s;ide near Gla&s;gow, which was entirely deci&s;ive
in favour of the a&s;&s;ociated lords; and tho' the regent,
<PB N="131" REF="144">
after his victory, &s;topt the blood&s;hed, yet was the
action followed by a total di&s;per&s;ion of the Queen's
party. That unhappy prince&s;s fled &s;outhwards from
the field of battle with great precipitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary flies into Eng|land.</NOTE> and came,
with a few attendants, to the borders of England. She
here deliberated concerning her next mea&s;ures, which
would probably prove &s;o important to her future hap|pine&s;s
or mi&s;ery. She found it impo&s;&s;ible to remain
in her own kingdom: She had an aver&s;ion, in her
pre&s;ent wretched condition, to return into France,
where &s;he had formerly appeared with &s;o much &s;plen|dour;
and was not, be&s;ides, provided of a ve&s;&s;el, which
could &s;afely convey her thither: The late generous
behaviour of Elizabeth made her hope for defence,
and even a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from that quarter<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Jebb's Collection, vol. I. p. 420.</NOTE>; and as the
pre&s;ent fears of her dome&s;tic enemies were the mo&s;t
urgent, &s;he overlooked all other con&s;iderations, and
embraced the re&s;olution of taking &s;helter in Eng|land.
She embarked on board a fi&s;hing-boat in Gal|loway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th May.</NOTE>
and landed the &s;ame day at Wirkington in
Cumberland, about thirty miles di&s;tant from Carli&s;le;
whence &s;he immediately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to
London; notifying her arrival, de&s;iring liberty to vi|&s;it
Elizabeth, and craving her protection, in con&s;e|quence
of former profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, made her
by that prince&s;s.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH now found her&s;elf in a &s;ituation, when
it was become nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome deci&s;ive re&s;olu|tion
with regard to her treatment of the Queen of
Scots; and as &s;he had hitherto, contrary to the opini|on
of Cecil, attended more to the motives of genero|&s;ity
than of policy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cabala, p. 140.</NOTE>, &s;he was engaged by that prudent
mini&s;ter to weigh anew all the con&s;iderations, which
occurred in this critical conjuncture. He repre&s;ented,
that the party, which had dethroned Mary, and had at
<PB N="132" REF="145">
pre&s;ent a&s;&s;umed the government of Scotland, were
always the partizans of the Engli&s;h alliance, and
were engaged, by all the motives of religion and of
intere&s;t, to per&s;evere in their connexions with Eliza|beth:
That tho' Murray and his friends might com|plain
of &s;ome unkind u&s;age during their bani&s;hment
in England; they would ea&s;ily forget the&s;e grounds of
quarrel, when they con&s;idered, that Elizabeth was the
only ally, on whom they could &s;afely rely, and that
their own Queen, by her attachment to the catholic
faith, and by her other connexions, excluded them en|tirely
from the friend&s;hip of France, and even from that
of Spain: That Mary, on the other hand, even before
her violent breach with her prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, was in
&s;ecret entirely governed by the coun&s;els of the hou&s;e
of Gui&s;e; much more, would &s;he implicity comply
with their views, when by her own mi&s;conduct the
power of that family and of the zealous catholics was
become her &s;ole re&s;ource and &s;ecurity: That her pre|ten&s;ions
to the Engli&s;h crown would render her a
very dangerous in&s;trument in their hands&punc; and, were
&s;he once able to &s;uppre&s;s the prote&s;tants in her own
kingdom, &s;he would unite the Scots and Engli&s;h ca|tholics,
with tho&s;e of all foreign &s;tates, in one con|federacy
again&s;t the religion and government of Eng|land:
That it behoved Elizabeth therefore to proceed
with caution in the de&s;ign of re&s;toring her rival to the
throne; and to take care, both that that enterprize,
if undertaken, &s;hould be effected by Engli&s;h forces
alone, and that full &s;ecurities &s;hould beforehand be
provided for the reformers and the reformation in
Scotland: That above all, it was requi&s;ite to guard
carefully the per&s;on of that prince&s;s; le&s;t, finding this
unexpected re&s;erve in the Engli&s;h friend&s;hip, &s;he
&s;hould &s;uddenly take the re&s;olution of flying into
France, and &s;hould attempt by foreign force to recover
<PB N="133" REF="146">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her authority:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1563.</NOTE> That her de&s;perate fortunes
and broken reputation fitted her for any attempt;
and her re&s;entment, when &s;he &s;hould find her&s;elf thus
defected by the Queen, would concur with her ambi|tion
and her bigotry, and render her an unrelenting,
as well as powerful, enemy to the Engli&s;h govern|ment:
That if &s;he was once abroad, in the hands of
enterprizing catholics, the attack of England would
appear to her as ea&s;y as that of Scotland; and the only
method, &s;he mu&s;t imagine, of recovering her native
kingdom, would be to acquire that crown, to which
&s;he would e&s;teem her&s;elf equally intitled: That a
neutrality in &s;uch intere&s;ting &s;ituations, tho' it might
be pretended, could never, without the mo&s;t extreme
danger, be upheld by the Queen; and the detention
of Mary was equally requi&s;ite, whether the power of
England were to be employed in her favour, or
again&s;t her: That nothing indeed was more becoming
a great prince than genero&s;ity; yet the &s;ugge&s;tions of
this noble principle could never, without the utmo&s;t im|prudence,
be con&s;ulted in &s;uch delicate circum&s;tances
as tho&s;e in which the Queen was at pre&s;ent placed;
where her own &s;afety and the intere&s;ts of her people
were intimately concerned in every re&s;olution which
&s;he embraced: That tho' the example of &s;ucce&s;sful
rebellion, e&s;pecially in a neighbouring country, could
be no wi&s;e agreeable to any &s;overeign, yet Mary's im|prudence
had been &s;o great, perhaps her crimes &s;o
enormous, that the in&s;urrection of &s;ubjects, after &s;uch
provocation, could no longer be regarded as a prece|dent
again&s;t other princes: That it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;a|ry
for Elizabeth to a&s;certain, in a regular and &s;atisfac|tory
manner, the extent of Mary's guilt, and thence
to determine the degree of protection which &s;he ought
to afford her, again&s;t her di&s;contented &s;ubjects: That
as no glory could &s;urpa&s;s that of defending oppre&s;&s;ed
innocence, it was equally infamous to patronize vice
<PB N="134" REF="147">
and murder on the throne; and the contagion of &s;uch
di&s;honour, would extend it&s;elf to all who countenanced
or &s;upported it: And that if the crimes of the Scotti&s;h
prince&s;s &s;hould, on enquiry, appear as great and cer|tain
as was affirmed and believed, every mea&s;ure
again&s;t her, which policy &s;hould dictate, would thence
be ju&s;tified; or if &s;he &s;hould be found innocent, every
enterprize, which friend&s;hip &s;hould in&s;pire, would be
acknowledged laudable and glorious.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to the&s;e views, Elizabeth re&s;olved to
proceed in a &s;eemingly friendly, but really cautious
manner, with the Queen of Scots; and &s;he immedi|ately
&s;ent orders to Lady Scrope, &s;i&s;ter to the duke of
Norfolk, a lady who lived in the neighbourhood, to
attend on that prince&s;s. Soon after &s;he di&s;patched
to her the lord Scrope him&s;elf, warden of the marches,
and Sir Francis Knolles, vice chamberlain. They
found Mary already lodged in the ca&s;tle of Carli&s;le;
and after expre&s;&s;ing the Queen's &s;ympathy with her
in her late misfortunes, they told her, that her reque&s;t
of being allowed to vi&s;it their &s;overeign, and of be|ing
admitted to her pre&s;ence, could not at pre&s;ent
be complied with: Till &s;he had cleared her&s;elf of her
hu&s;band's murder, of which &s;he was &s;o &s;trongly ac|cu&s;ed.
Elizabeth could not without di&s;honour &s;how
her any countenance, or appear indifferent to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation
of &s;o near a kin&s;man<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. p. 54, 65, 82, 83, 86.</NOTE> So unexpected a check
threw Mary into tears; and the nece&s;&s;ity of her &s;itua|tion
extorted from her a declaration, that &s;he would
willingly ju&s;tify her&s;elf to her &s;i&s;ter from all imputa|tions,
and would &s;ubmit her cau&s;e to the arbitration
of &s;o good a friend<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 10, 55, 87.</NOTE>. Two days after, &s;he &s;ent lord
Herreis to London with a letter to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="148">
THIS conce&s;&s;ion which Mary could &s;carce avoid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1568</NOTE>
without an acknowledgement of guilt, was the point
expected and de&s;ired by Elizabeth: She immediately
di&s;patched Midlemore to the regent of Scotland;
requiring him both to de&s;i&s;t from the farther pro&s;ecu|tion
of his Queen's party, and to &s;end &s;ome per&s;ons
to London to ju&s;tify his conduct with regard to her.
Murray might ju&s;tly be &s;tartled at receiving a me&s;&s;age,
which mu&s;t have appeared &s;omewhat imperious; but
as his dome&s;tic enemies were numerous and power|ful,
and England was the &s;ole ally, which he could
expect among foreign nations, he was re&s;olved ra|ther
to dige&s;t the affront than provoke Elizabeth by
a refu&s;al. He al&s;o con&s;idered, that tho' that Queen
had hitherto appeared partial to Mary, her intere&s;t
evidently engaged her to &s;upport the King's cau&s;e in
Scotland; and it was not to be doubted but that
penetrating prince&s;s would in the end di&s;cover this
advantage, and would at lea&s;t afford him a patient
and equitable hearing. He therefore replied, that he
would him&s;elf take a journy into England, atten|ded
with other commi&s;&s;ioners, and would willingly
&s;ubmit the determination of his cau&s;e to Eliza|beth<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. p. 13&mdash;16.</NOTE></P>
<P>LORD Herreis now perceived, that his mi&s;tre&s;s
had advanced too far in her conce&s;&s;ions: He endeavour|ed
to maintain, that Mary could not, without dimi|nution
of her royal dignity, &s;ubmit to a conte&s;t with
her rebellious &s;ubjects before a foreign prince; and he
required either pre&s;ent aid from England, or liberty
for his Queen to pa&s;s over into France. Being pre&s;&s;ed,
however, with the former agreement before the Eng|li&s;h
council, he again renewed his con&s;ent; but in
a few days he began anew to recoil, and it was with
&s;ome difficulty that he was brought to acquie&s;ce in
<PB N="136" REF="149">
the fir&s;t determination<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, p. 16&mdash;20.</NOTE> The&s;e fluctuations, which
were ince&s;&s;antly renewed, &s;howed his vi&s;ible reluc|tance
to the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by the court of Eng|land.</P>
<P>THE
Queen of Scots di&s;covered on le&s;s aver&s;ion to
the trial propo&s;ed; and it required all the artifice and
prudence of Elizabeth to make her per&s;evere in the
agreement to which &s;he had at fir&s;t con&s;ented. This
latter prince&s;s &s;till &s;aid to her, that &s;he de&s;ired not,
without Mary's con&s;ent and approbation, to enter into
this que&s;tion, and pretended only as a friend to hear
her ju&s;tification: That &s;he was confident there would
be found no difficulty in refuting all the calumnies of
her enemies; and even if her apology &s;hould fall &s;hort
of full conviction, Elizabeth was determined to &s;up|port
her cau&s;e, and procure her &s;ome rea&s;onable terms
of accommodation: And that it was never meant, that
&s;he &s;hould be cited to a trial on the accu&s;ation of her
rebellious &s;ubjects, but on the contrary, that they
&s;hould be &s;ummoned to appear and ju&s;tify them&s;elves
for their conduct towards her<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 11. 12, 13, 109, 110.</NOTE> Allured by the&s;e
plau&s;ible profe&s;&s;ions, the Queen of Scots agreed to
ju&s;tify her&s;elf by her own commi&s;&s;ioners before com|mi&s;&s;ioners
which &s;hould be appointed by Elizabeth.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, the lord Scrope and Sir
Francis Knolles; who re&s;ided with Mary at Carli&s;le,
had leizure to &s;tudy her character, and to make re|port
of it to Elizabeth. Unbroken by her misfortunes,
re&s;olute in her purpo&s;e, active in her enterprizes, &s;he
a&s;pired to nothing but victory, and was determined to
endure any extremity, to undergo any difficulty, and
to try every fortune, rather than abandon her cau&s;e,
or yield the &s;uperiority to her enemies. Eloquent, in|&s;inuating,
affable; &s;he had already convinced all tho&s;e
who approached her, of the innocence of her pa&s;t con|duct,
and as &s;he declared her fixed purpo&s;e to require
<PB N="137" REF="150">
aid of her friends all over Europe, and even to have
recour&s;e to infidels and barbarians, rather than fail of
vengeance again&s;t her per&s;ecutors, it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee
the danger to which her charms, her &s;pirit, her addre&s;s,
if allowed to operate with their full force, would expo&s;e
them<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. p. 54, 71, 72, 74, 78, 92.</NOTE> The court of England, therefore, who under
pretence guarding her, had already, in effect, detained
her clo&s;e pri&s;oner, were determined to watch her with
&s;till greater vigilance. As Carli&s;le, by its &s;ituation on
the borders, afforded her great opportunities for con|triving
her e&s;cape, they removed her to Bolton, a &s;eat
of lord Scrope's in York&s;hire: And the i&s;&s;ue of the
controver&s;y between her and the Scots nation was re|garded
as a &s;ubject more momentous to Elizabeth's
&s;ecurity and intere&s;ts, than it had ever hitherto been
apprehended.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons, appointed by the Engli&s;h court for
the examination of this great cau&s;e, were the duke of
Nor&s;olk, the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, and Sir Ralph Sadler;
and York was named as the place of conference. Le&s;|ley,
bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, the lords Herreis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th October.</NOTE> Leving&s;tone
and Boyde, with five per&s;ons more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conferences at York and Hampton|court.</NOTE> appeared as com|mi&s;&s;ioners
from the Queen of Scots. The earl of
Murray, regent, the earl of Morton, the bi&s;hop of
Orkney, lord Linde&s;ey, and the abbot of Dunfermling
were appointed commi&s;&s;ioners from the King and king|dom
of Scotland. Secretary Ledington, George Bu|chanan,
the famous poet and hi&s;torian, with &s;ome others,
were named as their a&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>
<P>IT was a great circum&s;tance of Elizabeth's glory,
that &s;he was thus cho&s;en umpire between the factions
of a neighbouring kingdom, which had, during many
centuries, entertained the mo&s;t violent jealou&s;y and
animo&s;ity again&s;t England; and her felicity was equally
rare, in having the fortune and fame of &s;o dangerous
a rival, who had long given her the greate&s;t inquietude,
<PB N="138" REF="151">
now entirely at her di&s;po&s;al. Some circum&s;tances of
her late conduct had di&s;covered a bya&s;s towards the
&s;ide of Mary: Her prevailing intere&s;ts led her to fa|vour
the enemies of that prince&s;s: The profe&s;&s;ions of
impartiality, which &s;he had made, were open and fre|quent;
and &s;he had &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that each &s;ide ac|cu&s;ed
her commi&s;&s;ioners of partiality towards their ad|ver&s;aries<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 40.</NOTE> She her&s;elf appears, by the in&s;tructions
given them, to have fixed no plan for the deci&s;ion; but
&s;he new, that the advantages, which &s;he &s;hould reap,
mu&s;t be great, whatever i&s;&s;ue the cau&s;e &s;hould take.
If Mary's crimes could be a&s;certained by undoubted
proof, &s;he could for ever bla&s;t the reputation of that
prince&s;s, and might ju&s;tifiably detain her for ever a
clo&s;e pri&s;oner in England: If the evidence fell &s;hort of
conviction, it was propo&s;ed to re&s;tore her to her throne,
but with &s;uch &s;trict limitations, as would leave Eli|zabeth
perpetual arbiter of all differences between the
parties in Scotland, and render her in effect ab&s;olute
mi&s;tre&s;s of that Kingdom.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 14, 15, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p. 110.</NOTE></P>
<P>MARY's commi&s;&s;ioners, before they gave in their
complaints again&s;t her enemies in Scotland, entered a
prote&s;t, that their appearance in the cau&s;e &s;hould no
wi&s;e affect the independance of her crown, or be con|&s;trued
as a mark of &s;ubordination to England: The
Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners received this prote&s;t, but with
a re&s;erve to the claim of England. The complaint of
that prince&s;s was next read, and contained a detail of
all the injuries, which &s;he had &s;uffered, &s;ince her mat|riage
with Bothwel: That her &s;ubjects had taken arms
again&s;t her, on pretence of freeing her from captivity;
that when &s;he put her&s;elf into their hands, they had
committed her to clo&s;e cu&s;tody in Lochlevin; had
crowned her &s;on, an infant, in her place; had again
taken arms again&s;t her after her delivery from pri&s;on;
<PB N="139" REF="152">
had rejected all her propo&s;als for accommodation; had
given battle to her troops; and had obliged her, for the
&s;afety of her per&s;on, to take &s;helter in England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol, IV. part 2. p. 52. Goodall, vol. II. p. 128. Haynes, p. 478</NOTE>.
The earl of Murray, in an&s;wer to this complaint,
gave a &s;ummary and imperfect account of the late tran&s;|actions:
That the earl of Bothwel, the known mur|derer
of the late King, had, a little time after the com|mi&s;&s;ion
of that crime, &s;eized the per&s;on of the Queen
and led her to Dunbar; that he acquired &s;uch influence
over her as to gain her con&s;ent to marry him, and he
had accordingly procured a divorce from his former
wife, and had pretended to celebrate his marriage
with the Queen; that the &s;candal of this tran&s;action,
the di&s;honour which it brought on the whole nation,
the danger to which the infant prince was expo&s;ed
from the attempts of that audacious man, had obliged
the nobility to take arms, and oppo&s;e his criminal
de&s;igns and enterprizes; that after the Queen, in order
to &s;ave him, had thrown her&s;elf into their hands, &s;he
&s;till di&s;covered &s;uch a violent attachment to him, that
they found it nece&s;&s;ary, for their own and the public
fa&s;ety, to confine her per&s;on, during a &s;ea&s;on, till Both|wel
and the other munderers of her hu&s;band could be
tried and puni&s;hed for their crimes; and that during
this confinement, &s;he had voluntarily, without com|pul&s;ion
or violence, merely from di&s;gu&s;t at the in|quietude
and vexations attending power, re&s;igned her
crown to her only &s;on, and had appointed the earl of
Murray regent during the minority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 64 &amp; &s;eq. Goodall, vol. II. p. 144.</NOTE> The Queen's
an&s;wer to this apology was obvious: That &s;he did not
know and never could &s;u&s;pect, that Bothwel, who had
been acquitted by a jury, and recommended to her by
all the nobility for her hu&s;band, was the murderer
of the King; that &s;he ever was, and &s;till continues de|&s;irous,
<PB N="140" REF="153">
that, if he be guilty, he may be brought to
condign puni&s;hment; that her re&s;ignation of the crown
was extorted from her by the well-grounded fears
of her life, and even by the direct menaces of vi|olence;
and that Thro$morton, the Engli&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador,
as well as others of her friends, had advi&s;ed her
to &s;ign that paper as the only means of &s;aving her&s;elf
from the la&s;t extremity, and had a&s;&s;ured her, that a
con&s;ent, given under the&s;e circum&s;tances, could never
have any force or validity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p 60. &amp; &s;eq. Goodall, vol. II. p. 162.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So far the Queen of Scots &s;eemed plainly to have the
advantage in the conte&s;t; and the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ion|ers
might have been &s;urprized, that Murray had made
&s;o weak a defence, and had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all the material
imputations again&s;t that prince&s;s, on which his party
had ever &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted, had not &s;ome private
conferences previou&s;ly informed them of the &s;ecret.
Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners had boa&s;ted, that Elizabeth,
from regard to her kin&s;woman, and from her de&s;ire
of maintaining the rights of &s;overeigns, was deter|mined,
however criminal the couduct of, that prince&s;s
might appear, to re&s;tore her to the throne.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part. 2. p. 45. Goodall, vol. II. p. 127.</NOTE>; and
Murray, reflecting on &s;ome pa&s;t mea&s;ures of the En|gli&s;h
court, began to apprehend that there were but too
ju&s;t grounds for their expectations. He believed, that
Mary, if he would agree to conceal the mo&s;t violent
part of the accu&s;ation again&s;t her, would &s;ubmit to any
rea&s;onable terms of accommodation; but if he once
proceeded &s;o far as to charge her with the whole of her
guilt, no compo&s;ition could afterwards take place;
and &s;hould &s;he ever be re&s;tored, either by the power of
Elizabeth, or the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her other friends, he and
his party mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to her mo&s;t &s;evere and im|placable
vengeance.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">An|der&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 47, 48. Goodall, vol. II. p. 159.</NOTE> He re&s;olved therefore not to
venture ra&s;hly on a mea&s;ure, which it would be im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="141" REF="154">
for him ever to recal; and he paid privately a
vi&s;it to Norfolk and the other Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners,
confe&s;&s;ed his &s;cruples, laid before them the evidences
of the Queen's guilt, and de&s;ired to have &s;ome &s;ecurity
for Elizabeth's protection, in ca&s;e the&s;e evidences
&s;hould, upon examination, appear entirely &s;atisfactory.
Norfolk was not &s;ecretly di&s;plea&s;ed with the&s;e &s;cruples
of the regent.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 92. Melvil, p. 94. 95. Haynes, p. 574.</NOTE>. He had ever been a partizan of the
Queen of Scots: Secretary Ledington, who began
al&s;o to incline to that party, and was a man of &s;ingu|lar
addre&s;s and capacity, had engaged him to embrace
farther views in her favour, and even to think of
e&s;pou&s;ing her: And tho' that duke confe&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol IV. part 2. p. 77.</NOTE>,
that the proofs again&s;t Mary &s;eemed to him un|que&s;tionable,
he encouraged Murray in his pre|&s;ent
re&s;olution not to produce them publickly in the
conferences before the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 57, 77. State Trials, vol. I. p. 76.</NOTE></P>
<P>NORFOLK, however, was obliged to tran&s;mit to court
the queries propo&s;ed by the regent. The&s;e queries con|&s;i&s;ted
of four particulars: Whether the Engli&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ioners
had authority from their &s;overeign to pro|nounce
any &s;entence again&s;t Mary, in ca&s;e her guilt
&s;hould be fully proved before them? Whether they
would promi&s;e to exerci&s;e that authority, and pro|ceed
to an actual &s;entence? Whether the Queen of
Scots, if &s;he was found guilty, &s;hould be delivered into
the hands of the regent, or, at lea&s;t, &s;o &s;ecured in
England, that &s;he never &s;hould be able to di&s;turb the
tranquillity of Scotland? and, Whether Elizabeth
would al&s;o, in that ca&s;e, promi&s;e to acknowledge the
young King, and protect the regent in his autho|rity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 55. Goodall, vol. II. p. 130.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, when the&s;e queries, with the other
tran&s;actions, were laid before her, began to think that
<PB N="142" REF="155">
they pointed towards a conclu&s;ion more deci&s;ive and
more advantageous than &s;he had hitherto expected.
She determined, therefore, to bring the matter into
full light: and under pretext that the di&s;tance from her
per&s;on retarded the proceedings of her commi&s;&s;ioners,
&s;he ordered them to come to London, and there con|tinue
the conferences. On their appearance, &s;he imme|diately
joined in commi&s;&s;ion with them, &s;ome of the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable of her council; Sir Nicholas Bacon
lord keeper, the earls of Arundel and Leice&s;ter, lord
Clinton, admiral, and Sir William Cecil, &s;ecretary<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 99.</NOTE>.
The Queen of Scots, who knew nothing of the&s;e &s;ecret
motives, and who expected, that fear or decency would
&s;till re&s;train Murray from proceeding to any violent
accu&s;ation again&s;t her, expre&s;&s;ed an entire &s;atisfaction
in this adjournment, and declared, that the affair,
being under the immediated in&s;pection of Elizabeth,
was now in the hands where &s;he mo&s;t de&s;ired it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 95. Goodall, vol. II. p. 177, 179.</NOTE>. The
conferences were accordingly continued at Hampton-Court;
and Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners, as before, made no
&s;cruple to be pre&s;ent at them.</P>
<P>THE Queen, meanwhile, gave a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer
to all Murray's demands; and having declared, that
tho' &s;he wi&s;hed and hoped, from the pre&s;ent enquiry,
to be entirely convinced of Mary's innocence, yet if
the event &s;hould prove contrary, and if that prince&s;s
&s;hould appear guilty of her hu&s;band's murder, &s;he
&s;hould, for her part, deem her ever after unworthy of
a throne.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 199.</NOTE>. The regent, encouraged by this declara|tion,
opened more fully his charge again&s;t the Queen
of Scots; and after expre&s;&s;ing his reluctance to pro|ceed
to that extremity, and prote&s;ting, that nothing
but the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-defence, which mu&s;t not be
abandoned for any delicacy, could have engaged him in
&s;uch a mea&s;ure, he proceeded to accu&s;e her in plain
<PB N="143" REF="156">
terms of participation and con&s;ent in the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination
of the King<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 115, &amp; &s;eq. Goodall, vol. II. p. 206.</NOTE>. The earl of Lenox too appeared before
the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners; and imploring vengeance
for the murder of his &s;on, accu&s;ed Mary as an ac|compli$$ce
with Bothwel in that enormity.<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 122. Goodal, vol. II. p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN this charge was &s;o unexpectedly given in,
and copies of it tran&s;mitted to the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, lord
Herreis, and the re&s;t of Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners, they
ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to return any an&s;wer; and they
grounded their &s;ilence on very extraordinary rea&s;ons:
They had orders, they &s;aid, from their mi&s;tre&s;s, if any
thing was advanced that might touch her honour, not
to make any defence, as &s;he was a &s;overeign prince&s;s,
and could not be &s;ubject to any tribunal; and they
required, that &s;he &s;hould previou&s;ly be admitted to Eli|zabeth's
pre&s;ence, to whom, and to whom alone, &s;he
was determined to ju&s;tify her innocence.<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 125, &amp; &s;eq. Goodal, vol. II. 184, 211, 217.</NOTE>. They for|got,
that the conferences were at fir&s;t begun, and were
&s;till continued, with no other view than to clear her from
the accu&s;ations of her enemies; that Elizabeth had ever
pretended to enter into them only as her friend, by her
own con&s;ent and approbation, not as a&s;&s;uming any &s;upe|rior
juri&s;diction over her; that that prince&s;s had from
the beginning refu&s;ed to admit her to her pre&s;ence, till
&s;he &s;hould clear her&s;elf of the crimes imputed to her;
that &s;he had therefore di&s;covered no new &s;igns of partia|lity
by her per&s;everance in that re&s;olution; and that tho'
&s;he had granted an audience to the earl of Murray and
his collegues, &s;he had previou&s;ly conferred the &s;ame
honour on Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners.<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley's Negociations in Ander&s;on, vol. III. p. 25. Haynes, p. 487.</NOTE>; and her conduct was
&s;o far entirely equal to both parties.<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Mary's complaints of the Queen's partiality in admitting Murray to a conference was a mere pretext in order to break off the conference. She indeed employs that rea&s;on in her commi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e (&s;ee Good|all, vol. II. p. 184) but in her private letter, they are directed to make u&s;e of that commi&s;&s;ion to prevent her honour from being attacked. Good-all, vol. II. p. 183. It was the accu&s;ation therefore &s;he was only afraid of.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="157">
As the Queen of Scots refu&s;ed to give in any an&s;wer
to Murray's charge, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence &s;eemed
to be, that there could be no farther proceedings
in the trial. But tho' this &s;ilence might be inter|preted
as a pre&s;umption again&s;t her, it did not fully
an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of tho&s;e Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, who
were the enemies of that prince&s;s. They &s;till de&s;ired
to have in their hands the proofs of her guilt; and
in order to draw them with decency from the regent,
a judicious artifice was employed by Elizabeth. Mur|ray
was called before the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners; and
reproved by them, in the Queen's name, for the
atrocious imputations which he had the temerity to
throw upon his &s;overeign: But tho' the earl of Mur|ray,
they added, and the other commi&s;&s;ioners, had &s;o
far forgot the duty of allegiance to their prince, the
Queen never would overlook what &s;he owed to her
friend, her neighbour, and her kin&s;woman; and
&s;he therefore de&s;ired to know what they could &s;ay
in their own ju&s;tification.<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 147. Goodall, vol. II. p. 233.</NOTE> Murray, thus urged,
made no difficulty of producing the proofs of his
charge again&s;t the Queen of Scots; and among the
re&s;t, &s;ome love-letters and &s;onnets of her's to Bothwel,
wrote all in her own hand, and two other papers,
one wrote in her own hand, another &s;igned by her,
and wrote by the earl of Huntley; each of which con|tained
a promi&s;e of marriage with Bothwel, made
before the trial and acquital of that nobleman.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e important papers had been kept by Both|wel
in a &s;ilver box or ca&s;ket, which had been given
him by Mary, and which had belonged to her fir&s;t hu&s;|band
Francis; and tho' the prince&s;s had enjoined him to
<PB N="145" REF="158">
burn the letters as &s;oon as he had read them, he had
thought proper to pre&s;erve them carefully, as
pledges of her fidelity, and had committed them to
the cu&s;tody of Sir James Balfour, deputy-governor
of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh. When that fo$$e&s;s was
be&s;ieged by the a&s;&s;ociated lords, Bothwel &s;ent a &s;er|vant
to receive the ca&s;ket from the hands of the depu|ty-governor.
Balfour delivered it to the me&s;&s;enger;
but as he had at that time received &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t
from Bothwel, and was &s;ecretly negociating an agree|ment
with the ruling party, he took care, by convey|ing
private intelligence to the earl of Morton, to
make the papers be intercepted by him. They con|tained
inconte&s;tible proofs of Mary's criminal cor|re&s;pondence
with Bothwel, of her con&s;ent to the
King's murder, and of her concurrence in that rape
which Bothwel pretended to commit upon her.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. p. 115. Goodall vol. II. p. 1.</NOTE>
Murray fortified this evidence by &s;ome te&s;timonies of
corre&s;pondent facts,<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. part 2. p. 165, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p. 243.</NOTE>; and he added, &s;ometime af|ter,
the dying confe&s;&s;ion of one Hubert, or French
Paris, as he was called, a &s;ervant of Bothwel's, who
had been executed for the King's murder, and who
directly charged the Queen with her being acce&s;&s;ary
to that criminal enterprize.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. II. p. 192. Goodall, vol. II. p. 76.</NOTE></P>
<P>MARY's commi&s;&s;ioners had u&s;ed every expedient
to ward this blow, which they &s;aw coming upon
them, and again&s;t which, it appears, they were not
provided of any proper defence. As &s;oon as Murray
opened his charge, they endeavoured to turn the con|ferences
from an enquiry into a negociation; and tho'
informed by the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, that nothing
could be more di&s;honourable for their mi&s;tre&s;s, than
to enter into a treaty with &s;uch undutiful &s;ubjects,
before &s;he had ju&s;tified her&s;elf from tho&s;e enormous

and finding, that the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;till
determined to proceed in the method which had been
projected, they finally broke off the conferences, and
never would make any reply. The&s;e papers have
all of them been &s;ince publi&s;hed. The objections
made to their authenticity, are in general of &s;mall
force: But were they ever &s;o &s;pecious, they cannot
now be hearkened to; &s;ince Mary, at the time when
the truth could have been fully cleared, did, in effect,
ratify the evidence again&s;t her, by recoiling from the
enquiry at the very critical moment, and refu&s;ing to
give any an&s;wer to the accu&s;ation of her enemies.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>We &s;hall not enter into a long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the authenticity of the&s;e letters: We &s;hall only remark in general, that the chief objections again&s;t them are, that they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have pa&s;&s;ed through the earl of Mor|ton's hands, the lea&s;t &s;crupulous of all Mary's enemies; and that they are, to the la&s;t degree, indecent, and even &s;omewhat inelegant, &s;uch as it is not likely &s;he would write. But to the&s;e pre&s;umptions we may oppo&s;e the fol|lowing con&s;iderations. (1.) Though it be not difficult to counterfeit a &s;ub|&s;cription, it is very difficult, and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, to counterfeit &s;everal pages, &s;o as to re&s;emble exactly the hand writing of any per&s;on. The&s;e let|ters were examined and compared with Mary's h$nd writing, by the Engli&s;h privvy council, and by a great many of the nobility, among whom were &s;eve|ral patizans of that prince&s;s. They might have been examined by the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, Herreis, and Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners. The regent mu&s;t have expect|ed, that they would be very critically examined by them: and had they not been able to &s;tand that te&s;t, he was only preparing a &s;cene of confu&s;ion to him&s;elf. Bi&s;hop Le&s;ly expre&s;sly declines the comparing the hands, which he calls no legal proof&punc; Goodall, vol. II. p. 389. (2) The letters are very long, much longer than they needed to have been, in order to &s;erve the pur|po&s;es of Mary's enemies; a circum&s;tance, which increa&s;ed the difficulty, and expo&s;ed any forgery the more to the ri&s;k of a detection. (3.) They are not &s;o gro&s;s and palpable, as forgeries commonly are; for they left &s;till a pretext for Mary's friends to a&s;&s;ert, that their meaning was &s;trained to make them appear criminal; &s;ee Goodall, vol. II. p. 361. (4.) There is a long contract of marriage, &s;aid to be wrote by the earl of Huntley, and &s;igned by the Queen, before Bothwell's acquital. Would Morton, without any ne|ce&s;&s;ity, have thus doubled the difficulties of the forgery; and the danger of detection? (5.) The letters are indi&s;creet; but &s;uch was apparently Ma|ry's conduct at that time: They are inelegant; but they have a carele&s;s, natural air, like letters ha&s;tily wrote between familiar friends. (6.) They contain &s;uch a variety of particular circum&s;tances, as no body could have thought of inventing, e&s;pecially as they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have afforded her many means of detection. (7.) We have not the originals of the letters, which were in French: We have only a Scots and Latin tran&s;lation from the original, and a French tran&s;lation profe&s;&s;edly done from the Latin. Now it is remarkable, that the Scots tran&s;lation is full of Gallici&s;ms, and is clearly a tran&s;lation from a French original: Such as <HI>make fault, faire des fautes; make it &s;eem that I believe. faire &s;emblant de le croire; make brek, faire breche; this is my fir&s;t journay, c&ecirc;&s;tma premiere journ &eacute;c; have you not de&s;ire to laugh, $ avez vous pas envie de rire; the place will hald unto the death, la place tiendra ju&s;qu'a la mort; he may not come forth of the hou&s;e this long time, il ne peut pas &s;ortir du logis de long tems; to make me adver|ti&s;ement, faire m'avertir; put order to it, mettre ordre a cela; di&s;charg$ your heart; decharger votre coeur; make gud watch, faites bon garde,</HI> &amp;c. (8.) There is a conver&s;ation, which &s;he mentions, between her&s;elf and the King one evening: but Murray produced before the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;io|ners, the te&s;timony of one Crawfor, a gentleman of the carl of Lenox, who &s;wore, that the King, on her departure from him, gave him an ac|count of the &s;ame conver&s;ation. (9.) There &s;eems very little rea&s;on why Murray and his a&s;&s;ociates &s;hould run the ri&s;k of &s;uch a dangerous forge|ry, which mu&s;t have rendered them infamous, if detected; &s;ince their cau&s;e, from Mary's known conduct, even without the&s;e letters, was &s;uf|ficiently good and ju&s;tifiable. (10.) Murray expo&s;ed the&s;e letters to the examination of per&s;ons qualified to judge of them; the Scots council, the Scots Parliament, Queen Elizabeth and her council, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of a great number of Mary's genuine letters. (11.) He gave Mary her&s;elf an opportunity of refuting and expo&s;ing him, if &s;he had cho&s;en to lay hold of it. (12.) The letters tally &s;o well with all the other parts of her conduct during that tran&s;action, that the&s;e proofs throw the &s;trong|e&s;t light on each other. (13.) The duke of Norfolk, who had examined the&s;e papers, and who favoured &s;o much Queen Mary, that he intended to marry her, and in the end lo&s;t his life in her cau&s;e, yet believed them authentic, and was fully convinced of her guilt. This appears not only from his letters above mentioned, to Queen Elizabeth and her mini&s;ters, but by his &s;ecret acknowledgment to Bani&s;ter, his mo&s;t tru&s;ty confident. See State Trials, vol. I. p. 81. In the conferences between the duke, &s;e|cretary Lidington, and the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, all of them zealous partizans of that prince&s;s, the &s;ame thing &s;eems always to be taken for granted, Ibid. p. 74, 75. See farther MS. in the Advocate's library. A. 3. 28. p. 314. from Cott, lib. Calig. c. 9. (14.) I need not repeat the pre|fumption drawn from Mary's re&s;u&s;al to an&s;wer. The only excu&s;e for her &s;ilence, is, that &s;he &s;u&s;pected Elizabeth to be a partial judge: It was not, indeed, the intere&s;t of that prince&s;s to acquit and ju&s;tify her rival and com|petitor; and we accordingly find that Lidington, from the &s;ecret informa|tion of the duke of Norfolk, informed Mary, by the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, that the Queen of England never meant to come to a deci&s;ion; but only to get into her hands the proofs of Mary's guilt, in order to bla&s;t her character: See State Trials, vol 1. p. 77. But this was a better rea&s;on for declin|ing the trial altogether than for breaking it off, on frivolous pretences, the very moment the chief accu&s;ation was unexpectedly opened again&s;t her. Tho' &s;he could not expect Elizabeth's final deci&s;ion in her favour, it was of importance to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, if &s;he had any, to the accu&s;a|tion of the Scots commi&s;&s;ioners. That an&s;wer could have been di&s;per&s;t for the conviction of the public, of foreign nations, and of po&s;terity. And &s;urely after the accu&s;ation and proofs were in Queen Elizabeth's hands, it could do no hurt to give in the an&s;wers. Mary's information, that the Queen never intended to come to a deci&s;ion, could be no ob&s;tacle to her ju&s;tification. (15.) The very di&s;appearance of the&s;e letters, is a pre&s;ump|tion of their authenticity. That event can be accounted for no way but from the care of King James's friends, who were de&s;irous to de&s;troy every proof of his mother's crimes. The di&s;appearance of Morton's narrative, and of Crawford's evidence, from the Cotton library, Calig. c. 1. mu&s;t have proceeded from a like cau&s;e. See MS. in the Advocate's library, A. 3. 29. p. 88.</P>
<P>I find an objection made to the authenticity of the letters, drawn from the vote of the Scots privy council, which affirms the letters to be wrote and &s;ub&s;cribed by Queen Mary's own hand; whereas the copies given in to the Parliament a few days after, were only wrote, not &s;ub&s;cribed. See Goodall, vol. 11. p. 64, 67. But it is not con&s;idered, that this circum|&s;tance is of no manner of force: There were certainly letters, true or fal&s;e, laid before the council; and whether the letters were true or fal&s;e, this mi&s;take procceds equally from the inaccuracy or blunder of the clerk. The mi&s;take is ea&s;ily accounted for: The letters were only wrote by her; the &s;econd contract with Bothwel was only &s;ub&s;cribed. A proper accurate di&s;tinction was not made; and they are all &s;aid to be wrote and &s;ub&s;cribed. A late writer, Mr. Goodall, has endeavoured to prove, that the&s;e letters cla&s;h with chronology, and that the Queen was not in the places mentioned in the letters, on the days there a&s;&s;igned: To confirm this, he produces charters and other deeds &s;igned by the Queen, where the date and place do not agree with the letters. But it is well known, that the date of charters, and &s;uch like grants, is no proof of the real day on which they were &s;igned by the &s;overeign. Papers of that kind commonly pa&s;s through different offices: The date is affixed by the fir&s;t office; and may precede very long the day of the &s;ignature.</P>
<P>The account given by Morton of the manner in which the papers came into his hands, is very natural. When he gave it to the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ion|ers, he had rea&s;on to think it would be canva&s;&s;ed with all the &s;everity of able adver&s;aries, intere&s;ted in the highe&s;t degree to refute it. It is proba|ble, that he could have confirmed it by many circum&s;tances and te&s;timo|nies; &s;ince they declined the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;onnets are inelegant; in&s;omuch, that both Brantome and Ron|fard, who knew Queen Mary's &s;tile, were a&s;&s;ured, when they &s;aw them, that they could not be her compo&s;ition. Jebb, vol. II. p. 478. But noper&s;on is equal in his productions, e&s;pecially one who&s;e &s;tyle is &s;o little formed as Mary's mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be. Not to mention, that &s;uch dangerous and criminal enterprizes leave little tranquillity of mind for ele|gant, poetical compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>In a word, Queen Mary might ea&s;ily have conducted the whole con&s;pi|racy again&s;t her hu&s;band, without opening her mind to any one per&s;on except Bothwel, and without writing a &s;crap of paper about it; but it was very difficult to have conducted it, &s;o as that her conduct &s;hould not be|tray her to men of di&s;cernment. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, her conduct was &s;o gro&s;s as$ to betray her to every body; and fortune threw into her ene|mies hands, papers by which they could convict her. The &s;ame infatua|tion and imprudence, which happily is the u&s;ual attendant of great $$imes, will account for both. It is proper to ob&s;erve, that there is not one circum&s;tance of the foregoing narrative, contained in the hi&s;tory, that is taken from Knox, Bu$$ anan, or even Thuanus, or, indeed, from any &s;u&s;pected authority.</P></NOTE>.</P>

BUT Elizabeth, though &s;he had &s;een enough for
her own &s;atisfaction, was determined, that the mo&s;t

with the&s;e tran&s;actions, and &s;hould be convinced

to them the earls of Northumberland, We&s;tmoreland,
Shrew&s;bury, Wore&s;ter, Huntingdon, and Warwic.
All the proceedings of the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners were
read to them: The evidences produced by Murray
were peru&s;ed: A great number of letters, wrote by
Mary to Elizabeth, were laid before them, and the
hand-writing compared with that of the letters deliver|ed
in by the regent: The refu&s;al of the Queen of
Scots commi&s;&s;ioners to make any reply, was related:
<PB N="150" REF="163">
And on the whole Elizabeth told them, that as &s;he had,
at fir&s;t, thought it improper, that Mary, after &s;uch
horrid crimes were imputed to her, &s;hould be admit|ted
to her pre&s;ence, before &s;he had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
ju&s;tified her&s;elf from the charge; &s;o now, when her
guilt was confirmed by &s;o many plau&s;ible evidences,

called in the Queen of Scots commi&s;&s;ioners, and after
ob&s;erving, that &s;he deemed it much more decent for
their mi&s;tre&s;s to continue the conferences, than to
require the liberty of ju&s;tifying her&s;elf in per&s;on;
&s;he told them, that Mary might either &s;end her re|ply
by a per&s;on whom &s;he tru&s;ted, or deliver it
her&s;elf to &s;ome Engli&s;h noblemen, whom Elizabeth
&s;hould appoint to wait upon her: But as to her re|&s;olution
of making no reply at all, &s;he mu&s;t regard it
as the &s;tronge&s;t confe&s;&s;ion of guilt; nor could they
ever be e&s;teemed her friends, who advi&s;ed her to that method of proceeding<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 179, &amp;c. Goodall, vol. II. p. 268.</NOTE> The&s;e topics &s;he enforced

Mary her&s;elf<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 183. Goodall, vol. II. p. 269.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots had no other &s;ubterfuge from
the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing remon&s;trances than &s;till to demand a
per&s;onal conference with Elizabeth: A conce&s;&s;ion
which, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, could never be granted<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cabala, p. 157.</NOTE>; both
becau&s;e Elizabeth knew, that that expedient could de|cide
nothing, and becau&s;e it brought matters to ex|tremity,
which that prince&s;s de&s;ired to avoid. In or|der
to keep her&s;elf better in countenance, Mary thought
of another device. Even after all the conferences
were broke off, &s;he ordered her commi&s;&s;ioners to ac|cu&s;e
the earl of Murray and his a&s;&s;ociates as the mur|derers
<PB N="151" REF="164">
of the King<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 280.</NOTE> But this accu&s;ation coming &s;o
late, being extorted merely by a complaint of Mur|ray's,
and being un&s;upported by any proof, could on|ly
be regarded as an angry retaliation upon her ene|my<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Unle&s;s we take this angry accu&s;ation, advanced by Queen Mary, to be an argument of Murray's guilt, there remains not the lea&s;t pre&s;ump|tion which &s;hould le$d us to &s;u&s;pect him to have been any wi&s;e an ac|complice in the King's murder. That Queen neyer pretended to give any proof of the charge; and her commi&s;&s;ioners affirmed at the time, that they them&s;elves knew of none, tho' they were ready to maintain its truth by their mi&s;tre&s;s's orders, and would produce &s;uch proof as &s;he &s;hould &s;end them. It is remarkable, that&punc; at that time, it was impo&s;&s;ible for either her or them to produce any proof; becau&s;e the conferences before the En|gli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners were previou&s;ly broke off.</P>
<P>It is true, the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, in an angry pamphlet, wrote by him un|der a borrowed name, (where it is ea&s;y to &s;ay any thing) affirms, that lord Herreis, a few days after the King's death, charged Murray with the guilt, openly, to his face, at his own table&punc; That nobleman, as Le&s;ly relates the matter, affirmed, that Murray, riding in Fife with one of his &s;ervants, the evening before the commi&s;&s;ion of that crime, &s;aid to him among other talk, <HI>This night 'ere morning the lord Darnley &s;hall lo&s;e his life.</HI> See Ander&s;on, vol. 1. p. 75. But this is only hear&s;ay of Le&s;ly's, con|cerning a hear&s;ay of Herreis's; and contains a very improbable fact. Would Murray, without any u&s;e or nece&s;&s;ity, communicate to a &s;ervant, &s;uch a dangerous and important &s;ecret, merely by way of conver&s;ation? We may al&s;o ob&s;erve, that lord Herreis him&s;elf was one of Queen Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners who accu&s;ed Murray. Had he ever heard this &s;tory, or given credit to it, was not that the time to have produced it; and not have affirmed, as he did, that he, for his part, knew nothing of Murray's guilt. See Goodall, vol. II. p. 307.</P>
<P>The earls of Huntley and Argyle accu&s;e Murray of this crime; but the rea&s;on which they a&s;&s;ign is mo&s;t ridiculous. He had given his con&s;ent to Queen Mary's divorce from the King; therefore he was the King's murderer. See Ander&s;on, vol. IV. part 2. p. 192. It is a &s;ure argu|ment, that the&s;e earls knew no better proof again&s;t Murray, otherwi&s;e they would have produced it, and not have in&s;i&s;ted on &s;o ab&s;urd a pre|&s;umption. Was not this al&s;o the time for Huntley to deny his writing Mary's contract with Bothwel, if that paper had been a forgery?</P>
<P>Murray could have no motive to commit that crime. The King, in|deed, bore him &s;ome ill-will; b$t the King him&s;elf was become &s;o de|&s;picable, both from his own ill-conduct and the Queen's aver&s;ion to him, that he could neither do good nor harm to any body. To judge by the event, in any ca&s;e, is always ab&s;urd; but more e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The King's murder, indeed, procured Murray the regency: But much more Queen Mary's ill-conduct and imprudence, which he could not po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee, and which never would have happened, had &s;he been en|tirely innocent.</P></NOTE> She al&s;o de&s;ired to have copies of the papers giv|en

<P>As Mary had thus put an end to the conference,
the regent expre&s;&s;ed great impatience to return into
Scotland; and he complained, that his enemies had
taken advantage of his ab&s;ence, and had thrown the
whole government into confu&s;ion. Elizabeth, there|fore,
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him; and granted him a loan of five
thou&s;and pounds, to bear the charges of his journey<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 677.</NOTE>.
During the conference at York, the duke of Chatel|rault
arrived at London, in pa&s;&s;ing from France;
and as the Queen knew, that he was engaged in Ma|ry's
party, and had very plu&s;ible preten&s;ions to the
regency of the King of Scots; &s;he thought proper to de|tain
him till after Murray's departure. But not|with&s;tanding
the&s;e marks of favour, and &s;ome other
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which &s;he &s;ecretly gave the regent<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">MS. in the Advocate's libra|$y. A 3, 29. p. 128. 129, $30, from Cott. Lib. Cal. c. 1.</NOTE>, &s;he
&s;till declined acknowledging the young King, or treat|ing
with Murray as regent of Scotland.</P>
<P>ORDERS were given for removing the Queen of
Scots from Bolton, a place &s;urrounded with catholics,
to Tutbury in the county of Stafford; where &s;he was
put under the cu&s;tody of the earl of Shrew&s;bury. Eli|zabeth
entertained hopes, that that prince&s;s, di&s;cou|raged
by her misfortunes, and confounded by the
late tran&s;actions, would be glad to &s;ecure a &s;afe
retreat from all the tempe&s;ts, with which &s;he
had been agitated; and &s;he promi&s;ed to bury every
thing in oblivion, provided Mary would agrees, ei|ther
to re&s;ign voluntarily her crown, or to a&s;&s;ociate
<PB N="153" REF="166">
her &s;on with her in the government; and the ad|mini&s;tration
to remain, during his minority, in the
hands of the earl of Murray<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Goodall, vol. II. p. 295.</NOTE> But that high-&s;pi|rited
prince&s;s refu&s;ed all treaty upon &s;uch terms, and
declared that her la&s;t words &s;hould be tho&s;e of a Queen
of Scotland. Be&s;ides many other rea&s;ons, &s;he &s;aid,
which fixed her in that re&s;olution, &s;he knew, that, if,
in the pre&s;ent emergence, &s;he made &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions,
her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion would be univer&s;ally deemed an acknow|legement
of guilt, and would ratify all the calumnies of
her enemies<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 301.</NOTE></P>
<P>MARY &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon the alternative of two de|mands;
either that Elizabeth &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t her in re|covering
her authority, or &s;hould give her liberty to
retire into France, and make trial of the friend&s;hip of
other princes: And as &s;he a&s;&s;erted, that &s;he had
come voluntarily into England, invited by many for|mer
profe&s;&s;ions of amity, &s;he thought that one of
the&s;e reque&s;ts could not, without the mo&s;t extreme
inju&s;tice, be refu&s;ed her. But Elizabeth, &s;en&s;ible of
the danger, which attended either of the&s;e propo&s;als,
was &s;ecretly re&s;olved to detain her &s;till a captive; and
as her retreat into England had been very little volun|tary,
her claim upon the Queen's genero&s;ity appeared
much le&s;s urgent than &s;he was willing to pretend. Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
it was thought, would to the prudent ju&s;tify
her detention: Her pa&s;t mi&s;conduct would apologize
for it to the equitable: And tho' it was fore&s;een, that
compa&s;&s;ion for her &s;ituation, joined to her intrigues and
in&s;inuating behaviour, would, while &s;he remained in
England, excite the zeal of her friends, e&s;pecially of
the catholics; the&s;e inconveniences were e&s;teemed
much le&s;s than tho&s;e which attended any other expe|dient.
Elizabeth tru&s;ted al&s;o to her own addre&s;s, for
eluding all tho&s;e difficulties: She propo&s;ed to avoid
breaking ab&s;olutely with the Queen of Scots, to keep
<PB N="154" REF="167">
her always in hopes of accommodation, to negotiate
perpetually with her, and &s;till to throw the blame of
not coming to any conclu&s;ion, either on unfore&s;een
accidents, or on the ob&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s of
others.</P>
<P>WE come now to mention &s;ome Engli&s;h affairs,
which we left behind us, that we might not interrupt
our narration of the events in Scotland, which form
&s;o material a part of the pre&s;ent reign. The term,
fixed by the treaty of Cateau-Cambre&s;is for the re&s;ti|tution
of Calais expired in 1567; and Elizabeth, af|ter
making her demand at the gates of that city, &s;ent
Sir Thomas Smith to Paris; and that mini&s;ter, in
conjunction with Sir Henry Norris, her ordinary am|ba&s;&s;ador,
enforced her preten&s;ions. Conferences were
held on that head, without coming to any conclu&s;ion.
The chancellor De L'Hopital told the Engli&s;h am|ba&s;&s;adors,
that tho' France by an article of the treaty
was obliged to re&s;tore Calais on the expiration of
eight years, there was another article of the &s;ame trea|ty,
which now deprived Elizabeth of all right, that
could accrue to her by that engagement: That it was
agreed, if the Engli&s;h &s;hould, during that interval,
commit ho&s;tilities upon France, they &s;hould in&s;tantly
forfeit all claim to Calais; and the taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Havre and Dieppe, with whatever pretences that
mea&s;ure might be covered, was a plain violation of
the peace between the nations: That tho' the&s;e places
were not taken by force, but put into Elizabeth's
hands by the governors; the&s;e governors were rebels;
and a corre&s;pondence with &s;uch offenders was the mo&s;t
flagrant injury, which could be committed to any &s;o|vereign:
That in the treaty, which en&s;ued upon the
expul&s;ion of the Engli&s;h from Normandy, the French
mini&s;ters had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to make any mention
of Calais, and had thereby declared their intention to
<PB N="155" REF="168">
take advantage of the title which had accrued ro the
crown of France: And that tho' a general clau&s;e had
been in&s;erted, implying a re&s;ervation of all claims;
this conce&s;&s;ion could not avail the Engli&s;h, who at
that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no ju&s;t claim to Calais, and had
previou&s;ly forfeited all preten&s;ions to that fortre&s;s<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 587.</NOTE>
The Queen was no wi&s;e &s;urprized at hearing the&s;e
allegations; and as &s;he knew, that the French court
intended not from the fir&s;t to make re&s;titution, much
le&s;s, after they could defend their refu&s;al by &s;uch plau|&s;ible
rea&s;ons, &s;he thought it better for the pre&s;ent to
&s;ubmit to the lo&s;s, than to pur&s;ue a doubtful title by
a war both dangerous and expen&s;ive, as well as un|&s;ea&s;onable<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 406.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH entered anew into negotiations for
marrying the archduke Charles; and &s;he &s;eemed at
pre&s;ent to have no great motive of policy, which might
induce her to make this fallacious offer: But as &s;he
was very rigorous in the terms in&s;i&s;ted on, and refu&s;ed
him all power and title, and even the exerci&s;e of his
religion in England, the treaty came to nothing; and
that prince, de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s in his addre&s;&s;es,
married the daughter of Albert, duke of Bavaria<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 407, 408.</NOTE>.

yoke of the papal authority, no one proceeded
with &s;o much rea&s;on and moderation as the church of
England; and advantage, which had been derived partly
from the interpo&s;ition of the civil magi&s;trate in this in|novation,
partly from the gradual and &s;low &s;teps by
which the reformation was conducted in that kingdom.
Rage and animo&s;ity again&s;t the c$atholic religion was
as little indulged as could be &s;uppo&s;ed in &s;uch a revolu|tion:
The fabric of the &s;ecular hierachy was maintain|ed
entire: The antient liturgy was pre&s;erved, &s;o far
as was thought con&s;i&s;tent with the new principles:
Many ceremonies, become venerable from age and pre|ceding
u&s;e, were retained: The &s;plendor of the catholic
wor&s;hip, tho' removed, had at lea&s;t given place to
order and decency: The di&s;tinctive habits of the clergy,
according to their different ranks, were continued:
No innovation was admitted merely from &s;pite and op|po&s;ition
to the former u&s;age: And the new religion,
by mitigating the genius of the antient &s;uper&s;tition,
and rendering it more compatible with the peace and
intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, had pre&s;erved it&s;elf in that happy
medium, which wi&s;e men have always &s;ought, and
<PB N="157" REF="172">
which the people have &s;o &s;eldom been able to main|tain.</P>
<P>BUT tho' &s;uch in general was the &s;pirit of the re|formation
in that country, many of the Engli&s;h re|formers,
being men of a more warm complexion and
more ob&s;tinate temper, endeavoured to pu&s;h matters to
extremity again&s;t the church of Rome, and indulged
them&s;elves in the mo&s;t violent contrariety and antipa|thy
to all former practices. Among the&s;e, Hooper,
who afterwards &s;uffered for his religion with &s;uch ex|traordinary
conftancy, was chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed. This
man was appointed, during the reign of Edward, to the
&s;ee of Gloce&s;ter, and made no &s;cruple of accepting the
epi&s;copal office; but he refu&s;ed to be con&s;ecrated in the
epi&s;copal habits, the cymarre and rochette, which had
formerly, he &s;aid, been abu&s;ed to &s;uper&s;tition, and
which were thereby rendered unbecoming a true chri&s;|tian.
Cranmer and Ridley were &s;urprized at this ob|jection,
which oppo&s;ed the received practice, and even
the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws; and tho' young Edward, de&s;irous
to promote a man &s;o celebrated for his eloquence, his
zeal, and his morals, enjoined them to di&s;pen&s;e with
this ceremony, they &s;till continued re&s;olute to retain
it. Hooper then embraced the re&s;olution, rather to re|fu&s;e
the bi&s;hopric than cloath him&s;elf in tho&s;e hated
garments; but it was determined, that, for the &s;ake
of the example, he &s;hould not e&s;cape of ea&s;ily. He was
fir&s;t con&s;ined to Cranmer's hou&s;e, and then thrown
into pri&s;on, till he &s;hould con&s;ent to be a bi&s;hop on the
terms propo&s;ed: He was plyed with conferences, and
reprimands, and arguments: Bucer and Peter Martyr
and the mo&s;t celebrated foreign reformers were con&s;ult|ed
on this important que&s;tion: And a compromi&s;e,
with great difficulty, was at la&s;t made, that Hooper
&s;hould not be obliged to wear commonly the obnoxious
robes, but &s;hould agree to be con&s;ecrated in them, and
to u&s;e them during cathedral &s;ervice<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. II. p. 152. H$y$in, p. 90.</NOTE>: A conde&s;cen&s;ion
<PB N="158" REF="173">
not a little extraordinary in a man of &s;o inflexible, a &s;pirit
as this reformer.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame objection, which had ri&s;en with regard to
the epi&s;copal habits, had been moved again&s;t the ray|ment
of the inferior clergy; and the &s;urplice in particu|lar,
with the tippet and corner cap, was a great object
of abhorrence to many of the popular zealots<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 416.</NOTE> In vain
was it urged, that particular habits, as well as po&s;tures
and ceremonies, being con&s;tantly u&s;ed by the clergy,
and employed in religious &s;ervice, acquire a veneration
in the eyes of the people, appear &s;acred to their appre|hen&s;ions,
exite their devotion, and contract a kind of
my&s;terious virtue, which attaches the affections of men
to the national and e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip: That in order
to produce this effect an uniformity in the&s;e particulars
is requi&s;ite, and even a per&s;everance, as far as po&s;&s;ible
in the former practice: And that the nation would be
happy, if, by retaining the&s;e inoffen&s;ive ob&s;ervances,
they could engage the people to renounce willingly what
was hurtful or pernicious in the antient &s;uper&s;tition
The&s;e arguments, which had influence with wi&s;e men,
were the very rea&s;ons, which engaged the violent pro|te&s;tants
to reject the habits. They pu&s;hed matters to
a total oppo&s;ition with the church of Rome: Every
compliance, they &s;aid, was a &s;ymbolizing with An|tichri&s;t<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 416.</NOTE>: And this &s;pirit was carried &s;o far by &s;ome re|formers,
that in a national remon&s;trance; which was
afterwards made by the church of Scotland again&s;t the&s;e
habits, it was a&s;ked, &startq;What has Chri&s;t Je&s;us to do
with Belial? What has darkne&s;s to do with light?
If &s;urplices, corner caps, and tippets have been
badges of idolaters in the very act of their idolatry;
why &s;hould the preacher of Chri&s;tian liberty, and
the open rebuker of all &s;uper&s;tition partake with the
dregs of the Romi&s;h bea&s;t? Yea, who is there that
ought not rather to be afraid of taking in his hand or
on his forehead the print and mark of that odious

bea&s;t<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 565. Knox. p. 402.</NOTE>?&endq; But this application was rejected by the
Engli&s;h church.</P>
<P>THERE was only one in&s;tance, where the &s;pirit of
contradiction to the Romani&s;ts took place univer&s;ally in
England: The altar was removed from the wall, was
placed in the middle of the church, and was thence|forth
denominated the communion-table. The rea&s;on,
why this reformation met with &s;uch general compliance,
was, that the nobility and gentry got thereby a pre|tence
for making &s;poil of the plate, ve&s;tures, and
rich ornaments, which belonged to the altars<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Heylin, preface, p. 3. Hi&s;t. p. 106.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE di&s;putes, which had been &s;tarted during the
reign of Edward, were carried abroad by the prote&s;tants,
who fled from the per&s;ecutions of Mary; and as their
zeal had received an encrea&s;e from the furious cruelty
of their enemies, they were generally inclined to carry
their oppo&s;ition to the utmo&s;t extremity again&s;t the
practices of the church of Rome. Their communi|cation
with Calvin and the other reformers, who fol|lowed
the di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip of Geneva, confirmed
them farther in this ob&s;tinate reluctance; and tho' &s;ome
of the refugees, particularly tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed at Frank|fort,
&s;till adhered to King Edward's liturgy, the pre|vailing
&s;pirit carried the&s;e confe&s;&s;ors to &s;eek a &s;till farther
reformation. On the acce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth, they
returned to their native country; and being regarded
with general veneration on account of their zeal and
pa&s;t &s;ufferings, they ventured to in&s;i&s;t on the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of their projected model; nor did they want coun|tenance
from many con&s;iderable per&s;ons in the Queen's
council. But the Prince&s;s her&s;elf, &s;o far from being
willing to de&s;poil religion of the few ornaments and
ceremonies, which remained in it, was of her&s;elf rather
inclined to bring the public wor&s;hip &s;till nearer to the
Romi&s;h ritual<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">When Nowel, one of her chaplains, had &s;poke le&s;s $word$ in a $rmon, $word$ before her of the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, &s;he called a$$$d to him from her clo&s;et window, commanding him to retire from that ungodly digre&s;&s;ion and $ return unto his text.

<PB N="160" REF="177">
had already gone too far in &s;haking off tho&s;e forms and
ob&s;ervances, which, without di&s;tracting men of more
refined apprehen&s;ions, tend in a very innocent manner
to allure, and amu&s;e, and engage the vulgar. She
took care to have a law for uniformity &s;trictly enacted:
She was empowered by the parliament to add any new
ceremonies, which &s;he thought proper: And tho' &s;he
was &s;paring in the exerci&s;e of this prerogative, &s;he
continued rigid in exacting an ob&s;ervance of the e&s;tab|li&s;hed
laws, and in puni&s;hing all nonconformity. The
zealots, therefore, who harboured a &s;ecret antipathy to
the epi&s;copal order and to the whole liturgy, were oblig|ed,
in a great mea&s;ure, to conceal the&s;e &s;entiments,
which would have been regarded as highly audacious
and criminal; and they confined their avowed objecti|ons
to the &s;urplice, the confirmation of children, the
&s;ign of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m, the ring in marriage, kneel|ing
at the &s;acramet, and bowing at the name of Je&s;us.
So fruitle&s;s is it for &s;overeigns to watch with a rigid care
over orthodoxy, and to employ the &s;word in religious
controver&s;y, that the work, perpetually renewed, is
perpetually to beigin; and a garb, a ge&s;ture, nay, a
metaphy&s;ical or grammatical di&s;tinction, when rendered
important by the di&s;putes of theologians and the zeal of
the magi&s;trate, is &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the unity of the
church, and even the peace of &s;ociety. The&s;e contro|ver&s;ies
had already excited &s;uch ferment among the
people, that in &s;ome places they refu&s;ed to frequent the
churches where the habits and ceremonies were u&s;ed,
would not &s;alute the conforming clergy, and proceeded
&s;o far as to revile them in the &s;treets, &s;o &s;pit in their
<PB N="161" REF="178">
faces, and to u&s;e them with all manner of contumely<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgift, p. 460.</NOTE>.
And while the &s;overeign authority checked the&s;e ex|ce&s;&s;es,
the fl$me was confined, not extingui&s;hed; and
burning fiercer from confinement, it bur&s;t out in the
&s;ucceeding reigns to the de&s;truction of the church and
monarchy.</P>
<P>ALL enthu&s;ia&s;ts, indulging them&s;elves in rapturous
flights, exta&s;ies, vi&s;ions, in&s;pirations, have a natural
aver&s;ion to epi&s;copal authority, to ceremonies, rites,
and forms, which they denominate &s;uper&s;ti$on, or beg|garly
elements, and which &s;eem to re&s;train the liberal
effu&s;ions of their zeal and devotion: But there was
another &s;et of opinions adopted by the&s;e innovators,
which rendered them in a peculiar manner the object
of Elizabeth's aver&s;ion. The &s;ame bold and daring
&s;pirit, which accompanied them in their addre&s;&s;es to the
divinity, appeared in their political &s;peculations; and
the principles of civil liberty, which, during &s;ome
reigns, had been very little avowed in the nation, and
which were totally incompatible with the pre&s;ent ex|orbitant
prerogative, had been &s;trongly adopted by this
new &s;ect. Scarce any &s;overeign before Elizabeth, and
none after her, carried higher, both in &s;peculation and
practice, the authority of the crown; and the puritans
($o the&s;e &s;ectaries were called, on account of their pre|tending
to a greater purity of wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline)
could not recommend them&s;elves wor&s;e to her favour,
than by preaching up the doctrine of re&s;i&s;ting or re|&s;training
princes. From all the&s;e motives, the Queen
neglected no opportunity of depre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e zealous
inn vators; and while they were coun$$nanced by
&s;ome of her mo&s;t favour$d mini&s;ters, Cecil, Leice&s;ter,
Knolles, Bedford, Wa$&s;ingham, &s;he never was, to
the end of her life, reconciled to their principles and
practices.</P>
<P>WE have thought proper to in&s;ert in this place an
<PB N="162" REF="179">
account of the ri&s;e and the genius of the puritans;
becau&s;e Camden marks the pre&s;ent years, as the period
when they began to make them&s;elves con&s;iderable in
England. We now return to our narration.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Nor&s;olk was the only peer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1569. Duke of Norfolk's con&s;piracy.</NOTE> who
enjoyed the highe&s;t title of nobility; and as there were
at pre&s;ent no princes of the blood, the &s;plendor of his
family, the opulence of his fortune, and the extent of
his influence, had rendered him without compari&s;on
the fir&s;t &s;ubject in England. The qualities of his mind
corre&s;ponded to his high &s;tation: Beneficent, affable,
generous, he had acquired the affections of the people;
prudent, moderate, ob&s;equious, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without
givning jealou&s;y the good graces of his &s;overeign. His
grandfather and father had long been regarded as the
leaders of the catholics; and this hereditary attach|ment,
joined to the alliances of blood, had procured
him the friend&s;hip of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men of that
party: But as he had been educated among the refor|mers,
was &s;incerely devoted to their principles, and
maintained that &s;trict decorum and regularity of life,
by which the prote&s;tants were at that time di&s;tingui&s;h|ed;
he thereby enjoyed the rare felicity of being po|pular
even with the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite factions. The height
of his pro&s;perity alone was the &s;ource of his misfortunes,
and engaged him into attempts, from which his virtue
and prudence would naturally have for ever kept him
at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>NORFOLK was at this time a windower; and being
of a &s;uitable age to e&s;pou&s;e the Queen of Scots, that
marriage had appeared &s;o natural, that it had occurred
to &s;everal of his friends and tho&s;e of that prince&s;s: But
the fir&s;t per&s;on, who, after &s;ecretary Lidington, opened
the &s;cheme to the duke is &s;aid to be the earl of Murray,
before his departure for Scotland<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 36, 37.</NOTE> That nobleman
&s;et before Norfolk both the advantage of compo&s;ing the
differences in Scotland by an alliance which would be
<PB N="163" REF="180">
&s;o generally accceptable, and the pro&s;pect of reaping the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of England; and in order to bind Norfolk's
intere&s;t the fa&s;ter with Mary's, he propo&s;ed that the
duke's daughter &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the young king of Scot|land.
The obtaining previou&s;ly Elizabeth's con&s;ent,
was regarded both by Murray and Norfolk as a circum|&s;tance
e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ucce&s;s of their project; and
all circum&s;tances being adju&s;ted between them, Murray
took care, by the means of Sir Rober Melvil, to have
the de&s;ign communicated to the Queen of Scots.
That prince&s;s replied, that the vexations, which &s;he
had met with in her two la&s;t marriages, had made her
more inclined to lead a &s;ingle life, but &s;he was deter|mined
to &s;acifice her own inclinations to the public
welfare: And therefore, &s;o &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould be le|gally
divorced from Bothwell, &s;he would be determin|ed
by the opinoin of her nobility and people in the
choice of another hu&s;band<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 40, 41.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is probable, that Murray was not &s;incere in this
propo&s;al. He had two motives to engage him to di&s;|&s;imulation.
He knew the danger, which he mu&s;t
run in his return thro' the North of England, from the
power of the Earls of Northumberland and We&s;tmore|land,
Mary's partizans in that country; and he dread|ed
an in&s;urrection in Scotland from the duke of Chat|elrault,
and the earls of Argyle and Huntley, whom
&s;he had appointed her lieutenants during her ab&s;ence.
By the&s;e feigned appearances of friend&s;hip, he both en|gaged
Norfolk to write in his favour to the northern
nobleman<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">State Trials, p. 76, 78.</NOTE> and he per&s;uaded the Queen of Scots to
give her lieutenants permi&s;&s;ion, and even advice, to make
a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities with the regent's party<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, tho' he had agreed, that Eli|zabeth's
con&s;ent &s;hould be previou&s;ly obtained, before
the completion of his marriage, had good rea&s;on to ap|prehend,
that he never &s;hould prevail with her volun|tarily
<PB N="164" REF="181">
to make that conce&s;&s;ion. He knew her perpetual
and unrelenting jealou&s;y again&s;t her heir and rival; he
was acquainted with her former reluctance to all pro|po&s;als
of marriage with the Queen of Scots; he fore&s;aw,
that that prince&s;s's e&s;pou&s;ing a per&s;on of his power, and
character, and intere&s;t, would give the greate&s;t um|brage;
and as it would then become nece&s;&s;ary to re|in&s;tate
Mary in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her throne on &s;ome tole|rable
terms, and even to endeavour the re-e&s;tabli&s;hing
her character, he dreaded, that Elizabeth, who&s;e po|litics
had now taken a different turn, would never agree
to &s;uch indulgent and generous conditions. He there|fore
attempted previou&s;ly to gain the con&s;ent and ap|probation
of &s;everal of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable nobility;
and he was &s;ucce&s;sful with the earls of Pembroke,
Arundel, Derby, Bedford, Shrew&s;bury, Southampton,
Northumberland, We&s;tmoreland, Su&s;&s;ex<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 55. Camden, p. 419. Spot&s;wood, p. 230.</NOTE>. The lord
Lumley, and Sir Nicholas Throcmorton embraced
cordially the propo&s;al: Even the earl of Leice&s;ter, Eli|zabeth's
declared favourite, who had formerly enter|tained
&s;ome views of e&s;pou&s;ing Mary, willingly re|&s;igned
all his preten&s;ions, and &s;eemed to enter zea|lou&s;ly
into Norfolk's intere&s;ts<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 535.</NOTE>. There were other
motives, be&s;ides affection to the duke, which produced
this general combination of the nobility.</P>
<P>SIR William Cecil, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, was the mo&s;t
vigilant, active, and prudent mini&s;ter ever known in
England; and as he was governed by no views but
the intere&s;ts of his &s;overeign, which he inflexibly pur|&s;ued,
his authority over her became every day more pre|dominant.
Ever cool him&s;elf, and uninfluenced by
prejudice or affection, he checked tho&s;e &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion,
and &s;ometimes of caprice, to which &s;he was &s;ubject;
and if he failed of per&s;wading her in the fir&s;t movement,
his per&s;everance, and remon&s;trances, and arguments
were &s;ure at la&s;t to recommend them&s;elves to her &s;ound
<PB N="165" REF="182">
di&s;cernment. The more credit he gained with his
mi&s;tre&s;s, the more was he expo&s;ed to the envy of her
other coun&s;ellors; and as he had been &s;uppo&s;ed to adopt
the intere&s;ts of the hou&s;e of Suffolk, who&s;e claim &s;eem|ed
to carry with it no danger to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;h|ment,
his enemies, in oppo&s;ition to him, were natu|rally
led to attach them&s;elves to the Queen of Scots.
Elizabeth &s;aw, without unea&s;ine&s;s, this emulation
among her courtiers, which &s;erved to augment her
authority: and tho &s;he &s;upported Cecil, wherever
matters came to extremity, and di&s;&s;ipated every con|&s;piracy
again&s;t him, particularly one laid about this
time to have him thrown into the Tower on &s;ome pre|tence
or other<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 417.</NOTE>, &s;he never gave him &s;uch unlimited
confidence as might enable him entirely to cru&s;h his
adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>NORFOLK, &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty, which he mu&s;t
meet with in controling Cecil's councils, e&s;pecially
where they concurred with the inclinations, as well as
intere&s;ts of the Queen, dur&s;t not open to her his inten|tions
of marrying the Queen of Scots; but proceeded
&s;till in the &s;ame cour&s;e of encrea&s;ing his intere&s;t in the
kingdom, and engaging more of the nobility to take
part in his mea&s;ures. A letter was wrote to Mary
by Leice&s;ter, and &s;igned by &s;everal men of the fir&s;t
rank, recommending Norfolk for her hu&s;band, and
&s;tipulating conditions for the advantage of both king|doms;
particularly, that &s;he &s;hould give &s;ufficient &s;urety
to Elizabeth, and the heirs of her body, for the free
enjoyment of the crown of England; that a perpetual
league, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, be made between their
realms and &s;ubjects; that the prote&s;tant religion be
e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in Scotland; and that &s;he &s;hould
grant an amne&s;ty to her rebels in that kingdom<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 50. Camden, p. 420. Haynes, p. 535, 539.</NOTE>. When
Mary returned a favourable an&s;wer to this application,
Norfolk employed him&s;elf with new ardor in the exe|cution
<PB N="166" REF="183">
of his project; and be&s;ides &s;ecuring the intere&s;ts
of many of the con&s;iderable gentry and nobility who
re&s;ided at court, he wrote letters to &s;uch as lived at their
country &s;eats, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t authority in the
&s;everal counties<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p. 62.</NOTE> The Kings of France and Spain,
who intere&s;ted them&s;elves extremely in Mary's cau&s;e,
were &s;ecretly con&s;ulted, and expre&s;&s;ed their approbation
of the&s;e mea&s;ures<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 63.</NOTE> And tho' Elizabeth's con&s;ent was
always &s;uppo&s;ed as a previous condition to the fini&s;hing
this alliance, it was apparently Norfolk's intention, when
he proceeded &s;uch lengths without con&s;ulting her, to
render his party &s;o &s;trong, that it &s;hould no longer be in
her power to refu&s;e it<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;o exten&s;ive a con&s;piracy
could entirely e&s;cape the Queen's vigilance and that
of Cecil. She dropt &s;everal &s;urmi&s;es to the duke,
by which he might learn, that &s;he was acquainted
with his de&s;igns; and &s;he frequently warned him to
beware on what pillow he repo&s;ed his head<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 420 Spot&s;wood, p. 231.</NOTE>. But he
never had the prudence or the courage to open to her
his full intentions. Certain intelligence of this dange|rous
combination was given her fir&s;t by Leice&s;ter,
then by Murray<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p. 7. It appears by Haynes, p. 521, 525, that Queen Eliza|beth had heard rumours of Norfolk's dealing with Murray; and charged the latter to inform her of the whole truth, which he accordingly did. See al|&s;o the earl of Murray's letter produced on Norfolk's trial.</NOTE>, who, if ever he was &s;incere in pro|moting
Norfolk's marriage, which is much to be &s;u&s;|pected,
had at lea&s;t propo&s;ed, for his own &s;afety and
that of his party, that Elizabeth &s;hould, in reality as
well as in appearance, be entire arbiter of the con|ditions,
and &s;hould not have her con&s;ent extorted
by any confederacy of her own &s;ubjects. This infor|mation
gave great alarm to the court of England; and
the more &s;o, as tho&s;e intrigues were attended with
<PB N="167" REF="184">
other circum&s;tances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1569</NOTE> of which, it is probable, Eliza|beth
was not wholly ignorant.</P>
<P>AMONG the nobility and gentry, that &s;eemed to en|ter
into Norfolk's views, there were many, who were
zealou&s;ly attached to the catholic religion, who had
no other de&s;ign than that of re&s;toring Mary to her li|berty,
and who would gladly, by a combination with
foreign powers, or even at the expence of a civil war,
have placed her on the throne of England. The earls
of Northumberland and We&s;tmoreland, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
great power in the north, were leaders of this party:
and the former nobleman made offer to the Queen of
Scots, by Leonard Dacres, brother to lord Dacres,
that he would free her from confinement, and convey
her to Scotland or any other place, to which &s;he &s;hould
think proper to retire<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p. 76.</NOTE>. Sir Thomas and Sir Ed|ward
Stanley, &s;ons to the earl of Derby, Sir Thomas
Gerrard, Rol&s;tone, and other gentlemen, who&s;e in|tere&s;t
lay in the neighbourhood of the place where
Mary re&s;ided, concurred in the &s;ame views, and re|quired,
that, in order to facilitate the execution of
the &s;cheme, a diver&s;ion &s;hould, in the mean time, be
made from the &s;ide of Flanders<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 98.</NOTE>. Norfolk di&s;courag|ed,
and even in appearance &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the&s;e con&s;pi|racies;
both becau&s;e his duty to Elizabeth would not
allow him to think of effecting his purpo&s;e by rebel|lion,
and becau&s;e he fore&s;aw, that, if the Queen of
Scots came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e men, they would
rather choo&s;e for her hu&s;band the King of Spain, or
&s;ome foreign prince, who had power, as well as incli|nation,
to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the catholic religion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN men of honour and good principles, like
the duke of Norfolk, engage in dangerous enterpri|zes,
they are commonly &s;o unfortunate as to be crimi|nal
by halves; and while they ballance between the
execution of their de&s;igns and their remor&s;es, their
fear of puni&s;hment and their hope of pardon, they ren|der
<PB N="168" REF="185">
them&s;elves an ea&s;y prey to their enemies. The
duke, in order to repre&s;s the &s;urmizes, &s;pread again&s;t
him, &s;poke contemptuou&s;ly to Elizabeth of the Scots
alliance; affirmed that his e&s;tate in England was more
valuable than the revenue of a kingdom wa&s;ted by
civil wars and factions; and declared, that, when he
amu&s;ed him&s;elf in his own-tennis court at Norwi$h
amid&s;t his friends and va&s;&s;als, he e&s;teemed him&s;elf at
lea&s;t a petty prince, and was fully contented with his
condition<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 420.</NOTE>. Finding, that he did not convince her
by the&s;e a&s;&s;everations, and that he was looked on with
a jealous eye by the courtiers, he retired to his coun|try-&s;eat
without taking leave<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 528.</NOTE>. He &s;oon after repent|ed
of this mea&s;ure, and &s;et out on his return to court,
with a view of u&s;ing every expedient to regain the
Queen's good graces; but he was met at St. Albans
by Fitz-Garret, lieutenant of the band of pen&s;ioners,
by whom he was conveyed to Burnham, three miles
from Wind&s;or, where the court then re&s;ided<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 339.</NOTE>. He
was &s;oon after committed to the Tower, under the
cu&s;tody of Sir Henry Nevil<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 421. Haynes, p. 540.</NOTE>. Le&s;ley, bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s,
the Queen of Scots amba&s;&s;ador, was examined and
confronted with Norfolk before the council<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p. 80.</NOTE>. The
earl of Pembroke was confined to his own hou&s;e:
Arundel, Lumley, and Throcmorton were taken in|to
cu&s;tody. The Queen of Scots her&s;elf was remov|ed
to Coventry; all acce&s;s to her was, during &s;ome
time, more &s;trictly prohibited; and the vi&s;count He|reford
was joined to the earls of Shrew&s;bury and
Huntingdon, in the office of guarding her.</P>
<P>ARUMOUR had been very generally diffu&s;ed in the
north of an intended rebellion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrec|tions in the north.</NOTE> and the earl of Su&s;&s;ex,
pre&s;ident of York, alarmed with the danger &s;ent for
Northumberland and We&s;tmoreland, in order to ex|amine
them; but not finding any proof again&s;t them,
<PB N="169" REF="186">
he allowed them to depart. The report meanwhile
gained ground daily; and many appearances of its
reality being di&s;covered, orders were di&s;patched by
Elizabeth to the&s;e two noblemen, to appear at court,
and an&s;wer for their conduct<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 552.</NOTE> They had already
proceeded &s;o far in their criminal de&s;igns, that they
dared not to tru&s;t them&s;elves in her hands: They had
prepared mea&s;ures for a rebellion; had communicated
their de&s;ign to Mary and her mini&s;ters<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 595. Strype, vol. II. append. p. 30. MS. in the Advocate's Library from Cott. Lib. Cal. c. 9.</NOTE>; had entered
into a corre&s;pondence with the duke of Alva, gover|nor
of the Low Countries; had obtained his promi&s;e
of a reinforcement of troops, and of a &s;upply of arms
and ammunition; and had prevailed on him to &s;end
over to London Chiapini Vitelli, one of his mo&s;t fa|mous
captains, on pretence of adju&s;ting &s;ome differ|ences
with the Queen, but in reality with a view of
putting him at the head of the northern rebels. The
&s;ummons &s;ent to the two earls, precipitated the ri|&s;ing
before they were fully prepared; and Northum|berland
remained in &s;u&s;pence between oppo&s;ite dan|gers,
when he was informed, that &s;ome of his ene|mies
were on the way with a commi&s;&s;ion to arre&s;t
him. He took hor&s;e in&s;tantly, and ha&s;tened to his
a&s;&s;ociate We&s;tmoreland, whom he found &s;urround|ed
with his friends and va&s;&s;als, and deliberating with
regard to the mea&s;ures, which he &s;hould follow in the
pre&s;ent emergence. They determined to begin the in|&s;urrection
without delay; and the great credit of the&s;e
two noblemen, with that zeal for the catholic religion,
which &s;till prevailed in the neighbourhood, &s;oon drew
together multitudes of the common people. They
publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, in which they maintained, that
they intended to attempt nothing again&s;t the Queen,
to whom they vowed un&s;haken allegiance; and
that their &s;ole aim was to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the religion
of their ance&s;tors, to remove evil coun&s;ellors, and to

re&s;tore the duke of Norfolk and other faithful peers
to their liberty and to the Queen's favour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 169. Strype, vol. I. p. 547.</NOTE>. Their
number amounted to four thou&s;and foot and &s;ixteen
hundred hor&s;e, and they expected the concurrence of
all the catholics in England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 663.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen was not negligent in her defence, and
&s;he had beforehand, from her prudent and wi&s;e con|duct,
acquired the general good will of her people,
the be&s;t &s;ecurity of a &s;overeign; in&s;omuch that even
the catholics in mo&s;t counties expre&s;&s;ed an affection
for her &s;ervice<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 170. Digges, p. 4.</NOTE>; and the duke of Norfolk him&s;elf,
tho' he had lo&s;t her favour, and lay in confinement,
was not wanting, as far as his &s;ituation permitted, to
promote the levies among his friends and retainers.
Su&s;&s;ex, attended with the earls of Rutland, the lords
Hun&s;don, Evers, and Willoughby of Parham, marched
again&s;t the rebels at the head of &s;even thou&s;and men,
and found them already advanced to the bi&s;hoprick
of Durham, of which they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
They retired before him to Hexham; and hearing that
the earl of Warwic and lord Clinton were advancing
again&s;t them with a greater body, they found no other
expedient but to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves without &s;triking
a blow. The common people retired to their hou&s;es:
The leaders fled into Scotland. Northumberland
was found &s;kulking in that country, and was confined
by Murray to the ca&s;tle of Lochlevin. We&s;tmoreland
received &s;helter from the chieftanes of the Kers and
Scots, partizans of Mary; and per&s;uaded them to make
an inroad into England, with a view of exciting a
quarrel between the two kingdoms. After they had
committed great ravages, they retreated to their own
country; and We&s;tmoreland made his e&s;cape into Flan|ders,
where he was protected. This &s;udden and pre|cipitate
rebellion was followed &s;oon after by another
&s;till more imprudent, rai&s;ed by Leonard Dacres. Lord
<PB N="171" REF="188">
Hu$&s;don, at the head of the garri&s;on of Berwic, was
able, without other a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to quell the&s;e rebels.
Great &s;everity was exerci&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e, who had
taken part in the&s;e ra&s;h enterprizes. Sixty-&s;ix petty
con&s;tables were hanged<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 423.</NOTE>; and no le&s;s than eight
hundred per&s;ons are &s;aid, on the whole, to have &s;uffer|ed
by the hands of the executioner<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 82.</NOTE>. But the Queen
was &s;o well plea&s;ed with Norfolk's behaviour, that &s;he
relea&s;ed him from the Tower, allowed him to live un|der
&s;ome &s;hew of confinement in his own hou&s;e, and
only exacted a promi&s;e from him not to proceed any
farther in his preten&s;ions to marriage with the Queen
of Scots<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 98. Camden, p. 429. Haynes, p. 597.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH now found that the detention of Mary
was attended with all the ill con&s;equences, which &s;he
had fore&s;een when &s;he fir&s;t embraced that mea&s;ure.
This latter prince&s;s recovering, by means of her mi&s;|fortunes
and her own natural good &s;en&s;e, from that de|lirium,
in which &s;he &s;eems to have been thrown during
her attachment to Bothwel, had behaved with &s;uch
mode&s;ty and judgment, and even dignity, that every$
one, who approached her, was charmed with her demea|nor;
and her friends were enabled, on &s;ome plau&s;ible
grounds, to deny the reality of all tho&s;e crimes, which
had been imputed to her<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 232. Haynes, p. 511.</NOTE>. The compa&s;&s;ion for her
&s;ituation, and the nece&s;&s;ity of effecting her relief, prov|ed
an incitement among all her partizans to be active
in promoting her cau&s;e; and as her delivery from cap|tivity,
it was thought, could no wi&s;e be effected but by
attempts, dangerous to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government, Eli|zabeth
had rea&s;on to expect little tranquillity &s;o long
as the Scotti&s;h Queen remained a pri&s;oner in her hands.
But as this inconvenience had been preferred to the
danger of allowing that prince&s;s to enjoy her liberty,
and to &s;eek relief in all the catholic courts of Europe, it
<PB N="172" REF="189">
behoved the Queen to &s;upport the mea&s;ure which &s;he had
adopted, and to guard by every prudent expedient
again&s;t the mi&s;chiefs to which it was expo&s;ed. She &s;till
flattered Mary with hopes of her protection, maintain|ed
an ambiguous conduct between that Queen and her
enemies in Scotland, negotiated perpetually concerning
the terms of her re&s;toration, made con&s;tant profe&s;&s;ions
of friend&s;hip to her; and by the&s;e arti$ices endeavoured
both to prevent her from making any de&s;perate efforts
for her delivery, and to &s;atisfy the French and Spani&s;h
amba&s;&s;adors, who never intermitted their &s;ollicitations,
&s;ometimes accompanied with menaces, in her favour.
This deceit was received with the &s;ame deceit by the
Queen of Scots: Profe&s;&s;ions of confidence were returned
by profe&s;&s;ions equally in&s;incere: And while an appear|ance
of friend&s;hip was maintained on both &s;ides&punc; the
animo&s;ity and jealou&s;y, which had long prevailed be|tween
them, was every day becoming more inveterate
and incurable. The&s;e two prince&s;&s;es, in addre&s;s, capa|city,
activity, and &s;pirit, were nearly a match for each
other; but unhappily, Mary, be&s;ides her pre&s;ent $word$
condition, was always inferior in per&s;onal conduct and
di&s;cretion, as well as in power, to her illu&s;trious ri|val.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH
and Mary wrote at the &s;ame time letters
to the regent. The Queen of Scots de&s;ired, that her
marriage with Bothwel might be examined, and a di|vorce
be legally pronounced between them. The Queen
of England gave Murray the choice of three conditions;
that Mary &s;hould be re&s;tored to her dignity on certain
terms; that &s;he &s;hould be a&s;&s;ociated with her &s;on, and
the admini&s;tration remain in the regent's hands, till the
young prince &s;hould come to years of di&s;cretion; or
that &s;he &s;hould be allowed to live at liberty as a private
per&s;on in Scotland, and have an honourable &s;ettlement
made in her favour<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">MSS. in the advacate's library. A. 329. p. 137. from Cott. Lib. $word$. c. $.</NOTE>. Murray &s;ummoned a conventi|on,
<PB N="173" REF="190">
in order to deliberate on the&s;e propo&s;als of the two
Queens. No an&s;wer was made by them to Mary's letter,
on pretence that &s;he had there maintained the &s;tyle of
a &s;overeign, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to her &s;ubjects; but in
reality, becau&s;e they &s;aw that her reque&s;t was calculated
to prepare the way for a marriage with Norfolk, or &s;ome
powerful prince, who could &s;upport her cau&s;e, and re|&s;tore
her to the throne. They replied to Elizabeth,
that the two former conditions were &s;o derogatory to
the royal authority of their prince, that they could not
&s;o much as deliberate concerning them: The third alone
could be the &s;ubject of treaty. It was evident, that
Elizabeth, in propo&s;ing conditions &s;o unequal in their
importance, invited the Scots to a refu&s;al of tho&s;e which
were mo&s;t advontageous to Mary; and as it was diffi|cult,
if not impo&s;&s;ible, to adju&s;t all the terms of the
third, &s;o as to render it &s;ecure and eligible to all parties,
it was concluded that &s;he was not &s;incere in any of
them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Spor&s;wood, p. 230, 231. Le&s;ly, p, 71.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is pretended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1570</NOTE> that Murray had entered into a pri|vate
negociation with the Queen, to get Mary deli|vered
into his hands<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 425. Le&s;ly, p. 83.</NOTE>; and as Elizabeth &s;ound the de|tention of her in England &s;o dangerous, it is probable,
that &s;he would have been plea&s;ed, on any honourable
or &s;afe terms, to rid her&s;elf of a pri&s;oner who gave her
&s;o much inquietude<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">By Murden's &s;tate papers, publi&s;hed after the printing of this pa&s;&s;age, it appears, that an agreement had been made between Elizabeth and the regent for the delivery of Mary.

Killigrew was in&s;tructed to take good &s;ecurity from the regent, that that Queen &s;hould be tryed for her crimes, and that the &s;entence &s;hould be execut|ed upon her.

in the beginning than in the end of his life.
His manners were rough and au&s;tere; and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
not that perfect integrity, which frequently accom|panies,
and can alone atone for, that unamiable cha|racter.</P>
<P>By
the death of the regent, Scotland relap&s;ed into
its former anarchy. Mary's party a&s;&s;embled together
and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Edinburgh. The ca&s;|tle,
commanded by Kirkaldy of Grange, &s;eemed to fa|vour
her cau&s;e; and as many of the principal nobility
had embraced that &s;ide, it became probable, tho' the
people were in general aver&s;e to her, that her authority
might again acquire the a&s;cendant. To check its pro|gre&s;s,
Elizabeth di&s;patched Su&s;&s;ex, with an army, to the
North, under colour of cha&s;tizing the ravages commit|ted
by the borderers. He entered Scotland, and laid
wa&s;te the lands of the Kers and Scots, &s;eized the ca&s;tle
of Hume, and committed ho&s;tilities on all Mary's par|tizans,
who, he &s;aid, had offended his mi&s;tre&s;s, by har|bouring
the Engli&s;h rebels. Sir William Drury was
afterwards &s;ent with a body of troops, and he threw
down the hou&s;es of the Hamiltons, who were engaged
in the &s;ame faction. The Engli&s;h armies were after|wards
recalled by agreement with the Queen of Scots,
who promi&s;ed, that no French troops &s;hould be intro|duced
into Scotland, and that the Engli&s;h rebels &s;hould
be delivered up to the Queen by her partizans<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p. 91.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the Queen, covering her&s;elf with the pre|tence
of revenging her own quarrel, &s;o far contributed
to &s;upport the party of the young King, &s;he was cauti|ous
not to declare openly again&s;t the Queen of Scots,
and &s;he even &s;ent a reque&s;t, which was equal to a com|mand,
to the enemies of that prince&s;s, not to elect,

Lenox, the King's grandfather, was, therefore, cho&s;en
temporary governor, under the title of Lieutenant.
Hearing afterwards that Mary's partizans, in&s;tead of
delivering up We&s;tmoreland, and the other-fugitives, as
they had promi&s;ed, had allowed them to e&s;cape into
Flanders; &s;he permitted the King's party to give Lenox
the title of regent<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 241.</NOTE>, and &s;he &s;ent Randolf, as her re&s;i|dent,
to maintain a corre&s;pondence with him. But
notwith&s;tanding this &s;tep, taken in favour of Mary's
enemies, &s;he never laid a&s;ide her ambiguous conduct, or
quitted the preten&s;ions of amity to that prince&s;s. Be|ing
importuned by the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, and her other
agents, as well as by foreign amba&s;&s;adors, &s;he twice pro|cured
a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms between the Scots factions,
and by that means &s;topped the hands of the regent, who
was likely to obtain advantages over the oppo&s;ite par|ty<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 243.</NOTE>. By the&s;e &s;eeming contrarieties &s;he kept alive the
factions in Scotland, increa&s;ed their mutual animo&s;ity,
and rendered the whole country a &s;cene of deva&s;tation
and of mi&s;ery<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Crawford, p. 136.</NOTE>. She had no intention to conquer the
kingdom, and con&s;equently no intere&s;t or de&s;ign to in|&s;tigate
the parties again&s;t each other; but this con&s;e|quence
was an accidental effect of her cautious politics,
by which &s;he was engaged, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to keep on
good terms with the Queen of Scots, and never to vi|olate
the appearances of friend&s;hip with her, at lea&s;t
tho&s;e of neutrality<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sir James Melvil, p. 108, 109, a&s;cribes to Elizabeth a po&s;itive de&s;ign of animating the Scots factions again&s;t each other; but his evidence is too incon&s;iderable to counterballance many other authorities, and is, indeed, contrary to her &s;ub&s;equent conduct, as well as her intere&s;ts, and the nece&s;&s;ity of her &s;ituation. It was plainly her intere&s;t, that the King's party &s;hould prevail, and nothing could have engaged her to &s;top their progre&s;s, or even forbear from openly a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, but her intention of &s;till amu&s;ing the Queen of Scots, by the hopes of being peaceably re&s;tored to her throne.

THE better to amu&s;e Mary with the pro&s;pect of an
accommodation, Cecil and Sir Walter Mildway were
&s;ent to her with propo&s;als from Elizabeth. The terms
were &s;omewhat rigorous, &s;uch as a captive Queen
might expect from a jealous rival; and they thereby
bore the greater appearance of &s;incerity on the part of
the Engli&s;h court. It was required, that the Queen
of Scots, be&s;ides renouncing all title to the crown of
England during the life-time of Elizabeth, &s;hould make
a perpetual league, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, between
the kingdoms; that &s;he &s;hould marry no Engli&s;hman
without Elizabeth's con&s;ent, nor any other per&s;on
without the con&s;ent of the &s;tates of Scotland; that re
dre&s;s &s;hould be made for the late ravages committed in
England; that ju&s;tice &s;hould be executed on the mur|derers
of the late King; that the young prince &s;hould
be &s;ent into England, to be educated there; that &s;ix ho&s;|tages,
all of them noblemen, &s;hould be delivered to the
Queen of England, with the ca&s;tle of Hume, and &s;ome
other fortre&s;s, for the &s;ecurity of performance<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 245. Le&s;ly, p. 101s.</NOTE> Such
were the conditions upon which Elizabeth promi&s;ed to
contribute her endeavours towards the re&s;toration of
the depo&s;ed Queen. The nece&s;&s;ity of Mary's affairs
obliged her to con&s;ent to them; and the Kings of
France and Spain, as well as the pope, when con&s;ulted
by her, approved of her conduct; chiefly on account of
the civil wars by which all Europe was at that time agi|tated,
and which incapacitated the catholic princes
from giving her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ly, p. 109. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH's commi&s;&s;ioners propo&s;ed al&s;o to Mary
a plan of accommodation with her &s;ubjects in Scotland;
and after &s;ome rea&s;oning on that head, it was agreed, that
the Queen &s;hould require Lenox, the regent, to &s;end up
commi&s;&s;ioners, to treat of conditions under her mediation.
The partizans of Mary $oa&s;ted, that all terms were fully
&s;ettled with the court of England, and that the Scots
<PB N="177" REF="194">
rebels would &s;oon be con&s;trained to &s;ubmit to the re&s;to|ration
of their &s;overeign: But Elizabeth took care that
the&s;e rumours &s;hould meet with no credit, and that the
King's party &s;hould not be di&s;couraged, nor &s;ink too
low in their demands. Cecil wrote to inform the regent,
that all the Queen of England's propo&s;als, &s;o far from
being fixed and irrevocable, were to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed anew
in the conference; and de&s;ired him to &s;end commi&s;&s;io|ners,
who &s;hould be con&s;tant to the King's cau&s;e, and
cautious not to make conce&s;&s;ions which might be pre|judicial
to their party<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 245.</NOTE> Su&s;&s;ex al&s;o, in his letters,
dropped hints to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and Elizabeth her|&s;elf
&s;aid to the abbot of Dunfermling, whom Lenox
had &s;ent to the court of England, that &s;he would not
in&s;i&s;t on Mary's re&s;toration, provided the Scots could
make the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e appear to her &s;atisfaction;
and that even, if their rea&s;ons &s;hould fall &s;hort of full
conviction, &s;he would take effectual care to provide for
their future &s;ecurity<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 247, 248.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Scots Parliament appointed the Earl of Morton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1571. 1&s;t of March$</NOTE>
the Abbot of Dunfermling, and Sir James Macgill to
manage the treaty. The&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners fir&s;t pre&s;ent|ed
memorials, containing rea&s;ons for the depo&s;ition of
their Queen; and they &s;econded their arguments, with
examples drawn from the Scots hi&s;tory, with the autho|rity
of laws, and with the &s;entiments of many famous
divines. The lofty ideas, which Elizabeth had enter|tained
of the ab&s;olute, indefeizable right of &s;overeigns,
made her be &s;hocked with the&s;e republican topics; and
&s;he told the Scots commi&s;&s;ioners, that &s;he was no-wi&s;e
&s;atisfied with their rea&s;ons for ju&s;tifying the conduct of
their countrymen; and that they might therefore pro|ceed
to open the conditions, which they required for
their &s;ecurity<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 248, 249.</NOTE>. They replied, that their commi&s;&s;ion
did not empower them to treat of any terms, which
<PB N="178" REF="195">
might infringe the title and &s;overeignty of their young
king; but they would gladly hear whatever propo&s;als
&s;hould be made them by her maje&s;ty. The conditi|ons,
recommended by the Queen, were not di&s;advan|tageous
to Mary; but as the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;till in&s;i&s;ted
that they were not authorized to treat, in any manner,
concerning the re&s;toration of that Prince&s;s<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Haynes, 623.</NOTE>, the con|ferences
were nece&s;&s;arily at an end; and Elizabeth di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
the Scots commi&s;&s;ioners with injunctions, that
they &s;hould return, after having procured more ample
powers from their Parliament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 249, 250, &amp;c. Le&s;ly, p. 133, 136 Camden, p. 431, 432.</NOTE>. The bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s
complained openly to the Engli&s;h council, that they had
abu&s;ed his mi&s;tre&s;s by fair promi&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions; and
Mary her&s;elf was no longer at a lo&s;s to judge of Eliza|beth's
in&s;incerity. By rea&s;on of the&s;e di&s;appointments,
matters came &s;till nearer to extremity between the two
Prince&s;&s;es; and the Queen of Scots, finding all her hopes
eluded, was more &s;trongly incited to make, at all ha|zards,
every po&s;&s;ible attempt for her liberty and &s;ecuri|ty.</P>
<P>AN
incident al&s;o happened about this time, which tended
to widen the breach between Mary and Elizabeth, and
to encrea&s;e the vigilance and jealou&s;y of the latter Prin|ce&s;s.
Pope Pius the fifth, who had &s;ucceeded Paul, after
having endeavoured in vain to conciliate by gentle means
the friend&s;hip of Elizabeth, whom his predece&s;&s;or's vio|lence
had irritated, i&s;&s;ued at la&s;t a bull of excommuni|cation
again&s;t her, deprived her of all title to the crown,
and ab&s;olved her &s;ubjects from their oaths of allegiance<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 427.</NOTE>.
It &s;eems probable, that this attack on the Queen's au|thority
was made in concert with Mary, who intended
by that means to forward the northern rebellion; a mea|&s;ure
which was at that time projected<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 441, from Cajetanus' life of Pius the &s;ith.</NOTE>. John Felton
affixed this bull to the gates of the bi&s;hop of London's
<PB N="179" REF="196">
palace; and &s;corning either to fly or deny the fact, he
was &s;eized, and condemned, and received the crown of
martyrdom, for which he appears to have entertained &s;o
violent an ambition<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 428.</NOTE></P>
<P>A new Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of April. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> after five years interval, was a&s;|&s;embled
at We&s;tmin&s;ter; and as the Queen, by the rage
of the pope again&s;t her, was become &s;till more the head
of the ruling party, it might be expected, both from this
incident and from her own prudent and vigorous con|duct,
that her authority over the two hou&s;es would be
ab&s;olutely uncontroulable. It was &s;o in fact; yet it is
remarkable, that it prevailed not without &s;ome &s;mall
oppo&s;ition; and that too ari&s;ing chiefly from the height
of zeal for prote&s;tanti&s;m; a di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h,
which, in general, contributed extremely to encrea&s;e
the Queen's popularity. We &s;hall be &s;omewhat parti|cular
in relating the tran&s;actions of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e
they &s;how, as well the extent of the royal power during
that age, as the di&s;po&s;ition of Elizabeth and the genius
of her government. It will be curious al&s;o to ob&s;erve
the faint dawnings of the &s;pirit of liberty in the Engli&s;h,
the jealou&s;y with which that &s;pirit was repre&s;&s;ed by the
&s;overeign, the imperious conduct which was maintained
in oppo&s;ition to it, and the ea&s;e with which it was &s;ub|dued
by this arbitrary Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Lord keeper, Bacon, after the &s;peaker of the
commons was elected, told the Parliament, in the
Queen's name, that &s;he enjoined them not to meddle
with any matters of &s;tate<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 141.</NOTE>: Such was his expre&s;&s;ion;
by which he probably meant, the que&s;tions of the
Queen's marriage and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, about which they
had before given her &s;ome trouble: For as to the other
great points of government, alliances, peace and war,
or foreign negotiations; no Parliament in that age ever
ventured to take them under con&s;ideration, or que|&s;tion,
in the&s;e particulars, the conduct of their &s;ove|reign.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="197">
IN the former Parliament, the puritans had intro|duced
&s;even bills for a farther reformation in religion;
but they had not been able to prevail in any one of
them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 18</NOTE>. This hou&s;e of commons had &s;at a very few
days, when Stricland, a member, revived one of the
bills, that for the amendment of the liturgy<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 156, 157.</NOTE>. The
chief objection, which he mentioned, was the &s;ign of
the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m. Another member added, the
kneeling at the &s;acrament; and remarked, that if a
po&s;ture of humiliation was requi&s;ite in that act of
devotion, it were better that the communicants
&s;hould throw them&s;elves pro&s;trate on the ground, in
order to keep at the wide&s;t di&s;tance from former fu|per&s;tition<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>RELIGION was a point, of which Elizabeth was,
if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more jealous than of matters of &s;tate.
She pretended, that, in quality of &s;upreme head or go|vernor
of the church, &s;he was fully empowered, by her
prerogative alone, to decide all que&s;tions which might
ari&s;e with regard to doctrine, di&s;cipline, or wor&s;hip;
and &s;he never would allow her Parliaments &s;o much as
to take the&s;e points into con&s;ideration<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 158.</NOTE> The courtiers
forgot not to in&s;i&s;t on this topic: The trea&s;urer of the
hou&s;hold, tho' he allowed, that any here&s;y might be
condemned by Parliament, (a conce&s;&s;ion which &s;eems
to have been very ra&s;h and unguarded; &s;ince the act,
inve&s;ting the crown with the &s;upremacy, or rather re|cognizing
that prerogative, gave the &s;overeign full power
to reform all here&s;ies) yet he affirmed, that it belonged
to the Queen alone, as head of the church, to regulate
every que&s;tion of ceremony in wor&s;hip<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 166.</NOTE> The comp|troller
&s;econded this argument; in&s;i&s;ted on the extent
of the Queen's prerogative; and &s;aid, that the hou&s;e
might, from former examples, have taken warning not
to meddle with &s;uch matters. One Pi&s;tor oppo&s;ed the&s;e
remon&s;trance of the courtiers. He was &s;candalized,
<PB N="181" REF="198">
he &s;aid, that affairs of &s;uch infinite con&s;equence (viz.
kneeling and making the &s;ign of the cro&s;s) &s;hould be
pa&s;&s;ed over &s;o lightly. The&s;e que&s;tions, he added, con|cern
the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls, and intere&s;t every one
of us more deeply than the monarchy of the whole
world. This cau&s;e he &s;hewed to be God's; the re&s;t
were all but terrene, yea trifles in compari&s;on, call
you them ever &s;o great: Sub&s;idies, crowns, kingdoms,
he knew not what weight they had, when laid in the
ballance with &s;ubjects of &s;uch un&s;peakable importance<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 166.</NOTE>
Tho' the zeal of this member &s;eems to have been highly
approved of, the hou&s;e, overawed by the prerogative,
voted upon the que&s;tion, that a petition &s;hould be pre|&s;ented
to her maje&s;ty, for her licence to proceed farther
in this bill; and in the mean time to &s;top all debate or
rea&s;oning concerning it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 167.</NOTE></P>
<P>MATTERS would probably have re&s;ted here, had not
the Queen been &s;o highly offended with Stricland's pre|&s;umption,
in moving the bill for $$formation of the
liturgy, that &s;he &s;ent for him to the council, and pro|hibited
him thenceforth to appear in the hou&s;e of com|mons<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>. That act of power was too violent even for
this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Parliament to endure. Carleton took
notice of the matter, complained that the liberties of
the hou&s;e were violated; ob&s;erved that Stricland was
not a private man, but repre&s;ented a multitude; and
moved, that he might be &s;ent for, and, if he was guilty
of any offence, might an&s;wer for it at the bar of the
hou&s;e, which he in&s;inuated to be the only competent
tribunal<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Yelverton enforced the principles of liberty
with &s;till greater boldne&s;s. He &s;aid, that the precedent
was dangerous: And tho' in this happy time of lenity,
among &s;o many good and honourable per&s;onages as
were at pre&s;ent inve&s;ted with authority, nothing of
extremity or injury was to be apprehended; yet the
times might alter; what now is permitted, hereafter
might be con&s;trued as duty, and might be enforced even
<PB N="182" REF="199">
on the ground of the pre&s;ent permi&s;&s;ion. He added,
that all matters not trea&s;onable, or which implied <HI>too
much</HI> derogation of the imperial crown, might, without
offence, be introduced into Parliament, where every
que&s;tion that concerned the community mu&s;t be con|&s;idered,
and where even the right of the crown it&s;elf
mu&s;t finally be determined. He remarked, that men
&s;at not in that hou&s;e in their private capacities, but as
elected by their country; and tho' it was proper, that
the prince &s;hould retain his prerogative, yet was that
prerogative limited by law: As the &s;overeign could not
of him&s;elf make laws, neither could he break them,
merely from his own authority<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 175, 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE principles were popular, and noble, and ge|nerous;
but the open a&s;&s;ertion of them was, at that
time, &s;omewhat new in England: And the courtiers
were more warranted by pre&s;ent practice, when they
advanced a contrary doctrine. The trea&s;urer warned
the hou&s;e to be cautious in their proceedings; neither
to venture farther than their a&s;&s;ured warrant might ex|tend,
nor hazard their good opinion with her maje&s;ty in
any doubtful cau&s;e. The member, he &s;aid, whom
they required, was not detained on account of any
liberty of &s;peech, but for the exhibiting a bill in the
hou&s;e again&s;t the prerogative of the Queen; a temerity
which was not to be tolerated. And he concluded with
ob&s;erving, that even &s;peeches made in that hou&s;e, have
been que&s;tioned and examined by the &s;overeign<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>.
Cleere, another member, remarked, that the &s;overeign's
prerogative is not &s;o much as di&s;putable, and that the
&s;afety of the Queen is the &s;afety of the &s;ubjects. He
added, that, in que&s;tions of divinity, every man was
for his in&s;truction to repair to his ordinary; and he
&s;eems to in&s;inuate, that the bi&s;hops them&s;elves, for their
in&s;truction, mu&s;t repair to the Queen<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Mr. Fleet|wood
ob&s;erved, that, in his memory, he knew a man,
<PB N="183" REF="200">
who, in the fifth of the pre&s;ent Queen, had been called
to account for a &s;peech in the hou&s;e. But le&s;t this
example &s;hould be too recent, he would inform them,
from the parliament rolls, that in the reign of Henry
the fifth, a bi&s;hop was committed to pri&s;on by the
King's command, on account of his freedom of &s;peech;
and the Parliament pre&s;umed not to go farther than to
be humble &s;uitors for him: In the &s;ub&s;equent reign the
&s;peaker him&s;elf was committed, with another member;
and the hou&s;e found no other remedy than a like &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive
application. He advi&s;ed the hou&s;e to have re|cour&s;e
to the &s;ame expedient; and not to pre&s;ume,
either to &s;end for their member, or demand him as of
right<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 176.</NOTE>. During this &s;peech, tho&s;e members of the
council who &s;at in the hou&s;e, whi&s;pered together;
upon which the &s;peaker moved, that the hou&s;e &s;hould
make &s;tay of all farther proceedings: A motion, which
was immediately complied with. The Queen finding
that the experiment which &s;he had made, was likely to
exite a great commotion, &s;aved her honour by this
&s;ilence of the hou&s;e; and that the que&s;tion might
no more be re&s;umed, &s;he &s;ent next day to Stricland
her permi&s;&s;ion to give his attendance in Parlia|ment<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this rebuke from the throne, the
zeal of the commons &s;till engaged them to continue the
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e other bills which regarded religion;
but they were interrupted by a &s;till more arbitrary pro|ceeding
of the Queen, in which the lords conde&s;cended
to be her in&s;trument. That hou&s;e &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to
the commons, de&s;iring that a committee might attend
them. Some members were accordingly appointed for
that purpo&s;e; and the upper hou&s;e informed them,
that the Queen's maje&s;ty being informed of the ar|ticles
of reformation which they had canva&s;&s;ed, approv|ed
of them, intended to publi&s;h them, and to make the
<PB N="184" REF="201">
bi&s;hops execute them, by virtue of her regal authority,
as &s;upreme head of the church of England: But that
&s;he would not permit them to be treated of in Parlia|ment<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 180, 185.</NOTE>.
The hou&s;e, tho' they did not entirely &s;top
proceedings on account of this injunction, &s;eem to
have been no-wi&s;e offended at &s;uch haughty treat|ment;
and in the i&s;&s;ue all their bills came to no|thing.</P>
<P>A
MOTION, made by Robert Bell, a puritan, again&s;t
an exclu&s;ive patent granted to a company of merchants
at Bri&s;tol<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 159.</NOTE>, gave al&s;o occa&s;ion to &s;ome remarkable
incidents. The Queen, &s;ome days after the motion
was made, &s;ent her orders, by the mouth of the &s;peak|er,
commanding the hou&s;e to &s;pend little time in
motions, and to avoid long &s;peeches. All the members
under&s;tood that &s;he had been offended, becau&s;e a matter
had been moved which &s;eemed to touch her preroga|tive<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 159.</NOTE>.
Fleetwood accordingly &s;poke of this delicate
&s;ubject. He ob&s;erved, that the Queen had a prerogative
of granting patents; that to que&s;tion the validity of any
patent, was to invade the royal prerogative; that all
foreign trade was entirely &s;ubjected to the plea&s;ure of
the &s;overeign; that even the &s;tatute which gave liberty
of commerce, admitted of all prohibitions from the
crown; and that the prince, when he granted an ex|clu&s;ive
patent, only employed the power ve&s;ted in him,
and prohibited all others from dealing in any particular
branch of commerce. He quoted the Clerk of the
Parliament's book, to prove, that no man might &s;peak
in Parliament of the &s;tatute of wills, unle&s;s the King
fir&s;t gave licence; becau&s;e the royal prerogative in
the wards was thereby touched. He &s;hewed likewi&s;e
the &s;tatutes of Edward the fir&s;t, Edward the third, and
Henry the fourth, with a &s;aving of the prerogative.
And in Edward the &s;ixth's time, the protector was
<PB N="185" REF="202">
applied to, for his allowance to mention matters of pre|rogative<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR Humphrey Gilbert, the gallant &s;ea-adventurer,
carried the&s;e topics &s;till farther. He endeavoured to
prove the motion made by Bell to be a vain device,
and perilous to be treated of; &s;ince it tended to the
derogation of the prerogative imperial, which whoever
&s;hould attempt &s;o much as in fancy, could not, he &s;aid,
be otherwi&s;e accounted than an open enemy. For what
difference is there between &s;aying, that the Queen is
not to u&s;e the privilege of the crown, and &s;aying that
&s;he is not Queen? And tho' experience has &s;hewn &s;o
much clemency in her maje&s;ty, as might, perhaps,
make the &s;ubjects forget their duty; it is not good to
&s;port or venture too much with princes. He remem|bered
them of the fable of the hare, who, upon the
proclamation, that all horned bea&s;ts &s;hould depart the
court, immediately fled, le&s;t his ears &s;hould be con&s;tru|ed
to be horns; and by this apologue he &s;eems to in|&s;inuate,
that even tho&s;e who heard or permitted &s;uch
dangerous &s;peeches, would not them&s;elves be entirely
free from danger. He de&s;ired them to beware, le&s;t,
if they meddled farther with the&s;e matters, the Queen
might look to her own power, and finding her&s;elf able to
&s;uppre&s;s their challenged liberty, and to exert an arbi|trary
authority, might imitate the example of Lewis
the eleventh of France, who, as he termed it, delivered
the crown from ward&s;hip.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 168.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' this &s;peech gave &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, no body, at
the time, replied any thing, but that Sir Humphrey
mi&s;took the meaning of the hou&s;e, and of the member
who made the motion: They never had other purpo&s;e,
than to repre&s;ent their grievances in due and &s;eemly
form unto her maje&s;ty. But, in a &s;ub&s;equent debate,
Peter Wentworth, a man of a &s;uperior free &s;pirit, called
that &s;peech an in&s;ult on the hou&s;e; noted Sir Hum|phrey's
<PB N="186" REF="203">
di&s;po&s;ition to flatter and fawn on the prince;
compared him to the cameleon, which can change it &s;elf
into all colours, except white; and recommended to
the hou&s;e, a due care of liberty of &s;peech, and of the
privileges of Parliament<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 175.</NOTE>. It appears, on the whole,
that the motion again&s;t the exclu&s;ive patent had no
effect. Bell, the member who fir&s;t introduced it, was
&s;ent for by the council, and was &s;everely reprimanded
for his temerity. He returned to the hou&s;e with &s;uch an
amazed countenance, that all the members, well in|formed
of the rea&s;on, were &s;truck with terror; and
during &s;ome time, no one dur&s;t ri&s;e to &s;peak of any
matter of importance, for fear of giving offence to the
Queen and the council. Even after the fears of the
commons were &s;omewhat abated, the members &s;poke
with extreme precaution; and by employing mo&s;t of
their di&s;cour&s;e in preambles and apologies, they &s;hewed
their con&s;cious terror of the rod which was hanging
over them. Wherever any delicate point was touched
tho' ever &s;o gently; nay &s;eemed to be approached, tho'
at ever &s;o great a di&s;tance, the whi&s;per ran about the
hou&s;e, &startq;The Queen will be offended; the council
will be extremely di&s;plea&s;ed:&endq; And by the&s;e &s;ur|mizes
men were warned of the danger to which they
expo&s;ed them&s;elves. It is remarkable, that the patent
which the Queen defended with &s;uch imperious vio|lence,
was contrived for the profit of four courtiers,
and was attended with the utter ruin of &s;even or eight
thou&s;and of her indu&s;trious &s;ubjects<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 242.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS every thing which pa&s;&s;ed the two hou&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> was
extremely re&s;pectful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive; yet did the Queen
think it incumbent on her, at the conclu&s;ion of the &s;e&s;&s;i|on,
to check, and that with great &s;everity, tho&s;e feeble
efforts for liberty, which had appeared in the motions
and &s;peeches of &s;ome members. The lord keeper told
the commons, in her maje&s;ty's name, that, tho' the ma|jority
of the lower hou&s;e had &s;hewed them&s;elves, in
<PB N="187" REF="204">
their proceedings, di&s;creet and dutiful, yet a few of
them had di&s;covered a contrary character, and had ju&s;t|ly
merited the reproach of audacious, arrogant, and pre|&s;umptuous:
Contrary to their duty, both as &s;ubjects
and parliament-men, nay contrary to the expre&s;s in|junctions
given them from the throne at the beginning
of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; injunctions, which it might well have be|come
them to have better attended to; they had pre&s;um|ed
to call in que&s;tion her maje&s;ty's grants and preroga|tives.
But her maje&s;ty warns them, that &s;ince they
will thus wilfully forget them&s;elves, they are otherwi&s;e
to be admoni&s;hed: Some other &s;pecies of correction mu&s;t
be found for them; &s;ince neither the commands of her
maje&s;ty, nor the example of their wi&s;er brethren, can
reclaim their audacious, arrogant, and pre&s;umptuous
folly, by which they are thus led to meddle with what
no way belongs to them, and what lies not within the
compa&s;s of their under&s;tanding<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e tran&s;actions appears clearly the opinion
which Elizabeth had entertained of the duty and autho|rity
of Parliaments. They were not to canva&s;s any
matters of &s;tate: Still le&s;s were they to meddle with
the church. Que&s;tions of either kind were far above
their reach, and were appropriated to the prince alone,
or to tho&s;e councils and mini&s;ters with whom he was
plea&s;ed to entru&s;t them. What then was the office of
Parliaments? They might give directions for the due
tanning of leather, or milling of cloth; for the pre&s;er|vation
of phea&s;ants and partridges; for the reparation of
bridges and highways; for the puni&s;hment of vagabonds
or common beggars. Regulations concerning the po|lice
of the country came properly under their in&s;pec|tion;
and the laws of this kind which they pre&s;cribed,
had, if not a greater, yet a more durable authority, than
tho&s;e derived &s;olely from the proclamations of the &s;ove|reign.
Precedents or reports could &s;ix a rule for deci|&s;ions
<PB N="188" REF="205">
in private property, or the puni&s;hment of crimes;
but no alteration or innovation in the municipal law
could proceed from any other &s;ource than the Parlia|ment;
nor would the courts of ju&s;tice be induced to
change their e&s;tabli&s;hed practice by an order of council.
But the mo&s;t acceptable part of parliamentary tran&s;ac|tions
was the granting of &s;ub&s;idies; the attainting and
puni&s;hing the obnoxious nobility, or any mini&s;ter of
&s;tate after his fall; the countenancing &s;uch great efforts
of power, as might be deemed &s;omewhat exceptionable,
when they proceeded entirely from the &s;overeign. The
redre&s;s of grievances was &s;ometimes promi&s;ed to the
people; but &s;eldom could have place, while it was an
e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, that the prerogatives of the crown mu&s;t
not be abridged, or &s;o much as que&s;tioned and exa|mined
in Parliament. Even tho' monopolies and exclu|&s;ive
companies had already reached an enormous height,
and were every day encrea&s;ing, to the de&s;truction of all
liberty, and extinction of all indu&s;try; it was criminal
in a member to propo&s;e, in the mo&s;t dutiful and regular
manner, a parliamentary application again&s;t any of
them.</P>
<P>THESE maxims of government were not kept &s;ecret
by Elizabeth, or &s;moothed over by any fair appearances
or plau&s;ible pretences. They were openly avowed in
her &s;peeches and me&s;&s;ages to Parliament; and were ac|companied
with all the haughtine&s;s, nay &s;ometimes bit|terne&s;s
of expre&s;&s;ion, which the meane&s;t &s;ervant could
look for from his offended ma&s;ter. Yet notwith&s;tand|ing
this conduct, Elizabeth continued to be the mo&s;t po|pular
&s;overeign that ever &s;wayed the &s;cepter of England;
becau&s;e the maxims of her reign were conformable to
the principles of the times, and to the opinion which
was generally entertained with regard to the con&s;titution.
The continued encroachments of popular a&s;&s;emblies on
Elizabeth's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have &s;o changed our ideas of the&s;e
matters, that the pa&s;&s;ages above mentioned appear to
<PB N="189" REF="206">
us extremely curious, and even at fir&s;t &s;urprizing; but
they were &s;o little remarked, during the time, that
neither Camden, tho' a contemporary writer, nor any
other hi&s;torian, has taken any notice of them. So ab|&s;olute
was the authority of the crown, that the preci|ous
&s;park of liberty had been kindled, and was pre|&s;erved,
by the puritans alone; and it was to this &s;ect,
who&s;e principles appear &s;o frivolous and habits &s;o ridi|culous,
that the Engli&s;h owe the whole freedom of their
con&s;titution. Actuated by that zeal which belongs to
innovators, and by the courage which enthu&s;ia&s;m in|&s;pires,
they hazarded the utmo&s;t indignation of their
&s;overeign; and employing all their indu&s;try to be elec|ted
into Parliament; a matter not difficult, while a &s;eat
was rather regarded as a burthen than an advantage<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">It appeared this &s;e&s;&s;ion, that a bribe of four pounds had been given to a mayor for a &s;eat in Parliament. D'Ewes, p. 181. It is probable, that the member had no other view but the privilege of being free from arre&s;ts.</NOTE>;
they fir&s;t acquired a majority in that a&s;&s;embly, and then
obtained an a&s;cendant over the church and monarchy.</P>
<P>THE following were the principal laws enacted this
&s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament. It was declared Erea&s;on, during
the life-time of the Queen, to affirm, that &s;he was not
the lawful &s;overeign, or that any other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a bet|ter
title, or that &s;he was a heretic, &s;chi&s;matic, or in&s;idel,
or that the laws and &s;tatutes cannot limit and determine
the right of the crown and the &s;ucce&s;&s;or thereof: To
maintain in writing or printing, that any per&s;on, ex|cept
the <HI>natural i&s;&s;ue</HI> of her body, is or ought to be the
Queen's heir or &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;ubjected the per&s;on and all
his abettors, for the fir&s;t offence, to impri&s;onment dur|ing
a year, and to the forfeiture of half their goods: The
&s;econd offence &s;ubjected them to the penalty of a premu|nire<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">13 Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE>.
This law was plainly leveled again&s;t the Queen
of Scots and her partizans; and implyed an avowal,
that Elizabeth never intended to declare her &s;ucce&s;&s;or. It
may be noted, that the u&s;ual phra&s;e of <HI>lawful i&s;&s;ue,</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="207">
which the Parliament thought indecent towards the
Queen, as if &s;he could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any other,
was changed into that of <HI>natural i&s;&s;ue.</HI> But this altera|tion
was the &s;ource of great ridicule during the time;
and &s;ome per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected a deeper de&s;ign, as if Lei|ce&s;ter
intended, in ca&s;e of the Queen's death, to produce
&s;ome ba&s;tard of his own, and affirm that he was her
offspring<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 436.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was al&s;o enacted, that who&s;oever $word$ bulls &s;hall
publi&s;h ab&s;olutions or other re&s;cripts of the pope, or
&s;hall by means of them reconcile any man to the church
of Rome, &s;uch offenders, as well as tho&s;e who were &s;o
reconciled, &s;hould be guilty of trea&s;on. The penalty
of a premunire was impo&s;ed on every one who imported
any <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI> crucifix, or &s;uch other implement of &s;u|per&s;tition,
con&s;ecrated by the pope<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">13 Eliz. c. 2.</NOTE>. The former laws
again&s;t taking intere&s;t, which was denominated u&s;ury,
were enforced by a new &s;tatute<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 8.</NOTE>. A &s;upply of one &s;ub|&s;idy
and two fifteenths was granted by Parliament.
The Queen; as &s;he was determined to yield to them
none of her power, was very cautious of a&s;king them
for any &s;upplies. She endeavoured, either by a rigid
frugality to make her ordinary revehues &s;uffice for the
nece&s;&s;ities of the crown, or &s;he employed her preroga|tive
and acquired money by the granting of patents,
monopolies, or by &s;ome &s;uch ruinous expedient.</P>
<P>THO' Elizabeth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch uncontrouled autho|rity
over her parliaments, and &s;uch exten&s;ive influence
over her people; tho' during a cour&s;e of thirteen years,
&s;he had been able to maintain the public tranquillity,
which was only interrupted by the ha&s;ty and ill-con|certed
in&s;urrection of the north; &s;he was &s;till kept in
great anxiety, and felt her throne perpetually totter un|der
her. The violent commotions, excited in France
and the Low Countries, as well as in Scotland, &s;eemed
in one view to &s;ecure her again&s;t any di&s;turbance; but
<PB N="191" REF="208">
they &s;erved, on more reflection, to in&s;truct her in the
danger of her &s;ituation, when &s;he remarked, that Eng|land,
no le&s;s than the&s;e neighbouring countries, contain|ed
the &s;eeds of inte&s;tine di&s;cord, the differences of re|ligious
opinion, and the furious intolerance and ani|mo&s;ity
of the oppo&s;ite &s;ectaries.</P>
<P>THE league,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of France.</NOTE> at Bayonne in 1566 for the ex|termination
of the prote&s;tants, had not been concluded
&s;o &s;ecretly but intelligence of it had reached Cond&eacute;, Co|ligni,
and the other leaders of the hugonots; and find|ing,
that the mea&s;ures of the court agreed with their
&s;u&s;picions, they determined to prevent the cruel perfidy
of their enemies, and to &s;trike a blow before the catho|lics
were aware of the danger. The hugonots, tho'
di&s;per&s;ed over the whole kingdom, formed a kind of
&s;eparate empire; and being clo&s;ely united, as well by
their religious zeal, as by the dangers, to which they
were perpetually expo&s;ed, they obeyed with entire &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
the orders of their leaders, and were ready on
every alarm to fly to arms. The King and Queen
mother were living in great &s;ecurity at Monceaux in
Brie; when they found them&s;elves &s;urrounded by pro|te&s;tant
troops, which had &s;ecretly marched thither from
all quarters; and had not a body of Swi&s;s come ha&s;tily
to their relief, and conducted them with great intrepi|dity
to Paris, they mu&s;t have fallen, without re&s;i&s;tance,
into the hands of the malecontents. A battle was af|terwards
fought in the plains of St. Dennis, where,
tho' the old con&s;table Montmorency, the general of the
catholics, was killed combating bravely at the head of
his troops, the hugonots were finally defeated. Cond&eacute;
collecting his broken troops, and receiving a &s;trong re|inforcement
from the German prote&s;tants, appeared
again in the field; and laying &s;iege to Chartres, a place
of great importance, obliged the court to agree to a
new accommodation. Such was the mutual animo&s;ity
of the&s;e religioni&s;ts, that, even had the leaders on both
$ides been ever &s;o &s;incere in their intentions for peace,

and repo&s;ed ever &s;o great confidence in each other, it
would have been difficult to have retained the people in
tranquillity; much more, where &s;uch extreme jealou&s;y
prevailed, and where the court employed every pacifica|tion
as a &s;nare for their enemies. A plan was laid for
feizing the per&s;on of the prince and admiral; who nar|rowly
e&s;caped to Rochelle, and &s;ummoned their parti|zans
to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. 4.</NOTE>. The civil wars were renew|ed
with greater fury than ever, and the parties became
&s;till more exa&s;perated again&s;t each other. The young
duke of Anjou, brother to the King, commanded the
forces of the catholics; and fought in 1569 a great bat|tle
at Jarnac with the hugonots, where the prince of
Cond&eacute; was killed, and his army defeated. This di&s;com|fiture,
with the lo&s;s of &s;o great a leader, reduced not the
hugonots to de&s;pair. The admiral &s;till &s;upported the
cau&s;e; and having placed at the head of the prote&s;tants,
the prince of Navarre, then &s;ixteen years of age, and
the young prince of Cond&eacute;, he encouraged the party
rather to peri&s;h bravely in the field, than ignominiou&s;ly
by the hands of the executioner. He collected &s;uch
numbers, &s;o determined to endure every extremity,
that he was enabled to make head again&s;t the duke of
Anjou; and being &s;trengthened by a new reinforce|ment
of Germans, he obliged that prince to retreat and
to divide his forces. Coligni then laid &s;iege to Poi|tiers;
and as the eyes of all France were turned on this
enterprize, the duke of Gui&s;e, emulous of the renown,
which his father had acquired by the defence of Mentz,
threw him&s;elf into the place, and &s;o animated the garri|&s;on
by his valour and conduct, that the admiral was
obliged to rai&s;e the fiege. Such was the commence|ment
of that unrivaled &s;ame and grandeur, afterwards
attained by this duke of Gui&s;e. The attachment, which
all the catholics had borne to his father, was immedi|ately
transferred to the &s;on; and men plea&s;ed them&s;elves
<PB N="193" REF="212">
in comparing all the great and heroic qualities, which
&s;eemed, in a manner, hereditary in that family. Equal
in affability, in munificence, in addre&s;s, in eloquence,
and in every quality, which engages the affections of
men; equal al&s;o in valour, in conduct, in enterprize,
in capacity; there &s;eemed only this difference between
them, that the &s;on, educated in more turbulent times,
and finding a greater di&s;&s;olution of all law and order,
exceeded the father in ambition and temerity, and was
engaged in enterprizes &s;till more de&s;tructive to the au|thority
of his &s;overeign and to the repo&s;e of his native
country.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who kept her attention fixed on the
civil commotions of France, was no wi&s;e plea&s;ed with
this new ri&s;e of her enemies, the Gui&s;es; and being
anxious for the fate of the prote&s;tants, who&s;e intere&s;ts
were connected with her own<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 471.</NOTE>, &s;he was engaged, not|with&s;tanding
her aver&s;ion again&s;t all rebellion, and all
oppo&s;ition to the will of the &s;overeign, to give them &s;e|cretly
&s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Be&s;ides employing her authori|ty
with the German princes, &s;he &s;ent money to the
Queen of Navarre, and received &s;ome jewels as pledges
for the loan. And &s;he permitted Henry Champernon
to levy, and tran&s;port over into France, a regiment of
an hundred gentlemen voluntiers; among whom Wal|ter
Raleigh, then a young man, began to di&s;tingui&s;h
him&s;elf in that great &s;chool of military valour<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 423.</NOTE>. The
admiral, con&s;trained by the impatience of his troops,
and by the difficulty of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them, fought with the
duke of Aujou, the battle of Moncontour in Poictou,
where he was wounded and defeated. The court of
France, notwith&s;tanding their frequent experience of
the ob&s;tinacy of the hugonots, and the vigour of Co|ligni,
vainly flattered them&s;elves that the force of the
rebels was at la&s;t finally annihilated; and they neglec|ted
farther preparations again&s;t a foe, who, they thought,
<PB N="194" REF="213">
could never more become dangerous. They were &s;ur|prized
to hear, that that leader had appeared in another
quarter of the kingdom; had encouraged the young
princes, whom he governed, to equal con&s;tancy; had
a&s;&s;embled an army; had taken the field; and was even
&s;trong enough to threaten Paris. The public finances,
dimini&s;hed by the continued di&s;orders of the kingdom,
and wa&s;ted by &s;o many fruitle&s;s military enterprizes,
could no longer bear the charge of a new armament;
and the King, notwith&s;tanding his extreme animo&s;ity
again&s;t the hugonots, was obliged, in 1570, to conclude
an accommodation with them, to grant them a pardon
for all pa&s;t offences, and to renew the edicts for liberty
of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>THO' a pacification was feemingly concluded, the
mind of Charles was no wi&s;e reconciled to his rebellious
&s;ubjects; and this accommodation, like all the forego|ing,
was nothing but a &s;nare, by which the perfidious
court had projected to de&s;troy at once, without danger,
all its formidable enemies. As the two young princes,
the admiral, and all the leaders of the hugonots, in&s;tru|cted
by pa&s;t experience, di&s;covered an extreme di&s;tru&s;t
of the King's intentions, and kept them&s;elves in &s;ecu|rity,
at a di&s;tance, all po&s;&s;ible artifices were employed
to remove their apprehen&s;ions, and convince them of the
&s;incerity of the new coun&s;els, which &s;eemed to be
embraced. The terms of the peace were &s;trictly ob|&s;erved
to them; the toleration was regularly maintain|ed;
all attempts, made by the zealous catholics to in|fringe
it, were puni&s;hed with &s;everity; offices, and
favours, and honours were be&s;towed on the principal
nobility among the prote&s;tants; and the King and
council every where declared, that, tired of civil di&s;or|ders,
and convinced of the impo&s;&s;ibility of forcing men's
con&s;ciences, they were thenceforth determined to allow
every one the free exerci&s;e of his religion.</P>
<P>AMONG the other artifices, employed to lull the pro|te&s;tants
into a fatal &s;ecurity, Charles affected to enter
<PB N="195" REF="214">
into clo&s;e connexions with Elizabeth; and as it &s;eemed
not the intere&s;t of France to forward the union of the
two kingdoms of Great Britain, that prince&s;s the more
ea&s;ily flattered her&s;elf, that the French monarch would
prefer her friend&s;hip to that of the Queen of Scots.
The better to deceive her, propo&s;als of marriage were
made her with the duke of Anjou; a prince who&s;e
youth, beauty, and reputation for valour might natu|rally
be &s;uppo&s;ed to recommend him to a woman, who
had appeared not altogether indifferent to the&s;e en|dowments.
The Queen immediately founded on this
offer the project of deceiving the court of France; and
being intent on the artifice of that &s;cheme, &s;he laid
her&s;elf the more open to be deceived. Negotiations
were entered into with regard to the marriage; terms
of the contract were propo&s;ed; difficulties &s;tarted and
removed; and the two courts, equally in&s;incere, tho'
not equally criminal, &s;eemed to approach every day
nearer to each other in their demands and conce&s;&s;ions.
The great ob&s;tacle &s;eemed to lie in adju&s;ting the differ|ences
of religion; becau&s;e Elizabeth, who recommend|ed
toleration to Charles, was determined not to grant
it in her own dominions, not even to her hu&s;band;
and the duke of Anjou &s;eemed unwilling to &s;ubmit,
for the &s;ake of intere&s;t, to the di&s;honour of an apo&s;ta|cy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 433. Davila, lib. 5. Digges's Compleat Amba&s;&s;ador, p. 84, 110, 111.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE artificial politics of Elizabeth never triumphed
&s;o much in any contrivances as in tho&s;e which were
conjoined with her coquetry; and as her character in
this particular was generally known, the court of
France thought that they might, without danger of
forming any final conclu&s;ion, venture the farther in their
conce&s;&s;ions and offers to her. The Queen al&s;o had
other motives for di&s;&s;imulation. Be&s;ides the advantage
of di&s;couraging Mary's partizans by the pro&s;pect of an
alliance between France and England, her &s;ituation
<PB N="196" REF="215">
with Philip demanded her utmo&s;t vigilance and at|tention;
and the pre&s;ent revolutions in the Low
Countries made her glad of fortifying her&s;elf even
with the appearance of a new confederacy.</P>
<P>THE theological controver&s;ies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the Low-Countries.</NOTE> which had long agi|tated
Europe, had, from the beginning, penetrated
into the Low Countries; and as the&s;e provinces main|tained
a very exten&s;ive commerce, they had early re|ceived
from every kingdom, with which they corre&s;|ponded,
a tincture of religious, innovation. An opi|nion
at that time prevailed, which had been zealou&s;ly
propagated by the prie&s;ts, and implicity received by
&s;overeigns, that here&s;y was clo&s;ely connected with re|bellion,
and that every great or violent alteration in
the church involved a like revolution in the &s;tate and
civil government. The forward zeal of the reformers
would &s;eldom allow them to wait the con&s;ent of the
magi&s;trate to their innovations; they became le&s;s du|tiful
when they were oppo&s;ed and per&s;ecuted; and tho'
their pretended &s;pirit of rea&s;oning and enquiry was in
reality, among the greate&s;t part of them, nothing but
a new &s;pecies of implicit faith, the prince took the
alarm; as if no in&s;titutions could be &s;ecure from the
temerity of their re&s;earches. The emperor Charles,
who propo&s;ed to augment his authority under the pre|tence
of defending the catholic faith, ea&s;ily adopted
the&s;e political principles; and notwith&s;tanding the
limited prerogative, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the Nether|lands,
he publi&s;hed the mo&s;t arbitrary, &s;evere, and
tyrannical edicts again&s;t the prote&s;tants, and he took
care that the execution of them &s;hould be no le&s;s violent
and &s;anguinary. He was neither cruel nor bigotted
in his natural di&s;po&s;ition; yet an hi&s;torian, celebrated
for moderation and caution, has computed, that, in
the &s;everal per&s;ecutions, promoted by that monarch,
no le&s;s than an hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons peri&s;hed by the
<PB N="197" REF="216">
hands of the executioner<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Grotii Annal. lib. 1. Father Paul, another great authority, computes, in a pa&s;&s;age above cited, that 50,000 per&s;ons were put to death in the Low-Countries alone.</NOTE>. But the&s;e &s;evere remedies,
&s;o far from an&s;wering the purpo&s;e intended, had rather
&s;erved to augment the numbers as well as zeal of the
reformers; and the magi&s;trates of the &s;everal towns,
&s;eeing no end of tho&s;e barbarous executions, felt
their humanity rebel again&s;t their principles, and de|clined
any farther per&s;ecution of the new doctrines.</P>
<P>WHEN Philip &s;ucceeded to his father's dominions,
the Flemings were ju&s;tly alarmed with new apprehen|&s;ions;
le&s;t their prince, ob&s;erving the lenity of the
magi&s;trates, &s;hould take the execution of the edicts
from &s;uch remi&s;s hands, and &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h the in|qui&s;ition
in the Low Countries, accompanied with all
the iniquities and barbarities which attended it in Spain.
The &s;evere and unrelenting character of the man, his
profe&s;&s;ed attachment to Spani&s;h manners, the inflexible
bigotry of his principles; all the&s;e circum&s;tances en|crea&s;ed
their terror: And when he left the Netherlands,
with a known intention never to return, the di&s;|gu&s;t
of the inhabitants was extremely augmented, and
their dread of tho&s;e tyrannical orders, which their &s;o|vereign,
&s;urrounded with Spani&s;h mini&s;ters, would i&s;&s;ue
from his cabinet of Madrid. He left the dutche&s;s of
Parma governe&s;s of the Low Countries and the natural
good &s;en&s;e and good temper of that prince&s;s, had &s;he
been entru&s;ted with the &s;ole power, would have pre|&s;erved
the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e opulent provinces,
which were lo&s;t from that refinement of treacherous
and barbarous politics, on which Philip &s;o highly
valued him&s;elf. The Flemings found, that the name
alone of regent remained with the dutche&s;s; that
cardinal Granville po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed entirely the King's con|fidence;
that attempts were every day made on
their liberties; that a re&s;olution was taken never
more to a&s;&s;emble the &s;tates; that new bi&s;hoprics were
arbitrarily erected, in order to enforce the executi|on
<PB N="198" REF="217">
of the per&s;ecuting edicts; and that on the whole,
they mu&s;t make account of being reduced to the con|dition
of a province under the Spani&s;h monarchy.
The di&s;contents of the nobility gave countenance to
the complaints of the gentry, which encouraged the
mutiny of the populace; and all orders of men &s;howed
a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to revolt. A&s;&s;ociations were form|ed,
tumultuary petitions pre&s;ented, names of di&s;tincti|on
a&s;&s;umed, badges of party di&s;played; and the current
of the people, impelled by religious zeal and irritated
by feeble re&s;i&s;tance, ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that in
&s;evetal towns, particularly in Antwerp, they made
an open inva&s;ion on the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip, pillaged
the churches and mona&s;teries, broke the images,
and committed the mo&s;t unwarrantable di&s;orders.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;er part of the nobility, particularly the prince
of Orange, and the counts Egmont and Horn, were
alarmed with the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, to which their own di&s;|contents
had at fir&s;t given countenauce; and &s;econd|ing
the wi&s;dom of the governe&s;s, they &s;uppre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e
dangerous in&s;urrections, puni&s;hed the ringleaders,
and reduced all the provinces to a &s;tate of order and
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But Philip was not contented with the
re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his antient authority: He con|&s;idered,
that provinces, &s;o remote from the &s;eat of
government, could not be ruled by a limited prerogative;
and that a prince, who mu&s;t entreat rather than com|mand,
would nece&s;&s;arily, when he re&s;ided not among
the people, feel every day a diminution of his power
and influence. He determined, therefore, to lay hold
of the late popular mutinies as a pretence for aboli&s;hing
entirely the privileges of the Low Country provinces;
and for ruling them thenceforth with a military and
arbitrary authority. In the execution of this violent
de&s;ign, he employed a man, who was a proper in|&s;trument
in the hands of &s;uch a tyrant Ferdinand of
Toledo, duke of Alva, had been educated entirely
<PB N="199" REF="218">
amid&s;t arms; and having attained a con&s;ummate know|lege
in the military art, his habits led him to transfer
into all government the &s;evere di&s;cipline of a camp,
and to conceive no mea&s;ures between prince and &s;ub|ject
but tho&s;e of rigid command and implicit obedience.
This general, in 1568, conducted from Italy to
the Low Countries a powerful body of veteran Spa|niards;
and his avowed animo&s;ity to the Flemings, with
his known character, &s;truck that whole people with
terror and con&s;ternation. It belongs not to our &s;ub|ject
to relate at length tho&s;e violences, with Alva's na|tural
barbarity, &s;teeled by reflection, and aggravat|ed
by in&s;olence exerci&s;ed on tho&s;e flouri&s;hing pro|vinces.
It &s;uffices to &s;ay, that all their privileges, the
gift of &s;o many princes, and the inheritance of &s;o
many ages, were openly and expre&s;sly aboli&s;hed by
edict; arbitrary and &s;anguinary tribunals erected; the
counts Egmont and Horn, notwith&s;tanding their great
merits and pa&s;t &s;ervices, brought to the &s;caffold; mul|titudes
of all ranks thrown into pri&s;on; and thence deli|vered
over to the executioner: And notwith&s;tanding the
peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of allmen, nothing was heard of but
confi&s;cation, impri&s;onment, exile, torture, and death.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was equally di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the progre&s;s
of that &s;cheme, laid for the extermination of the pro|te&s;tants,
and to ob&s;erve the erection of &s;o great a mili|tary
power, in a &s;tate &s;ituated &s;o near her. She gave
protection to all the Flemi&s;h exiles who took &s;helter in
her dominions; and as many of the&s;e were the mo&s;t
indu&s;trious inhabitants of the Netherlands, and had ren|dered
that country &s;o celebrated for its arts, &s;he reaped
the advantage of introducing into England &s;ome u&s;eful
manufactures, which were formerly unknown in that
kingdom. Fore&s;eeing that the violent government of
Alva could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t without exciting &s;ome com|motion,
&s;he ventured to commit an in&s;ult upon him,
which &s;he would have been cautious not to hazard
again&s;t a more e&s;tabli&s;hed authority. Some Gonoe&s;e mer|chants
<PB N="220" REF="219">
had engaged by contract with Philip, to tran&s;port
into Flanders the &s;um of four hundred thou&s;and crowns;
and the ve&s;&s;els in which this money was embarked, had
been attacked in the Channel by &s;ome privateers equip|ed
by the French Hugonots, and had taken &s;helter in
Plymouth and Southampton. The commanders of the
&s;hips pretended, that the money belonged to the King
of Spain; but the Queen finding, upon enquiry, that it
was the property of Genoe&s;e merchants, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of it as a loan; and by that means deprived the duke
of Alva of this re&s;ource in the time of his greate&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ity.
Alva, in revenge, &s;eized all the Engli&s;h mer|chants
in the Low Countries, threw them into pri|&s;on,
and confi&s;cated their effects. The Queen retalia|ted
by a like violence on the Flemi&s;h and Spani&s;h mer|chants;
and gave all the Engli&s;h liberty to make repri|zals
on the &s;ubjects of Philip. The&s;e differences were
afterwards accommodated by treaty, and mutual repara|tions
were made to the merchants: But nothing could
repair the lo&s;s which &s;o well-timed a blow inflicted on
the Spani&s;h government in the Low Countries. Alva,
in want of money, and dreading the immediate muti|ny
of his troops, to whom large arrears were due, impo|&s;ed
by his arbitrary will the mo&s;t ruinous taxes on the
people. He not only required the hundredth penny,
and the twentieth of all immoveable goods: He al&s;o de|manded
the tenth of all moveable goods on every &s;ale;
an ab&s;ured tyranny, which would not only have de&s;troy|ed
all arts and commerce, but even have re&s;trained the
common intercour&s;e of life. The people refu&s;ed com|pliance:
The duke had recour&s;e to his u&s;ual expedient
of hanging: And thus matters came &s;till nearer the la&s;t
extremity betweent the Flemings and the Spaniards<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, part I. lib. V. Camden, p. 416.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the enemies of Elizabeth, in order to revenge
them&s;elves for her in&s;ults, had naturally recour&s;e to one
policy, the &s;upporting the cau&s;e and preten&s;ions of the
<PB N="201" REF="220">
Queen of Scots;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1751.</NOTE> and Alva, who&s;e mea&s;ures were ever
violent, &s;oon opened a &s;ecret intercour&s;e with that prin|ce&s;s.
There was one Rodolphi, a Florentine mer|chant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New
con|&s;piracy of the duke of Norfolk.</NOTE> who had re&s;ided about fifteen years in London,
and who, at the &s;ame time that he conducted his com|merce
in England, had managed all the intrigues of the
court of Rome with the catholic nobility and gentry<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley. p. 123. State Trials, vol. I. p. 87.</NOTE>.
He had been thrown into pri&s;on at the time when the
duke of Norfolk's intrigues with Mary were di&s;covered;
but either no proof was found again&s;t him, or the part
which he had acted was not very criminal; and he &s;oon
after recovered his liberty. This man, zealous for pro|moting
the catholic faith, had formed a &s;cheme, in con|cert
with the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, for &s;ubverting the go|vernment,
by a foreign inva&s;ion, and a dome&s;tic in&s;ur|rection;
and when he communicated his project, by
letter, to Mary, he found, that as &s;he was now fully
convinced of Elizabeth's artifices, and de&s;paired of ever
recovering her authority, or even her liberty, by paci|fic
mea&s;ures, &s;he very willingly gave her concurrence.
The great number of di&s;contented catholics were the
chief &s;ource of their hopes on the &s;ide of England; and
they al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the kingdom was, at that time,
full of indigent gentry chiefly younger brothers, who
having at pre&s;ent, by the late decay of the church, and
the yet langui&s;hing &s;tate of commerce, no pro&s;pect of
a livelihood &s;uitable to their birth, were ready to throw
them&s;elves into any de&s;perate enterprize<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 123.</NOTE>. But in or|der
to in&s;pire &s;pirit and courage into all the&s;e malecon|tents,
it was requi&s;ite, that &s;ome great nobleman &s;hould
put him&s;elf at their head; and no one appeared to Ro|dolphi,
and to the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, who entered into all
the&s;e intrigues, &s;o proper, both on account of his pow|er
and his popularity, as the duke of Norfolk.</P>
<P>THIS nobleman, when relea&s;ed from confinement in
the Tower, had given his promi&s;e, that he would drop
<PB N="202" REF="221">
all intercour&s;e with the Queen of Scots<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 571.</NOTE>; but find|ing
that he had lo&s;t, and, as he feared, beyond all reco|very,
the confidence and favour of Elizabeth, and be|ing
&s;till, in &s;ome degree, re&s;trained from his liberty, he
was tempted, by impatience and de&s;pair, to violate his
word, and to open anew his corre&s;pondence with the
captive prince&s;s<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. $. p. 102.</NOTE>. A promi&s;e of marriage was renew|ed
between them; the duke engaged to enter into all
her intere&s;ts; and as his remor&s;es gradually decayed in
the cour&s;e of the&s;e tran&s;actions, he was pu&s;hed to give
his a&s;&s;ent to enterprizes &s;till more criminal. Rodol|phi's
plan was, that the duke of Alva &s;hould, on &s;ome
other pretence, a&s;&s;emble a great quantity of &s;hipping in
the Low countries; &s;hould tran&s;port a body of &s;ix
thou&s;and foot, and four thou&s;and hor&s;e, into England;
&s;hould land them at Harwich, where the duke of Nor|folk
was to join them with all his friends; &s;hould thence
march directly to London, and oblige the Queen to
&s;ubmit to whatever conditions the con&s;pirators &s;hould
plea&s;e to impo&s;e upon her<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 155. State Trials, vol. I. p. 86, 87.</NOTE>. Norfolk gave his con&s;ent
to this plan; and three letters in con&s;equence of it,
were wrote in his name by Rodolphi, one to Alva, ano|ther
to the pope, and a third to the King of Spain; but
the duke, apprehen&s;ive of the danger, refu&s;ed to &s;ign
them<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 159, 161. Camden, p. 432.</NOTE>. He only &s;ent to the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador a
&s;ervant and confident, named Barker, as well to noti|fy
his concurrence in the plan, as to vouch for the
authenticity of the&s;e letters; and Rodolphi, having ob|tained
a letter of credence from the amba&s;&s;ador, pro|ceeded
on his journey to Bru&s;&s;els and to Rome. The
duke of Alva and the pope embraced the &s;cheme with
alacrity: Rodolphi informed Norfolk of their intenti|ons<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 93.</NOTE>;
and every thing &s;eemed to concur in forwarding
the undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="222">
NORFOLK, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e criminal enterpri|zes,
had never entirely forgot his duty to his &s;overeign,
his country, and his religion; and tho' he had laid the
plan both for an inva&s;ion and an in&s;urrection, he &s;till
flattered him&s;elf, that the innocence of his intentions
would ju&s;tify the violence of his mea&s;ures, and that, as
he aimed at nothing but the liberty of the Queen of
Scots, and the obtaining Elizabeth's con&s;ent to his mar|riage,
he could not ju&s;tly reproach him&s;elf as a rebel
and a traitor<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Le&s;ley, p. 158.</NOTE>. It is certain, however, that, con&s;ider|ing
the Queen's vigour and &s;pirit, the &s;cheme, if &s;uc|ce&s;sful,
mu&s;t finally have ended in her dethronement;
and her authority was here expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t dan|ger.
The con&s;piracy had hitherto entirely e&s;caped the
vigilance of Elizabeth, and that of &s;ecretary Cecil, who
now bore the title of lord Burleigh. It was from ano|ther
attempt of Norfolk, that they fir&s;t obtained a hint,
which, being diligently traced, led at la&s;t to a full di&s;|covery.
Mary had intended to &s;end a &s;um of money to
lord Herreis, and her partizans in Scotland; and Nor|folk
undertook to have it conveyed to Banni&s;ter, a &s;er|vant
of his, at that time in the north, who was to find
&s;ome expedient to have it delivered to lord Herreis<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 169. State Trials, vol. I. p. 87. C$mden, p. 434. Digges, p. 134, 137, 140. Strype, vol. II. p. 82.</NOTE>. He
entru&s;ted the money to a &s;ervant, who was not in the
&s;ecret, and told him that the bag contained a &s;um of
&s;ilver, which he was to deliver to Banni&s;ter with a let|ter:
But the &s;ervant, conjecturing from the weight and
&s;ize of the bag, that it was full of gold, carried the let|ter
to Burleigh; who immediately ordered Banni&s;ter,
Barker, and Hicford, the duke's &s;ecretary, to be put
under arre&s;t, and to undergoe a &s;evere examination. The
torture made them confe&s;s the whole truth; and as
Hicford, tho' ordered to burn all papers, had carefully
kept them concealed under the mats of the duke's cham|ber,
and under the tiles of the hou&s;e, full evidence now
<PB N="204" REF="223">
appeared again&s;t his ma&s;ter<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">le&s;ley, p. 173.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1568.</NOTE> Norfolk him&s;elf, who
was entirely ignorant of the di&s;coveries made by his
&s;ervants, was brought before the council, and tho' ex|horted
to atone for his guilt by a full confe&s;&s;ion, he per|&s;i&s;ted
in denying every accu&s;ation with which he was
charged. The Queen always declared, that if he had
given her this proof of his &s;incere repentance, &s;he would
have pardoned all his former offences<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 175.</NOTE>; but finding
him ob&s;tinate, &s;he committed him to the Tower, and
ordered him to be brought to his trial. The bi&s;hop of
Ro&s;s had, on &s;ome &s;u&s;picion, been committed to cu&s;|tody
before the di&s;covery of Norfolk's guilt; and eve|ry
expedient was employed to make him reveal his &s;hare
in the&punc; con&s;piracy. He at fir&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on his privilege
as an amba&s;&s;ador; but he was told, that as his mi&s;tre&s;s
was no longer a &s;overeign, he would not be regarded
as an amba&s;&s;ador, and that even if that character was al|lowed,
it did not warrant him in con&s;piring again&s;t the
&s;overeign in who&s;e court he re&s;ided<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 189. Spotwood.</NOTE>. As he &s;till refu|&s;ed
to an&s;wer interrogatories, he was informed of the
confe&s;&s;ion made by Norfolk's &s;ervants; after which he
entertained no longer any &s;cruple to make a full di&s;co|very,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1572.</NOTE>
and his evidence put the guilt of that nobleman
beyond all que&s;tion. A jury of twenty-five peers una|nimou&s;ly

the Old Te&s;tament<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 207, 208, &amp;c.</NOTE>, which, if con&s;idered as a general

That kingdom remained &s;till in a &s;tate of anar|chy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots

Kirkaldy of Grange, had de clared for the Queen; and
the lords of that party, encouraged by his countenance,
had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital, and carried on a
vigorous war again&s;t the regent. By a &s;udden and un|expected
inroad, they &s;eized that nobleman at Stirling;
but finding that his friends, &s;allying from the ca&s;tle,
were likely to relieve him, they in&s;tantly put him to
death. The earl of Marre was cho&s;en regent in his
place; and found the &s;ame difficulties to encounter in
the government of that divided country. He was

and Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, and to conclude on equal
terms a truce with the Queen's party<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 263.</NOTE>. He was a man

who had formed clo&s;e connections with France,
yielded with le&s;s reluctance to the &s;ollicitations of that

was cho&s;en regent; and as this nobleman had &s;ecretly
taken all his mea&s;ures with Elizabeth, who no longer
relied on the frien&s;hip of the French court, &s;he re&s;olved
to exert her&s;elf more effectually for the &s;upport of that
party, whom &s;he had always favoured. She &s;ent Sir

glad to &s;ubmit to the King's authority, and accept of
an indemnity for all pa&s;t offences<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 268.</NOTE>. The duke of
Chatelrault, and the earl of Huntley, with the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable of Mary's friends, laid down their arms on
the&s;e conditions. The garri&s;on alone of the ca&s;tle of
Edinburgh continued refractory. Kirkaldy's fortunes
were de&s;perate; and he flattered him&s;elf with the hopes
of receiving a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Kings of France and
Spain, who encouraged his ob&s;tinacy, in the view of
being able, from that quarter, to give di&s;turbance
to England. Elizabeth was alarmed with the dan|ger;
&s;he no more apprehended the making an en|tire
breach with the Queen of Scots, who, &s;he found,
could not any longer be amu&s;ed by her arti&s;ices; &s;he
had an implicite reliance on Morton; and &s;he &s;aw,
that, by the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all the con&s;iderable nobility,
the paci$ication of Scotland would be an ea&s;y, as well
as a mo&s;t important undertaking. She, therefore, or|dered
Sir William Drury, governor of Berwic, to
march with &s;ome troops and artillery to Edinburgh,
and to be&s;iege the ca&s;tle<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 449.</NOTE>. The gar$$i&s;on &s;ubmitted at

who had taken part with him, died &s;oon after a
voluntary death, as is &s;uppo&s;ed; and Scotland, &s;ubmit|ting
entirely to the regent, gave not, during a long time,
any farther inquietude to Elizabeth.</P>
<P>THE events which happened in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fr$nch affairs.</NOTE> were not
&s;o agreeable to the Queen's intere&s;ts and inclinations.
The fallacious pacifications, which had been &s;o often
made with the Hugonots, gave them good rea&s;on to
&s;u&s;pect the pre&s;ent intentions of the court; and after
all the other leaders of that party were deceived into
a dangerous credulity, the &s;agacious admiral &s;till re|mained
doubtful and uncertain. But his &s;u&s;picions were
<PB N="209" REF="228">
at la&s;t overcome, partly by the profound di&s;&s;imulation
of Charles, partly by his own earne&s;t de&s;ire to end the
mi&s;eries of France, and return again to the performance
of his duty towards his prince and country. He con|&s;idered
be&s;ides, that as the former violent conduct of
the court had ever met with &s;uch fatal &s;ucce&s;s, it was
not unlikely, that a prince, who had newly come to
years of di&s;cretion, and appeared not to be rivetted
in any dangerous animo&s;ities or prejudices, would
be induced to govern him&s;elf by more moderate
maxims. And as Charles was young, was of a pa&s;|&s;ionate
ha&s;ty temper, and addicted to plea&s;ure<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 8, 39.</NOTE>, &s;uch
deep perfidy &s;eemed either remote from his character, or
difficult, and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;o uniformly &s;up|ported
by him. Moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, the
admiral, the Queen of Navarre, and all the Hugonots
began to repo&s;e them&s;elves in full &s;ecurity, and gave
credit to the treacherous care&s;&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions of the
French court. Elizabeth her&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding her
great experience and penetration, entertained not the
lea&s;t mi&s;tru&s;t of Charles's &s;incerity; and being plea&s;ed
to find her enemies of the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e removed from
all authority, and to ob&s;erve an animo&s;ity every day
growing between the French and Spani&s;h monarchs,
&s;he concluded a defen&s;ive league with the former<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 443.</NOTE>,
and regarded this alliance as an invincible barrier to
her throne. Wal&s;ingham, her amba&s;&s;ador &s;ent her

perfidious prince.</P>
<P>THE better to blind the eyes of the jealous Hugo|nots
and draw their leaders into the &s;nare prepared
for them, Charles offered his &s;i&s;ter, Margaret, in mar|riage
to the prince of Navarre; and the admiral, with
all the con&s;iderable nobility of that party, had come to
Paris, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the celebration of the&s;e nup|tials,
<PB N="210" REF="229">
which, it was hoped, would finally, if not com|po&s;e
the differences, at lea&s;t appea&s;e the bloody ani|mo&s;ity
of the two religions. The Queen of Navarre
was poi&s;oned by orders from the court; the admiral
was dangerou&s;ly wounded by an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in: Yet Charles,
by redoubling his di&s;&s;imulation, was &s;till able to re|tain
the Hugonots in their &s;ecurity: Till on the evening
of St.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 Augu&s;t.</NOTE> Bartholomew, a few days after the marriage,
the &s;ignal was given for a general ma&s;&s;acre of tho&s;e re|ligioni&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;&s;acre
of Paris.</NOTE> and the King him&s;elf in per&s;on led the way
to the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations. The hatred long entertained
by the Pari&s;ians again&s;t the prote&s;tants, made them
&s;econd, without any preparation, the fury of the court;
and all conditions, ages and &s;exes, &s;u&s;pected of any
propen&s;ity to that religion, were involved in an undi&s;|tingui&s;hed
ruin. The admiral, his &s;on in-law Teligni,
Soubize, Rochefoucaut, Pardaillon, Piles, Lavardin;
men, who, during the late wars, had di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by the mo&s;t heroic actior were mi&s;erably
butchered without re&s;i&s;tance; the &s;treets of Paris flowed
with blood; and the people more enraged than &s;atiated
with their cuelty, as if repining that death had &s;aved
the victims from farther in&s;ult, exerci&s;ed on their dead
bodies all the rage of the mo&s;t licentious brutality.
About five hundred gentlemen and men of rank peri&s;hed
in this ma&s;&s;acre; and near ten thou&s;and of inferior con|dition<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Davila, lib. V.</NOTE>.
Orders were &s;uddenly di&s;patched to all the
provinces for a like general execution of the prote&s;|tants;
and in Ro&uuml;en, Lyons, and many other cities, the
people emulated the fury of the capital. Even the murder
of the King of Navarre, and the prince of Cond&eacute; had been
propo&s;ed by the duke of Gui&s;e; but Charles, &s;oftened by
the amiable manners of the King of Nevarre, and hop|ing
that the&s;e young princes might ea&s;ily be converted to
the catholic faith, determined to &s;pare their lives, tho' he
obliged them to purcha&s;e their &s;afety by a &s;eeming
change of their religion.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="230">
CHARLES, in order to cover this barbarous perfidy,
pretended, that a con&s;piracy of the Hugonots to &s;eize
his per&s;on had been &s;uddenly di&s;covered; and that he
had been nece&s;&s;itated, for his own defence, to pro|ceed
to this &s;everity again&s;t them. He &s;ent orders to
Fenelon, his amba&s;&s;ador in England, to a&s;k an audi|ence,
and to give Elizabeth this account of the late
tran&s;action. That mini&s;ter, who was a man of pro|bity,
abhorred the treachery and cruelty of his court,
and even &s;crupled not to declare, that he was now
a&s;hamed to bear the name of a Frenchman<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 247.</NOTE>; yet was
he obliged to obey his orders, and make u&s;e of the apo|logy,
which had been pre&s;cribed to him. He met
with that reception from all the courtiers, which, he
knew, the conduct of his ma&s;ter had &s;o well merited.
Nothing could be more awful and affecting than the
&s;olemnity of his audience. A melancholy &s;orrow &s;at
on every face: Silence, as in the dead of night, reign|ed
thro' all the chambers of the royal apartment: The
courtiers and ladies, clad in deep mourning, were rang|ed
on each &s;ide, and allowed him to pa&s;s, without
affording him one &s;alute or favourable look; till he was
admitted to the Queen her&s;elf<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Carte vol. III. p. 522. from Fenelon's Di&s;patches.</NOTE>. That prince&s;s receiv|ed
him with a more ea&s;y, if not a more gracious coun|tenance;
and heard his apology, without di&s;covering
any vi&s;ible &s;ymptoms of indignation. She then told

her judgment, till farther and more certain information
&s;hould be brought her: That the account, which he

the &s;trange irregularity of their proceedings: That the
&s;ame force, which without re&s;i&s;tance had ma&s;&s;acred &s;o
many defencele&s;s men, could ea&s;ily have &s;ecured their
per&s;ons, and have re&s;erved them for a trial, and for
puni&s;hment by a formal &s;entence, which would have
di&s;tingui&s;hed the innocent from the guilty; That the
admiral in particular, being dangerou&s;ly wounded,
and environed by the guards of the King, on who&s;e
protection he &s;eemed entirely to rely, had no means
of e&s;cape, and might &s;urely, before his death, have
been convicted of the crimes imputed to him: That it
was more worthy of a &s;overeign to re&s;erve in his own
hands the &s;word of ju&s;tice, than to commit it to bloody
murderers, who, being the declared and mortal ene|mies
of the per&s;ons accu&s;ed, employed it without mercy
and without di&s;tinction: That if the&s;e &s;entiments were
ju&s;t, even &s;uppo&s;ing the con&s;piracy of the prote&s;tants
to be real; how much more &s;o, if that crime was no|thing
but a calumny of their enemies, invented for
their ruin and de&s;truction? That if upon enquiry the
innocence of the&s;e unhappy victims &s;hould afterwards
appear, it was the King's duty to turn his vengeance
on their enemies and calumniators, who had thus cru|elly
abu&s;ed his confidence, had murdered &s;o many of
his brave &s;ubjects, and had done what in them lay to
cover him with infamy and di&s;honour: And that for her
part, &s;he &s;hould form her judgment of his intentions by
his &s;ub&s;equent conduct; and in the mean time &s;hould
act as de&s;ired by the amba&s;&s;ador, and rather pity than
blame his ma&s;ter for the extremities, to which he had
been carried<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 247, 248.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was fully &s;en&s;ible of the dangerous

and protector of that religion, was expo&s;ed to the ut|mo&s;t
fury and re&s;entment of the catholics. The violen|ces
and cruelties of the Spaniards in the Low Countries
were another branch of the &s;ame con&s;piracy; and as
Charles and Philip, two princes nearly allied in per&s;idy
and barbarity, as well as in bigotry, had now laid a&s;ide
their pretended quarrel, and had avowed the mo&s;t entire
friend&s;hip<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 26$, 282.</NOTE>, &s;he had rea&s;on, &s;o &s;oon as they had ap|pea&s;ed
their dome&s;tic commotions, to dread the effects
of their united councils. The duke of Gui&s;e al&s;o and
his family, whom Charles, in order to deceive the
admiral, had hitherto kept at a di&s;tance, had now ac|quired
an open $span$ and entire a&s;cendant in the
court of France; and &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, that the&s;e
princes, from per&s;onal as well as political rea&s;ons,
were her declared and implacable enemies. The
Queen of Scots, their near relation and clo&s;e confede|rate,
was the pretender to her throne; and tho' detain|ed
in cu&s;tody, was actuated by a re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, and be|&s;ides
her foreign allies, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very numerous and
zealous partizans in the heart of the kingdom. For
the&s;e rea&s;ons, Elizabeth thought it more prudent not
to break all terms with the French monarch; but &s;till
to li&s;ten to the profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, which he made
her. She allowed even the negotiations to be renewed
for her marriage with the duke of Alan&ccedil;on, Charles's
third brother<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. pa&s;&s;im. Camden, p. 447.</NOTE>: Tho&s;e with the duke of Anjou had

born to Charles; but before &s;he agreed to give
this la&s;t mark of conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;he thought it becom|ing

even of dete&s;tation again&s;t the cruelties exerci&s;ed on
his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 297, 298. Camden, p. 447.</NOTE>. Meanwhile, &s;he prepared
her&s;elf for that attack, which &s;eemed to threaten her

from the combined power and violence of the Roma|ni&s;ts:
She fortified Port&s;mouth, put her fleet in order,
exerci&s;ed her militia, cultivated popularity with her

Scotland under obedience to the young King, and
renewed her alliance with the German princes, who
were no le&s;s alarmed than her&s;elf at the&s;e treacherous
and &s;anguinary mea&s;ures, &s;o univer&s;ally embraced by

<P>BUT tho' Elizabeth cautiou&s;ly avoided the coming to
extremities with Charles, the greate&s;t &s;ecurity, which
&s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t his violence, was derived from the
difficulties, which the ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance of the hugo|nots
&s;till created to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">French af|fairs.</NOTE> Such of that &s;ect as lived

kingdom, took &s;helter in the neare&s;t garri&s;ons occupied
by the hugonots; and finding, that they could repo&s;e no
faith in capitulations, and expect no clemency, were
determined to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity.
The &s;ect, which Charles had thought at one blow to
exterminate, had now an army of eighteen thou&s;and
men on foot, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in different parts of the
kingdom above an hundred cities, ca&s;tles, or fortre&s;&s;es<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 343.</NOTE>;
nor could that prince deem him&s;elf &s;ecure from the in|va&s;ion
threatened him by all the other prote&s;tants of
Europe. The nobility and gentry of England were
rouzed to &s;uch a pitch of re&s;entment, that they offer|ed
to levy an army of twenty-two thou&s;and &s;oot and
four thou&s;and hor&s;e, to tran&s;port them into France,
and to maintain them &s;ix months at their own charge:

and mutually enraged from the injuries which they
had committed or received; and as all faith had been
violated and moderation bani&s;hed, it &s;eemed impracti|cable
<PB N="216" REF="237">
to frame any terms of compo&s;ition between them.
Each party had devoted it&s;elf to leaders, who&s;e com|mands
had more authority than the will of the &s;ove|reign;
and even the catholics, to whom the King was
attached, were conducted entirely by the councils of
Gui&s;e and his family. The religious connexions had,
on both &s;ides, &s;uper&s;eded the civil; or rather (for men
will always be guided by pre&s;ent intere&s;t) two em|pires
being &s;ecretly formed in the kingdom, every in|dividual
was engaged by new views of intere&s;t to fol|low
tho&s;e leaders, to whom, during the cour&s;e of pa&s;t
convul&s;ions, he had been indebted for his honours and
preforment. Henry, ob&s;erving the low condition of
the crown, had laid a &s;cheme for re&s;toring his own au|thority,
by acting as umpire between the parties, by
moderating their differences, and by reducing both
to a dependance upon him&s;elf. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the
talents of di&s;&s;imulation requi&s;ite for the execution of
this delicate plan; but being deficient in vigour, appli|cation,
and &s;ound under&s;tanding, in&s;tead of acquiring
a &s;uperiority over both factions, he lo&s;t the confidence
of both, and taught the partizans of each to adhere
more clo&s;ely to their particular leaders, whom they
$ound more hearty, cordial, and &s;incere, in the cau&s;e,
which they pur&s;ued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1576.</NOTE> The hugonots were fortified by
the acce&s;&s;ion of a German army under the prince of
Cond&eacute; and prince Ca&s;imir; but much more, by the
credit and per&s;onal virtues of the King of Navarre,
who, having fled from court, had placed him&s;elf at the
head of that formidable party. Henry, in pro&s;ecu|tion
of his plan, entered into a compo&s;ition with them;
and being de&s;irous of pre&s;erving a balance between the
&s;ects, he granted them peace on the mo&s;t advantageous
conditions. This was the fifth general peace made
with the hugonots; but tho' it was no more &s;incere on
the part of the court than any of the former, it gave
the highe&s;t di&s;gu&s;t to the catholics; and afforded the
<PB N="217" REF="238">
duke of Gui&s;e the de&s;ired pretence of declaiming
again&s;t the mea&s;ures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1576.</NOTE> and maxims, and conduct of the
King. That artful and bold leader took thence an
occa&s;ion of reducing his party into a more formed and
regular body; and he laid the fir&s;t foundations of the
famous LEAGUE, which, without paying any regard
to the royal authority, aimed at the entire &s;uppre&s;&s;ion
of the hugonots. Such was the unhappy condition of
France, from the pa&s;t &s;everities and violences of its
princes, that toleration could no longer be admitted;
and a conce&s;&s;ion for liberty of con&s;cience, which would
have probably appea&s;ed the reformers, excited the mo&s;t
violent re&s;entment and animo&s;ity in the catholics.
Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1577</NOTE> in order to divert the force of the league from
him&s;elf, $nd even to elude its efforts again&s;t the hugo|nots,
declared him&s;elf the head of that &s;editious con|federacy,
and took the field as leader of the Romani&s;ts.
But his dilatory and feeble mea&s;ures di&s;covered his
reluctance to the undertaking; and after &s;ome un&s;uc|ce&s;sful
attempts, he concluded a new peace, which,
tho' le&s;s favorable than the former to the prote&s;tants,
gave no contentment to the catholics. Mutual diffi|dence
&s;till prevailed between the parties;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1578.</NOTE> the King's
moderation was &s;u&s;picious to both; each faction con|tinued
to fortify it&s;elf again&s;t that breach, which, they
fore&s;aw, mu&s;t &s;peedily en&s;ue; theologicla controver&s;y
daily whetted the animo&s;ity of the &s;ects; and every
private injury became the ground of a public quarrel.
The King, hoping, by his artifice and &s;ubtlety, to
allure the nation into a love of plea&s;ure and repo&s;e,
was him&s;elf caught in the &s;nare; and &s;inking into
di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and indolence, wholly lo&s;t the e&s;teem,
and, in a great mea&s;ure, the affections of the nation.
in&s;tead of advancing &s;uch men of character and ability,
as were neuters between the&s;e dangerous factions,
he gave all his confidence to young agreeable favour|ites,
who, unable to prop his &s;alling authority, leaned
<PB N="218" REF="239">
entirely upon it, and encrea&s;ed the general odium again&s;t
his admini&s;tration. The public burthens, encrea&s;ed
by his profu&s;e liberality, and feeling more heavy on a
di&s;ordered kingdom, became another ground of com|plaint;
and the uncontrouled animo&s;ity of parties,
joined to the multiplicity of taxes, rendered peace more
calamitous than any open &s;tate of foreign or even do|me&s;tic
ho&s;tility.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1579.</NOTE> The artifices of the King were too
refined to &s;ucceed, and too frequent to be concealed;
and the plain, direct, and avowed conduct of the duke
of Gui&s;e on the one &s;ide, and that of the King of Na|varre
on the other, drew by degrees the generality of
the nation to devote them&s;elves without re&s;erve to the
one or the other of tho&s;e great leaders.</P>
<P>THE civil commotions of France were of too great
importance to be overlooked by the other princes of
Europe; and Elizabeth's fore&s;ight and vigilance, tho'
&s;omewhat re&s;trained by her frugality, led her to take
&s;ecretly &s;ome part in them. Be&s;ides employing on all
occa&s;ions her good offices in favour of the hugonots,
&s;he had expended no incon&s;iderable &s;ums of money in
levying that army of Germans, which the prince of
Cond&eacute; and prince Ca&s;imir conducted into France<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 452.</NOTE>;
and notwith&s;tanding all her negotiations with the court,
and her profe&s;&s;ions of amity, &s;he always con&s;idered
her own intere&s;ts as connected with the pro&s;perity of
the French prote&s;tants and the depre&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e
of Gui&s;e. Philip, on the other hand, had declared
him&s;elf protector of the league; had entered into the
clo&s;e&s;t corre&s;pondence with Gui&s;e; and had employed
all his authority in &s;upporting the credit of that fac|tious
leader. The &s;ympathy of religion, which of it|&s;elf
begot a connexion of intere&s;ts, was one con&s;ide|rable
inducement; but that monarch had al&s;o in view,
the &s;ubduing his rebellious &s;ubjects in the Netherlands;
who, as they received great encouragement from the
<PB N="219" REF="240">
French prote&s;tants, would, he hoped, finally de&s;pair of
&s;ucce&s;s, after the entire &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of their friends and
confederates.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame political views, which engaged Elizabeth
to &s;upport the hugonots, would have led her to a&s;&s;i&s;t
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed prote&s;tants in the Low Countries;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil wars of the Low Countries.</NOTE> but
the mighty power of Philip, the tranquillity of all his
other dominions, and the great force, which he main|tained
in the&s;e mutinous provinces, kept her in awe,
and obliged her, notwith&s;tanding all temptations and
all provocations, to pre&s;erve &s;ome terms of amity with
that monarch. The Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador remon&s;trated
to her, that many of the Flemi&s;h exiles, who infe&s;ted
the &s;eas, and preyed on his ma&s;ter's &s;ubjects, were re|ceived
into the harbours of England, and were there
permitted to di&s;po&s;e of their prizes; and by the&s;e re|mon&s;trances
the Queen found her&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;i|ty
of denying them all entrance into her dominions.
But this mea&s;ure proved in the i&s;&s;ue extremely preju|dicial
to the intere&s;ts of Philip. The&s;e de&s;perate exiles,
finding no longer any po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, were
forced to attempt the mo&s;t perilous enterprizes; and
they made an a&s;&s;ault on the Brille, a &s;eaport town in
Holland, where they met with &s;ucce&s;s, and, after a
&s;hort re&s;i&s;tance, became ma&s;ters of the place<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 443.</NOTE>. The
duke of Alva was alarmed with the danger; and &s;top|ping
tho&s;e bloody executions, which he was making
on the defencele&s;s Flemings, he ha&s;tened with his ar|my
to extingui&s;h the flame, which, falling on mate|rials
&s;o well prepared for combu&s;tion, &s;eemed to me|nace
a general conflagration. His fears &s;oon appear|ed
to be well grounded. The people in the neigh|bourhood
of the Brille, enraged by that complication
of cruelty, oppre&s;&s;ion, in&s;olence, u&s;urpation, and per|&s;ecution,
under which they laboured, flew to arms;
and in a few days almo&s;t the whole province of Hol|land
<PB N="220" REF="241">
and that of Zealand had revolted from the Spa|niards, and had openly declared again&s;t the tyranny o$
Alva. This event happened in the year 1572.</P>
<P>WILLIAM, prince of Orange, de&s;cended from a &s;o|vereign
family of great lu&s;tre and antiquity in Germa|ny,
inheriting the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of a &s;overeign family in
France, had fixed his re&s;idence in the Low Countries;
and on account of his noble birth and immen&s;e riches,
as well as of his per&s;onal virtues, was univer&s;ally regard|ed
as the greate&s;t &s;ubject, who lived in tho&s;e provin|ces.
He had oppo&s;ed by all regular and dutiful means
the progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h u&s;urpations; and when Al|va
conducted his army into the Netherlands, and a&s;&s;u|med
the government, this prince, well acquainted with
the violent character of the man, and the tyrannical
&s;pirit of the court of Madrid, wi&s;ely fled from the dan|ger
which threatened him, and retired to his paternal
e&s;tate and dominions in Germany. He was cited to
appear before Alva's tribunal, was condemned in ab|&s;ence,
was declared a rebel, and his ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
in the Low Countries were confi&s;cated. In revenge,
he levied an army of prote&s;tants in the empire, and made
&s;ome attempts to re&s;tore the Flemings to liberty; but
was &s;till repul&s;ed with lo&s;s by the vigilance and military
conduct of Alva, and by the great bravery as well as
di&s;cipline, of tho&s;e veteran Spaniards who &s;erved un|der
that general. The revolt of Holland and Zea|land,
provinces which the prince of Orange formerly
commanded, and where he was infinitely beloved, cal|led
him anew from his retreat; and he added conduct,
no le&s;s than &s;pirit, to that ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, which
was here made to the Spani&s;h dominion. By uniting
the revolted towns into a league, he laid the founda|tion
of that illu&s;trious commonwealth, the offspring
of indu&s;try and liberty, who&s;e arms and policy have
made long &s;o &s;ignal a figure in every tran&s;action of Eu|rope.
He inflamed the inhabitants by every motive,
<PB N="221" REF="242">
which religion, re&s;entment, or love of freedom could
in&s;pire. Tho the pre&s;ent greatne&s;s of the Spani&s;h mo|narchy
might deprive them of all courage, he &s;till flat|tered
them with the concurrence of the other provinces,
and with a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the neighbouring &s;tates; and
he exhorted them, in defence of their religion, their
liberties, their lives, to endure the utmo&s;t extremities
of war. From this &s;pirit proceeded the de&s;perate de|fence
of Harlem; a defence, which nothing but the
mo&s;t con&s;uming famine could overcome, and which
the Spaniards revenged by the execution of more than
two thou&s;and of the inhabitants<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, lib. 7.</NOTE>. This extreme &s;e|verity,
in&s;tead of &s;triking terror into the Hollanders,
animated them by de&s;pair; and the vigorous re&s;i&s;tance
made at Alemaer, where Alva was finally repul&s;ed,
&s;howed them that their in&s;olent enemies were not
wholly invincible. The duke, finding at la&s;t the per|nicious
effects of his violent councils, &s;ollicited to be
recalled from the government: Medina-celi, who was
appointed his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, refu&s;ed to accept the charge:
Reque&s;ens, commendator of Ca&s;tile, was &s;ent from
Italy to replace Alva; and this tyrant departed from
the Netherlands in 1574; leaving his name in execra|tion
to the inhabitants, and boa&s;ting in his turn, that,
during the cour&s;e of five years government, he
had delivered above eighteen thou&s;and of the&s;e re|bellious
heretics into the hands of the executio|ner<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Grotius, lib. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>REQUESENS, tho' a man of milder di&s;po&s;itions, could
not appea&s;e the violent hatred, which the revolted
Hollanders had entertained again&s;t the Spani&s;h govern|ment;
and the war continued as ob&s;tinate as ever. In
the &s;iege of Leyden, undertaken by the Spaniards, the
Dutch opened the dykes and &s;luices, in order to drive
them from that enterprize; and the very pea&s;ants were
active in ruining their fields by an inundation, rather
<PB N="222" REF="243">
than fall again under the hated tyranny of Spain. But
notwith&s;tanding this repul&s;e, the governor &s;till pur&s;ued
the war; and the conte&s;t &s;eemed too unequal between
&s;o mighty a monarchy, and two &s;mall provinces, how|ever
fortified by nature, and however defended by
the de&s;perate re&s;olution of the inhabitants. The prince
of Orange, therefore, in 1575, was re&s;olved to &s;ue
for foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to make applications to one
or other of his great neighbours, Henry or Elizabeth.
The court of France was not exempt from that &s;pi|rit
of tyrannny and per&s;ecution which prevailed
among the Spaniards; and that kingdom, torne by do|me&s;tic
di&s;&s;en&s;ions, &s;eemed not to enjoy, at pre&s;ent, ei|ther
lei&s;ure or ability to pay regard to foreign intere&s;ts.
But England, long connected both by commerce and
alliance with the Netherlands, and now more concern|ed
in the fate of the revolted provinces by a &s;ympathy
in religion, &s;eemed naturally intere&s;ted in their defence;
and as Elizabeth had ju&s;tly entertained great jealou&s;y
again&s;t Philip, and governed her powerful and opulent
kingdom in perfect tranquillity, great hopes were en|tertained,
that her policy, her ambition, or her gene|ro&s;ity,
would engage her to &s;upport them under their
pre&s;ent calamities. They &s;ent, therefore, a &s;olemn
emba&s;&s;y to London, con&s;i&s;ting of St. Aldegonde, Dou|za,
Nivelle, Buys, and Mel&s;en; and after employing
the mo&s;t humble &s;upplicationis to the Queen, they pro|ferred
her the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and &s;overeignty of their pro|vinces,
if &s;he would employ her power in thier de|fence.</P>
<P>THERE
were many &s;trong motives which might im|pel
Elizabeth to accept of liberal an offer. She was ap|prized
of the injuries which Philip had done her, by
his intrigues with the malecontents in England and
Ireland<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Digg$, p. 73.</NOTE>: She was di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee a violent and
military government erected in her neighbourhood:
<PB N="223" REF="244">
She fore&s;aw the danger which &s;he &s;hould incur from a
total prevalence of the catholics in the Low Countries:
And the maritime &s;ituation of tho&s;e provinces, as well
as their command over the great rivers, was a very
inviting circum&s;tance to a nation like the Engli&s;h, who
were beginning to cultivate commerce and naval
power. But this prince&s;s, tho' magnanimous, had
never entertained the ambition of making conque&s;ts, or
gaining new acqui&s;itions; and the whole purpo&s;e of
her vigilant and active politics, was to maintain, by
the mo&s;t frugal and cautious expedients, the tranquil|lity
of her own dominions. An open war with the
Spani&s;h monarchy was the apparent con&s;equence of
her accepting the dominion of the&s;e provinces; and
after taking the inhabitants under her protection,
&s;he could never afterwards in honour abandon them,
but, however de&s;perate their defence might become,
&s;he mu&s;t embrace it, even farther than her convenience
or intere&s;t would permit. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, &s;he re|fu&s;ed,
in plain terms, the &s;overeignty profered her;
but told the amba&s;&s;adors, that, in return for the good-will
which the prince of Orange and the States had
&s;hown her, &s;he would endeavour to mediate an
agreement for them, on the mo&s;t rea&s;onable conditions
which could be obtained<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 453, 454.</NOTE>. She &s;ent accordingly Sir
Henry Cobham to Philip; and repre&s;ented to him, the
danger which he would incur of lo&s;ing all the Low-Countries,
if France could obtain the lea&s;t interval
from her inte&s;tine di&s;orders, and find lei&s;ure to offer
her protection to the mutinous and di&s;contented inha|bitants.
Philip &s;eemed to take this remon&s;trance in
good part; but no accord en&s;ued, and the war con|tinued
with the &s;ame rage and violence as before.</P>
<P>IT was an accident that delivered the Hollanders
from their pre&s;ent de&s;perate &s;ituation. Reque&s;ens, the
governor, dying &s;uddenly, the Spani&s;h troops, di&s;|contented
<PB N="224" REF="245">
for want of pay, and licentious for want
of a proper authority to commend them, broke out
into a furious mutiny; and threw every thing into
confu&s;ion. They &s;acked and pillaged the cities of
Mae&s;tricht and Antwerp, and committed great &s;laugh|ter
on the inhabitants: They threatned all the other
cities with a like fate: And all the provinces, ex|cepting
Luxembourg, united for mutual defence
again&s;t their violence, and called in the prince of
Orange and the Hollander, as their protectors. A
treaty, commonly called the Pacification of Ghent,
was formed by common agreement; where the re|moval
of foreign troops, and the re&s;toration of their
ancient liberties, were the objects which the provin|ces
&s;tipulated to pur&s;ue. Don John of Au&s;fria, natu|ral
brother to Philip, being appointed governor, found,
on his arrival at Luxembourg, that the States had &s;o
fortified them&s;elves, and $hat the Spani&s;h troops were
&s;o divided by their &s;ituation, that there was no po&s;&s;ibi|lity
of re&s;i&s;tance; and he agreed to the terms re|quired
of him. The Spaniards were recalled; and
the&s;e provinces &s;eemed at la&s;t to breathe a little from
their calamities.</P>
<P>BUT it was not ea&s;y for an entire peace to be &s;ettled,
while the thir&s;t of revenge and dominion governed the
King of Spain, and while the Flemings were &s;o
&s;trongly agitated with re&s;entment of pa&s;t, and fear of
future injuries. The ambition of Don John, who
coveted this great theatre for his military talents, en|gaged
him rather to enflame than appea&s;e the quarrel;
and as he found the States determined to impo&s;e very
&s;trict limitations on his authority, he broke all arti|cles,
&s;eized Namur, and procured the recall of the
Spani&s;h army from Italy. This prince, endowed with
a lofty genius, and animated by the pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;es
of his youth, had opened his mind to va&s;t under|takings;
and looking much beyond the conque&s;t of
<PB N="225" REF="246">
the revolted provinces, had projected to marry the
Queen of Scots, and to acquire in her right the domi|nion
of the Briti&s;h kingdoms<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 466. Grotius, lib. iii.</NOTE>. Elizabeth was aware
of his intentions; and &s;eeing now, from the union of
all the provinces, a fair pro&s;pect of making a long and
vigorous defence again&s;t Spain, &s;he no longer &s;crupled
to embrace the protection of their liberties, which
&s;eemed to be &s;o intimately connected with her own
&s;afety. After &s;ending them a &s;um of money, about
twenty thou&s;and pounds, for the immediate pay of
their troops, &s;he concluded a treaty with them; in
which &s;he &s;tipulated to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with five thou&s;and
foot and a thou&s;and hor&s;e, at the charge of the
Flemings; and to lend them a hundred thou&s;and
pounds, on receiving the bonds of &s;ome of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable towns of the Netherlands, for her re|payment
within the year. It was farther agreed, that
the commander of the Engli&s;h army, &s;hould be admit|ted
into the council of the States; and nothing be
determined concerning war or peace, without previou&s;ly
informing the Queen or him of it; that they &s;hould
enter into no league without her con&s;ent; that if
any di&s;cord aro&s;e among them&s;elves, it &s;hould be re|ferred
to her arbitration; and that, if any prince, on any
pretext, &s;hould attempt ho&s;tilities again&s;t her, they &s;hould
&s;end to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance an army equal to that which &s;he had
employed in their defence. This alliance was &s;igned
on the 7th of January, 1578<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 466.</NOTE>. One con&s;iderable in|ducement
to the Queen for entering into treaty with
the States, was to prevent their throwing them&s;elves
into the arms of France; and &s;he was de&s;irous to make
the King of Spain believe, that it was her &s;ole motive.
She repre&s;ented to him, by her amba&s;&s;ador, Thomas
Wilkes, that &s;he had hitherto acted religiou&s;ly the
part of a good neighbour and ally; had refu&s;ed the
&s;overeignty of Holland and Zealand, when profered

her; had coun&s;elled the prince of Orange to &s;ubmit
to the King; and had even accompanied her advice
with menaces, in ca&s;e of his refu&s;al. She per&s;evered,
&s;he &s;aid, in the &s;ame friendly intentions; and, as a
proof of it, would venture to interpo&s;e with her advice
for the compo&s;ure of the pre&s;ent differences: Let Don
John, whom &s;he could not but regard as her mortal
enemy, be recalled; let &s;ome other prince more popu|lar
be &s;ub&s;tituted in his place; let the Spani&s;h armies
be withdrawn; let the Flemings be re&s;tored to their
ancient liberties and privileges: And if, after the&s;e
conce&s;&s;ions, they were &s;till ob&s;tinate not to return to
their duty, &s;he promi&s;ed to join her arms to tho&s;e of
the King of Spain, and force them to a compliance.
Philip di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment again&s;t the Queen;
and &s;till continued to &s;upply Don John with money
and troops. That prince, tho' once repul&s;ed at Rime|nant,
by the valour of the Engli&s;h under Norris, and
tho' oppo&s;ed, as well by the army of the States as by
prince Ca&s;imir, who had conducted to the Low Coun|tries
a great body of Germans, paid by the Queen,
gained a great advantage over the Flemings at Gem|blours;
but was cut off in the mid&s;t of his pro&s;perity
by poi&s;on, given him &s;ecretly, as was &s;u&s;pected, by
orders from Philip, who dreaded his ambition. The
prince of Parma &s;ucceeded to the command, who
uniting valour and clemency, negociation and military
exploits, made great progre&s;s again&s;t the revolted
Flemings, and advanced the progre&s;s of the Spaniards
by his arts as well as by his arms.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e years, while Europe was almo&s;t every
where in great commotion, England enjoyed a pro|found
tranquillity; owing chiefly to the prudence and
vigour of the Queen's admini&s;tration, and to the wi&s;e
precautions which &s;he employed in all her mea&s;ures.
By &s;upporting the zealous prote&s;tants in Scotland, &s;he
had twice given them the &s;uperiority over their anta|goni&s;ts,
<PB N="227" REF="250">
had connected their intere&s;ts clo&s;ely with her
own, and had procured her&s;elf entire &s;ecurity from
that quarter, whence the mo&s;t dangerous inva&s;ions
could be made upon her. She &s;aw in France her
enemies, the Gui&s;es, tho' extremely powerful, yet
counterballanced by the Hugonots, her zealous parti|zans;
and even hated by the King, who was jealous
of their re&s;tle&s;s and exorbitant ambition. The bigotry
of Philip gave her ju&s;t ground of anxiety; but the
&s;ame bigotry had happily excited the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate op|po&s;ition
among his own &s;ubjects, and had created him
enemies, which his arms and policy were not likely
&s;oon to overcome. The Queen of Scots, her antago|ni&s;t
and rival, and the pretender to her was a
pri&s;oner in her hands; and by her impatience and high
&s;pirit had been engaged in practices which afforded the
Queen a pretence for rendring her con&s;inement more
rigorous, and for cutting off her communication with
her partizans in England. Religion was the capital
point, on which depended all the political tran&s;actions
of that age; and the Queen's conduct in this particu|lar,
making allowance for the prevailing prejudices of
the age, could &s;carcely be accu&s;ed of &s;everity or im|prudence.
She e&s;tabli&s;hed no inqui&s;ition into men's
bo&s;oms; &s;he impo&s;ed no oaths of &s;upremacy, except
on tho&s;e who received tru&s;t or emolument from the pub|lic:
And tho' the exerci&s;e of all religion but the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
was prohibited, the violation of this law, by
the &s;aying ma&s;s, and receiving the &s;acrament, in private
hou&s;es, was, in many in&s;tances, connived at<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 459.</NOTE>; while,
at the &s;ame time, the catholics, in the beginning of
her reign, &s;hewed little reluctance again&s;t going to
church, or frequenting the ordinary duties of public
wor&s;hip. The pope, &s;en&s;ible that this practice would
by degrees reconcile all his partizans to the $$formed
<PB N="228" REF="251">
religion, ha&s;tened the publication of the bull excom|municating
the Queen, and freeing her &s;ubjects from
all oaths of allegiance; and great pains were taken
by the emi&s;&s;aries of Rome, to render the breach be|tween
the two religions as wide as po&s;&s;ible, and to make
the frequenting proten&s;tant churches appear highly cri|minal
to the catholics<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;i$$am's Letter in Burnet, vol. II. 418. Cabbala, p. 406.</NOTE>. The&s;e practices, with the
rebellions, which en&s;ued, increa&s;ed the vigilance and
&s;everity of the goverment; but the Romani&s;ts, if their
condition was compared with that of the Nonconfor|mi&s;ts
in other countries, and with their own practices
where they domineered, could not ju&s;tly complain
much of violence or per&s;ecution. The Queen appeared
rather more anxious to keep a &s;trict hand over the
puritans; who, tho' their preten&s;ions were not &s;o im|mediately
dangerous to her authority, &s;eemed to be
actuated by a more unrea&s;onable ob&s;tinacy, and to re|tain
claims, of which, both in civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical
matters, it was, as yet, difficult to di&s;cern the full &s;cope
and intention. Some &s;ecret attempts of that &s;ect to
e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;eparate congregation and di&s;cipline, had
been carefully repre&s;&s;ed in the beginning of this reign<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Parker, p. 342. Ibid. Life of Grindal, p. 315.</NOTE>
and when any of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy di&s;covered a ten|dency
to their principles, by omitting the legal habits
or ceremonies, the Queen had &s;hewn a determined re|&s;olution
to puni&s;h them by fines and deprivations<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 165, 166.</NOTE>;
tho' her orders to that purpo&s;e had, by the protection
which the&s;e &s;ectaries received from &s;ome of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable courtiers, been frequently eluded. But
what chiefly tended to gain Elizabeth the hearts of her
&s;ubjects, was, her frugality, which, tho' carried &s;ome|times
to an extreme, led her not to ama&s;s trea&s;ures,
but only to prevent impo&s;itions upon the people, who
<PB N="229" REF="252">
were at that time very little accu&s;tomed to bear the
burthens of government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1579.</NOTE> By means of her rigid oeco|nomy,
&s;he paid all the debts which &s;he found on the
crown, with their full intere&s;t; tho' &s;ome of the&s;e
debts had been contracted even during the reign of her
father<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 245, Camden, p. 446.</NOTE>. She repaid &s;ome loans, which &s;he had exacted
at the commencement of her reign; a practice in that
age &s;omewhat unu&s;ual<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 246.</NOTE>: And &s;he e&s;tabli&s;hed her credit
on &s;uch a footing, that no &s;overeign in Europe could
more readily command any &s;um which the public exi|gences
might at any time require<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p, 245.</NOTE>. During this peace|able
and uniform government, England furni&s;hes few
materials for hi&s;tory; and except the &s;mall part which
Elizabeth took in foreign tran&s;actions, there &s;carce
pa&s;&s;ed any occurrence which requries a particular
detail.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t memorable event in this period was a
&s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> &s;ummoned on the 8th of Febru|ary,
1576, where debates were &s;tarted, which may ap|pear
&s;omewhat curious and &s;ingular. Peter Went|worth,
a puritan, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in for|mer
Parliaments, by his free and undaunted &s;pirit,
opened this &s;e&s;&s;ion with a premeditated harangue,
which drew on him the indignation of the hou&s;e, and
gave great offence to the Queen and the courtiers. As
it &s;eems to contain the fir&s;t rude &s;ketch of tho&s;e prin|ciples
of liberty which happily gained afterwards the
a&s;cendant in England, it may not be improper to give,
in a few words, the &s;ub&s;tance of it. He premi&s;ed,
that the very name of liberty is &s;weet; but the thing
it&s;elf is precious beyond the mo&s;t ine&s;timable trea&s;ure:
And that it behoved them to be careful, le&s;t, con|tenting
them&s;elves with the &s;weetne&s;s of the name,
they forego the &s;ub&s;tance, and abandon what of all
earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions was of the highe&s;t value to the king|dom.
He then proceeded to ob&s;erve, that freedom of
<PB N="230" REF="253">
&s;peech in that hou&s;e, a privilege &s;o u&s;eful both to &s;o|vereign
and &s;ubject, had been formerly infringed in
many e&s;&s;ential articles, and was, at pre&s;ent, expo&s;ed to
the mo&s;t imminent danger: That it was u&s;ual, when
any &s;ubject of importance was handled, e&s;pecially if
it regarded religion, to &s;urmize, that the&s;e topics
were di&s;agreeable to the Queen, and that the farther
proceeding in them would draw down her indigna|tion
upon their temerity: That Solomon had ju&s;tly
affirmed the King's di&s;plea&s;ure to be a me&s;&s;enger of
death; and it was no wonder that men, even tho'
urged by motives of con&s;cience and duty, &s;hould be
inclined to &s;top &s;hort, when they found them&s;elves ex|po&s;ed
to &s;o &s;evere a penalty: That by employing this
argument, the hou&s;e was incapacitated from &s;erving
their country, or even from &s;erving the Queen her&s;elf;
who&s;e ears, be&s;ieged by pernicious flatterers, were there|by
rendered inacce&s;&s;ible to the mo&s;t &s;alutary truths:
That it was a mockery to call an a&s;&s;embly a Parlia|ment,
and yet deny them that privilege, which was
&s;o e&s;&s;ential to their being, and without which they
mu&s;t degenerate into an abject &s;chool of &s;ervitude and
di&s;&s;imulation: That as the Parliament was the great
guardian of the laws, they ought to have liberty to
di&s;charge their tru&s;t, and to maintain that authority
whernce even Kings them&s;elves derive their being:
That a King was con&s;tituted &s;uch by law, and tho' he
was not dependant on man, yet was he &s;ubordinate to
God and the law, and was obliged to make their pre|&s;criptions,
not his own will, the rule of his conduct:
That even his commi&s;&s;ion, as God's vicegerent, en|forced,
in&s;tead of loo&s;ening, this obligation; &s;ince he
was thereby inve&s;ted with authority to execute on earth
the will of God, which is nothing but law and ju&s;tice:
That tho' the&s;e &s;urmizes of di&s;plea&s;ing the Queen by
their proceedings, had impeached, in a very e&s;&s;ential
point, all freedom of &s;peech, a privilege granted them
<PB N="231" REF="254">
by a &s;pecial law; yet was there a more expre&s;s and
more dangerous inva&s;ion made on their liberties, by
frequent me&s;&s;ages from the throne: That it had be|come
a practice, when the hou&s;e were entering on
any que&s;tion, either eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil, to bring an
order from the Queen, inhibiting them ab&s;olutely to
treat of &s;uch matters, and barring them all farther di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion
of the&s;e momentuous articles: That the pre|laters,
emboldened by her royal protection, had a&s;&s;um|ed
a deci&s;ive power in all que&s;tions of religion, and
required that every one &s;hould implicitly &s;ubmit his
faith to their arbitrary determinations: That the love
which he bore his &s;overeign, forbad him to be &s;ilent
under &s;uch abu&s;es, or to &s;acrifice, on this important oc|ca&s;ion,
his duty to &s;ervile flattery and complai&s;ance:
And that, as no earthly creature was exempt from
fault, &s;o neither was the Queen her&s;elf; but in impo&s;|ing
this &s;ervitude on her faithful commons, had com|mitted
a great, and even dangerous, fault again&s;t her|&s;elf
and the whole realm<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 236, 237, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, from this &s;peech, that in the&s;e
dawnings of liberty, the parliamentary &s;tile was &s;till
crude and unformed; and that the proper decorum of
attacking mini&s;ters and coun&s;ellors, without intere&s;t|ing
the honour of the crown, or mentioning the per|&s;on
of the &s;overeign, was not as yet entirely e&s;tabli&s;h|ed.
The commons expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;plea&s;ure at this
unu&s;ual licence: They &s;eque&s;tered Wentworth from
the hou&s;e, and committed him pri&s;oner to the &s;erjeant
at arms. They even ordered him to be examined by
a committee, con&s;i&s;ting of all tho&s;e members who
were al&s;o members of the privy-council, and a report
to be made next day to the hou&s;e. This committee
met in the Star-chamber, and wearing the a&s;pect of
that arbitrary court, &s;ummoned Wentworth to appear
before them, and an&s;wer for his behaviour. But tho'
<PB N="232" REF="255">
the commons had di&s;covered &s;o little delicacy or pre|caution,
in thus confounding their own authority with
that of the Star-chamber; Wentworth under&s;tood
better the principles of liberty, and refu&s;ed to give
the&s;e coun&s;ellors any account of his conduct in Parlia|ment,
till he was &s;atisfied that they acted not as mem|bers
of the privy-council, but as a committee of the
hou&s;e<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes. p. 241.</NOTE>. He ju&s;tified him&s;elf by pleading the rigour
and hard&s;hip of the Queen's me&s;&s;ages; and notwith|&s;tanding
that the committee &s;hewed him, by in&s;tances
in other reigns, that the practice of &s;ending &s;uch me&s;|&s;ages
was not unprecedented, he would not agree to
expre&s;s any &s;orrow or repentance. The i&s;&s;ue of the
affair was, that, after a month's confinement, the Queen
&s;ent to the commons, informing them, that, from her
&s;pecial grace and favour, &s;he had re&s;tored him $word$
to his liberty and to his palce in the hou&s;e<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 244.</NOTE>. By this
&s;eeming lenity, &s;he indirectly retained the power
which &s;he had a&s;&s;umed, of impri&s;oning the members,
and obliging them to an&s;wer before her for their con|duct
in Parliament. And Sir Walter Mildmay en|deavoured
to make the hou&s;e &s;en&s;ible of her Maje&s;ty's
goodne&s;s, in &s;o gently remitting the indignation which
&s;he might ju&s;tly conceive at the temerity of their mem|ber:
But he informed them, that they had not the li|berty
of &s;peaking what and of whom they plea&s;ed;
and that indi&s;creet freedoms u&s;ed in that hou&s;e, had,
both in the pre&s;ent and foregoing ages, met with a
proper puni&s;hment. He warned them, therefore, not
to abu&s;e farther the Queen's clemency; le&s;t &s;he be con|&s;trained,
contrary to her inclination, to turn an un|&s;ucce&s;sful
lenity into a nece&s;&s;ary &s;everity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 259.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE behaviour of the two hou&s;es was, in other re|&s;pects,
equally tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. In&s;tead of a bill,
which was at fir&s;t introduced<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 252.</NOTE>, for the reformation of
<PB N="233" REF="256">
the church, they were contented to pre&s;ent a petition
to her maje&s;ty for that purpo&s;e: And when &s;he told
them, that &s;he would give orders to her bi&s;hops, to
amend all abu&s;es, and if they were negligent, &s;he would
her&s;elf, by her &s;upreme power and authority over the
church, give &s;uch redre&s;s as would entirely &s;atisfy the
nation; the Parliament willingly acquie&s;ced in this &s;o|vereign
and peremptory deci&s;ion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 257.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' the commons &s;hewed &s;o little &s;pirit in oppo&s;|ing
the authority of the crown, they maintained, this
&s;e&s;&s;ion, their dignity again&s;t an incroachment of the
lords, and would not agree to a conference which,
they thought, was de&s;ired of them in an irregular man|ner.
They acknowleged, however, with all humble|ne&s;s,
(&s;uch was their expre&s;&s;ion) the &s;uperiority of the
lords: They only refu&s;ed to give that hou&s;se any rea|&s;on
for their proceedings; and a&s;&s;erted, that where
they altered a bill &s;ent them by the peers, it belonged
to them to de&s;ire a conference, not to the upper hou&s;e
to require it<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 263.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE commons granted an aid of one &s;ub&s;idy and
two fifteenths. Mildmay, in order to &s;atisfy the hou&s;e
concerning the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this grant, entered in|to
a detail of the Queen's pa&s;t expences in &s;upporting
the government, and of the increa&s;ing charges of the
crown, from the daily increa&s;e in the price of all com|modities.
He did not, however, forget to admoni&s;h
them, that they were to regard this detail as the pure
effect of the Queen's conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;ince &s;he was not
bound to yield them any account how &s;he employed
her trea&s;ure<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 246.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE greate&s;t and mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ecurity which Eli|zabeth
enjoyed during her whole reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1580.</NOTE> never ex|empted
her from vigilance and attention; but the &s;cene
began now to be more overca&s;t, and dangers gradually
multiplied on her from more than one quarter.</P>
<P>THE earl of Morton had hitherto retained Scotland
in &s;trict alliance with the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE> and had al&s;o re&s;tored
dome&s;tic traquillity: But it was not likely, that the
factitious and legal authority of a regent would long
maintain it&s;elf in a country unacquainted with law and
order; where even the natural dominion of hereditary
princes &s;o often met with oppo&s;ition and controul.
The nobility began anew to break into factions: The
people were di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;ome in&s;tances which ap|peared
of Morton's avarice: And the clergy, who com|plained
of farther incroachments on their narrow reve|nue,
joined and increa&s;ed the di&s;content of the other or|ders.
The regent was &s;en&s;ible of his dangerous &s;itu|ation;
and having dropt &s;ome previ&s;h expre&s;&s;ions, as
if he were willing or de&s;irous to re&s;ign the government,
the noblemen of the oppo&s;ite party, favourites of the
young King, laid hold of this conce&s;&s;ion, and required
that demi&s;&s;ion which he &s;eemed &s;o frankly to offer
them. James was at this time but eleven years of
age; yet Morton, having &s;ecured him&s;elf, as he imagi|ned,
by a general pardon, re&s;igned his authority into
<PB N="235" REF="258">
the hands of the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLI.</NOTE> who pretended to conduct, in
his own name, the admini&s;tration of the kingdom.
The regent retired from the government, and &s;eemed
to employ him&s;elf entirely in the care of his dome&s;tic
affairs; but either tired with this traquillity, which
appeared in&s;ipid after the agitations of ambition, or
thinking it time to throw off di&s;&s;imulation, he return|ed
again to court, acquired an a&s;cendant in the coun|cil;
and tho' he re&s;umed not the title of regent, govern|ed
with the &s;ame authority as before. The oppo&s;ite
party, after holding &s;eparate conventions, took to arms,
on pretence of delivering their prince from captivity,
and re&s;toring him to the free exerci&s;e of his govern|ment:
Queen Elizabeth interpo&s;ed by her amba&s;&s;ador,
Sir Robert Bowes, and mediated an agreement between
the factions: Morton kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the govern|ment;
but his enemies were numerous and vigilant,
and his authority &s;eemed to become every day more
precarious.</P>
<P>THE count d' Aubigney, of the hou&s;e of Lenox,
cou&s;in-german to the King's father, had been born
and educated in France; and being a young nobleman
of a good addre&s;s, and a &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, he appeared
to the duke of Gui&s;e a very proper in&s;trument for de|taching
James from the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, and connect|ing
him with his mother and her relations. He no
&s;ooner appeared at Stirling, where James re&s;ided, than
he acquired the affections of the young monoarch; and
joining his intere&s;ts with James Stuart of the hou&s;e of
Ochiltree, a young man of profligate manners, who
had acquired the King's favour, he employed him&s;elf,
under the appearance of play and amu&s;ement, in in&s;til|ling
into the tender mind of the prince new &s;enti|ments
of politics and government. He repre&s;ented to
him the inju&s;tice which had been done Mary in her de|po&s;ition,
and made him entertain thoughts, either of
re&s;igning the crown into her hands, or of a&s;&s;ociating her
<PB N="236" REF="259">
with him in the admini&s;tration<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 412, 428. Melvil, p. 130.</NOTE>. Elizabeth, alarmed
with the danger which might en&s;ue from the prevalence
of this intere&s;t in Scotland, &s;ent anew Sir Robert Bowes
to Stirling; and accu&s;ing Aubigney, now created earl
of Lenox, of an attachment to the French, warned
James again&s;t entertaining &s;uch &s;u&s;icious and danger|ous
connections<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 309.</NOTE>. The King excu&s;ed him&s;elf, by
Alexander Hume his amba&s;&s;ador; and Lenox, finding
that the Queen had openly declared again&s;t him, was
farther confirmed in his intention of overturning the
Engli&s;h intere&s;t, and particularly of ruining Morton,
who was regarded as the head of it. That nobleman
was arre&s;ted in council, accu&s;ed as an accomplice in
the late King's murder, committed to pri&s;on, brought
to trial, and condemned to &s;uffer as a traitor. He con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that Bothwel had communicated to him the de|&s;ign,
had pleaded Mary's a&s;&s;ent, and had de&s;ired his
concurrence; but he denied, that he had ever given his
approbation to that crime; and in excu&s;e for his con|cealment,
alledged the danger of revealing it, either to
Henry, who had no re&s;olution nor con&s;tancy, or to
Mary, who appeared to be an accomplice in the mur|der<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 314. Crawford, p. 333. Moy&s;e's Memoirs, p. 54.</NOTE>.
Sir Thomas Randolph was &s;ent by the Queen
to intercede in favour of Morton; and that amba&s;&s;a|dor,
not content with di&s;charging this duty of his func|tion,
engaged, by his per&s;ua&s;ion, the earls of Argyle,
Montro&s;e, Angus, Marre, and Glencarne, to enter in|to
a confederacy for protecting, even by force of arms,
the life of the pri&s;oner. The more to overawe that
nobleman's enemies, Elizabeth ordered forces to be
a&s;&s;embled on the borders of England; but this expe|dient
&s;erved only to ha&s;ten his &s;entence and executi|on<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 312.</NOTE>.
Morton died with that con&s;tancy and re&s;oluti|on
which had attended him thro' all the various events
of his life; and left a reputation, which was le&s;s di&s;put|ed
<PB N="237" REF="260">
with regard to ability than probity and virtue. But
this conclu&s;ion of the &s;cene happened not till the &s;ub|&s;equent
year.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was at this time extremely anxious on
account of every revolution in Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spani&s;h af|fairs.</NOTE> becau&s;e that
country alone, not being &s;eparated from England by
&s;ea, and bordering on all the catholic and malecontent
counties, afforded her enemies a &s;afe and ea&s;y method
of attacking her; and beacu&s;e &s;he was &s;en&s;ble, that
Mary, thinking her&s;elf abandoned by the French mo|narch,
had been engaged by the Gui&s;es to have re|cour&s;e
to the powerful protection of Philip, who, tho'
he had not yet come to an open rupture with the Queen,
was every day, both by the injuries which he commit|ted
and received, more exa&s;perated again&s;t her. That
he might retaliate for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which &s;he gave to

who had a&s;&s;aulted the Spaniards in the place
where they deemed them&s;elves the mo&s;t &s;ecure, in the

the county of Devon, having acquired con&s;iderable
riches by &s;ome depredations made on the Spaniards in
the i&s;thmus of Panama, and having there got a &s;ight of
the Pacific ocean, was &s;o &s;timulated by ambition and
avarice, that he &s;crupled not to employ his whole for|tune

at that time to all the European nations<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 4 $ 8. Stow, p. 689. luy$'$ Voyages, vol. III. p. 730, 748.</NOTE>. By

a great favourite of the Queen, he obtained her
con&s;ent and approbation; and &s;et &s;ail from Plymouth in

by the Straits of Magellan, and falling on the Spaniards,
who expected no enemy in the&s;e quarters, he took many
rich prizes, and prepared to return with the immen&s;e
booty, which he had acquired. Apprehen&s;ive of being
intercepted by the enemy, if he took the &s;ame way
homewards, by which he had reached the Pacific
Ocean, he attempted to find a pa&s;&s;age by the north of
California; and failing in that enterprize, he &s;et &s;ail
for the Ea&s;t Indies, and returned &s;afely this year by the
Cape of Good Hope. He was the fir&s;t Engli&s;hman
who &s;ailed round the Globe; and the fir&s;t commander
in chief: For Magellan, who&s;e &s;hip executed the &s;ame
adventure, died in his pa&s;&s;age. His name became very
celebrated on account of &s;o bold and fortunate an at|tempt;
but many, apprehending the re&s;entment of the
Spaniards, endeavoured to per&s;uade the Queen, that it
would be more prudent to di&s;own the enterprize, to pu|ni&s;h
Drake, and to re&s;tore the trea&s;ure. But Elizabeth,
who admired valour, and who was allured by the pro|&s;pect
<PB N="239" REF="264">
of &s;haring in the riches, determined to countenance
that gallant &s;ailor: She conferred on him the honour of
knighthood, and accepted of a banquet from him at
Deptford, on board the &s;hip which had atchieved &s;o
memorable a voyage. When Philip's amba&s;&s;ador,
Mendoza, exclaimed again&s;t Drake's pyracies, &s;he told
him, that the Spaniards, by arrogating a right to the
whole new world, and excluding thence all other Eu|ropean
nations, who &s;hould &s;ail thither, even with a
view of exerci&s;ing the mo&s;t lawful commerce, very na|turally
tempted others to make a violent irruption into
the&s;e countries<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 480.</NOTE>. To pacify, however, the Spani&s;h
monarch, &s;he cau&s;ed part of the booty to be re&s;tored to
Pedro Sebura, a Spaniard, who pretended to be agent
for the merchants, whom Drake had &s;poiled. Having
learned afterwards, that Philip had &s;eized the money,
and had employed part of it again&s;t here&s;elf in Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1581.</NOTE>
part of it in the pay of the prince of Parma's troops,
&s;he determined to make no more re&s;titutions.</P>
<P>THERE was another cau&s;e, which induced the
Queen to take this re&s;olution: She was in &s;uch want
of money, that &s;he was obliged to a&s;&s;emble a Parlia|ment;
a mea&s;ure, which as &s;he here&s;elf openly declared,
&s;he never embraced, except when obliged by the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of her affairs. The Parliament, be&s;ides grant|ing
her a &s;upply of one &s;ub&s;idy and two fifteenths, enact|ed
&s;ome &s;tatutes for the &s;ecurity of the government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th January.</NOTE>
chiefly again&s;t the attempts of the catholics. Whoever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE>
in any way, reconciled any one to the church of
Rome, or was him&s;elf reconciled, was declared to be
guilty of trea&s;on: To &s;ay was &s;ubjected to the penal|ty

they were &s;everely reprimanded by a me&s;&s;age from

<P>THE Queen and Parliament were engaged to pa&s;s
the&s;e &s;evere laws again&s;t the catholics, by &s;ome late
di&s;coveries, which had been made of the trea&s;onable
practices of the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts. When the wor&s;hip of
the catholics was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the reformation in|troduced
into the univer&s;ities, the King of Spain re|flected,
that as &s;ome &s;pecies of literature was requi&s;ite
for the &s;upport of the&s;e doctrines and controver&s;ies, the
Romi&s;h communion mu&s;t totally decay in England,
if no means were found to give erudition to the eccle|&s;ia&s;tics;
and for this rea&s;on, he founded a &s;eminary at
Do&uuml;ay, where the catholics &s;ent their children, chiefly
tho&s;e intended for the prie&s;thood, in order to receive
the rudiments of their education. The cardinal of
Lorraine imitated this example by erecting a like
&s;eminary in his dioce&s;e of Rheims; and tho' Rome
was &s;omewhat di&s;tant, the pope would not neglect
to adorn, with a foundation of the &s;ame nature,
<PB N="241" REF="266">
that capital of orthodoxy. The&s;e &s;eminaries, found|ed
with this ho&s;tile intention, &s;ent over every year
a colony or prie&s;ts, who maintained the catholic
&s;uper&s;tition in the full height of its bigotry; and being
educated with a view to the crown of martyrdom,
were not deterred, either by danger or fatigue, from
maintaining and propagating their principles. They
infu&s;ed into all their votaries an extreme hatred
again&s;t the Queen; whom they treated as an u&s;urper,
a &s;chi&s;matic, a heretic, a per&s;ecutor of the orthodox,
and one &s;olemnly and publickly anathematized by the
holy father. Sedition, rebellion, and even &s;ometimes
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, were the expedients, by which they pro|po&s;ed
to effectuate their purpo&s;es again&s;t her; and the
&s;evere re&s;traint, not to &s;ay per&s;ecution, under which
the catholics laboured, made them the more wil|lingly
receive, from their gho&s;tly fathers, &s;uch violent
doctrines.</P>
<P>THESE &s;eminaries were all of them under the
direction of the je&s;uits, a new order of regular prie&s;ts
erected in Europe; when the court of Rome perceived,
that the lazy monks and beggarly friars, who &s;ufficed
in times of ignorance, were no longer able to defend
the ramparts of the church, a&s;&s;ailed on every &s;ide,
and that the inqui&s;itive &s;pirit of the age required a &s;ociety
more active and more learned, to oppo&s;e its dangerous
progre&s;s. The&s;e men, as they &s;tood foremo&s;t in
the conte&s;t again&s;t the prote&s;tants, drew on them the
extreme animo&s;ity of that whole &s;ect; and by a&s;&s;um|ing
a &s;uperiority over the other more numerous and
and more antient orders of their own communion,
were even expo&s;ed to the envy of their brethren:
So that it is no wonder, if the blame to which their
principles and conduct might be expo&s;ed, has, in
many in&s;tances, been much exaggerated. This re|proach,
however, they mu&s;t bear from po&s;terity, that,
by the very nature of their in&s;titution, they were en|gaged
<PB N="242" REF="267">
to pervert learning, the only effectual remedy
again&s;t &s;uper&s;tition, into a nouri&s;hment of that infirmi|ty;
and as their erudition was chiefly of the eccle&s;ia|&s;tical
and &s;chola&s;tic kind (tho' a few members have
cultivated polite literature) they were only the more
enabled, by that acqui&s;ition, to refine away the
plaine&s;t dictates of morality, and to erect a regular
&s;y&s;tem of ca&s;ui&s;try, by which prevarication, perjury,
and every crime, where it &s;erved their gho&s;tly purpo&s;es,
might be ju&s;tified and defended.</P>
<P>The je&s;uits, as devoted &s;ervants to the court of
Rome exalted the prerogative of the &s;overeign pontiff
above all earthly power; and by maintaining his au|thority
of depo&s;ing Kings, &s;et no bounds, either to his
&s;piritual or temporal juri&s;diction. This doctrine became
&s;o prevalent among the zealous catholics in England,
that the excommunication, fulminated again&s;t Eliza|beth,
excited many &s;cruples of a &s;ingular kind, to
which it behoved the holy father to provide a remedy.
The bull of Pius, in ab&s;olving the &s;ubjects from their
oaths of allegiance, required them to re&s;i&s;t the Queen's
u&s;urpation; and many Romani&s;ts were apprehen&s;ive,
that, by this clau&s;e, they were obliged in con&s;cience,
even tho' no favourable opportunity offered, to rebel
again&s;t her, and that no dangers nor difficulties could
free them from this indi&s;pen&s;able duty. But Par&s;ons
and Campian, two je&s;uits, were &s;ent over with a
mitigation and explanation of the doctrine; and they
taught their votaries, that, tho' the bull was for ever
binding on Elizabeth and her partizans, it did not
oblige the catholics to obedience, except when the &s;ove|reign
pontiff &s;hould think proper, by a new &s;ummons,
to require it<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 477.</NOTE>. Campian was afterwards detected in
trea&s;onable practices; and being put to the rack, and
confe&s;&s;ing his guilt, he was publickly executed. His
execution was ordered at the very time, when the duke
<PB N="243" REF="268">
of Anjou was in England, and pro&s;ecuted with the great|e&s;t
appearance of &s;ucce&s;s his marriage with the Queen;
and this &s;everity was probably intended to appea&s;e her
prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, and to &s;atisfy them, that, whatever
mea&s;ures &s;he might pur&s;ue, &s;he never would depart from
the principles of the reformation.</P>
<P>WHILE ho&s;tilities were daily multiplying between
Spain and England, and while Elizabeth knew, that
Philip, from re&s;entment, from bigotry, and from in|tere&s;t,
was &s;trongly, tho' &s;ecretly, induced to effect
her ruin, &s;he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecuring her&s;elf
again&s;t the efforts of &s;o powerful and politic a monarch.
The ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;tates in the Nether|lands
gave her hopes, that his force and trea&s;ure would
be wa&s;ted in &s;ubduing the&s;e provinces; but the admi|rable
conduct and rapid progre&s;s of the prince of Parma
&s;truck her with apprehen&s;ions; and as the acqui&s;ition,
which Philip, about this time, made of Portugal,
brought him a great acce&s;&s;ion of riches and naval power,
the expediency of &s;eeking the protection of &s;ome power|ful
alliance became every day the more apparent. The
animo&s;ity, which &s;till encrea&s;ed between the French
monarch and the duke of Gui&s;e, and the confederacy,
which the latter prince had &s;ecretly formed with Philip,
opened the pro&s;pect of a clo&s;e alliance between the
&s;overeigns of France and England; and the general
apprehen&s;ions, entertained by all Europe of the Spani&s;h
power, &s;eemed to require &s;ome general union for re&s;i&s;t|ing
its farther progre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE duke of Alen&ccedil;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negot$iCatio$$ of marria$$ with the duke of Anjou$</NOTE> now created duke of Anjou,
had never entirely dropped his preten&s;ions to e&s;pou&s;e
Elizabeth; and that prince&s;s, tho' her &s;uitor was near
twenty-five years younger than her&s;elf, and had no
knowlege of her per&s;on but by pictures or de&s;criptions,
was &s;till plea&s;ed with the counterfeit image, which
his addre&s;&s;es afforded her of love and tenderne&s;s. The
duke, in order to forward his &s;uit, be&s;ides employing
<PB N="244" REF="269">
his brother's amba&s;&s;ador, &s;ent over Simier, an agent
of his own; an artful man, of an agreeable conver&s;a|tion,
who, &s;oon remarking the Queen's humour, amu&s;|ed
her with gay di&s;cour&s;e, and in&s;tead of &s;erious poli|tical
rea&s;onings, which, he found, only awakened
her ambition, and hurt his ma&s;ter's intere&s;ts, introduced
every moment all the topics of pa&s;&s;ion and of gal|lantry.
The plea&s;ure, which &s;he found in this man's
&s;ociety, &s;oon produced a great familiarity between
them; and amid&s;t the greate&s;t hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, her
wi&s;e&s;t mini&s;ters had not &s;uch ready acce&s;s to her per&s;on,
as had Simier, who, on pretence of negotiation, enter|tained
her with accounts of the tender attachment
borne her by the duke of Anjou. The earl of Lei|ce&s;ter,
who had never before been alarmed with any
court&s;hip made to her, and who always tru&s;ted that
her love of dominion would prevail over her inclina|tion
to marriage, began to apprend, that &s;he was
at la&s;t caught in her own &s;nare, and that the artful
encouragement, which &s;he had given to this young
&s;uitor, had unawares engaged her affections. To ren|der
Simier odious, he availed him&s;elf of the credulity
of the times, and &s;pread reports, that that mini&s;ter
had gained an a&s;cendant over the Queen, not by any
natural principles of her con&s;titution, but by incantati|ons
and love potions. Simier, in revenge, endea|voured
to di&s;credit Leice&s;ter, and revealed to her a
&s;ecret which none of her courtiers dared to di&s;cover,
that this nobleman was &s;ecretly, without her con&s;ent,
married to the widow of the earl of E&s;&s;ex; an action,
which the Queen interpreted either to proceed from
want of re&s;pect to her, or as a violation of their
mutual attachment; and which &s;o provoked her,
that &s;he threatned to &s;end him pri&s;oner to the Tower<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 471.</NOTE>.
The quarrel went &s;o far between Leice&s;ter and the
French agent, that the former was &s;u&s;pected of having
<PB N="245" REF="270">
employed one Tudor, a bravo, to take away the life
of his enemy; and the Queen thought it nece&s;&s;ary,
by proclamation, to take Simier under her own pro|tection.
It happened, that while the Queen was
rowed in her barge on the Thames, attended by Simier,
and &s;ome of her courtiers, a &s;hot was fired which
wounded one of her bargemen; but Elizabeth finding,
upon enquiry, that the piece had been di&s;charged by
accident, gave the per&s;on his liberty, without farther
puni&s;hment. So far was &s;he from entertaining any &s;u&s;|picion
again&s;t her people, that &s;he was many times
heard to &s;ay, &startq;That &s;he would lend credit to nothing
again&s;t them, which parents would not believe of
their own children<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 471.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THE duke of Anjou, encouraged by the accounts,
which he received of the Queen's prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in his
favour, paid her &s;ecretly a vi&s;it at Greenwich; and after
&s;ome conference with her, the purport of which is not
known, he departed. It appeared, that, tho' his fi|gure
was not advantageous, he had lo&s;t no ground by
being per&s;onally known to her; and &s;oon after, &s;he
commanded Burleigh, now trea&s;urer, Su&s;&s;ex, Leice&s;ter,
Bedford, Lincoln, Hatton, and &s;ecretary Wal&s;ingham,
to concert with the French amba&s;&s;adors the terms of
the intended contract. Henry had &s;ent over on this oc|ca&s;ion
a very &s;plendid emba&s;&s;y to England, con&s;i&s;ting
of Francis de Bourbon, prince of Dauphiny, and ma|ny
con&s;iderable noblemen; and as the Queen had in a
manner the power of pre&s;cribing what terms &s;he plea&s;|ed,
the articles were &s;oon &s;ettled with the Engli&s;h
commi&s;&s;ioners. It was agreed, that the marriage &s;hould
be celebrated within &s;ix weeks after the ratification of
the articles; that the duke and his retinue &s;hould have
the exerci&s;e of their religion; that after the marriage
he &s;hould bear the title of King, but the admini&s;tration
&s;hould remain &s;olely in the Queen; that their children,
<PB N="246" REF="271">
male or female, &s;hould &s;ucceed to the crown of En|gland;
that if there be two males, the elde&s;t, in ca&s;e
of Henry's death without i&s;&s;ue, &s;hould be King of
France, the younger of England; that if there be but
one male, and he &s;ucceed to the crown of France, he
&s;hould be obliged to re&s;ide in England eight months
every two years; that the laws and cu&s;toms of England
&s;hould be pre&s;erved inviolate; and that no foreigner
&s;hould be promoted by the duke to any office in En|gland<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 484.</NOTE>.
The&s;e articles, providing for the &s;ecurity of
England, in ca&s;e of its annexation to the crown of
France, opened but a di&s;mal pro&s;pect to the Engli&s;h;
had not the age of the Queen, who was now in her
forty-ninth year, contributed very much to allay their
apprehen&s;ions of this nature. The Queen al&s;o, as a
proof of her &s;till remaining uncertainty, added a clau&s;e,
that &s;he was not bound to compleat the marriage, till
farther articles, which were not &s;pecified, &s;hall be
agreed on between the parties, and till the King of
France be certified of their agreement. Soon after the
Queen &s;ent over Wal&s;ingham, as amba&s;&s;ador to France,
in order to form clo&s;er connexions with Henry, and
enter into a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive again&s;t the
encrea&s;ing power and dangerous u&s;urpations of Spain.
The French King, who had been extremely di&s;turbed
with the unquiet &s;pirit, the re&s;tle&s;s ambition, the en|terprizing,
and yet timid and incon&s;tant di&s;po&s;ition of
Anjou, had already &s;ought to free the kingdom from
his intrigues, by opening a &s;cene for his activity in
Flanders; and having allowed him to embrace the pro|tection
of the &s;tates, had &s;ecretly &s;upplied him with men
and money for that undertaking. The pro&s;pect of &s;et|tling
him in England was for a like rea&s;on very agree|able
to that monarch; and he was de&s;irous to culti|vate,
by every expedient, the favourable &s;entiments,
which Elizabeth &s;eemed to entertain towards them.
<PB N="247" REF="272">
But this prince&s;s, tho' &s;he had gone farther in her amo|rous
dalliance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 387, 396, 408, 426.</NOTE> than could be ju&s;tified or accounted
for by any principles of policy, was not yet determined
to bring matters to a final conclu&s;ion; and &s;he con|fined
Wal&s;ingham, in his in&s;tructions, to the negotiating
conditions of a mutual alliance between France and
England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 352.</NOTE>. Henry with reluctance &s;ubmitted to hold
conferences on that &s;ubject; but no &s;ooner had Wal|&s;ingham
begun to &s;ettle the conditions of alliance, than
he was informed, that the Queen, fore&s;eeing ho&s;tility
with Spain to be the re&s;ult of this confederacy, had
declared, that &s;he would prefer the marriage with the
war, before the war without the marriage<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 375, 391.</NOTE>. The
French court, plea&s;ed with this change of re&s;olution,
broke off the conferences concerning the league, and
opened a negotiation for the marriage<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 392.</NOTE>. But matters
had not long proceeded in this train, before the Queen
again declared for the league in preference to the mar|riage,
and ordered Wal&s;ingham to renew the conferen|ces
for that purpo&s;e. Before he had leizure to bring
this point to maturity, he was interrupted by a new
change of re&s;olution<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 408,</NOTE>; and not only the court of France,
but Wal&s;ingham him&s;elf, Burleigh, and all the wi&s;e&s;t
mini&s;ters of Elizabeth, were in amaze, doubtful where
this conte&s;t between inclination and rea&s;on, love and
ambition, would at la&s;t terminate.</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of this affair, Elizabeth felt another
$word$ of intentions, from a new conte&s;t between her
rea&s;on and her ruling pa&s;&s;ions. The duke of Anjou
expected &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance of money, by which he might
be enabled to open the campaign in Flanders; and the
Queen her&s;elf, tho' her frugality made her long reluc|tant,

with his reque&s;t<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 357, 387, 388, 409, 426, 439. Rymer, XV. p. 793.</NOTE>. She &s;ent him a pre&s;ent of an
hundred thou&s;and crowns; by which, joined to his own
deme&s;nes and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his brother and the Queen
dowager, he levied an army, and took the field again&s;t
the prince of Parma. He was &s;ucce&s;sful in rai&s;ing the
&s;iege of Cambray; and being cho&s;en by the &s;tates go|vernor
of the Netherlands, he put his army into win|ter
quarters, and came over to England, in order to pro|&s;ecute
his &s;uit to the Queen. The reception, which
he met with, made him lay his account with entire
&s;ucce&s;s, and gave him certain hopes, that Elizabeth
had &s;urmounted all &s;cruples, and was finally deter|mined
to make choice of him for her hu&s;band. In the
mid&s;t of the pomp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$th No|vember.</NOTE> which attended the anniver&s;ary of
her coronation, &s;he was &s;een, after long and intimate
di&s;cour&s;e with him, to take a ring from her own finger,
and to put it upon his; and all the &s;pectators conclud|ed,
that, in this ceremony, &s;he had given him a pro|mi&s;e
of marriage, and was even de&s;irous of &s;ignifying
her intention to all the world. St. Aldegonde, amba&s;|&s;ador
from the &s;tates, di&s;patched immediately a letter
to his ma&s;ters, informing them of this great event; and
the inhabitants of Antwerp, who, as well as the other
Flemings, regarded the Queen as a kind of tutelar di|vinity,
te&s;tified their joy by bonefires and the di&s;charge
of their great ordnance<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 486. Thuan. lib. 74.</NOTE>. A puritan of Lincoln's Inn
had wrote a pa&s;&s;ionate book, which he intituled, &startq;The

by order of the Queen, and was condemned to
lo&s;e his right hand as a libeller. Such was the con|&s;tancy
and loyalty of the man, that, immediately after
the &s;entence was executed, he took off his hat with his
other hand, and waving it over his head, cried &startq;God
&s;ave the Queen.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding this attachment, which Eliza|beth
<PB N="249" REF="274">
&s;o openly di&s;covered to the duke of Anjou, the
combat of her &s;entiments was not entirely over; and
her ambition, as well as prudence, rou&s;ing it&s;elf by in|tervals,
&s;till filled her brea&s;t with doubt and he&s;itation.
Almo&s;t all the courtiers, whom &s;he tru&s;ted and favour|ed,
Leice&s;ter, Hatton, and Wal&s;ingham, di&s;covered an
extreme aver&s;ion to the marriage; and the ladies of her
bed-chamber made no &s;cruple of oppo&s;ing her re&s;olution
with the mo&s;t zealous remon&s;trances<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 486.</NOTE>. Among other
enemies to the match, Sir Philip Sidney, &s;on to Sir
Henry Sidney, lord deputy of Ireland, and nephew to
Leice&s;ter; a young man the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of that
age; u&s;ed the freedom to write her a letter, in which
he di&s;&s;waded her from her pre&s;ent re&s;olution, with an
unu&s;ual elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, as well as force of rea|&s;oning.
He told her, that the &s;ecurity of her govern|ment
depended entirely on the affections of her prote&s;|tant
&s;ubjects; and &s;he could not, by any mea&s;ure, more
effectually di&s;gu&s;t them than by e&s;pou&s;ing a prince,
who was &s;on to the perfidious Catherine, brother to the
cruel and perfidious Charles, and who had him&s;elf em|brued
his hands in the blood of the innocent and de|fencele&s;s
prote&s;tants: That the catholics were her mor|tal
enemies, and believed either that &s;he had originally
u&s;urped the crown, or was now lawfully depo&s;ed by
the pope's bull of excommunication; and nothing had
ever &s;o much elevated their hopes as the pro&s;pect of
her marriage with the duke of Anjou: That her chief
&s;ecurity at pre&s;ent again&s;t the efforts of &s;o numerous,
rich, and united a faction was, that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no
head who could conduct their dangerous enterprizes;
and &s;he her&s;elf was ra&s;hly &s;upplying that defect, by giv|ing
an intere&s;t in the kingdom to a prince, who&s;e edu|cation
had zealou&s;ly attached him to that communion:
That tho' he was a &s;tranger to the royal blood of Eng|land,
the di&s;po&s;itions of men were now &s;uch, that
<PB N="250" REF="275">
they preferred the religious to the civil connexions;
and were more influenced by the &s;ympathy of theolo|gical
opinions than by the principles of legal and here|ditary
government: That the duke him&s;elf had di&s;co|vered
a very re&s;tle&s;s and turbulent &s;pirit; and having
often violated his loyalty to his elder brother and his
&s;overeign, there remained no hopes that he would
pa&s;&s;ively &s;ubmit to a woman, whom he might think
him&s;elf intitled, in quality of hu&s;band, to command:
That the French nation, &s;o populous, &s;o much abound|ing
in &s;oldiers, &s;o full of nobility, who were devoted
to arms, and, for &s;ome time, accu&s;tomed to &s;erve for
plunder, would &s;upply him with partizans, dangerous
to a people, unwarlike and defencele&s;s like the gene|rality
of her &s;ubjects: That the plain and honourable
path, which &s;he had followed, of cultivating the affec|tions
of her people, had hitherto rendered her reign &s;e|cure
and happy; and however her enemies might &s;eem
to multiply upon her, the &s;ame invincible rampart was
&s;till able to protect and defend her: That &s;o long as
the throne of France was filled by Henry or his po&s;te|rity,
it was in vain to hope that the ties of blood would
en&s;ure the amity of that kingdom, preferably to the
maxims of policy or the prejudices of religion; and if
ever the crown devolved to the duke of Anjou, the con|junction
of France and England would prove a bur|then,
rather than a protection, to the latter kingdom:
That the example of her &s;i&s;ter Mary was &s;ufficient to
in&s;truct her in the danger of &s;uch connections; and to
prove, that the affections and confidence of the Engli&s;h
could never be maintained, where they had &s;uch rea|&s;on
to apprehend that their intere&s;ts would every moment
be &s;acrificed to tho&s;e of a foreign and ho&s;tile nation:
That notwith&s;tanding the&s;e great inconveniences, di&s;|covered
by pa&s;t experience, the hou&s;e of Bugundy, it
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, was more popular in the nation than
the family of France; and, what was of chief moment,
<PB N="251" REF="276">
Philip was of the &s;ame communion with Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1582.</NOTE> and
was connected with her by this great band of intere&s;t
and affection: And that however the Queen might re|main
childle&s;s, even tho' old age &s;hould grow upon
her, the &s;ingular felicity and glory of her reign would
pre&s;erve her from contempt; the affections of her &s;ub|jects,
and tho&s;e of all the prote&s;tants in Europe, would
defend her from attacks; and her own prudence, with|out
other aid or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would baffle all the efforts
of her mo&s;t malignant enemies<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Letters of the Sydneys, vol. I. p. 287, and &s;eq. Cabbala, p. 363.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE reflections kept the Queen in great anxiety
and irre&s;olution; and &s;he was ob&s;erved to pa&s;s &s;everal
nights without any &s;leep or repo&s;e. At la&s;t her &s;ettled
habits of prudence and ambition prevailed over her tem|porary
inclination; and having &s;ent for the duke of
Anjou, &s;he had a long conver&s;ation with him in pri|vate,
where &s;he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have made him apo|logies
for the breaking her former engagements. He
expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;gu&s;t on his leaving her; threw away
the ring which &s;he had given him; and uttered many
cur&s;es on the mutability of women, and of i&s;landers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 4 6.</NOTE>.
Soon after he went over to his government of the Ne|therlands;
lo&s;t the confidence of the States by a ra&s;h
and violent attempt on their liberties; was expelled
that country; retired into France; and there died.
The Queen, by her timely reflection, &s;aved her&s;elf from
the numerous mi&s;chiefs which mu&s;t have attended &s;o
imprudent a marriage: And the pre&s;ent di&s;tracted &s;tate
of the French monarchy, prevented her from feeling
any effects of that re&s;entment which &s;he had rea&s;on to
dread from the affront &s;o wantonly put upon that royal
family.</P>
<P>THE anxiety of the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE> from the attempts of the
Engli&s;h catholics, never cea&s;ed during the whole cour&s;e
of her reign; but the variety of revolutions which hap|pened
<PB N="252" REF="277">
in all the neighbouring kingdoms, were the &s;ource
&s;ometimes of her hopes, &s;ometimes of her apprehen&s;i|ons.
This year the affairs of Scotland &s;trongly en|gaged
her attention. The influence which the earl of
Lenox, and James Stuart, who now a&s;&s;umed the title of
earl of Arran, had acquired over the young King, was
but a &s;lender foundation of authority; while the gene|rality
of the nobles, and all the preachers, were &s;o
much di&s;contented with their admini&s;tration. The
a&s;&s;embly of the church appointed a &s;olemn fa&s;t; of
which one of the avowed rea&s;ons was the danger in
which the King &s;tood from the company of wicked
per&s;ons<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 319.</NOTE>: And on that day the pulpits re&s;ounded with
declamations again&s;t Lenox, Arran, and all the King's
pre&s;ent coun&s;ellors. When the minds of the people
were &s;ufficiently prepared by the&s;e lectures, a con&s;pi|racy
of the nobility was formed, probably with the
concurrence of Elizabeth, for &s;eizing the per&s;on of
James at Ruthven, a &s;eat of the earl of Gowry; and
the de&s;ign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23 Augu&s;t.</NOTE> being kept very &s;ecret, &s;ucceeded without
any oppo&s;ition. The leaders in this enterprize were,
the earl of Gowry him&s;elf, the earl of Marre, the lords
Linde&s;ey and Boyd, the ma&s;ters of Glamis and Oli|phant,
the abbots of Dunfermline, Pai&s;ley, and Cam|bu&s;kenneth.
The King wept when he found him&s;elf
detained a pri&s;oner; but the ma&s;ter of Glamis &s;aid, No
&startq;matter for his tears: Better that boys &s;hould weep
than bearded men:&endq; An expre&s;&s;ion which James
could never afterwards forgive<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 320.</NOTE>. But notwith&s;tanding
his re&s;entment, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit to the
pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity. He pretended an entire acquie&s;cence
in the conduct of the a&s;&s;ociators; acknowleged the de|tention
of his per&s;on to be acceptable &s;ervice; and
agreed to &s;ummon both an a&s;&s;embly of the church and
a convention of e&s;tates, in order to ratify that enter|prize.
The a&s;&s;embly, tho' they had e&s;tabli&s;hed it as
<PB N="253" REF="278">
an inviolable rule, that the King, on no account and on
no occa&s;ion, &s;hould ever intermeddle in eccle&s;ia&s;tical
matters, made no &s;cruple of taking civil affairs under
their cognizance, and of giving their verdict, that the
attempt of the con&s;pirators was acceptable to all that
feared God, or tendered the pre&s;ervation of the King's
per&s;on, and pro&s;perous &s;tate of the realm. They even
enjoined all the clergy to recommend the&s;e &s;entiments
from the pulpit; and they threatned with eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
cen&s;ures every man who &s;hould oppo&s;e the autho|rity
of the confederated lords<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 322.</NOTE>. The convention, be|ing
compo&s;ed chiefly of the&s;e lords them&s;elves, added
their &s;anction to the&s;e proceedings. Arran was con|fined
a pri&s;oner to his own hou&s;e: Lenox, tho' he had
power to re&s;i&s;t, yet rather than exite a civil war, or
be the cau&s;e of blood&s;hed<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Heylin's Hi&s;t. Pre&s;byter. p. 227. Spot&s;wood.</NOTE>, cho&s;e to retire into France,
where he &s;oon after died. He per&s;evered to the la&s;t
in his conver&s;ion to the prote&s;tant religion; which the
Scots clergy would never be per&s;uaded that he had &s;in|cerely
embraced. The King &s;ent for his family, re|&s;tored
his &s;on to his paternal honours and e&s;tate, took
care to e&s;tabli&s;h the fortunes of all his other children;
and to his la&s;t moments never forgot the early friend|&s;hip
which he had borne their father: A &s;trong proof of
the good di&s;po&s;itions of that prince<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 328.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was this revolution known in England,
than the Queen &s;ent Sir Henry Cary, and Sir Robert
Bowes to James, in order to congratulate him on his
deliverance from the pernicious coun&s;els of Lenox and
Arran; to exhort him not to re&s;ent the &s;eeming violence
of the lords' enterprize; and to procure from him per|mi&s;&s;ion
for the return of the earl of Angus, who, ever
&s;ince Morton's fall, had lived in England. They
ea&s;ily prevailed in the la&s;t application; and as James
&s;u&s;pected, that Elizabeth had not been entirely unac|quainted
<PB N="254" REF="279">
with the project of his detention, he thought
proper, before the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, to di&s;&s;emble
his re&s;entment again&s;t the confederated noblemen.
Soon after, La Mothe-Fenelon, and Menneville, ap|peared
as amba&s;&s;adors from France:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1583.</NOTE> Their errand was
to enquire concerning the &s;ituation of the King, make
profe&s;&s;ions of their ma&s;ter's friend&s;hip, confirm the an|cient
league with France, and procure an accommoda|tion
between him and the Queen of Scots. This la&s;t
propo&s;al gave great umbrage to the clergy; and the
a&s;&s;embly had already voted the &s;ettling of terms between
the mother and &s;on to be a mo&s;t wicked undertaking.
The pulpits re&s;ounded with declamations again&s;t the
French amba&s;&s;adors; particularly Fenelon, whom they
called the Me&s;&s;enger of the bloody murderer, meaning
the duke of Gui&s;e: And as that mini&s;ter, being knight
of the Holy Gho&s;t, wore a white cro&s;s on his &s;houlder,
they commonly denominated it in contempt, the badge
of Antichri&s;t. The King endeavoured, tho' in vain,
to repre&s;s the&s;e in&s;olencies; but in order to make the
amba&s;&s;adors &s;ome compen&s;ation, he de&s;ired the magi|&s;trates
of Edinburgh to give them a &s;plendid dinner be|fore
their departure, To prevent this entertainment,
the clergy appointed that very day for a public fa&s;t;
and finding that their orders were not regarded, they
employed their &s;ermons in thundering cur&s;es on the
magi&s;trates, who, by the King's direction, had put
this mark of re&s;pect on the amba&s;&s;adors. They even
pur&s;ued them afterwards with the cen&s;ures of the
church; and it was with difficulty they were prevent|ed
from pa&s;&s;ing the &s;entence of excommunication
again&s;t them, on account of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to royal,
preferably to clerical, authority<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 324.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT encrea&s;ed the alarm with regard to an ac|commodation
between James and Mary, was, that the
Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors &s;eemed to concur with the French
<PB N="255" REF="280">
in this propo&s;al;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1583.</NOTE> and the clergy were &s;o ignorant as to
credit the &s;incerity of the profe&s;&s;ions made by the for|mer.
The Queen of Scots had often made overtures
to Elizabeth, which had been entirely neglected; but
hearing of James's detention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter of Queen Mary to Eliza|beth.</NOTE> &s;he wrote a letter
in a more pathetic and more &s;pirited &s;train than
u&s;ual; craving the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that prince&s;s, both
for her own and her &s;on's liberty. She &s;aid,
that the account of her prince's captivity had ex|cited
her mo&s;t tender concern; and the experience
which &s;he her&s;elf, during &s;o many years, had of the
extreme infelicity attending that &s;ituation, had made
her the more apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t a like fate &s;hould pur|&s;ue
her unhappy offspring: That the long train of in|ju&s;tice
which &s;he had &s;uffered; the calumnies to which
&s;he had been expo&s;ed; were &s;o grievous, that, finding
no place for right or truth among men, &s;he was re|duced
to make her la&s;t appeal to heaven, the only com|petent
tribunal between princes of equal juri&s;diction, de|gree,
and dignity: That after her rebellious &s;ubjects
&s;ecretly in&s;tigated by Elizabeth's mini&s;ters, had ex|pelled
her from the throne, had confined her to pri|&s;on,
had pur&s;ued her with arms, &s;he had voluntarily
thrown her&s;elf under the protection of England, fatally
allured by tho&s;e reiterated profe&s;&s;ions of amity which
had been made her, and by her confidence in the gene|ro&s;ity
of a friend, an ally, and a kin&s;woman: That
not contented with debarring her from her pre&s;ence,
with &s;upporting the u&s;urpers of her throne, with con|tributing
to the de&s;truction of her faithful &s;ubjects,
Elizabeth had reduced her to a wor&s;e captivity than
that from which &s;he had e&s;caped, and had made her
this cruel return for the unlimited tru&s;t which &s;he had
repo&s;ed in her: That tho' her re&s;entment of &s;uch &s;evere
u&s;age had never carried her farther than to u&s;e &s;ome
di&s;appointed efforts for her deliverance, unhappy to

her&s;elf, and fatal to others, &s;he found the rigourous of
confinement daily multiplied upon her; and at length
carried to &s;uch a height as &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the bounds of all
human patience any longer to endure them: That &s;he
was cut off from all communication, not only with the
re&s;t of mankind, but al&s;o with her only &s;on; and her
maternal fondne&s;s, which was now more enlivened
by their unhappy &s;ympathy in &s;ituation, and was her
&s;ole remaining attachment to the world, deprived even
of that melancholy &s;olace, which letters or me&s;&s;ages
could give: That the bitterne&s;s of her &s;orrows, &s;till
more than her clo&s;e confinement, had preyed upon her
health, and had added the in&s;ufferable weight of Bodily
infirmity to all tho&s;e other calamities under which &s;he
laboured: That while the daily experience of her ma|ladies
opened to her the comfortable pro&s;pect of an ap|proaching
deliverance into a region where pain and
&s;orrow are no more, her enemies envied her that la&s;t
con&s;olation; and having &s;ecluded her from every joy
on earth, had done what in them lay to debar her
from all hopes in her future and eternal exi&s;tence:
That the exerci&s;e of her religion was refu&s;ed her; the
u&s;age of tho&s;e &s;acred rites in which &s;he had been edu|cated;
the commerce with tho&s;e holy mini&s;ters, whom
heaven had appointed to receive the acknowlegement
of our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and to &s;eal our penitence by a &s;o|lemn
re-admi&s;&s;ion into heavenly favour and forgive|ne&s;s:
That it was in vain to complain of the rigours
of per&s;ecution exerci&s;ed in other kingdoms; when a
Queen, and an innocent woman, was excluded from
an indulgence which neve yet, in the mo&s;t barbarous
countries, had been denied to the meane&s;t and mo&s;t cri|minal
malefactor: That could &s;he ever be induced to
de&s;cend from that royal dignity in which Providence
had placed her, or depart from her appeal to Heaven,
there was only one other tribunal to which &s;he would
appeal from all her enemies; to the ju&s;tice and humani|ty
<PB N="257" REF="284">
of Elizabeth's own brea&s;t, and to that lenity, which,
uninfluenced by malignant coun&s;el, &s;he would
naturally be induced to exerci&s;e towards her: And
that &s;he finally intreated her, to re&s;ume her natural
di&s;po&s;ition, and to reflect on the &s;upport, as well as
comfort, which &s;he might receive from her &s;on and
her&s;elf, if, joining the obligations of gratitude to the
ties of blood, &s;he would deign to rai&s;e them from
their pre&s;ent melancholy &s;ituation, and rein&s;tate
them in that liberty and authority to which they were
entitled<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 489.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH was chiefly induced to ob&s;truct Mary's
re&s;toration, becau&s;e &s;he fore&s;aw an unhappy alternative
attending that event. If this prince&s;s recovered any
con&s;iderable &s;hare of authority in Scotland, her re&s;ent|ment,
ambition, zeal, and connections, both dome|&s;tic
and foreign, might render her a dangerous neigh|bour
to England, and enable her, after &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
the Engli&s;h party among her &s;ubjects, to revive tho&s;e
preten&s;ions which &s;he had formerly advanced to the
crown, and which her partizans in both kingdoms
&s;till &s;upported with great indu&s;try and a&s;&s;urance. If
&s;he was rein&s;tated in power, with &s;uch &s;trict limitations
as could not be broken, &s;he might be di&s;gu&s;ted with her
&s;ituation; and flying abroad, form more de&s;perate
attempts than any &s;overeign, who had a crown to
hazard, would willingly undertake. Mary her&s;elf,
&s;en&s;ible of the&s;e difficulties, and convinced by experi|ence,
that Elizabeth would for ever debar her the
throne, was now become more humble in her wi&s;hes;
and as age and infirmities had repre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e &s;enti|ments
of ambition and indignation, by which &s;he was
formerly &s;o much agitated, &s;he was willing to &s;acrifice
all her hopes of power and grandeur, in order to
obtain a little more liberty; a ble&s;&s;ing to which &s;he
very naturally a&s;pired with the fonde&s;t impatience
<PB N="258" REF="285">
She propo&s;ed, therefore, that &s;he &s;hould be a&s;&s;ociated
with her &s;on in the title to the crown of Scotland,
but that the admini&s;tration &s;hould remain &s;olely in
him: And &s;he was contented to live in England, in
a private &s;tation, and even in a kind of re&s;traint; but
with &s;ome more liberty, both for exerci&s;e and company,
than &s;he had enjoyed &s;ince the fir&s;t di&s;covery of her in|trigues
with the duke of Norfolk. But Elizabeth,
who was afraid le&s;t &s;uch a loo&s;e method of guarding
her, would facilitate her e&s;cape into France or Spain,

and enable her to conduct tho&s;e intrigues to

tho' &s;he feigned to a&s;&s;ent to them, &s;he well knew how

While Lenox maintained his authority in Scotland,
&s;he never gave any reply to all the applications made
to her by the Scotti&s;h Queen<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 540.</NOTE>: At pre&s;ent, when her
own creatures had acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the govern|ment,
&s;he was re&s;olved to throw the odium of the
refu&s;al upon them; and pretending, that nothing
was required to a perfect accommodation, but the con|currence
of the council of &s;tate in Scotland, &s;he or|dered
her amba&s;&s;ador, Bowes, to open the negociation
for Mary's liberty, and her a&s;&s;ociation with her &s;on in
the title to the crown. Tho' &s;he &s;eemed to make
this conce&s;&s;ion to Mary, &s;he refu&s;ed her the liberty of
&s;ending any amba&s;&s;ador of her own; and that prince&s;s
could ea&s;ily conjecture, from this circum&s;tance, what
would be the re&s;ult of the pretended negociation. The
Scots council, in&s;tigated by the clergy, rejected all
treaty: and James, who was now a captive in their
hands, affirmed, that he had never a&s;&s;ented to an
a&s;&s;ociation with his mother, and that the matter had
<PB N="259" REF="286">

purpo&s;e<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">MS. in the Advocate's library, A. 3. 28. p. 401. from the Cott. Lib. Calig. c. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE affairs of Scotland remained not long on the
pre&s;ent footing. James, impatient of re&s;traint, made
his e&s;cape from his keepers; and flying to St. Andrews,
&s;inmmoned his friends and partizans to attend him.
The earls of Argyle, Mar&s;hal, Montro&s;e, and Rothes,
ha&s;tened to pay their duty to their &s;overeign; and the
oppo&s;ite party found them&s;elves unable to re&s;i&s;t &s;o pow|erful
a combination. They were offered a pardon,
upon their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and an acknowlegement of
their fault, in &s;eizing the King's per&s;on, and re&s;train|ing
him from his liberty. Some of them accepted of
the terms: The greater number, particularly Angus,
Hamilton, Marre, Glamis, left the country; and
took &s;helter in Ireland or England, where they were
protected by Elizabeth. The earl of Arran was re|called
to court; and the malecontents, who could
not brook the authority of Lenox, a man of virtue and
moderation, found, that, by their re&s;i&s;tance, they
had thrown all the power into the hands of a per&s;on
who&s;e councils were as violent as his manners were
profligate<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 325, 326, &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH wrote a letter to James; in which &s;he
quoted a moral &s;entence from I&s;ocrates, and indirectly
reproached him with incon&s;tancy, and a breach of his
engagements. James, in his reply, ju&s;tified his mea|&s;ures;
and turned two pa&s;&s;ages of I&s;ocrates again&s;t
her, for one which &s;he had directed again&s;t him<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 140, 141. Strype, vol. III. p. 165.</NOTE>.
She next &s;ent Wal&s;ingham in an emba&s;&s;y to him; and
her chief purpo&s;e in employing that aged mini&s;ter
on an errand where &s;o little bu&s;ine&s;s was to be tran&s;|acted,
was to learn, from a man of &s;o much penetrati|on
the di&s;cernment, the real character of James.
<PB N="260" REF="287">
This young prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very good parts,, tho'
not accompanied with that vigour and indu&s;try which
his &s;tation required; and as he excelled in general di&s;|cour&s;e
and conver&s;ation, Wal&s;ingham entertained a
higher idea of his talents than he was afterwards found,

<P>THE King of Scots, per&s;evering in his pre&s;ent views,
&s;ummoned a Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1584.</NOTE> where it was enacted, that
no clergyman &s;hould pre&s;ume, in his &s;ermons, to utter
fal&s;e, untrue, or &s;candalous &s;aying again&s;t the King,
the council, or the public mea&s;ures, or to meddle,
in an improper manner, with the affairs of his maje&s;ty
and the &s;tates<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 333.</NOTE>. The clergy, finding that the pulpit
would be no longer a &s;anctuary for them, were ex|tremely
offended: They &s;aid, that the King was be|come
popi&s;h in his heart; and they gave their adver|&s;aries
the epithets of gro&s;s libertines, belly gods, and
infamous per&s;ons<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 334.</NOTE>. The violent conduct of Arran &s;oon
brought over the popularity to their &s;ide. The earl of
Gowry, tho' pardoned for the late attempt, was com|mitted
to pri&s;on, was tried on &s;ome new accu&s;ations,
condemned, and executed. Many innocent per&s;ons
&s;uffered from the tyranny of this favourite; and the
bani&s;hed lords, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Elizabeth, now found
the time favourable for the recovery of their e&s;tates and
authority. After they had been foiled in one attempt
upon Stirling, they prevailed in another; and being ad|mitted
to the King's pre&s;ence, were pardoned, and re|&s;tored
to his favour.</P>
<P>ARRAN was degraded from authority; deprived of
that e&s;tate and title which he had u&s;urped; and the
<PB N="261" REF="288">
whole country &s;eemed to be compo&s;ed to tranquillity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1584.</NOTE>
Elizabeth, after oppo&s;ing, during &s;ome time, the cre|dit
of this favourite, had found it more expedient,
before his fall, to compo&s;e all differences with him,
by the means of Davi&s;&s;on, a mini&s;ter whom &s;he &s;ent
to Scotland: But having more confidence in the lords,
whom &s;he had helped to re&s;tore, &s;he was plea&s;ed
with this alteration of affairs; and maintained a good
corre&s;pondence with the new court and mini&s;try of
James.</P>
<P>THESE revolutions in Scotland would have been re|garded
as of &s;mall importance to the repo&s;e and &s;ecuri|ty
of Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;piracies in England.</NOTE> had her own &s;ubjects been entirely
united, and had not the zeal of the catholics, excited
by con&s;traint more properly than per&s;ecution, daily
threatened her with &s;ome dangerous in&s;urrection. The
vigilance of the mini&s;ters, particularly of Burleigh and
Wal&s;ingham, was rai&s;ed in proportion to the activity
of the malecontents; and many arts, which had been
blameable in a more peaceable government, were em|ployed
to detect con&s;piracies, and even di&s;cover the
&s;ecret inclinations of men. Counterfeit letters were
wrote in the name of the Queen of Scots, or of the
Engli&s;h exiles, and privately conveyed to the hou&s;es of
the catholics: Spies were hired to ob&s;erve the actions
and di&s;cour&s;e of &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons: Informers were
countenanced: And tho' the &s;agacity of the&s;e two
great mini&s;ters helped them to di&s;tingui&s;h the true from
the fal&s;e intelligence, many calumnies were, no doubt,
hearkened to, and all the &s;ubjects, particularly the ca|tholics,
kept in the utmo&s;t anxiety and inquietude.
Henry Piercy, earl of Northumberland, brother to the
earl beheaded &s;ome years before, and Philip Howard,
earl of Arundel, &s;on to the unfortunate duke of Nor|folk,
fell under &s;u&s;picion; and the latter was, by or|der
of the council, confined to his own hou&s;e. Fran|cis
Throcmorton, a private gentleman, was commit|ted
<PB N="262" REF="289">
to cu&s;tody, on account of a letter which he had
wrote to the Queen of Scots, and which was intercept|ed.
Lord Paget, and Charles Arundel, who had been
engaged with him in trea&s;onable de&s;igns, immediately
withdrew beyond &s;ea. Throcmorton confe&s;&s;ed, that
a plan for an inva&s;ion and in&s;urrection had been laid;
and tho', on his trial, he was de&s;irous of retracting
this confe&s;&s;ion, and imputing it to the fear of torture,
he was found guilty and executed. Mendoza, the
Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, having promoted this con&s;piracy,
was ordered to depart the kingdom; and Wade was
&s;ent into Spain, to excu&s;e his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and to de&s;ire
the King to &s;end another amba&s;&s;ador in his place: But
Philip would not &s;o much as admit the Engli&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador
to his pre&s;ence. Creighton, a Scots Je&s;uit, co|ming
over on board a ve&s;&s;el which was &s;eized, tore
&s;ome papers, with an intention of throwing them into
the &s;ea; but the wind blowing them back upon the
&s;hip, they were put together, and di&s;covered &s;ome dan|gerous
&s;ecrets<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Camber, p. 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY of the&s;e con&s;piracies were, with great appear|ance
of rea&s;on, imputed to the contrivances of the
Queen of Scots<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 246.</NOTE>; and as her name was employed in all
of them, the council thought, that they could not u&s;e
too many precautions again&s;t the danger of her claims,
and the re&s;tle&s;s activity of her temper. She was remov|ed
from under the care of the earl of Shrew&s;bury, who,
tho' vigilant and faithful in that tru&s;t, had al&s;o been
indulgent to his pri&s;oner, particularly with regard to
air and exerci&s;e: And &s;he was committed to the cu&s;to|dy
of Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drue Drury; men of
honour, but inflexible and rigid in their care and atten|tion.
An a&s;&s;ociation was al&s;o &s;et on foot by the earl of
Leice&s;ter and other courtiers; and as Elizabeth was
extremely beloved by the whole nation, except the
more zealous catholics, Men of all ranks willingly
<PB N="263" REF="290">
flocked to the &s;ub&s;cription of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1584.</NOTE> The purport of this
a&s;&s;ociation was to defend the Queen, to revenge her
death or any injury committed again&s;t her, and to ex|clude
from the throne all claimants, whatever title
they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by who&s;e &s;ugge&s;tion, or for who&s;e behoof;
any violence &s;hould be offered to her maje&s;ty<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 122, 123.</NOTE>. The
Queen of Scots was &s;en&s;ible, that this a&s;&s;ociation was
levelled again&s;t her; and to remove all &s;u&s;picion from
her&s;elf, &s;he al&s;o de&s;ired leave to &s;ub&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Novem|ber. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> that &s;he might the more di&s;courage
malecontents, by &s;hewing them the concurrence of
the nation in her favour, &s;ummoned a new Parliament;
and &s;he met with that dutiful attachment, which &s;he
expected. The a&s;&s;ociation was confirmed by Parlia|ment;
and a clau&s;e was added, by which the Queen
was empowered to name commi&s;&s;ioners for the trial of
any pretender to the crown, who &s;hould attempt or
imagine any inva&s;ion, in&s;urrection, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination
again&s;t the Queen: Upon condemnation, pronounced
by the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, the per&s;on was excluded from
all claim to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and was farther puni&s;hable,
as her maje&s;ty &s;hould direct. And for the greater &s;e|curity,
a council of regency, in ca&s;e of the Queen's
violent death, was appointed to govern the kingdom,
to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and to take vengeance of that
act of trea&s;on<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">27 Eliz. cap. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A SEVERE law was al&s;o enacted again&s;t je&s;uits and
popi&s;h prie&s;ts: That they &s;hould depart the kingdom
within forty days; that tho&s;e who &s;hould remain be|yond
that time, or &s;hould afterwards return, &s;hould
be guilty of high trea&s;on; that tho&s;e who harboured or
relieved them &s;hould be guilty of felony; that tho&s;e
who were educated in &s;eminaries, if they returned not
in &s;ix months after notice given, and &s;ubmitted not
them&s;elves, to the Queen, before a bi&s;hop or two
ju&s;tices, &s;hould be guilty of high trea&s;on: And that if
<PB N="264" REF="291">
any,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1584.</NOTE> &s;o &s;ubmitting them&s;elves, &s;hould, within ten
years, approach the Queen's court, or come within
ten miles of it, their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be void<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">27 Eliz. cap. 2.</NOTE>. By
this law, the exerci&s;e of the catholic religion, which
had formerly been prohibited under lighter penalties,
and which was, in many in&s;tances, connived at,
was totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. In the &s;ub&s;equent part of the
Queen's reign, the law was &s;ometimes executed, by the
capital puni&s;hment of prie&s;ts; and tho' the partizans of
that prince&s;s a&s;&s;erted, that they were puni&s;hed for their
trea&s;on, not their religion, the apology mu&s;t only be
under&s;tood in this &s;en&s;e, that the law was enacted on
account of the trea&s;onable views and attempts of the
&s;ect, not that every individual, who &s;uffered the penal|ty
of the law, was convicted of trea&s;on<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Some even of tho&s;e who defend the Queen's mea&s;ures, allow that in ten years fifty prie&s;ts were executed, and fifty-five bani&s;hed. Camden, p. 649</NOTE>. The catho|lics,
therefore, might now ju&s;tly complain of a very
violent per&s;ecution; which, we may &s;afely affirm, in
&s;pite of the rigid and bigotted maxims of that age, not
to be the be&s;t method of converting them, or of re|conciling
them to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government and re|ligion.</P>
<P>THE
Parliament, be&s;ides arming the Queen with
the&s;e powers, granted her a &s;upply of one &s;ub&s;idy and
two fifteenths. The only circum&s;tance, in which their
proceedings were di&s;agreeable to her, was an applicati|on,
which the commons made for a farther reformation
in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters. Yet even in this attempt,
which affected her, as well as them, in a very delicate
point, they di&s;covered how much they were overawed
by her authority. The majority of the hou&s;e were
puritans, or inclined to that &s;ect<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides the petition a ter-mentioned, another proof of the prevalency of the puritans among the commons was their pa&s;&s;ing a bill for the reverend ob&s;ervance of Sunday, which they called the Sabbath, and the depriving the people of tho&s;e amu&s;ements, which they were accu&s;tomed to take on that day. D'Ewes, p. 335. It was a &s;trong &s;ymptom of a contrary &s;pirit in the upper hou&s;e, that they propo&s;ed to add Wedne&s;day to the fa&s;t days, and to prohibit entirely the eating of fle&s;h on that day. D'Ewes, p. 373.</NOTE>; but the &s;evere re|primands,
<PB N="265" REF="292">
which they had already, in former &s;e&s;&s;ions,
met with from the throne, deterred them from intro|ducing
any bill concerning religion; a proceeding
which would have been interpreted as an incroachment
on the royal prerogative: They were contented to
proceed by way of humble petition, and that not to her
maje&s;ty, which would certainly have given &s;ome offence,
but to the hou&s;e of lords, or rather to the bi&s;hops,
who had a &s;eat in that hou&s;e, and from whom alone
they were contented to receive all advances towards
a reformation<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 357.</NOTE>. A &s;trange departure from what we
now apprehend to be the dignity of the commons!</P>
<P>THE commons de&s;ired in their humble petition, that
no bi&s;hop &s;hould exerci&s;e his function of ordination but
with the con&s;ent and concurrence of &s;ix pre&s;byters:
A demand, which as it would have introduced a change
of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, was firmly rejected by the
prelates. They de&s;ired, that no clergyman &s;hould be
in&s;tituted into any benefice, without previous warning
being given to the pari&s;h, that they might examine
whether there lay any objection to his life or doctrine:
But this attempt towards a popular model naturally
met with the &s;ame fate. In another article of the
petition, they prayed, that the bi&s;hops &s;hould not in&s;i&s;t
upon every ceremony, or deprive incumbents for omit|ting
part of the &s;ervice: As if uniformity in public
wor&s;hip had not been e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; or as if the
prelates had been endowed with a di&s;pen&s;ing power.
They complained of abu&s;es, which prevailed, in de|nouncing
the &s;entence of excommunication, and en|treated
the reverend fathers to think of &s;ome law for
the remedy of the&s;e abu&s;es: Implying, that tho&s;e mat|ters
<PB N="266" REF="293">
were too high for the commons of them&s;elves to
meddle with them.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t material article, which the commons
touched upon in their petition, was the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
commi&s;&s;ion, and the oath <HI>ex officio,</HI> as it was called,
exacted by that court. This is a &s;ubject of &s;uch impor|tance,
as to merit &s;ome explanation.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t primate after the Queen's acce&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The eccle&s;i|a&s;tical court.</NOTE> was
Parker; a man rigid in exacting conformity to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
wor&s;hip, and in puni&s;hing, by fines or depri|vations,
all the puritans, who attempted to innovate any
thing in the habits, ceremonies, or liturgy of the
church. He died in 1575; and was &s;ucceeded by
Grindal, who, as he him&s;elf was inclined to the new
&s;ect, was with great difficulty brought to execute the
law again&s;t them, or to puni&s;h the nonconforming
clergy. He declined obeying the Queen's orders for
the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of <HI>prophecyings,</HI> which, &s;he apprehended,
had become &s;o many academies of fanatici&s;m; and for
this offence, &s;he had, by an order of the Star Camber,
&s;eque&s;tered him from his archiepi&s;copal function,
and confined him to his own hou&s;e. Upon his death,
which happened in 1583, &s;he determined not to fall
into the &s;ame error in her next choice; and &s;he named
Whitgift, a zealous churchman, who had already
&s;ignalized his pen in controver&s;y, and who, having
in vain attempted to convince the puritans by argument,
was now re&s;olved to open their eyes by power, and
by the execution of penal &s;tatutes. He informed the
Queen, that all the &s;piritual authority lodged in the
prelates was in&s;ignificant without the &s;anction of the
crown; and as there was no eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion
at that time in force, he engaged her to i&s;&s;ue a new
one; more arbitrary than any of the former, and con|veying
more unlimited authority<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Neal's Hi&s;tory of the Puritans, vol. I. p. 410.</NOTE>. She appointed
forty-four commi&s;&s;ioners, twelve of whom were ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics;
<PB N="267" REF="294">
three commi&s;&s;ioners could exerci&s;e the
whole power of the court; their juri&s;diction extended
over the whole kingdom, and over all orders of men;
and every circum&s;tance of their authority, and all
their methods of proceeding, were contrary to the
cleare&s;t principles of law and natural equity. They
were empowered to vi&s;it and reform all errors, here&s;ies,
&s;chi&s;ms, in a word, to regulate all opinions, as well
as to puni&s;h all breach of uniformity in the exerci&s;e of
public wor&s;hip. They were directed to make en|quiry,
not only by the legal methods of juries and
witne&s;&s;es, but by all other means and ways, which they
could devi&s;e; that is, by the rack, by torture, by
inqui&s;ition, by impri&s;onment. Where they thought
proper to &s;u&s;pect any per&s;on, they might admini&s;ter to
him an oath, called <HI>ex Officio,</HI> by which he was bound
to an&s;wer all que&s;tions, and might thereby be obliged
to accu&s;e him&s;elf or his mo&s;t intimate friend. The
fines, which they impo&s;ed, were merely di&s;cretionary,
and often occa&s;ioned the total ruin of the offenders, con|trary
to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the kingdom. The
impri&s;onment, to which they condemned any delin|quent,
was limited by no rule but their own plea&s;ure.
They a&s;&s;umed a power of impo&s;ing on the clergy what
new articles of &s;ub&s;cription, and con&s;equently of faith,
they thought proper. Tho' all other &s;piritual courts
were &s;ubject, &s;ince the reformation, to inhibitions
from the &s;upreme courts of law, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical com|mi&s;&s;ioners
exempted them&s;elves from that legal juri&s;|diction,
and were liable to no controul. And the more
to enlarge their authority, they were empowered to
puni&s;h all ince&s;ts, adulteries, fornications; all outrages,
mi&s;behaviours, and di&s;orders in marriage: And the
puni&s;hments, which they might inflict, were according
to their wi&s;dom, con&s;cience, and di&s;cretion. In a
word this court was a real <HI>inqui&s;ition;</HI> attended with
all the iniquities, as well as cruelties, in&s;eparable from
<PB N="268" REF="295">
that horrid tribunal. And as the juridiction of the
eccle&s;ia&s;tical court was de&s;tructive of all law, &s;o its
erection was deemed by many a mere u&s;urpation of
this imperious prince&s;s, and had no other foundation
than a clau&s;e of a &s;tatute, re&s;toring the &s;upremacy to
the crown, and empowering the &s;overeign to appoint
commi&s;&s;ioners for exerci&s;ing that prerogative. But
prerogative in general, and e&s;pecially the &s;upremacy,
were &s;uppo&s;ed in that age to involve powers, which
no law, precedent, or rea&s;on could limit and deter|mine.</P>
<P>But
tho' the commons, in their humble petition
to the prelates, had touched &s;o gently and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively
on the eccle&s;ia&s;tical grievances, the Queen, in a &s;peech
from the throne at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, could not
forbear taking notice of their pre&s;umption, and reprov|ing
them for tho&s;e murmurs, which, for fear of offend|ing
her, they had pronounced &s;o low as not directly
to reach her royal ears. After giving them &s;ome gene|ral
thanks for their attachment to her, and making
profe&s;&s;ions of affection to her &s;ubjects, &s;he told them,

would no longer endure this licence; but meant to
guide her people, by God's rule, in the ju&s;t mean be|tween
the corruptions of Rome and the errors of mo|dern
&s;ectaries: And that as the Romani&s;ts were the in|veterate
enemies of her per&s;on, &s;o the other innovators
were dangerous to all kingly government; and under
colour of preaching the word of God, pre&s;umed to
exerci&s;e their private judgment, and to cen&s;ure the
actions of the prince<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 328. This &s;ect had indeed gone &s;o far, that a book of di&s;-|cipline was &s;ecretly &s;ub&s;cribed by above five hundred clergymen; and the pre&s;byterian government thereby e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mid&s;t of the church, not|with&s;tanding the rigour of the prelates and of the high commi&s;&s;ion.

<P>FROM the whole of this tran&s;action, we may ob&s;erve,
that the commons, in making their general application
to the prelates, as well as in &s;ome particular articles
of their petition, &s;howed them&s;elves wholly ignorant,
no le&s;s than the Queen, of the principles of liberty and
a legal con&s;titution. And it may not be unworthy of
remark, that Elizabeth, &s;o far from yielding to the
di&s;plea&s;ure of the Parliament again&s;t the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
commi&s;&s;ion, granted a new commi&s;&s;ion before the

<P>DURING this &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, there was di&s;|covered
a con&s;piracy, which much encrea&s;ed the general
animo&s;ity again&s;t the catholics, and &s;till farther widened
the breach between the religious parties. William
Parry, a catholic gentleman, had received the Queen's
pardon for a crime, by which he was expo&s;ed to capital
puni&s;hment; and having got permi&s;&s;ion to travel, he
retired to Milan, and made open profe&s;&s;ion of his re|ligion,
which he had concealed while he remained
<PB N="270" REF="297">
in England. He was here per&s;uaded by Palmio, a
je&s;uit, that he could not perform a more meritorious
action, than to take away the life of his &s;overeign and
his benefactors; the nuncio, Campeggio, when con|&s;ulted,
approved extremely of this pious undertaking;
and Parry, tho' &s;till agitated with doubts, came to
Paris, with an intention of pa&s;&s;ing over to England,
and executing his bloody purpo&s;e. He was here en|couraged
in the de&s;ign by Thomas Morgan, a gentle|man
of great credit in the party; and tho' Watts and
&s;ome other catholic prie&s;ts told him, that the enter|prize
was criminal and impious, he preferred the au|thority
of Raggazzoni, the pope's nuncio at Paris, and
determined to per&s;i&s;t in his re&s;olution. He here wrote
a letter to the pope, which was conveyed to cardinal
Como; he communicated his intention to the holy
father; and craved his ab&s;olution and paternal bene|diction.
He received an an&s;wer from the cardinal, by
which he perceived that his purpo&s;e was extremely ap|plauded;
and he came over to England with a full
de&s;ign of carrying it into execution. So deeply are
the &s;entiments of morality engraved in mens brea&s;ts,
that it is very difficult even for the prejudices of fal&s;e
religion totally to efface them; and this bigotted a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in
re&s;olved, before he came to extremity, to try every
other expedient for alleviating the per&s;ecutions, under
which the catholics at that time laboured. He found
means of being introduced to the Queen; a&s;&s;ured her
that many con&s;piracies were formed again&s;t her; and
exhorted her, as the only means of &s;aving her life,
to give the Romani&s;ts &s;ome more indulgence in the
exerci&s;e of their religion: But le&s;t he &s;hould be tempted
by the opportunity to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate her, he always came
to court unprovided of every offen&s;ive weapon. He
even procured him&s;elf to be elected member of Parlia|ment;
and having made a vehement &s;peech again&s;t the
&s;evere laws enacted this la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, was committed to
<PB N="271" REF="298">
cu&s;tody for his freedom, and &s;eque&s;tered from the hou&s;e.
His failure in the&s;e attempts confirmed him the more
in his former re&s;olution, and he communicated his
intentions to Nevil, who entered zealou&s;ly into the
de&s;ign, and was determined to have a &s;hare in the merits
of its execution. A book, newly publi&s;hed by Dr.
Allen, afterwards created a cardinal, &s;erved farther to
efface all their &s;cruples, with regard to the murder of
an heretical prince; and having agreed to &s;hoot the
Queen, while &s;he &s;hould be taking the air on hor&s;eback,
they re&s;olved, if they could not make their e&s;cape, to
&s;acrifice their lives in fulfilling a duty, &s;o agreeable, as
they imagined, to the will of God, and to true reli|gion.
But while they were watching an opportuni|ty
for the execution of their purpo&s;e, the earl of We&s;t|moreland
happened to die in exile; and as Nevil was
next heir to that family, he began to entertain hopes,
that, by doing &s;ome acceptable &s;ervice to the Queen,
he might recover the e&s;tate and honours which had been
forfeited by the rebellion of the la&s;t earl. He betrayed
the whole con&s;piracy to the mini&s;ters; and Parry,
being thrown into pri&s;on, confe&s;&s;ed the guilt, both to
them, and to the jury who tried him. The letter from
cardinal Como being produced in court, put Parry's
narrative beyond all que&s;tion, and that criminal,
having received &s;entence of death<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 103 &amp; &s;eq. Strype, vol. III. p. 255 &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>, &s;uffered the puni&s;h|ment,
which the law appointed for his trea&s;onable con|&s;piracy<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">This year, the earl of Northumberland, brother to the earl beheaded &s;ome years before, had been engaged in con&s;piracy with lord Paget for the delivery of the Queen of Scots. He was thrown into the Tower; and being con&s;cious that his guilt could be proved upon him, at lea&s;t, that &s;entence would infallibly be pronounced again&s;t him, he freed him&s;elf from farther pro&s;ecution by a voluntary death. He &s;hot him&s;elf into the brea&s;t with a pi&s;tol. About the &s;ame time, the earl of Arundel, &s;on to the unfortunate duke of Norfolk, having entered into &s;ome exceptionable mea&s;ures, and re|flecting on the unhappy fate, which had attended his family, endeavoured to depart &s;ecretly beyond &s;ea, but was di&s;covered and thrown into the Tower. In 1587 this nobleman was brought to his trial for high trea&s;on; chiefly becau&s;e he had dropped &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of affection to the Spaniards and had affirmed that he would have ma&s;&s;es &s;aid for the &s;ucce&s;s of the armada. His peers found him guilty of trea&s;on: This &s;evere &s;entence was not exe|cuted; but Arundel never recovered his liberty. He died a pri&s;oner in 1595.

THESE bloody de&s;igns now appeared every where,
as the re&s;ult of that bigotted &s;pirit by which the two
religions, e&s;pecially the catholic, were at this time actu|ated.
One Somerville, a gentleman of the county of
Warwic, &s;omewhat, di&s;ordered in his under&s;tanding,
had heard &s;o much of the merit attending the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion

betrayed his de&s;ign by &s;ome extravagances, he was
thrown into pri&s;on, and there peri&s;hed by a voluntary
death<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 495.</NOTE>. About the &s;ame time, Baltazar Gerard, a
Burgundian, undertook, and executed the &s;ame de&s;ign
again&s;t the prince of Orange;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of the Low Countries.</NOTE> and that great man peri&s;h|ed
at Delft, by the hands of a de&s;perate a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who,
with a re&s;olution worthy of a better cau&s;e, &s;acrificed
his own life in order to de&s;troy the famous re&s;torer and
protector of religious liberty. The Flemings, who
regarded that prince as their father, were filled with
infinite regret, as well when they con&s;idered the mi&s;era|ble
end of &s;o brave a patriot, as their own forlorn con|dition,
from the lo&s;s of &s;o powerful and prudent a leader,
and from the rapid progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h arms. The
prince of Parma had made every year great advances
upon them, had reduced &s;everal of the provinces to
obedience, and had laid clo&s;e frege to Antwerp, the
riche&s;t and mo&s;t populous city of the Netherlands, who&s;e
&s;ubjection, it was fore&s;een, would give a mortal blow
to the already declining affairs of the revolted States.
The only hopes which remained to them, aro&s;e from
<PB N="273" REF="300">
the pro&s;pect of foreign &s;uccours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1585.</NOTE>
Being well acquaint|ed
with the cautious and frugal maxims of Elizabeth,
they expected better &s;ucce&s;s in France; and in the
view of engaging Henry to embrace their defence,
they tendered him the &s;overeignty of their provinces.
But the pre&s;ent condition of that monarchy obliged
the King to reject &s;o advantageous an offer. The
duke of Anjou's death, which, he thought, would
have delivered him from the intrigues of that fickle and
turbulent prince, plunged him into the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s;
and the King of Navarre, a profe&s;&s;ed Hugonot, being
next heir to the crown, the duke of Gui&s;e took thence
occa&s;ion to revive the catholic league, and to urge
Henry, by the mo&s;t violent expedients, to &s;eek the ex|clu&s;ion
and &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of that brave and virtuous
prince. Henry him&s;elf, tho' a zealous catholic, yet,
becau&s;e he declined complying with their precipitate
mea&s;ures, became an object of aver&s;ion to the league;
and as his zeal in practi&s;ing all the &s;uper&s;titious ob&s;er|vances
of the Romi&s;h church, was accompanied with
a very licentious conduct in private life, the catholic
faction, in contradiction to the mo&s;t vulgar experience,
embraced thence the pretext of repre&s;enting his devoti|on
as mere hypocri&s;y, and deceit. Finding his authori|ty
to decline, he was obliged to declare war again&s;t the
Hugonots, and to put arms into the hands of the
League, whom, both on account of their dangerous
preten&s;ions at home, and their clo&s;e alliance with
Philip, he &s;ecretly regarded as his more dangerous ene|mies.
Con&s;trained by the &s;ame policy, he perceived
the danger of a&s;&s;ociating him&s;elf with the revolted pro|te&s;tants
in the Low Countries, and was obliged to re|nounce
that inviting occa&s;ion of revenging him&s;elf
for all the ho&s;tile intrigues and enterprizes of Philip.</P>
<P>The States, reduced to this extremity, &s;ent over a
&s;olemn emba&s;&s;y to London, and made offer to the
<PB N="274" REF="301">
Queen, of acknowleging her for their &s;overeign, on con|dition
of obtaining her protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Eli|zabeth's
wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;ellors were very much divided in
opinion with regard to the conduct which &s;he &s;hould
hold in this critical and important emergence. Some
advi&s;ed her to reject the offer of the States, and repre|&s;ented
the imminent dangers, as well as inju&s;tice, attend|ing
the acceptance of them. They &s;aid, that the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion
of rebellious &s;ubjects was the common cau&s;e
of all &s;overeigns, and the encouragement of a revolt in
the Flemings, might prove the example to a like perni|cious
practice in the Engli&s;h: That tho' princes were
bound by the laws of the Supreme Being, not to op|pre&s;s
their &s;ubjects, the people never were entitled to
forget all duty to their &s;overeign, or transfer, from eve|ry
fancy or di&s;gu&s;t, or even from the ju&s;te&s;t ground of
complaint, their obedience to any other ma&s;ter: That
the Queen, in the &s;uccours hitherto afforded the Fle|mings,
had con&s;idered them as labouring under oppre&s;|&s;ion,
not as entitled to freedom; and had intended on|ly
to admoni&s;h Philip not to per&s;evere in his tyranny,
without any view of ravi&s;hing from him the&s;e provin|ces,
which he enjoyed by hereditary right from his an|ce&s;tors:
That her &s;ituation in Ireland, and even in En|gland,
would afford that powerful monarch &s;ufficient
opportunity of retaliating upon her; and &s;he mu&s;t hence|forth
expect, that, in&s;tead of &s;ecretly fomenting faction,
he would openly employ his whole force in the protec|tion
and defence of the catholics. That the pope would
undoubtedly unite his &s;piritual arms to the temporal
ones of Spain; and that the Queen would &s;oon repent
her making &s;o &s;mall and precarious an aqui&s;ition in fo|reign
countries, by expo&s;ing her own dominions to &s;uch
imminent danger<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 507. Bentivoglio, part 2. lib. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="302">
OTHER coun&s;ellors of Elizabeth maintained a con|trary
opinion. They a&s;&s;erted, that the Queen had not
even from the beginning of her reign, but certainly
had not at pre&s;ent, the choice, whether &s;he would em|brace
friend&s;hip or ho&s;tility with Philip: That by the
whole tenor of that prince's conduct it appeared, that
his &s;ole aims were, the exten&s;ion of his empire, and the
utter extermination of the prote&s;tants, under the &s;pe|cious
pretence of maintaining the catholic faith: That
the provocations which &s;he had already given him,
joined to his general &s;cheme of policy, would for
ever render him her implacable enemy; and as &s;oon as
he had &s;ubdued his revolted &s;ubjects, he would undoubt|edly,
fall, with the whole force of his united empire,
on her defencele&s;s &s;tate: That the only que&s;tion was,
whether &s;he would maintain a war, abroad and &s;upport|ed
by allies, or wait till the &s;ubjection of all the con|federates
of England, &s;hould give her enemies lei&s;ure
to begin their ho&s;tilities in the bowels of that kingdom:
That the revolted provinces, tho' in a declining con|dition,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;till con&s;iderable force; and by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England, by the advantages of their &s;itua|tion,
and by their inveterate antipathy to Philip, might
&s;till be enabled to maintain the conte&s;t again&s;t the Spa|ni&s;h
monarchy: That their maritime power, united to
the Queen's, would give her entire &s;ecurity on that
&s;ide from which alone &s;he could be a&s;&s;aulted, and would
even enable her to make inroads on Philip's dominions,
both in Europe and the Indies: That a war which
was nece&s;&s;ary, could never be unju&s;t; and &s;elf-defence
was concerned, as well in warding certain dangers at a
di&s;tance, as in repelling any immediate inva&s;ion: And
that &s;ince ho&s;tility with Spain was the unavoidable
con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent intere&s;ts and &s;ituations
of the two monarchies, it was better to compen&s;ate
that danger and lo&s;s by the acqui&s;ition of &s;uch
important provinces to the Engli&s;h empire<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Camden, ibid. Betivoglio, ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="303">
AMIDST the&s;e oppo&s;ite councils, the Queen, appre|hen&s;ive
of the con&s;equences attending each extreme,
was inclined to &s;teer a middle cour&s;e; and tho' &s;uch
conduct is &s;eldom prudent, &s;he was not, in this re&s;olu|tion,
guided by any prejudice or affection. She deter|mined
not to &s;ee, without oppo&s;ition, the total ruin of
the revolted provinces, who&s;e intere&s;ts &s;he deemed &s;o
clo&s;ely connected with her own: But fore&s;eeing, that
the acceptance of their &s;overeignty would engage her
to employ her whole force in their defence, would give
umbrage to her heighbours, and would expo&s;e her to the
reproach of ambition aud u&s;urpation, imputations which
&s;he had hitherto carefully avoided, &s;he immediately re|jected
this offer. She concluded a league with the
States on the following conditions: That &s;he &s;hould
&s;end over an army to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, of five thou&s;and
foot and a thou&s;and hor&s;e, and pay them during the
war; that the general, and two others, whom &s;he &s;hould
appoint, &s;hould be admitted into the council of the
States; that neither party &s;hould make peace without
the con&s;ent of the other; that her expences &s;hould be
refunded after the conclu&s;ion of the war; and that the
towns of Flu&s;hing and the Brille, with the ca&s;tle of
Rammekins, &s;hould, in the mean time, be con&s;igned
into her hands, by way of &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>THE Queen knew that this mea&s;ure would imme|diately
engage her in open ho&s;tilities with Philip; yet
was &s;he not terrified with the view of the pre&s;ent great|ne&s;s
of that ambitious monarch. The continent of
Spain was at that time rich and populous; and the late
addition of Portugal, be&s;ides &s;ecuring internal tranquilli|ty,
had annexed an opulent kingdom to Philip's do|minions,
had made him ma&s;ter of many &s;ettlements
in the Ea&s;t-Indies, and of the whole commerce of tho&s;e
regions, and had mightily increa&s;ed his naval power,
in which he was before chiefly deficient. All the prin|ces
of Italy, even the pope and the court of Rome,
<PB N="277" REF="304">
were reduced to a kind of &s;ubjection under him, and
&s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s their &s;overeignty on very precarious
and uncertain terms. The Au&s;trian branch in Germa|ny,
with their dependant principalities, was clo&s;ely con|nected
with him, and was ready to &s;upply him with
troops for every enterprize. All the trea&s;ures of the
We&s;t-Indies were in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and the pre&s;ent
&s;carcity of the precious metals in every country of Eu|rope,
rendered the influence of his riches the more for|cible
and exten&s;ive. The Netherlands, &s;eemed on the
point of relap&s;ing into &s;ervitude; and &s;mall hopes were
entertained of their with&s;tanding tho&s;e numerous and
veteran armies which, under the command of the mo&s;t
experienced generals, he employed again&s;t them. Even
France, which was wont to counterballance the Au&s;tri|an
greatne&s;s, had lo&s;t all her force from inte&s;tine com|motions;
and as the catholics, the ruling party, were
clo&s;ely connected with him, he rather expected thence
an augmentation, than a diminution, of his power.
Upon the whole, &s;uch prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions where every where
entertained concerning the force of the Spani&s;h monar|chy,
that the King of Sweden, when he heard that
Elizabeth had openly embraced the defence of the re|volted
Flemings, &s;crupled not to &s;ay, that &s;he had now
taken the diadem from her head, and had adventured
it upon the doubtful chance of war<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 508.</NOTE>. Yet was this
prince&s;s rather cautious than enterprizing in her natue|ral
temper: She ever needed more to be impelled by
the vigour, than re&s;trained by the prudence of her mi|ni&s;ters:
But when &s;he &s;aw an evident nece&s;&s;ity, &s;he bra|ved
danger with magnanimous courage; and tru&s;ting
to her own con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, and to the affections,
however divided, of her people, &s;he prepared her&s;elf
to re&s;i&s;t, and even to a&s;&s;ault, the whole force of the ca|tholic
monarch.</P>

THE earl of Leice&s;ter was &s;ent over to Holland, at
the head of the Engli&s;h auxiliary forces. He carried
with him a &s;plendid retinue; being accompanied with
the young earl of E&s;&s;ex, his &s;on in-law, the lords Aud|ley
and North, Sir William Ru&s;&s;eil, Sir Thomas Shir|ley,
Sir Arthur Ba&s;&s;et, Sir Walter Waller, Sir Gerva&s;e
Clifton, and a &s;elect troop of five hundred gentlemen.
He was received, on his arrival at Flu&s;hing, by his ne|phew,
Sir Philip Sidney, the governor; and every
town thro' which he pa&s;&s;ed, expre&s;&s;ed their joy by ac|clamations,
and triumphal arches, as if his pre&s;ence,
and the Queen's protection, had brought them the mo&s;t
certain deliverance. The States, de&s;irous of engaging
Elizabeth &s;till farther in their defence, and knowing the
intere&s;t which Leice&s;ter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with her, conferred
on him the title of governor and captain-general of the
United provinces, appointed a guard to attend him, and
treated him, in &s;ome re&s;pects, as their &s;overeign. But
this &s;tep had a contrary effect to what they expected.
The Queen was di&s;plea&s;ed with the artifice of the States,
and the ambition of Leice&s;ter. She reprimanded both
of them very &s;everely by letters; and it was with &s;ome
difficulty, that, after many humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, they
were able to appea&s;e her.</P>
<P>AMERICA was regarded as the chief &s;ource of Phi|lip's
power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho&s;tilities with Spain.</NOTE> as well as the mo&s;t defencele&s;s part of his
dominions; and Elizabeth finding that an open breach
with that monarch was unavoidable, re&s;olved not to
leave him unmole&s;ted on that quarter. The great &s;uc|ce&s;s
of the Spaniards and Portugueze in both Indies had
excited a &s;pirit of emulation in England; and as the
&s;ucce&s;s of commerce, &s;till more of planting colonies, is
&s;low and gradual, it was happy, that a war, in this cri|tical
age, had opened a more flattering pro&s;pect to the
avarice and ambition of the Engli&s;h, and had tempted
them, by the view of &s;udden and exorbitant profit, to

Two thou&s;and three hundred volunteers, be&s;ides
&s;eamen, engaged on board of it: Sir Francis Drake was

after &s;ome more re&s;i&s;tance, and was treated in the &s;ame
manner. They burned St. Anthony and St. Helens,
two towns on the coa&s;t of Florida. Sailing along the
coa&s;t of Virginia, they found the &s;mall remains of a
colony which had been planted there by Sir Walter
Releigh, and which had gone extremely to decay. This
was the fir&s;t attempt of the Engli&s;h to form &s;uch &s;et|tlements;
and tho' they have &s;ince &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all Euro|pean
nations, both in the &s;ituation of their colonies,
and in the noble principles of liberty and indu&s;try, on
which they are founded; they had here been &s;o un&s;uc|ce&s;sful,
that the mi&s;erable planters abandoned their &s;et|tlements,
and prevailed on Drake to carry them with
him to England. He returned with &s;o much riches as
encouraged the volunteers, and with &s;uch accounts of
the Spani&s;h weakne&s;s in tho&s;e countries as &s;erved ex|tremely
to inflame the &s;pirits of the nation to future en|terprizes.
The great mortality which the climate had
produced in his fleet, was, as is u&s;ual, but a feeble re|&s;traint
on the avidity and &s;anguine hopes of young ad|ventures<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 509.</NOTE>.
It is thought that Drake's fleet fir&s;t intro|duced

<P>THE enterprizes of Leice&s;ter were much le&s;s &s;uc|ce&s;sful
than tho&s;e of Drake. This man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed nei|ther

in him by the Queen; and as he was the only bad
choice &s;he made for any con&s;iderable employment, men
naturally believed, that &s;he had here been influenced
by an affection &s;till more partial than that of friend&s;hip.
He gained at fir&s;t &s;ome advantage in an action again&s;t
the Spaniards; and threw &s;uccours into Grave, by which
that place was enabled to make a vigorous defence:
But the cawardice of the governor, Van Hemert, ren|dered
all the&s;e efforts u&s;ele&s;s. He capitulated after a
very feeble re&s;i&s;tance; and being tried for his conduct,
&s;uffered a capital puni&s;hment from the &s;entence of a
court martial. The prince of Parma next undertook
the &s;iege of Venlo, which was &s;urrendered to him, af|ter
&s;ome re&s;i&s;tance. The fate of Nuys was more di&s;|mal;
being taken by a&s;&s;ault, while the garri&s;on was
treating of a capitulation. Rhimberg, which was gar|ri&s;oned
by twelve hundred Engli&s;h, under the command
of colonel Morgan, was afterwards be&s;ieged by the Spa|niards;
and Leice&s;ter, thinking him&s;elf too weak to
attempt rai&s;ing the &s;iege, endeavoured to draw off the
prince of Parma by forming &s;ome other enterprize. He
fir&s;t attacked Doe&s;berg, and &s;ucceeded: He then &s;at
down before Zutphen, which the Spani&s;h general
thought &s;o important a place, that he ha&s;tened to its
relief. He made the marque&s;s of Gua&s;to advance with
a convoy, which he intended to throw into the place.
They were favoured by a fog; but falling by chance
on a body of Engli&s;h cavalry, a furious action en&s;ued,
in which the Spaniards were wor&s;ted, and the marque&s;s
of Gonzaga an Italian nobleman of great reputation
and family, was &s;lain. The pur&s;uit was &s;topped by
the advance of the prince of Parma with the main bo|dy
of the Spani&s;h army; and the Engli&s;h cavalry, on
their return from the field, found their advantage more
than compen&s;ated by the lo&s;s of Sir Philip Sidney, who,
being mortally wounded in the action, was carried off
by the &s;oldiers, and &s;oon after died. This per&s;on is
<PB N="281" REF="308">
de&s;cribed by the writers of that age as the mo&s;t perfect
model of an accompli&s;hed gentleman which was ever
formed even by the wanton imagination of poetry or
fiction. Virtuous conduct, polite conver&s;ation, heroic
valour, and elegant erudition, all concurred to render
him the ornament and delight of the Engli&s;h court;
and as the credit which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Queen
and the earl of Leice&s;ter, was wholly employed in
the encouragement of genius and literature, his prai&s;es
have been tran&s;mitted with advantage to po&s;terity. No
per&s;on was &s;o low as not to become an object of his hu|manity.
After this la&s;t action, while he was lying on
the field, mangled with wounds, a bottle of water was
brought him to relieve his thir&s;t; but ob&s;erving a &s;ol|dier
near him in a like mi&s;erable condition, he &s;aid,
<HI>This man's nece&s;&s;ity is &s;till greater than mine:</HI> And re&s;ign|ed
to him the bottle of water. The King of Scots,
&s;truck with admiration of Sidney's virtue, celebrated
his memory by a copy of Latin ver&s;es, which he com|po&s;ed
on occa&s;ion of the death of that young hero.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h, tho' a long peace had deprived them
of all experience, were &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of military ge|nius;
and the advantages gained by the prince of Par|ma
were not attributed to the &s;uperior bravery and di&s;|cipline
of the Spaniards, but &s;olely to the mi&s;conduct of
Leice&s;ter. The States were much di&s;contented with
his management of the war; but &s;till more with his ar|bitrary
and imperious conduct; and at the end of the
campaign, they applied to him for a redre&s;s of all the$r
grievances. But Leice&s;ter, without giving them any
&s;atisfaction, departed &s;oon after for England<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 512. Bentivoglio, part 2. lib. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen, while &s;he provoked &s;o powerful an ene|my
as the King of Spain, was not forgetful to &s;ecure
her&s;elf on the &s;ide of Scotland; and &s;he endeavoured
both to cultivate the friend&s;hip and alliance of her kin&s;|man,
<PB N="282" REF="309">
James, and to remove all grounds of quarrel be|tween
them. An attempt which &s;he had made &s;ome
time before, was not well calculated to gain the con|fidence
of that prince. She di&s;patched Wotton as her
amba&s;&s;ador to Scotland; but tho' &s;he gave him private
in&s;tructions with regard to her affairs, &s;he informed
James, that when &s;he had any political bu&s;ine&s;s to
di&s;cu&s;s with him, &s;he would employ another mini&s;ter;
that this man was not fitted for &s;erious negociations;
and that her chief purpo&s;e in &s;ending him, was to en|tertain
the King with witty and facetious conver&s;ation,
and to partake without re&s;erve of his plea&s;ures and
amu&s;ements. Wotton was ma&s;ter of profound di&s;&s;i|mulation,
and knew how to cover, under the appearance
of a carele&s;s gaiety, the deepe&s;t de&s;igns, and mo&s;t dan|gerous
artifices. When but a youth of twenty, he had
been employed by his uncle, Dr. Wotton, amba&s;|&s;ador
in France during the reign of Mary, to en&s;nare
the con&s;table, Montmorency; and had not his purpo&s;e
been fru&s;trated by pure accident, his cunning had
prevailed over all the caution and experience of that
aged mini&s;ter. It is no wonder, that, after years had
&s;o much improved him in all arts of deceit, he &s;hould
gain an a&s;cendant over a young prince, of &s;o open and
unguarded a temper as James, e&s;pecially when the
Queen's recommendation prepared the way for his ar|tifices.
He was admitted into all the plea&s;ures of the
King; made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his &s;ecrets; and had &s;o
much the more authority with him in political tran&s;|actions,
as he did not &s;eem to pay the lea&s;t attention
or regard to the&s;e matters. The Scots mini&s;ters,
who ob&s;erved the growing intere&s;t of this man,
endeavoured to acquire his friend&s;hip; and &s;crupled
not to &s;acrifice to his intrigues the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial
intere&s;ts of their ma&s;ter. Elizabeth's u&s;ual jea|lou&s;ies
<PB N="283" REF="310">
with regard to her heirs began now to be level|led
again&s;t James; and as that prince had attained the
years proper for marriage, &s;he was apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t,
by being &s;trengthened with children and alliances, he
&s;hould acquire the greater intere&s;t and authority with
her Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. She directed Wotton to form a
&s;ecret concert with &s;ome Scots noblemen, and to pro|cure
their promi&s;e, that James, during three years,
&s;hould not, on any account, be permitted to marry.
In con&s;equence of this view, they endeavoured to
embroil him with the King of Denmark, who had &s;ent
amba&s;&s;adors to Scotland, on pretence of demanding the
re&s;titution of the Orkneys, but really with a view of
opening a propo&s;al of marriage between James and his
daughter. Wotton is &s;aid to have employed his in|trigues
to purpo&s;es &s;till more dangerous. He formed
a con&s;piracy with &s;ome malecontents, to &s;eize the per|&s;on
of the King, and to deliver him into the hands of
Elizabeth, who would probably have denied all con|currence
in the de&s;ign, but who would have been care|ful
to retain him in perpetual thraldom, if not capti|vity.
The con&s;piracy was di&s;covered, and Wotton fled
ha&s;tily from Scotland, without taking leave of the
King<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Melvil.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JAMES'S &s;ituation obliged him to di&s;&s;emble his re|&s;entment
of this traiterous attempt, and his natural
temper inclined him &s;oon to forgive and forget it. The
Queen found no difficulty to renew the negotiations
for a &s;trict alliance between Scotland and England;
and the more effectually to gain the prince's affections,
&s;he granted him a pen&s;ion, equivalent to his claim on
the inheritance of his grandmother the counte&s;s of
Lenox, lately decea&s;ed<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 351.</NOTE>. A league was formed be|tween
Elizabeth and James, for the mutual defence of
their dominions, and of their religion, now menaced
<PB N="284" REF="311">
by the open combination of all the catholic powers
of Europe. It was &s;tipulated, that if Elizabeth was
invaded, James &s;hould aid her with a body of two
thou&s;and hor&s;e and five thou&s;and foot; that Elizabeth,
in a like ca&s;e, &s;hould &s;end to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance three thou|&s;and
hor&s;e and &s;ix thou&s;and foot; that the charge
of the&s;e armies &s;hould be defrayed by the prince who
demanded a&s;&s;i&s;tance; that if the inva&s;ion &s;hould be
made upon England, within &s;ixty miles of the fron|tiers
of Scotland, this latter kingdom &s;hould march
its whole force to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the former; and that
the pre&s;ent league &s;hould &s;uper&s;ede all former alliances
of either &s;tate with any foreign kingdom, &s;o far as re|ligion
was concerned<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 349. Camden, p. 513. Rymer, tom. XV. p. 803.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this league James &s;ecured him&s;elf again&s;t all at|tempts
from abroad, opened a way for acquiring the
confidence and affection of the Engli&s;h, and might en|tertain
&s;ome pro&s;pect of dome&s;tic tranquillity, which,
&s;o long as he lived on bad terms with Elizabeth, he
could never expect long to enjoy. Be&s;ides the tur|bulent
di&s;po&s;ition, and inveterate feuds of the nobi|lity,
ancient maladies of the Scots government, the
&s;pirit of fanatici&s;m had introduced a new di&s;order; &s;o
much the more dangerous, as religion, when corrupted
by fal&s;e opinion, is not re&s;trained by any rules of mo|rality,
and is even &s;carcely to be accounted for in its
operations, by any principles of ordinary conduct and
policy. The in&s;olence of the Scots preachers, who
triumphed in their dominion over the populace, had,
at this time, reached an extreme height; and they
carried their arrogance &s;o far, not only again&s;t the
King, but again&s;t the Parliament, and the whole civil
power, that they dared to excommunicate the archbi|&s;hop
of St. Andrews, becau&s;e he had been active for
promoting a law which re&s;trained their &s;editious &s;er|mons<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 345, 346.</NOTE>:
<PB N="285" REF="312">
Nor could that prelate &s;ave him&s;elf any way
from this terrible &s;entence, but by renouncing all pre|ten&s;ions
to eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority. One Gib&s;on &s;aid
in the pulpit, that captain James Stuart (meaning the
late earl of Arran) and his wife, Jezabel, had been
deemed the chief per&s;ecutors of the church; but it was
now &s;een, that the King him&s;elf was the great offender:
And for this crime the preacher denounced again&s;t him,
the cur&s;e which fell on Jeroboam, that he &s;hould die
childle&s;s, and be the la&s;t of his race<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ecretary, perceiving the King &s;o much mo|le&s;ted
with eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and with the refractory
di&s;po&s;ition of the clergy, advi&s;ed him to leave them to
their own cour&s;es: For that in a &s;hort time they would
become &s;o intolerable, that the people would ri&s;e
again&s;t them, and chace them out of the country.
&startq;True,&endq; replied the King: &startq;If I purpo&s;ed to undo
the church and religion, your coun&s;el were good:
But my intention is to maintain both; therefore
cannot I &s;uffer the clergy to follow &s;uch a conduct,

jealou&s;y and politics, rather than of friend&s;hip or gene|ro&s;ity:
Re&s;entment of this u&s;age had pu&s;hed Mary into
enterprizes, which had very nearly threatned the re|po&s;e
and authority of Elizabeth: The rigour and re|&s;traint,
which were thence redoubled upon the captive
Queen<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 139. Haynes, p. 607.</NOTE>, &s;till impelled her to attempt greater ex|tremities;
and while her impatience of confinement,
her revenge<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mary's extreme animo&s;ity again&s;t Elizabeth may ea&s;ily be conceived, and broke out, about this time, in an incident, which may appear curious. While the former Queen was kept in cu&s;tody by the earl of Shrew&s;bury, &s;he lived during a long time in great intimacy with the counte&s;s; but that lady ente$$aining jealou&s;y of an armour between her and the earl, their friend&s;hip was converted into enmity; and Mary took a method of revenge, which as once gratified her &s;pite again&s;t the counte&s;s and that again&s;t Eli|zabeth. She wrote to the Queen informing her of all the malicious &s;can|dalous &s;tories, which, &s;he &s;aid, the counte&s;s of Shrew&s;bury had reported of her: That Elizabeth had given a promi&s;e of marriage to a certain per|&s;on, whom &s;he afterwards often admitted to her bed: That &s;he had been equally indulgent to Simier, the French agent, and to the duke of Anjou$: That Hatton was al&s;o one of her paramours, who was even di&s;gu&s;ted with her exce&s;&s;ive love and fondne&s;s: That tho' &s;he was on other occa&s;ions avaritious to the la&s;t degree, as well as ungrateful, and kind to very few, &s;he &s;pared no expence in gratifying her amorous pa&s;&s;ions: That notwith|&s;tanding her licentious amours, &s;he was not made like other women; and all tho&s;e who courted her marriage would in the end be di&s;appointed: That &s;he was &s;o conceited of her beauty, as to &s;wallow the mo&s;t extrava|gant flattery from her courtiers, who could not, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, for|bear even &s;neering at her for her folly: That it was u&s;ual for them to tell her, that the lu&s;tre of her beauty dazled them like that of the &s;un, and they could not behold it with a fixed eye: She added, that the counte&s;s had &s;aid, that Mary's be&s;t policy would be to engage her &s;on to make love to the Queen; nor was there any danger that &s;uch a propo&s;al would be taken for mockery; &s;o ridiculous was the opinion which &s;he had enter|tained of her own charms. She pretended, that the counte&s;s had repre|&s;ented her as no le&s;s odious in her temper than profligate in her manners, and ab&s;urd in her vanity: That &s;he had &s;o beaten a young woman of the name of Scudamore as to break that lady's finger; and in order to cover over the matter, it was pretended, that the accident had proceeded from the the fall of a candle&s;tick: That &s;he had cut another acro&s;s the hand with a knife, who had been &s;o unfortunate as to offend her. Mary added, that the counte&s;s had informed her, that Elizabeth had &s;ubordned Rol&s;tone to pretend friend&s;hip to her, in order to debauch her, and thereby throw in|famy on her rival. See Murden's State Papers, p. 558. This imprudent and malicious letter was wrote a very little before the detection of Queen Mary's con&s;piracy; and contributed, no doubt, to render the proceedings again&s;t her more rigorous. How far all the&s;e imputations again&s;t Elizabeth can be credited, may perhaps appear doubtful: But her extreme fondne&s;s for Leice&s;ter, Hatton, and E&s;&s;ex, not to mention Moun$joy and others, with the curious pa&s;&s;ages between her and admiral Seymour, contained in Haynes, render her cha&s;tity very &s;u&s;picious. Her &s;elf-conceit with regard to beauty, we know from other undoubted authority, to have been extravagant. Even when &s;he was a very old woman, &s;he allowed her courtiers to flatter her with regard to her <HI>excellent beauties.</HI> Birch, vol. II. p. 442, 443. Her pa&s;&s;ionate temper may al&s;o be proved from many lively in&s;tances; and it was not unu&s;ual with her to beat her maids of honour. See the Sydney Papers, vol. II. p. 38. The blow &s;he gave to E&s;&s;ex before the privy council is another in&s;tance. Had this Queen been born in a private &s;tation, &s;he would not have been very amiable: But her ab&s;olute authority, at the &s;ame time that it gave an uncontroled &s;wing to her violent pa&s;&s;ions, enabled her to compen&s;ate for her infirmities by many great and &s;ignal virtues.</NOTE>, and her high &s;pirit concurred with re|ligious
<PB N="287" REF="316">
zeal, and the &s;ugge&s;tions of de&s;perate bigots,
&s;he was at la&s;t engaged in de&s;igns, which afforded

THE Engli&s;h &s;eminary at Rheims had wrought them|&s;elves
up to a high pitch of rage and animo&s;ity again&s;t
the Queen. The recent per&s;ecutions, from which they
had e&s;caped:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal of the catholics.</NOTE> The new rigours, which, they knew,
awaited them in the cour&s;e of their mi&s;&s;ions: The li|berty
which for the pre&s;ent they enjoyed of declaiming
again&s;t that prince&s;s: And the contagion of religious
fury, which every where &s;urrounded them in France:
All the&s;e cau&s;es had obliterated with them every max|im
of common &s;en&s;e, and every principle of morals or
humanity. Intoxicated with admiration of the omni|potence
and infallibilit, of the pope, they revered his
bull by which he excommunicated and depo&s;ed the
Queen; and &s;ome of them had gone to that height of
extravagance, as to a&s;&s;ert, that that performance had
been immediately dictated by the Holy Gho&s;t. The
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of heretical &s;overeigns, and of that prince&s;s in
particular, was repre&s;ented as the mo&s;t meritorious of all
enterprizes; and they taught, that whoever peri&s;hed in
&s;uch pious attempts enjoyed without di&s;pute the glorious
and never-fading crown of martyrdom. By &s;uch doc|trines,
they in&s;tigated John Savage, a man of de&s;perate
courage, who had &s;erved &s;ome years in the Low Coun|tries,
under the prince of Parma, to attempt the life of
Elizabeth; and this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, having made a vow to per|&s;evere

ABOUT the &s;ame time, John Ballard, a prie&s;t of that
&s;eminary, had returned to Paris from his mi&s;&s;ion in
England and Scotland; and as he had di&s;covered a
&s;pirit of mutiny and rebellion to be very prevalent
among the catholic devotees in the&s;e countries, he had
founded on that di&s;po&s;ition the project of dethroning
Elizabeth, and of re&s;toring by force of arms the exerci&s;e
of the antient religion in England<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Murden's State Papers, p. 517.</NOTE>. The &s;ituation
of affairs abroad &s;eemed favourable to this enterprize:
The pope, the Spaniard, the duke of Gui&s;e, the prince,
created by the pope duke, of Parma, concurring in in|tere&s;ts,
had formed a re&s;olution to make &s;ome attempt
upon the Queen: And Mendoza, the Spani&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador
at Paris, &s;trongly encouraged Ballard to hope
for &s;uccours from the&s;e princes. Charles Paget alone,
a zealous catholic and a devoted partizan of the Queen
of Scots, being well acquainted with the prudence,
vigour, and general popularity of Elizabeth, always
maintained, that &s;o long as that prince&s;s was allowed
to live, it was in vain to expect any &s;ucce&s;s from an
enterprize upon England. Ballard, per&s;uaded of this
truth, &s;aw more clearly the nece&s;&s;ity of executing the
de&s;ign, formed at Rheims: He came over to England
in the di&s;gui&s;e of a &s;oldier, and a&s;&s;umed the name of
captain forte&s;cue: And he bent his endeavours to
effectuate at once the project of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, an in|&s;urrection

Anthony Babington of Dethic in the county of Derby.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Babington's con&s;piracy.</NOTE>

<PB N="290" REF="319">
and with the bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, Mary's am|ba&s;&s;ador
to the court of France. By continually
extolling the amiable accompli&s;hments and hero|ical
virtues of that prince&s;s, they inflamed the
unguarded mind of young Babington to make
$$me attempt for her &s;ervice; and they employed
every principle of ambition, gallantry, and religious
zeal to give him a contempt of tho&s;e dangers, which
attended any enterprize again&s;t the vigilant govern|ment
of Elizabeth. Finding him well di&s;po&s;ed for
their purpo&s;e, they &s;ent him back to England, and
&s;ecretly, unknown to him&s;elf, recommended him to
the Queen of Scots as a per&s;on worth engaging in her
&s;ervice. She wrote him a letter, full of friend&s;hip and
confidence; and Babington, &s;anguine in his temper
and zealousin his principles, thought, that the&s;e advan|ces
now bound him in honour to devote him&s;elf entire|ly
to the &s;ervice of that unfortunate princes. During
&s;ome time, he had found means of conveying to her
all her foreign corre&s;pondence; but after &s;he was put
under the cu&s;tody of Sir Amias Paulet, and reduced
to a more rigorous confinement, he experienced &s;o
much difficulty and danger in rendering her this &s;ervice,
that he had de&s;i&s;ted from every attempt of that nature.</P>
<P>WHEN Ballard began to open his intentions to
Babington, he found his zeal &s;u&s;pended, not extin|gui&s;hed:
His former ardour revived on the mention of
any enterprize, which &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s in the
cau&s;e of Mary or of the catholic religion. He had
entertained &s;entiments conformable to tho&s;e of Paget,
and repre&s;ented the folly of all attempts, which, during
the life-time of Elizabeth, could be formed again&s;t
the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion and government of England.
Ballard, encouraged by this hint, proceeded to di&s;|cover
to him the de&s;ign undertaken by Savage<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. State Trials, p. 114.</NOTE>;
and was plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that, in&s;tead of being
&s;hocked with that project, Babington only thought it not
<PB N="291" REF="320">
&s;ecure enough, when entru&s;ted to one &s;ingle hand, and
propo&s;ed to join four others with Savage in this de&s;pe|rate
and bloody enterprize.</P>
<P>IN pro&s;ecution of the&s;e views, Babington employed
him&s;elf in encrea&s;ing then umber of his a&s;&s;ociates; and he
&s;ecretly drew into the con&s;piracy many catholic gen|tlemen,
di&s;contented with the pre&s;ent government.
Barnwel, of a noble family in Ireland, Charnoc,
a gentleman of Lanca&s;hire, and Abbington, who&s;e
father had been cofferer to the hou&s;hould, readily un|dertook
the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the Queen. Charles Tilney
the heir of a very antient family, and Titchborne
of Southampton, when the de&s;ign was propo&s;ed to
them, expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;cruples, which were at la&s;t re|moved
by the arguments of Babington and Ballard.
Savage alone refu&s;ed for &s;ome time to &s;hare the
glory of the enterprize with any others<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 111.</NOTE>; he chal|lenged
the whole to him&s;elf; and it was with &s;ome
difficulty he was induced to depart from this prepo&s;te|rous
ambition.</P>
<P>THE delivery of the Queen of Scots, at the very
&s;ame in&s;tant, when Elizabeth &s;hould be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated,
was requi&s;ite for effecting the purpo&s;e of the con&s;pirators;
and Babington undertook, with a party of an hundred
hor&s;e, to attack her guards, while &s;he &s;hould be taking
the air on hor&s;eback. In this enterprize, he engaged
Edward Wind&s;or, brother to the lord of that name,
Thomas Sali&s;bury, Robert Gage, John Travers, John
Jones, and Henry Donne; mo&s;t of them men of family
and intere&s;t. The con&s;pirators much wanted, but
could not find, any nobleman of name, whom they
might place at the head of their enterprize; but they
tru&s;ted, that the great events, of the Queen's death
and Mary's delivery, would rouze all the zealous
catholics to arms; and that foreign forces, taking
advantage of the general confu&s;ion, would ea&s;ily fix
<PB N="292" REF="321">
the Queen of Scots on the throne, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the
antient religion.</P>
<P>THESE de&s;perate projects had not e&s;caped the vigi|lance
of Elizabeth's council, particularly of Wal&s;ing|ham,
&s;ecretary of &s;tate. That artful mini&s;ter had en|gaged
Maud, a catholic prie&s;t, whom he retained in
pay, to attend Ballard in his journey to France, and
had thereby got a hint of the de&s;igns, entertained by
the fugitives. Polly, another of his &s;pies, had found
means to in&s;inuate him&s;elf among the con&s;pirators
in England; and tho' not entirely tru&s;ted, had obtained
&s;ome in&s;ight into their dangerous &s;ecrets. But the bot|tom
of the con&s;piracy was never fully known, till
Gifford, a &s;eminary prie&s;t, came over, and made a
tender of his &s;ervice to Wal&s;ingham. By his means,
the di&s;covery became of the utmo&s;t importance, and
involved the fate of Mary, as well as of tho&s;e zealous
partizans of that prince&s;s.</P>
<P>BABINGTON and his a&s;&s;ociates, having laid &s;uch
a &s;cheme, as, they thought, promi&s;ed infallible &s;ucce&s;s,
were impatient to communicate the de&s;ign to the
Queen of Scots, and to obtain her approbation and
concurrence. For this &s;ervice, they employed Gifford,
who immediately applied to Wal&s;ingham, that the in|tere&s;t
of that mini&s;ter might forward his &s;ecret corre&s;pon|dence
with Mary. Wal&s;ingham propo&s;ed the matter
to Paulet, and de&s;ired him to connive at Gifford's cor|rupting
one of his &s;ervants: But Paulet was aver&s;e to
the introducing &s;uch a pernicious precedent into his
family, and de&s;ired, that they would rather think of
&s;ome other expedient. Gifford found a brewer, who
&s;upplied the family with ale; and bribed him to con|vey
letters to the captive Queen. The letters,
by Paulet's connivance, were thru&s;t thro' a chink in
the wall; and an&s;wers were returned by the &s;ame con|veyance.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="322">
BALLARD and Babington were at fir&s;t diffident of
Gifford's fidelity; and to make trial of him, they gave
him only blank papers made up like letters: But find|ing
by the an&s;wers, that the&s;e had been faithfully deli|vered,
they laid a&s;ide all farther &s;cruple, and conveyed
by his hands the mo&s;t criminal and dangerous parts
of their con&s;piracy. Babington informed Mary of the
de&s;ign laid for a foreign inva&s;ion, the plan of an in|&s;urrection
at home, the &s;cheme for her delivery, and
the con&s;piracy for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the u&s;urper, by &s;ix noble
gentlemen, as he termed them, all of them his private
friends, who, from the zeal, which they bore to the
catholic cau&s;e and her maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, would un|dertake
the <HI>tragical execution.</HI> Mary replied, that &s;he
approved highly of the de&s;ign, that the gentlemen might
expect all the rewards, which it &s;hould ever be in her
power to confer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary a&s;&s;ents to the con|&s;piracy.</NOTE> and that the death of Elizabeth was
a nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tance, before any attempts were
made either for her own delivery or an in&s;urrection<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 135. Camden, p. 515.</NOTE>.
The&s;e letters, with others to Mendoza, Charles Paget,
the archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, and Sir Francis Ingel|field,
were carrield by Gifford to &s;ecretary Wal&s;ing|ham;
were decyphered by the art of Philips, his clerk;
and copies taken of them. Wal&s;ingliam employed a
new artifice, in order to obtain full in&s;ight into the
plot: He &s;ubjoined to a letter of Mary's a po&s;t&s;cript
in the &s;ame cypher; in which he made her de&s;ire
Babington to inform her of the names of the &s;ix con|&s;pirators.
The indi&s;cretion of Babington furni&s;hed
Wal&s;ingham with &s;till another means of detection as
well as of defence. That gentleman had made a picture
be drawn, where he him&s;elf was repre&s;ented &s;tanding
amid&s;t the &s;ix a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; and a motto was &s;ubjoined,
expre&s;&s;ing, that their common perils were the band
of their confederacy. A copy of this picture was
brought to Elizabeth, that &s;he might know the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in
<PB N="294" REF="323">
and guard her&s;elf again&s;t their approach to her per|&s;on.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, Babington, anxious to en&s;ure and
ha&s;ten the foreign &s;uccours, re&s;olved to di&s;patch Bal|lard
into France; and he procured for him, under
a feigned name, a licence to travel. In order to re|move
from him&s;elf all &s;u&s;picion, he applied to Wal|&s;ingham,
pretended great zeal for the Queen's &s;ervice,
offered to go abroad, and promi&s;ed to employ that
confidence, which he had gained among the catholics,
to the detection and di&s;appointment of their con|&s;piracies.
Wal&s;ingham commended his loyal purpo&s;es;
and promi&s;ing his own council and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the
execution of them, &s;till fed him with hopes, and
maintained a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with him. A war|rant,
meanwhile, was i&s;&s;ued for &s;eizing Ballard; and
this incident joined to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, begot
in all the con&s;pirators the utmo&s;t anxiety and concern.
Some advi&s;ed that they &s;hould immediately make their
e&s;cape: Others propo&s;ed, that Savage and Charnoc
&s;hould without delay execute their purpo&s;e again&s;t
Elizabeth; and Babington, in pro&s;ecution of this
&s;cheme, furni&s;hed Savage with money, that he might
buy good cloaths, and have thereby the more ea&s;y ac|ce&s;s
to the Queen's per&s;on. Next day, they began to
apprehend, that they had taken the alarm too ha&s;tily;
and Babington, having renewed his corre&s;pondence
with Wal&s;ingham, was per&s;uaded by that &s;ubtle mini|&s;ter,
that the &s;eizure of Ballard had proceeded entirely
from the u&s;ual diligence of informers in the detection
of popi&s;h and &s;eminary prie&s;ts. He even con&s;ented to
take &s;ecretly lodgings in Wal&s;ingham's hou&s;e, that they
might have more frequent conferences together, before
his intended departure for France: But ob&s;erving, that
he was watched and guarded, he made his e&s;pcape,
and gave the alarm to the other con&s;pirators. They
all took to flight, covered them&s;elves with &s;everal di&s;|gui&s;es,
<PB N="295" REF="324">
and lay concealed in woods or barns; but
were &s;oon di&s;covered and thrown into pri&s;on. In their
examinations, they contradicted each other; and the
leaders were obliged to make a full confe&s;&s;ion of the
truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con&s;pi|rators &s;eized and execut|ed.</NOTE> Fourteen were condemned and executed: Of
whom, &s;even acknowleged the crime on their trial; the
re&s;t were convicted by evidence.</P>
<P>THE le&s;&s;er con&s;pirators being di&s;patched,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> mea&s;ures
were taken for the trial and conviction of the Queen
of Scots; on who&s;e account, and by who&s;e concur|rence,
all the&s;e attempts had been made again&s;t the
life of the Queen, and the tranquillity of the kingdom.
Some of Elizabeth's coun&s;ellors were aver&s;e to this
procedure; and thought, that the clo&s;e confinement
of a woman, who was become very &s;ickly, and who
would probably put a &s;peedy end to their anxiety by
her natural death, might give &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to the
government, without attempting a mea&s;ure of which
there &s;carcely remains any example in hi&s;tory. Lei|ce&s;ter
advi&s;ed, that Mary &s;hould be &s;ecretly di&s;patched
by poi&s;on; and he &s;ent a divine to convince Wal&s;ingham
of the lawfulne&s;s of that action: But Wal&s;ingham decla|red
his abhorrence of it; and in&s;i&s;ted &s;till, in conjunction
with the majority of the coun&s;ellors, for the open trial
of the Queen of Scots. The &s;ituation of England,
and of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters had, indeed, been hitherto
not a little dangerous. No &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the crown was
declared; but the heir of blood, to whom the people
in general were likely to adhere, was, by education,
an enemy to the national religion; was, from mul|tiplied
injuries, an enemy to the mini&s;ters and princi|pal
nobility: And their per&s;onal &s;afety, as well as the
&s;ecurity of the government, &s;eemed to hang alone on
the Queen's life, who was now &s;omewhat advanced in
years. No wonder, therefore, that Elizabeth's coun|&s;ellors
knowing them&s;elves to be &s;o obnoxious to the
Queen of Scots, endeavoured to pu&s;h every mea&s;ure to
<PB N="296" REF="325">
extremity again&s;t her; and were even more anxious
than the Queen her&s;elf, to prevent her from ever mount|ing
the throne of England.</P>
<P>THO' all England was acquainted with the detec|tion
of Babington's con&s;piracy, every avenue to the
Queen of Scots was &s;o &s;trictly guarded, that &s;he re|mained
in utter ignorance of the whole matter; and it
was a great &s;urprize to her, when Sir Thomas Gorges,
by Elizabeth's orders, informed her, that all her ac|complices
were di&s;covered and arre&s;ted. He cho&s;e the
time for giving her this intelligence, when &s;he was
mounted on hor&s;eback to go a hunting; and &s;he was
not permitted to return to her former place of abode,
but was conducted from one gentleman's hou&s;e to
another, till &s;he was lodged in Fotheringay ca&s;tle in
the country of Northampton, which it was determined
to make the la&s;t &s;tage of her trial and &s;ufferings. Her
two &s;ecretaries, Nau, a Frenchman, and Curle, a
Scot, were immediately arre&s;ted: All her papers were
&s;eized, and &s;ent up to the council: Above &s;ixty differ|ent
keys to cyphers were di&s;covered: There were
al&s;o found many letters from per&s;ons beyond &s;ea; and
&s;everal too from Engli&s;h noblemen, containing ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of re&s;pect and attachment. The Queen took
no notice of this la&s;t di&s;covery; but the per&s;ons them|&s;elves,
knowing their corre&s;pondence to be detected,
thought that they had no other method of making
atonement for their imprudence, than declaring them|&s;elves
thenceforth the mo&s;t inveterate enemies to the
Queen of Scots<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 518.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I$ was re&s;olved to try Mary not by the common
&s;tatutes of trea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;olution to try the Queen of Scots.</NOTE> but by the act which had pa&s;&s;ed
the former year, with a view to this very event;
and the Queen, in terms of that act, appointed a
commi&s;&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of forty noblemen and privy|coun&s;ellors,
and empowered them to examine and pa&s;s
<PB N="297" REF="326">
&s;entence on Mary, whom &s;he denominated the late
Queen of Scots, and heir to James the fifth of Scot|land.
The commi&s;&s;ioners came to Fotheringay ca&s;tle,
and &s;ent to her Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir Amias Paulet,
and Edward Barker, who delivered her a letter
from Elizabeth informing her of the commi&s;|&s;ion,
and of the approaching trial. Mary receiv|ed
the intelligence without any emotion or a&s;toni&s;h|ment.
She &s;aid, however, that it &s;eemed &s;trange to
her that the Queen &s;hould command her, as a &s;ubject,
to &s;ubmit to a trial and examination before &s;ubjects:
That &s;he was an ab&s;olute independant prince&s;s, and
would yield to nothing which might derogate either
from her royal maje&s;ty, from the &s;tate of &s;overeign
princes, or from the dignity and rank of her &s;on:
That, however oppre&s;&s;ed by misfortunes and calami|ties,
her &s;pirits were not yet &s;o much broke, as her
enemies flattered them&s;elves; nor would &s;he, on any
account, be acce&s;&s;ary to her own degradation and
di&s;honour: That &s;he was ignorant of the laws and
&s;tatutes of England; was utterly de&s;titute of council;
and could not conceive who were intitled to be called
her peers, or could legally &s;it as judges on her trial:
That tho' &s;he had lived in England for many years,
&s;he had lived in captivity; and not having received the
protection of the laws, &s;he could not, merely by her
involuntary re&s;idence in the country, be &s;uppo&s;ed to
have &s;ubjected her&s;elf to their juri&s;diction and authori|ty:
That notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperiority of her rank,
&s;he was willing to give an account of her conduct
before an Engli&s;h Parliament; but could not view
the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners in any other light, than as men
appointed to ju&s;tify, by &s;ome colour of legal proceeding,
her condemnation and execution: And that &s;he warn|ed
them to look to their con&s;cience and their charac|ter,
in trying an innocent per&s;on; and to reflect,
that the&s;e tran&s;actions would &s;omewhere be &s;ubject to
<PB N="298" REF="327">
revi&s;ion, and that the theatre of the whole world was
much wider than the kingdom of England.</P>
<P>IN return, the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent a new deputation,
informing her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com|mi&s;&s;ioners prevail on her to &s;ub|mit to the trial.</NOTE> that her plea, either from her royal
dignity or from her impri&s;onment, could not be ad|mitted;
and that they were empowered to proceed
again&s;t her, even tho' &s;he &s;hould refu&s;e to appear
before them. Burleigh, the trea&s;urer, and Bromley,
the chancellor, employed much rea&s;oning to make her
&s;ubmit to the trial; but the per&s;on who&s;e arguments
had the chief influence, was Sir Chri&s;topher Hatton,
vice-chamberlain. His &s;peech was to this purpo&s;e.
&startq;You are accu&s;ed, Madam,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;but not
condemned, of having con&s;pired the de&s;truction of
our Lady and Queen anointed. You &s;ay, you are
a Queen: But, in &s;uch a crime as this, and &s;uch
a &s;ituation as yours, the royal dignity it&s;elf, neither
by the civil nor canon law, nor by the law of nature
or or nations, is exempt from judgment. If you
be innocent, you wrong your reputation in avoid|ing
a trial. We have been pre&s;ent at your pro|te&s;tations
of innocence; but Queen Elizabeth thinks
otherwi&s;e; and is heartily &s;orry for the appearances
which lie again&s;t you. To examine, therefore,
your cau&s;e, &s;he has appointed commi&s;&s;ioners, honou|rable
per&s;ons, prudent and upright men, who are
ready to hear you with equity, and even with favour,
and will rejoice if you can clear your&s;elf of the
imputations which have been thrown upon you.
Believe me, Madam, the Queen her&s;elf will rejoice,
who affirmed to me at my departure, that nothing
which ever befel her, had given her &s;o much&punc; unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
as that you &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of a concur|rence
in the&s;e criminal enterprizes. Laying a&s;ide,
therefore, the fruitle&s;s claim of privilege from your
royal dignity, which can now avail you nothing,
tru&s;t to the better defence of your innocence, make
<PB N="299" REF="328">
it appear in open trial, and leave not upon your
memory that &s;tain of infamy which mu&s;t attend your
ob&s;tinate &s;ilence on this occa&s;ion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 523.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>BY this artful &s;peech, Mary was per&s;uaded to appear
before the court; and thereby gave an appearance of
legal procedure to the trial, and prevented tho&s;e dif|ficulties,
which the commi&s;&s;ioners mu&s;t have fallen
into, had &s;he per&s;evered in maintaining &s;o &s;pecious a
plea as that of $word$ &s;overeign and independant character.
Her conduct in this particular mu&s;t be regarded as the
more imprudent, becau&s;e formerly, when Elizabeth's
commi&s;&s;ioners pretended not to exerci&s;e any juri&s;dicti|on
over her, and only entered into her cau&s;e by her
own con&s;ent and approbation, &s;he declined ju&s;tifying
her&s;elf, when her honour, which ought to have
been dearer to her than life, &s;eemed ab&s;olutely to re|quire
it.</P>
<P>ON her fir&s;t appearance before the commi&s;&s;ioners,
Mary, either &s;en&s;ible of her imprudence, or &s;till un|willing
to degrade her&s;elf by &s;ubmitting to a trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The trial.</NOTE> re|newed
her prote&s;tation again&s;t the authority of
her judges: The chancellor an&s;wered her by plead|ing
the &s;upreme authority of the Engli&s;h laws over
every one who re&s;ided in England: And the com|mi&s;&s;ioners
accommodated matters, by ordering both her
prote&s;tation and his an&s;wer to be recorded.</P>
<P>THE lawyers of the crown then opened the charge
again&s;t the Queen of Scots. They proved, by inter|cepted
letters, that &s;he had allowed cardinal Allen and
others to treat her as Queen of England; and that &s;he
had kept a corre&s;pondence with lord Paget and Charles
Paget, in a view of engaging the Spaniards to invade
the kingdom. Mary &s;eemed not anxious to clear
her&s;elf from either of the&s;e imputations. She only
&s;aid, that &s;he could not hinder others from u&s;ing what
<PB N="300" REF="329">
&s;tyle they plea&s;ed in writing to her; and that it was
lawful for her to try every expedient for the recovery
of her liberty.</P>
<P>AN intercepted letter of her's to Mendoza was next
produced; in which &s;he promi&s;ed to transfer to Philip
her right to the kingdom of England, if her &s;on &s;hould
refu&s;e to be converted to the catholic faith; an event,
&s;he &s;aid, of which there was no expectation, while
he remained in the hands of his Scots &s;ubjects<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 138.</NOTE>.
Even this part of the charge, &s;he took no pains to
deny, or rather &s;he &s;eemed to acknowlege it. She
&s;aid, that &s;he had no kingdoms to di&s;po&s;e of; yet was
it lawful for her to give at her plea&s;ure what was her
own, and &s;he was not accountable to any for her
actions. She added, that &s;he had formerly rejected
that propo&s;al from Spain, but now, &s;ince all her hopes
in England were gone, &s;he was fully determined not
to refu&s;e foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance. There was al&s;o produced
evidence to prove, that Allen and Par&s;ons were at that
very time negotiating by her orders in Rome the con|ditions
of transferring her Engli&s;h crown to the
King of Spain, and of di&s;inheriting her heretical
&s;on<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 525. This evidence was that of Curle, her &s;ecretary, whom &s;he allowed to be a very hone&s;t man; and who, as well as Nau, had given proofs of his integrity, by keeping &s;o long &s;uch important &s;ecrets, from who&s;e di&s;covery he could have reaped the greate&s;t profit. Mary, after all, thought that &s;he had &s;o little rea&s;on to complain of Curle's evidence, that &s;he took care to have him paid a con&s;iderable &s;um by her te&s;tament, which &s;he wrote the day before her death. Goodal, vol. I. p. 413. Neither did &s;he forget Nau, tho' le&s;s &s;atisfied with his conduct. Id. ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that Mary's prejudices again&s;t
her &s;on were, at this time, carried &s;o far, that &s;he
had even entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t him, had
appointed lord Claude Hamilton regent of Scotland,
and had in&s;tigated her adherents to &s;eize James's per|&s;on
<PB N="301" REF="330">
and deliver him into the hands of the pope or the
King of Spain; whence he was never to be delivered
but on the condition of his becoming catholic<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>The detail of this con&s;piracy is to be found in a letter of the Queen of Scots to Charles Paget, her great confident. This letter is dated the 20th of May 1586, and is contained in Dr. Forbes's manu&s;cript collections&punc; at pre&s;ent in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of lord Roy&s;ton. It is a copy atte&s;ted by Curle. Mary's &s;ecretary, and indor&s;ed by lord Burleigh. What proves its authen|ticity beyond que&s;tion is that we find in Murden's Collection, p. 516, that Mary actually wrote that very day a letter to Charles Paget: And farther, &s;he mentions, in the manu&s;cript letter, a letter of Charles Paget's of the roth of April: Now we find by Murden, p. 506. that Charles Paget did actually write her a letter of that date.</P>
<P>This violence of &s;pirit is very con&s;i&s;tent with Mary's character. Her maternal affection was too weak to oppo&s;e the gratification of her pa&s;&s;ions, particularly her pride, her ambition, and her bigotry, Her &s;on, having made &s;ome fruitle&s;s attempts to a&s;&s;ociate her with him in the title, and having found this &s;cheme impracticable, on account of the prejudices of his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, at la&s;t de&s;i&s;ted from that de&s;ign, and entered into an alliance with England, without comprehending his mother. She was in &s;uch a rage at this undutiful behaviour, as &s;he imagined it, that &s;he wrote to Queen Elizabeth, that &s;he no longer cared what became of him or her in the world; the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction &s;he could have before her death was to &s;ee him and all his adherents become a &s;ignal example of tyranny, ingra|titude and impiety, and undergo the vengeance of God for their wickedne&s;s. She would find in Chri&s;tendom other heirs, and doubted not to put her inheritance in &s;uch hands as would retain the firme&s;t hold of it. She cared not, after taking this revenge, what became of her body: The quicke&s;t death would then be the mo&s;t agreeable to her. And &s;he a&s;&s;ured her, that, if he per&s;evered, &s;he would di&s;own him for her &s;on, would give him her malediction, would di&s;inherit him, as well of his pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions as of all he could expect by her; abandoning him not only to her &s;ubjects to treat him as they had done her, but to all &s;trangers to &s;ubdue and conquer him. It was in vain to employ menaces again&s;t her: The fear of death or other misfortune would never induce her to make one &s;tep or pronounce one &s;yllable beyond what &s;he had determined: She would rather peri&s;h with honour, in maintaining the dignity, to which God had rai&s;ed her, than degrade her&s;elf by the lea&s;t pu&s;illanimity, or act what was unworthy of her &s;tation and of her race.

<P><PB N="302" REF="331">
THE only part of the charge, which Mary po&s;itively
denied, was her concurrence in the de&s;ign of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inat|ing
Queen Elizbeth: This article indeed was the
mo&s;t heavy, and the only one, which could fully ju&s;tify
the Queen in proceeding to extremities again&s;t her.
In order to prove the accu&s;ation, there were produced
the following evidence: Copies taken in &s;ecretary
Wal&s;ingham's office of the intercepted letters between
her and Babington, in which her approbation of the
murder was clearly expre&s;&s;ed; the evidence of her two
&s;ecretaries, Nau and Curle, who had &s;worn without
being put to any torture, that &s;he both received the&s;e
letters from Babington, and that they had wrote the
an&s;wers by her order; the con&s;fe&s;&s;ion of Babington,
that he had wrote the letters and received the an|&s;wers<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 113.</NOTE>; and the confe&s;&s;ion of Ballard and Savage,
that Babington had &s;howed them the&s;e letters of
Mary, wrote in the cypher, which had been &s;ettled
between them.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that this &s;eeming complication of
evidence re&s;olves it&s;elf finally into the te&s;timony of the
two &s;ecretaries, who alone were acquainted with their
mi&s;tre&s;s's concurrence in Babington's con&s;piracy, and
who knew them&s;elves expo&s;ed to all the rigours of
impri&s;onment, torture and death, if they refu&s;ed to
give any evidence, which might be required of them.
In the ca&s;e of an ordinary criminal, this proof, with
all its di&s;advantages, would be e&s;teemed legal, and even
&s;atisfactory, if not oppo&s;ed by &s;ome other circum|&s;tances,
which &s;hake the credit of the witne&s;&s;es: But
on the pre&s;ent trial, where the ab&s;olute power of the
pro&s;ecutor concurred with &s;uch important intere&s;ts and
&s;uch a &s;trong inclination to have the prince&s;s con|demned;
<PB N="303" REF="332">
the te&s;timony of two witne&s;&s;es, even tho'
men of character, ought to be &s;upported by very &s;trong
circum&s;tances, in order to remove all &s;u&s;picion of
tyranny and inju&s;tice. The proof again&s;t Mary, it
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is not de&s;tituted of this advantage;
and it is very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to account
for Babington's receiving an an&s;wer, wrote in her
name, and in the cypher concerted between them,
without allowing, that the matter had been commu|nicated
to that prince&s;s. Such is the light in which
this matter appears, even after time has di&s;covered
every thing, which could guide our judgment with
regard to it: No wonder, therefore, that the Queen
of Scots, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by council, and confounded by &s;o
extraordinary a trial, found her&s;elf incapable of mak|ing
a &s;atisfactory defence before the commi&s;&s;ioners.
Her reply con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in her own denial: What|ever
force may be in that denial was much weakened,
by her po&s;itively affirming, that &s;he never had had any
corre&s;pondence of any kind with Babington; a fact,
however, of which there remains not the lea&s;t que&s;ti|on<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The volume of State Papers collected by Mr. Murden, prove beyond controver&s;y, that Mary was long in clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with Babington, p. 513, 516, 532. 533. She entertained a like corre&s;pondence with Ballard, Morgan, and Charles Paget, and laid a &s;cheme with them for an in&s;urrection, and for the inva&s;ion of England by Spain, p. 528, 531. The &s;ame papers &s;how, that there had been a di&s;continuance of Babington's corre&s;pondence, agreeable to Camden's narration. See State Papers, p. 513, where Morgan recommends it to Queen Mary to renew the cor|re&s;pondence with Babington. The former letters, which pa&s;&s;ed between that Queen and Babington, &s;eem to have been de&s;troyed by &s;ome accident. The&s;e circum&s;tances prove, that no weight can be laid on Mary's denial of guilt, and that her corre&s;pondence with Babington contained particu|lars, which could not be avowed.</NOTE>.
She a&s;&s;erted, that as Nau and Curle had taken
an oath of &s;ecrecy and fidelity to her, their evidence
again&s;t her ought not to be credited. She confe&s;&s;ed,
however, that Nau had been in the &s;ervice of her uncle,
the cardinal of Lorraine, and had been recommended
<PB N="304" REF="333">
to her by the King of France, as a man in whom
&s;he might &s;afely confide. She al&s;o acknowleged Curle
to be a very hone&s;t man, but &s;imple, and ea&s;ily im|po&s;ed
on by Nau. If the&s;e two men had received any
letters, or had wrote any an&s;wers, without her know|lege;
the imputation, &s;he &s;aid, could never lie on her.
And &s;he was the more inclined, &s;he added, to enter|tain
this &s;u&s;picion again&s;t them, becau&s;e Nau had, in
other in&s;tances, been guilty of a like temerity, and
had ventured to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s in her name, without
communicating the matter to her<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>There are three &s;uppo&s;itions, by which the letter to Babington may be accounted for, without allowing Mary's concurrence in the con&s;piracy for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Elizabeth. The fir&s;t is, that which &s;he &s;eems her&s;elf to have embraced, that her &s;ecretaries had received Babington's letter, and had ven|rured of them&s;elves to an&s;wer it, without communicating the matter to her: But it is utterly improbable, that a prince&s;s of that &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit would, in an affair of that importance, be &s;o treated by her &s;ervants who lived in the hou&s;e with her, and who had every moment an opportunity of commu|nicating the fecret to her. If the con&s;piracy failed, they mu&s;t expect to &s;uf|fer the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment from the court of England; if it &s;ucceeded, the lighte&s;t puni&s;hment, which they could hope for from their own mi&s;tre&s;s, mu&s;t be di&s;grace, on account of their temerity, Not to mention, that Ma|ry's concurrence was in &s;ome degree requi&s;ite for effectuating the de&s;ign of her e&s;cape: It was propo&s;ed to attack her guards, while &s;he was employed in hunting: She mu&s;t therefore concert the time and place with the con&s;pira|tors. The &s;econd &s;uppo&s;ition is, that the&s;e two &s;ecretaries were previously traitors; and being gained by Wal&s;ingham, had made &s;uch a reply in their mi&s;tre&s;s's cypher, as might involve her in the guilt of the con&s;piracy. But the&s;e two men had lived long with the Queen of Scots, had been entirely tru&s;ted by her, and had never fallen under &s;u&s;picion either with her or her partizans. Camden tells us, that Curle afterwards claimed a reward from Wal&s;ingham on pretence of &s;ome promi&s;e; but Wal&s;ingham told him, that he owed him no reward, and that he had made no di&s;coveries on his examination, which were not known with certainty from other quaters. The third &s;uppo&s;ition is, that neither the Queen nor the two &s;ecretaries, Nau and Curle, ever &s;aw Babington's letter, or made any an&s;wer; but that Wal&s;ingham, having decyphered the former, forged a reply. But this &s;uppo&s;ition implies the fal&s;hood of the whole &s;tory, told by Camden, of Gifford's acce&s;s to the Queen of Scots's family, and Paulet's refu&s;al to concur in allowing his &s;ervants to be bribed. Not to mention, that as Nau's and Curle's evidence mu&s;t, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, have been extorted by violence and terror, they would nece&s;&s;arily have been engaged, for their own ju&s;tification, to have told the truth afterwards; e&s;pecially upon the acce&s;&s;ion of James. But Camden informs us, that Nau, even after that event, per&s;i&s;ted &s;till in his te&s;timony.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o con&s;ider, that the two la&s;t &s;uppo&s;itions imply &s;uch a mon|&s;trous criminal conduct in Wal&s;ingham, and con&s;equently in Elizabeth (for the matter could be no &s;ecret to her) as exceeds all credibility. If we con|&s;ider the &s;ituation of things and the prejudices of the times, Mary's con&s;ent to Babington's con&s;piracy appears much more natural and probable. She believed Elizabeth to be an u&s;urper and a heretic: She regarded her as a per|&s;onal and a violent enemy: She knew that &s;chemes of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating heretics were very familiar in that age, and generally approved of by the zealous catho|lies: Her own liberty and &s;overeignty were connected with the &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize. And it cannot appear &s;trange, that where men of &s;o much merit as Babington could be engaged, by bigotry alone, in &s;o criminal an enterprize, Mary, who was actuated by the&s;ame motive, joined to &s;o many others, &s;hould have given her con&s;ent to a &s;cheme projected by her friends. We may be previou&s;ly certain, that, if &s;uch a &s;cheme was ever communicated to her, with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he would a&s;&s;ent to it: And it &s;erved the purpo&s;e of Wal&s;ingham and the Engli&s;h mini&s;try to facilitate the communi|cation of the&s;e &s;chemes, as &s;oon as they had got an expedient for intercepting her an&s;wer, and detecting the con&s;piracy. Now Wal&s;ingham's knowlege of the matter is a &s;uppo&s;ition nece&s;&s;ary to account for the letter delivered to Babington.</P>
<P>As to the not puni&s;hing of Nau and Curle by Elizabeth, it never is the practice to puni&s;h le&s;&s;er criminals, who had given evidence again&s;t the principal.</P>
<P>But what ought to induce us to reject the&s;e three &s;uppo&s;itions, is, that they mu&s;t, all of them, be con&s;idered as bare po&s;&s;ibilities; The partizans of Mary can give no rea&s;on for preferring one to the other: Not the &s;lighte&s;t evidence ever appeared to &s;upport any one of them: Neither at that time, nor at any time after, was any rea&s;on di&s;covered, by the numerous zealots at home and abroad who had embraced Mary's defence, to lead us to the belief of any of the&s;e three &s;uppo&s;itions: and even her apologi&s;ts at pre&s;ent &s;eem not to have fixed on any choice among the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ibilities. The po&s;itive proof of two credible witne&s;&s;es, &s;upported by the other very &s;trong circum&s;tances, &s;till remains unimpeached. Babington, who had an ex|treme intere&s;t to have communication with the Queen of Scots, believed he had found a means of corre&s;pondence with her, and had received an an&s;wer from her: He, as well as the other con&s;pirators, died in that belief: There has not occurred, &s;ince that time, the lea&s;t argument to prove they were mi&s;taken: Can there be any rea&s;on at pre&s;ent to doubt of the truth of their opinion? Camden, tho' a profe&s;t apologi&s;t for Mary, is con|&s;trained to tell the &s;tory in &s;uch a manner as evidently &s;uppo&s;es her guilt. Such was the impo&s;&s;ibility of finding any other con&s;i&s;tent account, even by a man of parts, who was a contemporary!</P>
<P>In this light might the que&s;tion have appeared even during Mary's trial. But what now puts her guilt beyond all controver&s;y is the following pa&s;&s;age of her letter to Thomas Morgan, dated the 27th of July 1586. &startq;As to Babington, he hath both kindly and hone&s;tly offered him&s;elf and all his means to be employed any way I would. Whereupon I hope to have &s;a|tisfied him by two of my &s;everal letters, &s;ince I had his; and the rather, for that I opened him the way, whereby I received his with your afore|&s;aid.&endq; Murden, p. 533. Babington confe&s;&s;ed, that he had offered her to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the Queen; It appears by this, that &s;he had accepted the offer: So that all the &s;uppo&s;itions of Wal&s;ingham's forgery, or her &s;ecretary's temerity or treachery, fall to the ground.</P></NOTE>.</P>

affirming that they never would to her face per&s;i&s;t in
their evidence. But that demand, however equitable,
was not &s;upported by law in trials of high trea&s;on, and
was often refu&s;ed even in other trials where the crown
was pro&s;ecutor. The clau&s;e, contained in an act of
the 13th of the Queen, was a novelty; that the &s;pecies
of trea&s;on there enumerated mu&s;t be proved by two
witne&s;&s;es, confronted with the criminal. But Mary
was not tried upon that act; and the mini&s;ters and
crown lawyers of this reign were always &s;ure to refu&s;e
every indulgence beyond what the &s;trict letter of the
law and the &s;ettled practice of the courts of ju&s;tice re|quired
of them. Not to mention, that the&s;e &s;ecretaries
were not probably at Fotheringay during the time of the
trial, and could not, upon Mary's demand, be produced
by the commi&s;&s;ioners<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Queen Elizabeth was willing to have allowed Curle and Nau to be pro|duced in the trial, and writes to that purpo&s;e, to Burleigh and Wal&s;ingham, in her letter of the 7th of October, in Forbes's MS. collections.

<P>THERE pa&s;&s;ed two incidents in this trial, which
may be worth ob&s;erving. A letter between Mary and
Babington was read, in which mention was made of
the earl of Arundel and his brothers: On hearing
their names &s;he broke into a &s;igh, &startq;Alas,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,
<PB N="307" REF="340">
what has that noble hou&s;e of the Howards &s;uffered
for my &s;ake!&endq; She affirmed, with regard to the &s;ame
letter, that it was ea&s;y to forge the hand-writing and
cypher of another; &s;he was afraid, that this was too
familiar a practice with Wal&s;ingham, who, &s;he al&s;o
heard, had frequently practi&s;ed both again&s;t her life and
her &s;on's. Wal&s;ingham, who was one of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
ro&s;e up. He prote&s;ted, that in his private
capacity, he had never acted any thing again&s;t the
Queen of Scots: In his public capacity, he owned,
that his concern for his &s;overeign's &s;afety had made
him very diligent in &s;earching out, by every expedient,
all de&s;igns again&s;t her &s;acred per&s;on or her authority.
For attaining that end, he would not only make
u&s;e of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ballard or any other con&s;pirator:
He would al&s;o reward them for betraying their com|panions.
But if he had tampered in any manner, un|worthy
of his character and office, why did none of the
late criminals either at their trial or execution, accu&s;e
him of &s;uch practices? Mary endeavoured to pacify
him by &s;aying that &s;he &s;poke from information; and
&s;he begged him, that he would thenceforth give no
more credit to &s;uch as &s;landered her, than &s;he would to
&s;uch as accu&s;ed him. The great character indeed,
which Sir Francis Wal&s;ingham bears for probity and
honour, &s;hould remove from him all &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch
ba&s;e arts as forgery and &s;ubornation; arts, which even
the mo&s;t corrupt mini&s;ters in the mo&s;t corrupt times
would &s;cruple to employ.</P>
<P>HAVING fini&s;hed the trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2$th Octo|ber.</NOTE> the commi&s;&s;ioners ad|journed
from Fotheringay, and met in the Star Cham|ber
at London; where, after taking the oaths of Mary's
two &s;ecretaries, who, voluntarily, without hope or
reward, vouched the authenticity of tho&s;e letters before
produced, they pronounced &s;entence of death upon
the Queen of Scots, and confirmed it by their &s;eals and
&s;ub&s;criptions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentence a|gain&s;t Mary.</NOTE> The &s;ame day, a declaration was pub|li&s;hed
<PB N="308" REF="341">
by the commi&s;&s;ioners and the judges, &startq;that the
&s;entence did no wi&s;e derogate from the title and honour
of James, King of Scotland; but that he was in the
&s;ame place, degree, and right, as if the &s;entence
had never been pronounced<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 526.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Queen had now brought her affairs with Mary
to that &s;ituation, which &s;he had long ardently de&s;ired;
and had found a plau&s;ible rea&s;on for executing vengeance
on a competitor, whom, from the beginning of her
reign, &s;he had ever equally dreaded and hated. But
&s;he was re&s;trained from gratifying in&s;tantly her re|&s;entment,
by &s;everal important con&s;iderations. She
fore&s;aw the invidious colours in which this example of
uncommon juri&s;diction would be repre&s;ented by the
numerous partizans of Mary, and the reproach, to
which &s;he her&s;elf might be expo&s;ed with all foreign
princes, perhaps with all po&s;terity. The rights of
ho&s;pitality, of kindred, and of royal maje&s;ty, &s;eemed
in one &s;ignal in&s;tance to be all violated; and this &s;acri|fice
of genero&s;ity to intere&s;t, of clemency to revenge,
might appear equally unbecoming a &s;overereign and a
woman. Elizabeth, therefore, who was an excellent
hypocrite, pretended the utmo&s;t reluctance to proceed
to the execution of the &s;entence, affected the mo&s;t tender
&s;ympathy with her pri&s;oner, di&s;played all her &s;cruples
and difficulties, rejected the &s;ollicitation of her courtiers
and mini&s;ters, and affirmed, that, were &s;he not moved
by the deepe&s;t concern for her people's &s;afety, &s;he would
not he&s;itate a moment in pardoning all the injuries, which
&s;he her&s;elf had received from the Queen of Scots.</P>
<P>THAT the voice of her people might be more audibly
heard in the demand of ju&s;tice upon Mary, &s;he &s;um|moned
a new Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th Octo|ber.</NOTE> and &s;he knew, both from
the u&s;ual di&s;po&s;itions of that a&s;&s;embly, and from the
influence of her mini&s;ters over them, that &s;he &s;hould
not want the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;ollicitation to con&s;ent to
<PB N="309" REF="342">
that mea&s;ure, which was &s;o agreeable to her &s;ecret
inclinations. She did not open this a&s;&s;embly in per&s;on,
but appointed for that purpo&s;e three commi&s;&s;ioners, the
chancellor Bromley, the trea&s;urer Burleigh, and the
earl of Derby. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for this mea&s;ure,
was, that the Queen, fore&s;eeing that the affair of the
Queen of Scots would be tried in Parliament, found
her tenderne&s;s and delicacy &s;o much hurt by that
melancholy incident, that &s;he had not the courage
to be pre&s;ent while it was under deliberation, but
withdrew her eyes from what &s;he could not behold
without the utmo&s;t reluctance and unea&s;ine&s;s. She was
al&s;o willing, that, by this unu&s;ual caution, the people

<P>THE Parliament an&s;wered the Queen's expectations:
The &s;entence again&s;t Mary was unanimou&s;ly ratified by
both hou&s;es; and an application was agreed on to obtain
Elizabeth's con&s;ent to its publication and execution<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 379.</NOTE>.
She gave them an an&s;wer ambiguous, embarra&s;&s;ed; full
of real artifice, and &s;eeming irre&s;olution. She men|tioned
the extreme danger to which her life was con|tinually
expo&s;ed; &s;he declared her willingne&s;s to die,
did &s;he not fore&s;ee the great calamities, which would
thence fall upon the nation; &s;he made profe&s;&s;ions of
the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s to her people; &s;he di&s;played the
clemency of her temper, and expre&s;&s;ed her violent re|luctance
to proceed to extremities again&s;t her unhappy
kin&s;woman; &s;he affirmed, that the late laws by which
that prince&s;s was tried, &s;o far from being made to
en&s;nare her, was only intended to give her warning
beforehand, not to engage in &s;uch attempts, as might
expo&s;e her to the penalties, with which &s;he was thus
<PB N="310" REF="343">
openly menaced; and &s;he begged them to think once
again, whether it was po&s;&s;ible to find any other ex|pedient
be&s;ides the death of the Queen of Scots for
&s;ecuring the public tranquillity<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 402, 403.</NOTE>. The Parliament,
in obedience to her commands, took the affair again
under con&s;ideration; but could find no other po&s;&s;ible
expedient. They reiterated their &s;ollicitations, and
entreaties, and arguments: They even remon&s;trated,
that mercy to the Queen of Scots was cruelty to them,
her &s;ubjects and children: And they affirmed, that it
were inju&s;tice to deny execution of the law to any
individual; much more, to the whole body of the
people, now unanimou&s;ly and earne&s;tly &s;uing for this
pledge of her parental care and tenderne&s;s. This &s;econd
addre&s;s &s;et the pretended doubts and &s;cruples of Eliza|beth
anew in agitation: She complained of her own
unfortunate &s;ituation; expre&s;&s;ed her unea&s;ine&s;s from
their importunity; renewed the profe&s;&s;ions of affection
to her people; and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the committee of Par|liament
in an uncertainty, what, after all this deli|beration,
might be her final re&s;olution<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>This Parliament granted the Queen a &s;upply of a &s;ub&s;idy and two fifteenths. They adjourned, and met again after the execution of the Queen of Scots; when there pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome remarkable incidents, which it may be proper not to omit. We &s;hall give them in the words of Sir Simon D'Ewes, p. 410, 411, which are almo&s;t wholly tran&s;cribed from Town&s;end's Journal. On Monday the 27th of February, Mr. Cope, fir&s;t u&s;ing &s;ome &s;peeches touching the nece&s;&s;ity of a learned mini&s;try and the amendment of things ami&s;s in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tate, offered to the hou&s;e a bill and a book written; the bill containing a petition, that it might be enacted, that all laws now in force touching eccle&s;ia&s;tical government &s;hould be void: And that it might be enacted that that book of common prayer now offered, and none other, might be received into the church to be u&s;ed. The book contained the form of prayer and admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments, with divers rites and ceremonies to be u&s;ed in the church; and he de&s;ired that the book might be read. Whereupon Mr. Speaker in effect u&s;ed this &s;peech: For that her maje&s;ty before this time had commanded the hou&s;e not to meddle with this matter, and that her maje&s;ty had promi&s;ed to take order in tho&s;e cau&s;es, he doubted not but to the good &s;atisfaction of all her people, he de&s;ired that it would plea&s;e them to &s;pare the reading of it. Notwith&s;tanding the hou&s;e de&s;ired the reading of it. Whereupon Mr. Speaker de&s;ired the clerk to read. And the court being ready to read it, Mr. Dalton made a motion again&s;t the reading of it; &s;aying, that it was not meet to be read, and it did appoint a new form of admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments and ceremonies of the church, to the di&s;|credit of the book of common prayer and of the whole &s;tate; and thought that this dealing would bring her maje&s;ty's indignation again&s;t the hou&s;e, thus to enterprize this dealing with tho&s;e things which her maje&s;ty e&s;pecially had taken into her own charge and direction. Whereupon Mr. Lewkenor &s;pake, &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity of preaching and of a learned mini&s;try, and thought it very &s;it that the petition and book &s;hould be read. To this pur|po&s;e &s;pake Mr. Hurle&s;ton and Mr. Bainbrigg; and &s;o, the time being pa&s;&s;ed, the hou&s;e broke up, and neither the petition nor book read. This done, her maje&s;ty &s;ent to Mr. Speaker, as well for this petition and book, as for that other petition and book for the like effect, that was delivered the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliment, which Mr. Speaker &s;ent to her maje&s;ty. On Tue&s;day the 28th of February, her Maje&s;ty &s;ent for Mr. Speaker, by occa|&s;ion whereof the hou&s;e did not &s;it. On Wedne&s;day the fir&s;t day of March, Mr. Wentworth delivered to Mr. Speaker certain articles, which contained que&s;tions touching the liberties of the hou&s;e, and to &s;ome of which he was to an&s;wer, and de&s;ired they might be read. Mr. Speaker de&s;ired him to &s;pare his motion, until her Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure was further known touching the petition and book lately delivered into the hou&s;e; but Mr. Wentworth would not be &s;o &s;atisfied, but required his articles might be read. Mr. Wentworth introduced his queries by lamenting, that he as well as many others were deterred from &s;peaking, by their want of knowlege and experience in the liberties of the hou&s;e; and the queries were as follow: Whether this coun|cil were not a place for any member of the &s;ame here a&s;&s;embled, freely and without controulment of any per&s;on or danger of laws, by bill or &s;peech to utter any of the griefs of this commonwealth what&s;oever touching the &s;ervice of God, the &s;afety of the prince and this noble realm? Whether that great honour may be done unto God, and benefit and &s;ervice unto the prince and &s;tate, without free &s;peech in this council that may be done with it? Whether there be any council which can make, add, or dimini&s;h from the laws of the realm but only this council of Parliament? Whether it be not again&s;t the orders of this council to make any &s;ecret or matter of weight, which is here in hand, known to the prince or any other, concerning the high &s;ervice of God, prince or &s;tate, without the con&s;ent of the hou&s;e? Whether the &s;peaker or any other may interrupt any member of this council in his &s;peech u&s;ed in this hou&s;e tending to any of the forenamed &s;ervices? Whether the &s;peaker may ri&s;e when he will, any matter being pro|pounded, without con&s;ent of the hou&s;e or not? Whether the &s;peaker may over-rule the hou&s;e in any matter or cau&s;e there in que&s;tion, or whether he is to be ruled or over-rule$ in any matter or not? Whether the prince and &s;tate can continue, and &s;tand, and be maintained, without this council of Parliament, not altering the government of the &s;tate? At the end of the&s;e que&s;tions, &s;ays Sir Simon D'Ewes, I found &s;et down this &s;hort note or memorial en&s;uing: By which it may be perceived, both what &s;erjeant Puckering, the &s;peaker, did with the &s;aid que&s;tions after he had received them, and what became al&s;o of this bu&s;ine&s;s, viz. &startq;The&s;e que&s;tions Mr. Puckering pocketed up and &s;hewed Sir Thomas Heneage, who &s;o handled the matter, that Mr. Wentworth went to the Tower, and the que&s;tions not at all moved. Mr. Buckler of E&s;&s;ex herein brake his faith in for&s;aking the matter, &amp;c. and no more was done.&endq; After &s;etting down, continues Sir Simon D'Ewes, the &s;aid bu&s;ine&s;s of Mr. Wentworth in the original journal book, there follows only this &s;hort conclu&s;ion of the day it&s;elf, viz. &startq;This day, Mr. Speaker being &s;ent for to the Queen's maje&s;ty, the hou&s;e departed.&endq; On Thur&s;day the &s;econd of March, Mr. Cope, Mr. Lewkenor, Mr. Hurl&s;ton, and Mr. Bainbrigg were &s;ent for to my lord chancellor and by divers of the privy council, and from thence were &s;ent to the Tower. On Saturday, the fourth day of March, Sir John Higham made a motion to this hou&s;e, for that divers good and nece&s;&s;ary members thereof were taken from them, that it would plea&s;e them to be humble petitioners to her maje&s;ty for the re&s;titution of them again to the hou&s;e. To which &s;peeches Mr. vice-chamberlain an&s;wered, that if the gentle|men were committed for matter within the compa&s;s of the privilege of this hou&s;e, then there might be a petition; but if not, then we &s;hould give occa&s;ion to her maje&s;ty's farther di&s;plea&s;ure: And therefore advi&s;ed to &s;tay until they heard more, which could not be long: And farther, he &s;aid touching the book and the petition, her maje&s;ty had, for diver&s;e good cau&s;es be&s;t known to her&s;elf, thought fit to &s;uppre&s;s the &s;ame, without any far|ther examination thereof; and yet thought it very unfit for her maje&s;ty to give any account of her doings.&mdash;But what&s;oever Mr. vice-chamber|lain pretended, it is mo&s;t probable the&s;e members were committed for intermeddling with matters touching the church, which her maje&s;ty had often inhibited, and which had cau&s;ed &s;o much di&s;putation and &s;o many meetings between the two hou&s;es the la&s;t Parliament.&endq;</P>
<P>This is all we find of the matter in Sir Simon D'Ewes and Town&s;end; and it appears that tho&s;e members, who had been committed, were detain|ed in cu&s;tody till the Queen thought fit to relea&s;e them. The&s;e que&s;tions of Mr. Wentworth are curious; becau&s;e they contain the fir&s;t faint dawn|ings of the pre&s;ent Engli&s;h con&s;titution; tho' &s;uddenly eclip&s;ed by the arbitra|ry government of Elizabeth. Wentworth was indeed, by his puritani&s;m, as well as his love of liberty (for the&s;e two characters, of &s;uch unequal merit, aro&s;e and advanced together) the true forerunner of the Hambdens, the Pyms, and the Hollises, who, in the next age, with le&s;s courage, becau&s;e with le&s;s danger, rendered their principles &s;o triumphant. I &s;hall only a&s;k, whether it be not &s;ufficiently clear from all the&s;e tran&s;actions, that in the two &s;ucceeding reigns it was the people who encroached upon the &s;overeign; not the &s;overeign, who attempted, as is pretended, to u&s;urp upon people?</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="344">
BUT tho' the Queen affected reluctance to execute
the &s;entence again&s;t Mary, &s;he complied with the Par|liament's
reque&s;t to publi&s;h it; and the proclamation
<PB N="312" REF="345">
&s;eemed to be attended with the unanimous and hearty
rejoicings of the people. The lord Buckhur&s;t, and
<PB N="313" REF="346">
Beale, clerk to the Council, were &s;ent to the Queen
of Scots, and notified to her the &s;entence pronounced
again&s;t her, its ratification by Parliament, and the
earne&s;t applications made for its execution by that
a&s;&s;embly, who thought, that their religion could never,
while &s;he was alive attain a full &s;ettlement and &s;ecuri|ty.
Mary was no wi&s;e di&s;mayed at this intelligence:
On the contrary, &s;he joyfully laid hold of the la&s;t cir|cum&s;tance
mentioned to her; and in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;ince
her death was demanded by the prote&s;tants for the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of their faith, &s;he was really a martyr
to her religion, and was intitled to all the merits,
attending that glorious character. She added, that
the Engli&s;h had often imbrued their hands in the blood
of their &s;overeigns: No wonder, they exerci&s;ed cruelty
towards her, who derived her de&s;cent from the&s;e
monarchs<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 528.</NOTE>. Paulet her keeper, received orders to take
down her canopy, and to &s;erve her no longer with that
re&s;pect, due to &s;overeign princes. He told her, that
&s;he was now to be con&s;idered as a dead per&s;on; and
incapable of any dignity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 293.</NOTE>. This in&s;ult &s;he received
without any &s;eeming emotion. She only replied, that
&s;he received her royal character from the hands of the
Almighty, and no earthly power was ever able to
bereave her of it.</P>
<P>THE Queen of Scots wrote her la&s;t letter to Eliza|beth;
full of dignity, without departing from that &s;pirit
of meekne&s;s and of charity, which appeared &s;uitable
to this concluding &s;cene of her unfortunate life. She
preferred no petition for averting the fatal &s;entence:
On the contrary, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude to heaven
<PB N="314" REF="347">
for thus bringing to a &s;peedy period her &s;ad and lamenta|ble
pilgrimage. She reque&s;ted &s;ome favours of Eliza|beth,
and intreated her, that &s;he might be beholden for
them to her own goodne&s;s alone, without making ap|plications
to tho&s;e mini&s;ters, who had di&s;covered &s;uch
an extreme antipathy to her per&s;on and her religion.
She de&s;ired, that, after her enemies &s;hould be &s;atiated
with her innocent blood, her body, which, it was
determined, &s;hould never enjoy re&s;t, while her &s;oul
was united to it, might be con&s;igned to her &s;ervants,
and be conveyed by them into France, there to repo&s;e
in a catholic land, with the &s;acred relicts of her
mother. In Scotland, &s;he &s;aid, the &s;epulchres of her
ance&s;tors were violated, and the churches either
demoli&s;hed or profaned; and in England, where &s;he
might be enterred among the antient kings, her own
and Elizabeth's progenitors, &s;he could entertain no
hopes of being accompanied to the grave with tho&s;e
rites and ceremonies, which her religion required.
She de&s;ired that no one might have the power of in|flicting
a private death upon her, without Elizabeth's
knowlege; but that her execution &s;hould be public,
and attended by her antient &s;ervants, who might bear
te&s;timony of her per&s;everance in the faith, and of her
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of heaven. She begged, that
the&s;e &s;ervants might afterwards be allowed to depart
whither they plea&s;ed, and might enjoy tho&s;e legacies
which &s;he &s;hould bequeath them. And &s;he conjured
her to grant the&s;e favours, by their near kindred, by
the &s;oul and memory of Henry the &s;eventh, the common
ance&s;tor of both, and by the royal dignity of which
they equally participated<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 529. Jebb, vol. II. p. 295.</NOTE>. Elizabeth made no an&s;wer
to this letter; being unwilling to give Mary a refu&s;al in
her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and fore&s;eeing inconveniencies
from granting &s;ome of her reque&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="348">
WHILE the Queen of Scots thus prepared her&s;elf to
meet her fate, great efforts were made by foreign
powers with Elizabeth to prevent the execution of
the &s;entence, pronounced again&s;t her. Be&s;ides em|ploying
L'Aube&s;pine, the French re&s;ident at London,
a man devoted to the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e, Henry &s;ent
over Bellievre, with a profe&s;&s;ed intention of interceding
for the life of Mary. The duke of Gui&s;e and the
league, at that time, threatened very nearly the King's
authority; and Elizabeth knew, that, tho' that monarch
might, from decency and policy, think him&s;elf obliged
to interpo&s;e publicly in behalf of the Queen of Scots,
he could not &s;ecretly be much di&s;plea&s;ed with the death
of a prince&s;s, on who&s;e fortune and elevation his
mortal enemies had always founded &s;o many daring
and ambitious projects<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 494.</NOTE>. It is even pretended, that
Bellievre had orders, after making public and vehe|ment
remon&s;trances again&s;t the execution of Mary, to
exhort privately the Queen, in his ma&s;ter's name,
not to defer an act of ju&s;tice, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for their
common intere&s;ts<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Du Maurier.</NOTE>. But whether the French King's
interce&s;&s;ion was &s;incere or not, it had no weight
with the Queen; and &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in her former
re&s;olution.</P>
<P>THE interpo&s;ition of the young King of Scots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Interpo&s;ition of King James.</NOTE> tho'
it was not able to change Elizabeth's determination,
&s;eemed, on every account, to merit more attention.
So &s;oon as James heard of the trial and condemnation
of his mother, he &s;ent Sir William Keith, gentleman
of his bed chamber, to London; and wrote a letter
to the Queen, in which he remon&s;trated, in very
&s;evere terms, again&s;t the indignity of the procedure.
He &s;aid, that he was a&s;toni&s;hed to hear of the pre|&s;umption
of Engli&s;h noblemen and coun&s;ellors, who
had dared to &s;it in judgment and pa&s;s &s;entence upon a
Queen of Scotland, de&s;cended from the royal blood
<PB N="316" REF="349">
of England; but was &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed to hear,
that thoughts were &s;eriou&s;ly entertained of putting
that &s;entence in execution: That he entreated Eliza|beth
to reflect on the di&s;honour, which &s;he would
draw on her name by embruing her hands in the
blood of her near kin&s;woman, a per&s;on of the &s;ame
royal dignity and of the &s;ame &s;ex with her&s;elf: That
in this unparalleled attempt, &s;he offered an affront to all
diadems, and even to her own; and by reducing &s;o|vereigns
to a level with other men, taught the people
to neglect all duty towards tho&s;e whom Providence had
appointed to rule over them: That for his part, he
mu&s;t e&s;teem the injury and in&s;ult &s;o enormous, as to
be incapable of all attonement; nor was it po&s;&s;ible
for him thenceforth to remain on any terms of corre|&s;pondence
with a per&s;on, who, without any pretence
of legal authority, had deliberately inflicted an igno|minious
death upon his parent: And that even if the
&s;entiments of nature and duty did not in&s;pire him with
this purpo&s;e of vengeance, his own honour required it
of him; nor could he ever acquit him&s;elf in the eyes
of the world, if he did not u&s;e every effort, and endure
every hazard, to revenge &s;o great an indignity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 351.</NOTE>.
Soon after, James &s;ent the ma&s;ter of Gray and Sir
Robert Melvil to enforce the remon&s;trances of Keith;
and to employ with the Queen every expedient of ar|gument
and menaces. Elizabeth was at fir&s;t offended
with the &s;harpne&s;s of the&s;e applications; and &s;he re|plied
in a like &s;train to the Scots amba&s;&s;adors. When
&s;he afterwards reflected, that this earne&s;tne&s;s was no
more than what duty required of James, &s;he was
pacified; but retained &s;till her re&s;olution of proceed|ing
to extremities again&s;t Mary<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 353.</NOTE>. It is believed,
that the ma&s;ter of Gray, gained by the enemies of
that prince&s;s, gave &s;ecretly his advice not to &s;pare
<PB N="317" REF="350">
her, and undertook, in all events, to pacify his ma&s;ter.
The Queen al&s;o, from many circum&s;tances, was in|duced
to pay &s;mall attention to the applications of
James, and to di&s;regard all the efforts, which he could
employ in behalf of his mother. She was well ac|quainted
with his character and intere&s;ts, the factions
which prevailed among his people, and the inveterate
hatred, which the zealous prote&s;tants, particularly the
preachers, bore to the Queen of Scots. The pre&s;ent
incidents put the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of the clergy in a full
light. James, ob&s;erving the fixed purpo&s;e of Eliza|beth,
ordered prayers to be offered up for his mother in
all the churches; and knowing the captious humour
of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, he took care that the form of the
petition &s;hould be mo&s;t cautious, as well as humane
and charitable: &startq;That it might plea&s;e God to illumi|nate
Mary with the light of his truth, and &s;ave
her from the apparent danger with which &s;he was
threatned.&endq; But excepting the King's own chap|lains,
and one clergyman more, all the preachers re|fu&s;ed
to pollute their churches by prayers for a papi&s;t,
and would not &s;o much as prefer a petition for her
conver&s;ion. James, unwilling or unable to puni&s;h
this di&s;obedience, and de&s;irous of giving the preachers
an opportunity of amending their fault, appointed a
new day when prayers &s;hould be &s;aid for his mother;
and that he might at lea&s;t &s;ecure him&s;elf from any
in&s;ult in his own pre&s;ence, he de&s;ired the archbi&s;hop
of St. Andrews to preach before him. In order to di&s;|appoint
this purpo&s;e, the clergy in&s;tigated one Couper,
a young man, who had not yet received holy orders,
to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pulpit early in the morning,
and to exclude the prelate. When the King came to
church, and &s;aw the pulpit occupied by Couper, he
called to him from his &s;eat, and told him, that the
place was de&s;tined for another; yet &s;ince he was there, if
<PB N="318" REF="351">
he would obey the charge given, and remember the
Queen in his prayers, he might proceed to divine
&s;ervice. The preacher replied, that he would do as
the &s;pirit of God &s;hould direct him. This an&s;wer,
&s;ufficiently in&s;tructed James in his purpo&s;e; and he
commanded him to leave the pulpit. As Couper
&s;eemed not di&s;po&s;ed to obey, the captain of the guard
went to pull him from his place; upon which the
young man cried aloud, that this day would be a
witne&s;s again&s;t the King in the great day of the Lord;
and he denounced a woe upon the inhabitants of Edin|burgh
for permitting him to be treated in that man|ner<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 354.</NOTE>. The audience at fir&s;t appeared de&s;irous to take
part with him; but the &s;ermon of the prelate brought
them over to a more dutiful and more humane di&s;|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH,
when &s;ollicited, either by James or
by foreign princes, to pardon the Queen of Scots,
&s;eemed always determined to proceed to extremities
again&s;t her: But when her mini&s;ters urged her to
interpo&s;e no more delays in the execution, her &s;cruples
and her he&s;itation returned; her humanity could not
allow her to embrace &s;uch violent and &s;anguinary
mea&s;ures; and &s;he was touched with compa&s;&s;ion for
the misfortunes, and with re&s;pect for the dignity, of
the unhappy pri&s;oner. The courtiers, &s;en&s;ible that
they could do nothing more acceptable to her, than
to employ per&s;ua&s;ion on this head, failed not to enforce
every motive for the puni&s;hment of Mary, and to com|bat
all the objections urged again&s;t that act of ju&s;tice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons for the execution of Mary.</NOTE>
They &s;aid, that the treatment of that prince&s;s in Eng|gland
had been, on her fir&s;t reception, &s;uch as &s;ound
rea&s;on and policy required; and if &s;he had been govern|ed
by principles of equity, &s;he would not have re|fu&s;ed
willingly to acquie&s;ce in it: That the obvious
<PB N="319" REF="352">
inconveniences, either of allowing her to retire into
France, or of re&s;toring her by force to her throne,
in oppo&s;ition to the prote&s;tants, and the Engli&s;h party
in Scotland, had obliged the Queen to detain her in
England, till time &s;hould offer &s;ome opportunity of
&s;erving her, without danger to the kingdom, or to
the prote&s;tant religion: That her u&s;age there had been
&s;uch as became her rank; her own &s;ervants, in con|&s;iderable
numbers, had been permitted to attend her;
exerci&s;e had been allowed her for her health, and all
acce&s;s of company for amu&s;ement; and the&s;e indul|gencies
would, in time, have been carried farther, if
by her &s;ub&s;equent conduct &s;he had appeared worthy
of them: That after &s;he had in&s;tigated the rebellion
of Northumberland, the con&s;piracy of Norfolk, the
bull of excommunication of pope Pius, an inva&s;ion
from Flanders; after &s;he had &s;educed the Queen's
friends, and incited every enemy, foreign or dome&s;tic,
again&s;t her; it became nece&s;&s;ary to treat her as a mo&s;t
dangerous rival, and to render her confinement more
&s;trict and rigorous: That the Queen, notwith&s;tanding
the&s;e repeated provocations, had, in her favour, re|jected
the importunity of her Parliaments, and the
advice of her &s;age&s;t mini&s;ters<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Digges, p. 276. Strype, vol. II. p. 48, 135, 136, 139.</NOTE>; and was &s;till, in hopes
of her amendment, determined to delay coming to
the la&s;t extremity again&s;t her: That Mary, even in
this forlorn condition, retained &s;o high and uncon|querable
a &s;pirit, that &s;he acted as competitor to the
crown, and allowed her partizans every where, and
in their very letters, addre&s;&s;ed to her&s;elf, to treat her
as Queen of England: That &s;he had carried her animo|&s;ity
&s;o far as to encourage the atrocious de&s;ign of
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the Queen; and this crime was unque&s;|tionably
proved upon her, by her own letters, by the
evidence of her &s;ecretaries, and by the dying confe&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="320" REF="353">
of her accomplices: That &s;he was but a titular
Queen, and at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no where any right of
&s;overeignty; much le&s;s in England, where every one
was &s;ubject to the laws, and to Elizabeth, the only true
&s;overeign: That even allowing her to be &s;till the
Queen's equal in rank and dignity, &s;elf-defence was
permitted by a law of nature, which could never be abro|gated;
and every one, &s;till more a Queen, had &s;uffi|cient
juri&s;diction over an enemy, who by open violence,
and &s;till more, who by &s;ecret treachery, threatned
the utmo&s;t danger again&s;t her life: That the general
combination of the catholics to exterminate the pro|te&s;tants,
was no longer a &s;ecret; and as the &s;ole re|&s;ource
of the latter per&s;ecuted &s;ect lay in Elizabeth, &s;o
the chief hope which the former entertained of final
&s;ucce&s;s, con&s;i&s;ted in the per&s;on, and in the title of the
Queen of Scots: That this very circum&s;tance brought
matters to extremity between the&s;e prince&s;&s;es, and
rendering the life of the one the death of the other,
pointed out to Elizabeth the path, which either regard
to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, or to the happine&s;s of her people,
&s;hould direct her to follow: And that nece&s;&s;ity, more
powerful than policy, thus demanded of the Queen,
that re&s;olution which equity would authorize, and
which duty pre&s;cribed<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 533.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN Elizabeth thought that as many importuni|ties
had been u&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1587.</NOTE> and as much delay interpo&s;ed, as
decency required, &s;he at la&s;t determined to carry the
&s;entence into execution: But even in this la&s;t re&s;olution
&s;he could not proceed without di&s;playing a new &s;cene
of duplicity and artifice. In order to alarm the vulgar,
rumours were previou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed, that the Spani&s;h
fleet was arrived in Milford Haven; that the Scots
had made an irruption into England; that the duke
of Gui&s;e was landed in Su&s;&s;ex with a &s;trong army;
that the Queen of Scots was e&s;caped from pri&s;on,
<PB N="321" REF="354">
and had rai&s;ed an army; that the northern counties had
begun an in&s;urrection; that there was a new con&s;pira|cy
on foot to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the Queen, and &s;et the city of
London on fire; nay, that the Queen was actually
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 533.</NOTE>. A criminal attempt of this nature was
even imputed to L'Aube&s;pine, the French amba&s;&s;ador;
and that mini&s;ter was obliged to leave the kingdom.
The Queen, affecting to be in great terror and per|plexity,
was ob&s;erved to &s;it much alone, pen&s;ive and
&s;ilent, and &s;ometimes to mutter to her&s;elf half &s;enten|ces,
importing the difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s to which &s;he
was reduced<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 534.</NOTE>. She at la&s;t called Davi&s;on, a man of
parts, but ea&s;y to be impo&s;ed on, and who had lately,
for that very rea&s;on, been made &s;ecretary; and &s;he or|dered
him, to draw out &s;ecretly a warrant for the exe|cution
of the Queen of Scots; which, &s;he afterwards
&s;aid, &s;he intended to keep by her, in ca&s;e any attempt
&s;hould be made for the delivery of that prince&s;s. She
&s;igned the warrant; and then commanded Davi&s;on to
carry it to the chancellor, in order to have the &s;eal af|fixed
to it. Next day &s;he &s;ent Killigrew to Davi&s;on,
enjoining him to forbear &s;ome time executing her for|mer
orders; and when Davi&s;on came and told her, that
the warrant had already pa&s;&s;ed the &s;eals, &s;he &s;eemed to
be &s;omewhat moved, and blamed him for his precipita|tion.
Davi&s;on, being in &s;ome perplexity, acquainted
the council with this whole tran&s;action; and they en|deavoured
to per&s;uade him to &s;end off Beale, clerk of
the council, with the warrant: If the Queen &s;hould be
di&s;plea&s;ed, they promi&s;ed to ju&s;tify his conduct, and to
take on them&s;elves the whole blame of this mea&s;ure<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">It appears by &s;ome letters publi&s;hed by Strype, vol. III. book ii. c. 1. that Elizabeth had not expre&s;sly communicated her intention to any of her mini&s;ters, not even to Burleigh: They were &s;uch experienced courtiers, that they knew they could not gratify her more than by &s;erving her with|out waiting till &s;he de&s;ired them.</NOTE>.

The &s;ecretary, not perceiving their intention, compli|ed
with the advice, and the warrant was di&s;patched to
the earls of Shrew&s;bury and Kent, and &s;ome others,
ordering them to &s;ee the &s;entence executed upon the
Queen of Scots.</P>
<P>THE two earls came to Fotheringay;<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th Februa|ry.</NOTE> and being in|troduced
to Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The execu|tion.</NOTE> informed her of their commi&s;&s;ion,
and told her to prepare for death next morning at eight
o' clock. She &s;eem'd not terrifyed, tho' &s;omewhat &s;ur|prized,
with the intelligence. She &s;aid, with a chear|ful,
and even a &s;miling countenance, that &s;he did not
think the Queen, her &s;i&s;ter, would have con&s;ented to
her death, or have executed the &s;entence again&s;t a per|&s;on
who was not &s;ubject to the laws and juri&s;diction of
England. &startq;But as &s;uch is her will,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,

the two noblemen, that they would permit &s;ome of her
&s;ervants, and particularly her confe&s;&s;or, to attend her:
But they told her, that compliance with this la&s;t de|mand
was contrary to their con&s;cience<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 302.</NOTE>, and that Dr.
Fletcher, dean of Peterborow, a man of great learning,
&s;hould be pre&s;ent, to in&s;truct her in the principles of
true religion. Her refu&s;al to have any conference with
this divine inflamed the earl of Kent's zeal; and he
bluntly told her, that her death would be the life of their
religion; as, on the contrary, her life would have
been the death of it. Mention being made of Babing|ton,
&s;he con&s;tantly denied his con&s;piracy to have been
at all known to her; and the revenge of her wrong, &s;he
re&s;igned into the hands of the Almighty.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="356">
WHEN the earls had left her &s;he ordered &s;upper to
be ha&s;tened, that &s;he might have the more lei&s;ure to fi|ni&s;h
the few affairs which remained to her in this
world, and to prepare for her pa&s;&s;age to another. It
was nece&s;&s;ary for her, &s;he &s;aid, to take &s;ome &s;u&s;tenance,
le&s;t a failure of her bodily &s;trength &s;hould depre&s;s her
&s;pirits on the morrow, and le&s;t her behaviour &s;hould
thereby betray a weakne&s;s unworthy of her&s;elf<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Jebb, p. 489.</NOTE>. She
&s;upped &s;paringly, as her manner u&s;ually was; and her
wonted chearfulne&s;s did not even de&s;ert her on this oc|ca&s;ion.
She comforted her &s;ervants under the afflic|tion
which overwhelmed them, and which was too
powerful for them to conceal from her. Turning to
Burgoin, her phy&s;ician, &s;he a&s;ked him, whether he did
not remark the great and invincible force of truth.
&startq;They pretend,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;that I mu&s;t die, be|cau&s;e
I con&s;pired again&s;t the Queen's life: But the
earl of Kent avowed, that there was no other cau&s;e
of my death, but the apprehen&s;ions, which, if I
&s;hould live, they entertain for their religion. My
con&s;tancy in the faith is my real crime: The re&s;t is
only a colour, invented by intere&s;ted and de&s;igning
men.&endq; Towards the end of &s;upper, &s;he called in
all her &s;ervants, and drank to them: They pledged
her, in order, on their knees; and craved her pardon
for any pa&s;t neglect of their duty: She deigned, in re|turn,
to a&s;k their pardon for her offences towards them;
and a plentiful effu&s;ion of tears attended this la&s;t &s;o|lemn
farewel, and exchange of mutual forgivene&s;s<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. II. p. 302, 626. Camden, p. 534.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HER care of her &s;ervants was the &s;ole remaining af|fair
which employed her concern in this world. She
peru&s;ed her will, in which &s;he had provided for them
by legacies: She ordered the inventory of her goods,
cloaths, and jewels to be brought her; and &s;he wrote

wrote down the names of tho&s;e to whom &s;he bequeath|ed
each particular: To &s;ome &s;he di&s;tributed money
with her own hands; and &s;he adapted the recompence
to their different degrees of rank and merit. She wrote
al&s;o letters of recommendation for her &s;ervants to the
French King, and to her cou&s;in the duke of Gui&s;e,
whom &s;he made the chief executor of her te&s;tament.
At her wonted time &s;he went to bed, &s;lept &s;ome hours;
and then ri&s;ing, &s;pent the re&s;t of the night in prayer.
Having fore&s;een the difficulty of exerci&s;ing the rites of
her religion, &s;he had had the precaution to obtain a
con&s;ecrated ho&s;te from the hands of Pope Pius, and &s;he
had re&s;erved the u&s;e of it for this la&s;t period of her life.
By this expedient &s;he &s;upplied, as much as &s;he could,
the want of a prie&s;t and confe&s;&s;or, who was refu&s;ed
her<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Jebb, vol. II. p. 489.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the morning &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in a rich
habit of &s;ilk and velvet, the only one which &s;he had
re&s;erved to her&s;elf. She told her maids, that &s;he would
willingly have left them this dre&s;s rather than the plain
garb which &s;he wore the day before: But it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for her to appear at the en&s;uing &s;olemnity in a
decent habit.</P>
<P>THOMAS Andrews, &s;heriff of the county, entered
the room, and informed her, that the hour was come,
and that he mu&s;t attend her to the place of execution.
She replied, that &s;he was ready; and bidding adieu to
her &s;ervants, &s;he leaned on two of Sir Amias Paulet's
guards, becau&s;e of an infirmity in her limbs; and &s;he
followed the &s;heriff with a &s;erene and compo&s;ed a&s;pect.
In pa&s;&s;ing thro' a hall adjoining to her chamber, &s;he
was met by the earls of Shrew&s;bury and Kent, Sir
Amias Paulet, Sir Drue Drury, and many other gen|tlemen
of di&s;tinction. Here &s;he al&s;o found Sir An|drew
Melvil, her &s;teward, who flung him&s;elf on his
<PB N="325" REF="360">
knees before her; and, wringing his hands, cried
aloud: &startq;Ah! madam! unhappy me! What man was
ever before the me&s;&s;enger of &s;uch heavy tidings as I
mu&s;t carry, when I &s;hall return to my native country,
and &s;hall report, that I &s;aw my gracious Queen and
Mi&s;tre&s;s beheaded in England?&endq; His tears prevented
further &s;peech; and Mary too felt her&s;elf moved, more
from &s;ympathy than affliction. &startq;Cea&s;e, my good &s;er|vant,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;cea&s;e to lament: Thou ha&s;t cau&s;e
rather to rejoice than to mourn: For now &s;halt thou
&s;ee the troubles of Mary Stuart receive their long
expected period and completion.&endq; &startq;Know,&endq; con|tinued
&s;he, &startq;good &s;ervant, that all the world at be&s;t
is vanity, and &s;ubject &s;till to more &s;orrow than a
whole ocean of tears is able to bewail. But I pray
thee, carry this me&s;&s;age from me, that I die a true
woman to my religion, and unalterable in my af|fections
to Scotland and to France. Heaven forgive
them, that have long de&s;ired my end, and have thir&s;t|ed
for my blood as the hart panteth after the wa|ter
brooks.&endq; &startq;O God,&endq; added &s;he, &startq;thou that
art the author of truth and truth it&s;elf, thou know|e&s;t
the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of my heart: Thou knowe&s;t,
that I was ever de&s;irous, to pre&s;erve an entire union
between Scotland and England, and to obviate the
&s;ource of all the&s;e fatal di&s;cords. But recommend
me, Melvil, to my &s;on, and tell him, that, notwith|&s;tanding
all my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I have done nothing pre|judicial
to the &s;tate and kingdom of Scotland.&endq;
After the&s;e words, reclining her&s;elf, with weeping eyes,
and face bedewed with tears, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed him. &startq;And
&s;o,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;good Melvil, farewell: Once again,
farewell, good Melvil; and grant the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
thy prayers to thy Queen and mi&s;tre&s;s<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">MS. p. 4. Jebb, vol. II. p. 6$4. Strype, vol. III. p. 384.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>

SHE then turned to the noblemen who attended
her, and made a petition in behalf of her &s;ervants,
that they might be well treated, that they might be
allowed to enjoy the pre&s;ents which &s;he had made
them, and be &s;ent &s;afely into their own country.
Having received a favourable an&s;wer, &s;he moved ano|ther
reque&s;t, that they might be permitted to attend her
at her death: In order, &s;aid &s;he, that their eyes may be|hold,
and their hearts bear witne&s;s, how patiently their
Queen and mi&s;tre&s;s can bear her execution, and how
con&s;tantly &s;he per&s;everes in her attachments to her reli|gion.
The earl of Kent oppo&s;ed this de&s;ire, and told
her, that they would be apt, by their &s;peeches and cries,
both to di&s;turb her&s;elf and the &s;pectators: He was al&s;o
apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t they &s;hould practi&s;e &s;ome &s;uper&s;tition,
unmeet for him to &s;uffer; &s;uch as dipping their hand|kerchiefs
in her blood: For that was the in&s;tance
which he made u&s;e of. &startq;My lord,&endq; &s;aid the
Queen of Scots, &startq;I will give my word (altho' it be
but dead) that they &s;hall not incur any blame in any
of the actions which you have named. But alas!
poor &s;ouls! it would be a great con&s;olation to them
to bid their mi&s;tre&s;s farewel. And I hope,&endq; added
&s;he, &startq;that your mi&s;tre&s;s, being a maiden Queen,
would vouch&s;afe, in regard of womanhood, that I
&s;hould have &s;ome of my own people about me at my
death. I know, that her maje&s;ty hath not given you
any &s;uch &s;trict command, but that you might grant
me a reque&s;t of far greater courte&s;y, even tho' I
were a woman of much inferior rank to that which
I bear.&endq; Finding that the earl of Kent per&s;i&s;ted
&s;till in his refu&s;al, her mind, which had fortified it&s;elf
again&s;t the terrors of death, was affected by this cir|cum&s;tance
of indignity, for which &s;he was not prepared.
I am cou&s;in to your Queen,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;and de|&s;cended
from the blood-royal of Henry the &s;eventh, and
a married Queen of France, and an anointed Queen
of Scotland.&endq; The commi&s;&s;ioners perceiving how
<PB N="327" REF="362">
invidious their ob&s;tinacy would appear, con&s;erred a lit|tle
together, and agreed, that &s;he might carry a few of
her &s;ervants along with her. She made choice of four
men, and two maid-&s;ervants, for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>SHE then pa&s;&s;ed into another hall, where was erected
the &s;caffold, covered with black; and &s;he &s;aw, with an
undi&s;mayed countenance, the two executioners, and
all the preparations of death. The room was crowded
with &s;pectators, and no one was &s;o &s;teeled again&s;t all
&s;entiments of humanity, as not to be moved, when he
reflected on her royal dignity, con&s;idered the &s;urprizing
train of her misfortunes, beheld her mild but inflexible
con&s;tancy, recalled her amiable accompli&s;hments, or
&s;urveyed her beauties, which, tho' faded by years, and
yet more by her afflictions, &s;till di&s;covered them&s;elves
in this fatal moment. Here the warrant for her exe|cution
was read to her; and during this ceremony &s;he
was &s;ilent, but &s;hewed, in her behaviour, an indiffer|ence
and unconcern, as if the bu&s;ine&s;s had no wi&s;e re|garded
her. Before the executioners performed their
office, the dean of Peterborow &s;tepped forth; and tho'
the Queen frequently told him, that he needed not
concern him&s;elf about her, that &s;he was &s;ettled in the
antient catholic and Roman religion, and that &s;he meant
to lay down her life in defence of that faith; he &s;till
thought it his duty to per&s;i&s;t in his lectures and exhor|tations,
and to endeavour her conver&s;ion. The terms,
which he employed, were, under colour of pious in|&s;tructions,
very cruel in&s;ults on her unfortunate &s;ituati|on;
and, be&s;ides their own ab&s;urdity, may be regarded
as the mo&s;t mortifying indignities, to which &s;he was ever
yet expo&s;ed. He told her, that the Queen of England
had in this moment &s;hewn a tender care of her; and
notwith&s;tanding the puni&s;hment ju&s;tly to be inflicted on
her, for her manifold tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, was determined to u&s;e
every expedient for &s;aving her &s;oul from that de&s;truction
<PB N="328" REF="363">
with which it was &s;o nearly threatned; That &s;he was
now &s;tanding upon the brink of eternity, and had no
other means of e&s;caping endle&s;s perdition, but by repent|ing
her of her former wickedne&s;s, by ju&s;tifying the &s;en|tence
pronounced again&s;t her, by acknowleging the
Queen's favours, and by exerting a true and lively faith
in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: That the &s;criptures were the only rule
of doctrine, the merits of Chri&s;t the only means of &s;al|vation;
and, if &s;he tru&s;ted in the inventions or devi|ces
of men, &s;he mu&s;t expect in a moment to fall into
utter darkne&s;s, into a place where &s;hall be weeping,
howling, and gna&s;hing of teeth: That the hand of
death was upon her, the ax was laid to the root of the
tree, the throne of the great judge of heaven was erect|ed,
the book of her life was &s;pre$d wide, and the par|ticular
&s;entence and judgment was ready to be pro|nounced
upon her: And that it was now, during this
important moment, in her choice, either to ri&s;e to the
re&s;urrection of life, and hear that joyful &s;alutation,
<HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father,</HI> or to &s;hare the re&s;urrection
of condemnation, replete with &s;orrow and grief; and to
&s;uffer that dreadful denunciation, <HI>Go, ye cur&s;ed, into ever|la&s;ting
fire</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">MS. p. 8, 9, 10, 11. Strype, vol. III. p. 385.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING this di&s;cour&s;e the Queen could not forbear
&s;ometimes betraying her impatience, by interrupting
the preacher; and the dean, finding that he had pro|fited
nothing by his lecture, at la&s;t bid her change her
opinion, repent her of her former wickedne&s;s, and
&s;ettle her faith upon this ground, that only in Chri&s;t
Je&s;us could &s;he hope to be &s;aved. She an&s;wered,
again and again, with great earne&s;tne&s;s: &startq;Trouble
&startq;not your&s;elf any more about the matter: For I was
born in this religion, I have lived in this religion,
and in this religion I am re&s;olved to die.&endq; Even the
two earls perceived, that it was fruitle&s;s to harra&s;s her
any further with theological di&s;putes; and they order|ed
<PB N="329" REF="364">
the dean to de&s;i&s;t from his un&s;ea&s;onable exhortati|ons,
and to pray for her conver&s;ion. During the
dean's prayer, &s;he employed her&s;elf in private devotion
from the office of the Virgin; and after he had fini&s;h|ed,
&s;he pronounced aloud &s;ome petitions in Engli&s;h,
for the afflicted church, for an end of her own trou|bles,

God, that that prince&s;s might long pro&s;per, and

that in her devotions &s;he made frequent u&s;e of
the crucifix, could not forbear reproving her, for her
attachment to that popi&s;h trumpery, as he termed it;
and he exhorted her to have Chri&s;t in her heart, not in
her hand<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">MS. p. 15. Jebb, vol. II. p. 307, 491, 637.</NOTE>. She replied with pre&s;ence of mind, that it
was difficult to hold &s;uch an object in her hand,
without feeling her heart touched with &s;ome com|punction<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Jebb. ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHE now began, with the aid of her two women,
to di&s;robe her&s;elf; and the executioner al&s;o lent his
hand, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. She &s;miled, and &s;aid, that &s;he
was not accu&s;tomed to undre&s;s her&s;elf before &s;o large
a company, nor to be &s;erved by &s;uch valets. Her
&s;ervants, &s;eeing her in this condition, ready to lay her

her lips, as a &s;ign of impo&s;ing &s;ilence upon them<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jebb, p. 307, 492.</NOTE>;
and having given them her ble&s;&s;ing, de&s;ired them to
pray for her. One of her maids, whom &s;he had ap|pointed
for that purpo&s;e, covered her eyes with a
handkerchief; &s;he laid her&s;elf down, without any &s;ign
of fear or trepidation; and her head was &s;evered from
her body at two &s;trokes by the executioner. He in|&s;tantly
held it up to the &s;pectators, &s;treaming with

<P>THUS died,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mary's cha|racter.</NOTE> in the forty fifth year of her age, and
the nineteenth of her captivity in England, Mary
Queen of Scots; a prince&s;s of great accompli&s;hments
both of body and mind, natural as well as acquired; but
unfortunate in her life, and during one period, very
unhappy in her conduct. The beauties of her per&s;on,
and graces of her air, combined to make her the mo&s;t
amiable of women; and the charms of her addre&s;s
and conver&s;ation aided the impre&s;&s;ion which her lovely
figure made on the hearts of all beholders. Ambi|tious
and active in her temper, yet inclined to chear|fulne&s;s
and &s;ociety; of a lofty &s;pirit, con&s;tant and even
vehement in her purpo&s;e; yet polite, and gentle, and
affable in her demeanor; &s;he &s;eemed to partake only
&s;o much of the male virtues as to render her e&s;timable,
without relinqui&s;hing tho&s;e &s;oft graces which compo&s;e
the proper ornaments of her &s;ex. In order to form a ju&s;t
idea of her character, we mu&s;t &s;et a&s;ide one part of her
conduct, while &s;he abandoned her&s;elf to the guidance
of a profligate man; and mu&s;t con&s;ider the&s;e faults,
whether we admit them to be imprudences or crimes,
as the re&s;ult of an inexplicable, tho' not uncommon,
incon&s;tancy in the human mind, of the frailty of our
nature, of the violence of pa&s;&s;ion, and of the influence,
which &s;ituations, and &s;ometimes momentary incidents,
have on per&s;ons, who&s;e principles are not throughly
confirmed by experience and reflection. Enraged by
the ungrateful conduct of her hu&s;band, &s;educed by the
treacherous coun&s;els of one in whom &s;he repo&s;ed con|fidence,
<PB N="331" REF="368">
tran&s;ported by the violence of her own tem|per,
which never lay &s;ufficiently under the guidance
of di&s;cretion; &s;he was betrayed into actions, which
may, with &s;ome difficulty, be accounted for, but which
admit of no apology, nor even of alleviation. An
enumeration of her qualities might carry the appear|ance
of a panegyric; an account of her conduct mu&s;t,
in &s;ome parts, wear the a&s;pect of a &s;evere &s;atire and
invective.</P>
<P>HER numerous misfortunes, the &s;olitude of her
long and tedious captivity, and the per&s;ecutions to
which &s;he had been expo&s;ed on account of her religi|on,
had wrought her up to a degree of bigotry during
her latter years; and &s;uch was the prevalent &s;pirit and
principles of that age, that it is the le&s;s wonder, if her
zeal, her re&s;entment, and her intere&s;t uniting, induced
her to give con&s;ent to a de&s;ign, which con&s;pirators,
actuated only by the fir&s;t of the&s;e motives, had formed
again&s;t the life of Elizabeth.</P>
<P>WHEN the Queen heard of Mary's execution, &s;he
affected the utmo&s;t &s;urprize and indignation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's affected &s;or|row.</NOTE> Her
countenance changed, her &s;peech faltered and failed
her, and for a long time, her &s;orrow was &s;o deep that
&s;he could not expre&s;s it, but &s;tood fixed, like a &s;tatue,
in &s;ilence and mute a&s;toni&s;hment. After her grief was
able to find vent, it bur&s;t out in loud wailings and
lamentations; &s;he put her&s;elf into deep mourning for
this deplorable event; and &s;he was &s;een perpetually
bathed in tears, and &s;urrounded only by her maids
and women. None of her mini&s;ters or councellors
dared to approach her; or if any a&s;&s;umed &s;uch temeri|ty,
&s;he chaced them from her, with the mo&s;t violent
expre&s;&s;ions of rage and re&s;entment: They had all of
them been guilty of an unpardonable crime, in put|ting
to death her dear &s;i&s;ter and kin&s;woman, con|trary

they were &s;ufficiently apprized and acquainted.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was her &s;orrow &s;o much abated as to
leave room for reflexion, than &s;he wrote a letter of
apology to the King of Scots, and &s;ent it by Sir
Robert Cary, &s;on to lord Hun&s;don. She there told him,
that &s;he wi&s;hed he knew, but not felt, the unutterable
grief of mind, &s;he experienced, on account of that la|mentable
accident, which, without her knowledge,
much le&s;s concurrence, had happened in England:
That as her pen trembled, when &s;he attempted to
write it, &s;he found her&s;elf obliged to commit the re|lation
of it to the me&s;&s;enger, her kin&s;man; who would
likewi&s;e inform his maje&s;ty of every circum&s;tance,
which attended this di&s;mal and unlooked for misfor|tune:
That &s;he appealed to the Supreme Judge of
heaven and earth for her innocence; and was al&s;o &s;o
happy, amid&s;t her other afflictions, as to find, that
many per&s;ons in her court could bear witne&s;s to her
veracity in this prote&s;tation: That &s;he abhorred hy|pocri&s;y
and di&s;&s;imulation, deemed nothing more wor|thy
of a prince than a &s;incere and open conduct, and
could never &s;urely be e&s;teemed &s;o ba&s;e and poor-&s;pirited,
as that, if &s;he had really given orders for this fatal
execution, &s;he could, on any con&s;ideration, be induc|ed
to deny them: That tho' &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of the
ju&s;tice of the &s;entence, &s;he determined from clemen|cy
never to carry it into execution; and could not
but re&s;ent the temerity of tho&s;e, who on this occa&s;ion
had di&s;appointed her intention: And that as no one
loved him more dearly than her&s;elf, or bore a more
anxious concern for his welfare; &s;he hoped, that he
would con&s;ider every one as his enemy, who endea|voured,
on account of the pre&s;ent incident, to excite
any animo&s;ity between them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 536. Spot&s;wood, p. 358.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="370">
IN order the better to appea&s;e James, &s;he commit|ted
Davi&s;on to pri&s;on, and ordered him to be tried in
the Star-Chamber, for his mi&s;demeanour. The &s;ecre|tary
was confounded; and being &s;en&s;ible of the danger,
which mu&s;t attend his entering into a conte&s;t with
the Queen, he expre&s;&s;ed penitence for his error, and
&s;ubmitted very patiently to be railed at by tho&s;e very
coun&s;ellors, who&s;e per&s;ua&s;ion had induced him to in|cur
the guilt, and who had promi&s;ed to countenance
and protect him. He was condemned to impri&s;on|ment
during the Queen's plea&s;ure, and to pay a fine
of ten thou&s;and pounds. He remained a long time
in cu&s;tody; and the fine, tho' it reduced him to want
and beggary, was rigorou&s;ly levied upon him. All
the favour, which he could obtain from the Queen,
was the &s;ending him &s;mall &s;upplies from time to time,
to keep him from peri&s;hing in nece&s;&s;ity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 538.</NOTE>. He privately
wrote an apology to his friend Wal&s;ingham, which
contains many curious particulars: The French and
Scots amba&s;&s;adors, he &s;aid, had been remon&s;trating
with the Queen in Mary's behalf; and immediately
after their departure, &s;he commanded him, of her own
accord, to deliver her the warrant for the execution of
that prince&s;s. She &s;igned it readily and ordered it to
be &s;ealed with the great &s;eal of England. She appeared
in &s;uch good humour on the occa&s;ion, that &s;he &s;aid to
him in a jocular manner, &startq;Go tell all this to Wal|&s;ingham,
who is now &s;ick: Tho' I fear he will die
for &s;orrow, when he hears it.&endq; She added, that,
tho' &s;he had &s;o long delayed the execution, le&s;t &s;he
&s;hould &s;eem to be actuated by malice or cruelty, &s;he
was all along &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of it. In the
&s;ame conver&s;ation, &s;he blamed Drury and Paulet, that
they had not before ea&s;ed her of this trouble; and &s;he
expre&s;&s;ed her de&s;ire that Wal&s;ingham would bring them
<PB N="334" REF="371">
to a compliance in that particular. She was &s;o bent on
this purpo&s;e that, &s;ome time after, &s;he a&s;ked Davi&s;on,
whether any letter had come from Paulet with regard
to the &s;ervice expected of him. Davi&s;on &s;howed her
Paulet's letter; in which that gentleman flatly refu&s;ed
to act any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of
honour and ju&s;tice. The Queen fell into a pa&s;&s;ion,
and accu&s;ed Paulet, as well as Drury, of perjury,
that, having taken the oath of a&s;&s;ociation, in which they
had bound them&s;elves to avenge her wrongs, they had
yet refu&s;ed to lend their hand on this occa&s;ion. &startq;But
others,&endq; &s;he &s;aid, &startq;will be found le&s;s &s;crupulous.&endq;
Davi&s;on adds, that nothing but the con&s;ent and ex|hortations
of the whole council could have engaged
him to &s;end off the warrant. He was well aware of his
danger; and remembered, that the Queen, after having
ordered the execution of the duke of Norfolk, had
endeavoured, in like manner, to throw the whole
blame and odium of that action upon lord Burleigh<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 538. Strype, vol. III. p. 375, 376. MS. in the Ad|vocate's library, A. 3. 28. p. 17. from the Cott. Lib. Calig. c. 9. Biogr. Brit. p. 1625, 1627.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH'S di&s;&s;imulation was &s;o gro&s;s, that it could
deceive no body who was not previou&s;ly re&s;olved to
be blinded; but as James's concern for this mother
was certainly more &s;incere and cordial, he di&s;covered
the highe&s;t re&s;entment, and refu&s;ed to admit Cary into
his pre&s;ence. He recalled his amba&s;&s;adors from Eng|land;
and &s;eemed to breathe nothing but war and ven|geance.
The States of Scotland, being a&s;&s;embled,
entered into the quarrel, and profe&s;&s;ed that they were
ready to &s;pend their lives and fortunes in revenge of his
mother's death, and in defence of his title to the crown
of England. Many of his nobility in&s;tigated him
to take arms: Lord Sinclair, when the courtiers ap|peared
in deep mourning, pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the King
arrayed in compleat armour, and &s;aid, that that was
<PB N="335" REF="372">
the proper mourning for the Queen. The catholics
took the opportunity of exhorting James to ally him|&s;elf
with the King of Spain, to lay immediate claim
to the crown of England, and to prevent the danger,
which, from his mother's example, he might conclude,
would certainly, if Elizabeth's power prevailed, over|whelm
his per&s;on and his kingdom. The Queen was
&s;en&s;ible of the danger attending the&s;e coun&s;els; and,
after allowing James &s;ome decent interval to vent his
grief and anger, &s;he employed her emi&s;&s;aries to pacify
him, and to &s;et before him every motive of hope or
fear, which might induce him to live in peace and
friend&s;hip with her.</P>
<P>WALSINGHAM wrote to lord Thirl&s;tone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th March.</NOTE> the Scots
&s;ecretary of &s;tate, a very judicious letter to the &s;ame
purpo&s;e. He &s;aid, that he was much &s;urprized to hear
of the violent re&s;olutions taken in Scotland, and of the
pa&s;&s;ion di&s;covered by a prince of &s;o much judgment and
temper as James: That a war, founded merely on the
principle of revenge, and that too on account of an act
of Ju&s;tice, which nece&s;&s;ity had extorted, would for ever
be expo&s;ed to blame, and could not be excu&s;ed by any
principles of equity or rea&s;on: That if the&s;e views
were deemed le&s;s momentous among princes, policy and
intere&s;t ought certainly to be attended to; and the&s;e mo|tives
did &s;till more evidently oppo&s;e all thoughts of a
rupture with England, and all revival of exploded
claims and preten&s;ions to the Engli&s;h throne: That the
inequality between the two kingdoms deprived James
of any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, if he tru&s;ted merely to the force
of his own &s;tate, and had no recour&s;e to foreign powers
for a&s;&s;i&s;tance: That the objections, attending the in|troduction
of &s;uccours from a more powerful monarch,
appeared &s;o evident from all the tran&s;actions of hi&s;tory,
that they could not e&s;cape a per&s;on of the King's ex|ten&s;ive
knowledge; but there were, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e,
<PB N="336" REF="373">
&s;everal peculiar circum&s;tances, which ought for ever to
prevent him from having recour&s;e to &s;o dangerous an
expedient: That the French monarch, the antient ally
of Scotland, might willingly u&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that
kingdom again&s;t England; but would be di&s;plea&s;ed to
&s;ee the union of the&s;e two crowns on the head of
James; an union, which would ever after exclude him
from all hopes of practicing that policy, formerly &s;o
u&s;eful to France and &s;o pernicious to the Scotti&s;h nati|on:
That Henry, be&s;ides, infe&s;ted with faction and do|me&s;tic
war, was not in a condition of &s;upporting di&s;|tant
allies; much le&s;s, would he undergo any hazard or
expence, in order to aggrandize a near kin&s;man to the
hou&s;e of Gui&s;e, the mo&s;t determined enemies of his re|po&s;e
and authority: That the exten&s;ive power and ex|orbitant
ambition of the Spani&s;h monarch rendered him
a &s;till more dangerous ally to James; and as he evi|dently
a&s;pired to an univer&s;al monarchy in the we&s;t,
and had in particular advanced &s;ome claims on En|gland,
as if he were de&s;cended from the hou&s;e of Lan|ca&s;ter,
he was at the &s;ame time the common enemy of
all princes, who d$$$ed maintain their liberty and in|dependence;
and the immediate rival and competitor
of the King of Scots: That the Queen, by her own
naval power$ and her alliance with the Hollanders,
would probably intercept all &s;uccours which might be
&s;ent James from abroad, and be enabled to decide the
controver&s;y in this i&s;land with the &s;uperior forces of
her own kingdom, oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e of Scotland: That
if the King revived his mother's preten&s;ions to the
crown of England, he mu&s;t al&s;o embrace her religion, by
which alone they could be ju&s;tified; and mu&s;t thereby
undergo the infamy of abandoning tho&s;e principles, in
which he had been &s;trictly educated, and to which he
had hitherto religiou&s;ly adhered: That as he would, by
&s;uch an apo&s;ta&s;y, totally alienate all the prote&s;tants in
<PB N="337" REF="374">
Scotland and England, he could never gain the confi|dence
of the catholics, who would &s;till entertain a very
rea&s;onable doubt of his honour and &s;incerity: That by
advancing a pre&s;ent claim to the crown, he forfeited
the certain pro&s;pect of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and revived that
national animo&s;ity, which the late peace and alliance
between the kingdoms had happily extingui&s;hed: That
the whole gentry and nobility of England had openly
declared them&s;elves for the execution of the Queen of
Scots; and if James &s;howed &s;uch violent re&s;entment
again&s;t that act of ju&s;tice, they would be obliged, for
their own &s;ecurity, to prevent for ever &s;o implacable
and revenge$$l a prince from ruling over them: And
that, h$$ever &s;ome per&s;ons might repre&s;ent his honour
as engaged to &s;eek vengeance for the pre&s;ent affront and
injury, the true honour of a prince con&s;i&s;ted in wi&s;dom
and moderation and ju&s;tice, not in following the dic|tates
of blind pa&s;&s;ion, or in pur&s;uing revenge at the ex|pence
of every motive and every intere&s;t<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 377. Spot&s;wood.</NOTE>. The&s;e con|&s;iderations,
joined to the peace$ $word$ unambitious tem|per
of the young prince, pre$$ $ver his re&s;entment;
and he fell gradually into a good corre&s;pondence with
the court of England. It is probable, that the Queen's
chief object in her di&s;&s;imulation with regard to the ex|ecution
of Mary, was, that &s;he might thereby afford
James a decent pretence for renewing his amity with
her, on which their mutual intere&s;ts &s;o much depend|ed.</P>

he burned about an hundred ve&s;&s;els, laden with am|munition

he &s;et &s;ail for the Tercera I&s;lands, with an in|tention
of lying in wait for a rich Carrack, which was

<P>THE land enterprizes of the Engli&s;h were not, dur|ing

of twelve hundred Engli&s;h; and this gentleman,
being a catholic, was alarmed with the di&s;covery of
Babington's con&s;piracy, and became apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t
every one of his religion &s;hould thenceforth be treated
with di&s;tru&s;t in England. He entered into a corre&s;pon|dence
with the Spaniards, betrayed the city to them for
a &s;um of money, and engaged the whole garri&s;on to
de&s;ert with him to the Spani&s;h &s;ervice. Roland York,
who commanded a fort near Zutphen, imitated his
example; and the Hollanders, formerly di&s;gu&s;ted with
Leice&s;ter, and &s;u&s;picious of the Engli&s;h, broke out into
loud complaints again&s;t the improvidence, if not the
treachery of his admini&s;tration. Soon after, he him|&s;elf
arrived in the Low Countries; but his conduct was
no-wi&s;e calculated to give them &s;atisfaction, or to re|move
the &s;u&s;picions, which they had entertained
again&s;t him. The prince of Parma having be&s;ieged
Sluys, he attempted to relieve the place, fir&s;t by &s;ea,
then by land; but failed in both enterprizes; and as he
a&s;cribed his bad &s;ucce&s;s to the ill behaviour of the Hol|landers,
they were equally free in reflections upon his
conduct. The breach between them became wider

every day: They &s;lighted his authority, oppo&s;ed his
mea&s;ures, and neglected his coun&s;els; while he endea|voured,
by an imperious behaviour, and by violence,
to recover that influence, which he had lo&s;t by his im|prudent
and ill concerted mea&s;ures. He was even
&s;u&s;pected by the Dutch of a de&s;ign to u&s;urp upon their
liberties; and the jealou&s;y entertained again&s;t him, be|gan
to extend towards the Queen her&s;elf. That prin|ce&s;s
had made &s;ome advances towards a peace with
Spain: A congre&s;s had been opened at Bourbourg, a
village near Graveline: And tho' the two courts, e&s;|pecially
that of Spain, had no other intention than to
amu&s;e each of them its enemy by negotiation, and mu|tually
relax the preparations for defence or a&s;&s;ault, the
Dutch, who were determined, on no condition, to re|turn
under the Spani&s;h yoke, became apprehen&s;ive le&s;t
their liberty &s;hould be &s;acrificed to the political inter|e&s;ts
of England<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, part II. lib. 4. Strype, vol, IV, N^o 246.</NOTE>. But the Queen, who knew the im|portance
of her alliance with the &s;tates in the pre&s;ent
conjuncture, was re&s;olved to give them entire &s;atisfac|tion
by recalling Leice&s;ter, and commanding him to re|&s;ign
his government. Maurice, &s;on to the prince of
Orange, a youth of twenty years of age, was elected
by the &s;tates governor in his place; and Peregrine lord
Willoughby, was appointed by the Queen commander
of the Engli&s;h forces. The mea&s;ures of the&s;e two ge|nerals
were much retarded by the malignity of Leice&s;|ter,
who had left a faction behind him, and who &s;till at|tempted,
by means of his emi&s;&s;aries, to di&s;turb all the
operations of the &s;tates. So &s;oon as Elizabeth got in|telligence
of the&s;e di&s;orders, &s;he took care to redre&s;s
them, and &s;he obliged all the partizans of England to
fall into unanimity with prince Maurice<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 66.</NOTE>. But tho'
her good &s;en&s;e &s;o far prevailed over her partiality to Lei|ce&s;ter,
&s;he never could be made fully &s;en&s;ible of his vi|ces
<PB N="341" REF="382">
and incapacity: The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, which he made
her, re&s;tored him to her wonted
favour; and the lord
Buckhur&s;t, who had accu&s;ed him of mi&s;conduct in Hol|land,
lo&s;t for &s;ome time her confidence, and was even
committed to cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>SIR Chri&s;topher Hatton was another favourite, who,
at this time, received &s;ome marks of her partiality. Tho'
he had never followed the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, he was
made chancellor in the place of Bromley, decea&s;ed; but
notwith&s;tanding all the expectations and wi&s;hes of the
lawyers, he behaved in a manner not unworthy that
high &s;tation: His good natural capacity &s;upplied the
place of experience and &s;tudy; and his deci&s;ions were
not found deficient either in point of equity or judg|ment.
His enemies had contributed to this promotion,
in hopes that his ab&s;ence from court, while he attend|ed
the bu&s;ine&s;s of chancery, would gradually e&s;trange
him from the Queen, and give them an opportunity of
undermining him in her favour.</P>
<P>THESE little intrigues and cabals of the court were
&s;ilenced by the account, which came from all quarters,
of the va&s;t preparations made by the Spaniards for the
inva&s;ion of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1588.</NOTE> and for the entire conque&s;t of
that kingdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip pro|jects the in|va&s;ion of En|gland.</NOTE> Philip, tho' he had not yet declared
war, on account of the ho&s;tilities, which Elizabeth eve|ry
where committed upon him, had long harboured a
&s;ecret and violent de&s;ire of revenge again&s;t her. His
ambition al&s;o and the hopes of extending his empire
were much encouraged by the pre&s;ent pro&s;perous &s;itu|ation
of his affairs; by the conque&s;t of Portugal, the
acqui&s;ition of the Indian commerce and &s;ettlements, and
the yearly importation of va&s;t trea&s;ures from America.
The point on which he re&s;ted his highe&s;t glory, the
perpetual object of his policy, was to &s;upport orthodoxy
and exterminate here&s;y; and as the power and credit
of Elizabeth were the chief bulwark of the prote&s;tants,
he hoped, if he could &s;ubdue that prince&s;s, to acquire
<PB N="342" REF="383">
the eternal renown, of being able to reunite the whole
Chri&s;tian world in the catholic communion. Above
all, his indignation again&s;t his revolted &s;ubjects in the
Netherlands, in&s;tigated him to attack the Engli&s;h, who
had encouraged that in&s;urrection, and who, by their
near neighbourhood, were &s;o well enabled to &s;upport the
Hollanders, that he could never hope to reduce the&s;e
rebels, while the power of that kingdom remained en|tire
and unbroken. To &s;ubdue England &s;eemed a ne|ce&s;&s;ary
preparative to the ree&s;tabli&s;hment of his autho|rity
in the Netherlands; and notwith&s;tanding all ap|pearances,
the former was in it&s;elf, as a more important,
&s;o a more ea&s;y, undertaking than the latter. That
kingdom lay nearer Spain than the Low Countries,
and was more expo&s;ed to inva&s;ion from that quarter;
after an enemy had once obtained entrance, it was nei|ther
fortified by art nor nature; a long peace had de|prived
it of all military di&s;cipline and experience; and
the catholics, in which it &s;till abounded, would be rea|dy,
it was hoped, to join any invader, who &s;hould free
them from tho&s;e grievous per&s;ecutions, at pre&s;ent exer|ci&s;ed
again&s;t them, and revenge the death of the Queen
of Scots, on whom they had fixed all their affections.
The fate of England mu&s;t be decided in one battle at
&s;ea, and another at land; and what compari&s;on between
the Engli&s;h and Spaniards, either in point of naval
force, or in the numbers, reputation, and veteran bra|very
of their armies? Be&s;ides the acqui&s;ition of &s;o great
a kingdom, &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t England en&s;ured the imme|diate
&s;ubjection of the Hollanders, who, attacked on
every hand, and deprived of all &s;upport, mu&s;t yield their
&s;tubborn necks to that yoke, which they had &s;o long
re&s;i&s;ted. Happily this conque&s;t, as it was of the ut|mo&s;t
importance to the grandeur of Spain, would not
at pre&s;ent be oppo&s;ed by the jealou&s;y of the neighbour|ing
powers, naturally &s;o much intere&s;ted to prevent the
&s;ucce&s;s of that enterprize. A truce was lately conclud|ed
<PB N="343" REF="384">
with the Turks; the empire was in the hands of a
friend and near ally; and France, the perpetual rival
of Spain, was &s;o torn with inte&s;tine commotions, that
&s;he had no leizure to pay attention to her foreign inter|e&s;ts.
This favourable opportunity, therefore, which
might never again pre&s;ent it&s;elf, mu&s;t be &s;eized; and
one bold effort made for acquiring that a&s;cendant in Eu|rope,
to which the pre&s;ent greatne&s;s and pro&s;perity of
the Spaniards &s;eemed &s;o fully to intitle them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden. Strype, vol. III. p. 512.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE hopes and motives engaged Philip, notwith|&s;tanding
his cautious temper, to undertake this hazard|ous
enterprize; and tho' the duke of Parma, when
con&s;ulted, oppo&s;ed the attempt, at lea&s;t repre&s;ented the
nece&s;&s;ity of previou&s;ly getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome &s;ea|port
town in the Netherlands, which might afford a
retreat to the Spani&s;h navy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglio, part II. lib. 4.</NOTE>, it was determined by the
catholic monarch, to procced immediately to the exe|cution
of his ambitious projects. During &s;ome time
he had been &s;ecretly making preparations; but &s;o &s;oon
as the re&s;olution was fully taken, every part of his
va&s;t empire re&s;ounded with noi&s;e of armaments, and
all his mini&s;ters, generals, and admirals, were employ|ed
in forwarding the de&s;ign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The invinci|ble Armada.</NOTE> The marqui&s;s of Santa
Croce, a &s;ea officer of great reputation and experience,
was de&s;tined to command the fleet; and by his coun&s;el
were the naval equipments conducted. In all the ports
of Sicily, of Naples, of Spain and Portugal, artizans
were employed in building ve&s;&s;els of uncommon &s;ize
and force; naval &s;tores were bought at a prodigious ex|pence;
provi&s;ions ama&s;&s;ed; armies levied and quartered
in the maritime towns of Spain; and plans laid for
fitting out &s;uch a fleet and embarkation as had never
before had its equal in Europe. The military prepara|tions
in Flanders were no le&s;s formidable. Troops
from all quarters were every moment a&s;&s;embling, to
reinforce the duke of Parma. Capizuchi and Spinelli,
<PB N="344" REF="385">
conducted forces from Italy: The marque&s;s of Borgaut,
a prince of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, levied troops in Ger|many:
The Walloon and Burgundian regiments were
compleated or augmented: The Spani&s;h infantry was
&s;upplied with recruits; and an army of thirty four
thou&s;and men were a&s;&s;embled in the Netherlands, and
kept in a readine&s;s to be tra&s;ported into England. The
duke of Parma employed all the carpenters whom he
could procure, either in Flanders or in Lower Ger|many,
and the coa&s;ts of the Baltic; and he built at
Dunkirk, and Newport, but e&s;pecially at Antwerp,
a great number of boats and flat bottomed ve&s;&s;els, for
the tran&s;portation of his infantry and cavalry into
England. The mo&s;t renowned nobility and princes of
Italy and Spain were ambitious of &s;haring in the honour
of this great enterprize. Don Amadaus of Savoy,
Don John of Medicis, Ve&s;pa&s;ian Gonzaga, duke of
Sabionetta, and the duke of Pa&s;trana, ha&s;tened to join
the army under the duke of Parma. About two thou|&s;and
volunteers, many of them men of family, had
inli&s;ted in the &s;ervice in Spain. No doubt was en|tertained,
but &s;uch va&s;t preparations, conducted by
officers of &s;uch con&s;ummate &s;kill, mu&s;t finally be &s;uc|ce&s;sful.
And the Spaniards, o&s;tentatious of their
power, and elevated with vain hopes, had already deno|minated
their navy the <HI>Invincible Armada.</HI></P>
<P>NEWS of the&s;e extraordinary preparations &s;oon reach|ed
England; and notwith&s;tanding the &s;ecrecy of the
Spani&s;h council, and their pretending to employ this
force in the Indies, it was ea&s;ily concluded, that they
meant to make &s;ome effort again&s;t England. The
Queen had fore&s;een the inva&s;ion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations in England.</NOTE> and finding that
&s;he mu&s;t now contend for her crown with the whole
force of Spain, &s;he made preparations for re&s;i&s;tance;
nor was &s;he terrified with that power, by which all
Europe apprehended &s;he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be over|whelmed.
Her force indeed &s;eemed very unequal to
<PB N="345" REF="386">
re&s;i&s;t &s;o potent an enemy. All the &s;ailors in England
amounted at that time only to fourteen thou&s;and two
hundred and ninety-five men<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 256.</NOTE>. The &s;ize of the Engli&s;h
&s;hipping was, in general, &s;o &s;mall, that, except a few
of the Queen's &s;hips of war, there were not four ve&s;&s;els
belonging to the merchants which exceeded four hun|dred
tuns<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 268.</NOTE>. The royal navy con&s;i&s;ted only of twenty|eight
ve&s;&s;els<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 157.</NOTE>, many of which were of very &s;mall &s;ize;
none of them exceeding the bulk of our large&s;t frigates,
and mo&s;t of them de&s;erving rather the name of pinnaces
than of &s;hips. The only advantage of the Engli&s;h fleet,
con&s;i&s;ted in the dexterity and courage of the &s;eamen,
who being accu&s;tomed to &s;ail in tempe&s;tuous &s;eas, and
expo&s;e them&s;elves to all dangers, as much exceeded
in this particular the Spani&s;h mariners, as their ve&s;&s;els
were inferior in &s;ize and force to tho&s;e of that nation<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 321.</NOTE>.
All the commercial towns of England were required
to furni&s;h &s;hips for reinforcing this &s;mall navy; and
they di&s;covered, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, great alacrity
in defending their liberty and religion again&s;t tho&s;e im|minent
perils with which they were menaced. The
citizens of London, in order to &s;hew their vigour in
the common cau&s;e, in&s;tead of fifteen ve&s;&s;els which they
were commanded to equip, voluntarily fitted out double
the number<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 267.</NOTE>. The gentry and nobility hired, and
armed, and manned, forty-three &s;hips at their own
charge<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. 1. p. 451.</NOTE>; and all the loans of money which the Queen
demanded, were frankly granted by the per&s;ons appli|ed
to. Lord Howard of Effingham, a man of great
courage and capacity, was lord admiral, and took on
him the command of the navy: Drake, Hawkins, and
Frobi&s;her, the mo&s;t renowned &s;eamen in Europe,
&s;erved under him. The main fleet was &s;tationed at
Plymouth. A &s;maller &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of forty
ve&s;&s;els, Engli&s;h and Flemi&s;h, was commanded by the
<PB N="346" REF="387">
lord Seymour, &s;econd &s;on of protector Somer&s;et; and lay
off Dunkirk, in order to intercept the duke of Parma.</P>
<P>THE land forces of England, compared to tho&s;e of
Spain, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed contrary qualities to its naval power:
They were more numerous than the enemy, but much
inferior in di&s;cipline, reputation, and experience. An
army of twenty thou&s;and men was di&s;po&s;ed in different
bodies along the &s;outh coa&s;t; and orders were given
them, if they could not hinder the Spaniards from land|ing,
to retire backwards, to wa&s;te the country around,
and to wait for reinforcement from the neighbouring
counties, before they approached the enemy. A body
of twenty-two thou&s;and foot, and a thou&s;and hor&s;e,
under the command of the earl of Leice&s;ter, was
&s;tationed at Tilbury, in order to defend the capital.
The main army, con&s;i&s;ted of thirty-four thou&s;and foot,
and two thou&s;and hor&s;e, and was commanded by lord
Hun&s;don. The&s;e forces were re&s;erved for the guard
of the Queen's per&s;on; and were appointed to march
whither&s;oever the enemy &s;hould appear. The fate of
England, if all the Spani&s;h armies &s;hould be able to
land, &s;eemed to depend on the i&s;&s;ue of a &s;ingle battle;
and men of reflection entertained the mo&s;t di&s;mal ap|prehen&s;ions,
when they con&s;idered the force of fifty
thou&s;and veteran Spaniards, commanded by experien|ced
officers, under the duke of Parma, the mo&s;t con|&s;ummate
general of the age; and compared this formid|able
armament with the military power, which Eng|land,
not enervated by peace, but long di&s;u&s;ed to war,
could mu&s;ter up again&s;t it.</P>
<P>THE chief &s;upport of the kingdom &s;eemed to con|&s;i&s;t
in the vigour and prudence of the Queen's$con|duct;
who, undi&s;mayed by the pre&s;ent dangers, i&s;&s;ued
all her orders with tranquillity, animated her people
to a &s;teddy re&s;i&s;tance, and employed every re&s;ource,
which either her dome&s;tic &s;ituation or her foreign
alliances could afford her. She &s;ent Sir Robert Sydney

into Scotland; and exhorted the King to remain at|tached
to her, and to con&s;ider the danger which at
pre&s;ent menaced his &s;overeignty no le&s;s than her own,
from the ambition of the Spani&s;h tyrant<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">She made him &s;ome promi&s;es which &s;he never fulfilled, to give him a dukedom in England, with &s;uitable lands and revenue, to &s;ettle 50001. a year on him, and pay him a guard, for the &s;afety of his per&s;on. From a MS. of lord Roy&s;ton.</NOTE>: The amba&s;|&s;ador

to march with the force of his whole kingdom
to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Elizabeth. Her authority with
the King of Denmark, and the tye of their common
religion, engaged this prince, upon her application,
to &s;eize a &s;quadron of &s;hips which Philip had bought or
hired in the Dani&s;h harbours<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Strype. vol. III. p. 524.</NOTE>: The Han&s;e Towns,
tho' not at that time on good terms with Elizabeth,
were induced by the &s;ame motives, to retard &s;o long
the equipment of &s;ome ve&s;&s;els in their ports, that they
became u&s;ele&s;s to the purpo&s;e of invading England.
All the prote&s;tants throughout Europe, regarded this
enterprize as the critical event which was to decide
for ever the fate of their religion; and tho' unable, by
rea&s;on of their di&s;tance, to join their force to that
of Elizabeth, they kept their eyes fixed on her con|duct
and fortune, and beheld with anxiety, mixed
with admiration, the interepid countenance with which
&s;he encountered that dreadful tempe&s;t, which was every
moment approaching towards her.</P>
<P>THE Queen al&s;o was &s;en&s;ible, that, next to the gene|ral
popularity which &s;he enjoyed, and the confidence
which her &s;ubjects repo&s;ed in her prudent government,
the firme&s;t &s;upport of her throne con&s;i&s;ted in the general
zeal of the people for the prote&s;tant religion, and the
&s;trong prejudices which they had imbibed again&s;t pope|ry.
She took care, on this occa&s;ion, to revive in the
nation this attachment to their own &s;ect, and this ab|horrence
of the oppo&s;ite. The Engli&s;h were remind|ed
<PB N="348" REF="389">
of their former danger from the tyranny of Spain:
All the barbarities exerci&s;ed by Mary again&s;t the pro|te&s;tants,
were a&s;cribed to the coun&s;els of that bigotted
and imperious nations: The bloody ma&s;&s;acres in the In|dies,
the unrelenting executions in the Low Countries,
the horrid cruelties and iniquities of the inqui&s;ition,
were &s;et before men's eyes: A li&s;t and de&s;cription was
publi&s;hed, and pictures di&s;per&s;ed, of the &s;everal in&s;tru|ments
of torture$ with which, it was pretended, the
Spani&s;h Armada was loaded: And every artifice, as
well as rea&s;on, was employed, to animate the people to
a vigorous defence of their religion, their laws, and their
liberties.</P>
<P>BUT while the Queen, in this critical emergence,
rouzed the animo&s;ity of the nation again&s;t popery, &s;he
treated the partizans of that &s;ect with moderation, and
gave not way to an undi&s;tingui&s;hing fury again&s;t them.
Tho' &s;he knew, that Sixtus Quintus, the pre&s;ent pope,
famous for his capacity and his tyranny, had fulminated
a new bull of excommunication again&s;t her, had depo&s;|ed
her from the throne, had ab&s;olved her &s;ubjects from
their oaths of allegiance, had publi&s;hed a cru&s;ade again&s;t
England, and had granted plenary indulgences to eve|ry
one engaged in the pre&s;ent inva&s;ion; &s;he would not
believe, that all her catholic &s;ubjects could be &s;o blind|ed,
as to &s;acrifice to bigotry their duty to their &s;ove|reign,
and the liberty and independency of their native
country. She rejected all violent coun&s;els, by which
&s;he was prompted to &s;eek pretences for di&s;patching the
leaders of that party: She would not even confine any
con&s;iderable number of them: And the catholics, &s;en|&s;ible
of this good u&s;age, generally expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t
zeal for the public defence. Some gentlemen of that
&s;ect, con&s;cious that they could not ju&s;tly expect any
tru&s;t or authority, entered them&s;elves as volunteers in
the fleet or army<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 747.</NOTE>: Some equipped &s;hips at their own

charge, and gave the command of them to prote&s;tants:
Others were active in animating their tenants and va&s;|&s;als,
and neighbours, to the defence of their country:
And every rank of men, burying for the pre&s;ent all par|ty
di&s;tinctions, &s;eemed to prepare them&s;elves, with or|der
as well as vigour, to re&s;i&s;t the violence of the&s;e in|vaders.</P>
<P>THE
more to excite the martial &s;pirit of the nation,
the Queen appeared on hor&s;eback in the camp at Til|bury;
and riding thro' the lines, di&s;covered a chearful
and animated countenance, exhorted the &s;oldiers to re|member
their duty to their country and their religion,
and profe&s;&s;ed her intention, tho' a woman, to lead them
her&s;elf into the field again&s;t the enemy, and rather to
peri&s;h in battle than &s;urvive the ruin and &s;lavery of her
people<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Queen's &s;peech in the camp of Tilbury was in the&s;e words:</HI> My loving people, We have been per&s;uaded by &s;ome, that are careful of our &s;afety, to take heed how we commit our&s;elves to armed multitudes, for fear of treachery; but a&s;&s;ure you, I do not de&s;ire to live to di&s;tru&s;t my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear: I have always &s;o behaved my&s;elf, that, under God, I have placed my chiefe&s;t &s;trength and &s;afeguard in the loyal hearts and good-will of my &s;ubjects. And therefore I am come among&s;t you at this time, not as for my recreation or &s;port, but being re&s;olved in the mid&s;t and $eat of the battle to live or die among&s;t you all; to lay down, for my God, and for my kingdom, and for my people, my honour and my blood, even in the du&s;t. I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble-woman, but I have the heart of a King, and of a King of England too; and think foul &s;corn, that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, &s;hould dare to invade the borders of my realms: To which, rather than any di&s;honour &s;hall grow by me, I my&s;elf will take up arms; I my&s;elf will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field.

tenderne&s;s and admiration of the &s;oldiery: An attach|ment
to her per&s;on became a &s;pecies of enthu&s;ia&s;m among
<PB N="350" REF="391">
them: And they a&s;ked one another, whether it were
po&s;&s;ible that Engli&s;hmen could abandon this glorious
cau&s;e, could di&s;play le&s;s courage than appeared in the
female &s;ex, or could ever, by any dangers, be induced
to relinqui&s;h the defence of their heroic prince&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Spani&s;h Armada was ready in the beginning of
May; but the moment it was preparing to &s;ail, the
marque&s;s of Santa Croce, the admiral, was &s;eized with
a violent fever, of which he &s;oon after died. The vice|admiral,
the duke of Paliano, by a &s;trange concurrence
of accident, at the very &s;ame time, &s;uffered the &s;ame
fate; and the King appointed for admiral the duke of
Medina Sidonia, a nobleman of the greate&s;t family
in Spain, but unexperienced in action, and utterly
unacquainted with &s;ea affairs. Alcarede was appoint|ed
vice-admiral. This misfortune, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of
&s;o great an officer as Santa Croce, retarded the &s;ailing
of the Armada, and gave the Engli&s;h more time for
their preparations to oppo&s;e them. At la&s;t, the fleet,
full of hopes and alacrity, &s;et &s;ail from Li&s;bon; but
next day met with a violent tempe&s;t, which &s;cattered the
&s;hips,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> &s;unk &s;ome of the &s;malle&s;t, and forced the re&s;t to
take &s;helter in the Groyne, where they waited till they
could be refitted. When news of this event was car|ried
to England, the Queen concluded, that the de&s;ign
of an inva&s;ion was di&s;appointed for this &s;ummer; and
being always ready to lay hold of every pretence for
&s;aving money, &s;he made Wal&s;ingham write to the
admiral directing him to lay up &s;ome of the larger
&s;hips, and to di&s;charge the &s;eamen: But lord Effing|ham,
who was not &s;o &s;anguine in his hopes, u&s;ed the
freedom to di&s;obey the&s;e orders; and he begged leave
to retain all the &s;hips in &s;ervice, tho' it &s;hould be at his
own expence<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 545.</NOTE>. He took advantage of a north wind,
and &s;ailed towards the coa&s;t of Spain, with an inten|tion
of attacking the enemy in their harbours; but the
<PB N="351" REF="392">
wind changing to the &s;outh, he became apprehen&s;ive,
le&s;t they might have &s;et &s;ail, and by pa&s;&s;ing him at &s;ea,
invade England, now expo&s;ed by the ab&s;ence of the
fleet. He returned, therefore, with the utmo&s;t ex|pedition
to Plymouth, and lay at anchor in that har|bour.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE,
the Armada had repaired all her dama|ges;
and with fre&s;h hopes &s;et out again to &s;ea, in pro|&s;ecution
of her enterprize. The fleet con&s;i&s;ted of
a hundred and thirty ve&s;&s;els, of which near a hundred
were galleons, and were of greater &s;ize than any
which had ever before been u&s;ed in Europe. It carried
on board nineteen thou&s;and two hundred and ninety|five
&s;oldiers, eight thou&s;and four hundred and fifty-&s;ix
mariners, two thou&s;and and eighty-eight gally &s;laves,
and two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty great pieces
of bra&s;s ordnance. It was victualled for &s;ix months;
and was attended with twenty le&s;&s;er &s;hips, called cara|vals,
and ten &s;alves with &s;ix oars apiece<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. Appen. p. 221.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE plan formed by the King of Spain, was, that
the Armada &s;hould &s;ail to the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to Dunkirk
and Newport; and having cha&s;ed away all Engli&s;h or
Flemi&s;h ve&s;&s;els which might ob&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age, (for
it was never &s;uppo&s;ed they could make oppo&s;ition)
&s;hould join them&s;elves with the duke of Parma, &s;hould
thence make &s;ail to the Thames, and having landed the
whole Spani&s;h army, thus compleat at one blow the
entire conque&s;t of England. In pro&s;ecution of this
plan, Philip gave orders to the duke of Medina, that,
in pa&s;&s;ing along the chanel, he &s;hould &s;ail as near the
coa&s;t of France as he could with &s;afety; that he &s;hould
by his policy avoid meeting with the Engli&s;h fleet;
and keeping in view the main enterprize, &s;hould neglect
all &s;maller &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which might prove an ob&s;tacle,
or even interpo&s;e a delay, to the acqui&s;ition of a king|dom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 1$57.</NOTE>. After the Armada was under &s;ail, they took
<PB N="352" REF="393">
a fi&s;herman, who informed them, that the Engli&s;h
admiral had been lately at &s;ea, had heard of the tem|pe&s;t
which &s;cattered the Armada, had retired back into
Plymouth, and no longer expecting an inva&s;ion this
&s;ea&s;on, had laid up his &s;hips, and di&s;charged mo&s;t of
the &s;eamen. From this fal&s;e intelligence the duke of
Medina conceived the great facility of attacking and
de&s;troying the Engli&s;h &s;hips in harbour; and he was
tempted, by the pro&s;pect of &s;o deci&s;ive an enterprize,
to break his orders, and make &s;ail directly for Ply|mouth:
A re&s;olution which proved the &s;afety of Eng|land.
The Lizard was the fir&s;t land made by the
Armada,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th July.</NOTE> about &s;un&s;et; and as the Spaniards took
it for the Ram-head near Plymouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arma|da arrives in the Channel.</NOTE> they bore out
to &s;ea, with an intention of returning nextday, and at|tacking
the Engli&s;h navy. They were de&s;cried by Flem|ing,
a Scoti&s;h pyrate, who was roving in the&s;e &s;eas, and
who immediately &s;et &s;ail, to inform the Engli&s;h admiral
of their approach<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on. p. 158.</NOTE>: Another fortunate event, which
contributed extremely to the &s;afety of the fleet. Effing|ham
had ju&s;t time to get out of port, when he &s;aw
the Spani&s;h Armada coming full &s;ail towards him,
di&s;po&s;ed in the form of a half-moon, and &s;tretching
the di&s;tance of &s;even miles from the extremity of one
divi&s;ion to that of the other.</P>
<P>THE writers of that age rai&s;e their &s;tile by a pom|pous
de&s;cription of this &s;pectacle; the mo&s;t magnifi|cent
which had ever appeared upon the ocean, infu&s;|ing
equal terror and admiration into the minds of all
beholders. The lofty ma&s;ts, the &s;welling &s;ails, and
the towering prows of the Spani&s;h galleons, &s;eem
impo&s;&s;ible to be ju&s;tly painted, otherwi&s;e than by a&s;&s;um|ing
the colours of poetry; and an eloquent hi&s;torian
of Italy, in imitation of Camden, has a&s;&s;erted, that
the Armada, tho' the &s;hips bore every &s;ail, yet ad|vanced
<PB N="353" REF="394">
with a &s;low motion; as if the ocean groaned
with &s;upporting, and the winds were tired with impel|ling,
&s;o enormous a weight<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bentivoglia, part ii. lib. 4.</NOTE>. The truth, however,
is, the large&s;t of the Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els would &s;carce pa&s;s
for third rates in the pre&s;ent navy of England; yet
were they &s;o$ ill framed, or &s;o ill governed, that they
were quite unwieldy, and could not &s;ail upon a wind,
nor tack on occa&s;ion, nor be managed in &s;tormy
weather by the &s;eamen. Neither the mechanics of
&s;hip-building, nor the experience of mariners, had at|tained
&s;o great perfection as could &s;erve fro the &s;ecurity
and government of &s;uch bulky ve&s;&s;els; and the Eng|li&s;h,
who had already had experience how un&s;erviceable
they commonly were, were not di&s;mayed with their
tremendous appearance.</P>
<P>EFFINGHAM gave orders, not to come to a clo&s;e
fight with the Spaniards, where the &s;ize of the &s;hips,
he &s;u&s;pected, and the numbers of the &s;oldiers, would
be a di&s;advantage to the Engli&s;h; but to cannonade
them at a di&s;tance, and to wait the opportunity which
winds, currents, or various chances mu&s;t afford them,
of intercepting &s;ome &s;cattered ve&s;&s;els of the enemy.
Nor was it long before the event an&s;wered expectation.
A great &s;hip of Bi&s;cay, on board of which was a con&s;i|derable
part of the Spani&s;h money, was &s;et on fire by
accident; and while all hands were employed in ex|tingui&s;hing
it, &s;he fell behind the re&s;t of the Armada:
The great galleon of Andaluzia was detained by the
&s;pringing of her ma&s;t: and both the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were
taken, after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, by Sir Francis Drake.
As the Armada advanced up the channel, the Engli&s;h
hung upon the rear, and &s;till infe&s;ted them with &s;kir|mi&s;hes.
Each trial abated the confidence of the Spa|niards,
and added courage to the Engli&s;h; and the
latter &s;oon found, that even in clo&s;e fight the &s;ize of
the Spani&s;h &s;hips was no advantage to them. Their
<PB N="354" REF="395">
bulk expo&s;ed them the more to the fire of the enemy;
while their cannon, placed too high, &s;hot over the
heads of the Engli&s;h. The alarm having now reached
the coa&s;t of England, the nobility and gentry ha&s;tened
out with their ve&s;&s;els from every harbour, and rein|forced
the admiral. The earls of Oxford, Northum|berland,
and Cumberland, Sir Thomas Cecil, Sir
Robert Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Thomas Vava&s;or,
Sir Thomas Gerrard, Sir Charles Blount; with many
others, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by this generous and
di&s;intere&s;ted &s;ervice of their country. The Engli&s;h
fleet, after the conjunction of the&s;e &s;hips, amounted to
an hundred and forty &s;ail.</P>
<P>THE Armada had now reached Calais, and ca&s;t
anchor before that place, in expectation, that the
duke of Parma, who had got intelligence of their ap|proach,
would put to &s;ea, and join his forces to them.
The Engli&s;h admiral practi&s;ed here a very &s;ucce&s;sful
&s;tratagem upon the Spaniards. He took eight of his
&s;maller &s;hips, and filling them with all combu&s;tible
materials, &s;ent them, one after another, into the mid&s;t
of the enemy. The Spaniards fancied, that they were
fire&s;hips of the &s;ame contrivance with a famous ve&s;&s;el
which had lately done &s;o much execution in the
Schelde near Antwerp; and they immediately cut their
cables, and took to flight with the greate&s;t di&s;order
and precipitation. The Engli&s;h fell upon them next
morning, while in confu&s;ion; and be&s;ides doing great
damage to other &s;hips, they took or de&s;troyed about
twelve of the enemy.</P>
<P>BY this time, it was become apparent, that the inten|tion,
for which the&s;e great preparations were made by
the Spaniards, was entirely fru&s;trated. The ve&s;&s;els,
provided by the duke of Parma, were made for tran&s;|porting
&s;oldiers not for fighting; and that general,
when urged to leave the harbour, utterly refu&s;ed to ex|po&s;e
his flouri&s;hing army to &s;uch apparent hazard, as
<PB N="355" REF="396">
it mu&s;t incur; while the Engli&s;h, not only were able
to keep the &s;ea, but &s;eemed even to triumph over
their enemy. The Spani&s;h admiral found, in many
rencounters, that while he lo&s;t &s;o con&s;iderable a part
of his own navy, he had de&s;troyed only one &s;mall ve&s;&s;el
of the Engli&s;h; and he fore&s;aw, that, by continuing
&s;o unequal a combat, he mu&s;t draw inevitable de&s;truc|tion
on all the remainder. He prepared therefore to
return homewards; but as the winds were contrary
to his pa&s;&s;age thro' the channel, he re&s;olved to &s;ail
northwards, and making the tour of the whole i&s;land,
reach the Spani&s;h harbours by the ocean. The Engli&s;h
fleet followed him during &s;ome time; and had not
their ammunition fallen &s;hort, by the negligence of the
offices in &s;upplying them, they had obliged the whole
Armada to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. The duke of
Medina had once taken that re&s;olution; but was di|verted
from it by the advice of his confe&s;&s;or. This
conclu&s;ion of the enterprize would have been more
glorious to the Engli&s;h; but the event proved equally
fatal to the Spaniards. A violent tempe&s;t overtook
the Armada after it pa&s;&s;ed the Orkneys: The &s;hips had
already lo&s;t their anchors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeated.</NOTE> and were obliged to keep
to &s;ea: The mariners, unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch hard|&s;hips,
and not able to govern &s;uch unwieldy ve&s;&s;els,
yielded to the fury of the &s;torm, and allowed their
&s;hipe to drive either on the we&s;tern i&s;les of Scot|land,
or on the coa&s;t of Ireland, where they were mi&s;e|rably
wrecked. Not a half of the navy returned to
Spain; and the &s;eamen, as well as &s;oldiers, who re|mained,
were &s;o overcome with hard&s;hip and fatigue,
&s;o di&s;pirited by their di&s;comfiture, that they filled all
Spain with accounts of the valour of the Engli&s;h, and
of the tempe&s;tuous violence of that ocean which &s;ur|rounds
them.</P>
<P>SUCH was the mi&s;erable and di&s;honourable con|clu&s;ion
of an enterprize, which had been preparing
<PB N="356" REF="397">
for three years, which had exhau&s;ted the revenue and
force of Spain, and which had long filled all Europe
with anxiety or expectation. Philip, who was a &s;lave
to his ambition, but had an entire command over his
countenance, no &s;ooner heard of the mortifying event,
which bla&s;ted all his &s;chemes, than he fell on his knees,
and rendering thanks for that gracious di&s;pen&s;ation of
providence, expre&s;&s;ed his joy that the calamity was not
greater. The Spani&s;h prie&s;ts, who had &s;o often ble&s;t
this holy cru&s;ade, and foretold its infallible &s;ucce&s;s,
were &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s to account for the victory
gained over the catholic monarch by excommunicated
heretics and an execrable u&s;urper: But they at la&s;t di&s;|covered,
that all the calamities of the Spaniards had
proceeded from their allowing the infidel Moors to live
among them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 525. On the fourth of September, &s;oon after the di&s;per&s;ion of the Spani&s;h Armada, died the earl of Leice&s;ter, the Queen's great, but unworthy, favourite. Her affection to him continued to the la&s;t. He had di&s;covered no conduct in any of his military enter|prizes; and was &s;u&s;pected of cowardice: Yet &s;he entru&s;ted him with the command of her armies during the danger of the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion; a par|tiality, which might have proved fatal to her, had the duke of Parma been able to land his troops in England. She had even ordered a commi&s;&s;ion to be drawn for him, con&s;tituting him her lieutenant in the kingdoms of England and Ireland; but Burleigh and Hatton repre&s;ented to her the danger of entru&s;ting &s;uch unlimited authority in the hands of any &s;ubject, and prevented the execution of that de&s;ign. No wonder, that a conduct, &s;o unlike the u&s;ual jealou&s;y of Elizabeth, gave rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that her partiality was founded on &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ion than friend&s;hip. But Elizabeth &s;eemed to carry her affection to Leice&s;ter no farther than the grave: She ordered his goods to be di&s;po&s;ed of at a public &s;ale, to reimbur&s;e her&s;elf of &s;ome money which he owed her; and her u&s;ual attention to money was ob&s;erved to prevail over her regard to the memory of the decea&s;ed. This earl was a great hypocrite, a pretender to the &s;tricte&s;t religion, an encoura|ger of the puritans, and a founder of ho&s;pitals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOON after the defeat and di&s;per&s;ion of the Spani&s;h Ar|mada,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.
D. 1589. 4th Februa|$y.</NOTE> the Queen &s;ummoned a new Parliament; and
received from them a &s;upply of two &s;ub&s;idies and four
fifteenths payable in four years. This is the fir&s;t in|&s;tance
that &s;ub&s;idies were doubled in one &s;upply; and
<PB N="357" REF="398">
&s;o unu&s;ual a conce&s;&s;ion was probably obtained form the
joy of the pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s, and from the general &s;en&s;e

to this heavy charge, on account of the great bur|then
of loans, which had lately been impo&s;ed upon
them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 542. Id. $ppen. p. 239. There are &s;ome &s;ingular pa&s;&s;ages in this la&s;t &s;peech, which may be worth taking notice of; e&s;pecial|ly as they came from a member who was no courtier: For he argues again&s;t the &s;ub&s;idy. &startq;And fir&s;t,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;for the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> thereof, I cannot deny, but if it were a charge impo&s;ed upon us by her maje&s;ty's com|mandment, or a demand proceeding from her maje&s;ty by way of reque&s;t, that I think there is not one among us all, either &s;o di&s;obedient a &s;ub|ject in regard of our duty, or &s;o unthankful a man in re&s;pect of the ine&s;ti|mable benefits which, by her or from her, we have received, which would not with frank con&s;ent, both of voice and heart, mo&s;t willingly &s;ubmit him&s;elf thereunto, without any unreverend enquiry into the cau&s;es thereof.

<P>ELIZABETH fore&s;aw, that this hou&s;e of commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE>
like all the foregoing, would be governed by the puri|tans;
and therefore, to obviate their enterprizes, &s;he
renewed, at the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, her u&s;ual in|junction,
that the parliament &s;hould not, on any ac|count,
pre&s;ume to treat of matters eccle&s;ia&s;tical. Not|with&s;tanding
this &s;trict inhibition, the zeal of one
Damport moved him to pre&s;ent a bill to the commons
<PB N="358" REF="399">
for remedying the grievances, and re&s;training the ty|ranny,
of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion, which were cer|tainly
enormous: But when Mr. &s;ecretary Woley re|minded
the hou&s;e of her maje&s;ty's commands, no one
dur&s;t &s;econd the motion; the bill was not &s;o much as
read; and the &s;peaker returned it back to Damport,
without taking the lea&s;t notice of it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 438.</NOTE>. Some mem|bers
of the hou&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the general &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion,
were even committed to cu&s;tody on account of
this attempt<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgift, p. 280. Neal, vol. I. p. 500.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE imperious conduct of Elizabeth appeared &s;till
more clearly in another parliamentary tran&s;action.
The right of purveyance was an antient prerogative,
by which the officers of the crown could at plea&s;ure take
provi&s;ions for the hou&s;hold from all the neighbouring
counties, and could make u&s;e of carts and carriages;
and the price of the&s;e &s;ervices was fixed and &s;tated.
The payment of the money was often di&s;tant and un|certain;
and the rates were always much inferior to
the market price; &s;o that purveyance, be&s;ides the &s;la|very
of it, was always regarded as a great burthen, and
being arbitrary and ca&s;ual, was liable to great abu&s;es.
We may fairly pre&s;ume, that the hungry courtiers of
Elizabeth, &s;upported by her unlimited power, would
be &s;ure to render this prerogative very oppre&s;&s;ive to the
people; and the commons had, la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, found it
nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s a bill for regulating the&s;e exac|tions:
But the bill was lo&s;t in the hou&s;e of peers<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 434.</NOTE>.
The continuance of the abu&s;es begot a new attempt
for redre&s;s; and the &s;ame bill was now revived, and
&s;ent up again to the hou&s;e of peers, together with a
bill for &s;ome new regulations in the court of Exche|quer.
Soon after, the commons received a me&s;&s;age
from the upper hou&s;e, de&s;iring them to appoint a com|mittee
for a conference. At this conference, the peers
<PB N="359" REF="400">
informed them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1589.</NOTE> that the Queen, by a me&s;&s;age, deliver|ed
by lord Burleigh, had expre&s;&s;ed her di&s;plea&s;ure,
that the commons &s;hould pre&s;ume to touch on her pre|rogative.
If their were any abu&s;es, &s;he &s;aid, either in
impo&s;ing purveyance, or in the practice of the court of
Exchequer, her maje&s;ty was both able and willing to
provide due reformation; but would not permit the
Parliament to intermeddle in the&s;e matters<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes. p. 440.</NOTE>. The
commons, alarmed at this intelligence, appointed a
new committee to attend the Queen, and endeavour
to &s;atisfy her of their humble and dutiful intentions.
Elizabeth gave a gracious reception to the committee:
She expre&s;&s;ed her great <HI>ine&s;timable loving care</HI> towards
her loving &s;ubjects; which, &s;he &s;aid, was greater than of
her own &s;elf, or even than any of them could have of
them&s;elves. She told them, that &s;he had already given
orders for an enquiry into the abu&s;es attending pur|veyance,
but the dangers of the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion had
retarded the progre&s;s of that de&s;ign; that &s;he had as
much &s;kill, will, and power to rule her own hou&s;ehold
as any &s;ubjects what&s;oever to govern theirs, and needed
as little the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her neighbours; that the Ex|chequer
was her chamber, con&s;equently more near to

purveyance<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><P>We may judge of the extent and importance of the&s;e abu&s;es by a &s;peech of Bacon's again&s;t purveyors, delivered in the fir&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t Par|liament of the &s;ub&s;equent reign. &startq;Fir&s;t,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;they take in hand what they ought not to take; &s;econdly, they take in quantity a far greater proportion than cometh &s;o your maje&s;ty's u&s;e; thirdly, they take in an unlawful manner, in a manner, I &s;ay, directly and expre&s;sly pro|hibited by &s;everal laws. For the fir&s;t, I am a little to alter their name: For in&s;tead of takers, they become taxers: In&s;tead of taking provi&s;ions for your maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, they tax your people <HI>ad redimendam vexatio|nem;</HI> impo&s;ing upon them and extorting from them divers &s;ums of mo|ney, &s;ometimes in gro&s;s, &s;ometimes in the nature of &s;tipends annually paid, <HI>ne noceant,</HI> to be freed and ea&s;ed of their oppre&s;&s;ion. Again, they take trees, which by law they cannot do; timber trees, which are the beauty, countenance and &s;helter of men's hou&s;es; that men have long &s;pared from their own pur&s;e and profit; that men e&s;teem, for their u&s;e and delight, above ten times the value; that are a lo&s;s which men can|not repair or recover. The&s;e do they take, to the defacing and &s;poiling of your &s;ubjects man&s;ions and dwellings, except they may be com|pounded with to their own appetites. And if a gentleman be too hard for them while he is at home, they will watch their time when there is but a bailiff or a &s;ervant remaining, and put the ax to the root of the tree, ere ever the ma&s;ter can &s;top it. Again, they u&s;e a &s;trange and mo&s;t unju&s;t exaction in cau&s;ing the &s;ubjects to pay poundage of their own debts, due from your maje&s;ty unto them: So as a poor man, when he has had his hay or his wood, or his poultry (which perchance he was full loath to part with, and had for the provi&s;ion of his own family and not to put to &s;ale) taken from him, and that not at a ju&s;t price, but under the value, and cometh to receive his money, he &s;hall have after the rate of twelve pence in the pound abated for poundage of his due pay|ment upon &s;o hard conditions. Nay farther they are grown to that extremity (as is affirmed, tho' it be &s;carce credible, &s;ave that in &s;uch per&s;ons all things are credible) that they will take double poundage, once when the debenture is made, and again the &s;econd time, when the money is paid. For the &s;econd point, mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign, touching the quantity which they take far above that which is an&s;wered to your maje&s;ty's u&s;e; it is affirmed unto me by divers gentlemen of good report, as a matter which I may &s;afely avouch unto your maje&s;ty, that there is no pound profit, which redoundeth unto your maje&s;ty in this cour&s;e but induceth and begetteth three pound damage upon your &s;ubjects, be&s;ide the di&s;contentment. And to the end they may make their &s;poi$ more &s;ecurely, what do they? Whereas divers &s;tatutes do &s;trictly provide, that what&s;oever they take &s;hall be regi&s;tered and atte&s;ted, to the the end that by making a collation of that which is taken from the country and that which is an&s;wered above, their deceits might appear, they, to the end to ob&s;cure their deceits, utterly omit the ob&s;ervation of this, which the law pre&s;cribeth. And therefore to de&s;cend, if it may plea&s;e your maje&s;ty, to the third &s;ort of abu&s;e, which is of the unlaw|ful manner of their taking, whereof this que&s;tion is a branch; it is &s;o manifold, as it rather a&s;keth an enumeration of &s;ome of the particulars than a pro&s;ecution of all. For their price, by law they ought to take as they can agree with the &s;ubject; by abu&s;e they take at an impo&s;ed and enforced price: By law they ought to make but one apprizement by neighbours in the country; by abu&s;e, they make a &s;econd apprizement at the court gate, and when the &s;ubjects cattle come up many miles lean and out of plight by rea&s;on of their travel, then they prize them anew at an abated price: By law, they ought to take between &s;un and &s;un; by abu&s;e, they take by twilight and in the night-time, a time well cho&s;en for malefactors: By law, they ought not to take in the high-ways (a place by her maje&s;ty's high prerogative protected, and by &s;tatute by &s;pecial words excepted) by abu&s;e, they take in the high-ways: By law, they ought to &s;hew their commi&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. A number of other particulars there are, &amp;c.&endq; Bacon's works, vol. IV. p. 305, 306.</P>
<P>Such were the abu&s;es, which Elizabeth would neither permit her Parlia|ments to meddle with, nor redre&s;s her&s;elf. I believe it will readily be allowed, that this &s;light prerogative alone, which has pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t unob|&s;erved amid&s;t other branches of &s;o much greater importance, was &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h all regular liberty.

Portugal, it is believed, that the good will of the peo|ple,

might have en&s;ured them of &s;ucce&s;s: But hearing, that
great preparations were making at the Groine, for the
inva&s;ion of England, they were induced to go thither,
and de&s;troy this new armament of Spain. They broke
into the harbour; burned &s;ome &s;hips of war, particu|larly
one commanded by Recalde, vice admiral of Spain;
they defeated an army of four or five thou&s;and men,
which was a&s;&s;embled to oppo&s;e them; they a&s;&s;aulted
the Groine, and took the lower town, which they pil|laged;
and they would have taken the higher, tho' well
fortified, had they not found their ammunition and pro|vi&s;ions
beginning to fall &s;hort. The young earl of
E&s;&s;ex, a nobleman of very promi&s;ing hopes, who, fired
with the thir&s;t of military honour, had &s;ecretly, un|known
to the Queen, &s;tole from England, here join|ed
the adventurers; and it was then agreed by com|mon
con&s;ent to make &s;ail for Portugal, the main object
of their enterprize.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h landed at Paniche, a &s;ea-port town,
twelve leagues from Li&s;bon; and Norris led the army
to that capital, while Drake undertook to &s;ail up the
river, and attack the city with united forces. By this
time, the court of Spain had got leizure to prepare
again&s;t the inva&s;ion of the Engli&s;h. Forces were
thrown into Li&s;bon: The Portugue&s;e were di&s;armed:
All &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons were taken into cu&s;tody: And thus,
tho' the inhabitants bore great affection to Don An|tonio,
<PB N="364" REF="407">
none of them dared to declare in favour of the
invaders. The Engli&s;h army, however, made them|&s;elves
ma&s;ters of the &s;uburbs, which abounded with
riches of all kinds; but as they de&s;ired to conciliate the
affections of the Portugueze, and were more intent on
honour than profit, they ob&s;erved a &s;trict di&s;cipline,
and ab&s;tained from all plunder. Meanwhile they found
their ammunition and provi&s;ions totally exhau&s;ted;
they had not a &s;ingle cannon to make a breach in the
walls; the admiral had not been able to pa&s;s &s;ome for|tre&s;&s;es,
which guarded the river; there was no appear|ance
of any in&s;urrection in their favour; &s;ickne&s;s from
fatigue, hunger, and intemperance in wine and fruits
had &s;eized the army: So that it was found requi&s;ite to
make all ha&s;te po&s;&s;ible to reimbark. They were not
pur&s;ued by the enemy; and finding, at the mouth of
the river, &s;ixty &s;hips laden with naval &s;tores, they &s;ei|zed
them as lawful prize; tho' they belonged to the
Han&s;e Towns, a neutral power. They &s;ailed thence
to Vigo, which they took and burned; and having
ravaged the country round, they &s;et &s;ail and arrived
&s;afely in England. Above the half of the&s;e gallant ad|venturers
peri&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s, famine, fatigue, and
the &s;word<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. I. p. 6$.</NOTE>; and England reaped much more honour
than profit from this extraordinary expedition. It is

on board this fleet, and that only three hundred and
fifty &s;urvived the&s;e multiplied di&s;a&s;ters<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Birch, Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the&s;e &s;hips were on their voyage homewards,
they met with the earl of Cumberland, who was out|ward
bound, with a fleet of &s;even &s;ail, all equipped at
his own charge, except one &s;hip of war, which the
Queen had lent him. That nobleman &s;upplied Sir

which &s;aved the lives of many of Drake's men, but
which the others &s;uffered &s;everely for afterwards.

on Scotland, who&s;e &s;ituation rendered the revolutions

have been expected, that this high-&s;pirited prince&s;s,
who knew &s;o well how to brave danger, would not
have retained that &s;u&s;picious jealou&s;y towards Scotland,
with which, during the life-time of Mary, &s;he had been
&s;o much agitated. James had indeed &s;ucceeded to all
his mother's claims; but he had not &s;ucceeded to the
favour of the catholics, which could alone render the&s;e
claims dangerous<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 51.</NOTE>: And as the Queen was now well
advanced in years, and enjoyed the mo&s;t uncontrouled
authority over her &s;ubjects, it was not likely, that the
King of Scots, who was of an indolent unambitious
temper, would ever give her any di&s;turbance in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her throne. Yet all the&s;e circum&s;tances
could not remove her timorous &s;u&s;picions: And &s;o far
from &s;atisfying the nation by a &s;ettlement of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
or a declaration of James's title, &s;he was as
anxious to prevent every incident, which might rai&s;e
his credit or procure him the regard of the Engli&s;h, as
if he had been her immediate rival and competitor.
Mo&s;t of his mini&s;ters and favourites were her pen&s;ion|ers;
and as &s;he was de&s;irous to h$$der him from marry|ing
<PB N="366" REF="409">
and having children, &s;he obliged them to throw
ob&s;tacles in the way of their alliance, even the mo&s;t
rea&s;onable, which could be offered him; and during
&s;ome years, &s;he &s;ucceeded in this malignant policy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Melvil, p. 166, 177.</NOTE>.
He had fixed on the elde&s;t daughter of the King of
Denmark, who being a remote prince and not very
powerful, could give her no umbrage; yet did &s;he &s;o
artfully cro&s;s this negotiation, that the Dani&s;h monarch,
impatient of delay, married his daughter to the Duke
of Brun&s;wic. James then renewed his &s;uit to the
younger prince&s;s; and &s;till found ob&s;tacles from the in|trigues
of Elizabeth, who, merely with a view of in|terpo&s;ing
delay, propo&s;ed to him the &s;i&s;ter of the King
of Navarre, a prince&s;s much older than him&s;elf, and en|tirely
de&s;titute of fortune. The young King, be&s;ides
the de&s;ire of &s;ecuring him&s;elf by the pro&s;pect of i&s;&s;ue,
from tho&s;e traiterous attempts, too frequent among his
&s;ubjects, had been &s;o watched by the rigid au&s;terity of
the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, that he had another inducement to
marriage, which is not &s;o u&s;ual with monarchs. His
impatience therefore broke thro' all the politics of
Elizabeth: The articles of marriage were &s;ettled: The
ceremony was performed by proxy: And the prince&s;s
embarked for Scotland; but was drove by a &s;torm into
a port of Norway. This tempe&s;t, and &s;ome others,
which happened near the &s;ame time, were univer&s;ally
believed in Scotland and Denmark to have proceeded
from a combination of the Scotti&s;h and Dani&s;h witch|es;
and the dying confe&s;&s;ion of the criminals was &s;up|po&s;ed
to place the accu&s;ation beyond all controver&s;y<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 180.</NOTE>.
James, however, tho' a great believer in &s;orcery, was
not deterred by this incident from taking a voyage, in
order to conduct his bride home: He arrived in Nor|way;
carried the Queen thence to Copenhagen; and
having pa&s;&s;ed the winter in that city, he brought her
next &s;pring to Scotland, where they were joyfully re|ceived
<PB N="367" REF="410">
by the people. The clergy alone, who never
neglected an opportunity of vexing him, made oppo&s;i|tion
to the Queen's coronation, on account of the
ceremony of anointing her, which, they alledged, was
either a Jewi&s;h or a popi&s;h rite; and therefore utterly
antichri&s;tian and unlawful. But James was as much
bent on the ceremony, as they were aver&s;e to it; and
after much controver&s;y and many intrigues, his autho|rity,
which had not often happened, at la&s;t prevailed
over their oppo&s;ition<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 381.</NOTE>.

<P>AFTER a &s;tate of great anxiety and many difficul|ties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLIII.</NOTE> Elizabeth had at length reached a &s;ituation,
where, tho' her affairs &s;till required attention, and
found employment for her active temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1590.</NOTE> &s;he was re|moved
from all danger of any immediate revolution,
and might regard the efforts of her enemies with &s;ome
degree of confidence and &s;ecurity. Her &s;ucce&s;sful and
prudent admini&s;tration had gained her, together with
the admiration of foreigners, the affections of her
own &s;ubjects; and after the death of the Queen of Scots,
even the catholics, however di&s;contented, pretended
not to di&s;pute her title, or adhere to any other per&s;on
as her rival and competitor. James, curbed by his fac|tious
nobility and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at home very
little authority; and was &s;ollicitous to remain on good
terms with Elizabeth and the Engli&s;h nation, in hopes
that time, aided by his patient tranquillity, would
&s;ecure him that rich &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to which his birth en|titled
him. The Hollanders, tho' overmatched in their
conte&s;t with Spain, &s;till made an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance;
and &s;uch was their unconquerable antipathy to their
old ma&s;ters, and &s;uch the prudent conduct of young
Maurice, their governor, that the &s;ubduing that &s;mall
territory, if at all po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t be the work of years,
and the re&s;ult of many and great &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Philip,
who, in his powerful effort again&s;t England, had been
<PB N="369" REF="414">
tran&s;ported by re&s;entment and ambition beyond his
u&s;ual cautious maxims, was now di&s;abled, and &s;till
more di&s;couraged, from adventuring again on &s;uch ha|zardous
enterprizes. The &s;ituation al&s;o of affairs in
France, began chiefly to employ his attention; but
notwith&s;tanding all his artifice, and force, and expence,
the events in that kingdom proved every day more con|trary
to his preten&s;ions, and more favourable to the
friends and confederates of England.</P>
<P>THE violence of the League having con&s;trained
Henry to declare war again&s;t the Hugonots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">French af|fairs.</NOTE> the&s;e re|ligioni&s;ts
&s;eemed expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t danger; and
Elizabeth, &s;en&s;ible of the intimate connexion between
her own intere&s;ts and tho&s;e of that party, had &s;upported
the King of Navarre by her negociations in Germany,
and &s;till more by large &s;ums of money, which &s;he re|mitted
for levying forces in that country. That heroic
prince, not di&s;couraged by the great &s;uperiority of his
enemies, took the field; and in the year 1587 gained,
at Coutras, a compleat victory over the army of the
French King; but as his allies, the Germans, were
at the &s;ame time di&s;comfited by the army of the League,
under the duke of Gui&s;e, his &s;ituation, notwith&s;tand|ing
his victory, &s;eemed &s;till as de&s;perate as ever. The
chief advantage which he reaped from this diver&s;ity of
&s;ucce&s;s, was the divi&s;ions which, by that means, took
place among his enemies. The inhabitants of Paris,
intoxicated with admiration of Gui&s;e, and &s;trongly
prejudiced again&s;t their King, who&s;e intentions had
become &s;u&s;picious to them, took to arms, and obliged
Henry to fly for his &s;afety. That prince, di&s;&s;embling
his re&s;entment, entered into a negociation with the
League; and having conferred many high offices on
Gui&s;e and his partizans, &s;ummoned an a&s;&s;embly of the
&s;tates at Blois, on pretence of finding means and ex|pedients
to &s;upport the intended war agai$&s;t the Hu|gonots.
The various &s;cenes of perfidy and cruelty
<PB N="370" REF="415">
which had been exhibited in France, had ju&s;tly begot a
mutual diffidence among all parties; yet Gui&s;e, tru&s;t|ing
more to the timidity than honour of the King,
ra&s;hly put him&s;elf into the hands of that monarch,
and expected, by the a&s;cendant of his own genius, to
make him &s;ubmit to all his exorbitant preten&s;ions.
Henry, tho' of an ea&s;y di&s;po&s;ition, not &s;teddy to his
re&s;olutions, nor even to his promi&s;es, wanted neither
courage nor capacity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of the duke of Gui&s;e.</NOTE> and finding all his &s;ubtilties
eluded by the vigour of Gui&s;e, and even his throne
expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger, he embraced
more violent coun&s;els than were natural to him, and
ordered that duke and his brother, the cardinal of Gui&s;e,
to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in his palace.</P>
<P>THIS cruel execution, which the nece&s;&s;ity of it could
alone excu&s;e, had nearly proved fatal to the author,
and &s;eemed at fir&s;t to plunge him into greater dangers
than tho&s;e&punc; which he &s;ought to avoid, by taking ven|geance
on his enemy. The partizans of the League
were enflamed with the utmo&s;t rage again&s;t him: The
populace every where, particularly at Paris, renounced
all allegiance to him: The eccle&s;ia&s;tics and the preach|ers
filled all places with execrations again&s;t his name:
And the mo&s;t powerful cities, and mo&s;t opulent pro|vinces,
appeared to combine in a re&s;olution of renounc|ing
monarchy, or of changing their monarch. Henry,
finding &s;lender re&s;ources among his catholic &s;ubjects,
was con&s;trained to enter into a confederacy with the
Hugonots and the King of Navarre: He enli&s;ted large
bodies of Swi&s;s infantry and German cavalry: And
being &s;till &s;upported by his chief nobility, he a&s;&s;embled,
by all the&s;e means, an army of near forty thou&s;and
men, and advanced to the gates of Paris, ready to cru&s;h
the League, and &s;ubdue all his enemies. The de&s;|perate
re&s;olution of one man diverted the cour&s;e of the&s;e
great events. Jaques Clement, a Dominican monk,
inflamed by that bloody &s;pirit of bigotry which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
<PB N="371" REF="416">
this century and a great part of the following
beyond all other ages of the world, embraced the re|&s;olution
of &s;acrificing his own life, in order to &s;ave the
church from the per&s;ecutions of an heretical tyrant;
and being admitted, under &s;ome pretext, to the King's
pre&s;ence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Henry the third.</NOTE> he gave that prince a mortal wound with
a knife, and was immediately put to death, by the
courtiers, who ha&s;tily revenged the murder of their
&s;overeign. This remarkable incident happened on the
fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1589.</P>
<P>THE King of Navarre, next heir to the crown, a&s;|&s;umed
the government, under the title of Henry the
fourth; but &s;ucceeded to much greater difficulties than
tho&s;e which &s;urrounded his predece&s;&s;or. The preju|dices
entertained again&s;t his religion, made a great part
of the nobility de&s;ert him; and it was only by his pro|mi&s;e
of hearkening to conferences and in&s;truction, that
he could engage any of the catholics to adhere to his
undoubted title. The League, governed by duke of
Mayenne, brother to Gui&s;e, gathered new force; and
the King of Spain entertained views, either of di&s;mem|bering
the monarchy, or of annexing the whole to his
own dominions. In the&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances,
Henry addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Elizabeth, and found her
well di&s;po&s;ed to contribute to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to op|po&s;e
the progre&s;s of the catholic League, and of the
King of Spain, her inveterate and dangerous enemies.
To prevent the de&s;ertion of his Swi&s;s and German
troops, &s;he made him a pre&s;ent of twenty-two thou&s;and
pounds; a larger &s;um than, as he declared, he had ever
&s;een before: And &s;he &s;ent him a reinforcement of four
thou&s;and men, under lord Willoughby, an officer of
reputation, who joined the French at Dieppe. Strength|ened
by the&s;e &s;upplies, Henry marched directly to
Paris; and having taken the &s;uburbs, &s;word in hand,
he abandoned them to be pill$ged by his &s;oldiers. He
employed this body of Engli&s;h troops in many other

enterprizes; and found &s;till great rea&s;on to prai&s;e their
courage and fidelity. The time of their &s;ervice being
elap&s;ed, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with many high commen|dations.
Sir William Drury, Sir Thomas Ba&s;kerville,
and Sir John Boroughs, acquired reputation this cam|paign,
and revived in France the ancient fame of Eng|li&s;h
valour.</P>
<P>THE army which Henry next campaign led into
the field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of Henry the fourth.</NOTE> was much inferior to that of the League;
but as it was compo&s;ed of the chief nobility of France,
he feared not to encounter his enemies in a pitched
battle at Yvr&eacute;e, and he gained a compleat victory over
them. This &s;ucce&s;s enabled him to blockade Paris,
and he reduced that capital to the la&s;t extremity of
famine: When the duke of Parma, in con&s;equence
of orders from Philip, marched to the relief of the
League, and obliged Henry to rai&s;e the blockade.
Having performed this important &s;ervice, he retired
back to the Low Countries: and by his con&s;ummate
&s;kill in the art of war, performed the&s;e long marches
in the face of the enemy, without affording the French
monarch that opportunity which he &s;ought, of giving
him battle, or &s;o much as putting his army once in
di&s;order. The only lo&s;s which he &s;u&s;tained, was in
the Low Countries; where prince Maurice took ad|vantage
of his ab&s;ence, and recovered &s;ome towns
which Parma had formerly conquered from the States<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">This year the nation &s;u&s;fereda great lo&s;s, by the death of Sir Francis Wal|&s;ingham, &s;ecretary of &s;tate; a man equally celebrated for his ability and his integrity.

He left only one daughter, fir&s;t married to Sir Philip Sidney, then to the earl of E&s;&s;ex, favourite to Queen Elizabeth, and la&s;tly to the earl of Clan$icarde of Ireland. The &s;ame year died Thomas Randolph, who had been employed by the Queen in &s;everal emba&s;&s;ies to Scotland; as did al&s;o the earl of Warwic, elder brother to Leice&s;ter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of Henry's affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1591.</NOTE> tho' promi&s;ing,
was not &s;o well advanced or e&s;tabli&s;hed as to make
the Queen di&s;continue her &s;uccours; and &s;he was &s;till
<PB N="373" REF="420">
more confirmed in the re&s;olution of &s;upporting him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1591.</NOTE>
by &s;ome advantages gained by the King of Spain.
The duke of Mercoeur, governor of Britany, a prince
of the hou&s;e of Lorraine, had declared for the League;
and finding him&s;elf hard pre&s;&s;ed by Henry's forces, he
had been obliged, in order to his &s;ecurity, to introduce
&s;ome Spani&s;h troops into the &s;ea-port towns of that
province. Elizabeth was alarmed with the danger;
and fore&s;aw, that the Spaniards, be&s;ides infe&s;ting the
Engli&s;h commerce by privateers, might employ the&s;e
harbours as the &s;eat of their naval preparations, and
might more ea&s;ily, from that near neighbourhood, than
from Spain or Portugal, project an inva&s;ion of Eng|land.
She concluded, therefore, a new treaty with
Henry, in which &s;he engaged to &s;end over three thou|&s;and
men, to be employed in the reduction of Britanny,
and &s;tipulated, that her charges &s;hould, in a twelve
month, or &s;o &s;oon as the enemy was expelled, be re|funded
her<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 561.</NOTE>. The&s;e forces were commanded by Sir
John Norris; and under him by his brother Henry,
and by Anthony Shirley. Sir Roger Williams was at
the head of a &s;mall body which garri&s;oned Dieppe:
And a &s;quadron of &s;hips, under the command of Sir
Henry Palmer, lay upon the coa&s;t of France, and inter|cepted
all the ve&s;&s;els belonging to the Spaniards or the
Leaguers.</P>
<P>THE events of war can very little be regulated before|hand
by any treaty or agreement; and Henry, who
found it nece&s;&s;ary to lay a&s;ide the projected enterprize
again&s;t Britanny, per&s;uaded the Engli&s;h commanders
to join his army, and to take a &s;hare in the war which
he carried on in Picardy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 116.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;gu&s;t
which Elizabeth received from this di&s;appointment,
he laid before her a plan for expelling the Leaguers
from Normandy, and per&s;uaded her to &s;end over a
new body of four thou&s;and men, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in that
<PB N="374" REF="421">
enterprize. The earl of E&s;&s;ex was appointed general
of the&s;e forces; a young nobleman, who, by many
exterior accompli&s;hments, and &s;till more real merit,
was daily advancing in favour with Elizabeth, and
&s;eemed to occupy that place in her affections which
Leice&s;ter, who was now decea&s;ed, had &s;o long enjoyed.
E&s;&s;ex, impatient for military fame, was extremely
unea&s;y to lie &s;ome time at Dieppe unemployed; and
had not the orders which he received from his mi&s;tre&s;s
heen &s;o po&s;itive, he would gladly have accepted of
Henry's invitation, and have marched to join the
French army now in Champagne. This plan of ope|rations
was al&s;o propo&s;ed to Elizabeth by the French
amba&s;&s;ador; but &s;he rejected it with great di&s;plea&s;ure;
and &s;he threatned immediately to recall her troops, if
Henry &s;hould per&s;evere any longer in his pre&s;ent prac|tice,
of breaking all concert with her, and attending to
nothing but his own intere&s;ts<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Birch's Negociations. p. 5. Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 123, 140.</NOTE>. Urged by the&s;e mo|tives,
the French King, at la&s;t, led his army into Nor|mandy,
and laid &s;iege to Ro&uuml;en, which he reduced to
great difficulties. But the League, who were unable
of them&s;elves to take the field again&s;t him, had again
recour&s;e to the duke of Parma, who received orders to
march to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He executed this enter|prize
with his u&s;ual ability and &s;ucce&s;s; and, for the
pre&s;ent, fru&s;trated all the projects of Henry and Eliza|beth.
This prince&s;s, who kept &s;till in view the in|tere&s;ts
of her own kingdoms in all her foreign tran&s;ac|tions,
was impatient under the&s;e di&s;appointments, blam|ed
Henry for his negligence in the execution of treaties,
and complained, that the Engli&s;h forces were thru&s;t for|ward
in every hazardous enterprize<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 562.</NOTE>. It is probable,
however, that their own ardent courage, and their
de&s;ire of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves in &s;o celebrated a
<PB N="375" REF="422">
theatre for war, were the cau&s;e why they &s;o often en|joyed
this perilous honour.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the indifferent &s;ucce&s;s of for|mer
enterprizes, the Queen was &s;en&s;ible how nece&s;|&s;ary
it was to &s;upport Henry again&s;t the League and
the Spaniards; and &s;he formed a new treaty with him,
in which they agreed, never to make peace with Philip,
but by common con&s;ent; <HI>&s;he</HI> promi&s;ed to &s;end him
a new &s;upply of four thou&s;and men; and <HI>he</HI> &s;tipulated
to repay her charges in a twelvemonth, to employ
the&s;e forces, joined to a body of French troops, in an
expedition again&s;t Britanny, and to con&s;ign into her
hands a &s;ea-port town of that province, for a retreat
to the Engli&s;h<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. XVI. p. 151, 168, 171, 173.</NOTE>. Henry knew the impo&s;&s;ibility of exe|cuting
&s;ome of the&s;e articles, and the imprudence of
fulfilling others; but finding them rigidly in&s;i&s;ted on
by Elizabeth, he accepted of her &s;uccours, and tru&s;ted
that he might ea&s;ily, on &s;ome pretence, be able to ex|cu&s;e
his failure in the execution of his part of the treaty.
This campaign was the lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful to Henry of all
tho&s;e which he had yet carried on again&s;t the League.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e military operations in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval enter|prizes again&s;t Spain.</NOTE> Eli|zabeth
employed her naval power again&s;t Spain, and
endeavoured to intercept the We&s;t-Indian trea&s;ures,
the &s;ource of that greatne&s;s which rendered Philip &s;o
formidable to all his neighbours. She &s;ent a &s;quadron
of &s;even &s;hips, under the command of lord Thomas
Howard, for this &s;ervice; but the King of Spain,
informed of her purpo&s;e, fitted out a navy of fifty-five
&s;ail, and di&s;patched them to e&s;cort the Indian fleet.
They fell in with the Engli&s;h &s;quadron; and by the
courageous ob&s;tinacy of Sir Richard Greenville, the
vice-admiral, who refu&s;ed to make his e&s;cape by flight,
they took one &s;hip, the fir&s;t Engli&s;h man of war which
<PB N="376" REF="423">
had yet fallen into the hands of the Spaniards<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This action of Sir Richard Greenville is &s;o &s;ingular, as to merit a more particular relation. He was engaged alone with the whole Spani&s;h fleet of fifty-three &s;ail, which had ten thou&s;and men on board; and from the time the fight begun, which was about three in the afternoon, to the break of day next morning, he repul&s;ed the enemy fifteen times, tho' they continual|ly &s;hifted their ve&s;&s;els, and boarded with fre&s;h men. In the beginning of the action he him&s;elf received a wound; but he continued doing his duty above deck till eleven at night, when receiving a fre&s;h wound, he was car|ried down to be dre&s;&s;ed. During this operation he received a &s;hot in the head, and the &s;urgeon was killed by his &s;ide. The Engli&s;h began now to want powder; all their &s;mall arms were broke or become u&s;eless; of this number, which were but a hundred and three at fir&s;t, forty were killed, and almo&s;t all the re&s;t wounded; their ma&s;ts were beat overboard, their tackle cut in pieces, and nothing but a hulk left, unable to move one way or other. In this &s;ituation Sir Richard propo&s;ed to the &s;hip's company, to tru&s;t to the mercy of God, not to that of the Spaniards, and to de&s;troy the &s;hip with them&s;elves, rather than yield to the enemy. The ma&s;ter gunner, and many of the &s;eamen, agreed to this de&s;perate re&s;olution; but others oppo&s;ed it, and obliged Greenville to &s;urrender him&s;elf pri&s;oner. He died a few days after and his la&s;t words were: &startq;Here die I, Richard Green|ville, with a i$yful and quiet mind; for that I have ended my life as a true &s;oldier ought to do, fighting for his country, Queen, religion, and honour: My &s;oul willingly departing from this body, leaving behind the la&s;ting fame of having behaved as every valiant &s;oldier is in his duty bound to do.&endq; The Spaniards lo&s;t in this &s;harp tho' unequal action, four &s;hips, and about a thou&s;and men. And Greenville's ve&s;&s;el her&s;elf peri&s;hed &s;oon after, with two hundred Spaniards in her. Hackluyt's Voyages, vol. II. part 2. p. 169.

re&s;t of the &s;quadron returned &s;afely into England, fru&s;|trated
of their expectations, but plea&s;ing them&s;elves
with the idea that their attempt had not been altogether
fruitle&s;s in hurting the enemy. The Indian fleet
had been &s;o long detained in the Havanna, from the fear
of the Engli&s;h, that they were obliged at la&s;t to &s;et &s;ail
in an improper &s;ea&s;on, and mo&s;t of them peri&s;hed by
&s;hipwreck ere they reached the Spani&s;h harbours<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 163.</NOTE>.
The earl of Cumberland made a like un&s;ucce&s;sful enter|prize
again&s;t the Spani&s;h trade. He carried out one
&s;hip of the Queen's, and &s;even others, equipped at his
own expence; but the prizes which he made, did not
compen&s;ate him for the charges<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit of the&s;e expen&s;ive and hazardous adven|tures
was very prevalent in England. Sir Walter
<PB N="377" REF="424">
Raleigh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1593.</NOTE> who had enjoyed great favour with the Queen,
finding his intere&s;t to decline, re&s;olved to recover her
good graces by &s;ome important undertaking; and as his
reputation was high in England, he per&s;uaded great
numbers to engage with him as volunteers, in an at|tempt
on the We&s;t-Indies. The fleet was detained,
&s;o long in the Channel, by contrary winds, that the
&s;ea&s;on was lo&s;t; Raleigh was recalled by the Queen:
Sir Martin Forbi&s;her &s;ucceeded to the command, and
made a privateering voyage again&s;t the Spaniards. He
took a rich Carrack near the i&s;land of Flores, and de&s;|troyed

<P>THIS war did great damage to Spain; but it was
attended with con&s;iderable expence to England, and
Elizabeth's mini&s;ters computed, that, &s;ince the com|mencement
of it, &s;he had expended in Flanders and
France, and on her naval expeditions, above one mil|lion
two hundred thou&s;and pounds<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III.</NOTE>; a charge which,

money: For there was never any Parliament whom
&s;he treated in &s;o haughty a manner, whom &s;he made
more &s;en&s;ible of their own weakne&s;s, or who&s;e privile|ges
&s;he more undervalued. When the &s;peaker, Sir

<PB N="378" REF="425">
from arre&s;ts, of acce&s;s to her per&s;on, and of liber|ty
of &s;peech; &s;he replied to him, by the mouth of
Puckering, lord-keeper, that liberty of &s;peech was
granted the commons, but they mu&s;t know what liber|ty
they were entitled to; not a liberty for every one
to &s;peak what he li&s;teth, or what cometh in his brain
to utter; their privilege extended no farther than a
liberty of Aye or No: That &s;he enjoined the &s;peaker,
if he perceived any idle heads &s;o negligent of their own
&s;afety, as to attempt reforming the church, or inno|vating
in the commonwealth, that he &s;hould refu&s;e the
bills exhibited to that purpo&s;e, till they were examined
by &s;uch as were fitter to con&s;ider of the&s;e things, and
could better judge of them: That &s;he would not
impeach the freedom of their per&s;ons; but they mu&s;t
beware, left, under colour of this privilege, they imagi|ned,
that any neglect of their duty could be covered or
protected: And that &s;he would not refu&s;e them acce&s;s
to her per&s;on; provided it was upon urgent and weigh|ty
cau&s;es, and at times convenient, and when &s;he
might have lei&s;ure from other important cau&s;es of the

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the menacing and contemp|tuous
air of this &s;peech, the intrepid and indefatigable
Peter Wentworth, not di&s;couraged by his former ill
&s;ucce&s;s, ventured to tran&s;gre&s;s the imperial orders of
Elizabeth. He pre&s;ented to the lord keeper a petition,
in which he de&s;ired the upper hou&s;e to join with the
lower in a &s;upplication to her maje&s;ty, for entailing
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown; and declared, that he had
a bill ready prepared for that purpo&s;e. This method
of proceeding was &s;ufficiently re&s;pectful and cautious;
but the &s;ubject was always extremely di&s;agreeable to
the Queen, and what &s;he had expre&s;sly prohibited any
one to meddle with: She &s;ent Wentworth immediately
to the Tower; committed Sir Thomas Bromley, who
<PB N="379" REF="426">
had &s;econded him, to the Fleet pri&s;on, together with
Stevens, and Wel&s;h, two members, to whom Sir
Thomas had communicated his intention<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 470. Town&s;end, p. 54.</NOTE>. About a
fortnight after, a motion was made in the hou&s;e, to peti|tion
the Queen, for the relea&s;e of the&s;e members; but
it was an&s;wered by all the privy coun&s;ellors there pre|&s;ent,
that her maje&s;ty had committed them for cau&s;es
be&s;t known to her&s;elf, and that to pre&s;s her on that
head would only tend to the prejudice of the gentlemen
whom they meant to &s;erve: She would relea&s;e them
whenever &s;he thought proper, and would be better
plea&s;ed to do it of her own proper motion, than from
their &s;ugge&s;tion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 497.</NOTE>. The hou&s;e willingly acquie&s;ced in
this rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>So arbitrary an act, at the commencement of the &s;e&s;&s;i|on,
might well repre&s;s all farther attempts for freedom:
But the religious zeal for the puritans was not &s;o ea&s;ily
re&s;trained; and it in&s;pired a courage which no human
motive was able to &s;urmount. Morrice, attorney of

and after requiring him to deliver Morrice's bill
to her, &s;he told him, that it was in her power to call
Parliaments, in her power to di&s;&s;olve them, in her pow|er
to give a&s;&s;ent or di&s;&s;ent to any determination which
<PB N="380" REF="427">
they &s;hould form:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1593.</NOTE> That her purpo&s;e in &s;ummoning
this Parliament was twofold, to have laws enacted for
the farther enforcement of uniformity in religion, and
to provide for the defence of the nation, again&s;t the ex|orbitant
power of Spain: That the&s;e two points
ought, therefore, to be the object of their deliberation:
She had enjoined them already, by the mouth of the
lord keeper, to meddle neither with matters of &s;tate nor
of religion; and &s;he wondered how any one could be &s;o
a&s;&s;uming, as to attempt a &s;ubject &s;o expre&s;sly contrary
to her prohibition: That &s;he was highly offended with
this pre&s;umption; and took the pre&s;ent opportunity to
reiterate the commands given by the keeper, and to
require, that no bill, regarding either &s;tate affairs, or re|formation
in cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical, be exhibited in the
hou&s;e: And that in particular &s;he charged the &s;peaker
upon his allegiance, that if any &s;uch bills were offered,
ab&s;olutely to re&s;u&s;e them a reading, and not &s;o much
as permit them to be debated by the members<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 474, 478. Town&s;end, p. 68.</NOTE>. This
command from the Queen was &s;ubmitted to, without
farther que&s;tion. Morrice was &s;eized in the hou&s;e by
a &s;erjeant at arms, di&s;charged from his $ of chan|cellor
of the dutchy, di&s;abled from any prac$ in his
profe&s;&s;ion as a common lawyer, and kept for &s;ome
years pri&s;oner in Tilbury ca&s;tle<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Heylin's Hi&s;|tory of the Pre&s;byterian$, p. 320.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen having thus expre&s;sly pointed out,
both what the hou&s;e &s;hould and &s;hould not do, the com|mons
were as ob&s;equious to the one as to the other
of her injunctions. They pa&s;&s;ed a very &s;evere law
again&s;t recu&s;ants; &s;uch a law as was &s;uited to the &s;e|vere
character of Elizabeth and to the per&s;ecuting &s;pi|rit
of that age. It was intitled, An act to retain her
maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in their due obedience; and was meant,
as the preamble declares, to obviate &s;uch inconvenien|cies
and perils as might grow from the wicked practices
<PB N="381" REF="428">
of &s;editious &s;ectaries and di&s;loyal per&s;ons: For the&s;e
two &s;pecies of criminals were always, at that time,
confounded together, as equally dangerous to the peace
of &s;ociety. It was enacted, that any per&s;on, above &s;ix|teen
years of age, who ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, during the
&s;pace of a month, to attend the public wor&s;hip, &s;hould
be committed to pri&s;on; that, if after being condemn|ed
for this offence, he per&s;i&s;t three months in his refu|&s;al,
he mu&s;t abjure the realm; and that if he either re|&s;u&s;e
this condition, or return after bani&s;hment, he is to
&s;uffer capitally as a felon, without benefit of clergy<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">35 Eliz. c. 1.</NOTE>.
This law bore equally hard upon the puritans as upon
the catholics; and had it not been impo&s;ed by the
Queen's authority, was probably, in that re&s;pect, very
much contrary to the private &s;entiments and inclinati|ons
of the majority in the hou&s;e of commons. Very
little oppo&s;ition, however, appears there to have been
openly made to it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">After enacting this &s;tatute, the clergy, in order to remove the odium from them&s;elves, often took care that recu&s;ants &s;hould $e tried by the civil judges at the a&s;&s;izes, rather than by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ioners.

<P>THE expences of the war with Spain having re|duced
the Queen to great nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upply, the grant
of &s;ub&s;idies &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t important bu|&s;ine&s;s
of this Parliament; and it was a &s;ingular mark
of the high &s;pirit of Elizabeth, that, while con&s;cious
of a pre&s;ent dependance on the commons, &s;he opened
the &s;e&s;&s;ion with the mo&s;t haughty treatment of them,
and covered her weakne&s;s under &s;uch a lo&s;ty appear|ance
of &s;uperiority. The commons readily voted two
&s;ub&s;idies and four fifteenths; but this &s;um not appear|ing
&s;ufficient to the court, a very unu&s;ual expedient was
fallen upon to induce them to make an enlargement in
their conce&s;&s;ion. The peers informed the commons in
a conference, that they could not give their a&s;&s;ent to the
&s;upply voted, thinking it too &s;mall for the Queen's oc|occa&s;ions:
<PB N="382" REF="429">
They therefore propo&s;ed a grant of three
&s;ub&s;idies and &s;ix fifteenths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1593.</NOTE> and de&s;ired a conference, in
order to per&s;uade the commons to agree to this mea|&s;ure.
The commons, who had acquired the privilege
of beginning all bills of &s;ub&s;idy, took offence at this
procedure of the lords, and at fir&s;t ab&s;olutely rejected
the conference: But being afraid, on reflection, that
they had, by this refu&s;al, given offence to their &s;upe|riors,
they both agreed to the conference, and after|wards
voted the additional &s;ub&s;idy<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 483, 487, 488. Town&s;end, p. 66.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen, notwith&s;tanding this unu&s;ual conce&s;&s;ion
of the commons, ended the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, con|taining
&s;ome reprimands to them, and full of the &s;ame
high preten&s;ions, which &s;he had a&s;&s;umed at the open|ing
of the Parliament. She took notice, by the mouth
of the keeper, that &s;ome members &s;pent more time than
was nece&s;&s;ary, by indulging them&s;elves in harangues
and rea&s;onings: And &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her di&s;plea&s;ure on
account of their not paying their due reverence to pri|vy
coun&s;ellors, &startq;who,&endq; &s;he told them, &startq;were not
to be accounted as common knights and burge&s;&s;es
of the hou&s;e, who are coun&s;ellors but during the
Parliament: Whereas, the others are &s;tanding
coun&s;ellors, and for their wi&s;dom and great &s;ervice
are called to the council of the &s;tate<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 466. Town&s;end, p. 47.</NOTE>.&endq; The Queen
al&s;o, in her own per&s;on, made the Parliament a &s;pirited
harangue; in which &s;he &s;poke of the ju&s;tice and mo|deration
of her government, expre&s;&s;ed the &s;mall ambi|tion
&s;he had ever entertained of making conque&s;ts, dif|played
the ju&s;t grounds of her quarrel with the King
of Spain, and di&s;covered how little &s;he apprehended the
power of that monarch, even tho' he &s;hould make a
greater effort than that of his Invincible Armada.
&startq;But I am informed,&endq; added &s;he, &startq;that when he
attempted this la&s;t inva&s;ion, &s;ome upon the &s;ea-coa&s;ts
<PB N="383" REF="430">
for&s;ook their towns, fled up higher into the country,
and left all naked and expo&s;ed to his entrance: But
I &s;wear unto you, by God, if I knew tho&s;e per&s;ons,

make them feel what it is to be &s;o fearful in &s;o ur|gent
a cau&s;e<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 466. Town&s;end, p. 48.</NOTE>.&endq; By this menace, &s;he probably
gave the people to under&s;tand that &s;he would exerci&s;e
martial law upon &s;uch cowards: For there was no &s;ta|tute
by which a man could be puni&s;hed for changing
his place of abode.</P>
<P>THE King of France, tho' he had hitherto made
war on the League with great bravery and reputation,
tho' he had this campaign gained con&s;iderable advanta|ges
over them, and tho' he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a con&s;idera|rable
body of Engli&s;h under Norris, who carried ho&s;|tilities
into the heart of Britanny; was become &s;en&s;i|ble,
that he never could, by force of arms alone, render
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his kingdom. The nearer his mili|tary
&s;ucce&s;&s;es &s;eemed to approach him to a full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the throne, the more di&s;content and jealou&s;y aro&s;e
among tho&s;e Romani&s;ts who adhered to him; and a par|ty
was formed in his own court to elect &s;ome catholic
monarch of the royal blood, if Henry refu&s;ed any longer
to &s;atisfy them by declaring his conver&s;ion. This ex|cellent
prince was far from being a bigot to his fect;
and as he deemed the&s;e theological di&s;putes to be en|tirely
&s;ubordinate to the public good, he had tacitly de|termined,
from the beginning, to come, &s;ome time or
other, to the re&s;olution required of him. He had found,
on the death of his predece&s;&s;or, that the hugonots, who
formed the brave&s;t and mo&s;t faithful part of his army,
were &s;uch determined zealots, that, if he had, at that
time, abjured their faith, they would in&s;tantly have
abandoned him to the preten&s;ions and u&s;urpations of
the catholics. The more bigoted catholics, he knew,
particularly tho&s;e of the League, had entertained &s;uch
<PB N="384" REF="431">
an un&s;urmountable prejudice again&s;t his per&s;on, and
diffidence of his &s;incerity, that even his conver&s;ion
would not reconcile them to his title; and he mu&s;t ei|ther
expect to be entirely excluded from the throne, or
to be admitted to it on &s;uch terms as would leave him
little more than the mere &s;hadow of royalty. In this
delicate &s;ituation he had re&s;olved to temporize; to re|tain
the hugonots by continuing the profe&s;&s;ion of their
religion; to gain the moderate catholics by giving them
hopes of his conver&s;ion; to attach both to his per&s;on
by conduct and &s;ucce&s;s; and he hoped, either that the
animo&s;ity of war again&s;t the League would make them
drop gradually the que&s;tion of religion, or that he
might, in time, after &s;ome victories over his enemies
and &s;ome conferences with divines, make finally, with
more decency and dignity, that abjuration, which mu&s;t
have appeared, at fir&s;t, both mean and &s;u&s;picious to both
parties.</P>
<P>WHEN the people are attached to any theological te|nets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry
IV. embraces the catholic religion.</NOTE> merely from a general per&s;ua&s;ion or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
they are ea&s;ily induced, by any motive or authority, to
change their faith in the&s;e my&s;terious &s;ubjects; as ap|pears
from the example of the Engli&s;h, who, during
&s;ome reigns, generally embraced, without &s;cruple, the
&s;till varying religion of their &s;overeigns. But a nation,
like the French, where principles had &s;o long been di&s;|played
as the badges of faction, and where each party
had fortified its belief by an animo&s;ity again&s;t the other,
were not found &s;o pliable or incon&s;tant; and Henry
was at la&s;t convinced, that the catholics of his party
would entirely abandon him, if he gave them not im|mediate
&s;atisfaction in this particular. The hugonots
al&s;o, taught by experience, clearly &s;aw, that his defer|tion
of them was become entirely nece&s;&s;ary for the pub|lic
&s;ettlement; and &s;o general was this per&s;ua&s;ion among
them, that, the duke of Sully pretends, even the di|vines
of that party purpo&s;ely allowed them&s;elves to be
<PB N="385" REF="432">
overcome in the di&s;putes and conferences; that the
King might more readily be convinced of the weakne&s;s
of their cau&s;e, and might more cordially and &s;incerely,
at lea&s;t more decently, embrace the religion which it
was &s;o much his intere&s;t to believe. If this &s;elf-denial,
in &s;o tender a point, &s;hould appear incredible and &s;uper|natural
in theologians, it will, at lea&s;t, be thought very
natural, that a prince, &s;o little in&s;tructed in the&s;e points
as Henry, and &s;o de&s;irous to pre&s;erve his &s;incerity,
&s;hould in&s;en&s;ibly bend his opinion to the nece&s;&s;ity of
his affairs, and &s;hould believe that party to have the
be&s;t arguments, who could alone put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a kingdom. All circum&s;tances, therefore, being pre|pared
for this great event, that monarch renounced the
prote&s;tant religion, and was &s;olemnly received, by the
French prelates of his party, into the bo&s;om of the
church.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH, who was, her&s;elf, chiefly attached to
the prote&s;tants, by her intere&s;ts and the circum&s;tances
of her birth, and who &s;eems to have entertained &s;ome
propen&s;ity, during her whole life, to the catholic &s;u|per&s;tition,
at lea&s;t, to the antient ceremonies, yet pre|tended
to be extremely di&s;plea&s;ed with this abjuration
of Henry; and &s;he wrote him a very angry letter, re|proaching
him with this intere&s;ted change of his reli|gion.
Sen&s;ible, however, that the League and the
King of Spain were &s;till their common enemies, &s;he
hearkened to his apologies; continued her &s;uccours both
of men and money; and formed a new treaty, in which
they mutually &s;tipulated never to make peace but by
common agreement.</P>
<P>THE intrigues of Spain were not limited to France
and England:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE> The never failing pretence of religion,
joined to the influence of money, excited new di&s;orders
in Scotland, and gave fre&s;h alarms to Elizabeth.
George Ker, brother to the lord Newbottle, had been
taken, while he was making his pa&s;&s;age &s;ecretly into
<PB N="386" REF="433">
Spain; and &s;ome papers were found about him, by
which a dangerous con&s;piracy of &s;ome catholic noble|men
with Philip was di&s;covered. The earls of Angus,
Errol, and Huntley, the heads of three potent families,
had entered into a con&s;ederacy with the Spani&s;h mo|narch;
and had &s;tipulated to rai&s;e all their forces, to
join them to thirty thou&s;and Spani&s;h troops, which Phi|lip
engaged to &s;end into Scotland; and after re-e&s;tab|li&s;hing
the catholic religion in that kingdom, to march
with their united power, in order to effectuate the &s;ame
purpo&s;e in England<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 391. Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 190.</NOTE>. Graham of Fintry, who had
al&s;o entered into this con&s;piracy, was taken and ar|raigned,
and executed. Elizabeth &s;ent lord Borough
amba&s;&s;ador into Scotland, and exhorted the King to
exerci&s;e the &s;ame &s;everity on the three earls, to for|feit
their e&s;tates, and by annexing them to the crown,
both increa&s;e his own deme&s;nes, and &s;et an example to
all his &s;ubjects of the dangers attending trea&s;on and re|bellion.
This advice was certainly very rational, but
not ea&s;y to be executed by the &s;mall revenue and limit|ed
authority of James. He de&s;ired, therefore, &s;ome
&s;upply from her of men and money; but tho' &s;he had
rea&s;on to deem the pro&s;ecution of the three popi&s;h earls
a common cau&s;e, he never could obtain the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;|tance
from her. The tenth part of the expence, which
&s;he be&s;towed in &s;upporting the French King and the
States, would have &s;u&s;&s;iced to execute this purpo&s;e,
more immediately e&s;&s;ential to her &s;ecurity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 393. Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 235.</NOTE>: But &s;he
&s;eems ever to have borne &s;ome degree of malignity to
James, whom &s;he hated, both as her heir, and as the
&s;on of Mary, her hated rival and competitor. So far
from giving him a&s;&s;i&s;tance to pro&s;ecute the catholic con|&s;pirators,
&s;he rather contributed to his inquietude, by
countenancing the turbulent di&s;po&s;ition of the earl
<PB N="387" REF="434">
of Bothwel<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 257, 258.</NOTE>, a nobleman de&s;cended from a natural &s;on
of James the fifth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1594.</NOTE> Bothwel more than once attempt|ed
to render him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the King's per&s;on; and
being expelled the kingdom for the&s;e traiterous de&s;igns,
he took &s;helter in England, was &s;ecretly protected by
the Queen, and lurked near the borders, where his pow|er
lay, with a view of &s;till enterprizing &s;ome new vio|lence.
He &s;ucceeded at la&s;t in an attempt on the King;
and by the mediation of the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, im|po&s;ed
very di&s;honourable terms upon that prince: But
James, with the authority of the convention of &s;tates,
annulled this agreement as impo&s;ed by violence; again
expelled Bothwel the country; and obliged him to take
&s;helter in England. Elizabeth, pretending ignorance
of the place of his retreat, never executed the treaties,
by which &s;he was bound to deliver up all rebels and fu|gitives
to the King of Scotland. During the&s;e di&s;or|ders,
encrea&s;ed by the refractory di&s;po&s;ition of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics,
the pro&s;ecution of the catholic earls remain|ed
in &s;u&s;pence; but at la&s;t the Parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act
of attainder again&s;t them, and the King prepared him|&s;elf
to execute it by force of arms. The noblemen,
tho' they obtained a victory over the earl of Argyle,
who acted by the King's commi&s;&s;ion, found them&s;elves
hard pre&s;&s;ed by James him&s;elf, and agreed, on certain
terms, to leave the kingdom. Bothwel, being detect|ed
in a con&s;ederacy with them, forfeited the favour of
Elizabeth, and was obliged to take &s;helter, fir&s;t in
France, then in Italy, where he died, &s;ome years after,
in great poverty.</P>
<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hed authority of the Queen &s;ecured her
from all &s;uch attempts as James was expo&s;ed to from
the mutinous di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;ubjects; and her ene|mies
found no other means of giving her any dome&s;tic
di&s;turbance than by &s;uch traiterous and per&s;idious
machinations, as ended in their own di&s;grace, and in
<PB N="388" REF="435">
the ruin of their criminal in&s;truments. Roderigo
Lopez, a Jew, dome&s;tic phy&s;ician to the Queen, being
impri&s;oned on &s;u&s;picion, confe&s;&s;ed, that he had recei|ed
a bribe to poi&s;on her from Fuentes and Ibarra, who
had &s;ucceeded Parma, lately decea&s;ed, in the govern|ment
of the Netherlands; but he maintained, that he
had no other intention than to cheat Philip of his money,
and never meant to fulfil his promi&s;e. He was,
however, executed for the con&s;piracy; and the Queen
complained to Philip of the&s;e di&s;honourable attempts of
his mini&s;ters, but could obtain no &s;atisfaction<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 577. Birch's Negot. p. 15. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 381.</NOTE>. York
and Williams, two Engli&s;h traitors, were afterwards
executed for a like con&s;piracy with Ibarra<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 582.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of revenging her&s;elf, by retaliating in this
&s;hameful manner, Elizabeth fought a more honourable
vengeance, by &s;upporting the King of France, and
a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in finally breaking the force of the League,
which, after the conver&s;ion of that monarch, went
daily to decay, and was threatned with &s;peedy ruin and
di&s;&s;olution. Norris commanded the Engli&s;h forces in
Britanny, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the taking of Morlaix, Quim|percorentin,
and Bre&s;t, towns guarded by Spani&s;h for|ces
in that province. In every action, the Engli&s;h,
tho' they had &s;o long enjoyed domi&s;tic peace, di&s;cover|ed
a &s;trong military di&s;po&s;ition; and the Queen, tho'
her&s;elf a heroine, found more frequent occa&s;ion to re|prove
her generals for encouraging their temerity, than
for countenancing their fear or caution<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 578.</NOTE>. Sir Martin
Forbi&s;her, her brave admiral, peri&s;hed, with many
others, before Bre&s;t. Morlaix had been promi&s;ed the
Engli&s;h for a place of retreat; but the duke d'Aumont,
the French general, eluded this promi&s;e by making it
to be in&s;erted in the capitulation, that none but catholics
&s;hould be admitted into that city.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="436">
NEXT campaign, the French King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1595.</NOTE>
long carried on ho&s;tilities with Philip, was at la&s;t
provoked, by the taking of Chatelet and Dourlens,
and the attack of Cambray, to declare war again&s;t
that monarch. Elizabeth, being threatned with a new
inva&s;ion in England, and with an in&s;urrection in Ire|land,
recalled mo&s;t of her forces, and &s;ent Norris to
command in this latter kingdom. Finding al&s;o, that
the French League was almo&s;t entirely di&s;&s;olved, and
that the mo&s;t con&s;iderable leaders had made an accommo|dation
with their prince, &s;he thought that he could well
&s;upport him&s;elf by his own force and valour, and &s;he
began to be more &s;paring in his cau&s;e, of the blood and
trea&s;ure of her &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>SOME di&s;gu&s;ts, which &s;he had received from the
&s;tates, joined to the remon&s;trances of her frugal mini&s;|ter,
Burleigh, made her al&s;o inclined to dimini&s;h her
charges on that &s;ide; and &s;he even demanded, by her
amba&s;&s;ador, Sir Thomas Bodley, to be reimbur&s;ed all
the money, which &s;he had expended in &s;upporting
them. The &s;tates, be&s;ides alledging the conditions
of the former treaty, by which they were not bound to
repay her, till the conclu&s;ion of a peace, pleaded
their pre&s;ent poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, the great &s;uperiori|ty
of the Spaniards, and the difficulty of &s;upporting the
war; much more, of &s;aving money to di&s;charge their
incumbrances. After much negotiation, a new treaty
was at la&s;t fromed; by which the &s;tates engaged to
free the Queen immediately from the charge of the
Engli&s;h auxiliaries, computed at forty thou&s;and pounds
a year, to pay her annually twenty thou&s;and pounds
a years, to pay her annually twenty thousand pounds for
&s;ome years, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her with a certain number of &s;hips.
and to conclude no peace nor treaty without her con|&s;ent.
They al&s;o bound them&s;elves, on the conclu&s;ion
of the peace with Spain, to pay her annually the &s;um
of an hundred thou&s;and pounds for four years; but on
this condition, that the payment &s;hould be in lieu of all
debts, and that they &s;hould be &s;upplied, tho' at their

<P>THE Queen &s;till retained in her hands the cautiona|ry
towns, which were a great check on the ri&s;ing
power of the &s;tates; and &s;he committed the important
charge of Flu&s;hing to Sir Francis Vere, a brave officer,
who had been much di&s;tingui&s;hed by his valour in the
Low Countries. She gave this gentleman the prefer|ence
to E&s;&s;ex, who expected &s;o honourable a command;
and tho' that earl was daily ri&s;ing both in reputation
with the people, and favour with her&s;elf, the Queen,
who was commonly re&s;erved in the advancement of
her courtiers, thought proper, on this occa&s;ion, to give
him a refu&s;al. Sir Thomas Ba&s;kerville was &s;ent over
to France at the head of two thou&s;and Engli&s;h, with
which Elizabeth, by a new treaty, concluded with
Henry, engaged to &s;upply that prince. Some &s;tipula|tions
for mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance were formed by the treaty;
and all the former engagements were renewed.</P>
<P>THIS body of Engli&s;h troops were maintained at the
expence of the French King;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1597.</NOTE> yet did Henry e&s;teem
this &s;upply of con&s;iderable advantage, on account of
the great reputation acquired by the Engli&s;h, in &s;o
many fortunate enterprizes, undertaken again&s;t the
common enemy. In the great battle of Turnhoult,
gained this campaign by prince Maurice, the Engli&s;h
auxiliaries under Sir Francis Vere and Sir Robert Sid|ney
had extremely di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves; and the
fortunate &s;ucce&s;s of that day was univer&s;ally a&s;cribed to
their di&s;cipline and valour.</P>
<P>THO'<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naval enterprizes.</NOTE> Elizabeth, at a great expence of blood and
trea&s;ure, made war again&s;t Philip in France and the
Low Countries, the mo&s;t &s;evere blows which &s;he gave
the Spani&s;h greatne&s;s, were owing to tho&s;e naval enter|prizes,
which either &s;he or her &s;ubjects &s;carce ever in|termitted
during one &s;ea&s;on. In 1594, Richard Haw|kins,
<PB N="391" REF="438">
&s;on to Sir John, the famous navigator, pro|cured
the Queen's commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ailed with three
&s;hips to the South Sea by the &s;traits of Magellan: But
his voyage proved unfortunate, and he him&s;elf was
taken pri&s;oner on the coa&s;t of Chili. James Lanca&s;ter
was &s;upplyed the &s;ame year with three &s;hips and a pin|nace
by the merchants of London; and was more
$$rtunate in his adventures. He took thirty-nine &s;hips
of the enemy; and not contented with this &s;ucce&s;s, he
made an attempt on Fernambouc in Brazil, where,
he knew, great trea&s;ures were at that time lodged. As
he approached the land, he &s;aw it lined with great num|bers
of the enemy; but no-wife daunted with this
appearance, he placed the &s;toute&s;t of his men in boats,
and ordered them to row with &s;uch violence again&s;t the
&s;hore as to &s;plit them in pieces. By this bold action,
he both deprived his men of all hopes of &s;aving them|&s;elves
but by victory, and terrified the enemy, who
fled after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance. He returned home &s;afely
with the trea&s;ure, which he had &s;o bravely acquired.
In 1595, Sir Walter Raleigh, who had anew forfeited
the Queen's friend&s;hip by an intrigue with one of the
maids of honour, and who had been confined in pri|&s;on
for this mi&s;demeanor, no &s;ooner recovered his liber|ty
than he was pu&s;hed by his active and enterprizing
genius to attempt &s;ome great action. The &s;ucce&s;s of
the fir&s;t Spani&s;h adventures again&s;t Mexico and Peru
had begot an extreme avidity in Europe; and a pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
univer&s;ally took place, that in the inland parts
of South America, called Guiana, a country as yet
undi&s;covered, there were mines and trea&s;ures and riches
far exceeding any thing which Cortes or Pizarro had
met with. Raleigh, who&s;e turn of mind was &s;ome|what
romantic and extravagant, undertook at his own
charge the di&s;covery of this wonderful country. Hav|ing
taken the &s;mall town of St. Jo&s;eph in the i&s;le of
Trin$$ado, where he found no riches, he left his &s;hip,
<PB N="392" REF="439">
and &s;ailed up the river Oroonoko in pinnaces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1597.</NOTE> but with|out
meeting with any thing to an&s;wer his expectations.
On his return, he publi&s;hed an account of this country,
full of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t palpable lies, that were ever
attempted to be impo&s;ed on the credulity of mankind<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 584.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame year, Sir Francis Drake and Sir John
Hawkins undertook a more important expedition
again&s;t the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in America; and they
carried with them &s;ix &s;hips of the Queen's and twenty
more, which they had either fitted out at their own
charges, or which were furni&s;hed them by private ad|venturers.
Sir Thomas Ba&s;kerville was appointed com|mander
of the land forces, which they carried on board,
Their fir&s;t de&s;ign was to attempt Porto Rico, where,
they knew, a rich carrack was at that time &s;tationed;
but as they had not pre&s;erved the requi&s;ite &s;ecrecy, a
pinnace, having &s;trayed from the fleet, was taken by
the Spaniards, and betrayed the intentions of the Engli&s;h,
Preparations were made in that i&s;land to receive them; and
the Engli&s;h fleet, notwith&s;tanding the brave a&s;&s;ault, which
they made on the enemy, was repul&s;ed with lo&s;s. Haw|kins
&s;oon after died; and Drake pur&s;ued his cour&s;e to
to Nombre di Dios, on the i&s;thmus of Darien; where,
having landed his men, he attempted to pa&s;s forward
to Panama, with a view of plundering that place, or,
if he found &s;uch a &s;cheme practicable, of keeping and
fortifying it. But he met not with the &s;ame facility,
which had attended his fir&s;t enterprizes in the&s;e parts.
The Spaniards, taught by experience, had every where
fortified the pa&s;&s;es, and had &s;tationed troops in the
woods; who &s;o infe&s;ted the Engli&s;h by continual
alarms and &s;kirmi&s;hes, that they were obliged to re|turn,
without being able to effectuate any thing.
Drake him&s;elf, from the intemperance of the climate,
from the fatigues of his journey, and from the vexation
of his di&s;appointment, was &s;eized with a di&s;temper, of
<PB N="393" REF="440">
which he &s;oon after died. Sir Thomas Ba&s;kerville
took the command of the fleet, which was in a very
weak condition; and after having fought a battle near
Cuba with a Spani&s;h fleet, of which the event was not
deci&s;ive, he returned to England. The Spaniards &s;uf|fered
&s;ome lo&s;s from this enterprize; but the Engli&s;h
reaped no profit<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE bad &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize in the Indies
made the Engli&s;h rather attempt the Spani&s;h dominions
in Europe, where, they heard, Philip was making great
preparations for a new inva&s;ion of England. A power|ful
fleet was equipped at Plymouth con&s;i&s;ting of an
hundred and &s;eventy ve&s;&s;els, &s;eventeen of which were
capital &s;hips of war; the re&s;t tenders and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els:
Twenty &s;hips were added by the Hollanders. In this
fleet there were computed to be &s;ix thou&s;and three
hundred and &s;ixty &s;oldiers, a thou&s;and volunteers, and
&s;ix thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-two &s;eamen,
be&s;ide the Dutch. The land forces were commanded
by the earl of E&s;&s;ex. The navy by lord Effingham,
high admiral. Both the&s;e commanders had expended
great &s;ums of their own in this armament: For &s;uch was
the &s;pirit of Elizabeth's reign. The lord Thomas
Howard, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Vere, Sir
George Carew, and Sir Coniers Clifford had com|mands
in this expedition, and were named as a council
to the general and admiral<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 591.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fleet &s;et &s;ail on the fir&s;t of June 1596; and
meeting with a fair wind, bent their cour&s;e to Cadiz,
at which place, by &s;ealed orders delivered to all the
captains, the general rende&s;vous was appointed. They
&s;ent before them &s;ome armed tenders, which intercept|ed
every &s;hip, that could carry intelligence to the
enemy; and they them&s;elves were &s;o fortunate when
they came near Cadiz, as to take an Iri&s;h ve&s;&s;el, by
which they learned, that that port was full of mer|chant
<PB N="394" REF="441">
&s;hips of great value, and that the Spaniards
lived in perfect &s;ecurity, without any apprehen&s;ions of
an enemy. This intelligence much encouraged the
Engli&s;h fleet, and gave them the pro&s;pect of a fortunate
i&s;&s;ue to the enterprize.</P>
<P>AFTER a fruitle&s;s attempt to land at St. Seba&s;tians
on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the i&s;land of Cadiz; it was,
upon deliberation, re&s;olved by the council of war to at|tack
the &s;hips and gallies in the bay. This attempt was
deemed very ra&s;h; and the lord admiral him&s;elf, who
was cautious in his temper, had entertained great
&s;cruples with regard to it: But E&s;&s;ex &s;trenuou&s;ly urged
the enterprize; and when he found the re&s;olution at
la&s;t taken, he threw his hat into the &s;ea, and gave &s;ymp|toms
of the mo&s;t extravagant joy. He felt, however,
a great mortification, when Effingham informed him,
that the Queen, who was anxious for his &s;afety, and
who dreaded the effects of his youthful ardour, had
&s;ecretly given orders, that he &s;hould not be permitted
to command the van in the attack<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 196.</NOTE>. That duty was
performed by Sir Walter Raleigh and the lord Tho|mas
Howard; but E&s;&s;ex no &s;ooner came within reach
of the enemy, than he forgot the promi&s;e which the
admiral had exacted of him to keep in the mid&s;t of the
fleet; He broke thro' and pre&s;&s;ed forward into the
thicke&s;t of the fire. Emulation for glory, avidity of
plunder, animo&s;ity again&s;t the Spaniards proved incen|tives
to every one; and the enemy were &s;oon obliged
to &s;lip anchor, and retreat farther into the bay, where
they ran many of their &s;hips aground. E&s;&s;ex then land|ed
his men at the fort of Puntal; and immediately
marched to the attack of Cadiz, which the impetuous
valour of the Engli&s;h &s;oon carried &s;word in hand. The
genero&s;ity of E&s;&s;ex, which was not inferior to his
valour, made him &s;top the &s;laughter, and treat his
pri&s;oners with the greate&s;t humanity, and even affabili|ty
<PB N="395" REF="442">
and kindne&s;s. The Engli&s;h made rich plunder in
the city;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1597.</NOTE> but mi&s;&s;ed of a much richer by the re&s;oluti|on,
which the duke of Medina, the Spani&s;h admiral,
took, of &s;etting fire to the &s;hips, in order to prevent
their falling into the hands of the enemy. It was com|puted,
that the lo&s;s, which the Spaniards &s;u&s;tained in
this enterprize, amounted to twenty millions of du|cats<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 97.</NOTE>; be&s;ides the indignity, which that proud and
ambitious people received, from the taking one of their
chief cities, and de&s;troying in their harbour a fleet of
&s;uch force and value.</P>
<P>ESSEX, all on fire for glory, regarded this great &s;uc|ce&s;s
only as a &s;tep to future atchievements: He in&s;i&s;ted
on the keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cadiz, and he undertook
with four hundred men and three months provi&s;ions,
to defend the place till &s;uccours &s;hould arrive from En|gland.
But all the other &s;eamen and &s;oldiers were &s;a|tisfied
with the honour which they had acquired; and
were impatient to return home, in order to &s;ecure their
plunder. Every other propo&s;al of E&s;&s;ex to annoy the
enemy, met with a like reception; his &s;cheme for in|tercepting
the carracks at the Azores, for a&s;&s;aulting
the Groyne, for taking St. Andero, and St. Seba&s;tian:
And the Engli&s;h, finding &s;o great difficulty to drag this
impatient warrior from the enemy, at la&s;t left him on
the Spani&s;h coa&s;t, attended with very few &s;hips. He
complained much to the Queen, of their want of &s;pirit
in this enterprize; nor was &s;he plea&s;ed, that they had
returned without attempting to intercept the Indian
fleet<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 121.</NOTE>; but the great &s;ucce&s;s in the enterprize on Ca|diz,
had covered all their mi&s;carriages: And that prin|ce&s;s,
tho' &s;he admired the lofty genius of E&s;&s;ex, could
not forbear expre&s;&s;ing an e&s;teem for the other officers<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 593.</NOTE>.
The admiral was created earl of Nottingham; and his
promotion gave great di&s;gu&s;t to E&s;&s;ex<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sydney Papers, vol. II. 77.</NOTE>. In the pre|amble
<PB N="396" REF="443">
of the patent it was &s;aid, that the new dignity
was conferred on him, on account of his good &s;ervices
in taking Cadiz, and de&s;troying the Spani&s;h &s;hips; a
merit which E&s;&s;ex pretended to belong &s;olely to him|&s;elf:
And he offered to maintain this plea by &s;ingle
combat again&s;t the earl of Nottingham, or his &s;ons, or
any of his kindred.</P>
<P>THE atchievements in the &s;ub&s;equent year proved
not &s;o fortunate; but, as the Indian fleet very narrow|ly
e&s;caped the Engli&s;h, Philip had &s;till rea&s;on to &s;ee the
great hazard and di&s;advantage of that war in which he
was engaged, and the &s;uperiority which the Engli&s;h,
by thier naval power, and their &s;ituation, had acquired
over him. The Queen, having received intelligence,
that the Spaniards, tho' their fleets were &s;o much &s;hat|tered
and de&s;troyed, by the expedition at Cadiz, were
preparing a &s;quadron at Ferrol and the Groyne, and
were marching troops thither, with a view of making
an inva&s;ion on Ireland, was re&s;olved to prevent their en|terprize,
and to de&s;troy the &s;hipping in the&s;e harbours.
She prepared a large fleet of a hundred and twenty
&s;ail, of which &s;eventeen were her own &s;hips, forty|three
were &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, and the re&s;t tenders and vic|tuallers:
She embarked on board this fleet five thou|&s;and
new-levied &s;oldiers, and added a thou&s;and veteran
troops, whom Sir Francis Vere brought from the Ne|therlands.
The earl of E&s;&s;ex, commander in chief,
both of the land and &s;ea forces, was at the head of one
&s;quadron: Lord Thomas Howard was appointed vice|admiral
of another; Sir Walter Raleigh of the third:
Lord Mountjoy commanded the land forces under E&s;|&s;ex:
Vere was appointed mar&s;hal: Sir George Carew
lieutenant of the ordnance, and Sir Chri&s;topher Blount
fir&s;t colonel. The earls of Rutland and Southampton,
the lords Grey, Cromwel, and Rich, with &s;everal other
per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, attended as volunteers. E&s;&s;ex
declared his re&s;olution, either to de&s;troy the new Ar|mada,
<PB N="397" REF="444">
which threatned England, or to peri&s;h in the
attempt.</P>
<P>THIS powerful fleet &s;et ail from Plymouth; but
were no &s;ooner out of the harbour than they met with
a furious &s;torm, which &s;hattered and di&s;per&s;ed them;
and before they could be refitted, E&s;&s;ex found, that
their provi&s;ions were &s;o far &s;pent, that it would not be
&s;afe to carry &s;o numerous an army along with him. He
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, therefore, all the &s;oldiers, except the thou|&s;and
veterans under vere; and laying a&s;ide all thoughts
of attacking Ferrol or the Groyne, he confined the
object of his expedition to the intercepting the Indian
fleet; which had at fir&s;t been con&s;idered only as the
&s;econd enterprize which he was to attempt.</P>
<P>THE Indian fleet, in that age, by rea&s;on of the im|perfection
of navigation, had a &s;tated cour&s;e, as well as
&s;ea&s;on, both in their going out and in their return; and
there were certain i&s;lands, at which, as at fixed &s;tages,
they always touched, and where they took in water
and provi&s;ions. The Azores, being one of the&s;e pla|ces
where, about this time, the fleet was expected, E&s;|&s;ex
bent his cour&s;e thither; and he informed Raleigh,
that he, on his arrival, intended to attack Fayal, one
of the&s;e i&s;lands. By &s;ome accident the &s;quadrons were
&s;eparated; and Raleigh arriving fir&s;t before Fayal,
thought it more prudent, after waiting &s;ome time for
the general, to begin the attack alone, le&s;t the inhabi|tants
&s;hould, by farther delay, have leizure to make
greater preparations for their defence. He &s;ucceeded
in the enterprize; but E&s;&s;ex, jealous of Raleigh, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
great di&s;plea&s;ure at this conduct, and con&s;tru|ed
it as an intention of robbing the general of the glo|ry
which attended that action: He ca&s;hiered, therefore,
Sydney, Bret, Berry, and others, who had concurred
in the attempt; and would have proceeded to inflict
the &s;ame puni&s;hment on Raleigh him&s;elf, had not lord
Thomas Howard interpo&s;ed with his good offices, and
<PB N="398" REF="445">
per&s;uaded Raleigh, tho' very high-&s;pirited, to make &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions
to the general. E&s;&s;ex, who was placable, as
well as ha&s;ty and pa&s;&s;ionate, was &s;oon appea&s;ed, and
both received Raleigh into favour, and re&s;tored the
other officers to their commands<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 173.</NOTE>. This incident$
however, tho' the quarrel was &s;eemingly accommodated,
laid the fir&s;t foundation of that violent animo&s;ity which
afterwards took place between the&s;e two gallant com|manders.</P>
<P>ESSEX
made next a di&s;po&s;ition proper for intercept|ing
the Indian galleons; and Sir William Mon&s;on,
who&s;e &s;tation was the mo&s;t remote of the fleet, having
fallen in with them, made the &s;ignals which had been
agreed on. That able officer here a&s;cribes E&s;&s;ex's fai|lure
of &s;ucce&s;s, when he was &s;o near attaining &s;o migh|ty
an advantage, to his want of experience in &s;eaman|&s;hip;
and the account which he gives of the errors
committed by that nobleman, appears very rea&s;onable
as well as candid<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 174.</NOTE>. The Spani&s;h fleet, finding that
their enemy was upon them, made all the &s;ail po&s;&s;ible
to the Terceras, and got into the &s;afe and well forti|fied
harbour of Angra, before the Engli&s;h fleet could
overtake them. E&s;&s;ex intercepted only three &s;hips;
which, however, were &s;o rich as to repay all the char|ges
of the expedition.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es of this mi&s;carriage of E&s;&s;ex's enterprize,
were much canva&s;&s;ed in England, upon the return of
the fleet; and tho' the courtiers took party differently,
as they affected either E&s;&s;ex or Raleigh, the people, in
general, who bore an extreme affection to the gallan|try,
&s;pirit, and genero&s;ity of the former, were inclined
to ju&s;tify every circum&s;tance of his conduct. The
Queen, who loved the one as much as &s;he e&s;teemed the
other, maintained a kind of neutrality, and endeavour|ed
to &s;hare her favours with an impartial hand between
the parties. Sir Robert Cecil, &s;econd &s;on to lord Bur|leigh,
<PB N="399" REF="446">
was a courtier of very promi&s;ing hopes, much
connected with Raleigh; and &s;he made him &s;ecretary
of &s;tate, in&s;tead of Sir Thomas Bodley, whom E&s;&s;ex
recommended for that office. But not to di&s;gu&s;t E&s;&s;ex
by this preference, &s;he promoted him to the dignity of
earl mar&s;hal of England, an office which had been va|cant
ever &s;ince the death of the earl of Shrew&s;bury.
E&s;&s;ex might perceive from this conduct, that &s;he never
intended to give him the entire a&s;eendant over his rivals,
and might learn thence the nece&s;&s;ity of moderation and
caution. But his temper was too high for &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion;
his behaviour too open and candid to practice the arts
of a court; and his free &s;allies, while they rendered him
only more amiable in the eyes of good judges, gave his
enemies many advantages again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE war with Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th October.</NOTE> tho' &s;ucce&s;sful, having exhau&s;t|ed

care, by the mouth of Sir Thomas Egerton, lord keep|er,
to inform this a&s;&s;embly of the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upply.
She &s;aid, that the wars formerly waged in Europe, had
commonly been conducted by the parties without far|ther
view than to gain a few towns, or at mo&s;t a pro|vince,
from each other; but the object of the pre&s;ent

to bereave England of her religion, her liberty,

<P>THE

a prelude to tho&s;e encroachments which, as they a&s;&s;u|med
more courage, they afterwards made upon the
prerogatives of the crown. They complained, that
the lords failed in civility to them, by receiving their

of this innovation to the peers. The peers replied,
that they expected not &s;uch a frivolous objection from
the gravity of the hou&s;e; and that it was not material,
whether the amendments were wr$e on parchment or
on paper, nor whether the paper was white, black, or

<P>ELIZABETH had rea&s;on to fore&s;ee, that parliamenta|ry
&s;upplies would now become more nece&s;&s;ary to her
than ever; and that the chief burthen of the war with
Spain would thenceforth lie on England. Henry had
received an overture for a peace with Philip; but before
he would proceed to a negociation, he gave intelligence
of it to his allies the Queen and the States; that, if po&s;&s;i|ble,
a general pacification might be made by common
con&s;ent and agreement. The&s;e two powers &s;ent am|ba&s;&s;adors
to France, in order to remon&s;trate again&s;t
peace with Spain; the Queen, Sir Robert Cecil, and
Henry Herbert; the States, Ju&s;tin Na&s;&s;au, and John
Barnevelt. Henry &s;aid to the&s;e mini&s;ters, that his mo&s;t
early education had been amid&s;t war and danger, and
he had pa&s;&s;ed the whole cour&s;e of his life either in arms
or in military preparations: That after the proofs
which he had given of his alacrity in the field, no one
could doubt, but he would willingly, for his part, have
continued in a cour&s;e of life, to which he was now
habituated, till the common enemy was reduced to
&s;uch a condition as no longer to give umbrage either
to him or to his allies: That no private intere&s;t of his
own, not even that of his people, nothing but the mo&s;t
inevitable nece&s;&s;ity, could ever induce him to think of
a &s;eparate peace with Philip, or make him embrace
mea&s;ures which were not entirely formed with the ap|probation
of all his con&s;ederates: That his kingdom,
torne with the convul&s;ions and civil wars of near half
a century, required &s;ome interval of repo&s;e, ere it could
reach a condition in which it might &s;u&s;tain it&s;elf, much
more &s;upport its allies: That after the minds of his
&s;ubjects were compo&s;ed to tranquillity and accu&s;tomed
to obedience, after his finances were brought into order,
<PB N="403" REF="450">
and after agriculture and the arts were re&s;tored<NOTE PLACE="marg">1598.</NOTE>, France,
in&s;tead of being a burthen, as at pre&s;ent, to her con|federates,
would be able to lend them effectual &s;uccours,
and amply to repay them all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which &s;he
had received during her calamities: And that if the
ambition of Spain would not at pre&s;ent grant them &s;uch
terms as they &s;hould think rea&s;onable, he hoped, that,
in a little time, he &s;hould attain &s;uch a &s;ituation as
would enable him to mediate more effectually, and with
more deci&s;ive authority, in their behalf.</P>
<P>THE amba&s;&s;adors were &s;en&s;ible, that the&s;e rea&s;ons
were not feigned; and they therefore remon&s;trated with
the lefs vehemence again&s;t the mea&s;ures which, they
&s;aw, Henry was determined to pur&s;ue. The States
knew, that that monarch was intere&s;ted never to per|mit
their final r$in; and having received private a&s;&s;ur|ances,
that he would &s;till, notwith&s;tanding the peace,
give them a&s;&s;i&s;tance both of men and money, they were
well plea&s;ed to remain on terms of amity with him.
His greate&s;t concern was to give &s;atisfaction to Eliza|beth
for this breach of treaty. He had a cordial e&s;teem
for that prince&s;s, a &s;ympathy of manners, and a gra|titude
for the extraordinary favours which he had re|ceived
from her, during his greate&s;t difficulties: And
he u&s;ed every expedient to apologize and atone for that
mea&s;ure, which nece&s;&s;ity extorted from him. But as
Spain refu&s;ed to treat with the Dutch as a free &s;tate, and
Elizabeth would not negotiate without her ally, Henry
found him&s;elf obliged to conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Vervins.</NOTE> at Vervins, a &s;epa|rate
peace, by which he recovered po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the
places &s;eized by Spain during the cour&s;e of the civil
wars, and procured him&s;elf leizure to attend to the do|me&s;tic
&s;ettlement of his kingdom. His capacity for
the arts of peace were not inferior to his military ta|lents;
and, in a little time, by his frugality, order, and
wi&s;e government, he rai&s;ed France, from the de&s;olation
and mi&s;ery in which &s;he was at pre&s;ent involved, to a
<PB N="404" REF="451">
more flouri&s;hing condition than &s;he had ever before
enjoyed.</P>
<P>THE Queen knew, that it would be al&s;o in her
power, whenever &s;he plea&s;ed, to conclude the war on
equitable terms, and that Philip, having no preten|&s;ions
upon her, would be glad to free him&s;elf from an
enemy who had foiled him in every conte&s;t, and who
had it &s;till &s;o much in her power to make him feel the
weight of her arms. Some of her wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;ellors,
particularly the lord trea&s;urer, advi&s;ed her to embrace
pacific mea&s;ures; and &s;et before her the advantages of
tranquillity, &s;ecurity, and frugality, as more con&s;ider
able than any &s;ucce&s;s which could attend the greate&s;t
victories. But that high-&s;pirited prince&s;s, though &s;he
was at fir&s;t aver&s;e to the war, &s;eemed now to have
attained &s;uch an a&s;cendant over the enemy, that &s;he
was unwilling to &s;top the cour&s;e of her pro&s;perous
fortune. She con&s;idered, that her &s;ituation, and her
pa&s;t victories, had given her entire &s;ecurity again&s;t any
dangerous inva&s;ion; and the war mu&s;t henceforth be
conducted by &s;udden enterprizes, and naval expeditions,
in which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an undoubted &s;uperiority: That
the weak condition of Philip in the Indies opened to
her the view of the mo&s;t de&s;irable advantages; and the
yearly return of his trea&s;ure by &s;ea, afforded a conti|nual
pro&s;pect of important, though more temporary,
&s;ucce&s;&s;es: That, after his peace with France, if &s;he
al&s;o &s;hould con&s;ent to an accommodation, he would
be able to turn all his force again&s;t the revolted pro|vinces
of the Netherlands, which, though they had
&s;urprizingly increa&s;ed their power by commerce and
good government, were &s;till unable, if not &s;upported
by their confederates, to maintain the war again&s;t &s;o
mighty a monarchy: And that as her defence of that
commonwealth was the original ground of the quarrel,
it was un&s;afe, as well as di&s;honourable, to abandon
<PB N="405" REF="452">
their cau&s;e, till &s;he had placed them in a &s;tate of greater
&s;ecurity.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons were frequently inculcated on her
by the earl of E&s;&s;ex, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for glory, as well as
his military talents, made him earne&s;tly de&s;ire the con|tinuance
of that war from which he expected to reap
&s;o much advantage and di&s;tinction. The rival&s;hip
between this nobleman and lord Burleigh, made each
of them in&s;i&s;t the more &s;trenuou&s;ly on his own coun|cils;
and as E&s;&s;ex's per&s;on was agreeable to the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of E&s;&s;ex.</NOTE>
as well as his advice conformable to her inclinations,
the favourite &s;eemed daily to acquire an a&s;cendant
over the mini&s;ter. Had he been endowed with caution
and &s;elf-command, equal to his &s;hining qualities, he
would have &s;o riveted him&s;elf in the Queen's con|fidence,
that none of his enemies had ever been able to
impeach his credit: But his lofty &s;pirit could ill &s;ubmit
to that implicit deference which her temper required,
and which &s;he had ever been accu&s;tomed to receive
from all her &s;ubjects. Being once engaged in a di&s;pute
with her about the choice of a governor for Ireland, he
was &s;o heated in the argument, that he entirely forgot
the rules both of duty and civility; and turned his back
upon her in a contemptuous manner. Her anger,
which was naturally prompt and violent, ro&s;e at this
provocation; and &s;he in&s;tantly gave him a box on the
the ear; adding a pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ion, &s;uited to his
impertinence. In&s;tead of recollecting him&s;elf, and
making the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions due to her &s;ex and &s;tation, he
clapped his hand to his &s;word, and &s;wore he would not
hear &s;uch u&s;age, were it from Henry the eighth him|&s;elf;
and, in a great pa&s;&s;ion, he immediately with|drew
from court. Egerton, the chancellor, who loved
E&s;&s;ex, exhorted him to repair his indi&s;cretion by pro|per
acknowlegements; and entreated him not to give
that triumph to his enemies, that affliction to his friends,
<PB N="406" REF="453">
which mu&s;t en&s;ue by his &s;upporting a conte&s;t with his
&s;overeign, and de&s;erting the &s;ervice of his country:
But E&s;&s;ex was deeply &s;tung with the di&s;honour which
he had received; and &s;eemed to think, that an in&s;ult,
which might be pardoned a woman, was become a
mortal affront when it came from his &s;overeign. &startq;If
the vile&s;t of all indignities,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;is done me,
does religion enforce me to &s;ue for pardon? Doth
God require it? Is it impiety not to do it? Why?
Cannot princes err? Cannot &s;ubjects receive wrong?
Is an earthly power infinite? Pardon me, my lord,
I can never &s;ub&s;cribe to the&s;e principles. Let Solo|mon's
fool laugh when he is &s;tricken; let tho&s;e that
mean to make their profit of princes, &s;hew no &s;en&s;e
of princes' injuries: Let them acknowleged an infinite
ab&s;olutene&s;s on earth, that do not believe an ab&s;o|lute
Infinitene&s;s in heaven.&endq; (alluding, probably, to
the character and conduct of Sir Walter Raleigh, who
lay under the reproach of impiety) &startq;As for me,&endq;
continued he, &startq;I have received wrong, I feel it: My
cau&s;e is good, I know it; and what&s;over happens,
all the powers on earth can never exert more

The whole letter is &s;o curious and &s;o &s;pirited, that the reader may not be di&s;plea&s;ed to read it. &startq;My very good lord; Tho' there is not that man this day living, whom I would &s;ooner make judge of any que&s;tion that might concern me than your&s;elf, yet you mu&s;t give me leave to tell you that in &s;ome ca&s;es I mu&s;t appeal from all earthly judges: And if in any then &s;urely in this, when the highe&s;t judge on earth had impo&s;ed on me the heavie&s;t puni&s;hment without trial or hearing. Since then I mu&s;t either an&s;wer your lord&s;hip's argument, or el&s;e for&s;ake mine own ju&s;t defence, I will force mine aching head to do me &s;ervice for an hour. I mu&s;t fir&s;t deny my di&s;content, which was forced, to be an humourous di&s;content; and that it was un&s;ea&s;onable or is of &s;o long continuing, your lord&s;hip &s;hould rather condole with me than expo&s;tulate: Natural &s;ea&s;ons are expected here below; but violent and unrea&s;onable &s;torms come from above: There is no tempe&s;t equal to the pa&s;&s;ionate indig|nation of a prince; nor yet at any time &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable as when it lighten on tho&s;e that might expect a harve&s;t of their careful and pain|ful labours. He that is once wounded, mu&s;t needs feel &s;mart, till his hurt is cured, or the part hurt become &s;en&s;ele&s;s: But cure I expect none, her maje&s;ty's heart being obdurate again&s;t me; and be without &s;en&s;e I cannot, being of fle&s;h and blood. But, &s;ay you, I may aim at the end: I do more than aim; for I &s;ee an end of all my fortunes, I have &s;et an end to all my de&s;ires. In this cour&s;e do I any thing for my enemies? When I was at court, I found them ab&s;olute; and, therefore, I had rather they &s;hould triumph alone, than have me attendant upon their chariots. Or do I leave my friends? When I was a courtier, I could yield them no fruit of my love unto them; and now, that I am a hermit, they &s;hall bear no envy for their love towards me. Or do I for&s;ake my&s;elf, becau&s;e I do enjoy my&s;elf? Or do I overthrow my fortunes, becau&s;e I build not a fortune of paper walls, which every puff of wind bloweth down? Or do I ruinate mine honour, becau&s;e I leave following the pur&s;uit, or wearing the fal&s;e badge or mark of the &s;hadow of honour? Do I give courage or comfort to the foreign foe, becau&s;e I re&s;erve my&s;elf to encounter with him? Or becau&s;e I keep my heart from bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' I cannot keep my fortune from declining? No, no, my good lord, I give every one of the&s;e con&s;iderations its due weight; and the more I weigh them, the more I find my&s;elf ju&s;tified from offending in any of them. As for the two la&s;t objections, that I for&s;ake my country, when it hath mo&s;t need of me, and fail in that indi&s;&s;oluble duty which I owe to my &s;overeign; I an&s;wer, that if my country had at this time any need of my public &s;ervice, her maje&s;ty, that governeth it, would not have driven me to a private life. I am tied to my country by two bonds; one public, to di&s;charge carefully and indu&s;triou&s;ly that tru&s;t which is committed to me; the other pri|vate, to &s;acrifice for it my life and carca&s;e, which hath been nouri&s;hed in it. Of the fir&s;t I am free, being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, di&s;charged, and di&s;|abled by her maje&s;ty: Of the other, nothing can free me but death; and therefore no occa&s;ion of my performance &s;hall &s;ooner offer it&s;elf but I &s;hall meet it half way. The indi&s;&s;oluble duty which I owe unto her maje&s;ty, is only the duty of allegiance, which I never have, nor ever can fail in: The duty of attendance, is no indi&s;&s;oluble duty. I owe her maje&s;ty the duty of an earl and of lord mar&s;hal of England. I have been content to do her maje&s;ty the &s;ervice of a clerk; but I can never &s;erve her as a villain or a &s;lave. But yet you &s;ay I mu&s;t give way unto the time. So I do; for now that I &s;ee the &s;torm come, I have put my&s;elf into the harbour. <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;aieth, we mu&s;t give way to Fortune: I know that Fortune is both blind and &s;trong, and therefore I go as far as I can out of her way. You &s;ay, the remedy is not to &s;trive: I neither &s;trive nor &s;eek for remedy. But, you &s;ay, I mu&s;t yield and &s;ubmit: I can neither yield my&s;elf to be guilty, nor allow the imputation laid upon me to be ju&s;t: I owe &s;o much to the Author of all truth, as I can never yield truth to be fal&s;ehood, nor fal&s;ehood to be truth. Have I given cau&s;e, you a&s;k; and yet take a &s;candal when I have done? No: I gave no cau&s;e, not &s;o much as <HI>Fimbria</HI>'s complaint again&s;t me; for I did <HI>totum telum corpore recipere:</HI> Receive the whole &s;word into my body.

nothing indeed but his own indi&s;cretion could thence|forth

authority was never entirely ab&s;olute, or uncontrouled

of her other inclinations or affections could ever over|come
her confidence in &s;o u&s;eful a coun&s;ellor; and as
he had had the genero&s;ity or good &s;en&s;e to pay a&s;&s;i|duous
court to her, during her &s;i&s;ter's reign, when it

do certainly qualify him be&s;t for filling them.
Of al the Queen's mini&s;ters he was the only one who

Madrid. This haughty prince, de&s;irous of an accom|modation
with his revolted &s;ubjects in the Netherlands,
but di&s;daining to make in his own name the conce&s;|&s;ions
requi&s;ite for that purpo&s;e, had transferred to his
daughter, married to the archduke Albert, the property
of the Low Country provinces; but as it was not ex|pected,
that that prince&s;s could have any po&s;terity, and
as the rever&s;ion, in ca&s;e of the failure of her i&s;&s;ue, was
&s;till re&s;erved to the crown of Spain, the States con|&s;idered
this deed only as the change of a name, and
per&s;i&s;ted with equal ob&s;tinacy in their re&s;i&s;tance to the
Spani&s;h arms. The other &s;tates al&s;o of Europe made
no di&s;tinction between the courts of Bru&s;&s;els and Ma|drid;
and the &s;ecret oppo&s;ition of France, as well as
the avowed force of England, continued to operate
again&s;t the progre&s;s of Albert, as it had done again&s;t
that of Philip.</P>

<P>THO' the dominion of the Engli&s;h over Ireland
had been e&s;tabli&s;hed above four centuries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLIV.</NOTE> it may
&s;afely be affirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1599.</NOTE> that their authority had hitherto been
little more than nominal. The Iri&s;h princes and nobles,
divided among them&s;elves, readily paid the exterior
marks of obe$&s;ance to a power which they were not
able to re&s;i&s;t; but, as no durable force was ever kept
on foot to retain them to their duty, they relap&s;ed &s;till
into their former &s;tate of independance. Too weak
to introduce order and obedience among the rude in|habitants,
the Engli&s;h authority was yet &s;ufficient to
check the growth of any enterprizing genius among
the natives: And tho' it could be&s;tow no true form of
civil government, it was able to prevent the ri&s;e of any
&s;uch form, from the internal combination or policy of
the Iri&s;h<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sir J. Davis, p. 5, 6, 7, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>Most of the Engli&s;h in&s;titutions likewi&s;e, by which
that i&s;land was governed, were to the la&s;t degree ab&s;urd,
and &s;uch as no &s;tate before had ever thought of, for
the pre&s;erving dominion over its conquered provinces.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="459">
THE Engli&s;h nation, all on fire for the project of
&s;ubduing France, a project, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s was the
mo&s;t improbable, and would to them have proved the
mo&s;t pernicious; neglected all other enterprizes, to
which their &s;ituation &s;o &s;trongly invited them, and
which, in time, would have brought them an acce&s;&s;ion
of riches, grandeur, and &s;ecurity. The &s;mall army
which they maintained in Ireland, they never &s;upplied
regularly with pay; and as no money could be levied
from the i&s;land, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed none, they gave their
&s;oldiers the privilege of free quarter upon the natives.
Rapine and in&s;olence inflamed the hatred, which pre|vailed
between the conquerors and the conquered:
Want of &s;ecurity among the Iri&s;h, introducing de|&s;pair,
nouri&s;hed &s;till farther the &s;loth, &s;o natural to that
uncultivated people.</P>
<P>BUT the Engli&s;h carried farther their ill-judged ty|ranny.
In&s;tead of inviting the Iri&s;h, to adopt the more
civilized cu&s;toms of their conquerors, they even refu&s;ed,
though earne&s;tly &s;ollicited, to communicate to them
the privilege of their laws, and every where marked
them out as aliens and as enemies. Thrown out of
the protection of ju&s;tice, the natives could find no &s;e|curity
but in force; and flying the neighbourhood of
cities, which they could not approach with &s;afety,
they &s;heltered them&s;elves in their mar&s;hes and fore&s;ts
from the in&s;olence of their inhuman ma&s;ters. Being
treated like wild bea&s;ts, they became &s;uch; and join|ing
the ardor of revenge to their yet untamed bar|barity,
they grew every day more intractable and
dangerous<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sir J. Davis, p. 102, 103, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the Engli&s;h princes deemed the conque&s;t of the
di&s;per&s;ed Iri&s;h to be more the object of time and pa|tience
than the &s;ource of military glory, they willingly
delegated that office to private adventurers, who in|li&s;ting
<PB N="413" REF="460">
&s;oldiers at their own charge, conquered provinces
of that i&s;land, which they converted to their own
profit. Separate juri&s;dictions and principalities were
eftabli&s;hed by the&s;e lordly conquerors: The power of
peace and war was a&s;&s;umed: Military law was exer|ci&s;ed
over the Iri&s;h, whom they &s;ubdued, and, by de|grees,
over the Engli&s;h, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they con|quered:
And, after their dominion had once taken
root, deeming the Engli&s;h in&s;titutions le&s;s favourable
to barbarous empire, they degenerated into mere Iri&s;h,
and abandoned the garb, language, manners and laws
of their native country<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sir J. Davis, p. 133. 134. $word$.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By all this imprudent conduct of England, the na|tives
of its dependant &s;tate, remained &s;till in that ab|ject
condition, into which the northern and we&s;tern
parts of Europe were &s;unk, before they received civility
and &s;lavery from the refined policy and irre&s;i&s;tible bra|very
of Rome. Even at the end of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury,
when every chri&s;tian nation was cultivating with
ardour every civil art of life, that i&s;land, lying in a
temperate climate, enjoying a fertile &s;oil, acce&s;&s;ible in
its &s;ituation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of innumerable harbours, was
&s;till, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages, inhabited by a
people, who&s;e cu&s;toms and manners approached nearer
tho&s;e of &s;avages than of barbarians.</P>
<P>As the brutality and ignorance of the Iri&s;h was ex|treme,
they were &s;unk below the reach of that cu|rio&s;ity
and love of novelty, by which every other people
in Europe had been &s;eized at the beginning of that
century, and which had engaged them in innovations
and religious di&s;putes, with which they were &s;till &s;o vio|lently
agitated. The antient &s;uper&s;tition, the practi&s;es
and ob&s;ervances of their fathers, mingled and polluted
with many wild opinions, &s;till maintained an un&s;haken
empire over them; and the example alone of the
<PB N="414" REF="461">
Engli&s;h was &s;ufficient to render the re&s;ormation odious
to the prejudiced and di&s;contented Iri&s;h. The old op|po&s;ition
of manners, laws, and intere&s;t, was now in|flamed
by religious antipathy; and the &s;ubduing and
civilizing that country &s;eemed to become every day
more difficult and more impracticable.</P>
<P>THE animo&s;ity again&s;t the Engli&s;h was carried &s;o
far by the Iri&s;h, that, in an in&s;urrection, rai&s;ed by two
&s;ons of the earl of Clanricard, they put to the &s;word
all the inhabitants of the town of Athenry, tho' Iri&s;h;
becau&s;e they began to conform them&s;elves to Engli&s;h
cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions, and had embraced a more
cultivated and civilized form of life, than had been
practi&s;ed by their barbarous ance&s;tors<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 457.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE u&s;ual revenue of Ireland amounted only to &s;ix
thou&s;and pounds a year<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of the Sidneys, vol. I. p. 86.</NOTE>: The Queen, though with
much repining<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 342. Sydney, vol. I. p. 85, 200.</NOTE>, commonly added twenty thou&s;and
more, which &s;he remitted from England: And with
this &s;mall revenue, a body of one thou&s;and men was
&s;upported, which, in extraordinary emergencies was
angmented to two thou&s;and<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 542. Sydney, vol I. p. 65, 109, 133, 184.</NOTE>. No wonder that a
force, &s;o di&s;proportioned to the occa&s;ion, in&s;tead of
&s;ubduing a mutinous kingdom, &s;erved rather to pro|voke
the natives, and to excite tho&s;e frequent in&s;ur|rections
and rebellions, which &s;till farther inflamed the
animo&s;ity between the two nations, and encrea&s;ed the
barbarity and di&s;orders, to which the Iri&s;h were natu|rally
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>IN 1560, Shan O'Neale, or the great O'Neale, as
the Iri&s;h called him, becau&s;e head of that potent clan,
rai&s;ed a rebellion in Ul&s;ter; and after &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes,
was received into favour, upon his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and his
promi&s;e of a more dutiful behaviour for the future<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 385, 391.</NOTE>.
<PB N="415" REF="462">
This impunity tempted him to undertake a new in&s;ur|rection
in 1567; but being pu&s;hed by Sir Henry Sidney,
lord deputy, he retreated into Clandeboy, and rather
than &s;ubmit to the Engli&s;h, he put him&s;elf into the
hands of &s;ome Scots i&s;landers, who commonly infe&s;ted
tho&s;e parts by their incur&s;ions. The Scots, who re|tained
a quarrel again&s;t him on account of former in|juries,
violated the laws of ho&s;pitality, and murdered
him in a fe&s;tival, to which they had invited him. He
was a man equally noted for his pride, his violences,
his debaucheries, and his hatred of the Engli&s;h nation.
He is &s;aid to have put &s;ome of his followers to death,
becau&s;e they endeavoured to introduce the u&s;e of bread
after the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 409.</NOTE>. Tho' &s;o violent an enemy
to luxury, he was extremely addicted to riot; and was
accu&s;tomed, after his intemperance had thrown him
into a fever, to plunge his body into mire, that he
might allay the flame, which he had rai&s;ed by former
exce&s;&s;es<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 409. Cox, p. 324.</NOTE>. Such was the life led by this haughty
barabarian, who &s;corned the title of earl of Tyrone,
which Elizabeth intended to have re&s;tored to him, and
who a&s;&s;umed the rank and appellation of King of
Ul&s;ter. He u&s;ed al&s;o to &s;ay, that tho' the Queen was

during which time, he &s;truggled with many difficulties,

from the only family, e&s;tabli&s;hed in Ireland, that had
ever &s;teddily maintained its loyalty to the Engli&s;h
crown<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 424.</NOTE>. The earl of Thomond, in 1570, attempted
a rebellion in Connaught, but was obliged to fly into
France, before his de&s;igns were ripe for execution.
Stukeley, another fugitive, found &s;uch credit with the
pope, Gregory the 13th, that he flattered his holine&s;s
with the pro&s;pect of making his nephew, Buon Com|pagno,
King of Ireland; and as if this project had al|ready
taken effect, he accepted the title of marqui&s;s of
Lein&s;ter from the new &s;overeign<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 430. Cox, p. 354.</NOTE>. He pa&s;&s;ed next
into Spain; and after having received much encourage|ment
and great rewards from Philip, who intended to
make u&s;e of him as an in&s;trument to di&s;turb Queen
Elizabeth, he was found to po&s;&s;e&s;s too little intere&s;t for
executing tho&s;e high promi&s;es, which he had made to
that monarch. He retired into Portugal; and follow|ing
the fortunes of Don Seba&s;tian, he peri&s;hed with
that gallant prince in his bold but fatal expedition a|gain&s;t
the Moors.</P>
<P>LORD Gray &s;ucceeded Sydney in the government of
Ireland; and, in 1579, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a new rebellion of
the earl of De&s;mond, though &s;upported by a body of
Spaniards and Italians. The rebellion of the Bourks
followed a few years after; occa&s;ioned by the &s;trict and
equitable admini&s;tration of Sir Richard Bingham, go|vernor
of Connaught, who endeavoured to repre&s;s the
tyranny of the chieftains over their va&s;&s;als<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 720.</NOTE>. The
Queen, finding Ireland &s;o burthen&s;ome to her, tried
&s;everal expedients for reducing it to a &s;tate of greater
order and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. She encouraged the earl of E&s;&s;ex,
father to that nobleman, who was afterwards her fa|vourite,
to attempt the &s;ubduing and planting Clande|boy,
Ferny, and other territories, part of &s;ome late
<PB N="417" REF="468">
forfeitures: But that enterprize proved unfortunate;
and E&s;&s;ex died of a di&s;temper, occa&s;ioned, as is &s;uppo&s;ed,
by the vexation, which he had conceived, from his
di&s;appointments. An univer&s;ity was founded in Dublin
with a view of introducing arts and learning into that
kingdom, and civilizing the uncultivated manners of
the inhabitants<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 566.</NOTE>. But the mo&s;t unhappy expedient,
employed in the government of Ireland, was that made
u&s;e of in 1585 by Sir John Perrot, at that time lord
deputy: He put arms into the hands of the Iri&s;h inha|bitants
of Ul&s;ter, in order to enable them, without
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the government, to repre&s;s the incur|&s;ions
of the Scots i&s;landers, by which the&s;e parts were
much infe&s;ted<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Naneon's Fragmenta Regalia, p. 203.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time, the invitations of
Philip, joined to their zeal for the catholic religion,
engaged many of the gentry to &s;erve in the Low
Country wars; and thus Ireland, being provided both
of officers and &s;oldiers, of di&s;cipline and arms, became
formidable to the Engli&s;h, and was thenceforth able
to maintain a more regular war again&s;t her antient
ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>HUGH O'Neale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrone's rebellio$.</NOTE> nephew to Shan O'Neale, had been
rai&s;ed by the Queen to the dignity of earl of Tyrone;
but having murdered his cou&s;in, &s;on to that rebel, and
being acknowleged head of his clan, he preferred the
pride of barbarous licence and dominion, to the plea|fures
of opulence and tranquillity, and fomented all
tho&s;e di&s;orders, by which he hoped to weaken or over|turn
the Engli&s;h government. He was noted for the
vices of perfidy and cruelty, &s;o common among uncul|tivated
nations; and was al&s;o eminent for courage,
a virtue, which their di&s;orderly cour&s;e of life requires,
and which, notwith&s;tanding, being un&s;upported by
the principle of honour, is commonly more precarious
among them, than among a civilized people. Tyrone,
actuated by this &s;pirit, fecretly formented the di&s;contents
of the Maguires, Odonnels, O'Rourks, Macmahons,
<PB N="418" REF="469">
and other rebels; yet tru&s;ting to the influence of his
deceitful oaths and profe&s;&s;ions, he put him&s;elf into the
hands of Sir William Ru&s;&s;el, who, in the year 1594,
was &s;ent over lord deputy into Ireland. Contrary to
the advice and prote&s;tation of Sir Henry Bagnal, mar|&s;hal
of the army, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and returning to
his own country, he embraced the re&s;olution of rai&s;ing
an open rebellion, and of relying no longer on the
lenity or inexperience of the Engli&s;h government. He
entered into a corre&s;pondence with Spain: He procured
thence a &s;upply of arms and ammunition: And having
united all the Iri&s;h chieftains in a dependance upon
him&s;elf, he began to be regarded as a formidable
enemy.</P>
<P>THE native Iri&s;h were &s;o mi&s;erably poor, that their
country afforded few other commodities but cattle and
oatmeal, which were ea&s;ily de&s;troyed or driven away on
the approach of the enemy; and as Elizabeth was
aver&s;e to the expence requi&s;ite for &s;upporting her armies,
the Engli&s;h found much difficulty in pu&s;hing their ad|vantages,
and in pur&s;uing the rebels into the bogs,
woods, and other fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, to which they retreated.
The&s;e motives made Sir John Norris, who commanded
the Engli&s;h army, the more ready to hearken to any
propo&s;als of truce or accommodation made him by
Tyrone; and after the war was &s;pun out by the&s;e arti|fices
for &s;ome years, that gallant Engli&s;hman, finding
that he had been deceived by treacherous promi&s;es, and
that he had performed nothing worthy of his antient
reputation, was &s;eized with a langui&s;hing di&s;temper,
and died of vexation and di&s;content. Sir Henry
Bagnal, who &s;ucceeded him in the command, was
&s;till more unfortunate. As he advanced to relieve the
fort of Black-water, be&s;ieged by the rebels, he was
&s;urrounded in di&s;advantageous ground; his &s;oldiers,
di&s;couraged by part of their powder's accidentally
taking fire, were put to flight; and, tho' the pur&s;uit
was &s;topt by Montacute, who commanded the Engli&s;h
hor&s;e, fifteen hundred men, together with the general
<PB N="419" REF="470">
him&s;elf, were left dead upon the &s;pot. This victory,
&s;o unu&s;ual to the Iri&s;h, mightly rai&s;ed their &s;pirits,
&s;upplied them with arms and ammunition, and exalted
the reputation of Tyrone, who a&s;&s;umed the character
of the deliverer of his country, and patron of Iri&s;h
liberty<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 415.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h council were now &s;en&s;ible that the
rebellion of Ireland was come to a dangerous head,
and that the former temporizing arts, of granting
truces and pacifications to the rebels, and of allowing
them to purcha&s;e pardons by re&s;igning part of the
plunder, acquired during their in&s;urrections, &s;erved
only to encourage the &s;pirit of mutiny and di&s;order
among them. It was therefore re&s;olved to pu&s;h the
war by more vigorous mea&s;ures; and the Queen ca&s;t
her eye on Charles Blount, lord Mountjoy, as a man,
who, tho' hitherto le&s;s accu&s;tomed to arms than to
books and literature, was endowed, &s;he thought, with
talents equal to that undertaking. But the young earl
of E&s;&s;ex, ambitious of glory, and de&s;irous of obtaining
this government for him&s;elf, oppo&s;ed the choice of
Mountjoy; and repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of appointing,
for that important employment, &s;ome per&s;on more ex|perienced
in war than this nobleman, more practi&s;ed
in bu&s;ine&s;s, and of higher quality and reputation. By
this de&s;cription, he was under&s;tood to mean him&s;elf<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 512.</NOTE>;
and no &s;ooner was his de&s;ire known, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
that government, than his enemies, even more zea|lou&s;ly
than his friends, con&s;pired to render his wi&s;hes
effectual. Many of his friends thought, that he never
ought to con&s;ent, except for a very &s;hort time, to
accept of employments which mu&s;t remove him from
court, and prevent him from cultivating that per|&s;onal
inclination, which the Queen &s;o vi&s;ibly bore
him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p: 79.</NOTE>. His enemies hoped, that if, by his ab&s;ence,
&s;he had once leizure to forget the charms of his per&s;on
<PB N="420" REF="471">
and conver&s;ation, his impatient and lofty demeanor
would &s;oon di&s;gu&s;t a prince&s;s, who u&s;ually exacted
&s;uch profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and implicit obedience from
all her &s;ervants. But E&s;&s;ex was incapable of entering
into &s;uch cautious views; and even Elizabeth, who
was extremely de&s;irous of &s;ubduing the Iri&s;h rebels,
and who was much prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of E&s;&s;ex's
genius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;&s;ex &s;ent over to Ireand.</NOTE> readily agreed to appoint him governor of Ire|land,
under the title of lord lieutenant. The more to
encourage him in his undertaking, &s;he granted him by
his patent more exten&s;ive authority than had ever before
been con&s;erred on any lieutenant; the power of car|rying
on or fini&s;hing the war as he plea&s;ed, of par|doning
the rebels, and of filling all the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able
employments of the kingdom<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 366.</NOTE>. And to en&s;ure
him of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he levied a numerous army of &s;ixteen
thou&s;and foot and thirteen hundred hor&s;e, which &s;he
afterwards augmented to twenty thou&s;and foot and
two thou&s;and hor&s;e: A force, which, it was appre|hended,
would be able, in one campaign, to overwhelm
the rebels, and make an entire conque&s;t of Ireland.
Nor did E&s;&s;ex's enemies, the earl of Nottingham, lord
admiral, Sir Robert Cecil, &s;ecretary, Sir Walter Ra|leigh,
and lord Cobham, throw any ob&s;tacles in the
way of the&s;e preparations; but hoped, that the higher
the Queen's expectations were rai&s;ed of &s;ucce&s;s, the
more difficult it would be for the event to corre&s;|pond
to them. In a like view, they rather &s;econded,
than oppo&s;ed, tho&s;e exalted encomiums, which E&s;&s;ex's
numerous and &s;anguine friends di&s;per&s;ed, of his high
genius, of his elegant endowments, his heroic courage,
his unbounded genero&s;ity, and his noble birth; nor
were they di&s;plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve that pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s,
which the people every where expre&s;&s;ed for this noble|man.
The&s;e artful politicians had &s;tudied his character;

<P>ESSEX
left London in the month of March, at|tended
by the acclamations of the populace, and what
did him more honour, accompanied by a numerous
train of nobility and gentry, who, from affection to
his per&s;on, had attached them&s;elves to all his fortunes,
and propo&s;ed to acquire fame and military experience
under &s;o renowned a commander. The fir&s;t act of
authority, which he exerci&s;ed, after his arrival in Ire|land,
was an indi&s;cretion, but of the generous kind;
and in both the&s;e re&s;pects, &s;uitable to his character.
He appointed his intimate friend, the earl of South|ampton,
general of the hor&s;e; a nobleman, who had
di&s;plea&s;ed the Queen by &s;ecretly marrying without her
con&s;ent, and whom &s;he had therefore enjoined E&s;&s;ex
not to employ in any command under him. She no
&s;ooner heard of this in&s;tance of di&s;obedience than &s;he
reprimanded him, and ordered him to recal his com|mi&s;&s;ion
to Southampton. But E&s;&s;ex, who had ima|gined,
that &s;ome rea&s;ons, which he oppo&s;ed to her fir&s;t

to remon&s;trate again&s;t the&s;e &s;econd orders<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 421, 451.</NOTE>; and it

ESSEX, on his landing at Dublin, had deliberated
with the Iri&s;h council, concerning the proper methods
of carrying on war again&s;t the rebels; and here he
was guilty of a capital error, which was the ruin of
his enterprize. He had always, while in England,
blamed the conduct of former commanders, who art|fully
protracted the war, who harra&s;&s;ed their troops in
&s;mall enterprizes, and who, by agreeing to truces
and temporary pacifications with the rebels, had given
them leizure to recruit their broken forces<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 431. Bacon vol. IV. p. 512.</NOTE>. In con|formity
to the&s;e views, he had ever in&s;i&s;ted upon lead|ing
his forces immediately into Ul&s;ter again&s;t Tyrone,
the capital enemy; and his in&s;tructions had been
drawn agreeably to the&s;e his declared intentions and
re&s;olutions. But the Iri&s;h coun&s;ellors per&s;uaded him,
that the &s;ea&s;on was too early for the enterpize, and
that as the mora&s;&s;es, in which the Iri&s;h u&s;ually &s;heltered
them&s;elves, would not, as yet, be pa&s;&s;abel to the Engli&s;h
forces, it would be better to employ the pre&s;ent time
in an expedition into Mun&s;ter. Their &s;ecret rea&s;on for
this advice was, that many of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed e&s;tates
in that province, and were de&s;irous to have the enemy
di&s;lodged from their neighbourhood<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 448.</NOTE>: But the &s;ame
&s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, which had induced them to give this
council, made them &s;oon after di&s;own it, when they
found the bad con&s;equences with which it was at|tended<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 140.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ESSEX obliged all the rebels of Mun&s;ter either to
&s;ubmit or to fly into the neighbouring provinces: But
as the Iri&s;h, from the greatne&s;s of the Queen's pre|parations,
had concluded, that &s;he intended to reduce
them to total &s;ubjection, or even utterly to exterminate
them, they con&s;idered their pre&s;ent defence as a com|mon
cau&s;e; and the Engli&s;h forces were no &s;ooner
withdrawn, than the inhabitants of Mun&s;ter relap&s;ed
into rebellion, and renewed their confederacy with
<PB N="423" REF="474">
their other countrymen. The army, meanwhile, by
the fatigue of long and tedious marches, and by the
influence of the climate, was become extreme &s;ickly;
and on their return to Dublin, about the middle of
July, were &s;uprizingly dimini&s;hed in number. Their
courage was even much abated: For tho' they had
prevailed in &s;ome le&s;&s;er enterprizes, as again&s;t the lord
Cahir and others; yet had they &s;ometimes met with
more &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance than they expected from the Iri&s;h,
whom they were wont to de&s;pi&s;e; and as they were
raw troops and unexperienced, a con&s;iderable body of
them had been put to flight at the Glins, by an inferior
number of the enemy. E&s;&s;ex was &s;o enraged at this
mi&s;behaviour, that he ca&s;hiered all the officers, and
decimated the private man<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cox, p. 421.</NOTE>. But this in&s;tance of &s;e|verity,
tho' nece&s;&s;ary, had intimidated the &s;oldiers, and
had encrea&s;ed their aver&s;ion to the pre&s;ent &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE Queen was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted, when &s;he
heard, that &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the &s;ea&s;on was
con&s;umed in the&s;e frivolous enterprizes; and was &s;till
more &s;urprized, that E&s;&s;ex per&s;evered in the &s;ame
practice, which he had &s;o much condemned in others.
and which he knew to be &s;o much contrary to her
purpo&s;e and intention. That nobleman, in order to
give his troops leizure to recruit from their &s;ickne&s;s
and fatigue, marched with a &s;mall body of fifteen
hundred men into the county of Ophelie again&s;t the
O'Connors and O'Mores, whom he forced to a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion:
But, on his return to Dublin, he found the
army &s;o extremely dimini&s;hed, that he wrote to the
Engli&s;h council an account of his condition, and
informed them, that, if he received not immediately a
reinforcement of two thou&s;and men, it would be im|po&s;&s;ible
for him this &s;ea&s;on to attempt any thing
again&s;t Tyrone. That there might be no pretence
for farther inactivity, the Queen immediately &s;ent over

the number demanded<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 430. Cox, p. 421.</NOTE>; and E&s;&s;ex began at la&s;t to
a&s;&s;emble his forces for the expedition into Ul&s;ter. The
army was &s;o extremely aver&s;e to this enterprize, and
terri&s;ied with the reputation of Tyrone, that many
of them counterfeited &s;ickne&s;s, many of them de|&s;erted<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 112, 113.</NOTE>; and E&s;&s;ex found, that after leaving the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
garri&s;ons, he could &s;carce lead four thou|&s;and
men again&s;t the rebels. He marched, however,
with this &s;mall army; but was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible, that,
in &s;o advanced a &s;ea&s;on, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him
to effectuate any thing again&s;t an enemy, who, tho'
&s;uperior in number, were determined to avoid every
deci&s;ive action. He hearkened, therefore, to a me&s;|&s;age
&s;ent him by Tyrone, who de&s;ired a conference;
and a place, near the two camps, was accordingly ap|pointed.
The generals met without any of their at|tendants,
and a river ran between them, into which
Tyrone entered to the depth of his &s;adlde: But E&s;&s;ex
&s;tood on the oppo&s;ite bank. After half an hour's con|ference,
where Tyrone behaved with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
and re&s;pect to the lord lieutenant, a ce&s;&s;ation of arms
was concluded to the fir&s;t of May, renewable from
&s;ix weeks to &s;ix weeks; but which might be broke off
by either party upon a fornight's warning<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 125.</NOTE>. E&s;&s;ex
al&s;o received from Tyrone propo&s;als for a peace, in
which that rebel had in&s;erted many unrea&s;onable and
exorbitant conditions: And there appeared afterwards
&s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that he had here commenced
a very unju&s;tifiable corre&s;pondence with the enemy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 307. State Trials. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 514, 535. 537.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So unexpected an i&s;&s;ue of an enterprize, the greate&s;t
and mo&s;t expen&s;ive which Elizabeth had ever under|taken,
provoked her extremely again&s;t E&s;&s;ex; and this
di&s;gu&s;t was much augmented by other circum&s;tances
of that nobleman's conduct. He wrote many letters
to the Queen and council, full of peevi&s;h and impa|tient
<PB N="425" REF="476">
expre&s;&s;ions; complaining of his enemies, la|menting
that their calumnies &s;hould be believed again&s;t
him, and di&s;covering &s;ymptoms of a mind, equally
haughty and di&s;contented. She took care to inform
him of her di&s;&s;atisfaction; but commanded him to
remain in Ireland till farther orders.</P>
<P>ESSEX heard at once of Elizabeth's anger, and of
the promotion of his enemies, Sir Robert Cecil, to
the office of ma&s;ter of the wards, an office which he
him&s;elf a&s;pired to: And dreading, that, if he remained
any longer ab&s;ent, the Queen would be totally ali|enated
from him, he ha&s;tily embraced a re&s;olution,
which, he knew, had once &s;ucceeded with the earl of Leice&s;ter, the former favourite of Elizabeth. Leice&s;ter
being informed, while in the Low Countries, that his
mi&s;tre&s;s was extremely di&s;plea&s;ed with his conduct,
di&s;obeyed her orders by coming over into England;
and having pacified her by his pre&s;ence, by his apo|logies,
and by his flattery and in&s;inuation, di&s;appointed
all the expectations of his enemies<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 453.</NOTE>. E&s;&s;ex, therefore,
weighing more the &s;imilarity of circum&s;tances than
the difference of characters between him&s;elf and
Leice&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to England.</NOTE> immediately &s;et out for England; and mak|ing
&s;peedy journeys, he arrived at court before any
one was in the lea&s;t apprized of his intentions<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 118.</NOTE>.
Tho' be&s;meared with dirt and &s;weat, he ha&s;tened up
&s;tairs to the pre&s;ence chamber, thence to the privy-chamber;
nor &s;topped till he was in the Queen's
bed chamber, who was newly ri&s;en, and was &s;itting
with her hair about her face. He threw him&s;elf on
his knees, ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and had &s;ome private con|ference
with her; where he was &s;o graciou&s;ly received,
that, on his departure, he was heard to expre&s;s great
&s;atisfaction, and to thank God, that, tho' he had &s;uffered
much trouble and many &s;torms abroad, he found a &s;weet
calm at home<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 127.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="477">
BUT this placability of Elizabeth was merely the
re&s;ult of her &s;urprize, and of the momentary &s;atisfac|tion
which &s;he felt on the &s;udden and unexpected ap|pearance
of her favourite: After &s;he had leizure for
recollection, all his faults recurred to her memory;
and &s;he thought it nece&s;&s;ary by &s;ome &s;evere di&s;cipline,
to &s;ubdue his haughty and imperious &s;pirit, who, pre|&s;uming
on her partiality and indulgence, had pretended
to domineer in her councils, to engro&s;s all her favour,
and to act, in the mo&s;t important affairs, without re|gard
to her orders and in&s;tructions. When E&s;&s;ex
waited on her in the afternoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is di&s;graced.</NOTE> he found her extremely
altered in her carriage towards him: She ordered him
to be confined to his chamber; to be twice examined
by the council; and tho' his an&s;wers were calm and
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, &s;he committed him to the cu&s;tody of the
lord keeper, Egerton, and held him &s;eque&s;tered from
all company, even from that of his counte&s;s, nor was &s;o
much as the intercour&s;e of letters permitted between
them. E&s;&s;ex dropped many expre&s;&s;ions of humiliation
and &s;orrow, none of re&s;entment: He profe&s;&s;ed an entire
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Queen's will: Declared his intention
of retiring into the country, and of leading thenceforth
a private life, remote from courts and bu&s;ine&s;s: But
tho' he affected to be &s;o entirely cured of his a&s;piring
ambition, the vexation of this di&s;appointment, and of
the triumph gained by his enemies, preyed upon his
haughty &s;pirit; and he fell into a di&s;temper, which
&s;eemed to put his life in hazard.</P>
<P>THE Queen had always declared to all the world,
and even to the earl him&s;elf, that the purpo&s;e of her
&s;everity was to correct, not to ruin him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, p. 444, 445. Sydney Papers, vol. II. p. 196.</NOTE>; and when
&s;he heard of his condition, &s;he was not a little alarmed
with the danger. She ordered eitht phy&s;icians of the
be&s;t reputation and experience to con&s;ult of his cafe;
<PB N="427" REF="478">
and being informed, that the i&s;&s;ue was much to be ap|prehended,
&s;he &s;ent Dr. James to him with &s;ome broth,
and de&s;ired that phy&s;ician to deliver him a me&s;&s;age,
which &s;he probably deemed of &s;till greater virtue;
that, if &s;he thought &s;uch a &s;tep con&s;i&s;tent with her
honour, &s;he would her&s;elf pay him a vi&s;it. They by|&s;tanders,
who carefully ob&s;erved her countenance,
remarked, that in pronouncing the&s;e words, her eyes
were &s;u&s;&s;u&s;ed with tears<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Sydney Letters, vol. II. p. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the&s;e &s;ymptoms of the Queen's returning
affection towards E&s;&s;ex were known, they gave a &s;en|&s;ible
alarm to the faction which had declared their
oppo&s;ition to him. Sir Walter Raleigh, in particular,
the mo&s;t violent as well as the mo&s;t ambitious of his
enemies, was &s;o affected with the appearance of that
&s;udden revolution, that he was &s;eized with &s;ickne&s;s in
his turn, and the Queen was obliged to apply the &s;ame
&s;alve to his wound, and to &s;end him a favourable me&s;|&s;age,
expre&s;&s;ing her de&s;ire of his recovery<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 139.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE medicine which the Queen admini&s;tered to
the&s;e a&s;piring rivals, was &s;ucce&s;sful with both; and
E&s;&s;ex, being now allowed the company of his counte&s;s,
and having entertained more promi&s;ing hopes of his
future for tunes, was &s;o much re&s;tored in his health,
as to be thought pa&s;t all danger. A belief was infu&s;ed
into Elizabeth, that his di&s;temper had been entirely
counter&s;eit, in order to move her compa&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 153.</NOTE>; and
&s;he relap&s;ed into her former rigour again&s;t him. He
wrote her a letter, and &s;ent her a rich pre&s;ent on New-Year's
day; as was u&s;ual among the courtiers of that
time: She read the letter, but rejected the pre&s;ent<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 155, 156.</NOTE>.
After &s;ome interval, however, of &s;everity, &s;he allowed
him to retire to his own hou&s;e: And tho' he remained
&s;till under cu&s;tody, and was &s;eque&s;tered from all com|pany,
<PB N="428" REF="479">
he was &s;o grateful for this mark of lenity, that
he &s;ent her a letter of thanks on the occa&s;ion. &startq;This

of E&s;&s;ex, daughter of Sir Francis Wal&s;ingham,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as well as her hu&s;band, a very refined ta&s;te
in literature; and the chief con&s;olation which E&s;&s;ex
enjoyed, during this period of anxiety and expectation,
con&s;i&s;ted in her company, and in reading with her tho&s;e
in&s;tructive and entertaining authors which, even during
the time of his greate&s;t pro&s;perity, he had never entirely
neglected.</P>
<P>THERE were &s;everal incidents which kept alive
the Queen's anger again&s;t E&s;&s;ex. Every account which
&s;he received from Ireland, convinced her more and
more of his mi&s;conduct in that government, and of the
in&s;ignificant purpo&s;es to which he had employed &s;o
much force and trea&s;ure, Tyrone, &s;o far from being
quelled, had thought proper, in le&s;s than three months,
to break the truce, and joining with O Donel, and
other rebels, had over-run almo&s;t the whole kingdom.
He boa&s;ted, that he was certain of receiving a &s;upply of
men, money, and arms from Spain: He pretended to
be champion of the catholic religion: And he loudly
exulted in the pre&s;ent of a phoenix plume, which
the pope, Clement the eighth, in order to encourage
him in the pro&s;ecution of &s;o good a cau&s;e, had con|&s;ecrated,
and had conferred upon him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 617.</NOTE>. The Queen,
that &s;he might check his progre&s;s, returned to her for|mer
intention, of appointing Mountjoy lord-deputy;
and tho' that nobleman, who was an intimate friend
<PB N="429" REF="480">
of E&s;&s;ex, and de&s;ired his return to the government of
Ireland, did at fir&s;t very earne&s;tly excu&s;e him&s;elf, on
account of his bad &s;tate of health, &s;he obliged him
to accept of that employment. Mountjoy found the
i&s;land almo&s;t in a de&s;perate &s;ituation; but being a
man of capacity and vigour, he was &s;o little di&s;couraged,
that he immediately advanced again&s;t Tyrone in Ul&s;ter.
He peetrated into the heart of that country, the chief
&s;eat of the rebels: He fortified Derry and Mount-Norris,
in order to bridle the Iri&s;h: He chaced them
from the field, and obliged them to take &s;helter in the
woods and mora&s;&s;es: He employed, with equal &s;uc|ce&s;s,
Sir Gorge Carew in Mun&s;ter: And by the&s;e pro|mi&s;ing
&s;ucce&s;&s;es, he gave new life to the Queen's autho|rity
in that country.</P>
<P>As the compari&s;on of Mountjoy's admini&s;tration
with that of E&s;&s;ex, contributed to alienate Elizabeth
from her favourite, &s;he received additional di&s;gu&s;t from
the partiality of the people, who, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an
extravagant idea of E&s;&s;ex's merit, complained of the
inju&s;tice which was done him, by his removal from
court, and by his confinement. Libels were &s;ecretly
di&s;per&s;ed again&s;t Cecil and Raleigh, and all his ene|mies.
And his popularity, which was always great,
&s;eemed rather to be increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed by his
misfortunes. Elizabeth, in order to ju&s;tify to the
public her conduct with regard to him, had often
expre&s;&s;ed her intentions of having him tried in the &s;tar-chamber,
for his offences: But her tenderne&s;s for him
prevailed at la&s;t over her &s;everity; and &s;he was con|tented
to have him only examined by the privy-council.
The attorney-general, Coke, opened the
cau&s;e again&s;t him, and treated him with the cruelty
and in&s;olence which that great lawyer u&s;ually exerci&s;ed
again&s;t the unfortunate. He di&s;played, in the &s;tronge&s;t
colours, all the faults committed by E&s;&s;ex in his ad|mini&s;tration
of Ireland: His making Southampton ge|neral
<PB N="430" REF="481">
of the hor&s;e, contrary to the Queen's injunctions$
his de&s;erting the enterprize again&s;t Tyrone, and march|ing
to Lein&s;ter and Mun&s;ter; his conferring knight|hood
on too many per&s;ons; his &s;ecret conference
with Tyrone; and his &s;udden return from Ireland,
in contempt of her maje&s;ty's commands. He al&s;o
exaggerated the indignity of the conditions which
Tyrone had been allowed to propo&s;e; odious and abo|minable
conditions, &s;aid he; a public toleration of an
idolatrous religion, pardon for him&s;elf and every traitor
in Ireland, and full re&s;titution of lands and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
to all of them<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 449.</NOTE>. The &s;ollicitor-general, Fleming,
in&s;i&s;ted upon the wretched &s;ituation in which the earl
had left that kingdom; and Francis Bacon, &s;on to
Sir Nicholas Bacon, who had been lord keeper in the
beginning of the pre&s;ent reign, clo&s;ed the charge with
di&s;playing the undutiful expre&s;&s;ions contained in &s;ome
letters wrote by the earl.</P>
<P>ESSEX, when his turn came to plead in his own
behalf, renounced, with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and humility,
all preten&s;ions to an apology<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 200.</NOTE>; and declared his re&s;o|lution
never, on this or any other occa&s;ion, to have
any conte&s;t with his &s;overeign. He &s;aid, that having
&s;evered him&s;elf from the world, and abjured all &s;enti|ments
of ambition, he had no &s;cruple to confe&s;s every
failing or error into which his youth, folly, or mani|fold
infirmities might have betrayed him; that his
inward &s;orrow for his offences again&s;t her maje&s;ty
was &s;o profound, that it exceeded all his outward cro&s;&s;es
and afflictions, nor did he retain any &s;cruple of &s;ubmit|ting
to a public confe&s;&s;ion of whatever &s;he had been
plea&s;ed to impute to him; that in his acknowledge|ments
he retained only one re&s;erve, which he never
would relinqui&s;h but with his life, the a&s;&s;ertion of a
loyal and unpolluted heart, of an unfeigned affection,
<PB N="431" REF="482">
of an earne&s;t de&s;ire ever to perform to her maje&s;ty the
be&s;t &s;ervice which his poor abilities would permit; and
that if this &s;entiment was recognized by the council,
he willingly acquie&s;ced in any condemnation or &s;en|tence
which they could pronounce again&s;t him. This
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was uttered with &s;o much eloquence, and
in &s;o pathetic a manner, that it drew tears from many
of the &s;pectators<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sydney's Letters, vol. II. p. 200, 201.</NOTE>. All the privy-coun&s;ellors, in
giving their judgment, made no &s;cruple of doing the
earl ju&s;tice, with regard to the loyalty of his intentions.
Even Cecil, whom he believed his capital enemy,
treated him with regard and humanity. And the
&s;entence given by the lord keeper, (to which the council
a&s;&s;ented) was in the&s;e words. &startq;If this cau&s;e,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;had been heard in the Star-chamber, my &s;en|tence
mu&s;t have been for as great a fine as ever
was &s;et upon any man's head in that court, together
with perpetual confinement in that pri&s;on which
belongeth to a man of his quality, the Tower.
But &s;ince we are now in another place, and in a
cour&s;e of favour, my cen&s;ure is, that the earl of
E&s;&s;ex is not to execute the office of a coun&s;ellor, nor
that of earl mar&s;hal of England, nor of ma&s;ter of
the ordnance; and to return to his own hou&s;e, there
to contiue a pri&s;oner, till it &s;hall plea&s;e her maje&s;ty to
relea&s;e this and all the re&s;t of his &s;entence<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 454. Camden, p. 626, 627.</NOTE>.&endq; The
earl of Cumberland made a slight oppo&s;ition to
this &s;entence; and &s;aid, that, if he thought it would
&s;tand, he would have required a little longer time to
deliberate; that he thought it &s;omewhat &s;evere; and
that any commander in chief might ea&s;ily incur a
like penalty. But, however, added he, in confidence
of her maje&s;ty's mercy, I agree with the re&s;t. The
earl of Worce&s;ter delivered his opinion in a couple of
<PB N="432" REF="483">
Latin ver&s;es, implying, that, where the Gods are of|fended,
even misfortunes ought to be imputed as
crimes, and that accident is no excu&s;e for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions
again&s;t the Divinity.</P>
<P>BACON, &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed afterwards by his
high offices, and &s;till more by his profound genius for
the &s;ciences, was nearly allied to the Cecil family,
being nephew to lord Burleigh, and cou&s;in-german
to the &s;ecretary: But notwith&s;tanding his extraordi|nary
talents, he had met with &s;o little protection from
his powerful relations, that he had not yet obtained
any pre&s;erment in the law, which was his profe&s;&s;ion;
But E&s;&s;ex, who could di&s;tingui&s;h merit, and who pa&s;|&s;ionately
loved it, had entered into an intimate friend|&s;hip
with Bacon; had zealou&s;ly attempted, tho' with|out
&s;ucce&s;s, to procure him the office of Queen's fol|licitor;
and in order to comfort his friend under the
di&s;appointment, had conferred on him a pre&s;ent of
land to the value of eighteen hundred pounds.<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 78.</NOTE>. The
public could ill excu&s;e Bacon's appearance before the
council, again&s;t &s;o munificent a benefactor; tho' he
acted in obedience to the Queen's orders: But &s;he was
&s;o well plea&s;ed with his behaviour, that &s;he impo&s;ed on
him a new ta&s;k, of drawing a narrative of that day's
proceedings, in order to &s;atisfy the nation of the
ju&s;tice and lenity of her conduct. Bacon, who wanted
firmne&s;s of character, more than humanity, gave to
the whole transaction the mo&s;t favourable turn for
E&s;&s;ex; and, in particular, painted out, in elaborate
expre&s;&s;ion, the dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which that nobleman
di&s;covered in the defence which he made for his con|duct.
When he read the paper to her, &s;he &s;miled at
that pa&s;&s;age, and ob&s;erved to Bacon, that old love, &s;he
&s;aw, could not ea&s;ily be forgotten. He replied, that
he hoped &s;he meant that of her&s;elf<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 83.</NOTE>.</P>

ALL the world, indeed, expected that E&s;&s;ex would

as is u&s;ual in reconcilements founded on inclination;
would acquire an additional a&s;cendant with the Queen,
and after all his di&s;graces, would again appear more a
favourite than ever. They were confirmed in this
hope, when they &s;aw, that, tho' he was &s;till prohibited
to appear at court<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 462.</NOTE>, he was continued in his office
of ma&s;ter of hor&s;e, and was re&s;tored to his liberty, and
that all his friends had acce&s;s to him. E&s;&s;ex him&s;elf
&s;eemed determined to per&s;evere in that conduct which
had hitherto been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, and which the Queen,
by all this di&s;cipline, had endeavoured to render habi|tual
to him: He wrote to her, that he ki&s;&s;ed her ma|je&s;ty's
hands, and the rod with which &s;he had corrected
him; but that he could never recover his u&s;ual chear|fulne&s;s,
till &s;he deigned to admit him to that pre&s;ence
which had ever been the chief &s;ource of his happine&s;s
and enjoyment: And that he had now re&s;olved to
make amends for his pa&s;t errors, to retire into a country
&s;olitude, and to &s;ay with Nebuchadnezzar, &startq;Let
my dwelling be with the bea&s;ts of the field; let me
eat gra&s;s as an ox, and be wet with the dew of hea|ven;
till it &s;hall plea&s;e the Queen to re&s;tore me to
my under&s;tanding.&endq; The Queen was much plea&s;ed
with the&s;e &s;entiments, and replied, that &s;he heartily
wi&s;hed his actions might corre&s;pond to his expre&s;&s;ions;
that he had tried her patience a long time, and it was
but ju&s;t &s;he &s;hould now make &s;ome experiment of his
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; that her father would never have pardoned
&s;o much ob&s;tinacy; but that, if the furnace of affliction
produced &s;uch good effects, &s;he &s;hould ever after have
the better opinion of her chemi&s;try<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 628.</NOTE>.</P>

THE earl of E&s;&s;ex po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a monopoly of &s;weet
wines; and as his patent was near expiring, he pa|tiently
expected that the Queen would renew it, and
con&s;idered this event as the critical circum&s;tance of
his life, which would determine whether he could ever
hope to be rein&s;tated in credit and authority<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Birch's memoirs, vol. II. p. 472.</NOTE>. But
Elizabeth, tho' gracious in her demeanor, was of a
temper &s;omewhat haughty and &s;evere; and being con|tinually
&s;urrounded with E&s;&s;ex's enemies, means were
found to per&s;uade her, that his lofty &s;pirit was not yet
&s;ufficiently humbled, and that he mu&s;t undergo this
farther trial, before he could again be &s;afely received
into favour. She therefore refu&s;ed his demand; and
even added, in a contemptuous &s;tile, that an ungovern|able
bea&s;t mu&s;t be &s;tinted in his provender<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 628.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS rigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His intrigues.</NOTE> pu&s;hed one &s;tep too far, proved the
final ruin of this young nobleman, and was the &s;ource
of infinite &s;orrow and vexation to the Queen her&s;elf.
E&s;&s;ex, who had with great difficulty &s;o long &s;ubdued
his proud &s;pirit, and who&s;e patience was now exhau&s;ted,
imagining that the Queen was entirely inexorable,
bur&s;t at once all re&s;traints of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and of pru|dence,
and was determined to &s;eek relief, by proceeding
to the utmo&s;t extremitie again&s;t his enemies. Even
during his greate&s;t favour $e had ever been accu&s;tomed
to carry matters with a h$$h hand again&s;t his &s;overeign;
and as this practice grat$$ed his own temper, and was
&s;ometimes &s;ucce&s;sful, h$ had imprudently imagined,
that it was the only proper method of managing her<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 79.</NOTE>:
But being now reduced to de&s;pair, he gave entire reins
to his violent di&s;po&s;ition, and threw off all appear|ance
of duty and re&s;pect. Intoxicated with the ge|neral
favour which he already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he practi&s;ed
anew every art of popularity; and endeavoured to
<PB N="435" REF="486">
increa&s;e the general good-will by a ho&s;pitable manner
of life, little &s;uited to his &s;ituation and his circum&s;tances.
His former employments had given him great connec|tions
with gentlemen of the military profe&s;&s;ion; and
he now entertained, by additional care&s;&s;es and civilities,
a friend&s;hip with all de&s;perate adventurers, who&s;e at|tachment,
he hoped, might, in his pre&s;ent views, prove
&s;erviceable to him. He &s;ecretly courted the confidence
of the catholics; but his chief tru&s;t lay in the puritans,
whom he openly care&s;&s;ed, and who&s;e manners he
&s;eemed to have entirely adopted. He engaged the
mo&s;t celebrated prea$$$$$ of that &s;ect to re&s;ort to
E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e; he had da$$$ prayers and &s;ermons in
his family; and he invited all the zealots in London
to attend$tho&s;e pious exerci&s;es. Such was the di&s;po|&s;ition
now beginning to prevail among the Engli&s;h,
that, in&s;tead of fea&s;ting and public &s;pectacles, the me|thods
anciently practi&s;ed in commonwealths to gain
the populace, nothing &s;o effectually ingratiated an am|bitious
leader with the public, as the&s;e fanatical enter|tainments.
And as the puritanical preachers frequently
inculcated in their &s;ermons the doctrine of re&s;i&s;tance
to the civil magi&s;trate, they prepared the minds of
their hearers for tho&s;e purpo&s;es which E&s;&s;ex was &s;ecretly
contriving<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 463. Camden, p. 630.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t imprudence of this nobleman pro|ceeded
from the openne&s;s of his temper, by which he was
ill qualified to &s;ucceed in &s;uch difficult and dangerous
projects. He indulged him&s;elf $$$great liberties of
&s;peech, and was even heard to &s;ay of the Queen, that

upon her beauty; nor had all her good &s;en&s;e been able
to cure her of this prepo&s;terous infirmity<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;t of Queen Elizabeth's courtiers &s;eigned love and de&s;ire towards her, and addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to her in the &s;tile of pa&s;&s;ion and gallantry. Sir Walter Raleigh, having fallen into di&s;grace, wrote the following letter to his friend Sir Robert Cecil, with a view, no doubt, of having it &s;hewn to the Queen. &startq;My heart was never broke till this day, that I hear the Queen goes away &s;o far off, whom I have followed &s;o many years, with &s;o great love and de&s;ire, in &s;o many journeys, and am now left behind her in a dark pri&s;on all alone. While &s;he was yet near at hand, that I might hear of her once in two or three days, my &s;orrows were the le&s;s; but even now my heart is ca&s;t into the depth of all mi&s;ery. I, that was wont to behold her riding like <HI>Alexander,</HI> hunting like <HI>Diana,</HI> walking like <HI>Venus,</HI> the gentle wind blowing her fair hair about her pure cheeks, like a nymph, &s;ometimes &s;itting in the &s;hade like a Godde&s;s, &s;ometimes &s;inging like an angel, &s;ometimes playing like <HI>Orpheus;</HI> behold the &s;or|row of this world! once ami&s;s hath bereaved me of all. O glory that only &s;hineth in misfortune, what is become of thy a&s;&s;urance? All wounds have &s;cars but that of fanta&s;ie: All affections their relenting but that of womankind. Who is the judge of friend&s;hip but adver&s;ity, or when is grace witne&s;&s;ed but in offences? There were no divinity but by rea&s;on of compa&s;&s;ion: For revenges are bruti&s;h and mortal. All tho&s;e times pa&s;t, the loves, the &s;ighs, the &s;orrows, the de&s;ires, cannot they weigh down one frail misfortune? Cannot one drop of gall be hid in &s;o great heaps of &s;weetne&s;s? I may then conclude, <HI>Spes $ fortuna, valete.</HI> She is gone in whom I tru&s;ted; and of me hath not one thought of mercy, nor any re&s;pect of that which was. Do with me now there|fore what you li&s;t. I am more weary of life than they are de&s;irous I &s;hould peri&s;h; which, if it had been for her, as it is by her, I had been too happily born.&endq; <HI>Murdin,</HI> 657. It is to be remarked, that this Nymph, Venu$, Gdde&s;s, Angel, was now about &s;ixty. Yet five or &s;ix years after, &s;he allowed the &s;ame language to be u&s;ed to her. Sir Henry Unton, her amba&s;&s;ador in France, relates to her a conver&s;ation which he had with Henry the fourth. The Monarch, after having introduced Unton to his mi&s;tre&s;s, the fair Gabrielle, a&s;ked him how he liked her. &startq;I an|&s;wered &s;paringly in her prai&s;e,&endq; &s;aid the mini&s;ter, &startq;and told him, that if, without offence, I might &s;peak it, I had the picture of a far more excellent mi&s;tre&s;s, and yet did her picture come far &s;hort of her per|fection of beauty. As you love me, &s;aid he, &s;hew it me, if you have it about you. I made &s;ome difficulties; yet upon his importunity offered it to his view very &s;ecretly, holding it &s;till in my hand: He beheld it with pa&s;&s;ion and admiration, &s;aying, that I had rea&s;on, <HI>Je me rends,</HI> prote&s;ting, that he had never &s;een the like: &s;o, with great re|verence, he ki&s;&s;ed it twice or thrice, I detaining it &s;till in my hand. In the end, with &s;ome kind of contention, he took it from me, vowing, that I might take my leave of it: For he would not forego it for any trea&s;ure: And that to po&s;&s;e&s;s the favour of the lively picture, he would for&s;ake all the world, and hold him&s;elf mo&s;t happy; with many other mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate &s;peeches.&endq; <HI>Murdin,</HI> p. 718.

THERE was another expedient employed by E&s;&s;ex,
which, if po&s;&s;ible, was more provoking to the Queen
than tho&s;e &s;arca&s;ms on her age and deformity; and
that was, his &s;ecret applications to the King of Scots,
her heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or. That prince had this year
very narrowly e&s;caped a dangerous, tho' ill formed,
con&s;piracy of the earl of Gowry; and even his deli|very
was attended with this di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance,
that the ob&s;tinate eccle&s;ia&s;tics per&s;i&s;ted, in &s;pite of the
mo&s;t inconte&s;table evidence, to maintain to his face, that
there had been no &s;uch con&s;piracy. James, harra&s;&s;ed
with his turbulent and factious &s;ubjects, ca&s;t a wi&s;hful
eye to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of England; and in proportion
as the Queen advanced in years, his de&s;ire increa&s;ed
of mounting that throne, on which, be&s;ides acquiring
a great addition of power and &s;plendor, he hoped to go|vern
a people, &s;o much more tractable and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive.
He negociated with all the courts of Europe, in order
to en&s;ure him&s;elf friends and partizans: He even neg|lected
not the court of Rome and that of Spain;
and tho' he engaged him&s;elf in no po&s;itive promi&s;e, he
flattered the catholics with hopes, that, in ca&s;e of his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, they might expect &s;ome more liberty
<PB N="438" REF="489">
than what was at pre&s;ent indulged them. Elizabeth
was the only &s;overeign in Europe to whom he never
dared to mention his right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: He knew,
that tho' her great age might now invite her to think
of fixing an heir to the crown, &s;he never could bear
the pro&s;pect of her own death without horror, and was
determined &s;till to retain him, and all other competitors,
in an entire dependance upon her.</P>
<P>ESSEX was de&s;cended by females from the royal
family; and &s;ome of his &s;anguine partizans had been
&s;o imprudent as to mention his name among tho&s;e of
other pretenders to the crown; but the earl took care,
by means of Henry Lee, whom he &s;ecretly &s;ent into
Scotland, to a&s;&s;ure James, that, &s;o far from entertaining
&s;uch ambitious views, he was determined to u&s;e every
expedient for extorting an immediate declaration in
favour of that monarch's right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. James
willingly hearkened to this propo&s;al; but did not ap|prove
of the violent methods which E&s;&s;ex intended to
employ. E&s;&s;ex had communicated his &s;cheme to
Mountjoy, lord deputy of Ireland; and as no man
ever commanded more the cordial affection and at|tachment
of his friends, he had even engaged a per&s;on
of that virtue and prudence to entertain thoughts of
bringing over part of his army into England, and of
forcing the Queen to declare the King of Scots her
&s;ucce&s;&s;or<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 471.</NOTE>. And &s;uch was E&s;&s;ex's impatient ardour,
that, tho' James declined this dangerous expedient,
he &s;till endeavoured to per&s;uade Moun$joy not to de&s;i&s;t
from the project: But the deputy who thought that
&s;uch violence, tho' it might be prudent, and even
ju&s;tifiable, when &s;upported by a &s;overeign prince next
heir to the crown, would be ra&s;h and criminal, if at|tempted
<PB N="439" REF="490">
by &s;ubjects, entirely refu&s;ed his concurrence.
The corre&s;pondence, however, between E&s;&s;ex and the
court of Scotland was &s;till conducted with great &s;e|crecy
and cordiality; and that nobleman, be&s;ides con|ciliating
the favour of James, repre&s;ented all his own
adver&s;aries as enemies to that prince's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and
as men entirely devoted to the intere&s;ts of Spain, and
partizans of the chimerical title of the Infanta.</P>
<P>THE Infanta and archduke, Albert, had made &s;ome
advances to the Queen for peace; and Boulogne, as
a neutral town, was cho&s;en for the place of confer|ence.
Sir Henry Nevil, the Engli&s;h re&s;ident in France,
Herbert, Edmondes, and Beale, were &s;ent thither as
amba&s;&s;adors from England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th May.</NOTE> and negociated with Zu|niga,
Carillo, Rachardot, and Verheiken, mini&s;ters
of Spain and the archduke: But the con&s;erences were
&s;oon broke off, on account of a di&s;pute of ceremony.
Among the European &s;tates England had ever been
allowed the precedency above Ca&s;tile, Arragon, Por|tugal,
and the other kingdoms of which the Spani&s;h
monarchy was compo&s;ed; and Elizabeth in&s;i&s;ted, that
this ancient right was not lo&s;t on account of the junc|tion
of the&s;e &s;tates, and that Spain, in its pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion,
tho' it &s;urpa&s;&s;ed England in extent, as well as in
power, could not compare with it in point of antiquity,
the only durable and regular foundation of precedency
among kingdoms, as well as noble families. That &s;he
might &s;hew, however, a di&s;po&s;ition to peace, &s;he was
contented to yield to an equality; but the Spani&s;h
mini&s;ters, as their country had always di&s;puted prece|dency
even with France, to which England yielded,
would proceed no farther in the conference, till their
&s;uperiority of rank was acknowledged.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Winwood's Memorials, vol. I. p. 186&mdash;226.</NOTE>. During the
<PB N="440" REF="491">
preparations for this abortive negociation, the earl of
Nottingham, the admiral lord Buckhur&s;t, the trea|&s;urer,
and &s;ecretary Cecil, had di&s;covered their incli|nation
to peace; and as the Engli&s;h nation, flu&s;hed
with &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;anguine in their hopes of plunder
and conque&s;t, were in general aver&s;e to that mea&s;ure,
it was ea&s;y for a per&s;on &s;o popular as E&s;&s;ex, to infu&s;e
into the multitude an opinion, that the&s;e mini&s;ters
had &s;acrificed the intere&s;ts of their country to Spain,
and would even make no &s;cruple of receiving a &s;overeign
from that ho&s;tile nation.</P>
<P>BUT E&s;&s;ex, not contented with the&s;e arts for de|crying
his adver&s;aries, proceeded to concert more vio|lent
methods of ruining them; chiefly in&s;tigated by
Cuffe, his &s;ecretary, a man of a bold and arrogant
&s;pirit, who had acquired a great a&s;cendant over his
patron. A &s;elect council of malecontents was formed,
who commonly met at Drury-hou&s;e, and were com|po&s;ed
of Sir Charles Davers, to whom the hou&s;e be|longed,
the earl of Southampton, Sir Ferdinando
Gorges, Sir Chri&s;topher Blount, Sir John Davis, and
John Littleton; and E&s;&s;ex, who boa&s;ted, that he had
and hundred and twenty barons, knights, and gentle|men
of note, at his devotion, and who tru&s;ted &s;till
more to his authority with the populace, communi|cated
to his a&s;&s;ociates tho&s;e &s;ecret de&s;igns and re&s;olu|tions,
with which his confidence in &s;o powerful a
party had in&s;pired him. Among other criminal pro|jects,
the re&s;ult of blind rage and de&s;pir, he deliberat|ed
with them concerning the method of taking arms;
and a&s;ked their opinion whether he had be&s;t begin
with &s;eizing the palace or the Tower, or &s;et out with
making him&s;elf ma&s;ter at once of both places. The
fir&s;t enterprize being preferred, a method was con|certed
for executing it. It was agreed, that Sir Chri&s;to|pher

<P>WHILE the&s;e de&s;perate projects were in agitation,
many rea&s;ons of &s;u&s;picion were carried to the Queen;
and &s;he &s;ent Robert Sacville, the trea&s;urer's &s;on, to
E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e on pretence of a vi&s;it, but, in reality,
with a view of di&s;covering whether there was in that
place any concour&s;e of people, or any extraordinary
preparations, which might threaten an in&s;urrection.
Soon after, E&s;&s;ex received a &s;ummons to attend the
council, which met at the trea&s;urer's hou&s;e; and while
he was mu&s;ing on this circum&s;tance, and comparing
it with the late unexpected vi&s;it from Sacville, a private
note was conveyed to him, by which he was warned
to provide for his own &s;afety. He concluded, that all
his con&s;piracy was di&s;covered, or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected, and
that the ea&s;ie&s;t puni&s;hment which he could expect, was
a new and more &s;evere confinement: He therefore ex|cu&s;ed
him&s;elf to the council on pretence of an indi&s;po|&s;ition;
and he immediately di&s;patched me&s;&s;ages to his
more intimate confederates, reque&s;ting their advice and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation of his affairs.
They deliberated, whether they &s;hould abandon all
their projects, and fly the kingdom; or in&s;tantly &s;eize
the palace with the force which they could a&s;&s;emble;
or rely upon the affections of the citizens, who were
<PB N="442" REF="493">
generally known to bear a great affection to the earl.
E&s;&s;ex declared again&s;t the fir&s;t expedient, and profe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf determined to undergo any fate rather than
&s;ubmit to live the life of a fugitive. To &s;eize the
palace &s;eemed impracticable without more preparation;
e&s;pecially as the Queen &s;eemed now aware of their
projects, and, as they heard, had u&s;ed the precaution
of doubling her ordinary guards. There remained,
therefore, no other expedient but that of betaking
them&s;elves to the city; and while the prudence and
expediency of this re&s;olution was under debate, a per|&s;on
arrived, who, as if he had received a commi&s;&s;ion
for that purpo&s;e, gave them a&s;&s;urance of the affection of
the Londoners, and affirmed, that they might &s;ecurely
re&s;t any project on that foundation. The popularity
of E&s;&s;ex had chiefly buoyed him up in all his vain un|dertakings;
and he fondly imagined, that with no
other a&s;&s;i&s;tance than the good will of the multitude,
he might be enabled to overturn Elizabeth's goven|ment,
confirmed by time, revered for wi&s;dom, &s;up|ported
by vigour, and concurring with the general
&s;entiments of the nation. The wild project of rai&s;ing
the city was immediately re&s;olved on; the execution
of it was delayed till next day; and emi&s;&s;aries were
di&s;patched to all E&s;&s;ex's friends, informing them that
Cobham and Raleigh had laid &s;chemes again&s;t his life,
and entreating their pre&s;ence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>NEXT day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th Fe|bruary.</NOTE> there appeared at E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e the earls
of Southampton and Rutland, the lords Sandys and
Monteagle, with about three hundred gentlemen of
good quality and fortune; and E&s;&s;ex informed them
of the danger, to which, he pretended, the machina|tions
of his enemies expo&s;ed him. To &s;ome, he &s;aid,
that he would throw him&s;elf at the Queen's feet, and
crave her ju&s;tice and protection: To others, he boa&s;ted
<PB N="443" REF="494">
of his intere&s;t in the city, and affirmed, that, what|ever
might happen, this re&s;ource could never fail him.
The queen was informed of the&s;e de&s;igns, by means of
intelligence, conveyed, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, to Raleigh by
Sir Ferdinando Gorges; and having ordered the ma|gi&s;trates
of London to keep the citizens in readine&s;s,
&s;he &s;ent Egerton, lord keeper, to E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e, with the
earl of Worce&s;ter, Sir William Knollys, controller,
and Popham, lord chief ju&s;tice, in order to learn the
cau&s;e of the&s;e unu&s;ual commotions. They were with
difficulty admitted thro'a wicket; but all their &s;ervants
were excluded, except the pur&s;e-bearer. After &s;ome
altercation, in which they charged E&s;&s;ex's retainers,
upon their allegiance, to lay down their arms, and
were menaced in their turn by the angry multitude,
who &s;urrounded them, the earl, who found, that mat|ters
were pa&s;t recal, re&s;olved to leave them pri&s;oners
in his hou&s;e, and to proceed to the execution of his
former project. He i&s;&s;ued out with about two hundred
attendants, armed only with &s;words; and in his pa&s;&s;age
to the city was joined by the earl of Bedford and lord
Cromwel. He cried aloud, <HI>For the Queen! for the
Queen! a plot is laid for my life;</HI> and then proceeded
to the hou&s;e of Smith, the &s;heriff, on who&s;e aid he
had great reliance. The citizens flocked about him
in amazement; but tho' he told them, that England
was &s;old to the infanta, and exhorted them to arm
in&s;tantly, otherwi&s;e they could not do him any &s;ervice,
no one &s;howed a di&s;po&s;ition to join him. The &s;heriff,
on the earl's approach to his hou&s;e, &s;tole out at the
back door, and made the be&s;t of his way to the lord
mayor. E&s;&s;ex, meanwhile, ob&s;erving the coldne&s;s of
the citizens, and hearing, that he was proclaimed a
traitor by the earl of Cumberland and lord Burleigh,
<PB N="444" REF="495">
began to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, and thought of retreating
to his own hou&s;e. He found the &s;treets in his pa&s;&s;age
barricadoed, and guarded by the citizens under the
command of Sir John Levi&s;on. In his attempt to
force his way, Tracy, a young gentleman, to whom
he bore great friend&s;hip, was killed with two or three
of the Londoners; and the earl him&s;elf, attended by
a few of his partizans (for the greate&s;t part began &s;e|cretly
to withdraw them&s;elves) retired towards the
river, and taking boat, arrived at E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e. He
there found, that Gorges, whom he had &s;ent before
to capitulate with the lord keeper and the other coun|&s;ellors,
had given them all their liberty, and had gone
to court with them. He was now reduced to de&s;pair;
and appeared determined, in pro&s;ecution of lord San|dys's
advice, to defend him&s;elf to the la&s;t extremity,
and rather to peri&s;h, like a brave man, with his &s;word
in his hand, than ba&s;ely by the hands of the executi|oner:
But after &s;ome parley, and after demanding in
vain, fir&s;t ho&s;tages, then conditions, from the be&s;iegers,
he &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion; reque&s;ting only civil
treatment, and a fair and impartial hearing<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 632.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen, who, during all this commotion, had
behaved with as great tranquillity and &s;ecurity, as if
there had only pa&s;&s;ed a fray in the &s;treets, in which
&s;he was no way concerned<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 469.</NOTE>, &s;oon gave orders for the
trial of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the criminals.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th February. His trial.</NOTE> The
earls of E&s;&s;ex and Southampton were arraigned before
a jury of twenty-five peers, where Buckhur&s;t acted
as lord &s;teward. The guilt of the pri&s;oners was too
apparent to admit of any doubt; and, be&s;ides the in|&s;urrection
known to every body, the trea&s;onable con|ferences
<PB N="445" REF="496">
at Drury-hou&s;e were proved by undoubted evi|dence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1600.</NOTE> Sir Ferdinando Gorges was produced in court:
The confe&s;&s;ions of the earl of Rutland, of the lords
Cromwel, Sandys, and Monteagle, of Davers, Blount,
and Davies, were only read to the peers, according
to the practice of that age. E&s;&s;ex's be&s;t friends were
&s;candalized at his a&s;&s;urance in in&s;i&s;ting &s;o po&s;itively
on his innocence, and the goodne&s;s of his intentions;
and &s;till more at his vindictive di&s;po&s;ition, in accu&s;ing,
without any appearance of rea&s;on, &s;ecretary Cecil as
partizan of the infanta's title. The &s;ecretary who
had expected this charge, &s;tepped into the court, and
challenged E&s;&s;ex to produce his authority, which, on
examination, was found extremely weak and frivolous<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 530.</NOTE>
When &s;entence was pronounced, E&s;&s;ex &s;poke like a
man who laid his account to die: But he added, that
he &s;hould be &s;orry, if he was repre&s;ented to the Queen
as a per&s;on that de&s;pi&s;ed her clemency; tho' he &s;hould
not, he believed, make any cringing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to
obtain it. Southampton's behaviour was more mild
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive: He entreated the good offices of the
peers in &s;o modeft and becoming a manner, as excited
compa&s;&s;ion in every one.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance in E&s;&s;ex's trial
was Bacon's appearance again&s;t him. He was none
of the crown lawyers; &s;o was not obliged by his
office to a&s;&s;i&s;t at this trial: Yet did he not &s;cruple, in
order to obtain the Queen's favour, to be active in
bereaving of life his friend and patron, who&s;e genero&s;ity
he had often experienced. He compared E&s;&s;ex's con|duct,
in pretending to fear the attempts of his adver|&s;aries,
to that of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, the Athenian, who cut
and wounded his own body; and making the people

believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1601.</NOTE> that his enemies had committed that violence,
obtained a guard for his per&s;on, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he
afterwards &s;ubdued the liberties of his country.</P>
<P>AFTER E&s;&s;ex had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days in the &s;olitude
and reflexion of a pri&s;on, his proud heart was at la&s;t
&s;ubdued, not by the fear of death, but by the &s;enti|ments
of religion; a principle, which he had before
attempted to make the in&s;trument of his ambition, but
which now took a more firm hold of his mind, and
prevailed over every other motive and con&s;ideration.
His &s;piritual directors per&s;uaded him, that he never
could obtain the pardon of heaven, unle&s;s he made a
full confe&s;&s;ion of his di&s;loyalty; and he gave in to
the council an account of all his mo&s;t criminal de&s;igns,
as well as of his corre&s;pondence with the King of Scots.
He &s;pared not even his mo&s;t intimate friends, &s;uch as
lord Mountjoy, whom he had engaged in the&s;e con|&s;piracies;
and he &s;ought to pacify his pre&s;ent remor&s;e,
by making &s;uch attonements as in any other period
of his life, he would have deemed more blameable than
tho&s;e attempts them&s;elves, which were the objects of
his penitence<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol, I. p. 300.</NOTE>. Sir Harry Nevil, in particular, a man
of merit, he accu&s;ed of a corre&s;pondence with the con|&s;pirators;
tho' it appears, that that gentleman had
never a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;als made him, and was no
farther criminal than in not revealing the earl's trea&s;on;
an office to which every man of honour naturally bears
the &s;tronge&s;t reluctance<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 302.</NOTE>. Nevil was thrown into
pri&s;on, and underwent a &s;evere per&s;ecution: But as
the Queen found Mountjoy a very able and &s;ucce&s;sful
commander, &s;he continued him in his government, and
&s;acrificed her re&s;entment to the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="500">
ELIZABETH affected extremely the prai&s;e of cle|mency;
and in every great example, which &s;he had
made during her reign, &s;he had always appeared full
of reluctance and he&s;itation: But the pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion
of E&s;&s;ex called forth all her tender affections,
and kept her in the mo&s;t real agitation and irre&s;olution.
She felt a perpetual combat between re&s;entment and
inclination, pride and compa&s;&s;ion, the care of her own
&s;afety and concern for her favourite; and her &s;ituation,
during this interval, was perhaps more an object of
pity, than that to which E&s;&s;ex him&s;elf was reduced.
She &s;igned the warrant for his execution; &s;he counter-manded
it; &s;he again re&s;olved on his death; &s;he felt
a new return of tenderne&s;s. E&s;&s;ex's enemies told her,
that he him&s;elf de&s;ired to die, and had a&s;&s;ured her,
that &s;he could never be in &s;afety while he lived: It
is likely, that this proof of penitence and of concern
for her, would operate a contrary effect to what they
intended, and would revive all that fond affection,
which &s;he had &s;o long indulged to the unhappy pri|&s;oner.
But what chiefly hardened her heart again&s;t him
was his &s;uppo&s;ed ob&s;tinacy, in never making, as &s;he
hourly expected, any application to her for mercy
and forgivene&s;s; and &s;he finally gave her con&s;ent to
his execution. He di&s;covered at his death &s;ymptoms
rather of penitence and piety than of fear; and wil|lingly
acknowledged the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence, by
which he &s;uffered. The execution was private in the
Tower,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Febru|ary.</NOTE> agreeable to his own reque&s;t. He was ap|prehen&s;ive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And execution.</NOTE>
he &s;aid, left the favour and compa&s;&s;ion of
the people would too much rai&s;e his heart in tho&s;e
moments when humiliation under the afflicting hand
of heaven was the only proper &s;entiment, which he
<PB N="448" REF="501">
could indulge<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Dr. Barlow's &s;ermon on E&s;&s;ex's execution. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 534.</NOTE>. And the Queen, no doubt, thought,
that prudence required the removal of &s;o melancholy
a &s;pectacle from the public eye. Sir Walter Raleigh,
who came to the Tower on purpo&s;e, and who beheld
E&s;&s;ex's execution from a window, encrea&s;ed much
by this action the general hatred, under which he
already laboured: It was thought, that he had no
other purpo&s;e than to fea&s;t his eyes with the death of
his enemy; and no apology, which he could make
for &s;o exceptionable a conduct, could be accepted by
the public. The cruelty and animo&s;ity, with which
he urged on E&s;&s;ex's fate, even when Cecil relented<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Murdin, p. 811.</NOTE>,
were &s;till regarded as the principles of this unmanly
and ungenerous behaviour.</P>
<P>THE earl of E&s;&s;ex was but thirty-four years of age,
when his ra&s;hne&s;s, imprudence, and violence brought
him to this untimely end. We mu&s;t here, as in
many other in&s;tances, lament the incon&s;tancy of
human nature, that a per&s;on endowed with &s;o many
noble virtues, genero&s;ity, &s;incerity, friend&s;hip, valour,
eloquence, and indu&s;try, &s;hould in the latter period
of his life have given &s;uch reins to his ungovernable
pa&s;&s;ions, as involved, not only him&s;elf, but many of
his friends, in utter ruin. The Queen's tenderne&s;s
and pa&s;&s;ion for him, as it was $word$ cau&s;e of tho&s;e pre|mature
honours, which he attained, &s;eems, on the
whole, the chief circum&s;tance which brought on his
de&s;truction. Confident of her partiality towards him,
as well as of his own merit, he treated her with a
haughtine&s;s, which neither her love nor her dignity
could bear; and as her amorous inclinations in &s;o ad|vanced
an age, would naturally make her appear ri|diculous,
<PB N="449" REF="502">
if not hateful in his eyes, he was engaged,
by an imprudent openne&s;s, of which he made pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
to di&s;cover too ea&s;ily tho&s;e &s;entiments to her.
The many reconciliations and returns of affection,
of which he had &s;till made advantage, induced him to
venture on new provocations, till he pu&s;hed her be|yond
all bounds of patience; and he forgot, that, tho'
the &s;entiments of the woman were ever &s;trong in her,
tho&s;e of the &s;overeign had &s;till in the end appeared
predominant.</P>
<P>SOME of E&s;&s;ex's a&s;&s;ociates, Cuffe, Davers, Blount,
Meric, and Davis were tried and condemned, and
all of them, except Davis, were executed. The
Queen pardoned the re&s;t; being per&s;uaded that they
were drawn in merely from their friend&s;hip to that
nobleman, and their care of his &s;afety; and were
ignorant of the more criminal part of his intentions.
Southampton's life was &s;pared with great difficulty;
but he was detained in pri&s;on during all the remainder
of this reign.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots, who was apprehen&s;ive le&s;t
his corre&s;pondence with E&s;&s;ex might have been di&s;co|vered,
and have given offence to Elizabeth, &s;ent the
earl of Marre and the lord Kinlo&s;s as amba&s;&s;adors to
England, in order to congratulate the Queen on her
e&s;cape from the late in&s;urrection and con&s;piracy. They
were al&s;o ordered to enquire whether any mea&s;ures
had been taken by her to exclude him from the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
as well as to di&s;cover the inclinations of the
chief nobility and coun&s;ellors, in ca&s;e of the Queen's
demi&s;e<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 510.</NOTE>. They found the di&s;po&s;itions of men as fa|vourable
as they could wi&s;h; and they even entered
into a corre&s;pondence with &s;ecretary Cecil, who&s;e in|fluence,
after the fall of E&s;&s;ex, was now uncontrouled<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">O&s;borne, p. 615.</NOTE>,
<PB N="450" REF="503">
and who was re&s;olved, by this policy, to acquire, in
time, the confidence of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He knew how
jealous Elizabeth ever was of her authority, and he
therefore carefully concealed from her his attachment
to James: But he afterwards a&s;&s;erted, that nothing
could be more advantageous to her, than this corre&s;|pondence;
becau&s;e the King of Scots, &s;ecure of
mounting the throne by his undoubted title, aided by
tho&s;e connexions with the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, was the
le&s;s likely to give any di&s;turbance to the pre&s;ent &s;o|vereign.
He al&s;o per&s;uaded that prince to remain in
quiet, and patiently to expect, that time &s;hould open
to him the inheritance of the throne, without pu&s;hing
his friends on de&s;perate enterprizes which would totally
incapacitate them from &s;erving him. James's equity,
as well as his natural facility of di&s;po&s;ition, ea&s;ily in|clined
him to embrace this re&s;olution<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 471, 472.</NOTE>; and thus the
minds of the Engli&s;h were &s;ilently, but univer&s;ally
di&s;po&s;ed to admit, without oppo&s;ition the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of the Scotti&s;h line: The death of E&s;&s;ex, by putting
an end to faction, had been rather favourable than pre|judicial
to that great event.</P>
<P>THE King of France, who was little prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
in favour of James, and who was aver&s;e to the union
of England and Scotland<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 352.</NOTE>, made his amba&s;&s;ador drop
&s;ome hints to Cecil of Henry's willingne&s;s to concu$
in any mea&s;ure for di&s;appointing the hopes of the
Scotti&s;h monarch; but as Cecil &s;howed an entire di&s;|approbation
of &s;uch &s;chemes; the court of France
took no farther &s;teps in that matter; and thus the only
foreign power, which could give much di&s;turbance to
James's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$</NOTE> was induced to acquie&s;ce in it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;woo$ p. 47$.</NOTE>&punc;
Henry made a journey this &s;ummer to Calais; and the
Queen, hearing of his intentions, went to Dover
<PB N="451" REF="504">
in hopes of having a per&s;onal interview with a mon|arch,
whom, of all others, &s;he mo&s;t loved and mo&s;t
re&s;pected. The French King, who felt the &s;ame &s;enti|ments
towards her, would gladly have accepted of the
propo&s;al; but as many difficulties occurred, it appeared
nece&s;&s;ary to lay a&s;ide, by common con&s;ent, the pro|ject
of an inte$view. Elizabeth, however, wrote &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
two letters to Henry, one by Edmondes,
another by Sir Robert Sydney, in which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed
a de&s;ire of conferring about a bu&s;ine&s;s of importance,
with &s;ome mini&s;ter in whom that prince repo&s;ed entire
confidence. The marque&s;s of Rhoni, the King's fa|vouite
and prime mini&s;ter, came to Dover in di&s;gui&s;e;
and the memoirs of that able &s;tate&s;man contain a
full account of his conver&s;ation with Elizabeth. That
magnanimous prince&s;s had formed a &s;cheme of e&s;ta|bli&s;hing,
in conjunction with Henry, a new &s;y&s;tem
of policy in Europe, and of fixing a durable ballance
of power, by the erection of new &s;tates on the ruins
of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. She had even the wi&s;dom to
fore&s;ee the perils, which might en&s;ue from the ag|grandizement
of her ally; and &s;he propo&s;ed to unite
all the &s;eventeen provinces of the Low Countries into
one republic, in order to form a perpetual barrier
again&s;t the dangerous encrea&s;e of the French, as well
as of the Spani&s;h, monarchy. Henry had him&s;elf
long meditated &s;uch a project again&s;t the Au&s;trian fa|mily;
and Rhoni could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing his
a&s;toni&s;hment, when he found that Elizabeth and his
ma&s;ter, tho' they had never communicated their
thoughts on this &s;ubject, had not only entered into
the &s;ame general views, but had al&s;o formed the &s;ame
project for their execution. The affairs, however,
of France were not yet brought to a &s;ituation, which
might enable Henry to begin that great enterprize;
and Rhoni &s;atisfied the Queen, that it would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary

to po&s;tpone for &s;ome years their united attack
on the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. He departed, filled with
ju&s;t admiration of the &s;olid$$ of Elizabeth's judgment,
and the greatne&s;s of her mind; and he owns that &s;he
was entirely worthy of that high reputation, which
&s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Europe.</P>
<P>THE Queen's magnanimity in forming &s;uch exten|&s;ive
projects was the more remarkable, as, be&s;ides her
having fallen &s;o far into the decline of life, the affairs
of Ireland, tho' conducted with ability and &s;ucce&s;s,
were &s;till in di&s;order, and made a great diver&s;ion of
her forces. The expence incurred by this war lay
heavy upon her narrow revenues; and her mini&s;ters,
taking advantage of her great di&s;po&s;ition to frugality,
propo&s;ed to her an expedient of &s;aving, which, tho'
&s;he at fir&s;t di&s;approved of it, &s;he was at la&s;t induced
to embrace. It was repre&s;ented to her, that the great
&s;ums of money remitted to Ireland for the pay of the
Engli&s;h forces, came, by the nece&s;&s;ary cour&s;e of cir|culation,
into the hands of the rebels, and enabled
them to buy abroad all nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of arms and
ammunition, which, from the extreme poverty of that
kingdom and its want of every u&s;eful commodity, they
could not otherwi&s;e find means to purcha&s;e. It was
therefore propo&s;ed to her, that &s;he &s;hould pay her
forces in money of a ba&s;e alloy; and it was a&s;&s;erted,
that, be&s;ides the great &s;aving to the revenue, this &s;pecies
of coin could never be exported with advantage, and
would not pa&s;s in any foreign market. Some of the
wi&s;er coun&s;ellors maintained, that, if the pay of the
&s;oldiers was rai&s;ed in proportion, the Iri&s;h rebels would
nece&s;&s;arily reap the &s;ame benefit from the ba&s;e money,
which would always be taken at a rate &s;uitable to its
value; if the pay was not rai&s;ed, there was danger
of a mutiny among the troops, who, whatever names
might be aff$xed to the pieces of metal, would &s;oon
find from experience that they were defrauded in their

and fore&s;eeing the danger of mutiny among the troops,
he led them in&s;tantly into the field, and re&s;olved, by
means of &s;trict di&s;cipline, and by keeping them em|ployed
again&s;t the enemy, to obviate tho&s;e inconve|niencies,
which were ju&s;tly apprehended. He made
military roads, and built a fortre&s;s at Moghery; he
drove the Mac-Geni&s;es out of Lecale; he harra&s;&s;ed
Tyrone in Ul&s;ter with inroads and le&s;&s;er expeditions;
and by de&s;troying, every where, and during all &s;ea&s;ons,
the provi&s;ions of the Iri&s;h, he reduced them to peri&s;h
with famine in the woods and mora&s;&s;es, to which
they were obliged to retreat. At the &s;ame time, Sir
Henry Docwray, who commanded another body of
troops, took the ca&s;tle of Derry, and put garri&s;ons
into Newton and Ainogh; and having &s;eized the mo|na&s;tery
of Donnegal near Bali&s;hannon, he threw troops
into it, and defended it again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of O'Don|nel
and the Iri&s;h. Nor was Sir George Carew idle in
the province of Mun&s;ter. He &s;eized the titular earl of
De&s;mond, and &s;ent him over, with Florence Macarty,
another chieftain, pri&s;oner to England. He arre&s;ted
many &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, and took ho&s;tages from others.
And having got a reinforcement of two thou&s;and men
from England, he threw him&s;elf into Corke, which
he &s;upplied with arms and provi&s;ions; and he put

every thing in a condition for re&s;i&s;ting the Spani&s;h
inva&s;ion, which was daily expected. The deputy,
informed of the danger, to which the &s;outhern pro|vinces
were expo&s;ed, left the pro&s;ecution of the war
again&s;t Tyrone, who was reduced to great extre|mity;
and he marched with his army into Mun|&s;ter.</P>
<P>At
la&s;t, the Spaniards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Septem|ber.</NOTE> under Don John d'Aquila,
arrived at King&s;ale; and Sir Richard Piercy, who com|manded
in the town with a &s;mall garri&s;on of an hun|dred
and fifty men, found him&s;elf obliged to abandon
it on their appearance. The&s;e invaders amounted to
four thou&s;and men, and the Iri&s;h expre&s;&s;ed a great
de&s;ire to join them, in order to free them&s;elves from the
Engli&s;h government, with which they were extreme|ly
di&s;contented. One chief ground of their com|plaint
was the introduction of their trials by jury<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 644.</NOTE>;
an in&s;titution, abhorred by this barbarous nation,
tho' nothing contributes more to the &s;upport of that
equity and liberty, for which the Engli&s;h laws are &s;o
ju&s;tly celebrated. The Iri&s;h al&s;o bore a great favour
to the Spaniards, having entertained the opinion that
they them&s;elves were de&s;cended from that nation; and
their attachment to the catholic religion proved a
new cau&s;e of affection to the invaders. D'Aquila
a&s;&s;umed the title of general <HI>in the holy war for the pre&s;er|vation
of the faith</HI> in Ireland, and he endeavoured to
per&s;uade the people, that Queen Elizabeth was, by
&s;everal bulls of the p$pe, deprived of her crown;
that her &s;ubjects were ab&s;olved from their oaths of alle|giance;
and that the Spaniards were come to deliver
the Iri&s;h from the power of the devil<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 645.</NOTE>. Mountjoy
found it nece&s;&s;ary to act with vigour, in order to pre|vent
a total in&s;urrection of the Iri&s;h; and having ga|thered
<PB N="455" REF="512">
together his forces, he formed the &s;iege of
Kin&s;ale by land; while Sir Richard Levi&s;on, with a
&s;mall &s;quadron, blockaded it by &s;ea. He had no &s;ooner
begun his operations than he heard of the arrival of an|other
body of two thou&s;and Spaniards under the com|mand
of Alphon&s;o Ocampo, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Baltimore and Berehaven; and he found him&s;elf obliged
to detach Sir George Carew to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s.
Tyrone, meanwhile, with Randal, Mac-Surley, Tirel
baron of Kelley, and other chieftains of the Iri&s;h, had
joined Ocampo with all their forces, and were march|ing
to the relief of Kin&s;ale. The deputy, informed of
their de&s;ign by intercepted letters, made preparations
to receive them; and being joined by Levi&s;on with
&s;ix hundred marines, he po&s;ted his troops on an ad|vantageous
ground, which lay on their pa&s;&s;age, leav|ing
&s;ome cavalry to prevent a &s;ally from D'Aquila and
the Spani&s;h garri&s;on. When Tyrone, with a body of
Iri&s;h and Spaniards, approached, he was &s;urprized to
find the Engli&s;h &s;o well po&s;ted, and ranged in &s;uch good
order; and he immediately &s;ounded a retreat: But the
deputy gave orders to pur&s;ue him; and having thrown
the&s;e advanced troops into di&s;order, he followed them
to the main body, whom he al&s;o attacked, and put to
flight, with the &s;laughter of twelve hundred men<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. I. p. 359.</NOTE>.
Ocampo was taken pri&s;oner; Tyrone fled, into Ul|&s;ter;
Odonel made his e&s;cape into Spain; and D'Aquila,
finding him&s;elf reduced to the greate&s;t difficulties,
was obliged to capitulate upon &s;uch terms as the de|puty
pre&s;cribed to him: He &s;urrendered Kin&s;ale and
Baltimore, and agreed to evacuate the kingdom. This
great blow, joined to other &s;ucce&s;&s;es, gained by Wilmot,
governor of Kerry, and by Roger and Gavin Harvey,
threw the rebels into di&s;may, and gave a pro&s;pect of
the final reduction of that Kingdom.</P>

THE Iri&s;h war, tho' &s;ucce&s;sful, was extremely bur|then&s;ome
on the Queen's reyenue; and be&s;ides the &s;up|plies
granted by Parliament, which were indeed very
&s;mall, but which they ever regarded as mighty con|ce&s;&s;ions,
&s;he had been obliged, notwith&s;tanding her

again to &s;ummon a Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 October. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> and it here appeared,
that, tho' old age was advancing fa&s;t upon her, tho'
&s;he had lo&s;t much of her popularity by the unfortunate

in public, &s;he was not attended with the u&s;ual accla|mations<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 602. O&s;borne, p. 60$.</NOTE>, yet the powers of her prerogative, &s;upport|ed
by her vigour, &s;till remained as high and uncon|troulable
as ever.</P>
<P>THE active reign of Elizabeth had enabled many per|&s;ons
to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in civil and military em|polyments;
and the Queen, who was not able, from
her revenue, to give them any rewards proportioned to
their &s;ervices, had made u&s;e of an expedient, which had
been employed by her predece&s;&s;ors, but which had
never been carried to &s;uch an extreme as under her ad|mini&s;tration.
She granted her &s;ervants and courtiers
patents for monopolies; and the&s;e patents they &s;old
to others, who were thereby enabled to rai&s;e commo|dities
&s;o what price they plea&s;ed, and who put invinci|ble
re&s;traints upon all commerce, indu&s;try, and emu|lation.
It is a&s;toni&s;hing to con&s;ider the number and
importance of tho&s;e commodities, which were thus a&s;|&s;igned
over to patentees. Currants, &s;alt, iron, powder,
<PB N="457" REF="514">
cards, calf-&s;kins, fells, pouldavies, ox-&s;hin-bones,
train oil, li&s;ts of cloth, pot-a&s;hes, anni&s;eeds, vinegar,
&s;ea-coals, &s;teel, aquavita, bru&s;hes, pots, bottles, &s;alt-petre,
lead, accidences, oil, calamint-&s;tone, oil of
blubber, gla&s;&s;es, paper, &s;tarch, tin, &s;ulphur, new dra|pery,
dried pilchards, tran&s;portation of iron ordnance,
of beer, of horn, of leather, importation of Spani&s;h
wools, of iri&s;h yarn: The&s;e are but a part of the com|modities,
which had been con&s;igned over to monopo|li&s;ts<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 648, 650, 652.</NOTE>. When this li&s;t was read over in the hou&s;e, a
member cried out, <HI>Is not bread in the number? Bread,</HI>
&s;aid every one with a&s;toni&s;hment: <HI>Yes, I a&s;&s;ure you,</HI>
replied he, <HI>if affairs go on at this rate, we &s;hall have bread
reduced to a monopoly before next Parliament</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 648.</NOTE>. The&s;e
monopoli&s;ts were &s;o exorbitant in their demands, that
in &s;ome places they rai&s;ed the price of &s;alt, from &s;ix|teen
pence a bu&s;hel, to fourteen or fifteen &s;hillings<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 647.</NOTE>.
Such high profits naturally begot intruders upon their
commerce; and in order to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t
encroachments, the patentees were armed with high
and arbitrary powers from the council, by which they
were enabled to oppre&s;s the people at plea&s;ure, and
to exact money from &s;uch as they thought proper to
accu&s;e of interfering with their patent<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 644, 646, 652.</NOTE>. The paten|tees
of &s;alt-petre, having the power of entering into
every hou&s;e, and of committing what havock they
plea&s;ed in &s;tables, cellars, or where-ever they &s;u&s;pected
&s;alt-petre might be gathered; commonly extorted
money from tho&s;e who de&s;ired to free them&s;elves from
this damage or trouble<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 653.</NOTE>. And while all dome&s;tic in|tercour&s;e
was thus re&s;trained, le&s;t any &s;cope &s;hould
remain for indu&s;try, almo&s;t every &s;pecies of foreign
commerce was confined to exclu&s;ive companies, who
<PB N="458" REF="515">
bought and &s;old at any price, that they them&s;elves
thought proper to offer or exact.</P>
<P>THESE grievances, the mo&s;t intolerable for the
pre&s;ent, and the mo&s;t pernicious in their con&s;equences,
that ever were known in any age or under any go|vernment,
had been mentioned in the la&s;t Parliament,
and a petition had even been pre&s;ented to the Queen,
complaining of the patents; but &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in
defending her monopoli&s;ts again&s;t her people. A bill
was now introduced into the lower hou&s;e, aboli&s;hing
all the&s;e monopolies; and as the former application
had been un&s;ucce&s;sful, a law was in&s;i&s;ted on as the
only certain expedient for correcting the&s;e abu&s;es:
The courtiers, on the other hand, maintained, that
this matter regarded the prerogative, and that the com|mons
could never hope for &s;ucce&s;s, if they did not
make application, in the mo&s;t humble and re&s;pectful
manner, to the Queen's goodne&s;s and beneficence.
The topics, which were advanced in the hou&s;e, and
which came equally from the courtiers and the country
gentlemen, and were admitted by both, will appear
the mo&s;t extraordinary to &s;uch as are prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with
an idea of the privileges enjoyed by the people during
this age, and of the liberty po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under the ad|mini&s;tration
of Elizabeth. It was a&s;&s;erted, that the
Queen inherited both an enlarging and a re&s;training
power; by her prerogative &s;he might &s;et at liberty
what was re&s;trained by &s;tatute or otherwi&s;e, and by
her prerogative &s;he might re&s;train what was otherwi&s;e
at liberty<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 644. 675.</NOTE>: That the royal prerogative was not to

even admit of any limitation<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 646, 654.</NOTE>. That ab&s;olute princes,
&s;uch as the &s;overeigns of England, were a &s;pecies of
divinity<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 649.</NOTE>. That it was in vain to attempt tying the
<PB N="459" REF="516">
Queen's hands by laws or &s;tatutes; &s;ince, by means
of her di&s;pen&s;ing power, &s;he could loo&s;en her&s;elf at her
plea&s;ure<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>: That even if a clau&s;e &s;hould be annexed

After all this di&s;cour&s;e, more worthy of a
Turki&s;h divan than of an Engli&s;h hou&s;e of commons,
according to our pre&s;ent idea of this a&s;&s;embly, the
Queen, who perceived how odious monopolies had
become, and what heats were likely to ri&s;e, &s;ent for
the &s;peaker, and de&s;ired him to inform the hou&s;e, that
&s;he would immediately cancel the mo&s;t grievous and
oppre&s;&s;ive of the&s;e patents<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be ami&s;s to &s;ubjoin &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the&s;e &s;peeches; which may &s;erve very much to give us a ju&s;t idea of the government of that age and of the political principles, which prevailed during the reign of Elizabeth. Mr. Laurence Hyde propo&s;ed a bill, entituled, an act for the explanation of the common law in certain ca&s;es of letters patent. Mr. Spicer &s;aid, This bill may touch the prerogative-royal, which, as I learned the la&s;t Parlia|ment, is &s;o tran&s;cendant, that the&mdash;of the &s;ubject may not a&s;pire there|unto. Far be it therefore from me, that the &s;tate and prerogative-royal of the prince &s;hould be tied by me, or by the act of any other &s;ubject. Mr. Francis Bacon &s;aid, As to the prerogative royal of the Prince, for my own part, I ever allowed of it; and it is &s;uch as I hope will never be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The Queen, as &s;he is our &s;overeign, hath both an enlarging and re&s;tr$ining power. For by her prerogative &s;he may &s;et at liberty things re&s;trained by &s;tatute law or otherwi&s;e, and &s;econdly by her prerogative &s;he may re&s;train things which be at liberty. For the fir&s;t, &s;he may grant a <HI>non ob&s;tante</HI> contrary to the penal laws.&mdash;With regard to monopolies and &s;uch like ca&s;es, the ca&s;e hath ever been to humble our&s;elves unto her Maje&s;ty, and by petition de&s;ire to have our grievances remedied, e&s;pecially when the remedy toucheth her &s;o nigh $word$. point of prerogative&mdash;I &s;ay, and I &s;ay it again, that we ought not to deal, to judge, or meddle with her maje&s;ty's prerogative. I wi&s;h therefore every man to be careful of this bu&s;ine&s;s. Dr. Bennet &s;aid, He that goeth about to debate her maje&s;ty's prerogative had need to walk warily. Mr. Laurence Hyde &s;aid, For the bill it&s;elf, I made it, and I think I under&s;tand it: And far be it from this heart of mine to think, this tongue to &s;peak, or this hand to write any thing either in prejudice or derogation of her maje&s;ty's prerogative-royal and the &s;tate.&mdash;Mr. Speaker, quoth &s;erjeant Harris, for ought I &s;ee, the hou&s;e moveth to have this bill in the nature of a petition. It mu&s;t then begin with more humiliation. And truly, Sir, the bill is good of it&s;elf, but the penning of it is &s;omewhat out of cour&s;e. Mr. Montague &s;aid, The matter is good and hone&s;t, and I like this manner of proceeding by bill well enough in this matter. The grievances are great, and I would note only unto you thus much, that the la&s;t Parliament we proceeded by way of petition, which had no &s;ucce&s;sful effect. Mr. Francis More &s;aid, I know the Queen's prerogative is a thing curious to be dealt withal; yet all grievances are not comparable. I cannot utter with my tongue or conceive with my heart the great grievances that the town and country, for which I &s;erve, &s;uffereth by &s;ome of the&s;e monopolies. It bringeth the ge|neral profit in$$ a private hand, and the end of all this is beggary and bondage to the &s;ubjects. We have a law for the true and faithful currying of leather: There is a patent &s;ets all at liberty, notwith&s;tanding that &s;tatute. And to what purpo&s;e is it to do any thing by act of Parliament, when the Queen will undo the &s;ame by her prerogative? Out of the &s;pirit of humiliation, Mr. Speaker, I do &s;peak it, there is no act of her's that hath been or is more derogatory to her own maje&s;ty, more odious to the &s;ubject, more dangerous to the commonwealth than the granting of the&s;e monopolies. Mr. Martin &s;aid, I do &s;peak for a town that grieves and pines, for a country that groaneth and langui&s;heth under the burthen of mon&s;trous and uncon&s;cionable &s;ub&s;titutes to the monopolitans of &s;tarch, tin, fi&s;h, cloth, oil, vinegar, &s;alt, and I know not what; nay, what not? The principale&s;t commodities both of my town and country are engro&s;t into the hands of the&s;e blood &s;uckers of the commonwealth. If a body, Mr. Speaker, being let blood, be left &s;till langui&s;hing without any remedy, how can the good e&s;tate of that body &s;till remain? Such is the &s;tate of my town and country; the traffic is taken away, the inward and private commo|dities are taken away, and dare not: be u&s;ed without the licence of the&s;e monopolitans. If the&s;e blood-&s;uckers be &s;till let alone to &s;uck up the be&s;t and principale&s;t commodities, which the earth there hath given us, what will become of us, from whom the fruits of our own &s;oil and the com|modities of our own labour, which with the &s;weat of our brows, even up to the knees in mite and dirt, we have laboured for, &s;hall be taken by warrant of &s;upreme authority, which the poor &s;ubject dare not gain&s;ay? Mr. George Moore &s;aid, We know the power of her maje&s;ty cannot be re&s;trained by any act; why therefore &s;hould we thus talk$ Admit we &s;hould make this &s;tatute with a: <HI>non ob&s;tate;</HI> yet the Queen may grant a patent with a <HI>non ob&s;tante,</HI> to cro&s;s this <HI>non ob&s;tante.</HI> I think therefore it agreeth more with the gravity and wi&s;dom of this hou&s;e to proceed with all humblene&s;s by petition than hill. Mr. Downland &s;aid, As I would be no let or over vehement in any thing, &s;o I am not fotti&s;h or &s;en&s;ele&s;s of the common grievance of the commonwealth. If we proceed by way of pe|tition, we can have no more gracious an&s;wer, than we had the la&s;t Parlia|ment to our petition. But &s;ince that Parliament, we have no reformation. Sir Robert Wroth &s;aid, I &s;peak, and I &s;peak it boldly, the&s;e patentees are wor&s;e than ever they were. Mr. Hayward Town&s;end propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould make &s;uit to her maje&s;ty, not only to repeal all monopolies grievous to the &s;ubject, but al&s;o that it would plea&s;e her maje&s;ty to give the Par|liament leave to make an act, that they might be of no more force, validity, or effect, than they are at the common law, without the &s;trength of her prerogative. Which tho' we might now do, and the act being &s;o rea&s;on|able, we might a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves her maje&s;ty would not delay the pa&s;&s;ing thereof, yet we, her loving &s;ubjects, &amp;c. would not offer without her privity and con&s;ent (the cau&s;e &s;o nearly touching her prerogative) or go about to do any &s;uch act.</P>
<P>On a &s;ub&s;equent day, the bill again&s;t monopolies was again introduced, and Mr. Spicer &s;aid, it is to no purpo&s;e to offer to tie her maje&s;ty's hands by act of parliament, when &s;he may loo&s;en her&s;elf at her plea&s;ure. Mr. Davies &s;aid, God hath given that power to ab&s;olute princes, which he at|tributes to him&s;elf. <HI>Dixi quod Dii e&s;t$s.</HI> (N. B. This axiom he applies to the Kings of England.) Mr. &s;ecretary Cecil &s;aid, I am &s;ervant to the Queen, and before I would &s;peak and give con&s;ent to a ca&s;e that &s;hould deba&s;e her prerogative, or abridge it, I would wi&s;h that my tongue were cut out of my head. I am &s;ure there were law-makers before there were laws: (Meaning, I &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;overeign was above the laws.) One gentleman went about to po&s;&s;e&s;s us, with the execution of the law in an ancient record of 5 or 7 of Edward the third. Likely enough to be true in that time, when the King was afraid of the &s;ubject. If you &s;tand upon law, and di&s;pute of the prerogative, hark ye what Bracton &s;ays, <HI>Praerogativam no&s;tram $span$ di&s;putare.</HI> And for my own part, I like not the&s;e cour&s;es &s;hould be taken. And you, Mr. Speaker, &s;hould perform the charge her maje&s;ty gave unto you, in the beginning of this Parliament, not to receive bills of this nature: For her maje&s;ty's ears be open to all grievances, and her hands &s;tretched out to every man's petitions.&mdash;When the prince di&s;pen&s;es with a penal law, that is left to the alteration of &s;overeignty, that is good and irrevocable. Mr. Montague &s;aid, I am loth to &s;peak what I know, le&s;t&punc; perhaps, I &s;hould di&s;plea&s;e. The prerogative royal is that which is now in que&s;tion, and which the laws of the land have ever allowed and main|tained. Let us therefore apply by petition to her maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>After the &s;peaker told the hou&s;e that the Queen had annulled many of the patents, Mr. Francis Moore &s;aid, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Mr. Speaker, I moved the hou&s;e both the la&s;t Parliament and this, touching this point; but I never meant (and I hope the hou&s;e thinketh &s;o) to &s;et limits and bounds to the prerogative royal. He proceeds to move, that thanks &s;hould be given to her maje&s;ty; and al&s;o, that whereas divers &s;peeches have been moved extra|vagantly in the hou&s;e, which doubtle&s;s have been told her maje&s;ty, and per|haps ill conceived of by her, Mr. Speaker would apologize, and humbly crave pardon for the &s;ame. N. B. The&s;e extracts were taken by Town&s;end, a member of the hou&s;e, who was no courtier; and the extravagance of the &s;peeches &s;eems rather to be on the other &s;ide: It will certainly appear odd to us, that this liberty &s;hould be thought extravagant. However, the Queen, notwith&s;tanding her cajoling the hou&s;e, was &s;o ill &s;atisfied with the&s;e proceedings, that &s;he &s;poke of them peevi&s;hly in her concluding &s;peech, and told them, that &s;he perceived, that private re&s;pects with them were privately ma&s;qued under public pre&s;ence. D'Ewes, p. 619.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome other topics, in favour of prerogative, &s;till more extra|vagant, advanced in the hou&s;e this parliament. When the que&s;tion of the &s;ub&s;idy was before them, Mr. &s;erjeant Heyle &s;aid, Mr. Speaker, I marvel much, that the hou&s;e &s;hould &s;tand upon granting of a &s;ub&s;idy or the time of payment, when all we have is her maje&s;ty's and &s;he may lawfully at her plea&s;ure take it from us: Yea, &s;he hath as much right to all our lands and goods as to any revenue of her crown. At which all the hou&s;e hemmed, and laughed, and talked. Well, quoth &s;erjeant Heyle, all your hemming &s;hall not put me out of countenance. So Mr. Speaker &s;tood up and &s;aid, It is a great di&s;order, that this &s;hould be u&s;ed.&mdash;So the &s;aid &s;erjeant pro|ceeded, and when he had &s;poken a little while, the hou&s;e hemmed again; and &s;o he &s;at down. In his latter &s;peech, he &s;aid, he could prove his former po&s;ition by precedents in the time of Henry the third, King John, King Stephen, &amp;c. which was the occa&s;ion of their hemming. D'Ewes, p. 633. It is ob&s;ervable, that Heyle was an eminent lawyer, a man of character. Winwood, vol. I. p. 290. And tho' the hou&s;e in general &s;hewed their di&s;approbation, no one cared to take him down, or oppo&s;e the&s;e extravagant po&s;itions. It was al&s;o a&s;&s;erted this &s;e&s;&s;ion, that in the &s;ame manner as the Roman con&s;ul was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of rejecting or admitting motions in the &s;enate, the Speaker might either admit or reject bills in the hou&s;e. D'Ewes, p. 677. The hou&s;e declared them&s;elves again&s;t this opinion; but the very propo&s;al of it is a proof at what a low ebb liberty was at that time in England.</P>
<P>In the year 1591, the judges made a &s;olemn decree, that England was an ab&s;olute empire, of which the King was the head. In con&s;equence of this opinion, they determined, that even if the act of the fir&s;t of Elizabeth had never been made, the King was &s;upreme head of the church; and might have erected, by his prerogative, &s;uch a court as the eccle&s;ia&s;tical com|mi&s;&s;ion: For that he was the head of all his &s;ubjects. Now that court was plainly arbitrary: The inference is, that his power was equally ab&s;olute over the laity. See Coke's Reports, p. 5. Caudrey's ca&s;e.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>WHEN the &s;peaker, with the other members, was in|troduced

very patiently this &s;peech, where &s;he was flattered in
phra&s;es appropriated to the Supreme Being; and &s;he
returned an an&s;wer, full of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of ten|derne&s;s
towards her people, as ought to have appeared
ful&s;ome after the late in&s;tances of rigour which &s;he had
employed, and from which nothing but nece&s;&s;ity had
made her depart. Thus was this critical affair happily
terminated; and Elizabeth, by prudently receding,
in time, from her rights, maintained her dignity, and
pre&s;erved the affections of her people.</P>
<P>THE commons granted her a &s;upply very unprece|dented,
of four &s;ub&s;idies and eight fifteenths; and they
were &s;o dutiful as to vote this &s;upply before they re|ceived

which they ju&s;tly con&s;idered as of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence

Had they attempted to extort that conce&s;&s;ion by keep|ing
the &s;upply in &s;u&s;pence; &s;o haughty was the Queen's
di&s;po&s;ition, that this appearance of con&s;traint and jea|lou&s;y

<P>THE remaining events of this reign are neither very
numerous nor important.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1602.</NOTE> The Queen, finding that
the Spaniards had involved her in &s;o much trouble, by
fomenting and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Iri&s;h rebellion, re&s;olved
to give them employment at home; and &s;he fitted out
a &s;quadron, of nine &s;hips under Sir Richard Levi&s;on,
admiral, and Sir William Mon&s;on, vice-admiral, whom
&s;he &s;ent on an expedition to the coa&s;t of Spain. The
admiral, with part of the &s;quadron, met the galleons
loaded with trea&s;ure; but was not &s;trong enough to
attack them: The vice-admiral al&s;o fell in with &s;ome

very rich &s;hips; but they e&s;caped for a like rea&s;on:
And the&s;e two brave officers, that their expedition
might not be entirely fruitle&s;s, re&s;olved to attack the
harbour of Cerimbra in Portugal, where, they received
intelligence, a very rich Carrack had taken &s;helter.
The harbour was guarded by a ca&s;tle: There were
eleven gallies &s;tationed in it: And the militia of the
country, to the number, as was believed, of twenty
thou&s;and men, appeared in arms on the &s;hore: Yet,
notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ob&s;tacles, and others derived
from the winds and tides, the Engli&s;h &s;quadron broke

built Charlemount, and many other &s;mall &s;orts, which
were impregnable to the Iri&s;h, and guarded all the
important pa&s;&s;es of the country: The activity of Sir
Henry Docwray and Sir Arthur Chiche&s;ter, permitted
no repo&s;e or &s;ecurity to the rebels: And many of the
chieftains, after &s;kulking, during &s;ome time, like wild

to cu&s;tody by Mountjoy, who intended to bring him
over captive into England, to be di&s;po&s;ed of at the
Queen's plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT Elizabeth was now incapable of receiving any
&s;atisfaction from this fortunate event:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's &s;ickne&s;s.</NOTE> She had fallen
into a profound melancholy; which all the advantages
of her high fortune, all the glories of her pro&s;perous
reign, were unable, in any degree, to alleviate or
a&s;&s;uage. Some a&s;cribed this depre&s;&s;ion of mind to her
repentance of granting a pardon to Tyrone, whom &s;he
had always re&s;olved to bring to condign puni&s;hment
for his trea&s;ons, but who had made &s;uch intere&s;t with
the mini&s;ters, as to extort a remi&s;&s;ion from her.
Others, with more likelihood, accounted for her de|jection,
by a di&s;covery which &s;he had made, of the
corre&s;pondence maintained in her court with her &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or
the King of Scots, and by the neglect to which,
on account of her old age and infirmities, &s;he imagined
her&s;elf to be expo&s;ed. But there is another cau&s;e
a&s;&s;igned for her melancholy, which has long been
rejected by hi&s;torians as romantic, but which late di&s;|coveries
&s;eem to have confirmed<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See the proofs of this remarkable fact collected in Birch's Negocia|tions, p. 206. And Memoirs, vol. II. p. 481, 505, 506, &amp;c.</NOTE>: Some incidents
happened which revived her tenderne&s;s for E&s;&s;ex, and
filled her with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow for the con&s;ent which
&s;he had unwarily given to his execution.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="524">
THE earl of E&s;&s;ex, after his return from the for|tunate
expedition again&s;t Cadiz, ob&s;erving the increa&s;e
of the Queen's fond attachment towards him, took
occa&s;ion to regret, that the nece&s;&s;ity of her &s;ervice re|quired
him often to be ab&s;ent from her per&s;on, and
expo&s;ed him to all tho&s;e ill offices which his enemies,
more a&s;&s;iduous in their attendance, could employ again&s;t
him. She was moved with this tender jealou&s;y; and
making him the pre&s;ent of a ring, de&s;ired him to keep
that pledge of her affection, and a&s;&s;ured him, that into
whatever di&s;grace he &s;hould fall, whatever prejudices
&s;he might be induced to entertain again&s;t him, yet, if
he &s;ent her that ring, &s;he would immediately upon the
&s;ight of it, recollect her former tenderne&s;s, would afford
him again a hearing, and would lend a favourable ear
to his apology. E&s;&s;ex, notwith&s;tanding all his misfor|tunes,
re&s;erved this precious gift to the la&s;t extremity;
but after his trial and condemnation, he re&s;olved to try
the experiment, and he committed the ring to the
counte&s;s of Nottingham, whom he de&s;ired to deliver
it to the Queen. The counte&s;s was prevailed on by
her hu&s;band, who was E&s;&s;ex's capital enemy, not to
execute the commi&s;&s;ion; and Elizabeth, who &s;till ex|pected
that her favourite would make this la&s;t appeal
to her tenderne&s;s, and who a&s;cribed the neglect of it
to his invincible ob&s;tinacy, was, after much delay, and
many internal combats, pu&s;hed by re&s;entment and
policy to &s;ign the warrant for his execution. The
counte&s;s of Nottingham, falling into &s;ickne&s;s, and
finding her&s;elf approach towards her end, was &s;eized
with remor&s;e for her conduct; and having obtained a
vi&s;it from the Queen, &s;he craved her pardon, and re|vealed
to her the fatal &s;ecret. The Queen, a&s;toni&s;hed
with this incident, bur&s;t into a furious pa&s;&s;ion: She
&s;hook the dying counte&s;s in her bed; and crying to her,
<PB N="468" REF="525">
<HI>That God might pardon her, but &s;he never could,</HI> &s;he broke
from her, and thenceforth re&s;igned her&s;elf over to the
deepe&s;t and mo&s;t incurable melancholy. She rejected
all con&s;olation: She even refu&s;ed food and &s;u&s;tenance:
And throwing her&s;elf on the floor, &s;he kept her&s;elf
&s;ilent and immoveable, feeding her thoughts on her
afflictions, and declaring life and exi&s;tence an in&s;uffer|able
burthen to her. Few words &s;he uttered; and
they were all expre&s;&s;ive of &s;ome inward grief which
&s;he cared not to reveal: But &s;ighs and groans were the
chief vent which &s;he gave to her de&s;pondency, and
which, tho' the di&s;covered her &s;orrows, were never
able to ea&s;e or a&s;&s;uage them. Ten days and nights
&s;he lay upon the carpet, leaning on cu&s;hions which her
maids brought her; and her phy&s;icians could not per|&s;uade
her to allow her&s;elf to be put to bed, much le&s;s
to make trial of any remedies which they pre&s;cribed to
her<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. No. 276.</NOTE>. Her anxious mind at la&s;t had &s;o long preyed
on her frail body, that her end was vi&s;ibly approach|ing;
and the council, being a&s;&s;embled, &s;ent the lord
keeper, the lord admiral, and the &s;ecretary, to know
her mind with regard to her &s;ucce&s;&s;or. She an&s;wered
with a faint voice, that as &s;he had held a regal &s;cepter,
&s;he de&s;ired no other than a royal &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Cecil re|que&s;ting
her to explain her&s;elf more particularly, &s;he
&s;ubjoined, that &s;he would have a King to &s;ucceed her;
and who &s;hould that be but her neare&s;t kin&s;man, the
King of Scots. Being then advi&s;ed by the archbi&s;hop
of Canterbury, to fix her thoughts upon God, &s;he
replied, that &s;he did &s;o, nor did her mind in the lea&s;t
wander from him. Her voice &s;oon after left her, her
&s;en&s;es failed, &s;he fell into a lethargic &s;lumber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And death</NOTE>, which
continued &s;ome hours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 March.</NOTE> and &s;he expired gently, without

farther &s;truggle or convul&s;ion, in the &s;eventieth year
of her age, and forty-fifth of her reign.</P>
<P>SUCH a dark cloud overca&s;t the evening of that day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And charac|ter.</NOTE>
which had &s;hone out with a mighty lu&s;tre in the eyes
of all Europe. There are few great per&s;onages in
hi&s;tory who have been more expo&s;ed to the calumny
of enemies, and the adulation of friends, than Queen
Elizabeth, and yet there &s;carce is any, who&s;e reputation
has been more certainly determined, by the unanimous
con&s;ent of po&s;terity. The unu&s;ual length of her ad|mini&s;tration,
and the &s;trong features of her character,
were able to overcome all prejudices; and obliging
her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and
her admirers &s;omewhat of their penegyrics, have at la&s;t,
in &s;pite of political factions, and what is more, of
religious animo&s;ities, produced an uniform judgment
with regard to her conduct. Her vigour, her con&s;tancy,
her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, addre&s;s,
are allowed to merit the highe&s;t prai&s;es, and appear not
to have been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any per&s;on who ever filled a
throne: A conduct le&s;s rigorous, le&s;s imperious, more
&s;incere, more indulgent to her people, would have been
requi&s;ite to form a perfect character. By the force of
her mind, &s;he controuled all her more active and &s;tronger
qualities, and prevented them from running into exce&s;s:
Her heroi&s;m was exempt from all temerity, her fru|gality
from avarice, her friend&s;hip from partiality,
her active temper from turbulency and a vain ambition:
She guarded not her&s;elf with equal care or equal &s;ucce&s;s
from le&s;&s;er infirmities; the rival&s;hip of beauty, the
de&s;ire of admiration, the jealou&s;y of love, and the &s;allies
of anger.</P>
<P>Her &s;ingular talents for government were founded
equally on her temper and on her capacity. Endowed
with a great command over her&s;elf, &s;he &s;oon obtained
<PB N="470" REF="527">
an uncontrouled a&s;cendant over her people; and while
&s;he merited all their e&s;teem by her real virtues, &s;he
al&s;o engaged their affection by her pretended ones.
Few &s;overeigns of England &s;ucceeded to the throne
in more difficult circum&s;tances; and none ever con|ducted
the government with &s;uch uniform &s;ucce&s;s and
felicity. Tho' unacquainted with the practice of to|leration,
the true &s;ecret for managing religious factions,
&s;he pre&s;erved her people, by her &s;uperior prudence,
from tho&s;e confu&s;ions in which theological controver&s;y
had involved all the neighbouring nations: And tho'
her enemies were the mo&s;t powerful princes of Europe,
the mo&s;t active, the mo&s;t enterprizing, the lea&s;t &s;cru|pulous,
&s;he was able by her vigour to make deep im|pre&s;&s;ions
on their &s;tate: Her own greatne&s;s mean while
remained untouched and unimpaired.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;e mini&s;ters, and brave warriors, who flou|ri&s;hed
during her reign, &s;hare the prai&s;e of her &s;ucce&s;s;
but in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening the applau&s;e due to her, they
make great addition to it. They owed, all of them,
their advancement to her choice; they were &s;upported
by her con&s;tancy; and with all their ability, they were
never able to acquire any undue a&s;cendant over her.
In her family, in her court, in her kingdom, &s;he re|mained
equally mi&s;tre&s;s: The force of the tender
pa&s;&s;ions was great over her, but the force of her mind
was &s;till &s;uperior; and the combat which her victory
vi&s;ibly co&s;t her, &s;erves only to di&s;play the firmne&s;s of
her re&s;olution, and the loftine&s;s of her ambitious &s;en|timents.</P>
<P>THE
fame of this prince&s;s, tho' it has &s;urmounted the
prejudices both of faction and of bigotry, yet lies &s;till
expo&s;ed to another prejudice, which is more durable
becau&s;e more natural, and which, according to the
different views in which we &s;urvey her, is capable
<PB N="471" REF="528">
either of exalting beyond mea&s;ure, or dimini&s;hing the
lu&s;tre of her character. This prejudice is founded on
the con&s;ideration of her &s;ex. When we contemplate
her as a woman, we are apt to be &s;truck with the
highe&s;t admiration of her great qualities and exten&s;ive
capacity; but we are al&s;o apt to require &s;ome more
&s;oftne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ome greater lenity of temper,
&s;ome of tho&s;e amiable weakne&s;&s;es by which her &s;ex is
di&s;tingui&s;hed. But the true method of e&s;timating her
merit, is to lay a&s;ide all the&s;e con&s;iderations, and con|&s;ider
her merely as a rational being, placed in autho|rity,
and entru&s;ted with the government of mankind.
We may find it difficult to reconcile our fancy to her
as a wife or a mi&s;tre&s;s; but her qualities as a &s;overeign,
tho' with &s;ome con&s;iderable exceptions, are the object
of undi&s;puted applau&s;e and approbation.</P>
<P>THE party among&s;t us who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves
by their adherence to liberty and a popular Go|vernment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government, manners, commerce, arts and learning.</NOTE>
have long indulged their prejudices again&s;t
the &s;ucceeding race of princes, by be&s;towing unbounded
panegyrics on the virtue and wi&s;dom of Elizabeth.
They have been &s;o extremely ignorant of tran&s;actions
of this reign, as to extol her for a quality which, of
all others, &s;he was the lea&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;t of; a tender regard
for the con&s;titution, and a concern for the liberties and
privileges of her people. But as it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for
the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of party to throw a veil much longer
over facts &s;o palpable and undeniable, there is danger
le&s;t the public &s;hould run into the oppo&s;ite extreme,
and &s;hould entertain an aver&s;ion to the memory of a
prince&s;s who exerci&s;ed the royal authority in a manner
&s;o contrary to all the ideas which we at pre&s;ent enter|tain
<PB N="472" REF="529">
of a legal con&s;titution. But Elizabeth only &s;up|ported
the prerogatives which were tran&s;mitted to her
by her immediate predece&s;&s;ors: She believed that her
&s;ubjects were entitled to no more liberty than their
ance&s;tors enjoyed: She found that they entirely acqui|e&s;ced
in her arbitrary admini&s;tration: And it was not
natural for her to find fault with a form of government,
by which &s;he her&s;elf was inve&s;ted with &s;uch unlimited
authority. In the particular exertions of power, the
que&s;tion ought never to be forgot, <HI>What is be&s;t?</HI> But
in the general di&s;tribution of power among the &s;everal
members of a con&s;titution, there can &s;eldom be ad|mitted
any other que&s;tion, than <HI>What is u&s;ual?</HI> Few
examples occur of princes, who have willingly re&s;igned
their power: None of tho&s;e who have, without &s;trug|gle,
allowed it to be extorted from them. If any other
rule than e&s;tabli&s;hed practice be followed, factions and
di&s;&s;en&s;ions mu&s;t multiply without end: And tho' many
con&s;titutions, and none more than the Briti&s;h, have
been improved even by violent innovations, the prai&s;e
which we be&s;tow on tho&s;e patriots, to whom we are
indebted for our privileges, ought to be given with &s;ome
re&s;erve, and &s;urely without the lea&s;t rancour again&s;t
tho&s;e who adhered to the ancient con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IN order to under&s;tand the ancient con&s;titution of
England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">By the ancient con&s;titution, is here meant that which prevailed before the &s;ettlement of our pre&s;ent plan of liberty. There was a more antient con&s;titution, where, tho' the people had perhaps le&s;s liberty than under the Tudors, yet the King had al&s;o le&s;s authority: The power of the barons was a great check upon him, and exerci&s;ed great tyra$ny over them. But there was &s;till a more antient con&s;titution, viz. that before the &s;igning of the charter, where neither the people nor the barons had any regular autho|rity; and the power of the government was almo&s;t wholly in the King. The Engli&s;h con&s;titution, like all others, has been in a &s;tate of continual fluctuation.</NOTE>, there is not a period which de&s;erves more
to be &s;tudied than the reign of Elizabeth. The pre|rogatives
<PB N="473" REF="530">
of this prince&s;s were &s;carce ever di&s;puted,
and &s;he therefore employed them without &s;cruple:
Her imperious temper, a circum&s;tance in which &s;he
went far beyond her &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, rendered her exertions
of power violent and frequent, and di&s;covered the
full extent of her authority: The great popularity
which &s;he enjoyed, proves, that &s;he did not infringe
any e&s;tabli&s;hed liberties of the people: There remain
monuments numerous enough to a&s;certain the mo&s;t
noted acts of her admini&s;tration: And tho' the&s;e mo|numents
mu&s;t be &s;ought for remote from the ordinary
hi&s;torians, they become only the more authentic on
that account, and &s;erve as a &s;tronger proof, that the
particular exertions of her power were conceived to
be nothing but the ordinary cour&s;e of admini&s;tration,
&s;ince they were not thought remarkable enough to be
recorded even by contemporary writers. If there was
any difference in this particular, the people, in former
reigns, &s;eem rather to have been more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive than
during the age of Elizabeth<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">In a memorial of the &s;tate of the realm, drawn by &s;ecretary Cecil, in 1569, there is this pa&s;&s;age. &startq;Then followeth the decay of obedience in civil policy, which being compared with the fearfulne&s;s and reverence of all inferior e&s;tates to their &s;uperiors in times pa&s;t, will a&s;toni&s;h any wi&s;e and con&s;iderate per&s;on, to behold the de&s;peration of reformation.&endq; Haynes, p. 586.

improper to recount &s;ome of the ancient prerogatives
of the crown, and lay open the &s;ources of that great
power which the Engli&s;h monarchs formerly en|joyed.</P>
<P>ONE
of the mo&s;t ancient and mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed in|&s;truments
of power was the court of Star-chamber,
which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an unlimited di&s;cretionary authority of
fining, impri&s;oning, and inflicting corporal puni&s;hment,
and who&s;e juri&s;diction extended to all &s;orts of offences,
contempts, and di&s;orders, that lay not within reach
<PB N="474" REF="531">
of the common law. The members of this court con|&s;i&s;ted
of the privy council and the judges; men, who
all of them enjoyed their offices during plea&s;ure: And
when the prince him&s;elf was pre&s;ent, he was the &s;ole
judge, and all the others could only interpo&s;e with their
advice. There needed but this one court in any govern|ment,
to put an end to all regular, legal, and exact
plans of liberty. For who dur&s;t &s;et him&s;elf in oppo|&s;ition
to the crown and mini&s;try, or a&s;pire to the
character of being a patron of freedom, while expo&s;ed
to &s;o arbitrary a juri&s;diction? I much que&s;tion, whe|ther
any of the ab&s;olute monarchies in Europe con|tain,
at pre&s;ent, &s;o illegal and de&s;potic a tribunal.</P>
<P>THE court of High Commi&s;&s;ion was another juri&s;|diction
&s;till more terrible, both becau&s;e the crime of
here&s;y, of which it took cognizance, was more unde|finable
than any civil offence, and becau&s;e its methods
of inqui&s;ition and of admini&s;tering oaths, were more
contrary to all the mo&s;t &s;imple ideas of ju&s;tice and
equity. The fines and impri&s;onments impo&s;ed by this
courts were frequent: The deprivations and &s;u&s;pen|&s;ions
of the clergy for non-conformity, were al&s;o very
numerous, and comprehended at one time the third
of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of England<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Neal, vol. I. p. 479</NOTE>. The Queen, in
a letter to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, &s;aid expre&s;s|ly,
that &s;he was re&s;olved, &startq;That no man &s;hould be
&s;uffered to decline either on the le&s;t or on the right
hand, from the drawn line limited by authority, and
by her laws and injunctions<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Murden, p. 183.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT Martial Law went far beyond even the&s;e two
courts in a prompt and arbitrary and violent method of
deci&s;ion. Whenever there was any in&s;urrection or
public di&s;order, the crown employed martial law; and
<PB N="475" REF="532">
it was, during that time, exerci&s;ed not only over the
&s;oldiers, but over the whole people: Any one might
be puni&s;hed as a rebel, or an aider and abettor of re|bellion,
whom the provo&s;t-mar&s;hal or lieutenant of
counties, or their deputies, plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;pect. Lord
Bacon &s;ays, that the trial at common law granted to the
earl of E&s;&s;ex, and his fellow con&s;pirators, was a fa|vour:
For that the ca&s;e would have born and required
the &s;everity of martial law<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vol. IV. p. 510.</NOTE>. We have &s;een in&s;tances
of its being employed by Queen Mary in defence of
orthodoxy. There remains a letter of Queen Eliza|beth's
to the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the
northern rebellion, in which &s;he reproves him &s;harply,
becau&s;e &s;he had not heard of his having done any exe|cution
by martial law<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">MS. of lord Roy&s;ton's from the Paper Office.</NOTE>; tho' it is probable, that near
eight hundred per&s;ons &s;uffered, one way or other, on
account of that &s;light in&s;urrection. But the Kings of
England did not always limit the exerci&s;e of this law
to the times of war and rebellion. In 1552, when
there was no rebellion or in&s;urrection, King Edward
granted a commi&s;&s;ion of martial law; and empowered
the commi&s;&s;ioners to execute it, <HI>as &s;hould be thought by
their di&s;cretions mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Strype's Eccle&s;. Memoirs, vol. II. p. 373, 458, 9.</NOTE>. Queen Elizabeth too
was not &s;paring in the u&s;e of this law. In 1573, one
Peter Burchet a puritan, being per&s;uaded that it was
lawful or meritorious to kill &s;uch as oppo&s;ed the truth
of the go&s;pel, ran into the &s;treets, and wounded Haw|kins,
the famous &s;ea-captain, whom he took for Hatton,
the Queen's favourite. The Queen was &s;o incen&s;ed
that &s;he ordered him to be puni&s;hed in&s;tantly by martial
law; but upon the remon&s;trance of &s;ome prudent coun|&s;ellors,
who told her, that that law ought to be confined
<PB N="476" REF="533">
to turbulent times, &s;he recalled her order, and delivered
over Burchet to the common law<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 446. Strype, vol. II. p. 288.</NOTE>. But &s;he continued
not always &s;o re&s;erved in exerting this authority. There
remains a proclamation of hers, in which &s;he orders
martial law to be u&s;ed again&s;t all &s;uch as import bulls,
or even forbidden books and pamphlets from abroad<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 570.</NOTE>;
and prohibits the lieutenants or their deputies to be
que&s;tioned for their arbitrary puni&s;hment of &s;uch of|fenders,
<HI>any law or &s;tatute to the contrary in any wi&s;e not|with&s;tanding.</HI>
We have another act of hers &s;till more
extraordinary. The &s;treets of London were very much
infe&s;ted with idle vagabonds and riotous per&s;ons: The
lord mayor had endeavoured to repre&s;s this di&s;order:
The Star-chamber had exerted its authority, and in|flicted
puni&s;hment on the&s;e riotors: But the Queen,
finding tho&s;e remedies ineffectual, revived martial law,
and gave Sir Thomas Wilford a commi&s;&s;ion of provo&s;t-mar&s;hal:
&startq;Granting him authority, and commanding
him, upon &s;ignification given by the ju&s;tices of peace
in London or the neighbouring counties, of &s;uch of|fenders,
worthy to be &s;peedily executed by martial
law, to attach and take the &s;ame per&s;ons, and in the
pre&s;ence of the &s;aid ju&s;tices, according to ju&s;tice of
martial law, to execute them upon the gallows or
gibbet openly, or near to &s;uch place where the &s;aid
rebellious and incorrigible offenders &s;hall be found
to have committed the &s;aid great offences<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 279.</NOTE>.&endq; I &s;up|po&s;e
it will be difficult to produce an in&s;tance of &s;uch
an act of authority in any place nearer than Mu&s;|covy.</P>
<P>THE
Star chamber, and High Commi&s;&s;ion, and
Court Martial, tho' arbitrary juri&s;dictions, yet had &s;till
&s;ome pretence of a trial, at lea&s;t a &s;entence; but there
<PB N="477" REF="534">
was a grievous puni&s;hment very familiarly inflicted in
that age, without any other authority than the warrant
of a &s;ecretary of &s;tate, or of the privy-council<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">In 1588, the lord mayor committed &s;everal citizens to pri&s;on, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to pay the loan demanded of them. Murden, p. 632.</NOTE>; and
that was, impri&s;onment, in any jail, and during any
time that the&s;e mini&s;ters &s;hould think proper. In &s;u&s;|picious
times, all the jails were full of pri&s;oners of &s;tate;
and the&s;e unhappy victims of public jealou&s;y were &s;ome|times
thrown into dungeons, and loaded with irons,
and treated in the mo&s;t cruel manner, without their
being able to obtain any remedy from law.</P>
<P>THIS practice was an indirect way of employing tor|ture:
But the rack it&s;elf was frequently u&s;ed, upon any
&s;u&s;picion, without other authority than a warrant from
the &s;ecretary or the privy council. Even the council
in the marches of Wales were empowered, by their
very commi&s;&s;ion, to make u&s;e of torture, whenever they
thought proper<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 196.</NOTE>. There cannot be a &s;tronger proof
how lightly the rack was employed, than the following
&s;tory, told by lord Bacon. We &s;hall give it in his
own words. &startq;The Queen was mightily incen&s;ed
again&s;t Haywarde, on account of a book he dedicated
to lord E&s;&s;ex, being a &s;tory of the fir&s;t year of
King Henry the fourth, thinking it a &s;editious pre|lude
to put into the people's heads boldne&s;s and fac|tion<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">To our apprehen&s;ion, Haywarde's Book &s;eems rather to have a contrary tendency. For he has there pre&s;erved the famous Speech of the Bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le, which contains, in the mo&s;t ex|pre&s;s terms, the Doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience. But Queen Elizabeth was very difficult to plea&s;e on this head.</NOTE>: She &s;aid, &s;he had an opinion that there was
trea&s;on in it, and a&s;ked me, if I could not find any
places in it, that might be drawn within the ca&s;e
of trea&s;on: Whereto I an&s;wered, For rea&s;on, &s;ure
I found none; but for felony, very many: And
when her maje&s;ty ha&s;tily a&s;ked me, Wherein? I told
<PB N="478" REF="535">
her, the author had committed very apparent theft:
For he had taken mo&s;t of the &s;entence of Cornelius
Tacitus, and tran&s;lated them into Engli&s;h, and
put them into his text. And another time, when
the Queen could not be per&s;uaded, that it was
his writing who&s;e name was to it, but that it had
&s;ome more mi&s;chievous author, and &s;aid with great
indignation, that &s;he would have him racked to pro|duce
his author; I replied, Nay, madam, he is a
doctor, never rack his per&s;on, but rack his &s;tile:
Let him have pen, ink, and paper, and help of books,
and be enjoined to continue the &s;tory where it break|eth
off, and I will undertake, by collating the &s;tyles,
to judge whether he were the author of no<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cabba$a, p. $1.</NOTE>.&endq;
Thus, had it not been for Bacon's humanity, or ra|ther
his wit, this author, a man of letters, had been
put to the rack, for a mo&s;t innocent performance. His
real offence was, his dedicating a book to that muni|&s;icent
patron of the learned, the earl of E&s;&s;ex, at a
time when this nobleman lay under di&s;grace with her
maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE Queen's menace of trying and puni&s;hing Hay|warde
for trea&s;on, could ea&s;ily have been executed,
let his book have been ever &s;o innocent. While &s;o
many terrors hung over the people, no jury dur&s;t have
acquitte$ $ man whom the court was re&s;olved to have
condemned. The practice al&s;o of not confronting the
witne&s;&s;es with the pri&s;oner, gave the crown lawyers
all imaginable advantages again&s;t him. And, indeed,
there &s;carce occurs an in&s;tance, during all the&s;e reigns,
that the &s;overeign, or the mini&s;ters, were ever di&s;ap|pointed
in the i&s;&s;ue of a pro&s;ecution. Timid juries,
and judges who held their offices during plea&s;ure, never
failed to &s;econd all the views of the court.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="536">
THE power of pre&s;&s;ing, and obliging any per&s;on to
accept of any office, was another prerogative totally
incompatible with freedom. O&s;borne gives the follow|ing
account of Elizabeth's method of employing this
prerogative. &startq;In ca&s;e &s;he found any likely to inter|rupt
her occa&s;ions,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;&s;he did &s;ea&s;onably
prevent him by a chargeable employment abroad,
or putting him upon &s;ome &s;ervice at home, which
&s;he knew lea&s;t grateful to the people: Contrary to
a fal&s;e maxim, &s;ince practi&s;ed with far wor&s;e &s;ucce&s;s,
by &s;uch princes as thought it better hu&s;bandry to
buy off enemies man reward friends<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Page 392.</NOTE>.&endq; The prac|tice
with which O&s;borne reproaches the two immediate
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Elizabeth, proceeded partly from the ex|treme
difficulty of their &s;ituation, partly from the
greater lenity of their di&s;po&s;ition. The power of pre&s;|&s;ing,
as may naturally be imagined, was often abu&s;ed;
and money was exacted by the officers for freeing per|&s;ons
from the &s;ervice<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Murden, p. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE government of England during that age,
however different in other particulars, bore, in this re|&s;pect,
&s;ome re&s;emblance to that of Turkey at pre&s;ent:
The &s;overeign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every power, except that of
impo&s;ing taxes: And in both countries this limitation,
un&s;upported by other privileges, appears rather pre|judicial
to the people. In Turkey, it obliges the Sul|tan
to permit the extortion of the ba&s;has and governors
of provinces, from whom he afterwards &s;queezes pre|&s;ents
or takes forfeitures: In England, it engaged the
Queen to erect monopolies, and grant patents for ex|clu&s;ive
trade: An invention &s;o pernicious, that, had
&s;he gone on, during a tract of years, at her own rate,
England, the &s;eat of riches, and arts, and commerce,

would have contained at pre&s;ent as little indu&s;try as
Morocco, or the coa&s;t of Barbary.</P>
<P>WE may further ob&s;erve, that this valuable privi|lege,
valuable only becau&s;e it proved afterwards the
means by which the Parliament extorted all their other
privileges, was very much encroached on, in an in|direct
manner, during the reign of Elizabeth, as well
as of her predece&s;&s;ors. She often exacted loans from
her people; an arbitrary and unequal kind of impo&s;ition
and which individuals felt &s;everely: For tho' the money
had been regularly re&s;tored, which was &s;eldom the
ca&s;e<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol IV. p. 362.</NOTE>, it lay in the prince's hands without intere&s;t,
which was a &s;en&s;ible lo&s;s to the individuals from whom
the money was borrowed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In the &s;econd of Richard II, it was enacted that in loans, which the King &s;hall require of his &s;ubjects, upon letters of Privy Seal, &s;uch as have <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> excu&s;e of not lending, may there be received without further &s;ummons, travel or greef. See Cotton's Abridg. p. 170. By the law, the King's Prerogative of exacting loans was ratify'd; and what ought to be deem'd a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> excu&s;e was &s;till left in his own brea&s;t, to judge of.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE remains a propo&s;al made by the lord Bur|leigh,
for levying a general loan on the people, equi|valent
to a &s;ub&s;idy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 518, 519.</NOTE>; a &s;cheme which would have laid
the burthen more equally, but which was, in different
words, nothing but a taxation, impo&s;ed without con|&s;ent
of Parliament. It is remarkable, that the &s;cheme,
thus propo&s;ed, without any vi&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity, by that
wi&s;e mini&s;ter, is the very &s;ame which Henry the eighth
attempted, and which Charles the fir&s;t, enraged by
ill u&s;age from his Parliament, and reduced to the great|e&s;t
difficulties, put afterwards in practice, to the great
di&s;content of the nation.</P>
<P>THE demand of benevolence was another invention
of that age for taxing the people. This practice was
&s;o little conceived to be irregular, that the commons,
in 1585, offered the Queen a benevolence; which &s;he
very generou&s;ly refu&s;ed, as having no occa&s;ion, at that
<PB N="481" REF="540">
time, for money<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 494.</NOTE>. Queen Mary al&s;o, by an order $word$
council, increa&s;ed the cu&s;toms in &s;ome branches; and
her &s;i&s;ter imitated the example<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. IV. p. 362.</NOTE>. There was a &s;pecies
of &s;hip money impo&s;ed at the time of the Spani&s;h in|va&s;ion.
The &s;everal ports were required to equip a
certain number of &s;hips at their own charge; and &s;uch
was the alacrity of the people for the public defence,
that &s;ome of the ports, particularly London, &s;ent double
the number demanded of them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 267.</NOTE>. When any levies
were made for Ireland, France, or the Low Countries,
the Queen obliged the counties to rai&s;e the &s;oldiers,
to arm and cloth them, and carry them to the &s;ea|ports
at their own charge. New Year's gifts were,
at that time expected from the nobility, and from the
more con&s;iderable gentry<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memor. vol. I. p. 137</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PURVEYANCE was another method of taxation, un|equal,
arbitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive. The whole kingdom
felt &s;en&s;ibly the burthen of this impo&s;ition; and it was
regarded as a great privilege which was conferred on
Oxford and Cambridge, to prohibit the purveyors from
taking any commodities within five miles of the&s;e uni|niver&s;ities.
The Queen victualled her navy by means
of this prerogative, during the fir&s;t years of her go|vernment<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 388.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WARDSHIP was the mo&s;t regular and legal of all the&s;e
impo&s;itions by prerogative. Yet was it a great badge
of &s;lavery, and oppre&s;&s;ive to the great families. When
an e&s;tate &s;ell to a female, the &s;overeign obliged her to
marry any one he plea&s;ed: Whether the heir was male
or female, the crown enjoyed the whole profit of the
rents during the minority. The giving a rich ward&s;hip
was an u&s;ual method of rewarding a courtier or fa|vourite.</P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="541">
THE inventions were endle&s;s, which arbitrary power
might employ for extorting of money, while the peo|ple
imagined that their property was &s;ecured by the
crown's being debarred from impo&s;ing taxes. Strype
has pre&s;erved a &s;peech of lord Burleigh to the Queen
and council, wherein are contained &s;ome particulars
not a little extraordinary<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Annals, vol. IV. p. 234, &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>. Burleigh propo&s;es that
&s;he &s;hould erect a court for the correction of all abu&s;es,
and &s;hould confer on the commi&s;&s;ioners a general in|qui&s;itorial
power over the whole kingdom. He &s;ets
before her eyes the example of her wi&s;e grandfather,
Henry the &s;eventh, who, by &s;uch methods, augmented
extremely his revenue; and he recommends, that this
new court &s;hould proceed, &startq;as well by the direction
and ordinary cour&s;e of the laws, as by virtue of her
maje&s;ty's &s;upreme regiment and <HI>ab&s;olute power, from
whence law proceeded.</HI>&endq; In a word, he expects from
this in&s;titution, greater acce&s;&s;ion to the royal trea&s;ure,
than Henry the eighth derived from abolition of the
abbeys, and all the forfeitures of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical re|venues.
This project of lord Burleigh needs not, I
think, any comment. A form of government mu&s;t be
very arbitrary, where a wi&s;e and good mini&s;ter could
make &s;uch a propo&s;al to the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>EMBARGOES on merchandize was another engine of
royal power, by which the Engli&s;h princes were able
to extort money from the people. We have &s;een
in&s;tances in the reign of Mary. Elizabeth, before her
coronation, i&s;&s;ued an order to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, pro|hibiting
the &s;ale of all crim&s;on &s;ilks which &s;hould be
imported, till the court was fir&s;t provided<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. I. p. 27.</NOTE>. She ex|pected,
no doubt, a good penny-worth from the mer|chants,
while they lay under this re&s;traint.</P>
<P><PB N="483" REF="542">
THE Parliament pretended to the right of enacting
laws, as well as of granting &s;ub&s;idies; but this pri|vilege
was, during that age, &s;till more in&s;ignificant
than the other. Queen Elizabeth expre&s;sly prohibited
them from meddling with &s;tate matters or eccle&s;ia&s;tical
cau&s;es; and &s;he openly &s;ent the members to pri&s;on,
who dared to tran&s;gre&s;s her imperial edict in the&s;e par|ticulars.
There pa&s;&s;ed few Parliaments, during her
reign, where there occur not in&s;tances of this arbitrary
conduct.</P>
<P>BUT the legi&s;lative power of the Parliament was a
mere fallacy, while the &s;overeign was univer&s;ally ac|knowleged
to po&s;&s;e&s;s a di&s;pen&s;ing power, by which all
the laws could be invalidated, and rendered of no
effect. The u&s;e of this power was al&s;o an indirect
method practi&s;ed for erecting monopolies. Where the
&s;tatutes laid any branch of manufacture under re&s;tric|tions,
the &s;overeign, by exempting one per&s;on from
the laws, gave him in effect the monopoly of that
commodity<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, torn. XV. p. 756. D'Ewes, p. 645</NOTE>. There was no grievance, at that time,
more univer&s;ally complained of, than the frequent di&s;|pen&s;ing
with the penal laws<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Murden, p. 325.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT in reality, the crown po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the full legi&s;la|tive
power, by means of proclamations, which might
affect any &s;ubject of the greate&s;t importance, and which
the Star-chamber took care to &s;ee more rigorou&s;ly exe|cuted
than the laws them&s;elves. The motives of the&s;e
proclamations were &s;ometimes vey frivolous and even
ridiculous. Queen Elizabeth had taken offence at the
&s;mell of woad; and &s;he i&s;&s;ued an edict prohibiting any
one to cultivate that u&s;eful plant<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Town&s;end's Journals, p. 250. Stow's Annals.</NOTE>. She was al&s;o
plea&s;ed to take offence at the long &s;words and high ruffs
then in fa&s;hion: She &s;ent about her officers, to break
<PB N="484" REF="543">
every man's &s;word, and clip every man's ruff, which
was beyond a certain length<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Town&s;end's Journals, p. 250. Stow's Annals. Strype, vol. II. p. 603.</NOTE>. This practice re|&s;embles
&s;omewhat the method employed by the great
Czar Peter, to make his &s;ubjects change their garb.</P>
<P>THE Queen's prohibition of the prophe&s;yings was
founded on a better rea&s;on; but &s;hews &s;till the unli|mited
extent of her prerogative. Two or three people
could not meet together, in order to read the &s;criptures,
and confer about religion, tho' in ever &s;o orthodox a
manner, without her permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE were many other branches of prerogative
incompatible with an exact or regular enjoyment of
liberty. None of the nobility could marry without
permi&s;&s;ion from the &s;overeign. The Queen detained
the earl of Southampton long in pri&s;on, becau&s;e he
privately married the earl of E&s;&s;ex's cou&s;in<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. II. p. 422.</NOTE>. No
man could travel without the con&s;ent of the prince.
Sir William Evers underwent a &s;evere per&s;ecution, be|cau&s;e
he had pre&s;umed to pay a private vi&s;it to the King
of Scots<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 511.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament in the thirteenth of the Queen
prai&s;ed her for not imitating the practice, u&s;ual among
her predece&s;&s;ors, of &s;topping the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice by
particular warrants<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 141.</NOTE>. There could not po&s;&s;ibly be a
greater abu&s;e, nor a &s;tronger mark of arbitrary power;
and the Queen, in refraining from it, was very lauda|ble.
But &s;he was by no means con&s;tant in this re&s;erve.
There remain in the public records &s;ome warrants of
her's for exempting per&s;ons from all law-&s;uits and pro|&s;ecutions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 652, 708, 777.</NOTE>; and the&s;e warrants, &s;he &s;ays, &s;he grants
from her royal prerogative, which &s;he will not allow
to be di&s;puted.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="544">
IT was very u&s;ual in Queen Elizabeth's reign,
and probably in all the preceding reigns, for noblemen
or privy coun&s;ellors to commit to pri&s;on any one,
who had happened to di&s;plea&s;e them by &s;uing for his
ju&s;t debts; and the per&s;on, tho' he gained his cau&s;e
in the courts of ju&s;tice, was commonly obliged to re|linqui&s;h
his property in order to obtain his liberty.
Some likewi&s;e, who had been delivered from pri&s;on
by the judges, have again been committed to cu&s;tody
in &s;ecret places without any po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining
relief; and even the officers and &s;erjeants of the
courts of law have been puni&s;hed for executing the
writs in favour of the&s;e per&s;ons. Nay, it was u&s;ual
to &s;end for people by pur&s;uivants, a kind of harpies,
who then attended the orders of the council and high
commi&s;&s;ion; and they were brought up to London,
and con&s;trained by impri&s;onment, not only to with|draw
their lawful &s;uits, but al&s;o to pay the pur&s;uivants
great &s;ums of money. The judges, in the 34th of
the Queen, complain to her maje&s;ty of the frequency
of this practice. It is probable, that that tyranny was
carried no further down than the reign of Elizabeth;
&s;ince the Parliament, who obtained the petition of
right, found no later in&s;tances of it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;hworth, Vol. I. p. 511. Franklyn's Annals, p, 250, 251.</NOTE>. And even
the&s;e very judges of Elizabeth, who thus protect the
people again&s;t the tyranny of the great, expre&s;sly
allow, that a per&s;on committed by &s;pecial command
from the Queen, is not baileable.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to imagine, that, in &s;uch a government,
no ju&s;tice could, by cour&s;e of law, be obtained of the
&s;overeign, unle&s;s he was willing to allow it. In the
naval expedition, undertaken by Raleigh and Forbi&s;her
again&s;t the Spaniards, in 1592, a very rich carrack
was taken worth two hundred thou&s;and pounds. The
<PB N="486" REF="545">
Queen's &s;hare in the adventure was only a tenth part;
but as the prize was &s;o great, and exceeded &s;o much
the expectations of all the adventurers, &s;he was deter|mined
not to re&s;t contented with her &s;hare. Raleigh,
humbly and earne&s;tly begged her to accept of an hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds, in lieu of all demands, or ra|ther
exactions; and &s;ays, that the pre&s;ent, which the
proprietors were willing to make her of eighty thou|&s;and
pounds, was the greate&s;t that ever a prince re|ceived
from a &s;ubject<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 128, 129.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT it is no wonder the Queen, in her admini&s;tra|tion,
&s;hould pay &s;o little regard to liberty; while the
parliament it&s;elf, in enacting laws, were &s;o entirely
negligent of it. The per&s;ecuting &s;tatutes, which they
pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t papi&s;ts and puritans, are extremely con|trary
to the genius of freedom; and by expo&s;ing &s;uch
multitudes to the tyranny of prie&s;ts and bigots, accu|&s;tomed
the people to the mo&s;t di&s;graceful &s;ubjection.
Their conferring an unlimited &s;upremacy on the Queen,
or what is wor&s;e, acknowleging her inherent right to
it, was another proof of their voluntary &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>THE law of the 23d of her reign, making &s;editious
words again&s;t the Queen capital, is al&s;o a very tyran|nical
&s;tatute; and an u&s;e, no le&s;s tyrannical, was &s;ome|times
made of it. The ca&s;e of Udal, a puritanical
clergymany &s;eems &s;ingular, even in tho&s;e arbitrary
times. This man had publi&s;hed a book called a de|mon&s;tration
of di&s;cipline, in which he inveighed again&s;t
the government of bi&s;hops; and tho' he had carefully
endeavoured to conceal his name, he was thrown into
pri&s;on upon &s;u&s;picion, and brought to his trial for this
offence. It was pretended, that the bi&s;hops were part
of the Queen's political body; and to &s;peak again&s;t
<PB N="487" REF="546">
them, was really to attack her, and was therefore
felony by the &s;tatute. This was not the only iniquity,
to which Udal was expo&s;ed. The judges would not
allow the jury to determine any thing but the fact,
whether Udal had wrote the book, or not, without
examining his intention, or the import of the words.
In order to prove the fact, the crown lawyers did not
produce a &s;ingle witne&s;s to the court: They only read
the te&s;timony of two per&s;ons ab&s;ent, one of whom &s;aid
that Udal had told him he was the author; another,
that a friend of Udal's had &s;aid &s;o. They would not
allow Udal to produce any exculpatory evidence;
which, they &s;aid, was never to be permitted again&s;t the
Queen. And they tendered him an oath, by which
he was required to &s;wear, that he was not author of
the book; and his refu&s;al to give that te&s;timony was
employed as the &s;tronge&s;t proof of his guilt. It is
almo&s;t needle&s;s to add, that, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e
multiplied iniquities, a verdict of death was given by the
jury again&s;t Udal: For as the Queen was extremely
bent upon his pro&s;ecution, it was impo&s;&s;ible he could
e&s;cape<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. I. p. 144. Strype, vol. IV. p. 21. Id. Life of Whitgift, p. 343.</NOTE>. He died in pri&s;on before the execution of the
&s;entence.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of Penry was, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till harder.
This man was a zealous puritan, or rather, a Browni&s;t;
and he had wrote again&s;t the hierarchy &s;everal tracts,
&s;uch as Martin Mar-prelate, <HI>The&s;es Martinianae,</HI> and
other compo&s;itions full of low &s;currility and petulant
&s;atyre. After concealing him&s;elf for &s;ome years, he
was &s;eized; and $s the &s;tatute again&s;t &s;editious words
required that the criminal &s;hould be tried within a
year after committing the offence, he could not be in|dicted
for his printed books. He was therefore tried
<PB N="488" REF="547">
for &s;ome papers found in his pocket, as if he had thereby
&s;cattered &s;edition<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Whitgift, book IV. chap. II. Neal, vol. I. p. 564.</NOTE>. It was al&s;o imputed to him, by
the lord keeper, Puckering, that in &s;ome of the&s;e papers,
&startq;he had only acknowleged her maje&s;ty's royal power
to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> laws, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil; but had
avoided the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> terms of <HI>making, enacting, decreeing,
and ordaining</HI> laws: Which imply,&endq; &s;ays the lord
keeper, &startq;a mo&s;t ab&s;olute authority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 177.</NOTE>.&endq; Penry for
the&s;e offences was condemned and executed.</P>
<P>THUS we have &s;een, that <HI>the mo&s;t ab&s;olute</HI> authority
of the &s;overeign, to make u&s;e of the lord keeper's phra&s;e,
was e&s;tabli&s;hed on above twenty branches of preroga|tive,
which are now aboli&s;hed, and which were, every
one of them, totally incompatible with the liberty of
the &s;ubject. But what en&s;ured more effectually the
&s;lavery of the people, than even the&s;e branches of pre|rogative,
was, the e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of the times,
which attributed to the prince &s;uch an unlimited and
indefeizable power, as was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the origin
of all law, and could be bounded and circum&s;cribed by
none. The homilies, publi&s;hed for the u&s;e of the
clergy, and which they were enjoined to read every
Sunday in all the churches, inculcate every where a
blind, and unlimited pa&s;&s;ive-obedience to the prince,
which, on no account, and under no pretence, is it
ever lawful for them, in the &s;malle&s;t article, to depart
from or infringe. Much noi&s;e has been made, becau&s;e
&s;ome court chaplains, during the &s;ucceeding reigns,
were permitted to preach &s;uch doctrines; but there is
a great difference between the&s;e &s;ermons, and di&s;cour&s;es
publi&s;hed by authority, avowed by the prince and
council, and promulgated to the whole nation<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gifford, a clergyman, was &s;u&s;pended in 1584, for preaching up a limited obedience to the civil magi&s;trate. Neal, vol. I. p. 435.</NOTE>. So
<PB N="489" REF="548">
thoroughly were the&s;e principles imbibed by the people
during the reigns of Elizabeth and her immediate pre|dece&s;&s;ors,
that oppo&s;ition to them was regarded as the
mo&s;t flagrant &s;edition, and was not even rewarded by
that public prai&s;e and approbation, which can alone &s;up|port
men under &s;uch dangers and difficulties, as attend
the re&s;i&s;tance of tyrannical authority. It was only
during the next generation that the noble principles of
liberty took root, and &s;preading them&s;elves, under the
&s;helter of puritanical ab&s;urdities, became fa&s;hionable
among the people.</P>
<P>IT is worth remarking, that the advantage, u&s;ually
a&s;cribed to ab&s;olute monarchy, a greater regularity of
police and a more &s;trict execution of the laws, did
not attend the former Engli&s;h government, tho' in
many re&s;pects it fell under that denomination: A de|mon&s;tration
of this truth is contained in a judicious
paper, which is pre&s;erved by Strype<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Annals, vol. IV. p. 290.</NOTE>; and which was
wrote by an eminent ju&s;tice of peace of Somer&s;et&s;hire,
in the year 1596, near the end of the Queen's reign,
when the authority of that prince&s;s may be &s;uppo&s;ed to
be fully corroborated, by time, and her maxims of go|vernment
improved by long practice. This paper con|tains
an account of the di&s;orders which then prevailed
in the county of Somer&s;et. The author &s;ays, that
forty per&s;ons had been there executed in a year for
robberies, thefts, and other felonies; thirty-five burnt
in the hand, thirty-&s;even whipt, one hundred and
eighty-three di&s;charged: That tho&s;e who were di&s;|charged
were mo&s;t wicked and de&s;perate per&s;ons, who
never could come to any good, becau&s;e they would not
work, and none would take them into &s;ervice: That
notwith&s;tanding this great number of indictments, the
<PB N="490" REF="549">
fifth part of the felonies committed in the county
were not brought to a trial, the greater number e&s;caped
cen&s;ure, either from the &s;uperior cunning of the felons,
the remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of the magi&s;trates, or the fooli&s;h lenity
of the people: That the rapines committed by the in|finite
number of wicked, wandering, idle people were
intolerable to the poor countrymen, and obliged them
to a perpetual watch of their &s;heep-folds, their pa&s;tures,
their woods and their corn-fields: That the other
counties of England were in no better condition than
Somer&s;et&s;hire; and many of them were even in a wor&s;e:
That there were at lea&s;t three or four hundred able|bodied
vagabonds in every county, who lived by theft
and rapine; and who &s;ometimes met in troops to the
number of &s;ixty, and committed &s;poil on the inhabi|tants:
That if all the felons of this kind were a&s;&s;em|bled,
they would be able, if reduced to good &s;ubjection, to
give the greate&s;t enemy her maje&s;ty has a &s;trong battle:
And that the magi&s;trates them&s;elves were intimidated
from executing ju&s;tice upon them; and there were ex|amples
of ju&s;tices of peace, who, after giving &s;entence
again&s;t rogues, had interpo&s;ed to &s;top the execution of
their own &s;entence on account of the danger, which
hung over them from the confederates of the&s;e
felons.</P>
<P>IN the year 1575, the Queen complained in Parlia|ment
of the bad execution of the laws; and threatened,
if the magi&s;trates were not, for the future, more vigil|ant,
that &s;he would entru&s;t authority to indigent and
needy per&s;ons, who would find an intere&s;t in the
more exact di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 234.</NOTE>. It appears, that
&s;he was as good as her word. For in 1601, there
were great complaints made in Parliament of the ra|pine
of ju&s;tices of peace; and a member &s;aid, that this
<PB N="491" REF="550">
magi&s;trate was an animal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLVI.</NOTE> who, for half a dozen
of chickens, would di&s;pen&s;e with a dozen of penal
&s;tatutes<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 661&mdash;664.</NOTE>. It is not ea&s;y to account for this relaxation
of government, and neglect of police, during a reign
of &s;o much vigour as that of Elizabeth. The &s;mall
revenue of the crown is the mo&s;t likely cau&s;e that can
be a&s;&s;igned. The Queen had it not in her power to
intere&s;t a great number in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her to execute the
laws.</P>
<P>ON the whole, the Engli&s;h have no rea&s;on, from
the example of their ance&s;tors, to be in love with the
picture of ab&s;olute monarchy; or to prefer the un|limited
authority of the prince, and his unbounded
prerogatives, to that noble liberty, that &s;weet equality,
and that happy &s;ecurity, by which they are at pre&s;ent
di&s;tingui&s;hed above all nations of the univer&s;e. The
utmo&s;t that can be &s;aid in favour of the government of
that age (and perhaps it may be &s;aid with truth) is,
that the power of the prince, tho' really unlimited,
was exerci&s;ed after the European manner, and entered
not into every part of the admini&s;tration; that the in|&s;tances
of a high exerted prerogative were not &s;o fre|quent
as to render property &s;en&s;ibly in&s;ecure, or reduce
the people to a total &s;ervitude; that the freedom from
faction, the quickne&s;s of execution, and the promp|titude
of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which could be taken for
offence, or defence, made &s;ome compen&s;ation for the
want of a legal and determined liberty; that as the
prince commanded no mercenary army, there was a
tacit check on him, which maintained the government
in that medium, to which the people had been ac|cu&s;tomed;
and that this &s;ituation of England was in
reality more remote from, tho' &s;eemingly it approached
nearer to, a de&s;potic and ea&s;tern monarchy, than the

pre&s;ent government, of that kingdom, where the

<P>WE &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter with a brief account of
the revenues, the military force, the commerce, the
arts, and the learning of England during this
period.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth's oeconomy was very remarkable;
and in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;eemed to border on avarice.
The &s;malle&s;t expence, if it could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aved, ap|peared
con&s;iderable in her eyes; and even the charge
of an expre&s;s, during the mo&s;t delicate tran&s;actions,
was not below her notice<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Birch's Negot. p. 21.</NOTE>. She was al&s;o attentive to
every profit; and embraced opportunities of gain,
which may appear &s;omewhat extraordinary. She kept
the &s;ee of Ely vacant nineteen years, in order to pocket
the revenue<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 351.</NOTE>; and it was u&s;ual with her, when &s;he
promoted a bi&s;hop, to take the opportunity of pillag|ing
the &s;ee of &s;ome of its manors<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 215.</NOTE>. But that there
was in reality little or no avarice in the Queen's temper
appears from this circum&s;tance, that &s;he never ama&s;&s;ed
any trea&s;ure; and even re$u&s;ed &s;ub&s;idies from the
Parliament, when &s;he had no pre&s;ent occa&s;ion for them.
Yet we mu&s;t not conclude from this circum&s;tance, that
her oeconomy proceeded from a tender concern for her
people: She loaded them with monopolies and exclu|&s;ive
patents, which are infinitely more oppre&s;&s;ive than
the mo&s;t heavy taxes, levied in a legal and regular
manner. The real &s;ource of her frugal conduct was
derived from her de&s;ire of independency, and her care
to pre&s;erve her dignity, which would have been en|dangered,
had &s;he reduced her&s;elf to the nece&s;&s;ity of
having frequent recour&s;e to parliamentary &s;upplies.
In con&s;equence of this motive, the Queen, tho' en|gaged
<PB N="493" REF="554">
in &s;ucce&s;sful and nece&s;&s;ary wars, thought it more
prudent to make a continual dilapidation of the royal
deme&s;nes<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 141. D'Ewes, p. 151, 457, 525, 629. Bacon, vol. IV. p. 363.</NOTE>, than demand the mo&s;t moderate &s;upplies
from the commons. As &s;he lived unmarried and had
no po&s;terity, &s;he was contented to &s;erve her pre&s;ent

indigence.</P>
<P>THE &s;plendor of a court was, during this age, a
great part of the public charge; and as Elizabeth was
a &s;ingle woman, and expen&s;ive in no kind of magnifi|cence,
except cloaths, this circum&s;tance enabled her
to perform great things by her narrow revenue. She
is &s;aid to have paid four millions of debt, left on the
crown by her father, brother, and &s;i&s;ter; and incredible
&s;um for that age<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 473. I think it impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile this account of the public debts with that given by Strype, Eccle&s;. Mem. vol.

tho&s;e &s;ums, which &s;he had &s;o generou&s;ly advanced him,
during his greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es. One payment of twenty

This improvement of the revenue was owing to the
&s;ugge&s;tions of one Caermarden; and was extremely
oppo&s;ed by Burleigh, Leice&s;ter, and Wal&s;ingham. But
the Queen's per&s;everance overcame all their oppo&s;ition.
The great undertakings, which &s;he ex$$uted with &s;o
narrow a revenue, and with &s;uch &s;mall &s;upplies from
her people, prove the mighty effects of wi&s;dom and
<PB N="495" REF="556">
oeconomy. She received from the Parliament, during
the cour&s;e of her whole reign, only twenty &s;ub&s;idies
and thirty-nine fifteenths. It is not ea&s;y to compute
exactly the amount of the&s;e &s;upplies; becau&s;e the value
of a &s;ub&s;idy was continually falling; and in the end of
of her reign it amounted only to eighty thou&s;and
pounds<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 630.</NOTE>, tho' in the beginning it had been an hundred
and twenty thou&s;and. If we &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;upplies
granted Elizabeth during a reign of forty-five years
amounted to three millions, we &s;hall not probably be
much wide of the truth<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Lord Sali&s;bury computed them at two millions eight hundred thou&s;and pounds. Journ. 17. February 1609.

&s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix pounds a
year; and it is &s;urprizing, that while the Queen's de|mands
were &s;o moderate, and her expences &s;o well re|gulated,
&s;he &s;hould ever have found any difficulty of
getting a &s;upply from the Parliament, or be reduced
to make &s;ale of the crown-lands. But &s;uch was the
extreme, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, ab&s;urd par&s;imony of the Par|liaments
during that period. They valued nothing in
compari&s;on of their money: The members had no
connexion with the court; and the very idea, which
they conceived of the tru&s;t committed to them, was,
to reduce the demands of the crown, and to grant as
few &s;upplies as po&s;&s;ible. The crown, on the other
hand, conceived the Parliament in no other light than
a means of &s;upply. Queen Elizabeth made a merit
to her people of &s;eldom a&s;&s;embling Parliaments<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 124.</NOTE>. No
redre&s;s of grievances was expected from the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies:
They were &s;uppo&s;ed to meet for no other purpo&s;e than
to impo&s;e taxes.</P>

BEFORE Queen Elizabeth's reign, the Engli&s;h prin|ces
had u&s;ually recour&s;e to the city of Antwerp for vo|luntary
loans; and their credit was &s;o low, that, be|&s;ides
the exorbitant intere&s;t of ten or twelve per cent,
they were obliged to make the city of London join in
the &s;ecurity. Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham, that great and
enterprizing merchant, one of the chief ornaments of
this reign, engaged the company of merchant-adven|turers
to grant a loan to the Queen; and as the money
was regularly paid, her credit by degrees e&s;tabli&s;hed
it&s;elf in the city, and &s;he &s;hook off this dependance
on foreigners<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stowe's Survey of London, book I. p. 286.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In 1559, the Queen employed Gre&s;ham to borrow
for her two hundred thou&s;and pounds at Antwerp, in
order to enable her to reform the coinage, which was at
that time extremely deba&s;ed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MS. of lord Roy&s;ton's from the paper office, p. 295.</NOTE>. She was &s;o unpolitic
as to make her&s;elf an innovation in the coin; by di|viding
a pound of &s;ilver into &s;ixty-two &s;hillings, in|&s;tead
of &s;ixty, the former &s;tandard. This is the
la&s;t time, that the coin has been tampered with in
England.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth, &s;en&s;ible how much the defence
of her kingdom depended on its naval power, was de|&s;irous
to encourage commerce and navigation: But as
her monopolies tended to extingui&s;h all dome&s;tic indu|&s;try,
which is much more valuable than foreign trade,
and is the foundation of it, the general train of her
conduct was very ill calculated to &s;erve the purpo&s;e at
which &s;he aimed, much le&s;s to promote the riches of
her people. The exclu&s;ive companies al&s;o were an
immediate check on foreign trade. Yet, notwith&s;tand|ing
the&s;e di&s;couragements, the &s;pirit of the age was
&s;trongly bent on naval enterprizes; and be&s;ides, the
military expeditions again&s;t the Spaniards, many at|tempts
<PB N="497" REF="558">
were made for new di&s;coveries, and many new
branches of foreign commerce were opened by the
Engli&s;h. Sir Martin Forbi&s;her undertook three fruit|le&s;s
voyages to di&s;cover the north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age: Davis,
not di&s;heartened by this ill &s;ucce&s;s, made a new attempt,
when he di&s;covered the &s;traits, which pa&s;s by his name.
In 1600, the Queen granted the fir&s;t patent to the
Ea&s;t Indian company: The &s;tock of that company was
&s;eventy-two thou&s;and pounds; and they fitted out four
&s;hips, under the command of James Lanca&s;ter, for this
new branch of trade. The adventure was &s;ucce&s;sful;
and the &s;hips, returning with a rich cargo, encouraged
the company to continue that commerce.</P>
<P>THE communication with Mu&s;covy had been opened
in Queen Mary's time by the di&s;covry of the pa&s;&s;age
to Archangel: But the commerce to that country did
not begin to be carried to a great extent till about
the year 1569. The Queen obtained from the Czar
an exclu&s;ive patent to the Engli&s;h for the whole trade
to Mu&s;covy<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 408.</NOTE>; and &s;he entered into a per&s;onal, as well
as national, alliance with him. This Czar was named
John Ba&s;ilides, a mo&s;t furious tyrant, who &s;u&s;pecting
continually the revolt of his &s;ubjects, &s;tipulated to have
a &s;afe retreat and protection in England. In order the
better to en&s;ure him&s;elf of this re&s;ource, he propo&s;ed
to marry an Engli&s;h woman, and the Queen intended
to have &s;ent him the lady Anne Ha&s;tings, daughter
to the earl of Huntingdon: But when the lady was
informed of the barbarous manners of the country,
&s;he wi&s;ely declined purcha&s;ing an empire at the expence
of her ea&s;e and &s;afety<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 493.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h, encouraged by the privileges, which
they had obtained from Ba&s;ilides, ventured farther
into the&s;e countries, than any Europeans had formerly
<PB N="498" REF="559">
done. They tran&s;ported their goods along the river
Dwina in boats made of one entire tree, which they
towed and rowed up the &s;tream as far as Walogda.
From thence, they carried them &s;even days journey by
land to Yera&s;lau, and then down the Volga to A&s;tra|can.
At A&s;tracan, they built &s;hips, cro&s;&s;ed the Ca&s;pian
Sea, and di&s;tributed their commodities into Per&s;ia.
But this bold attempt met with &s;uch di&s;couragements
that it was never renewed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 418.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of John Ba&s;ilides, his &s;on Theo|dore
revoked the patent, which the Engli&s;h enjoyed
for a monopoly of the Ru&s;&s;ian trade; and when the
Queen remon&s;trated again&s;t this innovation, he told,
her mini&s;ters, that princes mu&s;t carry an indifferent
hand, as well between their &s;ubjects as between fo|reigners;
and not convert trade, which by the laws
of nations ought to be common to all, into a mono|poly
for the private gain of a few<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 493.</NOTE>. So much ju&s;ter
notions of commerce were entertained by this barba|rian,
than were practi&s;ed by the renowned Queen
Elizabeth! Theodore, however, continued &s;ome pri|vileges
to the Engli&s;h, on account of their being the
fir&s;t di&s;coverers of the communication between Europe
and his country.</P>
<P>THE trade to Turkey was begun about 1583;
and that commerce was immediately confined to a
company by Queen Elizabeth. Before that time, the
grand &s;ignior had always conceived England to be a
dependant province of France<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Birch's Memoirs, vol. I. p. 36.</NOTE>; but having heard
of the Queen's power and reputation he gave a good
reception to the Engli&s;h, and even granted them larger
privileges than he had given to the French.</P>
<P><PB N="499" REF="560">
THE merchants of the Han&s;e-towns complained
loudly in the beginning of Elizabeth's reign of the treat|ment,
which they had received in the days of King
Edward and Queen Mary. She very prudently replied,
that as &s;he would not innovate any thing, &s;he would
protect them &s;till in the immunities and privileges, which
&s;he found them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. This an&s;wer not con|tenting
them, their commerce was &s;oon after &s;u&s;pended
for a time, to the great advantage of the Engli&s;h mer|chants,
who tried what they could them&s;elves effectu|ate
for the promotion of their own indu&s;try. They
took the whole trade into in their own hands: and
their returns proving &s;ucce&s;sful, they divided them&s;elves
into &s;taplers and merchant-adventurers; the former
re&s;iding con&s;tantly at one place, the other trying their
fortunes in other towns and &s;tates abroad with cloth
and other manufactures. This &s;ucce&s;s &s;o enraged the
Han&s;e-towns, that they tried all the methods, which
a di&s;contented people could devi&s;e, to draw upon the
Engli&s;h merchants the ill opinion of other nations
and &s;tates. They prevailed &s;o far as to obtain an im|perial
edict, by which the Engli&s;h merchants were pro|hibited
all commerce in the empire: The Queen, by
way of retaliation, retained &s;ixty of their &s;hips, which
had been &s;eized in the river of Li&s;bon with contraband
goods of the Spaniards. The&s;e &s;hips the Queen in|tended
to have re&s;tored, as de&s;iring to have compromi&s;ed
all differences with tho&s;e trading cities; but when
&s;he was informed, that a general a&s;&s;embly was held
at Lubec, in order to concert mea&s;ures for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing
the Engli&s;h trade, &s;he cau&s;ed the &s;hips and cargoes
to be confi&s;cated; only two of them were relea&s;ed to
carry home the news, and to inform the&s;e &s;tates, that
&s;he had the greate&s;t contempt imaginable for all their
proceedings<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. I. p. 470.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="500" REF="561">
HENRY the eighth, in order to fit out a navy, was
obliged to hire &s;hips from Hamburg, Lubec, Dantzick,
Genoa, and Venice: But Elizabeth, very early in
her reign, put affairs upon a better footing; both by
building &s;ome &s;hips of her own, and by encouraging
the merchants to build large trading ve&s;&s;els, which,
on occa&s;ion, were converted into &s;hips of war<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 388.</NOTE>. In
1582, the &s;eamen in England were computed at four|teen
thou&s;and two hundred and ninety-five men<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 256.</NOTE>;
the number of ve&s;&s;els twelve hundred and thirty-two;
of which there were only two hundred and &s;eventeen
above eighty tons. Mon&s;on computes, that tho' the
navigation decayed in the fir&s;t years of James the fir&s;t,
by the practice of the merchants, who carried on their
trade in foreign bottoms<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 300.</NOTE>, yet before 1640, this num|ber
of &s;eamen was trebled in England<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 210, 256.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE navy which the Queen left at her decea&s;e ap|pears
con&s;iderable, when we reflect only on the num|ber
of ve&s;&s;els, which were forty-two: But when we
con&s;ider that none of the&s;e &s;hips carried above forty
guns; that four only came up to that number; that
there were but two &s;hips of a thou&s;and ton; and
twenty-three below five hundred, &s;ome of fifty, and
&s;ome even of twenty tons; that the whole number of
the guns belonging to the fleet were &s;even hundred and
&s;eventy-four<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;on, p. 196. The Engli&s;h navy at pre&s;ent carries about 14000 guns.</NOTE>; we mu&s;t entertain a very contemptible
idea of the Engli&s;h navy compared to the force which
it has now attained. In the year 1588, there were
not above five ve&s;&s;els, equipped by the noblemen and
&s;ea-ports, which exceeded two hundred tons<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 300.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN 1599, an alarm was given of an inva&s;ion from
the Spaniards; and the Queen equipped a fleet and
<PB N="501" REF="562">
levied an army in a fortnight to oppo&s;e them. Nothing
gave foreigners a higher idea of the power of England
than this &s;udden armament. In 1575, all the militia
in the kingdom were computed at an hundred and
eighty-two thou&s;and nine hundred and twenty-nine<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. I. p. 432.</NOTE>.
A di&s;tribution was made, in 1595, of an hundred
and forty thou&s;and men, be&s;ides tho&s;e which Wales
could &s;upply<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. IV. p. 221.</NOTE>. The&s;e armies were formidable by their
numbers; but their di&s;cipline and experience were not
proportional. Small bodies from Dunkirk and New|port
frequently ran over, and plundered the ea&s;t coa&s;t:
So unfit was the militia, as it was then con&s;tituted, for
the defence of the kingdom. The lord lieutenants
were fir&s;t appointed to the counties in this reign.</P>
<P>MR. MURDEN<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">p. 608.</NOTE> has publi&s;hed a paper, which con|tains
the military force of the nation at the time of
the Spani&s;h Armada, and which is &s;omewhat different
from the account given by our ordinary hi&s;torians. It
makes all the able-bodied men of the kingdom amount
to an hundred and eleven thou&s;and five hundred and
thirteen; tho&s;e armed, to eighty thou&s;and eight hun|dred
and &s;eventy-five; of whom forty four thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and twenty-&s;even were trained. It mu&s;t
be &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e able-bodied men con&s;i&s;ted of
&s;uch only as were regi&s;tered, otherwi&s;e the &s;mall num|ber

the &s;ame time, together with Popham, Lord Chief
Ju&s;tice, to take a &s;urvey of all the people of England,
and that they found them to be 900,000 of all &s;orts.
This number, by the ordinary rules of computation,
&s;uppo&s;es, that there were above 200,000 men able to
bear arms. Yet even this number is &s;urprizingly &s;mall.
<PB N="502" REF="563">
Can we &s;uppo&s;e thus the kingdom is &s;even times more
populous at pre&s;ent? And that Murden's was the real
number of men, excluding catholics and infirm per|&s;ons?</P>
<P>WHATEVER opinion we may form of the compara|tive
populou&s;ne&s;s of England in the&s;e two periods, it
mu&s;t be allowed, that there is a prodigious encrea&s;e of
power, in that, more perhaps than in any other Euro|pean
&s;tate, &s;ince the beginning of the la&s;t century.
It would be no paradox to affirm, that Ireland alone
could at pre&s;ent exert a greater force than all the three
kingdoms were capable of at the death of Queen
Elizabeth. And we might go farther, and a&s;&s;ert, that
one good county of England is capable of making, at
lea&s;t of &s;upporting, a greater effort than the whole
kingdom was in the reign of Harry V; when the main|tainance
of a garri&s;on in a &s;mall town, like Calais,
formed more than a third of the ordinary national ex|pence.
Such are the effects of liberty, indu&s;try, and
good government!</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of the Engli&s;h manufactures was at this
time very low, and foreign wares of almo&s;t all kinds
had the preference<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">D'Ewes, p. 505.</NOTE>. About 1590, there were in
London four per&s;ons only rated in the &s;ub&s;idy-books &s;o
high as four hundred pounds<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 497.</NOTE>. This computation is
not indeed to be deemed an exact e&s;timate of their
wealth. In 1567, there were found on enquiry to be
four thou&s;and eight hundred and fifty-one &s;trangers of
all nations in London: Of whom three thou&s;and eight
hundred and thirty-eight were Flemings, and only fifty|eight
Scots<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 461, 462.</NOTE>. The per&s;ecutions in France and the
Low Countries drove after wards a greater number of
foreigners into England; and the commerce, as well
<PB N="503" REF="564">
as manufactures, of the kingdom was very much im|proved
by them<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 668.</NOTE>. It was then that Sir Thomas
Gre&s;ham built, at his own charge, the magnificent
fabric of the Exchange for the reception of the mer|chants:
The Queen vi&s;ited it, and gave it the appella|tion
of the Royal Exchange.</P>
<P>THERE were two attempts made in this reign to
&s;ettle colonies in America; one by Sir Humphry Gil|bert
in Newfoundland, another by Sir Walter Raleigh
in Virginia: But neither of the&s;e projects proved &s;uc|ce&s;sful.
All the&s;e noble &s;ettlements were made in the
following reigns. The current money of the king|dom,
in the end of this reign, is computed at four mil|lions<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Lives of the Admirals, vol. I. p. 475.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE nobility in this age &s;upported &s;till, in &s;ome de|gree,
the ancient magnificence in their ho&s;pitality, and
in the numbers of their retainers; and the Queen found
it prudent to retrench, by proclamation, their ex|pences
in this la&s;t particular<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. Appen. p. 54.</NOTE>. The expence of ho&s;|pitality,
&s;he &s;omewhat encouraged, by the frequent
vi&s;its &s;he paid her nobility, and the magnificent fea&s;ts
which &s;he received from them. The earl of Leice&s;ter
gave her an entertainment in Kenilworth ca&s;tle, which
was extraordinary for expence and magnificence.
Among other particulars, we are told, that three hun|dred
and &s;ixty-five hog&s;heeds of beer were drank at it<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Biogr, Brit. vol. III. p. 1791.</NOTE>.
The earl had fortified this ca&s;tle at great expence; and
it contained arms for ten thou&s;and men<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. III. p. 394.</NOTE>. The earl
of Derby had a family con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred and
forty &s;ervants<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 674.</NOTE>. Stowe remarks it as a &s;ingular proof
of beneficence in this nobleman, that he was con|tented
with his rent from his tenants, and exacted not

any extraordinary &s;ervices from them: A proof that
the ab&s;olute power of the &s;overeign (what was almo&s;t
unavoidable) had very generally countenanced the no|bility

&s;tanding table for gentlemen, and two other tables for
per&s;ons of meaner condition, which were always &s;erved
alike, whether he was in town or in the country.
About his per&s;on he had people of great di&s;tinction,
in&s;omuch that he could reckon up twenty gentlemen
retainers who had each a thou&s;and pounds a year; and
as many among his ordinary &s;ervants, who were worth
from a thou&s;and pounds to three, five, ten, and twenty
thou&s;and pounds<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Biogr, Brit. p. 1267.</NOTE>. It is to be remarked, that, tho'
the revenue of the crown was at that time very &s;mall,
the mini&s;ters and courtiers found means, by employing
the exorbitant prerogative, to acquire much greater
fortunes than it is po&s;&s;ible for them at pre&s;ent to
gain, from their larger &s;alaries, and more limited au|thority.</P>
<P>BUT
tho' there were pre&s;erved great remains of the
ancient cu&s;toms, the nobility were, by degrees,
acquiring a ta&s;te of elegant luxury; and many edifices,
in particular, were built by $hem, neat, large, and
&s;umptuous, to the great ornament of the kingdom, &s;ays
Camden<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Page 452.</NOTE>; but to the no le&s;s decay of the glorious
ho&s;pitality of the nation. It is, however, more rea|&s;onable
to think, that this new turn of expence pro|moted
arts and indu&s;try; while the ancient ho&s;pitality
was the &s;ource of vice, di&s;order, &s;edition, and idle|ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="566">
AMONG the other &s;pecies of luxury, that of apparel
began much to increa&s;e during this age; and the Queen
thought proper to re&s;train it by proclamation<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Camden, p. 452.</NOTE>. Her
example was very little conformable to her edicts. As
no woman was ever more conceited of her beauty,
nor more de&s;irous of making impre&s;&s;ion on the hearts
of beholders, no one ever went to a greater extrava|gance
in apparel, or &s;tudied more the variety and rich|ne&s;s
of her dre&s;&s;es. She appeared almo&s;t every day in
a different habit; and tried all the &s;everal modes, by
which &s;he hoped to render her&s;elf agreeable. She was
al&s;o &s;o fond of her cloaths, that &s;he never could part with
any of them; and at her death &s;he had in her wardrobe
all the different habits, to the number of three thou&s;and,
which &s;he had ever worn in her life-time<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol. III. p. 702. from Beaumont's Di&s;patches.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE retrenchment of the ancient ho&s;pitality, and
the diminution of retainers, were favourable to the
prerogative of the &s;overeign; and by di&s;abling the great
noblemen from re&s;i&s;tance, promoted the execution of
the laws, and extended the authority of the courts of
ju&s;tice. There were many particular cau&s;es in the
&s;ituation and character of Henry the &s;eventh, which
augmented the authority of the crown: Mo&s;t of the&s;e
cau&s;es concurred in &s;ucceeding princes; together with
the factions of religion, and the acqui&s;ition of the &s;u|premacy,
a mo&s;t important article of prerogative: But
the manners of the age were a general cau&s;e, which
operated during this whole period, and which continu|ally
tended to dimini&s;h the riches, and &s;till more the
influence, of the Ari&s;tocracy, anciently &s;o formidable
to the crown. The habits of luxury di&s;&s;ipated the
immen&s;e fortunes of the ancient barons; and as the
new methods of expence gave &s;ub&s;i&s;tance to mechanics
<PB N="506" REF="567">
and merchants, who lived in an independant manner on
the fruits of their own indu&s;try, a nobleman, in&s;tead of
that unlimited a&s;cendant which he was wont to a&s;&s;ume
over tho&s;e who were maintained at his board, or &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
by &s;alaries conferred on them, retained only that
moderate influence which cu&s;tomers have over trade&s;|men,
and which can never be dangerous to civil go|vernment.
The landed proprietors al&s;o having a greater
demand for money than for men, endeavoured to turn
their lands to the be&s;t account with regard to profit,
and either inclo&s;ing their fields, or joining many &s;mall
farms into a few large ones, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed tho&s;e u&s;ele&s;s
hands which formerly were always at their call, in
every attempt to &s;ubvert the government, or oppo&s;e a
neighbouring baron. By all the&s;e means the cities in|crea&s;ed;
the middle rank of men began to be rich and
powerful; the prince, who in effect was the &s;ame
with the law, was implicitly obeyed; and tho' the
farther progre&s;s of the &s;ame cau&s;es begot a new plan
of liberty, founded on the privileges of the commons,
yet in the interval between the fall of the nobles and the
ri&s;e of this order, the &s;overeign took advantage of the
pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and a&s;&s;umed an authority almo&s;t
ab&s;olute.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be commonly imagined, from the
authority of lord Bacon, and from that of Harring|ton,
and later authors, the laws of Henry the &s;eventh
contributed very little towards the great revolutions
which happened about this period in the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution.
The practice of breaking entails, by a fine
and recovery, had been introduced in the preceding
reigns; and this prince only gave indirectly a legal
&s;anction to the practice, by reforming &s;ome abu&s;es
which attended it. But the &s;ettled authority, which he
acquired to the crown, enabled the &s;overeign to en|croach
on the &s;eparate juri&s;dictions of the barons, and
<PB N="507" REF="568">
produced a more general and regular execution of the
laws. The counties palatine underwent the &s;ame fate
as the feudal juri&s;dictions; and by a &s;tatute of Henry
the eighth<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII. c. 24.</NOTE>, the juri&s;diction of the&s;e counties was an|nexed
to the crown, and all writs were ordained to
run in the King's name. But the change of manners
was the chief cau&s;e of the &s;ecret revolution of the
government, and &s;ubverted the power of the ba|rons.</P>
<P>LEARNING,
on its fir&s;t revival, was held in great
e&s;timation by the Engli&s;h princes and nobles; and as
it was not yet pro&s;tituted by being too common, even
the Great deemed it an object of ambition to attain a
character for literature. The four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;overeigns,
Henry, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth, may, on one
account or other, be admitted into the cla&s;s of authors.
Queen Catherine Parr tran&s;lated a book: Lady Jane
Gray, con&s;idering her age, and her &s;ex, and her &s;ta|tion,
may be regarded as a prodigy of literature. Sir
Thomas Smith was rai&s;ed from being profe&s;&s;or in Cam|bridge,
fir&s;t to be amba&s;&s;ador to France, and then
&s;ecretary of &s;tate. The di&s;patches of tho&s;e times, and
among others tho&s;e of Burleigh him&s;elf, are very fre|quently
interlarded with quotations from the Greek
and Latin cla&s;&s;ics. Even the ladies of the court va|lued
them&s;elves on knowlege: Lady Burleigh, lady
Bacon, and their two &s;i&s;ters, were mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of the
ancient, as well as modern languages; and valued them|&s;elves
more on their erudition than on their rank and
quality.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth wrote and tran&s;lated &s;everal
books; and &s;he was familiarly acquainted with the
Greek as well as Latin tongue. It is pretended, that
<PB N="508" REF="569">
&s;he made an extemporary reply in Greek to the uni|ver&s;ity
of Cambridge, who had addre&s;&s;ed her in that
language. It is certain, that &s;he an&s;wered in Latin,
without premeditation, and in a very &s;pirited manner,
to the Poli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, who had been wanting in
re&s;pect to her. When &s;he had fini&s;hed, &s;he turned
about to her courtiers, and &s;aid, &startq;God's death, my
lord,&endq; (for &s;he was much addicted to &s;wearing) &startq;I
have been forced this day to &s;cour up my old Latin,
that hath long lain ru&s;ting<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Speed.</NOTE>.&endq; Elizabeth, even after
&s;he was Queen, did not entirely drop the ambition
of appearing as an author; and next to her de&s;ire of
admiration for beauty, this &s;eems to have been the
chief object of her vanity. She tran&s;lated Boethius of
the Con&s;olation of Philo&s;ophy; in order, as &s;he pre|tended,
to allay her grief for Henry the fourth's change
of religion. As far as we can judge from Elizabeth's
compo&s;itions, we may pronounce, that notwith&s;tanding
her application, and her excellent parts, her ta&s;te in
literature was very indifferent: She was even inferior
to her &s;ucce&s;&s;or in this particular, who was him&s;elf
far from being a ju&s;t model of eloquence.</P>
<P>UNHAPPILY for literature, at lea&s;t for the learned of
this age, the Queen's vanity lay more in &s;hining by
her own learning, than in encouraging men of genius
by her liberality. Spencer him&s;elf, the fine&s;t Engli&s;h
writer of his age, was long neglected; and after the
death of Sir Philip Sydney, his patron, was allowed to
die almo&s;t for want. This poet contains great beauties,
a &s;weet and harmonious ver&s;ification, ea&s;y elocution, a
fine imagination; Yet does the peru&s;al of his work
become &s;o tedious, that one never fini&s;hes it from the
mere plea&s;ure which it affords: It &s;oon becomes a
kind of ta&s;k-reading; and it requires &s;ome effort
<PB N="509" REF="570">
and re&s;olution to carry us on to the end of his long
performance. This effect, of which every one is con|&s;cious,
is u&s;ually a&s;cribed to the change of manners:
But manners have more changed &s;ince Homer's age;
and yet that poet remains &s;till the favourite of every
reader of ta&s;te and judgment. Homer copied true na|tural
manners, which, however rough or uncultivated,
will always form an agreeable and intere&s;ting picture:
But the pencil of the Engli&s;h poet was employed in
drawing the affections, and conceits, and fopperies
of chivalry, which appear ridiculous as &s;oon as they
lo&s;e the recommendation of the mode. The tediou&s;|ne&s;s
of continued allegory, and that too &s;eldom &s;trik|ing
or ingenious, has al&s;o contributed to render the
<HI>Fairy Queen</HI> peculiarly tire&s;ome; not to mention the
too great frequency of its de&s;criptions, and the langour
of its &s;tanza. Upon the whole, Spencer maintains his
place in the &s;helves among our Engli&s;h cla&s;&s;ics: But
he is &s;eldom &s;een on the table; and there is &s;carce any
one, if he dares to be ingenuous, but will confe&s;s, that,
notwith&s;tanding all the merit of the poet, he affords an
entertainment with which the palate is &s;oon &s;atiated.
Several writers of late have amu&s;ed them&s;elves in copy|ing
the &s;tile of Spencer; and no imitation has been
&s;o indifferent as not to bear a great re&s;emblance of the
original: His manner is &s;o peculiar, that it is almo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible not to transfer &s;ome of it into the copy.

<P>THE crown of England was never tran&s;mitted
from father to &s;on with greater tranquillity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLV.</NOTE> than
it pa&s;&s;ed from the family of Tudor to that of Stuart.
During the whole reign of Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1603.</NOTE> the eyes of men
had been employed in &s;earch of her &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and when
old age made the pro&s;pect of her death more imme|diate,
there appeared none but the King of Scotland,
who could advance any ju&s;t claim or preten&s;ion to the
throne. He was the great-grand&s;on of Margaret, el|de&s;t
daughter of Henry VII. and, on the failure of all
the male-line, his hereditary right remained unque&s;ti|onable.
If the religion of Mary Queen of Scots, and
the other prejudices contracted again&s;t her, had formed
any con&s;iderable ob&s;tacle to her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; the&s;e ob|jections,
being entirely per&s;onal, had no place with
regard to her &s;on. Men al&s;o con&s;idered, that, tho'
the title, derived from blood, had been frequently vio|lated
&s;ince the Norman conque&s;t, &s;uch licences had
proceeded more from force or intrigue, than from any
deliberate maxims of government. The lineal heir
had &s;till in the end prevailed; and both his exclu&s;ion
and re&s;toration had been commonly attended with &s;uch
convul&s;ions, as were &s;ufficient to warn all prudent
m$$ not lightly to give way to &s;uch irregularities. If
the will of Henry VIII. authori&s;ed by act of parlia|ment,
had tacitly excluded the Scotti&s;h line; the ty|ranny
and caprices of that monarch had rendered his
memory &s;o odious, that a &s;ettlement of this nature, un|&s;upported
<PB N="511" REF="574">
by any ju&s;t rea&s;on, had no authority with
the people. Queen Elizabeth too, with her dying
breath, had recognized the undoubted title of her kin&s;|man
James; and the whole nation &s;eemed to di&s;po&s;e
them&s;elves with joy and plea&s;ure for his reception. Tho'
born and educated amid&s;t a foreign and ho&s;tile people,
men hoped, from his character of moderation and wi&s;|dom,
that he would embrace the maxims of an Engli&s;h
monarch; and the prudent fore&s;aw greater advanta|ges,
re&s;ulting from an union with Scotland, than di&s;|advantages
from &s;ubmitting to a prince of that nation.
The alacrity, with which the Engli&s;h looked towards
the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, had apppeared &s;o evident to Elizabeth,
that, concurring with other cau&s;es, it affected her with
the deepe&s;t melancholy; and that wi&s;e Prince&s;s, who&s;e
penetration and experience had given her the greate&s;t
in&s;ight into human affairs, had not yet &s;ufficiently
weighed the ingratitude of courtiers, and levity of the
people.</P>
<P>As victory abroad, and tranquillity at home, had
ever attended this Queen, &s;he left the nation in &s;uch
flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances, that her &s;ucce&s;&s;or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
every advantage, except that of compari&s;on with her
illu&s;trious name, when he mounted the throne of Eng|land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t
tran&s;|actions of this reign.</NOTE> The King's journey from Edinburgh to Lon|don
immediately afforded to the inqui&s;itive &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances
of compari&s;on, which even the natural par|tiality
in favour of their new &s;overeign, could not in|terpret
to his advantage. As he pa&s;&s;ed along, all ranks
of men flocked about him, from every quarter; allured
by intere&s;t or curio&s;ity. Great were the rejoicings,
and loud and hearty the acclamations which re&s;ounded
from all &s;ides; and every one could remember how
the affability and popularity of their Queen di&s;played
them&s;elves, amid&s;t &s;uch concour&s;e and exultation of
<PB N="512" REF="575">
her &s;ubjects. But James, tho' &s;ociable and familiar
with his friends and courtiers, hated the bu&s;tle of a
mixt multitude; and tho' far from di&s;liking flattery,
yet was he &s;till fonder of tranquillity and ea&s;e. He
therefore i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, forbidding this great
re&s;ort of people, on pretence of the &s;carcity of provi|&s;ions,
and other inconveniencies, which would ne|ce&s;&s;arily
attend it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Kennet. p. 662.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE was not, however, in&s;en&s;ible to the great over|flow
of affection, which appeared in his new &s;ubjects;
and being him&s;elf of an affectionate temper, he &s;eems
to have been in ha&s;te to make them &s;ome return of kind|ne&s;s
and good offices. To this motive, probably, we
are to a&s;cribe that profu&s;ion of titles, which was ob|&s;erved
in the beginning of his reign; when in &s;ix weeks
time, after his entrance into the kingdom, he is com|puted
to have be&s;towed knighthood on no le&s;s than
237 per&s;ons. If Queen Elizabeth's frugality of hon|ours,
as well as of money, had been formerly repined
at, it began now to be valued and e&s;teemed: And every
one was &s;en&s;ible, that the King, by his lavi&s;h and pre|mature
conferring of favours, had failed of obliging
the per&s;ons, on whom he be&s;towed them. Titles of
all kinds became &s;o common, that they were no longer
marks of di&s;tinction; and being di&s;tributed, without
choice or deliberation, to per&s;ons, unknown to the
Prince, were regarded more as the proofs of facility
and good-nature, than of any determined friend&s;hip
or e&s;teem.</P>
<P>A pa&s;quinade was affixed to St Paul's, in which an
art was promi&s;ed to be taught, very nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t
frail memories, in retaining the names of the new
Nobility<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wil&s;on, in Kennet, p. 665.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="513" REF="576">
WE may pre&s;ume, that the Engli&s;h would have
thrown le&s;s blame on the King's facility in be&s;towing
favours, had the&s;e been confined entirely to their own
nation, and had not been &s;hared out, in too unequal
proportions, to his old &s;ubjects. James, who, thro'
his whole reign, was more guided by temper and in|clination
than by the rules of political prudence, had
brought with him great numbers of his Scots courtiers;
who&s;e impatience and importunity were apt, in many
particulars, to impo&s;e on the ea&s;y nature of their ma&s;ter,
and extort favours, of which, it is natural to imagine,
his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects would very loudly complain. The
Duke of Lenox, the Earl of Mar, the Lord Hume,
Lord Kinlo&s;s, Sir George Hume, Secretary Elphin|&s;tone<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Wil&s;on in Kennet, p. 662.</NOTE>, were immediately added to the Engli&s;h privy
council. Sir George Hume, whom he created Earl of
Dunbar, was his declared favourite as long as that
Nobleman lived; and was the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous,
tho' the lea&s;t powerful, of all tho&s;e whom the King
ever honoured with that di&s;tinction. Hay, &s;ome time
after, was created Vi&s;count Donca&s;ter, and then Earl
of Carli&s;le, and got an immen&s;e fortune from the
crown; all which he &s;pent in a &s;plendid and courtly
manner. Ram&s;ay obtained the title of Earl of Holder|ne&s;s;
and many others, being rai&s;ed, on a &s;udden, to
the highe&s;t elevation, encrea&s;ed, by their in&s;olence,
that envy, which naturally attended them, as enemies
and &s;trangers.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t, however, be owned, in ju&s;tice to James,
that he left almo&s;t all the chief offices in the hands of
Elizabeth's mini&s;ters, and tru&s;ted the conduct of poli|tical
concerns, both foreign and dome&s;tic, to his Eng|li&s;h
&s;ubjects. Among the&s;e, Secretary Cecil, created
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively Lord E&s;&s;indon, Vi&s;count Cranborne, and

Earl of Sali&s;bury, was always regarded as his prime
mini&s;ter and chief coun&s;ellor. Tho' the capacity and
penetration of this mini&s;ter were &s;ufficiently known,
his favour with the King created great &s;urprize on the
acce&s;&s;ion of that monarch. Cecil was &s;on of the fa|mous
Burleigh, who&s;e merits towards his &s;overeign
and his country were great, but who&s;e name was na|turally
odious to James; as the declared enemy of his
mother, and the chief cau&s;e of her tragical death, by
&s;ome e&s;teemed the great &s;tain in the bright annals of
Elizabeth. He him&s;elf, as well as his father, had &s;tood
at the head of the court-faction, which oppo&s;ed the
greatne&s;s of the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, and which, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
the imprudence or rather frenzy of that favourite, at
la&s;t brought him to the &s;caffold. The people, by whom
the Earl was infinitely beloved, refented the conduct of
his enemies; but James &s;till more, who had main|tained
a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with E&s;&s;ex, and regarded
him as a zealous partizan for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e
of Stuart. Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord Grey, Lord
Cobham, Cecil's a&s;&s;ociates, felt immediately the effects
of the&s;e prejudices of their ma&s;ter, and were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
from their employments<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 663.</NOTE>: But Cecil, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
all the art and cunning of a courtier, as well as many
of the talents of a great &s;tate&s;man, had found the means
of making his peace with James; and, unknown both
to Elizabeth and all the other mini&s;ters, had entered
into a &s;ecret commerce with the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, during the
latter years of the Queen's admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE capacity of James and his mini&s;ters in negoti|ation
was immediately put to trial, on the appear|ance
of amba&s;&s;adors from almo&s;t all the princes and
&s;tates of Europe, in order to congratulate the King
on his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and to form with him
<PB N="515" REF="580">
new treaties and alliances. Be&s;ide mini&s;ters from
Venice, Denmark, the Palatinate; Henry Frederic of
Na&s;&s;au, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Barnevelt the Pen&s;ionary of Holland,
repre&s;ented the &s;tates of the United Provinces. Arem|berg
was &s;ent by Archduke Albert; and Taxis was ex|pected
in a little time from Spain. But he who ex|cited
mo&s;t the attention of the public, both on account
of his own merit and that of his ma&s;ter, was the Mar|que&s;s
of Ro&s;ni,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of June.</NOTE> afterwards Duke of Sully, prime mi|ni&s;ter
and favourite of Henry IV. of France.</P>
<P>WHEN the dominions of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria devolv|ed
on Philip II. all Europe was &s;truck with terror;<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Eu|rope.</NOTE> le&s;t
the power of a family, which had been rai&s;ed by fortune,
&s;hould now be carried to an immea&s;urable height, by
the wi&s;dom and conduct of this monarch. But never
were apprehen&s;ions found in the event to be more
groundle&s;s. Slow without prudence, ambitious with|out
enterprize, fal&s;e without deceiving any body,
and refined without any true judgement; &s;uch
was the character of Philip and &s;uch the cha|racter,
which during his life-time and after his death,
he impre&s;&s;ed on the Spani&s;h councils. Revolted or
depopulated provinces, di&s;contented or indolent inha|bitants,
were the &s;pectacles, which tho&s;e dominions,
lying in every climate of the globe, pre&s;ented to Philip
III. a weak prince, and to the Duke of Lerma, a mi|ni&s;ter,
weak and odious. But tho' military di&s;cipline,
which &s;till remained, was what alone gave &s;ome appear|ance
of life and vigour to that langui&s;hing body; yet
&s;uch was the terror, produced by former power and am|bition,
that the reduction of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria was
the object of men's vows, throughout all the &s;tates of
chri&s;tendom. It was not perceived, that the French
empire, now united in dome&s;tic peace, and governed
by the mo&s;t heroic and mo&s;t amiable prince, that adorns
modern &s;tory, was become, of it&s;elf, a &s;ufficient coun|terpoi&s;e
<PB N="516" REF="581">
to the Spani&s;h greatne&s;s. Perhaps, that prince
him&s;elf did not perceive it, when he propo&s;ed, by his
mini&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro&s;ni's ne|gotiations.</NOTE> a league with James, in conjunction with Ve|nice,
the United Provinces, and the northern crowns;
in order to attack the Au&s;trian dominions on every &s;ide,
and depre&s;s the exorbitant power of that ambitious
family<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sully's Memoirs.</NOTE>. But the genius of the Engli&s;h monarch was
not equal to &s;uch va&s;t enterprizes. The love of peace
was his ruling pa&s;&s;ion; and it was his peculiar felicity,
that the conjunctures of the times rendered the &s;ame
object which was agreeable to him, in the highe&s;t de|gree
advantageous to his people.</P>
<P>THE French amba&s;&s;ador, therefore, was obliged to
depart from the&s;e exten&s;ive aims, and to concert with
James the means of providing for the &s;afety of the Unit|ed
Provinces: Nor was this object altogether without
its difficulties. The King, before his acce&s;&s;ion to the
throne of England, had entertained very &s;trong &s;cruples
with regard to the revolt of the Low Countries; and
being always open and &s;incere<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;ieur de la Boderie, the French leaguer, amba&s;&s;ador at that time in England, a&s;cribes the virtue of openne&s;s and &s;incerity to the King. <HI>Le naturel du Roi e&s;t a&s;&s;ez ouvert.</HI> vol. i. p. 120.</NOTE>, except when delibe|rately
re&s;olved to di&s;&s;emble, he had, on many occa&s;ions,
gone &s;o far as to give to the Dutch the denomination
of rebels, but having conver&s;ed more fully with Engli&s;h
mini&s;ters and courtiers, he found their attachment to that
republic &s;o &s;trong, and their opinion of common intere&s;t &s;o
e&s;tabli&s;hed, that he was obliged to &s;acrifice to politics his
&s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice; a quality, which, even when errone|ous,
is re&s;pectable as well as rare in a monarch. He
therefore agreed with Ro&s;ni to &s;upport &s;ecretly the
&s;tates-general, in concert with the King of France;
le&s;t their weakne&s;s and de&s;pair &s;hould oblige them to
&s;ubmit to their old ma&s;ter. The articles of the treaty
were few and &s;imple. It was &s;tipulated, that the two<NOTE PLACE="foot">s Winwood, vol. 2. p. 55.</NOTE>
<PB N="517" REF="582">
Kings &s;hould allow the Dutch to levy forces both in
France and Britain; and &s;hould underhand remit to
that republic the &s;um of 1,400,000 livres a year for the
pay of the&s;e forces: That the whole &s;um &s;hould be
advanced by the King of France; but that the third
of it &s;hould be deducted from a debt due by him to
Queen Elizabeth. And if the Spaniard attacked either
of the Princes, they agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other; Henry
with a force of ten thou&s;and, James with that of &s;ix
thou&s;and men. This treaty, one of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t
equitable concluded by James, during the whole cour&s;e
of his reign, was more the work of the Prince him&s;elf,
than any of his mini&s;ters<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Sully's Memoirs.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMIDST the great tranquillity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Raleigh's con&s;piracy.</NOTE> both foreign and do|me&s;tic,
with which the nation was ble&s;t, nothing could
be more &s;urpri&s;ing than the di&s;covery of a con&s;piracy
to &s;ubvert the government, and to fix on the throne of
England Arabella Stuart, a near relation of the King,
and de&s;cended equally from Henry VII. Every thing
remains &s;till my&s;terious in this con&s;piracy; and hi&s;tory
can give us no clue to unravel it. Wat&s;on and Clarke,
two catholic prie&s;ts, were accu&s;ed of the plot: Lord
Grey, a puritan: Lord Cobham, a thoughtle&s;s man
of no fixt principle: And Sir Walter Raleigh, &s;u&s;|pected
to be of that philo&s;ophical &s;ect, who were then
extremely rare in England, and who have &s;ince received
the appellation of <HI>free-thinkers.</HI> Together with the&s;e,
Mr. Broke, brother to Lord Cobham, Sir Griffin Mark|ham,
Mr. Copeley, Sir Edward Parham. What ce|ment
could unite men of &s;uch di&s;cordant principles in
&s;o dangerous a combination; what end they propo&s;ed,
or what means proportioned to an undertaking of this
nature, has never yet been explained, and cannot ea&s;ily
be imagined. As Raleigh, Grey, and Cobham were
<PB N="518" REF="583">
commonly believed, after the Queen's death, to have
oppo&s;ed proclaiming the King, till conditions &s;hould
be made with him; they were, upon that, as well as
other accounts, extremely obnoxious to the court and
mini&s;try; and people were apt, at fir&s;t, to &s;u&s;pect, that
the plot was merely a contrivance of Secretary Cecil,
to get rid of his old confederates, now become his mo&s;t
inveterate enemies. But the confe&s;&s;ion, as well as trial
of the criminals, put the matter beyond all doubt<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">State Trials, p. 180. 2d Edit. Winwood Vol. 2. p. 8, 11.</NOTE>.
And tho' no one could find any marks of a concerted
enterprize, it appeared, that men of furious and am|bitious
&s;pirits, meeting frequently together, and believ|ing
all the world di&s;contented like them&s;elves, had enter|tained
very criminal projects, and had even entered,
&s;ome of them at lea&s;t, into a corre&s;pondence with Arem|berg,
the Flemi&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, in order to give di&s;turbance
to the new &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>THE two prie&s;ts<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">November 29.</NOTE> and Broke<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">December 5.</NOTE> were executed: Cob|ham,
Grey, and Marham were pardoned<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">December 3.</NOTE>, after they
had laid their heads upon the block<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. $. p. 1$.</NOTE>. Raleigh too
was reprieved, not pardoned; and he remained in con|finement
many years afterwards.</P>
<P>IT appears from Sully's Memoirs, that Raleigh &s;ecretly
offered his &s;ervices to the French amba&s;&s;ador; and we
may thence pre&s;ume, that, meeting with a repul&s;e from
that quarter, he had recour&s;e, for the &s;ame unwarran|table
purpo&s;es, to the Flemi&s;h mini&s;ter. Such a con|jecture
we are now enabled to form; but it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, that, on his trial, there appeared no proof
of this tran&s;action, nor indeed any circum&s;tance which
could ju&s;tify his condemnation. He was accu&s;ed by
Cobham alone, in a &s;udden fit of pa&s;&s;ion, upon hear|ing,
that Raleigh, when examined, had pointed out
<PB N="519" REF="584">
&s;ome circum&s;tances, by which Cobham's guilt might
be known and a&s;certained. This accu&s;ation Cobham
afterwards retracted; and &s;oon after, retracted his re|tractation.
Yet, upon the written evidence of this
&s;ingle witne&s;s, a man of no honour nor under&s;tand|ing,
and &s;o contradictory in his te&s;timony; not con|fronted
with Raleigh; not &s;upported by any concur|ring
circum&s;tance; was that great man, contrary to
all law and equity, found guilty by the jury. His name
was at that time extremely odious in England; and
every man was plea&s;ed to give &s;entence again&s;t the
capital enemy of E&s;&s;ex, the favourite of the people.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Coke, the famous lawyer, then attor|ney-general,
managed the cau&s;e for the crown, and
threw out on Raleigh &s;uch gro&s;s abu&s;e, as may be
deemed a great reflection, not only on his own me|mory,
but even, in &s;ome degree, on the manners of
that age. Traitor, mon&s;ter, viper, and &s;pider of hell,
are the terms, which he employs again&s;t one of the mo&s;t
illu&s;trious men of the kingdom, who was under trial
for life and fortune, and who defended him&s;elf with
&s;urpri&s;ing temper, eloquence, and courage<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">State Trials, 1&s;t Edit. p. 176, 177, 182.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE next occupation of the King was entirely ac|cording
to his heart's content.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1604.</NOTE> He was now employed,
in dictating magi&s;terially to an a&s;&s;embly of divines con|cerning
points of faith and di&s;cipline, and in receiving
the applau&s;es of the&s;e holy men for his &s;uperior zeal
and learning. The religious di&s;putes between the
church and the puritans had induced him to call a con|ference
at Hampton-court, on pretence of finding ex|pedients,
which might reconcile both parties.</P>
<P>THO' the &s;everities of Elizabeth towards the catho|lics
had much weakened that party, who&s;e genius was
aver&s;e to the prevailing &s;pirit of the nation; like &s;eve|rities
<PB N="520" REF="585">
had had &s;o little influence on the puritans, who
were encouraged by that &s;pirit, that no le&s;s than &s;even
hundred and fifty clergymen of that party &s;igned a
petition to the King on his acce&s;&s;ion; and many more
&s;eemed willing to adhere to it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fuller Book, 10. Collier vol. 2. p. 672.</NOTE>. They all hoped,
that James, having received his education in Scotland,
and having ever profe&s;&s;ed an attachment to the church
e&s;tabli&s;hed there, would at lea&s;t abate the rigour of the
laws enacted again&s;t puritans; if he did not &s;how them
more particular grace and encouragement. But the
King's di&s;po&s;ition had taken &s;trongly a contrary bya&s;s.
The more he knew the puritanical clergy, the le&s;s fa|vour
he bore them. He had remarked in their Scots
brethren a violent turn towards republicani&s;m, and a
zealous attachment to civil liberty; principles nearly
allied to that religious enthu&s;ia&s;m, with which they were
actuated. He had found, that being mo&s;tly per&s;ons
of low birth and mean education, the &s;ame lofty pre|ten&s;ions,
which attended them in their familiar ad|dre&s;&s;es
to their Maker, of whom they believed them|&s;elves
the peculiar favourites, induced them to u&s;e the
utmo&s;t freedoms with their earthly &s;overeign. In both
capacities, of monarch and of theologian, $$$ad expe|rienced
the little complai&s;ance, which they were di&s;|po&s;ed
to &s;how him; whil&s;t they controuled his com|mands,
di&s;puted his tenets, and to his face, before the
whole people, cen&s;ured his conduct and behaviour.
If he had &s;ubmitted to the indignity of courting their
favour, he trea&s;ured up the &s;tronger re&s;entment again&s;t
them, and was determined to make them feel, in their
turn, the weight of his authority. Tho' he had often
met with re&s;i&s;tance and faction and ob&s;tinacy in the
Scots nobility, he retained no ill-will to that order; or
rather &s;howed them favour and kindne&s;s in England,
<PB N="521" REF="586">
beyond what rea&s;on and &s;ound policy could well ju&s;tify:
But the a&s;cendant, which the pre&s;byterian clergy had
a&s;&s;umed over him, was what his monarchical pride could
never thoroughly dige&s;t<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">James ventured to &s;ay in his Ba&s;ilicon Doron, publi&s;hed while he was in Scotland: &startq;I prote&s;t before the great God, and &s;ince I am here as upon my Te&s;tament, it is no place for me to lie in, that ye &s;hall never find with any Highland or Borderer Thieves, greater ingratitude and more lyes and vile perjuries, than with the&s;e fanatic &s;pirits: And &s;uffer not the principal of them to brook your land.&endq; <HI>K. James Works,</HI> p. 161.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE dreaded likewi&s;e the popularity, which attended
this order of men in both kingdoms. As u&s;ele&s;s au|&s;terities
and &s;elf-denial are imagined, in many religi|ons,
to render us acceptable to a benevolent Being,
who created us &s;olely for happine&s;s, James remarked,
that the ru&s;tic &s;everity of the&s;e clergymen and of their
whole &s;ect had given them, in the eyes of the multi|tude,
the appearance of &s;anctity and virtue. Strongly
inclined him&s;elf to mirth and wine and &s;ports of all
kinds, he apprehended their cen&s;ure for his manner
of life, free and di&s;engaged. And, being thus aver&s;e,
from temper as well as policy, to the &s;ect of puritans,
he was re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent it's further growth
in England.</P>
<P>BUT it was the character of James's councils,
throughout his whole reign, that they were more wi&s;e
and equitable, in their end, than prudent and political,
in the means. Tho' ju&s;tly &s;en&s;ible, that no part of ci|vil
admini&s;tration required greater care or a nicer judg|ment
than the conduct of religious parties, who&s;e va|rious
geniu&s;es, affections and antipathies, have &s;o mighty
an influence on public affairs; he had not perceived,
that in the &s;ame proportion as this practical knowlege
of theology is requi&s;ite, the &s;peculative refinements in
it are mean, and even dangerous in a monarch. By
entering zealou&s;ly into frivolous di&s;putes, James gave
them an air of importance and dignity, which they could
<PB N="522" REF="587">
not otherwi&s;e have acquired; and being him&s;elf in|li&s;ted
in the quarrel, he could no longer have recour&s;e
to contempt and ridicule, the only proper method of
appea&s;ing it. The church of England had not yet
abandoned the rigid doctrines of grace and prede&s;tina|tion:
The puritans had not yet totally &s;eparated them|&s;elves
from the church, nor openly renounced epi&s;co|pacy.
Tho' the &s;pirit of the parties was con&s;iderably
different, the only apparent &s;ubjects of di&s;pute were con|cerning
the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m, the ring in marriage, the
u&s;e of the &s;urplice, and the bowing at the name of Je|&s;us.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference at Hampton-court.</NOTE>
The&s;e were the mighty que&s;tions, which were
&s;olemnly agitated in the conference at Hampton-court
between &s;ome bi&s;hops and dignified clergymen on the
one hand, and &s;ome leaders of the puritan party on the
other; the king and his mini&s;ters being pre&s;ent<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fuller's Eccle&s;ia&s;t. Hi&s;tory.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE puritans were here &s;o unrea&s;onable as to complain
of a partial and unfair management of the di&s;pute;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of Janu|ary.</NOTE> as
if the &s;earch after truth were in any degree the object
of &s;uch conferences, and a candid indifference, &s;o rare
even among private inquirers in <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> que&s;tions,
could ever be expected among princes and prelates, in
a <HI>theological</HI> controver&s;y. The King, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
from the beginning of the Conference, &s;howed
the &s;tronge&s;t propen&s;ity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and
frequently inculcated a maxim, which, tho' it has &s;ome
foundation, is to be received with great limitations,
No BISHOP, No KING. The bi&s;hops, in their turn,
were very liberal of their prai&s;es towards the royal di&s;|putant;
and the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury &s;aid, that
<HI>undoubtedly his Maje&s;ty &s;poke by the &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance of

agreed to, and both parties &s;eparated with mutual di&s;&s;a|tisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="523" REF="588">
IT had frequently been the practice of puritanical
clergymen to form together certain a&s;&s;emblies, which
they called <HI>prophe&s;yings;</HI> where alternately, as moved
by the &s;pirit, they di&s;played their pious zeal in prayers
and exhortations, and rai&s;ed their own enthu&s;ia&s;m, as
well as that of their audience, to the highe&s;t pitch, from
that &s;ocial contagion, which has &s;o mighty an influence
on holy &s;ervours, and from the mutual emulation,
which aro&s;e in tho&s;e trials of religious eloquence. Such
dangerous &s;ocieties had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Elizabeth;
and the mini&s;ters in this conference moved the King
for their revival. But James &s;harply replied, <HI>If you aim

as God and the devil. There</HI> Jack <HI>and</HI> Tom <HI>and</HI> Will <HI>and</HI>

of it in a year; tho' the City contained at that time
only about 150,000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE &s;peech, which the King made on opening the

Tho' few productions of the age &s;urpa&s;s this
&s;peech either in &s;tyle or matter; it wants that maje&s;ti$
brevity and re&s;erve, which becomes a king in his ad|dre&s;&s;es
to the great council of the nation. It contains,
however, a very remarkable &s;troke of candor, where
he confe&s;&s;es his too great facility in yielding to the &s;olli|citations
of &s;uitors<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 495, 496.</NOTE>. A fault, which he promi&s;es to
correct, but which adhered to him, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him,
during the whole cour&s;e of his reign.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, in which the commons were en|gaged,
was of the utmo&s;t importance to the pre&s;ervation
of their privileges; and neither temper nor re&s;olution
were wanting in their conduct of it.</P>
<P>IN former periods of the Engli&s;h government, the
hou&s;e of commons were of &s;o &s;mall weight in the bal|ance
of the con&s;titution, that little attention had been
given, either by the crown, the people, or the hou&s;e
it&s;elf, to the choice and continuance of the members.
It had been u&s;ual, after parliaments were prolonged
beyond one &s;e&s;&s;ion, for the chancellor to exert a di&s;cre|tionary
authority, of i&s;&s;uing new writs to &s;upply the
place of any members, whom he judged incapable
of attending, either on account of their employment,
their &s;ickne&s;s, or other impediment. This practice
gave that mini&s;ter, and con&s;equently the prince, an un|limited
power of garbling at plea&s;ure the repre&s;entatives
of the nation; yet &s;o little jealou&s;y had it created, that
the commons of them&s;elves, without an, court influ|ence
or intrigue, and contrary to &s;ome former votes
of their own, confirmed it in the twenty third of Eliza|beth<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Journ, January 19, 1580.</NOTE>. At that time, tho' &s;ome members, who&s;e
place had been &s;upplied on account of &s;ickne&s;s, having
<PB N="525" REF="590">
now recovered their health, appeared in the hou&s;e, and
claimed their &s;eat; &s;uch was the authority of the chan|cellor,
that merely out of re&s;pect to him, his &s;entence
was adhered to, and the new members were continued
in their places. Here a mo&s;t dangerous prerogative
was conferred on the crown: But to &s;how the genius
of that age, or rather the channels in which power
then ran, the crown put very little value on this autho|rity;
in&s;omuch, that two days afterwards, the chancel|lor,
of him&s;elf, re&s;igned it back to the commons, and
and gave them power to judge of a particular vacancy
in their hou&s;e. And when the que&s;tion, concerning the
chancellor's new writs, was again brought on the carpet
towards the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the commons were &s;o lit|tle
terrified at the precedent, that, tho' they re-admitted
&s;ome old members, who&s;e &s;eats had been vacated, on
account of &s;light indi&s;po&s;itions, yet they confirmed the
chancellor's &s;entence, in in&s;tances where the di&s;temper
appeared dangerous and incurable<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Journ. March 18, 1580. See farther D'Ewes, p. 430.</NOTE>. Nor did they pro|ceed
any farther, in vindication of their privileges, than
to vote, <HI>that during the &s;itting of parliament there do not,
at any time, any writ go out for the choo&s;ing or returning
any member without the warrant of the hou&s;e.</HI> In Eliza|beth's
reign we may remark, and the reigns pre|ceding,
&s;e&s;&s;ions of parliament u&s;ually continued not
above the twelfth part &s;o long as the vacations: and dur|ing
the latter, the chancellor's power, if he plea&s;ed to
exert it, was &s;till left, by this vote, as unlimited and
unre&s;trained as ever.</P>
<P>IN a &s;ub&s;equent parliament, the ab&s;olute authority
of the Queen was exerted in a manner &s;till more open;
and began for the fir&s;t time to give alarm to the com|mons.

WHEN James &s;ummoned this parliament, he i&s;&s;ued
a proclamation<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Jan. 11, 1604. Rymer, Tom. XVI. p. 561.</NOTE>; in which among many general ad|vices,
which, like a kind tutor, he be&s;towed on his

right of elections: Mo&s;t alarming circum&s;tances, had
there not been rea&s;on to believe, that this mea&s;ure,

An ab&s;olute monarchy in Charles I's an&s;wer to the nineteen propo&s;itions is oppo&s;ed to a limited: and the King of England is acknowleged not to be ab&s;olute. So much had matters changed even before the civil war. In Sir John Forte&s;cue's treati&s;e of ab&s;olute and limited monarchy, a book wrote in the reign of Edward the IVth, the word <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> is taken in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e as at pre&s;ent; and the government of England is &s;aid not to be ab&s;olute. They were the princes of the hou&s;e of Tudor chiefly, who introduced that admini&s;tration, which had the appearance of ab&s;olute government. The princes before them were re&s;trained by the barons; as tho&s;e after them by the Hou&s;e of Commons.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this watchful &s;pirit of liberty,

Goodwin gave his con&s;ent; and the commons em|braced

while they &s;howed their regard for the King, they &s;e|cured

Toby Mathews, a member, had been bani&s;hed by order of council upon direction from his Maje&s;ty. The Parliament not only acquie&s;ced in this arbitrary proceeding, but i&s;&s;ued writs for a new election. Such novices were they, as yet in the principles of Liberty! See Journ. 14 Feb. 1609. Mathews was bani&s;hed by the King, on account of his change of religion to popery. The King had an indulgence to tho&s;e who had been educated catholics: but could not bear the new converts. It was probably the ani|mo&s;ity of the Commons again&s;t the papi&s;ts, which made them acquie&s;ce in this precedent, without reflecting on the con&s;equences!

ABOUT this period, the minds of men, throughout
all Europe, but e&s;pecially in England, &s;eem to have
undergone a general, but in&s;en&s;ible revolution. Tho'
letters had been revived in the preceding age, they &s;eem
to have been chiefly cultivated by men of &s;edentary
profe&s;&s;ions; nor had they, till now, begun to &s;pread
them&s;elves, in any degree, among men of the world.
Arts, both mechancical and liberal, were every day
receiving great improvements. Navigation had ex|tended
it&s;elf over the whole globe. Travelling was
&s;ecure and agreeable. And the general &s;y&s;tem of pro|litics,
in Europe, was become more enlarged and com|prehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>IN
con&s;equence of this univer&s;al fermentation, the
ideas of men enlarged them&s;elves on all &s;ides, and the
&s;everal con&s;tituent parts of the gothic governments,
which &s;eem to have lain a&s;leep for &s;o many ages, began,
every where, to operate and encroach on each other.
On the continent, where the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;cipline had
begot mercenary armies, the prince commonly e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
an unlimited authority, and overpowered, by force or
intrigue, the liberties of the people. In England, the
love of freedom, which, unle&s;s checked, flouri&s;hes ex|tremely
in all liberal natures, acquired new force, and
was regulated by more enlarged views, &s;uitable to that
cultivated under&s;tanding, which became, every day,
more common, among men of birth and education.
A familiar acquaintance with the precious remains of
antiquity excited in every generous brea&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion for
a limited con&s;titution, and begot an emulation of
tho&s;e manly virtues, which the Greek and Roman
authors, by &s;uch animating examples, as well as pathetic
expre&s;&s;ions, recommend to us. The &s;evere, tho' po|pular,
government of Elizaberth had confined this ri|&s;ing
&s;pirit within very narrow bounds: But when a
<PB N="532" REF="597">
new and a foreign family &s;ucceeded to the throne, and
a prince le&s;s dreaded and le&s;s beloved; &s;ymptoms im|mediately
appeared of a more free and independent
genius in the nation.</P>
<P>HAPPILY this Prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither &s;ufficient ca|pacity
to perceive the alteration, nor &s;ufficient art and
vigour to check it in its early advances. Jealous of
regal, becau&s;e con&s;cious of little per&s;onal authority,
he had e&s;tabli&s;hed within his own mind a &s;peculative
&s;y&s;tem of ab&s;olute government, which few of his &s;ub|jects,
he believed, and none but traito$s and rebels,
would make any &s;cruple to admit. On which-ever &s;ide
he ca&s;t his eyes, every thing concurred to encourage
his prejudices. When he compared him&s;elf with the
other hereditary &s;overeigns of Europe, he imagined,
that, as he bore the &s;ame rank, he was intitled to equal
prerogatives; not con&s;idering the innovations lately
introduced by them, and the military force, by which
their authority was &s;upported. In England, that power,
almo&s;t unlimited, which had been exerci&s;ed for above
a century, e&s;pecially during the late reign, he a&s;cribed
&s;olely to royal birth and title; not to the prudence
and &s;pirit of the monarchs, nor to the conjunctures
of the times. Even the oppo&s;ition, which he had
&s;truggled with in Scotland, encouraged him &s;till far|ther
in his favourite notions; while he there &s;aw,
that the &s;ame re&s;i&s;tance, which oppo&s;ed regal authority,
violated all law and order, and made way, either for
the ravages of a barbarous nobility, or for the more
intolerable in&s;olence of &s;editious preachers. In his
own per&s;on, therefore, he thought all legal power to
be centered, by an hereditary and a divine right: And
this opinion might have proved dangerous, if not fatal,
to liberty; had not the firmne&s;s of the per&s;ua&s;ion, and
its &s;eeming evidence induced him to tru&s;t &s;olely to his
<PB N="533" REF="598">
right, without making the &s;malle&s;t provi&s;ion either of
force or politics, in order to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>SUCH were the oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;itions of parliament
and prince, at the commencement of the Scotti&s;h
line; di&s;po&s;itions ju&s;t beginning to exi&s;t and to appear
in the parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">At that time, men of genius and of enlarg'd minds had adopted the principles of liberty, which were, as yet, pretty much unknown to the generality of the people. Sir Matthew Hales had publi&s;h'd a remon&s;trance again&s;t the King's conduct towards the Parliament during this &s;e&s;&s;ion. The remon&s;trance is drawn with great force of rea&s;oning and &s;pirit of liberty; and was the production of Sir Francis Bacon and Sir Edwin Sandys, two men of the greate&s;t parts and knowledge in England. It is drawn in the name of the Parliament; but as there is no hint of it in the journals, we mu&s;t conclude, either that the authors, &s;en&s;ible that the &s;train of the piece was much beyond the principles of the age, had not ventur'd to pre&s;ent it to the hou&s;e, or that it had been, for that rea&s;on, rejected by them. The dignity and authority of the commons are &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted upon in this re|mon&s;trance; and it is there &s;aid, that their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the ill treatment, which they rec$ived during the latter part of Elizabeth's reign, had pro|ceeded from their tenderne&s;s towards her age and her &s;ex. But the authors are mi&s;taken in the&s;e facts: For the hou&s;e received and &s;ubmitted to as bad treatment in the beginning and middle of that reign. The government was equally arbitrary in Mary's reign, in Edward's, in Harry the eighth and &s;eventh's. And the farther we go back in hi&s;tory, tho' there might be more of a certain irregular kind of liberty among the barons, the commons were &s;till of le&s;s authority. King James, as they them&s;elves acknowleg'd, gave the hou&s;e of commons more liberty of &s;peech, than had been indulg'd them by any of his predece&s;&s;ors.</NOTE>, but thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed and
openly avowed on the part of the prince.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit and judgment of the hou&s;e of commons
appeared, not only in defence of their own privileges,
but al&s;o in their endeavour, tho', at this time, in vain,
to free trade from tho&s;e &s;hackles, which the high exerted
prerogative, and even, in this re&s;pect, the ill-judged
tyranny of Elizabeth, had impo&s;ed upon it.</P>
<P>JAMES had already, of his own accord, called in
and annulled all the numerous patents for monopolies,
which had been granted by his predece&s;&s;or, and which
<PB N="534" REF="599">
fettered extremely every &s;pecies of dome&s;tic indu&s;try:
But the exclu&s;ive companies &s;till remained; another
&s;pecies of monopoly, by which almo&s;t all foreign trade,
except that to France, was brought into the hands of
a few rapacious engro&s;&s;ers, and all pro&s;pect of future
improvement in commerce was for ever &s;acrificed to a
little temporary advantage of the &s;overeign. The&s;e
companies, tho' arbitrarily erected, had carried their
privileges &s;o far, that the whole commerce of Eng|land
was centered in London; and it appears, that the
cu&s;toms of that port amounted to 110,000l. a-year,
while tho&s;e of all the kingdom be&s;ide yielded only
&s;eventeen thou&s;and<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Journ. 21 May, 1604.</NOTE>. Nay, the whole trade of London
was confined to about 200 citizens<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>, who were ea&s;ily
enabled, by combining among them&s;elves, to fix what|ever
price they plea&s;ed both to the exports and imports
of the nation. The committee, appointed to examine
this enormous grievance, one of the greate&s;t which we
read of in Engli&s;h &s;tory, in&s;i&s;t on it as a fact well
known and avowed, however contrary to the pre&s;ent
received opinion, that &s;hipping and &s;eamen had &s;en&s;ibly
decayed during all the preceding reign<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">A remon&s;trance from the Trinity-hou&s;e, in 1602, &s;ays, that in a little above twelve years, after 1588, the &s;hipping and number of &s;eamen in England decayed about a third part.

nothing be more common than complaints of the det
cay of commerce, even during the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing pe|riods;
yet is this a con&s;equence which might naturally
re&s;ult from &s;uch arbitrary e&s;tabli&s;hments, at a time
when the trade of all the other nations of Europe,
except that of Scotland, enjoyed full liberty and in|dulgence.</P>
<P><PB N="535" REF="600">
WHILE the commons were thus attempting to give
liberty to the trading part of the nation, they al&s;o en|deavoured
to free the landed intere&s;t from the burthen
of ward&s;hips<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Journ. 1 June, 1604.</NOTE>, and to remove tho&s;e remains of the
&s;eudal tenures, under which the nation &s;till laboured.
A ju&s;t regard was &s;hown to the crown in the whole
conduct of this affair; nor was the remedy, &s;ought
for, con&s;idered as a matter of right, but merely of grace
and favour. The profit, which the King reaped both
from wards and from re&s;pite of homage, was e&s;timated;
and it was propo&s;ed to compound for the&s;e preroga|tives
by a &s;ecure and independent revenue. But after
&s;ome debates in the hou&s;e, and &s;ome conferences with
the lords, the affair was found to contain more difficul|ties
than could ea&s;ily, at that time, be &s;urmounted;
and it was not then brought to any conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame fate attended an attempt of a like nature,
to free the nation from the burthen of purveyance; an
old prerogative in the crown, by which the officers of
the hou&s;hold were empowered to take, without con&s;ent
of the owners, provi&s;ions for the King's family, and
carts and hor&s;es for the removal of his baggage, upon
paying a &s;tated price for them. This prerogative had
been much abu&s;ed by the purveyors<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Journ. 30 April, 1604.</NOTE>; and the com|mons
&s;hewed &s;ome intention to offer the King fifty
thou&s;and pounds a-year for the abolition of it.</P>
<P>ANOTHER affair of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence was
brought before this parliament, where the commons
&s;hewed a greater &s;pirit of independence than any true
judgment of national intere&s;t. The union of the two
kingdoms was very zealou&s;ly, and even impatiently
urged by the King<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Journ. 21 April. 1 May, 1604. Parliamentary Hi&s;tory, Vol. 5. p. 91.</NOTE>. He ju&s;tly regarded it as the
peculiar felicity of his reign, that he had terminated
<PB N="536" REF="601">
the bloody animo&s;ities of the&s;e ho&s;tile nations, and
had reduced the whole i&s;land under one empire; en|joying
tranquillity within it&s;elf, and &s;ecurity from all
foreign inva&s;ions. He hoped, that, while his &s;ubjects
of both kingdoms reflected on pa&s;t di&s;a&s;ters, be&s;ides
regarding his per&s;on as infinitely precious, they would
entertain the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire of &s;ecuring them&s;elves
again&s;t the return of like calamities, by a thorough
union of laws, parliaments, and privileges. He con&s;i|dered
not, that this very reflection operated, as yet,
in a contrary manner, on men's prejudices, and kept
alive that mutual hatred between the nations, which
had been carried to the greate&s;t extremity, and required
time to allay it. The more urgent the King appeared
in promoting &s;o u&s;eful a mea&s;ure, the more backward
was the Engli&s;h parliament in concurring with him;
while they a&s;cribed his exce&s;&s;ive zeal, to that partiality,
in favour of his antient &s;ubjects, of which they thought,
that, on other occa&s;ions, they had rea&s;on to complain.
Their complai&s;ance for the King, therefore, carried
them no farther than to appoint forty-four Engli&s;h to
meet with thirty-one Scots commi&s;&s;ioners, in order to
deliberate concerning the terms of an union; but
without any power of making advances towards the

by &s;ome members who were attached to the court.
In vain was it urged, that, tho' the King received a
&s;upply, which had been voted to Elizabeth, and which
had not been collected before her death; yet he found
it burthened with a debt contracted by the Queen,
equal to the full amount of it: That peace was not
<PB N="537" REF="602">
yet thoroughly concluded with Spain, and that Ireland
was &s;till expen&s;ive to him: That on his journey from
Scotland, amid&s;t &s;uch an immen&s;e concour&s;e of people,
and on that of the Queen and royal family, he had
expended con&s;iderable &s;ums: And that, as the courtiers
had looked for greater liberalities from the Prince on his
acce&s;&s;ion, and had impo&s;ed on his generous nature;
&s;o the Prince, in his turn, would expect, at the begin|ning,
&s;ome mark of duty and attachment from his peo|ple
and &s;ome con&s;ideration of his nece&s;&s;ities. No impre&s;|&s;ion
was made on the hou&s;e of commons by the&s;e to|pics;
and the majority appeared fully determined to
refu&s;e all &s;upply. The burthen of the government,
at that time, lay &s;urpri&s;ingly light upon the people:
And that very rea&s;on, which to us, at this di&s;tance,
may &s;eem a motive for genero&s;ity, was the real cau&s;e
why the parliament was, on all occa&s;ions, &s;o remark|ably
frugal and re&s;erved. They were not, as yet, ac|cu&s;tomed
to open their pur&s;es in &s;o liberal a manner as
their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in order to &s;upply the wants of their
&s;overeign; and the &s;malle&s;t demand, however requi&s;ite,
appeared in their eyes unrea&s;onable and exorbitant.
The commons &s;eem al&s;o to have been de&s;irous of re|ducing
the crown to &s;till farther nece&s;&s;ities, by their
refu&s;ing a bill, &s;ent down to them by the lords, for
$ntailing the crown lands for ever on the King's hei$s
and &s;uccesors<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary Hi&s;t. Vol. 5. p. 108.</NOTE>. The di&s;&s;ipation, made by Elizabeth,
had probably taught him the nece&s;&s;ity of this law,
and &s;hewn them the advantage of refu&s;ing it.</P>
<P>IN order to cover a di&s;appointment, which might
bear a bad con&s;truction both at home and abroad,
James &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Journ. 26 June 1604.</NOTE>, where he told
them, that he de&s;ired no &s;upply; and he was very
<PB N="538" REF="603">
forward in refu&s;ing what was never offered him. Soon
after, he prorogued the parliament, not without di&s;|covering,
in his &s;peech, vi&s;ible marks of di&s;&s;atisfaction.
Even &s;o early in his reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of July.</NOTE> he &s;aw rea&s;on to make pub|lic
complaints of the re&s;tle&s;s and encroaching &s;pirit of
the puritanical party, and of the malevolence, with
which they endeavoured to in&s;pire the commons. Nor
were his apprehen&s;ions without rea&s;on; &s;ince the com|mons,
now finding them&s;elves free from the arbitrary
government of Elizabeth, apply'd for a conference with
the lords, and pre&s;ented a petition to the King; the
purport of both which was to procure, in favour of the
puritans, a relaxation of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws.
The u&s;e of the &s;urplice and of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m is
there chiefly complained of; but the remedy &s;eems to
be expected &s;olely from the King's di&s;pen&s;ing power<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary hi&s;tory, vol. 5. p. 98, 99, 100.</NOTE>.
The &s;ame papers di&s;cover the violent animo&s;ity of the
commons again&s;t the catholics together with the into|lerating
&s;pirit of that a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ummer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with Spain. 18th Augu&s;t.</NOTE> the peace with Spain was finally con|cluded,
and was &s;igned by the Spani&s;h mini&s;ters at Lon|don<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer tom. XVI. p. 585. &amp;c.</NOTE>. In the conferences, previous to this treaty,
the nations were found to have &s;o few claims on each

appear to have been continued more on account of per|&s;onal
animo&s;ity between Philip and Elizabeth, than
any contrariety of political intere&s;ts between their &s;ub|jects.
Some articles in the treaty, which &s;eem pre|judicial
to the Dutch commonwealth, were never exe|cuted
by the King; and as the Spaniards made no com|plaints
on that head, it appeared, that, by &s;ecret agree|ment,
the&s;e articles were under&s;tood in a different
&s;en&s;e from what they &s;eem naturally to bear, and that

the Hollanders<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. II. p. 27. p. 330, <HI>et alibi.</HI> In this re&s;pect James's peace was more honourable than that which Henry the 4th him&s;elf made with Spain. That prince &s;tipulated not to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Dutch; and the &s;upplies, which he &s;ecretly &s;ent them were in direct contravention to the treaty.</NOTE>. The Con&s;table of Ca&s;tile came into
England to ratify the peace; and on the part of Eng|land,
the Earl of Hartford was &s;ent into the Low
Countries for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and the Earl of Not|tingham,
Lord high admiral, into Spain. The train
of the latter was numerous and &s;plendid; and the
Spaniards, it is &s;aid, were extremely &s;urpri&s;ed, when
they beheld the blooming countenances and graceful
appearance of the Engli&s;h, whom their bigotry, in|flamed
by the prie&s;ts, had repre&s;ented as &s;o many mon|&s;ters
and infernal dem$$$s.</P>
<P>THO' England, by means of her naval force, was
perfectly &s;ecure, during the latter years of the Spani&s;h
war, James &s;hewed an extreme impatience to put an
end to ho&s;tilities; and &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion, before
any terms of peace were concerted or even propo&s;ed
by Spain, he recalled all the letters of marque<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">23d of June, 1603.</NOTE>, which
had been granted by Queen Elizabeth. The Arch|duke
Albert had made &s;ome advances of a like nature<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Grotii Annal. Lib. 12.</NOTE>,
which invited the King to take this friendly &s;tep. But
what is remarkable; in James's proclamation for that
purpo&s;e, he plainly &s;uppo&s;es, that, as he had him&s;elf,
while king of Scotland, always lived in amity with
Spain, peace was attached to his per&s;on, and that mere|ly
by his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England, without
any articles of treaty or agreement, he had ended the
war between the kingdoms<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See procla|mations during the fir&s;t &s;even years of K. James. Winwood vol. II. p. 65.</NOTE>. This ignorance of the

to find James, on all occa&s;ions, expre&s;s his intention

and of per&s;evering in all the rigorous mea&s;ures of Eli|zabeth.

Cate&s;by,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1605.</NOTE> a gentleman of good parts and of
an antient family, fir&s;t thought of a mo&s;t extraordinary
method of revenge; and he opened his intention to
Piercy, a de&s;cendant of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Nor|thumberland.
In one of their conver&s;ations with re|gard
to the di&s;tre&s;t condition of the catholics, Piercy
having broke into a &s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion, and mentioned
the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the King; Cate&s;by took the opportu|nity
of revealing to him a nobler and more exten&s;ive
plan of trea&s;on, which not only included a &s;ure exe|cution
of vengeance, but afforded &s;ome hopes of re|&s;toring
the catholic religion in England. In vain,
&s;aid he, would you put an end to the King's life: He
has children, who would &s;ucceed both to his crown and
to his maxims of government. In vain would you ex|tingui&s;h
the whole royal family: The nobility, the
gentry, the parliament are all infected with the &s;ame
here&s;y, and could rai&s;e to the throne another prince
and another family, who, be&s;ides their hatred to our
religion, would be animated with revenge for the tra|gical
death of their predece&s;&s;ors. To &s;erve any good
purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t de&s;troy, at one blow, the King,
the royal family, the lords, the commons; and bury
all our enemies in one common ruin. Happily, they
are all a&s;&s;embled on the fir&s;t meeting of the Parliament;
and afford us the opportunity of glorious and u&s;eful
vengeance. Great preparations will not be requi&s;ite.
A few of us, combining, may run a mine below the

flames below, there for ever to endure the torments due
to their offences<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Gunpowder Trea&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PIERCY was charmed with this project of Cate&s;by;
and they agreed to communicate the matter to a few
more, and among the re&s;t to Thomas Winter, whom
they &s;ent over to Flanders, in que&s;t of Fawkes, an
officer in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice, with who&s;e zeal and
courage they were all thoroughly acquainted. When
they inli&s;ted any new con&s;pirator, in order to bind
him to &s;ecrecy, they always, together with an oath,
employed the &s;acrament, the mo&s;t &s;acred rite of their
religion<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">State Trials vol. I. p. 190, 198, 210.</NOTE>. And 'tis remarkable, that no one of the&s;e
pious devotees ever entertained the lea&s;t compunction
with regard to the cruel ma&s;&s;acre, which they project|ed,
of whatever was great and eminent in the nation.
Some of them only were &s;tartled by the reflection,
that of nece&s;&s;ity many catholics mu&s;t be pre&s;ent; as
&s;pectators or attendants on the King, or as having
&s;eats in the hou&s;e of peers: But Te&s;mond, a je&s;uit,
and Garnet, &s;uperior of that order in England, removed
the&s;e &s;cruples, and &s;hewed them how the intere&s;ts of
religion required, that the innocent &s;hould here be &s;a|crificed
with the guilty.</P>
<P>ALL this pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;pring and &s;ummer of the
year 1604; when the con&s;pirators al&s;o hired a hou&s;e in
Piercy's name, adjoining to that in which the par|liament
was to a&s;&s;emble. Towards the end of that
year they began their operations. That they might
be le&s;s interrupted, and give le&s;s &s;u&s;picion to the neigh|bourhood,
they carried in &s;tore of provi&s;ions with them,
<PB N="544" REF="611">
and never de&s;i&s;ted from their labour. Ob&s;tinate to
their purpo&s;e, and confirmed by pa&s;&s;ion, by principle
and by mutual exhortation, they little feared death in
compari&s;on of a di&s;appointment; and having provided
arms, together with the in&s;truments of their labour,
they re&s;olved there to peri&s;h in ca&s;e of a di&s;covery.
Their per&s;everance advanced the work; and they &s;oon
pierced the wall, tho' three yards in thickne&s;s; but
on approaching the other &s;ide, they were &s;ome|what
&s;tartled with hearing a noi&s;e, which they knew
not how to account for. Upon inquiry, they found,
that it came from the vault below the hou&s;e of lords;
that a magazine of coals had been kept there; and
that, as the coals were &s;elling off, the vault would
be let to the highe&s;t bidder. The opportunity was
immediately &s;eized; the place hired by Piercy; thirty-&s;ix
barrels of powder lodged in it; the whole covered
up with faggots and billets; the doors of the cellar
boldly flung open; and every body admitted, as if it
contained nothing dangerous.</P>
<P>CONFIDENT of &s;ucce&s;s, they now began to look for|ward,
and to plan the remaining part of their project.
The King, the Queen, Prince Henry, were all expected
to be pre&s;ent at the opening of the parliament. The
Duke, by rea&s;on of his tender age, would be ab&s;ent;
and it was re&s;olved, that Piercy &s;hould &s;eize him, or
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. The Prince&s;s Elizabeth, a child like|wi&s;e,
was kept at Lord Harrington's hou&s;e in Warwick|&s;hire;
and Sir Everard Digby, Rookwood, Grant,
being let into the con&s;piracy, engaged to a&s;&s;emble their
friends, on pretence of a hunting-match, and &s;eizing
that Prince&s;s, immediately to proclaim her Queen. So
tran&s;ported were they with rage again&s;t their adver|&s;aries,
and &s;o charmed with the pro&s;pect of revenge,
that they forgot all care of their own &s;afety; and tru&s;t|ing
to the general confu&s;ion, which mu&s;t re&s;ult from
<PB N="545" REF="612" MS="Y">
&s;o unexpected a blow, they fore&s;aw not, that the fury
of the people, now unre&s;trained by any authority, mu&s;t
have turned again&s;t them, and would probably have &s;a|tiated
it&s;elf, by an univer&s;al ma&s;&s;acre of the catho|lics.</P>
<P>THE day, &s;o long wi&s;hed for, now approached, on
which the parliament was appointed to a&s;&s;emble. The
dreadful &s;ecret, tho' communicated to above twenty
per&s;ons, had been religiou&s;ly kept, during the &s;pace
of near a year and a half. No remor&s;e, no pity, no
fear of puni&s;hment, no hope of reward, had, as yet,
induced any one con&s;pirator, either to abandon the
enterprize, or make a di&s;covery of it. The holy fury
had extingui&s;hed in their brea&s;t every other motive;
and it was an indi&s;cretion at la&s;t, proceeding chiefly
from the&s;e very bigotted prejudices and partialities,
which &s;aved the nation.</P>
<P><HI>TEN days before the meeting of the parliament,
Lord Monteagle, a catholic, &s;on to Lord Morley,
received the following letter, which had been delivered
to his &s;ervant by an unknown hand.</HI> My Lord, Out
of the love I bear to &s;ome of your friends, I have a care of
your pre&s;ervation. Therefore I would advi&s;e you, as you
tender your life, to devi&s;e &s;ome excu&s;e to &s;hift off your at|tendance
at this parliament. For God and man have con|curred
to puni&s;h the wickedne&s;s of this time. And think
not &s;lightly of this adverti&s;ement; but retire your&s;elf into
your country, where you may expect the event in &s;afety.
For, tho' there be no appearance of any &s;tir, yet, I &s;ay, they
will receive a terrible blow, this parliament, and yet they
&s;hall not &s;ee who hurts them&punc; This coun&s;el is not to be
contemned, becau&s;e it may do you good, and can do you no
harm: For the danger is pa&s;t, as &s;oon as you have $urned
the letter. And I hope God will give you the grace to make
<PB N="546" REF="613">
good u&s;e of it, to who&s;e holy protection I commend
you<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">K. Jame$$s Works, p. 227.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MONTEAGLE knew not what to make of this letter;
and tho' inclined to think it a fooli&s;h attempt to fright|en
and ridicule him, he judged it &s;afe&s;t to carry it to
Lord Sali&s;bury, &s;ecretary of &s;tate. Tho' Sali&s;bury too
was inclined to give little attention to it, he thought
proper to lay it before the King who came to town a
few days after. To the King it appeared not &s;o light
a matter; and from the &s;erious earne&s;t &s;tyle of the let|ter,
he conjectured, that it implied &s;omething very
dangerous and important. A <HI>terrible blow,</HI> and yet <HI>the
authors concealed;</HI> a danger &s;o <HI>&s;udden,</HI> and yet &s;o <HI>great;</HI>
the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;eemed all to denote &s;ome contri|vance
by gun-powder; and it was thought advi&s;able
to in&s;pect all the vaults below the hou&s;es of parliament.
This care belonged to the earl of Suffolk, Lord cham|berlain;
who purpo&s;ely delayed the &s;earch, till the day
before the meeting of the parliament. He remarked
tho&s;e great piles of wood and faggots, which lay in
the vault under the upper hou&s;e; and he ca&s;t his eye
upon Fawkes, who &s;tood in a dark corner, and pa&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf for Piercy's &s;ervant. That daring and deter|mined
courage, which &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed this con|&s;pirator,
even among tho&s;e heroes in villany, was fully
painted in his countenance, and was not pa&s;&s;ed unnoti|ced
by the Lord chamberlain<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 229.</NOTE>. Such a quantity al&s;o
of fuel, for the u&s;e of one who lived &s;o little in town
as Piercy, appeared a little extraordinary<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>; and upon
comparing all circum&s;tances it was re&s;olved that a more
thorow in&s;pection &s;hould be made. About midnight,
Sir Thomas Knevet, a ju&s;tice of peace, was &s;ent with
proper attendants; and before the door of the vault,
<PB N="547" REF="614">
finding Fawkes, who had ju&s;t fini&s;hed all his prepa|rations,
he immediately &s;eized him, and turning over
the faggots, di&s;covered the powder. The matches and
every thing proper for &s;etting fire to the train were
taken in Fawkes's pocket; who finding his guilt now
apparent, and &s;eeing no refuge but in boldne&s;s and
de&s;pair, expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t regret, that he had lo&s;t
the opportunity, of firing the powder at once, and of
&s;weetening his own death by that of his enemies<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 230.</NOTE>.
Before the council, he di&s;played the &s;ame intrepid
firmne&s;s, mixt even with &s;corn and di&s;dain; refu&s;ing
to di&s;cover his accomplices and &s;hewing no concern
but for the failure of the enterprize<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. II. p. 173.</NOTE>. This ob&s;tinacy
la&s;ted two or three days: But being confined to the
Tower, left to reflect on his guilt and danger, and the
rack being ju&s;t &s;hown to him; his courage, fatigued
with &s;o long an effort, and un&s;upported by hope or &s;o|ciety,
at la&s;t failed him; and he made a full di&s;co|very
of all the con&s;pirators<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 231.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CATESBY, Piercy, and the other criminals, who
were in London, tho' they had heard of the alarm
taken at the letter &s;ent to Monteagle; tho' they had
heard of the lord chamberlain's &s;earch; yet were re|&s;olved
to per&s;i&s;t to the utmo&s;t, and never abandon their
hopes of &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Some hi&s;torians have imagined, that the King had &s;ecret intelligence of the con&s;piracy, and that the letter to Monteagle was wrote by his direction, in order to obtain the fame of penetration in di&s;covering the plot. But the known facts refute this &s;uppo&s;ition. That letter, being commonly talked of, might naturally have given and alarm to the con&s;pirators, and made them contrive their e&s;cape. The vi&s;it of the Lord chamberlain ought to have had the &s;ame effect. In &s;hort, it appears, that no body was arre&s;ted or enquired after, for &s;ome days, till Fawkes di&s;covered the names of the con&s;pirators. We may infer, however, from a letter in Winwood's Memorials, vol. II. p. 171. that Sali&s;bury's &s;agacity led the King in his conjectures, and that the mini&s;ter, like an artful courtier, gave his ma&s;ter the prai&s;e of the whole di&s;covery.</NOTE>. But at la&s;t, hearing that Fawkes
<PB N="548" REF="615">
was arre&s;ted, they hurried away to Warwick&s;hire;
where Sir Everard Digby, making account that &s;ucce&s;s
had attended his confederates, was already in arms,
in order to &s;eize the prince&s;s Elizabeth. She had

them&s;elves on their defence again&s;t the country, who
were rai&s;ed from all quarters, and armed, by the &s;heriffs.
The con&s;pirators, with all their attendants never ex|ceeded
the number of eighty per&s;ons; and being &s;ur|rounded
on every &s;ide, could no longer entertain hopes,
either of e&s;caping or prevailing. Having therefore con|fe&s;&s;ed
them&s;elves, and received ab&s;olution, they boldly
prepared for death, and re&s;olved to &s;ell their lives as
dear as po&s;&s;ible to the a&s;&s;ailants. But even this mi&s;er|able
con&s;olation was denied them. Some of their pow|der
took fire, and di&s;abled them for defence<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">State Trials vol. I. p. 199. Di&s;cour&s;e of the manner &amp;c. p. 69, 70.</NOTE>. The
people ru&s;hed in upon them. Piercy and Cate&s;by was
killed with one &s;hot. Digby, Rookwood, Winter,
and others, being taken pri&s;oners, were tried, confe&s;&s;ed
their guilt, and died, as well as Garnet, by the hands
of the executioner. Notwith&s;tanding this horrid crime,
the bigotted catholics were &s;o devoted to Garnet, that
they fancy'd miracles to be wrought by his blood<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Winwood Vol. II. p. 300.</NOTE>;

<P>NEITHER had the de&s;perate fortune of the con&s;pi|rators
urged them to this enterprize, nor had the for|mer
profligacy of their lives prepared them for &s;o great
a crime. Before that audacious attempt, their conduct
&s;eems, in general, to be liable to no reproach. Ca|te&s;by's
character had entitled him to &s;uch regard, that
Rookwood and Digby were &s;educed by their implicit
tru&s;t in his judgment; and they declared, that, from
she motive alone of friend&s;hip to him, they were ready,
<PB N="549" REF="616">
on any occa&s;ion, to have &s;acrificed their lives<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">State Trials vol. I. p. 201.</NOTE>. Digby

man in England; and he had been particularly honour|ed
with the good opinion of Queen Elizabeth<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Athen. Ox. vol. II. fol. 354.</NOTE>. 'Twas
bigotted zeal alone, the mo&s;t ab&s;urd of prejudices
ma&s;qued with rea&s;on, the mo&s;t criminal of pa&s;&s;ions
covered with the appearance of duty, which &s;educed

<P>THE Lords Mordaunt and Sturton, two catholics,
were fined, the former 10,000 pounds, the latter

parliament had begot a &s;u&s;picion of their being made
acquainted with the con&s;piracy. The Earl of Nor|thumberland
was fined 30,000 pounds, and detained
&s;everal years pri&s;oner in the Tower; becau&s;e, among
other grounds of &s;u&s;picion, he had admitted Piercy
into the number of gentlemen pen&s;ioners, without his
taking the requi&s;ite oaths<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Camden in Kennet, p. 692.</NOTE>. The&s;e &s;entences may be
thought &s;omewhat arbitrary: But &s;uch was the nature
of all proceedings in the &s;tar-chamber.</P>
<P>THE King, in his &s;peech to the parliament, ob&s;erv|ed,
that, tho' religion had engaged the con&s;pirators
in &s;o criminal an attempt, yet ought we not to involve
all the Roman catholics in the &s;ame guilt, or &s;uppo&s;e
them equally di&s;po&s;ed to commit &s;uch enormous bar|barities.
Many holy men, he &s;aid, and our ance&s;tors
among the re&s;t, had been &s;educed to concur with that
church in her &s;chola&s;tic doctrines; who yet had never
<PB N="550" REF="617">
admitted her &s;editious principles, conerning the Pope's
power of dethroning kings, or &s;anctifying a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.
The wrath of heaven is denounced again&s;t crimes,
but innocent error may obtain its favour; and nothing
can be more hateful than the uncharitablene&s;s of the
puritans, who condemn alike to eternal torments,
even the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive pro&s;elytes to popery. For
his part, he added, that con&s;piracy, however atrocious,
&s;hould never alter, in the lea&s;t, his plan of government:
While with one hand he puni&s;hed guilt; with the
other, he would &s;till &s;upport and protect innocence<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">K. James's works, p. 503, 504.</NOTE>.
After this &s;peech, he prorogued the parliament, till the
22d of January<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The Parliament this &s;e&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed an act obliging every one to take the oath of allegiance; a very moderate te&s;t, &s;ince it decided no controverted points between the two religions, and only engaged the per&s;on who took it to abjure the Pope's power of de$$roning Kings. See K. James's works, p. 2$0.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE moderation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1606.</NOTE> and, I may &s;ay, magnanimity,
of the King, immediately after &s;o narrow an e&s;cape
from a mo&s;t dete&s;table con&s;piracy, was no wi&s;e agreea|ble
to his &s;ubjects. Their animo&s;ity again&s;t popery,
even before this provocation, had ri&s;en to a great pitch;
and it had perhaps been more prudent in James, by a
little di&s;&s;imulation, to have conformed him&s;elf to it.
His theological learning, confirmed by di&s;putation, had
happily fixed his judgment in the prote&s;tant faith; yet
was his heart a little bya&s;&s;ed by the allurements of
Rome, and he had been extremely plea&s;ed, if the
making &s;ome advances could have effected an union
with that antient mother-church. He &s;trove to abate
the acrimony of his own &s;ubjects again&s;t the religion
of their fathers: He became him&s;elf the object of their
diffidence and aver&s;ion. Whatever mea&s;ures he em|braced;
in Scotland to introduce prelacy, in England
to inforce the authority of the pre&s;ent church, and
<PB N="551" REF="618">
&s;upport its rites and ceremonies; were interpreted as
&s;o many &s;teps towards popery, and were repre&s;ented by
the puritans as &s;ymptoms of idolatry and &s;uper&s;tition.
Ignorant of the con&s;equences, or unwilling to &s;acrifice
to politics his inclination, which he called his con|&s;cience,
he per&s;evered in the &s;ame mea&s;ures, and gave
tru&s;t and preferment, almo&s;t indifferently, to his catho|lic
and prote&s;tant &s;ubjects. And finding his per&s;on,
as well as his title le&s;s obnoxious to the church of
Rome, than tho&s;e of Elizabeth, he gradually abated
the rigour of tho&s;e laws, which had been enacted
again&s;t that church, and which had been enacted
again&s;t that church, and which were &s;o acceptable to
his bigotted &s;ubjects. But the effects of the&s;e di&s;po&s;iti|ons
on both &s;ides became not very &s;en&s;ible, till towards
the conclu&s;ion of his reign.</P>
<P>AT this time, James &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in &s;ome
degree, the affections even of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, and,
in a pretty high degree, their e&s;teem and regard. Hi|therto
their complaints were chiefly levelled again&s;t his
too great con&s;tancy in his early friend&s;hips; a quality,
which, had it been attended with more oeconomy, the
wi&s;e would have excu&s;ed, and the candid would even,
perhaps, have applauded. His parts, which were not
de&s;picable, and his learning, which was great, being
highly extolled by his cour$iers and gownmen, and
not yet tried in the management of any delicate affairs,
for which he was unfit, rai&s;ed a very high idea of him
in the world; nor was it always thro' flattery or in&s;in|cerity,
that he received the title of the &s;econd Solomon.
A report, which was &s;uddenly &s;pread about this time,
of his being a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, vi&s;ibly &s;truck a great con&s;ter|nation
into all orders of men<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 676.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia|ment.</NOTE> The commons al&s;o
abated, this &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;omewhat of their exce&s;&s;ive fruga|lity

<PB N="552" REF="619">
fifteenths, which, Sir Francis Bacon &s;aid in the hou&s;e<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Journ. 20 May, 1606.</NOTE>,
might amount to about four hundred thou&s;and pounds:
And for once the King and parliament parted in friend|&s;hip
and good humour. The hatred, which the ca|tholics
&s;eemed to bear him, gave him, at this time, an
additional value in the eyes of his people. The only
point, in which the commons gave him di&s;plea&s;ure, was
by di&s;covering their con&s;tant goodwill to the puritans,
in who&s;e favour they de&s;ired a conference with the
Lords<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Journ. 5 April 1606.</NOTE>: which was rejected.</P>
<P>THE aid, granted by Parliament, was payable in
four years; and the King's profu&s;ion, joined to the
nece&s;&s;ary charges of the government, had already
very much anticipated this &s;upply, and di&s;po&s;ed him to
di&s;&s;ipate, in a very little time, among his friends and
courtiers, the re&s;idue of it. To engage him farther
into expence, his brother-in-law, the King of Denmark
payed him a vi&s;it this &s;ummer; and the whole court
was employed in fea&s;ting and revelry, in ma&s;ques and
interludes<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 676.</NOTE>. Great erudition and profound morality,
with little ta&s;te or plea&s;antry, prevail in all the&s;e enter|tainments:
My&s;tery, allegory, and allu&s;ion reign
throughout. Italy was then the model for wit and
ingenuity among the European nations. France her|&s;elf,
who afterwards &s;et &s;o much better patterns of
elegance and plea&s;ure, was at that time contented to
copy &s;ervilely laboured and romantic inventions of her
&s;outhern neighbour.</P>
<P>THE chief affair which was tran&s;acted next &s;e&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November, $8.</NOTE>
was the intended union of the two kingdoms. Nothing
could exceed the King's pa&s;&s;ion and zeal for this noble
enterprize, but the parliament's prejudice and reluct|ance
again&s;t it. There remain two excellent &s;peeches
<PB N="553" REF="620">
in favour of the union, which de&s;erve to be compared
together; that of the King<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">K. James's works, p. 509.</NOTE>, and that of Sir Francis
Bacon. Tho&s;e, who affect in every thing &s;uch an
extreme contempt for James, will be &s;urpri&s;ed to find,
that his di&s;cour&s;e, both for good rea&s;oning and eloquent
compo&s;ition, approaches very near that of a man, who
was undoubtedly, at that time, one of the greate&s;t
geniu&s;es of Europe. A few trivial indi&s;cretions and
indecorums may be &s;aid to characterize the harangue
of the monarch, and mark it for his own. And in
general, &s;o open and avowed a declaration in favour
of a mea&s;ure, where he had taken no care, by any pre|caution
or intrigue, to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, may &s;afely be
pronounced a very great indi&s;cretion. But the art of
managing parliaments, by private intere&s;t or cabal,
being found hitherto of little u&s;e or nece&s;&s;ity, was not,
as yet, become a part of Engli&s;h politics. In the
common cour&s;e of affairs, government could be con|ducted
without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and when their con|currence
became requi&s;ite to the mea&s;ures of the
crown, it was, generally &s;peaking, except in times
of great faction and di&s;content, obtained without
much difficulty.</P>
<P>THE King's influence &s;eems to have rendered the
Scots parliament very cordial in all the &s;teps, which
they took towards the union. Tho' the advantages
which Scotland might hope from that mea&s;ure, were
more con&s;iderable; yet were the objections too, with
regard to that kingdom, more &s;triking and obvious.
The benefit, which mu&s;t have re&s;ulted to England,
both by acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength and &s;ecurity, was not
de&s;picable; and as the Engli&s;h were, by far, the greater
nation, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;eat of government, the ob|jections,
either from the point of honour or from jea|lou&s;y,
<PB N="554" REF="621">
could not rea&s;onably have any place among
them. The Engli&s;h parliament indeed &s;eem to have
been &s;wayed merely by the vulgar motive of national
antipathy. And thy per&s;i&s;ted &s;o ob&s;tinately in their
prejudices, that all the efforts for a thorough union
and incorporation, ended only in the abolition of the
ho&s;tile laws, formerly enacted between the king|doms<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">The commons were even &s;o aver&s;e to the union, that they had com|plained in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion to the lords of the bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, for writing a book in favour of it; and the prelate was obliged to make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions for this offence. The crime imputed to him &s;eems to have $$$&s;i&s;ted in his treating of a &s;ubject, which lay before the parliament. So little notion had they as yet of general liberty! See parliamentary hi&s;tory, vol. 5. p. 108, 109, 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME precipitant &s;teps, which the King, a little
after his acce&s;&s;ion, had taken, in order to pormote his
favourite project, had been here ob&s;erved to do more
injury than &s;ervice. From his own authority, he had
a&s;&s;umed the title of King of Great Britain; and had
quartered the arms of Scotland, with tho&s;e of Eng|land,
in all coins, flags, and en&s;igns. And he had
engaged the judges to make a declaration, that all tho&s;e,
who, after the union of the crowns, &s;hould be born
in either kingdom, were, for that rea&s;on alone, natu|ralized
in both. This was a nice que&s;tion, and, ac|cording
to the ideas of tho&s;e times, &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;ub|tile
rea&s;oning on both &s;ides. The King was the &s;ame:
The parliaments were different. To render the peo|ple
therefore the &s;ame, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that the
&s;overeign authority re&s;ides chiefly in the prince, and
that the&s;e popular a&s;&s;emblies are rather ordained to
a&s;&s;i&s;t with money and advice, than indued with any
controuling or active powers in the government. <HI>It is
evident,</HI> &s;ays Bacon in his pleadings on this &s;ubject,
<HI>that all other commonwealths, monarchies only excepted, do
<PB N="555" REF="622">
&s;ub&s;i&s;t by a law precedent. For where authority is divided
among&s;t many officers, and they not perpetual, but annual or
temporary, and not to receive their authority but by election,
and certain per&s;ons to have voices only in that election, and
the like; the&s;e are bu&s;y and curious frames, which of ne|ce&s;&s;ity
do pre&s;uppo&s;e a law precedent, written or unwrit|ten
to guide and direct them: But in monarchies, e&s;pecially
hereditary, that is, when &s;everal families or lineages of
people do &s;ubmit them&s;elves to one line, imperial or royal;
the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is more natural and &s;imple; which afterwards,
by law &s;ub&s;equent, is perfected and made more formal; but
that is grounded upon nature</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bacon's works, vol. 4. p. 190, 191. Edit. 1730.</NOTE>. It would &s;eem from this
rea&s;oning, that the idea of an <HI>hereditary, limited</HI> mon|archy,
tho' implicitly &s;uppo&s;ed in many public tran&s;|actions,
had never, as yet, been expre&s;sly formed by any
Engli&s;h lawyer or politician.</P>
<P>EXCEPT the ob&s;tinacy of the parliament with re|gard
to the union, and an attempt on the King's ec|cle&s;ia&s;tial
juri&s;diction<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Journ. 2. 2 December, 5 March, 1606, 25, 26 June, 1607.</NOTE>, mo&s;t of their mea&s;ures, during
this &s;e&s;&s;ion, were &s;ufficiently re&s;pectful and obliging;
tho' they &s;till di&s;cover a vigilant &s;pirit, and a careful
attention towards public good and national liberty.
The votes al&s;o of the commons &s;how, that that hou&s;e
contained a mixture of puritans, who had acquired
great authority among them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Journal, 26 February. 4, 7, March. 1606. 2 May, 17 June 1607.</NOTE>, and who, together
with religious prejudices, were continually &s;ugge&s;ting
ideas, more &s;uitable to a popular than a monarchical
form of government. the natural appetite for rule,
made the commons lend a willing ear to every doctrine,
which tended to augment their power and influ|ence.</P>
<P><PB N="556" REF="623">
A PETITION was moved in the hou&s;e for a more
rigorous execution of the laws again&s;t popi&s;t recu&s;ants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1607.</NOTE>
and an abatement towards prote&s;tant nonconformi&s;ts.
Both the&s;e two points were equally unacceptable to
the King; and he &s;ent orders to the hou&s;e to proceed
no farther in that matter. The hou&s;e were inclined,
at fir&s;t, to con&s;ider the&s;e orders as a breach of privilege:
But they &s;oon acquie&s;ced, when told, that this mea&s;ure

di&s;po&s;ed to make the precedents of that reign the

difference with any of their monarchs.</P>

<P>THE hou&s;e of commons began now to feel them&s;elves

<P><PB N="557" REF="624">
ABOUT this time, there was an in&s;urrection of the
country people in Northampton&s;hire, headed by one
Reynolds, a man of low condition. They went about
de&s;troying inclo&s;ures; but carefully avoided the committing
any other outrage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of July.</NOTE> This in&s;urrection was ea&s;ily
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and, tho' great lenity was u&s;ed towards the
in&s;urgents, yet were &s;ome of the ringleaders puni&s;hed.
The chief cau&s;e of that trivial commotion &s;eems to have
been, of it&s;elf, far from trivial. It was become the com|mon
practice in England to di&s;u&s;e tillage, and throw
the land into inclo&s;ures for the &s;ake of pa&s;ture. By this
means, the kingdom was depopulated, or at lea&s;t, pre|vented
from increa&s;ing &s;o much in people, as might
have been expected from the daily increa&s;e of indu&s;try
and commerce.</P>
<P>NEXT year pre&s;ents us with nothing memorable:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1608.</NOTE>
But in the &s;pring of the &s;ub&s;equent, after a long ne|gotiation,
was concluded, by a truce of twelve years,
that war, which, for near half a century, had been car|ried
on with &s;uch fury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1609.</NOTE> between Spain and the &s;tates

Spain were numbers, riches, authority, di&s;cipline:
On the &s;ide of the revo$ted provinces were found the
attachment to liberty and the enthu&s;ia&s;m of religion.
By her naval enterprizes the republic maintained her
armies; and joining peaceful indu&s;try to military va|lour,

her&s;elf, and gradually rely le&s;s or $ho&s;e neighbouring

prompted to encourage her revolt. Long had the pride

<P>THIS chief point being once gained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 30.</NOTE> the treaty was
ea&s;ily brought to a conclu&s;ion, under the joint media|tion
and guarantee of France and England. All exte|rior
appearances of honour and regard were paid equally
to both crowns: But very different were the &s;enti|ments,
which the &s;tates, as well as all Europe, enter|tained
of the princes, who wore them. Frugality and
vigour, the chief circum&s;tances, which procure regard
among foreign nations, &s;hone as con&s;picuou&s;ly in

liberty and independence. But it has &s;ince been di&s;covered by Winwood's

hopes of receiving &s;upply;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1610.</NOTE> the commons, of circum|&s;cribing
his exorbitant prerogative. The Earl of
Sali&s;bury, now created trea&s;urer on the death of the
Earl of Dor&s;et, laid open the King's nece&s;&s;ities, fir&s;t to
the Peers, then to a committee of the lower hou&s;e<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Journ. 17 Feb. 1609. Kennet, p. 681.</NOTE>.
He in&s;i&s;ted on the unavoidable expences, in &s;upporting
the navy, and in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a late in&s;urrection in Ire|land:
He mentioned three numerous courts, which
the King was obliged to maintain, for him&s;elf, for the
Queen, and for the Prince of Wales: He ob&s;erved,
that Queen Elizabeth, tho'a &s;ingle woman, had re|ceived
very large &s;upplies, in the years preceding her
death, which alone were expen&s;ive to her: And he
a&s;&s;erted, that, during her reign, &s;he had very much di&s;|&s;ipated
the crown-lands; an expedient, which, tho'
it &s;upplied her pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, without laying bur|thens
on her people, multiplied extremely the nece&s;|&s;ities
of her &s;ucce&s;&s;or. From all the&s;e cau&s;es he thought
it no-wi&s;e &s;trange, that the King's income &s;hould fall
&s;hort &s;o great a &s;um as eighty one thou&s;and pounds of
his &s;tated and regular expence; without mentioning
contingencies, which ought always to be e&s;teemed a
fourth of the yearly charges. And as the crown was
now nece&s;&s;arily burthened with a great and urgent debt
of 300,000 pounds, he thence inferred the ab&s;olute
nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate and large &s;upply from the
people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 2$&punc;</NOTE> To all the&s;e rea&s;ons, which James likewi&s;e
urged in a &s;peech addre&s;&s;ed to both hou&s;es, the commons
remained inexorable. But not to &s;hock the King with
an ab&s;olute refu&s;al, they granted him one &s;ub&s;idy and
one fifteenth; which would &s;carce amount to a hundred
thou&s;and pounds. And James received the mortifi|cation
of di&s;covering, in vain, all his wants, and of beg|ging
aid of &s;ubjects, who had no rea&s;onable indulgence
nor con&s;ideration for him.</P>
<P><PB N="560" REF="627">
AMONG the many cau&s;es of di&s;gu&s;t and quarrel,
which now daily and unavoidably multiplied between
Prince and Parliament, this article of money is to be
regarded as none of the lea&s;t con&s;iderable. After the
di&s;covery and conque&s;t of the We&s;t-Indies, gold and
&s;ilver became every day more plentiful in England, as
well as in the re&s;t of Europe; and the price of all
commodities and provi&s;ions ro&s;e to a pitch beyond what
had ever been known, &s;ince the declen&s;ion of the Ro|man
empire. As the revenue of the crown ro&s;e not
in proportion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides the great di&s;&s;ipation of the crown-lands, the fee-farm-rents never increa&s;ed, and the other lands were let on long lea&s;es and at a great undervalue, little or nothing above the old rent.</NOTE>, the Prince was in&s;en&s;ibly reduced to
poverty amid&s;t the general riches of his &s;ubjects, and
required additional funds, in order to &s;upport the &s;ame
magnificence and force, which had been maintained by
former monarchs. But while money thus flowed into
England, we may ob&s;erve, that, at the &s;ame time, and
probably from that very cau&s;e, arts and indu&s;try of all
kinds received a mighty increa&s;e; and elegance in every
enjoyment of life became better known, and more cul|tivated
among all ranks of people. The King's &s;er|vants,
both civil and military, his courtiers, his mini|&s;ters,
demanded more ample &s;upplies from the impo|veri&s;hed
Prince, and were not contented with the &s;ame
&s;implicity of living, which had &s;atisfied their ance&s;tors.
The Prince him&s;elf began to regard an increa&s;e of
pomp and &s;plendor as requi&s;ite to &s;upport the dignity
of his character, and to pre&s;erve the &s;ame &s;uperiority
above his &s;ubjects, which his predece&s;&s;ors had enjoyed.
Some equality too, and proportion to the other &s;ove|reigns
of Europe, it was natural for him to de&s;ire;
and as they had univer&s;ally enlarged their revenue and
multiplied their taxes, the King of England deemed
it rea&s;onable, that his &s;ubjects who were generally as
<PB N="561" REF="628">
rich as theirs, &s;hould bear with patience &s;ome additi|onal
burthens and impo&s;itions.</P>
<P>UNHAPPILY for the King, tho&s;e very riches, with
the increa&s;ing knowlege of the age, bred oppo&s;ite &s;en|timents
in his &s;ubjects; and begetting a &s;pirit of freedom
and independence, di&s;po&s;ed them to pay little regard,
either to the entreaties or menaces of their &s;overeign.
While the barons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their former immen&s;e pro|perty
and exten&s;ive juri&s;dictions, they were apt, on
every di&s;gu&s;t, to endanger the monarch and throw the
whole government into confu&s;ion: But this very con|fu&s;ion
often, in its turn, proved favourable to the mo|narch,
and made the nation again &s;ubmit to him, in
order to re-e&s;tabli&s;h ju&s;tice and tranquillity. After
that both the power of alienations, and the increa&s;e of
commerce had thrown the ballance of property into the
hands of the commons, the &s;ituation of affairs and the
di&s;po&s;itions of men became &s;u&s;ceptible of a more regular
plan of liberty; and the laws were not &s;upported &s;ingly
by the authority of the &s;overeign. And tho' in that
interval, after the decline of the peers, and before the
people $ad yet experienced their force, the princes a&s;|&s;umed
an exorbitant power, and had almo&s;t annihilated
the con&s;titution under the weight of their prerogative;
&s;o &s;oon as the commons recovered from their lethargy,
they &s;eem to have been a&s;toni&s;hed at the danger, and
were re&s;olved to &s;ecure liberty by firmer barriers, than
their ance&s;tors had hitherto provided for it.</P>
<P>HAD James po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very rigid frugality, he might
have warded off this cri$$ &s;omewhat longer; and wait|ing
patiently for a favourable opportunity to increa&s;e
and fix his revenue, might have &s;ecured the exten&s;ive
authority, which was tran&s;mitted to him. On the
other hand, had the commons been inclined to act with
more genero&s;ity and kindne&s;s towards their Prince, they
might probably have turned his nece&s;&s;ities to good ac|count,
<PB N="562" REF="629">
and have bribed him to depart peaceably from
the mo&s;t dangerous articles of his prerogative. But he
was a foreigner, and ignorant of the arts of popularity;
they were &s;oured by religious prejudices, and tenacious
of their money: And, in this &s;ituation, it is no won|der,
that, during this whole reign, we &s;carce find an
interval of mutual confidence and friend&s;hip between
prince and parliament.</P>
<P>THE King by his prerogative alone, had, &s;ome years
before, altered the rates of the cu&s;toms, and had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
new impo&s;itions on &s;everal kinds of merchan|dize.
This exerci&s;e of power will naturally, to us,
appear arbitrary and illegal; yet, according to the prin|ciples
and practices of that time, it might admit of
&s;ome apology. The duties of tonnage and poundage
were at fir&s;t granted to the crown, by a vote of par|liament,
and for a limited time; and as the grant fre|quently
expired and was renewed, there could not
then ari&s;e any controver&s;y concerning the origin of
the King's right to levy the&s;e duties; and this impo|&s;ition,
like all others, was plainly derived from the
voluntary con&s;ent of the people. But as Henry V.
and all the &s;ucceeding princes, had the revenue con|ferred
on them for life, the Prince, &s;o long in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the&s;e duties, began gradually to con&s;ider them
as his own proper right and inheritance, and regarded
the vote of parliament as a mere formality, which ra|ther
expre&s;&s;ed the acquie&s;cence of the people in his pre|rogative,
than be&s;towed any new gift or revenue upon
him.</P>
<P>THE Parliament, when it fir&s;t granted poundage to
the crown, had fixed no particular rates: The impo|&s;ition
was given as a &s;hilling a pound, or five <HI>per cent.</HI>
on all commodities: It was left to the King him&s;elf
and the Privy Council, aided by the advice of &s;uch mer|chants
as they &s;hould think proper to con&s;ult, to fix
<PB N="563" REF="630">
the value of goods, and thereby the rates of the cu|&s;toms:
And as that value had been &s;ettled before the
di&s;covery of the We&s;t-Indies, it was become much in|ferior
to the prices, which almo&s;t all commodities bore
in every market of Europe; and con&s;equently, the cu|&s;toms,
tho' &s;uppo&s;ed to be five <HI>per cent.</HI> did not, in
reality, amount to a third of that value. The King,
therefore, was naturally led to think, that rates, which
were now plainly fal&s;e, ought to be corrected<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Winwood, vol. II. p. 438.</NOTE>; that a
valuation of commodities, fixed by one act of the
privy council, might be amended by another; that if
his right to poundage was inherent in the crown, he
&s;hould al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s, of him&s;elf, the right of correcting
its inequalities; if it was granted by the people, he
&s;hould at lea&s;t &s;upport the &s;pirit of the law, by fixing
a new and a ju&s;ter valuation of all commodities. But
be&s;ides this rea&s;oning, which &s;eems plau&s;ible, if not
&s;olid, the King was &s;upported in that act of power by
two direct precedents, one in the reign of Mary, another
in the beginning of Elizabeth<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Journ. 1$th April, 5th and 10th May, 1614, <HI>&amp; c.</HI> 20th February, 1625.</NOTE>. Both the&s;e Prince&s;&s;es
had, without con&s;ent of parliament, altered the rates
of &s;ome particular commodities; and as their impo&s;i|tions
had, all along, been &s;ubmitted to without a
murmur, and &s;till continued to be levied, the King
had no rea&s;on to apprehend, that a farther exerci&s;e of
the &s;ame authority would give any occa&s;ion of com|plaint.
That le&s;s umbrage might be taken, he was
extremely moderate in the new rates, which he e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.
The law entitled him to levy five <HI>per cent.</HI> on
all commodities; yet he really did not, on the whole,
exceed two: The cu&s;toms, during his whole reign,
ro&s;e only from 127,000 pounds a-year to 160,000;
tho' be&s;ides the encrea&s;e of the rates, there was a &s;en|&s;ible
encrea&s;e of commerce and indu&s;try during that
<PB N="564" REF="631">
period: But all this precaution could not &s;ave him
from the complaints of the hou&s;e of commons. A
&s;pirit of liberty had now taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that hou&s;e:
The leading members, being men of an independant
genius and large views, began to regulate their opi|nions,
more by the future con&s;equences which they
fore&s;aw, that by the former precedents which were
laid before them; and they le&s;s a&s;pired at maintaining
the antient con&s;titution, than at e&s;tabli&s;hing a new one,
and a freer and a better. In their remon&s;trances to the
King on this occa&s;ion, they ob&s;erved it to be a general
opinion, <HI>That the rea&s;ons of that practice might be extend|ed
much farther, even to the utter ruin of the antient liberty
of the kingdom, and the &s;ubjects right of property in their
lands and goods</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Journ. 23d May, 1610.</NOTE>. Tho' expre&s;ly forbid by the King to
touch his prerogative, they pa&s;&s;ed a bill aboli&s;hing
the&s;e impo&s;itions; which was rejected by the hou&s;e of
lords.</P>
<P>IN another addre&s;s to the King, they objected to
the practice of borrowing upon privy &s;eals, and de&s;ired,
that the &s;ubjects &s;hould not be forced to lend money to
his Maje&s;ty, nor give a rea&s;on for their refu&s;al. Some
murmurs likewi&s;e were thrown out in the hou&s;e again&s;t
a new monopoly of the licence of wines<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Parliament. Hi&s;t vol. V. p. 241.</NOTE>. It mu&s;t
be confe&s;&s;ed, that forced loans and monopolies were
e&s;tabli&s;hed on many and recent precedents; tho' dia|metrically
oppo&s;ite to all the principles of a free go|vernment<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">We find the King's an&s;wer in Winwood's Memorials, vol.

<P>THE hou&s;e likewi&s;e di&s;covered &s;ome di&s;content
again&s;t the King's proclamations. James told them,
<PB N="565" REF="632">
That tho' he well knew, by the con&s;titution and policy of
the kingdom, that proclamations were not of equal force
with laws; yet he thought it a duty incumbent on him,
and a power in&s;eparably annexed to the crown, to re&s;train
and prevent &s;uch mi&s;chiefs and inconveniencies as he &s;aw
growing on the &s;tate, again&s;t which no certain law was
extant, and which might tend to the great detriment of the
&s;ubject, if there &s;hould be no remedy provided till the meet|ing
of a parliament. And this prerogative, <HI>he adds,</HI> our
progenitors have, as well in antient as later times, u&s;ed and
enjoyed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Parliament. Hi&s;t. vol. V. p. 250.</NOTE>. The intervals between &s;e&s;&s;ions, we may ob|&s;erve,
were frequently &s;o long as to render it requi&s;ite
for a prince to interpo&s;e by his prerogative; and it was
an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim among the lawyers, that all the
proclamations of a king were abrogated by his death<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Journ. 12th May, 1614.</NOTE>.
But what the authority could be, which bound the
&s;ubjects, and yet was inferior to the authority of laws,
&s;eems inexplicable by any maxims of rea&s;on or politics;
And in this in&s;tance, as in many others, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee,
how unintelligible the Engli&s;h con&s;titution was, before
the parliament was able, by continued acqui&s;itions or
<PB N="566" REF="633">
encroachments, to e&s;tabli&s;h it on &s;ixt principles of
liberty.</P>
<P>UPON the &s;ettlement of the reformation, that exten|&s;ive
branch of power, which regards eccle&s;ia&s;tical mat|ters,
being then without an owner, &s;eemed to belong
to the fir&s;t occupier; and Henry VIII, failed not im|mediately
to &s;eize it, and to exert it even to the utmo&s;t
degree of tyranny. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it was continued
with Edward; and recovered by Elizabeth; and that
ambitious Prince&s;s was &s;o remarkably jealous of this
flower of her crown, that &s;he &s;everely reprimanded the
parliament, if they ever pre&s;umed to intermeddle in
the&s;e matters; and they were &s;o over-awed by her
authority, as to &s;ubmit, and to a&s;k pardon on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions.
But James's parliaments were much le&s;s ob|&s;equious.
They ventured to lift up their eyes, and to
con&s;ider this prerogative. They there &s;aw a very large
province of government, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the King alone,
and never communicated with the parliament. They
were &s;en&s;ible, that this province admitted not of any
exact boundary or circum&s;cription. They had felt,
that the Roman pontiff, in former ages, under pre|tence
of religion, was gradually making advances to
u&s;urp the whole civil power. They dreaded &s;till more
dangerous con&s;equences from the claims of their own
&s;overeign, who re&s;ided among them, and who, in many
other re&s;pects, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch unlimited authority. They
therefore deemed it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to circum&s;cribe
this branch of prerogative, and accordingly, in the pre|ceding
&s;e&s;&s;ion, they pa&s;&s;ed a bill again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of any eccle&s;ia&s;tical canons without con&s;ent of
parliament<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Journ, 2d, 11th December; 5th March, 1606.</NOTE>. But the hou&s;e of lords, as is u&s;ual, de|$ended
the barriers of the throne, and rejected the
bill.</P>
<P><PB N="567" REF="634">
IN this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the commons contented them&s;elves
with remon&s;trating again&s;t the proceedings of the <HI>high
commi&s;&s;ion court</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Parliament. Hi&s;t. vol. V. p. 247. Kennet, p. 681.</NOTE>. It required no great penetration to
&s;ee the extreme danger to liberty, ari&s;ing from large
di&s;cretionary powers in a regal government. But
James, as was natural, refu&s;ed compliance with the ap|plication
of the commons. He was probably &s;en&s;ible,
that, be&s;ides the great diminution of his authority,
many inconveniences mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from the
aboli&s;hing all power of this nature in every magi&s;trate;
and that the laws, were they ever &s;o carefully framed and
dige&s;ted, could not po&s;&s;ibly provide again&s;t all contin|gencies;
much le&s;s, where they had not, as yet, attained
a &s;ufficient degree of accuracy and refinement.</P>
<P>BUT the bu&s;ine&s;s, which chiefly occupied the com|mons,
during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was the abolition of ward&s;hips
and purveyance; prerogatives, which had been more
or le&s;s touched on, every &s;e&s;&s;ion, during the whole reign
of James. In this affair, the commons employed the
proper means, which might intitle them to &s;ucce&s;s:
They offered the King a &s;ettled revenue as an equiva|lent
for the powers, which he &s;hould part with; and
the King was willing to hearken to terms. After much
di&s;pute, he offered to give up the&s;e prerogatives for
200,000 pounds a-year, which they agreed to confer
on him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">We learn from Winwood's Memorials, vol. II. p. 193, the rea&s;on a&s;|&s;igned for this particular &s;um. &startq;From thence my Lord Trea&s;urer came to the price; and here he &s;aid, that the King would no more ri&s;e and fall like a merchant. That he would not have a flower of his crown (meaning the court of wards) &s;o much to&s;&s;ed; that it was too dainty to be &s;o handled: And then he &s;aid, that he mu&s;t deliver the very coun|tenance and character of the King's mind out of his own hand-writing: which, before he read, he &s;aid he would acquaint us with a plea&s;ant con|ceit of his Maje&s;ty. As concerning the number of nine&s;core thou&s;and pounds, which was our number, he could not affect, becau&s;e nine was the number of the poets, who were always beggars, tho' they &s;erved &s;o many mu&s;es; and eleven was the number of the apo&s;tles, when the traitor, Judas, was away; and therefore might be&s;t be affected by his Maje&s;ty: But there was a mean number, which might accord us both; and <HI>that was ten:</HI> which, &s;aid my Lord Trea&s;urer, is a &s;acred number; for &s;o many were God's commandments, which tend to virtue and edifi|cation.&endq; If the commons really voted 20,000 pounds a year more, on account of this <HI>plea&s;ant conceit</HI> of the King and the Trea&s;urer, it was cer|tainly the be&s;t paid wit, for its goodne&s;s, that ever was in the world.</NOTE>. And nothing remained, towards clo&s;ing the
<PB N="568" REF="635">
bargain, but that the commons &s;hould determine the
funds, from which this &s;um &s;hould be levied. This
&s;e&s;&s;ion was too far advanced to bring &s;o difficult a mat|ter
to a full conclu&s;ion; and tho' the parliament met
again, towards the end of the year, and re&s;umed the
que&s;tion, they were never able to terminate an affair,
which they &s;eemed &s;o intent upon. The journals of
that &s;e&s;&s;ion are lo&s;t; and, as the hi&s;torians of this reign
are very negligent in relating parliamentary affairs, of
who&s;e importance they were not &s;ufficiently appri&s;ed,
we know not exactly the rea&s;on of this failure. It
only appears, that the King was extremely di&s;&s;atisfied
with the conduct of the parliament, and &s;oon after|wards
di&s;&s;olved it. This was his fir&s;t parliament, and
it &s;at near &s;even years.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of all the&s;e attacks, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s
violent, on royal prerogative, the King di&s;played, as
openly as ever, all his exalted notions of monarchy
and the authority of princes. Even in a &s;peech to the
parliament, where he begged for &s;upply, and where he
&s;hould naturally have u&s;ed every art to ingratiate him|&s;elf
with that a&s;&s;embly, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e
terms; &startq;I conclude, then, the point, touching the
power of kings, with this axiom of divinity, that,
as to di&s;pute <HI>what God may do,</HI> is bla&s;phemy, but
<HI>what God wills,</HI> that divines may lawfully and do
ordinarily di&s;pute and di&s;cu&s;s; &s;o is it &s;edition in

<PB N="569" REF="636">
of his power. But ju&s;t kings will ever be willing to
declare what they will do, if they will not incur
the cur&s;e of God. I will not be content, that

age, the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions would probably give &s;ome offence.
But we may ob&s;erve, that, as the King's de&s;poti&s;m was
more &s;peculative than practical, &s;o the independency of
the commons was, at this time, the contrary; and,
tho' &s;trongly &s;upported by their pre&s;ent &s;ituation as well
as di&s;po&s;ition, was too new and recent to be as yet
founded on &s;y&s;tematical principles and opinions<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">It may not be unworthy ob&s;ervation, that James, in a Book called <HI>The true Laws of free Monarchies,</HI> which he publi&s;hed a little before his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England, affirmed, &startq;That a good king, altho' he be above the law, will &s;ubject and frame his actions thereto, for example's &s;ake to his &s;ubjects, and of his own free-will, but not as &s;ubject or bound thereto.&endq; In another pa&s;&s;age, &startq;According to the fundamental law already alleged, we daily &s;ee, that in the parliament (which is nothing el&s;e but the head-court of the king and his va&s;&s;als) the laws are but craved by his &s;ubjects, and only made by him at their rogation, and with their advice. For albeit the king <HI>make daily</HI> &s;tatutes and ordinances, enjoining &s;uch pains thereto as he thinks meet, without any advice of parliament or e&s;tates; yet it lies in the power of no parliament to make any kind of law or &s;tatute, without his &s;ceptre be to it, for giving it the force of a law.&endq; <HI>King James's Works,</HI> p. 202. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, at &s;uch a critical juncture, James had &s;o little fen&s;e as, directly, in &s;o material a point, to have openly &s;hocked what were the univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of that age: On the contrary, we are told by hi&s;torians, that nothing tended more to facilitate his ac|ce&s;&s;ion, than the good opinion entertained of him by the Engli&s;h, on ac|count of his learned and judicious writings. The que&s;tion, however, with regard to the royal power was, at this time, become a very dangerous point; and without employing ambiguous, in&s;ignificant terms, which determined nothing, it was impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e both King and parliament. Dr. Cowell, who had magnified the prerogative in words too intelligible, &s;ell this &s;e&s;&s;ion under the indignation of the commons. <HI>Parliament. Hi&s;t.</HI> vol. V. p. 221. The King him&s;elf, after all his magnificent boa&s;ts, was obliged to make his e&s;cape thro' a di&s;tinction, which he framed between a king <HI>in ab&s;tracto</HI> and a king <HI>in concreto:</HI> An ab&s;tract king, he &s;aid, had all power; but a concrete king was bound to ob&s;erve the laws of the country, which he governed. <HI>K. James's Works,</HI> p. 533. But, how bound? By con&s;cience only? Or might his &s;ubjects re&s;i&s;t him and defend their pri|vileges? This he thought not fit to explain. And &s;o difficult is it to ex|plain that point, that, to this day whatever liberties may be u&s;ed by private inquirers, the laws have, very prudently, thought proper to maintain a total $$$ence with regard to it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="570" REF="637">
THIS year was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a memorable event,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of May. Death of the French King.</NOTE>
which gave great alarm and concern in England; the
murder of the French monarch by the poniard of
the fanatical Ravaillac. That experience, and repu|tation,
which this heroie prince had been acquiring for
&s;o many years; tho&s;e trea&s;ures, which he had ama&s;&s;ed;
tho&s;e armies, which he had inli&s;ted and di&s;ciplined;
were on the point of being employed in &s;ome great
enterprize, which would probably have changed the
face of Europe; when a period was put to his glory
by an enthu&s;ia&s;tic madman, who &s;acrificed at once his
own life and that of the prince to his dete&s;table pre|judices.
Were the de&s;igns, a&s;cribed to Henry by the
compilers of Sully's Memoirs, le&s;s chimerical, they
might be admitted, on account of the te&s;timony, by
which that narration is &s;upported: But &s;uch va&s;t pro|jects,
had they been real, he mu&s;t have revolved and
dige&s;ted in his mind for many years; and 'tis ob&s;erv|able,
that about a twelve-month before, he had been
very in&s;trumental in making peace between Spain and
the United Provinces; a mea&s;ure, by which he deprived
him&s;elf of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his firme&s;t ally, and the be&s;t
able to &s;econd his enterpri&s;es. 'Tis more probable, that
the war, which, at the time of his death, he intended
to commence again&s;t Spain, was the re&s;ult of ambition,
revenge, or love, in a powerful and military prince,
who had long wi&s;hed for an opportunity of attacking
<PB N="571" REF="638">
his enemy, and who was at la&s;t rou&s;ed by a &s;udden motive
or provocation. With his death, the glory of the
French monarchy &s;uffered an eclip&s;e for &s;ome years;
and that kingdom falling under an admini&s;tration weak
and bigotted, factious and di&s;orderly, the Au&s;trian
greatne&s;s began anew to appear formidable to Europe.</P>
<P>IN England, the antipathy to the catholics revived a
little upon this tragical event; and &s;ome of the laws,
which had been formerly enacted for no other purpo&s;e
than to keep the&s;e religioni&s;ts in awe, began now to
be executed with greater rigour and &s;everity<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 684.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' James's timidity and indolence fixed him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1611.</NOTE>
during mo&s;t of his reign, in a very prudent inattention
to foreign affairs, there happened, this year, an event
in Europe of &s;uch mighty con&s;equence as to rouze him
from his lethargy, and &s;ummon up all his zeal and en|terprize.
A profe&s;&s;or of divinity, named Vor&s;tius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Armini|ani&s;m.</NOTE>
the di&s;ciple of Arminius, was called from a German
to a Dutch univer&s;ity; and as he differed from his
Britannic Maje&s;ty in &s;ome nice que&s;tions concerning
the intimate e&s;&s;ence and &s;ecret decrees of God, he was
con&s;idered as a dangerous rival in &s;chola&s;tic fame, and
was, at la&s;t, obliged to yield to the legions of that
royal doctor, who&s;e &s;yllogi&s;ms he might have refuted
or eluded. If vigour was wanting in other incidents
of James's reign, here he behaved even with haughti|ne&s;s
and in&s;olence; and the &s;tates were obliged, after
&s;everal remon&s;trances, to deprive Vor&s;tius of his chair,
and to bani&s;h him their dominions<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 715.</NOTE>. The King
carried no farther his pro&s;ecutions again&s;t that profe&s;&s;or;
tho' he had very charitably hinted to the &s;tates,
<HI>That, as to the burning Vor&s;tius for his bla&s;phemies and
athei&s;m, he left them to their own chri&s;tian wi&s;dom; but
&s;urely never heretic better de&s;erved the flames</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">K. James's Works, p. 355.</NOTE>. It is to
<PB N="572" REF="639">
be remarked, that, at this period, all over Europe, ex|cept
in Holland alone, the practice of burning here|tics
&s;till prevailed, even in prote&s;tant countries; and
in&s;tances were not wanting in England, during the
reign of James. The Dutch them&s;elves were, at
la&s;t, by &s;tate intrigue, and the tyranny of Prince Mau|rice,
forced from their rational and humane maxims;
and the per&s;ecuting bigots, a little after this time, &s;ig|nalized
their power by the death of the virtuous Barne|velt,
and the impri&s;onment of the virtuous and learned
Grotius. The &s;chola&s;tic controver&s;ies about free-will,
and grace, and prede&s;tination, begot the&s;e violent con|vul&s;ions.</P>
<P>IN
tracing the coherence among the &s;y&s;tems of mo|dern
theology, we may ob&s;erve, that the doctrine of
ab&s;olute decrees has ever been intimately connected
with the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit; as that doctrine affords
the highe&s;t &s;ubject of joy, triumph, and &s;ecurity, to the
&s;uppo&s;ed elect, and exalts them, by infinite degrees,
above the re&s;t of mankind. All the fir&s;t reformers
adopted the&s;e principles; and the Jan&s;eni&s;ts too, a
fanatical &s;et in France, not to mention the Mahome|tans
in A&s;ia, have ever embraced them. As the Lu|theran
e&s;tabli&s;hments were &s;ubjected to epi&s;copal juri&s;|diction,
their enthu&s;ia&s;tic genius gradually decayed,
and men had lei&s;ure to perceive the ab&s;urdity of &s;up|po&s;ing
God to puni&s;h, by infinite torments, what he
him&s;elf, from all eternity, had unchangeably decreed.
The King, tho', at this time, his Calvini&s;tic educa|tion
had rivetted him in the doctrine of ab&s;olute de|crees,
yet, being a zealous partizan of epi&s;copacy, was
in&s;en&s;ibly ingaged, towards the end of his reign, to
favour the milder theology of Arminius. Even in &s;o
great a doctor, the genius of the religion prevailed over
its &s;peculative tenets; and with him, the whole clergy
gradually dropped the more rigid principles of ab&s;olute
<PB N="573" REF="640">
reprobation and unconditional decrees. Some noi&s;e
was, at fir&s;t, made about the&s;e innovations; but being
drowned in the fury of factions and civil wars which
&s;ucceeded, the &s;chola&s;tic arguments made an in&s;igni|ficant
figure amid&s;t tho&s;e violent di&s;putes about civil and
eccle&s;ia&s;tical power with which the nation was agitated.
And upon the re&s;toration, the church, tho' &s;he &s;till
retained her old &s;ub&s;criptions and articles of faith, was
found to have totally changed her &s;peculative doctrines,
and to have embraced tenets more &s;uitable to the
genius of her di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip, without its
being po&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign the preci&s;e period, in which the
alteration was produced.</P>
<P>IT may be worth ob&s;erving, that, about this time,
James, from his great de&s;ire to promote controver&s;ial
divinity, erected a college at Chel&s;ea for the entertain|ment
of twenty per&s;ons, who &s;hould be entirely employ|ed
in refuting the papi&s;ts and puritans<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 685. Camden's Brit. vol. I. p. 370. Gib&s;on's edit.</NOTE>. All the ef|forts
of the great Bacon could not procure an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
for the cultivation of natural philo&s;ophy: Even
to this day, no &s;ociety has been in&s;tituted for the po|li&s;hing
and fixing our language. The only encourage|ment,
which the &s;overeign in England has ever given
to any thing, that has the appearance of &s;cience, was
this &s;hort-lived e&s;tabli&s;hment of James; an in&s;titution
quite &s;uperfluous, con&s;idering the unhappy propen&s;ion,
which, at that time, &s;o univer&s;ally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the nation
for polemical divinity.</P>
<P>TO con&s;ider James in a more advantageous light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1612.</NOTE>
we mu&s;t take a view of him as the legi&s;lator of Ireland;
and mo&s;t of the in&s;titutions, which he had framed for
the civilizing that kingdom, being fini&s;hed about this
period, it may not here be improper to give &s;ome ac|count
<PB N="574" REF="641">
of them. He frequently boa&s;ts of the manage|ment
of Ireland as his ma&s;ter-piece; and it will ap|pear,
upon inquiry, that his vanity, in this particular,
was not altogether without foundation.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;ubjection of Ireland by Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Ireland.</NOTE> the
more difficult ta&s;k &s;till remained; to civilize the bar|barous
inhabitants, to reconcile them to laws and in|du&s;try,
and to render their &s;ubjection durable and u&s;eful
to the crown of England. James proceeded in this
work by a &s;teady, regular, and well concerted plan;
and in the &s;pace of nine years, according to Sir John
Davis, he made greater advances towards the reforma|tion
of that kingdom, than had been made in the 440
years, which had elap&s;ed &s;ince the conque&s;t was fir&s;t
attempted<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P. 259. edit. 1613.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to aboli&s;h the Iri&s;h cu|&s;toms,
which &s;upplied the place of laws, and which
were calculated to keep that people for ever in a &s;tate
of barbari&s;m and di&s;order.</P>
<P>BY the <HI>Brehon</HI> law or cu&s;tom, every crime, how|ever
enormous, was puni&s;hed, not with death, but by
a fine or pecuniary mulct, which was levied upon the
criminal. Murder it&s;elf, as among all the antient
barbarous nations, was attoned for in this manner;
and each man, according to his rank, had a different
rate or value affixed to him, which, if any one was
willing to pay, he needed not fear the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating his
enemy. This rate was called his <HI>eric.</HI> When Sir
William Fitzwilliams being Lord deputy, told Ma|guire,
that he was to &s;end a &s;heriff into Fermannah,
which, a little before, had been made a county, and
&s;ubjected to the Engli&s;h law; <HI>Your &s;heriff,</HI> &s;aid Ma|guire,
<HI>&s;hall be welcome to me: But, let me know, before|hand,
his</HI> eric, <HI>or the price of his head, that, if my people
<PB N="575" REF="642">
cut it off, I may levy the money upon the county</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sir John Davis, p. 166.</NOTE>. As
for oppre&s;&s;ion, extortion, and other tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, &s;o little
were they regarded, that no penalty was affixed to
them, and no redre&s;s for &s;uch offences could ever be
obtained.</P>
<P>THE cu&s;toms of <HI>Gavelkinde</HI> and <HI>Tani&s;try</HI> were at|tended
with the &s;ame ab&s;urdity in the di&s;tribution of
property. Upon the death of any per&s;on, his land,
by the cu&s;tom of Gavelkinde, was divided among all
the males of the &s;ept or family, both ba&s;tard and legi|timate:
And, after partition made, if any of the &s;ept
died, his portion was not &s;hared out among his &s;ons;
but the chieftain, at his di&s;cretion, made a new par|tition
of all the lands, belonging to that &s;ept, and
gave every one his &s;hare<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sir John Davis, p. 167.</NOTE>. As no man, by rea&s;on of
this cu&s;tom, enjoyed the fixed property of any land;
to build, to plant, to inclo&s;e, to cultivate, to improve,
would have been &s;o much lo&s;t labour.</P>
<P>THE chieftains and the Tani&s;ts, tho' drawn from
the principal families, were not hereditary, but were
e&s;tabli&s;hed by election, or, more properly &s;peaking, by
force and violence. Their authority was ab&s;olute;
and, notwith&s;tanding that certain lands were a&s;&s;igned to
the office, its chief profit re&s;ulted from exactions, dues,
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, for which there was no fixed law, and
which were levied at plea&s;ure<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 173.</NOTE>. Hence aro&s;e that com|mon
bye-word among the Iri&s;h, <HI>That they dwelt we&s;t|ward

AFTER aboli&s;hing the&s;e Iri&s;h cu&s;toms, and &s;ub&s;titut|ing
Engli&s;h law in their place; James, having taken
all the natives under his protection, and declared them
free citizens, proceeded to govern them by a regular
admini&s;tration, military as well as civil.</P>
<P>A &s;ufficient army was maintained, its di&s;cipline in|&s;pected,
and its pay tran&s;mitted from England, in order
to keep the &s;oldiers from preying upon the country, as
had been u&s;ual in former reigns. When Odoghartie
rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection, a reinforcement was &s;ent over,
and the flames of that rebellion were immediately ex|tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>ALL minds being fir&s;t quieted by an univer&s;al in|demnity<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 263.</NOTE>; circuits were e&s;tabli&s;hed, ju&s;tice admini&s;tred,

kind &s;everely puni&s;hed<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 264, 265, &amp;c.</NOTE>. As the Iri&s;h had been uni|ver&s;ally
engaged in the rebellion again&s;t Elizabeth, a
re&s;ignation of all the rights, which had been formerly
granted them to &s;eparate juri&s;dictions, was rigorou&s;ly
exacted; and no authority, but that of the King and
the law, was permitted throughout the kingdom<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 276.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A re&s;ignation of all private e&s;tates was even required;
and when they were re&s;tored, the proprietors received
them under &s;uch conditions as might prevent, for the
future, all tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion over the common
people. The value of the dues, which the nobles u&s;u|ally
claimed from their va&s;&s;als, was e&s;timated at a fixed
&s;um, and all further arbitrary exactions prohibited under
&s;evere penalties<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Sir John Davis, p. 278.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE whole province of Ul&s;ter having fallen to the
crown by the attainder of rebels, a company was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in London, for planting new colonies in that
fertile country: The property was divided into mo|derate
&s;hares, the large&s;t not exceeding 2000 acres:
<PB N="577" REF="646">
Tenants were brought over from England and Scot|land:
The Iri&s;h were removed from the hills and fa&s;t|ne&s;&s;es,
and &s;ettled in the open country: Hu&s;bandry
and the arts were taught them: A fixed habitation
&s;ecured: Plunder and robbery puni&s;hed: And, by
the&s;e means, Ul&s;ter, from being the mo&s;t wild and di&s;|orderly
province of all Ireland, &s;oon became the be&s;t

Turner, a fencing-ma&s;ter. The Engli&s;h nation, who
were generally di&s;&s;atisfied with the Scots, were enraged
at this crime, equally mean and atrocious; but James
