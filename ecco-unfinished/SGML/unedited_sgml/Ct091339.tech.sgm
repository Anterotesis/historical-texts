<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>
had occa&s;ion, in writing on <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI>
to con&s;ider its connexion with <HI>Genius.</HI>
The attention which he be&s;towed on this
latter faculty, in that one point of view,
convinced him, that its Nature and its
Principles admitted and required a fuller
inve&s;tigation than had ever been at|tempted,
and determined him to enter
on that inve&s;tigation immediately after
fini&s;hing his former work. Accordingly
his plan was formed, the fir&s;t part com|po&s;ed,
and &s;ome progre&s;s made in the
&s;econd part, &s;o long ago as the year
1758. He was then in an office which
favoured enquiries of this nature; his
continuance in it would have afforded
him the opportunity of compleating the
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
de&s;ign in a &s;hort time; and the indul|gent
reception given by the Public to his
<HI>E&s;&s;ay on Ta&s;te</HI> would have encouraged
him to it: but being &s;oon after removed
to an office which nece&s;&s;arily directed
his chief attention to &s;ubjects of a dif|ferent
kind, and fully occupied his time,
he has been able to pro&s;ecute his de|&s;ign,
with long and frequent interrup|tions,
only as the immediate duties of
his profe&s;&s;ion allowed him lei&s;ure. In|tervals
of &s;uch lei&s;ure have put it in his
power to reduce his thoughts to the form
in which they now appear. The <HI>&s;ubject</HI>
is curious; of the <HI>execution</HI> the Public
are the proper judges.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON
GENIUS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is remarked by tho&s;e who have con&s;i|dered
the &s;tate of human knowlege with
greate&s;t attention, that the &s;ubjects of
men's enquiries have been, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, de|termined
by accident, and not pur&s;ued with
regular application, according to their dignity
or their natural connexion. On this account,
&s;ome &s;ubjects of the greate&s;t importance have
been totally neglected, and many more have
been imperfectly examined, and pro&s;ecuted
no farther than &s;uperficial ob&s;ervations &s;pon|taneou&s;ly
occurred, and ca&s;ual inclination di&s;|po&s;ed
men to attend to them. This has hap|pened
in all the &s;ciences, but e&s;pecially in the
<PB N="2" REF="9">
&s;cience of human nature. It has &s;eldom
been explored with that care which is requi|&s;ite
in a &s;ubject &s;o &s;ubtile and ab&s;tru&s;e. Far
from taking a complete &s;urvey of this curious
region, men have &s;atisfied them&s;elves with
&s;ome random incur&s;ions, vi&s;iting only a few
tracts which happened to engage their curio|&s;ity,
and penetrating even into the&s;e, only &s;o
far as &s;ome pre&s;ent view required.</P>
<P>ALL the &s;ame cau&s;es which produce &s;uch a
&s;uperficial and fortuitous method of inve&s;tiga|tion
with regard to other &s;ubjects, produce it
likewi&s;e with regard to the human mind:
and &s;ome circum&s;tances render our enquiries
on this &s;ubject, &s;light and accidental, which
do not extend their influence to the others.
The phenomena of the mind have not &s;o great
&s;teddine&s;s of exi&s;tence, as the qualities of bo|dies.
It is impo&s;&s;ible to make experiments &s;o
purpo&s;ely on the under&s;tanding or the pa&s;|&s;ions,
to pur&s;ue them &s;o deliberately, or to
repeat them &s;o ea&s;ily, as on material things.
It is nece&s;&s;ary to catch appearances as they
happen to di&s;cover them&s;elves, either imme|diately
to a man's own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, or by
their effects in the conduct or conver&s;ation of
<PB N="3" REF="10">
other men. For this rea&s;on it requires long
time, favourable opportunities, and ince&s;&s;ant
attention, to collect &s;uch a number of facts
concerning any of the mental powers, as will
be &s;ufficient for deducing conclu&s;ions concern|ing
them, by a ju&s;t and regular induction.</P>
<P>THIS difficulty which attends the inve&s;tiga|tion
of the principles of human nature, has
contributed much to check the progre&s;s of
men's enquiries concerning them, and to pre|vent
&s;ome of the mo&s;t important of them from
being at all profe&s;&s;edly analy&s;ed. Genius
it&s;elf, the leading faculty of the mind, the
grand in&s;trument of all inve&s;tigation, has
&s;carce ever been examined with care. In the
writings of tho&s;e who treat with greate&s;t ac|curacy
of the intellectual powers, we find
only a few incidental ob&s;ervations concerning
Genius. It is confe&s;&s;ed to be a &s;ubject of ca|pital
importance, without the knowlege of
which a regular method of invention cannot
be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and u&s;eful di&s;coveries mu&s;t
continue to be made, as they have generally
been made hitherto, merely by chance. But
it is reckoned a &s;ubject which can be reduced
to no fixt or general principles; its phenome|na
<PB N="4" REF="11">
are almo&s;t univer&s;ally regarded as anoma|lous
and inexplicable. It is however worth
while to enquire, whether this be really the
ea&s;e, and to make an attempt at lea&s;t, to ex|plain
the nature and varieties of Genius from
the &s;imple qualities of the human mind.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="5" REF="12">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Nature of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be proper to begin our enquiries,
by a&s;certaining, what it is that properly
con&s;titutes Genius as di&s;tingui&s;hed from our
other intellectual powers. This will both
render our conception of it preci&s;e, and lead
us to di&s;cover, what other operations of the
under&s;tanding, attend it in its exertions, or
a&s;&s;i&s;t it, and in what manner.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Province and Criterion of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>THE powers of the human mind, how|ever
di&s;tinct in them&s;elves, are gene|rally
complicated in their energies. Scarce
any of them can be exerted in perfection,
without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of many others. On
this account, it is very difficult to collect the
phenomena which belong to each, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
preci&s;ely one faculty from the re&s;t, and
to a&s;certain its peculiar nature and province.
<PB N="6" REF="13">
The habit of confounding our mental powers
with one another, is &s;o &s;trong as to render the
clo&s;e&s;t attention nece&s;&s;ary for making a &s;epa|ration;
and the natural &s;ubtlety of the &s;ub|ject
makes it hard to reflect upon it with clo&s;e
attention. But without determining, in this
manner, the proper nature of each faculty,
and marking its real difference from tho&s;e
which mo&s;t re&s;emble it and are often combin|ed
with it, our conception of it will be im|perfect
and indeterminate.</P>
<P>THE exertions of Genius can never be com|plete
or regular, when any of the intellectual
powers is remarkably defective. It receives
a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them all. But Genius is not|with&s;tanding
<HI>one</HI> of the intellectual powers,
and di&s;tingui&s;hable from the re&s;t. There are
many productions which are far from &s;atisfy|ing
rea&s;on, or altogether approving them&s;elves
to ta&s;te, in which we yet acknowlege con&s;pi|cuous
marks of real genius. Their faults
di&s;cover a defect, not of this, but of &s;ome
other power. Few competent judges will
now-a-days a&s;&s;ert that the dialectics of Ari&s;|totle,
are of any con&s;iderable utility for the
end which he propo&s;ed to an&s;wer by them,
the di&s;covery of truth: but that work, per|haps
<PB N="7" REF="14">
more than any other of his works, di&s;|plays
the compa&s;s of his genius. It will be
generally allowed that the writings of Shake|&s;pear
have almo&s;t as great faults as beauties;
but it will be as generally a&s;&s;erted, that his
genius is &s;o original and immen&s;e as to place
him at the head of modern poets. What then
is the preci&s;e criterion of genius? If we can
determine what it is, we &s;hall the more ea&s;ily
form a di&s;tinct conception of the nature of
this faculty.</P>
<P>THE difficulty in determining the province
of genius, which ari&s;es from the natural in|tricacy
and mutual connexion of the intellec|tual
powers, is increa&s;ed by the confu&s;ed ap|plication
of names, to which that has given
occa&s;ion. Genius is confounded, not only by
the vulgar, but even &s;ometimes by judicious
writers, with mere capacity. Nothing how|ever
is more evident, than that they are to|tally
di&s;tinct. A capacity of learning, is very
general among mankind. As birds are by
nature made fit for flying, a hor&s;e for the
cour&s;e, or a wild bea&s;t for fiercene&s;s, &s;o doci|lity
is congenial to man. A human creature
in every re&s;pect unteachable, were one of the
greate&s;t and rare&s;t of mon&s;ters. Mo&s;t chil|dren
<PB N="8" REF="15">
promi&s;e &s;ome abilities, though the want
of culture and other cau&s;es often bla&s;t them,
and fru&s;trate the kind intentions of Nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sicut aves ad volatum, equi ad cur&s;um, ad &s;aevitiam ferae gignuntur: ita nobis propria e&s;t mentis agitatio, atque &s;olertia.&mdash;Hebetes vero et indociles non magis &s;ecundum na|turam hominis eduntur, quam prodigio&s;a corpora, et mon&s;tris in&s;ignia: &s;ed hi pauci admodum. Fuerit argumentum, quod in pueris clucet &s;pes plurimorum: quae cum emoritur aetate, manife&s;tum e&s;t non naturam defeci&s;&s;e, &s;ed curam. QUINTIL. <HI>In&s;titut. Orat.</HI> lib. i. cap. 1.</NOTE>.
Mere capacity, in mo&s;t &s;ubjects, implies no|thing
beyond a little judgment, a tolerable
memory, and con&s;iderable indu&s;try. But true
genius is very different, and much le&s;s fre|quent.</P>
<P>GENIUS is properly the faculty of <HI>inven|tion;</HI>
by means of which a man is qualified
for making new di&s;coveries in &s;cience, or for
producing original works of art. We may
a&s;cribe ta&s;te, judgment, or knowlege, to a
man who is incapable of invention; but we
cannot reckon him a man of genius. In order
to determine, how far he merits this charac|ter,
we mu&s;t enquire, whether he has di&s;co|vered
any new principle in &s;cience, or invent|ed
any new art, or carried tho&s;e arts which
are already practi&s;ed, to a higher degree of
perfection, than former ma&s;ters? Or, whe|ther,
<PB N="9" REF="16">
at lea&s;t, he has, in matters of &s;cience,
improved on the di&s;coveries of his predece&s;|&s;ors,
and reduced principles formerly known,
to a greater degree of &s;implicity and con&s;i&s;t|ence,
or traced them through a train of con|&s;equences
hitherto unknown? Or, in the
arts, de&s;igned &s;ome new work, different from
tho&s;e of his predece&s;&s;ors, though not perhaps
excelling them? Whatever falls &s;hort of
this, is &s;ervile imitation, or a dull effort of
plodding indu&s;try, which, as not implying in|vention,
can be deemed no proof of genius,
whatever capacity, &s;kill, or diligence it may
evidence. But if a man &s;hows invention, no
intellectual defects which his performance
may betray, can forfeit his claim to genius.
His invention may be irregular, wild, undi&s;|ciplined;
but &s;till it is regarded as an infalli|ble
mark of real natural genius: and the <HI>de|gree</HI>
of this faculty, that we a&s;cribe to him,
is always in proportion to our e&s;timate of the
novelty, the difficulty, or the dignity of his
inventions.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations, when barely mention|ed,
are &s;o agreeable to our natural &s;entiments,
that a long illu&s;tration of them would be &s;u|perfluous.
They would be amply confirmed
<PB N="10" REF="17">
by an examination of the characters of tho&s;e
whom the voice of all ages has pronounced
mo&s;t eminent for genius, and of the particu|lar
grounds on which this eminence has been
a&s;&s;igned them. But a few examples &s;hall
&s;uffice in &s;o clear a ca&s;e.</P>
<P>ALL the ancients who are mo&s;t celebrated
for genius in the greater kinds of poetry, ei|ther
invented &s;ome new &s;pecies, or brought a
&s;pecies already invented, to higher perfection;
or at lea&s;t produced compo&s;itions di&s;tingui&s;hed
from tho&s;e of others, by a diver&s;ity of &s;ub|ject,
or by a peculiar and original manner.
Ae&s;chylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, not only
compo&s;ed &s;everal tragedies, by which they
di&s;played invention, in the contrivance of the
fable, in imagining incidents, in forming cha|racters,
in conceiving &s;entiments adapted to
them; but each of them made &s;ome con&s;ider|able
improvements in the con&s;truction of the
drama<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Tragedias <HI>primus</HI> in lucem Ae&s;chylus protulit.&mdash;Sed <HI>longe clarius</HI> illu&s;traverunt hoe opus Sophocles atque Euripides. QUINTIL. <HI>In&s;t. Orat.</HI> lib. x. cap. 1.

HOR. <HI>Ars Poet.</HI> ver. 278.</NOTE>. The genius of Homer has been
<PB N="11" REF="18">
always held in veneration. His Iliad, his
Ody&s;&s;ey, and even his more trivial produc|tions,
di&s;play &s;o much of rich and original
invention in almo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible way, as
would have &s;ecured to the author an acknow|legement
of very uncommon genius, though
he had lived in the mo&s;t enlightened age, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all advantages for improving his
natural talents. But our idea of his inven|tion
is immen&s;ely rai&s;ed, when we con&s;ider,
that he lived in times of ignorance, when
poetry remained almo&s;t in its fir&s;t rudene&s;s;
that he had no model, by which he could di|rect
his conceptions, or from which he could
receive &s;o much as a hint of his grand de|&s;igns;
and that he notwith&s;tanding, merely
by the force of his own abilities, brought the
noble&s;t &s;pecies of poetry all at once to its ju&s;t
perfection, and comprehended al&s;o in his works,
the rudiments of every other &s;pecies of com|po&s;ition,
<PB N="12" REF="19">
the &s;eeds from which, in Ari&s;totle's
judgment<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>, &s;ucceeding writers reared both
tragedy and comedy, and from which, in the
opinion of Quintilian<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hic (quemadmodum ex oceano dicit ip&s;e amnium vim, fontiumque cur&s;us initium capere) omnibus eloquentiae parti|bus exemplum et <HI>ortum</HI> dedit. <HI>In&s;tit. Orat.</HI> lib. x. cap. 1.</NOTE>, even orators might
produce all the virtues of their art. On ac|count
of original and exten&s;ive invention,
thus amazingly di&s;played, his title to the fir&s;t
rank of genius, has been acknowleged by all
capable and impartial judges. The Eneid is
perhaps more correct and faultle&s;s than the
Iliad; but few have pretended that Virgil is
the greater poet. He does not &s;how &s;uch co|pious
and boundle&s;s invention, as his ma&s;ter.
Be&s;ides, Virgil derives from imitation, many
things for which Homer is indebted &s;olely to
his own penetration. Were we to compare
the Eneid with Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, merely in re|&s;pect
of the genius which they manife&s;t, we
might ju&s;tly prefer Milton to Virgil. For
though we know that Milton was perfectly
<PB N="13" REF="20">
well acquainted both with the Mantuan and
with Homer, had the works of both in his
eye, and &s;crupled not to imitate them; yet
the nature of his plan, and the peculiarity of
many of the incidents and characters in his
poem, require greater and more original in|vention,
than there was room for di&s;playing
in a &s;ubject &s;o &s;imilar to Homer's, as that of
the Eneid is. It will be generally allowed,
that Shake&s;pear is, in point of genius, &s;upe|rior
to Milton. The preference ari&s;es from
the &s;uperiority of his invention. In the lower
accompli&s;hments of a poet, he is often defec|tive:
but the richne&s;s of his de&s;criptions, the
multiplicity and ju&s;tne&s;s of his characters; the
variety, the compa&s;s, and the propriety of
his &s;entiments, bear the deepe&s;t marks of their
being original: and at the &s;ame time that the
internal excellences of his works di&s;play a lux|uriance
of invention, we know that his edu|cation
gave him but &s;lender opportunities of
being acquainted with tho&s;e ancient ma&s;ters,
from whom he could have borrowed any of
his beauties, or by who&s;e example he could
have even improved his natural powers.
There were many Engli&s;h rhymers before the
time of Chaucer; but he is ju&s;tly reckoned
<PB N="14" REF="21">
the father of Engli&s;h poetry, becau&s;e he fir&s;t
di&s;played invention in any con&s;iderable de|gree.
If it were nece&s;&s;ary to multiply ex|amples
on this head, we might &s;how that in
all the arts, invention has always been re|garded
as the only criterion of Genius. Even
wildne&s;s and extravagance of invention, &s;ome|times
procures higher prai&s;e, than the utmo&s;t
nicety and correctne&s;s. We a&s;cribe &s;o great
merit to invention, that on account of it, we
allow the arti&s;t who excels in it, the privilege
of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, and would
&s;carce wi&s;h even the redundancies of his na|tural
force and &s;pirit to be lopt off by culture:
this, we are afraid, might check the vigour
of his invention, which we reckon &s;o capital
an excellence, that nothing could make
amends for the want of it.</P>
<P>IN &s;cience too, as well as in the arts, inven|tion
is the proper province of Genius, and its
only certain mea&s;ure. Socrates owes his re|putation
for genius, to his being the inventor
of moral philo&s;ophy, and of a peculiar and
proper manner of communicating it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.

<P>IT is acknowleged that the Greeks receiv|ed
the beginnings of their knowlege in philo|&s;ophy
and mathematics, from the Egyptians;
but there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that among the
Egyptians, the&s;e &s;ciences were in a very im|perfect
&s;tate: it is certain that the earlie&s;t
Greek philo&s;ophers learned, in Egypt, only
the fir&s;t elements of mathematics. In Greece,
the &s;ciences made rapid progre&s;s, and reached
a very high degree of improvement. If the
Egyptians were the inventors, this proves
them to be ingenious; but the Greeks &s;hewed
them&s;elves to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uperiour genius, and
are acknowleged to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, for
greater invention was nece&s;&s;ary for the perfec|tion
to which they ro&s;e. Arts and &s;ciences
have been known to the Chine&s;e for many
ages, held in the highe&s;t veneration, and &s;tu|died
with great ardor; yet they have not
gone beyond the elements of mo&s;t of them.
This is an evidence that real genius is not
frequent among them. They are defective in
<PB N="26" REF="33">
invention; they have &s;ome lucky ideas, but
they are incapable of pur&s;uing them.</P>
<P>IT is worth while to remark, that &s;ome|times
we are nece&s;&s;arily liable to error in
comparing the genius of different authors,
from the impo&s;&s;ibility of our a&s;certaining, in
many ca&s;es, the degree of invention which
truly belongs to them. At one time we may
reckon that original, which is only imitation,
or even a &s;ervile copy; at another, what we
brand with the&s;e epithets of reproach, may
be really invention. This circum&s;tance is
often of peculiar di&s;advantage to modern au|thors;
and it leads us, perhaps, to a&s;cribe
greater genius to the ancients, than they are
entitled to. The former are accu&s;ed of bor|rowing
from their predece&s;&s;ors, many prin|ciples,
&s;entiments, or images, for which they
are indebted &s;olely to their own genius. In
the latter, every thing is reckoned original,
becau&s;e we know not, who had occupied it
before. We can form no objection again&s;t
the olde&s;t authors extant, for the works of
tho&s;e who wrote before them, are long &s;ince
lo&s;t. Ari&s;totle had not, even in his time, the

in &s;ome degree di&s;plays its creative power.
It does not, like memory, profe&s;&s;edly copy
its ideas from preceding perceptions of &s;en&s;e,

exhibits them as independent exi&s;tences pro|duced

in &s;ome very peculiar ca&s;es, its power
extends not even to the formation of a &s;imple

<P>IMAGINATION is &s;till more inventive in all
its other operations. It can lead us from a
perception that is pre&s;ent, to the view of
many more, and carry us through exten&s;ive,
di&s;tant, and untrodden fields of thought. It
can dart in an in&s;tant, from earth to heaven,

the greate&s;t ea&s;e and celerity, through the
whole compa&s;s of nature, and even beyond its
utmo&s;t limits. It can tran&s;po&s;e, vary, and

in &s;leep, when the &s;en&s;es are locked up, and

the traces of it may not be &s;o obvious at fir&s;t

<P>JUDGMENT, in which we comprehend <HI>rea|&s;on,</HI>
from the compari&s;on of ideas and &s;en&s;a|tions,
di&s;covers relations which are not the
objects of &s;en&s;e. But many &s;ubjects admit of
the mo&s;t copious invention, where the things
invented are not relations. Whatever influ|ence,
therefore, judgment may have in &s;ome
kinds of invention, and however nece&s;&s;ary for
perfecting the operations of Genius in every
kind, its a&s;&s;i&s;tance may be, it cannot be reck|oned
properly the inventive power, as there
are many objects of invention, to which it
has not an immediate re&s;pect. Be&s;ides, even
in &s;cience, where relations are what we want
to di&s;cover, judgment cannot &s;earch out or
<PB N="33" REF="40">
bring into view, the perceptions that are to
be compared. They mu&s;t be &s;ugge&s;ted by
&s;ome other power, as we have occa&s;ion for
them; and till they are &s;ugge&s;ted, judgment
has nothing about which it may employ it&s;elf;
it mu&s;t remain inactive, and can make no
compari&s;on or deduction. Its &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s is,
to ob&s;erve the relations of tho&s;e perceptions
with which it is &s;upplied by &s;en&s;e, memory,
or imagination, and to produce conviction by
its exertion.</P>
<P>OF all the kinds of judgment, <HI>rea&s;on</HI> has
mo&s;t the appearance of an inventive power,
as it not only perceives the connexion of the
&s;everal parts of a proof, but al&s;o infers the
conclu&s;ion from all the parts together. Mr.
Locke analy&s;es rea&s;on into two powers, Saga|city,
and Illation; and a&s;cribes to it four
different exerci&s;es. &startq;The fir&s;t and highe&s;t
degree of rea&s;on, &s;ays he, is the di&s;cover|ing
and finding out of proofs; the &s;econd,
the regular and methodical di&s;po&s;ition of
them, and laying them in a clear and fit
order, to make their connexion and force
be plainly and ea&s;ily perceived; the third
is, the perceiving their connexion; and
the fourth, a making a right conclu|&s;ion.

<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay concerning Human Under&s;tanding. B. iv. c. 17. &sect; 2, 3.</NOTE>.&endq; He might have ju&s;tly given
this as an enumeration of all the &s;teps which
the <HI>mind</HI> takes in the di&s;covery of new con|clu&s;ions:
But they are not all to be a&s;cribed
to <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> The fir&s;t of them, the finding out
of ideas or experiments which may &s;erve for
proofs, is the province, not of rea&s;on, but of
imagination. It is imagination likewi&s;e, that
can be mo&s;t properly &s;aid to order and di&s;po&s;e
the proofs. It arranges them in a certain
di&s;po&s;ition; then rea&s;on &s;urveys them, and
examines, whether this di&s;po&s;ition is &s;uch as
can enable it to perceive their connexion. If
it does not, rea&s;on rejects that di&s;po&s;ition;
and imagination is again &s;et a working, ar|ranges
them in a different manner, and con|tinues
to vary the di&s;po&s;ition, till it either
&s;ugge&s;ts one which rea&s;on finds &s;ufficient for
its purpo&s;e, or till, after having wandered
through all the arrangements of its materials
that occur to it, it is wearied with the repeti|tion
of un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts, and gives over
the work as de&s;perate and impracticable. The
di&s;po&s;ition, therefore, of the proofs mu&s;t be
a&s;cribed to imagination, though rea&s;on always
<PB N="35" REF="42">
follows in its foot-&s;teps, keeps pace with it,
and recalls it when it has made an u&s;ele&s;s ex|cur&s;ion.
It follows, that the two la&s;t opera|tions
which Locke a&s;&s;igns to rea&s;on, are the
only ones which properly and &s;trictly belong
to it. Its bu&s;ine&s;s is, to perceive the connex|ion
or force of the proofs, after they are di|&s;covered
and arranged; and from the whole
train of them to infer a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion. This
is performed by every man who learns a
&s;cience from the writings or in&s;tructions of
others. It mu&s;t be performed before a per|&s;on
can comprehend a demon&s;tration in Eu|clid,
or the proof of any conclu&s;ion in philo|&s;ophy.
It implies, not genius, but mere
capacity; and is daily accompli&s;hed by mul|titudes
who are not able to make any original
di&s;covery in the &s;ciences. Indeed, without
this, no invention in &s;cience can be <HI>compleat|ed;</HI>
but without an imagination capable of
finding out and ordering the proofs, no inven|tion
could be even <HI>begun.</HI> The chief diffi|culty
in inventing new truths, regards that
part which is the work of imagination, the
di&s;covering of fit intermediate ideas, or appo|&s;ite
experiments, and the di&s;po&s;ing of them
in &s;uch a manner that they may lead to ju&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="43">
and important conclu&s;ions. It is this that
requires genius, and is regarded as its proper
province. The re&s;t demands, not invention,
but the &s;ame abilities which are nece&s;&s;ary for
apprehending the di&s;coveries of other men.
A per&s;on may be able to perceive, with the
greate&s;t ea&s;e and certainty, the connexion
and force of proofs which are pre&s;ented to
him in due order, who could not have con|trived
or arranged the&s;e proofs. He may
po&s;&s;e&s;s rea&s;on in perfection, and yet be totally
de&s;titute of invention, originality, and ge|nius<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">In this enumeration, we have not mentioned <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> a faculty which confe&s;&s;dly has great influence on genius. The rea&s;ons will readily occur. It influences only &s;ome kinds of genius, not all the kinds; but we have here confined our&s;elves to the con&s;ideration of genius in general.

<P>FROM the&s;e ob&s;ervations, it would appear,
that genius of every kind derives its imme|diate
origin from the imagination. Mere
imagination, it is true, will not con&s;titute
genius. If fancy were left entirely to it&s;elf,
it would run into wild caprice and extrava|gance,
unworthy to be called invention. A
<PB N="37" REF="44">
man who throws out indige&s;ted notions,
contradictory po&s;itions, trite and vulgar &s;en|timents,
or fooli&s;h whim&s;ies, is not &s;aid to
have invented them, but is rather blamed for
not having avoided them. As fancy has an
indirect dependence both on &s;en&s;e and me|mory,
from which it receives the fir&s;t ele|ments
of all its conceptions, &s;o when it exerts
it&s;elf in the way of genius, it has an imme|diate
connexion with judgment, which mu&s;t
con&s;tantly attend it, and correct and regulate
its &s;ugge&s;tions. This connexion is &s;o inti|mate
that a man can &s;carce be &s;aid to have
invented till he has exerci&s;ed his judgment<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ego porro ne inveni&s;&s;e quidem credo eum, qui non ju|dicavit: nec&punc; enim contraria, communia, &s;tulta inveni&s;&s;e dicitur qui&s;quam, &s;ed non vita&s;&s;e. QUINT. <HI>In&s;t. Orat.</HI> lib. iii. cap. 3.</NOTE>.
But &s;till it is true that imagination invents,
and judgment only &s;crutinizes and determines
concerning what it has invented. It is ima|gination
that produces genius; the other in|tellectual
faculties lend their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to rear
the offspring of imagination to maturity. It
is al&s;o true, that in matters of &s;peculation,
imagination re&s;igns its di&s;coveries into the
hands of rea&s;on, &s;ooner than in the arts, and
leaves it more to fini&s;h. Yet it always &s;up|plies
<PB N="38" REF="45">
the &s;ubject on which rea&s;on is to work.
Without judgment, imagination would be
extravagant; but without imagination, judg|ment
could do nothing. A bright and vigo|rous
imagination joined with a very moderate
judgment, will produce genius, incorrect, it
may be, but fertile and exten&s;ive: but the
nice&s;t judgment unattended with a good ima|gination,
cannot be&s;tow a &s;ingle &s;park of
genius. It will form good &s;en&s;e, it will en|able
a man to perceive every defect and error
in the di&s;coveries of others; but it cannot
qualify him for &s;upplying the&s;e defects, or
for being him&s;elf the author of any new in|vention.
A man of mere judgment, is e&s;&s;en|tially
different from a man of genius. The
former can employ his rea&s;on only on &s;ubjects
that are provided by others; but the latter
can provide &s;ubjects for him&s;elf. This abi|lity
is owing &s;olely to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a com|prehen&s;ive
imagination, which the former
wants.</P>
<P>IT is the imagination, therefore, with its
operations and laws, that we mu&s;t e&s;pecially
examine, in order to explain the nature of
Genius. The other faculties which a&s;&s;i&s;t it,
particularly judgment, which is more inti|mately
<PB N="39" REF="46">
connected with it than any of the re&s;t,
will need to be con&s;idered, but are to be re|garded

<P>WHEN memory pre&s;ents ideas, it an|nexes
to them a conviction that the
ideas them&s;elves, or the objects from which
they are copied, were formerly perceived;
and it exhibits the ideas in the &s;ame form and
order in which the things them&s;elves appear|ed.
In time remembrance fails, ideas are
perceived without being referred to any prior
&s;en&s;ations of their originals, the order of the
parts is forgotten. But even then, ideas do
not lie in the mind without any connexion or
dependence. Imagination can connect them
by new relations. It knits them together by
other ties than what connected the real things
from which they are derived; and often be|&s;tows
an union upon ideas who&s;e archetypes
had no relation. In this operation, it is far
from being capricious or irregular, but for
the mo&s;t part ob&s;erves general and e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="40" REF="47">
rules. There are certain qualities which ei|ther
really belong, or at lea&s;t are &s;uppo&s;ed to
belong to all the ideas that are a&s;&s;ociated by
the imagination. The&s;e qualities mu&s;t be
con&s;idered as, by the con&s;titution of our na|ture,
rendering ideas fit to be a&s;&s;ociated. It
is impo&s;&s;ible to give a rea&s;on, why the&s;e qua|lities
unite ideas: it is not nece&s;&s;ary at pre|&s;ent
to explain particularly what they are.
Experience informs us, that the influence of
a&s;&s;ociation is very great. By means of it,
multitudes of ideas originally di&s;tinct and un|connected,
ri&s;e always in company, &s;o that
one of them cannot make its appearance,
without introducing all the re&s;t. On this
account, human thought is perfectly re&s;tle&s;s.
It requires no labour to run from one idea to
others. We have &s;o great a propen&s;ity to do
it, that no re&s;olution has force enough to re|&s;train
us from it, nor will the &s;tronge&s;t efforts
be able to confine us long to the contempla|tion
of a &s;ingle idea. We are ince&s;&s;antly

<P>ASSOCIATION being an operation of fancy,

darkne&s;s. But &s;uch tran&s;ient blazes do not
nece&s;&s;arily imply real genius. It is &s;omething
more permanent and uniform. It requires a
peculiar vigour of a&s;&s;ociation. In order to
produce it, the imagination mu&s;t be compre|hen&s;ive,
regular, and active.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="49">
GENIUS implies &s;uch <HI>comprehen&s;ivene&s;s</HI> of
imagination as enables a man, on every occa|&s;ion,
to call in the conceptions that are nece&s;|&s;ary
for executing the de&s;igns or compleating
the works in which he engages. This takes
place, when the a&s;&s;ociating principles are
&s;trong, and fit for acting in an exten&s;ive
&s;phere. If they be weak, they will call in
memory to their aid. Unable to guide our
&s;teps in an unknown country, they keep in
the roads to which we have been accu&s;tomed;
and are directed in &s;ugge&s;ting ideas, by the
connexions which we remember. Every pro|duction
of a man who labours under this de|bility
of mind, bears evident marks of barren|ne&s;s,
a quality more oppo&s;ite to true genius
than any other. Nothing appears in it un|common
or new; every thing is trite and
unoriginal. Or, if he attempts to quit the
beaten path, and &s;tart new game, he can
find out but a few ideas, he is exhau&s;ted by a
&s;hort excur&s;ion, and mu&s;t either make a &s;top,
or return to the tracks of memory. Indu&s;try
endeavouring, in this manner, to &s;upply the
want of a copious imagination, by accurate
remembrance or diligent ob&s;ervation, will
produce, in&s;tead of a philo&s;opher, a devoted
<PB N="43" REF="50">
follower, or a dull laborious commentator;
in&s;tead of a poet, a &s;ervile imitator, or a
painful tran&s;lator. But when the a&s;&s;ociating
principles are vigorous, imagination, con&s;ci|ous
as it were of its own &s;trength, &s;allies
forth, without needing &s;upport or a&s;king
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, into regions hitherto unexplored,
and penetrates into their remote&s;t corners,
unfatigued with the length of the way. In
a man of genius, the power of a&s;&s;ociation is
&s;o great, that when any idea is pre&s;ent to his
mind, it immediately leads him to the con|ception
of tho&s;e that are connected with it.
No &s;ooner almo&s;t is a de&s;ign formed, or the
hint of a &s;ubject &s;tarted, than all the ideas
which are requi&s;ite for compleating it, ru&s;h
into his view as if they were conjured up by
the force of magic. His daring imagination
traver&s;es all nature, and collects materials fit
for his purpo&s;e, from all the mo&s;t di&s;tant
corners of the univer&s;e; and pre&s;ents them
at the very in&s;tant when they become u&s;eful
or nece&s;&s;ary. In con&s;equence of this, he
takes in a comprehen&s;ive view of every &s;ub|ject
to which his genius is adapted.</P>
<P>THUS, when the a&s;&s;ociating principles are
&s;trong and have an exten&s;ive influence, they
<PB N="44" REF="51">
naturally form, in proportion to the degree
of their &s;trength, that boundle&s;s fertility, that
inexhau&s;tible copiou&s;ne&s;s of invention, which
is not only one nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in true
genius, but the fir&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential con|&s;tituent
of it. The &s;malle&s;t production will
in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;cover, in what extent this
power is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. A work of real genius
always proclaims, in the cleare&s;t manner,
that immen&s;e quantities of materials have
been collected by fancy, and &s;ubjected to the
author's choice. There is no particular, per|haps,
in the works of Homer, that has been
more univer&s;ally remarked and admired,
than the prodigious compa&s;s of imagination,
which they &s;how. His penetration has gain|ed
him acce&s;s to all the magazines of ideas,
and enabled him to draw materials from every
part of nature, and from the whole circle of
human arts. Knowlege of them was pre|requi&s;ite,
but could have been of no &s;ervice
after it was obtained, without the livelie&s;t
fancy, &s;ugge&s;ting them readily, and applying
them on &s;uitable occa&s;ions. A comprehen&s;ive
imagination gave Newton &s;o great command
over the natural and the intellectual world,
that, in his philo&s;ophical enquiries, he mi&s;&s;es
<PB N="45" REF="52">
no experiment which is nece&s;&s;ary for pro|moting
his inve&s;tigation, and, in his mathe|matical
re&s;earches, di&s;covers every idea which
can be a proper medium for inferring his
conclu&s;ion, and includes in his problems
almo&s;t every ca&s;e that can occur.</P>
<P>THIS exten&s;ive compa&s;s of thought enables
a man to derive from his own trea&s;ure, what
they who want it, are indebted for to the
works of others. He who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth a fertile
imagination, is under no nece&s;&s;ity of arrogat|ing
to him&s;elf the di&s;coveries of others, or of
adorning his own productions with the beau|ties
which he has pilfered from them. He
will not decline to u&s;e, on proper occa&s;ions,
the inventions of his predece&s;&s;ors, either in
&s;cience or in the arts; but in u&s;ing them, he
will di&s;play his own genius. He will at lea&s;t
pre&s;erve the full &s;pirit of the original, not
contented with merely tran&s;mitting its form:
the propriety with which the imitation or the
theory is introduced, and the force, with
which it is applied, will &s;how that it was not
merely copied from memory, but appo&s;itely
&s;ugge&s;ted by a vigorous imagination: and
frequently he will give farther proof of ge|nius,
by improving on the borrowed hint,
<PB N="46" REF="53">
by adding new beauties, or delivering a known
truth with greater elegance and ju&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>GENIUS implies <HI>regularity,</HI> as well as
comprehen&s;ivene&s;s of imagination. Regula|rity
ari&s;es in a great mea&s;ure from &s;uch a turn
of imagination as enables the a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciples,
not only to introduce proper ideas,
but al&s;o to connect the de&s;ign of the whole
with every idea that is introduced. When
the de&s;ign is &s;teddily kept in view, and the
mind &s;o formed as to be &s;trongly affected by
that a&s;&s;ociating quality by which the de&s;ign
is related to the means of executing it, the
imagination can &s;carce fail of being regular
and correct. Any conception that is pre&s;ent,
will introduce mo&s;t readily tho&s;e ideas which
are related to the main de&s;ign, as well as to
it&s;elf, though there &s;hould be a thou&s;and
others bearing the &s;ame relation to it&s;elf, but
unconnected with the general &s;ubject. The&s;e
latter have only one tie, but the former have
a double relation, and will therefore ru&s;h into
the thoughts with double violence. They
will occur and be ob&s;erved, while the re&s;t ne|ver
come into view, or, if they make their
appearance, are rejected &s;o quickly that we
in&s;tantly forget our ever having thought of
<PB N="47" REF="54">
them. No &s;ooner does the imagination, in
a moment of wandering, &s;ugge&s;t any idea not
conducive to the de&s;ign, than the conception
of this de&s;ign breaks in of its own accord,
and, like an antagoni&s;t mu&s;cle, counteracting
the other a&s;&s;ociation, draws us off to the
view of a more proper idea.</P>
<P>IN this manner an attachment to the de|&s;ign
naturally produces that regularity of
imagination, that capacity of avoiding fo|reign,
u&s;ele&s;s, and &s;uperfluous conceptions,
at the &s;ame time that none nece&s;&s;ary or pro|per
are pa&s;&s;ed by, which is always mo&s;t per|fect
in the greate&s;t geniu&s;es, and con&s;titutes
no incon&s;iderable part of their excellence.
As acutene&s;s of &s;mell carries a dog along the
path of the game for which he &s;earches, and
&s;ecures him again&s;t the danger of quitting it,
upon another &s;cent: &s;o this happy &s;tructure
of imagination leads the man of genius into
tho&s;e tracks where the proper ideas lurk, and
not only enables him to di&s;cover them, but,
by a kind of in&s;tinctive infallibility, prevents
him from turning a&s;ide to wander in impro|per
roads, or to &s;pend his time in the con|templation
of unappo&s;ite ideas. As the bee
extracts from &s;uch flowers as can &s;upply
<PB N="48" REF="55">
them, the juices which are proper to be con|verted
into honey, without lo&s;ing its labour
in &s;ipping tho&s;e juices which would be perni|cious,
or in examining tho&s;e vegetables which
are u&s;ele&s;s; &s;o true genius di&s;covers at once
the ideas which are conducive to its purpo&s;e,
without at all thinking of &s;uch as are unne|ce&s;&s;ary
or would ob&s;truct it. The extent of
Homer's imagination is not more remarkable
than its regularity. Poets of inferiour genius
would have comprehended a hi&s;tory of the
Trojan war in one of his poems, and all the
events of the life of Uly&s;&s;es in the other:
but his correct imagination admits no detail
incon&s;i&s;tent with the unity of the fable<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">This is remarked particularly by Ari&s;totle, as one of Homer's chief and di&s;tingui&s;hing virtues. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>,
no &s;hining epi&s;ode that can be deemed uncon|nected
with the &s;ubject, nor a &s;ingle image
un&s;uitable to the nature of his work. In the
writings of Newton, we &s;carce find any ob|&s;ervation
that is &s;uperfluous, any experiment
who&s;e force is fully implied in any other,
<PB N="49" REF="56">
any que&s;tion or problem which has not &s;ome|thing
peculiar.</P>
<P>NEITHER fertility nor regularity of ima|gination
will form a good genius, if the one
be disjoined from the other. If fertility be
wanting, the correcte&s;t imagination will be
confined within narrow bounds, and will be
very &s;low in its operations; there can be no
penetration or copious invention. If regula|rity
be ab&s;ent, an exuberant invention will
lo&s;e it&s;elf in a wilderne&s;s of its own creation.
There is a fal&s;e fertility, which ari&s;es from a
di&s;ordered and irregular fancy. As the &s;ame
idea bears &s;ome relation to an infinite num|ber
of other ideas, the a&s;&s;ociating principles
may lead us, after a very few &s;teps, to &s;uch
ideas as are connected with the la&s;t that was
pre&s;ent, yet have no connexion either with the
former ones, or with the main de&s;ign. A
man, therefore, who follows any a&s;&s;ociation,
however trivial or devious, that hits his fancy,
may &s;how a great deal of imagination without
di&s;playing any real genius. The imagination
produces abundance of glaring, brilliant
thoughts; but not being conducive to any fixt
de&s;ign, nor organized into one whole, they
can be regarded only as an abortion of fancy,
<PB N="50" REF="57">
not as the legitimate progeny of genius. A
multitude of ideas, collected by &s;uch an ima|gination,
form a confu&s;ed chaos, in which in|con&s;i&s;tent
conceptions are often mixt, concep|tions
&s;o un&s;uitable and di&s;proportioned, that
they can no more be combined into one regu|lar
work, than a number of wheels taken
from different watches, can be united into
one machine. Were it nece&s;&s;ary to produce
in&s;tances of a fruitful imagination unproduc|tive
of true genius, we might find enough
among tho&s;e pretenders to poetry, who can,
through many lines, run from one &s;hining
image to another, and fini&s;h many harmo|nious
periods, without any &s;entiment or de|&s;ign;
or among tho&s;e pretenders to &s;cience,
who can devi&s;e a hundred experiments, coin|ciding
in all their material circum&s;tances,
without a view to any conclu&s;ion, and with|out
advancing u&s;eful knowledge a &s;ingle &s;tep.
Such imagination is like a tree &s;o overcharged
with fruit, that no part of it can come to full
maturity.</P>
<P>BUT even when a fal&s;e luxuriance of fancy
does not extingui&s;h true genius, it very much
dimini&s;hes its force and beauty. Sometimes
it overloads every &s;ubject with a &s;uperfluity of
<PB N="51" REF="58">
illu&s;tration or of ornament, which either
wearies by introducing prolixity, or dazzles
too much to give entire &s;atisfaction. A painter
who indulges this exuberance of fancy, will
multiply figures which increa&s;e the compo|&s;ition
of his work without adding to its ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
which embarra&s;s the &s;pectator with|out
having any &s;hare in the action, and which
&s;eem to be introduced only that they may
aukwardly fill up an empty &s;pace upon the
canvas. Marini, &s;ays a French critic<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cavalier Marin ne s'e&s;t jamais veu une imagination plus fertile ne moin$ reglie que la &s;ienne. S$il parle d'un ro&s;&s;ignol on d'un ro&s;e, il en dit tout ce qu'on en pet imaginer; bien lain de rejetter ce qui &s;e pre&s;ente, il va chercher ce qui ne &s;e pre&s;ente pas, il $pui&s;e toujours &s;on &s;ujet. 4 <HI>Entret. d' Ari&s;t$ et $word$.</HI></NOTE>, if
he mentions a nightingale or a ro&s;e, &s;ays
every thing on the &s;ubject that he can ima|gine;
far from rejecting any idea that oc|curs
to him, he goes in &s;earch of &s;uch as can|not
naturally occur; he always lavi&s;hes on
his &s;ubject, every thing that can be thought
or &s;aid. Sometimes luxuriance of imagina|tion
produces an irregular conduct in works
of genius, carrying the author every now
and then out of &s;ight of his de&s;ign, into di|gre&s;&s;ions
which have a very &s;lender connexion
<PB N="52" REF="59">
with it. This is remarkably exemplified in
Ario&s;to. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great readine&s;s and
quickne&s;s of genius; his inventions are &s;ur|pri&s;ingly
various; but that vivacity and agi|lity
of fancy from which he derives the&s;e
virtues, has betrayed him into continual di&s;|order
and incoherence, and unnatural inter|ruptions
of his &s;tory. The <HI>Fairy Queen</HI> di&s;|covers
inexhau&s;tible richne&s;s of invention,
but is chargeable with the like irregularity.
It would be po&s;&s;ible to bring in&s;tances of
both the&s;e kinds of vicious redundance from
the writings of a very great philo&s;opher; we
might point out many pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>The E&s;&s;ay
on Human Under&s;tanding,</HI> in which Mr. Locke
has indulged both a tedious diffu&s;ene&s;s in the
illu&s;tration of his &s;ubjet, and un&s;ea&s;onable
digre&s;&s;ions from it.</P>
<P>A MAN is &s;ometimes &s;o entirely under the
power of accidental a&s;&s;ociations, that he &s;eems
&s;carce to have propo&s;ed any end, but to have
de&s;igned to begin with one idea, to go from
that to any other which it happened by any
means to &s;ugge&s;t, and &s;o from this to others,
yielding up the mind to follow pa&s;&s;ively what|ever
a&s;&s;ociations chance to affect it. This is
in an eminent degree the ca&s;e of Montaigne
<PB N="53" REF="60">
in many of his e&s;&s;ays. He &s;ays ju&s;tly of
him&s;elf, &startq;What are the&s;e e&s;&s;ays of mine but
grote&s;ques and mon&s;trous pieces of patch|work,
put together without any certain
figure, or any order, connexion, or pro|portion,
but what is accidental<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Liv. i. ch. 27.</NOTE>?&endq; This
&s;tyle of compo&s;ition, carried to the utmo&s;t de|gree
of incoherence, has been lately intro|duced:
novelty, along with a great degree
of wit, humour, and fine feelings, procured
the fir&s;t attempt con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s; and this
&s;ucce&s;s has rai&s;ed a multitude of in&s;ipid imi|tators.
It is only uncommon merit in the
parts, that can gain indulgence to &s;uch writ|ings:
the total want of de&s;ign is an e&s;&s;ential
defect, and &s;hows a capital imperfection in
the genius of the writer, an irregularity of
imagination.</P>
<P>THERE is in the human mind a &s;trong
propen&s;ity to make excur&s;ions; which may
naturally be expected to exert it&s;elf mo&s;t in
tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t quickne&s;s and
compa&s;s of imagination. If it be indulged
without re&s;erve, it will produce incoherent
medleys, fanta&s;tical rhap&s;odies, or unmeaning
<PB N="54" REF="61">
reveries. Often, however, the bye-roads of
a&s;&s;ociation, as we may term them, lead to
rich and unexpected regions, give occa&s;ion to
noble &s;allies of imagination, and proclaim an
uncommon force of genius, able to penetrate
through unfrequented ways to lofty or beau|tiful
conceptions. This is the character of
Pindar's genius, the boldne&s;s of which more
than compen&s;ates for its irregularity. The
true&s;t genius is in hazard of &s;ometimes run|ning
into &s;uperfluities, and will find occa&s;ion
to prune the luxuriance, and rectify the di&s;|order
of its fir&s;t conceptions. But this fa|culty
can never be reckoned perfect, till it
has acquired a capacity of avoiding them in
mo&s;t ca&s;es. It mu&s;t &s;upply a large &s;tock, and
at the &s;ame time manage it with economy.
While it produces all that is nece&s;&s;ary, it mu&s;t
evite all that is &s;uperfluous<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">This is well expre&s;&s;ed by Quintilian: &s;peaking of rhe|torical common-places, he ob&s;erves, that they will be hurt|ful, rather than beneficial; &startq;Ni&s;i et animi quaedam ingenita natura, et &s;tudio exercitata velocitas, recta nos ad ea quae conveniunt cau&s;ae, ferant.&endq; <HI>In&s;tit. Orat.</HI> lib. v. cap. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS to render genius complete, fertility
and regularity of imagination mu&s;t be united.
Their union forms that boundle&s;s penetration
which characteri&s;es true genius. By their
<PB N="55" REF="62">
union they will be both improved: the one
will give us an ample choice; the other will
prevent our choice from being perplexed with
needle&s;s multiplicity. An exten&s;ive imagi|nation,
impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;trong a&s;&s;ociation of
the de&s;ign, and regulated by it, will draw out
from the whole compa&s;s of nature, the &s;uit|able
ideas, without attending to any other.
In &s;tudying the works of a great genius, we
can &s;carce avoid &s;uppo&s;ing, that all po&s;&s;ible
conceptions have been explicitly expo&s;ed to
his view, and &s;ubjected to his choice. The
appo&s;ite materials are collected in as great
abundance, and pre&s;ented with as great pro|priety,
as if this had been the ca&s;e: and yet
perhaps, no other ideas have occurred to him,
but tho&s;e which he has u&s;ed. They, and
they alone, have been pre&s;ented with entire
propriety, by the regularity of a compre|hen&s;ive
imagination retaining &s;ight of the de|&s;ign
through all the &s;teps of its progre&s;s.
This effect, which re&s;ults from the union of
the&s;e two virtues, is con&s;picuous in the great
poet and in the great philo&s;opher whom we
have already mentioned, as eminently po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
both. It may be ob&s;erved by contra&s;t|ing
a &s;ingle de&s;cription of Shake&s;peare or
<PB N="56" REF="63">
Thom&s;on, with the laboured delineations of
a poetafter, who would &s;upply the want of
genuine fancy by the indu&s;try of ob&s;ervation:
in the former, all the &s;triking features of the
object, and none el&s;e, are &s;trongly marked;
in the latter, every circum&s;tance &s;eems to be
taken notice of with the minutene&s;s of a na|tural
hi&s;torian; but after all, tho&s;e features
are omitted, which are fitte&s;t for making an
impre&s;&s;ion on the fancy. Compare Euclid
with his commentators; the oppo&s;ition that
may be remarked between them, will &s;et the
character of real genius in a &s;trong light: the
train of Euclid's propo&s;itions is &s;imple, yet
complete; his laborious expo&s;itors appear to
have intended to ama&s;s all po&s;&s;ible propo|&s;itions,
however trifling or unnece&s;&s;ary. One
can &s;carce read a paragraph in Butler's <HI>Ana|logy,</HI>
or a chapter in Monte&s;quieu's <HI>Spirit of
Laws,</HI> without being &s;truck with the notion,
that the whole cour&s;e of Providence was di|rectly
in the view of the one, and the whole
hi&s;tory of mankind in the view of the other:
with &s;o great appearance of readine&s;s do they
ob&s;erve even the remote&s;t and lea&s;t obvious
circum&s;tances which can any wi&s;e affect their
argument. In &s;tudying a work of true ge|nius,
<PB N="57" REF="64">
when we attend to the multitude and
variety of the materials, we wonder how the
author could have found them all; and when
we reflect how proper and appo&s;ite every part
is, we are apt to think that it mu&s;t have oc|curred
to almo&s;t any per&s;on. Such is the
effect of copiou&s;ne&s;s and regularity of ima|gination,
united and harmoniou&s;ly exerted.</P>
<P>GENIUS implies likewi&s;e <HI>activity</HI> of ima|gination.
Whenever a fine imagination po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
healthful vigour, it will be continually
&s;tarting hints, and pouring in conceptions
upon the mind. As &s;oon as any of them ap|pears,
fancy, with the utmo&s;t alertne&s;s, places
them in every light, and enables us to pur&s;ue
them through all their con&s;equences, that we
may be able to determine, whether they will
promote the de&s;ign which we have in eye.
This activity of imagination, by which it
darts with the quickne&s;s of lightning, through
all po&s;&s;ible views of the ideas which are pre|&s;ented,
ari&s;es from the &s;ame perfection of the
a&s;&s;ociating principles, which produces the
other qualities of genius. The&s;e principles
are &s;o vigorous, that they will not allow the
mind to be unemployed for a moment, and
<PB N="58" REF="65">
at the &s;ame time con&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;t the de&s;ign
of the work, as the point to which all this
employment tends. A fal&s;e agility of ima|gination
produces mere u&s;ele&s;s mu&s;ing, or
endle&s;s reveries, and hurries a man over large
fields, without any &s;ettled aim: but true ge|nius
pur&s;ues a fixt direction, and employs its
activity in continually &s;tarting &s;uch concep|tions
as not only ari&s;e from the pre&s;ent idea,
but al&s;o terminate in the general &s;ubject: and
though a thou&s;and arrangements of the con|ceptions
which it &s;tarts, &s;hould fail of an&s;wer|ing
the intention, it is indefatigable in trying
new arrangements, till it can happily accom|pli&s;h
one that an&s;wers it. Whenever an image
or a &s;entiment occurs to the poet or the ora|tor,
imagination &s;ets it in every po&s;&s;ible light,
enables him to conceive its genuine effect,
and thus puts it in his power to judge, whe|ther
it ought to be rejected or retained. A
philo&s;opher no &s;ooner thinks of an experi|ment
or an argument, than imagination, by
repre&s;enting it in every attitude, enables him
to determine, what will be its force, and
whether it will be to his purpo&s;e. In this
manner the re&s;tle&s;s activity of imagination
<PB N="59" REF="66">
quickly con&s;tructs a &s;ort of model by which
we may form &s;ome idea of the work, before
we proceed to execute it.</P>
<P>THIS activity of imagination is of great
importance to genius. Genius may indeed,
in &s;ome degree, exi&s;t without it; ima|gination
may be comprehen&s;ive when it is
exerted, and correct, and yet not active. But
without activity, genius will never exert it|&s;elf,
except when excited and pu&s;hed for|ward
by &s;ome external cau&s;e; activity of
fancy is like an internal &s;timulus, which will
not allow genius to lie idle or dormant, but
makes it operate &s;pontaneou&s;ly and with con|&s;tancy.
Without it, invention would at be&s;t
be very &s;low. Even after materials were &s;ug|ge&s;ted,
their propriety could not be judged of,
till actual trial were made of their po&s;itions
and effects, at a great expence of time and
labour: and as &s;uch trial would be extremely
tedious and difficult, we would either take up
with the fir&s;t view or po&s;ition that occurred,
or relinqui&s;h all attempts, di&s;couraged by the
pro&s;pect of that fatigue which mu&s;t attend
the improvement of our plan. But when
fancy is expeditious in exhibiting every po&s;|&s;ible
arrangement of our conceptions, it
<PB N="60" REF="67">
quickly puts it in our power to perceive all
their con&s;equences and relations to our &s;ub|ject,
and enables us ea&s;ily to make a choice,
and &s;oon to fini&s;h our invention.</P>
<P>THUS the force of the imagination, or the
vigour of the a&s;&s;ociating principles, produces
genius, &s;o far as it regards the collection,
and even the choice of fit materials for the
di&s;covery that is propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT invention is not completed by merely
depo&s;iting a &s;ufficient quantity of proper ma|terials,
in any order, as in a magazine or
&s;tore-hou&s;e. In every ca&s;e, &s;ome degree of
regular di&s;po&s;ition is implied in the very no|tion
of invention, and comes within the pro|vince
of genius<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Collocare autem, et&s;i e&s;t commune, tamen ad inveni|endum refertur. CIC. <HI>partit. Orat.</HI></NOTE>. It is not &s;ufficient for a

the fabric; &s;o in the arts and &s;ciences, a huge
collection of conceptions which bear &s;ome
relation to one another and to the main &s;ub|ject,
will form only a confu&s;ed heap, if they
be not, by a proper di&s;po&s;ition, united into

an animal body will become mon&s;trous, though
it has all its e&s;&s;ential members, if one of
them be transferred to the place of another;
&s;o a poem will become perfectly di&s;agreeable
and fanta&s;tical, by the tran&s;po&s;ition of its
parts. A di&s;location de&s;troys the vigour of
any member of the body, and unfits it for
its proper function; and an oration will lo&s;e
its whole effect, if arguments, in&s;tead of be|ing
<PB N="62" REF="69">
di&s;tinctly urged, are blended together
without articulation. In &s;cience too, a mul|titude
of ideas, if they be not arranged in
&s;uch a manner that their connexion may be
perceived, in&s;tead of leading us to di&s;cover a
conclu&s;ion, will only involve us in perplexity,
as an army thrown into di&s;order, can make
no advantage of its numbers, but, on the
contrary, ob&s;tructs its own motions. In every
ca&s;e, di&s;po&s;ition is &s;o intimately connected
with invention, and even interwoven with
it, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate them even
in idea. If therefore imagination contribute
nothing to the di&s;po&s;ition of the materials, it
will follow, that genius mu&s;t, in a con&s;ider|able
degree, derive its origin from &s;ome
other power of the mind. But it will ap|pear
upon enquiry, that imagination contri|butes
very much to the di&s;po&s;ition of every
work.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on &s;tarts the fir&s;t hint of a
new invention, and begins to meditate a
work either in art or &s;cience, his notion of
the whole is generally but imperfect and con|fu&s;ed.
When a number of appo&s;rte concep|tions
are collected, various views of their
connexions open to him, and perplex his
<PB N="63" REF="70">
choice. But by degrees the pro&s;pect clears.
As related ideas are apt to be a&s;&s;ociated, &s;o,
by the very &s;ame con&s;titution of our nature,
tho&s;e that are mo&s;t nearly related will be
mo&s;t &s;trongly and intimately a&s;&s;ociated toge|ther.
The operations of genius in forming
its de&s;igns, are of a more perfect kind than
the operations of art or indu&s;try in executing
them. A &s;tatuary conceives all the parts of
his work at once, though when he comes to
execute it, he can form only one member at
a time, and mu&s;t during this interval leave
all the re&s;t a &s;hapele&s;s block. An architect
contrives a whole palace in an in&s;tant; but
when he comes to build it, he mu&s;t fir&s;t pro|vide
materials, and then rear the different
parts of the edifice only in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But
to collect the materials, and to order and ap|ply
them, are not to genius di&s;tinct and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
works. This faculty bears a greater
re&s;emblance to <HI>nature</HI> in its operations, than
to the le&s;s perfect energies of <HI>art.</HI> When a
vegetable draws in moi&s;ture from the earth,
nature, by the &s;ame action by which it draws
it in, and at the &s;ame time, converts it to
the nouri&s;hment of the plant: it at once cir|culates
through its ve&s;&s;els, and is a&s;&s;imilated
<PB N="64" REF="71">
to its &s;everal parts. In like manner, genius
arranges its ideas by the &s;ame operation, and
almo&s;t at the &s;ame time, that it collects them.
The &s;ame force of a&s;&s;ociation which makes
us perceive the connexion of all the ideas
with the &s;ubject, leads us &s;oon to perceive
al&s;o the various degrees of that connexion.
By means of it, the&s;e ideas, like a well-di&s;|ciplined
army, fall, of their own accord, into
rank and order, and divide them&s;elves into
different cla&s;&s;es, according to their different
relations. The mo&s;t &s;trongly related unite of
cour&s;e in the &s;ame member, and all the mem|bers
are &s;et in that po&s;ition which a&s;&s;ociation
leads us to a&s;&s;ign to them, as the mo&s;t na|tural.
If the principles of a&s;&s;ociation &s;hould
not at fir&s;t lead readily to any di&s;po&s;ition, or
&s;hould lead to one which is di&s;approved on
examination, they continue to exert them|&s;elves,
labour in &s;earching for &s;ome other
method, project new ones, throw out the
unappo&s;ite ideas which perplex the mind and
impede its operations, and thus by their con|tinued
efforts and unremitted activity, con|duct
us at length to a regular form, in which
rea&s;on can find &s;carce any idea that is mi&s;|placed.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="72">
THUS imagination is no un&s;kilful architect;
it collects and chu&s;es the materials; and
though they may at fir&s;t lie in a rude and
undige&s;ted chaos, it in a great mea&s;ure, by
its own force, by means of its a&s;&s;ociating
power, after repeated attempts and tran&s;po|&s;itions,
de&s;igns a regular and well-propor|tioned
edifice.</P>
<P>A WEAKNESS of this methodi&s;ing power
may ari&s;e either from a want of activity in
the imagination, or from our having a &s;light
a&s;&s;ociation of the de&s;ign. The former pre|vents
our turning our conceptions readily into
different forms, and thereby leads us to take
up with the fir&s;t that offers, however incor|rect.
The latter prevents our being affected
by the different connexions of the parts,
which ari&s;e from their having different re|&s;pects
and &s;ubordinations to the general de|&s;ign.
From whatever cau&s;e this weakne&s;s
proceeds, it is a great imperfection in genius.
It renders it &s;low in forming its productions,
as the confu&s;ion of the materials occa&s;ions
difficulty in applying them to u&s;e: it al&s;o
renders them le&s;s valuable when they are
formed, as they retain, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the
appearance of di&s;order, intricacy, and di&s;|agreeable
perplexity. Ari&s;totle con&s;iders the
<PB N="66" REF="73">
irregularity of di&s;po&s;ition in Euripides as a
capital imperfection, for which nothing al|mo&s;t
but his &s;ingular power of intere&s;ting
and affecting could have made atonement<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. quoted above, Sect. i. Note <HI>(b).</HI></NOTE>.
In every art, the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ubject
into a con&s;i&s;tent plan, is indeed one of the
mo&s;t important offices of invention; nor is
it a le&s;s momentous article, in di&s;coveries
which re&s;pect the &s;ciences. It is not more
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in an algebraical inve&s;ti|gation,
to a&s;certain the &s;everal quantities by
di&s;tint &s;ymbols, than to di&s;po&s;e the&s;e &s;ym|bols,
and the equations which are compo&s;ed of
them, in a regular and convenient order.</P>
<P>ENTHUSIASM has been generally con&s;i|dered
as a very common, if not an in&s;epa|rable
attendant of genius. Poets have been
looked upon as in&s;pired, both by them&s;elves
and others. No man can be an accompli&s;hed
orator, who is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch &s;en&s;ibility
of heart, as to be actuated, at plea&s;ure, by
the pa&s;&s;ions which he would excite in others.
Even the &s;peculative philo&s;opher and the cool
mathematician have often di&s;played a very
high degree of ardor in the exertion of their
genius. The explication which has been
given of the nature of genius, will not only
<PB N="67" REF="74">
enable us to account for this, but incline us
al&s;o to reckon it impo&s;&s;ible that ever an high
degree of genius &s;hould be unaccompanied
with &s;omething of that elevation and warmth
of imagination, which we term enthu&s;ia&s;m<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, who will not be &s;u&s;pected to be too great a favourer of enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;eems to a&s;&s;ert, That it alone can di&s;|po&s;e men to &s;earch for new inventions in philo&s;ophy: <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>.
Genius turns our thoughts habitually to &s;uch
&s;ubjects as are adapted to it; habitual applica|tion
to any &s;ubject, enables us to form &s;trong
and lively conceptions of every thing relating
to it; a &s;trong conception naturally invigo|rates
and elevates the imagination in contem|plating
it; and while this frame continues,
all the actions of the mind will be &s;trong and
vehement. Such is the di&s;po&s;ition with which
a man of genius turns his view to any &s;ub|ject;
as &s;oon as he begins to think how it
may be compleated, he eyes it as a rich trea|&s;ure,
with delight and conscious pride; he
triumphs in the pro&s;pect of forming
<Q>&startq;&mdash;he knows not what excelling things,&endq;</Q>
and pur&s;ues all the a&s;&s;ociations which it pre|&s;ents,
with incredible eagerne&s;s and &s;pirit.
When an ingenious track of thinking pre|&s;ents
it&s;elf, though but ca&s;ually, to true ge|nius,
<PB N="68" REF="75">
occupied it may be with &s;omething el&s;e,
imagination darts along&s;t it with great rapi|dity;
and by this rapidity its ardor is more
inflamed. The velocity of its motion &s;ets it
on fire, like a chariot wheel which is kindled
by the quickne&s;s of its revolution. As a
&s;prightly cour&s;er continually mends his pace,
&s;o genius, in proportion as it proceeds in its
&s;ubject, acquires new force and &s;pirit, which
urges it on &s;o vehemently, that it cannot be
re&s;trained from pro&s;ecuting it. Difficulties in
the execution only excite its vigour, rou&s;e its
keenne&s;s, and draw out its utmo&s;t efforts to
&s;urmount them. Its motions become &s;till
more impetuous, till the mind is enraptured
with the &s;ubject, and exalted into an exta&s;y.
In this manner the fire of genius, like a di|vine
impul&s;e, rai&s;es the mind above it&s;elf,
and by the natural influence of imagination
actuates it as if it were &s;upernaturally in&s;pired.
The ardor which thus &s;prings from the ex|ertion
of genius, has &s;ometimes ri&s;en to a
degree of fervour perfectly a&s;toni&s;hing.

as is in a great mea&s;ure &s;ufficient for
avoiding all improper ideas, for &s;electing &s;uch
as are &s;ubordinate to the de&s;ign, and for di&s;|po&s;ing
them into a con&s;i&s;tent plan, or a di&s;|tinct
method. It is the fir&s;t author of all
inventions, and has greater influence in car|rying
them to perfection, than we are ready
to &s;u&s;pect. It forms what we properly call
genius in every art, and in every &s;cience.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the influence of Judgment upon Genius.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH genius be properly a com|prehen&s;ive,
regular, and active imagi|nation,
yet it can never attain perfection, or
exert it&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully on any &s;ubject, except
it be united with a &s;ound and piercing judg|ment.
The vigour of imagination carries
it forward to invention; but under&s;tanding
mu&s;t always conduct it and regulate its mo|tions.
A hor&s;e of high mettle ranging at
liberty, will run with great &s;wiftne&s;s and
&s;pirit, but in an irregular track and without
any fixt direction: a &s;kilful rider makes him
move &s;traight in the road, with equal &s;pirit
and &s;wiftne&s;s. In like manner, a fine ima|gination
left to it&s;elf, will break out into
bold &s;allies and wild extravagance, and over|leap
the bounds of truth or probability: but
when it is put under the management of
&s;ound judgment, it leads to &s;olid and u&s;eful
invention, without having its natural &s;pright|line&s;s
in the lea&s;t impaired.</P>
<P>IT is the union of an exten&s;ive imagina|tion
with an accurate judgment, that has ac|compli&s;hed
<PB N="72" REF="79">
the great geniu&s;es of all ages.
In matters of &s;cience, the nece&s;&s;ity of judg|ment
is obvious: all the collections and ar|rangements
of ideas which imagination makes,
are immediately &s;ubjected to rea&s;on, that it
may infer truth. If we be not careful to
di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e operations of the mind which
are performed in conjunction, we &s;hall be
apt to refer philo&s;ophical genius wholly to
rea&s;on, overlooking the influence of imagina|tion.
The a&s;&s;i&s;tance of rea&s;on is as truly ne|ce&s;&s;ary
in the fine arts as in &s;cience, though
in the&s;e it has not the appearance of being &s;o
con&s;tantly applied. It is very remarkable
that all the fine arts have been cultivated, and
even brought to perfection, before the rules
of art were inve&s;tigated or formed into a &s;y&s;|tem:
there is not a &s;ingle in&s;tance of any art
that has begun to be practi&s;ed in con&s;equence
of rules being pre&s;cribed for it. The fir&s;t
performers could not have explained the
&s;everal rules which the nature of their work
made nece&s;&s;ary; but their judgment was not|with&s;tanding
&s;o exact and vigorous as to pre|vent
their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing them. Their correct|ne&s;s
is &s;o wonderfully perfect, that critics
di&s;covered the rules which they pre&s;cribe,
only by remarking tho&s;e laws by which true
<PB N="73" REF="80">
genius, though unin&s;tructed, had actually
governed it&s;elf. Ari&s;totle does not invent
new rules of compo&s;ition, but only points
out tho&s;e which Homer had formerly ob&s;erv|ed
in the Epos, Sophocles in the Drama, and
many of the Grecian orators in Eloquence.
The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be extended to
painting, mu&s;ic, and every other art. The
great geniu&s;es who invented and improved
them, have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the acute&s;t judgment,
which has faithfully attended them, and care|fully
guarded their &s;teps in tho&s;e di&s;tant and
unfrequented regions which the boldne&s;s of
their fancy led them to explore: and judg|ment
has &s;ometimes exerted it&s;elf with &s;o
great &s;ucce&s;s, that the per&s;on who attempted
the fir&s;t production in an art, has exhibited a
perfect model, in which po&s;terity could find
no fault, and the excellence of which none of
their attempts could equal. The Iliad is at
once the fir&s;t, and the be&s;t of Epic poems,
the admiration and the &s;tandard of all &s;uc|ceeding
ages. Had Homer, along with his
rich imagination, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed inferior judgment,
his poem mu&s;t, like the works of Shake&s;pear,
have had great defects, excu&s;able indeed,
but con&s;picuous and undeniable. A perfect
judgment is &s;eldom be&s;towed by Nature,
<PB N="74" REF="81">
even on her mo&s;t favoured &s;ons; but a very
con&s;iderable degree of it always belongs to
real genius. It may be remarked in the mo&s;t
incorrect and irregular arti&s;ts; even when it
has not force enough to di&s;cern every fault,
or when the violence of imagination is too
great to &s;uffer it to be exerted with &s;ufficient
&s;everity, yet &s;till it prevents perfect ab&s;ur|dity,
and re&s;trains imagination from frantic
excur&s;ions. Pindar is judicious even in his
irregularities. The boldne&s;s of his fancy, if
it had been under no control from rea&s;on,
would have produced, not wild &s;ublimity,
but madne&s;s and frenzy. Shake&s;pear's judg|ment
was not enough improved to enable him
always to avoid improper &s;ubjects, unnatural
and improbable incidents, forced and quib|bling
expre&s;&s;ions, or to perceive the regula|rity
and &s;implicity which be&s;t &s;uits the nature
of the drama; but in &s;upporting the propriety
of character, in marking the fit expre&s;&s;ions
and the natural effects of the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions,
and in many other particulars, he di&s;plays
&s;uch an uncommon accuracy of judgment, as
leads us to impute his blemi&s;hes, rather to
the bad ta&s;te of tho&s;e for whom he wrote,
than to any defect in his own under&s;tanding.
Judgment is of &s;o great importance, that,
<PB N="75" REF="82">
though we mu&s;t often acknowlege genius in
works in which judgment has not been &s;cru|pulou&s;ly
exerci&s;ed, yet this circum&s;tance never
fails to render them far le&s;s valuable than
they would have been, if they had been
fini&s;hed with correctne&s;s. The irregularity
of Rubens's de&s;igns, and his injudicious
mixture of incongruous per&s;onages in many
of his pictures, throw a &s;hade over tho&s;e ex|cellencies
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in perfection.
Nothing le&s;s than the highe&s;t degree of genius
can obtain la&s;ting and thorough approbation,
when judgment has not been accurately exer|ci&s;ed.
Shake&s;pear's unequalled genius has &s;ecur|ed
him admiration. But very great genius was
not able to pre&s;erve Dryden from the ridicule
of tho&s;e who were far his inferiors, on ac|count
of incorrectne&s;&s;es into which his unfor|tunate
circum&s;tances betrayed him; nor has
it obtained from impartial po&s;terity, &s;o great
attention and applau&s;e as much le&s;s abilities,
more judiciou&s;ly exerted, would have certainly
commanded.</P>
<P>IN a man of genius, imagination can &s;carce
take a &s;ingle &s;tep, but judgment &s;hould attend
it. The mo&s;t luxuriant fancy &s;tands mo&s;t in
need of being checked by judgment. As a
rich &s;oil produces not only the large&s;t quan|tity
<PB N="76" REF="83">
of grain, but al&s;o the greate&s;t profu&s;ion
of &s;uch weeds as tend to choak it; &s;o a fertile
imagination, along with ju&s;t and u&s;eful ideas,
produces many trifling, fal&s;e, and improper
thoughts, which, if they be not immediately
examined by rea&s;on, and &s;peedily rejected,
will over-run and ob&s;truct the truth or the
beauty which the others might have pro|duced
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Nihil e&s;t feracius ingeniis, iis prae&s;ertim, quae di&s;cipli|nis exculta $unt.

Judgment cannot collect ideas, but it revi&s;es tho&s;e which fancy has collected, and either adopts or rejects them, as it finds cau&s;e. Though a bright and comprehen&s;ive fancy be the principal ingredient in genius, yet nothing is &s;o dangerous as to affect to di&s;play it con&s;tantly, or to indulge it without any control from reflection; nothing is pro|ductive of greater faults. This leads philo&s;o|phers to con&s;truct whim&s;ical hypothe&s;es, in|&s;tead
of con&s;tructing ju&s;t theories. This leads
poets to de&s;cribe improbable events and unna|tural
characters, and to &s;earch for un&s;ea&s;on|able
wit and ill-timed &s;plendour, when judg|ment
would have directed them to imitate
nature with exactne&s;s, and to &s;tudy &s;implicity
<PB N="77" REF="84">
of expre&s;&s;ion. This leads painters caprici|ou&s;ly
to create imaginary decorations, in&s;tead
of inventing natural and con&s;i&s;tent embelli&s;h|ments.
Imagination mu&s;t &s;et all the ideas
and all the analogies of things, which it col|lects,
before the di&s;cerning eye of rea&s;on, and
&s;ubmit them ab&s;olutely to its &s;overeign deci|&s;ion.
It is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by Quintilian,
that every fiction of the human fancy is ap|proved
in the moment of its production<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Omnia no&s;tra, dum na&s;cuntur, placent. <HI>In&s;t. Orat.</HI> lib. x. cap. 3.</NOTE>.
The exertion of the mind which is requi&s;ite
in forming it, is agreeable; and the face of
novelty which infant conceptions wear, fails
not to recommend them promi&s;cuou&s;ly, till
rea&s;on has had time to &s;urvey and examine
them. Were rea&s;on never to &s;crutinize them,
all our ideas would be retained indi&s;crimi|nately,
and the productions of fancy would
be perfectly mon&s;trous. While a man is en|gaged
in compo&s;ition or inve&s;tigation, he
often &s;eems to him&s;elf to be fired with his
&s;ubject, and to teem with ideas; but on re|vi&s;ing
the work, finds that his judgment is
offended, and his time lo&s;t. An idea that
&s;parkled in the eye of fancy, is often con|demned
by judgment as fal&s;e and un&s;ub&s;tan|tial.
A more rigid exerci&s;e of this latter

<P>A FERTILE imagination is apt to overload
a work with a &s;uperfluity of ideas: an accu|rate
judgment rejects all that are unnece&s;&s;ary.
Shake&s;pear was not always able to keep the
richne&s;s of his fancy from di&s;playing it&s;elf in
ca&s;es where judgment would have directed
him to control it. That very exuberance of
imagination which commands our admiration,
is &s;ometimes indulged &s;o far as nece&s;&s;arily to
incur our cen&s;ure. We need not be at a lo&s;s
for an example. In the Mid&s;ummer Night's
Dream<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Act. 3. &s;cene 8.</NOTE>, Helena upbraiding Hermia, de|&s;cribes
<PB N="79" REF="86">
the clo&s;ene&s;s of their early friend&s;hip
in the mo&s;t natural manner, by expre&s;&s;ive
circum&s;tances &s;uited to the &s;tate of childhood;
<Q><L>Is all the coun&s;el that we two have &s;har'd,</L>
<L>The &s;i&s;ters vows, the hours that we have &s;pent,</L>
<L>When we have chid the ha&s;ty-footed time</L>
<L>For parting us; O! and is all forgot?</L>
<L>All &s;chool-days friend&s;hip, childhood innocence?</L>
<L>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</L>
<L>Created with our needles both one flower,</L>
<L>Both on one &s;ampler, &s;itting on one cu&s;hion;</L>
<L>Both warbling of one &s;ong, both in one key;</L>
<L>As if our hands, our &s;ides, voices and minds</L>
<L>Had been incorp'rate.&mdash;&mdash;</L></Q>
But here the Poet's own imagination takes
fire, and he goes on:
<Q><L>&mdash;&mdash;So we grew together</L>
<L>Like to a double cherry, &s;eeming parted,</L>
<L>But yet an union in partition,</L>
<L>Two lovely berries moulded on one &s;tem;</L>
<L>Or with two &s;eeming bodies, but one heart,</L>
<L>Two of the fir&s;t, like coats in heraldry,</L>
<L>Due but to one, and crowned with one cre&s;t.</L></Q>
And his imagination has crouded together
more images than would have been proper
though he had been de&s;cribing infant friend|&s;hip
in his own per&s;on, not to mention that
&s;ome of them are frigid and far-fetched.
<PB N="80" REF="87">
But the redundance is the more faulty, as the
de&s;cription is put into the mouth of Helena,
who was too little at ea&s;e, too much di&s;tract|ed
with vexation, to be at lei&s;ure to &s;earch for
a multitude of &s;imilitudes.</P>
<P>IMAGINATION will be often led by &s;light
and incidental a&s;&s;ociations, to &s;ugge&s;t ideas
which, when canva&s;&s;ed by judgment, are
di&s;covered to be foreign and improper.
When a man is no longer affected by the
a&s;&s;ociation which conducted him to them, he
wonders how he ever could have thought that
pertinent, which he once admired. Painters
of con&s;iderable rank have repre&s;ented friars
in the habit of their order, as pre&s;ent at &s;ome
of our Saviour's miracles. Judgment mu&s;t
perceive this to be totally ab&s;urd; but their
religion prevented their exerci&s;ing judgment
in the ca&s;e. No le&s;s an arti&s;t than Michael
Angelo introduces Charon and his boat into
the &s;olemnities of the future judgment paint|ed
according to the Chri&s;tian revelation.
The &s;lighte&s;t exertion of judgment, would
have made him &s;en&s;ible of &s;o great an incon|gruity.
An idea may often likewi&s;e, in one
point of view, be adapted to a work, which,
if &s;et in another light, would be un&s;uitable,
or le&s;s appo&s;ite. While fancy conceives the
<PB N="81" REF="88">
various attitudes in which the idea may be
placed, judgment is wakeful and ob&s;ervant,
that it may chu&s;e the propere&s;t.</P>
<P>REGULARITY of imagination, which is of
the greate&s;t importance in genius, could ne|ver
be acquired without the aid of judgment.
It is only judgment con&s;tantly exerting it&s;elf
along with fancy, and often checking it and
examining its ideas, that produces by degrees
a habit of correctne&s;s in thinking, and enures
the mind to move &s;traight forward to the end
propo&s;ed, without declining into the bye|paths
which run off on both &s;ides. Imagina|tion
is a faculty &s;o wild in its own nature,
that it mu&s;t be accu&s;tomed to the di&s;cipline of
rea&s;on before it can become tame and manage|able
enough for a correct production. Nor
will it be capable of this even after it has ac|quired
the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible regularity, except
judgment attend it and perpetually curb its
motions. The mo&s;t regular imagination will
&s;ometimes make an unnatural excur&s;ion, and
pre&s;ent improper ideas; judgment mu&s;t there|fore
be ready to review its work, and to re|ject
&s;uch ideas. Many of Bacon's conjectures
concerning &s;ubjects which he had not oppor|tunity
to examine perfectly, are fal&s;e though
they be ingenious, and would have been di&s;|avowed
<PB N="82" REF="89">
by judgment, when it had canva&s;&s;ed
them. Newton's imagination was more cor|rect
than his, and more con&s;tantly under the
control of judgment; yet rea&s;on would have
perhaps, on examination, rejected &s;ome of
the &s;uppo&s;itions which he makes in his que|ries.
The fir&s;t &s;ketch of every work of ge|nius,
is always very different from the fini&s;h|ed
piece. Not only are many things added
by the po&s;terior e&s;&s;ays of imagination, affect|ed
by new a&s;&s;ociations in repeated views of
the &s;ubject, and thus penetrating deeper into
its nature; but al&s;o many things are re|trenched
or altered by judgment on a revi&s;al,
which it had not force enough to prevent
fancy from exhibiting in the cour&s;e of the
invention. A&s;&s;ociation could not recal the
idea of the de&s;ign, in order to bring back
fancy when it has wandered from it, if judg|ment
did not inform us that it had wandered,
by perceiving the tendency of the ideas which
it has &s;ugge&s;ted. The fine&s;t imagination,
totally de&s;titute of a&s;&s;i&s;&s;tance from judgment,
would in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;emble a blind man,
who may be very dexterous in groping the
right road, but cannot know certainly, whe|ther
he continues in it, and has no means of
recovering it. if he once &s;tray.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="90">
No degree of correctne&s;s can hinder imagi|nation
from introducing different ideas that
are all conducive to the propo&s;ed de&s;ign. But
&s;ome of them may promote it more than
others. In this ca&s;e, judgment alone can de|termine
which is fitte&s;t, and enable us to make
a choice. If it did not exert it&s;elf, fancy
mu&s;t continue for ever at a &s;tand, di&s;tracted
with the variety, and undetermined where to
fix. Sometimes again it happens, that tho'
each of the ideas is &s;ub&s;ervient to the end in
view, yet they are &s;o incongruous that they
cannot be all adopted with propriety. Shake|&s;pear<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure.</NOTE> de&s;cribes the terrors of death, by a
variety of very &s;triking and poetical images;
<Q><L>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where,</L>
<L>To live in cold ob&s;truction, and to rot,</L>
<L>This &s;en&s;ible warm motion to become</L>
<L><HI>A kneaded clod;</HI> and the dilated &s;pirit</L>
<L>To bath in fiery floods, or to re&s;ide</L>
<L>In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice,</L>
<L>To be impri&s;on'd in the viewle&s;s winds,</L>
<L>And blown with re&s;tle&s;s violence round about</L>
<L>The pendant world.&mdash;</L></Q>
All the ideas here introduced are conducive
to the poet's de&s;ign, and might have been
<PB N="84" REF="91">
&s;ugge&s;ted by the correcte&s;t fancy. It is only
judgment that can di&s;approve the uniting of
them in the &s;ame de&s;cription, as being here|rogencous,
derived partly from Chri&s;tian
manners, and partly from pagan notions.
This faculty would have directed the poet to
retain only the former, as being mo&s;t con|gruous
to Claudio the &s;peaker, or, if he
thought not the&s;e &s;ufficient, to &s;et fancy again
to work, to fini&s;h the de&s;cription with con|&s;i&s;tent
images.</P>
<P>EVERY work of genius is a whole, made
up by the regular combination of different
parts, &s;o organized as to become altogether
&s;ub&s;ervient to a common end. The different
degrees of relation which the parts bear to
one another and to the end, affecting imagi|nation
in proportion to their clo&s;ene&s;s, lead it
to a&s;&s;ign to each its proper place, and thus
lay the foundation of a natural di&s;po&s;ition.
But however perfectly the a&s;&s;ociating princi|ples
perform this part of their office, a per&s;on
will &s;carce reckon him&s;elf certain of the pro|priety
of that di&s;po&s;ition, till it has been au|thori&s;ed
by judgment. Fancy forms the plan
in a &s;ort of mechanical or in&s;tinctive manner:
judgment, on reviewing it, perceives its rec|titude
or its errors, as it were &s;cientifically;
<PB N="85" REF="92">
its deci&s;ions are founded on reflection, and
produce a conviction of their ju&s;tne&s;s. The
&s;ame qualities which form natural relations
among the parts of a work, affecting the
imagination, produce corre&s;pondent philo&s;o|phical
relations among the&s;e parts, which
judgment can contemplate, in re&s;pect of which
it can compare the &s;everal parts, and di&s;cover
their influence on one another, and on the
whole, and can by this means perceive, with|out
danger of error, the &s;ituations that ought
to be a&s;&s;igned them. For in&s;tance, in a fable
fit for tragedy, there are &s;ome incidents
which are properly cau&s;es, and others which
are their effects or con&s;equences: cau&s;ation
operating on the fancy as an a&s;&s;ociating qua|lity,
will lead imagination, in the mo&s;t rapid
career of invention, even though it &s;hould
outrun judgment, to place the&s;e incidents for
the mo&s;t part in their natural &s;ituation, accord|ing
to the relation which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between
them: and cau&s;ation is at the &s;ame time a
philo&s;ophical relation, by contemplating which
judgment can determine, what incidents are
&s;it to form the beginning, what to form the
middle, and what the end. Thus even when
fancy is mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in contriving a na|tural
di&s;po&s;ition, it is from the review of rea|&s;on
<PB N="86" REF="93">
we derive a&s;&s;urance of its being natural
and ju&s;t. But it often happens that fancy
throws its materials into di&s;order. In this
ca&s;e it is only judgment that can perceive the
error. An accidental or tri&s;ling a&s;&s;ociation
may mi&s;lead fancy; but judgment is not &s;ub|ject
to the impul&s;e, it &s;urveys deliberately
the connexions of the parts, it remarks their
mutual influence, it convinces us of the im|propriety
of their po&s;ition, and puts fancy
upon making efforts to imagine others, which
it attends to as they ri&s;e, and either rejects,
or apporves them.</P>
<P>To form a proper plain in any exten&s;ive
work of genius, is a matter of &s;uch difficulty
as to require the union of imagination and
rea&s;on in their greate&s;t &s;trength. Imagination
mu&s;t exhibit all the various po&s;itions of the
parts, and conceive the effect of every part in
each of the&s;e po&s;itions. Judgment mu&s;t at
the &s;ame time &s;urvey them with a piercing
eye, compare readily the effect of each part
in one po&s;ition, with its effect in another,
and from the re&s;ult of its compari&s;ons, quickly
pronounce, which is the be&s;t arrangement.
Fancy could not have formed the regular
plan of an epic poem, though Homer had had
the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;tant perception of
<PB N="87" REF="94">
the end at which it aimed, if judgment had
not, from the con&s;ideration of this end, and
the repeated compari&s;on of it with the means
which imagination propo&s;ed for accompli&s;hing
it, di&s;covered, in what &s;ituation every inci|dent
would produce the very greate&s;t effect.
One needs only read over the curious &s;eries
of experiments by which Newton has inve&s;ti|gated
the laws of light and colours, to be con|vinced
that it required the nice&s;t judgment,
as well as the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive imagina|tion,
to conduct them in &s;uch a manner that
every &s;ucceeding one &s;hould confirm and ex|tend
the conclu&s;ions to which the preceding
ones had given ri&s;e.</P>
<P>IT de&s;erves al&s;o to be remarked, that every
difference in the nature of an invention, re|quires
a corre&s;pondent variety in the di&s;po&s;i|tion.
A fine imagination will in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
by its own power, diver&s;ify the arrange|ment
agreeably to the nature of the inven|tion;
but it may reap great advantage from
the aid of judgment. When this faculty has
con&s;idered all the circum&s;tances of the &s;ub|ject,
it can determine with certainty, which
of the plans &s;ugge&s;ted by fancy, will mo&s;t
promote the perfection of the work. De|mo&s;thenes
and Ae&s;ehines have adopted di&s;po|&s;itions
<PB N="88" REF="95">
perfectly oppo&s;ite, in their orations at
the trial of Cte&s;iphon. The oppo&s;ite ends at
which they aimed, &s;ugge&s;ted this contrariety
of the means; but it was judgment perceiv|ing
the one di&s;po&s;ition fitte&s;t for impre&s;&s;ing
the judges with a &s;en&s;e of Cte&s;iphon's guilt,
and the other fitte&s;t for convincing them of
his innocence, that determined the rival ora|tors
to chu&s;e the oppo&s;ite roads which they
have taken.</P>
<P>THUS, while imagination is active in con|ceiving
all the various combinations and ar|rangements
of the ideas which it has collect|ed,
judgment mu&s;t be as indefatigable in &s;ur|veying
them, and determining concerning
their real force and con&s;equences. It mu&s;t
remark in an in&s;tant tho&s;e po&s;itions of them
which are unfit for an&s;wering the purpo&s;e,
and be able, without lo&s;ing much time in
&s;crutinizing them, to pitch upon tho&s;e that
are &s;it. Fancy throws out both the worthle&s;s
earth and the rich ore; judgment, like a &s;kil|ful
refiner, di&s;tingui&s;hes the one from the
other, and purifies the gold contained in the
latter, from the dro&s;s with which it is inter|mingled.
The re&s;tle&s;s efforts of the mo&s;t
healthful imagination would be both u&s;ele&s;s
and endle&s;s, if they were not &s;ubjected to the
<PB N="89" REF="96">
cognizance of rea&s;on. To imagine all the
po&s;&s;ible arrangements of a &s;et of ideas, were
an unmeaning play of thought, if they merely
pa&s;&s;ed through the mind, like the images that
are &s;aid to &s;ucceed one another in the brown
&s;tudy, without rea&s;on being able to arre&s;t
&s;uch of them as it approves. Were rea&s;on
only &s;low in her determinations, in compari|&s;on
with the quickne&s;s with which fancy
conceives, like Una's dwarf, <HI>lagging behind
her far away,</HI> even this would greatly impede
the work of genius, retard its progre&s;s, or
&s;top it altogether by con&s;tantly curbing the
impetuo&s;ity of fancy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Atque plero&s;que videas haerentes circa &s;ingula, et dum inveniunt, et dum inventa ponderant. Quod etiam &s;i idcirco fieret, ut &s;emper optimis uterentur, abominanda tamen haec infelicitas erat, quae et cur&s;um dicendi refrenat, et calorem cogitationis extinguit mora et diffidentia. QUINT. <HI>In&s;t. Orat.</HI> lib. viii. proem.</NOTE>. Or if its &s;pirit were
too hardy to be wholly broken, it would out|run
its companion; it would di&s;po&s;e a man to
take up with the fir&s;t conception that occur|red,
rather than weary him&s;elf in attempts to
procure better, when judgment were &s;o dull
as not to di&s;tingui&s;h readily which de&s;erves
the preference.</P>
<P>IN this manner judgment a&s;&s;i&s;ts, moderates,
and guides the exertions of imagination thro'
the whole cour&s;e of the invention. But after
<PB N="90" REF="97">
imagination has de&s;i&s;ted from its work, judg|ment
reviews, corrects, and fini&s;hes it. In
&s;cience, the work cannot receive even its rude
form till rea&s;on has compared the &s;everal
ideas and ob&s;ervations which fancy had &s;ug|ge&s;ted,
and perceived their connexions, and
inferred their con&s;equences. And in the arts,
where fancy is able to accompli&s;h a &s;ketch of
the whole, the review of rea&s;on is ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary, to poli&s;h and improve the work.
Whenever fancy happens to &s;tray, judgment
alone can perceive that it has &s;trayed; and
though it has attended fancy during the whole
&s;eries of its inve&s;tigations, ob&s;erving its errors
and drawing it off from them, it is al&s;o re|qui&s;ite
that it renew its examination when
the work is fini&s;hed. It can then take a
more deliberate &s;urvey of the whole, and will
be able to reject or alter many things which
it formerly allowed to remain untouched,
either becau&s;e it did not perceive them on a
tran&s;ient view, or becau&s;e it was unwilling to
chill the ardor of fancy by &s;o long a delay as
would have been nece&s;&s;ary for amending
them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>. The end leads a per&s;on to the di&s;|covery
<PB N="91" REF="98">
of the means which are adapted to it;
and the mutual relations of the&s;e means de|termine
the form and the &s;ituation into which
each of them &s;hould be thrown as it occurs;
judgment will pronounce concerning the&s;e
with con&s;iderable ju&s;tne&s;s, during the forma|tion
of the work: but after the work is fini&s;h|ed,
when it has the whole in its view at once,
it has an opportunity of pronouncing many
deci&s;ions on points concerning which it had
not formerly the means of determining. A
view of the whole directs it to retrench one
part as &s;uperfluous in re&s;pect of the general
de&s;ign, to enlarge another as defective, to
&s;often &s;ome features, to heighten others, to
brighten this part, and to ca&s;t that into a
&s;hade.</P>
<P>IN the exertion of genius, judgment not
only regulates imagination, in the ways which
have been hitherto pointed out, but often
likewi&s;e &s;upplies it with new materials.
Judgment cannot by its own power &s;ugge&s;t a
train of ideas, but its determinations often put
fancy into a new track, and enable it to ex|tend
its views. Imagination can introduce
ideas only by means of their connexion with
&s;ome pre&s;ent perception from which it &s;ets out
in &s;earch of them: and this perception is in
<PB N="92" REF="99">
many ca&s;es no other than a deci&s;ion of judg|ment.
Every review that judgment takes of
the productions of genius, di&s;covers &s;ome re|lation
of the parts. This relation is a new
perception which may tran&s;port fancy to
others that are connected with it, and thus
conduct it into regions which it did not for|merly
think of exploring, and from which it
may bring home many conceptions fit for
perfecting its work. A few experiments will
enable a philo&s;opher to exerci&s;e his judgment
&s;o far as to gue&s;s at the conclu&s;ions to which
they lead, or to determine the different ways
in which the phenomena that they exhi|bit,
may be accounted for. And this exer|tion
of rea&s;on will lead him to imagine the
farther experiments that are nece&s;&s;ary for
bringing the que&s;tion to a deci&s;ion, experi|ments
of which he never would have thought
if this judgment had not intervened. It is
only a judgment that can be the occa&s;ion of
&s;ugge&s;ting what is called an <HI>experimentum
crucis,</HI> in philo&s;ophical enquiries. Had not
judgment been properly exerci&s;ed, M. Azout
could never have contrived an experiment of
this kind, for determining the cau&s;e of the
a&s;cent of fluids in exhau&s;ted tubes, nor Sir
I&s;aac Newton for evincing indi&s;putably that
<PB N="93" REF="100">
the inequality of refraction in the pri&s;matic
image, ari&s;es from an original difference in
the rays of which the light of the &s;un is com|po&s;ed.
When a poet has, by the exerci&s;e of
judgment, determined the general nature and
qualities of the incidents which will be pro|per
for promoting the end of his poem, this
determination will a&s;&s;i&s;t him in finding out
&s;uch incidents. Homer having di&s;covered by
judgment, that the de&s;ign of an epic poem
would be be&s;t accompli&s;hed by a &s;eries of inci|dents
ri&s;ing naturally from one another, and
by means of their mutual dependence con&s;ti|tuting
one action, doubtle&s;s found many inci|dents
&s;ugge&s;ted to him by this view of the
economy of the whole, which might have
otherwi&s;e e&s;caped his notice. Spencer having
neglected to form &s;uch a previous judgment
of the nature of his work, needed all the
force of his amazing fancy, along with the
numerous fictions of romance, to furni&s;h him
with &s;uch a variety of unconnected adventures
as might continually engage the &s;oul and fill
it with &s;urpri&s;e by their extravagance and
boldne&s;s. All the a&s;&s;i&s;tances in invention,
which orators have contrived, by means of
topics and common places, are founded on
<PB N="94" REF="101">
this principle; That judgment, by &s;urveying
the work directs imagination to many quar|ters
where it may find conceptions adapted to
its purpo&s;e: and Quintilian ju&s;tly ob&s;erves,
that the&s;e artificial helps are no farther u&s;eful
than as they enable imagination to take the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Dependence of Genius on other intel|lectual

<P>IT was formerly ob&s;erved, that all our in|tellectual
powers may be reduced to four
cla&s;&s;es, &s;en&s;e, memory, imagination, and judg|ment.
We have found that Genius is the im|mediate
offspring of the imagination, and
that it is attended by judgment in all its exer|tions.
Its relation to &s;en&s;e and memory, is
more di&s;tant, and its dependence on them
more indirect. What is the preci&s;e nature of
this relation and dependence, will appear
from the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;ociating principles of the mind
would never exert them&s;elves if they were not
excited into action by the impul&s;e of &s;ome
object already perceived. It is only when
thus excited, that imagination runs out in
&s;earch of tho&s;e ideas which are related to that
object. On this account, in analy&s;ing the
<PB N="96" REF="103">
operations of genius, we mu&s;t at la&s;t have re|cour&s;e
to &s;ome perception giving ri&s;e to them,
which was not it&s;elf &s;ugge&s;ted by imagination,
but exhibited either by &s;en&s;e or by memory<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Quicquid porro animo cernimus, id omne oritur a &s;en|&s;ibus. Cic. <HI>de &s;in.</HI> lib. i. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>.
The&s;e faculties give therefore in a manner
the fir&s;t hint of every invention; a hint per|haps
incon&s;iderable in it&s;elf, but which may
in &s;ome &s;en&s;e be con&s;idered as the &s;ource of
the whole di&s;covery that genius makes by
means of it. The large&s;t river takes its ri&s;e
from &s;ome &s;mall fountain; i&s;&s;uing from this,
it rolls its &s;treams over a long extent of coun|try,
and is enlarged during its cour&s;e by the
influx of many rivulets derived from &s;prings
no more con&s;iderable than its own, till at la&s;t
it becomes an impa&s;&s;able torrent, liker to the
ocean than to the pitiful rill which purled
near its &s;ource. In like manner, even tho&s;e
works of genius which appear mo&s;t &s;tupen|dous
when they are compleated, &s;pring at fir&s;t
from &s;ome &s;ingle perception of &s;en&s;e or me|mory,
obvious, it may be, and trifling, and
become &s;tupendous only by the gradual acce&s;|&s;ion
of ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by perceptions equally
trivial and common. We admire with rea|&s;on,
<PB N="97" REF="104">
the genius di&s;played by Newton in the
di&s;covery of the laws of gravitation which the
cele&s;tial bodies ob&s;erve in their revolutions.
It was perhaps his perceiving by &s;en&s;e a &s;tone
or an apple fall to the ground, without any
vi&s;ible force impelling it, or the remembrance
of this common appearance, that excited his
genius, and directed it to that train of thought
which conducted him at la&s;t to the inve&s;tiga|tion
of the&s;e laws. It is affirmed by an anci|ent
author<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MACROB. lib. ii.</NOTE>, that the accidental hearing of
the noi&s;e of a &s;mith's hammers of different
weights, gave Pythagoras the fir&s;t hint of the
cau&s;e of the variety of mu&s;ical &s;ounds, and
led him by degrees into a complete theory of
mu&s;ic<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">An $legant modern writer relates this remarkable &s;tory, to the following purpo&s;e. &startq;Who would have thought that the clangorous noi&s;e of a &s;mith's hammers &s;hould have given the fir&s;t ri&s;e to mu&s;ic? Yet Macrobius, in his &s;econd book, relates that Pythagoras, in pa&s;&s;ing by a &s;mith's &s;hop, found that the &s;ounds proceeding from the hammers were either more grave, or acute, according to the different weights of the hammers. The philo&s;opher, to improve this hint, &s;u&s;|pends different weights by &s;trings of the &s;ame bigne&s;s, and found in like manner that the &s;ounds an&s;wered to the weights. This being di&s;covered, he finds out tho&s;e numbers which pro|duced &s;ounds that were con&s;o$a$s: as that two &s;trings of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance and ten&s;ion, the one being double the length of the other, gave that interval which is called <HI>diapa&s;on</HI> or an eighth; the &s;ame was al&s;o effected from two &s;trings of the &s;ame length and &s;ize, the one having four times the ten&s;ion of the other.

di&s;po&s;e him to con&s;ider in what manner it

which a poet is engaged, and which he has
already conceived, that leads him, by re&s;em|blance,
to find out an image proper for illu&s;|trating
it. In every ca&s;e, &s;en&s;e or memory
&s;ets imagination at fir&s;t in that road, by pur|&s;uing
which it arrives at important inven|tions.</P>
<P>THE brighte&s;t imagination can &s;ugge&s;t no
idea which is not originally derived from
&s;en&s;e and memory. In many ca&s;es, even in
&s;uch as very much di&s;play its power, it does
no more but call in &s;ea&s;onably the very con|ceptions
which &s;en&s;e has conveyed, and which
memory retains. A philo&s;opher is often led
to an important conclu&s;ion, by recollecting in
its proper place a phenomenon which he re|members
to have very commonly ob&s;erved.
A great part of poetry con&s;i&s;ts in de&s;criptions
properly introduced, of tho&s;e external objects
which the poet has actually ob&s;erved, or in
the expre&s;&s;ion on &s;uitable occa&s;ions, of the
<PB N="99" REF="106">
&s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions which he has him&s;elf
been con&s;cious of, or which he has di&s;covered
in other men on &s;imilar occa&s;ions. It is no
reproach to genius to receive its materials
thus wholly prepared, from &s;en&s;e and me|mory.
Its force appears &s;ufficiently in its
laying hold on them at the proper time, and
arranging them in regular order. Homer's
compari&s;ons have ever been and will always
be admired as indications of &s;urpri&s;ing genius:
the immen&s;e variety of them, the facility with
which they appear to occur, the perfect cor|re&s;pondence
of the images with the &s;ubject
for the illu&s;tration of which they are pro|duced,
and the maje&s;tic &s;implicity with which
they are expre&s;&s;ed, leave no room to doubt of
the poet's genius. But the images them&s;elves
are generally drawn from &s;uch objects as he
well remembered to have &s;een. The frag|ments
of true hi&s;tory which the fame poet
has related, are to be referred wholly to me|mory;
imagination was employed only in the
introduction and application of them. In this
manner, as a ma&s;ter-builder has his materials
prepared by inferiour workmen, or as a hi&s;|tory
painter is provided with his colours by
the labour of others, &s;o the faculty of inven|tion
often receives the entire ideas which it
<PB N="100" REF="107">
exhibits, from the inferiour faculties, and
employs it&s;elf only in applying and arrange|ing
them. Hence it proceeds that poets of
original genius always expre&s;s the manners
of their own age, and the natural appear|ances
which have occurred to them&s;elves. It
was Homer's exten&s;ive ob&s;ervation of men
and things that &s;upplied him with &s;o immen&s;e
a field of thought. The cu&s;toms of the age
directed Spen&s;er, at lea&s;t in part, to form his
plan on allegorical adventures of chivalry<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>WARTON's</HI> Ob&s;ervations on Spen&s;er, p. 218.</NOTE>,
and induced Ta&s;&s;o to found his poem on a
holy war. O&s;&s;ian's imagery is &s;o different
from what would be &s;ugge&s;ted by the pre&s;ent
&s;tate of things, that a modern writer could
&s;carce bring him&s;elf to run into it, much le&s;s
to pre&s;erve it uniformly, by the utmo&s;t efforts
of &s;tudy, or even by de&s;igned imitation; but
it is perfectly agreeable to all that we can con|ceive
of the face of nature and the &s;tate of
&s;ociety in the times when that author is &s;up|po&s;ed
to have lived.</P>
<P>BUT even when imagination does not &s;ug|ge&s;t
conceptions which have been received
entire from &s;en&s;e and memory, but creates
&s;uch as are properly its own, it mu&s;t &s;till not|with&s;tanding
derive from the&s;e &s;ources, the
<PB N="101" REF="108">
ingredients of which it compounds them.
The parts and members of its ideas have
been conveyed &s;eparately by the &s;en&s;es, and
depo&s;ited in the memory, though fancy has
united them in a manner in which they were
never ob&s;erved to be combined. The power
of fancy is &s;ubjected to the &s;ame limitation as
our power over the natural world. Give it a
&s;tock of &s;imple ideas, and it will produce an
endle&s;s variety of complex notions: but as
we can create no new &s;ub&s;tance, &s;o neither
can we, except perhaps in a few very pecu|liar
in&s;tances, imagine the idea of a &s;imple
quality which we have never had acce&s;s to
ob&s;erve. When a philo&s;opher attempts a new
experiment, he only places bodies already
known, in a &s;ituation in which the&s;e bodies
never were ob&s;erved, but of which he has an
idea by having &s;een other bodies placed in
that or a like relation; and if he be able,
previous to actual trial, to gue&s;s what appear|ances
the experiment will di&s;clo&s;e, the ability
ari&s;es only from his remembering the re&s;ult of
another experiment in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;imilar
to the pre&s;ent. The bolde&s;t fictions of the
poets, which lea&s;t re&s;emble any thing in na|ture,
are yet compo&s;ed of parts which really
exi&s;t in nature. When Homer formed the
<PB N="102" REF="109">
idea of <HI>Chimera,</HI> he only joined into one ani|mal,
parts which belonged to different ani|mals;
the head of a lion, the body of a goat,
and the tail of a &s;erpent<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></Q>
<BIBL><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></BIBL></NOTE>. Phidias is &s;aid
to have formed his celebrated &s;tatue of Jupiter,
merely by the force of his imagination, from
Homer's de&s;cription of that deity<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></P>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L></NOTE>. Yet
&s;till he only varied a little the ordinary fea|tures
of a man. Even tho&s;e painters who
have been mo&s;t celebrated for invention, have
generally &s;atisfied them&s;elves with inventing
the action, and have derived the particular
figures and their attitudes from ob&s;ervation
of &s;everal individuals, and &s;ometimes even
from the imitation of one individual.</P>
<P>INDEED though it were po&s;&s;ible for fancy
to create ideas wholly unlike to tho&s;e things
which men have acce&s;s to ob&s;erve, the attempt
would prove entirely u&s;ele&s;s. The arti&s;t
might amu&s;e him&s;elf with the forms of his
own creation, but they would produce no
effect either on the ta&s;te or on the pa&s;&s;ions of
<PB N="103" REF="110">
others. Men can be touched only by ideas
which they are able readily to conceive; and
they can conceive only tho&s;e ideas, the mem|bers
of which &s;en&s;e has already depo&s;ited in
the memory. On this account we find it dif|ficult
to enter into manners very different
from our own. The refinement to which
we are accu&s;tomed in modern times, renders
the &s;implicity of manners which Homer attri|butes
to his heroes, an object of &s;urpri&s;e.
That &s;implicity of manners prevailed in his
time, and prevented his contemporaries from
affixing an idea of meanne&s;s to many actions
and appearances in common life, from which
he derives compari&s;ons to illu&s;trate the &s;u|blime&s;t
objects. But modern luxury has rai&s;ed
the polite into a &s;phere &s;o di&s;tinct from what
is termed low life, that we mu&s;t put a &s;ort of
force upon our minds, in order to &s;eparate
ideas of meanne&s;s from &s;uch things as can
now occur only in a &s;hepherd's cottage or a
country village. Critics more delicate than
judicious, are &s;o entirely under the in&s;luence
of this prejudice, that they &s;tigmati&s;e the pa&s;|&s;ages
of ancient authors which refer to cu&s;|toms
very different from tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent
age.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="111">
MEMORY a&s;&s;i&s;ts genius in another re&s;pect.
To recollect in&s;tead of inventing, &s;hows a de|fect
of genius; but it were faulty to be &s;o
intent upon invention, as &s;tudiou&s;ly to avoid
recollection on all occa&s;ions. If we lo&s;e &s;ight
altogether of the beaten road of memory, we
&s;hall be in danger of mi&s;&s;ing our way in the
winding paths of imagination. So bold an
adventurer will come at la&s;t to regions inha|bited
only by mon&s;ters. It is not &s;ufficient
for rendering a production natural, that its
&s;eparate parts be copied from real things;
the order and connexions of the real things
mu&s;t likewi&s;e be in &s;ome mea&s;ure imitated.
If the parts of a work be put in a &s;ituation
totally unlike to that which corre&s;ponding
objects in nature po&s;&s;e&s;s, it will give the &s;ame
kind of di&s;gu&s;t as if the parts them&s;elves had
been perfectly fanta&s;tical. If a philo&s;opher
&s;hould deduce any phenomenon from a known
cau&s;e, by a proce&s;s oppo&s;ite to what we have
ob&s;erved in &s;imilar ca&s;es, we would &s;u&s;pect
for this very rea&s;on, that his explication were
rather a whim&s;ical hypothe&s;is, than a legiti|mate
inv&s;tigation, and we would readily
pronounce that his imagination might have
been corrected by his memory, and led into a
<PB N="105" REF="112">
much ju&s;ter train of thinking. If a number
of events natural in them&s;elves, were com|bined
in the action of a poem &s;o as to &s;ucceed
one another in an order and by relations per|fectly
di&s;&s;imilar to every &s;eries which hi&s;tory
or our own ob&s;ervation had exhibited, we
could not but be di&s;gu&s;ted with this deviation
from what memory informs us is the reality
of things. The cour&s;e of nature is &s;o &s;teddy
and regular, that a certain analogy runs thro'
all the parts of it. Whenever any &s;eries of
events is exhibited to the mind, memory re|collect
&s;ome other part of the cour&s;e of na|ture;
and if the ordinary analogy be want|ing,
that &s;eries is pronounced unnatural and
improbable. On this account, even in ca&s;es
where the greate&s;t latitude is allowed to in|vention,
care mu&s;t be taken that the offspring
of genius bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to the por|trait
of nature, which memory retains: and
this re&s;emblance cannot be produced unle&s;s
memory is con&s;ulted while genius exerts
it&s;elf, and this latter faculty in this manner
vouch&s;afes to take its model from the former.
This is the foundation of Horace's rule:

<PB N="106" REF="113">
In a word, Genius is often led to its inven|tions
by a train of ideas &s;ugge&s;ted to it by a
&s;imilar train which memory retains, and it
is only the remembrance of the latter that
enables judgment to determine concerning the
ju&s;tne&s;s of the former.</P>

fit them for being a&s;&s;ociated; and next, whe|ther
there be any principles in the human

<P>AMONG tho&s;e qualities or relations of

<P>PERCEPTIONS may re&s;emble one another
in different manners, and in very different
degrees; but whenever they at all re&s;emble,
one of them being pre&s;ent to the mind, will
naturally tran&s;port it to the conception of the

Any one quality or circum&s;tance common to
two perceptions, forms a re&s;emblance between
them, &s;ufficient to connect them in the ima|gination:
it is generally &s;uch an imperfect
re&s;emblance as this, that &s;ugge&s;ts &s;imilitudes
and images<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Non enim res tota toti rei nece&s;&s;e e&s;t, &s;imilis &s;it, &s;ed ad ip&s;um, ad quod conferetur, &s;imilitudinem habeat oportet.<HI>Ad H$ren.</HI> lib. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CONTRARIETY is a word commonly u&s;ed
with con&s;iderable latitude. There are &s;ome
perceptions which do not readily introduce
their contraries: but in very many in&s;tances
a perception does &s;ugge&s;t another which is in
&s;ome &s;en&s;e contrary to it; and therefore con|trariety
may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as a princi|ple
of a&s;&s;ociation. &startq;The &s;un-beams, &s;ays
Verulam<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Inqui&s;itio de Calore et Frigore.</NOTE>, do turn wine into vinegar;
but <HI>Qu.</HI> Whether they would not &s;weeten
verjuice?&endq; In this ca&s;e, one effect of the
&s;un-beams leads him to conceive a contrary
effect in a contrary &s;ubject. When light is
perceived, it does not ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;ts the idea
of darkne&s;s; but the perception of darkne&s;s
very quickly &s;ugge&s;ts the idea of light. In
<PB N="112" REF="119">
health we are not ready to think of &s;ickne&s;s;
but &s;ickne&s;s forcibly introduceth the idea of
health. When we feel cold, we very natu|rally
think of heat, and of the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e
who enjoy it. When we are warm and com|fortably
lodged in a &s;tormy night, it is not
uncommon to reflect with pity on the oppo|&s;ite
condition of tho&s;e who are abroad: here
however the a&s;&s;ociation is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by, and is
perhaps chiefly owing to the perception of the
&s;torm, &s;ugge&s;ting ideas of its effects. Re|markable
dangers or di&s;tre&s;&s;es in which a per|&s;on
has &s;ome time been involved, dwell on
his imagination, and are brought into his
view by every thing of an oppo&s;ite nature, in
his after &s;ituation. A per&s;on rai&s;ed &s;uddenly
to pro&s;perity, riches, or power, will &s;ome|times
find his former poverty, meanne&s;s, or
ob&s;curity forcing it&s;elf into his thoughts; and
they will much oftner be &s;ugge&s;ted to &s;pecta|tors,
by the view of his pre&s;ent elevation. A
per&s;on fallen into adver&s;ity of any kind, will
find him&s;elf &s;till more &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed to
recollect the pro&s;perity which preceded it;
the imagination of a &s;pectator al&s;o is naturally
led to the thought of this. Old men oppre&s;&s;ed
with infirmities, and become incapable of
enjoyment, naturally dwell on the &s;trength,
<PB N="113" REF="120">
the activity, and the plea&s;ures of their youth.
A monarch groaning under the cares of go|vernment,
and kept awake by his di&s;quietude,
will readily think on the ea&s;e of the pea&s;ant,
and reflect,
<Q>How many thou&s;ands of my poore&s;t &s;ubjects
Are at this hour a&s;leep!&mdash;<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Second Part of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. act 3. &s;cene 1.</NOTE></Q>
The reflection is &s;ugge&s;ted by a twofold con|trariety,
that between the meanne&s;s of the
&s;ubject and the elevation of the king, and
that between the ea&s;e of the former and the
re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the latter. A per&s;on's di&s;po&s;i|tion
or conduct at one time, will put us in
mind of a contrary di&s;po&s;ition which he has
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or of a contrary conduct which he
has pur&s;ued, at another time. Friend&s;hip be|tween
per&s;ons who have been reconciled, na|turally
puts us in mind of their former en|mity.
Enmity ari&s;ing between old friends,
&s;ugge&s;ts the idea of their intimacy in times
pa&s;t. Shake&s;pear introduces King Henry as
&s;aying, when he heard of Northumberland's
rebellion,
<Q><L>'Tis not ten years &s;ince Richard and Northum|berland</L>
<L>Did fea&s;t together; and in two years after</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="121">
Were they at wars: it is but eight years &s;ince</L>
<L>This Piercy was the man neare&s;t my &s;oul,</L>
<L>Who like a brother to$l'd in my affairs,</L>
<L>And laid his love and life under my foot;</L>

<L>Gave him defiance.&mdash;<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Second part of Henry IV. act 3. &s;cene 2.</NOTE></L></Q>
In like manner any &s;pecies of behaviour in one
per&s;on, will &s;ometimes &s;ugge&s;t contrary or
very different conduct in another. Thus
King Henry, on hearing the exploits of
young Piercy, naturally &s;ays,
<Q><L>Yea there thou mak'&s;t me &s;ad, and mak'&s;t me &s;in</L>
<L>In envy that my Lord Northumberland</L>
<L>Should be the father of &s;o ble&s;t a &s;on,</L>

The &s;ame poet furni&s;hes us with a compli|cated
example of the influence of contrariety
in &s;ugge&s;ting ideas, in a pa&s;&s;age of Clifford's
&s;peech to Henry VI. York's ambitious care
of his &s;on, &s;ugge&s;ts the King's faulty indif|ference
about his &s;on; and this again &s;ug|ge&s;ts
the care of brute creatures about their

the &s;ame time another contra&s;t between them

Here two birds u&s;ing their wings for repelling
danger, &s;ugge&s;ts to the poet the oppo&s;ite pur|po&s;e
of flying from danger, for which they
commonly employ them. Thus many per|ceptions
naturally introduce &s;uch others as
are in &s;ome &s;en&s;e contrary to them. Indeed
&s;o much does contraricty influence the train
of our ideas, that a great part of common
conver&s;ation, e&s;pecially that of old men, con|&s;i&s;ts
in remarking the changes, vici&s;&s;itudes,
<PB N="116" REF="123">
and rever&s;es which they have had occa&s;ion to
ob&s;erve in per&s;ons and in things.</P>
<P>VICINITY is likewi&s;e a principle of a&s;&s;o|ciation
among ideas. The conception of any
object naturally carries the thought to the idea
of another object which was connected with it
either in place or in time. Mention one
hou&s;e in a city, or one &s;eat in a country with
which we are acquainted, we naturally think
and talk of others adjacent; and frequently
when we are not acquainted with them, we
even make an effort to imagine them. Bring
us to a place where we have formerly been,
or only &s;peak of it, immediately ideas of per|&s;ons
whom we have &s;een, of conver&s;ations in
which we have been engaged, of actions
which we have done, or of &s;cenes which we
have witne&s;&s;ed, in that place or near it, croud
into our mind.</P>

<P>If any event be mentioned, the mind very
naturally &s;ets out from it, and goes on recol|lecting

Nothing is more common than for an hi&s;to|rian
to introduce the relation of an event no|wi&s;e
related to his &s;ubject, with this ob&s;erva|tion,
<PB N="117" REF="124">
that it happened in the place or about
the time of which he is writing. The pro|lixity
of circum&s;tantial and involved &s;tory|tellers
often ari&s;es wholly from this, that
they croud into their narration, a multitude
of circum&s;tances which have no connexion
with the thread of it, but have happened to
be contiguous in place or in time to &s;ome
particular incidents, and are continually &s;ug|ge&s;ted

the time of Oates's plot, that a cou&s;in|german
and I were at the Bear in Holburn,&mdash;Jack

was &s;poken &s;omewhere thereabouts, for we
drank a bottle in that neighbourhood every
evening<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">SPECTATOR, No. 138.</NOTE>.&endq; The occa&s;ion of the &s;tory is &s;ugge&s;ted by means of re&s;emblance; all the
circum&s;tances of the &s;tory which we have
tran&s;cribed are &s;ugge&s;ted only by vicinity.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="125">
THERE are other qualities or relations of a
compound nature, which fit ideas for being
a&s;&s;ociated and for introducing one another.
They are produced by the union of the &s;imple
relations already mentioned, with one another
or with other circum&s;tances. Such are <HI>co|exi&s;tence,
the relation of cau&s;e and effect,</HI> and
<HI>order.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN qualities are co-exi&s;tent in any ob|ject,
they are conceived by the mind as con|nected
both in time and in place, and this
connexion is regarded as con&s;tant and per|manent
The&s;e relations of the parts have &s;o
great influence on the mind, and connect the
ideas of the parts &s;o &s;trongly in the imagina|tion,
that we conceive them all with almo&s;t
as great facility as we could conceive any one
of them. On this account we be&s;tow unity
on the whole collection, and con&s;ider them all
as making but one perception. We have &s;o
&s;trong a propen&s;ity to this, that it co&s;ts us
&s;ome trouble to analy&s;e a complex perception
into its parts; and indeed this is &s;eldom at|tempted
by the generality of mankind. A
number of di&s;tinct perceptions being thus
united, by co-exi&s;tence, in the imagination,
any one of them occurring to the mind, &s;ug|ge&s;ts
the re&s;t. If we &s;inell any fruit at a di&s;|tance,
<PB N="119" REF="126">
we immediately conceive its colour,
&s;hape, and ta&s;te. If we &s;hould find one wheel
of a watch, or one part of a machine in a
de&s;ert, it would call up the idea of the ma|chine
to which it belongs.</P>
<P>THE relation of cau&s;e and effect, which
likewi&s;e fits ideas for being a&s;&s;ociated, is a
compound relation: it includes conjunction in
place, for the cau&s;e is always conceived as
contiguous to its effect; it includes conjunc|tion
in time, for the cau&s;e is always prior to
the effect; and the cau&s;e is always &s;uppo&s;ed
to exert power or energy in producing the
effect, or at lea&s;t to have &s;omehow a fitne&s;s to
produce it, &s;o that the effect has a depend|ence
upon that cau&s;e<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Cau&s;a autem ca e&s;t, quae id efficit, cujus e&s;t cau&s;a, ut vulnus, mortis; cruditas, morbi; ignis, ardoris. Itaque non &s;ic cau&s;a intelligi debet, ut, quod cuique antecedat, id ei cau&s;a &s;it, &s;ed quod cuique efficienter antecedat. Cic. <HI>de Fato.</HI></NOTE>. The conception of
a cau&s;e naturally leads us to think of the
effect; and the conception of an effect as na|turally
conveys our thought to the idea of
the cau&s;e. The &s;ight of a wound leads us
immediately to conceive both the pain which
it occa&s;ions, and the weapon by which it was
produced. Thinking of any per&s;on, we na|turally
recollect &s;ome action of which he was
the author. Thinking of any tran&s;action, we
<PB N="120" REF="127">
naturally recollet the per&s;ons who were con|cerned
in it, and even reflect on other parts
of their behaviour. The pre&s;ence or the men|tion
of the &s;on of a friend, naturally intro|duces
the idea of the father.</P>
<P>IT was remarked formerly that in every
work of genius, all the parts are connected
with the de&s;ign, and that the &s;trength of that
a&s;&s;ociating principle by which they are con|nected
with it, produces <HI>regularity</HI> of imagi|nation.
We may now ob&s;erve that this con|nexion
which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the parts and
the de&s;ign, and in general the connexion be|tween
all means and their end, is a &s;pecies of
the relation of cau&s;e and effect. Every part
of a regular work, both in &s;cience and in the
arts, either immediately promotes the de&s;ign,
or is &s;ub&s;ervient to &s;ome other part which
promotes it. When a per&s;on has a di&s;tinct
view, and a &s;trong and &s;teady perception of
the de&s;ign, it will lead him to conceive all the
&s;ubordinate ends which mu&s;t be attained in
order to accompli&s;h the main de&s;ign, and
which, in re&s;pect of it, are means or imme|diate
cau&s;es. Each of the&s;e &s;ubordinate ends
will &s;ugge&s;t the means by which it may be
effected, keeping the ultimate de&s;ign at the
&s;ame time con&s;tantly in view. Thus, by the
<PB N="121" REF="128">
a&s;&s;ociating force of cau&s;e and effect, the whole
out-lines of the work will be at once pre&s;ented
to the mind; and partly by means of this
relation, and partly by means of other rela|tions
they will introduce all the conceptions
which are requi&s;ite for fini&s;hing it. What|ever
conception is introduced, fir&s;t the &s;ubor|dinate
ends, and next, by their influence,
the ultimate end will recur to the thought,
and di&s;po&s;e us either to adopt the conception
as &s;uitable, or to reject it as un&s;erviceable.
When a per&s;on has a lively and con&s;ant view
of the end of a work, it will produce an ha|bitual
&s;en&s;e that he is in &s;earch of means fit
to promote that end, though perhaps he does
not often explicitly reflect upon it. The
&s;en&s;e of this will keep his imagination in a
preparation and di&s;po&s;ition for being peculi|arly
affected with the relation between the
means and the end. In con&s;equence of this,
not only does the end &s;ugge&s;t the natural
means of promoting it, but moreover what|ever
idea almo&s;t occurs to the mind, the per|&s;on
has a tendency to view it on all &s;ides, on
purpo&s;e to &s;ee whether it can in any way con|tribute
to that end, the perception of which
dwells continually on his imagination. The
effects of a &s;trong a&s;&s;ociation of the de&s;ign,
<PB N="122" REF="129">
were formerly pointed out; the ob&s;ervations
now made, explain what this a&s;&s;ociation of
the de&s;ign is, and how it is fitted for produ|cing
the&s;e effects.</P>
<P>ORDER evidently produces a &s;trong con|nexion
between ideas, and gives one great
power to introduce others. It is a com|pounded
relation which may take place either
between the parts of the &s;ame thing or be|tween
different things. Order ari&s;es from
things being united or placed together, ac|cording
as they are more clo&s;ely related.
When the parts of a machine are properly
combined, they have order; if they be either
laid in a heap, or any of them mi&s;placed, the
order is de&s;troyed. In a regular treati&s;e on
any &s;ubject, order is pre&s;erved through the
whole; in a &s;et of aphori&s;ms there is no order.
In the former ca&s;e, one part very readily
&s;ugge&s;ts the re&s;t; in the latter, it is not &s;o.
It is this principle of order that gives the parts
of any regular &s;y&s;te a peculiar power to
&s;ugge&s; ideas both of the other parts and of
the whole. By means of it, the parts of an
edifice have a &s;tricter union in the imagina|tion,
than the parts of a heap of &s;tones; the
parts of a plant or of an animal body in their
united &s;ate, are more clo&s;ely a&s;&s;ociated than
<PB N="123" REF="130">
they would be if they were di&s;united and yet
huddled into a narrower compa&s;s. By means
of the &s;ame principle, an event will &s;ugge&s;t
another on which it had an influence, much
more ea&s;ily than one with which it had no
connexion, though contemporary or immedi|ately
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive. We run with great facility
over a train of perceptions in order; but if
we neglect their order, the mind finds great
difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing from one of them to the
others.</P>
<P>ALL the relations of ideas, which fit them
for being a&s;&s;ociated, are reducible to tho&s;e
that have been mentioned. We often ima|gine
that &s;ome of the&s;e relations belong to
ideas to which they do not belong: but in
this ca&s;e, as we are not &s;en&s;ible of our mi&s;|take,
they produce, though they be merely
imaginary, as &s;trong a&s;&s;ociation as if they had
been real.</P>
<P>BEFORE we fini&s;h this part of the &s;ubject,
it will not be improper to ob&s;erve, That the&s;e
&s;eveal relations or qualities of ideas operate
upon the imagination in an in&s;tinctive or me|chanical
way, that is, without our reflecting
that they belong to the ideas. When one
idea has &s;ugge&s;ted another, we di&s;cover on
comparing them, that they do, for in&s;tance,
<PB N="124" REF="131">
re&s;emble each other: but it was not a pre|vious
perception of their re&s;emblance that
made the one to &s;ugge&s;t the other; it &s;ug|ge&s;ted
it in&s;tinctively without our perceiving
at the time, how or wherefore it &s;ugge&s;ted it.
Hence, though a&s;&s;ociation of all the kinds
that have been mentioned, is natural to all
men, yet every man is &s;o far from knowing
di&s;tinctly the qualities and relations of ideas
which produce a&s;&s;ociation, that the enumera|tion
of them is but a recent di&s;covery among
philo&s;ophers them&s;elves. Before two percep|tions
can be compared, they mu&s;t be both
pre&s;ent to the mind; but except it happen
that both are exhibited together by &s;en&s;e or
memory, one of them becomes pre&s;ent to the
mind only by its being &s;ugge&s;ted by the
other, by means of &s;ome of the relations
which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between them, operating mecha|nically
on the imagination. In mo&s;t ca&s;es
indeed, the relations of the ideas have been
often perceived; and the oftener they have
been attended to, and the more di&s;inctly they
are apprehended, the more &s;trongly will the
ideas be a&s;&s;ociated and the more readily will
one of them &s;ugge&s;t the other. Imaginary,
groundle&s;s, and unnatural a&s;&s;ociations of ideas,
always pre&s;uppo&s;e an opinion, though a fal&s;e
<PB N="125" REF="132">
opinion, &s;omehow imbibed of their being re|lated;
but after this opinion is formed, the
&s;uppo&s;ed connexion operates on the imagina|tion,
mechanically, and without our reflecting
on its original foundation. In the &s;ame me|chanical
manner the real relations of ideas,
even &s;uch as have been mo&s;t frequently re|flected
upon, act on the imagination in &s;ug|ge&s;ting
one another; the previous compari|&s;ons
of the ideas, and perceptions of their
relations, are only cau&s;es which contribute to
their acting with the greater force.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Influence of Habit on A&s;&s;ociation.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall next enquire, What other
principles there are in the human
con&s;titution, which affect the a&s;&s;ociation of
ideas &s;o as to make &s;ome to unite more readily
than others, equally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the a&s;&s;ociating
qualities or relations ju&s;t now enumerated.
There are two principles of this kind, who&s;e
influence is very evident; <HI>habit,</HI> and <HI>the pa&s;|&s;ions.</HI>
Any pre&s;ent perception introduces
&s;uch ideas related to it, as we have been ac|cu&s;tomed
to, and &s;uch as are congruous to
<PB N="126" REF="133">
the pa&s;&s;ion which influences us at the time,
much more readily than others which are
equally related to that perception. Both the&s;e
principles not only affect in this manner the
introduction of ideas which are a&s;&s;ociated by
means of relations &s;ubsiting between them,
but are likewi&s;e them&s;elves di&s;tinct and &s;epa|rate
cau&s;es of a&s;&s;ociation: habit, or a pre&s;ent
pa&s;&s;ion, often &s;ugge&s;ts trains of ideas which
derive their connexion, not from their rela|tion
to one another, but chiefly from their
congruity to the habit or the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider habit as determining
&s;ome related ideas to be more readily a&s;&s;ociat|ed
than others equally related, its effects are
chiefly the three following.</P>
<P>FIRST, An idea which cu&s;tom has render|ed
familiar to us, will be more ea&s;ily intro|duced
by any pre&s;ent perception, than an|other
idea which is equally related to that
perception, but which we are little accu&s;tomed
to think upon. This effect of habit is very
con&s;picuous, not only in common life, but
likewi&s;e in all works of genius. It was re|marked
before, that per&s;ons in the habits of
the modern religious orders are introduced
into many pictures repre&s;enting parts of the
go&s;pel hi&s;tory, and that a very little exerci&s;e
<PB N="127" REF="134">
of judgment would have directed the painter
to reject this ab&s;urdity as &s;oon as it came into
his thoughts: but glaring as the ab&s;urdity is,
it is by no means &s;urpri&s;ing that it &s;hould
come into the thoughts of a popi&s;h painter.
He is &s;o much accu&s;tomed to &s;ee the religious
of his church, and they are &s;o invariably
bearing a part in every action of a &s;acred na|ture,
of which he can be a &s;pecator, that ha|bit
can &s;carce fail to bring them into his
view, whenever the &s;ubject of his work has
any the &s;lighte&s;t relation to them. There are
&s;ome objects and appearances of objects in
nature, open and obvious to the ob&s;ervation
of all, and therefore rendered by cu&s;tom fa|miliar
to all. The&s;e objects and appearances
&s;upply the &s;imilitudes and images which have
been mo&s;t early appropriated, and mo&s;t fre|quently
u&s;ed by poets and orators. The rea|&s;on
is plain; becau&s;e re&s;emblance and habit
united their force in &s;ugge&s;ting them, they
occurred more readily than images which
were &s;ugge&s;ted by re&s;emblance alone. When
a writer abounds in images of this kind, and
in them only, we are apt to pronounce with|out
he&s;itation, that he is a mere imitator.
But this judgment is too ha&s;tly: the &s;ame
cau&s;e which has rendered the&s;e images trite
<PB N="128" REF="135">
and common, will always make a per&s;on of
indifferent genius to run into them, even
without imitation. Images from objects and
appearances which are not very common, can|not
be &s;ugge&s;ted to a per&s;on, except his ima|gination
be lively, &s;o that the a&s;&s;ociating
principle of re&s;emblance be vigorous enough
to introduce them without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from
habit; and therefore a per&s;on who has a weak
imagination, is almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily confined to
images taken from things who&s;e familiarity
has made them already occur to many. Thus
the mo&s;t common defect of genius in poets
and orators, is a &s;triking in&s;tance of the power
which habit has to a&s;&s;i&s;t the operation of the
a&s;&s;ociating qualities of ideas. Its power is
likewi&s;e evident in authors and arti&s;ts of the
greate&s;t genius. A painter of real genius will
always repre&s;ent, and a poet of real genius
will always draw his images from that &s;tate
and face of nature which occurs in the places
he is acquainted with, and tho&s;e objects and
appearances which he him&s;elf has had occa&s;ion
to ob&s;erve; and by this means he often di&s;|tingui&s;hes
him&s;elf from imitators, who not
having genius &s;ufficient for ob&s;erving the
great original, Nature, the real appearances
of things exhibited to them&s;elves, de&s;cribe
<PB N="129" REF="136">
them as they have been already de&s;cribed by
others in &s;ituations totally different. But in
the&s;e imitators too, the force of cu&s;tom in
facilitating the introduction of ideas, is ob|&s;ervable:
they have often attended to the de|&s;criptions
of others, they have &s;eldom been
&s;truck with the originals in Nature; by this
means the repre&s;entations of others are more
familiar to them than any images of their
own; and that is the rea&s;on why they more
readily occur to them.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on is intent on a particular
&s;tudy, or meditating any work of genius,
when in con&s;equence of this his thoughts
cu&s;tomarily dwell upon it, every thing that
occurs to him in reading, in conver&s;ation or
in life, immediately brings his pre&s;ent work
or &s;tudy into his view, and &s;ets him on think|ing,
whether, and in what manner, it may
be accommodated to that work or &s;tudy, and
rendered u&s;eful in them. Had the &s;ame thing
occurred to a per&s;on engaged in a different
pur&s;uit, it would have led him, by the &s;ame
principle, to apply it to a quite different pur|po&s;e.
The example that was la&s;t produced,
&s;ugge&s;ts an illu&s;tration of this remark. An
ingenious modern critic being employed in
a&s;certaining the marks of imitation, took no|tice
<PB N="130" REF="137">
that &s;ome of the Engli&s;h poets de&s;cribe
the Spring, not as they have ob&s;erved it in
their own climate, but as they have been ac|cu&s;tomed
to &s;ee it de&s;cribed by the poets of
warmer regions, who painted what they really
experienced: this, in conformity to the de&s;ign
which occupied his thoughts, &s;ugge&s;ted to
him one mark of imitation, &startq;That where the
local peculiarities of Nature are to be de|&s;cribed,
there an exact conformity of the
matter will evince an imitation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>HURD's</HI> Letter to Mr. Ma&s;on, on the Marks of Imitation.</NOTE>.&endq; The
writer of this e&s;&s;ay finding this ob&s;ervation in
that ingenious critic, it occurred to him, that
it might be applied in both its parts, for ex|emplifying
the force of cu&s;tom in promoting
the introduction of ideas connected by &s;ome of
the a&s;&s;ociating qualities. To a third per&s;on it
might have &s;ugge&s;ted &s;omething totally dif|ferent,
but &s;uitable to the particular purpo&s;e
which happened to be mo&s;t familiar to him at
the time.</P>
<P>EVERY profe&s;&s;ion or way of life renders a
corre&s;pondent &s;et of ideas familiar to a per|&s;on;
and in con&s;quence of this, the fame
object frequently leads different per&s;ons into
totally different tracks of thinking. A plant
which &s;ugge&s;ts an image or de&s;cription to a
<PB N="131" REF="138">
poet, will engage the botani&s;t in determining
to what cla&s;s it belongs, the chemi&s;t in think|ing
of the proce&s;s by which it may be ana|ly&s;ed,
and the phy&s;ician in con&s;idering its
virtues as a medicine. The view of the hea|vens
in a fine evening will lead the thoughts
of the a&s;tronomer to the &s;y&s;tem of the uni|ver&s;e,
will make the painter conceive a land|&s;cape,
will &s;upply the poet with noble image|ry,
and engage the divine in a train of
religious meditation. Mention an event or
tell a &s;tory in a mixt company, it will &s;ugge&s;t
to, perhaps, every individual of the com|pany,
different thoughts or reflections; but
what it &s;ugge&s;ts to each, will generally be
&s;omething which his own habitual cour&s;e of
life or a pre&s;ent accident renders familiar to
him. Tell the news of a battle, or &s;peak of
a per&s;on who has fallen in it; the ladies ex|pre&s;s
their &s;ympathy with the wives or mo|thers
of the &s;lain; the merchant takes notice
in what manner trade is affected by the war;
the &s;oldier &s;peaks of the glory of dying in the
field, or relates his own campaigns, exploits,
and wounds; the politician in&s;tructs the com|pany
concerning the origin of the war, the
motives to it, and the advantages or the lo&s;&s;es
to be derived from it; the &s;cholar recollects
<PB N="132" REF="139">
&s;ome battle rendered famous by cla&s;&s;ical de|&s;cription,
or traces the revolutions in the art
of war; and if there be a poet in the circle,
he will perhaps, inattentive to all that pa&s;&s;es,
be employed in forming &s;ilently a lively con|ception
of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e in&s;tances it is plain that cu&s;tom
gives great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to any of the a&s;&s;ociating
qualities with which it happens to co-operate,
and makes them introduce an idea that is fa|miliar
to us rather than another le&s;s familiar,
though to this latter the&s;e qualities equally
belong. Conceptions to which we are not
accu&s;tomed, are &s;hy to enter into the mind;
it requires a &s;ort of force to bring them into
view; they mu&s;t have a very &s;trong relation to
the pre&s;ent perception before it be able to in|troduce
them. But cu&s;tom gives the ideas
which it has rendered familiar, a tendency to
occur; they &s;tand ready, as it were, to enter
on the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion; we have a &s;trong
propen&s;ity to think of them; any relation to
the pre&s;ent object of thought, however weak,
will be &s;ufficient to introduce them; and a
&s;trong relation to it, will &s;ugge&s;t them with
the greate&s;t ea&s;e and quickne&s;s. The di&s;po&s;i|tion
of our mind towards familiar ideas, is
thus analogous to our inclination towards our
<PB N="133" REF="140">
acquaintance; it is with a &s;ort of reluctance,
or not without &s;ome ceremony, that we go
into the company of &s;trangers; but we need
&s;mall inducement to &s;eek the company of an
old friend; we enter into it with perfect ea&s;e,
nay cannot without difficulty be re&s;trained
from entering into it.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, cu&s;tom renders us more apt to
be affected with one of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities
than with others. We &s;hall have occa&s;ion to
ob&s;erve afterwards, that by the original con|&s;titution
of nature, the imagination is often
more apt to be affected with one of the a&s;&s;o|ciating
qualities than with the re&s;t. This
natural propen&s;ity may give occa&s;ion to a ha|bit
of following chiefly one of them. But
though the mind were by nature equally open
to the influence of all the a&s;&s;ociating qualities,
yet various accidents may lead a per&s;on to be
influenced for a con&s;iderable time together,
by one a&s;&s;ociating quality only, or by one
much oftener than by others. Whenever
this happens, a habit will be acquired of pa&s;|&s;ing
from one perception to another, by
means chiefly of that a&s;&s;ociating quality; and
that habit once formed, will produce a pro|pen&s;ity
to continue &s;till to trace perceptions
principally by that particular quality, or will
<PB N="134" REF="141">
add &s;trength to the propen&s;ity which was de|rived
from nature. This ob&s;ervation might
be confirmed by a multitude of in&s;tances.
Let a per&s;on who has been much accu&s;tomed
to mathematical &s;tudies, write on the mo&s;t
di&s;&s;imilar &s;ubjects, he not only throws his
treati&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible into the mathe|matical
form, but is di&s;po&s;ed to &s;eek for and
conceive relations between his ideas, re&s;em|bling
the mathematical relations. It was per|haps
the habit of attending to the mathe|matical
&s;ciences, that di&s;po&s;ed Dr. Clark to
explain the foundation of morals, in the
manner in which he has explained it, to
place it in fitne&s;s or congruity, and to deduce
that congruity from ab&s;tract relations, in&s;tead
of referring it to the con&s;titution of man, or
to the moral nature of God. If a per&s;on has
confined his reading for a con&s;iderable time to
the works of poets, he will find a di&s;po&s;ition,
e&s;pecially if his own &s;tile be not yet perfectly
formed, to write on every &s;ubject in a figura|tive
and poetical manner. In general, a per|&s;on's
manner of writing is formed in a great
degree, by the manner of tho&s;e authors whom
he has been mo&s;t accu&s;tomed to &s;tudy: he
pur&s;ucs his thoughts in the &s;ame paths, di&s;|po&s;es
them by means of &s;imilar relations, and
<PB N="135" REF="142">
even arranges his expre&s;&s;ions, without reflec|tion,
upon the &s;ame principles. This ob&s;er|vation,
is equally applicable to painters, and
arti&s;ts of every kind.</P>
<P>BUT we need not multiply examples of the
power of cu&s;tom in di&s;po&s;ing us to follow one
a&s;&s;ociating quality in preference to others;
for many of tho&s;e which we have produced
under the former head, are appo&s;ite to our
pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. It is not only the familiarity
of the ideas which are &s;uitable to our &s;ituation
and manner of life, that renders them &s;it to
be a&s;&s;ociated with any pre&s;ent perception, but
al&s;o their being connected with that percep|tion
by a relation which our &s;ituation or man|ner
of life has made familiar, and given us a
habit of being affected by. When the &s;ame
object &s;ugge&s;ts different ideas to different per|&s;ons,
the&s;e ideas are &s;ometimes connected with
that object by the &s;ame relation; but gene|rally
they are connected with it by different
relations, and the idea &s;ugge&s;ted to a particu|lar
per&s;on, is &s;uch as bears that relation to
the pre&s;ent object, which he is by habit or
otherwi&s;e mo&s;t prone to follow. By be&s;tow|ing
a very &s;mall degree of attention, this may
be ob&s;erved in almo&s;t all the examples already
given of the force of cu&s;tom in facilitating the
<PB N="136" REF="143">
introduction of familiar ideas: I &s;hall point
it out only in one of them. The &s;ame plant,
it was remarked, may &s;ugge&s;t different ideas
to per&s;ons of different profe&s;&s;ions: it is by
re&s;emblance that it &s;ugge&s;ts an image to the
poet, and re&s;emblance is the relation by which
he is mo&s;t accu&s;tomed to be affected; it is by
the relation of cau&s;e and effect that it &s;ugge&s;ts
the con&s;ideration of its elements to the che|mi&s;t,
and of its virtues to the phy&s;ician, and
that is the relation which their &s;tudies render
mo&s;t familiar to them.</P>
<P>THUS, if nature has given a per&s;on a pecu|liar
pronene&s;s to follow &s;ome one of the a&s;&s;o|ciating
relations, the impul&s;e of nature will
gradually produce an habit of following that
relation mo&s;t frequently; and as &s;oon as that
habit is produced, it will &s;trengthen the natu|ral
pronene&s;s: or if &s;uch a habit be produced
by accidental cau&s;es, it will of it&s;elf, without
any affi&s;tance from the natural con&s;tution of
the mind, beget a &s;uitable propen&s;ity. Rela|tions
which we are accu&s;tomed to follow in the
train of our thoughts, are like roads with
which we are acquainted, and in which we
therefore pur&s;ue a journey without any con|cern,
he&s;itation, or deviation.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="144">
IT will not perhaps be &s;uperfluous to re|mark
farther, that it is not only long cu&s;tom
which produces this effect: the &s;horte&s;t cu&s;|tom,
&s;uch as cannot with propriety be &s;aid to
amount to a habit, is &s;ufficient. When a per|&s;on
has been occa&s;ionally, for ever &s;o &s;hort a
time, affected by one a&s;&s;ociating quality, he
acquires a propen&s;ity to continue to be affect|ed
by that quality. When one has been any|how
led to u&s;e &s;everal images or &s;imilitudes in
a compo&s;ition, he is prone for &s;ome time to
run into the &s;ame figures. A metaphor once
employed, gives a per&s;on a di&s;po&s;ition to pur|&s;ue
it, by means of which it is &s;ometimes &s;o
long continued as to produce an allegory. A
few contra&s;ts or antithe&s;es naturally and of
cour&s;e lead an author into more. An exam|ple
formerly produced of a&s;&s;ociation by means
of contrariety<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The example from Clifford's &s;peech to Henry VI. p. 115.</NOTE>, affords a plain proof of the
influence of a very tran&s;ient cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Cu&s;tom not only renders one
a&s;&s;ociating quality more ready to affect us,
than other qualities; it likewi&s;e renders the
&s;ame quality readier to operate on the imagi|nation
after one particular manner than after
another manner. We &s;hall hereafter have
<PB N="138" REF="145">
occa&s;ion to examine the different forms which
the &s;ame a&s;&s;ociating quality a&s;&s;umes, or the
different ways in which it operates in intro|ducing
ideas. In general, it is evident that
there are very different forms or &s;pecies of
each of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities; for in&s;tance,
things <HI>re&s;emble</HI> one another in many different
ways. Now one &s;ort of re&s;emblance may be
a powerful principle of a&s;&s;ociation, to a par|ticular
per&s;on on whom other &s;orts of re&s;em|blance
have very little influence; and the
propen&s;ity of that per&s;on to be affected chiefly
by this one &s;ort, often proceeds, at lea&s;t in
part, from his having acquired a habit of
being affected by it. An example formerly
made u&s;e of, may be applied for the illu&s;tra|tion
of this. A plant &s;ugge&s;ts an image to a
poet, and leads a botani&s;t to think of the cla&s;s
to which it belongs; it operates on the ima|ginations
of both, by <HI>re&s;emblance;</HI> on the
poet, by the re&s;emblance of its general ap|pearance,
or of &s;ome of its particular quali|ties,
to a di&s;tant &s;ubject; on the botani&s;t, by
the exact re&s;emblance of its parts to indivi|duals
of the &s;ame kind. But the&s;e two &s;orts
of re&s;emblance are almo&s;t as different from
one another as re&s;emblance is from vicinity:
no two turns of imagination are more unlike
<PB N="139" REF="146">
than that of the poet and that of the natural
hi&s;torian. Both are in this in&s;tance affected
by the re&s;emblance which the idea &s;ugge&s;ted
bears to the pre&s;ent object; but the one of
them is in no degree affected by the particu|lar
&s;pecies of re&s;emblance which affects the
other. Every one almo&s;t of the a&s;&s;ociating
qualities is capable of as great variety as re|&s;emblace.
Now as a per&s;on may derive
from nature, a propen&s;ity to be influenced by
any of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities in one particu|lar
way rather than in another way, &s;o by
his being accu&s;tomed to be thus influenced,
that propen&s;ity will be increa&s;ed. After the
ob&s;ervations which have been already made,
little needs to be &s;aid for confirmation of this.
It is as ea&s;y to conceive how a per&s;on may
acquire a habit of being affected by an a&s;&s;o|ciating
quality in one particular manner, as
to conceive how he may acquire a habit of
being affected by one quality more than by
others: and when it has been proved that in
the latter ca&s;e the habit begets a facility in
tracing ideas by that one quality to which a
per&s;on has been accu&s;tomed, it will ea&s;ily be
allowed that the habit mu&s;t have equal force
in di&s;po&s;ing us to a particular mode of a&s;&s;oci|ation
by any quality. To recur to a former in|&s;tance,
<PB N="140" REF="147">
there can be no doubt that it is partly
by their cu&s;tomary &s;tudies, as well as by the
natural turn of their imaginations, that the
poet and the botani&s;t are led by the plant pre|&s;ented
to them, to ideas connected with it by
very different &s;orts of re&s;emblance; and that
the chemi&s;t and the phy&s;ician, though both
influenced by the relation of cau&s;e and effect,
are yet influenced by very different &s;pecies of
that relation, and led, one to think of the ele|ments
of which the plant is compo&s;ed, and
the other to trace its effects on animal bodies.
Both in &s;imilitude and in metaphor, the
image is connected with the &s;ubjet by re&s;em|blance;
but a per&s;on may be rendered by
cu&s;tom readier to expre&s;s him&s;elf in one of
the&s;e figures than in the other.</P>
<P>IT is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the&s;e effects
of habit, that it frequently oppo&s;es and over|balances
the in&s;luence of the a&s;&s;ociating qua|lities.
A perception is pre&s;ent to the mind;
one idea is very &s;trongly connected with it by
re&s;emblance, or by &s;ome other relation; an|other
idea is weakly related to it, but is ei|ther
familiar to us, or is related by a tie or a
modification of a tie which we have been
much accu&s;tomed to follow: the relations of
ideas would introduce the former, but cu&s;tom
<PB N="141" REF="148">
often overpowers them, and gains the pre|ference
to the latter. Cu&s;tom &s;ometimes co|operates
with relations; and in that ca&s;e it
augments their force: but &s;ometimes it coun|teracts
them; and whenever it does &s;o, it
weakens or totally de&s;troys their influence.
By this means the mind is often prevented
from pur&s;uing a train of thought through
the &s;tronge&s;t connexions, as it naturally would
if it were not influenced by habit. This is
the cau&s;e of many tran&s;iti&oacute;ns in authors and
in conver&s;ation, which appear unnatural, and
are unaccountable to tho&s;e who have not the
&s;ame habits.</P>
<P>HITHERTO we have &s;uppo&s;ed the percep|tions
which introduce one another, to be really
related by &s;ome of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities
formerly enumerated, and have &s;hewn how
habit a&s;&s;i&s;ts or ob&s;tructs the operation of the&s;e
qualities, or in what ways it affects the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of perceptions. But cu&s;tom will like|wi&s;e
produce an union between perceptions
which are not otherwi&s;e related. Though
two perceptions have no natural bond of
union, yet if they have happened to be pre|&s;ented
often together, one of them can &s;carce
ever appear afterwards without introducing
the other. In this ca&s;e, as the connexion ari&s;es
<PB N="142" REF="149">
wholly from the force of habit, &s;o the degree
of that connexion is in proportion to the
&s;trength of the habit, or to the number of in|&s;tances
in which the perceptions have occurred
together. Many examples of the power of
cu&s;tom to beget an a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, have
been often taken notice of: but though there
were no other, language alone would be a &s;uf|ficient
proof of this. The words of any lan|guage
have no natural connexion with the
perceptions which they expre&s;s. They owe
their &s;ignification wholly to compact: yet by
cu&s;tom they acquire &s;o firm a connexion with
&s;entiments, that no &s;ooner is a word in a
known language pronounced, than it excites
the idea which it has been u&s;ed for expre&s;&s;ing,
and no &s;ooner does a thought &s;tart up in the
mind, than it &s;ugge&s;ts a word corre&s;pondent
to it. Cu&s;tom has be&s;towed upon them an
indi&s;&s;oluble connexion; and the mo&s;t igno|rant
&s;carce imagine that they have any con|nexion
except that which cu&s;tom has be|&s;towed.
In language we perceive likewi&s;e,
that the &s;trength of the a&s;&s;ociation is in pro|portion
to the &s;trength of the habit. If a
per&s;on be but imperfectly accu&s;tomed to a
language, or have been long without the habit
of u&s;ing it, the words of that language, though
<PB N="143" REF="150">
he be acquainted with them, do not, by being
pronounced, &s;ugge&s;t &s;o quickly the ideas &s;ig|nified
by them, nor are them&s;elves &s;o readily
&s;ugge&s;ted, when he wants to expre&s;s his own
&s;entiments, as the words of a language to
which he has been much and con&s;tantly ac|cu&s;tomed.
A per&s;on for &s;ome time &s;peaks
with he&s;itation, and under&s;tands with diffi|iculty
a foreign language, though he knows
the words that are employed; but he &s;peaks
his mother-tongue readily, and under&s;tands it
with ea&s;e<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The connexion e&s;tabli&s;hed by cu&s;tom, between ideas and the words of a language, being mutual, it may perhaps be thought, that the ideas &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t the words, and the words the ideas, with equal quickne&s;s and ea&s;e. But this is not the ca&s;e. The tran&s;ition from the words to the ideas, is generally much ea&s;ier than that from the ideas to the words. A per&s;on who is learning a &s;trange language, will be able to under&s;tand a book or a conver&s;ation in that language long before he can write or &s;peak it. Even in one's native tongue, one can rea|dily under&s;tand what is written or &s;poken in the be&s;t and pro|pere&s;t terms, though he could not have u&s;ed the&s;e terms for ex|pre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame ideas; and many write or &s;peak with difficulty and he&s;itation, who under&s;tand what they read or hear, with perfect ea&s;e. This proceeds from the fir&s;t principle which we have e&s;tabli&s;hed concerning the influence of cu&s;tom upon a&s;&s;o|ciation, and is a new in&s;tance for confirming and illu&s;trating that principle. The ideas are more <HI>familiar</HI> to us than the words; they are often rai&s;ed by their proper objects, or &s;ug|ge&s;ted by other words; they often make their appearance in the mind, and are applied to various purpo&s;es, when the names of them are not thought upon; and their <HI>familiarity</HI> makes them to be &s;ugge&s;ted readily. That this is the true cau&s;e, is confirmed by ob&s;erving that where it does not take place, ideas are not &s;ugge&s;ted more readily than words are in ordinary ca&s;es. When the ideas expre&s;&s;ed are &s;uch as we have been little accu&s;tomed to attened to, a di&s;cour&s;e or compo&s;ition is under&s;tand by us with difficulty, as well as when ideas are expre&s;&s;ed by unu&s;ual words: they are not familiar to us, and therefore are not redily &s;ugge&s;ted.</NOTE>. There is &s;carce any per&s;on but
has &s;ome favourite words and phra&s;es, which
continually occur both in his conver&s;ation and
<PB N="144" REF="151">
in his writings, though there be many others
in the language, equally fit for expre&s;&s;ing the
&s;ame thought. The former having by &s;ome
means or other been frequently u&s;ed by him,
and on that account become familiar to him,
ru&s;h into his mind of their own accord, when|ever
the idea to which they corre&s;pond, is
pre&s;ent. But if at any time, di&s;gu&s;ted with
the frequency of the&s;e terms, he be de&s;irous
of diver&s;ifying his &s;tile, it requires &s;ome time
and &s;tudied efforts to recollect the &s;ynonymous
terms that are le&s;s familiar to him, though he
knows them perfectly well. They are but
weakly connected by cu&s;tom with his ideas,
and therefore they come not quickly into his
mind. Thus habit not only a&s;&s;i&s;ts the a&s;&s;oci|ating
qualities in introducing ideas, but like|wi&s;e
it&s;elf unites ideas to which none of the
a&s;&s;ociating qualities belong.</P>
<P>WE may farther remark an effect of habit
on the imagination, different from both the&s;e.
If a per&s;on has accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to any
particular object or action while he was em|ployed
in pur&s;uing a train of ideas, that ob|ject
<PB N="145" REF="152">
or action becomes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for
his pur&s;uing any train. Without it, ideas,
though connected by relations as &s;trong as
po&s;&s;ible, cannot introduce one another; by
means of it, they are readily &s;ugge&s;ted: yet
the accu&s;tomed object or action has no more
connexion with any one train than with any
other, nor &s;eems capable of either a&s;&s;i&s;ting
the relations which already unite the ideas,
or be&s;towing any new relation upon them. A
per&s;on may by cu&s;tom become unable to think
or di&s;cour&s;e of a &s;ubject, without keeping his
eye fixt in a particular direction, or indulging
him&s;elf in &s;ome u&s;ual po&s;ure or motion. De|prive
&s;ome per&s;ons of a &s;nuff-box, imme|diately
fancy is extingui&s;hed, and a regular
or fluent &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas can no longer
take place. &startq;I &s;at by an eminent &s;tory-teller
and politician,&endq; &s;ays an ingenious writer;
&startq;I ob&s;erved this gentleman t'other day in
the mid&s;t of a &s;tory diverted from it by
looking at &s;omething at a di&s;tance, and I
&s;oftly hid his box. But he returns to his
tale, and looking for his box, he cries, <HI>and
&s;o, Sir</HI>&mdash;Then when he &s;hould have taken
a pinch, as <HI>I was &s;aying,</HI> &s;ays he,&mdash;<HI>Has no

turning to me; <HI>Pray, Sir, did you &s;ee my

his tale, and I took notice that his dulne&s;s
was much more regular and fluent than
before<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">TATLER, No. 35.</NOTE>.&endq; &startq;I remember,&endq; &s;ays Mr.

u&s;ed to frequent We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, there
was a coun&s;ellor who never pleaded with|out
a piece of pack-thread in his hand,
which he u&s;ed to twi&s;t about a thumb or a
finger, all the while he was &s;peaking: the
wags of tho&s;e days u&s;ed to call it the thread
of his di&s;cour&s;e, for he was not able to utter
a word without it. One of his clients, who
was more merry than wi&s;e, &s;tole it from
him one day in the mid&s;t of his pleading;
but he had better have let it alone, for he
lo&s;t his cau&s;e by his je&s;t<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">SPECTATOR, No. 407.</NOTE>.&endq; The effect
of habit in the&s;e in&s;tances is very &s;trange and
unaccountable. The cu&s;tom has no greater
fitne&s;s for introducing any one &s;et of ideas
than any other; the particular ideas which are
introduced, have no &s;ort of connexion with the
circum&s;tance which cu&s;tom has rendered ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="147" REF="154">
for their introduction, and perhaps
have never formerly been conjoined with it;
it &s;eems to contribute to their introduction
only by preventing an unea&s;ine&s;s which would
indi&s;po&s;e the mind for exerting its faculties.</P>

<P>THE other principle in human nature,
which has an influence on the a&s;&s;oci|ation
of ideas, which either promotes the in|troduction
of &s;uch as are linked together by
&s;ome of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities, or introduces
ideas unconnected with each other, merely by
means of their relation to it&s;elf, is a pre&s;ent
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A PASSION in &s;trict propriety means only
&s;uch an emotion as is produced by &s;ome one
particular cau&s;e, and directed to &s;ome one de|terminate
object. There are &s;everal emotions,
as remor&s;e, &s;elf-approbation, and the like,
which may perhaps be reckoned &s;en&s;ations
rather than pa&s;&s;ions: but our pre&s;ent de&s;ign
does not render it nece&s;&s;ary to attend to that
di&s;tinction. A pa&s;&s;ion is &s;omething different
from an habitual temper or turn of mind: the
<PB N="148" REF="155">
latter may in &s;ome in&s;tances have derived its
origin from the frequent returns or the long
continuance of a particular pa&s;&s;ion; but once
formed, it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts without the operation of
any particular cau&s;e, and without being fixt
on any preci&s;e object, and produces a perma|nent
propen&s;ity to any &s;entiments or pa&s;&s;ions
which are congruous to it. But a pa&s;&s;ion and
an habitual temper have &s;o many things in
common, that we may without any incon|venience
include both in the cau&s;e of a&s;&s;oci|ation
which we are now examining: it will
be &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h them in particular
in&s;tances, when &s;uch &s;hall happen to occur,
in which their influence on the introduction
of ideas is different, or in which they run
counter to one another.</P>
<P>IN general, that the train of ideas &s;ugge&s;ted
to the mind, has a very great dependence on
the pa&s;&s;ions, is obvious. Mention &s;ome actions
of a per&s;on whom we love; our love will &s;ug|ge&s;t
&s;uch circum&s;tances as tend to make us ap|prove
the&s;e actions. Mention the very &s;ame
actions to another who entertains re&s;entment
again&s;t the per&s;on who did them; and his
imagination will immediately clothe them
with &s;uch circum&s;tances as de&s;troy their merit,
or render them blameable. Let us barely
<PB N="149" REF="156">
think of any per&s;on: if we love him, we rea|dily
recollect and dwell upon the fair and
worthy parts of his character; if we hate
him, his wrong or &s;u&s;picious actions croud
into our thoughts. The joyful heart runs
ea&s;ily into a gay and plea&s;ant train of think|ing,
but does not naturally recollect any thing
that is gloomy, and in&s;tantly rejects it if it be
&s;ugge&s;ted by peculiar cau&s;es. The ob&s;erva|tion
holds of every emotion, pa&s;&s;ion, and di&s;|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>IT will be proper, however, to attempt a
fuller explication of the manner in which the
pa&s;&s;ions influence the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas. To
under&s;tand this, is of great importance in a
theory of the varieties of genius; for to give
a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the pa&s;&s;ions, is one of
the greate&s;t efforts of genius; and it can be
accompli&s;hed only by following tho&s;e paths
into which the pa&s;&s;ions naturally direct the
thoughts. But the influence of the pa&s;&s;ions
on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our ideas, though thus
important, relates only to one &s;pecies of ge|nius
for the <HI>arts.</HI> It would therefore
be improper to enter on a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it
at pre&s;ent, when we are tracing out the <HI>gene|ral</HI>
&s;ources of the varieties of genius. In the
ob&s;ervations which we are now to make on
<PB N="150" REF="157">
this &s;ubject, &s;ome examples will be nece&s;&s;ary
both for illu&s;trating and for confirming our
principles. It may perhaps be thought mo&s;t
proper to draw the&s;e from our own experi|ence
in real life. But to be able to &s;elect ex|ample
from real life, and to &s;et them in a
&s;triking light, would require no &s;mall degree
of one of the highe&s;t and rare&s;t kinds of poeti|cal
genius. It will therefore be both the &s;afe&s;t
and the be&s;t way, to take our examples from
&s;uch repre&s;entations of the pa&s;&s;ions in poetry,
as are confe&s;&s;edly natural, and will approve
them&s;elves natural to the ta&s;te of the reader.
Such examples have as great authority as in|&s;tances
which a per&s;on him&s;elf ob&s;erves in or|dinary
life. Shake&s;pear alone will almo&s;t &s;up|ply
us with as many as are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IN taking a general view of the influence
of the pa&s;&s;ions on a&s;&s;ociation, it will be nece&s;|&s;ry,
fir&s;t, to point out the manner in which
they affect the <HI>nature</HI> of the ideas &s;elected and
introduced.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome ideas intimately connected
with a pa&s;&s;ion, as the object of the pa&s;&s;ion, its
cau&s;e, what is &s;it for &s;upporting it, or what
gratifies it. Every pa&s;&s;ion has a &s;trong ten|dency
to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ch ideas, to force them
into our view, to make us prone to conceive
<PB N="151" REF="158">
them. We naturally continue fixt in atten|tion
to &s;uch ideas, or recur often to the con|templation
of them. A pa&s;&s;ion leads us to
them, &s;olely by its own force, without any
a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a pre&s;ent perception connected
with them. When a per&s;on is under the in|fluence
of any pa&s;&s;ion, the difficulty is not to
recollect the objects clo&s;ely connected with it,
but to prevent their haunting him continually.
An angry man, for example, can &s;carce avoid
thinking of the per&s;on who has offended him,
and of the injury which he has done him, re|collecting
every thing he can di&s;honourable
to that per&s;on remembering with plea&s;ure the
misfortunes which have happened to him,
even imagining di&s;tre&s;&s;es into which he may
fall, and in a word dwelling on the concep|tion
of every thing immediately relating to
his anger. Angelo's de&s;cription of his own
di&s;po&s;ition when he was under the power of
love, is perfectly natural;</P>

<P><PB N="152" REF="159">
DIFFERENT ideas are in different ways
clo&s;ely connected with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion; the
pa&s;&s;ion tends to introduce all the&s;e. On this
account it often happens that the mind does
not re&s;t on any one of them, but conceives
them all by turns. Every pa&s;&s;ion often occa|&s;ions
an abruptne&s;s of thought; this is one
cau&s;e of that abruptne&s;s; different ideas being
connected with the pa&s;&s;ion, in different re|&s;pects,
but with almo&s;t equal clo&s;ene&s;s, the
pa&s;&s;ion introduces them all, or &s;everal of them
at lea&s;t, in alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Seba&s;tian over|whelmed
with fear and grief by the pro&s;pect
of immediate &s;hipwreck, exclaims,</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Mercy on us!</L></Q>
<P>We &s;plit, we &s;plit! farewel my wife and children,
Brother farewel! we &s;plit, we &s;plit, we &s;plit!<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Tempe&s;t, act 1. &s;cene 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>His pa&s;&s;ion leads him to think of him&s;elf, its
mo&s;t immediate object; but without &s;uffering
him to re&s;t a moment on this, it hurries him on
to a conception of the cau&s;e of his pa&s;&s;ion, the
&s;plitting of the &s;hip; it allows him to make
but a very &s;hort &s;top here; it cau&s;es his family
and friends, objects which were likewi&s;e nearly
related to his grief, to croud into his view;
and from the&s;e, it forces him back to the
thought of the immediate cau&s;e of his pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="153" REF="160">
and makes his mind to dwell upon it. It
&s;uffers him not to think of any thing that has
not an intimate relation to it&s;elf, and it makes
his imagination to vibrate between tho&s;e
which have &s;uch relation. I&s;abel being in|formed
that her brother had been put to death
by Angelo's command, her re&s;entment imme|diately
&s;ugge&s;e&s;t &s;ome means of revenging
his death; but without &s;uffering her to re&s;t
on the&s;e means, or to take any notice of the
impo&s;&s;ibility of her employing them, even
though it is mentioned to her, re&s;entment
brings into her thoughts in an in&s;tant, her
brother, her&s;elf, the wickedne&s;s of mankind,
and the ba&s;ene&s;s of Angelo, all objects natu|turally
connected with her pa&s;&s;ion:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>I&s;ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I will to him and pluck out his eyes.</P>

</SP>
<P>IF a pa&s;&s;ion can thus introduce ideas &s;uitable
to it, merely by its own force, it will much
more introduce them when there happens to
be a perception pre&s;ent to the mind, to which
they bear any of the a&s;&s;ociating relations.
Either the pa&s;&s;ion alone, or that relation alone
would have been &s;ufficient for the effect:
<PB N="154" REF="161">
when both therefore operate together, they
are like mechanical forces acting in the &s;ame
direction, which produce a double effect, or
produce the &s;ame effect with half the diffi|culty.
When any pa&s;&s;ion prevails in the
&s;oul, ideas &s;trictly connected with that pa&s;|&s;ion
are in a continual readine&s;s to ru&s;h into
the thoughts on every the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion.
Hence it is commonly ob&s;erved that the mo&s;t
di&s;tant hint is &s;ufficient to direct the imagina|tion
to an object which is congruous to the
pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the mind. We have a
very natural and &s;trong repre&s;entation of this
in Lear's grief and indignation on account of
the unkindne&s;s of his daughters. When he
&s;ees Edgar's di&s;mal &s;ituation, he &s;ays,

pa&s;s? Could&s;t thou &s;ave nothing? Did'&s;t thou
give'em all?&endq;</P>
<P>The fool's interruption could not divert the
thought; he goes on,</P>

There are ordinarily many occa&s;ions which
have a powerful tendency to &s;ugge&s;t to a per|&s;on
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a pa&s;&s;ion, objects altogether
unrelated to that pa&s;&s;ion: the mind is always
di&s;po&s;ed to reject the&s;e, and in con&s;equence of
this, it pur&s;ues one of two cour&s;es. Some|times
it takes a handle from the objects that
occur, whatever they be, to recollect &s;ome|thing
&s;uitable to the pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ion, it ima|gines
tho&s;e objects related to this pa&s;&s;ion,
though their analogy to it be very remote,
as in the example ju&s;t now given, nay tho'
they have not even a &s;hadow of connexion
with it. Harpagon going out of his garden
in que&s;t of the officers of ju&s;tice, after he had
mi&s;&s;ed his ca&s;ket of money, and &s;eeing the

people in the &s;treet, is naturally made to
&s;ay;</P>

my thief that's there? For heaven's &s;ake, if
you know tidings of my thief, I be&s;eech you

<P>This happens when the pa&s;&s;ion is violent,
and when the tendency of the pre&s;ent objects
to &s;ugge&s;t ideas un&s;uitable to it, is not very
&s;trong. But when the pa&s;&s;ion is not &s;o vio|lent,
<PB N="157" REF="164">
or when it is an habitual di&s;po&s;ition that
prevails in the &s;oul, and when at the &s;ame
time the pre&s;ent objects have a &s;trong ten|dency
to lead the thoughts to ideas unrelated
to that pa&s;&s;ion or di&s;po&s;ition, the mind takes
a different cour&s;e: it goes backward and for|ward
between the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by the pa&s;|&s;ion,
and the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by the pre&s;ent
objects; there is a con&s;tant &s;truggle between
the&s;e, and a quick and frequent variation of
thought. This is another cau&s;e of abruptne&s;s
and unconnectedne&s;s in the &s;entiments of a
per&s;on under the power of any pa&s;&s;ion; his
mind vibrates between conceptions &s;uitable to
his pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;&s;imilar conceptions ari&s;ing
from different circum&s;tances in his &s;ituation.
Moliere has repre&s;ented this &s;trongly in Har|pagon;
however he is engaged, his avarice
makes the thought of the money which he
had hid in his garden, to intermix it&s;elf with
his pre&s;ent employment.</P>
<P>THOSE objects which are clo&s;ely connected
with any pa&s;&s;ion, are likewi&s;e connected by
&s;ome of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities with other
objects, which therefore they have a natural
tendency to &s;ugge&s;t. Now as it appears from
what has been &s;aid, that every pa&s;&s;ion exerts
it&s;elf in confining our thoughts to the objects
<PB N="158" REF="165">
immediately connected with it, it would &s;eem
to follow, that a pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t hinder the&s;e
from &s;ugge&s;ting any other objects, however
nearly related to them&s;elves, and thus to put
a &s;top to all &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ideas. It has plainly
a tendency to this; and the tendency takes
effect in &s;ome degree. A pa&s;&s;ion never fails
to confine our attention very much to the ideas
which are mo&s;t immediately related to it&s;elf.
But &s;uch is the con&s;titution of the human
mind, that it cannot confine its attention
altogether to one unvaried object for any con|&s;iderable
time. The pa&s;&s;ions being oppo&s;ed
by this law of our con&s;titution, cannot keep
the mind long fixt on one view of the object
which it has fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted. Yet it endea|vours
to do &s;o; and the fir&s;t effect of the en|deavour
is, that the mind aver&s;e from quitting
that object, turns it to every &s;ide, and views
it in various lights. In the following exam|ple,
this effect appears very &s;trikingly with
re&s;pect to the pa&s;&s;ion of love:</P>

</SP>
<P>We have already di&s;covered two &s;ources of the
abruptne&s;s of thought occa&s;ioned by pa&s;&s;ion;
and we may now perceive another &s;ource of
it. Different views of the &s;ame object are
very unlike; a pa&s;&s;ion brings the&s;e different
views before the mind, in a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
and in an irregular groupe.</P>
<P>IN this way the pa&s;&s;ion prevents a change
of object for &s;ome time. But the different
views of the &s;ame object are not inexhau&s;tible.
The pa&s;&s;ion therefore yielding to the impul&s;e
of our con&s;titution, allows the pre&s;ent object
<PB N="160" REF="167">
to &s;ugge&s;t ideas related to it. Hence it ari&s;es
that, under the influence of any pa&s;&s;ion, we
conceive not only the objects which are inti|mately
related to it, but al&s;o &s;uch others as
are &s;trongly connected with the&s;e by any of
the a&s;&s;ociating qualities. The former objects
would &s;ugge&s;t the&s;e latter, if we were not
under the influence of any pa&s;&s;ion, the&s;e
therefore will occur more readily than any
others, when, notwith&s;tanding the influence of
the pa&s;&s;ion, we mu&s;t have &s;ome ideas on
which to employ our thoughts. Be&s;ides, an
idea connected with objects clo&s;ely related to a
pa&s;&s;ion, may by its pre&s;ence gratify the pa&s;&s;|ion,
or &s;upport it, or fall in with it in other
ways; and in this ca&s;e &s;uch an idea is often
&s;ugge&s;ted even when the mind is under no
nece&s;&s;ity of being relieved from a conception
which has long occupied it. The Counte&s;s of
Rou&s;illon parting with her &s;on Bertram, who
is going to the army, the grief which this
produces, &s;ugge&s;ts to them both, an event
related by re&s;emblance, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure
al&s;o by cau&s;ation, to the occa&s;ion of that grief;
the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band and his father:</P>

<P>And in going, Madam, I weep o'er

</SP>
<P>The mother does not &s;ay, the delivering up
of my &s;on reminds me of my burying my
hu&s;band; &s;he expre&s;&s;es it much more &s;trong|ly;
the &s;on &s;peaks in a manner equally for|cible,
the imagination of both converts the
pre&s;ent event into the &s;imilar event &s;ugge&s;ted
by it. This figure is felt by every per&s;on to
be perfectly natural and proper; and its be|ing
&s;o, &s;hows that, when an object &s;trictly
connected with a pa&s;&s;ion introduces another
object a&s;&s;ociated with it&s;elf, the pa&s;&s;ion im|pells
the mind to conceive this other object
very &s;trongly, and to be&s;tow upon it as inti|mate
a relation to the pa&s;&s;ion, as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT though a pa&s;&s;ion does not hinder an
object from &s;ugge&s;ting others, it has a great
influence on the nature of the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted.
An object which has been brought into view
immediately by a pa&s;&s;ion, may be related, by
one or other of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities, to a
great multitude of ideas of very different
kinds: but it will not in this ca&s;e introduce
any of the&s;e indi&s;eriminately; the pa&s;&s;ion,
which brought it&s;elf into view, will direct it
to introduce &s;uch of the&s;e only as are &s;uitable
<PB N="162" REF="169">
to that pa&s;&s;ion. The perception pre&s;ent to
the mind, con&s;idered &s;imply in it&s;elf, has an
equal fitne&s;s to bring into view any one of a
hundred ideas; but it&s;elf was introduced by
a pa&s;&s;ion which &s;till continues to exert its
power, and indi&s;po&s;es the mind for thinking
on any thing un&s;uitable to it, and which thus
diverts the a&s;&s;ociating force of the pre&s;ent
perception from the direction it might have
otherwi&s;e taken, and leads the imagination to
&s;elect and take notice of only &s;uch ideas as
are &s;uitable to the pa&s;&s;ion, as well as to the
pre&s;ent perception, overlooking many others
which are equally connected with the latter.
The a&s;&s;ociating forces of the&s;e two, have
&s;ome &s;imilitude to compound powers in me|chanics,
which by their joint action produce
motion in a direction different from that in
which either acts, and lying between the &s;e|parate
directions of the two. Or, to &s;et the
matter in a different light, tho&s;e ideas which
are not only a&s;&s;ociated with the pre&s;ent per|ception,
but al&s;o &s;uitable to the pa&s;&s;ion that
introduced it, are dragged into the mind by
a double force; whereas the pre&s;ent percep|tion
alone tends to draw in other ideas a&s;&s;o|ciated
with it, and the pa&s;&s;ion oppo&s;es their
entrance, often with &s;uperior &s;trength. The
<PB N="163" REF="170">
latter cannot therefore fail to be neglected; the
former mu&s;t be introduced in preference to them.
Thus, though a pa&s;&s;ion allows an object imme|diately
connected with it, to introduce ideas, yet
it always moulds tho&s;e which are introduced,
into its own likene&s;s, or into a form agreeable
to it&s;elf, and it &s;uffers none to enter which
are not &s;u&s;ceptible of this form. When Alon|zo's
companions are endeavouring to alleviate
his grief for the &s;uppo&s;ed lo&s;s of his &s;on, by
diverting his thoughts to his daughter's mar|riage
with the King of Tunis, in their return
from which they now &s;uffered &s;hipwreck, he
an&s;wers them,
<Q><L>You cram the&s;e words into mine ears again&s;t</L>
<L>The &s;tomach of my &s;en&s;e. Would I had never</L>
<L>Married my daughter there! for coming thence</L>
<L>My &s;on is lo&s;t, and, in my rate, &s;he too,</L>
<L>Who is &s;o far from Italy remov'd,</L>
<L>I ne'er again &s;hall &s;ee her: O thou mine heir</L>
<L>Of Naples and of Milan, what &s;trange fi&s;h</L>
<L>Hath made his meal on thee?<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> act 2. &s;cene 1.</NOTE></L></Q>
This example illu&s;trates and confirms almo&s;t
every ob&s;ervation we have had occa&s;ion to
make concerning the influence of the pa&s;&s;ions
upon a&s;&s;ociation. His grief keeps his atten|tion
fixt on the lo&s;s of his &s;on, an object im|mediately
<PB N="164" REF="171">
connected with it as being its cau&s;e,
and that in &s;pight of every thought by which
his companions endeavoured to divert it.
This object &s;ugge&s;ts an idea related to it by
cau&s;ation, his daughter's marriage at Tunis,
the event which occa&s;ioned that lo&s;s. This
event carries his thoughts back again to the
death of his &s;on; which, when thus again
pre&s;ented to his imagination, &s;ugge&s;ts a &s;e|cond
time his daughter's marriage, by means
of its re&s;emblance to it in one particular, that
her di&s;tance deprived him of all intercour&s;e
with her, as much as if &s;he too had been
dead. But &s;orrow for his &s;on allows him not
to re&s;t long upon this thought, &s;uitable as it
is to his pa&s;&s;ion, or to pur&s;ue any others
which this might have introduced; it makes
his imagination in&s;tantly to recur to the lo&s;s
of his &s;on, to view it in every light, to con|ceive
many circum&s;tances relating to him,
his being his heir, his being entitled to large
dominions, his being devoured by fi&s;hes.
This example is thus a new illu&s;tration of the
principles formerly explained, That a pa&s;&s;ion
tends to fix the view on objects intimately
connected with it, or to make it often recur
to them, not only on the &s;lighte&s;t hint, but
even without any occa&s;ion, and that the&s;e
<PB N="165" REF="172">
objects &s;ugge&s;t ideas related to them. It is
likewi&s;e a direct illu&s;tration of the principle
now under con&s;ideration, and for the &s;ake of
which we have cited it. It is a &s;triking in|&s;tance
of the power of a pa&s;&s;ion to enable a
perception connected with it, to introduce not
indi&s;criminately any ideas related to it&s;elf,
but only &s;uch as are at the &s;ame time &s;uitable
to the nature of the pa&s;&s;ion. No ideas are
conceived, but &s;uch as are perfectly &s;uitable
to Alonzo's &s;orrow. Claribel's marriage was
in it&s;elf fully as fit for &s;ugge&s;ting ideas of the
mirth or pomp which attended it, or of the
circum&s;tances which rendered it de&s;irable,
and moved Alonzo to urge it, as for &s;ugge&s;ting
ideas of its di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances and
con&s;equences. It had actually &s;ugge&s;ted ideas
of the former kind to the re&s;t of the compa|ny;
but Alonzo's &s;orrow hinders them from
occurring to him, and forces into his view
&s;uch thoughts as are unplea&s;ant, and excite
regret.</P>
<P>FURTHER, a pa&s;&s;ion has an influence on
the <HI>number,</HI> as well as on the nature of the
ideas introduced. It tends &s;o &s;trongly to keep
the attention fixt on the objects &s;trictly con|nected
with it, that it &s;uffers not the&s;e to &s;ug|ge&s;t
a long train of ideas, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively related
<PB N="166" REF="173">
to each other. It generally allows us to go
only one &s;tep or two beyond them; after we
have been led by means of them to conceive
one idea, we go not forward to the view of
others a&s;&s;ociated with that; &s;till the pa&s;&s;ion
makes the object nearly allied to it, to dwell
upon the thought; we recur to the contem|plation
of this object, and it &s;ugge&s;ts a new
idea, related to it&s;elf but not to that idea
which it had introduced formerly. In other
ca&s;es, after the imagination has once received
an impul&s;e, it readily goes on from one per|ception
through a number of others, till it
arrive at a great di&s;tance from that with which
it began: and it would be difficult to &s;top its
career, to bring it back to the object from
which it &s;et out, or to make it enter into a
different track. But when the mind is occu|pied
by a pa&s;&s;ion, the difficulty lies wholly
on the other &s;ide; the pa&s;&s;ion directs the view
to things clo&s;ely connected with it, &s;o power|fully
and &s;o con&s;tantly, that the imagination
is drawn backward to repeated conceptions of
them: when our natural propen&s;ity to vary
the object of our thought, indi&s;po&s;es us for
dwelling longer on them alone, they yet re|tain
their hold of us &s;o far that we enter ea|&s;ily
into another track pointed out by them:
<PB N="167" REF="174">
we cannot without a painful effort, often
we cannot at all, proceed &s;o long in one path
as to leave them far behind us; all the ideas
introduced after a few removes, are but
&s;lightly connected with the object which the
pa&s;&s;ion di&s;po&s;es us to re&s;t upon, and that pa&s;&s;ion
checks all propen&s;ity to go through or attend
to many ideas but &s;lightly connected. The
imagination re&s;embles a per&s;on attached to
home, who cannot without reluctance under|take
a long journey, but can with plea&s;ure
make &s;hort excur&s;ions, returning home from
each, and thence &s;etting out anew. Oppo&s;ite
forces in mechanics tend to de&s;troy one ano|ther.
This is analogous to the ca&s;e before us.
The objects &s;trictly connected with a pa&s;&s;ion
are naturally fit for introducing ideas related
to them&s;elves; the pa&s;&s;ion acts in a contrary
direction, and endeavours to keep the mind
from running off to the&s;e: there is a perpe|tual
&s;truggle between the two. The pa&s;&s;ion
having kept the attention fixt for &s;ome time
on an object intimately connected with it, its
force begins to flag: that object is conceived
in a lively and vigorous manner, by rea&s;on of
its relation to the pa&s;&s;ion, and therefore very
powerfully draws in ideas a&s;&s;ociated with it.
But the conception of all the &s;ucceeding ob|jects
<PB N="168" REF="175">
drawn in by it, is &s;till weaker and
weaker; on this account their power of intro|ducing
ideas becomes continually le&s;s and
le&s;s; &s;o that after a few &s;teps they give us a
very incon&s;iderable propen&s;ity to go forward.
The pa&s;&s;ion exerts a force &s;uperior to their's;
it therefore prevails, it prevents farther a&s;&s;o|ciation,
it brings back the attention to &s;ome
object clo&s;ely connected with it, it invigorates
the conception of that object &s;o as to enable it
to &s;ugge&s;t a new idea; but it hinders us from
going to a greater di&s;tance than before. Here
we di&s;cover a new cau&s;e of that abruptne&s;s of
thought which a pa&s;&s;ion occa&s;ions. It ari&s;es
partly, we have &s;een, from the mind's divid|ing
its attention between &s;everal objects all
clo&s;ely and almo&s;t equally connected with the
pa&s;&s;ion; partly from the rapidity with which
the mind takes in di&s;&s;imilar views of any one
of the&s;e objects; and partly from the &s;truggle
between objects &s;ugge&s;ted by the pa&s;&s;ion, and
objects &s;ugge&s;ted by other means: but it al&s;o
ari&s;es partly from the con&s;tant vibration of the
thought between the objects immediately con|nected
with the pa&s;&s;ion, and the ideas which
they tend to introduce. The mind leaves
any of the&s;e ideas as &s;oon as it has conceived
it, it lays hold of an object more clo&s;ely con|nected
<PB N="169" REF="176">
with the pa&s;&s;ion, it runs from it to an
idea &s;ugge&s;ted by it, but wholly unrelated to
the former. This alone mu&s;t produce a great
want of connexion, and many breaks, in the
expre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiments re&s;ulting from a pa&s;|&s;ion.
The&s;e principles now laid down, are
&s;ufficiently illu&s;trated by the la&s;t example
which we cited. Alonzo's grief made the lo&s;s
of his &s;on to &s;ugge&s;t the di&s;tance of his daugh|ter,
and the con&s;equence of that di&s;tance, the
improbability of his ever &s;eeing her; but
without allowing him to pur&s;ue that thought,
hurries him back to the lo&s;s of his &s;on, and &s;ets
him a thinking on new circum&s;tances con|nected
with it. The marriage of his daugh|ter,
the lo&s;s of his &s;on, the lo&s;s of his daughter,
her di&s;tance, the little chance for his &s;eeing
her again, the lo&s;s of his &s;on, his being heir
to exten&s;ive territories, his being devoured by
fi&s;hes, all &s;ucceed one another in his thoughts,
with great abruptne&s;s and rapidity.</P>
<P>THERE is a fault very common in drama|tic
poetry: per&s;ons are made to expre&s;s their
pa&s;&s;ions, not as if they were really actuated
by them, but as if they were &s;pectators of
them in others; the poet gives not a natural
<HI>repre&s;entation</HI> of the pa&s;&s;ion, but a laboured
<HI>de&s;cription</HI> of it. The ob&s;ervations ju&s;t now
<PB N="170" REF="177">
made, lead us to a di&s;covery of the &s;ource of
this fault. An object which is in a particular
in&s;tance &s;trictly connected with a pa&s;&s;ion, and
forced into the mind by it, may be con&s;idered
not only in this particular point of view, but
al&s;o &s;imply in it&s;elf, as a pre&s;ent perception.
Its influence on a&s;&s;ociation is very different,
according as it &s;tands in one of the&s;e &s;ituations
or the other. When it is in the mind &s;imply
as a pre&s;ent perception, it tends to &s;ugge&s;t
any ideas whatever that are connected with it
by any of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities, and to
cau&s;e the mind run from one of the&s;e through
a long train of ideas &s;ucce&s;&s;ively introducing
one another. But when it is brought into the
mind by a pa&s;&s;ion to which it is intimately
related, it receives a tincture from that pa&s;|&s;ion,
it is wholly under the direction of that
pa&s;&s;ion, it exerts its power of a&s;&s;ociation only
in &s;uch ways and &s;o far as the pa&s;&s;ion permits,
it introduces &s;uch ideas alone as are &s;uitable
to the pa&s;&s;ion, and it introduces no long
trains of ideas, but &s;uffers the mind to return
quickly to the conception of it&s;elf, or of &s;ome
other object as intimately related to the pa&s;&s;ion.
For example, a per&s;on may think of the di&s;|tre&s;s
of another without feeling pity: in this
ca&s;e, the thought of that di&s;tre&s;s may lead
<PB N="171" REF="178">
him to conceive any of the actions of the per|&s;on
who &s;uffers it, any other per&s;ons who have
had a concern in the&s;e actions or a connexion
with the actor, any particulars of the conduct
or fortunes of the&s;e per&s;ons; and may thus
open a boundle&s;s field of thought. But when
the di&s;tre&s;s excites pity, this pa&s;&s;ion extin|gui&s;hes
all propen&s;ity to &s;uch excur&s;ions, it
fixes our view on the di&s;tre&s;s by which it is
produced. This di&s;tre&s;s may &s;ugge&s;t, by
means of re&s;emblance, other in&s;tances of di&s;|tre&s;s
in other per&s;ons; it may &s;ugge&s;t, by
means of contrariety, &s;uch circum&s;tances of
former pro&s;perity, as aggravate the pre&s;ent
di&s;tre&s;s; it may lead us to think of the cau&s;e
of it, or to trace out its con&s;equences; in a
word, it may introduce any ideas &s;trictly con|nected
with it, and congruous to the pa&s;&s;ion
of pity: but it has no tendency to &s;ugge&s;t any
others, or to lead the imagination into a re|mote
or exten&s;ive wandering. Did it attempt
this, and did the mind follow it without re|&s;erve,
it mu&s;t quickly come to &s;ome ideas re|pugnant
to the pa&s;&s;ion, and fit for producing
an oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;ition: but this cannot na|turally
or ea&s;ily happen to a per&s;on under the
power of any pa&s;&s;ion. A pa&s;&s;ion leaves no
inclination for going through a long train of
<PB N="172" REF="179">
ideas, and if the mind &s;hould run off to any
di&s;tance or to un&s;uitable ideas, the pa&s;&s;ion
would immediately check it, and recall the
attention to ideas congruous to it&s;elf, as well
as related to the object immediately &s;ugge&s;ted
by it. Now an indifferent poet having con|ceived
&s;ome of the objects &s;trictly connected
with a pa&s;&s;ion, con&s;iders that object only in
general, and ab&s;tractly as a pre&s;ent percep|tion;
he therefore allows him&s;elf to run into
&s;uch a train of thought, as that object pre&s;ent
to the mind would dictate, if it were uncon|nected
with any pa&s;&s;ion; he goes on coolly
imagining &s;uch ideas as it &s;ugge&s;ts by means
of any of the principles of a&s;&s;ociation; and he
makes the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the pa&s;&s;ion, to
expre&s;s all the&s;e ideas. He feels not the pa&s;|&s;ion,
he has not force of genius or &s;en&s;ibility
of heart &s;ufficient for conceiving how it would
affect a per&s;on who felt it, or for entering
into the &s;entiments which it would produce
in him. The &s;entiments which he makes him
utter, might all be very proper in a de&s;crip|tion,
a di&s;cour&s;e, or a meditation, occa&s;ioned
by the view of &s;uch an object; but they are
not natural to a per&s;on in whom that object
produces a &s;uitable pa&s;&s;ion. In order to con|ceive
&s;entiments natural to him, the poet ought
<PB N="173" REF="180">
to have con&s;ined him&s;elf to the con&s;ideration
of the object in this one point of view, as
&s;trictly connected with a pa&s;&s;ion and &s;ugge&s;ted
by it; he ought to indulge only &s;uch a train
of thought, as it would lead to in the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances,
or &s;uch a train as the pa&s;&s;ion with
which it is pre&s;ently connected, would intro|duce
into the mind of a per&s;on under the
power of that pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This is indeed &s;o difficult, that the be&s;t poets
cannot always perfectly attain it. Shake&s;pear
makes the dutche&s;s of Glouce&s;ter, in parting
with John of Gaunt, to expre&s;s her grief in
this manner:
<Q><L>Yet one word more; grief boundeth where it falls,</L>
<L>Not with the empty hollowne&s;s, but weight:</L>
<L>I take my leave before I have begun;</L>
<L>For &s;orrow ends not when it &s;eemeth done.</L>
<L>Commend me to my brother, Edmund York;</L>
<L>Lo, this is all&mdash;nay yet depart not &s;o;</L>
<L>Though this be all, do not &s;o quickly go:</L>
<L>I &s;hall remember more. Bid him&mdash;oh what?</L>
<L>With all good &s;peed at Pla&s;hie vi&s;it me.</L>
<L>Alack, and what &s;hall good old York &s;ee there,</L>
<L>But empty lodgings, and unfurni&s;h'd walls,</L>
<L>Unpeopled offices, untrodden &s;tones?</L>
<L>And what hear there for welcome, but my groans?</L>
<L>Therefore commend me,&mdash;let him not come there</L>
<L>To &s;eek out &s;orrow that dwells every where;</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="181">
All de&s;olate will I from hence, and die;</L>
<L>The la&s;t leave of thee takes my weeping eye.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Richard</HI> II. act 1. &s;cene 3.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>The latter part of the &s;peech is a natural ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of grief, and of violent grief; the
fir&s;t four lines are a de&s;cription, not an ex&s;|pre&s;&s;ion
of it, and therefore un&s;uitable to the
dutche&s;s's &s;tate of mind; the reflection which
they contain is ju&s;t, but too cool for the tem|per
of the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>IT follows from the ob&s;ervations which have
been made, that a pa&s;&s;ion tends to hinder the
mind from running into the conception of
&s;uch ideas as have no connexion with that
pa&s;&s;ion. Since a pa&s;&s;ion fixes the view on ob|jects
immediately connected with it, &s;ince it
continually draws the mind back to the con|ception
of the&s;e objects even from ideas &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by them&s;elves, &s;ince it prevents their
introducing many ideas naturally connected
with them, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence is, that
it will much more exclude ideas which have
no relation either to the&s;e objects or to the
pa&s;&s;ion, and will render a very &s;trong effort
requi&s;ite for bringing them into view. A di|rect
proof of this ari&s;es from the difficulty
which we experience in diverting any pa&s;&s;ion
which has taken firm po&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul, by
<PB N="175" REF="182">
application to &s;uch &s;ubjects as have a tendency
to bani&s;h it: the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;olution and the in|ten&s;e&s;t
endeavours are often insufficient for
bringing the mind to fix on the&s;e &s;ubjects.
Nay, &s;o great is the force of the pa&s;&s;ion, that
when other &s;ubjects are mo&s;t powerfully urged
upon us, when we have the &s;tronge&s;t calls to
give application to them, yet we cannot enter
into them with &s;pirit; the pa&s;&s;ion mixes with
all our thoughts, and continually di&s;turbs the
cour&s;e of them.</P>
<P>IT often happens that two different pa&s;&s;ions,
or that a pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ion and an habitual di&s;|po&s;ition,
occupy the mind together. Each of
the&s;e having a tendency to fix the mind on
objects &s;trictly connected with it&s;elf, or to di|rect
it to &s;uch ideas as the&s;e objects &s;ugge&s;t,
the mind turns quickly from thoughts intro|duced
by the one pa&s;&s;ion, to tho&s;e which are
introduced by the other, and runs con&s;tantly
backward and forward between them, with|out
re&s;ting a moment on either. In this ca&s;e,
the thoughts mu&s;t have an uncommon degree
of abruptne&s;s: each of the pa&s;&s;ions &s;ingly
would have occa&s;ioned abruptne&s;s in the ways
already taken notice of; but to this is &s;uper|added
the unconnectedne&s;s which ari&s;es from
the view being &s;ucce&s;&s;ively directed to objects
<PB N="176" REF="183">
a&s;&s;ociated with different pa&s;&s;ions. Shake&s;pear
affords us a &s;triking in&s;tance of this, when he
repre&s;ents Shylock agitated by avarice, by
grief for the lo&s;s of his daughter, and by rage
at her having married a Chri&s;tian and &s;tolen
his money, and in con&s;equence of that agita|tion
exclaiming,
<Q><L>My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter!</L>
<L>Fled with a Chri&s;tian? O my chri&s;tian ducats!</L>
<L>Ju&s;tice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter!</L>
<L>A &s;ealed bag, two &s;ealed bags of ducats,</L>
<L>Of double ducats, &s;tol'n from me by my daughter!</L>
<L>And jewels, two &s;tones, rich and precious &s;tones,</L>
<L>Stol'n by my daughter! ju&s;tice! find the girl;</L>
<L>She hath the &s;tones upon her, and the ducats!<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Merchant of Venice, <HI>act</HI> 2. <HI>&s;cene</HI> 9.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>IT was evinced, that <HI>habit</HI> not only pro|motes
the introduction of &s;uch ideas as it has
rendered familiar, but al&s;o gives the mind, in
&s;ome ca&s;es, a propen&s;ity to a&s;&s;ociate ideas by
one relation rather than by others. It does
not appear that <HI>the pa&s;&s;ions</HI> give an ab&s;olute
preference to any one relation. An object
immediately connected with a pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ugge&s;ts
indi&s;criminately ideas connected with it&s;elf by
any of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities. Some of
the&s;e qualities may, however, be con&s;idered as
in &s;ome &s;en&s;e more &s;uitable to the pa&s;&s;ions than
<PB N="177" REF="184">
others; and that in two re&s;pects: a pa&s;&s;ion
introduces ideas connected with its immediate
objects by &s;ome of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities,
more commonly and frequently than &s;uch as
are connected with them by other a&s;&s;ociating
qualities: and &s;ome of the a&s;&s;ociating quali|ties
lead the mind to a greater di&s;tance from
the objects &s;trictly connected with the pa&s;&s;ion,
than others of them. Ideas introduced by
&s;ome a&s;&s;ociating qualities, have a le&s;s perfect
relation to the pa&s;&s;ion, than ideas introduced
by others: the former ideas are rarely &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by a pa&s;&s;ion, the latter often: the qua|lities
which give ideas introduced by them but
an imperfect relation, &s;carce ever lead the
mind more than one &s;tep beyond the objects
&s;trctly connected with the pa&s;&s;ion; the others
may lead it &s;everal &s;teps, introducing a &s;eries
of ideas &s;ucce&s;&s;ively a&s;&s;ociated with one ano|ther.</P>
<P>RESEMBLANCE is a quality of the former
kind: there are many ways in which ideas
may re&s;emble an object intimately connected
with a pa&s;&s;ion, that will not lead that object
to &s;ugge&s;t the&s;e ideas. The re&s;emblance mu&s;t
be of a peculiar kind, mu&s;t be &s;uch as fits an
idea to affect the pa&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame way
with the object which &s;ugge&s;ts it, el&s;e the pa&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="178" REF="185">
will check its operation. When the re|&s;emblance
is thus peculiar, the a&s;&s;ociation is
indeed very &s;trong; there are few ideas which
occur more readily either to a per&s;on &s;uffering
any di&s;tre&s;s, or to a&s;pectator moved with pity
for his &s;uffering, than the idea of a &s;imilar
di&s;tre&s;s. But other &s;orts of re&s;emblance have
no &s;uch effect: hence it is univer&s;ally allowed,
that &s;imilitudes are in general un&s;uitable to
the language of pa&s;&s;ion, and that even me|taphors
ought to be admitted into it with
great re&s;erve. In this re&s;pect, what Shake&s;|pear
puts into the mouth of the queen, when
&s;he &s;ees her hu&s;band king Richard a pri&s;oner,
is faulty and unnatural;
<Q><L>But &s;oft, but &s;ee, or rather do not &s;ee,</L>
<L>My fair ro&s;e wither; yet look up; behold,</L>
<L>That you in pity may di&s;&s;olve to dew,</L>
<L>And wa&s;h him fre&s;h again with true-love tears.</L>
<L>O thou the model where old Troy did &s;tand,</L>
<L>Thou map of honour, thou king Richard's tomb,</L>
<L>And not king Richard; thou mo&s;t beauteous inn,</L>

Be&s;ides, re&s;emblance leads the mind only one
&s;tep; an idea &s;ugge&s;ted by means of its re|&s;emblance
to any of the objects &s;trictly con|nected
<PB N="179" REF="186">
with a pa&s;&s;ion, &s;eldom sugge&s;ts another
idea re&s;embling it&s;elf. A pa&s;&s;ion occupies the
mind too much, to leave it lei&s;ure or inclina|tion
for hunting after &s;imilitudes. One re|&s;embling
idea is often &s;uitable to the pa&s;&s;ion,
and fit to influence it; but by conceiving ano|ther
idea re&s;embling that, much more by go|ing
through &s;everal ideas, each of which is
&s;ugge&s;ted by its re&s;emblance to the preceding,
we mu&s;t come to &s;uch as are no ways related
to the pa&s;&s;ion, as are wholly unfit for influ|encing
it, and as bear no likene&s;s to any of
the objects clo&s;ely connected with it. But the
nature of pa&s;&s;ion permits us not to indulge
our&s;elves in the conception of &s;uch ideas.
Richard giving vent to his grief in pri&s;on,
might naturally &s;ay, on hearing time broke
in mu&s;ic,
<Q><L>And here have I the daintine&s;s of ear,</L>
<L>To check time broke in a di&s;order'd &s;tring;</L>

<L>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke:</L>
<L>I wa&s;ted time, and now doth time wa&s;te me.</L></Q>
But he could &s;carce naturally add,
<Q><L>For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:</L>
<L>My thoughts are minutes; and with &s;ighs they jar</L>

<P>Contrariety &s;eldom leads the mind more than
one &s;tep from the object immediately &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by the pa&s;&s;ion: a &s;hort contra&s;t may
very much enliven our conception of that ob|ject;
it thus naturally falls in with the pa&s;&s;ion:
but a &s;eries of contra&s;ts would produce a very
different effect; a multitude of antithe&s;es in
writing of any &s;ort, &s;how an imagination di&s;|po&s;ed
to &s;eek amu&s;ement, not a mind inten&s;ely
engaged by its &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="188">
OBJECTS &s;trictly connected with a pa&s;&s;ion,
often &s;ugge&s;t likewi&s;e the ideas of other ob|jects
a&s;&s;ociated with them by <HI>vicinity.</HI> In|deed
contiguous objects are frequently con|nected
together by other relations, and in that
ca&s;e a pa&s;&s;ion leads us &s;trongly to conceive
them. But vicinity alone is &s;ufficient for
producing this effect: a view of the contigu|ous
objects renders our conception of a thing
determinate and lively, and thus when that
thing is intimately related to a pa&s;&s;ion, tends
to invigorate and &s;upport the pa&s;&s;ion. A pa&s;|&s;ion
makes us prone to this, and naturally
a&s;&s;i&s;ts vicinity in introducing &s;uch ideas as
can promote it. But vicinity never intro|duces
a long train of ideas: it would be un|natural
for a per&s;on actuated by any pa&s;&s;ion,
to run along a multitude of objects contigu|ous
to one another either in place or in time,
for this would tend to divert the pa&s;&s;ion by
variety.</P>
<P>CO-EXISTENCE and the relation of <HI>cau&s;e
and effect,</HI> are the principles of a&s;&s;ociation
which the pa&s;&s;ions employ mo&s;t frequently,
and which &s;ugge&s;t the longe&s;t trains of ideas.
The&s;e give ideas the mo&s;t perfect relation to
a pa&s;&s;ion; and almo&s;t every idea introduced
by means of the&s;e principles, really influences
<PB N="182" REF="189">
the pa&s;&s;ion. Co-exi&s;tence &s;ugge&s;ts the quali|ties,
the circum&s;tances, the acoe&s;&s;ories, and
the concomitants of tho&s;e objects which are
clo&s;ely connected with the pa&s;&s;ion; and the
more of the&s;e we have in our view, the &s;tronger
and livelier is our conception of tho&s;e objects.
All the objects almo&s;t which the relation of
cau&s;e and effect can &s;ugge&s;t, contribute either
more immediately or more remotely to the
production of the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf; and therefore
are &s;trongly connected with it. Accordingly,
in mo&s;t of the examples which have been
produced, the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by objects &s;trictly
connected with the pa&s;&s;ions, are &s;uch as are
&s;ugge&s;ted by means of the&s;e two principles of
a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>IT is a natural inference from the ob&s;er|vations
which have been already made, that
the pa&s;&s;ions, far from di&s;po&s;ing us to follow
order in the train of our ideas, render us in|capable
of pre&s;erving order. The inference
is &s;o obvious, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pend
time in confirming it. Abruptne&s;s, incohe|rence,
fluctuation of thought, are the con&s;e|quences
of pa&s;&s;ion; and the&s;e are the re|ver&s;e
of order. But it is worth while to ob|&s;erve,
that a pa&s;&s;ion even inverts the natural
order of our ideas. As the imagination pa&s;&s;es
<PB N="183" REF="190">
from one idea to another connected with it,
&s;o a pa&s;&s;ion once excited does not confine
it&s;elf to its fir&s;t object, but readily extends it|&s;elf
to other objects connected with that; love
or hatred to any per&s;on, &s;eldom fails to pro|duce
&s;ome degree of love or hatred to &s;uch as
are connected with him. It has been &s;hown
by philo&s;ophers, that the imagination pa&s;&s;es
mo&s;t readily from a le&s;s con&s;iderable to a more
con&s;iderable object; but that a pa&s;&s;ion, on the
contrary, pa&s;&s;es with greate&s;t ea&s;e from the
more to the le&s;s con&s;iderable object<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e of Human Nature, Vol. II. Part ii. Sect. 2.</NOTE>: and
what we would now ob&s;erve is, that a pa&s;&s;ion
prevailing in the mind, cau&s;es the imagina|tion
to proceed in this latter direction. In|deed
if it did not, the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf could not
be extended to the inferior and &s;ubordinate
objects; for it cannot be directed to them till
we have formed ideas of them. When the
mind is cool, and not under the influence of
any pa&s;&s;ion, the idea of a &s;on or of a &s;ervant
&s;ugge&s;ts the idea of the father or the ma&s;ter,
more naturally and more certainly than the
idea of the father or the ma&s;ter would &s;ug|ge&s;t
that of the &s;on or the &s;ervant. On the
contrary, love, hatred, re&s;entment, towards a
father or a ma&s;ter, very readily extend them|&s;elves
<PB N="184" REF="191">
to the &s;on or the &s;ervant, though we
might feel the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions towards the&s;e
latter, without conceiving any degree of them
towards the former. At the &s;ame time the
pa&s;&s;ion towards the &s;uperior, gives the imagi|nation
an irre&s;i&s;tible propen&s;ity to run into
the conception of the inferior or dependent:
eager to extend it&s;elf, it forces upon us the
idea without which it could not be extended.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Reflections on the Principles of A&s;&s;ociation.
Ideas &s;ugge&s;ted either by Sen&s;ations, or by
other Ideas.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the account which has been al|ready
given of the principles of a&s;&s;oci|ation
it is ea&s;y to collect, That there is a
broad foundation laid in the nature of the
human imagination, for great extent and va|ricty
of genius. There are many relations of
ideas, which fit them for being a&s;&s;ociated;
almo&s;t every perception bears &s;ome of the&s;e
relations to many different ideas; habit and
the pa&s;&s;ions multiply and vary the in&s;tru|ments
of a&s;&s;ociation: by the&s;e means there
are innumerable handles by which the imagi|nation
<PB N="185" REF="192">
may &s;eize &s;uch ideas as it has occa&s;ion
for. Genius has, in &s;ome men, great force
and compa&s;s: but a vigorous con&s;truction of
the a&s;&s;ociating principles is &s;ufficient to account
for it, however great it be; for if they be vi|gorous,
any one perception may introduce a
great multitude of others, and that by means
of many different relations. The principles
of a&s;&s;ociation likewi&s;e being &s;o various, can|not
but admit many di&s;tinct combinations and
modifications, by which genius will be mould|ed
into a great diver&s;ity of forms. In order
therefore to prepare the way for a di&s;covery
of the varieties of genius, it will be proper to
make &s;ome reflections on the principles of
a&s;&s;ociation, which have been &s;eparately illu&s;|trated</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent perception which introduces
others, by means of the relations that they
bear to it, may be either a &s;en&s;ation of an
object, or only an idea of it. In whichever
of the&s;e ways the object be perceived, it has
the very &s;ame relations to others; and there|fore
in both ca&s;es it has a tendency to &s;ugge&s;t
the very &s;ame ideas. But it will not always
&s;ugge&s;t them with the &s;ame force or certainty
in the&s;e two ca&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="193">
THAT a perception may introduce others,
it is nece&s;&s;ary that it&s;elf take &s;ome hold of the
mind, and be attended to; and the &s;tronger a
perception is, it takes the firmer hold of the
mind, and excites the clo&s;er attention. The
actual &s;en&s;ation of an object is always much
&s;tronger than any conception of it, which
memory or imagination can exhibit. On this
account, a &s;en&s;ation of an object will often
introduce ideas which the mere conception of
that object would not have force to &s;ugge&s;t;
it gives a &s;tronger impul&s;e to the mind, and
renders le&s;s intimate relations to the pre&s;ent
object, &s;ufficient for bringing the&s;e ideas into
view. Merely to think of darkne&s;s, does not
lead us &s;o readily or &s;o nece&s;&s;arily to the con|ception
of its oppo&s;ite, light, as our being
actually involved in darkne&s;s. The &s;ight of
a &s;hip peri&s;hing in a &s;torm, not only rai&s;es
&s;tronger emotions, but likewi&s;e introduces a
much greater variety of ideas into the mind,
than barely reading or hearing of a &s;hip|wre$k:
in the latter ca&s;e, it &s;ometimes makes
&s;o little impre&s;&s;ion upon us, as not to give
ri&s;e to any train of ideas. The mention or
the accidental recollection of a place where we
have &s;pent a con&s;iderable part of our lives,
<PB N="187" REF="194">
will bring to mind occurrences which hap|pened
there; but every per&s;on has felt, that
vi&s;iting that place reminds him of many
more, and makes them ru&s;h into his thoughts
with much greater rapidity. The mention
of a per&s;on often makes us recollect that there
is &s;ome purpo&s;e for which we want to &s;ee
him; but &s;ometimes, when we cannot call to
mind what it particularly is, the &s;ight of
that per&s;on brings it quickly into our thoughts.
In con&s;equence of the &s;uperior force of &s;en&s;a|tions
which enables them to &s;ugge&s;t concep|tions
by means of much weaker relations
than ideas can, it often happens, that an ob|ject
occurring to the &s;en&s;es, gives a very quick,
and &s;eemingly unaccountable turn to the cour&s;e
of the thoughts. It makes a man cea&s;e to
pur&s;ue a train of &s;entiments connected with
his former ideas by the &s;tronge&s;t relations,
and run into &s;uch as are much more weakly
related to the object which he perceives by
&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT, on the other hand, there are ca&s;es in
which the idea of an object will &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch
thoughts as the &s;en&s;ation of that object could
not have &s;ugge&s;ted. This happens chie&s;tly
when objects are of &s;uch a nature, that the
&s;en&s;ation of them is exceeding &s;trong and in|tere&s;ts
<PB N="188" REF="195">
us very deeply, when, for in&s;tance, it
is in a high degree plea&s;ant or painful, or
when it produces any &s;trong or violent pa&s;|&s;ion.
In the&s;e ca&s;es, it engro&s;&s;es our whole
attention, and by doing &s;o, prevents ideas
from occurring, which would have been na|tually
&s;ugge&s;ted by a mere idea of that object
becau&s;e the idea would not have occupied the
mind &s;o much. Many of the ob&s;ervations
which we have already made concerning the
pa&s;&s;ions, may be ea&s;ily applied to the illu&s;tra|tion
of this po&s;tion. To confirm it by a
&s;eparate example, relations of tortures &s;ome|times
&s;ugge&s;t a variety of conceptions of different
kinds; but it is remarked, that the
&s;ight of tortures chills the whole &s;oul, and
produces almo&s;t a total &s;tagnation of thought.</P>
<P>A PERSON has always &s;en&s;ations of tho&s;e
objects which belong to his own &s;tate and
condition; others, who ob&s;erve his &s;ituation,
conceive the &s;ame objects only in idea. Hence
there ari&s;es often a great difference between
the train of thoughts which are rai&s;ed in a
per&s;on by the &s;en&s;e of his own &s;ituation, and
that train which ob&s;ervation of his &s;ituation
introduces into the minds of others. The
thoughts, reflections, and &s;entiments of a
per&s;on who actually feels pain or &s;ickne&s;s, are
<PB N="189" REF="196">
generally different in &s;everal re&s;pects, from
tho&s;e of the per&s;ons who vi&s;it him; the&s;e often
engage in conver&s;ation, even relating to his
di&s;tre&s;s, into which he can by no means enter.
Suppo&s;e a per&s;on rai&s;ed from meanne&s;s to
great pro&s;perity or dignity; his own &s;enti|ments
are very unlike to the reflections of
&s;pectators. The vivacity with which he per|ceives
it, the force with which it lays hold of
him by means of the &s;en&s;es, leads him into
many thoughts which the idea of it has not
power enough to &s;ugge&s;t to others. But at
the &s;ame time it &s;carce at all leads him to
think of &s;ome things which mo&s;t readily occur
to the re&s;t of the world. The contra&s;t be|tween
his pre&s;ent and his former &s;ituation, is
one of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural reflections
that the world makes: but there are many
reflections into which the man him&s;elf runs
more ea&s;ily and more frequently. His pre|&s;ent
&s;ituation makes &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion
on him, that he attends chieftly to &s;uch ideas
as are &s;uitable to it; it excites many agree|able
pa&s;&s;ions, the&s;e increa&s;e his propen&s;ity to
attend only to agreeable perceptions: his for|mer
meanne&s;s is in the main mortifying, and
therefore the whole of his temper oppo&s;es his
running into the contemplation of it. Many
<PB N="190" REF="197">
regard both the pre&s;ent and the pa&s;t &s;tate of
another with great indifference; neither af|fects
them much, neither rai&s;es any pa&s;&s;ion;
they con&s;ider both without any emotion,
merely as objects expo&s;ed to their view: the&s;e
objects can &s;ugge&s;t ideas to them, only by
their natural relations to other objects; and
therefore they run freely into whatever
thoughts the&s;e relations &s;ugge&s;t: contrariety
is one of the&s;e relations; its force is the
greater in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e the oppo&s;ite con|ditions
belong to the &s;ame per&s;on; and by
means of it, the man's former condition is
readily brought into view. Some again ob|&s;erve
&s;uch a change of fortune happening to
another, not without &s;ome emotion. When|ever
for in&s;tance, the idea of it occurs to one
per&s;on, it is attended with envy, and this
pa&s;&s;ion augments its power to &s;ugge&s;t his for|mer
meanne&s;s, and turns it when it is &s;ug|ge&s;ted,
into &s;uch a form as makes it &s;eem to
fully or ob&s;cure his pre&s;ent elevation. On
the contrary, in the mind of the benevolent,
&s;uch good fortune produces joy; the per&s;on's
former ob&s;curity, by rendering the good for|tune
the greater, tends to &s;upport and rai&s;e
that joy, and therefore finds ready acce&s;s to
the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="198">
IN a word, the train of &s;entiments intro|duced
by an object, varies con&s;iderably accord|ing
as a per&s;on has him&s;elf a &s;en&s;ation of that
object, or only ob&s;erves one who has; and
that both becau&s;e the immediate effect of
<HI>&s;en&s;ations</HI> on a&s;&s;ociation, are different in many

give ri&s;e to different pa&s;&s;ions and emotions.
Every one who would give a natural repre|&s;entation
of thoughts and &s;entiments, mu&s;t
attend to this principle: it has therefore a
near relation to every &s;pecies of genius which
is conver&s;ant about characters. It has likewi&s;e
a more exten&s;ive influence upon genius: &s;en|timents
&s;ugge&s;ted by a man's own &s;ituation,
mix with all the exertions of his genius, on
whatever &s;ubjects it be employed; and his
&s;ituation thus gives it &s;ome peculiarity, and
di&s;tingui&s;hes his productions from tho&s;e of
another man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t &s;imilar ge|nius,

<P>THUS a&s;&s;ociation is &s;u&s;ceptible of great va|rieties

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Combination of the a&s;&s;ociating Prin|ciples.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;everal principles of a&s;&s;ociation
which have been enumerated, are dif|ferent,
and &s;ome of them are very unlike to
others of them: every perception whatever is
connected with &s;ome ideas by &s;ome of the&s;e
principles, and with &s;ome ideas by other prin|ciples;
but often al&s;o a perception is connect|ed
with another by two or more of the&s;e
principles at once.</P>
<P>IT was impo&s;&s;ible to con&s;ider the a&s;&s;ociat|ing
principles &s;o much &s;eparately, as to pre|vent
many in&s;tances of this combination from
occurring in what has been already &s;aid, or
to avoid mentioning &s;ome of the con&s;equences
of it. We have found examples of habit and
of pa&s;&s;ion concurring with &s;ome of the rela|tions
of ideas, in &s;ugge&s;ting the &s;ame thought.
Different relations of ideas may be combined
in like manner. A thing which re&s;embles
another, may at the &s;ame time be contiguous
to it, or be its cau&s;e, or its effect. Morton,

relating in what manner Piercy's fall deprived
his troops of courage, &s;ays,

<L>And as the thing that's heavy in it&s;elf,</L>
<L>Upon enforcement flies with greate&s;t &s;peed:</L>
<L>So did our men, heavy in Hot&s;pur's lo&s;s,</L>
<L>Lend to this weight &s;uch lightne&s;s with their fear,</L>
<L>That arrows fled not &s;wifter toward their aim,</L>
<L>Than did our &s;oldiers, aiming at their &s;afety,</L>
<L>Fly from the field.&mdash;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Second part of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. act 1. &s;cene 3.</NOTE></L></Q>
The &s;everal images here employed; <HI>&s;teel
lo&s;ing its temper; heavy things moving fa&s;ter
than light things, when they are projected
with &s;ufficient force; arrows flying to a mark;</HI>
have &s;uch a degree of re&s;emblance to the de|jection
and flight of brave &s;oldiers, as is &s;uffi|cient
to render them proper &s;imilitudes: but
in this ca&s;e, they are not &s;ugge&s;ted to the
poet by re&s;emblance alone; being things em|ployed
in war, they have all a kind of vici|nity
to what happened in the field of battle;
the u&s;e that is made of them in war, connects
them with it by a &s;pecies of cau&s;ation; and
therefore they have a &s;tronger relation to the
&s;ubject de&s;cribed, than images which only re|&s;emble
<PB N="194" REF="201">
it, though in the mo&s;t perfect man|ner.
The power of the&s;e complicated rela|tions
has hurried on the poet to pur&s;ue and to
accumulate the images, more than is con&s;i&s;t|ent
with perfect &s;implicity and correctne&s;s.
Ju&s;tin was led by the &s;ame co-operation of
principles, to the choice of the &s;imilitude by
which he illu&s;trates the effect of the death of
Epaminondas, on the &s;pirit of the Thebans,
a &s;imilitude too remote to have otherwi&s;e
come into his mind: &startq;For as, if you break
off the point of a weapon, you take from
the re&s;t of the iron the power of hurting,
&s;o that General of the Thebans, being taken
away, like the point of the weapon, the
power al&s;o of the &s;tate was deadened<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Nam &s;icuti telo &s;i primam aciem praefregeris, reliquo ferro vim nocendi &s;u&s;tuleris; &s;ic illo, velut mucrone teli, ab|lato duce Thebanorum, rei quoque publicae virea he|betatae &s;unt. <HI>Hi&s;t.</HI> lib. vi. cap. 8.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary to multiply examples of
the combination of different a&s;&s;ociating quali|ties;
to conceive this, is not a matter of any
difficulty. But it will be proper to make an
ob&s;ervation which &s;erves to render &s;ome of our
former conclu&s;ions more preci&s;e and determi|nate.
We could &s;carce avoid mentioning
<HI>contrariety</HI> as an a&s;&s;ociating quality, becau&s;e
it &s;ometimes connects ideas by it&s;elf, and be|cau&s;e
<PB N="195" REF="202">
often when it is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by other rela|tions,
it is notwith&s;tanding the chief and
prevalent relation. But from a review of the
examples which were given, it will appear,
that for the mo&s;t part, when contrariety
unites ideas, it is combined with &s;ome other
relation. One thing, for in&s;tance, &s;ugge&s;ts
its contrary when both belong to the &s;ame
&s;ubject, in many ca&s;es where it would not
&s;ugge&s;t it, if they belonged to different &s;ub|jects.
It is when oppo&s;ite fortunes happen
by a remarkable rever&s;e, to the &s;ame per&s;on,
that they irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;ugge&s;t each other.</P>
<P>ONE effect of the combination of different
a&s;&s;ociating principles, has been often hinted at
already. That combination produces a clo&s;er
and &s;tronger relation between perceptions, than
either of the principles alone: one of the
perceptions introduces the other with a double
force, and therefore in preference to tho&s;e
which are connected with it only by a &s;ingle
tie.</P>
<P>THIS combination likewi&s;e contributes
greatly to the <HI>force</HI> and extent of genius.
It &s;upplies the imagination with many means
of apprehending the conceptions for which it
has occa&s;ion. If a per&s;on be not affected by
one of the relations which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between a
<PB N="196" REF="203">
pr&s;ent perception and an idea which &s;uits his
purpo&s;e, he may be affected by another of
them. If neither of the relations &s;ingly have
force enough to operate upon his imagina|tion,
they may derive &s;ufficient force from
their union, and be able together to lead him
readily to the di&s;covery of &s;uch appo&s;ite ma|terials
as otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t have mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THIS combination contributes not only to
increa&s;e the force of genius, but al&s;o to diver|&s;i&s;y
its <HI>form.</HI> The &s;eparate principles of a&s;&s;o|ciation
being &s;o numerous as they are, mu&s;t
be &s;u&s;ceptible of an almo&s;t infinite number of
combinations; and every po&s;&s;ible combina|tion
of them con&s;titutes a new ground of
union among perceptions, which will be &s;ub|&s;ervient
to genius. Any pre&s;ent perception
will &s;ugge&s;t a thou&s;and different ideas to as
many different per&s;ons, according to the dif|ferent
a&s;&s;ociating principles or combinations
of principles by which they are affected;
and this will produce a corre&s;pondent diver|&s;ity
both in the &s;ub&s;tance and in the &s;tructure
of their works.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Modifications of the a&s;&s;ociating Prin|ciples.</HEAD>
<P>AS the principles of a&s;&s;ociation may be
combined with endle&s;s variety, &s;o each
principle is &s;u&s;ceptible of different forms or
modifications. This was hinted before; it
will now be proper to explain it.</P>
<P>VICINITY admits degrees; for objects do
not &s;ugge&s;t tho&s;e only which are properly
contiguous; but it admits not any diver&s;ity
in kind, except what was already taken no|tice
of, that it may be referred either to place
or to time. But all the other principles of
a&s;&s;ociation are &s;u&s;ceptible of much greater
varieties.</P>
<P>RESEMBLANCE not only takes place in
different <HI>degrees,</HI> but al&s;o is of different
<HI>kinds.</HI> The difference is only in degree, when
the &s;ame quality of an object is the ground of
its re&s;emblance to &s;everal different things:
one thing may re&s;emble &s;everal others, in co|lour,
&s;uppo&s;e; but re&s;embles them more or
le&s;s, according to the different &s;hades of that
colour, which belong to them. Again, the
<PB N="198" REF="205">
difference is only in degree, when it ari&s;es
from things po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame qualities in
common, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing more or fewer of
them. One quality common to two objects,
forms a real re&s;emblance between them; but
the re&s;emblance is much more perfect when
they have &s;everal common qualities: all ani|mals,
or all vegetables, have &s;ome degree of
re&s;emblance; animals or vegetables of the
&s;ame cla&s;s, have a greater re&s;emblance; tho&s;e
of the &s;ame genus, &s;till a greater; the indi|viduals
of the &s;ame &s;pecies, yet a greater;
and &s;ome of the individuals have a much more
perfect re&s;emblance than others.</P>
<P>BUT farther, one thing may re&s;emble &s;everal
others, by means of its different qualities; it
may re&s;emble &s;ome by its colour, others by its
&s;mell, others by its figure, others by its &s;ize:
each of the&s;e forms a different kind of re&s;em|blance;
for neither the qualities them&s;elves,
nor the &s;imilitudes ari&s;ing from them, can
admit compari&s;on in re&s;pect of degree. Hence
any one thing is capable of as many &s;orts of
re&s;emblance to other things, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
di&s;tinct qualities. It is capable of many
more.</P>
<P>IT not only re&s;embles &s;ome things by its
particular, definite, con&s;tituent qualities, as
<PB N="199" REF="206">
in the in&s;tances already given: it may re|&s;emble
other things by &s;ome general charac|ter
belonging to &s;ome of its qualities. Sweet|ne&s;s
originally and properly belongs to ta&s;tes;
but in a figurative &s;en&s;e we &s;peak of &s;weet
colours, &s;weet &s;ounds, &s;weet di&s;po&s;itions; we
intend to expre&s;s &s;ome character common to
the&s;e di&s;tinct qualities, which produces a re|&s;emblance
among them, &s;o obvious that it has
rendered the figure ordinary in all languages,
if not &s;trictly univer&s;al.</P>
<P>A THING may likewi&s;e re&s;emble others, by
a &s;ort of general appearance re&s;ulting from
all its qualities, or from &s;everal of them. Of
this kind are the general likene&s;&s;es which are
often ob&s;erved between the faces and the airs
of different per&s;ons.</P>
<P>IT may re&s;emble other things, by bearing
the &s;ame relation to &s;ome object, which they
bear to the &s;ame object, or even to kindred
objects, nay to objects in no way connected;
by proceeding from the &s;ame cau&s;e, or by
proceeding from a &s;imilar cau&s;e, or by pro|ceeding
from a totally different cau&s;e in a
&s;omewhat &s;imilar manner; or by producing
&s;imilar effects, or by producing its peculiar
effects in a &s;imilar manner. Re&s;emblances of
this &s;ort, however &s;light or remote they may
<PB N="200" REF="207">
be thought at fir&s;t &s;ight, are &s;o clo&s;e and ju&s;t,
that they are &s;ufficient for producing a tran|&s;ition
from one object to another, which can|not
be reckoned unnatural, even when a per|&s;on
is under the influence of a pa&s;&s;ion: Ba&s;&s;anio
overjoyed at Portia's having accepted his love,
&s;ays,
<Q><L>Madam, you have bere&s;t me of all words,</L>
<L>Only my blood &s;peaks to you in my veins;</L>
<L>And there is &s;uch confu&s;ion in my pow'rs,</L>

<L>Among the buzzing, plea&s;ed multitude,</L>
<L>Where every &s;omething being blent together,</L>
<L>Turns to a wild of nothing, &s;ave of joy</L>
<L>Expre&s;t, and not expre&s;t.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Merchant of Venice,</HI> act 3. &s;cene 2.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>The cau&s;e of his joy is compared to what
re&s;embles it in no re&s;pect except in pro|ducing
a &s;imilar effect upon the mind, a like
confu&s;ed &s;en&s;ation of joy. If that compari&s;on
&s;hould by any be thought not entirely natural
in a per&s;on's expre&s;&s;ion of his own pa&s;&s;ion,
yet it will be acknowledged by all, that in a
de&s;cription of that pa&s;&s;ion, the compari&s;on
would be unexceptionable; and this is a &s;uffi|cient
proof, that the re&s;emblance is a proper
ground of a&s;&s;ociation. The ju&s;tine&s;s of the&s;e
<PB N="201" REF="208">
&s;orts of re&s;emblance appears farther from this,
that they have given ri&s;e to compari&s;ons and
metaphors which &s;how them&s;elves to be natu|tral
by being adopted in all ages and nations:
it is in &s;ome of the indirect ways now men|tioned,
that light re&s;embles knowlege, joy,
goodne&s;s, and perfection; yet light is one of
the mo&s;t beautiful and natural emblems of all
the&s;e. The re&s;emblance which takes place
between &s;imple perceptions of the &s;ame cla&s;s,
between different &s;mells, for in&s;tance, &s;eems
to belong to &s;ome of the kinds now under
con&s;ideration. Simple perceptions being void
of compo&s;ition, can &s;carce have &s;ome qualities
in common, and other qualities which di&s;tin|gui&s;h
them; our notion of their re&s;emblance
mu&s;t proceed from their affecting the mind in
ways, the &s;imilarity of which we perceive,
though we cannot perhaps explain it, or from
our pre&s;uming that they proceed from cau&s;es
&s;omehow clo&s;ely related.</P>
<P>IN a word, there is no quality, no relation,
no action of an object, no point of view in
which we can con&s;ider it, but may be the foun|dation
of a re&s;emblance between it and &s;ome
other. The re&s;emblance is often of a very
delicate nature, and yet very obvious and
&s;trong; we readily feel it, but &s;ometimes we

can &s;carce at all define whence it ari&s;es, or of

<P>CONTRARIETY, in the extent in which it is
generally under&s;tood, and in which it pro|motes
a&s;&s;ociation, is reducible to &s;everal dif|ferent
&s;pecies. By contrariety is &s;ometimes

di&s;tance; as when bitter is &s;aid to be contrary
to &s;weet; and in this &s;en&s;e it admits many
degrees. In another &s;en&s;e, objects are called
contrary, when one is only the negation or
ab&s;ence of the other; thus darkne&s;s and light,
health and &s;ickne&s;s, are contraries<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cicero takes notice of the&s;e two kinds, though under different names; Contrarium e&s;t, quod po&s;itum in genere di|ver&s;o, ab eodem cui contrarium e&s;&s;e dicitur, plurimum di&s;tat, ut frigus calori, vitae mors.

objects are contraries in a &s;till more proper
&s;en&s;e, as plea&s;ure and pain, hope and fear, love

the&s;e kinds of contrariety, and &s;ometimes all
the three, run into one another by an ea&s;y
gradation: rich and poor are terms of contra|riety,
but they expre&s;s, at different times, all
the three &s;pecies of contrariety; poverty &s;ome|times
&s;ignifies only a very inferior degree of
riches, and then the contrariety is of the fir&s;t

in which ca&s;e the contrariety is of the &s;econd
kind; but if the per&s;on to who&s;e condition
the word is applied be in debt, the contrariety
is of the third kind.</P>
<P>OBJECTS which, con&s;idered &s;imply in them|&s;elves,
could not be reckoned contraries, yet
come to be regarded as &s;uch, when either
their cau&s;es or their effects are contrary in any
of the &s;en&s;es that have been mentioned. Heat
and cold are perhaps termed contraries, ra|ther
on account of the contrariety of their
cau&s;es and of their effects, than of any oppo|&s;ition
between the two &s;en&s;ations them&s;elves.
Acids and alkalis, a&s;tringents and laxatives,
&s;eptics and anti&s;eptics, are denominated con|traries,
merely on account of the contrariety
of &s;ome of their effects.</P>
<P>OF <HI>co-exi&s;tence</HI> al&s;o there are many different
modifications. Tho&s;e qualities which are

which together form the character of the &s;pe|cies,
and would be enumerated in a ju&s;t defi|nition
of it, &s;eem to have a co-exi&s;tence &s;ome|what
<PB N="204" REF="211">
what different from tho&s;e which are peculiar
to one or a few individuals. The&s;e two &s;orts
of qualities influence a&s;&s;ociation differently:
a quality of the former &s;ort mo&s;t readily &s;ug|ge&s;ts
the idea of the &s;pecies; one of the latter
&s;ort, the idea of the individual. Some qua|lities
of the latter &s;ort are permanent in the
individual; others are temporary: the&s;e are,
at a particular time, really as in&s;eparable from
it, as tho&s;e are; yet they can &s;carce be con|&s;idered
as belonging to it by a co-exi&s;tence
equally clo&s;e, though it is &s;o &s;trong as very
readily to produce a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>NOT only the e&s;&s;ential qualities of a thing,
but circum&s;tances al&s;o which are not con|&s;idered
as entering into its &s;ub&s;tance, may
acquire a &s;ort of co-exi&s;tence with it, which
&s;hall act very powerfully on the imagination.
Thus whatever belongs to the condition of a
per&s;on, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, his pro&s;pects, all by
which he is di&s;tingui&s;hed from others, all that
can render the conception of him more deter|minate
or more &s;triking, acquire a connexion
with him, which produces a&s;&s;ociation. Nay,
things which have belonged to the &s;tate of the
&s;ame per&s;on at different times, as poverty and
riches, meanne&s;s and elevation, acquire, by
means of their relation to him, a connexion
<PB N="205" REF="212">
with one another, which there would be an
apparent impropriety in terming co-exi&s;tence,
but which affects the imagination in a man|ner
perfectly analogous. Whatever is clo&s;ely
or long connected with a thing, as an adjunct,
or a concomitant, or belongs to it in any way,
comes naturally to be con&s;idered as in &s;ome
&s;en&s;e co-exi&s;tent with it, and they will &s;ugge&s;t
one another. If we have &s;een a per&s;on at
any one time in a remarkable attitude, or
&s;ituation, or dre&s;s, we can &s;carce ever think
of him without conceiving it al&s;o. On the
other hand, a garment, a ring, the mo&s;t tri|fling
piece of dre&s;s, will produce a lively con|ception
of the per&s;on to whom it belonged.
Ovid gives us a natural picture of this in
Pyramus:
<Q><L>&mdash;Ut vero ve&s;tem quoque &s;anguine tinctam</L>
<L>Repperit; una duos nox, inquit, perdet amantes;</L>
<L>E quibus illa fuit longa digni&s;&s;ima vita.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Metamorph.</HI> lib. iv.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>SEVERAL di&s;tinct &s;ub&s;tances are often com|bined
into a &s;y&s;tem; and in that ca&s;e they are
con&s;idered as parts of one whole, and are
united in the imagination by the principle of
co-exi&s;tence. An army, a nation, a church,
is a whole, including &s;everal individuals, in a
<PB N="206" REF="213">
manner &s;imilar to that in which an individual
includes many different qualities.</P>
<P>WHAT we have &s;aid, does not perhaps
amount to a complete enumeration of all the
forms which co-exi&s;tence a&s;&s;umes; but it &s;uf|ficiently
evinces that this relation does a&s;&s;ume
a very great variety of forms.</P>
<P>IT would not be ea&s;y to pur&s;ue the relation
of <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> through all the forms in
which it operates on the imagination; but
many of the principal ones are very obvious.
What gives exi&s;tence to any thing, what makes
any change in it, what influences any of its
powers or virtues, what contributes to its pre|&s;ervation,
or to its de&s;truction, a mean for
an&s;wering any end, an argument for proving
any conclu&s;ion, a propo&s;ition from which a
corollary may be deduced, a motive to any &s;ort
of conduct; all the&s;e are called cau&s;es, but
plainly in very different &s;en&s;es; and they all
are, in the imagination, a&s;&s;ociated with their
&s;everal effects or con&s;equences. In the ex|amples
which we have had occa&s;ion to pro|duce,
mo&s;t of the&s;e modifications of cau&s;ation
have occurred. This relation makes a per|ception
of the cau&s;e, or of the effect, to in|troduce
the idea of its correlative, whether
<PB N="207" REF="214">
the effect be a &s;ub&s;tance or a mode, whether
the cau&s;e give exi&s;tence to the effect, or only
alter it, or in any way affect it, or have a
power of affecting it. But the relation has
greate&s;t force when it is mo&s;t perfect: a &s;er|vant
will not &s;o readily &s;ugge&s;t the idea of
his ma&s;ter, as a &s;on that of his father.</P>
<P>OBJECTS may be connected as cau&s;e and
effect, when one of them does not immedi|ately
produce or influence the other. What
is, in any of the &s;en&s;es now mentioned, a
cau&s;e, is connected not only with its imme|diate
effects, but al&s;o with the remote&s;t effects
of any thing produced or affected by it. In
a &s;eries of things where each is the imme|diate
cau&s;e of what &s;ucceeds it, the la&s;t effect
really-depends upon the first cau&s;e. Some|times
we are ignorant of many of the inter|mediate
&s;teps, and regard that as the neare&s;t,
which is only a remote cau&s;e: an ordinary
man reckons the motion of his hand the im|mediate
effect of his volition, becau&s;e he knows
nothing of the mu&s;cles by which his hand is
moved. But even when we are acquainted
with the whole chain of cau&s;es and effects,
the effect will &s;ometimes &s;ugge&s;t a remote
cau&s;e, without our ever thinking of the inter|vening
links; or the remote cau&s;e will di|rectly
<PB N="208" REF="215">
introduce the idea of the effect which
&s;prings from it by the mediation of many &s;ub|ordinate
cau&s;es, while to the&s;e we do not at
all attend. Thus when there has been one
among a per&s;on's ance&s;tors very eminent,
though at a great di&s;tance of time, it is natu|ral
both for the per&s;on him&s;elf and for others
to direct their thoughts to that one. Horace
in addre&s;&s;ing his patron, mentions not his fa|ther,
but much remoter ance&s;tors;
<Q><L>Maecenas, atavis edite regibus.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lib. I. Od. 1.</NOTE></L>
<L>Tyrrhena regum progenies.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Lib. III&#62; Od. 29.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>This principle is &s;ometimes &s;o powerful, that
a per&s;on finds him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to give a fa|mily,
or even a nation, a name formed from
that of their founder, many ages after his
death. Such is the epithet which Virgil gives
his countrymen long after the time of Romulus;
<Q><L>&mdash;Subitoque novum con&s;urgere bellum
Romulidis.&mdash;<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aeneid.</HI> Lib. VIII.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>As the &s;ame cau&s;e &s;ometimes produces many
different effects, all the&s;e effects, however di&s;|&s;imilar,
are connected with one another by
means of their relation to the common cau&s;e,
<PB N="209" REF="216">
and by virtue of this connexion one of the
effects will lead us to think of the other. Heat
and light are both effects of fire; and one
of them being perceived, naturally &s;ugge&s;ts
the other. Sometimes one effect &s;ugge&s;ts the
idea of the cau&s;e, and this introduces the idea
of the other effect. The &s;ight of a &s;on will
lead us to think of the father, and the thought
of him will introduce a di&s;cour&s;e or enquiry
concerning his other children. Sometimes
again one effect will introduce the idea of
another effect, without fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ting the
idea of their common cau&s;e. The &s;ight of a
per&s;on may di&s;po&s;e us to think of a brother,
without our once thinking of the parents, by
means of whom they are related to each other.
In this ca&s;e, it &s;eems to be a &s;pecies of re&s;em|blance
that produces the a&s;&s;ociation; the two
effects are like in this particular, that they
are derived from the &s;ame cau&s;e. In like
manner, when two or more objects are joint
cau&s;es of the &s;ame effects, they are related to
one another, and the perception of the one
readily carries the thoughts to the other.</P>
<P>ORDER, as well as the other relations which
promote a&s;&s;ociation, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into
different &s;pecies.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="217">
THERE is an order in place. The or|der
of things in place may &s;eem &s;ometimes
to promote a&s;&s;ociation almo&s;t only by the in|fluence
of vicinity. Thus the thinking of
one of a company, will fir&s;t lead us to think
of the per&s;on who &s;at contiguous to him, then
of another who was next to this &s;econd, and
&s;o on, till we have gone through the whole
company in the order in which they happened
to be placed. Here the order of the per&s;ons,
by which the imagination is affected, appears
to be little different from vicinity. But it
really is &s;omewhat different: we may &s;up|po&s;e
the &s;ame number of per&s;ons of which
the company con&s;i&s;ted, &s;tanding together in
a confu&s;ed crowd: in this &s;ituation, they may
be more clo&s;ely contiguous than before; but
they have not order, and therefore one of
them will not &s;o readily &s;ugge&s;t the re&s;t, nor
will it be &s;o ea&s;y to recollect them all. What
then is the difference between the&s;e two &s;itu|ations?
Formerly the&s;e per&s;ons did compo&s;e
a regular figure, now they do not. Order,
therefore, even of the &s;imple&s;t kind, includes
regularity of figure, as well as vicinity; and
by means of that regularity, order a&s;&s;ociates
ideas more &s;trongly than vicinity alone. But
<PB N="211" REF="218">
order in place often implies more; it ari&s;es
from tho&s;e things or parts of things being
placed contiguous, which are connected by
other relations. Thus a number of per&s;ons
may be placed, not only in &s;ome regular
figure, but in a farther order, according to
their &s;ex, age, or dignity. In this ca&s;e, the
a&s;&s;ociating force of order, is made up of the
united forces of contiguity, and of the rela|tions
which the things or parts bear to one
another, independent of their contiguity.
The parts of a watch are placed in order,
when each part is contiguous to tho&s;e from
which it receives, and to which it communi|cates
motion. In con&s;equence of this, the
idea of any one part will lead us to conceive
the part next to it, or to conceive all the parts,
or will &s;ugge&s;t an idea of the whole, much
more ea&s;ily and quickly than it could, if we
only con&s;idered that part as laid in a heap
along with the re&s;t: yet in a heap, the parts
might have had clo&s;er contiguity, than in the
machine.</P>
<P>THERE is likewi&s;e an order in time. It
ari&s;es from placing tho&s;e things in immediate
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which are related by re&s;emblance
cau&s;ation, or any other relation. Succe&s;&s;ion
alone would a&s;&s;ociate the ideas, though their
<PB N="212" REF="219">
objects were not otherwi&s;e related; the&s;e re|lations
would a&s;&s;ociate them, though the things
had not been &s;ucce&s;&s;ive; both being combined
in order, it mu&s;t have great power to produce
a&s;&s;ociation. In a regular proce&s;&s;ion, per&s;ons
not only follow one another, but are di&s;po&s;ed
according to their rank and dignity: in con|&s;equence
of this, either the view, or a de&s;crip|tion
of a &s;mall part of a proce&s;&s;ion, is enough
to enable the imagination to pa&s;s along all the
other parts, and to take in a conception of the
whole. Succe&s;&s;ive events are generally con|nected
as cau&s;es and effects: when they are,
they will readily occur to every per&s;on in the
order in which they happened, and influenced
one another; every narration may &s;ugge&s;t
examples of this. But when &s;ucce&s;&s;ive objects
happen not to be thus connected, they are
&s;lightly a&s;&s;ociated by mere &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In a
chronological table, events are connected by
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion alone; in a regular hi&s;tory, by or|der;
in this la&s;t ca&s;e, there is a much greater
union of the parts, than in the former. The
other relations which, in order, are joined
with &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, have &s;o con&s;iderable force,
that an hi&s;torian often gives the mo&s;t perfect
order to his narration, by bringing together
events in it, which have a natural connexion,
<PB N="213" REF="220">
though they did not happen in immediate &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
and is, without reflection or de&s;ign,
led to adopt this order.</P>
<P>THERE is likewi&s;e what may be called an
order of nature. This has often a great ana|logy
to order in place and in time. It is no
wonder that it &s;hould, &s;ince we conceive all
things as connected both with place and with
time. Order in both &s;eems to be, in &s;ome in|&s;tances,
e&s;tabli&s;hed by nature; our thoughts
move ea&s;ily in tracing de&s;cent, or in following
the cour&s;e of time, but with difficulty in tra|cing
a&s;cent, or in going backward in time. But
&s;till the &s;pecies of order now under con&s;idera|tion,
is different from the other two. In
many ca&s;es, there is a natural order in things
them&s;elves: hence one manner of con&s;idering
them, is according to order, and another con|trary
to it; our thoughts mu&s;t proceed in that
natural order, el&s;e their progre&s;s is ob&s;tructed.
In conceiving a man, our thoughts pa&s;s rea|dily
from the head downwards; it is in many
re&s;pects the principal part of the body, and
by it that nouri&s;hment is conveyed, which
&s;u&s;tains the whole. In conceiving a tree we
proceed upwards from the root to the &s;tem
and the branches: it is from the fir&s;t that
the&s;e latter parts derive their nouri&s;hment,
<PB N="214" REF="221">
and by it they are &s;upported; there is al&s;o a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion in their fir&s;t production, they grow
up gradually from the root: both the&s;e cau&s;es
have an influence on the cour&s;e of our
thoughts. In conceiving a hou&s;e, the mind,
in like manner, naturally a&s;cends from the
bottom to the top, and for the &s;ame rea&s;ons;
the inferiour parts &s;upport the &s;uperiour; the
building proceeds from the foundation up|wards:
be&s;ides, if we would go into the hou&s;e,
we mu&s;t a&s;cend from the ground towards the
roof; the mind takes the &s;ame cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE are perhaps &s;ome ca&s;es in which
cu&s;tom alone fixes a certain order; but after
cu&s;tom has fixt it, it operates as &s;trongly on
the mind, as if it had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by na|ture.
Writing from right to left, or from
left to right, is determined merely by cu&s;tom;
but in con&s;equence of that cu&s;tom, an Euro|pean
finds difficulty in tracing the combina|tion
of letters in the former direction, and an
Oriental finds equal difficulty in tracing that
combination in the latter direction.</P>
<P>THUS every one of the a&s;&s;ociating princi|ples
a&s;&s;umes many different forms; and every
di&s;tinct form which any of them can a&s;&s;ume,
may be con&s;idered as a &s;eparate relation, and
nece&s;&s;arily produces a corre&s;pondent peculia|rity
<PB N="215" REF="222">
in the exertion of genius, which is di|rected
by it. The &s;everal modifications of
the&s;e principles mu&s;t contribute both to in|crea&s;e
the force, and to diver&s;ify the form of
genius, in the very &s;ame ways, as it has been
already &s;hown that the variety of their com|binations
does.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Predominance of the a&s;&s;ociating
Principles.</HEAD>
<P>THE ob&s;ervations which we have hitherto
made, &s;how that there mu&s;t be great
differences and di&s;&s;imilitudes in the effects of
genius; for they lead us to perceive that it may
proceed from one conception to another in an
infinite variety of ways. But in order to ex|plain,
in what manner the multitude of the
a&s;&s;ociating qualities lays a foundation for per|manent
diver&s;ities of genius, &s;ome farther ob|&s;ervations
will be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>ALL the a&s;&s;ociating principles have &s;ome
degree of force in every man. There is per|haps
no per&s;on on whom any one of them has
no influence at all. But in almo&s;t every man,
&s;ome one of them is predominant: on every
&s;ubject, a man is apt to follow one relation;
<PB N="216" REF="223">
rather than any other, and to conceive chiefly
&s;uch ideas as are, by that relation, connected
with the pre&s;ent perception. Whence this
proceeds, is perhaps inexplicable; it mu&s;t,
in a great mea&s;ure, be re&s;olved into original
differences in the con&s;titution of the mind:
but the thing it&s;elf is evident in the mo&s;t &s;im|ple
and common in&s;tances. If different per|&s;ons
&s;et them&s;elves to recollect a company, one
naturally recollects it by running over the
places occupied by tho&s;e who compo&s;ed it;
another enumerates them according to their
&s;everal profe&s;&s;ions, conditions, ages, or &s;exes;
another according to their re&s;pective families
and connexions: in the fir&s;t per&s;on, vicinity
or order; in the &s;econd, re&s;emblance; in the
third, the relation of cau&s;e and effect, is the
predominant principle of a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>WHEN any object is conceived by a per&s;on,
all its qualities are in &s;ome mea&s;ure pre&s;ent to
his view: but in con&s;equence of original dif|ferences
in the turn of men's imaginations,
one man's attention is fixt chiefly on one of
the&s;e qualities, and another man's attention
on a different quality. This is, in many
ca&s;es, the immediate cau&s;e of the predomi|nance
of one a&s;&s;ociating principle. The dif|ferent
qualities of an object not only lay a
<PB N="217" REF="224">
foundation for a connexion between it and
different objects, but al&s;o connect it with tho&s;e
different objects by means of different rela|tions;
and each per&s;on is affected by that re|lation;
which belongs to the quality on which
he mo&s;t readily fixes his attention. A few
per&s;ons can &s;carce engage in a conver&s;ation
on any &s;ubject, without affording an example
of this. Whatever it be that is fir&s;t intro|duced,
almo&s;t every per&s;on con&s;iders it in a
different point of view, and in con&s;equence
of this runs into a different train of thinking
and a different &s;et of reflections. When dia|logue
is conducted naturally, the &s;everal a&s;&s;o|ciating
qualities by which the &s;peakers are af|fected,
may be ea&s;ily traced out: each of
them goes on in a train &s;uited to his own turn
of imagination, and one of them &s;ometimes
in a train even oppo&s;ite to that which is pur|&s;ued
by another. By care to pre&s;erve this va|riety,
dialogue-writing is rendered natural;
and it is on account of the difficulty of pre|&s;erving
this variety, that &s;o few &s;ucceed in that
manner of writing.</P>
<P>AN original con&s;titution of mind is not the
only cau&s;e of a per&s;on's being influenced by
one a&s;&s;ociating principle more than by others:
it was formerly ob&s;erved, that this may pro|ceed
<PB N="218" REF="225">
from habit. But the habit generally
takes its ri&s;e from an original propen&s;ity to
follow chiefly one relation; it always takes
its ri&s;e from this, when its effects are perma|nent.
A diver&s;ity in the predominant prin|ciple
of a&s;&s;ociation, is often ob&s;ervable very
early in children, previous to the po&s;&s;ibility
of their having contracted habits of thinking,
and mu&s;t therefore be natural. If the origi|nal
propen&s;ity be weak, it may be over|powered
by other cau&s;es: but if it be &s;trong,
it will frequently exert it&s;elf; by frequent
exertion it will beget a habit of being influ|enced
by it; and by the formation of the
habit it will be confirmed. Still, therefore,
the predominance of one a&s;&s;ociating principle
or another, is, in mo&s;t ca&s;es at lea&s;t, ultimately
re&s;olvable into an original con&s;titution of the
mind.</P>
<P>HERE is a direct foundation for a perma|nent
variety of genius. In &s;ome man of ge|nius
or another, each of the a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciples
is predominant; and whichever of them
is, it forms a turn of genius &s;uitable to it, and
different from what the prevalence of any
other would have produced. Invention in
different arts and &s;ciences, is dependent on
very different relations of perceptions: genius
<PB N="219" REF="226">
for a particular art or &s;cience, will therefore
be formed by the prevalence of that principle
of a&s;&s;ociation which chiefly leads to invention
in it. In comparing the works of men of ge|nius,
we may find numberle&s;s illu&s;trations of
this: we may often find the &s;ame fact or the
&s;ame object pre&s;ent to the minds of the philo|&s;opher,
the hi&s;torian, the poet, the orator,
the painter; we may ob&s;erve that it leads each
of them a different road, or that they pa&s;s
from it to other ideas by different relations;
and by attending to the&s;e, we may be able to
a&s;certain and de&s;cribe the peculiarity of genius
in each of them.</P>
<P>WHAT has been now &s;aid of the different
principles of a&s;&s;ociation, is equally applicable
to all the different forms or modifications of
which it has been &s;hown that every one of
the&s;e principles is capable. There are various
kinds of re&s;emblance, for in&s;tance, of contra|riety,
of cau&s;ation; one man is naturally in|fluenced
chiefly by one kind, another by ano|ther
kind; the turn of genius in each is &s;uit|able
to that kind by which he is mo&s;t affected.
Hence mu&s;t ari&s;e many diver&s;ities of genius.
Whether a per&s;on pa&s;s from cau&s;es to effects,
or from effects to cau&s;es, his imagination is
influenced by the &s;ame relation: yet all men
<PB N="220" REF="227">
are not equally fitted for both. In mathema|tics,
one man is mo&s;t turned for algebra,
another for geometry. One excells in the
analytical part of philo&s;ophy, in re&s;olving
phenomena into their cau&s;es, and reducing
them to general laws; and another excells in
explaining the phenomena, in applying ge|neral
principles to a number of ca&s;es, and in
accounting for them elegantly and &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully.
Many of the fal&s;e &s;y&s;tems of philo&s;o|phy
which have made a figure in the world,
certainly di&s;play very con&s;iderable genius, but
genius of different kinds. Des Cartes de|duced
his whole philo&s;ophy from a few ge|neral
principles: he &s;howed a propen&s;ity to
pa&s;s from cau&s;es to their effects. Gilbert en|deavoured,
in a manner not at all de&s;titute of
ingenuity, to re&s;olve all the phenomena of
nature into magneti&s;m: the prevailing turn
of his imagination was to proceed from effects
to cau&s;es.</P>
<P>MOST commonly, the great divi&s;ions of ge|nius
ari&s;e from the prevalence of one <HI>principle</HI>
of a&s;&s;ociation or another; and the more mi|nute
varieties from the prevalence of different
<HI>modifications</HI> of the &s;ame principle. Yet the&s;e
modifications are &s;ometimes &s;o di&s;&s;imilar, that
the predominance of one or another of them
<PB N="221" REF="228">
produces a difference of genius as great as
could be produced by the predominance of
principles totally di&s;tinct. In a mere recital
of facts, there is &s;carce any room for genius:
but the true hi&s;torian does not con&s;ine him&s;elf
to &s;uch recital; he places facts in connexion,
he ri&s;es to the &s;ources of actions, and he pur|&s;ues
them through their con&s;equences: it is
in this that hi&s;torical genius appears; and in
this the hi&s;torian is plainly actuated by the
relation of cau&s;e and effect. The &s;ame actions
which the hi&s;torian relates, may be al&s;o con|&s;idered
by the philo&s;opher, their motives at|tended
to, and conclu&s;ions deduced from them,
concerning the con&s;titution of human nature:
in this he is influenced by the &s;ame relation
of cau&s;e and effect, but by a different &s;pecies
of it; and accordingly he &s;hows a kind of ge|nius
totally di&s;tinct from that of the hi&s;torian.
I &s;hall give an example which is &s;till more
&s;triking. In reducing bodies to regular divi|&s;ions
and &s;ubdivi&s;ions, the natural hi&s;torian is
conducted altogether by the principle of re|&s;emblance;
in adorning a &s;ubject with &s;imiles
and metaphors, the poet is likewi&s;e under the
influence of the principle of re&s;emblance:
yet no two &s;orts of genius are perhaps more
different than that for natural hi&s;tory, and
<PB N="222" REF="229">
that for poetry. In accounting for the phe|nomena
of bodies, the philo&s;opher follows a
quite different relation, that of cau&s;e and ef|fect;
but the genius of a natural hi&s;torian,
is much more akin to philo&s;ophical, than to
poetical genius.</P>
<P>BUT farther; Not only the prevalence of
different forms of the &s;ame a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciple,
is &s;ufficient for producing very di&s;&s;imi|lar
turns of genius; but al&s;o one of the&s;e
forms only operating in &s;omewhat different
manners, has force enough to mark genius
with a perceptible peculiarity. An image is
always connected with a &s;ubject by re&s;em|blance:
but the image may be applied either
in a compari&s;on or in a metaphor; and one
per&s;on is led by the turn of his imagination
chiefly to the u&s;e of the one, and another per|&s;on
chiefly to the u&s;e of the other of the&s;e
figures. Here a diver&s;ity of genius, &s;o con&s;i|derable
that it may become in &s;ome degree
characteri&s;tical, ari&s;es from a very &s;mall dif|ference
in the manner in which two per&s;ons
pa&s;s from one perception to another by means
of the very &s;ame relation, from their only
pa&s;&s;ing with different degrees of rapidity, and
con&s;idering the re&s;embling object with diffe|rent
degrees of deliberation. Nay, though two
<PB N="223" REF="230">
poets illu&s;trate their &s;ubjects by the &s;ame com|pari&s;on,
they may di&s;play a variety of genius
by their different manners of pur&s;uing it:
one is happy at &s;etting the main image full in
view by one bold &s;troke; the other traces the
likene&s;s minutely, and thus introduces ele|gance
into his work. When differences &s;o
minute in the form of the &s;ame a&s;&s;ociating
principle, and even in the manner of our
yielding to the &s;ame form of any of the a&s;&s;o|ciating
principles, can give a peculiar turn to
the imagination, there mu&s;t evidently be room
for a prodigious variety in genius.</P>
<P>WE would be apt to take it for granted,
that the a&s;&s;ociating force of any relation mu&s;t
be in proportion to the degree of that relation.
The more perfect the relation is between two
perceptions, the more clo&s;ely, we would ex|pect,
they &s;hall be united in the imagination,
and the more readily &s;hall one of them &s;ugge&s;t
the other. If re&s;emblance, for in&s;tance, be
what gives one perception a tendency to in|troduce
another, it is natural to think that this
tendency will be &s;tronge&s;t when the re&s;em|blance
is greate&s;t. Double&s;s this is generally
the ca&s;e: but it is far from holding univer|&s;ally;
there are &s;everal limitations and excep|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="231">
FOR example, Though the relation which
one object bears to another be very &s;trong,
yet if it be common, if it be &s;uch as that ob|ject
bears likewi&s;e to many other objects, it
will not operate &s;o &s;trongly on the imagina|tion,
as a weaker relation which is &s;pecial and
di&s;tingui&s;hing. Number di&s;tracts the atten|tion,
and hinders any one of the objects from
making a &s;triking impre&s;&s;ion. A nobleman
attracts le&s;s notice in a crowd of per&s;ons of his
own rank, than a man of much lower note,
would command in a company where he has
no equal. Singularity is always &s;triking.</P>
<P>AGAIN; If it be a&s;&s;erted that the &s;tronger
relation will prove the mo&s;t powerful princi|ple
of a&s;&s;ociation, the a&s;&s;ertion mu&s;t be con|fined
to one form or modification of that
relation. Of the various forms or modifica|tions
which, it has been &s;hown, every rela|tion
admits, &s;ome may be con&s;idered as
greater in degree than others: but different
men are chiefly affected by different modifi|cations
of a relation; and therefore &s;ome will
be mo&s;t affected by a weaker relation, becau&s;e
it is of that form from which they are mo&s;t
&s;u&s;ceptible of an impre&s;&s;ion. Indeed, &s;ome of
the peculiarities of genius nece&s;&s;arily imply a
propen&s;ity to be influenced mo&s;t by &s;ome of
<PB N="225" REF="232">
the weaker modifications of the a&s;&s;ociating
principles. Poetical genius, for example, &s;o
far as it depends on the force of the principle
of re&s;emblance, con&s;i&s;ts in a propen&s;ity to be
affected, not by the complete&s;t re&s;emblances,
but by &s;uch as are more imperfect. In poeti|cal
imagery, the re&s;emblance ought to be
always ju&s;t, but it is an excellence that it be
not altogether obvious, and it is nece&s;&s;ary
that it be mixt with &s;omething of diver&s;ity.
Any individual is likened, not &s;o often to
another individual of the &s;ame &s;pecies, as to
one of a different &s;pecies, or even to &s;ome|thing
totally different in kind: a hero is com|pared,
not &s;o frequently nor &s;o beautifully to
another hero, as to a lion or to the &s;un. The
exact &s;imilitudes to which the naturali&s;t con|fines
his attention, have no influence upon
the poet, and would be a very improper
foundation for metaphors or compari&s;ons.</P>
<P>BUT it is further ob&s;ervable, That &s;ome are
apt to be influenced even by a weak degree of
any modification of an a&s;&s;ociating quality,
rather than by a &s;tronger degree of the very
&s;ame modification. Thus &s;ome men, on
whatever &s;ubject they rea&s;on, deduce all their
rea&s;onings from remote principles, and never
prove any point by the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t di|rect
<PB N="226" REF="233">
arguments. There are writers, mo&s;t of
who&s;e images and antithe&s;es are far-fetched
and forced. This turn of imagination pro|duces
a peculiarity of genius, but generally
&s;uch an one as is faulty. A late ingenious
writer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, <HI>chap.</HI> 1.</NOTE> has remarked this peculiarity, that
&s;ome are apt to attend chiefly to remote and
trifling relations of ideas; and he gives a
very appo&s;ite example of it from Shake&s;pear;
<HI>Ho&s;te&s;s.</HI> Thou did&s;t &s;wear to me on a
parcel-gilt goblet, &s;itting in my Dolphin|chamber,
at the round table, by a &s;ea-coal
fire, on Wedne&s;day in Whit&s;un-week, when
the Prince broke thy head for likening him to
a &s;inging man of Wind&s;or; thou did&s;t &s;wear
to me then, as I was wa&s;hing thy wound, to
marry me, and make me my lady thy wife.
Can&s;t thou deny it? did not good-wi&s;e Keach
the butcher's wife come in then, and call me
go&s;&s;ip Quickly? coming in to borrow a me&s;s
of vinegar; telling us &s;he had a good di&s;h of
prawns, whereby thou did&s;t de&s;ire to eat &s;ome;
whereby I told thee they were ill for a green
wound; and did&s;t not thou, when &s;he was
gone down &s;tairs, de&s;ire me to be no more &s;o
familiarity with &s;uch poor people, &s;aying that
ere long they &s;hould call me Madam? and

thirty &s;hillings?&endq;<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Second part of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. act 2. &s;cene 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>That author accounts for this peculiarity, by
re&s;olving it into a want of di&s;cernment; but
this account is not altogether &s;atisfying. Sup|po&s;e
remote or &s;lightly connected ideas to have
occurred to a per&s;on, di&s;cernment may lead
him to reject them, and the want of it may
prevent his rejecting them. But the que&s;tion
remains, Whence comes it that &s;uch ideas
occur to &s;ome, and not to others? Their oc|curring
may in &s;ome mea&s;ure proceed indi|rectly
from a want of di&s;cernment: the judg|ment
of &s;ome men is &s;o &s;trong that it attends
imagination in all its exertions, and gives it
an habitual tendency to &s;ugge&s;t only &s;uch
ideas as have a proper connexion with the
pre&s;ent perception; a defect of judgment or
di&s;cernment prevents imagination from ac|quiring
this correctne&s;s, the want of which
leaves it at liberty to run into &s;light and re|mote
a&s;&s;ociations. But this is not the princi|pal
or immediate, far le&s;s the only cau&s;e of
it: its origin mu&s;t be &s;ought chiefly in the na|tural
turn of the imagination. If we attend
to the example ju&s;t now quoted, we &s;hall
find that all the tri&s;ling a&s;&s;ociations contained
<PB N="228" REF="235">
in it, con&s;i&s;t in the introduction of a number
of circum&s;tances which have no other con|nexion
with the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, but this,
that they happened in the place and at the
time to which it refers. The turn of imagi|nation
which it &s;hows, &s;eems therefore to
ari&s;e merely from vicinity being the prevail|ing
principle of a&s;&s;ociation. Mere vicinity
either in time or in place, is one of the &s;lighte&s;t
and lea&s;t important relations, and con&s;equently
whenever it is the prevailing relation, it will
produce a propen&s;ity to trifling a&s;&s;ociations<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>That the prevalence of this relation, is by far the mo&s;t common cau&s;e of trifling a&s;&s;ociations, may, I believe, be affirmed with con&s;idence. If we examine &s;everal in&s;tances of &s;uch trifling a&s;&s;ociations, we &s;hall find that they are generally formed by mere vicinity.

The predominance of the principle of re&s;em|blance,

whatever be the principle to which they be|long.
It de&s;erves to be remarked, however,
that a tendency to conceive ideas which are

&s;ometimes con&s;titutes an excellence
of genius. Some men &s;ee at one glance, the

<PB N="230" REF="237">
This proceeds from an uncommon activity of
imagination, which enables it to pa&s;s in an
in&s;tant through a long &s;eries of ideas, &s;o that
all the middle &s;teps are &s;carce attended to, and
very quickly forgotten.</P>
<P>THE peculiar form which genius a&s;&s;umes,
depends not on the predominant principle of
a&s;&s;ociation alone, but al&s;o on the degree of
force which all the other principles of a&s;&s;oci|ation
have. There is not any &s;ubject in which
invention depends upon, or can be accom|pli&s;hed
by only one of the&s;e principles. In
every &s;ubject, there is one <HI>leading</HI> principle of
invention; but many other principles, by be|ing
exerted in <HI>&s;ubordination</HI> to that, contribute
to the invention. Though one a&s;&s;ociating
principle be predominant in every man of
genius, yet all the other principles operate
along with it. The&s;e may be combined in
very different proportions; and every differ|ence
in the manner of their combination, or
in their comparative &s;trength, will produce as
real, though not &s;o remarkable a peculiarity
of genius, as a difference in the predominant
principle. In &s;uch genius, for in&s;tance, as
enables a man to account for the phenomena
of things, the relation of cau&s;e and effect is
the predominant principle of a&s;&s;ociation: but
<PB N="231" REF="238">
re&s;emblance al&s;o mu&s;t have &s;ome force, other|wi&s;e

are deducible, cannot be &s;ugge&s;ted; order
mu&s;t have &s;ome influence, for if the ob&s;erva|tions
be not properly di&s;po&s;ed, they will lead
to no conclu&s;ion: contrariety mu&s;t have &s;ome

genius with a peculiar character,
will adapt it to one particular &s;ort of &s;ubjects,
or will give it a determinate degree of excel|lence.
In genius of every kind, there is the
like complication and adju&s;tment of a&s;&s;ociating
principles. In every individual, genius is like
an organized body, the form of which ari&s;es
from the manner in which the &s;everal mem|bers
are combined, and is altered by every the
the &s;malle&s;t change in the &s;ize or po&s;ition of
any one of them. This being the ca&s;e, the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Flexibility of Imagination.</HEAD>
<P>WE have now pointed out &s;ome fixt and
permanent qualities of the imagina|tion,
which are &s;ufficient for the production
of a great variety of genius: but before we
leave this part of the &s;ubject, it will be pro|per
to ob&s;erve, that imagination has a certain
pliablene&s;s or flexibility, by means of which
&s;till greater variety is introduced.</P>
<P>ANY particular turn of imagination does
not lie in a mere point; it admits &s;ome lati|tude
without lo&s;ing its characteri&s;tical pecu|liarity.
The predominant principle of a&s;&s;oci|ation
may continue the &s;ame in the main, and
yet lead into tracks of thought con&s;iderably
different: the proportions which the &s;everal
principles of a&s;&s;ociation bear to one another,
may be altered without being wholly de&s;troy|ed;
ju&s;t as the con&s;iguration of the features
may be altered in a face by different pa&s;&s;ions
or different &s;tates of health, and yet that face
be acknowleged the &s;ame, and remain clearly
di&s;tingui&s;hable from every other. In con&s;e|quence
of this flexibility, the di&s;coveries of
the &s;ame per&s;on, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, will be
<PB N="233" REF="240">
very different at different times. If a per&s;on
write his thoughts on a &s;ubject at different
periods, the &s;entiments, the imagery, the com|po&s;ition,
the order, will be far from being the
very &s;ame. In &s;ome ca&s;es the difference is &s;o
great, as to &s;how that different a&s;&s;ociating
principles, at lea&s;t very different modifications
of the &s;ame principle, have been predominant
at the&s;e different periods.</P>
<P>A TEMPORARY variation in the turn of a
man's imagination, or in the form of his ge|nius,
&s;ometimes ari&s;es from cau&s;es as far be|yond
the reach of our inve&s;tigation, as many
of tho&s;e which produce an alteration in the
con&s;titution of the body, or of tho&s;e which
make one &s;ummer to differ from another.
But &s;uch variation may often be accounted
for from the influence which habit has upon
the operations of fancy.</P>
<P>HABIT di&s;po&s;es men to be ea&s;ily affected
by a relation which they have for &s;ome time
been accu&s;tomed to follow; and it often di&s;|po&s;es
them &s;o &s;trongly to this, as to make &s;ome
other a&s;&s;ociating principle to prevail for a
while, above that which is naturally predomi|nant.
To this effect of habit it is owing,
that a man, by applying for &s;ome time to a
&s;ubject which he could &s;carce force him&s;elf to
<PB N="234" REF="241">
&s;tudy at fir&s;t, comes to enter into it with ea&s;e.
From the &s;ame effect of habit, will ari&s;e a very
great degree of that diver&s;ity which has been
mentioned, in the productions of one man on
the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>HABIT may contribute to this diver&s;ity in
another way, and that even without making
any alteration in the predominant principle
of a&s;&s;ociation. Habit makes &s;uch ideas as are
at the time mo&s;t familiar to us, ru&s;h more
readily into the mind, than &s;uch as are le&s;s
familiar, though the&s;e latter be equally or
even more &s;trongly related to the pre&s;ent per|ception.
Many cau&s;es render different ideas
mo&s;t familiar to a per&s;on at different times:
and as a perception may be connected, by
means of any one a&s;&s;ociating quality, with a
thou&s;and others, that perception will naturally
&s;ugge&s;t any of the&s;e which is at pre&s;ent mo&s;t
familiar, provided it be connected with it by
the relation which has greate&s;t influence on
that particular per&s;on. Other ideas may be
more &s;trongly connected with it by the &s;ame
relation, and would be more readily &s;ugge&s;ted
to a per&s;on who was not under the power of
that habit; but with this per&s;on, the famili|arity
of the former idea gains it the prefer|ence
to all others. When on the fir&s;t concep|tion
<PB N="235" REF="242">
of a &s;ubject, certain ideas belonging to it
occur in this manner, by rea&s;on of their fami|liarity
to us, they lead us to &s;uch other ideas
as have the &s;tronge&s;t relation to them. But
if the ideas which were fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted, had
been different, they would have led us, by the
&s;ame principles, into a very different train of
thinking, and the whole work would have
born a very di&s;&s;imilar a&s;pect. Thus when a
per&s;on &s;ets out from a place where &s;everal
roads terminate, a very few &s;teps decide which
of them he takes; and by going on in it, he
arrives at a place very di&s;tant from that to
which he &s;hould have been brought by ano|ther
of the roads i&s;&s;uing from the &s;ame point.</P>
<P>THIS flexibility of imagination takes place
in all men, in &s;ome degree; but it takes place
in &s;ome men, in a much greater degree than
in others. No man has an imagination &s;o
dull, or an imagination &s;o invariably fixt in
one form, as to be nowi&s;e affected by habit or
other occa&s;ional cau&s;es: but there are two &s;orts
of per&s;ons, who are di&s;po&s;ed to be mo&s;t affected
by the&s;e. Fir&s;t, they who&s;e genius is not very
great, nor &s;trongly marked with any pecu|liarity.
It is on this account ea&s;ily turned
out of its direction by accidental cau&s;es, and
eagerly lays hold of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which may
<PB N="236" REF="243">
be derived from their operation. Secondly,
they who&s;e genius is uncommonly &s;trong and
lively. In the&s;e the &s;ame effect is produced
by a very different cau&s;e: the vigour and ac|tivity
of their a&s;&s;ociating powers, be&s;tows
great delicacy and &s;en&s;ibility upon their ima|ginations,
and renders them &s;u&s;ceptible of
&s;trong impre&s;&s;ions from any temporary cau&s;es;
they feel the force of every &s;uch cau&s;e, and
receive a tran&s;ient form or tincture from it.
The productions of the&s;e two different &s;orts
of per&s;ons, bear marks of the different cau&s;es
from which the flexibility of their fancies
&s;prings. The works of the former have no
common character, but are almo&s;t as unlike
to one another as to the works of a different
per&s;on; but through all the works of the lat|ter,
notwith&s;tanding their varieties, there runs
a certain peculiarity, which &s;hows that they
had the &s;ame author.</P>
<P>IT has been often ob&s;erved, that the dif|ferent
works of men of genius &s;ometimes dif|fer
very much in the degree of their perfec|tion.
This may &s;ometimes ari&s;e from the
&s;ubjects not being equally adapted to their abi|lities.
But in many ca&s;es it happens, that a
per&s;on will at one time very &s;ucce&s;sfully pro|&s;ecute
a &s;ubject which he has often attempted
<PB N="237" REF="244">
in vain before, or accompli&s;h a di&s;covery by
accident, which has eluded many profe&s;&s;ed in|ve&s;tigations.
This may frequently be ac|counted
for from the principles ju&s;t now e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.
Habit, or &s;ome other incidental cau&s;e,
gives the fancy at one time a turn, which we
do not reflect upon, but which prepares it for
attaining a certain di&s;covery; and that either
by rendering an idea familiar, which is &s;ub|&s;ervient
to that di&s;covery, or by di&s;po&s;ing it
to follow the relation which leads mo&s;t natu|rally
to the di&s;covery. At another time, the
&s;ame cau&s;e gives the mind &s;o &s;trong a propen|&s;ity
to attend to an idea, or to follow a rela|tion
which draws us off from the proper track,
and ob&s;tructs the invention, that no efforts
can conquer it. When the appearance ari&s;es
not from this cau&s;e, it may often be a&s;cribed
to the inequalities which are incident to the
vigour of genius in the &s;ame man at different
times, and which may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure
accounted for from the ob&s;ervations that have
been formerly made. Though the principles
of a&s;&s;ociation be never perhaps entirely dor|mant
or impotent, yet they are not, in any
any man, alike prone to exert them&s;elves, or
fit for acting with the &s;ame force, at all &s;ea&s;ons.
Sometimes they are active, and ready to run
<PB N="238" REF="245">
from any idea that occurs, through a long
train of other ideas related to it, without a
po&s;&s;ibility of our re&s;i&s;ting their influence, or
cooling the ardour which their activity in|&s;pires.
When the imagination is in this &s;tate,
and is at the &s;ame time impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;trong
view of a particular end, genius is exten&s;ive
and vigorous, and can with ea&s;e perfect in|ventions,
as by a lucky and unaccountable hit,
in pur&s;uing which it has formerly toiled in
vain. To produce this vigour and alertne&s;s
of invention, it is nece&s;&s;ary that there be &s;ome
pre&s;ent perception connected with many
others, from which it may &s;et out; that the
a&s;&s;ociating principle to which that connexion
corre&s;ponds, be &s;trong; that the mind be not
deeply engaged in any other train of thinking
which would lead off from this track; and
that we have a &s;trong a&s;&s;ociation of the de|&s;ign.
If any of the&s;e conditions be wanting,
that alertne&s;s will be ob&s;tructed. It &s;ome|times
is ob&s;tructed to a very great degree;
fancy is depre&s;&s;ed, the power of a&s;&s;ociation
&s;eems to be &s;u&s;pended, or if it at all exert it|&s;elf,
it is only in trifling, unmeaning excur|&s;ions;
it is too feeble to keep the de&s;ign in
view, and is continually allowing us to quit
the road which would lead us forward to a
<PB N="239" REF="246">
valuable invention. While this debility of
imagination continues, it throws genius into
a &s;tate of languor. It enters on its work with|out
&s;ufficient ardour; it is &s;luggi&s;h, and can
make no progre&s;s in it; it &s;ugge&s;ts no ideas,
or but few that are conducive to its intention;
and all our efforts to exert it are un&s;ucce&s;sful.
We cannot call up ideas, as it were, by name,
we can only ca&s;t our&s;elves into the roads in
which they are likelie&s;t to occur; and if fancy
be not powerful enough to bring them into
view, we mu&s;t remain without them. This
accounts, in a great mea&s;ure, for the common
ob&s;ervation, that mo&s;t u&s;eful inventions have
been made by accident, often when men were
in &s;earch of &s;omething el&s;e. This &s;hows us
likewi&s;e, why the greate&s;t geniu&s;es &s;ometimes
&s;ink below them&s;elves, and fail in undertak|ings
in which at another time they would
have ea&s;ily &s;ucceeded. It is as impo&s;&s;ible,
during the&s;e unfavourable turns of genius, to
&s;upply its defects by application, as it is for
application to produce genius in tho&s;e who
naturally want it. The force and &s;plendour
of imagination throw a lu&s;tre on the pro|ductions
of real genius, which renders them
ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable from the lifele&s;s and
in&s;ipid productions of unanimated indu&s;try.
<PB N="240" REF="247">
Diligence and acquired abilities may a&s;&s;i&s;t or
improve genius, but it is only a vigorous ima|gination
that can produce it. Whenever mere
labour is &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of this, it
can but mimic genius: the work will always
bear evident traces of unnatural force and auk|ward
&s;training.</P>
<P>THE flexibility of the human imagination
appears not only in a per&s;on's attempts on
the &s;ame &s;ubject: in &s;ome men's efforts on
different &s;ubjects, it appears very remarkably.
There are men in whom one a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciple
&s;eems to be predominant when they are
engaged in &s;ome &s;ubjects, and a totally differ|ent
principle when they apply to &s;ubjects of
another kind. Whatever be their pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject,
their minds adapt them&s;elves in an in|&s;tant
to it, and are prepared to yield them|&s;elves
wholly up to tho&s;e relations which be|long
to that &s;ubject, and by means of which
di&s;coveries may be made in it. It is not ea&s;y
to explain all the cau&s;es from which this &s;ort
of flexibility ari&s;es; perhaps it is in &s;ome
mea&s;ure unaccountable: but there is one cau&s;e
to which it is often owing. Every work in
which genius can be employed, has a parti|cular
de&s;ign or end. True genius always fits
a man for forming a lively and permanent
<PB N="241" REF="248">
conception of the de&s;ign, &s;uch a conception
of it as may make all his thoughts to move
in &s;ub&s;ervience to it. An uncommon vigour
and delicacy of the a&s;&s;ociating principles will
enable a man to conceive many di&s;&s;imilar de|&s;igns,
with all the vivacity which is requi&s;ite
for making any one of them dwell on the
imagination. Its nature gives a temporary
bent to the mind. It infu&s;es great activity
into tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociating principles, by our fol|lowing
of which it may be promoted. The&s;e
principles are not, perhaps, naturally predo|minant
in the per&s;on; the perception of a
different de&s;ign would have rendered a quite
different principle predominant: but the&s;e
have naturally &s;o great a degree of &s;trength,
that, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they receive from
the de&s;ign, they can be made to prevail, and
to regulate, for &s;ome time, all the exertions
of the imagination. In &s;ome men, a capacity
of being &s;trongly affected with the view of
any particular de&s;ign, and a pliancy of fancy
con&s;equent on this, are &s;o great, that their ge|nius
&s;eems to be almo&s;t equally adapted to the
mo&s;t oppo&s;ite &s;ubjects. There have been per|&s;ons
who were at once inventors in matters of
&s;cience, and originals in the arts. In mimics
this pliancy of fancy appears in a very great
<PB N="242" REF="249">
degree, though it be employed in an inferiour
province. Wherever it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, a per|&s;on's
thoughts are wholly moulded by the pre|&s;ent
de&s;ign; he lo&s;es &s;ight of him&s;elf, and is
perfectly transformed into the character which
he wants to a&s;&s;ume. Thus as a fitne&s;s for
being &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed by a de&s;ign, be&s;tows
regularity on genius, &s;o a capacity of being
equally impre&s;&s;ed by di&s;&s;imilar de&s;igns, gives
a great variety and compa&s;s to the genius of a
particular per&s;on.</P>
<P>WE have now endeavoured to di&s;cover the
&s;ources of the varieties of genius, &s;o far as
they lie in the peculiarities of the imagina|tion.
If none of the a&s;&s;ociating principles be
&s;trong, there can be no genius. If one be re|markably
vigorous in compari&s;on with the
re&s;t, genius will be fixt to one &s;ort of &s;ubjects
&s;uited to that principle. If all of them be
very vigorous, the perception of a particular
de&s;ign will have force enough to give any one
of them a temporary prevalence; and by this
means genius will have great compa&s;s, its ex|ertions
will be &s;u&s;ceptible of great variety. In
proportion to the degree of variety of which
genius is thus &s;u&s;ceptible, it will approach the
nearer to univer&s;ality.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="250">
BUT though the varieties which belong to
imagination, evidently produce many diver|&s;ities
of genius, we &s;hall never be able to ac|count
for all its diver&s;ities by attending only
to the imagination; for imagination alone is
not &s;ufficient for compleating any work of ge|nius.
In all its perfect exertions; it derives
aid from other faculties, the varieties of which
mu&s;t contribute &s;omewhat to the &s;everal forms
which it a&s;&s;umes. The faculties from which
imagination receives a&s;&s;i&s;tance, are &s;en&s;e, me|mory,
and judgment. An enquiry into the
varieties of which the fir&s;t of the&s;e is capable,
would give us little light: the varieties inci|dent
to the two la&s;t, it will be of importance
to examine. The varieties of memory bear
the neare&s;t analogy to tho&s;e of imagination,
and for that rea&s;on it will be natural fir&s;t to
explain them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Varieties of Memory, and their Influence
on Genius.</HEAD>
<P>MEMORY is employed either in retain|ing
&s;ingle perceptions, or in pre&s;erv|ing
the order and connexion of different
perceptions. It is &s;u&s;ceptible of con&s;iderable
varieties in re&s;pect of both the&s;e exertions.
<PB N="244" REF="251">
EVERY perception retained by memory, de|cays
by length of time. As di&s;tant objects
look fainter and &s;maller to the eye, and as
di&s;tant &s;ounds &s;trike the ear more feebly, than
&s;uch as are near; &s;o the remembrance of things
pa&s;t grows weaker in proportion to the time
which has elap&s;ed &s;ince they were pre&s;ent;
and at la&s;t every trace of them is obliterated.
But &s;ome perceptions decay much more &s;lowly
than others. While one perception is for|gotten
as &s;oon as it is received, the remem|brance
of another is firm and permanent for
many years. The general principles on which
the permanence of remembrance depends, are
very &s;imple.</P>
<P>IT may be e&s;tabli&s;hed as a principle, that
tho&s;e perceptions are mo&s;t firmly and perma|nently
remembered, which were &s;tronge&s;t at
fir&s;t. A &s;trong perception, like a deep &s;hade
of colouring, &s;eems to decay more &s;lowly than
one that is faint and delicate; and though it
&s;hould decay as fa&s;t, it would be longer be|fore
it were effaced. The particular ca&s;es
reducible to this general principle, are very
numerous; and they are all experiments
&s;erving to confirm it. They are chiefly the
following.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="252">
THE perceptions of &s;en&s;e are always &s;tronger
than any ideas which we can form; and ac|cordingly
what we have perceived by our
&s;en&s;es, is better remembered than what we
have only heard or read of. The percep|tions
of &s;ome of the &s;en&s;es, are &s;tronger and
more &s;triking than tho&s;e of other &s;en&s;es; and
in con&s;equence of that they fix them&s;elves
more durably in the memory. Of all our
perceptions, plea&s;ure and pain are tho&s;e which
affect us mo&s;t deeply; and the objects which
produce them, lay fa&s;te&s;t hold of the memory:
we often hear men give it as a rea&s;on for their
never being able to forget one thing, that it
affected them much; and give it as a rea&s;on
for their having no remembrance of another
thing, that it did not at all intere&s;t them.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Siquas res in vita videmus parvas, u&s;itatas, quotidiana$, eas memini&s;&s;e non &s;olemus: propterea quod nulla ni&s;i nova, aut admirabili re commovetur animus.

<P>SOME degree of attention is nece&s;&s;ary for
our perceiving objects at all; &s;ounds often
&s;trike the ear without being heard, things are
often full in our view without being &s;een;
the whole attention of the &s;oul is otherwi&s;e
engaged. By be&s;towing attention, the mind
as it were embraces the objects exhibited to it,
<PB N="246" REF="253">
and lays it&s;elf open to a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion
from them, which makes them both affect it
much while they are pre&s;ent, and keep firm
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the memory afterwards. The
length of time for which attention is be&s;towed,
as well as the clo&s;ene&s;s of the attention, ren|ders
our perception of an object the &s;tronger;
and it renders the remembrance of it propor|tionably
the more la&s;ting<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Nec dubium e&s;t, quin plurimum in hac parte valeat mentis intentio, et velut acies luminum a pro&s;pectu rerum quas intuetur, non aver&s;a.

by returning often to the contemplation
of an object, we learn to conceive it vigorou&s;ly,
and the remembrance of it becomes clear and
permanent: a perception which has &s;eldom
affected the &s;en&s;es, is quickly obliterated from
the memory; light and colours are totally
forgotten by tho&s;e who have early lo&s;t their
&s;ight: but &s;uch perceptions as are repeated
every day, never quit their hold of the me|mory;
by the attention be&s;towed upon them
as often as they recur, they are pre&s;erved in
their original &s;trength, without finding time
even to begin to decay.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved, that every thing is well
remembered, which is impre&s;&s;ed on the mind
<PB N="247" REF="254">
when free and di&s;engaged<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Plurimum conferre&mdash;animum cogitationibus aliis liberum. QUINT. <HI>In&s;t. Orat.</HI> lib. xi. cap. 2.</NOTE>. This is one
of the circum&s;tances which render the morn|ing
favourable to &s;tudy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>. On this account
we retain through life, what we learn in child|hood
and early youth<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Quae acciderunt in pueritia, meminimus optime &s;aepe. <HI>Ad Heren.</HI> lib. iii.</NOTE>. When the mind is
already occupied by one object, an effort is
nece&s;&s;ary to draw it off from that object; this
effort weakens the application with which we
attend to the &s;ucceeding object: the former
object &s;till attracts &s;ome part of our attention,
and thus farther weakens our conception of
the other. But a di&s;engaged mind be&s;tows
its whole attention on the object that is pre|&s;ented
to it, and conceives it with great viva|city.
Thus al&s;o, a thing is well remembered,
when the mind is, for &s;ome time after having
perceived it, occupied by no new object<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Aliae in&s;tantiae dabunt hanc alteram &s;pe$ciem; ut quae maxime imprimuntur a mente pura, et minus praeoceupata ante vel po&s;t; veluti quae di&s;cuntur in pueritia, aut quae com|mentamur ante &s;omnum, etiam primae quaeque reruin vices; magis haereant in memoria.

in this ca&s;e there is room for continued, as
well as clo&s;e, attention, which &s;trengthens
the impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;en&s;es, and, in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="248" REF="255">
of that, upon the memory. Pre-ex|pectation
likewi&s;e renders the remembrance
of an object durable: it rou&s;es the attention,

be&s;towing attention, it invigorates our con|ception

as they can.</P>
<P>ONCE more, we remember that be&s;t, which
we under&s;tand mo&s;t perfectly. What we un|der&s;tand,
&s;trikes us with its whole force: of
what we under&s;tand imperfectly, it is only
the part under&s;tood, that makes any impre&s;|&s;ion
on us; of the re&s;t we have no perception;
even that part makes but a faint impre&s;&s;ion;
it would acquire additional force from its
connexion with the other parts, if the whole
were under&s;tood.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e in&s;tances it appears, that per|ceptions
originally &s;trong, are mo&s;t firmly
remembered.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="256">
MEMORY pre&s;erves the order and con|nexion
of perceptions, as well as the percep|tions
them&s;elves. If it did not, we could re|tain
only &s;imple perceptions. Every complex
object con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal parts united together
in a certain manner; memory retains not
only all the parts, but al&s;o the manner in
which they are united. It retains the latter
&s;o firmly, that we do not naturally attend to
the di&s;tinction of the parts which compo&s;e a
whole. It is almo&s;t only the philo&s;opher that
thinks of enumerating them; and in order to
enumerate them, he mu&s;t &s;et him&s;elf pur|po&s;ely
to analy&s;e and decompound his idea of
the whole. Different wholes are connected
in nature by various relations; the&s;e relations
are ob&s;erved when the things are exhibited to
our &s;en&s;es; and the real ob&s;erved relations of
things are retained by the memory. As it is
by co-exi&s;tence, that the parts of the &s;ame
whole are united, &s;o it is by vicinity, cau&s;a|tion,
and order, that different wholes are con|nected
in nature, and, in con&s;equence of the
ob&s;ervation of this, afterwards tied together
in the memory.</P>
<P>IN every ca&s;e of &s;trong and exact remem|brance,
we have a clear perception of the
connexions of things, as well as of the things
<PB N="250" REF="257">
them&s;elves. Things which are in the memory
together, do not lie in confu&s;ion, but form
di&s;tinct images, and are beheld in their ju&s;t
proportions. It is this property of memory,
that enables imagination to introduce into its
works, entire &s;cenes of real hi&s;tory, or large
parts of nature, which we have actually ob|&s;erved.
The introduction of the&s;e not only
a&s;&s;i&s;ts the operation of imagination, and le&s;|&s;ens
its labour, but likewi&s;e contributes to the
excellence of its productions. Shake&s;peare's
de&s;cription of Dover cliff, may &s;erve as an
example of the advantage to which genius
can turn this exerci&s;e of memory;

Many de&s;criptions and relations which are
introduced into poetry, as if they were the
creation of fancy, are really copied from me|mory.
To have recour&s;e, in this manner, to
memory, contributes greatly to be&s;tow rich|ne&s;s
and variety on the works of genius: for
no imagination has force enough to diver&s;ity
&s;cenes &s;eigned by it&s;elf, in &s;o great a degree
as objects and events are diver&s;ified in nature.
Some painters, in&s;tead of imitating nature,
draw almo&s;t all their figures from a general
idea which they have formed to them&s;elves.
The con&s;equence is, that a &s;amene&s;s runs
through all their works; they repre&s;ent not
that endle&s;s variety which attention to nature
would have &s;ugge&s;ted to them. Anthony
Tempe&s;ta and Peter Te&s;ta are taken notice of
as faulty in this way. On the other hand, it
is ob&s;erved that attention to the real varieties
of nature, has introduced great variety into
the works of Salvator Ro&s;a, except in one
particular, the legs of his figures, which are
copied not from nature, but from an idea of
his own, and which for this rea&s;on, though
well drawn, are too &s;imilar.</P>
<P>THUS memory, by retaining the real con|nexions
of things, gives us a di&s;tinct and en|tire
perception of the&s;e things, when they are
<PB N="252" REF="259">
all actually pre&s;ent to our view. But it mu&s;t
be remarked further, That when one of the
things only is in view, the re&s;t may be brought
to our remembrance, by means of their con|nexion
with it, pre&s;erved by memory. When
we think of one part of a machine, it &s;ugge&s;ts
the other parts, and the form of the whole,
When we think of one object in a complex
&s;cene, it bring the re&s;t into our view. When
memory pre&s;ents one event, this leads us to
think of the other events which were con|nected
with it, and to conceive them in their
proper order. The remembrance of many
periods of a di&s;cour&s;e or of a great number of
ver&s;es, is often revived by the &s;ingle word
with which they begin<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Nam etiam excidentes, unius admonitione verbi in me|moriam repountur. QUINT. <HI>In&s;t. Orat.</HI> lib. xi. cap. 2.</NOTE>. Thus ideas are in|troduced
by others with which they are con|nected
in the memory, in the very &s;ame man|ner
as it has been already &s;hown that they are
introduced by tho&s;e with which they are a&s;&s;o|ciated
in the imagination. It is ob&s;ervable
too that the connexions retained by memory,
are the &s;ame with &s;ome of the relations by
which ideas are a&s;&s;ociated in the imagination.
On the&s;e accounts, the exertions of the&s;e two
faculties are often very analogous, and &s;ome|times
<PB N="253" REF="260">
times not di&s;tingui&s;hable except by the per&s;on
him&s;elf. When things are connected in the
mind by vicinity, co-exi&s;tence, cau&s;ation, or
order, in the manner in which we have actu|ally
ob&s;erved them, and when at the &s;ame
time we have a conviction of our having ob|&s;erved
them thus connected, the exhibition
not only of the things them&s;elves, but al&s;o of
their connexions, is properly a&s;cribed to me|mory.
When the&s;e relations are be&s;towed
upon things to which they may belong, but
which we have never actually ob&s;erved united
by them; when at lea&s;t we have forgotten
that we had ob&s;erved the things placed in the&s;e
relations; or when we join things together,
not by the&s;e relations, but on account of their
re&s;emblance or their contrariety; in all the&s;e
ca&s;es, things are properly &s;aid to be a&s;&s;ociated
in the imagination, not conjoined in the me|mory.
For example, when a per&s;on gives a
minute de&s;cription of a country which he has
lately &s;een, or relates a &s;eries of events which
he has witne&s;&s;ed or learned from hi&s;tory, the
whole is owing to the exerci&s;e of memory;
imagination has no &s;hare in it. If he illu&s;|trate
any part of his recital by a compari&s;on
with re&s;embling objects, or enliven it by con|tracts;
or if he have forgotten part of the ob|jects,
<PB N="254" REF="261">
and &s;upply the defect which this would
occa&s;ion in his &s;tory, by putting in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances
as are con&s;i&s;tent with the other
parts; then he exerci&s;es imagination as really,
though not in &s;o great a degree, as he who
contrives any of the imaginary trains of events
or &s;cenes of action, which are common with
poets and writers of romance.</P>
<P>As the exertions of memory retaining the
connexions of things, and the exertions of
imagination, are thus analogous, &s;o it is far|ther
ob&s;ervable, that they are almo&s;t always
nece&s;&s;arily intermingled. Sometimes imagi|nation
takes the lead, and memory acts in
&s;ubordination to it: how far, and in what
ways, was explained formerly<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Part I. &s;ect. 5.</NOTE>. Let us
now take notice, in what manner imagination
is exerci&s;ed when it acts in &s;ubordination to
memory. In exhibition any one thing which
we have ob&s;erved, or a number of things in
their ob&s;erved order, memory alone is ex|erted.
But from the&s;e we often pa&s;s to other
things, connected with them not by an order
really ob&s;erved, but by &s;ome other ties: in
this ca&s;e the tran&s;ition is made by the imagi|nation.
The things to which this tran&s;ition
is made, are di&s;tinctly remembered; and
<PB N="255" REF="262">
while we dwell on them, memory is the only
faculty employed in conceiving them. It is
when we leave the&s;e, and pa&s;s to others not
connected with them in our experience, that
imagination is again exerted. We never can
have a long train of thoughts, or carry on a
long conver&s;ation, even relating to the mere&s;t
matters of fact, wholly by the &s;ugge&s;tions of
memory, without any aid from imagination.
If this faculty did not interpo&s;e, and give us
a new impul&s;e, our thoughts would quickly
&s;tagnate, our conver&s;ation would fail, we
&s;hould be &s;trictly confined to one &s;ubject, at
lea&s;t to &s;uch groupes of objects and &s;uch &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
events, as we have ob&s;erved really con|joined
in nature. Thus, as it was formerly
&s;hown on the one hand, that memory a&s;&s;i&s;ts
imagination in all works of genius, &s;o on the
other hand memory receives great a&s;&s;i&s;tance
from imagination, in mo&s;t of its operations.
What has been &s;aid on this point, will enable
us in &s;ome mea&s;ure to conceive, how imagi|nation,
and con&s;equently genius, enters into
a &s;pecies of compo&s;ition from which many
have totally excluded it, the writing of hi&s;|tory.
By what has been &s;aid, we are led
likewi&s;e to make a remark which regards ge|nius
of every kind, That our remembrance
<PB N="256" REF="263">
of the real connexions of things, multiplies
the ties by which ideas are united in our
minds; and con&s;equently multiplies both the
roads by which we may be led to the concep|tion
of &s;uch ideas as we have occa&s;ion for,
and the combinations into which the relations
of ideas may be formed: and how much the&s;e
circum&s;tances contribute both to the compa&s;s
and to the variety of genius, has been &s;uffici|ently
explained already.</P>
<P>THE fitne&s;s which both the connexions of
things retained by memory and their relations
in the imagination, have for cau&s;ing one bring
others into our view, contributes much to the
&s;trength and perfection of remembrance.
Without this, the exerci&s;e of memory would
be much more difficult than it is: for our re|membering
any &s;eries of thoughts, it would
be nece&s;&s;ary to impre&s;s them <HI>all</HI> vigorou&s;ly on
the mind; if any of them were faint, it would
nece&s;&s;arily be forgotten. But becau&s;e one
idea introduces others connected with it, we
may &s;ometimes remember many, by gaining
a &s;trong perception of a few: the relation of
the many to the few, will be &s;ufficient for
calling them to mind, though they them&s;elves
be but weakly remembered.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="264">
NAY farther; one perception may become
&s;trong by being connected with another. This
ob&s;ervation is nece&s;&s;ary for giving the ju&s;t
extent to a principle formerly laid down,
That the firmne&s;s with which &s;eparate objects
are remembered, is in proportion to the
&s;trength of our original perceptions of the&s;e
objects. This principle will appear liable to
many exceptions, if it be not remarked, that
though a perception was not it&s;elf &s;trong at
fir&s;t, yet if it was connected with a &s;trong
perception, it is well remembered by means
of that connexion. A &s;trong perception com|municates
&s;trength to other perceptions con|nected
with it; and in con&s;equence of this
communication, they imprint them&s;elves as
deeply on the memory as if they had had in|herent
&s;trength. Be&s;ides, the &s;trong percep|tion
will frequently recur to our view; and
as often as it occurs, it will readily &s;ugge&s;t
&s;uch as are connected with it; it will commu|nicate
&s;trength to them, and make them to
be conceived with force and vivacity. On
this account al&s;o, if the idea of an object
comes, at any of its appearances in the me|mory,
to be connected with another that is
&s;trong, it will derive &s;trength from this latter,
and in con&s;equence of this be vigorou&s;ly re|membered,
<PB N="258" REF="265">
though the objects had no con|nexion
when they were originally perceived
by the &s;en&s;es. The truth of the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions
appears in many in&s;tances. It was to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the introduction of ideas by the force of
&s;en&s;ible &s;igns, that the ancient orators u&s;ed
images in the artificial memory<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Vidit autem hoc prudenter &s;ive Simonides, five alius quis invenit, $a maxime animis e&s;&s;ingi no&s;tris, quae e&s;&s;ent a &s;en&s;u tradita, atque impre&s;&s;a: acerrimum autem ex omnibus no&s;tris &s;en&s;ibus e&s;&s;e &s;en&s;um videndi: quare facillime animo teneri po&s;&s;e ea, quae perciperentur auribus, aut cogitatione, fi etiam oculorum commendatione animis traderentur, ut res caecas, et ab ad&s;pectus judicio remotas, conformatio quaedam, et imago, et figura ita notaret, ut ea quae cogitando complecti non po&s;&s;emus, intuendo qua&s;i teneremus.

VERULAM. <HI>Nov. Org.</HI> Ibid. See al&s;o, <HI>De Augm. Scientiarum,</HI> lib. v. cap. 5.</NOTE>. We
often hear per&s;ons a&s;&s;ign as a rea&s;on for their
retaining a thing &s;trongly, &s;ome affecting pe|culiarity
in their circum&s;tances when they
fir&s;t became acquainted with it, which has
united it&s;elf in&s;eparably to it, and rendered
it impo&s;&s;ible for them to forget it. We &s;ome|times
want a per&s;on to recollect a particular
occurrence; we affirm again and again that
he was pre&s;ent at it; but he can remember
nothing of it: we mention &s;omething which
happened at the &s;ame time, or was otherwi&s;e
connected with it; he remembers this di&s;|tinctly;
<PB N="259" REF="266">
the remembrance of it revives his
remembrance of that occurrence, be&s;tows vi|vacity
upon it, and renders it clearly percep|tible.
If we have a high &s;en&s;e of the impor|tance
of any &s;ubject, that &s;en&s;e makes every
thing related to this &s;ubject, to be &s;trongly
remembered. The rea&s;on and the efficacy of
puni&s;hments depend very much on the prin|ciple
now under con&s;ideration; the remem|brance
of the pain or &s;hame pre&s;erves the re|membrance
of the fault, and by con&s;tantly
attending it, produces con&s;tant aver&s;ion to
the repetition of the fault, and care to avoid
it. We do not ea&s;ily forget any thing related
to a per&s;on whom we love. What excites
de&s;ire, admiration, joy, fear, &s;orrow, or in
general any &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, is firmly remem|bered;
the pa&s;&s;ion communicates force both
to the &s;en&s;ation and to the idea of the object
by which it was excited<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Aliae in&s;tantiae dabunt hane alteram &s;peciem; ut quae faciunt impre&s;&s;ionem in affectu forti, incutientes &s;eilicet me|rum, admirationem, pudorem, delectationem, juvent memo|riam. VERULAM. <HI>Nov. Org.</HI> Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE are not always wholly pa&s;&s;ive in the
exerci&s;e of memory; we can make efforts to
remember what does not ca&s;t up to us readily
and of its own accord. This voluntary exer|tion
of memory, is called <HI>recollection.</HI> As
<PB N="260" REF="267">
rememberance is a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the relations of
things, &s;o recollection is altogether owing to
them. It would be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, if
there were not &s;uch a connexion among our
ideas, as enables one of them when excited,
to bring another into view. We cannot call
up an idea <HI>directly</HI> by an act of the will.
We cannot will to rai&s;e that particular idea
which we want; for this would imply that
we conceived it already, and needed not to
rai&s;e it by a volition: and if we have not al|ready
conceived it, we will to rai&s;e we know
not what idea. It is only <HI>indirectly</HI> that we
rai&s;e an idea by a volition. The idea which
we want, has &s;ome relations to certain others;
the&s;e others, with the relations which they
bear to that, may be in our view; we can
voluntarily &s;et out from the&s;e, and pur&s;ue the
&s;everal relations which belong to them, till
we fall upon that relation which leads to the
idea wanted. The lea&s;t reflection on what
pa&s;&s;es in our own minds, will convince us
that this is the very way which we take in
recollecting. We are ju&s;t like per&s;ons in
&s;earch of &s;omething which they have lo&s;t,
they know not preci&s;ely where: but by their
knowing the place where they fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ed it,
by their recollecting when they la&s;t had it, by
<PB N="261" REF="268">
their remembering all the places they have
been in &s;ince, and by their thinking what
might be the occa&s;ion of their lo&s;ing it, their
&s;earch is reduced within &s;ome bounds, and
they have &s;ome direction in it, whereas other|wi&s;e
they had been obliged to &s;eek for it at
perfect random. In the &s;ame manner, in
con&s;equence of the connexion which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts
among different ideas, we may have a &s;ort of
anticipation of one which is not yet pre&s;ent
to the mind, a notion of &s;ome relation which
it bears to another that is pre&s;ent; and by
that notion we are in the proper track for
finding it, and following this track are quick|ly
led to it. Hence ver&s;es are not only more
ea&s;ily committed to memory, than pro&s;e, but
al&s;o more readily recollected: when we are
at a lo&s;s about a word, we know before-hand
that it mu&s;t be &s;uch as will agree not only
with the &s;en&s;e but al&s;o with the mea&s;ure.
Hence order and a regular di&s;tribution is a
great a&s;&s;i&s;tance in recollecting a di&s;cour&s;e: if
a particular period occur not readily, we know
at lea&s;t that it mu&s;t be &s;uch as &s;uits a certain

As an idea is recollected only by our follow|ing
<PB N="263" REF="270">
&s;ome relation which we know that it
bears to another, it is evident that its bearing
&s;everal different relations to that other, will
facilitate our recollection of it. Any one of
the&s;e relations may conduct us to it; and we
may light upon one of them when we have
mi&s;&s;ed another. We often remember a di&s;|cour&s;e,
when we have forgotten the &s;peaker;
if we retain but a few circum&s;tances of the
time and place, the&s;e may lead us equally to
&s;everal per&s;ons, among whom we cannot di&s;|tingui&s;h
the real &s;peaker: but if we retain a
great number of circum&s;tances, as the tone
of voice and the manner in which it was told,
the number, &s;ituation, and other circum&s;tan|ces
of the company, &s;ome or other of the&s;e
will lead us to a&s;certain the very &s;peaker.
All the circum&s;tances together will lead us to
recollect the idea which we want, both more
quickly and more &s;trongly than one or a few
of them could have done; they will draw it
into the mind with a &s;ort of impetuo&s;ity,
which at once accelerates its motion, and ena|bles
it to &s;trike us with greater force: for in

in a regular train, &s;ubject this train, at

<P><PB N="265" REF="272">
THE voluntary exertion of the memory in
recollection, is very analogous to the exerci&s;e
of imagination in producing a work of genius;
for in this exerci&s;e, as well as in that exer|tion,
the will has always &s;ome concern: it de|termines
the &s;ubject, and it is continually em|ployed
in choo&s;ing the proper tracts of thought.
If it were not employed in this, genius mu&s;t
go on like a mere machine, and a per&s;on
&s;hould have no power over it after it were
once &s;et in motion. In what manner the will
mixes it&s;elf with the operations of the ima|gination,
and influences them, may be under|&s;tood
from the account of recollection, which
we have now given. Recollection, and the
voluntary exerci&s;e of imagination, differ chiefly
in two things. Fir&s;t, in the end propo&s;ed.
We properly recollect, when all that we
de&s;ire, is to recal to memory &s;omething
which we have ob&s;erved; and in recalling
it, we are often a&s;&s;i&s;ted by fancy; for we may
be led to it, not only by its ob&s;erved con|nexions
with other things, but al&s;o by any
relations to them, which imagination has be|&s;towed.
We voluntarily exert imagination,
when our intention is, merely to gather toge|ther
&s;uch ideas as &s;uit our pre&s;ent work; and
in gathering them together, real connexions
<PB N="266" REF="273">
pre&s;erved by memory, are often of great &s;er|vice
to us. Secondly, when we properly re|collect
ideas, they are no &s;ooner brought into
our view, than we have a conviction that ei|ther
they them&s;elves, or the objects from which
they are derived, have been formerly perceived
by us; and that conviction is attended to by
the mind: when the ideas are brought into
view by the imagination, either we have no
&s;uch conviction, or we take no notice of it.
The&s;e two, recollection and the exerci&s;e of
imagination, are conjoined in producing every
work of genius, but not equally in works of
all kinds, nor in the genius of all per&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE ob&s;ervations which we have hitherto
made, regard the different operations in which
memory is exerted; and they &s;how the influ|ence
which the&s;e &s;everal operations have upon
genius. But there are likewi&s;e differences of
another &s;ort incident to memory, &s;uch as affect
all its operations, and produce varieties in its
form and power. All the&s;e differences may
be explained from the principles already laid
down, either from tho&s;e which regard &s;eparate
thoughts, or from tho&s;e which regard their
connexions, or from both together. By con|&s;idering
the mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e differ|ences,
tho&s;e principles will be farther con|firmed
<PB N="267" REF="274">
and illu&s;trated, and &s;ome additional
ob&s;ervations concerning genius, will be &s;ug|ge&s;ted.</P>
<P>THE memory of the &s;ame per&s;on is not
equally perfect in all the periods of his life.
Memory is weak in very young children,
and in very old men; but the weakne&s;s pro|ceeds
from di&s;&s;imilar cau&s;es. The former are
not capable either of be&s;towing &s;o clo&s;e atten|tion
upon things, or of comprehending them
&s;o perfectly, as would be nece&s;&s;ary for their
making a &s;trong or la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the
memory. In the latter, all the powers of per|ception
are become dull, nothing can &s;trike
them &s;o deeply as to infix it&s;elf in the me|mory.
That this is the real cau&s;e of the de|cay
of memory by age, is evident from the
common remark, that old per&s;ons forget what
happened ye&s;terday, but remember di&s;tinctly
what occurred many years ago: could re|cent
events affect their deadened organs with
equal force, their remembrance of them would
be equally tenacious<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>. In the former part
of youth, memory is very firm: many cau&s;es
then concur to make all our perceptions &s;trong,
and con&s;equently durable; the mind is not
<PB N="268" REF="275">
pre-occupied; the &s;pirits are lively; curio&s;ity
is high; every thing being new, &s;trikes with
its full force; admiration is ea&s;ily rai&s;ed, and
all the pa&s;&s;ions &s;trong, and fit for communi|cating
vigour to the perceptions which occa|&s;ion
them. In the age of maturity, many of
the&s;e cau&s;es of &s;trong remembrance cea&s;e: but
their place is in a con&s;iderable degree &s;upplied
by others; things are more perfectly under|&s;tood;
the connexions of perceptions are more
fully perceived; and memory is improved by
habit. It is in youth and maturity, that ge|nius
exerts it&s;elf with greate&s;t power: in
childhood it has &s;carce begun to dawn; in old
age it &s;inks into a glimmering twilight. Were
it only on account of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance from me|mory
of which it &s;tands in need, it mu&s;t be in
&s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ubject to the&s;e changes. But
this is not the only or the principal cau&s;e of
its being &s;ubject to them; the powers on
which it has a more immediate and e&s;&s;ential
dependence, are &s;ubject to the &s;ame changes.
It is a general law of our nature, that all our
faculties ri&s;e gradually to their perfection, and
gradually decline.</P>
<P>MEMORY admits much greater varieties
in different per&s;ons, varieties both in degree
and in kind.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276">
THERE are chiefly four perfections of which
memory is capable. The&s;e are rarely united
in the &s;ame per&s;on; and the prevalence of one
of them, or the manner and degree in which
they are united, produces very great diver&s;i|ties
in the memories of different per&s;ons.
Some of the perfections of memory ari&s;e from
the &s;trength with which &s;eparate perceptions
are remembered, others from the ability of
remembering their connexions firmly.&mdash;It is
a perfection of memory to be <HI>&s;u&s;ceptible,</HI> to
receive an impre&s;&s;ion quickly: it is likewi&s;e
a perfection of memory to be <HI>tenacious</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ejus duplex virtus, facile percipere, et fideliter conti|nere. QUINT. <HI>In&s;t. Orat.</HI> lib. i. cap. 4.</NOTE>.
Both the&s;e perfections ari&s;e chiefly from a fit|ne&s;s
for remembering &s;eparate perceptions:
but they do not always go together; nay,
they who commit a thing quickly to memory,
generally forget it &s;oone&s;t. This may &s;eem
to contradict the maxim, that perceptions ori|ginally
&s;trong, are firmly remembered. But
it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with it. Becau&s;e the
impre&s;&s;ion is made quickly, it does not follow
that it is &s;trong: a &s;u&s;ceptible memory, like a
&s;oft body, receives &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion at once,
and becau&s;e this impre&s;&s;ion is perceivable at
once, we are at no pains to deepen it, we al|low
<PB N="270" REF="277">
it to continue &s;light: when the memory
is, as it were, of a harder contexture, the im|pre&s;&s;ion
is not made without continued labour,
it is deep before it can be at all taken notice
of, and therefore it is permanent<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Etiam illa praevelox &s;ere cito e&s;&s;luit, et velut prae&s;enti officio functa nihil in po&s;terum debeat, tanquam dimi&s;&s;a di&s;|cedit. Nec e&s;t mirum magis haerere animo, quae diutius affixa &s;int. QUINT. <HI>In&s;t. Orat.</HI> lib. xi. cap. 2.</NOTE>. Some|times
the&s;e perfections are united: the me|mory
is of &s;uch a happy temperature as may
be compared to wax, which receives the &s;eal
ea&s;ily and &s;trongly when it is melted, and im|mediately
hardens and &s;uffers it not to be
effaced. Of the&s;e two perfections, the former
is in its nature and principles mo&s;t congenial
to genius; but the latter is at lea&s;t equally
&s;ub&s;ervient to its operations; for no percep|tion
can be &s;ugge&s;ted by fancy or applied to
any purpo&s;e, except it be remembered.&mdash;It is
a perfection of memory to be <HI>di&s;tinct,</HI> to ex|hibit
things in their proper form and order:
it is al&s;o a perfection to be <HI>ready,</HI> to call to
mind ea&s;ily and quickly &s;uch ideas as we have
occa&s;ion for. Di&s;tinctne&s;s relates to &s;uch things
as are in our view together; readine&s;s, to &s;uch
as make their appearance in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. They
are in&s;eparable, and always take place almo&s;t
in the &s;ame degree. They ari&s;e from the &s;ame
<PB N="271" REF="278">
principle, from a natural aptitude to retain the
relations of things. The memory cannot in|deed
be di&s;tinct, except the &s;everal &s;eparate
perceptions be well retained; the omi&s;&s;ion of
one part or member would de&s;troy the har|mony
of the whole: but di&s;tinctne&s;s ari&s;es
immediately from a lively remembrance of
their connexions; if this were wanting, all
the particulars would lie jumbled in confu&s;ion.
It is, in like manner, when the connexions of
things are &s;trongly perceived, that &s;ome of
them introduce others readily. If in &s;ome
ca&s;es there be di&s;tinctne&s;s of remembrance
without readine&s;s of recollection, the defect in
this latter virtue is owing to the weakne&s;s and
inactivity of imagination, failing to exert it|&s;elf
at the proper time. In proportion to the
degree in which the&s;e perfections of memory
are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, they mu&s;t render the energies of
genius the more perfect, and likewi&s;e affect
the form of its productions, &s;o far as it em|ploys
in them materials borrowed from me|mory.
Confu&s;ion in a work may proceed
from indi&s;tinctne&s;s of remembrance, as well
as from irregularity of imagination: not only
feeblene&s;s of imagination, but al&s;o &s;lowne&s;s of
recollection, may render a work both labori|ous
and meagre. Be&s;ides the&s;e defects, con|fu&s;ion
<PB N="272" REF="279">
and &s;lowne&s;s, which are directly oppo&s;ed
to the excellences of memory now under
con&s;ideration, there is an imperfection which
bears a relation to both the&s;e excellences,
which &s;eems to re&s;emble them, but in truth
only mimics them; I mean, the remembrance
of things merely by rote, when a per&s;on can
run over things exactly, in their ob&s;erved or|der,
and be certain of recollecting any part of
them by thus running over them, but can re|member
nothing, if he be put out of that
train. In this ca&s;e, the &s;eparate perceptions
are faintly impre&s;&s;ed upon the mind, their ex|perienced
connexions &s;trongly; and the&s;e are
the only connexions which influence it, the
relations conferred by imagination have none;
the &s;ubject likewi&s;e is not clearly under&s;tood.
The&s;e being the cau&s;es of this peculiarity of
memory, it can &s;eldom be found along with
genius, or indeed with a great degree of any
of the intellectual powers.</P>
<P>MEMORY admits likewi&s;e varieties in kind;
and the&s;e varieties tend more directly than
any hitherto mentioned, to diver&s;ity the form
of genius.</P>
<P>MANY cau&s;es were formerly pointed out,
which may render perceptions &s;trong and
&s;trongly remembered. Any one of the&s;e cau&s;es
<PB N="273" REF="280">
may render any perception or cla&s;s of percep|tions
&s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t affecting to a par|ticular
per&s;on: by &s;ome or other of the&s;e
cau&s;es, different perceptions will unavoidably
be rendered &s;tronge&s;t to different per&s;ons; and
the&s;e will, by con&s;equence, dwell mo&s;t in the
memory, and take the fa&s;te&s;t hold of it. The
objects of &s;trong remembrance will thus be
nece&s;&s;arily different in different men: and the
difference of the&s;e will occa&s;ion a corre&s;pon|dent
difference in the exertions of genius, and
that with re&s;pect both to the perceptions from
which it &s;ets out, and to tho&s;e which it after|wards
collects.</P>
<P>FIRST, the peculiar turn of memory will
affect genius, by determining, in many in|&s;tances,
the perception from which it &s;ets out,
in its inve&s;tigations or its compo&s;itions. Every
invention, it was already &s;hown, takes its ri&s;e
from &s;ome pre&s;ent perception, which &s;ugge&s;ts
the other ideas nece&s;&s;ary in the work. If
that pre&s;ent perception be not actually &s;ub|jected
to the &s;en&s;es, it mu&s;t be a perception
exhibited by memory. Memory will mo&s;t
readily exhibit tho&s;e perceptions which it re|tains
&s;trongly; for it is a never-failing effect
of &s;trong remembrance, to cau&s;e a perception
occur often, and remain almo&s;t con&s;tantly in</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="281">
our view, &s;o that it cannot be bani&s;hed with|out
difficulty, &s;ometimes not at all. But the
pre&s;ent perception, which is thus often fixt by
the peculiar ca&s;t of memory, determines ge|nius
to attach it&s;elf to &s;uch ideas as are con|nected
with it, and to follow the road which
they point out; and con&s;equently it influences
the whole &s;eries of the thoughts, and contri|butes
not a little to the peculiar form which
the work a&s;&s;umes. Several different percep|tions
being, by means of different principles,
&s;trongly remembered by the &s;ame per&s;on, will
&s;it him for exerci&s;ing his genius on different
&s;ubjects: they will al&s;o lead him to works of
different kinds; for in &s;ome &s;orts of percep|tions
one relation is more con&s;picuous and
apte&s;t to lay hold of the imagination, and in
other &s;orts another relation; and our follow|ing
one or the other, will produce a work of
one &s;pecies, or of a different &s;pecies. The
perceptions &s;trongly remembered being much
more various in different per&s;ons, than they
can be in the &s;ame per&s;on, will produce a pro|portionably
greater variety, both in the &s;ub|jects
which they choo&s;e for the exerci&s;e of ge|nius,
and in the &s;pecies of works in which
they engage.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="282">
SECONDLY, the particular things which are
&s;trongly remembered by a per&s;on, will directly
influence the ideas introduced, as well as the
perception from which he &s;ets out. Imagi|nation
can exhibit only &s;uch ideas as a per&s;on
has; ideas which he has lo&s;t, whatever is for|gotten,
cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ugge&s;ted, nor em|ployed
in any work of genius. By an inca|pacity
of retaining certain &s;orts of ideas firmly,
a man may be nece&s;&s;arily prevented from u&s;ing
materials which he once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, however fit
they would have been for compleating or
adorning his work. The ideas to which his
memory is adapted, compo&s;e the &s;tock which
he can employ. Be&s;ides, of the ideas which
he retains, tho&s;e which are retained mo&s;t
&s;trongly, will recur oftene&s;t to his view, and
con&s;equently will be mo&s;t familiar to him. On
this account they will occur and be employed
by him, more readily than any others. Ideas
by being &s;trongly remembered, force them|&s;elves
frequently into our view, and engage
our attention, when there is no particular oc|ca&s;ion
to introduce them: undoubtedly then,
when they are related to a &s;ubject on which
we are exerci&s;ing our genius, they will be &s;ug|ge&s;ted
more readily, than other ideas equally,
or even more nearly related to that &s;ubject,
<PB N="276" REF="283">
but not &s;o &s;trongly fixt in our memory. Thus
the whole complexion of a work is nece&s;&s;arily
tinged by the kind of thoughts which the
memory of the author is fitted to retain with
greate&s;t &s;trength and clearne&s;s: and hence
mu&s;t ari&s;e very great diver&s;ity in the produc|tions
of different per&s;ons, even on the &s;ame
&s;ubject; diver&s;ities proportioned to the num|ber
of ways in which the perceptions of me|mory
may be &s;trong, either in them&s;elves, or
by communication from tho&s;e with which
they are connected.</P>
<P>ALL the ob&s;erved connexions of things lay
hold of the memory in &s;ome degree; but they
do not all equally lay hold of the memory of
every man. One per&s;on's memory retains &s;ome
connexions mo&s;t &s;trongly; another per&s;on's
retains chiefly quite different connexions.
One con&s;equence of this is, that if two per|&s;ons
give an account of any object which they
remember, their de&s;criptions of it will be con|&s;iderably
different. Were they to introduce
repre&s;entations of that object into works of
genius, there would be a corre&s;pondent di&s;&s;i|militude
between the&s;e repre&s;entations. There
would be a difference likewi&s;e in the u&s;es to
which they were applied; for by being put
into different attitudes, the &s;ame object is
<PB N="277" REF="284">
adapted to different purpo&s;es. Another con|&s;equence
is, that the memories of different
per&s;ons are &s;uited to different &s;ubjects. Some
are e&s;pecially ready in remembering rea&s;on|ings,
and &s;uch phenomena and proce&s;&s;es in
nature as are the proper &s;ubjects of rea&s;oning;
the connexions of things as cau&s;es and effects,
make the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on their me|mory.
Some retain mo&s;t firmly the form and
&s;tructure of natural bodies, or de&s;criptions of
them; their memory is chiefly affected by
the co-exi&s;tence of the parts. Others retain
be&s;t, trains of events, or relations of them in
hi&s;tory; vicinity, order, and that &s;pecies of
cau&s;ation by which events depend on one ano|ther,
are the connexions which &s;uit their me|mory.
Others are remarkable for ea&s;ily re|membering
poetry; the relations of ideas
which prevail in it, lay fa&s;te&s;t hold on their
memory: many of the&s;e relations are origi|nally
be&s;towed upon the parts &s;olely by ima|gination;
but after they are be&s;towed, and the
work is read, they become ob&s;erved connex|ions
of the parts of that work, and are proper
objects of memory. Tho&s;e things which are
peculiarly &s;uitable to a per&s;on's memory, are
generally tho&s;e to which his under&s;tanding and
his ta&s;te are mo&s;t adapted. This &s;ugge&s;ts a
<PB N="278" REF="285">
rea&s;on why they are peculiarly &s;uitable to his
memory: they are the &s;ubjects to which he
can attend mo&s;t ea&s;ily and mo&s;t clo&s;ely, into
which he can enter mo&s;t deeply, and from
which he receives the greate&s;t plea&s;ure; they
cannot therefore fail to make a &s;trong and la&s;t|ing
impre&s;&s;ion on him. Their making &s;uch
an impre&s;&s;ion on him, will nece&s;&s;arily have an
influence on the turn of his genius. Every
man will introduce into his works chiefly tho&s;e
&s;ubjects which he remembers be&s;t, if they can
at all &s;uit his purpo&s;e. Both the illu&s;trations
and the epi&s;odes of one poet, relate almo&s;t con|&s;tantly
to natural things; tho&s;e of another are
generally taken from hi&s;tory, or con&s;i&s;t of nar|ration;
a third abounds on every occa&s;ion
with moral &s;entiments, or runs out into philo|&s;ophical
&s;peculations. The peculiar congruity
of different connexions to different memories,
contributes to produce variety of genius, in
the &s;ame manner, though not in &s;o great a
degree, as the predominance of one a&s;&s;ociat|ing
principle; for exertions of memory enter
into every work of genius, though only in
&s;ubordination to the exertions of imagination.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Varieties of Judgment, and their
Influence on Genius.</HEAD>
<P>IF we recollect, how con&s;tantly judgment
attends imagination, and in how many
ways it a&s;&s;i&s;ts and regulates it, in all the exer|tions
of genius, we cannot doubt that the
diver&s;ities of which judgment is &s;u&s;ceptible,
will contribute greatly to the variety of ge|nius
ob&s;ervable among men. To inve&s;tigate
the &s;everal powers of judgment, and to a&s;cer|tain
the foundation of our &s;everal convictions
and rea&s;onings, is a principal &s;ubject in all
treatises concerning human under&s;tanding;
but it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ider judgment
only &s;o far as its varieties affect the operations
of genius.</P>
<P>WHEN in the analy&s;is of genius we di&s;tin|gui&s;h
judgment from &s;en&s;e, memory, and
imagination, we u&s;e the term in its mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive

it is of two kinds, judgment of <HI>truth,</HI> and
judgment of <HI>beauty.</HI> To the former, the

TRUTH regards either real exi&s;tence, or
the relations of general ideas: judgment is
exerci&s;ed about both; and about each it is
exerci&s;ed in different ways, &s;ometimes intui|tively,
at other times by rea&s;oning, &s;ometimes
producing certainty, and at other times only
probability. It includes all the intellectual
faculties by which we di&s;tingui&s;h truth from
fal&s;ehood, embrace and a&s;&s;ent to the one, and
di&s;believe and reject the other<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The author was led, many years ago, by the office which he then held, to enquire with &s;ome care, into the&s;everal modifications of judgment, the kinds of evidence corre&s;pondent to them, and the nature and degree of convic|tion produced by them. New light has been thrown on &s;everal branches of this &s;ubject, by Dr. Reid's ingenious <HI>Inquiry;</HI> and the whole of it has been illu&s;trated with great per&s;picuity and elegance, in Dr. Beattie's <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Truth,</HI> Part I. The pre&s;ent de&s;ign admits the con&s;ideration of this &s;ubject, only in one very confined point of view, as connected with the vari|eties of genius.</NOTE>. Men dif|fer
either in the degree in which they po&s;&s;e&s;s
the &s;ame &s;pecies of judgment, or in the &s;pecies
of judgment which they are mo&s;t prone to
exerci&s;e, and exerci&s;e in greate&s;t perfection.</P>
<P>THE faculties by which we perceive &s;uch
truths as regard the relations of general ideas,
are commonly known.</P>
<P>SELF-EVIDENT truths are perceived by <HI>in|tuition</HI>
which exerts it&s;elf in an infallible
conviction that certain relations belong to the
ideas compared, and cannot but belong to
<PB N="281" REF="288">
them; and this conviction ari&s;es on the mere
compari&s;on of the ideas them&s;elves, without
any rea&s;oning. In all the proper &s;ubjects of
intuition, we perceive the relation to be im|plied
in the very nature of the ideas, &s;o that it
mu&s;t appear the &s;ame to every being, capable
of comparing them.</P>
<P>SUCH relations of ideas as are not &s;elf-evi|dent,
can be perceived only by <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> None
but the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> relations of ideas can be de|duced
by rea&s;on, merely by compari&s;on of the
ideas them&s;elves; at lea&s;t the&s;e are the only
relations which can be in this way deduced
with &s;uch certainty as to make it worth while
to attempt deducing them. The rea&s;oning
by which &s;uch relations are deduced, is called
demon&s;tration. In order to our perceiving the
force of a demo&s;tration, we mu&s;t perceive
the truth of all the &s;teps of which it con&s;i&s;ts.
But it is not properly by an exertion of rea|&s;on,
that we perceive the truth of each &s;epa|rate
&s;tep. Often the conviction is intuitive;
as when in the cour&s;e of a demon&s;tration we
a&s;&s;ume the equality of two &s;ides of a triangle,
which are radii of the &s;ame circle. Even
&s;uch propo&s;itions as have been formerly de|mon&s;trated,
when they are applied in a &s;ub|&s;equent
demon&s;tration, cannot in that ca&s;e be
<PB N="282" REF="289">
&s;trictly a&s;cribed to rea&s;on; for though it was
rea&s;on that fir&s;t produced a conviction of their
truth, it is memory that retains, and either
memory or imagination that pre&s;ents, the
conviction in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; and generally
the convition is pre&s;ented alone, without the
proofs to which it was originally owing. In
order to our deducing a conclu&s;ion from a
&s;eries of argumentation, it is nece&s;&s;ary that
we retain all the &s;teps of that &s;eries; if any of
them be forgotten, we cannot perceive the
evidence of the conclu&s;ion; and it is by me|mory
that they are retained. In con&s;equence
of all this, a conclu&s;ion is inferred from the
whole argument: the inferring of this con|clu&s;ion,
and the prodution of a conviction
of its truth, are the only exertions of rea&s;on,
as di&s;tingui&s;hed from our other intellectual
powers. Rea&s;on, &s;o far as it is employed in
demon&s;tration, is that faculty by which we
draw inferences from the compari&s;on of our
ideas, or obtain a conviction that a relation
&s;ub&s;i&s;ts between two ideas, by our having
found that the&s;e bear certain relations to other
ideas. This is an original faculty of the hu|man
mind. It is the more perfect, the more
ea&s;ily, the more quickly, and in the more in|&s;tances
we can infer conclu&s;ions by the compa|ri&s;on

of our ideas. It is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by different
men in very different degrees of perfection.
The&s;e doubtle&s;s are owing principally to an
original diver&s;ity in the faculty of rea&s;on it|&s;elf;
but as it is attended and aided in all its
exertions, by memory, and in &s;ome of them
by imagination al&s;o, its varieties may ari&s;e in
part from the degree of the&s;e latter powers
which men po&s;&s;e&s;s, and from the particular
modification of them which prevails. If a
man's memory be remarkably turned for re|taining
the relations of ideas, and his imagi|nation
for &s;ugge&s;ting them, this will a&s;&s;i&s;t him
greatly in perceiving the connexion of the
&s;everal &s;teps of a demo&s;tration, and in re|taining
them all, and will thus make his rea|&s;on
appear the more acute. But if his memory
and fancy had been ill adapted to &s;uch &s;ub|jects,
he mu&s;t, even with the &s;ame &s;hare of
rea&s;on, have run a ri&s;k of being perplexed in
pur&s;uing a long train of argumentation.</P>
<P>THE exi&s;tence and the connexions of real
things, are the &s;ubjects of very many of our
judgments. The exertions of under&s;tanding
employed about them, are different from
tho&s;e which are employed about the relations
of ideas, and likewi&s;e admit great variety.
The exi&s;tence of real things, and their con|nexions,
<PB N="284" REF="291">
are perceived intuitively; they are infer|red
by an immediate judgment of Nature; they
are deduced by a train of con&s;equences; they
are believed on the te&s;timony of others: they
are known with certainty; or they are a&s;&s;ented
to as probable in a greater or a le&s;s degree.</P>
<P>EVERY man is con&s;cious of his own &s;en&s;a|tions,
ideas, thoughts, pa&s;&s;ions, and the &s;e|veral
operations of his own mind; and while
he is con&s;cious of them, he is convinced of
their pre&s;ent exi&s;tence. The judgment which
produces this conviction, is implied in the
very nature of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and complicated
with every act of it. It is a judgment dif|ferent
in kind from our intuitive perception
of the agreement or di&s;agreement of two ideas
which we compare; but it is equally imme|diate,
equally unavoidable, and is even a pre|requi&s;ite
to that perception.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;en&s;ation, every idea, which a man
has, every operation, every pa&s;&s;ion, of which
he is con&s;cious, &s;ugge&s;ts the notion of him|&s;elf,
and enables him, without any exerci&s;e
of rea&s;on, without any information from ex|perience,
by a natural and inexplicable prin|ciple,
to infer the exi&s;tence of him&s;elf as the
percipient and agent. The inference is im|mediate,
and without any compari&s;on of
<PB N="285" REF="292">
ideas; it is likewi&s;e indubitable, the original
con&s;titution of our nature will not allow us to
call it in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>WHENEVER we have a &s;en&s;ation by means
of our bodily organs, we infer from it &s;ome
quality in bodies, which is the cau&s;e or occa|&s;ion
of it. There is an inference: but it is
made without any rea&s;oning or compari&s;on of
ideas; we can perceive no nece&s;&s;ary connexion
between the &s;en&s;ation and the quality inferred
from it: the inference is made previous to
experience: it is made by a judgment of na|ture;
our belief of it ari&s;es from an original
and inexplicable principle of the mind, which
determines us to it immediately and irre&s;i&s;|tibly.</P>
<P>WE remember our &s;en&s;ations, the qualities
of bodies which they &s;ugge&s;ted, the pa&s;&s;ions
and the operations of our minds. The re|membrance
of them implies a conviction of
their pa&s;t exi&s;tence, which is, like tho&s;e al|ready
mentioned, a judgment of nature, im|mediate,
unavoidable, and indubitable, to
which every man is determined by his con&s;ti|tution,
and of which no other account can
be given.</P>
<P>WE can compare the &s;everal objects about
which the mind employs it&s;elf, whether they
<PB N="286" REF="293">
be its own operations, or the qualities of bo|dies;
the compari&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts a great variety
of connexions and relations belonging to
them; and about all the&s;e, judgment is exer|ci&s;ed
in many different ways.&mdash;It perceives
the <HI>re&s;emblance</HI> of &s;ome things, and the di&s;&s;i|militude
of others: it perceives both intui|tively,
and it perceives them on compari&s;on of
the things them&s;elves or of their ideas. Should
we mi&s;s forming the judgment immediately,
we can never be brought to form it by argu|ment;
we can only be led to be&s;tow greater
attention, that, by our becoming more per|fectly
acquainted with the objects, the intui|tive
faculty may exert it&s;elf to greater advan|tage.
&mdash;When we compare &s;ome things
together, we perceive their <HI>contrariety;</HI> &s;ome|times
we perceive it intuitively, and &s;ome|times
experience of the things them&s;elves, or
of their cau&s;es, or of their con&s;equences, is
nece&s;&s;ary for our forming the judgment.&mdash;
When things po&s;&s;e&s;s any quality in common,
judgment may be employed in deciding con|cerning
the <HI>degree</HI> of that quality: the judg|ment
is often intuitive; it may however be
aided by continued and repeated attention;
and it is &s;ometimes produced by a mixture of
experiment and rea&s;oning. When experi|ments
<PB N="287" REF="294">
are made for enlightening the judg|ment,
they tend to exhibit the qualities more
perfectly to the mind; the rea&s;oning that is
introduced, regards the cau&s;es or the effects
of the qualities compared, or &s;erves for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing
their connexion with &s;ome pheno|mena
which ca&s;t up in the cour&s;e of the
experiment, and from which their degrees
may be inferred. A thermometer is employed
for a&s;certaining the degrees of heat; it &s;hows
immediately the degrees of expan&s;ion in the
fluid; and experience teaches us the con&s;tant
connexion between the&s;e degrees and the de|grees
of heat.&mdash;Real things bear to one
another, certain <HI>proportions</HI> in their quantity
or their number: judgment is exerci&s;ed about
the&s;e; &s;ometimes it perceives them intui|tively,
and at other times it deduces them by
various kinds of rea&s;oning.&mdash;When we
con&s;ider objects which have a continued ex|i&s;tence,
we perceive their <HI>identity,</HI> or we
judge them to be different from, however
&s;imilar to tho&s;e which we had ob&s;erved for|merly.
In this ca&s;e, our judgment is &s;ome|times
intuitive, on our comparing the pre&s;ent
object with our idea of that which we had be|fore
perceived; and &s;ometimes it is the re&s;ult of
rea&s;oning. When it is intuitive, it is, generally
<PB N="288" REF="295">
at lea&s;t, rather a judgment re&s;olvable into
our con&s;titution, than a perception of nece&s;|&s;ary
agreement or di&s;agreement: when it is
the re&s;ult of rea&s;oning, the rea&s;oning is found|ed
on our experience of the ordinary dura|tion
of the &s;everal kinds of things, of the
changes which they are capable of undergo|ing,
and of other circum&s;tances relating to
them&s;elves and their cau&s;es.&mdash;Things have
different relations in <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place:</HI> judg|ment
cannot di&s;cover the&s;e by a mere compa|ri&s;on
of the things, but by experience and
ob&s;ervation.&mdash;It is in the &s;ame way, that
we judge concerning the co-exi&s;tence of qua|lities:
we can perceive intuitively that &s;ome
qualities are incon&s;i&s;tent or incapable of be|ing
co-exi&s;tent; in &s;ome few ca&s;es al&s;o, one
quality implies another, &s;o that their co-ex|i&s;tence
is &s;elf-evident, as figure and exten&s;ion
are in&s;eparable: but in mo&s;t ca&s;es, even after
experience has &s;hown that certain qualities
are actually co-exi&s;tent, we can find out no
nece&s;&s;ary bond of union among them.&mdash;
There is a principle in our con&s;titution, which
determines us irre&s;i&s;tibly, without rea&s;oning
or proof, to judge that there is &s;ome cau&s;e of
every new exi&s;tence, and of every change
which things undergo. We have a natural
<PB N="289" REF="296">
propen&s;ity to con&s;ider particular things as
cau&s;es or effects, we pronounce them &s;uch,
not from any compari&s;on of their qualities, or
any perception of the fitne&s;s of the one to
produce the other, but from experience of
their conjunction. With re&s;pect to objects
which we have all our lives judged to &s;tand
in this relation, it is often the &s;ubject of intri|cate
and uncertain inve&s;tigation, what are the
qualities which fit them for bearing this rela|tion
to one another, and often we remain
altogether ignorant of this.</P>
<P>THERE is an original principle in our na|ture,
which determines us to judge, That the
future will re&s;emble the pa&s;t, and in&s;tances of
which we have had no experience, tho&s;e of
which we have had experience. As God has
made the cour&s;e of nature uniform and con|&s;tant,
&s;o he has formed us for placing implicit
confidence in its uniformity and con&s;tancy,
for expecting the continuance of tho&s;e con|nexions
of things, which we have hitherto
ob&s;erved. This principle is inexplicable; the
judgment to which it leads us, is immediate
and independent upon arguments. It is the
foundation of all our rea&s;onings concerning
real things. Guided by it, we conclude,
what will be, from our experience of what
<PB N="290" REF="297">
has been; the particular judgments which ex|perience
has dictated, we extend beyond the
in&s;tances of which we have had experience,
and render general: we believe that tho&s;e
qualities which we have ob&s;erved to be co|exi&s;tent,
will in all &s;imilar in&s;tances be co|exi&s;tent,
that cau&s;es will con&s;tantly produce
&s;uch effects, and effects require &s;uch cau&s;es
as they formerly have. It is to this original
principle in human nature, that we owe our
conviction in all our rea&s;onings from expe|rience.
But this principle, &s;imple and uni|form
in it&s;elf, admits great variety, and is
complicated with many exertions of the un|der&s;tanding,
in its application to particular
&s;ubjects. It will therefore be proper to make
&s;ome ob&s;ervations upon it.</P>
<P>OUR experience of the pa&s;t and of what we
are acquainted with, is the ground on which
we form all our judgments concerning the
future, and what is unknown to us. Expe|rience
is the re&s;ult of a number of particular
ob&s;ervations. Attention to the &s;everal in|&s;tances
as they occurred, and di&s;tinct remem|brance
of them afterwards, are nece&s;&s;ary for
our acquiring experience; and men's expe|rience
in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, will be
greater or le&s;s in proportion to their propen|&s;ity
<PB N="291" REF="298">
to attend to what pa&s;&s;es before them, and
their ability to remember it.&mdash;In every in|&s;tance,
the circum&s;tances which are of im|portance
for forming experience, are found
in conjunction with others which are of no
importance: there is a natural &s;agacity fit for
di&s;tingui&s;hing the&s;e, which different men po&s;|&s;e&s;s
in very different degrees; and in propor|tion
to the degree of it which a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es,
his experience will be more or le&s;s exact and
preci&s;e. Experience is not merely the re|membrance
of a number of unconnected ob|&s;ervations:
it is a judgment formed with
&s;agacity from them all together<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>. It is
formed by means of a &s;ort of ab&s;tracting
power, which &s;eparates the nece&s;&s;ary circum|&s;tances
from the accidental: and the kind and
degree of conviction that attends it, corre|&s;ponds
to the particular relation or connexion
of the things, on which our ob&s;ervation is
fixt. In &s;ome ca&s;es, there is little difficulty
in forming &s;uch a judgment with preci&s;ion;
there are few accidental and unimportant cir|cum&s;tances
joined with the nece&s;&s;ary and im|portant
<PB N="292" REF="299">
ones. In other ca&s;es, the unimportant
circum&s;tances are &s;o many, and &s;o much
blended with the important, that it requires
&s;uperior acutene&s;s to &s;eparate them: though
the particular in&s;tances be perfectly remem|bered,
yet often no experience is derived
from them, or experience very inaccurate,
and unfit for being applied to any u&s;e. This
difficulty is the primary cau&s;e of all the un|certainty
and all the intricacies which attend
our rea&s;onings from experience, and of all
the errors into which we are apt to fall in
&s;uch rea&s;onings. For want of a degree of
acutene&s;s &s;ufficient to &s;urmount the difficulty,
we form fal&s;e judgments of the connexions of
things, in the very in&s;tances which we have
had acce&s;s to ob&s;erve: and if we attempt to
rea&s;on from the&s;e in&s;tances, the fal&s;ehood
cannot fail to be communicated to all the con|clu&s;ions
which we infer.</P>
<P>AFTER we have collected experience, in
order to our rea&s;oning from it, it is nece&s;&s;ary
that it be recollected and brought into our
view when we have occa&s;ion for it. This is
the work of imagination. The in&s;tance con|cerning
which we want to draw a conclu&s;ion,
is a&s;&s;ociated with the &s;imilar in&s;tances of which
we have had experience, and &s;ugge&s;ts them.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="300">
Their being readily and perfectly &s;ugge&s;ted,
depends partly on the force of the memory
retaining them di&s;tinctly, and partly on the
vigour of the imagination, on the &s;trength
and activity of that a&s;&s;ociating principle which
connects them with the pre&s;ent in&s;tance.
Often when we have had very exten&s;ive ex|perience,
we are rendered incapable of draw|ing
a conclu&s;ion from it, by its not being
&s;ugge&s;ted at the time when it would be u&s;e|ful.
In all our experimental rea&s;onings,
imagination mu&s;t be exerted; and con&s;e|quently
men's capacity for &s;uch rea&s;onings,
mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure depend on the degree
in which they po&s;&s;e&s;s that faculty<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Perceptions of &s;ight &s;ugge&s;ting ideas of tangible quali|ties, have been con&s;idered by &s;ome philo&s;ophers as a judgment, by others as an effect of a&s;&s;ociation. What has been ju&s;t now &s;aid, accounts for this difference, and &s;hows that both are partly right. Both judgment and imagination are concerned. There was a judgment originally formed of the connexion be|tween the vi&s;ible and the tangible qualities; but it is imagina|tion that enables the perception of the former to &s;ugge&s;t the idea of the latter, and to &s;ugge&s;t it &s;o quickly and ea&s;ily, that this idea is confounded with that perception.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN our pa&s;t experience is &s;ugge&s;ted, we
compare the thing of which we want to judge,
with that experience, that we may di&s;cern
whether it corre&s;ponds to it or not. The
power of determining this ju&s;tly, is of the
&s;ame kind with that &s;agacity which enables
<PB N="294" REF="301">
us to collect accurate experience: it is the
&s;ame principle exerted in a different manner,
and in &s;omewhat different circum&s;tances: and
on our having this power in perfection, &s;ound|ne&s;s
of judgment in all our rea&s;onings from
experience, very much depends. Tho&s;e men
who are defective in it, draw their conclu&s;ions
from in&s;tances nowi&s;e &s;imilar; and therefore
their conclu&s;ions are erroneous or inaccurate.</P>
<P>WHEN experience is collected, &s;ugge&s;ted,
and applied to the in&s;tance in que&s;tion, a con|clu&s;ion
is drawn wholly by means of that ori|ginal
principle already mentioned, which leads
us to expect the continuance of things and
their connexions, according to our pa&s;t ex|perience.
When our pa&s;t experience has been
both exten&s;ive and uniform, and the pre&s;ent
in&s;tance exactly corre&s;ponds to it, we draw
the conclu&s;ion with <HI>certainty:</HI> if any of the&s;e
three circum&s;tances be wanting, if we have
had experience only in a few in&s;tances, or if
there has been a contrariety in our experi|ence,
or if the in&s;tances of which we have
had experience, do not exactly re&s;emble the
pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the conclu&s;ion is attended
only with <HI>probability,</HI> and embraced with
different degrees of <HI>opinion</HI> proportioned to
the degrees of probability. The la&s;t of the&s;e
<PB N="295" REF="302">
ca&s;es is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>analo|gical</HI>
rea&s;oning. The varieties of a&s;&s;ent in all
of them, nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from the nature of
that principle to which they are owing.</P>
<P>THE &s;everal operations of the mind which
are thus united in rea&s;oning from, experience,
a&s;&s;i&s;t and promote one another. A propen&s;ity
to ob&s;erve and attend to the &s;everal in&s;tances
which occur to us, gives &s;agacity a great ad|vantage
for collecting general experience from
them; it fixes them al&s;o deeply in the me|mory;
and renders it ea&s;ier for imagination
to &s;ugge&s;t them when we have occa&s;ion for
them. A natural &s;agacity in gathering cor|rect
experience, promotes, in its turn, atten|tion
to the objects which fall under our ob&s;er|vation,
and gives it &s;uch a direction as makes
it mo&s;t u&s;eful, by rendering our ideas of the
experienced in&s;tances determinate and di&s;tinct;
it likewi&s;e gives imagination the means of
introducing them. It was ob&s;erved already,
that a capacity of acquiring accurate experi|ence,
is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our drawing
ju&s;t conclu&s;ions: it is proper to ob&s;erve on
the other hand, that the faculty employed in
drawing &s;uch conclu&s;ions, when improved by
exerci&s;e, gives great a&s;&s;i&s;tance in acquiring
farther experience. The conclu&s;ions them|&s;elves
<PB N="296" REF="303">
al&s;o which we have deduced from ex|perience,
are u&s;eful for enabling us to collect
experience with greater ea&s;e, and with greater
correctne&s;s. Every ju&s;t conclu&s;ion with which
we become acquainted, throws new light on
the face of nature, gives us a more exten&s;ive
view of its cour&s;e and its laws, and enables
us to correct &s;ome error, to a&s;certain &s;ome
ambiguity, or to define &s;ome indi&s;tinctne&s;s,
in our former ob&s;ervations even concerning
objects which are mo&s;t familiar to us. Our
<HI>primary</HI> experience is derived from particular
in&s;tances which have fallen under our ob&s;er|vation:
from it we deduce conclu&s;ions, which
we adopt and re&s;t in: and the maxims im|plied
in the&s;e conclu&s;ions, form a &s;ort of
<HI>&s;econdary</HI> experience, by which the primary
is extended, limited, or corrected, and by
which &s;agacity is aided in forming new expe|riences
with greater acutene&s;s, facility, and
a&s;&s;urance. This &s;econdary experience has
been in &s;ome mea&s;ure acquired, and the habit
formed of applying it to u&s;e, by every man,
long before he comes to the age of reflection,
or begins to attend to the operations of his
own mind. Even that principle which leads
us to judge, that the future will re&s;emble the
pa&s;t, and in&s;tances of which we have not had
<PB N="297" REF="304">
experience, tho&s;e of which we have, is
&s;trengthened and exerts it&s;elf with greater
a&s;&s;urance, in con&s;equence of our being accu&s;|tomed
to draw conclu&s;ions from experience.
By means of this, we often allow certain be|lief
to conclu&s;ions founded on experience of a
very few in&s;tances, &s;ometimes even on a
&s;ingle trial; we take it for granted that every
&s;imilar trial will turn out in the &s;ame way;
for we have experience of the &s;tability of the
cour&s;e of Nature, and this general experience
in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upplies the place of expe|rience
in that particular ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As there are thus &s;everal powers jointly
exerted in all our rea&s;onings from experience,
it is only when all the&s;e powers exi&s;t in full
vigour, that the faculty of rea&s;oning from
experience can be perfect. The different de|grees
of the&s;e powers in different men, will
produce corre&s;pondent degrees of judgment
in matters of experience. The different pro|portions
in which the&s;e powers are united,
will occa&s;ion varieties in the form which this
kind of judgment a&s;&s;umes, and in the &s;ubjects
to which it is adapted.</P>
<P>FINALLY, there is in our nature, an ori|ginal
determination to give credit to the te&s;|timony
<PB N="298" REF="305">
of others<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See CAMPBELL'S <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on Miracles,</HI> part i. &s;ect. 1, 2. where this &s;pecies of belief is explained with great ingenuity.</NOTE>. Did this determination
exert it&s;elf without any re&s;traint, it would
lead us to believe whatever is &s;aid by others.
It would exert it&s;elf without re&s;traint, if we
had never found our&s;elves deceived by others.
But experience teaches us that others are of|ten
deceived, and that they &s;ometimes intend
to deceive, and, in con&s;equence of this di&s;co|very,
leads us to examine their te&s;timony
before we a&s;&s;ent to it. We con&s;ider the cha|racters
and the number of the witne&s;&s;es, the
ends which they may &s;erve by deceiving us,
the motives which may urge them to attempt
it, their opportunities of knowing the truth;
and we e&s;timate by the&s;e circum&s;tances, the
degree of credibility which belongs to their
reports. We compare the &s;ubject of their
te&s;timony with our own experience, and give
greater or le&s;s credit to it according to its
probability. In all this, there is ample &s;cope
for the exerci&s;e of judgment. It is chiefly
the kind of judgment employed in rea&s;oning
from experience, that is exerci&s;ed in e&s;timat|ing
the degree of a&s;&s;ent due to a particular
te&s;timony: and it is by the conclu&s;ions and
<PB N="299" REF="306">
maxims which we have deduced from expe|rience,
that we re&s;train and limit our a&s;&s;ent to
te&s;timony. On the other hand, the informa|tion
which we receive from the te&s;timony of
others, is added to our own ob&s;ervations, be|comes
a part of our experience, and extends
it, and is built upon as a foundation in our
experimental rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>WE judge of beauty, as well as of truth:
the faculty by which we judge of it, is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the name of <HI>ta&s;te.</HI> It likewi&s;e is
&s;u&s;ceptible of great varieties, which contribute
to diver&s;ify the forms and exertions of genius.
The influence of ta&s;te does not, like that of
judgment, extend to all the kinds of genius;
and therefore we have not hitherto been led
to a particular con&s;ideration of it: it is &s;uffi|cient
to ob&s;erve in general, That it influences
genius in producing beauty, in the &s;ame ways
in which judgment influences all the exertions
of genius. Indeed the effects formerly a&s;crib|ed
to judgment<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Part I. &s;ect. 4.</NOTE>, proceed in a great mea|&s;ure
from that &s;pecies of it which we call
ta&s;te, in all &s;uch works of genius as are pro|per
objects of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>THE varieties of ta&s;te are either in degree
or in kind. In every in&s;tance, it is a com|pound
<PB N="300" REF="307">
of judgment properly &s;o called, and of
the internal &s;en&s;es<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>E&s;&s;ay on Ta&s;te,</HI> Part II. &s;ect. 2.</NOTE>. Both the&s;e may be
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in very different degrees of &s;trength;
and every difference in the degree of either,
will produce a corre&s;pondent difference in the
degree of ta&s;te.&mdash;The ta&s;te of one man holds
chiefly of judgment, the ta&s;te of another man,
chiefly of the internal &s;en&s;es. This will ren|der
their ta&s;tes different in kind. One &s;et of
qualities are the proper objects of judgment,
another &s;et immediately affect and exerci&s;e
the internal &s;en&s;es: the one &s;et or the other
will be principally attended to and perceived
by a per&s;on, according as judgment or inter|nal
&s;en&s;e is the prevailing principle in his
ta&s;te.&mdash;Each of the&s;e principles al&s;o is &s;u&s;|ceptible
of great varieties. The varieties of
judgment have been ju&s;t now enumerated:
&s;everal of them enter into tho&s;e exertions
which regard the objects of ta&s;te, fit men for
taking different views of the&s;e objects, and
give ta&s;te di&s;&s;imilar turns. One judges be&s;t
of the proportion of the parts, another of
utility; each is mo&s;t plea&s;ed with and &s;ets the
highe&s;t value upon that quality of which he
is the mo&s;t capable judge. The internal
&s;en&s;es are many, and are adapted to different
<PB N="301" REF="308">
&s;ubjects, or to the different qualities of the
&s;ame &s;ubject<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Ta&s;te, <HI>Part I.</HI></NOTE>: the predominance, there|fore,
of any one of the&s;e &s;en&s;es will give ta&s;te
a corre&s;pondent form. One man is &s;u&s;cep|tible
of &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions from grandeur and
&s;ublimity; another has a quick feeling of the
beautiful and elegant: one has a ta&s;te for the
harmony of &s;ounds, another for the graceful|ne&s;s
of forms.</P>
<P>THE perfection of ta&s;te con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>&s;en&s;ibility,
re&s;inement, correctne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>the ju&s;t proportion
of its principles</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid&punc;</HI> Part II. &s;ect. 4, 5, 6, 7.</NOTE>. In all the&s;e re&s;pects, the
ta&s;tes of different men differ extremely: we
find in individuals, all the intermediate de|grees
between an almo&s;t total want of any of
the&s;e qualities, and the utmo&s;t perfection of
it.&mdash;A per&s;on may likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s one of the&s;e
perfections, while he is defective in the re&s;t:
or, without being remarkably defective in any
of them, he may be eminent in one. Hence
will &s;pring di&s;&s;imilar kinds of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>OF the kinds of judgment which have been
enumerated, &s;ome belong in a nearly equal
degree to all men. Such is that intuitive
faculty by which we perceive the &s;elf-evident
relations of general ideas: &s;uch are our na|tural
<PB N="302" REF="309">
judgments concerning the exi&s;tence of
our perceptions and of the qualities and be|ings
immediately &s;ugge&s;ted by them. Any
defect in the&s;e &s;pecies of judgment, would
totally di&s;qualify men for ordinary life.
The&s;e admitting no variety, can produce no
diver&s;ities of genius. Some philo&s;ophers
have not, indeed, allowed the&s;e their due
weight, and in con&s;equence of that, have
attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h paradoxes, and intro|duce
&s;ceptici&s;m incon&s;i&s;tent with them. But
this has not proceeded from their being de&s;ti|tute
of the&s;e powers, or from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
them in a le&s;s degree than other men; for
their behaviour in common life &s;hows that
they pay &s;ufficient regard to them: but it
has proceeded from their not reflecting upon
them, and explaining them to them&s;elves, in
analyzing human nature. It is, therefore,
only an error in their theories, not a &s;ign of
any imperfection in their con&s;titution.</P>
<P>OTHER powers of judgment are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by different men in very different degrees;
and &s;ome who excel in one kind, are defec|tive
in another. They who have great
acutene&s;s in mathematical and demon&s;trative
rea&s;oning, &s;ometimes betray great weakne&s;s in
arguing from experience, and judging con|cerning
<PB N="303" REF="310">
matters of fact. On the other hand,
there have been in&s;tances of per&s;ons, who
could &s;carce perceive the evidence of the ea|&s;ie&s;t
demon&s;tration in Euclid's Elements, and
were incapable of apprehending mathematical
rea&s;onings of length and intricacy; but could
judge very prudently in common life, draw
conclu&s;ions from experience with great ex|actne&s;s,
and under&s;tand all the &s;ciences which
con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch conclu&s;ions. It is not &s;urpri&s;|ing
that it &s;hould be &s;o: for not only is that
rea&s;on by which we perceive the relations of
general ideas, different from that judgment
to which we owe our conviction in matters of
experience; but al&s;o in the&s;e two kinds of
rea&s;oning, memory and imagination are ex|erted
about different &s;ubjects, to which dif|ferent
modifications of the&s;e powers are
adapted. Some have a talent in philo&s;ophical
rea&s;onings, deducing the cau&s;es and the ge|neral
laws of things from their phenomena,
or tracing the appearances which will re&s;ult
from any &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;es or laws, who never|thele&s;s
are ill qualified for unravelling hi&s;to|rical
doubts, or tracing the motives and the
con&s;equences of human actions. Others are
great ma&s;ters in rea&s;oning concerning human
life, who have no great abilities for rea&s;on|ings
<PB N="304" REF="311">
concerning human nature, the &s;ubject of
philo&s;ophical inve&s;tigation mo&s;t nearly allied
to that. Though conclu&s;ions of the&s;e dif|ferent
kinds, be &s;ometimes deduced from the
very &s;ame facts, yet for the deduction of
them, the&s;e facts mu&s;t be &s;et in different
lights, different circum&s;tances of them mu&s;t
be attended to, and a different &s;ort of ab&s;trac|tion
exerci&s;ed, as well as a different kind of
in&s;tances &s;ugge&s;ted by fancy for &s;upporting
the conclu&s;ion. It happens much more fre|quently,
that a per&s;on, along with great
powers of rea&s;on, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es but imperfect
ta&s;te, or that a per&s;on of fine ta&s;te, is not
remarkable for vigour or depth of under&s;tand|ing.
Every man will be prone to exerci&s;e
that kind of judgment in which he excels,
and to &s;tudy the &s;ubjects which give &s;cope to
it; and he will &s;hun &s;uch &s;ubjects as require a
kind of judgment in which he is deficient:
the former kind will be improved by habit,
the latter will be impaired by neglect. Hence
the original differences of judgment will be
increa&s;ed. The kinds of judgment which
thus admit variety in them&s;elves, are they
that diver&s;ify the form and the exertions of
genius. In what manner they diver&s;ify them,
will appear from the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="312">
IMAGINATION cannot in any ca&s;e perfect
its di&s;coveries without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of judg|ment.
Imagination collects materials; a cer|tain
kind and degree of judgment is nece&s;&s;ary
for applying them to u&s;e. If they are not
applicable to any purpo&s;e which &s;uits a per|&s;on's
turn of under&s;tanding or ta&s;te, or if he
has not a degree of the&s;e powers &s;ufficient for
di&s;cerning that purpo&s;e and adapting the ma|terials
to it, they will be thrown a&s;ide as u&s;e|le&s;s,
or at mo&s;t pre&s;erved in their indige&s;ted
form. Since the revival of natural philo&s;o|phy,
many have tried multitudes of experi|ments,
who wanting the judgment nece&s;&s;ary
for di&s;cerning the re&s;ult of them, have not
been able to deduce any general conclu&s;ions
from them. There is a degree of imagina|tion
requi&s;ite for contriving experiments;
there may be genius &s;hown in conducting and
varying them; but it is genius only for na|tural
hi&s;tory. Along with a turn of imagi|nation
fit for leading from one experiment to
another, there is a &s;trong propen&s;ity to attend
to the circum&s;tances of particular facts: but
there is a weakne&s;s in the ab&s;tracting power,
and a defect in the other faculties employed
in rea&s;oning from facts, which prevent the
mind's advancing to general deductions of
<PB N="306" REF="313">
laws and cau&s;es. In order to produce philo|&s;ophical
genius, there mu&s;t be &s;uperadded,
acutene&s;s in di&s;cerning the re&s;ult of experi|ments,
and comparing them together, an ap|titude
for recollecting ob&s;ervations as they be|come
nece&s;&s;ary, a propen&s;ity to &s;earch for
cau&s;es and connexions. A per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of this ca&s;t of mind, will draw conclu&s;ions
from the appearances ob&s;erved by others,
which they them&s;elves could never have
thought of: and yet this per&s;on has not per|haps
the turn of imagination, or the degree
of attention nece&s;&s;ary for making all the trials
which they made. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of genius for
natural <HI>&s;cience,</HI> he may be rather defective in
that kind of genius which &s;erves to promote
natural <HI>hi&s;tory.</HI> Boyle had an admirable turn
for making experiments, he made many with
great accuracy on a variety of &s;ubjects; he
made &s;ome concerning the appearance of light
by the pri&s;m, he ob&s;erved the oblong image
of rays refracted by means of it, he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
that image into five different colours,
and he made &s;ome remarks upon this pheno|menon<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>BOYLE</HI> Exper. et Con&s;iderat. de Coloribus, <HI>Par. III. Exp.</HI> 4.</NOTE>;
but he thought not of inferring
from it, the different degrees of refrangibility
in the rays of light. A different kind of
<PB N="307" REF="314">
judgment, or a &s;uperior degree of the &s;ame kind
of judgment, enabled Newton, from the &s;ame
phenomenon, to form many conclu&s;ions on
this &s;ubject<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Optics,</HI> Book I.</NOTE>. Ever &s;ince electricity began
to attract the attention of the curious, many
per&s;ons have employed them&s;elves in making
experiments relating to it, and have di&s;played
con&s;iderable ingenuity in making them; but
mo&s;t of the&s;e have not di&s;covered philo&s;ophi|cal
or &s;cientific ingenuity. It is to a very
few in the large catalogue of electricians, that
philo&s;ophical genius can be a&s;cribed; for to
a very few is confined all that has been done
in accounting for the phenomena of electrical
experiments, and deducing important prin|ciples
from them.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on wants the kind or degree
of judgment nece&s;&s;ary for applying the mate|rials
which imagination has collected, to that
purpo&s;e of invention to which they might be
&s;ub&s;ervient, his genius is repre&s;&s;ed, the di&s;|appointment
tends to prevent his indulging
him&s;elf in again ama&s;&s;ing materials of the
&s;ame &s;ort, and to make him turn his fancy to
&s;uch works as, being more &s;uitable to the turn
of his judgment, he can pro&s;ecute with &s;uc|ce&s;s.
By this means, his genius will be, &s;till
more than it originally was, confirmed in that
<PB N="308" REF="315">
direction to which his powers of judgment
are be&s;t adapted. There are not wanting in|&s;tances
of per&s;ons who, finding their turn of
judgment and ta&s;te imperfectly adapted to
that &s;pecies of exertion to which their imagi|nation
had fir&s;t prompted them, have quitted
it for another &s;pecies to which they found
the&s;e powers more adequate, and in which
they could therefore become more correct.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame materials may be applied to dif|ferent
purpo&s;es. They will be applied by
every per&s;on chiefly to that purpo&s;e which his
judgment be&s;t enables him to accompli&s;h. If
the imaginations of two men were &s;o &s;imilar
as to collect the very &s;ame materials, or to
&s;ugge&s;t the &s;ame ideas; yet if their turns of
judgment be di&s;&s;imilar, they will apply the&s;e
to purpo&s;es as di&s;&s;imilar, and be unlike in the
particular form and in all the exertions of
their genius.</P>
<P>JUDGMENT not only receives the materials
&s;elected by imagination, and forms them for
u&s;e, but al&s;o excites imagination, and &s;ets it
a-working. The deci&s;ions of judgment, as
well as our &s;en&s;ations and ideas, are percep|tions
which may give an impul&s;e to imagina|tion,
and direct it into a particular track of
thinking. Men's deci&s;ions upon the mate|rials
<PB N="309" REF="316">
before them, will be different, according
to the &s;pecies of judgment in which they ex|cel;
and will give proportionably different
impul&s;es to the imagination, and make it to
move in proportionably different directions.
On this account, judgment mu&s;t have a &s;trong
tendency to diver&s;ify the form of genius.
Genius takes very few &s;teps in any inve&s;tiga|tion,
in any train of &s;entiment and thinking,
or in forming any de&s;ign, without receiving
an impul&s;e from judgment: through its whole
progre&s;s, conclu&s;ions and determinations are
intermixed clo&s;ely and at very &s;hort intervals,
with the &s;ugge&s;tions of fancy; and the con|clu&s;ions
and determinations thus intermixed,
will always be &s;uch chiefly as proceed from
that modification of judgment in which the
per&s;on excells. A prevailing ta&s;te for the
Iudicrous, determined the genius of Peter di
Co&s;imo, though fit for producing greater
works, to &s;uch &s;ubjects of painting as ad|mitted
only &s;atyrs, harpies, and the like
whim&s;ical and mon&s;trous figures. It was the
correcte&s;t ta&s;te for beauty, continually regu|lating
and in&s;tigating a fine imagination, that
produced the purity of de&s;ign, the &s;weetne&s;s
of di&s;po&s;ition, the propriety and grace, by
which Raphael is characteri&s;ed. A defect in
<PB N="310" REF="317">
that ta&s;te rendered Correggio in &s;ome re&s;pects
incorrect and ungraceful, while a &s;trong reli&s;h
for the &s;ublime, prompting and directing an
imagination well formed for producing it,
be&s;towed upon him a peculiar greatne&s;s of
manner<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><HI>FRESNOY'S</HI> Judgment of Painters.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF a man be defective in the &s;pecies of
judgment requi&s;ite for any particular deter|minations
or conclu&s;ions, &s;o as not to form
them at all, or to form them wrong, when
they become nece&s;&s;ary, his fancy will be at
a &s;tand, his genius will be unable to carry
the work farther forward, or to improve it to
a higher degree of excellence. Did the judg|ment
of an arti&s;t enable him to perceive the
particulars in which he is faulty, his genius
would often be &s;ufficient to correct them;
their remaining therefore in his works, &s;hows
that his judgment was not able to &s;crutinize
them properly: Titian relinqui&s;hed the dry
manner of his ma&s;ter, which appeared in his
fir&s;t paintings, as &s;oon as his judgment was
improved enough to perceive and to di&s;approve
it; though Ludovico Carracci for &s;ome time
&s;howed little genius for painting, yet after
his judgment was improved by the diligent
&s;tudy of the works of great painters, it gave
<PB N="311" REF="318">
his fancy &s;o powerful an impul&s;e, that he be|came
excellent in de&s;ign, colouring, and
grace<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">FRESNOY, ibid. Graham's account of painters.</NOTE>; without that improvement of judg|ment,
the genius of the&s;e arti&s;ts mu&s;t have
remained defective. In every part of natural
&s;cience, experiments have been made with
great accuracy, by &s;ome who were not turned
for ob&s;erving all the circum&s;tances of the ex|periments;
the&s;e circum&s;tances have been
minutely ob&s;erved by &s;ome who, for want of
the power of ab&s;traction, could not determine
the re&s;ult of the experiments; and &s;ome who
were capable of determining this, have been
hindered from pu&s;uing the conclu&s;ions to
which it might have led, not only for want
of imagination &s;ufficient for carrying on the
inve&s;tigation, but al&s;o for want of the &s;pecies
of judgment which mu&s;t have been employed
in it.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame materials may give occa&s;ion for
determinations and conclu&s;ions of different
&s;orts: if a per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s only the kind of
judgment fit for forming one of the&s;e &s;orts,
immediately on forming them, he will leave
the road pur&s;ued by another who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
a different kind of judgment, had formed
di&s;&s;imilar conclu&s;ions, he will go forward in
<PB N="312" REF="319">
a peculiar track, and arrive at a very di&s;tant
point. Newton formed a judgment concern|ing
the unequal refraction of the rays of light,
from &s;ome of the &s;imple&s;t pri&s;matical experi|ments:
it was this judgment that &s;ugge&s;ted
to him the &s;ub&s;equent experiments proper for
a&s;certaining that principle, and gradually
opened up the wonderful cour&s;e of ob&s;erva|tions
and the noble train of di&s;coveries which
he made concerning light and colours; and
in the pro&s;ecution of the&s;e, both the mo&s;t vi|gorous
power of ab&s;traction, and the mo&s;t
piercing judgment of mathematical truth,
were continually exerted. Boyle was inferi|our
to Newton in the former of the&s;e powers,
and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no great degree of the latter;
his turn of under&s;tanding led him not to form
the &s;ame conclu&s;ion from the mo&s;t obvious
experiments; by not having formed it, his
genius was at a &s;tand in deducing the laws of
refraction, he quitted the pri&s;matic experi|ments
without applying them to any u&s;e: but
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed judgment of another kind, and
by means of it, from a multitude of experi|ments
deduced conclu&s;ions of a different na|ture,
concerning the immediate cau&s;es of co|lours
in particular bodies, and the methods of
producing them.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="320">
IT was already &s;hown, That <HI>regularity</HI> of
imagination is an e&s;&s;ential con&s;tituent of ge|nius;
that this regularity con&s;i&s;ts in a capa|city
of keeping the end of a work &s;teadily in
view, and a propen&s;ity to &s;ubordinate the
parts to that end; and that, though it be pri|marily
founded in a particular turn of the
imagination, it is promoted by the exerci&s;e
of judgment, and could not, without this,
attain tolerable perfection. It is judgment
that perceives when imagination deviates from
the paths which lead to the end propo&s;ed; it
is owing to this perception, that imagination
is recalled from its wanderings, and made to
&s;et out anew in the right road; and it is the
frequent exerci&s;e of judgment in this employ|ment,
that gives imagination an habitual re|gularity
and correctne&s;s. This excellence of
imagination mu&s;t therefore have a great de|pendence
both on the <HI>degree</HI> and on the <HI>kind</HI>
of judgment which a per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>THE acuter any &s;pecies of judgment is, the
more readily, the more certainly, and the
more con&s;tantly, it will ob&s;erve and check
every improper excur&s;ion of fancy. Genius
will therefore, in every man, acquire a degree
of correctne&s;s in &s;ome mea&s;ure proportioned
to the exactne&s;s of his judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="321">
FURTHER, the means adapted to different
ends, are connected with the&s;e ends by diffe|rent
relations, and promote them in different
manners. According therefore to the variety
of the ends propo&s;ed, a different kind of judg|ment
is nece&s;&s;ary, for di&s;cerning, whether
the materials collected, have or have not a
tendency to promote them. On this account,
men's diver&s;ity in point of judgment will give
their imaginations different &s;orts of regula|rity,
and con&s;equently mould their genius
into different forms. Hence a per&s;on who
thinks and compo&s;es with great correctne&s;s
on one kind of &s;ubject, often runs into great
wildne&s;s and irregularity on a different kind.
No two arts are more analogous than poetry
and eloquence; but the poet aims chiefly at
plea&s;ing, and the orator at moving. The
poet may have a very nice di&s;cernment of the
qualities which are fit to plea&s;e, and may
conduct a poem with the utmo&s;t regularity;
and yet may be incapable of producing a re|gular
oration: the qualities which tend to
move, are different in &s;ome re&s;pects from tho&s;e
which plea&s;e; to move, objects mu&s;t be &s;et
in a different light, and de&s;cribed in a diffe|rent
manner, from what pure poetry would
require; to di&s;cern their tendency to move,
<PB N="315" REF="322">
a &s;ort of judgment different from the poeti|cal,
is nece&s;&s;ary; if the poet have not this
&s;ort of judgment, he cannot &s;ucceed in elo|quence,
the parts of his oration, though &s;e|parately
beautiful, will be often improper and
mi&s;placed. Indeed a poet always runs a ri&s;k
of becoming florid, de&s;ultory and incorrect,
in an oration; he cannot e&s;cape it, except he
po&s;&s;e&s;s judgment of another kind, as well as
that which pure poetry would demand.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e &s;everal ways which have been
mentioned, in fitting men for applying their
ideas to different purpo&s;es, in leading imagi|nation
into different tracks, and in be&s;towing
on it different kinds of regularity, judgment
is active in diver&s;ifying the forms of genius.
But it may likewi&s;e be ob&s;erved, That, inde|pendent
of this influence of judgment upon
genius, there will always be a con&s;iderable
analogy in the form of the&s;e two powers. In
all ca&s;es, &s;ome exertions of imagination are
intermixed with tho&s;e of judgment. In ma|thematical
rea&s;onings, truths &s;elf-evident, or
already demon&s;trated, are &s;ea&s;onably &s;ugge&s;ted
by fancy; in experimental rea&s;onings, parti|cular
facts and conclu&s;ions from them, are in
like manner &s;ugge&s;ted; in experimental rea|&s;onings
of different kinds, different &s;orts of
<PB N="316" REF="323">
facts and conclu&s;ions are brought into view;
in the fine arts, fancy is continually employed
in exhibiting to ta&s;te, tho&s;e qualities concern|ing
which it pronounces. In con&s;equence of
this, every man has an advantage for excel|ling
in that &s;pecies of judgment, which is
mo&s;t congruous to the turn of his imagina|tion:
and on the other hand, his imagination
will take that turn which is mo&s;t &s;uitable to
the peculiarity of his judgment. Thus, by
the influence which the&s;e two powers mutu|ally
exert on one another, each of them is &s;o
moulded and altered, that their habitual form
and character becomes in a great mea&s;ure the
&s;ame.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Kinds of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO we have endeavoured to
inve&s;tigate &s;eparately the &s;ources from
which the diver&s;ities of genius &s;pring. In
this inve&s;tigation, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;earch
out the varieties incident to tho&s;e powers
which are any ways concerned in the opera|tions
of genius; for the&s;e varieties are the
&s;imple principles, by the combination of &s;everal
of which every di&s;tinct kind or form of genius
is con&s;tituted. We mu&s;t now pur&s;ue a dif|ferent
method. Every kind of genius de|rives
its denomination mo&s;t properly from the
nature of the object about which it is em|ployed,
or of the end to which it is adapted.
The di&s;tinction, therefore, of the kinds of ge|nius,
may be mo&s;t commodiou&s;ly deduced
from the difference of their objects and ends:
and di&s;tingui&s;hing them according to the&s;e, we
mu&s;t explain each, by combining the prin|ciples
already e&s;tabli&s;hed, and pur&s;uing them
through their natural con&s;equences.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="318" REF="325">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Genius twofold; for Science, or for the Arts.</HEAD>
<P>THE ends to which Genius may be
adapted, are reducible to two; the
di&s;covery of <HI>truth,</HI> and the production of
<HI>beauty.</HI> The former belongs to the <HI>&s;ciences,</HI>
the latter to the <HI>arts.</HI> Genius is, then, the
power of invention, either in &s;cience or in the
arts, either of truth or of beauty.</P>
<P>THERE are great differences between one
&s;cience and another, and between one art and
another. On account of the&s;e differences,
each &s;cience and each art requires &s;omething
peculiar in the genius which is &s;uited to it. I
intend not, at pre&s;ent, to de&s;cend to the inve&s;ti|gation
of the&s;e minuter peculiarities: it would
be curious; but it would be likewi&s;e intricate:
at any rate it is naturally po&s;terior to the illu&s;|tration
of the more general di&s;tinctions of
genius.</P>
<P>THERE is likewi&s;e a general analogy among
all the &s;ciences, and among all the arts: and
therefore we may expect to find &s;ome charac|ters
common to &s;cientific genius in all the
forms which it a&s;&s;umes, and other characters,
di&s;&s;imilar to the&s;e, common to all the kinds of
<PB N="319" REF="326">
genius which are exerted in the arts. The&s;e
are the characters which I &s;hall endeavour to
a&s;certain.</P>
<P>SOME difference between genius for &s;cience,
and genius for the arts, ari&s;es nece&s;&s;arily from
the very diver&s;ity of their ends. I begin with
this. Scientific genius addre&s;&s;es its di&s;cove|ries
to the under&s;tanding; their end is infor|mation:
genius for the arts addre&s;&s;es its pro|ductions
to ta&s;te, and aims at plea&s;ing by
them. It is a property of genius, that it keeps
the end of the work continually in view, and
by the view of it, modifies all the parts of the
work, and &s;elects the means which it employs
&s;o as they may be &s;ub&s;ervient to that end.
This contributes to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e two kinds
of genius, and to render all their operations
and efforts very di&s;&s;imilar: they con&s;ider all
their objects in perfectly different lights.</P>
<P>SCIENTIFIC genius leads a per&s;on to look
out only for &s;uch objects and ideas as imply
&s;ome truth, or &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome new conclu&s;ion.
A&s;&s;i&s;ted by the con&s;tant perception of this end,
any relation is &s;ufficient for introducing &s;uch
objects and ideas; all the a&s;&s;ociating princi|ples
are put upon the &s;earch for them; every
objects which the&s;e principles pre&s;ent, is &s;ted|dily
contemplated in that point of view in
<PB N="320" REF="327">
which it contributes to this purpo&s;e; all the
circum&s;tances of it which contribute to this
purpo&s;e, are &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;ought out and exa|mined
with care; objects and circum&s;tances
of objects, which contribute nothing to it, ei|ther
are not at all &s;ugge&s;ted, or are in&s;tantly
perceived to be u&s;ele&s;s, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without
the &s;malle&s;t notice. Genius for the arts ren|ders
the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth it, equally in|tent
on plea&s;ing ta&s;te by his work. In con|&s;equence
of its impul&s;e, objects and ideas fit
to gratify ta&s;te, are very readily &s;ugge&s;ted to
him; they are drawn into his view by their
relation to the de&s;ign, as well as by the rela|tions
which they bear to one another; as &s;oon
as they are &s;ugge&s;ted, they are moulded into
that form, and placed in that attitude, in
which they promote this de&s;ign, and they are
contemplated in that form and attitude alone:
&s;uch objects and &s;uch circum&s;tances of objects
as are unfit to plea&s;e, either do not at all occur
to the arti&s;t, or, being perceived at one glance
to be unfit, are immediately rejected.</P>
<P>BY this fixt a&s;&s;ociation of &s;o di&s;&s;imilar ends,
the two kinds of genius become very unlike
in all their exertions. In every complex ob|ject
that can engage our attention, there are
two &s;orts of qualities; there are &s;ome which
<PB N="321" REF="328">
give us plea&s;ure or pain, and there are others
which convey perceptions of an indifferent
nature. Genius for the arts directs the at|tention
chiefly to the former &s;ort, and it leads
to con&s;ider them only &s;o far as they either im|mediately
produce, or remotely contribute to
plea&s;ure or pain. Qualities which appear in|different
to &s;en&s;e, gratify ta&s;te in &s;ome &s;itu|ations:
whenever they do, they attract the
notice and employ the powers of genius for
the arts. The mere perception of exten&s;ion
is indifferent; but the largene&s;s of its quan|tity
produces grandeur, its terminations form
figures either beautiful or &s;ignificant; a ju&s;t
repre&s;entation of it often di&s;plays &s;kill: in all
the&s;e ca&s;es it is a &s;ource of plea&s;ure, and en|gages
the notice and employs the abilities of
the poet and the painter. Both tho&s;e quali|ties
of things which give plea&s;ure or pain,
and tho&s;e which give neither, enter into the
&s;ciences and affect the genius adapted to them.
But the former are generally con&s;idered ab|&s;tractedly
from the plea&s;ure or pain which
they give; and even when the&s;e are taken into
the account, the philo&s;opher proceeds as if he
were in&s;en&s;ible to them, makes them the &s;ub|ject
of cool enquiry, examines what truth
<PB N="322" REF="329">
they indicate, analyzes the feelings, or traces
the cau&s;es and effects of them.</P>
<P>THE philo&s;opher de&s;cribes minutely all the
appearances of his object: his de&s;ign requies
it; every one of them involves &s;ome truth;
inattention to any one of them may prevent
the di&s;covery of truth, or occa&s;ion error; tho&s;e
of them which &s;eem lea&s;t &s;triking, often lead
mo&s;t directly to truth, or lead to the mo&s;t im|portant
truths. A poet, on the contrary,
would overlook by far the greate&s;t part of
the&s;e appearances; they are unfit to plea&s;e,
and for that rea&s;on attract no &s;hare of his at|tention:
he fixes on a few that are mo&s;t &s;trik|ing,
and labours to &s;et the&s;e in a &s;triking light.
The ob&s;ervation of many minute circum|&s;tances,
and a variety of exact men&s;urations,
were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a&s;certaining the
laws of light and colours; and Newton's ge|nius
gave him a propen&s;ity to attend to them:
the&s;e would make no figure in poetry; and a
poet, though perfectly acquainted with them,
would never once think of them while engaged
in compo&s;ition; he would catch &s;ome general
appearances, and be &s;atisfied with the&s;e.</P>
<P>A GENIUS for &s;cience is formed by <HI>pene|tration,</HI>
a genius for the arts, by <HI>brightne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="330">
There are, perhaps, no general characters by
which the&s;e two kinds of genius can be more
properly di&s;criminated. Each of the&s;e cha|racters
is produced by certain peculiar quali|ties
of tho&s;e powers on which genius has a
dependence. In the one of them are combined
modifications of imagination, memory, and
judgment, different from tho&s;e modifications
of the &s;ame powers, which are combined in
the other: the&s;e powers likewi&s;e are combined
in different proportions.</P>

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Structure of Imagination, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
the two kinds of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>BOTH penetration and brightne&s;s imply
a great extent and compa&s;s of imagi|nation,
or great vigour of the a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciples;
but they imply different &s;orts of com|pa&s;s
and vigour. Penetration implies &s;uch a
force of imagination as leads to the compre|hen&s;ion
and explication of a &s;ubject: bright|ne&s;s
of imagination fits a man for adorning
a &s;ubject. A penetrating mind emits the rays
by which truth is di&s;covered: a bright fancy
&s;upplies the colours by which beauty is pro|duced.
There are many peculiarities of ima|gination,
<PB N="324" REF="331">
which contribute to the formation
of the&s;e oppo&s;ite characters: by tracing out
the&s;e, our general de&s;cription of the di&s;tinc|tion
between genius for &s;cience and genius
for the arts, will be ju&s;tified, and a more par|ticular
view will be obtained of the difference
of the&s;e two kinds.</P>
<P>ACUTENESS of judgment is e&s;&s;ential to pe|netration,
but cannot alone produce it. It
would produce correctne&s;s and readine&s;s in
deciding upon materials which were in our
view: but penetration implies, over and above
this, a capacity of bringing quickly and com|pletely
into view, whatever materials are ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. This capa|city
can ari&s;e only from <HI>imagination.</HI> In ge|neral,
penetration requires that con&s;truction
of imagination, which fits a man for fixing
his view &s;teddily on one thing, or on tho&s;e
connected with it by clo&s;e and important re|lations,
for attending to all the circum&s;tances
belonging to that thing, and, as it were, ex|hau&s;ting
its qualities. This con&s;truction of
imagination is evidently adapted to the end
of &s;cience, the inve&s;tigation of truth. For
the conclu&s;ions of &s;cience lie deep, and mu&s;t
e&s;cape the tran&s;ient glance of the &s;uperficial
ob&s;erver: they occur by our attending to &s;uch
<PB N="325" REF="332">
qualities in things as are lea&s;t &s;triking and
lea&s;t apt to force them&s;elves on our attention,
and by our pondering and contemplating in a
variety of lights, &s;uch qualities as cannot be
perfectly comprehended by a per&s;on who dwells
not on the &s;ame object for any length of time.
&mdash;Brightne&s;s of imagination is of an oppo&s;ite
nature: it is &s;uch a &s;trength of imagination
as makes every pre&s;ent object &s;ugge&s;t a mul|titude
of ideas, and hurries the mind quickly
from one thing, to others not very &s;trictly
connected with it. This character is no le&s;s
evidently accommodated to the purpo&s;e of the
arts, than penetration to that of the &s;ciences.
A quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or a copious exhibition of
different objects fit to plea&s;e, is a great mean
of producing the beauty &s;ought after in all the
arts. In poetry, for in&s;tance, the intricacy of
the fable, that is, the variety and di&s;&s;imilarity
of the incidents, and the diver&s;ity, the num|ber,
and a proper remotene&s;s of the images,
are reckoned among the &s;ure&s;t te&s;ts of real
genius.</P>
<P>IT would appear to be one con&s;equence of
what has been &s;aid, that penetration implies
an aptne&s;s to be affected only by the clo&s;e&s;t and
&s;tronge&s;t relations of things; and that bright|ne&s;s
<PB N="326" REF="333">
implies a propen&s;ity to be influenced by
&s;uch relations as are &s;lighter and more re|mote:
for the latter propen&s;ity tends to draw
off the mind to a great di&s;tance from its ob|ject;
but the former allows it to continue
nearer to it, and makes it ea&s;ier to recur quickly
to the contemplation of it. The con&s;equence
is ju&s;t; and the con&s;ideration of it will farther
determine our idea of the difference between
a genius for &s;cience and a genius for the arts.
When ideas are &s;ugge&s;ted to men of the&s;e dif|ferent
kinds of genius, by means of the &s;ame
relation, it will be found that, generally, the
ideas connected with the pre&s;ent object by the
&s;tronger degree of that relation, are &s;ugge&s;ted
to the philo&s;opher, and tho&s;e connected by the
weaker degree of it, to the arti&s;t. The former
&s;ort are tho&s;e about which the deductions of
&s;cience are commonly employed; the latter
&s;upply the decorations nece&s;&s;ary in the fine
arts. Any compari&s;on by which a philo&s;opher
would illu&s;trate or confirm a theory, mu&s;t be
&s;uch as is exactly parallel; it is enough for a
poetical compari&s;on, and even heightens its
beauty, that it agree with the &s;ubject to which
it is applied, only in &s;ome of its circum&s;tances.
When a philo&s;opher explains the cau&s;es of
<PB N="327" REF="334">
any appearance, or traces out the effects of
any principle, he proceeds regularly through
them all, according to the different degrees of
their dependence: let a poet introduce the
&s;ame &s;ubject; he will de&s;cribe, not all the
cau&s;es or effects, but &s;ome of them; he will
often omit the neare&s;t and mo&s;t direct, and
take notice only of &s;uch as are more di&s;tant
and indirect; he will not give a full delinea|tion
of any one cau&s;e or effect, but mark each
by &s;ome leading or &s;triking circum&s;tances.
The&s;e differences in manner are natural con|&s;equences
of the difference in the principles
of a&s;&s;ociation, now under con&s;ideration; and
that they take place, might be &s;hown by an
induction of many particulars. The &s;ubject
of Lucretius's poem is &s;cientifical; &s;everal of
the Epicurean theories which he de&s;cribes poe|tically,
are philo&s;ophically deduced in the
writings of the ancients: compare his account
of any part of the Epicurean &s;y&s;tem, with the
account of the &s;ame part in Cicero's philo&s;o|phical
works, for in&s;tance, and the differences
ju&s;t now remarked will appear. If in any
in&s;tances they do not appear, it will be found
either that the former is not there properly
poetical, or that the latter has dre&s;&s;ed up phi|lo&s;ophy
in a rhetorical garb approaching near
<PB N="328" REF="335">
to the poetical<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>All the&s;e ca&s;es may be exemplified in different pa&s;&s;ages of the&s;e two writers. They both give an account, for in|&s;tance, of Epicurus's doctrine concerning the motion of atoms. Lucretius's account of their moving downward, is given in a manner con&s;iderably poetical, and in which we may remark many of the peculiarities ju&s;t now mentioned, as characteri&s;|tical of genius for the arts:

<BIBL>Lib. ii. ver. 184.</BIBL></Q>
Cicero gives an account of the &s;ame doctrine, in a manner very unlike, in the &s;imple cool manner &s;uitable to &s;cience: &startq;Cen&s;et enim, eadem illa individua, et &s;olida corpora ferre &s;uo deor&s;um pondere ad lineam: hunc naturalem e&s;&s;e omnium corporum motum.&endq; <HI>De Fin.</HI> lib. i. and in &s;everal other places. The poet's account of the declination of the atoms, has little poetical in it;
<Q><L>Illud in his quoque te rebus cogno&s;cere avemus:</L>
<L>Corpora cum deor&s;um rectum per inane feruntur</L>
<L>Ponderibus propriis: incerto tempore firme,</L>
<L>Incerti&s;que locis, &s;patio &s;ecedere paullum,</L>
<L>Tantum quod nomen mutatum dicere po&s;&s;is.</L>
<L>Qod ni&s;i declinare &s;olerent, omnia deor&s;um,</L>
<L>Imbris uti guttae, caderent per inane pro&s;undum:</L>
<L>Nec foret offen&s;us natus, nec plaga creata</L>
<L>Principiis. Ita nil unquam natura crea&s;&s;et.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> ver. 216.</BIBL></Q>
and in con&s;equence of this, it differs very little from Cicero's account of the &s;ame tenet; &startq;Deinde ibidem homo acutus, cum illud occurreret, &s;i omnia deor&s;um e regione ferrentur, et, ut dixi, ad lineam, numquam fore, ut atomus altera alte|ram po&s;&s;et attingere: itaque&mdash;declinare dixit atomum perpaullum:&mdash;ita e$fici complexiones, et copulationes, et adhae&s;iones atomorum inter &s;e: ex quo efficeretur mundus, omne&s;que partes mundi, quaeque in $o $&s;&s;ent.&endq; <HI>Ibid.</HI> Many other examples might be produced.</P></NOTE>. Thom&s;on introduces &s;eve|ral
parts of the Newtonian philo&s;ophy; com|pare
his account of the&s;e with the &s;ame parts
as delivered by &s;y&s;tematic writers, and you will
find the &s;ame differences.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="336">
BUT a propen&s;ity to be affected with the
clo&s;er or the &s;lighter degrees of relation, is not
alone &s;ufficient to account for the difference
between brightne&s;s and penetration, or to ex|plain
how one genius is fit for &s;cience, and ano|ther
for the arts. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved farther,
that the peculiar predominance of &s;ome of the
a&s;&s;ociating principles contributes to form pe|netration,
and the predominance of others of
them, to form brightne&s;s of imagination; and
that in &s;everal ways.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome of the relations of things
which lead the mind more quickly, and to a
<PB N="330" REF="337">
greater di&s;tance, from the&s;e things, than other
relations would lead it: the former will by
this very circum&s;tance, according to what has
been already evinced, be mo&s;t favourable to
brightne&s;s, the latter to penetration. There
are &s;ome qualities in every object, which lay
a foundation for relations between it and
many other objects: thus the obvious &s;en&s;ible
qualities of bodies produce an infinity of re|&s;emblances
or contra&s;ts to a multitude of other
things. A &s;trong propen&s;ity to attend to the&s;e
qualities, and to be affected by the relations
corre&s;pondent to them, will be highly condu|cive
to brightne&s;s of fancy; it will produce
&s;urpri&s;ing a&s;&s;emblages, agreeable imagery, and
unexpected ornaments. But it is unfavour|able
to penetration; it produces a&s;&s;ociations
which mu&s;t lead the mind through many ob|jects
in a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, allowing it to take
but a &s;uperficial view of each. It will there|fore
contribute to penetration, at lea&s;t it will
remove one ob&s;truction to the exerci&s;e of this
power, that the imagination be not readily or
&s;trongly affected by tho&s;e &s;lighter relations
which the mo&s;t obvious qualities form among
a great multitude of things unconnected in
other re&s;pects. Accordingly, I do not &s;ay all,
but mo&s;t philo&s;ophers who were really in|ventors,
<PB N="331" REF="338">
have &s;hown no great turn for adorn|ing
their writings with &s;uch images and com|pari&s;ons
as form the graces of poetry. There
are in all objects, qualities likewi&s;e of an op|po&s;ite
kind, which do not form obvious con|nexions
between them and a multitude of
other objects. Such are the mutual influence
of the qualities of the &s;ame thing, the various
phenomena of the&s;e qualities, their cau&s;es and
their con&s;equences. The&s;e, in&s;tead of impel|ling
the mind to wander through a wide ex|tent
of things, rather confine it to one thing,
or to &s;uch as are intimately connected with it
in &s;ome important re&s;pect. A prevailing pro|pen&s;ity,
therefore, to attend chiefly to &s;uch
qualities, will not hurry the mind with rapi|dity
from one thing to others; and will there|fore
be unfavourable to brightne&s;s: but it will
leave it at lei&s;ure to dwell on its pre&s;ent ob|ject,
and di&s;po&s;e it, that it may find employ|ment,
to contemplate it in every light; and
will thus be conducive to penetration.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable likewi&s;e, that the qualities
la&s;t mentioned form the mo&s;t important and
intere&s;ting relations among things; the&s;e will,
therefore, influence the imagination and pro|mote
penetration, in much the &s;ame manner
with the &s;tronger degrees of any one relation:
<PB N="332" REF="339">
the relations which are formed by the others,
are much more trivial, and will affect the
fancy and produce brightne&s;s, in the &s;ame
manner with the &s;lighter degrees of any rela|tion.</P>
<P>THE more important relations of things,
will al&s;o be tho&s;e which lead mo&s;t naturally
to the di&s;covery of truths concerning them;
the more trivial relations are, on the other
hand, naturally adapted to amu&s;ement and
plea&s;ure, which is the object of the arts.
This difference &s;ugge&s;ts an ob&s;ervation of con|&s;iderable
con&s;equence for explaining the di&s;|tinction
between the two kinds of genius now
under con&s;ideration. We &s;hall find on exa|mination,
that tho&s;e relations which have
been already mentioned, as conducive to pe|netration
by the predominance of their in|fluence
on the imagination, are the relations
chiefly concerned in the di&s;covery of truth.
The&s;e relations are all reducible to the dif|ferent
modes of cau&s;ation and co-exi&s;tence;
and &s;ome or other of the modes of the&s;e, are
the immediate &s;ubjects of mo&s;t of the conclu|&s;ions
in the &s;everal &s;ciences. In the &s;cience
both of bodies and of the mind, the enquiry
is principally about the cau&s;es of phenomena,
their concomitants, the effects proceeding
<PB N="333" REF="340">
from cau&s;es, and the con&s;equences of general
laws. Many propo&s;itions in mathematics
regard the properties which are co-exi&s;tent in
figures and numbers, or which nece&s;&s;arily re|&s;ult
from their nature. Even when other
relations are the immediate objects of &s;cien|tifical
conclu&s;ions, yet it is chiefly by means
of cau&s;ation and co-exi&s;tence that they are
inferred. In mathematics, the proportions of
quantities and numbers are deduced as nece&s;|&s;ary
con&s;equences from principles formerly
known. In hydro&s;tatics, the &s;pecific gravi|ties
of bodies, which are properly degrees of
a common quality, are deduced from certain
effects of the weight of bodies. This being
the ca&s;e, the predominance of the&s;e relations,
cau&s;ation and co-exi&s;tence, as principles of
a&s;&s;ociation in the fancy, cannot fail to pro|duce
penetration, and to fit genius peculiarly
for the &s;ubjects of &s;cience. It directs the
mind into the very track where truth lies; it
furni&s;hes it with the very in&s;truments by
which truth may be di&s;covered.&mdash;It is no le&s;s
true, that tho&s;e which have been mentioned
as the more trivial relations, and by their
prevalence conducive to brightne&s;s, or &s;ome
of them at lea&s;t, are mo&s;t adapted to the ob|ject
and the end of the arts. The fine arts
<PB N="334" REF="341">
are commonly called imitative: were they all
purely and totally &s;uch, there could be no
difficulty in pronouncing that re&s;emblance is
the relation which would lead fancy to con|trive
works of art. In painting, for in&s;tance,
which is &s;trictly imitative, the figures, the
attitudes, the expre&s;&s;ion, the colouring, are
but &s;o many means of rendering the picture a
ju&s;t and &s;triking repre&s;entation of the &s;tandard,
whether actual or ideal, which the arti&s;t had
in view; and the conception of this &s;tandard
&s;ugge&s;ts them all to the fancy by the a&s;&s;ociat|ing
principle of re&s;emblance. But even in
ca&s;es where the arts are lea&s;t imitative, it will
appear on attention that this principle is pre|dominant
A di&s;covery in &s;cience is &s;ome|times
de&s;cribed poetically: &s;uch a de&s;cription
will, perhaps more clearly and &s;trikingly than
any other in&s;tance, &s;how how much poetry is
employed about re&s;emblances, and con&s;e|quently
how e&s;&s;ential it is to poetic genius,
that this be the predominant principle of a&s;&s;o|ciation.

<P>WHATEVER relation is the predominant
principle of a&s;&s;ociation in a particular per&s;on,
<PB N="336" REF="343">
that per&s;on is always di&s;po&s;ed to fix his atten|tion
chiefly on tho&s;e qualities in objects which
lay a foundation for that relation; and he is
di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider every quality in the light
in which it is fitte&s;t for &s;ugge&s;ting ideas by
means of that relation<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See above, Part II. &s;ect. 7.</NOTE>. This di&s;po&s;ition
is, perhaps, one cau&s;e of the predominance
of a particular a&s;&s;ociating principle: it cer|tainly
adds to the force of the predominant
principle, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts it in forming a corre&s;pon|dent
turn of genius. The man, for in&s;tance,
who&s;e imagination is under the influence of
cau&s;ation and co-exi&s;tence, not only &s;trongly
feels the force of the&s;e relations when they
are perceived, but is al&s;o prone to perceive
them, prone to con&s;ider every object before
him, in that attitude in which it can mo&s;t
readily &s;ugge&s;t its cau&s;es, its effects, its con|comitants,
and the like. This will contri|bute
very much to render his genius pene|trating;
both to direct it to the inve&s;tigations
which belong to &s;cience, and to fit it to enter
deeply into them. He is continually bu&s;y in
turning every object that comes in his way,
to &s;ome u&s;e in the di&s;covery of truth. He
has the &s;ame advantage for invention, that
the merchant who is intent on every oppor|tunity
<PB N="337" REF="344">
of gain, has for enriching him&s;elf.
Ju&s;t &s;o, if re&s;emblance be the predominant
principle of a&s;&s;ociation, the mind, continually
in &s;earch of re&s;emblances, will eagerly &s;et
every object in &s;uch a point of view that it
may &s;ugge&s;t them; and con&s;equently it will
be &s;ucce&s;sful in finding them out, and exhi|biting
them, as well as &s;trongly affected by
them when they are found. The colours of
light refracted by the pri&s;m, have been ob|&s;erved
by the poet, as well as by the philo&s;o|pher
but they are con&s;idered by the&s;e in dif|ferent
points of view, lead them into very
different trains of thinking, and are applied
to very different purpo&s;es. Pope applies them
as an image for illu&s;trating a re&s;embling &s;ub|ject,
and is led away quickly from the contem|plation
of them to that &s;ubject;
<Q><L>Fal&s;e eloquence, like the pri&s;matic gla&s;s,</L>
<L>Its gaudy colours &s;preads on ev'ry place;</L>
<L>The face of Nature we no more &s;urvey,</L>
<L>All glares alike, without di&s;tinction gay:</L>
<L>But true expre&s;&s;ion, like th' unchanging &s;un,</L>
<L>Clears and improves whate'er it &s;hines upon,</L>
<L>It gilds all objects, but it alters none<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m, ver. 311&mdash;318.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation of them gave Newton's mind
a very different impul&s;e: his attention was
<PB N="338" REF="345">
fixt upon the&s;e colours them&s;elves; he con&s;i|dered
them as an effect which requires a &s;uit|able
cau&s;e, and was led to contrive a curious
&s;et of experiments for a&s;certaining that cau&s;e.
Some of the&s;e experiments exhibit phenome|na
which the poet might de&s;cribe for their
own &s;akes, or the painter find an occa&s;ion to
repre&s;ent on canva&s;s: but Newton attended
only to tho&s;e circum&s;tances which indicated
&s;ome of the laws of light and colours; and
how &s;trongly he was impelled to attend to
the&s;e, any per&s;on may judge by recollecting
what a prodigious number of appearances and
circum&s;tances, minute in them&s;elves, and,
ab&s;tracted from the inve&s;tigation in which he
was engaged, unimportant and unintere&s;ting,
he took notice of, and delineated with &s;cru|pulous
exactne&s;s, in his &s;everal experiments.</P>
<P>INDEED, as we ob&s;erved formerly<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Part II. &s;ect. 7.</NOTE>, no
one principle of a&s;&s;ociation is &s;ufficient for
invention on any &s;ubject, alone, or without
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other principles, acting in
&s;ubordination to it. On this account, the
predominance of re&s;emblance, or of cau&s;ation
and co-exi&s;tence, appropriates genius to the
arts or to the &s;ciences, not merely by the ex|ertion
of the&s;e principles them&s;elves, but al&s;o
<PB N="339" REF="346">
by determining other a&s;&s;ociating principles to
act in &s;ub&s;ervience to them. There are two
ways in which one a&s;&s;ociating principle may
make others act in &s;ub&s;ervience to it.</P>
<P>FIRST, It may determine them to &s;ugge&s;t
chiefly &s;uch ideas as are &s;uitable to it, and ap|plicable
to its purpo&s;es. Very various ideas
are connected with any pre&s;ent object by the
&s;ame relation; all the&s;e are in them&s;elves
equally fit to be &s;ugge&s;ted by that object: but
if &s;ome of them corre&s;pond to the predomi|nant
principle of a&s;&s;ociation, or to the de&s;ign
which it leads a per&s;on to propo&s;e and to keep
in view, the&s;e will be introduced in prefer|ence
to others which have no &s;uch corre&s;pon|dence.
A double relation belongs to them,
and draws them into view by a double power.
The &s;ubordinate principles exert them&s;elves
by their own force; but the predominant one
gives their exertions a particular direction;
it likewi&s;e makes them, in that direction, act
with greater vigour than they would in any
other; it, as it were, infu&s;es its own &s;pirit into
them. In genius for the arts, re&s;emblance,
the predominant principle of a&s;&s;ociation,
continually operates along with all the other
principles, and, by uniting its force to theirs,
cau&s;es them &s;ugge&s;t only, and &s;ugge&s;t quickly,
<PB N="340" REF="347">
&s;uch ideas as are conducive to the imitation or
repre&s;entation which the arti&s;t has in view.
The attributes, qualities, and circum&s;tances
of any &s;ubject, are connected with it by co-exi&s;tence,
and are naturally &s;ugge&s;ted to the
imagination by this relation: the predomi|nance
of re&s;emblance as an a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciple
in the poet or the painter, will make
the&s;e to be &s;ugge&s;ted, whenever they are ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for marking di&s;tinctly the object which
he de&s;cribes or repre&s;ents; and it will make
tho&s;e of them to occur mo&s;t readily which are
propere&s;t for this purpo&s;e, even though they
be in them&s;elves remote. Nealces painting a
naval engagement between the Egyptians and
the Per&s;ians, and wanting to intimate that it
had happened on the Nile, the waters of
which are of the &s;ame colour with the &s;ea,
contrived to accompli&s;h his aim, by drawing
an a&s;s drinking on the banks, and a crocodile
endeavouring to &s;urprize him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Siquidem cum praelium navale Aegyptiorum et Per&s;arum pi$xi&s;&s;et&punc; quod in Nilo, cujus aqua e&s;t mari &s;imilis, factum volebat intelligi; argumentoque declaravit, quod arte non poterat: a&s;ellum enim in li$tore bibentem pinxit, et crocodi|lum in&s;idiantem ci. PLIN. <HI>Nat. Ht&s;t.</HI> lib. xxxy. cap. 10.</NOTE>. In every
good picture, in every good poetical de&s;crip|tion,
we perceive the influence of co-exi&s;tence
operating on the imagination, under the di|rection.
<PB N="341" REF="348">
of re&s;emblance: whenever it does not
operate, preci&s;ion is wanting, nothing is ap|propriated,
every thing is common and inde|terminate;
whenever it is not directed by
re&s;emblance, there are &s;uperfluous, u&s;ele&s;s, or
ill-adapted circum&s;tances. A defect in the
former re&s;pect, produces poverty of genius;
a defect in the latter re&s;pect, irregularity.
Both defects are ob&s;ervable in &s;ome works
even of the mo&s;t ingenious arti&s;ts, and are
acknowledged to take &s;omething from their
merit, and to indicate a failure in the exer|tion
of genius. It has often been remarked
as a blemi&s;h in Pope's Wind&s;or Fore&s;t, and it
has &s;ometimes been urged as a proof of his
not having much genius for de&s;criptive poe|try,
that he de&s;cribes rural beauty in general,
rather than the peculiarities of that place;
the apology made for him by his advocates&punc;
that the place had at that time few peculiar
beauties, &s;uppo&s;es the ju&s;tne&s;s of the prin|ciple
on which the remark proceeds, and, if
it be allowed, will imply that the &s;ubject was
ill-cho&s;en for a di&s;play of poetic genius; and
will thus confirm the ob&s;ervation which we
have made. Cowley's poem <HI>On the Queen's
repairing Somer&s;et-hou&s;e</HI> is rather a minute
delineation of its &s;ituation and the objects
<PB N="342" REF="349">
&s;urrounding it, than a poetical de&s;cription by
a proper &s;election of its beauties. Every epi|thet
which is as applicable to almo&s;t any other
&s;ubject as to that to which it is applied, every
de&s;cription which is vague and not charac|teri&s;tical
of its original, every character that
is not di&s;tinctly marked, is an in&s;tance of
the former defect in genius. Every circum|&s;tance
in a de&s;cription which counteracts the
effect of the whole, or even which contributes
nothing to it, every incident not &s;ufficiently
connected with the main &s;ubject, is an in&s;tance
of the latter. Either of the&s;e defects, if it
be great and permanent, is acknowledged to
be incon&s;i&s;tent with any con&s;iderable degree of
real genius.&mdash;What has been &s;aid concerning
co-exi&s;tence, may be ea&s;ily applied to all the
other relations. For in&s;tance, no perform|ance
in any of the arts, can be carried on
without the introduction of cau&s;es and of
effects; it is often by means of the&s;e that the
&s;ubjects are marked, and a di&s;tinct re&s;emblance
or repre&s;entation of them produced. The
principle of re&s;emblance, keeping the arti&s;t
intent on the production of this, will render
cau&s;ation active in &s;ugge&s;ting ideas conducive
to it; we &s;hall perceive in his work many
illu&s;trations of things by their cau&s;es or their
<PB N="343" REF="350">
con&s;equences, which &s;how that the a&s;&s;ociating
principle of cau&s;ation has been very active;
and we &s;hall perceive the fitne&s;s of them all
for giving a preci&s;e and lively conception of
the object, which &s;hows that its activity was
influenced and directed by re&s;emblance. In
con&s;equence of both the&s;e circum&s;tances, the
piece is both rich and correct. In the greate&s;t
part of poetical de&s;criptions, one principal
means of conveying a &s;triking de&s;cription,
is the &s;ugge&s;tion of cau&s;es or effects: in the
very fir&s;t de&s;cription in Thom&s;on's Spring,
it is almo&s;t the only means employed;
<Q><L>And &s;ee where &s;urly Winter pa&s;&s;es off</L>
<L>Far to the north, and calls his ruffian bla&s;ts:</L>
<L>His bla&s;ts obey, and quit the howling hill,</L>
<L>The &s;hattered fore&s;t, and the ravag'd vale;</L>
<L>While &s;ofter gales &s;ucceed, at who&s;e kind touch,</L>
<L>Di&s;&s;olving &s;nows in livid torrents lo&s;t,</L>
<L>The mountains lift their green heads to the &s;ky<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ver. 11&mdash;17.</NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>In like manner, the predominance of re&s;em|blance
makes contrariety to &s;ugge&s;t, not any
ideas which happen to bear that relation to
the pre&s;ent object, but &s;uch as form contra&s;ts
and oppo&s;itions fit to render the conception
of it clearer and more &s;triking. All the con|tra&s;ts
which are approved, in painting, in
<PB N="344" REF="351">
mu&s;ic, or in poetry, are &s;uch as contribute to
this purpo&s;e. As it is thus e&s;&s;ential to genius
for the arts, that all the a&s;&s;ociating principles
act in &s;ubordination to re&s;emblance, &s;o their
acting in this &s;ubordination, with vigour and
quickne&s;s, mu&s;t contribute greatly to bright|ne&s;s
and richne&s;s of imagination: they are
like a multitude of &s;ervants, bu&s;ied in provid|ing
abundance of all things for their prince.
The degree of perfection in genius, will al|ways
be proportioned to the vigour of all the
a&s;&s;ociating principles, and the &s;trictne&s;s of
their &s;ubjection to the leading one.</P>
<P>AFTER what has been &s;aid, it will be ea&s;y
to explain, how cau&s;ation and co-exi&s;tence,
the one or the other of which is always the
predominant principle of a&s;&s;ociation in &s;cien|tific
genius, determine all the other principles
to introduce &s;uch ideas as lead to the di&s;covery
of truth, and, by imparting vigour to them
while they act in this direction, enable them
to introduce &s;uch ideas readily and in abun|dance.
It will be &s;ufficient to illu&s;trate this,
with re&s;pect to one principle of a&s;&s;ociation.
In every &s;ort of &s;cientific genius, re&s;emblance
mu&s;t have con&s;iderable influence on the ima|gination;
in mathematics, &s;imilitude of ratios
is often a means of invention; in philo&s;ophy,
<PB N="345" REF="352">
one experiment &s;ugge&s;ts others which have a
likene&s;s to it, and one conclu&s;ion leads to ano|ther
analogous conclu&s;ion. The pre&s;ent ob|ject
might &s;ugge&s;t many others, by means of
their re&s;emblance to it, which would contri|ribute
nothing to a new di&s;covery: it is when
the predominant principle of a&s;&s;ociation, act|ing
powerfully on a per&s;on, fixes his atten|tion
on the reference of the pre&s;ent object to
the di&s;covery of a particular truth, and, in
con&s;equence of this, makes it &s;ugge&s;t only
&s;uch, from among the &s;imilar objects, as have
the &s;ame reference, that the principle of re|&s;emblance
promotes penetration, and contri|butes
to the fertility of &s;cientific genius. Ex|periments
in electricity have gradually and
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;ugge&s;ted a great multitude of
other experiments on the &s;ame &s;ubject; all
the&s;e experiments have been frequently re|peated
by many per&s;ons; the &s;everal circum|&s;tances
of them have been accurately ob&s;erved
and recorded; and they have been &s;urpri&s;|ingly
varied: but very many of them &s;erve
only to diver&s;ify the appearances, to a&s;toni&s;h
or amu&s;e, but lead not to any di&s;covery con|cerning
the nature, the cau&s;e, or the laws of
electricity. Some of tho&s;e who have made
the mo&s;t experiments, deduced no general
<PB N="346" REF="353">
conclu&s;ions from them, or were inaccurate
and erroneous in tho&s;e which they attempted
to deduce: they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a con&s;iderable
degree of &s;trength, the a&s;&s;ociating principle
of re&s;emblance, and tho&s;e other a&s;&s;ociating
principles which were nece&s;&s;ary for leading
them from one experiment to another, and
for enabling them to contrive and conduct
experiments, but they were defective in tho&s;e
principles of a&s;&s;ociation which mu&s;t be predo|minant
in order to form a genius for &s;cienti|fical
deductions, and without acting in &s;ub|ordination
to which, the&s;e former cannot pro|mote
this purpo&s;e. Others have deduced
&s;ome general conclu&s;ions from &s;ome of their
experiments, but have likewi&s;e made many
experiments which tend to no &s;uch conclu|&s;ions:
in them the principles of a&s;&s;ociation
which mu&s;t take the lead in forming &s;cien|tific
genius, have had &s;ome degree of force,
yet not force enough to render them uni|formly
and habitually predominant; and in
con&s;equence of this the other a&s;&s;ciating prin|ciples
have acted in &s;ubordination to them,
only in &s;ome in&s;tances, not con&s;tantly or in
all their experiments. There is no electrician
who has di&s;played a greater &s;hare of real &s;ci|entific
genius, than Franklin. His experi|ments
<PB N="347" REF="354">
are not &s;o numerous as tho&s;e of many
others: this proceeds not from an inferiority
to any, in the &s;pecies of ingenuity requi&s;ite
for contriving and conducting experiments;
on the contrary in all his experiments there is
a peculiar neatne&s;s, beauty, and variety; but
it proceeds from his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the a&s;&s;ociating
principle of cau&s;ation in very great vigour,
&s;o that it con&s;tantly exerts it&s;elf, and makes
all the other a&s;&s;ociating principles act in per|fect
&s;ub&s;ervience to it. Accordingly there is
&s;carce one of his experiments &s;uperfluous,
unmeaning, or indefinite; they all contribute
to e&s;tabli&s;h general conclu&s;ions, they are un|dertaken
with this view, and they are con|ducted
in the manner fitte&s;t for accompli&s;hing
it. His experiments for in&s;tance on the
Leyden phial, are a regularly connected &s;eries
&s;it for e&s;tabli&s;hing the difference between po|&s;itive

for &s;etting them in &s;uch lights as may render
them mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient both to the contrivance
of new experiments and to the deduction of
new conclu&s;ions. The effect of pointed

by that a&s;&s;ociating principle which in|&s;tigates
to the inve&s;tigation of them, putting
in motion all the other principles which lead
to the means of pro&s;ecuting that inve&s;tigation,
and making them operate with vigour in the
u&s;e of the&s;e means<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Facts amply &s;ufficient for &s;upporting all the ob&s;ervations made in this illu&s;tration, will be found in PRIESTLY'S <HI>Hi&s;tory of Electricity,</HI> Part 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, As each of the a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciples
is &s;u&s;ceptible of various modifications<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See Part II. &s;ect. 6.</NOTE>,
the predominant principle may make the re&s;t
act in &s;ubordination to it&s;elf, by di&s;po&s;ing us
to be affected by tho&s;e modifications of them,
which are mo&s;t coincident with it, and fitte&s;t
for promoting its de&s;igns. This &s;eems to be
one of the chief ways in which the predomi|nant
principle determines any other principle
<PB N="349" REF="356">
to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome ideas in preference to others;
and therefore the taking notice of it, &s;erves
to explain farther the ob&s;ervations made un|der
the la&s;t head. When we con&s;ider how
many and how di&s;&s;imilar modifications every
a&s;&s;ociating principle admits, we mu&s;t, be &s;en|&s;ible
that the power of the predominant prin|ciple
to modify the others &s;uitably to its own
de&s;igns, will introduce great variety into their
effects, and give birth to very different kinds
of genius. Re&s;emblance, for in&s;tance, which
is the leading in&s;trument of invention in the
arts, is often a &s;ubordinate in&s;trument of in|vention
in &s;cience. But re&s;emblance is of
very different kinds. The re&s;emblances which
influence the poet or the painter, are for the
mo&s;t part &s;uch as belong to the &s;en&s;ible qua|lities
or the general appearances of things,
&s;uch as are &s;triking, and &s;uch as the arti&s;t can
make to be ea&s;ily and &s;trongly conceived by
others. Such re&s;emblances are of little con|&s;equence
in the inve&s;tigations of &s;cience, and
have little influence on the imagination of
the philo&s;opher. It is his aim to di&s;cover
cau&s;es, laws, or effects: intent on this, he
ob&s;erves, and is affected by, &s;uch &s;imilitudes
as regard the manner of conducting experi|ments,
&s;uch as are indications of things pro|ceeding
<PB N="350" REF="357">
from the &s;ame cau&s;es with the pre&s;ent
object, or from &s;imilar cau&s;es, of their being
produced in the &s;ame manner, of their having
&s;imilar con&s;equences, or of their bearing
&s;imilar relations to any object, and the like.
Such &s;orts of re&s;emblance are congruous to
the predominant principle of cau&s;ation; they
are &s;ub&s;ervient to its operations; they are the
&s;orts which make one proportion, one expe|riment,
or one conclu&s;ion &s;ugge&s;t others:
and that principle cau&s;es the&s;e, rather than
other &s;orts of re&s;emblance, to act vigorou&s;ly
and pour in ideas upon the mind. One can
conceive many objects which the appearances
of light refracted by the pri&s;in, would have
naturally &s;ugge&s;ted to a poet; but they would
have all been &s;uch as bear &s;ome re&s;emblance
or analogy to the&s;e appearances them&s;elves.
The pri&s;matic experiments &s;ugge&s;ted to New|ton
other experiments or ob&s;ervations on
bubbles and plates of air, of gla&s;s, and of
water, on &s;peculums, on heated &s;teel, melted
metals, coloured powders, &s;alts, vitriols, al|lum,
borax, nitre, comphire, diamonds, and
a great variety of other &s;ub&s;tances. None of
them would have come within the range of
poetical genius; &s;ome of them are too ex|actly
&s;imilar to &s;erve for images or compa|ri&s;ons,
<PB N="351" REF="358">
others are too remote to be applicable,
in their obvious appearance, to the purpo&s;e
of illu&s;tration, others have nothing fit to &s;trike
the fancy, or to promote the poet's views:
but they were the very trials applicable to
Newton's de&s;ign; and his predominant prin|ciple
of a&s;&s;ociation, keeping that de&s;ign fix|edly
in his view, excited and gave vigour to
the &s;orts of re&s;emblance which could &s;ugge&s;t
objects &s;ub&s;ervient to it. In like manner, the
relation of cau&s;e and effect, which is a lead|ing
principle of a&s;&s;ociation to the philo&s;opher,
is very often employed by the arti&s;t as a &s;ub|ordinate
principle; and, by being in him
&s;ubordinate, it is modified in particular ways:
he is influenced, not by every &s;pecies of it,
but by tho&s;e &s;pecies which can enliven or de|fine
the repre&s;entation of an object. The
philo&s;opher is affected, for in&s;tance, by the
clo&s;er and more proper kinds of cau&s;ation;
the&s;e alone are of u&s;e in his de&s;igns: the poet
is mo&s;t frequently affected by the le&s;s proper
kinds, and the remoter degrees of this rela|tion;
the&s;e are generally the fitte&s;t for enter|ing
into &s;triking de&s;criptions. This will al&s;o
hold true of co-exi&s;tence; it is of little u&s;e to
the philo&s;opher, and is little employed by
him, except in its &s;tricte&s;t forms; it is u&s;ed
<PB N="352" REF="359">
by the arti&s;t in all its forms, chiefly in &s;uch
as are more loo&s;e. Contrariety is employed
both in &s;cience and in the arts, as a &s;ubordi|nate
principle of a&s;&s;ociation; but different
kinds of it operate in the&s;e two &s;ubjects, ac|cording
to their congruity to the predomi|nant
principle in each, and their &s;ub&s;ervience
to the re&s;pective ends of each. The philo&s;o|pher
is influenced chiefly by contrarieties in
the cau&s;es and the effects of things; a genius
for the arts, though not in&s;en&s;ible to the&s;e,
is al&s;o, and perhaps more, affected by oppo|&s;itions
and contra&s;ts in the appearances of
things them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THUS in every kind of genius, the prin|ciple
of a&s;&s;ociation which is in that kind pre|dominant
keeps the end in view, renders the
mind intent upon it, gives it a di&s;po&s;ition to
run into what can promote it, and to reject
what is un&s;erviceable for it: by means of all
this, that predominant principle gives all the
other principles a propen&s;ity to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch
ideas, and to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch forms as are mo&s;t
coincident with it, and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to
the end of the work. In every kind of ge|nius,
all the a&s;&s;ociating principles mu&s;t ope|rate
vigorou&s;ly: but the predominant prin|ciple
operates by its own inherent vigour,
<PB N="353" REF="360">
like the &s;un which &s;hines with his own light;
and the &s;ubordinate principles may be com|pared
to the moon, which &s;hines with bor|rowed
light, and reflects it only on that &s;ide
which is turned to the &s;un; they have their
vigour imparted to them by the predominant
principle, and they act in a direction &s;uitable
to it. It will confirm the ju&s;tne&s;s of this
di&s;tinction, and farther illu&s;trate our &s;ubject,
to ob&s;erve, That the con&s;ant operation of
the predominant principle along with the
&s;ubordinate ones, is always clearly perceiv|able,
not only in the &s;ub&s;ervience which it
gives the&s;e to its de&s;igns, but al&s;o in the &s;e|parate
effects which it produces. Let one
experiment, for in&s;tance, &s;ugge&s;t a &s;imilar
one to a philo&s;opher, he not only applies it
to the inve&s;tigation in which he was profe&s;&s;|edly
engaged; but, if it &s;ugge&s;t any other
conclu&s;ions by means of any of its circum|&s;tances,
he readily takes notice of them al&s;o,
and thus &s;hows how much and how uninter|ruptedly
the relation of cau&s;e and effect influ|ences
his imagination. Innumerable in&s;tances
of the imagination being in this manner in|fluenced,
might be collected from the works
of philo&s;ophers. To hint but at a very few;
Newton re&s;ted not in applying his optical
<PB N="354" REF="361">
experiments to the di&s;covery of the proper|ties
of light and colours, which was his im|mediate
view in making them, but con&s;idered
al&s;o how they might be applied to the expli|cation
of animal motion, attraction, and other
phenomena<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Optics, <HI>Qu.</HI> 24. 31, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Wheeler having found by
experiments, that bodies to which electricity
is communicated, repel one another, was led
by the circum&s;tances of the&s;e experiments, to
ob&s;erve, that it &s;ugge&s;ts a rea&s;on for a very
different phenomenon, for the di&s;&s;olution of
bodies in men&s;trua, viz. that the particles of
the &s;olvend, having imbibed particles of the
men&s;truum, &s;o as to be &s;aturated with them,
the &s;aturated particles become repul&s;ive of
one another, &s;eparate and fly to pieces<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">PRIESTLY'S <HI>Hi&s;t. of Electricity,</HI> Part I. per. 4.</NOTE>.
De&s;aguliers was led in like manner to think
of transferring the re&s;ult of his electrical ex|periments,
to account for the fixing of air by
&s;teams of &s;ulphur, and for the a&s;cent of va|pours<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>per.</HI> 6.</NOTE>.
And later electricians have thought
of applying their experiments and conclu|&s;ions
to account, not only for thunder, light|ning,
and meteors, but al&s;o for water-&s;pouts,
hurricanes, and earthquakes<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> per. 10. &s;ect. 12.</NOTE>. A poet
<PB N="355" REF="362">
&s;ometimes introduces a &s;eries of cau&s;es and
effects; but he always de&s;cribes them in a
manner different from the philo&s;opher: how
much his imagination is under the power of
re&s;emblance, appears from his illu&s;trating
every part of the de&s;cription by epithets,
images, metaphors, and compari&s;ons. The
pa&s;&s;age already quoted from Thom&s;on, con|cerning
the pri&s;matic image, may &s;erve as an
illu&s;tration of this. Many other examples
might be produced<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><P>Many pa&s;&s;ages in Lucretius, of which the &s;ubject is purely &s;cientifical, are in this manner rendered beautifully poetical.

ONE remarkable difference between the
two kinds of genius, remains yet to be men|tioned.
In &s;cientifical inve&s;tigations, the
imagination can receive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the
pa&s;&s;ions: few pa&s;&s;ions can mix with the&s;e in|ve&s;tigations;
and if the&s;e few were allowed
to interfere, they would infect our conclu|&s;ions,
and ob&s;truct our di&s;coveries. Where
truth is the object, the pa&s;&s;ions can produce
only prejudices fit to lead away from it. But
genius for the arts can never exi&s;t where the
pa&s;&s;ions have not great power over the imagi|nation,
in affecting the train and a&s;&s;ociation
of perceptions. An imagination ea&s;ily af|fected
by the pa&s;&s;ions, is peculiar to genius
for the arts; and it is e&s;&s;ential to it in all the
forms which it can a&s;&s;ume. There is &s;carce
any of the fine arts which is not &s;u&s;ceptible
of the pathetic, and in which the pathetic is
<PB N="357" REF="364">
not a capital excellence. In painting, in
mu&s;ic, in poetry, in eloquence, it is often
nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions and affections
of the &s;oul: they can be expre&s;&s;ed only by
the per&s;on who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility of heart enables
him to conceive the pa&s;&s;ion with vivacity, to
catch it as by infection, and who&s;e imagina|tion
immediately receives an impul&s;e from it,
and pours in the ideas of the proper charac|ters
of the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions, of tho&s;e effects,
imitable in the particular art, by which each
pa&s;&s;ion naturally &s;hows it&s;elf. Every arti&s;t
mu&s;t often excite the pa&s;&s;ions: they are ex|cited
chiefly by being well expre&s;&s;ed: they
are excited al&s;o by &s;trong repre&s;entations of
their objects and their cau&s;es; but it is the
fancy, excited by the lively conception of the
pa&s;&s;ion, running into the &s;ame thoughts
which the pa&s;&s;ion, if really working, would
&s;ugge&s;t, and placing the arti&s;t in the &s;ituation
in which he would then be, that puts it in
his power to imagine, and con&s;equently to
repre&s;ent, its cau&s;es and its objects in a way
proper for infu&s;ing it into others<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Summa enim (quantum ego quidem &s;entio) circa mo|vendos affectus in ho$ po&s;ita e&s;t, ut moveamur ip&s;i.&mdash;Nec incendit ni&s;i ignis, nec made&s;cimus ni&s;i humore: nec res ulla dat alteri colorem, quem ip&s;a non habet.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the two Kinds of Genius differ in re&s;pect
of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance which they derive from
Memory</HEAD>
<P>BOTH in genius for the arts, and in ge|nius
for &s;cience, imagination is a&s;&s;i&s;ted
by memory, operating in &s;ubordination to it,
and operating continually along with it. But
it is not, in the&s;e two kinds, a&s;&s;i&s;ted equally
by memory, nor a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;ame &s;pecies
of memory.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="366">
IN &s;cientifical invention, memory is exerted
in a much greater degree, and its a&s;&s;i&s;tance is
more indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary than in the arts.
All the experiments, all the ob&s;ervations, all
the principles, employed in philo&s;ophical in|ve&s;tigations,
mu&s;t be &s;uch as have been actu|ally
ob&s;erved or a&s;certained, and are exactly
remembered, el&s;e they can be of no u&s;e for
e&s;tabli&s;hing a ju&s;t theory. Memory mu&s;t at|te&s;t
the phenomena as really ob&s;erved, and the
principles as already verified, and produce a
full conviction of their having been ob&s;erved
and verified, el&s;e the philo&s;opher would never
think of applying them to the &s;upport of his
theory. Phenomena not experienced, but ima|gined,
could lead to none but chimerical con|clu&s;ions.
At one time electricians imagined
that they &s;aw in their experiments the power
of electricity affected by the colours of bodies,
and light bodies performing a regular motion
from we&s;t to ca&s;t round an electrified ball<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PRIESTLY'S <HI>Hi&s;tory of Electricity,</HI> Part I. per. v.</NOTE>:
had the&s;e facts been taken for granted, and
conclu&s;ions deduced from them, the conclu|&s;ions
mu&s;t have been altogether fanciful.
Often indeed men can in &s;ome degree imagine
beforehand what will be the re&s;ult of an ex|periment,
or what the appearances which it
<PB N="360" REF="367">
will di&s;clo&s;e; may, cannot re&s;train them&s;elves
from conjectures concerning this. But it is
only intimate acquaintance with the &s;ubject,
exten&s;ive knowlege of the laws of nature, ac|curate
remembrance of the appearances which
have attended analogous experiments, di&s;cern|ment
of the variation of circum&s;tances in the
experiment propo&s;ed, and judgment of the
probable con&s;equences of that variation, that
can enable them to conjecture right. Some
of Bacon's anticipations, and many of New|ton's
conjectures in his queries, were ju&s;t, and
have been &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed by actual trials.
But if, without the&s;e requi&s;ites, by the mere
force of imagination, a per&s;on venture to gue&s;s
in this manner, he will almo&s;t certainly gue&s;s
wrong; and, if he proceed to rea&s;on from it,
will produce a fanta&s;tical hypothe&s;is. Scarce
any man can po&s;&s;e&s;s the requi&s;ites mentioned,
in &s;o great a degree, as to render it &s;afe for
him to build upon the &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;ult, with|out
fir&s;t bringing it to actual trial, and making
him&s;elf certain of the fact. Even when a
man may naturally think that he has the be&s;t
foundation for his conjecture, the re&s;ult may,
on trial, turn out not only different, but di|rectly
oppo&s;ite. When all the experiments
at that time made &s;eemed to &s;how, that the
<PB N="361" REF="368">
electrical fire is contained in the gla&s;s it&s;elf,
and when it was known that the earth or a
floor draws off this fire from a globe or tube
in which it has been excited, it was natural
to conjecture that the electrical power would
be &s;trengthened by preventing its being thus
drawn off, by &s;upporting the machine and the
operator on &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance which is not a con|ductor
of electricity; the conjecture was
formed by &s;everal electricians, and was in the
highe&s;t degree plau&s;ible: but when they made
the trial, the very rever&s;e of their expectation
happened, the power was very much weak|ened;
and this unlooked for effect led &s;ome
of them to correct the &s;pecious error which
had occa&s;ioned their conjecture, to conclude
that the electric fire is only collected, not pro|duced,
in the gla&s;s by friction, and to di&s;cover
the twofold electricity, the po&s;itive and the
negative<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">PRIESTLY'S <HI>Hi&s;t. of Electricity,</HI> Part I. per. vii. and per. viii. &s;ect. 3.</NOTE>. Facts imagined, or ra&s;hly taken

in &s;cience. All the facts on which true &s;ci|ence
can be built, mu&s;t be exhibited by me|mory;
the operation by which they are im|mediately
applied, is recollection. This re|collection
is indeed under the influence of a
<PB N="362" REF="369">
piercing imagination. Imagination excited by
a pre&s;ent perception, puts us upon &s;earching
for the proper experiments and ob&s;ervations;
it is often by relations fit to affect it&s;elf alone,
that it gives us the fir&s;t hint of the&s;e, but me|mory
is the power which it &s;ends, as it were,
in &s;earch of them, and by means of which it
finds them. Imagination in&s;tigates us to recol|lection,

It is the only guide to <HI>truth,</HI> the
object and the end of &s;cience.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;o in the arts. When the painter
draws a figure or a land&s;cape, when the poet
conceives a de&s;cription, a character, or an
event, it may be &s;uch as he has really ob|&s;erved,
and remembers, and may be only by
fancy drawn out of the repo&s;itory of memory,
and applied in the proper place. But it is not
of importance whether it be or not; its be|ing
atte&s;ted by memory, its being exactly like
to &s;omething ob&s;erved, are not the circum|&s;tances
to which the arti&s;t principally attends;
though it has never been ob&s;erved, it may be
productive of <HI>beauty,</HI> and this is all that is re|quired
in the arts. Human invention is not

&s;ufficiently, without ever employing

from the reality of things, which would di&s;|grace
&s;cience, and be ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent
with its genuine end, contribute to perfection
in the arts.</P>
<P>GENIUS for &s;cience and genius for the arts,
are likewi&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ted, principally, by different
&s;pecies of memory. A capacity of &s;trongly
remembering &s;eparate objects, is far from be|ing
unnece&s;&s;ary in the inve&s;tigations of &s;ci|ence:
many of the phenomena which Nature
exhibits, or which experiments di&s;clo&s;e, are
&s;imple objects; and every phenomena mu&s;t
be attended to and retained, el&s;e the con&s;e|quence
will be, either that no conclu&s;ion can
be formed, or that the conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be
wrong. But a turn for accurately remem|bering
the connexions of things is likewi&s;e
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and of capital import|ance.
To retain lively ideas of the &s;everal
&s;eparate appearances, will contribute little
to promote &s;cience, except we al&s;o have ob|&s;erved
and remember the preci&s;e &s;ituation in
which the appearances occurred, all the cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="365" REF="372">
which attended them, what ap|pearances
preceded, what were con&s;equent,
and what contemporary, how they came on,
varied, and again went off. That fluids a&s;cend
in exhau&s;ted tubes, was always known; but
no legitimate conclu&s;ion could be drawn from
this appearance, as long as it was taken for
granted that they would a&s;cend to any height:
it was only when the exact heights to which
they ri&s;e were ob&s;erved, that a di&s;covery was
made of the cau&s;e of their a&s;cent, the pre&s;&s;ure
of the air; a di&s;covery which has led for|ward
to many others both curious and u&s;eful.
Phenomena imperfectly ob&s;erved, can produce
no ju&s;t conclu&s;ions; and a confu&s;ed or im|perfect
remembrance of phenomena, will ob|&s;truct
the ju&s;tne&s;s of the conclu&s;ions, as much,
and in the &s;ame ways, as if &s;ome of their e&s;|&s;ential
circum&s;tances had been wholly over|looked.</P>
<P>IN the arts, the memory of &s;eparate objects
mu&s;t be very &s;trong and lively: the arti&s;t mu&s;t
conceive them &s;trikingly, that he may be able
to repre&s;ent them &s;trikingly, Memory of the
connexions of things is often of great utility:
but it is not always ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to re|tain
all their real connexions with preci&s;ion.
<PB N="366" REF="373">
Even in a profe&s;&s;ed imitation of a real object,
a full and minute exhibition of all its circum|&s;tances
is not in&s;i&s;ted upon; a &s;election of
&s;uch as, according to the art by which the
imitation is made, will produce the greate&s;t
beauty, is not only allowed, but approved. In
a portrait or a land&s;cape, likene&s;s to the ori|ginal
is indi&s;pen&s;able; yet in both it is ex|pected
that real genius will &s;et that original
in an advantageous light, heightening its ex|cellences,
and extenuating its defects. What
has been ob&s;erved in one &s;ituation, is often ac|commodated
by the arti&s;t to his own &s;ubject;
but he is at liberty to repre&s;ent it independent
of the things in connexion with which it was
ob&s;erved, to transfer it into a different &s;itua|tion,
and to alter many of its circum&s;tances;
nay, if he take not this liberty, he will be
blamed as too &s;ervile and painful a copier of
Nature, and accu&s;ed of poverty of invention.
Though the arti&s;t's remembrance of real
things be accurate, fancy mu&s;t not borrow the
whole, but &s;natch what &s;uits its purpo&s;e, and
make it its own. A &s;pecies of memory more
accurate than it is allowed to make u&s;e of in
the arts, cannot be reckoned nece&s;&s;ary to ge|nius
for the arts: on the contrary, it might
<PB N="367" REF="374">
hurt this genius, by leading into minute de|tails,
and too circum&s;tantial de&s;criptions or de|lineations.</P>
<P>THE natural appearances which are u&s;eful
in productions in the arts, mu&s;t always be
&s;uch as are in &s;ome re&s;pect &s;triking. To ren|der
memory, therefore, &s;ub&s;ervient to genius
for the arts, it is &s;ufficient that it be fit for re|taining
ideas of &s;uch appearances as have made
a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;en&s;es, as have
forced attention, as have plea&s;ed ta&s;te, as have
excited &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion or emotion, as have
&s;eemed peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing. It is in
a per&s;on who&s;e perceptions are readily ren|dered
&s;trong and durable by the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
that memory will be qualified for depo|&s;iting
materials fit for being employed in the
arts. But the appearances which are of im|portance
in &s;cientific inve&s;tigations are of a
different &s;ort, generally noways &s;triking in
them&s;elves, often apparently incon&s;iderable.
The perceptions of them being thus weaker
than tho&s;e of the other &s;ort, a greater natural
&s;trength of memory is nece&s;&s;ary for retaining
them. The memory mu&s;t likewi&s;e be turned
for deriving &s;trength from &s;uch circum&s;tances
as &s;uit the nature of the&s;e appearances. The
mind mu&s;t be prone to clo&s;e and continued
<PB N="368" REF="375">
attention, that this may infix in the memory
perceptions too weak for laying hold of it by
their own power. It mu&s;t be prone to &s;up|po&s;e
importance in appearances &s;eemingly
trifling and unpromi&s;ing; to look forward to
their tendency and con&s;equences with a high
curio&s;ity and eager pre-expectation, that, if
they turn out in the manner that was looked
for, the gratification of that principle may im|pre&s;s
them indelibly on the mind, or, if they
turn out otherwi&s;e, that principle may be
again excited, which will impre&s;s them no
le&s;s indelibly. It is when circum&s;tances of
this kind have the principal influence on ren|dering
remembrance &s;trong, that memory is
fit for giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;cientifical di&s;co|veries.
In the writings of every per&s;on who
has been remarkable for &s;uch di&s;coveries, we
perceive plain evidences how much power
the&s;e circum&s;tances had over his mind.</P>
<P>THE connexions of things which mu&s;t be
repre&s;ented in the arts, are not the &s;ame with
tho&s;e connexions which mu&s;t be ob&s;erved in
the &s;ciences. The arti&s;t is concerned chiefly
with the re&s;emblances of things, and the&s;e of
the more &s;en&s;ible and &s;triking kinds; and, in
&s;ubordination to the&s;e, with their obvious con|tra&s;ts,
their peculiar and di&s;criminating cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="369" REF="376">
and their more &s;ignal cau&s;es and
effects: the philo&s;opher is concerned with
their cau&s;es, effects, and laws; and, as con|ducive
to the di&s;covery of the&s;e, with their
preci&s;e qualities and adjuncts, their more hid|den
&s;imilitudes and analogies, and their more
&s;ecret differences and contrarieties. Memory
is adapted to genius for the one, or genius for
the other, according as it is turned mo&s;t for
being affected with the former &s;ort of con|nexions,
or with the latter.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How the two Kinds of Genius differ in re&s;pect
of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance which they derive from
Judgment.</HEAD>
<P>BY imagination, with all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
which it can receive from the be&s;t
adapted memory, neither brightne&s;s nor pene|tration
is completed. But in this re&s;pect
there is a con&s;iderable difference between them.
Some degree of brightne&s;s may ari&s;e merely
from the imagination; but no degree of pene|tration
can; the lowe&s;t degree of this cannot
po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t without acutene&s;s of judgment.
Accordingly, though we may with great pro|priety
&s;peak of brightne&s;s of fancy, it would
<PB N="370" REF="377">
be ab&s;olutely improper to u&s;e any expre&s;&s;ions
which implied our a&s;cribing penetration to
this faculty alone.</P>
<P>THAT judgment a&s;&s;i&s;ts genius of every
kind, in &s;ugge&s;ting &s;uch ideas as &s;uit the pur|po&s;e,
was formerly &s;hown. In the &s;ciences,
in producing the materials fit for the inve&s;ti|gation
of truth, this a&s;&s;i&s;tance is indi&s;pen&s;ably
nece&s;&s;ary. The deci&s;ions of judgment con|cerning
objects or ideas already produced, con|&s;idered,
and compared, &s;ugge&s;t to the imagi|nation
other ideas a&s;&s;ociated with the&s;e deci|&s;ions,
and fit for carrying forward the inve&s;ti|gation.
Judgment is employed in giving &s;uch
deci&s;ions, at every &s;tep that is taken; and they
are the only means by which we can be car|ried
forward another &s;tep. In the arts too, the
deci&s;ions of judgment do often &s;ugge&s;t new
ideas; but the ideas ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary may,
in many ca&s;es, be &s;ugge&s;ted by other means.
A rapid imagination often, without giving
judgment time to interpo&s;e, pours in, by its
own force, a great abundance of conceptions,
&s;o proper, that when they are afterwards re|viewed,
the acute&s;t under&s;tanding, and the
nice&s;t ta&s;te, can &s;carce find fault with them.
In the arts, this rapidity of imagination, which
waits not for the interpo&s;ition of judgment,
<PB N="371" REF="378">
often produces a noble boldne&s;s and freedom
of manner; in &s;cience it could produce only
ab&s;urdity and error.</P>
<P>IN &s;cience, an acute and vigorous judgment
is nece&s;&s;ary for making any u&s;e of the concep|tions
which imagination has &s;ugge&s;ted. It is
the preci&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;cience to deduce con|clu&s;ions
from certain ob&s;ervations, experi|ments,
or ideas; but the deduction of the&s;e is
altogether the work of judgment, and will be
performed with greater or le&s;s advantage, in
proportion to the degree of its acutene&s;s.
We &s;ometimes meet with per&s;ons who are re|markable
for making uncommon reflections
on the trite&s;t &s;ubjects, or drawing new con|clu&s;ions
from the mo&s;t familiar facts: this is
acknowledged to imply real ingenuity; but it
&s;hows chiefly acutene&s;s of judgment. The
commonne&s;s of the facts or the &s;ubjects, makes
no great force of imagination requi&s;ite for
bringing them into view; they had actually
been in the view of hundreds: but the&s;e had
not the quickne&s;s of under&s;tanding which has
led to the new conclu&s;ions or reflections.
Many of the facts on which Newton founds
his theory of gravitation, and that of light
and colours, require no great degree of ima|gination
<PB N="372" REF="379">
to bring them into view, and had
actually been ob&s;erved by many. That the
&s;ame conclu&s;ions were not by the&s;e deduced
from them, may be a&s;cribed partly to a defect
of imagination, preventing their being &s;et in
that light in which they would have readily
&s;ugge&s;ted the conclu&s;ions, and partly to the
want of &s;uch depth of judgment as was &s;uffi|cient
for deducing them. Depth of judgment
contributed perhaps more than vigour of ima|gination,
to enable that great philo&s;opher to
perceive the tendency of common facts with
&s;urpri&s;ing quickne&s;s, and to trace their con&s;e|quences
with &s;ingular accuracy. It was in
the contrivance of new experiments, proper
and deci&s;ive, that the vigour of his imagina|tion
&s;howed it&s;elf. Any one propo&s;ition in
Euclid's Elements, follows nece&s;&s;arily from
tho&s;e which precede it; and the work of ima|gination
nece&s;&s;ary for the demon&s;tration of
it, is in a great mea&s;ure performed by the
laying down of the&s;e in a natural order and
&s;eries. Suppo&s;e then a per&s;on perfectly ma|&s;ter
of the fir&s;t forty-&s;ix propo&s;itions; he has
all the principles nece&s;&s;ary for demon&s;trating
that the &s;quare of the hypothenu&s;e of a right|angled
triangle, is equal to the &s;quares of the
<PB N="373" REF="380">
other two &s;ides. To conceive this propo&s;ition
of one's &s;elf, would, however, &s;how a great
degree of genius, a vigour of imagination as
well as of judgment. If the propo&s;ition were
mentioned to him, and he were informed,
that it is deducible from the propo&s;itions al|ready
demon&s;trated, it would &s;till require a
con&s;iderable vigour of both the&s;e faculties, to
conceive the figure nece&s;&s;ary for the demon|&s;tration,
and to make out the &s;everal &s;teps of
it, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. If even the figure were
de&s;cribed, it would indicate &s;ome degree of
genius, immediately to perceive the whole
train of the proof: but in this ca&s;e, a very
great part of the work of imagination is per|formed
by the teacher; it is chiefly acutene&s;s
of judgment that is nece&s;&s;ary for accompli&s;h|ing
what remains. In the more intricate
parts of mathematics, it requires greater vi|gour
of judgment, as well as of imagination,
to &s;ee &s;everal &s;teps before us; and to be ca|pable
of this, &s;hows a higher degree of ge|nius.
Thus, from the very nature and end
of &s;cientifical invention, judgment is con|&s;tantly
and intimately connected with imagi|nation
in all the operations of genius; and a
great acutene&s;s of judgment is nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="374" REF="381">
enabling genius to &s;how it&s;elf.&mdash;But in the
arts, the ideas collected are not applied to the
deduction of conclu&s;ions, which is the proper
work of judgment, and requires rea&s;oning.
They are applied to a quite different purpo&s;e,
to the production of beauty, which imagina|tion
can in &s;ome mea&s;ure accompli&s;h by it&s;elf:
and therefore it is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary,
either that the operations of judgment be &s;o
intimately blended with tho&s;e of fancy, or
that &s;o great a degree of judgment be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THERE is an e&s;&s;ential difference between
tho&s;e relations which are predominant in ge|nius
for the arts, and tho&s;e which are predo|minant
in &s;cientific genius. The former are
intuitively perceivable, the latter are not.
Both of them can affect the imagination and
&s;ugge&s;t ideas, by them connected with the
pre&s;ent object, without our having previou&s;ly
perceived by an exerci&s;e of judgment, that
the&s;e relations belong to the ideas: but it is
natural for us, after ideas have been in this
manner &s;ugge&s;ted, to reflect on the relation
which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them and the objects
that &s;ugge&s;ted them, and to form judgments
concerning it. Now when re&s;emblance, the
<PB N="375" REF="382">
predominant relation in genius for the arts,
has &s;ugge&s;ted an image, a &s;ingle glance of
thought is &s;ufficient for perceiving the reality
of the re&s;emblance; it is &s;elf-evident, it re|quires
no &s;en&s;ible exertion of mind. This is
not the ca&s;e with the relations of cau&s;e and
effect, and co-exi&s;tence, the prevalent rela|tions
in &s;cientific genius. They are not intui|tive
relations; they are perceived to belong
to objects, only in con&s;equence of experience;
they are a&s;certained by a careful examination
and induction. This implies a &s;en&s;ible and
continued exertion of judgment and rea&s;on.
A con&s;iderable degree, therefore, of the exer|ci&s;e
of the&s;e faculties is rendered e&s;&s;ential to
&s;cientific genius, by the nature of tho&s;e rela|tions
about which it is ultimately conver&s;ant.</P>
<P>WERE the&s;e the only relations with which
&s;cientifical deductions are concerned, and re|&s;emblance
the only relation that affect the
imagination in invention in the arts, there
would be a very great difference with re&s;pect
to the degree and kind of judgment nece&s;&s;ary
for a&s;&s;i&s;ting genius in the&s;e two provinces.
But both in &s;cience and in the arts, all the
relations which perceptions can bear to one
another, are, in &s;ubordination to the&s;e predo|minant
<PB N="376" REF="383">
ones, employed for introducing pro|per
conceptions; and con&s;equently there is
&s;cope in both, for the exerci&s;e of the kinds of
judgment adapted to all the cla&s;&s;es of rela|tions.
This makes the difference much le&s;s;
every &s;pecies of judgment may give &s;ome
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, both in &s;cience and in the arts.
Yet &s;till the difference is very con&s;iderable:
for even when the &s;ame &s;pecies of judgment is
employed in the&s;e two, one modification of it
is u&s;eful in the one, and a different modifica|tion
in the other. A judgment, for in&s;tance,
adapted to the perception of mathematical
truths, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary to the
painter; but it is a judgment rather of the
practical re&s;ult of the truths demon&s;trated,
than of the preci&s;e connexion of the&s;e truths
with the principles on which they depend.
The painter and the poet, as well as the phi|lo&s;opher,
mu&s;t pay a regard to experience;
but &s;o exact an agreement to what we have
experienced, is not nece&s;&s;ary for our approv|ing
the works of the arti&s;t, as for our admit|ting
the conclu&s;ions of the philo&s;opher. In
general, the exacter forms of every &s;pecies of
judgment are requi&s;ite in &s;cience, the loo&s;er
forms are &s;ufficient for the arts; the more
<PB N="377" REF="384">
laborious exertions &s;uit the former, the rea|dier
exertions, the latter; the &s;ciences de|mand
uncommon depth and force of rea&s;on,
the arts need rather a certain quickne&s;s of
di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t remarkable difference between
genius for &s;cience, and genius for the arts,
in re&s;pect of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they receive
from judgment, is, that ta&s;te, or the judg|ment
of beauty, is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the
latter, but enters not at all into the former.
This is an article of &s;uch importance, that it
will require a particular con&s;ideration; but
&s;ome ob&s;ervations may be made for farther
illu&s;trating the di&s;tinction between the two
kinds of genius, which are &s;o much connected
with what has been now &s;aid, that it will be
proper to make them, before we proceed to
that.</P>

<P>IT is a di&s;tinction between genius for the
arts, and genius for &s;cience, implied in
what we have &s;aid of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they
receive from judgment, or at lea&s;t ea&s;ily de|ducible
from it, That in the arts, imagination
in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ketches the whole work; in
&s;cience, it cannot. The plan of a poem or a
picture may be conceived by the &s;ole power of
fancy. The a&s;&s;ociating principles may &s;ug|ge&s;t
abundance of materials &s;uited to the de|&s;ign.
The &s;ame principles will naturally
give the&s;e materials different degrees of attrac|tion,
proportioned to their &s;everal degrees of
relation to one another, by means of which
the mo&s;t nearly related will fall regularly into
the &s;ame member, and the whole will ac|quire,
in a good mea&s;ure, a proper order and

no doubt contribute much to render the work
more complete; it will cut off redundancies,
rectify di&s;orders, and even &s;upply defects:

acquire &s;ome degree of form. In &s;cience, on

&s;ketch of an invention: it can only
&s;ugge&s;t the materials from which judgment
may collect that invention; it mu&s;t put them

<P>THIS leads us naturally to an ob&s;ervation
which will give us an opportunity of examin|ing
and a&s;certaining &s;ome &s;entiments and
maxims concerning genius, which are &s;ome|times
expre&s;&s;ed without &s;ufficient preci&s;ion:
the ob&s;ervation is, That genius for the arts
holds more of imagination, than &s;cientific
genius. This ob&s;ervation is &s;o obvious, that
it has been often a&s;&s;erted, That imagination
is nece&s;&s;ary only for productions in the arts,
not at all for di&s;coveries in &s;cience. In con&s;e|quence
of this received opinion, productions
in the arts have been called exclu&s;ively, works
of imagination. The opinion is not ju&s;t; but
it would not have been adopted &s;o generally
as it has been, if it had not, in appearance,
<PB N="380" REF="387">
a &s;trong foundation. It was ju&s;t now ob|&s;erved,
that in the arts imagination goes far|ther
towards perfecting its effects, than it can
in &s;cience; this contributes to make its in|fluence
mo&s;t con&s;picuous in the arts. In one
view too, genius for the arts does require
greater &s;trength of imagination, than pene|tration
requires; it implies a great delicacy
and activity of the a&s;&s;ociating principles, $it|ting
them for being affected by very &s;lender
relations: this al&s;o renders the operation of
fancy more obvious and more &s;triking. Be|&s;ides,
the a&s;&s;ociating principles which are
chiefly implied in brightne&s;s, are more com|monly
referred to the imagination, than tho&s;e
which are predominant in penetration. The
cau&s;e of this &s;eems to be, that the former are
perceived without rea&s;oning, are applied ge|nerally
to the purpo&s;e of plea&s;ing, and, even
when they give ri&s;e to judgments, occa&s;ion
not any proce&s;s of argumentation, but only
intuitive deci&s;ions, which give little exerci&s;e
to the under&s;tanding, and are &s;carce taken
notice of; but the latter cannot be perceived
without the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, they are prin|cipally
u&s;ed for deducing conclu&s;ions, and the
conclu&s;ions to which they lead, imply a con|tinued,
<PB N="381" REF="388">
often a laborious exerci&s;e of judg|ment,
which cannot fail to be reflected on.
Hence it is natural to regard the former as
qualities which affect the imagination, and
the latter as relations about which the judg|ment
is employed; and con&s;equently, if men
do not think with great preci&s;ion, to refer
only genius for the arts to imagination. It
may be added that genius for the arts makes
u&s;e of a greater variety of a&s;&s;ociating princi|ples
than &s;cientific genius, and employs them
in a greater extent, and with le&s;s limitation:
it avails it&s;elf of all the different forms and
modifications of each of them, while very few
forms of any of them can be rendered &s;ub&s;er|vient
to the inve&s;tigation of truth; and it
alone is influenced by the a&s;&s;ociating power
of the pa&s;&s;ions. In all the&s;e re&s;pect, it may
be a&s;&s;erted with rea&s;on, that genius for the
arts holds more of imagination, than &s;cientific
genius, and that its effects may be termed
peculiarly works of imagination. But it is
not true, either that &s;uch genius is completed
by imagination alone, or that it is the only
kind that implies imagination.</P>
<P>SCIENTIFIC genius has been de&s;cribed
with a like inaccuracy; it has been con&s;idered
<PB N="382" REF="389">
as requiring only judgment, and not at all
implying imagination. We have &s;een that it
holds much more of judgment, than genius
for the arts does: this has given occa&s;ion for
a&s;cribing it wholly to that faculty; but it is a
mi&s;take. A very ingenious and profound
philo&s;opher has given his &s;anction to this
mi&s;take; &s;peaking of a work which indicates
a very great degree of &s;cientific genius, not
only uncommon clearne&s;s and depth of judg|ment,
but al&s;o &s;trength and even liveline&s;s of
imagination, he di&s;claims genius, and inti|mates
that the nature of his work required it
not; &startq;I claim no other merit, than that of
having given great attention to the opera|tions
of my own mind, and of having ex|pre&s;&s;ed,
with all the per&s;picuity I was able,
what, I conceive, every man who gives
the &s;ame attention, will feel and perceive.
The productions of imagination require a
genius which &s;oars above the common
rank; but the trea&s;ures of knowlege are
commonly buried deep, and may be reach|ed
by tho&s;e drudges who can dig with
labour and patience, though they have not
wings to fly<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>REID'S</HI> Inquiry into the Human Mind, <HI>Dedication.</HI></NOTE>.&endq; The author's mode&s;ty
<PB N="383" REF="390">
under-rates his own abilities, and in this in|&s;tance
renders his deci&s;ion inaccurate. That
turn of imagination which fits a per&s;on for
productions in the arts, may no doubt be
mo&s;t properly &s;aid to &s;oar, to fly, and to
have wings. To dig with labour and pa|tience,
is a metaphor which may with equal
propriety be applied to the inve&s;tigation of
philo&s;ophical truth; it is &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive
of the inten&s;e and continued exertion of judg|ment,
which is requi&s;ite in ob&s;erving all the
circum&s;tances of the &s;everal experiments, di&s;|cerning
which of them are e&s;&s;ential, compar|ing
them together, and tracing out the re&s;ult
of the whole: but the metaphor mu&s;t not be
over&s;trained, it mu&s;t not be under&s;tood &s;o
&s;trictly as to repre&s;ent the philo&s;opher as a
mere drudge, de&s;titute of fancy; without great
vigour and activity of imagination, the expe|riments
and ob&s;ervations made u&s;e of in that
curious work, or in any philo&s;ophical enquiry
of a like nature, could not be contrived,
&s;ugge&s;ted, and arranged, &s;o as to lay a foun|dation
for legitimate conclu&s;ions. The <HI>In|quiry
into the Human Mind, on the Principles
of Common Sen&s;e,</HI> &s;hows not merely great acute|ne&s;s
of judgment, but al&s;o a very high degree
<PB N="384" REF="391">
of that penetration in which force of imagi|nation
is an indi&s;pen&s;able ingredient. After
the author has unfolded his important di&s;co|veries,
another man may feel and perceive
the &s;everal operations which he de&s;cribes, by
giving even le&s;s attention than he be&s;towed,
and without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any &s;hare of genius;
but genius was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the
making of the di&s;coveries. The work is not,
in the ordinary &s;en&s;e, a production of imagi|nation;
but it di&s;plays imagination and ge|nius,
though of a different kind from what
is di&s;played in a picture or a poem, yet &s;oar|ing
as much above the common rank. In
&s;cience, the operation of judgment is more
obvious and &s;triking than in the arts; it is
it, not imagination, that fini&s;hes the work;
and therefore even that part of the work,
which imagination alone can accompli&s;h, and
which indicates genius, has been a&s;cribed to
judgment.</P>
<P>IN commending a per&s;on, it is common to
be&s;tow all excellence upon him, and to deny
others their real merit in order to exalt him.
The &s;ame cau&s;e from which this appearance
proceeds in ordinary life, has produced the
inaccurate de&s;criptions of genius now men|tioned.
<PB N="385" REF="392">
Becau&s;e imagination can do a great
deal in the arts, genius for them has been
placed in imagination alone. Becau&s;e it can
by it&s;elf do little in the &s;ciences, it has been
excluded from &s;cientific genius; and becau&s;e
judgment has a great &s;hare in the whole pro|ce&s;s
of every di&s;covery which belongs to this
department, all has been a&s;cribed to it. But
as a &s;en&s;ible man allows tho&s;e whom he com|mends,
their proper kind and preci&s;e degree
of merit, &s;o we ought, with a ju&s;t di&s;cernment,
to give each of the&s;e faculties its real &s;hare
in forming every kind of genius.</P>
<P>GENIUS has been defined by &s;ome to con|&s;i&s;t
in the union of a fine imagination and a
fine judgment. According to them, its origin
may be referred with equal propriety to either
of the&s;e faculties, or rather a great perfection
of both is alike nece&s;&s;ary for its exi&s;tence.
The exten&s;ive influence of judgment in pro|ducing
works of genius has given occa&s;ion to
this definition. But genius ought notwith|&s;tanding
to be con&s;idered as a modification of
the imagination. It is no rea&s;on again&s;t our
con&s;idering it in this light, that judgment
attends it in all its exertions. It has been
ob&s;erved already, that intellectual powers,
<PB N="386" REF="393">
e&s;&s;entially di&s;tinct in them&s;elves, are fre|quently
complicated together in their exer|ci&s;e.
Rea&s;on, for in&s;tance, cannot perceive
the evidence of a demon&s;tration, except me|mory
be exerted in retaining the &s;everal
&s;teps: forgetfulne&s;s of the&s;e would as effec|tually
prevent our obtaining a conviction of
the truth of the conclu&s;ion, as an incapacity
of di&s;cerning the evidence of any of the pro|po&s;itions
included in the proof: but it would
be improper, on this account, to confound
rea&s;on with memory. In like manner, though
genius needs the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of judgment, yet
it ought to be con&s;idered as a faculty di&s;tinct
from judgment. Genius con&s;i&s;ts e&s;&s;entially
in the vigour and in a particular economy or
con&s;truction of the imagination: it is in this
that a man mu&s;t excel, in order to be eminent
for genius: where Nature has be&s;towed this
in a con&s;iderable degree, an uncommon accu|racy
of judgment is not requi&s;ite for found|ing
a claim to real genius; a moderate &s;hare
of it will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>COULD the de&s;cription be at all admitted,
it would be applicable only to &s;cientific ge|nius.
With re&s;pect to this &s;pecies, the ex|ten&s;ive
and continued exerci&s;e of judgment
<PB N="387" REF="394">
in pro&s;ecuting di&s;coveries, gives the de&s;crip|tion
a con&s;iderable appearance of propriety.
Yet even here it has not entire propriety.
A per&s;on may po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;trength of judgment
in a very high degree, and the kind of judg|ment
perfectly adapted to &s;cience, and yet
be de&s;titute of &s;cientific genius: he may be
an accurate critic on the inve&s;tigations of
others, and yet him&s;elf no inventer. Many
per&s;ons who could never have made original
di&s;coveries, have explained the di&s;coveries of
others with great di&s;tinctne&s;s, and decided
between contending theories with great acute|ne&s;s
and &s;olidity. On the contrary, a per|&s;on
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that particular form of ima|gination
which fits for &s;cientifical di&s;coveries,
is never wholly de&s;titute of &s;cientific genius;
no &s;uch per&s;on is ever found without a de|gree
of judgment &s;ufficient for enabling him
to make &s;ome di&s;coveries. If his judgment
be not &s;o deep and &s;ound as to prevent his
falling into mi&s;takes, yet his inve&s;tigations
will &s;how ingenuity notwith&s;tanding his
mi&s;takes. The theories of Des Cartes, Leib|nitz,
Malebranche, Berkeley, mu&s;t be acknow|leged
to be ingenious, though in many par|ticulars
they be not ju&s;t: the&s;e philo&s;ophers
<PB N="388" REF="395">
had genius, they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very con&s;iderable
powers of imagination, but not judgment
proportionably piercing. Even in &s;cientific
genius, therefore, imagination is the leading
faculty: where it prevails and is &s;uitably
con&s;tructed, &s;uch genius is never totally
wanting; and without this, no degree of
&s;uch genius ever can exi&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT in genius for the arts, an uncommon
&s;trength of judgment is &s;o far from being
nece&s;&s;ary, that a degree of imagination which
would have produced genius, if it had been
joined to an ordinary judgment, may be
rendered abortive, and unable to di&s;play it&s;elf,
by being united to a very nice judgment.
The great acutene&s;s of this faculty will di&s;|cover
every the &s;malle&s;t blemi&s;h in what
fancy produces, and will, by &s;crupulou&s;ly
canva&s;&s;ing it and requiring greater excellence
than the imagination can attain, extingui&s;h
its ardor, and make it give over attempting to
invent, or el&s;e enervate its inventions, deprive
them of force and &s;pirit, and &s;ub&s;itute an
in&s;ipid correctne&s;s in its place<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Evenit plerumque ut hac diligentia deterior etiam fiat oratio.&mdash;Nam illa quae curam fatentur, et &s;icta atque compo&s;ita videri etiam volunt, nec gratiam con&s;equuntur, &amp;c.

Puntormo is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
degree of genius &s;ufficient for producing pic|tures
which obtained the approbation of
Raphael and Michael Angelo; but the exce&s;|&s;ive
&s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s of his judgment rendered
his genius in a great mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s; he not
only was extremely tedious, but al&s;o could
never plea&s;e him&s;elf, or be &s;ati&s;fied with any
of his own works. It was the &s;ame cau&s;e
that made Virgil enjoin his friends to burn
the Aeneid; it was not fini&s;hed with all the
exactne&s;s that the nicety of his judgment re|quired:

degree of judgment<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Protogenes, whom Apelles blamed for hurting his works by correcting them too much, and Leonardi da Vinci, who left many of his pictures unfini&s;hed, becau&s;e he could not fini&s;h them &s;uitably to his high idea of perfection, are appo|&s;ite examples here; but having had occa&s;ion to quote them el&s;ewhere, the former, <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Ta&s;te,</HI> Part II. &s;ect. 6. the latter, <HI>Ibid.</HI> &s;ect. 5.

then, an uncommon acutene&s;s of judgment
is &s;o far from con&s;tituting genius, that it will
ab&s;olutely de&s;troy genius, unle&s;s the imagi|nation
be as uncommonly comprehen&s;ive.
The former faculty mu&s;t not have greater ac|curacy
than is proportioned to the extent and
vigour of the latter. Judgment mu&s;t pre|&s;erve
imagination from lo&s;ing it&s;elf in its ex|cur&s;ions,
without ob&s;tructing its vi&s;iting freely
all the regions of nature. It mu&s;t prevent
unnatural a&s;&s;ociations, without checking &s;uch
as are bold. It mu&s;t regulate, but not de&s;troy
the impetuo&s;ity and ardor of the &s;oul. It has
been ob&s;erved that, though &s;y&s;tems of pre|cepts
in the arts, direct and improve the
judgment, they rather curb and re&s;train ge|nius.
They render men &s;o &s;tudious to avoid
faults, that they &s;carce aim at beauties. It
is remarked that, when works of imagination
have been brought to the utmo&s;t degree of
correctne&s;s in any age or nation, there has
been afterwards very little di&s;play of original
or exten&s;ive genius. This may have been
owing in part to natural cau&s;es, which &s;eem
never to &s;uffer an age illu&s;trious for arts and
&s;ciences, to be of long continuance: but it
has probably been owing in part likewi&s;e to
<PB N="391" REF="398">
the cau&s;e that is more commonly a&s;&s;igned;
That a ta&s;te for correctne&s;s being once gene|rally
e&s;tabli&s;hed, the nece&s;&s;ity which arti&s;ts
were under of producing this quality, in

<P>THE ob&s;ervations which were formerly
made upon the difference between ge|nius
for the &s;ciences, and genius for the arts,
in re&s;pect of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they receive
from judgment, regarded chiefly the degree
and manner in which judgment is exerci&s;ed
in their operations. But the&s;e two kinds of
genius imply likewi&s;e different kinds of judg|ment.</P>
<P>SCIENTIFIC genius requires only that kind
of judgment which has <HI>truth</HI> for its object;
but it requires great &s;trength of judgment in
that kind. As that kind includes &s;everal
&s;pecies, the predominance of one or another
of the&s;e, will adapt genius to the corre&s;pon|dent
&s;ubject of inve&s;tigation: but any one of
<PB N="392" REF="399">
the&s;e &s;pecies prevailing along with a congru|ous
turn of imagination, will produce &s;ome
form of &s;cientific genius.</P>
<P>GENIUS for the arts does not exclude that
kind of judgment which perceives truth:
it demands not, however, an eminent degree
of it. But another kind of judgment, that
which pronounces concerning <HI>beauty,</HI> and is
ordinarily called <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> is e&s;&s;ential to &s;uch ge|nius.
This is at once a di&s;tinctive character
of genius for the arts, and a common charac|ter
of genius in all the arts.</P>
<P>TASTE, as has been already ob&s;erved in
general, influences genius for the arts, in
all the &s;ame ways in which the di&s;cernment
of truth influences genius of every kind:
and the varieties of ta&s;te, and tho&s;e of judg|ment,
have &s;imilar effects in diver&s;ifying the
forms of genius. Ta&s;te regulates fancy, in|&s;tigates
it, and contributes to give it habitual
regularity; it performs the&s;e offices more or
le&s;s perfectly, and performs them in one
manner or one re&s;pect, or in another, accord|ing
to the degree in which it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and
the &s;pecies of it which predominates.</P>
<P>IN the arti&s;t, ta&s;te exerts it&s;elf continually,
re&s;training, regulating, and directing fancy&punc;
<PB N="393" REF="400">
&s;urveying the conceptions which that faculty
has &s;ugge&s;ted, approving them when they are
&s;uitable to it, perceiving what is faulty, re|jecting
what is redundant, marking what is
incomplete, correcting and perfecting the
whole. Without this exerci&s;e of ta&s;te, the
fir&s;t rude conception of a de&s;ign could never
be improved, nor any fini&s;hed work produced.
Ta&s;te defers not its deci&s;ions till the concep|tion
be expre&s;&s;ed or the de&s;ign executed; it
not only intermixes them with the execution,
but makes them to prevent and direct the ex|ecution.
Where there is true genius, fancy
exhibits its creations &s;o di&s;tinctly in the very
moment of their production, that an acute
ta&s;te can perceive what they will be when
they are executed, and judge beforehand of
their effect. Acutene&s;s of ta&s;te &s;ufficient for
this, is nece&s;&s;ary to the arti&s;t. If he had
only &s;uch a degree of ta&s;te as could pronounce,
upon a lei&s;urely examination, when the work
were actually executed, he mu&s;t have the
whole to begin anew, wherever ta&s;te di&s;ap|proved;
and &s;o many things would require
alteration, that the labour of fini&s;hing any
work would be infinite. An imagination
truly poetical conceives its ideas in a moment,
<PB N="394" REF="401">
&s;o clearly and forcibly, that a vigorous ta&s;te
is able to approve or di&s;approve them before
they are put in words or &s;et off by the har|mony
of numbers. Were the painter inca|pable
of forming a judgment of his de&s;igns
till he had actually put them upon canvas,
he could &s;carce ever fini&s;h a &s;ingle picture.
Every inventer in the fine arts, mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s
that liveline&s;s of imagination, and that quick|ne&s;s
of ta&s;te, which, when united and jointly
exerted, can put it in his power to fore&s;ee the
effect of his conceptions and de&s;igns. If his
ta&s;te be in any re&s;pect imperfect, the kinds
of faults which that imperfection unfits him
for perceiving, cannot be corrected, but will
remain blemi&s;hes in his works.</P>
<P>WHEN ta&s;te has condemned what the arti&s;t
had imagined, he will of cour&s;e endeavour
to &s;et imagination again a working, and to
direct it into another track, that it may &s;ug|ge&s;t
&s;omething which will be approved.
Often it is ta&s;te it&s;elf that in this ca&s;e in&s;ti|gates
imagination. Its deci&s;ions are percep|tions
which excite the fancy, give it an im|pul&s;e,
and &s;ugge&s;t trains of ideas connected
with them. When ta&s;te condemns, the very
nature of the fault which it perceives, often
<PB N="395" REF="402">
&s;ugge&s;ts &s;omething that will be approved.
When it approves, the view which it takes of
its object, may lead to the conception of
&s;omething which it will &s;till more highly ap|prove.
But it is not only by being thus ex|erci&s;ed
about a per&s;on's own productions,
that ta&s;te gives an impul&s;e and direction to
fancy. All the fine arts are, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e,
imitative of Nature; invention in the&s;e arts,
is only ob&s;erving and copying Nature in a
certain manner: natural objects and appear|ances
are ob&s;erved by the arti&s;t, they are con|ceived
with di&s;tinctne&s;s and with force, their
characteri&s;tical circum&s;tances are &s;elected, and
&s;o expre&s;&s;ed as to imprint the whole form on
the minds of others, with the like clearne&s;s
and vivacity with which he him&s;elf appre|hended
it. But, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, it is ta&s;te
alone, that directs and animates his ob&s;erva|tion
of Nature, makes fancy retain a lively
conception of it, and run into the view of
every thing that can contribute to expre&s;s it.
Without an impul&s;e from ta&s;te, imagination
could not begin to act. Natural appearances
and objects lie open to the ob&s;ervation of all;
they are &s;een by ordinary per&s;ons, as well as
by the poet and the painter. The former
<PB N="396" REF="403">
take no notice of them, they have no ta&s;te to
perceive their beauties; but by the latter,
the&s;e beauties are beheld with delight, and
make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion, which rou&s;es ima|gination
to &s;pirited exertions. The former
perceives what is expo&s;ed to his view, but
gro&s;sly, faintly, and confu&s;edly; it can give
no determinate direction to fancy: the ta&s;te
of the latter enables him to perceive every
feature, character, and circum&s;tance of his
object with preci&s;ion and with force; and in
con&s;equence of this, fancy produces a &s;trik|ing
likene&s;s, a delineation of it lively and
preci&s;ely marked. A per&s;on may have fine
ta&s;te, and yet not be a painter or a poet; he
may want that brightne&s;s of fancy, which
the&s;e arts require: but if a per&s;on be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of this, nothing is nece&s;&s;ary to make it blaze
forth, but a high ta&s;te of &s;ome object adapted
to it. Every peculiarity of ta&s;te, by giving
a man peculiar feelings from the objects
which he ob&s;erves, leads him into peculiar
tracks of thinking, corre&s;pondent to it.
Many arti&s;ts in every way, have propo&s;ed to
them&s;elves, &s;ome of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of
their predece&s;&s;ors, as their &s;tandard and their
model: in the choice, they were directed by
<PB N="397" REF="404">
the peculiarity of their own ta&s;te, approving
mo&s;t the di&s;tingui&s;hing excellences of that
ma&s;ter; and that ta&s;te has been generally
powerful enough to give their fancy a direc|tion,
and to &s;tamp their performances with a
character, &s;imilar to his. In all imitations,
it is ta&s;te that gives genius its particular form
and track. Whenever the degree of perfec|tion
to which any art has already arrived,
leads forward to new improvements, it does
&s;o chiefly by means of ta&s;te; it judgments
on the works already produced, point out
new roads of invention to the imagination.
In like manner, with re&s;pect to the great ar|chetype,
Nature, every difference of ta&s;te
will occa&s;ion a corre&s;pondent difference in
the appearances which engage the attention,
and arre&s;t the fancy, and in the point of view
in which they are con&s;idered; and the range
which fancy makes, and the effects which it
produces, will always be &s;uitable and analo|gous
to tho&s;e peculiar perceptions of ta&s;te,
by which it was put in motion.</P>
<P>TASTE is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for forming
genius in the arts, to regularity and correct|ne&s;s.
It is ta&s;te principally that, in this de|partment,
perceives when any of the concep|tions
<PB N="398" REF="405">
produced by fancy, are un&s;uitable to
the end of the work: without its interpo&s;ing
its judgment on that end being &s;ugge&s;ted,
&s;uch conceptions could not be recti&s;ied; with|out
its being in the u&s;e of interpo&s;ing its
judgments, imagination could never acquire
the habit of generally avoiding them. Irre|gularity
in works of art, is mo&s;t commonly
owing to &s;ome defect in ta&s;te; it proceeds
from &s;ome wildne&s;s of imagination, which
a perfectly good ta&s;te would have &s;ubdued.
A luxuriant and undi&s;ciplined imagination
may introduce into a picture &s;ome figure or
attitude, or into a poem &s;ome &s;cene or de|&s;cription
or image, which counteracts the
general effect, or is incon&s;i&s;tent with the pre|vailing
qualities of the piece; it may blend
&s;omething mean with a great &s;ubject, or
&s;omething ludicrous with a &s;olemn one: ta&s;te
&s;ufficiently acute would perceive the incon|gruity
with &s;o high di&s;gu&s;t, as to prevent
imagination from dwelling upon it &s;o long as
fully to conceive it, as at lea&s;t to reject it
whenever it &s;aw it repre&s;ented, and as to take
from imagination by degrees all propen&s;ity
to run into what were &s;o abhorrent from its
views. The kind of irregularity into which
<PB N="399" REF="406">
any arti&s;t runs, will always be that which his
particular ta&s;te is mo&s;t unable to correct.</P>
<P>BY acting upon imagination in the&s;e &s;eve|ral
ways, by checking, by in&s;tigating it, by
giving it regularity, ta&s;te has very great in|fluence
on genius, and the varieties of ta&s;te
contribute much to diver&s;ify the form of ge|nius.
A per&s;on's genius and his ta&s;te are cor|re&s;pondent.
What he approves, and what he
can produce, are of the &s;ame kind, and marked
with the &s;ame character. Every peculiarity
of ta&s;te &s;hows it&s;elf in a man's deci&s;ions con|cerning
the works of others; it &s;hows it&s;elf
al&s;o in his own works, for by it his fancy is,
in a great degree, influenced in producing
them.</P>
<P>BOTH judgment and ta&s;te intermix them|&s;elves
with the operations of fancy; but they
affect the&s;e operations in re&s;pects &s;omewhat
different. While rea&s;on re&s;trains imagina|tion
from conceptions which are contrary to
truth, or &s;ugge&s;ts &s;uch as are conformable to
it, ta&s;te condemns tho&s;e which are defective in
&s;ublimity or grace, and prompts to &s;uch as have
the&s;e qualities. The former rejects what
would render the work fal&s;e or ab&s;urd; the
latter, what would render it in any degree
unplea&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="407">
THOUGH judgment be a nece&s;&s;ary ingre|dient
in good ta&s;te, it can never produce it
without acutene&s;s of the internal &s;en&s;es. If
judgment be &s;trong, but the&s;e &s;en&s;es weak or
wanting, the exertions of genius may be re|gular
and vigorous, &s;o far as judgment could
affect them; but they will be &s;eeble and ir|regular
in tho&s;e qualities which are the proper
objects of ta&s;te. This is ob&s;ervable in almo&s;t
all the productions of rude ages and unpoli&s;hed
nations, often to a very great degree. In every
age, &s;ome per&s;on, even among tho&s;e who are
in &s;everal re&s;pects approveable, betrays, in
&s;ome one particular, a coar&s;ene&s;s of genius in|con&s;i&s;tent
with good ta&s;te. Images which are
low or coar&s;e, may illu&s;trate a &s;ubject with
great exactne&s;s or force; to more rea&s;on they
would therefore appear unexceptionable; but
the leaft delicacy of ta&s;te would be di&s;gu&s;ted
with them, and prevent their admi&s;&s;ion. To
authors who indulge them&s;elves in the u&s;e of
them, we may allow &s;trength of judgment,
but mu&s;t refu&s;e ta&s;te: they may have force,
but want elegance of genius. In the mo&s;t ju|dicious
and eloquent compo&s;itions of our fore|fathers
who lived &s;ome centuries ago, &s;imili|tudes,
allu&s;ions, and incidents are introduced,
&s;o homely or &s;o indelicate, that a nice ta&s;te
<PB N="401" REF="408">
would be di&s;gu&s;ted with the very repetition of
them as examples. Every one has heard of
the low and dirty repre&s;entations introduced
into &s;ome of the Dutch paintings. When
&s;uch appearances are very &s;trong, we enter
readily into the di&s;tinction between judgment
and ta&s;te; we pronounce the author de&s;titute
of the latter, and to this cau&s;e a&s;cribe the
gro&s;sne&s;s of his genius; though the appear|ances
be not &s;o palpable, we pronounce that
incorrectne&s;s or indelicacy of ta&s;te has infected
his genius: in both ca&s;es we can perceive the
difference between that influence which judg|ment
has upon works of genius, and that
which the internal &s;en&s;es have.</P>
<P>THESE &s;en&s;es may, on the contrary, be
&s;trong where judgment is inaccurate. In this
ca&s;e, the arti&s;t is qualified for &s;uch particulars
as contribute to the beauty and elegance of
his work, but not for tho&s;e which render it
ju&s;t and &s;olid. The materials which imagi|nation
pre&s;ents, will be applied &s;o as to plea&s;e
on a &s;uperficial view, rather than to &s;atisfy on
a careful examination. This effect is ob&s;erv|able
in poets who are brilliant without &s;oli|dity,
and in orators who are florid but not
argumentative.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="409">
CONSISTENTLY with goodne&s;s of ta&s;te, ei|ther
judgment or internal &s;en&s;e may predomi|nate
in its compo&s;ition: a work will always
bear marks of the predominance of the one or
the other. Congreve po&s;&s;e&s;ed an elegant ta&s;te,
as well as a &s;parkling imagination; but a
nicer judgment would have repudiated many
of his fla&s;hes of wit, as being unnatural. In
the performances of Pietro Te&s;ta, &s;ublime and
noble ideas, a profu&s;ion of figures &s;trongly
marked, elegance and exactne&s;s of drawing,
&s;how exuberance of fancy and enthu&s;ia&s;m of
genius, united to ta&s;te in many re&s;pects ex|qui&s;ite;
but incoherence of de&s;ign, and a jum|ble
of unconnected figures, render it difficult to
di&s;cover his aim, and turn many of his works
into groupes of mon&s;ters and chimeras: the
exertion of a more accurate and better in|formed
judgment, would have prevented this
wildne&s;s and extravagance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Prints, <HI>chap.</HI> 3.</NOTE>. Correggio
&s;hows exqui&s;ite judgment in the conduct of
his pieces and the union of his painting; un|gracefulne&s;s
in &s;ome of his attitudes, an un|plea&s;ing
di&s;po&s;ition of his groupes, and incor|rectne&s;s
of drawing, betray a ta&s;te not, in
all re&s;pects, fully proportioned to it. Accu|rate
<PB N="403" REF="410">
<HI>judgment</HI> of the anatomy of the human
body, rendered his drawings perfectly correct;
a <HI>ta&s;te</HI> as accurate, would have rendered them
equally elegant<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>FRESNOY'S</HI> Judgment of Painters.</NOTE>. The orations of Demo&s;|thenes
and of Cicero bear plain marks of a
diver&s;ity of ta&s;te, as well as of imagination;
they &s;how that the ta&s;te of the former held
very much of judgment, and the ta&s;te of the
latter, of &s;entiment or feeling. Demo&s;thenes
is the more convincing, Cicero the more plea&s;|ing
orator. The &s;ermons of Barrow and of
Seed, are both eloquent; but in very different
ways: the former &s;hows a copious imagina|tion
united to the &s;ounde&s;t under&s;tanding; the
latter a bright and flowing fancy combined
with quick and elegant feelings.</P>
<P>THERE are different qualities in the works
of genius which fall under the immediate cog|nizace
of judgment, and which require dif|ferent
kinds of judgment. If an arti&s;t be
defective in the kind of judgment adapted to
any one of the&s;e qualities, he cannot direct his
imagination in producing it, though in pro|ducing
other qualities, to which his under|&s;tanding
is adapted, he may be very judicious.
Both the di&s;po&s;ition, for in&s;tance, of the whole
<PB N="404" REF="411">
performance, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of particular
parts, are objects of judgment; a work may
be perfect in one of the&s;e re&s;pects, and infe|riour
or faulty in the other. Among the an|cient
painters, Amphion excelled in the for|mer,
A&s;clepiodorus in the latter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Nec deb$bat Amphioni de di&s;po&s;itione, nec A&s;clepio|doro de men&s;uris. PLIN. <HI>Nat. Hi&s;t.</HI> lib. xxxv. cap. 10. Eadem a$tate A&s;clepiodorus fuit, quem in &s;ymmetria mirabatur Apelles. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN like manner, if a per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any
one of the internal &s;en&s;es in great perfection,
his imagination will never want a prompter
and a guide in producing the qualities which
are the proper objects of that &s;en&s;e; while it
may fail much in producing the qualities
adapted to &s;uch other &s;en&s;es as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in
an inferiour degree. Zeuxis was e&s;teemed the
fir&s;t of the ancient painters in re&s;pect of co|louring;
Euphranor was admired for the &s;ub|limity
of his works; both were cen&s;ured for
neglecting proportion in &s;ome particulars<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Depr$henditur tamen Zeuxis grandior in capitibus ar|ticuli&s;que. PLIN. <HI>Ibid.</HI> cap. 9. Euphranor&mdash;primus videtur et expre&s;&s;i&s;&s;e dignitates, in&s;ignia her$um, et u&s;urpa&s;&s;e &s;ymme|triam: &s;ed fuit in univer&s;itate corporum exilior, capitibus, articuli&s;que grandior. <HI>Ibid.</HI> cap. 11.</NOTE>:
the former &s;howed an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e of one
&s;pecies of beauty, that of colours; the latter,
a ta&s;te for the grand and noble; ta&s;te for the
<PB N="405" REF="412">
beauty of proportion was not perfect in either.
Ari&s;tides was defective in the particular in
which Zeuxis excelled, in ta&s;te for beauty and
&s;oftne&s;s of colouring, as well as in the power
of producing it: but in expre&s;&s;ing the pa&s;&s;ions
and affections, he excelled all his predece&s;|&s;ors<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Is omnium primus animum pinxit, $t $enfus omnes ex|pre&s;&s;it, quos vocant Gr$eci <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; item perturbationes: durior paullo in coloribus. PLIN. <HI>Ibid.</HI> cap. 10.</NOTE>;
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a quickne&s;s and acute|ne&s;s
of feeling, which fitted him for con|ceiving
&s;trongly, and con&s;equently for expre&s;|&s;ing
forcibly, the traces with which the in|ward
emotions mark the features and the atti|tude.
It was the character of Pyreicus, that he
painted only mean &s;ubjects, but painted them
with great beauty<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Humilia quidem &s;ecutus, humilitatis tamen &s;ummam adeptus e&s;t gloriam. PLIN. <HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE>: this &s;howed ta&s;te, in
one re&s;pect grovelling, and in another re&s;pect
elegant. A &s;imilar conjunction is very re|markable
in Swift: his writings put it beyond
doubt that he was ingenious, in many re&s;pects
judicious, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a ta&s;te for correct|ne&s;s
and elegance of compo&s;ition; but they
abound with low &s;ubjects, gro&s;s ideas, and
dirty images, incon&s;i&s;tent with delicacy of
&s;entiment.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="413">
SENSIBILITY of ta&s;te, is nece&s;&s;ary to its
perfection; it makes a per&s;on feel &s;trongly
every beauty or blemi&s;h which he perceives.
A lively imagination can never exi&s;t where
&s;en&s;ibility of ta&s;te is wanting; or if it could,
all that it produced would be frigid and &s;pi|ritle&s;s;
no object could make an impre&s;&s;ion
&s;ufficient to give it a bri&s;k and active motion.
A great degree of &s;en&s;ibility, if the other per|fections
of ta&s;te were wanting, joined with a
fancy proportionably lively, would carry an
arti&s;t into wildne&s;s and extravagance. But if
the &s;en&s;ibility be not exce&s;&s;ive, and if it be ac|companied
by the other perfections of ta&s;te, it
will only rai&s;e vivacity of imagination to a
proper pitch. It is enraptured by every &s;trik|ing
form, it fills the &s;oul with high enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
it &s;ets the fancy on fire, it pu&s;hes it for|ward
with impetuo&s;ity, renders all its concep|tions
glowing, and be&s;tows a freedom and be|coming
negligence on its productions. When
a ta&s;te of this con&s;truction exerci&s;es it&s;elf about
what fancy is producing, it approves with &s;o
high a reli&s;h, or di&s;approves with &s;o quick a
di&s;gu&s;t, as communicates new vivacity and
force to the efforts of imagination. Great &s;en|&s;ibility
of ta&s;te contributed not a little to Gior|gione's
<PB N="407" REF="414">
freedom of drawing, &s;trength of co|louring,
and of relief; and to the boldne&s;s,
rapidity, and even extravagance, which are
remarked in Tintoret's manner.</P>
<P>REFINEMENT and elegance of ta&s;te has an
effect on fancy, in &s;ome re&s;pects oppo&s;ite to
tho&s;e of &s;en&s;ibility. Where it prevails, it
hinders many forms and appearances &s;triking
to others, from yielding it &s;uch gratification
as may make an impre&s;&s;ion on the fancy.
There is no ri&s;k of its running into extrava|gance;
the danger is, le&s;t it deviate into
quaintne&s;s, affectation, and &s;ubtilty. Vicious
refinement is plea&s;ed with the&s;e, and &s;ends
imagination in &s;earch of them; they are
adopted, and u&s;urp the place of natural beau|ties.
But true refinement of ta&s;te leads ima|gination
to reject whatever is coar&s;e, or even
of inferiour beauty, and, penetrating into &s;uch
beauties as are mo&s;t latent, feeling &s;uch as are
mo&s;t delicate, and comprehending &s;uch as are
mo&s;t complex, it enables them to affect and
give an impul&s;e to fancy, and directs it to pro|duce
not only what is beautiful, but what is
elegant, not only what plea&s;es, but al&s;o what
fills the ta&s;te, to produce according to the par|ticular
&s;tructure of the imagination, the grace|ful,
<PB N="408" REF="415">
the profound, or the extraordinary. The
arti&s;ts of &s;imple ages, can &s;carce attain &s;o great
a refinement of ta&s;te, as to avoid, in every in|&s;tance,
ideas which will appear gro&s;s and be|come
unplea&s;ing in politer times. Even Ho|mer
admits images in &s;ome degree coar&s;e and
indelicate; Virgil, bred in the elegance of the
Augu&s;tan age, was directed by an improved
ta&s;te, when he imitated him mo&s;t clo&s;ely, to
reject &s;ome of the&s;e images altogether, and to
avoid the offen&s;ive part of others. It is the
want of perfect elegance of ta&s;te formed by ac|quaintance
with the be&s;t models, that has mixt
&s;tifne&s;s and ungracefulne&s;s with the great
excellences of Albert Durer, Hans Holbein,
Rembrandt, and even Rubens.</P>
<P>CORRECTNESS of ta&s;te &s;ecures a per&s;on
from approving any but real beauties, or di&s;|approving
any but real faults, and enables
him to perceive the preci&s;e kind and degree
of both. The ju&s;tne&s;s of its deci&s;ions often
gives occa&s;ion to a new exertion of imagi|nation,
where otherwi&s;e it would not have
been attempted. But it influences imagination
principally, not by in&s;tigating, but by re&s;train|ing
and directing it, and forming it to regu|larity.
A great degree of correctne&s;s will
<PB N="409" REF="416">
perfectly chill a weak imagination, and pre|vent
its producing any thing. It is related
of Andrea Verrochio, that he was &s;o &s;en&s;ible
of the inferiority of his own figures to one
which Leonardo da Vinci, then his &s;cholar,
had by his order painted in one of his
pieces, that he never afterwards attempted
painting; had his ta&s;te determined le&s;s ju&s;tly,
he might have continued to produce works
de&s;erving approbation. If it does not totally
chill a moderate fancy, it will at lea&s;t check it
&s;o much as to produce a mediocrity, where
nothing is faulty, but nothing plea&s;es highly.
It is the character of Andrea del Sarts, that he
is careful, diligent, and correct, but defective
in life and &s;pirit. Even the fine genius of
Protogenes &s;uffered, in the opinion of Apelles,
by the too great correctne&s;s of his ta&s;te leading
him to di&s;pirit his pictures by exce&s;&s;ive care.
Correctne&s;s of ta&s;te has di&s;ciplined Pope's ge|nius
&s;o much, that &s;ome have refu&s;ed him all
preten&s;ions to imagination. It is an imagi|nation
uncommonly bright and vigorous, that
can bear all the re&s;traints which a correct ta&s;te
lays it under. It requires the&s;e re&s;traints;
without them, great blemi&s;hes will be inter|mixed
with great beauties in its works: by
<PB N="410" REF="417">
&s;ubmitting to them, the immortal works of
Milton would have been cleared of the con|ceits
and quibbles which di&s;grace them.</P>
<P>PERFECTION of ta&s;te requires the union,
the due proportion, and the regular adju&s;tment
of all its principles. If any principle of ta&s;te
be wanting, or weak in compari&s;on with the
re&s;t, imagination mi&s;&s;es both the regulation
and the impul&s;e which that principle would
have given it; and its productions bear marks
of its having mi&s;&s;ed them. Every poet, every
painter, every arti&s;t, who leaves in his works
what is di&s;gu&s;ting to one of the principles of
ta&s;te, while he &s;atisfies the other principle,
&s;hows a defect in their comparative vigour.
They were never perhaps united in any man
in a proportion perfectly exact; while none is
wanting or remarkably defective, &s;ome degree
of imperfection is always perceivable in &s;ome
one of them, and &s;ome other is &s;o exqui&s;itely
perfect as to give ta&s;te its predominating cha|racter;
but &s;till the vigour in which they all
exi&s;t, is &s;ufficient for giving ta&s;te enlargement
and regularity. When a ta&s;te &s;o perfect is
united to a vigorous imagination, it produces
genius in &s;ome &s;en&s;e univer&s;al, fit for render|ing
its work really, though not equally, ex|cellent
<PB N="411" REF="418">
in all re&s;pects, marked with features
corre&s;pondent to the characteri&s;tical form of
that ta&s;te. It is a piercing imagination thus
directed by a fine ta&s;te, that has entitled a few
arti&s;ts in every way to the fir&s;t rank. Nei|ther
Homer nor Virgil is ab&s;olutely faultle&s;s;
each has his principal and di&s;tinctive excel|lence;
but both have &s;o much excellence in
every kind, as could not have been attained
without perfection of ta&s;te, as well as of ima|gination.
Titian's ta&s;te in drawing was not
exactly correct; &s;trength and beauty of co|louring
was his leading excellence, and &s;howed
the prevailing turn of his ta&s;te, which was,
at the &s;ame time, in all other re&s;pects &s;o good
as to guide his fancy and his pencil into great
delicacy of drawing, agreeable re&s;emblance of
Nature, &s;pirited and characteri&s;tical touches,
diver&s;ified and graceful attitudes, plea&s;ing ne|gligence
of drapery, and in a word no ordi|nary
degree of every excellence. It was the
prai&s;e of Raphael, that, though he fell &s;hort
of &s;ome in colouring, yet while he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
in grace, he likewi&s;e was ma&s;ter of more of
the excellent parts of painting than any other
arti&s;t. It was a like univer&s;ality of ta&s;te, along
with great power of imagination, that enabled
<PB N="412" REF="419">
Hannibal Carracci to unite in him&s;elf the per|fections
of all former arti&s;ts, and to imitate
them at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IN a word, every work of genius mu&s;t, in
its characteri&s;tical excellences and defects, bear
plain marks of the degree in which its au|thor
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any of the perfections of ta&s;te.
Every man's peculiar ta&s;te, exerting it&s;elf
along with his imagination, puts him on
&s;earching for &s;uch conceptions as it mo&s;t re|li&s;hes,
on moulding them into that form which
&s;uits it be&s;t, on adopting &s;uch as it approves, on
avoiding and rejecting whatever it di&s;approves.</P>
<P>I SHALL take occa&s;ion here to remark a
difference between genius for &s;cience, and ge|nius
for the arts, re&s;ulting from the diver&s;ity
of all the powers employed in the&s;e two de|partments,
and of the manner in which they
are employed, a difference that, for this rea|&s;on,
falls not properly under any of the par|ticular
heads hitherto con&s;idered. The exer|tions
of &s;cientific genius have in their nature
a certain &s;edatene&s;s, gravity, and au&s;terity:
genius for the arts operates with a kind of
&s;prightline&s;s, gaiety, vivacity, or impetuo&s;ity.
This difference may be accounted for from the
ob&s;ervations which we have already made.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="420">
IT ari&s;es in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the different
degrees and manners in which <HI>judgment</HI> is
exerci&s;ed in the&s;e two kinds of genius. All
the exertions of judgment about truth, are in
their nature cool and compo&s;ed; and in the
operation of &s;cientific genius, the&s;e exertions
are almo&s;t uninterrupted. An idea is no &s;ooner
&s;ugge&s;ted than it is examined, &s;crutinized,
and rea&s;oned upon, and deliberately pur&s;ued
through all its con&s;equences: this exerci&s;e
calms, and as it were depre&s;&s;es the &s;oul, and
gives a ca&s;t of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s to the operation of
genius in inve&s;tigating truth. Invention in
the arts, requires not &s;o continual an exerci&s;e
of judgment, and therefore wants that ca&s;t.
The exertion of judgment has a greater de|gree
of &s;edatene&s;s, and more depre&s;&s;es the &s;oul,
when rea&s;oning is nece&s;&s;ary, than when the
deci&s;ion is intuitive; and the more intricate
and laborious the rea&s;oning is, the greater is
the &s;edatene&s;s and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s with which it is
pur&s;ued. In &s;cientific invention, judgment is
exerci&s;ed chiefly in rea&s;oning. But in the
arts, an idea &s;ugge&s;ted, generally appears fit or
unfit at fir&s;t &s;ight, and is adopted or rejected
in an in&s;tant; even when it needs to be
canva&s;&s;ed, this is done without a laborious
<PB N="414" REF="421">
&s;crutiny, and therefore without introducing
&s;olemnity of di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE perception of <HI>truth</HI> is an indifferent
feeling; the &s;entiments of <HI>ta&s;te</HI> are not indif|ferent:
the conclu&s;ions which the philo&s;opher
forms in the cour&s;e of his inve&s;tigation, are
apprehended without any &s;en&s;ation of plea|&s;ure;
the work of the arti&s;t, in the &s;everal
&s;teps of his progre&s;s, is continually gratifying
his ta&s;te, giving him &s;en&s;ations of delight, and
by means of the&s;e elevating his mind and en|livening
his temper. The inventer in &s;cience
has often indeed high plea&s;ure from the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of &s;ucce&s;s; but the arti&s;t enjoys this
in common with him, and has all the plea|&s;ures
of ta&s;te &s;uperadded to it. If the philo|&s;opher's
plea&s;ure in the gratification of his cu|rio&s;ity
is to be con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from the
agreeable con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ucce&s;s, yet it is a
&s;atisfaction of a more &s;edate nature than mo&s;t
of the gratifications of ta&s;te, and therefore le&s;s
fit for enlivening the &s;oul.</P>
<P>THE exertions of the <HI>imagination</HI> have in
them&s;elves &s;omething bri&s;k and &s;prightly;
but tho&s;e exertions of it, which enter into &s;ci|entific
genius, have le&s;s of this character than
the $lights of fancy roaming through all the
<PB N="415" REF="422">
remote&s;t relations, and often likewi&s;e animated
by the influence of the pa&s;&s;ions, which take
place in the arts: and con&s;equently, &s;cientific
genius would be more &s;edate and compo&s;ed
than the other kind, though the continued
and laborious interpo&s;ition of judgment did
not check the natural gaiety and impetuo&s;ity
of imagination. The mind is perhaps occu|pied
with equal inten&s;ene&s;s in both kinds of
invention; and hence enthu&s;ia&s;m is common
to both kinds of genius: but the mind is oc|cupied
in different ways; different faculties
of it are principally engaged. In &s;cience,
judgment is employed as much as imagina|tion;
and in &s;cientific genius, that complexion
is predominant which marks the exertions of
the former: its operations are &s;edate and com|po&s;ed,
and it is generally attended with &s;oli|dity
of temper, and with a character who&s;e
very peculiarities have a certain gravity and
&s;tayedne&s;s. In the arts, judgment is le&s;s fre|quently
interpo&s;ed, and it is interpo&s;ed with
le&s;s labour, imagination is left at liberty to
pur&s;ue its cour&s;e without a continual check,
and therefore pur&s;ues it with a &s;ort of ala|crity
and chearfulne&s;s, heightened by the ever
returning approbations of ta&s;te: genius for
<PB N="416" REF="423">
the arts, partakes generally in this tempera|ment
of imagination; it is &s;prightly in all its
motions, and is often accompanied with a
turn of character gay, un&s;taid, or de&s;ultory.
Sometimes indeed a melancholy ca&s;t is found
along with great genius in the arts; when it
is, it proceeds either from a &s;imilar ca&s;t of
imagination, or from quick &s;en&s;ibility, the
common attendant of a lively fancy and a de|licate
ta&s;te, too &s;trongly affected by the gloo|mier
views of human life.</P>

<P>SCIENTIFIC genius compleats its
operations by <HI>invention;</HI> at lea&s;t, very
ordinary talents are &s;ufficient for <HI>expre&s;&s;ing</HI> its
di&s;coveries, and it is not con&s;idered as &s;uffer|ing
a very great diminution of its proper
merit, from the want of ability for elegant
expre&s;&s;ion: but genius for the arts implies,
in every ca&s;e, not only the power of inven|tion,
but al&s;o the power of <HI>execution.</HI> In
different arts, the manners of expre&s;&s;ion, or
<PB N="417" REF="424">
the in&s;truments of execution are &s;o different,
that, without entering into the peculiarities of
the&s;e, it is not po&s;&s;ible to explain fully this
part of genius. But a capacity of employing
&s;ome in&s;trument, &s;o as to expre&s;s the concep|tions
of the imagination, is common to ge|nius
for all the arts. Some ob&s;ervations will,
therefore, be proper, concerning that capa|city,
&s;o far as it is thus common. This is all
that we &s;hall attempt at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>A CAPACITY for execution is &s;ometimes
found in a per&s;on who has no power of inven|tion;
but when it is, it implies not any de|gree
of genius. There are mechanics who
can execute a machine from a model or pat|tern,
with great dexterity and neatne&s;s, who
could not have contrived that machine, who
could not &s;o much as have conceived it from
a de&s;cription, and who could not make any
improvement on the &s;tructure of the &s;imple&s;t
uten&s;il. There are per&s;ons who can paint
very exactly after a copy, but could not de|&s;ign
an hi&s;torical picture, or a land&s;cape, nor
even draw a portrait from the life. Per&s;ons
incapable of mu&s;ical invention, may yet be
admirable performers. In poetry, a power
of execution &s;eparated from every degree of
<PB N="418" REF="425">
the corre&s;pondent invention, is perhaps more
rare than in any of the other arts; yet there
are tolerable ver&s;ifiers, who could not derive
from their own fund, any part of the plan of
a poem. It would be an impropriety to attri|bute
genius to &s;uch per&s;ons; it is &s;carce ever
attributed to them, by tho&s;e who think with
the lea&s;t preci&s;ion; the capacity which they
&s;how, is &s;ometimes termed ingenuity, but it
is always di&s;tingui&s;hed from that &s;ort of inge|nuity
which belongs to invention:
<Q>Di&s;tat ab ingenio longe manus,&mdash;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>FRESNOY</HI> de arte graph, <HI>ver.</HI> 494.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>&s;ays a writer on painting; the ob&s;ervation is
applicable to all the arts.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, there may be &s;ome
degree of invention in a particular art, with|out
a capacity of corre&s;pondent execution. A
per&s;on may compo&s;e in mu&s;ic, who cannot
perform. Many have invented the &s;ubject of
a picture, and in idea de&s;igned the whole of
it, &s;o that, from their de&s;cription of their
conception, a ma&s;ter might execute it, though
they them&s;elves never u&s;ed the pencil. Others
might proceed a &s;tep farther; they could
&s;ketch out the piece, without being able to
<PB N="419" REF="426">
colour it. It is remarked of Pietro Te&s;ta,
that in drawings, his execution is both ma|&s;terly
and correct, but notwith&s;tanding this,
and notwith&s;tanding his having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in|vention
&s;ublime and exuberant, he attempted
often, without &s;ucce&s;s, to acquire the art of
colouring. In like manner, a per&s;on may con|ceive
the whole plan of a poem, and even
expre&s;s it agreeably in pro&s;e, who cannot
cloath it with numbers. The Telemachus
of Fenelon is a direct example of this. Such
per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;s real genius, and perhaps a high
degree of it, &s;o far as it extends: but they
&s;how not a genius complete in the art to which
it points. In order to compleat genius in any
of the arts, a man mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of
employing a proper vehicle, congruous to the
nature of that art, for conveying the concep|tions
of his imagination to the &s;en&s;es and the
&s;ouls of other men. It is this that puts it in
the power of genius to &s;how it&s;elf: without
this, its fine&s;t conceptions would peri&s;h, like
an infant in the womb; without this, the
brighte&s;t imagination would be like a vigo|rous
mind confined in a lame or paralytic
body. Want of &s;kill in execution was, per|haps,
the only thing that hindered &s;ome of
<PB N="420" REF="427">
the earlie&s;t painters, and &s;ome of the fir&s;t re|&s;torers
of the art, who are now neglected and
almo&s;t forgotten, from obtaining a very high
rank.</P>
<P>IN every art, expre&s;&s;ion contains &s;omething
mechanical. In painting, the management of
the pencil; in mu&s;ic, the u&s;e of the in&s;tru|ment;
in poetry, the artifice of numbers, or
dexterity in ver&s;ifying, are in a great mea&s;ure
mechanical. So far, expre&s;&s;ion may be learn|ed;
and without exerci&s;e, no per&s;on can be|come
perfect in it. The greate&s;t geniu&s;es
have been &s;en&s;ible of this: Apelles made it
a rule to paint &s;omething every day<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Apelli fuit alioquin perpetua con&s;uetudo, nunquam tam occupatam diem agendi, ut non, lineam ducendo, exer|ceret artem; quod ab eo in proverbium venit. PLIN. <HI>Nat. Hi&s;t.</HI> lib. xxxv. cap. 10.</NOTE>. Ti|tian
for many years copied whatever he un|dertook,
with great labour and care, that he
might thus acquire an ea&s;y manner<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>FRESNOY'S</HI> Judgment of Painters.</NOTE>. But
there are many whom no exerci&s;e or in&s;truc|tion
will be &s;ufficient for rendering ma&s;ters of
it. A certain turn of mind is nece&s;&s;ary for
acquiring it: and that turn of mind which
&s;its a per&s;on for learning ea&s;ily and well the
mechanical part of expre&s;&s;ion in any particu|lar
<PB N="421" REF="428">
art, is an ingredient in genius for that
art.</P>
<P>A GOOD deal of previous knowlege is like|wi&s;e
nece&s;&s;ary for a per&s;on's executing in any
of the arts. Knowlege, for in&s;tance, of the
words of a language, of its &s;tructure, of the
mea&s;ures which &s;uit it, is prerequi&s;ite to the
poet; knowlege of anatomy, of per&s;pective,
of the nature of colours, to the painter. But
a turn of mind congruous to the particular
kind of knowlege, will a&s;&s;i&s;t him greatly in
acquiring it; and an imagination &s;uited to
any of the fine arts, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for
enabling him to perceive, nay for prompting
him to con&s;ider, how his knowlege may be
applied to that art. In the moment of execu|tion
al&s;o, imagination is employed in &s;ugge&s;t|ing
this knowlege, and rendering it &s;ub&s;ervient
to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. Such a turn of mind,
and &s;uch a &s;tructure of imagination, as fits
for this, is nece&s;&s;ary for compleating a genius
for the arts.</P>
<P>THE power of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;o far as it dif|fers
both from mechanical dexterity, and from
knowlege acquired by &s;tudy, con&s;i&s;ts perhaps
entirely in a capacity of &s;etting objects in &s;uch
a light that they may affect others with the
<PB N="422" REF="429">
&s;ame ideas, a&s;&s;ociations, and feelings, with
which the arti&s;t is affected. This capacity
ari&s;es chiefly from &s;uch force of imagination
as at once renders the conception of things
preci&s;e and definite, and leads a per&s;on to
fore&s;ee readily what effect every touch in the
expre&s;&s;ion will produce, or to conceive quickly
the proper means of producing any de&s;ired
effect. This is obviou&s;ly re&s;olveable into a&s;&s;o|ciation,
and therefore will, in every art, be
found to &s;pring from the &s;ame principles of the
mind, which form the &s;ource of invention in
that art. It is quickne&s;s and readine&s;s in thus
fore&s;eeing and conceiving, that in a great mea|&s;ure
renders the execution &s;pirited; it alone
can prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of frequently alter|ing
and retouching, which never fails to pro|duce
deadne&s;s and languor.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens that particular cir|cum&s;tances
render it impo&s;&s;ible to employ the
mo&s;t obvious and direct means of producing a
certain effect. It &s;hows great power of ex|pre&s;&s;ion
to contrive readily, in &s;uch a ca&s;e,
&s;ome other means le&s;s obvious. The mo&s;t
natural means of marking the principal figure
in a picture, is by the &s;trength of the lights;
a peculiarity in the di&s;po&s;ition may &s;ometimes
<PB N="423" REF="430">
prevent the painter from u&s;ing this means,
and he may notwith&s;tanding render his prin|cipal
figure con&s;picuous, by a peculiarity in
the colouring. The contrivance of Timan|thes,
an ancient painter, is well known, and
has been often applauded: in the &s;acrifice of
Iphigenia, being unable to give to the father
a greater degree of &s;orrow than he had given
to the other &s;pectators, he produced the &s;ame
effect by concealing his face<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ejus enim e&s;t Iphigenia, oratorum laudibus celebrata: qua &s;tante ad aras peritura, cum moe&s;tos pinxi&s;&s;et omnes, prae|cipue patrem; cum tri&s;titiae omnem imaginem con&s;ump&s;i&s;&s;et, patris ip&s;ius vultum velavit, quem digne non poterat often|dere.

<P>IT always &s;hows real genius to execute
one's beautiful inventions by the in&s;truments
and in the manners which are well known,
and have been long in u&s;e. But a much
greater degree of genius was di&s;played by
tho&s;e arti&s;ts who fir&s;t brought the&s;e in&s;tru|ments
into u&s;e, or who con&s;iderably improved
the manner of u&s;ing them. If it be true that
<PB N="424" REF="431">
Apollodorus was the fir&s;t who had the art of
expre&s;&s;ing the lights and &s;hades in painting,
he by this &s;howed a higher genius in expre&s;|&s;ion,
than they who have, even with the
greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, practi&s;ed that art, &s;ince he
di&s;covered it. Correggio &s;howed great origi|nality
by introducing a new and peculiar
manner of di&s;tributing lights, &s;o as to give
uncommon force and roundne&s;s to his pic|tures<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>FRESNOY'S</HI> Judgment of Painters.</NOTE>.
The poet who fir&s;t introduced a
mea&s;ure adapted to a particular &s;ort of &s;ub|jects,
and u&s;ed it properly, has a claim to
genius in expre&s;&s;ion, &s;uperior to their's who
have afterwards written poems in that &s;uit|able
mea&s;ure. Spen&s;er's &s;tanza may be re|garded
as one indication of his genius, though
the imitation of it by others has been &s;ome|times
cenfured as injudicious.</P>
<P>IT generally happens, that the expre&s;&s;ion
of an arti&s;t, bears the &s;ame character with his
invention. It is natural that it &s;hould; the
imagination influences both, by many of the
&s;ame principles. Pindar's fancy was wild,
his ver&s;ification al&s;o is irregular. Pope's ima|gination
was correct, &s;o is his ver&s;e. But
&s;ometimes, the invention and the expre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="425" REF="432">
are of different complexions. In invention
Pietro Te&s;ta was enthu&s;ia&s;tic and incoherent,
but his drawing was elegantly correct. Such
di&s;&s;onance between the two operations of ge|nius
in the arts, may ari&s;e from a di&s;&s;imila|rity
in the turn of his imagination and his
ta&s;te. It may ari&s;e likewi&s;e from a defect, or
from an excellence, in the mechanical part of
expre&s;&s;ion. A defect in this will render the
organs unable to do ju&s;tice to the conceptions.
The be&s;t poet may expre&s;s his ideas to great
di&s;advantage by writing in a dead or foreign
language. Freedom and ea&s;ine&s;s of invention
is a&s;cribed to Simon Memmi, but the art of
painting was in his time &s;o much in its infan|cy,
that his execution could not throw off the
contrary character of &s;tiffne&s;s. The earlie&s;t
works even of Raphael and Titian, &s;how &s;ome
drine&s;s in the execution, incongruous to their
other excellences, owing either to the want
of practice, or to the imperfect manner of
their ma&s;ters<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>and</HI> Ob&s;ervation on his Art of Painting.</NOTE>. On the other hand, a
great dexterity in the mechanical part, may
rai&s;e the execution to a degree or kind of ex|cellence,
far beyond the arti&s;t's power of in|vention.
Many painters have very happily
<PB N="426" REF="433">
copied a manner of execution very unlike to
their own turn of genius.</P>

<P>THE &s;um of what has been &s;aid, is
this: &s;cientific genius ari&s;es from &s;uch
vigour of imagination as di&s;po&s;es a per&s;on to
be affected chiefly by the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t
important relations of things, particularly by
cau&s;ation and co-exi&s;tence, operating power|fully,
giving a propen&s;ity to &s;et every object
in that attitude in which it lays a foundation
for the&s;e relations; and making all the other
principles of a&s;&s;ociation to act in &s;ubordination
to the&s;e; and it requires the a&s;&s;i&s;tance both of
an exact and &s;olid judgment, and of an accu|rate
and di&s;tinct memory. Genius for the
arts &s;prings from &s;uch liveline&s;s of imagina|tion
as di&s;po&s;es a per&s;on to attend chiefly to
tho&s;e qualities of things, which lay a founda|tion
for relations between them and many
others, to be affected by the &s;lighter degrees
of relation, or by the more trivial relations,
e&s;pecially to be actuated by re&s;emblance, as
his predominant and leading principle of a&s;&s;o|ciation;
<PB N="427" REF="434">
with a memory &s;imilarly turned;
and it requires for compleating it, a quickne&s;s
of di&s;cernment, and great acutene&s;s and live|line&s;s
of ta&s;te; together with the power of
imparting, by means of &s;ome &s;en&s;ible in&s;tru|ment,
his own &s;entiments and conceptions to
other men.</P>
<P>ALL the principles combined in genius,
are very differently modified in the&s;e two
&s;pecies of it; in &s;ome principal re&s;pects, the
modifications are even oppo&s;ite. This abun|dantly
expo&s;es a conceit, which has been very
crudely thrown out by &s;ome<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See RUFFHEAD'S <HI>Life of Pope.</HI></NOTE>, in oppo&s;ition
to the plaine&s;t experience, That a man who
has genius in one way, will have equal ge|nius
in any other way to which he is plea&s;ed
to turn him&s;elf with equal application; nay,
that there is no original difference between
tho&s;e who di&s;play the greate&s;t genius, and
tho&s;e who &s;how none: but that all the differ|ence
between genius and no genius, between
genius of one kind and of another, ari&s;es
from education, &s;tudy, adventitious cau&s;es,
and acquired habits. The a&s;&s;ertion is irrecon|cileable
to the commone&s;t appearances in hu|man
life; and in the whole cour&s;e of this
<PB N="428" REF="435">
enquiry, we have found that there are, in the
principles of human nature, original and per|manent
varieties which mu&s;t produce remark|able
differences in point of genius.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e varieties it would rather &s;eem
to follow, that genius for &s;cience, and ge|nius
for the arts, are incompatible. But this
would be the contrary extreme: experience
&s;hows that they are not. Not to mention
tho&s;e who have di&s;played genius in &s;cience,
and in the arts mo&s;t analogous to &s;cience, as
tho&s;e who have been both philo&s;ophers and
orators; even more di&s;&s;imilar forms of genius
have been united. Among the ancients, Pam|philus
was at once a painter, and a mathema|tician<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sed primus in pictura omnibus literis eruditus, prae|cipue arithmetica et geometria. PLIN. <HI>Nat. Hi&s;t.</HI> lib. xxxv. cap. 10.</NOTE>. Metrodorus was reckoned one of
the mo&s;t learned philo&s;ophers, and likewi&s;e
one of the mo&s;t &s;kilful painters, that Athens
produced in his time<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eodem tempore erat Metrodorus pictor, idemque philo|&s;ophus, magnae in utraque $cientia auctoritatis. Itaque cum Lucius Paulus, devicto Per&s;eo, petii&s;&s;et ab Athenien&s;ibus, ut quem probati&s;&s;imum philo&s;ophum mitterent &s;ibi, ad erudien|dos liberos, itemque pictorem ad triumphum excolendum, Athenien&s;es Metrodorum elegerunt; pro&s;e&s;&s;i eundem in utro|que de&s;iderio prae&s;tanti&s;&s;imum. PLIN.<HI>ib.</HI> cap. 11.</NOTE>. Among the mo|derns,
Leonardi da Vinci was a painter, &s;culp|tor,
<PB N="429" REF="436">
architect, mu&s;ician, and at the &s;ame time
a chemi&s;t and mathematician. Augu&s;tine
Carrachi was a very good painter, excelled in
engraving, &s;ucceeded in poetry, and &s;howed
a turn al&s;o for mu&s;ic, rhetoric, natural philo|&s;ophy,
and mathematics. It is remarkable
that both Titian's &s;on Horatio, and Parme|giano,
entered &s;o deep into chemical re&s;earches,
as by them to empoveri&s;h them&s;elves.
He garth's <HI>Analy&s;is of Beauty</HI> &s;hows that he
had genius for philo&s;ophical inve&s;tigation;
and his genius in his own art, was very high.
Halley, with a great degree of mathematical,
genius, &s;howed &s;ome degree of the poetical.
Beattie's <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Truth</HI> &s;hows him to be a
philo&s;opher; his genius in poetry is confe&s;&s;ed.
An union of different kinds of genius cannot
take place except when all the a&s;&s;ociating
principles have a con&s;iderable degree of
&s;trength, and the imagination is, at the &s;ame
time capable of a very lively and command|ing
impre&s;&s;ion from the particular end that is
in view. It ari&s;es directly from that <HI>flexibi|lity</HI>
of imagination, which was &s;ufficiently
explained already<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Part II. &s;ect. 8.</NOTE>. Great flexibility join|ed
even to a moderate fancy, will produce a
<PB N="430" REF="437">
little genius in various departments; joined
to a fine imagination, it will enable a man to
excel in various ways: the fine&s;t imagination,
with little flexibility, will be confined to one
way, or at mo&s;t be excellent but in one.</P>
<P>INDEED, even when a per&s;on unites in him|&s;elf
different kinds of genius, it will be gene|rally
found, that he excels only in one de|partment,
and that in others his genius is of
an inferior order. In the &s;ubject to which
his genius is mo&s;t adapted, it exerts it&s;elf
with vigour; it follows the a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciple
which is naturally prevalent. In the
&s;ubject to which it is le&s;s adapted, it operates
more heavily; it follows an a&s;&s;ociating prin|ciple
which is by <HI>foreign</HI> cau&s;es forced into a
temporary predominance. The effects of ge|nius
in the former ca&s;e, are like fruits &s;uit|able
to the climate, which attain their perfect
flavour; in the latter, they are like fruits
rai&s;ed by artificial heat, in a climate not pro|per
for them, which remain in&s;ipid, and ne|ver
reach their full maturity. Under the
guidance of the principle of a&s;&s;ociation na|turally
predominant, the other principles
operate with &s;uch alacrity as &s;ubjects &s;how in
&s;erving their rightful king; under the gui|dance
<PB N="431" REF="438">
of any other principle, their operation
re&s;embles the &s;piritle&s;s backwardne&s;s with
which a people obey an u&s;urper or a con|queror.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on's genius is naturally turned
to one of the&s;e objects, &s;cience or the arts, it
will require very powerful cau&s;es to lead him
to exert it about the other. It will perhaps
be found, that almo&s;t no per&s;on has done &s;o,
except when he was impelled to it by a pecu|liar
education, by very forcible example, by
being thrown into a way of life which required
it, or by circum&s;tances of the like nature.</P>
<P>IT may likewi&s;e be remarked, that, in &s;ome
in&s;tances, perhaps in &s;ome of tho&s;e formerly
produced, the union of the&s;e di&s;&s;imilar forms
of genius, is only apparent, not real. <HI>Ge|nius</HI>
in one way, has been accompanied, not
by the power of invention, but merely by
<HI>capacity,</HI> in the other way. It mu&s;t be own|ed,
that generally Nature is more frugal of
her gifts, than to lavi&s;h on one man, very
unlike modifications of genius. The greate&s;t
inventers in &s;cience, have &s;carce ever &s;hown
genius in the arts. Ari&s;totle was perhaps the
mo&s;t inventive among the ancient philo&s;o|phers;
and his &s;tile, though very preci&s;e,
<PB N="432" REF="439">
exact, and &s;uitable to the &s;ubtility of philo|&s;ophy,
&s;hows a turn of mind, little adapted
either to poetry or to eloquence; even his
critical works di&s;play more of cool judgment,
patient attention, and deep reflection, than of
that ardor of ta&s;te, which never fails to attend
genius for the fine arts. On the other hand,
the greate&s;t geniu&s;es for the arts, have gene|rally
betrayed a want of that preci&s;ion and
depth which are nece&s;&s;ary for &s;cientific inve&s;|tigations.</P>
<P>SOME have &s;uppo&s;ed a di&s;tinctive peculi|arity
&s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed by Nature, on every
man of genius, as to a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;ame
per&s;on can &s;carce excel in two different arts,
however analogous; that no writer, for ex|ample,
ever almo&s;t &s;ucceeded both in ver&s;e
and pro&s;e; nay, that the &s;ame per&s;on cannot
excel in both the &s;pecies of dramatic poetry,
tragedy and comedy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">RAMBLER, No. 169.</NOTE>. In &s;upport of &s;uch
a&s;&s;ertions it is remarked, that none of the
ancients undertook both the&s;e &s;pecies of the
drama; and with the &s;ame view, the wretch|edne&s;s
of the Roman orator's poetry is often
mentioned. It would be unju&s;t, however,
to e&s;timate the compa&s;s of human genius
<PB N="433" REF="440">
from &s;uch in&s;tances. Homer, the father of
the epic poem, hath left a work wholly of the
ludicrous kind. It would perhaps be difficult
to determine whether Shake&s;pear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
greater excellence in tragedy or in comedy;
that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very great excellence in both,
is unque&s;tionable. In both, &s;everal other mo|derns
have &s;hown real genius. Many have
likewi&s;e been both orators and poets. But
after all, it mu&s;t be owned that, in mo&s;t ca&s;es,
a man's genius fits him not only for &s;cience
alone, or for the arts alone, but al&s;o for one
&s;cience, or for one art. Many have &s;hown
genius either in mathematics, or in natural
philo&s;ophy, or in the philo&s;ophy of the mind,
who have di&s;covered none in the re&s;t of the&s;e
branches. It appears from Pope's letters,
that he applied to painting with con&s;iderable
eagerne&s;s, it does not appear that he di&s;co|vered
any great degree of genius for paint|ing;
for mu&s;ic, it is &s;aid that he had not
even a con&s;iderable capacity, though he &s;hows
the quicke&s;t &s;en&s;e of the harmony of ver&s;e;
if it be true, it would appear that, among the
arts, his genius con$ined him almo&s;t wholly
to poetry. In humorous painting, Hogarth
was unrivalled; he attempted portrait-paint|ing,
<PB N="434" REF="441">
it is &s;aid, with the mo&s;t wretched &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems then to be the common, though
not &s;trictly the univer&s;al, law of human na|ture,
that genius fits the per&s;on who is endued
with it, for invention in &s;ome one particular
art, or particular &s;cience. Still, therefore,
there is room for enquiring, by what minuter
varieties of the powers combined in genius,
the&s;e &s;ubordinate differences of its form are
fixt. The enquiry would be laborious and
intricate, but it would be curious, and, per|haps,
not without utility.</P>
