<HEAD>The True State of the CASE BETWEEN The Government, and the Cre|ditors of the Navy, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN a Publick Di&s;ea&s;e, every hand, that has any Skill in the cure, ought to be employ'd. Either the <HI>South-Sea-Trade</HI> as now projected and offered&punc; is a Di&s;ea&s;e upon the Nation, or the temper with which&punc; and manner how we receive it is a Di&s;ea&s;e Alas! how weakly have all the Phy&s;itians of the Stat$ appear'd in their pretended application for a Cure Either the Di&s;temper has not been under&s;tood, o$ the proper Remedies have not been found out, fo$ <HI>this is plain,</HI> the Wound has grow wider and wider the Di&s;ea&s;e has encrea&s;ed, the Fevour $i&s;en higher an$ higher, till it begins to threaten the Health of th$ whole Body, prove Mortal to that Life of the Natio$ our Credit, and in$ect all the Members of the Politic$ Body; however, &s;ince while there is Life, there is &s;om$ Hope, and that it is never too late to apply a Remed$ the de&s;ign of this is to &s;ee, if &s;omething can be do$ to &s;et us to rights in this matter.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
'Tis vain to repeat wherein all the People who have written on this &s;ubject have mi&s;taken, I &s;hall ra|ther &s;ee if &s;omething more effectual can be offered, than complain of the ineffectual endeavours of others, or &s;pend time to enquire, why, and how, they have mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>But in the fir&s;t place, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand the Di&s;ea&s;e, in order to come to a Cure, (and this is the true and only de&s;i$n of this Sheet) which I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, mo&s;t People who have hitherto attempted it have done b$ halves; therefore I call this, <HI>A true State of the Ca&s;e,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Mini&s;try found them&s;elves at their entrance into the Admini&s;tration involv'd in a va $ Debt. which in the Act of Parliament is &s;umm'd up in|clu&s;ive of Intere&s;t at above Eight Millions and a Half, as by the &s;aid Act entituled</P>
<P>will appear. Whoever were the occa&s;ion of this, and by what Errors of their Ad|mini&s;tration, is not our bu&s;ine&s;s here to enquire; but to encrea&s;e the Burthen, the Debt was attended with the&s;e Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was grievous to the Creditor, becau&s;e there was very little pro&s;pect of being re-imbur&s;t their Money.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was grievous to the Government, becau&s;e they found no means in their hands to &s;atisfy it.</P>
<P N="3">3. It was a wound to the Publick Credit, as it made other Debts, <HI>tho' upon good Funds,</HI> be of le&s;s Re|putation.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="5" REF="4">
4. It was a lo&s;s to the Creditors, becau&s;e they could neither receive their Money, (either Principal or Intere&s;t) or &s;ell their Debt without an intolle|rable Di&s;count.</P>
<P N="5">5. It threatned the Publick Peace and Harmony of the Subject; the People who were Sufferers be|ing very Unea&s;ie and Clamourous for their Mo|ney.</P>
<P N="6">6. It was a handle made u&s;e of by a Party again&s;t the Mini&s;try, expecting, and I doubt hoping, that this Debt would plunge them into Difficulties which would be inextricable, and con&s;equently overthrow them.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, and perhaps more Con&s;iderations and Cir|cum&s;tances attending it, put the Mini&s;try upon con&s;i|dering how to &s;atisfy the &s;aid Debt if po&s;&s;ible and thereby quiet the Di&s;content and Unea&s;ine&s;s of the People, who were Sufferers; &s;top the Clamours, de|liver Credit from the&s;e encumberances, and di&s;ap|point tho&s;e who hoped to make their Market of the Unea&s;ine&s;s of the People.</P>
<P>While the Mini&s;try were bu&s;ie contriving ways and means to &s;atisfie this great demand, a thing not very ea&s;ie as times, and the Nations Circum&s;tances &s;tood, Two others, and equally great Undertakings, pre&s;ented, which it was not only for the Honour, but greatly for the Advantage of this Nation to have well and &s;ucce&s;sfully entred upon, and the whole Nation engaged in. The&s;e were,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="5">
1. The &s;ettling an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Collony and Commerce on the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> call'd the <HI>South-Seas.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The erecting a Royal Fi&s;hery in the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Value, Excellency, and Concern to <HI>Britain</HI> of both the&s;e, &s;omething may be &s;aid in its Cour&s;e; in the mean time, it may not be ami&s;s to clear up one Mi&s;take, and which I take to be the fir&s;t Error committed in the entertaining the Propo&s;als made on the&s;e things in Parliament, and to which Mi|&s;take much of our &s;ub&s;equent mi&s;-under&s;tandings about it are owing.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try having with great Application found Funds to E&s;tabli&s;h an Annual Payment of Intere&s;t on the Debts abovemention'd, propo&s;ed them in Parlia|ment, and as thereby they had a&s;certained the Debt, and as it might rea&s;onably have been expected, obliged the Creditors to the highe&s;t Degree, it &s;eem'd a juncture mo&s;t particularly &s;ea&s;onable to the Govern|ment to introduce the two undertakings above, which as before it was very much their concern to have &s;et on foot, it appeared that a &s;mall part of the Debt being a&s;&s;igned from every Hand concern'd, would be a &s;ufficient Fund (the Debts being &s;o great) for carrying on that work, that no injury would be done to any; and yet tho&s;e Two Noble Undertakings might be entred upon with &s;ome advantage, on this Con&s;idera|tion. The <HI>South-Sea Trade</HI> (as we call it) was Tack'd to the Bill at a payment of Ten <HI>per Cent,</HI> and <HI>the Fi&s;hery</HI> at One <HI>per Cent;</HI> when this was introduc'd fir&s;t, it was by &s;ome accepted with &s;o much allacrity, that
<PB N="$" REF="6">
they Sugge&s;ted, (and &s;pread abroad that Sug|ge&s;tion,) That the Mini&s;try calling this an Advan|tage, gave it in as <HI>Addenda</HI> to the Fund in the manner of a recompence to the Creditors for the Lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained in being kept out of their Money; and for this rea&s;on it was given under the term of a Priviledge, and was made exclu|&s;ive; I will not &s;ay but that there was room for this Sugge&s;tion&punc; and it had been but ju&s;t to have received it as &s;uch; be&s;ides that, had they embrac'd the offer chearfully, and &s;et heartily to work with the thing upon that foot, it might have made the Sugge&s;tion true in the Letter, and been a great advantage to the Creditor this way, as it had rai&s;ed the Credit of the Stock, they might have &s;old the Trading Part for above the Payment, and had their whole Principal up|on the Fund Clear; and if this was really in the fir&s;t View, it was very far from being ill reckon|ed.</P>
<P>But there were &s;ome People, who from the beginning of the Propo&s;al found it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to bla&s;t its reputation in its fir&s;t &s;etting out, and nothing gave them a greater handle to that wicked purpo&s;e, than the notion of offering it as an Advantage, That it was thrown in as a Gratification to the Creditors, a Compliment, a Sugar-plumb, and the like, bearing the Title of a Privilege.</P>
<P>To this therefore they grew Sullen, and formed &s;uch an&s;wers as the&s;e;</P>
<P><PB N="$" REF="7">
We are &s;atisfied with your Fund &s;ince you can pay us no otherwi&s;e; we de&s;ire none of your <HI>South Sea</HI> Project, if it be an Advantage to us the Takers, it mu&s;t be &s;ome Di&s;advantage to you the Givers; We are content without it, and you may take the Advantage to your &s;elves: If it be a Compliment, it is lo&s;t upon us, you may &s;pare the Courti&s;ie which is not accepted; If it $e a Sugar-plumb, pray do not force it down Our Throats like a Pill or Potion, and the like.</P>
<P>And indeed they had &s;ome advantage in this Ca&s;e, had they been right, for no Body is &s;uppo&s;ed to force a Compliment upon another; and as the Fund and the Trade were joyned, &s;o that none could &s;hare the Fund that did not &s;ub&s;cribe to the Trade, it &s;ounded har&s;h in the Peoples Ears, to hear that called an Advantage which was made nece&s;&s;ary to them to take; and it became a popular Argument, If it were to our advantage, what need was there of obliging us to do it? it might be &s;uppo&s;ed we would be willing enough to embrace it, if there were vi&s;ible advantages, at lea&s;t there would be no need to force us to it: Sugar-plumbs are never Thru&s;t down Childrens Throats, but put into their Hands, as what there is no fear but they will gladly accept; Pills and bit|ter Draughts indeed require &s;ome Art or Force to compel or oblige them to &s;wallow: Thus they readily in&s;inuated among the Creditors, that this was&punc; &s;ome &s;nare, that the Government made &s;ome advantage by the Propo&s;al, and that the thing might be of ill Con&s;equence to them: By this they gain'd their wicked purpo&s;e, alarm'd
<PB N="9" REF="8">
the People, made them Jealous, Unea&s;y, and ten times more Clamarous than they were before.</P>
<P>This I call the <HI>Fir&s;t Mi&s;take</HI> in this Matter, &s;ince the Truth of the Ca&s;e was this; The Debt was great, the making provi&s;ion for it was what I believe few or none expected, or indeed thought po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t at that time; had they been obliged to give away out of the Sum Ten <HI>per Cent&punc;</HI> which they are now to advance in the Trade to the <HI>South S$a$,</HI> and which remains &s;till their own, and may &s;ometime or other come home with Intere&s;t; I &s;ay had they been obliged to give away Ten <HI>pe Cent,</HI> to the Government, or to <HI>Greenwich</HI> Ho&s;pital, &amp;c. in order to pro|cure &s;uch a &s;ettled Fund for their Debt, they would have gladly accepted of the Fund for the Security of the Principal and Intere&s;t with that Payment; and would have thought them&s;elves well u&s;ed at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>But the Government having its Eye upon &s;et|ling tho&s;e Two Trades, as Undertakings which might in time be very much to the Nations Ho|nour and Advantage, and which have a natural tendency to the encrea&s;e of the Wealth, Strength, and Trade of the Nation, thought it was but rea|&s;onable that tho&s;e People who received &s;o great and &s;o immediate a Benefit by the care which the Government had taken of them, &s;hould make this &s;mall return in Gratitude to the Government <HI>(viz.)</HI> to &s;ub&s;cribe, (not <HI>to Give</HI> but only <HI>Hazard)</HI> Ten Pound <HI>per Cent</HI> of their Money upon &s;uch a Trade: If it were lo&s;t, they gain'd it fir&s;t in the advantage of the Fund, and in the Provi&s;ion made for them, and the Intere&s;t upon their Arrear of In|tere&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="9">
in their Debt; and if any future profit or encrea&s;e ari&s;e from the &s;ucce&s;s of the Enterpri&s;e, the advantage to be all their own.</P>
<P>Had the thing been thus taken, and the Peo|ple been thus appri&s;ed of it, as indeed they ought to have been. I leave it to the Impartial Deter|mination of the mo&s;t prejudiced, whether it would not have met with another kind of Reception than it has hitherto done; and let any impartial Unbyas'd Per&s;on but reflect upon the Circum|&s;tances of their own Debt, the Circum&s;tances of the publck Credit, and of the Nations affairs in General at that Time, and let them an&s;wer but the few following que&s;tions either to me or to them&s;elves, as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. Could you get your Money? Could the Go|vernment pay you?</P>
<P>If you could get your Money, it might be asked, why were the Clamours &s;o great? why the People &s;o Unea&s;y? why Credit &s;o run down on this account? why did you &s;ell your properties in tho&s;e Debts at Thirty to Forty <HI>Per Cent</HI> Di&s;count; and &s;ome at Fifty.</P>
<P N="2">2. Was there really any pro&s;pect of Payment, or rather of any thing but a con&s;tant running in farther and farther, till the Debt would at la&s;t, together with the growing Intere&s;t, have been too big for any Government or Mi|ni&s;try to have undertaken, at lea&s;t while the War had la&s;ted? Nay, if we will give our &s;elves leave to think it mu&s;t one time or other have &s;unk the Government, and have ended the
<PB N="11" REF="10">
War, by de&s;troying Parliamentary Credit, and putting our Affairs into &s;uch Confu&s;ion as that the War could not have been carryed on at all; Nor were our Enemies un&s;en&s;ible of this, as appeared by their contempt of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation on every occa&s;ion of a Treaty, and this they di&s;covered them&s;elves, tho&punc; a Faction among us would have it be plac'd to another account; but it was too plain&punc; as well from our own Circum&s;tances, as from the Words of the <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentiary at the la&s;t Treaty at <HI>Ghertruydenbergh,</HI> when at any time mention was made of <HI>England,</HI> and of the giving Satisfaction to our Queen, they would make a je&s;t of us, and laughing at the propo&s;al, &s;ay, <HI>Pouvres Anglois, Pouvres Anglois, L'on Portent Le Guerre Aux Leurs po&s;&s;ible;</HI> poor <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> poor <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they have carried on the War as long as they are able.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the Cirum&s;tance your Debt was in, would you not have given Ten <HI>per Cent</HI> with all your hearts to have had the Arrear of Intere&s;t added to the Principle, and both &s;ecured on an E&s;ta|bli&s;hed Fund of Intere&s;t by Parliament at Six <HI>per Cent,</HI> till the Principle was paid? I do not &s;uppo&s;e any Negative An&s;wer will be given to this, I mean in general, becau&s;e I cannot in good manners to your under&s;tandings &s;uppo&s;e it; tho' there may be &s;ome wild di&s;tempered Men among us, who in pique at the people they do not like, may an&s;wer, No; But to &s;ay it would be generally &s;o, would be ab&s;urd; for how can I be allow'd to &s;ay you would not give Ten <HI>per Cent</HI> for &s;uch a Fund, when for want
<PB N="12" REF="11">
of it you would &s;ell the whole at forty <HI>pe Cen</HI> Lo&s;s?</P>
<P>If then the&s;e things are true, if this was really the &s;tate of the Ca&s;e, what &s;hall we &s;ay? Suppo&s;e the wor&s;t that any one can &s;ugge&s;t, &s;uppo&s;e the whole Ten <HI>per Cent</HI> which you are Tax'd at <HI>(t$ u&s;e your own term)</HI> for the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade, was to &s;ink, to be lo&s;t to be entirely thrown away, the Project it &s;elf to be abortive, and according to the Cur&s;es dayly wi&s;h't to it, by tho&s;e who ought to have more Wit, &s;hould entirely Mi&s;carry and come to nothing; yet are you not ill u&s;ed&punc; or at all Lo&s;ers by the thing; beca &s;e the Fund of Intere&s;t &s;ettled upon the remainder of your Debt, and upon the Arrear which was before unpaid, and in a manner de&s;perate, is become more worth to you than it was before.</P>
<P>The &s;hort que&s;tion therefore is, not according to the Popular Clamour of the Town&punc; Wh$ do they put us upon this <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade? And why are we forc'd into an Undertaking, &amp;c. Our Pro|perties taken away, our Liberties invaded, our E&s;tates embarra&s;t; No, no, this is the Amu&s;e|ment, but the Ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e, and the Que&s;tion lyes here.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Are you better than you were before, or are you wor&s;e?</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If you are wor&s;e,</HI> leave it, and remain as you were before; and this an&s;wers all the Clamour at a Force, for you are not bound to &s;ub&s;cribe at all: If you do not like it, keep out and &s;tand as you were before; this is the be&s;t wa ythe
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Parliament can find out to make you Satis|faction; the thing they demand of you for it, is but a Trifle, far le&s;s than you would have given to be &s;ecured your Debt, and not a Third of what you did give to one another to &s;ecure it; but that your Liberty may be pre&s;erved, if you are ob&s;tinately re&s;olv'd not to accept of it, you may continue out, no body is forced to come in.</P>
<P>But then, &s;ay they, we are left without any pro|vi&s;ion for our Debt I an&s;wer, And were you not &s;o before? Had you any Confidence in the Parliaments &s;ettling a Fund for &s;o va&s;t a Summ? Was it po&s;&s;ible payments in Cour&s;e would Relieve you? Would not every Year have ad|ded va&s;t Summs both of Principle and Intere&s;t to the Debt? If you had the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of Payment, Why did you &s;ell &s;ome parts at Fifty and Fifty&punc;five <HI>per Cent</HI> Di&s;count, and others at Forty <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P>If you will &s;ay, the Parliament might one time or other do it, that may be &s;aid &s;till; and the mighty encrea&s;e of the Debt being thus Checq'd, the Parliament may now be able to do it, whereas before, had it been left to run on, it would have grown too great in time for the whole Nation: So that you are left ju&s;t where you were if you refu&s;e to come in.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="14" REF="13">
2. <HI>If you are better than you were before,</HI> Then what Rea&s;on for all this Clamour? Why do you Complain? Why refu&s;e to Sub&s;cribe? Why In&s;ult and Affront tho&s;e that have put you in a better State than you were in before.</P>
<P>All this now is upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that your Ten <HI>per Cent</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed to the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade is entirely lo&s;t and thrown away, which is granting for the &s;ake of a froward opponent, more than can in Rea&s;on be in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>If then upon a &s;uppo&s;ition of nothing but Lo&s;s, and the whole Trade, or pro&s;pect of the Trade coming to nothing, there is yet no Injury done, but the Adventurer is left in a better condition than he was in before; much more will this Argu&punc;ment be mainta$n'd again&s;t every kind of Oppo&s;i|tion, if the <HI>South&punc;Sea</HI> Company &s;hould go on with any pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, and a view of al the great things which have been propo&s;ed, &s;hould come nearer to us, Then we &s;hall be Stockjobb'd up as fa&s;t as we are now Stockjobb'd down, and every Adventurer will be able to &s;ell his priviledge of Trading apart from his Debt, perhaps for double, and to be a gainer by the Fund, and a gain|er by the Sub&s;cription al&s;o.</P>
<P>There remains but one Objection that I &s;ee the lea&s;t ground for in return to all this, and that is&punc; (for ought I &s;ee) rai&s;ed, upon Prejudice, to impo&s;e upon Ignorance, both being without Truth, or Fact&punc; the Objection is this:</P>
<P>That tho' Ten <HI>per Cent</HI> is only &s;poken of, t$$ whole Stock is &s;ubjected to the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade
<PB N="15" REF="14">
and may be called in at the plea&s;ure of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company.</P>
<P>This would require much to be &s;aid to it, if this were not a compleat an&s;wer, <HI>(viz.) That it is not True;</HI> And I &s;hall only add, That if the Act of Parliament is not Explicit enough to remove that Doubt, the Charter of the Company is, which being laid open for every one to &s;ee, may &s;peak for it &s;elf, and we need do no more here than re|fer to it.</P>
