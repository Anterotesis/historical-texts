<P>CAN you in earne&s;t a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;|tion?
can you &s;uppo&s;e I ever felt
the lea&s;t degree of love for Sir
George? No, my Rivers, never did your
Emily feel tenderne&s;s till &s;he &s;aw the
<PB N="2" REF="4">
lovelie&s;t, the mo&s;t amiable of his &s;ex, till
tho&s;e eyes &s;poke the &s;entiments of a &s;oul
every idea of which was &s;imilar to her
own.</P>
<P>Yes, my Rivers, our &s;ouls have the
mo&s;t perfect re&s;emblance: I never heard
you &s;peak without finding the feel|ings
of my own heart developed; your
conver&s;ation conveyed your Emily's
ideas, but cloathed in the language of
angels.</P>
<P>I thought well of Sir George; I
&s;aw him as the man de&s;tined to be my
hu&s;band; I fancied he loved me, and
that gratitude obliged me to a re|turn;
carried away by the ardor of
my friends for this marriage, I rather
&s;uffered than approved his addre&s;&s;es;
I had not courage to re&s;i&s;t the torrent,
I therefore gave way to it; I loved
no other, I fancied my want of affec|tion
a native coldne&s;s of temper. I felt
a languid e&s;teem, which I endeavored to
<PB N="3" REF="5">
flatter my&s;elf was love; but the moment
I &s;aw you, the delu&s;ion vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>Your eyes, my Rivers, in one mo|ment
convinced me I had a heart; you
&s;taid &s;ome weeks with us in the coun|try:
with what tran&s;port do I recollect
tho&s;e plea&s;ing moments! how did my
heart beat whenever you approached
me! what charms did I find in your
conver&s;ation! I heard you talk with a
delight of which I was not mi&s;tre&s;s. I
fancied every woman who &s;aw you, felt
the &s;ame emotions: my tenderne&s;s in|crea&s;ed
imperceptibly without my per|ceiving
the con&s;equences of my indulg|ing
the dear plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you.</P>
<P>I found I loved, yet was doubtful of
your &s;entiments; my heart, however, flat|tered
me yours was equally affected;
my &s;ituation prevented an explanation;
but love has a thou&s;and ways of making
him&s;elf under&s;tood.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
How dear to me were tho&s;e &s;oft, tho&s;e
delicate attentions, which told me all you
felt for me, without communicating it to
others!</P>
<P>Do you remember that day, my Ri|vers,
when, &s;itting in the little hawthorn
grove, near the borders of the river,
the re&s;t of the company, of which Sir
George was one, ran to look at a &s;hip
that was pa&s;&s;ing: I would have follow|ed;
you a&s;ked me to &s;tay, by a look
which it was impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take;
nothing could be more imprudent than
my &s;tay, yet I had not re&s;olution to
refu&s;e what I &s;aw gave you plea&s;ure:
I &s;tayed; you pre&s;&s;ed my hand, you
regarded me with a look of unutter|able
love.</P>
<P>My Rivers, from that dear moment your
Emily vowed never to be another's: &s;he
vowed not to &s;acrifice all the happine&s;s of
her life to a romantic parade of fidelity
<PB N="5" REF="7">
to a man whom &s;he had been betrayed
into receiving as a lover; &s;he re&s;olved,
if nece&s;&s;ary, to own to him the tender|ne&s;s
with which you had in&s;pired her, to
entreat from his e&s;teem, from his compa&s;|&s;ion,
a relea&s;e from engagements which
made her wretched.</P>
<P>My heart burns with the love of virtue,
I am tremblingly alive to fame: what bit|terne&s;s
then mu&s;t have been my portion
had I fir&s;t &s;een you when the wife of ano|ther!</P>
<P>Such is the powerful &s;ympathy that
unites us, that I fear, that virtue, that
&s;trong &s;en&s;e of honor and fame, &s;o power|ful
in minds mo&s;t turned to tenderne&s;s,
would only have &s;erved to make more
poignant the pangs of hopele&s;s, de&s;pairing
love.</P>
<P>How ble&s;t am I, that we met before my
&s;ituation made it a crime to love you! I
<PB N="6" REF="8">
&s;hudder at the idea how wretched I might
have been, had I &s;een you a few months
later.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t returned from a vi&s;it at a few
miles di&s;tance. I find a letter from my
dear Bell, that &s;he will be here to-mor|row;
how do I long to &s;ee her, to talk
to her of my Rivers!</P>
<CLOSER>I am interrupted.
Adieu! Yours,

<P>I HAVE this moment, my dear Mrs.
Temple's letter: &s;he will imagine my
tran&s;port at the happy event &s;he men|tions;
my dear Rivers has, in &s;ome de|gree,
&s;acrificed even filial affection to
his tenderne&s;s for me; the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s

I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have &s;elt, at

<P>I &s;hould be ble&s;t indeed, my amiable

<P>There is no di&s;tre&s;s, no want, I could

worth keeping.</P>
<P>Could I bear to &s;ee tho&s;e looks of ar|dent

<P>You will, my deare&s;t friend, pity a

<HEAD>LETTER CLXXXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Captain FITZGERALD.
<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Sept. 17.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;ay true, my dear Fitzgerald:
friend&s;hip, like love, is more the
child of &s;ympathy than of rea&s;on; though
in&s;pired by qualities very oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="12">
which give love, it &s;trikes like that in
a moment: like that, it is free as air,
and, when con&s;trained, lo&s;es all its
&s;pirit.</P>
<P>In both, from &s;ome namele&s;s cau&s;e,
at lea&s;t &s;ome cau&s;e to us incomprehen|&s;ible,
the affections take fire the in&s;tant
two per&s;ons, who&s;e minds are in uni&s;on,
ob&s;erve each other, which, however, they
may often meet without doing.</P>
<P>It is therefore as impo&s;&s;ible for others
to point out objects of our friend&s;hip as
love; our choice mu&s;t be uninfluenced, if
we wi&s;h to find happine&s;s in either.</P>
<P>Cold, lifele&s;s e&s;teem may grow from
a long ta&s;tele&s;s acquaintance; but real
affection makes a &s;udden and lively im|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This impre&s;&s;ion is improved, is &s;trength|ened
by time, and a more intimate know|ledge
<PB N="11" REF="13">
of the merit of the per&s;on who
makes it; but it is, it mu&s;t be, &s;ponta|neous,
or be nothing.</P>
<P>I felt this &s;ympathy powerfully in re|gard
to your&s;elf; I had the &s;tronge&s;t par|tiality
for you before I knew how very
worthy you were of my e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Your countenance and manner made an
impre&s;&s;ion on me, which inclined me to
take your virtues upon tru&s;t.</P>
<P>It is not always &s;afe to depend on the&s;e
preventive feelings; but in general the
face is a pretty faithful index of the
mind.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e being in town in four or five
days.</P>
<P>Twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>My mother has this moment a &s;econd
$word$ from her relation, who is coming
<PB N="12" REF="14">
home, and propo&s;es a 'marriage between
me and his daughter, to whom he will
give twenty thou&s;and pounds now, and
the re&s;t of his fortune at his death.</P>
<P>As Emily's fault, if love can allow
her one, is an exce&s;s of romantic ge|nero&s;ity,
the fault of mo&s;t uncorrupt|ed
female minds, I am very anxious
to marry her before &s;he knows of this
propo&s;al, left &s;he &s;hould think it a
proof of tenderne&s;s to aim at making
me wretched, in order to make me
rich.</P>
<P>I therefore entreat you and Mrs. Fitz|gerald
to &s;tay at Ro&s;e-hill, and prevent
her coming to town, till &s;he is mine pa&s;t
the power of retreat.</P>
<P>Our relation may have mentioned his
de&s;ign to per&s;ons le&s;s prudent than our
little party; and &s;he may hear of it, if &s;he
is in London.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15">
But, independently of my fear of her
&s;pirit of romance, I feel that it would be
an indelicacy to let her know of this pro|po&s;al
at pre&s;ent, and look like attempting
to make a merit of my refu&s;al.</P>
<P>It is not to you, my dear friend, I need
&s;ay the gifts of fortune are nothing to me
without her for who&s;e &s;ake alone I wi&s;h
to po&s;&s;e&s;s them: you know my heart, and
you al&s;o know this is the &s;entiment of
every man who loves.</P>
<P>But I can with truth &s;ay much more;
I do not even wi&s;h an increa&s;e of for|tune,
con&s;idering it ab&s;tractedly from
its being incompatible with my mar|riage
with the lovelie&s;t of women; I
am indifferent to all but independence;
wealth would not make me happier;
on the contrary, it might break in on
my pre&s;ent little plan of enjoyment, by
forcing me to give to common ac|quaintance,
of whom wealth will al|ways
attract a crowd, tho&s;e precious
<PB N="14" REF="16">
hours devoted to friend&s;hip and dome&s;tic
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I think my pre&s;ent income ju&s;t what a
wi&s;e man would wi&s;h, and very &s;incerely
join in the philo&s;ophical prayer of the
royal prophet, &startq;Give me neither poverty
nor riches.&endq;</P>
<P>I love the vale, and had always an
aver&s;ion to very exten&s;ive pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>I will ha&s;ten my coming as much as
po&s;&s;ible, and hope to be at Ro&s;e-hill on
Monday next: I &s;hall be a prey to anxiety
till Emily is irrevocably mine.</P>
<P>Tell Mrs. Fitzgerald, I am all impa|tience
to ki&s;s her hand.</P>

<P>I AM this moment returned to Rich|mond
from a journey: I am rejoiced
at your arrival, and impatient to &s;ee you;
for I am &s;o happy as not to have out-lived
my impatience.</P>
<P>How is my little Bell? I am as much
in love with her as ever; this you will con|ceal
from Captain Fitzgerald, le&s;t he
&s;hould be alarmed, for I am as formidable
a rival as a man of four&s;core can be &s;up|po&s;ed
to be.</P>
<P>I am extremely obliged to you, my dear
Fermor, for having introduced me to a
very amiable man, in your friend Colonel
Rivers.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
I begin to be &s;o &s;en&s;ible I am an old
fellow, that I feel a very lively degree of
gratitude to the young ones who vi&s;it me;
and look on every agreeable new acquain|tance
under thirty as an acqui&s;ition I had
no right to expect.</P>
<P>You know I have always thought per|&s;onal
advantages of much more real value
than accidental ones; and that tho&s;e who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the former had much the greate&s;t
right to be proud.</P>
<P>Youth, health, beauty, under&s;tanding,
are &s;ub&s;tantial goods; wealth and title
comparatively ideal ones; I therefore
think a young man who conde&s;cends to vi|&s;it
an old one, the healthy who vi&s;it the
&s;ick, the man of &s;en&s;e who &s;pends his time
with a fool, and even a hand&s;ome fellow
with an ugly one, are the per&s;ons who con|fer
the favor, whatever difference there
may be in rank or fortune.</P>
<P>Colonel Rivers did me the honor to
&s;pend a day with me here, and I have not
<PB N="17" REF="19">
often lately pa&s;&s;ed a plea&s;anter one: the
de&s;ire I had not to di&s;credit your partial
recommendation, and my very &s;trong in|clinations
to &s;educe him to come again,
made me intirely di&s;card the old man; and
I believe your friend will tell you the hours
did not pa&s;s on leaden wings.</P>
<P>I expect you, with Mr. and Mrs. Fitz|gerald,
to pa&s;s &s;ome time with me at Rich|mond.</P>

<P>SINCE I &s;ent away my letter, I have
your la&s;t.</P>
<P>You tell me, my dear Rivers, the &s;trong
emotion I betrayed at &s;eeing Sir George,
when you came together to Montreal,
made you fear I loved him; that you were
jealous of the blu&s;h which glowed on my
cheek, when he entered the room: that
you &s;till remember it with regret; that
you &s;till fancy I had once &s;ome degree of
tenderne&s;s for him, and beg me to account
for the apparent confu&s;ion I betrayed at
his &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">
I own that emotion; my confu&s;ion was
indeed too great to be concealed: but
was he alone, my Rivers? can you forget
that he had with him the mo&s;t lovely of
mankind?</P>
<P>Sir George was hand&s;ome; I have often
regarded his per&s;on with admiration, but
it was the admiration we give to a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>I li&s;tened coldly to his love, I felt no
emotion at his &s;ight; but when you ap|peared,
my heart beat, I blu&s;hed, I turned
pale by turns, my eyes a&s;&s;umed a new &s;oft|ne&s;s,
I trembled, and every pul&s;e confe&s;&s;ed
the ma&s;ter of my &s;oul.</P>

<P>NO, Emily, you never loved; I have

<P>You cannot &s;urely have been influenced

richer than an oriental monarch.</P>
<P>Short as life is, my deare&s;t girl, is it of

wealth $word$ all e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s?</P>

The tender affections are the only

and of father: it is from the dear
&s;oft ties of &s;ocial love your Rivers expects
his felicity.</P>
<P>You have but one way, my dear Emily,
to convince me of your tenderne&s;s: I

<P>I am hurt beyond words, at the

<P><PB N="54" REF="56">
I am more and more plea&s;ed with the
way of life I have cho&s;e; and, were my

I would only enlarge my hou&s;e, and fill it
with friends.</P>
<P>My &s;ituation is a very fine one, though
not like the magnificent &s;cenes to which
we have been accu&s;tomed in Canada:
the hou&s;e &s;tands on the &s;unny &s;ide of
a hill, at the foot of which, the garden
intervening, runs a little trout &s;tream,
which to the right &s;eems to be lo&s;t in an
i&s;land of oziers, and over which is a ru&s;tic
bridge into a very beautiful meadow,
where at pre&s;ent graze a numerous flock
of &s;heep.</P>
<P>Emily is planning a thou&s;and em|belli&s;hments
for the garden, and will
next year make it a wilderne&s;s of &s;weets,
a paradi&s;e worthy its lovely inhabitant:
&s;he is already forming walks and flowery
arbors in the wood, and giving the whole
<PB N="55" REF="57">
&s;cene every charm which ta&s;te, at little
expence, can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>I, on my &s;ide, am &s;electing &s;pots for
plantations of trees; and mean, like a
good citizen, to &s;erve at once my&s;elf
and the public, by rai&s;ing oaks, which
may hereafter bear the Briti&s;h thunder to
di&s;tant lands.</P>
<P>I believe we country gentlemen, whil&s;t
we have &s;pirit to keep our&s;elves indepen|dent,

of di&s;hone&s;t ambition; and therefore di&s;|turb
no government to &s;erve our private

<P><PB N="56" REF="58">
It is the profu&s;e, the vicious, the profli|gate,

<P>That love of order, of moral harmony,

<P>I EVERY hour &s;ee more &s;trongly, my

be worn out by a multitude of intrigues
before marriage.</P>
<P>Temple loves my &s;i&s;ter, he is happy
with her; but his happine&s;s is by no means
of the &s;ame kind with yours and mine;
&s;he is beautiful, and he thinks her &s;o;
&s;he is amiable, and he e&s;teems her; he
prefers her to all other women, but he
feels nothing of that trembling delicacy
of &s;entiment, that quick &s;en&s;ibility, which
gives to love its mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures,
and which I would not give up for the
wealth of worlds.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61">
His affection is meer pa&s;&s;ion, and there|fore
&s;ubject to change; ours is that heart|felt
tenderne&s;s, which time renders every
moment more plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The tumult of de&s;ire is the fever of
the &s;oul; its health, that delicious tran|quillity
where the heart is gently moved,
not violently agitated; that tranquillity
which is only to be found where friend|&s;hip
is the ba&s;is of love, and where we
are happy without injuring the object be|loved:
in other words, in a marriage of
choice.</P>
<P>In the voyage of life, pa&s;&s;ion is the
tempe&s;t, love the gentle gale.</P>
<P>Di&s;&s;ipation, and a continual round of
amu&s;ements at home, will probably &s;e|cure
my &s;i&s;ter all of Temple's heart which
remains; but his love would grow lan|guid

<HEAD>LETTER CXCIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Colonel RIVERS, Bellfield, Rutland.
<DATE>Oct. 19.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING, my dear Rivers, &s;hews
the value of friend&s;hip more than
the envy it excites.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63">
The world will &s;ooner pardon us any
advantage, even wealth, genius, or beauty,
than that of having a faithful friend;
every &s;elfi&s;h bo&s;om &s;wells with envy at the
&s;ight of tho&s;e &s;ocial connexions, which are
the cordials of life, and of which our
narrow prejudices alone prevent our en|joyment.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have neither hearts to feel
this generous affection, nor merit to de|&s;erve
it, hate all who are in this re&s;pect
happier than them&s;elves; they look on a
friend as an invaluable ble&s;&s;ing, and a
ble&s;&s;ing out of their reach; and abhor all
who po&s;&s;e&s;s the trea&s;ure for which they
&s;igh in vain.</P>
<P>For my own part, I had rather be the
dupe of a thou&s;and fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of
friend&s;hip, than, for fear of being de|ceived,
give up the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64">
Dupes are happy at lea&s;t for a time;
but the cold, narrow, &s;u&s;picious heart ne|ver
knows the glow of &s;ocial plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame proportion as we lo&s;e our
confidence in the virtues of others, we lo&s;e
our proper happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation of this mean jealou&s;y,
&s;o humiliating to human nature, has in|fluenced
Lord Halifax, in his Advice to
a Daughter, the &s;chool of art, prudery,
and &s;elfi&s;h morals, to caution her again&s;t
all friend&s;hips, or, as he calls them, <HI>dear|ne&s;&s;es,</HI>
as what will make the world envy
and hate her.</P>
<P>After my &s;weet Bell's tenderne&s;s, I
know no plea&s;ure equal to your friend|&s;hip;
nor would I give it up for the reve|nue
of an ea&s;tern monarch.</P>
<P>I e&s;teem Temple, I love his conver&s;a|tion;
he is gay and amu&s;ing; but I &s;hall
<PB N="63" REF="65">
never have for him the affection I feel for
you.</P>
<P>I think you are too apprehen&s;ive in re|gard
to your &s;i&s;ter's happine&s;s: he loves
her, and there is a certain variety in
her manner, a kind of agreeable ca|price,
that I think will &s;ecure the heart
of a man of his turn, much more than
her merit, or even the loveline&s;s of her
per&s;on.</P>
<P>She is hand&s;ome, exqui&s;itely &s;o; hand|&s;omer
than Bell, and, if you will allow
me to &s;ay &s;o, than Emily.</P>
<P>I mean, that &s;he is &s;o in the eye of
a painter; for in that of a lover his
mi&s;tre&s;s is the only beautiful object on
earth.</P>
<P>I allow your &s;i&s;ter to be very lovely,
but I think Bell more de&s;ireable a thou|&s;and
times; and, rationally &s;peaking, &s;he
who has, <HI>as to me,</HI> the art of in&s;piring
<PB N="64" REF="66">
the mo&s;t tenderne&s;s is, <HI>as to me,</HI> to all
intents and purpo&s;es the mo&s;t beautiful
woman.</P>
<P>In which faith I choo&s;e to live and die.</P>
<P>I have an idea, Rivers, that you and I
&s;hall continue to be happy: a real &s;ym|pathy,
a lively ta&s;te, mixed with e&s;teem,
led us to marry; the delicacy, tenderne&s;s,
and virtue, of the two mo&s;t charming of
women, promi&s;e to keep our love alive.</P>
<P>We have both &s;trong affections: both
love the conver&s;ation of women; and nei|ther
of our hearts are depraved by ill|cho&s;en
connexions with the &s;ex.</P>

<DATELINE>London, <DATE>Oct. 19.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I DIE to come to Bellfield again, my
dear Rivers; I have a pa&s;&s;ion for
your little wood; it is a mighty pretty
wood for an Engli&s;h wood, but nothing
to your Montmorencis; the dear little
Silleri too&mdash;</P>
<P>But to return to the &s;hades of Bellfield:
your little wood is charming indeed; not
to particularize detached pieces of your
&s;cenery, the <HI>tout en&s;emble</HI> is very in|viting;
ob&s;erve, however, I have to
<PB N="66" REF="68">
notion of paradi&s;e without an Adam, and
therefore &s;hall bring Fitzgerald with me
next time.</P>
<P>What could induce you, with this &s;weet
little retreat, to cro&s;s that vile ocean to
Canada? I am a&s;toni&s;hed at the madne&s;s
of mankind, who can expo&s;e them&s;elves
to pain, mi&s;ery, and danger; and range
the world from motives of avarice and
ambition, when the rural cot, the fan|ning
gale, the clear &s;tream, and flowery
bank, offer &s;uch delicious enjoyments at
home.</P>
<P>You men are horrid, rapacious animals,
with your &s;pirit of enterprize, and your
non&s;en&s;e: ever wanting more land than
you can cultivate, and more money than
you can &s;pend.</P>
<P>That eternal pur&s;uit of gain, that rage
of accumulation, in which you are edu|cated,
corrupts your hearts, and robs you
of half the plea&s;ures of life.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69">
I &s;hould not, however, make &s;o free
with the &s;ex, if you and my <HI>caro &s;po&s;o</HI> were
not exceptions.</P>
<P>You two have really &s;omething of the
&s;en&s;ibility and genero&s;ity of women.</P>
<P>Do you know, Rivers, I have a fancy
you and Fitzgerald will always be happy
hu&s;bands? this is &s;omething owing to
your&s;elves, and &s;omething to us; you
have both that manly tenderne&s;s, and
true genero&s;ity, which inclines you to
love creatures who have paid you the
compliment of making their happine&s;s or
mi&s;ery depend entirely on you, and partly
to the little circum&s;tance of your being
married to two of the mo&s;t agreeable wo|men
breathing.</P>
<P>To &s;peak <HI>en philo&s;ophe,</HI> my dear Rivers,
you are not to be told, that the fire of
love, like any other fire, is equally put
out by too much or too little fuel.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70">
Now Emily and I, without vanity, be|&s;ides
our being hand&s;ome and amazingly
&s;en&s;ible, to &s;ay nothing of our plea&s;ing
kind of &s;en&s;ibility, have a certain ju&s;t idea
of cau&s;es and effects, with a natural blu&s;h|ing
re&s;erve, and bridal delicacy, which I
am apt to flatter my&s;elf&mdash;</P>
<P>Do you under&s;tand me, Rivers? I
am not quite clear I under&s;tand my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>All that I would in&s;inuate is, that Emily
and I are, take us for all in all, the two
mo&s;t charming women in the world, and
that, whoever leaves us, mu&s;t change im|men&s;ely
for the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>I believe Lucy equally plea&s;ing, but I
think her charms have not &s;o good a &s;ub|ject
to work upon.</P>
<P>Temple is a hand&s;ome fellow, and loves
her; but he has not the tenderne&s;s of
<PB N="69" REF="71">
heart that I &s;o much admire in two certain
youths of my acquaintance.</P>
<P>He is rich indeed; but who cares?</P>
<P>Certainly, my dear Rivers, nothing can
be more ab&s;urd, or more de&s;tructive to
happine&s;s, than the very wrong turn we
give our childrens imaginations about
marriage.</P>
<P>If mi&s;s and ma&s;ter are good, &s;he is pro|mi&s;ed
a rich hu&s;band, and a coach and &s;ix,
and he a wi&s;e with a mon&s;trous great for|tune.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e fine promi&s;es mu&s;t fail;
and where they do not, the poor things
have only the con&s;olation of finding, when
too late to retreat, that the objects to
which all their wi&s;hes were pointed have
really nothing to do with happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Is there a nabobe&s;s on earth half as
happy as the two fooli&s;h little girls about
<PB N="70" REF="72">

<P>YOU ridicule my enthu&s;ia&s;m, my dear

is no exertion of the human mind, no effort
of the under&s;tanding, imagination, or
heart, without a &s;park of this divine fire.</P>
<P>Without enthu&s;ia&s;m, genius, virtue,
plea&s;ure, even love it&s;elf, langui&s;hes; all
that refines, adorns, &s;oftens, exalts, enno|bles
life, has its &s;ource in this animating
principle.</P>
<P>I glory in being an enthu&s;ia&s;t in every
thing; but in nothing &s;o much as in my
tenderne&s;s for this charming woman.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">
I am a perfect Quixote in love, and
would &s;torm enchanted ca&s;tles, and fight
giants, for my Emily.</P>
<P>Coldne&s;s of temper damps every &s;pring
that moves the human heart; it is equally
an enemy to plea&s;ure, riches, fame, to all
which is worth living for.</P>
<P>I thank you for your wi&s;hes that I was
rich, but am by no means anxious my&s;elf
on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>You &s;ons of fortune, who po&s;&s;e&s;s
your thou&s;ands a year, and find them
too little for your de&s;ires, de&s;ires
which grow from that very abundance,
imagine every man mi&s;erable who
wants them; in which you are greatly
mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Every real plea&s;ure is within the reach
of my little fortune, and I am very indif|ferent
<PB N="73" REF="75">
about tho&s;e which borrow their
charms, not from nature, but from fa&s;hion
and caprice.</P>
<P>My hou&s;e is indeed le&s;s than yours;
but it is finely &s;ituated, and large enough
for my fortune: that part of it which
belongs peculiarly to my Emily is ele|gant.</P>
<P>I have an equipage, not for parade
but u&s;e; and the lovelie&s;t of women
prefers it with me to all that luxury
and magnificence could be&s;tow with
another.</P>
<P>The flowers in my garden bloom
as fair, the peach glows as deep, as
in yours: does a flower blu&s;h more
lovely, or &s;mell more &s;weet; a peach
look more tempting than its fellows, I
&s;elect it for my Emily, who receives
it with delight, as the tender tribute
of love.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">
In &s;ome re&s;pects, we are the more
happy for being le&s;s rich: the little
avocations, which our mediocrity of for|tune
makes nece&s;&s;ary to both, are the
be&s;t preventives of that languor, from
being too con&s;tantly together, which is
all that love founded on ta&s;te and friend|&s;hip
has to fear.</P>
<P>Had I my choice, I &s;hould wi&s;h for
a very &s;mall addition only to my in|come,
and that for the &s;ake of others,
not my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I love plea&s;ure, and think it our
duty to make life as agreeable as is con|&s;i&s;tent
with what we owe to others;
but a true plea&s;urable philo&s;opher &s;eeks
his enjoyments where they are really
to be found; not in the gratifications
of a childi&s;h pride, but of tho&s;e affec|tions
which are born with us, and which
are the only rational &s;ources of enjoy|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77">
When I am walking in the&s;e deli|cious
&s;hades with Emily; when I &s;ee
tho&s;e lovely eyes, &s;oftened with art|le&s;s
fondne&s;s, and hear the mu&s;ic of
that voice; when a thou&s;and trifles, un|ob&s;erved
but by the prying &s;ight of
love, betray all the dear &s;en&s;ations of
that bo&s;om, where truth and delicate
tenderne&s;s have fixed their &s;eat, I know
not the Epicurean of whom I do not de|&s;erve
to be the envy.</P>
<P>Does your fortune, my dear Temple,
make you more than happy? if not
why &s;o very earne&s;tly wi&s;h an addition
to mine? believe me, there is nothing
about which I am more indifferent. I
am ten times more anxious to get the
fine&s;t collection of flowers in the world
for my Emily.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve ju&s;tly, that there is no|thing
&s;o in&s;ipid as women who have con|ver&s;ed
with women only; let me add,
<PB N="76" REF="78">

<P>The de&s;ire of plea&s;ing on each &s;ide, in

all the graces of the per&s;on and under|&s;tanding,
all the amiable &s;entiments of

<P>Rivers ye&s;terday was throwing flowers
at me and Lucy, in play, as we were
walking in the garden; I catched a wall-flower,
<PB N="80" REF="82">
and, by an involuntary impul&s;e,
ki&s;&s;ed it, and placed it in my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved me, and his look of plea|&s;ure
and affection is impo&s;&s;ible to be de|&s;cribed.
What exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure there is
in the&s;e agreeable follies!</P>
<P>He is the &s;weete&s;t trifler in the world,
my dear Bell: but in what does he not
excel all mankind!</P>
<P>As the &s;ea&s;on of autumnal flowers is
almo&s;t over, he is &s;ending for all tho&s;e
which blow early in the &s;pring: he pre|vents
every wi&s;h his Emily can form.</P>
<P>Did you ever, my dear, &s;ee &s;o fine an
autumn as this? you will, perhaps, &s;mile
when I &s;ay, I never &s;aw one &s;o plea&s;ing;
&s;uch a &s;ea&s;on is more lovely than even the

<P>Why then &s;hould we not do our be&s;t to

<P>You will &s;ee this is a preface to a very

take notice, I will not admit even bu&s;ine&s;s

<P>I am ju&s;t come from a walk in the

<P>There is &s;omething very plea&s;ing in

too fa&s;t.</P>
<P>The dryne&s;s of the air, the &s;oft we&s;tern
breeze, the tremulous motion of the fall|ing
leaves, the ru&s;tling of tho&s;e already
fallen under our feet, their variety of
lively colors, give a certain &s;pirit and agree|able
fluctuation to the &s;cene, which is un|&s;peakably plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>By the way, we people of warm ima|ginations
have va&s;t advantages over
others; we &s;corn to be confined to pre|&s;ent

<P>I am &s;orry for what you tell me of Mi&s;s

into indi&s;cretions.</P>
<P>'Tis too common to &s;ee the mo&s;t inno|cent,
nay, even the mo&s;t laudable actions
cen&s;ured by the world; as we cannot,
however, eradicate the prejudices of
others, it is wi&s;dom to yield to them in
things which are indifferent.</P>
<P>One ought to conform to, and re&s;pect
the cu&s;toms, as well as the laws and reli|gion
of our country, where they are not
contrary to virtue, and to that moral &s;en&s;e
<PB N="85" REF="87">
which Heaven has imprinted on our &s;ouls;
where they are contrary, every generous
mind will de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P>I agree with you, my dear friend, that
two per&s;ons who love, not only <HI>&s;eem,</HI> but
really are, hand&s;omer to each other than
to the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>When we look at tho&s;e we ardently
love, a new &s;oftne&s;s &s;teals unperceived
into the eyes, the countenance is more
animated, and the whole form has that air
of tender languor which has &s;uch charms
for &s;en&s;ible minds.</P>
<P>To prove the truth of this, my Emily
approaches, fair as the ri&s;ing morn, led by
the hand of the Graces; &s;he fees her lover,
and every charm is redoubled; an invo|luntary

a pa&s;&s;ion, which is the pride of my &s;oul.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Captain FITZGERALD.
Three o'clock.</OPENER>
<P>WE are returned, and have met
with an adventure, which I mu&s;t
tell you.</P>
<P>About &s;ix miles from home, at the en|trance
of a &s;mall village, as I was riding
very fa&s;t, a little before the chai&s;e, a boy
about four years old, beautiful as a Cupid,
came out of a cottage on the right-hand,
and, running cro&s;s the road, fell almo&s;t
under my hor&s;e's feet.</P>
<P>I threw my&s;elf off in a moment; and
&s;natching up the child, who was, however,
unhurt, carried him to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90">
I was met at the door by a young wo|man,
plainly dre&s;t; but of a form un|commonly
elegant: &s;he had &s;een the
child fall, and her terror for him was
plainly marked in her countenance; &s;he
received him from me, pre&s;&s;ed him to her
bo&s;om, and, without &s;peaking, melted
into tears.</P>
<P>My mother and Emily had by this time
reached the cottage; the humanity of both
was too much intere&s;ted to let them pa&s;s:
they alighted, came into the hou&s;e, and
enquired about the child, with an air of
tenderne&s;s which was not lo&s;t on the
young per&s;on, whom we &s;uppo&s;ed his
mother.</P>
<P>She appeared about two and twenty,
was hand&s;ome, with an air of the world,
which the plainne&s;s of her dre&s;s could
not hide; her countenance was pen&s;ive,
with a mixture of &s;en&s;ibility which in|&s;tantly
prejudiced us all in her favor;
<PB N="89" REF="91">
her look &s;eemed to &s;ay, &s;he was un|happy,
and that &s;he de&s;erved to be
otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Her manner was re&s;pectful, but ea&s;y
and uncon&s;trained; polite, without being
&s;ervile; and &s;he acknowledged the intere&s;t
we all &s;eemed to take in what related to
her, in a manner that convinced us &s;he
de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>Though every thing about us, the
extreme neatne&s;s, the elegant &s;impli|city
of her hou&s;e and little garden, her
own per&s;on, that of the child, both per|fectly
genteel, her politene&s;s, her air
of the world, in a cottage like that of
the meane&s;t laborer, tended to excite
the mo&s;t lively curio&s;ity; neither good-breeding,
humanity, nor the re&s;pect
due to tho&s;e who appear unfortunate,
would allow us to make any enquiries:
we left the place full of this adventure,
convinced of the merit, as well as un|happine&s;s,
<PB N="90" REF="92">
of its fair inhabitant, and re|&s;olved
to find out, if po&s;&s;ible, whether
her misfortunes were of a kind to be alle|viated,
and within our little power to al|leviate.</P>
<P>I will own to you, my dear Fitzgerald,
I at that moment felt the &s;mallne&s;s of my
fortune: and I believe Emily had the
&s;ame &s;en&s;ations, though her delicacy pre|vented
her naming them to me, who have
made her poor.</P>
<P>We can talk of nothing but the
&s;tranger; and Emily is determined to
call on her again to-morrow, on pretence
of enquiring after the health of the
child.</P>
<P>I tremble le&s;t her &s;tory, for &s;he cer|tainly
has one, &s;hould be &s;uch as, how|ever
it may entitle her to compa&s;&s;ion, may
<PB N="91" REF="93">
make it impo&s;&s;ible for Emily to &s;hew it in

<P>WE have been again at the cottage;
and are more convinced than ever,
that this amiable girl is not in the &s;tation
in which &s;he was born; we &s;taid two hours,
and varied the conver&s;ation in a manner
which, in &s;pite of her extreme mode&s;ty,
<PB N="92" REF="94">
made it impo&s;&s;ible for her to avoid &s;hew|ing
&s;he had been educated with uncom|mon
care: her &s;tyle is correct and ele|gant;
her &s;entiments noble, yet unaf|fected;
we talked of books, &s;he &s;aid
little on the &s;ubject; but that little &s;hew|ed
a ta&s;te which a&s;toni&s;hed us.</P>
<P>Anxious as we are to know her true
&s;ituation, in order, if &s;he merits it, to
endeavor to &s;erve her, yet delicacy
made it impo&s;&s;ible for us to give the
lea&s;t hint of a curio&s;ity which might
make her &s;uppo&s;e we entertained ideas to
her prejudice.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed greatly affected with the
humane concern Emily expre&s;&s;ed for
the child's danger ye&s;terday, as well as
with the polite and even affectionate
manner in which &s;he appeared to intere&s;t
her&s;elf in all which related to her;
Emily made her general offers of &s;er|vice
with a timid kind of &s;oftne&s;s in
her air, which &s;eemed to &s;peak rather
<PB N="93" REF="95">
a per&s;on a&s;king a favor than wi&s;hing to
confer an obligation.</P>
<P>She thanked my &s;weet Emily with a
look of &s;urprize and gratitude to which it
is not ea&s;y to do ju&s;tice; there was, how|ever,
an embarra&s;&s;ment in her countenance
at tho&s;e offers, which a little alarms me;
&s;he ab&s;olutely declined coming to Bell|field:
I know not what to think.</P>
<P>Emily, who has taken a &s;trong preju|dice
in her favor, will an&s;wer for her con|duct
with her life; but I will own to you,
I am not without my doubts.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider the inhuman arts of
the abandoned part of one &s;ex, and the
romantic genero&s;ity and too unguarded
confidence, of the mo&s;t amiable of the
other; when I reflect that where women
love, they love without re&s;erve; that
they fondly imagine the man who is dear
to them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every virtue; that
their very integrity of mind prevents
<PB N="94" REF="96">
their &s;u&s;picions; when I think of her
pre&s;ent retirement, &s;o apparently ill &s;uited
to her education; when I &s;ee her beau|ty,
her elegance of per&s;on, with that
tender and melancholy air, &s;o &s;trongly
expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;i|bility;
when, in &s;hort, I &s;ee the child,
and ob&s;erve her fondne&s;s for him, I
have fears for her, which I cannot con|quer.</P>
<P>I am as firmly convinced as Emily of
the goodne&s;s of her heart; but I am
not &s;o certain that even that very good|ne&s;s
may not have been, from an unhappy
concurrence of circum&s;tances, her misfor|tune.</P>
<P>We have company to dine.</P>
<P>Adieu! till the evening.</P>

<OPENER>&startq;To Mrs. RIVERS.
<SALUTE>&startq;Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;Though I have every rea&s;on to
wi&s;h the melancholy event which
brought me here, might continue un|known;
yet your generous concern
for a &s;tranger, who had no recom|mendation
to your notice but her ap|pearing
unhappy, and who&s;e &s;u&s;pi|cious
&s;ituation would have injured her
<PB N="96" REF="98">
in a mind le&s;s noble than yours, has
determined me to lay before you a
&s;tory, which it was my re&s;olution to
conceal for ever.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;aw, Madam, in your counte|nance,
when you honored me by
calling at my hou&s;e this morning, and
I &s;aw with an admiration no words
can &s;peak, the amiable &s;truggle be|tween
the de&s;ire of knowing the na|ture
of my di&s;tre&s;s in order to &s;often
it, and the delicacy which forbad your
enquiries, le&s;t they &s;hould wound my
&s;en&s;ibility and &s;elf-love.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To &s;uch a heart I run no hazard in
relating what in the world would, per|haps,
draw on me a thou&s;and reproaches;
reproaches, however, I &s;latter my&s;elf,
unde&s;erved.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have had the politene&s;s to &s;ay,
there is &s;omething in my appearance
which &s;peaks my birth above my pre|&s;ent
<PB N="97" REF="99">
&s;ituation: in this, Madam, I am
&s;o happy as not to deceive your gene|rous
partiality.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My father, who was an officer of
family and merit, had the misfortune
to lo&s;e my mother whil&s;t I was an in|fant.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He had the goodne&s;s to take on
him&s;elf the care of directing my edu|cation,
and to have me taught what|ever
he thought becoming my &s;ex,
though at an expence much too great
for his income.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As he had little more than his com|mi&s;&s;ion,
his parental tenderne&s;s got &s;o
far the better of his love for his pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
that, when I was about fifteen,
he determined on quitting the army, in
order to provide better for me; but,
whil&s;t he was in treaty for this purpo&s;e,
a fever carried him off in a few days,
and left me to the world, with little
<PB N="98" REF="100">
more than five hundred pounds, which,
however, was, by his will, immediately
in my power.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I felt too &s;trongly the lo&s;s of this
excellent parent to attend to any
other con&s;ideration; and, before I was
enough my&s;elf to think what I was
to do for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, a friend of
my own age, whom I tenderly loved,
who was ju&s;t returning from &s;chool
to her father's, in the north of Eng|land,
in&s;i&s;ted on my accompanying her,
and &s;pending &s;ome time with her in the
country.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I found in my dear Sophia, all the
con&s;olation my grief could receive;
and, at her pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitation, and
that of her father, who &s;aw his daugh|ter's
happine&s;s depended on having me
with her, I continued there three
years, ble&s;t in the calm delights of
friend&s;hip, and tho&s;e blamele&s;s plea|&s;ures,
with which we &s;hould be too
<PB N="99" REF="101">
happy, if the heart could content it&s;elf,
when a young baronet, who&s;e form
was as lovely as his &s;oul was dark, came
to interrupt our felicity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My Sophia, at a ball, had the mi&s;|fortune
to attract his notice; &s;he was
rather hand&s;ome, though without re|gular
features; her form was elegant
and feminine, and &s;he had an air of
youth, of &s;oftne&s;s, of &s;en&s;ibility, of
blu&s;hing innocence, which &s;eemed in|tended
to in&s;pire delicate pa&s;&s;ions alone,
and which would have di&s;armed any
mind le&s;s depraved than that of the
man, who only admired to de&s;troy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She was the ro&s;e-bud yet impervious
to the &s;un.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Her heart was tender, but had never
met an object which &s;eemed worthy of
it; her &s;entiments were di&s;intere&s;ted,
and romantic to exce&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="102">
&startq;Her father was, at that time, in
Holland, whither the death of a re|lation,
who had left him a &s;mall
e&s;tate, had called him: we were alone,
unprotected, delivered up to the un|happy
inexperience of youth, mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
of our own conduct; my&s;elf, the
elde&s;t of the two, but ju&s;t eighteen,
when my Sophia's ill fate conducted
Sir Charles Verville to the ball where
&s;he fir&s;t &s;aw him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He danced with her, and endeavored
to recommend him&s;elf by all tho&s;e
little unmeaning, but flattering atten|tions,
by which our credulous &s;ex are
&s;o often mi&s;led; his manner was ten|der,
yet timid, mode&s;t, re&s;pectful; his
eyes were continually fixed on her, but
when he met hers, artfully ca&s;t down,
as if afraid of offending.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to enquire after
her health the next day; he came, he
was enchanting, polite, lively, &s;oft,
<PB N="101" REF="103">
in&s;inuating, adorned with every out|ward
grace which could embelli&s;h
virtue, or hide vice from view; to
&s;ee and to love him was almo&s;t the
&s;ame thing.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He entreated leave to continue his
vi&s;its, which he found no difficulty in
obtaining: during two months, not a
day pa&s;&s;ed without our &s;eeing him; his
behaviour was &s;uch as would &s;carce
have alarmed the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious heart;
what then could be expected of us,
young, &s;incere, totally ignorant of the
world, and &s;trongly prejudiced in fa|vor
of a man, who&s;e conver&s;ation &s;poke
his &s;oul the abode of every virtue?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Blu&s;hing I mu&s;t own, nothing but
the apparent preference he gave to my
lovely friend, could have &s;aved my
heart from being a prey to the &s;ame
tenderne&s;s which ruined her.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104">
&startq;He addre&s;&s;ed her with all the &s;pe|cious
arts which vice could invent to
&s;educe innocence; his re&s;pect, his
e&s;teem, &s;eemed equal to his pa&s;&s;ion;
he talked of honor, of the delight of
an union where the tender affections
alone were con&s;ulted; wi&s;hed for her
father's return, to a&s;k her of him in
marriage; pretended to count impa|tiently
the hours of his ab&s;ence, which
delayed his happine&s;s: he even pre|vailed
on her to write her father an ac|count
of his addre&s;&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;New to love, my Sophia's young
heart too ea&s;ily gave way to the &s;oft im|pre&s;&s;ion;
&s;he loved, &s;he idolized this
mo&s;t ba&s;e of mankind; &s;he would have
thought it a kind of &s;acrilege to have
had any will in oppo&s;ition to his.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;After &s;ome months of unremitted
a&s;&s;iduity, her father being expected in
a few days, he dropped a hint, as if by
<PB N="103" REF="105">
accident, that he wi&s;hed his fortune le&s;s,
that he might be the more certain he was
loved for him&s;elf alone; he blamed him|&s;elf
for this delicacy, but charged it on
exce&s;s of love; vowed he would rather
die than injure her, yet wi&s;hed to be
convinced her fondne&s;s was without re|&s;erve.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Generous, di&s;intere&s;ted, eager to
prove the exce&s;s and &s;incerity of her
pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he fell into the &s;nare; &s;he
agreed to go off with him, and
live &s;ome time in a retirement where
&s;he was to &s;ee only him&s;elf, after
which he engaged to marry her pub|licly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He pretended ec&s;ta&s;ies at this proof
of affection, yet he&s;itated to accept
it; and, by piquing the genero&s;ity
of her &s;oul, which knew no guile,
and therefore &s;u&s;pected none, led her
to in&s;i&s;t on devoting her&s;elf to wretch
edne&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106">
&startq;In order, however, that this &s;tep
might be as little known as po&s;&s;ible,
as he pretended the utmo&s;t concern
for that honor he was contriving
to de&s;troy, it was agreed between
them, that he &s;hould go immediately
to London, and that &s;he &s;hould fol|low
him, under pretence of a vi&s;it to
a relation at &s;ome di&s;tance; the great|e&s;t
difficulty was, how to hide this
de&s;ign from me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She had never before concealed
a thought from her beloved Fanny;
nor could he now have prevailed
on her to deceive me, had he not
artfully per&s;waded her I was my&s;elf
in love with him; and that, there|fore,
it would be cruel, as well as
imprudent, to tru&s;t me with the
&s;ecret.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing &s;hews &s;o &s;trongly the power
of love, in ab&s;orbing every faculty of
the &s;oul, as my dear Sophia's being
<PB N="105" REF="107">
prevailed on to u&s;e art with the friend
mo&s;t dear to her on earth.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;By an unworthy piece of deceit,
I was &s;ent to a relation for &s;ome
weeks; and the next day Sophia
followed her infamous lover, leaving
letters for me and her father, calcu|lated
to per&s;wade us, they were pri|vately
married.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My di&s;tre&s;s, and that of the un|happy
parent, may more ea&s;ily be
conceived than de&s;cribed; &s;evere by
nature, he ca&s;t her from his heart
and fortune for ever, and &s;ettled his
e&s;tate on a nephew, then at the uni|ver&s;ity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to me, grief and tenderne&s;s
were the only &s;en&s;ations I felt: I
went to town, and took every pri|vate
method to di&s;cover her retreat,
but in vain; till near a year after,
when, being in London, with a friend
<PB N="106" REF="108">
of my mother's, a &s;ervant, who had
lived with my Sophia, &s;aw me in the
&s;treet, and knew me: by her means,
I di&s;covered that &s;he was in di&s;tre&s;s,
abandoned by her lover, in that mo|ment
when his tenderne&s;s was mo&s;t
nece&s;&s;ary.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I flew to her, and found her in
a mi&s;erable apartment, in which no|thing
but an extreme neatne&s;s would
have made me &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had ever
&s;een happier days: the &s;ervant who
brought me to her attended her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She was in bed, pale, emaciated;
the lovely babe you &s;aw with me in
her arms.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Though prepared for my vi&s;it, &s;he
was unable to bear the &s;hock of
&s;eeing me; I ran to her, &s;he rai&s;ed
her&s;elf in the bed, and, throw|ing
her &s;eeble arms round my
neck, could only &s;ay,&endq; &startq;My Fanny!
<PB N="107" REF="109">
is this po&s;&s;ible!&endq; &startq;and fainted a|way.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Our cares having recovered her,
&s;he endeavored to compo&s;e her&s;elf;
her eyes were fixed tenderly on me,
&s;he pre&s;&s;ed my hand between hers,
the tears &s;tole &s;ilently down her cheeks;
&s;he looked at her child, then at me;
&s;he would have &s;poke, but the feel|ings
of her heart were too &s;trong for
expre&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I begged her to be calm, and promi&s;|ed
to &s;pend the day with her; I did
not yet dare, le&s;t the emotion &s;hould
be too much for her weak &s;tate, to tell
her we would part no more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I took a room in the hou&s;e, and de|termined
to give all my attention to
the re&s;toration of her health; after
which, I hoped to contrive to make
my little fortune, with indu&s;try, &s;up|port
us both.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110">
&startq;I &s;at up with her that night;
&s;he got a little re&s;t, &s;he &s;eemed bet|ter
in the morning; &s;he told me
the particulars I have already relat|ed;
&s;he, however, endeavored to &s;of|ten
the cruel behaviour of the wretch,
who&s;e name I could not hear with|out
horror.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She had in the afternoon a little
fever; I &s;ent for a phy&s;ician, he
thought her in danger; what did not
my heart feel from this information?
&s;he grew wor&s;e, I never left her one
moment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The next morning &s;he called me
to her; &s;he took my hand, and look|ing
at me with a tenderne&s;s no lan|guage
can de&s;cribe,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;&startq;My dear, my only friend, &s;aid &s;he,
I am dying; you are come to receive the
la&s;t breath of your unhappy Sophia: I
<PB N="109" REF="111">
wi&s;h with ardor for my father's ble&s;|&s;ing
and forgivene&s;s, but dare not a&s;k
them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The weakne&s;s of my heart has un|done
me; I am lo&s;t, abandoned by
him on whom my &s;oul doated; by
him, for whom I would have &s;acrificed
a thou&s;and lives; he has left me with
my babe to peri&s;h, yet I &s;till love
him with unabated fondne&s;s: the
pang of lo&s;ing him &s;inks me to the
grave!&endq;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Her &s;peech here failed her for a time;
but recovering, &s;he proceeded,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;&startq;Hard as this reque&s;t may &s;eem, and
to whatever mi&s;eries it may expo&s;e my
angel friend, I adjure you not to de&s;ert
my child; &s;ave him from the wretch|edne&s;s
that threatens him; let him find
in you a mother not le&s;s tender, but
more virtuous, than his own.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112">
&startq;I know, my Fanny, I undo you by
this cruel confidence; but who el&s;e
will have mercy on this innocent?&endq;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Unable to an&s;wer, my heart torn
with unutterable angui&s;h, I &s;natched
the lovely babe to my bo&s;om, I
ki&s;&s;ed him, I bathed him with my
tears.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She under&s;tood me, a gleam of
plea&s;ure brightened her dying eyes,
the child was &s;till pre&s;&s;ed to my heart,
&s;he gazed on us both with a look of
wild affection; then, cla&s;ping her
hands together, and breathing a fer|vent
prayer to Heaven, &s;unk down,
and expired without a groan&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To you, Madam, I need not &s;ay
the re&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The eloquence of angels could not
paint my di&s;tre&s;s; I &s;aw the friend of
<PB N="111" REF="113">
my &s;oul, the be&s;t and mo&s;t gentle of
her &s;ex, a breathle&s;s cor&s;e before me;
her heart broke by the ingratitude of
the man &s;he loved, her honor the &s;port
of fools, her guiltle&s;s child a &s;harer in
her &s;hame.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And all this ruin brought on by a
&s;en&s;ibility of which the be&s;t minds alone
are &s;u&s;ceptible, by that noble integrity
of &s;oul which made it impo&s;&s;ible for her
to &s;u&s;pect another.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Di&s;tracted with grief, I ki&s;&s;ed my
Sophia's pale lips, talked to her lifele&s;s
form; I promi&s;ed to protect the &s;weet
babe, who &s;miled on me, and with his
little hand pre&s;&s;ed mine, as if &s;en&s;ible of
what I &s;aid.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As &s;oon as my grief was enough
calmed to render me capable of any
thing, I wrote an account of So|phia's
death to her father, who had
<PB N="112" REF="114">
the inhumanity to refu&s;e to &s;ee her
child.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I di&s;dained an application to her
murderer; and retiring to this place,
where I was, and re&s;olved to conti|nue,
unknown, determined to devote
my life to the &s;weet infant, and to
&s;upport him by an indu&s;try which
I did not doubt Heaven would
pro&s;per.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The faithful girl who had attended
Sophia, begged to continue with me;
we work for the milleners in the neigh|bouring
towns, and, with the little pit|tance
I have, keep above want.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know the con&s;equence of what I
have undertaken; I know I give up
the world and all hopes of happine&s;s
to my&s;elf: yet will I not de&s;ert this
friendle&s;s little innocent, nor betray
the confidence of my expiring friend,
<PB N="113" REF="115">
who&s;e la&s;t moments were &s;oothed with
the hope of his finding a parent's care
in me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have had the goodne&s;s to
wi&s;h to &s;erve me. Sir Charles Ver|ville
is dead: a fever, the con&s;equence
of his ungoverned intemperance, car|ried

William has a worthy character; if
Colonel Rivers, by his general acquaint|ance
with the great world, can repre|&s;ent
this &s;tory to him, it po&s;&s;ibly may
procure my little Charles happier pro&s;|pects
than my poverty can give him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your goodne&s;s, Madam, makes it un|nece&s;&s;ary
to be more explicit: to be un|happy,
and not to have merited it, is a
&s;ufficient claim to your protection.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are above the low prejudices of
common minds; you will pity the
wretched victim of her own un&s;u&s;pect|ing
heart, you will abhor the memory

<P>Thank Heaven! we meet with few

&s;uch a degree of &s;avage in&s;en&s;ibility is
unnatural.</P>
<P>The human heart is created weak, not
wicked: avid of plea&s;ure and of gain;
but with a mixture of benevolence, which
prevents our &s;eeking either to the de&s;truction

Nothing can be more fal&s;e than that we

<P>I AM very impatient, my dear friend,
till you hear from Sir William, though
I have no doubt of his acting as he ought:
our cottagers &s;hall not leave us till their
fate is determined; I have not told Mi&s;s
Williams the &s;tep I have taken.</P>
<P>Emily is more and more plea&s;ed with
this amiable girl: I wi&s;h extremely to be
able to keep her here; as an agreeable
companion of her own age and &s;ex, who&s;e
ideas are &s;imilar, and who, from being in
the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of life, &s;ees things in the
&s;ame point of view, is all that is wanting
to Emily's happine&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to mention &s;imilarity of
ideas, without ob&s;erving how exactly ours
coincide; in all my acquaintance with
<PB N="122" REF="124">
mankind, I never yet met a mind &s;o near|ly
re&s;embling my own; a tie of affection
much &s;tronger than all your merit would
be without that &s;imilarity.</P>
<P>I agree with you, that mankind are
born virtuous, and that it is education and
example which make them otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The believing other men knaves is not
only the way to make them &s;o, but is al&s;o
an infallible method of becoming &s;uch
our&s;elves.</P>
<P>A fal&s;e and ill-judged method of in&s;truc|tion,
by which we imbibe prejudices in&s;tead
of truths, makes us regard the human race
as bea&s;ts of prey; not as brothers, united
by one common bond, and promoting the
general intere&s;t by pur&s;uing our own par|ticular
one.</P>
<P>There is nothing of which I am more
convinced than that,</P>
<Q><PB N="123" REF="125">
&startq;True &s;elf-love and &s;ocial are the
&s;ame:&endq;</Q>
<P>That tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which make the
happine&s;s of individuals, tend directly to
the general good of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The beneficent Author of nature has
made public and private happine&s;s the

<P>'Tis with pain I &s;ay, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of

been to counter-work this wi&s;e order of
Providence, which has ordained, that we
&s;hall make others happy in being &s;o our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>This is in nothing &s;o glaring as in the
point on which not only the happine&s;s,

the re&s;traints on which, in almo&s;t every

celibacy, and a de&s;tructive libertini&s;m
the con&s;equence of it, to give fre&s;h
&s;trength to dome&s;tic tyranny, and &s;ub|ject
the generous affections of uncor|rupted
youth to the guidance of tho&s;e
in whom every motive to action but
avarice is dead; to condemn the blame|le&s;s
victims of duty to a life of indif|ference,
of di&s;gu&s;t, and po&s;&s;ibly of guilt;
but, by oppo&s;ing the very &s;pirit of our
con&s;titution, throwing property into a
few hands, and favoring that exce&s;&s;ive
inequality, which renders one part of
the &s;pecies wretched, without adding to
the happine&s;s of the other; to de&s;troy
at once the dome&s;tic felicity of indivi|duals,
contradict the will of the Su|preme
Being, as clearly wrote in the
book of nature, and &s;ap the very foun|dations
of the mo&s;t perfect form of

<P>But to proceed. The only equality to
which parents in general attend, is that of
fortune; whereas a re&s;emblance in age, in
temper, in per&s;onal attractions, in birth,
in education, under&s;tanding, and &s;enti|ment,
are the only foundations of that
lively ta&s;te, that tender friend&s;hip, with|out
which no union de&s;erves the &s;acred

<P>Timid, compliant youth may be forced

may invite a citizen's daughter he de&s;pi&s;es
to his bed, to repair a &s;hattered fortune;

<P>YOU wrong me exce&s;&s;ively, my dear
Rivers, in accu&s;ing me of a natural
levity in love and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>As to the latter, my frequent changes,
which I freely acknowledge, have not
been owing to any incon&s;tancy, but to
precipitation and want of caution in con|tracting
them.</P>
<P>My general fault has been the folly of
choo&s;ing my friends for &s;ome &s;triking and
agreeable accompli&s;hment, in&s;tead of giv|ing

My incon&s;tancy in love has been meerly
from vanity.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o flattering in the

great firmne&s;s of mind to re&s;i&s;t that kind

de&s;tructive to real happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I blu&s;h to &s;ay, that when I fir&s;t mar|ried

<P>I am now perfectly &s;afe; my vanity has
taken another turn: I pique my&s;elf on
keeping the heart of the lovelie&s;t woman
that ever exi&s;ted, as a nobler conque&s;t

your example, and &s;ociety; and the very

<P>I HAVE this moment a letter from
Temple which has &s;et my heart at re&s;t:
he writes like a lover, yet owns his pa&s;t
danger, with a frankne&s;s which &s;peaks
more &s;trongly than any profe&s;&s;ions could
do, the real pre&s;ent &s;tate of his heart.</P>
<P>My anxiety for my &s;i&s;ter has a little
broke in on my own happine&s;s; in Eng|land,
where the married women are in
general the mo&s;t virtuous in the world, it
is of infinite con&s;equence they &s;hould love
their hu&s;bands, and be beloved by them;
in countries where gallantry is more per|mitted,
it is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="135">
Temple will make her happy whil&s;t &s;he
pre&s;erves his heart; but, if &s;he lo&s;es it,
every thing is to be feared from the viva|city
of his nature, which can never &s;upport
one moment a life of indifference.</P>
<P>He has that warmth of temper which
is the natural &s;oil of the virtues; but
which is unhappily, at the &s;ame time,
mo&s;t apt to produce indi&s;cretions.</P>
<P>Tame, cold, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate minds re|&s;emble
barren lands; warm, animated
ones, rich ground, which, if properly
cultivated, yields the noble&s;t fruit; but,
if neglected, from its luxuriance is mo&s;t
productive of weeds.</P>
<P>His misfortune has been lo&s;ing both
his parents when almo&s;t an infant; and
having been ma&s;ter of him&s;elf and a noble
fortune, at an age when the pa&s;&s;ions hurry
us beyond the bounds of rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">
I am the only per&s;on on earth by whom
he would ever bear to be controlled in
any thing; happily for Lucy, I pre&s;erve
the influence over him which friend&s;hip
fir&s;t gave me.</P>
<P>That influence, and her extreme atten|tion
to &s;tudy his ta&s;te in every thing;
with tho&s;e uncommon graces both of mind
and per&s;on &s;he has received from nature,
will, I hope, effectually fix this wander|ing
&s;tar.</P>
<P>She tells me, &s;he has a&s;ked you to a
ma&s;querade at Temple-hou&s;e, to which you
will extremely oblige us all by coming.</P>
<P>You do not tell us, whether the affair

<P>SIR William Verville is come back to
town; I was with him this morning;
he de&s;ires to &s;ee the child; he tells me, his
brother, in his la&s;t moments, mentioned
this &s;tory in all the agony of remor&s;e, and
begged him to provide for the little inno|cent,

many enquiries, but hitherto in vain; and
that he thought him&s;elf happy in the di&s;|covery.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138">

<P>YES, my dear Bell, politene&s;s is un|doubtedly
a moral virtue.</P>
<P>As we are beings formed for, and not
capable of being happy without, &s;ociety,
it is the duty of every one to endeavor to
make it as ea&s;y and agreeable as they can;
which is only to be done by &s;uch an
attention to others as is con&s;i&s;tent with
what we owe to our&s;elves; all we give
them in civility will be re-paid us in
re&s;pect: in&s;olence and ill-breeding are
dete&s;table to all mankind.</P>
<P>I long to &s;ee you, my dear Bell; the
delight I have had in your &s;ociety has
<PB N="138" REF="140">
&s;poiled my reli&s;h for that of meer acquain|tance,
however agreeable.</P>
<P>'Tis dangerous to indulge in the
plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip; they weaken
one's ta&s;te too much for common con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Yet what other plea&s;ures are worth
the name? what others have &s;pirit and
delicacy too?</P>
<P>I am preparing for the ma&s;querade,
which is to be the 18th; I am ex|tremely
di&s;appointed you will not be
with us.</P>
<P>My dre&s;s is &s;imple and unornament|ed,
but I think becoming and prettily
fancied; it is that of a French <HI>pai&s;anne:</HI>
Lucy is to be a &s;ultana, blazing with
diamonds: my mother a Roman ma|tron.</P>
<P>I choo&s;e this dre&s;s becau&s;e I have heard

<P>CERTAINLY, my dear, friend&s;hip
is a mighty pretty invention, and,
next to love, gives of all things the
greate&s;t &s;pirit to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>And yet the prudery of the age will
hardly allow us poor women even this
plea&s;ure, innocent as it is.</P>
<P>I remember my aunt Cecily, who died
at &s;ixty-&s;ix, without ever having felt the
lea&s;t &s;park of affection for any human be|ing,
u&s;ed to tell me, a prudent mode&s;t wo|man
never loved any thing but her&s;elf.</P>
<P>For my part, I think all the kind pro|pen&s;ities
of the heart ought rather to be
<PB N="141" REF="143">
cheri&s;hed than checked; that one is al|lowed
to e&s;teem merit even in the naughty
creature, man.</P>
<P>I love you very &s;incerely, Emily: but
I like friend&s;hips for the men be&s;t; and
think prudery, by forbidding them, robs
us of &s;ome of the mo&s;t lively as well as
innocent plea&s;ures of the heart.</P>
<P>That de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, which one feels
much the mo&s;t &s;trongly for a <HI>male</HI> friend,
is in it&s;elf a very agreeable emotion.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, I am a coquet even in
friend&s;hip; and I am not quite &s;ure you
are not in the right.</P>
<P>I am extremely in love with my hu&s;|band;
yet choo&s;e other men &s;hould re|gard
me with complacency, am as fond
of attracting the attention of the dear
creatures as ever, and, though I do ju&s;|tice
to your wit, under&s;tanding, &s;enti|ment,
<PB N="142" REF="144">
and all that, prefer Rivers's conver|&s;ation
infinitely to yours.</P>
<P>Women cannot &s;ay civil things to each
other; and if they could, they would
be &s;omething in&s;ipid; whereas a male
friend&mdash;</P>
<P>'Tis ab&s;olutely another thing, my
dear; and the fir&s;t &s;y&s;tem of ethics I
write, I will have a hundred pages on the
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, my dear, I have not the lea&s;t
objection to your having a friend&s;hip for
Fitzgerald. I am the be&s;t-natured crea|ture
in the world, and the fonde&s;t of in|crea&s;ing
the circle of my hu&s;band's inno|cent
amu&s;ements.</P>
<P><HI>A propos</HI> to innocent amu&s;ements, I think
your fair &s;i&s;ter-in-law an exqui&s;ite politi|cian;
calling the plea&s;ures to Temple at
home, is the be&s;t method in the world to
<PB N="143" REF="145">
prevent his going abroad in pur&s;uit of
them.</P>
<P>I am mortified I cannot be at your
ma&s;querade; it is my pa&s;&s;ion, and I have
the prettie&s;t dre&s;s in the world by me.
I am half inclined to elope for a day or

<P>PLEASE to inform the little Bell, I
won't allow her to &s;poil my Emily.</P>
<P>I enter a caveat again&s;t male friend|&s;hips,
which are only fit for ladies of the

<P><PB N="144" REF="146">
I de&s;ire to engro&s;s all Emily's <HI>kind

the lea&s;t &s;hare in her heart, or, if
you plea&s;e in her <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> to an arch-angel.</P>
<P>However, not to be too &s;evere, &s;ince
prudery expects women to have no pro|pen&s;ities
at all, I allow &s;ingle ladies, of all
ranks, &s;izes, ages, and complexions, to
&s;pread the veil of friend&s;hip between their
hearts and the world.</P>
<P>'Tis the fine&s;t day I ever &s;aw, though
the middle of November; a dry &s;oft we&s;t
wind, the air as mild as in April, and an
almo&s;t Canadian &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P>I have been bathing in the clear &s;tream,
at the end of my garden; the &s;ame &s;tream
in which I laved my carele&s;s bo&s;om at thir|teen;
an idea which gave me inconceivable
delight; and the more, as my bo&s;om is as
<PB N="145" REF="147">
gay and tranquil at this moment as in
tho&s;e dear hours of chearfulne&s;s and in|nocence.</P>
<P>Of all local prejudices, that is the

attaches us to the place of our birth.</P>
<P>Sweet home! only &s;eat of true and ge|nuine
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I am extremely in the humor to write
a poem to the hou&s;hold gods.</P>
<P>We neglect the&s;e amiable deities, but
they are revenged; true plea&s;ure is only
to be found under their au&s;pices.</P>
<P>I know not how it is, my dear Fitzge|rald;
but I don't find my pa&s;&s;ion for the
country abate.</P>
<P>I &s;till find the &s;cenes around me lovely;
though, from the change of &s;ea&s;on, le&s;s
&s;miling than when I fir&s;t fixed at Bell|field;
<PB N="146" REF="148">
we have rural bu&s;ine&s;s enough to
amu&s;e, not embarra&s;s us; we have a
&s;mall but excellent library of books, given
us by my mother; &s;he and Emily are two
of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing companions on earth;
the neighbourhood is full of agreeable
people, and, what &s;hould always be at|tended
to in fixing in the country, of for|tunes
not &s;uperior to our own.</P>
<P>The evenings grow long, but they are
only the more jovial; I love the plea|&s;ures
of the table, not for their own
&s;akes, for no man is more indifferent on
this &s;ubject; but becau&s;e they promote
&s;ocial, convivial joy, and bring people
together in good humor with them&s;elves
and each other.</P>
<P>My Emily's &s;uppers are enchanting;
but our little income obliges us to have
few: if I was rich, this would be my
principal extravagance.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="149">
To fill up my mea&s;ure of content,
Emily is plea&s;ed with my retirement,
and finds all her happine&s;s in my af|fection.</P>
<P>We are &s;o little alone, that I find

<HEAD>LETTER CCXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Colonel RIVERS.
<DATE>Nov. 14:</DATE></OPENER>
<P>SO you di&s;approve male friend&s;hips, my
&s;weet Colonel! I thought you had
better ideas of things in general.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald and I have been di&s;puting
on French and Engli&s;h manners, in regard
to gallantry.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="151">
The great que&s;tion is, Whether a man
is more hurt by the imprudent conduct of
his daughter or his wife?</P>
<P>Much may be &s;aid on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome hazard in &s;uffering co|quetry
in either; both contribute to give
charms to conver&s;ation, and introduce
ea&s;e and politene&s;s into &s;ociety; but both
are dangerous to manners.</P>
<P>Our cu&s;toms, however, are mo&s;t likely
to produce good effects, as they give
opportunity for love marriages, the
only ones which can make worthy minds
happy.</P>
<P>The coquetry of &s;ingle women has a
point of view con&s;i&s;tent with honor; that
of married women has generally no point
of view at all; it is, however, of u&s;e <HI>pour
pa&s;&s;er le tems.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152">
As to real gallantry, the French &s;tyle
depraves the minds of men lea&s;t, ours is
mo&s;t favorable to the peace of families.</P>
<P>I think I pre&s;erve the balance of argu|ment
admirably.</P>
<P>My opinion, however, is, that if people
married from affection, there would be no
&s;uch thing as gallantry at all.</P>
<P>Pride, and the parade of life, de&s;troy
all happine&s;s: our whole felicity depends
on our choice in marriage, yet we choo&s;e
from motives more trifling than would
determine us in the common affairs of life.</P>
<P>I knew a gentleman who fancied him&s;elf
in love, yet delayed marrying his mi&s;tre&s;s
till he could afford a &s;et of plate.</P>
<P>Modern manners are very unfavorable
to the tender affections.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="153">
Ancient lovers had only dragons to
combat; ours have the wor&s;e mon&s;ters of
avarice and ambition.</P>
<P>All I &s;hall &s;ay further on the &s;ub|ject
is, that the two happie&s;t people
I ever knew were a country clergy|man
and his wife, who&s;e whole in|come
did not exceed one hundred pounds
a year.</P>
<P>A pretty philo&s;ophical, &s;entimental,
dull kind of an epi&s;tle this!</P>
<P>But you de&s;erve it, for not an&s;wering
my la&s;t, which was divine.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed with Emily's ideas about
her dre&s;s at the ma&s;querade; it is a proof
you are &s;till lovers.</P>
<P>I remember, the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms I di&s;co|vered
of my <HI>tendre&s;&s;e</HI> for Fitzgerald was
my exce&s;&s;ive attention to this article: I
<PB N="152" REF="154">
have tried on twenty different caps when
I expected him at Silleri.</P>
<P>Before we drop the &s;ubject of gallan|tries,
I mu&s;t tell you I am charmed with
you and my <HI>&s;po&s;o,</HI> for never giving the
lea&s;t hint before Emily and me that you
have had any; it is a piece of delicacy
which convinces me of your tenderne&s;s
more than all the vows that ever lovers
broke would do.</P>
<P>I have been hurt at the contrary beha|viour
in Temple; and have ob&s;erved
Lucy to be &s;o too, though her exce&s;&s;ive
attention not to give him pain prevented
her &s;hewing it: I have on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion
&s;een a &s;mile on her countenance,
and a tear of tender regret &s;tarting into
her eyes.</P>
<P>A woman who has vanity without affec|tion
will be plea&s;ed to hear of your pa&s;t
conque&s;ts, and regard them as victims im|molated
<PB N="153" REF="155">
to her &s;uperior charms: to her,
therefore, it is right to talk of them;
but to flatter the <HI>heart,</HI> and give delight
to a woman who truly loves, you &s;hould
appear too much taken up with the pre|&s;ent
pa&s;&s;ion to look back to the pa&s;t: you
&s;hould not even pre&s;ent to her imagination
the thought that you have had other en|gagements:
we know &s;uch things are,
but had rather the idea &s;hould not be
awakened: I may be wrong, but I &s;peak
from my own feelings.</P>
<P>I am exce&s;&s;ively plea&s;ed with a thought
I met with in a little French novel:</P>
<P>&startq;Un homme qui ne peut plus compter
&s;es bonnes fortunes, e&s;t de tous, celui
qui conno&icirc;t le moins les <HI>faveurs.</HI> C'e&s;t

le coeur qu'un homme &agrave; la mode inte|re&s;&s;e.
Plus on e&s;t <HI>pr&ocirc;n&eacute;</HI> par les femmes,
plus il e&s;t facile de les avoir, mais moins
il e&s;t po&s;&s;ible de les enflammer.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156">
To which truth I mo&s;t heartily &s;et my
hand.</P>
<Q>Twelve o'clock.</Q>
<P>I have ju&s;t heard from your &s;i&s;ter, who
tells me, Emily is turned a little natural
philo&s;opher, reads Ray, Derham, and
fifty other &s;trange old fellows that one
never heard of, and is eternally poring
through a micro&s;cope to di&s;cover the won|ders
of creation.</P>
<P>How amazingly learned matrimony
makes young ladies! I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall
have a volume of her di&s;coveries bye
and bye.</P>
<P>She &s;ays too, you have little pets like
&s;weethearts, quarrel and make it up again
in the mo&s;t engaging manner in the
world.</P>
<P>This is ju&s;t what I want to bring Fitz|gerald
to; but the perver&s;e monkey won't
<PB N="155" REF="157">
quarrel with me, do all I can: I am &s;ure
this is not my fault, for I give him rea&s;on
every day of his life.</P>
<P>Shen&s;tone &s;ays admirably, &startq;That re|conciliation
is the tendere&s;t part of love
and friend&s;hip: the &s;oul here di&s;covers
a kind of ela&s;ticity, and, being forced
back, returns with an additional vio|lence.&endq;</P>
<P>Who would not quarrel for the plea|&s;ure
of reconciliation! I &s;hall be very
angry with Fitzgerald if he goes on in
this mild way.</P>
<P>Tell your &s;i&s;ter, &s;he cannot be more

take him to Temple-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He &s;eems to know nothing of my mar|riage
or my &s;i&s;ter's, and I wi&s;h him not
to know of the former till he has &s;een
Emily.</P>
<P>The be&s;t apology I can make for de|clining
his offer, is to &s;hew him the lovely
cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I will contrive they &s;hall conver&s;e toge|ther
at the ma&s;querade, and that he &s;hall
&s;it next her at &s;upper, without their know|ing
any thing of each other.</P>
<P>If he &s;ees her, if he talks with her,
without that prejudice which the know|ledge
of her being the cau&s;e of his di&s;ap|pointment
might give, he cannot fail of
<PB N="159" REF="161">
having for her that admiration which I
never yet met with a mind &s;avage enough
to refu&s;e her.</P>
<P>His daughter has been educated abroad,
which is a circum&s;tance I am plea&s;ed with,
as it gives me the power of refu&s;ing her
without wounding either her vanity, or
her father's, which, had we been acquaint|ed,
might have been piqued at my giving
the preference to another.</P>
<P>She is not in England, but is hourly
expected: the moment &s;he arrives, Lucy
and I will fetch her to Temple-hou&s;e: I
&s;hall be anxious to &s;ee her married to a
man who de&s;erves her. Colonel Willmott
tells me, &s;he is very amiable; at lea&s;t as
he is told, for he has never &s;een her.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h it were po&s;&s;ible to conceal
this offer for ever from Emily; my deli|cacy
is hurt at the idea of her knowing it,
at lea&s;t from me or my family.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="162">
My mother behaves like an angel on
this occa&s;ion; expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf perfectly
happy in my having con&s;ulted my heart
alone in marrying, and &s;peaks of Emi|ly's
tenderne&s;s as a trea&s;ure above all
price.</P>
<P>She does not even hint a wi&s;h to &s;ee me
richer than I am.</P>
<P>Had I never &s;een Emily, I would not
have married this lady unle&s;s love had
united us.</P>
<P>Do not, however, &s;uppo&s;e I have that
romantic contempt for fortune, which is &s;o
pardonable, I had almo&s;t &s;aid &s;o becoming,
at nineteen.</P>
<P>I have &s;een more of the world than
mo&s;t men of my age, and I have &s;een the
advantages of affluence in their &s;tronge&s;t
light.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163">
I think a worthy man not only
may have, but ought to have, an at|tention
to making his way in the world,
and improving his &s;ituation in it, by
every means con&s;i&s;tent with probity and
honor, and with his own real happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I have ever had this attention, and ever
will, but not by ba&s;e means: and, in my
opinion, the very ba&s;e&s;t is that of &s;elling
one's hand in marriage.</P>
<P>With what horror do we regard a man
who is kept! and a man who marries from
intere&s;ted views alone, is kept in the
&s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>He is equally a purcha&s;ed &s;lave, with

<P>The only way to be good, is to retain

<P><PB N="164" REF="166">
As to you, my dear Rivers, with all

<P>Witne&s;s your extreme joy at having

<P>You are a boy, Rivers, I am a girl; and
I hope we &s;hall remain &s;o as long as we

<P>Do you know, my dear friend, that
I am a daughter of the Mu&s;es, and that I
wrote pa&s;torals at &s;even years old?</P>
<P>I am charmed with this, becau&s;e an old
phy&s;ician once told me it was a &s;ymptom,
not only of long life, but of long youth,
which is much better.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="167">
He explained this, by &s;aying &s;ome|thing
about animal &s;pirits, which I do

you may.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been a pretty enough kind

<HEAD>LETTER CCXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Captain FITZGERALD.
<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Nov. 17,</DATE> Morning.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had a letter from Colonel
Willmott my&s;elf to-day; he is &s;till
quite unacquainted with the &s;tate of our
dome&s;tic affairs; &s;uppo&s;es me a batchelor,
and talks of my being his &s;on-in-law as a
certainty, not attending to the probability
of my having other engagements.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169">
His hi&s;tory, which he tells me in this
letter, is a very romantic one. He was a
younger brother, and provided for ac|cordingly:
he loved, when about twenty,
a lady who was as little a favorite of for|tune
as him&s;elf: their families, who on
both &s;ides had other views, joined their
intere&s;t to get him &s;ent to the Ea&s;t In|dies;
and the young lady was removed
to the hou&s;e of a friend in London, where
&s;he was to continue till he had left Eng|land.</P>
<P>Before he went, however, they con|trived
to meet, and were privately mar|ried;
the marriage was known only to
her brother, who was Willmott's friend.</P>
<P>He left her in the care of her brother,
who, under pretence of diverting her me|lancholy,
and endeavoring to cure her
pa&s;&s;ion, obtained leave of his father to take
her with him to France.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="170">
She was there delivered of this child,
and expired a few days after.</P>
<P>Her brother, without letting her fami|ly
know the &s;ecret, educated the infant,
as the daughter of a younger brother
who had been ju&s;t before killed in a
duel in France; her parents, who died
in a few years, were, almo&s;t in their
la&s;t moments, informed of the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
and made a &s;mall provi&s;ion for
the child.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Colonel Willmott,
after experiencing a great variety of mi&s;|fortunes
for many years, during which he
maintained a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with
his brother-in-law, and with no other per|&s;on
in Europe, by a train of lucky acci|dents,
acquired very rapidly a con&s;ider|able
fortune, with which he re&s;olved to re|turn
to England, and marry his daughter to
<PB N="169" REF="171">
me, as the only method to di&s;charge
fully his obligations to my grandfather,
who alone, of all his family, had given
him the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance when he left Eng|land.
He wrote to his daughter, letting
her know his de&s;ign, and directing her to
meet him in London; but &s;he is not yet
arrived.</P>
<P>Six in the Evening.</P>
<P>My mother and Emily went to Temple's
to dinner; they are to dre&s;s there, and I
am to be &s;urprized.</P>
<P>Seven.</P>
<P>Colonel Willmott is come: he is an ex|treme
hand&s;ome man; tall, well-made,
with an air of dignity which one &s;eldom
&s;ees; he is very brown, and, what will
plea&s;e Bell, has an aquiline no&s;e: he
looks about fifty, but is not &s;o much;
change of climate has almo&s;t always the
di&s;agreeable effect of adding &s;ome years to
the look.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="172">
He is dre&s;&s;ing, to accompany me to the

<P><PB N="171" REF="173">
What an entertaining companion have
you lo&s;t, my dear Emily!</P>
<P>He was a little di&s;concerted at &s;eeing
me, and blu&s;hed extremely: but &s;oon re|covered
his amiable, uniform in&s;ipidity of
countenance, and &s;miled and &s;impered as
u&s;ual.</P>
<P>He never enquired after you, nor
even mentioned your name: being a&s;k|ed
for a toa&s;t, I had the malice to give
Rivers; he drank him, without &s;eem|ing
ever to have heard of him be|fore.</P>
<P>The city mi&s;&s;es admire him pro|digiou&s;ly,
and he them; they are charm|ed
with his beauty, and he with their
wit.</P>
<P>His mother, poor woman! could not
bring the match &s;he wrote about to bear:
the family approved him; but the fair one
<PB N="172" REF="174">
made a better choice, and gave her&s;elf la&s;t
week, at St. George's, Hanover-&s;quare, to
a very agreeable fellow of our acquaintance,
Mr. Palmer; a man of &s;en&s;e and honor,
who de&s;erves her had &s;he been ten times
richer: he has a &s;mall e&s;tate in Lincoln|&s;hire,

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you are now the happie&s;t of

beauties in his <HI>belle pai&s;anne,</HI> and you ex|ulting

glorying in your &s;trength.</P>
<P>So the maiden aunts in your neighbour|hood
think Mi&s;s Williams no better than
&s;he &s;hould be?</P>
<P>Either &s;omebody has &s;aid, or the idea
is my own; after all, I believe it Shen|&s;tone's,
That tho&s;e are generally the be&s;t

<PB N="173" REF="175">
injured by &s;landerers, as we u&s;ually find
that the be&s;t fruit which the birds have
been pecking at.</P>
<P>I will, however, allow appearances were
a little again&s;t your cottager; and I would
forgive the good old virgins, if they had
always as &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances to de|termine
from.</P>
<P>But they generally condemn from
trifling indi&s;cretions, and &s;ettle the cha|racters
of their own &s;ex from their con|duct
at a time of life when they are
them&s;elves no judges of its propriety;
they pa&s;s &s;entence on them for &s;mall
errors, when it is an amazing proof
of prudence not to commit great ones.</P>
<P>For my own part, I think tho&s;e who
never have been guilty of any indi&s;cre|tion,
are generally people who have very
little active virtue.</P>

<P>YOUR Emily was happy beyond
words la&s;t night: among&s;t a crowd

followed her; he &s;eemed to &s;ee no other

&s;upper to unma&s;k.</P>
<P>But you will call me a fooli&s;h romantic

delight to &s;ee him plea&s;ed with my dre&s;s,
and charmed with the complai&s;ance which
was &s;hewed me by others.</P>
<P>There was a gentleman who came
with Rivers, who was particularly at|tentive
to me; he is not young, but
<PB N="182" REF="184">
extremely amiable: has a very fine per|&s;on,
with a commanding air; great polite|ne&s;s,
and, as far as one can judge by a
few hours conver&s;ation, an excellent un|der&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I never in my life met with a man for
whom I felt &s;uch a partiality at fir&s;t &s;ight,
except Rivers, who tells me, I have made
a conque&s;t of his friend.</P>
<P>He is to be my cavalier this morning to
Burleigh.</P>
<P>It has this moment &s;truck me, that Ri|vers
never introduced his friend and me
to each other, but as ma&s;ks; I never
thought of this before: I &s;uppo&s;e he
forgot it in the hurry of the ma&s;que|rade.</P>
<P>I do not even know this agreeable
&s;tranger's name; I only found out by his
conver&s;ation he had &s;erved in the army.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="185">
There is no &s;aying how beautiful
Lucy looked la&s;t night; her dre&s;s was
rich, elegantly fancied, and particu|larly
becoming to her graceful form,
which I never &s;aw look &s;o graceful
before.</P>
<P>All who attempted to be fine figures,
&s;hrunk into nothing before her.</P>
<P>Lucy carries her head, you know,
remarkably well; which, with the ad|vantage
of her height, the perfect &s;tand|ard
of women, her fine proportion, the
native dignity of her air, the maje&s;tic
flow of her robe, and the blaze of her
diamonds, gave her a look of infinite
&s;uperiority; a &s;uperiority which &s;ome
of the company &s;eemed to feel in a
manner, which rather, I will own, gave
me pain.</P>
<P>In a place con&s;ecrated to joy, I hate
to &s;ee any thing like an unea&s;y &s;en|&s;ation;
yet, whil&s;t human pa&s;&s;ions are
<PB N="184" REF="186">
what they are, it is difficult to avoid
them.</P>

of the character in which I appeared, pre|vented
compari&s;ons which mu&s;t have been
extremely to my di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>I was &s;afe in my littlene&s;s, like a mo|de&s;t
&s;hrub by the &s;ide of a cedar; and,
being in &s;o different a &s;tyle, had the better
chance to be taken notice of, even where
Lucy was.</P>
<P>She was radiant as the morning &s;tar,
and even dazzlingly lovely.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="187">
Her complexion, for Temple would
not &s;uffer her to wear a ma&s;k at all, had
the vivid glow of youth and health,
heightened by plea&s;ure, and the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
of univer&s;al admiration.</P>
<P>Her eyes had a fire which one could
&s;carce look at.</P>
<P>Temple's vanity and tenderne&s;s were
gratified to the utmo&s;t: he drank eagerly

<P>He is gone to his apartment, whither I

<P>When I announced him to her by that

<P>YOUR friend is the happie&s;t of man|kind.</P>

You may remember, &s;he wi&s;hed to delay

Colonel Willmott's return.</P>
<P>Though promi&s;ed by him to another,
&s;he hoped to bring him to leave her heart

her heart had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Bound by a &s;olemn vow, &s;he concealed

<P>She re&s;olved never to marry another,

<P>She kindly &s;uppo&s;ed he would &s;ee me

change his de&s;ign in my favor: &s;he fan|cied
he would crown her love as the re|ward

<P>My importunity, and the fear of giving

<OPENER>To Mrs. FITZGERALD.
<DATELINE>Temple-hou&s;e, Friday.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY Rivers has told you&mdash;my &s;weet
friend, in what words &s;hall I con|vey
to you an adequate idea of your Emi|ly's
tran&s;port, at a di&s;covery which has
reconciled all her duties!</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="195">
Tho&s;e anxieties, that &s;en&s;e of hav|ing
failed in filial obedience, which ca&s;t
a damp on the joy of being wife to
the mo&s;t beloved of mankind, are at
an end.</P>
<P>This hu&s;band whom I &s;o dreaded,
whom I determined never to accept, was
my Rivers.</P>
<P>My father forgives me; he pardons
the crime of love: he ble&s;&s;es that kind
providence which conducted us to hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>How many has this event made happy!</P>
<P>The mo&s;t amiable of mothers &s;hares
my joy; &s;he bends in grateful thanks to
that indulgent power who has rewarded
her &s;on for all his goodne&s;s to her.</P>
<P>Rivers hears her, and turns away to
hide his tears: her tenderne&s;s melts him
to the &s;oftne&s;s of a woman.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196">
What gratitude do we not owe to hea|ven!
may the &s;en&s;e of it be for ever en|graven
on our hearts!</P>
<P>My Lucy too; all, all are happy.</P>
<P>But I will tell you. Rivers has al|ready
acquainted you with part of my
&s;tory.</P>
<P>My uncle placed me, with a &s;ervant
in whom he could confide, in a convent
in France, till I was &s;even years old; he
then &s;ent for me to England, and left
me at &s;chool eight years longer; after
which, he took me with him to his regi|ment
in Kent, where, you know, our
friend&s;hip began, and continued till he
changed into another, then in America,
whither I attended him.</P>
<P>My father's affairs were, at that time,
in a &s;ituation which determined my uncle
to take the fir&s;t opportunity of marrying
me to advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="197">
I regarded him as a father; he had al|ways
been more than a parent to me; I
had the mo&s;t implicit deference to his
will.</P>
<P>He engaged me to Sir George Clay|ton;
and, when dying, told me the &s;tory
of my birth, to which I had till then
been a &s;tranger, exacting from me, how|ever,
an oath of &s;ecre&s;y till I &s;aw my
father.</P>
<P>He died, leaving me, with a trifle left
in tru&s;t to him for my u&s;e from my grand|father,
about two thou&s;and pounds, which
was all I, at that time, ever expected to
po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>My father was then thought ruined;
there was even a report of his death, and
I imagined my&s;elf ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of my
own actions.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="198">
I was near two years without hear|ing
any thing of him; nor did I
know I had &s;till a father, till the let|ters
you brought me from Mrs. Mel|moth.</P>
<P>A variety of accidents, and our be|ing
both abroad, and in &s;uch di&s;tant
parts of the world, prevented his letters
arriving.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, the kind hand of
Heaven conducted my Rivers to Mont|real.</P>
<P>I &s;aw him; and, from that moment,
my whole &s;oul was his.</P>
<P>Formed for each other, our love was
&s;udden and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s as the bolt of hea|ven:
the fir&s;t glance of tho&s;e dear &s;peak|ing
eyes gave me a new being, and
awaked in me ideas never known be|fore.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="199">
The &s;tronge&s;t &s;ympathy attached me
to him in &s;pite of my&s;elf: I thought
it friend&s;hip, but felt that friend|&s;hip
more lively than what I called
my <HI>love</HI> for Sir George; all conver|&s;ation
but his became in&s;upportable
to me; every moment that he pa&s;&s;ed
from me, I counted as lo&s;t in my ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>I loved him; that tenderne&s;s hourly
increa&s;ed: I hated Sir George, I fan|cied
him changed; I &s;tudied to find
errors in a man who had, a few weeks
before, appeared to me amiable, and
whom I had con&s;ented to marry; I broke
with him, and felt a weight removed
from my &s;oul.</P>
<P>I trembled when Rivers appeared;
I died to tell him my whole &s;oul was
his; I watched his looks, to find there
the &s;ame &s;entiments with which he had
in&s;pired me: that tran&s;porting moment
<PB N="198" REF="200">
at length arrived; I had the delight to
find our tenderne&s;s was mutual, and to
devote my life to making happy the
lord of my de&s;ires.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melmoth's letter brought me my
father's commands, if unmarried, to con|tinue
&s;o till his return.</P>
<P>He added, that he intended me for a re|lation,
to who&s;e family he had obligations;
that, his affairs having &s;uffered &s;uch a
happy revolution, he had it in his power
and, therefore, thought it his duty, to pay
this debt of gratitude; and, at the &s;ame
time hoped to make me happy by con|necting
me with an amiable family, allied
to him by blood and friend&s;hip; and unit|ing
me to a man whom report &s;poke wor|thy
of all my tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>You may remember, my deare&s;t Bell,
how &s;trongly I was affected on reading
tho&s;e letters: I wrote to Rivers, to beg
<PB N="199" REF="201">
him to defer our marriage; but the man|ner
in which he took that reque&s;t, and the
fear of appearing indifferent to him, con|quered
all &s;en&s;e of what I owed to my fa|ther,
and I married him; making it,
however, a condition that he &s;hould a&s;k
no explanation of my conduct till I cho&s;e
to give it.</P>
<P>I knew not the character of my fa|ther;
he might be a tyrant, and divide
us from each other: Rivers doubted
my tenderne&s;s; would not my waiting,
if my father had afterwards refu&s;ed his
con&s;ent to our union, have added to
tho&s;e cruel &s;u&s;picions? might he not
have &s;uppo&s;ed I had cea&s;ed to love
him, and waited for the excu&s;e of pater|nal
authority to ju&s;tify a change of &s;enti|ment?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, love bore down every other
con&s;ideration; if I per&s;i&s;ted in this delay,
I might hazard lo&s;ing all my &s;oul held
<PB N="200" REF="202">
dear, the only object for which life was
worth my care.</P>
<P>I determined, if I married, to give
up all claim to my father's fortune,
which I &s;hould ju&s;tly forfeit by my
di&s;obedience to his commands: I hoped,
however, Rivers's merit, and my fa|ther's
paternal affection, when he knew
us both, would influence him to make
&s;ome provi&s;ion for me as his daughter.</P>
<P>Half his fortune was all I ever hoped
for, or even would have cho&s;e to accept:
the re&s;t I determined to give up to the
man whom I refu&s;ed to marry.</P>
<P>I gave my hand to Rivers, and
was happy; yet the idea of my fa|ther's
return, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
having di&s;obeyed him, ca&s;t &s;ometimes
a damp on my felicity, and threw a
gloom over my &s;oul, which all my en|deavors
could &s;carce hide from Rivers,
<PB N="201" REF="203">
though his delicacy prevented his a&s;king
the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I now know, what was then a &s;ecret to
me, that my father had offered his daugh|ter
to Rivers, with a fortune which could,
however, have been no temptation to a
mind like his, had he not been attached
to me: he declined the offer, and, le&s;t I
&s;hould hear of it, and, from a romantic
di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, want him to accept it,
pre&s;&s;ed our marriage with more importu|nity
than ever; yet had the genero&s;ity to
conceal this &s;acrifice from me, and to wi&s;h
it &s;hould be concealed for ever.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments, &s;o noble, &s;o peculiar
to my Rivers, prevented an explanation,
and hid from us, for &s;ome time, the cir|cum&s;tances
which now make our happi|ne&s;s
&s;o perfect.</P>
<P>How infinitely worthy is Rivers of all
my tenderne&s;s!</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="204">
My father has &s;ent to &s;peak with me in

We knew from the fir&s;t of your fa|ther's

a promi&s;e from us, never on any

al&s;o de&s;ired us to detain you in Berk&s;hire,
by lengthening our vi&s;it, till your mar|riage,
le&s;t any friend of your father's in

<P>Fitzgerald is <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Majeur,</HI> at your

this morning.</P>
<P>I once again congratulate you, my dear,
on this triumph of tenderne&s;s: you &s;ee
love, like virtue, is not only its own re|ward,
but &s;ometimes intitles us to other
rewards too.</P>
<P>It &s;hould always be con&s;idered, that
tho&s;e who marry from love, <HI>may</HI> grow
rich; but tho&s;e who marry to be rich,
will <HI>never</HI> love.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206">
The very idea that love will come after
marriage, is &s;hocking to minds which
have the lea&s;t &s;park of delicacy: to &s;uch
minds, a marriage which begins with in|difference
will certainly end in di&s;gu&s;t and

<P>I be&s;peak your papa for my <HI>ceci&s;beo;</HI>

<P>But I am piqued, my dear. &startq;Senti|ments

Rivers&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>I am apt to believe there are men in the

very <HI>peculiar</HI>&mdash;and that &s;ome people's &s;en|timents
may be as noble as other people's.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I am inclined to fancy Fitzge|rald
would have acted ju&s;t the &s;ame part in

<P>But it is your great fault, my dear Emi|ly,
to &s;uppo&s;e your love a phoenix, where|as

he is only an agreeable, worthy, hand|&s;ome

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you will be very angry; but
who cares? I will be angry too.</P>
<P>Surely, my Fitzgerald&mdash;I allow Rivers
all his merit; but compari&s;ons, my dear&mdash;</P>
<P>Both our fellows, to be &s;ure, are charm|ing
creatures; and I would not change
them for a couple of Adonis's: yet I don't
in&s;i&s;t upon it, that there is nothing agree|able
in the world but them.</P>
<P>You &s;hould remember, my dear, that
beauty is in the lover's eye; and that,
however highly you may think of Rivers,
every woman breathing has the &s;ame idea
of <HI>the dear man.</HI></P>
<P>O heaven! I mu&s;t tell you, becau&s;e it
will flatter your vanity about your charmer.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208">
I have had a letter from an old lover

<P>'Tis a mighty fooli&s;h re&s;olution, and yet

<P>Have no fear of falling into vegetation;

<P><PB N="209" REF="211">
I have a thou&s;and ideas of little amu&s;e|ments,

<P>None of our party are of that &s;leepy

this is the defect of the cold and inani|mate,
who have not &s;pirit and vivacity

<P>Our adventures of one kind are at an

<P>I dare &s;ay, our whole lives will be Pin|daric:
my only plan of life is to have
none at all, which, I think, my little Bell
will approve.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, my &s;weet Bell, to

I mu&s;t teach you to love rural plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Colonel Willmott has made me ju&s;t as
rich as I wi&s;h to be.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know, my fair friend, that
whil&s;t I thought a fortune and Emily in|compatible,
I had infinite contempt for
the former, and fancied that it would ra|ther
take from, than add to, my happi|ne&s;s;
but, now I can po&s;&s;e&s;s it with her,
I allow it all its value.</P>
<P>My father (with what delight do I call
the father of Emily by that name!) hinted
at my taking a larger hou&s;e; but I would
not leave my native Dryads for an impe|rial
palace: I have, however, agreed to
<PB N="211" REF="213">
let him build a wing to Bellfield, which
it wants, to compleat the original plan,
and to furni&s;h it in whatever manner he

we are to ramble from one to the other as
fancy leads us.</P>
<P>He in&s;i&s;ts on our having no rule but in|clination:
do you think we are in any
danger of vegetating, my dear Bell?</P>
<P>The great &s;cience of life is, to keep in
con&s;tant employment that re&s;tle&s;s active
principle within us, which, if not directed
right, will be eternally drawing us from
real to imaginary happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Love, all charming as it is, requires to
be kept alive by &s;uch a variety of amu&s;e|ments,
or avocations, as may prevent the

Emily's tenderne&s;s and delicacy make
me ever an expecting lover: &s;he contrives
little parties of plea&s;ure, and by &s;urprize,
of which &s;he is always the ornament and
the &s;oul: her whole attention is given to
make her Rivers happy.</P>
<P>I envy the man who attends her on the&s;e
little excur&s;ions.</P>
<P>Love with us is ever led by the Sports
and the Smiles.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, people who have the
&s;pirit to act as we have done, to dare to
choo&s;e their own companions for life, will
generally be happy.</P>
<P>The affections are the true &s;ources of
enjoyment: love, friend&s;hip, and, if you
will allow me to anticipate, paternal ten|derne&s;s,
all the dome&s;tic attachments, are
&s;weet beyond words.</P>

<P>You are right, my dear Bell, and I am

<P>I &s;end this by Temple's &s;ervant. On
Thur&s;day I hope to &s;ee our dear groupe of
friends re-united, and to have nothing to
