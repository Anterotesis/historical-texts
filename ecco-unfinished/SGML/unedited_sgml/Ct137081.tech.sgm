DISSERTATION.</HEAD>
<P>NATIONS, &s;mall in their beginnings and &s;low in their progre&s;s
to maturity, cannot, with any degree of certainty, be traced
to their &s;ource. The fir&s;t hi&s;torians, in every country, are, therefore,
ob&s;cure and un&s;atisfactory. Swayed by a national partiality, natural
to mankind, they adopted uncertain legends and ill-fancied fictions,
when they &s;erved to &s;trengthen a favourite &s;y&s;tem, or to throw lu&s;tre on
the antient &s;tate of their country. Without judgment or di&s;cernment
to &s;eparate the probable and more antient traditions, from ill-dige&s;ted
tales of late invention, they jumbled the whole together, in one
ma&s;s of anachroni&s;ms and incon&s;i&s;tencies. Their accounts, how|ever,
though deduced from aeras too remote to be known, were re|ceived
with that partial credulity which always di&s;tingui&s;hes an un|poli&s;hed
age. Mankind had neither abilities nor inclination to di&s;|pute
the truth of relations, which, by throwing lu&s;tre on their an|ce&s;tors,
flattered their own vanity.&mdash;Such were the hi&s;torians of
Europe, during the dark ages, which &s;ucceeded the &s;ubver&s;ion of
the Roman empire. When learning began to revive, men looked
into antiquity with le&s;s prejudiced eyes. They cho&s;e rather to tru&s;t
their national fame to late and well-atte&s;ted tran&s;actions, than draw
it from ages, dark and involved in fable.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4">
THE Romans give the fir&s;t and, indeed, the only authentic ac|counts
of the northern nations. De&s;titute of the u&s;e of letters,
they them&s;elves had no means of tran&s;mitting their hi&s;tory to po|&s;terity.
Their traditions and &s;ongs were lo&s;t, or altogether corrupt|ed,
in their revolutions and migrations, which were &s;o frequent and
univer&s;al, that no kingdom in Europe is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by its origi|nal
inhabitants. Societies were formed, and kingdoms erected,
from a mixture of nations, who, in proce&s;s of time, lo&s;t all know|lege
of their own origin.</P>
<P>IF tradition could be depended upon, it is only among a people,
from all time, free of intermixture with foreigners. We are to
look for the&s;e among the mountains and inacce&s;&s;ible parts of a
country: places, on account of their barrenne&s;s, uninviting to an
enemy, or who&s;e natural &s;trength enabled the natives to repel in|va&s;ions.
Such are the inhabitants of the mountains of Scotland.
We, accordingly, find, that they differ materially from tho&s;e who
po&s;&s;e&s;s the low aud more fertile part of the kingdom. Their lan|guage
is pure and original, and their manners are tho&s;e of an an|tient
and unmixed race of men. Con&s;cious of their own antiquity,
they long de&s;pi&s;ed others, as a new and mixed people. As they
lived in a country only fit for pa&s;ture, they were free of that toil
and bu&s;ine&s;s, which engro&s;s the attention of a commercial people.
Their amu&s;ement con&s;i&s;ted in hearing or repeating their &s;ongs and
traditions, and the&s;e intirely turned on the antiquity of their nation,
and the exploits of their forefathers. It is no wonder, therefore,
that there are more remains of antiquity among them, than among
any other people in Europe. Traditions, however, concerning re|mote
periods, are only to be regarded, in &s;o far as they co-incide
with cotemporary writers of undoubted credit and veracity.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5">
No writers began their accounts from a more early period, than
the hi&s;torians of the Scotch nation. Without records, or even tra|dition
it&s;elf, they give a long li&s;t of antient kings, and a detail of
their tran&s;actions, with a &s;crupulous exactne&s;s. One might natu|rally
&s;uppo&s;e, that, when they had no authentic annals, they
&s;hould, at lea&s;t, have recour&s;e to the traditions of their country,
and have reduced them into a regular &s;y&s;tem of hi&s;tory. Of both
they &s;eem to have been equally de&s;titute. Born in the low country,
and &s;trangers to the antient language of their nation&punc; they content|ed
them&s;elves with copying from one another, and retailing the
&s;ame fictions, in a new colour and dre&s;s.</P>
<P>JOHN FORDUN was the fir&s;t who collected tho&s;e fragments of the
Scotch hi&s;tory, which had e&s;caped the brutal policy of Edward I. and
reduced them into order. His accounts, in &s;o far as they concerned
recent tran&s;actions, de&s;erved credit: beyond a certain period, they
were fabulous and un&s;atisfactory. Some time before Fordun wrote,
the king of England, in a letter to the pope, had run up the antiquity
of his nation to a very remote aera. Fordun, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the national
prejudice of the age, was unwilling that his country &s;hould yield,
in point of antiquity, to a people, then its rivals and enemies.
De&s;titute of annals in Scotland, he had recour&s;e to Ireland, which,
according to the vulgar errors of the times, was reckoned the fir&s;t
habitation of the Scots. He found, there, that the Iri&s;h bards had
carried their preten&s;ions to antiquity as high, if not beyond any
nation in Europe. It was from them he took tho&s;e improbable
fictions, which form the fir&s;t part of his hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>THE writers that &s;ucceeded Fordun implicitly followed his &s;y&s;|tem,
tho' they &s;ometimes varied from him in their relations of par|ticular
tran&s;actions, and the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their kings.
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
As they had no new lights, and were, equally with him, unac|quainted
with the traditions of their country, their hi&s;tories contain
little information concerning the origin of the Scots. Even Bu|chanan
him&s;elf, except the elegance and vigour of his &s;tile, has
very little to recommend him. Blinded with political prejudices,
he &s;eemed more anxious to turn the fictions of his predece&s;&s;ors to
his own purpo&s;es, than to detect their mi&s;repre&s;entations, or inve&s;|tigate
truth amid&s;t the darkne&s;s which they had thrown round it.
It therefore appears, that little can be collected from their own hi&s;|torians,
concerning the fir&s;t migration of the Scots into Britain.</P>
<P>THAT this i&s;land was peopled from Gaul admits of no doubt.
Whether colonies came afterwards from the north of Europe is a
matter of mere &s;peculation. When South-Britain yielded to the
power of the Romans, the unconquered nations to the north of the
province were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Caledonians.</HI> From
their very name, it appears, that they were of tho&s;e <HI>Celts,</HI> or
<HI>Gauls,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves originally of Britain. It is com|pounded
of two <HI>Celtic</HI> words, <HI>Ca&euml;l</HI> &s;ignifying <HI>Celts,</HI> or <HI>Gauls,</HI> and
<HI>Dun</HI> or <HI>Don, a hill;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Ca&euml;l-don,</HI> or Caledonians, is as much
as to &s;ay, the <HI>Celts of the hill country.</HI> The Highlanders, to this
day, call them&s;elves <HI>Ca&euml;l,</HI> and their language <HI>Ca&euml;lic,</HI> or <HI>Galic.</HI>
This, of it&s;elf, is &s;ufficient to demon&s;trate, that they are the ge|nuine
de&s;cendents of the antient Caledonians, and not a pretended
colony of <HI>Scots,</HI> who &s;ettled fir&s;t in the north, in the third or
fourth century.</P>
<P>FROM the double meaning of the word <HI>Ca&euml;l,</HI> which &s;ignifies
<HI>&s;trangers,</HI> as well as <HI>Gauls,</HI> or <HI>Celts,</HI> &s;ome have imagined, that the
ance&s;tors of the Caledonians were of a different race from the re&s;t
<PB N="v" REF="7">
of the Britons, and that they received their name upon that ac|count.
This opinion, &s;ay they, is &s;upported by Tacitus, who,
from &s;everal circum&s;tances, concludes, that the Caledonians were of
German extraction. A di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a point &s;o intricate, at this
di&s;tance of time, could neither be &s;atisfactory nor important.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the latter end of the third, and beginning of the
fourth century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Hierom. ad Cte&s;iphon.</NOTE> we meet with the <HI>Scots</HI> in the north. Porphyrius
makes the fir&s;t mention of them about that time. As the <HI>Scots</HI>
were not heard of before that period, mo&s;t writers &s;uppo&s;ed them
to have been a colony, newly come to Britain, and that the <HI>Picts</HI>
were the only genuine de&s;cendents of the antient Caledonians.
This mi&s;take is ea&s;ily removed. The Caledonians, in proce&s;s of
time, became naturally divided into two di&s;tinct nations, as po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
parts of the country, intirely different in their nature
and &s;oil. The we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland is hilly and barren; to|wards
the ea&s;t the country is plain, and fit for tillage. The inhabi|tants
of the mountains, a roving and uncontrouled race of men,
lived by feeding of cattle, and what they killed in hunting.
Their employment did not fix them to one place. They removed
from one heath to another, as &s;uited be&s;t with their convenience
or inclination. They were not, therefore, improperly called, by
their neighbours, SCUITE, or, <HI>the wandering nation;</HI> which is evi|dently
the origin of the Roman name of <HI>Scoti.</HI></P>
<P>ON the other hand, the Caledonians, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ea&s;t coa&s;t
of Scotland, as their divi&s;ion of the country was plain and fertile,
applied them&s;elves to agriculture, and rai&s;ing of corn. It was
from this, that the Galic name of the <HI>Picts</HI> proceeded; for they
are called, in that language, <HI>Cruithuich,</HI> i. e. <HI>the wheat or corn|eaters.</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
As the Picts lived in a country &s;o different in its nature
from that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Scots, &s;o their national character &s;uffered
a material change. Unob&s;tructed by mountains, or lakes, their
communication with one another was free and frequent. Society,
therefore, became &s;ooner e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, than among the
Scots, and, con&s;equently, they were much &s;ooner governed by civil
magi&s;trates and laws. This, at la&s;t, produced &s;o great a difference
in the manners of the two nations, that they began to forget their
common origin, and almo&s;t continual quarrels and animo&s;ities &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
between them. The&s;e animo&s;ities, after &s;ome ages, ended in
the &s;ubver&s;ion of the Picti&s;h kingdom, but not in the total extirpa|tion
of the nation, according to mo&s;t of the Scotch writers, who
&s;eemed to think it more for the honour of their countrymen to
annihilate, than reduce a rival people under their obedience. It is
certain, however, that the very name of the Picts was lo&s;t, and
tho&s;e that remained were &s;o compleatly incorporated with their
conquerors, that they &s;oon lo&s;t all memory of their own origin.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE end of the Picti&s;h government is placed &s;o near that period,
to which authentic annals reach, that it is matter of wonder, that
we have no monuments of their language or hi&s;tory remaining.
This favours the &s;y&s;tem I have laid down. Had they originally
been of a different race from the Scots, their language of cour&s;e
would be different. The contrary is the ca&s;e. The names of places
in the Picti&s;h dominions, and the very names of their kings, which
are handed down to us, are of Galic original, which is a convincing
proof, that the two nations were, of old, one and the &s;ame, and
only divided into two governments, by the effect which their &s;itua|tion
had upon the genius of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="9">
THE name of <HI>Picts</HI> was, perhaps, given by the Romans to the
Caledonians, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ea&s;t coa&s;t of Scotland, from their
painting their bodies. This circum&s;tance made &s;ome imagine, that
the Picts were of Briti&s;h extract, and a different race of men from the
Scots. That more of the Britons, who fled northward from the tyranny
of the Romans, &s;ettled in the low country of Scotland, than among the
Scots of the mountains, may be ea&s;ily imagined, from the very nature
of the country. It was they who introduced painting among the Picts.
From this circum&s;tance proceeded the name of the latter, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
them from the Scots, who never had that art among them, and
from the Britons, who di&s;continued it after the Roman conque&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Caledonians, mo&s;t certainly, acquired a con&s;iderable know|ledge
in navigation, by their living on a coa&s;t inter&s;ected with ma|ny
arms of the &s;ea, and, in i&s;lands, divided, one from another, by
wide and dangerous firths. It is, therefore, highly probable, that
they, very early, found their way to the north of Ireland, which
is within &s;ight of their own country. That Ireland was fir&s;t
peopled from Britain is certain. The vicinity of the two i&s;lands;
the exact corre&s;pondence of the antient inhabitants of both, in
point of manners and language, are &s;ufficient proofs, even if we
had not the te&s;timony of authors of undoubted veracity to confirm
it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dio. Sic. l. 5.</NOTE> The abettors of the mo&s;t romantic &s;y&s;tems of Iri&s;h antiquities
allow it; but they place the colony from Britain in an improbable
and remote aera. I &s;hall ea&s;ily admit, that the colony of the <HI>Fir|bolg,</HI>
confe&s;&s;edly the <HI>Belgae</HI> of Britain, &s;ettled in the &s;outh of Ire|land,
before the <HI>Ca&euml;l,</HI> or Caledonians, di&s;covered the north: but it
is not at all likely, that the migration of the Firbolg to Ireland
happened many centuries before the incarnation.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="10">
OSSIAN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temora, Book II.</NOTE> in the poem of Temora, throws con&s;iderable light
on this &s;ubject. His accounts agree &s;o well with what the antients
have delivered, concerning the fir&s;t population and inhabitants of
Ireland, that every unbia&s;&s;ed per&s;on will confe&s;s them more probable,
than the legends handed down, by tradition, in that country.
From him, it appears, that, in the days of Trathal, grandfather to
Fingal, Ireland was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by two nations; the <HI>Firbolg</HI> or <HI>Belgae</HI>
of Britain, who inhabited the &s;outh, and the <HI>Ca&euml;l,</HI> who pa&s;&s;ed over
from Caledonia and the Hebrides to Ul&s;ter. The two nations, as
is u&s;ual among an unpoli&s;hed and lately &s;ettled people, were di|vided
into &s;mall dyna&s;ties, &s;ubject to petty kings, or chiefs, inde|pendent
of one another. In this &s;ituation, it is probable, they
continued long, without any material revolution in the &s;tate of the
i&s;land, until Crothar, Lord of Atha, a country in Connaught, the
mo&s;t potent chief of the <HI>Firbolg,</HI> carried away Conlama, the daugh|ter
of Cathmin, a chief of the <HI>Cael,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Ul&s;ter.</P>
<P>CONLAMA had been betrothed, &s;ome time before, to Turloch, a
cheif of her own nation. Turloch re&s;ented the affront offered him by
Crothar, made an irruption into Connaught, and killed Cormul, the
brother of Crothar, who came to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. Crothar
him&s;elf then took arms, and either killed or expelled Turloch.
The war, upon this, became general, between the two nations:
and the Ca&euml;l were reduced to the la&s;t extremity.&mdash;In this &s;ituation,
they applied, for aid, to Trathal king of Morven, who &s;ent his
brother Conar, already famous for his great exploits, to their relief.
Conar, upon his arrival in Ul&s;ter, was cho&s;en king, by the unani|mous
con&s;ent of the Caledonian tribes, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that coun|try.
The war was renewed with vigour and &s;ucce&s;s; but the <HI>Fir|bolg</HI>
appear to have been rather repelled than &s;ubdued. In &s;u|ceeding
<PB N="ix" REF="11">
reigns, we learn from epi&s;odes in the &s;ame poem, that the
chiefs of Atha made &s;everal efforts to become monarchs of Ireland,
and to expel the race of Conar.</P>
<P>To Conar &s;ucceeded his &s;on Cormac,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book III.</NOTE> who appears to have reign|ed
long. In his latter days he &s;eems to have been driven to the
la&s;t extremity, by an in&s;urrection of the <HI>Firbolg,</HI> who &s;upported the
preten&s;ions of the chiefs of Atha to the Iri&s;h throne. Fingal, who
then was very young, came to the aid of Cormac, totally defeated
Colc-ulla,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book IV.</NOTE> chief of Atha, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed Cormac in the &s;ole
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Ireland. It was then he fell in love with, and took
to wife, Ros-crana, the daughter of Cormac, who was the mother
of O&s;&s;ian.</P>
<P>CORMAC was &s;ucceeded in the Iri&s;h throne by his &s;on, Cairbre;
Cairbre by Artho, his Son, who was the father of that Cormac, in
who&s;e minority the inva&s;ion of Swaran happened, which is the &s;ub|ject
of the poem of <HI>Fingal.</HI> The family of Atha, who had not
relinqui&s;hed their preten&s;ions to the Iri&s;h throne, rebelled in the mi|nority
of Cormac,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book I.</NOTE> defeated his adherents, and murdered him in the
palace of Temora. Cairbar, lord of Atha, upon this, mounted
the throne. His u&s;urpation &s;oon ended with his life; for Fingal
made an expedition into Ireland, and re&s;tored, after various vici&s;&s;i|tudes
of fortune, the family of Conar to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the king|dom.
This war is the &s;ubject of Temora; the events, tho' cer|tainly
heightened and embelli&s;hed by poetry, &s;eem, notwith&s;tand|ing,
to have their foundation in true hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>OSSIAN has not only pre&s;erved the hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t migration
of the Caledonians into Ireland, he has al&s;o delivered &s;ome impor|tant
<PB N="x" REF="12">
facts, concerning the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the <HI>Firbolg,</HI> or <HI>Belgae of
Britain,</HI> in that kingdom, under their leader Larthon, who was an|ce&s;tor
to Cairbar and Cathmor, who, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, mounted the Iri&s;h
throne, after the death of Cormac, the &s;on of Artho. I forbear to
tran&s;cribe the pa&s;&s;age, on account of its length. It is the &s;ong of
Fonar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book VII.</NOTE> the bard; towards the latter end of the &s;eventh book of
Temora. As the generations from Larthon to Cathmor, to whom
the epi&s;ode is addre&s;&s;ed, are not marked, as are tho&s;e of the family
of Conar, the fir&s;t king of Ireland, we can form no judgment
of the time of the &s;ettlement of the Firbolg. It is, however,
probable, it was &s;ome time before the <HI>Ca&euml;l,</HI> or Caledonians, &s;ettled
in Ul&s;ter.&mdash;One important fact may be gathered from this hi&s;tory
of O&s;&s;ian, that the Iri&s;h had no king before the latter end of the
fir&s;t century. Fingal lived, it is certain, in the third century; &s;o
Conar, the fir&s;t monarch of the Iri&s;h, who was his grand-uncle,
cannot be placed farther back than the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t. The e&s;ta|bli&s;hing
of this fact, lays, at once, a&s;ide the pretended antiquities
of the Scotch and Iri&s;h, and cuts off the long li&s;t of kings which
the latter give us for a millennium before.</P>
<P>OF the affairs of Scotland, it is certain, nothing can be depended
upon, prior to the reign of Fergus, the &s;on of Erc, who lived in
the fifth century. The true hi&s;tory of Ireland begins &s;omewhat
later than that period.<NOTE PLACE="marg">War. de an|tiq. Hybern. prae. p. 1.</NOTE> Sir James Ware, who was indefatigable in
his re&s;earches after the antiquities of his country, rejects, as mere
fiction and idle romance, all that is related of the antient Iri&s;h,
before the time of St. Patrick, and the reign of Leogairc. It is
from this con&s;ideration, that he begins his hi&s;tory at the introduc|tion
of chri&s;tianity, remarking, that all that is delivered down,
concerning the times of pagani&s;m, were tales of late invention,
<PB N="xi" REF="13">
&s;trangely mixed with anachroni&s;ms and incon&s;i&s;tencies. Such being
the opinion of Ware, who had collected, with uncommon indu&s;try
and zeal, all the real and pretendedly antient manu&s;cripts, concern|ing
the hi&s;tory of his country, we may, on his authority, reject the
improbable and &s;elf-condemned tales of Keating and O'Flaherty.
Credulous and puerile to the la&s;t degree, they have di&s;graced the
antiquities they meant to e&s;tabli&s;h. It is to be wi&s;hed, that &s;ome
able Iri&s;hman, who under&s;tands the language and records of his
country, may redeem, ere it is too late, the genuine antiquities of
Ireland, from the hands of the&s;e idle fabuli&s;ts.</P>
<P>BY comparing the hi&s;tory pre&s;erved by O&s;&s;ian with the legends of
the Scotch and Iri&s;h writers, and, by afterwards examining both by
the te&s;t of the Roman authors, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cover which is the
mo&s;t probable. Probability is all that can be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the au|thority
of tradition, ever dubious and uncertain. But when it fa|vours
the hypothe&s;is laid down by cotemporary writers of undoubted
veracity, and, as it were, fini&s;hes the figure of which they only
drew the out-lines, it ought, in the judgment of &s;ober rea&s;on, to
be preferred to accounts framed in dark and di&s;tant periods, with
little judgment, and upon no authority.</P>
<P>CONCERNING the period of more than a century, which inter|venes
between Fingal and the reign of Fergus, the &s;on of Erc or
Arcath, tradition is dark and contradictory. Some trace up the fa|mily
of Fergus to a &s;on of Fingal of that name, who makes a
con&s;iderable figure in O&s;&s;ian's poems. The three elder &s;ons of Fin|gal,
O&s;&s;ian, Fillan, and Ryno, dying, without i&s;&s;ue, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
of cour&s;e, devolved upon Fergus, the fourth &s;on and his po&s;terity.
This Fergus, &s;ay &s;ome traditions, was the father of Congal, who&s;e
<PB N="xii" REF="14">
&s;on was Arcath, the father of Fergus, properly called the fir&s;t king of
Scots, as it was in his time the <HI>Ca&euml;l,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the we&s;tern
coa&s;t of Scotland, began to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, by foreigners, by the
name of <HI>Scots.</HI> From thence forward, the Scots and Picts, as di&s;|tinct
nations, became objects of attention to the hi&s;torians of other
countries. The internal &s;tate of the two Caledonian kingdoms
has always continued, and ever mu&s;t remain, in ob&s;curity and fable.</P>
<P>IT is in this epoch we mu&s;t fix the beginning of the decay of
that &s;pecies of heroi&s;m, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the days of O&s;&s;ian.
There are three &s;tages in human &s;ociety. The fir&s;t is the re&s;ult of
con&s;anguinity, and the natural affection of the members of a fa|mily
to one another. The &s;econd begins when property is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
and men enter into a&s;&s;ociations for mutual defence, again&s;t
the inva&s;ions and inju&s;tice of neighbours. Mankind &s;ubmit, in the
third, to certain laws and &s;ubordinations of government, to which
they tru&s;t the &s;afety of their per&s;ons and property. As the fir&s;t is
formed on nature, &s;o, of cour&s;e, it is the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted
and noble. Men, in the la&s;t, have lei&s;ure to cultivate the mind,
and to re&s;tore it, with reflection, to a primaeval dignity of &s;enti|ment.
The middle &s;tate is the region of compleat barbari&s;m and
ignorance. About the beginning of the fifth century, the Scots
and Picts were advanced into the &s;econd &s;tage, and, con&s;equently,
into tho&s;e circum&s;cribed &s;entiments, which always di&s;tingui&s;h bar|barity.&mdash;The
events which &s;oon after happened did not at all con|tribute
to enlarge their ideas, or mend their national character.</P>
<P>ABOUT the year 426, the Romans, on account of dome&s;|tic
commotions, entirely for&s;ook Britain, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to
defend &s;o di&s;tant a frontier. The Picts Scots, &s;eizing this fa|vourable
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">
opportunity, made incur&s;ions into the de&s;erted province.
The Britons, enervated by the &s;lavery of &s;everal centuries, and tho&s;e
vices, which are in&s;eparable from an advanced &s;tate of civility, were
not able to with&s;tand the impetuous, tho' irregular attacks of a bar|barous
enemy. In the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, they applied to their old
ma&s;ters, the Romans, and (after the unfortunate &s;tate of the Em|pire
could not &s;pare aid) to the Saxons, a nation equally barbarous
and brave, with the enemies of whom they were &s;o much afraid.
Tho' the bravery of the Saxons repelled the Caledonian nations for
a time, yet the latter found means to extend them&s;elves, con&s;ider|ably,
towards the South. It is, in this period, we mu&s;t place the
origin of the arts of civil life among the Scots. The &s;eat of go|vernment
was removed from the mountains to the plain and more
fertile provinces of the South, to be near the common enemy, in
ca&s;e of &s;udden incur&s;ions. In&s;tead of roving thro' unfrequented
wilds, in &s;earch of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, by means of hunting, men applied
to agriculture, and rai&s;ing of corn. This manner of life was the
fir&s;t means of changing the national character.&mdash;The next thing
which contributed to it was their mixture with &s;trangers.</P>
<P>IN the countries which the Scots had conquered from the Bri|tons,
it is probable the mo&s;t of the old inhabitants remained.
The&s;e, incorporating with the conquerors, taught them agriculture,
and other arts, which they them&s;elves had received from the Ro|mans.
The Scots, however, in number as well as power, being the
mo&s;t predominant, retained &s;till their language, and as many of
the cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors, as &s;uited with the nature of the
country they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Even the union of the two Caledonian
kingdoms did not much affect the national character. Being ori|ginally
de&s;cended from the &s;ame &s;tock, the manners of the Picts and
<PB N="xiv" REF="16">
Scots were as &s;imilar as the different natures of the countries they
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed permitted.</P>
<P>WHAT brought about a total change in the genius of the Scots
nation, was their wars, and other tran&s;actions with the Saxons.
Several counties in the &s;outh of Scotland were alternately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by the two nations. They were ceded, in the ninth age, to the
Scots, and, it is probable, that mo&s;t of the Saxon inhabitants re|mained
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands. During the &s;everal conque&s;ts
and revolutions in England, many fled, for refuge, into Scotland, to
avoid the oppre&s;&s;ion of foreigners, or the tyranny of dome&s;tic u&s;urp|ers;
in &s;o much, that the Saxon race formed perhaps near one half
of the Scotti&s;h kingdom. The Saxon manners and language daily
gained ground, on the tongue and cu&s;toms of the antient Caledoni|ans,
till, at la&s;t, the latter were entirely relegated to inhabitants
of the mountains, who were &s;till unmixed with &s;trangers.</P>
<P>IT was after the acce&s;&s;ion of territory which the Scots received,
upon the retreat of the Romans from Britain, that the inhabitants
of the Highlands were divided into clans. The king, when he
kept his court in the mountains, was con&s;idered, by the whole na|tion,
as the chief of their blood. Their &s;mall number, as well as
the pre&s;ence of their prince, prevented tho&s;e divi&s;ions, which, af|terwards,
&s;prung forth into &s;o many &s;eparate tribes. When the
&s;eat of government was removed to the &s;outh, tho&s;e who remain|ed
in the Highlands were, of cour&s;e, neglected. They naturally
formed them&s;elves into &s;mall &s;ocieties, independent of one another.
Each &s;ociety had its own <HI>reg$l$s,</HI> who either was, or, in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of a few generations, was regarded as chief of their blood.&mdash;The
nature of the country favoured an in&s;titution of this &s;ort.
<PB N="xv" REF="17">
A few valleys, divided from one another by exten&s;ive heaths and
impa&s;&s;ible mountains, form the face of the Highlands. In the&s;e
valleys the chiefs fixed their re&s;idence. Round them, and almo&s;t
within &s;ight of their dwellings, were the habitations of their re|lations
and dependents.</P>
<P>THE &s;eats of the Highland chiefs were neither di&s;agreeable nor
inconvenient. Surrounded with mountains and hanging woods,
they were covered from the inclemency of the weather. Near them
generally ran a pretty large river, which, di&s;charging it&s;elf, not far
off, into an arm of the &s;ea, or exten&s;ive lake, &s;warmed with va|riety
of fi&s;h. The woods were &s;tocked with wild-fowl; and the
heaths and mountains behind them were the natural &s;eat of the red|deer
and roe. If we make allowance for the backward &s;tate of agri|culture,
the valleys were not unfertile; affording, if not all the
conveniences, at lea&s;t the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Here the chief lived,
the &s;upreme judge and law-giver of his own people; but his &s;way
was neither &s;evere nor unju&s;t. As the populace regarded him as the
chief of their blood, &s;o he, in return, con&s;idered them as members
of his family. His commands, therefore, tho' ab&s;olute and deci|&s;ive,
partook more of the authority of a father, than of the rigor of
a judge.&mdash;Tho' the whole territory of the tribe was con&s;idered as
the property of the chief, yet his va&s;&s;als made him no other con&s;i|deration
for their lands than &s;ervices, neither burden&s;ome nor fre|quent.
As he &s;eldom went from home, he was at no expence.
His table was &s;upplied by his own herds, and what his numerous
attendants killed in hunting.</P>
<P>IN this rural kind of magnificence, the Highland chiefs lived, for
may ages. At a di&s;tance from the &s;eat of government, and &s;e|cured,
<PB N="xvi" REF="18">
by the inacce&s;&s;iblene&s;s of their country, they were free and
independent. As they had little communication with &s;trangers, the
cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors remained among them, and their lan|guage
retained its original purity. Naturally fond of military fame,
and remarkably attached to the memory of their ance&s;tors, they
delighted in traditions and &s;ongs, concerning the exploits of their
nation, and e&s;pecially of their own particular families. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of bards was retained in every clan, to hand down the memorable
actions of their forefathers. As the aera of Fingal, on account of
O&s;&s;ian's poems, was the mo&s;t remarkable, and his chiefs the mo&s;t
renowned names in tradition, the bards took care to place one of
them in the genealogy of every great family.&mdash;That part of the
poems, which concerned the hero who was regarded as ance&s;tor,
was pre&s;erved, as an authentic record of the antiquity of the fami|ly,
and was delivered down, from race to race, with wonderful ex|actne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE bards them&s;elves, in the mean time, were not idle. They
erected their immediate patrons into heroes, and celebrated them in
their &s;ongs. As the circle of their knowledge was narrow, their
ideas were confined in proportion. A few happy expre&s;&s;ions, and
the manners they repre&s;ent, may plea&s;e tho&s;e who under&s;tand the
language; their ob&s;curity and innacuracy would di&s;gu&s;t in a tran|&s;lation.&mdash;It
was chiefly, for this rea&s;on, that I kept wholly to the
compo&s;itions of O&s;&s;ian, in my former and pre&s;ent publication. As
he acted in a more exten&s;ive &s;phere, his ideas are more noble and
univer&s;al; neither has he &s;o many of tho&s;e peculiarities, which are
only under&s;tood in a certain period or country. The other bards
have their beauties, but not in that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition in which
O&s;&s;ian excels. Their rhimes, only calculated to kindle a martial
<PB N="xvii" REF="19">
&s;pirit among the vulgar, afford very little plea&s;ure to genuine ta&s;te.
This ob&s;ervation only regards their poems of the heroic kind; in
every other &s;pecies of poetry they are more &s;ucce&s;sful. They ex|pre&s;s
the tender melancholy of de&s;ponding love, with irre&s;i&s;tible &s;im|plicity
and nature. So well adapted are the &s;ounds of the words to
the &s;entiments, that, even without any knowledge of the language,
they pierce and di&s;&s;olve the heart. Succe&s;sful love is expre&s;&s;ed with
peculiar tenderne&s;s and elegance. In all their compo&s;itions, except
the heroic, which was &s;olely calculated to animate the vulgar, they
give us the genuine language of the heart, without any of tho&s;e
affected ornaments of phra&s;eology, which, tho'intended to beautify
&s;entiments, dive&s;t them of their natural force. The ideas, it is
confe&s;&s;ed, are too local, to be admired, in another language; to
tho&s;e, who are acquainted with the manners they repre&s;ent, and the
&s;cenes they de&s;cribe, they mu&s;t afford the highe&s;t plea&s;ure and &s;a|tisfaction.</P>
<P>IT was the locality of his de&s;cription and &s;entiment, that, pro|bably,
kept O&s;&s;ian &s;o long in the ob&s;curity of an almo&s;t lo&s;t lan|guage.
His ideas, tho' remarkably proper for the times in which
he lived, are &s;o contrary to the pre&s;ent advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety,
that more than a common mediocrity of ta&s;te is required, to
reli&s;h his poems as they de&s;erve.&mdash;Tho&s;e who alone were capable
to make a tran&s;lation were, no doubt, con&s;cious of this, and cho&s;e
rather to admire their poet in &s;ecret, than &s;ee him received, with
coldne&s;s, in an Engli&s;h dre&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE were long my own &s;entiments, and, accordingly, my fir&s;t
tran&s;lations, from the Galic, were merely accidental. The publi|cation,
which &s;oon after followed, was &s;o well received, that I was
<PB N="xviii" REF="20">
obliged to promi&s;e to my friends a larger collection. In a journey
thro' the Highlands and i&s;les, and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of corre&s;pon|dents,
&s;ince I left that country, all the genuine remains of the
works of O&s;&s;ian have come to my hands. In the publication of
la&s;t year compleat poems were only given. Unfini&s;hed and imper|fect
poems were purpo&s;ely omitted; even &s;ome pieces were rejected,
on account of their length, and others, that they might not break
in upon that thread of connection, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the le&s;&s;er
compo&s;itions, &s;ubjoined to <HI>Fingal.</HI>&mdash;That the comparative merit of
pieces was not regarded, in the &s;election, will readily appear to tho&s;e
who &s;hall read, attentively, the pre&s;ent collection.&mdash;It is ani|mated
with the &s;ame &s;pirit of poetry, and the &s;ame &s;trength of
&s;entiment is &s;u&s;tained throughout.</P>
<P>THE opening of the poem of Temora made its appearance in the
la&s;t collection. The &s;econd book, and &s;everal other epi&s;odes, have
only fallen into my hands lately. The &s;tory of the poem, with
which I had been long acquainted, enabled me to reduce the broken
members of the piece into the order in which they now appear.
For the ea&s;e of the reader, I have divided it my&s;elf into books, as
I had done before with the poem of <HI>Fingal.</HI> As to the merit of
the poem I &s;hall not anticipate the judgment of the public. My
impartiality might be &s;u&s;pected, in my accounts of a work, which,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, is become my own. If the poem of Fingal met
with the applau&s;e of per&s;ons of genuine ta&s;te, I &s;hould al&s;o hope,
that Temora will not di&s;plea&s;e them.</P>
<P>BUT what renders Temora infinitely more valuable than Fingal,
is the light it throws on the hi&s;tory of the times. The fir&s;t po|pulation
of Ireland, its fir&s;t kings, and &s;everal circum&s;tances, which
<PB N="xix" REF="21">
regard its connection of old with the &s;outh and north of Britain,
are pre&s;ented to us, in &s;everal epi&s;odes. The &s;ubject and cata&s;trophe
of the poem are founded upon facts, which reagarded the fir&s;t
peopling of that country, and the conte&s;ts between the two Bri|ti&s;h
nations, which originally inhabited it.&mdash;In a preceding part of
this di&s;&s;ertation, I have &s;hewn how &s;uperior the probability of O&s;|&s;ian's
traditions is to the undige&s;ted fictions of the Iri&s;h bards, and
the more recent and regular legends of both Iri&s;h and Scotch hi&s;|torians.
I mean not to give offence to the abettors of the high
antiquities of the two nations, tho' I have all along expre&s;&s;ed my
doubts, concerning the veracity and abilities of tho&s;e who deliver
down their antient hi&s;tory. For my own part, I prefer the na|tional
fame, ari&s;ing from a few certain facts, to the legendary and
uncertain annals of ages of remote and ob&s;cure antiquity. No
kingdom, now e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe, can pretend to equal antiqui|ty
with tho&s;e of Ireland and Scotland, even according to my &s;y&s;tem,
&s;o that it is altogether needle&s;s to fix their origin a fictitious millen|nium
before. This &s;ubject I have only lightly touched upon, as it
is to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, with more per&s;picuity, and at a much greater
length, by a gentleman, who has thoroughly examined the anti|quities
of Britain and Ireland.</P>
<P>SINCE the publication of the la&s;t collection of O&s;&s;ian's poems,
many in&s;inuations have been made, and doubts ari&s;en, concerning
their authenticity. I &s;hall, probably, hear more of the &s;ame kind
after the pre&s;ent poems &s;hall make their appearance. Whether
the&s;e &s;u&s;picions are &s;ugge&s;ted by prejudice, or are only the effects of
ignorance of facts, I &s;hall not pretend to determine.&mdash;To me they
give no concern, as I have it always in my power to remove them.
An incredulity of this kind is natural to per&s;ons, who con&s;ine all
<PB N="xx" REF="22">
merit to their own age and country. The&s;e are generally the weak|e&s;t,
as well as the mo&s;t ignorant, of the people. Indolently con|fined
to a place, their ideas are narrow and circum&s;cribed.&mdash;It is ri|diculcus
enough to &s;ee &s;uch people as the&s;e are, branding their an|ce&s;tors,
with the de&s;picable appellation of barbarians. Sober rea|&s;on
can ea&s;ily di&s;cern, where the title ought to be fixed, with more
propriety.</P>
<P>As prejudice is always the effect of ignorance, the knowing, the
men of true ta&s;te, de&s;pi&s;e and di&s;mi&s;s it. If the poetry is good,
and the characters natural and &s;triking, to them it is a matter of
indifference, whether the heroes were born in the little village of
Angles in Juteland, or natives of the barren heaths of Caledonia.
That honour which nations derive from ance&s;tors, worthy, or re|nowned;
is merely ideal. It may buoy up the minds of individu|als,
but it contributes very little to their importance in the eyes of
others.&mdash;But of all tho&s;e prejudices which are incident to narrow
minds, that which mea&s;ures the merit of performances by the vul|gar
opinion, concerning the country which produced them, is cer|tainly
the mo&s;t ridiculous. Ridiculous, however, as it is, few have
the courage to reject it; and, I am thoroughly convinced, that a
few quaint lines of a Roman or Greek epigrammati&s;t, if dug out of
the ruins of Herculaneum, would meet with more cordial and uni|ver&s;al
applau&s;e, than all the mo&s;t beautiful and natural rhap&s;odies of
all the Celtic bards and Scandinavian Scalders that ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>WHILE &s;ome doubt the authenticity of the compo&s;itions of O&s;&s;ian,
others &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavour to appropriate them to the Iri&s;h nation.
Tho' the whole tenor of the poems &s;ufficiently contradict &s;o ab&s;urd an
opinion, it may not be improper, for the &s;atisfaction of &s;ome, to examine
the narrow foundation, on which this extraordinary claim is built.</P>
<P><PB N="xxi" REF="23">
OF all the nations de&s;cended from the antient <HI>Celtae,</HI> the Scots
and Iri&s;h are the mo&s;t &s;imilar in language, cu&s;toms, and man|ners.
This argues a more intimate connection between them,
than a remote de&s;cent from the great Celtic &s;tock. It is evident,
in &s;hort, that, at &s;ome one period or other, they formed one
&s;ociety, were &s;ubject to the &s;ame government, and were, in all
re&s;pects, one and the &s;ame people. How they became divided,
which the colony, or which the mother nation, does not fall now
to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The fir&s;t circum&s;tance that induced me to di&s;regard
the vulgarly-received opinion of the Hibernian extraction of the
Scotch nation, was my ob&s;ervations on their antient language. That
dialect of the Celtic tongue, &s;poken in the north of Scotland, is
much more pure, more agreeable to its mother language, and more
abounding with primitives, than that now &s;poken, or even that
which has been writ for &s;ome centuries back, among&s;t the mo&s;t un|mixed
part of the Iri&s;h nation. A Scotchman, tolerably conver&s;ant
in his own language, under&s;tands an Iri&s;h compo&s;ition, from that
derivative analogy which it has to the <HI>Galic</HI> of North-Britain. An
Iri&s;hman, on the other hand, without the aid of &s;tudy, can never
under&s;tand a compo&s;ition in the <HI>Galic</HI> tongue.&mdash;This affords a proof,
that the <HI>Scotch Galic</HI> is the mo&s;t original, and, con&s;equently, the
language of a more antient and unmixed people. The Iri&s;h, how|ever
backward they may be to allow any thing to the prejudice of
their antiquity, &s;eem inadvertently to acknowledge it, by the very
appellation they give to the dialect they &s;peak.&mdash;They call their own
language <HI>Ca&euml;lic Eirinach,</HI> i. e. <HI>Caledonian Iri&s;h,</HI> when, on the con|trary,
they call the dialect of North-Britain <HI>a Cha&euml;lic,</HI> or the <HI>Cale|donian
tongue,</HI> emphatically. A circum&s;tance of this nature tends
more to decide which is the mo&s;t antient nation, than the united
<PB N="xxii" REF="24">
te&s;timonies of a whole legion of ignorant bards and &s;enachies, who,
perhaps, never dreamed of bringing the Scots from Spain to Ire|land,
till &s;ome one of them, more learned than the re&s;t, di&s;covered,
that the Romans called the fir&s;t <HI>Iberia,</HI> and the latter <HI>Hibernia.</HI> On
&s;uch a &s;light foundation were probably built tho&s;e romantic fictions,
concerning the Mile&s;ians of Ireland.</P>
<P>FROM internal proofs it &s;ufficiently appears, that the poems pu|bli&s;hed
under the name of O&s;&s;ian, are not of Iri&s;h compo&s;ition.
The favourite chimaera, that Ireland is the mother-country of the
Scots, is totally &s;ubverted and ruined. The fictions, concerning the
antiquities of that country, which were forming for ages, and grow|ing,
as they came down, on the hands of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive <HI>&s;enachies</HI> and
<HI>fileas,</HI> are found, at la&s;t, to be the &s;purious brood of modern and
ignorant ages. To tho&s;e who know how tenacious the Iri&s;h are, of
their pretended <HI>Iberian</HI> de&s;cent, this alone is proof &s;ufficient, that
poems, &s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of their &s;y&s;tem, could never be produced by
an Hibernian bard.&mdash;But when we look to the language, it is &s;o
different from the Iri&s;h dialect, that it would be as ridiculous to
think, that Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t could be wrote by a Scotch pea|&s;ant,
as to &s;uppo&s;e, that the poems a&s;cribed to O&s;&s;ian were writ in
Ireland.</P>
<P>THE preten&s;ions of Ireland to O&s;&s;ian proceed from another quar|ter.
There are handed down, in that country, traditional poems,
concerning the <HI>Fiona,</HI> or the heroes of <HI>Fion Mac Comnal.</HI> This
<HI>Fion,</HI> &s;ay the Iri&s;h annali&s;ts, was general of the militia of Ireland,
in the reign of Cormac, in the third century. Where Keating and
O'Flaherty learned, that Ireland had an <HI>embodied</HI> militia &s;o early, is
not ea&s;y for me to determine. Their information certainly did not
<PB N="xxiii" REF="25">
come from the Iri&s;h poems, concerning <HI>Fion.</HI> I have ju&s;t now, in
my hands, all that remain, of tho&s;e compo&s;itions; but, unluckily
for the antiquities of Ireland, they appear to be the work of a very
modern period. Every &s;tanza, nay almo&s;t every line, affords &s;trik|ing
proofs, that they cannot be three centuries old. Their allu|&s;ions
to the manners and cu&s;toms of the fifteenth century, are &s;o
many, that it is matter of wonder to me, how any one could dream
of their antiquity. They are entirely writ in that romantic ta&s;te,
which prevailed two ages ago.&mdash;Giants, enchanted ca&s;tles, dwarfs,
palfreys, witches and magicians form the whole circle of the
poet's invention. The celebrated <HI>Fion</HI> could &s;carcely move from one
hillock to another, without encountering a giant, or being entangled
in the circles of a magician. Witches, on broom&s;ticks, were con|tinually
hovering round him, like crows; and he had freed enchant|ed
virgins in every valley in Ireland. In &s;hort, <HI>Fion,</HI> great as he
was, had but a bad &s;ort of life of it.&mdash;Not only had he to engage
all the mi&s;chiefs in his own country, foreign armies invaded him,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by magicians and witches, and headed by kings, as tall as
the main-ma&s;t of a fir&s;t rate.&mdash;It mu&s;t be owned, however, that
<HI>Fion</HI> was not inferior to them in height.</P>

<L><HI>FION</HI> from <HI>ALBION,</HI> race of heroes!</L></Q>
Were it allowable to contradict the authority of a bard, at this di&s;|tance
of time, I &s;hould have given, as my opinion, that this enor|mous
<HI>Fion</HI> was of the race of the Hibernian giants, of Ruanus, or
&s;ome other celebrated name, rather than a native of Caledonia,
who&s;e inhabitants, now at lea&s;t, are not remarkable for their &s;ta|ture.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Fion</HI> was &s;o remarkable for his &s;tature, his heroes had al&s;o
other extraordinary properties. <HI>In weight all the &s;ons of &s;trangers</HI> yield|ed
to the celebrated Ton-io&s;al; and for hardne&s;s of &s;kull, and, per|haps,
for thickne&s;s too, the valiant O&s;car &s;tood <HI>unrivalled and alone.</HI>
O&s;&s;ian him&s;elf had many &s;ingular and le&s;s delicate qualifications, than
playing on the harp; and the brave Cuchullin was of &s;o diminutive
a &s;ize, as to be taken for a child of two years of age, by the gi|gantic
Swaran. To illu&s;trate this &s;ubject, I &s;hall here lay before
the reader, the hi&s;tory of &s;ome of the Iri&s;h poems, concerning
<HI>Fion Mac Comnal.</HI> A tran&s;lation of the&s;e pieces, if well executed,
might afford &s;atisfaction to the public. But this ought to be the
work of a native of Ireland. To draw forth, from ob&s;curity, the
poems of my own country, has afforded ample employment to me;
be&s;ides, I am too diffident of my own abilities, to undertake &s;uch a
work. A gentleman in Dublin accu&s;ed me to the public, of com|mitting
blunders and ab&s;urdities, in tran&s;lating the language of my
<PB N="xxv" REF="27">
own country, and that before any tran&s;lation of mine appeared<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>In Faulkner's Dublin Journal, of the 1&s;t December, 1761, appeared the following Adverti&s;ement:</P>
<P>Speedily will be publi&s;hed, by a Gentleman of this kingdom, who hath been, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, employed in tran&s;lating and writing Hi&s;torical Notes to
<Q>FINGAL, A POEM,</Q>
Originally wrote in the Iri&s;h or Er&s;e language. In the preface to which, the tran&s;lator, who is a perfect ma&s;ter of the Iri&s;h tongue, will give an account of the manners and cu&s;toms of the antient Iri&s;h or Scotch; and, therefore, mo&s;t humbly intreats the pub|lic, to wait for his edition, which will appear in a &s;hort time, as he will &s;et forth all the blunders and ab&s;urdities in the edition now printing in London, and &s;hew the ig|norance of the Engli&s;h tran&s;lator, in his knowlege of Iri&s;h grammar, not under&s;tand|ing any part of that accidence.</P></NOTE>.
How the gentleman came to &s;ee my blunders before I committed
them, is not ea&s;y to determine; if he did not conclude, that, as a
Scot&s;man, and, of cour&s;e, de&s;cended of the Mile&s;ian race, I might
have committed &s;ome of tho&s;e over&s;ights, which, perhaps very un|ju&s;tly,
are &s;aid to be peculiar to them.</P>
<P>FROM the whole tenor of the Iri&s;h poems, concerning the <HI>Fiona,</HI>
it appears, that <HI>Fion Mac Comnal</HI> flouri&s;hed in the reign of Cormac,
which is placed, by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of the &s;enachies, in the
third century. They even fix the death of Fingal in the year 286,
yet his &s;on O&s;&s;ian is made cotemporary with St. Patrick, who
preached the go&s;pel in Ireland about the middle of the fifth age.
O&s;&s;ian, tho', at that time, he mu&s;t have been two hundred and fif|ty
years of age, had a daughter young enough to become wife to
the &s;aint. On account of this family connection, <HI>Patrick of the
P&s;alms,</HI> for &s;o the apo&s;tle of Ireland is emphatically called in the
poems, took great delight in the company of O&s;&s;ian, and in hearing
<PB N="xxvi" REF="28">
the great actions of his family. The &s;aint &s;ometimes threw off the
au&s;terity of his profe&s;&s;ion, drunk freely, and had his &s;oul properly
warmed with wine, in order to hear, with becoming enthu&s;ia&s;m,
the poems of his father-in-law. One of the poems begins with this
piece of u&s;eful information.</P>
<Q><L>Lo don rabh PADRIC na mh&uacute;r,</L>
<L>Gun <HI>Sailm</HI> air uidh, ach a g&oacute;l,</L>
<L>Ghluais &eacute; thigh <HI>O&s;&s;ian</HI> mhic <HI>Fhion,</HI></L>
<L>O &s;an leis bu bhinn a ghloir.</L></Q>
<P>The title of this poem is, <HI>Teantach mor na Fiona.</HI> It appears to
have been founded on the &s;ame &s;tory with the <HI>battle of Lora,</HI> one of
the poems of the genuine O&s;&s;ian. The circum&s;tances and cata|&s;trophe
in both are much the &s;ame; but the <HI>Iri&s;h O&s;&s;ian</HI> di&s;covers
the age in which he lived, by an unlucky anachroni&s;m. After de|&s;cribing
the total route of Erragon, he very gravely concludes with
this remarkable anecdote, that none of the foe e&s;caped, but a few,
who were allowed to go on a pilgrimage to the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> This
circum&s;tance fixes the date of the compo&s;ition of the piece &s;ome
centuries after the famous croi&s;ade; for, it is evident, that the poet
thought the time of the croi&s;ade &s;o antient, that he confounds it
with the age of Fingal.&mdash;Erragon, in the cour&s;e of this poem, is
often called,
<Q><L>Riogh <HI>Lochlin</HI> an do &s;hloigh,</L>
<L>King of Denmark of two nations,</L></Q>
which alludes to the union of the kingdoms of Norway and Den|mark,
a circum&s;tance which brings down the date of the piece to
<PB N="xxvii" REF="29">
an aera, not far remote. Modern, however, as this pretended O&s;|&s;ian
was, it is certain, he lived before the Iri&s;h had dreamded of ap|propriating
<HI>Fion,</HI> or <HI>Fingal,</HI> to them&s;elves. He concludes the poem,
with this reflection:
<Q><L>Na fagha &s;e comhthr&oacute;m nan n' arm,</L>
<L>Eragon Mac Annir nan l&aacute;nn glas</L>
<L>'San n' ALBIN ni n' abairtair Triath</L>
<L>Agus ghlaoite an n'<HI>Fhiona</HI> as.</L></Q>
&startq;Had Erragon, &s;on of Annir of gleaming &s;words, avoided the
equal conte&s;t of arms (&s;ingle combat) no chief &s;hould have after|wards
been numbered in ALBION, and the heroes of Fion &s;hould
no more be named.&endq;</P>
<P>THE next poem that falls under our ob&s;ervation is <HI>Cath-cabhra,</HI>
or, <HI>The death of O&s;car.</HI> This piece is founded on the &s;ame &s;tory
which we have in the fir&s;t book of Temora. So little thought the
author of <HI>Cath-cabhra</HI> of making O&s;car his countryman, that, in
the cour&s;e of two hundred lines, of which the poem con&s;i&s;ts, he
puts the following expre&s;&s;ion thrice in the mouth of the hero:
<Q><L>ALBIN an &s;a d' roina m' arach.&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>ALBION</HI> where I was born and bred.</L></Q>
The poem contains almo&s;t all the incidents in the fir&s;t book of Te|mora.
In one circum&s;tance the bard differs materially from O&s;&s;ian.
O&s;car, after he was mortally wounded by Cairbar, was carried by
his people to a neighbouring hill, which commanded a pro&s;pect of
<PB N="xxviii" REF="30">
the &s;ea. A fleet appeared at a di&s;tance, and the hero exclaims with
ioy,
<Q><L>Loingeas mo &s;hean-athair at' &aacute;n</L>
<L>'S iad a ti&auml;chd le cabhair chugain,</L>
<L>O ALBIN na n' ioma &s;tuagh.</L></Q>
&startq;It is the fleet of my grandfather, coming with aid to our field,
from ALBION of many waves!&endq;&mdash;The te&s;timony of this bard is
&s;ufficient to confute the idle fictions of Keating and O'Flaherty;
for, tho' he is far from being antient, it is probable, he flouri&s;hed
a full century before the&s;e hi&s;torians.&mdash;He appears, however, to
have been a much better chri&s;tian than chronologer; for <HI>Fion,</HI>
tho' he is placed two centuries before St. Patrick, very devoutly re|commends
the &s;oul of his grand&s;on of his Redeemer.</P>
<P><HI>Duan a Gharibh Mac-Starn</HI> is another Iri&s;h poem in high repute.
The grandeur of its images, and its propriety of &s;entiment, might
have induced me to give a tran&s;lation of it, had not I &s;ome expec|tations
of &s;eeing it in the collection of the Iri&s;h O&s;&s;ian's poems,
promi&s;ed, more than a year &s;ince, to the public. The author de|&s;cends
&s;ometimes from the region of the &s;ublime to low and inde|cent
de&s;cription; the la&s;t of which, the Iri&s;h tran&s;lator, no doubt,
will choo&s;e to leave in the ob&s;curity of the original.&mdash;In this piece
Cuchullin is u&s;ed with very little ceremony, for he is oft called,
the <HI>dog of Tara,</HI> in the county of Meath. This &s;evere title of the
<HI>redoubtable Cuchullin,</HI> the mo&s;t renowned of Iri&s;h champions, pro|ceeded
from the poet's ignorance of etymology. Cu, <HI>voice,</HI> or
<HI>commander,</HI> &s;ignifies al&s;o a <HI>dog.</HI> The poet cho&s;e the la&s;t, as the
mo&s;t noble appellation for his hero.</P>
<P><PB N="xxix" REF="31">
THE &s;ubject of the poem is the &s;ame with that of the epic poem
of Fingal. <HI>Garibh Mac-Starn</HI> is the &s;ame with O&s;&s;ian's Swaran,
the &s;on of Starno. His &s;ingle combats with, and his victory
over all the heroes of Ireland, excepting the <HI>celebrated dog of Tara'</HI>
i. e. Cuchullin, afford matter for two hundred lines of tolerable
poetry. <HI>Garibh</HI>'s progre&s;s in &s;earch of Cuchullin, and his intrigue
with the gigantic Emir-bragal, that hero's wife, enables the poet
to extend his piece to four hundred lines. This author, it is true,
makes Cuchullin a native of Ireland; the gigantic Emir-bragal he
calls, <HI>the guiding &s;tar of the women of Ireland.</HI> The property of
this enormous lady I &s;hall not di&s;pute with him, or any other. But,
as he &s;peaks with great tenderne&s;s of the <HI>daughters of the convent,</HI>
and throws out &s;ome hints again&s;t the Engli&s;h nation, it is pro|bable
he lived in too modern a period to be intimately acquainted
with the genealogy of Cuchullin.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Iri&s;h O&s;&s;ian (for there were many, as appears from
their difference in language and &s;entiment) &s;peaks very dogmati|cally
of <HI>Fion Mac Comnal,</HI> as an Iri&s;hman. Little can be &s;aid for
the judgment of this poet, and le&s;s for his delicacy of &s;entiment.
The hi&s;tory of one of his epi&s;odes may, at once, &s;tand as a &s;peci|men
of his want of both. Ireland, in the days of <HI>Fion,</HI> happened
to be threatned with an inva&s;ion, by three great potentates, the
kings of Lochlin, Sweden, and France. It is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t up|on
the impropriety of a French inva&s;ion of Ireland; it is &s;ufficient
for me to be faithful to the language of my author. <HI>Fion,</HI> upon
receiving intelligence of the intended inva&s;ion, &s;ent Ca-olt, O&s;&s;ian,
and O&s;car, to watch the bay, in which, it was apprehended, the
enemy was to land. O&s;car was the wor&s;t choice of a &s;cout that
could be made, for, brave as he was, he had the bad property of
falling very often a&s;leep on his po&s;t, nor was it po&s;&s;ible to awake
<PB N="xxx" REF="32">
him, without cutting off one of his fingers, or da&s;hing a large
&s;tone again&s;t his head. When the enemy appeared, O&s;car, very
unfortunately, was a&s;leep. O&s;&s;ian and Ca-olt con&s;ulted about the
method of wakening him, and they, at la&s;t, fixed on the &s;tone, as
the le&s;s dangerous expendient.</P>
<Q><L>Gun thog Caoilte a chlach, nach g&aacute;n,</L>
<L>Agus a n' aighai' chiean gun bhuail;</L>
<L>Tri mil an tulloch gun chri', &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>&startq;Ca-olt took up a heavy &s;tone, and &s;truck it again&s;t the hero's
head. The hill &s;hook for three miles, as the &s;tone rebounded and
rolled away.&endq; O&s;car ro&s;e in wrath, and his father gravely de&s;ired
him to &s;pend his rage on his enemies, which he did to &s;o good pur|po&s;e,
that he &s;ingly routed a whole wing of their army. The con|federate
kings advanced, notwith&s;tanding, till they came to a narrow
pa&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the celebrated Ton-io&s;al. This name is very &s;ig|nificant
of the &s;ingular property of the hero who bore it. Ton|io&s;al,
tho' brave, was &s;o heavy and unwieldy, that, when he &s;at
down, it took the whole force of an hundred men to &s;et him up|right
on his feet again. Luckily for the pre&s;ervation of Ireland, the
hero happened to be &s;tanding when the enemy appeared, and he
gave &s;o good an account of them, that <HI>Fion,</HI> upon his arrival, found
little to do, but to divide the &s;poil among his &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e extraordinary heroes, Fion, O&s;&s;ian, O&s;car and Ca|olt,
&s;ays the poet, were
<Q><L>Siol ERIN na gorm l&aacute;nn.</L>
<L>The &s;ons of <HI>ERIN</HI> of blue &s;teel.</L></Q>
<PB N="xxxi" REF="33">
Neither &s;hall I much di&s;pute the matter with him: He has my
con&s;ent al&s;o to appropriate to Ireland the celebrated Ton-io&s;al. I
&s;hall only &s;ay, that they are different per&s;ons from tho&s;e of the
&s;ame name, in the Scotch poems; and that, tho' the &s;tupenduous
valour of the fir&s;t is &s;o remarkable, they have not been equally
lucky with the latter, in their poet. It is &s;omewhat extraordinary,
that <HI>Fion,</HI> who lived &s;ome ages before St. Patrick, &s;wears like a
very good chri&s;tian:
<Q><L>Air an Dia do chum gach <HI>ca&s;e.</HI></L>
<L>By God, who &s;haped every ca&s;e.</L></Q>
It is worthy of being remarked, that, in the line quoted, O&s;&s;ian,
who lived in St. Patrick's days, &s;eems to have under&s;tood &s;omething
of the Engli&s;h, a language not then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. A per&s;on, more
&s;anguine for the honour of his country than I am, might argue,
from this circum&s;tance, that this pretendedly Iri&s;h O&s;&s;ian was a
native of Scotland; for my countrymen are univer&s;ally allowed
to have an exclu&s;ive right to the &s;econd-&s;ight.</P>
<P>FROM the in&s;tances given, the reader may form a compleat idea
of the Iri&s;h compo&s;itions concerning the <HI>Fiona.</HI> The greate&s;t part
of them make the heroes of <HI>Fion,</HI>
<Q><L>Siol ALBIN a n'nioma caoile.</L>
<L>The race of <HI>ALBION</HI> of many firths.</L></Q>
The re&s;t make them natives of Ireland. But, the truth is, that
their authority is of little con&s;equence on either &s;ide. From the in|&s;tances
I have given, they appear to have been the work of a very
<PB N="xxxii" REF="34">
modern period. The pious ejaculations they contain, their allu&s;ions
to the manners of the times, fix them to the fifteenth century.
Had even the authors of the&s;e pieces avoided all allu&s;ions to their
own times, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the poems could pa&s;s for ancient, in
the eyes of any per&s;on tolerably conver&s;ant with the Iri&s;h tongue.
The idiom is &s;o corrupted and &s;o many words borrowed from the
Engli&s;h, that that language mu&s;t have made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in
Ireland before the poems were writ.</P>
<P>IT remains now to &s;hew, how the Iri&s;h bards begun to appropri|ate
O&s;&s;ian and his heroes to their own country. After the Engli&s;h
conque&s;t, many of the natives of Ireland, aver&s;e to foreign yoke,
either actually were in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility with the conquerors, or at
lea&s;t, paid little regard to their government. The Scots, in tho&s;e
ages, were often in open war, and never in cordial friend&s;hip with
the Engli&s;h. The &s;imilarity of manners and language, the tradi|ons
concerning their common origin, and above all, their having to
do with the &s;ame enemy, created a free and friendly intercour&s;e be|tween
the Scotch and Iri&s;h nations. As the cu&s;tom of retaining
bards and &s;enachies was common to both; &s;o each, no doubt, had
formed a &s;y&s;tem of hi&s;tory, it matters not how much &s;oever fabalous,
concerning their re&s;pective origin. It was the natural policy of the
times, to reconcile the traditions of both nations together, and, if
po&s;&s;ible, to deduce them from the &s;ame original &s;tock.</P>
<P>The Saxon manners and language had, at that time, made great pro|gre&s;s
in the &s;outh of Scotland. The ancient language, and the tradi|tional
hi&s;tory of the nation, became confined entirely to the inhabitants
of the Highlands, then fallen, from &s;everal concurring circum&s;tances,
into the la&s;t degree of ignorance and barbari&s;m. The Iri&s;h, who,
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="35">
for &s;ome ages before the conque&s;t, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a competent &s;hare
of that kind of learning, which then prevailed in Europe, found it
no difficult matter to impo&s;e their own fictions on the ignorant
Highland &s;enachies. By flattering the vanity of the Highlanders,
with their long li&s;t of Heremonian kings and heroes, they, without
contradiction, a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the character of being the mo|ther-nation
of the Scots of Britain. At this time, certainly, was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
that Hibernian &s;y&s;tem of the original of the Scots, which af|terwards,
for want of any other, was univer&s;ally received. The Scots, of
the low-country, who, by lo&s;ing the language of their ance&s;tors, lo&s;t,
together with it, their national traditions, received, implicitly, the
hi&s;tory of their country, from Iri&s;h refugees, or from Highland &s;ena|chies,
per&s;uaded over into the Hibernian &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THESE circum&s;tances, are far from being ideal. We have re|maining
many particular traditions, which bear te&s;timony to a fact,
of it&s;elf abundantly probable. What makes the matter inconte&s;tible
is, that the antient traditional accounts of the genuine origin of the
Scots, have been handed down without interruption. Tho' a few
ignorant &s;enachies might be per&s;uaded out of their own opinion, by
the &s;moothne&s;s of an Iri&s;h tale, it was impo&s;&s;ible to eradicate, from
among the bulk of the people, their own national traditions. The&s;e
traditions afterwards &s;o much prevailed, that the Highlanders con|tinue
totally unacquainted with the pretended Hibernian extract of
the Scots nation. Ignorant chronicle writers, &s;trangers to the an|tient
language of their country, pre&s;erved only from falling to the
ground, &s;o improbable a &s;tory.</P>
<P>IT was, during the period I have mentioned, that the iri&s;h be|came
acquainted with, and carried into their country, the compo&s;i|tions
of O&s;&s;ian. The &s;eene of many of the pieces being in Ireland,
&s;ugge&s;ted fir&s;t to them a hint, of making both heroes and poet na|tives
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="36">
of that I&s;land. In order to do this effectually, they found it
nece&s;&s;ary, to reject the genuine poems, as every line was pregnant
with proofs of their Scotch original, and to dre&s;s up a fable, on the
&s;ame &s;ubject, in their own language. So ill qualified, however, were
their bards to effectuate this change, that amid&s;t all their de&s;ires to
make the <HI>Fiona</HI> Iri&s;hmen, they every now and then call <HI>Siol Albin.</HI> It
was, probably, after a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome generations, that the
bards had effrontery enough to e&s;tabli&s;h an Iri&s;h genealogy for <HI>Fion,</HI>
and deduce him from the Mile&s;ian race of kings. In &s;ome of the
olde&s;t Iri&s;h poems, on the &s;ubject, the great-grand-father of <HI>Fion</HI> is
made a Scandinavian; and his heroes are often called SIOL LOCHLIN
NA DEUM; <HI>i. e. the race of Lochlin of wounds.</HI> The only poem
that runs up the family of <HI>Fion</HI> to Nuades Niveus, king of Ireland, is
evidently not above a hundred and fifty years old; for, if I mi&s;take
not, it mentions the Earl of Tyrone, &s;o famous in Elizabeth's time.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject, perhaps, is pur&s;ued further than it de&s;erves;
but, a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the preten&s;ions of Ireland to O&s;&s;ian, was become
in &s;ome mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary. If the Iri&s;h poems, concerning the <HI>Fi|ona,</HI>
&s;hould appear ridiculous, it is but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that they
are &s;carcely more &s;o than the poems of other nations, at that period.
On other &s;ubjects, the bards of Ireland have di&s;played a genius worthy
of any age or nation. It was, alone, in matters of antiquity, that
they were mon&s;trous in their fables. Their love-&s;onnets, and their
$egies on the death of per&s;ons worthy or renowned, abound with
&s;uch beautiful &s;implicity of &s;entiment, and wild harmony of num|bers,
that they become more than an attonement for their errors, in
every other &s;pecies of poetry. But the beauty of the&s;e pieces, depend
&s;o much on a certain <HI>curio&s;a &s;elicitas</HI> of expre&s;&s;ion in the original,
that they mu&s;t app$ar much to di&s;advantage in another language.</P>

<Q><P>CAIRBAR, the &s;on of Borbar-duthul, lord of Atha in Connaught, the mo&s;t potent
chief of the race of the Firbolg, having murdered, at Temora the royal palace,
Cormac the &s;on of Artho, the young king of Ireland, u&s;urped the throne. Cormac
was lineally de&s;cended from Conar the fon of Trenmor, the great grandfather of
Fingal, king of tho&s;e Caledonians who inhabited the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland.
Fingal re&s;ented the behaviour of Cairbar, and re&s;olved to pa&s;s over into Ireland, with
an army, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the royal family on the Iri&s;h throne. Early intelligence of
his de&s;igns coming to Cairbar, he a&s;&s;embled &s;ome of his tribes in Ul&s;ter, and at the
&s;ame time ordered his brother Cathmor to follow him &s;peedily with an army, from
Temora. Such was the &s;ituation of affairs when the Caledonian fleet appeared on
the coa&s;t of Ul&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE poem opens in the morning. Cairbar is repre&s;ented as retired from the re&s;t
of the army, when one of his &s;couts brought him news of the landing of Fingal.
He a&s;&s;embles a council of his chiefs. Foldath the chief of Moma haughtily de&s;pi&s;es
the enemy; and is reprimanded warmly by Malthos. Cairbar, after hearing their
debate, orders a fea&s;t to be prepared, to which, by his bard Olla, he invites O&s;car
the &s;on of O&s;&s;ian; re&s;olving to pick a quarrel with that hero, and &s;o have &s;ome pre|text
for killing him. O&s;car came to the fea&s;t; the quarrel happened; the followers
of both fought, and Cairbar and O&s;car fell by mutual wounds. The noi&s;e of the
battle reached Fingal's army. The king came on, to the relief of O&s;car, and the
Iri&s;h fell back to the army of Cathmor, who was advanced to the banks of the river.
Lubar, on the heath of Moilena. Fingal, after mourning over his grand&s;on, or|dered
Ullin the chief of his bards to carry his body to Morven, to be there interred.
Night coming on, Althan, the &s;on of Conachar, relates to the king the particulars
of the murder of Cormac. Fillan, the &s;on of Fingal, is &s;ent to ob&s;erve the mo|tions
of Cathmor by night, which concludes the action of the fir&s;t day. The &s;cene
of this book is a plain, near the hill of Mora, which ro&s;e on the borders of the
heath of Moilena, in Ul&s;ter.</P></Q>

<HEAD>TEMORA:
AN
EPIC POEM<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The fir&s;t book of Temora made its appearance in the collection of le&s;&s;er pieces, which were &s;ubjoined to the epic poem of Fingal. When that collection was print|ed, little more than the opening of the pre&s;ent poem came, in a regular connec|tion, to my hands. The &s;econd book, in particular, was very imperfect and con|fu&s;ed. By means of my friends, I have &s;ince collected all the broken fragments of Temora, that I formerly wanted; and the &s;tory of the poem, which was accurately pre&s;erved by many, enabled me to reduce it into that order in which it now appears. The title of Epic was impo&s;ed on the poem by my&s;elf. The technical terms of critici&s;m were totally unknown to O&s;&s;ian. Born in a di&s;tant age, and in a country re|mote from the &s;eats of learning, his know|ledge did not extend to Greek and Roman literature. If therefore, in the form of his poems, and in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of his dic|tion, he re&s;embles Homer, the &s;imilarity mu&s;t proceed from nature, the original from which both drew their ideas. It is from this con&s;ideration that I have avoided, in this publication, to give parallel pa&s;&s;ages from other authors, as I had done, in &s;ome of my notes, on the former collection of O&s;&s;ian's poems. It was far from my in|tention to rai&s;e my author into a competi|tion with the celebrated names of antiqui|ty. The exten&s;ive field of renown affords ample room to all the poetical merit which has yet appeared in the world, without overturning the character of one poet, to rai&s;e that of another on its ruins. Had O&s;&s;ian even &s;uperior merit to Homer and Virgil, a certain partiality, ari&s;ing from the &s;ame de&s;ervedly be&s;towed upon them by the &s;anction of &s;o many ages, would make us overlook it, and give them the prefe|rence. Tho' their high merit does not &s;tand in need of adventitious aid, yet it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that it is an ad|vantage to their fame, that the po&s;terity of the Greeks and Romans, either do not at all exi&s;t, or are not now objects of contempt or envy to the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>Tho' this poem of O&s;&s;ian has not per|haps all the <HI>minutiae,</HI> which Ari&s;totle, from Homer, lays down as nece&s;&s;ary to the con|duct of an epic poem, yet, it is pre&s;umed, it has all the grand e&s;&s;entials of the epo|poea. Unity of time, place, and action is pre&s;erved throughout. The poem opens in the mid&s;t of things; what is nece&s;&s;ary of preceding tran&s;actions to be known, is in|troduced by epi&s;odes afterwards; not for|mally brought in, but &s;eemingly ri&s;ing im|mediately from the &s;ituation of affairs. The circum&s;tances are grand, and the diction animated; neither de&s;cending into a cold meanne&s;s, nor &s;welling into ridiculous bom|ba&s;t.</P>
<P>The reader will find &s;ome alterations in the &s;tyle of this book. The&s;e are drawn from more correct copies of the original which came to my hands, &s;ince the former publication. As the mo&s;t part of the poem is delivered down by tradition, the &s;tyle is &s;ometimes various and interpolated. After comparing the different readings, I always made choice of that which agreed be&s;t with the &s;pirit of the context.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

We heard<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Fingal's army heard the joy that was in Cairbar's camp. The character given of Cathmor is agreeable to the times. Some, through o&s;tentation, were ho&s;pitable; and other &s;ell naturally into a cu&s;tom handed down from their ance&s;tors. But what marks &s;trongly the character of Cathmor, is his aver&s;ion to prai&s;e; for he is repre&s;ented to dwell in a wood to avoid the thanks of his gue&s;ts; which is &s;till a higher degree of genero&s;ity than that of Axylus in Ho|mer: for the poet does not &s;ay, but the good man might, at the head of his own table, have heard with plea&s;ure the prai&s;e be&s;towed on him by the people he enter|tained.</P>
<P>No nation in the world carried ho&s;pitality to a greater length than the ancient Scots. It was even infamous, for many ages, in a man of condition, to have the door of his hou&s;e &s;hut at all, LEST, as the bards expre&s;s it, THE STRANGER SHOULD COME AND BEHOLD HIS CONTRACTED SOUL. Some of the chiefs were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this ho&s;pi|table di&s;po&s;ition to an extravagant degree; and the bards, perhaps upon a private ac|count, never failed to recommend it, in their eulogiums, <HI>Cean uia' na dai',</HI> or <HI>the point to which all the roads of the &s;trang|ers lead,</HI> was an invariable epithet given by them to the chiefs; on the contrary, they di&s;tingui&s;hed the inho&s;pitable by the title of <HI>the cloud which the &s;trangers &s;hun.</HI> This la&s;t however was &s;o uncommon, that in all the old poems I have ever met with, I found but one man branded with this ignomini|ous appellation; and that, perhaps, only founded upon a private quarrel, which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between him and the patron of the bard, who wrote the poem.</P>
<P>We have a &s;tory of this ho&s;pitable na|ture, handed down by tradition, concern|ing one of the fir&s;t Earls of Argyle. This nobleman, hearing that an Iri&s;hman, of great quality, intended to make him a vi|&s;it, with a very numerous retinue of his friends and dependants, burnt the ca&s;tle of Dunora, the &s;eat of his family, le&s;t it &s;hould be too &s;mall to entertain his gue&s;ts, and received the Iri&s;h in tents on the &s;hore. Extravagant as this behaviour might &s;eem in our days, it was admired and applauded in tho&s;e times of ho&s;pitality, and the Earl acquired con&s;iderable fame by it, in the &s;ongs of the bards.</P>
<P>The open communication with one an|other, which was the con&s;equence of their ho&s;pitality, did not a little tend to improve the under&s;tanding and enlarge the ideas of the ancient Scots. It is to this cau&s;e, we mu&s;t attribute that &s;agacity and &s;en&s;e, which the common people, in the highlands, po&s;|&s;e&s;s, &s;till, in a degree &s;uperior even to the vulgar of more poli&s;hed countries. When men are crowded together in great cities they &s;ee indeed many people, but are ac|quainted with few. They naturally form them&s;elves into &s;mall &s;ocieties, and their knowledge &s;carce extends beyond the alley or &s;treet they live in: add to this that the very employment of a mechanic tends to contract the mind. The ideas of a pea|&s;ant are &s;till more confined. His know|ledge is circum&s;cribed within the com|pa&s;s of a few acres; or, at mo&s;t, extends no further than the neare&s;t market-town. The manner of life among the inhabitants of the highlands is very different from the&s;e. As their fields are barren, they have &s;carce any dome&s;tic employment. Their time is &s;pent therefore in an exten&s;ive wilderne&s;s, where they feed their cattle, and the&s;e, by &s;tray|ing far and wide, carry their keepers after them, at times, to all the different &s;ettle|ments of the clans. There they are re|ceived with ho&s;pitality and good cheer, which, as they tend to di&s;play the minds of the ho&s;ts, afford an opportunity to the gue&s;ts to make their ob&s;ervations on the different characters of men; which is the true &s;ource of knowledge and acquired &s;en&s;e.

In the cour&s;e of their altercation, Cairbar &s;aid, in a boa&s;tful manner, that he would hunt on the hills of Albion, and carry the &s;poils of it into Ireland, in &s;pite of all the efforts of its inhabitants. The original words are;

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>THIS book opens, we may &s;uppo&s;e, about midnight, with a &s;oliloquy of O&s;&s;ian, who
had retired, from the re&s;t of the army, to mourn for his &s;on O&s;car. Upon hearing
the noi&s;e of Cathmor's army approaching, he went to find out his brother Fillan,
who kept the watch, on the hill of Mora, in the front of Fingal's army. In the con|ver&s;ation
of the brothers, the epi&s;ode of Conar, the &s;on of Trenmor, who was the
fir&s;t king of Ireland, is introduced, which lays open the origin of the conte&s;ts be|tween
the Ca&euml;l and Firbolg, the two nations who fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of that
i&s;land. O&s;&s;ian kindles a fire on Mora; upon which Cathmor de&s;i&s;ted from the de|&s;ign
he had formed of &s;urpri&s;ing the army of the Caledonians. He calls a council of
his chiefs; reprimands Foldath for advi&s;ing a night-attack, as the Iri&s;h army were
&s;o much &s;uperior in number to the enemy. The bard Fonar introduces the &s;tory of
Crothar, the ance&s;tor of the king, which throws further light on the hi&s;tory of Ire|land,
and the original preten&s;ions of the family of Atha, to the throne of that king|dom.
The Iri&s;h chiefs lie down to re&s;t, and Cathmor him&s;elf undertakes the watch.
In his circuit, round the army, he is met by O&s;&s;ian. The interview of the two he|roes
is de&s;cribed. Cathmor obtains a promi&s;e from O&s;&s;ian, to order a funeral elegy to
be &s;ung over the grave of Cairbar; it being the opinion of the times, that the &s;ouls of
the dead could not be happy, till their elegies were &s;ung by a bard. Morning comes.
Cathmor and O&s;&s;ian part; and the latter, ca&s;ually meeting with Carril the &s;on of
Kinfena, &s;ends that bard, with a funeral &s;ong, to the tomb of Cairbar.</Q>

<P><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Addre&s;&s;es to the &s;pirits of decea&s;ed warriors are common, in the compo&s;itions of O&s;&s;ian. He, however, expre&s;&s;es them in &s;uch language as prevents all &s;u&s;picion of his paying divine honours to the dead, as was u&s;ual among other unenlightened nations.&mdash;From the &s;equel of this apo&s;tro|phe, it appears, that O&s;&s;ian had retired from the re&s;t of the army to mourn, in &s;ecret, over the death of his &s;on O&s;car. This indirect method of narration has much of the nature of the Drama, and is more forcible than a regular hi&s;torical chain of circum&s;tances. The abrupt manner of O&s;&s;ian may often render him ob&s;cure to in|attentive readers. Tho&s;e who retain his poems, on memory, &s;eem to be &s;en&s;ible of this; and u&s;ually give the hi&s;tory of the pieces minutely before they begin to re|peat the poetry.</P>
<P>Tho' this book has little action, it is not the lea&s;t important part of Temora. The poet, in &s;everal epi&s;odes, runs up the cau&s;e of the war to the very &s;ource. The fir&s;t po|pulation of Ireland, the wars between the two nations who originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that i&s;land, its fir&s;t race of kings, and the revolutions of its government, are impor|tant facts, and are delivered by the poet, with &s;o little mixture of the fabulous, that one cannot help preferring his accounts to the improbable fictions of the Scotch and Iri&s;h hi&s;torians. The Mile&s;ian fables of tho&s;e gentlemen bear about them the marks of a late invention. To trace their legends to their &s;ource would be no difficult ta&s;k; but a di&s;qui&s;ition of this &s;ort would extend this note too far.</P></NOTE> FATHER of heroes, Trenmor! dweller of eddying

The &s;hield of Fillan<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We under&s;tand, from the preceding book, that Cathmor was near with an ar|my. When Cairbar was killed, the tribes who attended him fell back to Cathmor; who, as it afterwards appears, had taken a re&s;olution to &s;urprize Fingal by night. Fillan was di&s;patched to the hill of Mo|ra, which was in the front of the Cale|donians, to ob&s;erve the motions of Cath|mor. In this &s;ituation were affairs when O&s;&s;ian, upon hearing the noi&s;e of the ap|proaching enemy, went to find out his brother. Their conver&s;ation naturally in|troduces the epi&s;ode, concerning Conar the &s;on of Trenmor the fir&s;t Iri&s;h monarch, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the under&s;tanding the foundation of the rebellion and u&s;urpa|tion of Cairbar, and Cathmor.&mdash;Fillan was the younge&s;t of the &s;ons of Fingal, then living.

SON of Fingal, replied the youth, it is not long &s;ince I could

It is highly probable, tho' the Iri&s;h annali&s;ts do not agree with O&s;&s;ian in other particu|lars, that the Conar here mentioned is the &s;ame with their <HI>Conar-m&oacute;r,</HI> i. e. <HI>Conar the great,</HI> whom they place in the fir&s;t century.</NOTE> the warrior, till the &s;torm is rolled away.

<P>CONAR<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Conar, the fir&s;t king of Ireland, was the &s;on of Trenmor, the great-grand-fa|ther of Fingal. It was on account of this family-connection, that Fingal was en|gaged in &s;o many wars in the cau&s;e of the race of Conar. Tho' few of the actions of Trenmor are mentioned in O&s;&s;ian's poems, yet, from the honourable appella|tions be&s;towed on him, we may conclude that he was, in the days of th$ poet, the mo&s;t renowned name of antiquity. The mo&s;t probable opinion concerning him is, that he was the fir&s;t, who united the tribes of the Caledonians, and commanded them, in chief, again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Romans. The genealogi&s;ts of the North have traced his family far back, and given a li&s;t of his ance&s;tors to <HI>Cuan-m&oacute;r nan lan,</HI> or Con|mor of the &s;words, who, according to them, was the fir&s;t who cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>great &s;ea,</HI> to Caledonia, from which circum|&s;tance his name proceeded, which &s;ignifies <HI>Great ocean.</HI> Genealogies of &s;o ancient a date, however, are little to be depended upon.</NOTE> was the brother of Trathal, fir&s;t of mortal men.

<Q>MORNING coming on, Fingal, after a &s;peech to his people, devolves the command
on Gaul, the &s;on of Morni; it being the cu&s;tom of the times, that the king &s;hould
not engage, till the nece&s;&s;ity of affairs required his &s;uperior valour and conduct.&mdash;The
king and O&s;&s;ian retire to the rock of Cormul, which overlooked the field of
battle. The bards &s;ing the war-&s;ong. The general conflict is de&s;cribed. Gaul, the
&s;on of Morni, di&s;tingui&s;hes him&s;elf; kills Tur-lathon, chief of Moruth, and other
chiefs of le&s;&s;er name.&mdash;On the other hand, Foldath, who commanded the Iri&s;h
army (for Cathmor, after the example of Fingal, kept him&s;elf from battle) fights
gallantly; kills Connal, chief of Dun-lora, and advances to engage Gaul him&s;elf.
Gaul, in the mean time, being wounded in the hand, by a random arrow, is co|vered
by Fillan, the &s;on of Fingal, who performs prodigies of valour. Night comes
on. The horn of Fingal recalls his army. The bards meet them, with a congra|tulatory
&s;ong, in which the prai&s;es of Gaul and Fillan are particularly celebrated. The
chiefs &s;it down at a fea&s;t; Fingal mi&s;&s;es Connal. The epi&s;ode of Connal and Duth|caron
is introduced; which throws further light on the ancient hi&s;tory of Ireland.
Carril is di&s;patched to rai&s;e the tomb of Connal.&mdash;The action of this book takes

<P><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This &s;udden apo&s;trophe, concerning Fingal, the attitude of the king, and the &s;cenery in which he is placed, tend to elevate the mind to a ju&s;t conception of the &s;ucceeding battle. The &s;peech of Fin|gal is full of that magnanimous genero&s;ity which di&s;tingui&s;hes his character through|out. The groupe of figures, which the poet places around his father, are pictu|re&s;que, and de&s;cribed with great propriety. The &s;ilence of Gaul, the behaviour of Fillan, and the effect which both have on the mind of Fingal, are well imagined.&mdash;His &s;peech upon the occa&s;ion is very beautiful in the original. Broken and unequal, the num|bers repre&s;ent the agitation of his mind, divided between the admiration excited by the &s;ilence of Gaul, (when others boa&s;ted of their own actions) and his natural af|fection for Fillan, which the behaviour of that valiant youth had rai&s;ed to the high|e&s;t pitch.</NOTE> WHO is that, at blue-&s;treaming Lubar; by the bending

into Ireland, and his marriage with Ros-cr&aacute;na, the daughter of Cor|mac,
king of that i&s;land.&mdash;The Iri&s;h chiefs convene in the pre&s;ence of Cath|mor.
The &s;ituation of the king de&s;cribed. The &s;tory of Sul-malla, the daughter
of Conmor, king of Inis-huna, who, in the di&s;gui&s;e of a young warrior, had fol|lowed
Cathmor to the war. The &s;ullen behaviour of Foldath, who had commanded
in the battle of the preceding day, renews the difference between him and Malthos;
but Cathmor, interpo&s;ing, ends it. The chiefs fea&s;t, and hear the &s;ong of Fonar
the bard. Cathmor returns to re&s;t, at a di&s;tance from the army. The gho&s;t of his
brother Cairbar appears to him in a dream; and ob&s;curely foretels the i&s;&s;ue of the

<P><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e abrupt addre&s;&s;es give great life to the poetry of O&s;&s;ian. They are all in a lyric mea&s;ure.

This attachment does not pro|ceed from the &s;uperior beauty of the&s;e ly|ric pieces, but rather from a ta&s;te for rhime which the modern bards have e&s;tabli&s;hed among the highlanders. Having no ge|nius them&s;elves for the &s;ublime and pathe|tic, they placed the whole beauty of poetry in the returning harmony of &s;imilar &s;ounds.

Rhiming, in proce&s;s of time, became &s;o much reduced into a &s;y&s;|tem, and was &s;o univer&s;ally under&s;tood, that every cow-herd compo&s;ed tolerable ver&s;es.

Void of merit as tho&s;e vulgar compo&s;itions were, they fell little &s;hort of the productions of the regular bards; for when all poetical excellence is confined to &s;ounds alone, it is within the power of every one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good $ar.</NOTE> THOU dweller between the &s;hields that hang, on high,

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>THIS book opens with a &s;peech of Fingal, who &s;ees Cathmor de&s;cending to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of his flying army. The king di&s;patches O&s;&s;ian to the relief of Fillan.
He him&s;elf retires behind the rock of Cormul, to avoid the &s;ight of the engage|ment
between his &s;on and Cathmor. O&s;&s;ian advances. The de&s;cent of Cathmor
de&s;cribed. He rallies the army, renews the battle, and, before O&s;&s;ian could arrive,
engages Fillan him&s;elf. Upon the approach of O&s;&s;ian, the combat between the two
heroes cea&s;es. O&s;&s;ian and Cathmor prepare to fight, but night coming on prevents
them. O&s;&s;ian returns to the place where Cathmor and Fillan fought. He finds
Fillan mortally wounded, and leaning again&s;t a rock. Their di&s;cour&s;e. Fillan dies:
his body is laid, by O&s;&s;ian, in a neighbouring cave.&mdash;The Caledonian army return
to Fingal. He que&s;tions them about his &s;on, and, under&s;tanding that he was killed,
retires, in &s;ilence, to the rock of Cormul.&mdash;Upon the retreat of the army of Fingal,
the Fir-bolg advance. Cathmor finds Bran, one of the dogs of Fingal, lying on the
&s;hield of Fillan, before the entrance of the cave, where the body of that hero lay.
His reflexions thereupon. He returns, in a melancholy mood, to his army. Mal|thos
endeavours to comfort him, by the example of his father Borbar-duthul. Cath|mor
retires to re&s;t. The &s;ong of Sul-malla concludes the book, which ends about
the middle of the third night, from the opening of the poem.</Q>

<P><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I have, in a preceding note, ob&s;erved that the abrupt manner of O&s;&s;ian partakes much of the nature of the Drama. The opening of this book is a confirmation of the ju&s;tne&s;s of this ob&s;ervation. In&s;tead of a long detail of circum&s;tances delivered by the poet him&s;elf, about the de&s;cent of Cathmor from the hill, whereon he &s;at to behold the battle, he puts the narration in the mouth of Fingal. The relation ac|quires importance from the character of the &s;peaker. The concern which Fingal &s;hews, when he beholds the <HI>ri&s;ing of Cath|mor,</HI> rai&s;es our ideas of the valour of that hero to the highe&s;t pitch. The apo&s;tro|phes's which are crowded on one ano|ther, are expre&s;&s;ive of the perturbation of Fingal's &s;oul, and of his fear for his &s;on, who was not a match for the king of Ireland. The conduct of the poet in removing Fingal from the &s;ight of the engagement, is very judicious; for the king might be induced, from &s;eeing the inequa|lity of the combat between Fillan and Cath|mor, to come to battle him&s;elf, and &s;o bring about the cata&s;trophe of the poem prematurely. The removal of Fingal af|fords room to the poet for introducing tho&s;e affecting &s;cenes which immediately &s;ucceed, and are among the chief beauties of the poem.&mdash;They who can deny art to O&s;&s;ian, in conducting the cata&s;trophe of Temora, are certainly more prejudiced again&s;t the age he lived in, than is con&s;i&s;tent with good &s;en&s;e. I cannot fini&s;h this note, without ob&s;erving the delicacy and proprie|ty of Fingal's addre&s;s to O&s;&s;ian. By the appellation of the <HI>father of O&s;car,</HI> he rai&s;es, at once, in the mind of the hero, all that tenderne&s;s for the &s;afety of Fillan, which a &s;ituation &s;o &s;imilar to that of his own &s;on, when he fell, was capable to &s;ugge&s;t.</NOTE> CATHMOR ri&s;es on his echoing hill! Shall Fingal take
the &s;word of Luno? But what &s;hould become of thy fame,
&s;on of white-bo&s;omed Clatho? Turn not thine eyes from Fingal,
daughter of Ini&s;tore. I &s;hall not quench thy early beam; it &s;hines
<PB N="100" REF="136">
along my &s;oul.&mdash;Ri&s;e, wood-&s;kirted Mora, ri&s;e between the war
and me! Why &s;hould Fingal behold the &s;trife, le&s;t his dark|haired
warrior &s;hould fall!&mdash;Amid&s;t the &s;ong, O Carril, pour the
&s;ound of the trembling harp: here are the voices of rocks, and
bright tumbling of waters. Father of O&s;car lift the &s;pear; defend
the young in arms. Conceal thy &s;teps from Fillan's eyes.&mdash;He mu&s;t
not know that I doubt his &s;teel.&mdash;No cloud of mine &s;hall ri&s;e, my
&s;on, upon thy &s;oul of fire!</P>
<P>HE &s;unk behind his rock, amid&s;t the &s;ound of Carril's &s;ong.&mdash;Brightening,
in my growing &s;oul, I took the &s;pear of Temora<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>&s;pear of Temora</HI> was that which O&s;car had received, in a pre&s;ent, from Cormac, the &s;on of Artho, king of Ire|land. It was of it that Cairbar made the pretext for quarrelling with O&s;car, at the fea&s;t, in the fir&s;t book. After the death of O&s;car we find it always in the hands of O&s;&s;ian. It is &s;aid, in another poem, that it was pre&s;erved, as a relique, at Te|mora, from the days of Conar, the &s;on of Trenmor, the fir&s;t king of Ireland.</NOTE>
I &s;aw, along Moi-lena, the wild tumbling of battle, the &s;trife of
death, in gleaming rows, disjoined and broken round. Fillan is a
beam of fire; from wing to wing is his wa&s;teful cour&s;e. The
ridges of war melt before him. They are rolled, in &s;moak, from
the fields.</P>

<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The appearance of Cathmor is mag|nificent: his unconcerned gait, and the effect which his very voice has upon his flying army, are circum&s;tances calcu|lated to rai&s;e our ideas of his &s;uperior me|rit and valour. O&s;&s;ian is very impartial, with regard to his enemies: this, how|ever, cannot be &s;aid of other poets of great eminence and unque&s;tioned merit. Mil|ton, of the fir&s;t cla&s;s of poets, is undoubt|edly the mo&s;t irreprehen&s;ible in this re|&s;pect; for we always pity or admire his Devil, but &s;eldom dete&s;t him, even tho' he is the arch enemy of our &s;pecies. Man|kind generally take &s;ides with the unfortu|nate and daring. It is from this di&s;po&s;ition that many readers, tho' otherwi&s;e good chri&s;tians, have almo&s;t wi&s;hed &s;ucce&s;s to Satan, in his de&s;perate and daring voyage from hell, through the regions of chaos and night.</NOTE>Now is the coming forth of Cathmor, in the armour of kings!
Dark-rolled the eagle's wing, above his helmet of fire. Uncon|cerned

&s;teps of their fear: for he ro&s;e, like the beam of the morning on a
haunted heath: the traveller looks back, with bending eye, on the
field of dreadful forms.</P>
<P>SUDDEN, from the rock of Moi-lena, are Sul-malla's trembling
&s;teps. An oak took the &s;pear from her hand; half-bent &s;he loo&s;ed the

&mdash;As different bla&s;ts fly over the &s;ea, each behind its dark-blue
wave, &s;o Cathmor's words, on every &s;ide, poured his warriors forth.
&mdash;Nor &s;ilent on his hill is Fillan; he mixed his words with his

my daring &s;teps. I will con&s;ume in wrath<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Here the &s;entence is de&s;ignedly left unfini&s;hed by the poet. The &s;en&s;e is, that he was re&s;olved, like a de&s;troying fire, to con&s;ume Cathmor, who had killed his bro|ther. In the mid&s;t of this re&s;olution, the &s;ituation of Fingal &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf to him, in a very &s;trong light. He re&s;olves to return to a&s;&s;i&s;t the king in pro&s;ecuting the war.&mdash;But then his &s;hame for not defending his brother, recurs to him&mdash;He is determined again to go and find out Cathmor.&mdash;We may con&s;ider him, as in the act of advancing towards the enemy, when the horn of Fingal &s;ounded on Mora, and called back his people to his pre&s;ence.&mdash;This &s;oliloquy is natural: the re&s;olu|tions which &s;o &s;uddenly follow one ano|ther, are expre&s;&s;ive of a mind extremely agitated with &s;orrow and con&s;cious &s;hame; yet the behaviour of O&s;&s;ian, in his execution of the commands of Fingal, is &s;o irrepre|hen&s;ible, that it is not ea&s;y to determine where he failed in his duty. The truth is, that when men fail in de&s;igns which they ardently wi&s;h to accompli&s;h, they naturally blame them&s;elves, as the chief cau&s;e of their di&s;appointment. The compari&s;on, with which the poet concludes his &s;oliloquy, is very fanciful; and well adapted to the ideas of tho&s;e, who live in a country, where light|ning is extremely common.</NOTE>&mdash;Should I not re|turn!
the king is without a &s;on, grey-haired amid&s;t his foes. His
arm is not as in the days of old: his fame grows dim in Erin.
Let me not behold him from high, laid low in his latter field.&mdash;But

His voice was no thunder to their ears: his eye &s;ent forth no death.</HI>&mdash;The fir&s;t ages of &s;o|ciety are not the times of arbitrary power.

<P>It is a vulgar error, that the common Highlanders lived, in abject &s;lavery, under their chiefs. Their high ideas of, and at|tachment to, the heads of their families, probably, led the unintelligent into this mi&s;take.&mdash;When the honour of the tribe was concerned, the commands of the chief were obeyed, without re&s;triction: but, if individuals were oppre&s;&s;ed, they threw them&s;elves into the arms of a neighbour|ing clan, a&s;&s;umed a new name, and were encouraged and protected. The fear of this de&s;ertion, no doubt, made the chiefs cautious in their government. As their con&s;equence, in the eyes of others, was in proportion to the number of their people, they took care to avoid every thing that tended to dimini&s;h it.</P>
<P>It was but very lately that the authority of the laws extended to the Highlands. Be|fore that time the clans were governed, in civil affairs, not by the verbal commands of the chief, but by what they called <HI>Clechda,</HI> or the traditional precedents of their an|ce&s;tors. When differences happened be|tween individuals, &s;ome of the olde&s;t men in the tribe were cho&s;en umpires between the parties, to decide according to the <HI>Clechda.</HI> The chief interpo&s;ed his autho|rity, and, invariably, enforced the deci&s;ion.&mdash;In their wars, which were frequent, on account of family-feuds, the chief was le&s;s re&s;erved in the execution of his authority; and even then he &s;eldom extended it to the taking the life of any of his tribe.&mdash;No crime was capital, except murder; and that was very unfrequent in the highlands. No corporal puni&s;hment, of any kind, was inflicted. The memory of an affront of this &s;ort would remain, for ages, in a fa|mily, and they would &s;eize every opportu|nity to be revenged, unle&s;s it came imme|diately from the hands of the chief him&s;elf; in that ca&s;e it was taken, rather as a fa|therly correction, than a legal puni&s;hment for offences.</P></NOTE>.</P>

No far-fetched ornaments are introduced; the epi&s;odes ri&s;e from, and are indeed e&s;&s;ential to, the &s;tory of the poem. Even his lyric &s;ongs, where he mo&s;t in|dulges the extravagance of fancy, natural|ly &s;pring from his &s;ubject. Their propriety and connection with the re&s;t of the poem, &s;hew that the Celtic bard was guided by judgment, amid&s;t the wilde&s;t &s;lights of ima|gination. It is a common &s;uppo&s;ition among mankind, that a genius for poetry and &s;ound &s;en&s;e &s;eldom centre in the &s;ame per&s;on. The ob&s;ervation is far from being ju&s;t; for true genius and judgment mu&s;t be in&s;eparable. The wild &s;lights of fan|cy, without the guidance of judgment, are, as Horace ob&s;erves, like the dreams of a &s;ick man, irk&s;ome and confu&s;ed. Fools can never write good poems. A warm imagination, it is true, domineers over a common portion of &s;en&s;e; and hence it is that &s;o few have &s;ucceeded in the poetical way. But when an uncommon &s;trength of judgment, and a glowing fancy, are properly tempered together, they, and they only, produce genuine poetry.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent book is not the lea&s;t inte|re&s;ting part of Temora. The awful images, with which it opens, are calculated to pre|pare the mind for the &s;olemn &s;cenes which are to follow. O&s;&s;ian, always, throws an air of con&s;equence on every circum&s;tance which relates to Fingal. The very &s;ound of his &s;hield produces extraordinary effects; and the&s;e are heightened, one above ano|ther, in a beautiful climax. The di&s;tre&s;s of Sul-malla, and her conference with Cathmor, are very affecting. The de|&s;cription of his &s;hield is a curious piece of antiquity; and is a proof of the early knowledge of navigation among the inha|bitants of Britain and Ireland. O&s;&s;ian, in &s;hort, throughout this book, is often &s;u|blime, and always pathetic.</P>
<P>As a &s;pecimen of the harmony of Galic ver&s;ification without rhime, I &s;hall lay a few lines, of the opening of this book, before tho&s;e who under&s;tand the origi|nal. The words are not, after the Iri&s;h manner, bri&s;tled over with unnece&s;&s;ary quie&s;cent con&s;onants, &s;o di&s;agreeable to the eye, and which rather embara&s;s than a&s;&s;i&s;t the reader.</P>

<P>Lego, &s;o often mentioned by O&s;&s;ian, was a lake, in Connaught, in which the river Lara emptied it&s;elf. On the banks of this lake dwelt Branno, the father-in-law of O&s;&s;ian, whom the poet often vi&s;ited before and after the death of Evir-allin. This circum&s;tance, perhaps, occa&s;ioned the partiality, with which he always men|tions Lego and Lara; and accounts for his drawing &s;o many of his images from them. The &s;ignification of Leigo, is, <HI>the lake of di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> probably &s;o called, on account of the mora&s;&s;es which &s;urrounded it.</P>
<P>As the mi&s;t, which ro&s;e from the lake of Lego, occa&s;ioned di&s;ea&s;es and death, the bards feigned, as here, that it was the re&s;idence of the gho&s;ts of the decea&s;ed, during the interval between their death, and the pronouncing of the funeral elegy over their tombs; for it was not allowable, without that ceremony was performed, for the &s;pirits of the dead to mix with their ance&s;tors, <HI>in their airy halls.</HI> It was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;pirit of the neare&s;t relation to the decea&s;ed, to take the mi&s;t of Lego, and pour it over the grave. We find here Conar, the &s;on of Trenmor, the fir&s;t king of Ireland, according to the O&s;&s;ian, perform|ing this office for Fillan, as it was in the cau&s;e of the family of Conar, that that he|ro was killed. The de&s;cription of the ap|pearance of the gho&s;t is picture&s;que and &s;olemn, impo&s;ing a &s;till attention to the &s;peech that follows it, which, with great propriety, is &s;hort and awful.</P></NOTE> FROM the wood-&s;kirted waters of Lego, a&s;cend, at times,

<P>IT is<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>It has been ob&s;erved, that O&s;&s;ian takes great delight in de&s;cribing night-&s;cenes. This, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, is to be attributed to his melancholy di&s;po&s;ition, which de|lighted to dwell upon &s;olemn objects. Even other poets, of a le&s;s &s;erious turn than O&s;|&s;ian, have be&s;t &s;ucceeded in de&s;criptions of this &s;ort.

They &s;ay, that Fingal, in one of his expeditions into Scandinavia, met, in one of the i&s;lands of Juteland, with Luno, a celebrated magician. This Luno was the Vulcan of the north, and had made com|pleat &s;uits of armour for many of the heroes of Scandinavia. One di&s;agreeable circum|&s;tance was, that every per&s;on who wanted to employ Luno to make armour for him, was obliged to overcome him, at his own magic art.&mdash;Fingal, un&s;killed in &s;pells or enchantments, effected with dint of prow|e&s;s, what others failed in, with all their &s;upernatural art. When Luno demanded a trial of &s;kill from Fingal, the king drew his &s;word, cut off the &s;kirts of the magi|cian's robe, and obliged him, bare as he was, to fly before him. Fingal pur&s;ued, but Luno, coming to the &s;ea, by his ma|gic art, walked upon the waves. Fingal pur&s;ued him in his &s;hip&punc; and, after a chace of ten days, came up with him, in the i&s;le of Sky, and obliged him to erect a furnace, and make him this &s;hield, and his famous &s;ord, poetically called, <HI>the &s;on of Luno.</HI>&mdash;Such are the &s;trange fictions which the modern Scotch and Iri&s;h bards have formed on the original of O&s;&s;ian.</NOTE> that hung high in night, the di&s;mal &s;ign

<P><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>A bard, &s;everal ages more modern than O&s;&s;ian, was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the beauty of this pa&s;&s;age, as to give a clo&s;e imitation of it, in a poem, concerning the great ac|tions of Keneth Mac-Alpin, king of Scot|land, again&s;t the Picts. As the poem is long, I &s;hall only give here the &s;tory of it, with a tran&s;lation of that paragraph, which bears the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to the pa&s;&s;age of Temora ju&s;t now before me. When Keneth was making preparations for that war, which terminated in the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the Picti&s;h kingdom, Flathal, his &s;i&s;ter, had demanded permi&s;&s;ion from him, of attending him in the expedition; in order to have a &s;hare in revenging the death of her father Alpin, who had been barbarou&s;ly murdered by the Picts. The king, tho' he, perhaps, approved of the gallant di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;i&s;ter, refu&s;ed, on account of her &s;ex, to grant her reque&s;t. The heroine, however, dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in the habit of a young warrior; and, in that di&s;gui&s;e, attended the army, and perform|ed many gallant exploits. On the night preceding the final overthrow of the Picts, Keneth, as was the cu&s;tom among the kings of Scots, retired to a hill, without the verge of the camp, to meditate on the di&s;po&s;itions he was to make in the ap|proaching battle. Flathal, who was anxi|ous about the &s;afety of her brother, went, privately, to the top of an adjoining rock, and kept watch there to prevent his being &s;urprized by the enemy.&mdash;Keneth fell a&s;leep, in his arms; and Flathal ob&s;erved a body of the Picts &s;urrounding the hill, whereon the king lay.&mdash;The &s;equel of the &s;tory may be gathered form the words of the bard.</P>
<P>&startq;Her eyes, like &s;tars, roll over the plain. She trembled for Alpin's race. She &s;aw the gleaming foe. Her &s;teps aro&s;e: &s;he &s;topt.&mdash;&startq;Why &s;hould he know of Fla|thal? he the king men!&mdash;But hark! the &s;ound is high.&mdash;It is but the wind of night, lone-whi&s;tling in my locks.&mdash;I hear the echoing &s;hields!&endq;&mdash;Her &s;pear fell from her hand. The lo&s;ty rock re&s;ounds.&mdash;He ro&s;e, a gathered cloud.</P>
<P>Who wakes Conad of Albion, in the mid&s;t of his &s;ecret hill? I heard the &s;oft voice of Flathal. Why, maid, do&s;t thou &s;hine in war? The daughters roll their blue eyes, by the &s;treams. No field of blood is theirs.</P>
<P>Alpin of Albion was mine, the father of Flathal of harps. He is low, mighty Conad, and my &s;oul is $ire. Could Flathal, by the &s;ecret &s;tream, behold the blood of her foes? I am a young eagle, on Dura, king of Drum-albin of winds.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>In the &s;equel of the piece, the bard does not imitate O&s;&s;ian, and his poem is &s;o much the wor&s;e for it.&mdash;Keneth, with his &s;i&s;ter's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, forced his way thro' the advanced parties of the enemy, and re|joined his own army. The bard has given a catalogue of the Scotch tribes, as they marched to battle; but, as he did not live near the time of Keneth, his accounts are to be little depended on.</P></NOTE> No &s;leep was thine in darkne&s;s, blue-eyed daughter of Con|mor!

I have met with a poem, which was writ three centuries age, in which the bard recom|mends, to a lady of his own times, the behaviour of Sul-malla, in this place. The poem has little to recommend it, except|ing the pa&s;&s;age, of which I am to give a tran&s;lation here. The bards, when they alluded to the works of O&s;&s;ian, &s;eem to have caught &s;ome portion of his fire: upon other occa&s;ions, their compo&s;itions are lit|tle more than a group of epithets reduced into mea&s;ure. Only their poems, upon martial &s;ubjects, fall under this cen&s;ure. Their love &s;onnets, and pa&s;toral ver&s;es, are far from wanting their beauties; but a great deal of the&s;e depend upon a certain <HI>curio&s;a felicitas</HI> of expre&s;&s;ion in the original; &s;o that they would appear greatly to their di&s;advantage in another language. What the modern bards are mo&s;t in&s;upportable in, are their nau&s;eous panegyrics upon their patrons. We &s;ee, in them, a petty ty|rant, who&s;e name was never heard, be|yond the contracted limits of his own valley, &s;talking forth in all the trappings of a fini&s;hed hero. From their frequent al|lu&s;ions, however, to the entertainments which he gave, and the <HI>&s;trength of his cups,</HI> we may ea&s;ily gue&s;s from whence proceeded the prai&s;e of an indolent and effeminate race of men: for the bards, from the great court paid, originally, to their or|der, became, at la&s;t, the mo&s;t flagitious and di&s;pirited of all mortals. Their compo|&s;itions, therefore, on this &s;ide of a certain period, are dull and trivial to the highe&s;t degree. By lavi&s;hing their prai&s;es upon unworthy objects, their panegyricks be|came common and little regarded; they were thru&s;t out of the hou&s;es of the chiefs, and wandered about, from tribe to tribe, in the double capacity of poet and harper. Galled with this u&s;age, they betook them|&s;elves to &s;atire and lampoon, &s;o that the compo&s;itions of the bards, for more than a c$ntury back, are almo&s;t altogether of the &s;arca&s;tical kind. In this they &s;uc|ceeded well; for, as there is no language more copious than the Gali$, &s;o there is &s;carcely any equally adapted to tho&s;e quaint turns of expre&s;&s;ion which belong to &s;atire.&mdash;Tho' the chiefs di&s;regarded the lam|poons of the bards, the vulgar, out of mere fear, received them into their habitations, entertained them, as well as their circum&s;tances would allow, and kept exi&s;ting, for &s;ome years, an order, which, by their own mi&s;management, had de&s;erv|edly fallen into contempt.</P>

Cathmor, &s;trike the &s;hield, that joy may return to my darkened

YOUNG branch of green-headed Lumon, why do&s;t thou &s;hake
in the &s;torm? Often has Cathmor returned, from darkly-rolling
wars. The darts of death are but hail to me; they have often
bounded from my &s;hield. I have ri&s;en brightened from battle,
like a meteor from a &s;tormy cloud. Return not, fair beam, from
thy vale, when the roar of battle grows. Then might the foe
e&s;cape, as from my fathers of old.</P>
<P>THEY told to Son-mor<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">S&oacute;n-mor, <HI>tall hand&s;ome man.</HI> He was the father of Borbar-duthul, chief of Atha, and grandfather to Cathmor him&s;elf. The propriety of this epi&s;ode is evident. But, tho' it appears here to be only introduced as an example to Sul-mulla; the poet pro|bably had another de&s;ign in view, which was further to illu&s;trate the antiquity of the quarrel between the Firbolg and Ca&euml;l.</NOTE>, of Clunar<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cluan-er, <HI>man of the field.</HI> This chief was killed in battle by Cormac Mac-Conar, king of Ireland, the father of Ro&s;|crana, the fir&s;t wife of Fingal.

ought to be poured upon the warrior's tomb.</P>
<P>NOR ro&s;e the rage of Son-mor, but his days were &s;ilent and
dark. Sul-allin wandered, by her grey &s;treams, with her tearful
eyes. Often did &s;he look, on the hero, when he was folded in his
thoughts. But &s;he &s;hrunk from his eyes, and turned her lone &s;teps
away.&mdash;Battles ro&s;e, like a tempe&s;t, and drove the mi&s;t from his

<P><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The poet returns to his &s;ubject. The de&s;cription of the &s;hield of Cathmor is va|luable, on account of the light it throws on the progre&s;s of arts in tho&s;e early times. Tho&s;e who draw their ideas of remote an|tiquity from their ob&s;ervations on the man|ners of modern &s;avage nations, will have no high opinion of the workman&s;hip of Cathmor's &s;hield. To remove &s;ome part of their prejudice, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the Belgae of Britain, who were the ance&s;tors of the Firbolg, were a commercial people; and commerce, we might prove, from many &s;hining examples of our own times, is the proper inlet of arts and &s;ciences, and all that exalts the human mind.

<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>THE fourth morning, from the opening of the poem, comes on. Fingal, &s;till con|tinuing
in the place, to which he had retired on the preceding night, is &s;een, at
intervals, thro' the mi&s;t, which covered the rock of Cormul. The de&s;cent of
the king is de&s;cribed. He orders Gaul, Dermid, and Carril the bard, to go
to the val$ey of Cluna, and conduct, from thence, to the Caledonian army,
Ferad artho, the &s;on of Cairbre, the only per&s;on remaining of the family of
Conar, the fir&s;t king of Ireland.&mdash;The king takes the command of the army, and
prepares for battle. Marching towards the enemy, he comes to the cave of Lubar,
where the body of Fillan lay. Upon &s;eeing his dog Bran, who lay at the entrance
of the cave, his grief returns.&mdash;Cathmor arranges the Iri&s;h army in order of
battle. The appearance of that hero. The general conflict is de&s;cribed. The
actions of Fingal and Cathmor. A &s;torm. The total rout of the Fir-bolg. The
two kings engage, in a column of mi&s;t, on the banks of Lubar. Their attitude
and conference after the combat. The death of Cathmor.&mdash;Fingal re&s;igns <HI>the &s;pear
of Trenmor</HI> to O&s;&s;ian. The ceremonies ob&s;erved on that occa&s;ion.&mdash;The &s;pirit of
Cathmor, in the mean time, appears to Sul-malla, in the valley of Lona. Her
&s;orrow.&mdash;Evening comes on. A fea&s;t is prepared.&mdash;The coming of Ferad-artho is
announced by the &s;ongs of a hundred bards.&mdash;The poem clo&s;es, with a &s;peech of
Fingal.</Q>

<P><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>In the cour&s;e of my notes, I have made it more my bu&s;ine&s;s to explain, than to examine, critically, the works of O&s;&s;ian. The fir&s;t is my province, as the per&s;on be&s;t acquainted with them, the &s;econd falls to the &s;hare of others. I &s;hall, however, ob|&s;erve, that all the precepts, which Ari&s;totle drew from Homer, ought not to be applied to the compo&s;ition of a Celtic bard; nor ought the title of the latter to the <HI>epopaea</HI> to be di&s;puted, even if he &s;hould differ, in &s;ome circum&s;tances, from a Greek poet.&mdash;Some allowance &s;hould be made for the different manners of nations. The genius of the Greeks and Celtae was extremely di&s;&s;imilar. The fir&s;t were lively and lo|quacious; a manly conci&s;ene&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion di&s;tingui&s;hed the latter. We find, accord|ingly, that the compo&s;itions of Homer and O&s;&s;ian are marked with the general and oppo&s;ite characters of their re&s;pective na|tions, and, con&s;equently, it is improper to compare the <HI>minutiae</HI> of their poems toge|ther. There are, however, general rules, in the conduct of an epic poem, which, as they are natural, are, likewi&s;e, uni|ver&s;al. In the&s;e the two poets exactly cor|re&s;pond. This &s;imilarity, which could not po&s;&s;ibly proceed from imitation, is more deci&s;ive, with re&s;pect to the grand e&s;&s;entials of the <HI>epopaea,</HI> than all the precepts of Ari&s;totle.</P>
<P>O&s;&s;ian is now approaching to the grand cata&s;trophe. The preparations he has made, in the preceding book, properly introduce the magnificence of de&s;cription, with which the pre&s;ent book opens, and tend to &s;hew that the Celtic bard had more art, in work|ing up his fable, than &s;ome of tho&s;e, who clo&s;ely imitated the perfect model of Ho|mer. The tran&s;ition from the pathetic to the &s;ublime is ea&s;y and natural. Till the mind is opened, by the fir&s;t, it &s;carcely can have an adequate comprehen&s;ion of the &s;econd. The &s;oft and affecting &s;cenes of the &s;eventh book form a &s;ort of contra&s;t to, and con&s;equently heighten, the features of the more grand and terrible images of the eighth.</P>
<P>The &s;imile, with which this book opens, is, perhaps, the longe&s;t, and the mo&s;t mi|nutely de&s;criptive, of any in the works of O&s;&s;ian. The images of it are only fami|liar to tho&s;e who live in a cold and moun|tainous country. They have often &s;een a lake &s;uddenly frozen over, and &s;trewed with withered gra&s;s, and boughs torn, by winds, from the mountains, which form its banks; but, I believe, few of them would be of the mind of the ancient bard, who pre|ferred the&s;e winter-&s;cenes to the irriguous vales of May.&mdash;<HI>To me,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>bring back my woods, which &s;trew their leaves on bla&s;ts: &s;pread the lake below, with all its frozen waves. Plea&s;ant is the breeze on the bearded ice; when the moon is broad in heaven, and the &s;pirit of the mountain roars. Roll away the green vales of May; they are thoughts of maids,</HI> &amp;c. Such are the words of this winter poet, but what he afterwards adds, gives us to under&s;tand, that tho&s;e frigid &s;cenes were not his &s;ole delight: for he &s;peaks, with great tenderne&s;s, of the <HI>oak-lighted hall of the chief;</HI> and the <HI>&s;trength of the &s;hells, at night, when the cour&s;e of winds is abroad.</HI></P>
<P>If the &s;imile of a frozen lake aptly il|lu&s;trates the &s;tillne&s;s and &s;ilent expectation of an army, lying under arms, waiting for the coming of their king, &s;o the compa|ri&s;on of the &s;udden ri&s;ing of waves, a|round a &s;pirit, is al&s;o very expre&s;&s;ive of the tumultuous joy of Fingal's army, upon the appearance of that hero.&mdash;An ancient bard, &s;en&s;ible of the beauty of this pa&s;&s;age, has happily imitated it, in a poem, concerning Kenneth Mac$Alpin, king of Scotland.&mdash;I had occa&s;ion to quote this piece, in a note in the preceding book. Kenneth had retired privately, by night, to a hill, in the neighbourhood of his army, and, upon his return, next morning, the bard &s;ays, <HI>that he was like the form of a &s;pirit, returning to his &s;ecret bay. In the &s;kirt of a bla&s;t he &s;tands. The waves lift their roaring heads. Their green backs are quivering round. Rocks eccho back their joy.</HI></P></NOTE> AS when the wintry winds have &s;eized the waves of the
mountain-lake, have &s;eized them, in &s;tormy night, and
cloathed them over with ice; white, to the hunter's early eye,
the billows &s;till &s;eem to roll. He turns his ear to the &s;ound of
each unequal ridge. But each is &s;ilent, gleaming, &s;trewn with
<PB N="138" REF="173">
boughs and tu&s;ts of gra&s;s, which &s;hake and whi&s;tle to the wind,
over their grey &s;eats of fro&s;t.&mdash;So &s;ilent &s;hone to the morning the ridges of Morven's ho&s;t, as each warrior looked up from his helmet to|wards
<PB N="139" REF="174">
the hill of the king; the cloud-covered hill of Fingal,
where he &s;trode, in the folds of mi&s;t. At times is the hero &s;een,
greatly dim in all his arms. From thought to thought rolled the
war, along his mighty &s;oul.</P>
<P>Now is the coming forth of the king.&mdash;Fir&s;t appeared the &s;word
of Luno; the &s;pear half i&s;&s;uing from a cloud, the &s;hield &s;till dim
in mi&s;t. But when the &s;tride of the king came abroad, with all
his grey, dewy locks in the wind; then ro&s;e the &s;houts of his ho&s;t
over every moving tribe. They gathered, gleaming, round, with
all their echoing &s;hields. So ri&s;e the green &s;eas round a &s;pirit, that
comes down from the &s;qually wind. The traveller hears the &s;ound
afar, and li&s;ts his head over the rock. He looks on the troubled
bay, and thinks he dimly &s;ees the form. The waves &s;port, un|wieldy,

his locks of youth, is Ferad-artho<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ferad-artho was the &s;on of Cairbar Mac-Cormac king of Ireland. He was the only one remaining of the race of Conar, the &s;on of Trenmor, the fir&s;t Iri&s;h mo|narch, according to O&s;&s;ian. In order to make this pa&s;&s;age thoroughly under&s;tood, it may not be improper to recapitulate &s;ome part of what has been &s;aid in preceding notes.&mdash;Upon the death of Conar the &s;on of Trenmor, his &s;on Cormac &s;ucceeded on the Iri&s;h throne. Cormac reigned long. His children were, Cairbar, who &s;ucceed|ed him, and Ros-crana, the fir&s;t wife of Fingal. Cairbar, long before the death of his father Cormac, had taken to wife Bos|gala, the daughter of Colgar, one of the mo&s;t powerful chiefs in Connaught, and had, by her, Artho, afterwards king of Ireland. Soon after Artho arrived at man's e&s;tate, his mother Bos-gala died, and Cair|bar married Beltanno, the daughter of Conachar of Ullin, who brought him a &s;on, whom he called Ferad-artho, i. e. <HI>a man in the place of Artho.</HI> The occa&s;ion of the name was this. Artho, when his brother was born, was ab&s;ent, on an ex|pedition, in the &s;outh of Ireland. A fal&s;e report was brought to his father, that he was killed.&mdash;<HI>Cairbar,</HI> to u&s;e the words of the poem on the &s;ubject, <HI>darkened for his fair-haired &s;on. He turned to the young beam of light, the &s;on of Beltanno of Co|nachar. Thou &s;halt be Ferad-artho, he &s;aid, a fire before thy race.</HI> Cairbar, &s;oon after, died, nor did Artho long &s;urvive him. Artho was &s;ucceeded, in the Iri&s;h throne, by his &s;on Cormac, who, in his minority, was murdered by Cairbar, the &s;on of Bor|bar-duthul.&mdash;Ferad-artho, &s;ays tradition, was very young, when the expedition of Fingal, to &s;ettle him on the throne of Ire|land, happened. During the &s;hort reign of young Cormac, Ferad-artho lived at the royal palace of Temora. Upon the murder of the king, Condan, the bard, conveyed Ferad-artho, privately, to the cave of Cluna, behind the mountain Crommal, in Ul&s;ter, where they both lived concealed, during the u&s;urpation of the family of Atha. All the&s;e particulars, concerning Ferad-artho, may be gathered from the compo&s;itions of O&s;&s;ian: A bard, le&s;s ancient, has delivered the whole hi&s;|tory, in a poem ju&s;t now in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion. It has little merit, if we except the &s;cene between Ferad-artho, and the me&s;&s;engers of Fingal, upon their arrival, in the valley of Cluna. After hearing of the great actions of Fingal, the young prince propo&s;es the following que&s;tions concerning him, to Gaul and Dermid.&mdash;&startq;Is the king tall as the rock of my cave? Is his &s;pear a $ir of Cluna?

There are many ex|travagant fictions founded, upon the cir|cum&s;tance of Fingal leaping at once over the river Lubar. Many of them are hand|ed down in tradition. The Iri&s;h compo&s;i|tions concerning Fingal invariably &s;peak of him as a giant. Of the&s;e Hibernian poems there are now many in my hands. From the language, and allu&s;ions to the times in which they were writ, I &s;hould fix the date of their compo&s;ition in the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth centuries. In &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, the poetry is far from wanting merit, but the fable is unnatural, and the whole conduct of the pieces injudicious. I &s;hall give one in&s;tance of the extravagant fictions of the Iri&s;h bards, in a poem which they, mo&s;t unju&s;tly, a&s;cribe to O&s;&s;ian. The &s;tory of it is this:&mdash;Ireland being threatened with an inva&s;ion from &s;ome part of Scandinavia, Fingal &s;ent O&s;&s;ian, O&s;car and Ca-olt, to watch the bay, in which, it was expected, the enemy was to land. O&s;car, unluckily, fell a&s;leep, before the Scandinavians appear|ed; and, great as he was, &s;ays the Iri&s;h bard, he had one bad property, that no le&s;s could waken him, before his time, than cutting off one of his fingers, or throwing a great &s;tone again&s;t his head; and it was dangerous to come near him on tho&s;e occa|&s;ions, till he had recovered him&s;elf, and was fully awake. Ca-olt, who was em|ployed by O&s;&s;ian to waken his &s;on, made choice of throwing the &s;tone again&s;t his head, as the lea&s;t dangerous expedient. The &s;tone, rebounding from the hero's head, &s;hook, as it rolled along, the hill for three miles round. O&s;car ro&s;e in rage, &s;ought bravely, and, &s;ingly, vanqui&s;hed a wing of the enemy's army.&mdash;Thus the bard goes on, till Fingal put an end to the war, by the total rout of the Scandinavians. Puerile, and even de&s;picable, as the&s;e fictions are, yet Keating and O'Flaherty have no better authority than the poems which contain them, for all that they write concerning Fion Mac-comnal, and the pretended mi|litia of Ireland.</NOTE> on his &s;pear, over

<P>The re&s;t of the poem is lo&s;t; from the &s;tory of it, which is &s;till pre&s;erved, we under&s;tand, that Sul-malla returned to her own country.

To this it may be an&s;wered, that Fingal was but very young [book 4th] when he took to wi&s;e Ros-crana, who &s;oon after became the mother of O&s;&s;ian. O&s;&s;ian was al&s;o extremely young when he married Ever-allin, the mother of O&s;car.

O&s;|car, perhaps, might be about twenty, when he was killed, in the battle of Gabhra, [book 1&s;t] &s;o the age of Fingal, when the deci&s;ive battle was fought between him and Cathmor, was ju&s;t fifty-&s;ix years.

<P><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The expedition of O&s;&s;ian to Inis|huna happened a &s;hort time before Fingal pa&s;&s;ed over into Ireland, to dethrone Cair|bar the &s;on of Borbar-duthul. Cathmor, the brother of Cairbar, was aiding Con|mor, king of Inis-huna, in his wars, at the time that O&s;&s;ian defeated Duth-carmor, in the valley of Rath-col. The poem is more intere&s;ting, that it contains &s;o many particulars concerning tho&s;e per|&s;onages, who make &s;o great a figure in Temora.</P>
<P>The exact corre&s;pondence in the man|ners and cu&s;toms of Inis-huna, as here de|&s;cribed, to tho&s;e of Caledonia, leaves no room to doubt, that the inhabitants of both were originally the &s;ame people. Some may alledge, that O&s;&s;ian might transfer, in his poetical de&s;criptions, the manners of his own nation to foreigners. This objec|tion is ea&s;ily an&s;wered. Why has he not done this with regard to the inhabitants of Scandinavia?&mdash;We find the latter very different in their cu&s;toms and &s;uper&s;titions from the nations of Britain and Ireland. The Scandinavian manners are remark|ably barbarous and fierce, and &s;eem to mark out a nation much le&s;s advanced in a &s;tate of civilization, than the inhabitants of Britain were in the times of O&s;&s;ian.</P></NOTE> WHO moves &s;o &s;tately, on Lumon, at the roar of the

the hands of Sul-malla, on the trembling &s;trings. Half-heard,

In &s;tates, where luxury has been long e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, I am told, that beauty of per&s;on is, by no means, the characteri&s;tic of an|tiquity of family. This mu&s;t be attribut|ed to tho&s;e enervating vices, which are in|&s;eparable from luxury and wealth. A great family, (to alter a little the words of the hi&s;torian) it is true, like a river, becomes con&s;iderable from the length of its cour&s;e, but, as it rolls on, hereditary di&s;tempers, as well as property, &s;low &s;ucce&s;&s;ively into it.&endq;</NOTE>.&mdash;Not unknown, I &s;aid, at his &s;treams is he, the father

<Q>Fingal, in one of his voyages to the Orkney i&s;lands, was driven, by &s;tre&s;s of weather,
into a bay of Scandinavia, near the re&s;idence of Starno, king of Lochlin. Starno
invites Fingal to a fea&s;t. Fingal, doubting the faith of the king, and mindful of his
former breach of ho&s;pitality, [Fingal, b. 3.] refu&s;es to go.&mdash;Starno gathers toge|ther
his tribes: Fingal re&s;olves to defend him&s;elf.&mdash;Night coming on, Duth-ma|runo
propo&s;es to Fingal, to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy.&mdash;The king him&s;elf
undertakes the watch. Advancing towards the enemy, he, accidentally, comes to
the cave of Turthor, where Starno had confined Conban-carglas, the captive daugh|ter
of a neighbouring chief.&mdash;Her &s;tory is imperfect, a part of the original being
lo&s;t.&mdash;Fingal comes to a place of wor&s;hip, where Starno and his &s;on, Swaran, con|&s;ulted
the &s;pirit of Loda, concerning the i&s;&s;ue of the war.&mdash;The rencounter of Fin|gal
and Swaran.&mdash;The <HI>du&auml;n</HI> concludes, with a de&s;cription of the airy hall of Cruth|loda

Two years after he took to wife Ros-crana, the daughter of Cormac, king of Ireland, Fingal undertook an expedition into Orkney, to vi&s;it his friend Cathulla, king of Ini&s;tore. After &s;taying a few days at Carric-thura, the re&s;idence of Cathulla, the king &s;et &s;ail, to return to Scotland; but, a violent &s;torm ari&s;ing, his &s;hips were driven into a bay of Scandinavia, near Gormal, the &s;eat of Starno, king of Lochlin, his avowed enemy. Starno, upon the appear|ance of &s;trangers on his coa&s;t, &s;ummoned together the neighbouring tribes, and ad|vanced, in a ho&s;tile manner, towards the bay of U-thorno, where Fingal had taken &s;helter. Upon di&s;covering who the &s;tran|gers were, and fearing the valour of Fin|gal, which he had, more than once, expe|rienced before, he re&s;olved to accompli&s;h by treachery, what he was afraid he &s;hould fail in by open force. He invited, there|fore, Fingal to a fea&s;t, at which he in|tended to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. The king pru|dently declined to go, and Starno betook him&s;elf to arms.&mdash;The &s;equel of the &s;tory may be learned from the poem it&s;elf.</NOTE> FIRST.</HEAD>

He became after|wards famous, in the expeditions of O&s;&s;ian, after the death of Fingal. The tradition|al tales concerning him are very numerous, and, from the epithet, in them, be&s;towed on him <HI>(Candona of boars)</HI> it would ap|pear, that he applied him&s;elf to that kind of hunting, which his father, in this para|graph, is &s;o anxious to recommend to him. As I have mentioned the traditional tales of the Highlands, it may not be improper here, to give &s;ome account of them. Af|ter the expul&s;ion of the bards, from the hou&s;es of the chiefs, they, being an indo|lent race of men, owed all their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the genero&s;ity of the vulgar, whom they diverted with repeating the compo&s;itions of their predece&s;&s;ors, and running up the ge|nealogies of their entertainers to the family of their chiefs. As this &s;ubject was, how|ever, &s;oon exhau&s;ted, they were obliged to have recour&s;e to invention, and form &s;tories having no foundation in fact which were &s;wallowed, with great credulity, by an ig|norant multitude. By frequent repeating, the fable grew upon their hands, and, as each threw in whatever circum&s;tance he thought conducive to rai&s;e the admiration of his hearers, the &s;tory became, at la&s;t, &s;o devoid of all probability, that even the vulgar them&s;elves did not believe it. They, however, liked the tales &s;o well, that the bards found their advantage in turning pro|fe&s;&s;ed tale-makers. They then launch|ed out into the wilde&s;t regions of fiction and romance. I firmly believe, there are more &s;tories of giants, enchanted ca&s;tles, dwarfs, and palfreys, in the Highlands, than in any country in Europe. The&s;e tales, it is certain, like other romantic compo&s;itions, have many things in them unnatural, and, con&s;equently, di&s;gu&s;tful to true ta&s;te, but, I know not how it happens, they command attention more than any other fictions I ever met with.&mdash;The extream length of the&s;e pieces is very &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;ome of them requiring many days to repeat them, but &s;uch hold they take of the memory, that few circum&s;tances are ever omitted by tho&s;e who have received them only from oral tra|dition: What is &s;till more amazing, the very language of the bards is &s;till pre&s;erved. It is curious to &s;ee, that the de&s;criptions of magnificence, introduced in the&s;e tales, is even &s;uperior to all the pompous oriental fictions of the kind.</NOTE>, tell him of his father's joy, when the

<P>TORCUL-TORNO<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Torcul-torno, according to tradition, was king of Crathlun, a di&s;trict in Sweden. The river Lulan ran near the re&s;idence of Torcul-torno. There is a river in Sweden, &s;till called Lula, which is probably the &s;ame with Lulan. The war between Starno and Torcul-torno, which terminated in the death of the latter, had its ri&s;e at a hunting party. Starno being invited, in a friendly manner, by Torcul-torno, both kings, with their followers, went to the mountains of Stiva|mor, to hunt. A boar ru&s;hed from the wood before the kings, and Torcul-torno killed it. Starno thought this behaviour a breach upon the privilege of gue&s;ts, who were always <HI>honoured,</HI> as tradition expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>with the danger of the chace.</HI> A quarrel aro&s;e, the kings came to battle, with all their attendants, and the party of Torcul|torno were totally defeated, and he him&s;elf &s;lain. Starno pur&s;ued his victory, laid wa&s;te the di&s;trict of Crathlun, and, coming to the re&s;idence of Torcul-torno, carried off, by force, Conban-carglas, the beauti|ful daughter of his enemy.

<P>NEAR us are the foes, Duth-maruno. They come forward,
like waves in mi&s;t, when their foamy tops are &s;een, at times, above
the low-&s;ailing vapour.&mdash;The traveller &s;hrinks on his journey, and

&s;hall a warrior lead?</P>
<P><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In this &s;hort epi&s;ode we have a very probable account given us, of the origin of monarchy in Caledonia. The <HI>Ca&euml;l,</HI> or Gauls, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the countries to the north of the Firth of Edinburgh, were, originally, a number of di&s;tinct tribes, or clans, each-&s;ubject to its own chief, who was free and independent of any other power. When the Romans invaded them, the common danger might, perhaps, have induced tho&s;e <HI>reguli</HI> to join together, but, as they were unwilling to yield to the com|mand of one of their own number, their battles were ill-conducted, and, con&s;e|quently, un&s;ucce&s;sful.&mdash;Trenmor was the fir&s;t who repre&s;ented to the chiefs, the bad con&s;equences of carrying on their wars in this irregular manner, and advi&s;ed, that they them&s;elves &s;hould alternately lead in battle. They did &s;o, but they were un&s;uc|ce&s;sful. When it came to Trenmor's turn, he totally defeated the enemy, by his &s;upe|rior valour and conduct, which gained him &s;uch an intere&s;t among the tribes, that he, and his family after him, were regarded as kings; or, to u&s;e the poet's expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>the words of power ru&s;hed forth from Selma of kings.</HI>&mdash;The regal authority, however, ex|cept in time of war, was but incon&s;ider|able; for every chief, within his own di&s;|trict, was ab&s;olute and independent.&mdash;From the &s;cene of the battle in this epi&s;ode, (which was in the valley of Crona, a little to the north of Ag$icola's wall) I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that the enemies of the Caledoni|ans were the Romans, or provincial Britons.</NOTE> THE deeds of old, &s;aid Duth-maruno, are like paths to our
eyes, O Fingal. Broad-&s;hielded Trenmor, is &s;till &s;een, amid&s;t his
own dim years. Nor feeble was the &s;oul of the king. There, no
dark deed wandered in &s;ecret.&mdash;From their hundred &s;treams came
the tribes, to gra&s;&s;y Colglan-crona. Their chiefs were before them.
Each &s;trove to lead the war. Their &s;words were often half-un|&s;heathed.
Red rolled their eyes of rage. Separate they &s;tood,
and hummed, their &s;urly &s;ongs.&mdash;&startq;Why &s;hould they yield to
each other? their fathers were equal in war.&endq;</P>
<P>TRENMOR was there, with his people, &s;tately in youthful locks.
He &s;aw the advancing foe. The grief of his &s;oul aro&s;e. He bade
<PB N="195" REF="228">
the chiefs to lead, by turns: they led, but they were rolled away.
&mdash;From his own mo&s;&s;y hill, blue-&s;hielded Trenmor came down.
He led wide-&s;kirted battle, and the &s;trangers failed.&mdash;Around him
the dark-browed warriors came: they &s;truck the &s;hield of joy.
Like a plea&s;ant gale, the words of power ru&s;hed forth from Selma
of kings. But the chiefs led, by turns, in war, till mighty danger
ro&s;e: then was the hour of the king to conquer in the field.</P>
<P>&startq;NOT unknown, &s;aid Cromma-glas<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In tradition, this Cromma-glas makes a great figure in that battle which Comhal lo&s;t, together with his life, to the tribe of Morni. I have ju&s;t now, in my hands, an Iri&s;h compo&s;ition, of a very modern date, as appears from the language, in which all the traditions, concerning that deci&s;ive en|gagement, are jumbled together. In ju&s;|tice to the merit of the poem, I &s;hould have here pre&s;ented to the reader a tran&s;la|tion of it, did not the bard mention &s;ome circum&s;tances very ridiculous, and others altogether indecent. Morna, the wife of Comhal, had a principal hand in all the tran&s;actions previous to the defeat and death of her hu&s;band; &s;he, to u&s;e the words of the bard, <HI>who was the guiding &s;tar of the women of Erin.</HI> The bard, it is to be hoped, mi&s;repre&s;ented the ladies of his country, for Morna's behaviour was, according to him, &s;o void of all decency and vir|tue, that it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, they had cho&s;en her for their <HI>guiding &s;tar.</HI>&mdash;The poem con&s;i&s;ts of many &s;tanzas. The lan|guage is figurative, and the numbers har|monious; but the piece is &s;o full of ana|chroni&s;ms, and &s;o unequal in its com|po&s;ition, that the author, mo&s;t undoubt|edly, was either mad; or drunk, when he wrote it.&mdash;It is worthy of being re|marked, that Comhal is, in this poem, very often called, <HI>Comhal na h'Albin,</HI> or <HI>Comhal of Albion,</HI> which &s;ufficiently demon|&s;trates, that the allegations of Keating and O Flaherty, concerning <HI>Fion Mac-Comnal,</HI> are but of late invention.</NOTE> of &s;hields, are the deeds
of our fathers.&mdash;But who &s;hall now lead the war, before the race
of kings? Mi&s;t &s;ettles on the&s;e four dark hills: within it let each
warrior &s;trike his &s;hield. Spirits may de&s;cend in darkne&s;s, and mark
us for the war.&endq;&mdash;They went, each to his hill of mi&s;t. Bards
marked the &s;ounds of the &s;hields. Loude&s;t rung thy bo&s;s, Duth|maruno.
Thou mu&s;t lead in war.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="229">
LIKE the murmur of waters, the race of U-thorno came down.
Starno led the battle, and Swaran of &s;tormy i&s;les. They looked
forward from iron &s;hields, like Cruth-loda fiery-eyed, when he
looks from behind the darkened moon, and &s;trews his &s;igns on
night.</P>
<P>THE foes met by Turthor's &s;tream. They heaved like ridgy
waves. Their echoing &s;trokes are mixed. Shadowy death flies
over the ho&s;ts. They were clouds of hail, with &s;qually winds in
their &s;kirts. Their &s;howers are roaring together. Below them
&s;wells the dark-rolling deep.</P>
<P>STRIFE of gloomy U-thorno, why &s;hould I mark thy wounds?
Thou art with the years that are gone; thou fade&s;t on my &s;oul.
Starno brought forward his &s;kirt of war, and Swaran his own dark
wing. Nor a harmle&s;s fire is Duth-maruno's &s;word.&mdash;Lochlin is
rolled over her &s;treams. The wrathful kings are folded in thoughts.
They roll their &s;ilent eyes, over the flight of their land.&mdash;The horn
of Fingal was heard; the &s;ons of woody Albion returned. But
many lay, by Turthor's &s;tream, &s;ilent in their blood.</P>
<P>CHIEF of Crom-charn, &s;aid the king, Duth-maruno, hunter of

One of the tale makers of the north has cho&s;en for his hero, Starn|mor, the father of Duth-maruno, and, con&s;idering the adventures thro' which he has led him, the piece is neither di&s;agree|able, nor abounding with that kind of fic|tion, which &s;hocks credibility.</NOTE>, replied the chief, was the fir&s;t of my race in Al|bion;

forth, in their years; they came forth to war, but they always fell.
The wound of my fathers is mine, king of echoing i&s;les!</P>
<P>HE drew an arrow from his &s;ide. He fell pale, in a land un|known.
His &s;oul came forth to his fathers, to their &s;tormy i&s;le.
There they pur&s;ued boars of mi&s;t, along the &s;kirts of winds.&mdash;The
chiefs &s;tood &s;ilent around, as the &s;tones of Loda, on their hill.
The traveller &s;ees them, thro' the twilight, from his lonely path.
He thinks them the gho&s;ts of the aged, forming future wars.</P>
<P>NIGHT came down, on U-thorno. Still &s;tood the chiefs in their
grief. The bla&s;t hi&s;&s;ed, by turns, thro' every warrior's hair.&mdash;Fin|gal,
at length, bur&s;ted forth from the thoughts of his &s;oul. He
called Ullin of harps, and bade the &s;ong to ri&s;e.&mdash;No falling fire,

Their interpolations are &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the genuine remains of O&s;&s;ian, that it took me very little time to mark them out, and totally to reject them. If the modern Scotch and Iri&s;h bards have &s;hewn any judgment, it is in a&s;cribing their own compo&s;itions to names of antiquity, for, by that means, they them&s;elves have e&s;caped that contempt, which the authors of &s;uch futile perform|ances mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, have met with, from people of true ta&s;te.&mdash;I was led into this ob&s;ervation, by an Iri&s;h poem, ju&s;t now before me. It concerns a de&s;cent made by Swaran, king of Lochlin, on Ireland, and is the work, &s;ays the traditional preface prefixed to it, of <HI>O&s;&s;ian Mac-Fion.</HI> It however appears, from &s;everal pious ejacu|lations, that it was rather the compo&s;ition of &s;ome good prie&s;t, in the fifteenth or &s;ix|teenth century, for he &s;peaks, with great devotion, of pilgrimage, and more particu|larly, of the <HI>blue-eyed daughters of the con|vent.</HI> Religious, however, as this poet was, he was not altogether decent, in the &s;cenes he introduces between Swaran and the wife of <HI>Congcullion,</HI> both of whom he repre&s;ents as giants. It happening unfor|tunately, that <HI>Congcullion</HI> was only of a moderate &s;tature, his wife, without he&s;ita|tion, preferred Swaran, as a more adequate match for her own gigantic &s;ize. From this fatal preference proceeded &s;o much mi&s;chief, that the good poet altogether lo&s;t &s;ight of his principal action, and he ends the piece, with an advice to men, in the choice of their wives, which, however good it may be, I &s;hall leave concealed in the ob&s;curity of the original.</NOTE> UTHORNO, hill of &s;torms, I behold my race on thy &s;ide.

My cour&s;e was towards the i&s;le of Fu&auml;rfed, woody dweller of &s;eas.
Fingal had &s;ent me to the aid of Mal-orchol, king of Fu&auml;rfed wild:

<P>IN Col-coiled, I bound my &s;ails, and &s;ent my &s;word to Mal|orchol

<P>I COME not, I &s;aid, to look, like a boy, on the &s;trife. Fingal

She waked her own &s;ad tale, from every trembling &s;tring. I &s;tood

Her eyes were like two &s;tars, looking forward thro' a ru&s;hing &s;hower.
The mariner marks them on high, and ble&s;&s;es the lovely beams.&mdash;With
morning we ru&s;hed to battle, to Tormul's re&s;ounding &s;tream:
the foe moved to the &s;ound of Ton-thormod's bo&s;&s;y &s;hield. From
wing to wing the &s;trife was mixed. I met the chief of Sar-dronlo.
Wide flew his broken &s;teel. I &s;eized the king in fight. I gave his
hand, bound fa&s;t with thongs, to Mal-orchol, the giver of &s;hells.
Joy ro&s;e at the fea&s;t of Fu&auml;rfed, for the foe had failed.&mdash;Ton|thormod

the book&s;eller's hands, for the in&s;pection of the curious. Tho'
the erroneous orthography of the bards is departed from, in ma|ny
in&s;tances, in the following &s;pecimen, yet &s;everal quie&s;cent con|&s;onants
are retained, to &s;hew the derivation of the words. This
circum&s;tance may give an uncouth appearance to the language,
in the eyes of tho&s;e who are &s;trangers to its harmony. They
ought, however, to con&s;ider, that a language is put to the &s;e|vere&s;t
te&s;t, when it is &s;tripped of its own proper characters; e&s;|pecially,
when the power of <HI>one</HI> of them requires, &s;ometimes,
a combination of two or three Roman letters to expre&s;s it.</P>
