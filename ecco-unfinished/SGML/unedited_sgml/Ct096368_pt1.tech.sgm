<P>THOUGH the &s;ources, from which the following
Papers have been drawn, are explained in the Intro|duction,
it may not be improper to premi&s;e &s;ome facts for
the reader's more immediate information. The&s;e volumes
contain the papers of the family of Stuart and tho&s;e of the
hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick Lunenburgh. The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;t of the
collection of Mr. Nairne, who was under-&s;ecretary, from the
Revolution to the end of the year 1713, to the mini&s;ters of
King James the Second, and to tho&s;e of his &s;on. The latter
comprehend the material part of the corre&s;pondence and
&s;ecret negotiations of the hou&s;e of Hannover, their agents
and their friends in Britain, throughout the reign of
Queen Anne. The extracts from the life of King James
the Second, con&s;i&s;ting of more than thirty &s;heets of print,
were partly taken by the late Mr. Thomas Carte, and
partly by the Editor, in a journey he made for that pur|po&s;e
to France. Mr. Nairne's papers came into the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Mr. Carte, &s;ome time before his death. To
the&s;e, the Editor, who had free acce&s;s to &s;uch manu|&s;cripts
as lie open in the Scotch College at Paris, hath
added many valuable acqui&s;itions of his own. The
ORIGINALS are now in the hands of the book&s;eller.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE greate&s;t part of mankind form their political opinions on
the u&s;ages of pa&s;t times. With an excu&s;able reverence for their
ance&s;tors, they &s;uffer rights derived from Nature to be decided by
precedent; and among many nations in Europe, the habit of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to
arbitrary power is a &s;ufficient argument for &s;lavery. In this country
the &s;upporters of the freedom of the people, and tho&s;e who favour the
high prerogatives of the crown, make equally their appeal to antiquity,
and, with a kind of mutual con&s;ent, re&s;t the ju&s;tice of their re&s;pec|tive
claims on the authority of former ages. Nothing, however, is more
ridiculous, than to &s;uppo&s;e that freedom can be received as a legacy; or
that abject progenitors have any right to entail &s;lavery on their po|&s;terity.</P>
<P>This maxim, however, has &s;eldom any weight with the great body of a
nation. The truth is, men are more &s;afe in re&s;ting their claims on prece|dents,
than in recurring perpetually to fir&s;t principles. The authority of
facts is obvious, and under&s;tood by all. But few are capable of compre|hending
that manly philo&s;ophy, which deems every government unju&s;t
that is not free. To a&s;certain, therefore, the genuine circum&s;tances of
former tran&s;actions; to redeem hi&s;tory from the mi&s;repre&s;entations of the
de&s;igning, the errors of the ignorant, and the weakne&s;s of the prejudiced;
to give to characters their genuine colour; to &s;hew mankind, without
either fear or favour, as they were, is certainly de&s;erving well of a people
who mea&s;ure their public happine&s;s and their political mi&s;ery by the
&s;tandard of other times.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12">
The mo&s;t free nations have oftener derived their liberty from accident,
than from a &s;en&s;e of the ju&s;tice, which mankind owe to them&s;elves. The
people of England, in particular, were lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, when they made
their greate&s;t efforts to be free. In their zeal to circum&s;cribe the power
of the prince, they fell them&s;elves into a &s;tate of humiliating &s;lavery.
Men of more ability than principle &s;prung, as is u&s;ual, from anarchy
and civil di&s;cord. The fir&s;t cau&s;e of conte&s;t was either forgot or neglect|ed.
Demagogues, as might have been expected, &s;tarted up into tyrants.
The nation lo&s;t its balance, in exerting its force again&s;t the crown; and
de&s;igning men had an intere&s;t in preventing the unwieldy body from reco|vering
from its fall.</P>
<P>This new &s;pecies of tyranny was not, however, de&s;tined to la&s;t long.
A de&s;poti&s;m impo&s;ed, by either terror or force, required a continuance
of the &s;ame abilities by which it had been e&s;tabli&s;hed. The engine which
Cromwell him&s;elf could &s;carce wield with ea&s;e, fell to pieces in the
feeble hands of his &s;on. Anarchy &s;ucceeded, and threatened con&s;e|quences
of the wor&s;t kind. In the mid&s;t of the cabals and factions of
their leaders, the people remained in a melancholy &s;u&s;pence. They re|membered
pa&s;t mi&s;eries, they felt the pre&s;ent, they were anxious for the
future. A majority had been bent, by force, from their principles.
Some, di&s;appointed in their hopes of freedom, others, in their &s;chemes of
power became pa&s;&s;ive, concerning their political fate; and, by a train
of circum&s;tances which human prudence could not have fore&s;een, the
nation reared, in a few months, the fabrick of government, which had
taken them &s;o many years to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>In the violence of the national joy, upon the re&s;toration of monarchy,
men neglected to make &s;uch &s;lipulations as might prevent future di&s;putes
with the crown. This complai&s;ant negligence became afterwards dan|gerous
to the people, and it ruined the family of the prince. Things
being again &s;et afloat, the &s;torm aro&s;e. The memory of pa&s;t mi&s;eries
prevented not future conte&s;ts. A King without principle, and a faction
without patrioti&s;m, armed them&s;elves again&s;t each other, with the pre|judices
of the different parties, which &s;till divided the nation. A victory,
<PB N="5" REF="13">
on either &s;ide, mu&s;t have ruined the balance of the con&s;titution. No in|termediate
choice &s;eemed to have been left, between monarchical de&s;po|ti&s;m
and popular anarchy and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this period of violence, of faction, and of intrigue, the Editor of
the&s;e volumes has cho&s;en to begin his account of the affairs of Great
Britain. The papers contained in the following collection will, he is
per&s;uaded, convince the public, that he has very much to &s;ay, that is
both &s;triking and new. To throw &s;ome light on the work, he will here
premi&s;e a few things which require to be known. The particular expla|nation
of the different papers, the illu&s;tration of the facts which they
contain, the various characters of the principal per&s;ons who are actors
in this comprehen&s;ive political &s;cene, are &s;et forth as the circum|&s;tances
ari&s;e.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Thomas Carte, who gave to the public a hi&s;tory of
England to the end of the year 1654, had been extremely indu&s;trious in
collecting materials for bringing down his work to a much later period.
Having obtained an order from Rome for in&s;pecting &s;uch papers, belong|ing
to the family of Stuart, as LAY OPEN in the Scotch college at Paris,
he &s;pent &s;everal months in that place, making extracts and collecting
notes. In particular, he made very large and accurate extracts from the
Life of James the Second, written in that prince's own hand. But his
mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition was the papers of Mr. Nairne, who had &s;erved
as under-&s;ecretary to three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mini&s;ters of King James, during
his exile in France, from the Revolution to the year 1701. Upon the
death of that prince, Nairne continued in the &s;ervice of his &s;on; and his
collection contains an almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;eries of the corre&s;pondences
and &s;ecret negociations of the family of Stuart, down to the year 1719.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to explain minutely, why papers of &s;uch value lay &s;o
long neglected and almo&s;t unknown. They are jumbled together in &s;uch
a ma&s;s of confu&s;ion, that a great deal of time and indu&s;try, and, it
may even be &s;aid, a very con&s;iderable knowledge of the period to
<PB N="6" REF="14">
which they relate, were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to give them the import|ance
they de&s;erve. They were placed in the Editor's hands, as mate|rials
for a hi&s;tory of this country, from the Revolution till the complete
&s;ettlement of the family of Hannover on the throne. But when he ex|amined
them with preci&s;ion, he found that the extracts from the Life of
James the Second threw a new and &s;triking light, on almo&s;t all the tran&s;|actions
of his brother's reign. This circum&s;tance induced him to begin his
hi&s;tory with the re&s;toration of monarchy; and to &s;atisfy him&s;elf, as well as
to authenticate his materials to the public, he went to Paris to make &s;till
further di&s;coveries, and, in particular, to make fre&s;h extracts from King
James's Memoirs.</P>
<P>During his &s;tay in France, he not only had an opportunity to be &s;a|tisfied,
concerning the faithfulne&s;s of Carte's extracts, but even to make
many valuable additions of his own. The Memoirs left by King James,
in his own hand, con&s;i&s;t rather of memorandums made for his own u&s;e,
when the tran&s;actions happened, than a regular narration of events. He
frequently lays down, with preci&s;ion, the rea&s;ons which weighed with
him&s;elf, in directing his conduct; and, upon the whole, his papers form
very important materials for the hi&s;tory of Britain, during his own times.
In Carte's extracts, as well as in tho&s;e of the Editor, the language of
King James is, in a great mea&s;ure, pre&s;erved. That prince was not
an elegant writer; and an abridgment mu&s;t, in its nature, be &s;till
more &s;tiff and dry than an original. In&s;tead, therefore, of expecting
entertaining reflections, and a well-connected detail of tran&s;actions, the
reader mu&s;t content him&s;elf with an unadorned narrative of &s;uch facts as
were the &s;ecret, and hitherto unknown, &s;prings of the great events of
the times.</P>
<P>But if the Memoirs of King James cannot rai&s;e their author to the
rank of a fine writer, they certainly do him credit as a man. There is
an air of veracity in all the accounts given by that prince, that is much
more valuable to an intelligent reader, than the choice&s;t flowers of rhe|toric
and be&s;t turned periods. Indeed, the manner in which the papers,
called his Memoirs, were written, precludes every &s;u&s;picion of unfaith|fulne&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="15">
on his &s;ide. His notes were generally made upon the &s;pot; and
always before there was any nece&s;&s;ity to palliate the circum&s;tances of the
tran&s;actions related. Be&s;ides, he was not of a complexion to mi&s;repre|&s;ent.
He affected to guide him&s;elf by principle in all his actions; and
to deem the &s;lighte&s;t deviation from truth a crime. In his opinions he is
frequently wrong, but very &s;eldom in any fact that fell within his own
immediate knowledge.</P>
<P>How Nairne's collection came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Carte is as unim|portant
in it&s;elf, as it is imperfectly known. Several papers, particularly
the letters of lord Caryll, which compleat the chain of the &s;ecret corre|&s;pondence
with Britain, are in the Scotch college, and have pa&s;&s;ed through
the Editor's hands. The&s;e, together with others which he received
through various channels, &s;hall be pointed out, as they occur, in the
following volumes.</P>
<P>Though the corre&s;pondences of the hou&s;e of STUART are highly im|portant,
the Editor is very far from deriving his whole information from
that &s;ide. He has received original papers from &s;everal per&s;ons abroad.
At home he owes obligations of the &s;ame kind to a few. Though Mr.
ASTLE, in his PUBLIC capacity, adhered rigidly to the orders of his
office; as a private gentleman, he exhibited all the liberality of the man
of letters. He laid open to the Editor his very valuable collection of
original papers, and &s;ubmitted to his peru&s;al many &s;carce tracts and printed
works, concerning the hi&s;tory of this kingdom, from the Revolution to
the death of Queen Anne.</P>
<P>But it is to Mr. DUANE, the Editor owes the greate&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential
obligations. That gentleman, in his literary re&s;earches, had the good
fortune to di&s;cover, by accident, and to purcha&s;e the papers of the hou&s;e
of Brun&s;wick Lunenburgh, containing their whole corre&s;pondence with
Great Britain, from the pa&s;&s;ing of the act of &s;ettlement till George I.
was firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne. This very valuable collection,
con&s;i&s;ting of ten large volumes, in quarto, the proprietor, with peculiar
conde&s;cen&s;ion and liberality, placed in the hands of the Editor. To
Mr. DUANE, therefore, the public are indebted, for the new, inte|re&s;ting,
<PB N="8" REF="16">
and even complete light, which the&s;e papers throw on the whole
reign of Queen Anne; e&s;pecially on the four la&s;t years of that prince&s;s,
a period hitherto very imperfectly known.</P>
<P>The valuable part of the corre&s;pondence of &s;uch per&s;ons as have made
any figure in this kingdom, mu&s;t have fallen into the papers of the two
families, who were rivals for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown. The Editor
became therefore, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, indifferent about being admitted
to the in&s;pection of private collections. He made few applications of
that kind; and in no one of the&s;e, he had the good fortune to &s;ucceed.
Men having become di&s;tru&s;tful of the principles of their ance&s;tors, are,
from &s;elfi&s;h views, intere&s;ted in their reputation. With a prepo&s;terous &s;hew
of attachment to their progenitors, they &s;eem to think, that to conceal
their actions is the only way to pre&s;erve their &s;ame. The precaution, in
the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, was, however, &s;uper&s;luous. The Editor has been
enabled to give to the public, in this collection, as many particulars,
concerning men in office, as the public would wi&s;h to know. Anecdotes
of a private nature may be left, without any regret, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
their po&s;terity, to whom alone they can be of any importance.</P>
<P>The editor mu&s;t freely acknowledge, that in applying for acce&s;s to
&s;ome PUBLIC collections of papers, he was as un&s;ucce&s;sful as in his pri|vate
applications. He may, however, without vanity affirm, that he
was little di&s;appointed by this refu&s;al. The great line of bu&s;ine&s;s, the
official di&s;patches of &s;ecretaries, the negociations of plenipotentiaries,
and the in&s;tructions to mini&s;ters abroad, having, for the mo&s;t part, fallen,
under the examination of the two hou&s;es of parliament, are, either upon
record in their journals, or publi&s;hed by their order. Where the&s;e publi|cations
are defective, every nece&s;&s;ary information is &s;upplied, by the nu|merous
and authentic memoirs, that have been printed, from time to
time, in France. Be&s;ides, the liberality of the French nation, with
regard to the free acce&s;s to their &s;tate-papers, a favour &s;eldom if ever re|fu&s;ed
to men of letters, makes ample amends for the more uncommuni|cative
di&s;po&s;ition prevailing in this kingdom.</P>
<P>This &s;eeming cen&s;ure, however, mu&s;t, in ju&s;tice, be confined in its
object. The Editor, expecting little that was new, e&s;pecially to HIM,
<PB N="9" REF="17">
on the period he has cho&s;en, made few applications to the keepers of
public libraries. In the univer&s;ity of Oxford, he found &s;ome papers
which he has printed in this collection. He was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;earches
by the reverend Mr. Price, keeper of the Bodleian library, in a
manner, that demand his warme&s;t acknowledgments. He owes fa|vours
of the &s;ame kind, to other gentlemen, in other places. He
al&s;o received papers, from per&s;ons, who&s;e names he is not permitted to
mention to the public. He has, upon the whole, been enabled to fill
up, with intere&s;ting letters and memorials, &s;uch cha&s;ms in the corre|&s;pondences
of the hou&s;es of Stuart and Brun&s;wick, as interrupted
the regular &s;eries of their re&s;pective intrigues and &s;ecret negotiations
in Britain.</P>
<P>To render &s;till more complete his materials, the Editor, when in
France, applied for acce&s;s to the valuable collection of papers, kept at
Ver&s;ailles, in the office of the mini&s;ter for foreign affairs. The duke
d'Aiguillon, who then pre&s;ided in that department, granted his reque&s;t with
peculiar politene&s;s. But, before he could make any u&s;e of this indul|gence,
the death of the King &s;u&s;pended the bu&s;ine&s;s of the public offices;
and he was obliged to return to Britain before the new arrangements were
made. Though the duke re&s;igned his office, the orders he had
given were not recalled by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Several clerks, in the depart|ment
for foreign affairs, were employed, for a con&s;iderable time, in
&s;earching for papers and in an&s;wering &s;uch queries as the Editor thought
proper to &s;ugge&s;t, for the further illu&s;tration of the events compre|hended
within his period.</P>
<P>Having given this &s;hort account of the &s;ources from which he has
derived his information, the Editor thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething
concerning the arrangement of his materials. The order of time has
been throughout followed with exactne&s;s. The papers them&s;elves
have been illu&s;trated by hi&s;torical connexions, accounts of their va|rious
authors, and uninterrupted allu&s;ions to the leading facts to
which they relate. The extracts from the Memoirs of King James
the Second are given, in one continued &s;eries, to the end of the
year 1698. The original papers, arranged with the utmo&s;t attention
<PB N="10" REF="18">
under the heads of their re&s;pective years, begin in the memorable 1688.
At the beginning of every year, e&s;pecially in the reign of Queen Anne,
an explanatory introduction is placed; and the events to which the pa|pers
refer are briefly &s;tated. Nothing, upon the whole, has been
omitted, that might contribute to make the collection an&s;werable to its
title; as it actually comprehends, in the literal &s;en&s;e of the words, the
&s;ecret hi&s;tory of Great Britain, during the period to which it relates.</P>
<P>The Editor has paid throughout, the utmo&s;t attention to the &s;atisfac|tion
and convenience of the public. Nothing is printed, except for
mere illu&s;tration, that ever pa&s;&s;ed before through the pre&s;s; at lea&s;t con|&s;i&s;tent
with the Editor's knowledge; and his reading, on the period of
his hi&s;tory, has been pretty exten&s;ive. Long memorials are abridged.
Where letters are tedious, extracts are only given. But nothing is
omitted that could be thought to contribute to throw any new light,
either on the events of hi&s;tory, or on the characters of men. To le&s;&s;en
the expence to purcha&s;ers, the work is not &s;welled with originals in
languages not generally known. Three fourths of the papers them&s;elves
are in French, Italian, and High Dutch. The&s;e were tran&s;lated, under
the eye of the Editor, with the utmo&s;t care and fidelity. As the
diction of the writers them&s;elves is &s;eldom elegant, more care has
been taken to pre&s;erve the &s;en&s;e, than to embelli&s;h the &s;entiment.
The object of &s;uch publications as the pre&s;ent, is more to in|form
than to amu&s;e the reader; yet the Editor has been at &s;ome
pains to render it agreeable as well as in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the following papers, place has been given
to &s;ome anecdotes and traditions pre&s;erved by the indu&s;trious Mr.
Thomas Carte. Where they are corroborated with collateral proofs,
&s;ome u&s;e has been made of them in the Hi&s;tory. Where they
&s;tand un&s;upported by other evidence, they are left to that degree of
credit, which the reader may choo&s;e to be&s;tow. Such accounts, in their
nature uncertain and liable to deception, lo&s;e their whole force, when
oppo&s;ed by the written te&s;timony of tho&s;e whom they concern. But
when they fall, with ea&s;e and fitne&s;s, into the line of e&s;tabli&s;hed facts,
<PB N="11" REF="19">
they de&s;erve &s;ome portion of hi&s;torical faith. The uniform fairne&s;s, with
which Carte has made his extracts from written monuments, is the be&s;t
proof of his veracity in his traditionary anecdotes. Be&s;ides, he had
frequent opportunities of being well informed. His avowed attachment
to the excluded family, introduced him to the intimacy and friend&s;hip
of &s;everal per&s;ons of rank, who entertained &s;imilar principles; and had
been partly in the &s;ecret of affairs, during the four la&s;t years of Queen
Anne.</P>
<P>The anecdotes pre&s;erved by Carte, in &s;ome in&s;tances, contradict facts
thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed by Nairne's papers. This circum&s;tance fur|ni&s;hes
an argument, that Carte was not apprized of the trea&s;ure
which had fallen into his hands. The labour nece&s;&s;ary in arranging
&s;uch confu&s;ed materials, without which they could not be &s;ufficiently
known, he po&s;tponed, till he &s;hould come down to the period to
which they relate. The deficiency of information in the anecdotes,
may al&s;o be accounted for on other grounds. Tho&s;e who live, in any
period of time, as their knowledge is nece&s;&s;arily confined to one line of
men, have but a very imperfect idea of the whole &s;y&s;tem of national af|fairs
and the intrigues and &s;ecrets of factions. A writer mu&s;t &s;tand, as
it were, in the very point, where informations from all parties unite
and concentrate, to judge of tran&s;actions and of men with preci&s;ion.
He mu&s;t follow no evidence implicitly, but decide on the general re|&s;ult
of the whole proof. This idea of his judicial capacity has a favour|able
effect on a hi&s;torian of any ability. Parties having, in a manner,
&s;ubmitted their differences to his deci&s;ion, his pride prevents him from
being &s;wayed by their prejudices.</P>
<P>In a period replete with important events, and &s;ubject to revolution
and change, the Editor labouring, as it were, under the weight of
facts and materials, may have committed &s;ome mi&s;takes, that may re|quire
the reader's indulgence. He believes, however, that the&s;e are
not, in them&s;elves, material; as he flatters him&s;elf, that he moved,
through his &s;ubject, with a degree of light &s;ufficient to preclude all glaring
errors. In the tran&s;lation of many papers, in making extracts from &s;uch
as were either too unimportant or tedious to be given complete, he
<PB N="12" REF="20">
has frequently availed him&s;elf of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend. But as the
Editor him&s;elf has travelled, with attention, over the &s;ame ground, he
is, as he ought to be, accountable for the defects of the whole.</P>
<P>Such as it is, the Editor delivers the work, with little anxiety, to the
public. The novelty of the facts, the uninterrupted &s;tream of fre&s;h
light, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed, which they throw on the hi&s;tory of
this country, during the period through which they extend, will, he is con|vinced,
recommend the publication to the world. The new turn given
to many important events, and the change made in various great
characters, will, perhaps, offend &s;uch as are bigots, with regard to the
&s;uppo&s;ed political opinions and views of their forefathers. To the&s;e the
Editor has only to &s;ay, that he has religiou&s;ly adhered, throughout, to
TRUTH; and that it could not be expected he &s;hould ri&s;k his OWN
reputation, by concealing any facts that came to his knowledge, though
they might tend to fully the &s;ame of THEIR ance&s;tors.</P>

<HEAD>1660.</HEAD>
<P>THE government of Oliver Cromwell, notwith&s;tanding the vigour
of his councils, being un&s;upported by the opinions of the people,
promi&s;ed neither &s;tability nor permanency. The fabric rai&s;ed, by his
addre&s;s and abilities, was de&s;tined to fall with his own life; and the &s;eeds
of anarchy and confu&s;ion, which his authority had checked in their
growth rather than removed, began to &s;pring forth from the pa&s;&s;ions of
leaders and the prejudices of parties. Sects, who had carried their en|thu&s;ia&s;m
in matters of religion, into their opinions of government, had
remained in that unwilling obedience, which force extorts from fear.
The death of Cromwell, removing the fears of all, gave room to their
re&s;pective hopes. The adherents of the doctrines of the church of Eng|land
looked forward to the re&s;toration of monarchy. The Pre&s;byterians,
oppre&s;&s;ed, for &s;everal years, by the Independents, were ready to gra&s;p
at any change that might put a period to the power of their enemies. The
Republicans them&s;elves preferred the return of the kingly authority to
the continuance of a tyranny, that, under the name of freedom, had &s;ub|jected
the nation to a military government. The mea&s;ures of all the
three were calculated to promote the &s;ame object, though their immediate
views were as different as their principles and inclinations.</P>
<P>Such was the undetermined &s;tate of parties, in England, in the end of
the year 1659. General Monk entered that kingdom, with an army,
on the fir&s;t of January 1660. He found the nation prepared for any
change that might deliver them from the pre&s;ent anarchy. In their fears
from the con&s;equences of the conte&s;ts between the remains of a parliament

they hated and an army they had rea&s;on to fear, very little pre&s;&s;ure was
nece&s;&s;ary to turn the current in favour of monarchy. It is, therefore,
doubtful, whether Monk permitted him&s;elf to be carried down the
&s;tream, or directed its force to favour his own views. His prudence, or
perhaps his timidity, was well &s;uited to the peculiar &s;tate of the times.
When he &s;at, involved in his natural re&s;erve, at the helm, he &s;uffered the
people, in appearance, to &s;teer their own cour&s;e to what they deemed a
permanent &s;ettlement of their di&s;tracted affairs.</P>
<P>A few leading facts may be nece&s;&s;ary to introduce the reader to the fol|lowing
extracts. On Friday, the &s;ixteenth of March, the long parliament was
di&s;&s;olved, by their own act, after having continued, through various inter|ruptions,
for near twenty years. On the twenty-fifth of April, the new par|liament
a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter. On the fir&s;t of May, Anne&s;ly, pre|&s;ident
of the council of &s;tate, pre&s;ented, unopened, a letter from King
Charles the Second to general Monk, to be by him communicated to the
council of &s;tate and officers of the army. The letter was read, with
the utmo&s;t avidity, amid&s;t the repeated &s;houts of the members. The
turbulent joy of parliament was &s;oon communicated to the people. The
King was proclaimed on the eighth of May; and before the end of the
month he arrived in London.</P>
<P>In this period, begin the extracts from the life of King James the
Second, then duke of York. They contain the whole of the &s;e|cret
hi&s;tory of his brother's reign, &s;ome very important facts concerning
his own, and many &s;ecret negociations during the fir&s;t nine years of King
William. The Editor has reduced the whole, for the convenience of the
reader, into the order of time. King James, as the &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ted
it&s;elf to his mind, made notes of the tran&s;actions in which he was mo&s;t
concerned, at different periods. He &s;ometimes kept regular journals of
the facts, as they aro&s;e. His preci&s;ion, with regard to place and time,
cannot be &s;ufficiently commended. In reviewing the facts which he had
&s;et down in his journal, he frequently added circum&s;tances which he had
forgot to record before; and to this mu&s;t be a&s;cribed &s;ome repetitions that
occur in the following extracts.</P>
<P>Some notes concerning the life of James, extracted from his memoirs,
are thrown into the appendix to the &s;econd volume of original pa|pers,
<PB N="15" REF="25">
as they concern a period, prior to his brother's re&s;toration to
the throne. The &s;ub&s;tance of what he wrote from the year 1652 to
1658, was given by him&s;elf to the cardinal de Bouillon, in the year
1695; and they are annexed to the memoirs of the vi&s;count de Tu|renne.
No part of King James's memoirs, after the Re&s;toration, was
ever in the hands of any writer; therefore the extracts, and mo&s;t of the
facts they contain, are new to the world.</P>

<P>Venner's in&s;urrection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1661. Jan.</NOTE> The King was at Port&s;mouth, to &s;ee the Queen-mother
and the prince&s;s Henrietta embark for France. A party of
twenty hor&s;e, under Corbet, came up with Venner in Wood-&s;treet; but
could not break in on them, as the &s;treet was narrow. The train-bands
came up. Only two men had joined them, when they were forced to
get into a hou&s;e to defend them&s;elves. The duke of York and the ge|neral
<PB N="18" REF="28">
took hor&s;e, and, with twenty, no more being left on guard,
marched towards them: but the nobility joined them; &s;o that, before
they reached St. Paul's, they were 1500 hor&s;e. There they met Sir Richard
Brown, lord mayor, who told them Venner and all his party were either
killed or taken. That, Venner being retreated to an ale hou&s;e, they
could not take it without firing, which they dur&s;t not; but one Lam|bert,
a &s;eaman, afterwards commander of the duke's yatcht, and &s;lain
on board the Anne, a third rate, per&s;waded &s;ome to follow him, and get
up to the top of the hou&s;e, and force their entry that way. All Ven|ner's
men were killed or wounded, before they were taken; one only
a&s;ked for quarter, at which a comrade, lying wounded in the room,
endeavoured with his &s;word to kill him, reviling him for being &s;o mean,
as to a&s;k quarter. Venner had nineteen wounds; and the &s;urgeons had
much to do to keep him alive, until he was condemned and hanged, as
the re&s;t were al&s;o, only two &s;erving for witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This made Clarendon write to the King, to &s;top di&s;banding the ge|neral's
troop of hor&s;e guards and regiment of foot, which were to be
paid off that day; and to rai&s;e more men, for the &s;ecurity of the King's
Per&s;on and government. A new regiment of guards, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve
companies, under colonel Ru&s;&s;el; a regiment of hor&s;e of eight troops,
under the earl of Oxford; and a troop of guards, under lord Gerard,
were ordered to be rai&s;ed. The duke of York's troop of guards, then,
at Dunkirk, was &s;ent for. Commi&s;&s;ions al&s;o for the earls of Cleveland,
Northampton, and two other earls, for regiments of hor&s;e, and to name
their own officers, who had commi&s;&s;ions to enli&s;t men in &s;everal com|panies,
not to be in pre&s;ent pay, but ready in ca&s;e of need.</P>
<P>The chancellor and Southampton were carele&s;s of the King's &s;afety.
Hawley was a wi&s;er &s;tate&s;man. They and the bi&s;hops, in the hou&s;e of
lords, were great oppo&s;ers of the King's de&s;ign, according to the pro|mi&s;e
at Breda, of a toleration of di&s;&s;enters, &s;o limited as not to di&s;turb
the peace of the realm. So the King's word was broke. The earl of
Bri&s;tol, though no privy coun&s;ellor, was as much in the &s;ecret of af|fairs
as formerly. Bri&s;tol was of a haughty temper, yet contributed
to the chancellor's ruin. The chancellor was very loyal and true to the
intere&s;t of the crown; but did not repeal acts of Charles I. detrimental
to the crown and revenue.</P>

<P>The generality of the nation was plea&s;ed at the King's re&s;toration,
yet the re&s;tle&s;s republican &s;pirit began to ferment. Venner, on Sunday,
January 6th, after preaching to his congregation, and fa&s;ting all the
day with them, being before provided with arms, marched out of the
meeting-hou&s;e, between eleven and twelve at night, with about thirty,
crying, &startq;Live king Je&s;us;&endq; that all that were for him &s;hould join with
them; and tho&s;e who would not, might keep their hou&s;es. The con|&s;tables
and watch dur&s;t not venture to attack them. Venner, not being
joined, went into the woods near Highgate. The King was then at
Port&s;mouth, with the Queen-mother and the prince&s;s Henrietta, to &s;ee
them embark for France. The duke of York, being indi&s;po&s;ed, was at
Whitehall with the dutche&s;s, the marriage being owned before.</P>
<P>General Monk, who lived at the Cockpit, being allarmed, came to
give the duke of York an account. Some gentlemen-hor&s;e left unpaid
off, that lord Gerard had li&s;ted for hor&s;e guards, and the general's own
troop, commanded by Sir Philip Howard, were &s;ent after them; but
Venner kept the woods two or three days, then came with twenty-nine
men into London, through Aldgate, about &s;even in the morning, crying as
before: &s;o to Leadenhall, the Exchange, and Wood&s;treet; where twenty
of Gerard's hor&s;e met them, and drove them into Wood&s;treet. There
they made head, till the train-bands grew numerous, and the duke of
York, with the general and twenty hor&s;e, and abundance of nobility and
gentry, came to St. Pauls. The lord mayor, Sir Richard Brown, in|formed
them that they were all either killed or taken. Venner had nine|teen
wounds, yet he was kept alive till condemned and hanged. This
prevented the general's troop of hor&s;e guards, and his regiment of foot,
from being di&s;banded, which had been paid off that very day; and
cau&s;ed more men to be rai&s;ed. Daniel O'Neil was &s;ent with an account
to the King, who immediately ordered a new regiment of guards, con|&s;i&s;ting
of twelve companies, under colonel John Ru&s;&s;el, brother to the
earl of Bedford, and always loyal, to be rai&s;ed; and a troop of hor&s;e
guards, under lord Gerard, and a regiment of hor&s;e, of eight troops,
under the earl of Oxford. The King &s;ent for the duke of York's troop
of guards from Dunkirk, and gave commi&s;&s;ions to the earls of Cleve|land,
<PB N="20" REF="30">
Northampton, and two other earls, for regiments of hor&s;e, and to
name their under officers, to levy men, not to be in pre&s;ent pay, but to
be in readine&s;s in ca&s;e of need. Lord Hawley told the King, he now
looked on him as one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men in England, &s;ince
he had rai&s;ed the&s;e troops; as his enemies would fear him, and his friends
love him the better. The nation &s;aw the &s;ectaries would not be quiet.</P>
<P>The duke of Glouce&s;ter died about the middle of September, in the
preceding year; a prince of the greate&s;t hopes, great courage, admirable
parts and under&s;tanding. He had a particular gift of languages;
ma&s;ter, be&s;ides the Latin, of French, Spani&s;h, Italian, and low Dutch;
and but twenty years of age. The prince&s;s of Orange died al&s;o, on

of his <HI>&s;he-friend,</HI> have ruined the chancellor, as he de&s;igned. But the
King knew him too well, to put him at the head of his affairs. Being
vexed, he accu&s;ed the chancellor in the hou&s;e of lords; and flew in the
King's face, by making an indecent &s;peech in the hou&s;e; and then ju&s;|tified
it to the King, in lord Aubigny's pre&s;ence. He flew out into
extravagant expre&s;&s;ions, threatening his enemies, and the King &s;hould

if Tangier could, as was then thought, be made a &s;afe harbour for our

a Queen to England of his own chu&s;ing; yet this was the occa&s;ion of

his ruin. The Queen landed on the twentieth of May; and, after
repo&s;ing a little time, &s;he was married by lord Abigny, the Queen's al|moner;
privately. The outward ceremony was performed by Dr. Shel|don.
The Portugue&s;e, more &s;crupulous than other nations, would not
let her marry in Portugal by a prote&s;tant proxy. Many other propo|&s;itions
were made to the King. One of Mazarine's nieces, a little be|fore

held private meetings, into which were admitted all &s;orts of di&s;&s;enters,

church and &s;tate; and they always broke up in a heat. As to the fir&s;t,
they could never agree and come to a conclu&s;ion; their council con&s;i&s;ting
of all &s;orts of di&s;&s;enters, quakers, &amp;c. Their number was, at length,
reduced to &s;ix; yet they &s;eldom met, without running into &s;ome incon|venience.
The King was adverti&s;ed of this, from time to time, by &s;pies
and fal&s;e brethren; and he &s;ecured &s;ome old officers of the army, major
Wildman and others. They were kept in pri&s;on till the year 1667,
when chancellor Hyde was laid a&s;ide. De&s;igns of an in&s;urrection at
London and in the north about York. In London, &s;ome of the train|bands
were to &s;hoot the King, when &s;aluted at a review; and one Brad|ford,
a &s;erjeant of a militia regiment, at their con&s;ultations, &s;aid, if others
&s;hould mi&s;s the king, he would di&s;patch him with his halbert; nor did
he deny his words, when taken and brought in chains to the King.
They were proved afterwards at his trial. One Ridge, a pre&s;byterian
preacher, denied all at fir&s;t; but confe&s;&s;ed afterwards, and &s;erved for a
witne&s;s at the trials. The man became a true penitent, and was made
mate or ma&s;ter at &s;ea; and he was killed, in the year 1666, in the four
days fight.</P>
<P>The con&s;piracy in York&s;hire was di&s;covered al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The follow|ing pa&s;&s;ages of this extract &s;eem to have been written, by James, &s;ome time af|ter the fir&s;t Dutch war.</NOTE> by fal&s;e brethren.
No gentleman engaged in it, but Mr. Stockdale, and only for mi&s;pri|&s;ion.
He &s;erved after in parliament. In the war, they kept intelli|gence
with the Dutch; but the old general di&s;covered all their de&s;igns,
el&s;e they had ri&s;en when the plague was in London, and the King had
left it. The arms they had provided were all lo&s;t in the fire of Lon|don,
which they had been getting together for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>The chancellor continued chief mini&s;ter; the earl of Falmouth<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Formerly Sir Charles Berkley, the friend and companion of the duke of York, in all his campaigns.</NOTE> in
the highe&s;t favour, minding his ma&s;ter's, not his own, concerns. He
was killed at &s;ea, and died not worth a farthing, though not expen&s;ive.
He had &s;erved the old cavaliers. Arlington came back from Spain, and
tried to get into favour, &s;upported at fir&s;t by the chancellor and Bri&s;tol,

again&s;t Falmouth; but, after Falmouth's death, the chancellor repented it.
Sir William Coventry, the duke of York's &s;ecretary, and a very able man,
was not well with the chancellor; and he helped the chancellor's fall.
The duke of Buckingham was not of the King's privy council; but
in&s;inuated him&s;elf into his favour, by his agreeable conver&s;e. He was
afterwards made privy-councillor and ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He purcha&s;ed that office, from the Duke of Albemarle.</NOTE> By his rail|leries,

great quantities of Engli&s;h manufactures, in. part-payment for wines;
and to take rea&s;onable rates, who would take nothing but ready money,
when the company broke and rai&s;ed the price very much, to the damage
of the nation. The declaration about kneeling at the communion was
put in, on promi&s;e of the di&s;&s;enters to conform. It was made to the

<P>Complaints of the merchants.&mdash;Satisfaction demanded by the hou&s;e of
commons and the nation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1664.</NOTE> Re&s;olution of both hou&s;es for redre&s;s. The
Dutch refu&s;e all rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction. Van Gough perceived the King
was not much inclined to a war, and the chancellor aver&s;e to it. He
told the States it would be no war; when the duke of York told him
&s;eriou&s;ly, in friend&s;hip, that, without &s;atisfaction, it would certainly be;
but he did not believe him, taking it for a de&s;ign to terrify them. The
King was nece&s;&s;itated, by the general outcry of the nation, to declare
war in the beginning of February. This was occa&s;ioned chiefly by pri|vate
orders &s;ent to de Ruyter, then in the Streights with twelve men of
war, to victual at Cadiz and &s;ail to the coa&s;t of Africa; to take Cor|mantine
ca&s;tle, in time of peace, and all the Engli&s;h factories on that
coa&s;t. Sir John Law&s;on, &s;u&s;pecting their de&s;ign, gave notice of it to
the duke of York, by letters. On further news of de Ruyter's failing
&s;outhward, and &s;eizing Cape de Verd, prince Rupert was ordered, with
twelve men of war and &s;ix company's &s;hips of, at lea&s;t, forty guns
each; and the fleet &s;ailed about the middle of October. But the Dutch
having fitted a greater fleet, under Opdam, a &s;tronger was re&s;olved to
<PB N="26" REF="36">
be fitted out, under the duke of York's command; who &s;et out in No|vember
for Port&s;mouth, and joined prince Rupert and the earl of Sand|wich.
Opdam dur&s;t not come out, and his &s;hips were laid up. The
duke then returned to Spithead and came to Whitehall, leaving the earl
of Sandwich to command.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth of November, the parliament met, and gave
two millions and a half for the Dutch war. War was declared on the
fourth of March.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT II.</HEAD>
<P>The Dutch endeavoured to &s;upplant the Engli&s;h trade every where.
The lord chancellor alone again&s;t the Dutch war. The duke of York
got a patent, a joint &s;tock, and &s;et up the African company, when near
ruined. Sir Robert Holmes took &s;ome Engli&s;h forts on the Gambia,
which had got into the Dutch hands, and &s;ettled the company's affairs.
The Dutch &s;ent a &s;quadron again&s;t him, and fell on the Engli&s;h on the
coa&s;t of Guinea. De Ruyter victualled at Cadiz for his expedition;
when Sir John Law&s;on coming thither, with twelve men of war, al&s;o
judged, by it, of his de&s;ign; and would fain have fought him, but
dur&s;t not without orders, &s;o came for England. De Ruyter took twelve
of the company's &s;hips at anchor at Cape de Verd, with the fort. The
frigate got away. He de&s;troyed all the factories on the coa&s;t of Guinea.
A &s;quadron was ordered again&s;t de Ruyter of twelve &s;hips, under prince
Rupert, of third, fourth, and fifth rates, with &s;ix company's &s;hips of
fourty guns each; but Opdam being to &s;econd de Ruyter, prince Rupert
waited at Spithead till a further recruit. Some &s;econd, third, and fourth
rates were ordered to join him in November.</P>
<P>The fleet had been much increa&s;ed in the u&s;urpation; yet, by changes
and revolutions, after Oliver Cromwell's death, was but in an ill con|dition
at the re&s;toration. Naval &s;tores were much exhau&s;ted; magazines
entirely empty. The parliament gave 1200,000 <HI>l.</HI> The King, under|&s;tanding
the true intere&s;t of the nation, and having a particular incli|nation
to maritime affairs, ordered 800,000 of it for the fleet. The
mo&s;t part was laid out n naval &s;tores, and in filling the magazines, to
be ready to fit out the fleet. He encouraged the Ea&s;t India, Turkey,
Hamburgh, Canary, and other companies of trade. He &s;et up one for
Guinea, nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the plantations, and for hindering
<PB N="27" REF="37">
the Dutch from being ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of the whole trade; and, by the
indu&s;try of Sir Richard Ford and other merchants, got the &s;ecret from
the Dutch of dying &s;ays of &s;uch a colour as the blacks liked, and giving
them the &s;ame &s;mell, in packing up, as the Dutch u&s;ed to do at Leyden,
from whence all the &s;ays &s;ent to Guinea were brought before.</P>
<P>The Dutch, during the civil wars in England, had encroached every
where on the Engli&s;h trade; and had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h of Cor|mantine
ca&s;tle, on the gold coa&s;t. The duke of York, at the &s;etting
up of the African company, had borrowed two &s;hips of the King, and
&s;ent them, under Sir Robert Holmes, with &s;ome of the company's &s;hips
and a few land men. They &s;eized the fort at Cape de Verd, retook the
ca&s;tle of Cormantine, and left garri&s;ons in both. They &s;ettled factories
of the company's all along the coa&s;t. Some time after, the king gave
to the duke a patent for Long I&s;land, in the We&s;t Indies, and a tract
of Land between New England and Maryland, which always belonged
to the crown of England, &s;ince fir&s;t di&s;covered; and upon which the
Dutch had encroached, during the rebellion, and built a town and &s;ome
forts to &s;ecure the beaver trade to them&s;elves. The duke of York, bor|rowing
of the King two &s;hips of war, &s;ent Sir Richard Nicholas, groom
of the bed-chamber, and an old officer, with three hundred men, to
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country; which the Dutch gave up, on compo|&s;ition,
without being blockaded. Mo&s;t of the Dutch inhabitants re|mained
there. The re&s;t were of Old England inhabitants, and &s;ome of
other nations, who had planted there, at fir&s;t, with the Engli&s;h. Colonel
Nicholas remained there, in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country; and then
called it New York and the Fort of River Albany.</P>
<P>All this happened before the breaking out of the fir&s;t Dutch war;
and, as the duke of York did all on his &s;ide to advance trade, the par|liament,
pre&s;&s;ed by the King, did all on theirs to make it flouri&s;h, by
the Act of Navigation, &amp;c. for encouraging trade and building &s;hips.
All the people's heads, hearts, and pur&s;es turned that way. They be|gan,
therefore, to enquire into the injuries and depredations of the
Dutch, during the late civil wars, in all trading parts of the world;
and, at la&s;t, the hou&s;e of commons entered into it; and the nation in
general concluded, that &s;atisfaction &s;hould be had of the Dutch. But
this was impracticable without a war. The Dutch would give no &s;ati&s;faction
<PB N="28" REF="38">
or redre&s;s to the merchants, for the injuries done them; believing
that the nation would not enter into the merchants quarrel, at the ex|pence
of a &s;ea war; e&s;pecially as the chancellor Hyde was aver&s;e to a
war, and the King not inclined to it. But by the impetuo&s;ity of the
members of the hou&s;e of commons, as well as the traders and &s;eamen,
who u&s;ed to get the better of the Dutch in Oliver Cromwell's time, the
chancellor could not with&s;tand the bent of the whole nation, which drew
it on &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e it would have been.</P>
<P>The duke of York told Van Gough, the Dutch amba&s;&s;ador, that it
would be carried again&s;t the King and the chancellor's inclinations, un|le&s;s
&s;atisfaction was given: but in vain. De Wit, having had a private
power from the States, with the advice of three or four more of their
body, to do what he judged be&s;t for the public good, on advice of what
Sir Robert Holmes had done, &s;ent private orders to de Ruyter, then in
the Streights with twelve men of war, to take in a &s;ufficient &s;upply of
victuals at Cadiz, and fail for Africa; to take the ca&s;tle of Cormantine,
and to ruin all the factories on the gold coa&s;t. Law&s;on found, by the
&s;ort of victuals, de Ruyter's de&s;ign; but, in a council of war, it was
re&s;olved not to attack him without orders.</P>
<P>The duke of York, in November 1664, put to &s;ea, with forty men
of war, to &s;top Opdam between Portland and la Hogue. After four
or five days, he returned to Port&s;mouth; Opdam having orders not to
&s;tir. A &s;mall &s;quadron was left to cruize off the I&s;le of Wight.</P>

<P>On the fifteenth of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1665. March 15th.</NOTE> the duke of York went to Gunfleet, the
general rendevous of the fleet, and ha&s;ted their equipment; yet was not
ready in five weeks. He ordered all the flag-officers on board with him
every morning, to agree on the order of battle and rank. In former
battles no order was kept; and this, under the duke of York, was the
fir&s;t, in which fighting in a line and regular form of battle had been
ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>In the beginning of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> the duke of York put to &s;ea, with a fleet
of ninety-eight men of war; the greate&s;t England had ever &s;een. The
duke him&s;elf in the Royal Charles. The Dutch not appearing, the
<PB N="29" REF="39">
duke re&s;olved to vi&s;it them on their own coa&s;t. He anchored near the
mouth of the Texel, and viewed all their fleet in the harbour. They
&s;et up beacons, fearing a landing. The duke, after taking ten Dutch
merchant-men, returned to Gunfleet, to repair and take in fre&s;h water;
and went out again, on the thirtieth of May, making all the u&s;e he
could of the tide, becau&s;e the ea&s;t wind would bring the Dutch upon
the Engli&s;h coa&s;t; and the duke could not, till June 1&s;t, get to Southwold
bay, where he anchored; and about one <HI>p. m.</HI> the Dutch fleet appeared
to windward, con&s;i&s;ting of an hundred and thirteen men of war, eleven
fire &s;hips, and &s;even yauchts, under Opdam. Some of the greate&s;t of
the Engli&s;h &s;hips had gone, that morning, to make up their compli|ment,
out of a great fleet of colliers pa&s;&s;ing by, and bound for London.
The wind, which was &s;till ea&s;terly, fell, towards evening, &s;o low, that
no great way could be made; yet both fleets endeavoured to get what
wind there was.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> the Dutch were not &s;een till ten in the morn|ing.
The duke, with a fre&s;h gale, &s;tood towards them, with thirty of
his be&s;t &s;ailers, but thought fit to keep about two leagues di&s;tance, till
all the fleet joined; then, in order, he advanced forwards; &s;o that, be|fore
clo&s;e of evening, both were within two leagues of one another.
The duke was then about eight leagues ea&s;t of Leo&s;toff, and the weather
calm all the night.</P>
<P>About two next morning, the Dutch were di&s;covered lighting their
matches and preparing for fight. They ob&s;erved the &s;ame order of
battle as the Engli&s;h, all in a line. At day-break, a fre&s;h gale aro&s;e at
&s;outh-we&s;t; and the duke got the wind. The white &s;quadron had the
van, and Sir C. Myres, who fired the fir&s;t &s;hot, led it; whil&s;t the Dutch
were led on by three flag &s;hips, Tromp, Courtenaer, and Stellingwers.</P>
<P>At three in the morning, the fight began<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The two accounts that follow of this battle, are almo&s;t in every circum&s;tance new to the world.</NOTE>. When the Dutch van
came up, the duke ordered the &s;ignal to be given for his whole fleet to
tack; but the &s;ailor, who had got up the ma&s;t to give the &s;ignal, was
&s;o long about it, that before he could let the flag fly, Opdam had,
with the van, bore up round, &s;hip after &s;hip, and brought his &s;tarboard
tacks on board; which the enemy's van &s;eeing, &s;prung their luff, hoping
<PB N="30" REF="40">
to weather mo&s;t of the white &s;quadron. The duke ob&s;erving this, &s;topped
the intended &s;ignal, left it might put the whole fleet in di&s;order; and, in|&s;tead
of bearing up round, as mo&s;t of the white had done, he tacked only
when it came to his turn. This little accident lo&s;t above &s;ix hours; and then
the duke gave the &s;ignal; whereby the whole fleet tacked at once. Both
fleets had now their &s;tarboard tacks on board, and lay as clo&s;e hauled as
they could. But the Dutch found great benefit by this accident: for
had the &s;ignal been given as &s;oon as it was intended, both the Engli&s;h
and they would have had their larboard tacks on board, and would have
&s;tood towards the coa&s;t of England; &s;o that, when the Dutch gave
way, they would have been more expo&s;ed, by having a greater run to
make toward their own coa&s;t.</P>
<P>In the two fir&s;t pa&s;&s;es, little damage was done. The Dutch only took
the Charity, of fifty guns; a &s;low failer, which had been taken from
them in the fir&s;t Dutch war. Both fleets endeavoured to get the wind.
The duke of York, in the Royal Charles, a very good &s;ailer, got a-head
of the earl of Sandwich, who was in the Prince, a heavy &s;ailer, though
the &s;toute&s;t &s;hip in the fleet. Had not the duke done &s;o, the Dutch
would have &s;tretched out a-head, and might have weathered him. The
duke, with the red &s;quadron, had now the van, the blue the battle, and
the white the rear.</P>
<P>The heat of the engagement began at ten in the morning; a fre&s;h
gale at &s;outh-we&s;t, and not a cloud in the &s;ky. The duke bore down
on Opdam. About two <HI>p. m.</HI> the Dutch fire began to dimini&s;h. Op|dam
was blown up at the third &s;hot of the duke's gunner. All the
Dutch fleet ran, except the Orange, commanded by Seba&s;tian Seaton,
a Scot, who attempted to board the duke of York; but was hin|dered,
by Sir Jeremy Smith, who, by a broad&s;ide, killed &s;ixty of his
men; and the Royal Catherine pouring in another, the Orange &s;truck.
The Mar&s;oman of eighty guns and two other Dutch &s;hips were burnt,
by a fire-&s;hip, after they had &s;truck. The duke ordered the captain of
the fire-&s;hip to be tried; but he fled before the time appointed for his
trial. The Dutch were cha&s;ed to the mouth of the Texel, but they got
in, the Engli&s;h having no fire-&s;hip to fa&s;ten on them. The duke &s;tood
out to &s;ea again; and returned to the buoy at the Nore. He &s;ent &s;couts
to watch the Dutch, who took two of their &s;hips of forty guns. The
command of the fleet, by the King's orders, was left to the earl of Sand|wich;
<PB N="31" REF="41">

<P>The duke of York went from London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> on the twenty-third of March,
to Gunfleet, the general rendevous, to take the command of the fleet;
but could not &s;ail till the beginning of May. Yet he did not lo&s;e his
time. He called the officers on board of him every morning, and &s;ettled
the orders of battle and watch. For though they fought well in Oliver
Cromwell's time, they ob&s;erved not due order; and bravery alone car|ried
it. The war, this year, was the fir&s;t in which the fleet was drawn
up in a line and in order.</P>
<P>The fleet con&s;i&s;ted of ninety-eight &s;hips of the line: three fir&s;t rates,
eleven &s;econd, fifteen third, thirty-two fourth, eleven fifth, and twenty-&s;ix
merchant-&s;hips, armed with fourty or fifty guns; four fire-&s;hips, three &s;ixth
rate frigates, and three yachts, be&s;ides ketches. The duke of York com|manded
the red, admiral Law&s;on vice admiral, and Sir William Berkeley
rear admiral. Prince Rupert, vice admiral of the fleet, commanded
the white &s;quadron, Sir Chri&s;topher Mimmes and captain Samp&s;on his
vice and rear admirals. The earl of Sandwich, rear admiral of the fleet,
commanded the blue, and Sir George Ay&s;cue and captain Tiddeman his
vice and rear admirals.</P>
<P>In May the duke &s;ailed toward Holland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> and then from Sch$veling to the
Texel, where he &s;aw the Dutch fleet at anchor. He &s;teered ten leagues
off, to let the fleet come out. About nine in the morning, the fog
clearing up, he &s;aw ten Dutch merchant &s;hips, e&s;corted by two men of
war; which la&s;t e&s;caped, but the merchant &s;hips were all taken. A
&s;torm de&s;troying the ma&s;ts of &s;ome of the &s;hips, he returned to Gunfleet
to re&s;it and take in water.</P>
<P>About the end of May he &s;ailed again; and, expecting the Dutch
fleet at &s;ea, as it proved, got, on the fir&s;t of June, with great difficulty,
to Southwold bay. Two &s;cout &s;hips, which were &s;ent towards Hol|land,
under captain Golding of the Diamond, and captain Ayliffe of the
Yarmouth, took two Zealand direction-&s;hips. Five hundred coalliers
<PB N="32" REF="42">
pa&s;&s;ed by him without an e&s;cort; and, about an hour after, the Dutch
fleet, one hundred and thirteen &s;hips of the line, and thirteen fire-&s;hips,
appeared, under Opdam, a brave man, but no &s;eaman. Tromp, under
him, commanded the Am&s;terdam &s;quadron. J. Evert&s;on admiral of
Zealand, and Stellingwers of Friezland.</P>
<P>The next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> June the &s;econd, at day-break, the Dutch fleet were
not &s;een; nor were they &s;een till ten. Two leagues off, &s;ome Engli&s;h
&s;hips were pre&s;&s;ing &s;ailors out of the coalliers, to make up their equipage.
The duke of York failed towards them; and, before night, eight
leagues ea&s;t of Leo&s;toff, came within a &s;mall league of the Dutch.</P>
<P>The next day, June the third, the Dutch fleet were found in a line, like
the Engli&s;h. A little wind, S. W. ro&s;e at day-break; the fight began at
three; being the fir&s;t day that could be found for an engagement. The &s;ea
was &s;mooth, and not a cloud in the &s;ky. Sir. J. Law&s;on was wounded in
the knee, by a great &s;hot; his &s;hip di&s;abled, and forced to lay by to re&s;it;
and all his divi&s;ion, not yet well ver&s;ed in fighting orders, did &s;o to
look after their flag. The duke of York, with only four or five &s;hips
a-head of him, bore the hotte&s;t of the fight. The earl of Falmouth,
lord Mu&s;kerry, and Mr. Boyle were all &s;lain with one &s;hot, as they &s;tood
on the quarter-deck, by the duke of York. The earl of Marlborough
and his nephew, the earl of Portland, were al&s;o &s;lain. Mu&s;kerry was a
gentleman of the bed-chamber to the duke of York, a brave man, and
a good foot officer. Falmouth, a good hor&s;e officer, and captain of
the duke of York's guards. Boyle, who had never been in any &s;ervice
before, was the earl of Burlington's &s;on.</P>
<P>By the fire of the duke of York's lowe&s;t tier of guns, at the third
&s;hot, gun after gun, Opdam blew up, and the Dutch fleet all fled. About
half an hour after two, four of their &s;hips fell foul of one another,
and, the duke ordering a fire-&s;hip to clap them a-board, they were all
fired in a moment; and the men, jumping into the &s;ea, were taken up.
The fourth &s;quadron of the Dutch appearing to we&s;tward, the Duke of
York lay by, whil&s;t the body of the fleet followed the cha&s;e. The duke
of York getting again on head of the Dutch, three more of their &s;hips
fell foul of one another, about &s;ix <HI>p. m.</HI> and were burnt by a fire-&s;hip.
Very few were &s;aved. The Dutch were pur&s;ued till night; and had it
<PB N="33" REF="43">
not been for an accident<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Burnet a&s;cribes it prepo&s;terou&s;ly to de&s;ign. He has &s;trangely mi&s;repre&s;ented this fact; and indeed almo&s;t all the facts, concerning this unfortunate prince.</NOTE>, mo&s;t of them would have been taken next
morning before they got into the Texel.</P>
<P>When it began to grow dark, the duke ordered the Norwich, a fifth
rate, captain Witwang, to keep ju&s;t a-head of him all night, to carry
lights out, and keep up clo&s;e with the Dutch; that, if they &s;hould clear
their cour&s;e, to fire guns and make fal&s;e fires, to put up more lights,
and to &s;teer the &s;ame cour&s;e with them; &s;o as not to lo&s;e them in the
night, in order to engage them at day-break. After giving the&s;e orders,
he &s;taid on deck till quite dark; then went down to his cabin for a little
re&s;t. But before he laid down, he went again on the quarter-deck, to
&s;ee how all went; and, going down about eleven, he repeated his or|ders,
to be &s;ure to keep clo&s;e up with the Dutch, to fight them when
the day broke. He had no &s;ooner laid him&s;elf down on a quilt, with
his cloaths on, than H. Brounker went up to the quarter-deck, and tried
to per&s;uade captain Cox, ma&s;ter of the Royal Charles, to &s;horten &s;ail,
not to expo&s;e the duke of York, by running among&s;t his enemies in the
night; his &s;hip being &s;o good a &s;ailer, that not only he might find him|&s;elf,
at day-break, too far engaged among them, but be al&s;o expo&s;ed to
have &s;ome of their fire-&s;hips clapt on board him, and thwart his hau&s;e,
in the night: that he &s;hould take care of the duke's per&s;on, being heir
to the crown. Cox an&s;wered, he was but ma&s;ter of the &s;hip; that the
duke of York had ordered to make what &s;ail he could; and, without a
command from him, or an order from &s;ome &s;uperior officer, he neither
could nor would do it.</P>
<P>Brounker then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to captain Harman, fir&s;t lieutenant,
a brave and experienced commander, and a man of good &s;en&s;e, u&s;ing
the &s;ame and other arguments; but in vain, unle&s;s ordered by Sir W.
Pen, the captain. Brounker went under deck, and coming up again,
told Harman that the duke ordered him to &s;horten fail, though he never
&s;o much as went into the duke's cabin. Harman not thinking it po&s;&s;ible
for a gentleman to tell a lye, not only &s;hortened fail, but, after &s;ome
time, brought to; as was afterwards proved, on examination of the
affair before the hou&s;e of commons. But fearing it might produce &s;ome
<PB N="34" REF="44">
di&s;order in the fleet, as it did, he put in a &s;hort time before the wind
again, and &s;ettled his top&s;ails a little; and ju&s;t as day began to break,
hoi&s;ted them a trip again, a moment before the duke, who knew nothing
of what had pa&s;&s;ed, came on the quarter-deck.</P>
<P>Thus the Dutch got a good deal a-head of us; and when it grew
light, the duke of York found him&s;elf half a league a-&s;tern of the
Dutch, and the like di&s;tance a-head of the body of his own fleet, with
only the Centurion, a fourth rate, captain Moulton, and two of his
yachts near him. He fancied his &s;hip being a good &s;ailer made him &s;o
far a-head of his own fleet; and that the Dutch had out&s;ailed him, by
our going right before the wind, and their drawing le&s;s water than us.
The Dutch kept all their &s;ail to the Texel, followed by third and fourth
rates, who took &s;ome. But the tyde not &s;erving to enter the Texel,
they came to an anchor &s;o near the &s;ands, and in &s;uch &s;hallow water,
that we dur&s;t not venture near them with our great &s;hips; and they were
of too much force, and too numerous, for our &s;mall ones. Four or
five fire-&s;hips would have de&s;troyed the mo&s;t of them, before the tyde
turned them in. But we had only four fire-&s;hips when the fight began;
three of which were &s;pent, and one di&s;abled. The third had been &s;pent
on the Helverton of &s;ixty-&s;ix guns, which cleared it&s;elf of her, but was
taken. The Dutch lo&s;t twenty or twenty-two men of war; all above
fourty guns but one. Eight only were burnt; and about eight thou&s;and
pri&s;oners taken. Four admirals were &s;lain, Opdam, Courtenaer, Stel|lingwerts,
and Seram; one vice admiral and one rear admiral. Ten
thou&s;and men were either &s;lain, drowned, burnt, taken or wounded.
Not above eight hundred Engli&s;h &s;lain and wounded, be&s;ides what were
lo&s;t in the Charity. Sir J. Law&s;on died of the wound in his knee. The
duke of York returning to the Buoy at the Nore, the earl of Sandwich
was left in the command of the fleet; and he went to intercept de
Ruyter and the Dutch Ea&s;t India fleet and &s;hips, coming round from the
Streights, by the back of Ireland and Scotland. The duke would have
gone to &s;ea again, but the King would not permit him.</P>
<P>The plague broke out in London. The King went to Sali&s;bury. He
&s;ent, at the &s;ame time, the duke of York to York, to take care of the
northern counties; and left the duke of Albemarle and the earl of
Craven, with half of the foot guards and a troop of hor&s;e, to take care
<PB N="35" REF="45">
of London, left the republicans and fanatics, encouraged by the Dutch,
&s;hould ri&s;e. The duke of York knew nothing of Brounker's affair,
till the parliament met at Oxford, in October; when he was very angry,
that it had been concealed from him. The hou&s;e of commons examin|ing
it, the duke was hindered from trying Brounker by a court martial.
He withdrew into France; and the hou&s;e of commons only expelled him.</P>
<P>The faction at court, again&s;t the chancellor, began to increa&s;e. The
duche&s;s of Cleveland, then promoting Buckingham and Arlington, railed
again&s;t him. Sir William Coventry and all laboured to &s;et the hou&s;e of
commons again&s;t the chancellor. They advi&s;ed the King to break the
Canary company, who took off every year two hundred thou&s;and
pounds of our woollen manufactures; and had the wines very cheap,
being ma&s;ters of the trade. When the company was broke, the Ca|narians
made them pay twice as much for wines, and would take no|thing
but ready money. The rea&s;on was plain: the fir&s;t &s;hip which ar|rived
there, not caring what &s;he paid for loading, being &s;ure of &s;elling
it as &s;he plea&s;ed, at her return to England; the Canarians made the re&s;t
pay the &s;ame rate, which could not happen to a company. Bri&s;tol's
attacks on the chancellor, in the hou&s;e of Lords, mi&s;carried. The
King &s;upporting the chancellor, Bri&s;tol harrangued the commons, with|out
leave from the lords.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e of commons were weary of the war, which they had forced
the King into. The mini&s;ters de&s;ired peace, the parliament not &s;up|plying
the King to carry on the war with vigour. This cau&s;ed the differ|ence;
&s;ince the money would not &s;uffice to fit out the whole fleet. The
duke of York oppo&s;ed this &s;cheme, thinking it would have a contrary
effect: for though the la&s;t year's &s;ucce&s;s was not great, we lo&s;ing ten,
and the Dutch but four, men of war; yet the Dutch &s;eamen were &s;o
di&s;couraged, by the valour of the Engli&s;h, when overpowered and un|able
to re&s;i&s;t them, on equal numbers, that it would be very hard for
them to man their fleet; and then they would be forced to take the
&s;ame re&s;olution propo&s;ed by the lords, and might probably propo&s;e a
peace. But if our great &s;hips were laid up, their fleet would not want
men; and though the money was &s;hort, yet, with good hu&s;bandry and
other means, the whole fleet might be fitted out: though the project
might &s;ave the King money, yet it would be burden&s;ome to the nation;
for the Dutch being ma&s;ters at &s;ea, all the militia upon the coa&s;t mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be rai&s;ed and kept in arms during the Summer. He urged
al&s;o, the danger the great &s;hips would run at Chatham. He, however,
did not prevail; the chancellor joining with the others again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="48">
This &s;o encouraged the Dutch &s;eamen, that their fleet was &s;oon and
fully manned. They came up to the Buoy at the Nore. They de|&s;troyed
&s;even &s;hips at Chatham, and carried away the Charles, a fir&s;t
rate; and, had they pre&s;&s;ed vigorou&s;ly on, they might have done more
mi&s;chief. Had the directions given by the duke of York, for &s;ecuring
the &s;hips at Chatham, been executed, and the fire-&s;hips and boats u&s;ed,
as projected, the Dutch had not found &s;o ea&s;y a work as they did. The
di&s;affected, in parliament, made u&s;e of this di&s;a&s;ter. Private meetings of
the great ones were held, with the pre&s;byterians, who were ever ready to
di&s;turb monarchy.</P>
<P>The earl of Northumberland and Leice&s;ter, lord Hollis, and another,
met at Guilford. They made it no &s;ecret. Northumberland, at St.
James's, talked freely to the duke of York, again&s;t the chancellor,
who was hated, and of the re&s;olution to impeach him; but &s;aid, that
was not all, the nation would not be &s;atified, unle&s;s the guards were
di&s;banded, and other grievances redre&s;&s;ed. He talked very &s;editiou&s;ly,
though the duke checked him. The earl told him, that he had &s;aid
nothing, but what he would repeat to the King the next day; as he did,
with in&s;olence enough. The duke urged, in vain, the nece&s;&s;ity of the
guards, for the King's &s;afety, and national quiet; that the want of them
had been fatal to the late King and his government. The &s;editious
&s;tuck to their point, and joined with the chancellor's enemies; hoping
that his impeachment would breed a quarrel, between the King and the
duke of York.</P>
<P>The King took the &s;eals from the chancellor. He told the duke of
York of the re&s;olution; that it was not out of any di&s;&s;atisfaction with
the chancellor, but the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs; and that it was better to
do it of him&s;elf than let it be torn from him by the parliament. He
ordered the duke to tell him, that he mu&s;t &s;end the &s;eals; and, to &s;hew
his regard for him, he would confirm the little private pen&s;ion he u&s;ually
received. The chancellor &s;ent the &s;eals; and told the duke of York,
that his enemies would not &s;top there, but proceed to the la&s;t degree
to expo&s;e the King and crown, to accompli&s;h his ruin. So it proved.</P>
<P>The parliament met, on the tenth of October. Sir T. Littleton
moved thanks to the King, for his &s;peech and for taking the great &s;eal
<PB N="39" REF="49">
from Clarendon; and to con&s;ider the heads of the King's and the lord
keeper's &s;peeches. The clau&s;e about Clarendon would hardly have
pa&s;&s;ed, had not the King ordered his &s;ervants to let it be known he de|&s;ired
it; and Clarendon charged his friends not to oppo&s;e it, being re|&s;olved
to let none of his private concerns di&s;turb the King's affairs.
The &s;ame means were u&s;ed, in the hou&s;e of lords, when they were moved
to join in the addre&s;s, el&s;e it had not pa&s;&s;ed there. When it came to a
vote, the duke of York and &s;everal others withdrew, not to oppo&s;e the
King, as they looked on it, as an ill precedent for the crown.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;ixth of October, the chancellor was accu&s;ed, on pub|lic
&s;ame; and a committee was appointed to con&s;ider of proceedings
and precedents. That very day, the duke of York, in di&s;cour&s;e with
the King, about the talk of Clarendon's advi&s;ing him to govern by an
army and lay a&s;ide parliaments; the King a&s;&s;ured him, that he had
never given him &s;uch advice. His enemies con&s;idered not public good,
but private malice; and, getting to the head of affairs, give the King
and crown a fatal blow. The King &s;oon found the effects. The duke
of York was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox, in the beginning of November;
and before his recovery the heat of the pro&s;ecution was over, el&s;e he
would have been charged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> with influencing the lords not to impri&s;on
Clarendon. Buckingham and lord Berkeley were &s;o malicious, as, in
their common di&s;cour&s;e, to in&s;inuate, that the King was in danger, by
letting his brother have his own guards to wait on him&s;elf at Whitehall;
none knowing what the duke might be prevailed on to do, by the chan|cellor
and his duche&s;s. Some pre&s;byterians &s;ent to Clarendon, offering
to &s;tand by him, if he would &s;tand by him&s;elf. He &s;aw their malice;
and the King, apprehending heats in the hou&s;e of commons, &s;ent to him
to withdraw out of the realm privately. Clarendon, as the duke was
recovering, &s;ent him word of the me&s;&s;age and his re&s;olution to obey it.
The pre&s;byterians were very angry, at his di&s;appointing them.</P>
<P>Thus fell the earl of Clarendon; from who&s;e fall one may date the
beginning of all the misfortunes, which happened &s;ince, and the decay
of the authority of the crown; he generally &s;upporting that prerogative,
which his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors never minded. He was a private gentleman of a
good family, bred in the law, had good &s;en&s;e, and very eloquent; al|ways
<PB N="40" REF="50">
e&s;teemed for his good parts. He was cho&s;en by the late King a
private manager for him in the hou&s;e of commons, which he per|formed,
with great dexterity and fidelity. He was intru&s;ted, at court,
with the mo&s;t &s;ecret affairs; for his &s;ervices, made chancellor of the
Exchequer; one of the council to the prince of Wales; relied on and
went with him to France. He was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador, with Collington,
then lord trea&s;urer, to Spain. He returned to the King, at Paris; and
was made his fir&s;t mini&s;ter. He had the management of the re&s;toration,
with Monk and Sandwich. At the re&s;toration, he was in &s;uch favour
with the King, that no body dur&s;t oppo&s;e him. He carried all before
him. He made his friend, Southampton, trea&s;urer; and, by the aid of
the duke of Ormonde and the bi&s;hops, was care&s;&s;ed by mo&s;t. As to the
crown, he let the court of Wards and Purveyance be parted with. But
he did not get a good &s;ub&s;tantial revenue &s;ettled on the crown, though
it might have been ea&s;ily done, in the fir&s;t parliament, which the King
called. This was out of fear, that the crown &s;hould grow too great and
the Roman Catholic religion be brought in, if the King was at his ea&s;e;
the duke of Ormonde and Daniel O'Neile having, in the King's journey
to Spain, ob&s;erved him inclined to it.</P>
<P>The new mini&s;try, to gain popularity, at the expence of the crown,
relea&s;ed &s;everal dangerous men; all avowed republicans and old officers
of Cromwel's army. Of the&s;e was major Wildman, who had oppo&s;ed
all the &s;everal governments, colonel Salmon, Mr. Creed, Mr. Bremen
and others; men of good &s;en&s;e, who had great credit with the common
men and di&s;banded officers of the rebel army, and who&s;e confinement
the duke of Albemarle advi&s;ed, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of
the government, they only wanting an opportunity to overturn it. They
had &s;till plots on foot, though di&s;covered by the duke of Albemarle,
and &s;ome executed for de&s;igned ri&s;ings, as Rymer, Tong and others, in
the North; others for murdering the King, as one Bradford or Bradley
and others, in Tothilfields, at the review of a militia regiment.</P>
<P>Clarendon being removed, his enemies divided; each pretending to
&s;uccced, in the mini&s;try. Sir William Coventry, without who&s;e help Buck|ingham
and Arlington could not have carried on the plot, expected it,
and was the only man fit for it. But the other two joining again&s;t him,
<PB N="41" REF="51">
though of the be&s;t capacity of any in the kingdom, got him out of all
his employments; and then &s;trove who &s;hould have mo&s;t credit with the

<P>After the chancellor's removal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1668.</NOTE> the mini&s;ters di&s;agreed among them|&s;elves.
Sir William Coventry was turned out of all his employments,
by Bucks and lord Arlington. They all joined to le&s;&s;en the duke of
York's intere&s;t with the King, le&s;t he &s;hould get Clarendon recalled.
When the duke recovered of the &s;mall-pox, he gave, in the hou&s;e of
lords, his rea&s;ons, for voting again&s;t Clarendon's impeachment; becau&s;e
no proof was made of any of the crimes laid to his charge. The King
was, on this account, colder to the duke. The malicious in&s;inuations
of his enemies were fruitle&s;s. The chancellor's friends were removed.
Wildman and others were relea&s;ed. The duke of Ormonde was re|moved.
Bucks and Arlington labour to &s;upplant one another. The
duke of York's enemies, Bucks and Bri&s;tol, would divorce the King
from the Queen, al&s;o the republican party. Bri&s;tol goes, <HI>incog.</HI> to Par|ma
to find out a new wife for the King, among the duke of Parma's
daughters. The duke of York cautioned the King again&s;t it. Lord
Roos's divorce was carried on in parliament, for a precedent.</P>

<P>They fell on &s;everal of the chancellor's relations and friends. They
got &s;ome removed, and others &s;u&s;pended, from waiting. They brought
in their own creatures, many of them not fit for their employments.
The duke of Buckingham got leave to buy the duke of Albemarle's
po&s;t of ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; which before, when any had a mind to
treat for it, was refu&s;ed, on pretence, that it was not proper for the old
general to quit it. Secretary Morris not being a man for their turn,
Buckingham and Arlington joined to bring in Trevor, a creature of
theirs, though not proper for &s;uch a place of tru&s;t; having only been
acquainted with matters of &s;tate under Oliver Cromwell, with whom
he had been very great. This &s;candalized loyal men very much. But
the two new mini&s;ters minded not much what was &s;aid of them; and
<PB N="42" REF="52">
they got the King to pay for the change, though money was hard
enough to be got. This being done, they began to think of removing
Ormonde from the lord-lieutenancy of Ireland. 'Twas the earl of Orery
who fir&s;t put Buckingham on it; which earl was famous for changing
parties &s;o often, and for making a &s;peech to Cromwell, to take the title
of King. His tongue was well hung. He had &s;ome good parts; and
he was reckoned &s;o cunning a man, that nobody would tru&s;t him or
believe what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>ARLINGTON, at fir&s;t, would not join with them, again&s;t his friend,
the duke of Ormonde; but, at la&s;t, they threatened him into it. The earl
of Angle&s;ey, who then was, or lately had been, vice-trea&s;urer of Ireland,
and who had no great kindne&s;s for Ormonde, hoping, by that means,
to frighten him to join with them in it, to &s;ave him&s;elf, which he did.
Though he had been an old rebel, he was very in&s;trumental in the re|&s;toration;
and was, therefore, made an earl. There might be &s;ome
rea&s;on for their accu&s;ation of mi&s;management of the revenue, by not
paying the troops and the civil li&s;ts &s;o regularly as they ought, and not
minding the government duly; yet the method of proceeding again&s;t
him was very irregular and &s;candalous; e&s;pecially to &s;ee one, who had

</LETTER></NOTE> The duke of York took his part; look|ing
<PB N="43" REF="53">
on all that was laid to his charge, as fal&s;e and malicious, and know|ing
the malice of his accu&s;ers and their de&s;igns of getting all loyal men
laid a&s;ide; and putting in tho&s;e, who had been otherwi&s;e or could be
ab&s;olutely depended upon. They, at la&s;t, gained their point, with re|gard
to the duke of Ormonde; and lord Roberts, who had been an old
rebel, was &s;ent in his room.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="54">
This &s;o encouraged them, that they believed they &s;hould carry all
before them; and jealous, that the duke of York might cro&s;s their de|&s;igns
&s;ooner or later, and that he would not forgive them what they had
done to chancellor Hyde, did all they could to mi&s;repre&s;ent him to the
King, and to make the King jealous of him; and not prevailing with the
King, who knew his brother too well, they did all they could to pro|voke
the duke to do &s;ome warm thing even to them, that they might
have a &s;ubject to complain of him. They endeavoured to mortify him
&s;everal ways. Some of their friends talked of taking the Admiralty
from him, his troop of hor&s;e guards and regiment of foot; and, by un|derhand
means, endeavoured to per&s;uade the King to be divorced from
the Queen as barren, and get another wife. They di&s;cour&s;ed with law|yers
about it, and got divines to write of its lawfulne&s;s; in which con|curred
the earl of Bri&s;tol, another enemy of the duke's on Clarendon's
account, who was &s;o zealous in it, that he went privately into Italy, to
&s;ee if there were any prince&s;&s;es there fit to be propo&s;ed to the King.
Others were, even then, for propo&s;ing to the King to own the duke of
Monmouth.</P>
<P>The earls of Carli&s;le and Shafte&s;bury were the per&s;ons who gave this
advice. But the duke of York knew not, that it was the&s;e two earls
that propo&s;ed it to the King, till the King told it to him; about the time
of the Rye-hou&s;e con&s;piracy. The duke, adverti&s;ed of the de&s;igns of
his enemies, and finding that he had not credit enough with the King
<PB N="45" REF="55">
to take public notice of it, or to have &s;uch ill men continued no longer
in his confidence, hoped, by patience, to weather the &s;torm, and give
his enemies no advantage. They &s;eeing it, took all advantages of
mortifying him, almo&s;t in every thing; but e&s;pecially in what concerned
the admiralty. They hoped, to weary him out of it, by ob&s;tructing
whatever he propo&s;ed, though ever &s;o fit or rea&s;onable; and getting
&s;ome of their own creatures into employment there, whether the duke
would or no. They, got Sir T. O&s;borne<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Well known, under the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive titles of the lord Latimer, earl of Danby, marquis of Caermarthen, and duke of Leeds. The duke afterwards recommended this O&s;borne, whom he blames, to be lord-trea&s;urer, upon the re&s;ignation of Clifford. It ought to be ob&s;erved, that all the&s;e &s;ecret intrigues, mentioned by the duke, have been hitherto ut|terly unknown to the public. They throw light on a period little under&s;tood.</NOTE> and Sir T. Littleton made
trea&s;urers of the navy; the fir&s;t was Buckingham's friend, and the la&s;t
Arlington's; without &s;o much as &s;peaking, or making the lea&s;t applica|tion
to the duke. Though the place and all patent offices are not in
the admiral's gift, yet, by him they are recommended, and he gives his
warrant to the attorney-general, to prepare the bill for the King's &s;ign|ing.
The King ordered the duke to &s;ign it for them, without their or
their friends making the lea&s;t application to him. This ob&s;tructed Sir
Jeremy Smith from being made a commi&s;&s;ioner of the navy for &s;ome
time, though an old &s;ea commander, and ab&s;olutely the fitte&s;t man in
England for it.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e mini&s;ters joined in mortifying the duke of York, they
did not agree well together, each pretending, to have the greate&s;t intere&s;t
with the King; and they took all means to ruin one another. To this
end, Bucks &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the duke, by the earl of Berks, one of his
great confidents, to offer his &s;ervice to him, in the beginning of Decem|ber;
and made great prote&s;tations of what he would do for him. The
duke an&s;wered, that Buckingham had &s;everal times made profe&s;&s;ions, but
never had performed or kept his word; &s;o that he could not tru&s;t him.
Be&s;ides, it would do Buckingham no good, and him&s;elf harm; by af|fording
Arlington an opportunity to repre&s;ent to the King, that, as &s;oon
as the duke &s;aw the King withdraw his favour from any of the mini&s;ters,
he joined with them. He looked on it too as below him, to join or
meddle with any of their cabals; his bu&s;ine&s;s being, to &s;erve the King in
<PB N="46" REF="56">
his own way. Le&s;t Buckingham &s;hould make any &s;tory or mi&s;repre&s;en|tation
of this, the duke gave the King an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed;
but did not name the me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>Buckingham and lord Francis Villiers were bred up, with the King
and the duke of York, at Richmond. They were both hand&s;ome, pro|per
men; but unlike to one another, both in face and temper. When
the rebellion broke out, they were &s;ent to travel; and, as I remember,
returned not back to England till the King was made a pri&s;oner. Their
fir&s;t appearance in action was with the earl of Holland, in a ri&s;ing for the
King, in 1648, near King&s;ton on the Thames; where they were routed
by Sir Miles Live&s;ey, L. Francis &s;lain, Holland taken, and the whole
party di&s;per&s;ed. Buckingham e&s;caped beyond &s;ea and joined the prince;
who, being bred up together, had almo&s;t a natural inclination for him.
When he came to the crown, he gave him the garter, made him gentle|man
of the bedchamber, and was glad of any occa&s;ion to &s;hew him kind|ne&s;s.
He took him with him, in all his journeys, from Holland to
France; from Jer&s;ey back, through France, to Holland and Scotland.
Here he fir&s;t began to &s;hew his true temper. For, notwith&s;tanding the
King's extraordinary kindne&s;s to him, he &s;ided with the marquis of
Argyle; who, at the King's fir&s;t arrival, had all the power in his hands,
again&s;t the loyal party; and when the King had made an agreement,
with his old friends, to e&s;cape from Argyle and head them, Bucking|ham
refu&s;ed to follow him. The King intru&s;ted him with &s;ome papers,
which he could not carry with him, and &s;ealed them up; charging him
not to open them. But Buckingham, without any regard to the King's or|ders,
opened them. All which the King pa&s;&s;ed over and took him along
with him to Worce&s;ter, from whence he e&s;caped, as well as the King,
to France, where the King continued as kind to him as ever.</P>
<P>He &s;tayed &s;ome years in France; and finding friends among the govern|ment
of England, to go over thither, the King con&s;ented. But he had
no &s;ooner arrived, than he made his court to Oliver Cromwell, by pro|po&s;ing
to marry one of his daughters. He railed and talked &s;lightingly
of the King; and profe&s;&s;ed, that he de&s;ired nothing more, than to ven|ture
his life again&s;t Charles Stuart, as he then called him. This was to
ingratiate him&s;elf with Oliver Cromwell, though it had the contrary
effect. When a friend of Buckingham's &s;aid this to Cromwell, he re|plied,
<PB N="47" REF="57">
that he would never give his daughter to one, who could be &s;o
ungrateful to the King; (Oliver Cromwell always calling the King &s;o
whenever he named him) he owing all he had to the family. Having
failed there, he, with much ado, got lord Fairfax's daughter. The&s;e
actions were enough to give the King an ill opinion of him, which he
&s;hewed at his fir&s;t coming into England, after the re&s;toration. When
the King came to Canterbury, where he fir&s;t formed his council, Buck|ingham
was the only man, of tho&s;e who had the honour beyond &s;ea, that
was not called to it. But this mortification did not la&s;t long. He had
&s;o great an a&s;cendant over the King, and being plea&s;ant in his conver&s;a|tion,
that he was brought into the privy council; and, by degrees, into
the King's tru&s;t and confidence. But being of ill principles, he abu&s;ed
the King's goodne&s;s, and joined with factious people again&s;t the crown,
on &s;everal occa&s;ions. He affected popularity, which he could not ob|tain,
by his too airy wit and lewdne&s;s; and to be fir&s;t mini&s;ter, for
which he wanted &s;teddine&s;s and application. The duke of York advi&s;ed
him not to aim at what he was neither fit for nor could obtain; and to
be content with the King's favour<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">What follows, to the end of the paragraph, &s;eems to have been written long after the re&s;t.</NOTE>. But he would not follow it, nor
that of his friends about his e&s;tate, 20,000 l. a-year, at the re&s;toration,
which he &s;quandered; and, before he died, none would tru&s;t him or
credit a word he &s;aid. King James, at his acce&s;&s;ion, was forced to give
a 1000 l. a-year to his wife, for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>It was lucky for the duke of York, that, at this time, Sir W. Ar|mourer,
a truly hone&s;t man, very &s;tout, who had been e&s;quire to Charles
the Fir&s;t, and had &s;erved as an officer all the war, and followed the King
in exile, came bluntly to him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The King.</NOTE>, and, in the pre&s;ence of three or four of
his bedchamber, &s;aid he had heard &s;trange news in the country, where
it was warmly reported, that the King intended to di&s;band his brother's
troop of guards and regiment of foot. The rea&s;ons were, that he had
&s;o much di&s;obliged the King already, that it was not &s;afe to let the duke
have &s;uch a body of men under his command; and he mu&s;t &s;ecure him|&s;elf
from him, by putting it out of his power to revenge him&s;elf: That
the&s;e and &s;uch damned di&s;cour&s;es were all over the country. To which
<PB N="48" REF="58">
the King replied, it was the greate&s;t lye in the world; that it had never
entered into his head; and, on the contrary, that he had all the kind|ne&s;s
in the world for his brother; and were he ma&s;ter of more king|doms
than he had, he would tru&s;t them all in his hands, &s;uch was his
confidence in him. Sir W. Armourer added, he heard it reported, that
he de&s;igned to have the duke of Monmouth declared legitimate. A
thought, he &s;aid, which never entered into his head; that he abhorred
it, and would endeavour to find out the authors of &s;o villainous a report,
and have them puni&s;hed. The&s;e di&s;cour&s;es of the King, however, did
not hinder the party to carry on their de&s;igns; and to in&s;inuate the&s;e
thoughts into Monmouth, who &s;wallowed the poi&s;on very eagerly.</P>
<P>About this time, the duke of York di&s;cour&s;ed with the King, if he
continued in the &s;ame mind, as to his religion; who a&s;&s;ured him he did,
and de&s;ired nothing more than to be reconciled. About the end of De|cember,
he con&s;ulted lord Arundel of Wardour, lord Bella&s;is, Arling|ton,
and Sir Thomas Clifford, about it, who met Jan. 25, 1669; yet
Arlington and others oppo&s;ed the duke of York, as to the navy.</P>
<P>Sir William Coventry gave up his place, under the duke of York,
when he joined in impeaching Clarendon, with Sir Thomas O&s;borne,
lieutenant-colonel Howard, Mr. Seymour, lord Vaughan, by Bucking|ham;
Sir Thomas Littleton, Sir R. Temple, and Sir R. Car, by Ar|lington.
Fearing the duke of York would get Clarendon recalled, the
bill of bani&s;hment was brought in, by the King's leave. Shafte&s;bury
made u&s;e of it, in Sir Thomas Bend's ca&s;e. Buckingham, by his ill
conduct, lo&s;t all credit with the King. Arlington was a weak man and,
with his pride, very timorous; yet had cur&s;ed cunning. He was &s;up|ported
by Sir Thomas Clifford, a man of good &s;en&s;e, bold and gene|rous,
whom he had once obliged. He pre&s;erved him&s;elf &s;ome years;
but was laid a&s;ide, by degrees. Sir Orlando Bridgman was an hone&s;t,
but a weak man. To pave the way for the divorce, a bill was brought
into the hou&s;e, to give leave for lord Roos to marry; his wife being
divorced for adultery. This was to &s;erve as a precedent for the King.
It was much pu&s;hed by the party; and, with much ado, pa&s;&s;ed. The
King promoted it. But it was the ab&s;ent proxies, and not the pre&s;ent
lords, who carried it. The fir&s;t were forty-one, again&s;t thirty-nine; but
it was carried by the proxies. Of eighteen bi&s;hops, only two voted for
<PB N="49" REF="59">
it. One of tho&s;e was governed by his coun&s;el, Sir Gilbert Gerard; and
the other was a dei&s;t.</P>
<P>Buckingham and Bri&s;tol were great promoters of the divorce. They
&s;aid, if the duke of York could be per&s;uaded to it, he would be laughed
at and de&s;pi&s;ed by all the world; if he oppo&s;ed it, they hoped it would
ruin him with the King. Doctor Burnet, a bu&s;y, intriguing man, was
one of the divines who wrote for it; and Sir Orlando Bridgman was
con&s;ulted about it. The King &s;aid that, if his con&s;cience would allow
him to divorce the Queen, it would &s;uffer him to di&s;patch her out of the
world. Northumberland, Leice&s;ter, Hollis, Pierpont, On&s;low, and
others met at Guilford about it. Trevanion propo&s;ed di&s;banding an
hundred of the three troops of hor&s;e guards, and twenty of each com|pany
of foot. But the duke of York and Albemarle prevented it.
They endeavoured to get an addre&s;s, to put the duke out of the admi|ralty,
and put in others more acceptable to them; but it was dropt.
Sir R. Temple brought in a bill for a triennial parliament. Lady Her|vey,
daughter of lord Montague, a very witty and intriguing <HI>wench,</HI>
got well with Buckingham and Arlington; and brought lord Trevor
to be &s;ecretary.</P>

<P>In May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> Buckingham bought the place of ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; giv|ing

Prince Rupert had a mind to it, &s;ome years before, and they had almo&s;t

lord Arlington, and Sir Thomas Clifford, at the duke's clo&s;et, to advi&s;e
on the methods to advance the Cath, religion, in his kingdoms. They
met, on 25 of January. The King declared his mind, in matters of
religion, with great zeal to the duke and other three per&s;ons, at this
private meeting. The re&s;ult of the con&s;ultation was, that the work
&s;hould be done in conjunction with France. The lord Arundel was ac|cordingly
&s;ent to treat with the French King; and the treaty was concluded
the beginning of the year 1670. The French King was to give 200,000<HI>l.</HI>
a year. Plymouth, Hull, Port&s;mouth, placed in faithful hands. The
troops were well affected. The D. of Buckingham &s;eeks to &s;upport him|&s;elf,
by favour of madame, with whom he manages a treaty with France.
He &s;ent over Sir Ellis Leighton to treat with her. Neither the duke nor
Arlington knew any thing of this treaty. The duke, after Leighton's
return, had an account of it from him&s;elf. Nor were the generality of
the church of England men, at that time, aver&s;e to the R. C. religion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King kept the &s;ecret of his agreement with
France, and &s;uffered a mock-treaty to go on, that he might the better
cover the real one; of which neither madame nor the duke of Bucking|ham
had the lea&s;t knowledge. Buckingham's chief drift was to keep

him&s;elf at the head of the mini&s;try. This management of the mock|treaty
was kept a &s;ecret to the D. of York and Arlington.</P>

de&s;ired to do; which was now made ea&s;y for her, by his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
Maje&s;ty's coming to view his new conque&s;ts in Flanders. This journey
proved unfortunate in many re&s;pects. The private treaty had been, as
has been mentioned, already &s;igned by both the Kings, and &s;ome of
the money paid. The French King, being de&s;irous to change the mea|&s;ures
taken in the private treaty, &s;ent her to per&s;uade her brother to
begin with the Dutch war. He was formerly aver&s;e to her journey;
and mon&s;ieur, for rea&s;ons of his own. She very willingly undertook
this commi&s;&s;ion, hoping to ingratiate her&s;elf with that King, and to be
more con&s;idered in France, by &s;hewing the power &s;he had with the K.
her brother. She had, indeed, a mind to &s;tay in England, not only out
of love to her brother, but &s;he pre&s;umed upon his temper and the a&s;|cendant
&s;he had over him; and believed, that if once &s;he could com|pa&s;s

fore&s;aw the ill-con&s;equences of her coming, and did not like it; and as

almo&s;t hinder it. The duke being detained at London, madame, be|fore
his arrival at Dover, had already prevailed on the King to break

which was not likely to be in a good humour; and that they would not
give &s;ufficient &s;upplies for a war undertaken without their advice, and
in conjunction with France. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, they would not approve
of it; and it would give them a jealou&s;y of the King's de&s;igns. His
Maje&s;ty an&s;wered, that fifty of his own &s;hips, and thirty from France,
would &s;erve for the war. So that there was no danger of running in
debt. The charge might ea&s;ily be &s;upported by the cu&s;toms, e&s;timated
at 600,000 <HI>l.</HI> and, if the war &s;ucceeded, it was not much matter what
people &s;u&s;pected. The duke &s;aid, though fifty &s;hips might not co&s;t

eighty &s;hips, &s;uch as propo&s;ed, and fire &s;hips proportionable; and keep

eighteen &s;hips again&s;t the Algerines; and were for Sir Robert

<P>De Ruyter, with &s;eventy Dutch men of war, goes to &s;ea, before the

of the French failing from Bre&s;t, and judging, by the winds, they
mu&s;t be in the channel, failed for the Buoy at the Nore, with the &s;hips
that were ready, fourty, and twelve fire-&s;hips; and was carried, by a

of the &s;ands, he &s;tood to the &s;outh; and, at the night-fall, the gale
growing fre&s;her, and bad weather likely, came to an anchor all night.
The duke giving, at day-break, the &s;ignal for failing, the wind from

Dutch fleet, and join the re&s;t of his own.</P>
<P>The duke of York, in the Prince, of a hundred guns, commanded
the red &s;quadron; Sir Edward Sprag, in the London, of a hundred
guns, was his vice admiral; Sir George Harman, in the Charles, his
rear admiral. Comte d'E&s;trees, vice admiral of the French, in the St.
Philips, between eighty and ninety guns, commanded the white; M. du
Quatre his vice admiral, la Robinier his rear admiral. The earl of Sand|wich,
in the Royal James, a hundred guns, was admiral of the blue;
Sir Jo&s;eph Jordan, in the Sovereign of a hundred guns, was his vice
admiral; and Sir J. Kemp&s;horn, in the St. Andrew of ninety odd guns,
his rear admiral. The duke found, by &s;everal &s;hips from the river, that
the Dutch, whom he &s;ought on their own coa&s;t, lay behind the Rumble
Sand, in order to draw the Engli&s;h on it. But captain R. Haddock
prevented it. Captain Cook confirmed the intelligence; and the &s;couts
that were &s;ent experienced it. The duke then &s;tood in, towards the
banks of Flanders. De Ruyter, the be&s;t &s;ea commander of his time,
&s;tood in to the banks. He was bred under old Van Tromp. His good
&s;en&s;e was only equalled by his courage. He managed his fleet &s;o, that
the duke could not engage, for a long time, without di&s;advantage. His
&s;hips drew le&s;s water. The weather being very bad, the duke went to
Southwold bay; and the &s;hips that wanted water and provi&s;ions anchored
near the &s;hore; as the fire-&s;hips did, to take in fre&s;h balla&s;t. The duke
declared, when the wind turned to the ea&s;t, that he would get out to
&s;ea; ordering that no coallier or trading &s;hip &s;hould be permitted to go
round; left falling into the hands of the enemy's privateers, they might
lie adverti&s;ed how his fleet lay. Yet a light coallier &s;lipt by, in the
night, and was taken by a privateer and carried to de Ruyter; who, on
the wind's turning ea&s;t, ordered his fleet to fail at &s;un-&s;et, in order to

to be in a po&s;ture to receive the Dutch; and ordered Sir J. Cox, his
captain, to give the &s;ignal for the fleet to do &s;o, and to be in the order
of battle. Cox urged, that there was no danger of the enemy's com|ing
on &s;o &s;oon; their fleet being in the &s;ame condition with ours, taking
in &s;tores and provi&s;ions: that captain Finch, one of our cruizers, come
newly in from the coa&s;t of Holland, had brought no news of their mo|tion.
The ma&s;ter of the packet-boat, who was ju&s;t come in, being
brought to the duke, informed him, that he came, the evening be|fore,
through the Dutch fleet, lying at anchor off Goree; the mo&s;t of
them with their yards and topma&s;ts down, taking in all &s;orts of pro|vi&s;ions.
So that it was not likely, that they could &s;oon be in a &s;ailing
condition; and that the duke might he twenty-four hours longer, for
&s;upplying his fleet with what they wanted; which could not be done in
&s;everal days, if he &s;tood out further from the &s;hore. This was con|firmed
by the French major and captain Eliot, his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, who were
appointed to take in water and other nece&s;&s;aries for the French &s;quadron.
Thus was the duke of York over-per&s;uaded to tarry where he was; and
Cox was &s;o &s;ure, that he brought his &s;hip, the Prince, on the careen, to
give her a pair of boot-ho&s;e-tops, to make her &s;ail the better.</P>
<P>Thus, on the twenty-eighth of May, was the duke of York &s;urprized,
about two in the morning. The captain of a French fourth rate, who
had been with captain Finch cruizing on the coa&s;t of Holland, brought
him the fir&s;t news of the Dutch approach. His &s;hip, being a bad &s;ailer,
could not go in as Finch's did to the fleet, the evening before; and, that
he might not be driven to the leeward of it, he was forced to come to
an anchor, about a league to the ea&s;tward of the fleet; the wind being
north-ea&s;t, and a leeward tyde. This gave quicker knowledge of the
enemy. For, as he was getting under &s;ail to join the fleet, two Dutch
&s;couts fell in with him, and, though of equal force, did not fire upon
him, but brought to and &s;tood from him; which made him judge their
fleet was not far a &s;tern of them. By way of &s;ignal to give notice of
<PB N="62" REF="72">
the enemy's approach, he fired all the way as he &s;tood in to join the
Engli&s;h fleet, which made it prepare to receive the Dutch. At day|break
the Dutch fleet was &s;een to windward, bearing down on us. The
&s;hips of the line and fire-&s;hips, which were nearer in with the &s;hore than the
flag-men, at the fir&s;t alarm got under &s;ail to place them in their &s;tations,
in the order of battle; but, by rea&s;on of the leeward tyde and ea&s;t wind,
few could get in, when the engagement began. Not above twenty of
the red and blue bore the brunt of de Ruyter and Van Ghent's &s;qua|drons.
The fight began about eight in the morning; the Dutch having
the wind. The Prince was di&s;abled. The duke of York went then on
board the St. Michael, Sir Robert Holmes captain. The French &s;qua|dron
was &s;carce charged, by the Zealand &s;quadron. The earl of Sand|wich's
&s;hip, the Royal James, was burnt; but captain Haddock was
&s;aved. Two &s;hips, which came to burn the Prince, were &s;unk. The
duke, returning to refit, was followed by the Dutch, in bravado; but
turning on them again, he pur&s;ued them to their own coa&s;ts, and left
fifteen of their di&s;abled &s;hips in the rear, which nothing, but a &s;udden
fog, could have &s;aved from being taken. Foul weather hindered him,
afterwards, from attacking them, till on their own coa&s;ts.</P>

<P>De Ruyter had a hard game to play.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpher&s;on's Extracts.</NOTE> He was obliged to keep to &s;ea,
&s;o to &s;upport the drooping &s;pirits of his countrymen, and to hinder the
de&s;erting of his men, and their getting the &s;ame panic in the fleet, that
prevailed a&s;hore. Had he not been qualified, as he was, he could not
&s;o well have fenced again&s;t all his difficulties, as he did. He was, in|deed,
ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the greate&s;t &s;ea-commander of his time. He was
bred up under old Van Tromp; and had been in all or mo&s;t of the chief
engagements of the two fir&s;t Dutch wars. He had very good &s;en&s;e,
equal to his courage, which appeared, upon this occa&s;ion, in &s;o managing
his fleet, that although they were &s;o near one another, for &s;o long a
time, the duke could not come to an engagement; without great di&s;ad|vantage
and hazard to his own fleet. For he po&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o advan|tageou&s;ly
for his own fleet, that drew le&s;s water than ours, near the coa&s;t
of Flanders, and &s;erved him&s;elf &s;o well of the weather, which was fa|vourable
to him, that the duke neither could attack him in the morning,
<PB N="63" REF="73">
&s;o to make a deci&s;ive battle of it, nor far enough off from the &s;ands,
with which they were better acquainted than we were.</P>
<P>Before the battle, in Southwold bay, began, the duke gave orders,
that no one &s;hould mention aloud the coming of a fire-&s;hip, for fear of
di&s;compo&s;ing the &s;eamen. De Ruyter, after having exchanged &s;ome
broad&s;ides with the duke, &s;ent two fire-&s;hips to clap him aboard. Sir
Edward Scot, a land-officer, fir&s;t di&s;covered the fire-&s;hips. He whi&s;|pered
it to Sir John Cox. But &s;carce had Sir John called an officer to
give him orders thereupon, when a great &s;hot &s;truck him dead, and,
at the &s;ame time, carried off the head of Mr. Bell, a volunteer. Sir
Edward addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the duke, who forthwith gave &s;uch di|rections,
as di&s;patched the fir&s;t &s;ire&s;hip and di&s;abled the other. The duke
with the few &s;hips that were with him, were &s;o plied by De Ruyter,
that his own &s;hip, the Prince, had, before eleven o'clock, her main
top-ma&s;t &s;hot by the board, her fore-top&s;ail, her &s;tarboard main-&s;hrowds,
and all the re&s;t of her rigging and fighting &s;ails torn to pieces, and above
200 of the crew either killed or wounded. He went down, as between
decks, to order &s;omething, he &s;tept into his boat, having previou&s;ly
given private orders to the captain to tow the Prince out of the line.
The lord Duras, Mr. Henry Savil, Mr. A&s;hton, and his chief pilot, accom|panied
him. He went on board the St. Michael, a &s;econd rate, com|manded
by Sir Robert Holmes, that was a-head of him, &s;omewhat to the
leeward; and, for that rea&s;on, had not been much damaged. He put
up in&s;tantly his flag. But there not being wind enough to &s;pread it, he
was fain to &s;end his boat to give notice where he was. The French,
as I have already &s;aid, &s;tood away to the &s;outhward, as clo&s;e haled as
they could. But they were not pre&s;&s;ed, as they might have been, by the
Zealand &s;quadron.</P>
<P>When the duke was on board the St. Michael, he was obliged to tack,
on account of a &s;and athwart of Leo&s;toff, and &s;tood to the &s;outhward,
as near as he could lie. He weathered, by that means, De Ruyter
and mo&s;t of his &s;quadron. But had the Am&s;terdam &s;quadron &s;till to
windward of him. That &s;quadron had been obliged to tack, for the
&s;ame rea&s;on. The duke was now between two lines of the Dutch; and
forced to lead the &s;hips of his divi&s;ion, that could get into his wake, and
<PB N="64" REF="74">
tack after him; which were not many. The re&s;t tacked to leeward of
De Ruyter; &s;o that the enemy and we were much mingled together.</P>
<P>Soon after the duke had &s;tood to the &s;outhward, a gentle gale &s;prung
up at ea&s;t; and being got clear of the &s;moak, he would look a little
about him. The fir&s;t thing he &s;aw was the E. of Sandwich's blue flag,
&s;ome di&s;tance a-head of him, appearing above the &s;moak, which was &s;o
great about that place, that one could not &s;ee any hulls. Whil&s;t the red
&s;quadron was engaged with De Ruyter and his &s;quadron, the E. of
Sandwich's divi&s;ion was no le&s;s hotly engaged with the &s;quadron of Van
Ghent, who with his &s;hip brought to, on the broad&s;ide of the earl; whil&s;t,
at the &s;ame time, captain Brakel, a bold, hot-headed Dutchman, in a &s;hip
of 70 guns, laid him on board, athwart the hau&s;e; by which means,
raking him fore and aft, they together de&s;troyed him a world of men;
which obliged the earl, that he might get rid of &s;o trouble&s;ome a neigh|bour,
to order his men to enter Brakel's &s;hip. This they did, with &s;words,
half-pikes, and pi&s;tols; and, after &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, they ma&s;tered her.
Though this gave the earl &s;ome ea&s;e, Van Ghent and his &s;econds &s;o
plied his &s;hip, the Royal James, and had &s;lain and di&s;abled &s;o many of
his men, that he was obliged to recal tho&s;e who had ma&s;tered Brakel's
&s;hip.</P>
<P>He immediately &s;ent to a&s;k the advice of his captain, (captain Had|dock)
who having been wounded in the foot, was then dre&s;&s;ing in the
hold. By his advice he came to an anchor, by one fixed for &s;uch acci|dents
out of the gun-room. This had the de&s;ired effect. But it proved,
in part, the de&s;truction of the Royal James. For be&s;ides that &s;he was,
at the very beginning of the engagement, &s;omewhat to windward of her
own divi&s;ion, &s;o by coming then to anchor, they drove farther from
her, and the enemy came nearer to her. At this in&s;tant Van Ghent was
&s;lain, by one of her &s;hot. But that did not hinder the enemy from &s;till
pre&s;&s;ing hard upon her. They &s;ent a fire-&s;hip upon her, which &s;he &s;unk
before &s;he could reach her.</P>
<P>The earl was now no longer at an anchor. For &s;oon after he was
clear of Brakel's &s;hip, he cut the cable that was out of his gun-room.
After which, when he had almo&s;t got clear off from among&s;t the Dutch,
another fire-&s;hip came upon him. He endeavoured to bear up. But
<PB N="65" REF="75">
his &s;hip was &s;o much di&s;abled, that he could not do it; and &s;o the fire|&s;hip
laid her on board to windward, on her larboard &s;ide, and burnt
her. This the duke beheld with &s;orrow. But he could not help,
being to the leeward of her, though he pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by her, and &s;aw
the &s;ea covered with her men; &s;ome &s;inking, &s;ome &s;wimming, and
others buoying them&s;elves up, upon what they could next catch hold
of. Hereupon he ordered the Dartmouth, which was ju&s;t come up to
him, to ly by, and &s;ave all &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could. She and &s;ome of the boats of
the line which followed the duke, made a &s;hift to pick up 2 or 300, of
which number were captain Haddock, lieutenant Mayo, the ma&s;ter, and
one Lowd, a &s;ervant of the E. of Sandwich, whom the King made a
page of the bed-chamber, as &s;oon as he came to London. The earl
was not &s;o fortunate; for he was drowned, and his body being after|wards
found, was honourably buried in Henry the Seventh's chapel.</P>
<P>The duke's &s;hip, the St. Michael, was &s;o leaky, that &s;he now had
five feet of water in her hold. The Phoenix, the Re&s;olution, and the
Cambridge came up &s;ea&s;onably to his relief. Van Ghent's &s;quadron bore
down on the duke. They, however, brought to, and contented them&s;elves
to ply him very hard with their great guns. The rea&s;on was, that the
captain who &s;ucceeded Van Ghent, was killed at fir&s;t, and he who
came next in command had not the re&s;olution to follow his plan. Van
Ne&s;&s;e, the elder, who carried a flag in the main-top, being to leeward
of the duke, after he had tacked, and cut between De Ruyter and the
Am&s;terdam &s;quadron, &s;tretched out a-head with &s;ome of De Ruyter's
&s;quadron; and tacked again and &s;tood &s;tern-lings with the duke; de|&s;igning
to weather him, and bring up &s;ome fire-&s;hips he had with him.
But when the Stavern, one of his &s;econds which led him, had got
up with the broad&s;ide of the duke, Van Ne&s;&s;e's heart failed him; and
in&s;tead of following the &s;hip a-head of him, which was one of fifty
odd guns, commanded by capt. Elzivir, he tacked and &s;tood away, with
his fire-&s;hips. He left the Stavern behind him. She was di&s;abled by
the St. Michael. She at length yielded to the Greenwich, a fourth rate,
captain Green commander.</P>
<P>By this time the St. Michael having &s;o much water again in her hold,
made leeward way; &s;o that the Dutch being al&s;o to the leeward, &s;he at
<PB N="66" REF="76">
la&s;t came within mu&s;ket-&s;hot of their &s;quadron. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by the
Dutch vice admiral's &s;econd, the duke raked her fore and aft.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Spragg, with &s;ome of his divi&s;ion, was now got a-head
of the duke. The E. of O&s;&s;ory, in the Victory, who had till now
kept in his &s;tation, a-&s;tern of the duke, was &s;o di&s;abled, that he was
forced to bear away to refit. Capt. George Legg, in the Fairfax, a third
rate, took his place. It was now five o'clock in the afternoon. Sir
Robert Holmes informed the duke, that the St. Michael was &s;o much
di&s;abled, that &s;he could no longer continue in the line. She had lo&s;t a
great many men. Her &s;ails, ma&s;ts, and rigging were in a &s;hattered con|dition.
She had &s;uch a quantity of water in her hold, that &s;he mu&s;t
have &s;unk, if &s;he did not lie by to &s;top her leaks. The duke re&s;olved to
go on board the London, Sir Edward Spragg's &s;hip. He, at the &s;ame
time, de&s;ired Holmes not to &s;trike the &s;tandard, till he &s;aw it flying
a-board the London, le&s;t the di&s;appearing of it, for any time, might
di&s;courage his own fleet. This was found to be a nece&s;&s;ary precaution:
for, by the fre&s;hening of the gale, the London had got &s;o far a-head,
that it was three quarters of an hour before he got on board her.</P>
<P>When the duke came on board the London, he found her al&s;o much
di&s;abled, e&s;pecially in her head-&s;ails; having had to deal with Van Ne&s;&s;e
the younger, a rear admiral, who was to windward of her. He &s;wagged
apace down upon her. But, at this time, being &s;even in the evening,
De Ruyter made a &s;ignal to all his &s;hips, that were to windward of him,
to bear down to him. He him&s;elf bore away to join the Zealand &s;qua|dron,
who were &s;till engaged with the French. He came down, on the
Rainbow, an old &s;econd rate. Capt. Storer, her commander, obliged
him to &s;tand out a-head of him; De Ruyter not thinking it &s;afe to lay
him on board. This motion of the Dutch gave Sir John Jordan an
opportunity to join the duke with 5 or 6 &s;hips. The duke had now
with him about 25 &s;hips to windward of the Dutch. The re&s;t having
joined the French, were to leeward of the enemy. This was the po|&s;ition
of the fleets at &s;un &s;et: and thus ended this memorable day, in
which the Dutch, with all the advantage they could de&s;ire, of &s;urprize
and wind, and of number of &s;hips that engaged, were far from victory
over the Engli&s;h; as their being the fir&s;t to leave the &s;ea, and retiring into
<PB N="67" REF="77">
their harbours, will hereafter make fully evident. The night was &s;pent
in refitting. The duke went again on board the Prince. In a council
of the flag officers, it was re&s;olved, that the fleet &s;hould return. The
Dutch, out of bravado, following the Engli&s;h, the duke turned upon them,
and pur&s;ued them to their own coa&s;t. The Dutch were &s;aved by a fog.</P>

to intercept the Dutch Ea&s;t India fleet, then expected home by the north
of Scotland, which might otherwi&s;e e&s;cape, whil&s;t the duke looked after
De Ruyter. The duke thought the be&s;t way was to drive De Ruyter
into harbour; becau&s;e, if he was at &s;ea, it would be dangerous to &s;pread
our &s;hips, in order to intercept the Ea&s;t India fleet, le&s;t the enemy &s;hould
come upon them on a &s;udden. For De Ruyter would ea&s;ily know our
&s;tations. The duke cruized between the Vly and the Texel. He an|chored
there, for near a fortnight, in bad weather; and then cruized
towards the Dogger-&s;ands. The Cambridge, one of his cruizers, boarded
an Ea&s;t Indiaman, but it blew &s;o hard, that he could not ma&s;ter her;

<P>The duke of York, in the hou&s;e of lords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1674. Jan. 14th.</NOTE> told them, that the rea&s;on
he had not yet taken the oath of allegiance, was not for any &s;cruple he
had to take it; the meane&s;t &s;ubject his Maje&s;ty had not being readier to
te&s;tify his obedience to him than he was; but he doubted whether he
was to take it, &s;ince it was plain that prince Henry had not done it;
and that, by authentic records, other princes had been exempted from
taking it. Being unwilling to do any thing, that might give rea&s;on to
any who might come after him, and be in the &s;ame po&s;t, to complain,
that he had lo&s;t them a privilege, which he might have retained if he
plea&s;ed; he de&s;ired, for his own ju&s;tification and &s;atisfaction, their opi|nion
and judgment in it. At fir&s;t, it was propo&s;ed to refer it to a
committee of the privy council. But the duke &s;eeing, by the debate,
that many lords were of opinion he ought not to have the &s;ame privilege
as the prince, de&s;ired them not to give them&s;elves the trouble, that he
acqui$&s;ced and would take it; having done his part, in making his
claim; and would not &s;tand upon it. He took it, as &s;oon as the hou&s;e

<P>After the King's me&s;&s;age, about the Dutch offers for peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th.</NOTE> the earl
of Sali&s;bury moved for a bill, to breed the duke of York's children in
the religion of the church of England. The earl of Carli&s;le &s;econded
this motion; and moved further for a bill, that the King, nor none of
the royal blood to &s;uch a degree, might marry, without the con&s;ent of
parliament. Halifax moved, the di&s;arming all Roman Catholics and

The articles of peace with the Dutch were &s;igned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 9th</NOTE> at London, on the

the marquis de Fre&s;no, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, who had full powers
from the Dutch, for that purpo&s;e. Next day, in the debate, in the

blood from marrying a Roman Catholic, without the con&s;ent of parlia|ment,
Carli&s;le and Halifax propo&s;ed, that the penalty &s;hould be the
declaring them incapable of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; for which being reproved
by lord Peterborrow, who termed it &startq;a horrid notion,&endq; he was an|&s;wered
by Shafte&s;bury, that it was not &s;o horrid. He &s;poke for it, he
&s;aid, not as a thing he de&s;ired &s;hould look backward, but forward;
and for which there had been precedents. But his di&s;cour&s;e and prece|dents
were &s;everely an&s;wered by the lord-keeper, who &s;aid it was &s;tretch|ing
their liberty and freedom of &s;peech to the utmo&s;t, to hold &s;uch di&s;|cour&s;e
as they had held. He &s;poke very well and home to the whole
matter, proving it again&s;t law; and he &s;hewed the bad effects things of
that nature had had in this nation. The bi&s;hop of Winton, and other
bi&s;hops, &s;poke, to &s;hew how any thing of the nature was again&s;t the
rules of Chri&s;tianity in general, and e&s;pecially again&s;t the doctrine of the
church of England; and, at la&s;t, the propo&s;ition was laid a&s;ide, with
&s;corn. The heads re&s;olved on were, in general, that the King, nor none
of the blood, within &s;uch a degree, &s;hould marry a papi&s;t, without the

<P>On the twenty-fourth of February,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th</NOTE> the parliament was prorogued, to
the tenth of November. This re&s;olution was carried &s;o clo&s;e, that none of
the Commons believed it would be done, expecting only to be told
of a rece&s;s, in eight or ten days; and they looked very di&s;contented,
when it was done. No bill of any kind had pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es; and
but one private and two public ones were &s;ent up from the hou&s;e of
commons. One of each kind only was &s;ent from the lords. Shafte&s;bury

looking on it as a de&s;ign to do there as he had done in parliament; and
that he would do well to go down to the country, as &s;oon as the weather
would permit. Shafte&s;bury an&s;wered, that he had no de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The duke of York told Monmouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 17th</NOTE> who was with him in the even|ing,
that he feared Arlington. Though he was about to quit the place
of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, for the white &s;taff, he would &s;till have &s;ome part
in affairs; and, by his fearful councils, ruin the King's affairs, as he had
already done. He knew it was his de&s;ign to ruin the good under&s;tand|ing
between them. Monmouth an&s;wered, that he could not believe he
had &s;uch evil intentions, el&s;e he would have nothing to do with him.
The duke of York made him &s;uitable returns and parted; conjuring
him, at the &s;ame time, to have a care of Arlington's practices. The
&s;ame night, after &s;upper, Monmouth came to the duke, and de&s;ired him
to move the King, for his having a commi&s;&s;ion as general, during plea|&s;ure
only; and to liee by him, not to make u&s;e of at pre&s;ent, but in ca&s;e
of any di&s;order. This he de&s;ired, becau&s;e he had been told by &s;ome
officers, that, if any thing &s;hould happen, they could not obey him, nor
fire on any, unle&s;s he had &s;uch authority to command. The duke an|&s;wered,

he was empowered to command all the troops now on foot, as elde&s;t

did, the duke put him in mind, that they could have none, being acci|dentally
drawn up in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, when the di&s;orders began;
and they fell upon the rabble and di&s;per&s;ed that part of them, before
orders could come. Monmouth in&s;i&s;ting on it &s;till, the duke of York
told him plainly, that he would never &s;peak to the King about it, non|con&s;ent
there &s;hould be any general, as it was a po&s;t not fit for any
body in the time of peace; and, on the duke of Albemarle's death, he
had advi&s;ed the King again&s;t it, when there was no thought of a duke
of Monmouth.</P>
<P>The King told the duke of York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 13th.</NOTE> he thought it would be nece&s;&s;ary
for his &s;ervice to give the duke of Monmouth a commi&s;&s;ion for lieute|nant-general,
to capacitate him to command all the troops, el&s;e incon|veniences
might happen, on &s;ome refu&s;ing to obey him, in ca&s;e of a

re&s;olution to the contrary, when the late general died; and, be&s;ides,
there was no nece&s;&s;ity for it, as Monmouth was already captain of the
guards.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT III.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Monmouth had been bred, in France, a Roman Catho|lic,
under father Gough, an Engli&s;h oratorian. His tutor, Thomas
Ro&s;s, a Scot&s;man, put the thoughts of legitimacy into his head; and
would have bi&s;hop Cozens to certify, that he had married the King and
Mrs. Walters, who refu&s;ed it, with indignity, and gave immediate no|tice
of it to the King, who removed Ro&s;s from about him. Mrs.
Walters, for that was her true name, was born of Welch parents, very
hand&s;ome, little wit and &s;ome cunning. Colonel Algernoon Sidney,
who was then a colonel under Oliver Cromwell, trafficked for her fir&s;t;
and was to have had her for fifty broad pieces. This I had from his own
mouth. But, being commanded ha&s;tily out of London to his regiment, he
mi&s;&s;ed her; and the went to Holland, where his brother, Robert Sidney,
lighted on her and kept her, for &s;ome time. The King, being then at the
Hague, heard of her, and got her from him, who &s;aid, at the &s;ame time,
the&s;e words to &s;ome of his friends, &startq;Let who will have her, &s;he is already
&s;ped.&endq; And after her being with the King, &s;he proved &s;o &s;oon with
child, and came &s;o near the time, that the world had cau&s;e to doubt,
who&s;e &s;on Monmouth was<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Macpher&s;on's Extracts.</NOTE>. When he grew a man, he proved the like&s;t
thing to him I ever &s;aw, even to a very wart on his face. After &s;he had this
child, &s;he kept &s;o little mea&s;ure with the King, and lived &s;o loo&s;ely when
he was in Scotland, that when, after the Worce&s;ter fight, he came to
France and &s;he came thither, he would have no further commerce with
her. She u&s;ed, in vain, all her little arts. She tried to per&s;uade
doctor Cozens that &s;he was a convert, and would quit her &s;candalous
way of life; and had, at the &s;ame time, a child, by the earl of Carling|ton,
who grew up to be a woman, and was owned by the mother to be
hers; as like the earl as po&s;&s;ible. When the King went to Germany,
&s;he impo&s;ed on Sir H. V. the King's re&s;ident at Bru&s;&s;els, to go along
with her to Cologne, and a&s;k leave to marry him. But all being in

after the restoration, of the di&s;ea&s;e incident to her profe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>When James was in Ireland, in 1690, he employed &s;ome part of his time in drawing up in&s;tructions for his &s;on. He is very particular, in his advices to him, as to his pri|vate conduct. But he has left only general heads of what he intended to &s;ay, about the government of this country, and the manner of regulating the &s;everal departments, and filling the great offices of &s;tate. He gives very &s;en&s;ible directions about the navy, as the bulwark and glory of the kingdom. He de&s;ires him to have the trea&s;ury always in com|mi&s;&s;ion; never to have a lawyer lord chancellor. To have neither lord high admiral nor commi&s;&s;ioners, but a &s;ecretary of &s;tate, for that department, which always ought to be the chief care, and, therefore, mu&s;t be under the immediate in&s;pection of a King of England. He recommends to him to have four &s;ecretaties of &s;tate; of whom only one, &s;hould the te&s;t be repealed, ought to be a Roman Catholic, one a Pre&s;byterian, and two of the church of England.</P>
<P>He de&s;ires him, in a particular manner, not to be too much attached to women. He gives &s;everal in&s;tances of the fatal con&s;equences of &s;uch connexions to princes, and to their kingdoms. Many of them died without lawful heirs, and were ungratefully u&s;ed by their natural children. He acknowledges, with &s;hame and regret, that he him&s;elf was too much a &s;lave to that pa&s;&s;ion. Almo&s;t every thing, he &s;ays, will apply to his brother, although he profe&s;&s;es, from a regard to his memory, to &s;peak in general terms. He gives him, however, as a &s;trong in&s;tance of the di&s;advantages ari&s;ing from keeping mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Though he u&s;ed them with kindne&s;s and liberality, they had no fixed regard for his per&s;on. The factious and di&s;contented always gained them over to their intere&s;t, which he in&s;tances, in &startq;a certain lady;&endq; by whom he means the duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth. &startq;If you have daughters,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;you will be obliged to give them portions, and to provide them with hu&s;bands, whom you mu&s;t dignify with honours, or enrich with places. If you have &s;ons, you mu&s;t furni&s;h them with e&s;tates out of the deme&s;nes of the crown; and give them employments, to the exclu&s;ion of men of merit, and the ancient nobility, who have a right to your favour.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And now to come to what I have &s;een my&s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the Scotch College, Paris.</NOTE> and what ought to weigh very much with you. The late King, my brother, who had the misfortune to be very much addicted to that fatal vice, had children by all his owned mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and none by his Queen. Be&s;ides which, he had the mortification to have had the duke of Mon|mouth, whom he believed to be his &s;on (though all the knowing world, as well as my|&s;elf, had many convincing rea&s;ons to think the contrary; and that he was Robert Sidney's) fly in his face, and join with the earl of Shafte&s;bury and the factious party, in the de&s;ign they had to &s;eize his per&s;on, and ri&s;e in rebellion again&s;t him; though, at the &s;ame time, he &s;howed him all the tenderne&s;s of a father, and the kindne&s;s of a friend, doing things for him, which ought to have made him give a better return than he did.&endq;</P>

and &s;ucceeded with very many officers and &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>The parliament, not content with &s;tripping the duke of York of his
po&s;ts, by the fir&s;t te&s;t, re&s;olved, by an additional act, to drive him from
the King's pre&s;ence. But they were di&s;appointed. The duke's friends,
in the hou&s;e, moving to exempt him from that part of the penalties,
it was carried by two votes, which came that morning into the hou&s;e,
Sir Charles Gaudy and Sir Anthony Dean. Shafte&s;bury, hearing of it,
declared he did not now care what became of the bill. Yet he left not
off the de&s;ign, but carried it at la&s;t, by the help of the earl of Danby,
the trea&s;urer; who&s;e friend the duke had been before, though it was
again&s;t his will he had been made trea&s;urer of the navy. But &s;eeing him
&s;erve with care and fidelity in the office, he grew his friend; and had &s;o
good an opinion of him and his capacity, that, when Clifford laid down,
he recommended him to the King for trea&s;urer, as the fitte&s;t per&s;on. He
did it very well, and &s;erved the King with great vigour and fidelity, till
he took di&s;ta&s;te at what the King did in favour of Buckingham.</P>
<P>The faction, &s;eeing the King had more friends and intere&s;t in the hou&s;e
of commons than they cared for, thought to break the parliament, on
a nicety of law and cu&s;tom of parliaments. This they de&s;igned to ef|fect
at the fir&s;t meeting of the hou&s;e; and were, &s;ome time before, very
indu&s;trious in going about it, and &s;peaking to lords of all &s;orts to bring
it about; pretending they would prove the parliament di&s;&s;olved. They
&s;ent lord Wharton to the duke of York, who, though of the party,
pretended kindne&s;s for him, out of friend&s;hip and gratitude, the duke
having, &s;ome years before, &s;aved him from being ruined, to endeavour
to per&s;uade him, that the parliament was actually di&s;&s;olved, and give his
rea&s;ons for it. The duke &s;aid, he &s;hould hear tho&s;e rea&s;ons in the de|bate,
<PB N="80" REF="92">
and would judge who &s;poke with mo&s;t rea&s;on. Shafte&s;bury $$d
Hollis &s;poke with Arundel of Wardour, Bella&s;is, and mo&s;t of the Ro|man
Catholic lords, to per&s;uade them to join with them, and $word$
the re&s;t of the Roman Catholics. But they would not comply. The
turbulent party urged their arguments with &s;o much heat and &s;edition,
that Buckingham, Sali&s;bury, Shafte&s;bury, and Wharton were &s;ent by the
lords to the Tower, to remain during the King's, plea&s;ure. But, not long
after, on petitioning the King, and owning the fault, they were relea&s;ed.
Wharton &s;tayed &s;omewhat longer than the re&s;t, becau&s;e he chicaned,
and had no mind to own his fault in plain terms. But, &s;eeing no re|medy,
he did it either in that or the next &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Another great and warm debate happened in the hou&s;e of lords,
on a bill brought in or propo&s;ed by the earl of Danby, and &s;uffered by
the court and epi&s;copal party, by which no peer was to &s;it or vote in
the hou&s;e, that did not take the oaths or te&s;t, not to endeavour any al|teration
in church or &s;tate, as then &s;ettled. The party, e&s;pecially the four
lords who were &s;ent to the Tower, the duke of Monmouth, and Hal|lifax
oppo&s;ed it; and Shafte&s;bury and Hollis pre&s;&s;ed again the two Ro|man
Catholic lords, Arundel of Wardour, and Bella&s;is, to join with
them in oppo&s;ing it, as all the Roman Catholic lords would not agree.
They &s;aid, it was not prudent for any of them to irritate the King, who
might execute the laws again&s;t them, and find means to turn them out
of the hou&s;e; and, perhaps, their party might give a helping hand to
it. Shafte&s;bury &s;wore, he and his friends never would; and wi&s;hed his
tongue might cleave to the roof of his mouth, if he ever &s;pake for &s;o
unju&s;t a thing. Yet not above two or three Roman Catholic lords joined
with the party; and the&s;e, in another debate, propo&s;ed, that an ad|dition
to the &s;tanding rules of the hou&s;e of lords &s;hould be con&s;tantly
read, at the fir&s;t &s;itting of every parliament; declaring that no peer
was to lo&s;e his place or &s;eat in the hou&s;e, by rea&s;on of any oath ten|dered
to him. But, on this, the bill was laid a&s;ide.</P>

<P>The commonwealth party expected, that in this parliament the mi|ni&s;ters

given, without &s;acrificing &s;ome great officer, or parting with &s;ome great
flower of the crown; and, the truth is, the pro&s;pect was di&s;mal enough.
Great di&s;orders were hoped for. Va&s;t crowds of old rump officers and
others were at the opening of it. The four lords probably expected fer|mentations,
or they had not been &s;o re&s;olute. For their friends, in the
hou&s;e of lords, the marquis of Winche&s;ter, the lords Halifax and Hollis
advi&s;ed them not to tru&s;t that point of the parliament being di&s;&s;olved,
by a fifteen months prorogation; telling them they would mi&s;carry in
it, and only bring inconveniences to them&s;elves. Their ill &s;ucce&s;s
frightened their friends and party, that they dur&s;t not fall on the mini|&s;ters;

unle&s;s more vi&s;ibly guilty of &s;ome great mi&s;demeanor, which did not

<P>Otes's plot.&mdash;He had gone to St. Omers, and, under pretence of becom|ing
a je&s;uit, had been admitted into the je&s;uit's college there, till turned
out for in&s;incerity and other crimes; and, enraged at the je&s;uits, he
came into England, and pretended to have di&s;covered a plot, though
never was any thing &s;o improbable. It was founded on &s;uch reports, as
had kindled a rebellion, in 1641. The King was again&s;t communicat|ing
Tong's information to the duke of York, till it was thoroughly
examined. But he came to hear of it, by the letters &s;ent to Mr. Be|dingfield
at Wind&s;or. When Otes was examined, he began his narrative,
with &s;uch a&s;&s;urance, and accompanied it with &s;uch circum&s;tances, as
would have impo&s;ed almo&s;t upon any body. But the cro&s;s examination
&s;hewed the villainy. Otes &s;aid, he knew the hands of tho&s;e, from whom
the pretended letters came; and a line of each being &s;hewed him, he
told who&s;e they were. But there was no &s;imilitude between them and
the papers of Ireland and Fenwick. Ireland was in England, when his
la&s;t letter was dated from St. Omers; and had not, of a long time, been
beyond &s;ea. Tong's depo&s;ition was in the &s;ame hand with Blundel's
<PB N="87" REF="99">
letter. So Tong and Otes were the contrivers. Otes wrote one him|&s;elf.
None of the&s;e letters were produced at the trials.</P>
<P>They were all full of fal&s;e &s;pelling, no points, no marks of di&s;tinction,
no air of coming from men of bu&s;ine&s;s. Trea&s;on was wrote, in plain
terms. Five per&s;ons of different places and nations could not agree to
write their own names fal&s;e the &s;ame way, the &s;ame fal&s;e Engli&s;h, and
wrote on paper that had the &s;ame mark and the &s;ame &s;ize; agree in the
&s;ame cant and affectation; which, on examination, was found all to be
&s;o. Nothing but in&s;piration could work this miracle. On the contrary,
whoever compares the periods, the manner of expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;trokes of
the pen, with Otes' and Tong's original papers, will find they all came
out of the &s;ame mint. What Otes &s;aid of Don John had as little re|&s;emblance
of Spani&s;h forms, as his de&s;cription had to his per&s;on; and
when Mr. Kirby blamed Otes for &s;o gro&s;s a mi&s;take, he replied, by way
of excu&s;e, he might well give a wrong de&s;cription of a man he had never
&s;een in his life. His contradictions about the Je&s;uits hou&s;e. Arundel and
Bella&s;is were to be acquainted with it. But he did not &s;ay they knew
what he afterwards accu&s;ed them for. He did not particularly accu&s;e
any lord, till he had been before the hou&s;e of commons and &s;aw how
they reli&s;hed it; nor did he till then give them their different employ|ments,
which they were very unfit for. The Queen and the duke of
York were not accu&s;ed till a con&s;iderable time after. Otes, before the
hou&s;e of lords, declared on oath, that he had no accu&s;ation again&s;t any
per&s;on of what&s;oever quality, but who he then named. Yet, a fortnight
after, he accu&s;ed the queen. William Colman was examined in council.
Otes told the chancellor, he had never &s;een him before; yet he told
another &s;tory afterwards. He &s;aid he was tru&s;ted with the je&s;uits great|e&s;t
&s;ecrets; yet they would not tru&s;t him with money for his coach hire,
when he went to Dover, but &s;ent Grove with him to pay it. He had
delivered &s;o many commi&s;&s;ions, yet kept not one for a proof, though
he intended from the fir&s;t to di&s;cover all. He &s;wore, that &s;o many arms
were bought, yet none were ever found. Armies, he &s;aid, were rai&s;ed,
yet none appeared.</P>
<P>The plot was de&s;igned to de&s;troy the duke of York; whom, in par|liament
and in his information, Otes calls a ra&s;cal, papi&s;t, and traitor.
&startq;He &s;hall, be hanged; and I hope to live to &s;ee it. We will have
<PB N="88" REF="100">
no more regard for him, than for a &s;cavenger of Kent-&s;treet. It is to be
hoped, we &s;hall &s;ee him at the bar of the hou&s;e of commons, where
many better men than he have been. If the devil has a hotter place in
hell than another, I hope he will be&s;tow it on him.&endq; The&s;e were the
flowers of his eloquence. Yet this language was borne. The King di&s;|covered
villainy from the fir&s;t, and would have nipped it in the bud,
had he not been diverted from it by the trea&s;urer, who would lay it
before parliament; and it was catched at and &s;wallowed, with &s;uch
greedine&s;s, that all contradiction was impo&s;&s;ible. The fir&s;t of Septem|ber
was appointed, by parliament, to execute the penal laws.</P>

The King, at fir&s;t, directed his &s;ervants to oppo&s;e it; but, &s;oon after, he
de&s;ired the duke to ab&s;tain, who did it out of obedience. The hou&s;e of
lords, on the eighth of November, addre&s;&s;ed that the duke &s;hould with|draw
from court. The King endeavoured to &s;top their career. On the
thirtieth, the duke was excepted out of the act. Sir Edmund Bury God|frey's
death <HI>felo de &s;e.</HI> Five hundred pounds were offered for a di&s;covery.
This reward made Bedloe come to one Brewer, for a de&s;cription of God|frey's
per&s;on. So, on the eighth of November, he depo&s;ed, that Godfrey
was murdered in Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, by the lord Bella&s;is direction. That
him&s;elf, with &s;ome fellows, had decoyed him into the court, where others,
&s;uddenly ru&s;hing on him out of a door, forced him into the hou&s;e and
murdered him. That his body lay there two days, and was at la&s;t car|ried
to the place where it was found. The King was at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e,
at the time Bedloe laid the murder. This made him doubt it, and &s;end
the duke of Monmouth with Bedloe to Somer&s;et hou&s;e, to &s;hew him the
place where every thing pa&s;&s;ed. On his return, the duke told the King,
that the Queen's back-&s;tairs was the place where Bedloe &s;aid the body
lay. The King was there, a centry at every door, a foot company on
guard; yet no body &s;aw or heard any thing. The King was &s;o &s;en&s;ible
of villainy, that he did not care to prolong Bedloe's pardon.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of commons' bu&s;ine&s;s was to defeat the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. So, on
the twenty-fifth of November, the Queen was accu&s;ed. O&s;&s;ory and
Bridgewater were &s;ent with Otes, to &s;hew them the place where the
Queen &s;aid the words charged. He directed them fir&s;t to the guard|room,
<PB N="89" REF="101">
then to the privy-chamber; out of which, he &s;aid, &s;he went up a
pair of back &s;tairs to a great room. Whereas there were neither any
&s;uch &s;tairs thereabouts, nor any large room in that &s;tory.</P>
<P>The duke of Monmouth began, now, to &s;et up for him&s;elf. He held
cabals with the lord Ru&s;&s;el, Sir Henry Capel, Mountague and others;
and Sir Thomas Arm&s;trong &s;aid, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, that Monmouth
a&s;&s;ured him the King had promi&s;ed to declare him prince of Wales, and
if the King died he had four witne&s;&s;es ready to &s;wear, that the King was
married to Mrs. Barlow. The King was acquainted with it by the
trea&s;urer, and reproved Monmouth; but he did not change his conduct.
Colonel Birch moved the trea&s;urer to per&s;uade the King to it; but was
told, that the King abhorred &s;uch an untruth. The trea&s;urer was, now,
&s;truck at.</P>
<P>Mountague's corre&s;pondence with the Nuncio.&mdash;He was appri&s;ed of
what was intended, and had &s;ecured the papers which the King de&s;igned
to &s;eize. Francis, Dugdale, Dangerfield, Smith, and others, offered
them&s;elves as witne&s;&s;es. The parliament would not give the King a
groat, yet he was forced to maintain this rabble of witne&s;&s;es. Colman
condemned. He was a bu&s;y man, and generally hated. Five lords im|pri&s;oned.
The parliament was di&s;&s;olved on January the twenty-fourth,
1679. The day before the di&s;&s;olution, Praunce was removed before the
King and council. Green, Barry, and Hill were his accu&s;ers. The &s;e|cond

come as privately as po&s;&s;ible, that it might not be known at court, till
he arrived at Wind&s;or. He told it only to the duche&s;s; taking Peter|borough
and Churchill along with him. He came from Calais, in a
French &s;hallop, to Dover; where he was not known, but to Portman,
an hone&s;t man, who kept the &s;ecret. He left Peterborough, and rode
po&s;t, with Churchill, to London. He took a coach at Southwark, and

Ap&s;ley's near St. James's; and got to Wind&s;or as the King waked,

think it proper for him to keep the command of the hor&s;e-guards, &s;ince
he was no longer general; and he de&s;ired, that the duke of Grafton

<P>On the twenty-eighth of November,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 28th.</NOTE> the duke of Monmouth arrived,
about eight o'clock at night, at Whitehall. He &s;ent, by captain God|frey,
a &s;hort letter to the King; hoping that he would not be offended
at his coming over, &s;ince it was with a de&s;ign for his &s;ervice; and, hav|ing
&s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence to &s;peak to him, de&s;ired his leave.
The King an&s;wered, in writing, that he was extremely &s;urprized to hear
of his coming into England, after &s;uch po&s;itive commands not to do it.
He ordered him to be gone immediately, if he hoped ever to &s;ee his face
again; and to do it &s;o privately and &s;uddenly, that the world might
take no notice of his di&s;obedience. Godfrey returned, with repeated in|&s;tances
for Monmouth's &s;eeing the King and &s;peaking a word; a&s;&s;uring
his Maje&s;ty, that he would do any thing he de&s;ired. The King &s;aid, he
would be obeyed; and &s;tood firm. His coming was concerted with the
lords, now framing pretences for the parliament's &s;itting; and there was
rea&s;on to think, that Monmouth had been in town three or four days
before he &s;ent to the King; it being known, that Godfrey had been
there &s;o long. If the duke did not go, the King was re&s;olved to &s;end an
officer of the guards to &s;ee him on &s;hip-board. This the King told
Godfrey, after being with him the &s;econd time. The King went to bed,
not doubting but Monmouth would obey, none as yet knowing of his
<PB N="99" REF="111">
coming. But, after twelve o'clock at night, Monmouth came to his
lodgings at Whitehall; and, before the morning, it was known all
over the town. Monmouth came to vi&s;it him, as &s;oon as &s;tirring. The
King ro&s;e; and fre&s;h in&s;tances were made only to &s;ee him. Lord
Fauconberg, Macclesfield and his &s;on came upon the errand. The
King refu&s;ed, and ordered him immediately from Whitehall; and, by
night, out of England, on pain of lo&s;ing all his places. He an&s;wered,
by lord Fauconberg, that he was gone out of Whitehall; but begged
he might be permitted to &s;tay in England, in any place. He was then
at his hou&s;e in Hedge-lane, where the cabal held a meeting. The King
&s;till peremptorily ordered him to be gone; and, if he did not obey
by that night, he mu&s;t never expect to &s;ee his face any more. The
King &s;ent for all the principal officers of his troop immediately, and
ordered them not to obey Monmouth. He re&s;olved to take away his
po&s;t of captain of the guards; and, for that purpo&s;e, ordered Sunder|land
to make a commi&s;&s;ion for the duke of Albemarle to be captain,
and to &s;end for him to town. The duche&s;s of Monmouth begged the
King to &s;ee the duke. The King bid her tell him, that he wanted
nothing but an entire obedience in this matter; and that he would give
him no longer time, nor hear any more from him. The next morning,
&s;he &s;ent the King a letter, that her hu&s;band was not yet gone, and re|newed
the reque&s;t of admittance into his pre&s;ence, as he had &s;omewhat
to ju&s;tify him&s;elf from the accu&s;ation. He &s;ent her a verbal an&s;wer,
de&s;iring her to remember what he had &s;aid the night before; and that
he would certainly be as good as his word.</P>
<P>Fauconberg came, in the afternoon, with a letter from Monmouth,
pretending he had long refu&s;ed to bring it; but had yielded, at la&s;t, to
his importunities. The King would not receive the letter, nor &s;end an
an&s;wer to it, but that he had nothing to &s;ay to him. The duke of
Albemarle was put, that evening, into the command of the guards,
Mulgrave made governor of Hull and lieutenant of the Ea&s;t Riding,
and the earl of Shrew&s;bury made lieutenant of Stafford&s;hire. The com|mi&s;&s;ion
of ma&s;ter of hor&s;e was likewi&s;e taken from Monmouth, though
not di&s;po&s;ed of. Sir Thomas Arm&s;trong was turned out of the guards,
and his commi&s;&s;ion given to Mr. Griffin. The thou&s;and pounds that he
had paid were, however, refunded. A de&s;ign was laid to prove the
<PB N="100" REF="112">
King's marriage with Monmouth's mother. They pretended that a letter
was taken from her, when &s;he was put in the Tower, under the King's hand,
owning the marriage; and, to prove that the paper was then taken, they
produced a news-book, in 1652, calling her Charles Stewart's wife, and
&s;aying, that the letter was to be a ground for it. Sir&mdash;Parry pre|tends
to prove the marriage, by a bi&s;hop that is dead.</P>

<P>On the twenty-&s;ixth of January,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1680. Jan.</NOTE> the parliament was prorogued to the
fifteenth of April. Mon&s;ieur d'Avaux &s;olicits the Dutch to an alliance
with France. A further prorogation to November was urged, for that
purpo&s;e; &s;o that the King of England could not a&s;&s;i&s;t the States, if at|tacked.
Thus a prorogation might keep France from invading Hol|land,
and Holland from a league with France. The King propo&s;ed to
recal the duke of York before the &s;e&s;&s;ion. But he was di&s;&s;uaded by his
mini&s;ters. The duke of York told the privy council, whom he had
cho&s;e, that he would acquaint the King, that he had, in Scotland, a
brave and loyal nobility and gentry; a regular and wi&s;e privy council;
and the judicatures $illed with learned and upright per&s;ons. That the
di&s;affected party was not &s;o con&s;iderable as tho&s;e in England repre&s;ented

they were now firm to the King's intere&s;t. He took leave of the privy
council; the chancellor an&s;wering how &s;en&s;ible they were of the honour
of his pre&s;ence, the advantages of his conduct and advice; and that
they them&s;elves were entirely devoted to the King, and to his royal

Plunket's. Blackburn's contract of marriage of the King and Mrs.
Barlow. The King is re&s;olved to &s;earch into the bottom of it; and
Sir Gilbert Gerrard, who was &s;aid to have &s;een it, was carried before the
privy council, and declared po&s;itively, that he had neither &s;een nor knew
any thing of it. In May following, the King being indi&s;po&s;ed, with
two or three ague fits, the duke of Monmouth wrote to him to enquire
of his health; &s;igning at bottom, &startq;Your dutiful Monmouth.&endq; He
inclo&s;ed it in one to Mr. Godolphin; who delivering it to the King, HE
bid Godolphin tell him, if he would make his actions an&s;werable to
the conclu&s;ion of his letter, and obey his orders, it was the only way to
a reconciliation. But if he flattered him&s;elf with the &s;upport of the
factious party, or that parliament might interfere in his favour, he &s;hould
find it would make things wor&s;e. Accordingly, about a month after,
finding no change in Monmouth's conduct, he publi&s;hed a declaration,
prote&s;ting, on the word of a King and a faithful Chri&s;tian, that he was
never married to Mrs. Barlow, alias Walters, the duke of Monmouth's
motner; nor to any other woman but the Queen; which, together with
the oaths of all the lords pre&s;ent, was regi&s;tered in Chancery.</P>

The duke of York's removal abroad was di&s;cour&s;ed more than

thought of no &s;uch thing. Coming to London, Mr. Hyde told him, that
Sunderland was grown cold to him; and, though they often &s;aw one
another, had never opened his mouth to him of any bu&s;ine&s;s, which
made him and the duke of York believe the reports were true. But
Hyde did not think his friend Godolphin of that mind. He was un|deceived
the next day after the King came to town, when they told him
they thought the duke of York's ab&s;ence for the King's &s;ervice; and,
the next day, both &s;aid &s;o to the duke. E&s;&s;ex was for his returning
to Flanders: Halifax only from court: the King in doubt whether he
&s;hould be able to &s;tand by him. E&s;&s;ex and Shafte&s;bury are reconciled.
Halifax was an athei&s;t, and had no bowels. The King con&s;ulted the

<P>Two days after, he de&s;ired their advice, whether he &s;hould break the
parliament, if the duke of York was impeached; but this was a que&s;tion
not to be an&s;wered, &s;o no re&s;olution was taken in council about the duke
of York. On Sunday, the King propo&s;ed his going to Scotland; and
wrote, on Monday, to his council there, that he had ordered his brother
to repair thither, to look after the affairs of the realm. The duke,
accordingly, on Wedne&s;day, took leave of the King and &s;et out. The
King expected, that the parliament would move for the militia, or &s;ome
act to retrench his power, and would then di&s;&s;olve it. The duche&s;s of
Port&s;mouth complained of the duche&s;s of York, as being kinder to the
dutche&s;s of Mazarin than to her. After the duke's return from Scot|land,

The expul&s;ion of the members, for di&s;couraging petitions,

<P>Dugdale, Franci&s;co Perez, and Dangerfield were thought to le&s;&s;en

<P>As &s;oon as Dangerfield had given his evidence, lord Ru&s;&s;el carried the
bill to the lords. Many of the hou&s;e of commons oppo&s;ed it; but his
imperious temper hurried him on with it; and the members gave a

was made for the King's divorce. The commons were vexed at the
bill's being rejected. Ru&s;&s;el declared, if his father had been again&s;t it,
he would have voted him an enemy to the King and country; and, if
he could not live a prote&s;tant, he would die one. Mr. Leve&s;on Gower
&s;aid, &s;ome, perhaps, might be for making peace with the duke of York,

Peterborough was kept on till three, that the bill of exclu&s;ion might
lie on the table. The duke of York's friends thought it of wor&s;e con|&s;equence;

at &s;ea, and his foul at land. He owned, that he confe&s;&s;ed and re|ceived
once a week, at the je&s;uit's, to di&s;cover their de&s;igns; yet was no
Catholic in his heart, but to get favour with the je&s;uits. When, on his
accu&s;ing the lords Arundel and Bella&s;is, and Sir George Wakeman, as
knowing of the plot, the King &s;aid, that the two lords had &s;erved him
and his father &s;o eminently, that, unle&s;s proofs were full, no credit was

it, by the je&s;uits.&endq; The King, afterwards, mentioned this publickly.</P>
<P>At his fir&s;t examination, he &s;aid he had been at Madrid when the 5 or

Don John was a little, fat, well complexioned man, though brown hair.
He &s;aid he had been at the je&s;uit's college, with father La Chai&s;e, the King
of France's confe&s;&s;or; he knew not where, but &s;aid it was the hou&s;e ju&s;t

about the queen; before whom he had &s;worn, that he had no other per|&s;on
of quality whatever to accu&s;e. This was a forthnight before he ac|cu&s;ed
her. The lord chancellor a&s;king him at council, if he had ever
&s;een Coleman, he &s;aid, no; yet, at his trial he told another &s;tory. It
was impo&s;&s;ible that the je&s;uits &s;hould tru&s;t Otes, after turning him out
of their &s;ociety for ignorance and debauchery.</P>
<P>Lord Bella&s;is, a brave officer, was infirm, troubled with the gout,
and unfit for employment: Petre was timorous, and no &s;oldier: Sir
Francis Ratcli$f, no man of the &s;word, and $inical; and when Otes
&s;wore he had given him his commi&s;&s;ion in Wild-garden, he had not been
in London for two years, but con&s;tantly at his hou&s;e in Northumber|land,
not having, in that time, lain a night out of it, as was known to
all in tho&s;e parts, and as Daniel Collingwood te&s;tified in the hou&s;e of
commons when he was fir&s;t accu&s;ed. Colonel Thomas Howard was
grown very infirm, and died of his indi&s;po&s;ition, about the time named
by Otes, who &s;wore he gave him a commi&s;&s;ion in Wild garden, when
Thomas Howard was at Bath; and, after he came to London, he never
&s;tirred out, being &s;o lame and infirm, that he could not walk up &s;tairs,
but was carried in a chair, not able to &s;tand or walk. He died a forth|night
after he came from Bath. Sir William Goring, not of age,
and but lately come from abroad, was unfit to have many thou&s;and
pounds pa&s;s through his hands. No meeting of je&s;uits at the White|hor&s;e
Tavern, though once in three years they met to chu&s;e a provin|cial,
and other officers, &s;ecretary, procurator. All that died in pri|&s;on,
or were executed, denied it: No commi&s;&s;ion was produced or ap|peared:
No arms in any Roman Catholic's hou&s;e that was &s;earched,
be&s;ides a fowling-piece and a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols.</P>
<P>Bedloe, when he was fir&s;t examined, before the &s;ecretaries Coventry
and William&s;on, in the King's pre&s;ence, declared he knew nothing of
any plot; but only of Godfrey's murder (&s;ee Journals of the lords
next day); yet turned witne&s;s for the plot. He made a fooli&s;h
&s;tory, of Spani&s;h pilgrims to land at Milford; &s;wore again&s;t White|bread
and Fenwick, though, when brought to the bar and examined, he
denied, when a&s;ked upon oath, if he had any thing to &s;ay again&s;t them;
<PB N="120" REF="132">
yet they were condemned and hanged on his evidence, which agreed with
Otes's. He &s;wore, that Godfrey's body lay upon the &s;tairs at Somer&s;et|hou&s;e,
in a common pa&s;&s;age for pages and footmen, between eight and
eleven at night.</P>
<P>Praunce, after accu&s;ing the four, afterwards hanged for Godfrey's
murder, being &s;ent for to the council to be examined, de&s;ired captain
Richard&s;on to carry him fir&s;t to the King, having &s;omewhat of con&s;e|quence
to tell. He was, accordingly, carried to Chiffinch's chambers,
where the King came. Praunce fell at his feet, trembling and &s;haking,
which the King &s;eeing, he called in Richard&s;on and Chiffinch. Then
Praunce confe&s;&s;ed, that he was perjured, and not a word of truth in all
that he had depo&s;ed; that he had no re&s;t till he told this to the King; and,
being brought to the council, he made the &s;ame confe&s;&s;ion. But, when he
got back to pri&s;on, he un&s;aid it again; and &s;wore to it, at the trial of the
three per&s;ons he had accu&s;ed, and who were condemned. The fourth,
Bury, a prote&s;tant, was reprieved. He told Dr. Loyd, he would not
tell a le to &s;ave his life, and, that all Praunce had &s;worn was fal&s;e.
When he would not confe&s;s the fact, he was, after fifteen days, hanged.
He died a prote&s;tant. Godfrey was not &s;een by any body, after one,
the day he was mi&s;&s;ing. Bedlow &s;aw the body lying on the Queen's
back &s;tairs, which looks into one of the courts. Praunce &s;ays, in a

A &s;cheme for the government of Scotland. The revenue but 60,000 l.

Argyle, Athol, and Seaforth, &s;even hundred pounds each, to an&s;wer

The King approved of it. Lauderdale offended at the duke of York's
exceptions to the lord regi&s;ter, the earl of Argyle, and the pre&s;ident of
the &s;e&s;&s;ion. He laboured to per&s;uade the King, that they were all di&s;|po&s;ed

<P>The Scotch parliament had framed a new te&s;t, which was refu&s;ed by

to take away his life, but to get a forfeiture of &s;ome juri&s;dictions and &s;upe|riorities
&s;urreptitiou&s;ly acquired by his predece&s;&s;ors, and mo&s;t tyrannically
exerci&s;ed, &s;o the examination &s;topped. He e&s;caped out of pri&s;on, by
means of his daughter's changing cloaths with her footman, and carrying
up her train. He pa&s;&s;ed undi&s;covered by the guards, and got out of the

<P>The prince of Orange tries again to get the King to clo&s;e with par|liament,
and de&s;ert the duke of York. The King's nece&s;&s;ities forced
him to a private treaty with France. Fifty thou&s;and pounds a quarter
were the terms; and the fir&s;t payment to be at the end of June 1681;
without any condition on the King's part, but that of friend&s;hip; and
with promi&s;es on the French part, not to di&s;turb Flanders or Holland.
But France thinking it no breach to take Stra&s;burg and Ca&s;&s;el, and block
up Luxembourg, the Dutch clamoured; and the King promi&s;ed to call
a parliament, if France proceeded <HI>par voy defait.</HI> So the King was
forced to &s;end a memorial to the French King, that, unle&s;s he &s;uf|fered
provi&s;ions to be brought into Luxembourg, he mu&s;t call a parlia|ment.
Halifax is for the duke of York's being &s;ent for. Fifty wag|gons
let in. The parliament to convene at Cambridge. France offered
to quit all pretences, if Luxembourg is delivered. This was &s;ufficient
to ground a treaty. All the Dutch vehement &s;olicitations, for a parlia|ment,
came from the prince of Orange. The duke of York comes
to court, by the duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth's means. G. Jefferies, the duche&s;s
of Port&s;mouth's council, a&s;&s;ured, that the five thou&s;and pounds a year
being &s;urrendered to him, he might &s;urrender it again to the duche&s;s of

not a&s;&s;i&s;t them, without a parliament, was evident; and, therefore, that

were the &s;ub&s;tantial matters of la&s;t parliament; and if a parliament was ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
he &s;hould propo&s;e &s;omewhat for a better agreement. He replied,
that he knew only abroad, and under&s;tood them not at home. Being
pre&s;&s;ed extremely to propo&s;e &s;omewhat, he de&s;ired time to think of it.
The King had called &s;everal parliaments, partly to a&s;&s;i&s;t his foreign

would not give a farthing to pre&s;erve Tangier. The King de&s;ired the

of York.</P>

<P>The King judged it unfit to call a parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t.</NOTE> But if the French
King ab&s;olutely invaded Flanders and broke the peace, he would call
one; though in that ca&s;e, he did not expect that they would do any thing
for pre&s;erving Flanders, without having their will at home; and, even in
that ca&s;e, he would part with them again. The King was de&s;ired to name
commi&s;&s;ioners, to &s;peak with the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, in pre&s;ence of that
<PB N="127" REF="139">
of the Dutch, to &s;ee what they would go on, before the prince of Orange
went away. This the King agreed to; and appointed Halifax, Con|way
the &s;ecretary, and Hyde. The &s;ub&s;tance or the conference was,
that the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;adour de&s;ired the King to &s;end the States word
what he was in a condition to do, if France proceeded farther <HI>par voye
de fait.</HI> An&s;wer, this would put the King on making a &s;tep by
him&s;elf, if the States &s;hould not be &s;o forward as the King proposed to
be. Secondly, a&s;ked, that the King and States might appoint their
mini&s;ters at Paris to pre&s;ent memorials, that the King of France would
remit all further preten&s;ions, to be decided at the conference at Court|ray;
and, mean while, not to put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any place,
either by decree of the chamber of Metz, or by force. And if he de|nied
this, thirdly, that the King and States &s;hould declare they mu&s;t
take other mea&s;ures for pre&s;erving the Low Countries. And, fourthly,
the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;adour de&s;ired that the King would &s;end over two thou|&s;and
foot, of his own men, to Flanders, by way of loan, till they could
perfect the levies they were about.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t, was an&s;wered, that what memorial &s;oever the States
would order their amba&s;&s;ador to deliver at Paris, the King's &s;hould have
orders to &s;econd it, though he had not had the &s;ame experience. The
States would not order theirs to u&s;e the phra&s;e of taking mea&s;ures; but
let it be what it would, as the King had hitherto u&s;ed jointly with the
States, he would continue to do &s;o, and make no &s;eparate &s;teps. As to the
fourth propo&s;ition, the King had no obligation to &s;end any men, till war
was declared; that the number was too incon&s;iderable for the pre&s;ervation
of Flanders, but too many for him to &s;pare from his &s;ervice. This was
reported to the King, in pre&s;ence of the prince of Orange. The King
agreed to it; and the prince of Orange was fain to acquie&s;ee, though
not &s;atisfied. The prince's coming was certainly contrived by the Spa|ni&s;h
amba&s;&s;adour and our own people, to try, if po&s;&s;ible, either by the
con&s;ideration of foreign or of dome&s;tic affairs, to oblige the King to
call a parliament &s;peedily; in which all the points, art and indu&s;try ima|ginable
have been u&s;ed, but the King has re&s;i&s;ted them all. Yet if
France continue to proceed as &s;he has done, it will be un&s;upportable;
and a parliament will be called, as the French amba&s;&s;ador has been
<PB N="128" REF="140">
told. The faction pretended now to be afraid of France; and would
not aim at the bill of exclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Since the prince of Orange's going a project on foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E. Seymour's letter.</NOTE> by the South|ampton
club,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 13th.</NOTE> of having the parliament pre&s;ently called, in which they
undertake for a &s;upply for pre&s;erving Flanders, and not to in&s;i&s;t on
exclu&s;ion, or que&s;tion any mini&s;ters, was the very dregs of the prince's

that Sir John Moore would be cho&s;e lord mayor on Thur&s;day.</P>
<P>The news of Stra&s;bourg &s;urprized them, and had an ill effect on
di&s;intere&s;ted people. The King an&s;wered, to the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador's

Monmouth had refu&s;ed the te&s;t. The duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth would do
the duke of York all the &s;ervice &s;he could. The King of Sweden had
come into the prince of Orange's league. On Hales's excu&s;ing him&s;elf,
Mr. Chudleigh was cho&s;e for Holland. When a parliament is called to
pre&s;erve Luxemburgh, the Dutch will not concern them&s;elves, whether
it is pre&s;erved or no; &s;o that we &s;hall only di&s;compo&s;e our own affairs,

But they had forced him to a rigid ad|herence to the rules of the church, in articles for which others have frequently obtained di&s;pen&s;ations. This appears from his own account of his conver&s;ion, which he relates as follows. The extract was made from his own memoirs, and in his own very words, by father Sanders, his confe&s;&s;or.

<P>&startq;It was about the beginning of the year 1669,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa|pers, D. N. vol. II. fol.

Accordingly, I &s;ent for one father Jo&s;eph Symonds, a Je&s;uite, who had the reputation of a very learned man, to di&s;cour&s;e with him upon that &s;ubject; and when he came, I told him the good intentions I had of being a catholic, and treated with him about my being reconciled to the church. After much di&s;cour&s;e about the matter, the father very &s;incerely told me, that, unle&s;s I would quit the communion of the prote&s;tant church of England, I could not be received into the catholic church. I an&s;wered, that I thought it might be done, by a di&s;pen&s;ation from the pope; alledging to him the &s;ingularity of my ca&s;e, and the advantage it might bring to the catholic religion in general, and in particular to tho&s;e of it in England, if I might have &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation for outwardly appearing a prote&s;tant, at lea&s;t, till I could own my&s;elf publicly to be a catholic, with more &s;ecurity to my own per&s;on and advantage to them. But the good father in&s;i&s;ted, that even the pope him&s;elf had not the power to grant it; for it was an unalterable doctrine of the church, not to do ill that good might follow. What this good Je&s;uit thus &s;aid, was, afterwards, confirmed to me by the pope him&s;elf, to whom I writ upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. Till this time, I be|lieved (as it is commonly believed, or, at lea&s;t, &s;aid, by the prote&s;tant church of Eng|land doctors) that di&s;pen&s;ations, in any &s;uch ca&s;es, are by the pope ea&s;ily granted: but father Symond's words, and the letters of his holine&s;s, made me think it high time to u&s;e all the endeavours I could to be at liberty to declare my&s;elf, and not to live in &s;o un&s;afe and &s;o unea&s;y a condition.&endq;</P></NOTE>.&endq;</P>

was glad to get tho&s;e &s;uperiorities and offices, which he thought too great
for any one &s;ubject, out of &s;uch bad hands. He e&s;caped by means of

Argyle, his enemies were too watchful to let &s;lip any opportunity of
decrying his conduct. The duke and duche&s;s of Lauderdale had a great

e&s;tate, due regard &s;hould be had, and provi&s;ion made, for the younger
children. But the duche&s;s of Lauderdale pre&s;&s;ed hard for having all
the offices, except ju&s;ticiary, confirmed to Lorne. The duke urged
for a &s;ignature and di&s;po&s;ition of the e&s;tate, for the payment of all
ju&s;t creditors, with moderate donatives to &s;uch as Argyle had ruined by
his tyranny, the &s;urplu&s;age being intended to de&s;cend to his family.

<P>The King's nece&s;&s;ities had been long &s;o great, and the parliament &s;o
refractory, that he had no way left for relief, but by a private agreement
for a pen&s;ion from France. The conduct of the French upon this, had
like to have obliged the King to call a parliament; which, at that time,
would have turned to the duke's advantage. The project was broke
off by Halifax's re&s;ined arguing, who was always for cleaving a hair in
his advice. The duke owed his return to court to the duche&s;s of Port&s;|mouth,
without her intending it. This turned out well for the King;

more marks of di&s;plea&s;ure, but the King's having owned her &s;on &s;o
publickly. So that he doubts, whether her journey to Bourbon was for
health, or by order; but &s;he managed affairs &s;o well, as to prevail
with the King to propo&s;e to the duke of York, to con&s;ent to &s;ettle on her
a rent-charge of five thou&s;and a year, for which he would give an equi|valent
out of &s;ome fund of the hereditary revenue. The duke an&s;wered,
he was ready to comply, and &s;ign any paper the attorney general &s;hould
think nece&s;&s;ary; but thought it could not well be done, without his being
<PB N="133" REF="145">
at London, in pre&s;ence of the judges, to make it valid, as was generally
believed. The duke's an&s;wer was calculated to make his return nece&s;&s;ary to
di&s;patch the affair, which was much de&s;ired by the duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth,
who was greedy to have it in her power to rai&s;e a hundred thou&s;and
pounds, as &s;oon as the grant &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed; without which de&s;ire of
hers, it was not likely, from her former behaviour to the duke, that &s;he
&s;hould pre&s;s his return.</P>
<P>This made the duke of York keep the affair to him&s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb.</NOTE> which, by
providence, none knew or had ob&s;erved, but him&s;elf; which was, that
it was not in his or any body's power to do what was de&s;ired, but an act
of parliament. So little did tho&s;e who put her on a&s;king it, or even
the King's learned council, know or remember the purport of the act.
The duke kept it &s;ecret from his tru&s;tie&s;t friends, to get her credit and
intere&s;t to facilitate his return from an honourable bani&s;hment; &s;he had
promi&s;ed, as well as Halifax and Mr. Seymour, who were &s;till again&s;t
his return. By her influence the duke returned, embarking at Leith in
a yaucht. He came to Yarmouth and Newmarket in the beginning of
March. Halifax and Seymour pre&s;&s;ed his &s;peedy return to Scotland,
de&s;iring the affair might be &s;ettled there; but could not prevail. Hyde
&s;olicited his &s;tay, on the pretence already mentioned.</P>
<P>The King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> to &s;atisfy his brother and the duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, gave

the duke, to do that affair of the po&s;t office. But, after a day or two,
the attorney general, peru&s;ing the act, found that nothing, but an act
of parliament, could impower the duke to do it. So the King and
duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth were di&s;appointed. She was then in France, and
forced to be &s;atisfied with the rea&s;on of its not being done, as &s;he could
not blame the duke. She &s;till wanted to rai&s;e a hundred thou&s;and pounds
&s;ome other way. In Augu&s;t &s;he returned, and was in as great credit
as ever; and, though &s;he lived &s;eeming well with the duke of York,
began to u&s;e it to re&s;tore Sunderland to favour, and &s;upport the party.
Sunderland was made &s;ecretary of &s;tate again, in the room of Conway;
and, mi&s;&s;ing five thou&s;and a year out of the po&s;t office, &s;he got ten
thou&s;and a quarter paid out of the privy fund, which &s;he had no notice of
till then; and was kept a &s;ecret from all the world but the duke of York;

by who&s;e means it was fir&s;t had and negociated by Churchill, and then
paid to the fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury. Had the duche&s;s known
it &s;ooner, &s;he would have got her payments &s;ooner; for the la&s;t quarter's
payment was not made when the King died. This &s;ecret, and the credit
the duke had with the King, made her jealous of him. What increa&s;ed
her fears was, that the King had frequent conferences with the duke
about religion, which &s;he fancied to be about politics. This &s;et her &s;o
again&s;t the duke, that, Sunderland being recalled, &s;he endeavoured

of fire at Newmarket prevented it. It was di&s;covered, about the end of

the work, and too many to conceal it. So, on the nineteenth of Novem|ber,
one of the days appointed for a general in&s;urrection, he went with
Walcot and Fergu&s;on to Holland; pretending no longer <HI>to walk the

<P>Either ju&s;t before the meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 4th.</NOTE> or during the &s;itting of one of the la&s;t
parliaments, a con&s;iderable &s;um was wanted to pay off &s;everal &s;hips
newly come home; and the commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury were put
to it, to find ready ca&s;h. Several ways were tried, in vain; but, the
commi&s;&s;ioners of hearth money, encouraged by a good bargain of the
overplus of that tax, for four thou&s;and pounds a year, after the be&s;t
enquiry of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury, advanced it. For the de|murrage
of the &s;hips to be paid off would have been very chargeable;
and it was &s;o much good hu&s;bandry and credit to the government. Be|&s;ides,
no body offered more, nor &s;o much, as tho&s;e that had it. The
<PB N="138" REF="150">
bargain was concluded a year &s;ooner. One Shales, who had to do with
the affair of chimney money, came and brought a project to &s;ome of the
courtiers, that, if they could get the bargain of overplus, and he and
his friends have the collecting of it, they would give the King twenty
thou&s;and pounds more than he was to have; and as much to the party,
as he &s;hould get it from. This being brought to the King, he &s;ent it
to the trea&s;urer, who examined it, and judged it impracticable. Shales,
angry with the trea&s;urer, and lord Roche&s;ter in particular, applied again
to the King, who would have &s;ent him to Roche&s;ter, but de&s;ired it
might be to Halifax, who embraced the propo&s;al warmly; repre&s;enting
it, as bringing in twenty thou&s;and pounds to the King; and that, if the
King did not pro&s;ecute the managers of the hearth money, any body el&s;e
might. This being &s;aid to the King, he, at Halifax's in&s;tance, ordered the
lord keeper to enquire into the grant made to the managers of the over|plus,
whether good in law. The lord keeper, after hearing Shales, and,
with the attorney and &s;olicitor-generals, examined the affair, reported
their opinion, that the grant was legal, and not to be broken; that the
King could recover nothing of the managers, nor could any body el&s;e:
So Halifax de&s;ired that the affair might be dropped; and no further
enquiry was made into their books, to &s;ee what they had got by the
bargain.</P>
<P>When Otes and Doctor Tong came fir&s;t to di&s;cover the plot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 1&s;t.</NOTE> before
they had appeared in public, or any body, but the King and Danby, had
heard of it, or they had been with Sir Edmund Bury God&s;rey, being
pre&s;&s;ed by Danby to let him &s;ee &s;ome of the je&s;uits letters, Otes pre|tending,
he was &s;o much tru&s;ted by them, that he often &s;aw &s;ome of their
letters, and that they pa&s;&s;ed through his hands; he promi&s;ed, but did
not perform in &s;ome weeks. He was &s;till pre&s;&s;ed, at la&s;t, to tell how
they were directed, that they might be intercepted in the Po&s;t-office; but
even this he could not do. After many puttings off, in the end of Au|gu&s;t
or beginning of September, he wrote to Danby, whom he thought
at Wind&s;or, to tell him, if he &s;ent to the Po&s;t-hou&s;e there, he would
find letters directed to Mr. Bedingfield, that would make out what he
&s;aid of the plot and de&s;ign to murder the King. Danby was gone to
lord Norris's in Oxford&s;hire; &s;o that a packet of letters, &s;o directed,
were delivered to Bedingfield's man, who was &s;ent for letters to the

<P>As &s;oon as Bedingfield received it, he carried the letters to the
duke of York, again&s;t whom, and the Roman Catholics in general, he
judged there was &s;ome de&s;ign; the letters being counterfeited, by the
names of &startq;Whitebread, Fenwick, Ireland, Blundel,&endq; whom he
knew; but was &s;ure it was none of their hands, which he knew
very well. As to Fogarty's, he could &s;ay nothing, having never &s;een his
writing; but believed it to be counterfeited, as the re&s;t. Fenwick's
name was wrong &s;pelt. The letters were all in one packet, four
&s;ingers broad, and five inches long; and all to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, giv|ing
an account, in plain Engli&s;h, that they had received letters from
Peter Talbot, archbi&s;hop of Dublin, that all things were ready, in Ireland
and Scotland; and, that they would ri&s;e in arms, as &s;oon as they heard

ended, with de&s;iring him to remember them to Mr. Colman. Beding|field
de&s;ired the duke to deliver them to the King, or one of the &s;ecre|taries;
and tell how he came by them, and his belief of their being coun|terfeited,
and de&s;igned to do him prejudice; and, that he him&s;elf knew
of no &s;uch de&s;ign. The duke did &s;o; and de&s;ired &s;ecretary Coventry
might have them. The fir&s;t letter the King opened and read was that
&s;igned Blundel; and he &s;aid, that he was of the duke and Bedingfield's
mind, there was villainy. The hand he believed to be counterfeited;
and &s;aid, that he had &s;een one very like it; and would keep the letters
to compare with &s;ome he had &s;een.</P>
<P>The duke of York pre&s;&s;ed Danby that the letters might be read at the
committee for foreign affairs; but could not get it done, till ju&s;t before
the King went to Newmarket, when they were read there. Otes's fir&s;t
narrative was al&s;o read, in Tong's hand-writing; and the letter, with
Blundel's name, compared with the narrative, and judged to be in the
&s;ame hand; and that the whole affair was a mere invention. The whole
committee was then pre&s;ent, the duke of York, prince Rupert, Chan|cellor,
trea&s;urer, Lauderdale, Arlington, Coventry, and William&s;on.
When the je&s;uits were &s;eized, their papers were compared with the&s;e
letters, and found not at all alike; and when, after all were delivered to

Sir W. Jones, attorney-general, and Sir Robert Southwell, clerk of the
council, they compared &s;ome of Otes's writing with the&s;e letters, they
verily believed one of them was of his hand-writing. They were pro|duced
at none of the trials of tho&s;e who&s;e names were put to them.
The letters &s;ent by po&s;t were &s;o ill worded, that none, but &s;uch an illi|terate
dunce as Otes, would have wrote them, or his in&s;tructor Tong,
who made all for Otes; as his Maje&s;ty was told by one, who was at &s;up|per
with the&s;e two villains, that, being warmed with wine, as u&s;ual every
night, they fell out, and called one another by their true names. Tong

more active in the con&s;piracy. He &s;aid, that the council of &s;ix gave
fifteen pounds a man, to &s;end down Aaron Smith to Scotland; that Sir
William Courtnay, Sir&mdash;Drake, and other gentlemen, knew of it, in
the We&s;t; that Mr. Booth was the per&s;on they depended on in Che&s;hire,

<P>The King was &s;eized with an apoplexy, about eight in the morning;
being dre&s;&s;ed and ju&s;t come out of his clo&s;et, where he had been &s;ome

time after he got out of bed. The duke of York was immediately ad|verti&s;ed
of it; but before he could get to him, doctor King, a phy&s;ician,
being in the drawing-room, had been called in, and let him blood. This
done, the moment after he fell; and, by the help of other remedies, pre|&s;cribed
by his own phy&s;icians, he came to him&s;elf and &s;o perfectly to his
&s;en&s;es, that there were great hopes of him the next day: But on the
fourth day, all the phy&s;icians gave him over.</P>
<P>Mr. Hooke told, that Danvers &s;ent to him and others, who were to
make a ri&s;ing in the city, by the duke of Monmouth, from Bridgewater
to London, to propo&s;e the di&s;patching of the King, by &s;hooting him, as
coming in his barge to Somer&s;et-hou&s;e; or &s;tabbing, at Whitehall or
St. James's: But Hooke &s;aid they were for open war, and it would
be ba&s;e to do it; and, if they would not promi&s;e him to de&s;i&s;t from the
attempt, he would di&s;cover them all. If Monmouth had not been
beaten, they had ri&s;en, and had men ready for it; Danvers, Manley,
Payton, and this Hooke, with others, were to have headed them.</P>

pre&s;ident of the council; Godolphin lord chamberlain to the Queen;
Sunderland and Middleton continued &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. The King
&s;howed the late King's papers to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who did
not think Charles II. &s;uch a controverti&s;t.</P>
<P>The parliament called in Scotland. The King's letter, of the twenty|eighth
of March. The parliament met in England, on the twenty fourth
of May; and &s;ettled a revenue. The King's &s;peech of the ninth of
June.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange con&s;idered the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpher&s;on's $xtracts.</NOTE> who was the pre&s;ent po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or,
and the duke of Monmouth, the pretender to the crown, as
equally ob&s;tacles to his aims. He, therefore, had been formerly ad|vi&s;ed,
by the pen&s;ionary Fagel, that his bu&s;ine&s;s was to play the one
again&s;t the other; and that whoever got the better would equally
advantage his preten&s;ions. If the D. of Monmouth &s;ucceeded, it would
be ea&s;y for him, that was a prote&s;tant as well as he, and, in the right
of his wife, the next heir, to &s;hove him out of the &s;addle. If on the
contrary the duke of Monmouth was wor&s;ted, he got rid of a dangerous
<PB N="144" REF="156">
rival; and was &s;ure all his party would then have recour&s;e to him;
which proved afterwards true. This made him, underhand, do all he
could to inflame this young man's fury and ambition; and &s;end him out,
like a victim to the &s;laughter; playing a &s;ure game him&s;elf, to whom|&s;oever
fortune &s;hould give the advantage at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The King had been long informed, even in the life of the late King,
by one Monpouleam, a companion at their drinking bouts, of the &s;trict
corre&s;pondence and friend&s;hip betwixt the prince of Orange and Mon|mouth.
Upon which the late King &s;aid, it &s;eemed &s;trange to him how
tho&s;e two &s;hould appear &s;o good friends and agree &s;o well together, as
they aimed both at the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>There were &s;o many per&s;ons, in the mean time, ready to &s;econd the
duke of Monmouth's reque&s;t, and among the re&s;t the Q. dowager,
that the King, contrary to his judgment, con&s;ented to &s;ee him, which
he &s;hould not have done, unle&s;s he had been di&s;po&s;ed to pardon. He
was willing to hear more of the matter, related by Mr. Sheldon<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He had &s;ent Sheldon to meet the duke, on his way to London. Monmouth con|fe&s;&s;ed every thing to Sheldon. He di&s;covered the intrigues of the prince of Orange and his own abettors in England. But Sunderland, it &s;eems, afterwards induced him to deny the whole when he was brought before the King; a&s;&s;uring him, that he was certain of his pardon, and therefore ought not to betray friends, that might be u&s;eful to him, on a future occa&s;ion.</NOTE>. It was
&s;trange my lord Sunderland did not oppo&s;e it; unle&s;s, as was &s;aid after|wards,
he underhand a&s;&s;ured the duke of Monmouth of his pardon, if
he confe&s;&s;ed nothing; and then, when he had de&s;troyed his own credit,
by contradicting him&s;elf, he took care to have him di&s;patched as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible afterwards. If Monmouth's head and heart had been an&s;wer|able
to his mien and per&s;onal out&s;ide, he had certainly great opportu|nities
of pur&s;uing his aims, by the turbulency of the times, whom my
lord Shafte&s;bury, by his great dexterity, had &s;o much inflamed again&s;t
the duke of York.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment of Monmouth's followers rai&s;ed di&s;contents. A com|mi&s;&s;ion
of Oyer and Terminer was i&s;&s;ued to the lord chief ju&s;tice Jef|feryes,
to go down into the We&s;t, and inflict &s;uch puni&s;hments as the
example of former reigns and the &s;ecurity of the pre&s;ent &s;eemed to re|quire.
But imprudent zeal, or, as &s;ome &s;aid, avarice, carried him be|yond
the terms of moderation and mercy; and he drew great obloquy
<PB N="145" REF="157">
upon the King's clemency, not only in the number, but in the manner
too of &s;everal executions; and in &s;hewing mercy to &s;o few, particularly
to an old gentlewoman, one Mrs. Alice Li&s;le, who was condemned and
executed, only for harbouring one Hick and Nel&s;trop, both ill men
enough indeed, and the latter in a proclamation. But, as &s;he pre|tended,
was ignorant of it, and therefore, perhaps, might &s;uffer for a
common act of ho&s;pitality. But this &s;everity was contrary to the King's
intentions; as appears from the different treatment one major Holmes
met with from the King and the chief ju&s;tice. Holmes had lo&s;t his &s;on
and an arm in the battle. He was brought up pri&s;oner to town. The
King being de&s;irous to &s;ee him, he behaved him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner,
as gained e&s;teem from every body. His carriage was free from dejec|tion,
but full of re&s;pect. He had recour&s;e to the King's mercy; and
&s;aid, the favour he had a&s;ked was more beneficial to the King than to
him, con&s;idering his lo&s;&s;es and his years. The King, who loved cou|rage
even in an enemy, could not refrain from countenancing him. He
di&s;cour&s;ed freely with him, and no one was more frequently in the anti|chamber,
till it was thought fit to &s;end him down to the we&s;t to inform
Jefferyes of tho&s;e who mo&s;t de&s;erved mercy. He was hanged with the
re&s;t.</P>
<P>The King que&s;tioned the chief ju&s;tice, but he palliated his &s;everities,
with the pretence of nece&s;&s;ary ju&s;tice; which the King knew not how to
contradict, &s;ince he had the precaution, not only to &s;end four other
judges, as his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, along with him, but Mr. Pollexfen likewi&s;e, in
quality of his &s;olicitor; who, being a known favourer of the Pre&s;byte|rian
party, he hoped would moderate the chief ju&s;tice's heat. This
made the King acquie&s;ce in what had been done, though it was of great
di&s;&s;ervice to him at bottom. The cruelties of Kirk were &s;till more in|excu&s;able
than the &s;everities of Jefferyes. He cau&s;ed many to be hanged
(vol. iv. p. 97.) more out of a bloody di&s;po&s;ition, and to &s;atisfy his own
brutal pa&s;&s;ions, than love of ju&s;tice or his matter's &s;ervice. It is not
improbable, but even then he had it in his view to draw an odium on
the King.</P>
<P>On the eleventh of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Extracts. June.</NOTE> Monmouth landed, with a hundred and fifty
per&s;ons, at Lime in Dor&s;et. Be&s;ides the information of Sheldon and the
prince of Orange, the King had been informed of it by one Monpouleam,
<PB N="146" REF="158">
a bottle-companion of Monmouth's; who al&s;o informed him of the &s;trict
corre&s;pondence between the prince of Orange and Monmouth, when he
was fir&s;t in Holland. When Monmouth was taken, he wrote, on the road,
to de&s;ire a mi&s;&s;ion into the King's pre&s;ence; having &s;omewhat to &s;ay, that
would give him a happy reign. Ralph Sheldon was &s;ent to meet him;
and being a&s;ked who had the chief confidence with the King, he &s;aid
Sunderiand. Monmouth then, knocking his brea&s;t in a &s;urprize, &s;aid,
<HI>&startq;Why then, as I hope for &s;alvation, he promi&s;ed to meet me&endq;</HI> He de|&s;ired
Sheldon to acquaint the King with it; and that he would inform
him of all his accomplices, &s;eeing &s;ome of them had the King's confi|dence.
Sheldon, on his return, was giving the King an account, when
Sunderland, pretending bu&s;ine&s;s, came into the clo&s;et; and Sheldon
&s;topt, de&s;iring to &s;peak to the King in private. But the King told
him he might &s;ay any thing before that lord, which put Sheldon to great
perplexity; yet he told what Monmouth &s;aid. Sunderland &s;eemed at
fir&s;t &s;truck; but, after a &s;hort time, &s;aid, with a laugh, if that be all
he can di&s;cover to &s;ave his life, it will do him little good. Monmouth,
after he was brought to the King, begged for mercy; but made no great
matter of di&s;covery. He would not &s;ee his duche&s;s, his wife in law,
nor in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>Proclamation again&s;t colonel Danvers, J. Trenchard, George Speke,
Francis Charlton, and J. Wildman. The lords Stamford, Delamere, and
Brandon &s;eized, and put in the Tower, Jefferies &s;ent to the We&s;t. Major
Holmes &s;ent to inform Jefferies of the mo&s;t criminal, and of &s;uch as de|&s;erved
mercy, was hanged with the re&s;t. Kirk, with his troops, made &s;trange
havock. Lord Brandon Gerard was tried and found guilty, on the twenty|&s;ixth
of November, but was afterwards pardoned. Hampden pleaded
guilty. Delamere was acquitted, and Seaton found guilty of perjury. Stam|ford
was not tried, but pardoned. Dangerfield was tried, on the twenty|eighth
of June, and found guilty of perjury. Having been whipped to
Tyburn, as he was returning in a coach, one Mr. Francis a&s;king him,
in deri&s;ion, how his back did, Dangerfield making an abu&s;ive reply,
and Francis thru&s;ting in his cane, unfortunately hurted his eye; of
which he died in &s;ome days. Francis was tried and condemned; and,
though he de&s;erved well of the King, could obtain no pardon. Hook
was &s;ent from Bridgwater to London, for the in&s;urrection there. On
<PB N="147" REF="159">
this, the King had augmented the guards to twelve or fourteen thou|&s;and men.</P>
<P>On the ninth of November the parliament met.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 9th.</NOTE> They were alarmed
at the King's &s;peech; and a debate en&s;ued about it. The charge of go|vernment

<P>The King was in danger from the prince of Orange. Bentinck
was &s;ent to congratulate on Monmouth's being taken. He was in a
grievous agony, when he under&s;tood that the King was re&s;olved
to &s;ee Monmouth; and, though he found that the duke had &s;aid
nothing of his <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> he was never at quiet till his head was off. This
was &s;o manife&s;t to all, that lord Dartmouth, returning from the exe|cution,
and giving the King an account of it, told him, that he had
got rid of one enemy, but had a more con&s;iderable and dangerous one
remaining.</P>
<P>The earl of Clarendon was di&s;&s;atisfied with colonel R. Talbot's reform|ation
and regulating of the army; yet he continued, till the beginning
of 1687. When the late King died, Sunderland was actually contriv|ing
with the duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, to &s;end the duke of York into ba|ni&s;hment
again; and the duke knew it. They thought to &s;end him
<PB N="148" REF="160">
on &s;ome emba&s;&s;y abroad, or deputy to Ireland, which Sunderland fore&s;aw
would be his ruin; and he came to the earl of Roche&s;ter, immediately
after the King's acce&s;&s;ion, and told him, though it had been his misfor|tune
to differ with him formerly, it was the effect of the times, not his
inclination. But, as he had a great e&s;teem for him, he would u&s;e &s;ome
intere&s;t he had, that he might be trea&s;urer, and his brother lord lieu|tenant
of Ireland. So made his merit to them, of what he knew the
King had re&s;olved on, before they a&s;ked it; not doubting but he would
get both laid a&s;ide, on account of religion.</P>
<P>The Scotch parliament met on the twenty-ninth of April; but the

<P>Sunderland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1686.</NOTE> be&s;ides having a pen&s;ion from the prince of Orange, had
one from the King of France. He was the mo&s;t mercenary man in
the world; veered with all winds. He got the King to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;ecret
council of Roman Catholics, to meet at his office, or Mr. Chiffinch's,
to con&s;ult of matters of religion. Being inclined to it, he drew by
degrees all bu&s;ine&s;s to it; and he him&s;elf was the umpire of all. It
con&s;i&s;ted of the lords Arundel, Powis, Bella&s;is, Dover, Ca&s;tlemain, and
father Petre. Ca&s;tlemain was &s;ent to Rome. Mr. Caryl had been &s;ent
before; but more worthy. He got father Leyburn made a
bi&s;hop, <HI>in partibus,</HI> for England; but could not get Rinaldo d'E&s;t&eacute;,
prince of Modena, and uncle to the Queen, made a cardinal. Father
Petre was made a privy councillor, contrary to his own judgment and
the Queen's advice, and a cardinal's cap &s;ollicited for him. Petre was a
plau&s;ible, but a weak man, abounding in words. Sunderland extolled
his abilities; but he was not &s;worn till &s;ome time after.</P>
<P>It had long before been agreed, between Sunderland and father Petre,
Mr. Jermyn and lord Tyrconnel, that Petre &s;hould be a cardinal. Sun|derland,
trea&s;urer, &amp;c. The pope refu&s;ed the cap; and Ca&s;tlemain
quarrelled with him; only getting leave for the King to name three
vicars general, doctor Giffard, Smith, and father Ellis, a Benedictine, who
<PB N="149" REF="161">
were accordingly con&s;ecrated. The King took the chapel at St. James's
to him&s;elf; and left that of Whitehall to the prote&s;tants. He built one
there, from the ground, for his own u&s;e; &s;ettled fourteen Benedictine
monks in St. James's; gave the Je&s;uits leave to build one in the Sa|voy;
and &s;ettled a college there, for the education of children; into
which, two hundred Roman Catholics were admitted. The Recollects
built a chapel in Lincoln's-inn-fields, and &s;ome Carmelits &s;ettled in the

p. 322.) with intent to widen the breach between him and his &s;ubjects.
But his prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t the yielding temper, which had proved &s;o
dangerous to his brother, and fatal to the King his father, fixed him in
a contrary method. He had always preached again&s;t the wavering coun|cils
of his brother; and &s;eeing that other bi&s;hops made not the &s;ame dif|ficulty,
and &s;ince many complied, he thought the re&s;t ought to do the
&s;ame. The King, therefore, gave more ea&s;ily into the chancellor's opi|nion,
who thought that a mere reprimand was not &s;ufficient. It was,
however, a fatal council: for, be&s;ides the common rea&s;ons again&s;t it,
nothing ought to have made the King more cautious, in the matter,
than the pre&s;ent conjuncture, on account of the Queen's being with
child. It was that gave the alarm; and by con&s;equence, required a
greater attention, to avoid every cau&s;e of complaint<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>

This is the rea&s;on I did not an|&s;wer you &s;ooner; thanking you for the obliging offers which you made me, and ac|quainting you, that the affair for which I quitted, is of &s;uch an extraordinary nature, that it would do an irreparable injury to that court, &s;hould it be divulged. The King your ma&s;ter would be agreeably revenged for Mr. Fagel's letter, if this affair was known in England. Three or four per&s;ons were acquainted with the whole of it, and &s;everal others know &s;ome particulars; for which rea&s;on I am &s;urpri&s;ed, that a di&s;covery has not been made to your court.

If I was to divulge the affair, it would be to the King him&s;elf; becau&s;e it regards her royal highne&s;s, as well as the prince and mon|&s;ieur de Bentinck. It is true, it regards much more the two la&s;t, and likewi&s;e a third principal per&s;on concerned, not to name &s;everal others. It regards his Maje&s;ty no further than that he would have a plea&s;ure in knowing what pa&s;&s;es at the court of the prince of Orange, and that the di&s;covery would prejudice the prince in the eyes of the world. But if I could bring my&s;elf to &s;uch a re&s;olution, I could di&s;cover to the King &s;ome very im|portant things which regard him, and which came to my knowledge; for nothing pa&s;&s;ed at court, of which I was not informed, whatever u&s;e I might make of it.

credit to arraign this &s;tep, as affording the Dutch a pretence to arm, and
alarming England, with a French alliance again&s;t their religion. So the

Lord Dover told me, the duke of Grafton owned to him, that, when
he went down to the fleet, a little before the prince of Orange came,
it was to prepare the commanders to be for him, which he did; and
a&s;&s;ured him, that he had the words of two thirds of them. He owned,
that he and the re&s;t of them had de&s;igns to have invited lord Dartmouth
on board captain Ha&s;ting or Matt. Aylmer, to have &s;eized him there,
and declared for the prince of Orange; but did not &s;ay how it was not
done. Dover &s;aid, lord Godolphin and Churchill had informed him,
that lord Dartmouth had got them to &s;peak to the prince of Orange,
that he might keep his place of ma&s;ter of the Ordnance; and they had
pre&s;&s;ed for it.</P>
<P>The King was al&s;o told, that Dartmouth had written from Port&s;mouth
to the prince of Orange, that he had hindered the prince of Wales going
from thence.</P>
<P>I was informed from a very good hand, that the prince&s;s of Orange
&s;eeing her hu&s;band much troubled, at the news of the King's being
gone for Ireland, told him, &startq;he might thank him&s;elf for it, for letting
him go as he did.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Daw&s;on being &s;ent for, by the prince&s;s of Denmark, to come
to her, when &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to go to her &s;i&s;ter's coronation,
&s;he a&s;ked Mrs. Daw&s;on, if really the child, which was called her bro|ther,
was the Queen's child? Mrs. Daw&s;on an&s;wered her it was; and
that &s;he could an&s;wer for it, as much as &s;he could an&s;wer that &s;he, the
prince&s;s, was the late duche&s;s's, having &s;een them both born; and added,
that &s;he wondered very much at her royal highne&s;s's a&s;king her the que&s;tion;
&s;ince &s;he could not forget, that, when &s;he was going to Bath, com|ing
in the morning to take leave of the Queen, and her Maje&s;ty making
her feel her belly, &s;he &s;aid to the Queen, by the child &s;tirring &s;o &s;trong,
&s;he believed the Queen would be brought to be&s;t before her return from
Bath. This I had from a gentlewoman who had it from Mrs. Daw&s;on
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lord Churchill owned to lord Dover, before they la&s;t came from Lon|don,
that the de&s;ign of his and &s;everal other officers was laid long be|fore
the prince of Orange landed.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="170">
Captain G. Churchill, commander of the Newca&s;tle, owned to lord
Buckley, that he and captain Matt. Aylmer, with &s;ome other com|manders,
had a de&s;ign to have &s;eized lord Dartmouth, before the prince
of Orange landed; and that the duke of Grafton, lord Berkeley, and
Sir J. Barry, knew of it. Captain Powel of the Queen's regiment of
Dragoons told cornet Recordan, that, when Sir J. Lanier was &s;ent to
Jp&s;wich, to oppo&s;e the prince of Orange's landing, in ca&s;e he &s;hould
have endeavoured there, with the Queen's and the prince's regiments
of dragoons, Arran and Hamilton's hor&s;e, that Sir J. was re&s;olved, if the
prince had landed, to have declared for him; and had agreed with ten
officers to have &s;ecured lord Arran, colonel Ric. Hamilton, and colonel
Connor.</P>
<P>It was about the middle of September, before the King gave any
credit to the advices, from his envoy at the Hague and others, of the
prince of Orange's de&s;ign to invade him. The repeated a&s;&s;urances he
had from the States, by their amba&s;&s;adour and others in their name, that
the preparations were not de&s;igned again&s;t him, the prince him&s;elf often
confirmed. Sunderland and others, the King tru&s;ted, per&s;uaded him
it was impo&s;&s;ible for the prince of Orange to go through with it;
and Sunderland turned any body to ridicule that &s;eemed to believe it;
and, indeed, none that the King tru&s;ted, except Dartmouth, ever &s;aid
they credited the reports; and he, from the time of Monmouth's be|heading,
always told the King he was confident, that, &s;ooner or later,
he would attempt it. But though the King did not, till then, believe
it, he ordered more &s;hips to be fitted out, to fortify the &s;quadron at &s;ea,
on the notion he had of the Dutch fitting out merchant &s;hips; and though
he did not then accept of the King of France's offer of &s;ixteen &s;ail to
join his, yet he de&s;ired them to be ready at Bre&s;t, in ca&s;e of need: and
when M. de Citters, the Dutch amba&s;&s;adour, was alarmed at the report,
and took notice of it to the King; he an&s;wered, he did not intend to
make u&s;e of them, unle&s;s his ma&s;ters obliged him to it.</P>
<P>The King, convinced of the Dutch inva&s;ion, went immediately from
Wind&s;or to London; ordered his fleet to be made up thirty men of war,
all third and fourth rates, with &s;ixteen &s;ire-&s;hips; and for troops of hor&s;e,
foot, and dragoons, to be recruited, ten men in each, except the guards;
<PB N="159" REF="171">
gave out commi&s;&s;ions for new regiments of hor&s;e and foot; ordered the
troop of guards, regiment of hor&s;e, that of dragoons, and three battalions
of foot, to march from Scotland into England; &s;ent for three battalions, a
regiment of foot and dragoons from Ireland: &s;o that his troops would be,
in all, near 40,000 men. He thought this a &s;ufficient force to deal with the
prince of Orange; as it would, if they had been faithful to him. Writs
had been i&s;&s;ued for a parliament, and &s;ome elections made; but, as he
could not be at the head of the army and attend the parliament at the
&s;ame time, though both were nece&s;&s;ary, he put off the meeting of par|liament;
and, as his council and generality of his officers were aver&s;e to
French a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he did not &s;end for the &s;ixteen fail from Bre&s;t. Tho&s;e
who had advi&s;ed his mea&s;ures, which gave mo&s;t offence, were for un|doing
all, even liberty of con&s;cience, to di&s;oblige the non-conformi&s;ts;
now the church of England was offended. Of the&s;e was Sunderland,
catholic as he pretended to be, &s;ince his public declaration, in July la&s;t,
though he was privately reconciled &s;ome months before. He re&s;tored to
the church of England, Magdalen and Sidney colleges, which he had
de&s;igned for breeding up Roman Catholic &s;cholars; but did not recall
liberty of con&s;cience. The King had kept the original petition or re|mon&s;trance
of the &s;even bi&s;hops in his pocket; yet copies flew about.
The King drew his army near London. The earl of Dartmouth, Sir
Roger Strictland, and Sir J. Barry, were the three flag officers of the fleet.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange at fir&s;t &s;tood northward; but the wind turning
contrary, next day, and blowing very hard, di&s;per&s;ed many, and drove
them back to port. Lanier's, major general Arran's, and Hamilton's
regiments of hor&s;e, with the Queen's regiment of dragoons, under co|lonel
Connor, were &s;ent to Ip&s;wich: two regiments of hor&s;e and one of
dragoons to Colche&s;ter. Dartmouth propo&s;ed to anchor to the ea&s;t of
the Galloper, clear of the &s;ands, to &s;tretch away as he plea&s;ed; but
the ea&s;t wind taking him, and blowing very fre&s;h, he anchored
a-brea&s;t of the Long&s;and-head. The prince of Orange pa&s;&s;ed by to
the we&s;tward. Dartmouth's &s;couts took a Dutch fly-boat, a league and
a half a head. Why he did not &s;ail is uncertain. He &s;aid he could not
get about the Long&s;and-head, as the wind and tyde were; yet &s;ome
commanders &s;aid he might have done it. If he could, and if the com|manders
were true, he might have de&s;troyed the fleet, or hindered their
<PB N="160" REF="172">
landing. Three battalions of guards, the King's regiment of dragoons,
and a hundred hor&s;e grenadiers, were ordered to Port&s;mouth; and, if
the prince of Orange had gone further, to march for Sali&s;bury. The
re&s;t of the troops were ordered to the we&s;t; Lanier to command the
troops at Sali&s;bury, Sir J. Fenwick at Marlborough, and another body
ordered to Warmin&s;ter; Fever&s;ham to come to Sali&s;bury, and march
we&s;t, to hinder the prince of Orange's advance, and others from joining
him. This body con&s;i&s;ted of twenty &s;quadrons of old hor&s;e, and ten of
dragoons. All the foot were ordered to the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>The public talk in the prince of Orange's army was, that he was
betrayed, none coining to join him. His own officers were for re-em|barking.
Colonel Strangeways, &amp;c. &s;ent his letters to the King. None
joined him, till lord Cornbury began the defection, colonel of the King's
regiment of dragoons and chief officer, by<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The &s;entence here is illegible.</NOTE> ordered the King's regiment of foot, under Sir Francis
Compton, the lieutenant colonel, the duke of Berwick being at Port&s;|mouth,
of three &s;quadrons, St. Albans's two &s;quadrons, under lieutenant
colonel Lang&s;ton, Fenwick's two &s;quadrons, to march, pretending or|ders;
and accordingly marched to Blandford, Dorche&s;ter, and towards
Honiton. When his own major, Clifford, a&s;ked to &s;ee his orders, or,
at lea&s;t, to know his de&s;ign, in making &s;o great a march towards the
enemy; Cornbury &s;aid, it was to beat up a quarter of hor&s;e in tho&s;e
parts; and, when they came to Axmin&s;ter, he commanded &s;ixty dra|goons
to fall into the quarter at Honiton. By this, major Littleton and
other officers, &s;u&s;pecting the matter, and beginning to que&s;tion him,
Cornbury, the commander, went away, with tho&s;e commanded men and
their lieutenant colonel Hayford, captain Ru&s;&s;el, and the re&s;t of the
captains then with the regiment, without letting the common men know
their intention. Lang&s;ton followed with his two &s;quadrons, being the
chief man that concerted with Cornbury; not letting his other officers
know of it.</P>
<P>When they came to Honiton, two regiments of the prince of Orange's
foot were ready to receive them; one commanded by Talma&s;h. Being
there, Littleton told his men, that he had brought them to &s;erve the

with about ten troopers of the King's regiment of foot, de&s;erted.
Clifford, major of dragoons, brought back the body of the regiment.
The common men were generally loyal, though &s;o many of the officers
de&s;erted; and many of St. Albans' troopers came back, as they found
opportunity, with their hor&s;es. Though the number of de&s;erters was
incon&s;iderable, it was attended with bad con&s;equences. It cau&s;ed a
jealou&s;y in the troops, who &s;u&s;pected one another; encouraged country
gentlemen to go in to the prince of Orange; and animated the enemy,
who were before di&s;couraged. The King was at London when this hap|pened.
Fever&s;ham was ju&s;t come to Sali&s;bury; and, thinking the re|giments
gone, ordered tho&s;e at Marlborough and Warmin&s;ter to Sali&s;|bury,
the foot to Andover, and tho&s;e on march to march back to Wind|for,
Staines, &amp;c. This &s;urpri&s;ed all at London; and the King &s;taid to
&s;ettle their minds before he went to Sali&s;bury. He made a &s;peech to
all the general officers about Cornbury's de&s;ertion; and offered to di&s;|mi&s;s
them, if they did not care to &s;erve: but all promi&s;ed fidelity.</P>
<P>The duke of Grafton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.</NOTE> one of the fir&s;t, &s;et out for Sali&s;bury on the
&s;eventeenth. The prince of Wales was &s;ent, at the &s;ame time, to Port&s;|mouth,
under the e&s;cort of &s;ome Scotch hor&s;e and Iri&s;h dragoons: but
the night before he left London, &s;ome of the bi&s;hops pre&s;ented a peti|tion
&s;igned by them and &s;ome peers, &s;eventeen in all; of which the dukes
of Grafton and Ormonde, the marquis of Halifax, the earl of Not|tingham,
and &s;everal con&s;iderable lords, having refu&s;ed to join with them.
The King &s;aid it was too late at ten at night to give an an&s;wer in writ|ting;
being to go next morning to Sali&s;bury: that it was not a time to
call a parliament, nor fit for him to treat with the prince of Orange,
who had invaded, contrary to the laws of God, duty of a nephew and
&s;on-in-law. He told the bi&s;hops, that it would have become them
<PB N="162" REF="174">
better to have declared their di&s;like of the inva&s;ion, than pre&s;enting
&s;uch a petition. The bi&s;hop of Winton and &s;ome others had been for
&s;igning their di&s;like<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vid, Original Papers, under the head of this year.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The King got to Sali&s;bury too late,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 19th.</NOTE> to execute his fir&s;t project of ad|vancing,
with hor&s;e and dragoons, to Axmin&s;ter and Lamport, to hin|der
the country's going in, to coop up the enemy, and with foot to &s;up|port
them in hedges as good as retrenchments. The prince of Orange
at Axmin&s;ter. The train of artillery, the Scots and Iri&s;h dragoons,
and a troop of hor&s;e guards, not come up. In the mean time, the King
re&s;olved to vi&s;it the advanced quarter at Warmin&s;ter, commanded by
major general Kirke, of the foot; Trelawney and Maine, brigadiers of
hor&s;e, who had the third troop of guards, Warden a troop of hor&s;e.
Two battalions of Dunbarton's, Kirke's, and the Queen's made the
two other battalions, and the Queen's regiment of dragoons. But
the evening before, his no&s;e fell a bleeding, and doing &s;o next morn|ing
a con&s;iderable quantity, and continuing to do &s;o &s;everal times
that day, he was obliged not to go, but to be let blood. It was
three days before it could be quite &s;topped. It is generally believed,
had it not been for this accident, that Churchill, Kirke, Trelawney,
&amp;c. who de&s;erted &s;oon after, with &s;ome in that quarter, had de&s;igned
to &s;eize the King, in going thither or coming back, and have carried
him to the prince of Orange. It was ea&s;y enough to do; the King
having no &s;u&s;picion of them. But, a few days after, he began to doubt
&s;ome of them; and once intended to &s;ecure Churchill and the duke of
Grafton, and have &s;ent them to Port&s;mouth; but, on further con&s;ider|ation,
did not think fit to do it.</P>
<P>In a council of all the officers, Fever&s;ham, count de Roy, lord Dum|barton,
and the truly loyal, advi&s;ed retiring to London: Churchill, &amp;c.
were for &s;taying at Sali&s;bury. The fir&s;t advice was followed; and
Churchill and Grafton went off that night or the next. Schomberg &s;aid
to Churchill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpher|&s;on's Ex|tracts.</NOTE> when he arrived, &startq;That he was the fir&s;t lieutenant general
he had ever heard that had de&s;erted from his colours.&endq; The next morning
advice came, that Rogers, lieutenant of hor&s;e grenadiers, colonel Law&s;on,
<PB N="163" REF="175">
captain S. George, and two or three other captains of the queen's regiment
of dragoons, were gone from Warmin&s;ter, with &s;ome few of the common
men. Kirke did not execute his orders for marching to the Devizes, and,
by Hungerford, to Reading. The King marched the &s;ame day; de|&s;igning
to po&s;t behind the Thames the foot and hor&s;e of the army; but
ordered Fever&s;ham to &s;tay behind, with hor&s;e and dragoons to cat up the
forage and maintain Reading as long as he could, without expo&s;ing
him&s;elf to have his quarter beaten up. The King went from Sali&s;bury
the fir&s;t night to Andover; and that night prince George, the duke of
Ormond, lord Drumlanrick, and others, de&s;erted, and &s;everal officers
from other quarters. The King, fearing Kirke would do &s;o too, ordered
Dumbarton to take two &s;quadrons of hor&s;e to help bringing off the four
battalions of foot ordered from Warmin&s;ter. But before he could join
them, as they were to march from the Devizes, Brigadier Trelawney,
who commanded them, with lieutenant colonel Churchill, and all his
captains, but captain Fox, and about twenty or thirty common men, and
&s;ome &s;ubalterns, de&s;erted; the re&s;t of the men, being loyal, would
not go.</P>
<P>The King continued his march to London;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 26th.</NOTE> and the troops were &s;ent
to their quarters at Maidenhead, Wind&s;or, Staines, Egham, Chert&s;ey, and
Colnbroke. Every day &s;ome officers, though few common men, de&s;erted.
The King, arriving, on the twenty-&s;ixth of November, at London, found
his daughter, the prince&s;s of Denmark, had gone off, with lady Churchill
and Mrs. Berkley. Whether it was by prince George's directions, or
the two ladies advice, is uncertain, though with child, and much afraid;
being apt to mi&s;carry. She was under the bi&s;hop of London's conduct,
at lea&s;t he met her, as &s;oon as &s;he was out of town. This made a great
noi&s;e in town; and her nur&s;e and the earl of Clarendon went up and
down like mad per&s;ons, &s;aying the papi&s;ts had murdered her; and a&s;king
&s;ome of the Queen's people what they had done with her: But it was
known the next day which way &s;he went. Some days after, a letter of
hers, or bearing that title, to the Queen, came out in print; as if &s;he
left it on the table, when &s;he went off. But no &s;uch was found; or,
at lea&s;t, delivered to the Queen. Prince George and lord Churchill &s;ent
letters to the King, with rea&s;ons for their withdrawing. The duke of
Berwick coming to the army, lord Dover had been &s;ent to command in
<PB N="164" REF="176">
Port&s;mouth. Orders to &s;end away the prince of Wales to France, if
things grew wor&s;e; and to the captain of the Mary yaucht, to tran&s;port
him; and lord Dartmouth, to facilitate it, who was come to Spithead,
with his fleet much &s;hattered, by ill weather. He had got the length
of Torbay, and &s;aw the prince of Orange's fleet at anchor, under Herbert.
But the weather was &s;o bad, that he could attempt nothing on them;
and his fleet was much di&s;per&s;ed and damaged. Some were forced back
to the Downs, Dartmouth him&s;elf to Spithead, and captain G. Churchill
put into Plymouth to &s;top a leak: And, finding the place had declared
for the prince of Orange, he did &s;o too.</P>
<P>None of the de&s;erters &s;urprized the King &s;o much as the earl of Bath,
who had received &s;o much from the crown, and was of &s;o loyal a
family. Till then, thought above temptation to do an ill action; but
he declared, and &s;ecured the earl of Huntingdon, who&s;e regiment was
in garri&s;on in the citadel, and all the Roman catholic officers, and
common men of that per&s;ua&s;ion, and kept them pri&s;oners; Ferd.
Ha&s;tings, his cou&s;in's lieutenant colonel, and &s;ome other officers, joining
with him in it. Every body now vied, who &s;hould fir&s;t abandon the
King; who, &s;oon after his arrival at London, had advice, that Sir G.
Hanmer, lieutenant colonel of Montgomery's regiment, in garri&s;on at
Hull, hearing that &s;everal lords were up in &s;everal parts of the realm,
and combining with Copely, the lieutenant governor, the pre&s;ent officer
and &s;ome magi&s;trates, had &s;urpri&s;ed the governor, lord Langdale, and
lord Montgomery, by night, in their lodgings, declared for the prote&s;tant
religion, and kept the&s;e two lords, and &s;ome Roman Catholic gentlemen
of the country, who had retired there for &s;a&s;ety, pri&s;oners; and then let
them go. Before this, lord Danby, and many other per&s;ons of quality, had
met at York, and &s;eized Sir J. Rear&s;by, who had only the name of Gover|nor,
having but one company of foot with him, and declared for a free
parliament: And the prince of Orange &s;eized all the King's money in the
collector's hands, di&s;armed the Roman Catholics, demoli&s;hed the Roman
Catholic chapel in the town, and rai&s;ed men, forming them into compa|nies
and troops. About the &s;ame time, the earl of Devon &s;ent to the
duke of Newca&s;tle to come and join him. He got &s;ome Nottingham|&s;hire
gentlemen together, and declared as Danby did; but the duke of
Newca&s;tle refu&s;ing, he plundered him of what arms and hor&s;e he had at
<PB N="165" REF="177">
Welbeck. Before this, lord Delamere was up in Che&s;hire and Lanca|&s;hire,
on the &s;ame account. He di&s;armed the Roman Catholics and &s;ome
new rai&s;ed men, demoli&s;hed the Roman Catholic chapels, and roved
about with four or five hundred di&s;orderly ill-armed men.</P>
<P>The King wrote to the lords Dover and Dartmouth to &s;end off the
prince of Wales, mo&s;t of who&s;e baggage was on board; when Dart|mouth,
&s;ending for Dover to dine with him, told him it was again&s;t the
law to &s;end the prince of Wales out of England, without more po&s;itive
orders; and he would not let it be done; and every night after, he exa|mined
every boat and ve&s;&s;el that went out. He had before &s;ent up a &s;trange
addre&s;s, by lord Berkeley, &s;igned by the commanders of the fleet, for
calling a parliament and declaring for the prote&s;tant religion. The fleet
would certainly have fought at fir&s;t, their animo&s;ity was &s;uch again&s;t the
Dutch. But the ca&s;e was altered. The prince of Wales was &s;ent for
to London, under e&s;cort of Sali&s;bury and Holmes's regiments of hor&s;e
and &s;ome Iri&s;h dragoons, which they did in two days.</P>
<P>In a meeting of lords, the King was advi&s;ed to treat with the prince
of Orange. He &s;ent Halifax, Nottingham, and Godolphin with pro|po&s;als
to him. When they came to Andover, the prince of Orange &s;ent
them word to go to Ram&s;bury, where he delayed them a day or two.
When his an&s;wer came, the King re&s;olved to go away with the Queen
and prince.</P>
<P>Monday,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 10th.</NOTE> about twelve at night, the tenth of December, the King
went privately from Whitehall to Vauxhall. He there took hor&s;e about
one, with Sir E. Hales, Sir E. Quarterma&s;ter, and a guide. He pa&s;&s;ed the
Medway, at Ailesford-bridge, took fre&s;h hor&s;e at Woolpeck, &s;ent before
by Ralph Sheldon, an equerry. He got, by ten, to Emby-ferry, near
Fever&s;ham; where a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e hoy, hired by Sir Edward Hales,
waited for them. When on board, they found it had no balla&s;t; and
it blowing fre&s;h, the ma&s;ter ea&s;ily per&s;uaded the King to let him take in
balla&s;t at Shelne&s;s. It was half ebb before they ran a&s;hore to take it in;
de&s;igning to &s;ail as &s;oon as afloat, which would have been about eleven.
He was near afloat, when three fi&s;her-boats, of Fever&s;ham, with fifty
men, boarded them, &s;eized the King and two others, as was &s;aid by
orders from tho&s;e of Fever&s;ham; &s;uppo&s;ing them papi&s;ts endeavouring
to e&s;cape; and, when the ve&s;&s;el was afloat, turned with the tide up Fe|ver&s;ham
<PB N="166" REF="178">
water. The King was not, however, known. Sir E. Hales
whi&s;pered the captain, and clapt fifty guineas privately into his hand, as
an earne&s;t of more, if he would let them go before they were put a&s;hore.
The captain promi&s;ed, but kept not his word. Coming to anchor be|fore
the mouth of the creek, he went to the ma&s;ter and told him, that
he had Sir E. Hales and two more on board; then came back and took
what money they had, under pretence of &s;ecuring it from the &s;eamen;
yet the &s;eamen came down and &s;earched them.</P>
<P>They were guarded to town, in a coach, by one Edwards, and &s;ome
rabble, to an inn, where the King was di&s;covered, and was told, lord
Winchel&s;ea and mo&s;t of the country gentlemen were at Canterbury.
He &s;ent to him to come. In the meantime, the King tried to get off;
and had got a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e &s;mack. But Edwards and the rabble be&s;et
the inn &s;o, that the King could not get to the hor&s;es he had got to carry
him to the boat. Several prote&s;tants and Roman Catholics had been &s;eized
on the road, as judge Jenner, R. Graham, Mr. Burton, prote&s;tants; Mr.
Arundel, and two ladies of that name, with Dr. Obadiah Walker, and
three or four more Roman Catholics. The King lodged at Mr.$word$,
a loyal man. The earl of Winchel&s;ea came. The &s;eamen guarded the
King; but &s;aid a hair of his head &s;hould not be touched. Sir B. Dixwell
and Sir James Oxenden came next day with militia, on pretence of &s;ecuring
the King from the rabble; but it was to hinder his e&s;cape. Tho&s;e, who
came la&s;t, were very rude. The King's letter, for cloaths, linen, and
money, from London, was &s;topped one night. Lord Fever&s;ham, with
&s;ome hor&s;e guards and hor&s;e grenadiers, coming to convey the King to
London; they &s;ent to the prince of Orange, for orders what to do with
the King. Early on Saturday morning, Fever&s;ham came to the King
and told him, that the guards were at Sittingburn. The King was con|veyed
thither by the militia, and by the guards to Roche&s;ter that night;
and he &s;ent Fever&s;ham to the prince of Orange.</P>
<P>The Queen and the prince of Wales were &s;ent away privately, on the
ninth of December, at night, under the conduct of the Count de Lau|zun,
in a yaucht, commanded by captain Gray. The King &s;ent the
prince of Orange word, that he would be at London, on Monday, and
treat to &s;ettle the nation. He doubted the fidelity of the troops, and
pa&s;&s;ed to Whitehall, through the city. It was not to be imagined, the
<PB N="167" REF="179">
acclamations that were made, and the joy &s;hewed at his coming back, among
all orders of men. He never law the like. Whitehall was crowded, and
the like joy prevailed there. But he had no &s;ooner got to his bed|chamber,
than Zule&s;tein came, with a letter from the prince of Orange,
that what Fever&s;ham propo&s;ed was of too great con&s;equence to be an|&s;wered
then; and the King had be&s;t &s;tay at Rochc&s;ter. The King &s;aid,
had Zule&s;tein come before he left it, he would have &s;laid there; but
now he hoped the prince of Orange, then at Wind&s;or, would come next
day to St. James's, to &s;peak about his propo&s;al by Fever&s;ham. Zule|&s;tein
&s;aid, he believed the prince of Orange would not come, till the
King's troops were &s;ent out of town. The King gave him a letter to the
prince of Orange; and, upon hearing that Fever&s;ham was con&s;ined, he
expre&s;&s;ed to Zule&s;tein his &s;urprize, at a breach of the law of nations,
and de&s;ired the prince of Orange would relea&s;e him. But he neither did
it, nor &s;ent any an&s;wer to the King's letter. Next day, the prince of
Orange left Fever&s;ham pri&s;oner in Wind&s;or ca&s;tle, and came to Sion;
and, at nine at night, the King was informed, that count Solmes was com|ing
with the prince of Orange's guards to take po&s;t at Whitehall. But
he &s;uppo&s;ed they would only do &s;o at St. James's, where the prince of
Orange was to come the next day. But at eleven that night, the earl of
Craven came to the King, as he was going to bed, and told him, that
Solmes was in the Park, with three battalions of the prince of Orange's
foot guards and hor&s;e; and &s;aid he had orders to take po&s;t in Whitehall,
The King &s;ent for Solmes, and told him, that he believed it was a mi&s;|take.
But Solmes &s;aid his orders were po&s;itive for Whitehall, and
&s;hewed them to the King. After arguing the matter, the King told
Craven, that he might draw off his men, and let Solmes take po&s;t; which
he did immediately.</P>
<P>Shrew&s;bury and Delamere were with Solmes in the park; but came not
up with him. Soon after one in the night, the earl of Middleton waked
the King, who was a&s;leep, and told him, that Halifax, Shrew&s;bury, and
Delamere had called him up, and told him, they had a me&s;&s;age from the
prince of Orange to deliver immediately to the King. They would not &s;tay
till morning. They were called in, and delivered a paper, &s;igned by the
prince of Orange: That to avoid di&s;orders, which the King's pre&s;ence in
London might occa&s;ion, he would po&s;itively have the King to go to Ham;
<PB N="168" REF="180">
and to be gone before ten, with what &s;ervants he would, and the prince
of Orange would &s;end guards to &s;ecure him. The King excepted to
Ham, as not being furni&s;hed, and a bad winter; and had rather go to
Roche&s;ter, as mentioned in the prince of Orange's letter, by Zule&s;tein.
They &s;aid they would a&s;k the prince of Orange, and bring an an&s;wer by
nine; but he mu&s;t po&s;itively be gone before ten. The King had &s;aid he
might be guarded there by &s;ome of his own foot; but Solmes &s;ent a
party with him. The King would have gone by water to Grave&s;end, but
Halifax oppo&s;ed it rudely. Shrew&s;bury was very fair and civil, and
agreed to the King's de&s;ire; who took barge, attended by a hundred of
the prince of Orange's guards, before and behind it. They were &s;o long
of embarking, that they lo&s;t the tide. The King arrived not till &s;even at
night. He lay there that night; and, next day, he received a blank
pa&s;s, from the prince of Orange, to &s;end one to London. The guards
not being exact at Roche&s;ter, the King was confirmed in his opinion,
that the prince of Orange wanted to have him gone; and he that brought
the pa&s;s, brought orders to the captain of the guards not to look &s;o
&s;trictly after him; &s;o they put centinels at the fore-door towards the
&s;treet, but none to the back-door towards the river; yet the King ap|prehended,
if he did not get off, that the prince of Orange would have
&s;ent him out of the world another way.</P>

<P>The King came to Roche&s;ter, on the nineteenth of December, in the
morning, where he &s;taid till the twenty-&s;econd, at night. Several of his
&s;ervants, the lords Arran, Dumbarton, Aile&s;bury, Litchfield, gentlemen
of the bed-chamber; three of his grooms, F. Griffin, and Biddolph;
major generals Fenwick and Sackville; Sir J. Talbot, brigadier;
Sutherland, quarterma&s;ter-general of hor&s;e, came to him, who all gave

<P>The prince of Orange had convened all the lords &s;piritual and tempo|ral.
The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury refu&s;ed to come, or do any thing
while the King was under re&s;traint. The lords adjourned, next day, to
<PB N="169" REF="181">
the hou&s;e of lords, at We&s;tmin&s;ter. Some bi&s;hops and others advi&s;ed
the King not to go, at lea&s;t not out of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Extracts.</NOTE> Doctor Bradey, his
phy&s;ician, was &s;ent to him, and argued the matter; but could not con|vince
the king they did not think the prince of Orange would attempt
his life. He argued it afterwards with lord Middleton, who owned, at
la&s;t, there was no &s;afety in &s;taying. The King re&s;olved to go.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange had &s;ent word to the lord mayor and aldermen,
not to give oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy, or te&s;t, to the common-council,
cho&s;en on the twenty-fir&s;t of December: and he ordered them
to act, without taking them.</P>
<P>Captain Macdonald bringing word, before twelve at night, on the
twenty-&s;econd of December, that captain Trevanion was come up with
the &s;hallop; the King left a paper, with rea&s;ons of his withdrawing.
He charged lord Middleton to have it printed, when he got to London;
but left it with Dumbarton to be given, next day, to Middleton. The
King told the earl of Litchfield of it; tru&s;ting him entirely, a man of
great honour, and who had always &s;erved with &s;teadine&s;s and fidelity.
He was forced al&s;o to tru&s;t Aile&s;bury with it; el&s;e he would have lain
in his bed-chamber, with the &s;ervants, a room through which the King
was to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The King went to bed, at his u&s;ual hour. As &s;oon as the company
were gone, he got up, dre&s;&s;ed, and went, by the back-&s;tairs, through the
garden, where Macdonald &s;taid for him, with the duke of Berwick and
Mr. Biddolph, to &s;how him the way to Trevanion's boat. About twelve
at night, they rowed down to the &s;mack, which was waiting without
the fort at Sheerne&s;s. It blew &s;o hard right a-head, and ebb tide be|ing
done before they got to the Salt Pans, that it was near &s;ix before
they got to the &s;mack. Captain Trevanion not being able to tru&s;t the
officers of his &s;hip, they got on board the Eagle fire&s;hip, commanded by
captain Wilford; on which, the wind and tide being again&s;t them, they
&s;taid till day-break, when the King went on board the &s;mack. It blew
&s;o very hard, E. N. E. and E. N. when they got to the Buoy of the
Nore, that they dur&s;t not venture to turn down any lower, and they
were obliged to bear up the river towards Lee, and anchor on the E&s;&s;ex
&s;hore, under the lee of the &s;and, in &s;mooth water, till the next tide of
flood &s;hould be gone. It blew very hard all that day, being Sunday.
<PB N="170" REF="182">
As it began to be dark, the gale &s;lackened a little; &s;o that when the
tide broke, they got under &s;ail, and turned down as far as the Red Sand.
Next morning, the weather being fair, they got under &s;ail before
&s;un-ri&s;e; and, without tacking, reached the buoy off the Narrows,
turned through it, and &s;o to North-foreland; de&s;igning to go on the
back of the Goodwin, and not through the Downs. But they could
not weather it, and &s;o went through the Downs. There &s;even &s;hips lay
at anchor; but not one under &s;ail. It began to &s;now about fix; and
not being able to fetch Calais, they bore away for Boulogne, and an|chored
before Ambleteu&s;e, where they landed, about three on Tue&s;day
morning, Chri&s;tmas-day.</P>

<P>The King landed at Kin&s;ale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689. Macpher&s;on's Extracts.</NOTE> on the 12th of March. He found a
great deal of good will in that kingdom, but little means to execute
it; which made the prince of Orange &s;light it to the degree he did.
The fear of di&s;gu&s;ting the Iri&s;h catholics, on whom he wholly depended,
and the hopes of recompen&s;ing &s;uch prote&s;tants as &s;uffered by the act for
re&s;cinding the acts of &s;ettlement, induced the King, at la&s;t, to give his
royal a&s;&s;ent, though he &s;aw it was highly prejudicial to his intere&s;t.
Nothing, but the unwillingne&s;s to di&s;gu&s;t his only friends, could prevail
with him to foreclo&s;e him&s;elf in the act of attainder, from the power of
pardoning tho&s;e compri&s;ed in it; and to agree to &s;uch diminutions of
his authority, as that the acts of the Engli&s;h parliament &s;hould not be
binding in Ireland, nor that writs of error and appeals &s;hould be carried
from thence to England. It would, without doubt, have been more
generous in the Iri&s;h, not to have pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard upon their prince,
when he lay &s;o much at their mercy; and more prudent not to have
gra&s;ped at gaining all, before they were &s;ure of keeping what they al|ready
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He gave his royal a&s;&s;ent, with good will, only to the
act for liberty of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>[Mr. Thomas Carte made no extracts, from the memoirs of James,
concerning the tran&s;actions of 1689; probably for the &s;ame rea&s;ons
which induced the editor to content him&s;elf with the preceding; having
<PB N="171" REF="183">
found, among Nairne's papers, the original materials, from which James
compo&s;ed his memoirs for the pre&s;ent year. That prince u&s;ually wrote,
with his own hand, all the occurrences of the times, or examined and
corrected what was written by others. He &s;ometimes wrote down his
in&s;tant reflections and conjectures on the &s;tate of his affairs, and the ex|pected
effects of his mea&s;ures, without waiting to &s;ee what time might
determine. The pen mu&s;t have been con&s;tantly in his hand. The fir&s;t
paper which occurs, relating to the tran&s;actions of this year, is a journal,
in his own hand, containing an account of &s;ome intelligence he received,
when on his journey from Cork to Dublin.</P>
<P>The journal which immediately follows the intelligence, in James's
own hand, contains an account of what pa&s;&s;ed in Ireland, from his land|ing
at Kin&s;ale, on the 12th of March, O. S. 1689, to the 18th of July,
when he prorogued the parliament. There are two copies of it among
Nairne's papers; one in French, and another in Engli&s;h, which is full
of French idioms. The language and orthography of the French copy,
which is in Nairne's hand, is the mo&s;t correct. There are &s;ome ad|ditions
in the margin, by lord Melfort, in French; and &s;everal, by
James him&s;elf, in Engli&s;h. From the mention made of it in James's
in&s;tructions to lord Dover, it appears he intended it for the information
of Lewis XIV. However, the Engli&s;h copy, from which the other is
&s;aid to be a tran&s;lation, is printed here, though corrected in &s;ome few
places according to the French, which is more exact. The additions
are placed in the margin, as they occur in the margin of the French
copy. The variations are carefully marked, and the letters and memo|rials,
from which the journal was framed, are placed at the bottom of
the page, as further illu&s;trations of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>This journal may be reckoned, in a great mea&s;ure, the work of James,
from the corrections, alterations, and additions in his own hand. The
account which he gives, in his memoirs of the military tran&s;actions in
Ireland, during the year 1689, is but an ab&s;tract of what this and the
following journal contain; and the&s;e journals were compo&s;ed from the
letters which James received from his generals; and of which &s;ome are
in&s;erted, as vouchers and illu&s;trations, in the notes.]</P>

<P>THIS morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 7.</NOTE> by letters, and an officer who came from Cavan, had
an account, that Kirke came thither on the 14, in the morning about
&s;even, with &s;ix &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons and fifteen hundred foot,
all of Schomberg's owne army; they marched into the towne, de&s;igning,
as was believed, to attaque the fort on that &s;ide: but brigad. Wachop,
who commanded there, having left &s;ome men in three &s;trong &s;tore-hou&s;es
in the towne, to pre&s;erve it, they obliged the enemie to march out of
it, leaving &s;ix of their men &s;lain in the &s;treet. What others they had
killed or wounded there, is not knowne. There had been greater, if
&s;ome of the prote&s;tant inhabitants had not adverti&s;ed the enemie, as
they were marching on, of &s;ome of Wachop's men being in tho&s;e
hou&s;es; for had they not had that notice, they had come up clo&s;e to
them; our men having had orders from the brigadier, not to fire till
they were ju&s;t under them; and they kept clo&s;e, till they &s;aw the ene|mie
begin to march back, who were come within half mu&s;ket-&s;hot, and
&s;o did that execution on them. After this, they marched up to the
fort on the other &s;ide; but, after viewing it, and having &s;kirmi&s;hed for
&s;ome time, they finding it &s;tronger and better provided than they ex|pected,
marched, about two in the afternone, back for Belturbatt. What
men they lo&s;t on that &s;ide, one cannot certainly &s;ay, only that from the
fort they &s;aw them carry of &s;everal dead bodies on hor&s;e-back befor them.
It's probable their de&s;igne was to take the fort, or to burn the towne,
&s;ince they came with &s;o great a body. They only burnt two &s;mall ca|bins
at the town's end. Wachop writes word he is afraide a &s;mall foot|guard,

of &s;mall &s;hips, which were in the harbour, came on board the Pink;
believing &s;he came from England, to know news, whom capt. Ander&s;on
&s;ecured, and one of the boats they came in. The other boat got away,
and gave the alarm upon &s;hore. Upon which, captain Wat&s;on, capt.
lieut. to col. Tiffany, who was quartered and commanded in that town,
came to board the Pink, with three boats full of &s;oldiers. They let the
captain come up into the &s;hip, and then &s;eized him and the men of the

away. But the Pink's men &s;ired &s;o fa&s;t on them, that one of the boats
cryed for quarter, and rowed on board and yielded. The third got off.
But mo&s;t of her men were killed or wounded. As &s;oon as it was night,
the Pink warped out of the harbour, the wind blowing right in; and,
by that tyme 'twas day, got clear of the mouth of it. The enemy, by
that tyme, got downe to the &s;ea-&s;ide, and on the rocks, in great num|bers.
A regiment of foot being quartered hard by, fired &s;ome &s;mall

about three days, plundered, the country, and brought back with them

put into that harbour; believing it to be in the King's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but no

and right into the harbour, the mouth of which was very narrow, &s;o

<P>HIS Maje&s;ty arrived in his kingdom of Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> the 12 of March,
O. S. 1689; and was received, at Kin&s;ale, where he landed, with
all the demon&s;trations of joy imaginable.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's fir&s;t care was to have the money,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No 6.</NOTE> arms, and ammuni|tion,
which he brought along with him from France, &s;afely landed and
&s;ecured in his fort of Kin&s;ale; and, <HI>becau&s;e one part thereof was &s;ent by
Mr. de Louvois, and the other by Mr. Seignelay, his Maje&s;ty</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The words in Italicks are omitted in the French tran&s;lation.</NOTE> ordered
one of his &s;ervants to receive that of Mr. de Louvois, and to deliver it
to the Sieur de Pointis, that he might take care and give an account
thereof; having, for that end, &s;everal commi&s;&s;aries under him: all
which was done, with great readine&s;s and care, and in a few days.</P>
<P>After this was done, his Maje&s;ty calling into his council the count
d'Avaux, emba&s;&s;ador of France, and the earl of Melford, cau&s;ed him|&s;elf
to be informed, in their pre&s;ence, of the po&s;ture of affairs in this
kingdom, by tho&s;e of the country that were come to wait upon him at
his landing; but chiefly by Sir Thomas Nugent, lord chief ju&s;tice of
<PB N="175" REF="187">
Ireland, and his lieutenant general, the lord Mount Ca&s;hell. He found
by the&s;e, that the lord deputy of Ireland, finding the de&s;igns of the prince
of Orange &s;ucceed &s;o well in England, and that the half of the Iri&s;h
army was there, and con&s;equently lo&s;t for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, had en|deavoured
to &s;upply this defect, by giving commi&s;&s;ions to rai&s;e men,
to all whom either the love of their religion, their King, or their country
incited to accept thereof. That the fidelity of the Iri&s;h, and their zeal
for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, had appeared &s;o extraordinary, on this oc|ca&s;ion,
that, in le&s;s than a month, there were above one hundred thou|&s;and
men on foot. The reputation of which alone, was &s;ufficient to hin|der
the prince of Orange from attempting any thing again&s;t Ireland,
without very great preparations. That this thing alone had &s;aved the
kingdom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The prince of Orange has been much blamed for his long neglect of the affairs of Ireland, and his conduct was variou&s;ly accounted for. Some &s;aid, that he was deceived by Ty$connel's a&s;&s;urances of attachment and fidelity; others affirmed, that he was wil|ling to give the Iri&s;h an opportunity of ri&s;ing in arms, that he might enrich his fol|lowers by for&s;eitures; and tho&s;e who were di&s;po&s;ed to judge with more candor, alleged&punc; that he followed the opinion of the marquis of Hallifax, that an un&s;ettled &s;tate of affairs in Ireland, would compel the Engli&s;h to a &s;peedy &s;ettlement of England. But the writer of this Journal, with le&s;s malignity and re&s;inement, gives another account of the prince's &s;uppo&s;ed inattention.</NOTE>. But that, on the other &s;ide, it was attended with great
inconveniencies; for the troops being rai&s;ed, and having no pay, were
forced to live on the people; and, though the officers had undertaken
to maintain them at their own charge, there were very few that did it:
effectually.</P>
<P>That the lord deputy had done another thing very nece&s;&s;ary for the
&s;afety of Ireland, by di&s;arming, the prote&s;tants and &s;eizing their hor&s;es.
But that too brought inconveniencies along with it, and cau&s;ed &s;o great
di&s;order, that every catholique thought him&s;elfe entitled to pillage the
prote&s;tants, and render back to them the &s;ame u&s;age they had before
received at their hands. This &s;o provoked the prote&s;tants, being already
too much inclined to revolt, that they took occa&s;ion to a&s;&s;emble pub|lickly
for the forming them&s;elves into troops; and committed great di&s;|orders,
particularly in the North and at Banden.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="188">
That the rebels at Banden had been reduced without much difficulty;
and that tho&s;e in the North were &s;o near being &s;o, that it was not doubted
but the fir&s;t news from that country would bring the news of it; and
that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould have no ground to fear any ill con&s;equence from
that &s;ide.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, applying him&s;elf after this to the forming of his army,
gave orders to his lieutenant general, the lord Mount Ca&s;hell, to form
&s;even regiments of foot, of the forces rai&s;ed in tho&s;e quarters, as al&s;o
to arm the regiment of dragoons of Sir James Cottar, and to tran&s;port
the re&s;t of the armes to Dublin, with all &s;peede. Having ordered this,

but gave a general liberty for the tran&s;porting into France, which had been
done in great aboundance, but that ve&s;&s;els were wanted</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The words in Italicks are in&s;erted here in the Engli&s;h text. But they are on the margin of the French text in Lord Melfort's hand.</NOTE>. It was here too
that his Maje&s;ty began to find the difficulty of tran&s;porting his arms and
ammunition, as he de&s;igned, as well by rea&s;on of the unfitne&s;s of the
carriages u&s;ed in the country, as of the ill ways; and that the general
officers and others of his train, having taken all the hor&s;es, and &s;everal
not paying for them, had cau&s;ed the country people to drive what they
<PB N="177" REF="189">
had remaining into the mountains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> from whence it was impo&s;&s;ible to get
them. His Maje&s;ty having remained &s;ome days at Cork, the earl of
Tyrconnel came thither to wait upon him; and was immediately created
Duke, in recompence of his great &s;ervices, and &s;ucce&s;sful endeavours
towards the pre&s;ervation of the kingdom of Ireland. He brought along
with him the news of the rebels being defeated, by Hamilton, at Dro|more;
and that he pur&s;ued them &s;o bri&s;kly, that he hoped to reduce
them entirely, before any recruits could be &s;ent him; and, in this belief,

Dublin.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">A marginal note to the French text in Melfort's hand.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>His Maje&s;ty arriving at Dublin, and finding the troubles in the north
&s;till prolonged, and that he had been but ill informed of the number and
re&s;olution of the rebels, and well knowing of what importance it was to
him, to put an end to the di&s;orders of this Kingdom; he re&s;olved to &s;end
more troops yet to the north, to &s;trengthen tho&s;e with Hamilton. But
his fir&s;t care was to form a council, in which all affairs &s;hould be de|bated;
and re&s;olved it &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of the French amba&s;&s;ador, the duke
of Tyrconnel, and the Earl of Melfort.</P>
<P>It was in this council, where it was con&s;idered, what troops &s;hould
be &s;ent to &s;trengthen the camp of Hamilton, who was not &s;trong enough
to take Coleraine, much le&s;s to attack Derry. It was agreed, that his
Maje&s;ty &s;hould &s;end &s;ome regiments to block up Coleraine, on the other
&s;ide of the river; and that they &s;hould be commanded by the duke of
Berwick and the marquis de Pu&s;ignian. But it happened, that the com|mi&s;&s;ion
of general major, granted to the duke of Berwick, was of an
ancienter date than that of the marquis de Pu&s;ignian. The King, to
<PB N="178" REF="190">
&s;hew the particular e&s;teem he had for the French, on all occa&s;ions, would
not &s;uffer the duke of Berwick to command the marquis, on that occa|&s;ion.
But &s;ent him &s;traight to Hamilton, and left to the marquis the
&s;ole command of the detachment; the troops of which he doubted not
to be in a good condition and fit to march, being the fir&s;t that were
armed of the new levies.</P>
<P>This detachment con&s;i&s;ted of five regiments of foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A marginal note to the French tran&s;|lation in the King's hand. <HI>A mi&s;take as to the troops.</HI></NOTE> that is Bellow,
German&s;towne, Louth, Neugent, and Moore; the duke of Tyrconnell's

commanded by the lord Gallmoy, brigadier, con&s;i&s;ting of one hun|dred and
&s;ixty-five hor&s;e, one hundred dragoons, and five hundred and
&s;ixty foot; which made, in all, with the other troops that were already,
in the North, eleven thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;eventy-eight foot, &s;even
hundred and thirty-five hor&s;e, and &s;even hundred and fifty dragoons;
and, becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty was informed, that the free communication,
that tho&s;e of Coleraine had with tho&s;e of Derry, did very much hinder
the taking of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e places, he commanded Mon&s;ieur de Pu|&s;ignian
to march, with the detachment under his command, betwixt the
two rivers; by that means to hinder their communication for the future.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the troops, thus de&s;tined, prepared them&s;elves for their gene|ral

that were in the kingdom) not being in a condition to march.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de Pu&s;ignian, who was to command the troops de&s;tined for
the recruit of Hamilton, would have deferred his departure to join the

him. But being a&s;&s;ured, that there were &s;ome at Charlemount, both bet|ter

<P>It being there and at Dungannon, where the troops under his com|mand

arrival, but they, being little acquainted with military di&s;cipline, came
two or three days &s;hort, which the Sieur de Pu&s;ignian, not to lo&s;e time,
employed in mounting the two pieces of cannon he found at Charle|mount,
by the workmen which he carried along with him from Dublin.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t things went thus in Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> news was brought from Scotland,
that the convention was a&s;&s;embled at Edinburgh, that the duke of Ha|milton

<P>About this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Ireland.</NOTE> his Maje&s;ty applying him&s;elf ince&s;&s;antly to provide
for the good and welfare of his &s;ubjects of Ireland, and finding that
there were above one hundred thou&s;and men of foot, which were a charge
as well to the people as to the officers who rai&s;ed them, re&s;olved imme|diately
to reduce them to a letter number, and gave his orders to that
effect to the duke of Tyrconnel, who di&s;banding all the re&s;t, re&s;erved
only, according to the King's intentions, &s;even regiments of hor&s;e, of
which one was of nine, three of eight, and three of &s;ix troops; &s;even
regiments of dragoons, of which three of twelve troops, and four of
ten; and thirty-five regiments of foot, of which the regiment of guards
had two battalions, and the re&s;t thirteen companies each, every com|pany
of &s;ixty-two men. Having thus reduced this great army to a more
compact number, his Maje&s;ty gave orders to bring the arms without
delay, that tho&s;e whom he thought fit to be kept on foot might, by re|ceiving
them, be fit for &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Having thus provided for the reform and arming of his forces, and

<P>Whil&s;t Mon&s;ieur de Po&s;ignian a&s;&s;embled his troops nigh Charlemont,
and Hamilton was ordered by his Maje&s;ty to try on his &s;ide to make
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the bridge, which would render the communication
ea&s;y betwixt him and Mon&s;ieur de Pu&s;ignian; which the enimies fear|ing,
they burned the bridge, before we could come at it; but that did
not &s;top his march, and &s;o great was the courage of him&s;elf, his officers,
and the troops he commanded, that mo&s;t of them pa&s;&s;ed the river in the
face of the enimie, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of a redoubt on the
other &s;ide.</P>
<P>As his Maje&s;ty was on the way from Dublin to Charlemont, he re|ceived
news, that the rebels had quitted Coleraine, when they &s;aw that
Hamilton was ma&s;ter of the pa&s;&s;age over the river, and that M. de Pu|&s;ignian
marched to get between them and Derry, and having ruined all
<PB N="182" REF="194">
the country between Coleraine and that place, retired to Derry, and into
the country on the other &s;ide the river Finne.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty &s;tayed &s;ome days at Ardmagh, a town pillaged by the
enimie, and very inconvenient as well for him&s;elf as his train, whil&s;t he
&s;ent Mr. de Rozen and Mr. de Maumont to view the troops at Dungan|non,
and to give him an account of them. A little after he advanced
to Charlemont, from whence he went two days after to vi&s;it the po&s;t of
Dungannon, Mr. de Rozen's quarter. He &s;aw the regiment of Cave|nach
armed half with pikes and half with mu&s;quetts, but &s;o bad and &s;o
much out of order, that not one hundred among&s;t them were in a con|dition
to be &s;hot in; at which his Maje&s;ty was much &s;urpri&s;ed, believing
them to have been in a much better condition, which made him redouble
his orders for bringing the arms from Corke, Kin&s;ale, and Waterford,
with all &s;peed.</P>
<P>Att the &s;ame time the marquis de Pu&s;ignian, in pur&s;uance of the
orders which his Maje&s;ty had &s;ent from Ardmagh to him and Hamilton
to march to Straban (a pa&s;&s;age of the river Finne, at the mouth of which
is &s;ituated, ten miles from thence, the city of Derry), march't with his
detachment within a league of Dungannon, and hearing of his Maje&s;ty's
being there, came to give him an account of the troops which were with
him, and were in little better condition than tho&s;e at Dungannon; which
obliged his Maje&s;ty to reiterate his orders, and write to the duke of
Tyrconnell and the Sieur de Pointis to &s;end away the arms and ammu|nition
with all &s;peed.</P>
<P>The King &s;eeing there was no more enimies left on this &s;ide the river,
except in Inni&s;killin, and that every where, upon the approach of his
troops, the rebels had abandoned the villages and little ca&s;tles, where
they had garri&s;ons, he re&s;olved to go on as far as Omi, being per|&s;uaded
by all tho&s;e who knew the country, that Derry will &s;urrender
upon his approach.</P>
<P>He left Charlemont the fourteenth of April, and arrived the &s;ame
day at Omi; from whence he found that Hamilton was marched for
Straban, and that Mon&s;ieur Pu&s;ignian, with half the troops under his
command, of which the mo&s;t were hor&s;e and dragoons, was advanced
to Cladyford, three or four miles above Straban. His maje&s;ty was al&s;o
informed, that the rebels appeared in great numbers on the other &s;ide
<PB N="183" REF="195">
the river which obliged him to &s;end Mr. de Ro&s;en, Mon&s;ieur de Mau|mont,
and Mon&s;ieur Lery before him, with all the re&s;t of the troops
that were at Omi, except one regiment of foot and one troop of
dragoons, to &s;ee if po&s;&s;ible they could pa&s;s the river at Straban. In the
mean time Hamilton, the duke of Berwick, and Mon&s;ieur de Pu&s;ignian
having joined their troops about Straban, forced the pa&s;&s;age of Clady|ford
with a handful of men in &s;ight of five or &s;ix thou&s;and of the enemy
that were on the other &s;ide to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en not finding them at Straban on his arrival, and
not being willing to &s;top there, went him&s;elf to view the pa&s;&s;age of the
river from Straban to Li&s;&s;ord, and though he had with him only two
troops of hor&s;e and one of dragoons, and that the number of the
enemies on the other &s;ide appeared, and were effectually ten times the
number, he bravely attempted the pa&s;&s;age, and him&s;elf and the general
officers leading the way, his troops followed him with that courage
that they all &s;wam the river; and by &s;o bold an action, &s;o frightened
the enimies, that they fled upon the fir&s;t charge, and pur&s;uing of them
for three or four miles killed many of them.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty judging by this manner of proceeding of the enimies
that they re&s;erved all their efforts for the defending of Derry, and &s;ee|ing
the nece&s;&s;ity there was, to provide things nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;iege,
as al&s;o to reinforce his army, re&s;olved to return to Dublin, and left the
command of his army in the hands of Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en, Mon&s;ieur
Maumont, Hamilton, the duke of Berwick, Pu&s;ignian, and de Lery.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth his Maje&s;ty came back to Charlemont, where he &s;ent
more troops to reinforce the garri&s;on of Coleraine newly taken, as al&s;o
the county of Down, where he was informed that there was a liklihood
of &s;ome &s;tirring of rebels. The night of the &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth
the King received an expre&s;s from the army, which let him know that
the general officers had re&s;olved to re&s;t the troops, the 17th and the 18th,
to join all their troops together and march &s;traight to Derry; and
that it was the general opinion, that in the con&s;ternation in which the
enimies were &s;ince the forcing of the pa&s;&s;ages of the river, the town
would &s;urrender without any re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="196">
The morning of the 17th arrived another expre&s;s &s;ent by the duke of
Berwick, acquainting his Maje&s;ty, that the rebels of Derry had
&s;ent to capitulate with lieutenant general Hamilton, who had &s;ent them
to Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en as his &s;uperior officer, who an&s;wered, that he re|ferred
him&s;elf to the King's declaration<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is a reference here on the margin of the Engli&s;h copy of the Journal to paper 2d. in Mr. Nairne's collection. It is the King's proclamation of the fir&s;t of April, referred to above.</NOTE>, and would allow them the
advantage of it if they forthwith &s;urrendered. Upon which the deputies
of the town went back, promi&s;ing to &s;end their an&s;wer by 10 o'clock
the next morning; and that it was the general opinion, the town would
&s;urrender, and, that he was de&s;ired by the general officers, to inform
his Maje&s;ty, that in their opinion, his pre&s;ence would be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The King who would fail in nothing that might contribute to the
good of his affairs, or the reducing of &s;o important a place, re&s;olved to
go thither; and although he fore&s;aw that the voyage could not be only
trouble&s;ome, but dangerous, yet he would expo&s;e him&s;elf thereto, and
&s;hew thereby the regard he had for the opinion of his general officers:
He knew that thereby his return to Dublin was delayed, where the
main of his bu&s;ine&s;s lay, but having left all his things there to the ma|nagement
of the duke of Tyrconnell, who&s;e care and exactne&s;s in put|ting
the&s;e orders in execution which he had left them, would, he
doubted it not, &s;upply his ab&s;ence; and con&s;idering, on the other &s;ide,
that the re&s;i&s;tance of the town would have been imputed to him, if by
avoiding two or three days of fatigue extraordinary, he had neglected any
expedition which might have had the lea&s;t &s;hadow or probability to re|duce
it; he delayed no longer to return back again, to appear at the
head of his army, within &s;ight of Derry, to di&s;abu&s;e tho&s;e unhappy
rebels of the ob&s;tinate belief which they had entertained, that his Ma|je&s;ty
was not in Ireland, but had died at Bre&s;t, and, that what was &s;aid
to per&s;uade them to the contrary was only to deceive them: therefore
as &s;oon as he had received the duke of Berwick's letter, he &s;et out from
Charlemont, where he left a great part of his train, taking with him
only tho&s;e who were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of his hou&s;hold, as well becau&s;e of
the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions as the general want of forrage, the ruin of
<PB N="185" REF="197">
hor&s;es, and other extremities, which were feared. And after a long and
painful day's journey of thirty miles, he arrived that night very late at
Newtown Stewart, where having re&s;ted three or four hours in his clothes,
he was on hor&s;eback the next morning by break of day, and by
8 o'clock came to Straban, where he received a letter from Mon&s;ieur de
Ro&s;en, which let him know, that the rebels at Derry had again &s;ent to
capitulate for the &s;urrender of the place; and that to induce them to
do it the more readily, he was marched with the whole army to &s;hew
him&s;elf near the town. The &s;ame letter informed him that there were
Engli&s;h &s;hips in the lake, with &s;uccours of &s;oldiers and arms for the
town.</P>
<P>The King, who expected to have found the army at Straban, finding
it march towards Derry, and de&s;iring to overtake it with all &s;peed, &s;topt
not at all, but pa&s;&s;ing the river on hor&s;eback, he overtook the foot,
commanded by Mon&s;ieur de Pu&s;ignian, two miles from Lifford, and
having viewed them without &s;topping, went on to join Mon&s;ieur de
Ro&s;en, who was gone from Straban four hours before his arrival, with
part of the hor&s;e; the re&s;t of the hor&s;e and dragoons being &s;ent a day
before to Raphoe, as well to &s;ave the provi&s;ions which were there in great
abundance, as to con&s;ine the enemies and drive them further into the
Penin&s;ula, had orders to rejoin Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en within &s;ight of Derry,
being commanded by Hamilton and the duke of Berwick.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, having joined Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en, within two miles of
Derry, put him&s;elf with him at the head of his troops, and, marching
&s;traight to the town, &s;topt upon a hill within cannot-&s;hot of the walls.</P>
<P>The place being thus inve&s;ted by the few hor&s;e and dragoons that were
there, Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty to ha&s;ten the march of the
foot that was behind, which coming up but &s;lowly, Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en
pre&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to &s;end back two or three me&s;&s;engers one after ano|ther
to make them advance with all &s;peed, which his Maje&s;ty did.
Mr. de Ro&s;en having po&s;ted the foot round the town, from the &s;ea on the
one &s;ide, by the wind-mill, to the garden and the &s;ea on the other &s;ide,
<HI>the King propo&s;ed to &s;end to &s;ummon the town, that they might know he
was there; to which Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en an&s;wered, that it was not proper to
<PB N="186" REF="198">
do it till all the troops were in battalion in view of the town, and de&s;ired the
King to &s;end to ha&s;ten Hamilton and the foot; in the mean time, he, Mon|&s;ieur
de Ro&s;en, advanced with &s;ome hor&s;e and dragoons, and po&s;ted them in
the bottom within le&s;s than half cannon-&s;hot of the town, they of Derry not
firing one &s;hot at them. His Maje&s;ty, who was re&s;olved to let Mon&s;ieur de
Ro&s;en act as he thought be&s;t, remained on the heighth, where the hor&s;e and
dragoons were fir&s;t drawn up; &s;eeing from thence the foot marching along the
highway in the bottom, went down to meet them; finding Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en
re&s;ting him&s;elf in a large field on the &s;ide of a hill out of cannot-&s;hot, though
in full view of the town, propo&s;ed to him to draw up the foot there, to give
the rebels a full view of them. But Ro&s;en de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty to let him po&s;t
them as he thought be&s;t, to which the King acquie&s;ced and &s;aid no more; but
went down and met the foot in the bottom, and let them follow Mr. de Ro&s;en's
orders, and kept him&s;elf ju&s;t out of cannon-&s;hot from the town, and then &s;ent
a trumpet to &s;ummon it; &s;o that it was not by the King's orders that they
advanced &s;o far. Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en, notwith&s;tanding that, made the troops
advance towards the town, and po&s;t them&s;elves very near it under the &s;helter
of the wind mill, and a hou&s;e near it, and the high enclo&s;ures thereabouts,
and detached others along the bottom towards the Butcher's Gate. Whil&s;t
this was a doing, the trumpeter came back to the King, and told him, the
an&s;wer he had was, that they would in an hour's time &s;end an an&s;wer, but
de&s;ired the troops might not advance further. Whether the trumpeter told
this la&s;t particular to Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en as he came back, is not known;
if he did, Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en took no notice of it, for he did not &s;top the troops

<P>The King had already &s;ent a general officer to command the troops,

&s;aid letters were directed, being known thereby to be friends to his
Maje&s;ty, would be obliged, in their own defence, and for his Maje&s;ty's
intere&s;t, to take up arms, his Maje&s;ty found it convenient to &s;end fre&s;h
letters, with commi&s;&s;ions; and, at the &s;ame time, he publi&s;hed a decla|ration
again&s;t all the members of the convention, and the adherents of
the prince of Orange, as rebels; and gave full power to all his loyal
&s;ubjects to fall upon and de&s;troy them; this being nece&s;&s;ary for autho|ri&s;ing
the actions of his good &s;ervants; &s;ince, by the law of the land,
none can take up arms without the King's authority.</P>
<P>A few days after the King's return to Dublin, his Maje&s;ty received
the ill news of the death of mon&s;ieur de Pu&s;ignian, who was wounded
in a &s;ally made by the rebels of Derry, and died two days after. His
Maje&s;ty was extremely concerned at it; nor could enough regret the lo&s;s
of two &s;uch brave men as mon&s;ieur de Maumont and him, who&s;e courage,
conduct, and obliging manners had gained the love and e&s;teem of all men.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, being &s;till bent upon finding means to put his armies in
a good condition, propo&s;ed the having three camps; that Derry being
taken, the troops on that &s;ide &s;hould camp in the North, toward Scot|land;
that ten regiments &s;hould camp near Dublin, and all the re&s;t of
the army, except the garri&s;ons, betwixt Cork and Kin&s;ale; and that
magazines &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed near each of tho&s;e camps, from whence
the troops &s;hould be furni&s;hed with all things nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

His Maje&s;ty re&s;olving to draw together the hor&s;e and dragoons newly
levied, to &s;end them to &s;everal places in garri&s;on; and, by that means,
to have more men to &s;end to Derry, more &s;traightly to be&s;iege the &s;ame;
having been hitherto, properly &s;peaking, but blocked up; tho&s;e new
levies, when looked into, were found to be only regiments in name,
and not formed or fit for &s;ervice. The duke of Tyrconnell, at his
return from vi&s;iting the troops, acquainted his Maje&s;ty, that he found
among&s;t the infantry &s;o many good men, that he could not think of
di&s;banding them; and therefore, that he had kept up, in &s;ome regiments,
twenty companies, in&s;tead of thirty; and in others, 22 companies,
&amp;c. However, tho&s;e which were di&s;banded, committed &s;trange di&s;or|ders
every where; for the preventing of which, his Maje&s;ty erected &s;e|veral
provo&s;t martials in all the provinces of the kingdom, to re&s;train
and puni&s;h the authors of &s;uch di&s;orders without delay. He gave or|ders
al&s;o for &s;eizing the goods of ab&s;ent prote&s;tants and rebels, making
u&s;e, for that purpo&s;e, of the mo&s;t effectual means which the laws of
the country permitted, and going even beyond that where the occa&s;ion
required.</P>
<P>The King, con&s;idering the trade was lo&s;t, and all commerce broke off
with England, re&s;olved to give out commi&s;&s;ions of privateers to all tho&s;e
who would take them; giving &s;everal to tho&s;e of St. Malo, which he had
done much &s;ooner, if he had not con&s;idered, that after beginning to
take the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els, it would be no longer ea&s;y for him to have any

to the good of his affairs.</P>
<P>All traffick being thus broke of, and the tran&s;porting of wool, hides,

his Maje&s;ty found an expedient, by which trade might yet go on with

as de&s;ired to trade for the advantage of the country and their own intere&s;t,

The re&s;i&s;tance of Derry had encourged &s;everal of the rebels, and

make excur&s;ions into, and de&s;troy the neighbouring country, when his

killed on the &s;pot, and the re&s;t di&s;per&s;ed. Upon which, that country
being a little more &s;ecure from the enemy's attempts, Boughan had or|ders
to march with his troops to Derry. A few days after, the King
received the welcome news of the arrival of the French fleet, in the
bay of Bantrey, and of the fight they had with the Engli&s;h, who were
beaten and put to flight with as much ignominy, as they had, with in&s;o|lence,
and di&s;re&s;pect to the law of nations, attacked them. This ar|rival
of the fleet, which brought a &s;upply of officers, arms, and money;
and which was followed with &s;o glorious a victory, filled the court with
a general &s;atisfaction; and the whole city expre&s;&s;ed their joy for it with
bonfires. His Maje&s;ty, who had expected this fleet, with the French
officers, a month before, had given orders, when he went to the North,
to all the &s;eaports, intimating how he would have them received at
their arrival. He had kept for the mo&s;t of them places vacant in the
regiments, though not without difficulty, con&s;idering that the officers
who had rai&s;ed the &s;aid regiments, had placed the &s;ubalterns, who were,
for the mo&s;t part, their relations, and had maintained them $ive months at
their own expences. His Maje&s;ty &s;ent orders to bring the French officers

to Bantrey, to bring from thence the arms to Dublin, with all po&s;&s;ible
diligence. But the country being full of mountains, and a de&s;ert where
they were landed, the di&s;tance, and the want of all &s;orts of carriages,
and not daring to venture them any more at &s;ea, was the cau&s;e of their
arriving but very &s;lowly. Whil&s;t they were a-coming, his Maje&s;ty di&s;|patched
to Derry two cannon, one great mortar, with bombs and ammu|nition,
and two battalions of the regiment of Eu&s;tace, being all that was

&s;hould, for the future, be paid regularly; and for that end an exact li&s;t

France would, either by them&s;elves, or others appointed by them, make
mu&s;ters much more exact and true; for this rea&s;on, without having

regulated, who had hitherto received no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; having been given
only to the &s;oldiers, at the rate of eighteen pence <HI>per</HI> week to the foot,
and of five and forty pence half-penny to the hor&s;e, and &s;ix and thirty
pence to the dragoons. This being regulated, and the account of the
mu&s;ters examined, it was re&s;olved to compleat the full payment of the
month of May to the whole army, defaulting what they had received
<HI>a bon compt;</HI> and as his Maje&s;ty had not yet e&s;tabli&s;hed a method for
receiving the money which came out of France, but &s;eeing that the
amba&s;&s;ador was willing to take the trouble of it upon him&s;elf, his Ma|je&s;ty
left it entirely in his hands, requiring none but as he had occa&s;ion

nece&s;&s;ities of the army, which required a &s;peedy remedy, could not be
relieved time enough. All the&s;e rea&s;ons made his Maje&s;ty re&s;olve to
coin certain pieces of copper, which &s;hould go and be received as &s;ilver;
and this, after having weighed all the inconveniencies which could hap|pen
thereby, was found the only expedient capable of &s;erving the army,
in the want to which it was reduced; not having yet received &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
for the whole month of May, nor any means left to find in the whole
kingdom wherewith to pay them the half of the month of June; and
it being of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the good of his Maje&s;ty's affairs,
that he &s;hould keep &s;ome two hundred thou&s;and livres, which yet re|mained
of the French money, in ca&s;e his Maje&s;ty &s;hould have occa&s;ion
thereof for England or Scotland, or for intelligence and other things of
that nature; pieces of copper, worth &s;ix pence, were therefore begun to
be coined, which is continued every day; nor can enough be made for
the payment of the army, which is very well &s;atisfied with them; and
they pa&s;s now in the country without difficulty.</P>
<P>All this time, the parliament was employed in making acts nece&s;&s;ary
for the good of the kingdom, for the rai&s;ing, of money, and for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing
liberty of con&s;cience, &s;uch as might give no cau&s;e of di&s;content
to his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in his other kingdoms.</P>
<P>At Derry, the re&s;i&s;tance of the rebels continuing, they made &s;everal
$allies; in one of which, colonel Ram&s;ay, who commanded the troops
that were furthe&s;t advanced, having begun his work too late, the nights
<PB N="197" REF="209">
being extremely &s;hort, was perceived by tho&s;e of the town, who fell
upon him, before he could put his work in a condition of defence; &s;o
that, overcome by a great number of the enemies, he was beat back,
with the lo&s;s of thirty men, and him&s;elf killed fighting bravely. He
was a very good officer, and one whom the King regretted extreamly.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty &s;eeing that the &s;iege of Derry was likely to continue yet
&s;ome time, and that the rebels of Inni&s;killin grew &s;tronger every day, and
becoming more and more in&s;olent, pillaging and de&s;troying all the neigh|bouring
country, he &s;ent three regiments of foot, $ive troops of hor&s;e,
and one of dragoons, under the command of mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en, who had
orders to &s;traiten tho&s;e of Inni&s;killing, and to force them further towards
Derry, as he &s;hould &s;ee occa&s;ion; doing therein what he &s;hould judge
mo&s;t proper for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice and intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The marquis de Ro&s;en,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> following his Maje&s;ty's orders, marched, the
day of June, from Dublin to Trim, where he remained until
he had received all the arms, that the King could &s;end him for the
arming of his troops, &s;o as to put them in a condition to &s;erve. He
was advanced as far as Cavan, on his way to Inni&s;killing, when his Ma|je&s;ty
had the news, that the Engli&s;h appeared in the lake before Derry,
which obliged him to &s;end him orders to march forthwith towards that
place, that being near it, he might be able either to &s;upport general
Hamilton, by &s;ending him &s;ome part of his troops, or to go and take
the command of the &s;iege him&s;elf; that being left to his prudence to
determine as he thought fit, and as the juncture of affairs &s;hould
require.</P>
<P>Having received his orders, he marched immediately from Cavan, and
made &s;uch ha&s;te, that he came time enough to be at the camp at Derry,
before the Engli&s;h had attempted either to land or relieve the town<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De Ro&s;en,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. N. vol. i. fol.

Legaurey, 13th June&mdash;He gives the King an account of the intelligence &s;ent to him by Hamilton.&mdash;The Engli&s;h fleet had attempted, the preceding day, to enter the lake.&mdash;Both Hamilton's forces and his own were few in number, oppre&s;&s;ed with fatigue, and wanted arms; whereas the Engli&s;h fleet had brought arms in abundance; and as the rebels in that di&s;trict amounted to 20,000 men, be&s;ides the Inni&s;killiners, who were already very well armed, a con&s;iderable army would &s;oon appear in the North. He had fore&s;een this long ago, and therefore di&s;approved of forming the &s;iege of Derry with &s;uch a &s;mall, ill-armed body of men; and now intreats his Maje&s;ty to a&s;&s;emble more troops, and march them towards Derry, according to the plan which he and the French amba&s;|&s;ador had laid before him. Dungannon, 15 June&mdash;He gives the King extraordinary in|$$ances of the negligence and want of di&s;cipline in the troops.&mdash;He excepts only one of|ficer, and propo&s;es; to break &s;everal.&mdash;He had entered, that morning, into Charlemont.&mdash;The governour, tho' he had been advi&s;ed the day before of Ro&s;en's coming, had &s;tept in his country-hou&s;e; all the officers and &s;oldiers, except a few who were in the fields, watching the duke of Berwick and general Hamilton's hor&s;es, were in bed.&mdash;He complains of the want of tents, $orage, ammunition, and nece&s;&s;aries of every kind.&mdash;He was obliged to let loo&s;e the hor&s;es at night, to pa&s;ture in the fields; and had not a &s;urgeon to take care of the &s;ick and wounded.</NOTE>.
<PB N="198" REF="210">
In the mean time, his Maje&s;ty, not being willing to leave the po&s;t of
Belturbatt unguarded, &s;ince it was of great con&s;equence for &s;traitening
the rebels in Inni&s;killing, he &s;ent thither two regiments of foot and one
of dragoons, and two troops of hor&s;e, under the command of colonel
Sutherland, brigadier of his forces, whom his Maje&s;ty commanded to
keep corre&s;pondence with Sarsfield, who was, with three troops of hor&s;e,
one of dragoons, and three battalions of foot, within twelve miles of
Inni&s;killing, on the other &s;ide, in a place which covered all the country
towards the South. Sutherland marched &s;traight to Belturbatt, where
he received orders from mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en to march towards Omi, to
&s;ecure the troops employed in the &s;iege of Derry on that &s;ide. He im|mediately
obeyed his orders, and went for Omi; leaving only two hun|dred
and fifty men at Belturbatt. The rebels of Inni&s;killing, &s;eeing his
march, endeavoured to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of a narrow pa&s;s to hinder it;
but Sutherland having notice, marched all night, and got there before
them; who &s;eeing them&s;elves prevented, and di&s;appointed of their de|&s;ign,
re&s;olved to return and attack tho&s;e men he left behind at Beltur|batt,
which they did, and had not much difficulty to &s;ucceed; they
being neither numerous enough, nor having any fortification, which might
enable them to make any great re&s;i&s;tance, they were all taken pri&s;oners,
before the &s;uccours which his Maje&s;ty &s;ent could arrive; tho', in the
moment he heard of colonel Sutherland's march, he &s;ent the regiment of
Bophin, two troops of hor&s;e, and two troops of dragoons to that
place.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="211">
His Maje&s;ty being adverti&s;ed from &s;everal hands, that a great many
hor&s;es and a great quantity of arms, belonging to the rebels, were con|cealed
in Dublin, it was re&s;olved in council, that &s;earch &s;hould be made
for them; and it was referred to Mr. de Ro&s;en to do it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This ju&s;tifies the an&s;wer which James gave to D'Avaux's memorial. It may be &s;een among the papers of this year.</NOTE>. This order
was ready to be put in execution, when his Maje&s;ty received advice by
a &s;py, that the rebels had a de&s;ign to &s;end letters into England, which
the &s;py him&s;elf was to carry. His Maje&s;ty thought it nece&s;&s;ary to inter|cept
tho&s;e letters, and to &s;ecure the writers of them; and therefore it
was re&s;olved, by the advice of the French amba&s;&s;ador and the re&s;t of his
council, that the &s;earch for arms &s;hould be referred for two or three days;
and, in that time, five of the con&s;pirators were apprehended. But there
appearing every day new accomplices of the trea&s;on, the examination of
it took up time, and his Maje&s;ty being obliged, at that time, to &s;end
Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en towards Inni&s;killing, the &s;earch of the arms was re|ferred
to lord Mount Ca&s;hell, who having repre&s;ented the di&s;order it
would cau&s;e, and the little probability there was of finding any arms by
that means, and the duke of Tyrconnel being of the &s;ame opinion, his
Maje&s;ty let that de&s;ign alone for this time; re&s;olving, however, to put it
in execution upon the fir&s;t favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>The camp de&s;igned near Dublin was marked out by his Maje&s;ty, the
wood and &s;traw for the barracks prepared; but the money falling &s;hort,
it was not found expedient to have &s;o many raw &s;oldiers, with officers
equally unexperienced, drawn together, without either money or arms to
give them; and whil&s;t arms were prepared, and ways contrived to find
money, the news from the North quite broke the de&s;ign of the camp,
and, other mea&s;ures were taken; Mon&s;. de Ro&s;en being &s;ent one way,
Sutherland another, and three regiments &s;traight to Derry by the way of
Charlemont.</P>
<P>As for the camp nigh Cork, it was not to be thought of, there being
&s;carce troops left in Mun&s;ter for the garri&s;ons, all the re&s;t having been
&s;ent to Derry. At this time his Maje&s;ty hearing that the rebels began
to rai$e, taxes in England, found it nece&s;&s;ary, to put forth his Declara|tion
of the 28th of June, by which he forbids the rai&s;ing or paying
<PB N="200" REF="212">
thereof, as al&s;o the impri&s;oning any of his good &s;ubjects, declaring &s;uch
as &s;hould be guilty to be liable to be pro&s;ecuted for fal&s;e impri&s;onment,
and &s;ued for five pound <HI>per</HI> hour, the penalty inflicted by the act, in
&s;uch ca&s;es where any is re&s;trained of his liberty again&s;t law.</P>
<P>The news from the camp before Derry gave, at this time, very good
hopes of its being &s;oon in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's forces. The
&s;hort account of the progre&s;s of that &s;iege is this:</P>
<P>The great guns and mortars arrived not at the camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Lon|donderry.</NOTE> till the thirtieth
of May, and till then little was done again&s;t the town, except beating
them back when they ventured to &s;ally, and firing with what guns we
had upon them, which, however, did con&s;iderable execution.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the guns and mortars were arrived, and more forces come
up, the &s;iege was carried on more clo&s;ely, and on the fourth of June, it
being judged nece&s;&s;ary to take from the enemy a wind-mill, which they
had &s;ecured with &s;everal intrenchments, general Bouchan was commanded
to attack it with two battalions of foot, which he did with much bra|very;
but the rebels having drawn out almo&s;t their whole garri&s;on for
the defence of it, and &s;ome of the foot not going &s;o heartily on as was
expected, he was obliged to retire, having lo&s;t &s;everal officers in the
action, and colonel Dorrington and &s;everal others being wounded. Some
Engli&s;h &s;hips began now to appear in the loch near the town, and it
was known for certain, that they expected more, on board of which
Kirk was, with three regiments, to try to relieve the town. Upon which
a boom was laid acro&s;s the river to prevent their coming up; and in
the mean time the general endeavoured to carry on his works, &s;o as to
cut off from the rebels the &s;prings from whence they had their fre&s;h
water.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, on the eight of June, &s;ent a &s;mall frigate, the Gray|hound,
with two ketches, to endeavour to get &s;ome &s;upply$ into the
town; but the frigate was &s;tranded near Killmore, and before &s;he could
get of, had &s;everal &s;hots in her from the guns the general had &s;ent for
that purpo&s;e, which had certainly beat her to pieces, but that the gun|ners
were none of the be&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 13th, the enemy's whole fleet appeared in the loch; and
came to anchor near Killmore; but the general had &s;o &s;ecured the river
<PB N="201" REF="213">
with booms, and &s;o po&s;ted the forces on each &s;ide with cannon, that
they could not attempt coming up the river, without being certainly de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate things continued; the fleet attempting nothing, and his
Maje&s;ty's forces carrying on their works again&s;t the town, as fa&s;t as the
ill weather, and the other inconveniencies, under which they laboured,
would permit them: but the battalions growing very thin, as well by the
&s;oldiers de&s;erting as falling &s;ick, and the Engli&s;h being expected to land,
Mr. de Ro&s;en was ordered to march thither with what forces he had,
which he did; and it being left in his choice to take the care of the
&s;iege upon him, he left it to Hamilton, po&s;ting him&s;elf &s;o as to hinder
any de&s;cent from the fleet<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The mare&s;chal de Ro&s;en arrived in the camp before Londonderry the 17th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. N. vol. i. fol.

It is not his fault, nor Hamilton's, that the town delays to &s;urrender, &startq;and as every minute of time is precious to us now, I wi&s;h we may not hereafter have rea&s;on to regret tho&s;e we lo&s;e here, and that the &s;uccours which we expect from your Maje&s;ty, and which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us, may not arrive too late.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The duke of Berwick was now &s;ent to Donnegall, where the rebels
began to a&s;&s;emble, and he charged them with that courage and &s;ucce&s;s,
that he entirely routed them, taking a great booty of cattle and &s;heep,
be&s;ides four&s;core hor&s;es and much provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Our works went &s;till but &s;lowly on, until the latter end of the month;
nor could we beat down the enemy's defences, for want of cannon,
which we were forced to employ at the river &s;ide in ca&s;e the fleet &s;hould
attempt any thing. But provi&s;ions began now to grow &s;o &s;carce in the
town<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Walker in a letter to Kirk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol.

<P>A letter of the &s;ame date,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 21.</NOTE> &s;igned by three citizens, was &s;ent to Kirk, inclo&s;ed in Wal|ker's.

They complain of &s;ickne&s;s, mortality, and de&s;ertion; and pray to be relieved by a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, and to have a governour if the &s;iege is not rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Walker, Baker, and five of the citizens, wrote a letter of the &s;ame date, to the Eng|li&s;h fleet.&mdash;They mention the effect which the appearance of the fleet in the lake, and their delaying &s;ince that time to relieve the town, has had upon the enemy.&mdash;They are afraid of being undermined.&mdash;They have not provi&s;ions, including hor&s;e-fle&s;h, for eight days. In the name of 20,000 di&s;tre&s;&s;ed prote&s;tants, &s;hut up in the city, on account of their loyalty and per&s;everance, they pray to be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, e&s;pecially bi&s;|cuit, chee&s;e, and butter, as they have no fire to dre&s;s meat. &startq;We have &s;allied out and engaged the enemy, three &s;everal times, and put them to a di&s;honourable and &s;hameful retreat, in which two French officers, Pu&s;ignian and Maumont, were killed, who were hugely lamented in their camp. Be&s;ides, &s;everal Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h officers of $on&s;iderable note, viz. Brigadier general Ram&s;ay killed la&s;t engagement, colonel Nugent, colonel Farrel, captain Wat&s;on, an Engli&s;h gentleman, taken pri&s;oner, but &s;ince dead of his wounds; brigadier Talbot, formerly called Wicked Will, and nephew to Tyrconnel, taken, and dead and buried this day of his wounds. We were offered five hundred guineas for his ran&s;om, but in regard of your arrival would accept of no terms. We have now the lord vi&s;count Neterville, Sir Garret Aylmer, major Rowcomon, and a great many others of le&s;&s;er note, pri&s;oners, taken fir&s;t engagement: and at the la&s;t, we have captain Butler, &s;on to the earl of Mount Garret; one of the great Mac Donnells, a captain, and captain Mac Donnagh, and many others too long to name.&mdash;We killed and wounded la&s;t engagement 800 of their men, many of whom were officers; colonel Dorrington, colonel Gordon, O Neile, lieutenant colonel Eu&s;tace, captain Plunket, and many others, were carried of by their hor&s;e.&mdash;We have got &s;even pair of colours from the enemy.&mdash;If you do not &s;end us relief, we mu&s;t &s;urrender the garri&s;on within &s;ix or &s;even days.&mdash;We under&s;tand that the boom is certainly broke, &s;o that you may come up with ea&s;e.&endq;</P></NOTE>, that on the 29th they talked of &s;urrendering, and propo&s;ed
<PB N="202" REF="214">
conditions; but it was thought their aim was, thereby to gain time, &s;till
expecting relief from the fleet. The day before, the King's forces beat
them from two retrenchments, they had made without the gate; but
being there expo&s;ed to the continual fire of the enemies from the wall,
they quitted them, &s;ome officers being killed and &s;ome wounded on that
occa&s;ion, and particularly Mon&s;. d'Angleu&s;e.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de Ro&s;en, at this time, formed a project, which he had in
part put in execution before he acquainted his Maje&s;ty with it; which was
to a&s;&s;emble all the people left in the country from Charlemont and a va&s;t
way round, men, women, and children, and drive them to the walls of the
town, where they &s;hould be left to &s;tarve, except the town &s;hould either
<PB N="203" REF="215">
&s;urrender or relieve them. But his Maje&s;ty being informed thereof was
&s;en&s;ible this action could not but be every way prejudicial to his &s;ervice,
&s;ince mo&s;t of the&s;e people living at home peaceably, and having either
his particular protections, or relying on that general one of his declara|tions,
promi&s;ing &s;afety to all that would return to their hou&s;es and live
quiet: this was inevitably to depopulate and ruin the country, and be&s;ides
would give his enemies occa&s;ion &s;o to repre&s;ent &s;uch a breach of faith in
his other kingdoms, as to di&s;hearten even his be&s;t friends. His Maje&s;ty
therefore immediately di&s;patched away couriers to all the places where
Mon&s;. de Ro&s;en had &s;ent orders to a&s;&s;emble the&s;e poor people, com|manding
governours to forbear from doing it at their utmo&s;t peril; and
at the &s;ame time commanded Mon&s;. de Ro&s;en to de&s;i&s;t from any &s;uch
attempt. He had, however, before his ma&s;ter's orders could reach him,
a&s;&s;embled above four thou&s;and men, women and children, which he
cau&s;ed to be driven to the walls; but &s;o little effect had this proceeding
towards per&s;uading the town to &s;urrender, that they fired upon them
from the walls, which Mon&s;. de Ro&s;en perceiving, drew them off and
&s;ent them to their homes again. The enemy endeavoured to &s;end away
in this crowd many of their &s;ick and weak men; which would have
been of great advantage to them in &s;aving their provi&s;ions.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Mare&s;chal de Ro&s;en, in a Letter to King James, dated at the camp before London|derry, 27th June 1689,&mdash;begins to di&s;cover the impatience which betrayed him into the barbarity of which James complains in this part of his Journal.</P>

N. vol. i. fol. 23.</NOTE> from the impo&s;&s;ibility of continuing in the trenches, which are filled both by the tide and by the continual rains, which mu&s;t entirely de&s;troy your Maje&s;ty's troops before this place, and my zeal and attachment for your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and for pre&s;erving your army, have induced me to-day to deter|mine to exterminate all the rebels throughout this country, as your Maje&s;ty may &s;ee by the copy of the declaration which I have made to tho&s;e who de&s;end the town. I cannot do any thing that will more effectually &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this country, and prevent them from penetrating into the heart of the kingdom. The&s;e rebels have carried their re&s;i&s;tance and ob&s;tinacy &s;o far, that they are totally unworthy of your Maje&s;ty's clemency, and de&s;erve to be &s;tarved to death. Be&s;ides, when the country is plundered and burnt, the Engli&s;h troops who may make a de&s;cent, finding neither &s;ub&s;i&s;tence nor &s;helter, mu&s;t peri&s;h in a mi&s;erable manner; and we &s;hall be in a better condition to maintain our &s;u|periority in the other parts of the kingdom. I am to begin in&s;tantly, Sire, to put my project in execution, and I &s;hall continue the &s;ame plan, unle&s;s your Maje&s;ty forbids me expre&s;sly.&mdash;In that ca&s;e I humbly be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty may be plea&s;ed to clear me of the con&s;equences, and to tru&s;t the entire management of affairs to Mr. Hamilton, or to &s;ome other general officer whom your Maje&s;ty may choo&s;e to employ.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;The $ebels of Londonderry augmenting every day their ob&s;tinacy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 25.</NOTE> which can no longer be endured, I have re&s;olved to gather together all the rebels of this country, and to conduct them to camp, and afterwards drive them under the walls of the town that they may &s;tarve. You are to give them no more &s;ub&s;i&s;tence than will be barely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport them this length from the places where they &s;hall be taken. And as I have certain information, that a con&s;iderable number of the rebels of Londonderry and of this di&s;trict, e&s;pecially their wives and children, have retired to Belfa&s;t, and the neighbouring places; and as the hardine&s;s of their hu&s;bands de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ements, I write this letter to acquaint you, that you are in&s;tantly to make an exact re&s;earch, in Belfa&s;t and its neighbourhood, after &s;uch &s;ubjects as are rebellious to the will of the King, whether men, women, boys or girls, without exception, and whether they are protected or unpro|tected, and to arre&s;t them and collect them together, that they may be conducted by a detachment to this camp, and driven under the walls of Londonderry, where they &s;hall be allowed to &s;tarve in &s;ight of the rebels within the town, unle&s;s they chu&s;e to open their ports to them, which they &s;hall be at liberty to do, if they are di&s;po&s;ed to pity them. Do not fail to exert your&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in executing the&s;e orders punctually, and with|out delay, and at the ri&s;k of being per&s;onally an&s;werable to me for your diligence; and you are to be particularly careful, that none of the rebels, whether men or boys, women or girls, or infants, of whatever age, &s;hall pa&s;s the river and e&s;cape the way of Charle|mont, to &s;ave them&s;elves from the wretchedne&s;s to which they are to be reduced.</P>
<P>&startq;You are to intimate to the inhabitants of Port Patrick the orders you have received, and to declare to them, that they &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly be treated with the &s;ame rigour unle&s;s they remain quiet.

<P>The an&s;wer of the inhabitants of Londonderry to a paper they had received from lieu|tenant general Hamilton, dated the 29th of June, and to the declaration of mare&s;chal de Ro&s;en, dated the 30th of June, is in the following terms:</P>
<Q>The an&s;wer of the governours, commanders, officers, and &s;oldiers, in the city of Londonderry, the 2d of July 1689, to a paper of his excellency lieutenant general Hamilton, dated the 29th of June la&s;t.</Q>
<P>&startq;That we having received and read the &s;aid paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 26. marked on the back, Paper XVIII.</NOTE> and con&s;idering of it, with other offers made to us by the &s;aid lieutenant general, in our council, and with others here, that we might the better give him a $itting an&s;wer; but before we could get the &s;aid matter fully con&s;idered and brought about, which was much hindered by the death of one of our governours, by di&s;turbance given us from the camp, we had &s;ent us a paper, &s;ealed and &s;igned by the mare&s;chal de Ro&s;en, dated $&s;t in&s;tant, by which he declares, that in ca&s;e we do not, betwixt that time and Monday following by &s;ix of the clock in the afternoon, agree to &s;urrender the city unto the King, upon &s;uch conditions as &s;hould be granted us, by lieutenant general Hamilton, according to his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions; that the &s;aid mar&s;hal would forthwith i&s;&s;ue forth his order, from the barony of Innis Owen and the &s;ea-coa&s;ts round about, as far as Charlemont, for gathering together tho&s;e of our faction (as he calls them) whether protected or not, and cau&s;e them immediately to be brought to our walls, where we may receive them into the town, if we have any pity; otherwi&s;e we will be forced to &s;ee our friends and neare&s;t relations all &s;tarved for want of food, he having re&s;olved not to leave one of them at home, nor any thing to main|tain them on: and, that all hopes of &s;uccours may be taken away, by landing of any troops in the&s;e ports from England, he further declares, that, if we do not, by that time, &s;ubmit, he will forthwith cau&s;e all the &s;aid country to be de&s;troyed, by burning the hou&s;es, mills, &amp;c.; and carry all provi&s;ions of the &s;aid country to &s;uch places as he &s;hall think &s;it, and the re&s;t he will de&s;troy. So that our relations, country people, men, women and children mu&s;t &s;tarve, though protected; with other cruel threatenings in the &s;aid paper held forth: which paper of the &s;aid mare&s;chal, we had openly read in our fa|milies. It gave great offence to the people here; and cau&s;ed many of them believe, that no articles or capitulation, that &s;hould be made with us, &s;hould ever be performed or kept; when they find and believe, that the &s;aid mare&s;chal hath, or pretends to have, a power of command, in the army, above the &s;aid lieutenant general, and that he threat|ens to break the protections already given to the prote&s;tants, and u&s;e them in manner afore&s;aid; and that, though we &s;hould have &s;ufficient articles, from the &s;aid lieutenant general, to &s;ave our lives, religion, liberties, and e&s;tates, yet on landing of any army from England, to invade Ireland, our articles &s;hould be broken, our&s;elves impri&s;oned or driven from home, and our goods, chattels, and provi&s;ions taken from us, and we forced to &s;tarve. That, though we expect favour from his Maje&s;ty and the &s;aid lieutenant ge|neral, and others with them; yet we expect no mercy, nor favour, or keeping of condi|tions with us, from the &s;aid mare&s;chal or his countrymen with him; (if he and they &s;hall have power, they having cruel de&s;igns) as their countrymen have, again&s;t the laws, the liberty, and the religion of all men of our church and per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;That, on viewing and con&s;idering the copy of the commi&s;&s;ion, granted by the King to the &s;aid lieutenant general, to treat with us, we find it bears date the fir&s;t of May la&s;t; &s;ince which time, to wit, on the fourteenth of the &s;aid month, there &s;at a parliament in Dublin, by act whereof our lives and e&s;tates were forfeited; wherefore we conceive, that the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion, granted to the &s;aid lieutenant general, hath not &s;ufficient autho|rity for him to treat with us, nor can we, by articles to be made with him, be &s;afe. We, therefore, de&s;ire the &s;aid lieutenant general will (con&s;idering this matter is &s;o dear and near to us, it being all the &s;ecurity we have for our lives, religion, liberty, and e&s;tates) not con&s;true this any delay in our treaty; but that he would be plea&s;ed to pro|cure from his Maje&s;ty a new fuller commi&s;&s;ion to treat with us: and that his Maje&s;ty may a&s;&s;ure us, that we &s;hall have performances of what articles we make with the &s;aid lieute|nant general; &s;o that it may not be in the power of the &s;aid mare&s;chal, or the &s;aid French|men with him, or any other, to break what articles &s;hall be made for our advantage, or that we &s;hall be oppre&s;&s;ed by them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIRE,</SALUTE>
Camp before Londonderry, <DATE>5th July 1689.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I am grieved to &s;ee &s;o little attention given to the execution of your Maje&s;ty's orders, at a time, when matters are become trouble&s;ome and embarra&s;&s;ed. Kirk is always at his po&s;t, waiting the arrival of three regiments of cavalry and two of infantry, which are to join him under the command of Charles Count Schomberg. There is no doubt' but this expectation has kept him from making any attempt to throw provi&s;ions into Derry, as he might ea&s;ily have done by hazarding &s;ome ve&s;&s;els for that end; yet your troops, which have been lately &s;ent, have arrived almo&s;t in the &s;ame condition with the former, having been obliged to take &s;uch arms as were given them, the greate&s;t part of which are damaged and broken, and accordingly u&s;ele&s;s, as you have not in all your army a &s;ingle gun-&s;mith to mend them.</P>
<P>The troops which are here with Hamilton, are in a &s;till wor&s;e condition, and the re|giments entirely lo&s;t and ruined; the &s;tronge&s;t battalion having but two hundred men, and more than two thirds of them without &s;words, belts, or bandaliers. The cavalry and dragoons are not the better, that they are the more numerous, as the &s;tronge&s;t com|pany has but twelve or fourteen troopers able to &s;erve. The river which divides your army and prevents a communication, dimini&s;hes it con&s;iderably. The detachment under the duke of Berwick's command, being more than thirty miles from this place, weakens it entirely, as he cannot leave the po&s;t which he has been obliged to take, without allow|ing the Inn&s;killiners to po&s;&s;e&s;s it and to &s;hut us up behind. All this, Sire, together with the embarra&s;&s;ment of the artillery and carriages which are here, with very little means of conveying them in a country, where one is nece&s;&s;arily obliged to go by one road which is very bad, &s;hould induce your Maje&s;ty to adopt a mea&s;ure, which is of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence to the good of your &s;ervice. It is for this rea&s;on, I humbly be&s;eech you to con&s;ider this maturely, and to &s;end me in&s;tantly your orders about what we &s;hould do; as I had already the honour to a&s;k by my two la&s;t letters, to which I have yet received no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I cannot comprehend how, the regiment of Walter Butler could be &s;ent away from Dublin without &s;words and without powder and ball. I am &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed, that Bagnel's regiment has been employed to e&s;cort the trea&s;ure, without giving them a &s;ingle &s;hot, although, as the officers told, me, they frequently a&s;ked, without being able to obtain any; yet, Sire, they both of them marched two days quite clo&s;e to the garri&s;on of Inni&s;killin, in danger of falling a prey to them. The garri&s;on of Belturbat is in the &s;ame &s;ituation; having had, as Sutherland told me, but a little powder, and not a &s;ingle ball. My heart bleeds, Sire, when I reflect on the continuance of this negligence, &s;ince it ap|pears to me, that no one is in any pain about the ruin of your affairs. I hope, that the return of this expre&s;s will bring me your Maje&s;ty's ultimate orders; and I wi&s;h they may arrive in time enough for me to put them properly in execution; having no other object but to &s;how you my zeal and attachment for your &s;ervice; becau&s;e I am, with a very profound re&s;pect, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and loyalty,</P>

<HEAD>It appears from another letter from de Ro&s;en of the &s;ame date, that he had by that time received from the King an an&s;wer to his letter of June 30th, and his Maje&s;ty's order, forbidding him to put his project in execution. He pre&s;umes to blame James for his clemency, and attempts to ju&s;tify his own conduct.</HEAD>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIRE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have received the letter which your Maje&s;ty did me the honour to write to me the 3d in&s;tant, by which I &s;ee that your Maje&s;ty is always full of benevolence towards the rebels of this kingdom: their own conviction of this encourages them in in&s;olence, to which they are carried every day, and in the hopes that your Maje&s;ty will have com|pa&s;&s;ion upon them in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which, they may be reduced; yet the troops are ruined, and the rebels will receive relief, which will oblige your Maje&s;ty to abandon every thing. I imagined that I might have induced them to &s;urrender, by threatening them as I have done, but that has produced no effect. It is true, I have not put my pro|ject in execution, and that perhaps is the rea&s;on why we are not yet further advanced; for I have pre&s;ented before their gates but a &s;mall number of their accomplices, to try if that would make any impre&s;&s;ions on them; but they have had the cruelty to fire upon them, and to refu&s;e them every kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for which rea&s;on I &s;ent them back to their habitations, after having made them comprehend the difference between your Maje&s;ty's clemency and the cruel treatment of their own party.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conform to the orders your Maje&s;ty has done me the honour to &s;end me, to &s;tay in the army and to de&s;troy the neighbourhood of Londonderry, in ca&s;e Mr. Hamilton $$all be obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege.&endq;</P>
<P>Ro&s;en continued to repre&s;ent to James, that the fleet of the enemy encrea&s;ed, and his Maje&s;ty's forces dimini&s;hed every day; he conveyed to him a letter from the governour of Charlemont, and recommended &s;trongly to take care of that place; in one of his letters dated the 8th of July, he complains to the King of the want of arms, and blames him again for his clemency.</P>
<P>&startq;Upon the death of a captain of dragoons, in Sir&mdash;Oneile's regiment, twenty-five dragoons of his company de&s;erted with their hor&s;es, and tho&s;e who remained, refu&s;ed to &s;erve, alledging, that they were not engaged but to their captain, they were forced to ca&s;t lots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 17.</NOTE> and one of them was &s;hot; but the regiment was obliged to borrow arms for that purpo&s;e from the lord Mayre's regiment.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;ee, Sire, the condition your troops are in. I leave your Maje&s;ty to judge, if an hone&s;t man, who has a high &s;en&s;e of honour, can continue to command them without great anxiety, when your enemies are particularly attentive to furni&s;h your rebellious &s;ubjects with excellent arms. I doubt not but we &s;hall &s;ee them march again&s;t us &s;oon, with protections in their pockets and arms in their hands, which happened frequently al|ready and happens every day.&endq;</P>
<P>The mare&s;chal de Ro&s;en appears to have been a diligent and active officer; but tho&s;e who &s;erved under him were unacquainted with di&s;cipline, and either James him&s;elf was inattentive to the &s;ervice, or his orders were never properly executed. On the 10th of July,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> de Ro&s;en writes to him from the camp before Derry, that he had received a convoy of 80 waggons, five of them were loaded with &s;words without belts, and the &s;oldiers would be obliged to carry them con&s;tantly in their hands; the other waggons were loaded with powder, ball, &amp;c. and 20,000 <HI>l.</HI> in &s;ilver; this convoy was &s;ent from Dublin to London|derry, e&s;corted only by a quarter ma&s;ter and 12 troopers, and they lay three nights in &s;ight of Inni&s;killing.</P>

<P>That he had left lord Dundee in a retreat, at a place called Bog of Geith, in a &s;trong Country of the North, with &s;ix thou&s;and infantry and two hundred cavalry. That he had had a &s;mall rencounter with Mackay, in which he received a check, being him&s;elf &s;lightly wounded. That Mackay was &s;till not far from him, with three thou&s;and infantry.

<P>That Blantyre's and Glencairn's regiments of infantry and my lord Eglington's regiment of cavalry, with a regiment of dragoons, had gone from Dumbarton to the &s;hire of Argyle; Burgenny's regiment of infantry remaining at Gla&s;gow.</P>
<P>That there were two regiments on board the fleet; Kirke's and, as he believed, Cuningham's, commanded now by Stuart.

<P>That of the two thou&s;and men expected from England, there were two regiments of $avalry. That Schomberg was to have the chief command.

<P>That the Henrietta yacht had &s;ailed from the lake, eight days before, and was to keep at &s;ea until &s;he di&s;covered the Engli&s;h fleet. So that the return of the yacht to the lake will be a &s;ure &s;ign of the arrival of the fleet.</P>

<P>Derry, 15th July.&mdash;General Hamilton gives the earl of Melfort an account, &startq;That a Whitehaven man had two of the prince of Orange's packets on board, directed, as he was informed, to Kirke: that colonel Maxwell had writ to him of a great power em|barked at Liverpool and Che&s;ter.&endq;</P>

<P>July 17th.&mdash;Hamilton wrote to the King, &startq;That the whole fleet, which was thought to have been failed towards Scotland or England, was at anchor beyond Inni&s;haven point: that the duke of Berwick having had notice, that about four hundred of the enemy were at Ramullin, was de&s;igned to march thither, in the beginning of the night, and to fall on them by break of day; his grace's camp being then within ten miles of Ramullin: that twenty of Clancarty's men, and the major, had attempted to lodge them&s;elves in a hou&s;e, within twenty yards of our advance; but in vain, the major having been wounded in the arm, and about twelve of the &s;oldiers killed or wounded.&endq;</P>
<P>James, by this time, had particular intelligence of the preparations made in England for a de&s;cent in &s;ome part of Ireland.

<P>&startq;The chevalier de Carny is of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol.

Signed, Charles Carny.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My opinion is, &s;ince our army is reduced by &s;ickne&s;s and fatigues and de&s;ertion, not to the number of three thou&s;and men able for &s;ervice; judge that number's not in a condition to force the town in a certain time; but believe, that the&s;e of the town are far inferior to our number. Signed by John Wauchop.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;By what I have ob&s;erved, &s;ince the trenches were opened, I am of opinion it will be impo&s;&s;ible for us, in the condition we are in, to force the town that way; and that the nece&s;&s;ities of the be&s;ieged will &s;ooner reduce them than we can, by beginning another attack. Signed by Dom. Sheldon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My opinion is, that we cannot force the town &s;peedily, by rea&s;on of the want of cannon; and that the infantry is fallen very weak, by &s;ickne&s;s and de&s;ertion; but to keep the blockade as long as his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice will permit. Signed, Tho. Buchan.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My opinion, on the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, is, that, con&s;idering the forces which are before Derry, and tho&s;e which are in the place, it is impo&s;&s;ible to take it by force at all; much le&s;s to take it in a limited time. It might be reduced by famine, if we had time and a &s;ufficient number of troops to hinder the &s;hips from throwing in pro|vi&s;ions; and at the &s;ame time to hinder, by a body of troops on the river Fin, the junction of the forces which Kirke hath landed in the i&s;le of Inch, with tho&s;e who have joined the rebels of Inni&s;killin, to whom it will be nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e a body of troops at Trelick; and all the&s;e projects will be ineffectual, if care is not taken that provi&s;ions &s;hall not fail. Signed, Girardin.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is my opinion, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to take the town of Derry by &s;torm, with the little number of foot that is here, or without a con&s;iderable number of battering guns, much le&s;s to gue&s;s when it &s;hall be taken: and I do certainly believe, that unle&s;s they want provi&s;ions, they will never &s;urrender. Berwick.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As I have not changed the opinion of which I have always been, it is not nece&s;&s;ary now to commit it to writing. The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential thing to be done is, to hinder the junction of the Inni&s;killiners with the troops from the &s;hips which are in the i&s;le of Inch and at Ramullin; where they a&s;&s;emble as many as they can of the country people. Their fleet, which left Loch Foyle, being now between Ramullin and Inch, the corps which the duke of Berwick commands for that purpo&s;e, cannot be more advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted than towards Ca&s;tle Fin, where he may have the be&s;t information of the motions of the enemy$ and take the mo&s;t proper mea&s;ures to oppo&s;e them. Care &s;hould be taken that the troops &s;hall not want provi&s;ions, a thing that is mo&s;t to be dreaded, and the danger of aban|doning Belturbat entirely, in ca&s;e (Anthony) Hamilton's corps advances towards Trelick, mu&s;t be con&s;idered.

<P>The 25th, the duke of Berwick was to march towards the inniskillin

Derry was certainly &s;tarving, and the mo&s;t part of the inhabitants

29th, the wind became fair for the &s;hips; whereof two ventured up to
the chain, broke through it, and &s;uccoured the town with provi&s;ions,
which put an end to all hopes of taking it any more by famine<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The 30th of July, major general Buchan writes: &startq;There are two &s;hips got into the town; the &s;malle&s;t of which is loaden with meal from Scotland; the bigger, with bi&s;cuit, chee&s;e, pork, and pea&s;e. The captain of the fir&s;t that came was &s;hot dead, his lieutenant wounded, and five of his men killed, and &s;everal wounded. I think I can do the King more &s;ervice in Scotland than here.&endq;</NOTE>. So,
con&s;idering the threatened inva&s;ion from England, the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;t|ing
and recruiting the troops, and drawing a con&s;iderable body near
Dublin, for the &s;ecurity of his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, from that day forth,
the re&s;olution of rai&s;ing the blockade was fully determined, and all pre|parations
made for the &s;ame; the cannon, ammunition, and the &s;ick &s;ent
away; parties &s;ent to de&s;troy the country, and officers to recruit their
regiments. And whil&s;t all this was doing at Derry, my lord Mount|Ca&s;hell,
who had been &s;ent down to Inni&s;killin the 20th, having a&s;&s;embled
his troops at Belturbat, to the number of 3600 men, the 27th; the
30th he made an attempt upon Crumm-ca&s;tle. The party commanded,
did immediately po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the fir&s;t intrenchments; but the
&s;oldiers, contrary to the general's expre&s;s commands not to go farther,
were &s;o animated with their fir&s;t good &s;ucce&s;s, that they went impru|dently
on to the very ca&s;tle walls, and expo&s;ed them&s;elves; &s;o that
&s;everals were killed, and a great many wounded. Mount-Ca&s;hell, hear|ing
that there were 4000 men come out of Inni&s;killin, of de&s;ign to
relieve Crumm, retired him&s;elf to Newton, two miles from thence, to
put him&s;elf in a condition, either to receive the enemy, if they came,
or to renew, vigorou&s;ly, the attack of the ca&s;tle. But the morrow after,
being the 31&s;t of July, as O'Brian's regiment of dragoons was marching
in the morning to Li&s;ne&s;keny, they di&s;covered a party of the enemy,
<PB N="221" REF="233">
who immediately retired, as &s;oon as they were pu&s;hed, till they came
to a place where two foot companies and five troops of hor&s;e were drawn
up, which put the dragoons into &s;uch a con&s;ternation, that, notwith|&s;tanding
all major general Hamilton could &s;ay or do, to give them good
example, they all ran away mo&s;t ba&s;ely: lord Mount-Ca&s;hell marching up
with the hor&s;e put a &s;top to the pur&s;uit. This, with the report that the
whole force of the rebels were coming to fall upon Mount-Ca&s;hell, obliged
him to retire towards Belturbat to be upon his guard; but he was pre|vented
by the rebels, who following the good fortune they had in the
morning, came up to him at Newton, where he did all a brave man
could do, but was &s;o ill &s;econded by the &s;oldiers, all wearied and di&s;|couraged
by the morning's defeat, and even by mo&s;t of the officers, who
fled with the hor&s;e and dragoons, without &s;o much as waiting the fir&s;t
fire, that the whole army was routed, and &s;ome of the officers that did
their duty killed, among whom was the Sir Stephen Martin; others wound|ed,
among&s;t whom was the lord Abercorn; and others very narrowly
e&s;caped with the lo&s;s of their hor&s;es and all their baggage; among&s;t
whom were as volunteers my lord Drummond and Mr. Ployden, who be|haved
them&s;elves mo&s;t bravely; and my lord Mount-Ca&s;hell him&s;elf, who
was wounded and taken pri&s;oner, for&s;aken by all his regiment, which
was with the mo&s;t part of the foot cut off while they were flying.</P>
<P>A council of war was held to judge of the officers and others behaviour
in this engagement and puni&s;h &s;uch as mi&s;carried. In the mean time, his
Maje&s;ty was giving out commi&s;&s;ions for levying of new forces, and
making all preparations for the defence of the kingdom in ca&s;e of in|va&s;ion.
A camp is ordered and actually begun hard by Dublin; all the
general officers are arrived from Derry; di&s;&s;affected per&s;ons are &s;eized
every where up and down the country, and nothing is neglected for the
&s;ecurity of his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and the defence of this kingdom again&s;t the

He apprehends that this journal is not much, if at all known, as he has not met with it in any printed collection what&s;oever.</P>
<Q>&startq;A journal of the mo&s;t remarkable occurrences that happened between his Maje&s;ty's army, and the forces under the command of Mare&s;chal de Schomberg, in Ireland, from the 12th of Augu&s;t to the 23d of October 1689. Faithfully collected, by James Nihell, E&s;q; under|&s;ecretary to the right honourable the earl of Melfort, his Maje&s;ty's prime &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</Q>
<P>On the 12th of Augu&s;t, 1689, a numerous fleet appeared off the coa&s;t of Donaghadie, in the county of Downe; out of which 200 men made, that night, a de&s;cent on the land, and entrenched them&s;elves.</P>
<P>On the 13th, Mare&s;chal de Schomberg, who commanded the forces on board, de|barking his men, hor&s;es, and train of artillery, &s;et foot on &s;hore without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>On the 14th, he ordered the 200 men that fir&s;t landed, to march to Belfa&s;t; and the next day he followed in per&s;on with the gro&s;s of the army, and refre&s;hed him&s;elf there till the 19th.</P>
<P>On the 19th, he inve&s;ts Carrigfergus; and having &s;ummoned the garri&s;on to &s;urren|der in vain, though with offers of fair and honourable conditions, he drew out his lines, and the next day, played upon the town with four batteries of cannon and three mortar|pieces, be&s;ides all the guns of the navy, to which the place &s;tood expo&s;ed, within di&s;|tance, while he made his approaches by land, where he found the works or walls mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible. Yet, though he with bombs (of which he threw a thou&s;and) had laid all the buildings in a&s;hes; and, though the garri&s;on could not rea&s;onably hope for any &s;uccour, they kept it nine days, and were even then reduced to one barrel of powder, made &s;oldier-like terms, marching out with their arms, colours flying, ball in mouth, and other ceremonies of war, to be attended by convoy, until they were within three miles of the Newry. Yet the articles (though &s;igned by Schomberg him&s;elf) were neverthele&s;s bar|barou&s;ly violated by the &s;oldiers; who, without regard to age, &s;ex, or quality, di&s;armed and &s;tript the towns people, forcing even women to run the gauntlet &s;tark naked.</P>
<P>On the 26th of Augu&s;t, the King came from Dublin to Tredath, attended with 200 of his guards and gentlemen volunteers on hor&s;eback, and found there no more than &s;even regiments of foot and &s;ome few troops of hor&s;e, a &s;trong party of the cavalry being com|manded out as far as the Newry, under the duke of Berwick.</P>
<P>The 6th of September, his Grace, to hinder the enemy's advancement upon him and render his march to the Newry incommodious and difficult, broke up all the cau&s;eways and other defiles through which he mu&s;t pa&s;s; and to make all &s;ecure, burnt even the town, and retired to Dundalk, where he found Mon&s;ieur d'E&s;co, with two companies of foot and a troop of hor&s;e &s;ent out from the army to bring up his rear; for their forces united were very in&s;ufficient to make head again&s;t the enemy, who then pre&s;&s;ed their march. So they all faced about and drew off together.</P>
<P>The King, now in Tredath, was informed, by &s;ome Iri&s;h and one French de&s;erter, that Schomberg's troops were very much di&s;ea&s;ed and already in want of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The 13th, all his Maje&s;ty's forces were come down to the camp near Tredath.</P>
<P>On the 14th, the King marched the army from Tredath to Athardie, about eight Iri&s;h miles, and there met with intelligence, that about twelve &s;ail of the enemy's fleet were the day before up with the Skerries and fired many guns, which drew the militia and &s;uch numbers down to the &s;hore, that they dur&s;t not venture upon it, but bore away large to the &s;outhward, where they ply'd too and again, betwixt Hoath and Bullock, with a de|&s;ign, as it is thought, to animate the malignant party (if any &s;uch were in Dublin) to ri&s;e. But matters were &s;o well &s;ecured there, by the conduct and vigilance of colonel Symon Lutterell, the governor, that, di&s;appointed of all expectations, they vainly &s;tood off to &s;ea and were &s;oon out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>On the 16th, his Maje&s;ty, on the fir&s;t appearance of day, marched the hor&s;e and dra|goons from Athardie to Allard&s;ton, near A&s;&s;yn-Bridge, about three miles &s;hort of Dundalk, of which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf about twelve. By midnight following, his foot guards came up to him; and the body of infantry by noon next day. Having fortified the bridge, he placed the guards on the further &s;ide of the river, and &s;ent parties out to di&s;cover the enemy. Towards the evening &s;ix troops of the cavalry made up to a &s;mall advanced party of 50 hor&s;e and &s;ome few volunteers that attended his Maje&s;ty's army, who, never|thele&s;s, receiving the enemy's fire, immediately charged and put them to &s;light.</P>
<P>On the 18th, the whole camp was formed with as much regularity and advantage a$ the ground would admit of. The King, in his per&s;on, having traver&s;ed it all over after viewing the entrenchments and po&s;ture of the enemy.</P>
<P>On the 19th, &s;everal per&s;ons were taken, and &s;ome de&s;erters $ame with intelligence, that Schomberg had &s;et all hands to work to &s;ecure him&s;elf, by fortifying Dundalk, and &s;eemed rather to prepare again&s;t a &s;iege than a battle.</P>
<P>On the 20th, the King drew out his army; and, marching in the head of the fir&s;t and &s;econd line within le&s;s than cannon-&s;hot of the enemy, he immediately put them in order of battle (according to a method agreed on) with wonderful expedition and &s;ilence. The lines extended them&s;elves from South-ea&s;t to North-we&s;t, along a ridge of hillocks that front the town. The &s;econd line &s;hewed it&s;elf between the intervals of the fir&s;t. In this po&s;ture, they &s;tood for three hours. The &s;oldiers, tran&s;ported with courage by the pre&s;ence and great example of their King at the head of them, could not forbear, by &s;houting and other demon&s;trations of joy, to dare and challenge the invaders; who, ne|verthele&s;s, could not be provoked nor invited by any means out of their fortifications: and, therefore, the King, di&s;appointed in his hopes of deciding the war by a battle, com|manded his troops, ju&s;t under the Mare&s;chal's view, to march ea&s;ily back to their camp again: His Maje&s;ty him&s;elf remaining in the rear of all his army, until he &s;aw the la&s;t &s;oldier drawn off. Seven pri&s;oners were that night brought in by a detached party of dragoons from a village called Haggard&s;toun, on the &s;ea-&s;ide. The captains O'Neal and Murphy likewi&s;e with 50 foot &s;urprizing a party of 80 dragoons behind a mountain that covered the enemy, killed two on the place (among whom &s;ome French Hugonots re|fu&s;ed quarter), took &s;ix pri&s;oners, the re&s;t e&s;caping by flight.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, the King gave orders for the fortifying Athardie with ditches, ramparts, and other nece&s;&s;ary works. A retrenchment was likewi&s;e ca&s;t up before the left wing of the fir&s;t line.</P>
<P>On the 24th, the King viewed the country on all &s;ides, re&s;olving, when he found it nece&s;&s;ary or convenient to di&s;lodge from the ground he then &s;tood incamped on, and to pitch his tents on the edges of &s;mall hillocks that ari&s;e between the rivers of Mapa&s;toun and Athardie, and therefore gave general orders for pre&s;erving the forrage in all parts within command of his army. [The&s;e are the operations of the 29th day in the manu|&s;crpt of the journal.]</P>
<P>On the 26th, a commanded party of hor&s;e dragoons with 35 companies of grenadeers, &s;et fire to all the forrage and corn on the other &s;ide of the Lurgan river, for three miles along the &s;ea coa&s;t, and under the enemy's no&s;e, who, neverthele&s;s, made a faint fally, but were ea&s;ily forced back to their trenches again.</P>
<P>On the 28th, towards the evening, the di&s;charge of the enemy's artillery three times, pur&s;ued with as many vollies of &s;mall &s;hot and huzzas, amu&s;ed the King's camp for &s;ome while, until di&s;abu&s;ed next day by a de&s;erter, who &s;aid, all that noi&s;e was the celebration of a great victory obtained by tho&s;e of Inni&s;killin again&s;t the King's party at Sligo; but this mighty action, upon better intelligence, proved only a &s;kirmi&s;h between a &s;mall band of that county militia and a troop of rebels, wherein three of the loyali&s;ts fell, and that number twice told of the enemy.</P>
<P>On the 30th, an en&s;ign from Mac Carty More's regiment returned to his Maje&s;ty's camp with advice, that 3 &s;hips, wherein were embarked colonel Villiers' troop of hor&s;e and men, were newly ca&s;t away: that 500 French officers and &s;oldiers, &s;u&s;pected to be Catholicks and well-wi&s;hers to his Maje&s;ty's cau&s;e, were &s;ent a &s;hip-board, their place of confinement: that &s;even Frenchmen and a captain were hanged upon &s;u&s;picion of affect|ing the King's party: that four&s;core a day at the lea&s;t were &s;ent from the enemy's camp to the ho&s;pital; and that all their hor&s;es were turned out to gra&s;s for want of hay and other nece&s;&s;ary forrage.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t, two regiments of foot were commanded to Sligo, and the parts on all &s;ides adjacent to it, to pre&s;erve the inhabitants under his Maje&s;ty's obedience, and check the excur&s;ions from Inni&s;killin.</P>
<P>On the 2d of October, a party of 150 foot were detached, under the command of lieu|tenant colonel Stapylton and captain Hugh Macnamara, to relieve and bring off the 500 French that Schomberg had cau&s;ed to be &s;tript and carried by water to Carlingford, &s;u&s;pecting they had a de&s;ign of changing their party. The march was difficult and ha|zardous, for they could not avoid the Engli&s;h camp but by a detour of at lea&s;t 30 miles, and that through almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able mountains; neverthele&s;s they marched cheerfully over them to a vale within &s;ix miles of Carlingford, where making a halt, to fix their arms and cover their priming again&s;t a &s;hower of rain that hung over their heads, a party of the enemy came upon them; and being demanded, whom they were for, they an&s;wered, they were for King William; &s;o are we, &s;aid Stapylton, with purpo&s;e of taking his opportu|nity of &s;urpri&s;ing them: but the zealous &s;oldiers, ignorant of his meaning, declared loudly, they were for King James, and made good their words with a volley. Fourteen they killed on the &s;pot, &s;eized all their arms, and made eight pri&s;oners, without receiv|ing a wound. [<HI>The MS. copy of the Journal concludes here.</HI>]</P>
<P>On the 5th of October, forage becoming now &s;carce, the King thought &s;it to return to Athardie; and on the 6th, very betimes in the morning, the army was in a readine&s;s to march. But the &s;moke of the &s;oldiers huts, &s;et on fire by command, made their fir&s;t &s;et|ting out a little incommodious and difficult, but that was &s;oon over, for when they &s;aw clear, they ea&s;ily fell into their ranks and marched in great order; the right wing of the hor&s;e and dragoons, with two brigades of foot, the cannon, and all the King's equipage, by Mapa&s;toun Bridge; the left wing, with the re&s;erve of the foot, and all the baggage of the army, by the road that led to the Bridge of Tallan&s;town; and that afternoon the foot encamped in two lines near Athardie, having the river and a long mora&s;s before them. The hor&s;e and dragoons, for convenience of &s;orrage, and &s;helter, were &s;ent to three vil|lages lying on the right of the infantry; and the brigade of foot, that made the <HI>corps de re&s;erve,</HI> to another village beyond them. But the next day, his Maje&s;ty vi&s;iting that part of the army, thought the <HI>corps de re&s;erve</HI> (as indeed it was) too far advanced, and there|fore gave orders that they &s;hould return to the village where the duke of Tyrconnel's regiment lay; and &s;ent the lord Dongan's dragoons, with three other battalions of foot from the camp, to reinforce that po&s;t. He then ordered a brea&s;twork to be made at the end of a narrow cau&s;eway that pa&s;&s;es through the bog, and a guard of 60 foot to defend it. Colonel Purcell's and Sir James Cotter's dragoons were po&s;ted on the left at Dowd&s;toun and Peppard&s;toun, to &s;ecure the two bridges. The earl of Abercorn's regiment of hor&s;e &s;tood encamped at a &s;mall village between the two lines. But the hor&s;es of that and colonel John Parker's regiment being very much hara&s;&s;ed, and no danger appearing from the enemy, his Maje&s;ty thought fit to &s;end them to their winter quarters.</P>
<P>The King having rea&s;on to believe that mare&s;chal Schomberg would not ea&s;ily quit Dun|dalk, called a council of war, and propo&s;ed the fortifying of Athardie, to hinder his ad|vance, and to facilitate the carrying on of the war earlier in the &s;pring. Some of the chief officers were of opinion again&s;t it; yet the duke of Tyrconnel, who chiefly &s;econded the King's re&s;olution of marching from Tredath with his army, in order to engage the enemy, to which (under God) we owe all the &s;ucce&s;s we have met with, joining in opi|nion with his Maje&s;ty, the work was &s;et on foot, and that place made &s;o &s;trong a frontier before the King left it, that though Schomberg &s;tayed for almo&s;t ten days after at Dun|dalk, where he lo&s;t by di&s;temper above 10,000 men, yet made no attempt upon the party left at Athardie under the command of major general Boi&s;elot, but was glad to make a &s;afe retreat with the &s;urviving part of his army, leaving many &s;ick behind, and a number of dead bodies unburied.</P></NOTE>.</P>

and other rea&s;ons determined the King to hazard a battle, and &s;o pre|pared
for it the be&s;t he could; though the ford at Old-bridge was not
to be maintained.</P>
<P>June 30th. The enemy appeared on the other &s;ide the river, over-again&s;t
the King's army, where the river was fordable almo&s;t every where. The
King made &s;ome of his cannon advance; which &s;o galled the right wing,
that they retired out of &s;ight, behind the eminence. It was there the
prince of Orange was touched, on the &s;houlder, by one of the fir&s;t two
&s;hots, which fetched off the &s;kin, but did no further prejudice.</P>
<P>July 1&s;t. The enemy were heard to beat the generale before day. As
&s;oon as the &s;un was up, their right wing marched toward Stane. The
King ordered his left to march likewi&s;e; and &s;ent off his baggage toward
Dublin, with all the cannon but &s;ix. Sir Neal O'Neal's dragoons did
their part well. They di&s;puted the pa&s;&s;age almo&s;t an hour, till their
cannon came up; and then retired in good order. The enemy pa&s;&s;ed.
They &s;tretched their line to the right, as if they de&s;igned to take the
flank, or to get between us and Dublin, which M. de Lau&s;un &s;eeing,
marched with the left to keep up with them, and ob&s;erve their motions.
The King went to the right, to ha&s;ten up the troops to follow de Lau|&s;un,
<PB N="227" REF="241">
believing the main body of the enemy was following their right,
which had pa&s;&s;ed the Boyne at Stane. He found the duke of Tyrcon|nel,
with the hor&s;e and dragoons of the right and the two fir&s;t brigades
of the fir&s;t line, drawn up before Old-bridge; from which po&s;t he did not
think fit to draw them, the cannon and baggage being not far enough
advanced on their way to Dublin. The red of the foot, however,
marched, by their flank, after de Lau&s;un. The King him&s;elf took the
re&s;erve, con&s;i&s;ting of Purcell and Brown's foot, with which he marched
till he came up with the rear of the foot, that followed de Lau&s;un. He
found de Lau&s;un and the enemy's right drawn up in battle order within
half cannon &s;hot, facing each other. The King did not think fit to
charge ju&s;t then, being in expectation of the troops he left at Old-bridge.
But while he was di&s;cour&s;ing this matter with de Lau&s;un, an aid-de-camp
came to give the King an account that the enemy had forced the pa&s;s at
Old-bridge, and that the right wing was beaten. The King, whi&s;pering
in Lau&s;un's ear, told him, there was now nothing to be done, but to
charge the enemy, forthwith, before his troops knew what had happened
on the right, and, by that means, to try if they could recover the day.
He placed M. Haguette at the head of the French foot. He ordered
the dragoons to light, and placed them in the intervals between, and or|dered
Lau&s;un to lead on. But as they were beginning to move, Sar&s;e|field
and Maxwell, who had been to view the ground between the two
armies, &s;aid, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the hor&s;e to charge the enemy by rea|&s;on
of two double ditches with high banks, and a little brook betwixt
them, that run along the &s;mall valley which divided the armies, and at
the &s;ame time, the enemy's dragoons got a hor&s;e-back, and their whole
line began to march, by their flank, to the right, and we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight
of their van, by a village that interpo&s;ed; only by a du&s;t that ro&s;e be|hind
it, they &s;eemed to endeavour to gain the Dublin road; upon which
the King thought fit to march al&s;o by the left to the Dublin road too, to
pa&s;s the &s;mall brook at Duleek which was impracticable higher above,
by rea&s;on of a bog. The King was no &s;ooner on his march, but the
right wing's being beat was no longer a my&s;tery; for &s;everal of the &s;cat|tered
and wounded hor&s;emen got in among&s;t them, before they reached
Duleek. Whereupon M. de Lau&s;un advi&s;ed the King, to take his own

and to make the be&s;t of his way to Dublin; for fear the enemy, who
were &s;o &s;trong in hor&s;e and dragoons, &s;hould make detachments and get
thither before him, which he was confident they would endeavour to do.
But that, if his Maje&s;ty arrived there fir&s;t, he might, with the troops he
had with him and the garri&s;on he found there, prevent their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
them&s;elves of the town, till M. Lau&s;un could make the retreat, which
he prayed him to leave to his conduct; and advi&s;ed him not to remain
in Dublin neither; but to go with all expedition for France, to prevent
his falling into the enemy's hands; which would be not only his, but
the prince his &s;on's utter ruin. That as long as there was life, there was
hope; and that if he was once in France again, his cau&s;e was not &s;o
de&s;perate, they being in all probability ma&s;ters at &s;ea. That he would
give one of his hands that he could have the honour to accompany him.
But he mu&s;t make his retreat in the be&s;t manner he could; or die with
the French, if they were beaten. The King demurred. But he at length
yielded to de Lau&s;un's advice. The whole army of the Engli&s;h had now
pa&s;&s;ed the river. Tho&s;e who were not beaten were forced to retreat;
and, by con&s;equence, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to do &s;o too.</P>
<P>The &s;even battalions of foot behind the eminence advanced again&s;t
the enemy at Old-bridge to within a pike's length of the Engli&s;h. But
upon being &s;lanked by the enemy's hor&s;e, they fled. Duke of Berwick
wounded, and left among the enemy. He got off by the help of a
trooper. Schomberg &s;aid to have been killed, by an exempt of the
guards, Sir Charles Take or O'Tool. It was a great over-fight in the
enemy, their army being &s;o numerous, that, &s;o &s;oon as they had beat
the right wing of the King's army at Old-bridge, they did not march
after them; for had they done &s;o, they might have got to Duleek be|fore
the King, who was with the left, and &s;o have cut off his retreat to
Dublin, and routed the whole army. But the King had no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed
the de&s;ile with the van of his left, and was marching towards Dublin, but
Tyrconnel joined Lau&s;un, as he was pa&s;&s;ing; at which time the enemy
appeared and offered to attack their rear. But they turned upon them,
with &s;ome hor&s;e and the French foot, and made &s;o good a countenance,
that they &s;uffered them to pa&s;s quietly over the brook, and bring five
of the &s;ix pieces of cannon which attended the left wing; the other
being bogged was lo&s;t. From whence they made their retreat to the
<PB N="229" REF="243">
Neale, another great de&s;ile, in good order; the enemy waiting &s;till on
them, without pre&s;&s;ing them. When night came, they followed no more,
However, that panic fear, which had &s;eized the Iri&s;h, pur&s;ued them
&s;till; for as &s;oon as it began to be dark, the greate&s;t part of the troops
di&s;per&s;ed, many of them having thrown down their arms and de&s;erted
before. But the French retired in good order.</P>
<P>The King having yielded to M. de Lau&s;un's advice, got to Dublin
that night, where he met with major Wil&s;on with letters from the queen,
and an account of the prince of Waldeck's being entirely routed at Fle|rus.
This good news encouraged his de&s;ign of going for France. But
before he would re&s;olve upon it, he &s;poke &s;ingly with tho&s;e of his privy
council he tru&s;ted mo&s;t; as the two chancellors, the duke of Powis,
&s;ecretary Neagle, marquis of Albeville, the lord chief baron, and others,
who were unanimous in their opinion, he &s;hould lo&s;e no time. They
believed the enemy would be at Dublin next morning. About midnight
the duke of Berwick &s;ent an aid-de-camp to acquaint the King, that he
had rallied about 7000 foot at Bra&s;&s;il, and de&s;ired him to &s;end &s;ome
hor&s;e and dragoons. They, however, di&s;per&s;ed before day-light. The
duke of Tyrconnel &s;ent his chaplain to reque&s;t the King to leave Dub|lin,
and &s;ail for France. The King ordered Simon Luttrel to march to
Le&s;lip, with all the forces in town, except two troops of the King's own
regiment of hor&s;e, which he kept to attend him, to join M. de Lau&s;un.
He re&s;olved to go to France, to do &s;omething there more effectual, than
he could do with &s;uch a di&s;heartened body of men as he had in Ireland.
The French general officers, when he was mounting his hor&s;e, arrived from
M. de Lau&s;un. They reque&s;ted him to be gone. They told him, that
even the French troops were di&s;per&s;ed to find provi&s;ions. That nothing
could be done. That the enemy were fa&s;t approaching to Dublin. The
King &s;et out about five in the morning; he went lei&s;urely to Bray, ten
miles from Dublin. He left there his two troops of hor&s;e, till twelve
o'clock, to defend the bridge, as long as they could, &s;hould any party
of the enemy pur&s;ue. He took his journey through the hills of Wick|low,
and from them pur&s;ued his way to Duncannon. Having baited
his hor&s;es, at Mr. Hacket's hou&s;e near Areto, he was overtaken as he
left it by the French general officers, who reque&s;ted him to make more
ha&s;te, as they a&s;&s;ured him, otherwi&s;e, that the enemy would overtake
<PB N="230" REF="244">
him. The King &s;aid he could not believe that any of the enemy had
&s;o far advanced. They were po&s;itive, and the King mended his pace.
He left la Rue and a brigadier of the guards at a bridge, when it grew
dark, in order to &s;top the enemy in ca&s;e they advanced. They &s;taid
half an hour. They heard of no enemy. The King travelled all night,
and arrived at Duncannon at &s;un-ri&s;e. They found there the Lau&s;un,
a Malouin of 23 guns, newly come with goods for Ireland. They pre|vailed
with the captain to get under &s;ail, and to fall down with the tide.
He went round in her to Kin&s;ale; where he found M. Forar a chef
d'E&s;cadre, with a &s;quadron of &s;even &s;mall French &s;hips, laden with corn
and wine, together with M. du Que&s;ne with three frigates.</P>

<HEAD>Tran&s;lation.</HEAD>
<OPENER>St. Germains, <DATE>20th July, 1690.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;It is with great plea&s;ure I learnt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. A&s;tle's Papers.</NOTE> from the major general of the fleet, all the parti|culars of your late &s;ea engagement. I waited for the end of it, in order to expre&s;s to you my joy compleatly, and to join my rejoicings with your own, which I do very hear|tily; a&s;&s;uring you at the &s;ame time, that the glory you derive from this great &s;ucce&s;s, gives me a very particular plea&s;ure, which you would have no difficulty in believing, if you was as thoroughly per&s;uaded of my e&s;teem and friend&s;hip as you have rea&s;on to be. For a long time before, I did not know what joy was; but I own, that this victory has given me a great deal, on account of the intere&s;ts of your ma&s;ter, as well as of my own. After what you have lately done, I con&s;ider the King as ma&s;ter of the &s;ea, and in a con|dition to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the king my hu&s;band in his kingdoms, and to free him&s;elf thereby, from a great part of his enemies. If we are lucky enough to return &s;oon to our own country, I &s;hall always con&s;ider that you was the fir&s;t to open the way to it, for it was effectually &s;hut again&s;t us, before the &s;ucce&s;s of this engagement, to which your good conduct has contributed &s;o much. But, if I do not deceive my&s;elf, it appears to me now to be compleatly open, providing the King could gain &s;ome little time in Ireland, which I hope he will. Yet I tremble with fear, left the prince of Orange, who fees clearly that it is his intere&s;t to hinder him, &s;hould pu&s;h the King, and oblige him to give battle. But whatever may happen in that re&s;pect, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for you to have large ve&s;&s;els, as well as frigates, in St. George's Channel. The King is &s;o thoroughly per|&s;uaded of this, that he was plea&s;ed to tell me, the other day, that he had already given orders, that, as &s;oon as the &s;hips could be repaired after the fight, a &s;quadron of them &s;hould be &s;ent to the channel. This being the ca&s;e, I cannot hinder my&s;elf from entreat|ing you earne&s;tly, to ha&s;ten, as much as you can, the execution of this order; otherwi&s;e, neither Ireland nor the per&s;on of the King, my hu&s;band, can be &s;afe.</P>
<P>&startq;We &s;ee, by letters from England, that that wretched country is in the greate&s;t con|&s;ternation. Time &s;hould not be given them to re&s;ume courage; and I am per&s;uaded, that, if the king was now among them, he would prevail. But I hope that will be the ca&s;e very &s;oon: for his Maje&s;ty is full of goodne&s;s towards us, and appears to me to have a great de&s;ire to render us happy. I think he will &s;ucceed. For it is an action worthy of him; and I am per&s;uaded, that God de&s;tines the glory of it for him. Next to him, you have the greate&s;t &s;hare of it; and I &s;hall be happy to owe to you, rather than to any other, &s;uch an obligation, as I &s;hall never forget, and as will induce me always to look for methods of te&s;tifying to you my gratitude.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MARIA, R.&endq;</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></NOTE>. She had &s;o great an intere&s;t with M. Seignelay, the French
<PB N="231" REF="245">
mini&s;ter for the marine, that he became extremely zealous for the King's
&s;ervice. It was he that procured the &s;itting out of a fleet able to di&s;pute
the dominion of the &s;eas. This &s;mall &s;quadron came opportunely for
the King's &s;afety. Had the King been able to have waved that deci&s;ive
&s;troke at the Boyne a few weeks, he might have &s;een the French fleet
ma&s;ters of St. George's Channel, and in a condition either to have tran&s;|ported
him and his army to England, or of hindering any &s;uccours from
coming to the prince of Orange, which was what M. Seignelay de&s;igned.
But the King's life was a chain of misfortunes and di&s;appointments; &s;o
that what advantages the French got were no ways beneficial to him.
His misfortunes were doubly &s;uch, by le&s;&s;ening his credit and intere&s;t
with his friends as much as it did with his enemies. He wrote to Tyr|connel,
that he was going to France. He &s;aid he hoped to &s;end more
&s;uccours, and, in the mean time, left them 50,000 pi&s;toles; which was
all the money he had. He arrived at Bre&s;t, on the 20th of July, N. S.
He wrote to the Queen. He informed her of his misfortunes. He &s;aid,
he was &s;en&s;ible that he would be blamed for hazarding a battle. But
that he had no other po&s;t &s;o advantageous to defend, unle&s;s he would
abandon all without a &s;troke, and &s;uffer him&s;elf to be at la&s;t driven into
the &s;ea. But as the unfortunate are cen&s;ured always more ways than one,
&s;ome blamed him for hazarding too much, and others for his quitting
Ireland &s;o &s;oon. That coun&s;el was, no doubt, too precipitate; and it is
wonderful, why Tyrconnel pre&s;&s;ed it with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s; unle&s;s it
<PB N="232" REF="246">
was from the &s;olicitations of the Queen, who, in a letter of June 27th
to him, entreated him, in the molt vehement terms, to &s;ave the King's
per&s;on, at any rate. He, however, ought not to have advi&s;ed &s;uch dif|heartening
councils, as to make the King abandon a cau&s;e that had &s;till
&s;o much hopes of life. It did him great detriment. It was not likely
that either his own people or the King of France would eagerly maintain
a cau&s;e, which he him&s;elf had de&s;erted. But it may be &s;aid, al&s;o, that
it was the unanimous advice of the council, the generals, and all per|&s;ons
about him; there was too an univer&s;al panic, as appears from the
circum&s;tance, that even the French officers, men of &s;ervice, &s;aw vi&s;ions
of troops, when none certainly could be within twenty miles. This is
the only excu&s;e for the wrong re&s;olution of the King. He had al&s;o
formed a &s;cheme in his own mind, which he found, upon his arrival,
had been actually laid by the court of France. The French, the King
knew, were ma&s;ters at &s;ea, ever &s;ince the battle of Bantry Bay. They
were al&s;o, &s;ince the victory at Flerus, confe&s;&s;edly ma&s;ters at land. The
King imagined the &s;ooner he got into France, that he would the &s;ooner
convince his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, that the only way to break the
league was, to land him, with a &s;uitable body of troops, in England.
He hoped al&s;o to &s;end a &s;quadron to St. George's Channel to prevent
the prince of Orange's return, and to land &s;ome Iri&s;h troops in Scotland.
This was the chief cau&s;e of his flight. The news of the victory off
Beachy head met him at Bre&s;t; and he applauded him&s;elf exceedingly in
that re&s;olution. The King knew of the de&s;ign of fighting the combined
fleets. He knew, that M. Seignelay de&s;igned at the &s;ame time to &s;end
25 light frigates to St. George's Channel, and to burn all the &s;hips on
both &s;ides, but &s;uch as were nece&s;&s;ary to bring off the King and &s;ome
troops; and, by that means, to have kept the prince of Orange in Ire|land.
All this well-laid &s;cheme he knew; and it was the main induce|ment
to his retreat. But the bu&s;ine&s;s was over before his arrival, as was
&s;aid; and neither he nor the French them&s;elves reaped any advantage.
The &s;ickne&s;s of Seignelay hindered him from going on board as he in|tended;
which forced him to give that commi&s;&s;ion to the chevalier de
Tourville. His negligence in not de&s;troying the combined fleets was
vehemently re&s;ented by Seignelay. Tourville a&s;cribed his want of &s;uc|ce&s;s
to the Engli&s;h having taken up the buoys. Seignelay &s;aid, in a
<PB N="233" REF="247">
pa&s;&s;ion, that it proceeded from his cowardice. Tourville took fire.
Seignelay explained him&s;elf, by &s;aying, that he meant only with regard
to his conduct; for that there were many (of which number he took
him to be) <HI>qui e&s;toient poltrons de te&s;te, quoyqu'ils ne l'e&s;toient point du
coeur.</HI></P>
<P>The day after the King's arrival at St. Germains, the King of France
came to fee him, and promi&s;ed him all imaginable kindne&s;s and &s;up|port.
But when he laid open his project, he received it coldly, and &s;aid,
he could do nothing in it till he heard from Ireland. The King told
him, that there was no occa&s;ion to hear from Ireland, to convince him
that England was naked. But his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty was di&s;&s;atisfied
with the King's late conduct, either of him&s;elf or the in&s;inuations of
his mini&s;ter. He was aver&s;e to another expedition, which might, he
thought, be as ha&s;tily relinqui&s;hed. He pretended an indi&s;po&s;ition, and
would not fee the King, till in fact it was too late to do any thing. When
the King ob&s;erved this cau&s;e of delay, his patience never in his life un|derwent
&s;uch another trial. The defection of his &s;ubjects, the lo&s;s of
the battle, the de&s;ertion of his favourites, had never thrown him into
&s;uch de&s;pair, as this not &s;uffering him to open his heart to the prince,
who was his only friend and &s;upport in the world. But he was de&s;tined
to be, a victim to patience by Providence; which his friends, as well as
his enemies, exerci&s;ed by turns. He even pre&s;&s;ed to be permitted to
go on board the fleet. This was denied, as nothing, they &s;aid could
be done, without land-forces. The threatened junction of the elector
of Brandenburgh with the prince of Waldeck was the excu&s;e. But this
was a poor pretence, when the prince of Orange, with 40,000 men,
could be kept from acting, by the other expedient.</P>
<P>The retreat of the prince of Orange from Limeric was &s;hameful; a
place which &s;carce de&s;erved the name of a fortre&s;s. Tyrconnel came
immediately to France, to &s;olicit &s;uccours. The French and de Lau&s;un,
being wearied of Ireland, wi&s;hed Limeric had been taken. Boi&s;leau,
during the a&s;&s;ault, ordered &s;everal battalions away from the breach. But
he was di&s;obeyed, and the place &s;aved. There were factions between
the French and the Iri&s;h, and between the Iri&s;h and them&s;elves; when
the enemy gave them re&s;pite, their whole bu&s;ine&s;s was to fight among
them&s;elves. A faction was formed again&s;t Tyrconnel, and they pre|pared
<PB N="234" REF="248">
to &s;end per&s;ons, as they afterwards did, to complain of his con|duct.
Tyrconnel took the opportunity of coming away with de Lau&s;un.
The King, in the mean time, repre&s;ented to the court of France, how
great a pity it was, not to &s;upport the &s;ucce&s;sful valour of the Iri&s;h.
The bi&s;hop of Cork, colonel Simon and H. Lutterel, and colonel Nic.
Purcel, came to complain of Tyrconnel to St. Germains. Tyrconnel
endeavoured to cro&s;s-bite them, and to induce the King to &s;eize them,
and keep them in France. The King, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t them, re|fu&s;ed
to &s;ee the deputies.</P>
<P>The earl of Anandale, lord Ro&s;s, and Sir James Montgomery cor|re&s;pond
with the King. As intere&s;t was the prime motive to their re|turn
to their duty, they fir&s;t made terms for them&s;elves. The King
knew it, but he re&s;olved to encourage repentance. He appointed An|nandale
commi&s;&s;ioner, Montgomery &s;ecretary of &s;tate. When the par|liament
met, they pur&s;ued their point with earne&s;tne&s;s. The duke of
Queen&s;berry, marquis of Athol, and earl of Argyle, concurred with
them. But the Pre&s;byterians, whom they formerly governed, began to
abandon the&s;e undertakers. They, di&s;covering that they could not carry
their point, were convinced, that they could change &s;ides more ea&s;ily
than governments. They, therefore, made their peace, by di&s;covering
all they knew; and even &s;uffered the very papers and commi&s;&s;ions, which
came from the King, to fall into Melvin the commi&s;&s;ioner's hands.
They, however, refu&s;ed to be witne&s;&s;es. Buchan was &s;oon after un&s;uc|ce&s;sful
at Cromdale. He was &s;urpri&s;ed in the night. The King's friends
began to li&s;ten to the offers of the prince of Orange, who was extremely
anxious to leave all quiet, before he pa&s;&s;ed into Ireland. He offered
5000<HI>l.</HI> and &s;everal other advantages to the earl of Breadalbin. Bread|albin
went to meet the prince of Orange at Che&s;ter. But he was gone
before he arrived: &s;o nothing was then done. The King's friends &s;oli|cited
then a &s;upply, and propo&s;ed the King's landing in Scotland, rather
than in England. The King &s;ent &s;ome pre&s;ent relief to the Highlanders,
by a &s;hip from Nantes. The Queen had, before his arrival in France,
ordered 5000<HI>l.</HI> to be paid them from England. She had al&s;o ordered
10,000<HI>l.</HI> to follow it.</P>
<P>Mr. de Seignelay, the &s;ecretary for the marine, continued &s;till zealous
for the King. He re&s;olved to go again on board the &s;leet, to &s;ee, in
<PB N="235" REF="249">
per&s;on, his own &s;chemes executed. But cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments
pur&s;ued the King, through all the labyrinths of his life. That able mi|ni&s;ter
&s;oon after died; and his de&s;igns, ju&s;t on the point of being exe|cuted,
fell with his life. Ireland, as well as Scotland, was anxious to
have &s;upplies. The enemy had made attempts to cro&s;s the Shannon.
The duke of Berwick &s;ent out parties, which prevented them; and en|deavoured
to do what he could to mole&s;t them in his turn.</P>

<P>Tyrconnel returned from France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1691.</NOTE> and arrived at Limeric in January,
1691. He found the troops there in a mi&s;erable condition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maepher|&s;on's Ex|tracts.</NOTE> The King's
ta&s;k, with regard to Ireland, was difficult. The court of France was
divided into factions. Lord Mountca&s;hel, who had a great and bene|ficial
command in France, oppo&s;ed Tyrconnel, and ob&s;tructed his mea|&s;ures.
The King ordered Tyrconnel not to u&s;e people roughly, but to
gain them by gentlene&s;s; which he promi&s;ed to do, though he owned
it was not agreeable to his temper. The King was in pain for the duke
of Berwick. He had &s;ent the commi&s;&s;ioners again&s;t Tyrconnel to France,
and he was a kind of ho&s;tage for them. He ordered, therefore, the
duke of Berwick to leave Ireland, upon Tyrconnel's return. Notwith|&s;tanding
the mi&s;eries of the Iri&s;h army, the Engli&s;h de&s;erted to them in
great numbers. Tyrconnel &s;aid, that had he a pi&s;tole a piece to give to
the &s;oldiers, and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence afterwards, he could a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of one
third of the prince of Orange's troops. Mon&s;ieur Louvois, a haughty
and a hardened mini&s;ter, did little in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the King, or in removing
the mi&s;eries of Ireland. He writ to Tyrconnel, that he was &s;urpri&s;ed
at his complaining of the &s;upplies; much more, that he would trouble
him with complaints again&s;t Mountca&s;hel. His &s;on, who &s;ucceeded him,
inherited his father's har&s;h and imperious &s;pirit.</P>
<P>It was now the beginning of May. No news in Ireland of the fleet.
The troops forced to eat hor&s;e-fle&s;h. The king &s;ent them 10,000 pi&s;loles
out of his own &s;canty allowance. He was, in the mean time, pre&s;&s;ed and
teazed by all his friends. They quarrelled among them&s;elves. They
perplexed him with complaints. He gave all that he could; but that
all was but little, and inadequate. The attempts made in England, for
<PB N="236" REF="250">
the King's re&s;toration, prove un&s;ucce&s;sful. His friends, however, in|crea&s;e.
They wi&s;hed to re&s;tore him, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France.
But that was impracticable. They were afraid of a conque&s;t. They
&s;ent, therefore, lord Pre&s;ton, A&s;hton, and Eliot with propo&s;als. They
permitted him to live a catholic in devotion, but to reign as a prote&s;tant
in government: that the utmo&s;t that could be expected for Papi&s;ts, was
a legal liberty of con&s;cience: that the power mu&s;t be placed in the
hands of prote&s;tants, who were two hundred to one: that the King of
France &s;hould engage his word to a&s;&s;i&s;t him only as a friend. They were
taken in a &s;hip, which they hired. They were tried. Pre&s;ton and A&s;h|ton
were condemned.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding this di&s;covery, others were not di&s;couraged from
owning their inclination to return to their duty. To the King's great
&s;urprize, my lord Churchill and my lord Godolphin them&s;elves were of
the number. It was &s;uppo&s;ed, that the intentions of the&s;e men were to
&s;ave them&s;elves, in ca&s;e of a re&s;toration, again&s;t the King's re&s;entment.
The &s;ucce&s;s of France, and the aver&s;ion of the Engli&s;h to the prince of
Orange, made a re&s;toration appear an event not far di&s;tant. Their
&s;eeming repentance, e&s;pecially that of Churchill, had all the appearance
of &s;incerity. Lord Godolphin had, in con&s;equence of a promi&s;e to the
prince of Orange, as he &s;aid, accepted again of an office. When Buck|ley
waited upon him, he inquired kindly concerning the court of St.
Germains, but with a &s;eeming de&s;pondency. Buckley a&s;ked him what
he would do to &s;erve the cau&s;e. He ro&s;e &s;uddenly from his chair, and
&s;aid he would quit his office. This was a coy beginning. Buckley went
to Halifax. He received him with open arms. He promi&s;ed to do
every thing that lay in his power to &s;erve the King. Halifax was ne|ver
to be &s;atisfied, if controuled in any thing. This had alienated him
formerly from the King. The prince of Orange finding his politicks,
though nice and &s;ubtle in &s;peculation, yet &s;eldom good in practice; they
two did not hit it long. This free a&s;&s;urance of Halifax encouraged others.
Godolphin was particularly encouraged, and made open a&s;&s;urances to
the King. He promi&s;ed to re&s;ign. But it went again&s;t his con&s;cience
to betray his tru&s;t from any man. It had been happy, had he been al|ways
&s;o &s;crupulous. Mr. Buckley one day met Godolphin and Churchill
in the Park. They &s;eemed mighty glad to &s;ee him, He invited both
<PB N="237" REF="251">
to dine at his lodgings. They came. They received him &s;o frankly,
and they made &s;uch advances, that he propo&s;ed to try them. But lord
Churchill was &s;o forward in the matter, that he prevented him, by &s;end|ing,
&s;oon after, for colonel Sackville. The colonel waited upon him,
though with reluctancy. He was highly &s;urprized to find Churchill
the greate&s;t penitent imaginable. He begged him to a&s;&s;ure the King of
his &s;incere repentance, and to intercede for mercy; that he was ready to
redeem his apo&s;tacy with the hazard of his utter ruin, his crimes ap|pearing
&s;o horrid to him: that he could neither &s;leep nor eat, in con|tinual
angui&s;h, and a great deal to that purpo&s;e. They parted. Co|lonel
Sackville acquainted his friends. They gave him (Churchill) all
the encouragement imaginable; conceiving that a per&s;on of &s;o great
credit in the army, and of &s;uch a con&s;iderable po&s;t in the council,
would be of mighty con&s;equence to the King's affairs. But they re|&s;olved,
at the &s;ame time, to &s;earch him to the quick; and try whether,
by informing them readily what he knew, they might depend upon his
&s;incerity. He gave them, without he&s;itation, both an account of all
the forces, preparations and de&s;igns, both in England, Scotland, and
Ireland. To which la&s;t kingdom, he &s;aid, the prince of Orange in|tended
to go him&s;elf, if the French pre&s;&s;ed too hard on the confede|rates
in the Low Country, that very campaign. He laid open that
prince's de&s;igns both by &s;ea and land; which concurring with what the
King had, from good hands, was a great argument of Churchill's &s;in|cerity.
He brought daily intelligence of incidents in the &s;ecretary's
office, in relation to the Jacobites, by which they avoided many incon|veniencies
and troubles. He de&s;ired in&s;tructions without being admitted
into the King's &s;ecrets; owning, that the villanies which, he had com|mitted,
did but too ju&s;tly debar him from expecting any confidence.
He doubted not, he &s;aid, but he could bring over many great men to
the King's party; and de&s;ired to know, whether he &s;hould endeavour
that, in reference to my lord Danby, who, he &s;aid, was the main &s;tay
to the pre&s;ent government; or join with the party in parliament, who
were contriving his ruin. He proffered to bring over, if required, the
troops in Flanders. But he rather propo&s;ed to act in concert with many
who were, the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, to endeavour to get all foreigner &s;ent out
of the kingdom. He advi&s;ed the King not to bring with him too great
<PB N="238" REF="252">
a force: that a French power was too terrifying to the people: that
20,000 men would be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Churchill de&s;ired the King to enjoin lord Godolphin not to lay down
his place in the Trea&s;ury; as he mu&s;t be made &s;erviceable in that po&s;t.
He &s;aid, for him&s;elf, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to be at re&s;t till he
had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, made an atonement, by endeavouring, though
at the utmo&s;t peril of his life, to re&s;tore his injured prince and beloved
ma&s;ter. His comportment upon the whole &s;eemed candid, and his pe|nitence
&s;incere. The King was always ready to forget the greate&s;t in|juries,
upon the lea&s;t &s;hew of amendment. He confirmed what he had
&s;aid in per&s;on, by a letter, Jan. 20th, 169 0/1; and in May 30th, 1691,
he a&s;&s;ured the King, that upon the lea&s;t command, he would abandon
wife, children, and country, to regain and pre&s;erve his e&s;teem. He,
however, declined to bring over the troops in Flanders. The King
wrote to him, April 20, 1691. He wrote him in the mo&s;t good natured
manner in the world. The Queen in&s;erted a few words with her own
hand, to te&s;tify her being reconciled to him. He ordered Godolphin to
keep his employments, to be more &s;erviceable; he having forgot his
former &s;cruples about betraying his tru&s;t. Lord Dartmouth propo&s;ed to
come over him&s;elf, provided he could have the command of a &s;qua|dron
of French men of war. But the court of France were not for
tru&s;ting him; be&s;ides, he was &s;oon after &s;ent to the Tower.</P>
<P>The army in Ireland took the field. The French were &s;low in com|ing,
but they at length arrived. Athlone made a good defence; yet
was at la&s;t &s;urprized. Tyrconnel leaving the army, retreated to Li|merick.
Animo&s;ities, as is u&s;ual in misfortunes, increa&s;ed. The army,
from 17,000, was reduced to 11,000. St. Ruth being piqued at the
di&s;grace at Athlone, re&s;olved to wait for the enemy at Aghrim. He
encamped him&s;elf, on a ri&s;ing ground, in two lines. Two pa&s;&s;es were
before him; one at the old ca&s;tle of Aghrim, on the left of the foot;
the other 300 yards advanced from the right. On Sunday, July 12, the
enemy advanced to the bog &s;ide, while their hor&s;e took a great round to
flank the right. They had po&s;itive orders from Ginkle, not to come to
a deci&s;ive action. But being once engaged, the affair was brought to
a point. The Iri&s;h behaved with great &s;pirit, to &s;ecure their liberties,
as an oppre&s;&s;ed people. They convinced the Engli&s;h they had to do
<PB N="239" REF="253">
with men, no le&s;s re&s;olute than them&s;elves. Never a&s;&s;ault was made
with greater fury, nor &s;u&s;tained with greater ob&s;tinacy. The Iri&s;h foot
repul&s;ed the enemy &s;everal times, particularly in the center. They even
looked upon the victory as certain. St. Ruth was in a tran&s;port of joy,
to &s;ee the foot, of whom he had a mean opinion, behave them&s;elves &s;o
well. Fearing that the enemy &s;hould out&s;lank his troops with their left,
he ordered the &s;econd line of his left to march to the right. His orders
were ill executed. The officer who commanded, &s;uppo&s;ing the bog in
the front would prevent the enemy from advancing, ordered a battalion
of the fir&s;t line to file off al&s;o. Tho&s;e who &s;tood in awe of that batta|lion,
took courage when it was gone. They pa&s;&s;ed the bog on hurdles.
They formed them&s;elves on the Iri&s;h &s;ide of the bog. St. Ruth ad|vanced
at the head of the cavalry. He would &s;oon have di&s;per&s;ed them;
as they were yet but a forming. He was unfortunately killed by a
cannon &s;hot. Endeavours were u&s;ed, in vain, to conceal his death.
The life-guard &s;quadron near him &s;topping, the re&s;t did the &s;ame. The
enemy profited by the accident. They advanced. A panic had &s;eized
the Iri&s;h. They fled, and left a compleat victory to the enemy. Night
coming on, prevented a pur&s;uit. The Iri&s;h, however, lo&s;t 4000 men.
The lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h was not much inferior. Had they pur&s;ued their
victory, and marched to Limerick, they would have fini&s;hed the war at
one blow.</P>
<P>Tyrconnel re&s;umed his authority on St. Ruth's death. He propo&s;ed
to defend Limerick. The enemy appeared before it, on the 25th of
Augu&s;t. He &s;ent an expre&s;s to St. Germains. The King was, beyond
mea&s;ure, afflicted. He laid the ca&s;e before the French court. Some
&s;uccours were prepared. Some money was ordered. Colonel Lutterel
treats with the enemy about the &s;urrender of Limerick. Mighty in|clinations
were rai&s;ed in the army to &s;ubmit. Tyrconnel, though not
apprized of the treachery, was &s;en&s;ible of the evil. One Balderic O'Don|nel
was long engaged in hidden and trea&s;onable practices. It appeared
afterwards, that there was a de&s;ign of putting the kingdom into the
hands of the ancient Iri&s;h, independent of, and on an equal foot with
England. This it was that had rendered O'Donnel &s;o popular, and
rai&s;ed him &s;uch a mighty crowd of followers, with which he lived, in a
manner, at di&s;cretion, while the war la&s;ted; and he then made his peace

with the enemy, without the King's privity or con&s;ent. Lord Lucan,
though he oppo&s;ed Tyrconnel, oppo&s;ed al&s;o the trea&s;onable practices,
with regard to the independence of Ireland. Lutterel's &s;ecret corre|&s;pondence
was di&s;covered by his means. Lutterel was &s;eized. He was
tried; but he had too many friends to be condemned. He was &s;entenced
only to remain in pri&s;on during the King's plea&s;ure. The fire was rather
&s;mothered than extingui&s;hed by this act of ju&s;tice. Lucan's credit de|clined,
when he &s;ided with Tyrconnel. The latter, &s;truck with a fit of
an apoplexy, died in two days, when he was on the point of reconciling
the Iri&s;h to them&s;elves. The enemy, by Clifford's neglect, pa&s;&s;ed the
river. The town was forced into terms. The Iri&s;h, however, had the
courage to in&s;i&s;t upon, and dexterity to obtain extraordinary articles.
Thirty thou&s;and men, fir&s;t and la&s;t, were permitted to pa&s;s into France.
Thus was Ireland, after three years ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, reduced by the
power and riches of England. But though the King lo&s;t the country,
he pre&s;erved the hearts of a majority of the people.</P>
<P>In Scotland, the Highlanders were forced to lay down their arms, the
King not being able to &s;upport them with money. They &s;ent the earl
of Dumfermling to the King. But before he received their information,
he was &s;en&s;ible of their condition. Though his abilities and intere&s;t
were exhau&s;ted by Ireland, he contrived to &s;end &s;ome &s;mall relief to
Scotland, in a &s;hip from Nantes. He was too tender of their lives to
propo&s;e to them any de&s;perate action; and he, therefore, would not
pretend to do more than he was really able. He gave them a true &s;tate
of his affairs. He recommended to them a &s;hew of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the
rebels, to pre&s;erve their own quiet; being perfectly a&s;&s;ured of their
hearts at all times. He &s;ent money to be di&s;tributed among their own
prote&s;tant clergy. They accordingly made their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But, con|trary
to all faith, the prince of Orange, by an order which Nero him&s;elf
would have a horror of, ordered the &s;oldiers to ma&s;&s;acre the Glenco-men
in cold blood. It was hard to imagine, that the prince of Orange could
apprehend danger from &s;uch a handful of men. But he either thought
that &s;everity nece&s;&s;ary to make an example of, or he had a particular pique
again&s;t that clan. Either of the&s;e rea&s;ons, according to his morality,
was &s;ufficient to do an inhuman thing. To ob&s;truct his ambition, or to
give him a per&s;onal offence, expo&s;ed men equally to his revenge. Yet
<PB N="241" REF="257">
this was the pretended a&s;&s;ertion of the lives and liberties of the Engli&s;h
nation, to Whom all oaths of duty and religion were made a &s;acrifice of,
rather than he &s;hould not reign over it. The Ba&s;s was the only foot of
land, if it may be &s;o called, that the King now remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of, of all his dominions.</P>
<P>The war being ended in Scotland and Ireland, the King &s;ettled him|&s;elf
and his way of living &s;uitable to his pen&s;ion.</P>

The violent current, which had borne down every thing before it, abated.
The hearts of many remained true, though their hands were tyed.
Every day cleared up more and more the dark and hidden contrivances,
which had produced the Revolution. The number of the King's friends:
increa&s;ed daily. They propo&s;ed &s;chemes for his re&s;toration. The cor|re&s;pondence
with Churchill was kept up. Though his preten&s;ions were
liable to &s;u&s;picion, from his former conduct, his profe&s;&s;ions had the ap|pearance
of &s;incerity. There was &s;ome cau&s;e to believe, him; as both
he and his mi&s;tre&s;s, the prince&s;s of Denmark, were out of favour with
the prince of Orange. Neither of them reaped any advantage from
their pa&s;t infidelity, but the infamy of having committed &s;uch great
crimes. The mo&s;t intere&s;ted may be credited, when they can rea&s;on|ably
hope to mend their fortune, and better their condition, by return|ing
to their duty.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s of Denmark, her&s;elf could not then be pre&s;umed to di&s;|&s;emble.
She wrote to the King a mo&s;t penitential and dutiful letter. This
was a more than ordinary, mark of the &s;incerity of Churchill, as he had
&s;uch power with her. The King received not her letter till he was at
La Hogue. Her letter was this:</P>
<P>&startq;I have been very de&s;irous of &s;ome &s;afe opportunity to make you a
&s;incere and humble offer of my duty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to you; and to beg
you will be a&s;&s;ured, that I am both truly concerned for the misfortune
of your condition, and &s;en&s;ible, as I ought to be, of my own unhap|pine&s;s,
as to what you may think I have contributed to it. If wi&s;hes
could recal what is pa&s;t, I had long &s;ince redeemed my fault. I am

&s;en&s;ible it would have been a great relief to me, if I could have
found means, to have acquainted you earlier with my repenting
thoughts. But I hope they may find the advantage by coming late of
being le&s;s &s;u&s;pected of in&s;incerity, than perhaps they would have been,
at any time before. It will be a great addition to the ca&s;e I propo&s;e to
my own mind, by this plain confe&s;&s;ion, if I am &s;o happy as to find it
brings any real &s;atisfaction to yours; and that you are as indulgent and
ea&s;y to receive my humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions as I am truly de&s;irous to make
them, in a free, di&s;intere&s;ted acknowledgment of my fault, for no other
end, but to de&s;erve and receive your pardon.</P>
<P>&startq;I had a great mind to beg of you to make one compliment for me. But
fearing that the expre&s;&s;ions which would be propere&s;t for me to make
u&s;e of, might perhaps be the lea&s;t convenient for a letter, I mu&s;t con|tent
my&s;elf at pre&s;ent with hoping that the bearer will be able to &s;upply
it for me. December 1&s;t, 1691.&endq;</P>
<P>Lloyd brought the above letter. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el, who had the com|mand
of the Engli&s;h fleet, &s;till pretended to be in the King's intere&s;t.
He was di&s;&s;atisfied with the King's declaration. There was a nece&s;&s;ity
of doing all that was po&s;&s;ible to content a per&s;on, who held the crown
of England &s;o far in his hands. Lloyd was Ru&s;&s;el's particular friend.
Ru&s;&s;el had &s;everal conferences before he came away with the prince&s;s of
Denmark. He expre&s;&s;ed his earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;erve the King. He &s;aid
the people were inclined enough to his &s;ide again, if the King would take
a right line to continue them &s;o. He advi&s;ed him, if he wi&s;hed to reign
as a catholic King over a prote&s;tant people, he mu&s;t forget the pa&s;t and
grant a general pardon: and that, as for him, he made no &s;tipulations
for him&s;elf; &s;aying, it was the public good and no private advantage
made him enter into this affair. He told him, therefore, that if he met
the French fleet, he would fight it, were even the King him&s;elf on board.
But that the method he propo&s;ed to &s;erve the King, was by going out of
the way with the Engli&s;h fleet. This was an odd way to re&s;tore the
King by fighting him. He, however, meant nothing but advantage
to him&s;elf; as the preparations of the French made a re&s;toration proba|ble.
He was determined to rai&s;e his fortune, which ever way the bal|lance
inclined. Had the French pa&s;&s;ed, by accident, or prevailed, by
<PB N="243" REF="259">
force, he would have made a merit of &s;erving the King;&mdash;and &s;hould
the contrary happen, he could ea&s;ily keep his credit with the pre&s;ent
government. But the King was forced to &s;eem well contented, with
what tho&s;e men were plea&s;ed to promi&s;e. The de&s;ign was &s;o well laid,
that had not fortune cro&s;&s;ed him, (as it ever did,) &s;o many different ways,
there was no rea&s;on to apprehend a mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>The King arrived at Caen, in Normandy, on the 24th of April, N. S.
Tourville had orders to &s;eek out the Engli&s;h fleet, then &s;uppo&s;ed to be
alone. The tran&s;ports in coming round from Havre, were mi&s;erably
battered in a &s;torm. He came into the pre&s;ence of the enemy. Piqued
at de Seignelay's reflections on his conduct off Beachy-head, he thought
fit to ob&s;erve his orders to the letter. He maintained the fight with
equality enough, till about four in the afternoon. There was &s;ome doubt
of Carter. But his de&s;igns remained a &s;ecret, by his being killed at the
beginning of the action. It was even in doubt, by what hand he died.
The French &s;uffered little. The calm cea&s;ed. The un&s;ea&s;onable be|haviour
of Tourville brought on a &s;econd engagement. He was a&s;ham|ed
of &s;hewing his &s;tern to an enemy. He tru&s;ted too much to the Royal
Sun, a mighty &s;hip of 120 guns. He could never di&s;engage him&s;elf
after. He was forced to the &s;curvy alternative of either running a&s;hore
or of being taken. When even they ran into La Hogue, they might be
&s;aved had they followed the King's advice; who recommended to man
the &s;hips with the land troops, to keep off the Engli&s;h frigates and boats.
The admiral was ob&s;tinate. Yet his men abandoned the &s;hips, upon the
fir&s;t approach of the Engli&s;h; though only in &s;haloops. The King was
beyond mea&s;ure afflicted. But he re&s;olved to continue his endeavours
for his re&s;toration. He now began to wean him&s;elf from the world and
all thoughts of pre&s;ent happine&s;s. He &s;aw that Providence de&s;igned to
lead him, through the paths of affliction to his grave. He, however
continued his corre&s;pondence with England, particularly with Churchill
and Ru&s;&s;el. Middleton, on who&s;e management the King chiefly relied,
to try to give &s;trength and &s;tability to the&s;e &s;cattered reeds, began to treat
with his friends again. Shrew&s;bury, Danby, Godolphin, Ru&s;&s;el and
others, &s;eemed de&s;irous that the King &s;hould be re&s;tored; and &s;o were
many, from the di&s;mal pro&s;pect of continual wars, till things &s;hould
return to their old channel.</P>

<P>Soon after the French fleet was beat by Ru&s;&s;el, captain Lloyd

the King's friends in England, with a me&s;&s;age of great con&s;equence,

The King, therefore, came to St. Germains, and &s;ent Mr. Carryl to
England, about Augu&s;t; who did not return till January, 1693. He

<P>The King &s;ends again to admiral Ru&s;&s;el.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpher&s;on's Extracts.</NOTE> Hearing that he was re|&s;tored
to the command of the fleet, he (the King) was re&s;olved not to
let &s;lip the lea&s;t glimmering of hopes. He &s;ent Lloyd privately to him,
in the beginning of March, to try, as he was in the &s;ame power, whe|ther
he was in the &s;ame mind. He declared that he had the &s;ame good|will.
But he refu&s;ed to go out of the way. The lord Churchill wrote
to the King in the preceding December. He advi&s;ed him to bring with
him 25,000 men and arms for 7,000 men. He wrote al&s;o a letter dated
Feb. 28th, 1694. He told him, that lord Shrew&s;bury was &s;o pre&s;&s;ed to
receive his former office of &s;ecretary, that he was afraid he could not
re&s;i&s;t. But though he altered his condition, he a&s;&s;ured him that he would
not alter his inclinations. Yet Churchill him&s;elf was the advi&s;er of
Shrew&s;bury, hoping he would do him&s;elf the &s;ame good turn. He told
the King, that he him&s;elf was &s;olicited to come into office; but that he
would do nothing without the King's con&s;ent. On May the 4th, the
lord Churchill gave notice to the King of the de&s;ign upon Bre&s;t.</P>

The prince&s;s of Orange dies December 28, O. S. The King made no
efforts upon her death. Her proximity of blood was the prince of
Orange's chief &s;upport. He hoped the government might &s;hake and
unhinge it&s;elf. The prince&s;s of Denmark, notwith&s;tanding her pro|fe&s;&s;ions
and late repentance, appeared to be more &s;atisfied with the prince
of Orange, though he had u&s;ed her ill and u&s;urped upon her right, than
that her father, who had always cheri&s;hed her beyond expre&s;&s;ion, &s;hould
be re&s;tored. So that all that the King got was an additional affliction to
tho&s;e he had already undergone, by &s;eeing his child he loved &s;o tenderly
per&s;evere, to her death, in &s;uch a &s;ignal &s;tate of di&s;obedience and di&s;|loyalty;
and to hear her extolled, for a crime as for the highe&s;t virtue,
by the mercenary flatterers of the times; even arch bi&s;hop Tenni&s;on
reckoned, among her virtues, her contradictions; and that &s;he had
got the better of her duty to a parent, in con&s;ideration of her religion
and her country. But his own children had lo&s;t all bowels of compa&s;&s;ion
and duty for the King. The King was much afflicted at her manner of
dying.</P>

No. 7.</NOTE> &s;ays Nairne in an adverti&s;ement concerning James's papers, &startq;is a collection of &s;everal pious meditations of our Holy King, left writ in his own hand on loo&s;e papers, which, after his death, have been put together, and are now pre&s;erved with that care which &s;uch precious remains de&s;erve. The greater part of them &s;eem de|&s;igned only for his own private u&s;e, to imprint more deeply, in his memory, tho&s;e great truths of Chri&s;tianity, which had &s;o fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him: for though they are writ upon &s;everal &s;ubjects, all tending to policy and religion; yet none of them had any titles put to them, to di&s;tingui&s;h the matters treated in each of them. But, for the ea&s;e and benefit of the reader, titles are now put to them, &s;uitable to the matter they contain. Some three or four of them the reader will find occa&s;ionally in&s;erted in the relation of his life, which are not, therefore, here in&s;erted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was the con&s;tant practice of this King, ever &s;ince he fir&s;t appeared in the world, to write &s;hort notes, from time to time, of all that was remarkable in the affairs wherein he had any &s;hare. All the&s;e memoirs of pa&s;&s;ages, which occurred before his la&s;t e&s;cape out of England, have been happily pre&s;erved, though they were writ on &s;everal loo&s;e pa|pers; and they may po&s;&s;ibly &s;erve hereafter, as materials for making a complete and authentic hi&s;tory of his whole life; they being &s;afely kept, by his Maje&s;ty's order, in the library of the Scotch college at Paris. But the&s;e writ by him &s;ince the revolution, are of a quite different nature from the former. In the fir&s;t, he &s;ets down what pa&s;&s;ed abroad in the world and in the public affairs wherein he was concerned; in the&s;e, he de&s;cribes what pa&s;&s;ed within his own &s;oul, filled with the &s;entiments of repentance and devotion.
It may be truly &s;aid, that his own picture is to be &s;een in them, drawn to the life, as he was in his latter days for he practi&s;ed him&s;elf all that he hath here writ; and his out|ward actions, no le&s;s than the thoughts and affections of his mind, were all conformable to the rules and actions he here &s;ets down.&endq;</P>
<P>There are but few of the&s;e pieces found, among Mr. Nairne's manu&s;cripts. Some of them are in Engli&s;h, in Nairne's hand, and &s;ome in French in an unknown hand, and others in Nairne's, interlined with corrections in James's own hand. A few only of &s;uch, as are thus authenticated, are in&s;erted here, as a &s;pecimen. N. N. is his &s;on, the duke of Berwick.

<HEAD>Fatherly advice to N. N.</HEAD>
<P>I own to you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">James $word$ advice to his &s;on, the duke of Berwick.</NOTE> it is no ea&s;y matter for a young unexperienced man that
has courage and ambition, and is in the vigour of his youth, to live in
the world and not to be led away by its deceitful plea&s;ures and promi&s;es
of imaginary happine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii fol. No. 7 and 8.</NOTE> e&s;pecially &s;ince there are &s;o few of tho&s;e, who&s;e
company he frequents, who live like good chri&s;tians; and, when they
find a young man who has good and virtuous inclinations, they endea|vour
to in&s;pire him with lewd and athei&s;tical principles, and to draw
him into tho&s;e vices to which they them&s;elves are mo&s;t inclined: and, if
it happens, that the young man has a friend or relation, who gives him
good advice and would hinder him from running headlong into the&s;e
dangerous and pernicious cour&s;es, he is turned into ridicule, by the&s;e
mini&s;ters of iniquity. If the advi&s;er is a little advanced in years, they
laugh at him, and call him a bigot, or they repre&s;ent him as a man who
has &s;ome prejudice again&s;t them, and who, when he was young, &s;ati|ated
him&s;elf with tho&s;e very plea&s;ures, which he now condemns in
others.</P>
<P>This is the doctrine commonly preached to a young man by his com|panions,
when he fir&s;t comes into the world. They make it a point of
honour to him to damn him&s;elf, &s;aying that it will be time enough for
him to be converted when he grows old; and that none, but &s;uch as are
<PB N="248" REF="264">
weak, &s;tupid, and hypocondrical, deprive them&s;elves of the plea&s;ures
of this world, or trouble them&s;elves with frequenting churches, hearing
&s;ermons, or reading good books.</P>
<P>It is by the&s;e arguments &s;ugge&s;ted by the devil and by ill example,
that young men like you are daily perverted. Do not, therefore, allow
your&s;elf to be deceived by &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es; but let found rea&s;on and the
maxims of religion guide you. You have been in many dangers. You
have often looked death in the face, and have &s;een many fall near you,
where you have been pre&s;erved. Con&s;ider how much rea&s;on there is to
fear, that the greate&s;t number of the&s;e have been thrown headlong into
hell, to endure an eternity of torments; and con&s;ider, at the &s;ame time,
how unprepared you was to die at that time, what would have been your
fate, if you had been carried off in &s;uch a &s;tate, and how much you owe
to the bounty of the Almighty, who did not allow you to be of the num|ber
of the&s;e unhappy per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I know you may an&s;wer, and others may &s;ugge&s;t to you, that I did
not follow my&s;elf, when I was of your age nor for many years after, the
good advice which I now give to you. I own, with confu&s;ion, that this
is but too true. That I was led a&s;tray by the vanities and &s;inful plea&s;ures
of this world; and that I did not give my&s;elf time to con&s;ider what was
the duty of a Chri&s;tian. This, I &s;ay, I own, to my confu&s;ion; and,
when I reflect on it now, I tremble at the remembrance of the danger,
in which I was then: for if God had not mercifully touched my heart,
by extraordinary ways; and, by the rebellion of my &s;ubjects, made me
&s;en&s;ible how greatly I had my&s;elf rebelled again&s;t him; in all probability,
I would have been eternally lo&s;t. But you ought to con&s;ider, that this
was a miracle of the providence and goodne&s;s of God towards me; and,
you know, that God does not always work miracles, and what happened
to me is too &s;ingular an in&s;tance to &s;erve as an example to you. Take,
therefore, the warning which I give you, not to follow my example in
&s;inning, but in repenting. I give you this advice, as a father, who is
indeed under obligations to promote the temporal intere&s;ts of his chil|dren;
but under &s;till greater to contribute to their eternal welfare.&endq;</P>

but would, the moment the King was a&s;hore, in their &s;everal
counties. Mr. Powel was &s;ent over, in January or February, to per|&s;uade
the King to come with that force and to give rea&s;ons for it. All
things were ready at the end of February. On the twenty-fifth, the
King of France &s;ent to the King to go to Calais, where, the King arrived
on the &s;econd of March. A propo&s;al had been made, at the end of
1693, for &s;eizing and bringing off the prince of Orange; but the King
rejected it. It was afterwards propo&s;ed by others; and again rejected.
In the year 1695, one Clinch propo&s;ed it, and de&s;ired a warrant to im|power
him. The King rejected it, and charged, him not to meddle in it,
or &s;peak more about it. Yet, when he came to England, he did to his

Mr. Ben&s;on [Fr.

<P>The King is pre&s;&s;ed again to make another attempt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Macpher&s;on's Extracts.</NOTE> He was pre|vailed
upon, by conceiving the kingdom to be much better di&s;po&s;ed, and
the conjuncture more favourable. Before the King entered upon his ex|pedition,
he found great difficulties about wording his declaration, for
the Calais expedition. Melfort had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at the &s;olicitations of
his friends in England. Middleton, who &s;ucceeded him, was of opinion,
that the King ought to adhere to his la&s;t declaration. The King left St.
Germains, February 28th. The troops intended for the inva&s;ion began
to draw near Dunkirk and Calais. He was ha&s;tened off too &s;oon, by
<PB N="254" REF="270">
the court of France. The alarm was taken, before things were ripe;
and the intended expedition fell to the ground. Be&s;ides the misfortunes
common to this expedition with the re&s;t of the King's attempts, it brought
obloquy upon him, by its being thought that he was privy to, or ap|proved
of, the de&s;ign on the per&s;on of the prince of Orange. Certain
gentlemen, thinking to do the King good &s;ervice by it, combined among
them&s;elves. Their fir&s;t project was to &s;urprize and &s;eize the prince of
Orange, and carry him into France. But finding that impracticable, if
they &s;crupled his life, they were by degrees drawn into a re&s;olution of
attacking him as he came from Hampton Court, or from hunting; and
if they found no po&s;&s;iblity of carrying him off alive, to make no diffi|culty
of killing him. There is no occa&s;ion to argue upon this point, the
King was neither privy to this de&s;ign, nor did he commi&s;&s;ion the per|&s;ons;
though he &s;uffered mo&s;t unde&s;ervedly, both in his reputation
and intere&s;t: for tho&s;e unfortunate gentlemen, by mi&s;taking me&s;&s;ages
on the one hand, and their too forward zeal on the other, the mo&s;t of
them lo&s;t their own lives, and furni&s;hed an opportunity to the King's
enemies of renewing their calumnies again&s;t him, and fix the people and
parliament, who otherwi&s;e began to waver, in the prince of Orange's in|tere&s;t
more than ever. Cro&s;by, it is more than probable, was employed
by the prince of Orange, to per&s;uade the King to the mea&s;ure. His
earne&s;tne&s;s in this, both in words and by his letter, reque&s;ting permi&s;&s;ion
from England, made the King &s;u&s;pect him; and all the an&s;wer he made
was, that he thought him mad.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ion the King gave to Sir George Berkley and others was
in order to a general in&s;urrection of the Jacobites; which he under&s;tood
they were to make as &s;oon as he appeared on the French coa&s;t, with &s;uch
a force as was agreed upon. The court of France was of the &s;ame opi|nion,
and ordered their troops not to put to &s;ea till they heard of it.
The King's friends on the other hand, meant that the King &s;hould land
fir&s;t. The matter was like to come to nothing, when they waited thus
for one another. The prince of Orange's affairs had not now a favour|able
a&s;pect. The new-called parliament were re&s;ty and refractory. Sun|derland,
who had advi&s;ed the di&s;&s;olution of his old parliament, began
now to be &s;u&s;pected by him. The King's party, called Jacobites by
way of di&s;tinction, thought it proper to blow the coals, as much as
<PB N="255" REF="271">
po&s;&s;ible. They pre&s;&s;ed hard for men and &s;hips, for the beginning of
the &s;pring. They now a&s;ked but 10 or 12 thou&s;and men. Some of
them even wrote to the King, that they were per&s;uaded, that could the
King but once come to London, or &s;ome other con&s;iderable town, with|out
any force, that the greate&s;t part of the nation would ri&s;e and re&s;tore
him. The King communicated this news to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty;
and he was, at la&s;t, encouraged to give the men; together with things
nece&s;&s;ary for a de&s;cent for the beginning of February. He &s;till pre&s;&s;ed,
that the King's friends &s;hould ri&s;e fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The duke of Berwick was accordingly &s;ent to England to head them.
Many officers went to England and Scotland; particularly many gentle|men,
who were wearied to &s;erve as common men. The King's friends
declared it impo&s;&s;ible to ri&s;e till the King &s;hould land: but that as &s;oon
as he &s;hould come, they &s;hould all run to their arms. Their reply was
&s;o rea&s;onable, that it could not be an&s;wered. A mi&s;take in di&s;cour&s;e
with Mr. Powel, who had come to St. Germains, with an account of the
&s;tate of England, was the thing that prevailed with the King to move
them to it. Mr. Powel &s;poke with &s;o much zeal, that the King thought,
that the Jacobites propo&s;ed to ri&s;e, when they &s;hould hear of his de&s;ign
to pa&s;s into England; and, before Mr. Powel had put his reque&s;t into
writing, the King fortuned to meet with the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and
told him, his friends in England were ready to ri&s;e whenever he re|quired
them. The King perceived, when Mr. Powel committed his
me&s;&s;age to writing, that he had been mi&s;taken. But for fear of alarm|ing
the French mini&s;ters, he did not think it proper to &s;top their pre|parations,
by un&s;aying what he had &s;aid. The mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King's
orders were &s;o well obeyed, by Mr. Ponchartrain of the marine, and
Barbe&s;ieux of the land department, that things were ready, at the time
appointed, which was the end of February.</P>
<P>Though things were carried on with all imaginable &s;ecrecy, it could
not be po&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;emble 3 or 400 &s;ail of great and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, from
different ports, without making &s;ome noi&s;e. The Dutch believed, that
the French had a de&s;ign on Zealand, and &s;ent thither troops. No de|&s;ign
was &s;u&s;pected to be laid again&s;t England, till it was heard the King
had gone for Calais, which the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King thought &s;it he &s;hould
do, as the tran&s;ports were to rendezvous there on the 25th of February.
<PB N="256" REF="272">
He &s;ent Pontchartrain to the King, on that day, and, as the &s;ecret
could be kept no longer, he &s;aid, he advi&s;ed him, if he thought &s;it, to
go down to the &s;ea-&s;ide; but not to let the men embark till he heard
of the propo&s;ed in&s;urrection in England. The mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King pro|po&s;ed
to come the next day, to St. Germains, to &s;ettle the la&s;t mea&s;ures
with the King. He came accordingly. He repeated what his mini&s;ter
had &s;aid; and &s;till taking it for granted, that the ri&s;ing would begin
before the King could reach Calais, he pre&s;&s;ed, for that very rea&s;on, his
&s;etting out immediately. But though the King had no great mind to
go, till he had a return from the duke of Berwick, who had not been gone
a fortnight; yet, for certain rea&s;ons, he thought &s;it not to mention it;
and acquie&s;ced in going in two days. He arrived at Calais, on the 2d
of March.</P>
<P>The King met at St. Dennis a &s;ervant, from the duke of Berwick,
with a letter to Middleton. The duke him&s;elf, having his chai&s;e broke,
remained at Clermont, till it &s;hould be mended. The King under&s;tood
from &s;ome hints, in the letter, that he had not &s;ucceeded. He ac|quainted
the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King of his doubts. But he re&s;olved to
proceed. He came to Clermont. He knew then the whole matter. He
ordered Berwick to proceed to Calais. It was a great misfortune, that
the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King had not a right notion of the matter from the
beginning, and that the King dur&s;t not di&s;abu&s;e him, for fear his mini|&s;ters,
who were ever aver&s;e to &s;uch expeditions, &s;hould qua&s;h all, with|out
&s;o much as a trial. He &s;till hoped, that &s;omething might happen,
upon which he could found a reque&s;t to let the troops &s;ail. He no
&s;ooner arrived at Calais, but according to his u&s;ual fortune, he found his
expectations at an end. Several gentlemen had been &s;eized for an at|tempt
on the prince of Orange's per&s;on. England was in a ferment.
There could be no expectations that the Jacobites &s;hould ri&s;e. It was a
more than u&s;ual trouble to the King to &s;ee his project broke, his hopes
bla&s;ted, his friends ruined, by their pur&s;uing methods contrary to his
judgment, and without his con&s;ent. Tho&s;e who were executed declared,
indeed, at their deaths, that the King was no ways privy to the de&s;ign
upon the prince of Orange's per&s;on. The propo&s;al had been fre|quently
made, for &s;everal years, but he always rejected it with vehe|mence.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="273">
The prince of Orange had a per&s;onal pique again&s;t Sir John Fenwick,
for &s;ome reflecting expre&s;&s;ions, when he &s;erved in Holland; and, accord|ing
to his wonted clemency, he was re&s;olved to move heaven and earth
to have his life. He could not get two witne&s;&s;es, as the laws of trea&s;on
require; and he, therefore, cau&s;ed a bill of attainder to be brought
again&s;t him, in the hou&s;e of commons. Thus exerting the utmo&s;t ex|tent
of the legi&s;lative power to take away irregularly one man's life,
which could not be of &s;uch mighty con&s;equence to the public quiet. Sir
John Fenwick's accu&s;ation of lord Godolphin, lord Churchill, and ad|miral
Ru&s;&s;el, and &s;everal others, did great prejudice to the King's af|fairs.
This, indead of appea&s;ing, heightened the prince of Orange's
rage again&s;t him; and added the weight of the&s;e powerful men to the
heavy hand of their ma&s;ter. Though Sir John was not believed, it con|vinced
many, that their &s;ecrets were not &s;o well kept, as they could wi&s;h;
and they afterwards gave this, as a rea&s;on for di&s;continuing their corre|&s;pondence.
It is doubtful, whether this was a di&s;advantage, in re&s;pect
of &s;uch men. It was a check, however, upon better men. The exe|cution
of his friends was more affecting to him, than his own mi&s;|fortunes.</P>
<P>He, however, had &s;till &s;ome glimmering views toward a re&s;toration.
The prince of Orange's ill &s;tate of health made people believe he could
not live long. He was become &s;o drop&s;ical, that it became manife&s;t he
could be of no long continuance. Had he died, the King would return
into England and throw him&s;elf on the good-nature of the Engli&s;h,
though three men &s;hould not follow him. It could not enter into his
brea&s;t, that the people of England could offer indignities to a heart that
loved them &s;o tenderly. But if it was God's will, that he &s;hould con|&s;ummate
his &s;ufferings, without any mixture of pro&s;perity, and end his
days in bani&s;hment, in which &s;o great a part of his life had been &s;pent,
he re&s;igned him&s;elf to the will of providence. But the ill health of the
prince of Orange rai&s;ed a new ob&s;tacle. The prince&s;s of Denmark,
though &s;he had all along kept up a fair corre&s;pondence with the King,
full of a&s;&s;urances of duty and repentance, began now to be allured, with
the hopes of the crown. She wrote to the King to know, whether he
would plea&s;e to permit her to accept the crown, &s;hould the prince of
Orange die, and it be offered to her, according to the act of &s;ettle|ment
<PB N="258" REF="274">
made in the convention. She accompanied this reque&s;t, with a
&s;eeming &s;en&s;e of her duty, and a readine&s;s to make re&s;titution, when op|portunity
&s;hould &s;erve; and that &s;hould &s;he refu&s;e it, con&s;idering the
pre&s;ent diipo&s;ition of the kingdom, it would only remove the King the
further from the hopes of recovering his right, by putting the govern|ment
into wor&s;e hands, out of which he would not &s;o ea&s;ily retrieve it.
But this was no ways &s;uiting to the King's temper. He was not for per|mitting
ill, that good might come of it. He could &s;uffer inju&s;tice with
patience; but he could never be brought to countenance it; be&s;ides he
knew, that of all re&s;titutions, none is harder to make than that of a
crown. The King excu&s;ed him&s;elf to his daughter; and his re&s;olution
of putting him&s;elf in the hands of his &s;ubjects, put an end to the pro|po&s;al.</P>
<P>But the&s;e were views at a di&s;tance. The King turned his thoughts to
reap a Chri&s;tian fruit, from the &s;eeds of affliction. But while he was
turning his thoughts on a heavenly crown, an earthly one was offered
to him; not indeed that which was his due, and which for that rea&s;on
alone he de&s;ired, but that of Poland. His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty &s;ent
M. de Pomponne to the King; that the abbe Polignac, his amba&s;&s;ador
in Poland, wrote, that the people of that country had thoughts of him
in the election they were to make of a new King. That &s;ome particular
diets had already named them. The King's friends were &s;anguine for it.
But he made no other reply, than that he &s;hould ever retain a grateful
remembrance of the e&s;teem and kindne&s;s tho&s;e per&s;ons had &s;hewn him.
That, however, he could not accept it if offered; much le&s;s would he u&s;e
any endeavours to obtain it. That it would amount to an abdication
indeed of what was really his due; and therefore was re&s;olved to remain
as he was, though he had le&s;s hopes of being re&s;tored than ever, rather
than do the lea&s;t act to prejudice his family. That there could not be
a greater in&s;tance, that it was the public good and the intere&s;t of the
prince his &s;on, and not a thir&s;t after rule and dominion, that made the
King never lay a&s;ide the endeavours of regaining his right.</P>
<P>The King received intelligence of a treaty of peace being on foot pre|judicial
to his intere&s;t. He wrote thus, upon the occa&s;ion, to the abbe
la Trappe: &startq;Though his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty has the &s;ame affection

all treaties and accommodations, when he found the confede|rate
princes no ways di&s;po&s;ed to do him ju&s;tice; yet there was one ar|ticle
privately &s;tipulated, which, had not the King too ha&s;tily rejected,
might have rendered his po&s;terity ea&s;y, and his people happy. His mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty had underhand prevailed with the prince of Orange to
con&s;ent that the prince of Wales &s;hould &s;uccced to the throne of Eng|land
after his death. That mercenary prince, it &s;eems, had no great re|gard
to the pretended ends of his coming, nor to the acts of parliament,
which excluded the prince of Wales, and all of that per&s;ua&s;ion, from the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He had, under the notion of pre&s;erving the church of Eng|land,
u&s;urped the kingdom; and, now, (that the work was done) tho&s;e
pangs of con&s;cience were vani&s;hed, and he was very ea&s;y on that head,
and ready to leave the church to Providence for the future, not caring
under who&s;e government it fell afterwards, &s;o he was &s;ecure of the
throne for his life. For this rea&s;on, he &s;hewed no great aver&s;ene&s;s to
the prince of Wales's having the preference to tho&s;e who were named by
the pretended act of &s;ettlement. How he would have brought about in
parliament this matter does not appear; becau&s;e it never came to a trial.
But when this &s;eeming advantage to the family was propo&s;ed to the
King, he could not &s;upport the thoughts, he &s;aid, of making his own
child an accomplice to his unju&s;t dethronement; &s;o immediately he told
his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, (who had fir&s;t made the overture to him) that
though he could &s;uffer with Chri&s;tian patience the prince of Orange's u&s;ur|pation
upon <HI>him,</HI> he could never con&s;ent that his own &s;on &s;hould do it
too. This was a point too nice to be pre&s;&s;ed, in ca&s;e of the lea&s;t reluc|tancy;
&s;o nothing more was &s;aid upon it. But had the King taken lei|&s;ure
to weigh more maturely the matter, he might have found means,
perhaps, of reconciling that apparent incongruity, and for the &s;ake of
his &s;on and po&s;terity have overlooked the inju&s;tice done to him&s;elf. But
<PB N="261" REF="277">
the King was better at &s;uffering injuries, than at conniving at them; and
the lea&s;t &s;hadow of an inju&s;tice was enough to damp, in his acceptation,

complaints, that, forgetting him&s;elf, he &s;eemed only to compa&s;&s;ionate

to &s;end away his Dutch troops; though he truckled &s;o far, as to &s;end a

authority. The treatment which doctor Burnet's treati&s;e on that &s;ubject
met with, checked others; and tended to teach the prince of Orange,
that as he owed his creation to the parliament, &s;o he mu&s;t al&s;o derive
from them his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But the King looked upon him, more as the
in&s;trument of God's ju&s;tice again&s;t him&s;elf, than as his enemy. He
never &s;aid any [p. 660.] har&s;h things of him him&s;elf, nor would he per|mit
it in others; nor could any make their court wor&s;e, than by reflect|ing,
in his pre&s;ence, upon his wor&s;t enemies. He even never failed to
pray for them. [p. 670.]</P>

<P>ON Thor&s;day morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> about &s;ix of the clock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr A&s;tle Collection, vol. ii. fol.</NOTE> the courrier which
came to the cardinal nuncio, brought me the happy news of the
birth of a prince; for which greate&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings, Heaven be prai&s;ed!
<PB N="264" REF="280">
I immediately thereupon went to Ver&s;ailles, where mon&s;ieur de Barilion's
courrier had brought the news at twelve the night before. I found foe
generall a joy in all people there, as I never yet &s;aw upon any occation.
His mo&s;t Xtian Maje&s;ty, at coming from councill to go to ma&s;&s;e, called
me to him, and, with a &s;atisfaction in his face not to be expre&s;t, told
me, that next to the King my ma&s;ter, noe man had a greater joy than
he, for the news of a prince being born; and, &s;ays he, I am the more
plea&s;ed, that Barillon writes 'tis a &s;trong and healthful child. And the
dukes de la Tremuville and Rochfaucau, with mon&s;ieur de Croi&s;&s;y, whoe
were at his waking, at which time the news was brought him by the
latter, told me, they never &s;aw any man foe joyfull.</P>
<P>His mo&s;t Xtian Maje&s;ty was al&s;o plea&s;ed to take notice to me of the
impri&s;onment of the bi&s;hops; which, till then, I was ignorant of. He
very much applauds the King's re&s;olution in that affair; and &s;aid, he
was ready to give his Maje&s;ty all manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance that was in his
power; which he &s;poke in &s;uch a cordial manner, that the &s;incerity
thereof is not to be doubted. Madame la Dauphine is indi&s;po&s;ed, and
in bed; yet &s;ent for me, and &s;aid, though &s;he &s;aw no man, yet &s;he could
not forbear rejoicing with me, upon account of the great news, and ex|pre&s;t
great joy: and the little duke of Burgundy, whil&s;t I was talking
to madame la mare&s;challe de la Motte, of his own accord, told me, that
he would that night, for joy, order three&s;core &s;u&s;ees to be fired. Ma|dame
la mare&s;challe intends, in October next, to give me &s;omething to
&s;end to the Queen, to be hung about the prince's neck, which prevents
the inconveniencys that commonly attend the breeding of teeth. The
&s;ame has been u&s;ed to the&s;e three yong princes, with good &s;ucce&s;&s;e. We

<P>YE&s;terday,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, A. L. fol.</NOTE> being St. Peter's day, the &s;even bi&s;hops were brought to
their trial, upon the information of publi&s;hing a libel, about their
refu&s;al to read, or to cau&s;e to be read, the King's declaration. Their
trial held from nine in the morning, till near &s;even in the evening. The
King's evidence, to the number of twelve, laboured to prove the bi|&s;hops
hands to the petition; which was done ob&s;curely. Lord Sunder|land
was &s;ent for, to prove the publication of the libel. His evidence
was, that, at the reque&s;t of the bi&s;hops, he brought them to the King,
to whom they delivered a paper; but could not &s;ay that it was the &s;ame
for which the information was there exhibited. The council for the
bi&s;hops in&s;i&s;ted upon their not proving, that the bi&s;hops wrote the&s;e hands;
next, that not publi&s;hing was proved; and if &s;o, that it was no libel.
There Pollexfen and Mr. Finch took no &s;mall pains to inveigh again&s;t
the King's di&s;pen&s;ing power. Serjeant Pemberton &s;aid, that what the
bi&s;hops did, was that which became them as peers; and, if the di&s;|pen&s;ing
power was again&s;t law, how came they to be criminals, for not
doing that which was again&s;t law? and &s;aid farther, that he could &s;hew
&s;everal judgments in parliament, and in ca&s;es in law, where the di&s;pen&s;|ing
power was denied. The council for the King waved the point,
though Mr. Solicitor was fiercely earne&s;t again&s;t the bi&s;hops, and took
the management upon him&s;elf; Mr. Attorney's province being to put in
a &s;moothe que&s;tion now and then. Mr ju&s;tice Powel declared him&s;elf
very freely, that he could not &s;ind the petition to be a libel; for then it
mu&s;t be &s;al&s;e, &s;candalous, and malicious. Fal&s;e it was not; becau&s;e he
took the law to be, that the King had not a di&s;pen&s;ing power; for, if
he had, mo&s;t part of the &s;tatute books might be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and
<PB N="267" REF="283">
there would be no need of parliaments. Scandalous or malicious it was
not; becau&s;e drawn with all privacy, and pre&s;ented with all humility.
Mr. ju&s;tice Holloway had a mind to &s;ay &s;omewhat to the purpo&s;e; but
did declare again&s;t the di&s;pen&s;ing power. The chief ju&s;tice doubted, as
to the proof of the publi&s;hing; but took the petition to be a libel.
Ju&s;tice Allybon believed throughout, and doubted nothing. The jury
withdrew. The hall being full, and the Palace-yard, they made three
huzzas that were heard at the Temple. The jury &s;taid till nine this
morning, Arnold a brewer till then di&s;&s;enting, when they brought in
the bi&s;hops Not guilty; which was followed with &s;o many &s;houts in the
hall, that it was with much difficulty they could be quieted. This is
the re&s;ult of the long expected cau&s;e. The court of King's Bench was
ye&s;terday and to-day very full of the nobility and gentry of the be&s;t
quality. I doubt this day's work will give ju&s;tice Powel a remove; and,
it is thought, Holloway al&s;o; there being candidates enough for the va|cancies.
Mr. &s;erjeant Lehunt had his train carried through We&s;tmin&s;ter|hall,
which is not u&s;ual; but whether ominous of promotion, I know
not. It is, however, a plain demon&s;tration of his trainbearer's igno|rance.</P>

<P>THE duke of Chandos &s;aid, that Lewis the 14th, King

of the Dutch armament, wrote a letter with his own hand to King
James the 2d; and told him, it was de&s;igned again&s;t England; offer|ing,
at the &s;ame time, to prevent the inva&s;ion, to inve&s;t Mae&s;tricht with
30,000 men, and enjoining him &s;ecrecy in the affair. King James
wrote him word, in an&s;wer, that the King of France was mi&s;taken; for
he was &s;ure the Dutch armament was intended to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Hugonots of
France. Lewis the 14th wrote back, in his own hand, that he was but
too &s;ure of his intelligence; and repeated his offer, in pre&s;&s;ing terms,
of inve&s;ting Mae&s;tricht. But King James could not be per&s;uaded of it;
and, by the return of this 2d expre&s;s, the King of France had intelli|gence,
that the Dutch had thrown 6000 men into Mae&s;tricht. Seeing
his &s;ecret di&s;covered, he expo&s;tulated with King James about it; a&s;&s;ur|ing
him, that he had &s;poke of it to no body but Louvois; and if that
mini&s;ter had blabbed the &s;ecret, he would di&s;grace him immediately, and
puni&s;h him &s;everely; but de&s;ired King James to deal truly, and tell

to have had the warrant under the King's hand and &s;eal ready. After
about an hour's attendance, Mr. Bridgeman came to the office and told
him, that he &s;hould certainly have it in the afternoon. The bi&s;hop then
de&s;ired me to go with him to the Cockpit, where he was going to wait
upon the prince&s;s Anne; telling me by the way, that he would not &s;tir
from court till he had obtained the warrant. Upon his going into the
prince&s;s's chamber, he bid me come to him at his lodgings in Old Palace|Yard,
at five o'clock in the afternoon, and bring doctor Younger along with
me. We both came and he &s;hewed us the King's order, which was very
full; but of which I thought it no way becoming to de&s;ire him to give

<P>The truth of the following anecdote is e&s;tabli&s;hed by collateral evi|dence.
The delay in re&s;toring the fellows, however, has been variably
brought as an irrefragable proof of James's de&s;ign of retracting his con|ce&s;&s;ions,
upon hearing that the prince of Orange had been brought back
by a &s;torm. This &s;torm certainly happened not till a day or two after
Sunderland wrote the official letter, which brought the bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter
&s;o precipitately to London. Though the folly of James merits
no favour, his misfortunes ought to command ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>On the twenty-&s;ixth of March, Ea&s;ter-eve, at ten at night, doctor Younger came to doctor Smith, with accounts of an expre&s;s from lady Shattleworth of her father, doctor Clarke's death, at his hou&s;e in Lanca&s;hire, recommending to him to apply to the chan|cellor for recommendations to the pre&s;ident&s;hip, declining it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>On Sunday, the tenth of April, in the afternoon, Francis Bag&s;haw, fellow of Magdalene College, by order of the vice-pre&s;ident and fellows, came to she doctor's lodgings with a petition to the King: &startq;We have been credibly informed, that Mr. Anthony Farmer, who was never of our foundation, has obtained your Maje&s;ty's recommendation to be pre&s;ident of this your Maje&s;ty's college, in the room of doctor H. Clarke, lately decea&s;ed. We do therefore, with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as becomes your mo&s;t dutiful and loyal &s;ubjects, mo&s;t humbly repre&s;ent to your &s;acred Maje&s;ty, that the &s;aid Mr. Anthony Farmer is a per&s;on, in &s;everal re&s;pects, uncapable of that character, according to our founder's &s;tatutes; and do mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty, as your Maje&s;ty &s;hall judge fitte&s;t in your princely wi&s;dom, either to leave us to the di&s;charge of our duty and con|&s;ciences, according to your Maje&s;ty's late mo&s;t gracious declaration and our founder's &s;tatute; or to recommend &s;uch a per&s;on as may be mo&s;t &s;erviceable to your Maje&s;ty and this your Maje&s;ty's college; and your Maje&s;ty's petitioners &s;hall ever pray.&endq;</P>
<P>This petition had no date, but was written and &s;ub&s;cribed the day before; Mr. Bag&s;haw and the &s;ervant &s;ent up with him, having rode a great part of the night to reach London the next day in good time.</P>
<P>Dr. Smith &s;igned it, and advi&s;ed to pre&s;ent it to the King that evening as he went or came from the cabinet council. On which he produced an order from the vice-pre&s;ident and fellows, for delivering it to the earl of Sunderland, the lord pre&s;ident, with a letter from the bi&s;hop of Winton to him, at which Smith expre&s;&s;ed an hearty &s;orrow. They went immediately to lord Sunderland's lodgings, who had ju&s;t dined. They were admitted. They told him their bu&s;ine&s;s, and gave him the petition and vi&s;itor's letter. As they were to wait on him again, he appointed Tue&s;day morning. Sir Theodore de Vaux told him next day, that no petition had teen pre&s;ented to the King or mentioned in council the night before, which made him fear Sunderland had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the petition.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day morning, April the twelvth, Smith and Bag&s;haw went to lord Sunderland's lodgings, and Smith &s;ending in their names, word was brought them, that they mu&s;t come the next day. They accordingly did &s;o in the morning. Sunderland &s;aid, &startq;Sir, I have deli|vered bi&s;hop Winton's letter and your petition to the King. The King has &s;ent his letter to the college, and he expects to be obeyed; adding, he had nothing more to &s;ay.&endq; Smith advi&s;ed Bag&s;haw to &s;et out that afternoon and carry back the an&s;wer to the college. He promi&s;ed. But Smith having heard, the fellows had re&s;olved to proceed to election, on Friday, the fifteenth, he went him&s;elf next day, Thur&s;day the fourteenth, in a flying coach to Oxford, where he arrived at nine. Bag&s;haw either came not or was concealed till next morning. Smith propo&s;ed to addre&s;s the King again. The vice-pre&s;ident agreed to it and the next two &s;eniors, Fairfax and Pud&s;ey; but all the re&s;t rejected it, and went to a pre&s;ent election. They cho&s;e doctor Hough. Dr. Clarke had been recommended by Charles the &s;econd. Mr. Charnock and Mr. R. had been &s;o cho&s;en a little before. Smith would have gone away, but was not &s;uffered. Charnock and Thomp&s;on went away. Hough and Meynard were returned by all the fellows, only two to thirteen. Hough was cho&s;en. Meynard was &s;ent with Hough to the bi&s;hop of Winton to be admitted and &s;worn, which was done immediately. Petition to the duke of Ormonde to de&s;ire his intere&s;t in favour of the election. His name was publi&s;hed, though he did not &s;ub&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>Smith had named two others better qualified. Hough's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was &s;igned by all the fellows except doctor Fairfax and doctor Smith, who had no occa&s;ion, and owned by all the college except the under porter. Obadiah Walker and others were now upbraided for not daring to &s;tand out. This made them evacuate their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by an equivocal inter|pretation. The King talking with Dr. and the vice-chancellor, complained that the fellows had not petitioned him before the election; and the vice-chancellor &s;aying they had petitioned, &startq;yes,&endq; &s;aid the King, &startq;after the election.&endq; The vi&s;itor inquired of doctor Smith about the exact time.</P>

this account.</P>
<P>When I waited upon the King, by his command, on Wedne&s;day morn|ing,
the fir&s;t of November, he told me that he had &s;ent for me, when
he had nothing but the declaration of the &s;tates of Holland. But that
the declaration of the prince of Orange was now come to his hands,
out of which he read to me that &s;hort paragraph, of the lords temporal
and &s;piritual inviting his highne&s;s over; upon which I told him, I was
confident the re&s;t of the bi&s;hops would as readily an&s;wer in the negative
as my&s;elf; and his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed then to &s;ay, he did believe us
all innocent. Next he told me, he thought it requi&s;ite we &s;hould make
&s;ome public declaration of our innocence in this matter, and likewi&s;e an
abhorrence. I then de&s;ired to &s;ee the declaration. But he refu&s;ed. I
told this matter ought to be con&s;idered. &startq;Every one,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;is
to an&s;wer for him&s;elf. But I will &s;end for my lord of Canterbury, who

<P>On Friday, the &s;econd of November, I waited upon the King with
my lord of Canterbury and others; when his Maje&s;ty told him of the
prince's declaration, and made the lord Pre&s;ton read it. Then he put
the que&s;tion round, which was an&s;wered in the negative. The King de|&s;ired
&s;ome &s;uch denial &s;hould be publi&s;hed, &s;aying it would be for his
&s;ervice. But he would not allow time to &s;end for the bi&s;hops at a di&s;|tance.
So his Grace told him, he would &s;end for tho&s;e in and about town
to con&s;ult about it. Upon which, the King repeated twice, that we &s;hould
add our di&s;like; which would be very much for his &s;ervice.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Rea&s;ons why the Bi&s;hops refu&s;ed to vindicate them&s;elves in a public manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original. Ibid.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>&startq;FIRST, We humbly be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to receive what we offer
in a favourable &s;en&s;e, &s;ince we have done nothing that can ju&s;tly
de&s;erve mi&s;con&s;truction.</P>
<P>Secondly, We humbly conceive, that a general clau&s;e in a declaration
not avowed nor publi&s;hed, is not a &s;ufficient ground for a man or number
of men to vindicate them&s;elves, as if they were concerned in it. And
further, if this declaration &s;hould be owned and publi&s;hed by the prince
of Orange, we beg leave to offer it, as our opinion to your Maje&s;ty, that
it would be a new thing and no good precedent, to put it in the power
of a foreign and general accu&s;ation to bring your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in
particular, to a vindication of them&s;elves, as if they were regularly ac|cu&s;ed
and legally tried, for a criminal corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If your Maje&s;ty &s;hould think fit to make it puni&s;hable to
read or communicate the declaration; then, by making &s;uch an addre&s;s
as is required, we &s;hould do an act grounded upon a thing which mu&s;t
not be produced; and con&s;equently we &s;hall not be at liberty to alledge
the rea&s;on of our doing it, which mu&s;t unavoidably expo&s;e us, not only
to cen&s;ure, but &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As we have in all times adhered to our duty and allegiance,
we are the le&s;s willing to do any thing now, which may di&s;tingui&s;h us as
men marked with a particular character of &s;u&s;picion, &s;ince we think our
loyalty le&s;s blemi&s;hed by not being called in que&s;tion, than it would be
by the cleare&s;t vindication that can be made of it upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fifthly, We beg leave to ob&s;erve to your Maje&s;ty, that by an addre&s;s
from a few of us, who are now in town, without the concurrence of the
greater number who are ab&s;ent, it would look to the world, as if the
bi&s;hops (who we hope are very well united) were of different opinions;
or that we, who are now here, had more particular rea&s;ons of a vindica|tion
than the re&s;t; which makes it rea&s;onable for us to be unwilling to
come within the danger of &s;uch an interpretation.</P>
<P>Sixthly, We con&s;ider that the clau&s;e in the declaration joineth the
$ords &s;piritual and temporal, &s;o that, if it has any meaning, it mu&s;t in|tend,
that there is a concurrence of many of both orders to invite them
to this attempt, which would make it more imperfect for us, even though
<PB N="279" REF="295">
all the bi&s;hops were here to make a &s;eparate vindication, where the ac|cu&s;ation
is joined and comprehends the temporal lords in it. So that, if
any notice is to be taken of it, it can be done no where &s;o naturally or
with &s;o good effect as in parliament; which, whenever your Maje&s;ty &s;hall
think fit to call, we re&s;olve to do our duty, and to employ out utmo&s;t en|deavours
for the good of the church and &s;tate, and for preventing the
mi&s;eries which now &s;eem to threaten the&s;e di&s;tracted kingdoms, and to

<HEAD>Sir George Hewit's confe&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> extracted by Mr. Malet from his uncle's
pocket-book.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;November 19th, 1709, Dr. Sheridan, the deprived bi&s;hop of Kil|more,
in Ireland, told me, at his hou&s;e in Sackville-&s;treet, in Piccadilly,
<PB N="281" REF="297">
that he &s;aw, &s;everal years ago, at the old earl of Peterburgh's hou&s;e, the
death-bed confe&s;&s;ion of Sir George Hewit, (made lord Hewit by King
William) who died at Che&s;ter, of a &s;ickne&s;s he had contracted at Dun|dalk
camp, in Ireland. In this confe&s;&s;ion he declared, that nothing
troubled his con&s;cience more than the treacherous part he had acted
again&s;t King James; and particularly, among other things, he men|tioned
a meeting at Mr. Hatton Compton's lodgings, in St. Alban's|&s;treet,
at the landing of the prince of Orange; where were pre&s;ent him|&s;elf,
the lord Churchill, the bi&s;hop of London, colonel Kirk, and
others, who&s;e names the bi&s;hop could not call to mind. Sir George
affirmed, that, at the meeting, it was debated, how they &s;hould be&s;t fur|ther
the de&s;igns of the prince of Orange, and defeat tho&s;e of King
James, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s they were &s;en&s;ible would be the ruin of them&s;elves
and their religion. It was, therefore, then re&s;olved, that King James
&s;hould be &s;ecured and delivered up to the prince of Orange, which they
thought might be&s;t be done when William Maine was &s;taff-officer in
waiting. But if Maine &s;hould oppo&s;e it, then my Lord Churchill <HI>was
to pi&s;tol him or &s;tab him;</HI> and it was al&s;o thought advi&s;eable, that my lord Roche&s;ter &s;hould attend the King, in his march towards the prince,
who was thought a fit per&s;on to betray his councils to the prince of
Orange. This confe&s;&s;ion of Sir George Hewit was &s;igned by his own
hand and &s;eal; and tran&s;mitted to the old earl of Peterburgh, that he
might &s;end it to King James, which he did accordingly, as the bi&s;hop
a&s;&s;ured me.</P>
<P>&startq;At another time, the bi&s;hop told me, he &s;aw an original letter of
King James to the afore&s;aid earl of Peterburgh; in which he wrote, that
(being &s;olicited to pardon his &s;on and daughter, the prince and prince&s;s
of Denmark, with others) he could never have a good opinion of them,
or put any confidence in them. The marquis of Halifax, he &s;aid, he
could ea&s;ily forgive. But as for the earl of Danby (who was called in
the letter the old midwi&s;e) he declared, he could never de&s;erve his par|don,
being &s;o treacherous in his nature, and one that loved only him|&s;elf;
and &s;o likewi&s;e for lord Churchill, he &s;aid, his crimes were &s;o black
they could never be forgiven.</P>
<P>&startq;This account I found written in a pocket-book, with my uncle's
own hand; and, till I found the following account in another pocket|book,
<PB N="282" REF="298">
I thought the per&s;on <HI>to be pi&s;toled or &s;tabbed</HI> was Maine. But the
following account, which you will ob&s;erve was dated two years after the
above, makes it quite clear.&endq;</P>
<Q>The &s;ame account extracted by Mr. Malet from another pocket-book, with Sir
Phelim O'Neale's confe&s;&s;ion of his appending an old &s;eal to a forged com|mi&s;&s;ion
from Charles I.</Q>
<P>&startq;Dr. Sheridan, the deprived bi&s;hop of Kilmore, told me, (May 20th
1711) that he was pre&s;ent at the execution of Sir Phelim O'Neale, in
Ireland, for being the chief actor in the Iri&s;h ma&s;&s;acre; and that colonel
Hew&s;on coming toward the ladder, Sir Phelim made his publick ac|knowledgments
to him, in a grateful manner, for the civil treatment he
had met with, during the whole cour&s;e of his impri&s;onment; and only
wi&s;hed, that his life had been taken from him in a more honourable
manner. To this colonel Hew&s;on an&s;wered, that he might &s;ave his life,
if he plea&s;ed, only by declaring, at that pre&s;ent, to the people, that his fir&s;t
taking arms was by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion, under the broad &s;eal of King
Charles the Fir&s;t. But Sir Phelim replied, he would not &s;ave his life by
&s;o ba&s;e a lie, by doing &s;o great an injury to that prince.&mdash;'Tis true, he &s;aid, that he might the better per&s;uade the people to come unto him, he
took off an old &s;eal from an old deed, and clapt it to a commi&s;&s;ion he had
forged; and, &s;o per&s;uaded the people that what he did was by the King's,
authority. But he never really had any commi&s;&s;ion from the King.
This the Bi&s;hop told me, he heard him &s;ay. The &s;aid bi&s;hop likewi&s;e
a&s;&s;ured me, that, being well acquainted with the old earl of Peterburgh,
and often with him, he &s;hewed him, at one of his vi&s;its, Sir George
Hewitt's original confe&s;&s;ion, with his hand and &s;eal to it (which was
afterwards &s;ent to King James in France). In the confe&s;&s;ion, the &s;aid
Sir George Hewitt (who had been made a lord by King William) begged
pardon of God and King James, for his di&s;loyalty and rebellion; and
declared in it, that the night before King James went to Sali&s;bury, the
earl of Roche&s;ter and lord Churchill (now duke of Marlborough), the
bi&s;hop of London, (Stewart, al&s;o, who is now a general officer) (as he
remembers) and him&s;elf, with others, met; at Mr. Hatton Compton's
hou&s;e, in St. Alban's-&s;treet; and there it was debated among them, how
they &s;hould do the be&s;t &s;ervice to the prince of Orange; and, at length,
<PB N="283" REF="299">
it was re&s;olved, that the earl of Roche&s;ter &s;hould attend the King at
Sali&s;bury; but in order to betray all his councils to the prince of
Orange. And the lord Churchill &s;hould endeavour to &s;eize King James's
per&s;on, and carry him off to the Prince. But if he could not do that,
he &s;hould pi&s;tol him, or &s;tab him, when he was in the coach with him.
This the bi&s;hop has prote&s;ted to me (more than once or twice) he &s;aw
written in the confe&s;&s;ion of Sir George Hewitt.</P>

<P>&startq;Soon after the coronation of the prince of Orange, having &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;e
with Sir George Hewit (then newly made a lord) about the late
revolution, he told me, when King James was at Sali&s;bury, if he had
gone to Warmin&s;ter, as he had promi&s;ed, his bu&s;ine&s;s had been done
there. He and captain Cornelius Wood, who was then pre&s;ent, &s;aid Sir
George, he and I had done his bu&s;ine&s;s; for that Wood was to be
exempt of the guard, and I &s;hould have commanded it, and the lord
Churchill would have gone in the King's coach, being in waiting, with
the gold-headed &s;tick. Kirk, Lanier, &s;aid Sir George, and many others
of our party being there, and mo&s;t of the guards, and army, that were
po&s;ted there, right for our purpo&s;e; we were re&s;olved to carry him a
pri&s;oner to the prince of Orange: but if Dumbarton, Sarsfield, or any
other of the papi&s;t officers &s;hould endeavour to re&s;cue him, then, &s;aid
Sir George, little Wood and I, that were on hor&s;eback, were to have
&s;hot him; and if that had mi&s;&s;ed, then lord Churchill, that was pro|vided
with a pocket-pi&s;tol and a dagger, would have &s;hot or &s;tabbed
him in the coach; for there was no other way of &s;aving them&s;elves after
attempting the King. But, as it plea&s;ed God, faith the informant, his
Maje&s;ty's no&s;e very happily fell a bleeding, by which his going to War|min&s;ter

beyond the banks. But he waited there for the return of one he &s;ent to
England, who came that very night. The people of Roterdam, and in
all the &s;ea-ports, began to exclaim and murmur again&s;t the prince, for
lo&s;ing &s;o much time, &s;ince the wind and weather proved &s;o favourable;
for they think they will be received with open arms every where.</P>
<P>On Friday, the tenth, vice-admiral Allemonde returned to Helvoet-&s;tuys,
from the fleet, to take care of the &s;hips remaining; and one cap|tain
Hag to take the command of the &s;hip that is fitting. On Wedne&s;|day,
November the third, two ve&s;&s;els were di&s;patched, with above fifty
thou&s;and of the manife&s;toes of the prince of Orange; one into the We&s;t,

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT the la&s;t camp which King James had at Houn&s;low-heath, which
was in part of July and Augu&s;t, 1688, the earl of Dumbarton, one
of his Maje&s;ty's lieutenant generals, &s;ent for one of the field officers of
every regiment, that were Roman Catholics; and the majors of the re|giments,
where neither the colonels nor lieutenant colonels were Roman
Catholics; and his lord&s;hip told me, and as I pre&s;ume, and heard, he
did all the re&s;t, that his Maje&s;ty had commanded him to &s;end for me, to
give him a li&s;t of all the officers and &s;oldiers in the regiment that were
Roman Catholics; which I was ordered forthwith to do, becau&s;e his
Maje&s;ty expected an account of it from his lord&s;hip. The number of
Roman Catholics was then very incon&s;iderable in our regiment; being
but one lieutenant, a quarter-ma&s;ter, and thirteen troopers.</P>
<P>This order proved of fatal con&s;equence; and was a very great fur|therance
of the bu&s;ine&s;s of our a&s;&s;ociating officers, who, daily and open|ly,
in the camp, aggravated it, with all the rancour and malice imagin|able;
affirming, with vollies of oaths, that it was in order to turn out
all the prote&s;tant officers and &s;oldiers in the army, and to have none but
Roman Catholics in military employments. That, in order thereto, the
Iri&s;h regiments were &s;ent for hither, and the Engli&s;h would be ex|changed,
at &s;everal times, and be reformed in Ireland, that not a pro|te&s;tant
would be left in them.</P>
<P>This was &s;o credited, that it brought over many to their party, as I
have often heard. But being confined by you, in this relation, to &s;end
you nothing but mere matter of fact, to my own knowledge, I mu&s;t
confine my&s;elf more narrowly to what related to the duke of St. Albans'
segiment, in which I &s;erved.</P>
<P>His Grace, both before and at the time of the late great revolution,
being in France, his lieutenant colonel, Thomas Lang&s;ton, having the
command of the regiment, and being deeply concerned in the a&s;&s;ociation,
was very diligent to aggravate the afore&s;aid order, with all the &s;pleen and
rancour that malice could invent, to mo&s;t of the officers and &s;oldiers of
the regiment; and &s;eldom failed expre&s;&s;ing it, under &s;everal heads; the
truth of which, he affirmed, with vollies of oaths, to be to his own
knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="305">
Fir&s;t, That, in a very &s;hort time, the King would not have one pro|te&s;tant
officer or &s;oldier in his whole army; and that he had entered into
a clo&s;e league with France, to have all the prote&s;tants' throats cut, in
England and Scotland.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the prince of Orange had his own taylor, that was a
papi&s;t, and his boy, in cu&s;tody, that were hired by King James and the
earl of Sunderland, father Petre and Sir Nicholas Butler, to poi&s;on the
prince of Orange's wai&s;tcoat, which was di&s;covered by the boy, the very
morning the prince was to have worn it; and, al&s;o, that his ma&s;ter had
confe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the prince of Orange had al&s;o, in his cu&s;tody, the true
mother of the prince of Wales, who had &s;ufficiently proved the &s;ame in
Holland, and would do the like here.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That King James, &s;o &s;oon as his army was modelled to his
purpo&s;e, would &s;et up a ma&s;s in every church in England and Scotland;
and he that was not a thorough papi&s;t would be hanged, quartered, or
burnt.</P>
<P>With the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, he frighted and wheedled &s;everal officers and
&s;oldiers to undertake with him, in his de&s;ign of de&s;erting his Maje&s;ty,
who had made him lieutenant colonel; and, if I have not been mi&s;in|formed,
gave him twice money to pay his debts, under which he was
very unea&s;y. The further to confirm his officers to effect what was de|&s;igned,
he introduced &s;ome of them into the company of the Trea&s;on|club,
as it was commonly called, at the Ro&s;e Tavern, in Covent-Garden,
where they frequently met to con&s;ult with the lord Colche&s;ter, Mr.
Thomas Wharton, colonel Talma&s;h, colonel Godfrey, Mr. William
Jeph&s;on, and many others of their party; and there it was re&s;olved, that
the regiment under the fore&s;aid lieutenant colonel Lang&s;ton's command,
&s;hould de&s;ert entire, as they did, on Sunday,&mdash;November, 1688. The
which was the better effected, becau&s;e the lord Churchill, one of the
lieutenant generals, had ordered tho&s;e regiments to go on the advanced
po&s;t neare&s;t the enemy. The day before we de&s;erted, a private cabal
was held at Sali&s;bury, to agree on the time and manner of doing it. Of
which cabal was the lord Cornbury, colonel of the Royal regiment of dra|goons,
Sir Francis Compton, lieutenant colonel to the duke of Berwick's,
<PB N="290" REF="306">
formerly the earl of Oxford's regiment, lieutenant-colonel Lang&s;ton,
commandant of the duke of St. Albans's regiment, and &s;ome few others
of their tru&s;ty a&s;&s;ociating officers; and, among the re&s;t, it was agreed,
to put their de&s;ign in execution very early next morning; and not to in|tru&s;t
it to lieutenant-colonel Sutherland, who commanded Sir John Fen|wick's
regiment; but to deceive him and all the re&s;t of the officers that
were not in their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Orders were given, at the &s;etting of the watch, being at ten at night,
that the quarterma&s;ters and adjutants of the fore&s;aid three regiments
&s;hould wait for the coming of the po&s;t; by which, they gave out, they
expected marching orders. They, accordingly, did &s;o. About twelve,
the po&s;t came in, and colonel Lang&s;ton al&s;o, who had, according to the
agreement of their late con&s;ult, the counterfeit &s;ham marching orders,
from Mr. Blathwayt, &s;ecretary of war. He called for the bag, before
the officers, and broke it open; and conveyed the orders &s;o cunningly
among&s;t the letters, that none of tho&s;e di&s;covered it, whom he had em|ployed
to help him to look for them. He immediately carried them to
lord Cornbury, the commandant; and, thereupon, orders were pre&s;ently
given out for the regiments to be ready to march, at five o'clock the
next morning, towards the enemy; and, the better to di&s;gui&s;e the mat|ter,
it was given out, that &s;everal other regiments were to come imme|diately
into our quarters, and refre&s;h them&s;elves and follow us. Two
days and a night we marched very hard, not keeping the direct road,
and had very little time allowed us for re&s;t; &s;o fearful were they of
being pur&s;ued. In the march, they were very apprehen&s;ive that the
earl of Fever&s;ham, the duke of Berwick, or Sir John Fenwick might
overtake them, and countermand their march; which, if any of them
had, or any other general officer, that was not of their party, they were
re&s;olved to have &s;hot them, as both lieutenant-colonel Lang&s;ton and
others told me, when they were got into the prince of Orange's quar|ters;
and in order to it, Francis Lang&s;ton, captain-lieutenant to lord
Cornbury's troop of dragoons, and brother to lieutenant colonel Lang&s;ton,
commanded an advanced party of dragoons in the front, and lieutenant|colonel
Thomas Lang&s;ton another in the rear, of the three regiments
that he drew out of his own troop, which he pretended were to keep
the men up together; but were, in truth, to have executed the afore&s;aid
de&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="307">
In our march, the earl of Abingdon, Sir Walter Clerges, and &s;eve|ral
others, came in to Sir Francis Compton, under pretence of being
voluntiers with him, and marched with him to Axmin&s;ter, within &s;ix
miles of the enemy's quarters, where we halted the mo&s;t part of that day;
and, in the evening, it was given out, that they had di&s;covered a de|&s;ign
of the enemy's beating up our quarters. In order to prevent it,
orders were given out for our being in readine&s;s, in the evening, to beat up
theirs; and, accordingly, at the time, the trumpet &s;ounded, and the dra|goon
drums beat to hor&s;e. After which, having &s;at three or four hours
on hor&s;eback, which was chiefly occa&s;ioned by major Littleton of the
duke of Berwick's regiment, and major Clifford of lord Cornbury's re|giment,
who had information given them by &s;ome of their &s;oldiers, that
the pretence of beating up the enemy's quarters was but a &s;ham; and
that it was a de&s;ign to de&s;ert the King; a&s;&s;uring them, that &s;ome of their
fellow-&s;oldiers had been per&s;uading them to go in along with them.
Upon which, the two majors &s;o threatened Sir Francis Compton and the
lord Cornbury, that though they were the two forwarde&s;t officers, for
de&s;erting with the regiments at Sali&s;bury, yet Sir Francis Compton hung
an ar&s;e and &s;neaked away back to Sali&s;bury, with almo&s;t his whole re|giment;
and lord Cornbury &s;tole away with his Lieutenant-colonel
Heyford, who was more re&s;olute, &s;taid, with mo&s;t of his own troop
and &s;ome few others, not exceeding fifty in the whole. The regiment
marched back to Sali&s;bury, under major Clifford, to whom his Ma|je&s;ty
gave the regiment. The whole time of being on hor&s;eback at
Aixmin&s;ter, the duke of St. Albans's regiment was drawn up in a yard
and back &s;treet; and, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the other two regiments,
and being very dark, that they knew nothing of what happened to the
other two regiments.</P>
<P>About ten at night, being the twelfth of November, colonel Lang|&s;ton
came to the head of the regiment, and commanded them to march,
which accordingly they did; and, about twelve, we marched into Ho|niton,
the enemy's quarters; where, in&s;tead of beating them up, we
were received as friends, to the great &s;urprize of tho&s;e that were not
intru&s;ted with the bu&s;ine&s;s. Brigadier-general Talma&s;h commanded in
chief, where his regiment of Scots were drawn up; as al&s;o &s;mall parties
of hor&s;e of the prince of Orange's guarde du corps, Mr. Bentinck's re|giment,

and a party of Gray's dragoons. There were no regular quar|ters
a&s;&s;igned for the de&s;erters that night, but were all ordered to &s;hift
for them&s;elves, and to be on hor&s;eback, near the market-cro&s;s, at eight
next morning. Every officer had time given him, till then, to give his
an&s;wer, whether he was willing to &s;tay with the prince of Orange or not;
and tho&s;e that would, had all manner of encouragement, and promi&s;e
of preferment. Tho&s;e that were not willing, were promi&s;ed leave to
return, with their hor&s;es, arms, and baggage. But, before the time
was expired, their an&s;wer was demanded; and major Ambro&s;e Norton,
lord John Metham, cornet Archibald Clincard, cornet Dennis A&s;h|burnham,
and quarterma&s;ter David Brady, upon their refu&s;al to embrace
the &s;ervice, were all made clo&s;e pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>At the time appointed, the regiment was on hor&s;eback; and the con|fined
officers window being ju&s;t again&s;t them, they could &s;ee what pa&s;t;
which was colonel Lang&s;ton riding through the ranks bareheaded, har|ranguing
and per&s;uading the &s;oldiers to &s;tay with him. But about thirty|three
refu&s;ing to &s;erve, were immediately &s;ent pri&s;oners to the main
guard, which was kept in the market-hou&s;e. So that the number of
&s;oldiers that embraced the &s;ervice, be&s;ides officers, were, of the duke of
Berwick's regiment, twenty-five mounted and two on foot; of the duke
of St. Albans's regiment, one hundred and one mounted, and fifty dra|goons;
in all, one hundred and &s;eventy-eight: a very incon&s;iderable
number to make &s;o much noi&s;e as it did through the kingdom, of three
regiments de&s;erting in a clap. But they, being the fir&s;t that broke the
ice, valued them&s;elves extremely upon it, and reviled the King their
ma&s;ter, who&s;e money and commi&s;&s;ions they went off with in their pockets,
with &s;uch ba&s;e and opprobrious language, as is too indecent to be re|peated.
They were &s;o far from keeping their promi&s;e, of letting the
officers and &s;oldiers return, with their hor&s;es, arms, and baggage, that
they plundered them of all they had, that only excepted which was on
their backs; and with &s;uch inhumanity to their fellow-officers, that they
would not &s;uffer them to change their foul linen for clean, nor let them
have their papers and money, or any thing el&s;e, that was in their port|manteaus.
The forementioned time, that the officers had given them
to con&s;ider, whether they would embrace the &s;ervice or not, gave them
opportunity to inform them&s;elves in what condition the enemy was;
<PB N="293" REF="311">
and the account given them, by &s;everal officers that came over with
the prince, was, that they were between thirteen and fourteen thou&s;and.
But that they were in a very ill condition with their hor&s;es, by rea&s;on of
the great &s;torms at &s;ea; and that the prince of Orange had long ex|pected
his friends in the army, not &s;etting a value upon the country's
coming in to him. That this would be extreme welcome news to his
highne&s;s at Exeter; and that we had exactly nicked the time: for, had
we not come when we did, he was re&s;olved to embark at eight next
morning, and go back, which had been the re&s;ult of three councils of
war. But ju&s;t at the breaking up, it was carried to &s;tay twenty-four
hours longer, to try if any of the army would come in; and &s;o little
hopes had they, till this party came in, that the prince had not &s;o much
as brought his cannon a&s;hore.</P>
<P>The Scotch &s;oldiers of colonel Talma&s;h's regiment, that had the guard
of the duke of St. Albans's regiment, treated them very civilly, and gave
them drink, and drank King James's health to them, on their knees;
and they declared to them their great di&s;like of the &s;ervice they were
engaged in. They &s;aid they were all one King's &s;ubjects, and were very
&s;orry it was their fortune to be in the &s;ervice again&s;t their own King.
They complained of their hard&s;hips and &s;mallne&s;s of their pay; and
they wi&s;hed they were &s;o happy as to be in the King's &s;ervice; and, if
he would but pardon them, it &s;hould not be long before they &s;hould
be with us: that they knew a great many more that were of their
minds, if they were &s;ure of their pardon and of being employed.</P>
<P>Many per&s;ua&s;ive arguments, with great promi&s;es of favour and advance|ment,
were often repeated to the officers, in the time of their confinement,
to induce them to embrace the prince of Orange's &s;ervice; and, among
many others, they a&s;&s;ured them, that the prince's coming into England
was upon the earne&s;t reque&s;t and invitation of the lords &s;piritual and
temporal, the army, navy, and mo&s;t con&s;iderable body of the nation, to
redeem them from &s;lavery and popery. They al&s;o, with many oaths and
vows, a&s;&s;ured major Norton, that a lieutenant-general, under whom he
had &s;erved, was the deepe&s;t in the a&s;&s;ociation, and was the fir&s;t who
propo&s;ed to them the undertaking, and had faithfully promi&s;ed them,
and &s;ent the prince word, that he would be there that night or to-mor|row
morning at farthe&s;t; and not he only, but many others al&s;o, the
<PB N="294" REF="312">
mo&s;t con&s;iderable officers in the army, and with the better part, if not
all, their regiments. The duke of Grafton's foot guards and the old
regiment were certain to come in to them; and that, in a few days, we
&s;hould fee the King the mo&s;t de&s;erted prince that ever lived. Some of
the de&s;erting officers wrote to their friends what progre&s;s they had made,
to encourage them to come in to them; and with the&s;e letters and a pa&s;s,
after three days confinement, they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the officers, and, &s;oon after,
the &s;oldiers. But, within an hour or two, they &s;ent a party of twenty
dragoons after them; upon what de&s;ign the late pri&s;oners know not.
But they followed them a day's journey, and lay but three miles &s;hort
of the officers; only cornet A&s;hburnham and two troopers, going a-foot,
lay &s;hort, and fell into their hands. They took from them their money
and the cornet's cloak, which was all that was left them before, but
ju&s;t the cloaths on their backs. They told them their bu&s;ine&s;s was with
mon&s;ieur, their major, and were very inqui&s;itive after him. But, hearing
no account of him, they returned back.</P>
<P>The&s;e officers and &s;oldiers thus coming away, &s;o much di&s;couraged
many of them, that they &s;neaked away again. His Maje&s;ty and the
earl of Fever&s;ham, his lieutenant-general, received the officers and &s;ol|diers,
that were &s;o trepanned into the enemy's quarters, and returned to
their duty, mo&s;t extraordinary kindly, at Sali&s;bury; and, after the ma|jor
had acquainted his Maje&s;ty with all the di&s;coveries he had made,
by being in the enemy's quarters, which were further confirmed by &s;e|veral
letters which fell into his maje&s;ty's hands, he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed
to make the major lieutenant-colonel of the duke of St. Albans's regi|ment,
and advanced all the re&s;t of the officers, and gave to each two
hundred days pay to equip them&s;elves, and al&s;o five pounds to each
trooper; and orders were given, that the corporals &s;hould be made
quarter-ma&s;ters; and as many of the troopers as were fit, and vacancies,
to be made corporals; and each to have twenty pounds more to re|mount
him and the regiment recruited. The officers and &s;oldiers re|ceived
all this money at Sali&s;bury, without any deduction of poundage:
&s;o affectionately kind was the King to tho&s;e of his army as did their
duty; which, together with many of the regiment that were not able
to get up, by rea&s;on of the hardne&s;s of the march, made up above
eighty &s;oldiers, who were afterwards at Highgate. But, by rea&s;on of
<PB N="295" REF="313">
his Maje&s;ty's going away, that regiment was not recruited; lieutenant
colonel Norton paying con&s;tant attendance on his Maje&s;ty, even to his
la&s;t departure from Roche&s;ter. A corporal or two, and &s;everal trum|peters,
that had marched a-foot from Honiton to Sali&s;bury, followed
him to Roche&s;ter, to tender their &s;ervice there. But, it being then too
late, they returned home to their own country, which was Derby&s;hire,
where they had been rai&s;ed by the earl of Scar&s;dale. Several of the
loyal &s;oldiers were of the Peak. Had not the&s;e things gone on &s;o fa&s;t,
the&s;e &s;oldiers had di&s;covered a &s;py or decoy, in their march from Honi|ton
to Sali&s;bury, which might have been of &s;ervice to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The &s;py treated them very kindly with all that the place afforded,
and in&s;inuated him&s;elf very much into them, under pretence of de&s;iring
to be a trooper with them; and, after having drunk very hard with
them, de&s;ired to know what pay they had. When he was told two &s;hil|lings
and &s;ixpence a day, he &s;aid it was very &s;mall; and that he had
been at Exeter, and was there pre&s;&s;ed five &s;hillings a day to be a trooper,
with two leather pouches full of money, to buy him a better hor&s;e. By
this di&s;cour&s;e, they believed he de&s;igned to decoy them back again; after
which, he &s;lipt from them. But they, acquainting their officers with
it, were ordered by them to make enquiry after him, which they were
very diligent in doing; and, after &s;ome &s;hort time, found him at|tempting
the &s;ame thing on the foot guards, where, by order, he was
confined on the main guard in the &s;e&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e at Sali&s;bury. Notice
whereof being given to lieutenant colonel Lang&s;ton, he went and exa|mined
him there; and, reflecting on what he had &s;aid to the troopers,
and by &s;ome papers found in his pocket, it appeared that he was a cap|tain
or ma&s;ter of &s;hip, a Taunton man, and undoubtedly what he was
&s;u&s;pected to be. Lieutenant-colonel Norton acquainting the King with
it, he ordered one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate to go and examine him
again, and commanded the lieutenant-colonel to attend him; which be|ing
accordingly done, he was convinced that he was one of the prince
of Orange's decoys or &s;pies; and gave him till next morning, about
eight, to confe&s;s or die. But that night, the lord Churchill, who had
been till near twelve in his Maje&s;ty's bedchamber at a council of war,
de&s;erting, with &s;ome others, his Maje&s;ty altering all his mea&s;ures, and
retiring from Sali&s;bury, our &s;py was lo&s;t; or, at lea&s;t, I never heard
<PB N="296" REF="314">
of him. The&s;e are all the remarkable pa&s;&s;ages that I can remember to
have been acted, by the duke of St. Albans's regiment, relating to the
late great REVOLUTION.</P>

<P>The credit to be given to the following anecdote, concerning James
when at Roche&s;ter, mu&s;t depend on the per&s;ons by whom it is related.
It mu&s;t, however, be ob&s;erved, that the language a&s;cribed to the lords
Middleton and Dundee, is extremely &s;uitable to their characters. Middle|ton
was cool, moderate, and &s;en&s;ible; Dundee active, bold, and full of
fire. James him&s;elf owns that Middleton argued, for &s;ome time, again&s;t
his intended flight. The earl of Balcarras mentions, in his Memoirs, an
anecdote not di&s;&s;imilar to the following, given by Carte.</P>

<HEAD>An anecdote from Lord Middleton concerning K. James 2d, when at Roche&s;ter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Memoran|dum Book, vol. xi. 4to, p. 132.</NOTE></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>January 5th, 1739&ndash;40.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>THE earl of Middleton told me, that, when King James
the 2d was at Roche&s;ter, his father, the earl of Dunbarton
and lord Dundee were with him, and the fire wanting to be put to rights
and renewed, the King was &s;o de&s;erted, there was not a &s;ervant of his in the
way. The earl of Middleton, who had gone into the outward room, to &s;ee
for one, told the King there was none in the way but a &s;ervant of his own,
(David Middleton, afterwards &s;teward to the duke of Bedford, whom I
<PB N="300" REF="318">
knew well) and if his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed, he would call him in to mend
the fire. The King de&s;ired it, and David came in. Whil&s;t he was ad|ju&s;ting
the fire, he heard them continue an earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, wherein
they were engaged; and lord Dundee &s;aid, Sir, the que&s;tion is, whether
you &s;hall &s;tay in England or go to France? My opinion is, you &s;hould
&s;tay in England. Make your &s;tand here and &s;ummon your &s;ubjects to
your allegiance. 'Tis true, your army is di&s;banded by your own autho|rity.
But though di&s;banded, not &s;o di&s;per&s;ed, but, if you will give me
your commi&s;&s;ion, I will undertake to get 10,000 of them together; and
march through all England with your &s;tandard at their head, and drive
all the Dutch before you.</P>
<P>The King &s;aid, he believed it might be done; but it would cau&s;e
a civil war; and he would not do &s;o much mi&s;chief to the Engli&s;h na|tion,
which he loved, and would come &s;oon to their &s;en&s;es again. The
earl of Middleton, thereupon, &s;aid, that &s;ince his Maje&s;ty rejected the
party of force, he &s;hould &s;tay in the kingdom at any rate, though the
remote&s;t quarter. For though his going abroad might put them into a
confu&s;ion for &s;ome time, it would not be more than a &s;ix weeks affair;
by which time a new government would be &s;ettled, and he would be
ruined. The King, &s;oon after, &s;tole away for France.</P>
<P>This, David Middleton told the pre&s;ent earl he heard, but went away
without hearing the re&s;t of the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>INnocent the Eleventh po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the See of Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689. January.</NOTE> when the revolution
happened in Great Britain. His aver&s;ion to France threw him into the
arms of the Emperor; and he &s;upported, in &s;ome degree, the cau&s;e of
the allies, with the money of the church. He followed the example
of &s;ome of his predece&s;&s;ors, in endeavouring to unite the Chri&s;tian princes
again&s;t the Turks; and it was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, through his per&s;ua&s;ion,
that John Sobie&s;ki, King of Poland, came to the relief of Vienna;
while he prevailed with the Venetians to join in the alliance, and fur|ni&s;hed
them with con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idies for carrying on the war.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding his zeal for the catholic religion, Innocent was, by no
means a friend to King James. His aver&s;ion to Lewis XIV. had joined
him to the allies, and even connected him with the prince of Orange.
Many catholic princes followed the example of the father of the church.
The Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague ordered ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid pub|lickly
in his chapel for the &s;ucce&s;s of the prince's expedition. The
emperor e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e with all his influence, at Rome; and he
him&s;elf had the addre&s;s to per&s;uade the Pope, that the intere&s;t of the
Roman Catholics, and the re&s;toration of their religion in Britain, were
connected with the &s;ucce&s;s of his enterprize.</P>

<HEAD>&startq;An anecdote from Prince Vaudemont,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte's Me|morandum book, mark|ed vol. xi. 4to. p. 33.</NOTE> concerning the Prince of Orange's
engagement with the Pope.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>&startq;P. Vaudemont was an intimate friend of the prince of Orange, and
had all his confidence; when the league of Aug&s;burg was on foot,
and P. O. entertained thoughts of mounting the throne of England, he
<PB N="302" REF="320">
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pre-engage the Pope, Emperor, and King of
Spain to favour his enterprize upon England. He, therefore, told P.
Vaudemont, that the Pope and the Roman Catholic princes were in the
wrong to expect any thing from K. James, in favour of the Romi&s;h
faith: that his being declared of that religion, made every body jealous
of the lea&s;t and mo&s;t indifferent &s;tep he took; and it was, therefore,
impracticable for him to do them any &s;ervice; for the whole nation
would oppo&s;e it, as tending to de&s;troy the church of England; whereas
him&s;elf, being a prote&s;tant, might take any &s;tep whatever, and &s;erve
them effectually, without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion; and, in ca&s;e they would
favour and promote his attempt upon England, he would undertake to
procure a toleration for the Roman Catholics. P. Vaudemont went to
Rome; and with this argument, engaged the Pope, the Emperor, and
the King of Spain, to come into the P. of Orange's &s;cheme, and favour
his attempt. The fir&s;t thing, therefore, attempted by the P. of Orange,
after the revolution, was a toleration which he carried for the di&s;&s;enters;
and, though not for the Roman Catholics, yet all his reign he gave them
a connivance equivalent to a toleration.</P>
<P>This P. Vaudemont told general Dillon, who told it to ME, and to
many others, as the chevalier Gla&s;cock, abb&eacute; Dunne, &amp;c.&endq;</P>
<P>James was a &s;tranger to the intrigues formed again&s;t him at the
court of Rome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE> He was too devout a &s;on of the church, to &s;uppo&s;e
that the holy father would con&s;pire with his enemies, to deprive him of
his throne. His ignorance continued, after his flight from England;
and when he was preparing for his expedition into Ireland, he &s;ent colonel
Porter, a gentleman of his bedchamber, as his envoy extraordinary to
Innocent the Eleventh. The &s;ub&s;tance of his in&s;tructions, which were
dated at St. Germains, the 4th of February, 1689, is here &s;ubjoined.</P>
<P>&startq;PORTER was required to te&s;tify to the Pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> James's profe&s;&s;ion of,
and attachment to, the catholic faith: to repre&s;ent that the prote&s;|tant
princes were alarmed at its progre&s;s upon his acce&s;&s;ion: that they
are united in a league to &s;top that progre&s;s, and had engaged catholic
princes to join them. He was de&s;ired to be&s;eech his Holine&s;s to bring
about a peace between the Emperor and his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty: to
<PB N="303" REF="321">
repre&s;ent the advantages of their reconciliation to James, and to the ca|tholic
religion: that James was dethroned on account of his religion:
that the pre&s;ent war is a religious war; witne&s;s the per&s;ecution of R. Ca|tholics,
and the profanation and de&s;truction of their churches in Eng|land.
Porter was directed to cultivate the friend&s;hip of certain car|dinals.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Waldgrave was created lord Waldgrave by James 2d on
the 20th January, 1686. He married the lady Henrietta, natural
daughter of that prince, by Mrs. Arabella Churchill, Si&s;ter to John
duke of Marlborough. He retired into France, on the acce&s;&s;ion of Wil|liam
III.; and until his death, which happened in the latter end of this
year, was firmly attached to the fortune of his father-in-law. He lived
with the Queen at St. Germains, and carried on the negociations of
James's mini&s;ters with Ver&s;ailles and Rome.</P>

England, which we hope they are not in a condition to &s;end. However
it is mo&s;t certain, that &s;ince all the nobility at that mock-court have ta|ken
the names of regiments, they will get men enough, and if they be
not prevented they will come hither.&endq;</P>
<P>Melfort refers lord Waldgrave to a memorial he had pre&s;ented to the
French amba&s;&s;ador on this &s;ubject. He de&s;ires him to communicate the
&s;tate of James's affairs to his foreign mini&s;ters, e&s;pecially the cardinal
duke, that he might let the Pope know the truth of all, and convince
him, that he is impo&s;ed on by the faction of Spain.</P>

the long run, I doubt that will hardly be thought for his &s;ervice. I mu&s;t
not pre&s;s you to tell me any thing of this matter. But, if you could, you
would much oblige me.&endq;</P>
<P>Lewis the XlVth is &s;uppo&s;ed to have behaved with genero&s;ity to
James in his di&s;tre&s;s, and though he only meant in the beginning to fo|ment
divi&s;ions in Britain and make Charles and James the in&s;truments of
his ambitious de&s;igns, it is probable, that towards the end of his life, he
was &s;incerely attached to the exiled family, and de&s;irous of replacing them
again on the throne. It does not even appear that he ever &s;tipulated with
James, for any return for the great expences which he incurred in the
cau&s;e of that prince, unwilling perhaps, to add to his misfortunes by
doubting his gratitude.</P>
<P>But frequent mortifications are unavoidable in every &s;tate of depend|ence.
Though James was not forced to purcha&s;e the friend&s;hip of his
benefactor with a ce&s;&s;ion of any part of his dominions, as has been
groundle&s;sly &s;uppo&s;ed, he was obliged to grant extraordinary privileges to
the French &s;ubjects, and to di&s;tingui&s;h them by peculiar marks of his
favour. The count D'Avaux, who followed him to Ireland as amba&s;|&s;ador
from Lewis, took the lead in all his councils. He &s;eemed rather
to dictate than to advi&s;e; and James, &s;crupulou&s;ly attentive to his com|mands,
endeavoured, in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner, to ju&s;tify his con|duct,
as appears from his an&s;wer to a memorial pre&s;ented to him by that
mini&s;ter.</P>

<P>&startq;HIS Maje&s;ty being very &s;en&s;ible of the friendly and generous offices
of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, thinks he cannot give too &s;trong proofs
of the gratitude he endeavours to &s;hew on all occa&s;ions, and particularly
in treating his amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary in a more di&s;tingui&s;hed manner
than any amba&s;&s;ador ever was, giving him chearfully &s;uch a reception,
<PB N="305" REF="323">
as may &s;ufficiently convince the world of his e&s;teem for the King his
ma&s;ter, care&s;&s;ing him always as his intimate friend, and con&s;idering him
as his mo&s;t faithful councillor in his mo&s;t &s;ecret affairs, which he ge|nerally
communicated to him before he &s;poke of them to the duke of
Tyrconnel or to the earl of Melfort.</P>
<P>&startq;His Maje&s;ty, upon his arrival in his kingdom of Ireland, communi|cated
to the &s;aid amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary, the pain, that the di&s;order in
which he found the kingdom gave him; and in order to redre&s;s them,
having cho&s;en a cabinet-council, the &s;aid amba&s;&s;ador was the fir&s;t mem|ber
of it, and was pre&s;ent at all the meetings. So that to this moment
he has had opportunities of giving his advice, which has been almo&s;t
generally followed. His Maje&s;ty, therefore, cannot comprehend what
rea&s;on the &s;aid amba&s;&s;ador had to pre&s;ent his memorial of the fourth of
June; in which he complains chiefly, that he hath made many pre&s;&s;ing
in&s;tances for applying a &s;peedy remedy to the dangers which threat|ened,
&amp;c. not doubting but his Maje&s;ty con&s;idered the remedies which
might be applied again&s;t the&s;e threatening calamities in his &s;ecret cabinet|council;
and as he is a &s;tranger to what pa&s;&s;es there, he cannot &s;ee but
with &s;urprize, that nothing is done which might contribute to the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment
of his Maje&s;ty's affairs, and that even the &s;ecurity of his
per&s;on is neglected.</P>
<P>&startq;In an&s;wer to this, James replied, that he was the fir&s;t to di&s;cover the&s;e
di&s;orders. That &s;ince he came to the kingdom, he con&s;idered by him|&s;elf
and in his cabinet-council, the mo&s;t effectual means of preventing
them. That the amba&s;&s;ador was always pre&s;ent in council, where he
either advi&s;ed or con&s;ented to whatever pa&s;&s;ed, and could atte&s;t, that all
the orders which were given were as punctually executed as the pre&s;ent
circum&s;tances would permit, the King having always placed them in the
hands of tho&s;e who were nominated by the amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;aid amba&s;&s;ador alledges in his memorial, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary
to &s;peak of what is pa&s;t, as there is no time to apply a remedy. But, as
there is &s;till time to puni&s;h tho&s;e who are guilty of the faults or neglects
that have been committed, his Maje&s;ty not being able to gue&s;s what the
amba&s;&s;ador complains of, thinks it proper that he &s;hould explain him&s;elf
more clearly.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="324">
&startq;D'Avaux &s;aid in his memorial, that there were clear and circum&s;tantial
accounts from different quarters, that there were 10,000 prote&s;tants in
Dublin, who had arms, and who had written to the prince of Orange
for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &amp;c. James an&s;wers, that he was the fir&s;t who gave this
intelligence, and that d'Avaux would never have heard of it unle&s;s (he)
James had told it to him when he a&s;ked his advice, which he did re|peatedly,
not only in council, but al&s;o at a private meeting, at which the
marquis de Ro&s;en was pre&s;ent. It was then determined to di&s;arm the
prote&s;tants, and to deliver up their arms and hor&s;es to the marquis de
Ro&s;en in the pre&s;ence of the amba&s;&s;ador. But on the evening before this
de&s;ign was to be put in execution, James had certain intelligence, that
the pre&s;byterians had &s;ent letters to the prince of Orange. The intended
bearer of the&s;e letters who was his informer, knew their ring-leaders, who
might be all &s;eized in a little time. James, who would never change
what was once determined in council without the con&s;ent of the amba&s;&s;a|dor,
con&s;ulted him on the &s;ubject of this information, in the pre&s;ence of
the marquis de Ro&s;en. They were both of opinion it was proper to delay
the execution of their de&s;ign, until as many as po&s;&s;ible of the guilty could
be &s;eized. James, &s;eeing that it would take up too much time to di&s;|cover
them all, &s;eized at the end of five or &s;ix days as many as were known
to be guilty; and as nece&s;&s;ity obliged him to &s;end the troops employed
in the &s;earch again&s;t the rebels of Inni&s;killin, he con&s;ulted the amba&s;&s;ador
about the means of continuing the &s;earch in de Ro&s;en's ab&s;ence: it was
agreed to employ a lieutenant general, the vi&s;count de Mont-Ca&s;hel, on
that &s;ervice, and the nece&s;&s;ary orders were then given to him, though to
little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;aid amba&s;&s;ador complains that his Maje&s;ty was informed, that
the prote&s;tants had carried already and continued to carry away the effects
of the rebels, &amp;c. which &s;hould have been confi&s;cated for his Maje&s;ty's
u&s;e, and knew that the &s;heriffs and others employed to &s;earch for the&s;e
effects, had allowed them to be conveyed away, for the &s;ake of &s;ome
pre&s;ents made to them&s;elves. He alledges that this is a thing of &s;o much
con&s;equence to his Maje&s;ty's intere&s;ts, that he humbly, entreated him
more than once, to arrange it in a proper manner, and had even pro|po&s;ed
the means of doing &s;o, but that nothing had been done as yet to
prevent this robbery.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="325">
&startq;It is true, his Maje&s;ty has heard, that the effects, not of rebels, but
of &s;uch prote&s;tants as endeavoured to go over to England had been tran&s;|ported
to that country, and that that happened by the connivance
of &s;ome officers of the revenue, who are prote&s;tants and are &s;ettled in &s;ea|port
towns. His Maje&s;ty ordered them in&s;tantly to be di&s;charged from
their employments, although there had been nothing proved again&s;t them,
nor any formal accu&s;ation given in of their crime; and his orders had
been executed &s;o punctually by the commi&s;&s;ioners of his revenue, on
whom the&s;e officers depend, that when the amba&s;&s;ador gave in his me|morial
there remained but two or three of them in the kingdom. The&s;e
three were men of fidelity well known to the commi&s;&s;ioners. All this
con&s;idered, his Maje&s;ty cannot conceive what the amba&s;&s;ador means by
this article in his memorial.</P>
<P>&startq;As the. amba&s;&s;ador mentions the e&s;tates of rebels, from which his
Maje&s;ty might draw, by legal means, con&s;iderable &s;ums, which he might
employ in paying his troops; and as he ob&s;erves, with pain, that the mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian King will be di&s;&s;atisfied when he learns, that his Maje&s;ty does
not avail him&s;elf of the &s;uccours which he has in his hands, and which
are as con&s;iderable as they are nece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent pre&s;&s;ing exigencies of
his affairs; his Maje&s;ty would have the amba&s;&s;ador know, that according
to the laws of the country, the&s;e confi&s;cations cannot be lawfully touched
by him or by his officers, but after a &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed by the ordinary
judges, or an act of parliament.&endq; James gives rea&s;ons why neither the
one nor the other could be done at this time, and thence concludes,
&startq;that the amba&s;&s;ador has been ill informed, when he believed that his
Maje&s;ty could have, before now, taken the&s;e confi&s;cations in a lawful
manner.&endq; James then acquaints D'Avaux, with the orders which he had
given to the &s;heriffs and to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms, whom he had
appointed as commi&s;&s;aries in the different counties in the kingdom, to
make up an exact inventory of the e&s;tates, not only of rebels, but al&s;o of
ab&s;entees; &startq;and that it was not in his power to do more until he could
take the&s;e e&s;tates in a lawful manner; being naturally aver&s;e to do any
thing contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of his kingdom, that would give
a handle to his enemies to ju&s;tify their accu&s;ations of his arbitrary con|duct,
<PB N="308" REF="326">
about which they made &s;o much noi&s;e In his other kingdoms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and
he does not think it con&s;i&s;tent with ordinary prudence in the pre&s;ent
&s;tate of his affairs.</P>
<P>&startq;It is clearly proved by what hath been &s;aid above, that his Maje&s;ty
hath neglected nothing which he could lawfully do for pre&s;erving the&s;e
e&s;tates, and he does not recollect to have received any advice from the
amba&s;&s;ador on this &s;ubject, unle&s;s it was to appoint the Sieur Tuffereau,
commi&s;&s;ary general for the&s;e e&s;tates; as if he alone, being a &s;tranger to
the language and cu&s;toms of the country, had been &s;ufficient for an
office, which &s;o many hundreds find a difficulty in executing.&endq; James
a&s;&s;ures D'Avaux, that the value of the&s;e e&s;tates had been exaggerated.
That they con&s;i&s;ted entirely of cows, &s;heep, and &s;ome corn, for which
there were no purcha&s;ers. &startq;The&s;e things being con&s;idered, his Maje&s;ty,
imagines, that the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, who has too good a judgment
not to know what &s;hould be done on the&s;e occa&s;ions, will be per&s;uaded
that he avails him&s;elf of all the means in his hands, and will not blame
his actions, when he has con&s;idered them with that friend&s;hip and bene|volence
which he has &s;o generou&s;ly &s;hown upon all occa&s;ions.&endq;</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this memorial regards military operations, which D'Avaux
had condemned, and James endeavours to ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>James's troops in Ireland had neither arms nor pay<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>There is a return of arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol.

You mu&s;t endeavour with all &s;peed to procure to us &s;ix thou&s;and foot

<P>The in&s;tructions to which the King refers in the preceding paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 33.</NOTE> con|tain
very particular directions. Lord Dover was to embark at Kin&s;ale,
to wait on the queen immediately upon his arrival, and to obey her in|&s;tructions.
He was to inform Lewis of the &s;tate of Ireland, and of the
difficulties which James had to overcome. &startq;The rea&s;ons of delay
you have in the journal of this date, of which you are to make u&s;e, as
being the matter of fact which has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince our arrival here<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See above, page 216.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&startq;The condition and nature of the arms come la&s;t from France, you
are to inform of, but &s;o, that no offence may be taken by Mr. de
Louvois if he &s;ent them, nor by any others of the mini&s;ters con|cerned.&endq;</P>
<P>James proceeds to mention the rea&s;ons, with which lord Dover was
to endeavour to per&s;uade Lewis to &s;end him a fleet and troops, in order
to invade England and make a diver&s;ion in Scotland. He marks the
quantity of arms, &s;tores, amunition, &amp;c. which he wanted; &s;ets forth his
need of money and the advantage of &s;ending him an immediate &s;upply, and
the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending it, on account of the lo&s;s which his Maje&s;ty mu&s;t
unavoidably &s;u&s;tain from the circulation of coppertickets, which was only
a temporary expedient to &s;atisfy his creditors, by &s;ome acknowledgement
of the debt he owed them.</P>
<P>He de&s;ires lord Dover &startq;to make his principal application to the mar|quis
de Louvois, and to an&s;wer every thing that may be objected
again&s;t us or any thing we have done, e&s;pecially in our behaviour to
the French officers our deare&s;t brother the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King &s;ent
us, and all others of that nature, of which you have memorials and li&s;ts

He then de&s;ires lord Dover to inform Lewis of his indulgence to the
French &s;ubjects in the articles of trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t.</NOTE> particularly in exporting wool and
importing wine.</P>
<P>&startq;You are to endeavour with all the &s;oftne&s;s imaginable to have our
deare&s;t brother recall the marquis de Ro&s;en, as one, after having done
what he did at Londonderry, incapable to &s;erve us u&s;efully; you are to
inform, if need be, of his contemning our protections, by ordering to
drive in and &s;tarve not only tho&s;e who lived peaceably at home, but
likewi&s;e tho&s;e who were protected by us; &s;o that no promi&s;es will be
believed from him, nor indeed from our officers, till the truth of this
affair be known by the rebels. At Inni&s;killin they are become more
numerous by much, every body running there for &s;helter from &s;o un|ju&s;t
a violence. You &s;hall &s;hew how he required to be recalled, if this
his project was not followed, and how he offered him&s;elf garant of the
treaty with the town, and that if any violation of it happened he would
put him&s;elf on their &s;ide; the which procedure of his there was no|thing
but the con&s;ideration of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty could have
made us &s;uffer from him; and therefore, &s;ince we will not vindicate our

<P>HIS Maje&s;ty has laid the affairs this expre&s;s comes for &s;o fully before
you, that it is but little I have to add to it. Some time ago the
French amba&s;&s;ador gave a memorial to the King, of things that the King
his ma&s;ter advi&s;ed the King to do; and among&s;t other things this was one,
to cea&s;e the &s;iege of Derry if there was no likelihood of taking it. The&s;e
things the King was &s;till inclined to, and therefore, did &s;till deliberate
how to execute them, and &s;o, thought all were of opinion the &s;iege was to
be cea&s;ed, yet none was &s;o much of that mind, as that it was fit to be
done then, nor indeed before we had news that the Engli&s;h were ju&s;t
<PB N="313" REF="331">
landing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> and then all with one con&s;ent were of the &s;ame mind. You mu&s;t
know that I told you this, becau&s;e the French amba&s;&s;ador and mon&s;ieur
de Ro&s;en are &s;till laying all the blame on the King, for not following
their advice as they &s;ay, whil&s;t nothing in the world is more true, than
that he &s;till followed all that was practicable of it; and that for Ro&s;en he
never would give any, though the King has a&s;ked it many and many a
time from him. Nor had the King the power to make him take the
command of Derry on him, nor the ordering of any thing of that &s;iege
by no order he could &s;end to him, as you will &s;ee by the King's letters
to him and his in return, which I &s;end you the copies of for your in|formation.</P>
<P>He has done the King much harm. For if he had let the Prote&s;tants
alone who were protected, their party at Inni&s;killin had not been &s;o &s;trong
as it now is. But for what's pa&s;t it is in vain to talk to you of it, nor
to tell you the blame thrown on the two Hamiltons, or the diffidence the
natives have of them. All we mu&s;t look to now, is what's to come, and
that depends on what the King of France will do. Let him &s;end us quickly
what he has to &s;end us, e&s;pecially men and arms, for the&s;e two would
&s;erve us. Send as many arms as po&s;&s;ibly you can, and believe there is
no want of raw men to be found here, if we had but &s;ome old troops to
&s;how them how to do well. Ha&s;te is all, and the King is &s;o pre&s;&s;ing to
di&s;patch this, that I have not time to &s;ay the thou&s;andth part of what I
would &s;ay if I had time. The journal as it is I have &s;ent to you, and by
the next you &s;hall have it more perfect.</P>
<P>I have time to add no more, but wonder we hear nothing from you
&s;ince Porter came. We think there is &s;ome fault. But when we con|&s;ider
that the ways may be &s;topt, we mu&s;t have patience. The King was
never better in his health. God &s;end him to be long &s;o I am, with
all my heart,</P>

hope &s;hortly to &s;ee here, and by him be informed of the &s;uccours we ex|pect
thence, which for their own intere&s;t as well as ours ought to be
ha&s;tened, that we may &s;oon quench the flame which Schomberg's landing
in this kingdom hath kindled here. For although God has ble&s;&s;ed our
councils and endeavours already beyond our expectation, and we find
them &s;o well &s;econded by our loyal &s;ubjects here, that we are per&s;uaded
we &s;hall hinder its &s;preading out of that corner of the North where it is
now fixed; yet time is precious, and it may be conjectured out of Schom|berg's
conduct, that his in&s;tructions were either to take a pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the kingdom, (of which he had &s;ome hopes at his arrival,) or to pro|tract
the war in it, and keep it out of England by that means, which mu&s;t
in the &s;equel be the ruin of this kingdom too; for it being already
impoveri&s;hed, it will by a la&s;ting war with two armies in the bowels of
it be quite con&s;umed. Wherefore it is of great con&s;equence that this
war be &s;peedily ended, as well for the pre&s;ervation of this kingdom as the
tran&s;portation of it into England, whil&s;t our friends there are in heart.
With that intention having gathered together as good an army as ever
was &s;een here, and as well provided as po&s;&s;ible, finding in both officers
and &s;oldiers a re&s;olution for God, our&s;elves, and their country, and an
earne&s;t de&s;ire to be brought to the enemy; on the 6th of September, we
came with them within three miles of Dundalk, where Schomberg lies
encamped. Since which time we have often offered him occa&s;ions of
battle. We have omitted nothing that might provoke him to it by ex|cur&s;ions
of parties to his out gaurds, by forraging near his camp, and con|&s;uming
with &s;ire what we could not tran&s;port; yet he continues within
<PB N="315" REF="333">
his trenches without accepting a battle or even a fair &s;kirmi&s;h, although his
parties have been often much &s;uperior in number to ours. Thus much,
that you may under&s;tand our pre&s;ent condition, which is &s;uch as we may
hope to hold out much longer than till November, the time de&s;igned for
our &s;uccours, which you may &s;o repre&s;ent, as not to &s;lacken the mini&s;ters
of that court in di&s;patching them as if they were not nece&s;&s;ary; but
to ha&s;ten them, by &s;hewing them how ea&s;y it is to cha&s;e Schomberg out
of this country, which would open a door for our return to England;
and by this, break that formidable league again&s;t France, and lay the

opinion he had of the great con&s;equence of pre&s;erving Ireland, and of the
danger, if it were not &s;uccoured. But that the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of their
affairs was &s;uch, that they could not &s;pare any men, till the end of Octo|ber;
and that they had not arms or ammunition ready, their magazines
being exhau&s;ted, what was &s;ent into Ireland already being the very remnants;
&s;o that it would require time to get together any quantity. That in
ca&s;e Mon&s;. de Schomberg &s;hould land, he hoped the King would be
able to defend him&s;elf, till the beginning of November; and that then he
&s;hould not want a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I cannot &s;ee how they could refu&s;e 6000
men, con&s;idering the good po&s;ture of their affairs; but much le&s;s, why
they refu&s;e a &s;mall quantity of arms. My lord Dover having begged,
that, if they could not &s;end the quantity de&s;ired, they &s;hould at lea&s;t &s;end
what they had ready, every thou&s;and arms being a thou&s;and men to the
King. They had a warm di&s;pute about the lies, that were written by
many of the French in Ireland; Lord Dover demon&s;trating plainly the
impo&s;&s;ibility of doing better, con&s;idering the de&s;olation of the country;
and that many of the employments, which were &s;aid to be ill-executed,
as relating to the money, commi&s;&s;aries for the army, &amp;c. were executed
by Frenchmen. Mon&s;. de Louvois did an&s;wer, that he was &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="317" REF="335">
the difficulties in a country de&s;troyed by civil war, and where the me|thod
of arms and &s;ieges being new, few had any experience in their em|ployments.
But that he was convinced, that no indu&s;try was u&s;ed to
obviate the&s;e difficulties. That, when&s;oever a cart was not to be found
with hor&s;es, the artillery or baggage &s;tood for want of indu&s;try to get
cows or oxen. Then when any the lea&s;t &s;crew was broke of any of the
arms, there was no care to have a &s;mith to mend them. That the
French, who had executed their employments ill, as I think, e&s;pecially
&s;ome of the commi&s;&s;aries were &s;aid to have done, were not recom|mended
from hence, and it was the fault of tho&s;e who admitted them, as
I remember, lord Dover did &s;ay, that they were recommended by Mon&s;.
D'Avaux. The King of France has been &s;ince with the Queen; and
has &s;aid the &s;ame as Mon&s;. de Louvois, as to the time of &s;ending into
Ireland. But he &s;eemed more ready to believe my lord Dover, con|cerning
the management of affairs there. They are very ready to recal
Rozen. But I doubt much, whether they are not &s;orry Lau&s;un is &s;ent
in his place; it being only yielded to (as I believe) becau&s;e the King has
writ &s;o earne&s;tly for him, and that many, who do not love him, are
glad to &s;end him out of the way. I have been told, by tho&s;e who are
mo&s;t affectionate to the King's &s;ervice, that whenever he has had power,
he has been &s;o in&s;upportably imperious and haughty, that it was impo&s;|&s;ible
to live with him; and that, &s;ince he was &s;o with his own ma&s;ter, it
is to be feared he will be wor&s;e when he finds him&s;elf and the &s;uccours
he commands nece&s;&s;ary. Be&s;ides, it is &s;o long &s;ince he has been in an
army, that he mu&s;t have forgot much of the method of war; and cer|tainly
his impri&s;onment and life &s;ince have taken away that vigour and
activity, nece&s;&s;ary to command a raw army. He has &s;hewed &s;o much ill-humour
about this matter, that I have almo&s;t fallen out with him about
it. The fir&s;t two or three days, after lord Dover's arrival, he told us,
that he would not go, unle&s;s he were made a duke. When he begun
to be cool enough to con&s;ider, that &s;uch a capitulation would &s;end him
again to pri&s;on, he &s;aid he would go; but told me, particularly, that, if
there were a man, to whom he wi&s;hed the greate&s;t plague he could in|vent,
it &s;hould be to be in his circum&s;tances, and to be &s;ent into Ireland.
That he was grown old, and de&s;ired quiet; and, in&s;tead of that, un|dertook
a de&s;perate bu&s;ine&s;s; only fit for &s;omebody who had neither re|putation,
nor intere&s;t, nor quiet, nor any thing el&s;e to lo&s;e. I believe no
<PB N="318" REF="336">
general in France but would have been ambitious to re&s;tore the King,
and to venture their lives in &s;uch a cau&s;e. He intends to &s;tay to go with
the men, becau&s;e he will take better care to have every thing nece&s;&s;ary.
He is very ill with Mon&s;. de Louvois. But I hope the latter is &s;o good
a &s;ervant to his ma&s;ter, that he will not oppo&s;e any thing out of a private
pique. I was glad to find, that lord Dover was &s;o well received at this
court, becau&s;e Mon&s;. D'Avaux had writ, that, after the &s;ea-&s;ight, he
&s;eemed to be &s;orry for the victory, and turned it into ridicule; &s;o that
the King of France took notice of it to the Queen, and the mini&s;ters to
me. But he has wrote &s;ince, in &s;uch a manner, as lord Dover has been
received with great kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>The bills of exchange, drawn upon me, were taken at Che&s;ter, as I
perceive, by a letter I have had from James Grimes, in which he de&s;ires
me to find &s;ome other way to &s;end money; and that he thinks the ordi|nary
way of returning by merchants dangerous. I have already informed
your lord&s;hip, that I have &s;poke to Mon&s;. de Croi&s;&s;y, who told me he
had received a letter from your lord&s;hip, on that &s;ubject; and had ac|cordingly
&s;poke to the King of France, who an&s;wered, that he had al|ready
given 2000 pi&s;toles, which he believed had not been &s;pent as was
de&s;igned, &s;ince they were for printing papers, and &s;ending intelligence
into Ireland; and he was informed by Mon&s;. D'Avaux, that the King
had very little intelligence from his friends in England.</P>
<P>I have &s;poke &s;ince, but found le&s;s hope &s;ince the war is likely to be
carried into Ireland. Whereas, if the war could have been carried into
England, it would have been of &s;uch invincible nece&s;&s;ity, that it mu&s;t
have been madne&s;s to have refu&s;ed it. I have al&s;o informed your lord|&s;hip,
that I went to Mon&s; de Metz Garde du Tre&s;or Royal; and told
him, that he knew very well, that I had received 50,000 livres for the
month the King was here. That I had not any notice from the King,
at his departure, that I was not to receive the whole &s;um; and, there|fore,
I believed, he expected I &s;hould do it, and return into Ireland what
was above the Queen's proportion. He told me, that the comptroller
general had ordered him to pay me only 21,000 livres a month; and
that the King had left his orders concerning the re&s;t. I a&s;ked him, whe|ther
the re&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through his hands, and to whom he paid it, to be
returned into Ireland. But could not get any light, by his an&s;wer. Upon
<PB N="319" REF="337">
which, I de&s;ired Mon&s;. de Lau&s;un to &s;peak with the comptroller general,
who told him the King had left his orders, and would not give him any
account.</P>
<P>While James was endeavouring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> in vain, to force Schomberg to fight,
he &s;ent Lord Melfort to France, to enquire into the &s;ucce&s;s of lord Do|ver's
negociations, and to convince Lewis the XIV. and his mini&s;ters of
the facility and advantage of making a diver&s;ion in England.&mdash;Melfort

<DIV3>
<OPENER>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty,</OPENER>
<P>SINCE my la&s;t to your Maje&s;ty, we have had many accounts of &s;uc|ce&s;s
you have had; and we have only wanted the confirmation of
&s;o good news, to give us a joy we have now been long &s;trangers to.
God Almighty grant, that it be true, and your Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t ju&s;t and
righteous cau&s;e may pro&s;per, to the ruin of your enemies.</P>
<P>After I had given my fir&s;t accounts here to the mini&s;ters and to the
King him&s;elf, and touched on &s;ome things I had found your Maje&s;ty
mo&s;t blamed for, I was not willing to pre&s;s any farther, till I &s;hould,
learn how what I had &s;aid reli&s;hed; and, for this end, I employed my
friends at court to get me notice of the different &s;entiments. I was not
long of finding, that the King was &s;atisfied, and &s;aw, that before he had
not been rightly informed, neither by D'Avaux nor lord Dover, of the
<PB N="320" REF="338">
&s;tate of Ireland, either before your Maje&s;ty came to it or &s;ince; and
that, not finding things &s;o de&s;perate, he begun to be of the opinion,
that the help he gave would not be lo&s;t. The mini&s;ters pretended to be
&s;o well &s;atisfied with the an&s;wers I had given to what your Maje&s;ty was
accu&s;ed of, and what was laid to my charge, that every one told me what
they had been informed of, and &s;o gave me the occa&s;ion to vindicate all;
a matter not hard to do, for one &s;o much conver&s;ant in the whole matter.
On the main, I found the calumnies to come from the amba&s;&s;ador, Ro|&s;en,
and &s;ome of the French officers, on the one hand; and from a knot
of Iri&s;h on the other, who re&s;ide here at Paris. As for the French, all
I could do was, to an&s;wer them. I did it fully, in ways not worthy
troubling your Maje&s;ty with. But as for the Iri&s;h, I made it my bu&s;i|ne&s;s
to find out their malice, as well as the ways they took to execute it.
I &s;oon found, that the fountain of this here was one bi&s;hop Malone, who,
&s;ome time ago, being pre&s;&s;ed to go to Ireland, had refu&s;ed, and being
put to it, declared, that he was entru&s;ted at the court of France by
duke Tyrconnel, and for the clergy and nobility of Ireland, and con&s;e|quently
could not go. This he drew up in a paper, and was re&s;olved to
have pre&s;ented it to the Queen. But &s;ome of his countrymen, more wi&s;e
than he, it &s;eems, prevented it. This I had from one of that kingdom,
who &s;aw the paper.</P>
<P>This man, pretending &s;o odd an amba&s;&s;ade, has a &s;ecret corre&s;pond|ence
and acce&s;s to the mini&s;ters, as I am informed, to whom he &s;hews
letters of corre&s;pondence from Ireland of a mo&s;t abominable &s;train; e&s;pe|cially
three (after which I now hunt), wherein the great things done in
that kingdom before your Maje&s;ty's coming there are fully &s;et out; and
how you had, by the advice of ill councillors, ruined all the good order
you found in it, and hindered duke Tyrconnel's de&s;igns. I was almo&s;t
de&s;pairing to find any of the&s;e &s;o true, as that I might build upon them,
when the Queen was plea&s;ed to tell me, that &s;he had got the la&s;t of them
from that bi&s;hop him&s;elf, a good luck I could not hope for. I begged
it; and, though &s;he could not give me the original, till &s;he had
&s;poken to the bi&s;hop, yet &s;he has promi&s;ed me a copy of it, by which
I &s;hall more fully know what is &s;aid, and be better able to vindicate your
Maje&s;ty here, and be able to find out the per&s;on from whom it was, &s;ent;
which I think is of the la&s;t importance to your Maje&s;ty's honour, to have
<PB N="321" REF="339">
him puni&s;hed, with all the rigour the laws civil or military, if an offi|cer,
will allow of; and I mu&s;t conjure your Maje&s;ty, though I know it
needle&s;s in this matter, where your honour and reputation in this coun|try
is concerned, not to have compa&s;&s;ion on him, nor have regard either
to his relations or any thing el&s;e; but have him puni&s;hed &s;o, as the world
may &s;ee he was a calumniator of his King: a crime merits more deaths
than that ill man has hairs. For it is by &s;uch, that more ill has been
&s;aid of your Maje&s;ty's royal per&s;on and proceedings, than it were decent
for me to repeat; and, by having this end of the cord, your Maje&s;ty
may pluck out all the accomplices of &s;o wicked a fact, and learn why
they came to be guilty of it. Their accompli&s;hes here are as many al|mo&s;t
as there are of Iri&s;h. For all have &s;een, and either carried about
copies of the&s;e letters, or trumpeted their contents about; but there are
two more guilty than the re&s;t, viz. O'Farrel, a lawyer, and another law|yer
be&s;ides the bi&s;hop. I am confident the Queen &s;ends your Maje&s;ty
the original paper. I &s;hall endeavour to take off all the impre&s;&s;ions that
and &s;uch like have given, in which, hitherto, I have neither been idle
nor un&s;ucce&s;sful. I confe&s;s, I found, among&s;t the generality, a &s;trange
change. But it begins to clear up, and every day will more and more,
by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Almighty God.</P>
<P>One point in your Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions I had not in&s;i&s;ted on, as I
told your Maje&s;ty in my la&s;t, becau&s;e the Queen would fir&s;t think of it
among&s;t her Maje&s;ty, lord Waldgrave, and my&s;elf. This, at lea&s;t, &s;he
did, upon the repeated news of &s;ucce&s;s your Maje&s;ty had had. The
point was, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to go to England or Scotland; and, be&s;ides, the
advices from England were &s;o many &s;purs to ha&s;te her on to it; at lea&s;t,
the fear was, it &s;hould be looked on as a new propo&s;ition, and &s;he or we
looked on as incon&s;tant, and might hinder the &s;uccours promi&s;ed. This
I over-ruled, and &s;o was ordered to go on with it, when the Queen went
to Chaliot, and the court to Fountainbleau.&mdash;At Chaliot, Mr. de Lou|vois
came to vi&s;it her, and told her, that it would be fit to &s;end me to
Fountainblieu for ha&s;tening on the &s;uccours. She told him, that was
agreed on already; and I could do no more. However, he &s;aid, I was
one would be welcome to every body, and my very face would ha&s;ten
them, and keep them in mind. The Queen &s;ent for me, and told me
this before my lord Waldgrave; &s;o we took up the matter of going into
<PB N="322" REF="340">
England again, and concluded it was fit to propo&s;e it; but &s;o as that it
might not come as a new thing. So I was ready to go Thur&s;day la&s;t.
On Wedne&s;day, the Queen &s;ent for me, and told me &s;he had altered her
mind. Mr. de Lau&s;un had been there, and &s;he thought it would be to
no purpo&s;e to propo&s;e that matter at this time. I let her Maje&s;ty &s;ee,
that it was &s;o to be done as not to be a new thing. That it was of im|portance
to your Maje&s;ty, to know their opinion, and what you had to
rely on, and &s;o begged the manner might be left to me, which &s;he was
plea&s;ed to agree to; and &s;o I went on Friday. Saturday, I met with M.
de Louvois, and di&s;cour&s;ed long with him of the &s;tate of Ireland. I
&s;hewed him what the condition of it was at your Maje&s;ty's arrival there;
the difficulties you had to encounter, and the little help; the poverty of
the country, and the threatening wants, through the licencious plunder|ing
of the inhabitants, and de&s;troying the &s;tocks of the prote&s;tants; and
that the be&s;t corn country of Ireland either was entirely wa&s;te, or the
&s;eat of the war. That, from the&s;e, and the want of money, which would
infallibly be &s;o &s;oon as they came to be in greater quantity, than the or|dinary
&s;tock of money current in the kingdom. That all the&s;e things
make it evident, that Ireland cannot be long kept, without con&s;tant and
va&s;t &s;upplies.</P>
<P>That your Maje&s;ty went to Ireland only in your way to Britain; and
that the door there was open, &s;o &s;oon as any con&s;iderable party was ready
to join with your Maje&s;ty. So that, whenever that happened, you did
never que&s;tion the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King for your return
thither. That your Maje&s;ty had all the moral certainties imaginable to
believe, that England was now in tho&s;e circum&s;tances; and that, there|fore,
this was the time to provide for your Maje&s;ty's tran&s;portation and
&s;uccour. That it was the intere&s;t of France, and good <HI>menagerie,</HI> to
do &s;oon what mu&s;t be done at la&s;t, after a va&s;t lo&s;s of time and expences,
with more uncertainty. That there &s;till would be danger, and there &s;till
mu&s;t be an army to go, and a fleet to carry it. That there never could
be a greater di&s;proportion betwixt the fleets on the French &s;ide; and
that this was the &s;ea&s;on they could be&s;t &s;end their troops, and lea&s;t fear
any other enemy at &s;ea than wind and weather. A copy of all the&s;e ar|guments,
at length, I &s;hall &s;end your Maje&s;ty. This he him&s;elf intro|duced,
by a&s;king, what I thought would be the event of any advantage
<PB N="323" REF="341">
your Maje&s;ty could get in Ireland. I told him, that, if it were not
followed by further attempts, whil&s;t the one party were hearty, and the
other in fear, it would have no other effect than to ha&s;ten your ruin; and
that, by the forces they would &s;end again&s;t your Maje&s;ty in the &s;pring:
and that, in all probability, it would need more a&s;&s;i&s;tance to pre&s;erve Ire|land,
than it would do now to gain England; and &s;o went on. By this
means, it came to be no new propo&s;ition, nor did he look on it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>He told me, the men would be no great difficulty; the hor&s;es would;
but that the greate&s;t was the fleet. That, if the Engli&s;h kept out all they
had this &s;ummer, as was reported, it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to keep
out &s;o many.</P>
<P>I told him, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for the Engli&s;h to keep out their
great &s;hips this winter. That many of their other &s;hips were &s;o ill built,
and of green timber, that they would not be able to keep the &s;eas in this
rough weather; but, however, that the &s;ame difficulty occurred for the
6000 already conde&s;cended on; all which was out of di&s;pute, and what
could &s;afely carry them would need but &s;mall addition to &s;ecure the
re&s;t.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, that was not all. Ships to tran&s;port the hor&s;e and dragoons
mu&s;t be provided, and that would take time; and that a &s;mall number
of &s;hips not embarra&s;&s;ed with a convoy would be too hard for a far
greater number of &s;hips with a convoy. I told him, though I was not
&s;eaman enough to an&s;wer all the&s;e objections; yet I remember it was
not thought &s;o by the &s;eamen, when the King had the prince of Orange
to oppo&s;e. He told me, that the great difficulty yet remained; which
was, that, in ca&s;e of ill weather, they were ma&s;ters of no port on the
coa&s;t. I told him, that to me appeared the ea&s;ie&s;t: for that moment
your Maje&s;ty &s;et foot in England, you would be ma&s;ter of the be&s;t port
in it; and then, what with it, Ireland, and the coa&s;t of France, they
would be in a better condition than the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, when that
port was taken from them. He &s;aid, that he wi&s;hed it were in their
power to do this; but he did not think it po&s;&s;ible for them. However,
I was glad he would di&s;cour&s;e of it: a thing he could not be brought to
before, by letters.</P>
<P>He complained to me of lord Dover grievou&s;ly, for quarrelling him
in his own hou&s;e; and &s;aying, that, if the French intended to fell their
<PB N="324" REF="342">
wars &s;o dear, he was not come for that end. He &s;ays, that he told him,
that the lord Dover had taken him&s;elf to quarrelling, at which he was
very un&s;kilful; and &s;o they parted that time. That lord Dover had ex|cu&s;ed
that matter afterwards; but that he told him freely, that at this
court there needed a great practice and experience of affairs, and a good
temper, not to be &s;oon found out, and to make their matters go well on.
That, afterwards, &s;peaking of the affairs of Ireland, lord Dover &s;aid,
there were di&s;orders; but he was going back, and would take care to &s;ee
all put right; at which Mr. de Louvois laught much, and told the King
of France, Ireland was now &s;ecure, lord Dover was to take the govern|ment
on him. The&s;e are things I expected not from lord Dover; for
your Maje&s;ty may remember, that he told you, one cau&s;e of your affairs
going ill was, that I did not carry as I ought to Mr. de Louvois. To
me he was all kindne&s;s, and told me all the time, the comte de Lau&s;un
and others &s;aid all the ills of me. He had &s;till &s;aid, that if I had done
ten times wor&s;e, yet I was the only man about your Maje&s;ty he had ever
converted with capable of &s;erving in the&s;e &s;tations I was in. This I only
tell your Maje&s;ty, to &s;hew how far my coming has changed the talk here;
and, indeed, I think there was a good providence in it, in relation to your
Maje&s;ty's affairs; for it is not conceivable the villainous reports they
had &s;pread abroad. And, indeed, matters go too far, when &s;ubjects will
rai&s;e their reputation upon the ruin of that of their &s;overeign; yea, that
they dare connive at others doing it for them. Of the&s;e &s;orts of intelli|gences
there has been too many.</P>
<P>I find too, that Mr. de Lau&s;un is no ways &s;atisfied with my lord Do|ver's
conduct here, and thinks he was no ways fit to have been &s;ent;
and Mr. de Louvois told me, that he had &s;aid to his ma&s;ter, that he
pitied your Maje&s;ty, for having been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending
&s;uch a man. For his part, when he met with &s;uch men in bu&s;ine&s;s, he
knew no remedy but to go and &s;leep.</P>
<P>But to return to the other affair. I &s;poke fully to Mr. de Seignelay,
and found him more aver&s;e from hazarding the fleet than Mr. de Lou|vois
had been, and make the difficulties in&s;uperable for this &s;ea&s;on. I
pre&s;&s;ed him on it, as far as I thought rea&s;onable then; having a mind
not to put him out of patience, &s;o as that I might have room to begin
again at the court's return; and indeed I dur&s;t not pre&s;s, lea&s;t having
<PB N="325" REF="343">
taken the thing upon my&s;elf, any ill an&s;wer had been given, and I
blamed. On Sunday morning, I made the Queen's compliment to the
King, and thought to have &s;aid no more, but ju&s;t to put him in mind,
that the time was near in which he had promi&s;ed to &s;end the &s;uccours
into Ireland. But he entered in di&s;cour&s;e of the whole matter, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
all the kindne&s;s and all the re&s;pect imaginable to your Maje&s;ty
and to the Queen; gave me again an account of the a&s;&s;iette of his af|fairs;
and &s;aid, that he will not only do what he finds difficult, but if
there be a po&s;&s;ibility he de&s;ires no more, and &s;aid, that it was &s;o much
his own intere&s;t, that he was not to be &s;u&s;pected in the matter. That
Louvois had told him, that we had had a long di&s;cour&s;e together on your
Maje&s;ty's affairs; and that, if there remained any po&s;&s;ibility of doing
what I had propo&s;ed, in relation to your Maje&s;ty's pa&s;&s;age into England,
he would do it. But that, if by any accident he came to lo&s;e his fleet,
your Maje&s;ty's affairs would be de&s;perate, and his in an ill condition.
That he knew he was blamed, for not fighting the enemy this &s;ummer;
but that, I knew it, things were never repre&s;ented as they truely were:
for he did not think the &s;tate of the enemy &s;o bad as it really was. And
that, I knew well, &s;ome years ago, it would have been looked on as ex|travagant,
to &s;ay, France could have coped with any of the two &s;ea
powers; and now, though he confe&s;&s;ed it was not the &s;ame brave Engli&s;h,
but a company of rebels, yet both the powers were united again&s;t him.
That, if he came to fight on the coa&s;t of England, and had (as it could
not be otherwi&s;e) any di&s;abled &s;hips, not having a port near, all the&s;e
mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily lo&s;t. I told him, that, if it only &s;tood at that, your
Maje&s;ty's landing in England &s;ecured him one of the be&s;t, if not more.
He &s;aid, he was afraid that might harm your bu&s;ine&s;s in England. I
told him, that, if your Maje&s;ty did not go to England in a condition
above the&s;e precautions, you could not think to &s;ucceed. At that, he
&s;eemed to be plea&s;ed; &s;o I told him, that, one time or other, this mu&s;t
fall out; and doing it in time, would &s;ave much time, money, and
blood; and I did not doubt, that if he did apply him&s;elf to it, he would
find ways to overcome the mo&s;t difficult &s;teps that lay in the way; and
to think of it &s;oon would give the more time for the preparations. He
&s;aid, that, as for what concerned the 6000 men, he had taken his mea|&s;ures;
and that the regiments were named, and &s;hould &s;oon be at Bre&s;t,
<PB N="326" REF="344">
tho' he dur&s;t not let know which they were, le&s;t the ill opinion was here
of the Iri&s;h affairs might occa&s;ion them to run away; &s;o he mu&s;t bring
them by other ways: that he would, in all things, do his utmo&s;t for
your Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t; and a great deal more to this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon this whole matter, &s;eeing there is no body in the world knows
&s;o much of the &s;ea affairs as your Maje&s;ty does, it may be fit that your
Maje&s;ty &s;hould write to the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, on this &s;ubject, your|&s;elf;
and give him your opinion, how this matter may be done, and &s;end
your letter to the Queen, to &s;ee if it quadrates with the circum&s;tances
your Maje&s;ty's affairs may be in when it comes; and this, &s;o much the
rather, that I have the little &s;eal for &s;ealing, and &s;he will be &s;ure to
make the be&s;t u&s;e of what your Maje&s;ty &s;hall &s;o write; and, if there
be any thing to add to what I have &s;aid on the &s;ubject, your Maje&s;ty
would be plea&s;ed to &s;end it; and, in the mean time, I &s;hall &s;till be going
on, as far as it is po&s;&s;ible for me here, in conjunction with my lord
Waldegrave, who&s;e health obliges him to go and pa&s;s the winter in the
warmer climate.</P>
<P>I hope he gives your Maje&s;ty an account, that he and I live in that
perfect under&s;tanding your Maje&s;ty de&s;ires; and, if ever it &s;hould be
otherwi&s;e, I &s;hall look on my&s;elf as mo&s;t unfortunate.</P>
<P>The foreign news I leave entirely to my lord Waldegrave, and the
Queen has all the papers from England, except this, which I &s;end to
your Maje&s;ty; in which, you will &s;ee the true humour of Scotland, and
that what I foretold the D. Hamilton is true; that where one grumbled
at me, there would be a hundred open clamours again&s;t him, if ever he
came to have any hand in the government.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty will likewi&s;e &s;ee there, the bravery of Cannon and the
other Scotch officers, who mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;ort of relief, if your Ma|je&s;ty
thinks fit, con&s;idering the inconveniency of &s;ending any part of
what lands once in Ireland. The Queen may demand &s;omething to be
&s;ent immediately to Scotland, without touching at Ireland; and this to
be done &s;o &s;oon as the re&s;t is gone from Bre&s;t. Some arms, ammuni|tion,
and &s;ome money mu&s;t be had. It were pity &s;o many brave men
&s;hould peri&s;h without a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="345">
I confe&s;s I am in pain for their wants, though not &s;o much as for
the&s;e I know your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t needs have where you are, con&s;idering
how little ammunition was left; and, for that end, I begged of the in|tendant
to ha&s;ten what was ordered to go with all &s;peed. But I find all
&s;tays to go with my lord Dover, and he &s;tays for the Soleil d'Affrique,
which is to relieve the Jollie, and is not yet come from Rochfort. In|deed
this was not right; but, as I informed your Maje&s;ty in my la&s;t,
lord Dover gave all &s;o much for lo&s;t, and had convinced all here &s;o
much of it, that I found he had no great mind to go back: for he &s;aid
publickly at the table, the be&s;t could befall him was to be taken by
the way and carried to England: he had friends there, and the prince
of Orange would be kind to him. This he &s;aid to the duche&s;s of Powis,
and pretended to be angry when the act of attainder was again&s;t us,
(propo&s;ed, for it did not pa&s;s) that he had not writt into England, to
inform that he was not in Ireland; the attainder going only again&s;t
&s;uch as were there in arms, as they called it. The&s;e things are fooli&s;h.
At pre&s;ent, I am doing all I po&s;&s;ibly can to ha&s;ten on the &s;uccours; and
I will leave no &s;tone unturned to obtain your pa&s;&s;age into England: for
the more I &s;ee from thence, the more I find of rea&s;on for your Maje&s;ty's
hazarding there.</P>
<P>The matter of intelligence has been managed here by Mr. Innis and
his corre&s;pondents, all depending on the care of Sir Robert Clerk, who&s;e
concern for your royal intere&s;t is above what I am able to expre&s;s; and,
indeed, without him and his corre&s;pondent, author of this long letter I
&s;end you, there would be nothing here, but &s;torys one can make nothing
of, nor any way rely upon.</P>
<P>This corre&s;pondent, who&s;e name I know not, your Maje&s;ty will find
by his writings to be an intelligent man, and much knowing in all the
affairs, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Scotland; and that comes from his great fa|miliarity
with Scalmorly, Sir James Montgomery, and, by his means,
this man has had the influence to rai&s;e many a broil among&s;t them, and
is &s;till rai&s;ing more.</P>
<P>This corre&s;pondence mu&s;t be entertained; and that cannot be with|out
money: for the per&s;ons concerned have not whereon to live. This
mu&s;t be &s;oon too, and I thought it might have been &s;upplied from the
29,000 pounds your Maje&s;ty received for your&s;elf, of the 50,000 was
<PB N="328" REF="346">
given for your entertainment. But, upon di&s;cour&s;e with my lord Wald|grave,
I find he could not get the mini&s;ters to let him know what they
re&s;olved in that matter; nor to explain whether it was paid or not, or
whether it was to be paid at all. This is unlucky; but it mu&s;t be
known; for it is of importance, that di&s;tinction be made of what is for
your entertainment, and what for the war; yet &s;o as no exception can
be taken at the demand. The difference I take to be this, that what is
given for entertainment, your Maje&s;ty may di&s;po&s;e of for &s;uch ends as
you &s;hall think fit; and, indeed, I think your Maje&s;ty will need a con|&s;iderable
part of it to live on, and for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch as are like
to &s;tarve in gaols in England upon your Maje&s;ty's account, and &s;ome
part of it mu&s;t go for &s;uch intelligence, as they would &s;tarve; for they
believe none but their own, and all the&s;e are refugees and fanaticks, who
write all the whig news they can pick up. This will not do your bu&s;i|ne&s;s.
Be&s;ides, &s;ome per&s;on mu&s;t be &s;ent to give an account of your Ma|je&s;ty's
affairs, le&s;t they, who all pretend to &s;kill in the politicks, make
judgment on the wrong notions they have; and &s;o believe, that your
Maje&s;ty would be incapable of relieving them, tho' you come back: &s;o
ill an opinion have they of your conduct; and &s;o little they know the
condition of your affairs. As for example, all who come from England
rail again&s;t me as a traitor and a Sunderland, or wor&s;e, if that can be;
becau&s;e that I dur&s;t not come into England my&s;elf; and, therefore, had
hindered your Maje&s;ty from coming, tho' you had arms enough, 15,000
French all this &s;ummer in the army, 700,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling money from
France, and the command of their whole fleet. I confe&s;s, had this been
&s;o, I mu&s;t have been wor&s;e than they can conceive of me, if I had been
again&s;t your Maje&s;ty's going. But, as fooli&s;h as this is, it is univer&s;ally
believed; and, therefore, there mu&s;t be a way of true intelligence found,
which I am now upon, both directly from England to your Maje&s;ty, and
by this.</P>
<P>Fergus Graham<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Brother to the lord Pre&s;ton.</NOTE>, being come over here, will be the fit man to be
the fir&s;t informer of the true &s;tate of your affairs; and how much your
Maje&s;ty de&s;erves the prai&s;e of all the world for your conduct in Ireland,
in&s;tead of being reproached. I thought to have &s;ent Tempe&s;t fir&s;t; but
he will not look &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted as the other, who came fraught with com|plaints
<PB N="329" REF="347">
again&s;t me, and is now fully &s;atisfied of the folly of them, and
all the things they &s;o fully believe in England. Be&s;ides, he is a fit man
to take a farm, or find a farmer on the &s;ea coa&s;t, for laying down of
letters. If he think better to go to Ireland, I will &s;end Mr. Tempe&s;t
only to lord Pre&s;ton and that gang; for there are &s;everal gangs who tru&s;t
not one another; and all the&s;e mu&s;t be managed &s;eparately, according
to their tempers and de&s;ires, and what is po&s;&s;ible to be done mu&s;t be to
keep them in heart; and yet not make them believe what we are &s;ure
cannot be performed; for, at the long run, &s;uch things does infinite
harm.</P>
<P>The next matter of great importance, is the management of this new
Pope, who, they &s;ay, is entirely for France. He gained, but by one
vote, to be elected; and all the French cardinals voted for him: &s;o he
owes his election to them, and the duke de Chaunes is his mo&s;t intimate
friend. They lived long in one hou&s;e together; and that duke was in|&s;tructed
to &s;tand for him, though none of the other parties imagined it;
and he being a Venetian, is of a &s;tate has mo&s;t generou&s;ly e&s;pou&s;ed your
Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t, and put affronts on the re&s;ident the prince of Orange
would have &s;ent, and has continued yours, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Ma|je&s;ty's
right; and, it's &s;aid, that it was this Ottoboni who, before the
election, propo&s;ed, that a con&s;iderable part of the money found with
the old Pope's trea&s;urers, &s;hould be employed for your Maje&s;ty's re&s;to|ration.
Mo&s;t certain it is, that he has begun to compliment France,
and has a&s;&s;ured the amba&s;&s;ador of all the bulls now wanting for France;
and the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King has pre&s;ented him with Avignon. So that
I hope God will &s;mile again on your Maje&s;ty's affairs, from that rigid
corner from which &s;o many of your misfortunes &s;pring.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance your Maje&s;ty is at, made me advi&s;e the Queen to make
your excu&s;e, and to &s;end her compliments early, and to begin to lay your
Maje&s;ty's condition at his Holine&s;s' feet; and I my&s;elf have made bold
to write to the cardinals d'E&s;te and Norfolk. The&s;e letters, whereof I
have &s;ent copies inclo&s;ed, that your Maje&s;ty may &s;ee what I do; in which,
if I do ami&s;s, your Maje&s;ty will pardon a zeal that cannot let &s;lip any
occa&s;ion of &s;erving you, which my con&s;cience convinces me is for the
be&s;t; and I &s;hall go on with this, till I have your Maje&s;ty's commands
in the matter, and your own letters, which may either be done there, or
<PB N="330" REF="348">
the inclo&s;ed copy followed and &s;igned by your Maje&s;ty, and &s;ent back
open to me, as you &s;hall plea&s;e to order, together with the&s;e to the car|dinals.
But I am yet to &s;ee the mini&s;ters here; and &s;hall lay all before
your Maje&s;ty, in the be&s;t method I can, before this expre&s;s is di&s;|patched.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome four or five hundred Iri&s;h officers and &s;oldiers come
to Li&s;le, from Hambourgh, through all imaginable difficulties, till they
came to the duke of Lorraine's army; who told them, if they &s;aid they
were to &s;erve in France, he mu&s;t put them in pri&s;on: but, if they were
to go and &s;erve their own King, he would give them all pa&s;&s;es. So
they &s;aid they were to go to your Maje&s;ty to &s;erve you; and he not only
gave them pa&s;&s;es, but money to bear their expences: a thing &s;o generous
as de&s;erves your royal thanks; and, indeed, it has gained him more
reputation here, than mo&s;t things he could have done, con&s;idering his
circum&s;tances with the Emperor. The&s;e men we hope to get over &s;u|pernumerary,
when the re&s;t comes. I never knew what impatience was,
as now to be &s;o long of hearing from your Maje&s;ty; e&s;pecially at a time
when there is all the rea&s;on in the world to believe &s;ome con&s;iderable
action mu&s;t have been done; and, indeed, in the circum&s;tance your Ma|je&s;ty's
army was, I think it is a con&s;iderable proof of your Maje&s;ty's
conduct, that you did not run behind the Shannon, as others advi&s;ed
you, and as your army had done, had not you been at the head of it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<OPENER>At St. Germain, <DATE>25th October.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been &s;everal times at this place, in order to lay down ways for
carrying on your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; wherein, I hope, now, at la&s;t,
&s;omething more con&s;iderable may be done. For the Queen will give
your Maje&s;ty an account of the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e &s;he had with this King,
and I &s;hall be &s;ure to pre&s;s it on with the mini&s;ters all I can, &s;o long as
I am here. But I confe&s;s an unexpected thing has happened to me, by
a propo&s;al of the Queen's to me, to go to Rome. I defended my&s;elf
from it, with that deference I owe to her Maje&s;ty; and layed out my
per&s;onal defects for that employment. But, withall, laid my&s;elf at her
feet, to be di&s;po&s;ed of. I likewi&s;e would not plead my character already,
for an excu&s;e; but would have had her &s;ee it might have been one, if
the nece&s;&s;ity was not urgent. She &s;aid &s;he would hope, that if the King
<PB N="331" REF="349">
here were of the mind, that it were fit I would not refu&s;e the thing.
I am not of a temper ever to refu&s;e any thing, which may be for your
Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, what hazard or tro$ble &s;oever there may be in it.
Of this, I believe, her Maje&s;ty will give you an account, and how the
mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King was violent for it, as a thing of great importance to
your Maje&s;ty and to him both, which I had confirmed to me, by M.
de Seignelay, this day again.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, therefore, tell your Maje&s;ty, that I go, when they order me
to be gone; and that I expect your Maje&s;ty's approbation of my going,
and your commands to me, in the terms here inclo&s;ed, or &s;uch others,
as your Maje&s;ty &s;hall think fit. But it &s;eems to me mo&s;t proper, to &s;hun
all expences, that I have no character, but that of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ecre|tary
of &s;tate; and that your Maje&s;ty's letters have the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in
it. For it will not be fit, that one in my circum&s;tances be made an en|voy;
and, I am confident, your Maje&s;ty would not put it upon me,
and there is not wherewithal to keep out the po&s;t of an amba&s;&s;ador:
&s;o &s;ecretary is more to be believed, than both the other characters, more
honour and le&s;s charge. This, I hope, your Maje&s;ty will approve of,
and ha&s;te back, two or three &s;everal ways, duplicates of what I &s;end
inclo&s;ed for your Maje&s;ty to &s;ign. The rea&s;on that I leave the in|&s;tructions
&s;o general is, that I am confident your Maje&s;ty is per&s;uaded,
that I will do all that lies in my power to &s;erve you in every thing,
and that I have the di&s;cretion not to do what I ought not, in any of
your Maje&s;ty's concerns.</P>
<P>If there be nece&s;&s;ity to have letters to any cardinals, &s;uch as the car|dinals
employed in affairs by this Pope, of whom we cannot now think
your Maje&s;ty will not take it ill, I &s;ign &s;uch letters only of compli|ment
for you, which I will not do, but only in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; and
that, I hope, &s;hall not occur.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that I ought not to have gone without your Maje&s;ty's
commands, if I had not thought that I could &s;erve you both in this
matter. But, to &s;ay the truth, I have been &s;o to&s;&s;ed up and down, I
have no will of my own; and, therefore, what&s;oever is be&s;t for your
Maje&s;ty I do it without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>I hope to get the&s;e duplicates of this di&s;patch &s;ent next week; and,
therefore, I &s;hall not now enlarge on this matter, of which your Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="332" REF="350">
will &s;ee I had no thought, by my letters to the cardinals d'E&s;t&eacute; and
Norfolk. For, though I thought it might be fit, when I was in Ire|land,
and gave it in a note to your Maje&s;ty, yet it was quite out of my
thoughts, having no orders from you; and, be&s;ides, now, that, upon
what pa&s;&s;ed at Fountainbleau, and the conferences I had with the mini|&s;ters,
the &s;ame things being urged by the Queen to the King here, he
begin$ to think more of the affairs of England (as po&s;&s;ible); and that
probably he will tru&s;t your Maje&s;ty with his fleet; I might hope to be &s;o
happy as to &s;ee your Maje&s;ty in England once again: but I &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell your Maje&s;ty, that there is nothing &s;o wicked, that &s;ome
here, and others from England do not vent again&s;t me. But, I am afraid,
they will be found as little your Maje&s;ty's friends, at the long run, as
the&s;e in Scotland were. My happine&s;s is to have your Maje&s;ty for my
judge, who, I flatter my&s;elf, knows the bottom of my heart; and that
it is as true as ever was in any &s;ubject's brea&s;t. I am, therefore, hope|ful
they will have no influence on your Maje&s;ty, who&s;e goodne&s;s to me,
on &s;o many occa&s;ions, is the only comfort of my life; and that I e&s;teem,
above all the &s;hare I have of this world. Forgive me &s;aying &s;o much,
tho' it is of one &s;o entirely your Maje&s;ty's own, by all the ties which
bind a faithful &s;ubject to the be&s;t of ma&s;ters, as well as Kings.</P>
<P>Since writing this, it's thought ab&s;olutely fit, that there be another
copy of the letter to the Pope, with credentials in it to me, as emba&s;&s;a|dor
extraordinary, &s;ent hither to he in the Queen's hands, till &s;he and
the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King find it nece&s;&s;ary to make u&s;e of them. For it
is mo&s;t certain I will, at fir&s;t da&s;h, have all the Spani&s;h and German
faction upon me; and that being the mo&s;t ceremonious court in the
world, things not yet &s;een may occur, which may not &s;uffer the delay
of &s;ending to Ireland; and, therefore, it's be&s;t to depo&s;it the&s;e let|ters
in the Queen's hands. The form is herewith &s;ent. All of them
have papers &s;ewed on them, to &s;hew what they are for; and they mu&s;t
all be with flying &s;eals, or not &s;ealed at all; for I can do that when I
get them.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent your Maje&s;ty the news from England, at length; an intel|ligence
which, if rightly made u&s;e of here, your affairs had been more
forwardly, both in England and here. But, to &s;ay true, its &s;tarved, and
like to be broken off. The u&s;e which &s;hould have been made of it, was
<PB N="333" REF="351">
to have turned it into French, and to have &s;ent it to the court of France;
by which they would have &s;een, by what &s;teps we came to believe that
there is a party in England ready to join, which is &s;till what they have
mo&s;t doubted of. This I had begun, and likewi&s;e a corre&s;pondence in
England, by which I had informed them right of the &s;olid things they
were to expect, in&s;tead of the&s;e airy follies they are undone by, and
learn them to go on better mea&s;ures; though, indeed, lord Arran and
&s;ome pretending to do your Maje&s;ty &s;ervice, have mo&s;t unju&s;tly injured
me; but, if they &s;erve you, I forgive them; and would go further
than I am going, if that can advance your Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t a &s;tep.
This letter is &s;o impertinently long, that I am a&s;hamed of it, though it
is fit your Maje&s;ty know as much as po&s;&s;ible of what pa&s;&s;es here; and,
indeed, it were to be wi&s;hed, that there were &s;ome of experience and
knowledge of affairs here. For tho' the Queen has as little need of
any to help her, as ever any body, man or woman, had, yet it is an ca&s;e
for her, &s;ometimes to have people to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; and my lord Wald|grave's
&s;ickne&s;s hinders him from thinking of many things too important
to be neglected. Be&s;ides, that, for &s;ome time, he is to be quite ab&s;ent.
I confe&s;s I never &s;aw any body under&s;tand affairs better than the Queen;
and &s;he has really gained &s;o much the e&s;teem of the King here, and his
mini&s;ters, that I am truly of the opinion, if it had not been for her,
the wicked reports &s;pread here had made your affairs go entirely wrong
at the court. I dare not enter to &s;peak of the prince, for adding to
this volume; only, I do prote&s;t, that he is, without any &s;ort of flattery,
the fine&s;t child I ever &s;aw. God Almighty ble&s;s your Maje&s;ty, the Queen,
and him for your comfort: grant you the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your own, and

<HEAD>&startq;Rea&s;ons why his Maje&s;ty ought to go with all diligence into England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers. D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 77.</NOTE>
October 20th, 1689.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>&startq;THE kingdom of Ireland, at long run, is not to be kept, again&s;t
England and Scotland, without a va&s;t charge.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="352">
The kingdom of Ireland is &s;o exhau&s;ted, by the many great di&s;orders,
rapines, plunderings, and robberies, that it is not able to furni&s;h any
con&s;iderable part of this expence.</P>
<P>The King went to Ireland, only in order to go to England, &s;o &s;oon
as it was in a condition to receive him, with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s.
This probability is, when a con&s;iderable party of the nation is ready to
embrace his Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t, e&s;pecially the men of quality.</P>
<P>The King, being convinced this is now the ca&s;e, has all the inclina|tion
imaginable to proceed on this de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion then is, if the&s;e be the circum&s;tances of England and
Scotland at this time; which mu&s;t be tried, by any means &s;hall be
thought fit; which being found true, his Maje&s;ty, &s;o generou&s;ly a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
hitherto, by the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, hath no rea&s;on to que&s;tion
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in this &s;o glorious enterprize, his intere&s;t, as well as glory,
being concerned in it.</P>
<P>The kingdom of France is not only &s;urrounded with enemies; which
way &s;oever one looks, they &s;till &s;ee a formidable enemy before them;
and, be&s;ides, the King is forced to guard a long &s;ea-coa&s;t, to pre&s;erve his
kingdom from inva&s;ion on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>All the coa&s;t, at the King's fir&s;t landing, will be immediately out of
danger, and the troops there have leave to be employed el&s;ewhere, to
the great advantage of France; and, as the &s;ucce&s;s is great in Ireland,
the Auxbourg league grows weak: for had the King no other thing to do,
but to a&s;&s;i&s;t France, they would &s;oon force their enemies to accept of a
peace of their propo&s;ing.</P>
<P>The expences of this, at pre&s;ent, will be money &s;aved next year mo&s;t
con&s;iderable; for what will now be requi&s;ite will not pre&s;erve Ireland
&s;ix months; and this mu&s;t be done, at long run, ere the King be re|e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The men the King &s;ends to his Maje&s;ty's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, being &s;ix thou|&s;and,
it will be no difficult matter to make them up to eight thou&s;and,
to give &s;ifteen hundred hor&s;e and five hundred dragoons, con&s;idering
that, by this, the whole &s;ea-coa&s;t is relieved, and &s;ufficiently guarded.</P>
<P>The tran&s;portation can be no in&s;uperable difficulty, &s;eeing the mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian King hath many more &s;hips of fifty guns and under, than the
<PB N="335" REF="353">
Engli&s;h and Dutch. Be&s;ides, the Maloines and all the&s;e, being &s;hips
proper for winter, will be fitter for this purpo&s;e, than bigger &s;hips.</P>
<P>The&s;e, or a con&s;iderable part of them, mu&s;t be &s;ent, however, to
tran&s;port the &s;uccours already conde&s;cended to; and the addition will
not be of that importance, as to delay &s;o con&s;iderable a de&s;ign for
France, as well as for the King.</P>
<P>The ports of Ireland for the French are as u&s;eful, as tho&s;e of Eng|land
can be to the Engli&s;h and Dutch; and their &s;hips, being truly
&s;tronger and better manned, are in a better condition to keep the &s;eas
and for fighting. Be&s;ides that, the officers are better, have more ho|nour,
and fight for a King they ju&s;tly adore; and that the others
have neither honour, experience, nor care of the u&s;urper, and only fight
for pay.</P>
<P>There are hardly, in &s;ummer, many days found, in which fleets can
fight: how much le&s;s is &s;uch weather to be found in winter?</P>
<P>There are many difficulties in the matter. But it is well known,
the mo&s;t difficult things to other nations, and impracticable by other
councils, have been contrived and acted with &s;ucce&s;s in France; and, it
is to be hoped, they will find expedients for this matter, which other le&s;s
wi&s;e or experienced may ju&s;tly de&s;pair of.</P>
<P>By delay, Ireland will be wearied out with a long war; and the do|me&s;tic
di&s;orders have been &s;o great, that it's to be feared there will
hardly be wherewith to feed the armies next &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The King's friends, who have been in an anxious expectation of him
all this &s;ummer, will be tired out by impri&s;onment, &s;ines, proce&s;&s;es,
plunderings, and, what is wor&s;e, have an ill opinion of the King's con|duct,
and de&s;pair that ever they &s;hall be relieved; and &s;o turn in to where
they may be covered from the violence of that tempe&s;t they are threat|ened
with.</P>
<P>The remainder of the party in Scotland, already almo&s;t ruined by
delays, will be quite pulled up by the roots, and the u&s;urpation &s;o &s;ettled,
that it will be mo&s;t difficult to &s;hake it.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange will have an excu&s;e to &s;end all the Briti&s;h forces.
out of England and Scotland, as if to reduce Ireland, and &s;o have an
<PB N="336" REF="354">
opportunity to fill that i&s;le with foreigners; which would be more dif|ficult,
if the forces were at home, and the people put on their guard,
as they may be, by fit in&s;truments, at London; and Scotland is already
upon this foot of demanding the fulfilling of promi&s;es, in regard to
their privilege, and yet they have no &s;uch ground of complaint as a fo|reign
army would be.</P>
<P>The King can take the number he de&s;igns now from Ireland, without
hazarding that kingdom, all action being there near an end, which
he cannot do, if the &s;ummer were come; and, by this means, Ire|land
will be &s;afer than it is now; the true way to pre&s;erve it, being to
attack England. This expedient has been of u&s;e before, in as con&s;ider|able
a ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The advantages the King will have are, that, being on the &s;ame
continent with his friends, they will dare to &s;how them&s;elves; and
the indifferent will be obliged to take party, the oppre&s;&s;ed will re&s;ent
their ill-u&s;age, the old di&s;banded army have an opportunity to revenge
them&s;elves, the Catholicks have a head to rally to, the church of Eng|land
the confidence to &s;ay they are injured and to demand redre&s;s,
the non-conformi&s;ts, ever trimmers in danger, &s;tand and look on,
and leave the prince and his &s;trangers to act for them&s;elves; re&s;ent|ments
of wrongs, hopes of advantage, pardon, preferment, or &s;afety,
each argument will have its party, and the giddy humour of that nation,
never content, will make them as apt to huzanna, as they were before
to per&s;ecute; and, in general, it is a &s;trong argument to be in peace,
on the legal foot; a thing not to be hoped for under the u&s;urper. The
prince of Wales is no more di&s;puted. God be ble&s;&s;ed, he thrives. This
was looked on as impo&s;&s;ible, and was the &s;tronge&s;t argument to join
with that prince, whom, they thought, would, &s;ooner or later, be their
ma&s;ter, and u&s;e them as they &s;hould now do him. The bribes he pro|mi&s;ed
are not paid; or, if they be, they who have them would be con|tent
to &s;ave them. All the&s;e things make for the King's going, as
&s;oon as it is po&s;&s;ible for him.</P>
<P>At his landing, the be&s;t port in England will be in his hands; which,
being &s;ecured, affords a &s;ecure retreat to any &s;hips of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
King, who &s;hall have any need thereof, e&s;pecially in ca&s;e of any engage|ment
on the coa&s;t of England. Going, at this &s;ea&s;on, &s;ecures any po&s;t
<PB N="337" REF="355">
the King &s;hall take, if he re&s;olves not to advance, through any di&s;ap|pointment
he may meet with; the &s;ea&s;on making the action difficult, in
that country where the King mu&s;t land, except the numbers be unequal,
as it is &s;uppo&s;ed the King's will be much &s;uperior to what the prince of
Orange can bring; who has not now above ten thou&s;and foot in all the
&s;outh of England, and very few hor&s;e or dragoons.</P>

<P>THE la&s;t later I had the honour of writing to your Maje&s;ty was &s;o
long, that it has not le&s;t much for me to &s;ay; and this carries the
duplicate of that whole di&s;patch; and, therefore, I mu&s;t not weary your
Maje&s;ty with too long a letter now.</P>
<P>The wicked informations which have been &s;ent hither, are of wor&s;e
con&s;equence, and more unea&s;y to remove, than I thought them to be;
becau&s;e there comes daily fre&s;h &s;upplies to &s;upport the old; and &s;o in|du&s;trious
they are here, they need but a hint to &s;erve for a foundation.
They build upon it abundantly.</P>
<P>M D'Avaux is not idle of his &s;ide. The la&s;t po&s;t was full of his in|vectives.
(But I mu&s;t fir&s;t caution your Maje&s;ty, that it mu&s;t be for
your own u&s;e, left I hurt my informers; for they &s;aw the letter it&s;elf).
In the fir&s;t place, he &s;ays, that all things now go well, &s;ince I was &s;ent
away: that all the Iri&s;hmen have another heart, &s;ince they &s;aw my lord
Tyrconnel with them; and that it is evidently &s;een the prejudice I did
to your Maje&s;ty's affairs. This he has rea&s;on to write here. But how
does this agree with the great de&s;ire he &s;hewed to have me &s;tay?</P>
<P>In the next place, he &s;ays, that now your Maje&s;ty is beginning to take
up the prote&s;tants of Dublin; and that, once before, there were a good
many in pri&s;on; but that I let them out without order; and that for
<PB N="338" REF="356">
many I gave pa&s;&s;es, at Cork and Kin&s;ale, to men who now are with Schom|berg,
and that after my coming away from Dublin. The&s;e things are
&s;uch follies as all wi&s;e men laugh at, and his be&s;t friends here &s;ay, that he
pu&s;hes the matter too far to be believed: for he has &s;hewn malice, and
&s;o de&s;erves no credit; and, as for what relates to me, I laugh at him,
and would &s;ay no more; but to you there are &s;ome things el&s;e to be
&s;aid. Mr. de Lauzun is to go over, and I am afraid that he and the
amba&s;&s;ador will not agree long together. This will draw in my lady,
and con&s;equently my lord Tyrconnel, and there will be a war in your
own court, which I &s;led hither to &s;hun: for that end, that there may be
no di&s;&s;ention, it were &s;it D' Avaux were recalled; which advice (as many
others I have given) is downright again&s;t my own intere&s;t; for it would
be no &s;mall ju&s;tification to me here, if he &s;hould agree as ill with Mr.
de Lauzun; and, be&s;ides, it's better for me now, that I &s;hall not be
here, that he were at a di&s;tance likewi&s;e. But that does not bias me.
He ought to be recalled, for the quiet of your affairs. He could not
agree with one &s;ubmitted to him: how will he with one who will not
yield an ace, nor let him meddle with French troops pay or preferment?
this I &s;ee is the other's temper, and I dread the con&s;equences. There is
one other thing, if it could be effectuate, were of infinite u&s;e; which is
the getting the duche&s;s of Tyrconnel, for her health, to come into France.
I did not know &s;he had been &s;o well known here as &s;he is; but the terms
they give her, and which, for your &s;ervice, I may repeat unto you, is,
that &s;he has <HI>(I' ame la plus noire qui &s;e pui&s;&s;e concevoir.)</HI> I think it would
help to keep that peace, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for you, and prevent that caballing
humour, which has very ill effects.</P>
<P>The&s;e things I write, not for the outward appearance, but becau&s;e
there is a &s;ecret &s;pring at bottom I confe&s;s I like not; and that on two
accounts. Fir&s;t, it is &s;aid, Churchill has more influence in that matter,
and this I believe not, except &s;he have &s;ent her money into England.
But the &s;econd is another thing, the keeping up a corre&s;pondence here,
the bottom whereof I will not under&s;tand; fir&s;t, by her&s;elf with Mr.
Courtin and by him; and &s;econdly, by the nephew with the Iri&s;h here,
who begin to have di&s;cour&s;es of the freedom of their nation. I mu&s;t not
repeat, but your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t prevent, le&s;t it come too late, by putting
it out of the power of any one family to make Ireland change a ma&s;ter.
<PB N="339" REF="357">
This is that what prudence demands without &s;u&s;pecting any, and I mu&s;t
humbly lay it before your Maje&s;ty the true way to do this. As I have
often &s;aid, get men of your own independent men, on whom build a
government as united in your Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, but as inde|pendent
of one another. I wi&s;h I had the honour to be half an hour
with you for the rea&s;ons of this advice, which I dare not write left this
fall in hands there. The per&s;on who carries on the de&s;ign here is bi&s;hop
Malony, and it is plainly a faction of almo&s;t all the Iri&s;h to lay all
blame at your door and to applaud Tyrconnel; not that they care for him,
otherwi&s;e than that he is Iri&s;h. They &s;ay openly, that no man is to be
tru&s;ted, but the Iri&s;h; and that now is the time to play their game or
never. They cur&s;e the la&s;t parliament, as a company of ea&s;y men, for
not &s;ticking to their demands; and that, in the next, they will have
other things done, e&s;pecially the overturning Poynings laws, &amp;c. Lord
Clare has written to bi&s;hop Malony, telling him, that they will tru&s;t
none but their own countrymen; and, therefore, &s;hortly there will be an
envoy there, for their affairs; but he will employ his intere&s;t, that Ma|lony
&s;hall be the man. From this, your Maje&s;ty will find the nece&s;&s;ity
of having no parliament; and, on my con&s;cience, I think it &s;o much for
your &s;ervice, that I am confident you will not &s;uffer any to meet. You
want not excu&s;es too good; but it will be attempted mo&s;t certainly.
But I hope, in God, no per&s;ua&s;ion will make you yield to it. In the
next place, there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to call over to Ireland this bi&s;hop
Malony; for he is not what he ought to be. His corre&s;pondent, for that
letter, is Sir Neal O'Neal, nephew of my lord Tyrconnel; and, if your
Maje&s;ty make not an example of him, all will pa&s;s for true he has &s;ent;
and one &s;uch action, judged by the council or judges, would put a &s;top
to the&s;e &s;tories here, if rightly u&s;ed. And, for another means, I mu&s;t
beg of you to examine the French amba&s;&s;ador, as not knowing a thing
written by him; but as a report here, if any &s;uch things has been &s;aid
to him; and, if he denies it, to write it to me. If he &s;ays, there has,
cau&s;e examine it fully, and &s;end the i&s;&s;ue; but let it be examined when
your Maje&s;ty is pre&s;ent. I know the re&s;t are not to be tru&s;ted. This,
if it were only for my vindication, I &s;hould not have the confidence to
a&s;k, though I flatter my&s;elf with the hopes, your goodne&s;s to me would
not refu&s;e to clear a faithful &s;ervant, that does almo&s;t nothing, be&s;ides
<PB N="340" REF="358">
your &s;ervice; and who&s;e zeal, for your intere&s;t, I hope, your Maje&s;ty is
per&s;uaded of. But, indeed, it is your own intere&s;t I pur&s;ue in this, that
his black calumnies again&s;t your Maje&s;ty's proceedings may not be
tru&s;ted hereafter. For ju&s;t now he complains of the ra&s;hne&s;s of your
conduct, in going on to Aller&s;ton-bridge, &s;o near the enemy, and that
again&s;t his advice, and that of all the general officers of his nation. I
do not find, that has taken here: for your Maje&s;ty is much commended
for it: only all are of opinion, that, if you are forced to retire, you
&s;hould chicane, and &s;till ruin all behind you. This Mr. de Belfond
came with a card ye&s;terday to &s;hew me. I mo&s;t humbly beg leave now
to go to the other &s;ide of the water.</P>
<P>By the advices from England, your Maje&s;ty will &s;ee the di&s;po&s;ition
of affairs, and the nece&s;&s;ity of following the&s;e affairs more clo&s;ely. In|deed
there are many things to do, which require the utmo&s;t &s;kill and
application; and am &s;orry, that I mu&s;t leave them; but I will tell your
Maje&s;ty the heads of what is to be done. Scotland is di&s;&s;atisfied; would
offer fair. I have given the heads. The&s;e a&s;&s;urances I know your
Maje&s;ty will approve of; that is, they offer to yield, without capitulat|ing
for religion, they having the pardon for what is pa&s;t. I have writ|ten,
that they doing the be&s;t to bring your Maje&s;ty back by the&s;e ways
they have in their hands, they &s;hall not only have pardon for lives and
fortunes, but they &s;hall have rewards &s;uitable to the actual &s;ervices
they &s;hall hereafter perform. Now going away, without their an&s;wer, I
leave that to the Queen, and am confident your Maje&s;ty will forgive
for hazarding &s;uch things, when a day is of importance, as it is in this
ca&s;e, by rea&s;on they are at London, and actually now treating with
Orange.</P>
<P>As for the Engli&s;h, they are divided in factions. One knows not of
another; yet I would have found a way to have let mo&s;t of them know
your Maje&s;ty's mind; but that I mu&s;t leave too; only I mu&s;t &s;ay, this
corre&s;pondence mu&s;t be continued, and the money nece&s;&s;ary for that left
here in the Queen's hands, and I &s;hall leave a memorial with her of the
way it is to be done. Now that I am &s;ent to Rome, I hope I &s;hall &s;erve
your Maje&s;ty u&s;efully there; though, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I &s;aw more to be
done here, that others under&s;tand not, than I do there, where I am but
as others, without experience, their language, or acquaintance. But I am
<PB N="341" REF="359">
glad to go, where God ordains, and your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice calls me.
The M. C. King has given to me of allowance, as to his amba&s;&s;adors
extraordinary, and has given me a memorial, a copy whereof I &s;end
inclo&s;ed. I can only &s;ay to your Maje&s;ty, that there &s;hall be no want of
me, except of natural under&s;tanding; for what I have &s;hall be employed
to the utmo&s;t. I have been happy in Mr. Tallon, who has got me ac|quainted
with &s;ome men of admirable knowledge in the matters of that
court, and I hope all &s;hall do well. I &s;hall be ordered in every thing
by cardinal D'E&s;t&eacute;, and he &s;hall be the witne&s;s of all my actions. I
hope your Maje&s;ty will be plea&s;ed to have all that you think fit con|&s;tantly
tran&s;mitted to me, and defend me from all my enemies behind
me: for I am determined never to look back, when your &s;ervice lies be|fore
me. I have rea&s;ons of great weight to &s;end over father Maxwell
to wait on your Maje&s;ty, for a corre&s;pondence I mu&s;t not have known to
any but your Maje&s;ty; and I humbly beg it of your Maje&s;ty to
take him, as one of your chaplains, the time he &s;tays; him&s;elf de&s;erves
it on many accounts, and your Maje&s;ty has none of his nation. But
the&s;e are not now the only rea&s;ons. I beg it for your own &s;ervice, and
what I &s;hall an&s;wer your Maje&s;ty &s;hall have no cau&s;e to repent of. I
have told him many things, as under confe&s;&s;ion, with power only to re|veal
them to your&s;elf; and he, knowing the jealou&s;y, will be better able
to watch the de&s;igns of the&s;e caballers, and to let you know their pro|gre&s;s;
for I have given him his mea&s;ures here, and I am &s;ure he will
obey them exactly.</P>

kingdoms of Great Britain; and that mo&s;t of them at Paris have been
of this mind.</P>
<P>That upon this de&s;ign it was, that they were &s;o <HI>opiniatre</HI> in &s;ome
points in the parliament; and that, after it, they decried the King's
proceedings, to make it the ea&s;ier to go off from him, if they found any
to accept of them.</P>
<P>That it was for this, they would have all Iri&s;h &s;ecretaries and other

this matter the more clo&s;ely.</P>
<P>To furni&s;h the&s;e at Paris with arguments of the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e
things, &s;ome in Ireland were employed to write letters to defame the
King and his government, and to cry up that of the natives.</P>
<P>The&s;e letters were all tran&s;lated into French, and by bi&s;hop Malony,
taking on him as empowered for Ireland, communicated to the court of
France.</P>
<P>That it was, for this rea&s;on, they could not &s;uffer the earl of Melfort,
&s;u&s;pecting that he would &s;oon &s;ee this matter, of which the King knows
his &s;u&s;picions founded on appearances.</P>
<P>That the duche&s;s of Tyrconnel is a main in&s;trument, in carrying on
this de&s;ign, and keeps a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with M. Courtin, and,
by him, with M. Louvois. That, for this rea&s;on, bi&s;hop Malony &s;tays
here, and had the impudence to give one of the&s;e lybels to the Queen,
and to propo&s;e to her the having an Iri&s;h envoy at the court of France;
he him&s;elf having the promi&s;e of lord Clare and others for their endea|vours,
that he &s;hall be the man.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, it's &s;aid to be, that M. D'Avaux had made a fac|tion
among&s;t the Iri&s;h; but that the de&s;ign was rejected with &s;corn here.
For that rea&s;on, that advice was given to abandon the kingdom to
Schomberg, thinking the King would lo&s;e the hearts of the people, by
de&s;erting them; and others gain it, by recovering it again, when the
<PB N="343" REF="361">
&s;uccours came over. This de&s;ign not reli&s;hed here, they u&s;e only to per|&s;uade
the u&s;efulne&s;s of it.</P>
<P>Many more things are &s;aid, and original informations to be &s;hewn the
Queen of all the matter, principally in relation to a &s;e&s;&s;ion of parlia|ment,
in which great things are propo&s;ed to the nation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To prevent the mi&s;chief of this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in the fir&s;t place,
that in all places hereafter to be filled, the King choo&s;e men having no
dependant, but on him&s;elf alone; and that, &s;o long as he is there in
per&s;on, he di&s;courages all dependance an any other to eclip&s;e him; but
in &s;uch a manner, as none can take exception ju&s;tly at.</P>
<P>The next thing is, by no means to have a &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament there,
having excu&s;es none can take exceptions at.</P>
<P>Pope Innocent the XI. died on the 12th of Augu&s;t, 1689. James
received the news of his death, in a letter from the cardinals, while he
was at Dundalk, offering battle to Schomberg.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers. D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 71.</NOTE> His an&s;wer to them,
then a&s;&s;embled in the conclave, is in the &s;tyle of a true &s;on of the
church, and dated from Dundalk, the 30th of September.</P>
<P>On the 6th of October, Alexander the VIII. was placed in the papal
chair. Lewis the XIV. who had renewed the war with the Emperor,
was de&s;irous of &s;ecuring the favour of the new pontiff, and a temporary
accommodation was made up between the courts of Rome and Ver&s;ailles,
by a tacit conce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the preten&s;ions on both &s;ides. Lewis
likewi&s;e advi&s;ed the Queen to &s;end Melfort to Rome, in quality of am|ba&s;&s;ador
from James, as mentioned by Melfort him&s;elf in the preceding
letters, and he furni&s;hed him with in&s;tructions, that he might not be
obliged to wait, until he received them from his ma&s;ter. The&s;e in&s;truc|tions
are among Mr. Nairne's papers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 68.</NOTE> and entitled, &startq;Memorial for the
earl of Melfort, going to Rome on the part of the King of Great Bri|tain.&endq;
Lewis believed it was nece&s;&s;ary, that James &s;hould have a mi|ni&s;ter
at Rome, in order to cultivate a good under&s;tanding with the
Pope, and to procure his holine&s;s's a&s;&s;i&s;tance in re-e&s;tabli&s;hing him,
and in preventing the entire abolition of the Romi&s;h faith in the
Briti&s;h empire. He thought Melfort well qualified to execute &s;uch
a commi&s;&s;ion, and furni&s;hed him with ample directions before he &s;et
<PB N="344" REF="362">
out on his emba&s;&s;y. He directed him to cultivate a good under&s;tand|ing
with the cardinals and mini&s;ters of France, who would have in|&s;tructions
to &s;econd him in his negociations; and particularly with cardi|nal
D'E&s;te, who might be of infinite &s;ervice, and had already given
&s;ufficient proofs of his attachment to the intere&s;ts of his Britannic Maje&s;ty,
which cardinal Norfolk, though his &s;ubject, had always neglected. He
de&s;ired him to repre&s;ent the low &s;tate of his ma&s;ter's affairs, and to
&s;hew the pope, that providence &s;eemed to have re&s;erved, for the ho|nour
of his pontificate, the mo&s;t glorious enterprize that could be un|dertaken
for the advantage of religion and the good of the church.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances, Lewis continued, were favourable. The prince
of Orange's tyranny had become in&s;upportable, even to tho&s;e who had
called him over. There was a &s;trong party for James in Scotland, in
England, and in Ireland; but it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport them. The
prote&s;tant princes were in a league to aboli&s;h the Roman Catholic reli|gion
(of which Lewis attempts to give proofs in Britain, Holland, Den|mark,
Sweden, and Germany). It was incumbent on the &s;ee of Rome
to employ all its authority, and even the trea&s;ures of the church, again&s;t
them. The prince of Orange, if he was once ma&s;ter of the Briti&s;h em|pire,
and the States General in conjunction, would endeavour to re|e&s;tabli&s;h
Calvini&s;m in France, and even to introduce it into Italy. The
prote&s;tant princes and &s;tates had deluded the Roman Catholic princes,
and met with no oppo&s;ition but from France. France was able to
defend it&s;elf, but the union of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria with prote&s;tant princes
could not fail to be prejudicial to the Roman Catholic religion.</P>
<P>Melfort &s;hould endeavour to per&s;uade the Pope, to bring the Empe|ror
and the King of Spain to the &s;entiments with which the danger that
threatened their religion &s;hould in&s;pire them; to unite the Roman Ca|tholic
princes in a league to re&s;tore a King, who &s;uffered merely for his
attachment to the religion of the holy &s;ee; to di&s;continue the &s;ub&s;idy
which his predece&s;&s;or gave to the emperor, and to employ it in a&s;&s;i&s;ting
the loyal &s;ubjects of the King of England, to drive away the u&s;urper of
his throne.</P>

<P>SO &s;oon as you &s;hall have received the&s;e our in&s;tructions and our let|ter
to the Pope, you &s;hall demand an audience of his holine&s;s, wherein
you &s;hall congratulate his exaltation to the holy chair, in our name; a&s;|&s;uring
him of our filial obedience, and that the rea&s;on of your not u&s;ing

we &s;uffer, upon the account of our religion, and the fears the pro|te&s;tants
had of its apparent progre&s;s, in our dominions; the violence of
the per&s;ecution again&s;t the Catholics, and the horridne&s;s of the u&s;urpa|tion
of the prince of Orange. That this affair is not only of import|ance
to us, but to the whole Catholic world. You are, therefore, to
demand his holine&s;s's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by endeavouring a peace among Catho|lic
princes; if not general, yet to di&s;unite as many as is po&s;&s;ible from the
prote&s;tant alliance, that &s;o our deare&s;t brother, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King,

<P>And, whil&s;t this is doing, you are to pre&s;s, that his holine&s;s may give

<P>You are to communicate, in all things, with the cardinal D'E&s;t&egrave;, our

<P>THE intelligences which come from England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 78. November.</NOTE> containing many things
of great importance, it is fit that extracts of them be punctually
tran&s;lated into French, and given to the French mini&s;ters, that they,
knowing the true progre&s;s of the King's affairs in England, may the more
readily join in the mea&s;ures which may be mo&s;t u&s;eful for the King; and
that the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King him&s;elf may the better judge of what is pro|po&s;ed
to him by your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to be &s;ome jarrings betwixt the prince of Orange and the
rebellious Scots, which it will be fit to foment; and, for that end, all
encouragement mu&s;t be given to &s;uch as will &s;tand up again&s;t him, they
promi&s;ing to adhere to the King's intere&s;t; and this being begun already,
mu&s;t be carefully continued, and the King's authority interpo&s;ed (if re|quired
by the&s;e Scots) or the Queen, till that can be had.</P>
<P>This beginning in Scotland will, no doubt, have great con&s;equences,
if the King's friends in England take the example, in that parliament,
<PB N="347" REF="365">
which is now a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> where a few re&s;olute members
might put a great &s;top to the P. of O. his proceedings, if not quite
defeat his de&s;igns, money being his great bu&s;ine&s;s. Many rea&s;ons can
be alledged to hinder it, and whatever is done on that head, is grateful
to the people, who love not to pay their money, now e&s;pecially, that
trade is low. Care, therefore, mu&s;t be taken to in&s;inuate this to all
the parties the King has in England; and money, &amp;c. mu&s;t be offered
to &s;uch as will appear in that affair.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons who can be&s;t manage this matter, are the&s;e from whom
the &s;everal intelligences come; &s;eeing that the parties know not of one
another, and that it is of importance to keep all their councils; and,
for this rea&s;on, &s;ome money mu&s;t be lodged in careful hands, for the
carrying on this work, be&s;ides what mu&s;t be employed in relieving &s;tarv|ing
pri&s;oners; which is a ju&s;tice and charity not to be forgotten, as far
as is po&s;&s;ible, con&s;idering the circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Clerk is not to be forgot, and tho&s;e of his gang; for,
though I have not his acquaintance, yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, that, as to his in|telligence,
he has done more than all the re&s;t together; and, therefore,
4 or 500 <HI>l.</HI> to be put in his hands, to be di&s;po&s;ed of for the King's &s;er|vice,
is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on that intelligence, and it
mu&s;t not be lo&s;t on any terms. Mr. Bel&s;ons is likewi&s;e of great u&s;e, and
he mu&s;t have &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, ju&s;t that he may live.</P>
<P>It is of importance, that what your Maje&s;ty does in the&s;e things be
only known to your&s;elf, and to &s;uch as Sir Robert Clerk and Mr. Bel&s;ons
tru&s;t: for there are &s;ome, whom your Maje&s;ty tru&s;ts, that the&s;e would
not; and they bearing the hazard, it is ju&s;t to humour them in this
manner. Of this, Mr. Innes can inform more particularly; and, &s;ee|ing
it is he who has been at the expences on this &s;ide, it will be &s;it that he
have ju&s;t as much as to reimbur&s;e him; and more he will not, at this
time, expect from your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>All imaginable in&s;tances mu&s;t be made, with the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King,
to get &s;ome way to tran&s;port the King into England; and, as argu|ments
ari&s;e, from the &s;everal intelligences from England, Scotland, or
Ireland, this mu&s;t &s;till be made u&s;e of to facilitate the matter, at lea&s;t,
again&s;t the &s;pring.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="366">
It will be mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee, if &s;ome of the Iri&s;h or French mer|chants
will carry arms into Ireland to &s;ell, for which they will get great
prices in the native commodity of that kingdom, to wit, wool, butter,
beef, &amp;c. by which an u&s;eful trade will be carried on to both nations
and much for the King's intere&s;t. The be&s;t way will be, for your Ma|je&s;ty
to cau&s;e &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial merchants be &s;poken with,
and pre&s;&s;ed to, as good &s;ervice for their own nation.</P>
<P>It will be mo&s;t fit to endeavour &s;ome &s;eparate relief for Scotland, be&s;ides
what goes into Ireland, as well to &s;hew the&s;e brave men, who &s;tand out for
the King, in de&s;pite of all di&s;couragement, that they are not forgot, as re|ally
to enable them to make a more powerful diver&s;ion again&s;t the &s;pring;
which, if it can be effectuate, will be of a va&s;t importance. If it cannot
be obtained from the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, it is of &s;uch importance, that it
will be fit for your Maje&s;ty your&s;elf to do &s;omething in it, even out of &s;uch
money as the King is to get from France. Great care is to be taken to
&s;uppre&s;s, as much as may be, the clamours, and indeed follies, of &s;ome
Iri&s;h at Paris, by letting them know the undutifulne&s;s of their proceed|ings,
and &s;ending &s;ome of the mo&s;t bu&s;y into Ireland. It will be ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome among&s;t them to inform of what pa&s;&s;es;
for this employment Mr. Sheridan is the mo&s;t proper man; and from
him may be got the mo&s;t &s;ecret of their intrigues and corre&s;pondences;
though, at the &s;ame time, great care is to be had not to believe what he
brings not good proofs for, e&s;pecially as to the fooli&s;h de&s;ign he men|tioned
to me of delivering up the kingdom; a thing would never be
accepted; and, be&s;ides, &s;o fooli&s;h and villainous in them, that I can|not
think it ever entered into their heads. If it has, they are only
&s;ome mad-men, and has fooli&s;hly been talking at random, and not any
men of &s;en&s;e or con&s;ideration. To find out this, Sheridan is to &s;hew
his proofs, but only to your Maje&s;ty: for the thing is &s;o fooli&s;h, and &s;o
undutiful, that it's of importance it go no farther.</P>
<P>I need not put your Maje&s;ty in mind how nece&s;&s;ary it is to free your
own family of any who may be &s;pies upon your actions. It is a mo&s;t
intolerable thing for us, who are private people, to be con&s;trained in
our families; and mu&s;t be much more trouble&s;ome to your Maje&s;ty,
who ought much le&s;s to be &s;ubjected to &s;uch hard&s;hips.</P>

It is, in my opinion, mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary that Mr. de Lauzun be made as
ea&s;y as is po&s;&s;ible to make him: for, if once there begin any jarrings,
they will have wor&s;e con&s;equences than any thing has yet happened;
and care mu&s;t be had of any preten&s;ions he may have, that the King
be informed of them; and that, from time to time, he gratify him in
&s;uch things as he may ju&s;tly pretend to; and, on the other &s;ide, the D. of
Tyrconnel would be precautioned not to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be led into
&s;uch little cabals as may di&s;order the King's affairs, and never end in any

<P>The preten&s;ions of the French, as to their ranks, mu&s;t be &s;ent over

and it's be&s;t doing it now, before the troops part from Bre&s;t.</P>

<P>Melfort arrived at Rome before he received King James's in&s;tructions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">December.</NOTE>
For the fir&s;t memorial which he pre&s;ented to the Pope was in the name
of the Queen. It is in Mr. Nairne's hand, and dated December 19th,
1689.</P>
<P>AFTER a complimentary preamble to his Holine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 79.</NOTE> Melfort begins with
a&s;&s;uring him, &startq;That there never was a King of England &s;o beloved
and &s;o obeyed by his people, as his Maje&s;ty, until it appeared by his
actions, that he was more zealous to gain a heavenly crown for his &s;ub|jects,
than careful to pre&s;erve an earthly one for him&s;elf. This and the
extirpation of here&s;y in France, gave &s;uch an alarm to the prote&s;tants
throughout all Europe, and even hell it&s;elf, that they put in practice
every means, however dete&s;table, to ruin the King, and with him all
tho&s;e who had the &s;ame &s;entiments of piety and religion.&endq;</P>
<P>This my&s;tery of iniquity, as Melfort calls it, mu&s;t, according to him,
without a &s;peedy remedy, be of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences to the Ca|tholic
<PB N="350" REF="368">
religion: but he &s;aves the pope the pain of hearing, and to him|&s;elf
the pain of repeating them, as it is &s;ufficient, that his Holine&s;s
knows that the King has been cha&s;ed from his kingdoms merely on ac|count
of his religion, and obliged to throw him&s;elf into the arms of the
only &s;overeign among his allies, who was not an accomplice in the prince
of Orange's de&s;igns. His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty has &s;o generou&s;ly a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
him, that he has been able to quell almo&s;t entirely the rebellion
in Ireland, by defeating Schomberg's army, and reducing it to its pre&s;ent
di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>From the &s;tate which Melfort gives of his ma&s;ter's affairs, he endea|vours
to &s;hew that his Holine&s;s can re-e&s;tabli&s;h him, if he will give an
immediate &s;upply of money, and bring about a peace among the Catholic
princes, who might then be per&s;uaded to a&s;&s;i&s;t in re&s;toring his Britannick
Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>&startq;The affairs of the King my ma&s;ter have nothing in common with
tho&s;e of the other catholic princes. He hath given no occa&s;ion to the
pre&s;ent war. It was merely his religion which alarmed the prote&s;tant
princes, and drew upon him his misfortunes. If he had been partial,
or formed alliances, as has been fal&s;ely &s;uppo&s;ed, his Maje&s;ty would
not be in the circum&s;tances in which he now finds him&s;elf; and if he
had not refu&s;ed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty offered to
him, he would have had no difficulty in repelling the violences of the
prince of Orange, and in curbing the in&s;olence of his &s;ubjects: but he
generou&s;ly refu&s;ed them, to avoid the partiality of which he hath been
&s;ince accu&s;ed, as guarantee of the peace of Nimeguen: and it is very
certain, that if the King my ma&s;ter had been in concert with his mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, the fir&s;t ho&s;tilities would not have commenced to|wards

<P>For the&s;e and other rea&s;ons, Melfort thinks the catholic princes will
be di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t his ma&s;ter. He adds a great many arguments in the
&s;ame &s;train, and concludes his long memorial with the&s;e words:</P>
<P>&startq;As for my&s;elf, I reckon it a happine&s;s to be at the feet of your
Holine&s;s; having nothing to &s;olicit, but the concerns of the King my
ma&s;ter, which are, at pre&s;ent, tho&s;e of your Holine&s;s; and, after hav|ing
endeavoured to di&s;charge my duty towards God and my King, al|though
<PB N="351" REF="369">
in a more weak and defective manner than another would have
done, that I have an opportunity of &s;oliciting for my&s;elf your Holine&s;s's
apo&s;tolical benediction.&endq;</P>
<P>It was probably at this time that Melfort, according to his in&s;tructions,
gave a memorial to the cardinal D'E&s;t&eacute;. It is marked at the top in his
hand-writing.</P>
<Q>A paper given to his &s;erene highne&s;s the cardinal D'E&s;t&eacute;.</Q>
<P>He begins with repeating,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 82.</NOTE> as in the preceding memorial, that his
ma&s;ter &s;uffered for his attachment to the catholic religion; and that be|ing
the cau&s;e of the holy See, and of the Pope, his Holine&s;s could not
avoid to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; which could only be done in two ways, by bringing
about a peace between the Roman Catholic princes, and by furni&s;hing
his Maje&s;ty with money. To open a congre&s;s for &s;uch a peace, his Holi|ne&s;s
&s;hould di&s;patch legates, who were well di&s;po&s;ed to the cau&s;e, to dif|ferent
courts. A &s;upply of money was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that very
&s;ea&s;on, to &s;ecure the &s;afety of Ireland, and accompli&s;h the reduction of
Scotland.</P>

<HEAD>AFFAIRS of SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES the Seventh, upon his acce&s;&s;ion, was addre&s;&s;ed by the Scoti&s;h
parliament, with expre&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t &s;ervile adulation, and with
promi&s;es of perpetual attachment to his per&s;on, and ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to his will. They acknowledged, in an act, &startq;That the ble&s;&s;ings the
nation then enjoyed were owing to the &s;olid and ab&s;olute authority with
which their Kings were inve&s;ted.&endq; They expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of all
principles which are contrary or derogatory to the &startq;King's &s;acred, &s;u|preme,
ab&s;olute power and authority;&endq; and they promi&s;ed to give entire
obedience to the King, &startq;without re&s;erve.&endq; They gave him convincing
proofs of the &s;incerity of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, by extending the laws of
trea&s;on, and obliging all the men in the nation, above &s;ixteen years of
age, to be in &startq;readine&s;s to attend the King, in arms, where and as oft
as he &s;hould require.&endq;</P>
<P>But the mea&s;ures of the new reign were not calculated to continue the
popularity with which it began. James compo&s;ed a new mini&s;try, con|&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="352" REF="370">
almo&s;t entirely of Papi&s;ts and non-conformi&s;ts. He gave new
commi&s;&s;ions to all tho&s;e who were in public &s;tations, without requiring
their compliance with the te&s;ts. He di&s;pen&s;ed with the execution of the
penal laws; and advanced Roman Catholics to many places of honour
and emolument in the kingdom.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures, and the unpopular character of &s;ecretary Melfort and
others, le&s;&s;ened greatly the affection of the people for James and his
government. Yet he had &s;till many friends among the Scots. When
the prince of Orange landed in England, he was invited by them, after
he retired to France, to return and join them. James, however, thought
it more for his intere&s;t to go to Ireland; and he contented him&s;elf with
writing a letter to the convention, which the prince of Orange had &s;um|moned
to a&s;&s;emble, at Edinburgh, in the month of March. His letter
was dated, after he had embarked, on board the St. Michael, the 1&s;t of
March, 1689. From Ireland, he &s;ent them the proclamation referred
to, in the journal he &s;ent to France by lord Dover. In the mean time,
his friends in Scotland, particularly the vi&s;count Dundee, were diligent
in increa&s;ing the number of his adherents.</P>
<P>Dundee, who had refu&s;ed to enter into the &s;ervice of King William,
came to the convention of e&s;tates, which had a&s;&s;embled, at Edinburgh,
on the fourteenth of March; but, finding he was de&s;erted by &s;ome who
pretended, at fir&s;t, to adhere to the cau&s;e of his ma&s;ter, and apprehending
there was a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him, he retired, at the head of a troop
of fifty hor&s;emen, who had de&s;erted to him from his own regiment,
then in England; and, having reconciled &s;ome of the Highland clans,
who had been quarrelling among them&s;elves, he began ho&s;tilities, with|out
waiting either for a commi&s;&s;ion or the &s;uccours which James had
promi&s;ed to &s;end him from Ireland.</P>

military operations, which was &s;ent to Ireland. It is called on the

<HEAD>&startq;News from Scotland with Mr. Hay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 49.</NOTE> Received July 7th, 1689.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>&startq;BY the la&s;t information, &s;ent by Mr. M'Swine, account was given how
the vi&s;count of Dundee parted from Edinburgh; how he &s;tayed at
his own hou&s;e for above a fortnight after, guarded by a party of 50 hor&s;e;
<PB N="353" REF="371">
and how,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> after a party of the Scotch dragoons came over to Dundee,
with a party of Mackay's foot, he marched towards Inverne&s;s, encou|raging
all per&s;ons to &s;tand out, letting them &s;ee, by his example, there
was no danger in it. The account was al&s;o given, how he went through
Murray, and was come back to Ca&s;tle-Gordon, when M'Swine was di&s;|patched.
After which, he marched to the Cairn of Mounth, de&s;igning
to go near Dundee, encouraged by the promi&s;es the Scotch dragoons
had &s;ent him, that they would declare for the King; but, by the way,
having intercepted a me&s;&s;enger of the ma&s;ter of Forbes, returning from
Edinburgh, found, by Mackay's letters, that he was to be at Dundee
that night, with 200 foot and a regiment of Engli&s;h hor&s;e; and they,
with the dragoons and the foot that came there before, were to pur&s;ue
him wherever he went. The lord vi&s;count waited at the Cairn of Mounth,
till M'Kay was within eight miles, and then marched back towards Ca&s;tle|Gordon,
(where the earl of Dunfermling, with 40 or 50 gentlemen, joined
him) and from thence through Murray to Inverne&s;s, where he found the
laird of Keppoch at the head of 700 men; the mo&s;t part volunteers.
They plundered M'Into&s;h's lands and the neighbourhood; which M'In|to&s;h,
in a manner, de&s;erved, becau&s;e the vi&s;count had written twice to
him, to declare for the King, and had got no return. The laird of Kil|ravock,
with 300 men, was on one &s;ide of Keppoch, and the town of
Inverne&s;s in arms on the other. The vi&s;count &s;ent to Kilravock to know
his de&s;ign. He profe&s;&s;ed loyalty, and &s;o was allowed to guard his coun|try.
The magi&s;trates of Inverne&s;s came and informed him, that Kep|poch
had forced them to promi&s;e him 4000 marks. My lord Dundee
told them, that Keppoch had no warrant from him to be in arms, much
le&s;s to plunder; but that nece&s;&s;ity had forced him out, and told he would
give his bond that, at the King's return, (&s;ince they had not yet declared
the prince of Orange King) they &s;hould have their money repaid them.
After which, he de&s;ired Keppoch to march his men with him, and he
would go and engage M'Kay. But the men, partly the Camerons, &s;aid
they could not, without con&s;ent of their ma&s;ter; but the truth was, they
were loaded with &s;poil, and neither they nor their leader had any thing
el&s;e in head; &s;o they went home plundering on the way.</P>
<P>The vi&s;count marched to Glengairi$, and &s;o into Badenoch, where,
con&s;idering the &s;ea&s;on was advanced towards the 8th of May, and the
<PB N="354" REF="372">
gra&s;s begun to appear, and having found the di&s;po&s;ition of the low
countries for the King, and received letters from mo&s;t of the chiefs of
clans of their readine&s;s, and being informed of the &s;ub&s;tance of bre|vettes,
letters, and commi&s;&s;ions, and finding that M'Kay was endeavour|ing
to rai&s;e Highlanders and others for to ruin and &s;uppre&s;s the King's
faithful &s;ubjects, before the e&s;tate of his affairs in Ireland would allow
him to come to their relief, the &s;aid vi&s;count re&s;olved to appoint a ge|neral
rendezvous, which accordingly he did, to be, the 18th of May, in
Lochaber, and acquainted all chiefs of clans; and, in the mean time,
M'Kay being at Inverne&s;s, he took occa&s;ion to &s;lip down through Athol,
to St. John&s;ton, where he &s;urpri&s;ed the laird of Blair, &s;eized him, his
lieutenant Pogue of that ilk, trumpet, &s;tandard, and all the troopers
that were in the town, with two lieutenants of M'Kay's, and two or three
officers of the new levies; mo&s;t of which are &s;ent to an i&s;land of the
M'Lean's, which is &s;aid to be like the Ba&s;s. After which, he went to
Dundee, thinking to gain the two troops of Scotch dragoons: but
could not prevail, becau&s;e of captain Balfour, who commanded them;
yet he forced them to leave Dundee, but could do no more, becau&s;e the
town was in rebellion, and the &s;treets barricadoed. He cau&s;ed &s;eize the
drums and baggage of the laird of Drum, and others of the earl of Mar's
officers, and cha&s;ed the lieutenant colonel, and might have &s;ei&s;ed whole
companies, but was not at the pains; yet frightened and &s;cattered them
&s;o, that they have not been heard of &s;ince. After which, having &s;ei&s;ed
300<HI>l.</HI> of ce&s;s and exci&s;e, the lord vi&s;count took his march through
Athol and Rannoch, up to Lochaber, to keep the dyet of the rendez|vous.
Glengairie kept the clay punctually, with betwixt 2 and 300
men (who, on all occa&s;ions, &s;hews him&s;elf a man of honour, &s;en&s;e, and
integrity.) Next came a very hone&s;t gentleman, the laird of Morer,
commanding all the captain of Clan Rannald's men, on the main land
near 200. Next came Appin and Glenco, towards 200. Sir Donald
M'Donald was expected, but was not ready. M'Lean gave account,
that he was ju&s;t coming; and, after having made the vi&s;count &s;tay &s;ix
days, Sir Alexander M'Lean, hearing his friends were in difficulties,
&s;ailed away to Kintyr, with his men and an hundred of M'Lean's: at the
&s;ame time M'Lean fell &s;ick. Lochiel came, with 600 men; Keppoch,
with 200; with which the vi&s;count marched into Badenoch, in ha&s;te, hear|ing
<PB N="355" REF="373">
that colonel Ram&s;ay was coming that way, with 700 foot, to join
M'Kay at Inverne&s;s; and, accordingly, Ram&s;ay having marched from
Edinburgh to St. John&s;ton, and near 40 miles up towards Ruthven in
Badenoch; but upon different news of my lord Dundee's coming, went
back and fore in the hill a whole night. In the end, he went back in
great confu&s;ion to St. John&s;ton. Several of his men de&s;erted. The
Athol men got together; and, by the prudence of the gentry, with great
difficulty, were hindered from falling on them. Ram&s;ay po&s;ted to Edin|burgh,
and got commi&s;&s;ion of fire and &s;word again&s;t Athol. About this
time, account was brought to Dundee, that M'Kay was within four
miles of him, with great numbers of Highlanders, Grant's men, M'In|to&s;h's,
Balnagown's, Rae's, Strathnaver's, and Monroe's, be&s;ide the
&s;tanding troops. On which, he cau&s;ed draw out all the men, and bid
them be gaining towards a very &s;trong ground, and &s;ent out a party im|mediately
to view the enemy, following it him&s;elf; having left orders
with Lochiel, that the body &s;hould not go above half a mile back.
However, when he returned, he under&s;tood that M'Kay had almo&s;t no
Highlanders, and was not there to fight, but to meet Ram&s;ay. He
found that all the troops had marched four miles back. However, he
made all ha&s;te to march to engage M'Kay: but, before he could come
to the place, M'Kay was &s;o far gone, that he could not be overtaken;
and being informed there, that Sir Donald and M'Lean were yet to join,
thought fit to wait; and, in the mean time, blockt up the ca&s;tle of
Ruthven, where M'Kay had put 50 of Grant's men in garri&s;on. After
&s;ome days, the ca&s;tle, wanting provi&s;ions, &s;urrendered; which being
burnt, and lo&s;t hopes of M'Lean, and fear of Ram&s;ay, my lord re|&s;olved
to engage M'Kay. But, &s;o &s;oon as he heard of the march to|wards
him, he di&s;lodged in the night. The vi&s;count pur&s;ued him four
days; and, by an unexpected way, came in &s;ight of him, an hour be|fore
the &s;un &s;et, and pur&s;ued them &s;o clo&s;e, that parties of the Highlanders
were within &s;hot of the rear-guard, clo&s;e to the main body, and dark
night came on; &s;ave which, nothing could have &s;aved them, in all hu|man
probability. The ground was dangerous, and the march had been
long; &s;o that the vi&s;count thought not fit to follow further, being within
three miles of Strathbogy, a plain country, where the hor&s;e and dra|goons
had too much advantage of the Highlanders. The next morn|ing,
<PB N="356" REF="374">
hearing M'Kay had marched 10 miles before he halted, the vi&s;count
lay &s;till all that day; but, being after informed, that Sir James Le&s;ly,
with his regiment of foot and another regiment of dragoons, had joined
M'Kay, and the officers of the Scotch dragoons having &s;ent to acquaint
the vi&s;count, that there was very bad news come of the duke of Ber|wick's
being pri&s;oner, and of a party's being beat back, that had endea|voured
to land in Scotland, and that they were &s;o &s;urrounded with Eng|li&s;h
hor&s;e and dragoons, that, if there was any engagement, they could
not &s;hun to fight; and, therefore, begged, that he would go out of the
way, for a time, till better news &s;hould come. On all which, the vi&s;count
thought &s;it to return to Badenoch. Mo&s;t of my lord Dumfermling's
people, &s;ave him&s;elf (who continued &s;till very fixt) and the duke of
Gordon's hor&s;emen, being wearied and near their own hou&s;es, went
home, without leave; the Highlanders thinking them&s;elves ma&s;ters, grew
very di&s;orderly, and plundered, without di&s;tinction, wherever they came.
The vi&s;count fell &s;ick, which gave boldne&s;s to the di&s;orderly and di&s;|heartened
others. The fir&s;t day he marched back, he made a long march,
M'Kay &s;ent a party of hor&s;e, who &s;eized &s;ome of the duke of Gordon's
gentlemen that went off, and &s;ome of the plundering &s;tragglers; but
never came in &s;ight of the rear-guard. The next two days, the vi&s;count
did not march &s;ix miles in all; and M'Kay's foot came not within ten
miles of his: but, in the evening of the la&s;t day, he &s;ent up a party of
200 hor&s;e and dragoons, who, led on by Grant, were brought upon a
party of the M'Leans, &s;cattered a mile a&s;under, &s;eeking meal. The
hor&s;e came up upon them at the full gallop, having got &s;ome adverti&s;e|ment.
About one hundred of them got together; and finding them|&s;elves
on a plain, they run near half a mile, till they gained the foot of
a hill, where they &s;tood and fired upon the enemy, who, in the di&s;order,
having killed two or three, and &s;eized their baggage, thought they had
nothing to do but knock them all down; &s;o got above them and &s;ur|rounded
them, which the M'Leans perceiving, threw by their guns,
drew their &s;words, attacked the enemy boldly, killed the Engli&s;h officers
that commanded, and eleven more, wounded many, and forced the re&s;t
to retire. Night being then come, the &s;cattered M'Leans joined the
re&s;t. My lord Dundee, marching towards them, the next morning early,
met Lochbuy and all his party, who had not lo&s;t above four of his men,
<PB N="357" REF="375">
and the baggage, and two old men and boys, who were with it. Then
the lord Dundee marched to Ruthven in Badenoch, where he learned,
that Ram&s;ay had come back, with 1100 foot and 100 hor&s;e, had pa&s;&s;ed
to Inverne&s;s; that my lord Murray had come up to Athol, had brought
the&s;e men together, and &s;aw Ram&s;ay &s;afe through. The next day, the
vi&s;count was further informed, that Ram&s;ay and M'Kay were joined
and marching towards him, and that there was come to St. John&s;ton
my lord Angus's regiment and other new troops, and to Dumblain more
of that kind, was re&s;olved to go to Rannoch, and &s;trong ground near the
low countries; but finding that the Lochaber men were going away
every night by fortys and fiftys, with droves or cattle, and finding all
the re&s;t loaden with plunder of Grant's lands, and others would needs go
home, gave way to it, and came into Lochaber with them, di&s;per&s;ed them
all to their re&s;pective homes, with orders to be ready within a few days,
if the enemy pur&s;ued. If not, to lay &s;till till further orders; and, in
the mean time, &s;ent adverti&s;ement to M'Lean, Sir Donald, the captain
of ClanRannald, and M'Leod, to make ready again&s;t the rendezvous, who
had not yet come forth. It's believed M'Kay was very glad of the oc|ca&s;ion,
his hor&s;e being extremely wearied, and &s;o retired to Inverne&s;s,
where, on &s;u&s;picion of corre&s;pondence, he &s;eized eight officers of the
Scotch dragoons and &s;ent them pri&s;oners to Edinburgh, with a guard of
300 Engli&s;h hor&s;e. The re&s;t of the hor&s;e and dragoons are quartered in
the adjacent places for conveniency of gra&s;s. Ram&s;ay, with 700 foot,
is &s;ent to Elgin, who &s;ummoned Gordon ca&s;tle to &s;urrender; upon
which Mr. Dumbar, and tho&s;e that were with him, immediately de&s;erted
the place. There were &s;everal hundred bolls of meal there, as well as
at Strathbogie. M'Kay, in the mean time, is cau&s;ing &s;eize all the meal
in the low countries, and gives it to the &s;oldiers landladies, in&s;tead of
ready money: for it is believed, they have not great abundance of it.
My lord Dundee hath continued in Lochaber, guarded only by 200,
commanded by Sir Alexander M'Lean; but being in the heart of Glen|gairy
and Locheil's lands, he thinks him&s;elf &s;ecure enough, though he
had not, as he has, the Captain of Clan Rannald with 600 men within
ten miles of him, and M'Lean, Sir Donald, and M'Leod, marching to|wards
him; &s;o that he can march with near 4000, or refre&s;h in &s;afety
till &s;uch time as the &s;tate of the affairs of Ireland may allow the King to
<PB N="358" REF="376">
&s;end forces to his relief; which, if it plea&s;e God &s;hall fall out, there is all
appearance of forming a con&s;iderable army. Notwith&s;tanding that, the
people are a little di&s;heartened, by the unexpected &s;urrender of the ca&s;tle
of Edinburgh, which is &s;aid was only by de&s;pair the duke had of any
relief, though he wanted not from my lord Dundee, by a third hand, all
the encouragement he could give.</P>

<OPENER>Mull, <DATE>June 2d, 1689.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>UPON Tue&s;day, the 21&s;t of May, Sir Alexander M'Lean embarqued
for the relief of the King's party in Kintyre. At his landing in the
i&s;land of Giga, where he found Mr. Neil of Clachalie, his lieutenant
colonel, with two companies of men, who gave account, that, two days
before, Lurip and he had endeavoured to &s;top the low country forces
from entering Kintyre; they had engaged near Clachan Killcalmanell,
and after facing others for two or three hours, and &s;ome party's firing,
Clachalie finding the rebels &s;till encrea&s;ing to more than four times his
number, he very hand&s;omely drew off his men, and came &s;afe to Giga.
Lurip took &s;hip for Ireland, without acquainting any with his de&s;ign;
and Lergie left the ca&s;tle of Skipnidge, and went for Arran. In this
action Clachalie lo&s;t one man, and the rebels &s;even. In this condition
Sir Alexander found the&s;e gentlemen, at his landing in Giga, and imme|diately
ordered boats to be prepared for &s;ecuring Lergie's &s;afe retreat to
him, and &s;ent him orders to come to the coa&s;t &s;ide of Kintyre, where he
&s;hould meet him; all which was performed before Friday night, the
27th. Upon Saturday blew a great &s;torm, &s;o that they could not come
to Giga, which they de&s;igned, to come in all ha&s;te to his Maje&s;ty's army
at Lochaber. Lergie gave an account, the rebels were 1500, preparing
<PB N="359" REF="377">
boats to invade Giga. Upon Sunday morning early, the wind continu|ing
to blow in the &s;ame<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Quarter.</NOTE> art, Sir Alexander perceives two men of war,
one frigate, and three or four long-boats, making from Ila towards
them, and &s;ome boats coming off from Kintyre to meet them. Upon
which, he and the other gentlemen di&s;po&s;ed their boats equally in two &s;e|veral
places, and encouraged their men to a brave re&s;i&s;tance, this being
their fir&s;t action. The two men of war did anchor clo&s;e within mu&s;ket|&s;hot
of both harbours, and had a full view of the &s;mall boats; the fri|gate
continued &s;till under &s;ail, from place to place, with a great long|boat,
and offered &s;everal times to land; but were always beat off. Thus
they continued, firing ince&s;&s;antly, from eight in the morning till eight at
night; about which time, the wind decrea&s;ing, Sir Alexander began to
carry away his boats to other places, and two contrary ways, the better
to delude the rebels, and give them the more to do, which was effected
with &s;o much courage of the &s;oldiers, that they carried away their boats,
through &s;howers of cannon and mu&s;kets, to the other end of the i&s;land,
where they embarqued all their men, and came to Argyle next morning.
In the action, the King's party lo&s;t one boat, and two &s;unk with cannon|&s;hot,
and one man only wounded. The rebels lo&s;t 13 of their men,
above 400 cannon-&s;hot, and their whole plot mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>Upon Monday, Sir Alexander having intelligence, that there was a
rendezvous of the rebels at Kill-Michal of Invereny, within five miles
of Gla&s;rie, he immediately makes towards them, for it was not much
out of his way; but, upon approach, they all fled. Sir Alexander,
with Elchille, encamped there that night, and &s;uffered the &s;oldiers to take
nothing but meat next morning. He continued, with as much expedi|tion
as po&s;&s;ible, to come up to my lord Dundee; and landed ju&s;t now
here, with the other gentlemen in the boats, and brought all his men
&s;afe to this place.</P>
<P>The &s;oldiers are hearty and eager to &s;ee my lord Dundee, and &s;uffer
hunger and want of &s;leep, with great patience, to come up, and are in
hopes to be tran&s;ported to Morven, to-morrow or Sunday.</P>
<P>Badinoch, the 4th June.&mdash;Ju&s;t now arrived here Sir Alexander
M'Lean, with Mr. Neal of Calchalic, and the laird of Lergie, where
they met his excellency my lord Dundee, on his way to Lochaber; who,
<PB N="360" REF="378">
thereupon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of his army to be refre&s;hed at home, keep|ing
only with him&s;elf Sir Alexander's party and a few hor&s;e, until news
from his Maje&s;ty and the next rendezvous. Three days ago, a party of
major general M'Kay's hor&s;e and dragoons, with &s;ix &s;core hor&s;e, fell upon
a party of M'Lean's men, commanded by Lochbuy, who was upon a
party, about half a mile from the army. The M'Leans took them&s;elves
to a hill, and lo&s;t their baggage in the retreat, whereupon they took their
ground and fell in pell-mell with the rebels, &s;word in hand, and broke
them, cha&s;ing them for a good way. In this notable action, the rebels
lo&s;t their chief officers, who were killed upon the place, viz. the cap|tain,
who was an Engli&s;hman of con&s;iderable note, and much regretted
by the rebels. His name we have not known as yet. Him&s;elf with a
lieutenant and 15 others were left dead upon the place; and the
M'Leans carried the hor&s;e and arms, &amp;c. to the camp. Lochbuy lo&s;t
five of his men.</P>
<P>Lochaber, June 23d.&mdash;Ye&s;ternight arrived at the camp, Mr. Hay,
from Ireland, with expre&s;s from his Maje&s;ty, which gave great joy to his
Maje&s;ty's army here. We have al&s;o accounts from &s;everal places, that
his Maje&s;ty's fleet have &s;ecured their coa&s;ts and have taken, or &s;unk, or
cha&s;ed all the rebels' &s;hips from hence. My lord Dundee is now draw|ing
his forces together again, and re&s;olves to march from this in a few
days.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>&startq;My Lord,</SALUTE>
Moy, in Lochaber, <DATE>June 27th, 1689.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I Was not a little &s;urprized to find, by yours, that my name has been
made u&s;e of, for carrying on de&s;igns again&s;t you. Mr. Carleton is
extremely in the wrong, if he &s;ays I gave him any commi&s;&s;ion to the
King, or warrant to &s;ay any thing to him, in my name. Earl Bredalbin
<PB N="361" REF="379">
&s;ent him to me, with a credential, which he de&s;ired me to burn &s;o &s;oon
as I had read it. I had never &s;een the man in the face before, nor
heard of him. He was not two hours in my company; and, when he
gave me account of his pretended bu&s;ine&s;s to Ireland, I di&s;liked mo&s;t of
it, as I &s;ignified to you, by M'Swyne; nor did I give him &s;o much as
a line with him, that I remember. I leave you to judge, if it be pro|bable,
that I would intru&s;t my&s;elf &s;o far to any in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as
to employ him in &s;o nice and dangerous a point as that is, of accu&s;ing
&s;o great a man, and &s;o much my friend as you are, to the King. If I
had any &s;uch de&s;ign, I would rather have tru&s;ted my&s;elf to the King,
and written frankly to him&s;elf. I will a&s;&s;ure you, all my endeavours to
lay you a&s;ide were only to your&s;elf. I thought my&s;elf bound in duty to
the King and friend&s;hip to you, not to di&s;&s;emble to you the circum|&s;tances
you &s;tand in with the generality of this country and many in the
neighbouring. Your merit and ri&s;ing fortune has rai&s;ed envy; your
favour with the King is crime enough with his enemies, and I am
feared, even with his ambitions friends, which I am &s;ure can never be
imagined to be one with me: for I can never have any preten&s;ions in
your way. Be&s;ides, you have contributed to all the con&s;iderable &s;teps of
my fortune; but I mu&s;t tell you, that be&s;ides the&s;e generals, there are
many pretend to have received di&s;obligations from you and others, no
doubt, with de&s;ign on your employment; yet the mo&s;t univer&s;al pretext
is, the great hand you had in carrying on matters of religion, as they &s;ay,
to the ruin of the King and country. I mu&s;t tell you, I heard a great
re&s;entment again&s;t you, for advi&s;ing the giving the bulls for the bi&s;hops,
and I am feared they them&s;elves believe it. You know what the church
of England is in England; and, both there and here, they generally &s;ay,
that the King of him&s;elf is not di&s;po&s;ed to pu&s;h matters of religion, or
force people to do things they &s;crupled in con&s;cience; but that you, to
gain favour with the&s;e of that religion, had proved and prevailed with
him, contrary to his inclination to do what he did, which has given his
enemies occa&s;ion to de&s;troy him and the monarchy. This being, as I
a&s;&s;ure you it is, however unju&s;t, the general opinion of the&s;e nations, I
thought, in prudence, for your own &s;ake as well as the King's, you
would have thought it be&s;t to &s;eem to be out of bu&s;ine&s;s for a time; that
the King's bu&s;ine&s;s might go the &s;moother, and all pretext be taken away
<PB N="362" REF="380">
for rebellion; and this only, in ca&s;e the King find difficulties in his
affairs: for I am obliged to tell you, that, if the people take umbrage
as to their religion, it will be, notwith&s;tanding of all the foreign aid,
a long war. But I think you may come over; and, when you have &s;een
the &s;tate of affairs on the place, and &s;poke with every body, you may
think what will be be&s;t for you to do. You de&s;ire me to recommend a
proper man to be &s;ecretary. You know it is hard to do. But, if you
really re&s;olve not to &s;eem to meddle, I would, were I you, advi&s;e the
King to employ one, to be turned out when things altered, would not
much di&s;oblige, or could have no con&s;equence. But I think I have &s;aid
enough, if not too much of this.</P>
<P>My lord, I have given the King, in general, account of things here;
but to you I will be more particular. As to my&s;elf, I have &s;ent you it
at large. You may by it under&s;tand a little of the &s;tate of the country.
You will &s;ee there, when I had a &s;een advantage, I endeavoured to profit
on it; but, on the other hand, &s;hunned to hazard any thing, for fear of
a ruffle: for the lea&s;t of that would have di&s;couraged all. I thought, if
I could gain time, and keep up a figure of a party, without lo&s;s, it was
my be&s;t, till we got a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which the enemy got from England every
day. I have told the King, I had neither commi&s;&s;ion, money, nor am|munition.
My brother-in-law, Albar, and my wife found ways to get
credit. For my own, nobody dur&s;t pay to a traitor. I was extremely
&s;urpri&s;ed, when I &s;aw Mr. Drummond, the advocate, in Highland habit,
come up to Lochaber to me, and gave account, that the Queen had
&s;ent 2000 l. &s;terling to London, to be paid to me for the King's &s;ervice,
and that two more was a coming. I did not think the Queen had
known any thing of our affairs. I received a very obliging letter from
her, with Mr. Crain; but I know no way to make a return. However,
when the money comes, I &s;hall keep count of it, and employ it right.
But I am feard, it will be hard to bring it from Edinburgh. When we
came fir&s;t out, I had but fifty pound of powder; more I could not get;
all the great towns and &s;ea-ports were in rebellion, and had &s;eized the
powder and would &s;ell none. But I had one advantage, the highland|ers
will not fire above once, and then take to the broad-&s;word. But I
wonder, above all things, that, in three months, I never heard from
you, &s;eeing by Mr. Hay, I had &s;o earne&s;tly recommended it to you, and
<PB N="363" REF="381">
told of this way by Inverlochie, as &s;ure, if you would not have &s;ent
expre&s;&s;es, we thought you would, at lea&s;t, have ha&s;tened the di&s;patch of
the&s;e we &s;ent. M'Swyne has now been away near two months, and we
know not, if the coa&s;t be clear or not. However, I have adventured
to advi&s;e Mr. Hay to return &s;treight, and not go farther in the country.
It would have been impo&s;&s;ible for him to get through to Edinburgh;
but there was no need. He came not here until the 22d, and they &s;ur|rendered
on the 13th. It was not Mr. Hay's fault, he was &s;o long a
coming; for there has been two Engli&s;h men of war and the Gla&s;gow
frigates among&s;t the i&s;lands, till of late. For the re&s;t of the letters, I
undertook to get them delivered. Mo&s;t of the per&s;ons to whom they are
directed are either put under bond, or in pri&s;on, or gone out of the king|dom.
The advocate is gone to England, a very hone&s;t man, firm be|yond
belief; and Athol is gone too, who did not know what to do. Earl
Hume, who is very frank, is taken pri&s;oner to Edinburgh; but will be
let out, on &s;ecurity. Earl Bredalbin keeps clo&s;e in a &s;trong hou&s;e he
has, and pretends the gout. Earl Errol &s;tays at home; &s;o does Aber|deen.
Earl Mar&s;hal is at Edinburgh; but does not meddle. Earl Lau|derdale
is right, and at home. The bi&s;hops, I know not where they are.
They are now the kirk invi&s;ible. I will be forced to open the letter,
and &s;end copies atte&s;ted to them, and keep the original, till I can find
out our primate. The poor mini&s;ters are &s;orely oppre&s;&s;ed over all. They
generally &s;tand right. Duke Queen&s;berry was pre&s;ent at the cro&s;s, when
their new mock King was proclaimed; and, I hear, voted for him, tho'
not for the throne vacant. His brother, the lieutenant general, &s;ome
&s;ay, is made an Earl. He has come down to Edinburgh, and is gone up
again. He is the old man, and has abu&s;ed me &s;trangely; for he &s;wore
to me to make amends.</P>
<P>Tarbat is a great villain. Be&s;ides what he has done at Edinburgh, he
has endeavoured to &s;educe Locheil, by offers of money, which is under
his hand. He is now gone up to &s;ecure his faction, which is melting.
The two Dalrymples and others again&s;t Skelmurly, Polwart, Cardro&s;s,
Ro&s;s, and others, now joined with that worthy prince, duke Hamilton.
M. Dougla&s;s is now a great knave, as well as bea&s;t, as is Glen|cairne,
Morton and Eglinton; and even Ca&s;&s;ills is gone a&s;tray, mi&s;led
by Gibby<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Burnet.</NOTE>. Panmure keeps right, and at home; &s;o does Strathmore,
<PB N="364" REF="382">
Southe&s;k and Kinnaird. Old Airly is at Edinburgh, under caution; &s;o
is Balcarras and Dunmore. Stormont is declared fugitive, for not ap|pearing.
All the&s;e will break out, and many more, when the King lands,
or any from him. Mo&s;t of the gentry on this &s;ide the Forth, and many
on the other, will do &s;o too. But they &s;uffer mightily in the mean
time, and will be forced to &s;ubmit, if there be not relief &s;ent very &s;oon.
The duke of Gordon, they &s;ay, wanted nothing for holding out, but
hopes of relief. Earl of Dumfermling &s;tays con&s;tantly with me, and &s;o
does lord Dunkell, Pitcur, and many other gentlemen, who really de|&s;erve
well, for they &s;uffer great hard&s;hips. When the troops land, there
mu&s;t be blank commi&s;&s;ions &s;ent for hor&s;e and foot for them, and others
that will join. There mu&s;t be a commi&s;&s;ion of ju&s;ticiary, to judge all
but landed men; for there would be examples made of &s;ome that cannot
be judged by a council of war. They take our people and hang them
up, by their new &s;heriffs, when they find them &s;traggling.</P>
<P>My lord, I have given my opinion to the King concerning the land|ing.
I would fir&s;t have a good party &s;ent over to Inverlochie, about
5000 or 6000, as you have conveniency of boats; of which, as many
hor&s;e as conveniently can. About 600 or 800 would do well; but ra|ther
more; for had I had hor&s;e, for all that yet appeared, I would not
have feared them. Inverlochie is &s;afe landing, far from the enemy, and
one may chu&s;e, from thence, to go to Murray by Inverne&s;s, or to An|gus
by Athol, or to Perth by Glencoe, and all tolerable ways. The
only ill is, the pa&s;&s;age is long by &s;ea and inconvenient, becau&s;e of the
i&s;land; but, in this &s;ea&s;on, that is not to be feared. So &s;oon as the boats
return, let them ferry over as many more foot as they think fit to the
Point of Kintyre, which will &s;oon be done; and then the King has all
the boats for his own landing. I &s;hould march towards Kintyre, and
meet at the Neck of Tarbitt, the foot, and &s;o march to rai&s;e the country,
and then towards the pa&s;&s;es of Forth to meet the King, where I doubt
not but we would be numerous. I have done all I can to make them
believe the King will land altogether in the We&s;t, on purpo&s;e to draw
their troops from the North, that we may the ea&s;ier rai&s;e the country, if
the landing be here. I have &s;aid &s;o, and written it to every body; and
particularly, I &s;ent &s;ome proclamations to my lady Errol, and wrote to
her to that purpo&s;e, which was intercepted and carried to Edinburgh
<PB N="365" REF="383">
and my lady taken pri&s;oner. I believe it has taken the effect I de&s;igned;
for the forces are marched out of Kintyre, and I am ju&s;t now informed,
M. G. M'Kay is gone from Inverne&s;s by Murray towards Edinburgh.
I know not what troops he has taken with him as yet; but it is thought,
he will take the hor&s;e and dragoons, except a few, and mo&s;t of the
&s;tanding forces; which, if he do, it will be a rare occa&s;ion for landing
here, and for rai&s;ing the country. Then, when they hear of that, they
will draw this way, which will again favour the King's landing. Some
think Ely a convenient place for landing, becau&s;e you have choice of
what &s;ide, and the enemy cannot be on both: others think the nearer
Galloway the better, becau&s;e the rebels will have far to march before
they can trouble you: others think Kirkcudbright, or thereabouts, be|cau&s;e
of that &s;ea for &s;hips, and that it is near England. Nobody ex|pects
any landing here now, becau&s;e it is thought you will alter the de|&s;ign,
it having been di&s;covered; and to friends and all, I give out I do
not expect any. So I am extremely of opinion, this would be an ex|treme
proper place, unle&s;s you be &s;o &s;trong that you need not care
where to land. The truth is, I do not admire their mettle. The land|ing
of troops will confound them terribly. I had almo&s;t forgot to tell
you that P&mdash;O&mdash;, as they &s;ay, has written to his Scotch council,
telling them he will not have his troops any more harra&s;&s;ed following me
through the hills; but orders them to draw to the we&s;t, where, he &s;ays, a
great army is to land; and, at the &s;ame time, gives them accounts, that
eight &s;ail of men of war is coming from Bre&s;t, with 15000 men on board.
He knows not whether they are de&s;igned for England or Ireland. I beg
you will &s;end an expre&s;s, before whatever you do, that I may know how to
take my mea&s;ures; and, if the expre&s;s that comes knows nothing, I am
&s;ure it &s;hall not be di&s;covered for me. I have told Mr. Hay nothing of
this propo&s;al, nor no man. If there come any party this way, I beg
you, &s;end us ammunition, and three or four thou&s;and arms of different
&s;orts, &s;ome hor&s;e, &s;ome foot. I have ju&s;t now received a confirmation of
M'Kay's going South, and that he takes with him all the hor&s;e and
dragoons, and all the &s;tanding foot; by which I conclude, certainly,
they are preparing again&s;t the landing in the We&s;t. I entreat to hear
<PB N="366" REF="384">
from you as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and am, in the old manner, mo&s;t &s;incerely,

<P>&startq;AFTER Mr. Hay was di&s;patched I was informed, that Achtera
and major Farchar's &s;on were landed, &s;o &s;ent and &s;topt Mr.
Hay and came down here to know what news they brought. I am very
glad to hear by your lord&s;hip's, that the King's affairs pro&s;per &s;o well and
that Derry will be &s;oon ours. But I hear it was not on Monday la&s;t. I
know not what the matter is; but I would think Mackay's going &s;outh
and the troops drawing back from Kintyre towards Edinburgh would
import &s;ome alarm they have got. I have &s;o often written over all that
Derry was ours, that now, &s;ay what I like they hardly believe, and
when I talk of relief out of Ireland, they laugh at it, though I believe
ere long they will find it earne&s;t, and then our enemy's confu&s;ion will be
great. As to the places of landing, I am &s;till of the &s;ame mind. For the
number I mu&s;t leave to the conveniency you have. The only incon|veniency
of the delay is, that the hone&s;t &s;uffer extremely in the low
countrys in the time, and I dare not go down for want of hor&s;e, and in
part, for fear of plundering all, and &s;o making enemys, having no pay.
I wonder you &s;end no ammunition, were it but 4 or 5 barrells. For we
have not 20 pound. As to your&s;elf, I have told you freely my opinion
and am &s;till of the &s;ame mind. You de&s;ire I may tell you your faults&punc;
I u&s;e to &s;ee none in my friends, and for to tell you what others find when
I do not believe them were to lo&s;e time. But I mu&s;t tell you many of
them who complained of you, have carried them&s;elves &s;o, that what they
<PB N="367" REF="385">
&s;ay de&s;erves not much to be noticed. However, they have poi&s;oned the
generality with prejudice again&s;t you, and England will, I am afraid, be
unea&s;ier to you than Scotland. It is the unju&s;te&s;t thing in the world,
that not being popular mu&s;t be an argument to be laid a&s;ide by the King.
I do really think it were hard for the King to do it; but glorious for
you, if once you be convinced that the nece&s;&s;ity of the King's affairs
requires it, to do it of your&s;elf and beg it of him. But this only, as I &s;aid
in my la&s;t, in ca&s;e of great difficulties, and in the way I advi&s;ed, which
I think the King will not refu&s;e you; I mean as to filling up of the
place; for the King may have enemys, &s;ome by your continuing; but
he may put in one who may ruin all, which I am &s;ure, if he gave it to
&s;ome that pretends, it would I am afraid certainly fall out. I wonder
you could have the lea&s;t thought that I would concert with any body
again&s;t you, having parted &s;o good friends. I &s;poke not to Dunmore
&s;ince he came from London. I mind not I &s;poke of you to Bredalbine.
I remember when I was endeavouring to make friends for the King in
the country and in the convention, many did tell me, that there would
be no living if you returned; &s;o when no arguments for you could pre|vail,
I have, may be, to &s;mooth them, &s;aid, that if all were well, you
would be prevailed with not to meddle any more. I would have
written letters of encouragement to all the King has written to from your|&s;elf,
and a&s;&s;ured them of your friend&s;hip and &s;atisfied them of your real
de&s;igns of living and letting live every one in their own way in matters of
religion, which would mightily allay, I think, as to Scotland, and let
them &s;ee you do favours to cavaliers and to Prote&s;tants, for &s;ome &s;teps,
that may be, you was forced to make in favours of the&s;e ungrate bea&s;ts
the Pre&s;byterians. You gave unhappy umbrage to both the other, but
they were fools; for never will they get one who&s;e family, education,
and inclination, is &s;o cavalier. They long at the King's re&s;toration to
have a Lauderdale to de&s;troy Middleton and poor &s;uffering cavaliers.
Let not this be their plague. I am &s;ure you &s;hall be &s;ure of all my en|deavours
for to bring the minds of people to rea&s;on. If you will allow,
I will &s;ay, that though you come to &s;ee the King once landed, you de&s;ign
not to &s;tay, unle&s;s you think that you may unbolden your enemys. I give

to Sir Alexander, that could not be brought near the &s;hore; but
they were &s;o warmly received by the King's party, that the rebels were
forced to retreat with lo&s;s, whereupon the two men of war dropped an|chor
as clo&s;e to the boats as they could come, and fired ince&s;&s;antly with
their cannon and &s;mall &s;hot from 8 o'clock in the morning until
8 o'clock at night. At which time Sir Alexander divided his boats, and
&s;ent one half of them round the i&s;land one way, and with them the
yaucht and &s;mall boats engaged. They being thus out of the way, and
the two men of war &s;till at anchor, all the re&s;t of the boats came out upon
them, and in de&s;pite of all tire Engli&s;h could do, they brought all &s;afe
away. In this &s;kirmi&s;h the loyali&s;ts lo&s;t one boat, and two &s;unk, and
one man wounded, but none killed. The rebels had a lieutenant and
14 men killed and a great many wounded.</P>
<P>The next engagement was in that &s;ame month, between a party of
Sir John M'Leane's regiment of 120 men, commanded by M'Leane of
Lochbuy, again&s;t 200 hor&s;e and dragoons, commanded by col. Living|&s;ton,
wherein the M'Leanes routed the rebels, killed captain Waine, an
Engli&s;hman, and 14 of his party, with the lo&s;s of five men only.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="387">
The battle of Rinrory, in Athol, was the next con&s;iderable engage|ment
after this, which was thus:</P>
<P>The lord Murray, &s;on to the marquis of Athol, having with 1500 men
laid &s;iege to the ca&s;tle Blair, in Athol, then garri&s;oned for the King
(thereof the lairds of $span$ and Ballechan were officers) and
my lord Dundee being to wait at Lochaber &s;ome days for colonel Can|non
and the Iri&s;h regiment and the other officers, who were come from
Ireland to come up to join him; his Excellency &s;ent orders for Sir Alex|ander
M'Leane (who was then at Cromar in the North, in an expedition
again&s;t the ma&s;ter of Forbes and other rebels) to march in all ha&s;te to
relieve the garri&s;on of Blair, and there to wait till his Excellency's arrival.
This Sir Alexander &s;o happily performed, that lord Murray was forced
to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and major general M'Kay being on his march to &s;e|cond
lord Murray, my lord Dundee (upon information thereof) made
long marches to prevent him, and arrived at Athol upon the 16th of
July, and next morning was informed, that M'Kay's forlorn of 400 men
were within two miles of the ca&s;tle, at the Pa&s;s of Kilikrankie. Where|upon
his Excellency commanded Sir Alexander M'Leane, with 400 men,
to march again&s;t this party. But they were not a quarter of a mile off
when his lord&s;hip was informed, that in&s;tead of a party, M'Kay him&s;elf
with all his army was at Rinrory, within a mile and a half of him.
Whereupon his lord&s;hip commanded the army to march towards the
rebels, re&s;olving, without delay, to fight them. M'Kay's army was drawn
up in eight battalions, con&s;i&s;ting of 4500 foot and two troops of hor&s;e. My
Lord Dundee's con&s;i&s;ted of 2500 foot and one troop of hor&s;e. On the
right wing Sir John M'Leane was placed with his regiment in two
battalions. On the le&s;t, was Sir Donald M'Donald's regiment, com|manded
by his &s;on and Sir George Berkley, in one battalion, and Sir Alex|ander
M'Leane another battalion, made the le&s;t wing. The main battle
con&s;i&s;ted of four battalions, viz. Lochiel's, Glengary, Clanronald, and the
Iri&s;h regiment, and the troop of hor&s;e commanded by Sir William Wallace.
The officers that came from Ireland divided them&s;elves among the bat|talions.
The fight began about 5 o'clock at night, Sir Alexander
M'Leane keeping the rebels in action (while my lord was forming the
battle). By debating for advantageous po&s;ts, therein he lo&s;t only five
men, but the rebels lo&s;s was greater. About 8 o'clock, the &s;ignal was
<PB N="370" REF="388">
given; his lord&s;hip, charged in per&s;on, upon the head of the hor&s;e. The
Highlanders gave &s;uch a furious charge as made the rebels give ground
in a moment. For the rebels having &s;pent their fire before the High|landers
fired, (who kept their &s;hot till they were within pike length of the
enemy), and after fire the royali&s;ts falling in with broad &s;words made the
rebels run. The left wing of M'Kay's army was quite routed by Sir
John M'Leane, who followed the &s;laughter for a good way. The like
was done by the main battle. But all the oppo&s;ition to purpo&s;e was in
the right wing of the rebels. For Sir Alexander M'Leane, having
routed M'Kay's regiment, his men followed the pur&s;uit &s;o bri&s;kly, that
he was left alone him&s;elf in the place of battle; and ob&s;erving colonel
Ha&s;ting's regiment of foot &s;tanding their ground again&s;t Sir Donald M'Do|nald's
regiment, and at la&s;t forcing them to retire, he rallied as many as
he could get of his men, and with Sir Evan Cameron made head towards
the rebels who thereupon fled, and the night put a &s;top to the
&s;laughter.</P>
<P>In this battle there were killed of the rebels upon the place 1500, &s;ome
&s;ay 2000, and the next morning 500 pri&s;oners were brought in by the
men of Athol. Tho&s;e of note killed, were brigadier Balfour, and lieu|tenant
colonel M'Kay, brother to the major general, with many more
officers of le&s;s note; of the pri&s;oners were lieutenant colonel Balfour,
captain Fergu&s;on, captain Donald&s;on, and 13 other officers, with all their
camp, tents, baggage, artillery, and provi&s;ions, which was of great
value, and al&s;o the prince of Orange's &s;tandard, carried by M'Kay's re|giment,
taken by Sir Alexander M'Leane.</P>
<P>Of the royali&s;ts were killed (to his Maje&s;ty's un&s;peakable lo&s;s) the
lieutenant general him&s;elf, (while he was riding to help the confu&s;ion he
ob&s;erved in the left wing, occa&s;ioned by the gallant re&s;i&s;tance of colonel
Ha&s;ting's regiment again&s;t Sir Donald and Sir George Berkley,) the lairds
of $span$ Largie, captain M'Donald, brother to Glengarie,
captain Ram&s;ay, captain M'Leane, nephew to Sir Alexander, captain
Pollock, brother to the laird of Pollock, and &s;ome other officers, but very
few common &s;oldiers. Sir George Berkley and &s;everal other gentlemen
were wounded.</P>
<P>Two days after this battle, colonel Cannon, who now commands the
army, &s;ent the laird of Struan with 100 foot and &s;ome hor&s;e, under the
<PB N="371" REF="389">
conduct of major William Graham, to St. John&s;toun, where they were
&s;urpri&s;ed by &s;ome troops of hor&s;e of Sir John Lanier's regiment. Major
Graham made off in time. But Struan's men were &s;ome in their beds, &s;ome
drunk, and &s;ome of them were killed, and 25 taken pri&s;oners; the re&s;t
with the laird him&s;elf made their e&s;cape. This was the beginning of
Cannon's conduct.</P>
<P>The la&s;t engagement was about 20 days after this, at Dunkell, where
there was &s;ome 800 of the Cameronians, under the command of colonel
Cleaveland and others. Colonel Cannon with the army arrived at Dun|kell
the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, at 7 o'clock in the morning, and &s;urrounded the
town, commanding Sir Alexander M'Leane to make the fir&s;t attack, and
&s;o the Highlanders fell on &s;o furiou&s;ly that they beat the rebels from the
walls, and helping one another over the walls entered the town. So that
at once the town was &s;et on fire both by them and the rebels, whereby
the town for an hour and a half was very hot on both &s;ides. At la&s;t all the
rebels being cut off, except tho&s;e who got into the ca&s;tle and the great
church, and the Highlanders having &s;pent their ammunition, retired out
of the town. In this engagement, on the rebels &s;ide were killed Cleave|land
him&s;elf and almo&s;t all their officers, and 120, &s;ome &s;ay 200, of their
men. On the King's &s;ide were killed two captains of M'Leane's regi|ment,
and Sir Alexander M'Leane's captain lieutenant, and &s;ome other
officers of note, but few &s;oldiers; but there were a great many wounded,
and Sir Alexander M'Leane had his leg broken with a mu&s;ket bullet, and
was carried to the ca&s;tle of Blair. But upon &s;ome di&s;ta&s;te taken by the
clanns at Cannon's conduct, the army broke up and went home; and
now they content them&s;elves with incur&s;ions, wherewith they have done
great prejudice to the rebels, and lately went within &s;even miles of Gla&s;|gow
and de&s;troyed Kilmarnock, &amp;c.</P>

<P>&startq;IT has plea&s;ed God to give your forces a great victory over the re|bels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, A. L. ubi &s;upra.</NOTE> in which 3-4ths of them are fallen under the weight of our

command in it; but of 5000 men, which was the be&s;t computation I
could make of the rebels, it is certain there cannot have e&s;caped above
1200 men. We have not lo&s;t full out 900. This ab&s;olute victory made

who &s;ucceeded to the command, was neither loved for his manner, nor

<OPENER>&startq;Dublin, the 14th day of March, 16 89/9$.</OPENER>
<P>&startq;ON the 20th of the la&s;t month, Sir George Berkley, Sir Alexander
M'Lane, colonel James Purcell, and Mr. John Hay, &s;et out from
Tubermurray, in the i&s;land of Mull and kingdom of Scotland, in his
Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Jennet (that carried major general Buchan thither)
for Sligo, in the we&s;t of this kingdom; but, meeting with contrary
winds, put into Killibeg, &s;hort of it; which, becau&s;e of the nearne&s;s to
Sligo, they believed was in his Maje&s;ty's hands; but &s;oon found their
mi&s;take. There were three of the enemy's &s;hips riding there; and the
Jennet had &s;carce anchored, when two of their boats came up to her.
In one were the ma&s;ters of the two &s;hips, their mates and &s;eamen; in the
<PB N="375" REF="393">
other, two fi&s;hermen only. The fir&s;t came on board and were &s;ecured;
the ma&s;ters in the cabin, and the men in the hold. The two fi&s;hermen
grew jealous, went off, and informed tho&s;e a-&s;hore, they &s;u&s;pected them.
Whereupon, one captain Wat&s;on, captain lieutenant to Tiffany, and
commander in chief of the place, manned and armed three boats very
well; re&s;olving, if enemies, to take them. They received the captain,
and tho&s;e in his boat, on board, and immediately di&s;armed them; which,
as &s;oon as the other two boats &s;aw, they fired upon the &s;hip. But his
Maje&s;ty, when the &s;hip went off from hence, having ordered a &s;ufficient
number of &s;oldiers on board her, to &s;ecure her in her return, they poured
&s;mall &s;hot &s;o thick into the boats, that one immediately cried out for
quarter. The other was rowed off by two boys, which made tho&s;e on
board the Jennet believe the men in it were killed or di&s;abled. They
took, in all, 19 pri&s;oners; two of which were &s;o de&s;perately wounded,
that their lives were de&s;paired of. After this &s;kirmi&s;h was over, the wind
blew fre&s;h into the harbour; but abated by twelve at night. Then,
with the help of the boats they took, they warped and towed out of the
harbour, which, in the entrance, is very &s;traight. Some &s;hots were made
at them, next morning, from the &s;hore, which did them no harm; and
a &s;mall gale pre&s;enting, they got off, and, in two days after, landed at
Broad-haven.</P>
<P>Mr. Hay, brother to Mr. George Hay, who was &s;ent expre&s;s to the
King by major general Buchan, di&s;patched immediately away, and ar|rived
here with his Maje&s;ty, on the $th in the morning. He brought
his Maje&s;ty two &s;everal letters from Buchan: the fir&s;t is of the 2d of
February at Mull; the la&s;t, of the 14th of the &s;ame month, at Inver|lochie.
In the fir&s;t, he gives an account of the favourablene&s;s of his
pa&s;&s;age thither; and that the officers, ammunition, cloaths, and money,
&s;ent with him, were &s;afely landed and &s;ecured by him: that he intended
to get a good body of men immediately together: that the duke of Ber|wick's
pre&s;ence there would be very nece&s;&s;ary; and de&s;ires, that the
lords Seaforth and Drummond, and all the Scotch to be &s;pared here,
might immediately be di&s;patched thither. In his &s;econd, he tells of a
meeting he has had with the general officers and chiefs of clans, in a
general council of war, (in pur&s;uance of his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion to
that purpo&s;e) where a general letter to his Maje&s;ty was conceived and
<PB N="376" REF="394">
&s;ub&s;cribed by them all, which he covered to the King. In it, they gave
fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances of their adherence to his Maje&s;ty and royal intere&s;t;
and promi&s;e to continue to do as they began, and expo&s;e their lives and
fortunes, and all that is dear and near to them, for his Maje&s;ty's re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment.
They be&s;eech his Maje&s;ty to &s;end the duke of Berwick,
with &s;ome hor&s;e and dragoons, to head them, which, they &s;ay, will
enable them to make a de&s;cent into the low lands, where they do not
que&s;tion to meet many of his Maje&s;ty's friends who will join them; and
add, that they have pitched upon Sir George Berkley, to give an ac|count
of their pre&s;ent condition, and de&s;ire he may be immediately &s;ent
back to them. The major general further adds, that he has already
had private me&s;&s;ages from con&s;iderable per&s;ons there, and de&s;ires com|mi&s;&s;ions
for colonels and lieutenant colonels of hor&s;e and foot, for &s;ome
noblemen he names, together with &s;ome blank ones for others. Be&s;ides
what he writes, and the general letter, his Maje&s;ty has had particular
ones from &s;everal of the chiefs of clans, which are full of dutiful and
loyal expre&s;&s;ions. Mr. Hay, that, &s;ome time before his embarking,
came out of the low lands, has brought the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment there,
as to civil and military employments, a li&s;t of the prince of Orange's
troops in that kingdom, the order of council for &s;eque&s;tring the e&s;tates
of the loyali&s;ts; and has given &s;o good an account of all things to the
King, that he has pitched upon him to carry his Maje&s;ty's letters to the
Queen, and &s;ets out for Cork this very day.&endq;</P>

<P>Many per&s;ons in Scotland who had declared early for the prince of
Orange, and acknowledged his title as King, expected exorbitant rewards
for their &s;ervices, but finding them&s;elves di&s;appointed, they began to make
their peace with James, and to concert mea&s;ures for his re&s;toration. The
Highlanders, when abandoned by colonel Cannon, who &s;ucceeded Dundee
in the command of the forfeited King's adherents, cho&s;e Sir Evan Cameron
of Lochiel for their commander; and, when reinforced by Buchan and the
officers whom James &s;ent with ammunition and provi&s;ions from Ireland,
<PB N="380" REF="398">
they took arms to &s;econd Sir James Montgomery's intrigues in parliament.
They were repul&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> rather than defeated, by Sir Thomas Living&s;ton in
the county of Murray, and by major Fergu&s;on in the i&s;land of Mull: and
the con&s;piracy in which Montgomery had engaged all the di&s;contented
nobility and gentlemen in the kingdom, was di&s;covered by him&s;elf to the
earl of Melvil; and by the earl of Annandale to Queen Mary. But
before this happened, the con&s;pirators had begun to corre&s;pond with the
exiled Queen in France, and with James in Ireland. The fir&s;t mention
made of their de&s;igns in Nairne's papers, is in the letters which Melfort
wrote to his ma&s;ter from Paris, and to the Queen from Toulon.</P>
<P>The Scots made certain conditions with James, and prepared to re|&s;tore
him in a parliamentary way to his kingdoms; and the mo&s;t rigid
Jacobites being under no re&s;traints from con&s;cience, made u&s;e of their
ma&s;ter's permi&s;&s;ion to qualify them&s;elves to vote in parliament, by taking
the oaths to the government. But it is probable that James placed no
confidence in the offers of the Pre&s;byterians; and Melfort, at this de&s;|perate
cri&s;is, was as anxious to avoid any conce&s;&s;ions which might imply a
diminution of the prerogative, as when his ma&s;ter was firmly &s;eated on
the throne of his ance&s;tors. He di&s;covers a great deal of this &s;pirit in
the following memorial, which contains, at once, proofs of in&s;incerity
and marks of weakne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Memorial concerning Scotland, &s;ent to the Queen from Rome, April 18th,
1690.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In Nairne's hand.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;HAving &s;een a paper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. 1. fol. No. 84.</NOTE> containing &s;ome propo&s;als for the bringing
back the kingdom of Scotland to their duties and allegiance to
his Maje&s;ty, I thought it my duty to make &s;uch reflections upon it, as
might be for the clearing of the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and the con&s;equences
of their demands; of which the &s;ub&s;tance is:</P>
<P>That it is mo&s;t certain, that the party now de&s;iring to treat, was that
party which gave the u&s;urper the crown, and have u&s;ed all the means
po&s;&s;ible to gain their ends with him. So that it is not kindne&s;s to the
King, but to play their own game better, which moves this offer; they
&s;eeing a church of England parliament, their mortal enemies, in all places
of tru&s;t about the u&s;urper, and per&s;ecutions coming on them, in&s;tead
<PB N="381" REF="399">
of that happine&s;s they propo&s;ed to them&s;elves by the change. But this
&s;hould be no hinderance, if their demands were tolerable, which, in
rea&s;on, the King might expect, con&s;idering that they have no re&s;ource
but in him; and that they mu&s;t be again&s;t the prince of Orange, it be|ing
their own intere&s;t, as well as his.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t demand of an act of indemnity, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary,
and to be as exten&s;ive as the King with &s;afety can make it; and
the&s;e exceptions propo&s;ed &s;eem to be mo&s;t rea&s;onable. But, be&s;ides the&s;e,
it is to be con&s;idered, that &s;uch as have formerly been pardoned for high
trea&s;on once, do not &s;eem fit objects for the King's mercy; nor &s;uch,
who&s;e families &s;eem to have been hereditably &s;o, except where, by &s;ome
new &s;ervice, they merit more favour; and this I do not find they &s;tick
at, to let the King make the exceptions; and I am of opinion there are
many who &s;hould be included for their lives and fortunes, who &s;hould
not as to their honour; that &s;o the King may, without augmenting the
number of the peers of every rank, have wherewithal to gratify &s;uch as
have eminently &s;erved him; and that exception of honours go to &s;uch
as have pretended to &s;erve him and did not, as well as to &s;uch as have
been his open enemies.</P>
<P>As to the propo&s;ition of a parliament, it &s;eems to be the mo&s;t dangerous
expedient in the world for the crown. All yet done is void and null, and
there is nothing can &s;upport it but a chain of force, as illegal and un|ju&s;t
as that which made it. But, if the King con&s;ent to a parliament,
whatever is there done, his commi&s;&s;ioners being there pre&s;ent, though
contrary to his in&s;tructions, though it will not be licit, yet will be va|lidly
done; and, therefore, it is not a right matter to name a man in
open rebellion to be a commi&s;&s;ioner. It is an act the King may do, but it
is not for any to advi&s;e him in it; and, be&s;ides, it would &s;eem too great
a conde&s;cen&s;ion for the King to make, for &s;o &s;mall a&s;&s;urances as he is
to have on their part, which amounts only to &s;imple endeavours, and &s;uch
as if the prince of Orange let not the parliament meet, their very fun|damental
project will be out of doors; it con&s;i&s;ting all in turning the
parliament into a convention.</P>
<P>The acts they propo&s;e are &s;uch as may &s;trengthen their authority with
the people, and may be a bait for them to catch at; and, I &s;uppo&s;e,
<PB N="382" REF="400">
they mean them for no other end at pre&s;ent; becau&s;e it &s;eems they
would print and di&s;per&s;e them. If that be all, then it would appear to
me, that a declaration of the King's, to a&s;&s;ure them what he will do for
them, may be as &s;ufficient as the in&s;tructions, and le&s;s dangerous. If
they intend to call a convention, without the prince of Orange's au|thority,
which they mu&s;t do, or have none, in all likelihood, then it
were fit, that they admitted the duke of Berwick, or earl of Perth,
whom, for that end, they may relieve, to a&s;&s;ure them of the King's in|tention,
&s;o &s;oon as he can &s;ee them, or &s;afely hold a parliament there;
and, in the mean time, to grant them the indemnity, liberty of con|&s;cience,
and &s;uch other things as may with &s;afety be done, leaving them
to rely on the King for &s;omething, as he mu&s;t on them for much hone&s;ty
and fidelity he mu&s;t pre&s;uppo&s;e them to have. And it is but rea&s;on|able,
that the&s;e who have broken all oaths and ties, &s;hould rather tru&s;t
to him, who has ever kept his truth, than that he, who has never failed,
&s;hould tru&s;t to them who have, and are his &s;ubjects too.</P>
<P>The acts are &s;uch as the King can give no in&s;tructions in, with any
&s;ort of &s;afety, till he &s;ee them.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t, That act for &s;ettling the prote&s;tant religion may be &s;uch, as
in con&s;cience the King cannot con&s;ent to. It may have clau&s;es in it,
which may de&s;troy the being of the monarchy or per&s;on of the King,
in ca&s;e of being any way, as they think, incroached upon by him. It
may give an authority to the people to inquire into the King's actions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e things, though they &s;eem a le&s;&s;er ill than what the King now
&s;uffers, yet I look on it as entirely greater. The violence of this u&s;urp|ation
threatens its being &s;hort-lived; and God, in his ju&s;tice, will throw
out the&s;e workers of iniquity, and, in his mercy, re&s;tore the King; and,
if he have not con&s;ented to any thing prejudicial to the monarchy, he
will get intire; whereas a conde&s;cen&s;ion once made, &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to
be retrieved again.</P>
<P>That act for not keeping up a &s;tanding army, is to put the King in
the people's power, which they have not u&s;ed &s;o in times pa&s;t, as to en|courage
the King to tru&s;t them in times to come; and for the King to
go on the&s;e terms, or not to go at all, &s;eems much the &s;ame thing, if
the fir&s;t be not by much the wor&s;t; and I am in the mind the King will
not conde&s;cend to it.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="401">
As that his Catholick &s;ervants &s;hould be approved in parliament,
that's of no con&s;equence to be &s;tuck at on any account. If it had been
&s;o &s;till, we had been more &s;ecure, and, in my judgment, the King had
been allowed whatever he had a&s;ked; but if that extend to officers, it
is of the nature of the other act, and the King I believe will never
grant it.</P>
<P>That Act, re&s;cinding all forfeitures &s;ince 1660, is again&s;t all law and
the &s;ecurity of the crown. For no man will dread any ju&s;t &s;entence.
But yet it &s;hould not be &s;tuck at, if it can help the King's bu&s;ine&s;s on.
It may have &s;uch exceptions in it, as may be fit that many of the King's
own friends may not be forfeited, in&s;tead of his enemies: a thing has ever
been aimed at, by the di&s;contented party, to make men weary of their
duty and loyalty. So that, to propo&s;e the matter right, they &s;hould
have &s;aid, at lea&s;t, The parliament giving compen&s;ation to &s;uch as &s;hall
be injured by &s;uch an act. Though, at the &s;ame time, I renounce all
intere&s;t I have in them, &s;o &s;oon as the King &s;hall let me know it is for his
intere&s;t I do it. But this act requires long time; for many forfeitures
are &s;old and many bought, by the relation of the per&s;on forfeited: &s;o
that it would require time to adju&s;t &s;uch an act, &s;o as to make it as ju&s;t
as can be; and it &s;hould be well adju&s;ted with the King's friends, le&s;t
they be alarmed by it and di&s;heartened; and &s;o like the fable of Ae&s;op,
we lo&s;e the &s;ub&s;tance aiming at the &s;hadow.</P>
<P>Let this gentleman &s;ay what he will, this is not only to hamper but to
fetter the King; and, therefore, the true con&s;ideration is, if the King be
in &s;uch a ca&s;e, as that he mu&s;t accept on any terms, which, according to
my weak capacity, he is not yet reduced to; and that, therefore, he
may very well propo&s;e his terms as they have done theirs, and ride the&s;e
gentlemen with a good bridle hand, not giving them too much reins,
le&s;t they run away with him and throw him again, nor too little, le&s;t they
choak and renver&s;e with him.</P>
<P>This riddle is what it requires mo&s;t wi&s;dom, and more experience
than I am ma&s;ter of to find out; yet I could not be wanting to give the
in&s;ight I can, for the &s;ervice of &s;uch as I e&s;teem above all worldly things;
and therefore I think:</P>
<P>That this party, being di&s;obliged by the prince of Orange, flys to the
King, and a&s;ks high terms. If they can get them, they gain; however,
<PB N="384" REF="402">
they lo&s;e nothing to propo&s;e them, though, at the &s;ame time, they mu&s;t
accept of what the King offers them, if that weighs down in one grain
what they expect from the prince of Orange. For a proof of this, they
have put their lives into the King's hands, without any precaution, which
they would not have done but in two ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, to cheat the King and get the&s;e conde&s;cen&s;ions, with the
prince of Orange's con&s;ent. This they are not in terms to effectuate;
and, therefore, it mu&s;t be the &s;econd: That they are &s;o ill u&s;ed, that
they think they were better before the prince of Orange came than they
are now; and, if that, then a &s;tate near about what they then enjoyed
will &s;atisfy them, in other demands they be never &s;o extravagant.</P>
<P>If, therefore, it be po&s;&s;ible for the King to &s;atisfy them with rea&s;onable
promi&s;es, and once to get them entered in action, they will do the King's
work, and whil&s;t the prince of Orange and they are &s;truggling for the
bone, leave the King the liberty of growing &s;trong enough to take it
from them both, and to give as he &s;hall &s;ee rea&s;onable afterwards. For,
if once they begin a war, it will not then be &s;o much minded, what
terms they are to expect from the King, who is to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, as how
they &s;hall overthrow the power of the pre&s;ent enemy.</P>
<Q>[What follows is in Melfort's hand.]</Q>
<P>Who gains time, gains life; and, therefore, the King &s;hould &s;hew
them all the kindne&s;s, all the tru&s;t, all the confidence in the world; write
mo&s;t affectionately to them, &s;eem to grant even more than he intends to
perform; but, in the mean time, delay, and a good rea&s;on of delay of
&s;uch acts as he cannot grant is, to &s;ee them penned and &s;ent him. Such
as he can grant, to a&s;&s;ure them of them with all chearfulne&s;s, and brag
extremely of what a&s;&s;i&s;tance he will &s;end them, and that they &s;hall have
all content. Naturally they are hot and unwarie, and not able to brook
the pre&s;ent pre&s;&s;ure of the prince of Orange, as appears by their unea&s;y
me&s;&s;enger's &s;tories; that they can hardly be kept in, and con&s;equently, if
encouraged by the King, will break out; which, once begun, and the
Highlanders adverti&s;ed to take the &s;ame opportunity, then all will be
pa&s;t their helping, and the King's promi&s;es be at his own di&s;po&s;al, at the
time and in the manner he &s;hall think fit. Be&s;ides the likelihood it may
&s;top the u&s;urper's de&s;igns upon Ireland.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="403">
But above all things, he mu&s;t promi&s;e favours to &s;uch, as &s;hall enter|tain
this matter, and that they &s;hall be in po&s;ts to &s;ee their people pro|tected,
&amp;c. whatever rea&s;ons to the contrary may be gathered from
their pa&s;t carriages.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to &s;end back this me&s;&s;enger contented to his
principals; and that he may be in&s;tructed in what may be of mo&s;t u&s;e to
begin with, as &s;eizing the ca&s;tles, a thing ea&s;y for them to do, by &s;ur|prize;
&s;eizing good ho&s;tages on the prince's &s;ide, &amp;c. God Almighty
in&s;pire the King, and &s;end him &s;uch as may be &s;erviceable to him in this
conjuncture; neither lo&s;ing all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his enemies, nor endan|gering
his royalty.</P>
<P>It appears from the following preamble of a declaration, that James
always expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf too ambiguou&s;ly to &s;atisfy even tho&s;e who had
formed a con&s;piracy to re&s;tore him to his throne.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, by &s;everal declarations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers, D N. vol. i. fol. No. 94.</NOTE> we have endeavoured to give
our good &s;ubjects all &s;atisfaction, as to the &s;incerity of our inten|tions,
for &s;ettling the nation in peace and pro&s;perity, hoping, thereby, to
have removed all apprehen&s;ions and fears of our invading their religion,
liberty, or property. But finding, by experience, that the &s;aid declara|tions
did not produce tho&s;e good effects we expected from them, but ra|ther
di&s;&s;atisfied the greate&s;t part of our people, although they contained
only the &s;ub&s;tance of &s;uch heads and propo&s;als as had, from time to
time, been offered to us by &s;everal very con&s;iderable per&s;ons and parties
of our &s;aid &s;ubjects (who did at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ure us, that, if we would
$onde&s;cend to &s;uch propo&s;als as they offered, and which were mentioned
in the &s;aid declarations, our re&s;toration &s;hould immediately follow); we,
therefore, upon mature con&s;ideration, are convinced, that the only &s;ure
way left to know truly the &s;en&s;e of the nation, and to &s;atisfy all parties,
will be, to defer the de&s;cending into particulars till we meet with the re|pre&s;entatives
of all our &s;ubjects in a free parliament; with whom we
promi&s;e, upon our royal word, to advi&s;e and readily to concur in all
things, that can, in rea&s;on, be expected from us, for the general &s;atisfac|tion
of our people, in all that may relate to their religion, liberty, pro|perty, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>1691.</HEAD>
<P>ALEXANDER the VIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1691. January.</NOTE> after he was advanced to the Roman
pontificate, wrote an affectionate letter to the late King of England.
He exhorted him to patience and per&s;everance, and promi&s;ed him the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of prayers and money for his re&s;toration. But he carried ne|poti&s;m
to as great a length as any of his predece&s;&s;ors, and probably
&s;quandered too much money in aggrandizing his own family, to be able
to &s;end any more effectual aid than chaplets and indulgencies to James.
He died on the 1&s;t of February, 1691, and on the 12th of July Innocent
XII. was elected in his room. This Pope is &s;uppo&s;ed, before the end
of his pontificate, to have been liberal to James; but it does not appear
that he &s;ent him &s;upplies at this time, as there is a blank in lord Mel|fort's
negociations at Rome. Since December, 1689, there are but two
of his memorials among Mr. Nairne's Papers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 83.</NOTE> The one is in Italian,
and marked on the back, &startq;The fifth memorial on the 2d of March.&endq;
The year is not mentioned. The other is in French and in Italian, and
it is marked on the back of the Italian copy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 80, 81.</NOTE> that it was delivered to the
Pope (Innocent the XII.) on the 22d of Augu&s;t, 1691. In both the&s;e
memorials he a&s;ks money, and recommends a peace among the Roman
Catholic princes, in the &s;ame &s;train as in his memorial of December
1689.</P>
<P>By this time James had recalled lord Melfort from Rome; for the
letter he wrote then to Innocent is dated the 30th of July 1691.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 85.</NOTE> He had
higher expectations now, from the divi&s;ions among his old &s;ubjects at

<HEAD TYPE="sub">&startq;Memorials from Mr. Fergu&s;on.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>&startq;THERE is an impeachment de&s;igned again&s;t the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;|bury,
bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, and dean of St. Paul's, in parliament, for
per&s;uading the clergy to take the oaths to the prince of Orange as a con|queror.</P>
<P>Another impeachment de&s;igned again&s;t my lord Danby, for declaring
no King could reign in England, whil&s;t the act of <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> was in
force, and a great in&s;trument for the clergy's taking the oaths as above
written. There is many of the King's friends would gladly have the
general exci&s;e to pa&s;s freely in parliament, in hopes that the King may
come to the receiving of it. There are others of his Maje&s;ty's friends of
another opinion, that the le&s;s money granted in parliament is a good
way to the breaking of the confederacy. The parliament will have an
exact account of the money already given, and how it was &s;pent. There
are &s;everal of the King's friends, that are much of the opinion, that,
when it &s;hall plea&s;e God that the King &s;hall land in England, immedi|ately
after or about the time of the landing, the loyali&s;ts in London or
thereabouts join all in a body, attack his guards, and &s;eize the prince of
Orange and prince&s;s, with &s;ome of the head rogues in their government,
and bring them &s;treight to the King's camp. That the ce&s;&s;ation of arms,
made by the earl of Bredalbin and major general Buchan, with the re&s;t
of the officers and heads of the clans, was both honourable and advan|tageous
for the King's &s;ervice; but that lord is not to be tru&s;ted by no
<PB N="389" REF="407">
King, further than his own intere&s;t leads him. It is a very nece&s;&s;ary
thing, that &s;peedy &s;upplies be &s;ent to the Highlands, both to the officers
and clans. It will take air and &s;pread, that there is &s;ome care taken of
tho&s;e poor &s;ouls, that hath been in a manner &s;tarving for want of things
fitting for mankind, and will be a great encouragement to the low coun|try
in order to their duty. It is very proper 2000 l. be &s;ent to them,
with &s;ome other nece&s;&s;aries. Bre&s;t is the place, which is thought fitte&s;t
for tho&s;e wants to be &s;ent from; and to land on the i&s;le of Sky, or i&s;land Donald.</P>
<P>That the King come not in per&s;on to Scotland; but to &s;end the duke
of Berwick and my lord Dumbarton, with 10,000 men, with arms and
furniture for 5000 hor&s;es and dragoons more, and 10,000 &s;tand of arms
for foot.</P>
<P>That no con&s;iderable &s;um of money be &s;ent to Scotland to a poor no|bility,
that will undoubtedly quarrel about the dividing of it. But when
the army is &s;ent, to &s;end money with it, and put it into a tru&s;ty com|mi&s;&s;ioner's
hands, that will employ it for the u&s;e of the army, and will
be an&s;werable for it.</P>
<P>My lord Dumbarton is very fit for this expedition, his lord&s;hip
being generally beloved by all the people in Scotland, &s;ince he la&s;t com|manded
there, and qua&s;hed that rebellion with &s;o little blood, and is
very much beloved in England likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Arran to command as third lieutenant general. He an&s;wers, body
for body, for Argyle and Athol.</P>
<P>It's proper Athol, Hume, and Argyle, have the characters of lieute|nant
generals. It's a feather in their hats, to make them more forward
to rai&s;e their men conform to their character.</P>
<P>If the King could land in England, with 15,000 men, either in the
We&s;t, about Lanca&s;ter, or in the North, he will be joined by more than
the number he brings along him; and, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, march
peaceably to Whitehall.</P>
<P>The author of tho&s;e memorials will be as &s;oon on hor&s;e-back, as any
man in England with his printer.</P>
<P>The King's friends are very confident that there &s;hall be a very fair
fire about him in parliament; and, if he &s;hould take Danby in his arms,
<PB N="390" REF="408">
they will pull him out; that it's not in their power to protect him; and
it's a&s;&s;uredly known, that Halifax or Roche&s;ter will &s;ucceed.&mdash;The King's
friends de&s;ire to know, which of the two his Maje&s;ty mo&s;t de&s;ires to fill
his place. There is many, that is come in to the King's intere&s;t, that he
hath not power to name their names as yet; but will do it as &s;oon as he
hath their leave. Sir Charles Owe&s;ley is come intirely into the King's
intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange is mortally hated by the Engli&s;h. They &s;ee
very fairly, that he hath no love for them, neither doth he confide in
them; but all in his Dutch. It's certainly known he hath brought over
a great many foreigners this &s;ummer, and it's not doubted but the par|liament
will not be for foreigners to ride them with a cave&s;on; and its
mightily in their heads, that tho&s;e foreigners were brought over to noo&s;e
the parliament. He is cur&s;ed daily, by tho&s;e of his council, his bed|chamber,
and others that hath very good employments under him.</P>
<P>The &s;tory of Sir William Sharp being with the prince&s;s of Orange and

impo&s;&s;ible that they could be ea&s;y until they were both on the other &s;ide,
meaning France, and only there to remain &s;till to prevent further
jealou&s;ies.</P>
<P>Some months before I came from England, Sir James Montgomerie
a&s;ked Mr. Fergu&s;on's advice to take employment under the prince of
Orange, that he might be in a better condition to &s;erve the King. Mr.
Fergu&s;on told him, he &s;hould never give his advice to any &s;uch thing,
and further told me, that Sir James had been with the prince&s;s of Orange
quietly, and from that time until my coming into France, they never had
any meeting.</P>

<P>KING James had lo&s;t the battle of the Boyne in July, 1690, and
before he arrived in France the Scoti&s;h and Engli&s;h con&s;pirators had
been &s;eized, and the French King had entirely relinqui&s;hed his project of
invading Britain. It was re&s;umed, however, from time to time. The
enemies of William and of his government, were continually offering
their &s;ervices to the excluded King. An inva&s;ion of Britain was repre|&s;ented,
as the infallible means of re&s;toring James to his kingdoms, and
of continuing the progre&s;s of the French conque&s;ts in Flanders. Be&s;ides
the 5000 Iri&s;h which James &s;ent to France, by the tran&s;ports that carried
back an equal number of French troops into Ireland; there were 14,000
of the &s;ame nation &s;ent over next year, at the expence of the Engli&s;h
government, according to the capitulation which general Ginckle had
granted to them, upon the &s;urrender of Limeric. Before they arrived,
Lewis XlVth began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of an inva&s;ion, and having de&s;ired
the opinion of James, received the following memorial. It is in the earl

<P>&startq;YOUR Maje&s;ty,&endq; &s;ays James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1692. January.</NOTE> &startq;having a&s;ked ME, if the employ|ing
the troops expected from Ireland to make a de&s;cent in Scot|land,
would be the means of diverting the arms of the prince of Orange,
it appears to me, to be a thing very practicable. And your Maje&s;ty
having de&s;ired me to propo&s;e what I think nece&s;&s;ary for that de&s;ign, I
&s;hall, leaving always to your Maje&s;ty to determine what you think fit,
make the following propo&s;als.&endq;</P>
<P>His propo&s;als were, that the French King &s;hould &s;ecretly provide a
fleet and tran&s;ports. Be&s;ides the troops that were to come from Ireland,
he &s;hould employ a requi&s;ite number of HIS troops, which were already
in the French &s;ervice, and provide arms and hor&s;es for 500 troopers and
1000 dragoons. That he &s;hould &s;end arms for 2000 hor&s;e and 1000 dra|goons,
to equip &s;uch as were ready to take arms upon the fir&s;t notice of
HIS landing, and the nece&s;&s;ary number of arms for the infantry, which
might be rai&s;ed in the low country. That a train of artillery, however
&s;mall, was nece&s;&s;ary, with warlike &s;tores, provi&s;ions, and money, for a
&s;pecified time.</P>
<P>When the&s;e things were prepared, the be&s;t place from which they
could embark, appeared, he &s;aid, to be Bre&s;t, Bellei&s;le, or Rochfort, and the
be&s;t rout through the Iri&s;h channel to the firth of Clyde. Its vicinity to
the town of Gla&s;gow, the goodne&s;s of the anchorage, and the plentiful|ne&s;s
of the adjoining country, rendered between Air and Irvine the mo&s;t ad|vantageous
place for landing. But if the prince of Orange, by his vigi|lance,
which was not probable, &s;hould prevent their landing there,
Dumbarton was the mo&s;t proper place. The army &s;hould march with
the greate&s;t di&s;patch to Edinburgh, in order to publi&s;h the King's au|thority
and a&s;&s;ume the government; a mea&s;ure which would elevate the
&s;pirits of the royal party and di&s;hearten the rebels.</P>
<P>In the mean time, care &s;hould be taken to encourage HIS friends, as
well in England as in Scotland, to put them&s;elves in a condition to be
u&s;eful upon that occa&s;ion. The Highlanders &s;hould be warned to be
in readine&s;s to take arms on the fir&s;t notice; and HIS friends in the low
country &s;hould have notice to be in a condition to do him the be&s;t &s;er|vice,
but with that &s;ecrecy which the importance of the affair required.
<PB N="396" REF="414">
His friends in England &s;hould likewi&s;e be warned to &s;eize the fir&s;t fa|vourable
opportunity, on the fir&s;t notice of good news, of a&s;&s;embling
where they could maintain them&s;elves with &s;afety and make the greate&s;t
diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>That the troops, if &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;hould march immediately into England,
and join the loyali&s;ts of that kingdom. That his friends in the North of
England, &s;hould be warned to &s;eize Newca&s;tle, not only on account of
the riches of that commercial city, but becau&s;e London could not &s;ub|&s;i&s;t
without the coals which it &s;ends thither. That if Plymouth, or any
other place of &s;trength, could be &s;eized in England, the French King
&s;hould &s;end 4 or 5000 men to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in order to made a con&s;ider|able
diver&s;ion to the arms of the prince of Orange.&mdash;&startq;I am of opinion,
that, if this affair is prepared with the &s;ecrecy, and executed with the vi|gour
it ought, though it may fail to &s;et ME upon my throne, yet it can|not
mi&s;s to divert entirely the arms of the prince of Orange for this cam|paign,
and con&s;equently fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of the allies.&endq;</P>
<P>James at the &s;ame time pre&s;ented a memorial to the French King,

them with great probability of &s;ucce&s;s, and I cannot doubt, but
your Maje&s;ty may put to &s;ea before the enemy, if you apply from this

<P>&startq;That your Maje&s;ty, having taken precautions for having the troops
de&s;tined for this attempt, near Ambleteu&s;e, and a number of tran&s;ports

over the army to the county of Kent, in England, about the Downs or
near Dover; and, having landed them there, &s;hould remain in the
Downs or behind the Godwin &s;ands, to hinder the Engli&s;h and Dutch
from joining together, and even the Port&s;mouth &s;quadron from joining
with that of the Thames. Your Maje&s;ty may inform your&s;elf of the
facility of all this, by the &s;ea officers who know the place.&endq;</P>
<P>James having &s;hown how all nece&s;&s;ary preparations may be made with
&s;ecre&s;y and &s;ucce&s;s, and the tran&s;ports a&s;&s;embled and troops embarked
with great facility, proceeds to &s;pecify their number.</P>
<P>&startq;The number of troops I have propo&s;ed, is from 25 to 30,000 men,
comprehending 3,000 hor&s;e or dragoons; all my friends having all
along acquainted me, that with that number I &s;hall &s;ucceed. But if I
come with a &s;maller, I &s;hall run a great ri&s;que of not being joined by the
Engli&s;h, who, in that ca&s;e, will wait for the i&s;&s;ue before they will hazard
them&s;elves. Whereas, on the contrary, if they &s;ee me at the head of &s;uch
a good army, they will not he&s;itate to join me immediately upon my
landing.&endq; He &s;hows that he could ea&s;ily be furni&s;hed with &s;uch an army,
con&s;idering the number of his own &s;ubjects which are in the French &s;er|vice;
and that this attempt would be made before the campaign could
be opened in Flanders, where the enemy would be obliged to wait till
forrage was ripe, and where they could not attack France &s;o vigorou&s;ly,
if he once landed in England.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="416">
&startq;What I propo&s;e to do, after landing in England, is to march directly
to Roche&s;ter, which is but fifteen leagues from the places which I have
named above for landing, and to &s;eize there on the &s;tores of the fleet and
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hips of war, which will remain in the river, and
of which there will be a greater or &s;maller number, according as your
Maje&s;ty's fleet &s;hall be ready before the enemy; and having Roche&s;ter in
my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall have the wives, children, and hou&s;es of a great
number of the officers and &s;ailors of their fleet, which will hinder them
from acting again&s;t me with the &s;ame vigour, and will render your Ma|je&s;ty's
fleet more &s;ecure in its &s;tation.</P>
<P>&startq;From Roche&s;ter there are but ten leagues to London; and I know
from experience, the con&s;ternation and terror which will reign in that
city, upon the approach of an ho&s;tile army. They will &s;urrender them|&s;elves
by deputation before I come near them, if the prince of Orange
has not an army &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e mine, and to keep the city
at the &s;ame time; which he cannot have, as he has not left in En|gland
but 12,000 men, of which 5000 are nece&s;&s;ary for the garri&s;ons,
and there is no likelihood, that he will withdraw any of his troops from
Flanders, &s;ince he has no idea that a de&s;cent in England is po&s;&s;ible, as it
has not been made the preceding years.&endq; He likewi&s;e infers William's
imaginary &s;ecurity at home, from his having hired 400 tran&s;ports, not to
carry troops to Flanders, but, as he gave out publickly, to make a de&s;|cent
in France.</P>
<P>&startq;The nearer I approach to London, the more I &s;hall be ma&s;ter of the
Engli&s;h fleet, becau&s;e the wives, children, and hou&s;es, of the &s;ea officers
and &s;ailors, are in all the little towns round about; and when they know,
that I have in my hands all that is mo&s;t dear to them, they will not fight
again&s;t my intere&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;If I can make my&s;elf ma&s;ter of London, (which has never yet
re&s;i&s;ted, when it was attacked, even by an army of but 5 or 6000 men),
I do not deceive my&s;elf, when I imagine, that the re&s;t of England will
not make a long re&s;i&s;tance; &s;ince it is certain, that in London, all the
men of quality, all the good hou&s;es of the nobility, all the rich mer|chants
of the kingdom, have &s;o much intere&s;t, that I &s;hall have in my
hands very good pledges of their fidelity.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="417">
&startq;I do not deceive my&s;elf by my intelligence from England, though
they are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, concerning the number or rank of my friends;
and I do not depend much on the troops which are promi&s;ed me at my
landing, although their number is not &s;mall, nor upon the officers and
&s;oldiers of my old army, who would not be employed under the prince
of Orange, of which the number in London amounts to &s;ix thou&s;and.
But what I think of importance is, that, throughout all England, there
are ten who would not take oaths of f$delity to the u&s;urper, to one who
has taken them, and who choo&s;e rather to pay the penalties than to take
them; and of whom I can form no other judgment, than that being rich
they do not choo&s;e to hazard their e&s;tates by corre&s;ponding with me. They
mean to &s;how me their number in this manner, which co&s;ts them only a
little money, and that they are ready to join me, the fir&s;t favourable op|portunity
they can find.&endq;</P>
<P>James labours, in the next place, to &s;how, that this inva&s;ion will be of
great benefit to France. That it will di&s;&s;olve the league of the allies,
who are enabled to carry on the war &s;olely by the money of England, and
the Engli&s;h can never become poor by the continuance of it, while they
are ma&s;ters of the &s;ea by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Dutch, and carry on
a flouri&s;hing trade. He then proceeds thus, to give other arguments for
the inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;It is impo&s;&s;ible to form a rea&s;onable conjecture of the Engli&s;h na|tion,
from what the parliament does now, as two thirds of it are com|po&s;ed
of the officers of the court, of the fleet, of the revenue, and of the
army, which augments jealou&s;ies and di&s;contents again&s;t him (P. O.)
among the people. This is favourable for me.</P>
<P>&startq;It is a thing very remarkable, that a de&s;cent in England was never
un&s;ucce&s;sful, when he who made it carried an army with him, and no one
ever had &s;o much ju&s;tice nor &s;o con&s;iderable a party before him in
England, as I have.</P>
<P>&startq;England appears powerful, when carrying on a war abroad under
an u&s;urper, but will appear weak, when attacked by its lawful &s;overeign
at home. The rea&s;on is, that the u&s;urper compo&s;es his army of friends,
who are faithful to him; and even all his enemies are obliged to contri|bute
to his &s;trength again&s;t their inclinations, until I go to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
But if I once &s;how my&s;elf, then the number of my friends would appear,
<PB N="400" REF="418">
and the di&s;proportion between tho&s;e who acknowledge the prince of
Orange, and tho&s;e who are loyal to me; and the moment I &s;et my foot
a&s;hore in England, the prince of Orange would have neither money nor
ammunition, nor any of tho&s;e things from thence, with which he fur|ni&s;hed
his army in Flanders la&s;t year; and it would be &s;oon &s;een, that the
great force which he has now, would in&s;tantly vani&s;h, when I had once
cut off the &s;inews of war, that is to &s;ay, deprived him of the money which
&s;upports it.&endq;</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this memorial is addre&s;&s;ed to the vanity of Lewis.</P>
<P>Lewis, convinced by the rea&s;onings of James, permitted him&s;elf to be
buoyed up with hopes of a &s;ucce&s;sful inva&s;ion, and James and his
&s;ecretary were employed in concerting the plan. There is a copy of it
among Nairne's manu&s;cripts written by Lord Melfort, with &s;ome little

<HEAD>&startq;A memorial delivered to the King of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 97.</NOTE> the 27th January, 1692.&endq;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Tran&s;lation. The Original is in Melfort's hand.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;IT is now &s;ome time &s;ince I gave your Maje&s;ty a memorial concern|ing
a de&s;ign which might be formed again&s;t the prince of Orange
in England. I doubt not but your Maje&s;ty has con&s;idered it. I am
confirmed in the &s;ame &s;entiments, by &s;everal gentlemen &s;ent expre&s;s from
England to intreat me, in the name of my faithful &s;ubjects, not to lo&s;e
this opportunity, when the forces of the prince of Orange &s;hall be out
of the kingdom.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To convince me, they &s;ay that the humours of the Engli&s;h in ge|neral
are changed; for, in&s;tead of treating me injuriou&s;ly, as they for|merly
did, every one complains of my fate publickly, except tho&s;e who
depend immediately upon the u&s;urper; and even of them, a great num|ber
do not fail to do &s;o in private, when they find any of my friends to
whom they can &s;peak.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That, at fir&s;t, the prince of Orange was beloved. But that now he
is much hated and de&s;pi&s;ed; and that they publickly &s;peak ill of him
every where.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That his army is di&s;&s;atisfied, having been very ill paid; and that
the fleet is &s;till more &s;o, having demanded their pay, in a very mutinous
manner: and that the di&s;content is &s;till greater, &s;ince he refu&s;ed their
reque&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That a great part of the army will come to join ME, if I had where|with
to maintain them as they are in the &s;ervice of the prince of Orange.
<PB N="409" REF="427">
But that, at all events, &s;ome will come: that the church of England
and the non-conformi&s;ts are the two great parties of which the kingdom
of England is compo&s;ed: that the non-conformi&s;ts are near the half of
them, and entirely for me; becau&s;e the prince of Orange has di&s;obliged
them. Although they had a great hand in the revolution, yet, neverthe|le&s;s,
they have not been employed by him &s;ince: that they remember it
was I, that gave them liberty of con&s;cience: that I would never con&s;ent
to abandon them to the per&s;ecutions of the church of England; and
that they will find their intere&s;t in my re-e&s;tabli&s;hment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The church of England, which compo&s;es the oppo&s;ite party, forms
more than the half of the nation. But they are divided into tho&s;e who
have not taken the oaths for the prince of Orange, and tho&s;e who have
taken them. Tho&s;e who have not taken them, are entirely in my in|tere&s;t;
and, moderately &s;peaking, form more than three-fourths of the
church of England: for there are &s;ome who will have them to be nine|tenths.
The&s;e have &s;ent to offer me money for my urgent nece&s;&s;ities in
England; which they declare to be a great proof of their zeal, and of
their hopes that I may be &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The party which have taken the oaths are again divided into tho&s;e who
have taken the oaths from motives of affection to the prince of Orange,
and tho&s;e who have taken them in order to live at peace, and who have
explained them away at the &s;ame time. The&s;e la&s;t will be for me, when
the occa&s;ion offers.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They &s;ay, that if it had not been for the troops which the prince
of Orange has in England, and the militia which are in the hands of his
creatures, they would cha&s;e him from England infallibly. But the
troops, which are between &s;ix and eight thou&s;and men, joined with
the militia, which, otherwi&s;e, is good for nothing, are &s;ufficient to hinder
the King's friends from uniting; and, be&s;ides, though they are tired
of their pre&s;ent government, the Engli&s;h are &s;o much at their ea&s;e, that
there are but few among them who will ri&s;que their fortunes and their
lives, without &s;eeing a body of troops &s;ufficient to give them hopes of
conquering; and then the friends, and even the officers of the prince of
Orange &s;wear, that they will not &s;uffer a civil war in the kingdom, and
they will join me as quickly as they joined the prince of Orange on
his arrival.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="428">
&startq;They &s;ay, that the people are generally di&s;&s;atisfied, &s;eeing that there
is no end of their mi&s;ery. For if the war continues, they will be &s;ub|jected
to heavy taxes; if the peace was made, they will be &s;laves.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That an univer&s;al de&s;ire of my re-e&s;tabli&s;hment appears among all
good men. They call it univer&s;al, becau&s;e there are but very few who
depend upon the prince of Orange, that do not declare, in public and in
private, that it is their de&s;ire. They intreat me not to lo&s;e this &s;ea&s;on;
becau&s;e there are no hopes of having another like it. For, if the prince
of Orange &s;hould obtain any advantage, which God forbid, the Engli&s;h
would be &s;o intimidated, as not to dare to undertake any thing again&s;t
him. If, on the contrary, he &s;hould receive any con&s;iderable check, he
would draw back his troops to England; and then it would be nece&s;&s;ary
to conquer by force, which is no ea&s;y matter. Whereas, on the con|trary,
I could now remount my throne, as it were, without &s;triking a
blow, in ca&s;e your Maje&s;ty would &s;end me over &s;uch an army as I &s;pe|cified
in my la&s;t memorial.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They a&s;&s;ure me, that the naval force of the Engli&s;h will not be
near &s;o &s;trong this year as the la&s;t: that it will not be at &s;ea before the
month of June: that the ve&s;&s;els will be ill equipped and very rotten:
that the maritime is a corps very much divided in their intere&s;ts, and
without any union among the officers; and the &s;ailors make frequent re|flections
upon the difference between their treatment now and in my
time.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That all the land army will be in Flanders; and that there will not
remain in England but very few troops, even not &s;ufficient to garri&s;on
the forts; and that there will not be &s;uch numbers in Flanders as they
give out: that the Engli&s;h and Dutch begin not to love one another
&s;o well now as formerly; and that the prince of Orange, by preferring
the Dutch, had &s;hagreened the Engli&s;h in &s;uch a manner, that they
openly &s;peak ill of him, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among them
will not &s;erve him any longer.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All this is &s;o firmly believed by my friends in England, that they
think it impo&s;&s;ible we can be ignorant of it here; and they blame me,
as if it was my fault, that I do not come to their relief.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They &s;ay, that the earl of Danby boa&s;ts, that he has found means of
&s;upporting the prince of Orange, who&s;e prime mini&s;ter he is; which is, to
<PB N="411" REF="429">
&s;end all the troops abroad, to attack your Maje&s;ty, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
allies; judging of the future by the pa&s;t, that you will not attack them
at home, without obtaining &s;ome con&s;iderable advantage abroad. This
has put it out of their power to make any re&s;i&s;tance at home.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Although there is a difference between the accounts which emi&s;|&s;aries
give me of the number and rank of my friends, &amp;c. yet they all
agree, that if I could land in England with, at lea&s;t, five and twenty
thou&s;and men, I would become ma&s;ter, without difficulty, in the pre|&s;ent
conjuncture.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As all this depends upon the time which the fleet will be ready to
fail; and as it is of the utmo&s;t importance to ME, that I &s;hould not be
deceived, and that my friends &s;hould not flatter them&s;elves in that re|&s;pect,
which would be of infinite prejudice to your affairs, and the en|tire
ruin of mine, I intreat your Maje&s;ty to &s;end two or three, who may
inform you of the truth of all that regards the naval preparation; and,
if you find the conjuncture favourable, I doubt not but you will re&s;olve
to fini&s;h this war, by a blow the mo&s;t glorious and advantageous which
can be &s;truck.&endq;</P>
<P>The following letter, in Melfort's hand, has no addre&s;s. But it
appears to have been &s;ent to &s;ome Dutch man in the French intere&s;t.
It is intituled on the back,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 96.</NOTE> and at the top, in Nairne's hand, <HI>&startq;Lord
Melfort's reflections on the affairs of England, in a letter, dated the</HI> 8<HI>th
February,</HI> 1692.&endq; It &s;hews what arguments Melfort employed, to vin|dicate
the conduct, and promote the intere&s;ts of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>HE begins with ob&s;erving, &startq;That James wanted only to govern by
the laws, as interpreted by the ordinary judges; having never taken
any &s;tep, without their explicit or implyed con&s;ent; and, as he was
obliged, in the private concerns of his con&s;cience, to tru&s;t him&s;elf to
eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and, in the concerns of his health, to phy&s;icians, he had
nothing to do in the concerns of law, but to tru&s;t him&s;elf to men of the
profe&s;&s;ion; and they never advi&s;ed him to any thing, without &s;hewing
to him, at the &s;ame time, examples of &s;imilar in&s;tances in the conduct
of his predece&s;&s;ors, who were &s;overeigns of his kingdoms: and it is very
evident, that the di&s;pen&s;ing power is nece&s;&s;ary, as the parliament of
<PB N="412" REF="430">
England has not condemned it &s;ince the prince of Orange u&s;urped the crown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE></P>
<P>&startq;His Maje&s;ty found his people, in a great mea&s;ure, langui&s;hing un|der
the yoke of a &s;evere per&s;ecution, which tended rather to inflame the
rage of particular mini&s;ters, than to unite them, in matters of religion;
and, to remedy this evil, he granted a liberty of con&s;cience to all with|out
exception; as he wanted that virtue and vice, and not different &s;en|timents
of religion, &s;hould be the di&s;tinctions to determine his favour.
This irritated the church of England again&s;t him.</P>
<P>&startq;His Maje&s;ty con&s;idered the great advantage of which it would be
to the church of England, that the Roman Catholic youth &s;hould not
be &s;ent, for their education, to foreign countries, which carried annually
con&s;iderable &s;ums abroad; and de&s;igned to have a college or cla&s;s for
tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed that religion; imagining that that would le&s;s alarm
the Prote&s;tants, than to mix Roman Catholics with Prote&s;tants in each
college, by his own mandate, as he might have done without &s;cruple,
by the laws of the kingdom. His Maje&s;ty was &s;o far from intending
to accompli&s;h all this by force, that his de&s;ign was to have it confirmed
by act of parliament, in order that every one might live in peace.&endq;</P>
<P>Melfort &s;ays, he thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the fallacy of the
other charges again&s;t his ma&s;ter, as the prince of Orange did not at|tempt
to prove any of them, though he was obliged to do &s;o by his
declaration; and that, though Charles the Second was guarantee of the
peace of Nimeguen, his brother was not obliged to a&s;&s;ume that cha|racter,
unle&s;s he found it was his intere&s;t. He endeavours to &s;how,
upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that James, as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his brother, was obliged
to guarantee the peace HE had made, that that prince had done every
thing which his allies could in equity require of him.</P>
<P>&startq;With regard to the States-general, he was &s;o thoroughly per&s;uaded
of their &s;incerity, that, notwith&s;tanding he was convinced it was rea&s;on|able
to arm, con&s;idering the great armament which was preparing in
Holland, yet he would never believe that that armament was intended
again&s;t him; becau&s;e mon&s;ieur Van Citters, the amba&s;&s;ador of the States,
&s;wore to him, in the name of the States, that they were determined to
maintain the treaty of alliance inviolable; and that they could not even
<PB N="413" REF="431">
think of an action &s;o ba&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE> as to attack their ally, without the lea&s;t
rea&s;on of complaint. His own innocence, and his good opinion of the
States, hindered him from entering into that &s;alutary alliance, into which
he might have ju&s;tly entered, with his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and for
which he has been &s;o much blamed by the allies; though it is very cer|tain,
that he is ruined, becau&s;e he did not conclude it, and tru&s;ted &s;o
much to the States-general.&endq;</P>
<P>Melfort ob&s;erves, that the prince of Orange dared not attempt to
prove the &s;purious birth of the prince of Wales, though he obliged him|&s;elf,
in his declaration, to do &s;o, &startq;and ju&s;tly,&endq; &s;ays he; &startq;for we were,
to the number of &s;ixty-&s;ix or &s;ixty-&s;even per&s;ons, in the Queen's apartment
at her delivery; the greate&s;t part of which were prote&s;tants, and even
the neare&s;t to the Queen's per&s;on; and they have all te&s;tified, upon oath,
what was indeed clear as day-light, that the prince of Wales is the
Queen's &s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>Melfort infers from all this, that it was not the conduct of James and
his Queen, but the ambition of the prince of Orange and of his own
children, which has been the cau&s;e of their misfortunes; and that his
conduct toward the States general in particular, was always blamele&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;It is certain, that the King never intended to overturn the govern|ment
of the States; and, although letters have been counterfeited, of
which &s;ome copies were &s;ent to my&s;elf from Holland, it is certain, that
his Maje&s;ty was always of opinion, that it was as much a heinous trea&s;on
in the prince of Orange to u&s;urp any thing over the States, his lawful
&s;overeigns, as in a &s;ubject of England to u&s;urp any thing over his King;
which Balconier, pen&s;ionary of Am&s;terdam, might te&s;tify, if he was
alive.&endq; Melfort hopes, from the&s;e and &s;everal other rea&s;ons that the
States will, at length, act prudently. &startq;For it is evident, that the
King will be re e&s;tabli&s;hed, in &s;pite of men and devils; and it will de|pend
upon him to revenge the injustices which have been done him.
But ht will be much better plea&s;ed to have rea&s;on to commend the
friend&s;hip and repentance of the States, however late, than to revenge
their per&s;idy in the time pa&s;t.&endq; Mel&s;ort labours, through the remaining
five pages of this letter, to convince his corre&s;pondent, that it is the in|tere&s;t
of the States to humble the prince of Orange, and to contribute
to the re&s;toration of his rival.</P>

<P>&startq;AT the &s;ame time that I &s;ail for England, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to

than that which I have in England, yet it is nece&s;&s;ary to encou|rage
them well, in order to induce them to ri&s;e in arms, again&s;t a corps
of troops which are already in arms, and the fortified towns which
are in the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>&startq;What I propo&s;e is, to &s;end them two frigates, with officers, arms,
amunition, and money to be employed for rai&s;ing men.</P>
<P>&startq;As to the number of arms, it is certain that the more that can be
&s;ent, the better. But, not to propo&s;e any thing difficult, it will be
proper to &s;end them two thou&s;and fu&s;ees, &s;ix hundred pi&s;tols, two hun|dred
fu&s;ees for dragoons, three hundred bridles, &s;addles, &amp;c. two thou|&s;and
two hundred belts, &amp;c. according to the number of &s;u&s;ees, and
amunition in proportion, for three months.</P>
<P>&startq;The money to be &s;ent &s;hould be two thou&s;and pi&s;toles, at lea&s;t,
with which they may make a great bu&s;tle, and, con&s;equently, a con|&s;iderable
diver&s;ion; and, thereby, acquire reputation to my affairs in

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the per&s;ua&s;ions of James, and even the inclina|tion
of Lewis to comply with them, the French fleet was not ready
early in the &s;pring. James did not leave St. Germains till the twenty|fir&s;t
of April; and he was detained, by contrary winds, four weeks upon
the coa&s;t of Normandy.</P>
<P>While he remained at that place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D N. vol. $. fol. No. 19.</NOTE> he addre&s;&s;ed a letter &startq;to the officers
and &s;eamen on board our fleet, which is at &s;ea, or going to &s;ea, by or|der
of the u&s;urper, the prince of Orange.&endq; It is dated, at Queneville
in Normandy, the twelfth of May, 1692. There are likewi&s;e, among
Mr. Nairne's papers, copies of different. &startq;Projects of a declaration
for La Hogue,&endq; by the earl of Melfort. A &s;hort account of one of
them, which is in Nairne's hand, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>James declared he had no de&s;ign of a conque&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 104.</NOTE> He brought only
&s;uch an army as he was de&s;ired to bring by all ranks of his &s;ubjects,
and which was too &s;mall to give jealou&s;y. He was re&s;olved to call a
free parliament, to e&s;tabli&s;h the peace of the nation by its advice, and
a thorough liberty of con&s;cience by its authority. He would protect the
church e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and fill up all vacancies with the mo&s;t de&s;erving
men of its communion. If, after e&s;tabli&s;hing liberty of con&s;cience, the
parliament judged any further laws nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of the
church, he would con&s;ent to them, and never di&s;pen&s;e again with any
laws relating to religion. As a proof of the future lenity of his reign,
he offered a full pardon and indemnity to &s;uch of his &s;ubjects as, after
a certain day, &s;hould declare for him, &startq;excepting &hellip;&hellip; and &s;uch
others of our &s;ubjects, as our parliament &s;hall think fit to except; by
which we are re&s;olved to be advi&s;ed in this matter; re&s;olving not to
<PB N="416" REF="434">
follow the dictates of our own ju&s;t re&s;entment, but &s;uch mea&s;ures and
methods of law as they &s;hall advi&s;e us, for the weal of our people; re|&s;erving
always our undoubted right of pardoning even the wor&s;t of of|fenders,
if they &s;hall do what may merit it from us.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;ummoned all his good &s;ubjects to take arms and to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, by
bringing the prince and prince&s;s of Orange, and their abettors, into his
power, or by driving them out of the kingdom. He promi&s;ed his pro|tection
to &s;uch &s;trangers as declared for him. &startq;But to tho&s;e who &s;hall
remain ob&s;tinate again&s;t us, we &s;hall &s;hew the treatment due to invaders of
a lawful King, without declaring war, under the command of one who,
being a &s;ubject him&s;elf, had no power to declare it.&endq; By no other
means, he affirmed, but by re&s;toring him to his throne, could his people
hope for an end of the mi&s;eries which they had drawn on them&s;elves, by
too ea&s;ily believing the calumnies which were invented by his enemies,
and which they were not able to prove. The legitimacy of his &s;on, the
prince of Wales, could not, he &s;aid, be a que&s;tion. His Queen be|ing
then with child, and near her time, gave him hopes of another; and
he was always &s;ure of the powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his deare&s;t brother and
mo&s;t generous ally, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King.</P>
<P>While James was taking all the mea&s;ures which prudence could &s;ug|ge&s;t

he &s;ent Sir John Lytcott to Rome, to obtain &s;ome money from the Pope.
Lytcott corre&s;ponded with the earl of Melfort, about his journey and
the object of his emba&s;&s;y, from the 21 &s;t of April to the 5th of Augu&s;t,
1692.</P>
<P>He writes concerning his journey from Lyons on the 21&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. 410. No. 2.</NOTE> and from
Antibes on the 26th of April.</P>
<P>He arrived at Rome the 3d of May; and in his letter from thence
on the 6th, he gives an account of his reception from cardinals, am|ba&s;&s;adors,
&amp;c. He had been introduced to the Pope.</P>
<P>&startq;I Was introduced, the &s;ame afternoon, to No. 400 [the Pope], to
whom, after all due and proper preambles, I &s;ignified the cau&s;e
of my coming; and humbly begging all &s;ecrecy, (which he promi&s;ed)
I gave him 300 [the King's] letter, written, as I &s;ignified, all with his
<PB N="417" REF="435">
own hand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> He immediately opened and read it; and could not but ex|pre&s;s
real &s;urprize and joy. The 530 [de&s;igns] I explained to him, as
well as I could, at large; &s;hewing how well all was prepared, and what
hopes of good &s;ucce&s;s; and added, that, &s;ince the 552 [glorious] 554
[enterprize] &s;eemed re&s;erved to make his time memorable, it could not
be doubted, but he would exert him&s;elf, &s;o as to have a con&s;iderable
&s;hare therein, and that proportionable to his own character, the cau&s;e,
and the merits and &s;ufferings of 300 [the King]; all which &s;poke &s;o loud
and clearly of them&s;elves, that there needed no words to expre&s;s them,
e&s;pecially to him, who was &s;o well acquainted and touched with what was
laid before him.</P>
<P>He really &s;hewed his good nature and inclinations, and a great regret,
that he was &s;o exhau&s;ted that he could not do what he would. How|ever,
the i&s;&s;ue of all was, that, before I &s;tirred, he promi&s;ed he would
forthwith 188 [&s;end] 46. 48. 18. 34. 46. 52. 46. 24. 36. 48. 44. 10.
34. 16. 350. [twenty thou&s;and crowns]. 138 [I], with all humility and
earne&s;tne&s;s, pre&s;t further, that all extraordinary means and efforts might
be made u&s;e of, for &s;o extraordinary a cau&s;e and end; nor do I think, I
omitted &s;o much as one argument in my in&s;tructions, be&s;ides what oc|curred
of my own. But di&s;ability was &s;till urged, with allegations, that
every body would be on his back; nay, even 38. 36. 30. 10. 34. 16.
[Poland,] which, without he would 528 [a&s;&s;i&s;t], &s;hould be forced to make
up with 502 [the Turk]. The truth is, I find, on the whole, he has
been &s;o teized and even threatened, by 514 [the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, &amp;c.]
that he is in a manner forced to trim, even <HI>contre coeur,</HI> nay &s;o far, that
even the 430 [money] mentioned is, he &s;aid, to pa&s;s as 432 [&s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence]
for the poor 456's [Catholicks and churchmen]. Further, he
has given a kind of promi&s;e, he will &s;till u&s;e all efforts, as &s;oon as the
news comes of the 444 [de&s;cent].</P>
<P>&startq;This morning, 416 [Howart] was with 400 [the Pope]; and did,
with a very good heart and his u&s;ual zeal, pre&s;s to the utmo&s;t, for &s;ome
addition for this pre&s;ent extraordinary exigence. But nothing, it &s;eems,
can yet be further done. 414 [Cardinal Forbin] is &s;candalized at the

&s;hall critically ob&s;erve, I only expect the news from 318 [England], and
the final operation it may make on 400 [the Pope]; who, left he might
prove too free, has been plied with a&s;tringents, e&s;pecially &s;ince his la&s;t
ble&s;&s;ing took air; yet cannot he retain the expre&s;&s;ing, at lea&s;t, his in|ward
affection; nay he has already directed &s;everal private devotions for
his incognito intention, though every body knows it as well as they do:
a cardinal with his curtains drawn, and SENZA FIOCCHE.&endq;</P>
<Q>June 10th, 1692.</Q>
<P>&startq;The contrary winds in your parts have al&s;o put a great many
to a &s;tand here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> and though at pre&s;ent, every one almo&s;t is in a running
dre&s;s, their &s;hirt and drawers, yet go they &s;till in their old <HI>piano</HI> pace. But
when I can get once more out of their enchanted circle, I hope to find
my legs again, and make all ha&s;te to your lord&s;hip; and that, as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible, after the longed-for news of your having pa&s;t the Rubicon; for
then there may be &s;ome other ground to go upon even here. In the
mean time, there are in this place, who &s;eem to fear, that whatever ble&s;|&s;ing
is perhaps &s;prinkled from hence, it may fall on the wrong &s;ide of
the channel.&endq;</P>
<P>June 17th, 1692. &startq;God knows where this may find your lord|&s;hip,
&s;ince there have been hopes &s;till above the&s;e five weeks here, of

&startq;However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> my lord, after I have done my part, I &s;hall ha&s;ten back

<P>&startq;No. 400 [the Pope] I am confident, will &s;till do what he can, tho'
with all his power, he cannot always do what he would; no not &s;o

<P>&startq;No. 356 [the declaration] was here ju&s;t fitted for the pre&s;s; but
No. 418 [M. Caprara], after the advances he him&s;elf made to get it
fini&s;hed, alledged, in fine, very unexpected difficulties, urged by tho&s;e
who were to pa&s;s it: &s;o that it is now laid a&s;ide. Many here pretend,
at lea&s;t, great inward zeal in their prayers for 300 [the King]. But, if
they do pray, they indeed do it &s;o as not to be &s;een of men, either in
their clo&s;ets, or, perhaps, the primitive grottoes and catacombs.&endq;</P>
<P>June 24th. &startq;I took occa&s;ion to &s;hew my&s;elf, la&s;t week, to 400 [the
Pope]; who, having been prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by 514 426 [hou&s;e of Au&s;tria],
in &s;ome points of news to 324's di&s;advantage, he a&s;ked what my let|ters
&s;aid; expre&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, &s;ome diffidence, as to 420 338

my lord, not had, I &s;ay, the lea&s;t word of any thing &s;ince I came
hither: nor indeed was it well to be expected, &s;ince your lord&s;hip, I
know, reckoned I had but a very few days to &s;tay.</P>
<P>&startq;La&s;t week, a petition for prayers in the 318 [Engli&s;h college] for
300 [the King] was granted for three days; yet would it not be allowed,
that 300 [the King] &s;hould be explicitly named in the Invito; but all
was expre&s;&s;ed in the u&s;ual general form; nor will I trouble your lord|&s;hip
now to tell how few of the grandees appeared on this occa&s;ion,
who&s;e pitiful politicks and pu&s;illanimity are incredible.&endq;</P>

pre&s;&s;ed the Pope to relieve James and his Catholick &s;ubjects. His Ho|line&s;s
&startq;reiterated his promi&s;es, that he would, <HI>In ogne Punto,</HI> do what|ever
he could. Quickly after, to prevent, perhaps, a further addre&s;s, he
<PB N="420" REF="438">
rang his bell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and called for a little plate, on which was a chaplet, two
gold and two &s;ilver medals of his own <HI>impre&s;a,</HI> which he was plea&s;ed to
give me out of his own hand, with 200 indulgences, and a gracious
kind of embrace, whil&s;t I did <HI>inginocbiarmi</HI> to receive his la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing;
after which, and returning humble thanks for all, and leaving him to his
own piety, I retired in form; and truly, whatever comes from him &s;eems
to proceed perfectly from the bottom of a mo&s;t &s;incere heart.&endq;</P>
<P>It is uncertain, whether William knew any thing concerning the trea|&s;onable
corre&s;pondence which was carried on, at this time, between &s;ome
on whom he had conferred employments, and the court of St. Germains.
But it is remarkable, that men who were con&s;cious to them&s;elves that they

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am glad to find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> by yours of the 9th, that myn of the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t
was come &s;afe to your hands. We are &s;till of the &s;ame mynd hear,
as to the purchas of the bayle No. 668 [admiral Edward Charey]; and,
therfore, we doubt not but, as &s;oon as it can be come at, you will let us
kno the terms we can hav it upon; and, becau&s;e it is &s;o tender ware,
you will take all imaginable care it be gently and carefully handled, that,
if after all it &s;hould not an&s;wer expectatione, you &s;hould not be to blame,
who are the factors. But we know, that you are u&s;ed to trade, and &s;o
confide on your &s;kill and dexterity.</P>
<P>As for the&s;e two bales you mention, No. 251 [lord Godolphin] and
No. 722 [lord Shrew&s;bery], for all I can yet learn, there is not much
more clearne&s;s here, than you hav ther; and, therfore, I can &s;ay nothing
of po&s;itiv concerning them as yet. I am glad you think we may do
<PB N="421" REF="439">
good with the goods No. 31 [Engli&s;h army in Ireland],<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> and I find the
Hamborou merchant [a member of the hou&s;e of commons] will get the
factory to deal in them as de&s;ired; and, if it be ready, I will inclo&s;e the te|nor
of it to you, by this po&s;t, tho' perhaps it cannot come this way. My
uncle is re&s;olved in that point. I am &s;ory that you &s;hould have &s;o &s;mal
hopes of the boxes No. 215 [the fleet], and No. 551 [the parliament of
England], at a time when they would yield us &s;o much profite. We mu&s;t
endeavour to make the be&s;t we can of them; and, tho' they be much
&s;poil'd. yet if great paynes and care be taken, and right ingredients be
applied, we hope they may yet turn to account; and, therefor, you mu&s;t
kno, from all the factory, what may be the be&s;t way to recover them,
and becau&s;e what can be&s;t do it, you kno, is the product of this place.
I &s;hall &s;end you a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;uch as we have, which, if rightly
applyed, may go a great way in the affair. The bale, No. 231 [David
Floyd], &s;hall &s;till be ready to mix with that No. 27 [Samuel Atkins],
when you and the partners &s;hall order it; and I find our partners here
much inclined to mix mor of our be&s;t goods on both &s;ides, if they
could be &s;ent without damage. For they think it will be impo&s;&s;ible to
adju&s;t the prices and the different &s;hares, without there be &s;ome mor
goods mixt, that the good and bad way go together. But the danger is,
by &s;eeking a better market, to lo&s;e all, and that we are loath to ventur.</P>
<P>The &s;ettlement you mentione was the re&s;ult of the good inclinations
of our debitor, who thought he could not oblige you mor than by leav|ing
it entirely to your own honour to draw a model; for this was no
more, it having never been delivered by him. He knew he would &s;ee
many of his creditors, before he had u&s;e for that &s;ettlement; and he was
re&s;olved
to take their advice in it; and, if it had not plea&s;ed them, he
would have changed it upon the place, having all things prepared for
that intent, as it appeared to you it was unwarrantable, and there is no|thing
he aims at more, than to plea&s;e, in all that is ju&s;t for him to in&s;ert,
and all the matters in di&s;pute are &s;uch as he thought he had granted
in the &s;ettlement: for &s;uch was his intentione. If they have not, it was
his lawyer's fault, not his; and, if you peru&s;e that letter to your part|ner
better, you may boldly a&s;&s;ure all the creditors, it is our debitor's true
&s;en&s;e, to which he will &s;tand, and which he will &s;till be ready to declare,
as often as he &s;hal be required to do it. As for the &s;ettlement, it fals
<PB N="422" REF="440">
of cour&s;e, never having been delivered: for you know delivering is as
nece&s;&s;ary as &s;igning and &s;ealing is, to make a valid &s;ecurity. All this
rightly u&s;ed may go far towards &s;ettling of mens minds, who aim at
nothing but having their ju&s;t debts paid; and I mu&s;t tell you, that,
having particularly informed my&s;elf from the book-keeper, he a&s;&s;ures
me, that this is our debitor's real intentions; and that he is mo&s;t a&s;|&s;ured,
that, if the mo&s;t rigide of his creditors knew the hone&s;ty of his
heart, and the truth of his intentions, as to the&s;e points, they would
&s;oon agree to let him come and po&s;&s;e&s;s his own e&s;tate, till he could bring
in his debts to pay them. There were a great many mi&s;takes, in relation
to particulars, which proceeded on letters from &s;ome idle partners there;
but, if any &s;uch &s;ettlement be again made, there will be no &s;uch over-&s;ight,
nor will there, I am confident, be any, or, at lea&s;t, few particulars,
&s;o much as named. But all will be left to the general meeting of the
creditors, both as to the nature of the payment to be made and debts to
be excepted, and I believe all the creditors will mor willingly &s;ubmit to
the whole meeting, than to any &s;eparate number. However, they mu&s;t
be con&s;ulted there, before it can be determined here, if the creditors
you know have &s;kill. Were they a&s;&s;ured of con&s;ent, it might engage
them to &s;hew their &s;kill on the boxes No. 215 [the fleet] and No. 551
[the parliament of England]; and, if they &s;hew all they can do, I que&s;|tion
not, they might be made marketable goods.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not think, that the bale No. 38 [lord Bath] is forgot or
under-rated. Our partner will try and give fairly for it, twice more than
the la&s;t merchant bought it at, and better payment, and the la&s;t half of
the bale No. 149 [lord Duras] into the bargain, or what he may choo&s;e
in lieu thereof of the &s;ame value; and, if this is not fair, judge you;
nay, if &s;ome more will do, it &s;hall be had one way or other. But this
is a matter &s;o delicate, that you mu&s;t handle it very prudently, lea&s;t it
wrong our credit, on the exchange, which is no hard matter, as things
&s;tand. I am affraid we hav not right under&s;tood the price demanded,
becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ted in goods and money, and, it may be, the inventory
of the goods was not right &s;et down: &s;o the be&s;t, in my opinion, will be
to give good words and continue the &s;ecurity, till you can &s;end over a
copy of the propo&s;ition, after you hav brought the price as low as ever
you can; that is, &s;till offering fair, as an hone&s;t man ought, the true
<PB N="423" REF="441">
value of the goods No. 573 [Plymouth]. This, you &s;ee, is not to ne|glect
the merchant; but, if you find it better to offer as above, it will
be entirely left to you, and the partners there.</P>
<P>As to what you de&s;ire to kno, from France, in relatione to the &s;ea, it
is impo&s;&s;ible for us, in this country, to penetrate, they keep their mat|ters
&s;o &s;ecret. But, if there be any appearance of what you hav u&s;e to
know, I &s;hall endeavour to giv you timely notice; only lay not out your
money, till I &s;end you word. I am &s;orry to hear the kingdom is in &s;o
bad a conditione; and I am of opinion, the failing of all our de&s;igns this
campaigne, when we have gained a &s;ea-&s;ight ea&s;ier than ever we can hope
to gain another, by which we were ma&s;ters of the &s;eas all the &s;ummer
long, will make the parliament think the conduct has not been good,
and con&s;equently their money not too well be&s;towed. Be&s;ides, this
bru&s;h in Flanders, where, without exaggeratione, we hav utterly lo&s;t
10,000 men, and of our be&s;t troops the mo&s;t, will not be an argument
to convince them we ought to tru&s;t any more to future promi&s;es; and
be&s;ides, our lo&s;&s;es by &s;ea, our harve&s;t &s;poil'd, our money tran&s;ported, our
plantations de&s;troyed by earthquakes and plague, may, I am affraid, put
it in the heads of thinking men, that God is not &s;atisfied with our con|duct
or cau&s;e. The&s;e begin to be the di&s;cour&s;es in this place; and that
&s;o much the rather, that the people begin here to be affraid for their
priviledges and libertys, &s;ince Torgoes, for &s;tanding to theirs, has been
blocked up, by the Stadtholder's orders, and forced, by military power,
to &s;ubmitt to his will; upon which a mo&s;t violent manife&s;to is come out,
publi&s;hed by the town; and we kno not yet, but it may breed ill
blood, which nothing but mere force re&s;trains, at this time. We wait
the event.</P>
<P>From France, where you know I have a good corre&s;pondent, which
neither of the Kings there could ever di&s;cover, I am informed, that the
affair of Dauphin&eacute;, &s;o much talked of, is a mere trifle; which, in the
main, does not &s;ignify any thing. Ambrun is in the middle of the
hills, and could not be relieved. It is of no &s;trength, and they are go|ing
to burn it again. There are great heats betwixt the D. of Savoy
and Caprara. The fir&s;t is for coming farther into France; and the
other, an old cunning &s;oldier, knows it impracticable. For, if he came
out among&s;t the hills, he would have the French hor&s;e before him and
<PB N="424" REF="442">
the foot behind him, and the pa&s;&s;ages &s;topped; &s;o that he will not con|&s;ent
to lo&s;e the army, for his R. H. hot headedne&s;s. His R. H. has
wrote hither to pre&s;s the de&s;cent and action in Flanders: for he &s;ees a
&s;torm gathering, troops marching again&s;t him from all quarters; and that
without there were a powerful diver&s;ione, he could do no good, nor &s;tay
any longer where he was. This we are not, I am affraid, in a condition
to perform; and that will, in all probability, make the end of the cam|paigne,
by the duke of Savoy's retreat, as &s;hamefull as the begining has
been on this &s;ide.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, before I end this long letter, that my unckle is per|fectly
well &s;atisfied with the true hone&s;ty of the father and &s;on you men|tione;
and, if ever he hav it in his power to do them any kindne&s;s,
you may a&s;&s;ure them of it from him: for it is his real intentions. As
likewi&s;e to Mr. G. [&s;uppo&s;ed to be lord Godolphin] you mention, of
who&s;e friend&s;hip to him he has many proofs, and will repay him his fa|vours,
to his own content. The box, No. 27 [Samuel Atkins], proves
&s;o good ware, that our partner is perfectly plea&s;ed with it, and will hav
mor of it, and keep it &s;till in his &s;hop. I entreat you to make the
right u&s;e of this, to &s;hew the owner of it, that he may expect ready pay|ment
of it for all he has of that commodity, to his &s;atisfactione, and that
he &s;hall have my uncle's, thanks over and abov the price. He has a real
e&s;teem and value for that commodity, as the be&s;t in its kind. I think
this is &s;ufficient trouble at once.</P>
<P>The goods, No. 699 [Sir Edward Seymour], have proved &s;tark naught,
for all we know here, and you may judge of them accordingly, if you
find not rea&s;ons there to the contrary, and we have but faint hopes of
the bale, No. 656 [lord Roche&s;ter]; yet, if you find them of u&s;e, you
may endeavour to purcha&s;e them, having dill the nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;pec|tione
in &s;o tickli&s;h a bargaine. You know, that I was always of the
opinion, that, &s;o long as you &s;tand at a di&s;tance among&s;t your&s;elves, you
will not be able to do any very con&s;iderable good; and, therefor, it is
the de&s;ire of others hear, that you &s;hould endeavour as clo&s;e an union
as can be, betwixt the creditors and debitors, that you may come to a
right under&s;tanding, and fall on methods of compounding the differences
&s;o hurtfull to us both; which, having proceeded from mi&s;takes and
fal&s;hoods, and having been pur&s;ued with malice, I doubt not, but the
<PB N="425" REF="443">
animo&s;ity, tho' high, will fall, &s;o &s;oon as you can come but to under|&s;tand
one another; which you never can do, &s;o long as you keep at a
di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Before the defeat of the French fleet at La Hogue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> King James had
excepted &s;everal per&s;ons in his offers of pardon; &s;ome indeed were ex|cepted
at their own de&s;ire; but he limited him&s;elf in his future conduct
by very general promi&s;es, and, of con&s;equence, gave little &s;atisfaction to
&s;uch as were not very &s;anguine for his re&s;toration. This and &s;everal
other rea&s;ons, which he him&s;elf communicated to Lewis XIV. in a me|morial,

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE royal care and paternal affection, I think my&s;elf bound to have
for my people, by that character which God Almighty has given
me, tran&s;mitted by the long &s;eries of their lawful monarchs, my royal
ance&s;tors, has ever made me watchful of all occa&s;ions of doing them
good, however ill I have been u&s;ed, by a con&s;iderable part of them;
which ill u&s;age was grievous to me, upon their account as well as my
own; &s;ince, from the fir&s;t moment of their defection, I fore&s;aw the cau&s;es
they would have to repent the change of my government, for an u&s;urpa|tion
which could not be maintained but with an infinite expence of blood
and trea&s;ure, be&s;ides the other judgments of Almighty God, they had
cau&s;e to fear, for the wrongs done to me, his vicegerent.</P>
<P>My circum&s;tances gave time to all my people to make reflections, on
the condition they had brought me and them&s;elves into, to find out the
fal&s;ene&s;s of the accu&s;ations again&s;t me, and to con&s;ider the hard&s;hips they
had drawn upon them&s;elves and their po&s;terity, which had &s;o good an
<PB N="426" REF="444">
effect, with many of all ranks and qualities among&s;t them, that, by their
mo&s;t earne&s;t prayers and repeated in&s;tances of the mi&s;ery they lay under,
they invited me to come to their relief, which made me lay hold on the
fir&s;t opportunity Almighty God put into my hands, to endeavour their
relief, with &s;uch force, as leaving no ground to fear a conque&s;t, might
yet protect my loyal &s;ubjects, and compel my enemies to hear that rea|&s;on
they had &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed by violence; intending, after the troubles at
home, and fears from abroad, were over, to have &s;ent away all &s;uch fo|reign
troops, as I was obliged to have brought with me, for my defence.
And, as I have always been ready to explain my gracious intentions to
my &s;ubjects of all qualities and per&s;ua&s;ions, I thought my&s;elf more par|ticularly
obliged to do it upon that important occa&s;ion; and, for that
purpo&s;e, had an e&s;croll of a declaration ready to con&s;ult with my friends,
at my arrival; and, by their con&s;ent and advice, and no otherwi&s;e, was
re&s;olved to publi&s;h that or any other form, more expre&s;&s;ive of my royal
and mo&s;t &s;incere intentions; for which end, I had a pre&s;s and all other
things nece&s;&s;ary brought along&s;t with me. For I was re&s;olved to &s;how
plainly my intentions, which, however they were di&s;gui&s;ed or ill expre&s;&s;ed,
in that form, were, and &s;till are,</P>
<P>That, immediately after my re&s;toration, I will call a free parliament,
in which my &s;ubjects &s;hall be repre&s;ented, by &s;uch as they &s;hall make
choice of, by their free election.</P>
<P>That, to the parliament &s;o called, I will leave the &s;ecurity of the
church of England e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, &s;o as that it may not be en|croached
upon, in its livings, dignities, &s;chools, univer&s;ities, or whatever
el&s;e it is now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of.</P>
<P>And that I will recommend to that parliament the ca&s;e of Diffenters,
and the &s;ettlement of liberty of con&s;cience, in &s;o good a way, that men
of all per&s;ua&s;ions may be reconciled to the government, and not look
upon it as their enemie, but may all of them think them&s;elves highly
concerned in its pre&s;ervation, upon the con&s;ideration of the good treat|ment
and protection they get from it, in the full enjoyment of their birth|rights.</P>
<P>To this parliament, I will recommend the care of the liberty and pro|perty
of the &s;ubject, as well as my own prerogative, which I &s;hall ever
u&s;e for the defence of that liberty and property; and it &s;hall not be my
<PB N="427" REF="445">
fault, if all things be not &s;o adju&s;ted there, as that I and my people may
have peace and plenty, a good under&s;tanding at home, and that &s;hare we
ought to have in the affairs of the world abroad.</P>
<P>All who have ever known me, have ob&s;erved my innate inclination to
mercy, and the plea&s;ure I take to forgive my enemies and all the inju|ries
done to me, of what&s;oever kind they are; &s;o that the many excep|tions
I &s;uffered to be made in that e&s;croll, were for terror, and to make
my mercy, in forgiving mo&s;t of the excepted, more con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>But now, to give the world and you a full proof of my natural incli|nation,
I declare, that I am ready to forgive all, who &s;hall not oppo&s;e
my re&s;toration, excepting &s;ome few of the mo&s;t obnoxious, whom I will
leave to my parliament to name, as my royal and deare&s;t brother did, in
the like ca&s;e; it being fit that &s;ome &s;hould fall, as a warning to po&s;te|rity
of the danger of &s;uch unwarrantable practices. After which, I will
give an act of grace and full indemnity to be pa&s;t in both hou&s;es of par|liament<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is, in lord Melfort's hand, a marginal note to a French tran&s;lation of this let|ter, in the&s;e words: &startq;This article is earne&s;tly de&s;ired by mo&s;t of the King's &s;ervants, but I am again&s;t any exception.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And, &s;ince reward is as nece&s;&s;ary to encourage the good, as puni&s;h|ment
is to fright the bad, I was, and am &s;till of the &s;ame mind, to be|&s;tow
my favours on &s;uch, as &s;hall be in&s;trumental, either &s;ecretly or
openly, in my re&s;toration; and that, according to the quality of the
&s;ervice they &s;hall render me, whether done by Engli&s;h or &s;trangers, by
&s;ea or by land.</P>
<P>And being re&s;tored, I do promi&s;e to govern according to law: to have
frequent and free parliaments: to regulate elections to parliament &s;o as
that it &s;hall be highly puni&s;hable to make fal&s;e or undue returns, either
for counties or corporations: that my mini&s;ters and coun&s;elors &s;hall be
&s;uch, as may be entirely tru&s;ted by my people; men of integrity and
reputation, capable of the employments I &s;hall give them.</P>
<P>And I &s;hall do all that lies in my power, to make my people happy,
under my ju&s;t and legal reign; which happine&s;s they cannot hope for, &s;o
long as this unju&s;t u&s;urpation continues, nor from any other form of
illegal government their hearts can imagine; which, if they endeavour
<PB N="428" REF="446">
to continue, I fore&s;ee, with grief, the &s;ad and di&s;mal con&s;equences their
unju&s;t actions will bring upon them&s;elves; whil&s;t, if they would open
their eyes, they cannot but &s;ee the many and great advantages mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
attend my re&s;toration.</P>
<P>The va&s;t expence of blood, trea&s;ure, and reputation, they have been
at, the&s;e four la&s;t years, is enough to give any rea&s;onable fort of men
warning of what is to come, and to convince them, that all the pro|mi&s;es
of future advantages are as vain as their cau&s;e is bad; which,
hitherto, has been &s;upported by fal&s;ehoods, as it was founded upon un|true
and malicious circum&s;tances, among which, none of the lea&s;t has
been, to a&s;per&s;e me with want of &s;incerity or good-will to my people.</P>
<P>To obviate which, I now think fit to declare, in the pre&s;ence of Al|mighty
God, the &s;earcher of hearts, that what I have here &s;et down is
my true meaning and de&s;ign, whenever it &s;hall plea&s;e God to re&s;tore me
to my own kingdoms; and that, if any thing be omitted or ob&s;cure, I
am ready to explain the &s;ame to any, having warrant from any con&s;ide|rable
party of my &s;ubjects to de&s;ire it. And, if, at pre&s;ent, I knew any
thing my &s;ubjects could ju&s;tly de&s;ire, for their further &s;atisfaction and
our joint intere&s;t, I would have in&s;erted it. But that being only po&s;|&s;ible,
when they are, by their repre&s;entatives, a&s;&s;embled in parliament,
I promi&s;e, that, in the fir&s;t I call, which &s;hall be as &s;oon as ever it &s;hall
be po&s;&s;ible for me, I &s;hall be ready to grant them whatever may tend to
our joint happine&s;s and tranquillity, and which may e&s;tabli&s;h a good
corre&s;pondence and legal pre&s;ervation of the rights of the crown and
the liberty and property of the &s;ubject. And I will do whatever may
tend to the advancement of trade and &s;etting up of manufactures, and
what may make the nation happy at home and re&s;pected abroad.</P>
<P>I need not tell you the inju&s;tice done me. There is not one of you,
how hardened &s;oever in the pro&s;ecution of his way, but is convinced of
the illegal and unwarrantable proceedings again&s;t me, as well as of the
fal&s;ene&s;s of the mo&s;t material grounds they proceeded upon: and though,
by their violence, I have been incapacitate from pro&s;ecuting my right
with that vigour and force I inclined, for the relief of my people;
yet Almighty God has, in his ju&s;tice, taken care to &s;how, by their &s;uffer|ings,
and particularly of &s;uch as had the greate&s;t hand in driving me out
of my dominions, how little he approves of your proceedings. Nor can
<PB N="429" REF="447">
the cleare&s;t &s;ighted among&s;t you make any rea&s;onable conjecture, where
the&s;e &s;ufferings will end, except you be &s;o wife as, in time, to lay hold
on the gracious offers I make you, and which you might have had, be|fore
my leaving England, when I was convinced, that I had been mi&s;led
by the evil coun&s;el of &s;ome now among&s;t you, to do &s;ome things as much
again&s;t my own intere&s;t, as they were di&s;plea&s;ing to my people, had not
the exorbitant ambition of the prince of Orange hindered all the effects
of my royal and gracious intentions, at that time, as is known to many
of you, who well &s;aw, that it was my crown, and not the reformation of
bad coun&s;el that he came for; which is evident by this, as well as many
other demon&s;trations, that he care&s;&s;es the authors of the&s;e coun&s;els, he &s;o
much cried out again&s;t. But he knows, and they have &s;ince confe&s;&s;ed,
that they were given me for his &s;ervice and my undoing.</P>
<P>The not embracing the offers I made, before my being driven out of
England, when the prince of Orange refu&s;ed all treaty, has co&s;t you
dear; and, therefore, I hope you will be better advi&s;ed, than to neglect
this opportunity, when I offer you &s;ecurity for all your rights, religious
and civil, and to re&s;tore you peace, plenty, and pro&s;perity, under the
ancient, legal, and hereditary monarchy, your predece&s;&s;ors and your&s;elves
lived happily under. I am confident all your fellow-&s;ubjects, in the
army and navy, will concur with you, in &s;o good a de&s;ign; and I &s;hall
always be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, to drive out &s;trangers from among you, and
to recover your ju&s;t legal rights, as well as my own, with a force which
may protect and not fright you; any thing tending towards a conque&s;t
or diminution of the ju&s;t rights, liberty, and property of the people of
England, being what never entered into my thoughts.</P>
<P>If there be any thing further you would be &s;atisfied in, upon &s;ending
&s;uch of your number to me, as you can be&s;t tru&s;t, I doubt not but I will
give them full &s;atisfaction; and I promi&s;e, that they &s;hall come and re|turn
with all &s;afety.</P>
<P>If you embrace the&s;e offers I make to you, and, by you, to all my
people, you &s;ee it will depend upon your&s;elves to be as happy as you
can wi&s;h for. But, if you reject what I have &s;o propo&s;ed, I do not
doubt but that Almighty God, the avenger of injured princes, will do
ju&s;tice to me and to my deare&s;t &s;on, the prince of Wales, and it may
<PB N="430" REF="448">
be with circum&s;tances of more &s;everity to the ob&s;tinate among&s;t you, by
making the nation in general, and you in particular, account for the in|nocent
blood of my faithful &s;ubjects, lo&s;t in the defence of my un|doubted
rights, and thou&s;ands of my &s;ubjects &s;lain, in the defence of
rebellion and trea&s;on; which blood mu&s;t needs be heavy on the land,
and on you, till, by a &s;incere repentance and full re&s;titution of what you
have violently and unju&s;tly taken from me, you appea&s;e the Divine Ju&s;|tice,

<P>&startq;WHEN we reflect upon our own age, and the condition of our
po&s;terity and kingdoms, we cannot be without earne&s;t de&s;ire of
bringing things to the &s;peedie&s;t i&s;&s;ue. But what we ought to do, in or|der
to it, has been hitherto very difficult to us to find out. It has been
our misfortune to be mi&s;taken, in our applications to our people, tho'
we can appeal to God for our own &s;incerity. But, however, we will not
be wanting in tho&s;e methods we think mo&s;t likely; and, therefore, we
&s;end this to you, wherein, according to the mo&s;t natural &s;ignification of
the words, we a&s;&s;ure you, that we are ready to agree to any laws, that
&s;hall be de&s;ired at our hands to &s;ecure the prote&s;tant religion, as now
e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in the church of England; and to &s;ettle, with the
concurrence of our parliament, a liberty of con&s;cience. And we are
al&s;o willing and fully re&s;olved to &s;ecure liberty and property, not only
from any male admini&s;trations, that may fall in during our reign, but like|wi&s;e
again&s;t any inva&s;ion may be de&s;igned by our po&s;terity; and we &s;hall
take effectual mea&s;ures for doing of it, in the very fir&s;t parliament which
can be got together; and we &s;hall, during our reign, delight to meet
<PB N="431" REF="449">
our people frequently in parliament, as the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t expedient to
beget that mutual confidence, which renders the King truly great and the
&s;ubject perfectly happy: &s;o far we are from de&s;igning or attempting to
introduce an arbitrary power in the crown. We hope we have expre&s;&s;ed
our&s;elves plainly and we mean hone&s;tly; and we are &s;en&s;ible the nation
(be&s;ides the violence they have done to their own con&s;ciences) have not
found their account in the injury they have done us. We know there
are &s;ome, who are rather looking after other projects for redre&s;s, than
wi&s;hing our re&s;toration. But we al&s;o know, that they cannot &s;tart any,
that &s;hall be either a better e&s;tabli&s;hment for the future, or can relieve
them in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, than calling us home. And, if you
will depute any to come to di&s;cour&s;e us more at large, we do not doubt
to give an entire &s;atisfaction to any you commi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e; and
let nothing, that is pa&s;t, continue any mi&s;under&s;tanding betwixt us, &s;ince
we are de&s;irous and ready, on our part, to forget and pardon all the mi&s;|carriages
of all our &s;ubjects, without any exception, and to enter into any
new mea&s;ures, &s;uch as may, according to the be&s;t judgment we can
make, clo&s;e with the united intere&s;t of our people; and we wi&s;h more of
them would let us know their minds, without the lea&s;t degree of flattery,

therefore, have nothing to reproach our&s;elf with, we &s;end this to a&s;&s;ure
<PB N="432" REF="450">
you, that, as &s;oon as we are re&s;tored, we will call a free parliament, to
which we will leave the &s;ettlement of the prote&s;tant religion, as it is at
pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, in the church of England. That we &s;hall
endeavour in parliament an impartial liberty of con&s;cience; and we are
willing and fully re&s;olved, in our parliament above mentioned, to &s;e|cure
the liberty and property of our &s;ubjects, not only from any pre&s;ent,
but likewi&s;e future, encroachments. And we &s;hall, during our reign,
delight to meet our people frequently in parliament, as the be&s;t and
&s;ure&s;t way to beget that mutual confidence and corre&s;pondence, which
renders the King truly great and the &s;ubjects perfectly happy; &s;o far
we are from de&s;igning or attempting to introduce an arbitrary power in
the crown. We know, that the nation, be&s;ides the violence they have
done to their own con&s;ciences, have not found their account in the inju|rys
they have done us; and yet, &s;ome of them, rather look after other
more uncertain projects for redre&s;s, than wi&s;h our re&s;toration. But
we know likewi&s;e, that they can never find any that can either be a
better e&s;tabli&s;hment for the future, or a &s;peedier relief from their pre&s;ent
hard circum&s;tances, than the calling us home; and, that no man may be
hindered from &s;o good a work, by the fear of our re&s;enting the wrongs
done us, we further a&s;&s;ure you, that we will pardon all our &s;ubjects,
without exception, who &s;hall not oppo&s;e our re&s;toration. Having thus
&s;hewn our intentions to you, as far as it is po&s;&s;ible for us, with the
information we yet have of our people's de&s;ires, we &s;hall &s;till be ready
further to explain them to &s;uch as you &s;hall &s;end to us for that effect; by
whom we &s;hall be glad to be informed of our people's de&s;ires, wi&s;hing no|thing

<HEAD TYPE="sub">There are two parties among the Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 102.</NOTE> the church of England

mentions the Earl of Middleton, Major Sackfield, and the Earl of Shrew&s;bury.
&mdash;The la&s;t lays down his office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, at the de&s;ire of James.
&mdash;A third party demand a declaration, addre&s;&s;ed to both hou&s;es of par|liament.
&mdash;The advantage and di&s;advantage of &s;ending one, con&s;idered&mdash;
The di&s;advantage is greater.&mdash;It was as a previous &s;tep for recalling
James, that the Earl of Marlborough moved in parliament, to di&s;mi&s;s all
foreigners from their employments. Some of the party who were igno|rant
of his intentions, &s;u&s;pected it was to &s;erve the prince&s;s of Den|mark;
and made a di&s;covery to the Earl of Portland.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tran&s;lation.</HEAD>
<P>I Always imagined, that a more ample explanation of my intentions,
than was contained in the la&s;t project of a declaration, was nece&s;&s;ary;
but that I mu&s;t wait for a proper time of &s;ending it.</P>
<P>The two o&s;ten&s;ible parties of prote&s;tants, who are for me in England,
are the epi&s;copals and the republicans, who are &s;o named, although many
among them are not for a republic. The fir&s;t have good intentions, but
little power, in the pre&s;ent conjuncture; although, if there was an
opportunity of their taking arms, my enemies would find them formid|able.
The &s;econd are more powerful, having all the employments and
authority of the prince of Orange in their hands. But they are more to
be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ab&s;olutely think, that I &s;hould not &s;end a declaration, till I
am ready to go over to England; and their opinion is, that I ought not
to make any conce&s;&s;ion, which may be of any prejudice to the crown.</P>
<P>The &s;econd are for conce&s;&s;ions. But they oppo&s;e, as much as the
fir&s;t, my &s;ending any explanation or any other paper, until they give me
<PB N="434" REF="452">
notice, and have had time to prepare the people to receive it. I have,
accordingly, followed a middle cour&s;e till now, and &s;ent nothing written
in my own hand. But I have made the earl of Melfort write to both
parties, in terms, which have given a general &s;atisfaction, as appears by
the letters which have been written to him on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons, which the republican-party have always alledged again&s;t
my &s;ending any thing in writing at this time, are, that a great part of the
people being prejudiced by the artifices of the prince of Orange again&s;t
whatever I may write, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary to wait, until the&s;e pre|judices
are removed by degrees, but that it is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary they
&s;hould be removed, by the means of tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who guide the
opinions of the people. That endeavours were u&s;ed to accompli&s;h this;
and that notice would be &s;ent to me in proper time. It is very certain,
that this party, being e&s;teemed by my enemies as their deliverers, will
have more credit with them than any other.</P>
<P>Secondly, they &s;ay, that if I &s;ent any kind of explanation of my inten|tions,
before they had time to prepare the people to receive it, it would
induce my enemies to write again&s;t it, and to put fal&s;e con&s;tructions on it,
and the generality would believe them rather than me and, therefore,
&s;uch a writing would not only have no good effect, but, on the contrary,
would have a very bad one, while I was not in a condition to &s;upport it
with a good army, which, undoubtedly, would make it produce a due
effect. That, to di&s;po&s;e the people in my favour, tho&s;e rich noblemen
and gentlemen, who live at their ea&s;e, and are not willing to ri&s;que much,
mu&s;t exert them&s;elves, and contrive, in an indirect manner, the means of
exciting the people, to chace away the prince of Orange, when they &s;how
that they have nothing but the public good in view; and, under that pretext,
they will be followed by the people, and may thereby promote my de&s;igns,
with &s;ecurity, and without ri&s;quing any thing. Whereas, if the prince of
Orange and his creatures were once alarmed, by a declaration which would
render them vigilant, in di&s;covering my friends, and oppo&s;ing their de&s;igns;
the&s;e great men would not choo&s;e to ri&s;que any thing, for fear of being &s;u&s;|pected
by the people as well as by the prince of Orange; and, perhaps,
they would be obliged to favour his de&s;igns, in order to conceal their real
<PB N="435" REF="453">
inclinations, which would enable the prince of Orange to obtain from the
parliament, whatever he would demand at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>A third rea&s;on they alledge is, that whatever I could &s;ay is already
well known to them; that is to &s;ay, to the mo&s;t powerful men among
them. For, as they did not choo&s;e to corre&s;pond with me, until I had
informed them of my intentions; I have done &s;o, and they have been
perfectly &s;atisfied with them: and, as they are men of quality and mem|bers
of parliament, who have a great deal of influence, there is no doubt
but they have made them known to others, and that my &s;entiments at
this time, are &s;ufficiently known to this pretended parliament.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the rea&s;ons which this republican party have laid before
me, and, for which, they have intreated me not to &s;end any thing in writ|ing
at this time; and four days ago, the earl of Middleton has urged
the &s;ame thing, by a courier, which my friends in England &s;ent on pur|po&s;e
to me, a&s;&s;uring me at the &s;ame time, that great pains were taken with
the parliament, with the fleet, and with the army, and that I &s;hould have
news of this very &s;oon.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be remarked, that all tho&s;e who are of this party, have not
been traitors. For the earl of Middleton, who was my &s;ecretary of &s;tate,
when I came away, never did a fal&s;e &s;tep: major general Sackville never
failed in his duty; and the earl of Shrew&s;bury, who was &s;ecretary of &s;tate
to the prince of Orange, laid down his employment, by my orders.
The&s;e men are too clear fighted to allow them&s;elves to be duped, and
they have too much intere&s;t in my re&s;toration, to allow them&s;elves to be
corrupted.</P>
<P>It was from a regard to this party, and from the weight of their argu|ments,
that I have been induced to delay to &s;end any paper, until I
&s;hould be advi&s;ed by them, or until I &s;hould &s;ee, at lea&s;t, their conduct
in this pretended parliament, from which I might judge of their
&s;incerity.</P>
<P>Although I mention only the prote&s;tants here, the catholicks are
unanimou&s;ly of the &s;ame way of thinking. But as they are le&s;s em|ployed,
their advice has the le&s;s weight. But there are, at this time, &s;ome
private per&s;ons who, I have all the rea&s;on in the world to believe, are of &s;o
<PB N="436" REF="454">
little con&s;equence, that they dare not declare them&s;elves, for fear their
characters &s;hould in&s;tantly de&s;troy all their influence. The&s;e have pro|po&s;ed
to &s;end &s;uch a paper, as the others, who are of the fir&s;t quality,
have &s;o &s;trongly di&s;approved of at this conjuncture.</P>
<P>Upon which, the fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered is, why the&s;e unknown
per&s;ons have not made their propo&s;al directly to my&s;elf, and whether it is
not for fear I &s;hould know them for &s;uch as they are. Whereas, they
pa&s;s them&s;elves for very different per&s;ons from what they really are, upon
tho&s;e who cannot know them &s;o ea&s;ily as I do.</P>
<P>It is to be con&s;idered likewi&s;e, whether the opinion of the&s;e unknown
per&s;ons is to be preferred to the opinions of tho&s;e other men of quality,
intere&s;t, and weight in the kingdom, who have it in their power to act
them&s;elves and to employ others. Whereas, on the contrary, the&s;e un|known
per&s;ons, who, for any thing I know, are as much traitors as others
have been, do not pretend to any other power or credit, but that of
pre&s;enting the paper, nor to any other merit, but what that de&s;ign will
procure them. But, &s;etting all this a&s;ide, let us con&s;ider the good and
the harm which this writing will produce. Fir&s;t, though I &s;hould write
it, and place it in the hands of the&s;e unknown per&s;ons, addre&s;&s;ed to the
lords and commons a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, it is certain they would
not receive it. For they would not dare to receive it, when it comes
from me, without the con&s;ent of the prince of Orange, which he certainly
will never give, unle&s;s he &s;ees that he may derive &s;ome notable advantage
from it. So that all I would gain thereby, would be a fre&s;h affront,
which would dimini&s;h my reputation among the people, and be a reproach
to my conduct, for having tried an expedient, which I might naturally
imagine to be u&s;ele&s;s, not to &s;ay entirely contrary to my intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>But, &s;econdly, making the &s;uppo&s;ition, that what I write would be re|ceived
and read, all the good I could expect from it is, that, as what it
contains is &s;ufficiently conformed to the de&s;ires of a con&s;iderable part of
the people, it might in time, and in proportion as the mi&s;ery of the people
induces them to make reflections, &s;often their minds, and incline them to
con&s;ider, how little they gain by the continuance of the war, and what
advantages they might expect from me. What I write, thus &s;oftening
<PB N="437" REF="455">
the rough humours of the people, might, by degrees, dimini&s;h their
malice again&s;t me; and, when they would find a favourable conjuncture,
for taking a &s;ide, it might encourage them to choo&s;e mine preferably to
that of the prince of Orange, when they would find an equal probability
of &s;afety on my &s;ide, as on the &s;ide of the prince; that is to &s;ay, when
they would &s;ee me at the head of an army as &s;trong as his, and not
&s;ooner.</P>
<P>This, I think, is all the good, which what I could write would produce,
even were the conjuncture favourable for &s;ending it, and did all my
friends con&s;ent to it, which, after all, is but a &s;low remedy, when it is
not &s;upported by a force &s;ufficient to induce the people to take a &s;ide. I
call it a &s;low remedy, becau&s;e it is not to be believed, that the people of
England, hardened as they are, will be influenced miraculou&s;ly at the
&s;ight of a paper, of which they have already had the &s;ub&s;tance in &s;o many
others; and that they will change all at once from black to white, be|fore
they have the fleet or army in their power, or are anywi&s;e prepared
for it. The laws which they them&s;elves have made in favour of the
prince of Orange, hinder them from declaring again&s;t him, even in par|liament.
Therefore along with &s;uch a paper, a negociation and intrigues
would be nece&s;&s;ary; and this is what I call a &s;low remedy, and what
would be of no avail, in hindering whatever the prince of Orange &s;hould
demand from the parliament; on the contrary, it might contribute to
advance his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The di&s;advantages which &s;uch a paper might produce, appear to me to
be of another nature. For they would be great and immediate. Fir&s;t,
it would excite an infinite number of people to write again&s;t me, who
would not fail to blacken me, and who would not mi&s;s to be believed
now as formerly.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is to be con&s;idered, that the humours of the people are
vi&s;ibly changed: that many among them, tired of the war, and of the
heavy taxes which they are obliged to pay, begin to return to my in|tere&s;ts,
and to look out for a remedy to their misfortunes; and, though
I am not, perhaps, more beloved than I was, yet it is certain, that the
prince of Orange becomes daily much more odious, and that a great part
of my &s;ubjects begin to be very wearied of him. They, in fact, de&s;ign
<PB N="438" REF="456">
to oppo&s;e him &s;trongly in parliament. Some in order to break the
alliance with the confederates, as a thing u&s;ele&s;s to England, which ex|hau&s;ts
it&s;elf for them without pretending to draw any advantage from it.
Others in order to quarrel with the Dutch, being unwilling to have any
thing further to do with them; and all, in general, exclaim again&s;t an
army in Flanders, &s;aying, that it exhau&s;ts the kingdom, and that a fleet
would be &s;ufficient for their defence; that the money which that army
co&s;ts would be &s;pent in the country, and that an infinite number of men
would be &s;aved, of which England &s;tands much in need, being greatly
depopulated by the number of inhabitants who go to the colonies. Thus
my party, covering them&s;elves with the ma&s;k of patrioti&s;m, will join with
the di&s;contented to dimini&s;h the credit of the prince of Orange; and,
if they allow it to go on, will do every thing they can again&s;t him. But
if, in the mid&s;t of their conte&s;tations, a writing under my name is pro|duced
which di&s;covers the manoeuvres of a third party, immediately all
tho&s;e who are again&s;t me, and again&s;t the prince of Orange, would unite
them&s;elves rather to him than to me for the pre&s;ent: his friends would
redouble their zeal: the populace, who are for him, would likewi&s;e in|terfere;
and even my friends would be obliged to appear the mo&s;t
zealous for him, in order to conceal their real &s;entiments, and to &s;ave
them&s;elves from his vengeance. So that it appears from this con&s;ider|ation,
that &s;uch a writing would tend rather to make the parliament
concur with the prince of Orange, than to embroil them together.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be con&s;idered likewi&s;e, that the prince of Orange &s;ees clearly
the de&s;igns which will be carried on again&s;t him, if the parliament con|tinues
long. He therefore u&s;es every endeavour to di&s;patch bu&s;ine&s;s
as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and to hinder them from &s;peaking of any thing but
the &s;upplies which he a&s;ks, until he has &s;ecured them; and it is for this
rea&s;on, he has, at this time, changed his language. For, in&s;tead of con|tinuing
to &s;ay, that France is exhau&s;ted, he &s;ays now, that his mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty is in a condition to carry every thing before him; and
that the war is at their gates, unle&s;s they grant immediate and ample &s;up|lies,
for maintaining both the fleet and army. The Dutch gazettes and
the news from England are full of this. For they write, that he &s;tations
his troops along the coa&s;ts. That he &s;till &s;ends &s;hips to &s;ea, and circulates
<PB N="439" REF="457">
reports in London, that I am ready to go over to England, and all this,
in order to intimidate the people, and to engage them to grant him what
he a&s;ks. So that if, in the mid&s;t of all this, they &s;aw any thing appear
at this time in my name, which might be interpreted to be a declaration,
it would &s;erve only to be a farther confirmation of the prince of Orange's
argument, and to induce the parliament to grant him money in&s;tantly.
For his party in parliament would cry aloud, for the good of the king|dom,
and the &s;afety of the prince and prince&s;s of Orange; and, in that
general ardour for the good of the country, whoever would &s;how the
lea&s;t coolne&s;s, would run a ri&s;que of being torn to pieces by the populace;
and in that way the prince of Orange would obtain &s;peedily and plenti|fully,
what there is great rea&s;on to think he will not obtain &s;o &s;oon,
nor &s;o proportionate to his wants, if the maleconents and my friends in
parliament are allowed to do what I expect from them.</P>
<P>Further, the prince of Orange would &s;oon di&s;cover, that the alarm given
by that writing was groundle&s;s, and he would con&s;ider it as an advice
given by France, which he would &s;uppo&s;e to be reduced to extremities,
and obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;uch an expedient. That would elate
him and the con&s;ederates with pride, and make them look upon the mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian King, my deare&s;t brother, as if he was not any more in a con|dition
to &s;upport the war, which might produce very di&s;agreeable con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be la&s;tly con&s;idered, that, when a parliament in England votes
to rai&s;e a &s;um of money, it is properly but a compliment, until the &s;um
is a&s;&s;igned upon certain funds capable of paying it, in&s;omuch that
&s;carcely any one oppo&s;es this fir&s;t vote, unle&s;s they want to quarrel
openly with the government. But the manner of oppo&s;ing it and of
&s;ecuring them&s;elves, when they do &s;o, is by hindering the funds from
being named, or by introducing preferably &s;ome other bu&s;ine&s;s, which may
embroil the prince and the parliament, as happened la&s;t year, when they
con&s;ented, by a general vote, to give five millions and a half for continu|ing
a vigorous war again&s;t France. But when they came to name the
funds, they protracted the affair to &s;uch length, that the prince of Orange
was not able to make the preparations he intended; and, in&s;tead of five
millions and a half, they gave him in reality but three millions, in&s;omuch,

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="439" REF="459">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="440" REF="460">
that his debts now amount to nine millions, which appears &s;ufficient
from the promi&s;e he makes to the &s;ailors, who will &s;erve this winter on
halt pay, of paying them in the beginning of next &s;ummer their arrears
to the month of September la&s;t, as a particular favour. This &s;hows, that
the proper time for acting again&s;t the prince of Orange in parliament, is
after the fir&s;t vote is pa&s;&s;ed. For it is not to be imagined, that I have
yet friends enough to act openly in oppo&s;ing this fir&s;t vote, which is al|ways
pa&s;&s;ed with eclat, in order to intimidate their enemies who do not
know the con&s;equence, and who believe that the payment of the money
depends upon it, which is far from being the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>My friends de&s;igned la&s;t year to recal me by the parliament. The
plan was concerted, and lord Churchill was to propo&s;e in parliament, to
drive all &s;trangers out of the council and army, and even out of the king|dom.
If the prince of Orange had con&s;ented to that propo&s;al, they
would have had him in their power. If he had rejected it, he would have
made the parliament declare again&s;t him: and, at the &s;ame time,
lord Churchill, with the army, was to declare for the parliament; the
fleet was to do the &s;ame, and I was to be recalled. They had already
begun to execute this project, and had gained a con&s;iderable party, when
&s;ome loyal &s;ubjects, who were indi&s;creet, believing that they &s;erved me,
and imagining that what my lord Churchill did was not on my account,
but on account of the prince&s;s of Denmark, had the imprudence to di&s;|cover
the whole to Bentinck, and thereby diverted the blow.</P>
<P>This de&s;ign is &s;till in agitation, and managed by tho&s;e who are again&s;t
the &s;ending the writing in que&s;tion. It is therefore to be con&s;idered, if
it is proper to interrupt the de&s;igns of men of that con&s;equence, who are
capable of doing &s;uch great things, and that for a project of unknown
per&s;ons, who propo&s;e an expedient as dangerous as it is uncertain, and
who promi&s;e nothing but to deliver the writing.</P>
<P>Therefore, all things duly con&s;idered, I cannot hinder my&s;elf from
thinking, that &s;uch a writing, &s;ent without the con&s;ent of my friends,
might produce very great and immediate di&s;advantages; and that, even
though it &s;hould be &s;ent in the be&s;t manner and at a proper conjuncture,
it could not produce, at mo&s;t, but advantages which are &s;low and un|certain.</P>

any thing, which would expo&s;e him to hazard or expence. But that the
fear of an inva&s;ion would always embarra&s;s the prince of Orange. In
&s;uch circum&s;tances, he would find it difficult to rai&s;e money; and though
after the late alarm he had &s;eized &s;everal per&s;ons who were di&s;affected to
him, and &startq;a great many men of quality, he did not pre&s;ume to inflict the
lea&s;t puni&s;hment upon any of them. Such affection had the people for
them, that they would not be evidences again&s;t them, although it is cer|tain,
that more than twenty thou&s;and men had been enli&s;ted by them,
which rendered them highly criminal towards him; and there is rea&s;on
to believe, that if the fleet had not fought, while affairs were &s;o cir|cum&s;tanced,
the prince of Orange, in a little time, would have been
reduced to the la&s;t extremity, for want of money; and his government
<PB N="442" REF="462">
&s;haken in England: &s;o little did his friends think them&s;elves in &s;afety,
and &s;o much did the King's intere&s;t gain over the minds of the people,
though more from intere&s;t than from &s;entiments of con&s;cience or of duty.&endq;</P>
<P>The remaining part of the memorial was intended to &s;how, that it
was the intere&s;t of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty to begin again the &s;ame
game, in appearance, by &s;ending a &s;ufficient number of troops, parti|cularly
Iri&s;h, into winter-quarters on the coa&s;t of Normandy: that this
would alarm the people of England, prevent the parliament from grant|ing
money to the prince of Orange, induce his creditors to urge the
payment of their debts, and oblige him to recal his army from Flanders.</P>
<P>&startq;If the men of rank,&endq; continues the memorial, &startq;who are in the
prince of Orange's intere&s;t, and, at the &s;ame time, corre&s;pond with the
King of England, are &s;incere in their profe&s;&s;ions, which, though difficult
to be believed, is, however, very po&s;&s;ible, this will give them an op|portunity
of making their propo&s;als more boldly in parliament, in ca&s;e
they find they are as much ma&s;ters of the army and of the fleet as they
expect to be. At any rate, great advantages may be derived from it;
and the &s;ecret being well kept, nothing can be lo&s;t by it; more e&s;pecially
as his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, if he does not &s;end a fleet to &s;ea in the
winter, will have the appearance of troops upon the coa&s;t, to repel the
in&s;olence of the Engli&s;h and of the Dutch, who otherwi&s;e may have it
in their power to in&s;ult and to alarm.&endq;</P>
<P>The late King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 107.</NOTE> in a declaration which he intended to &s;end to the fleet,
in the month of February this year, a&s;&s;ured them, that if any captain
of a &s;hip, commander, or officer of the fleet, brought over any &s;hip
of war to his &s;ervice, by repairing with it to any port in France, or by
joining the French fleet, they would have a full pardon for all they did
again&s;t his authority, until the day of their return to their duty; and
that, from the moment they arrived, he would give them the &s;ame
commi&s;&s;ions in his &s;ervice, which they had in the &s;ervice of the prince
of Orange, and the &s;ame pay from the date of their arrival, or the pay
of the officers, &s;ailors, or &s;oldiers of the French fleet, who had the &s;ame
rank, according to their own choice.</P>
<P>&startq;We declare likewi&s;e,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;that, when we &s;hall return to Eng|land,
all the &s;aid officers, &s;oldiers, and &s;ailors will return with us, without

any hinderance; and, in order that all our faithful &s;ubjects may know,
that we have it in our power to perform what we promi&s;e here, we
declare, that all that is promi&s;ed by us, is with the con&s;ent and appro|bation
of our very dear brother, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King.&endq;</P>
<P>He concludes, with promi&s;ing, when he &s;hall be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, be|&s;ides
recompen&s;ing them for their &s;ervices, to pay them their arrears from
the beginning of the war.</P>

The letter to which lord Middleton refers his corre&s;pondent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1693. April.</NOTE> in the
preceding, is as follows:</P>
<Q>Rotterdam [St. Germains], April 19th, 1693.</Q>
<P>THIS being the fir&s;t opportunity I have had of giving you an ac|count
of your affairs, I mu&s;t tell you, in the fir&s;t place, that the
only di&s;appointment I have met with is, that Mr. Milles [lord Melfort]
had nothing from you, that could &s;ufficiently enable me to do it as I
would and ought. But I hope the bundle, that is &s;ent by the tru&s;ty
carrier you know, will explain the main matter to your &s;atisfaction. It
was nece&s;&s;ary to cut out the fir&s;t part of it here, to &s;how them for what
purpo&s;e it was de&s;igned. But, if it does not fit exactly, I am fully im|powered
to tell you, that it may be mended by the trade&s;men upon the
place, provided nothing be done to pinch them within or without, which
cannot rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed. The alteration mu&s;t &s;tand as it does,
le&s;t the workmen who are to be employed, &s;hould de&s;pair of their
wages. As to what concerns Wil&s;on [Middleton], he has rea&s;on to be
&s;atisfied, being entertained by the good farmer [King] and his wife [the
Queen], better than he could expect; nor can I omit telling you, that
the bold Briton<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The prince of Wales.</NOTE> &s;urpri&s;ed me with joy, being infinitely above what has
been reported of him.</P>
<P>But what &s;urpri&s;ed Wil&s;on [Middleton] mo&s;t, was the lord of the manor
[French King]. He le&s;s admires his fortunes, &s;ince he was acquainted with
him, and recived civilities from him, which he cannot mode&s;tly repeat.
Both he and his tru&s;tees [mini&s;ters] &s;eemed &s;atisfied with the particulars of
the e&s;tate; and are re&s;olved to go on with the purcha&s;e, co&s;t what it will;
but cannot determine the time, till it appears whether this &s;ea&s;on proves
more favourable than the la&s;t. The greate&s;t rubin this matter is, the high
value they have for him [King William], who keeps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and, by
the gla&s;&s;es they have u&s;ed, the leech appears to be a leviathan. But
nothing has been omitted to undeceive them. It is not to be doubted,
but the propere&s;t means will be u&s;ed to per&s;uade the tenants of their
intere&s;t to induce them thereby to turn to us. It will be nece&s;&s;ary,
therefore, that they &s;hould be informed of what is de&s;igned. But the
preci&s;e time is left to the lawyers who are to manage the &s;uit, who&s;e
merits I have repre&s;ented as I ought; and there are no acknowledgments
<PB N="445" REF="465">
they may not expect in particular and punctual performance. In the
main, Mr. Milles [lord Melfort] and Wil&s;on [Middleton] are in perfect
friend&s;hip; and, indeed, the fir&s;t is entirely di&s;po&s;ed as you could wi&s;h;
and I doubt not but you will do him ju&s;tice, both here and there. The
only thing that lies heavy upon me, is my concern for the &s;plenetic
widow and poor orphans, whom I am confident you'll cheri&s;h, as much

<P>The late King con&s;ented to eight propo&s;itions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June.</NOTE> which his friends in
Britain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol.</NOTE> who wanted to re&s;tore him on conditions, and were known by
the name of compounders, &s;ent over to him by the earl of Middleton,
who went to France in the beginning of this year. On the 17th of
April, N. S. James publi&s;hed a declaration, which was &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed
over all England; where &s;ome of his adherents were &s;eized for making
it public.<NOTE PLACE="marg">No 100. and D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 17.</NOTE> It was couched in terms which his friends imagined would
have given general &s;atisfaction; but it &s;eems it gave great offence to the
Iri&s;h faction, who were exorbitant in their expectations, and rated
their &s;ervices too high. King James declared his intention of calling to|gether
the repre&s;entatives of the kingdom, and of con&s;enting to the &s;e|veral
regulations and &s;ecurities he mentions. &startq;And in that parliament,&endq;
&s;ays he, &startq;we will al&s;o con&s;ent to every thing they &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary
to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the late act of &s;ettlement of Ireland, made in the reign of

St. Germains, <DATE>15th June, 1693.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I Should have thanked your lord&s;hip &s;ooner, for the honour you did
me, if I had not waited till I could return you &s;ome good news for
yours. The King was plea&s;ed to declare, ye&s;terday, that his declaration
had been di&s;per&s;ed, by his order, in England. I &s;uppo&s;e none will be
&s;urpri&s;ed to hear, that the people, of England &s;hould have &s;o ju&s;t a
value for the kingdom of Ireland, as never to be induced to re&s;ign the
intere&s;t they had in it. The rea&s;ons are too many and too obvious to
trouble your lord&s;hip with them. I &s;hall only tell you, that the King
promi&s;es, in the fore&s;aid declaration, to re&s;tore the &s;ettlement; but, at
the &s;ame time, declares, that he will recompence all tho&s;e who may &s;uffer
by it, by giving them equivalents. I mean tho&s;e who have &s;erved him;
and not only tho&s;e here, but all who were included in the capitulation
of Limerick, which will be a better &s;ecurity for them, than what they
have by the acts of the Dublin parliament, con&s;idering the many cir|cum&s;tances.
I do not doubt but your lord&s;hip is fully convinced of this
truth; and it will be a great &s;ervice to the King to convince others of
it, which, I hope, will be no difficult matter. For there is no man of
common &s;en&s;e but will think him&s;elf engaged, by intere&s;t as well as
duty, to contribute to his Maje&s;ty's re&s;toration; which, without the
concurrence of the greate&s;t part of his &s;ubjects, is impracticable. This
I have &s;aid by the King's command; and I &s;hall only add from my&s;elf,
that I haue been, the&s;e twenty-three years, mo&s;t &s;incerely,</P>

All founded on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs in England.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tran&s;lation.</HEAD>
<P>AS all the memorials which have been pre&s;ented to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
Maje&s;ty, concerning the affairs of the King of Great Britain, have
no other view but the common intere&s;ts of their Maje&s;ties; and as it is
ju&s;t, that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty &s;hould con&s;ider, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance,
his own advantage; this gives more courage to repre&s;ent, from time to
time, to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, with all the humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
imaginable, what is u&s;eful for his &s;ervice, and for the intere&s;t of his
Britannic Maje&s;ty. All the advantages which his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty
has obtained over the confederates, however great they have been, have
not yet been able to oblige them to a&s;k for peace, or di&s;&s;olve their alli|ance.
The prince of Orange is the author of this war, and the chief
of the union of the confederates.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t effectual means of breaking this alliance is to attack the
prince of Orange, on his weake&s;t &s;ide, which is England. The pro|babilities
of &s;ucceeding, in this undertaking, are the little good under|&s;tanding
which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between him and the people of England; the
contempt of the Engli&s;h for his per&s;on, and their little re&s;pect for his
government; the great change which has taken place in the minds of
the people; the great inclination which appears for re&s;toring the King,
and the daily increa&s;e of both the one and the other; the great number
of men of quality who engage every day in his Maje&s;ty's intere&s;ts, and
even of men who have influence, and who are employed by the prince
of Orange in the highe&s;t offices; the great di&s;content which prevails in
the fleet and army; the intelligence which the King has in garri&s;ons, in
<PB N="448" REF="468">
the army, and al&s;o in the fleet; and, above all, the conde&s;cen&s;ion which
his Maje&s;ty has had to promi&s;e to his people whatever they a&s;k, for the
&s;ecurity of their religion, their fortunes, and their privileges, with which
the &s;ubjects, generally &s;peaking, are highly &s;atisfied. The&s;e are the ge|neral
rea&s;ons for believing that his Britannic Maje&s;ty might &s;ucceed, if he
was in England with an army of thirty thou&s;and men, to protect his
friends, and to give the well-affected liberty to declare them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The great utility of this, as well to the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, as to
his Britannic Maje&s;ty, is &s;o inconte&s;tible, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to men|tion
it. The conjuncture &s;eems favourale for fini&s;hing the war, con|&s;idering
the great &s;uperiority which his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty has over
the maritime forces of the enemy this year. During which, if nothing
is attempted, there is rea&s;on to fear, that the next year, the prince of
Orange, by applying him&s;elf to operations at &s;ea, may make it more
difficult to tran&s;port the troops hereafter, than it appears to be, at pre|&s;ent.
Be&s;ides that, the delay will di&s;courage the King's friends in Eng|land,
who expect him, and encourage his enemies, who fear him.</P>
<P>The end of &s;ummer is more proper for this attempt, than the &s;pring
or autumn. For, in &s;ummer, the prince of Orange will be obliged to
abandon England to his coun&s;ellors or to leave Flanders. If he does
the fir&s;t, we have for us the principal coun&s;ellors of the prince&s;s of
Orange, who governs; and the commanders of the fleet, who will be
encouraged, by his Maje&s;ty's approach, and by the ab&s;ence of the prince
of Orange, to execute more boldly what his Maje&s;ty &s;hall demand of
them. If the prince of Orange leaves Flanders, his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty
may take advantage of this, and drive the confederates before him;
which he cannot do either in &s;pring or in autumn, on account of the
forage and roads, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The expence will not be con&s;iderable, becau&s;e the expence of the fleet,
which is the greate&s;t, is already laid out; the magazines are at hand, and
the troops, which are already along on the coa&s;t, are &s;ufficient for the
purpo&s;e; and would be then unnece&s;&s;ary on the coa&s;t. The affair may
be done, with the con&s;ent of the Engli&s;h admirals, if they mean to con|tribute
to the de&s;ign; and, in &s;pite of the Engli&s;h fleet, if they will not
<PB N="449" REF="469">
con&s;ent to it. The &s;ure&s;t way is to prepare for the wor&s;t, notwith&s;tand|ing
their promi&s;es. His Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty is to con&s;ider, if it
would not be proper to make the nece&s;&s;ary preparations in&s;tantly; and,
by making them publickly, without declaring any thing, to leave others
to judge, that he is to &s;end back the King of England to his dominions;
which, when publickly believed, may have very good effects.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It would be no &s;ooner publi&s;hed in Holland and in England,
than the expectation, which the people have of a de&s;cent in France,
would turn to the prejudice of the prince of Orange, who has hitherto
derived great reputation therefrom, throughout all Europe.</P>
<P>Secondly, It would encourage the faithful &s;ubjects of his Britannic
Maje&s;ty in England, who have always objected to us, that, if there was
any likelihood of what year and &s;ea&s;on his Maje&s;ty would come, they
would prepare them&s;elves. But, to prepare them&s;elves, without &s;eeing
any appearance of being &s;upported, and to expo&s;e them&s;elves thereby to
all the rigour of the laws again&s;t them, was not rea&s;onable either for
them or for us. Be&s;ides that, many would declare them&s;elves, when
their deliverance is near, who would not do &s;o, when they &s;aw it at a
di&s;tance, and that would greatly interrupt the peace of England, which
is already much di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It would encourage the Engli&s;h officers and &s;oldiers, who are
irritated again&s;t the prince of Orange, both in Flanders and on board the
fleet, and would encourage the admirals to execute their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Fourthly, It would oblige the prince of Orange to pretend either to
believe actually, that the King is to return to England, or not to be|lieve
it. If his affairs are in &s;uch a bad &s;ituation as we believe, he will
have a difficulty in &s;eeming to believe a de&s;cent in England, becau&s;e he
will di&s;credit him&s;elf, by acknowledging that he had threatened a thing,
which he was not in a condition to perform; and that France, even by
his own confe&s;&s;ion is in a condition to do what he could only threaten,
and thereby he will give us time to execute the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>If, on the contrary, he pretends to believe the de&s;ign is real, he mu&s;t
&s;till abandon either England or Flanders, as has been ob&s;erved already.
If he &s;ends the Engli&s;h to England, there is rea&s;on to believe we &s;hall
have as &s;trong a party there as he will, con&s;idering the di&s;content of
<PB N="450" REF="470">
&s;ome, and the corre&s;pondence which we hold with others, who are well
affected. If he &s;ends &s;trangers to England, he mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
evacuate Flanders; and the Engli&s;h will not &s;uffer them in their coun|try.
In all events, the prince of Orange will be &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed, that it
cannot fail to produce an effect very favourable to us.</P>
<P>What may be objected is, that this would de&s;troy the Kind's friends:
for they would be hara&s;&s;ed, impri&s;oned, &amp;c. But, to this, it is an&s;wered,
that it is not credible, that the prince of Orange would do &s;o, if he did
not believe the de&s;ign was real For that would augment the di&s;content,
which is already very great; and he will do &s;o &s;till le&s;s if he pretends
not to believe the de&s;ign: for he would thereby give a convincing proof
of the reality of his apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>If he believes the de&s;ign, and prepares him&s;elf to oppo&s;e it, we have
his coun&s;ellors to advi&s;e him not to provoke &s;o many families of rank;
and, at the wor&s;t, he can hurt only friends who are known, and have
taken oaths, and who compo&s;e but a &s;mall proportion of his Maje&s;ty's
party.</P>
<P>The be&s;t of all is, that preparations do not oblige his Maje&s;ty to pro|ceed.
For, if the conjuncture is not found favourable, his Maje&s;ty may
delay the affair, without any inconveniencies; and, if preparations were
not made, one could not &s;eize the mo&s;t favourable conjuncture that
could offer. By a favourable conjuncture is under&s;tood, &s;ome great &s;uc|ce&s;s,
by &s;ea or by land, in Germany or in Flanders, which might furni&s;h
an opportunity of detaching the nece&s;&s;ary number of troops: a thing,

It is of importance not to allow another parliament to meet. For
there is rea&s;on to fear, that it will grant money to the prince of Orange,
though not enough, perhaps, for his exigencies, as happened this year.
He will, however, have enough to continue the war; for he will not
want means of corrupting &s;ome; and improving upon the conce&s;&s;ions of
his Britannic Maje&s;ty, he will cajol others, which may be the means of
continuing the war: and, perhaps, they will grant him a general exci&s;e,
with which he will not only be in a condition to continue the war &s;everal
years, without burdening the people, but likewi&s;e to augment his forces
very con&s;iderably by &s;ea and land.</P>
<P>The Smyrna fleet may furni&s;h another favourable conjuncture, and

he is to addre&s;s any thing to the parliament; and, if he be to &s;end any
thing, what the nature of it &s;hould be: and if it may not be nece&s;&s;ary
for the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, now that his arms are &s;o victorious, to &s;end
&s;omething to &s;hew the people, that he de&s;ires no more but to &s;ee the

therefore wi&s;h them timely to think of what is the only expedient of end|ing
their troubles, to witt, the King's re&s;toration.</P>

of their bi&s;hops writes to me, four parts in five are ready to join the
<PB N="460" REF="480">
King, or to preach in their churches to &s;tir up the people in his favour;
500 of them having been ready to join him la&s;t year, in order
to convince prote&s;tants, that their religion was in no danger, and in
order to preach their &s;entiments to the inhabitants of the country, thro'
which the King &s;hould pa&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;His Maje&s;ty has the cities of Exeter and of Bri&s;tol, two of the large&s;t
in the kingdom, in readine&s;s to declare for him. He is a&s;&s;ured of the
garri&s;ons of Hull, Tilbury, and Languard. He has already formed and
armed from 3 to 4000 hor&s;e and dragoons, a number or the nobility
and of the riche&s;t merchants in London, and the militia of &s;everal coun|tries;
all the&s;e are ready to declare them&s;elves, on the fir&s;t notice.</P>
<P>&startq;Be&s;ides, his Maje&s;ty has the two admirals, who command the fleet, and
who are in corre&s;pondence with him, and from whom his Maje&s;ty may
expert every advantage. Fir&s;t, they have been trained by his Maje&s;ty
and owe their fortunes to him, and expect more from him than the
prince of Orange will ever give them, and therefore, they have greater
expectations from his Maje&s;ty; moreover, they hate the prince of
Orange, on account of the in&s;olence, of which they think he has been
guilty towards the nation; and la&s;tly, they have rea&s;on to fear they will
be &s;acrificed to the parliament, in order to &s;ave the prince of Orange, who
will not fail to blame them for the lo&s;s of the Smyrna fleet. Delaval
depends entirely upon the King, and Killigrew, the &s;econd in command,
depends on the earl of Danby, who is for the King.</P>
<P>&startq;I do not enter into a particular detail of his Maje&s;ty's hopes of having
a con&s;iderable part of the prince of Orange's army, as the &s;econd com|pany
of the body-guards, the royal regiment of cavalry, a part of the
Queen's regiment, the fir&s;t regiment of guards, Bath's regiment of In|fantry,
Selwin's regiment, &amp;c. be&s;ides a great number of officers or all
the other corps; when it is to be again con&s;idered, that if a de&s;ertion is
once begun among the Engli&s;h troops, they will all come over to his Ma|je&s;ty,
as they all abandoned him.</P>
<P>&startq;The earl of Danby, who is entirely for us, is lord lieutenant of the
county of York, which is the large&s;t county in England. He is governor
al&s;o of the town and citadel of Hull, of which, con&s;equently, his Maje&s;ty
is ma&s;ter whenever he choo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="481">
&startq;The earl of Abington is lord lieutenant of the county of Oxford, and
he is entirely for the King, and con&s;equently, the militia of that county
will be either for the King, or of no advantage to the prince of Orange,
and will not hinder the pa&s;&s;age of his Maje&s;ty's friends, who will choo&s;e
to join him. The earl of Lind&s;ay is in the &s;ame &s;tation, in the county of
Lincoln.</P>
<P>&startq;It is true, there are not convincing proofs of all this; but as his mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty does not think proper to hazard any thing in this affair with|out
having a greater &s;ecurity, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould let us know the
&s;tate, in which he choo&s;es that England &s;hould be, to induce him to make
a de&s;cent; and, at the &s;ame time, it is nece&s;&s;ary to conde&s;cend on the
proofs which his Maje&s;ty would choo&s;e to have to convince him, that
England is in the &s;tate in which he would have it, in order that his
Britannick Maje&s;ty may urge his friends in England, to put affairs in the
po&s;ture required, and to furni&s;h him with the proofs that will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for him: for it is impo&s;&s;ible to continue the manoeuvres we have
practi&s;ed in time pa&s;t, of taking the proper mea&s;ures in England,
during the winter, for receiving the King in the &s;pring, and not being
then in a condition to take advantage of the conjuncture, to employ the
&s;ummer in making preparations for the autumn, and the autumn and
winter for the en&s;uing &s;pring; at lea&s;t, unle&s;s we know that his mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty will be then in a condition to avail him&s;elf of our
preparations; for it is impo&s;&s;ible but the prince of Orange will di&s;cover
his Maje&s;ty's friends at la&s;t, and ruin them.&endq;</P>
<P>From hence the writer of the letter infers the nece&s;&s;ity of concerting the
plan and fixing the time of the inva&s;ion. He &s;hows, at full length, that
the pre&s;ent conjuncture is favourable, and that the de&s;ign is as much for the
intere&s;t of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty as of the King of England; and,
that the execution of it hath been hitherto prevented, by the artful mi&s;|repre&s;entations
of the prince of Orange, who concealed his weakne&s;s, and
publi&s;hed &s;uch fal&s;e accounts of his forces, by &s;ea and land, as might
render the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterprize uncertain. He &s;hows likewi&s;e, that
England, unle&s;s it is invaded, will be able to continue the war.</P>
<P>&startq;Scotland,&endq; he &s;ays, &startq;being more oppre&s;&s;ed by the prince of Orange,
is more ready to take vigorous re&s;olutions, and is now in the mo&s;t favour|able
condition that can be imagined, to ri&s;e in arms. More than a
<PB N="462" REF="482">
hundred per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality in the country, have cho&s;en rather
to pay their revenues for a year, and be pri&s;oners to the prince of Orange,
than to take the oaths of allegiance, which he a&s;ked. Therefore, far
from furni&s;hing any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the prince of Orange, Scotland would
revolt and make a con&s;iderable diver&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>The writer of the letter mentions &s;everal &s;ymptoms of a general di&s;|content
in Britain, &s;ince the lo&s;s of the Smyrna fleet and the battle in Flander$,
which he infers from the complaint of the merchants to Queen Mary,
and from the city of London's refu&s;ing to advance money to King
William in his greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ities. &startq;Moreover, tho&s;e who have mo&s;t credit
with him, want now to capitulate with his Maje&s;ty, and tho&s;e who
have a con&s;iderable &s;hare in the government, have entreated the King to
pardon them; fore&s;eeing, as they &s;ay them&s;elves, that his government
cannot la&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>He, in the next place, obviates all the objections, again&s;t &s;ending an
army of 30,000 men to England, particularly on account of the quantity
of &s;pecie, which would be &s;ent to maintain them, in ca&s;e the King &s;hould
be defeated as &s;oon as he landed. &startq;But,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;if the King has time
to join his friends, there is great rea&s;on to hope, that he will have money
to pay his troops; &s;everal of the prince of Orange's collectors having
promi&s;ed him to keep con&s;iderable &s;ums, provided they can know ex|actly,
when his Maje&s;ty will come. There is one of tho&s;e collectors at
Bri&s;tol, who, la&s;t year, had 100,000<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling, in ready money to give
the King, if he had gone over from La Hogue; and he kept that money
as long as there were any hopes of his landing. Therefore, although his
Maje&s;ty cannot venture to make a de&s;cent, without having &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
for his army for &s;ix weeks after his arrival in England; yet it is to be
hoped, that he may &s;ave the money of France and return it in &s;pecie
directly.&endq;</P>
<P>The remaining part of the letter concerns the proper place for landing;
and after &s;ome further arguments for an immediate inva&s;ion, concludes in
the&s;e words: &startq;I have now told you, Sir, a part of what I had to &s;ay on
the &s;ubject, to engage his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty to turn his attention
a little towards England. But it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;peak on the
&s;ubject, &s;o as to per&s;uade, unle&s;s I knew the objections. I therefore,
be&s;eech you to contrive, that we may &s;peak freely and at lei&s;ure with the
<PB N="463" REF="483">
French mini&s;ters, in order that they may debate the affair and tell us
their objections, and that we may be in&s;tructed by their knowledge; be|cau&s;e
it is not only our intere&s;t, with regard to his Britannick Maje&s;ty,
who&s;e re-e&s;tabli&s;hment is our fir&s;t and principal motive; but al&s;o becau&s;e
all our hopes, our families, our po&s;terity, and, what is &s;till more dear
to us, our reputation, depend upon the &s;ucce&s;s of this affair. There|fore,
it may be ea&s;ily believed, that, if we cannot &s;urmount difficulties,
we &s;hall be very well plea&s;ed not to engage our&s;elves in danger.&endq;</P>
<P>The writer of the preceding letter wrote according to the in|formation
which was &s;ent to James from his friends in England,
as appears from the account given of the opinions of &s;ome of them in the
following paper. It is indor&s;ed in the earl of Melfort's hand, &startq;A draught

intended it for the information of the French mini&s;try. The paper it&s;elf

<P>&startq;THE earl of Clarendon has commi&s;&s;ioned me to tell your Maje&s;ty,
that, at any time within three months, your Maje&s;ty may make
a de&s;cent with &s;ucce&s;s. But that your affairs will &s;uffer by a longer de|lay,
your friends will be ruined, and it will be difficult to find again &s;uch
a favourable conjuncture.</P>
<P>&startq;The earl of Litchfield &s;ays, that he an&s;wers to your Maje&s;ty for the
county of Oxford, as lord Lind&s;ay does for the county of Lincoln, and
that your Maje&s;ty may depend upon colonel Brewer's regiment; that
there is no time to be lo&s;t, and, that people in general are not willing to
engage them&s;elves in your Maje&s;ty's cau&s;e, but in the hopes that your
Maje&s;ty will come &s;oon.</P>
<P>&startq;The earl of Yarmouth &s;ays, that the proper time for your Maje&s;ty to
come, is after the departure of the fleet for the Streights and of the troops
<PB N="464" REF="484">
for Flanders. He &s;howed me a li&s;t of the principal per&s;ons of the
county of Norwich, who have promi&s;ed to declare for your Maje&s;ty.
He has likewi&s;e &s;ecured the city of Norwich for your Maje&s;ty; and he
wi&s;hes, if it be po&s;&s;ible, that your Maje&s;ty may have the Mare&s;chal de
Luxembourg to command the army you bring along with you.</P>
<P>Lord Mountgomery affirms, that the mo&s;t proper time for a de&s;cent
is, between this and the month of March; and that, if your Maje&s;ty
puts it off to a more di&s;tant period, the delay may be of dangerous con|&s;equence;
but, that your Maje&s;ty coming then, with 30,000 men, cannot
fail of &s;ucce&s;s, the nation in general being well di&s;po&s;ed, and if they are
not for, they will not, at lea&s;t, be again&s;t your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Colonel Graham &s;ays, that your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t infallibly &s;ucceed, if you
come any time before the month of March.</P>
<P>Sir John Friend &s;ays, that he an&s;wers to your Maje&s;ty for two regi|ments
of militia, in the Tower Hamlets, and, that he will join your
Maje&s;ty with a regiment of cavalry, and that he does not doubt, but
your Maje&s;ty will accompli&s;h the de&s;ign of your enterprize, if you come
with 30,000 men.</P>
<P>Sir John Fenwick, Sir Forre&s;ter, and &s;everal other gentlemen, are
unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that your Maje&s;ty may delay your coming too
long, and can never come too &s;oon; and it is their opinions in general,
that it is not proper to come with le&s;s than 30,000 men, a good train
of artillery, and &s;ome arms for your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, who will join
you at your landing. Lord Arran believes, that your Maje&s;ty never
had &s;uch a favourable opportunity as at pre&s;ent, providing you come
with an army of 30,000 men, and he advi&s;es to &s;end &s;ome troops to
Scotland likewi&s;e, if it can be done.</P>
<P>The earl of Breadalbin believes, that the parliament will take the
management of the fleet into their own hand, and that they will render
it very formidable, in order to be in a condition to obtain a favourable
compo&s;ition for them&s;elves, in ca&s;e the con&s;ederacy &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved.
He is likewi&s;e of opinion, that it is proper to &s;end &s;ome troops to Scot|land,
and intreats your Maje&s;ty to acquaint him, if you choo&s;e that he
&s;hould go to Scotland.</P>

<P><PB N="465" REF="485">
Fergu&s;on told me, that the Engli&s;h will have this year a very power|ful
fleet, commanded by men in whom the prince of Orange places con|&s;idence;
that they will change their lord lieutenants of counties, and
particularly the lieutenancy of London and the officers of the militia,
and that all the power will be placed in the hands of the pre&s;bterians,
who will adhere to the prince of Orange, and, that their intention is to
have this &s;ummer, a fleet of &s;ixty Engli&s;h, and forty Dutch &s;hips of the
line; and he intreats your Maje&s;ty to beware of tho&s;e, who advi&s;e you

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Captain William&s;on's Memorial.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;THE earl of Clarendon entreats your Maje&s;ty to take the proper pre|cautions
for making a de&s;cent before the Spring, as the prince
of Orange de&s;igns to &s;end a powerful fleet to the Streights, and to leave
the channel unguarded all Winter, which will facilitate your Maje&s;ty's
pa&s;&s;age; and your Maje&s;ty may depend upon finding, after you land,
&s;ufficient &s;u&s;tenance for your troops every where in the barns of the
farmers, and your Maje&s;ty needs not to doubt, but your &s;ubjects will
chearfully return to their duty, provided your Maje&s;ty comes with a
force &s;ufficient to protect them: a &s;ufficient force is &s;uppo&s;ed to be
30,000 men.</P>
<P>The lord Mountgomery be&s;eeches your Maje&s;ty not to lo&s;e the op|portunity
which now offers, of making a de&s;cent, as &s;oon as you can be
ready; &s;ince there is no winter fleet in the channel, which can oppo&s;e your
Maje&s;ty's pa&s;&s;age, and your Maje&s;ty will find a people well di&s;po&s;ed to
receive you, providing you come with a force &s;ufficient to protect them.
Thirty thou&s;and men is the number which we earne&s;tly wi&s;h your Maje&s;ty
may bring along with you, with arms for &s;everal of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects,
who will infallibly join you; and the &s;ooner your Maje&s;ty under|takes
this expedition, the more certain you will be of &s;ucce&s;s; for the
prince of Orange will have a powerful fleet next Spring, and will &s;end it
early to &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="486">
The earl of Ayle&s;bury intreats your Maje&s;ty not to let &s;lip this Winter
&s;ea&s;on; but to endeavour to prevail with his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty to a&s;&s;i&s;t
you with his troops, in order that you may be able to make a de&s;cent in
the Spring, at the late&s;t. This expedition will, in all probability, break
the league, which is &s;upported, in a great mea&s;ure, by the men and the
money of England. Your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects are extremely well di&s;po&s;ed,
and will, undoubtedly, return to their duty, providing your Maje&s;ty
comes with a &s;ufficient force. Thirty thou&s;and men is all they demand,
with &s;ome arms for tho&s;e who will join your Maje&s;ty upon landing; and
the &s;ooner your Maje&s;ty comes, when the wind and the &s;ea&s;on permits you,
the better.</P>
<P>The earl of Yarmouth be&s;eeches your Maje&s;ty, to obtain from the mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian King, troops for making a de&s;cent, before the prince of Orange's
fleet can be ready; which will be very early in the Spring. His opinion
is, that it will be more &s;afe for your Maje&s;ty to come after the parlia|ment
is fini&s;hed, than when it is &s;itting, le&s;t the prince of Orange &s;hould
oblige them to take &s;ome &s;teps, which might be prejudicial to your
Maje&s;ty; but, as this is only his private opinion, he &s;ubmits it to your
Maje&s;ty's better judgment<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The pen is drawn through he la&s;t &s;entence, in the manu&s;cript.</NOTE>. He wi&s;hes your Maje&s;ty may land with
30,000 men; the people being &s;o di&s;po&s;ed at pre&s;ent, that, with that
number, your Maje&s;ty cannot po&s;&s;ibly fail to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>The earl of Arran intreats your Maje&s;ty not to delay, by any means, to
make a de&s;cent later than the Spring. It is his opinion, that your Ma|je&s;ty
will meet with very little re&s;i&s;tance, if you land with 30,000 men;
the Engli&s;h being now &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, that he believes it is impo&s;&s;ible
the enterprise can fail.</P>
<P>Sir Theophilus Oglethorp wi&s;hes your Maje&s;ty may make a de&s;cent,
at the late&s;t, in the &s;pring, with 30,000 men, which will be a &s;ufficient
force for vanqui&s;hing all your enemies, for protecting your friends, and
for conducting your Maje&s;ty, in &s;afety, to Whitehall. That number of
troops will oblige both the fleet and army to return to their duty; the
latter being already well di&s;po&s;ed, and wanting only a &s;uperior force to
put it in their power to join it.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="487">
Sir John Friend de&s;ires, with much earne&s;tne&s;s, that your Maje&s;ty
may make a de&s;cent, at farthe&s;t, in the &s;pring; your Maje&s;ty's faithful
&s;ubjects, who have been very active in your &s;ervice, and who are ready
to join you, the moment you arrive, being in great danger of being
ruined, and of wanting the power of being of further u&s;e to your Ma|je&s;ty,
if you delay to come at this time. As for him&s;elf, he engages to
bring to your Maje&s;ty a good regiment of cavalry, at your landing; and
he has great influence over the two regiments of the militia, de&s;tined for
the defence of the Tower; and he has great hopes, by the&s;e means, to
po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the Tower of London; as he does not doubt but the
prince of Orange will withdraw all the veteran troops from London to
oppo&s;e your Maje&s;ty. He will join to his regiment a company of clergy|men
of the church of England, who are determined to &s;erve as volun|teers
in this expedition, as are in fact the majority of the clergy, who
have not taken the oaths, and al&s;o many of tho&s;e who have taken them.
He hopes al&s;o, by a &s;tratagem, to &s;eize the prince and prince&s;s of Orange,
and to bring them to your Maje&s;ty<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The pen is drawn through the la&s;t &s;entence in the MS.</NOTE> Thirty thou&s;and men is all that

declaration, and by the taxes with which the prince of Orange oppre&s;&s;es
them, di&s;po&s;ed to join your Maje&s;ty, providing you come to them with
an army of 30,000 men, which will be &s;ufficient to protect them: for,
as this is an enterprize which cannot be attempted twice, they are de|&s;irous
to undertake it with &s;afety. With regard to forrage for the troops,
all the barns and garrets in the country are full of it, at this &s;ea&s;on;
and, if the winter is allowed to pa&s;s, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to undertake
this enterprize, when there is forrage in the fields; becau&s;e the Engli&s;h

Mr. Stroude de&s;ires, that your Maje&s;ty may make a de&s;cent, and has

of that county, will infallibly take arms and declare for your Ma|je&s;ty,
the moment they receive advice of your landing: that your Ma|je&s;ty's

&s;uch a manner, that this expedition cannot fail to have a happy i&s;&s;ue:
that thirty thou&s;and men will be &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h this great work;
and that, with that number, according to all human appearance, your
Maje&s;ty will be &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Mr. Fe$gu&s;on wi&s;hes, that your Maje&s;ty may not let pa&s;s the &s;pring,
without making a de&s;cent in England; it being impo&s;&s;ible that the prince
of Orange can &s;upport him&s;elf, when your Maje&s;ty comes in compe|tition
with him, the people being already much di&s;gu&s;ted with his go|vernment.
The Engli&s;h would choo&s;e to be quit of him; but that will
not be in their power, unle&s;s your Maje&s;ty comes to deliver them, with
an army of 30,000 men, and with arms for &s;uch of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects

give him&s;elf up, in any place in France your Maje&s;ty choo&s;es, in order
to be &s;acrificed, if the enterprize fails; and the &s;ooner it is undertaken,
the more certain will be the &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Penn &s;ays, that your Maje&s;ty has had &s;everal occa&s;ions, but never
any &s;o favourable as the pre&s;ent; and he hopes, that your Maje&s;ty will
be earne&s;t with the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King not to neglect it: that a de&s;cent,
with 30,000 men, will not only re-e&s;tabli&s;h your Maje&s;ty, but, accord|ing
to all appearance, break the league: that your Maje&s;ty's kingdoms
will be wretched while the confederates are united; for while there is a
fool in England, the prince of Orange will have a pen&s;ioned parliament,

<P>Since Sir John Lytcott's return from Rome, James had none to re|pre&s;ent
him at that court. Cardinal Norfolk and bi&s;hop Ellis, without
being inve&s;ted with a public character, took care of his intere&s;t, and
corre&s;ponded with his mini&s;ters from time to time.</P>

<P>23d December, 1692. HE writes, that the Pope had already laid out a great

<P>13th January, 1693. His attempts to get money have been hitherto
un&s;ucce&s;sful. He propo&s;es the preferment of different mi&s;&s;ionaries, and

<P>MR. Crawford, governor of the fort of Sheerne&s;s, promi&s;ed, &s;ome time

<P>In the royal regiment of cavalry there are a hundred troopers, who
have acquainted the King, that they have credit enough in the regiment
to be able to an&s;wer for bringing over the whole regiment to him; and
that they will cut the throats of &s;uch of their comrades or officers
who will make oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above, there are al&s;o the friends whom the King has in the
north of England, who are very numerous; and where there are formed
&s;even regiments of cavalry and dragoons, for which commi&s;&s;ions have
been given, and who will be ready to join his Maje&s;ty when he lands.
An account of them is expected by an expre&s;s, which colonel Parker,

<P>THE earl of Sunderland writes to his Maje&s;ty, that a de&s;cent is the
only means to fini&s;h the misfortunes of the King and tho&s;e of the
nation; and that if his Maje&s;ty comes now with an army, he cannot fail
to carry his point. He does not enter into particulars, becau&s;e he

when he is a&s;&s;ured that the King is &s;atisfied with h$s fidelity, he pro|mi&s;es
to &s;end good intelligence, and to contribute as much as he can to
his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The earl of Arran a&s;&s;ures his maje&s;ty of the &s;incerity of lord Sun|derland,
and that he may be of great &s;ervice; and he al&s;o advi&s;es his
Maje&s;ty to go to England, with an army of 30,000 men, with which his
Maje&s;ty cannot fail to &s;ucceed, providing he comes immediately, to take
advantage of the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, of their contempt for the
prince of Orange, and of their di&s;content, on account of the taxes with
which they are loaded. The circum&s;tances are the mo&s;t favourable that
can be for facilitating the pa&s;&s;age, as well as the landing of his Maje&s;ty's
troops; &s;ince the fleet &s;ails to the Streights, the greate&s;t part of the troops

we did not doubt, but that we &s;hould draw a benefit from the an&s;wers,
&s;uitable to the trouble we gave them, and the danger we made them
incur.</P>
<P>You are to let them know, that it was not only for our own inform|ation,
that we de&s;ired the&s;e an&s;wers, but at the de&s;ire of the mo&s;t Chri&s;|tian

what Holland, upon &s;uch an alarm as our preparing to land, might fur|ni&s;h,
that it has put it out of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King's power, at this

<P>You &s;hall let them know, that this delay is a greater di&s;appointment

<P>HAving con&s;idered Mr. Cro&s;s's in&s;tructions, and your incomparable
letter of the 17th In&s;tant, with what Mr. Cro&s;s has be&s;ides told us
verbally, we are of opinion, that his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice and our own duty
require of us to &s;end you our &s;entiments upon the whole.</P>
<P>We know very well the difficulties of tran&s;porting 30,000 men, the
extraordinary number of tran&s;ports nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o large an army, and
that the great expence of this expedition cannot fail to be a little bur|den&s;ome
to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, at a conjuncture when he has &s;o
many other affairs on hand; yet when we &s;ent Mr. Cro&s;s, we were then
<PB N="478" REF="498">
of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> that we could not, with &s;afety to the King, propo&s;e a &s;maller
number of troops.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e we could not then depend altogether &s;o much upon the
good di&s;po&s;ition of the nation, as we have rea&s;on to do &s;ince; for the
greate&s;t number of tho&s;e who do not act from a pure principle of loyalty,
were not willing to declare them&s;elves, until they believed that the ex|pedition
was ready to take place; and then they communicated them|&s;elves
to us: from which we conclude, that the King's party in Eng|land
is much &s;tronger than we ventured to affirm. Be&s;ides, the nation
&s;eems to expect his Maje&s;ty with impatience, which is an argument of
their di&s;po&s;ition to join him, which could not appear to us, at that time,
to have the force we &s;ee it has at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Secondly, We could not fore&s;ee then, that the prince of Orange
would refu&s;e the popular bill concerning impartial procceedings in par|liament,
which has created a number of enemies to him, and has aug|mented
con&s;iderably the number of the King's friends.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We could not then judge exactly what number of troops
would remain in England; and, in order that the enterpri&s;e might be
the &s;afer, we judged it was proper to propo&s;e a greater, rather than a
&s;maller number; and &s;o the number of troops we then propo&s;ed was
greater than we believed to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>&startq;But having con&s;idered what you write to us in your letter, that
there would be hopes of per&s;uading his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty to hazard
the enterpri&s;e, in ca&s;e we would content our&s;elves with 20,000 men<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The pen is drawn in the MS. through the pa&s;&s;age in inverted commas.</NOTE>,&endq;
we believe, for the rea&s;ons mentioned above, that if the King can come
with 20,000 men, there is, in the pre&s;ent conjuncture, a moral certainty
of &s;ucce&s;s; and, in order to confirm our opinion in this re&s;pect, we have
thought it was proper to &s;end you the &s;tate of the fleet and of the army.</P>
<P>By the &s;tate of the fleet you will &s;ee, that we cannot have at &s;ea more
than twenty-five &s;ail of third and fourth rates before the month of
April; and even the&s;e &s;hips cannot be compleatly manned. So that, if
France could &s;end thirty &s;hips of war before that time, they would be
ma&s;ters of the &s;ea, and, according to all appearances, nothing could
hinder them from making a de&s;cent.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="499">
And, by the &s;tate of the army, it appears likewi&s;e, that we have not
at pre&s;ent more than 7, 500 men; and when all the troops de&s;tined for
Flanders are embarked, there will not remain above 4000 in England.
Con&s;equently there is no oppo&s;ition to be apprehended, at pre&s;ent, from
the land forces; much le&s;s, when tho&s;e which are to go abroad &s;hall
embark. This confirms our fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertion, that twenty thou&s;and men
will be &s;ufficient; &s;ince even a &s;maller number, according to all ap|pearances,
cannot fail to &s;ucceed, from the manner in which things are
now arranged.</P>
<P>This is what we have thought proper to repre&s;ent to you, and to in|treat
you to con&s;ider well; hoping that the King our ma&s;ter and his mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty will be plea&s;ed to concert new mea&s;ures together
upon the&s;e reports which we &s;end you, and which we certify to be true.
At any rate, we di&s;charge our duty in &s;ending them; and we &s;ubmit
them entirely to you.</P>
<P>&startq;Although it is not to be imagined that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty
can change, at pre&s;ent, the plan which he has propo&s;ed to him&s;elf for

<P>Captain Floyd or Lloyd, a groom of the bed-chamber to James, had
carried on the communication between that prince and the earl of Marl|borough,
and admiral Ru&s;&s;el. The fir&s;t made no doubt of &s;ecuring the
army; the latter undertook for the fleet. Floyd al&s;o carried a letter from
the prince&s;s of Denmark to her father, at La Hogue, in the year 1692;
and he afterwards made &s;everal journeys to England; and one in par|ticular
to know from the adherents of James, what propo&s;als he might
make to the French King, upon the faith of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. When
Floyd returned to France, the accounts he gave, on the &s;ubject of his
commi&s;&s;ion, were tran&s;lated into French by the earl of Melfort, and
communicated to Lewis XIV. on the fir&s;t of May of the pre&s;ent year.

<OPENER>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty,</OPENER>
<P>BEING arrived in London, I &s;ent for major-general Sackville and
the re&s;t to whom I was directed by your Maje&s;ty, for facilitating my
acce&s;s to admiral Ru&s;&s;el, the earl of Shrew&s;bury, the counte&s;s of Shrew&s;|bury,
lord Churchill, and lord Godolphin: and the &s;aid Sackville, &amp;c.
having come to me, I gave them an account of the affairs, with which
I was intru&s;ted, and &s;howed them my in&s;tructions for con&s;ulting with
them about the manner I ought to take in treating with the&s;e noblemen.</P>
<P>They informed me, that I was come in the be&s;t conjuncture imagin|able,
becau&s;e the prince of Orange's party was greatly mortified for the
lo&s;s of the Smyrna fleet they lately &s;u&s;tained; whereas formerly they were
greatly elevated, believing, with certainty, that there was no de&s;ign of
making a de&s;cent in England this year, which they had much dreaded, and
being per&s;uaded, that France would &s;eek a peace with earne&s;tne&s;s, and
that your Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t would not be comprehended in it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on they brought me was lord Churchill, to whom I
&s;howed my in&s;tructions; at the &s;ame time informing him, that your Ma|je&s;ty,
having heard that he was to have an employment, had commanded
me to a&s;&s;ure him from you, that you was highly plea&s;ed at this, and
gave him your con&s;ent to accept of it, and left him at liberty to em|ploy
the propere&s;t means for obtaining it, having no doubts of his
fidelity, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Lord Churchill an&s;wered me, that it was true, that he had been &s;o|licited
&s;ome time ago to accept of an employment; but that he did not
choo&s;e to accept it without your Maje&s;ty's con&s;ent, which he had de|manded,
by the means of major-general Sackville, without whom he did
not move a &s;tep: that the affair was now pa&s;&s;ed, but, if it occurred again,
which might well happen, he would not accept, but from a de&s;ign of
&s;erving your Maje&s;ty; for who&s;e re-e&s;tabli&s;hment he was determined to
re&s;ign his life, for expiating his crimes, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="503">
The next evening, lord Churchill gave me an opportunity of meet|ing
admiral Ru&s;&s;el, who received me with a great deal of friend&s;hip. I
informed him of what I had to communicate to him from your Ma|je&s;ty,
in con&s;equence of the offers he had made to you by my&s;elf, as
well as by &s;everal others; and, in order to &s;ettle the means of executing
them, I acquainted him how gratefully your Maje&s;ty would acknowledge
it, if he would apply him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to the bu&s;ine&s;s. He an&s;wered
me, that he was always firm in his re&s;olution of doing all that depended
upon him for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of your Maje&s;ty: but that the thing
was very difficult to be accompli&s;hed; time was nece&s;&s;ary, which yet he
would manage in the be&s;t manner he could: but that he would con&s;ider
the affair, and, in two or three days, give me another rendezvous. We
parted then, very well &s;atisfied with one another: &startq;I having given him &s;ome
light, which he wanted, in certain affairs that intere&s;ted him greatly<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the MS. the pen is drawn through the words within the inverted commas.</NOTE>&endq;</P>
<P>I went to wait on the counte&s;s of Shrew&s;bury, who was &s;ick. I made
her the compliments I was ordered by your Maje&s;ty and the Queen. In
return to which &s;he an&s;wered me with all the &s;entiments of duty and
affection for your intere&s;ts. She afterwards told me, how her &s;on, the
earl of Shrew&s;bury, had been obliged to accept of an employment; the
prince of Orange having &s;ent for him, to offer him the po&s;t of &s;ecretary of
&s;tate, which he refu&s;ed, on account of his bad health. But the prince of
Orange &s;howed him, that he had a very different rea&s;on, by repeating to
him a di&s;cour&s;e which he had held about your Maje&s;ty. This &s;urpri&s;ed
the earl of Shrew&s;bury much, and convinced him of the danger of re|fu&s;ing
the employment; but, as he expected a de&s;cent in England in a
few days, he demanded &s;ome time to go to the country, on account of
his health and other pre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s, before he received the &s;eals. The
prince of Orange having granted this, he went to the country, accom|panied
by his friends, well mounted, with an intention of joining your
Maje&s;ty, in ca&s;e you had come as was expected and wi&s;hed. But that
having failed, to his great regret, he was obliged, on his return, to ac|cept
of the &s;eals; which, &s;he told me, from him, he did only in order
to &s;erve your Maje&s;ty more effectually hereafter.</P>
<P>Having met admiral Ru&s;&s;ell for the &s;econd time, I urged him much
about the contents of the letter that he had written to me before my
<PB N="482" REF="504">
departure, importing that, in ten days, he would explain him&s;elf further
to me concerning the time, the manner, and the place. He an&s;wered
me, that that was impo&s;&s;ible at pre&s;ent, things not being quite prepared
yet; but that he would accompli&s;h the de&s;ign if it was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I acquainted him, that I &s;hould be very &s;orry to bring back an an&s;wer
&s;o general; that one could not form any de&s;ign upon it; and that it was
nece&s;&s;ary to have a plan of what he was able or willing to do. On which
he an&s;wered me, that he thought he had &s;aid a great deal, &s;ince he had
&s;aid, that, by God, he would undertake it; that he would endeavour to
gain the officers of the fleet, and would communicate to lord Churchill,
from time to time, the progre&s;s he made. But, &s;ays he, if you was in
my place, what would you do? I an&s;wered him, that there were &s;everal
things to be done; viz. to avoid the French fleet, and allow it to pa&s;s. To
which he an&s;wered, that he would not do that, although it was once his
intentions: and that he would do the bu&s;ine&s;s, but &s;wore he would do it
him&s;elf alone. I propo&s;ed to him, that, &s;ince &s;ome de&s;ign would be
attempted infallibly upon the coa&s;t of France, this &s;ummer, which
would nece&s;&s;arily draw down troops to Bre&s;t, or to other places on the
coa&s;t, according to the de&s;igns upon them, he might &s;end your Maje&s;ty
information of this, and give you time to prepare tran&s;ports this &s;ummer;
and that, towards autumn, when it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;arm the large
&s;hips, and to &s;end convoys to America, &amp;c. he would be a judge of
tho&s;e which it would be proper to keep in the channel, and accordingly
might retain tho&s;e which he had gained in the &s;ummer, and either &s;end
the re&s;t into the harbours, or employ them as convoys; and being, by
the&s;e means, ma&s;ter of tho&s;e that remained, he might join the French to
tran&s;port the troops, which would be nece&s;&s;ary for accompanying your
Maje&s;ty into England.</P>
<P>He interrupted me &s;everal times. But, at la&s;t, being unwilling to de|termine
upon any plan, he prote&s;ted to me again in general, that he
would undertake the affair, and that lord Shrew&s;bury and lord Churchill
&s;hould be judges of his actions. He gave me repeated a&s;&s;urances of his
re&s;olution, and of his loyalty to your Maje&s;ty; and we took leave of one
another, as I &s;aw that I could not draw any thing more po&s;itive from
him.</P>
<P><PB N="483" REF="505">
I gave an account of all this to lord Churchill, Sackville, &amp;c. who
were all of opinion, that he had &s;aid a great deal, if one could tru&s;t him;
and, if one could not, that all he could &s;ay would have no more effect.</P>
<P>After this, I waited of lord Godolphin, who explained to me his &s;en|timents
towards your Maje&s;ty, in the mo&s;t affectionate manner imaginable.
He acquainted me, that there was too much room to fear a peace would
be concluded, this &s;ummer; and that they were &s;orry to believe, from
the manner in which the prince of Orange &s;poke of it, that the terms
would be prejudicial to your Maje&s;ty, &s;ince infallibly the prince would
endeavour thereby to oblige the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King to &s;end your Ma|je&s;ty
out of his dominions. That he thought it was his duty to acquaint
your Maje&s;ty of this. But that it was his opinion, that your Maje&s;ty, in
ca&s;e the peace was not concluded, &s;hould come over to England, but
with a con&s;iderable force: that it would not be difficult for the French
to make a de&s;cent in England, even without Ru&s;&s;ell, who ought, never|thele&s;s,
to be treated with attention, becau&s;e, in his opinion, he had &s;aid
all that could be expected of him, provided one would be &s;ure, that lord
Shrew&s;bury, whom he believed to be &s;incerely in his Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t,
had an entire influence over him: that Ru&s;&s;ell would infallibly appear
before Bre&s;t; the land-officers believing that the place may be in&s;ulted,
although the &s;ea-officers were of a different opinion: that this would give
a ju&s;t pretext to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, to &s;end troops to that place;
and that the nece&s;&s;ary number of tran&s;ports might be prepared this
&s;ummer: that the large ve&s;&s;els would return about the middle of au|tumn:
that the &s;ailors would be di&s;per&s;ed, the convoys &s;ent to the diffe|rent
places of commerce; and that the Engli&s;h would have a difficulty
in finding thirty ve&s;&s;els of tolerable force: that your Maje&s;ty, embracing
the proper time, might come over; and that he believed a blow would
not be &s;truck after you landed, as nine out of ten of the people of Eng|land
heartily dete&s;t the prince of Orange. He reiterated his prote&s;ta|tions,
with the greate&s;t loyalty to your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The counte&s;s of Shrew&s;bury informed me, that the prince of Orange
would go to Holland immediately after the prorogation of the parlia|ment;
that he would leave the government in the hands of the prince&s;s;
but that &s;he would entirely follow the advices of Danby and Shrew&s;bury.</P>

<P>YOURS of January the 15th I have received, wherein I am glad to
find, that you are recovered of the illne&s;s you have lately had. What
I mentioned concerning your brother George, his being to be employed,
was only a rumour, writ in a news-letter; and, as &s;uch, I told you of it.
But what you foretold of 322 [lord Murray] was better grounded. I
doubt not, but that he enters, in good earne&s;t, in the Pr. of Or. his
intere&s;t. But how long he will continue &s;o, will much depend upon
what he &s;hall think hereafter to be his own intere&s;t. But why 253
[lord Godolphin] &s;hould take pains to make a convert of him, I am yet
to find out the rea&s;on. What you &s;ay may well enough come to pa&s;s,
that 303 [Queen&s;bery], 315 [Tarbet], and 324 [Braidalbine], if they
be &s;en&s;ibly di&s;appointed, may turn about towards ME. But I &s;hall fol|low

<P>When the earl of Marlborough and his wife, by their influence with
the prince&s;s of Denmark, were accu&s;ed of fomenting differences between
the royal &s;i&s;ters, the earl, it now appears, was in corre&s;pondence with
the late King. William, probably, though he knew not particulars,
&s;u&s;pected in general the &s;ecret intrigues of Marlborough, when he &s;ent
him to the Tower, in the year 1692. James, from a diffidence of his
former favourite, required actions, as the proof of his &s;incerity. He
had done con&s;iderable &s;ervice to the party, before this period. But the
mo&s;t capital in&s;tance of his thorough repentance was the intelligence of
the de&s;ign again&s;t Bre&s;t, tran&s;mitted, by him, in the following letter to
James, inclo&s;ed in one, from colonel Sackville. Marlborough is &s;up|po&s;ed
to have had more de&s;igns than one, in this part of his conduct.
He wi&s;hed to &s;erve James with Lewis the Fourteenth, and to ruin gene|ral
Talma&s;h, as well as to be revenged of William. In King James's

<P>The meaning of the re&s;t of this letter is not obvious.</P>
<P>From the repre&s;entations of the late King's adherents, one would be
apt to imagine, that the nation to a man would join him, as &s;oon as he
landed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 123.</NOTE> But an anonymous letter to a friend at Paris, bearing date the
&s;eventeenth of Augu&s;t, 1694, gives a very different account of the &s;tate
of things in England.</P>
<P>The writer of this letter, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal folio pages, was
induced, by the different opinions which prevailed, concerning the power
and number of James's friends, to travel round the kingdom, that he
might be able to give a ju&s;t and &s;atisfactory account to the court of St.
Germains; and he &s;ent it in this letter, as he him&s;elf was prevented, by
an indi&s;po&s;ition, from going to France. He found, in general, he &s;aid,
that, if all who wi&s;hed James upon the throne were his friends, he had
undoubtedly more friends than foes in England; and that their number
was likely to increa&s;e every day, on account of their heavy taxes and
<PB N="489" REF="511">
other grievances, and their aver&s;ion from the reigning prince. He di&s;co|vered
this, from remarkable in&s;tances of indulgencies &s;hown to the Ja|cobites,
by the lords lieutenants and ju&s;tices of the peace, in the &s;everal
counties, and from the conver&s;ation of the gentlemen over all the king|dom.
&startq;But, for the common people,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;they are &s;till venom|ous;
and the magi&s;trates, in mo&s;t corporation towns round the nation,
no le&s;s malignant. They own their pre&s;ent burdens very heavy; yet
pro&s;e&s;&s;ed openly, that they would rather carry it on and on, than let
popery, by re&s;toring the King, &s;teal in upon them; and, when a&s;ked,
how they can read the King's la&s;t declaration, and ob&s;erve the promi&s;es
therein made, and yet doubt either of the e&s;tabli&s;hment or tranquillity
of their own church; they an&s;wer, that, being certain &s;ome of the&s;e
promi&s;es will be broke, they find rea&s;on to doubt whether any of them
will be kept; and they give for in&s;tance that clau&s;e, in which his Ma|je&s;ty
is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that, over and above what hath been promi&s;ed, if
his parliament, when it &s;its, can find out any expedient, for the better
&s;ettlement of the nation and &s;ecurity of their religion, he &s;hall a&s;&s;ent
to it.&endq;</P>
<P>After enumerating the &s;everal objections, which were made to James's
re&s;toration, on account of his religion, he gives &s;everal rea&s;ons to &s;how,
that neither the number nor the power of his friends was &s;o con&s;iderable,
as he was made to believe; and he in&s;tances what he him&s;elf had ob|&s;erved.
&startq;About two or three weeks,&endq; he &s;ays, &startq;after his Maje&s;ty's
declaration was publi&s;hed, being in the country northward, I found all
the King's true friends employed to know who, if occa&s;ion were, would
take up arms for him; and in all Lanca&s;hire and all York&s;hire, where
I then was, there could be found but very few prote&s;tants, that would
contribute to our King's re&s;toration, with any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance but that of
their good wi&s;hes. Nor could I find in other counties I pa&s;&s;ed through,
that there was any con&s;iderable endeavours made u&s;e of to learn either
what would or what could be done. So that, had his Maje&s;ty followed
his declaration, as was believed he would, and landed with a &s;mall army,
'tis to be feared, he would have found himfelf at a great lo&s;s, and upon
a dangerous pin.&endq;</P>
<P>He proceeds to give an account of a conver&s;ation he had, upon his
return to London, with &startq;a per&s;on of very great quality, and a prote&s;tant.
<PB N="490" REF="512">
I told him,&endq; he continues, &startq;our King was informed many thou&s;and of
his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects were in arms, and ready upon his landing to join
him. His reply was, that he did both believe and hope our King would
not tru&s;t to &s;uch &s;tories; that Roman Catholics were apprehended to cal|culate
wrong, as to the number of his Maje&s;ty's true friends; believing,
hands, when time &s;erves, will be as forward to fight for him, as tongues
are to wi&s;h him back.&endq;</P>
<P>This was confirmed to him, by &startq;another per&s;on of note, a lieutenant
colonel of hor&s;e, under our King at Sali&s;bury.&endq; This per&s;on &startq;was
very frequently with the chiefs, and mo&s;t part of tho&s;e prote&s;tants, who
had promi&s;ed to hazard both their lives and fortunes for the King, when
he was at La Hogue;&endq; and he found that nothing was ever determined
upon, at all their meetings, though he had often propo&s;ed to them, to
determine, &startq;whether, when the king landed, they &s;hould attempt to
break through the enemy and join him, or &s;tay till he had engaged
them on the one &s;ide, and then fall on the other. But he prote&s;ted to
me, that, though they met daily, nothing was agreed on, even to that
very day news were brought, that the French at &s;ea were defeat and
their &s;hips burnt.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I took,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;the confidence to a&s;k him (the man of quality)
yet further, if tho&s;e, who put him upon his la&s;t declaration and engaged
him in &s;uch large promi&s;es, did not a&s;&s;ure our King, that he &s;hould be
re&s;tored to his crown, without any hazard of his per&s;on? To which, an|&s;wer
was given, that our King is not the fir&s;t confiding and &s;incere
prince, that hath been wrong bia&s;&s;ed, by a de&s;igning people; who now,
by virtue of his declaration, being &s;ure, whenever he comes (for &s;o it
&s;peaks), both of their pardon and their privileges, provided only that
they fight not again&s;t him, who can rationally believe, that they will un|nece&s;&s;arily
hazard both their lives and fortunes, by fighting for him?&endq;
His opinion, therefore, was, that James &s;hould come over with a
powerful army; and, immediately, upon his landing, &startq;i&s;&s;ue a new me|nacing
declaration. For they mu&s;t be taught to live and fear, before
they will learn to do their duty.&endq;</P>
<P>He told his friend, that it was believed, that tho&s;e who framed the
declaration in England and &s;ent it over to St. Germains, had a&s;&s;ured the
<PB N="491" REF="513">
King, that they would free him from his promi&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t.</NOTE> by authority of par|liament.
His friend an&s;wered in the negative, and adduced &s;everal
rea&s;ons to convince him, that the Roman Catholics behaved imprudently,
and that there was no room to expect the hearty concurrence of the pro|te&s;tants,
in replacing James on the throne.</P>

<P>&startq;1. THE jealou&s;ies and fears the generality of your friends have, that
the King of France had no mind to re&s;tore your Maje&s;ty, having
had &s;everal opportunities, and made no u&s;e of them, the daily ruin of
their country, and the little hopes of relief, it is to be feared, that mo&s;t
of them will join with the pre&s;ent government, to prevent the total ruin of
their country; and tho&s;e, either in or out of the government, that have
given intelligence of the de&s;igns and out-going of the fleet, and the in|tercepting
of the merchant-men, will do &s;o no more.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The King's an&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, you are to a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e you come from, and all the
King's friends in general, that his Maje&s;ty is very &s;en&s;ible, both of their
actings and &s;ufferings for him, and hopes they will continue, when the
occa&s;ion de&s;erves it, to give him their advice and informations, whereby
to regulate his own proceedings here.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty has no rea&s;on to mi&s;tru&s;t the friend&s;hip and frequent pro|mi&s;es
of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King to re&s;tore him, whenever he is able;
and, &s;ince it is both his intere&s;t as well as for his honour to do it, it can|not
be thought that he will let &s;lip any opportunity, which he thinks a
good one to do it.</P>
<P>2. Whereas there was a bill brought in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament
of the oath of abjuration, they are in a more ea&s;y way to oblige the ge|nerality
to join in the war with them again&s;t France, which is an oath of
fidelity to the pre&s;ent government, without taking notice of your Maje&s;ty
<PB N="492" REF="514">
or the prince or prince&s;s of Orange's u&s;urped titles. It is not doubted,
but they will go a great length.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>It is to be &s;uppo&s;ed the prince of Orange will not con&s;ent to an oath,
that &s;eems to e&s;tabli&s;h a common-wealth; and it is to be hoped, that no|body
can be &s;urpri&s;ed with a new one, that &s;eemed to &s;cruple the old.</P>
<P>3. In the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, there was a bill brought in for
a general exci&s;e, but could not pa&s;s. It is not doubted but it will in
the next; that, with the general revenue of the crown, will amount, at
lea&s;t, to &s;ix million, and will certainly be paid to carry on the war again&s;t
France.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>The King expects, that his friends will u&s;e all their endeavours to op|po&s;e
a general exci&s;e; and, if it cannot be prevented, to make it as
onorous and clamorous, and for as &s;hort a time, as may be.</P>
<P>4. They are daily alarmed, with a general peace, and that your Ma|je&s;ty
is to be excluded; which does &s;tartle mo&s;t of your Maje&s;ty's loyal
&s;ubjects to that degree, that a great many of them are de&s;igning to
leave the kingdom, and &s;ome of the better &s;ort has already &s;ent to Ham|burgh
to know the con&s;titution of that place. If there be not &s;ome &s;peedy
cour&s;e taken to prevent this, it will be of ill con&s;equence to your
Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>That the King has no apprehen&s;ions of a general peace to his preju|dice;
and that he has rea&s;on to believe there is no treaty in agitation at
this time. So that the prince of Orange's brags are no more to be be|lieved,
upon this, than his promi&s;es upon other matters.</P>
<P>5. They de&s;ire, that your Maje&s;ty may commi&s;&s;ion &s;ome of the&s;e that
you think mo&s;t proper for the management of your affairs; and that they
may not be left to the indi&s;cretion of the generality of pretenders.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>That the King approves of their advice, and that he will give direc|tions
accordingly, with which they &s;hall be &s;peedily adverti&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="493" REF="515">
6. If your Maje&s;ty thinks fit, they de&s;ire to know whether you have
any confidence in any of the court-party. Some of them has been heard
&s;ay as much, though others dare not tru&s;t them, without your Maje&s;ty's
orders, with which they are ready to comply, and to join with them, or
any others for your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>That the King thinks it extreamly for his &s;ervice, that they &s;hould
endeavour to gain people to his intere&s;t, e&s;pecially, &s;uch as are employed
by the prince of Orange, as far as they can do it with their own &s;afety;
and they can be&s;t judge whom they can treat with in &s;uch nice matters.</P>
<P>7. They de&s;ire, that your Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions may be more early
&s;ent this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament than they were the la&s;t.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>That be&s;ides what is herein contained, and what has been formerly &s;aid
upon that occa&s;ion, the King does not fee, that there is any more direc|tions
to be given: but in ca&s;e they, upon the place, have any thing to
offer, they &s;hall know the King's mind immediately thereupon; and than,
upon the whole, he remits this and all other things to their prudent ma|nagement.</P>
<P>8. They earne&s;tly beg, that your Maje&s;ty may think on &s;ome way how
to reconcile the church party and the&s;e of the di&s;&s;enters, that are in par|liament.
It would contribute much to your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>If they cannot prevail to reconcile the&s;e parties in parliament as to
their own divi&s;ions, the King recommends, both to them and you, that
endeavours may be u&s;ed to reconcile them to him and to the cau&s;e in
general.</P>
<P>9. They beg, that your Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to admit of the
chancellor of England into your councils. Your enemies take advan|tage
of his not being in it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>The King will be, on all occa&s;ions, ready to expre&s;s the ju&s;t value
and e&s;teem he has for his lord chancellor.</P>
<P>10. They beg, that your Maje&s;ty may return me, or whom your Ma|je&s;ty
thinks more fit, with in&s;tructions what your Maje&s;ty will have
<PB N="494" REF="516">
them do; for, at pre&s;ent, they are at a &s;tand, and do not know what
to do.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>This article is an&s;wered already by the former.</P>
<P>11. They de&s;ire, that your Maje&s;ty may adhere to your la&s;t declaration.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer,</HEAD>
<P>The King has never given any rea&s;on to believe that he will infringe
his declaration, and he is re&s;olved not to do it.</P>
<P>12. They de&s;ire, that, if your Maje&s;ty thinks fit to call any of the
bi&s;hops, that it may be the bi&s;hop of Ely. They think it would be for
your &s;ervice, and he is in a condition to live without being burthen&s;ome
to your Maje&s;ty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>The King approves of their opinion, and when he calls any it &s;hall
be him.</P>
<P>13. They de&s;ire, that your Maje&s;ty would acquaint the King of France
with the condition of colonel Parker and Cro&s;bey. They are afraid it
will go hard with them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>The King of France has been informed of Parker and Cro&s;bey's con|dition;
but his appearing for them would do them prejudice.</P>
<P>14. They de&s;ire, that what orders or in&s;tructions they are to receive
may be from your Maje&s;ty, or from your &s;ecretaries only, and not from
particular per&s;ons, who pretend to have private in&s;tructions from your
Maje&s;ty; and what they &s;end &s;hall be directly to your&s;elf and to your
&s;ecretaries.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>That the King approves of their advice, and has given particular di|rections
about it, according to their opinion, and that you are not for the
future to give any credit to any per&s;on, who &s;hall pre&s;ume to act to the
contrary.&endq;</P>
<P>There were two parties in James's cabinet, the compounders and the
non-compounders. Middleton was at the head of the fir&s;t, and Melfort
of the la&s;t. The compounders advi&s;ed him to offer a general pardon, in
<PB N="495" REF="517">
his declarations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> and propo&s;ed to bring him back only upon certain
conditions: the non-compounders were willing to receive him, without
any re&s;trictions, and to except &s;everal per&s;ons in his offers of pardon.
The&s;e probably were James's favourites. But, to plea&s;e the other party,
Mel&s;ort was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, as if under &s;ome di&s;grace, and ordered to with|draw
from court; and Mr. Caryll was made &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in his

of his re&s;pect for the King, our ma&s;ter, and his earne&s;t wi&s;hes of what
was propo&s;ed, &s;tarted &s;everal difficultys of a year old, as want of money,
the difficulty of the tran&s;portation, the want of a place of &s;ecurity, and the
danger of their being beaten. To which I returned not only the old
an&s;wers, but &s;uch new ones as the pre&s;ent conjuncture afforded, which
will not be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat, &s;ince I have always acquainted the King,
our ma&s;ter, with what I thought might be &s;aid on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. He
told me he would repre&s;ent what I &s;aid to the King. I could perceive,
that what he objected was not &s;o much from him&s;elf, as what he &s;uppo&s;ed
might be by others, which are indeed &s;o very weak, that I cannot but
entertain good hopes, notwith&s;tanding Mon&s;ieur de Pontchartrain's dry
an&s;wer. For it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they will undertake any thing,
till they have &s;een the di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy's forces both by land and
<PB N="498" REF="520">
&s;ea; and, when they do, they perhaps will keep the &s;ecret from us as
long as they can; nor ought we to wonder at it, after the alarm that
was given la&s;t &s;pring. I can find by the courtiers, that Mon&s;ieur de
Pontchartrain is the only man, at this time, that has any intere&s;t with his
matter. For my own part, I &s;hould be very glad to be confined to
Con&s;tantinople, on condition the lord Melfort could carry our ma&s;ter
home. But it is very probable, that Mon&s;ieur de Phillippeaux does not
differ in opinion with his father. This court goes into mourning to|morrow;
&s;o that I mu&s;t keep my chamber till I can get mine from
Paris. Let your landlord know, that there is here no <HI>noctes Atticae</HI> nor

<P>&startq;THE King and his mini&s;ters have approved of your memorial.
Mon&s;ieur de Pontchartrain did not choo&s;e to enter into parti|culars,
and referred me to Mon&s;ieur de Croi&s;&s;y. Mon&s;ieur de Croi&s;&s;y
&s;tarted the &s;ame difficulties he &s;tarted la&s;t year. I am not, therefore,
able to &s;ee clearly through this affair. I &s;ent compliments to Mon&s;ieur
de la Touche, who an&s;wered me immediately, that he would come to &s;ee
me the next morning. But he &s;ent then an excu&s;e, without fixing any
other time; and, as there are five days &s;ince, I have no hopes of &s;eeing
him, and I don't believe that I ought to pre&s;s him farther, as there may be
&s;ome my&s;tery in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;It is from your care and prudence, that I expect the &s;ucce&s;s of our
affairs.&endq;</P>
<P>He writes to him in the &s;ame de&s;ponding &s;train, on the &s;ixth of
October. &startq;I have received,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;your letter of the fourth, and,
thank God, I am naturally inclined to follow the cour&s;e you approve of,
<PB N="499" REF="521">
which is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">December.</NOTE> not to importune any one. Our affair is always in the &s;ame
&s;ituation. It is no longer &s;poken of; and I imagine, they want to &s;ee the
di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy's forces by &s;ea and land, before they come to
any re&s;olution. It is &s;o apparent, that Mon&s;ieur de la Touche pur|po&s;ely
avoids me, that I think, I &s;hould not pre&s;s him any more. I
will not de&s;pair, while we allow our&s;elves to be guided by you.&endq;</P>

<P>IN the fir&s;t place, you mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure all our friends, that have been
concerned with you in our &s;ervice, that we have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their

in our behalf, of which we &s;hall be very mindful, whenever it
&s;hall plea&s;e God to put us in a condition of &s;hewing our good intentions

<P>Secondly, you are to de&s;ire them, in our name, to keep them&s;elves
in a readine&s;s to &s;erve us, whenever a good occa&s;ion offers it&s;elf; and
that, in the mean time, they &s;hould be cautious to pre&s;erve them&s;elves,

from us; which they &s;hall not fail of, in the proper &s;ea&s;on, when they
may do us effectual &s;ervice, without needle&s;sly expo&s;ing them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they mu&s;t not expect, that we can name the time when this
will be, &s;ince it depends upon &s;o many future contingents and not upon
our will; but that of our deare&s;t brother, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, who,
however well inclined he may be towards us, whereof we have all the
rea&s;on in the world to be thoroughly &s;atisfied, mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding,
wait for the means and opportunities of executing what we all de&s;ire.
Wherefore, our friends mu&s;t con&s;ider, that, although they &s;uffer very
much by delay, yet none can be greater &s;ufferers thereby, than we our|&s;elves.
So that they may re&s;t &s;atisfied, we &s;hall neglect no opportunity
of bringing to pa&s;s, what is our common concern.</P>

<P>Mr. Piggot having informed, with &s;ome a&s;&s;urance, Mr. Harri&s;on,

[K. James] de&s;ires to be further informed from Ty&s;on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It having been repre&s;ented from many hands, and particularly by

intelligence, and to tran&s;late the memorials he pre&s;ented to Lewis XIV.

<P>IF I have not the honour of writing to you as often as I would wi&s;h,
it is not for want of attention, or of zeal for the &s;ervice of our com|mon
ma&s;ters, which I con&s;ider to be in&s;eparable. I doubt not but dif|ferent
rumours, which &s;pread from Holland and from France, may have
cau&s;ed great unea&s;ine&s;s among your friends; and &s;uch of them as are
here may te&s;tify to you, how &s;orry I was for this. Yet I did not think,
as things were circum&s;tanced, that I &s;hould write much, on account of
the danger; and it was al&s;o proper not to write any thing precipitately,
while you might have imagined, that, if I wrote you that affairs were
not as far advanced as was publi&s;hed, I had been ill-informed. But
whatever may be &s;aid to you, you may be thoroughly per&s;uaded that no
&s;tep was taken on this &s;ide, but as much, at lea&s;t, was done on the other;
and that, if they have alledged, that Mr. Ben&s;on [the K. of France]
was willing to fini&s;h with his creditors [enemies], without troubling
him&s;elf about Mr. Arflie [K. James], they have advanced a very great
fal&s;ehood. It was very true, that an attempt was made to &s;ettle; but
<PB N="502" REF="524">
the factors had not the nece&s;&s;ary orders, and would not &s;ettle, though
they were much pre&s;&s;ed to it. At any rate, we propo&s;e nothing now,
but to carry on the law-&s;uit. It is true, Mr Ben&s;on's [Fr. King] friends
are embara&s;&s;ed to &s;ee, that the cour&s;e of affairs on your &s;ide incline one
to believe, that Mr. Artlie [K. James] hath no friends. Perhaps, if
they had not been in &s;uch a hurry to grant every thing to Sawly [K.
William], we would have been more expeditious on our &s;ide; and all
that can be &s;aid to a&s;&s;ure them, that Mr. Artlie [K. James] has friends
&s;till, does not &s;atisfy them. For they &s;ay, on the contrary, that they
clearly perceive, by what pa&s;&s;es, that his friends have not much influ|ence
or good intentions. However, we have both here; and, perhaps,
convincing proofs of this may be given &s;oon; at lea&s;t, I am made to
hope &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. Toncroft [L. Middleton], in whom they place here all confi|dence,
and for whom they have all the re&s;pect and e&s;teem imaginable,
will advi&s;e you of every thing. For nothing is concealed from him of
what I know. I expect, before a fortnight, to be able to write to you
more about the&s;e things. I intreat you, Sir, in the mean time, to be
per&s;uaded that I &s;hall not fail in any thing that can contribute to the

and the friends of James began to entertain expectations of

in Mr. Nairne's papers, is contained in a letter from J. Ander&s;on to
Mr. Applebey, <HI>i. e.</HI> from the earl of Middleton to a corre&s;pondent in

<P>I Mo&s;t thankfully acknowledge the favour of yours of the 6th and 13th

an indi&s;po&s;ition cau&s;ed by a great cold, of which I am not yet quite
recovered. However, I could no longer di&s;pen&s;e with my writing to
you, in pur&s;uance of the directions I have received from our con&s;ul,
on the occa&s;ion of a &s;trong report we have here, that the owner of the
goods No. 535 [prince&s;s of Orange] being dead. If it &s;hould prove
fal&s;e, you are earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ay nothing of it to any body. But
if it &s;hould prove true, then you will be convinced, that there will be
enough to &s;et all hands to work. We cannot pretend here to enter into
the particulars of the acts, which must be done by the factors on the
place. But there is one point which &s;eems to be of great importance;
which is, whether the merchant who owns the goods No. 551 [the par|liament
of England] is broken; there are many good rea&s;ons to believe
it, con&s;idering the great dependance he had on the other. This would
be the greate&s;t advantage that could happen to the company; becau&s;e it
was he who &s;upported all the interlopers; and, before a new joint &s;tock
could be made up, the market would be &s;lopt.</P>
<P><PB N="505" REF="529">
Pray pre&s;ent my &s;ervice to your Hamburgh partner, and tell him,

accepted bills will be very quickly paid, and that, if he will make a
con&s;iderable venture now, the return will make him the leading man
upon the change.&endq;</P>
<P>The Hamburgh merchant, mentioned &s;o often in Middleton's letters to
Appleby, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the earl of Marlborough. The earl of
Middleton wrote another letter of this date, with more particular di|rections

<P>I Received yours of the 10th of December,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers, vol. vii. 4to.</NOTE> which I could not an&s;wer
by the la&s;t po&s;t, becau&s;e I was ill. You may ea&s;ily imagine, that to
be well thought of, by one &s;o generally and de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed, was
no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to me. But no more of this for the future. The
King has commanded me to write to you, that there is here a &s;trong
report that the prince&s;s of Orange is dead. If it is fal&s;e, he de&s;ires you
would take no notice of this to any body; nor did he think fit to
wait for the confirmation of it, becau&s;e his friends might rea&s;onably be
impatient to hear from him on &s;uch an extraordinary occa&s;ion. Be|&s;ides
that, our po&s;t has been very &s;low and uncertain of late. But he
is the le&s;s unea&s;y, becau&s;e he knows his bu&s;ine&s;s cannot &s;uffer thereby,
in your hands, &s;ince you want no body to prompt or direct you, in
the management of it; and that you do every thing to embroil and
oppo&s;e the u&s;urper's affairs, as occa&s;ion offers.</P>
<P>If this report is true, the chief thing to be aimed at is the di&s;&s;o|lution
of this parliament, for which many &s;trong rea&s;ons may be urged;
and though I am of opinion, that they will vote them&s;elves &s;till a par|liament,
yet the contrary ought to be &s;howed in print, for which proper
per&s;ons ought to be employed. It will &s;erve to baffle their acts; people
will be more unwilling to pay taxes, or advance any thing on their
&s;ecurity; and, if a &s;ucceeding parliament &s;hould declare this to have been
null, from &s;uch a time, what penalties the&s;e members may incur, or
what actions may be brought again&s;t them, or tho&s;e who act by their
<PB N="506" REF="530">
authority, ought to be &s;howed, in ca&s;e &s;till that this report is true. I do
not doubt but you will communicate this to Mr. Donton and other
friends; for I have neither time nor health to do it my&s;elf, which would
be but a repetition of the &s;ame thing. If there is any thing in this that
you cannot read, Thomas Adams will do it for you.&endq;</P>
<P>Middleton received certain intelligence of the Queen's death on the
fifteenth of January.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers, vol. vii. 4to.</NOTE> He communicated the news immediately, by letter,
to the marquis de Torcy; in which, he adds, &startq;The King, my ma&s;ter,
does not con&s;ider her as his daughter, becau&s;e &s;he had renounced her
being &s;o in &s;uch an open manner. There is even rea&s;on to fear that &s;he
died in her impenitence.&endq;</P>

<P>IF my bad &s;tate of health had not hindered me from applying to

pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es to him. Can any one imagine, that, when there is a
man who is acknowledged as King, and his Queen dies, who had an
equal &s;hare of the &s;overeignty with him, a parliament then a&s;&s;embled
can avoid to make compliments to him upon the occa&s;ion. With re|gard
to the &s;tile, it is mere form; and, with regard to the compliment
at the end, I infer a very favourable conclu&s;ion from it. They promi&s;e
&startq;to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t all his enemies, both dome&s;tic and foreign.' They
might &s;ay &s;o, if there had been a civil war. But while all is quiet and
obedient, I maintain it is without example.</P>
<P>Here then is an authentic acknowledgment of the two hou&s;es of par|liament,
that there is a party in oppo&s;ition to the government; and that
it mu&s;t be very formidable, &s;ince they think it nece&s;&s;ary to offer him
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t it. This appears to me to be a &s;tronger proof
of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a party, than any thing we could have &s;aid; and
this remark being made by you, will have more weight, and will not be
&s;u&s;pected. For I apprehend &s;ometimes, that they &s;u&s;pect that we want
to impo&s;e upon them, which has been always very far from my intention.
But, perhaps, we are obliged for this to lord Melfort.</P>
<P>I &s;end you al&s;o the London Gazette, where you will find the&s;e ad|dre&s;&s;es
more exact than any where el&s;e. I intreat you to be &s;o good as

<HEAD>&startq;A memorial concerning the &s;tate of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 25.</NOTE> 19 January, 1695.&endq;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">&startq;An examination of the P. of O&mdash;'s right to the crown at Queen Mary's
death.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>ALL the people of England mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, at this time, con|vinced,
that the title of the prince of Orange to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the crown is not only unju&s;t, in reference to the King and to the prince
of Wales, but al&s;o to the prince&s;s of Denmark, according to their own
new law, though his Maje&s;ty was, as they pretend, excluded by abdi|cation;
for none of our new law-makers ever pretended, or dur&s;t &s;ay,
that the crown of England is elective. Wherefore, though by demi&s;e
or abdication, or for failure (let them call it what they plea&s;e) they pre|tend
the pre&s;ent occupant may be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, yet &s;till it is an unde|niable
maxim among&s;t them all, that, in &s;uch ca&s;es, it ought to de&s;cend
to the next in blood, again&s;t whom no &s;uch incapacity lies.</P>
<P>Nor let it be &s;aid, that the modern act of &s;ettlement creates a &s;ufficient
and ju&s;t title to the prince of Orange, for his pre&s;ent holding the
crown: for it is the opinion of my lord Coke and all the able&s;t lawyers,
that an act of parliament, vi&s;ibly contrary, either to the divine law or
common ju&s;tice, is void in it&s;elf: and nothing can be more apparently
contrary to ju&s;tice, according to their own maxims, than to prefer, in
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, the prince of Orange, a foreigner, and re|moter
by one degree, to the prince&s;s of Denmark, a native and your
immediate heir. It is certain, that tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who concurred
to the making of this law, did it upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that the prince of
Orange could not out-live his wife; he appearing, at that time, far
gone in an a&s;thma, and &s;he of a vigorous and healthy con&s;titution;
which made them be&s;tow, in the heat of their kindne&s;s, that compli|ment
upon him, not to unking him upon the death of his wife, which
then they thought would prove but a bare compliment, though now it
falls out otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="509" REF="533">
Of this neither the prince of Orange nor the Engli&s;h nation in ge|neral
are ignorant. We are, therefore, to con&s;ider what effects may
thence naturally follow, and how each of them will be moved to act,
according to their &s;everal principles and intere&s;ts: for now, more than
ever, he and the nation are perfectly two.</P>
<P>To make a judgment of what effects it may have upon the Engli&s;h
nation, we mu&s;t con&s;ider &s;everally the two great parties into which it is
divided, viz. the church of England-men monarchical, and the di&s;|&s;enters
republican, by thir principles. As to tho&s;e of the church of Eng|land,
it is evident, that, by the death of the prince&s;s of Orange, and
the reigning alone of her hu&s;band, they not only lo&s;e all hopes of con|tinuing
uppermo&s;t, as by the laws in force they ought to be, but are
in danger of their very being. For they well know, that this prince was
bred a pre&s;byterian; and, that &s;ince his u&s;urpation, he has &s;ufficiently
demon&s;trated what his inclinations are, by aboli&s;hing epi&s;copacy in Scot|land,
and even in England, by his putting in of late, to all offices and
places of tru&s;t [bi&s;hopricks not excepted], Pre&s;byterians, or Latitudi|narians.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the prince&s;s lived, the church of England were at &s;ome ea&s;e
and thought them&s;elves &s;afe, by the countenance and encouragement
they received from her, who was educated by them; and al&s;o, by the
great hopes they had of her &s;urviving her hu&s;band. But he now reign|ing
alone, in his own right, it may ea&s;ily be imagined what their &s;enti|ments
and apprehen&s;ions are; and how they are di&s;po&s;ed to free them&s;elves
from a dominion, &s;o unfound at the bottom in title, and &s;o little favour|able
to them.</P>
<P>It ought particularly to be remarked, that in all the times of monar|chy,
the church of England-party has ever prevailed, in the hou&s;e of
commons, notwith&s;tanding all the efforts, which have not been &s;mall, of
the di&s;&s;enters to the contrary; and that hou&s;e being the bulky and
weighty part of the nation, and having the pur&s;e, all Engli&s;hmen in
general naturally lean to their &s;ide; &s;o that the epi&s;copal-party, &s;upported
by the hou&s;e of commons, will certainly &s;tand their ground, and prove
a dangerous enemy to the prince of Orange, who can only &s;ecure him|&s;elf,
by making u&s;e of his foreigners to bring both them and their &s;up|porters
under &s;ubjection.</P>
<P><PB N="510" REF="534">
As to the di&s;&s;enters, their propen&s;ion to the prince of Orange, is not
Out of any love to him, but only cau&s;ed by their oppo&s;ition to the church
of England, and by their aver&s;ion to monarchy in general. For they
think it an ea&s;ier &s;tep, from a wrong King to no King, than from a right
King; and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, they will better endure the reign of
a woman, than of a man, which will not a little make for the prince&s;s of
Denmark, if ever &s;he come to a conte&s;t with the prince of Orange: for
the&s;e di&s;&s;enters being of a true republican &s;pirit, can naturally bear no
&s;uperiority, either in church or &s;tate; and, next to having no rulers
over them, the weake&s;t will always be mo&s;t acceptable to them. But
the&s;e men mu&s;t be con&s;idered, not under the notion of di&s;&s;enters, but
al&s;o as Engli&s;hmen; and, upon that national account, they will as vio|lently
oppo&s;e the domination of &s;trangers, as any other Engli&s;h &s;ubjects
what&s;oever. So that, if the prince of Orange &s;hall think him&s;elf obliged,
for his own &s;ecurity, to awe the nation by foreign troops, all that is
Engli&s;h, even army and navy, will certainly join, as one man, to keep
them out.</P>
<P>To this mu&s;t be added the haughty and moro&s;e humour of that prince,
which could not fail to extingui&s;h all affection for his per&s;on. It is true,
the contrary behaviour of the prince&s;s of Orange and her popular affa|bility
did, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, appea&s;e, or, at lea&s;t, cover the general di&s;gu&s;t
conceived again&s;t him. But &s;he being dead, nothing can hinder an in|crea&s;e
of aver&s;ion between him and the people; and both mu&s;t proceed
in their own natural ways, he to di&s;oblige and they to re&s;ent.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to judge what the con&s;equences may be of this pre&s;ent &s;tate of
affairs and di&s;po&s;ition of minds in England. The prince of Orange
can no otherwi&s;e &s;upport the weakne&s;s of his title, again&s;t the manife&s;t
right of his Maje&s;ty, according to the old true law, or again&s;t that of the
prince&s;s of Denmark, according to their new model, and &s;ecure to him&s;elf
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, but by tran&s;porting into England an army
of foreigners &s;ufficient to overawe the nation. But this is what no
Engli&s;h parliament, though never &s;o much pen&s;ionary, no Engli&s;h army,
no Engli&s;h fleet will ever endure; and yet it is not more than probable,
con&s;idering the circum&s;tanccs of his affairs and his own natural jealou&s;y,
that he will attempt to do it, not all of a &s;udden, but by degrees. But
then, by the &s;ame degrees will al&s;o increa&s;e the jealou&s;y of the Engli&s;h,
<PB N="511" REF="535">
till, at la&s;t, it mu&s;t break out into open ho&s;tility. This opportunity
&s;hould not be lo&s;t by his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, of humbling an enemy,
who has rai&s;ed and leads all the forces in Europe again&s;t France; and of
reducing him to an impo&s;&s;ibility of doing any more hurt, no more than
by the King of England, for the recovery of his crown. That the oc|ca&s;ion
may not be lo&s;t to both, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, that a competent
number of troops and &s;hips may always be in a readine&s;s, upon the fir&s;t
commotions in England, to &s;upport the contrary party to the prince of
Orange; otherwi&s;e, &s;hould he prevail in that &s;truggle, and reduce Eng|land
as he has done Holland, under a perfect &s;ubjection, he would be|come
a more dangerous enemy than ever. It is not to be expected, that,
upon the fir&s;t ri&s;ings, any declaration will be made in behalf of his Ma|je&s;ty,
but their preten&s;ions will be to a&s;&s;ert the indi&s;putable right (com|paratively
to his) of a prince&s;s born in England, again&s;t an intruding
foreigner, or rather upon a national account, to pre&s;erve England from
being overrun with &s;trangers. A ready &s;ea&s;onable &s;upport from France,
upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, will not only have the effect of turning the ba|lance
again&s;t the prince of Orange, but will al&s;o determine the oppo&s;ite
party to him, to declare for their lawful King; who&s;e re&s;toration is, per|haps,
the only means of any la&s;ting peace, that, can be had with honour
and advantage.</P>
<P>There is no likelihood that Marlborough could have been forgotten,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE>
during the intrigues which followed the death of Queen Mary. Middleton,
in a letter to his corre&s;pondent Appleby, on the 30th of January, 1695,
mentions an application which was then made to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, vol. vii. 4to.</NOTE> &startq;I &s;uppo&s;e you

immediately to whom they are payable; for an hone&s;t and wi&s;e man
never places his favours, but where he has an entire confidence; and you
may a&s;&s;ure your Hamburgh partner of both.&endq;</P>
<P>The old country gentlewoman, was Mr. Radcliffe, who went with

<P>&startq;THIS is only to acknowledge the favour of yours, of the 16th of

<P>About this time, Middleton corre&s;ponded with No. 18 [colonel Gra|ham],
who was a &s;py, employed by King William. Middleton was a
man of &s;ome humour and learning; and he &s;ometimes threw a mixture of
both into his letters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> on the mo&s;t &s;erious &s;ubjects. It appears from his
an&s;wers, that Graham, who wanted to make him&s;elf of con&s;equence to his
employers, complained bitterly, that he received too little intelligence;
and Middleton, who perhaps &s;u&s;pected him, prote&s;ted that he wrote with
&s;incerity and plainne&s;s, though he indulged a little innocent raillery,
when he had nothing material to communicate.</P>
<P>The letter &s;ent from England<NOTE PLACE="marg">March</NOTE>, in Augu&s;t, 1694, gave, probably, a
true account of the &s;tate of things in that country; but it was natural
enough for King James to &s;ee them in a different light, when the fa|vourites
and mini&s;ters of King William, betrayed their ma&s;ter's councils,

<P>I Have received the letter, which your Maje&s;ty did me the honour to
write to me, on the 24th of February, with the po&s;t&s;cript of the 4th
of March, preci&s;ely as the courrier was &s;etting out; &s;o that it was im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="513" REF="537">
for me to an&s;wer it, by the la&s;t opportunity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> and I had &s;ome
hopes, to be able to &s;end you, by the pre&s;ent, a letter from lord Sunder|land;
having brought about an interview between him and bi&s;hop Lay|burn.
My lord has confirmed to the bi&s;hop all I wrote to you in his
name, in my former letters, with which I am very well plea&s;ed. He
has been &s;o much occupied all this week, that he could not write, at this
time; but you may depend, that you will have a letter from him, by the
fir&s;t packet; and, at the &s;ame time, you may be a&s;&s;ured, that I &s;hall
neglect nothing which depends upon me, in &s;erving your Maje&s;ty.
They are the &s;low mea&s;ures, which are taking on your &s;ide, that ruin
every thing, and render your friends timid and di&s;tru&s;tful; who, otherwi&s;e,
would be willing to act and to hazard all, if they &s;aw, on the &s;ide of
France, a greater di&s;po&s;ition to undertake any thing again&s;t England.
It is not the&s;e extraordinary precautions and long delays, that will ever
do the bu&s;ine&s;s. I am a&s;&s;ured, that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty can never
employ his forces more advantageou&s;ly, both for him&s;elf and for your
Maje&s;ty, than by making an effort on this &s;ide, which is not &s;o imprac|ticable
as they imagine, either with regard to the number of troops or man|ner
of tran&s;porting them. It is true, the greater the number of the
troops, the more certain will be the &s;ucce&s;s. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to
have more, than can be ea&s;ily tran&s;ported: for 20 or 25,000 men will be
&s;ufficient. That number will contribute more, at pre&s;ent, in England, to
fini&s;h the war, than 100,000 men employed in any place whatever. But
if other mea&s;ures are taken, there is no remedy. I am per&s;uaded they
will repent of them. It is impo&s;&s;ible to add any thing to what hath been
&s;o often repeated upon this &s;ubject. It is not even nece&s;&s;ary to urge
your Maje&s;ty to a thing, that is &s;o much your intere&s;t. Since I came
from Scotland, I have always be&s;eeched your Maje&s;ty to let me know,
what your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervants and friends, in this country, &s;hould do, on
their part, in order to induce his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, to engage in this
enterprize: for without that, there is nothing to be done. It appears
to us, that it is his intere&s;t as much as your Maje&s;ty's; but of this, he
him&s;elf is the be&s;t judge.</P>
<P>I know, that your Maje&s;ty receives exact accounts of all that pa&s;&s;es in
parliament; therefore, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing on the &s;ubject. There are
great heats and conte&s;ts among the&s;e gentlemen; but that will not hinder
<PB N="514" REF="538">
the affair of the &s;ub&s;idy. The lower hou&s;e are to choo&s;e another &s;peaker
to-morrow.</P>
<P>With regard to news, it is certain, that the preparations that are made
here for the Mediterranean, are de&s;igned for attacking Toulon, if it is
po&s;&s;ible. It is lord Sunderland who has given me in charge to a&s;&s;ure
your Maje&s;ty of this; but he told me, at the &s;ame time, that he does
not believe the enterprize will take place, becau&s;e he is per&s;uaded, that
it will not be found practicable, when they come to put it in execution.
At any rate, they are re&s;olved, at pre&s;ent, to try to execute it.</P>
<P>I conclude, with intreating your Maje&s;ty, to permit me here, to
a&s;&s;ure the Queen of my very humble re&s;pects, and to declare my&s;elf to

and it is a common artifice of people's enemies, to make them jealous
of their friends. Unfore&s;een accidents may defer the be&s;t re&s;olutions;
but rea&s;on and intere&s;t will prevail, when it is practicable and tho&s;e we

Maje&s;ty's re&s;toration, than they were at fir&s;t, in advancing the revolu|tion.
Be&s;ides, the management of the church affairs, in Scotland, has
created in them a rea&s;onable jealou&s;y of their fate at home. The &s;econd
cla&s;s is that of the fanaticks, who the prince of Orange has broke his
word with, in every article; it being his promi&s;e, that he would not
a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf even the pretence of being King, the very name of
which, as well as a monarchical government, they hate to an antipathy.
But when their principles are rightly weighed, and a calculation made of
the &s;lightne&s;s of their power, they are apparently too contemptible to be
&s;olicited for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, upon any account; for they are a &s;ort of
people, who&s;e practices have ever demon&s;trated, that they have no notion
of honour; though this may be &s;aid of them, that as they are too &s;elfi&s;h to
do good to the cau&s;e, &s;o it may be very rea&s;onably inferred, they will
scarce run the hazard of making an oppo&s;ition. So that, if your Ma|je&s;ty
is &s;ecure of meeting with the friend&s;hip of the fir&s;t, and that the
other will give no ob&s;truction, the encouragement for your Maje&s;ty to
take this opportunity will &s;till be greater, when the bulk of the nation
(taking it under the title of the popularity) are declared enemys to the
pre&s;ent con&s;titution; and, as &s;lender taxes have ever been attended in
England, with the di&s;contents of the people, &s;o it is not to be won|dered
at, when the &s;ub&s;idies are &s;o prodigious, that groans and outcrys
are &s;pread throughout the kingdom, and to that degree, that it is rare
to hear any body &s;peak of the government without a cur&s;e, and at the
&s;ame time, begging for a &s;peedy deliverance.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides all this, your Maje&s;ty is &s;en&s;ible of the &s;incere affections and
entire zeal of a great number of your &s;ubjects, who&s;e loyalty, in this un|happy
interval, has never &s;uffered the lea&s;t taint, and their readine&s;s to
obey any of your Maje&s;ty's commands has never failed of appearing, and
who&s;e whole bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to be perpetually employing them&s;elves in
engaging others, which has already been effected with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that,
by a mode&s;t computation, the better part of the army in England is &s;ure
to &s;erve your Maje&s;ty, whenever they are called on, particularly the
battalions of foot guards and the royal regiment of hor&s;e; and, as there
is no room for doubting of the fidelity of the&s;e friends of your Maje&s;ty's,
&s;o their credit, when they make promi&s;es to your Maje&s;ty, can never fail
of weight.</P>
<P><PB N="517" REF="541">
The&s;e were the preliminaries, that were thought expedient for me to
lay before your Maje&s;ty. Fir&s;t, then, I was to acquaint you with a re&s;o|lution,
that they had come to, and which they concluded a con&s;iderable
inducement for your Maje&s;ty to make an attempt with a &s;mall force,
which they e&s;teem 10,000 men to be, $000 of which to be hor&s;e, 1000
with equipage intended for dragoons, and 8000 foot. This is a number
which is thought the King of Fran$$ can &s;pare at any time, e&s;pecially
when the &s;ucce&s;s is &s;o morally certain, and, by that means, your Maje&s;ty
re&s;tored, and his whole difficulty with the allies fini&s;hed at once.</P>
<P>What they a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty of performing on their parts is (if this
number can be complied with, and they adverti&s;ed of the month that
your Maje&s;ty intends a de&s;cent), they will have 2000 hor&s;e ready, with
men and all accoutrements fit for &s;ervice, either to march directly to the
place where you re&s;olve to land at, or el&s;e to march any other way that
your Maje&s;ty &s;hall order, to give a diver&s;ion and an amu&s;ement to the
troops of the government that may be upon motion. If your Maje&s;ty
makes u&s;e of them to attend your landing, they will, at the &s;ame time,
engage the mounting the thou&s;and men with hor&s;es, which are de&s;igned
for dragoons; and, though they have fixt only upon this number of
2000, yet I am to let your Maje&s;ty know they verily believe they &s;hall
make them 4000, and it may be 10,000.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al is made to make things as ea&s;y to the King of France
as po&s;&s;ible, it being their opinion the hor&s;es cannot be conveniently
&s;pared. Be&s;ides that, a great number of hor&s;e would take up &s;o many
&s;hips, that in the time they were getting ready, the alarm would be taken,
and of con&s;equence an ob&s;truction given; whereas, for the number de|&s;ired,
thirty tran&s;port &s;hips, with eight or ten frigates from Dunkirk, are
&s;ufficient, and there will be no nece&s;&s;ity of being embarra&s;&s;ed with more
than four or five days provi&s;ions aboard, the coa&s;t of England being &s;o
near, and there being no po&s;&s;ibility of wanting wherever you land. If
the confederate fleet be an objection to this, &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;quadron of
them to lie before Dunkirk, it is believed, that, if the King of France
will give a fal&s;e alarm at Bre&s;t, &s;ome time before he thinks of putting
this propo&s;al in execution, by embarking 5 or 6000 there, as it may be
naturally &s;uppo&s;ed that the prince of Orange and the government of
England will receive a quick adverti&s;ement of it, &s;o it will take off any
<PB N="518" REF="542">
&s;u&s;picion of what is to be done at Dunkirk, and will of cour&s;e divert the
whole fleet to ob&s;erve what they will expect from Bre&s;t. But, becau&s;e a
projection of this nature may po&s;&s;ibly be thought more fea&s;ible when
the campaign is over, it is nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;ent to your Maje&s;ty the
apprehen&s;ions we are under, that the prince of Orange will return with
an army of foreigners: for he is &s;en&s;ible how many men of quality he
has di&s;gu&s;ted, by leaving them out of this new commi&s;&s;ion, and by put|ting
into that power and tru&s;t per&s;ons of le&s;s quality and intere&s;t than
them&s;elves: &s;o that he has rea&s;on to apprehend, that &s;uch u&s;age will be
attended with re&s;entments; and be&s;ides, by &s;ome violent proceedings in
the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions of that parliament, he was with difficulty brought to &s;uf|fer
them to fit any longer; but the pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances of &s;ome at the helm,
and the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity he was under for money, be&s;ides the reflections
that the allies would have made upon his parting with his parliament in
a heat, forced him to lay a&s;ide the thoughts of di&s;&s;olving them then.
But, that he will call a new one upon his return, is what every body ex|pects
and depends upon; and as it has always been an ob&s;ervation in
England, that the di&s;&s;olution of one parliament never produced a better,
&s;o the prince of Orange has only recour&s;e to an army to intimidate them
into a compliance, &s;ince his mea&s;ures of bribery are like to fall to the
ground; and if this &s;hould arrive, your Maje&s;ty will con&s;ider, that then
you mu&s;t come with an army, at lea&s;t equivalent to what he will have
in England.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t likewi&s;e lay before your Maje&s;ty an opinion, which is generally
received even by the great men in the government, which they have de|clared
upon occa&s;ional di&s;cour&s;e (&s;uppo&s;ing the King of France could
a&s;&s;i&s;t your Maje&s;ty before the prince of Orange returns from Flanders);
which is this, that if your Maje&s;ty were once landed, whoever &s;hould
oppo&s;e you would be rebels; for that all the world knows your Maje&s;ty
is King <HI>de jure,</HI> and when landed you are King <HI>de facto</HI> too: &s;o that
then the prince of Orange is dive&s;ted of all preten&s;ions, even by his
friends. But if your Maje&s;ty cannot have this opportunity afforded you,
but to have it deferred till winter, when the prince of Orange is there,
tho&s;e in the government will &s;till look upon him to be King in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;
and, in all probability, tho&s;e who would otherwi&s;e have acquie&s;ced, and
have given your Maje&s;ty no oppo&s;ition, will be then under an obligation
<PB N="519" REF="543">
of acting to their power, for the prince of Orange. The&s;e are the &s;enti|ments

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>&startq;Rea&s;ons mo&s;t humbly offered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairre's Papers, D. N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 24.</NOTE> why ten thou&s;and men are &s;ufficient and &s;afe
for the King in per&s;on to make, at this time, a de&s;cent upon England; with
a propo&s;al for making the &s;aid de&s;cent.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>1&s;t, THAT the whole force now in England are but 14,000 men,
5000 whereof are to be immediately &s;ent abroad; &s;o that there
will remain in England but about 9000. Of this number 3000, at
lea&s;t, mu&s;t be left to maintain the face of a government at London; and
3000 more are the fewe&s;t which can be allowed for the garri&s;ons; &s;o
that there will not be above 3000 left to take the field whatever happen,
and even of the&s;e the King may hope for &s;ome &s;hare; for among&s;t the
whole there are not above 1600 foreigners.</P>
<P>2dly, That the great alterations occa&s;ioned by the prince&s;s of Orange's
death, hath &s;o broke and divided the &s;trength of the government, that
10,000 men are more now in proportion to its pre&s;ent &s;trength, than
30,000 were before: for the whole church of England party, who were
for him only upon her account, are now intirely broke off; and even
tho&s;e of them, who have no inclinations for the King, are fallen into the
prince&s;s of Denmark.</P>
<P>3dly, That the nation being thus divided into three parties, the prince
of Orange's mu&s;t certainly be the lea&s;t, for many plain rea&s;ons; but
e&s;pecially this, that no man will be &s;o mad as to oppo&s;e him&s;elf to the
King and his &s;on, the prince&s;s of Denmark and her &s;on, for the &s;ingle
life of the prince of Orange, &s;ince, after his death, they mu&s;t unavoid|ably
fall into &s;ome of their hands, even though they were &s;ecure during
his life, which no wi&s;e man will think him&s;elf.</P>
<P>4thly, That, &s;ince the de&s;ign and de&s;ire of both parties again&s;t him is
to de&s;troy him, it is plain either of them would join with the other &s;o to
do, and con&s;equently al&s;o plain, that both joined would be much too
&s;trong for him. What then can give the King any doubt, when he will
be joined by the prince&s;s's party and his own, which will certainly com|prehend
every body either from affection or fear?</P>
<P>5thly, That the great confu&s;ion and ferment through almo&s;t the
whole kingdom, upon the prince&s;s of Orange's death, is a plain and
<PB N="521" REF="545">
demon&s;trative proof, that the inclinations of the people are for the King,
and not thinking upon any other change: for the cry in the mouths of
the mobs was, freedom from taxes and foreigners and a re&s;toration of
their ancient laws and con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>6thly, That the pre&s;ent parliament (which is the only &s;upport the
prince of Orange hath to tru&s;t to, even though they &s;hould &s;tand by
him, upon &s;uch a juncture, which cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed) will be of no
great weight for him or again&s;t the King: for they are hated and &s;u&s;|pected
by the people, and not at all &s;peaking their &s;en&s;e, as appears by
what follows, viz.</P>
<P>What is the rea&s;on that this parliament hath, for the&s;e &s;everal la&s;t
&s;e&s;&s;ions, pre&s;&s;ed and endeavoured its own di&s;&s;olution? The an&s;wer is
plain, becau&s;e it knows that its di&s;&s;olution is de&s;ired by the people it re|pre&s;ents,
who&s;e re&s;entments it fears for &s;itting &s;o long again&s;t their inten|tions.
What then is the rea&s;on, why the people de&s;ires the di&s;&s;olution
of this parliament? The an&s;wer is al&s;o plain, becau&s;e they look upon
them to be corrupted and acting contrary to their intere&s;t and intentions.</P>
<P>What &s;trength then does the junction of this parliament add to the
prince of Orange? No more than he hath force to give a &s;anction to: for
it is not the &s;anction of a parliament, which the people hate and wi&s;h di&s;|&s;olved,
that makes them comply with its acts, but the force that is upon
them from the prince of Orange; and con&s;equently, whenever there is
a &s;uperior force oppo&s;ed to this force, all that &s;uch a parliament can do
will rather hurt than &s;ave him.</P>
<P>So that, from all the&s;e rea&s;ons, it is plain the King hath no ground to
fear any oppo&s;ition, that may be made either from the army, the coun|try,
or the parliament; but, on the contrary, &s;trong rea&s;ons to hope all
their concurrence, and con&s;equently can run no hazard, either as to &s;afety
or &s;ucce&s;s, in going with 10,000 men.</P>
<P>And to effect the making this de&s;cent, &s;ince captain Bart is of opinion
that, it the &s;hipping were ready, an army and all things nece&s;&s;ary might
be embarked in 48 hours, which is &s;o &s;hort a time, that no alarm could
be given; it is mo&s;t humbly propo&s;ed, that his Maje&s;ty would be
plea&s;ed to pre&s;s, with all vigour, that the King of France would have the
&s;hipping ready to wait for an occa&s;ion: for &s;everal will mo&s;t certainly hap|pen,
<PB N="522" REF="546">
before the &s;ummer be at an end, in which &s;uch an army may be
&s;afely tran&s;ported, without any danger from the Engli&s;h fleet: for, if
they &s;hould but go to the mouth of the Channel, or to Spithead, the
common place of their rendezvous (all things being ready at Dunkirk as
is propo&s;ed), the King might be embarked and over and landed, before
even they could have any notice; and &s;o (according to all probability)
po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of his crowns without any re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>And that, which is yet more encouraging for the King to pre&s;s this
propo&s;al, and for the court of France to undertake it, is, that, if any
unfore&s;een accident fall in between this and the executing of it, which
may either change again&s;t the King the circum&s;tances of affairs there, or
prevent the tran&s;portation, the further progre&s;s of it may be ea&s;ily and
&s;afely &s;topt, without any con&s;iderable lo&s;s or noi&s;e; the whole expence
of preparing the &s;hipping, even upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of 20,000, being
e&s;timated by captain Bart, not to exceed 100,000 livres. But le&s;t this
plain ea&s;y method of re&s;toring the King may &s;eem liable to this objec|tion,
that, though &s;o &s;mall a number, by taking advantage of &s;uch a &s;ur|prize,
and the prince of Orange being unprovided with troops there, be
&s;ufficient for the King to regain his kingdoms; yet they are not of force
enough to &s;ecure him again&s;t what the prince of Orange may be further
able to attempt again&s;t him. To clear up that difficulty, be plea&s;ed to
con&s;ider, where the prince of Orange may be, what he may endeavour
to do, and what may be the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e endeavours.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, he will certainly, if alive, be either in England or
abroad. If in England, it is not improbable, but he may fall into the
King's hands, and &s;o there's an end. But, though he may e&s;cape, it will
be &s;o mean and ignominious to have been beat out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion him&s;elf
in per&s;on, con&s;idering what he makes be believed abroad of the affec|tions
of the people for him, that none of his allies will ever think it
worth their while to make a fre&s;h attempt to re&s;tore him, though they
were in circum&s;tances &s;o to do, which &s;hall, by what follows, be made
appear otherwi&s;e. But it being more probable, that he will be then
abroad, be plea&s;ed to take a view of what he may endeavour to do, and
what &s;ucce&s;s his endeavours may have.</P>
<P>It may then be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he will then endeavour to get 20 or
30,000 good troops immediately tran&s;ported with him&s;elf into England;
<PB N="523" REF="547">
and that it is the intere&s;t of the allies to grant him &s;uch a number. But
to &s;hew, that his endeavours will be un&s;ucce&s;sful upon this, be plea&s;ed
to con&s;ider the following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>I&s;t, That this will happen when the armies are in the field, a time that
&s;uch a number cannot be &s;pared, without expo&s;ing, for want of them,
both the confederate army and their countries, which they cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed
to con&s;ent to, e&s;pecially con&s;idering how little they will then tru&s;t
to above 30,000 Briti&s;h among&s;t them, whom they will much rather be
afraid of then rely upon.</P>
<P>2d, That the allies (were there no other rea&s;on) will never con&s;ent to
expo&s;ing &s;o many of their troops on the other &s;ide, upon &s;o dangerous
and uncertain an event, e&s;pecially con&s;idering what mutual &s;atisfaction
will then publickly appear between the King and his people; add to
the&s;e rea&s;ons the hatred bore him in Holland, the enmity between him
and the Elector of Bavaria, and the great di&s;po&s;ition of all the branches
of the confederates for a peace; and then con&s;ider, if it be not much
more rea&s;onable to believe, that they will abandon him and treat with
France: for he will then have no money (as heretofore) to bribe mini|&s;ters
and others, which is the only charm he ever u&s;ed to keep him and
them cemented.</P>
<P>But next con&s;ider, that, though the allies &s;hould come over, all the&s;e
rea&s;ons (which cannot well be &s;uppo&s;ed) and re&s;olve to run all hazards
for him, and lend him 20 or 30,000 men, yet how can he get them
tran&s;ported, provided or paid; for then the &s;ource of his money will be
&s;topped, and not only &s;o, but in the King's hands, to be employed again&s;t
him; and what little &s;ums he may have left in Flanders will bear no
proportion to this matter, for the&s;e he hath only from hand to mouth;
and all his friends abroad joined together will not be able, at that time,
to furni&s;h him with a &s;um &s;ufficient for this expedition.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e, that all this were po&s;&s;ible for the prince of Orange,
(which cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed) yet the very fleet of England now for him
will then be again&s;t him, and prevent the tran&s;porting of any army.
For the King then, at Whitehall, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdoms, ma&s;ter
of all the &s;trengths and &s;tores, and of the very money given this &s;e&s;&s;ions
to the prince of Orange, a third part whereof will not be collected, will
<PB N="524" REF="548">
mo&s;t certainly have the fleet in all places declare for him; for though not
from affection, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity do it. Nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed,
that the fleet will ever go otherwi&s;e, than the kingdom, or e&s;pou&s;e again&s;t
their own country an intere&s;t upon a Dutch bottom, which they &s;o much
hate; and, which is yet more, all their families and fortunes will be in
the King's power; &s;o that their joining the King is not to be doubted,
and how then can the prince of Orange tran&s;port an army though he
had one?</P>
<P>So that there is a chain of plain rea&s;ons, every link of it &s;tronger than
another, which, according to all human rea&s;on, renders it altogether im|po&s;&s;ible
for the prince of Orange to make any fre&s;h attempt upon the
King, if he were once &s;o re&s;tored. Add to all this, what may rationally
be &s;uppo&s;ed to happen, upon the King's immediately &s;ending an envoy
into Flanders to offer his mediation for peace and the &s;ecurity of the
Briti&s;h troops there, and then con&s;ider, if it be not very plain, that this
&s;mall number propo&s;ed to re&s;tore his Maje&s;ty is al&s;o &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve
him when re&s;tored, again&s;t all the further attempts of the prince of
Orange. There are al&s;o many other rea&s;ons which might be joined to
the&s;e, as the whole kingdom being then de&s;perate with the prince of
Orange, the great number of known friends to the King, who never
took the oaths to him; all which his Maje&s;ty might arm upon any occa|&s;ion,
and who would as certainly fight for him, when on his throne, as
they &s;uffered and ventured their lives and fortunes for him when in exile.</P>
<P>In a letter written in cyphers about this time, by John Ander&s;on to the

He writes to Appleby, on the &s;ixth of June: &startq;As to the bale of goods, No. 219 [Fr. fleet], if you will con&s;ider and believe what I write to you concerning it, I need &s;ay no more of it.

He writes to Chapman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> on the 29th of June: &startq;I am concerned, that I cannot an&s;wer our wi&s;hes at pre&s;ent; and merely for the rea&s;on I have &s;o often informed you of: for I find no other objection made; but, on the contrary, very great forwardne&s;s, when that is removed; and then you may begin to look out &s;harp, if things continue in the &s;ame &s;itu|ation they are in at this time.&endq; On the 12th of July, he writes to Appleby. &startq;I could wi&s;h, with all my heart, that the account you have of the goods 219 [Fr. fleet] were true. It is not likely that the owner of them would let them rot in the warehou&s;e, at a time when he could di&s;po&s;e of them to &s;o great advantage.&endq;
On the 17th of Augu&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> he writes to Chapman. &startq;Our friend Ben&s;on [Fr.

His lord&s;hip writes to Ward, [col Sackville] on the 18th Oct. &startq;You cannot imagine how vexed I have been to hear of a rogue's being in your parts, who lived &s;ome time here: for I am very &s;en&s;ible that he may do a great deal of mi&s;chief. But, becau&s;e &s;ome good-natured people may make fine &s;tories, I &s;hall only mention the&s;e &s;hort facts. He had no leave, nor ever a&s;ked it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have received yours of the 26th of Augu&s;t and 23d of September,
which came to my hands about ten days after the other, and both of
them within the&s;e three weeks. I am &s;orry for the good rea&s;ons you give
me, of not hearing oftener from you and the worthy per&s;ons you name;
and I am very &s;en&s;ible both of the difficulty and danger you are in when
you do &s;end; and it is for that rea&s;on you do not hear oftener from me,
becau&s;e of the hazard of intercepting my letters, which to you might
prove trouble&s;ome: for, though in other matters you may imagine us in
great mi&s;ery, yet in this we are, both in &s;ending and receiving, in great
&s;ecurity, and therefore I &s;hall be always very cautious in expo&s;ing of
you, but when there is good cau&s;e for it; and when that is, I will not
fail of giving you timely adverti&s;ement, and that with as much &s;ecurity
as I can contrive.</P>
<P>Be not, therefore, anxious in expo&s;ing your&s;elves by writing often,
or expecting often to hear from me. When there is any thing material
upon your &s;ide, I know you will let us have it; and for what is com|mon,
&s;uch as the &s;tate of the pre&s;ent forces of the kingdom, may be
done by way of a common News Letter, without expo&s;ing any body,
and yet as much &s;aid as we &s;hall want to know.</P>
<P>The King is very &s;en&s;ible of your great endeavours for him; and you
may be per&s;uaded that, upon all occa&s;ions, I &s;hall give a ju&s;t account of
you and others as I am informed. Doctor Cockburn has left his cyphers
with me, and you may, as you have occa&s;ion, continue to write by
them. I am glad to hear of my lord Strathmore's good inclinations be|fore
his death, and of the good opinion you have of his &s;on, as I am of
Tarbat and Queen&s;berry's good behaviour in the parliament, which
&s;hould be enco$raged; and that the di&s;contents among our enemies prove
for our advantage, and that our friends per&s;evere, which, in a great
mea&s;ure, is beholding to the good management of you and your partners.</P>
<P><PB N="530" REF="554">
The King is very &s;en&s;ible of the good behaviour of the clergy and the
bi&s;hops; and I have taken particular notice what you &s;ay of the bi&s;hop
of Edinburgh. The King intreats all of you to continue and di&s;po&s;e of
every thing for the be&s;t; that, when it plea&s;eth God to give the oppor|tunity,
things may be found in a readine&s;s.</P>
<P>I do not remember that the two prie&s;ts &s;aid any thing of your affairs;
and I am &s;ure doctor Cockburn gave me no letter of the 25th February
from you. I keep very carefully all your letters that I have received
from him, and I find none of that date among&s;t them.</P>
<P>I have told you formerly, that the King was re&s;olved to have no &s;ecre|taries
of &s;tate for Scotland, till he be on the other &s;ide, as you have ad|vi&s;ed
him, and you may depend upon it; for he is &s;till in the &s;ame mind.</P>
<P>People coming from hence is not our fault: we have not wherewith
to maintain them. But if there be any among&s;t them that pretends to
have been tru&s;ted, or to deliver me&s;&s;ages, do not believe them. You
have been at this &s;port before, and may remember of the &s;traits you
were in; and that it was no more in the King's power then, than it is
now, to help it. As for &s;cribblers, if you can fix any thing upon any
per&s;on here, it would be good &s;ervice. But I a&s;&s;ure you the little affairs
we have is in &s;o few hands, that you may depend upon it, if you be
not deceived by the per&s;ons you tru&s;t, you &s;hall not by any means of
ours.</P>
<P>Sir Andrew Forre&s;ter went from hence by his own choice and de&s;ire;
the condition of his affairs obliging him to it.</P>
<P>I take what &s;ecretary John&s;ton &s;aid to you to be pumping and no
more; and I think it's ea&s;y for you to con&s;ider what letters could be
wrote to you from hence. I under&s;tand mine came &s;afe, and you may
know if Dr. Cockburn's did or not, or if you had any other corre&s;pon|dents.
By examining, in this manner, you will ea&s;ily find what letters
could come to you, and &s;o will the re&s;t; and I will be &s;o cautious in
bringing you into danger that way, that you may all be per&s;uaded I
will only trouble you when it is material and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and I

a&s;king any reward, or being inve&s;ted with any character, exerted him&s;elf
in promoting James's intere&s;ts at Rome, was &s;u&s;pected of favouring the
Au&s;trians. Ellis, however, was never authori&s;ed to appear in any public
character; and he was ordered to repair to his dioce&s;e &s;oon after the
earl of Perth arrived this year.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 129.</NOTE> There are copies of an&s;wers to &s;ome of

<P>&startq;I AM trying, by Dom. Guilielmo Le&s;ly's informations, how this
court is inclined; and I find that artifice and juggle has &s;o mi&s;re|pre&s;ented
the &s;tate of the affair of the u&s;urpation, that, as if men had
re&s;olved either to appear &s;uch fools as to be impo&s;ed upon by mere
open villany, or &s;uch profe&s;&s;ed wicked per&s;ons, as to own to &s;upport all
the mon&s;trous inju&s;tice done his Maje&s;ty, and the per&s;ecutions brought
<PB N="532" REF="556">
upon his catholic &s;ubjects; they will appear per&s;uaded, that to humble
France, by any means, was not only lawful, but a nece&s;&s;ary duty.&endq;</P>
<P>June 6th, 1695. Mon&s;eigneur Caprara is full of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;peaks
very &s;eldom to me of affairs, e&s;pecially the King's. I find he has no
hopes of the King's re&s;toration, (if he deals &s;incerely by me;) and really
all here (if one &s;hould take &s;ix for one to be the all) are very cold in
our concerns. Pre&s;s them with the inju&s;tice the King meets with. You
will get a cold, &startq;Yes, he is ill dealt by: but what &s;hall we do to get
a peace? For the prince, if he lives, will reign, no doubt: but how
turn out the prince of Orange? He is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He is brave and
wi&s;e, and has got the way of managing England. He is ma&s;ter of
Holland: he is the cement that glues together the different intere&s;ts of
the confederacy. If, at la&s;t, the collegati &s;hould fail him; if England
&s;hould grow unea&s;y, he has money laid up, an army at his devotion,
and will trouble Europe, if he get not leave to live out his u&s;urped po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion?&endq;
This is the common talk; and even &s;ome we look on as our
firm friends, in&s;inuate this to be rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>I can ea&s;ily perceive, that all who are well affected to the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria, try, by all means, to per&s;uade the Pope, that the prince of
Orange is no enemy to the catholics; but only &s;trives to maintain his
acqui&s;ition of the government of England. Mon&s;eigneur Caprara,
the other day, when I was to &s;ee him, told me, that he had acquainted
his holine&s;s with my de&s;ign to pay my duty to him; and that, although
the prince of Orange had obliged me not to go to France, he had allowed
me to come thither. I told Mon&s;ieur that it was not &s;o; but that I
was bani&s;hed ab&s;olutely. I might go to France if I would. The danger
flowed from a late act, not from any prohibition: that the prince of
Orange had no mind I &s;hould be here: that his love was no greater to
the Pope than to France. O! but, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t not tell him &s;o.
I told him I would; and that any, who had a mind to make him pa&s;s
for a friend to catholics, injured my ma&s;ter and the truth at once. O!
&s;aid he, but the old man &s;eemed &s;o glad, that you had leave to come
thither, and you mu&s;t not contradict what &s;eemed &s;o acceptable to him.
I told him plainly I would undeceive him, and let him know how our
mi&s;&s;ionaries were bani&s;hed (a matter which father Le&s;slie has handled too
nicely, as I have told him roundly enough; for I was forced to &s;ay, that
<PB N="533" REF="557">
no Je&s;uit in Britain would have done as he did); that the addre&s;&s;es
carried, that he had bani&s;hed popery and tyranny, meaning a catholic
King for being catholic, and that he made it an in&s;trument of &s;upport|ting
his u&s;urpation, his boa&s;ting of his being an enemy to popery; and

<P>&startq;I Said all I could think of before him [pope], that could move him to
have a true &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of the King's &s;ufferings; demon&s;trating,
that no earthly power could have hurt the King, &s;ave by the concurrence
of catholic princes, and not they neither, if the King had been of the
religion of his dominions. This he &s;eemed firmly to believe, and
called the King a &s;aint. This being &s;o, then, I &s;aid, that all that his
Holine&s;s could do for him was but too little: that there was now in
Rome a great talking of peace, and upon &s;uch terms, as if con&s;ented to,
or even permitted, would be a &s;tain upon his Holine&s;s's reputation, and
a reflection upon the apo&s;tolique chair. He &s;aid it was true. But what
can we do? I have done and will do, what, humanly &s;peaking, is po&s;|&s;ible:
but catholic princes will not hearken to me; they have lo&s;t the
re&s;pect that u&s;ed to be paid to popes: religion is gone, and a wicked
policy &s;et up in its place. But, I &s;aid, that he could &s;till prevent a peace
with the King's exclu&s;ion in it. God knows, he &s;aid, to re&s;tore the
King, I would give my blood; but Chri&s;tians have lo&s;t all re&s;pect, even
to us; to us! &s;aid he. But can it be believed, continued his Holine&s;s,
that I &s;hould ever con&s;ent to any peace, that excludes that good King
from his ju&s;t right. God forbid! God forbid! But what will become
of all this? The prince of Orange is ma&s;ter: he is arbiter of Europe.
The Europeans and King of Spain are &s;laves, and wor&s;e than &s;ubjects to
him. They neither will nor dare venture to di&s;plea&s;e him; and here he
&s;truck twice with his hand upon the table, and &s;ighed. If God, (&s;aid he),
by &s;ome &s;troke of omnipotency, do it not, we are undone. I pre&s;&s;ed

him to reflect, that this was really a war of religion. He &s;aid, that they
were blind who did not &s;ee that. La&s;t of all, I laid before him the piti|ful
ca&s;e of the poor catholics, who, having followed their ma&s;ter,
were now reduced to extreme mi&s;ery. God help them! &s;aid he; but
what can I do? If I &s;hould do any thing, I am cryed out upon, as
favouring France, who are pu&s;hing to be ma&s;ters of all. However, he
&s;aid, he was convinced, that all I &s;aid was mo&s;t rea&s;onable, and that
he would think upon it. In the mean time, I am very confident he will
never con&s;ent, or even wink at any peace, by which his Maje&s;ty may
&s;uffer in his ju&s;t rights; and this is one great point; and for the money
part of it, I hope, with him, we may obtain &s;omewhat. Meanwhile, I

<P>I Doubt not, but you will find there [at Rome] all the outward civi|lities,
that you can expect, both from his Holine&s;s and from the
cardinals: but to get any money from him to &s;upply the great nece&s;&s;itys
of his Maje&s;tie's &s;uffering &s;ubjects, for their loyalty and religion, I fear
will be a difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k; and yet to &s;atisfy tho&s;e that
are in want, at lead, of his Maje&s;tie's endeavours for them, it &s;hall be
attempted in the proper &s;ea&s;on, when you &s;hall judge his Holine&s;s be&s;t
prepared to receive an addre&s;s of that nature. But, before any thing of
that be done, his Holine&s;s ought to be made &s;en&s;ible of his Maje&s;tie's de|votion
to the &s;ee apo&s;tolick, and how much he has &s;uffered for it: that
any general peace, that &s;hall exclude the King and own the u&s;urper,
will, in every re&s;pect, be like that between Herod and Pilate: That,
who endeavours it, or contributes towards it, upon the&s;e terms, is a be|trayer
of the catholic religion, and makes a &s;acrifice of it to worldly
intere&s;t: that, as the church is built upon a rock, &s;o the piety and zeal
of his Holine&s;s, for the hou&s;e of God, ought to &s;tand firm again&s;t all
human re&s;pects and politick in&s;inuations to the contrary. I fear his
Holine&s;s &s;tands a little in need of &s;uch repre&s;entations as the&s;e to be
warmly made to him, in regard of the violent inclination he has to pro|cure
a peace in Europe, at any rate; that he may be freed from the fear

that a part mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to &s;ave the whole; that Europe mu&s;t be

<DATE>July 4, 1695.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR lord&s;hip's of the 6th and 7th of June are happily arrived;
giving, in the fir&s;t place, a very natural account of the temper and
di&s;po&s;ition of the court of Rome, where, as your lord&s;hip very well ob|&s;erves,
intere&s;t does not reign, but tyrannize, and truly it requires a virtue
no le&s;s con&s;ummated and try'd than our ma&s;ters; and give me leave al&s;o
to add, your lord&s;hip's not to be &s;candalized, at &s;o much of the &s;cribe
and phari&s;ee &s;o near the chair of Mo&s;es. In the mean time, it is no &s;mall
comfort to every true Chri&s;tian to find, that his Holine&s;s him&s;elf, of all
the court of Rome, is the lea&s;t tainted with that corrupt policy, which
makes a &s;acrifice of ju&s;tice and even of religion to wordly intere&s;t.
But the&s;e &s;ages at Rome, as clear &s;ighted as they think them&s;elves to be,
will &s;hortly find how much they are mi&s;taken, in their calculation of
affairs. For I dare affirm to your lord&s;hip, upon very certain grounds,
<PB N="536" REF="562">
that this confederacy cannot hold two years to an end;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> and that the
King of France has it now in his power, to be once more the arbiter of
the peace of Europe. To make this evident, I need only &s;hew, that
England, the main &s;upport of the league, cannot po&s;&s;ibly any longer bear
the weight; and that this &s;ummer's campaign, by land and by &s;ea, is
the la&s;t effort, which our nation can or will make, becau&s;e their pre&s;ent
aver&s;ion to the government of the prince of Orange is as great as the
nece&s;&s;ity and want of money, which that government has brought them
to; and to confirm all this, I &s;end you here, an authentic account of the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of England, together with a copy of the letter, which ac|companied
it, writ to me by the bi&s;hop of Norwich; which I de&s;ire your
lord&s;hip to &s;hew to nobody, except cardinal Jan&s;on, but to make what
u&s;e you &s;hall think be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>His Holine&s;s needs not be di&s;couraged, at the unju&s;t reproaches of
the Au&s;trians, &s;tiling him a partizan of France, becau&s;e he will not make
one with them, in a league with heretics. For he will have very &s;hortly
the &s;atisfaction to fee the Divine Providence no le&s;s in the French in|tere&s;t,
than him&s;elf; and that &s;candalous league, thought &s;o invincible at
Rome, &s;uddenly fall to the ground. I confe&s;s, I cannot be but a&s;toni&s;h|ed
at the maxims of the good a&s;&s;i&s;tant of Germany at the Gje&s;u, who
will have every thing to be lawful and holy, which the Emperor does.
But I would fain know of that con&s;cientious divine, if Teckeli &s;hould
make him&s;elf King of Hungary, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the Emperor of all his
other dominions, what he would think of any Engli&s;h Je&s;uit, that &s;hould
maintain, that for the &s;ake of peace, Tekeli, though a Calvini&s;t, ought
to be let continue in his u&s;urpation; and yet the other catholic princes
mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon any treaty of peace, to have him &s;o continued? Let
tho&s;e directors of con&s;cience look to it, and look to them&s;elves; for a
day of reckoning will come, when a wilful mi&s;take, or an affected igno|rance
of matters of fact will not &s;erve their turn. But I hope, before that
time, God will mercifully open their eyes and touch their hearts, that
they may &s;ee and repent. The au&s;picious entrance, which your lord&s;hip
made, in your fir&s;t audience with his Holine&s;s, very much leads there-unto;
and, to &s;ay the truth, you have already, in a manner, fini&s;hed a
work, which was of the greate&s;t importance to his Maje&s;ty's concerns,
in leaving a true idea of his Maje&s;ty's ca&s;e in his Holine&s;s's mind; and,
<PB N="537" REF="563">
con&s;equent thereunto, a re&s;olution in him never to abandon his intere&s;t,
nor con&s;ent to a peace prejudicial thereunto.</P>
<P>There &s;eems nothing more to remain for your lord&s;hip to do, but to
pre&s;erve and confirm, in his Holine&s;s, the&s;e his ju&s;t and pious &s;entiments
towards his Maje&s;ty, to whom I mu&s;t leave it, to let you know, under
his own hand, how acceptable to him the &s;ervice is, which you have
now done him with his Holine&s;s, which you may expect the next po&s;t;
for he and the Queen are, at pre&s;ent, both ab&s;ent from St. Germains,
but will return this night, having &s;pent four or five days &s;everally in a
ramble of devotion, the King at La Trappe and the Queen at Chaliot.
The prince and prince&s;s are in perfect health, and grow up to the won|der
of every body.</P>
<P>Your lord&s;hip's of the 14th, is now come to me, which containing no
bu&s;ine&s;s, will oblige me to add no more to what I have above written;
but that I am, with true re&s;pect,</P>

the favour of yours of the 9th, by which I find, that we agree
in our &s;entiments, or rather in our apprehen&s;ions, concerning a peace.
The truth of the matter is, that all the world crys out for it, and no

that what your lord&s;hip has received from the mouth of his Holine&s;s, that

<P>SEPTEMBER the 6th, 1695.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, D. N. vol. ii. 410. No. 36.</NOTE> &startq;At this court, our affairs will never
thrive, until we be in a better condition in the world; for it is not
what is due to his Maje&s;ty, as rightfully King of his Maje&s;tie's domi|nions,
or as having lo&s;t the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them for the catholic faith; but
what his friend&s;hip can import to Rome, that is the mea&s;ure of the fa|vour
of this court.&endq;</P>
<P>September the 27th. &startq;The confederates confe&s;s, that, had the prince
of Orange been driven from before Namur, they would have aban|doned
him; but now he is &s;aviour, protector, and idol; all the heros of
antiquity are but his precur&s;ors; and, to triumph over the King of
France's fore&s;ight and coun&s;el, and over the Mare&s;chals of Villeroy and
Bu&s;&s;lers, is &s;o great a &s;upport to his reputation, that all here con|clude,
that he will unite the league (if a peace be not &s;truck up very &s;oon)
and get from England to their bodkins and thimbles. Now all our
conver&s;ations are bringing the King to Rome, which God forbid, and
e&s;tabli&s;hing the prince of Orange in England for all his life, be it long
or &s;hort; and &s;ome, who appeared very fixed, begin to &s;ay, that the
prince of Orange mu&s;t be a great man, who never gives over but pu&s;hes
on, though repelled again and again, and that, at la&s;t, &s;uch a one mu&s;t
accompli&s;h his de&s;igns, which is to humble the King of France, and to
transfer all the glory of this King's fortunate reign to him&s;elf, by re|ducing
him to his own terms. But, upon the other hand, both the
emperor's people and the Spaniards here, begin to look about them.
They &s;ee, that the prince of Orange is ab&s;olute ma&s;ter in their parts of
the low countries: he is &s;o too in Holland. If the King of Spain dies,
he can give him a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and fortify the prote&s;tants &s;o in Germany,
as to reduce the Emperor to do what he plea&s;es, and &s;ome of them pray
to God heartily, that he were knocked on the head.</P>
<P>&startq;But happen what will, I hope the King will never come thither,
where, except his Holine&s;s and a very few cardinals, and (in proportion)
far fewer of other people, he has but few friends, and many to in&s;ult
over his &s;ufferings; and really, it's &s;candalous to hear what is &s;aid every
day publickly, when they make compari&s;ons betwixt an heretical, unna|tural,

<P>&startq;THE town of Newca&s;tle, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in England, is
&s;ituated at the di&s;tance of a league from the &s;ea, on the river Tyne,
which &s;eparates the county of Northumberland from the bi&s;hoprick of
Durham. At the mouth of this river &s;tands a large village, called Tin|mouth,
with a fort, which commands the entry. But it is in bad repair
towards the land. Ve&s;&s;els of 500 tons can enter the harbour.</P>
<P>The town is &s;urrounded only by an old ruinous wall, without ram|parts

from thence, and from Sunderland, a &s;mall town at three leagues di&s;|tance,
<PB N="542" REF="570">
which is &s;carcely known, but by the nobleman, who takes his
title from it.</P>
<P>From London to Newca&s;tle, there are &s;eventy leagues of as fine a
country as is in the world; fifteen from Newca&s;tle to Scotland; and
twenty to Lanca&s;ter. In the counties of York, We&s;tmoreland, Cumber|land,
Northumberland, and in the bi&s;hoprick of Durham, are all the
excellent &s;tuds; con&s;equently the cavalry and dragoons might be ea&s;ily
mounted. Be&s;ides, 20,000 carriage and cart hor&s;es, which carry coals
from the mines to Newca&s;tle and Sunderland, will be found in that coun|try,
and may be u&s;eful for carrying the baggage of the army. But a more
important con&s;ideration is, that the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants of
the&s;e di&s;tricts are well affected towards his Maje&s;ty, and may join him
without any hinderance. The length of the navigation is the only ob|jection
that can be fore&s;een; to which it may be an&s;wered, that the dif|ficulty
con&s;i&s;ts in failing from Dunkirk and leaving the coa&s;t; but that
&s;hips, when they are once at &s;ea, have nothing to fear, and it is immate|rial
whether the de&s;cent is made on the &s;econd or on the fourth day. It
is proper to remark, that the favourable wind for this pa&s;&s;age is the S.
and S. E. which will hinder the &s;hips in the Downs from putting to &s;ea.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;WE are much divided here, in Holland [France], about the
Scotti&s;h $$&s;t India Company; nor can we well &s;ee how
that matter can be &s;ettled, without a di&s;pen&s;ing power, in a ca&s;e where
people's properties are concerned, which was never yet pretended to; nor
is it credible, that the Scotch can be hectored into &s;uch a &s;ervile com|pliance,
as to &s;acrifice their mo&s;t undoubted right, manife&s;t intere&s;t, and
boa&s;ted independence.&mdash;I mu&s;t needs tell you a &s;tory, which I had from
a factor of this $a&s;t India Company, when they had the news in India of
the revolution in England. The general of Batavia &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador
to the Mogul, who, among other things, told him, that they had drove
away the Engli&s;h King, and &s;ent a &s;ervant of theirs to rule that people;
to which old Aurengzebe replied, That he was glad of it: that the Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="543" REF="571">
had wickedly defrauded his &s;ubjects of what was ju&s;tly due to them;
and, again&s;t the public faith, had plundered them at &s;ea; and, now,
that they had &s;ubdued them, he expected they &s;hould make him repara|tion.
Depend on it, this &s;tory is &s;eriou&s;ly true<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was upon this occa&s;ion, that an envoy from the Engli&s;h company is &s;aid to have claimed a precedence over the Dutch envoy, alleging that he was the &s;ervant of a great King, like the Emperor him&s;elf, and ought to be heard before the repre&s;entative of a par|cel of merchants. The repre&s;entation had &s;ome weight with Aurengzebe, till the Dutch|man made this reply: &startq;It is true, he is the &s;ervant of a great King, but that great King is one of our merchants. The Engli&s;h could not carry on their own bu&s;ine&s;s, and, therefore, we &s;ent one of our factors, to command them and &s;ettle their accounts.&endq; This mercan|tile inference, &s;ays tradition, &s;ettled the point of precedence, for that time, in favour of the Dutchman.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The earl of Middleton wrote &s;everal letters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers, D. N. vol i. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> in the cour&s;e of this and
the en&s;uing month to Chapman, Sy&s;on, Ward [Sackville], Clelland
[Waugh], and Green [Sir Andrew Forre&s;ter], giving them hopes of an
immediate inva&s;ion. In one of his letters to Chapman, dated the 24th
of January, he &s;peaks of Powel's journey to France. &startq;I am not &s;orry,
that Mr. Powel thinks of vi&s;iting us: for he will be quickly undeceived,
in what you &s;u&s;pect; and be able to &s;et all matters in a true light, at his
return, if his &s;incerity is equal to his capacity.&endq;</P>
<P>On the 26th of February,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE> he writes to Ward. &startq;Mr. Smith
[K. James] bid me tell you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> that his partner [Fr. King] has the mo|ney
ready; but that he will not pay it, till the company [the adherents
of James] has taken up the goods No. 953 [arms]; and, upon the fir&s;t
notice of it [in&s;urrection], he will immediately di&s;patch away Mr. Smith
[K. James] to conclude the bargain. Pray let us know your opinion
of this matter; for as it is important, &s;o it requires ha&s;te; and, if this
opportunity be lo&s;t, it may prove fatal to the company.&endq;</P>
<P>The King of France in&s;i&s;ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> that James's friends, in England, &s;hould
take arms, before the French troops embarked. The following letter,
from lord Middleton to his corre&s;pondent Sy&s;on, relates to this circum|&s;tance.
It is dated the 26th February.</P>
<P>&startq;This is only to acknowledge the favour of yours of the 5th in&s;tant,
&s;ince it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat what you have from the be&s;t hand.
<PB N="544" REF="572">
Be&s;ides that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> old Watt Freeman [probably D. of Berwick] mu&s;t have
&s;een you before this comes to you. He can be&s;t inform you, though,
perhaps, not &s;atisfy you: for there is one of the marriage articles which
appears very difficult to perform; and, though &s;omething ought to be
ventured, yet what is altogether unrea&s;onable ought to be con&s;idered as
impo&s;&s;ible; but of this you can only judge.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Charnock, in May 1695, and lord Aile&s;bury, &s;oon after, were
&s;ent to Fiance to per&s;uade James to invade England the next winter,
with a French army, and to acquaint him with the in&s;urrections then in|tended
in different parts of the kingdom. The duke of Berwick came
over, in the beginning of this year, to concert a plan of operations with
his friends, and to head the in&s;urgents. James left St. Germains before
the return of his &s;on. He met him however at Clermont, and carried
him back to Calais. Having 20,000 men under his direction in that
neighbourhood and near Dunkirk, he drew up a declaration, in which
he conceals that diffidence of &s;ucce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D N. vol. i. fol. No. 132.</NOTE> which Middleton betrays, in the pre|ceding
corre&s;pondence. For the intrigues of Charnock, Sir George Bar|clay,
Sir William Perkins, captain Porter, and others, were not yet di&s;|covered
in England. The declaration, however, was not publi&s;hed,
for the rea&s;ons mentioned by the earl of Middleton, in the following

<P>&startq;THE King has commanded me to tell you, that he finds many diffi|culties

he was invited, by a great part of the nation, can be of no advantage to

rai&s;ing the per&s;ecution higher again&s;t his friends, who may thereby be

to de&s;ire to expo&s;e, without rea&s;on, this army, which he con&s;iders as the
only bridge by which he can find his way to England, would be not

<P>We have not been able to procure any intelligence of the enemy's

<P>The con&s;pirators in England were &s;eized, tried, and executed. The

to be &s;ent by him to his Holine&s;s.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tran&s;lation.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;AS his Holine&s;s has always given con&s;picuous proofs of his ju&s;tice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE>
and of his zeal for the good of the church, it will be unnece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="552" REF="580">
to employ arguments to per&s;uade him of the iniquity of the prince of
Orange;<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> nor to excite him to embrace, with warmth, the intere&s;ts of
his Britannic Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>One cannot &s;ee, without a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;o many catholic princes in a
league to &s;trengthen the enemies of their holy r$ligion; his mo$$ Chri&s;|tian
Maje&s;ty having alone &s;upported that cau&s;e, and, by his genero&s;ity,
which will render his glory immortal, protected his Britannic Maje&s;ty,
who is oppre&s;&s;ed by a violence and barbarity which di&s;grace the name
of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The two crowns of the North are in a profound peace; and the
princes of Germany are powerfully armed, while the Catholics are ruined;
and the church was never threatened with &s;o much danger as it is now
&s;ince Julian the Apo&s;tate. It is not, therefore, doubted but his Holine&s;s
will think him&s;elf obliged to employ vigorou&s;ly all the power with which
God hath inve&s;ted him, in order to withdraw the Catholics from &s;uch
pernicious engagements, by repre&s;enting to them, in the mo&s;t lively co|lours,
what they owe to religion; that their &s;alvation is at &s;take; that
they &s;hould not per&s;i&s;t in rendering them&s;elves accomplices in the in|ju&s;tice
of the prince of Orange, by &s;upporting his u&s;urpation, and by
rendering him the arbiter of all their concerns; and that they cannot
expiate their faults, but by contributing to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his
Britannic Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>But if, to puni&s;h them, God abandons them to their blindne&s;s, and
that the &s;tate to which Europe is reduced will oblige it to conclude a
peace, without doing ju&s;tice to his Britannic Maje&s;ty, he hopes that his
Holine&s;s will not allow him&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed by the artful expedients
which the mediators may propo&s;e; as his Britannic Maje&s;ty will never
con&s;ent that his inconte&s;tible right &s;hould be called in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, it cannot be denied but, by receiving a pen&s;ion from
the prince of Orange, though there were never &s;o much cau&s;e for it,
his Britannic Maje&s;ty would tacitly renounce his right; and if he con|&s;ented
that, after the death of the prince of Orange, his royal highne&s;s
the prince of Wales, his &s;on, reigned in his life-time, that would be a
$ormal renounciation; and the prince of Orange could only promi&s;e a
<PB N="553" REF="581">
thing which he is not able to perform; becau&s;e the parliament, who
conferred the royal authority on him, &s;ettled the rever&s;ion of the crown on
the prince&s;s Anne of Denmark. But, &s;uppo&s;ing further, that the prince
of Orange could and would oblige the Engli&s;h to revoke that &s;ettlement,
it would be always on condition of bringing over the prince of Wales
into England, without their being able to give any &s;ecurity for his con|&s;cience
or his per&s;on; and it is firmly believed, that his Holine&s;s will
never give his advice or con&s;ent to a mea&s;ure which may have &s;uch fatal
con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The prince of Wales, by &s;ucceeding to the prince of Orange, yields
his &s;ole right, which is that of his father; and, being obliged to the
people for his elevation, would not reign, but during their plea&s;ure;
and, if his Britannic Maje&s;ty was capable of con&s;enting to &s;o di&s;graceful
a propo&s;al, he might be ju&s;tly reproached with ruining the monarchy,
which has been always hereditary, by rendering it elective, and with &s;a|crificing
to an enemy all that is mo&s;t dear to him.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, his Maje&s;ty has &s;o much regard and affection for his
loyal &s;ubjects, that, when a treaty of peace is begun, he intreats his
Holine&s;s to endeavour to make &s;ome &s;tipulation in their favour, which
may protect them again&s;t the cruel per&s;ecutions they have &s;uffered in the
time pa&s;t, and which may re&s;tore them to their e&s;tates; and that, at
lea&s;t, they may be at liberty to return home in &s;afety, without being
obliged to enter into illegal engagements; and that tho&s;e who, accord|ing
to their duty, would attach them&s;elves to his &s;ervice for the future,
may not be treated as criminals.</P>
<P>By attentions &s;o ju&s;t and &s;o generous, his Holine&s;s will &s;ecure the re|verence
of po&s;terity to his pontificate; and, by acquitting him&s;elf of his
duty towards God, will be able to give a good account of his mini&s;try.&endq;</P>

<P>After the execution of the con&s;pirators in England, James found it

<P>&startq;I Was very glad to find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. 4to. No. 5.</NOTE> by your letter, that you were in &s;afety.
His Maje&s;ty approves of what you have done, and propo&s;ed for
his &s;ervice; and would have you give him an account of the per&s;ons
de&s;igned to carry the pacquets to and from the water-&s;ide, and what is
to be given to each per&s;on re&s;pectively who are to be concerned in the
management of this affair.&endq;</P>
<P>On the 4th of Augu&s;t, he wrote to Mr. Pigault, merchant at Calais.
&startq;I de&s;ire the favour of you, that you would let me know the parti|culars

to act in his place, as appears by a letter he wrote of the &s;ame date
to mon&s;ieur Bretagne. &startq;The great difficulty,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;we find in
&s;etting up our corre&s;pondence, is the want of a per&s;on, &s;uch as we had

<P>&startq;Mr. Berkenhead having e&s;caped from the pri&s;on of Newgate in
London, came to the &s;hore, where he luckily found a French ve&s;&s;el;
and, the next night, he came a-&s;hore, near the hou&s;e of one Hunt, who
had given information to the government again&s;t him, and again&s;t &s;e|veral

who fired a pi&s;tol at him, he carried him away by force, and brought

<P>It was univer&s;ally believed, that all Europe was now on the eve of

<P>ACcording to the mo&s;t ancient laws and cu&s;toms of England, which
are &s;till in force, Queens have their full right and power, in their
own per&s;on, their e&s;tates and reve$$es, independently of the Kings,
their hu&s;bands, by virtue of which, they have always had officers of
their revenue, who depended entirely on them, and all their acts have
<PB N="558" REF="586">
been valid, without the con&s;ent or concurrence of the Kings their
hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>As the Queen of England brought a very con&s;iderable &s;um, as her por|tion
at her marriage, the King, her hu&s;band, on his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown,
thought it was rea&s;onable for him to make an e&s;tabli&s;hment of fifty
thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, of an annual revenue, on her, which was pa&s;&s;ed
under the great &s;eal of England, and afterwards, for the greater &s;ecurity,
was confirmed by acts of parliament, which have not been repealed to this
day; in&s;omuch, that the Queen has an inconte&s;tible right to all the ar|rears
of this revenue, which are due &s;ince &s;he left England, as well as
to tho&s;e which &s;hall be due hereafter.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty only a&s;ks this, &s;imply and purely, as a private debt, which
is inconte&s;tibly due to her&s;elf; and of which &s;he only &s;ets forth a &s;tate,

<P>AS all Sovereigns ought to con&s;ider the cau&s;e of his Britannick Ma|je&s;ty
as their own, one mu&s;t believe, that ju&s;tice and rea&s;on will
in&s;pire them with the de&s;ign of bringing about his re&s;toration.</P>
<P>But if, to puni&s;h England, God leaves it to complain, &s;ome time
longer, under the yoke of an u&s;urped dominion, we are per&s;uaded, that
all Chri&s;tian princes will concur unanimou&s;ly, in protecting, from the
&s;ury of their enemies, men of honour, who have acted from no other
motives, than tho&s;e of duty and of con&s;cience; and the catholic princes
are mo&s;t intere&s;ted in providing for the &s;afety of tho&s;e poor catholics,
who are mo&s;t expo&s;ed, on account of their religion, to the malice of
their enemies, who may re&s;ume and complete the de&s;ign they had formed
and commenced, 18 years ago, to ruin all the catholics. We have &s;een
a great deal of innocent blood &s;hed, on pretence of crimes of &s;tate, and
upon the fal&s;e te&s;timonies of &s;ome villains.</P>
<P>It is therefore propo&s;ed to the&s;e princes, to &s;end orders to their pleni|potentiaries,
to &s;tipulate, in the treaty of peace, an indemnity to all his
<PB N="559" REF="587">
Britannick Maje&s;tie's &s;ubjects, for all they have done for his &s;ervice; and
to obtain, that all the &s;entences pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them may be rever&s;ed,
and each of them re&s;tored to his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>And, as it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for his Britannick Maje&s;ty to be
attended by his own &s;ubjects, it is propo&s;ed to &s;tipulate al&s;o in this
treaty, that tho&s;e who now attend him, may be allowed to remain, with|out
being liable to be called to account for it afterwards.</P>
<P>Examples of &s;uch indemnities are not wanting, in mo&s;t of the trea$$es
of peace, particularly in tho&s;e of We&s;tphalia and the Pyrenees, with this
difference, that in other treaties, criminals have been pardoned; and that,

He endeavoured, in vain, to di&s;&s;uade the King of France from it; and

<P>JAMES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Pa|pers, D. N. vol. i. fol. No. 138.</NOTE> in this memorial, endeavours to &s;how, that France can derive
no &s;ecurity from a peace, if the prince of Orange &s;hall be permitted
to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in his u&s;urpation: that he hath been always un&s;uc|ce&s;sful

of peace, to &s;tir up all Europe again&s;t France; and would continue to do
&s;o, while he was allowed to govern England and Holland. &startq;It is but
too evident, that all Europe are now in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions towards the
French, in which they were formerly towards the Spaniards. They
would, undoubtedly, wi&s;h to &s;ee them humbled; and it is not to be

is u&s;ual among neighbours, &s;hould be of the &s;ame &s;entiments. But it
ought to be remarked, that a King of England, who is a catholic, who&s;e
&s;ubjects ate prote&s;tants, will always have occa&s;ion for the friend&s;hip of
France, in order to maintain his authority, and defend him&s;elf from the
in&s;ults of his own &s;ubjects, of which he will be in continual danger, on
account of their inveterate aver&s;ion to whatever they call popery.&endq;</P>
<P>From the&s;e and &s;everal other rea&s;ons, James infers, that any kind of
peace with the prince of Orange, would be to France, &startq;but a fire

covered with a&s;hes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">January.</NOTE>&endq; But that a peace would be both advantageous and
permanent, if he was once re-e&s;tabli&s;hed on his throne. He repeats,
in the remaining part of the memorial, rea&s;ons, which he had often
mentioned, for invading Britain. The &s;ame things, with &s;ome exagger|ations
of the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es of England and Holland, are differently
expre&s;&s;ed and enlarged upon, in another memorial. It is in Nairne's

<P>THERE is an Engli&s;hman arrived here, who calls him&s;elf Vane,
without a pa&s;&s;port and without recommendations; and there is not
one man in the place, who knows him. This fellow has had the im|pudence
<PB N="562" REF="590">
to propo&s;e to me, an attempt on the prince of Orange's life;
and, as I rejected this propo&s;al, with aver&s;ion, the conver&s;ation
fini&s;hed. But when I gave an account of it to the King, my ma&s;ter,
le&s;t the man &s;hould make his e&s;cape, he &s;poke to the count de Druis, to
&s;ecure his per&s;on, until the King's orders about him &s;hould be received.
It is for this rea&s;on, the King of England de&s;ires you to inform his Ma|je&s;ty
of this adventure immediately; it being his opinion, that the &s;aid
Vane &s;hould be clo&s;ely impri&s;oned; but in other re&s;pects, well treated;

<P>&startq;1$t, YOU mu&s;t have a care in your carriage and conver&s;ation, to
appear only as a dome&s;tic of Mon&s;ieur de Croi&s;&s;y, and not as
a per&s;on commi&s;&s;ioned or imployed by his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>2dly, In your conferences, with Mon&s;ieur de Croi&s;&s;y him&s;elf, you mu&s;t
not appear to be anywi&s;e inqui&s;itive about matters relating to his nego|ciation,
or in his matter's affairs; but mu&s;t only treat with him concern|ing
the particular concerns of his Maje&s;ty, according to your in&s;truc|tions.</P>
<P>3dly, You mu&s;t endeavour to keep it as a &s;ecret, even to tho&s;e at

you have any dependance on his Maje&s;ty, unle&s;s by Mr. Croi&s;&s;y's own
appointment, you be directed to confer with any &s;ecretary of his, about
the matters you are intru&s;ted withal.</P>
<P>4thly, You mu&s;t regularly, twice a week, give an account to one of
his Maje&s;ty's &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, of all matters that come to your know|ledge,
<PB N="563" REF="591">
either concerning his Maje&s;ty's own affairs, or the treaty of peace,
in general.</P>
<P>5thly, The affairs of his Maje&s;ty, which you are to treat upon, with
Mon&s;ieur de Croi&s;&s;y or the other plenipotentiaries of France, are
this: fir&s;t, her Maje&s;ty's appanage, for the doing of which, you are re|ferred
to the paper concerning it, already &s;ent to the plenipotentiary, of
which you may carry along with you a copy. Now, in ca&s;e the prince
of Orange's agents, &s;hould deny or que&s;tion any matters of fact, as they
are &s;et down in that paper, which &s;o plainly prove the queen's right,
even according to their own pre&s;ent law, you mu&s;t aver, that both your
patent under the broad &s;eal and the act of parliament, which &s;ettle and
confirm that e&s;tate upon the Queen, during her life, are upon record
in the regi&s;ters of the crown-office and of the parliament, to which we
appeal: and that the Queens of England, independently of the King,
have a right to their e&s;tates &s;o &s;ettled upon them, the plenipotentiaries
of the prince of Orange them&s;elves, cannot be &s;o ignorant or &s;o wilful,
as to deny. Though her Maje&s;ty has an equal right to the arrears, which
being a ju&s;t debt, ought to be paid upon demand, as well as to the rent,
which &s;hall hence forward become due; yet, if the difficulty of paying
&s;o great a &s;um, all at once, &s;hould frighten them from doing her ju&s;tice
therein, a temperament may be propo&s;ed for paying the arrear by &s;o
much a year, as &s;hall be agreed upon, till the debt be all di&s;charged.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Additional In&s;tructions.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;1&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, D N. vol. ii. 4to. No. 44.</NOTE> IT is de&s;ired, that upon the conclu&s;ion of the peace, a general
indemnity may be obtained for all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, that have
been in his &s;ervice, &s;ince the revolution, both as to their per&s;ons and
to their e&s;tates, &s;ince &s;uch amne&s;ties never have been omitted or refu&s;ed
in treaties of a general peace, in relation to forfeitures incurred, during
and by rea&s;on of the war, as may be &s;een by the We&s;tphalia and Pyre|nean
treaties, where even tho&s;e, who had born arms again&s;t their lawful
&s;overeigns, were indemnified; and this is much more rea&s;onable and
ju&s;t, in the ca&s;e of his Maj$&s;ty's &s;ubjects, &s;ince all parties agree, that he
was their lawful king, when they fir&s;t bore arms and followed him.</P>
<P><PB N="564" REF="592">
2dly, If this demand, though rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, &s;hould meet with
difficulties not to be overcome, it is de&s;ired, at lea&s;t, that &s;uch as are
dome&s;tic and menial &s;ervants to the King and to the Queen, may enjoy
&s;uch indemnity as is above mentioned. For, I believe, his greate&s;t
enemies will not think it ju&s;t and decent, that their Maje&s;ties &s;hould live
without &s;ervants, and without tho&s;e of their own country, that have long
&s;erved them, which barbarity would be a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, from
the refu&s;ing &s;uch indemnity; at lea&s;t, the refu&s;ers thereof contribute,
as much as lies in them, to deprive their Maje&s;ties even of &s;ervants, by
making it &s;o highly penal, to &s;erve their per&s;ons even for tho&s;e who have
been &s;o long in their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>3dly, But, &s;hould this demand al&s;o find an unrea&s;onable and ob&s;tinate
oppo&s;ition, which certainly would a&s;toni&s;h the whole world, let it, at
lea&s;t, be endeavoured, that, &s;ince her Maje&s;ty, in her own per&s;on, lyes
under no forfeiture or di&s;ability, even by any law made &s;ince the revo|lution,
tho&s;e &s;ervants that are of her family may not be treated as cri|minals
of &s;tate, again&s;t whom no other guilt can be pretended or proved,
but &s;erving their Queen and mi&s;tre&s;s, and not leaving her in her adver|&s;ity.
It will appear in the eyes of the world very &s;trange, to make that
a crime &s;o highly puni&s;hable, e&s;pecially, &s;ince the prince Orange him&s;elf,
when he fir&s;t came into England, gave leave and pa&s;&s;ports to the Queen's
&s;ervants to follow her Maje&s;ty into France; and, for their &s;o doing and for
nothing el&s;e, they have been indicted of high trea&s;on, upon a general ac|cu&s;ation
of adhering to the King's enemies; nothing el&s;e being &s;worn
again&s;t them, at the finding of the bill, but that they were at St.
Germains; and for not coming out of France into England and appear|ing
to an&s;wer the indictment, within the time limited, they were out|lawed;
though, at the &s;ame time, there was a law in being, which did
prohibit, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, all pa&s;&s;ing out of France into
England.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;AS his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to obtain, by his
mediation, a promi&s;e from the prince of Orange, that the Queen
of England &s;hall be paid what is due to her, we are per&s;uaded, that his
Maje&s;ty will be &s;orry that &s;he &s;hould be deprived of it; and, as we have
too much rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the prince of Orange's &s;incerity, it will not
be difficult for him to invent quirks for eluding his promi&s;e. For in|&s;tance,
if the Queen is de&s;ired to &s;ign the di&s;charges, they may be drawn
up in &s;uch a form, that &s;he will not and cannot &s;ign them.</P>
<P>Again, if officers named by the Queen, are put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her
e&s;tates, and if the tenants and others refu&s;e to pay, they cannot be forced
but in a court of ju&s;tice; and the Queen will neither plead before their
courts nor acknowledge them, Be&s;ides that, the prince of Orange
might think him&s;elf freed from his promi&s;e, when he plea&s;ed, from a
pretence, that the money was employed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>So that there is no expedient, but that the prince of Orange &s;hould
oblige him&s;elf, by a &s;ecret article, to pay the &s;um mentioned to his mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, during the life of the Queen. If
the prince of Orange acts &s;incerely, he will accept this propo&s;al. If it
is rejected, the affair, in all likelihood, will be of no con&s;equence;
and yet there is no doubt, but his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty is very careful

been promi&s;ed at Ry&s;wick, and &s;ince, according to the fir&s;t &s;ettlement
it &s;hould be paid at quarterly terms, of which Chri&s;tmas is one, it is

be mo&s;t expedient for their relief and protection; that bi&s;hop being a
per&s;on of great prudence and experience, and knowing well that, at this
time, the intere&s;ts of France and of religion are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>5thly, It would be agreeable that endeavours &s;hould be made to
obtain a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the penal laws again&s;t Catholics, as well in Scot|land
and in Ireland, as in England, where they have &s;hewn &s;ome &s;ort of
moderation for &s;ome years. But in Scotland, their laws are executed
with rigour, by impri&s;oning and bani&s;hing all prie&s;ts, merely becau&s;e
they are prie&s;ts; and in Ireland, the great &s;everity of the new laws pa&s;&s;ed
there, gives rea&s;on to fear the &s;ame rigour in their execution.</P>
<P>6thly, Al&s;o all the King's friends who are ordinarily called Jacobites,

<P>&startq;AS we have looked on our people as our children, even with a hearty
and &s;incere de&s;ire of retaining the di&s;obedient, we have always reck|oned
<PB N="570" REF="598">
the &s;ufferings of the dutiful among the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of our aff$ic|tions;
and we had nothing more in view by our con&s;tant endeavours to
recover our right, than to have rewarded tho&s;e who had contributed
to it.</P>
<P>The misfortune that happened to the French fleet at La Hogue in
1692, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on that court, that ever &s;ince, the dif|$$$ulty
of tran&s;porting a con&s;iderable force was thought to be in&s;uperable;
and, therefore, from that time, applications were made to all the neu|tral
nations to &s;et a treaty of peace a foot, as may appear, by the date
of their memorials given to the northern crowns; and they were the more
&s;olicitous in pur&s;uing that de&s;ign the year following, by rea&s;on of the
famine and mortality that happened in their country, which &s;topt even
the circulation of the money; &s;o that nothing prevented the conclu&s;ion
of the peace then, but that there were &s;till means left to &s;upport the
Prince of Orange's aver&s;ion to it, which we made u&s;e of, among&s;t other
arguments, to engage them to attempt our re&s;toration, as being the
&s;horte&s;t way of obtaining an honourable and la&s;ting peace. But the tide
turned. France recovered, and the confederacy declined; &s;o that they
hoped to compa&s;s their purpo&s;e without venturing any thing. The con|jecture
was &s;o &s;ingularly unlucky, that our enemies' di&s;advantages advanced
this peace. Had Namur been relieved, we cannot doubt but it would
have been concluded the winter following; &s;ince we &s;ee, that the &s;epa|rate
treaty with Savoy has produced that effect, which certainly gave the
French all the advantage imaginable over their enemies.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when we were convinced that nothing could divert them from
their peaceable re&s;olution, and that the treaty was actually begun by
M. de Calliere, our only care then was the pre&s;ervation of our loyal
&s;ubjects; and, in order to that, in October, 1696, we in&s;i&s;ted earne&s;tly
that there might be an indemnity &s;tipulated for all tho&s;e who had ren|dered
them&s;elves obnoxious on our account: That all outlawries again&s;t
them might be rever&s;ed; and they re&s;tored to the full and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of their e&s;tates.</P>
<P>This was frequently reiterated with all the proper arguments and un|deniable
precedents, both to the French court and to that of Rome; that
by the la&s;t, it might be conveyed to all the catholic princes and &s;tates.
<PB N="571" REF="599">
It was propo&s;ed at Ry&s;wick by the French, but rejected by the Engli&s;h.
The fear of embara&s;&s;ing their own treaty, and left the &s;ame favour might
be pre&s;&s;ed for the Huguenots, were the rea&s;ons why it was not further
in&s;i&s;ted on by the French.</P>
<P>We cannot &s;uppo&s;e that any of our good &s;ubjects can harbour &s;uch di&s;|re&s;pectful
thoughts of us as to imagine that we were con&s;enting to this
peace. If any have &s;uch, we pity them, as the ravings of di&s;tempered
people; and, without doubt, will be &s;et right by reading our prote|&s;tation.</P>
<P>There is nothing we de&s;ire more than the quiet and &s;afety of our good
&s;ubjects: But every man mu&s;t con&s;ult him&s;elf in that point. If they do
what we cannot allow of, we would not have them think that they have
incurred our di&s;plea&s;ure thereby. We can freely pardon what we cannot
approve. We cannot con&s;ent to the taking of an unlawful oath in con|&s;cience;
be&s;ides, it would look like ab&s;olving them of their allegiance to
us, which might be interpreted an abdication. We have a &s;en&s;ible com|pa&s;&s;ion
of the pre&s;&s;ures they he under, and &s;hall &s;till depend on their &s;er|vice,
when we have occa&s;ion for it.&endq;</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>&startq;SIR,</SALUTE>
St. Germains, <DATE>January 16, 1698.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;MR. Berkenhead writes to me from Calais, that one Hunt, whom
he brought here, as you know, is re&s;olved to go back to Eng|land,
and to recommend him&s;elf, at the expence of all tho&s;e who came
over to France during the war; and, among the re&s;t, lord Ayle&s;bury
will undoubtedly be beheaded. Again&s;t &s;o great an evil there is no re|medy,
unle&s;s the King will be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;end him &s;ilently to
the Antilles, St. Domingo, or Canada, with an order to the governors
to confine him; and by this means, if he is demanded, it may be an|&s;wered
with truth, that he is not in France. The evil is immediate;
and, therefore, the King of England be&s;eeches you to repre&s;ent this to
the King, and to let him know his Maje&s;ty's intentions.&endq;</P>
<P>The earl of Middleton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> in a letter to the marquis de Torcy, on the
19th, de&s;ires that the &s;ame precautions &s;hould be taken again&s;t a Mr.
Goodman, who had been an evidence again&s;t &s;everal in England; and,
particularly, had informed again&s;t the duke of Powis, who, however,
bribed him to retire to France. Goodman now &s;eemed impatient to
return. Middleton &s;u&s;pected that his intention was to put him&s;elf under
the protection of the earl of Portland, when he arrived; and therefore,
in his ma&s;ter's name, de&s;ires he &s;hould be &s;ecured with Hunt. It ap|pears,
from another letter to de Torcy, written &s;ome months later, that
Goodman was &s;ent a pri&s;oner to Dauphiny, where his wife, in a petition
to the Queen, de&s;ired to be impri&s;oned with him. Middleton, in the
meantime, endeavoured to renew his former corre&s;pondence with &s;ome
of his friends in England. There is a letter from him of the 16th of
February, to Clelland (Waugh) containing general expre&s;&s;ions of kind|ne&s;s
and regard. He was then greatly alarmed that &s;ome letters of con|&s;equence
might be found about Mr. Cro&s;by, who had been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated
in the &s;treets of Paris. Cro&s;by had carried on a corre&s;pondence, for
&s;ome time, with James's &s;ecret friends in England, and Middleton was
<PB N="574" REF="602">
afraid that he might have had letters about him which would involve
many in troubles, if they fell into improper hands.</P>
<P>The clergy and people of Ireland pre&s;ented a memorial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nair$e's papers, D. N. vol. i. 4$o. No. 11.</NOTE> this year, to
a congregation at Rome, complaining that the Catholic princes had con|cluded
a peace, without making any &s;tipulation for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Catho|lics
of Ireland, England, and Scotland, and without con&s;ulting the Holy
See. They intimated their &s;u&s;picions, that the intrigues of the prince of
Orange extended to the court of Rome it&s;elf. They had undergone, they
&s;aid, a &s;evere per&s;ecution for upwards of one hundred and &s;eventy years.
They were now laughed at by the prote&s;tants, when they &s;aw them aban|doned
by tho&s;e from whom they expected protection. They enumerated
the &s;everal laws which were enacted again&s;t them, and which mu&s;t, in the
end, extirpate the Catholic religion. They humbly propo&s;ed to the
Pope to &s;end legates to the courts of all the Catholic princes, in order
to per&s;uade tho&s;e princes to forbid all commerce with Great Britain, un|til
the Catholics in the three kingdoms were freed from all re&s;trictions in
the exerci&s;e of their religion.</P>
<P>The Pope wrote a con&s;olatory letter to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 15.</NOTE> exhorting them to pa|tience
and per&s;everance, and promi&s;ing them the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his fervent
prayers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 14.</NOTE> At the &s;ame time he wrote a letter in their favour to the Em|peror.
It does not appear, that his imperial Maje&s;ty, in con&s;equence of
this letter, made any repre&s;entations to the court of Great Britain. But
before he received it, he mu&s;t have &s;ent in&s;tructions to his envoy at
London; for the Pope's letter is dated the 21&s;t of June, and the follow|ing
letter from the envoy to the Pope's nuncio is dated the 9th of May.
It appears from it, that he had received in&s;tructions from the Emperor
to make repre&s;entations to King William, in favour of the Roman Ca|tholics
in Ireland, and obtained his Maje&s;ty's promi&s;e that the penal
laws lately enacted again&s;t them &s;hould not be rigorou&s;ly executed.</P>

<P>&startq;ALTHOUGH I have not done my&s;elf the honour of writing to you
for &s;ome time, I have not, however, forgot my promi&s;e to ac|quaint
you, when the opportunity offered, with every thing that hap|pened
here concerning the affairs of Ireland. I don't doubt, but you
have been informed of the laws, which have been pa&s;t during this &s;e&s;&s;ion
of parliament, again&s;t the Catholics, and particularly again&s;t monks,
bi&s;hops, and all tho&s;e who have any eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity. And as his
imperial Maje&s;ty, my augu&s;t ma&s;ter, has been informed of them, he has
been plea&s;ed to order me to &s;peak about them to his Britannic Maje&s;ty.
I did not fail to do &s;o, as well as I could, and to &s;uch purpo&s;e, that his
Maje&s;ty &s;ent ye&s;terday the chancellor of that kingdom to me, to tell me,
that it is true the&s;e laws were pa&s;t, but that they would not be rigorou&s;ly
executed: that all the monks would not be bani&s;hed, although it was
almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to tolerate them longer, on account of their great in|&s;olence,
and their little re&s;pect for the pre&s;ent government. Yet &s;ome of
them would be allowed to remain, particularly tho&s;e, who, on account
of their great age, were incapable of leaving the kingdom. That all
the bi&s;hops and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignitaries would be allowed to re|main;
and that the Catholics might have as many &s;ecular prie&s;ts as
they plea&s;ed, in towns, as well as in villages and other places. As com|plaints
were made, that the capitulation of Limerick was not kept, the
chancellor explained this to me in &s;uch a manner, that I don't &s;ee there
is any rea&s;on to complain. I was informed likewi&s;e, that the parliament
had pa&s;&s;ed a law, by which all the Catholics were obliged to educate
their children in the pretended reformed religion. But the truth is, that
they did not even think of &s;uch a law. The que&s;tion now is, to
&s;ee that all, that hath been promi&s;ed to me, &s;hall be punctually per|formed.
I &s;hall take care of this. At the &s;ame time, the Catholics mu&s;t
behave in &s;uch a way as will enable me to be of &s;ervice to them. I was
willing to communicate this to you, in order to &s;hew you, that no oppor|tunity
<PB N="576" REF="604">
is neglected of maintaining our holy religion. I entreat you, mo&s;t
humbly, to be per&s;uaded, that I am, &amp;c.&endq;</P>
<P>The court of Rome di&s;puted with James the power of nominating
bi&s;hops in Ireland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. i. 410. No. 19, 21, 22, 23, 27.</NOTE> His agent, M. Caprara, pre&s;ented two memorials,
on the &s;ubject, to the propaganda. The bi&s;hop of Limerick gave in his
objections; and James was obliged to defend him&s;elf in a long and laboured
reply. Notwith&s;tanding the enthu&s;ia&s;m of this prince, and his &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive
obedience to the &s;ee of Rome in &s;pirituals, it appears, that he never
intended to acknowledge the Pope's &s;upremacy in temporal concerns.
The Iri&s;h bi&s;hops were &s;en&s;ible of this, and, though he had lo&s;t his
crowns for his attachment to their religion, they told him plainly that he
was under <HI>a &s;entence of excommunication;</HI> and that he mu&s;t be publickly
ab&s;olved, before he could interfere in their affairs. Their rea&s;onings to
prove this are no le&s;s curious, than the ab&s;urdity of their preten&s;ions.
They are contained in the following paper, entituled,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>&startq;How to treat with the Pope.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 18.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>&startq;WE mu&s;t lay, for an undoubted foundation, that the Pope will do
nothing, but according to the canons.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Therefore, it is in vain to treat with the Pope, unle&s;s we re&s;olve to be
guided by them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is certain, that England was heretofore excommunicated, according
to the canons; and the kingdom lies, at this day, under the excommu|nication.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So, no Engli&s;hman can, by the canons, appear as a public per&s;on, in
name of the community, till the excommunication is taken off.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For, although many Engli&s;h Catholics are, by &s;pecial privileges, ab|&s;olved
in particular; yet the ab&s;olution &s;erves not to make them capable
to deal, as public per&s;ons, with his Holine&s;s. But they mu&s;t be pub|lickly
ab&s;olved, among&s;t the re&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Therefore, the public excommunication mu&s;t be taken off, before the
kingdom can be capable of treating publickly with his Holine&s;s; and it
is his Holine&s;s alone that can take it off.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="577" REF="605">
&startq;Which being &s;o, the King ought to look upon the Pope as his &s;uperior,
and upon him&s;elf as a per&s;on not yet lawfully qualified to treat pub|lickly
with his Holine&s;s; who is, therefore, to be privately demanded
what the canons require &s;hould be done in this ca&s;e, until the whole
kingdom may be di&s;po&s;ed to receive a public &s;olemn ab&s;olution.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In my judgment, this ought to have been done before the crown was
&s;et upon his Maje&s;ty's head: and now, that very ceremony ought to be
brought into con&s;ideration, to the end that the &s;ubject may, for the fu|ture,
live under a catholic crown.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No doubt, but the Pope will be forwarder to grant, than we to de|mand,
as long as we keep within the bounds of the holy canons.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If we &s;werve from them, we cannot expect the Pope &s;hould be other|wi&s;e
than hard, unea&s;y, inflexible.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;YESTERDAY, the 16th of November, a porter came two or three
times in the morning, de&s;iring very earne&s;tly to &s;peak to me. At
la&s;t, between 11 and 12, he brought me a note, which I &s;ent to her Ma|je&s;ty
by Mr. Innes, the chaplain, who is acquainted with this affair. The
bearer of the note told me, that he had the &s;tricte&s;t orders from the per|&s;on
who &s;ent it, not to permit any other to &s;ee it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I went immediately to the per&s;on, who had written the note to me. I
found him in a little dark room, in the publick-hou&s;e called The prince
of Wales, and &s;aw a young man, whom I recollected to have known, but
of whom I had a very imperfect remembrance. He told me, that his
name was Charras; that he was brother to the apothecary of the &s;ame
name, at St. Marget's-&s;treet, near the abbey of St. Germains, at Paris.
After &s;ome compliments, he told me, that he had an affair of great con|&s;equence
to communicate to me, which required great &s;ecrecy: that he
had an expedient of rendering an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the King, our ma&s;|ter:
that, although he was a &s;tranger to his Maje&s;ty, he had an entire
affection for him: that he had always lamented the inju&s;tice which had
been done him: that he was determined to &s;urmount all the difficulties
which might occur: that he had only two or three friends; and that
the&s;e were dome&s;tics of the prince of Orange's, but devoted to the inte|re&s;ts
of King James: that a number of accomplices would render an en|terprize
of that kind always hazardous; and that the la&s;t affair failed,
merely becau&s;e too many were acquainted with it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All his expre&s;&s;ions indicated, that he cared little for his life, pro|viding
the King might be re&s;tored. He enlarged upon the &s;ubject; and
was willing, I imagine, to di&s;cover to me the expedient, which he men|tioned.
But I a&s;&s;ured him, that the King, my ma&s;ter, had principles of
religion and honour, which would never permit him to countenance &s;uch
an attempt. This an&s;wer embarra&s;&s;ed and &s;eemed to confound him; but,
recovering him&s;elf, he enlarged upon the recompen&s;e, which &s;uch an
heroic action would de&s;erve; and ob&s;erved, that, although he and his
<PB N="580" REF="608">
comrades &s;hould peri&s;h in the attempt, the action would be always rec|koned
glorious, and that the advantages, which their relations might
derive from it, would be a &s;ufficient recompen&s;e for the lo&s;s of their
lives.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He told me al&s;o, that he had communicated this affair to Mr. Innes,
which I now find to be fal&s;e; and that Mr. Innes de&s;ired him to come
to me. He a&s;&s;ured me al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, that he would make it
known to one or both of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. But, as &s;oon as I came
home, I &s;aw from the window of my room, that he left the inn, being
di&s;&s;atisfied, as I imagine, with my an&s;wers; and concluded, that I would

<P>&startq;I Have &s;o full and &s;o good an an&s;wer to give you from Mr. Mons, that
your heart cannot think or wi&s;h for a better. But how to do it, with|out
the key [the cypher] of the cabinet where the papers lie, is impo&s;|&s;ible.
Wherefore, upon receipt of this, &s;end me the key. I am very

&s;ince the people he has to do with are in a full di&s;po&s;ition to take advice.
Do not you think, that the credit of our trade will increa&s;e every day,
when it evidently will appear, that we go upon fair and ju&s;t things, and
will be a motive to good men to deal more freely with us; and the

John Murey [the King] is fully re&s;olved to give all the &s;atisfaction to his

In the mean time, it is de&s;ired from his friends, that may be in or

relative to the &s;ale of lands [the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion] at all. But, if they

<P>&startq;I Received yours of the 24th October,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, vol. viii. 4to. No. 1.</NOTE> which was our 6th of November,
with one inclo&s;ed from the colonel; to which I give you the trouble
to give him the inclo&s;ed, for an&s;wer, which I &s;hould have done, by the
la&s;t po&s;t, but could not by rea&s;on of a meeting I had with &s;ome friends,
which took up all my time for that day. I am very &s;en&s;ible of that
gentleman's good intentions to do us all the good he can, and I believe he
will do me that ju&s;tice to &s;ay, I was always &s;o from the fir&s;t day I had the
honour to know him; and, by what I &s;ay from Mr. Mons, he will &s;ee
how much he thinks he is obliged to him. If you have received all
mine of the 3d in&s;tant, you will perfectly &s;ee, that John Murey [the
King] does not intend that words, but deeds, &s;hould convince both his
friends and his enemies: for, as he re&s;erves nothing in his own power, they
have nobody but them&s;elves to blame, if every thing be not done to their
contentment; and, if that cannot do, you know the proverb, &startq;You can
have no more of the cat but the &s;kin.&endq; However, if there be any thing
to be expected from his creditors [the people], he is very de&s;irous to give
a meeting to any one, that will come from them, and he does not doubt,
but to give them all the &s;atisfaction they can expect; and if the thing be
rightly under&s;tood, they mu&s;t &s;ee the great advantages, that is upon their
&s;ide. Whereas, he has nothing before his eyes, but to have every thing,
by arbitrement of the arbitrators [parliament], di&s;po&s;ed of to the be&s;t ad|vantage
of his creditors [people]; and nobody can imagine, but the
longer it is delayed, the greater will be their lo&s;s. For, if the &s;ale of
<PB N="583" REF="611">
lands [&s;ucce&s;&s;ion] be neglected, you will allow the lo&s;s will every day be
the more. Therefore, let me entreat you to pre&s;s the having all the&s;e
things taken into con&s;ideration.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As for news, you had the contents of the King of Spain's will in the
la&s;t Paris Gazette, viz. The duke of Anjou is named to the entire &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of the whole monarchy, failing him the duke de Berry, and fail|ing
him the archduke, &s;econd &s;on to the Emperor, and after him the
duke of Savoy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The bees [city] you mention have been and are &s;till very trouble&s;ome,
and that you will &s;ee confounds all and makes us de&s;pair of all the re&s;t,
when &s;o little a thing cannot be removed. So that all I can &s;ay is, that,
if you could get the bees [city] recommended by the worthies you men|tion
in yours as injurious to them, in the pre&s;ent conjuncture, and that,
at &s;uch a time, when they are &s;etting up for good management, every thing
&s;hould appear by actions, as the parting with &s;uch as have wa&s;ted by
their profu&s;ene&s;s, and de&s;troyed by their councils all the improvements
that might have been made: that it is not agreeable with good manage|ment
to put &s;trangers over a family, that reckons they have wi&s;er people
of their own. The olde&s;t of the bees [city] is &s;upported by nothing
now, but the &s;hame of acknowledging a fault, and it's he only that &s;up|ports
the re&s;t; and in&s;tructions upon that, from the&s;e people, would be
well taken, but from no other, &s;hewing them, that per&s;evering in bad
things is the greate&s;t fault, and coming out of it makes the greate&s;t
amends that can be for any fault: that, whil&s;t they think to cover it, by
their per&s;everance, the meane&s;t capacities of their &s;ervants &s;ee it, and con|&s;equently
de&s;pi&s;e them for it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Since I begun to write this letter, I have got yours of the 28th, and
I thank you for the account you give me of that worthle&s;s fellow. I am
&s;atisfied of the truth of it; for the&s;e letters have been &s;hewn on this &s;ide,
as well as on yours; and yet for all that, and all we could &s;ay of the
affront and injury done to the per&s;on of honour, which Mr. Mons repre|&s;ented
very warmly, the M. i. i. f. c. y. and his gang carried it, and he
was ju&s;tified. If that gentleman knew what Mr. Mons &s;aid upon that
head, he would be well plea&s;ed; but he was an&s;wered, that it was other|wi&s;e:
that, far from doing him prejudice, he had &s;erved him. In a word,
<PB N="584" REF="612">
he has qualified him&s;elf to be thought capable of &s;erving what I am &s;atis|fied
he &s;ets up for; and he certainly was &s;ent thither for that end.&endq;</P>
<P>It is probable, that &s;ome of tho&s;e members, in both hou&s;es of parlia|ment,
who moved for the &s;evere addre&s;&s;es to King William, on the
treaties of partition, in March 1701, were acquainted with the &s;enti|ments
of the court of St. Germains, on the &s;ubject of the Spani&s;h &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion;

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATE>24 November, 1700.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;IN my la&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, vol. viii. 4to. No. 1.</NOTE> I gave you the account of the King of Spain's death, and
that the entire &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the&s;e great dominions were given to the
duke of Anjou, &amp;c. and now what may be the con&s;equence of it, is, at
pre&s;ent, the great &s;ubject of our di&s;cour&s;e and rea&s;oning. The French
reckon them&s;elves much obliged to the league they lately made with
Holland and England; and, indeed, &s;o they may: for that, and that
only, has put a con&s;traint upon Spain to put a&s;ide the arch-duke; &s;eeing
them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity either to do that or have their dominions
torn in pieces by the partage. I long extremely to hear how this will
be taken by the parliament, and by the wi&s;e people of England. For
here was a league made, without advi&s;ing and con&s;ulting them upon the
matter, and certainly very much to the prejudice of trade and intere&s;t
of the nation, which, no doubt, would have been examined into by the
parliament; and, indeed, if it was rea&s;onable to do it then, it is no
le&s;s rea&s;onable to do it now, upon what has happened. For, in all re|&s;pects,
this &s;ettlement has, at lea&s;t, as bad an a&s;pect towards England,
as the other. Humanly &s;peaking, here is a friend&s;hip betwixt the two
crowns of Spain and France for fifty years, taking in a grandfather, a
father, and a brother's friend&s;hip to a King of their own &s;etting up. What
trade can England propo&s;e to have in the Mediterranean, and in all the
Spani&s;h dominions, if France vie with them for it, though there be no
war; and if there be, how can they maintain a fleet, without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of the Spani&s;h ports and harbours? And it is evident; that this,
and whatever wor&s;e con&s;equences may ari&s;e from it, it is this triple
league that is the occa&s;ion; &s;ince it brought them upon the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="585" REF="613">
before mentioned. The duke of Bavaria has writ to the King of Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.&mdash;Dec.</NOTE>
and the general of their forces in the Netherlands will be at Ver&s;ailles
the morrow: &s;o that you fee here Flanders con&s;enting already; and in
what a condition would the Hollanders be, though Spain never made
war upon them, but only were, in ca&s;e of a war betwixt France and
them, con&s;enting to their troops marching through Flanders? And what
would become of that bulwark which England and Holland have for|merly
thought their intere&s;t to maintain, though at their own charges,
and which, in all appearance, is now lo&s;t by a league of their own mak|ing
with the King of France? Doctor Davenant will not need burn
his book again&s;t the league, but add an appendix, to &s;how that it has
had the &s;ame evil con&s;equences, or rather wor&s;e, than it could have had,
if all things had flood as they were when it was made, and the exe|cution
been made accordingly.&endq;</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
Wedne&s;day, <DATE>1&s;t of December, 1700.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I Have yours of the 14th of November,<NOTE PLACE="marg">December.</NOTE> O. S, and I am &s;orry you
had then &s;o little time to write;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, vol. viii. 4to. No. 1.</NOTE> for there are two things I hoped to
have had from you. One was the account of the Scotch parliament;
the other, how you rea&s;on upon this great affair of the Spani&s;h &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
whereof you had my opinion, upon the 24th of November,
N. S. Of both, I hope to have &s;omething from you by the next.
As to the Scotch parliament, by other letters, I am glad to find all goes
for the court. You know my opinion as to John Murey's [the King's]
affairs, is the &s;ame with yours; and yet, if it were po&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade
people to accept of what he offers, it would bring every thing into the
&s;ame channel that we propo&s;e it to run in, by a more natural way than all
other overtures can make it; and, by this method too, you &s;ee he does
not de&s;ire to be milled: for he gives all out of his own hands, But
this is an argument that I would not have you make u&s;e of with the
colonel; and yet it is the be&s;t thing could happen, both for him and his
friends. But all propo&s;itions any other way, in our parts, that is down|right,
will be to no purpo&s;e; and yet, upon your &s;ide of the water,
they would naturally of them&s;elves con&s;ider this and pre&s;s it, where there
is occa&s;ion. The bees [city] are a dead weight upon them, and look
more like a judgment than any thing el&s;e; they being an abomination
<PB N="586" REF="614">
to all the re&s;t of mankind but them&s;elves; and this ca&s;e truly &s;tated, by
the colonel's friends, would be of great u&s;e for them and us too, and I
am per&s;uaded they &s;uffer, at lead, as much by them as we do.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, the Dutch amba&s;&s;ador was at Ver&s;ailles, to demand an
audience of the King, and was refu&s;ed. It is &s;aid the King of France
&s;hould &s;ay, that, when he had his audience of the King of Spain, he
&s;hould have it of him. Whether he &s;aid this or not, I cannot be po|&s;itive.
But it is certain he was refu&s;ed, and that to the &s;eeing of as
many as were about the King's apartments at the mo&s;t public time of
the day; and, it is believed, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador will be &s;erved ju&s;t
&s;o. Thus, you &s;ee what that &s;ecret treaty is like to bring us to. How
&s;ea&s;onable it may be to think upon John Murey's [the King's] propo|&s;ition,
I leave you to judge.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
Wedne&s;day, <DATE>8th of December, 1700.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I Have &s;een yours of the 27th of November;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, vol. viii. 4to. No. 1.</NOTE> and I am glad you are
got &s;afe to London. I find you are alarmed there with the duke of
Anjou being declared King of Spain, and, no doubt, you have rea|&s;on;
for the con&s;equences of it may be &s;till greater than your appre|hen&s;ions
of them are. It is not probable, that the duke of Bavaria will
remain long governor of Flanders, though he has &s;ent his compliments
to the King of Spain, and done all other marks of joy and acknowledg|ment
upon that &s;ubject. The general of the Spani&s;h forces in Flanders
was likewi&s;e with the King of Spain before he went from hence; and
was immediately &s;ent back, upon an expre&s;s from the duke of Bavaria,
upon &s;ome apprehen&s;ions they had of the Dutch garri&s;ons. It is certain
that the King of France a&s;ked the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador what their debt
was to the Dutch, for which they had the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e towns. He
an&s;wered, &s;ix million. Well, &s;ays the King, if the councils of Spain
think fit to free them&s;elves of the&s;e garri&s;ons, I will make good the
money. So that you &s;ee there is made good what you &s;eem in England
to fear, in the mo&s;t material part. Be&s;ides, the governor of the French
Flanders has orders to &s;end the duke of Bavaria or the Spani&s;h general
what troops they &s;hall demand, upon any occa&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>When I think upon the con&s;equences that this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to Spain may
produce, I cannot but reflect upon the means and in&s;truments that have
<PB N="587" REF="615">
been made u&s;e of to bring it about. To &s;ay, that England and Hol|land
&s;hould be the&s;e in&s;truments, is &s;trange, and yet certainly true. For
that &s;ecret treaty, made by the King of England and the Dutch with
France, has put the Spaniards upon a nece&s;&s;ity of doing for them&s;elves
the wi&s;e&s;t thing they ever did, calling the duke d'Anjou to be their King;
for nothing but this nece&s;&s;ity could have made them lay a&s;ide the
Au&s;trian family. They &s;aw, by this &s;ecret league, their territories di|vided,
their monarchy torn in pieces, a power &s;et up again&s;t them,
France, England, and Holland to make good their divi&s;ion, too &s;trong
for them and all they could expect to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; and &s;o, by giving it
to the duke of Anjou, humanly &s;peaking, they have &s;ecured to them|&s;elves
a peace with France for fifty years, entailed upon the life of a
grandfather, a father, and a brother, who will think it their glory to
maintain a &s;on of France in the&s;e great dominions; and it is not to be
doubted, but the children of his body will be as good Spaniards as ever
were before them; &s;o that Spain has acted a wi&s;e part.</P>
<P>It's dangerous for any &s;tate to be governed by a head that is no|tional;
for &s;uch are generally given to try experiments. What greater
&s;ecurity could England have, than in the Aug&s;burg league? Why was
not that renewed, which would have kept the kingdom in peace for
hundreds of years, in all probability? But this treaty, among&s;t other
things, has de&s;troyed the credit and friend&s;hip the Au&s;trian family can
have for our King hereafter. So that, by this <HI>tour de baton,</HI> he has lo&s;t
his new friends and his old ones together.</P>
<P>Your cou&s;in [the King] is very well. I never &s;aw &s;o great a change up|on
a man, in &s;o little time. I was with him, at Ver&s;ailles, when the King
of Spain parted; and I dare be bold to &s;ay, that, if you &s;ee him three
or four months hence, you will admire the alteration, with great joy.
My friend and his partner give you both their humble &s;ervice; and they
do not doubt but you will mind them upon occa&s;ion. I am,</P>

<P>&startq;THE King publickly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma$pher|&s;on's Ex|tracts. from the continu|ation of James the Second's memoirs, Scot's Col|lege.</NOTE> and by name, forgave all his enemies. He
had often declared, that he was more beholden to the prince of
Orange than to all the world be&s;ides. The King of France came to
wait upon him. He lighted at the ca&s;tle-gate, as others did, to prevent
the noi&s;e of coaches from di&s;turbing him. Ju&s;t before he expired, he
mentioned by name, with a loud voice, the prince of Orange, the
prince&s;s of Denmark, and the Emperor; and &s;aid he wi&s;hed they might
be acquainted that he forgave them all. The King of France, the third
time he came to fee the King, declared he would own the prince of Wales
King of England. He had he&s;itated long. The dauphin, the duke of
Burgundy, and all the. princes thought it unbecoming the dignity of
the crown of France, not to own the title of the prince of Wales, He

Engli&s;h, bur&s;t at once into tears, expre&s;&s;ive of a mixture of joy and
grief. Some threw them&s;elves at his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's feet. All
&s;eemed &s;o much affected, that the King of France him&s;elf bur&s;t into
tears. The King of England was endeavouring to &s;ay &s;omething. But
the confu&s;ed noi&s;e was &s;o great, and he &s;o weak, that he could not be
heard. The King of France went away. But as he pa&s;&s;ed, he called
the officer of the guard, and de&s;ired him to treat the prince of Wales as
King, whenever his father &s;hould expire.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The next day, the King was &s;omething better. The prince of Wales
was permitted to &s;ee him, which he was not often &s;uffered to do; it be|ing
ob&s;erved, that when he &s;aw him, it rai&s;ed &s;uch a commotion in him,
as was thought to do him harm. When he came into the room, the
King &s;tretching forth his arms to embrace him, &s;aid, &startq;I have not &s;een
you &s;ince his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty was here, and promi&s;ed to own you
when I &s;hould be dead. I have &s;ent my lord Middleton to Marly, to
thank him for it.&endq; He was taken next day with continual convul&s;ions
and &s;haking in his hands; and, on the day following, being the &s;ixteenth
of September, he expired.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He was &s;omething above the middle &s;tature, well-&s;haped, very nervous
and &s;trong. His face was rather long, his complexion fair, his coun|tenance
engaging. But his outward carriage was a little &s;tiff and con|&s;trained.
He was not &s;o gracious as he was courteous and obliging.
He was affable and of ea&s;y acce&s;s. He affected no formality, though
no one knew the ceremonial better, nor was more exact in the ob&s;erva|tion
of them when nece&s;&s;ary. In his conver&s;ation and arguing, he en|deavoured
rather to convince with good rea&s;on than fine expre&s;&s;ions;
and having &s;ome he&s;itation in his &s;peech, his di&s;cour&s;e was not &s;o grace|ful
as it was judicious and &s;olid. He abhorred the duplicity of a
refined courtier. He was an a&s;&s;ured friend, if he profe&s;&s;ed it; and
when he could not &s;erve a man, he let him in&s;tantly know it. His
temper was naturally hot and choleric. But, in his latter days, he got
the better of that; and, even in his younger days, it &s;eldom &s;o much
overpowered him, as to make him do any action unbecoming. Though
he was diffident of men, he was no le&s;s un&s;ucce&s;sful, when he reigned,
in detecting his enemies, than he had been, the mo&s;t part of his life, in
<PB N="591" REF="619">
choo&s;ing his friends. He was a great lover of walking and hunting.
But no diver&s;ion made him neglect bu&s;ine&s;s; to which he had &s;o great
an application, that it &s;eemed to be of the number of his diver&s;ions.
He was &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hiable for this, that, during his younger days, not|with&s;tanding
the un&s;ettledne&s;s of his condition, while he lived in exile,
he had not only performed his duty with great exactne&s;s, but kept an
account of all occurrences; and he has obliged po&s;terity with better me|morials
under his own hand, than perhaps any &s;overeign prince has been
known to leave behind him before.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He was, all his life, a great enemy to drinking, gaming, and indeed
to all diver&s;ions which commonly render men incapable of bu&s;ine&s;s.
He avoided always the lo&s;s of time, which he counted precious, and
ever managed with great circum&s;pection. Even women, of whom he
was fond, never induced him to neglect his bu&s;ine&s;s, run into extravagant
expence, or totally forgetful of his duty. He was a kind hu&s;band, notwith|&s;tanding
his love of women. His affection for the Queen was mixed
with a re&s;pect and deference. He was the be&s;t father in the world, and
the mo&s;t unfortunate in &s;ome of his children; the be&s;t ma&s;ter, yet the
wor&s;t &s;erved; a mo&s;t con&s;tant friend, yet never prince found fewer, in
his greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ities. He was &s;o fond of his children, in particular,
that when he found the prince&s;s of Denmark had de&s;erted him, upon
his return from Sali&s;bury, he only &s;eemed anxious about her health, and
fears for her mi&s;carriage.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;AS I have the honour of having been near thirteen years, in the
&s;ervice of the late King of Great Britain, James the Second, of
ble&s;&s;ed and holy memory, and having followed him, in that time, to
Ireland, La Hogue, and Calais, and of having been every where a wit|ne&s;s
of his holy life, particularly at St. Germains, where I had likewi&s;e
the misfortune to be pre&s;ent at his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s and death; it is &s;up|po&s;ed,
that, old as I am now, at the age of &s;eventy-nine years almo&s;t
<PB N="592" REF="620">
complete, I may be &s;till able to recollect &s;ome circum&s;tances of the life
of that prince. Accordingly, it is ju&s;t now intimated to me, that I &s;hall
be &s;ummoned one of the&s;e days, with &s;ome other old officers of his
Maje&s;ty's hou&s;hold, to give each of us, an authentic te&s;timony of his
life and manners; and I am advi&s;ed, at the &s;ame time, to put in writing,
for the &s;ake of greater exactne&s;s, whatever I can remember.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This then I am going to do, with all the &s;incerity I can, and as in
the pre&s;ence of God, before whom I mu&s;t appear being very &s;orry that
my memory (which was never very good, and which is le&s;s &s;o to-day
than ever) cannot &s;econd my zeal upon this occa&s;ion &s;o much as I
would choo&s;e. For the pre&s;ent King of Great Britain (in the &s;ervice
of whom, and of the late King, his father, I have the honour of hav|ing
pa&s;&s;ed upwards of forty-&s;ix years) knows, that it is on account of
my great age and of my infirmities, that he was plea&s;ed, la&s;t year, to
grant me permi&s;&s;ion to retire from his court at Rome, (where I was no
longer fit for bu&s;ine&s;s) and to come to fini&s;h my days in quietne&s;s in
France. But yet, notwith&s;tanding my want of capacity, I &s;hall obey
the orders, which have been intimated to me, as faithfully as I po&s;&s;ibly
can.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To begin, I can atte&s;t with truth, that I have always ob&s;erved, in King
James the Second, of happy memory, a great fund of goodne&s;s and re|ligion,
an upright mind, a good heart, a great regularity of life, a pater|nal
affection for all his loyal &s;ubjects and &s;ervants; and, above all, an
inviolable attachment to the holy &s;ee, and to the catholic, apo&s;tolic, and
Roman religion, to which he had already &s;acrificed his three crowns,
and was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice further his life, if nece&s;&s;ary, as he often
prote&s;ted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I atte&s;t, that during the re&s;idence of that prince at St. Germains, he
heard ordinarily two ma&s;&s;es every day, one in the morning, and another
towards noon. That he performed his devotions, on all the great fe&s;ti|vals,
and likewi&s;e on &s;everal other days of the year, and then heard, for
the mo&s;t part, three ma&s;&s;es; and if, on the&s;e days, there were ve&s;pers,
&s;ermon, and exaltation of the ho&s;t, at the pari&s;h church, or at the chapel
of the ca&s;tle, or the church of the Recoletts, he was there, and, in every
lent and advent, he had &s;ermon in his chapel thrice a week, and he
never failed to go there regularly, attended always by the Queen, his
<PB N="593" REF="621">
religious con&s;ort, who was likewi&s;e, as every one knows, an example of
piety. They went likewi&s;e together, every year, on foot, to the proce&s;|&s;ion
of the holy &s;acrament, with the pari&s;h, over all the town of St.
Germains. On the day and octave of Corpus Chri&s;ti, and at the return
of that long proce&s;&s;ion, they &s;taid to hear high ma&s;s, at the pari&s;h
church; and, on every evening, during the octave, they were pre&s;ent at
the exaltation of the ho&s;t; and, as there was &s;carcely a Sunday or a great
holy-day, during the year, but there was an exaltation at the pari&s;h
church, their Maje&s;ties were always pre&s;ent; and when there was no
e&s;tabli&s;hed fund for &s;aying ma&s;s, they ordered one to be &s;aid, which kept
up a great deal of devotion in the place, and edified every one.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In other re&s;pects, this pious prince &s;o divided his time, between the
duties of his &s;tation and tho&s;e of religion, that the one never interfered
with the other; and that all his hours were regulated, both for giving
audience to his mini&s;ters and others, and for &s;leeping, ri&s;ing, eating, and
walking, as well as for praying and pious reading and writing, in&s;omuch,
that he was remarkable for his great exactne&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He was very charitable; and, as there were a great many of his poor
faithful &s;ubjects, at St. Germains, who had lo&s;t their fortunes to follow
him, he was touched with their condition, and retrenched, as much as
he could, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. He u&s;ed to call, from time to time, into his
cabinet, &s;ome of the&s;e ba&s;hful, indigent per&s;ons, of all ranks, to whom
he di&s;tributed, folded up in &s;mall pieces of paper, five, ten, fifteen, or
twenty pi&s;toles, more or le&s;s, according to the merit, the quality, and the
exigency of each.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He charged &s;ome of his chaplains to take care, that none of his catho|lic
&s;ervants failed to perform their devotions regularly at Ea&s;ter; and, as
he was the milde&s;t and be&s;t of ma&s;ters, and loved all his &s;ervants and
de&s;ired their eternal happine&s;s, he lamented the misfortune of &s;uch of
them, as had been educated in the prote&s;tant religion, and through pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
or a fal&s;e point of honour or human con&s;iderations, per&s;i&s;ted
in it. He prayed to God, with all his heart, for their conver&s;ion, and
&s;ometimes, took occa&s;ion to exhort them, to think &s;eriou&s;ly of inquiring
whether they were in the true church or not, &s;ince upon that depended
their eternal &s;alvation; and he gave them &s;ometimes good books to
<PB N="594" REF="622">
read. But he always &s;poke to them with mildne&s;s and di&s;cretion, letting
them always under&s;tand, that he never meant to force the con&s;ciences of
his &s;ubjects; believing him&s;elf obliged to be a common father to all, in|dependently
of the differences of religion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He, as well as the late Queen, his con&s;ort, was much addicted to the
continual adoration of the ho&s;t, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the pari&s;h of St. Germain;
and for that purpo&s;e, he &s;et apart his hour and day of the year for going
after dinner to the pari&s;h church, to continue an entire hour in prayer and
meditation on his knees before the augu&s;t &s;acrament of our altars; a
devotion, to which the King, his &s;on, continues to be much addicted,
with the Queen, his con&s;ort.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He practi&s;ed, from time to time, &s;piritual retirements, for &s;even or
eight days, in &s;ome religious hou&s;e at Paris, from whence he went every
day incognito, with a few attendants, to vi&s;it churches and to be pre&s;ent
at &s;ermons, ma&s;&s;es, and &s;alues; and when it was Ea&s;ter-week, he went
to the pa&s;&s;ion &s;ermon and night offices. He was likewi&s;e three or four
times in retirement at La Trappe; one of which times I remember to
have been, as he was on his way to La Hogue. He &s;taid there u&s;ually
three days, practi&s;ing nearly the &s;ame ab&s;tinence with the monks, and
being pre&s;ent at a great part of their &s;ervice.&endq;</P>
<P>Nairne, having giving &s;everal particular in&s;tances, of James's con&s;tant
and unwearied attention to excite the &s;ame &s;pirit of devotion in others, proceeds to give an account of his &s;ickne&s;s and death.</P>
<P>&startq;I atte&s;t then, that, in this &s;ickne&s;s, he edified all tho&s;e who were
about him, as well prote&s;tants as catholics, by his great patience in his
&s;ufferings and by his perfect re&s;ignation to the holy will of God, as to
both life and death: that he confe&s;&s;ed and communicated more than
once, during his &s;ickne&s;s, and manife&s;ted always an extreme &s;orrow for
his pa&s;t &s;ins, and a &s;incere de&s;ign for continuing to do penance for them,
not only in this world, but al&s;o in purgatory, if it was the will of God;
for &s;o he explained him&s;elf.</P>
<P>That his great charity appeared, in this re&s;pect, that God gave himgrace
to forgive cordially all his enemies, and to pray for them; and, by name,
for the Emperor and even the prince of Orange, &s;aying aloud, that he was,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, obliged to his enemies for the mercy which he hoped
<PB N="595" REF="623">
God would &s;how him; becau&s;e, if he had remained on his throne and
continued always in pro&s;perity, he would not, perhaps, have ever thought
of the great work of his &s;alvation, as &s;eriou&s;ly and as efficaciou&s;ly as he
ought.</P>
<P>That his paternal affection for all his faithful &s;ubjects and &s;ervants,
who had followed him in his exile and remained con&s;tantly attached to
him, &s;eemed to redouble, in proportion as he drew near his end: &s;o
that it might be &s;aid of him, <HI>in finem dilexit eos.</HI> Accordingly, he re|commended
them all, in the &s;ame manner with his royal family, to the
protection of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, when his Maje&s;ty came to &s;ee
him in his &s;ickne&s;s; and he had the con&s;olation, before his death, to
know, from that great and generous Monarch's own mouth, that he
would acknowledge the prince of Wales, his &s;on, for King, as &s;oon as God
had di&s;po&s;ed of him. He &s;poke, in &s;hort, with &s;o much goodne&s;s, to the
principal noblemen of his court, when he &s;aw them about his bed, that
they were all tenderly affected by it, &s;eeing the zeal and real affection,
with which he &s;poke to them of God, and exhorted them to think of their
&s;alvation and of death and eternity.</P>
<P>Here, I imagine, I ought not to pa&s;s over, in &s;ilence, a fact, which is
public and which is very remarkable, viz. that the earl of Middleton,
&s;ecretary of &s;tate to his Britannick Maje&s;ty, who was then a prote&s;tant,
a man of polite learning and of great genius and capacity, as well as of
honour and loyalty to his lawful King, was one of tho&s;e, to whom his
Maje&s;ty had &s;poke of religion, on his death-bed. Now the con&s;equence
has &s;hown, that what his Maje&s;ty &s;aid to him then, on the &s;ubject, had
made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his mind. For a little time after the death
of the King, God, in mercy to that nobleman, touched his heart, in
&s;uch a manner, that, when it was lea&s;t expected, he retired, on a &s;udden,
to the Engli&s;h &s;eminary, at Paris; where, after having finally &s;atisfied
him&s;elf, in &s;ome doubts which remained with him concerning our reli|gion,
he abjured his own, and was received into the bo&s;om of the catho|lic,
apo&s;tolic, and Roman church, in which he always per&s;evered while
he lived and died a good and zealous catholic. Every one a&s;cribed this to
the prayers of the King, his ma&s;ter, and to the ble&s;&s;ing which God gave
to his exhortations to him before he died.</P>
<P><PB N="596" REF="624">
I atte&s;t, finally, that his Maje&s;ty, more than once, declared, on his
death-bed, that he died a &s;on of the catholic, apo&s;tolic, and Roman
church; and gave, to his la&s;t breath, inconte&s;tible proofs of the &s;trength
of his faith, of his inviolable attachment to the holy &s;ee, and to all the
truths of our holy religion, and of his filial obedience to our mo&s;t holy
father, the pope. In the&s;e truly catholic &s;entiments I have &s;een this
great prince die, after having received all the &s;acraments, with an exem|plary
devotion, and having edified all the beholders by his patience and hu|mility,
by his entirely detaching him&s;elf from this world, and by his ardent
love to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in who&s;e merits he placed all the foundation of
his hopes for eternity; and la&s;tly, by all the marks of a compunction,
the mo&s;t lively and mo&s;t &s;uitable to the contrite and humble heart of
a penitent and holy King.</P>
<P>Thus died, the real death of the righteous, and with a great repu|tation
of &s;anctity, James the Second of ble&s;&s;ed memory, King of Great
Britain, at the ca&s;tle of St. Germains, the &s;ixteenth of September, 1701,
after a &s;ickne&s;s of &s;everal days. His body was tran&s;ported, three or
four days thereafter, to Paris, and depo&s;ited in the church of the Eng|li&s;h
Benedictents, in the &s;uburbs of St. James, where the people of
Paris, convinced of the &s;anctity of this prince, and per&s;uaded that the
church would declare its opinion in this re&s;pect, at a proper time
and place, began immediately to revere his memory before-hand, and
to go in crowds to the church where his body was depo&s;ited, to
celebrate ma&s;&s;es and neuvaines, for a&s;king &s;everal favours of God,
through the interce&s;&s;ion of this good King. Accordingly, there is found,
to this day, in the regi&s;ters of that church, a particular account of &s;everal
miraculous cures, or &s;uch as appeared, at lea&s;t to be &s;o, wrought upon
&s;ick per&s;ons, through the interce&s;&s;ion, as was piou&s;ly believed, of this
holy King; and afterwards, of the ma&s;&s;es, which were &s;aid in that
church, agreeably to the intention of the&s;e per&s;ons. Among others, there
is an atte&s;tation, that my decea&s;ed wife had a neuvaine celebrated in that
church, for my &s;on, who was then about five years of age and troubled
with a rupture, of which he was cured, a little after the neuvaine was
fini&s;hed; and he has felt nothing of that inconveniency ever &s;ince, How|ever,
I atte&s;t nothing here but facts, as it does not become me to enter
into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of what is or is not miraculous. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that
<PB N="597" REF="625">
the public have con&s;idered, as a real miracle, the &s;udden and remark|able
cure of a fi&s;tula lachrymalis, wrought at that time, on the late
Mon&s;ieur Roquette, bi&s;hop of Autun, nephew to the famous Mr.
Bo&s;&s;uet, bi&s;hop of Meaux, after prayers addre&s;&s;ed to God by that prelate,
through the interce&s;&s;ion of our King. This fact may be verified &s;till,
by the authentic te&s;timonies of it, which are to this day pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the particulars which I can recall to my remembrance of
the later years of the life and al&s;o of the la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s and death of King
James the Second, of Great Britain, with regard to his life and morals,
I &s;hall only add, with regard to his Chri&s;tian &s;entiments, that I know
he has left, written in his own hand, inconte&s;tible proofs of his piety, in
many of his manu&s;cripts, of which I have &s;een, read, and copied a great
number. It is from the great confidence, which the two Kings, father
and &s;on, were plea&s;ed to place in me, that I am now able to atte&s;t &s;till
this la&s;t great proof, which is pre&s;erved, of the &s;olid piety of this great
and virtuous prince, who&s;e &s;oul, we have rea&s;on to hope, is now recom|pen&s;ed
a hundred fold in heaven, for the great inju&s;tice which was done
him on earth, and for the kind of martyrdom which he &s;uffered for the
faith.</P>
<P>In witne&s;s of the truth of all that is &s;aid above, I &s;ign this atte&s;tation,
at Paris, the third day of July, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirty|four;
after having received, this morning, a citation to appear, on the
fifth of this in&s;tant month of July, at the archbi&s;hopric, to make oath,
before the judges appointed to examine the witne&s;&s;es, &s;ummoned in the
cau&s;e of the decea&s;ed King of England, James the Second of ble&s;&s;ed me|mory,

The &s;uperior of the Carmalite&s;&s;es, in the Fauxbourg, St Jaques, at Paris, told him that the decea&s;ed King's fir&s;t miracle would be in his favour.

The &s;uperior of the Nuns of Chaillot invited him to &s;ay ma&s;s for the repo&s;e of the King's &s;oul, on the twenty-&s;ixth of September, and he found him&s;elf cured when he came out of the church. The bi&s;hop gave a minute account of all this in a long letter to the Queen, of which a copy, in Nairne's hand, is annexed to this extract.</P>
<P>2. Gilbert Marais, a &s;urgeon at St. Pourcain, in Auvergne, and brother to the cure of the pari&s;h, both natives of the place, was cured of a pal&s;y in both his legs, through the interce&s;&s;ion of the King of England, on the twenty eighth of October, 1701. The miracle is atte&s;ted by the cure, in a letter to the archbi&s;hop of Vienne, who inclo&s;ed the cure's letter, and a minute detail of all the particulars of the cu$e, &s;igned by the cur&eacute;, and by Gilbert Marais him&s;elf, in a letter to the &s;uperior of the nuns at Chaillot, to be communicated to the Queen. All the&s;e vouchers, in Nairne's hand, are annexed to the extract.</P>
<P>3. Pa&s;&s;art de la Rotte, King's coun&s;ellor in the &s;upreme court at Metz, was cured of a retention of urine, on the fifteenth of November, 1701. The particulars of the miracle, in Pa&s;&s;art's own atte&s;tation, annexed to the extract in Nairne's hand, are as follow: On the fifteenth of October, 1701, as he was &s;etting out from Paris on his return to Metz, Pa&s;&s;art was &s;eized with a retention of urine. He was bled eight times; he remained in great torment for eight day, and was a&s;&s;ured by the able&s;t phy&s;icians in Paris, whom he con&s;ulted, that though his life was in no danger, he could not be cured in five or &s;ix. weeks. He was alarmed at the pro&s;pect of remaining &s;o long in pain, and prayed to the decea&s;ed King for his interce&s;&s;ion, making a vow, that if he &s;hould be cured through the holy Monarch's interce&s;&s;ion, he would perform his devotions in the chapel where the body lay, the fir&s;t day he could go out. His prayer was heard, and the next day he per|formed his vow.</P>
<P>4. Philip Pitel, a Benedictine Monk, of the Abbacy of Beuilly, in the dioce&s;e of Tours, was cured of a &s;uffocating cough, on the &s;ixth of December, 1701. He was &s;eized with a &s;it of the cough as he went from his father's hou&s;e to the &s;orbonne, and lo&s;t all &s;en&s;a|tions in&s;tantaneou&s;ly. Bleeding, and the u&s;ual remedies, were tried in vain. A &s;welled throat for many days prevented him from taking any &s;u&s;tenance, and almo&s;t from breath|ing. In this di&s;tre&s;s, he felt a &s;udden and unaccountable impul&s;e to prefer the following prayer: &startq;O God, I be&s;eech thee, mercifully to cure me, and to grant me health, through the merits and interce&s;&s;ion of King James; and I promi&s;e to have a ma&s;s &s;aid, as a thank&s;giving, in the Benedictine church, where his corp&s;e lays, and to touch the mort-cloth, which covers it, with my tongue.&endq; The patient &s;oon felt a profu&s;e &s;weat breaking out over all his body, and in due time his recovery was completed. His own atte&s;tation of the&s;e particulars, &s;igned in the pre&s;ence of his confe&s;&s;or, the cur&eacute; of St. Sulpice, is in Nairne's hand, annexed to the extract.</P>
<P>5. Le Brun, a prie&s;t of the oratory, and profe&s;&s;or of theology and eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, atte&s;ts, that Catharine Dupr&egrave; was cured of deafne&s;s.</P>
<P>6. The prior and three monks of the Engli&s;h Benedictine Convent at Paris, with other two, &s;ign as witne&s;&s;es to the declaration of Francis L'Epervier, dancing-ma&s;ter to the duke of Saxe Gotha. L'Epervier declares that his wife was cured of a rheumati&s;m, by the interce&s;&s;ion of the decca&s;ed King; and her &s;urgeon and his apprentice, declare that they did not contribute to the cure. There are &s;ome other cures atte&s;ted in the &s;ame manner. The account, at length, of the miraculous cures wrought through the inter|ce&s;&s;ion of James, con&s;i&s;ts of thirteen quarto, and thirty-two folio pages, but as there are very few now a days who read the legends of &s;aints, or can reli&s;h compo&s;itions which re&s;emble tho&s;e of the tenth and eleventh centuries, it is &s;uppo&s;ed the reader will think the above a &s;ufficient &s;pecimen.</P></NOTE>.&endq;</CLOSER>

<P>THE editor intends from this period to contra&s;t the papers of the family
of Hannover with tho&s;e of the hou&s;e of Stuart. The corre&s;pondence
of the fir&s;t is not &s;o important in the early part of queen Anne's reign as it
became afterwards, when a near pro&s;pect of her death rendered them and
their friends anxious concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne. The
&s;ntrigues of the excluded family having langui&s;hed, during the la&s;t years of
the life of James the &s;econd, were not yet renewed with any degree of
indu&s;try under his &s;on. The adherents of the Stuarts were, however,
not entirely idle. Immediately upon the death of James, they began to
&s;ound &s;ome of tho&s;e who had made the greate&s;t profe&s;&s;ions, and now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
the mo&s;t power to &s;erve their cau&s;e. Among the&s;e were the earl
of Marlborough and the lord Godolphin, who renewed to the &s;on the a&s;|&s;urances
which they had made to the father. But the death of King
William, by bringing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne one &s;tep nearer to the
old &s;tock, cooled the zeal of the abettors of the hereditary de&s;cent of the
crown. In this &s;tate of affairs, the corre&s;pondences of the court of St.
Germains could not regain their former importance, though they con|tain
&s;everal anecdotes, as curious in them&s;elves as they are altogether
unknown. The Stuart-papers in the pre&s;ent year are prior in date to
tho&s;e of the family of Hannover, and therefore they are placed fir&s;t; an
order, which, for the &s;ake of regularity, &s;hall be ob&s;erved throughout
the collection.</P>

<P>&startq;IT &s;eems to me ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t to weigh well and con|&s;ider
the pre&s;ent temper England and Scotland are in, before any
ju&s;t judgment can be made of what is nece&s;&s;ary to be done, for uniting
the &s;everal intere&s;ts of the two nations to concur in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As for England the parties mo&s;t to be con&s;idered are;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the epi&s;copal, which being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bells is by far the
mo&s;t numerous, though not the mo&s;t active; for being at their ea&s;e and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing not only the tythes but the magi&s;tracy and profitable employ|ments
of the nation, they flatter them&s;elves with an opinion, that upon
any emergency or change of &s;tate, they &s;hall be able to give the law to
all other intere&s;ts. And it is not improbable they might, could they find
out a way to &s;ettle the crown upon any &s;olid ba&s;is. But that not being
po&s;&s;ible to be done but in the right line, that party rather &s;uffers than ap|proves
of what has been clone, by adding the hou&s;e of Hannover to their
weak and trembling intail, which, as it was the project only of the prince
of Orange and his Dutch council, is by many &s;u&s;pected, but de&s;pi&s;ed by
more, nor could have pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of commons, but that they were
<PB N="603" REF="631">
told it was the only way to expre&s;s a contempt of the power of France,
and by that means to make the people believe that they feared nothing
thence, and likewi&s;e to oblige that monarch to apprehend their power to
be much greater than indeed it is, to &s;tave off a war they more appre|hend
and dread them&s;elves than he needs to do, notwith&s;tanding all the
rabble and trading part of the nation are univer&s;ally for it.</P>
<P>The next party requires con&s;ideration is the Pre&s;byterian, which con|&s;i&s;ts
of a malicious, &s;ower, and &s;ubtle part of men, who are more united
in malice than the former, and do with their demure countenances and
out&s;ide pharazaical righteou&s;ne&s;s draw from the churches to their meet|ing
hou&s;es the mo&s;t hypocritical part of the trading people; &s;o that their
numbers are wonderfully increa&s;ed of late years, to the terror of the
a&s;piring part of the epi&s;copal par&s;ons, who dread that bi&s;hops, deans,
and chapters, are tumbling down again, knowing bare competencies too
weak &s;upports for their di&s;&s;olute and &s;candalous lives.</P>
<P>The next to be con&s;idered is the Independents, under which denomi|nation
may be included that rabble of divers &s;ects, which by above fifty
&s;everal whim&s;ical &s;ocieties, ingro&s;s in the whole a greater number of di&s;|&s;enters
to the prelatical church than the pre&s;byterians do, and are mortal
enemies to both, including within them that &s;ort of men which are mo&s;t
properly called republicans or commonwealth men, a re&s;tle&s;s, bold,
and bu&s;y-&s;pirit, ea&s;ie&s;t to be gained to your Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t, it be|ing
become a maxim among&s;t the wi&s;e&s;t of them, that &s;ince it appears
impracticable to unite and &s;ettle all intere&s;ts in a commonwealth, it is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore your Maje&s;ty and the right line, to keep off
the nece&s;&s;ity of a perpetual war, which the&s;e botching intails apparently
threatens, the nation with. Nay, in their maxims they go farther, and
&s;ay, that it were better for the kingdom in general, but mo&s;t for them|&s;elves
in particular, that the rightful Monarch &s;hould be a catholick ra|ther
than of the epi&s;copal or pre&s;byterian ways, which will ever in their
&s;everal turns when united to the crown, per&s;ecute or at lea&s;t di&s;counte|nance
them.</P>
<P>The numerous party of the Quakers cannot be reckoned under the la&s;t
head, and are not to be di&s;regarded as mad men, as they &s;eem to
many to be. For, generally &s;peaking, they are your Maje&s;ty's friends,
and in all di&s;cour&s;es with their oppugners charge them with their inhuman
and unju&s;t dealing with their rightful prince; an argument that non|plu&s;&s;es
<PB N="604" REF="632">
all, and converts &s;ome to &s;ee the wickedne&s;s of their ways. Be|&s;ides,
to my certain experience, there are many capable of being agents
and negotiators among&s;t them, as willing as able if well directed.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the non-jurant party of the nation may be thought of, though
not numerous enough without the catholicks to make any con&s;iderable
&s;trength or appearance in the field. The&s;e, however, are re&s;pected as men
of honour, that the penitent or di&s;contented may &s;afely open their minds
to and can confide in, &s;o that properly in&s;tructed they are &s;afe agitators di&s;|per&s;ed
in every corner of the nation, who too, upon occa&s;ion, will to a
man appear in the field for your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As for the Catholicks, though I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, they &s;eem the mo&s;t
de&s;ponding and lea&s;t u&s;eful party in the kingdom; nay, which is wor&s;e,
they are the only people who encourage the intere&s;ted and athie&s;tical to
&s;tick to the prince of Orange, though they both de&s;pi&s;e and hate him as
much as any; for the avowed de&s;pair the prie&s;ts have brought tho&s;e to
is &s;o univer&s;ally owned, that it di&s;courages the waverers from declaring
them&s;elves to be for their duty, and confirms the malicious in their in&s;o|lence,
&s;o that &s;ome cour&s;e mu&s;t be taken for altering their conduct and
conver&s;ation, or they will prove the greate&s;t remora to any good de&s;ign
may be &s;et on foot.</P>
<P>This, in &s;hort, is the po&s;ture I left England in, and may &s;erve for a
plan by which your Maje&s;ty may judge, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, what may be
expected from &s;uch propo&s;als as have or may be made for your &s;ervice,
ever premi&s;ing that the principal adver&s;ary has not one Engli&s;hman that
loves him or his per&s;onal intere&s;t, whatever they may the u&s;e of his po|wer;
and therefore I conclude it to be much more ea&s;y to pu&s;h him out of
the &s;addle, and procure a re&s;toration in his life time, than by expecting his
death. Let a de&s;cent be ca&s;t according to their malicious intail: for if
the prince&s;s of Denmark or any other come to mount the throne, it will
require &s;ome con&s;iderable time to render hers or their government as
odious as his now is become.</P>
<P>To this I know may be an&s;wered, that in his fall the intere&s;t of Hol|land
will be di&s;united from that of England, and thereby the King of
France will have a much ea&s;ier game to play for your Maje&s;ties &s;ervice.
Too tender a point I confe&s;s to be handled as it ought to be by me, who
cannot penetrate into the my&s;terious behaviour of that court; and there|fore
would propo&s;e a method to re&s;tore your Maje&s;ties without the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="605" REF="633">
of any armed force from them, which perhaps, as the mini&s;ters
may manage the matter, might prove of greater detriment than advan|tage
to that main end, let their King's good-will and candour be never &s;o
great, for I do not in the lea&s;t doubt the integrity of &s;o glorious a prince,
nor que&s;tion his earne&s;t de&s;ire of being the chief in&s;trument in &s;o great a
work, that he might add that one branch to his many laurels.</P>
<P>But it will be much ea&s;ier to induce his council to con&s;ent to the em|broiling
of Britain in a civil war than to grant your Maje&s;ties &s;ufficient
forces for making a full conque&s;t, which is the only thing can ever
make the Kings of England &s;trong or great, and may I conceive, be
brought about with little help from them, if your Maje&s;ties &s;itting &s;till
at St. Germains will but employ proper agents to foment the pre&s;ent ani|mo&s;ities
in both nations, and by your &s;ecret influence bring the &s;everal
jarring parties to an open rupture. But till I under&s;tand your Maje&s;|ties
will be willing to lend an ear to &s;ome propo&s;itions to that purpo&s;e,
I am &s;ilent.</P>
<P>For it may be the tenderne&s;s of your Maje&s;ties, for the &s;ubjects mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily fall into &s;uch a war may prove a &s;cruple you will not ea&s;ily
get over.</P>
<P>Or, perhaps your Maje&s;ties mini&s;ters may have promi&s;es from
&s;ome great ones in both kingdoms that the bu&s;ine&s;s will be brought
about &s;ome other way, to which it is not proper for me to oppo&s;e my
weaker judgment, though I confe&s;s my&s;elf an ab&s;olute infidel to all &s;uch
notions, and will be bold to &s;ay, had it not been for &s;uch chymeras as
I think them, your Maje&s;ties might have been freely &s;ettled on your
throne long ere this time, by a national force unre&s;i&s;tible by your Maje&s;|ties
mo&s;t inveterable enemys.</P>
<P>As for Scotland, the ferment there has been &s;o great, and the rage
again&s;t the prince of Orange &s;o violent for two years pa&s;t, that I &s;tood
amazed till I came thither, that no u&s;e had been made of it. But now
I di&s;cern the mi&s;tery, but cannot applaud the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e who have
occa&s;ioned &s;uch a &s;tagnation of council in &s;uch a turbulence of humours
as has providentially offered them&s;elves for the King's &s;ervice, of which
I can find no man here yet knows any thing to the purpo&s;e, except they
unnece&s;&s;arily conceal from me their true &s;entiments of that matter, and

Hanmer [Hannover] and Wheatley [prince&s;s Anne] would be of as

&s;uppo&s;e that, ere this, Mr. Gurny [Marlborough] may be come to town,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some account of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick-Lunenburgh.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick-Lunenburgh had for &s;ome
time made a con&s;iderable figure in Germany, they only became ob|jects
of attention in Britain, when they were brought into the line of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion by the act of &s;ettlement which received the royal a&s;&s;ent in
June 1701. This circum&s;tance drew early upon them the corre&s;pondence
of &s;everal per&s;ons in the&s;e kingdoms; and their affairs and opinions are
clo&s;ely connected with our hi&s;tory, during the whole reign of Queen
Anne. Some account, therefore, of a family de&s;tined to &s;way the &s;cepter
of Britain, may not be an improper introduction to their corre&s;pondence
and &s;ecret negociations, which are contained in the&s;e volumes.</P>
<P>Erne&s;t of Brun&s;wick, duke of Zell, the &s;on of Henry the Young,
duke of Lunenburgh, was the ance&s;tor of all the princes of the hou&s;e
of Brun&s;wick that now exi&s;t. He &s;tudied under Luther at Wirten|burgh,
and was always a zealous a&s;&s;ertor of the doctrines of that un|daunted
reformer. He entered into the league of the prote&s;tant princes
again&s;t the Emperor Charles V. and was taken pri&s;oner with the elector
of Saxony at the battle of Mulberg 1547. By Sophia, daughter of
Henry duke of Mecklenburgh, he had four &s;ons and four daughters.
Francis Otho, his elde&s;t &s;on, and Frederick his &s;econd &s;on died without
i&s;&s;ue. His third &s;on Henry of Danneberg, was the founder of the
hou&s;e of Wolfenbuttle, and from William, his fourth &s;on, is de&s;cended
the branch of Hannover-Zell, that now &s;its on the throne of Great
Britain and Ireland.</P>
<P><PB N="613" REF="643">
Francis Otho, who &s;ucceeded his father, &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to King Ed|ward
VI. of England, to offer him the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of 10,000 men again&s;t
France, and to a&s;k his &s;i&s;ter the Lady Mary in marriage. But a peace
being concluded between France and England, the duke of Zell's
auxiliaries became unnece&s;&s;ary, and the lady Mary had been then promi&s;ed
to the infant of Portugal: Edward, however, as a te&s;timony of his re|gard
for the duke, gave him an annual pen&s;ion of 375 pounds &s;terling,
to be paid half-yearly, and continued during plea&s;ure. Francis Otho
died in three months after his marriage with Magdalen, the daughter of
Joachim II. marquis of Brandenburgh; and his &s;econd brother, Fre|derick,
was &s;lain in the battle of Siver&s;hou&s;en. Henry of Danne|berg,
the third &s;on of Erne&s;t duke of Zell, a prince of an ea&s;y temper,
and fond of retirement, having governed his father's dominions jointly
with his brother William, for ten years, contented him&s;elf at la&s;t with
Wolfenbuttle, and relinqui&s;hed the re&s;t of his paternal territories to
William and his de&s;cendants. This ce&s;&s;ion made by Henry of his birth,
right was the fir&s;t &s;tep towards the aggrandizement of the younger branch
of the Brun&s;wick family.</P>
<P>William, duke of Zell, the fourth &s;on of Erne&s;t, duke of Lunen|burgh
and Zell, married Dorothea the daughter of Chri&s;tian III. King of
Denmark, and had &s;even &s;ons, and eight daughters. Five of the daugh|ters
married into con&s;iderable families. But &s;ix of the &s;even &s;ons died
without legitimate i&s;&s;ue. Chri&s;tian, who &s;ucceeded his elde&s;t brother
Erne&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his attachment and &s;ervices to the un|fortunate
King and Queen of Bohemia, and by his frequent attempts
to a&s;&s;i&s;t Maurice prince of Orange. He was made knight of the garter
by King James I. and vi&s;ited England, in January 1625, where he was
received with the re&s;pect due to his rank and abilities. He died of a fever
at Wolfenbuttle, in the June of the following year. He was &s;ucceeded
in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by his brothers Augu&s;tus and Frederick. The&s;e two
princes and their brother George, the fifth &s;on of William duke of.
Zell, made a figure in the wars of Gu&s;tavus Adolphus, and were con|cerned
in all the tran&s;actions of Germany in the beginning of the la&s;t
century. In the year 1648, Frederick, the only &s;urviving &s;on of Wil|liam,
for his three younger brothers, Erne&s;t, Magnus, and John died before
<PB N="614" REF="644">
him, was &s;ucceeded in his dominions by his nephews, the &s;ons; of
George.</P>
<P>George, duke of Brun&s;wick and Lunenburgh, the &s;on of William,
duke of Zell, had married Anne Eleonora the daughter of Lewis,
Landgrave of He&s;&s;e Darm&s;tad, and left four &s;ons Chri&s;tian Lewis born
in 1622, George William born in 1624, John Frederick born in 1625,
and Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus born in 1629. Chri&s;tian Lewis re&s;ided at Hannover
until the death of his uncle Frederick, when, according to an agree|ment
with his brothers, he took to his &s;hare the duchies of Zell and
Lunenburgh. He died without i&s;&s;ue in 1665, and left his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
to his brother George William.</P>
<P>George William, duke of Zell and Lunenburgh, the &s;econd &s;on of
George duke of Brun&s;wick, fell in love at Bru&s;&s;els, with Eleonora
De&s;iniers, daughter to Alexander marquis of Olbreuze in Poitou, and
married her with his left hand, as being inferior to him in quality; but
the emperor made her afterwards a prince&s;s of the Empire. By her he
had Sophia Dorothea, whom he gave in marriage to his nephew George
Lewis the &s;on of the bi&s;hop of O&s;naburgh, who was afterwards King of
Great Britain.</P>
<P>John Frederick duke of Hannover, the third &s;on of George duke of
Brun&s;wick, was a Roman Catholick, and in clo&s;e alliance with Lewis
XIV. He died on his way to Rome in the year 1680, and leaving no
male i&s;&s;ue, was &s;ucceeded by his brother Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus bi&s;hop of
O&s;naburgh.</P>
<P>Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus, the fourth &s;on of George duke of Brun&s;wick, mar|ried
in 1658, the prince&s;s Sophia daughter of Frederick, Elector Pala|tine
and King of Bohemia, by Elizabeth daughter of James I. King of
Great Britain, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bi&s;hoprick of O&s;naburgh in
1661, by virtue of an article in the treaty of We&s;tphalia, which &s;e|cured
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of that bi&s;hoprick alternately to a Roman Catholick
bi&s;hop, and to a bi&s;hop of the Au&s;burgh confe&s;&s;ion, being a prince of
the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of O&s;naburgh and his brother John Frederick duke of
Hannover entered into a treaty with Lewis XIV. in 1671. It was pro|perly
<PB N="615" REF="645">
a treaty of neutrality; but, though the duke entered into another
of a more pernicious nature, when the war broke out in 1672, and
was very active in favouring the de&s;igns of Lewis, and in ob&s;tructing
the operations of the allies, the bi&s;hop was brought over to the &s;ide of
the latter before the end of the year 1674. He joined his brother the
duke of Zell with 5000 men, in the beginning of the next campaign,
and was with him at the battle of Con&s;erburgh and &s;iege of Treves,
and with the prince of Orange at the &s;iege of Ma&s;tricht in 1676. He
continued to &s;erve at the head of his own troops in the Netherlands,
until the treaty of Nimeguen, when he and the other princes of the
hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick entered into a treaty of peace with France.</P>
<P>The duke of Zell and the bi&s;hop of O&s;naburgh, now duke of Han|nover,
upon the death of his brother John Frederick in April 1680, re|ceived
a vi&s;it from the prince of Orange, accompanied by count Waldeck
and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction in the autumn in the &s;ame year. In 1684,
the two dukes &s;ent 10,000 of their troops, commanded by Frederick
Augu&s;tus the &s;econd, and Charles Philip the fourth &s;on of the duke of
Hannover, into the emperor's &s;ervice, who was then at war with the
Turks, and the next year the duke of Hannover &s;ent his third &s;on Maxi|milian
with 3000 men to &s;erve the Venetians in the Morea. The Emperor
Leopold, at the in&s;tigation of William the Third, King of England,
erected a ninth electorate in the per&s;on of the duke of Hannover on the
29th of December 1692. This erection was made in oppo&s;ition to the
elder branch of the family of Brun&s;wick, and of the Roman Catholick
princes, and was not for &s;everal years acknowledged in form. Both he
and his brother adhered to the allies, in the war, which was carried on
at that time, again&s;t France. They had 6000 men in the Emperor's &s;er|vice,
in Hungary, and 8000 of their troops &s;erved every campaign under
King William in Flanders, until a peace was concluded at Ry&s;wick:
the elector died the 23d of January 1698, and was &s;ucceeded by his
elde&s;t &s;on George Lewis.</P>
<P>The remaining i&s;&s;ue of Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus, and the prince&s;s, Sophia,
were, Frederick Augu&s;tus born in 1661, Maximilian born in 1666.
Charles Philip born in 1669. Chri&s;tian born in 1671. Erne&s;t Augu&s;|tus
<PB N="616" REF="646">
born in 1674, and Sophia Charlotta born in 1668. She married
Frederick III. Elector of Brandenburgh, and &s;he died Queen of Pru&s;&s;ia,
February 1, 1705.</P>
<P>Frederick Augu&s;tus and Charles Philip commanded the 10,000 men
which the princes of the hou&s;e of Lunenburgh &s;ent, in 1684, to the
Emperor who was then at war with the Turks. They &s;ignalized them|&s;elves
by their conduct, and valour, and were both &s;lain in battle in 1691.</P>
<P>Maximilian conducted to the Morea the body of troops which his fa|ther
had in the pay of the republick of Venice in 1686. He &s;erved two
campaigns with great di&s;tinction under the generals Moro&s;ini and Ko|ning&s;mark,
and upon the death of Koning&s;mark, and the &s;ickne&s;s of the
Doge Moro&s;ini, he had the chief command during a con&s;iderable part
of the third. His &s;ervices were generou&s;ly rewarded by the Republick
with the rank of general, and an annual pen&s;ion of 6000 ducats. Upon
his return from Italy, he formed a party to maintain his preten&s;ions to
&s;ucceed to the duchy of Zell after the death of his uncle. Some of his
adherents were executed, and he him&s;elf was impri&s;oned for &s;ome time:
but he renounced, at la&s;t, his preten&s;ions, and agreed to accept of an
annual pen&s;ion. He entered into the Imperial &s;ervice upon the breaking
out of the war, which was occa&s;ioned by the di&s;putes about the Spani&s;h
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in the beginning of this century His brother Chri&s;tian ro&s;e to
the rank of major-general in the &s;ame &s;ervice, but was unfortunately kill|ed
after the battle of Munderkingen, as he was attempting to &s;wim on
hor&s;eback over the Danube, in 1703. Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus the &s;ixth, and
younge&s;t &s;on of the Elector and the prince&s;s Sophia, &s;erved the preceding
campaign under the duke of Marlborough. He was cho&s;en bi&s;hop of O&s;|naburgh
in March, and was created duke of York and Albany and earl of Ul&s;ter, and made a knight of the garter, in July 1716. He died
unmarried on the 14th of Augu&s;t 1728.</P>
<P>George Lewis, afterwards George the Fir&s;t, King of Great Britain,
the elde&s;t &s;on of Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus and the prince&s;s Sophia, was born
on the twenty eighth of May 1660. When prince of O&s;naburgh, he
&s;erved, at the age of fifteen, the &s;ucce&s;sful campaign of 1675, under
his father and uncle, and was pre&s;ent at the battle of Con&s;erburgh and

&s;iege of Treves. He became prince of Hannover, upon his father's
acce&s;&s;ion to that dutchy, after the death of John Frederick, without
male i&s;&s;ue, in 1680, and vi&s;ited France and England in the latter end of
the &s;ame year. He came here to make his addre&s;&s;es to the prince&s;s
Anne; but he was &s;uddenly recalled by his father, who thought it more
for the intere&s;t of their family to marry him to his niece. Wood gives
a very particular account of his reception and creation, as doctor of laws,
at Oxford, in February, 1681. He married Sophia Dorothea, daughter
and heire&s;s of his uncle, George William, duke of Zell, on the eleventh
of November, 1682; and by her had i&s;&s;ue, George Augu&s;tus, born on
the thirteenth of October, 1683, and afterwards King of Great Britain;
and Sophia Dorothea, born on the eighteenth of March, 1687. She
married Frederick William, King of Pru&s;&s;ia, the fourteenth of Novem|ber,
1706. He &s;ucceeded his father, as elector of Brun&s;wick-Lunen|burgh,
on the twenty-third of January, 1698.</P>
<P>The de&s;cendants of James I. and Charles I. who were nearer in blood
to the royal family in England and Scotland than any of the prote&s;tant
line, were fifty-&s;even in number &dagger;, when George the Fir&s;t acceded to
the crown of Great Britain; but being Roman Catholics, their preten|&s;ions
were rejected; and the prince&s;s Sophia, electre&s;s and duche&s;s
dowager of Hannover, daughter to the prince&s;s Elizabeth, late Queen of
Bohemia, daughter of James I. King of England, was declared next in
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, by an act which received the royal a&s;&s;ent on the
twelfth of June, 1701. The earl of Macclesfield was &s;ent to Hannover
with this act, to the electre&s;s, and the garter to her &s;on.</P>
<P>William the Third, King of England, dying on the eighth of March,
1702, was &s;ucceeded on the throne by Queen Anne; but notwith&s;tand|ing
the declarations of the Queen and parliament, in favour of the pro|te&s;tant
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the good reception given to the count de Platens,
envoy extraordinary from the duke of Zell and the elector, the putting
the direction of affairs in the hands of the Tories, gave &s;ome apprehen|&s;ions
to the family of Hannover, as appears from imperfect hints, in the
little we have of their corre&s;pondence in the cour&s;e of this year.</P>
<P>They, however, &s;howed a zeal for the cau&s;e in which the Briti&s;h na|tions
were at this time engaged. A war with France appeared to be

to gain the German princes to his intere&s;t, and, among others, he &s;uc|ceeded
with the dukes of Brun&s;wick Wol&s;enbuttle. There are copies
extant, in Robethon's hand-writing, of &s;everal letters from King William
to many of the&s;e princes.</P>
<P>The dukes, Anthony Ulric and Rodolph Augu&s;tus, governed jointly
the dominions of Wol&s;enbutle. Rodolph cultivated letters and philo|&s;ophy
in retirement, and left the chief management of affairs to his bro|ther,
who, from a jealou&s;y of the advancement of the younger branch of
the family, and out of oppo&s;ition to them, contracted a clo&s;e alliance
with France.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 11.</NOTE> King William, in a letter to the duke of Ploen, dated at
Dieren, 14th October, 1701, recommending to him to act in concert
with the duke of Zell, who was well affected to the common cau&s;e,
de&s;ires him to oppo&s;e the intrigues of duke Anthony Ulric, and to con|vince
duke Rodolph of the imprudence of his brother's connexions;
and it appears, by letters from him to the duke of Ploen, and to Rodolph
him&s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paid. No. 14, 15.</NOTE> dated Hampton-court, 20th December, 1701, that Ploen had
&s;ucceeded in detaching Rodolph from the French intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But Anthony Ulric continued firm in his engagements with Lewis, un|til
he was obliged to break them, in con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures which
King William had concerted with the duke of Zell and elector of Hanno|ver,
and which they put in execution the week after his Maje&s;ty died. They
entered the dominions of Wolfenbuttle unexpectedly, &s;urpri&s;ed the troops
di&s;per&s;ed in their quarters, inve&s;ted both Wol&s;enbuttle and Brun&s;wick at
once, di&s;concerted all the mea&s;ures of Anthony Ulric, and obliged him
to leave his brother at liberty to fall in with the common intere&s;ts of the
empire. The princes of Brun&s;wick Lunenburgh being after this in no
danger of mole&s;tation from their neighbours, had upwards of 40,000
men in the &s;ervice of the different powers who declared war this year
again&s;t France and Spain; and prince Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus, afterwards bi&s;hop
of O&s;naburgh and duke of York and Albany, the younge&s;t brother of
the elector, &s;erved this campaign under the duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>The name of Mon&s;ieur de Robethon will occur &s;o frequently in this

Brun&s;wick Lunenburgh. He appears to have been a French refugee
and a kind of private &s;ecretary to King William.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannover Papers, vol. marked Mi&s;|cell, d'Etat. 2.</NOTE> There are &s;ome letters
addre&s;&s;ed to him in that capacity, in Mr. Cole's collection; and in his

<P>Robethon attached him&s;elf to the family of Brun&s;wick, before he left
King William's &s;ervice. When the duke of Zell came to &s;ee the King
at Loo, in the year 1701, lord Portland, who appears to have had a
very great e&s;teem for Robethon, and corre&s;ponded con&s;tantly with him,

re&s;pects to the duke, that he knew then he had a great deal of influence
with his highne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a paper of Robethon's,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. No. 210.</NOTE> and indor&s;ed by him, <HI>Speeches for the
King and Queen of Pru&s;&s;ia, which I compo&s;ed for Lord Raby,</HI> 1701. He
wrote all the letters which George the Fir&s;t and Second, and Queen Ca|roline,
&s;ent to this country from the time he entered into their &s;ervice,
until the time the family arrived in Britain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol. marked Princes.</NOTE> The fir&s;t rough draughts of

be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons in this and in other countries, are but co|pies
made from what Robethon wrote for them.</P>
<P>The family of Hannover could not have employed a per&s;on better
qualified for their purpo&s;e than Robethon; he &s;eems to have been inde|fatigable,
indu&s;trious and faithful, and though he might not have been

<P>&startq;I See, by your letter of the 19th, that the court of Hannover has had
no difficulty, hitherto, in managing the court of England; but
that they will be embarra&s;&s;ed if the Queen &s;hould propo&s;e to parliament to make the prince of Denmark King; and that they cannot prevail on

<P>THE duke of Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1703. January.</NOTE> always attached to the intere&s;ts of the exiled

&s;ummer, thrown that a&s;&s;embly into &s;uch di&s;repute with the nation,
that the queen thought it prudent to di&s;&s;olve it, early in the pre&s;ent year.
He had been followed in this &s;ece&s;&s;ion by &s;eventy-nine members; and,
therefore, tho&s;e that remained were denominated the Rump, by the po|pulace.
The influence which the duke acquired, by this mea&s;ure, in|duced
the court of St. Germains to &s;end the following in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>They are in French, and in Nairne's hand. The per&s;on to whom they
were given was captain James Murray, brother to Mr. Murray of Aber|cairny.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>&startq;In&s;tructions to the per&s;on who is to &s;peak to L. A.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's Papers, D. N. vol. ii, 4to. No. 50.</NOTE> (meaning Lord Ar|ran,
the title given to the duke of Hamilton, at St. Germains)
Jan. 1703.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>&startq;AFTER having &s;hown to L. A. all that is nece&s;&s;ary to te&s;tify to
him the high e&s;teem which their Maje&s;ties have for his per&s;on and
his merit towards them&s;elves, he is to be entreated to repre&s;ent to L. C.
[lord Churchill] when he &s;hall find him in the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to li&s;ten,
that the union between their families obliges him to be particularly at|tentive
to every thing which regards his honour, his e&s;tabli&s;hment, and his
&s;afety; which he believes can never be &s;ufficiently &s;ecured, without acknow|ledging
and di&s;charging the obligation which he owes the father, by doing
ju&s;tice to the &s;on and, in con&s;equence of doing this, he may a&s;&s;ure him|&s;elf,
that he will have a carte-blanche for him&s;elf and for his friends, and
that otherwi&s;e he will have rea&s;on to fear di&s;agreeable con&s;equences. For
<PB N="624" REF="656">
immediately upon the expiration of the pre&s;ent reign, it will be nece&s;&s;ary,
according to the late act of &s;ettlement, to proclaim Hannover, who can
never think him&s;elf in &s;afety, without relying upon the Dutch, and em|ploying
his friends of the Pre&s;byterian party in England; and, in that
ca&s;e, there will be no quarter for him nor for the church of England.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who judge wi&s;ely, can have no apprehen&s;ions from a Catho|lic
King, becau&s;e, as &s;uch, he will have neither the credit nor the means
to hurt them; and, to maintain him&s;elf, will be obliged to govern ac|cording
to the will of his people. What is pa&s;t can be no argument
again&s;t this. For it is certain, that the inconveniencies of the wrong
mea&s;ures, which were formerly adopted, will be &s;ufficient in&s;tructions for
regulating tho&s;e, which will be adopted hereafter, and of this will be
given all the a&s;&s;urances which can be demanded, and which can any|ways
con&s;i&s;t with the &s;ecurity of the King's per&s;on, and of his con&s;cience
and dignity.</P>
<P>If he &s;hall &s;cruple to do this, for fear of failing in his duty to the mi&s;|tre&s;s
whom he now &s;erves, it may be &s;aid to him, that all the&s;e difficul|ties
may be ea&s;ily adju&s;ted by a treaty, which will leave her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the crown of England, during her life, providing that &s;he will choo&s;e
to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the King, her brother, after her death. To
&s;ill the army, the navy, and all the employments in the kingdom, with
per&s;ons who are well affected, are excellent means; but neither the&s;e
means, nor the act of occa&s;ional conformity, will be &s;ufficient, unle&s;s the
&s;ettlement, in favour of the family of Hannover, be overturned, which
does not appear to be impracticable, in this parliament, where it may be
repre&s;ented, as a mea&s;ure unju&s;t in it&s;elf, and dangerous to the church of
England and to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>That, con&s;idering the ju&s;tice and piety of his mi&s;tre&s;s, it is not to be
&s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;he will be inclined to oppo&s;e a thing, &s;o &s;uitable to her
character, and to what &s;he owes to the memory of her father, and to her
own glory; which obliges her not to allow the crown to go out of her

royal dignity, and to do all this in favour of a &s;tranger, and of the mo&s;t
di&s;tant relation &s;he has in the world.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t effectual means of &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown of
England to the King, after the death of his &s;i&s;ter, would be to put him
<PB N="625" REF="657">
now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown of Scotland, by &s;uch ways, and in &s;uch a
manner, as will be judged mo&s;t proper; and, as the two kingdoms are
independent of one another, this partition for the pre&s;ent time, might
be ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed; and the Engli&s;h would have le&s;s difficulty to con|&s;ent
to it, that the kingdom of Scotland brings them no profit; and there
is nothing to hinder the King and his &s;i&s;ter, after this partition, from
living together in as &s;trict friend&s;hip, as their great-grandfather lived
with Q. Elizabeth.</P>
<P>But whether this propo&s;al will be accepted or rejected, it is nece&s;&s;ary
that they &s;hould enter into a league with France, which, by a &s;ecret ar|ticle,
will engage it&s;elf to guarantee our treaty, in order that we may
have the &s;upport of a foreign power to balance that of Holland, which,
without that, will join the Pre&s;byterian party, di&s;concert all weak precau|tions,
ruin the church of England, and infallibly extirpate it and its
friends.</P>
<P>L. A. is entreated to propo&s;e the&s;e things, as if they came from him&s;elf
alone. But he ought, at the &s;ame time, to urge them to employ &s;ome
one to explain their intentions, and to learn the &s;entiments of their Ma|je&s;ties,
without which nothing can be concluded; and both the one and
the other may ruin them&s;elves by too much precaution. If it is objected,
that a &s;ecret cannot be kept at St. Germains; they may addre&s;s them|&s;elves
immediately to the court of Ver&s;ailles, where the &s;ame inconveni|ency
is not to be feared.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, that delays are dangerous, becau&s;e all depends on a &s;ingle
life; and even the life that appears mo&s;t &s;ure, is very uncertain.&endq;</P>
<P>The following in&s;tructions were complied with by the party who ad|hered
to the duke of Hamilton. They put a &s;top to the treaty of
Union. They rejected, with every mark of indignation and contempt,
the overture made by the earl of Marchmont, for &s;ettling the crown on
the hou&s;e of Hannover; and they effectually prevented the abjuration.
During a turbulent and tedious &s;e&s;&s;ion, the country-party in every que&s;|tion
prevailed; till, at length, the commi&s;&s;ioner found him&s;elf obliged to
adjourn the hou&s;e, without obtaining any &s;upply.</P>

of Wales to one of Marlborough's daughters, even before the death of
the marquis of Blandford had left the duke no hopes of po&s;terity, but
through the female line. The negociation, if it was ever carried to any
height, &s;hews the high opinion which the &s;ervants of the pretended prince
entertained of Marlborough's power; at the &s;ame time, that it exhibits
the judgment which they formed concerning his invariable attachment

that gentleman; and then he might have known, in an honourable man|ner,

Mr. Gilburn [Godolphin] have lately had, in their home affairs. He is
only &s;orry that it came by any other means, or any other hand than his

it. So that in the&s;e matters, I hope you will do him ju&s;tice with your

at court, it is evident, that there is too much rea&s;on to be confirmed in
this opinion.</P>
<P>By a combination of &s;everal accidents, which happened &s;ince the death
of the King, and which could not probably have happened at any other
time, the members of the hou&s;e of commons have been cho&s;en in a man|ner
well calculated to extend the views of that party; and accordingly
they do not &s;cruple to acknowledge this. It is not to be imagined, that
they will choo&s;e to act directly for the prince of Wales: accordingly they
have adopted another method, by propo&s;ing two bills in the lower hou&s;e;
the fir&s;t in order to renew the di&s;putes between the members of the
church of England and the pre&s;byterians, which, having formerly di&s;|turbed
the quiet of the kingdom, for a long time, had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
during the preceding reign; and they hope, that, amid&s;t the&s;e animo&s;i|ties,
they will more ea&s;ily conceal and advance their de&s;igns. The &s;e|cond
<PB N="635" REF="667">
bill appeared to have been intended in favour of tho&s;e, who, by
accident, had neglected to take the oath of abjuration of the prince of
Wales, in the time limited, and for maintaining the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;
but the real de&s;ign was to re-e&s;tabli&s;h all tho&s;e who had refu&s;ed that oath,
and to di&s;mi&s;s all &s;uch as had been put into their places and offices.</P>
<P>If the&s;e two bills had pa&s;&s;ed, one may ea&s;ily judge what would have
been the con&s;equence. But the hou&s;e of peers, having a ju&s;t apprehen|&s;ion
of the danger of their de&s;igns, rejected, with great firmne&s;s, the fir&s;t,
and not only took every thing that was mi&s;chievous and bad out of the
&s;econd, but added two clau&s;es to it; by the fir&s;t of which the oath of
abjuration is impo&s;ed upon the whole kingdom of Ireland, which they
had forgot to comprehend in the former act; and the &s;econd makes all
tho&s;e guilty of high trea&s;on who &s;hall attempt, either directly or indirectly,
to prevent the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the family of Hannover: and all this affair
was conducted by the lords with &s;o much addre&s;s, that tho&s;e who brought
in the bill dared not oppo&s;e the clau&s;e directly, for fear of expo&s;ing them|&s;elves
and lo&s;ing their credit in the kingdom, and by the&s;e means, that
act, far from an&s;wering their expectation, has rendered the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
more &s;table and certain. But, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this majority
in the hou&s;e of peers, chagrined the &s;aid party to &s;uch a degree, that Sir
Edward Seymour did not he&s;itate to &s;ay openly in the hou&s;e of commons,
that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that the Queen &s;hould make &s;ome new
peers, in order that the majority of that hou&s;e might concur in the de|&s;igns
of the lower hou&s;e. However indi&s;creet this &s;peech was, the mea|&s;ure
has been adopted; for the Queen has made &s;ome new peers &s;ince
the prorogation of the parliament, of whom the &s;on of Sir E. Seymour
is one, and another is the only man who refu&s;ed to give his vote for
e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the family of Hannover.</P>
<P>I will not trouble you with the character of the re&s;t. I &s;hall only tell
you, that two of them are of the &s;ame party. There are none of the&s;e
facts which are not manife&s;t, and above all contradiction. If you con|ver&s;e
with your own mini&s;ter at this court he cannot deny this. Having
now &s;tated the ca&s;e, I &s;hall take the liberty of repre&s;enting to you my
reflections, upon certain things, which I believe to be very u&s;eful for the
&s;ervice of the Elector.</P>
<P><PB N="636" REF="668">
1. It would be de&s;irable that his electoral highne&s;s &s;hould embrace
every &s;uitable opportunity of publi&s;hing, in his conver&s;ation, as well as
by the intimations of his mini&s;ters, that, &s;ince his family is called to the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he is determined to hazard every thing for maintaining his
right, and for &s;upporting tho&s;e who are truly attached to his intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>2. As it was very prudent in his mini&s;ter to act with great re&s;erve and
circum&s;pection, while every thing was in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; &s;o it would not be
proper that he &s;hould continue his &s;ilence, after the mini&s;try here have
given ju&s;t cau&s;e of jealou&s;y. On the contrary, it would be &s;erviceable
that this mini&s;ter &s;hould, from time to time, make &s;uitable repre&s;enta|tions
again&s;t the attempts which &s;hall be made to the prejudice of the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>3. It will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make it known, that the Elector
places an entire confidence in the man who is, or &s;hall be, his mini&s;ter
here; and that whatever he &s;hall advance or promi&s;e in the name of his
ma&s;ter may be depended upon.</P>
<P>4. As it appears, from what I have &s;aid above, that all employments
and favours are given to tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite party, I mu&s;t inform you
likewi&s;e, that &s;everal per&s;ons who have acted very zealou&s;ly, and who
di&s;tingui&s;ned them&s;elves in &s;upporting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law,
have lo&s;t their employments; and as &s;ome of them maintained them|&s;elves
principally by the emoluments which they drew from their em|ployments
and pen&s;ions, I leave you to judge, if it would not be &s;er|viceable
to come to a re&s;olution of doing &s;omething for them; and par|ticularly
for tho&s;e who have titles, and few means to &s;upport them. I
&s;peak of &s;ome members of the hou&s;e of peers, and of the advantage of
pre&s;erving and augmenting the number of tho&s;e who are well affected in
that hou&s;e, which may be done at a very moderate expence, if properly
managed; and unle&s;s it is &s;oon re&s;olved to do &s;omething of this nature,
I do not &s;ee by what means, or in what manner, the bad de&s;igns and
mea&s;ures of the party can be prevented, when the hou&s;e of peers mu&s;t
be con&s;idered as the principal &s;upport of that intere&s;t.</P>
<P>5. And &s;ince the lives of princes are uncertain, &s;uch proper mea&s;ures
mu&s;t be taken, on all hands, that when the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is open, all things
may be di&s;po&s;ed for entering immediately into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. All that I &s;ay
<PB N="637" REF="669">
here is not only my own opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April&mdash;May.</NOTE> but the opinion of others, whom I be|lieve
to be the mo&s;t capable of judging, and who are the be&s;t affected to
the good cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add one thing more, which is to renew the caution that was
given to you la&s;t year, with re&s;pect to our general [Marlborough.] You
mu&s;t not judge of him by what he &s;ays, but by what he does here; and
e&s;pecially you mu&s;t not believe him, if he &s;ays, that Lord Rivers de|&s;ired
to leave the &s;ervice; for it is certain, that he was forced to do &s;o,
for having voted as you would have done, if you had been in his place;
and the &s;um which was given to him, being but the half of what is or|dinarily
given for po&s;ts of that kind, has been a cloak to conceal their
de&s;ign and to prevent complaints.&endq;</P>
<P>The following letter &s;eems to convey pretty ju&s;tly the views of the Scotti&s;h
Jacobites in parliament. The writer, however, is mi&s;taken, in the opi|nion,
that they thought it nece&s;&s;ary to change the church government,
before they entered upon their de&s;igns in favour of the exiled family.
The overture, for a toleration to tho&s;e of the epi&s;copal per&s;ua&s;ion, was
made by the earl of Strathmore. But it met with &s;o little countenance,
from the Jacobites them&s;elves, that at the requi&s;ition of the general a&s;|&s;embly,
it was dropt almo&s;t without debate.</P>

<DATELINE>London, <DATE>May 18, 1703.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;SINCE my la&s;t, there hath occurred very little material. The par|liament
of Scotland met, on the 22d, according to adjournment;
and were, all that day, upon controverted elections. It is &s;till &s;aid, as I
told you before, that the great bu&s;ine&s;s of this &s;e&s;&s;ion will be, to get a
toleration for the epi&s;copal clergy; and, that this toleration may the bet|ter
an&s;wer the expectation of the court, it is thought there will be &s;ome
attempt made for the re&s;toring of patronages; for then it will be an ea&s;y
matter to get &s;uch per&s;ons pre&s;ented to vacant benefices as will incline to
a change in church-government; a thing the court &s;eems to de&s;ire,
though I know nothing that could &s;o much &s;trengthen the Jacobite in|tere&s;t
<PB N="638" REF="670">
in Scotland:<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> but &s;ome will &s;ay, it is for that very rea&s;on the court
de&s;ires it; and really, all things con&s;idered, it is hard to give any other.
It appears plainly, that the greate&s;t hopes of the Jacobites are now from
Scotland; and that the way they propo&s;e to carry on their bu&s;ine&s;s there
is, fir&s;t to have their friends, the epi&s;copal people, brought into church-government;
when that is done, they fancy it may not be difficult to
get the parliament of Scotland to declare their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in favour of the
prince of Wales; and, if once they gain that point, they re&s;olve to act
a little more barefacedly in England. They will then repre&s;ent the dan|ger
of Scotland's having a King of its own, and what mi&s;chiefs may
happen to England upon the Scots joining with the Engli&s;h Jacobites.
From thence, perhaps, they may come to urge the breaking into the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion-act,
and the declaring with Scotland for the prince of Wales, as
things ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the peace of both kingdoms. This
I have ground to think is the Jacobites &s;cheme; and, though I am per|&s;uaded
they will never be able to effectuate it, yet, con&s;idering how
things are managed here, tho&s;e who wi&s;h well to the hou&s;e of Hannover,
have all the rea&s;on in the world to be upon their guard: but more of this
at meeting.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>1704.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1704.</NOTE> which &s;ucceeded the revolution in Britain, the
court of St. Germains continued their &s;ecret negociations, and
formed perpetual &s;chemes for invading England. But when peace was
concluded, King James, re&s;igning him&s;elf to the au&s;terities of religion,
&s;eems to have built all his hopes of re&s;toration, upon the favourable
events which might happen, in the cour&s;e of time. His &s;ervants, how|ever,
kept up a communication with his friends, more with a de&s;ign of
retaining them in their principles, than from expectations of their imme|diate
&s;ervices. In this &s;ituation of affairs, Simon Fra&s;er, well-known
afterwards by the title of lord Lovat, a man who joined in&s;inuating
talents to low manners and a profligate character, came to St. Germains,
and offered his &s;ervices to King James. Fra&s;er, having committed, in
Scotland, public and private crimes, which threatened to draw upon
him the ultimate animadver&s;ions of the laws of his country, had fled
from ju&s;tice: but his hi&s;tory being known before his arrival, King James,
from motives of morality, rejected his offered &s;ervices. Having conti|nued
for &s;ome time in a &s;tarving condition, in France, he applied, through
a Mr. Car&s;tares, to King William, for a pardon; no doubt, under pro|mi&s;es
of future &s;ervices. In this pardon, which the principal &s;ecretary
of &s;tate had refu&s;ed to &s;ign, either through accident or de&s;ign, a rape,
which Fra&s;er had committed on the dowager-lady Lovat, had not been
comprehended.</P>
<P>The marquis of Athol, father to the injured lady, pro&s;ecuted Fra&s;er
criminally, and he fled again from ju&s;tice into France. King James was
by this time dead: but the earl of Middleton, who knew his late ma&s;ter's
&s;entiments concerning Fra&s;er, refu&s;ed to admit him into his pre&s;ence.
But Fra&s;er, turning a Roman Catholic, in&s;inuated him&s;elf, through the
<PB N="640" REF="672">
influence of the Pope's nuncio, into the confidence of the exiled Queen;
and, through the &s;ame channel, he had acce&s;s to the French mini&s;try,
and, it is &s;aid, even to the King him&s;elf. But the &s;tate he gave of the
affairs of Scotland appearing too favourable to the views of the excluded
family to be implicitly believed, Lewis the Fourteenth demanded from
the court of St. Germains, a per&s;on who could be tru&s;ted to accompany
Fra&s;er into that kingdom, to bring back a genuine account of the &s;tate
of things. Fra&s;er, accordingly, in company with captain John Murray,
brother to Mr. Murray of Abercairny pa&s;&s;ing through England, ar|rived
on the borders of Scotland, in the &s;ummer of 1703. He was met
there, by the duke of Argyle, who had always been his patron, and
conducted by that nobleman to Edinburgh, where he received a pro|tection
from the duke of Queen&s;berry, commi&s;&s;ioner to the parliament
then &s;itting in that city. Under cover of this protection, Fra&s;er was
&s;ent into the Highlands to extract promi&s;es of &s;upporting the preten&s;ions
of the exiled family, from tho&s;e chiefs and noblemen, who were known
to be in their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Fra&s;er's character was too well known to be tru&s;ted. He returned,
with little &s;ucce&s;s, to Edinburgh, and formed a &s;cheme, with the duke
of Queen&s;berry, of accu&s;ing &s;everal of his own enemies and &s;ome of tho&s;e
of the duke, of a corre&s;pondence with the court of St. Germains. But
the proofs which he could produce being in&s;ufficient, he was provided
with money and a pa&s;s, under a feigned name, by Queen&s;berry, to en|able
him to return to France to forge or make more complete di&s;coveries.
The famous Fergu&s;on, with whom Fra&s;er had &s;ome communications on
his return to London, &s;u&s;pecting his &s;incerity, had, in the mean time, in|formed
the duke of Athol, one of the noblemen accu&s;ed, though he had
never been in any corre&s;pondence whatever with the court of St. Ger|mains,
of the &s;chemes laid to ruin him and others. The noi&s;e which
this di&s;covery made in the Engli&s;h parliament is well known. Fra&s;er ar|rived
at Paris; and, in pro&s;ecution of his promi&s;es to Queen&s;berry, pre|&s;ented
the following memorial:</P>

<PB N="641" REF="673">
<HEAD>&startq;A Memorial to the Queen of all that my Lord Lovat did in his voyage to
England and Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">January.</NOTE> by her Maje&s;ty's orders.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nairne's papers, D. N vol ii. fol No 52.</NOTE>&endq;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Original.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;AS &s;oon as he arrived in England, he informed him&s;elf of the di&s;po|&s;itions
of the people for their King. He found, that, in Eng|land,
the King had lo&s;t much of the inclinations of his &s;ubjects, who
pretended to be faithful to him in the prince of Orange's time, becau&s;e
the prince&s;s of Denmark had given employments to tho&s;e that were ene|mies
to the prince of Orange; and tho&s;e, having received better places
than they expect if the King was re&s;tored, do not think or &s;uffer to hear
of him, although they have &s;worn a hundred times, that they would &s;a|crifice
their lives and fortunes for him. He marched from London,
with his friend captain Murray and three &s;ervants a-hor&s;e-back, to go to
the town of Durham, where he mu&s;t have waited &s;ome of his &s;ervants
from Scotland with hor&s;es and money. He e&s;caped happily to be taken
by a ju&s;tice of the peace, who arre&s;ted his valet de chambre, a French|man,
becau&s;e he neither &s;poke Engli&s;h or Dutch. When he came to
Durham, he found that the town was full of good Catholics of the gen|try
of the country, who were very faithful to the King his ma&s;ter. As
&s;oon as he was known to be in the town, having been acquainted there
before, all the Catholics came to wait of him, and knowing that he was
in France, as his enemies had publi&s;hed before he was two months in
France, by the information of the prince&s;s of Denmark's &s;pies at St.
Germains; all the&s;e Catholics made all the prote&s;tations imaginable of
their fidelity to the King, their ma&s;ter; and, when he &s;hewed them the
King's picture, they all fell down upon their knees and ki&s;&s;ed him and
prayed for him. My lord Lovat an&s;wered them, that he did not doubt,
but they loved their King; but that the common opinion was, that the
Catholics in England would be the la&s;t that would venture their lives
and fortunes for the King. They an&s;wered him, that that opinion was
very fal&s;e; and that tho&s;e who made &s;uch in&s;inuations to the court were
enemies to the King. Some days after, they made an a&s;&s;embly of all the
Catholic gentlemen of that country; and, after that they had been
&s;ome time together, they &s;ent four of their number to my lord Lovat, to
entreat him to inform the Queen, that all the Catholics in the North of
England, who were very numerous and powerful, were ready to venture
<PB N="642" REF="674">
their lives and fortunes for the King, whenever his banners &s;hould be
di&s;played in that country, and that they gave already &s;uch marks of their
fidelity, that they believed the Queen did not doubt their re&s;olutions to
&s;erve the King. There &s;tayed an Iri&s;h nobleman in that town, who was
in the la&s;t wars with the King in Ireland. My lord Lovat, finding him
a mo&s;t loyal &s;en&s;ible man, inquired of him, if any thing could be done
for the King, in Ireland. He told him, that the people were &s;o op|pre&s;&s;ed,
that, if the King of France would &s;end them arms, he would
engage his life and fortune, that he would get fifty thou&s;and to ri&s;e in
arms in that kingdom; and he gave commi&s;&s;ion to my lord Lovat, to
tell &s;o to the Queen and to the court of France; and that he was ready
to receive her Maje&s;ty's orders, to go to that country to prepare the
people to that effect.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat continued his journey towards Scotland; and as &s;oon
as he entered the country, his enemies were affrighted, and my lord
Athol, being afraid that, if my lord Lovat took arms, he would de&s;troy
all his e&s;tate, made a public complaint to the commi&s;&s;ioner, the duke of
Queen&s;berry, and to the council, that my lord Lovat was come from
France, as an emi&s;&s;ary from the French court, with money and officers
to rai&s;e the Highlands in rebellion again&s;t the Queen; and, if they did
not take mea&s;ures to take the &s;aid lord Lovat dead or alive, that no|body
in the government were &s;ure of their lives or fortunes; he had &s;uch
a great intere&s;t with all the Highlanders of Scotland. The marquis of
Athol gave to the commi&s;&s;ioner, as author, captain James Murray, who
&s;taid &s;o long at St. Germains, and who was in France, and knew when
my lord Lovat received his orders from the court of France. The com|mi&s;&s;ioner,
who was always my lord Lovat's good friend, who believed
that what my lord Athol &s;aid was malice, in&s;tead of giving orders out
again&s;t my lord Lovat, &s;ent him expre&s;sly his friend, and my lord Lo|vat's
intimate friend, the earl of Leven, to propo&s;e to him, in his name,
and in the name of the prince&s;s of Denmark, that, if he would &s;ide with
the prince&s;s, and enter with him and his friends into the intere&s;t of Han|nover,
that the prince&s;s of Denmark would immediately give him her
pardon and his e&s;tate; &s;he &s;hould pay the debts of his family, and give
him a regiment and a good pen&s;ion; becau&s;e they knew his power in the
<PB N="643" REF="675">
Highlands, which they feared, and that the Highlanders would do no|thing
without him.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat thanked the earl of Leven, and intrea$ed $word$ to thank
the duke of Queen&s;berry, in his name, for his kindne&s;s to him: but that
he was &s;o engaged in the intere&s;ts of his King, and in the intere&s;ts of
France, that he would never abandon them, till he gave an account of
his journey; and, be&s;ides, he thought it his intere&s;t never to alter from
the King's &s;ide, &s;ince he was &s;ure that the King of France would re&s;tore
him in a &s;hort time. Therefore, he begged of him to con&s;ider, that his
family would be ruined and extirpated, when the King came home, if
he did not appear timou&s;ly for him. He &s;o frighted the earl, with the
King's going home, and the forces of France, that he gave him com|mi&s;&s;ion
to make his peace with the King.</P>
<P>The next day, he had an appointment with the marquis of Drum|mond
and captain Murray, near the ports of Edinburgh. He told them
what the earl of Leven propo&s;ed to him. They did not know how to
advi&s;e him. He, finding them at a &s;tand, told my lord Drummond,
you &s;ee, that tho&s;e offers are very great; but that he would not take
the whole kingdom of Scotland to abandon the intere&s;t of his King and
the King of France, in which he was &s;o &s;olemnly engaged. He pro|po&s;ed
to my lord Drummond, that, if the low country would ri&s;e in
arms, he would get all the Highlanders to ri&s;e in arms and obey him;
and that, in a little time, they would make an army that would ma&s;ter the
kingdom; and that then he was &s;ure the King of France would &s;end
home the King, and all the nece&s;&s;aries that were requi&s;ite to put him on
the throne. My lord Drummond an&s;wered him, that he was very willing
to take arms; but that he had not the King's commi&s;&s;ion. But, as &s;oon
as he got the King's commi&s;&s;ion, that he would then, without fail, take
arms; and, in the mean time, prepare matters for it; and likewi&s;e begged
of my lord Lovat not to go near his own country; &s;ince he mu&s;t take
arms if he went there, which would very much wrong the King's intere&s;t.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat, finding that none of the low country would &s;tir, with|out
commi&s;&s;ions; and that the Queen had ordered him expre&s;sly, that he
&s;hould make no ri&s;ing, till &s;uch time as captain Murray &s;hould return
to France, &s;acrificed his clan and intere&s;t for the intere&s;t of his King;
and left all thoughts of ri&s;ing in arms, till he &s;ent an expre&s;s to France;
<PB N="644" REF="676">
becau&s;e he was afraid, that he and the chieftains of clans that were to
join him, would be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed before they got a&s;&s;i&s;tance from France.
He told my lord Dummond, that, becau&s;e he did not think &s;it to take
arms at that time, the kingdom of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be prepared to make a
general ri&s;ing for the King; and, for that purpo&s;e, he did charge him
to bring captain Murray with him, who was then pre&s;ent, to prepare the
low country, and that he &s;hould offer the command of the King's army
to duke Hamilton; and that if the duke did refu&s;e the King's com|mi&s;&s;ion,
that would pre&s;ently ruin him with the King's friends, who were
his &s;upport, that afterwards he could not be capable to do any hurt.
My lord Drummond had no good opinion of the duke, nor had any of
the King's friends. But he &s;aid to my lord Lovat, that he would pro|po&s;e
to the duke to take the King's commi&s;&s;ion; and that he did not
care what he did, &s;ince he was &s;ure of people of quality in the low
country without him. My lord Lovat was very glad to hear that from
him; and told him that he would a&s;&s;ure him of 20,000 Highlanders,
when the low country was ready to join them, and that he would march
immediately through all the Highlands, except his own country, where
his enemies had garri&s;ons to take up his rents; and that, when he had
a&s;&s;embled the mo&s;t con&s;iderable chiefs of clans, and had &s;hewn them the
King's in&s;tructions, he would then &s;end an expre&s;s for captain Murray,
that he might be pre&s;ent at their engagements and promi&s;es.</P>
<P>Having agreed on the&s;e re&s;olutions, they parted. The next day, the
earl of Argyle, who was lord Lovat's relation and his great friend, de|&s;ired
to have an appointment with him, which he, after advi&s;ing with
my lord Drummond and captain Murray, granted him; and accord|ingly
they met on the borders of Scotland. Argyle was a &s;ubtile man,
and lord Lovat refu&s;ing the offers he made him, which were the &s;ame
my lord Leven had made him the day before, he told him, that he knew
he was not &s;uch a fool as to refu&s;e them, without he had greater things
in hand. He begged of him to let him know them. My lord Lovat,
of nece&s;&s;ity, was obliged to di&s;&s;emble with him; and a&s;&s;ured him, that
there was nothing to do: but that, before he came from France, it was
believed that the parliament would either call home the King or ri&s;e in
arms for him; and that he came of purpo&s;e to rai&s;e all his kindred, and
all that would ri&s;e with him, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Argyle told him, that he
<PB N="645" REF="677">
did not think that he was &s;o ignorant as to believe, that a prote&s;tant
parliament would ever call home a popi&s;h King: that, on the contrary,
this pre&s;ent parliament had made an act to exclude the King and the
race, while they were Papi&s;ts. Lovat an&s;wered him, that what the par|liament
did would not &s;ignify a farthing; that, in &s;pite of them and all
his enemies, the King would be home. He, to demon&s;trate to Argyle
the great force and wi&s;dom of France, and their entire re&s;olution to re|&s;tore
the King, at the &s;ame time, exhorted him to con&s;ider that his fa|mily
was very ill with the royal family; and that he mu&s;t do more than
others to &s;ave his per&s;on and family from utter ruin: that he was much
a&s;toni&s;hed, and changed colours, and an&s;wered, It's not that that troubles
me. But, &s;aid he, I find that the duke of Hamilton plainly de&s;igns
to be our King; and before he get the crown, I will be the fir&s;t
with my kindred that will join the French, and draw my &s;word for
your prince. My lord Lovat wi&s;hed that he would continue tho&s;e re|&s;olutions.</P>
<P>Argyle a&s;ked Lovat, if captain Murray, Abercairny's &s;on, had any
commi&s;&s;ion from France; becau&s;e they were told, that he came over
with him, with commi&s;&s;ions as a French emi&s;&s;ary. My lord Lovat told
him, that he had come over with him, and per&s;uaded him that his only
bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;ee his old dying father and his relations; and that, with
what my lord Lovat told the day before to the earl of Leven, was the only
thing that &s;aved captain Murray in Scotland; James Murray and others
having informed again&s;t him, as well as again&s;t my lord Lovat. Lovat
leaving Argyle very melancholy, took leave of him. Argyle embraced
him, and told him he mu&s;t be of their party; and that he would work
with the commi&s;&s;ioner to that effect. But, at the &s;ame time, he took &s;o
to heart what my lord Lovat had told him, that the very next day he
fell dangerou&s;ly ill, and never recovered it.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat pur&s;ued his journey to the Highlands, where they were
overjoyed to &s;ee him, becau&s;e they believed him dead; having been
fourteen months in France, without writing any word to his country.
They came from all corners to &s;ee him. He &s;hewed them the King's
in&s;tructions, and the King of France's great promi&s;es. They were ra|vi&s;hed
to &s;ee them, and prayed to God to have their King there, and
they &s;hould &s;oon put him on the throne. My lord Lovat told them,
<PB N="646" REF="678">
that they mu&s;t fir&s;t fight for him, and beat his enemies in the kingdom.
They an&s;wered him, that, if they got the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he promi&s;ed them,
they would march in three days adverti&s;ement, and beat all the King's
enemies in the kingdom. At the &s;ame time, my lord Lovat received an
expre&s;s from lord Drummond and captain Murray, to acquaint him, that his
enemies had obtained an act of the privy council of fire and &s;word again&s;t
his per&s;on; and that all the troops in the kingdom had orders to take him,
dead or alive; and that the King's friends begged of him to retire his
per&s;on, which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the King, to &s;ome private place out of
the kingdom, till the King's affairs were ripe. He an&s;wered them, by
another expre&s;s, that he mocked very much what the council could do
again&s;t him; and that he was more in &s;afety among the Highlanders, as
the council was within the town of Edinburgh; and that he would pur|&s;ue
his ma&s;ter's bu&s;ine&s;s without any fear; for which rea&s;on he &s;ent for
captain Murray to &s;ee how unanimou&s;ly the Highlanders were to take
arms for their King. Captain Murray came and &s;aw the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able
of the chiefs, and was ravi&s;hed to &s;ee them &s;o re&s;olute for their
King. He told my lord Lovat, that all the low country were well re|&s;olved
for the King; and that the duke of Hamilton had not refu&s;ed
the King's commi&s;&s;ion: but that he de&s;ired him to delay matters too
much; &s;o that the King's friends were very jealous of him. He told
him likewi&s;e, that all the King's friends had re&s;olved to &s;end my lord
Drummond to France, as commi&s;&s;ioner from the low country nobility,
with the chief of a clan, as commi&s;&s;ioner from the Highlanders, to a&s;&s;ure
the King, their ma&s;ter, and the King of France, how much they were
ready to hazard their lives and fortunes for the King their ma&s;ter, and
for the King of France, if they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by them. Upon which,
my lord Lovat obliged the laird of Appin, as commi&s;&s;ioner for the re&s;t
of the Highlanders, to meet with my lord Drummond at his hou&s;e, to
conclude of affairs.</P>
<P>The day appointed for the meeting my lord Lovat, with the &s;aid com|mi&s;&s;ioner,
and the laird of Lochiel and other con&s;iderable chiefs, came
to the ca&s;tle of Drummond, and met my lord Drummond and the laird
of Abercairny, captain Murray's brother, the head of a good family,
and very much re&s;pected in that country, and one of the loyale&s;t men
in the world. He repre&s;ented the low country, together with my lord
<PB N="647" REF="679">
Drummond. They kept council together there for three days; and,
after &s;everal di&s;putes and con&s;iderations, it was re&s;olved, that my lord
Drummond and the other commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould not go immediately to
France; becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible that they could be out of the king|dom
but the government mu&s;t know it; becau&s;e many &s;poke already,
that the Highlanders were to ri&s;e in arms for King James the Eighth;
and that, as &s;oon as it was known that my lord Drummond was in
France, his e&s;tate would be forfeited, which would be hurtful to the
King's intere&s;t. But they determined to &s;end my lord Lovat immediately,
becau&s;e he had no more to lo&s;e, his e&s;tate being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his enemies,
when he was the la&s;t year in France, and becau&s;e he had the happine&s;s
to have friends, and to be known at the court of France; that he was
more capable to give account of affairs; and that he was the only man
that the Highlanders would tru&s;t to make conditions for them. My lord
Lovat, that might have &s;aved his e&s;tate and family, by &s;taying in the
country, and &s;eeing that if any accident did happen to him on the road,
his family was extinct, had much trouble of mind to re&s;olve to make
the journey: but, &s;eeing that his ma&s;ter's affairs mu&s;t have &s;uffered
much, and that he mu&s;t have failed in his engagements in France, he
re&s;olved to return with their commi&s;&s;ion to give account of affairs, or to
die by the road. Upon which, he was &s;ent away, with his cou&s;in, cap|tain
Fra&s;er, who was with him all the time, with letters to the Queen,
the marquis de Torcy, and to the Nuncio, from my lord Drummond,
the laird of Appin, as commi&s;&s;ioner from the re&s;t of the chiefs, and
from captain Murray. It was likewi&s;e re&s;olved, that captain Murray
&s;hould &s;tay for a little time, to go with my lord Drummond to a part of
the low country, where he had not been before, to bring marks with
him of their re&s;olutions to ri&s;e in arms for their King; and that, as &s;oon
as he came back to his father's hou&s;e, he &s;hould come immediately to
France, with a &s;on of one of the chiefs of the clans, to confirm what my
lord Lovat &s;hould &s;ay in their name.</P>
<P>At that time, my lord Drummond, with the laird of Appin, &s;hould
come to London, and there wait the King's orders, if it was nece&s;&s;ary
that they &s;hould come to confirm what Lovat and captain Murray &s;aid in
name of the kingdom. My lord Lovat, who &s;pent already much of his
own money, borrowed four hundred pounds from lord Drummond and
<PB N="648" REF="680">
the earl of Leven, and took journey with his di&s;patches. The com|mi&s;&s;ioner,
who had &s;till hopes to gain him to his party, &s;ent him his pa&s;&s;|port
&s;ome time before, to come into Edinburgh. He made u&s;e of it,
on this occa&s;ion, and came in and &s;aw the commi&s;&s;ioner, and gave him
very fair language; &s;o that he gave him his pa&s;&s;port to come to London,
to receive what he had offered him, in the name of the prince&s;s of Den|mark.
Though he neither tru&s;ted him nor his pa&s;&s;port, he was glad to
have it, in ca&s;e he met with &s;ome of the troops on the road. Having
&s;taid &s;ome days at Edinburgh, being tender, he rode, in the night-time,
through Scotland and the north of England, till he came to Durham,
where he &s;taid &s;ome days with the King's friends, who confirmed what
they had &s;aid before he went to Scotland. He was forced to buy fre&s;h
hor&s;es there to carry him to London, becau&s;e he dur&s;t not take coach or
po&s;t for fear to be known.</P>
<P>In &s;even days after, he arrived &s;afe in London, where he found ex|treme
difficulties in leaving England; no man, woman, or child being
&s;uffered to go to Holland, without Nottingham's pa&s;s. He had no ways
to procure it, but by Queen&s;berry, which obliged him to hazard to go
and &s;ee him privately. Queen&s;berry received him kindly. He told his
Grace that, in honour, he mu&s;t go back to France: but, as &s;oon as he gave
account of his journey, he would return and accept of his e&s;tate and the
offers his Grace made him: that, therefore, he begged of his Grace to
procure him Nottingham's pa&s;s to go to Holland, &s;ince there was no|body
that could go without it. He an&s;wered, that he was very &s;orry,
that he was re&s;olved to go back to France: that he could not have &s;uch
an occa&s;ion of e&s;tabli&s;hing his family; and that he could not give him
the &s;ame offer, though he &s;hould come again. However, he told him,
that he mu&s;t go back, though he &s;hould never get either of them.
The duke then told him, that he could not get him a pa&s;s in his own
name, becau&s;e he was declared a rebel: but that he would endeavour
to get a pa&s;s in an unknown name; and that he would &s;end it to him
the next day. My lord Lovat thanked him very kindly, and then took
leave of him. Yet the duke regretted that my lord Lovat did not em|brace
their party.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat went, that very night, to Grave&s;end, being afraid to &s;tay
any longer in London, all his enemies being there. He left orders with his
<PB N="649" REF="681">
landlord to follow him with the pa&s;s, next day, which he did; and, by
that means he went &s;afely a &s;hip board. In two days, with a favour|able
wind, he arrived in Rotterdam, where he was forced to &s;tay fifteen
days to wait his bills of exchange, which &s;hould come by the common
packet-boat; and though all that time he informed him&s;elf how he
might get &s;afe into Flanders, yet he found it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to leave
that country without the States pa&s;s. He met Mr. Delaval there, and
&s;ent him and others to the Hague to offer money for a pa&s;s; but could
not obtain it by any means. This &s;tay, that he was obliged to make at
Rotterdam, did give him occa&s;ion to do con&s;iderable &s;ervice to the King,
by gaining &s;everal of the Scots officers of his friends and relations, who
were going to Scotland to make recruits. They &s;wore faithfully to him,
that they would join the King's banner, whenever he &s;hould have any
army in the country; and &s;ome of them promi&s;ed to let down their com|mi&s;&s;ion
and live at home to wait for that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>His bills having come, and having de&s;paired of a pa&s;s, he ventured
to go to the Bo&s;h, a frontier town, where &s;ome of his friends lay in gar|ri&s;on;
hoping that they might a&s;&s;i&s;t him in getting out of that country.
He no &s;ooner arrived there, but &s;ome of his kin&s;men that were there
knew him, and above a hundred of them having come to his lodgings
next morning, to tell him that they would follow him wherever he went,
the report &s;pread through all the town, that he was come there to de|bo&s;h
the garri&s;on to the French. He, finding the great danger he
was in by that report, re&s;olved to leave the town that afternoon. He,
accordingly, &s;lipt out in the evening, and gave twenty pi&s;toles to a guide,
that furni&s;hed a hor&s;e for him&s;elf, and two hor&s;es for my lord Lovat and
his brother, and engaged to conduct them &s;afe, that night, to Antwerp.
My lord Lovat, leaving captain Fra&s;er and his page behind, ventured
with his brother and that guide to ride the fifteen leagues to Ant|werp
all night, which he did, and mi&s;&s;ed narrowly a Dutch party who
were within pi&s;tol-&s;hot of him, on the Spani&s;h territories. But their
noi&s;e having adverti&s;ed them, he galloped a league off the high-road,
through the moor; and arrived, by &s;even o'clock in the morning, at
Antwerp, where he met with the Mare&s;chal de Villeroy, who was very
civil to him, and directed him to go &s;afe into France; where he is
<PB N="650" REF="682">
happily arrived, to give this account of his journey, and of the affairs
of his country, to your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat forgot to give an account, that, about two days
after he came to the country, he &s;ent his cou&s;in-german, Sir John
M'Lean's brother with a letter to the earl of Breadalbin, concerning
the King's affairs. He returned him an&s;wer, by the &s;ame bearer, that he
was always loyal, and that he would live and die &s;o; but that he would
not tru&s;t him&s;elf to any man in the kingdom, on &s;uch great concerns,
except to my lord Lovat; &s;o that, if he plea&s;ed to come di&s;gui&s;ed to his
hou&s;e at Ballach, he would be free with him upon that &s;ubject. Though
the journey was very dangerous, yet my lord Lovat, knowing that the
earl of Breadalbin was of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the King's affairs,
he hazarded his life very de&s;perately, in going in di&s;gui&s;e through my
lord Athol's land, to the earl's hou&s;e at Ballach, where we had long con|ferences
with him; and, after many difficulties, he at la&s;t per&s;uaded him
&s;o much to embrace the King's intere&s;t, that he is re&s;olved to obey their
Maje&s;ties orders, and to hazard his grey hairs in the field for his ma&s;ter.
He likewi&s;e, after a va&s;t difficulty, per&s;uaded him to &s;ee my lord Drum|mond
and captain Murray, upon the &s;ame head.</P>
<P>My lord Lovat likewi&s;e forgot to give an account, that in Scotland
he gained &s;everal officers of his relations, that are in the &s;tanding forces,
who promi&s;ed faithfully to him, to come off and join the King's banner,
whenever he did appear in Scotland.</P>

<P>I told my good friend, the Nuncio, of the favour I a&s;ked of your

<P>&startq;I Have the honour to &s;end you the account which lord Lovat has
given to the Queen. The original is written with his own hand,
and &s;igned with his name; and I venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that the tran&s;la|tion
is exact, and even literal. I doubt not but you will be as much
&s;urpri&s;ed at it as we have been: for, although you know I never had a
good opinion of him; yet I did not believe him fool enough to accu&s;e
him&s;elf. The informations given again&s;t him, by others, are out of the
que&s;tion; and it is unnece&s;&s;ary to fatigue you with an infinite number of
remarks, becau&s;e every thing is explained in his own memorial. He has
not, in &s;ome places, been as careful as authors of romances, to pre&s;erve
probability. For, be&s;ides the vanity which runs through the whole, as
if he him&s;elf were the fir&s;t man in the world, he begins with a &s;tory at
Durham, which is totally fal&s;e. He acknowledges plainly a formal di&s;|obedience:
for he was ab&s;olutely forbidden to treat with any, but the
Highlanders; and only with &s;uch among them as had &s;ent him.</P>
<P>He told me, that Queen&s;berry, Argyle, and Leven, were the greate&s;t
enemies of the King, my ma&s;ter, in that country; yet he communicated
to them the whole of his commi&s;&s;ion, which is a crime that de&s;erves
hanging in every country. He rejects extraordinary offers; but obtains
a pa&s;s to go to London, and from thence the &s;ame Queen&s;berry obtains
another pa&s;s for him, under a borrowed name, to &s;ecure his &s;afe return
to France. This is very true: for he has produced them. It is, therefore,
clear as day-light, that the&s;e noblemen wanted to employ him here as a
&s;py, and for &s;eizing letters and commi&s;&s;ions, which might &s;erve as proofs
again&s;t the men of honour in that country. You will be plea&s;ed to ob|&s;erve,
Sir, that, in his own report, he makes every one a&s;k commi&s;&s;ions,
in order that he might obtain now what was refu&s;ed to him la&s;t year.
He accu&s;es none, but James Murray, who is a man of &s;uch known pro|bity,
that my lord Arran called for him as a man in whom he could
<PB N="653" REF="685">
place the greate&s;t confidence: but fore&s;eeing that Mr. Murray's account
would not be favourable to him, he cho&s;e to be before hand with him.</P>
<P>If the King thinks proper to apprehend him, it &s;hould be done with|out
noi&s;e. His name &s;hould not be mentioned any more; and, at the
&s;ame time, all his papers &s;hould be &s;eized. He has a companion called
Fra&s;er, who has attended him every where. I know nothing more about
him.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;I Could not &s;end your Eminence &s;ooner this report, becau&s;e a tran&s;la|tion
of it was not fini&s;hed till this day. I have the honour of com|municating
to you likewi&s;e a copy of the que&s;tions, which I have given
to Mon&s;ieur de Torcy. If there is any thing to be added, or any thing

<P>Fra&s;er,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original.</NOTE> who took to him&s;elf the title of lord Lovat, wrote a long let|ter

afflicted, he &s;aid, with the gravel, and the queen's &s;u&s;picions of his con|duct
added to his di&s;temper. &startq;If it is per&s;onal virtues,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;that
are only e&s;teemed, and not &s;ervices, if her Maje&s;ty, before &s;he believed

will find, that I never was given to any vice, and that what my
enemies &s;aid of me was a de&s;igned and intere&s;ted calumny.&endq; He then
repeated his having been &s;ent to France with a commi&s;&s;ion from the
Highlanders, and his having rejected the offers of good po&s;ts in the go|vernment,
and re&s;titution of his whole e&s;tate, in ca&s;e he would abandon
the cau&s;e, in which he was determined to per&s;evere to his death, though
he endangered &startq;the entire entinction of his family, there being none to
repre&s;ent it but his brother and him&s;elf, who were expo&s;ed to the daily

<P>&startq;I Was troubled, that I had not any an&s;wer from your lord&s;hip by ma|jor

your lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed to &s;end it. This makes me &s;end major Fra&s;er
expre&s;s to carry me your lord&s;hip's orders. I am daily informed, that the
Queen has but a &s;curvy opinion of me, and that I rather did her Ma|je&s;ty
bad than good &s;ervice by my journey. My lord, I find by that,
that my enemies have greater power with the Queen than I can have;
and, to plea&s;e them and ea&s;e her Maje&s;ty, I am re&s;olved to meddle no
more with any affairs, till the King is of age. This is leaving the field,
with a fair victory to my enemies. But I am &s;ure the King's &s;ervice will

hope or expect, by this victory, which they have &s;o long wrought for.</P>
<P>I have written the inclo&s;ed to the Queen, as my candid vindication of
what is pa&s;&s;ed, and my rea&s;ons to meddle no more. I beg your lord&s;hip

lord&s;hip read it to her Maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>It is true, your lord&s;hip may think my friend&s;hip will be but of little

<P>&startq;AS I was &s;till per&s;uaded, that your lord&s;hip has more honour and
good &s;en&s;e than to offer to ruin the reputation of a man, who
has &s;uffered a great deal for the King, and who&s;e family your lord&s;hip
knows was always loyal, &s;o much that never a lord Lovat appeared
again&s;t the royal family, though I be the twenty-&s;econd, from father to

<HEAD TYPE="sub">&startq;QUESTIONS and ANSWERS.&endq;</HEAD>
<P>&startq;QUESTION I. LORD Lovat was a&s;ked the names of the Catholics,
whom he &s;aw at Durham, and particularly of that
Iri&s;h lord, who engaged to rai&s;e five thou&s;and men, in his country, for
the &s;ervice of the King of England?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="657" REF="689">
&startq;ANSWER. He an&s;wered, that he is ready to tell their names to the
Queen: but that they exacted from him, to a&s;k her Maje&s;ty's royal
word, that &s;he would not tell them to any one. With regard to the
Iri&s;h lord, that he did not &s;ay that it was in his power to rai&s;e five thou|&s;and
men: but that there were in Ireland five thou&s;and Catholics ready
to take arms for their King, whenever they &s;hould be &s;ent to them;
and that he was ready to go to Ireland to prepare them for that pur|po&s;e.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;With regard to his an&s;wer to the fir&s;t que&s;tion, the mini&s;ters of the
court of St. Germains remark, that, in an audience he had of the Queen,
and in &s;everal letters which he wrote to her, he made no mention of this
&s;ecrecy about names, which he now pretends to have been required of
him; and that it is ab&s;olutely incredible that all the Roman Catholic
gentlemen of a county, in which they are obliged to ob&s;erve &s;o many
precautions, &s;hould venture to a&s;&s;emble, and to &s;end four deputies to
lord Lovat, when they were not acquainted with him but as a pa&s;&s;enger,
and could not know but from him&s;elf whether he was a Roman Catholic
or not; and that they &s;hould be &s;o inexcu&s;ably imprudent, as to tru&s;t
them&s;elves &s;o publickly to the di&s;cretion of a man who was an ab&s;olute
&s;tranger to them; while, at the &s;ame time, they were &s;o ab&s;urdly cau|tious,
as to di&s;tru&s;t the queen's council, and to exact from her Maje&s;ty,
on her royal word, that &s;he &s;hould not tell their names to any one.</P>
<P>With regard to the Iri&s;h lord, the que&s;tion is not whether it was actu|ally
in his power to rai&s;e five thou&s;and men; but whether lord Lovat
&s;aid, in his narrative, that he had engaged to rai&s;e them. Now here are
the very words of his own narrative, with which he may be confronted
at any time. He po&s;itively affirmed, &startq;that this Iri&s;h lord,&endq; who&s;e name
we are not allowed to know, &startq;had charged him to tell to the Queen of
England, and to the court of France, that if arms were &s;ent to Ireland,
he would engage his life and his fortune, that he would find there five
thou&s;and men who would take arms for the &s;ervice of his Britannic Ma|je&s;ty.&endq;
They leave the French mini&s;try and the nuncio to judge, if a
man does not &s;ay, &startq;that he engages him&s;elf,&endq; when he &s;ays, &startq;that he
engages his life and fortune.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="658" REF="690">
&startq;QUESTION II. He was a&s;ked, if he believed that the earls of Argyle
and Leven, and the duke of Queen&s;berry, were well or ill-affected to his
Britannic Maje&s;ty?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;ANSWER. He an&s;wered, that the&s;e noblemen, of whom one is dead,
were, are, and will be, for or again&s;t the King of England, as they find
their intere&s;t in it.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;This an&s;wer is vague and delu&s;ive, Lord Lovat dared not own
plainly (what, however, is very true) that the&s;e noblemen are very ill-affected
to his Britannic Maje&s;ty, becau&s;e that he would &s;ub&s;cribe thereby
to his own condemnation, for having had &s;uch an intimate corre&s;pond|ence
with them without orders; and, on the other hand, he dared not
&s;ay that they were well affected, becau&s;e he would be contradicted, by
what is publickly known, and would likewi&s;e contradict him&s;elf: for
he owned to the Queen, that the&s;e noblemen were enemies to the King
her &s;on, which is very different from his ambiguous an&s;wer to the que&s;|tion
that was put to him. Now the&s;e ambiguities and contradictions are
not incident to tho&s;e who adhere to truth.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;QUESTION III. He was a&s;ked whether he communicated to the&s;e
three lords what he &s;hould have carefully concealed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;ANSWER. He an&s;wered, that he told them nothing which he &s;hould
have concealed from them: but that, on the contrary, all that he told
them tended to conceal his real de&s;ign; having &s;aid nothing to them, but
what had been fir&s;t concerted with the principal friends of the King, his
ma&s;ter, as he hath mo&s;t fully explained already.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;The mini&s;try of the court of St. Germains ob&s;erve, that the rever&s;e
of this appears evident from Lovat's own narrative. Lord Leven came
to him from the duke of Queen&s;berry, before he could have concerted
that meeting with the King's friends. They had only his own word to
oppo&s;e to all the pre&s;umptions again&s;t him, that he did not accept of the
offers, which were made to him. He was &s;ent to the Highlanders, and
&s;hould have treated with them only; whereas, his fir&s;t conferences in
Scotland were with his Maje&s;ty's greate&s;t enemies. They then quote his
own words to the earls of Leven and Argyle, and to the duke of Queen&s;|berry,
as expre&s;&s;ed in his memorial to the Queen. They make many
<PB N="659" REF="691">
pertinent remarks upon them; and conclude with ob&s;erving, that &startq;&s;uch
di&s;cour&s;es &s;hould naturally have induced the duke of Queen&s;berry to ar|re&s;t
him, in&s;tead of allowing him to go away, if he had had no better
a&s;&s;urances from him; yet the contrary happens: for, not &s;atisfied with leav|ing
him at liberty to go away, he a&s;&s;i&s;ts him to leave the kingdom, which
gives room to conclude, that, according to all appearances, lord Lovat di&s;|covered
and promi&s;ed to the&s;e noblemen more than he acknowledges here,
otherwi&s;e they never would have pre&s;umed to encourage him &s;o far, or in|clined
to furni&s;h him with money and pa&s;&s;ports to facilitate his return to
France.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;QUESTION IV. He was a&s;ked, what &s;ervices the&s;e lords required
of him to de&s;erve rewards &s;o con&s;iderable, as tho&s;e which were offered
to him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;ANSWER. That they made the&s;e offers to him, without exacting any
other conditions from him, to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the ju&s;t apprehen|&s;ions,
with which James Murray had filled them, that he, Lovat, would
put him&s;elf at the head of the Highlanders, with the other chiefs, his
relations and friends, and carry all the re&s;t of Scotland along with them.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;The mini&s;try remark, that the&s;e lords knew Lovat too well to fear
him; and that their characters are too well known to be &s;u&s;pected of
having made &s;uch offers to him, without exacting any return. They
confute what is laid to the charge of James Murray, from his known
character of prudence, honour, and loyalty. James Murray was then at
St. Germains, and prote&s;ted to the Queen, not only that he did not
&s;peak to the&s;e three noblemen while he was in Scotland, but that he never
filled them nor any other with a fear of lord Lovat; and that he was a&s;|&s;ured,
by a man who knew the &s;tate of the country and de&s;erved to be
credited, that Lovat was &s;o far from having the power which he pre|tended
in the Highlands, that he could not now rai&s;e fifty men of his
own clan.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;QUESTION V. He was a&s;ked, &s;ince he had rejected their offers, by
declaring his inviolable attachment to their enemies, by what motive was
he able to engage them to protect him; and to furni&s;h him money and
pa&s;&s;ports to &s;ecure his return to France?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;ANSWER. He an&s;wered, by motives of the old friend&s;hips, which
they had always for him, to &s;uch a degree as to furni&s;h him with a retreat
<PB N="660" REF="692">
and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for &s;ix or &s;even years, when he was pro&s;cribed for having
taken arms for the &s;ervice of the late King; and becau&s;e they, as well
as he, are the enemies of the earl of Athol.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;The mini&s;try make many remarks on the improbability of &s;uppo&s;ing
that the&s;e noblemen, whom Lovat him&s;elf repre&s;ents in his memorial as
very &s;elfi&s;h, could be carried to &s;uch lengths by their friend&s;hip for him.
They were at the head of the government in Scotland, when he was con|demned
for an atrocious crime, as he pretends. They did not protect
him then, as they had not probably the &s;ame motives of friend&s;hip to
him they have now. Lovat did not take up arms for the late King of
England, unle&s;s, by the late King of England, he meant the late prince
of Orange, who made him a captain in lord Athol's regiment.</P>
<P>&startq;QUESTION VI. He was a&s;ked, if he de&s;igned to remain here or to
return?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;ANSWER. He an&s;wered, that he came back to offer, in the name
of the principal men in Scotland, both in the Highlands and in the low
country, to take the field with an army for the &s;ervice of his King, and
to return to expo&s;e his life with them for his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>The mini&s;try remark, that he brought no proofs of his having been
employed to make the&s;e offers, but letters of recommendation in very
general terms, from lord Drummond, a Highland gentleman, and captain
John Murray, dated in the month of October, that is to &s;ay, two months
before the di&s;covery of the con&s;piracy. &startq;But to an&s;wer more properly
to the que&s;tion,&endq; they ob&s;erve, &startq;he &s;hould have &s;aid, that his de&s;ign
was to remain here, until he obtained the &s;uccours nece&s;&s;ary for his en|terpri&s;e:
for if he had no need of &s;uccours, why did he return? He
&s;hould have remained in the country and carried on his projects, &s;ince
he could di&s;po&s;e of Scotland him&s;elf, and of Ireland, by means of his
powerful friend at Durham. He did wrong, to delay the plea&s;ure which
we &s;hould have received from this.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;QUESTION VII. He was a&s;ked, why he di&s;obeyed the orders which
he had, not to &s;peak but to the Highlanders who had &s;ent him?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="661" REF="693">
&startq;ANSWER. He an&s;wered, that he did not &s;peak at fir&s;t of his real
de&s;ign, but to tho&s;e who had &s;ent him: but that, as they had drawn
over &s;everal of the principal noblemen of the low country to the King of
England's party, and as, among the&s;e noblemen, there are &s;ome who
have lands in the Highlands, he could not and he ought not to have
avoided to confer with them, conjointly with his old friends and the &s;er|vants
of the King their ma&s;ter, by who&s;e advice he conducted him&s;elf in
all he did.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;It is but too evident, though in a very different &s;en&s;e from that in
which lord Lovat would chu&s;e that we &s;hould under&s;tand him, that he
did not &s;peak of his real de&s;ign, but to his old friends, who had &s;ent
him. But to hear him &s;peak of his old friends, would not one be apt to
&s;ay that he was fifty years of age; yet he acknowledges him&s;elf that he
has been at college after the revolution; therefore, his ancient friend|&s;hips,
of which he boa&s;ts &s;o much, did not commence but after the re|bellion,
and with men who were then declared rebels; and it is not diffi|cult
to gue&s;s, by what means he has de&s;erved their e&s;teem. It is always
a very great prejudice again&s;t a man, that he acknowledges for his be&s;t
friends the greate&s;t enemies of the King his ma&s;ter; and to allege that
friend&s;hip, in his ju&s;tification, is a pitiful defence.&endq; They make &s;eve|ral
other remarks, on his di&s;obeying his orders, not to confer with any
but the Highlanders.</P>
<P>&startq;QUESTION VIII. He was a&s;ked the names of the Highlanders with
whom he treated?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;ANSWER. He an&s;wered, that he had no power from them to tell
them, but to the Queen upon her royal word, not to name them to her
council; becau&s;e they had experienced how little the&s;e regard &s;ecrecy,
and how much they them&s;elves have &s;uffered thereby.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Remarks.</HEAD>
<P>The mini&s;try deny this charge, which Lovat had more than once re|peated
again&s;t them; and they conclude with remarking, &startq;That it is a
proof of his impudence, rather than of his innocence, if he pre&s;umes to
remain longer in France. He flatters him&s;elf, that he will obtain here
all he wants. He knows, that if he returns empty handed, he will not
<PB N="662" REF="694">
be well received by his old friends: for he is convinced, that their pro|mi&s;es

<HEAD>1.&startq;A copy of what the &s;ieur James Murray has declared to the Queen
of England concerning lord Lovat, &s;ent to the marquis de Torcy, the 22d
February, 1704.&endq;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tran&s;lation.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;The Sieur James Murray, lately arrived from Scotland, has declared
to the Queen, and given under his hand and &s;eal the following particulars
concerning the Sieur Beaufort, commonly called lord Lovat.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I Remember, that &s;oon after the arrival of Beaufort<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lovat.</NOTE> in Scot|land,
the late earl of Argyle went towards the borders of England,
under pretence of going to a country-hou&s;e which he has near Newca&s;tle.
But I am a&s;&s;uredly informed, by men who de&s;erve to be credited, that he
did not go &s;o far, and that he was only at &s;ome place in that neighbour|hood,
where Beaufort waited for him, and where they &s;taid together &s;ome
days. The parliament being then prorogued for eight days, on account
of a meeting which the deputies of the boroughs were to hold at Glaf|gow,
that they returned together to Edinburgh, where Beaufort was in|troduced
to the duke of Queen&s;berry; and that his Grace gave him a
pa&s;s to the Highlands, to treat with the chieftains about their taking
arms. In fact, &s;ome of tho&s;e with whom Beaufort treated, were di&s;|covered;
and, before I left Scotland, there was an order to apprehend
lord Drummond and Appin, and &s;everal others were &s;ummoned to ap|pear
before the council.</P>
<P>It is well known in Scotland, that the duke of Queen&s;berry gave to
Mr. M'Leod, a lieutenant of the Scotch guards of the prince&s;s of Den|mark,
bills upon the bank of Scotland for 400<HI>l.</HI> &s;terling: that the&s;e
bills were carried to the bank; and that Mr. M'Leod received a hundred
guineas from one of the tellers, and two hundred from another; and
that he declared to the council, and &s;igned his declaration, that he gave
that &s;um and the re&s;t of the bills to Beaufort, by order of the duke of
Queen&s;berry. The &s;aid Mr. M'Leod declared al&s;o, that Beaufort had
told him, that Mr. James Murray was &s;ent from St. Germains to treat
with the duke of Hamilton and his party, which is commonly called in
Scotland the country party; and that he was to return to St. Germains
&s;oon; and that the Queen of England had &s;ent three letters to Scotland,
<PB N="664" REF="696">
by Mr. Jo. Murray, who came from France along with him; one to the
duke of Gordon, another to the counte&s;s of Errol, and a third to a
per&s;on who&s;e name M'Leod &s;ays Beaufort had told him, but which he
has forgot. All the&s;e declarations of M'Leod's are regi&s;tered in the
records of the Scotch council.</P>
<P>It is certain, for I have been informed of it by good authority, that
the earls of Argyle and Leven &s;aid, that Beaufort told them, that be|fore
he could engage the court of St. Germains to enter into his pro|jects,
he was obliged to make him&s;elf a Roman Catholic; after which
they li&s;tened to all his propo&s;als, by the means of the duke of Perth and
father Saunders.</P>
<P>I am a&s;&s;ured likewi&s;e, that Beaufort told in Scotland, that there was
one of the name of M'Kenzie in France, who di&s;concerted all his &s;chemes;
and, before he could &s;ucceed in what he propo&s;ed at Ver&s;ailles and St.
Germains, he was obliged to contrive to have him put into the Ba&s;tile.</P>
<P>Men who de&s;erve to be credited, who were upon the &s;pot, and who had
an intere&s;t to know every thing, wrote from London to a nobleman of
the fir&s;t rank in Scotland, when I was there, that the duke of Queen&s;|berry,
in an audience which he had of the prince&s;s of Denmark, had ac|knowledged,
in the pre&s;ence of the earl of Athol, that he had given a
pa&s;s to Beaufort to go to the Highlands of Scotland to treat with the
chieftains; and that he had the permi&s;&s;ion of the prince&s;s of Denmark to
do &s;o, which &s;he acknowledged; and that his Grace had &s;aid al&s;o, that he
had procured a pa&s;s for Beaufort to leave England; and that he did &s;o
to give him an opportunity of rendering them greater &s;ervices.</P>
<P>It is certain that there was a letter from Beaufort to the duke of
Queen&s;berry intercepted by lord Athol, in which Beaufort acknowledged
all the duke's favours, and promi&s;ed to continue to &s;erve him.</P>
<P>Mr. Campbel of Glenderuel, when he was examined, declared, that he
gave another letter from Beaufort to the duke of Queen&s;berry; and,
upon the duke's denying to have received that letter, Campbel, who per|&s;i&s;ted
to maintain that he had given it, added, that he could &s;till &s;how
the letter which Beaufort wrote to him, and in which the duke's letter
was inclo&s;ed. But, as the duke was not willing to produce that letter,
the contents of it could not be known.</P>
<P><PB N="665" REF="697">
I had an opportunity of conver&s;ing about Beaufort with one Adam|&s;on,
known to be a very hone&s;t man, who has &s;uffered much for his
loyalty, and who is now receiver and manager of the e&s;tate of Lovat
for the lady, who is the heire&s;s and elde&s;t daughter of the late lord
Lovat. This man, who is perfectly acquainted with that country, a&s;|&s;ured
me, that Beaufort had now &s;o little influence there, that, excepting
forty or fifty adventurers, men like him&s;elf, ready for any undertaking,
becau&s;e they had little or nothing to lo&s;e, he would not find one High|lander,
even of his own clan, who would willingly follow him.</P>
<P>In fine, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the friends of the King my ma&s;ter,
in the low country of Scotland, with whom I had the honour of con|ver&s;ing,
and who&s;e &s;entiments I had an opportunity of knowing, con&s;ider
Beaufort to be a man &s;o wicked, &s;o dangerous, and &s;o notoriou&s;ly to be
&s;u&s;pected, that they will be much a&s;toni&s;hed, if he is not puni&s;hed in
France, where they cannot apprehend how he has ventured to return,
after the manner in which he conducted him&s;elf in Scotland; and, in
&s;hort, they are per&s;uaded, that when his real character, his conduct, and
his little influence in Scotland, where he is outlawed for dete&s;table crimes,
are a little known at St. Germains, they will take care not to &s;end back
&s;uch an emi&s;&s;ary as will ruin the affairs of his Britannie Maje&s;ty in that
country, by di&s;obliging his firme&s;t friends, and tho&s;e whom it is mo&s;t his in|tere&s;t
to manage, and who certainly will never choo&s;e to expo&s;e them&s;elves
to treat about any affair with the court of St. Germains, while they &s;u&s;|pect
that that court can place any confidence in Beaufort, whom they
con&s;ider as a man capable of betraying and ruining them.</P>

<P>&startq;The Sieur James Murray who is come back from Scotland, where
he had been &s;ent back with in&s;tructions to the earl of Arran and &s;everal
other noblemen, and others of his Maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ubjects in that
country, has given the Queen, in their name, the following narrative.&endq;</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Tran&s;lation.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;THE earl of Arran, at the expence of great attentions, a good deal
of intrigue and application, and large &s;ums of money, which he
laid out during the &s;itting of the la&s;t parliament of Scotland, managed
matters &s;o properly, as to gain among them a party &s;trong enough for
di&s;concerting the principal de&s;igns of the court, e&s;pecially with regard to
the three chief articles, which I was charged, by my in&s;tructions, to recom|mend
to him; namely, to hinder the parliament from con&s;enting to the
union of the two kingdoms, the abjuration of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, and
the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the line of Hannover. It was by the&s;e
means, that the power which had been given to the commi&s;&s;ioners to
treat about the union was declared to be expired; that the Hannoverian
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion was rejected; and that the bill for the abjuration was not even
propo&s;ed in parliament.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, his party voted unanimou&s;ly for all the clau&s;es in the act for
the &s;ecurity of the kingdom, which was con&s;idered as a po&s;itive exclu&s;ion
of the duke of Hannover; and, when the whole act came to be con|&s;idered
for the la&s;t time, his party was &s;o powerful, that the act was
pa&s;&s;ed by a great majority of voices; and, becau&s;e the prince&s;s of Den|mark
refu&s;ed afterwards to give her con&s;ent to it, the &s;ame party hin|dered
the reading of the bill for the &s;ub&s;idy; and, thereby, obliged the
commi&s;&s;ioner to prorogue the parliament before any &s;ub&s;idy was granted.</P>
<P>The earl of Arran employed all imaginable means to oblige &s;ome of
the prince&s;s of Denmark's mini&s;ters, namely, the lords Athol and Tarbar,
and the chancellor Scafield, to enter into his mea&s;ures, with regard to
the three articles above mentioned; and he prevailed with them &s;o far,
that they re&s;olved to repre&s;ent to the prince&s;s of Denmark, that they
could never &s;erve her effectually in Scotland, unle&s;s &s;he concurred with
<PB N="667" REF="699">
them in yielding the&s;e three points. If the&s;e noblemen per&s;i&s;t in their
re&s;olution, and if the prince&s;s con&s;ents to what they &s;hall demand of her,
it is not doubted but &s;he may be prevailed upon, in time, to make &s;ome
treaty in favour of the King her brother. If &s;he does not con&s;ent, but,
on the contrary, per&s;i&s;ts in the de&s;ign of carrying the&s;e three points in
the en&s;uing parliament, then there is room to believe, that &s;he will meet
with &s;o much oppo&s;ition, and the divi&s;ions and animo&s;ities will be &s;o
great, that it will not be difficult to engage the parties, which they call
the country party, to make &s;ome declaration, or undertake &s;ome enter|prize
in favour of his Britannic Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>But, before they come to the la&s;t re&s;olution of this kind, the earl of
Arran demands to be made acquainted with the friends his Britannic
Maje&s;ty has in England, upon whom he can depend, in order that he
may concert with them, and that they may conde&s;cend together, upon
the &s;uccours that will be nece&s;&s;ary for them.</P>
<P>He has given me in charge to tell, that the parliament of Scotland
will meet again in the month of April next, or in the month of May
at farthe&s;t; and that, if the prince&s;s of Denmark de&s;igns, as it is be|lieved
&s;he does, to engage the Scots in the &s;ame mea&s;ures with England,
with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the abjuration, and the union, &s;he will
certainly &s;end money to be di&s;tributed among the members of parlia|ment.
Now, in order to counterbalance this, he de&s;ires, that 25,000<HI>l.</HI>
be &s;ent to him.</P>
<P>The manner in which he propo&s;es to di&s;po&s;e of this money is, to take
a &s;hare of it to him&s;elf, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to defray the great expence which
he will be obliged to make for maintaining his credit with his party; to
di&s;tribute another &s;hare of it in augmenting and &s;trengthening his party,
and in pre&s;erving and confirming tho&s;e who are already of it, according
as he &s;hall &s;ee nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ervice of his Maje&s;ty; and to employ
the re&s;t in purcha&s;ing arms. With regard to the manner of placing
this money in London, he leaves that to the di&s;cretion of his Britannic
Maje&s;ty, as well as the choice of the per&s;on to whom his Maje&s;ty may
&s;ee fit to tru&s;t it. But it is his opinion, that the tru&s;tee &s;hould be rather
a man who is unknown, than a man who is known; and, when the
money is placed, and the per&s;on who is to keep it conde&s;cended upon,
<PB N="668" REF="700">
lord Arran de&s;ires to have notice of this, and to be made acquainted
with his cant name and his addre&s;s, in order that he may write to him,
and he will write only two words to him, with which two words he hath
tru&s;ted me, and told me that the Queen of England knows them; and,
upon &s;howing the&s;e, he wi&s;hes that per&s;on may be authorized to pay
the money.</P>
<P>My lord Arran propo&s;es likewi&s;e, that, during the meeting of par|liament
in Scotland, endeavours &s;hould be made to have &s;ome troops and
&s;ome &s;hips in readine&s;s on the coa&s;t of France, in order to be at hand
in ca&s;e they come to a rupture. I had orders likewi&s;e to repre&s;ent to
his Britannic Maje&s;ty, that it is the opinion of lord Arran, that all the
enterprizes which do not &s;ucceed, tend to ruin the affairs of his Ma|je&s;ty,
and to de&s;troy his friends; and, for that rea&s;on, that nothing
&s;hould ever be undertaken, but upon good foundation, and after mat|ters
were properly concerted, and all the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures taken for
procuring &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>And this is not the opinion of my lord Arran alone, but al&s;o of all
the King's principal friends in Scotland, with whom I have &s;poken, and
who&s;e names I have given to the Queen; the archbi&s;hop of&mdash;, the
bi&s;hop of Edinburgh, the lords Panmure, Stormont, Balmerino, and
Montro&s;e. They all &s;poke to me, nearly in the &s;ame manner, on this
&s;ubject; that is to &s;ay, that an enterprize, &s;upported by powerful &s;uc|cours
from France, and well concerted with the friends of his Britannic
Maje&s;ty in England, as well as in Scotland, would find the country
greatly di&s;po&s;ed to &s;econd it: but that a precipitate and ra&s;h attempt,
in&s;tead of &s;ucceeding, would &s;erve only to ruin every thing.</P>
<P>And it is for this rea&s;on, that the earl of Arran in&s;i&s;ts much, that a
corre&s;pondence may be &s;ettled between his Britannic Maje&s;ty's friends in
the two kingdoms, in order that they may the better judge what &s;uc|cours
will be nece&s;&s;ary for them; and he offers to treat of the affairs of
the King, his ma&s;ter, with any of his Maje&s;ty's friends in England, pro|viding
they can be prevailed upon to be the fir&s;t to &s;peak about them
to him: but, until he knows what he may hope from England, he
&s;ays, that he cannot preci&s;ely determine what &s;uccours will be nece&s;&s;ary;
becau&s;e a greater or a &s;maller number will be nece&s;&s;ary, in proportion to
the number and quality of the people in England who will join him.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;I Have had the honour to write to you on the 25th of la&s;t month,
and likewi&s;e on the 13th in&s;tant; and, although I have not had the
happine&s;s of hearing from you, or from my lord Middleton, I cannot
help writing to you again, to a&s;&s;ure both you and him of my re&s;pects;
and, at the &s;ame time, to inform you of the intelligence &s;ent to me,
concerning the late Scotch plot. I am informed, that Fra&s;er of Beau|fort,
alias Lovat, has been at St. Germains; that he has been well re|ceived
by &s;ome per&s;ons there; and that he has been afterwards at Ver|&s;ailles,
where he &s;ays that he has received money, with a promi&s;e of re|ceiving
more, together with troops, when it is nece&s;&s;ary. Now, it is
<PB N="670" REF="702">
certain, that he has been &s;ent by the duke of Queen&s;berry, and that
the expence of his journey is defrayed by his Grace, in order to form
a pretended con&s;piracy again&s;t the pre&s;ent government of Scotland, and
to involve in it the dukes of Hamilton and Athol, and lord Tarbat, &s;e|cretary
of &s;tate: but his principal de&s;ign was to ruin the two fir&s;t of
the&s;e noblemen, and, above all, the duke of Athol, who is the mortal
enemy both of the duke of Queen&s;berry and of Beaufort, becau&s;e the
latter had ravi&s;hed his &s;i&s;ter in the mo&s;t infamous manner. Tho&s;e who
wi&s;h no good to the court of St. Germains, rejoice at this; and they
have rea&s;on: for nothing does greater prejudice to the &s;ervice of his
Britannic Maje&s;ty, than the reception given to &s;uch villains, who have
neither credit nor power. Believe me, there are none but villains and
beggars, and men capable of rapes, who would come with &s;uch ill-founded
projects; and &s;uch men ought to be con&s;idered as &s;pies, and be
confined in mad-hou&s;es if they are fools, and in the Ba&s;tile if they have
their &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>I gave the character of this Lovat, long ago, to madam Fox; and
I likewi&s;e gave notice of &s;everal other emi&s;&s;aries of the &s;ame character
with this man, who formerly deceived the court of St. Germains. But
they did not choo&s;e to believe me, until it was too late. I acknowledge
I am too warm when I &s;peak about Lovat; becau&s;e I know that nothing
can be more prejudicial to the intere&s;t of the King our ma&s;ter, than to give
him credit; being very certain, that he has been &s;ent to France, by the
duke of Queen&s;berry, in order to ruin his enemies in Scotland, and to
dre&s;s up a plot which might render his Grace agreeable to both kingdoms,
and give him a triumph over his enemies.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;AN Iri&s;h monk, of the name of Farrel, who e&s;caped from pri&s;on in
England, where he had been confined for eight months, took his
pa&s;&s;age on board a Dutch ve&s;&s;el to Portugal, where he arrived at the &s;ame

to Spain, where he waited of meto bring me the inclo&s;ed me&s;&s;age.
I am acquainted with father Farrel. He is a man of good &s;en&s;e, and
has been much employed by the King's friends in England.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty will &s;ee here a new confirmation of Lovat's knavery;
and, I believe, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that your Maje&s;ty &s;end a

<P>&startq;LORD Granard charged me, in the name of the duke of Hamilton
and of his party, to inform you, that one Fra&s;er, commonly
called lord Lovat, has been &s;ent to France, by the duke of Queen&s;berry,
to act there as his &s;py; and that they wi&s;h he may be apprehended, if
he is &s;till in France: for it is well known, that, before he left London,
he called upon a Mr. Clark, who is an apothecary in London, and is a

very hone&s;t man, to whom he told that he was lord Lovat, and that he
was ju&s;t arrived from St. Germains, with a commi&s;&s;ion from the King to
the duke of Hamilton; that he was afraid to carry it about him; and
that he intreated him, for that rea&s;on, to keep it in his hou&s;e till next
day. But, that very night, he &s;ent the con&s;tables to Clark's, who &s;earched
his hou&s;e, and found in a &s;ilver box, the packet, with a forged com|mi&s;&s;ion,

<P>&startq;I Could not have an&s;wered &s;ooner the letter which you did me the

becau&s;e I have but ju&s;t now learned the name of the man who

<PB N="673" REF="705">
of the King's frigate called the Ludlow, an Engli&s;h prize, now at Dun|kirk.
He knows the place where he ought to land, which is called the
ca&s;tle of Bownes, the re&s;idence of the earl of Errol, in the county of
Buchan. It will be &s;ufficient, if this ve&s;&s;el can be ready on the 10th
of the next month, with orders to &s;ail as &s;oon as they receive their di&s;|patches,
and to return immediately after they arive at the place of their
de&s;tination. To keep this &s;cout, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give him his orders
&s;ealed, with a prohibition to open them till he is at &s;ea, or to carry any
one along with him, who does not belong to the &s;hip. The Scotch
pilot, of whom I &s;peak, is called Caron, a name which would frighten
a &s;cholar; but &s;ailors do not &s;tudy the belles lettres.&endq;</P>

would be a danger in her remaining on the coa&s;t, for fear of giving
alarm: and as the place is di&s;tant from Edinburgh, an an&s;wer cannot be
expected for a long time. Therefore, if the ve&s;&s;el will go back, a month

<P>&startq;THE man called Caron, who is to go over in the brig, will only
land and deliver the packet, with which he is charged, in a
hou&s;e which is near the &s;hore, and return immediately on board, with|out
waiting for an an&s;wer. Therefore, it is only nece&s;&s;ary for the brig to
remain a few hours on the coa&s;t, to take this man on board again, and bring
him back to Dunkirk. But, in order to have an an&s;wer to the packet, it
will be &s;ufficient to return to the &s;ame place in a month thereafter, as my
lord Middleton has had the honour to ob&s;erve, in his letter ye&s;terday to

the marquis de Torcy, to whom he takes the liberty to explain him&s;elf
again, by this memorial, fearing not to have done &s;o &s;ufficiently by his
letter; becau&s;e, as he always believed that this Caron, who is a pilot,
was of the &s;hip's crew, he might imagine it was demanded, not that the
&s;hip &s;hould &s;tay to take this man again on board, but another man who
was to bring an an&s;wer to the packet.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;YOUR la&s;t gives fair hopes that Mr. Arm&s;worth [Marlborough],
who is the principal per&s;on concerned, hath renewed his pro|mi&s;es
of payment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 12.</NOTE> [of re&s;toring the Stuarts] in &s;o convincing a manner
to you, that you cannot doubt of his performance. I rely much upon
your judgment in this matter, and &s;hall always hope the be&s;t; though,
to tell you truly, I cannot well &s;ee how his promi&s;es can be much &s;tronger
or more binding now, than they were many years ago, when they proved
ineffectual, and &s;eemed in a manner forgotten. All I can &s;ay is, that I
have no other rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied of the reality of his intentions, but what
you give me in your la&s;t letters, wherein you &s;ay, that at your fir&s;t confer|ence
with him you was convinced of his upright meaning. If you receive
the &s;ame &s;atisfaction when you meet with his partner Goul&s;ton [Godol|phin],
it will give a more promi&s;ing face to this bu&s;ine&s;s; for that part|ner
is not &s;o free of his promi&s;es as Arm&s;worth [Marlborough] has been,
and con&s;equently not to be &s;o much &s;u&s;pected of non-performance.
However, no overtures ought to be neglected that are made us, of hav|ing
our debt fairly &s;ati&s;fied, without the expence and vexation of being
to&s;&s;ed about from the law to the chancery, and from thence perhaps to
the hou&s;e of lords. Their tran&s;actions with Northly [Scotland], will,
perhaps, give us &s;ome light into this matter; for if they join in intere&s;t
with Mr. Hanmer [Hannover], we may conclude their intentions are not
right towards us.</P>
<P>I know not whether you have yet received the picture I gave you
notice of in my la&s;t; the pre&s;erving it to that gentlewoman is entirely
left to your di&s;cretion, upon confidence that you will not put it into her

<P>&startq;LORD Churchill, &s;ome days before his departure for Holland,
&s;ent for me, and made me &s;o many promi&s;es, and gave me &s;o
many proofs of the re$itude of his intentions to di&s;charge the debt,
which he has acknowledged long ago to be due to your family, that I
can entertain no doubt of his &s;incerity. He appears to me to be a&s;to|ni&s;hed,
that the duke of Berwick was &s;ent to Spain, and employed at
&s;uch a di&s;tance; and he a&s;ked me how you could con&s;ent to that. I told
him, that you had written to me formerly on the &s;ubject, and that his
being employed in a po&s;t &s;o con&s;iderable, would a&s;&s;uredly be very ad|vantageous
to the common intere&s;t: but I perceived, that he believed
that he would have been more u&s;eful in the place where he was la&s;t year.
He ordered me likewi&s;e to go &s;ometimes, in his ab&s;ence, to wait of my
lord Godolphin, and to communicate to him any important intelligence
I might receive concerning you and your family.</P>
<P>Mr. Floyd is very zealous in the affairs of your family. He likewi&s;e
has waited lately on lord Churchill, and he has entreated me to acquaint
you, that his lord&s;hip had given him all the promi&s;es and a&s;&s;urances
which he could either hope or expect from him, of his intentions to pay
the debt. In &s;hort, I am daily more and more convinced of the pro|bability
of the good &s;ucce&s;s of our affairs; and the mi&s;under&s;tanding
which reigns here, between the leaders of parties, contributes not a little,
in my opinion, to give us room to hope for a favourable i&s;&s;ue.&endq;</P>

&s;how them&s;elves again&s;t it. Nor can we doubt of Mr. Serely [French

friend&s;hip to Manly [the King], and have the credit of &s;etting him up
in trade. For you remember what he did towards it, upon his father's
death, which made &s;uch a noi&s;e among the adver&s;e party; and you will
the more wonder at it, when I tell you what I certainly know, that he
made that &s;tep again&s;t the opinion of his timorous advi&s;ers [the French
mini&s;try]: and that his &s;on [the dauphin] was the only per&s;on among&s;t

<P>&startq;ON my arrival in London, I found there my nephew, Mr. Keith, a
gentleman of a family very loyal to the King of England. I
e&s;tabli&s;hed a corre&s;pondence with him. My lord Lovat, knowing that I
had &s;een him, de&s;ired to &s;ee him likewi&s;e; and, as he was well ver&s;ed in
the affairs of England, I believed that he might have been u&s;eful to the
intere&s;ts of his Maje&s;ty, both in England and in Scotland. He certainly
would have been &s;o, if he had not been betrayed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as bu&s;ine&s;s allowed me, I left London, and came as far as
Durham, with lord Lovat, where I left him, and went from thence to
Edinburgh. As &s;oon as I arrived there, I &s;ent for my brother-in-law,
Graham of Fintrey, and my uncle, James Graham, both of them men
di&s;tingui&s;hed for their loyalty. They &s;oon gave intelligence of this to the
marquis of Montro&s;e, to the earl of Errol, and to his &s;on, lord Hay;
and as I came to Scotland upon the indemnity, they advi&s;ed me to give
notice of my arrival to the lord Commi&s;&s;ioner; and they a&s;&s;ured me
that that would be of no prejudice to me. I accordingly did what they
advi&s;ed me. All this time I did not &s;peak a word of bu&s;ine&s;s; having
had orders from the commi&s;&s;ioner to keep my room: but, after &s;ome
days, both he and the chancellor &s;ent me word, that I was at liberty;
and then my friends above mentioned advi&s;ed me to vi&s;it them all, one
after another.</P>
<P>The earl and the counte&s;s of Errol, with their &s;on, lord Hay, being
then at Edinburgh, were the fir&s;t to whom I &s;poke of the affairs of the
King of England. I went, after that, to &s;ee lord Drummond, at his
country-hou&s;e, Drummond-ca&s;tle, from whence he came back with me
&s;oon to Edinburgh, to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty, after I had enjoined my two
elde&s;t brothers, in the country, by the advice of lord Drummond, to in|form
<PB N="678" REF="710">
them&s;elves of the &s;tate of affairs in that quarter, in &s;uch a way as
not to make a di&s;covery to any body.</P>
<P>Speaking at Edinburgh with the King's friends about his Maje&s;ty's
affairs, in a more &s;erious manner than I had done before, I found that
the&s;e affairs had not been mentioned among them for a long time before,
and that it was to them an agreeable &s;urpri&s;e to &s;ee &s;ome hopes that they
were to be revived by my negociation.</P>
<P>It was then judged nece&s;&s;ary to communicate the bu&s;ine&s;s to the duke
of Hamilton, who entered into it very heartily: but, as the project was
new, and other bu&s;ine&s;s came in the way, the duke of Hamilton, princi|pally,
and the duke of Gordon, the earl of Errol, lord Drummond, and
lord Hay were of opinion to put it off until they &s;aw what turn affairs
would take in parliament, in order to act accordingly afterwards with
the King's friends in England: but when the &s;ittings of parliament were
fini&s;hed, his Maje&s;ty's friends di&s;per&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible
for me to &s;peak to as many of them as I propo&s;ed. Yet, as the
bu&s;ine&s;s was not to be delayed, it was judged proper, that lord Drum|mond
and lord Hay &s;hould &s;peak to the re&s;t; and all tho&s;e who were
&s;poke to were overjoyed at the project, viz. the dukes of Hamilton
and Gordon, the marqui&s;es of Montro&s;e and Drummond, the earls of
Errol, Mari&s;hal, Moray, Hume, Strathmore, Panmure, Breadalbin, and
Aberdeen; the counte&s;s of Seaforth, who an&s;wers for the va&s;&s;als and de|pendants
of her &s;on in his ab&s;ence; the vi&s;counts Stormont and Kenmure;
the lords Salton and Sinclair; Sir Donald Mac Donald, the captain of
Clan Ronald, Lochiel, Glengary, Appin, Keppoch, and Bethadie for
the Mac Gregors.</P>
<P>Some time after I had left lord Lovat at Durham, he thought proper
to acquaint the earl of Argyle, that he was on the borders, and to a&s;k
him his protection in the country, under pretence of making his peace
with the government. The earl of Argyle having granted him this, he
went to the country of Argyle and, &s;oon thereafter, &s;ent for me thither,
to introduce me, according to my orders, to the Highland Chieftains.
I repaired thither in&s;tantly; but did not meet him, becau&s;e he had been
obliged to withdraw him&s;elf from that country, where he began to be
&s;u&s;pected: yet my journey to that country was not u&s;ele&s;s; for I &s;poke,
there, to Lochiel, Appin, and Bethadie. About this time, the parlia|ment
<PB N="679" REF="711">
had ju&s;t fini&s;hed its &s;ittings; and, a few days thereafter, lord Lovat
came to Edinburgh, where lord Drummond and he had an interview;
and it was then that lord Lovat &s;aw the duke of Queen&s;berry and the
earl of Leven. He gave notice of this to lord Drummond and to me,
and &s;howed us the nece&s;&s;ity under which he was to act in that manner.</P>
<P>At this time, all the noblemen and gentlemen returned to their coun|try-&s;eats;
and, it being impo&s;&s;ible for lord Lovat to remain any longer
in the country, becau&s;e there was an order to pro&s;ecute him, with fire
and &s;word, he was advi&s;ed to return to France. But, before he left Scot|land,
he was at Drummond-ca&s;tle, where we met &s;ome Highland chief|tains,
who engaged them&s;elves to have one of their number ready at the
time I &s;hould return to France, to come along with me, in order to de|clare
how well di&s;po&s;ed they were for the &s;ervice of their King. But the
great noi&s;e which the plot made &s;oon thereafter prevented that. It was
at Drummond-ca&s;tle that lord Lovat got the letters, which he carried to
this country from lord Drummond, from Appin, and from me. Soon
after this, I went to the North of Scotland with the lord Drummond, to
&s;ee &s;uch of the King of England's friends, in that country, as I had not
yet &s;een; and, ju&s;t when I was ready to &s;et out with my di&s;patches, I
was retarded by the news of the di&s;covery of the plot. His Britannick
Maje&s;ty's friends wi&s;hed very much, that a few troops had been &s;ent to
Scotland, at that time, which would have made all the country ri&s;e, &s;o
many of the Highland chieftains having been &s;ummoned before the
council. It was then the month of September; and, &s;ince that time, I
have been always waiting for a &s;afe opportunity of returning to France:
yet, before I left Scotland, I had fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances from all the King's
friends of their firmne&s;s in his Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t, as the letters which I
have brought do te&s;tify.</P>
<P>To &s;peak now of the terms, which the King's friends in Scotland de|mand,
for taking arms: the general opinion is, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to
have 5000 men from France, with good officers to command them, pro|vi&s;ions
for as long a time as &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary, arms for 20,000
men, and money to buy &s;addles, bridles, and other nece&s;&s;ary accoutre|ments
for mounting a proportionable number of dragoons, which will be
cho&s;en out of the 20,000 men.</P>
<P>If I am a&s;ked how tho&s;e 20,000 men can be rai&s;ed, I an&s;wer, that
there is no body, who knows the country, but will allow, that the duke

<P>&startq;I Am very happy to find an opportunity of a&s;&s;uring the King and
your Maje&s;ty of my inviolable &s;ervices. The bearer will give you
an exact account of the &s;tate of this country. Our rumours of plots
<PB N="681" REF="713">
have detained him longer here than he imagined; and he is, even now,
forced to take a round about way to return. He has been very zealous
in the &s;ervice of your Maje&s;ty, and he would have carried with him
many more proofs from the King's be&s;t &s;ubjects of their being di&s;po&s;ed
to ri&s;k every thing for his &s;ervice, but he dared not &s;how him&s;elf. But
I can a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty, that the King's friends augment in number
daily, and de&s;ire, with impatience, to have an opportunity to give proofs
of their loyalty. We are ill armed, and in the country where they are
be&s;t armed, I fear they are not the men who are mo&s;t to be depended
upon, although there are very good men among them. The Highland|ers
are well enough armed for their manner of fighting; but, unle&s;s we
have regular troops, it will be difficult to keep them long together.
Your Maje&s;ty can better determine the proper time for &s;ending troops,
money, and arms; but if I &s;hould venture to give my opinion on the
&s;ubject, which I do with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the proper time for &s;ending them
is, when the minds of men are inflamed, and the nation is in a kind of
fermentation, which will increa&s;e &s;till more when we are a&s;&s;embled in par|liament.

they received from their adherents in Britain, began to think
again of an inva&s;ion; and, in a memorial, pre&s;ented on the twenty-&s;econd
of June, this year, to Mon&s;. de Torcy, and Mon&s;. de Chamil|lart,
of which a copy likewi&s;e was &s;ent to the Pope's Nuncio, they en|deavoured
to &s;how, that it was the intere&s;t of France to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;on
of the late King James on the throne of Great Britain. All Europe, they
ob&s;erve, having mea&s;ured their &s;trength with France, found that their ef|forts
would be ineffectual, without the &s;upport of England: that this
was the rea&s;on of the re&s;olution taken, in con&s;equence of the league of
Aug&s;bourg, to attack the late King of England, as the firm and faith|ful
friend of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty: that France would be invin|cible,
in conjunction with a nation &s;o powerful and bold, which now
comprehended the Rhine and the Mediterranean within the &s;phere of
<PB N="682" REF="714">
its operations; but that this union could never take place, without the
re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the King of England: that the family of Hannover,
which was powerful of it&s;elf, and attached to that of Au&s;tria, would, if
once in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of England, form, in conjunction with Holland and
the empire, a perpetual league again&s;t France. To obviate an objection,
which, it &s;eems, had been frequently made, that the King of England,
when re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, might, through ingratitude or nece&s;&s;ity, break his en|gagements
with France, and forget his obligations to its &s;overeign, they
ob&s;erve, that a Catholic King in Britain mu&s;t be always dependent on
France. They prove this, by &s;everal rea&s;ons, which they frequently re|peated
to the French mini&s;try: and as the facility of e&s;tabli&s;hing him on
the throne of his ance&s;tors, was more univer&s;ally allowed, than the faci|lity
of the means, they endeavour to &s;how, that the inva&s;ion and re|duction
of Britain was a thing very practicable. The late Mon&s;. Bart
frequently declared, that he would engage, whenever the King would
choo&s;e to employ him, to carry over twenty thou&s;and men, and that this
was more practicable now than ever.</P>
<P>&startq;The loyalty of the greate&s;t part of the Scots,&endq; &s;ay they, &startq;is too
well known to require proofs; therefore, five thou&s;and men would be
&s;ufficient to engage all that country to take up arms, as appears from the
report of Mr. John Murray. But twenty thou&s;and men would be em|ployed
more u&s;efully in England, becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;age to that country is
&s;horter, and the blow would be more &s;peedy and deci&s;ive: for the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of that country would &s;oon draw the two other kingdoms after it.
All the oppo&s;ition to be met with in England would be &s;ome guards and
a few new-rai&s;ed troops di&s;per&s;ed in weak forts, in the di&s;tant parts of
the kingdom; with a weak prince&s;s, a very timid mini&s;ter, and a very
mercenary general, who&s;e heads might probably turn giddy, in &s;uch a
critical conjuncture as that would be; and who might then think of per|forming
promi&s;es they had &s;o often repeated, in order to de&s;erve their
pardon and other advantages.&endq;</P>
<P>They &s;how, finally, that the mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;on for a de&s;cent would
be the month of March, before the fleet of the enemy could be equipped:
that a de&s;cent would prevent its being fitted out: that the funds of the
preceding year would be exhau&s;ted and the trea&s;ury empty; and that no
one would be fooli&s;h enough to lend money then upon an uncertainty.

<P>&startq;COncerning Mr. Arm&s;worth [Marlborough], we need &s;ay no more,

If they are any thing of a piece with what Mr. Arm&s;worth [Marlbo|rough]

the &s;ame; and that one cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t well, without the other. I take
Mr. Trevers [Tun&s;tal] to be as knowing and able a merchant as any
that comes upon the exchange, and perhaps a degree hone&s;ter than &s;ome
we have to deal with; and his opinion is of great weight and advantage,
e&s;pecially if he and his partner, who are con&s;iderable, &s;hall act conform|ably

improving the&s;e good thoughts in him, &s;o as to make him act in con|junction

Wheatly [prince&s;s Anne] and Mathews [the King] trading together in

<P>&startq;I Wrote to you, upon the 22d la&s;t, my own opinion and Mr. Short's
[Gideon] of the gentleman Mr. Spence [Fra&s;er] again&s;t whom I al|ways
wrote, though he pretends to you to have made me his confident.
I told you likewi&s;e, that the aunt [lady Errol] looks on him as a villain,
though the nephew e&s;teems him yet an hone&s;t man. G. Milton [Gideon]
is &s;till in this country, but afraid of coming hither for fear of his credi|tors.
He has written to Capel [Mr. Hall] to meet him at Kirkaldie.
The gentlemen of this country are daily breaking. The lairds of Bel|namoon
and Boyne are both broke, and each of them reckoned above
100,000 merks wor&s;e than nothing; &s;o take notice to whom you advance
any money. There came lately a fleet, not from your town, Am&s;ter|dam,
but from Rotterdam, in which our government got notice there
were &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, and &s;o &s;eized upon them as &s;oon as they landed;
to wit, Sir G. Maxwell of Orcharton, who the Gazette, &s;ix months ago,
&s;aid was become a je&s;uit, and one captain Living&s;ton, who was lately ba|ni&s;hed
out of England, and Gordon, a factor at Paris, or I do not know
where. The fir&s;t two are yet in clo&s;e pri&s;on; the la&s;t was immediately &s;et
at liberty upon bail, which makes &s;ome think he has made di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>Your niece Mary is one of the notable&s;t hu&s;&s;eys in this country. She
de&s;erves a compliment and advice &s;ometimes from Sir James [the Queen].
Our parliament &s;at down on Thur&s;day la&s;t; but was immediately ad|journed
till Tue&s;day next, without the reading of the Queen's letter, or
the commi&s;&s;ioner or chancellor making their &s;peeches, which &s;eemed new
and &s;urpri&s;ing to all. 'Tis thought the rea&s;on of all this is, becau&s;e the
letter and &s;peeches u&s;ed to contain the commi&s;&s;ioners in&s;tructions and
rea&s;ons of the meeting, which is to be kept private till it be propo&s;ed,
at lea&s;t during this adjournment of &s;ix days, when the country-party
would have been contriving their arguments again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t part of our nobility are for Hannover, e&s;pecially the new
come in courtiers, as Tweedale, commi&s;&s;ioner, converted by his &s;on Ye&s;|ter,
<PB N="685" REF="717">
Rothes, Roxburgh, Haddington, and Jervi&s;wood, converted by &s;e|cretary
John&s;ton, now lord-regi&s;ter, the mo&s;t violent Hannoverian of any
Scotchman. He is &s;ent hither amba&s;&s;ador for that effect, not from Han|nover,
but from the Engli&s;h Hannoverians. Were it not for Hamilton,
it would certainly carry; but he works wonders again&s;t it. His two
brothers are again&s;t him, for which their mother is highly di&s;plea&s;ed, and
favours her elde&s;t &s;on's de&s;igns. He counts upon thirty of the nobility
for him, be&s;ides &s;ome boroughs and the mo&s;t part of the barons. Mon|tro&s;e
&s;ticks clo&s;e&s;t to him. Athol is violent again&s;t Hannover, though
it is &s;ugge&s;ted to him, he ought, at the &s;ame time, oppo&s;e the prince of
Wales, becau&s;e of his kindne&s;s to Beaufort. His brother, my lord Nairn,
is coming in, that he may vote again&s;t Hannover; and Sinclair, Oxen|ford,
the ma&s;ter, now lord Balmerino, with others ready to come in, if
there be need for them. 'Tis reported, that becau&s;e John&s;ton threat|ened
to bring in Glenco's murder, to hinder this, the Dalrymples are to
join with D. Hamilton, in oppo&s;ition of Hannover, upon his promi&s;ing
to hinder the plot from being examined. Leven will join with him
again&s;t Hannover. I hear likewi&s;e, that Salton, in odium of John&s;ton,
will oppo&s;e Hannover. It is thought, that Seafield, having wrote to
court, that he believes Hannover will not carry, will not be too violent
for him; but of him and Tarbat it's hard to make a judgment. We have
accounts of the duke of Bavaria's leaving the French intere&s;t, and of the
lo&s;s the French and Spaniards have had of late every where; but &s;ome
look upon this as forged news, to cau&s;e our parliament to enter into the
Engli&s;h mea&s;ures. We have had ringing of bells and firing of cannon this
afternoon, for a great victory the Emperor has got in Germany over the
French. We are a&s;toni&s;hed to hear that Mrs. Jackiline [James Murray]
is le&s;s noticed than John Milton [John Murray]. All here, e&s;pecially
Lady Mary, think her very far beyond him, and that more credit ought
to be given to her than to him. Queen&s;berry is indi&s;po&s;ed, &s;o cannot
come down to this parliament; yet it is believed, he is as much in the
Queen's favour as ever, and will be re&s;tored to all his places before it
is long.&endq;</P>

in&s;i&s;t on knowing his knibb informer [the &s;tate]; for, from the character
of the man, they will judge of the matter. It will be difficult to per|&s;uade
them, that the &s;tate can be brought to think it his intere&s;t to pre|fer
Mr. Harling [the King] to Mr. Davis [Hannover]. They will hardly
believe, that Mr. Mansfield [prince&s;s Anne] and her attorney [chief mi|ni&s;ter]

the Scoti&s;h plot, which has been mentioned &s;o often in the Stuart
Papers of the &s;ame period. Queen Anne, in her letter to the parlia|ment
of Scotland, which met at Edinburgh on the &s;ixth of July, recom|mended
to them the &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line. A &s;trange
di&s;tinction made u&s;e of by the earl of Cromarty, one of her mini&s;ters,
about her Maje&s;ty's <HI>revealed will,</HI> rai&s;ed, with other circum&s;tances, a &s;u&s;|picion
that her <HI>&s;ecret will</HI> was very different. A re&s;olve for a treaty with
England, in relation to commerce and other concerns, and for &s;uch li|mitations
and conditions of government, as might &s;ecure the religion,
liberty, and independency of the nation, prior to the nomination of a
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, was carried in parliament by a majority of fifty-five voices; of
whom thirty were the &s;ervants of the court, and &s;uppo&s;ed to act accord|ing
to the orders which they had received. The Queen was obliged, be|fore
&s;he could obtain any &s;upply, to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to the act of
&s;ecurity; by which it was provided, that, in ca&s;e her Maje&s;ty &s;hould die
without i&s;&s;ue, the parliament, if not then &s;itting, &s;hould meet and de|clare
a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown, who &s;hould not be the SAME PERSON that
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the crown of England, unle&s;s, before that time, there
was a &s;ettlement made in parliament of the rights and liberties of the
nation, independent of Engli&s;h coun&s;els.</P>

as they pretend to be; &s;ince they were &s;o violent for the bill again&s;t oc|ca&s;ional
conformity, and &s;o ready to prevent a thorough examination in|to
the Scotch plot, that there is great expectation of a di&s;&s;olution of the
parliament after the &s;e&s;&s;ion is over, and that &s;he will change hands; but
you know all this will depend upon the advice of tho&s;e in power.</P>
<P>However, I humbly tell you my opinion, that there can be no &s;ecurity
to her Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, without inquiring into the bottom of this plot.
She mu&s;t do this, or follow the precedent of King Stephen, who agreed
that Henry the Second &s;hould &s;ucceed, to quiet con&s;piracies and wars;
and this would be too dangerous an example to be tru&s;ted to the power
of France.</P>
<P>If the plot is pro&s;ecuted, it will inevitably follow, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors
mu&s;t be invited over, and new mea&s;ures taken; but if it is &s;tifled, we

<P>&startq;I AM very much obliged to you, for the letter you wrote to me on
the 5th in&s;tant, and for your having been plea&s;ed to communicate
to me your thoughts on the operations of the campaign in the empire.
They appear to me very &s;olid, and perfectly &s;uitable to the good of
the common cau&s;e. I doubt not but, with the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we may
flatter our&s;elves with a glorious &s;ucce&s;s; &s;uch a &s;alutary plan formed and
conducted by a general, who&s;e good intentions and knowledge are &s;o well
known. The interview which you propo&s;e with the margrave of Baden,
and the countenance which the enemy will &s;how, when you approach them,
<PB N="691" REF="723">
mu&s;t enable you to judge what you ought to do, and to determine to
take mea&s;ures as ju&s;t as the importance of the bu&s;ine&s;s requires.</P>
<P>I imagine, my lord, that the cities you &s;pecify may furni&s;h nearly the
heavy artillery nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;iege. It would be proper to concert this
with the Elector of Mentz, who, being one of the directors of the circle
of Franconia, may contribute greatly, by his influence, to enable you to
provide your&s;elf. But le&s;t you &s;hould be di&s;appointed, it would be
proper not to depend upon finding, in that country, the hor&s;es and car|riages
nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;port this artillery from place to place. It would
be &s;urer, therefore, to furni&s;h your&s;elf with them before-hand. It is &s;till
more certain, that you will find neither powder nor ball in that country;
and the indi&s;pen&s;able occa&s;ion which you will have for them, &s;hould in|duce
you to give, in time, po&s;itive orders for tran&s;porting a &s;ufficient quan|tity
of them, it being otherwi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible that you can execute any thing
con&s;iderable again&s;t an enemy who can, very ea&s;ily, avoid a battle, and
reduce you to a nece&s;&s;ity of forming a &s;iege, or of pa&s;&s;ing all the &s;ea&s;on
of the campaign u&s;ele&s;sly. I am not without &s;ome hopes that the mar|grave
of Baden, by reinforcing the army of general Thungen, by de|tachments
from the army, which is in the lines of Beihl, may hinder the
junction of the reinforcement which France de&s;igns for the Elector of
Bavaria, and that, upon your arrival, the &s;ituation of affairs may be &s;till
the &s;ame&punc; But you will, no doubt, judge it very nece&s;&s;ary to ha&s;ten your
march, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, left you &s;hould give time to the enemy
to make any progre&s;s before you are at hand to prevent them. Prince
Eugene, who will come to command the army of Franconia, will, on
his &s;ide, do every thing that is po&s;&s;ible for him, in order to act in con|cert
with you, and to &s;econd your operations effectually.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent to that prince, and to the Margrave of Baden, the inclo&s;ed
memorial, which an emi&s;&s;ary of France, taken in this country, was em|ployed
to carry to the mare&s;chal de Mar&s;in. This piece will &s;hew you the
de&s;igns of the enemy again&s;t the empire, and the places where they pro|po&s;ed
to act offen&s;ively, while they keep upon the defen&s;ive in others.
You are too penetrating not to &s;ee the u&s;e which may be made of this
intelligence, and the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping it a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, my lord, the happy &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign may advance the
glory which the preceding has procured you: in this I intere&s;t my&s;elf very

<P>&startq;I Wrote to you la&s;t week, in an&s;wer to the la&s;t I had from you, and
we have ye&s;terday two po&s;ts from England, one more being due.</P>
<P><PB N="693" REF="725">
I have no opinion that the affairs in Scotland will go well. My lord
Queen&s;berry is put out from being &s;ecretary, and the Queen will not de|clare
her&s;elf to ju&s;tify my lord Leven, or any of that party. All is put
into the hands of tho&s;e who were ever the mo&s;t bitter enemies to the
late King and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. If they will &s;$ttle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it is
more than can be rea&s;onably expected; but if it is not propo&s;ed and
&s;ettled, in the fir&s;t place, I am &s;ure that nothing will be d$ne in it at
pre&s;ent, and know what opinion I ought to have of the mea&s;ures in
England; perhaps our mini&s;ters will be &s;atisfied with a little money,
without &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but if th$y are of that opinion, they may
live to think they are in the wrong. However, there is no affection
wanting in England towards this hou&s;e. I &s;ee &s;ome thence, and hear
from many; and am confident that the next parliament there will do all
that can be wi&s;hed or de&s;ired by us, though, at the &s;ame time, I do not
think that there will be a new parliament called this &s;ummer.</P>
<P>If there were any &s;incere intentions towards &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
Scotland, I &s;hould think that there would have been &s;ome notice of it
given here, and of the means that will be u&s;ed towards it; and al&s;o of
the rea&s;ons for employing the men that were always again&s;t it; but I do
not hear of any thing of that nature. The conduct of this affair will in|fallibly
let us &s;ee on what ground we &s;tand, what is to be expected, and
open the eyes of all our friends in England. I believe Mr. John&s;ton is
mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed my lord Queen&s;berry in the office of &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>But let the&s;e matters go how they will, our friends in England are
&s;teady, and I fear the Queen is not in good health; if I am well in|formed,
and I think I am, it is no &s;mall confirmation that the power of
our friends in England is much &s;uperior to that of our enemies, and the
duke of Buckingham does &s;till u&s;e all the means he can to be well with
her royal highne&s;s the Electre&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He was invariably in the intere&s;t, and often in the corre&s;pondence, of the exiled family.</NOTE>. I have lately &s;een a letter he writ

not do) wherein he offers all the &s;ervice in the world; but it was an|&s;wered

<P>THE conte&s;ts between the Whigs and Tories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1705. January.</NOTE> which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
in the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, ro&s;e to an extraordinary height in the begin|ning
of the pre&s;ent year. The &s;trife of parties being principally for of|fice
and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, tho&s;e principles which they held forth
to the public were forgot in the private concerns of their leaders. The
Tories, in particular, from whom the court of St. Germains derived their
chief hopes, were more intent upon annoying the Whigs, than on for|warding
the views of the pretended prince of Wales. This circum&s;tance
renders the corre&s;pondence of the pre&s;ent year unintere&s;ting. Yet it ap|pears,
from the following extracts from lord Caryll's letters, that, when
Marlborough and Godolphin were accu&s;ed by the Tories of having
adopted the principles of the Whigs, they &s;till continued their &s;ecret pro|fe&s;&s;ions
of attachment to the exiled family.</P>

<HEAD>Extracts from Lord Caryll's letters, continued.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;I Cannot but take notice of what you &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Caryll's Letters, vol. v. fol. Scotch Col|lege.</NOTE> that notwith&s;tanding for|mer

it will be very welcome news to your partners; if he doth not,
it will be no &s;urpri&s;e to me, con&s;idering all that hath pa&s;t.</P>
<P>You will perhaps wonder when I tell you that your friend Arm&s;worth
[Marlborough] invited him&s;elf to &s;up in private with Mrs. Trimings [duche&s;s
of Marlborough's &s;i&s;ter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The dutche&s;s of Tyrconnel, who was at this time in London.</NOTE>], the very night that he came away. This is
<PB N="696" REF="728">
the more to be wondered at,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> becau&s;e they had not &s;een one another in
God knows how many years before. The gentlewoman her&s;elf tells me,
that their conver&s;ation, e&s;pecially on his part, was all in general terms;
and that, when &s;he de&s;cended to &s;ome particulars, his an&s;wer was, that
he would do what honour and ju&s;tice obliged him to do, without parti|cularizing
any thing.</P>
<P>The adherents of the excluded family, always ready to gra&s;p at every
incident, that &s;eemed to favour their own views, had their eyes fixed for
&s;everal years pa&s;t upon Scotland; where a jealou&s;y of England, which
a&s;&s;umed the name of &s;pirit, had rai&s;ed extraordinary heats in parlia|ment.
They might, however, have been convinced, that, when the
duke of Hamilton in&s;inuate to them, that money was nece&s;&s;ary to con|firm
the fidelity of tho&s;e who pretended to be attached to their cau&s;e, that
the continuance of the ferment, upon which they had built their hopes,
depended entirely upon tho&s;e who managed the trea&s;ury of England.
The lord Godolphin, terrified by the Whigs, made u&s;e of the weight
of his office to influence the affairs of Scotland; and, before the end of
the &s;e&s;&s;ion, he managed his power with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that an end was
put, at once, to the noi&s;e of the country party, and to the de&s;igns of the
cavaliers. Several of the latter, who probably fore&s;aw, that they could
derive no hopes of accompli&s;hing their views by an oppo&s;ition in par|liament,
tran&s;mitted the following intelligence to St. Germains, with a

<P>&startq;WE have a great difficulty here to concert our mea&s;ures together;
for it would be much ea&s;ier for us to find many to be &s;ent to
you, than to reduce them to two or three. But I doubt not but all tho&s;e
who &s;hall be &s;ent, will agree in general to the following articles; namely,
that it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end hither a &s;ufficient force, and to &s;end it in the
way which will &s;uit you be&s;t; and as it does not appear to be very prac|ticable
to tran&s;port a &s;ufficient number of troops, as far as Scotland, it
is thought that it will be more convenient to land them in &s;ome port in
England, which may be conde&s;cended upon as the mo&s;t convenient and
nearer to you.</P>
<P>The computation which is commonly made of the number of troops
that mu&s;t be &s;ent to render the enterpri&s;e &s;ucce&s;sful, is about 10 or
12,000 men, which mu&s;t be &s;ent at the &s;ame time, in ca&s;e they are &s;ent
to Scotland; but, if it is judged more proper to land them in England,
in that ca&s;e, be&s;ides this number, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end 3000 men
more to this country, for protecting the King's friends, who will declare
for him here, and for putting them in a condition of &s;ending &s;uccours to
the troops which &s;hall have landed in England.</P>
<P>Arms are demanded for 20,000 men: but, if money enough is &s;ent
in time, to enable the people of the country to arm them&s;elves, a &s;maller
quantity of arms will be &s;ufficient. With regard to terms between the King
and his &s;ubjects, I do not believe it will be very difficult to &s;ettle them.
It will be always nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end a plau&s;ible declaration, in which his
Maje&s;ty will promi&s;e to redre&s;s the grievances of his &s;ubjects, and to re|fer
him&s;elf to a free parliament, for rectifying the abu&s;es and the illegal
proceedings of the pre&s;ent government. It will be nece&s;&s;ary to promi&s;e
likewi&s;e to &s;end a &s;upply of money &s;ufficient to &s;upport an enterpri&s;e of
this nature; and, in the mean time, it would be of great advantage, if
money to buy arms could be &s;ent immediately; for, both in the &s;outh
of the kingdom and here, they are very de&s;irous of being armed; but
<PB N="698" REF="730">
the misfortunes of the times have impoveri&s;hed the generality of the
people, to &s;uch a degree, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to furni&s;h them|&s;elves
with arms, at their own expence, &s;o &s;peedily as they would wi&s;h;

with di&s;cretion, would render more &s;ervice to the King, in the pre&s;ent
conjuncture, and advance his affairs farther, than &s;ix times the &s;um on
any other occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This is what is expected from you, and, with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and
&s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as is now demanded, there is not the &s;malle&s;t doubt, but
the enterpri&s;e will &s;ucceed. But, if you &s;end a &s;maller number of troops
than is mentioned above, it is the general opinion, that that will only &s;erve
to ruin all the friends which the King has in this country at pre&s;ent;
and to prevent any attempt to be made, for a long time, for the &s;ervice
of his Maje&s;ty in any of his kingdoms: for, be&s;ides the &s;ecurity and
encouragement which a &s;ufficient force will give his friends here, it will
induce tho&s;e who are neuter to join them, and force their enemies to
&s;ubmit. Whereas if the body of troops which is &s;ent, is not &s;ufficient
to make the proper exertions, all tho&s;e who are neuter, and who love
their ea&s;e, and the&s;e are very numerous, will &s;tay at home; and it is cer|tain
that his Maje&s;ty's enemies will oppo&s;e, with all their force, any body
of troops which they may hope to vanqui&s;h. Therefore, both the King's
friends and the foreign troops, which will come in &s;mall numbers to their
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will come only to be ruined all at once, which God forbid;
or to involve them&s;elves in a long and de&s;tructive war, the i&s;&s;ue of which,
in all probability, will be fatal.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;entiments of people here on this &s;ubject. I leave to tho&s;e
who are more intere&s;ted in the ca&s;e, to determine what they have to do
on this occa&s;ion. The ab&s;ence of lord Arran, who&s;e return we expect
every minute, and the expectations from the approaching parliament, are
the rea&s;ons which have prevented us from &s;ending hitherto the per&s;ons
expected from us.</P>
<P>The bearer of this is in a hurry to &s;et out; therefore I can &s;ay no
more to you at pre&s;ent. I &s;hall only add, that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="699" REF="731">
to &s;end &s;ome money to keep up the corre&s;pondence, and to carry on
our affairs with more expedition. For tho&s;e who have hitherto furni&s;hed
that expence, are not now in a condition to continue it, on account of
the bad payment of their farmers and other accidents. A &s;um of thirty
thou&s;and livres, placed in good hands, and managed faithfully, would
be of greater utility here to the King's &s;ervice than you can imagine. In
&s;hort, without this &s;mall &s;upply, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to advance
our affairs.</P>
<P>The following extracts explain them&s;elves. It &s;eems that, though the
duke of Marlborough and the lord Godolphin had no intentions of tak|ing
an active part in favour of the excluded family, they &s;till continued
their profe&s;&s;ions of attachment, and promi&s;es of future &s;ervices. It is
difficult to &s;ay what could induce them to continue their intercour&s;e with
the agents of the court of St. Germains, unle&s;s they were from principle
attached to its intere&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD>Extracts from Lord Caryll's letters, continued.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;WHAT you &s;ay to me concerning what pa&s;&s;ed in your la&s;t meet|ing
with Mr. Arm&s;worth [Marlborough],<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Caryll's Letters, vol. v. fol. Scotch College.</NOTE> though it be but a
repetition of what I formerly heard to be &s;aid by that merchant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 25.</NOTE> yet, at
this time, I confe&s;s it is very &s;urpri&s;ing to me: for very few men will
lye only for lying's &s;ake, but for &s;ome profit or advantage. Now, con|&s;idering
the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing condition of that merchant, and his cre|ditors
want means, more than ever, to go to law with him, it would be
very &s;trange, if he &s;hould make &s;uch promi&s;es and prote&s;tations, without
any intention of performing them. On the other &s;ide, words are but
wind, when they are not followed by deeds; and when they cla&s;h, the
one by the other, the man mu&s;t be judged by his actions. It is true,
that what he formerly told you in Norley's [Scotch parliament] affair
came to pa&s;s, that nothing &s;hould be done in the favour of Hanmer
[Hannover] to our prejudice; but whether that was brought about by
any indu&s;try of his, or rather not again&s;t his will, remains &s;till in the
dark. According to all outward appearances, he and his partners did
then, as they do now, drive on violently for the intere&s;t of Hanmer
[Hannover]. So that to explain this riddle, we mu&s;t &s;ee what will be
<PB N="700" REF="732">
done at Norley's [Scotch parliament] next meeting; which will be a
cri&s;is to determine our judgment in this matter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You al&s;o further enlarge in yours of&mdash;,<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 14.</NOTE> what pa&s;&s;ed between you
and Arm&s;worth [Marlborough] when you la&s;t met, adding that parti|cular
of his liking the pound of tea with which you pre&s;ented him. But
I do not like the an&s;wer he made, when you doubted whether it would
be agreeable to his wife's palate; he &s;aid he could &s;ee faults at home,
but they would be &s;oon over. Now, this is a plain confe&s;&s;ion of his
wife's pre&s;ent not reli&s;hing the tea, in which he is to be believed. But,
on the other &s;ide, I cannot believe that he and his wife have a different
palate; and therefore fear that what he unawares confe&s;&s;ed of his wife's
reli&s;hing, is too &s;ure an indication of his own. We &s;hall thank provi|dence
if any good comes from him: at the wor&s;t, it is good, at lea&s;t, not
to be deceived. The pound of tea which captain Gordon de&s;ires for his
great friend, will be &s;ent you by the fir&s;t opportunity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t al&s;o own the receipt of yours of the 3d of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 30.</NOTE> wherein you
relate what pa&s;&s;ed between you and Mr. Goul&s;ton [Godolphin]; which
merchant is not &s;o prodigal of his words as his partner Arm&s;worth
[Marlborough], and therefore they are &s;omewhat more to be relied upon,
and, unle&s;s they both join to deceive, much may be hoped from their
agreeing both in the &s;ame &s;tory.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I did believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 23.</NOTE> that the credit of Mr. Arm&s;worth [Marlborough]
would not be kept up &s;o high as formerly, in regard of &s;ome di&s;appoint|ments
he has lately met with. Yet I am told he has newly had a lucky hit,
which may po&s;&s;ibly &s;et him up again as high. Be it as it will, there
are many who will &s;till think he is more fortunate than hone&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It mu&s;t not be denied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 23.</NOTE> but that Arm&s;worth's [Marlborough's] pre|diction,
made not long &s;ince to Berry, concerning Norley's [Scotch par|liament]
affair, proves true; and there is rea&s;on to hope, that what has
fallen out is the effect of his good intentions; but that point mu&s;t be
cleared by his &s;ub&s;equent actions.</P>
<P>P. S. I cannot omit telling my apprehen&s;ions, that although it was in
the power of Arm&s;worth [Marlborough] and his partner Goul&s;ton [Go|dolphin],
with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Goldeny, to have carried their cau&s;e in
the behalf of Hanmer [Hannover] at Norley's [Scotch parliament] trial,
<PB N="701" REF="733">
yet I doubt whether the true and only cau&s;e of their &s;o not doing, was
not in pro&s;pect of keeping on foot the trade of their friend Sharp and
his dependants, after the law&s;uit &s;hould happen to be ended between
Manly [the King] and Wheatly [England]; for they po&s;&s;ibly may have
great need of &s;uch a friend, at that time, to &s;tand by them, for the &s;up|port
of their own trade and credit.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Men's minds mu&s;t be &s;trangely altered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 10.</NOTE> if Mr. Heyden [Tories] and
his friends make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to have Mr. Hanmer [Hannover]
among&s;t them, in oppo&s;ition to Gilburn [Godolphin], Arm&s;worth [Marl|borough],
and Wanly's [the Whigs] friends. It looks as if all things
tended to a confu&s;ion among&s;t them, out of which I pray God &s;end order
may follow.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am in your debt for two of your letters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 22.</NOTE> In the fir&s;t, you promi&s;e
me a farther account of Mr. Heyden's [Tories] di&s;po&s;ition, in reference
to Arm&s;worth [Marlborough], Goul&s;ton [Godolphin], and partners,
which al&s;o, in your la&s;t, you have put off to a further time. I hear, from
other hands, what you have &s;aid in general, that Heyden [Tories], in
conjunction with Ken&s;y and his company, are preparing to commence a
&s;uit again&s;t tho&s;e other merchants, for interloping and double dealing
with Mr. Norley [the Scots] in Hanmer's [Hannover's] negociation,
alledging that it was in tho&s;e fir&s;t merchants' power to have carried the
cau&s;e in behalf of Hanmer [Hannover], which failed through their wil|ful
neglect, whatever appearance there was to the contrary. I believe
this may &s;tick hard upon Goul&s;ton [Godolphin] and Arm&s;worth [Marl|borough];
for had they, at the trial, produced the evidence of Goldeny<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Money, probably.</NOTE>,
which they might have done, the verdict, in all likelihood, would have
gone for our friend Hanmer [Hannover]. But as they brew &s;o let them
bake; which is all I have to &s;ay in the matter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am much of your opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October 19.</NOTE> that Mr. Heyden [Tories] and Renzy's
project of &s;iding with Hanmer [Hannover], comes from a motive of
revenge, rather than of intere&s;t or inclination; but what it will produce
time mu&s;t &s;hew, as well as how the difference will end between Norley
[Scotland] and Wheatly [England]. A certain gentlewoman, who&s;e name
I have forgot, but Mr. Gawin, who I believe is in town, can tell it you by
<PB N="702" REF="734">
this mark; for &s;he came over in company, or about the &s;ame time, with
Crofton's [Middleton's] former clerk, who was brought into trouble, and
was much talked of at the time. Now, this woman &s;ays, that &s;ome of
your cou&s;in Wi&s;ely's [Queen's] tenants have made offers to pay in pre|&s;ent
a year's rent, and al&s;o &s;ome arrears, and be at the charge of the
law, if your cou&s;in Wi&s;ely will renew their lea&s;es: for, it &s;eems, they
have refu&s;ed to pay their rents to the pre&s;ent occupants, le&s;t they &s;hould
pay them twice. I &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Gawin may be acquainted with this wo|man;
therefore you may de&s;ire him to inquire further into this matter.
Mr. Ro&s;e has formerly hinted &s;omething of a like nature, and probably
this woman and he may have conferred notes together about it. There|fore,
if you think it convenient, you may take &s;ome occa&s;ion of conver&s;ing
with him about it. You may be &s;ure the tenants are well &s;atisfied that
your cou&s;in Wi&s;ely's title is good in law, or el&s;e they would not make
the&s;e offers.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am informed our old acquaintance Mr. Ar. Blake<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Probably the duke of Hamilton, who was now &s;uppo&s;ed, by the Jacobites, to be
trimming with the other &s;ide.</NOTE> intends to leave
Norley's hou&s;e [Scotland],<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 7.</NOTE> and remove to Wheatly's [England], with
intention to make fair weather, if he can, with Young [prince&s;s Anne]
and his partners, and to di&s;cover whether there be any private corre|&s;pondence
between tho&s;e merchants and Ple&s;&s;ington [the King], of which
he has formerly had &s;ome &s;u&s;picion, as I think you may remember; and
I gue&s;s, that if he can find it to be &s;o, he would willingly &s;trike with
them, and join &s;tocks with them in that trade. But if he cannot di&s;|cover
that they are &s;o inclined, I believe he will quit that thought, and
join with them (if admitted) upon their own terms. He is &s;o cunning
a dealer, that I believe they will be afraid of him, and hardly take him
into their company. However, this I can a&s;&s;ure you, that your kin&s;man
Ple&s;&s;ington [the King] has not given him the lea&s;t indication or ground of
&s;urmi&s;e, that there is any corre&s;pondence or joining of &s;tocks between
him and Mr. Young's partners [prince&s;s Anne's mini&s;ters].&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am of your opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 15.</NOTE> not to move in that other bu&s;ine&s;s of your
cou&s;in's jointure as yet, though all that is pretended &s;hould be true;
your rea&s;ons for not doing it &s;o &s;oon being very good. And whether it
will be worth your while to con&s;ult Mr. Goul&s;ton [Godolphin] about it
<PB N="703" REF="735">
at pre&s;ent, mu&s;t be further con&s;idered. In the mean time, you will have
lei&s;ure to find out upon what grounds tho&s;e tenants of your cou&s;in are
a&s;&s;erted to be di&s;po&s;ed to return to her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to what relates to the tenants of the widow's jointure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 30.</NOTE> I am fully
of your opinion, for the rea&s;ons you mention, that nothing ought to be
&s;tirred in it till Ea&s;ter-time be over, and till we &s;ee how another lead|ing
cau&s;e will be carried. I am of opinion that your friend Mr. Heyden
[Tories] has received of late &s;o little encouragement towards the carry|ing
on his great de&s;igns, that he will cool in them for the pre&s;ent, and
expect a better &s;ea&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I find that we differ not in opinion concerning Mr. Blake<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The duke of Hamilton.</NOTE> and his
manner of proceeding;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 7.</NOTE> and think it will be nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould
intimate to our partners, that he has been more than once curious to
know whether or no they are in any intelligence with Mr. Ple&s;&s;ington
[the King]; and, moreover, to a&s;&s;ure them, that Mr. Ple&s;&s;ington [the
King] has never &s;atisfied his curio&s;ity on that point, nor given the lea&s;t
ground to &s;urmi&s;e, that there is any corre&s;pondence or joining of &s;tock
between him and Mr. Young's partners [prince&s;s Anne's mini&s;ters]. You
may take the time which you &s;hall judge mo&s;t convenient to repre&s;ent

<P>THOUGH the eventual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the family of Hannover had
been provided for, by the act of &s;ettlement, their mounting the
throne was &s;till a matter of great uncertainty with the nation. The
&s;tate of things, however, was changed before the end of the pre&s;ent
year; when the Whigs, who had held forth the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as
the main object of their principles, had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the chief power
in the kingdom. Before that period, the letters to the court of Hanno|ver
were merely official or complimentary, and contained little informa|tion
with regard to the nation.</P>
<P>To explain the Hannover papers, under the head of this year, it may
not be improper to premi&s;e a brief account of the events which they con|cern.
Sophia Charlotte, Queen of Pru&s;&s;ia, only daughter of Erne&s;t
Augu&s;tus, Elector of Hannover, and of the prince&s;s Sophia, died on the
fir&s;t of February, in the pre&s;ent year. George William, duke of Zell,
uncle and father-in-law of George Lewis, the reigning Elector, died al&s;o
on the eighth of Augu&s;t, in the eighty-fir&s;t year of his age. George
Augu&s;tus, the Electoral prince, married, on the &s;econd of September,
Wilhelmina Caroline, daughter of the marquis of Brandenburgh An|&s;pach.
The corre&s;pondence of the year con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of an&s;wers, &s;ent
by the Elector, his mother and his &s;on, to letters either of condolance or
congratulation, on events in which their family was &s;o much concerned.
The&s;e letters were originally written by Robethon, and afterwards tran|&s;cribed
from his draughts, by the electoral family.</P>

The principal de&s;ign of my journey was, to know exactly the number

It is true, he makes me hope, they will be augmented in time to 20 bat|talions

<P>&startq;THE news of the important advantage which you have obtained
gave me a very &s;en&s;ible joy. I am much obliged to you for the
