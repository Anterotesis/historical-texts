<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
FIFTEENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_NEITHER this book, nor indeed &s;ome of the
following, are to be reckon'd among the mo&s;t
&s;hining parts of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> They are nar|rative,
and generally low; yet natural, and
ju&s;t enough, con&s;idering <HI>Homer</HI> was re&s;olv|ed
to de&s;cribe and follow low life &s;o very
minutely. This great Poet here re&s;embles an
evening Sun; he has not the &s;ame heat or
brightne&s;s; there are &s;everal little clouds about him, tho' in &s;ome
places gilded and adorn'd: however, to make us amends, he
breaks out again before the conclu&s;ion of his cour&s;e, and &s;ets at
la&s;t in glory.</P>
<P>There is no doubt, but all the parts of a Poem are not capa|ble
of equal lu&s;tre; nay, they ought not to dazzle us alike, or
tire us by a perpetual &s;train upon the Imagination. But in the&s;e
cooler relations a Tran&s;lator has a hard task: He is expected to
<HI>&s;hine,</HI> where the Author is <HI>not bright:</HI> and the unrea&s;onable Cri|tick
demands a Copy more noble than the Original. 'Tis true,
the&s;e are the pa&s;&s;ages of which he ought to take particular care,
<PB N="38" REF="38">
and to &s;et them off to the be&s;t advantage: But however he may
poli&s;h a vulgar &s;tone, it will &s;till retain its inherent degree of
cloudine&s;s; and the Man is ignorant indeed, who thinks one
can make it a Diamond.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;tory now turns to <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and the Poet briefly de|&s;cribes
his voyage to his country: There is a nece&s;&s;ity to be
conci&s;e, for the Heroe of an Epic Poem is never to be out of
&s;ight, after his introduction. The little time that <HI>Homer</HI> employs
in the return of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> is not &s;pent unu&s;efully by <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> du|ring
this interval, he learns the &s;tate of his publick and dome|&s;tick
affairs from <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> and prepares the way for the de&s;tructi|on
of the Suitors, the chief de&s;ign of the whole <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> There
is another rea&s;on why the Poet ought not to dwell at large upon
the &s;tory of <HI>Telemachus;</HI> he bears but an incidental relation to the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>Homer</HI> was nece&s;&s;itated to pa&s;s over his
actions with brevity, that he might de&s;cribe the Heroe of his
Poem at full length. It has been objected, that no mention has
been made of any Action at all of <HI>Telemachus</HI> during his whole
&s;tay with <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and that he lies there idly, without making
his voyage contribute any thing to the re&s;titution of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> but
from the former ob&s;ervation it is evident, that this &s;ilence in the
Poet proceeds from judgment; nothing is to be in&s;erted in an E|pic
Poem but what has &s;ome affinity with the main de&s;ign of
it: but what affinity could the Actions of <HI>Telemachus</HI> in the <HI>Spar|tan</HI>
Court have with tho&s;e of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es?</HI> This would have been to
make two Heroes in one Poem, and would have broken the Uni|ty
of the Action; whereas by the contrary conduct <HI>Homer</HI> unites
the two &s;tories, and makes the voyage of <HI>Telemachus</HI> &s;ub&s;ervient
to the chief Action; namely, the re&s;titution of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es. Telema|chus</HI>
undertakes a voyage to make enquiry after <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> this the
Poet fully de&s;cribes, becau&s;e it has an immediate relation to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI>
but pa&s;&s;es over all other adventures during the ab&s;ence of <HI>Telema|chus,</HI>
becau&s;e they have no relation to the de&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="39">
I know it has been objected, that the whole &s;tory of <HI>Telema|chus</HI>
is foreign to the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> and that the four fir&s;t books have
not a &s;ufficient connection with the re&s;t of the Poem, and there|fore
that there is a double Action: But this objection will cea&s;e,
if it be made appear, that this voyage contributes to the re&s;tora|tion
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> for whatever incident has &s;uch an effect is united
to the &s;ubject, and e&s;&s;ential to it. Now that this voyage has
&s;uch an effect is very evident; the Suitors were ready to &s;eize the
Throne of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and compel his wife to marry; but by this
voyage <HI>Telemachus</HI> breaks their whole de&s;igns. In&s;tead of u&s;urp|ing
the Throne, they are oblig'd to defend them&s;elves: they de|fer
their purpo&s;e, and wa&s;te much time in endeavouring to in|tercept
him in his return. By this method lei&s;ure is gained from
the violence and addre&s;&s;es of the Suitors, till <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> returns and
brings about his own re-e&s;tabli&s;hment. This voyage therefore is
the &s;ecret &s;ource from which all the happine&s;s of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> flows:
for had not <HI>Telemachus</HI> &s;ailed to <HI>Pyle, Penelope</HI> mu&s;t have been
compell'd to marry, and the Throne of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> u&s;urp'd. I have
been more large upon this Objection, becau&s;e many foreign Cri|tics
lay great weight upon it. See Note XIX on the fir&s;t book.</P>
<P>There has lately been a great di&s;pute among&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> con|cerning
the length of the &s;tay of <HI>Telemachus</HI> from his country.
The debate is not very material, nor is it very difficult to &s;ettle that
point. <HI>Telemachus</HI> &s;ail'd from <HI>Ithaca</HI> in the evening of the &s;e|cond
day, and returns to it on the thirty eighth in the morning,
&s;o that he is ab&s;ent thirty five days compleatly.</P>

by an Hi&s;torian, he would have only &s;aid that <HI>Telemachus</HI>
judg'd it nece&s;&s;ary for his affairs to &s;ail back to his own country;
but a Poet &s;teps out of the common beaten road, a&s;cribes the
Wi&s;dom of that Heroe to the Godde&s;s of it, and introduces
her in per&s;on, to give a dignity to his Poetry.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="40">
The Reader may con&s;ult in general the extracts from <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI>
(plac'd before the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI>) concerning Machines, or the inter|po&s;ition
of Deities in Epic Poetry: I will here beg leave to &s;et
them in a different and more particular light.</P>
<P>It has been imagin'd that a Deity is never to be introduc'd
but when all human means are ineffectual: If this were true,
<HI>Minerva</HI> would be in vain employ'd in bringing <HI>Telemachus</HI> back,
when a common Me&s;&s;enger might have an&s;wer'd that purpo&s;e as
well as the Godde&s;s. I doubt not but the ver&s;e of <HI>Horace</HI> has
led many into this error;
<Q>Nec Deus inter&s;it ni&s;i dignus vindice nodus.</Q>
This rule is to be apply'd only to the Theater, of which <HI>Ho|race</HI>
there &s;peaks, and means no more, than when the knot of the
Play is to be unty'd, and no other way is left for making the
di&s;covery, then let a God de&s;cend and clear the intricacy to the
Auditors. But, as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> ob&s;erves, it has no relation to Epic
Poetry.</P>
<P>It is true, that a Deity is never to be introduced upon little
and unworthy occa&s;ions; the very de&s;ign of Machines is to add
weight and dignity to the &s;tory, and con&s;equently an unworthy
employment defeats the very intent of them, and deba&s;es the
Deities by making them act in offices unworthy of the chara|cters
of divine per&s;onages: But then it is as true, that a Poet is
at liberty to u&s;e them for ornament as well as nece&s;&s;ity. For in|&s;tance,
both <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> in their de&s;criptions of Storms in|troduce
Deities, <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Aeolus,</HI> only to fill our minds with
grandeur and terror; for in reality a &s;torm might have hap|pen'd
without a miracle, and <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> both have been
driven upon unknown &s;hores, by a common &s;torm as well as by
the immediate interpo&s;ition of <HI>Neptune</HI> or <HI>Aeolus.</HI> But Machines
have a very happy effect; the Poet &s;eems to conver&s;e with Gods,
gives &s;igns of a divine tran&s;port, and di&s;tingui&s;hes his Poem in
all parts from an Hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>VERSE 5. <HI>Beneath the royal Portico,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Minerva</HI> here
finds <HI>Telemachus</HI> in bed: It is nece&s;&s;ary to remember that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
landed in <HI>Ithaca</HI> in the morning of the thirty fifth day; and
when <HI>Minerva</HI> left him, &s;he went to the <HI>Spartan</HI> Court to <HI>Tele|machus;</HI>
this vi&s;ion therefore appears to that Heroe in the night
following the thirty fifth day. On the thirty &s;ixth he departs
from <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and lodges that night with <HI>Diocles;</HI> on the thirty
&s;eventh he embarks towards the evening, &s;ails all night, and lands
on the thirty eighth in the morning in his own country. From
this ob&s;ervation it is likewi&s;e evident, that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> pa&s;&s;es two days
in di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> tho' the Poet only di&s;tingui&s;hes the time

with the thirty fifth day, and <HI>Telemachus</HI> &s;pends the thirty &s;ixth
and thirty &s;eventh and the following night in his return, and
meets <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in the morning of the thirty eighth day. This re|mark
is nece&s;&s;ary to avoid confu&s;ion, and to make the two &s;tories
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Telemachus</HI> coincide, in this and the next book of

There is undoubtedly a great plea&s;ure in the remembrance of pa&s;t

why pa&s;t evils delight, is from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the

The words in <HI>Homer</HI> are <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <HI>&s;olis conver&s;iones.</HI>

be ridiculous, &s;ince <HI>Pherecydes</HI> flouri&s;h'd three hundred years after

at any difficulty about the &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age; <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> proves

above <HI>Ortygia,</HI> on that &s;ide where the Sun &s;ets, or we&s;terly, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
'Tis true, <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> mentions
a bower, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, in which the conver&s;ions of the Sun were
figur'd. This indeed would fully vindicate <HI>Homer;</HI> but <HI>Bochart</HI>
and others affirm, that <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> is in an error, and that <HI>Syros</HI> is
&s;o far from lying to the we&s;t, or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, that it
<PB N="57" REF="57">
bears an ea&s;tern po&s;ition both with re&s;pect to <HI>Ithaca</HI> and <HI>Delos:</HI>
How is this objection to be an&s;wer'd? <HI>Bochart, p.</HI> 411 of his
<HI>Geographia &s;acra,</HI> explains it by having recour&s;e to the bower
mention'd by <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> in which the motions of the Sun were
drawn. <HI>Pherecydes</HI> (&s;ays <HI>He&s;ychius Mile&s;ius</HI>) having collected the
writings of the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> from the u&s;e of them alone without
any in&s;tructor, became famous in the world by the &s;trength of
his own genius: And <HI>Laertius</HI> writes, that an <HI>Heliotrope</HI> made
by him was pre&s;erv'd in the I&s;land of <HI>Syros.</HI> Thus it is evident,
that he borrow'd his knowledge from the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> and pro|bably
his skill in A&s;tronomy, they being very expert in that &s;ci|ence,
by rea&s;on of its u&s;e in their navigation. Why then might
there not be a machine which exhibited the motions of the Sun,
made by the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> and why might not <HI>Homer</HI> be acquaint|ed
with it? It is probable that <HI>Pherecydes</HI> took his pattern from
this <HI>Heliotrope,</HI> which being one of the greate&s;t rarities of an|tiquity,
might give a great reputation to <HI>Syros,</HI> and con&s;equent|ly
was worthy to be celebrated by <HI>Homer,</HI> the great pre&s;erver of
Antiquities. <HI>Fallitur igitur,</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Bochart</HI>) <HI>Eu&s;tathius, c&ugrave;m vult intelligi,

dici potuit fal&s;ius, &s;i Syrus &s;it ad occa&s;um Deli.</HI> If this an&s;wer
appears to any per&s;on too &s;tudied and ab&s;tru&s;e, the difficulty may
be &s;olv'd, by &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Eumaeus</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Delos</HI> as it lay with
re&s;pect to <HI>Syrus,</HI> before he was carry'd from it; for in&s;tance, if
<HI>Syrus</HI> lies on the ea&s;t of <HI>Delos</HI> to a man in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> both <HI>Ithaca</HI>
and <HI>Delos</HI> will lie on the we&s;t of <HI>Syrus</HI> to one of that I&s;land; I

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>VERSE</HI> 1. Soon as the morning blu&s;h'd along the Plains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</P>
<P>_THIS Book opens with the greate&s;t &s;implicity
imaginable. <HI>Diony&s;ius Halicarn.</HI> quotes the &s;ix|teen
fir&s;t Lines to this purpo&s;e: The Poet,
&s;ays that Author, de&s;cribes a low and vulgar
action, yet gives it an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;weet|ne&s;s;
the ear is pleas'd with the harmony of
the Poetry, and yet there is nothing noble in
the &s;entiments. Whence, continues he, does
this ari&s;e? from the choice of the words, or from the placing of
them? No one will affirm that it con&s;i&s;ts in the choice of the
words, for the diction is entirely low and vulgar, &s;o vulgar that
a common Artificer or Pea&s;ant, who never &s;tudied elocution,
wou'd u&s;e it in conver&s;ation; turn the Ver&s;es into Pro&s;e, and this
will appear. There are no tran&s;po&s;itions, no figures, no variety
of dialect, nor any new and &s;tudied expre&s;&s;ions. Where then is
the beauty of the Poetry? It mu&s;t be entirely a&s;crib'd to the har|monious
<PB N="96" REF="94">
juncture and po&s;ition of the words; and he concludes
that the <HI>collocation</HI> of words has a greater efficacy both in Pro&s;e and
Poetry, than the <HI>choice.</HI> And indeed a judicious Di&s;po&s;ition of them
(like what is feign'd of <HI>Minerva</HI> in this Book) makes a mean, de|form'd,
and vulgar period, ri&s;e, like <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> from beggary, into pomp
and dignity. This may be exemplify'd from the rules of mechanic
a$ts: an Architect, when he gathers his materials for a building,
has the&s;e three things chiefly in view: fir&s;t, with what piece of
&s;tone, wood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a corre&s;pondent piece will be&s;t agree: next
he con&s;iders their &s;everal formations, and how it will be&s;t &s;tand in
the &s;tructure; and la&s;tly, if any part of the materials &s;uits not
with the allotted place, he rejects it or new &s;hapes it, till it agrees
with the whole work: The &s;ame care is to be taken by a good
writer: he is fir&s;t to con&s;ider what Noun or Verb is to be join'd
to other Nouns or Verbs &s;o fitly, as not po&s;&s;ibly to be
plac'd more conveniently; for a promi&s;cuous connecting of
words indi&s;criminately &s;poils both Pro&s;e and Poetry: Next he
con&s;iders the frame and turn of the Verb or Noun, and how it
will &s;tand in the place he allots it; and if it &s;uits not exactly, he
changes it, &s;ometimes by varying the Numbers, &s;ometimes the
Ca&s;es, and at other times the Genders: And la&s;tly, if a word
prove &s;o &s;tubborn as not to bend to the level of the period, he
entirely rejects it, and introduces another that pre&s;erves a due
conformity; or at lea&s;t, if an inharmonious word be nece&s;&s;ary,
he places it &s;o judiciou&s;ly between more agreeable and tuneful
words, that their harmony &s;teals away our imagination from ob|&s;erving
the roughne&s;s of the others: Like wi&s;e Generals, who
in ordering the ranks of their Soldiers, &s;trengthen the weaker files
by &s;u&s;taining them with the &s;tronger; and by this method render
the whole invincible. See likewi&s;e <HI>Cap.</HI> 32. of <HI>Longinus,</HI> of the

But we are not therefore to imagine that this was an unu&s;ual meal;

&startq;At the dawn of the day they took repa&s;t and arm'd them|&s;elves

<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
<HI>Homer,</HI> adds <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> mentions a fourth repa&s;t, <HI>Lib.</HI> 17 of the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI>
<Q>&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
This the <HI>Romans</HI> called <HI>comme&s;&s;ationem,</HI> we a collation, a repa&s;t
taken, as the &s;ame Author explains it, between dinner and &s;up|per;
the word is deriv'd <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <HI>the evening
twilight.</HI> But <HI>Athenaeus</HI> refutes him&s;elf, <HI>lib.</HI> 5. <HI>p.</HI> 193. I have
already (&s;ays he) ob&s;erv'd that the Antients eat thrice a-day; and
'tis ridiculous to imagine that they eat four times, from the&s;e
words of <HI>Homer,</HI>
<Q><PB N="98" REF="96">
&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
For that expre&s;&s;ion means only that <HI>Eumaeus</HI> &s;hould return in the
evening, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. But this is not the full im|port
of the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, for it undoubtedly means, To take
the evening repa&s;t or &s;upper, as is evident from the conclu&s;ion of
the &s;eventeenth Book of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey: Return,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Telemachus</HI> to
<HI>Eumaeus, but fir&s;t take refre&s;hment;</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus</HI> accordingly eats,
and the Poet immediately adds, <HI>becau&s;e the Evening was come,</HI> or
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. However in no &s;en&s;e can this word be brought
to prove that the <HI>Greeks</HI> eat four times in the day; but if any
per&s;on will imagine that it &s;ignifies in that place an immediate
meal, all that can be gather'd from it is, that <HI>Telemachus</HI> out of
kindne&s;s to <HI>Eumaeus</HI> commands him to eat before the u&s;ual hour
of repa&s;t, before he leaves his palace; but <HI>He&s;ychius</HI> rightly in|terprets
it by <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> that is, <HI>eating his &s;upper;</HI>
for as <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;ignify the dinner, &s;o <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">

<P>VERSE 14. <HI>Drop'd the full bowl</HI>]&mdash;In the original it is,
<HI>Eumaeus</HI> drop'd the bowl as he temper'd it with water. It was
cu&s;tomary not to drink wine unmix'd among&s;t the ancients:
there was no certain proportion ob&s;erv'd in the mixture; &s;ome
to one ve&s;&s;el of wine pour'd in two of water, others to two of
wine, five of water. <HI>Homer</HI> tells us that the wine of <HI>Maron</HI> was
&s;o &s;trong as to require twenty mea&s;ures of water to one of wine;
but perhaps this is &s;poken hyperbolically, to &s;hew the uncom|mon
&s;trength of it. The <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> us'd to boil their wine
till the fifth part was con&s;um'd, and then keeping it four
years, drank it: but &s;ometimes the <HI>Grecians</HI> drank it without

water (but this they call'd reproachfully <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or to act like
a <HI>Scythian,</HI> from whom they borrow'd the cu&s;tom.) It was u&s;ual

<HI>Homer</HI> intended to give us the picture of a compleat Heroe in
his two Poems, drawn from the characters of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:
Achilles</HI> has con&s;ummate valour, but wants the wi&s;dom of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:
Uly&s;&s;es</HI> has courage, but courage inclining to caution and &s;trata|gem,
as much as that of <HI>Achilles</HI> to ra&s;hne&s;s. <HI>Virgil</HI> endeavour'd

the forward Courage of <HI>Achilles</HI> with the wi&s;dom of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and
by this conduct gives us a perfect character. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation
holds good with re&s;pect to the &s;ubordinate characters introduc'd
into the two Poems of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey;</HI> and makes an e&s;|&s;ential
difference between them: Thus the <HI>Iliad</HI> exhibiting an
<PB N="102" REF="100">
example of heroic valour, almo&s;t all the characters are violent
and heroic. <HI>Diomed, Ajax, Hector,</HI> &amp;c. are all chiefly remarkable
for courage: But the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> being intended to repre&s;ent the pa|tience
and wi&s;dom of an Heroe, almo&s;t all the characters are
di&s;tingui&s;h'd by benevolence and humanity. <HI>Telemachus</HI> and
<HI>Eumaeus, Alcinous, Ne&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Menelaus</HI> are every where repre&s;ented
in the mild light of wi&s;dom and ho&s;pitality. This makes a con|tinued
difference of &s;tyle in the Poetry of the two Poems, and the
characters of the agents in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> nece&s;&s;arily exhibit lectures
of piety and morality: The Reader &s;hould keep this in his view.
In reading <HI>Homer,</HI> the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> is to be look'd upon as a &s;equel of
the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and then he will find in the two Poems the perfection
of human nature, Con&s;ummate courage join'd with con&s;ummate
piety. He mu&s;t be an unob&s;erving Reader, who has not taken
notice of that <HI>Vein of humanity</HI> that runs thro' the whole <HI>Ody&s;|&s;ey;</HI>
and a bad man, that has not been pleas'd with it. In my
Opinion, <HI>Eumaeus</HI> tending his herds is more amiable than <HI>Achilles</HI>
in all his de&s;tructive Glory. There is &s;carce a &s;peech made in
the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> by <HI>Eumaeus, Telemachus</HI> or <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> but what tends to
the improvement of mankind: It was this that endear'd the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> to the ancients, and <HI>Homer</HI>'s &s;entences of morality were
in every mouth, and introduc'd in all conver&s;ation for the bet|ter
conduct of human life. This Ver&s;e was thus apply'd by
&s;ome of the ancients; a per&s;on being ask'd what was the Duty
of an Orator, or Pleader, an&s;wer'd from <HI>Homer,</HI>
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
In &s;hort, I will not deny but that the <HI>Iliad</HI> is by far the nobler
Poem, with re&s;pect to the Poetry; it is fit to be read by Kings
and Heroes; but the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> is of u&s;e to all mankind, as it

imperfection, for this would be a degradation unworthy of

I mu&s;t offer a remark in oppo&s;ition to that of <HI>Dacier</HI> upon this place:
&startq;This fear of <HI>Telemachus</HI> (&s;ays that Author) proceeds from the
opinion of the Ancients when the Gods came down vi&s;ibly;
they thought them&s;elves &s;o unworthy of &s;uch a manife&s;tation,
that whenever it happen'd, they believ'd they &s;hould die, or
meet with &s;ome great calamity:&endq; Thus the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> addre&s;s
<HI>Mo&s;es; Speak thou to us, and we will hear, but let not the Lord
&s;peak to us, le&s;t we die.</HI> Thus al&s;o <HI>Gideon; Alas! O Lord, my
God, becau&s;e I have &s;een an Angel of the Lord face to face, and
the Lord &s;aid to him, fear not, thou &s;halt not die.</HI> Hence it is ve|ry
evident, that this notion prevail'd among&s;t the <HI>I&s;raelites:</HI> But
how does it appear that the <HI>Greeks</HI> held the &s;ame opinion? The
contrary is manife&s;t almo&s;t to a demon&s;tration: the Gods are
introduced almo&s;t in every book both of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey;</HI> and
yet there is not the lea&s;t foundation for &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion: nay,
<HI>Telemachus</HI> him&s;elf in the &s;econd book returns thanks to <HI>Minerva</HI>
for appearing to him, and prays for a &s;econd vi&s;ion.
<PB N="109" REF="107">

It is not to be imagin'd that <HI>Telemachus</HI> would have pre|ferr'd
this prayer, if the pre&s;ence of the Deity denoted death, or
&s;ome great calamity; and all the Heroes throughout the <HI>Iliad</HI>

<P>VERSE 238. <HI>As the bold eagle</HI>&mdash;] This is a beautiful
compari&s;on; but to take its full force, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve
the nature of this <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <HI>vultur: Homer</HI> does not compare <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es</HI>
to that bird merely for its dignity, it being of the Aquiline
kind, and therefore the King of birds; but from the knowledge
of the nature of it, which doubles the beauty of the allu&s;ion:
This bird is remarkable for the love it bears towards its young:
<HI>Tearing open her own thigh, &s;he feeds her young with her own
blood:</HI> Thus al&s;o another Author;

<HI>Femore ex&s;ecto, &s;anguineo lactis defluxu, &s;uos foetus refocillant.</HI> And
the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> made the vultur their hieroglyphic, to repre&s;ent
a compa&s;&s;ionate nature. This gives a rea&s;on why this bird is
introduc'd with peculiar propriety to repre&s;ent the fondne&s;s of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> for <HI>Telemachus.</HI> But where is the point of the &s;imilitude?
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> embraces his &s;on, but the vultur is &s;aid to mourn the
lo&s;s of her young: <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> an&s;wers, that the &s;orrow alone,
and vehemence of it, is intended to be illu&s;trated by the compa|ri&s;on;
I think he &s;hould have added the affection <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> bears to
<HI>Telemachus.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that <HI>Homer</HI> in&s;erts very few &s;imilitudes in his
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> tho' they occur frequently almo&s;t in every book of the
<HI>Iliad.</HI> The <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> is wrote with more &s;implicity, and con&s;equent|ly
there is le&s;e room for allu&s;ions. If we ob&s;erve the &s;imiles
them&s;elves in&s;erted in each Poem, we &s;hall find the &s;ame diffe|rence:
In the <HI>Iliad</HI> they are drawn from lions, &s;torms, torrents,
conflagrations, thunder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> from lower objects,
from an heap of thorns, from a &s;hipwright plying the wimble,
an armourer tempering iron, a matron weeping over her dying
husband, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Similes are likewi&s;e generally longer in the
<HI>Iliad</HI> than the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> and le&s;s re&s;emblance between the thing il|lu&s;trated,
and the illu&s;tration; the rea&s;on is, in the <HI>Iliad</HI> the &s;imi|litudes
are introduced to illu&s;trate &s;ome great and noble object, and
therefore the Poet proceeds till he has rais'd &s;ome noble image to
inflame the mind of the Reader; whereas in the&s;e calmer &s;cenes
the Poet keeps clo&s;er to the point of allu&s;ion, and needs only to
repre&s;ent the object, to render it entertaining: By the former con|duct
he rai&s;es our admiration above the &s;ubject, by adding foreign
embelli&s;hments; in the latter, he brings the copy as clo&s;e as po&s;|&s;ible
to the original, to po&s;&s;e&s;s us with a true and equal image
of it.</P>
<P>It has been objected by a <HI>French</HI> Critic, that <HI>Homer</HI> is blame|able
for too great a length in his &s;imilitudes; that in the heat of
an action he &s;tops &s;hort, and turns to &s;ome allu&s;ion, which calls
off our attention from the main &s;ubject. 'Tis true, compari&s;ons
ought not to be too long, and are not to be plac'd in the heat
<PB N="111" REF="109">
of an action, as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> ob&s;erves, but when it begins to de|cline:
Thus in the fir&s;t <HI>Aeneis,</HI> when the &s;torm is in its fury, the
Poet introduces no compari&s;on, becau&s;e nothing can be more
impetuous than the &s;torm it &s;elf; but when the heat of the de|&s;cription
abates, then le&s;t we &s;hould cool too &s;oon, he renews it
by &s;ome proper &s;imilitude, which &s;till keeps up our attention and
fixes the whole upon our minds. The &s;imilitude before us is thus
placed at the conclu&s;ion of the Heroe's lamentation, and the Poet
by this method leaves the whole deeply fix'd upon the memory.
<HI>Virgil</HI> has imitated this compari&s;on in his fourth <HI>Georgic,</HI> but
very judiciou&s;ly &s;ub&s;tituted the nightingale in the place of
the vultur, that bird being introduced to repre&s;ent the mourn|ful
mu&s;ic of <HI>Orpheus.</HI>
<Q><L>Qualis popule&acirc; moerens Philomela &s;ub umbr&acirc;</L>

<L>Flet noctem, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
Nothing can be &s;weeter than this compari&s;on of <HI>Virgil,</HI> but the
learned <HI>Huetius</HI> thinks he has found a notorious blunder in it:
This nightingale (&s;ays he) in the fir&s;t line &s;its in the &s;hade of a
poplar, and yet in the fourth &s;he mourns by night, <HI>flet noctem.</HI>
It is evident that Mon&s;. <HI>Huet</HI> mi&s;takes the word <HI>umbra</HI> for the
&s;hade of the tree, which it ca&s;ts while the &s;un &s;hines upon it;
whereas it only means that the bird &s;ings <HI>&s;ub foliis,</HI> or conceal'd
in the leaves of it, which may be done by night as well as by
day: But if it be thought that this is not a &s;ufficient an&s;wer,
the pa&s;&s;age may be thus under&s;tood; The nightingale mourn|ing
under the &s;hade of a poplar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> cea&s;es not all night, or
<HI>flet noctem;</HI> that is, &s;he begins her &s;ong in the evening by day,
but mourns all night. Either of the&s;e an&s;wers are &s;ufficient for
<HI>Virgil</HI>'s vindication.</P>

<P>VERSE 245. <HI>The Prince thus interrupts the &s;olemn woe.</HI>] It
does not appear at fir&s;t view why the Poet makes <HI>Telemachus</HI> reco|ver
him&s;elf from his tran&s;port of &s;orrow &s;ooner than <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> Is
<HI>Telemachus</HI> a greater ma&s;ter of his pa&s;&s;ions? or is it to convince
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> of his &s;on's wi&s;dom, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> conjectures? this can
&s;carce be &s;uppos'd, <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> being &s;uperior in wi&s;dom. I would
chu&s;e rather to a&s;cribe it to human nature; for it has been ob|&s;erved,
that affection &s;eldom &s;o &s;trongly a&s;cends, as it de&s;cends;
the child &s;eldom loves the father &s;o tenderly, as the father the
child: This ob&s;ervation has been made from the remote&s;t Anti|quity.
And it is wi&s;ely de&s;ign'd by the great Author of our Na|tures;
for in the common cour&s;e of life, the child mu&s;t bury the
parent; it is therefore a merciful di&s;pen&s;ation, that the tye of
blood and affection &s;hould be loo&s;en'd by degrees, and not torn
violently a&s;under in the full &s;trength of it. It is expected that aged
per&s;ons &s;hould dye, their lo&s;s therefore grows more familiar to us,
and it lo&s;es much of its horror thro' the long expectation of it.</P>

This whole di&s;cour&s;e between <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Telemachus</HI> is introduc'd
to prepare the Reader for the Cata&s;trophe of the Poem: <HI>Homer</HI>
judiciou&s;ly intere&s;ts Heaven in the cau&s;e, that the Reader may
not be &s;urpriz'd at the event, when he &s;ees &s;uch numbers fall by
the hands of the&s;e Heroes; he con&s;ults probability, and as the
Poem now draws to a conclu&s;ion, &s;ets the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Hea|ven
full before the Reader.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e very artful to let us into &s;ome knowledge of the
event of the Poem; all care mu&s;t be taken that it be rather gue&s;s'd
than known. If it be entirely known, the Reader finds nothing
new to awaken his attention; if on the contrary it be &s;o intri|cate,
that the event cannot po&s;&s;ibly be gue&s;&s;ed at, we wander in
the dark, and are lo&s;t in uncertainty. The art of the Poet
con&s;i&s;ts not in concealing the event entirely; but when it
is in &s;ome mea&s;ure fore&s;een, in introducing &s;uch a number of
incidents that now bring us almo&s;t into &s;ight of it, then
by new ob&s;tacles perplex the &s;tory to the very conclu&s;ion of the
Poem; every ob&s;tacle, and every removal of it, fills us with &s;ur|prize,
<PB N="114" REF="112">
with plea&s;ure or pain alternately, and con&s;equently calls up
our whole attention. This is admirably de&s;crib'd by <HI>Vida, lib.</HI> 2.

The conduct both of <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> are agreeable to this ob|&s;ervation;
for in&s;tance, <HI>Anchi&s;es</HI> and <HI>Tire&s;ias</HI> in the &s;hades, fore|tel

that the one &s;hall found the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, the other re|gain
his kingdoms; but the means being kept conceal'd, our ap|petite
is rather whetted than cloy'd, to know by what means
the&s;e events are brought about: Thus, as in <HI>Vida</HI>'s allu&s;ion, they
&s;how us the City at a great di&s;tance, but how we are to arrive
at it, by what roads they intend to guide us to it, this they keep
conceal'd; the journey di&s;covers it &s;elf, and every &s;tep we ad|vance
leads us forward, and &s;hews where we are to take the next;
neither does the Poet directly lead us in the &s;trait path, &s;ome|times
we are as it were in a labyrinth, and we know not how to
extricate our &s;elves out of it; &s;ometimes he carries us into by|ways,
and we almo&s;t lo&s;e &s;ight of the direct way, and then &s;ud|denly
they open into the chief road, and convey us to the jour|ney's

end. In this con&s;i&s;ts the skill of the Poet; he mu&s;t form
probable intricacies, and then &s;olve them probably; he mu&s;t &s;et
his Heroe in dangers, and then bring him out of them with honour.
This ob&s;ervation is nece&s;&s;ary to be apply'd to all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> where the event of it is ob&s;curely foretold, and which

<P>VERSE 391. <HI>The</HI> Greeks, <HI>aver&s;e too ju&s;tly to our cau&s;e.</HI>] This
ver&s;e is in&s;erted with great judgment, and gives an air of proba|bility
to the whole relation; for if it be ask'd why the Suitors
defer to &s;eize the &s;upreme power, and to murder <HI>Telemachus,</HI> they
being &s;o &s;uperior in number? <HI>Antinous</HI> him&s;elf an&s;wers, that they
fear the people, who favour the cau&s;e of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and would
revenge his injuries: 'Tis for this rea&s;on that they form'd the am|bu&s;h
by &s;ea; and for this rea&s;on <HI>Antinous</HI> propo&s;es to intercept
him in his return from the country: they dare not offer open
violence, and therefore make u&s;e of treachery. This &s;peech of
<HI>Antinous</HI> forms a &s;hort under-plot to the Poem; it gives us pain
(&s;ays <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI>) for <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and holds us in &s;u&s;pen&s;e till the
intimacy is unravell'd by <HI>Amphinomus.</HI></P>
<P>The whole harangue is admirable in <HI>Homer:</HI> the diction is
excellently &s;uited to the temper of <HI>Antinous,</HI> who &s;peaks with
precipitation: His mind is in agitation and di&s;order, and con|&s;equently
his language is abrupt, and not allowing him&s;elf time
to explain his thoughts at full length, he falls into elleip&s;es and
abbreviations. For in&s;tance, he is to &s;peak again&s;t <HI>Telemachus,</HI>
but his contempt and re&s;entment will not permit him to menti|on
his name, he therefore calls him <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; thus in <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">

the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, mu&s;t be under&s;tood, to

<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, to make <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in the next &s;entence begin it &s;ignifi|cantly,

mu&s;t be con&s;tru'd like <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; and la&s;tly, to image
the di&s;order of <HI>Antinous</HI> more &s;trongly, <HI>Homer</HI> in&s;erts a fal&s;e quan|tity,
by making the fir&s;t &s;yllable in <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;hort. <HI>Antinous</HI> at|tends
not, thro' the violence of his &s;pirit, to the words he utters,
and therefore falls into this error, which excellently repre&s;ents it.
It is impo&s;&s;ible to retain the&s;e Elleip&s;es in the tran&s;lation, but I
have endeavour'd to &s;how the warmth of the &s;peaker, by put|ting

this Ver&s;e <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> recites one that is omitted in mo&s;t of
the late editions as &s;purious, at lea&s;t improper.
<PB N="122" REF="120">
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
That is, <HI>Medon</HI> was out of the court, whereas the Suitors form'd
their council within it: The line is really to be &s;u&s;pected; for a
little above, <HI>Homer</HI> directly tells us, that the Suitors left the Pa|lace.
<Q><L>Then i&s;&s;uing from the dome, before the gate</L>
<L>With clouded looks, a pale a&s;&s;embly &s;ate.</L></Q>
It is likewi&s;e very evident that they &s;tood in the open air, for
they di&s;cover the &s;hip returning from the ambu&s;h, and &s;ailing into
the bay. How then can it be &s;aid of the Suitors, that they form'd
their a&s;&s;embly in the court, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Be&s;ides,
continues <HI>Dacier,</HI> they left the palace, and placed them&s;elves un|der
the lofty wall of it.
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
How then is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the &s;hip entring the port, when
this wall mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ob&s;truct the &s;ight? The two ver&s;es there|fore
evidently contradict them&s;elves, and one of them mu&s;t con&s;e|quently
be rejected: &s;he would have the line read thus;
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &amp;c.</Q>
But all the difficulty vani&s;hes by taking <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, as it is frequently
u&s;ed, to denote any place open to the air, and con&s;equently not
the court, but the court-yard, and this is the proper &s;ignification
of the word. Then <HI>Medon</HI> may &s;tand on the out&s;ide of the wall
of the court-yard, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and over-hear the debates of the
Suitors who form their council within it, or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
And as for the wall intercepting the view of the Suitors,
this is merely conjecture; and 'tis more rational to imagine that
the court-yard was open &s;eaward, that &s;o beautiful a pro&s;pect as
<PB N="123" REF="121">

There is an obvious and a latent Interpretation; for in|&s;tance,
when he &s;ays,
<PB N="124" REF="122">
<Q>His blood in vengeance &s;mokes upon my &s;pear;</Q>
it obviou&s;ly means the blood of the per&s;on who offers violence

and the con&s;truction admits both interpretations: Thus al&s;o when
he &s;ays, that no per&s;on &s;hall lay hands upon <HI>Telemachus,</HI> while he

<Q><L>Then fear no mortal arm: if heav'n de&s;troy,</L>
<L>We mu&s;t re&s;ign; for Man is born to die.</L></Q>
the apparent &s;ignification is, that <HI>Telemachus</HI> has occa&s;ion only
to fear a natural death; but he means if the oracle of <HI>Jupiter</HI>
commands them to de&s;troy <HI>Telemachus,</HI> that then the Suitors will
take away his life. He alludes to the foregoing &s;peech of <HI>Am|phinomus:</HI>

call'd the <HI>Hermaean</HI> hill, either becau&s;e there was a Temple,
Statue, or Altar of <HI>Mercury</HI> upon it; and &s;o call'd from
that Deity.</P>
<P>It has been written that <HI>Mercury</HI> being the Me&s;&s;enger of
the Gods, in his frequent journeys clear'd the roads, and when he
found any &s;tones, he threw them in an heap out of the way, and
the&s;e heaps were call'd <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <HI>Mercuries.</HI> The circum&s;tance of

<PB N="125" REF="123">

in publick ways, becau&s;e he was &s;uppos'd to frequent them
as the Me&s;&s;enger of the Gods?</P>
<P>This book takes up no more time than the &s;pace of the thirty
eighth day; for <HI>Telemachus</HI> reaches the lodge of <HI>Eumaeus</HI> in the
morning, a little after he di&s;patches <HI>Eumaeus</HI> to <HI>Penelope,</HI> who
returns in the evening of the &s;ame day. The book in general
is very beautiful in the original; the di&s;covery of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to <HI>Tele|machus</HI>
is particularly tender and affecting: It has &s;ome re&s;em|blance
with that of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s di&s;covery of him&s;elf to his brethren,
and it may not perhaps be di&s;agreeable to &s;ee how two &s;uch Au|thors
de&s;cribe the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion. <HI>I am</HI> Jo&s;eph, <HI>I am your brother</HI>
Jo&s;eph.
<Q><L>I am <HI>Uly&s;&s;es, I,</HI> my Son! am he!</L>
<L>and he wept aloud, and he fell on his brother's neck and wept.</L>
<L>He wept abundant, and he wept aloud.</L></Q>
But it mu&s;t be owned that <HI>Homer</HI> falls infinitely &s;hort of <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI>
He mu&s;t be a very wicked man, that can read the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI>
without the utmo&s;t touches of compa&s;&s;ion and tran&s;port.
There is a maje&s;tic &s;implicity in the whole relation, and &s;uch an
affecting portrait of human nature, that it overwhelms us with
vici&s;&s;itudes of joy and &s;orrow. This is a pregnant in&s;tance how
much the be&s;t of heathen Writers is inferior to the divine Hi&s;to|rian,
upon a parallel &s;ubject, where the two Authors endeavour
to move the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions. The &s;ame may with equal truth be
&s;aid in re&s;pect to Sublimity; not only in the in&s;tance produced
by <HI>Longinus, viz. Let there be light, and there was light. Let the
earth be made, and the earth was made:</HI> but in general, in the
more elevated parts of Scripture, and particularly the whole book
of <HI>Job;</HI> which, with regard both to &s;ublimity of thought, and
morality, exceeds beyond all compari&s;on the mo&s;t noble parts of
<HI>Homer.</HI></P>

to another act of virtue toward <HI>Theoclymenus,</HI> whom he had

up her devotions for &s;ucce&s;s, and thanks for his return. It is
he who pre&s;cribes the manner of it; namely, by wa&s;hing the hands,
in token of the purity of mind requir'd by tho&s;e who &s;uppli|cate
the Deities; and by putting on clean garments, to &s;hew

This whole Epi&s;ode has fallen under the ridicule of the Cri|tics;
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Perault</HI> in particular: &startq;The Dunghil before
the Palace (&s;ays that Author) is more proper for a Pea&s;ant than
a King; and it is beneath the dignity of Poetry to de&s;cribe the
Dog <HI>Argus</HI> almo&s;t devour'd with vermin.&endq; It mu&s;t be allow'd,
that &s;uch a familiar Epi&s;ode could not have been properly intro|duced
into the <HI>Iliad:</HI> It is writ in a nobler &s;tyle, and di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd
by a boldne&s;s of &s;entiments and diction; whereas the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> de&s;cends to the Familiar, and is calculated more for com|mon
than heroic life. What <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Argus</HI> is very natural,
and I do not know any thing more beautiful or more affecting
in the whole Poem: I dare appeal to every per&s;on's judgment,
if <HI>Argus</HI> be not as ju&s;tly and properly repre&s;ented, as the noble&s;t
figure in it. It is certain that the vermin which <HI>Homer</HI> mentions
would deba&s;e our Poetry, but in the <HI>Greek</HI> that very word is no|ble
and &s;onorous, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: But how is the objection con|cerning
the Dunghil to be an&s;wer'd? We mu&s;t have recour&s;e to
the &s;implicity of manners among&s;t the Ancients, who thought
nothing mean that was of u&s;e to life. <HI>Ithaca</HI> was a barren Coun|try,
full of Rocks and Mountains, and owed its fertility chiefly

has been thought to mean no more than the inherent wi&s;|dom
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> which guides all his actions upon all emergen|cies:
It is not impo&s;&s;ible but the Poet might intend to inculcate,
that the wi&s;dom of man is the gift of Heaven, and a ble&s;&s;ing
from the Gods. But then is it not a derogation to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> to
think nothing but what the Godde&s;s dictates? and a re&s;traint of
human liberty, to act &s;olely by the impul&s;e of a Deity? <HI>Plutarch</HI>
in his life of <HI>Coriolanus</HI> excellently &s;olves this difficulty. &startq;Men
(ob&s;erves that Author) are ready to cen&s;ure and de&s;pi&s;e the Poet,
as if he de&s;troy'd the u&s;e of rea&s;on, and the freedom of their
choice, by continually a&s;cribing every &s;ugge&s;tion of heart to
the influence of a Godde&s;s: Whereas he introduces a Deity
not to take away the liberty of the will, but as moving it
to act with freedom; the Deity does not work in us the in|clinations,
but only offers the object to our minds, from
whence we conceive the impul&s;e, and form our re&s;olutions.&endq;
However the&s;e influences do not make the action involuntary,
but only give a beginning to &s;pontaneous operations; for we
mu&s;t either remove God from all manner of cau&s;ality, or con|fe&s;s
that he invi&s;ibly a&s;&s;i&s;ts us by a &s;ecret co-operation. For it is
ab&s;urd to imagine that the help he lends us, con&s;i&s;ts in fa&s;hio|ning
the po&s;tures of the body, or directing the corporeal moti|ons;
but in influencing our &s;ouls, and exciting the inward facul|ties
into action by &s;ecret impul&s;es from above; or on the con|trary,
by rai&s;ing an aver&s;ion in the &s;oul, to re&s;train us from action.
'Tis true in ordinary affairs of life, in matters that are brought
about by the ordinary way of rea&s;on, <HI>Homer</HI> a&s;cribes the execu|tion
of them to human performance, and frequently repre&s;ents
his Heroes calling a council in their own brea&s;ts, and acting ac|cording
to the dictates of rea&s;on: But in actions unaccountably
daring, of a tran&s;cendent nature, there they are &s;aid to be car|ry'd
<PB N="184" REF="180">
away by a divine impul&s;e or enthu&s;ia&s;m, and it is no longer
human rea&s;on, but a God that influences the &s;oul.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that <HI>Homer</HI> makes u&s;e of Ma|chines
&s;ometimes meerly for ornament; this place is an in&s;tance
of it: Here is no action of an uncommon nature perform'd,
and yet <HI>Pallas</HI> directs <HI>Uly&s;&s;es: Plutarch</HI> very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that
whenever the Heroes of <HI>Homer</HI> execute any prodigious exploit of
valour, he continually introduces a Deity, who a&s;&s;i&s;ts in the per|formance
of it; but it is al&s;o true, that to &s;hew the dependance
of man upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven, he frequently a&s;cribes
the common dictates of wi&s;dom to the Godde&s;s of it. If we
take the act here in&s;pired by <HI>Minerva,</HI> as it lies nakedly in <HI>Homer,</HI>
it is no more than a bare command to beg; an act, that needs
not the wi&s;dom of a Godde&s;s to command: But we are to un|der&s;tand
it as a direction to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> how to behave before the
Suitors upon his fir&s;t appearance, how to carry on his di&s;gui&s;e
&s;o artfully as to prevent all &s;u&s;picions, and take his mea&s;ures &s;o
effectually as to work his own re-e&s;tabli&s;hment: In this light,
the command becomes worthy of a Godde&s;s: The act of beg|ging
is only the method by which he carries on his de&s;igns; the
con&s;equence of it is the main point in view, namely, the Suitors

<P>VERSE 557. <HI>Not for the hurt I grieve, but for the cau&s;e.</HI>]
The rea&s;oning of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in the original is not without &s;ome ob|&s;curity:
For how can it be affirm'd, that it is no great affliction
to have our property invaded, and to be wounded in the de|fence
of it? The beggar who &s;uffers for asking an alms, has no
injury done him, except the violence offer'd to his per&s;on; but
it is a double injury, to &s;uffer both in our per&s;ons and proper|ties.
We mu&s;t therefore &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> means, that the
importance of the cau&s;e, when our rights are invaded, is equal
to the danger, and that we ought to &s;uffer wounds, or even
death, in defence of it; and that a brave man grieves not at &s;uch
laudable adventures. Or perhaps <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;peaks only with re&s;pect
to <HI>Antinous,</HI> and means that it is a greater injury to offer vio|lence
to the poor and the &s;tranger, than to per&s;ons of greater
fortunes and &s;tation.</P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> gives a deeper meaning to the &s;peech of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI>
he applies it to his pre&s;ent condition, and it is the &s;ame as if
he had &s;aid openly, It would be no great matter if I had been
wounded in defence of my Palace, and other properties, but to
&s;uffer only for asking an alms, this is a deep affliction. So that
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;peaks in general, but intends his own particular conditi|on;
and the import of the whole is, I grieve to &s;uffer, not upon
any weighty account, but only for being poor and hungry.</P>

utter'd the&s;e words, <HI>Telemachus</HI> &s;neezes; <HI>Penelope</HI> accepts the omen,
and expects the words to be verify'd. The original of the veneration
paid to &s;neezing is this: The head is the mo&s;t &s;acred part of the
body, the &s;eat of thought and rea&s;on: now the &s;neeze coming
from the head, the Ancients look'd upon it as a &s;ign or omen,
and believ'd it to be &s;ent by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> therefore they regarded
it with a kind of adoration: The Reader will have a full idea
of the nature of the omen of &s;neezing here mention'd, from a
&s;ingular in&s;tance in <HI>lib.</HI> 3. of <HI>Xenophon,</HI> in his expedition of <HI>Cy|rus.
Xenophon</HI> having ended a &s;hort &s;peech to his &s;oldiers with
<PB N="190" REF="186">
the&s;e words, <HI>viz.</HI> &startq;We have many rea&s;ons to hope for pre&s;er|vation;.&endq; they were &s;carce utter'd, when a certain &s;oldier
&s;neez'd: the whole army took the omen&punc; and at once paid ado|ration
to the Gods; then <HI>Xenophon</HI> re&s;uming his di&s;cour&s;e, pro|ceeded,
&startq;Since, my fellow-&s;oldiers, at the mention of our pre|&s;ervation,
<HI>Jupiter</HI> has &s;ent this omen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq; So that <HI>Xenophon</HI>

<Q><L>Num tibi na&s;centi primis, mea vita, diebus</L>

We find in all the&s;e in&s;tances that &s;neezing was con&s;tantly re|ceiv'd
as a good omen, or a &s;ign of approbation from the Gods.
In the&s;e ages we pay an idle &s;uper&s;tition to &s;neezing, but it is
ever look'd upon as a bad omen, and we cry <HI>God ble&s;s you,</HI> upon
hearing it, as the <HI>Greeks</HI> in latter times &s;aid <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
We are told this cu&s;tom aro&s;e from a mortal di&s;temper that affe|cted
the head, and threw the patient into convul&s;ive &s;neezings,

<P>The &s;neezing likewi&s;e gives us the rea&s;on why <HI>Penelope</HI> imme|diately
commands <HI>Eumaeus</HI> to introduce the beggar into her pre|&s;ence;
the omen gave her hopes to hear of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> &s;he &s;aw the

<P>_<HI>HOMER</HI> has been &s;everely blam'd for de&s;cribing
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> a King, entring the li&s;ts with a beg|gar:
<HI>Rapin</HI> affirms, that he demeans him&s;elf
by engaging with an unequal adver&s;ary.
The objection would be unan&s;werable, if
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> appear'd in his royal character: But
it is as nece&s;&s;ary in Epic Poetry as on the
Theatre, to adapt the behaviour of every
per&s;on to the character he is to repre&s;ent, whether real or imagi|nary.
Would it not have been ridiculous to have repre&s;ented
him, while he was di&s;guis'd in the garb of a beggar, refu&s;ing the
combat, becau&s;e he knew him&s;elf to be a King? and would not
&s;uch a conduct have endanger'd a di&s;covery? Ought we not ra|ther
to look upon this Epi&s;ode as an in&s;tance of the greatne&s;s of
the calamities of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who is reduced to &s;uch uncommon ex|tremities
as to be &s;et upon a level with the meane&s;t of wretches?</P>

<P>VERSE 8. <HI>She nam'd</HI> Arnaeus&mdash;] It &s;eems probable from
this pa&s;&s;age, that the mother gave the name to the child in the
days of <HI>Homer;</HI> tho' perhaps not without the concurrence of the
father: Thus in the &s;criptures it is &s;aid of <HI>Leah,</HI> that <HI>&s;he bare a
&s;on and called his name Reuben;</HI> and again, <HI>&s;he called his name Simeon;</HI>
and the &s;ame is frequently repeated both of <HI>Leah</HI> and <HI>Rachel.</HI> In
the age of <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> the giving a name to the child &s;eems to
have been a divided prerogative between the father and mother:
For in his <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> there is a di&s;pute between <HI>Strep&s;iades</HI> and his
wife, concerning the name of their &s;on: The wife was of noble
birth, and would therefore give him a noble name; the husband
was a plain villager, and was rather for a name that denoted
frugality: but the woman not waving the lea&s;t branch of her
prerogative, they compromis'd the affair, by giving the child a
compounded name that imply'd both frugality and chivalry, deri|ved
from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>to &s;pare,</HI> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>an hor&s;e;</HI> and the young
Cavalier's name was <HI>Phidippides. Eu&s;tathius</HI> affirms, that anciently
the mother nam'd the child; and the Scholia&s;t upon <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI>
in <HI>avib.</HI> quotes a fragment from <HI>Euripides</HI> to this purpo&s;e, from
a Play call'd <HI>Aegeus.</HI>
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
<HI>What was the name given on the tenth day by the mother to the
child? Dacier</HI> tells us, that the name of <HI>Arnaeus</HI> was prophetic
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>from the &s;heep the glutton would devour when he
came to manhood;</HI> but this is mere fancy, and it is no rea&s;on be|cau&s;e
he prov'd a glutton, that therefore the name foretold it:
One might rather think the fondne&s;s of the mother toward her
infant, &s;ugge&s;ted a very different view: She gave the name ac|cording
to her wi&s;hes, and flatter'd her&s;elf that he would prove
a very rich man, <HI>a man of many flocks or herds;</HI> and therefore &s;he
call'd him <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: and this is the more probable, becau&s;e all

between two beggars into &s;ome dignity, by requiring the &s;anction

The tradition concerning <HI>Echetus</HI> &s;tands thus: he was King

and told her &s;he &s;hould recover her &s;ight when &s;he had ground
the iron into flour. He invited <HI>Aechmodicus</HI> to an entertainment,
and cut off the extremities from all parts of his body, and ca&s;t

There never was a finer lecture of Morality read in any of the

<HI>Amphinomus;</HI> he u&s;hers it in with great &s;olemnity, and &s;peaks to

<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> quote it; and <HI>Plutarch</HI> twice refers

mind, and the calamities incident to the body; and upon a re|view
of all mortal creatures, he attributes to man the un|happy
&s;uperiority in mi&s;eries. But indeed <HI>Homer</HI> is &s;o plain
that he needs no interpretation, and any words but his own
mu&s;t di&s;grace him. Be&s;ides, this &s;peech is beautiful in ano|ther
view, and excellently &s;ets forth the forgiving temper of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> He &s;aw that all the &s;parks of virtue and humanity
were not extingui&s;h'd in <HI>Amphinomus;</HI> he therefore warns him
with great &s;olemnity to for&s;ake the Suitors; he imprints con|viction

This is &s;olely the act of <HI>Minerva;</HI> for <HI>Penelope</HI> is ignorant that

terms: here is no room for art or de&s;ign, becau&s;e &s;he is igno|rant
that &s;he &s;peaks before <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> and therefore her words mu&s;t

hour. But then it may be objected, if <HI>Penelope's</HI> &s;ole de|&s;ign
was to give a fal&s;e hope to the Suitors, does &s;he not take
a very wrong method, by &s;peaking &s;o very tenderly of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es?</HI>

<L>To the ble&s;t Gods&mdash;]</L></Q>
We have already ob&s;erved that libations were made to the Gods
before and after meals; here we &s;ee the Suitors offer their eve|ning
libation before they retire to repo&s;e. We are not to a&s;cribe
this religious act to the piety of the&s;e debauchees, but to the cu|&s;toms
of the times; they practi&s;e not true religion, but only the
exteriours of it; they are not pious, but fa&s;hionable.</P>
<P>The action of this book is comprehended in a very &s;hort du|ration
of time; it begins towards the clo&s;e of the day, and
ends at the time when the Suitors withdraw to repo&s;e; this is
the evening and part of the night of the thirty-ninth day.</P>
<P>In general, this book is in the <HI>Greek</HI> very beautiful: The combat
between <HI>Irus</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is naturally de&s;crib'd; it is indeed be|tween
beggars, but yet not without dignity, it being almo&s;t of the &s;ame
nature with the &s;ingle combats practis'd among&s;t Heroes in their
<PB N="245" REF="238">
mo&s;t &s;olemn games; as is evident from that in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> at the
funeral of <HI>Patroclus.</HI> I could wi&s;h <HI>Homer</HI> had not conde&s;cended
to tho&s;e low je&s;ts and mean railleries towards the conclu&s;ion:
'Tis true, they are not without effect, as they agree with the
characters of the Suitors, and make <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> a &s;pectator of the di&s;|orders
of his own family, and provoke him to a &s;peedy venge|ance:
But might not more &s;erious provocations have been found
out, &s;uch as might become the gravity and maje&s;ty of Epic Poe|try?
or if gayety was e&s;&s;ential to his characters, are quibbles &s;o too?
The&s;e may be thought to be of the &s;ame level with tho&s;e con|ceits
which <HI>Milton</HI> puts into the mouth of the Devil, and which
di&s;grace his Poem. But the dignity, the tenderne&s;s, and ju&s;tne&s;s of
&s;entiments, in all the &s;peeches of <HI>Penelope,</HI> more than attone for
the low railleries of <HI>Eurymachus.</HI></P>

<P>_THE &s;cene &s;till continues in the Palace of <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es;</HI>
but new per&s;ons are introduc'd to
carry on the action, and diver&s;ify the &s;tory;
This book opens with a repetition from the
&s;ixteenth; the Ancients mark'd it with an
A&s;teri&s;m, without any Obelisk, to &s;hew that
it was here in&s;erted with propriety: As we
draw nearer to the conclu&s;ion of the Poem,
the repetitions are more frequent. <HI>Virgil</HI> has generally avoided them,
and indeed it may be ob&s;erv'd, that the&s;e two Poets differ in nothing
more than the manner of their elocution; <HI>Virgil</HI> is full, but <HI>Homer</HI>
even overflows; and this agrees with their general characters. <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
is like tho&s;e Painters of whom <HI>Apelles</HI> u&s;ed to complain, that
they left nothing to be imagined by the &s;pectator, and made too
accurate repre&s;entations; but <HI>Virgil</HI> is like <HI>Timantes</HI> in <HI>Pliny. Ti|manti

<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves, that the unexpected opportunity to remove
the arms in the ab&s;ence of the Suitors, occa&s;ions this repetition;
In the &s;ixteenth book <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> told <HI>Telemachus</HI> he would give a
&s;ign when he &s;hould make the removal, de&s;pairing of an oppor|tunity
to give a public direction, without danger from the Suitors;
he therefore wi&s;ely lays hold of the pre&s;ent hour which happily
favours his de&s;ires, and injoyns the arms to be remov'd imme|diately.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 38. <HI>Minerva&mdash;with her golden lamp</HI>&mdash;] The
office here a&s;crib'd to <HI>Minerva</HI> gave great offence to <HI>Rapin,</HI> and
he cen&s;ur'd it as mean, and unworthy of the Godde&s;s; but <HI>Eu&s;ta|thius</HI>
fully vindicates <HI>Homer; Pallas</HI> is here an allegorical Deity
intended by the Poet to expre&s;s the wi&s;dom of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> he acts
with as much prudence as if <HI>Minerva</HI> her&s;elf guided him in all
his ways. We are to gather from this de&s;cription, that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
form'd all the actions of this night with the utmo&s;t wi&s;dom, or
according to the <HI>Greek</HI> proverb, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the <HI>coun&s;els
of this night</HI> were regulated with the exacte&s;t prudence and &s;ecre&s;y.
<HI>Spondanus</HI> ob&s;erves, that <HI>Callimachus,</HI> a &s;tatuary in <HI>Athens,</HI> made
an image of <HI>Minerva</HI> according to this picture in <HI>Homer:</HI> She
<PB N="293" REF="281">
held a lamp of gold, which was fill'd with an oil of &s;uch an un|wa&s;ting
nature, as not to want to be repleni&s;h'd in the &s;pace of
a whole year. See <HI>lib.</HI> 1. of <HI>Pau&s;anias. Dacier</HI> judges, that tho'
a lamp was unknown in the days of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> yet it might not be
&s;o in the days of <HI>Homer,</HI> and therefore he might &s;peak of it; for
in&s;tance, the trumpet was not known in the <HI>Trojan</HI> war, yet <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
mentions it, becau&s;e it was u&s;ed in his age. But this is no
an&s;wer; for <HI>Homer</HI> does not &s;ay that the trumpet was u&s;ed during
the &s;iege of <HI>Troy;</HI> if he had, he would have been guilty of a gro&s;s
Anachroni&s;m, but he &s;peaks of it by way of allu&s;ion, as a thing
well known in his time. Here therefore the ca&s;e is different, for
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is the per&s;on who is &s;uppos'd to make u&s;e of this lamp,
and <HI>Dacier</HI> allows that it was unknown in his age, and con&s;e|quently
he ought not to u&s;e it at all. It may therefore
perhaps be mo&s;t probable, that <HI>Callimachus</HI> did not form his &s;ta|tue
from this original; or if this be not allow'd, that he fell in|to
an error, and gave the Godde&s;s a lamp in&s;tead of a torch.</P>
<P>I will only further add, that this office of <HI>Minerva</HI> may be
vindicated from all meanne&s;s, by ob&s;erving that it is not the bare
act of carrying the torch which the Godde&s;s here executes; &s;he
improves it into a Miracle; the whole Palace is enlighten'd with a
cele&s;tial fire, and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Telemachus</HI> gather full a&s;&s;urances of
her favour and &s;ucce&s;s from that miraculous illumination: this
circum&s;tance rai&s;es the de&s;cription out of lowne&s;s into dignity.</P>

illuminations, without appearing vi&s;ibly. The latter interpretation
<PB N="294" REF="282">
&s;eems mo&s;t natural, and makes the con&s;truction ea&s;y, whereas the
other is &s;carce to be under&s;tood without &s;upplying <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> before
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t be allow'd, that the former opinion is not
unhappy: <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> tells his &s;on, that the Godde&s;s of ju&s;tice is &s;ent
by the Gods to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in taking vengeance on the Suitors:
<HI>Themis</HI> is a very proper Deity to be introduc'd upon &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion,
and &s;hews that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> proceeded upon the &s;tricte&s;t rules

<P>VERSE 106. <HI>Sweet blooms the Prince beneath</HI> Apollo's <HI>care.</HI>]
It may be ask'd why <HI>Telemachus</HI> is &s;aid to owe the pre&s;ervation
of his life to <HI>Apollo? Eu&s;tathius</HI> an&s;wers, that he was call'd
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> by Antiquity; and that <HI>Daphne</HI> from being his
favourite was nam'd <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: But perhaps that epithet was
appropriated to <HI>Apollo,</HI> becau&s;e all immature deaths in the male
&s;ex were a&s;crib'd to him, as they were to <HI>Diana</HI> in the female;
it may therefore be &s;aid with great propriety that it is owing to
the favour of <HI>Apollo,</HI> that <HI>Telemachus</HI> had not dy'd an immature
death, or that he was arriv'd to manhood: <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> adds, that
<HI>Apollo,</HI> as he is the Sun, may be call'd the nouri&s;her of all things
that breathe, as well as of the inanimate creation; it is owing to
his influence that every being comes to maturity, and in this
&s;en&s;e likewi&s;e he may be call'd <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. What <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI>
a&s;cribes to <HI>Daphne, Dacier</HI> applies to <HI>Diana,</HI> and tells us, that &s;he

after the &s;ame manner; he wears purple, and a buckle or cla&s;p
of gold, as a &s;ign of his regality. But what I would chiefly ob|&s;erve
is, that the art of embroidery was known in the&s;e early
ages, nay perhaps was in greater perfection than at this day;
the embroidery was of divers colours, as we may gather from the
epithet apply'd to the fawn, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Some per&s;ons indeed tell
us, that this was inwoven into the cloth, and was made in
the loom, but the words of <HI>Homer</HI> will admit of the other inter|pretation,
and it is evident that embroidery was known among&s;t
the Orientals in the age of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> from <HI>Judges</HI> v. 20. <HI>Have
they not &s;ped? have they not divided the prey, to Si&s;era a prey of
divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needle-work, of di|vers
colours of needle-work on both &s;ides, meet for the necks of
them that take the &s;poil?</HI> Here is evidently mention made of em|broidery,
and perhaps &s;uch was this robe of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> but how|ever
this be, it is manife&s;t that all manner of creatures were fi|gur'd

remarks, that &s;ome ancient Critics rejected three ver&s;es here:
It is ab&s;urd, &s;ay they, that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;hould chu&s;e <HI>Euryclea</HI> for this
office, who was the only per&s;on who could di&s;cover him, and ruin
his de&s;igns; he knew &s;he was acquainted with the wound that
afterwards di&s;covers him: But the truth is, <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> knew <HI>Eu|ryclea</HI>
to be a per&s;on of wi&s;dom, and he was in hopes to draw
her over to his intere&s;t, and make u&s;e of her in his affairs in
the future parts of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey;</HI> and this he does upon many im|portant
occa&s;ions, in particular in locking up the Palace at the
time of the battle between him and the Suitors; &s;o that by her
means he prevents the report of that great incident from being
<PB N="307" REF="297">
carried to their partizans abroad: here therefore he artfully brings
it about, that <HI>Euryclea</HI> &s;hould be a&s;&s;ign'd to this office, not only
to avoid the in&s;ults of the other females, but to make u&s;e of
her faithfulne&s;s and wi&s;dom to carry on his de&s;igns, and make
the way more ea&s;y to the Suitors' de&s;truction. The choice there|fore
was prudent; &s;he was aged, and acquainted with human
mi&s;eries, not only by rea&s;on of her age, but had her&s;elf &s;uffer'd
in all the afflictions of <HI>Penelope</HI> and <HI>Telemachus:</HI> we find &s;he is
de&s;crib'd as a mother to the whole family, and &s;he all along a|dopts

mi&s;taken when he a&s;&s;erts this to be an in&s;tance of ill coun&s;els

tru&s;t her with the &s;ecret of his return? The rea&s;on is plain,

again in his Poetics, he cites it to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: A Paralogi&s;m
con&s;i&s;ts in making u&s;e of fal&s;e rea&s;oning, and drawing a fal&s;e con|&s;equence
from true premi&s;&s;es: &startq;All men, &s;ays <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> are na|turally
per&s;uaded that where &s;uch a thing is, or is done, &s;uch
another mu&s;t happen, we may therefore make them ea&s;ily be|lieve
that if the la&s;t is, the fir&s;t mu&s;t con&s;equently be; but in
reality, the latter which we lay down as truth being often fal&s;e,
the former is &s;o more frequently, for it does not follow, that
becau&s;e one thing is, another mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, but becau&s;e
we are per&s;uaded of the truth of the latter, we conclude fal&s;ely, that
the former is al&s;o true.&endq; The Reader will enter into the mean|ing
of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and under&s;tand what a Paralogi&s;m is, by an ex|ample
<PB N="308" REF="298">
of it; for in&s;tance, if we were to prove a man to be in
love, we bring it as an argument that he is pale: now this is
a fal&s;e rea&s;oning or Paralogi&s;m, becau&s;e a per&s;on may be pale from
other rea&s;ons than love. Thus in the in&s;tance of <HI>Euryclea,</HI> &startq;<HI>Ho|mer</HI>
(&s;ays <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>) impo&s;es upon his Reader, by mentioning
a &s;ign that is known, to draw a con&s;equence from it, to prove
a thing that is not known;&endq; that is, <HI>Homer</HI> endeavours to prove
that the whole &s;tory concerning <HI>Euryclea</HI> is true, and that &s;he
really hid her eyes when &s;he wept, becau&s;e this is a con&s;equence
of pa&s;&s;ion, and becau&s;e it is natural for per&s;ons to conceal their
eyes with their hands while they weep. This al&s;o is a Paralogi&s;m,
for every &s;yllable concerning <HI>Euryclea</HI> may be a fiction of the
Poet, tho' &s;uch a ge&s;ture is natural to a per&s;on in her circum|&s;tances;
the impo&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts in this, namely, in the art of the
Poet in endeavouring to deceive us into a belief, that becau&s;e
per&s;ons when they weep conceal their eyes, therefore it is true
that <HI>Euryclea</HI> thus actually wept; the latter may be evidently, tho'

<P><Q><L>VERSE 457. Autolycus the bold: (a mighty name</L>
<L>For &s;potle&s;s faith&mdash;]</L></Q>
This difficult pa&s;&s;age is well explain'd by <HI>Dacier</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;tathius:</HI>

<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>&mdash;</Q>
which literally run thus, &startq;he &s;urpa&s;s'd all men in &s;wearing and
&s;tealing:&endq; a terrible character if it were to be under&s;tood
according to the letter: It has been imagin'd, that <HI>Homer</HI> com|mends
<HI>Autolycus</HI> for his addre&s;s in robbery, and making equivo|cal
oaths; like the per&s;on (&s;ays <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI>) who made a truce
with his enemies for &s;everal days, and immediately went and ra|vag'd
their territories by night, and defended it, by telling them
that the truce was not made for the night but the day: or like
the per&s;on mention'd by <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> who &s;tole a fi&s;h, and gave it
to his neighbour, and being que&s;tion'd about it &s;wore, that he
had it not him&s;elf, nor &s;aw any other per&s;on &s;teal it: but this is
not the meaning of <HI>Homer,</HI> for he calls <HI>Autolycus</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or a
<HI>good man,</HI> and adds that this <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, was the gift
of a God. The truth is, the former word does not here &s;ignifie theft,
nor the latter perjury: the former &s;ignifies a laudable addre&s;s in
concealing our own de&s;igns, and di&s;covering tho&s;e of our ene|mies;
it con&s;i&s;ts in &s;urprizing them, when they lea&s;t expect us,
in beating up their quarters, carrying off their convoys, their
provi&s;ions, and in &s;hort in all manner of &s;tratagems, authoriz'd
by the laws of war: <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;ignifies fidelity in ob&s;erving an
oath, and never violating the &s;anctity of it. <HI>Plato</HI> in his fir&s;t book
<HI>de Repub.</HI> makes it plain, that this is the &s;en&s;e of <HI>Homer:</HI> He
there quotes this pa&s;&s;age, and a&s;&s;erts that he is the be&s;t guardian
of an army who knows how to &s;teal the coun&s;els and enterpri|&s;es
of the enemy, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">;
<PB N="313" REF="303">
from this, it is there inferr'd, that ju&s;tice is a
kind of chicanery (<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">)
by which we &s;erve our friends, and bring detriment to
our enemies; but the an&s;wer there given to this a&s;&s;ertion is, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
or, by no means: It mu&s;t be under&s;tood with &s;ome re|&s;triction:
It is lawful to deceive an enemy in war, but in com|mon
life criminal. The qualities therefore that <HI>Homer</HI> commends
in <HI>Autolycus,</HI> are his dexterity in di&s;covering, penetrating and
preventing the de&s;igns of his enemies, and the religious ob&s;er|vance
of his oaths, and not theft and perjury; <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> explains

This is a remarkable in&s;tance of the antiquity of that idle &s;uper&s;ti|tion
of curing wounds by incantation or charms: yet <HI>Homer</HI> is
no way blameable for mentioning it; he wrote according to the
opinion of the age, which whether true or fal&s;e vindicates him
as a Poet. Indeed almo&s;t all other Poets have &s;poken more bold|ly
than <HI>Homer</HI> of the power of incantations; thus <HI>Virgil,</HI>

But we may defend <HI>Homer</HI> from <HI>Pliny,</HI> who has thought this
point, <HI>viz.</HI> whether charms are available phy&s;ically, worthy of a
&s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; he refers to this pa&s;&s;age in his natural Hi&s;tory,
<HI>lib.</HI> 28. <HI>cap.</HI> 1. <HI>Dixit Homerus profluvium &s;anguinis vulnerato fe|mine
Ulyxem inhibui&s;&s;e carmine, Theophra&s;tus, I&s;chiadicos &s;anari, Cato
prodidit Luxatis membris carmen auxiliary, Varro Podagris. Attalus</HI>
affirms, that if a man chance to &s;py a &s;corpion, and pronounce
the word <HI>duo,</HI> it will lie &s;till, and never &s;hoot his &s;ting. I think
<PB N="315" REF="305">
the&s;e grave Authors outdo even the fictions of Poets; and I hard|ly
believe that any of them would have ventur'd to provoke a
&s;erpent, tru&s;ting to the charm. But we are to under&s;tand this
charm not merely as a form of words, but as joyn'd with mu&s;ical
notes, and then it may appear more rational: for the cure of
the Sciatica, <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> commends the <HI>Phrygian</HI> mu&s;ic, and <HI>A.
Gellius</HI> for giving ea&s;e to it; but adds, <HI>ut Memoriae proditum e&s;t.
Apollonius</HI> in his book <HI>de Miris,</HI> affirms from <HI>Theophra&s;tus,</HI> that
Mu&s;ic cures many di&s;ea&s;es both of mind and body, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
And the
&s;ame Author affirms, that many in his time, e&s;pecially the <HI>The|bans,</HI>
u&s;ed the pipe for the cure of &s;everal &s;ickne&s;&s;es, which <HI>Galen</HI>
calls <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>&s;uper loco affecto tibi&acirc; canere;</HI> or <HI>loca
dolentia decantare.</HI> I will not affirm that &s;uch charms of mu&s;ic
have no power in &s;ome maladies; every one knows what an ef|fect
the harp of <HI>David</HI> had over the &s;pirits of <HI>Saul;</HI> but we have
either lo&s;t, or not yet found out the art: A natural rea&s;on may
be a&s;&s;ign'd for it, for as the mu&s;ical notes move the air, &s;o the
air moves the inward &s;pirits, and they the humours of the body,
which are the &s;eat of di&s;ea&s;es; &s;o that by this new motion they
may be conden&s;ed, ratified, di&s;&s;ipated or expelled, according as
they are agitated or influenced by the concu&s;&s;ion of the mu&s;ical
notes; but however this be, if other Poets may &s;ay that charms
have power to &s;top rivers in their cour&s;es, <HI>Homer</HI> is not to be
condemn'd for a&s;cribing the power of &s;topping blood to incan|tations.

unle&s;s that name be the &s;ame with <HI>Pandareus; Itylus</HI> like|wi&s;e

&s;he had a &s;i&s;ter nam'd <HI>Progne,</HI> whom <HI>Tereus</HI> ravi&s;h'd and cut her

<P>VERSE 647. <HI>Immur'd within the &s;ilent bow'r of &s;leep,</HI> &amp;c.]
This &s;eems to be a bold fiction, and Commentators have labour'd
hard to &s;hew the rea&s;on of it: Some imagine, that by the horn
is meant a tunic of the eye, which is call'd horny; and that the
ivory repre&s;ents the teeth; and that by the&s;e allu&s;ions the Poet in|tended
to expre&s;s that what we hear &s;poken may be fal&s;e, but
what we &s;ee mu&s;t infallibly be true: that is, according to this
fable, the ivory gate emits fal&s;hood, that of horn, truth. Others
explain <HI>Homer</HI> by referring to the nature of horn and ivory, horn be|ing
pervious to the &s;ight, and ivory impenetrable. <HI>Dacier,</HI> from
<HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> gives us a very different &s;olution; by horn which is
tran&s;parent, <HI>Homer</HI> means the air, or heavens which are tran&s;lu|cent;
by ivory, he denotes the earth which is gro&s;s and opake:
Thus the dreams which come from the earth, that is, thro' the
gate of ivory, are fal&s;e; tho&s;e from heaven, or thro' the gate of
horn, true. But it may be thought that there are no grounds,
from the words of <HI>Homer,</HI> for &s;uch an interpretation. I ima|gine
that this fable is built upon a real foundation, and that there
were places called the gates of fal&s;hood and truth: <HI>Diodorus Sicu|lus</HI>
in his &s;econd book de&s;cribing the ceremonies concerning the
<PB N="319" REF="309">
dead, mentions the gates of oblivion, of hatred and lamentati|on;
and then adds, that there are other gates in the &s;ame place;
namely, in <HI>Memphis</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> that are called the gates of veri|ty,
near which there is a &s;tatue of ju&s;tice without an head; now
<HI>Homer</HI> in the twenty-fourth <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> places the region of dreams
in the way to the infernal &s;hades, and it is pa&s;t di&s;pute that he bor|rows
all the&s;e fables of <HI>Styx, Cocytus,</HI> (that is, of the gates of
hatred, lamentation,) <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and places them in hell,
after <HI>Orpheus,</HI> who adapted all his ceremonies according to the
rites of burial ob&s;erv'd at <HI>Memphis,</HI> as <HI>Diodorus</HI> fully proves; if
therefore he borrows the fable of the gates of oblivion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from
<HI>Aegypt,</HI> why may he not the &s;tory of the gates of fal&s;hood and veri|ty?
e&s;pecially &s;ince he takes his whole relation concerning hell from
the cu&s;toms of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and this region of dreams is pla|ced
by him in the pa&s;&s;age to hell: It may therefore not be im|po&s;&s;ible
but this &s;tory of the gates of &s;leep, may have a real
foundation, and be built upon the cu&s;toms of the <HI>Aegyptians.</HI></P>
