<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A Great part of the poetical works of Mr.
SHENSTONE, particularly his Elegies and
Pa&s;torals, are (as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it) &startq; The
exact tran&s;cripts of the &s;ituation of his own
mind;&endq; and abound in frequent allu&s;ions to his
own place, the beautiful &s;cene of his retirement
from the world. Exclu&s;ively therefore of our
natural curio&s;ity to be acquainted with the
hi&s;tory of an author, who&s;e works we peru&s;e with
plea&s;ure, &s;ome &s;hort account of Mr. SHENSTONE'S
per&s;onal character, and &s;ituation in life, may not
only be agreeable, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to
the reader; as it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould enter
into the true &s;pirit of his writings, if he is en|tirely
ignorant of tho&s;e circum&s;tances of his life,
which &s;ometimes &s;o greatly influenced his re|flections.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h however that this ta&s;k had been
allotted to &s;ome per&s;on capable of performing it
in that ma&s;terly manner which the &s;ubject &s;o
<PB N="ii" REF="5">
well de&s;erves. To confe&s;s the truth, it was
chiefly to prevent his remains from falling into
the hands of any one &s;till le&s;s qualified to do
him ju&s;tice, that I have unwillingly ventured to
undertake the publication of them my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. SHENSTONE was the elde&s;t &s;on of a
plain uneducated country gentleman in SHROP|SHIRE,
who farmed his own e&s;tate. The father,
&s;en&s;ible of his &s;on's extraordinary capacity, re|&s;olved
to give him a learned education, and
&s;ent him a commoner to PEMBROKE College
in OXFORD, de&s;igning him for the church: but
tho' he had the mo&s;t aweful notions of the
wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s of God, he never
could be per&s;uaded to enter into orders. In
his private opinions he adhered to no particular
&s;ect, and hated all religious di&s;putes. But
whatever were his own &s;entiments, he always
&s;hewed great tenderne&s;s to tho&s;e, who differed
from him, Tenderne&s;s, indeed, in every &s;en&s;e
of the word, was his peculiar characteri&s;tic;
his friends, his dome&s;tics, his poor neighbours,
all daily experienced his benevolent turn of mind.
Indeed, this virtue in him was often carried to
&s;uch exce&s;s, that it &s;ometimes bordered upon
<PB N="iii" REF="6">
weakne&s;s: yet if he was convinced that any of
tho&s;e ranked among&s;t the number of his friends,
had treated him ungenerou&s;ly, he was not ea&s;ily
reconciled. He u&s;ed a maxim, however, on &s;uch
occa&s;ions, which is worthy of being ob&s;erved
and imitated; &startq;I never (&s;aid he) will be a
revengeful enemy; but I cannot, it is not in my
nature, to be half a friend.&endq; He was in his
temper quite un&s;u&s;picious; but if &s;u&s;picion was
once awakened in him, it was not laid a&s;leep
again without difficulty.</P>
<P>He was no oeconomi&s;t; the genero&s;ity of his
temper prevented him from paying a proper
regard to the u&s;e of money: he exceeded there|fore
the bounds of his paternal fortune, which
before he died was con&s;iderably encumbered. But
when one recollects the perfect paradi&s;e he had
rai&s;ed around him, the ho&s;pitality, with which
he lived, his great indulgence to his &s;ervants,
his charities to the indigent, and all done with
an e&s;tate not more than three hundred pounds
a year, one &s;hould rather be led to wonder that
he le&s;t any thing behind him, than to blame
his want of oeconomy. He left however more,
than &s;ufficient to pay all his debts; and by his
<PB N="iv" REF="7">
will appropriated his whole e&s;tate for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>It was perhaps from &s;ome con&s;iderations on
the narrowne&s;s of his fortune, that he forbore
to marry; for he was no enemy to wedlock,
had a high opinion of many among the fair &s;ex,
was fond of their &s;ociety, and no &s;tranger to the
tendere&s;t impre&s;&s;ions. One, which he received
in his youth, was with difficulty &s;urmounted.
The lady was the &s;ubject of that &s;weet pa&s;toral,
in four parts, which has been &s;o univer&s;ally
admired; and which, one would have thought,
mu&s;t have &s;ubdued the loftie&s;t heart, and &s;of|tened
the mo&s;t obdurate.</P>
<P>His per&s;on, as to height, was above the
middle &s;tature, but largely and rather inelegant|ly
formed: his face &s;eemed plain till you con|ver&s;ed
with him, and then it grew very plea&s;ing.
In his dre&s;s he was negligent, even to a fault;
though when young, at the univer&s;ity, he was
accounted a BEAU. He wore his own hair,
which was quite grey very early, in a par|ticular
manner; not from any affectation of &s;in|gularity,
but from a maxim he had laid down, that
<PB N="v" REF="8">
without too &s;lavi&s;h a regard to fa&s;hion, every
one &s;hould dre&s;s in a manner mo&s;t &s;uitable to his
own per&s;on and figure. In &s;hort, his faults
were only little blemi&s;hes, thrown in by nature,
as it were on purpo&s;e to prevent him from ri&s;ing
too much above that level of imperfection al|lotted
to humanity.</P>
<P>His character as a writer will be di&s;tingui&s;hed
by &s;implicity with elegance, and genius with
correctne&s;s. He had a &s;ublimity equal to the
highe&s;t attempts; yet from the indolence of his
temper, he cho&s;e rather to amu&s;e him&s;elf in
culling flowers at the foot of the mount, than to
take the trouble of climbing the more arduous
&s;teeps of PARNASSUS. But whenever he was di&s;|po&s;ed
to ri&s;e, his &s;teps, tho' natural, were noble,
and always well &s;upported. In the tenderne&s;s
of elegiac poetry he hath not been excelled; in
the &s;implicity of pa&s;toral, one may venture to &s;ay
he had very few equals. Of great &s;en&s;ibility
him&s;elf, he never failed to engage the hearts
of his readers: and amid&s;t the nice&s;t attention
to the harmony of his numbers, he always took
care to expre&s;s with propriety the &s;entiments
of an elegant mind. In all his writings, his
<PB N="vi" REF="9">
greate&s;t difficulty was to plea&s;e him&s;elf. I re|member
a pa&s;&s;age in one of his letters, where,
&s;peaking of his love longs, he &s;ays&mdash;&startq;Some
were written on occa&s;ions a good deal ima|ginary,
others not &s;o; and the rea&s;on there
are &s;o many is, that I wanted to write ONE
good &s;ong, and could never plea&s;e my&s;elf.&endq;
It was this diffidence which occa&s;ioned him to
throw a&s;ide many of his pieces before he had
be&s;towed upon them his la&s;t touches. I have
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;everal on this account; and if among
tho&s;e which I have &s;elected, there &s;hould be
di&s;covered &s;ome little want of his fini&s;hing
poli&s;h, I hope it will be attributed to this cau&s;e,
and of cour&s;e be excu&s;ed: yet I flatter my&s;elf
there will always appear &s;omething well worthy
of having been pre&s;erved. And though I was
afraid of in&s;erting what might injure the cha|racter
of my friend, yet as the &s;ketches of a
great ma&s;ter are always valuable, I was un|willing
the public &s;hould lo&s;e any thing material
of &s;o accompli&s;hed a writer. In this dilemma
it will ea&s;ily be conceived that the ta&s;k I had to
perform would become &s;omewhat difficult. How
I have acquitted my&s;elf, the public mu&s;t judge.
Nothing, however, except what he had al|ready
<PB N="vii" REF="10">
publi&s;hed, has been admitted without the
advice of his mo&s;t judicious friends, nothing
altered, without their particular concurrence.
It is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e every one; but 'tis
hoped that no reader will be &s;o unrea&s;onable, as
to imagine that the author wrote &s;olely for his
amu&s;ement: his talents were various; and
though it may perhaps be allowed that his ex|cellence
chiefly appeared in &s;ubjects of tenderne&s;s
and &s;implicity, yet he frequently conde&s;cended
to trifle with tho&s;e of humour and drollery:
the&s;e, indeed, he him&s;elf in &s;ome mea&s;ure de|graded
by the title which he gave them of LE|VITIES:
but had they been entirely rejected,
the public would have been deprived of &s;ome
JEUX D'ESPRITS, excellent in their kind, and
Mr. SHENSTONE'S character as a writer would
have been but imperfectly exhibited.</P>
<P>But the talents of Mr. SHENSTONE were not
confined merely to poetry; his character, as a
man of clear judgment, and deep penetration,
will be&s;t appear from his pro&s;e works. It is
there we mu&s;t &s;earch for the acutene&s;s of his
under&s;tanding, and his profound knowledge of
the human heart. It is to be lamented indeed,
<PB N="viii" REF="11">
that &s;ome things here are unfinished, and can
be regarded only as fragments: many are left as
&s;ingle thoughts, but which, like the &s;parks. of
diamonds, &s;hew the richne&s;s of the mine to
which they belong; or like the foot of a HER|CULES,
di&s;cover the uncommon &s;trength, and
extraordinary dimen&s;hions of that hero. I have
no apprehen&s;ion of incurring blame from any
one, for pre&s;erving the&s;e valuable remains: they
will di&s;cover to every reader, the author's &s;en|timents
on &s;everal important &s;ubjects. And
there can be very few, to whom they will not
impart many thoughts, which they would never
perhaps have been able to draw from the
&s;ource of their own reflections.</P>
<P>But I believe little need be &s;aid to recommend
the writings of this gentleman to public atten|tion.
His character is already &s;urfficiently e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.
And if he be not injured by the in|ability
of his editor, there is no doubt but he
will ever maintain an eminent &s;tation among
the be&s;t of our Engli&s;h writers.</P>

<HEAD>A
PREFATORY ESSAY
ON
ELEGY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, that di&s;cour&s;es <HI>prefixed</HI> to
poetry are contrived very frequently to inculcate
&s;uch tenets as may exhibit the performance to the
greate&s;t advantage. The fabric is very commonly
rai&s;ed in the <HI>fir&s;t place,</HI> and the mea&s;ures, by which we
are to judge of its merits are afterwards adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>There have been few rules given us by the critics
concerning the &s;tructure of <HI>elegiac</HI> poetry; and far
<PB N="4" REF="14">
be it from the author of the following trifles, to dig|ni&s;y
his own <HI>opinions</HI> with that <HI>denomination.</HI> He
would only intimate the great variety of <HI>&s;ubjects,</HI> and
the different<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This e&s;&s;ay was written near twenty years ago.</NOTE> <HI>&s;tyles</HI> in which the writers of elegy
<HI>have</HI> hitherto indulged them&s;elves, and endeavour to
&s;hield the following ones by the latitude of <HI>their</HI> ex|ample.</P>
<P>If we con&s;idcr the etymology of the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, $particulam dolendi.</NOTE> <HI>word,</HI> the
epithet which<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;erabiles elegos. HOR.</NOTE> <HI>HORACE</HI> gives it, or the confe&s;&s;ion
which<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Heu nimis ex <HI>vero</HI> nunc tibi nomen erit.</NOTE> <HI>OVID</HI> makes concerning it, I think we may
<HI>conclude</HI> thus much however; that <HI>elegy,</HI> in its true
and genuine acceptation, <HI>includes</HI> a tender and que|rulous
idea: that it looks upon <HI>this</HI> as its peculiar
characteri&s;tic, and &s;o long as <HI>this</HI> is thoroughly &s;u&s;|tained,
admits of a variety of &s;ubjects; which by its
manner of treating them, it renders its own. It
throws its melancholy <HI>&s;tole</HI> over pretty different ob|jects,
which, like the dre&s;&s;es at a funeral proce&s;&s;ion,
gives them all a kind of &s;olemn and uniform appear|ance.</P>
<P>It is probable that elegies were written at <HI>fir&s;t</HI> up|on
the death of <HI>intimate friends</HI> and <HI>near relations;
<PB N="5" REF="15">
celebrated beauties,</HI> or <HI>favourite mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; bene|ficent
governors</HI> and <HI>illu&s;trious men:</HI> one may add
perhaps, of all tho&s;e, who are placed by <HI>VIRGIL</HI> in
the laurel-grove of his Ely&s;ium, (Vide <HI>HURD</HI>'s
Di&s;&s;ertation on <HI>HORACE</HI>'s Epi&s;tle)
<Q>Quique &s;ui memores alios fecere merendo.</Q>
After the&s;e &s;ubjects were &s;ufficiently exhau&s;ted, and
the &s;everity of fate di&s;played in the mo&s;t affecting in|&s;tances,
the poets &s;ought occa&s;ion to vary their com|plaints;
and the next tender &s;pecies of &s;orrow that
pre&s;ented it&s;elf, was the grief of <HI>ab&s;ent</HI> or <HI>neglected</HI>
lovers. And this indulgence might be indeed allowed
them; but with <HI>this</HI> they were not contented. They
had obtained a &s;mall corner in the province of love,
and they took advantage, from thence, to over-run
the whole territory. They &s;ung its &s;poils, triumphs,
evations, and rejoicings<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dicite Io Paean, &amp; Io bis dicite Paean. OVID.</NOTE>, as well as the captivity and
exequies that attended it. They gave the name of <HI>elegy</HI>
to their plea&s;antries as well as lamentations; 'till at
la&s;t, through their abundant fondne&s;s for the <HI>myrtle,</HI>
they forgot that the <HI>cypre&s;s</HI> was <HI>their</HI> peculiar garland.</P>
<P>In this it is probable they deviated from the original
de&s;ign of elegy; and it &s;hould &s;eem, that any kind of
&s;ubjects, treated in &s;uch a manner as to diffu&s;e a plea&s;ing
<PB N="6" REF="16">
melancholy, might far better de&s;erve <HI>the name,</HI> than
the facetious mirth and libertine fe&s;tivity of the &s;uc|ce&s;sful
votaries of love.</P>
<P>But not to dwell too long upon art opinion which may
<HI>&s;eem</HI> perhaps introduced to favour the following per|formance,
it may not be improper to examine into the
<HI>u&s;e</HI> and <HI>end</HI> of elegy. The mo&s;t important end of <HI>all</HI>
poetry is to encourage virtue. <HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>tragedy</HI>
chiefly recommend the <HI>public</HI> virtues; <HI>elegy</HI> is of a
&s;pecies which illu&s;trates and endears the <HI>private.</HI>
There is a truly virtuous plea&s;ure connected with many
pen&s;ive contemplations, which it is the province and
excellency of elegy to enforce. This, by pre&s;enting
&s;uitable ideas, has di&s;covered &s;weets in <HI>melancholy</HI>
which we could not find in <HI>mirth;</HI> and has led us
with &s;ucce&s;s to the du&s;ty <HI>urn,</HI> when we could draw
no plea&s;ure from the &s;parkling bowl; as pa&s;toral
conveys an idea of &s;implicity and innocence, it
is in particular the ta&s;k and merit of elegy to &s;hew
the innocence and &s;implicity of rural life to ad|vantage;
and that, in a way di&s;tinct from <HI>pa&s;toral,</HI>
as much as the plain but judicious landlord may be
imagined to &s;urpa&s;s his tenant both in <HI>dignity</HI> and
<HI>under&s;tanding.</HI> It &s;hould al&s;o tend to elevate the
more tranquil virtues of <HI>humility, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s,
&s;implicity,</HI> and <HI>innocence:</HI> but then there is a <HI>de|gree</HI>
of elegance and refinement, no way incon&s;i&s;tent
with the&s;e <HI>rural</HI> virtues; and that rai&s;es <HI>elegy</HI> above
<PB N="7" REF="17">
that <HI>merum rus,</HI> that <HI>unpoli&s;hed</HI> ru&s;ticity, which
has given our <HI>pa&s;toral</HI> writers their highe&s;t reputation.</P>
<P>Wealth and &s;plendor will never want their proper
weight: the danger is, left they &s;hould too much pre|ponderate.
A kind of poetry therefore which throws
its chief influence into the other &s;cale, that magnifies
the &s;weets of liberty and independence, that <HI>endears</HI>
the hone&s;t <HI>delights</HI> of love and friend&s;hip, that <HI>cele|brates</HI>
the <HI>glory</HI> of a good name after death, that ridi|cules
the futile arrogance of birth, that recommends
the innocent amu&s;ement of letters, and in&s;en&s;ibly pre|pares
the mind for that humanity it <HI>inculcates, &s;uch</HI>
a kind of poetry may chance to plea&s;e; and if it
plea&s;e, &s;hould &s;eem to be of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>&s;tyle</HI> of elegy, it may be it well enough de|termined
from what has gone before. It &s;hould imi|tate
the voice and language of grief; or if a meta|phor
of dre&s;s? be more agreeable, it &s;hould be &s;imple
and diffu&s;e, and flowing as a mourner's veil. A ver|&s;ification
therefore is de&s;ireable, which, by indulging
a free and uncon&s;trained expre&s;&s;ion, may admit of that
&s;implicity which elegy requires.</P>
<P>Heroic metre, with alternate rhime, &s;eems well
enough adapted to this &s;pecies of poetry; and, how|ever
exceptionable upon other occa&s;ions, its inconve|niences
appear to lo&s;e their weight <HI>in &s;horter</HI> elegies;
<PB N="8" REF="18">
and its advantages &s;eem to <HI>acquire</HI> an <HI>additional</HI> im|portance.
The world has an admirable example of its
beauty in a collection of elegies<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">N. E. This preface was written near twenty years ago.</NOTE> <HI>not long</HI> &s;ince <HI>pub|li&s;hed;</HI>
the product of a gentleman of the mo&s;t exact
ta&s;te, and who&s;e untimely death merits all the tears
that elegy can &s;hed.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible that &s;ome may think this metre
too lax and pro&s;aic: others, that even a more di&s;&s;olute
variety of numbers may have &s;uperior advantages.
And, in favour of the&s;e la&s;t, might be produced the
example of <HI>MILTON</HI> in his <HI>LYCIDAS,</HI> together with
one or two recent and beautiful imitations of his ver|&s;ification
in that monody. But this kind of argument,
I am apt to think, mu&s;t prove <HI>too much;</HI> &s;ince the
writers I have in view &s;eem capable enough of recom|mending
any metre they &s;hall chu&s;e; though it mu&s;t be
awned al&s;o, that the choice <HI>they</HI> make of any, is at
the &s;ame time the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption in its favour.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be no great difficulty to <HI>compromi&s;e</HI>
the di&s;pute. There is no one kind of metre that is
di&s;tingui&s;hed by rhimes, but is liable to &s;ome objection or
other, Heroic ver&s;e, where every &s;econd line is ter|minated
by a rhime, (with which the judgment re|quires
that the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> &s;hould in &s;ome mea&s;ure al&s;o termi|nate)
is apt to render the expre&s;&s;ion either &s;canty or
<PB N="9" REF="19">
con&s;trained. And this is &s;ometimes ob&s;ervable in the
writings of a poet lately decea&s;ed; though I believe no
one ever threw &s;o much &s;en&s;e together with &s;o much
<HI>ea&s;e</HI> into a couplet as Mr. <HI>POPE.</HI> But as an air of
<HI>con&s;traint</HI> too often accompanies this metre, it &s;eems
by no means proper for a writer of <HI>elegy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>previous</HI> rhime in <HI>MILTON'S LYCIDAS</HI> is very
frequently placed at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the follow|ing,
that it is often dropt by the memory (much better
employed in attending to the &s;entiment) before it be
brought to join its partner: and this &s;eems to be the
greate&s;t objection to <HI>that</HI> kind of versification. But
then the peculiar <HI>ea&s;e</HI> and <HI>variety</HI> it admits of, are no
doubt &s;ufficient to overbalance the objection, and to
give it the preference to any other, in an elegy of
<HI>length.</HI></P>
<P>The chief exception to which <HI>&s;tanza</HI> of all kinds is
liable, is, that it breaks the &s;en&s;e too <HI>regularly,</HI>
when it is continued through a long poem. And this
may be perhaps the fault of Mr. <HI>WALLER's</HI> excellent
panegyric. But if this fault be le&s;s di&s;cernible in
&s;maller compo&s;itions, as I &s;uppo&s;e it <HI>is,</HI> I flatter my|&s;elf,
that the advantages I have before mentioned re|&s;ulting
from alternate rhime (with which &s;tanza is,
I think, connected) may; at lea&s;t in <HI>&s;horter</HI> elegies,
be allowed to out-weigh its imperfections.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="20">
I &s;hall &s;ay but little of the different <HI>kinds</HI> of elegy.
The melancholy of a lover is different, no doubt, from
what we feel on other mixed occa&s;ions. The mind in
which love and grief at once predominate, is &s;oftened
to an <HI>exce&s;s.</HI> Love-elegy therefore is more negligent
of order and de&s;ign, and, being addre&s;&s;ed chiefly to the
ladies, requires little more than tenderne&s;s and per&s;pi|cuity.
Elegies, that are formed upon promi&s;cuous in|cidents,
and addre&s;&s;ed to the world in general, incul|cate
&s;ome &s;ort of moral, and admit a different degree
of rea&s;oning, thought, and order.</P>
<P>The author of the following elegies entered on his
&s;ubjects <HI>occa&s;ionally,</HI> as particular incidents in life
<HI>&s;ugge&s;ted,</HI> or di&s;po&s;itions of mind <HI>recommended</HI>
them to his choice. If he de&s;cribes a rural land&s;kip,
or unfolds the train of &s;entiments it in&s;pired, he fairly
drew his picture from the &s;pot; and felt very &s;en&s;ibly
the affection he communicates. If he &s;peaks of his
humble &s;hed, his flocks and his fleeces, he does not coun|terfeit
the &s;cene; who having (whether through choice
or nece&s;&s;ity, is not material) retired betimes to country|&s;olitudes,
and &s;ought his happine&s;s in rural employments,
has a right to con&s;ider him&s;elf as a real &s;hepherd.
The flocks, the meadows, and the grottos, are <HI>his own,</HI>
and the embelli&s;hment of his <HI>farm</HI> his &s;ole amu&s;ement.
As the &s;entiments therefore were in&s;pired by nature,
and that in the earlier part of his life, he hopes they
will retain a natural appearance; diffu&s;ing at lea&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="21">
&s;ome <HI>part</HI> of that amu&s;ement, which he freely acknow|ledges
he received from the compo&s;ition of them.</P>
<P>There will appear perhaps a real incon&s;i&s;tency in
the moral tenour of the &s;everal elegies; and the &s;ub|&s;equent
ones may &s;ometimes &s;eem a recantation of the
preceding. The reader will &s;carcely impute this to
over&s;ight; but will allow, that men's opinions as well
as tempers vary; that neither public nor private,
active nor &s;peculative life, are unexceptionably happy,
and con&s;equently that any change of opinion concern|ing
them may afford an additional beauty to poetry,
as it gives us a more &s;triking repre&s;entation of life.</P>
<P>If the author has hazarded, throughout, the u&s;e of
Engli&s;h or modern allu&s;ions, he hopes it will not be
imputed to an <HI>entire</HI> ignorance, or to the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> di&s;e&s;teem
of the ancient learning. He has kept the ancient
<HI>plan</HI> and <HI>method</HI> in his eye, though he builds
his edifice with the materials of his own nation.
In other words, through a fondne&s;s for his native
country, he has made u&s;e of the flowers it produced,
though, in order to exhibit them to the greater ad|vantage,
he has endeavoured to weave his garland by
the be&s;t model he could find: with what &s;ucce&s;s, be|yond
his own amu&s;ement, mu&s;t be left to judges le&s;s
partial to him than either his acquaintance or his
friends.&mdash;If any of tho&s;e &s;hould be &s;o candid, as to
approve the variety of &s;ubjects he has cho&s;en, and the
<PB N="12" REF="22">
tenderne&s;s of &s;entiment he has endeavoured to impre&s;s,
he begs the <HI>metre</HI> al&s;o may not be too &s;uddenly con|demned.
The public ear, habituated of late to a
quicker mea&s;ure, may perhaps con&s;ider <HI>this</HI> as heavy
and languid; but an objection of that kind may gra|dually
lo&s;e its force, if this mea&s;ure &s;hould be allowed
to &s;uit the nature of elegy.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould happen to be con&s;idered as an objection
with <HI>others,</HI> that there is too much of a moral ca&s;t
diffu&s;ed through the whole; it is replied, that, he <HI>en|deavoured</HI>
to animate the poetry &s;o far as not to ren|der
this objection too obvious; or to <HI>ri&s;que excluding</HI>
the fa&s;hionable reader: at the &s;ame time never de|viating
from a fixed principle, that poetry without
morality is but the <HI>blo&s;&s;om</HI> of a <HI>fruit-tree.</HI> Poetry
is indeed like that &s;pecies of plants, which may bear
at once both fruits and blo&s;&s;oms, and the tree is by no
means in perfection without the <HI>former,</HI> however it
may be embelli&s;hed by the flowers which &s;urround it.</P>
