<P>JOY! I give you joy, Sir!&mdash;Once more welcome to Mandeville Ca&s;tle!&mdash;Look, Sir!&mdash;there &s;tands the old pile, ju&s;t as we left it fourteen years ago! Shall I knock at the gate?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lo&s;e not a moment. <STAGE><HI>[Rob knocks.]</HI></STAGE> I have travel|led far to have the my&s;tery unravelled; and till I know why I have been thus treated&mdash;why for three tedious years I have received no letter from my father&mdash;no tidings of my child&mdash;the interval is in&s;upportable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pretty treatment, indeed, Sir!&mdash;to bring two gen|tlemen from India&mdash;all the way from the &s;hores of Bengal to the coa&s;t of Devon&s;hire&mdash;only to get an an&s;wer to our let|ters!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Didn't I write by every packet?&mdash;regularly remit half my pay for the &s;upport of my daughter?&mdash;And to re|ceive no an&s;wer!&mdash;to hear nothing from my father, or Mrs. Rigid, the governe&s;s of my child?&mdash;What&mdash;what can be the motive for this &s;ilence?&mdash;In India I have been guilty of no vices&mdash;no extravagance!&mdash;and if, before I
<PB N="6" REF="6">went, I involved my&s;elf in pecuniary embarra&s;&s;ments, was it not to &s;erve a friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It was, Sir!&mdash;You became &s;ecurity for the ungrate|ful Mr. Howard; and becau&s;e he took it into his head to die, and leave you re&s;pon&s;ible for twenty thou&s;and pounds&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We were compelled to fly to India!&mdash;Well, well, blame not Howard; if he had lived, he would have pro|ved him&s;elf de&s;erving of my friend&s;hip. But now, Robert, I am here once more in the centre of my creditors; and if my father has forgotten me&mdash;Knock again&mdash;the &s;u&s;pen&s;e is dreadful!</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Rob. [knocks]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Surely they are all run away, or drowned, or hanged&mdash;Hanged!&mdash;I beg pardon, Sir!&mdash;I only al|lude to the female part of the family; and I dare &s;ay ma|ny a fair neck has been twi&s;ted in con&s;equence of my ab|&s;ence&mdash;Not come yet!

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can't you remember our &s;tealing out of tho&s;e gates in di&s;gui&s;e?&mdash;our being found out by the bailiffs, and dodging them &s;o artfully from place to place, that by the time they had taken out a writ in one county we were &s;afely perched in another; till at la&s;t, after having outwit|ted half the &s;heriffs'-officers and attorneys in England, we &s;$$ured our retreat by arriving at Port&s;mouth late on a Sa|turday night, and &s;ailing for India early on Sunday morn|ing!&mdash;Ha! ha! ha! I &s;hall never forget the Captain's &s;moking us, and after dinner giving for a toa&s;t, "Succe&s;s to the Sunday men!"</P>

<P>Don't talk to me, you old poacher! Hav'n't you been repeatedly warned off Sir Solomon's manor, and didn't he him&s;elf &s;ee you kill the hare on his ground? And therefore, at Sir Solomon's reque&s;t, I di&s;mi&s;s you from being game keeper to the Mandeville manors.</P>

<P>Di&s;inherited!</P>
</SP>

<P>Cut off with a &s;hilling!&mdash;Mr. Mandeville has left his whole e&s;tate to a woman.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A woman!&mdash;Oh! the old profligate!</P>

<P>To your child, Sir <STAGE><HI>[to Mandeville]</HI></STAGE>&mdash;to his own grand daughter!</P>

<P>To Albina!</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo!&mdash;Then it comes to the &s;ame point! my ma&s;|ter of cour&s;e manages the property, and I'm &s;teward &s;till.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There you're out again! I rather think Mrs. Rigid will manage the property. I rather imagine the young Heire&s;s will be ruled by the old Governe&s;s; and as you've been no friend to her, Mr. Mandeville&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No friend to her!&mdash;How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay: perhaps you may call it friend&s;hip to leave her to &s;upport your daughter at her own expence; perhaps you may call it friend&s;hip, not to write any letters, or re|mit any money, for three years together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Go on, Sir; let me know all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you may know, that Mrs. Rigid inform|ed the late Mr. Mandeville of your unfatherlike conduct; that he invited her and his grand daughter to his hou&s;e, and taking a fancy to Mi&s;s Albina, he made her his hei|re&s;s. There now you've heard the whole &s;tory; and I &s;hall call it friend&s;hip, if you'll pay me my two hundred pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not write letters!&mdash;Not remit money!&mdash;Hear me, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not now. The Heire&s;s is expected from Dover every moment, and I mu&s;t go and prepare the Ca&s;tle for her reception. Come along, Poacher; come and deliver your keys to your &s;ucce&s;&s;or&mdash;I'll take out a writ direct|ly, and he &s;ha'n't &s;lip through my fingers a &s;econd time&mdash; <STAGE><HI>[a&s;ide.]</HI></STAGE> No more di&s;gui&s;es, Mr. Mandeville&mdash;No more Sunday men, Mr. Steward.&mdash;"Oh! what trouble will the old gentleman's death occa&s;ion to my poor ma&s;ter!"</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Mi|$icking Robert, and exit with Cop&s;ley at the Ca&s;tle gate.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now all's out, Sir. No wonder at our not receiv|ing an&s;wers, when they &s;ay we &s;ent no letters. Oh that diabolical Governe&s;s! I always &s;aid you were to blame, to place your only child under her care; particularly when
<PB N="9" REF="9">you knew &s;he was once in love with you, and you refu&s;ed her, and married her cou&s;in, Mi&s;s Herbert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, name not her! If my Amelia had &s;urvived, I &s;hould not have been doomed unheard!&mdash;What! de&s;ert|ed! di&s;inherited!&mdash;Is this my welcome home? Am I to find a father dead, and dying full of re&s;entment again&s;t me? a daughter prejudiced! nay, perhaps cur&s;ing my ve|ry name, and this Governe&s;s&mdash;Speak, Sir; ju&s;tify your injured ma&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will with my life, Sir; but don't be &s;atisfied with Realize's &s;tory: let us get information el&s;ewhere. Yonder is the hou&s;e of Sir Solomon Cynic. If the old gentleman hasn't fretted away his life by railing at the follies of wo|mankind, perhaps he lives to con&s;ole and befriend you. Shall we go to him, Sir?.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Take me where you will <STAGE><HI>[Going, &s;tops].</HI></STAGE> Robert, how old was Albina when we la&s;t &s;aw her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>About four years, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And I left her in the fond hope, that I might one day find in her a recompen&s;e for the lo&s;s of her mother! And now if I behold her, &s;he will avoid&mdash;upbraid me! That thought is pa&s;t all bearing. I'll know the wor&s;t, and then my fate's decided. They may de&s;ert, but they &s;hall not de&s;pi&s;e me!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who? This Tutor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No; his Pupil. I flatter my&s;elf Albina has no &s;light partiality for her father's friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For you! How, and where, did you know her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you. When I and my Tutor arrived from the grand tour, we found Albina and the Governe&s;s at Dover. Mr. Veritas and Mrs. Rigid being related, we often paid them vi&s;its; and while the &s;choolma&s;ter and &s;choolmi&s;tre&s;s morali&s;ed on the mi&s;eries of the world, their two &s;cholars as naturally conver&s;ed on its plea&s;ures. In &s;ho$$, we &s;oon laughed our&s;elves into an attachment;
<PB N="13" REF="13">which the Governe&s;s perceiving, Albina was locked up, I turned out, and the Tutor de&s;tined for her hu&s;band.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!&mdash;And did &s;he&mdash;forgive my weakne&s;s, Sir&mdash;did &s;he once name her father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Often: but the Governe&s;s has in&s;tilled into her young mind &s;uch notions of your barbarity, and at the &s;ame time of her own benevolence that &s;he looks on her as a pa|rent; you as an enemy. However, don't de&s;pair&mdash;if we can once gain an interview&mdash;And what &s;ay you? Shall we go to the Ca&s;tle directly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Twill be in vain. The gates will be &s;hut again&s;t us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never mind: we'll force them open. Come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay: but con&s;ider you are dependent on your uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No matter. The hope that the name of How|ard may &s;till be dear to him, who now has &s;o much cau&s;e to cur&s;e it, makes me &s;uperior to all &s;elfi&s;h thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible? You that have had a fa&s;hionable education! you that have been &s;chooled in all the arts of modern foppery, and foreign folly! you to be the only one to pity or befriend me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the fact is, they tried hard to &s;poil me; but I wouldn't let them&mdash;they &s;ent me all over the Conti|nent, before I'd been half over England; taught me fo|reign languages, before I knew my own; in&s;tructed me how to pick my teeth all the morning in Bond &s;treet; yawn all night at the Opera. But I was a bad &s;cholar, Mr. Mandeville: and the &s;atisfaction I feel at this moment proves I did right to educate my&s;elf.&mdash;Now then for Albi|na! They may have perverted my head; but I a&s;&s;ure you they hav'n't corrupted my heart.</P>

Well, what &s;ay you. Mr. Mandeville?&mdash;How &s;hall we puni&s;h the&s;e two culprits? Shall we inflict matrimony, or &s;eparation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Matrimony, by all means! Don't you think &s;o, Sir?</P>
<STAGE><HI>[To Mandeville.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do, indeed! The day that gives Albina &s;uch a hu&s;band, and makes me father of &s;uch a &s;on as Howard, mu&s;t be the proude&s;t and happie&s;t of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Say you &s;o? Then take her George! And if the marriage &s;tate can afford happine&s;s&mdash;However, we won't talk of impo&s;&s;ibilities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Albina, will you ever talk of Cicely again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Will you ever call me Becky again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Becky!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If you do, I'll make you a companion to the wild goo&s;e in the cottage. "I hope your lungs are better, Sir?"</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Reminding him by her voice and attitude.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! Were you Bobadil? Were you the little &s;mart, well-made Lieutenant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I was young Herbert, Sir; and I ble&s;s the di&s;gui&s;e, not only for convincing me of the &s;incerity of my lover, but al&s;o for introducing me to my father. I hope you don't blame me. Sir?&mdash;</P>
<STAGE><HI>[To Mandeville.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He blame you! No: Howard has mo&s;t rea&s;on. What will your hu&s;band &s;ay to your &s;trutting about in boy's clothes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Say! That I wi&s;h all women would wear the breeches before marriage, in&s;tead of afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cop&s;.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam! How &s;hall I thank you? You have &s;aved me and my family from ruin.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="57" REF="57">
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have, Madam! and we are all gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is your benefactor; you are to thank my fa|ther, not me. If you wi&s;h to do me a favour&mdash;why, there is one&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, name it, Madam! name it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why it rather concerns Sir Solomon than my&s;elf. Pray be kind enough to have the old curtain repaired, left he &s;hould again wi&s;h to take cover behind it. And like|wi&s;e, to &s;end me &s;ome of the &s;traw&mdash;I mean to be married in a &s;traw hat&mdash;and I'll have one manufactured out of Sir Solomon's &s;tubble!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>One! We'll have a dozen! And our children &s;hall wear them, in honour of their great uncle's gallantry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Gallantry! P&s;hal I've &s;omething better to think of than women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you have not. Come, come, Uncle&mdash;Rail at the &s;ex as much as you like, you mu&s;t confe&s;s, that life is a blank without them; and the gaming-table, the bottle, and the &s;ports of the field, are all &s;o many &s;ub&s;titutes&mdash;&s;hadows!&mdash;Woman is the true &s;ub&s;tance, after all&mdash;And, compared to her, all other objects are as the glow worm to the &s;un! It may dazzle the fight&mdash;but it can never warm the heart! Don't you think &s;o, Albina.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do, indeed. Women are certainly mo&s;t &s;uperior creatures; and, if by accident they have any faults, men ought not to &s;ee them&mdash;At lea&s;t, I hope that will be my ca&s;e to night. I have done and talked a great many foo|li&s;h things: but having their hands, and full pardon <STAGE><HI>[Standing between Mandeville and Howard];</HI></STAGE> let me have yours&mdash;and Albina will be the happie&s;t of wives, and the mo&s;t grateful of daughters.</P>

<L>THE World's a Stage&mdash;and Man has Seven Ages</L>
<L>So Shake&s;peare writes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The idea of this parody of the Seven Ages of Shake&s;peare, was &s;ugge&s;ted to Mr. Reynolds by his friend Mr. Rogers (Author of The Plea&s;ures to Memory), and the lines printed in Italies were furai&s;hed by him.</NOTE>&mdash;King of Dramatic Sages;</L>
<L>But he forgot to tell you in his plan,</L>
