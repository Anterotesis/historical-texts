<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>THE Great, the Good, the Wi&s;e, in every Age,</L>
<L>Have made a moral Mirrour of the Stage;</L>
<L>While, to the Shame and Spite of ta&s;tele&s;s Fools,</L>
<L><HI>Terence</HI> &s;till reigns a Cla&s;&s;ic in our Schools:</L>
<L>But now the <HI>DRAMA</HI> fears a &s;ad Decline,</L>
<L>And peevi&s;h Hypocrites its Fall combine.</L>
<L>From Stage to Stage, behold our Author to&s;s'd,</L>
<L>And but for you, his Genius cru&s;h'd and lo&s;t.</L>
<L>No <HI>Wilks</HI>, no <HI>Booth!</HI> his Labours to requite,</L>
<L>He here takes &s;helter, &s;tudious to delight.</L>
<L>But to our <HI>FARCE</HI>&mdash;It has a double Aim,</L>
<L>To honour Wedlock, and put Fools to Shame;</L>
<L>Folly and Prejudice, too near a Kin,</L>
<L>Supply pert Coxcombs with eternal Grin;</L>
<L>So infinitely &s;tupid is their Mirth,</L>
<L>They'll ridicule one's very Place of Birth,</L>
<L>And cry, <HI>An hone&s;t York&s;hire-Man! a Wonder!</HI></L>
<L>But let them &s;hoot their Bolts, let Blockheads blunder.</L>
<L>The glorious Heroes of the <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Line,</L>
<L>To Times la&s;t Period &s;hall in Annals &s;hine;</L>
<L>While &s;land'ring Slaves, who would tho&s;e Honours blot,</L>
<L>Shall unregarded live,&mdash;and die forgot,</L>
<L>Mean and unmanly is &s;uch partial Spite,</L>
<L>Aver&s;e to Nature's Laws, to Rea&s;on's Light;</L>
<L>All Fellow-Creatures, &s;ure, &s;hould &s;ocial be,</L>
<L>Nay, even to Brutes we owe Humanity.</L>
<L>Our Author does in Virtue's Cau&s;e engage,</L>
<L>In hopes to make her &s;hine upon the Stage;</L>
<L>A mode&s;t Entertainment we intend,</L>
<L>Willing to plea&s;e, yet fearful to offend;</L>
<L>Indulge us therefore, if you can't commend.</L>
