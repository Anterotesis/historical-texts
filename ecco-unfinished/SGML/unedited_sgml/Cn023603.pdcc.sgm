<P>THE <HI>Malade Imaginaire</HI> of Moliere fir&s;t &s;ug|ge&s;ted the idea of <HI>The Spleen,</HI> the Author of which has however deviated without &s;cruple from his admirable original. The readers of the agreeable e&s;&s;ays under the title of <HI>The $iler,</HI> will al&s;o di&s;cover &s;ome <HI>traits</HI> of D'Oyley in that writer's de&s;cription of Drugget's retirement, as well as &s;ome features of Rubrick in his charact$r of Whi$ler. Any other <HI>gleanings,</HI> as the Prologue neatly terms them, I do not recollect, except that I have before exhibited a young Cantabrigian at Newmarket, in one of the Numbers of The Connoi&s;&s;eur; in which papers, as well as other popular e&s;&s;ays, there are al&s;o frequent allu&s;ions to the &s;hort excur&s;ions and &s;uburb villas of our citizens.&mdash;It has (I am told) been a&s;&s;erted in one of our daily prints&mdash;the <HI>Gazetteer,</HI> or <HI>Gar|retteer</HI>&mdash; I forget the name of it&mdash;that for the idea of <HI>the Noon-Po&s;t</HI> I am indebted to my decea&s;ed friend BONNEL THORNTON. No body was more ca|pable of giving excellent hints; there was nobody who&s;e hints I would more readily have embraced, or more chearfully acknowledged. But the a&s;&s;er|tion is totally fal&s;e. It is not the fir&s;t time that my enemies have paid me a compliment they did not in|tend, by a&s;cribing my feeble productions to more eminent writers. I will endeavour not to be vain of their cen&s;ures; though perhaps they will think me &s;o, in adopting the words of Terence on the occa&s;ion.</P>

<P><HI>NAturam intueri &amp; &s;equi</HI> is e|qually the province of the dramati&s;t and phy&s;ician; and could I trace the windings of the human heart with half that &s;kill and &s;agacity that you have applied to the di&s;orders of the body, I &s;hould, by mere force of talent, &s;ecure to my&s;elf a re|&s;pectable &s;eat in the college. Even among regulars, there is often found a tincture of empirici&s;m, not un|worthy ridicule: for there are too few who, like you, have hone&s;ty and fortitude to confe&s;s the imper|fection of art, and the uncertainty of &s;cience.

<P>HOW tedious is the time, when expectation obliges us to mark its progre&s;s!

<P>My Eliza ju&s;t come to town! My arrival is critical.

<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! Tom Merton in England? and in London too? My old friend and &s;chool-fel|low! how do you? your hand, Tom! I did not think you had been in our hemi&s;phere. A commi&s;|&s;ion took you from us in the middle of We&s;tmin|&s;ter college; and how has it di&s;po&s;ed of you &s;ince, Tom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For three years, my dear Jack, I have been &s;tationed at Gibraltar, from whence I have been returned, with the re&s;t of the regiment, little more than &s;o many months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So you have been &s;tudying the Tacticks at the Hercules Pillars, while I have been cudgelling the Mathematicks at Cambrigde. How we diverge, like rays, from the &s;ame centre! We walk through life together indeed, but &s;eem hitherto, like parallel lines, de&s;tined never to meet. But I am heartily glad of this encounter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And I as heartily.&mdash;But by your boots and your language, Jack, I &s;hould imagine you to be ju&s;t fre&s;h from the Univer&s;ity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have hit it. I am &s;o.&mdash;Not immediately though&mdash;for I flew off in a tangent the beginning of la&s;t week to Newmarket. It was the &s;econd Spring meeting; and I cho&s;e to take the Sun's altitude on the cour&s;e every day, make a few ob&s;ervations (during the heats) upon matter and motion, with as many calculations, as a Lot|tery-Office-keeper, on the Doctrine of Chances.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sport! you talk as if you were &s;peak in gof a common country race. They never think of port. It is all <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> at Newmarket, man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, was the bu&s;ine&s;s good, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Many thought excellent; but it was quite in an inver&s;e <HI>ratio</HI> to me, Tom! Four&s;core <HI>minus,</HI> I promi&s;e you. My quarter's allowance, which I had ju&s;t received at Lady-day, (thirty guineas!) gone.&mdash;Reduced to &s;ell my little hor&s;e <HI>Pho&s;phorus</HI> for thirty more! Gone. And I was obliged to give a promi&s;&s;ory note for twenty more.&mdash; So that if you under&s;tand Algebra but half &s;o well as I do, Tom, you will find by all the powers of numbers, that I was ju&s;t eighty guineas a lo&s;er.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thirty and thirty, and twenty! Four|&s;core exactly, Jack! I have ju&s;t &s;o much arithme|tick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The woods were all hollow in my favour too! Were you ever at Newmarket?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ill tell you then&mdash;It was a four mile heat on the long cour&s;e&mdash;a match between Pan|theon, Jubilee, Duenna, and Gabrielli!&mdash;At fir&s;t going off they kept pretty even together; Jubilee and Duenna, Pantheon and Gabrielli, cheek by jowl, and formed a kind of Parallelogram.&mdash;When they came to de&s;cribe a circle on the Round Cour&s;e, you might almo&s;t as &s;oon have &s;quared the circle, as have told which would be the winner. Then away they went, whip and &s;pur, through the Devil's ditch, like the Devil him&s;elf!&mdash;Coming up Choakjade, Pantheon lagged behind. Gabrielli, though &s;ome thought her touched in the wind, got a-head of the other two; and &s;he before, with Jubilee and Duenna abre&s;t of each other, formed an equilateral triangle&mdash;A thou&s;and pound to a china orange on Gabrielli! when all of a &s;udden, with a damned eccentrick motion, &s;he made an acute angle on the wrong &s;ide of the po&s;t&mdash;Jubilee &s;tarted and &s;tumbled&mdash;but by the bye, I believe his ri$e$

<P>And poor Jack Rubrick into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Poor indeed, Tom! I di&s;covered as ab&s;olute a <HI>vacuum</HI> in my breeches pockets, as in tho&s;e of a heathen philo&s;opher: I would fain have been among the red ribbands and black legs at <HI>Hell</HI> in the evening, and tried my luck with to&s;&s;ing the <HI>cubes</HI> about&mdash;but not a &s;ingle guinea left to bribe my fortune, or take me off the cour&s;e. By good luck, Frank Whip of Clare Hall was there, and being on a &s;cheme to London, brought me up to town in his phaeton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And what's your bu&s;ine&s;s here, Jack?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Partly to get a fre&s;h recruit from Old Square-toes. I might have made out a li&s;t of mathematical books for a &s;upply&mdash;but as the Devil will have it, he &s;ells books him&s;elf, you know.&mdash;So there's no hopes in that quarter&mdash;but I was obliged to come up, in order to attend the marriage of my &s;i&s;ter Eliza.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Merton.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have. But Eliza will never be his wife, Jack.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Rubrick.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but &s;he will though! He may like her, and &s;he not like him, it is true, Tom. There may be all the powers of attraction and re|pul&s;ion between them, perhaps. But they'll be married within the&s;e ten days, for all that, my friend.</P>

<P>Well, but Mr. Merton! I can tell you no more than you have heard over and over already.

What they are to be, I don't exactly know; and were I fully apprized of them, being enjoined &s;ecrecy, I tell you plainly, I would not di&s;clo&s;e them.

He enjoys the air of the New Road every day, takes a whet at Mother Red|cap's, trots up to Hamp&s;tead, cro&s;&s;es the Heath, comes down Highgate Hill, and &s;o through Hollo|way, back to I&s;lington.

I &s;ee how it is, at once, Sir! Your appetite is good, and dige&s;tion bad; your &s;leep &s;ound, but refre&s;hment little; &s;trength great, but nerves weak; and your whole habit, pa|regorick, and hypochondriacal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My ca&s;e to a tittle! But you amaze me. Are you Dr. Anodyne? You a phy&s;ician, Sir?</P>

<PB N="24" REF="31">
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure. Why &s;hould you doubt it, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>By your figure and appearance, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Sir, I &s;hould rather have taken you for a foreign Count, or an Opera-&s;inger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o, Sir? Do you think it nece&s;&s;ary for a phy&s;ician to appear like an undertaker? Thank Heaven I am the fir&s;t of the faculty. Sir, that made it proper and fa&s;hionable in this country for a phy|&s;ician to look like a gentleman. I have &s;pent a good deal of time abroad, Sir; and even our Clergy, when abroad, moult their feather'd grizzles, ca&s;t their pudding &s;leeves, and put on white &s;tockings, long &s;words, and bag-wigs, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! &s;ome of them are coming pretty near the mark at home, Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have had the honour of travelling, Sir, and I thought it right to adopt the modes, as well as &s;cience, of the &s;everal countries I vi&s;ited. For|merly, the grave owls of the College, with their clouted cravats, hay-cock perukes, clouded canes, and bolus buttons, &s;eemed to think no man qualified to pre&s;cribe a cathartick or emetick, that did not look, as if he had ju&s;t taken one him&s;elf.&mdash;And their practice was as ab&s;urd, as their figures were ridicu|$ous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Doctor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, Sir. A con&s;ultation of mere home-bred phy&s;icians, is wor&s;e than an epide|mick di&s;temper. The plague, or the <HI>influenza</HI> is nothing to it.&mdash;Your ca&s;e for in&s;tance! By your ap|pearance, I &s;hould judge your ca&s;e to have been wholly mi&s;taken. It appears at fir&s;t to have been merely nervous; but now, by improper manage|ment, it &s;eems tending very $a&s;t to epileptick, para|lytick, and drop&s;ical</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You frighten me. What cour&s;e would you pre&s;cribe, Doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What regimen have you followed hither|to, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="32">
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have been ordered to live very tempe|rate, to ride every day, and to keep my &s;pirits quiet and ea&s;y.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! temperance, exerci&s;e, and peace of mind! the old remedy, and a wonderful di&s;co|very to be &s;ure! But your diet! Give me the par|ticulars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D$Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Plain food, no wine, and no pickles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Wrong, wrong, all wrong! Your tem|perament being too low, nature plainly directs that you &s;hould live very high. A bottle of wine would operate as the mo&s;t excellent cordial, and the &s;ti|mulation of pickles would both create and &s;trengthen the appetite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can be more reasonable. I mu&s;t alter my whole regimen, and enrich my blood with good eating and drinking&mdash;take chocolate for break|fa&s;t, a chearful gla&s;s for dinner, and make a hearty &s;upper.&mdash;How many grains of &s;alt may I put to an egg, Doctor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>None. Eat &s;alt in no &s;hape, unle&s;s &s;alted meats,&mdash;but as much of tho&s;e as you plea&s;e, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Meats &s;alted or &s;moaked, are what I have been expre&s;sly forbid, Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not by me, Mr. D'Oyley. Con&s;ult your own under&s;tanding, Sir! How &s;hould &s;moke, that pre&s;erves a flitch of bacon, injure you; or &s;alt, that keeps a ham from putrefaction, hurt the tone of your &s;tomach? Cookery indeed renders many things unwhole&s;ome, that are not &s;o in them&s;elves. How is your meat dre&s;t, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D$Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thoroughly done, always&mdash;for el&s;e, the Doctors tell me, that the juices would not a&s;&s;i|milate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For which rea&s;on they leave the food without any juices at all. Without them, Sir, in|&s;tead of beef or mutton, you might as well eat mo|hogany. In Aby&s;&s;inia, where a &s;tate of nature pre|vails, a raw ra&s;her from a live ox is whole&s;ome and

delicious. Eat your meat as rare as po&s;&s;ible, Sir, and avoid bread as pernicious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>D'Oyley.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pernicious, Doctor! I always under|&s;tood bread to be the whole&s;ome&s;t food in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Laetitia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A vulgar error, Sir! Pap, mere pap, kills nine-tents of the children that die in the Foundling Ho&s;pital. Bread and milk &s;well the bills of mortality. Bread induces a cach$xy, and milk brings on an a$rophy. The London milk too is no|thing but a compo&s;ition of chalk and rain water, and the bread is all whitened with a$lum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
