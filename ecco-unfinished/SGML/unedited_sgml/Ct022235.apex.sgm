<HEAD>TO The REV. MR BAIN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not troubled the public with a|ny reply to the Sermon you addre&s;&s;ed to me; not, as you fondly imagine, becau&s;e your arguments were unan&s;werable, but becau&s;e I really did not think they de&s;erved an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The utility of the MINOR has been felt and acknowledged by all orders and degrees of men in the country where it was fir&s;t produced, with an exception indeed to tho&s;e &s;ubjects who were unhappily tainted with the principles that dra|matic piece was intended to combat. To rea&s;on with tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;edly give up the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of their rea&s;on, would be <HI>non aliter quam &s;i des operam ut cum ratione in&s;anires.</HI></P>
<P>Had you, Sir, enjoyed your &s;uppo&s;ed &s;upe|riority
<PB N="4" REF="4">
in &s;ilence, or been &s;atisfied with the pri|vate congratulatory bleatings of the unfortunate flock you fodder, I &s;hould not have made a &s;ingle attempt to &s;ully your triumph: but as you have thought fit, in the public papers, to celebrate, with a degree of wanton in&s;olence, not very con&s;i&s;tent with the pretended piety of your principles, and the humility of your pro|fe&s;&s;ion, a victory, which, like the great Tom Thumb, you have attained, not by vanqui&s;h|ing your foes, but in finding no foes to van|qui&s;h; it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to let you &s;ee, that, with the town of Geneva, you owe your &s;trength to your weakne&s;s; and that you have been hi|therto &s;pared, not from the want of arms or courage, but from a real principle of com|pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The greater part of your Sermon, con&s;i&s;t|ing of &s;elf-evident principles, &s;u&s;tained by hack|neyed quotations, badly arranged and ill ex|pre&s;&s;ed, I &s;hall give you all the credit that the communication of &s;uch tritical truths de&s;erves.</P>
<P>In the conclu&s;ion, indeed, or your precious mor&s;el of eloquence, you make an application of the&s;e principles to the Comedy in que&s;tion; but as all you &s;ay there, has been &s;aid before, and much better, I take the liberty of &s;ubmit|ting to the public the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wrote by the Rev. Mr. M&mdash;d&mdash;n.</NOTE> Objections originally made to the MINOR, by one of the &s;ounders of the methodi&s;tical &s;ect, with my an&s;wers; both
<PB N="5" REF="5">
which were publi&s;hed immediately after the fir&s;t exhibition of the MINOR.</P>
<P>As the pamphlets them&s;elves are too bulky for the room of a letter, I have &s;atisfied my&s;elf with an extract, which contains the &s;ub&s;tance of each; and, for the more di&s;tinctne&s;s, &s;hall &s;tate the Objections as they occur, with my An&s;wers to each immediately following.</P>
<P>The Objections have for title: <Q>&startq;CHRISTIAN and CRITICAL Remarks on a <HI>Droll</HI> or <HI>Inter|lude,</HI> called the MINOR, <HI>&s;aid to be acted by authority.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
<P>To this title, I give for an&s;wer, That the MINOR is not a Droll or Interlude. A Droll, if it is the &s;ame as the Interlude, was a part of the entertainment among&s;t the Greeks, and was performed by the chorus. In our theatres it is the dance, and at Tottenham-Court it is the ballad, or mu&s;ical entertainment, which fills up the &s;pace between the different parts of the performance: but a Droll is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be a kind of theatrical, not a dra|matic entertainment, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Farce,</HI> and is a &s;ort of hodge-podge, where the mangled limbs of probability, common &s;en&s;e, and decency, are &s;erved up to gratify the voracious cravings of the mo&s;t depraved ap|petites. But a Comedy is an exact repre&s;enta|tion of the peculiar manners of that people a|mong whom it happens to be performed; a faithful imitation of ab&s;urdities and follies,
<PB N="6" REF="6">
made for the correction of individuals, and an example to the community: &s;o that it is not the extent, but the object of the piece, that deter|mines the title. A poem of one act may be an excellent comedy, and a play of five a mo&s;t ex|ecrable farce; and I hope, that the characters in the MINOR are not &s;trained above the mo|de&s;ty of nature, nor their employment un&s;uit|able to their rank, or incon&s;i&s;tent with their &s;ituation.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erv.]</HI> Mr Foote has &s;hot a bow's length beyond any of his competitors, in debauching, if po&s;&s;ible, and deba&s;ing the &s;tage; by doing that which nobody el&s;e in the&s;e kingdoms ever had the confidence to attempt; by the intro|duction of real and living characters into his pieces. That this was the original method of comedy nobody can deny; but the &s;en&s;ible A|thenians found the ill con&s;equence of it. So|crates, that divine philo&s;opher, (if we may call him divine, who was almo&s;t a heathen through the unhappy prejudice of education), was al|lowed to be the fir&s;t man for wi&s;dom and vir|tue, not only in Greece, famous for great men; but in the whole world: yet this man, when he was in his highe&s;t reputation, when the prin|cipal youth of Athens were under his tuition; and his advice was taken in the mo&s;t important and difficult affairs; this very man, at this very time, could not with all his glory get the better of the ridicule of Ari&s;tophanes; who, in a co|medy called <HI>the Clouds,</HI> made a je&s;t of him with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that though the people of Athens
<PB N="7" REF="7">
idolized Socrates next to their gods, they run after this burle&s;que foppery night after night; and &s;ome of the be&s;t writers have dated the fall of the greate&s;t pagan philo&s;opher that ever lived, from the fir&s;t exhibition of this contemp|tible farce, which, however it might appear in acting, is &s;uch a poor piece of writing, that it is very little &s;uperior to the MINOR.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> In this charge you are, Sir, at once erroneous and unju&s;t: You err in your notions of the nature of the ancient comedy, and are unju&s;t in attributing its revival to me, when, at the &s;ame time, that honour is &s;olely due to the reverend gentleman who&s;e advocate you are. But for the better determining this que&s;tion, let us con&s;ider where the &s;pecific difference lyes, between the ancient, middle, and modern co|medy.</P>
<P>The ancient comedy was a repre&s;entation of real per&s;ons and facts; in the middle comedy, the per&s;ons were real, and the facts feigned; in the modern, both the per&s;ons and the facts were fictitious. Now, Sir, though in the MINOR you may call &s;ome of the characters real, yet you mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, allow the fable to be an in|vention; that piece, therefore, wants ju&s;t half its con&s;truction to be ranked in the order of an|cient comedies. But let us, on the other hand, con&s;ider the claims of your Hero for a niche near The&s;pis in the temple of Apollo; and for this purpo&s;e we will examine one of his pieces, at which I was a &s;pectator. The piece is pretty
<PB N="8" REF="8">
well known, and after the manner of Ari&s;to|phanes and Plautus we will di&s;tingui&s;h it from the principal incident, by the name of <HI>Mutton,</HI> a comedy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Epilogue to the MINOR, annexed.</NOTE>. As an introduction to this enter|tainment, we were told by the chorus or pro|logue, that the per&s;ons were then living, that the dialogue really happened between them, and that the cata&s;trophe of the leg of mutton and turnips, was a literal fact. In this compo&s;ition you fee, Sir, we have at once every member of the ancient comedy. The method of declaim|ing or conveying it, too, was preci&s;ely after the Greek in recitative; and tho' we had not the accompaniment of the <HI>tibiae dextrae</HI> and <HI>&s;ini|&s;trae,</HI> yet a melodious na&s;al twang, produced by an orche&s;tra of old women, who &s;urrounded the actor, amply &s;upplied that deficiency. To this when I add, that, after the manner of The&s;pis, the piece was exhibited in a cart upon a common, not a &s;ingle doubt can, I think, remain. <HI>Dicitur et plau&s;tris vexi&s;&s;e poemata The&s;pis.</HI> Perhaps the critics may object to the divine machinery of this piece, as believing the leg of mutton might have been produced with propriety enough by natural means. <HI>Nec Deus inter&s;it ni&s;i dignus vindice nodus.</HI> But as the mo|del of the mutton was produced previous to the exi&s;tence of Ari&s;totle or Horace, it would be ab|&s;urd, in a profe&s;&s;ed imitator of that model, to be directed by their rules. From this di&s;qui&s;ition, then, Sir, and the earne&s;t inclination your reve|rend friend always &s;hows to di&s;play his abilities in a
<PB N="9" REF="9">
cart, even though it be with a criminal to Ty|burn, I think we may venture, without any impeachment of our under&s;tanding, to pro|nounce him the real re&s;torer of the ancient The&s;pian cart-comedy.</P>
<P>You affirm, with an intrepidity which, con|&s;idering your ignorance in dramatic produc|tions, is a little a&s;toni&s;hing, that Mr Foote, among&s;t the moderns, is the only man who has produced real characters upon the &s;tage.&mdash;What think you of a countryman of ours, one Shake&s;peare? In travelling through his page, did you never meet with a boori&s;h, illiterate, trifling, tedious country Ju&s;tice called <HI>Shallow?</HI> Have you never heard that this man's real name was <HI>Lucy?</HI> and that his inflexible &s;everity to our author, for a venial &s;lip in his youth, pro|cured him a &s;eat in the temple of folly, con|demned to everla&s;ting fame?</P>
<P>Your next anathema is thundered out again&s;t one Ari&s;tophanes, a certain Greek comic poet, who&s;e di&s;ciple you pronounce me to be; and to the unbounded licence of who&s;e execrable farces, produced and fo&s;tered by the corruption and depravity of the age, the untimely death of Socrates was owing. As to any re&s;emblance you think you may have di&s;covered between my little piece and the works of that great ma|&s;ter, I am too much flattered with the compa|ri&s;on to think of pointing out your mi&s;take; I leave that ta&s;k to my enemies: But from what quarter did you collect the re&s;t of your mate|rials?
<PB N="10" REF="10">
you mu&s;t have either lo&s;t your hi&s;torical knowledge, or have &s;uck'd from &s;ome muddy gutter the impure &s;tream with which you pol|lute the brighte&s;t period the world ever &s;aw. This was the aera when the Attic genius tri|umphed; when its liberty was pure and virtu|ous; when a citizen could have gone from a conference with Socrates, to an oration from Demo&s;thenes, and have clo&s;ed his evening with the Electra of Sophocles, the Phaedra of Euri|pides, the moral &s;cenes of Menander, or the &s;prightly comic mu&s;e of Ari&s;tophanes. Then flouri&s;hed Plato, Xenophon, Ari&s;totle, I&s;ocrates, Thu$ydides, and E&s;chylus, men born to en|lighten the human mind, and diffu&s;e the glory of their country to late&s;t po&s;terity. No, Sir, the &s;acrifice of Socrates was re&s;erved for the age of bigotry and abject &s;lavery, when Ly|&s;ander had changed the con&s;titution of Athens, from a Democracy to an Ari&s;tocracy, when the thirty rulers had e&s;tabli&s;hed an ab&s;olute ty|ranny. The <HI>Clouds</HI> was exhibited in the eighth year of the Peloponne&s;ian war, at lea&s;t twenty-&s;ix years before the death of Socrates. Could a little &s;light harmle&s;s raillery, at what, per|haps, were &s;oibles in the character of that great man, have excited &s;uch an inflammation in the minds of the multitude? it mu&s;t have been at the time when Socrates was upon the &s;pot, in the very theatre where he had been drawn, to make a di&s;covery of his own imperfections, with a declared re&s;olution to amend them. But the real truth is, Sir, Socrates fell for the very fact which you charge as a crime upon
<PB N="11" REF="11">
Ari&s;tophanes; for his free, &s;pirited, and per|&s;onal invectives again&s;t Critias, one of the thir|ty rulers. The re&s;entment of that tyrant, joined by the hatred the public bore Socrates, for ha|ving been the in&s;tructor, the preceptor of that very Critias, were the unhappy, only in&s;tru|ments, that, before his time, clo&s;ed the eyes of that fir&s;t of philo&s;ophers, who&s;e not being a Chri&s;tian I do not, like you, impute to the vice of his education; for let that have been as it would, there &s;eems to be an almo&s;t in&s;uperable ob&s;tacle to his ever joining in one communion with us, viz. that he died in the 95th olym|piad, ju&s;t 399 years before Chri&s;t was born.</P>
<P><HI>Rem.]</HI> Whether the paultry reflection ca&s;t upon a preacher of God's word, in the name of <HI>Squintum,</HI> be equitable, I leave to the world; nay, even to Mr Foote him&s;elf: for if the ac|cidental unhappine&s;s of a provincial dialect is not a proper &s;ubject for ridicule, how much le&s;s are the errors of nature in matters of bo|dily defect?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> Provincial dialects are not the proper objects of comedy; <HI>and if not dialects,</HI> &s;urely much le&s;s natural infirmities. Granted.</P>
<P>But if men, with the&s;e infirmities, will attempt things which tho&s;e very infirmities have render|ed them incapable of properly executing, it is their own fault, if the &s;ource that &s;hould ac|quire them compa&s;&s;ion, degenerates into a foun|tain of ridicule. My Lord Lane&s;borough's gout
<PB N="12" REF="12">
would have hardly found a place in Mr Pope's page, if it had not hobbled a minuet at court; nor &s;hould Mr <HI>Squintum</HI> have &s;hown the whites of his eyes at the Hay-market, if he had con|fined his circum&s;pection to the tap-room of the Bell at Glouce&s;ter; or, after his admi&s;&s;ion to the mini&s;try, mode&s;tly &s;ubmitted to the decent duties of a country cure: but if, in de&s;pite of art and nature, not content with depreciating every individual of his own order; with a coun|tenance, not only inexpre&s;&s;ive, but ludicrous; a dialect, not only provincial, but barbarous; a deportment, not only aukward, but &s;avage; he will produce him&s;elf to the whole public, and there deliver doctrines equally heretical and ab&s;urd, in a language at once inelegant and ungrammatical, he mu&s;t expect to have his pre|ten&s;ions to oratory derided, his &s;incerity &s;u|&s;pected, and the truth of his mi&s;&s;ion denied.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erv]</HI> I do not rightly know what is meant by enthu&s;ia&s;m: if people mean by enthu&s;ia&s;m, that the Methodi&s;ts pretend to the extraordi|nary operation of working miracles, or &s;peaking with tongues, they are no enthu&s;ia&s;ts, for they never laid claim to any &s;uch thing. But if they only mean, that enthu&s;ia&s;m is a &s;trong per&s;ua|&s;ion of the mind, that we are guided in an ex|traordinary manner by immediate impul&s;es and impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;pirit of God; then, perhaps, they may not injure them.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> Are you really puzzled for the preci&s;e meaning of the word Enthu&s;ia&s;m? Why, then,
<PB N="13" REF="13">
I will give it to you; but take this by the way, that the term was never applied by me to the leader of the Methodi&s;ts, but to his deluded di&s;ciples only; for the very e&s;&s;ence of an enthu|&s;ia&s;t is, that though mi&s;taken, he is &s;incere; though erroneous, he is in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>Enthu&s;ia&s;m, in divinity, is a kind of a reli|gious phren&s;y, that mi&s;takes the dictates of an inflamed imagination, the vapours of a troubled brain, for the operation of a divine po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the effects of an immediate in&s;piration: nor is it material, that the enthu&s;ia&s;t &s;hould think him&s;elf the per&s;on in&s;pired; if his di&s;tempered judgment be&s;tows the &s;ame attribute on any other individual, his delu&s;ion is the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erv.]</HI> The &s;tage is of Pagan origin.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> So is &s;culpture, painting, and not only all the elegant, but mo&s;t of the u&s;eful arts.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erv.]</HI> The &s;tage was invented for the ho|nour and wor&s;hip of daemons.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> If by their daemons you mean as they did their gods, you are right enough.</P>
<P>And where could they better employ it? To the&s;e people you would &s;urely permit &s;ome re|ligious wor&s;hip; but you will in&s;i&s;t that they ought all to have been Chri&s;tians; though dead before Chri&s;t came into the world.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14">
<HI>Ob&s;erv.]</HI> Pagans, who had no regard to virtue, abominated theatres, as &s;eminaries of vice.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> Who were the&s;e Pagans? And when and where did they live?</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erv.]</HI> The diver&s;ions of the &s;tage, though at fir&s;t encouraged, were afterwards di&s;counte|nanced by the Greeks and Romans.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> Ju&s;t the contrary is true; and plays were in &s;uch e&s;timation in Greece, that the ex|hibition of the tragedies of Sophocles alone, co&s;t the Athenian &s;tate more than the whole Peloponne&s;ian war; and the profe&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage was at that time &s;o far from contemptible, that even their amba&s;&s;adors were &s;elected from the body of the players. They were not indeed in equal repute at Rome, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that in the decline of the empire, the practice of the bar fell into di&s;grace, becau&s;e the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of both became mercenaries: but &s;till the dramatic authors had a Scipio, a Laelius, a Maecenas, an Augu&s;tus, for their patrons; and to &s;um up all the&s;e names in one, the actors had a Cicero for their friend. The Romans were &s;o far from ever di&s;countenancing dra|matic performances, that one of the fathers you have quoted, St Augu&s;tine, ob&s;erves, that 436 years after Chri&s;t, the theatres began to be clo&s;ed in the great towns of Italy, owing to the incur&s;ions of the Goths and Vandals, <HI>Ni&s;i forte hinc &s;ine tempora mala quia per omnes civitates cadunt theatra.</HI> And Ca&s;&s;iodorus, who wrote
<PB N="15" REF="15">
in 520, almo&s;t a hundred years after St Au&s;tin, mentions, in &s;everal of his letters, that the theatres were &s;till open at Rome; &s;o that; in all probability, the playhou&s;es were not totally &s;hut till the &s;ack of Rome by Totila; then, indeed, when the wives and children of the Patricians were compelled to beg their bread at the doors of their own palaces, plays, players, arts, &s;ciences, and even the Roman name, &s;unk in one univer&s;al ruin.</P>
<P>In conjunction with Collier, and the other virulent declaimers again&s;t the &s;tage, you &s;eem to lay infinite &s;tre&s;s on the authorities of tho&s;e fathers who have condemned it, without once con&s;idering where they lived, and when they wrote. Clemens wrote in 192, Chry&s;o&s;tom in 354, St Augu&s;tin in 436, all of them in Italy, when their followers were few, and tho&s;e too newly converted. Fea&s;ts, in&s;tituted in honour of the Heathen gods, were undoubtedly not only very indecent, but very dangerous &s;ights for Chri&s;tian converts; they might have revi|ved an affection for their ancient rites. But what is all this to us? we have not the &s;ame danger to apprehend. I never heard that Mr Garrick &s;acrificed to Pan, or Mr Rich danced a jigg in honour of Cybele. The prohibition of the Roman theatres to the primitive Chri|&s;tians, has no more relation to our playhou&s;es, than to a hor&s;e-race at Barnet, or a ball upon my Lord Mayor's day.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="16">
<HI>Ob&s;erv.]</HI> Mr <HI>Squintum</HI> has preached cha&s;tity, ju&s;tice, and hone&s;ty; temperance, &s;obriety, and loyalty; and that with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that if there &s;hould be a rebellion in England to-morrow, which God of his infinite mercy forbid, he does not doubt but that twenty thou&s;and of his flock, fraught with the&s;e principles, would ri&s;e with one hand and one heart, to repel the invaders of their king and country.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> You &s;eem to think, Sir, that the loyal|ty of your favourite pa&s;tor &s;hould &s;creen his ignorance, and &s;helter his impo&s;ition. I did not, indeed, at fir&s;t conceive, of what con&s;e|quence to the public your friend's political creed would be, till you your&s;elf have given me a mo&s;t alarming rea&s;on. Twenty thou&s;and men are, it &s;eems, ready to take the field, whenever their &s;piritual guide &s;hall give the word of command I am very &s;orry, Sir, that any &s;uch power &s;hould be lodged in other hands, than where the con&s;titution has thought proper to place it, but more e&s;pecially in <HI>&s;uch</HI> hands. The A&s;iatic impo&s;tor &s;ubjugated almo&s;t all the Ea&s;t, with le&s;s than half that number of men; but, as I &s;uppo&s;e this declaration will be canva&s;&s;ed in another place, and, if true, its con&s;equences properly guarded again&s;t, I &s;hall refer it to their con&s;ideration, to whom it more immediately belongs. But pray, Sir, who a|mong&s;t you are the Antinomians? Are the doctrines of that &s;ect the tenets of the taber|nacle? In vain are human laws in&s;tituted to guard the lives and properties of individuals,
<PB N="17" REF="17">
if a religion be tolerated which makes it a merit to deprive them of both. The greater crime you commit, the greater glory you give to God; the virtue of the blood of Chri&s;t being render|ed meritorious in proportion to the greatne&s;s of the offence it is to expia$e. This very opi|nion I received, as the found &s;en&s;e of the go|&s;pel, in the village I now write from.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erv.]</HI> What wealth has Mr <HI>Squintum</HI> a|ma&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> He is, I believe, too cunning to let any body into that &s;ecret: but from your com|putation of males fit to carry arms, who are li&s;ted in his &s;ervice, and the price they are well known to pay for admittance, even into the gallery of his theatre, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e his an|nual income mu&s;t double that of the Primate's. To this may be added private benefactions, and occa&s;ional contributions. The proportion of this that he allows to the poor, who, but him|&s;elf, can di&s;cover? Some &s;pecious o&s;tentatious acts of it (for it is a pro&s;titution of the word to call it Charity) are the mere tricks of his trade, the baits, the &s;pringes.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;erv.]</HI> Foote, in his MINOR, has put ex|pre&s;&s;ions into the mouth of Mrs Cole, a bawd, fit only to be uttered by the devil.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> Why, they do come from the mouth of a being very little better than the devil; but
<PB N="18" REF="18">
for tho&s;e &s;he or her teachers are an&s;werable, not your humble &s;ervant; the&s;e are <HI>her</HI> words, not <HI>mine.</HI> Would you have a mirror reflect beauty from deformity? I do my duty, if the copy is a faithful tran&s;cript of the original; and of that the public are judges. The plain points to be determined are the&s;e: Is there &s;uch a character in nature as Mrs Cole? That grant|ed, is that character a proper object for the &s;tage? Why, if a detection of the mo&s;t con&s;um|mate hypocri&s;y, and guarding the mo&s;t inno|cent and un&s;u&s;pecting part of the creation from the crafts and &s;ubtleties of the mo&s;t artful and de&s;igning, be of u&s;e to &s;ociety, no object &s;o proper; but then the words, <HI>providence, rege|neration, grace, new-birth,</HI> &s;hould they be &s;poken upon a theatre? why not?</P>
<P>Though the abu&s;e of the&s;e words may (as it is intended it &s;hould) ca&s;t an odium on the character that mi&s;applies them; yet &s;urely no di&s;honour is reflected on the words them&s;elves, or the ideas they repre&s;ent. Does any man con|demn Ben John&s;on for giving his hypocritical &s;aints, Tribulation and Ananias, the language of the &s;cripture, though employed in a work diametrically oppo&s;ite to the &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the &s;cripture? But to ridicule what is &s;aid in a church?&mdash;and why not&punc; if what is &s;aid there de&s;erves ridicule? Is it a crime to pick a pocket at church? Its being a church is an additional rea&s;on why a man &s;hould not have done it; but it is no argument why he &s;hould not be pu|ni&s;hed for doing it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="19">
But if words, which are the mere arbitrary marks of things, are by any u&s;e &s;o con&s;ecrated, as never to be produced but in a particular &s;er|vice, what apology can you make for your prin|cipal, who&s;e conver&s;ation is an eternal pro&s;ti|tution both of words and things? If profane|ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in idly mentioning the Supreme Being, what offender mu&s;t he be, that makes him a principal agent in the mo&s;t trifling, common occurrences? If he is bit by fleas, he is buffeted by Satan: if he has the good for|tune to catch them, God will &s;ubdue his ene|mies under his feet.</P>
<P><HI>[To the</HI> REMARKS <HI>are added &s;ome Ver&s;es, which</HI> Mr Foote <HI>has thus taken notice of.]</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.]</HI> I &s;hall not animadvert upon the pretty copy of ver&s;es with which you have clo&s;ed your pamphlet: though, for decency's &s;ake, if you are a mini&s;ter of the church of Chri&s;t, I hope you are not impious enough to chant &s;uch compo&s;itions in your places of wor&s;hip, by the way of giving glory to God. There is a place, you &s;ay, where &s;aints &s;hall enjoy</P>
<Q><L>Eternal re&s;t, an active, bli&s;sful &s;tate,</L>
<L>Joy, ever new, tran&s;porting, ever great.</L></Q>
<P>I hope, Sir, in this paradi&s;e of your own manufacture, you will allow your &s;aints, after their active re&s;t, a &s;up of dry drink, and let them ju&s;t take a waking nap, by way of a little

fatiguing refre&s;hment. The Climax too in your next line is extremely happy; Joys not only tran&s;porting, but great: but this is a trifle to what occurs in the progre&s;s of your poem; you there make a conveyance to your di&s;ciples of certain &s;eats you pretend to have in the realms above, and you promi&s;e them not only a good neighbourhood of patriarchs, apo&s;tles, and martyrs, but that the Tottenham teacher him|&s;elf &s;hall certainly &s;ettle among&s;t them. This puts me in mind of what happened at a certain place, in &s;umming up the evidence again&s;t a libeller of the revolution: <Q>&startq;The pri&s;oner has dared, gentlemen, to vilify even the revolu|tion, gentlemen; a mea&s;ure, gentlemen, vi|&s;ibly begun, conducted, and completed, by the peculiar interpo&s;ition of divine Provi|dence; and not only that, gentlemen, but confirmed by act of parliament.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Your two next lines, and the la&s;t I &s;hall meddle with, are,</P>
<Q><L>In lofty &s;trains, which angels cannot &s;ing,</L>
<L>There &s;aints &s;hall prai&s;e their Prie&s;t and heavenly King.</L></Q>
<P>And why can't the angels &s;ing the &s;trains? What, perhaps they are of your own compo&s;ing? Otherwi&s;e, we are told, that to &s;ing prai&s;es, was one great purpo&s;e of their creation. But I for|get, the&s;e are your own angels too; nay, it's but rea&s;onable you &s;hould people your paradi&s;e. Fye upon you; are you not a&s;hamed to cajole
<PB N="21" REF="21">
a parcel of ignorant mechanics into a belief, that by chanting &s;uch inexplicable non&s;en&s;e they are performing a &s;acrifice of prai&s;e agree|able to the great Author of their being!</P>
<P>It is a&s;&s;erted, and with truth, that at the ex|hibition of the MINOR in this town, when Mr Foote was called upon by the public to give them the Epilogue, he apologi$ed for the omi&s;|&s;ion by the application of a law of Solon's to the recent death of the Tottenham-Court preacher;</P>
<Q>De mortuis nil ni&s;i bonum.</Q>
<P>But this was rather a conde&s;cen&s;ion to the ge|neral prejudice of mankind, than to any con|viction of the propriety of the law.</P>
<P>If the examples of bad men are to be point|ed out as matter of caution to the re&s;t of their fellow-creatures, it can, by the con&s;titution of the&s;e countries, be only done after their death: for, during their lives, their characters, how|ever infamous, are guarded by the laws again&s;t libels. And indeed, the contrary practice pre|vailed among&s;t the Romans. To prove this, I need only cite their cu&s;tom of appointing public orators at the funeral of their principal citizens. The orator frequently a&s;&s;umed the per&s;on of the decea&s;ed. A pa&s;&s;age, which occurred at the
<PB N="22" REF="22">
death of an avaritious Emperor, cannot be for|got, when a &s;um was voted by the Senate for his funeral. <HI>Give me,</HI> &s;ays the Monarch's re|pre&s;entative, <HI>the money; and, if you plea&s;e, throw my body into the Tyber.</HI></P>
